Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to compute the expected value of the variable 'ans' after running some code. Then, multiply that expected value by n^k and output it modulo 998244353. Hmm.

First, I need to understand what the code does. Let's look at the code mentioned in the problem. Oh right, the code isn't provided, but the problem statement says that we have to calculate the expected value of 'ans' after performing the code. Wait, the code must be the one described in the problem's first paragraph. Let me recheck.

The code is probably the one with the loops. Let me imagine: the code probably loops k times, and in each iteration, it picks an element from the array uniformly at random, replaces it with some value, and accumulates the sum into ans. But wait, the problem says that the expected value is after performing the code, so I need to model exactly what the code does.

Wait, the problem statement says: "the following code with it". The code is likely similar to something like this:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    i = random index (0..n-1)
    ans += a[i]
    a[i] = a[i] - (a[i] mod i)  -- wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the code is:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    i = random(0, n-1)
    ans += a[i]
    a[i] = (a[i] * x + y) mod M -- but no, the code's operations are probably different. Wait, the problem's input includes x, y, M, but those are for generating the array. The code's operations must be something else. Or maybe the code modifies the array in some way each time.

Wait, the problem's code could be:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    i = choose uniformly at random an index from 0 to n-1
    ans += a[i]
    a[i] = f(a[i]) for some function f.

But how to model this. Let me check the sample input. For example, in the first sample, after 13 steps, the expected value is computed, then multiplied by 3^13.

But the problem says that the code is such that for each of the k steps, we pick an element randomly, add it to ans, and possibly modify it. So the steps are:

Initially, the array a is as generated. Then, in each of the k steps:

- Select an index i uniformly at random (each index has 1/n probability).
- Add a[i] to ans.
- Replace a[i] with some new value, possibly depending on its current value.

Wait, but what's the replacement rule here? The problem statement doesn't specify. Wait, the problem's code might be the same as the code in the note. Wait, the problem says that the array is generated using a_i = (a_{i-1} * x + y) mod M. But that's the input generation part. The code that's being run (the code that the problem refers to) must be something else. Wait, perhaps the code is the one that does the following:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    index = random(0, n-1)
    ans += a[index]
    a[index] = (a[index] * x + y) mod M

But no, the x and y here are part of the input generation. Alternatively, maybe the code replaces a[i] with a[i] mod (i+1), but that's just a guess. Wait, no. The problem's note for the first example has the array [10, 35, 22]. Then, the code in question must be the one that, in each step, picks a random element, adds it to ans, and then replaces it with (a_i mod d), where d is something. But the sample input's output is 382842030, which suggests that after 13 steps, each step contributes to the sum. So I need to model exactly what the code does.

Wait, perhaps the code is as follows. Let's read the problem statement again. The problem says:

"You perform the following code with it:

Your task is to calculate the expected value of the variable ans after performing this code."

But the code isn't written here. Wait, perhaps the code is the one that, for each of the k steps, selects a random element, adds it to ans, and replaces it with its remainder modulo some number. Or perhaps the code is the same as the one used to generate the array. But that's unclear.

Wait, this is a problem from a programming competition. Looking back at the input format, the code that the problem refers to must involve the array being modified in some way. But perhaps the code is similar to:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    i = random index (0..n-1)
    ans += a[i]
    a[i] = (a[i] * x + y) mod M

But x and y here are the ones given in the input. Wait, but the input already uses x and y to generate the initial array. So maybe after each selection, the code replaces a[i] with (a[i] * x + y) mod M. That would make sense. Let's see.

But how to confirm. Let's take the first sample input:

n=3, a0=10, x=3, y=5, k=13, M=88.

The array is [10, (10*3+5)=35 mod88=35, (35*3+5)=110 mod88=22]. So the initial array is [10,35,22].

If the code is, for each step, pick a random index, add a[i] to ans, then set a[i] = (a[i]*x + y) mod M. Then in each step, the selected element is modified.

But in that case, after each selection, the element is updated using the same x and y as in the input. So for example, if in the first step, we select the first element (10), add it to ans, then update it to (10*3+5)=35 mod88=35.

But then in subsequent steps, if we select that index again, the value would be 35, then 35*3+5=110 mod88=22, etc. So each time you pick an element, it's transformed by the same x and y as the input. So the code for the problem's code is:

ans = 0
for _ in range(k):
    i = random integer in 0..n-1
    ans += a[i]
    a[i] = (a[i] * x + y) mod M

But is that correct? That would align with how the initial array is generated. So the code uses the same x and y as in the input to generate the array and also to modify elements after each selection.

If this is the case, then the problem reduces to, for each of the k steps, each element has a 1/n probability of being selected. Each selection contributes the current value of a[i] to ans, and then a[i] is transformed into (a[i] * x + y) mod M.

The challenge is to compute the expected sum E of ans after k steps, then output E multiplied by n^k modulo 998244353.

But given that n can be up to 1e7 and k up to 17, how do we model this efficiently?

So the approach must be to model, for each step, the expected contribution of each element. Then, sum all these contributions across steps and elements.

But since each element's state changes over time depending on whether it's selected in previous steps, we need to model the probability that an element is in a certain state at a certain step.

But given that the elements are processed in a way that their transformations are deterministic once they are selected (since each selection applies the same function (ax + y) mod M), perhaps we can model for each element, the expected value it contributes across the k steps, considering the probability that it's selected in each step, and the possible transformations if it's selected multiple times.

But considering that each element is treated independently (since the selection of one element doesn't affect the others except for their own transformations), perhaps we can compute for each element the total contribution to the expected value and then sum them all.

Yes. Because the elements are independent in their contributions. So for each element a_i, the expected contribution to ans is the sum over each of the k steps of the expected value of a_i at that step multiplied by the probability that it's selected in that step (1/n).

But since each element can be selected multiple times, each time being transformed. So the key is to model for each element, the expected value it contributes in each of the k steps.

Let me think. Let's model for a single element. Let's say we have an element that starts at some initial value. For each step, there's a 1/n chance that this element is selected. If it's selected in step t, then in that step, the element's current value is added to ans, and then it is transformed. If it's not selected, then the element's value remains as it was.

So for each element, the value can change over time based on how many times it has been selected before each step. For example, if an element is never selected in the first t-1 steps, then its value in step t is the initial value. If it's selected once in step 3, then in step 4, if selected again, it's (a_initial * x + y) mod M.

But modeling all possible possibilities for each element across k steps seems computationally heavy, but since k is small (up to 17), perhaps we can model the state of an element in terms of how many times it has been transformed.

Each time the element is selected, it undergoes a transformation. The transformations are applied in sequence each time the element is selected. So, for an element that has been selected m times, its value is f^m(a_initial), where f is the transformation function (a -> (a * x + y) mod M).

Wait, but the order of selection matters. For example, if the element is selected in step 1 and then again in step 2, then after step 1, it's f(a_initial), then in step 2, it's f(f(a_initial)).

So the state of the element after m transformations is f applied m times to the initial value.

Thus, the problem reduces to, for each element, compute for each step t (from 1 to k) the expected number of times the element has been selected up to step t-1 (i.e., before step t). Because each selection in step s (s < t) may have transformed the element, so the value in step t depends on the number of transformations (m) applied to the element before step t.

But how to model the probability that the element has been selected m times in the first t-1 steps.

Alternatively, for each element, and for each step t (1 <= t <= k), compute the expected value of the element at step t, then sum all those expected values multiplied by 1/n (the probability of being selected in that step).

The total contribution of the element is the sum over t=1 to k of (E_t) * (1/n), where E_t is the expected value of the element at step t.

So for each element, compute sum_{t=1 to k} E_t / n.

Then multiply this by n^k (since the problem requires E * n^k), which would give sum_{t=1 to k} E_t * n^{k-1}.

But how to compute E_t for each element.

E_t is the expected value of the element at step t. To compute E_t, we need to model the number of times the element was selected in the previous t-1 steps. Each selection applies the transformation function once.

But since each selection of the element is a Bernoulli trial with probability 1/n per step, the number of times the element is selected in the first t-1 steps follows a binomial distribution. However, since each selection in a step affects the state of the element, the problem is to track the expected value after m transformations, multiplied by the probability that m transformations have occurred before step t.

So for E_t, the expected value is sum_{m=0}^{t-1} P(m, t-1) * f^m(a), where P(m, t-1) is the probability that the element has been selected exactly m times in the first t-1 steps.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

First, note that for each element, the initial value is a_i. The function f is applied m times if the element was selected m times before step t.

The probability that the element was selected m times in the first t-1 steps is C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ( (n-1)/n )^{t-1 -m} }, since each step is an independent trial with probability 1/n.

But for k up to 17, t-1 can be up to 16. So for each t, m can be from 0 to t-1. Since k is small (up to 17), this is manageable.

So for each element a_j (which is generated as per the initial array), and for each t in 1..k, compute the sum over m=0 to t-1 of [ probability of m selections in first t-1 steps ] * [ f^m(a_j) ].

Then sum all these for all elements and all t steps, multiply by 1/n (the probability of being selected in step t), then multiply by n^k (since the required output is E * n^k mod 998244353).

Wait, but the expected sum is the sum over each step of the expected contribution in that step. The contribution of step t is the sum over all elements of (probability that element is selected in step t) multiplied by the expected value of the element at that step.

So for each step t, each element contributes (1/n) * E_t, where E_t is the expected value of the element at step t. The total expected sum is sum_{t=1 to k} sum_{elements} (1/n * E_t).

Then, when multiplied by n^k, this becomes sum_{t=1 to k} sum_{elements} E_t * n^{k-1}.

But the sum over elements can be handled by precomputing for each possible m (number of transformations) the sum of f^m(a_j) across all elements. Because for each element, the sum over m is sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ( (n-1)/n )^{t-1 -m} } * f^m(a_j) ].

But since the elements are generated in a way that a_j is a_i = (a_{i-1} * x + y) mod M, which is a linear congruential generator (LCG), the array is generated with a_j = (a_0 * x^j + y * (x^{j-1} + x^{j-2} + ... + x^0 )) ) mod M. But since M is up to 998244353, and n can be up to 1e7, precomputing each a_j and then f^m(a_j) for all m up to 17 is possible, but storing 1e7 elements each with 17 possible transformed values would take 1.7e8 entries, which is 170MB. That's manageable.

Wait, but for each element j, to compute f^m(a_j) for m up to 16 (since k is up to 17, so t-1 can be up to 16). So for each element, precompute f^0(a_j) (the initial value), f^1(a_j) = (a_j *x +y) mod M, f^2(a_j) = (f^1(a_j)*x + y) mod M, etc., up to m=16.

Then, for each element j, and each t from 1 to k, the sum for E_t is sum_{m=0}^{t-1} C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ((n-1)/n)^{t-1 -m} * f^m(a_j).

But even so, for each element and each t, this is O(t) operations. With n up to 1e7 and k up to 17, this would be O(1e7 * 17 * 17) = 2.89e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Since all elements are generated via a LCG, and the transformations f are the same as the LCG (since f is (a *x + y) mod M), then each time you apply f to an element, you're effectively generating the next element in the same LCG sequence.

Wait, no. For example, the initial array is generated as a_0, a_1 = (a_0 *x + y) mod M, a_2 = (a_1 *x + y) mod M, etc. So for element j, a_j is the (j)-th term of this LCG. Then, applying f once to a_j gives a_j *x + y mod M = a_{j+1}, because a_{j+1} is exactly (a_j *x + y) mod M. Wait, no. Wait, the array a is built with a_0 given, then a_1 = (a_0 *x + y) mod M, a_2 = (a_1 *x + y) mod M, etc. So applying f to a_j gives a_{j+1}. So each element j, when transformed once via f, becomes a_{j+1}. But the array is only length n. So for j up to n-1.

Wait, but after the array is generated, each element j (0-based) in the array is a_j = (a_{j-1} *x + y) mod M. So when we apply f to a_j, we get (a_j *x + y) mod M = a_{j+1}, but j can be up to n-1. So applying f to a_{n-1} would give (a_{n-1} *x + y) mod M, which is not part of the initial array.

But regardless, the key insight here is that applying f m times to a_j is equivalent to computing a_{j + m}, but this is only true if the LCG is the same. Wait, because the LCG parameters x and y are fixed. So for any element a_j, applying f once gives a_{j+1}, applying it again gives a_{j+2}, etc. So f^m(a_j) = a_{j+m}.

But wait, the initial array a is built as a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then, applying f to a_{n-1} gives a_n, which is not part of the initial array. So for elements in the array, their transformations via f produce a sequence beyond the initial array.

But for our problem, each time the element is selected, it's transformed via f, which is the same as the LCG that generated the array. So for any element j in the array, after being selected m times, its value is a_{j + m}.

But this is a crucial insight. So for any element j (original index in the array), the m-th transformation (i.e., m applications of f) would take its value to a_{j + m}.

So for the initial element j, after being selected m times, its value is a_{j + m}.

So this is a key observation. So the sum for E_t for element j is sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ P(m, t-1) ] * a_{j + m}.

Wait, because f^m(a_j) is a_{j + m} ?

Yes. Because a_{j} is (a_{j-1} *x + y) mod M. So applying f once gives (a_j *x + y) mod M = a_{j+1}. So applying m times f to a_j gives a_{j + m}.

So, the value of the element j after m transformations is a_{j + m}.

So this is a big simplification. Therefore, for any element j (0-based in the original array), after being selected m times, its value is a_{j + m}.

Therefore, for each element j, the expected value E_t (the value in step t) is sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ probability of being selected m times in t-1 steps ] * a_{j + m}.

So the problem now becomes:

For each element j (0 <= j < n), for each step t (1 <= t <= k), compute the sum over m=0 to t-1 of C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ((n-1)/n)^(t-1 -m) * a_{j + m}.

Then, sum over all j and all t, multiply each term by (1/n) (probability of selecting j in step t), and then multiply by n^k to get the required result.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The sum for all j and t is sum_{t=1}^k sum_{j=0}^{n-1} sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ((n-1)/n)^{t-1 -m} * a_{j + m} ] * (1/n) * n^k.

Simplifying this expression:

The (1/n) comes from the selection probability in step t. The n^k comes from multiplying E by n^k. So:

Each term in the sum is:

C(t-1, m) * (1/n)^m * ((n-1)/n)^{t-1 -m} * a_{j + m} * (1/n) * n^k.

Simplify the exponents:

(1/n)^m * ( (n-1)/n )^{t-1 - m} * (1/n) = ( (n-1)^{t-1 -m} ) / n^{t-1 -m} ) * (1/n^{m}) * 1/n )

= (n-1)^{t-1 -m} / (n^{t-1 -m} * n^{m} * n^1) )

= (n-1)^{t-1 -m} / (n^{t} )

So the term becomes:

C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^{t-1 -m} / n^{t} ) * a_{j +m} * n^k

= C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^{t-1 -m} * a_{j + m} * n^{k - t}.

So the total sum is sum_{t=1}^k sum_{j=0}^{n-1} sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^{t-1 -m} * a_{j + m} * n^{k - t} ].

But this seems complicated. Let's see if we can rearrange the summations.

Notice that for each t, and each m in 0..t-1, and j in 0..n-1, the term a_{j + m} is involved. So j + m can be up to (n-1) + (t-1) = n + t-2. But the original array is a_0 ... a_{n-1}, and a_{n} is generated as (a_{n-1} *x + y) mod M, a_{n+1} is (a_n *x + y) mod M, etc. So to compute a_{j+m}, we need to generate up to a_{n-1 + (k-1)}, since m can be up to t-1 and t is up to k.

So for the initial array, we can generate a_0 up to a_{n + k -1} (since j can be up to n-1 and m up to k-1). Then, for each term a_{j + m}, j + m can be up to (n-1) + (k-1) = n +k-2. So generating the first n +k terms (0 to n+k-1) would suffice.

But generating a_0 to a_{n + k -1} is feasible since n can be 1e7 and k up to 17, leading to 1e7+17 elements. For M up to 1e9 (since M is up to 998244353), each element can be generated in O(1) time, so the total time is O(n +k) which is acceptable.

Once we have the a array up to a_{n +k -1}, we can compute the required sums.

Now, let's think about the sum over j and m. For a given m and t, the sum over j is sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_{j + m}.

But j ranges from 0 to n-1, so j + m ranges from m to n-1 + m. For each m, the sum is sum_{s=m}^{m +n-1} a_s.

So for each m in 0..k-1 (since t can be up to k, so m can be up to k-1), we can precompute the sum S[m] = sum_{s=m}^{m +n -1} a_s.

But wait, m can be up to k-1, and m +n -1 can be up to (k-1) + (n-1) = n +k-2. Since the a array is built up to n +k -1, this is covered.

So for each possible m (up to k-1), compute S[m] = sum_{s=m}^{m+n-1} a_s.

Then, the total sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{t=1}^k sum_{m=0}^{t-1} [ C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^{t-1 -m} * S[m] * n^{k -t} } ]

So the problem now reduces to:

1. Generate a_0 to a_{n +k -1}.

2. Precompute S[m] for m from 0 to k-1.

3. For each t from 1 to k, and for each m from 0 to t-1, compute the term C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^(t-1 -m) * S[m] * n^{k -t}.

Sum all these terms.

But how to compute S[m] for each m.

Let's think: S[m] is the sum of a[m], a[m+1], ..., a[m +n -1].

But when m >=1, this is the same as the sum of the next n elements starting at a[m].

So for example, S[0] is sum_{s=0}^{n-1} a_s, S[1] is sum_{s=1}^n a_s, etc.

So to compute S[m] for m up to k-1 (since m can be up to t-1, which is up to k-1 when t is k).

But since k is up to 17, m can be up to 16.

So for each m in 0..16, compute the sum of a[m..m+n-1].

But generating these sums is challenging if n is up to 1e7. Because for each m, the sum is O(n) operations, leading to O(k * n) time, which is 1.7e8 operations, which is manageable.

But wait, the array a is up to n +k -1 elements. So for m up to k-1=16, each sum S[m] is from a[m] to a[m +n-1], which is exactly the original array's sum when m=0. For m=1, it's a[1] to a[n], which is a sum of n elements. So for each m from 0 to k-1, we need to compute the sum of a[m] to a[m +n -1].

But for m up to k-1, m +n-1 is (k-1) + (n-1) = n +k-2. Which is covered by the a array generated up to n +k -1.

So to compute S[m] for each m in 0..k-1, we can precompute a prefix sum array, then compute S[m] as prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m].

Yes. Let's precompute the prefix sum array of a, where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of a_0 to a_{i-1}. Then, sum_{s = m}^{m +n-1} a_s = prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m].

So generating the prefix sum array for the first (n +k) elements (since m +n can be up to (k-1) +n = n +k-1) would allow us to compute all S[m] efficiently.

Thus, steps to solve the problem:

1. Generate the array a up to a_{n +k -1}.

2. Compute the prefix sum array of a.

3. Precompute S[m] for each m from 0 to k-1 as prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m].

4. Precompute the necessary combinations C(t-1, m) for all t and m (since t can be up to k, m up to t-1).

5. Precompute powers of (n-1) up to exponent k-1, and powers of n up to exponent k.

6. For each t in 1..k, and m in 0..t-1, calculate the term C(t-1, m) * (n-1)^(t-1 -m) * S[m] * n^{k -t} and sum all such terms.

Now, let's think about the details.

First, generating a up to a_{n +k -1}:

The initial array is a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then, to generate a_{n}, a_{n+1}, ..., a_{n +k -1}, we can continue the LCG process. So for each i >=n, a_i = (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M.

But generating this for i up to n +k -1 is O(k) steps, which is trivial.

Second, compute the prefix sums. The prefix sum array for a_0 to a_{n +k -1} can be computed in O(n +k) time. For example, prefix_sum[0] =0, prefix_sum[1] =a_0, prefix_sum[2] =a_0 +a_1, etc.

Third, precompute S[m] for m in 0..k-1. Each S[m] is sum from a[m] to a[m +n-1], which is prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m].

Fourth, precompute combinations. We need C(t-1, m) for t up to k (t ranges from 1 to k) and m up to t-1 (so up to 16). The maximum required combination is C(16, 16) =1. The combinations can be precomputed using Pascal's triangle up to 16.

Fifth, precompute pow(n-1, e) for e up to k-1 (since t-1 -m can be up to (k-1) -0 =k-1). Similarly, precompute pow(n, e) for e up to k (since k -t can be up to k-1, as t starts from 1).

But exponentiating for these values is manageable. For example, for e up to 17, we can precompute them with a loop.

Now, the modular aspects: all computations must be modulo 998244353. So all the combinations, powers, and sum terms must be computed modulo 998244353.

Wait, but the problem says that the answer is E * n^k modulo 998244353, and E is the expected value. So all terms must be computed under modulo 998244353.

But what about the sum of a[m] to a[m +n-1], which is S[m]? Since each a_i is computed modulo M, but M can be up to 998244353. But when M is equal to 998244353, the sum could be up to 1e7 * 1e9, which would overflow even 64-bit integers. So we need to compute the prefix sums modulo 998244353 as well.

But the problem requires that the output is the sum multiplied by n^k mod 998244353. So all steps must be computed modulo 998244353.

Therefore, the steps must be done under modulo 998244353.

But when generating a_i, since M is given and a_i is generated as (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M, but we need to store a_i modulo 998244353. Wait, no. Because the sum S[m] is sum of a_i's mod 998244353. But the a_i's are computed modulo M. So when M is different from 998244353, the sum of a_i's must be computed as their actual values modulo M, then summed, and then modulo 998244353. But this is not correct. The problem says that a_i is computed mod M, but the sum S[m] is sum of a_i's (mod M) multiplied by various terms mod 998244353.

But the problem's output requires that the final answer is computed modulo 998244353, regardless of M. So all arithmetic should be done modulo 998244353. But the a_i's are computed mod M. Wait, but the problem statement says that the a_i's are computed mod M, but when summed, they can be added as integers (mod 998244353) because the problem's output is computed mod 998244353.

But for example, if M is 2 and 998244353 is a large prime, then a_i can be 0 or 1. The sum of n terms could be up to n. So adding them modulo 998244353 is correct.

Therefore, when computing the prefix sum array, we should take the sum modulo 998244353.

Wait, but the problem requires that we compute the exact sum of a_i's, then multiply by the appropriate factors mod 998244353. However, since each a_i is computed mod M, but M can be up to 998244353, but the sum of the a_i's can be up to n*(M-1). When M is 998244353, this sum can be up to 1e7 * 1e9, which is 1e16. But in Python, integers can handle this. However, when modding by 998244353, we can compute the sum as sum (a_i mod 998244353) for each term, and then take the sum mod 998244353.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because each a_i is (something mod M). So a_i's actual value is between 0 and M-1. So when summed, the sum is the sum of these values. The sum can be up to (1e7) * (998244353 -1) = about 1e16, which is manageable in Python. But when modded by 998244353, this sum mod 998244353 is correct.

But the problem requires that the sum is computed as the sum of the actual a_i's (mod M), then multiplied by various terms mod 998244353. So, we need to compute the sum S[m] as the sum of a[m], a[m+1], ..., a[m +n-1] mod 998244353.

But the a_i's are generated as (previous *x + y) mod M. So each a_i is in [0, M-1]. Therefore, the sum of n a_i's can be up to n*(M-1). For M up to 998244353 and n up to 1e7, this sum can be up to ~ 1e7 * 1e9 = 1e16. But in Python, summing these as integers and then modding is manageable.

But when we precompute the prefix sum array, we need to compute the sum mod 998244353. So during the prefix sum computation, each term is added to the sum and then modded by 998244353. This way, the prefix_sum array is stored mod 998244353, which allows us to compute S[m] as (prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m]) mod 998244353.

Yes. Because:

sum_{s= m}^{m +n -1} a_s = (sum_{s=0}^{m +n -1} a_s ) - sum_{s=0}^{m-1} a_s )

Which is equal to prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m], where prefix_sum[i] is sum of a_0 to a_{i-1}.

So if the prefix sum is computed modulo 998244353, then the difference is also mod 998244353.

Therefore, the steps are:

Generate a_0 ... a_{n +k -1}, each stored as (a_{i} mod M), then stored as their value mod 998244353 when computing the prefix sum.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The array a is generated with each a_i = (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M. But when we compute the sum for S[m], we need to sum the actual values (mod M) of a_i's. However, the sum is computed modulo 998244353. So each a_i's value (mod M) is added to the sum, which is then modded by 998244353. So for example, if a_i is 1e9 (mod M), but M is 2, then a_i is 0 mod M. But for the sum, we need to sum 0's. But if M is 3 and a_i is 2, then that 2 is added to the sum.

So the a_i's should be stored as their actual values mod M. Wait, but no. Because the problem's code uses the a_i's as per their mod M values. So the code's ans += a[i], which is the value after mod M. So the sum S[m] must be the sum of a[m] to a[m +n-1], where each a_i is mod M. However, since these are summed, and then multiplied by terms mod 998244353, the sum can be computed mod 998244353. Because when you multiply two numbers mod 998244353, the result is the same as if you first mod them each and then multiply.

But wait, the sum of a_i's (mod M) can be computed as (sum mod M), but the sum in the problem's code is added as integers. So the ans variable is the sum of the a_i's, which are mod M. So the actual sum is the sum of the a_i's as integers (mod M). But when multiplied by other terms mod 998244353, the sum must be computed modulo 998244353.

So, for example, if M is 3, and the sum is 1e9, then the sum mod 3 is 1e9 mod 3. But when multiplied by other terms mod 998244353, the sum mod 998244353 is needed.

So the problem's answer depends on the sum of the a_i's mod 998244353, but each a_i is computed mod M. So the sum can be computed as the sum of (a_i mod M) mod 998244353, and then multiplied by the other terms mod 998244353.

Therefore, when generating the a array, each a_i is computed as (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M. Then, to compute the sum S[m], each a_i is stored as (a_i mod M) and summed mod 998244353.

Yes, because the code's ans is sum of a_i's mod M. But the problem requires that the expected sum E is computed, which is the sum of all the contributions from each step. Each contribution is the a_i's value (mod M) multiplied by the probability of being chosen. Then, when multiplied by n^k, it's all modulo 998244353.

Therefore, the a_i's in the code are mod M, but when summed in the problem's code, the ans is the sum of these mod M values. However, when computing the expected value E, which is a real number, and then multiplied by n^k, the result is an integer. Since all operations must be done mod 998244353, the sum S[m] must be computed as the sum of a_i mod M, and then summed mod 998244353.

Therefore, the correct approach is to generate each a_i as (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M, and then compute their sums mod 998244353.

So steps to generate the a array:

For each i from 0 to (n +k -1):

a_i = (a_{i-1} *x + y) mod M

But for i starting from 1. But since a_0 is given.

Then, compute prefix_sum[i] = (prefix_sum[i-1] + a_{i-1}) mod MOD, where MOD is 998244353.

This way, the sum S[m] is (prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m}) mod MOD.

Now, the code steps:

Generate a array:

Initialize a as a list where a[0] is the given a0.

For i in 1 to (n +k -1):

a[i] = (a[i-1] *x + y) % M

Compute the prefix_sum array modulo MOD.

Compute S[m] = (prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m]) % MOD for each m from 0 to k-1.

Now, compute the combinations C(t-1, m) for all t up to k and m up to t-1.

We can precompute a Pascal triangle for combinations up to k-1 (since t-1 can be up to k-1). For example, for k=17, the maximum t-1 is 16. So a 17x17 table is sufficient.

Next, precompute the powers of (n-1) modulo MOD for exponents up to (k-1) (since t-1 -m can be up to k-1 when m=0 and t-1=k-1).

Similarly, precompute the powers of n modulo MOD for exponents up to k (since k -t can be up to k-1 when t=1).

But since MOD is a prime (998244353), we can compute these exponents using pow with mod.

Now, the main loop:

Initialize the answer to 0.

For each t from 1 to k:

   For each m from 0 to t-1:

      term = C(t-1, m) * pow(n-1, t-1 -m, MOD) % MOD

      term = term * S[m] % MOD

      term = term * pow(n, k -t, MOD) % MOD

      answer = (answer + term) % MOD

Sum all such terms.

Return answer mod MOD.

This approach should be efficient because k is small (up to 17), and all steps are O(k^2) operations.

So putting it all together:

First, generate a up to n +k-1.

Compute prefix sums modulo 998244353.

Compute S[m] for m up to k-1.

Precompute combinations.

Precompute exponents.

Loop over t and m to compute the sum.

Now, the code:

But handling the large n (up to 1e7) and generating the a array.

But generating a array up to n +k-1 is O(n +k) time. Since n is up to 1e7 and k up to 17, this is manageable.

But in Python, generating a list of 1e7+17 elements can take some memory. For example, each element is an integer, so for 1e7 elements, it's about 40MB per million entries (since each int is 28 bytes). So 1e7 entries would be about 280MB. Adding 17 more is negligible. But considering that the memory limit is 512MB, this is acceptable.

Alternatively, we can generate the a array on the fly and compute the prefix sums without storing all the a's, but this is more complex.

But given that the problem's constraints allow for up to 512MB, storing the a array up to n +k-1 is feasible.

Wait, but for n=1e7 and k=17, the a array is 1e7+17 elements, which is about 1e7 elements. So in Python, each list element is 4 bytes (for small integers, but Python's ints are larger). However, even if each element takes 8 bytes, it's 8e7 bytes = 80MB, which is manageable.

So the code steps:

Read n, a0, x, y, k, M.

Compute MOD = 998244353.

Generate a array:

a = [a0] if n >=1.

Wait, no. The array a has length n +k -1? Because we need a_0 to a_{n+k-1}?

Wait, the initial array is a_0 to a_{n-1}. Then, for the elements j in 0..n-1, when m is up to k-1 (since t can be up to k), the sum S[m] is sum a_{m} ... a_{m +n-1}. So for m =k-1, m +n-1 =k-1 +n-1= n +k-2. So the a array needs to have up to n +k-1 elements. Wait, because the index is m +n-1, which for m =k-1 is (k-1) +n -1 =n +k-2. So the a array needs to be up to a_{n +k-2}, which is generated by the code for i up to n +k -2.

Wait, for the initial array, the first n elements (0 to n-1) are generated. Then, the next k-1 elements (n to n +k -2) are generated. So the total a array length is n +k -1.

Yes.

So steps to generate a array:

a = [a0] if n >=1.

for i in range(1, n +k -1):

   a_i = (a[i-1] *x + y) % M

   append to a.

Then compute the prefix_sum array.

But for n=0, but the constraints say n >=1. Wait, the problem's constraints say 1 <=n <=1e7. So n is at least 1.

So code:

n, a0, x, y, k, M = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 998244353

a = [a0 % M]

for i in range(1, n +k -1):

    next_val = (a[-1] * x + y) % M

    a.append(next_val)

Then compute prefix_sum.

prefix_sum = [0]*(len(a)+1)

for i in range(len(a)):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = (prefix_sum[i] + a[i]) % MOD

Then compute S[m] for m from 0 to k-1.

But m can be up to k-1=16.

But for each m in 0 to k-1:

S[m] = (prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m]) % MOD

But when m +n exceeds the length of a? No, because a has length n +k-1. m can be up to k-1. So m +n can be up to (k-1) +n =n +k-1. So prefix_sum has entries up to n +k-1. So a[m +n-1] is the last element in the sum for S[m]. So prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m] is correct.

So for m in 0 to k-1:

if m +n > len(a):

    then the sum is from a[m] to a[len(a)-1], but this shouldn't happen because m is up to k-1 and len(a) is n +k-1. So m +n <= (k-1) +n =n +k-1. So prefix_sum has entries up to n +k-1. So m +n is <= (k-1) +n =n +k-1. So the prefix_sum[m +n] is valid.

Thus, S can be computed for all m from 0 to k-1.

Next, precompute combinations C(t-1, m) for t from 1 to k, m up to t-1.

We can precompute a combination table using Pascal's triangle.

max_t = k

comb = [[0]*(max_t) for _ in range(max_t)]

comb[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, max_t):

    comb[i][0] = 1

    for j in range(1, i+1):

        comb[i][j] = (comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j]) % MOD

Wait, but for t-1 up to k-1 (since t can be up to k, t-1 up to k-1). So the maximum required is comb[k-1][m], for m up to k-1.

So the code for comb is:

max_comb = k-1

comb = [[0]*(max_comb +1) for _ in range(max_comb +1)]

comb[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, max_comb +1):

    comb[i][0] = 1

    for j in range(1, i+1):

        comb[i][j] = (comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j]) % MOD

But in code, we can generate a 2D list where comb[t-1][m] is C(t-1, m).

Then, precompute powers of (n-1) up to exponent k-1.

pow_n_minus_1 = [1]*(k)

for e in range(1, k):

    pow_n_minus_1[e] = (pow_n_minus_1[e-1] * (n-1)) % MOD

But since for each t, the exponent is t-1 -m. But m can be up to t-1, so the maximum exponent is t-1 -0 =t-1. Since t can be up to k, the maximum exponent is k-1. So precompute pow_n_minus_1 up to k-1.

Similarly, precompute pow_n up to exponent k.

pow_n = [1]*(k+1)

for e in range(1, k+1):

    pow_n[e] = (pow_n[e-1] * n) % MOD

But wait, in the term n^{k -t}, when t ranges from 1 to k, k-t ranges from k-1 down to 0. So precompute pow_n[e] for e from 0 to k.

Then, for each term, the exponent is k-t. So when t=1, exponent is k-1. When t=k, exponent is 0. So pow_n[k-t] = pow_n[k-1], ..., pow_n[0].

But pow_n is precomputed as [1, n, n^2, ..., n^k].

So for the term n^{k-t} = pow_n[k-t].

Now, the main loop:

ans = 0

for t in range(1, k+1):

    for m in range(0, t):

        # here, t-1 >=m, since m ranges from 0 to t-1.

        # but in code, for t in 1..k, m ranges from 0..t-1.

        # but the way the loops are written, when t is 1, m ranges 0..0.

        # so for each t, m can be from 0 to t-1.

        # compute C(t-1, m)

        current_comb = comb[t-1][m]

        exponent_pow_n_minus_1 = (t-1) - m

        current_pow_n_minus_1 = pow_n_minus_1[exponent_pow_n_minus_1]

        current_S = S[m]

        exponent_n = k - t

        current_pow_n = pow_n[exponent_n]

        term = current_comb * current_pow_n_minus_1 % MOD

        term = term * current_S % MOD

        term = term * current_pow_n % MOD

        ans = (ans + term) % MOD

Return ans.

But wait, the pow_n_minus_1 array has entries up to k-1. For example, when t-1 is up to k-1 (since t ranges to k). For exponent_pow_n_minus_1 = (t-1 -m), which can be as large as (k-1 -0) =k-1. So the precomputed pow_n_minus_1 up to k-1 is sufficient.

So putting it all together:

Now, code:

But in Python, the loops for generating a can be optimized. Since n can be up to 1e7, and k up to 17, the a array can have up to 1e7+16 elements. Generating them in a loop is possible.

But for n=1e7 and k=17, the a array will be 1e7+16 elements, which is about 1e7 elements. This can be generated in a list in Python, but may take some time and memory. However, given the problem's constraints and time limits, it's manageable.

But generating the a array can be done efficiently. For each element, we can compute it iteratively.

Another optimization: since the first n elements are required for the initial array, and the next k-1 elements are needed for the sums S[m], we can generate all elements up to n +k -2 (since the last index is n +k -2).

Wait, the a array is generated from a_0 to a_{n+k-2}? Because when m +n-1 is up to (k-1) +n-1 =n +k-2. So the a array needs to have elements up to index n +k -2.

Yes.

So the code for generating a is:

a = [a0 % M]

for i in range(1, n +k -1):

    next_val = (a[-1] * x + y) % M

    a.append(next_val)

Wait, the first element is a_0. Then, for i=1 to n+k-2, we generate up to a_{n+k-2}. Because the loop runs from 1 to (n+k-2) inclusive. The total number of elements is 1 + (n +k -2) =n +k -1 elements.

So the a array has elements from a_0 to a_{n+k-2}, which is correct.

Then, the prefix sum array is computed as:

prefix_sum = [0] * (len(a) +1)

for i in range(len(a)):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = (prefix_sum[i] + a[i]) % MOD

Then, for each m in 0 to k-1:

S[m] = (prefix_sum[m +n] - prefix_sum[m]) % MOD

But for m in 0 to k-1:

m +n can be up to (k-1) +n =n +k-1. The prefix_sum has length len(a)+1 = (n+k-1) +1 =n +k. So prefix_sum[m +n] is valid.

Yes.

So the code for S is:

S = [0]*k

for m in range(k):

    end = m +n

    if end > len(prefix_sum)-1:

        # shouldn't happen

        pass

    S[m] = (prefix_sum[end] - prefix_sum[m]) % MOD

Now, the combination table.

For example, when k=17, t can be up to 17, so t-1 is up to 16. So the combination table should be for t-1 up to 16. So the maximum m is 16.

So the code for comb:

max_comb = k-1  # since t-1 can be up to k-1 (when t=k)

comb = [[0]*(max_comb +1) for _ in range(max_comb +1)]

comb[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, max_comb +1):

    comb[i][0] = 1

    for j in range(1, i+1):

        comb[i][j] = (comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j]) % MOD

But for i in 1 to max_comb (16), and j up to i.

Now, precompute the pow_n_minus_1 up to k-1:

pow_n_minus_1 = [1]*(k)

for e in range(1, k):

    pow_n_minus_1[e] = pow_n_minus_1[e-1] * (n-1) % MOD

But pow_n_minus_1[0] is 1, then e runs from 1 to k-1.

Similarly, precompute pow_n up to k:

pow_n = [1]*(k+1)

for e in range(1, k+1):

    pow_n[e] = pow_n[e-1] * n % MOD

But wait, the exponents needed for n are k -t, where t ranges from 1 to k. So for t=1, exponent is k-1. For t=k, exponent is 0. So the precomputed pow_n for exponents up to k is needed.

Now, the main loop:

ans =0

for t in range(1, k+1):

    current_t_minus_1 = t-1

    for m in range(0, t):

        # compute C(t-1, m)

        current_comb = comb[current_t_minus_1][m]

        exponent_pow_n_minus_1 = current_t_minus_1 -m

        current_pow_n_minus_1 = pow_n_minus_1[exponent_pow_n_minus_1]

        # get S[m]

        if m >=k:

            # since m is up to t-1, and t is up to k, m can be up to k-1.

            # So m <k.

            # So no need for this check.

            current_S =0

        else:

            current_S = S[m]

        exponent_pow_n = k -t

        current_pow_n = pow_n[exponent_pow_n]

        term = current_comb * current_pow_n_minus_1 % MOD

        term = term * current_S % MOD

        term = term * current_pow_n % MOD

        ans = (ans + term) % MOD

return ans

But in Python, for m in range(0, t), when t is 1, m is 0. When t is 17 (k=17), m ranges 0..16.

But since m can be up to k-1=16, and S is precomputed for m up to k-1, all accesses to S[m] are valid.

So the code should work.

Testing with the first sample:

Input: 3 10 3 5 13 88

The array a is built for n=3, k=13.

Wait, the a array needs to be generated up to n +k -1 =3+13-1=15 elements? Or wait, n +k-1 is 3+13-1=15? So the a array has 15 elements. But for m up to k-1=12, and sum of n elements from m: m +n-1=12+3-1=14. Which is the 15th element (0-based). So the a array needs to be up to index 14 (15 elements).

But let's see the first sample's a array:

Initial a_0 is 10.

a_1 = (10 *3 +5) mod 88 =35 mod88=35.

a_2 = (35*3 +5)=110 mod88=22.

Then, the next elements are generated for i up to 3+13-1-1=15-1=14? Because the loop runs from 1 to n +k-1-1=15-1=14. So a has 15 elements.

So a_0=10, a_1=35, a_2=22, a_3=(22*3+5)=71 mod88=71, a_4= (71*3+5)=218 mod88=218-2*88=42, etc. But for the first sample, k=13 steps, and S[m] is sum of a[m] to a[m+2] for m up to 12.

But this is just an example, but the code should handle it.

Now, the code's steps for the first sample:

But in any case, the code should correctly compute the required sum.

Finally, the code must be written in Python, read from stdin, compute the answer, and print it.

So the final code would look like:

Read the input values.

Generate the a array.

Compute prefix sum.

Compute S[m].

Precompute combinations.

Precompute powers.

Compute the answer by iterating over t and m.

Now, handling all steps correctly.

Now, the code:

But there's one issue: when generating the a array, the first element is a0 mod M. So the code appends a0 % M as the first element.

Yes.

Now, check with an executable snippet:

```python
def test_program(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 998244353

    n, a0, x, y, k, M = map(int, input_stream.readline()[:-1].split())

    # Generate a array up to n + k - 2 (0-based index)
    a = [a0 % M]
    for i in range(1, n + k - 1):
        next_val = (a[-1] * x + y) % M
        a.append(next_val)

    # Compute prefix sums modulo MOD
