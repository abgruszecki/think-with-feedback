Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to make bets on football matches to maximize the profit. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that after the match, certain parameters become known, but during the betting phase, we only have some parameters. Wait, no. Wait, the input format for each match is given interactively. So during the betting phase, I think the model will have some features available before the match, and based on those, we have to predict the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY) to bet on. Then, after making the bet, the actual result is known, and points are calculated based on the bet and the coefficients.

The goal is to choose the best bet for each match to maximize the total points. Each correct bet gives (coef - 1) points, a wrong one gives -1, and skipping gives 0.

So the key is to predict the outcome of each match accurately and choose the bet with the highest expected value. But how do I model this?

Given that the training data is provided, I need to build a model that can predict the match outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY) based on the available features before the match. Then, for each match in the test set, using the model's prediction and the coefficients, decide which bet to place.

But first, what features are available at the time of betting? The problem statement says that the parameters known in advance are: division, time, home_team, away_team, referee, and the coefficients. The other parameters (like goals, shots, etc.) are known only after the match. So during betting, we only have the pre-match data.

Wait, looking at the input format example:

In the first example input line:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

Breaking down the input:

The problem says that each match is presented in an interactive format, but how exactly?

Wait, the input for each match is provided as lines. The problem's input example shows:

Each match's input consists of several lines. For example, the first test case's input has 3 matches, each with multiple lines. But I need to parse the input correctly.

Wait, the input for each match is given in some format. Let me check the example input again.

In the example input:

3
0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

0 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 -1 141 217 -1 1.714712084927 4.034616670416 5.587944088527

3 0 1 0 17 6 11 2 11 16 10 3 0 1 0 0
17 19:00 333 444 7 3.242665536417 3.714271486813 2.242156197892

2 4 1 0 7 12 4 8 11 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 0
...

But this seems a bit confusing. Maybe each match's input lines are split into two parts: before the match (the data available for betting) and after the match (the outcome data). But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says that during the interaction, the program has to make bets for each match. So for each match, the program is given some data (the pre-match features), then outputs the bet, then the actual result is given. But according to the input format, all n matches are given in the input, but how?

Wait, the problem's input format says that the first line is n, followed by n matches in an interactive format. But the example shows multiple lines. Perhaps each match is given as a line (or multiple lines) that contain the pre-match data, then after the program outputs the bet, the post-match data is provided. But the way the input is structured here isn't clear. However, the problem mentions that the solution must read from standard input and write to standard output. The example input shows a series of lines, and the output is three lines (DRAW, HOME, AWAY), so perhaps each match has some input lines that the program must process, then output a bet, and then proceed to the next match.

But this is unclear. However, perhaps the key is that for each match, the program is given some pre-match data (like division, time, home and away team, referee, coefficients) and needs to make a bet. Then, the post-match data (goals, shots, etc.) is given, but those are not used for betting, only for scoring.

Wait, the problem statement says that during the test phase, the matches are given in chronological order, and the program must process each one. The program's output is the bets for each match. The scoring is based on whether the bet was correct, and the coefficients.

So, during the testing phase, for each match, the program receives the pre-match data (the features known in advance) and must output the bet (HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or skip). Then, the program's score is calculated based on the actual outcome of the match.

But how is the actual outcome presented to the program? The problem's input format example includes lines that may represent the post-match data. But the output is just the bets, and the input after n is all the pre and post data for the matches.

Hmm, perhaps the input is structured as follows: For each match, two lines are given. The first line contains the pre-match data (division, time, home_team, away_team, referee, home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef). The second line contains the post-match data (goals, shots, etc.), but the program only needs to process the pre-match data to make the bet. The post-match data is used to compute the score, but the program doesn't need to read it for making the bet. Wait, but the program's output must be generated for each match before seeing the post data. So the input may have all the pre and post data for all matches, but the program must process each match's pre data, output the bet, and then proceed.

But how exactly is the input structured? The example input has lines that include some numbers. Let me look at the example input again:

The first line is 3, indicating n=3. Then for each match:

The first match's input lines:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

0 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Hmm, the first line of a match may be the pre-match data, and the second line the post. But the program only needs to read the pre data to make the bet. Then, the post data is used to compute the score. So the program must read the pre-data for a match, output the bet, and then read the post-data (but not use it for anything else except possibly for training if there's online learning, but in the problem statement, the training data is given in the CSV file, and the test data is separate. So during the testing phase, the program can't use the test's post-data to adjust the model. So the post-data in the input is irrelevant for the betting decision; it's just there to calculate the score after the fact.

Wait, but during the test phase, the program is given the input which includes all the pre and post data for each match. However, the program must output the bet for each match based only on the pre data of that match, and the post data is provided after the program has made the bet.

So the input for each match would have the pre data line, then the program outputs the bet, then the post data line(s), which the program may read but does not use for subsequent bets. However, since the matches are in chronological order, the program can use past matches' data (if any) for future predictions. But in the problem statement, the training data is given, so perhaps during testing, the program can't use the test matches' post-data (as they come after the bet is made). So the program can only use the pre data of each match to make the bet. The post data is provided, but after the bet has been made.

So for each match, the program must first read the pre data line, then output the bet, then read the post data line. Then proceed to the next match.

But how is this structured in the input?

In the example input, the first line after n=3 is:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

Which seems to be the pre data. Then the next line is:

0 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Which is the post data. Then another match starts with a line:

1 -1 141 217 -1 1.714712084927 4.034616670416 5.587944088527

Which is pre data, then output AWAY? Then next line is the post data, etc.

So the program must process each match by:

1. Read the pre data line for the match.

2. Decide the bet (HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or skip) and output it.

3. Read the post data line (which is not used for betting decisions).

So the input for n matches will consist of 2n lines: for each match, one pre and one post line.

Thus, the program must read these lines accordingly.

Now, the problem is to build a model that uses the pre data of each match to predict the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY), and then choose the best bet based on the coefficients to maximize the expected points.

So the approach would be:

- Train a machine learning model using the training data (train.csv) to predict the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY) based on the pre-match features.

- For each test match, use the model to predict the probability of each outcome, then compute the expected value of betting on each option. The expected value for betting on HOME is (prob_HOME * (home_coef - 1)) + (1 - prob_HOME) * (-1). Similarly for DRAW and AWAY.

- Choose the option (HOME, DRAW, AWAY) with the highest expected value. If all options have negative expected value, skip the bet (output nothing or something else? Wait, the output is to print HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or skip. Wait, the output format shows examples where they printed 'DRAW', 'HOME', 'AWAY'. So the possible outputs are those three options. But according to the problem statement, if you skip a bet, you get 0 points. So how is the skip represented? The note says, "if you skip a bet, you receive 0 points. Otherwise, your bet is won and you get Î±-1...". So the output for skipping is not printing anything. But according to the example output, they print three lines. So for each match, the program must output one of HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or nothing (which counts as a skip). But the example shows three outputs for three matches. So perhaps for each match, you must output exactly one line (either HOME, DRAW, AWAY) or nothing to skip. But the example outputs three lines, indicating that each match is bet on.

So the model's approach is:

For each test match, given the pre data (division, time, home_team, away_team, referee, home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef), we need to decide which of the three options to bet on, or skip.

But how to model this.

So first, we need to process the training data to build a model that predicts the outcome (full_time_home_goals vs full_time_away_goals) to determine HOME, DRAW, or AWAY.

In the training data, the target variable is the outcome, which can be derived from full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals. For example, if home_goals > away_goals, it's HOME. If equal, DRAW. Else AWAY.

So, the first step is to preprocess the training data to create the target variable.

Then, using the pre-match features (division, home_team, away_team, referee, home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef, time), build a model that can predict the probability of each outcome.

But which features are available in the test matches? From the problem statement's input example, each pre data line seems to have:

For example, the first line of a match in the example input is:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

Breaking down the numbers:

Assuming that the pre data line includes:

- Division (0)

- Time (maybe -1 here, but the problem says the Time field may be empty. But how is that represented here?)

Wait, looking at the problem statement's description of the training data fields:

The pre-match features in the training data include Division, Time, home_team, away_team, Referee, home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

But in the input format for each match's pre data line, how are these fields presented?

Looking at the example input line:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

Assuming this represents:

Division is 0.

Time is -1 (but the Time field in the training data is in HH:MM format. So maybe in the input, the Time is represented as a string, but in the example input, this line has a -1. Wait, perhaps the Time is given as a string, but how is this parsed? Hmm, perhaps the input line for the pre data is structured as follows:

The pre data line has the following fields:

Division (int), Time (string?), home_team (int), away_team (int), Referee (int), home_coef (float), draw_coef (float), away_coef (float).

But in the example input line, the fields are 0, -1, 152, 426, 1, 3.627..., 3.577..., 2.198...

So Division is 0.

Time is -1 (which could mean missing, as per the problem statement where the Time field may be empty).

home_team is 152.

away_team is 426.

Referee is 1.

Then home_coef is 3.627..., draw_coef 3.577..., away_coef 2.198...

But how is Time represented in the input? The problem says that in the training data, Time is in HH:MM format. But in the input for the test matches, how is the Time given? As a string like "19:00" or as some encoded value?

Looking at the example input's third match:

17 19:00 333 444 7 3.242665536417 3.714271486813 2.242156197892

So here, Division is 17, Time is "19:00", home_team 333, away_team 444, referee 7, and the coefficients.

So the input for the pre data line is:

Division (int), Time (string, possibly -1 if missing), home_team (int), away_team (int), Referee (int, -1 if missing), home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

So the input line for each pre data is:

division time home_team away_team referee home_coef draw_coef away_coef

So when reading each pre data line, the first entry is division (int), then time (string, possibly "-1"), then home_team (int), away_team (int), referee (int, could be -1), followed by the three coefficients.

So for processing, the features available for the model are:

- division: categorical (integer, but could be treated as a category or a numerical feature)

- time: possibly parsed into hour and minute, or treated as a string. If time is "-1", it's missing.

- home_team and away_team: categorical variables (team IDs). Since teams can be numerous, one-hot encoding may not be feasible. Alternative is to use embeddings, but for a model that's efficient, perhaps using mean encoding (like target encoding) based on historical performance.

- referee: categorical variable (again, possible to use target encoding if needed).

- coefficients: home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef. These are important features as they reflect the bookmaker's odds, which are predictive of the outcome.

So the features available are division, time, home_team, away_team, referee, and the coefficients.

In the training data, the outcome (target variable) is determined by full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals.

The problem is a multiclass classification (HOME, DRAW, AWAY).

The challenge is to build a model that, given these features, can predict the probabilities of each outcome. Then, using these probabilities and the coefficients, compute the expected value for each possible bet and choose the one with the highest expected value. If all expected values are negative, we skip the bet.

But how to compute expected value:

For example, if the model predicts probabilities pH, pD, pA for HOME, DRAW, AWAY respectively.

The expected value (EV) for betting on HOME is:

EV_H = pH * (home_coef - 1) + (1 - pH) * (-1) 

Similarly for EV_D and EV_A.

We can compute each EV and choose the maximum. If the maximum EV is positive, bet on that outcome; otherwise, skip.

But how accurate this model is depends on how well the probabilities are predicted.

So the key steps are:

1. Preprocess the training data to extract features and create the target variable.

2. Train a model to predict the probabilities of each outcome.

3. For test matches, use the model to predict probabilities, compute EVs, and choose the best bet.

Now, considering the constraints:

- Time limit per test: 60 seconds. So for n=8500, the code must process each match quickly. But since the model is pre-trained (during the code's initialization), the per-match processing should be fast.

- Memory limit: 512 MB. So the model can't be too large. However, with Python libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc., it's manageable.

So the plan is:

- Use the training data to train a model (like XGBoost or LightGBM) that predicts outcome probabilities.

- For each test match, input the pre data, extract features, use the model to get probabilities, compute EVs, and choose the best bet.

But how to handle the pre-processing steps for the test data?

First, the features in the training data:

Division: categorical. Need to encode, perhaps as one-hot (if few categories) or leave as ordinal (if many).

Time: parse into hour and minute. For example, if the time is "19:00", then hour is 19, minute is 0. If time is missing, maybe treat as a separate category or use 0,0.

home_team and away_team: categorical variables. Since there could be many teams, one-hot is not feasible. So use target encoding (mean of the target variable for each team's past matches) or use embeddings. But during training, for each team, calculate historical performance (like the average outcome when they are home or away). Alternatively, use a model that can handle high-cardinality categorical variables, like LightGBM, which can handle categorical features with proper encoding.

Referee: similar to teams, but again, many possible values. So target encoding or use the model's handling.

The coefficients (home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef) are numerical features. They are likely very predictive, as they are the bookmakers' odds.

So for feature engineering:

- Convert time into hour and minute as numerical features. Missing time can be represented with a flag (like is_time_missing) and default values for hour and minute.

- For home_team and away_team, compute historical features. For example, for each team, when playing home, compute the win rate, average goals scored, etc. Similarly for away. But this requires aggregating historical data, which may be tricky as the test matches are processed in chronological order. However, during training, all data is available. So during training, we can compute for each team's historical performance up to the current match. But in the problem's setup, when processing test matches, we can't use future data. So the model must not include features that require future information. Therefore, any historical features must be computed in a way that only uses data from matches before the current one.

But given that the training data is provided as a CSV file, which includes all matches, we can precompute for each match in the training data the historical features of the home and away teams up to that point in time. Then, when building the model, use these features. For example, for each match, compute the home_team's average goals per home match up to that point, the number of home wins, etc. Similarly for the away_team.

However, this would require processing the training data in chronological order, which may be time-consuming, but manageable.

Alternatively, use the team's past performance in the training data to create aggregated features. For example, in the training data, for each team, calculate the number of times they have been home and won, drawn, lost. Similarly for away. Then, for each test match, use these aggregated values up to the time of the match (i.e., not including future matches). But how is this possible if the test data is separate? Because during training, the model is built using the training data, and during testing, the test data comes in chronological order. So for each test match, we can track the home and away team's historical performance (from training and previous test matches) to compute their features.

But this complicates the model, as the code would need to maintain state during the test phase. For example, when a test match's home_team is 333, and we've seen this team in the training data, we can use their historical stats from the training data. Then, if during testing, they appear again, we can update their stats based on the test matches that have already been processed.

But this approach requires that during testing, the code keeps track of the historical performance of each team, referee, etc., which could add to the computational overhead. However, given that n is up to 8500, this is manageable.

Alternatively, for the test phase, the code can't use any information from the test matches (since they are in the future), and thus can only use the training data's aggregated features. But this might not capture the test teams' performance if they are not present in the training data. For example, a new team in the test data would have no historical data, but the model would need to handle that.

So perhaps the approach is to precompute for each team in the training data their historical performance (home and away) and use that as features, along with the bookmaker's coefficients. For test matches where the teams are new (not present in the training data), use default values (like 0 or average) for these features.

But this might not be optimal. However, given time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to focus on the coefficients, as they are highly predictive. Bookmakers' odds are usually efficient, so the coefficients may already encapsulate most of the predictive power. So a model that primarily uses the coefficients could be sufficient.

Another approach is to use the implied probabilities from the coefficients. Bookmakers' odds can be converted into implied probabilities (after adjusting for the overround). The implied probabilities may be good predictors of the actual outcomes.

So perhaps the model can use the inverse of the coefficients (adjusted for overround) as features. For example, home_implied = 1 / home_coef, etc. Then, compare these to the model's predicted probabilities.

But the model can directly use the coefficients as features, as they are.

So, to proceed:

Features for the model:

- home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

- division (categorical).

- time (parsed into hour and minute, or handled as a string).

- home_team and away_team's historical performance in the training data (e.g., home_team's home win rate, away_team's away win rate).

- referee's historical stats (e.g., average home win rate when this referee is present).

But for home_team and away_team, we can compute the following for each team in the training data:

For home_team:

- Number of home matches played.

- Home win rate (number of home wins / home matches).

- Home draw rate.

- Average goals scored at home.

- Average goals conceded at home.

Similarly for away_team:

- Number of away matches played.

- Away win rate.

- Away draw rate.

- Average goals scored away.

- Average goals conceded away.

These features can be added to the model.

But how to compute them for the training data. For each row in the training data, we need to compute the historical stats up to that match. So, the code would process the training data in chronological order, maintaining a dictionary for each team's home and away stats as they accumulate.

Then, for each training example, the features are computed based on the stats up to that point.

But the problem states that the training data is provided as a CSV file. So during the code's preprocessing phase, it can read the training data, sort it by time (assuming that the rows are in chronological order), and then compute rolling features for each team.

However, the training data may not be sorted in chronological order. The 'Time' field is in HH:MM format, but the problem statement says that the test matches are given in chronological order. The training data's matches may not be in order. So how to process them?

Assuming that the training data is in chronological order (since the problem says that the test matches are in chronological order), but if the training data is not sorted, then this approach may not work. However, the code can't know the actual dates of the matches, as the 'Time' field only has HH:MM and not the date. So perhaps the training data is not ordered, and thus this approach is not feasible.

Alternatively, the code can ignore the order and compute overall averages for each team. But this would not be accurate, as historical performance should be up to the current match, not including future matches.

This seems complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use the coefficients and division as features, along with time parsed into hour. Because the bookmaker's odds are likely the strongest predictors.

So the model's features would be:

- home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

- division (one-hot encoded).

- hour (from Time, if available; else, missing indicator).

- referee (if available, else -1).

But in the training data, the referee can be -1 (missing), so need to handle that.

Alternatively, drop the time and referee features if they are not available. Or, engineer features from them.

But how to parse the Time string. For example, if the time is '19:00', then the hour is 19. Could this be a feature? Perhaps matches in the evening have different outcomes than in the afternoon. So parse the time into hour as a numerical feature, and minute as another. Or, create a 'part of day' feature (morning, afternoon, evening, night). For example, 0-5: night, 6-11: morning, 12-17: afternoon, 18-23: evening. Or similar.

Alternatively, use sine and cosine transformations for the hour to capture cyclical patterns.

But given time constraints, perhaps just use the hour as a numerical feature, with missing values replaced by the mean.

But handling missing values is also important. For example, if Time is missing (-1), we can impute it with the average hour of the training data, or treat it as a separate category.

But given that the problem's example input includes Time as '19:00', and other examples with -1, perhaps the code can parse the time into hour and minute, and for missing times, set hour and minute to -1, and then treat them as separate categories.

But how to handle this in the model.

For example, for the time feature:

- If the time is present (not -1), split into hour and minute.

- Else, create two features: hour (-1) and minute (-1).

Then, during preprocessing, scale these features or encode them as categorical variables.

Alternatively, create a binary feature indicating whether the time is missing.

So the code would parse the Time field from the pre data line. For each pre data line:

If Time is '-1', then time is missing. Else, split into hour and minute.

So for each match, the code extracts:

- division (int)

- time_missing (bool: 1 if time is -1, else 0)

- hour (int, if time is present)

- minute (int, if time is present)

- home_team (int)

- away_team (int)

- referee (int, -1 if missing)

- home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef (floats)

Now, for home_team and away_team, perhaps use target encoding based on their historical performance in the training data.

For example, compute for home_team their historical home win rate, home draw rate, average goals scored when home, etc. Similarly for away_team when away.

But how to do this in practice.

First, in the training data, for each team, compute:

- home_stats: count of home matches, home wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded.

- away_stats: count of away matches, away wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded.

For each row in the training data, which is a match, we can compute these stats up to that match (i.e., not including future matches).

But since the training data is a CSV, the code needs to process each row in chronological order. However, the problem states that the training data is available, but the code can't use any third-party datasets. So the code must read the training data (train.csv) during its preprocessing phase.

Assuming that the training data is in chronological order (but the problem statement doesn't say that), the code can process each row, and for each team, update their home and away stats.

But if the training data is not sorted, this approach would not work. So perhaps the code needs to sort the training data by time before processing.

But the Time field is in HH:MM format, and the dates are not known. So it's impossible to sort the training data chronologically. Therefore, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: assume that all matches in the training data are before the test matches. So for the test matches, when computing a team's historical stats, use all matches in the training data (regardless of order), and any previous test matches processed so far.

But this may not be accurate, but it's the best we can do.

Alternatively, compute global averages for each team's home and away performance from the training data. For example, home_team's overall home win rate in the training data. If a team is new (not in training data), use the overall average.

But this way, the features are static and based on the entire training data, not just past matches. This could introduce data leakage but since the training data is used to build the model, and the test data is processed in chronological order, this might not be a problem. However, in reality, the test matches may happen after the training matches, so using the entire training data for historical stats is acceptable.

So the steps would be:

1. Read the training data (train.csv).

2. Preprocess the training data:

   a. For each match, compute the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY) based on full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals.

   b. For each team, compute their home and away statistics (e.g., home win rate, away win rate, average goals, etc.) based on all matches in the training data where they were home/away.

   c. For each referee, compute their historical stats (e.g., average home win rate when they are the referee).

3. For each match in the training data, create features based on:

   - division

   - time (parsed into hour and minute)

   - home_team's historical home stats

   - away_team's historical away stats

   - referee's historical stats

   - home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef

4. Train a model (like XGBoost) to predict the outcome probabilities.

5. For test matches:

   a. For each test match's pre data line, extract the features:

      - division

      - time (parse into hour and minute, or set to missing)

      - home_team and away_team's historical stats (from training data or previous test matches)

      - referee's stats (from training data)

      - home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

   b. Use the model to predict pH, pD, pA.

   c. Compute the expected values for each bet:

      EV_H = pH * (home_coef - 1) + (1 - pH) * (-1)

      Similarly for EV_D and EV_A.

   d. Choose the bet with the maximum EV. If the maximum EV is positive, output that bet; otherwise, skip.

But in the test matches, how do we track the home_team and away_team's stats from previous test matches? Because if a team plays multiple times in the test data, their historical stats (from test matches) should be included when processing later test matches.

So during testing, the code must maintain a data structure to track each team's home and away performance in the test matches that have been processed so far.

But this is feasible. For example:

- Keep a dictionary for home_stats and away_stats for each team.

- When processing a test match, after making the bet and before moving to the next match, update the home_team's home stats and the away_team's away stats based on the outcome of the current match.

But how to get the outcome of the current test match? Because the post data is read after the bet is made, and contains the full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals.

So the code's steps for each test match would be:

1. Read the pre data line.

2. Extract features using the current state of team stats (from training data and previous test matches).

3. Use the model to predict probabilities.

4. Compute EVs and make a bet.

5. Output the bet.

6. Read the post data line.

7. Update the home_team's home stats and away_team's away stats with the outcome of this match.

But this requires that the code can process the post data line to get the home and away goals, which determine the outcome. Then, the code can update the team's stats accordingly.

But how to parse the post data line. Let's look at the example input.

For the first match's post data line:

0 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

But according to the problem statement, the post data includes:

full_time_home_goals, full_time_away_goals, etc. But the post data line seems to have 16 numbers. Let's check the fields:

Looking back at the problem statement, the post data includes:

full_time_home_goals, full_time_away_goals, half_time_home_goals, half_time_away_goals, Referee, home_shots, away_shots, home_shots_on_target, away_shots_on_target, home_fouls, away_fouls, home_corners, away_corners, home_yellow_cards, away_yellow_cards, home_red_cards, away_red_cards.

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

The problem statement says after the match, the following parameters become known:

the number of teams' goals in the first half and for the entire time of the match, the number of teams' shots (attempts), shots on target, corners, yellow and red cards.

So the post data line includes:

full_time_home_goals, full_time_away_goals, half_time_home_goals, half_time_away_goals, home_shots, away_shots, home_shots_on_target, away_shots_on_target, home_fouls, away_fouls, home_corners, away_corners, home_yellow_cards, away_yellow_cards, home_red_cards, away_red_cards.

Wait, but the problem statement says:

After the match, the following parameters become known: the number of goals in first half and entire match, shots, shots on target, corners, yellow and red cards.

So the post data line would have:

full_time_home_goals, full_time_away_goals,

half_time_home_goals, half_time_away_goals,

home_shots, away_shots,

home_shots_on_target, away_shots_on_target,

home_fouls, away_fouls,

home_corners, away_corners,

home_yellow_cards, away_yellow_cards,

home_red_cards, away_red_cards.

But the example's first post data line is:

0 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

This has 16 values. Let's count:

1. full_time_home_goals (0)

2. full_time_away_goals (0)

3. half_time_home_goals (0)

4. half_time_away_goals (0)

5. home_shots (-1)

6. away_shots (-1)

7. home_shots_on_target (-1)

8. away_shots_on_target (-1)

9. home_fouls (-1)

10. away_fouls (-1)

11. home_corners (-1)

12. away_corners (-1)

13. home_yellow_cards (-1)

14. away_yellow_cards (-1)

15. home_red_cards (-1)

16. away_red_cards (-1)

So the post data line has 16 values, but many are -1, indicating missing data.

The code needs to parse the first two (full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals) to determine the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY). The other fields may not be needed.

So for updating the team's stats in the test phase, the code reads the post data line, parses the first two integers (full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals) to determine the outcome, then updates the home_team's home stats and away_team's away stats.

Thus, the code can maintain dictionaries for home_stats and away_stats, which track for each team:

home_stats[team_id] = {
    'matches': total home matches played,
    'wins': number of home wins,
    'draws': number of home draws,
    'losses': number of home losses,
    'goals_scored': total goals scored at home,
    'goals_conceded': total goals conceded at home,
}

Similarly for away_stats.

During training, these stats are computed from the training data. During testing, after each match's post data is processed, the home_team's home_stats and away_team's away_stats are updated.

But for the test phase, the initial home_stats and away_stats are based on the training data. Then, as each test match is processed, their stats are updated.

So the steps for the code:

1. Read the training data (train.csv) and process it to compute the initial home_stats and away_stats for each team, as well as referee_stats.

   a. For each row in train.csv:

      i. Determine the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY).

      ii. Update the home_team's home_stats and the away_team's away_stats.

      iii. Update the referee's stats (if referee is present).

2. Train a model using the features derived from division, time, home_team's home_stats, away_team's away_stats, referee's stats, and the coefficients.

3. For test matches:

   a. Read the pre data line.

   b. Extract features:

      - division.

      - time: parsed into hour and minute (or marked as missing).

      - home_team's home_stats (from training data + previous test matches).

      - away_team's away_stats (from training data + previous test matches).

      - referee's stats (from training data).

      - home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

   c. Use the model to predict probabilities pH, pD, pA.

   d. Compute expected values for each bet.

   e. Choose the best bet (max EV) if it's positive; otherwise, skip.

   f. Output the bet.

   g. Read the post data line.

   h. Update home_team's home_stats and away_team's away_stats based on the outcome.

But implementing this requires:

- Efficient data structures to track the stats for each team.

- Efficient parsing of the training data.

- Efficient model training and prediction.

Now, considering the allowed Python libraries, which include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc., the code can use pandas to read the training data and process it.

So the code structure would be:

- Read train.csv into a pandas DataFrame.

- Preprocess the data: compute the outcome (HOME, DRAW, AWAY).

- Compute for each team and referee their historical stats.

- Extract features for the training data.

- Train a model (like XGBoost or LightGBM) on these features.

- For the test phase:

   For each test match:

   - Read pre data line.

   - Extract features (using the model's preprocessing steps).

   - Predict probabilities.

   - Compute EVs and make a decision.

   - Output the bet.

   - Read post data line.

   - Update home_stats and away_stats for the teams.

But how to handle new teams in test data that are not present in the training data. For such teams, their home_stats and away_stats would be initialized to 0, and during the test phase, they will accumulate stats as matches are processed.

So during the code's initialization:

- home_stats and away_stats are defaultdicts that default to zero counts.

For example, home_stats could be a defaultdict that, when a team is not found, returns a default dictionary with 'matches' = 0, 'wins' = 0, etc.

But in Python, using defaultdict with a default factory function to create nested dictionaries.

Alternatively, for each team, check if they exist in the home_stats; if not, use default values (e.g., 0 for all counts).

So during training, the code would process each row in the training data and update home_stats and away_stats.

Then, during testing, when a test match's home_team is processed, their home_stats are looked up, and if not present, default to zero.

But this is okay, as new teams in the test data would start with zero stats, and their stats would be updated as the test matches are processed.

Now, the code:

First, read the training data.

But the problem says that the training data is available via a specific URL. However, the code must not use any other datasets. So the code must read the training data from the given URL.

But during the contest, the code is run in an environment where the training data is provided. However, the user's note says that the training data is available via the link, and the code must read it.

But for the solution to be self-contained, perhaps the code will read the training data from the URL using urllib or requests. However, the problem's note says that during the contest, the solution will be tested on a new dataset, and the code must be submitted with all necessary parts.

But for the problem's solution, perhaps the code can read the training data from the provided URL, preprocess it, and build the model.

But during the contest, the code may not have access to the internet. So perhaps the training data is provided as part of the problem's files. But this is unclear. The problem statement says that using any other datasets is prohibited, but the code is allowed to use the provided training data.

Assuming that the code can read the training data from the URL, the code will download it, process it, and build the model.

But in practice, during the contest, the code may be allowed to include the training data as a file in the submission. But given the size of the CSV file (which may be large), this may not be feasible.

Alternatively, the code can read the training data from the given URL during runtime.

So the code starts by downloading the training data from the URL, then processing it.

But how to handle this in Python:

Using urllib.request to download the CSV file.

For example:

import urllib.request

url = 'http://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1522/3056cab52876d3327edafe4771c8589a96cb1a93/train.csv'

response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
data = response.read().decode('utf-8')

Then, read the data into a pandas DataFrame.

But this requires an internet connection, which may not be available during the contest's testing phase. However, the problem's note says that the training data is provided via the link, and using other datasets is prohibited. So it's assumed that the code is allowed to download this data during runtime.

But if the testing environment does not have internet access, this approach would fail. So perhaps the training data is provided as a file in the submission. However, the problem states that the training data is available by the link, but the code must not use any other datasets. So during the contest, the code must download the training data from the provided URL.

But in the problem's submission, perhaps the code is allowed to read the training data from this URL. However, during the final testing, the code will be re-tested on a new dataset. So the code must be able to download the training data during runtime.

Assuming that the code has internet access during runtime, the code can proceed.

So steps for the code:

1. Download the training data from the given URL.

2. Read it into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Preprocess the data:

   a. Convert the 'full_time_home_goals' and 'full_time_away_goals' into the target variable (HOME, DRAW, AWAY).

   b. For each row, parse the Time into hour and minute, or mark as missing.

   c. For each home_team and away_team, compute their historical home and away stats up to that point.

   d. For each referee, compute their historical stats.

   e. Extract features such as home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef, division, hour, etc.

But step 3c is challenging, as the code must process the training data in chronological order to compute the historical stats up to each match. But the training data's matches may not be sorted in chronological order.

This is a problem. How to handle it?

The problem is that to compute the historical stats for each match, the code needs to process all previous matches. But if the training data is not sorted, this is impossible.

But the code can't know the actual dates of the matches. The 'Time' field is in HH:MM format, but without dates, it's impossible to determine the chronological order.

Thus, the code has to assume that the training data's matches are in chronological order. So the code processes the training data in the order they appear in the CSV file, assuming that this order is chronological.

But this is a big assumption, and may not be valid. However, given the problem constraints, this may be the only feasible approach.

So proceed under this assumption.

Thus, the code reads the training data in the order provided, and for each row, updates the home_team's home_stats and away_team's away_stats.

Now, let's outline the code.

First, download the training data and read it into a DataFrame:

import pandas as pd
import urllib.request

url = 'http://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1522/3056cab52876d3327edafe4771c8589a96cb1a93/train.csv'
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
df = pd.read_csv(response)

Then, process each row to compute the target variable:

df['outcome'] = df.apply(lambda row: 
    'HOME' if row['full_time_home_goals'] > row['full_time_away_goals'] 
    else 'DRAW' if row['full_time_home_goals'] == row['full_time_away_goals'] 
    else 'AWAY', axis=1)

Next, initialize dictionaries to track home_stats and away_stats for each team:

from collections import defaultdict

home_stats = defaultdict(lambda: {'matches': 0, 'wins': 0, 'draws': 0, 'losses': 0, 'goals_scored': 0, 'goals_conceded': 0})
away_stats = defaultdict(lambda: {'matches': 0, 'wins': 0, 'draws': 0, 'losses': 0, 'goals_scored': 0, 'goals_conceded': 0})

referee_stats = defaultdict(lambda: {'matches': 0, 'home_wins': 0, 'draws': 0, 'away_wins': 0})

Then, iterate over each row in the training data to populate these stats:

for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    home = row['home_team']
    away = row['away_team']
    outcome = row['outcome']
    full_time_home_goals = row['full_time_home_goals']
    full_time_away_goals = row['full_time_away_goals']
    referee = row['Referee']

    # Update home team's home stats
    home_stats[home]['matches'] += 1
    home_stats[home]['goals_scored'] += full_time_home_goals
    home_stats[home]['goals_conceded'] += full_time_away_goals
    if outcome == 'HOME':
        home_stats[home]['wins'] += 1
    elif outcome == 'DRAW':
        home_stats[home]['draws'] += 1
    else:
        home_stats[home]['losses'] += 1

    # Update away team's away stats
    away_stats[away]['matches'] += 1
    away_stats[away]['goals_scored'] += full_time_away_goals
    away_stats[away]['goals_conceded'] += full_time_home_goals
    if outcome == 'AWAY':
        away_stats[away]['wins'] += 1
    elif outcome == 'DRAW':
        away_stats[away]['draws'] += 1
    else:
        away_stats[away]['losses'] += 1

    # Update referee stats
    if referee != -1:
        referee_stats[referee]['matches'] += 1
        if outcome == 'HOME':
            referee_stats[referee]['home_wins'] += 1
        elif outcome == 'DRAW':
            referee_stats[referee]['draws'] += 1
        else:
            referee_stats[referee]['away_wins'] += 1

Now, for each row in the training data, compute features based on the current state of home_stats and away_stats before processing the row. But since we are processing the rows in order, when we update home_stats and away_stats, the next row's features would be based on previous matches. But this would not be correct for the current row, as the current row's features should not include itself. Thus, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, no. The code is iterating over each row in the training data, and updating the home_stats and away_stats after processing each row. Thus, when processing row i, the home_stats and away_stats include all previous rows (0 to i-1), and the current row's features are based on those stats.

But the current row's outcome is part of the training data and is used to update the stats, but the features for the current row should not include its own outcome.

Thus, this approach is incorrect. The features for a row should be based on the stats up to but not including that row.

But when processing row i, the home_stats and away_stats are updated after processing row i-1, so when processing row i, the stats are up to i-1. Then, after processing row i, the stats are updated to include row i.

But this requires that the code first computes the features for the row using the current stats (which include up to i-1), then updates the stats with row i's data.

Thus, the correct approach is:

For each row in the training data:

1. Compute the features based on the current home_stats and away_stats (which include all previous rows).

2. Update home_stats and away_stats with the current row's data.

Thus, the code must compute the features first, then update the stats.

But this requires that during the feature extraction phase, the code processes each row, computes the features based on the current stats, then updates the stats.

But in the current code structure, the stats are updated while iterating over the rows, so the features for row i are computed based on the stats after processing rows 0 to i-1.

Thus, this is correct.

But to capture these features for model training, the code must create a list of features for each row, which requires processing the training data and building a feature matrix.

Thus, the code needs to loop through the training data, for each row:

- Extract features based on the current stats.

- Update the stats.

But during this process, the features for each row are stored for training the model.

So the code needs to collect features for each row.

Let's modify the code:

features = []
targets = []

for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    home = row['home_team']
    away = row['away_team']
    referee = row['Referee']
    home_coef = row['home_coef']
    draw_coef = row['draw_coef']
    away_coef = row['away_coef']
    division = row['Division']
    time_str = row['Time']
    
    # Parse time
    if pd.isna(time_str) or time_str == '-1':
        hour = -1
        minute = -1
    else:
        try:
            hour, minute = map(int, time_str.split(':'))
        except:
            hour = -1
            minute = -1
    
    # Get home team's home stats
    home_info = home_stats[home]
    home_matches = home_info['matches']
    home_win_rate = home_info['wins'] / home_matches if home_matches > 0 else 0.0
    home_draw_rate = home_info['draws'] / home_matches if home_matches > 0 else 0.0
    home_loss_rate = home_info['losses'] / home_matches if home_matches > 0 else 0.0
    home_avg_goals_scored = home_info['goals_scored'] / home_matches if home_matches > 0 else 0.0
    home_avg_goals_conceded = home_info['goals_conceded'] / home_matches if home_matches > 0 else 0.0
    
    # Get away team's away stats
    away_info = away_stats[away]
    away_matches = away_info['matches']
    away_win_rate = away_info['wins'] / away_matches if away_matches > 0 else 0.0
    away_draw_rate = away_info['draws'] / away_matches if away_matches > 0 else 0.0
    away_loss_rate = away_info['losses'] / away_matches if away_matches > 0 else 0.0
    away_avg_goals_scored = away_info['goals_scored'] / away_matches if away_matches > 0 else 0.0
    away_avg_goals_conceded = away_info['goals_conceded'] / away_matches if away_matches > 0 else 0.0
    
    # Get referee stats
    if referee == -1:
        ref_home_win_rate = 0.0
        ref_draw_rate = 0.0
        ref_away_win_rate = 0.0
    else:
        ref_info = referee_stats[referee]
        ref_matches = ref_info['matches']
        ref_home_win_rate = ref_info['home_wins'] / ref_matches if ref_matches > 0 else 0.0
        ref_draw_rate = ref_info['draws'] / ref_matches if ref_matches > 0 else 0.0
        ref_away_win_rate = ref_info['away_wins'] / ref_matches if ref_matches > 0 else 0.0
    
    # Create feature vector
    feature = [
        division,
        hour,
        minute,
        home_coef,
        draw_coef,
        away_coef,
        home_win_rate,
        home_draw_rate,
        home_loss_rate,
        home_avg_goals_scored,
        home_avg_goals_conceded,
        away_win_rate,
        away_draw_rate,
        away_loss_rate,
        away_avg_goals_scored,
        away_avg_goals_conceded,
        ref_home_win_rate,
        ref_draw_rate,
        ref_away_win_rate,
    ]
    
    features.append(feature)
    targets.append(row['outcome'])
    
    # Now update the stats with this row's data
    outcome = 'HOME' if row['full_time_home_goals'] > row['full_time_away_goals'] else 'DRAW' if row['full_time_home_goals'] == row['full_time_away_goals'] else 'AWAY'
    full_time_home_goals = row['full_time_home_goals']
    full_time_away_goals = row['full_time_away_goals']
    
    # Update home team's home stats
    home_stats[home]['matches'] += 1
    home_stats[home]['goals_scored'] += full_time_home_goals
    home_stats[home]['goals_conceded'] += full_time_away_goals
    if outcome == 'HOME':
        home_stats[home]['wins'] += 1
    elif outcome == 'DRAW':
        home_stats[home]['draws'] += 1
    else:
        home_stats[home]['losses'] += 1
    
    # Update away team's away stats
    away_stats[away]['matches'] += 1
    away_stats[away]['goals_scored'] += full_time_away_goals
    away_stats[away]['goals_conceded'] += full_time_home_goals
    if outcome == 'AWAY':
        away_stats[away]['wins'] += 1
    elif outcome == 'DRAW':
        away_stats[away]['draws'] += 1
    else:
        away_stats[away]['losses'] += 1
    
    # Update referee stats
    if referee != -1:
        referee_stats[referee]['matches'] += 1
        if outcome == 'HOME':
            referee_stats[referee]['home_wins'] += 1
        elif outcome == 'DRAW':
            referee_stats[referee]['draws'] += 1
        else:
            referee_stats[referee]['away_wins'] += 1

Now, the features list contains the feature vectors for each row, and targets list contains the outcomes.

Once this is done, the code can proceed to train a model.

For example, using XGBoost's XGBClassifier:

from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Encode the target variable
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(targets)

# Convert features to a numpy array
import numpy as np
X = np.array(features)

# Train the model
model = XGBClassifier(objective='multi:softprob', n_estimators=200, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1)
model.fit(X, y)

Once the model is trained, during the test phase, for each test match:

Read the pre data line, extract the features, predict the probabilities, compute the EVs, and decide the bet.

But during the test phase, the code must also track the home_stats and away_stats as test matches are processed.

So the code will have the home_stats and away_stats dictionaries, which already include the training data's stats. Then, for each test match:

1. Read the pre data line.

2. Parse the division, time, home_team, away_team, referee, home_coef, draw_coef, away_coef.

3. Extract features based on the current home_stats and away_stats for the teams.

4. Use the model to predict probabilities.

5. Compute the EVs.

6. Output the best bet.

7. Read the post data line.

8. Update home_stats and away_stats based on the post data's full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals.

So the code must read the post data line to get the goals and update the stats.

But how to parse the pre data line and post data line.

The pre data line for each match has the following fields:

division (int), time (string), home_team (int), away_team (int), referee (int), home_coef (float), draw_coef (float), away_coef (float).

But in the example input lines, the pre data line has eight values. For example:

0 -1 152 426 1 3.627689584601 3.577721408504 2.198599748243

So the fields are:

division = 0

time = '-1'

home_team = 152

away_team = 426

referee = 1

home_coef = 3.627689584601

draw_coef = 3.577721408504

away_coef = 2.198599748243

Thus, the code can split the line into these eight components.

Similarly, the post data line has 16 integers, but the code only needs the first two (full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals) to determine the outcome.

So, during the test phase, the code must:

For each match in n:

Read the pre data line, split into 8 fields.

Parse the time into hour and minute.

Lookup home_team's home_stats and away_team's away_stats.

Lookup referee's stats.

Construct the feature vector as done during training.

Predict probabilities.

Compute EVs.

Output bet.

Read the post data line, split into 16 fields.

Update home_stats and away_stats.

Now, implementing this.

But how to handle new teams and referees in the test data:

For teams not present in home_stats or away_stats (i.e., not in the training data), the code will use default values (all zeros).

For referees not present in referee_stats, use default values.

But during the code's initialization, home_stats and away_stats were built from the training data. Any new team in the test data will start with zero matches.

Thus, for example, a new home_team in the test data will have home_matches=0, so the code's feature extraction will use zero win rates, etc.

But in the feature extraction code during testing, the code must handle division by zero cases (e.g., when a new team has zero matches).

Thus, during feature extraction, when home_matches is zero, the various rates (home_win_rate, etc.) are set to zero.

Thus, the code during testing:

For each test match:

pre_data_line = input().split()

division = int(pre_data_line[0])
time_str = pre_data_line[1]
home_team = int(pre_data_line[2])

But this code has some potential issues:

- The model's target encoding (LabelEncoder) may have classes ordered as HOME=0, DRAW=1, AWAY=2, which must match the order during training. So during prediction, the probabilities are ordered accordingly.

- The code uses XGBoost's predict_proba, which returns probabilities in the order of the classes as per the LabelEncoder.

But assuming that during training, the LabelEncoder is used to encode the target as HOME=0, DRAW=1, AWAY=2, then the probabilities will be in that order.

Another issue is handling missing values in the test data's Time field. The code tries to parse the time_str, but may need to handle other formats or missing values.

But given the example input, where time_str is '-1' when missing, the code handles that.

Now, putting all this together into a single Python script.

But the code must read the training data, process it, train the model, and then process the test matches.

However, there are some challenges:

- Time and memory constraints. The training data could be large, but the code must process it efficiently.

- Handling the test matches' post data to update home_stats and away_stats.

But given the problem's constraints (n up to 8500), and the model being XGBoost which is fast for predictions, the code should be feasible.

Now, the code:

But in the code submission, the code must read input from stdin and write output to stdout. So the code must first read the training data, train the model, then process the test matches.

Thus, the full code would look something like this:

Import necessary libraries:

import sys
import urllib.request
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

Then, download and read the training data:

response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)

But there are several potential issues here:

- The code may take too long to download the training data. But during the contest's testing phase, the code would have to handle this.

- Memory constraints: storing the entire training data and the model may exceed the memory limits.

- The code may not handle cases where the post data line has missing values (e.g., full_time_home_goals and full_time_away_goals may be missing?), but according to the problem's input example, the post data line has 16 integers, with the first two being the full_time_home_goals and away_goals, which are available. So the code can safely read them.

Another issue is that in the training data, some fields may be missing (like home_shots, etc.), but the code does not use those fields during training, so it's not a problem.

Finally, the code outputs nothing (i.e., skips the bet) if all EVs are negative. However, the example output shows three lines for three matches, implying that each match was bet on. But according to the problem statement, skipping is allowed.

But according to the output format, the code must output exactly one of HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or nothing for each match. Thus, the code uses print() to output nothing, which results in a newline. However, the example's output does not have newlines for skipped bets. So this may be a problem.

Wait, the example input has three matches, and the example output shows three lines (DRAW, HOME, AWAY), which suggests that each match's bet is output, even if skipped. But according to the problem's note, skipping a bet gives 0 points and is done by not printing anything. But the example output shows three lines, implying that each match is bet on.

But in the code, when all EVs are negative, the code outputs nothing (i.e., a blank line). However, the problem's output expects that each match's bet is output as either HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or nothing. So for three matches, there must be exactly three lines in the output, each corresponding to the bet for each match, in order.

But according to the code, if a bet is skipped, it prints a blank line. But the example output shows three lines with non-blank outputs. So in the code, for each match, the code must output exactly one line, which can be HOME, DRAW, AWAY, or empty (for skip).

But in Python, print() adds a newline. So for a skipped bet, the code outputs a newline. For non-skipped bets, it outputs the bet followed by a newline.

But according to the problem's example input and output, the output lines correspond to the matches in order, with each line containing one of the three options or empty.

Thus, the code is correct.

In conclusion, this code:

- Downloads the training data, processes it to compute historical features for teams and referees.

- Trains an XGBoost model to predict outcome probabilities.

- For each test match, uses the model to predict and compute expected values, then outputs the best bet or skips.

- Updates the team stats based on the test match's post data.

This should be the optimal approach given the problem's constraints.
