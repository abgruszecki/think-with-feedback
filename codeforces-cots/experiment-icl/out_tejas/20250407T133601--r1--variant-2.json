The stubs are a.\n\nThen, while stubs >= b:\n\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until stubs < b.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nstubs =4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. total +=2 (now 4+2=6). stubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNext iteration: stubs=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total +=1 (7). stubs=0 +1=1. Now 1 <2. Exit. Total is 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\nstubs=6.\n\nnew_candles=6//3=2. total +=2 (6+2=8). stubs=0 +2=2. 2 <3. Exit. So total is 8.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nSo this loop will handle all the possible conversions.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be straightforward.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a, stubs =a.\n\nLoop while stubs >=b:\n\n    new = stubs //b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = (stubs %b) + new\n\nThen print total.\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nstubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew=2. total=4+2=6. stubs=0+2=2.\n\nLoop again:\n\nnew=1. total=6+1=7. stubs=0+1=1. Exit.\n\nOutput 7.\n\nSecond sample:\n\na=6, b=3.\n\nstubs=6.\n\nnew=2. total=8. stubs=0+2=2. 2<3. Exit. Output 8.\n\nAnother test case: let's say a=5, b=2.\n\nInitial total 5. stubs=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//2=2. total 7. stubs=5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNext iteration: 3//2=1. total 8. stubs=1+1=2.\n\nNext: 2//2=1. total 9. stubs=0+1=1. Exit. So total is 5+2+1+1=9? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, initial a=5. So first total is 5. stubs=5.\n\nFirst loop: new=2. total becomes 5+2=7. stubs=5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nSecond loop: new=3//2=1. total 8. stubs=3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nThird loop: new=1. total 9. stubs=0 +1=1. Exit. So total is 9.\n\nYes. So for a=5, b=2, output is 9.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, in Python, the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code. It's O(log_b a) time, which is acceptable for the constraints (a up to 1e3, so even for 1e3, log_2(1e3) is about 10 steps. So even for 1e4 test cases, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1744050935, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 934, "prompt_tokens": 9424, "total_tokens": 10358, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "provider": "Targon"}
