Exit. So total 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total=7, stubs=7.\n\nFirst iteration: 7//3=2. total=9. stubs=7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//3=1. total=10. stubs=0 +1=1. Exit. So total 10.\n\nWhich is 7 +2 +1=10. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, in Python, the code is straightforward. Read a and b, compute as per the loop.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code. It's O(log_b a) time, which is acceptable for the constraints (a up to 1e3, which is very small). So even for a=1e3 and b=2, the loop runs about 10 times (since each time the stubs are halved, but added with the remainder). So no problem with time.\n\nSo this should be the correct solution.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1744050996, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 492, "prompt_tokens": 9819, "total_tokens": 10311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "provider": "Chutes"}
