Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find all prefixes of the string that are also suffixes. For each such prefix, we need to determine how many times it appears as a substring in the original string. Then, output these prefixes in increasing order of their lengths along with their counts.

First, I need to understand the problem correctly. Let's take the first example: ABACABA. The output lists prefixes of lengths 1,3,7. The prefix of length 1 is "A", which matches the suffix of length 1. Then, the count is 4, which means "A" appears 4 times as a substring. Similarly, the prefix of length 3 is "ABA", which is also the suffix of length 3. It occurs twice. The entire string is a prefix and suffix and occurs once.

So the steps are:

1. Find all possible prefixes that are also suffixes. These are the possible candidates.
2. For each such candidate (with length li), compute how many times it appears as a substring in the string.
3. Output them in order of increasing li.

First, how to find all prefixes that are also suffixes?

The standard way to find all such prefixes is to use the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) failure function. The failure function array (often called 'pi') for the string s tells us, for each position i, the length of the longest proper prefix of s[0..i] which is also a suffix. So, by backtracking through the failure function from the end of the string, we can collect all the possible lengths where a prefix equals a suffix.

For example, in the first example, the failure function for the last character would give the length 3 (since the longest prefix matching the suffix is "ABA"). Then, we check the failure function at position 3, which would give 1 (the prefix "A"). Then, we check at position 1, which gives 0, so we stop. So the lengths are 7 (the entire string), 3, and 1. But wait, the sample output lists them in the order 1,3,7. Oh right, but the output needs to be in increasing order of li. So when we collect the lengths, we need to collect them in reverse order and then sort them. Wait, no. Because when you backtrack using the failure function, you get the largest possible first. For instance, the entire string is length 7. Then the failure function for position 6 (assuming 0-based) would be 3 (since the longest prefix/suffix is length 3), then the failure function for position 3-1 (since the length is 3, but indexes are 0-based) would be 1, then the failure function for position 0 (length 1-1=0) would be 0. So the lengths collected would be 7,3,1. Then, we need to reverse them to get 1,3,7, then output in that order.

So step 1 is to compute the KMP failure function for the string. Then, collect all the possible prefix-suffix lengths by following the failure function from the end, including the full length (since the full string is a prefix and suffix of itself). Then, these lengths are stored, sorted, and for each of these lengths, compute the number of times that substring occurs in s.

Now, the next problem is, for each length li, compute how many times the substring (which is the prefix of length li) occurs in s.

The straightforward approach would be, for each li, count all occurrences of the substring. But if the string is up to 1e5 in length, and there could be up to O(n) such li's (like in the case where the string is all 'A's, like the second example), then for each li, doing a KMP search to count occurrences would take O(n) per li, leading to O(n^2) time, which is way too slow for n=1e5.

So we need a way to compute the count for each possible substring (the prefixes that are also suffixes) efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think about how to compute the occurrence count for all possible prefixes. For a given substring t (the prefix of length li), the count is the number of times t appears in s as a substring.

To compute the counts efficiently for multiple patterns (all the possible prefixes that are also suffixes), we can precompute for each possible substring (which are prefixes) their occurrence counts. But how?

An alternative approach is to note that all the candidate substrings (prefixes that are also suffixes) are nested. For example, the longest is the entire string, then the next is a prefix of that, etc. So perhaps using a suffix automaton or a trie structure that allows efficient counting of all occurrences.

But building a suffix automaton is O(n) time and space, and then for each state, we can compute the size (number of occurrences) of the corresponding substring. That might be the way to go.

Wait, the suffix automaton of the string s can represent all possible substrings, and for each node (which represents a set of substrings), we can track the number of occurrences. Then, for each candidate prefix (which is a substring), we can find the corresponding node in the suffix automaton and get its occurrence count.

But building a suffix automaton and then for each candidate prefix (which is a substring), we need to find the node that represents exactly that prefix and then get the occurrence count.

But how to map each prefix to the corresponding node in the suffix automaton. Let's think.

When building the suffix automaton, each state can track the length of the substring. The initial steps would be to build the automaton, and then for each possible prefix (i.e., the substring s[0..li-1], for li from 1 to n), we can keep a reference to the state in the automaton that corresponds to that substring.

Then, for each such state, the occurrence count is the size (the number of times the substring occurs in s). The suffix automaton's size for a state is the number of times the corresponding substring occurs.

So the plan is:

1. Build the suffix automaton for the string s.

2. Precompute for each possible prefix (li) the corresponding state in the suffix automaton. This can be done by tracking the current state as we build the automaton. For example, during the construction of the suffix automaton, for each character added, we can track the current end state (the state representing the entire prefix up to that character), and store these in an array. So for each prefix length li, the state is the end state after adding the first li characters. Let's call this array 'prefix_states', where prefix_states[i] is the state in the suffix automaton corresponding to the prefix of length i+1 (since indexes start at 0, perhaps).

3. Then, for each candidate li (the prefixes that are also suffixes), retrieve the state from prefix_states[li-1], and get the size (occurrence count) from that state.

So the steps are:

- Use KMP failure function to find all li where prefix li is a suffix.

- For each such li, get the count by looking up the suffix automaton's size for that prefix.

This approach would have O(n) time for building the suffix automaton, and O(n) time for the KMP processing, and O(k) time for the queries (where k is the number of candidates). Which is feasible for n=1e5.

But building a suffix automaton in Python may be a bit challenging, but possible. Also, the suffix automaton's size can be tracked for each state. Let me recall how the suffix automaton works.

The suffix automaton's nodes (states) represent equivalence classes of substrings. Each state has a length (the maximum length of the substring in that class), a link (a suffix link to another state), and transitions (edges to other states via characters). The size (number of occurrences) can be computed by counting the number of times a state is on a path that ends at the end of the string. Or perhaps, the size is computed during the construction via certain steps.

Wait, the standard way to compute the number of occurrences is to, after building the suffix automaton, perform a topological sort of the states in order of decreasing length, and then propagate the counts. For each state, the occurrence count is the sum of the counts of its suffix links plus the number of times it is the end of a path. Alternatively, during the construction, each time a new state is created, we can track how many times it's been encountered.

Alternatively, perhaps in the suffix automaton, the 'size' (the number of occurrences) of each state can be calculated using the method where each state's size is 1 (if it's a terminal state, i.e., the end of the string) plus the sum of the sizes of its transitions. But I need to check.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to compute the number of occurrences for each state is as follows:

The size of a state is the number of distinct positions where the substring (corresponding to the state) ends in the string. So, for example, the substring "A" in "AAA" would have a size of 3, as it ends at positions 0,1,2.

The standard approach to compute the size is:

1. When building the suffix automaton, each time you clone a state (during the split process), you can track the 'count' of occurrences.

But I might be mixing up different methods here. Let me think again.

The suffix automaton's states can be augmented with a 'cnt' attribute that represents the number of occurrences of the substrings represented by that state. To compute this, after building the automaton, you perform a reverse topological order traversal (from longest to shortest), and accumulate the counts. Each state's cnt is initialized to 1 if it's a terminal state (i.e., it's part of the path that represents the entire string), and then for each transition, you add the cnt of the target state to the current state's cnt.

Wait, perhaps that's the way. For example, in the suffix automaton, each state can have a 'cnt' that represents the number of times the substrings ending at that state occur as substrings in the string. So for the state that represents the empty string, its cnt would be the sum of the cnts of all transitions from it, which would give the total number of substrings. But that's not exactly what we need here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'cnt' for a state is the number of occurrences of the substrings that are represented by that state.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute, for each state, the number of times the corresponding substring appears as a substring in s.

Each state in the suffix automaton corresponds to a set of substrings. The 'length' of the state is the maximum length of those substrings. The number of occurrences is the number of ending positions where the substring occurs. For example, if the substring is 'A' in 'AAA', it occurs 3 times. For each state, the 'cnt' is the number of occurrences of the substrings it represents.

The way to compute this is to:

1. For each state, during construction, track the number of times it's been reached as the end of an extension. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, the 'cnt' can be computed by first initializing all terminal states (those that can reach the end of the automaton) with cnt=1, and then propagating the cnt backward through the suffix links. Because a state's cnt will include the cnt of all states that can be reached by following the suffix links. For example, if state A has a suffix link to state B, then state B's substrings are suffixes of state A's substrings. So whenever state A's substring appears, so do state B's.

But I'm not sure. Let's look for a resource.

Upon checking, the standard method to compute the number of occurrences for each state in a suffix automaton is as follows:

Each time a new state is created, we can track the number of occurrences. However, during the construction, each state can be given a 'count' which represents the number of times it's the end of a substring. However, this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, after building the suffix automaton, we can process the states in reverse order of their length (from largest to smallest), and for each state, add its 'count' to the count of its suffix link. This is because the suffix link's substrings are suffixes of the current state's substrings, so every occurrence of the current state's substring implies an occurrence of the suffix link's substring.

This way, the 'count' of a state will accumulate all the occurrences of its own substrings plus those of all longer substrings that include it as a suffix.

But in our case, we need the exact count for each specific substring. For example, for the substring of length li (the prefix), how many times does it appear in the string.

So perhaps the correct approach is to build the suffix automaton, then for each state, compute the 'size' (number of occurrences) by the following steps:

1. The initial step is to mark the terminal states. The terminal states are those that lie on the path of the last added character. So, after building the automaton, we start from the last state (the one added when processing the last character) and follow the suffix links all the way to the initial state. All these states are terminal.

2. For each terminal state, we set its 'cnt' to 1. Then, for all states processed in reverse order of length (from largest to smallest), we add their 'cnt' to their suffix link's 'cnt'. This is because whenever a state's substring occurs, its suffix link's substring (which is a suffix of it) also occurs. So this way, the 'cnt' of each state represents the number of times the corresponding substring appears as a suffix in some substring of s.

Wait, perhaps this approach counts the number of occurrences of the substring as a suffix. But we need the total number of occurrences anywhere in the string.

Hmm, maybe there's another approach. Another way to calculate the number of occurrences of a substring is to use the suffix automaton's 'size' property, which can be computed during the construction. The 'size' of a state is the number of times the substrings represented by that state occur in the string. For example, the substring "A" in "AAA" would have a size of 3. 

The way to compute this is to note that each occurrence of a substring can be represented by its end positions. For example, the substring s[i..j] ends at position j. So, the number of occurrences of a substring is equal to the number of end positions j where that substring occurs.

In the suffix automaton, each state corresponds to some substrings. For a state u, the number of end positions is given by the size of the state's 'endpos' set. However, storing these sets is not feasible for large n. Instead, during the construction of the suffix automaton, each state can track the size of its endpos set (the number of distinct end positions). However, for our problem, the count we need is the total number of occurrences of the substring, which is the sum over all possible occurrences. Wait, no. The endpos size is the number of distinct end positions. For example, the substring "A" in "AAA" can have end positions at 0,1,2. So the endpos size is 3. But the total number of occurrences is 3. So perhaps the endpos size is exactly the count we need. So for each state u, the count we want is the size of u's endpos set.

So, the problem reduces to, for each prefix that is also a suffix (li), find the state in the suffix automaton that corresponds to that prefix, then get the endpos size of that state.

The challenge is then to compute the endpos sizes for all states, and then for the specific prefixes, retrieve their endpos sizes.

But how is the endpos size computed in the suffix automaton?

During the construction of the suffix automaton, each state has a 'size' or 'cnt' attribute that represents the size of its endpos set. However, in practice, building this requires some modifications to the standard suffix automaton code.

The standard suffix automaton implementation can be modified to track the endpos sizes as follows:

Each time a new state is created, its endpos size is initialized to 1 (since it's created when a new character is added, so the end position is the current length). When a state is cloned (during the split process), the original state's endpos size is split between the clone and the original. However, this isn't straightforward. 

An alternative approach is to compute the endpos sizes after building the automaton. The endpos size for a state u is equal to the number of paths from u to a terminal state. But this might not be correct.

Alternatively, the endpos size can be computed by traversing the suffix automaton in a topological order (from longest to shortest), and for each state, propagating the endpos sizes. For example:

Each state u has a 'link' (suffix link) to another state. The endpos size of a state u is equal to the number of times u is the target of a suffix link from a state with larger length. Wait, perhaps not.

Another approach: during construction, each time a new state is created, we can track the occurrences. The endpos size of a state is the number of times it was created or updated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, according to some references, the number of occurrences of a substring can be determined by the number of times the state's nodes are visited during the automaton's traversal. However, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient way is to use a suffix array and LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to compute the counts. But building a suffix array for a string of length 1e5 is possible, but the LCP approach might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, for each candidate li (the length of the prefix that is also a suffix), the substring is fixed (it's s[0..li-1]). The count is the number of times this substring appears in s. So, for example, for the substring "A", the count is the number of times "A" appears as a substring.

To compute this, for each li, the count can be found using the KMP preprocessing. Let's precompute the failure function for the entire string. Then, for each candidate prefix (which is the pattern), use the KMP search to find all occurrences. However, this would be O(n) per candidate, which is O(n^2) in the worst case (like when all possible li are present, which is the case when the string is all same characters). For n=1e5, this is 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible. Thus, the suffix automaton approach seems necessary.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Compute the KMP failure function to find all candidate li (prefixes that are also suffixes).

2. Build the suffix automaton for the string s, and for each state, compute the endpos size (number of occurrences of the substrings in that state).

3. For each candidate li, find the state corresponding to the prefix s[0..li-1], and then get the endpos size of that state.

Now, the problem is how to find the state corresponding to the prefix of length li. Since the prefix is the first li characters, during the construction of the suffix automaton, we can track the state after each character is added. For example, after adding the first character, the current state is the state representing the entire prefix (length 1). So, we can keep an array 'prefix_states' where prefix_states[i] is the state of the suffix automaton after processing the first (i+1) characters (since i starts at 0). Thus, for the prefix of length li, the state is prefix_states[li-1].

So during the construction of the suffix automaton, after each character is added, we save the current state (the one that represents the entire prefix up to that point) in the prefix_states array. Then, for each candidate li, we can look up the state in prefix_states[li-1], and then get its endpos size.

Now, implementing the suffix automaton in Python with all these steps.

Let me look up the standard implementation of a suffix automaton and adapt it.

The standard suffix automaton code (in C++) uses a structure for each state with len, link, transitions. So in Python, we can model this with a list of dictionaries or classes.

Here's a rough outline of the suffix automaton code in Python:

class State:
    def __init__(self):
        self.len = 0
        self.link = -1
        self.transitions = dict()  # char -> state index
        self.cnt = 0

sa = [State()]
last = 0
size = 1

def sa_extend(c):
    global last, size, sa
    p = last
    curr = size
    size += 1
    sa.append(State())
    sa[curr].len = sa[p].len + 1
    sa[curr].cnt = 1  # or some initial value?
    while p != -1 and c not in sa[p].transitions:
        sa[p].transitions[c] = curr
        p = sa[p].link
    if p == -1:
        sa[curr].link = 0
    else:
        q = sa[p].transitions[c]
        if sa[p].len + 1 == sa[q].len:
            sa[curr].link = q
        else:
            clone = size
            size += 1
            sa.append(State())
            sa[clone].len = sa[p].len + 1
            sa[clone].transitions = sa[q].transitions.copy()
            sa[clone].link = sa[q].link
            sa[clone].cnt = 0
            while p != -1 and sa[p].transitions[c] == q:
                sa[p].transitions[c] = clone
                p = sa[p].link
            sa[q].link = clone
            sa[curr].link = clone
    last = curr

Then, for each character in s, we call sa_extend(c). After building the automaton, we can compute the cnt for each state. But how?

After building the automaton, the cnt (number of occurrences) can be computed by traversing the states in reverse order of len (from largest to smallest) and adding their cnt to their link's cnt. Wait, but initially, each state's cnt is 1 if it was a new state created during sa_extend (like the curr and clone states). Or perhaps, the cnt is initialized as 1 for each state that corresponds to a position in the string. Wait, the clone states are not new end positions, so their cnt is 0, while the original states (curr and clone) may have different cnt.

Alternatively, the cnt can be calculated by propagating the values through the suffix links. The initial idea is that each state represents some substrings, and the cnt for a state is the number of times the corresponding substring occurs. The way to compute this is to first set the cnt for all states that are terminals (i.e., those that can reach the end of the string) to 1, and then accumulate the cnt through the suffix links.

But that's not exactly correct. Another approach is to note that the cnt for a state is the number of times its substrings appear in s as a substring. The number of occurrences of a substring is equal to the number of distinct end positions where it occurs. For example, the substring "A" in "AAA" has end positions 0,1,2: cnt is 3.

In the suffix automaton, each state's cnt can be computed as the number of times that state is a terminal state. However, this is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to compute the cnt is as follows:

Each time a new state is created (the curr in sa_extend), it represents a new end position (the current length of the string being built). So, each such state (the ones added via sa_extend, not the clones) has a cnt of 1. The clone states have their cnt set to 0 because they don't represent new end positions. Then, after building the automaton, we process the states in reverse order of len (from largest to smallest), and for each state, we add its cnt to the cnt of its link. This way, the cnt for a state represents the number of end positions (occurrences) that include that state's substrings.

So, during the sa_extend function, when we create a new state (curr), we set its cnt to 1. Clones have cnt 0. Then, after building all states, we process them in order of decreasing len and accumulate the cnt:

order = sorted(range(size), key=lambda x: -sa[x].len)
for state in order:
    link = sa[state].link
    if link != -1:
        sa[link].cnt += sa[state].cnt

But why does this work?

Each state's cnt is the number of end positions in which the substrings represented by that state end. The substrings represented by a state are all the suffixes of the longest substring for that state. For example, if the state's longest substring is "AB", then it also represents "B". The cnt for the state would be the number of end positions where "AB" ends plus the end positions of "B". But that's not correct. Wait, no. The cnt for a state is the number of end positions for the substrings that belong to that state. So, when you process the states in reverse order of len, for each state, you add its cnt to its link's cnt. This is because the link's state represents shorter substrings that are suffixes of the current state's substrings. So, for example, if a state's longest substring is "ABA", its link might represent "A". Then, the "A" occurs at all end positions where "ABA" occurs, so the link's cnt should be increased by the cnt of the current state.

By doing this for all states in reverse order of len, the cnt for each state accumulates the number of end positions of all its superstrings. This way, the cnt of a state represents the number of times its substrings (of all lengths) appear as substrings in the string.

Wait, but the initial approach for cnt is that each new state (curr) has cnt=1, clones have cnt=0. Then, when you process in reverse order, for each state, you add its cnt to its link's cnt. This would accumulate the cnt for all possible suffixes. So, for example, the longest state (the entire string) has cnt=1. Its link may have cnt=0 initially, but after processing, the link's cnt becomes 1. Then, the next state (shorter len) may have cnt=1, adding to its link's cnt. So, for each state, the cnt is the number of end positions where its substrings end.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's test with the example "AAA".

Building the suffix automaton:

After processing each 'A':

First 'A' (index 0):

- sa has state 0 (initial) and state 1. State1 has len=1, link=0, transitions. cnt=1.

Second 'A' (index 1):

- Extend with 'A'. p=1. Create state 2 with len=2. p transitions to 2. Check p's transitions. While p is not -1 and 'A' not in transitions. p=1 has transitions for 'A' to 1. So after first iteration, we break. Then, q = sa[p].transitions[c] = 1. Check if sa[p].len +1 == sa[q].len. sa[p].len is 1, sa[q].len is 1. 1+1 != 1. So we need to clone. Create clone state3. Clone's len is sa[p].len +1 =2. Clone's transitions are copy of q's transitions (which is {'A':1} or maybe different). Then, adjust p's transitions. Then, set q's link to clone. curr's link is clone. Then, last is curr.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps the example would be better:

Let's try building the suffix automaton for "AAA".

Start with state 0 (len 0, link -1, transitions empty).

Processing first 'A' (i=0):

- p = last =0.

- Create curr =1, len=1, link= -1.

- Then, check if p (0) has transition 'A'. Initially, no. So set transitions['A'] of 0 to 1. p becomes link of 0 (which is -1). So, curr's link is 0. Then, last is 1. cnt for state1 is 1.

Processing second 'A' (i=1):

- p=last=1.

- Create curr=2, len=2.

- While p !=-1 and 'A' not in transitions[p]. Check transitions of p=1: no 'A' transitions. So set transitions['A'] of p=1 to 2. p becomes link of 1, which is 0.

- Now, check transitions of p=0. It has 'A' to state1. So q=1.

- Check if sa[p].len +1 (0+1=1) equals sa[q].len (1). Yes. So link of curr=2 is q=1. So, last=2. cnt for state2 is 1.

Processing third 'A' (i=2):

- p=last=2.

- Create curr=3, len=3.

- While p !=-1 and transitions[p].get('A') is None. p=2 has no transitions. So set transitions['A'] to 3. p=2's link is 1. Now p=1. Check transitions: no 'A' transitions. Set transitions['A'] to 3. p becomes link of 1 (0). Check transitions of 0: has 'A' to state1. So q=1.

- Check if sa[p].len +1 (0+1=1) equals sa[q].len (1). Yes. So link of curr=3 is 1. last=3. cnt=1.

Now, after building, the states are:

State0: len 0, link -1, transitions {'A':1} (after first step?), but perhaps the transitions are updated as follows.

Wait, after first 'A', state0's transitions['A'] is 1.

After second 'A', state1's transitions['A'] is 2.

After third 'A', state2's transitions['A'] is 3. State1's transitions['A'] is 3 (during third step). So state1's transitions are {'A':3}?

Then, when processing the third 'A', during the while loop, p=2 (state2) transitions 'A' to 3, p becomes 1. Then, state1's transitions['A'] is set to 3, p becomes 0. Then, state0's transitions['A'] is 1. So q=1.

So, the clone step is not triggered here.

After all three 'A's, the states are:

state0: len 0, link -1, transitions {'A':1}.

state1: len 1, link 0, transitions {'A':3}.

state2: len 2, link 1, transitions {'A':3}.

state3: len3, link 1, transitions ... ?

But this seems incomplete. Maybe the actual transitions are different. But regardless, after building the automaton, the cnt for each state (state1, 2, 3) is 1. Then, during the processing in reverse order (len 3, 2, 1, 0):

Process state3: len3. Its link is 1. So add state3's cnt (1) to state1's cnt. State1's cnt becomes 1+1=2.

Process state2: len2, link1. Add 1 to state1's cnt. Now state1's cnt is 3.

Process state1: len1, link0. Add 3 to state0's cnt. State0's cnt is 3.

Process state0: link -1. Do nothing.

So after this processing, the cnt for each state is:

state3: 1.

state2: 1.

state1: 3.

state0: 3.

But the desired cnt for the prefixes that are also suffixes (li=1,2,3) are 3,2,1.

Wait, the prefix for li=3 is "AAA", which occurs once. For li=2, "AA" occurs twice. For li=1, "A" occurs 3 times.

But according to the suffix automaton:

The prefix of length 3 is "AAA". The state for this prefix is the one created when processing the third 'A' (state3). Its cnt after processing would be 1 (since after adding to its link, state1's cnt is 3, but state3's cnt remains 1). So the count for "AAA" is 1.

The prefix of length 2 is "AA". Its state is state2. Its cnt after processing is 1. But according to the code, after processing, the cnt for state2 is 1. But according to the example, "AA" occurs twice. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, this suggests that the approach to compute the cnt is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the cnt is calculated in the suffix automaton is different. Maybe the initial cnt for each state (curr) is 1, but after processing, the cnt represents the number of times the substring occurs as a substring. For "AAA":

The state3 (len3) corresponds to the substring "AAA", which occurs once. State2 (len2) corresponds to the substrings "AA", which occurs twice. State1 (len1) corresponds to "A", which occurs three times.

But according to the processing above, after accumulating the cnt:

state3's cnt is 1.

state2's cnt is 1.

state1's cnt is 3 (from state3 and state2's contributions).

state0's cnt is 3.

So perhaps the cnt for state1 is 3, which is correct for "A". But state2's cnt is 1, which is wrong.

So this suggests that the current approach is not correct.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the way the cnt is computed.

Another approach to compute the number of occurrences of a substring is to use the fact that the number of occurrences is equal to the number of times the substring appears in the string, which can be calculated as the sum over all possible end positions where the substring starts at some position and ends at the end position.

But how to calculate this for each substring.

Alternatively, the number of occurrences of a substring t is equal to the number of nodes in the suffix automaton's path that starts at the root and follows the characters of t, and the size of the endpos set of that node.

So for the substring "AA" in "AAA", the endpos set is {1,2} (assuming 0-based indexes?), so the count is 2.

But according to the suffix automaton processing above, the state for "AA" is state2, and its cnt after processing is 1, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the way the cnt is computed is wrong.

What's the correct way to compute the number of occurrences?

Upon further research, I found that the number of occurrences of a substring t in s is equal to the number of times t appears in s. This can be found using the suffix automaton by:

- For the state that corresponds to t, the occurrence count is the size of its endpos set.

But how to compute this size.

In the suffix automaton, each state has an endpos set. The size of this set can be computed during construction. Each time a new state is created (not cloned), it contributes a new end position. For cloned states, their endpos sets are a subset of the original state's endpos set.

Thus, during construction, when a new state is created (curr), we set its occurrence count (endpos size) to 1. Cloned states (created during the split process) have their occurrence count set to 0. Then, after all states are created, we perform a topological sort in reverse order of len, and for each state, we add its occurrence count to its link's occurrence count.

Wait, but how does this work?

Let me try with the "AAA" example.

States:

state0: len0, link-1, cnt=3 (after processing).

state1: len1, link0, cnt=3.

state2: len2, link1, cnt=1.

state3: len3, link1, cnt=1.

During construction:

- When state1 is created (first 'A'), cnt=1.

- When state2 is created (second 'A'), cnt=1.

- When state3 is created (third 'A'), cnt=1.

The clone step doesn't happen in this example.

Then, after construction, processing in reverse order:

state3 (cnt=1) has link to state1. So state1's cnt += 1 → becomes 1+1=2.

state2 (cnt=1) has link to state1. So state1's cnt +=1 → becomes 3.

state1 (cnt=3) has link to state0. state0's cnt +=3 → becomes 3.

state0 (link-1) → no change.

So state1's cnt is 3, which is correct for "A" (occurs 3 times).

state2's cnt is 1, which would correspond to "AA" occurring once. But in reality, "AA" occurs twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, so the problem is that the endpos size for state2 is 1, but it should be 2. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Another idea: during the sa_extend function, each time a new state is created (curr), it represents the end of the current string. So for each new state (curr), the endpos set contains the current index. For example, when the first 'A' is added, the state1's endpos is {0}. When the second 'A' is added, state2's endpos is {1}. When the third 'A' is added, state3's endpos is {2}.

But when a state is cloned, the clone takes over some of the endpos positions. For example, if a clone is created from q, then q's endpos is split between the clone and q. But tracking this is difficult.

Alternatively, the endpos size for a state can be computed as the number of times it was created as a new state (curr) plus the sum of the endpos sizes of the states that have their link pointing to it.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The endpos size of a state u is the number of times u is a suffix link parent of some other state. Because each time a state's suffix link points to u, it means that u's substrings are suffixes of that state's substrings, and thus their endpos sets are included.

Alternatively, the endpos size is computed by initializing the new states (those created via sa_extend, not clones) with endpos size 1, and clones with 0. Then, during the processing in reverse order of len, for each state, add its endpos size to its suffix link's endpos size.

This is the same as the previous approach. But in the "AAA" example, this gives state2's endpos size as 1, which is incorrect.

So there must be a mistake in the way the endpos size is being computed.

Alternatively, perhaps the endpos size is the number of times the state is a terminal state. But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps the suffix automaton approach is not the way to go. Let's think of other options.

Another approach: for each candidate prefix (li), the substring is s[0..li-1]. To count the number of occurrences of this substring in s, we can precompute the prefix function for all possible prefixes and use the KMP algorithm.

Wait, but the KMP algorithm's failure function (prefix function) is used to find the longest prefix which is also a suffix. But how to use it to count all occurrences.

Alternatively, for each pattern (the prefix of length li), we can precompute the failure function of the pattern and then run the KMP search on s to count the occurrences. But as mentioned earlier, this would be O(n) per li, which is O(n^2) in the worst case. Not feasible.

Another idea: for all possible prefixes, precompute the occurrence counts using a suffix array and LCP array.

But building a suffix array for a string of length 1e5 is feasible. The suffix array can be built in O(n) or O(n log n) time. Then, using the LCP array, for each prefix, we can find the range in the suffix array where the prefix appears, and then compute the number of suffixes that start with the prefix, which is the number of occurrences.

But this also seems challenging. For example, for the prefix of length li, we need to find how many suffixes start with this prefix. Each such suffix corresponds to an occurrence of the prefix as a substring. The number of such suffixes is the number of times the prefix occurs as a substring (since each occurrence starts at some position in the string). So the count is equal to the number of times the prefix appears as a prefix of any suffix.

So, using the suffix array sorted lexicographically, we can find the first and last occurrence of the prefix in the suffix array. The number of occurrences is last - first +1.

But how to find the first and last occurrence for each prefix efficiently.

This approach requires that for each prefix of length li, we can perform a binary search on the suffix array to find the range of suffixes that start with this prefix. The length of the prefix is li, so during the binary search, we compare the first li characters of the suffixes.

But comparing li characters for each binary search step would lead to O(n log n * li) time per query, which is O(n^2 log n) in total. Not feasible for n=1e5.

Thus, this approach is not efficient enough.

Another idea: use a trie of all suffixes. Each path from the root to a node represents a prefix of a suffix. The count of the node is the number of suffixes that have this prefix. So, for a prefix of length li, the count is the number of nodes at depth li in the trie that correspond to exactly that prefix. However, building a trie for all suffixes of a string of length 1e5 would require O(n^2) time and space, which is impossible.

Thus, back to the suffix automaton approach.

Perhaps the correct way to compute the occurrence counts is to use the suffix automaton's ability to compute the number of occurrences for each state.

According to the e-maxx.ru article on suffix automaton (translated), the number of occurrences of a substring t can be calculated as the number of times the state corresponding to t was cloned during the automaton's construction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, according to the article, the number of occurrences of a substring t is equal to the size of the endpos set of the state corresponding to t. To compute the size of the endpos sets, the method is:

- Each time a new state is created (not a clone), its size is initialized to 1. Cloned states have size 0.

- Then, process all states in reverse order of len (from largest to smallest), and for each state, add its size to the size of its suffix link.

This way, the size of a state u is the number of endpos positions for the substrings represented by u.

Let's try this for the "AAA" example.

Processing:

After building the automaton, the states are:

state0: len0, link-1, size=0 (since it's not a new state created as curr).

state1: len1, link0, size=1.

state2: len2, link1, size=1.

state3: len3, link1, size=1.

Processing in reverse order:

state3: size=1. link is state1. state1.size +=1 → 1+1=2.

state2: size=1. link is state1. state1.size +=1 → 2+1=3.

state1: size=3. link is state0. state0.size +=3 → 0+3=3.

state0: link-1.

So after processing, the sizes are:

state3.size =1 → corresponds to "AAA" → occurs once.

state2.size=1 → "AA" → occurs once. But in reality, "AA" occurs twice.

Hmm, so this approach also gives the wrong count. So there's something wrong here.

Wait, what's the endpos set for state2 in the "AAA" example?

state2 corresponds to the substring "AA". The endpos set is {1} (assuming 0-based indexes) because the second 'A' is at index1 (if the string is 0-based). But the substring "AA" can end at index1 (position 0-1) and index2 (position1-2). So the endpos set should be {1,2}, size 2.

But according to the algorithm, state2's size is 1. So the algorithm is not capturing this.

So why?

In the "AAA" example, when adding the third 'A', the code for sa_extend would create state3. Then, when processing the third 'A', the p starts as last=2 (state2). The code then loops through p=2 and p=1.

For state2 (p=2), since 'A' is not in its transitions, it sets transitions['A'] to 3. p becomes state2's link, which is state1.

For state1 (p=1), 'A' is not in its transitions (after state2's transitions are set?), so transitions['A'] is set to 3. Then p becomes state0.

Then, for state0, 'A' is in transitions, pointing to state1. So q=1.

Check if sa[p].len+1 (0+1=1) equals sa[q].len (1). Yes. So state3's link is state1.

So state3's transitions are empty (since it's a new state), and after processing, state3's len is 3, link is state1.

The state3 represents the substring "AAA", which ends at position 2. Its size is 1.

State2's size is 1 (created during the second 'A' processing, which ends at position 1). State1's size is 1 (created during the first 'A' processing, ends at position 0).

When we process state2 in reverse order, we add its size (1) to state1's size (1+1=2). Then state1's size becomes 2. Processing state3's size (1) adds to state1's size (2+1=3). Then state1's size is 3. When processing state1, its size (3) is added to state0's size (0+3=3). But the state2's size is 1, which is incorrect.

But state2's substring is "AA", which ends at positions 1 and 2. So its size should be 2.

But according to the algorithm, state2's size is 1, which suggests that the algorithm is not capturing the multiple occurrences.

This implies that the approach is incorrect. So what's the mistake here?

Ah! Because in the "AAA" example, after adding the third 'A', state3 is created. But during the sa_extend function, state2's transition to 'A' is set to 3. Then, when the third 'A' is added, the state3 is created, which represents the substring of length 3. So, state2's transition 'A' is state3, which represents the substring of length 3. But state2 represents the substring of length 2, which ends at position 1. So state2's endpos is {1}.

But in reality, the substring "AA" can end at positions 1 and 2. For example:

In "AAA", the substring "AA" occurs as positions 0-1 and 1-2. So the end positions are 1 and 2.

But according to the automaton's construction, state2's endpos is {1}, and state3's endpos is {2}.

 state1's endpos is {0,1,2} (from the accumulated size of 3).

Wait, but how can state1's endpos be {0,1,2} when it's supposed to represent the substring "A" of length 1. The end positions would be 0,1,2. So the size is 3, which is correct.

 state2's endpos is {1} (size 1), but it's supposed to have endpos {1,2} (size 2).

So the algorithm is missing the end position 2 for state2.

But why?

Because state2's transition 'A' is set to state3. So when we add the third 'A', the path from state2 via 'A' leads to state3. So the state3 represents the substring of length 3. So when processing the third 'A', the state3 is added. The end positions for state3 is {2} (since it's created during the third 'A' processing). So state2's endpos is {1}, state3's endpos is {2}.

But the substring "AA" can end at 2 (positions 1 and 2). So why is there no state that has endpos {2} for "AA"?

Ah, perhaps the automaton's states represent different equivalence classes. In this case, the substring "AA" ending at position 2 is represented by state3's suffix link. But state3's suffix link is state1. So state1 represents all "A" occurrences, including those that are part of longer substrings.

This suggests that the automaton's way of tracking endpos sizes is not directly giving the count for each substring, but rather the count of distinct end positions for the substrings represented by that state. But how to get the total occurrences.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to find another way to compute the occurrence counts.

Another idea: use a Z-array (Z-algorithm) to find for each position the longest prefix starting at that position. For each candidate prefix (li), the number of times it appears as a substring is the number of positions i where the Z-array value at i is >= li.

But building the Z-array for the string takes O(n) time, and then for each candidate li, we can count the number of positions where Z[i] >= li. For example, for the prefix "A" (li=1), count the number of positions where Z[i] >=1. In "AAA", the Z-array would be [3,2,1,0]. For positions 0,1,2, the Z-values are 3,2,1. So for li=1, the count is 3 (positions 0,1,2). For li=2, count the positions where Z[i] >=2. Positions 0 and 1 (Z[0]=3 >=2, Z[1]=2 >=2), so count is 2. For li=3, only position 0 has Z[i] >=3, count is 1.

This method would correctly compute the counts.

So the steps would be:

1. Compute all candidate li's using the KMP failure function.

2. Compute the Z-array for the string s.

3. For each candidate li, compute the number of positions i where Z[i] >= li. This will give the number of occurrences of the prefix of length li.

This approach is O(n) for steps 1 and 2, and O(n) for each candidate li, but if the number of candidates is O(n), then this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

But wait, the candidates li are the prefixes that are also suffixes. For example, in the "AAA" case, the candidates are 1,2,3. For each of these, we need to count the number of positions i where Z[i] >= li.

But the Z-array for the entire string is O(n) time to compute. And for each candidate li, we can precompute a frequency array that stores the count of Z-values >= li. But how to do this efficiently.

We can precompute an array cnt, where cnt[li] is the number of positions i where Z[i] >= li.

But how to compute this array efficiently for all possible li.

This can be done using a frequency array, and then a suffix sum array.

For example:

- Create an array freq of size n+1, initialized to 0.

- For each Z value in the Z-array, increment freq[Z[i]] by 1.

- Then, compute the suffix sum array sum_cnt, where sum_cnt[li] = sum_{k=li to n} freq[k].

- Then, for any li, the count is sum_cnt[li].

But this works only if Z[i] is the maximum possible prefix length starting at i. Because if Z[i] is 3, it means that the prefix of length 3 starts at i. But also, the prefixes of length 1,2,3 also start at i.

So, for example, if Z[i] is 3, then it contributes to the count of li=1,2,3. But the frequency approach would count it once for freq[3], and sum_cnt[li] for li=1 would include freq[3], but this is not correct.

Ah, right. Because for each Z[i], the number of li's that are <= Z[i] is Z[i] terms. For example, Z[i] =3 contributes to li=1,2,3.

Thus, the frequency array approach would undercount, because it counts each Z[i] as contributing 1 to exactly freq[Z[i]], but in reality, it contributes 1 to all li's up to Z[i].

So, the correct way to compute sum_cnt[li] is to calculate the number of Z[i] >= li. Which is the same as summing for each Z[i], if Z[i] >= li, add 1.

The naive way is O(n^2), which is not feasible. But we can compute it in O(n) time using a line sweep.

Here's how:

1. Create an array of Z-values.

2. Create an array cnt of size n+2, initialized to 0.

3. For each z in Z-values:

   a. Increment cnt[z] by 1.

4. Compute a suffix sum array sum_cnt, where sum_cnt[li] = sum_{k=li}^n cnt[k].

5. For each li, the count is sum_cnt[li].

But wait, this is the same as before. But this approach counts the number of Z-values exactly equal to li. But we need to count the number of Z-values >= li.

For example, if a Z-value is 3, it contributes to li=1, 2, 3. So, the correct sum for li=1 is the number of Z-values >=1, which is the sum of cnt[1] + cnt[2] + ... + cnt[n].

Similarly, sum_cnt[li] = sum_{k=li}^n cnt[k].

But how is this achieved?

The standard way to compute sum_cnt is to create a frequency array where cnt[k] is the number of Z-values that are exactly k, and then sum_cnt[li] is the sum of cnt[k] for k >= li.

But this is not correct. Because a Z-value of k contributes to all li's up to k. So the correct sum_cnt[li] is the number of Z-values that are >= li.

But the sum_cnt[li] can be computed as the number of Z-values >= li.

To compute this, we can create an array of frequencies where we count for each possible k how many Z-values are exactly k. Then, the suffix sum from li to n gives the number of Z-values >= li.

But this is correct.

For example, if Z-values are [3,2,1,0], then:

cnt[3] =1, cnt[2] =1, cnt[1] =1, cnt[0]=1.

sum_cnt[1] = cnt[1] + cnt[2] + cnt[3] = 3.

sum_cnt[2] = cnt[2]+cnt[3] = 2.

sum_cnt[3] = cnt[3] =1.

Which is correct.

So, this approach works.

Thus, the steps are:

- Compute the Z-array for the entire string s.

- For each possible li (candidates), the count is sum_cnt[li], where sum_cnt[li] is the number of Z-values >= li.

 sum_cnt can be computed as a suffix sum array.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

1. Find all candidate li's using KMP failure function.

2. Compute Z-array for s.

3. Compute the frequency array for Z-values.

4. Compute the suffix sum array sum_cnt.

5. For each candidate li, if sum_cnt[li] >=0, then output li and sum_cnt[li].

This approach is O(n) time for all steps, which is feasible.

Now, how to implement this.

First, the KMP failure function to find all candidate li's.

Then, compute the Z-array.

The Z-array for a string s is an array Z where Z[i] is the length of the longest substring starting at i which is also a prefix of s.

The algorithm to compute the Z-array is as follows:

Initialize n = len(s), Z = array of length n, Z[0] = 0.

For i from 1 to n-1:

   l = 0, r =0.

   if i <= r:

      k = i - l

      if Z[k] < r -i +1:

          Z[i] = Z[k]

      else:

          l =i

          while r <n and s[r] == s[r - l]:

              r +=1

          Z[i] = r - l

          r -=1

   else:

      l = r =i

      while r <n and s[r] == s[r - l]:

          r +=1

      Z[i] = r - l

      r -=1

This is the standard O(n) algorithm for Z-array.

Once the Z-array is computed, we can create a frequency array.

For example, for s = "AAA", the Z-array would be [3, 2, 1, 0] (assuming 0-based indexes). But wait, the Z-array for "AAA" is:

Z[0] is undefined, but typically set to 0.

Wait, the Z-array is usually defined with Z[0] =0, and for i>0:

For "AAA", indexes are 0-based.

i=0: Z[0] = 0 (not considered).

i=1: Compare s[1..] with s[0..]. The substring starting at i=1 is "AA", which matches the prefix "AA" (since s[0..1] is "AA"). So Z[1] = 2.

i=2: substring is "A" matches prefix "A". Z[2] =1.

i=3: no characters left. Z[3] =0.

So Z-array is [0, 2, 1, 0].

Wait, but the standard algorithm may give different results. Let me recompute.

Wait, the algorithm for Z[0] is undefined. For i=0, Z[0] is usually set to 0. For i>=1:

For i=1 in "AAA":

l and r are initialized to 0 and 0.

Then, since i=1 is > r (0), set l=r=i=1.

Compare s[1] to s[0], which is 'A' == 'A' → increment r to 2.

Compare s[2] to s[1], 'A' == 'A' → increment r to 3.

Now r is 3, which is equal to n=3. So Z[i=1] = r-l = 3-1=2.

Set r=2.

For i=2:

i=2 <= r=2.

k = i-l = 2-1=1. Z[1] is 2.

Since Z[k] =2 is not less than r-i+1= 2-2+1=1.

So, we start comparing from r+1=3 (which is beyond the string). So Z[i=2] = 2-2=0.

Wait, this can't be right. Let's re-examine.

Wait, perhaps my understanding of the algorithm is wrong. Let me look up the correct algorithm.

The correct Z-algorithm works as follows:

Initialize n = len(s)

Z = [0]*n

l, r =0,0

for i in range(1, n):

    if i > r:

        l = r =i

        while r <n and s[r - l] == s[r]:

            r +=1

        Z[i] = r - l

        r -=1

    else:

        k = i - l

        if Z[k] < r -i +1:

            Z[i] = Z[k]

        else:

            l =i

            while r <n and s[r - l] == s[r]:

                r +=1

            Z[i] = r - l

            r -=1

So for "AAA":

n=3, indexes 0,1,2.

i=1:

i is 1> r=0, so l=r=1.

Compare s[0] (s[r-l] when r=1) to s[1] (s[r]). They are 'A' == 'A' → r=2.

Compare s[1-1=0] (s[0]) to s[2] (s[2]). 'A' == 'A' → r=3 (now r >=n).

Z[1] =3-1=2. r is set to 2.

i=2:

i <= r (2<=2).

k =2-1=1.

Z[k]= Z[1]=2.

r -i +1 =2-2+1=1.

Z[k] (2) >= 1.

So, we set l =i=2.

Compare s[0] (s[r-l=2-2=0]) to s[r=2], which is 'A' == 'A' → r=3.

Z[2] =3-2=1. r=2.

So the Z-array is [0,2,1].

So the Z-values for "AAA" are Z[0]=0, Z[1]=2, Z[2]=1.

Now, for each candidate li:

li=1: the number of Z-values >=1 is Z[0] (0) is not considered (since i=0 is the entire string). Z[1] >=1 → yes (2>=1), Z[2] >=1 → yes (1>=1). So count is 2+1=3? Wait, no. Because the Z-array is for i >=1. For each position i in the string, including the entire string (i=0), but according to the Z-array definition, the Z[0] is not used. The count is the number of positions i where the substring starting at i is a prefix of s. So for the prefix of length li, the occurrences are the number of positions i where Z[i] >= li.

But the entire string (i=0) is also a occurrence. But according to the Z-array, Z[0] is 0. So when li=3 (the entire string), the count is 1 (i=0). When li=2, the count is the number of i where Z[i] >=2. For "AAA", Z[1]=2 >=2 → count 1 (i=1), and i=0 (the entire string) is also a occurrence. So how to include i=0?

Ah, here's the problem. The Z-array does not consider the occurrence at i=0. So to count all occurrences of the prefix of length li, we need to include the occurrence at i=0 if li <= n.

So for the prefix of length li, the count is sum_cnt[li] (number of i >=1 where Z[i] >=li) plus 1 (for i=0 if li <=n).

Thus, the correct count is sum_cnt[li] + 1 (if li <=n).

For example, in "AAA" for li=3:

sum_cnt[3] is the number of i>=1 where Z[i] >=3. Z[1]=2, Z[2]=1. None. So sum_cnt[3]=0. Add 1 (i=0) → count is 1.

For li=2:

sum_cnt[2] is the number of i>=1 where Z[i] >=2. Z[1]=2 → count 1. Add 1 (i=0's occurrence if li=2 <=3 → yes). Total count 1+1=2.

For li=1:

sum_cnt[1] is the number of i>=1 where Z[i] >=1. Z[1] >=1 → yes, Z[2] >=1 → yes. Count 2. Add 1 → 3.

So the correct count is sum_cnt[li] + (1 if li <=n else 0).

So the algorithm should be:

count = sum_cnt[li] + (1 if li <= len(s) else 0).

But since li is a prefix length, li ranges from 1 to len(s). So for all candidate li's, the count is sum_cnt[li] + 1.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute all candidate li's using KMP failure function.

2. Compute the Z-array for the string s.

3. Compute sum_cnt for each li, which is the number of i>=1 with Z[i] >=li.

4. For each candidate li, the count is sum_cnt[li] + 1.

This way, the count includes the occurrence at i=0 (the prefix itself) and any other occurrences in the string.

Now, this approach is O(n) time, which is feasible.

So, to implement this:

First, the KMP failure function to find the candidates.

Then, compute the Z-array.

Then, compute sum_cnt as the suffix sum of frequencies of Z-values >= li.

Now, putting it all together.

For the candidates, after finding all li's using KMP failure function, we need to collect them, sort them, and for each, compute count = sum_cnt[li] +1.

Now, let's test this with the sample input.

Sample input 1: ABACABA.

The candidates are li=1,3,7.

For each:

li=1: count is sum_cnt[1]+1.

What is sum_cnt[1]?

It's the number of i>=1 where Z[i] >=1.

In ABACABA:

The Z-array needs to be computed.

But let's not compute it manually now. Let's assume that the code correctly computes sum_cnt[1] = 3 (since the prefix 'A' occurs 3 times in positions i>=1). Adding 1 gives 4, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for li=3, sum_cnt[3] is 1, plus 1 gives 2. Which matches.

For li=7, sum_cnt[7] is 0, plus 1 gives 1.

So the approach works.

Sample input 2: AAA.

Candidates are 1,2,3.

For li=1: sum_cnt[1] is 2 (Z[1] >=1 and Z[2] >=1), count=2+1=3.

For li=2: sum_cnt[2] is 1 (Z[1] >=2), count=1+1=2.

For li=3: sum_cnt[3] is 0, count=0+1=1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, to implement this in Python.

First, compute the KMP failure function.

Then, collect the candidate li's by backtracking from the last failure function value.

Then, compute the Z-array.

Then, compute the frequency array and sum_cnt.

Then, for each candidate li, calculate count = sum_cnt.get(li, 0) + 1.

Finally, sort the candidates and output.

Now, let's code this.

First, the KMP failure function.

The failure function for a string s is an array pi of length n where pi[i] is the length of the longest prefix of s[0..i] which is also a suffix.

For example, for s = "ABACABA", pi[6] =3.

To compute it:

n = len(s)

pi = [0]*n

for i in 1 to n-1:

    j = pi[i-1]

    while j>0 and s[i] != s[j]:

        j = pi[j-1]

    if s[i] == s[j]:

        j +=1

    pi[i] =j

Thus, the code.

Then, collect the candidates by starting at j = pi[-1], adding j to the list, then j = pi[j-1], and so on until j is 0. Then, add the full length n.

But wait, the full length is always a candidate, since the prefix of length n is equal to the suffix of length n.

For example, in the first sample, the full length is 7, which is included.

But when backtracking from pi[-1], which is 3, then 3's pi is 1, then 1's pi is 0. So the collected candidates are 3, 1, and then we add 7.

So the code is:

candidates = set()

j = pi[-1]

while j >0:

    candidates.add(j)

    j = pi[j-1]

candidates.add(n)

Then, sort the candidates in increasing order.

Wait, but the sample input 1 includes 1,3,7. In the code above, after backtracking, j starts as 3 (pi[-1] for ABACABA is 3). Then candidates.add(3), then j=pi[3-1] = pi[2] (the value at index 2). For ABACABA, the pi array is:

Index 0: 0

Index 1:0 (s[1] is B, s[0] is A)

Index 2:1 (s[2] is A, matches s[0])

Index3:0 (s[3] is C, no match)

Index4:0 (s[4] is A, no match)

Index5:1 (s[5] is B, matches s[0])

Index6:3 (s[6] is A, matches up to 3).

So pi[6] =3.

Then, j=3. Add 3 to candidates.

Then j=pi[2] =1. Add 1.

Then j=pi[0] =0. Loop ends.

Then, add n=7.

Thus, candidates are {3,1,7}, which sorted becomes [1,3,7].

Thus, the code is:

n = len(s)

pi = [0]*n

for i in range(1, n):

    j = pi[i-1]

    while j >0 and s[i] != s[j]:

        j = pi[j-1]

    if s[i] == s[j]:

        j +=1

    pi[i] =j

candidates = set()

j = pi[-1]

while j >0:

    candidates.add(j)

    j = pi[j-1]

candidates.add(n)

sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates)

Then, compute the Z-array.

n = len(s)

Z = [0]*n

l, r =0,0

for i in range(1, n):

    if i > r:

        l = r =i

        while r <n and s[r-l] == s[r]:

            r +=1

        Z[i] = r -l

        r -=1

    else:

        k = i -l

        if Z[k] < r -i +1:

            Z[i] = Z[k]

        else:

            l =i

            while r <n and s[r -l] == s[r]:

                r +=1

            Z[i] = r -l

            r -=1

Then, compute the frequency array and sum_cnt.

max_li = n

freq = [0]*(max_li +2)

for z in Z:

    if z >0:

        if z > max_li:

            freq[max_li] +=1

        else:

            freq[z] +=1

sum_cnt = [0]*(max_li +2)

sum_cnt[max_li] = freq[max_li]

for li in range(max_li-1, 0, -1):

    sum_cnt[li] = sum_cnt[li+1] + freq[li]

Then, for each candidate li in sorted_candidates:

count = sum_cnt[li] +1 if li <=n else 0

But since li is a candidate and <=n, it's count = sum_cnt[li] +1.

Putting it all together:

Read s.

Compute KMP pi array.

Collect candidates.

Compute Z-array.

Compute sum_cnt.

For each candidate, compute count.

Sort candidates.

Sample input 2: AAA.

Z-array is [0,2,1].

For i>=1, Z[1]=2, Z[2]=1.

sum_cnt[1] =2 (both Z[1] >=1 and Z[2] >=1).

count=2+1=3.

sum_cnt[2] =1 (Z[1] >=2).

count=1+1=2.

sum_cnt[3] =0. count=0+1=1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, the code in Python:

Read s.

Compute KMP pi.

Collect candidates.

Compute Z-array.

Compute sum_cnt.

For each candidate, compute count.

Sort and output.

Now, the code.
