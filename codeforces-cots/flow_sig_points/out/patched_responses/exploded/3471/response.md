Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.

So Magnus has four n x n chessboard pieces. These pieces can't be rotated or flipped, but they can be arranged in any position (like moving them around) to form a 2n x 2n chessboard. The goal is to recolor the minimum number of squares so that when the pieces are arranged, they form a valid chessboard. A valid chessboard has each square different from its adjacent (side) neighbors. Also, the pieces must be placed without rotation or flipping.

The key points here are:

1. The four pieces must be placed in the four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) of the 2n x 2n board. Each piece is placed as is, possibly in any of the four positions, but without rotation or flipping. So the order of the pieces is a permutation of the four, assigned to the four quadrants.

2. For each possible arrangement of the four pieces into the quadrants, we need to check how many squares need to be recolored so that the entire board is a valid chessboard. Then, find the arrangement with the minimal total recolors.

3. The valid chessboard can start with either 0 or 1 in the top-left corner. Because the chessboard must alternate colors. For example, the top-left is 0, then the next cell to the right is 1, down is 1, etc. Or top-left is 1, then alternates. So for each arrangement of the pieces into quadrants, we need to consider both possible starting colors and compute the required changes.

So the steps I need to take are:

First, for each of the four pieces, precompute the cost (number of changes needed) for each possible top-left color (0 or 1) and each possible position in the four quadrants. Wait, maybe not. Because the position of the piece in the quadrant affects what the starting color should be for that piece. For example, if the entire chessboard starts with color 0, then each quadrant's top-left corner's expected color depends on where that quadrant is placed.

Wait, the entire chessboard's top-left corner is the top-left of the top-left quadrant. So the top-left quadrant's top-left corner is the same as the entire board's starting color. Then, the top-right quadrant's top-left corner must be the opposite of the top-left quadrant's top-right cell. Because the entire board's first row alternates. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think about the structure.

The entire board is 2n x 2n. Each quadrant is n x n. So for example, the top-left quadrant's cells are in positions (i, j) where 0 <= i < n, 0 <= j < n. The top-right quadrant is (0 <= i <n, n <= j < 2n). The bottom-left is (n <=i <2n, 0 <=j <n), and bottom-right is (n <=i <2n, n <=j <2n).

The entire chessboard must have each cell's color different from adjacent cells. So the starting color (0 or 1) at (0,0) determines the entire pattern.

The pattern alternates rows and columns. So for any cell (i,j), the color is (i + j) mod 2. Wait, no. Wait, if the starting color is 0, then cell (i,j) should be (i + j) % 2. If starting with 1, then it's (i + j + 1) % 2. So for each possible starting color (s = 0 or 1), each cell (i,j) in the entire board must be (s + i + j) % 2.

But each quadrant is a separate piece. So for each quadrant's position in the big board, the expected color for each cell in the quadrant depends on the quadrant's position. For example, the top-left quadrant's cells (x, y) in their own n x n grid correspond to (x, y) in the big board. So for the starting color s, the expected color at (x, y) in the quadrant (when placed in the top-left position) is (s + x + y) % 2.

Similarly, if the quadrant is placed in the top-right position, then in the big board, their coordinates are (x, y + n), so the expected color is (s + x + (y + n)) % 2. Which simplifies to (s + x + y + n) % 2. But since n is odd, adding n mod 2 is 1. So (s + x + y + 1) % 2. So the expected color for the quadrant's cells in the top-right position is (s + x + y + 1) % 2.

Similarly for the bottom-left quadrant, their coordinates are (x + n, y) in the big board. So expected color is (s + x + n + y) % 2. Again, since n is odd, (s + x + y + 1) mod 2.

And the bottom-right quadrant's cells are (x + n, y +n) in the big board. So (s + x + n + y + n) mod 2. n is even, so adding 2n mod 2 is 0. So (s + x + y) mod 2. Wait, but n is odd. So (x + n) is x + odd, and same for y. So (x +n) + (y +n) = x + y + 2n. Which mod 2 is x + y. So the expected color is (s + x + y) mod 2 again. Wait, but this depends on the position of the quadrant in the big board.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model each quadrant's position and compute the expected pattern for each possible starting color.

Let me think for each of the four quadrants:

Quadrant positions:

1. Top-left (TL): the quadrant is in the top-left part. Its cells (i,j) in the quadrant correspond to (i, j) in the big board. Expected color: (s + i + j) % 2.

2. Top-right (TR): cells (i,j) in quadrant correspond to (i, j + n) in big. So expected color: (s + i + (j + n)) % 2. Since n is odd, (j +n) mod 2 = (j +1) mod 2. So this becomes (s + i + j + 1) mod 2.

3. Bottom-left (BL): cells (i,j) in quadrant correspond to (i +n, j) in big. Expected color: (s + (i +n) + j) mod 2. i +n mod 2 is i +1, so (s + i +1 + j) mod 2 = (s +i +j +1) mod 2.

4. Bottom-right (BR): cells (i,j) in quadrant correspond to (i +n, j +n) in big. So expected color is (s + (i +n) + (j +n)) mod 2. i +n +j +n = i +j + 2n. 2n is even, so mod 2 is i +j. So expected color is (s + i +j) mod 2.

Wait, this is interesting. The TL and BR quadrants, when placed in their respective positions, have the same expected pattern (based on their own (i,j) in the quadrant) as (s + i +j) mod 2. But the TR and BL quadrants, when placed in their positions, have expected patterns (s + i +j +1) mod 2.

So for each quadrant, depending on which position (TL, TR, BL, BR) it is placed in, the expected color for each cell (i,j) in the quadrant is either (s + i + j) % 2 or (s + i + j +1) % 2. Wait, but the position affects this.

So for example, a quadrant placed in TR or BL position will have their expected color per cell as (s + i + j +1) mod 2. And those placed in TL or BR positions have (s + i +j) mod 2.

Therefore, for each of the four pieces, when assigned to a quadrant position (TL, TR, BL, BR), we can precompute for each possible starting color (s=0 or s=1) the cost (number of cells that need to be flipped) for that piece in that position and that starting s.

So for each piece, and each possible position (TL, TR, BL, BR), and each starting s (0 or 1), compute the cost.

But how? Let's see.

Each piece has a grid of 0s and 1s. Let's take a piece, say piece k, which is one of the four input pieces. Suppose we want to place it in the TR position. For a given starting s, the expected color for each cell (i,j) in the piece is (s + i + j +1) mod 2. So for each cell (i,j) in the piece, compare the actual value to this expected value. The cost is the sum of mismatches. Similarly for other positions.

So for each piece, and each of the four possible positions (TL, TR, BL, BR), and each s (0 or 1), compute the cost.

But since the starting s is the same for the entire chessboard, when combining all four pieces into the big board, all four pieces must be considered under the same s. So for each possible permutation of the four pieces into the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR), and for each possible s (0 or 1), sum the costs for each piece in their assigned position and s. Then, the minimal total cost over all permutations and s values is the answer.

So the approach is:

1. Precompute for each of the four pieces, the cost when placed in each of the four possible positions (TL, TR, BL, BR), for both s=0 and s=1.

But wait, for a given s and position, the cost for a piece is the number of cells that need to change. So for each piece, for each possible position (TL, TR, BL, BR), and s=0 or 1, compute the cost.

Wait, but the position determines the expected pattern. For example, for position TL, the expected color is (s + i + j) mod 2. For position TR, it's (s + i + j +1) mod 2. So for a given s, the cost for a piece in TR position is computed as the sum over all cells in the piece where the cell's value differs from (s + i + j +1) mod 2. Similarly for other positions.

So, for each piece, we can precompute for each possible position (four positions) and for each s (two values), the cost. But how?

Wait, for position TL:

expected = (s + i + j) % 2

for position TR:

expected = (s + i + j + 1) % 2

for position BL:

expected = (s + i + j + 1) % 2

for position BR:

expected = (s + i + j) % 2

So, the position TL and BR have the same expected pattern for a given s, while TR and BL have the same. So perhaps for each position, the expected pattern can be determined by which 'type' (A or B) the position is. For example:

Type A positions are TL and BR. For these, the expected is (s + i + j) mod 2.

Type B positions are TR and BL. For these, the expected is (s + i + j +1) mod 2.

So for each piece and for each possible position, compute for s=0 and s=1, the cost.

Alternatively, for each piece and each type (A or B), compute for s=0 and s=1 the cost. Because positions TL and BR are type A, TR and BL are type B.

But since each permutation assigns the four pieces to the four positions (each position exactly once), perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

The four pieces need to be assigned to the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR). For each possible permutation of the four pieces into these positions, and for each s (0 or 1), compute the sum of the costs for each piece in their assigned position and s.

The minimal sum over all permutations and s is the answer.

But how do we compute the cost for each piece in a position and s?

Let's think for a permutation where the pieces are assigned as follows:

- piece0 → TL (type A)
- piece1 → TR (type B)
- piece2 → BL (type B)
- piece3 → BR (type A)

Then, for a given s, the cost for each piece is:

piece0: sum over all cells (i,j) of (piece0[i][j] != (s + i + j) % 2 )

piece1: sum over cells (i,j) of (piece1[i][j] != (s + i + j + 1) % 2 )

piece2: sum over cells (i,j) of (piece2[i][j] != (s + i + j + 1) % 2 )

piece3: sum over cells (i,j) of (piece3[i][j] != (s + i + j) % 2 )

Then, the total cost is the sum of these four.

So the key is, for each piece, and for each possible position type (A or B) and s, compute the cost.

But each position in the permutation has a type (A or B). So for each piece and each permutation, when placed in a position of type A or B, compute the cost for s=0 and s=1.

Wait, but for a given permutation, the positions are fixed. For example, in the permutation, the first piece is in TL (type A), the second in TR (type B), third in BL (type B), fourth in BR (type A). So, for each piece in the permutation, their position's type is determined.

So, for each permutation of the four pieces (since all four are used), and for each s in 0,1, compute the total cost by checking for each piece, based on their position's type (A or B), what the cost is for s.

So the problem reduces to:

- Precompute for each piece, for each of the two types (A and B), the cost when s is 0 and when s is 1.

Then, for each permutation of the four pieces (so all 4! permutations), and for each s (0 and 1), sum the cost for each piece in their assigned position's type and s.

The minimal sum across all permutations and s is the answer.

Wait, but the permutation determines which piece is assigned to which position. Each position has a type (A or B). For example:

Positions:

- TL: type A
- TR: type B
- BL: type B
- BR: type A

So in the permutation, the four pieces are assigned to these four positions. So each piece's position in the permutation determines the type (A or B) of their position. For example, if a piece is assigned to the TR position (type B), then we use the cost for that piece when it's placed in a type B position.

Thus, for each permutation, the order of the four pieces corresponds to their assignment to the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR). Each of these positions has a type (A or B), so for each piece in the permutation, we need to look up the cost for that type (A or B) and the current s.

So, for each piece, we need to precompute two values for s=0 and two for s=1:

- costA0: cost when the piece is in a type A position (TL or BR) and s=0.

- costA1: cost when the piece is in type A position and s=1.

- costB0: cost when in type B position (TR or BL) and s=0.

- costB1: cost when in type B position and s=1.

Once we have these precomputed for each piece, then for any permutation and s, we can calculate the total cost by summing the appropriate costs for each piece's position type and s.

For example, in a permutation where the first piece is in TL (type A), the second in TR (type B), third in BL (type B), fourth in BR (type A), then for s=0, the total cost is:

piece0's costA0 + piece1's costB0 + piece2's costB0 + piece3's costA0.

Similarly for s=1, sum costA1, costB1, costB1, costA1.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each of the four pieces, the four cost values: costA0, costA1, costB0, costB1.

2. Generate all possible permutations of the four pieces (since each piece must be assigned to exactly one of the four positions). There are 4! = 24 permutations.

3. For each permutation, and for each s (0 and 1), compute the sum of the costs for each piece based on their position's type (A or B) and s.

4. Find the minimal total cost across all permutations and s values.

Now, how to precompute the costA0, etc. for each piece.

For a given piece, which is a n x n grid.

For costA0: the cost when the piece is in a type A position (TL or BR) and s=0. So the expected color for each cell (i,j) is (0 + i + j) mod 2. So for each cell in the piece, if the actual value is not equal to (i+j) mod 2, add 1 to the cost.

Similarly, costA1 is when s=1. Expected color is (1 + i + j) mod 2.

For costB0: in type B position (TR or BL), s=0. Expected color is (0 + i + j +1) mod 2 → (i + j +1) mod 2.

costB1: s=1, type B → (1 + i + j +1) mod 2 = (i + j + 2) mod 2 → (i +j) mod 2.

Wait, let's recheck:

For type B position and s=0: expected color is (s + i + j +1) mod 2 → (0 + i +j +1) mod 2 → (i+j+1) mod 2.

For s=1 and type B: (1 + i +j +1) mod 2 → (i +j +2) mod 2 → (i +j) mod 2.

So for each cell (i,j) in the piece, the expected color depends on type and s.

Thus, for each piece, we can precompute these four costs:

costA0 = sum over all cells (i,j) in piece: (cell != (i + j) % 2)

costA1 = sum over all cells: (cell != (1 + i + j) % 2 )

costB0 = sum over all cells: (cell != (i +j + 1) % 2 )

costB1 = sum over all cells: (cell != (i +j) % 2 )

Wait, for costB1, (s=1 and type B), expected is (1 + i + j +1) mod 2 → (i +j +2) mod 2 → (i +j) mod 2. So same as (i +j) mod 2.

So for costB1, the expected color is (i + j) mod 2. So the same as costA0.

So for each piece, the four costs can be computed as:

costA0: sum( cell != (i+j) % 2 )

costA1: sum( cell != (i+j +1) % 2 )

costB0: sum( cell != (i+j +1) % 2 )

costB1: sum( cell != (i+j) % 2 )

Wait, that's interesting. So costA0 is the same as costB1. And costA1 is the same as costB0.

Because:

costB0: s=0, type B → (i+j+1) mod 2. Which is same as costA1 (s=1, type A → (1 + i +j) mod 2 → same as i+j+1 mod 2).

Similarly, costB1 (s=1, type B) → (1 + i +j +1) mod 2 → (i+j) mod 2, which is same as costA0.

So for each piece, the four costs can be reduced to two values: cost when expected is (i+j) mod 2 (call this cost0), and when expected is (i+j+1) mod 2 (call this cost1). Then:

costA0 = cost0

costA1 = cost1

costB0 = cost1

costB1 = cost0

So for each piece, we can compute cost0 and cost1. Then, when the piece is in a type A position and s=0 → cost0. If s=1 → cost1. If in type B position and s=0 → cost1. s=1 → cost0.

So for each piece, precompute cost0 and cost1.

Therefore, for each permutation of the four pieces into the four positions, which have types (A, B, B, A), and for each s in 0 and 1, the total cost can be computed as follows:

For each piece in the permutation:

- if the position is type A (TL or BR), then add cost0 for s=0, cost1 for s=1.

Wait, no. Because for the position type A, the expected is (s + i + j) mod 2. So for s=0, expected is (i+j) mod 2 → cost0. For s=1, expected is (i +j +1) mod 2 → cost1.

But for the position type B, the expected is (s + i + j +1) mod 2. So when s=0, expected is (i +j +1) mod 2 → cost1. When s=1, expected is (i + j + 2) mod 2 → (i +j) mod 2 → cost0.

So for each piece in the permutation, depending on the position's type and s, the cost is:

if position is type A:

- s=0: cost0

- s=1: cost1

if position is type B:

- s=0: cost1

- s=1: cost0

Therefore, for a permutation [p0, p1, p2, p3] assigned to positions [TL (A), TR (B), BL (B), BR (A)], then for each s (0 or 1), the total cost is:

p0's cost (A, s) + p1's cost (B, s) + p2's cost (B, s) + p3's cost (A, s)

Which for each s is:

if s=0:

p0.cost0 + p1.cost1 + p2.cost1 + p3.cost0

if s=1:

p0.cost1 + p1.cost0 + p2.cost0 + p3.cost1

So for each permutation, the sum for s=0 and s=1 can be computed based on the positions' types and s.

But since the positions' types are fixed as [A, B, B, A], perhaps we can precompute for each permutation (each possible order of the four pieces) the required cost for s=0 and s=1.

So the steps are:

1. Read the four chessboard pieces.

2. For each piece, compute cost0 and cost1. cost0 is the number of cells that are not equal to (i + j) mod 2. cost1 is the number of cells not equal to (i + j +1) mod 2.

3. Generate all permutations of the four pieces. For each permutation (which represents assigning each piece to one of the four positions in order [TL, TR, BL, BR], which have types [A, B, B, A]), compute the total cost for s=0 and s=1.

For each permutation (p0, p1, p2, p3):

sum_s0 = p0.cost0 + p1.cost1 + p2.cost1 + p3.cost0

sum_s1 = p0.cost1 + p1.cost0 + p2.cost0 + p3.cost1

The minimal of sum_s0 and sum_s1 for this permutation is added to the possible candidates.

The overall answer is the minimal such sum across all permutations and s values.

So the approach is to generate all 4! permutations of the four pieces, and for each permutation compute sum for s=0 and s=1, then take the minimal of those two, then find the overall minimal.

But wait, the permutations are all possible orderings of the four pieces. Because each piece must be assigned to exactly one position. So for example, the four pieces are [A, B, C, D], and each permutation represents a unique assignment to the four positions.

Yes. Since all four pieces must be used, and each is used exactly once.

So the code plan is:

- Read n.

- Read four pieces. Each piece is a list of n strings, each string of n characters (0 or 1). But how to read them? The input has four segments, each separated by an empty line. So for each piece, read n lines, then an empty line (except perhaps after the last piece). But in the input, after the fourth piece, there's no empty line. So the code must read four pieces, each consisting of n lines, possibly with empty lines between them. But how to parse this?

In Python, we can read all lines first, split them into groups separated by empty lines. Then take the first four groups (each group is a piece's n lines). Each group's lines are the rows of the piece.

So code steps:

Read all lines from input, stripping whitespace (but for the input, the lines are n characters, each either 0 or 1, possibly with newlines in between. But the problem says that each piece is separated by an empty line. So the input is:

n

piece1 line 1

piece1 line 2

...

piece1 line n

(empty line)

piece2 line 1

... etc.

But how to read them correctly? So perhaps read all the input, split into blocks separated by empty lines. The first line is n. Then the next four blocks are the four pieces. Each block has n lines of n characters.

Wait, the first line is n. Then there are four segments (the four pieces) each consisting of n lines. The problem states that the segments are separated by empty lines. So after the first line (n), there are four segments, each is n lines, and between segments (but not before the first or after the last) there's an empty line.

So for example, the input for n=1 would have:

1

0

0

1

0

Which is:

n=1, then four pieces. The first piece is "0", the second is "0", the third is "1", the fourth is "0". No empty lines here. Wait, but the problem statement's first example shows input:

1

0

0

1

0

So the first line is 1. Then four pieces, each with 1 line, and no empty lines in between. So perhaps when n=1, the four pieces are each read as one line, no empty lines. So the input may or may not have empty lines between the pieces. Wait, the problem says that the segments are separated by an empty line. So in the input, after each of the first three pieces, there's an empty line. The fourth piece is followed by whatever comes next (but nothing, as the input ends).

But the first example shows that the input has four pieces each with one line, and no empty lines. But according to the problem statement, the four segments are separated by empty lines. So perhaps the first example is formatted incorrectly. Wait, looking back:

First example's input:

1

0

0

1

0

But according to the problem statement, each of the four pieces is separated by an empty line. So the correct input would have:

1

0

(blank line)

0

(blank line)

1

(blank line)

0

But the first example's input has no blank lines. Hmm, perhaps the problem's first example is a formatting error, but according to the problem statement, the segments are separated by empty lines. So perhaps the code should read the four pieces, each with n lines, separated by empty lines. So the code must read n, then read four groups, each consisting of n lines, with empty lines between groups.

Thus, in Python, we can read all lines, split them into groups separated by empty lines. The first line is n. Then the next four groups (each with n lines) are the four pieces.

So code steps:

Read all lines from input, stripping whitespace. Then, the first line is n. Then, the remaining lines are grouped into four groups, each group being n lines. The groups are separated by empty lines.

So, in Python:

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]

n = int(lines[0])

pieces = []

current = 1

for _ in range(4):

    piece = lines[current:current + n]

    pieces.append(piece)

    current += n

But wait, this assumes that after the first line (n), the next four pieces are each n lines, with no empty lines. But according to the problem statement, there are empty lines between pieces. So perhaps the lines after the first line (n) may have empty lines, and the code needs to split the lines into four groups, each consisting of exactly n lines, with any number of empty lines between groups.

In that case, the code would need to read all lines after the first, and split them into four groups, each group being n lines, ignoring any empty lines. So the code would:

After reading n, process the remaining lines (excluding empty ones) into a list. Then, take the first 4*n lines (since each piece has n lines). Then split into four groups of n lines each.

Wait, because if there are empty lines between the pieces, the code would have already stripped them out. So for example, the input for the first example would have:

n=1, then lines after are ['0','0','1','0'], which is four lines. Then split into four groups of 1 line each. So the code would read:

piece1: ['0']

piece2: ['0']

piece3: ['1']

piece4: ['0']

Yes. For the second example, the input after n=3 is 4 pieces, each 3 lines. So lines after n=3 are 3 lines (piece1), possibly followed by empty lines, then 3 lines (piece2), etc. After stripping empty lines, the lines would be 4*3=12 lines. So the code can split into four groups of 3 lines each.

Thus, the code can read n, then read the next 4*n lines (ignoring empty lines), split into four groups of n lines each.

Thus:

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]

n = int(lines[0])

current = 1

pieces = []

for i in range(4):

    start = current + i * n

    end = start + n

    piece = lines[start:end]

    pieces.append(piece)

Wait, no. Because current is 1 (the first line after n). For each of the four pieces, each has n lines. So the code would:

current = 1

for _ in range(4):

    piece = lines[current:current +n]

    pieces.append(piece)

    current +=n

Yes. So this code would work, regardless of empty lines in the input, since the lines list has stripped out all empty lines.

So, once the pieces are read, for each piece, we compute cost0 and cost1.

For each piece in pieces:

cost0 is the number of cells (i,j) where the cell's value != (i + j) % 2.

cost1 is the number of cells (i,j) where the cell's value != (i + j +1) % 2.

So for each cell in the piece's grid:

for i in 0 to n-1:

    for j in 0 to n-1:

        cell_value = int(piece[i][j])

        expected0 = (i + j) % 2

        expected1 = (i + j + 1) % 2

        cost0 += (cell_value != expected0)

        cost1 += (cell_value != expected1)

Once cost0 and cost1 are computed for all four pieces, the next step is to generate all permutations of the four pieces, and for each permutation, compute the sum_s0 and sum_s1.

Each permutation is a rearrangement of the four pieces, each used exactly once.

In Python, we can use itertools.permutations(pieces) to generate all possible permutations. However, since pieces is a list of four elements, permutations will generate all 4! = 24 possible orderings. For each permutation, the four pieces are assigned to the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR) in that order.

But wait, the permutations are generated as all possible orderings of the four elements. Each permutation is a tuple of the four pieces, each in a different order. For example, (p0, p1, p2, p3) is a permutation where:

p0 is assigned to TL (type A),

p1 to TR (type B),

p2 to BL (type B),

p3 to BR (type A).

So for each permutation in permutations(pieces), compute:

sum_s0 = perm[0].cost0 + perm[1].cost1 + perm[2].cost1 + perm[3].cost0

sum_s1 = perm[0].cost1 + perm[1].cost0 + perm[2].cost0 + perm[3].cost1

Then, the minimal between sum_s0 and sum_s1 for this permutation is a candidate for the answer. We need to track the minimal overall.

So for each permutation, the minimal is min(sum_s0, sum_s1), and we need the overall minimal across all permutations and their minimal s.

Wait, no. Because for each permutation, we can choose to use either s=0 or s=1, whichever gives the lower sum. So for each permutation, the minimal sum is min(sum_s0, sum_s1). Then, the overall answer is the minimal of all those minimal sums across all permutations.

Alternatively, for each permutation and s in {0, 1}, compute the sum and keep track of the global minimal.

But in code, it's more efficient to compute both sum_s0 and sum_s1 for each permutation, then take the minimal of the two, and keep the overall minimal.

So the code will loop through all permutations, compute sum_s0 and sum_s1, then take the minimal of those two for each permutation, and keep track of the global minimum.

Now, the code steps:

Read the four pieces.

Precompute for each piece, cost0 and cost1.

Generate all permutations of the four pieces.

For each permutation:

   p0, p1, p2, p3 = permutation

   sum_s0 = p0.cost0 + p1.cost1 + p2.cost1 + p3.cost0

   sum_s1 = p0.cost1 + p1.cost0 + p2.cost0 + p3.cost1

   current_min = min(sum_s0, sum_s1)

   if current_min < global_min:

       global_min = current_min

Once all permutations are processed, output global_min.

So the code's structure is:

import itertools

n = int(input())

pieces = []

# Read the four pieces

for _ in range(4):

    piece = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

    # Skip any empty lines between pieces, but input().strip() will handle that as empty lines are skipped.

    # Wait, no. Because between pieces there are empty lines, but when using input().strip(), lines that are empty (after stripping) will be skipped. So this code may not read the pieces correctly if the input has empty lines between them.

Wait, this is a problem. Because when reading the input line by line, using input().strip(), the code may read the pieces incorrectly if there are empty lines between the pieces.

For example, the input for the first example is:

1

0

0

1

0

After the first line (n=1), the next four lines are the four pieces (each of length 1). But if between the pieces there are empty lines, the code that reads for each piece, n lines, may read incorrect lines.

So the previous code, which uses input().strip() and assumes that the empty lines are skipped, is incorrect.

Thus, the correct way is to read all lines, stripping whitespace, ignoring empty lines, then process them.

So:

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]

n = int(lines[0])

current = 1

pieces = []

for _ in range(4):

    piece = lines[current:current + n]

    pieces.append(piece)

    current +=n

Yes, because after the first line (n=...), the next lines are the four pieces, each n lines. Any empty lines in between are ignored because the lines list is built by filtering out empty lines.

So in code:

import sys

from itertools import permutations

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]

n = int(lines[0])

current = 1

pieces = []

for _ in range(4):

    piece = lines[current:current + n]

    pieces.append(piece)

    current += n

Then, for each piece in pieces, compute cost0 and cost1.

So for each piece in pieces:

cost0 = 0

cost1 = 0

for i in range(n):

    row = piece[i]

    for j in range(n):

        cell = int(row[j])

        expected0 = (i + j) % 2

        expected1 = (i + j + 1) % 2

        cost0 += (cell != expected0)

        cost1 += (cell != expected1)

Store these cost0 and cost1 for each piece.

So, create a list of tuples, one for each piece, containing (cost0, cost1).

precomputed = []

for piece in pieces:

    c0 = 0

    c1 = 0

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            cell = int(piece[i][j])

            e0 = (i + j) % 2

            e1 = (i + j + 1) % 2

            if cell != e0:

                c0 +=1

            if cell != e1:

                c1 +=1

    precomputed.append( (c0, c1) )

Then, generate all permutations of the four pieces' indices (0-3), and for each permutation, sum the costs.

But wait, permutations(pieces) gives all possible orderings of the four pieces. But since the precomputed list has the costs for each piece, when we permute the pieces, we need to get their precomputed cost0 and cost1.

Wait, no. The precomputed list is in the same order as the pieces list. So for each piece in the permutation (which is a list of strings), we can find its index in the original pieces list, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, no. The permutations are generated from the list of pieces. Each element in the permutation is one of the four pieces (the list of strings). So in code, when you generate permutations(pieces), each element is a reference to the original piece. But the precomputed list is for each piece in the original order. So for a permutation (p0, p1, p2, p3), each p is a piece (list of strings). So to get their cost0 and cost1, we need to find the index of p in the original pieces list. But this is not reliable, as pieces can be duplicated. Wait, but according to the problem statement, each piece is distinct. But in code, the pieces are read as separate elements. So when you generate permutations, each permutation is an ordering of the four elements in the pieces list. So for each piece in the permutation, its index in the original pieces list can be found as pieces.index(p), but that could be error-prone if two pieces are identical. But the problem allows that, so code must handle it.

But in Python, when you have a list of objects (like the pieces, which are lists), the permutations will generate tuples where each element is one of the elements of the original list. So for example, if the original list is [A, B, C, D], then permutations will generate all orderings of these four elements.

Thus, for each permutation in permutations(pieces), the elements are the same as in the pieces list. So the precomputed list for each piece is ordered in the same way as the pieces list. So for a permutation [p0, p1, p2, p3], each p is a piece from the original pieces list, and its index in the pieces list is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. So the precomputed costs for each p can be obtained by finding the index of p in the original pieces list, and then accessing precomputed[index].

But how to do that efficiently? Because the permutations are generated from the pieces list, which is a list of piece objects. Each element in a permutation is one of the original pieces. So for example, if the original pieces list is [pieceA, pieceB, pieceC, pieceD], then a permutation (pieceB, pieceA, pieceD, pieceC) is generated. So for each piece in the permutation, we can find its original index in the pieces list (e.g., pieceB is at index 1). Then, precomputed[1] gives its (cost0, cost1).

But how to find the index? We can use the list's index method. But since the piece is a list of strings (each piece is a list of n strings), and lists are compared by reference, not by content. So if two pieces have the same content, but are different lists, then pieces.index(p) would not find the correct one. But in the problem, each piece is read as a separate list, so even if two pieces have the same content, they are different lists, and their indices would be different. But the problem allows that, so the code would treat them as distinct pieces. But the problem states that the input may have four pieces with varying content, but they are distinct.

But the code must work regardless of whether the pieces are same or different. So in code, when generating the permutation, each element is a reference to one of the four original pieces (each being a list of strings). So for each element in the permutation, we can find its index in the original pieces list with pieces.index(p), but this would take O(n) time per lookup, which is acceptable given that n is up to 100 and there are only 4 elements.

Alternatively, we can precompute a list of the precomputed costs, and for each permutation, get the costs by the original indices. Wait, but permutations are generated as the actual piece objects. So perhaps a better approach is to precompute a dictionary that maps each piece (as a tuple of its rows) to its (cost0, cost1). But since the piece is a list of strings, which are not hashable, we can convert each piece to a tuple of tuples, and use that as the key.

Alternatively, since each piece is in the pieces list, and their order is known, we can create a list of (cost0, cost1) for each piece, in the same order as pieces. Then, for a given permutation (p0, p1, p2, p3), each of these is an element in the pieces list, so their index can be determined as pieces.index(p0), etc.

But the index method for lists in Python returns the first occurrence. So if two pieces are identical (same content), this would return the same index. But according to the problem statement, the input has four pieces (even if they are identical), and each must be used exactly once. So the code must treat them as separate pieces, even if their content is the same. However, in Python, if two pieces are identical (same rows), but are stored as separate lists, the index method would not find them. For example:

p0 = ['0']
p1 = ['0']
pieces = [p0, p1, ...]

then pieces.index(p1) would return 0, since p0 and p1 are different objects but have the same content, but in reality, they are different. So this approach is not safe.

Thus, this approach is invalid. Instead, the code must precompute the cost0 and cost1 for each piece when it is read, and associate it with the piece. So perhaps the code should, after reading each piece, compute its cost0 and cost1 and store them along with the piece.

But in Python, the pieces are stored as lists, and when generating permutations, each element is a reference to the original list. So it's better to precompute for each piece the cost0 and cost1 when reading it, and store them in a list.

So the code can be adjusted as follows:

precomp = []  # list of tuples (cost0, cost1) for each piece

for i in range(4):

    piece = pieces[i]

    c0 = 0

    c1 = 0

    for i_row in range(n):

        row = piece[i_row]

        for j_col in range(n):

            cell = int(row[j_col])

            e0 = (i_row + j_col) % 2

            e1 = (i_row + j_col + 1) % 2

            if cell != e0:

                c0 +=1

            if cell != e1:

                c1 +=1

    precomp.append( (c0, c1) )

Then, for each permutation of the four pieces (as lists), the code can find the corresponding index in the original pieces list, and thus retrieve the precomputed costs. But this is not feasible because the permutation is made of the original piece objects (the lists), and the code can't directly find their indices.

Wait, no. The permutation is a tuple of four elements, each being one of the original four piece lists. So the code can generate permutations of indices instead of the actual pieces.

Ah! Instead of generating permutations of the pieces (the lists), generate permutations of the indices (0, 1, 2, 3), and for each permutation of indices, retrieve the precomputed costs for each piece.

This would be more efficient and avoid the problem of comparing lists.

Yes. So the code can generate all permutations of [0, 1, 2, 3], and for each permutation, the order represents the assignment of the four pieces to the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR). For example, permutation (0, 1, 2, 3) means piece0 is assigned to TL, piece1 to TR, etc.

Thus, this approach avoids the need to manage the actual pieces in permutations, and allows us to directly use the precomputed costs via their indices.

This is the correct approach. Because the precomp list is ordered in the same order as the pieces. So for each permutation of indices (a, b, c, d), the code can access precomp[a], precomp[b], precomp[c], precomp[d], and sum their costs according to the position's type.

Thus, the code steps are:

precomp is a list where precomp[i] is the (cost0, cost1) for the i-th piece.

Generate all permutations of the indices [0, 1, 2, 3].

For each permutation (a, b, c, d):

   sum_s0 = precomp[a][0] + precomp[b][1] + precomp[c][1] + precomp[d][0]

   sum_s1 = precomp[a][1] + precomp[b][0] + precomp[c][0] + precomp[d][1]

   current_min = min(sum_s0, sum_s1)

   keep track of the global minimum.

This approach is correct because:

- permutation (a, b, c, d) represents assigning piece a to TL (type A), piece b to TR (type B), piece c to BL (type B), piece d to BR (type A).

- For s=0: TL (type A) uses cost0, TR (type B) uses cost1, BL (type B) uses cost1, BR (type A) uses cost0.

So sum_s0 is precomp[a][0] + precomp[b][1] + precomp[c][1] + precomp[d][0].

- For s=1: TL (type A) uses cost1, TR (type B) uses cost0, BL (type B) uses cost0, BR (type A) uses cost1.

Sum_s1 is precomp[a][1] + precomp[b][0] + precomp[c][0] + precomp[d][1].

This approach is correct and efficient, as permutations of indices are generated, and each permutation can be processed quickly.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

Read the four pieces and compute their cost0 and cost1.

Generate all permutations of [0, 1, 2, 3].

For each permutation, compute sum_s0 and sum_s1.

Keep track of the minimal sum.

Thus, the code:

import sys

from itertools import permutations

lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]

n = int(lines[0])

current = 1

pieces = []

for _ in range(4):

    piece = lines[current:current + n]

    pieces.append(piece)

    current +=n

precomp = []

for piece in pieces:

    cost0 = 0

    cost1 = 0

    for i in range(n):

        row = piece[i]

        for j in range(n):

            cell = int(row[j])

            e0 = (i + j) % 2

            e1 = (i + j + 1) % 2

            if cell != e0:

                cost0 +=1

            if cell != e1:

                cost1 +=1

    precomp.append( (cost0, cost1) )

min_total = float('inf')

for perm in permutations([0,1,2,3]):

    a, b, c, d = perm

    sum_s0 = precomp[a][0] + precomp[b][1] + precomp[c][1] + precomp[d][0]

    sum_s1 = precomp[a][1] + precomp[b][0] + precomp[c][0] + precomp[d][1]

    current_min = min(sum_s0, sum_s1)

    if current_min < min_total:

        min_total = current_min

print(min_total)

This code should handle all cases correctly.

Testing it against the sample inputs:

First sample input:

1

0

0

1

0

The four pieces are:

Piece0: ["0"]

Piece1: ["0"]

Piece2: ["1"]

Piece3: ["0"]

precomp for each piece:

For each piece (n=1), i and j are 0.

For piece0:

cell is 0.

e0 = (0+0) mod 2 = 0 → cell == e0 → cost0 += 0.

e1 = (0+0+1) mod 2 = 1 → cell != e1 → cost1 += 1.

So precomp[0] = (0, 1)

piece1: same as piece0 → precomp[1] = (0, 1)

piece2: cell is 1.

e0 is 0 → 1 != 0 → cost0 +=1.

e1 is 1 → 1 == 1 → cost1 +=0.

precomp[2] = (1, 0)

piece3: cell is 0 → same as piece0: (0,1).

precomp is [ (0,1), (0,1), (1,0), (0,1) ]

Now, permutations of indices [0,1,2,3].

For each permutation, compute sum_s0 and sum_s1.

Looking for the minimal sum.

The correct answer is 1.

Let's see.

For example, permutation (0,1,2,3):

sum_s0 = precomp[0][0] + precomp[1][1] + precomp[2][1] + precomp[3][0] → 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 → 1.

sum_s1 = precomp[0][1] + precomp[1][0] + precomp[2][0] + precomp[3][1] → 1 +0 +1 +1 → 3.

min is 1. So this permutation gives a sum of 1.

But is there such a permutation?

Yes. For example, permutation (0,1,2,3) is one of the permutations, and sum_s0 is 1, which is the correct answer.

Thus, the code would output 1.

Second sample input:

3

101

010

101

101

000

101

010

101

011

010

101

010

This has four pieces. The code should compute the minimal sum.

But given the code's approach, it should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code is correct.
