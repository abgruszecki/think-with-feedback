Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again carefully.

So, the problem is about watering flowers over m days. Each day, the beaver can choose a contiguous segment of w flowers and water them once. Each watering adds 1 to each flower in that segment. The goal is to maximize the minimum height of all flowers after m days. The input gives the initial heights of the flowers. We need to find the maximum possible minimum height.

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key is to find the optimal way to apply the waterings so that the smallest flower ends up as large as possible.

First, the constraints. The maximum n and m are 1e5 each. So any O(nm) algorithm is out of the question. We need something more efficient, like O(n log something) or O(n) with some clever pre-processing.

Wait, binary search! That's a common approach for optimization problems where we want to maximize the minimum or minimize the maximum. So maybe we can binary search on the possible minimum value and check if it's feasible to achieve that value with m waterings.

Yes. So the plan is:

1. Binary search on the possible minimum value (let's call it 'target').
2. For each candidate target, check if it's possible to apply the waterings such that all flowers have at least 'target' height, using no more than m days.

The next question is, how to efficiently perform the check for a given target.

Each flower's initial height is a_i. The required number of additional waterings for the i-th flower is (target - a_i), but if target < a_i, then we can't have that, so the target is invalid. So first, we need to ensure that target is at least the minimum a_i, but during binary search, the lower bound can start at the initial minimum.

Wait, but the initial a_i can be up to 1e9, so when the target is higher than the initial maximum plus m (since each watering can add at most 1 per day to a flower, but not sure exactly how much), but perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be the initial minimum plus m, but maybe higher. Wait, no. Because each day you can water a window of w flowers. So each watering affects w flowers, but each flower can be part of multiple windows. For example, if w is 1, then each day you can water each flower once, so each flower can get m additions. But if w is larger, then the maximum possible for a flower depends on how many windows include it. For example, in the first sample, m=2 days, and w=3. The last 3 flowers were watered once, then maybe other days not used. So the flowers in the window can get 1 each. So for a flower's maximum possible increase is m + (m-1) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the upper bound for the binary search can be the initial minimum a_i plus m + some buffer. Wait, perhaps for the binary search upper limit, the maximum possible target is the initial minimum a_i plus m, but that's not necessarily correct. For example, if a flower can be in multiple windows each day, then theoretically, each day, a window can be chosen such that a particular flower is included. So each day, that flower gets +1. So maximum possible is a_i + m. But that's only possible if w=1, because otherwise you can't select a window of w=1 each day. Wait, no. For example, if w=3, and the flower is in position 2 of a 5-flower row, then the windows could be [1-3], [2-4], [3-5], etc. But if you need to water that flower every day, you can choose a window that includes it each day. So even if w>1, a flower could be watered every day. So the maximum possible for any flower is initial a_i + m, regardless of w. So the upper bound for the binary search can be (min_a + m), but actually, maybe even higher. Wait, no. Because if all m days are used to water a window that includes the flower, then yes. So the upper limit for binary search can be the maximum possible target, which is min(initial a_i) + m, but wait, maybe not. Because if the flower is the minimal one, then to reach the target, the minimal a_i plus the number of waterings applied to it must be >= target. But how many times can a flower be watered? Up to m times. So the upper bound for binary search can be the initial minimum a_i + m. So the binary search can start with low = current_min, high = current_min + m.

So the binary search approach is feasible. Now, how to check for a given target.

For each flower, the required number of times it's watered is (target - a_i) if target > a_i. Otherwise, it's 0. Let's call this required[i] = max(0, target - a_i).

But each watering is a window of w consecutive flowers. So each watering contributes +1 to exactly w flowers.

So the problem reduces to: can we find a sequence of K watering operations (K <= m), such that for each flower i, the number of windows that include it is >= required[i], and K <= m.

Wait, but each watering is a window of w flowers. So each watering adds 1 to exactly w flowers. So the sum of all required[i] must be <= K * w. Because each of the K operations contributes exactly w to the sum. So sum(required) must be <= m * w.

But also, the way the windows are arranged must cover each required[i] exactly. For example, suppose required[i] is 3. Then flower i must be covered by 3 windows. But these windows can be overlapping in any way, as long as each covers i.

But how do we model this? Because the windows can be placed anywhere, but each time you choose a window of w flowers.

So the check function for a given target is:

1. For each i, compute required[i] = max(0, target - a[i]).
2. Check if sum(required) > m * w. If yes, return False.
3. Also, check if any required[i] > m. Because each window can contribute at most 1 to a flower's count. So required[i] can't exceed the number of days m. Because even if you water that flower every day, it can be in m windows. So if any required[i] > m, return False.
4. Then, we need to model how the windows can be arranged to meet the required[i] for each i. But how?

Wait, maybe that's not sufficient. Because even if sum(required) <= m*w and each required[i] <= m, it's possible that the arrangement is impossible. For example, if required is such that some flowers are too spaced apart, and you can't cover them with overlapping windows.

But perhaps those two checks (sum(required) <= m*w and all required[i] <= m) are sufficient. Because even if sum(required) is <= m*w and each required[i] <= m, then maybe there exists a way to arrange the windows.

Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose n=3, w=2. m=2. required = [2, 2, 2]. sum(required) is 6. m*w is 4. 6>4, so it's invalid. So sum check would catch this.

Another example: n=3, w=1. m=3. required = [3,3,3]. sum is 9. m*w is 3*1=3. 9>3. So sum check catches this.

Another example where sum is okay but individual required exceeds m. Let's say required[i] = m+1. Then the check for required[i] <= m would catch it.

So the two conditions (sum <= m*w and all required[i] <= m) are necessary. But are they sufficient?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of a case where sum is okay, all required[i] <= m, but arrangement is impossible.

Hmm. For example: n=5, w=3, m=2.

Suppose required is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Sum is 10. m*w is 6. So 10 >6, so sum check fails. So that's not allowed.

Another case: n=4, w=2, m=3. required is [3, 0, 0, 3]. Each required is <=3. sum is 6. m*w is 3*2=6. So sum is okay. But how to arrange the windows. We need to cover the first and fourth elements each 3 times. But each window of size 2. So possible windows:

Day 1: [1,2] → add 1 to first and second.

Day 2: [1,2] → add again. Now first is 2, second is 2.

But the fourth is 3. How can we reach that. Oh, wait, maybe the required here is for the first and fourth to get 3 each. Let's see:

The sum is 3+0+0+3 =6 = m*w=3*2=6. So sum is okay. Each required[i] is <=3.

But can we arrange the windows?

To get 3 on the first, we need to have three windows that include it. Since each window is size 2, the first can be covered by windows [1,2]. So three times that: each time, window is 1-2. Then, each of those three days adds 1 to first. So first would get 3. Then, for the fourth, each window that includes it is either 3-4 or 4-5 (if w=2). So to get 3 on the fourth, we need three windows that include it. But each window is of size 2. So the fourth can be covered by three windows of 3-4 or 4-5. But each such window would require 3 days. So total days would be 3 (for first) + 3 (for fourth) =6 days, but m is 3. So it's impossible.

But according to the sum check, sum is 6 = 3*2, but the arrangement is impossible. So the sum check is not sufficient.

Thus, the two conditions are necessary but not sufficient. So we need a more accurate way to check feasibility.

So how can we model the problem correctly?

The problem is similar to scheduling the required increases for each position using overlapping intervals of length w. Each interval (window) can contribute to w positions. The key is to find whether the required array can be covered with K intervals (K <= m) such that each position i is covered exactly required[i] times, and the sum of required is K * w.

But how?

This seems like a sliding window problem. Let's think of using a greedy approach. Perhaps we can model it using a sliding window and track the number of waterings needed as we proceed through the flowers.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the "minimum number of operations" type of problem. Let's model the required waterings as a difference array. We can use a prefix sum approach to track the number of times each position is covered.

But how?

Another approach is to model the watering operations as a difference array. For example, when we water a window [l, r], it's equivalent to adding 1 to all positions from l to r. But since the problem is to determine if it's possible to cover the required array with a certain number of such operations, this is similar to the problem of covering a certain array with a minimal number of intervals of fixed length, but in our case, the sum of required is fixed (m*w) and the question is whether it's possible to arrange the intervals such that each position i is covered exactly required[i] times, and the number of intervals is <= m.

But this seems tricky. Let's think of the problem as a sliding window where each time we apply a watering, it's a window of w flowers. The required array is the number of times each flower is watered.

The problem then reduces to whether the required array can be achieved by selecting K (<=m) windows of size w, such that each window contributes +1 to each position in the window.

But how to model this efficiently?

Another approach is to consider the problem as a greedy one. We can iterate through the flowers and apply the necessary waterings in a way that covers the required[i] as we go, using the earliest possible positions.

Here's an idea inspired by the "minimum number of taps to cover a garden" problem. We can use a sliding window approach and track the current number of waterings applied. Let's model the required array and see how many additional waterings we need to apply as we move through the array.

But the exact method is unclear. Let's think of how to model the required array and the effect of the watering windows.

Let me consider that for each position i, the number of times it's watered is the number of windows that include it. To model this, we can use a sliding window that applies a certain number of waterings in a way that affects the current and future positions.

Let's think about it as follows: when processing position i, the number of existing waterings that cover it is determined by the windows applied to the left of i. But since a window of size w starting at position j covers j to j + w -1. So any window starting at position j >= i - w +1 and <= i will cover position i.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the number of active windows that affect position i. Let's use a "difference array" approach. For example, when we apply a window starting at l, ending at l + w -1, it's equivalent to adding 1 to the difference array at l, and subtracting 1 at l + w. Then, the prefix sum of the difference array gives the number of times each position is covered.

But how do we model the required number of waterings for each position?

Alternatively, we can compute the number of additional windows that need to start at position i to cover the required[i] considering the existing coverage from previous windows.

Here's a possible approach:

We'll keep track of the current number of active waterings (i.e., how many times the current position is covered by previous windows). As we process each position i from left to right, the current coverage is the sum of all windows that were started in positions >= (i - w + 1) and <= i. Wait, no. The current coverage for position i is the number of windows that started in positions j where j <= i and j + w -1 >= i, i.e., j >= i - w +1.

But perhaps using a sliding window with a sliding window of size w can help here.

Alternatively, here's a method inspired by the "greedy" algorithm for similar problems:

We can model the problem using a sliding window of size w. For each position i, we need to determine how many new windows to start at position i, considering the coverage provided by previous windows.

Let's say we have an array current_water that tracks the number of times each position is covered by the windows applied so far. However, since applying a window at position i affects positions i to i + w -1, this is similar to a range update. To handle this efficiently, we can use a prefix sum array.

Let's think:

We can use a prefix sum array 'delta' where delta[i] represents the number of windows starting at position i. Then, the total coverage for position j is the sum of delta[i] for i from max(0, j - w + 1) to j. Wait, no. Because a window starting at i covers positions i to i + w - 1. So for position j, any window starting at i where i <= j and i + w -1 >= j (i <= j <= i +w -1) contributes 1. So i can be as low as j - w +1 (if that is >=0) up to j.

But summing delta[i] for i from (j -w +1) to j would give the number of windows that cover j.

But summing delta[i] for each j is O(nw), which is too slow for n=1e5. So we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.

Ah! Here's the key: the sum of delta[i] from (j -w +1) to j is equivalent to the prefix sum of delta up to j minus the prefix sum up to (j -w). So if we have a prefix sum array, we can compute this in O(1) per j.

Let's denote pre_sum[i] as the sum of delta[0] to delta[i-1]. So the sum from l to r (inclusive) is pre_sum[r+1] - pre_sum[l].

So for position j, the coverage is sum_{i= max(0, j -w +1)}^{j} delta[i} = pre_sum[j+1] - pre_sum[max(0, j -w +1)].

But pre_sum can be maintained as we process each j.

So here's the approach:

We can iterate through the flowers from left to right.

At each position j, we compute how much coverage we already have (from previous windows). Then, the required coverage for j is req = required[j]. The existing coverage is the sum of delta[i] from i = (j -w +1) to j. Let's call this current_coverage.

If current_coverage >= req, then we don't need to do anything here.

If current_coverage < req, then we need to add (req - current_coverage) windows starting at j. But wait, starting at j? Because a window starting at j will cover j to j +w -1. So adding a window at j will affect the next w positions. So to cover j, adding a window at j is the last possible position we can add it (since starting at j is the farthest left possible to cover j). Wait, no. Wait, if we add a window starting at j, then it covers j to j +w-1, so j is the first position in that window. If we add a window starting at j-1, it covers j-1 to j +w-2. So j can be covered by windows starting as far back as (j -w +1). But since we are processing from left to right, once we pass j, we can't add windows that start before j. Because we've already processed those positions.

So to cover j, the latest possible window we can add is starting at j (since starting after j would not cover j). Wait, no. If we start a window at j, j is covered. If we start a window at j+1, then j is not covered. So to cover j, the window must start at j -w +1 up to j.

But when processing j, we can only add windows that start at j or later. Because the algorithm is moving from left to right, and once we pass j, we can't go back and add windows to the left of j.

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let's see.

The algorithm's approach is to process each position j from left to right. At each step j, we calculate how much coverage is needed here, considering the windows added so far. If the current coverage is insufficient, we add as many windows as needed starting at position j -w +1. Wait, but j -w +1 may be a previous position. For example, j=5, w=3. Then j -w +1 =3. So adding a window at 3 would affect positions 3,4,5. But when processing j=5, we can't add a window starting at 3, because we already passed that position. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe we can only add windows starting at position j -w +1, but since we've passed that position, we can't add them. So this approach might not be feasible.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to add as many windows as possible at the earliest possible position that can affect j.

Wait, here's another idea: For position j, the latest possible window that can cover j is a window starting at j. Because starting at j, the window covers j to j +w-1, so j is covered. Starting at j+1 would not cover j.

So, when processing j, the current coverage is determined by all windows added up to now. If the required[j] is more than the current coverage, then we need to add (required[j] - current_coverage) windows starting at j -w +1. Wait, but j -w +1 could be less than 0. So perhaps the earliest possible window that can cover j is (j -w +1 +1) ? No, the earliest window that can cover j is one that starts at (j -w +1). For example, if w=3 and j=5, then a window starting at 3 covers 3,4,5. So j=5 is covered by a window starting at 3. But when processing j=5, adding a window at 3 is possible only if we are allowed to go back. But since we process from left to right, perhaps the algorithm is unable to do that. So this suggests that the greedy approach of adding windows as far to the right as possible (i.e., as late as possible) may not work.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to add windows as far to the right as possible. Because adding a window later in the array can cover more positions. For example, adding a window at j can cover j to j +w-1, which may help cover j+1, j+2, etc. So by adding windows as late as possible, we can maximize their coverage on the subsequent positions.

So here's the algorithm:

We keep track of the number of active windows that affect the current position. As we process each position i from left to right, we can calculate how much coverage we have from previous windows. If this coverage is less than required[i], then we need to add some number of new windows starting at position i. Because adding a window at i will cover up to i +w-1. However, since we can't go back, adding windows at i is the latest possible position to cover i. Thus, the number of new windows needed is (required[i] - current_coverage). Let's call this add. We add add windows starting at i. But since each window covers w positions, adding add windows at i will contribute to the coverage of positions i to i +w-1.

But how do we track the number of active windows and their coverage? Using a prefix sum array.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize a prefix sum array (delta) to track the number of windows added. Initially, all elements are 0.

2. Keep track of the current number of active windows (current_water) that affect the current position. This can be done by maintaining a sliding window sum of the delta array over the last w positions.

3. For each position i from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based indexing):

   a. current_water is the sum of delta[i - w +1 ... i]. But since we are processing i in order, we can use a sliding window approach with a queue or a variable to track the sum as we go.

   b. The required[i] = max(0, target - a[i]). If the required[i] < current_water, we can't remove any windows, so this is a problem. Wait, no. Because required[i] is the number of times i must be covered. So if current_water exceeds required[i], that's okay. Because the problem allows covering more than required, but sum is K *w. But no, the required array is the minimal needed. Wait, no. The required array is the exact number of times each position must be covered. But in the problem statement, each watering adds 1 to w flowers. So the sum of the required array must be exactly K *w, where K is the number of windows. But in our case, during the check for a certain target, the required array is the minimum required to reach the target. So any coverage beyond required[i] is allowed as long as the sum of required is <= m *w and K <=m.

Wait, no. For the check function, we need to determine if it's possible to have coverage >= required[i] for all i. Because adding more coverage is allowed. So the required[i] is the minimum coverage for each i. So, when processing i, the current_water is the number of times it's been covered. If current_water < required[i], then we need to add some more windows. If current_water >= required[i], then no action is needed.

But in the case where current_water exceeds required[i], that's okay. Because sum of required is <= sum of actual coverage, which equals K *w. So the sum of required must be <= K *w, which is <= m *w (since K <=m).

So the steps are:

For each i:

- Compute the required[i] = max(0, target - a[i]).

- Compute the current_water (sum of delta in the last w positions up to i).

- If current_water < required[i], compute the deficit (required[i] - current_water). We need to add deficit windows starting at i. But since each window starting at i covers i, i+1, ..., i +w-1. So these windows will affect positions up to i +w-1.

- However, since we can only add windows up to the end of the array (n-1), adding a window at i must have i +w-1 <n. Otherwise, the window is invalid.

Wait, in the problem statement, the window is exactly w contiguous flowers. So when adding a window at position i (assuming 0-based), the window is i to i +w-1. So i must be <= n -w. Because the window must fit within the array.

So for i in 0 to (n -w), we can add a window. If i is beyond (n -w), then the window would exceed the array.

Therefore, when processing position i, to add a window that covers i, the latest possible position to start the window is i. But if i is >= (n -w +1), then the window starts at i and covers up to i +w-1. But if i is beyond (n -w), then the window is invalid. Wait, no. For example, if n=5 and w=3, the last possible start position is 2 (0-based). Starting at 2, covers 2,3,4. Starting at 3 would cover 3,4,5 (but 5 is out of bounds for n=5). So the valid starting positions are 0 to 2 (n -w). So for any i where i +w -1 <n, it's a valid window.

So when processing position i, if we need to add deficit windows, we can only add them if the window starts at i, and i is <= (n -w). Otherwise, adding a window here is impossible.

Wait, but the problem allows watering any w contiguous flowers. So the window can start at any position as long as there are w flowers. So for example, in n=5 flowers (positions 0-4), w=3, the valid starting positions are 0,1,2 (since 0+3-1=2, 1+3-1=3, 2+3-1=4). So starting at 2 is allowed. Starting at 3 would require 3,4,5 (invalid). So the starting positions are 0 to (n -w).

Therefore, during the check for the required array, when processing position i, if we need to add deficit windows, and i is beyond (n -w), then it's impossible. Because any window starting at i would go beyond the array, which is invalid. So in that case, the check would fail.

So the algorithm steps are:

Initialize delta as an array of zeros (size n + 1).

current_water = 0

additions = 0

for i in 0..n-1:

    if i >= w:

        current_water -= delta[i - w]

    if current_water < required[i]:

        needed = required[i] - current_water

        start = i

        if start > (n -w):

            return False

        delta[start] += needed

        if start +w <n:

            delta[start +w] -= needed

        additions += needed

        current_water += needed

    if additions >m:

        return False

return additions <=m

Wait, this is a possible approach. Let's see:

We maintain a difference array delta, which allows us to track the number of windows added in a range. For each position i, we first subtract the delta[i -w] (if i >=w) to account for windows that have fallen out of the sliding window (since we are maintaining a sliding window of size w). Then, the current_water is the sum of delta in the current sliding window (i -w +1 to i).

If the current_water is less than required[i], we need to add some windows starting at i. But since each window starting at i affects positions i to i +w-1, we can add 'needed' windows here. However, the start position must be <= (n -w), because otherwise, the window would be invalid.

So, if i > (n -w), then adding a window here is invalid, so the check returns False.

Then, we update the delta array by adding 'needed' at start and subtracting at start +w. Then, current_water is increased by 'needed', and the total additions (number of windows) is incremented by 'needed'.

At each step, if additions exceed m, return False.

Finally, after processing all positions, check if additions <=m.

So this approach works as follows:

- It greedily adds the required windows at the latest possible position (i) to cover the current position's required coverage.

- The use of the difference array allows efficient tracking of the number of windows added and their coverage.

This approach is O(n), which is acceptable for n=1e5.

So the steps to implement the check function for a given target are:

1. Compute required array.

2. Check if any required[i] >m. If yes, return False.

3. Check if sum(required) > m*w. If yes, return False.

4. Apply the greedy algorithm with delta array to determine if it's possible to cover the required array with K <=m windows.

Wait, but steps 2 and 3 may be redundant because the algorithm would catch those cases. For example, sum(required) >m*w would be caught because each window contributes w to the sum. So additions (K) would be sum(required) /w, but if sum is more than m*w, then K would be sum(required)/w >m. But during the algorithm, each addition of 'needed' contributes K += needed. So sum(required) could be up to K *w, but K must be <=m.

Wait, no. For example, suppose sum(required) is 5, w=2, m=3. Then sum=5 <= 3*2=6. But K would be 5/2 (ceil) which is 3, which is <=m. So sum check would pass. But during the algorithm, K (additions) could be 3, which is <=m. So the sum check is necessary. Because if sum(required) >m *w, then K would be sum(required)/w (rounded up), which exceeds m. So the sum check is necessary to avoid such cases.

But the algorithm's 'additions' variable accumulates 'needed' (the deficit) for each position. So the sum of all 'needed' added is K. sum(required) could be <= K *w, but during the algorithm, the 'needed' is added in such a way that each 'needed' is added to a window of size w, thus contributing exactly needed *w to the sum. So sum(required) <= K *w is required.

But in the algorithm, the sum of required is not directly considered, but during the check, the sum is handled by the K *w >= sum(required).

Wait, no. For example, sum(required) could be 4, w=3, m=2. K=2. Then K *w=6 >=4. But sum(required) is 4, which is <=6. So the sum check (sum <=m*w) is 4 <=2*3=6 → True. But during the algorithm, perhaps sum(required) could be handled.

But in the algorithm, the required is the minimal needed, but the actual coverage could be more. For example, if during the algorithm, some positions are covered more than required. So the sum of actual coverage is K *w, which could be >= sum(required). But for the problem's check, the sum of required must be <= K *w. So the sum(required) <=m*w is a necessary condition.

Therefore, the sum check is required.

Similarly, the check for any required[i] >m is necessary because each required[i] can't exceed m (since you can't have more than m windows covering a single position).

So in the check function, we need to first check:

if sum(required) > m *w → invalid.

if any required[i] >m → invalid.

Only if both pass, proceed with the greedy algorithm.

Now, putting this together, the binary search steps are:

low = current_min

high = current_min +m

while low <=high:

   mid = (low +high) //2

   if check(mid) is possible:

      best = mid

      low = mid +1

   else:

      high = mid-1

Return best.

Now, the code:

First, read n, m, w.

Then read the a array.

Compute the initial minimum.

Then perform binary search between low and high.

For each mid, compute required array, check sum and max, then apply the greedy algorithm.

But for n=1e5, and binary search up to log2(1e5 +1e5) ≈20 steps. Each step O(n). So overall O(20n) = 2e6, acceptable.

Now, the code.

But let's think about possible optimizations.

In the check function, the required array can be computed on the fly, but for each mid, we can compute required[i] as max(0, mid -a[i]). But since mid can be up to 1e9 +1e5, but each a[i] is up to 1e9, required[i] can be up to 1e5.

But in the code, during the check function, we can compute the required array as we iterate through each i. But perhaps it's better to precompute it.

But in Python, for n=1e5, creating a new required array for each check is O(n) per check, which is manageable.

But for 1e5 *20 steps, that's 2e6 operations, which is okay.

But let's think: in the code, during the check function, for a given target, we can compute required[i] on the fly as we iterate through each position.

But perhaps it's better to precompute all required[i] and store them in a list.

But in Python, list comprehensions are efficient.

Now, the code.

Let's outline the code.

Read n, m, w.

a = list of integers.

current_min = min(a)

low = current_min

high = current_min +m

best = current_min

while low <= high:

   mid = (low + high) //2

   # Check if mid is possible.

   required = [max(0, mid - x) for x in a]

   sum_req = sum(required)

   if sum_req ==0:

       # All required are zero, so possible.

       best = mid

       low = mid +1

       continue

   max_req = max(required)

   if max_req >m or sum_req > m*w:

       high = mid -1

       continue

   # Now apply the greedy algorithm.

   # Implement the delta array approach.

   delta = [0]*(n+1)

   current_water =0

   additions =0

   for i in range(n):

       # Subtract the delta that is out of the window.

       if i >=w:

           current_water -= delta[i -w]

       # Check if current_water is less than required[i]

       if current_water < required[i]:

           needed = required[i] - current_water

           start = i

           # Check if start is within the possible positions.

           if start > n -w:

               # Cannot add a window here, since it would go beyond the array.

               additions = m+1

               break

           delta[start] += needed

           end = start +w

           if end <n:

               delta[end] -= needed

           additions += needed

           current_water += needed

           if additions >m:

               break

   if additions <=m:

       best = mid

       low = mid +1

   else:

       high = mid -1

print(best)

But wait, the code above has a potential issue. The 'start' variable is set to i. But when i is the current position, adding a window starting at i may not cover i. For example, if w=3 and i=0, the window starts at 0 and covers 0,1,2. So i=0 is covered.

Yes. So in this case, adding the window at i (current position) is the earliest possible (since we are processing left to right) to cover the current position's deficit.

But during the iteration, when processing i, adding a window at i (start =i) is allowed as long as start +w-1 <n. Because start must be <= n -w.

Thus, in the code, the check is:

if start >n -w → invalid.

But n -w is the maximum allowed start index (since start +w-1 =n-1).

So, for example, when n=5 and w=3, the maximum start is 5-3=2. So for i=3, which is start=3, 3>2 → invalid.

Thus, the code correctly checks for start >n -w and breaks, setting additions to m+1 to fail the check.

Another example: in the first sample input:

6 2 3

2 2 2 2 1 1

The initial a is [2,2,2,2,1,1]. The current_min is 1.

Binary search would check mid =1, 2, 3, etc.

For mid=2:

required = [0,0,0,0,1,1]. sum_req=2.

sum_req=2 <= m*w=2*3=6. max_req=1 <=2.

Then, applying the algorithm:

delta array is initialized to [0]*7.

current_water =0.

additions=0.

i=0:

current_water is 0. required[0] is 0. So no action.

i=1:

current_water is 0. required[1] is 0. No action.

i=2:

current_water is 0. required[2] is 0. No action.

i=3:

current_water is 0. required[3] is 0. No action.

i=4:

current_water is 0. required[4] is 1.

So needed is 1. start=4. n=6, n-w=3. So 4>3 → invalid. So additions becomes 3 (m=2 →3>2). So check returns False. Thus, for mid=2, the code would return False. But according to the sample input, the answer is 2. Wait, this suggests a problem.

Wait, no. Wait, in the first sample input, the answer is 2. But according to the required array for mid=2, the required is [0,0,0,0,1,1]. But how can that be possible? Because the beaver can't water enough to get those two flowers to 2.

Wait, the initial flowers are [2,2,2,2,1,1]. After m=2 days, the maximum possible minimum is 2. Because the two flowers are 1. To reach 2, each needs 1 watering. But with two days and window size 3.

The sample explanation says that he waters the last 3 flowers on day 1. So the last three become 2, 2, 2. Then on day 2, he does nothing.

So the final array is [2,2,2,3,2,2]. The minimum is 2.

So for mid=2, the required array is [0,0,0,0,1,1]. sum_req=2. sum_req=2 <= 2*3=6. max_req=1 <=2.

So the code's check for mid=2 should return True. But according to the code's algorithm, when processing i=4 (0-based index, which is the fifth flower in the input), the code checks if start=4>6-3=3. 4>3 → yes. So additions becomes m+1 (2+1=3), leading to check failure.

This suggests a bug in the algorithm.

Wait, why? Because in the first sample, the required is for positions 4 and5 (0-based 4 and5) to each have 1 added. How can the code handle this?

The code's algorithm processes each position from left to right. For position 4 (0-based), required is 1. But the code tries to add a window starting at i=4, but 4>3 (n-w=6-3=3). So it's invalid. Thus, the code returns that it's not possible. But in reality, it is possible by adding a window at position 3 (which covers 3,4,5) once. So in the code's algorithm, how is this handled?

Ah, the problem is that the code's algorithm is adding windows starting at position i (the current position). But in this case, the required at position 4 can be covered by a window that starts at position 3. However, since the algorithm is processing position 4, it's too late to add a window at position 3. Because the algorithm has already processed positions 0-3.

So the code's algorithm is not able to consider adding windows at earlier positions when processing later positions. Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

This indicates that the greedy approach of adding windows at the current position is flawed.

Thus, the algorithm needs to be adjusted. The correct approach should allow adding windows at positions that are earlier than i, but this seems difficult as the algorithm processes left to right.

Alternative approach: the windows can be added at any position, but the algorithm must track the coverage. So perhaps the correct approach is to add the required windows as far to the right as possible, but within the window that can affect the current position.

Wait, here's another idea: the required coverage for position i is the sum of the windows that start in [i -w +1, i]. So when processing i, the required coverage is required[i], and the current coverage is current_water. If there is a deficit, we need to add 'needed' windows that start in [i -w +1, i], but the latest possible position to add them is i. Because adding a window at i is the latest possible start that can affect i.

But when processing i, the algorithm can only add windows starting at positions >= (i -w +1) and <=i. But since the algorithm is processing left to right, when at i, the earliest possible start is (i -w +1), which may have already been processed.

Thus, the algorithm can't add windows at positions before i, because those positions have already been processed and the required coverage for earlier positions has already been handled.

So this suggests that the algorithm's approach is incorrect and that a different method is needed.

Alternative approach inspired by the solution to the 'minimum number of taps to cover a garden' problem.

We can model the required coverage as a range, and for each position i, track the maximum number of windows that can affect it.

But this is unclear.

Another idea is to use a sliding window and track the number of windows that need to be added in each possible window.

But this seems similar to the previous approach.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a range updates problem. We need to apply a number of range updates (each covering w positions) to meet or exceed the required array, and the total number of such updates should be <=m.

This is similar to the problem of covering an array with the minimum number of ranges. However, here we have a fixed range length and need to determine if it's possible to cover the required array with at most m ranges.

An alternative approach is to model the problem using a sliding window and track the number of additional windows needed as we move through the array.

The following approach is inspired by the solution to the problem presented here:

https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/49602

The problem seems similar to the 'Fertilizer' problem. Let me check that.

In the solution discussed there, a sliding window approach is used, similar to what we tried earlier, but with a correction.

In that approach, the algorithm uses a prefix sum array to track the number of windows added, and for each position i, calculates the number of windows that must start in the range [i, i +w -1].

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's a corrected version of the algorithm:

When processing position i, the number of windows that must cover i is (required[i] - current_water). But since each window that covers i can start at any position from [i -w +1, i], the latest possible position to add a window that covers i is i. So we need to add these needed windows starting at i -w +1, but this may not be possible if i -w +1 is <0. So the algorithm must handle this.

Wait, but this seems to require adding windows at i -w +1, but when processing i, it's possible that i -w +1 is already in the past. So adding windows there is no longer possible.

Thus, the algorithm must add the needed windows as far to the right as possible, but within the range that can still affect i.

For example, when processing i, the latest possible position to add a window that covers i is i. So the needed windows must be added at positions max(0, i -w +1) to i. But since the algorithm is processing left to right, the earliest possible position to add the needed windows is i -w +1, but this may have already been processed.

Thus, the algorithm must add the needed windows at the earliest possible position that is still available (i.e., not yet processed) when processing i.

But this is not feasible once i has been processed.

Thus, the algorithm's previous approach is incorrect.

The correct approach must add the needed windows in a way that they are added in the earliest possible position that can still affect i and future positions.

But how?

Perhaps the correct approach is to add the needed windows at position i -w +1, but if that position is not available, then it's impossible.

But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to add the needed windows as far to the right as possible, which is position (i -w +1), but in a way that this position is not beyond the current processing position.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm should add the needed windows at position (i -w +1 +1) ? Not sure.

This suggests that the previous algorithm is incorrect and that a different approach is needed.

An alternative way to model this problem is to use a difference array and track the number of windows added, but then compute the coverage as the prefix sum. However, this would be O(n) but may not account for the window's position correctly.

Another idea is to use a sliding window sum of the required array. For example, each window of size w can contribute at most m waterings. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a cumulative sum problem. For each position i, the number of windows that include i is the number of windows added in positions [i -w +1, i].

So the coverage for position i is the sum of the windows added in that range.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach:

We can model the required array as the sum of overlapping windows of size w. Let's think of the required array as the sum of several windows, each contributing 1 to w consecutive positions.

The problem is to determine if there exists a sequence of K windows (K <=m) such that the sum of their contributions is >= the required array.

But how to model this.

This is similar to finding a vector x (where x[i] is the number of times a window starting at i is used) such that:

sum_{j=max(0, i -w +1)}^{i} x[j] >= required[i] for all i.

sum x[i] <=m.

x[i] >=0 for all i.

But solving this system is not straightforward.

But we can use the greedy approach, adding as few windows as possible.

So here's a different algorithm:

We need to process the required array and determine the minimal number of windows needed.

We can use a sliding window to track the required coverage and determine how many windows must be added.

Let's use a sliding window of size w. For each position i, the coverage is the sum of windows in the last w positions.

We can track the current coverage and the number of windows added.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach inspired by the "minimum number of operations to turn a binary array into all zeros" problem.

We can use a difference array to track the number of windows added, and compute the current coverage as we move through the array.

Here's how:

Initialize a difference array delta of size n+1, initialized to 0.

current_water =0

additions =0

for i in 0..n-1:

    current_water += delta[i]

    if current_water < required[i]:

        needed = required[i] - current_water

        # Add 'needed' windows starting at i.

        # These windows will cover positions i to i +w-1.

        # But i +w-1 must be <n.

        if i +w >n:

            return False

        additions += needed

        delta[i] += needed

        delta[i +w] -= needed

        current_water += needed

    # Subtract the delta[i] after processing.

    # Wait, no. Because current_water is the sum of delta[0..i], but we need to track the sum for the current position.

    # No, current_water is the sum of delta[0..i-1]?

    # Not sure.

Wait, this approach may not work. Let me think again.

The delta array is used to track the effect of windows added. When a window is added at position i, it contributes 1 to positions i, i+1, ..., i +w-1. So the difference array delta can be updated by +1 at i and -1 at i +w.

The current_water for position j is the sum of delta[0..j], which gives the total number of windows that include j.

But in this model, the current_water is computed as the sum of delta[0..j], but this would require O(1) time per j if we precompute the prefix sums.

But this approach would require O(n) time to compute the prefix sum.

But we need to process the array in a way that allows us to determine the number of windows needed as we go.

So, the correct approach may be to use a sliding window sum, but the previous algorithm had a mistake in the way it handled the delta array.

Let's re-examine the previous code.

The code initializes a delta array of size n+1.

current_water is initialized to 0.

additions is initialized to 0.

For each i in 0..n-1:

    if i >=w:

        current_water -= delta[i -w]

    if current_water < required[i]:

        needed = required[i] - current_water

        start =i

        if start >n -w:

            return False

        delta[start] += needed

        end = start +w

        if end <=n:

            delta[end] -= needed

        additions += needed

        current_water += needed

    if additions >m:

        return False

The problem in the first sample is that when i=3 (0-based), required[i] is 0. But when i=4, the required is 1. The code attempts to add a window at i=4, which is start=4. But n=6, w=3. n -w =3. So 4>3 → invalid. So the code returns False, but the correct solution is possible.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The correct approach would require adding a window at position 3 (i=3) to cover positions 3,4,5 (0-based). But how does the algorithm know to add this window when processing i=3?

Let's see:

Processing i=0:

current_water is 0. required[0] is 0. No action.

i=1:

current_water is 0. required[1] is 0. No action.

i=2:

current_water is 0. required[2] is 0. No action.

i=3:

current_water is 0. required[3] is 0. No action.

i=4:

current_water is 0. required[4] is 1.

needed =1.

start =4. n-w=3. 4>3 → invalid. Thus, additions is set to m+1, and the check returns False.

But the correct solution requires adding a window at position 3. So the algorithm should have added the window at position 3 when processing i=3.

But why didn't it?

Because when processing i=3, required[i] is 0. So no action is taken. But the window at position 3 would help cover positions 4 and 5. So the algorithm's approach of only adding windows when processing i and required[i] is not sufficient.

Thus, the algorithm's approach is flawed. It does not account for future positions' required coverage. It only tries to meet the current position's required coverage, without considering that adding windows now could help future positions.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative solution:

The correct approach should consider the required coverage for each position and apply the necessary windows as early as possible to cover current and future positions.

Here's an idea inspired by this realization:

When processing position i, we need to determine how many windows must be added starting at position i to cover the required[i] based on the current coverage and the coverage from future windows.

But how?

Another approach is to use a sliding window sum and track the number of windows added in the current window of size w.

Here's how:

- We use a sliding window of size w to track the number of windows added in the last w positions.

- For each position i, the coverage from previous windows in the current window is current_water.

- If current_water < required[i], then we need to add (required[i] - current_water) windows starting at position (i). But since these windows will cover up to i +w-1, we need to ensure that i +w-1 <= n-1.

- So, we add (required[i] - current_water) windows at position i, and update the current_water and the sliding window sum.

This approach is similar to the previous algorithm but with the correct handling of window positions.

Let's walk through the first sample:

n=6, m=2, w=3.

required array for mid=2 is [0,0,0,0,1,1].

Processing i=0:

current_water=0. required[0] is 0. No action.

i=1:

current_water=0. required[1]=0. No action.

i=2:

current_water=0. required[2]=0. No action.

i=3:

current_water=0. required[3]=0. No action.

i=4:

current_water=0. required[4]=1. needed=1.

start=4. Check if start <=n-w →4 <=3 →False. So impossible. So code returns False.

But the correct solution adds a window at position 3. So the algorithm is not able to see this.

Thus, the algorithm's approach is incorrect.

The correct algorithm must allow adding windows at position i -w +1 when processing i.

But how to do that.

Ah, here's the mistake in the algorithm: the current_water is computed based on the delta array, which only includes windows added up to i. But when processing i, the current_water is the sum of the delta[i-w+1 ... i], which is the number of windows that affect i. But if the required[i] is higher than current_water, we need to add windows at i -w +1, but this position may have already been processed.

Thus, the algorithm's current approach is unable to add windows at earlier positions, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the correct approach is to add windows as far to the left as possible, but this requires processing in reverse.

But that's not feasible.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to precompute the required number of windows at each position, and use a sliding window to track the number of windows that can affect future positions.

But I'm not sure.

An alternative solution is to model the required array and compute the number of windows needed using a sliding window approach. Here's the correct algorithm:

Initialize an array of the number of windows added at each position, initially zero.

We'll keep track of the current number of windows that affect the current position.

We'll also use a sliding window to track the number of windows added in the current window.

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

    current_water += window_add[i -w] if i >=w (i.e., subtract windows that are out of the window)

    if current_water < required[i]:

        needed = required[i] - current_water

        if i +w >n:

            return False

        window_add[i] = needed

        current_water += needed

        total_add += needed

        if total_add >m:

            return False

return total_add <=m

But this is not correct. Let's think again.

The idea is to track how many windows are added in the current window of size w. The current_water is the sum of the window_add in the current window (i -w +1 to i). For each i, if current_water is less than required[i], then add needed windows at position i. These windows will affect positions i to i +w-1.

But in the first sample, when processing i=4:

current_water is 0 (no windows added in positions 1 to 4). required[4] is 1. So needed=1. Add 1 window at position 4. But position 4+3=7 is beyond n=6, so this is invalid. But the correct solution is to add a window at position 3.

Thus, this approach would also fail.

Thus, the correct algorithm must add windows at position i -w +1 when processing i.

But how to do that.

The correct approach seems to be:

For each i, the required[i] is the sum of the windows added in positions (i -w +1) to i.

When processing i from left to right:

- current_water is the sum of windows added in positions (i -w +1) to i-1.

- So, the remaining coverage for i is current_water.

- If current_water < required[i], then we need to add (required[i] - current_water) windows in positions (i -w +1) to i. But the earliest position in this range is (i -w +1). But since we are processing left to right, we can't add windows at positions before i.

Thus, the only possible position to add the needed windows is at (i -w +1). But this position may have already been processed, and we can't go back.

Thus, the algorithm can't add windows at (i -w +1) when processing i, leading to the problem.

Thus, the correct approach must add windows as early as possible.

But how?

Here's a different approach inspired by the correct solution:

We need to track the number of windows added in each position. The coverage for position i is the sum of windows added in positions (i -w +1) to i.

We can model this with a sliding window sum.

When processing i, if the current_water (sum of windows in (i -w +1) to i) is less than required[i], then we need to add (needed) windows at position (i). However, this can't be done if (i) is beyond (n -w), as the window would extend beyond the array.

But this is the same as the previous algorithm, which fails the first sample.

Thus, the problem must be that the initial approach is incorrect.

But the first sample requires adding a window at position 3 (0-based) to cover positions 3,4,5. How can the algorithm be modified to add this window when processing i=3?

Ah! Because when processing i=3, the required[i] is 0. So no windows are added. But the required for i=4 and i=5 are 1 each. But how can the algorithm account for that.

The algorithm processes i=4, and finds that current_water is 0. But adding a window at i=4 is not possible (since 4+3=7>6). So the algorithm returns False, but the correct solution is to add a window at i=3.

Thus, the algorithm's approach is incorrect because it does not consider adding windows that would help future positions, even if the current position's required is already met.

Thus, the correct algorithm must look ahead to future positions and add windows even when the current position's required is met.

But how to model that.

This seems like a difficult problem. I'm not sure how to proceed further.

Perhaps the correct approach is to use the initial algorithm but modify the condition for adding windows. For example, when processing i, we need to consider the required for the next w positions and add windows at i to cover them.

But this seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct algorithm is to use the initial approach but allow adding windows at position (i -w +1) when possible.

But how to track this.

Another idea: the required[i] must be covered by windows added in positions (i -w +1) to i. To ensure that all required[i] are met, we need to add enough windows in those positions. So when processing i, we can add the needed windows at the earliest possible position in (i -w +1) to i that is still available (i.e., not processed yet). But since the algorithm processes left to right, the earliest possible position is i -w +1, which may be less than 0 or already processed.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Another possible solution:

The correct algorithm must add windows at position (i -w +1) when processing i. However, this position may be in the past. So, this is impossible.

Thus, the correct algorithm must process the array in a way that allows adding windows at position (i -w +1) when needed.

But how.

The correct algorithm is to use a sliding window of size w and track the number of windows added in the current window. When processing i, the number of windows added in positions (i -w +1) to i must be >= required[i]. If not, add the needed windows at position (i -w +1 +1) ? Not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for hints or solutions.

Upon searching for similar problems, I find that this problem can be solved using a binary search approach combined with a sliding window technique to check feasibility, as described in the initial approach. However, the initial approach must have a mistake in the way it handles the window additions.

In particular, the correct way to model the algorithm is to add the needed windows at the current position i, but when i exceeds n -w, the code must return False. However, this is not the case in the first sample. So what is the correct way?

Wait, in the first sample:

n=6, m=2, w=3.

required array for mid=2 is [0,0,0,0,1,1].

The algorithm must add 1 window at position 3 (0-based), which covers positions 3,4,5. This would contribute 1 to positions 4 and5.

So when processing i=3:

current_water is 0 (since no windows added before). required[3] is 0. So no action.

But when processing i=4:

current_water is 0. required[4] is 1. So needed=1. start=4. 4>6-3=3. So additions=3>m=2. So check returns False.

But the correct window is added at position 3. So the algorithm's code is not adding it.

Thus, the code's algorithm is incorrect.

The mistake is that the code is adding windows at i, but the required window for positions 4 and5 must be added at position 3, which is processed before i=4.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The correct approach must allow adding windows at position 3 when processing i=3, even though required[3] is 0.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect, and the correct approach must add windows based on future requirements.

But how.

This suggests that the problem cannot be solved with the initial approach and requires a different algorithm.

An alternative approach is to compute the required number of windows for each position and then use a sliding window to track the sum of windows added. However, this requires precomputing the required windows for each position.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea is to use a sliding window of size w and compute the required number of windows in each window. The required number of windows in window i to i +w-1 is the maximum required in that window. But this also seems incorrect.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows:

Each window of size w can contribute to exactly w consecutive flowers. The total number of windows is K <=m. The sum of all required[i] must be <=K *w.

Additionally, the required array must be achievable by some sequence of K windows.

The correct way to check feasibility is to use a greedy algorithm that adds windows as far to the right as possible. This is the approach used in the initial algorithm, but with a correction to the starting position.

The correct starting position when processing i is max(0, i -w +1). But this requires adding windows at positions that may have already been processed.

But this is impossible, so the algorithm must add windows at the earliest possible position that can still cover i.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to add windows at position (i -w +1) when processing i. But if this position is <0, then it's impossible.

But how to manage this when the algorithm is processing left to right.

Here's the corrected algorithm:

Initialize delta array as before.

current_water =0

additions=0

for i in 0 to n-1:

    # Subtract the delta that is out of the window of size w.

    if i >=w:

        current_water -= delta[i -w]

    if current_water < required[i]:

        needed = required[i] - current_water

        # The earliest position to add windows is i -w +1, but that may have been processed.

        # The latest position to add windows to cover i is i.

        # So add needed windows at position (i -w +1), but ensure it is >=0 and <=n -w.

        start = i -w +1

        if start <0:

            start =0

        if start >n -w:

            # Cannot add windows to cover i.

            return False

        # Add needed windows at position start.

        # These windows will cover positions start to start +w-1.

        delta[start] += needed

        if start +w <n:

            delta[start +w] -= needed

        additions += needed

        current_water += needed

        if additions >m:

            return False

This way, when processing i, we add windows at the earliest possible position (start) that can cover i and future positions.

But this requires adding windows at earlier positions, which may have already been processed. But since the delta array tracks the cumulative sum, this should be possible.

Let's test this corrected algorithm on the first sample.

Sample 1:

n=6, m=2, w=3.

required = [0,0,0,0,1,1]

Processing i=0:

current_water is 0. required[0] is 0. No action.

i=1:

current_water is 0. required[1] is 0. No action.

i=2:

current_water is 0. required[2] is 0. No action.

i=3:

current_water is 0. required[3] is 0. No action.

i=4:

current_water is 0. required[4] is 1.

needed=1.

start =4 -3 +1=2.

Check if start <=n -w=3. 2 <=3 → yes.

Add needed=1 at start=2.

delta[2] +=1. delta[5] -=1.

additions=1.

current_water =0+1=1.

i=4 is processed.

i=5:

current_water =1 (delta[2] is 1. i=5 >=3: current_water -= delta[5-3=2] →1-1=0).

required[5] is 1.

needed=1.

start=5-3+1=3.

start=3 <=3 → yes.

Add needed=1 at start=3.

delta[3] +=1. delta[6] -=1.

additions=2.

current_water=0+1=1.

Processing continues.

All i processed.

additions=2 <=m=2.

Thus, returns True.

Thus, the algorithm would return True for mid=2 in the first sample.

Thus, the code's algorithm needed to be modified to calculate the start position as i -w +1.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to add the needed windows at position (i -w +1) when processing i.

Thus, the previous code's mistake was in using start=i instead of start=i-w+1.

Thus, the corrected code is:

In the check function:

needed = required[i] - current_water

start = i -w +1

if start <0:

    start =0

if start > n -w:

    # Cannot add windows here.

    return False

delta[start] += needed

if start +w <n:

    delta[start +w] -= needed

additions += needed

current_water += needed

Thus, the code's start is computed as i -w +1, not i.

This is the key correction.

Thus, the code should be updated accordingly.

Let's re-examine the first sample with this correction.

In the first sample, when processing i=4, the start is 4-3+1=2.

Adding a window at start=2 (0-based) covers positions 2,3,4.

This increases the coverage for i=4 and 5.

Thus, the code now correctly adds the window at position 2 and 3, leading to the correct solution.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to add windows at position (i -w +1) when processing i.

Thus, the code must be modified accordingly.

This is the correct approach.

Now, updating the code:

The code should have:

start = i -w +1

if start <0:

    start =0

if start >n -w:

    # Cannot add.

    return False

Thus, the code is corrected.

Let's implement this in the code.

The final code will be as follows:

Read n, m, w.

a = list of integers.

current_min = min(a)

low = current_min

high = current_min +m

best = current_min

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    required = [max(0, mid - x) for x in a]

    sum_req = sum(required)

    if sum_req ==0:

        best = mid

        low = mid +1

        continue

    max_req = max(required)

    if max_req >m or sum_req >m*w:

        high = mid-1

        continue

    delta = [0]*(n+1)

    current_water =0

    additions =0

    for i in range(n):

        if i >=w:

            current_water -= delta[i -w]

        if current_water < required[i]:

            needed = required[i] - current_water

            start = i -w +1

            if start <0:

                start =0

            if start > n -w:

                # Cannot add windows to cover i.

                additions = m+1

                break

            delta[start] += needed

            if start +w <n:

                delta[start +w] -= needed

            additions += needed

            current_water += needed

            if additions >m:

                break

    if additions <=m:

        best = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid-1

print(best)

The second sample:

Input:

2 5 1

5 8

The initial a is [5,8]. current_min=5.

low=5, high=5+5=10.

For mid=9:

required = [4,1].

sum_req=5.

m*w=5*1=5. sum_req=5=5*1.

max_req=4 <=5.

Check:

delta array.

current_water=0.

i=0:

current_water <4. needed=4.

start=0-1+1=0.

start=0 <=2-1=1.

delta[0] +=4.

delta[1] -=4.

additions=4.

current_water=4.

i=1:

current_water -= delta[0] (0-1+1=0 →i=1 >=1, subtract delta[0].

delta[0]=4.

current_water=4-4=0.

required[1]=1.

needed=1.

start=1-1+1=1 <=1.

delta[1] +=1.

delta[2] -=1.

additions=5.

current_water=1.

additions=5 <=5.

Thus, mid=9 is possible. The code would set best=9 and search higher.

For mid=10:

required = [5,2]. sum_req=7>5*1=5. So sum check fails.

Thus, the answer is 9.

Thus, the code works for both samples.

Thus, the correct code is as above.
