Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the goal is to find the longest prefix of days where after removing exactly one day, all remaining colors have the same count. Hmm.

First, let's understand the conditions under which a valid x exists. For each x, we need to check if after considering the first x days, there's a way to remove one day such that all colors in the remaining x-1 days have the same frequency.

So, for each position x, we have to track the frequencies of the colors up to that point. Then, check the possible valid conditions.

What are the possible valid scenarios?

Case 1: All colors except one have the same frequency, and one color has frequency 1. For example, like [1,1,2,2,3]. If we remove the 3, all are 2. So here, the max frequency is 2, and there's one element with 1. So, when you remove that one, the total becomes (x-1) days, and all counts are equal.

Case 2: There's one color that has a frequency one higher than all others, and all others are the same. For example, [3,3,3,2,2]. Here, removing one 3 (frequency 3 becomes 2) which matches the others. So, one color's count is max_freq, and others are max_freq -1, and there's only one such color.

Or maybe another case: when all colors have a count of 1. Then, if x-1 is 1 (since after removing one, x-1 =1-1=0?), but wait, if x is 1, then removing that one day leaves zero days. But according to the problem statement, when x is 1, removing that day leaves zero days. But in that case, all colors (none) have the same count. So x=1 is a valid solution. Like the third example, where x=1.

So for each x, we need to track the frequencies and check if the current frequencies meet one of these two cases, or maybe some other edge cases.

Now, the challenge is to track the frequencies efficiently for each x, and check the conditions.

Constraints are up to 1e5, which is manageable. So for each x, we need O(1) or O(k) where k is the number of unique elements. But if k can be up to x (worst case all elements unique), then O(k) per x would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5.

So we need a way to track the conditions in O(1) per step.

Hmm. Let's think about how to track the current frequencies and their counts.

For example, we can track:

- A frequency dictionary: count[u] = number of occurrences of color u up to x.

Then, we can also track the frequencies of frequencies. So, freq_count[f] is the number of colors that have frequency f.

So for each x, after updating count and freq_count, we can check the current state of freq_count to see if the conditions are met.

For example, in the first case where one color has frequency 1 and all others have the same frequency:

The freq_count should have:

- freq_count[1] = 1 (one color with frequency 1)

And all other frequencies (if any) must be same. But in this case, since all other colors have frequency f, and the sum of their counts would be x-1 (since the total after removing the 1 is x-1). Wait, the sum of (f * (number of colors with f)) plus 1 (the color with 1) would be x. Because x is the sum of all frequencies. Then, after removing the 1, sum becomes x-1. So in this case, the sum of (f * (c)) where c is the number of colors with frequency f (excluding the 1) plus 1 (the 1's frequency) must equal x.

Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let's think about possible scenarios where the frequencies can be adjusted by removing one occurrence.

Possible scenarios that are valid:

1. All elements have the same frequency. Then, removing any element (so the x is x+1?), wait, no. Wait, if all elements have frequency m, then after removing one, one element will have frequency m-1. So unless m-1 is 0 (like when m=1 and all elements are unique), then the rest would have m. So this is only possible if either:

a) All elements except one are frequency 1. Like x is 5, all elements are 1, except one which is 2. Then after removing that element, all are 1. But that's covered in case 1.

Wait, perhaps the valid cases are:

- All colors have frequency 1. So any x where x-1 is 0 (x=1), or if x is any number but the sum would be x-1. Wait, no. If all colors in x days have frequency 1, then x is the number of colors. So if we remove one day (any day), the remaining x-1 days would have x-1 colors, each with frequency 1. Wait, no. Because x is the count of days. So if all are distinct, then x is the number of colors. So when you remove one day, you have x-1 days and x-1 colors (each with frequency 1). So this is valid. So in this case, the x can be any x where all colors in x days are unique, and x-1 is the count. So the condition is that x-1 = number of colors (since each is unique, then x-1 must be the number of colors in x days minus 1. Wait, no. If in x days all are unique, then the number of colors is x. So after removing one day, the number of colors is x-1, each with frequency 1. So the sum of frequencies is x-1, and each frequency is 1. So this is valid. So for example, the input where n=5 and all elements are distinct. Then, x=5 would be valid. Because after removing one day (any), you have four days, all distinct. So all have frequency 1. So this is valid. So in that case, the answer for that input would be 5.

But how to check this scenario using the freq_count?

In this scenario, after considering x days:

- The freq_count for 1 is x (each color has frequency 1). Then, when you remove one day, you have x-1 days. So freq_count would be x-1, but that's not directly tracked. Hmm.

Alternatively, for the current x, the frequencies are all 1, so freq_count[1] = x. So when x is 5, freq_count[1] is 5. Then, the sum is 5 (1*5). Then, after removing one, sum is 4 (1*4). So all frequencies are 1. So this is valid.

So in this case, the condition is that freq_count[1] = x. Because each color is unique. So when you remove one, you have x-1 colors, each with frequency 1. So that's valid. So this is another possible case.

So possible valid conditions are:

1. There is exactly one color with frequency 1, and all others have the same frequency f. Then, removing that color will leave all with frequency f. For example, frequencies are {1:1, f: k}, and 1 + f*k = x. Then, after removing, sum is (x-1) = f*k. So the sum must be x = 1 + f*k. Then, the valid condition is:

- freq_count[1] == 1 and (freq_count.get(f, 0) * f + 1) == x.

But how to track this.

Alternatively, the conditions can be:

Either:

a) There's exactly one color with frequency 1, and all other colors have the same frequency. So freq_count[1] == 1, and the rest of the frequencies (summing to x-1) must all be the same. For example, the other frequencies are f, and (freq_count[f] * f) == x - 1.

OR

b) There's exactly one color with frequency m, and all others have frequency m-1. So, the maximum frequency is m, and there's exactly one color with m, and the rest have m-1. So when we remove one occurrence of that color, all colors have m-1. For example, frequencies are m for one color and m-1 for others. So sum is 1*m + (others) * (m-1) = x. After removing one occurrence of m, sum becomes x-1, and all frequencies are m-1.

So the conditions here would be: the maximum frequency is m, and freq_count[m] == 1, and freq_count[m-1] == (total number of colors - 1). Also, the sum (m + (m-1)*(k-1)) ) = x, where k is the total number of colors.

Alternatively, we can check if:

- The max frequency is m.

- There's exactly one color with m.

- All other colors have m-1.

So in terms of freq_count, this would be:

- freq_count[m] == 1.

- freq_count[m-1] == (number of colors) - 1.

Also, the sum m + (m-1)*(k-1) = x. But how to compute this sum. Wait, k is the total number of colors, which is (freq_count[m] + freq_count[m-1]).

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let's see.

Another possible case is when all colors have frequency 1 except one which has frequency 2. Then, removing that color once would make all have frequency 1. Wait, no. For example, [1,1,2,3]. After removing one 1, the counts are 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (1). So that's valid. So in this case, the condition is that one color has frequency 2, others have 1. So for x=4, sum is 4. After removing, sum is 3, and all counts are 1.

So this would fall under case a) where one color has frequency 2 (m=2), and others have 1 (m-1=1). So the conditions for case b are satisfied.

So how to model these cases.

Now, for each x, after updating the frequency counts, we need to check if any of these cases hold.

So, the steps are:

For each x from 1 to n:

- Update the count for u_i (the current color). For example, previous count was c, then we increment it to c+1.

- Then, update the freq_count: decrement freq_count[c], increment freq_count[c+1]. If freq_count[c] becomes zero, remove it from the dict.

- Then, check if the current state of freq_count meets one of the valid conditions.

So, after processing each x, check the possible conditions.

Now, what are the possible valid freq_count structures?

Case 1: All elements have frequency 1. So freq_count[1] is the number of elements. But in this case, if x is the sum of 1*count, which is x. So when you remove one, the sum is x-1, and all elements have frequency 1. So this is valid only if after removal, sum is (x-1) = (count -1) * 1. But count here is x (since each element is unique). So x-1 = (x-1) * 1 â†’ which is always true. So whenever all elements have frequency 1, any x is valid. But wait, if x is 5, all elements unique. Then after removing one, the sum is 4, which is the count of elements (4 elements, each with frequency 1). So valid. So for this case, the condition is that all elements have frequency 1, which implies that freq_count has {1: x} (since sum of 1*x is x). So when x is any number, but after checking that all elements are unique.

So when the freq_count has only 1 entry, which is key 1 and value x. Then x is valid.

But wait, x can be 1. For example, the third input. Then, the sum is 1 (frequency 1), and after removing, sum is 0. Which is allowed.

So this is a valid condition.

So, this is a possible case. So when checking, if freq_count has only 1 key (1), and its value is x, then it's valid.

Case 2: There's exactly one element with frequency 1, and all others have the same frequency. So freq_count[1] is 1, and there's another frequency f such that freq_count[f] is (k-1), where k is the total number of colors (k = 1 + (k-1)).

So, for example, if there are 3 colors, one with 1 and two with f. Then the sum is 1 + 2f = x. But after removing the 1, the sum is 2f, which equals x-1. All elements now have frequency f, so valid.

So to check this condition:

- The freq_count must have two keys: 1 and f.

- freq_count[1] must be 1.

- Also, the sum 1*1 + f * (freq_count[f]) == x.

But sum is x, so 1 + f * (k) = x, where k is the number of colors with frequency f. Then, after removing the 1, sum is x-1 = f *k, which must be equal to (k) * f. Which it is. So all elements have frequency f, which is equal.

So for example, in the input 5 where all elements are distinct (each frequency 1). Then, x=5 is allowed because after removing one, all have frequency 1.

Wait, no. Wait, in that case, when x=5, the frequencies are all 1, so the condition is case 1. But case 2 is when there is exactly one frequency 1 and others have the same. So for x=5, the case 1 applies.

So the cases are:

Case 1: All elements have frequency 1. Then, x is valid.

Case 2: There's exactly one element with frequency 1, and all others have the same frequency f. Then, after removing that element, all others have f. The sum x is 1 + f * m, where m is the number of other elements. Then x-1 must be f*m.

Case 3: There's exactly one element with frequency m, and all others have frequency m-1. Then, after removing one occurrence of that element, all elements have m-1. The sum x is m + (m-1)*k, where k is the number of other elements. So x-1 = (m-1) + (m-1)*k = (m-1)*(k+1). Which must be equal to the sum of frequencies after removal.

So, how to check these cases.

So, during processing each x, after updating the counts and freq_count, check the following possibilities:

Check if any of the following is true:

1. All elements have frequency 1. So, freq_count has only one entry with key 1, and its value is x (since sum of 1 * x = x). So, (len(freq_count) == 1) and (1 in freq_count) and (freq_count[1] == x). This would imply that all elements are unique. So x can be any length, but after removing one, all elements have frequency 1.

2. There is exactly one element with frequency 1, and the rest have frequency f. So, freq_count must have keys 1 and f, with freq_count[1] == 1, and the sum 1 + f * (freq_count[f]) == x. Then, after removing the 1, sum is x-1 = f * (freq_count[f]), which would mean all elements have frequency f.

3. There is exactly one element with frequency m (the maximum frequency), and all others have frequency m-1. So, the maximum frequency is m. Then, freq_count[m] must be 1, and freq_count[m-1] must be some number k. Then, the sum is m + (m-1)*k. After removing one occurrence of the max element, sum is (m-1) + (m-1)*k = (m-1)(k+1) = x-1. Which should equal the sum of the remaining frequencies, which is (m-1) * (k + 1). Which is correct.

Additionally, there's the case where all elements have the same frequency except one element which has frequency 1, but that's covered in case 2.

So for each x, after updating the counts, we need to check these three conditions.

But how to check them efficiently.

Let's think about the steps in code.

We can track:

- A dictionary count that maps each color to its current frequency.

- A dictionary freq_count that maps each frequency to the number of colors that have that frequency.

For each color in the sequence up to x, we process it:

When adding the color:

prev_count = count.get(color, 0)

if prev_count in freq_count:

    freq_count[prev_count] -= 1

    if freq_count[prev_count] == 0:

        del freq_count[prev_count]

new_count = prev_count + 1

count[color] = new_count

freq_count[new_count] = freq_count.get(new_count, 0) + 1

Then, after this, we check the possible conditions.

Now, for the current x (which is i+1, since we are processing the i-th element in 0-based index), we need to check if any of the three cases apply.

So, for the current x (i+1), check:

Case 1: All elements have frequency 1. So, freq_count must be {1: x}, which implies that the sum of 1*x is x. So len(freq_count) == 1, and 1 in freq_count, and freq_count[1] == x.

Case 2: There is exactly one element with frequency 1, and the rest have frequency f. So, in the freq_count, there are two keys: 1 and f. freq_count[1] is 1. The sum is 1*1 + f*(freq_count[f]) = x. Which is 1 + f * (k) = x. And x-1 must be f*k, which is 1 + f*k -1 = f*k. So the sum after removal is x-1 = f*k, which is the sum of the frequencies (all have f).

So, in code:

if 1 in freq_count and freq_count[1] == 1:

    # Check if the remaining frequencies are all the same.

    # So, there's one 1, and others are f.

    # The sum must be 1 + f * (other count) = x.

    # So, the other keys must be a single f.

    # So, the keys are 1 and f.

    keys = list(freq_count.keys())

    if len(keys) == 2:

        # one is 1, the other is f.

        f1, f2 = keys

        if f1 == 1:

            f = f2

        else:

            f = f1

        if 1 + f * (freq_count[f]) == x:

            return True

Case 3: There is one element with frequency m (max), and others have m-1.

So, the frequencies are m and m-1.

So, the freq_count has m and m-1 as keys.

freq_count[m] must be 1.

Also, the sum m + (m-1)*k = x, where k is the number of elements with m-1.

Then, after removing one occurrence of m, sum becomes m-1 + (m-1)*k = (m-1)(k+1) = x-1.

So, in code:

max_freq = max(freq_count.keys())

if freq_count.get(max_freq, 0) == 1:

    # Check if the remaining frequencies are all max_freq -1.

    remaining_freq = max_freq -1

    if remaining_freq ==0:

        # All others are zero? So, the sum is max_freq (which is 1) and others are 0.

        # Wait, if remaining_freq is 0, then the other elements have frequency 0. But in the current x, their count is 0? That's not possible.

        # Because we process each color as it's added. So if a color has frequency 0, it's not in the count dict.

        # So maybe this is a corner case where there is only one element with max_freq=1, and others have 0 (but that's not possible).

        # So perhaps this case can't happen.

        pass

    else:

        # Check if all other frequencies are remaining_freq.

        # So, the freq_count should have max_freq (count 1), and remaining_freq (count k).

        # So, the sum is 1 * max_freq + k * remaining_freq = x.

        # So, we can check if (max_freq) + (remaining_freq) * (freq_count[remaining_freq]) == x.

        # Also, the remaining_freq must be max_freq -1.

        if (max_freq + (remaining_freq) * freq_count.get(remaining_freq, 0)) == x:

            return True

So, for example, when x=6, and the sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,2], then the frequencies are 3 for 1 and 2, each. So after processing x=6, the freq_count is {3:2}. So case 3 isn't met. But in the sample input 6 (the last sample), the output is 5. Let's see. The input is 6 days: 1,1,1,2,2,2.

So x=5: after 5 days, the counts are 3,2. So freq_count is {3:1, 2:1}.

Then, the max_freq is 3. freq_count[3] is 1. The remaining_freq is 2. So sum is 3 + 2*1 =5. Which equals x=5.

So case 3 is satisfied. So x=5 is valid. So the code would check:

max_freq is 3.

freq_count[3] is 1.

remaining_freq is 2.

sum: 3 + 2 * (freq_count[2] which is 1) â†’ 3+2=5, which equals x=5. So yes.

So the condition is met. So x=5 is valid.

So this would trigger case 3.

Thus, the code would include x=5 as a valid candidate.

So, for each x, after updating the counts and freq_count, we check these three cases. If any is true, then x is a valid candidate, and we can update the maximum answer.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

We need to track count and freq_count for each color as we process the input.

For each step (each x from 1 to n), after processing the color, we check the three conditions.

But how to efficiently check these conditions.

Let's structure the code as follows:

Initialize:

count = defaultdict(int)

freq_count = defaultdict(int)

max_answer = 0

for i in range(n):

    color = u[i]

    # Update count and freq_count

    prev_count = count[color]

    if prev_count in freq_count:

        freq_count[prev_count] -= 1

        if freq_count[prev_count] == 0:

            del freq_count[prev_count]

    new_count = prev_count +1

    count[color] = new_count

    freq_count[new_count] +=1

    # Now check if current x (i+1) is valid.

    x = i+1

    valid = False

    # Case 1: all elements have frequency 1.

    if len(freq_count) ==1 and 1 in freq_count and freq_count[1] ==x:

        valid = True

    else:

        # Check case 2 and 3.

        # Case 2: exactly one element with 1, others same.

        if 1 in freq_count and freq_count[1] ==1:

            # Check the remaining frequencies are same.

            # freq_count must have exactly two keys: 1 and f.

            if len(freq_count) ==2:

                # get the other frequency.

                keys = list(freq_count.keys())

                f = keys[0] if keys[0] !=1 else keys[1]

                if (1 + f * (freq_count[f])) == x:

                    valid = True

        # Case 3: one element with max_freq, others max_freq-1.

        # Get the maximum frequency.

        if not valid and len(freq_count) <=2:

            # len(freq_count) can be 1 or 2.

            max_freq = max(freq_count.keys())

            if freq_count.get(max_freq, 0) ==1:

                # remaining frequency is max_freq -1.

                remaining_freq = max_freq -1

                if remaining_freq ==0:

                    # Then, after removing one occurrence, the remaining is zero.

                    # So all elements except one have 0.

                    # But since other elements can't have 0 (they are in the count dict only if count>0).

                    # So this case is possible only when there's one element with frequency 1.

                    # which is covered in case 1.

                    pass

                else:

                    if (max_freq + remaining_freq * freq_count.get(remaining_freq,0)) == x:

                        valid = True

    if valid:

        max_answer = max(max_answer, x)

So, this code would check each case.

But how to handle the cases where freq_count has more than two keys. For example, if there are three different frequencies, then none of the cases can be met, so x is invalid.

Thus, in the code, after updating the counts, for each x, check:

First, case 1. If not, check case 2 (requires exactly two frequencies, one of which is 1). Then check case 3 (requires either one or two frequencies, with the max being one more than the other).

But in code, the 'len(freq_count) <=2' condition can be checked before case 3.

Wait, in case 3, the frequencies can be in two cases: all have the same frequency, which is (max_freq-1) except one element. So, the freq_count would have two keys: max_freq and max_freq-1.

Or, if the max_freq is 1, then all elements have frequency 1. Which is case 1.

But case 3 is when there is exactly one element with max_freq, and the others have max_freq-1.

So, the code for case 3 needs to check if:

- There's exactly one color with max_freq.

- All other colors have max_freq-1.

But how to check this.

If freq_count has two keys: max_freq and (max_freq-1), and the count for max_freq is 1, then the other key is (max_freq-1), and sum is max_freq + (max_freq-1)*freq_count[max_freq-1] = x.

So in code, we can check:

if len(freq_count) <=2:

    # possible case for case 3.

    max_freq = max(freq_count.keys())

    if freq_count.get(max_freq, 0) ==1:

        # the remaining frequency is max_freq-1.

        # check if the sum is x.

        remaining = max_freq -1

        if remaining ==0:

            # then, after removing, sum is (max_freq-1) * (count of remaining) + (max_freq-1)

            # but if remaining is zero, then all other colors have 0, but that's impossible.

            pass

        else:

            sum_total = max_freq + remaining * (freq_count.get(remaining,0))

            if sum_total == x:

                valid = True

So, this would cover the case.

Now, let's test this code with some examples.

First example:

Input:

13

1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5

After processing all 13 days, the counts are 3 for 1,2,3,4, and 1 for 5.

So freq_count is {3:4, 1:1} (since 4 colors have 3, one has 1).

So case 2 would apply here. So:

Check if 1 is in freq_count (yes), and freq_count[1] is 1 (yes). Then, len(freq_count) is 2. The other frequency is 3. So 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 ==x. So yes. So case 2 is satisfied, so x=13 is valid.

Second example:

5

10 100 20 200 1

After processing 5 days, all counts are 1. So case 1 applies. So x=5 is valid.

Third example:

1

100000 â†’ x=1. case 1: yes.

Fourth example:

7

3 2 1 1 4 5 1 â†’ x=6.

After processing 6 days (indices 0-5):

The sequence is 3,2,1,1,4,5.

The counts are:

3:1, 2:1, 1:2,4:1,5:1.

So freq_count is {1:4, 2:1}.

So check case 2:

1 is present, freq_count[1] is 4, which is not 1. So case 2 no.

Check case3:

max_freq is 2. freq_count[2] is 1.

remaining_freq is 1.

sum is 2 + 1 * 4 =6. Which equals x=6. So yes. So case3 is satisfied. So x=6 is valid.

Thus, code would return 6.

Another example:

6

1 1 1 2 2 2 â†’ x=5.

At x=5, counts are 3 for 1, 2 for 2. So freq_count is {3:1, 2:1}.

Case3: max_freq=3. freq_count[3] is 1.

remaining_freq=2. sum is 3 + 2*1=5. Yes. So valid.

Thus code would mark x=5 as valid.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case: x=1. Valid, as case1.

Another case: x=2, colors [1,1]. Then, counts: {1:2}. freq_count {2:1}.

Check case3: max_freq is 2. freq_count[2] is 1. remaining_freq is 1. sum is 2 +1*0 (since freq_count[1] is 0). 2+0=2=x. So yes. So case3 would trigger. So x=2 is valid. So after removing one occurrence of 1, the count is 1. So valid.

So the answer for x=2 is 2.

But according to the problem statement, after removing exactly one day, all remaining colors must have the same count. For x=2, after removing one day (of 1), the remaining count is 1 (for 1). So valid. So yes, x=2 is valid.

Another edge case: x=3, colors [1,1,2]. Then counts are 2,1. freq_count is {1:1, 2:1}.

Check case2: 1 is present once. The other frequency is 2. sum 1*1 + 2*1=3=x. So case2 is satisfied. So valid. So x=3 is valid. After removing the 2, counts are 2 for 1, which is valid.

Another example: x=3, colors [1,2,2]. Then counts are 1 and 2. freq_count {1:1, 2:1}. case2 applies. sum 1+2*1=3. So valid. Remove the 1, the remaining are 2s. So valid.

So code works.

Now, let's code this.

But let's think about optimizing the code. For each x, checking these cases should be O(1), since the maximum number of keys in freq_count is 2 (for the valid cases), and other cases are not considered.

So the code should run in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e5.

Now, implement this in Python.

But need to use data structures that allow efficient updates and checks.

Use defaultdict from collections for count and freq_count.

But in Python, the max() function over a dictionary's keys is O(k), where k is the number of keys. But in the valid cases, the number of keys is up to 2, so this is O(1). For invalid cases where the number of keys is more than 2, the code will not check case3 (since len(freq_count) would be >2 and thus case3's len check would fail).

So for case3, the code checks len(freq_count) <=2. So, if the number of keys is more than 2, then case3 is not checked.

Thus, for each x, the code runs in O(1) time.

Now, code:

Read n.

Read the array u.

Initialize count as a default dict (int), and freq_count as a default dict (int).

max_answer =0.

loop over each color in u (i from 0 to n-1):

    current_color = u[i]

    prev_count = count[current_color]

    if prev_count in freq_count:

        freq_count[prev_count] -=1

        if freq_count[prev_count] ==0:

            del freq_count[prev_count]

    new_count = prev_count +1

    count[current_color] = new_count

    freq_count[new_count] +=1

    x = i+1

    valid = False

    # check case1

    if len(freq_count) ==1:

        key = next(iter(freq_count))

        if key ==1 and freq_count[key] ==x:

            valid = True

    else:

        # case2

        if 1 in freq_count and freq_count[1] ==1:

            if len(freq_count) ==2:

                other_freq = [k for k in freq_count if k !=1][0]

                if (1 + other_freq * freq_count[other_freq]) ==x:

                    valid = True

        # case3

        if not valid and len(freq_count) <=2:

            max_freq = max(freq_count.keys())

            if freq_count[max_freq] ==1:

                remaining = max_freq -1

                sum_total = max_freq + remaining * freq_count.get(remaining, 0)

                if sum_total ==x:

                    valid = True

    if valid:

        if x >max_answer:

            max_answer =x

print(max_answer)
