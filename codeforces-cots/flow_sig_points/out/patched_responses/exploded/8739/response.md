Okay, I need to solve this problem where Bob has to get from the start to the end of a series of terrain segments, using different movement types, while managing his stamina. The goal is to find the minimal time possible. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem's constraints are tight. n can be up to 1e5, and each segment length can be up to 1e12, which suggests that any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. So we need an O(n) or O(n log something) algorithm.

Let's start by understanding the problem. Bob can switch movement types at any point. For each segment, depending on the terrain, he can use certain movement types. For example, on grass (G), he can walk or fly. On water (W), he can swim or fly. On lava (L), he can only fly. But flying costs stamina, while walking and swimming give stamina. The initial stamina is 0.

The key here is to model the optimal path that uses a combination of these movements to minimize time, while ensuring that stamina never goes negative. 

Hmm. So for each segment, Bob can choose to walk/swim as much as possible (since they are slower but give stamina), and fly where necessary, but he might need to accumulate enough stamina before certain segments (like lava) where flying is the only option.

Let's break down each terrain type:

- Grass (G): allowed to walk or fly. Walking takes longer (5s/m) but gives stamina. Flying is 1s/m but uses stamina.
- Water (W): allowed to swim or fly. Swimming is 3s/m, gives stamina. Flying again uses stamina.
- Lava (L): must fly. So here, each meter flown uses 1 stamina. But since lava can't be walked/swum, the stamina must be sufficient to cover the entire segment. Or maybe not? Because if he can fly part of the way and then manage stamina by backtracking? Wait, no. Because the lava is a single segment. So Bob has to fly over the entire lava segment. But wait, the problem says that Bob can change direction at any time. Wait, but he needs to reach Alice's nest, which is to the right of the last segment. So he can't go back once he's passed a segment. Or can he?

Wait, no. The journey is a straight line. Bob starts to the left of the first segment, and needs to reach to the right of the last. So he can't go back once he passes a segment. Because moving left would take him away from the goal. So perhaps the path must be strictly from left to right. Because any backtracking would add unnecessary distance. Wait, but maybe backtracking on a segment (like going back and forth) could allow him to accumulate stamina. For example, in the third sample input, Bob swims the entire water segment (1m), then realizes he doesn't have enough stamina for the lava (2m). So he swims back half a meter and forward again, gaining 1 stamina each way (0.5m back and 0.5m forward, total 1m, giving +1 stamina). Then he can fly over the 2m lava with 2 stamina.

So the idea is that in some segments (like water or grass), Bob can move back and forth to generate stamina, which can then be used to fly over lava segments. But this has to be considered in the model.

But how to model this optimally. Let's think in terms of each segment and the required actions.

The problem requires that for each segment, we need to decide how much to walk/swim (which gives stamina) and how much to fly (which uses stamina), but also consider possible backtracking within a segment to generate stamina. However, backtracking would take time, so we need to find the minimal time possible.

An alternative approach is to model the problem by tracking the current stamina and the maximum possible stamina that can be accumulated up to a certain point. Since backtracking is allowed but time-consuming, perhaps we can precompute the necessary stamina reserves required for future segments and determine how much stamina must be accumulated before those segments.

Let me think of this as a state problem. For each segment, we can calculate the minimal time and the stamina after processing that segment, considering the possible ways to traverse it. But given that n is up to 1e5, this approach might not be feasible unless each step can be handled in O(1) time.

Another approach is to process the segments from left to right, keeping track of two key variables: the current stamina and the maximum possible stamina that could be accumulated up to that point. Wait, perhaps the maximum stamina is the key here. Because to fly over a lava segment, you need enough stamina. So the strategy is to accumulate as much stamina as possible in the earlier segments (grass and water) to use later.

So the algorithm should process each segment and track:

- The accumulated stamina from walking/swimming in previous segments, minus any used in flying.
- The maximum possible stamina that can be generated from the current and previous segments, which can be used for future flying.

But how to model this. Let's consider each segment step by step.

Let's consider that for each segment, depending on its type, the optimal strategy is different.

For Grass (G):

- Bob can walk (gain stamina) or fly (lose stamina). Walking is slower, but gives stamina which may be needed for later segments. So for grass, perhaps the optimal is to walk as much as possible, except when flying allows to save time and we have enough stamina.

But when would it be better to fly on grass? Only if the time saved is worth more than the stamina lost. For example, if after flying, the stamina is sufficient for future needs. So this requires knowing future segments.

But this seems difficult. Maybe the optimal approach is to walk on grass and water as much as possible to generate maximum stamina, then use that stamina to fly over lava and parts of other segments.

But then, when there is a lava segment ahead, we need to have enough stamina to fly over it. If not, we have to generate more stamina by backtracking in previous segments.

But backtracking in previous segments would require time. So the key is to model the minimal time required to generate the necessary stamina for the lava segments.

Wait, but backtracking within a segment (like the third example) can generate stamina. So perhaps the algorithm should track, for each segment, the maximum possible stamina that can be generated from that segment, considering possible backtracking.

Alternatively, we can model for each segment the minimal time required, given the current stamina and the requirements from future segments.

But this seems complex. Let's look for patterns.

For each segment, the possible options are:

1. If the terrain is grass or water:

   a. Walk/swim the entire segment: time is 5 or 3 per meter, stamina increases by the length.

   b. Fly over part or all of the segment: time is 1 per meter, stamina decreases by that part.

   However, flying here would use up stamina that might be needed later. So unless there's a need to save time (i.e., the time saved by flying is worth the stamina cost), it's better to walk/swim.

   But perhaps in some cases, flying a part of the segment can save time and allow building up enough stamina for a later lava segment.

   But how to model this.

2. If the terrain is lava:

   a. Must fly the entire segment. So for each meter, use 1 stamina, and the stamina can't drop below zero.

   So for a lava segment of length L, the required stamina is at least L. If the current stamina is less than L, we need to generate the difference by backtracking in previous segments.

   So the problem becomes: for each lava segment, compute the deficit in stamina (max(0, L - current_stamina)), and then find how to generate that deficit in previous segments.

But backtracking in previous segments will cost time. So for each such deficit, we need to compute how much time it would take to generate the required stamina via backtracking, and add that to the total time.

But how?

Let's try to model this step by step.

Initialize stamina = 0, total_time = 0.

For each segment from left to right:

   If the segment is G or W:

      The best way to move through is to walk/swim as much as possible, as that gives stamina. But in some cases, flying might be better if it allows to save time and the stamina is sufficient.

      Wait, but flying would reduce stamina, which could be a problem for future segments.

      So perhaps, in general, for G and W segments, we should walk/swim the entire segment to maximize stamina gain, unless there's a future need to fly (like a lava segment) that requires more stamina than we can generate. In such cases, maybe we need to fly part of the current segment to save time, but that's only if the overall time saved is worth it.

      Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to walk/swim as much as possible, and then, when a lava segment is encountered, check if we have enough stamina. If not, compute how much more stamina is needed and adjust the previous segments to generate that stamina via backtracking.

But how to adjust previous segments.

Let's consider that each G or W segment can be used to generate stamina. The maximum possible stamina from a segment is equal to its length (if walked/swam). But if backtracking is allowed, like moving back and forth in a segment, the stamina can be increased by 1 per meter walked/swam (since each meter in any direction adds stamina).

So, for example, a segment of length L can generate up to any amount of stamina by moving back and forth multiple times. But each meter moved in any direction adds 1 stamina but takes time (5 or 3 seconds per meter). So generating S stamina would take S * (5 or 3) seconds.

But this can't be right. Because moving back and forth would require moving, say, X meters forward and X meters backward, which gives 2X stamina but takes 2X * (5 or 3) seconds. So for S=2X, the time is 2X * (5 or 3) seconds. But for a required S stamina, the time would be (S) * (5 or 3) seconds.

Wait, no. For example, moving 0.5 meters forward and then 0.5 meters backward gives 1 stamina (0.5 + 0.5 = 1 meter walked), and the time is 5*(0.5 +0.5) = 5 seconds. So 5 seconds per 1 stamina. Similarly for swimming, it's 3 seconds per stamina.

So the cost per stamina from grass is 5 seconds, and from water is 3 seconds.

So when we need to generate S stamina, the minimal cost is to generate it from the cheapest possible source. That is, prefer to generate it from water segments (since 3 seconds per stamina) over grass (5 per stamina). So for example, if we have a water segment and a grass segment, to generate S stamina, we should first use the water segment (if available) to generate as much as possible, then use grass.

So the idea is:

- For each segment, when we need to generate extra stamina (for example, to cover a lava segment), we can generate that stamina by backtracking in previous G and W segments, but choosing the segments with the lowest cost per stamina first.

Thus, whenever a deficit in stamina is encountered (e.g., when a lava segment requires more stamina than currently available), we need to compute how much additional stamina is needed, and then find the minimal time to generate that stamina by backtracking in previous segments, prioritizing water segments (3s per stamina) over grass (5s).

So the algorithm would:

1. Process each segment in order.

2. Keep track of the current stamina.

3. For each G or W segment, add its length to the current stamina (since we walk/swim through it), and accumulate the time.

4. When a lava segment is encountered:

   a. Check if current stamina is >= L. If yes, subtract L from stamina, add L * 1 seconds to time.

   b. If not, compute deficit = L - current_stamina.

   c. Need to generate deficit stamina by backtracking in previous G and W segments.

   d. The minimal cost is to take as much as possible from the cheapest (water) segments first, then grass.

   e. So, the total time added for generating deficit stamina is deficit * (3 if there are W segments available, else 5) ?

   Wait, not exactly. Because each previous W and G segment can contribute as much as needed, but each has a cost per stamina. So if there are multiple W and G segments, the optimal is to take as much as possible from W (since 3s per stamina) first, then from G (5s). 

   So the idea is to keep track of all the W and G segments that can be used to generate stamina. For each such segment, we can use any amount of stamina (since backtracking allows us to generate any amount, but each unit of stamina takes 3 or 5 seconds).

   Therefore, the minimal time to generate S stamina is S multiplied by the minimal cost (3 if any W segments are present, else 5).

   Wait, but if there are both W and G segments, then to generate S stamina, the best is to generate as much as possible from W (cost 3) and the rest from G (5).

   So for example, if there are W segments, then the cost per stamina is 3. So the total time to generate S stamina is S * 3, provided that there is at least one W segment. But this may not be correct. Because even if there is one W segment, the total stamina that can be generated from that segment is unlimited (since we can backtrack any number of times), so all S can be generated from that W segment, leading to 3*S cost.

But this is only possible if the W segment exists. So for example, if there are multiple W and G segments, the optimal is to generate all required stamina from the W segments (since they are cheaper) regardless of their positions.

So the minimal cost to generate S stamina is S multiplied by the minimal cost available in the previous segments (i.e., 3 if any W segments have been encountered before the current lava, else 5 if there are G segments, else impossible. But the problem states that the first segment is not L, so there must be at least one G or W segment before any lava? Not necessarily. For example, a lava can be the second segment, but the first is G or W. So in that case, there are previous segments.

So whenever we need to generate S stamina, the minimal cost is 3 * S if there exists at least one W segment before the current lava. Otherwise, if there's a G segment, then 5 * S. But since the first segment is not lava, there's at least one G or W before the first lava, so we can generate the required stamina.

But how do we track whether there are W segments before a given lava segment?

We can keep track of two flags: has_water (whether any W segment has been processed before the current lava) and has_grass (if any G has been processed). But since W is cheaper than G, we prefer to use W.

So during the processing of segments, whenever we encounter a W, we set a flag that there's at least one W in the past. Similarly for G. So when processing a lava segment, we check if there's any W in the processed segments. If yes, then the cost per stamina is 3. Else, it's 5.

Thus, for a deficit S, the minimal time to generate S is S * 3 (if W exists) or S *5 (if only G exists).

But in the third example:

Input is 2 segments: 1 (W), then 2 (L).

Bob's path is:

- Swim 1m, time 3s, stamina becomes 1.

- Now, needs to fly 2m. But current stamina is 1. So deficit is 1.

So he needs to generate 1 stamina. The previous segments are W. So cost is 3 per stamina. So 1 *3 =3 seconds. So total time would be 3 (swim) + 3 (backtrack) + 2 (fly) =8, which matches the sample.

Wait, the sample's time is 8. Let's see:

Original steps:

He swims the entire 1m (3s, stamina 1). Then, he needs to fly 2m, which costs 2 stamina. But he only has 1. So deficit is 1. So he has to generate 1 stamina via backtracking. Since the W segment is there, it's 3s per stamina. So 3 *1=3s. Then, fly 2m (2s). Total time 3+3+2=8.

So the calculation is correct.

But in that scenario, the backtracking is done on the W segment. So the idea is that whenever a deficit occurs, we can compute the deficit multiplied by the minimal cost per stamina (3 if any W exists, else 5).

But how to track whether there are W segments before the current lava.

So during processing the segments, we can track two variables: the number of W segments encountered so far, and the number of G segments. Alternatively, just track whether there is at least one W.

So here's the plan:

We process each segment in order. For each segment:

- If it's G or W:

   - We walk/swim through it, adding the length to stamina, and adding time accordingly (5*L for G, 3*L for W). Also, mark if it's a W (so that in case of future deficits, we can use the cheaper cost).

   - Also, track whether there has been any W segments before the current position. So we can have a variable 'has_water' which is True if any W has been encountered up to that point.

   For example, when we process a W, set has_water to True.

- If it's L:

   - The required stamina is the length of the segment. If current stamina >= L: subtract L from stamina, add L *1 to time.

   - Else:

      - deficit = L - stamina.

      - Add deficit * (3 if has_water else 5) to the time.

      - Also, add the time for flying the entire L segment (L *1).

      - Set stamina to 0 (since after flying, the stamina is (stamina before flying) - L. But since we had a deficit, the stamina before flying was < L, so after flying, stamina would be negative, which is not allowed. So we need to generate enough stamina to cover the deficit, making the total stamina zero after flying. Because after generating the deficit, the stamina becomes (current_stamina + deficit) - L. But current_stamina + deficit = L. So after flying, it's zero.)

Wait, let's see:

Original stamina is S. Deficit is D = L - S.

So we need to generate D stamina. Which is added to the current S, making S + D = S + (L - S) = L.

Then, flying the L meters subtracts L, so stamina becomes 0.

Yes.

So after generating the D stamina, the time increases by D * cost (3 or 5). Then, the time for flying L meters is L *1. So total time for the lava segment is D * cost + L *1.

But what about the current stamina? After this, stamina is zero.

So when processing a lava segment with deficit, we set stamina to zero after flying.

So in code:

For L segment of length L:

if stamina >= L:

   time += L

   stamina -= L

else:

   deficit = L - stamina

   cost = 3 if has_water else 5

   time += deficit * cost

   time += L

   stamina = 0

But wait, in the sample input 3, after generating the deficit, the time is 3 (swim) + 3 (deficit) + 2 (fly) = 8. Which matches.

Yes.

So this approach would handle that case.

But then, what about segments after the lava? Suppose there is a lava segment, and after that a grass segment. But the stamina is zero. So for the grass, we can walk, which gives stamina.

But the problem is that the algorithm processes segments in order. So for a lava segment, the processing is done as above. Then, for the next segments, the algorithm proceeds.

But what about other types of terrain after lava? For example, if after a lava segment there's a grass segment, then Bob can walk on it, gaining stamina again.

So the algorithm should handle that.

Now, what about when there's a segment that is not lava but needs to fly over some parts for optimal time? For example, a grass segment where flying part of it saves time, but uses stamina that could be needed later.

But according to the current approach, the algorithm would walk the entire grass segment, gaining stamina. But maybe it's better to fly part of it, thus saving time but losing stamina, but overall, the time saved is more than the time needed to generate the deficit later.

But how do we account for that?

For example, suppose there's a grass segment followed by a lava segment. If we walk the entire grass segment, time is 5*L1, stamina is L1. Then, lava segment of L2, which requires L2 stamina. If L1 >= L2, then time is 5L1 + L2. But if L1 < L2, then we have a deficit (L2-L1), which costs (3 if any W exists before, else 5) * deficit. But in this case, the previous segments include the grass segment, but no W. So cost is 5*deficit.

Alternatively, suppose we fly part of the grass segment. For example, fly X meters, then walk (L1-X). Time is X*1 + (L1 - X)*5. Stamina is (L1 - X) - X = L1 - 2X. Then, when we get to the lava segment, the required stamina is L2. So:

L1 - 2X >= L2 ?

If possible, then we could save time.

For example, if L1=10, L2=15. Then, by flying 5 meters and walking 5:

Time is 5*1 +5*5=5+25=30. Stamina is 5 -5=0. Then, lava needs 15, deficit is 15. Cost is 5*15=75. Total time is 30+75 +15 = 120.

Alternatively, walking all 10 meters:

Time 50. Stamina 10. Lava requires 15: deficit 5. Cost 5*5=25. Time 50+25+15=90. So better.

So in this case, it's better to walk the entire grass segment.

Thus, flying on grass is only beneficial if the time saved by flying is greater than the cost of generating the deficit caused by losing stamina.

But in the above example, flying on grass actually makes the deficit larger, leading to a higher cost. So the initial approach of walking all grass and swimming all water is better.

Therefore, perhaps the optimal approach is to always walk/swim on non-lava segments to maximize stamina gain, and only generate the necessary deficit when encountering a lava segment.

But how to confirm this? Let's take another example.

Suppose we have a grass segment of length 5, followed by a lava segment of length 6. No W segments.

If we walk the entire grass: time 25, stamina 5. Then, lava requires 6. Deficit is 1. Cost 5*1=5. Total time 25+5 +6 =36.

Alternatively, fly 1 meter of grass (time 1) and walk 4 (time 20). Total time 21. Stamina is 4-1=3. Lava needs 6: deficit 3. Cost 5*3=15. Time 21+15+6=42. Worse.

So it's better to walk all.

Another example: grass of 10, lava of 5.

Walk all: time 50. Stamina 10. Deficit 0. Fly 5. Total time 55. Which is better than any alternative.

Another example: grass of 3, lava of 5.

Walking all: time 15, stamina 3. Deficit 2. Cost 5*2=10. Time total 15+10+5=30.

If fly 1 meter of grass (time 1), then walk 2 (time 10). Time 11. Stamina 2-1=1. Deficit 4. Cost 5*4=20. Time 11+20+5=36. Worse.

Thus, in all cases, walking all non-lava segments is better.

What about a case where there's a W segment after a G segment, and then a lava segment. Suppose:

G (5m), W (5m), L (12m).

Processing:

G: walk 5m. Time 25. Stamina 5.

W: swim 5m. Time 15. Stamina 10.

L: 12m. Stamina 10 >=12? No. Deficit 2. Has_water is True. Cost 3*2=6. Total time 25+15 +6 +12= 58.

Alternatively, fly part of the G segment. Suppose fly 2 meters of G (time 2), walk 3 (15). Time 17. Stamina 3 -2 +5 (from W) = 6. Then L needs 12. Deficit 6. Cost 3*6=18. Total time 17 +15 (swim W) +18 +12=62. Worse than the original approach.

So again, walking all is better.

So the conclusion is that, for non-lava segments, the optimal is to walk/swim the entire segment to maximize stamina, and only generate the deficit when necessary for lava segments. Thus, the initial approach is correct.

Thus, the algorithm would proceed as follows:

- Keep track of current stamina (stam), total time (time), and whether there has been any W segments encountered so far (has_water).

- For each segment:

   - If it's G:

      - Add 5 * l to time.

      - Add l to stam.

   - If it's W:

      - Add 3 * l to time.

      - Add l to stam.

      - Set has_water to True.

   - If it's L:

      - required = l

      - if stam >= required:

          time += required

          stam -= required

      - else:

          deficit = required - stam

          cost = 3 if has_water else 5

          time += deficit * cost

          time += required

          stam = 0

This approach handles all cases except when there's a lava segment followed by another lava segment, but that's allowed. For example, if two lava segments are consecutive. The first will drain the stamina, then the second will need to generate more deficit.

Wait, but after the first lava, the stamina is zero. The second lava requires l2 stamina. So deficit is l2. Then, the code checks if there's any W before. So if the first lava is the third segment, but there are W segments in the first and second segments (but the third is L), then the code will use the W segments (has_water is True) to generate the deficit for the third segment. But the fourth segment is another L. Then, processing the fourth segment:

current stam is zero, required l4. deficit is l4. cost is 3 (since has_water is True). So time increases by l4*3 + l4.

But the code's 'has_water' remains True even after processing the first L segment. Because once a W is encountered, has_water is True forever.

Yes. Because once a W is processed, has_water is set to True and remains so for all future segments.

Thus, any subsequent lava segments will use the cheapest cost (3) for generating deficit, as long as there's at least one W in any previous segment.

Thus, this approach is correct.

Now, testing against the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

1

10

G

Processing:

Segment is G, l=10.

Add 50 to time (5*10). Stam becomes 10.

Then, end. No lava. So total time is 50. But the sample output is 30. Wait, this is a problem. Because according to the sample explanation, Bob walks 5 meters (25s) and flies 5 (5s) for a total of 30. So our approach is wrong here.

Ah, wait, the sample input is:

The first sample input:

1

10

G

The output is 30.

According to the sample explanation, Bob walks 5 meters (25s) then flies 5 (5s). So in this case, our approach's code would walk the entire 10 meters, giving stam 10, time 50. But the sample shows that flying part of the segment is better. So our initial approach is not correct.

This indicates a flaw in the initial approach. So what's wrong here?

In this case, after the G segment, there's no more segments. But the code walks the entire segment, taking 50 seconds. But the sample shows that flying part of it is better.

So the initial approach is not optimal. So why is that?

Because the code's current logic assumes that for non-lava segments, the entire segment is walked or swam, but in reality, it may be better to fly part of it to save time, even if it reduces stamina, since there's no future segments that require stamina.

Ah, right. Because in this case, after the G segment, Bob needs to reach the end. So he can walk part and fly part. For example, walking x meters and flying (10-x) meters. The time is 5x + (10-x)*1. The stamina after is x - (10-x) = 2x-10. But since there are no future segments, the stamina can be anything (as long as it's not negative during flight). Wait, but during the flight, each meter uses 1 stamina. So for the (10-x) meters flown, the stamina must be >=0 at all times.

Wait, the problem statement says that stamina cannot be negative at any time. So during the flight, each meter flown must be covered by available stamina.

So for the first sample:

He starts at 0 stamina. For the G segment, he can walk x meters (gaining x stamina) and then fly (10-x) meters (using (10-x) stamina). The total time is 5x + (10-x)*1.

But during the flight, the stamina after walking x is x. Then, flying (10-x) meters: the stamina must be >=0 at each step.

So during the flight, the stamina is x - (10-x) = 2x -10. But this has to be >=0.

But wait, during the flight, each meter flown reduces stamina by 1. So after flying (10-x) meters, the stamina is x - (10-x) = 2x-10. But during the flight, each step must have stamina >=0.

So for example, if x=5, then during the flight, he uses 5 stamina. Stamina starts at 5, ends at 0. So all steps are allowed.

But if x=4: after walking 4 meters, stamina is 4. Then, flying 6 meters. After each meter, stamina is 4,3,2,1,0,-1. So the flight is invalid, as stamina becomes negative.

Thus, the flight must not use more stamina than available. So for the flight part of (10-x) meters, the stamina after walking x meters (x) must be >= (10-x) meters. So x >= (10-x) → x >=5.

Thus, x can be between 5 and 10.

So the minimal time is 5x + (10-x), where x >=5.

The minimal occurs when x is as small as possible (5). So x=5, time is 5*5 +5 =30. Which matches the sample.

Thus, the initial approach of walking the entire segment (x=10) would take 50 seconds, which is worse. So the code's logic is incorrect here.

Thus, the initial approach is flawed.

This indicates that for the non-lava segments, especially the last segment, it may be optimal to fly part of the segment to save time, even if it uses stamina. Because there's no future segments, the stamina after that is irrelevant (as long as it's non-negative during flight).

So the algorithm needs to consider that for the last segment (if it's not lava), Bob can fly part of it to minimize time.

Thus, the algorithm must not assume that non-lava segments are completely walked/swam, but instead, consider the optimal split between walking/swimming and flying.

But how to handle this efficiently given the constraints.

This complicates the problem, as now each non-lava segment may have a part walked and a part flown. But with n up to 1e5 and l up to 1e12, we can't process each segment in a way that splits the segments into parts.

Thus, we need a way to model this optimally.

Let's consider each non-lava segment. For each such segment, the optimal strategy is to walk/swim as much as possible, but fly as much as possible (if it reduces time) as long as the stamina allows, considering the future segments. But for the last segment, there are no future segments, so the flying part can be maximized.

But how?

Let me think differently. Let's model the problem by keeping track of the current stamina and the minimal time. For each segment, decide how much to walk and fly, but this seems computationally heavy for 1e5 segments.

Alternative approach:

For each non-lava segment, we can compute the best possible way to traverse it, considering that after this segment, there might be a lava segment requiring certain stamina. But this seems intractable.

Alternatively, we can think of each segment (except the last) as being walked/swam completely, and for the last segment (if non-lava), compute the optimal split between walking and flying.

But this may not be correct, as there might be earlier non-lava segments where flying part of them would save time even if there are future lava segments. But given the time constraints, perhaps this is manageable.

Alternatively, for all segments except the last, walk/swim completely. For the last segment, if it's not lava, compute the minimal time by choosing to walk x meters and fly (L-x) meters, where x is the maximum possible such that stamina_after_walking_x >= (L-x).

But even this may be possible.

Let's take the first sample again. The last segment is G. For this segment, after walking x meters and flying (10-x) meters:

The time is 5x +1*(10-x) =4x +10. To minimize this, x should be as small as possible. The constraint is that x (stamina after walking x) >= (10-x) (because flying (10-x) meters requires (10-x) stamina). So x >= (10-x) → x >=5. So minimal x is 5. Thus, time is 4*5 +10=30.

Thus, for the last segment (non-lava), we can compute the optimal x to minimize the time.

So the algorithm can be modified as follows:

Process all segments except the last as before (walk/swim completely), but for the last segment:

If it's G or W:

   Compute the optimal split between walking/swimming and flying to minimize time.

   The time for this segment is min_time = min over possible x of (cost_walk *x + cost_fly*(L-x)), subject to x >= (L-x) - current_stam_before_this_segment ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

When processing the last segment, which is G or W:

The initial stamina is S (after processing previous segments).

For this segment of length L:

We can choose to walk x meters (cost 5 or 3 *x, gain x stamina) and fly (L-x) meters (cost 1*(L-x), lose (L-x) stamina).

The constraints are:

   x must be between 0 and L.

   The stamina after walking x is S +x.

   Then, during the flying of (L-x) meters, the stamina must not drop below zero. So S +x - (L-x) >=0 → S +x >= L-x → 2x >= L - S → x >= (L - S)/2.

But since x can't be negative, x >= max(0, (L - S)/2).

Also, since x can't exceed L, x is in [max(0, (L-S)/2), L].

The time for this segment is:

walk_cost *x + fly_cost*(L-x) = (5 or 3)*x + (L -x).

We need to find x in the range [max(0, (L - S)/2), L] that minimizes this expression.

This is a linear function in x. The minimal occurs at one of the endpoints of the allowed interval.

The function is (walk_cost - 1)*x + (fly_cost * L) - (fly_cost - walk_cost)*x → no. Wait, walk_cost is 5 or 3. The time is:

For a G segment:

5x + (L -x) =4x + L.

Which is increasing with x. So to minimize, x should be as small as possible.

So x is (L - S)/2 if that is >=0. Otherwise, x is 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the function is 4x + L. Which is increasing. So to minimize, x should be as small as possible.

The allowed x is x >= max(0, (L - S)/2).

So the minimal x is max(0, (L - S)/2).

Thus, the minimal time is 4 * max(0, (L - S)/2) + L.

But wait, how?

Wait, for example:

In the first sample:

S is 10 (from walking the entire segment, according to the initial approach). But the code's initial approach would add 5*10 =50 seconds. But the sample shows that by splitting, time is 30.

Wait, but according to the initial approach, the code would process the G segment as walk, but then the last segment is the same G segment. So the code would process it as walked, but in reality, the optimal is to split.

Thus, the code needs to handle the last segment differently.

Thus, the algorithm needs to:

1. Process all segments except the last as before.

2. For the last segment:

   a. If it's lava: process as before.

   b. If it's G or W:

      i. Compute the optimal split between walking and flying, taking into account the current stamina.

Thus, the code should be modified to handle the last segment separately.

But how to determine whether the current segment is the last one.

So here's the modified approach:

- Process each segment in order, up to the nth segment.

- For segments 1 to n-1:

   process as before.

- For the nth segment:

   process as follows:

   if it's L:

      process as before.

   else:

      compute the optimal split between walking/swimming and flying.

      the current stamina before processing this segment is S.

      then, for this segment of length L and type T (G or W):

         walk_cost = 5 if G else 3.

         fly_cost =1.

         allowed x is the number of meters walked, which must be at least max(0, (L - S)/2).

         x_min = max(0, (L - S +1) // 2)  # since x can be a real number, but the problem allows any point (even non-integer coordinates).

         x can be any value >= x_min and <= L.

         The time for this segment is walk_cost *x + fly_cost*(L -x) = (walk_cost - fly_cost)*x + fly_cost * L.

         To minimize this, since walk_cost - fly_cost is 4 for G and 2 for W, which are positive, the minimal time is achieved when x is as small as possible.

         So x = x_min.

         But x_min is (L - S)/2, but if L - S is negative, then x_min is 0.

         So:

         x = max(0, (L - S)/2 )

         However, x can't exceed L. But since S is the stamina from previous segments, which is >=0.

         So, if (L - S)/2 <=0 → x =0. So the entire segment is flown.

         Wait, but if x=0, then you have to fly L meters. Stamina after previous segments is S. So S >= L → must be true to fly L meters.

         Wait, no. Because when x=0, you are flying the entire segment. So each meter of flight reduces stamina by 1. So stamina must be >=0 at all times. So the initial stamina S must be >= L - x (since x is 0). So S >= L -0 → S >= L. But if x is zero, that's not possible. So this indicates that x_min is not zero in this case.

Wait, perhaps the constraints are:

After processing all previous segments, the stamina is S_prev.

For the last segment (non-lava):

We can choose to walk x meters and fly (L-x) meters.

The constraints are:

   S_prev + x (from walking) must be >= (L -x) (required for flying).

   => S_prev + x >= L -x → 2x >= L - S_prev → x >= (L - S_prev)/2.

   Also, x >=0 and x <= L.

So x must be >= max(0, (L - S_prev)/2).

But x can be a real number (like 5.5 meters walked).

So the minimal time for this segment is when x is as small as possible (since the time function is increasing in x).

So x = max(0, (L - S_prev)/2).

But then:

Time = walk_cost * x + (L -x)*1.

But also, the time is dependent on walk_cost, which is 5 for G, 3 for W.

So for example, in the first sample:

S_prev is 0 (before processing the last segment). The segment is G, L=10.

x_min = max(0, (10 -0)/2 ) =5.

So x=5.

Time for this segment:5*5 +5=30.

Which matches the sample.

Another example: last segment is W, L=10, S_prev=0.

x_min = (10-0)/2=5.

Time:3*5 +5=15+5=20. Which is better than swimming all (3*10=30).

Thus, this approach would correctly handle the last segment.

So the algorithm needs to be modified to handle the last segment differently.

But how to handle this in code?

The steps are:

- Process the first n-1 segments as before (walk/swim completely, update stamina, time, and has_water).

- For the nth segment:

   if it's L:

      process as before.

   else:

      if G:

          walk_cost =5

      else:

          walk_cost=3

      L = l_n

      S_prev = current stamina after n-1 segments.

      x_min = max(0.0, (L - S_prev)/2 )

      x = x_min

      # but x can be up to L.

      # So x = min(x_min, L) ?

      # No, x_min is (L - S_prev)/2. But since S_prev can be large, L - S_prev can be negative.

      # So x_min is max(0, (L - S_prev)/2)

      x = max(0.0, (L - S_prev) / 2 )

      # Ensure x <= L.

      x = min(x, L)

      # compute the time for this segment.

      time += walk_cost * x + (L -x)*1

      # stamina after this segment: S_prev +x (from walking) - (L -x) (from flying)

      # S_new = S_prev + x - (L -x) = S_prev + 2x - L

      # But since x >= (L - S_prev)/2 → 2x >= L - S_prev → 2x - L >= - S_prev → S_prev + 2x - L >=0.

      # So S_new >=0.

      # But since this is the last segment, the stamina is irrelevant.

So, the code needs to handle the last segment as a special case.

Thus, the algorithm can be implemented as follows:

Initialize stamina =0, time=0, has_water=False.

for i in 0 to n-2:

   process the i-th segment (assuming 0-based index)

   if it's G:

      time +=5 * l_i

      stamina += l_i

   elif W:

      time +=3 * l_i

      stamina += l_i

      has_water =True

   else: # L

      required = l_i

      if stamina >= required:

          time += required

          stamina -= required

      else:

          deficit = required - stamina

          cost =3 if has_water else 5

          time += deficit * cost

          time += required

          stamina =0

Then, process the nth segment (the last one):

if s[-1] == 'L':

   required = l[-1]

   if stamina >= required:

       time += required

       stamina -= required

   else:

       deficit = required - stamina

       cost =3 if has_water else5

       time += deficit * cost

       time += required

       stamina=0

else:

   # G or W

   walk_cost =5 if s[-1] == 'G' else 3

   L = l[-1]

   S_prev = stamina

   x_min = max(0.0, (L - S_prev)/2 )

   x = x_min

   if x > L:

       x = L

   time += walk_cost * x + (L -x)*1

   # no need to update stamina as it's the last segment

Thus, this approach should handle the first sample correctly.

But how to compute x as a real number? Because x can be a fractional value, but in code, we can compute it as a float. However, since l_i can be up to 1e12, we need to handle large numbers, but since Python can handle big numbers, this shouldn't be a problem.

Testing this approach against the first sample:

Sample 1:

n=1.

So the first loop (0 to n-2= -1) does not run. Then, the last segment is G.

walk_cost=5.

L=10, S_prev=0.

x_min = max(0, (10-0)/2 )=5.

x=5.

time +=5*5 +5 → 25 +5=30. Which matches the sample.

Sample 3:

Input:

2

1 2

WL

Segments:

First is W, second is L.

Processing:

n=2.

First loop (i=0 to 0):

segment 0 is W, l=1.

time +=3*1=3.

stamina +=1 → 1.

has_water=True.

Then, process the last segment (index 1):

it's L.

required=2.

stamina is 1 <2.

deficit=1.

cost=3 (since has_water is True).

time += 1*3 →3, then add 2.

total time is 3+3+2=8. Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input:

2

10 10

WL

Process first segment (W):

time +=3*10=30. stamina=10. has_water=True.

last segment is L:

required=10. stamina >=10 → yes. time +=10 → total 40. stamina becomes 0.

Which matches the sample.

Sample4:

Input:

3

10 10 10

GLW

Segments:

0: G.

1: L.

2: W.

Wait, no. The input is GLW.

Third line is s = 'GLW', so segments are:

0: G.

1: L.

2: W.

But wait, the last segment is W. So processing:

n=3.

First loop processes segments 0 and 1 (i=0 and 1? No, the loop is from 0 to n-2=1 (since n=3, indices 0,1,2. n-1 is 2, last segment is index 2. The loop runs for i in 0 to 1 (n-2=1). So:

Process segment 0 (G):

time +=5*10=50. stamina=10.

Process segment 1 (L):

required=10. stamina is 10. So time +=10 → total 60. stamina=0.

Then, process the last segment (W):

walk_cost=3.

L=10.

S_prev=0.

x_min = max(0, (10 -0)/2 ) =5.

time +=3*5 + (10-5)*1 → 15 +5=20 → total time 60+20=80. Which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach works for all samples.

Thus, the code needs to be structured to handle the first n-1 segments as before, then handle the last segment specially.

Now, let's code this.

But in code, the segments are given as a list. For the first n-1 segments, process each one. Then process the last segment.

But we need to be careful with 1-based or 0-based indices.

In code:

Read n.

l = list of integers.

s = string of length n.

Then, process the first n-1 segments.

for i in range(n-1):

    terrain = s[i]

    length = l[i]

    process.

Then process the last segment:

terrain = s[-1]

length = l[-1]

if terrain is L: process as before.

else: handle as the last segment.

Thus, the code would be:

n = int(input())
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = input().strip()

stamina = 0
time = 0
has_water = False

for i in range(n-1):
    terrain = s[i]
    length = l[i]
    if terrain == 'G':
        time += 5 * length
        stamina += length
    elif terrain == 'W':
        time += 3 * length
        stamina += length
        has_water = True
    else:  # L
        req = length
        if stamina >= req:
            time += req
            stamina -= req
        else:
            deficit = req - stamina
            cost = 3 if has_water else 5
            time += deficit * cost + req
            stamina = 0

# handle last segment
terrain = s[-1]
length = l[-1]
if terrain == 'L':
    req = length
    if stamina >= req:
        time += req
    else:
        deficit = req - stamina
        cost = 3 if has_water else 5
        time += deficit * cost + req
else:
    walk_cost = 5 if terrain == 'G' else 3
    S_prev = stamina
    L = length
    x_min = max(0.0, (L - S_prev) / 2)
    x = min(x_min, L)
    time += walk_cost * x + (L - x)

print(int(time))

Wait, but x can be a fraction, but in code, multiplying by a float would give a float, but the problem expects an integer output. So, in the sample input 3, where x is 0.5, but multiplied by 3 gives 1.5, adding to other times, which are integers. But the sample output is 8, which is 3 (swim) + 3 (backtrack) + 2 (fly) =8. So how does this code handle fractions?

In the code, the time is accumulated as a float. But the output is printed as an integer. So in cases where the minimal time is not an integer, the code will output a float, but the problem expects it to be an integer. However, all the sample inputs result in integer times, and according to the problem statement, the output is an integer.

But in reality, when x is a fraction, the time can be a non-integer. For example, if x is 0.5 meters walked (in a G segment), the time is 5*0.5 =2.5 seconds. Then flying 0.5 meters would add 0.5 seconds, total 3 seconds. But according to the problem statement, Bob can change direction at any point, including non-integer coordinates. So the time can be a fractional number of seconds, but the problem's output is an integer.

Wait, looking at the problem's output format:

"Output a single integer t — the minimum time Bob needs to reach Alice."

But the examples have integer outputs. However, in reality, the time can be a fractional number, but the problem says to output it as an integer. Is this possible?

Wait, the problem statement says that the output is the minimal time. The time can be a fractional number (e.g., 3.5 seconds), but the output requires it to be printed as an integer. But the sample inputs all have integer outputs, so perhaps the minimal time is always an integer.

But how?

Looking at the problem:

Each movement's time per meter is integer (5,3,1). So the time for any movement is the sum of integers multiplied by the number of meters. But when the number of meters is a fraction, the time can be a fraction. For example, walking 0.5 meters takes 2.5 seconds. But in the code, when x is 0.5, the time added is 0.5*5=2.5.

But in the code, the final time is printed as an integer. So how to handle this?

This indicates that the code needs to handle fractional times and print them as integers. But the sample inputs show that the correct output is an integer. So perhaps the minimal time is always an integer.

But why?

Because when you split the last segment into x and (L-x) meters, the x is chosen such that x = (L - S_prev)/2.

But L and S_prev are integers. So x could be a fractional number.

But the sum walk_cost *x + (L-x) can be a float. For example, if x=0.5, walk_cost=5, then 5*0.5 + 0.5=3 seconds, which is an integer.

Wait, 5*0.5 is 2.5, plus 0.5 (flying) is 3.0. Which is integer.

Wait, in this case, x=0.5:

walking 0.5 meters: 5 *0.5 = 2.5.

flying 0.5 meters: 0.5 *1 =0.5.

Total time:3.0.

Thus, even when x is fractional, the sum is 5x + (L-x) =4x +L. So if L is integer and x is (L - S_prev)/2, which could be (integer - integer)/2, possibly a half-integer.

For example, L=10, S_prev=0: x=5. 4*5 +10=30.

If L=9, S_prev=0: x=4.5 → 4*4.5 +9=18+9=27.

Which is integer.

Thus, whenever x is (L - S_prev)/2, even if L and S_prev are such that L-S_prev is odd, the sum 4x + L will be 4*( (L - S_prev)/2 ) + L = 2*(L - S_prev) + L = 3L - 2S_prev. Which is integer.

Similarly for W segments: walk_cost is 3.

3x + (L-x) = 2x + L. If x= (L-S_prev)/2.

Then, 2*(L-S_prev)/2 + L = (L-S_prev) +L = 2L -S_prev. Which is integer.

Thus, for the last segment, regardless of whether x is integer or not, the time will be integer.

Thus, the code can safely use floating-point arithmetic and cast to integer.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, let's test it against the first sample.

Sample1:

n=1.

Last segment is G.

S_prev=0.

x= (10-0)/2=5.

time +=5*5 +5=25+5=30. Correct.

Sample3:

Last segment is L. After processing the first W segment (1m):

stamina=1.

For the last L segment of 2m:

deficit =2-1=1.

cost=3 (has_water is True).

time +=1*3 +2=5. Previous time is3 → total 3+5=8. Correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, code implementation:

Read n.

Read l as list of integers.

Read s as string.

Process first n-1 segments.

Then last segment.

But code needs to handle the last segment as described.

So the code is as follows:
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = input().strip()

stamina = 0
time = 0
has_water = False

# Process the first n-1 segments
for i in range(n-1):
    terrain = s[i]
    length = l[i]
    if terrain == 'G':
        time += 5 * length
        stamina += length
    elif terrain == 'W':
        time += 3 * length
        stamina += length
        has_water = True
    else:  # 'L'
        req = length
        if stamina >= req:
            time += req
            stamina -= req
        else:
            deficit = req - stamina
            cost = 3 if has_water else 5
            time += deficit * cost + req
            stamina = 0

# Process the last segment
terrain = s[-1]
length = l[-1]
if terrain == 'L':
    req = length
    if stamina >= req:
        time += req
    else:
        deficit = req - stamina
        cost = 3 if has_water else 5
        time += deficit * cost + req
else:
    walk_cost = 5 if terrain == 'G' else 3
    S_prev = stamina
    L = length
    x = max(0.0, (L - S_prev) / 2)
    x = min(x, L)
    time += walk_cost * x + (L - x)

print(int(time))
```
