Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine whether a lever tilts to the left, right, or remains balanced based on the given string. The string has exactly one '^', which is the pivot. All other characters are either digits (weights) or '=' which means nothing there.

So, the key here is to calculate the torque on each side of the pivot. Torque is the product of the mass and the distance from the pivot. The sum of torques on the left and right will determine the direction of tilt.

First, I need to find the position of the pivot. Once I have that, I'll iterate over each character in the string. For each character that's a digit, I calculate its distance from the pivot. Then multiply the digit's value by the distance. Left side (positions before the pivot) will contribute negative torque (since the distance is negative if we consider pivot as the origin), and right side will contribute positive. Wait, or maybe I should think in terms of left torque and right torque.

Wait, the torque due to a weight on the left side of the pivot would cause the lever to tilt left, right if torque on the right is higher. So, let's model this correctly.

The torque for a weight at position i, where the pivot is at p. The distance is (i - p). If i is less than p (left side), then the torque is (p - i) * mass. Because the distance from the pivot is (p - i), and the torque would be mass * distance. If the sum of left torques (from the left side) is greater than the sum of right torques (from the right side), the lever tilts to the left. Otherwise, if right sum is larger, it tilts right. If equal, balance.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the physics. The torque caused by a weight on the left side (to the left of the pivot) would be (pivot position - weight position) multiplied by the mass. Because the torque is calculated as force (mass) multiplied by the lever arm, which is the perpendicular distance from the pivot. So for a weight to the left of the pivot, the lever arm is (p - i), and the torque would be mass * (p - i). Similarly, for a weight to the right of the pivot, the lever arm is (i - p), torque is mass * (i - p).

But the direction of the torque matters. Torque on the left side would cause the lever to tilt counterclockwise (left), and right torque would cause clockwise (right). So the total torque is sum of right torques minus sum of left torques. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The torque due to a left weight is (p - i) * m. Since p is the pivot's position, i < p. So (p - i) is positive. But the direction of the torque is such that a weight on the left side would create a torque that tends to rotate the lever counterclockwise (left side down). The torque on the right is (i - p) * m, which is positive and tends to rotate clockwise (right side down). So when we sum all the torques, if the total is positive (sum of right torques is larger than left), then the lever tilts to the right. If the sum is negative, it tilts to the left. If zero, balance.

Wait, no. Because for a weight on the left, the torque is m * (distance from pivot) but the direction. For example, if a weight is at position 2 and pivot is at 3, the distance is 1. The torque from that weight would cause the left side to go down (since it's left of the pivot). So the torque direction is such that when you sum all torques (left and right), the sign of the sum determines the direction. So if sum of left torques (left of pivot) is greater than sum of right torques (right of pivot), the total torque would be positive (left torques contribute to left-down, right to right-down). Wait, maybe I should model the torque as left torques being positive (causing left tilt) and right as negative, or vice versa.

Alternatively, for each weight, calculate the torque as (i - pivot_pos) * mass. Then sum all those. If the total is positive, that means the net torque is to the right (since a weight to the right has i > pivot, so (i-p) is positive, and their torque contributes to right tilt. A weight to the left has i-p negative, so their torque contributes to left tilt. So if the sum is positive, the right side is heavier and the lever tilts right. If sum is negative, left. If zero, balance.

Yes, that's correct. Because for a weight on the left, i-p is negative, so torque is negative. So sum all (i - p) * m. If sum is positive, right. Negative left. Zero balance.

So the plan is:

1. Find the index of the '^' in the string. Let's call it pivot_pos.

2. Iterate over each character in the string. For each position i:

   a. If the character is a digit (1-9), calculate (i - pivot_pos) * (digit's value). Add this to a total torque sum.

3. After processing all characters, check the total torque:

   - If torque_sum > 0: right tilt.

   - If torque_sum < 0: left tilt.

   - Else: balance.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, considering the input constraints. The string can be up to 1e6 characters. So we need an O(n) solution, which this approach is.

Now, handling the input. The input is a single string. So first, read the input line, then process it.

In Python, strings are zero-indexed? Let's see the examples.

In the first example input:

=^==

So the string is length 4. The pivot is at index 1.

The positions are 0,1,2,3. The bar is from 0 to 3 (since |s| -1 is 3). So each position is a point on the bar.

In this example, all other characters are '=', so their mass is zero. So the torque sum is zero. So output is balance.

So the code will:

Read the string, find the pivot index.

Compute for each character:

If it's a digit, get its value. Then compute (i - pivot) * value, add to the sum.

So, code steps:

Read s = input().strip()

pivot = s.index('^')

sum_torque = 0

for i in range(len(s)):

    c = s[i]

    if c == '^' or c == '=':

        continue

    else:

        # it's a digit. convert to integer.

        mass = int(c)

        torque = (i - pivot) * mass

        sum_torque += torque

Then, compare sum_torque:

if sum_torque > 0: output 'right'

elif sum_torque <0: 'left'

else: 'balance'

Yes. That's the plan.

Now, considering the data types. The problem note says to use 64-bit integers. For example, if the string is 1e6 characters, and each character is '9' except the pivot. Then the maximum torque could be (1e6-1 - pivot) * 9, multiplied by 1e6 terms. Wait, but in the worst case, for a string like 9^999...9, where the pivot is in the middle. So each term could be (i - pivot) *9, and the sum could be O( (n^2) * 9 ), which for n=1e6 would be 1e12 * 1e6 = 1e18. But 64-bit integers can handle that. Because 1e18 is within 2^60 (approx 1e18). So in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem.

So the code is straightforward.

Fourth example: 41^52== â†’ pivot at index 2.

Left side: 4 at 0: (0-2)*4 = -2*4= -8. 1 at 1: (1-2)*1= -1 â†’ sum left: -8-1= -9.

Right side: 5 at 3: (3-2)*5=5. 2 at 4: (4-2)*2=4. Sum right:5+4=9. Total sum: -9 +9 =0 â†’ balance. Correct.

So the code works for the examples.

Now, implement this in Python. The code is straightforward.

But considering the input size. For a string of 1e6 characters, the loop is 1e6 iterations. In Python, this is acceptable as per the time constraints. Each iteration is simple: checking the character, perhaps converting to int and computing (i - pivot) * mass.

So the code is efficient. There's no way to optimize further.

Potential edge cases:

- All weights on left sum to same torque as right. â†’ balance.

- Pivot at the middle, but weights on both sides. Like in the fourth example.

Another edge case: very large numbers. But with Python's handling of big integers, that's not a problem.

So the code should work.

s = input().strip()
pivot = s.index('^')
sum_torque = 0
for i, c in enumerate(s):

if sum_torque > 0:
    print('right')
elif sum_torque < 0:
    print('left')
else:
    print('balance')
```
