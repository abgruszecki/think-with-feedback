Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the problem is about employees in a company structured as a tree. Each employee has a bearing limit, which is the maximum number of their subordinates that can be on vacation before they become displeased. Every day, an employee either leaves or returns from vacation. We need to track how many employees are displeased each day.

Hmm. The key is to efficiently track when adding or removing a vacationing employee affects the counts for their superiors. Because each time an employee's vacation status changes, we have to update the counts for all their ancestors. Then, check if any of those ancestors are now over their t_i limit and not on vacation themselves.

But with n and m up to 1e5, a naive approach of traversing the tree for each query would be O(m * depth of the tree), which in the worst case (like a chain) is O(mn) which is 1e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but how do we track for each employee how many of their subordinates are currently on vacation? And then for each of their ancestors, check if the count exceeds t_i, but only if the ancestor is not on vacation themselves.

So, first, let's model the data.

For each employee, we need:

- The current number of subordinates on vacation (call this cnt[i]).
- Whether the employee themselves is on vacation (vacation[i]).

When a vacation event happens (add or remove), we need to update the cnt for all ancestors of that employee, either increasing or decreasing by 1.

Then, for each ancestor v in the path from the employee up to the root (employee 1), we check:

If vacation[v] is false, and cnt[v] > t[v], then this ancestor contributes to the displeased count. But how do we track this efficiently?

The problem is that after each update, we need to determine how many employees are in the state where they are not on vacation and their cnt exceeds their t.

So, the main challenge is to track for all employees, whether they are currently in the 'displeased' state (vacation is false and cnt > t). Then, when any of their cnt changes, we need to update their state and keep a global count of how many are displeased.

But maintaining this count for each possible change is tricky. Because when we increment or decrement the cnt of an employee, we need to check if that employee's state (displeased or not) has changed. But since the cnt is being updated for all ancestors of the modified employee, we have to check each of their states each time.

Wait, but the process of adding a vacation to employee x would increment the cnt of all ancestors. So for each ancestor v in the path from x to root:

1. Increment cnt[v] by 1.
2. Check if v is not on vacation, and if cnt[v] after the increment now exceeds t[v]. If so, if it wasn't in the displeased count before, add it. If the state changed from not-displeased to displeased, increase the total.

Similarly, when removing a vacation (employee returns), decrement cnt[v] by 1 for each ancestor, check if the state changes from displeased to not.

But again, this would require O(depth) operations per query. Which for 1e5 queries and depth up to 1e5 (in a chain), this is 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each employee, precompute all their ancestors (but that's O(n^2) in worst case, which isn't feasible). So that's not useful.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that when an employee is on vacation, their own state (whether they are displeased) is irrelevant, because if they are on vacation, they can't be displeased. So, the displeased count is the number of employees not on vacation and whose cnt exceeds t.

So, for each employee, their displeased state depends on two variables: their vacation status and their cnt.

So, for each employee, we can track:

- vacation[i]: bool
- cnt[i]: the number of their subordinates on vacation.

The displeased count is the sum over all employees i of (not vacation[i] and cnt[i] > t[i]).

But how do we compute this sum efficiently?

Each query affects a certain employee's vacation status (toggle it), and then for all their ancestors, their cnt is incremented or decremented by 1. Then, for each of these ancestors, we need to check if their state (displeased or not) has changed.

So for each query, the steps are:

1. Toggle the vacation status of the employee x (q is +x or -x). For example, if the query is +x, then x was not on vacation, and now is. So, vacation[x] becomes True, and we need to subtract x from the displeased count if it was counted before. But wait, when x is on vacation, he can't be displeased. But when x is on vacation, his own cnt (number of his subordinates on vacation) doesn't affect his state. However, his ancestors' cnt may change because x is now on vacation.

Wait, no. Because the cnt[i] for an employee i is the count of subordinates (direct and indirect) that are on vacation. So when x is added to the vacation list, all of his ancestors' cnt increases by 1. So when processing a query, we need to:

For example, when x starts a vacation:

- For each ancestor v of x (including x's parent up to root), increment cnt[v] by 1.

But x's own cnt is the number of his subordinates on vacation. So x's own cnt isn't affected by x's vacation. Because x is a subordinate of his manager, but his own cnt counts his subordinates. So, when x goes on vacation, his manager's cnt increases by 1 (since x is a subordinate), but x's cnt is the count of x's subordinates, which could include others.

Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.

Let me clarify:

Each employee's cnt[i] is the number of subordinates (direct and indirect) that are on vacation. So, for example, if x is a manager with subordinate y, and y is on vacation, then x's cnt increases by 1. If x himself goes on vacation, then his own cnt (number of his subordinates on vacation) is separate. But x's manager's cnt would include x if x is on vacation, but x's cnt is only about his subordinates.

Wait, no. Because the definition says that a subordinate is any employee in the subtree of the manager. So, for employee v, all employees in their subtree (excluding v) are subordinates. So, when any of those subordinates are on vacation, they contribute to v's cnt.

So, if x is on vacation, then x's manager's cnt increases by 1 (because x is a subordinate of the manager). But x's own cnt is the count of x's subordinates who are on vacation. So x's own cnt is not affected by his own vacation status.

So, when an employee x is added to the vacation (query is +x), we need to:

- For each ancestor of x (including x's parent, grandparent, etc. up to root), their cnt increases by 1.

Because x is a subordinate of all these ancestors, and x is now on vacation.

Similarly, when x is removed from vacation (query is -x), all ancestors' cnt decreases by 1.

So, the process of handling a query is:

1. Check if the query is to add or remove x.

2. For adding x: check if x was not already on vacation. Then, for each ancestor of x (up to root), increment their cnt by 1. Then, set x's vacation status to True.

3. For removing x: check if x was on vacation. Then, for each ancestor of x, decrement their cnt by 1. Then, set x's vacation status to False.

But how to track the ancestors efficiently?

Each employee's parent is given. So, to get the list of ancestors for x, we can walk up the parent pointers until we reach the root.

So, for x, the list of ancestors is x's parent, parent of parent, etc., up to root.

The problem is that for each query, this could be O(k) steps, where k is the depth of x in the tree. For a tree that's a chain, this is O(n) per query. Which is O(mn) time overall. Which is too slow for m=1e5 and n=1e5.

So, we need a way to compute these updates in O(1) or O(log n) time per query.

Hmm. So, the crux of the problem is efficiently updating the cnt for all ancestors of x, and then checking for each of those ancestors whether their state (displeased or not) has changed, and updating the total count accordingly.

Alternative idea: For each query, when x's vacation status changes, we need to add or subtract 1 from the cnt of all ancestors of x. Then, for each ancestor v in that path, we need to check whether the change in cnt affects their displeased state.

But how do we do this efficiently?

Wait, perhaps we can model this with a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or a segment tree. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, we can precompute for each node x, all the nodes in its ancestor path, and represent that in a way that allows us to update all of them quickly. But I don't think that's straightforward.

Another approach: For each node, keep track of the current cnt, which is the number of subordinates on vacation.

But how to represent this? Since each time a node's subordinate (including descendants) goes on vacation, the cnt of all their ancestors increases by 1. So, for example, if x is added to the vacation, then all ancestors up to root have their cnt increased by 1.

Wait, but this is equivalent to adding 1 along the path from x's parent to root. Because x is a subordinate of all of his ancestors. So, when x is on vacation, each of his ancestors' cnt increases by 1. So, for each x, the path from x's parent to root is the path of nodes whose cnt increases when x is added.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.

The cnt for a node v is the number of subordinates (i.e., descendants in the tree) that are on vacation. So, when x is added to the vacation, all of his ancestors (including his parent, grandparent, etc.) will have their cnt increased by 1. Because x is a subordinate of each of these ancestors.

So, the path of ancestors starts from x's parent? Or from x's direct parent up to root?

Wait, no. Let's say x's parent is p, p's parent is q, and so on up to root. Then x is a subordinate of p, q, etc. So, when x is on vacation, p's cnt increases by 1 (since x is a subordinate of p), q's cnt increases by 1 (since x is a subordinate of q), etc.

So, when x is added to the vacation, all ancestors in the chain from x's parent up to the root have their cnt incremented by 1.

Wait, but x's parent is p. So x is a child of p. So, p's cnt is the number of subordinates (direct and indirect) of p that are on vacation. So x is a direct subordinate of p, so adding x to the vacation increases p's cnt by 1. Then, p's parent's cnt increases by 1 because p is a subordinate of their parent, and x is a subordinate of their parent (through p). So, when x is on vacation, all of x's ancestors (including p, p's parent, etc.) have their cnt increased by 1. So, the path to update includes all ancestors of x (including x's parent, but not x himself, since x's cnt is his subordinates).

So, for each x, when x is added to the vacation, we need to update all ancestors (parent, parent's parent, etc.) up to root by adding 1 to their cnt. Then, for each of these ancestors, check if their state (displeased) has changed.

But doing this for each ancestor is O(k) per query, which is too slow.

So, how can we find a way to represent these updates more efficiently?

An idea comes to mind: Each employee's cnt is the number of their descendants (subordinates) currently on vacation. So, the cnt[v] for a node v is the sum over all descendants of v (excluding v) that are on vacation. So, if we can represent this sum efficiently, perhaps using a tree structure where each node can be updated, and the sum of a subtree can be queried.

Wait, but the cnt[v] is the count of nodes in the subtree of v (excluding v) that are on vacation. So, if we can model this with a data structure that allows us to add 1 or subtract 1 to all ancestors of a node when a node's vacation status changes, and query the cnt for each node.

But how?

Ah! This is exactly the case where a Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD) might be useful, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, we can use an Euler Tour to represent the tree in a flat array and then use a BIT or Fenwick tree to perform range updates and point queries.

Wait, let's think: The cnt[v] is the number of nodes in the subtree of v (excluding v) that are on vacation. Because a subordinate of v is any node in the subtree of v except v himself. So, for each node x in the subtree of v (excluding v), if x is on vacation, it contributes to cnt[v].

So, when x is added to the vacation, all ancestors of x (excluding x) have their cnt increased by 1. Wait, no. Because the ancestors of x include all nodes from x's parent up to root. Each of these nodes has x in their subtree, so their cnt increases by 1.

So, when x is added to the vacation, the cnt of all ancestors of x (including parent, grandparent, etc.) increases by 1. So, for each such ancestor v, cnt[v] += 1. Similarly, when x is removed from vacation, cnt[v] -=1.

So, for each query (add or remove x), the required operation is to add delta (1 or -1) to all ancestors of x. Then, for each ancestor v in the path, check if their state (displeased) has changed.

But how to perform these updates efficiently.

Wait, the problem is that each query requires updating all ancestors of x. For each x, the number of ancestors is O(depth), which can be O(n) in the worst case. So for m=1e5, this becomes O(nm) time.

This is not feasible. So we need a way to represent these updates in O(1) or O(log n) time per query.

Alternative idea: Use a Fenwick tree or a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) that can perform range updates and point queries. But how to model the tree structure.

Wait, the key insight is that each time a node x is added or removed from vacation, we need to add 1 or subtract 1 to all nodes along the path from x's parent up to the root.

So, each node's parent defines a path to the root. So, each node's parent's path is unique. So, for example, if x has parent p, p has parent q, etc., then the path from x's parent to root is p, q, ..., root.

So, when we need to add 1 to all ancestors of x (i.e., to p, q, etc.), this is equivalent to adding 1 to each node in this path.

But how can we represent these paths in a way that allows us to perform range updates efficiently?

This seems like a job for a link-cut tree, but that's quite complex. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an Euler Tour Technique (ETT) where each node is represented in a linear array, and the ancestors of x form a path in the array.

But I'm not sure. Let's think differently.

Each node's ancestors form a path from itself to the root. So, for node x, the path is x's parent, x's grandparent, etc., up to the root.

Each time x is added to the vacation, we need to add 1 to all nodes in this path (excluding x itself, but including the parent). Similarly for removal.

So, the problem reduces to, for a tree, when given a node x, perform a range update (add delta) on all nodes along the path from x's parent to root, and then for each of those nodes, check if their displeased state has changed.

But how to perform the range update efficiently.

One possible way is to use a heavy-light decomposition (HLD) to split the tree into chains. Each path from a node to the root can be broken into O(log n) chains. Then, for each chain, we can represent it with a segment tree or BIT that allows range updates. This way, adding delta to all nodes in the path from x's parent to the root can be done in O(log n) time.

But this requires building HLD for the tree, which is possible. Let's think about this approach.

So steps:

1. Precompute HLD for the tree. Each node's path to root is split into O(log n) chains.

2. For each chain, have a BIT or a segment tree that can perform range updates (add delta to all nodes in the chain) and point queries (get the current cnt for a node).

3. When a query comes (add or remove x), compute delta (1 or -1) and perform a range update on all chains along the path from x's parent to root.

But how to model the path from x's parent to root in terms of chains.

In HLD, each time you move from a node to its parent, you traverse the chains. So, for the path from p (x's parent) to root, HLD will split it into O(log n) chains, and for each chain, you can perform a range add.

Each chain is a contiguous segment in the array used by HLD. So, for each chain in the path, you can perform a range add on the entire chain. This would take O(log n) operations per query.

But wait, the path from p to root is a sequence of chains. For each chain in that path, the entire chain is part of the path, so we can perform a range add on the entire chain.

So, for each query, the number of range add operations is O(log n), each taking O(log n) time (if using a BIT per chain). But building HLD with multiple BITs can be complex, especially since the number of chains can vary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a single BIT with a clever way to represent the ranges.

Alternatively, represent each node's position in the HLD's flattened array, and for each chain, track the start and end indices in the array. Then, for each chain in the path, we can perform a range add on the start and end indices of that chain.

But I'm not sure. Let's proceed with this approach.

Once we can compute the cnt for each node in O(1) or O(log n) time, then the next step is to track the displeased count.

For each node v, the displeased state is (not vacation[v]) and (cnt[v] > t[v]). So, whenever the cnt[v] changes or vacation[v] changes, we need to check if v's state has changed.

But how to track this.

But in the problem, the vacation[v] is only changed when v is the one being added or removed. For example, when the query is +x, x's vacation status becomes True. So, in that case, we need to check if x's own state (displeased) has changed. Because before, x was not on vacation, and his cnt could have been above t[x]. But after x is on vacation, he cannot be displeased, so if he was in the displeased count before, he needs to be subtracted.

But in the case where the query is +x, the main steps are:

- Toggle x's vacation status to True.
- For all ancestors of x (parent, grandparent, etc.), increment their cnt by 1.

But x's own cnt is the number of subordinates on vacation. So, when x is on vacation, his manager's cnt increases by 1. But x's own cnt is not affected by his own vacation status.

So, when x is added to vacation:

1. For all ancestors v (parent, etc.), their cnt increases by 1. So, for each such v, check if (vacation[v] is False) and (cnt[v] after increment > t[v]). If so, their state may change (from not displeased to displeased or vice versa).

But how to track this for all those v in O(1) time.

Wait, perhaps we can precompute for each node v, the threshold t[v]. Then, whenever the cnt[v] is updated, we can check if the current cnt[v] exceeds t[v], and whether the node is not on vacation. If so, it contributes to the displeased count.

But how to track this for all nodes, especially those whose cnt is updated in each query.

But with HLD and BIT for cnt updates, each query's update is O(log n) time. Then, for each node v whose cnt is updated (all ancestors of x's parent), after the update, we need to check if their state (displeased) has changed, and update the total accordingly.

But this would require O(log n) operations per query, each of which could take O(1) time if we can compute their current cnt and t, and track their vacation status and previous state.

But how to track the previous state for each node.

Alternatively, for each node v, we can track:

- current cnt (using HLD and BIT)
- vacation status (a boolean array)
- whether the current state is displeased (a boolean array)

But then, after updating cnt for v (via the HLD), we can check the new cnt and vacation status to determine if the state has changed.

But the problem is that for each query, after we update the cnt of O(log n) nodes (using HLD), we need to check each of them. Wait, no. Because when using HLD to perform a range update, we are adding delta to a range of nodes (all ancestors in a chain). So, each of those nodes' cnt is increased by delta. Then, for each such node, we need to check if their state has changed.

But this would require checking all nodes in the path. Which is O(depth) per query, which is not acceptable.

So, this approach doesn't solve the time complexity problem.

Alternative idea: For each node v, maintain the value of (cnt[v] - t[v]). Then, the node is displeased if (vacation[v] is false) and (cnt[v] - t[v] > 0). So, the current value is (cnt[v] - t[v]) if not on vacation, else 0.

But how to track this efficiently.

But the main problem is that for each query, after updating the cnt of all ancestors of x, we need to check each of those ancestors to see if their state (displeased) has changed.

So, perhaps the key is to find a way to represent, for each node, whether it is displeased, and when their cnt is updated, how that affects their state.

But even with this, for each query, we need to process O(k) nodes, which is O(n) time in the worst case.

Hmm. This is a tough problem. Let's think of alternative approaches.

Wait, perhaps for each node, the only time its state changes (displeased or not) is when its cnt changes. Because the vacation status of a node is only changed when the node itself is added or removed. So, when a node's vacation status changes, its own state may change, but for all other nodes, their state can only change if their cnt changes.

So, when processing a query for x (adding or removing), there are two parts:

1. The change in x's vacation status. This affects x's own state (displeased or not), and also affects the cnt of all of x's ancestors.

2. The change in cnt of all ancestors of x. For each such ancestor v, their cnt increases or decreases by 1, which may change their state.

So, the total number of nodes that need to be checked for state changes is O(1 + k), where k is the number of ancestors of x. But in the worst case, this is O(n), which is too slow.

Thus, the problem is to find a way to track these state changes efficiently.

Another idea: Since the displeased count is the sum over all v of (vacation[v] is false and cnt[v] > t[v]), can we precompute for each node v, the value (cnt[v] - t[v]), and whenever this value crosses zero (from below to above or above to below), we add or subtract 1 from the total count.

But how to track this.

For each node v, track whether (cnt[v] > t[v]). If vacation[v] is false, then v contributes to the total. So, the total is sum over v of (not vacation[v] and (cnt[v] > t[v])).

So, each time cnt[v] changes, we need to check if the (cnt[v] > t[v]) status changes, and whether vacation[v] is false. If so, the total is adjusted accordingly.

So, for each query, the steps are:

For the event (add or remove x):

1. For the node x:

   a. Toggle vacation[x]. If adding, vacation[x] becomes True. If removing, becomes False.

   b. Check if x's own state has changed. For example, before adding, if x was not on vacation and cnt[x] > t[x], then x was in the total. After adding, x is on vacation, so no longer in the total. So, subtract 1 if the previous state was contributing.

   Similarly for removing x: if after removal, x is not on vacation, and cnt[x] > t[x], then add 1.

2. For all ancestors v of x (parent, etc.):

   a. For each v, their cnt changes by delta (1 or -1).

   b. For each v, check if their (cnt[v] > t[v]) status has changed. Also, check if vacation[v] is False. If so, adjust the total accordingly.

But again, for each query, this involves O(k) steps, which is not acceptable.

Hmm. So perhaps the key is to model the problem in such a way that each query can be handled in O(1) or O(log n) time, regardless of the depth of the node.

But how?

Alternative approach: Precompute for each node v, the value (t[v] + 1). Then, the current cnt[v] can be tracked. Whenever cnt[v] exceeds t[v], and vacation[v] is False, then v contributes to the total.

But how to track this.

Another idea: For each node v, maintain a value overflow[v] = max(0, cnt[v] - t[v]). Then, the node is displeased if overflow[v] > 0 and not on vacation. So, the total is sum of (overflow[v] > 0) * (1 - vacation[v]).

But how to compute overflow[v] efficiently. Because each query affects the cnt[v] of all ancestors of x, which can be O(n) in the worst case.

But this doesn't resolve the time complexity.

Alternative idea: Realize that when we add or remove x from vacation, we're toggling their vacation status and changing the cnt of all ancestors. Then, for each of these ancestors, their overflow (cnt[v] - t[v]) changes by ±1. So, for each such v, if vacation[v] is False, then the overflow[v] could cross zero, thus changing the total.

But how to track this without checking each node.

Wait, perhaps for each node v, we can precompute whether adding or subtracting 1 to cnt[v] would change whether (cnt[v] - t[v] >= 0) when vacation[v] is False.

For example:

Original overflow = cnt[v] - t[v]

If delta is +1:

new_overflow = original_overflow + 1

If original_overflow <= 0 and new_overflow > 0 and vacation[v] is False: add 1 to total.

If original_overflow >0 and new_overflow <=0 and vacation[v] is False: subtract 1.

Similarly for delta -1.

So, for each node v in the path of ancestors, during a query that changes their cnt by delta, we can compute how the overflow changes and update the total accordingly.

But again, this requires processing each node in the path, which is O(k) per query.

Thus, this approach doesn't help with time.

So, perhaps the problem requires a solution that uses O(1) time per query, but I can't see it. Perhaps there's a clever observation.

Wait, think about the fact that when a node is added to the vacation, all of its ancestors' cnt increases by 1. So, for each ancestor v, if their vacation[v] is False, then their overflow increases by 1. This can push them into or out of the displeased state.

But for each such v, the initial overflow is cnt[v] - t[v], and after adding 1, it's (cnt[v] + 1) - t[v]. So, the delta for overflow is +1.

So, for each v:

Before the update, if (cnt[v] - t[v]) <= 0 and vacation[v] is False: they were not in the total. After adding 1, if (cnt[v] + 1) - t[v] >0, then they are added to the total.

Similarly, if they were already in the total, adding 1 may keep them there.

So, the total changes by the number of ancestors v where:

- vacation[v] is False

- (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) before the update. Because adding 1 would push it to 1, which is >0.

Or:

- (cnt[v] - t[v] >0) before: no change.

Or:

- (cnt[v] - t[v] <0) before: adding 1 may not cross zero.

Wait, perhaps the only way adding 1 to cnt[v] can change the total for v is if after the increment, cnt[v] - t[v] is now >0, and before it was <=0.

So, the delta for the total is +1 if:

vacation[v] is False, and (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0).

Similarly, for decrementing, the delta would be -1 if:

vacation[v] is False, and (cnt[v] - t[v] == 1).

Because after decrementing, it becomes 0, so no longer in the total.

But how can we count the number of ancestors v in the path that satisfy these conditions, without iterating through all of them.

This seems impossible unless there's a way to precompute for each possible ancestor v, these conditions.

But perhaps there's a way to model this with some data structure.

Another Idea: For each node v, maintain two values:

- The current cnt[v] (number of subordinates on vacation).

- A flag indicating whether vacation[v] is True or False.

Additionally, for each node v, maintain:

- A value that indicates whether v is in the displeased state (i.e., not vacation and cnt > t).

The total is the sum of all these flags.

But how to update these flags efficiently.

The problem is that when cnt[v] changes, the flag may change. So, whenever cnt[v] is updated, we need to check whether the flag for v should change.

But when a query is processed, the cnt of O(k) nodes is updated. For each of them, we need to check if their flag changed and update the total accordingly.

This is O(k) per query, which is too slow.

But perhaps we can find a way to compute the number of nodes in the path that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., cnt[v] == t[v] and not on vacation) using some kind of data structure that can answer this in O(1) or O(log n) time.

But how?

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each node v the values of t[v], and track how many of its ancestors in the path have certain properties. For example, during a query, when adding delta=1 to all ancestors of x's parent, we can compute how many of those ancestors have cnt[v] == t[v] - delta, and are not on vacation. This would give the delta to add to the total.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each node v, track the current value of (cnt[v] - t[v]) and whether vacation[v] is False. Then, when delta is applied to cnt[v], the change in the total is:

If vacation[v] is False:

- If (cnt[v] - t[v]) <= 0 and (cnt[v] - t[v] + delta) > 0: total +=1.

- If (cnt[v] - t[v]) > 0 and (cnt[v] - t[v] + delta) <=0: total -=1.

So, for each v in the path, the delta to the total is:

delta_total = 0

if not vacation[v]:

    old = cnt[v] - t[v]

    new = old + delta

    if old <=0 and new >0:

        delta_total +=1

    elif old >0 and new <=0:

        delta_total -=1

So, the total is adjusted by delta_total.

But this requires checking each v in the path, which is O(k) per query.

So, this brings us back to the same problem.

Thus, unless there's a way to represent this delta_total for the entire path in O(1) time per query, the problem remains unsolved.

But I can't see how to do that.

Alternative Idea: Realize that when a node is added or removed from vacation, the path of ancestors is the same as the path from x's parent to root. So, for each node x, the path is a unique path. If we can precompute for each node x the number of ancestors v where (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) and vacation[v] is False, then adding 1 to cnt[v] for all such v would increase the total by that count. Similarly for other cases.

But this requires maintaining for each node x, some kind of count along the path, which is dynamic and changes with each query.

Alternatively, for each node v, maintain a count of how many times (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) and vacation[v] is False. Then, when a query adds delta=1 to all ancestors, the total delta is the sum over these ancestors of the delta for each. But again, this requires per-node tracking and summing.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, but perhaps in practice, the test cases do not have very deep trees. But the problem constraints allow for up to n=1e5, so the worst case would be a chain, which makes the approach O(mn) time.

Which is 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.

So, we need a smarter approach.

Alternative Idea: For each node, track the current number of subordinates on vacation (cnt), and t. The displeased count is sum over v (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] > t[v]). 

But when we add or remove x from vacation, the cnt of all ancestors is changed by ±1. So, for each ancestor v, the term (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] > t[v]) can change.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Perhaps for each node, we can precompute the number of ancestors where (cnt[v] > t[v] and not vacation[v]).

But this is dynamic and changes with each query.

Another Idea: The only way a node can become displeased is if its cnt increases past t[v], and it's not on vacation. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into maintaining for each node the current cnt, and for each query, the answer is the number of nodes where (cnt[v] > t[v] and not vacation[v]).

But how to maintain this count efficiently.

This is exactly the problem. We need to compute this sum after each query. But with each query potentially changing O(k) nodes' cnt, this is the crux.

But perhaps there's a way to model this with a binary indexed tree or segment tree that tracks the number of nodes in certain states.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose we can represent for each node v a binary value: 1 if (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] > t[v]), else 0. The total is the sum of all such values.

Each query toggles the vacation status of x and updates cnt of all ancestors. Then, for each of these ancestors, we need to update their binary value and adjust the total.

But again, this requires processing each ancestor.

But perhaps we can model the updates to cnt[v] as events and track the binary values with some data structure.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Idea: When adding x to vacation, the delta for the total is:

For x:

- If x is now on vacation, subtract 1 if x was previously in the total (not on vacation and cnt[x] > t[x]).

For each ancestor v of x:

- The cnt[v] increases by 1. So, if v is not on vacation, check if the previous cnt[v] was exactly t[v]. If so, then this increment makes it t[v] + 1, so add 1 to the total. If the previous cnt[v] was t[v] + 1, then increment makes it t[v] + 2, so no change. If previous was below t[v], then check if new is above.

So, for each ancestor v:

delta_total += 1 if (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == t[v]) else 0.

Similarly for removal:

delta_total -= 1 if (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == t[v] + 1) else 0.

So, the total delta is:

delta = (x's own delta) + sum over ancestors v (delta for v).

So, the question is, can we compute the sum over ancestors v of (delta for v) efficiently.

If for each query, we can find the number of ancestors v of x that satisfy (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == t[v]) when adding, or (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == t[v] + 1) when removing.

But how to compute this sum quickly.

For example, when adding x, for each ancestor v:

if (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == t[v]) before the increment, then increment delta_total by 1.

Similarly for the other case.

So, the sum is the number of ancestors v that meet these conditions.

If we can track for each node v, the number of times (not vacation[v] and cnt[v] == k) for various k, then perhaps we can answer this.

But this seems challenging.

Another Idea: Use a hash map or dictionary for each node to track the current cnt[v] and vacation status. But this doesn't help with the path queries.

Alternatively, precompute for each node v, the current value of (cnt[v] - t[v]). Then, during a query, the delta for each ancestor v is whether (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) and not vacation[v] (for adding), or (cnt[v] - t[v] == 1) and not vacation[v] (for removing).

But again, how to count the number of such v in the path.

This brings us back to the original problem.

Perhaps the only way to proceed is to find that this problem requires O(k) time per query, but in practice, the average depth is small. But for the worst case, this would not be feasible.

But given the constraints (n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5), the solution must be O(m log n) time.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the cnt[v] for each node using a binary indexed tree that can handle path updates and point queries, combined with a way to track the current state of each node.

But how.

Wait, here's a different approach inspired by the fact that each query affects the path from x's parent to root.

Each node's cnt is the number of subordinates on vacation. So, for x, when added to vacation, all ancestors' cnt increases by 1.

This can be modeled with a Fenwick tree that supports adding 1 to all nodes in the path from x's parent to root. Then, each cnt[v] is the sum of the Fenwick tree's values at v's position.

But how to model the path from x's parent to root as a range in the Fenwick tree.

This is where HLD comes into play. HLD allows us to break the path from any node to the root into O(log n) chains, each represented as a contiguous interval. For each chain, we can perform a range update (add 1) in O(log n) time.

So, the steps are:

1. Build the HLD of the tree. For each node, determine the chains and their positions in the array.

2. For each query, determine whether we are adding or removing x.

3. If adding x:

   a. Set vacation[x] to True.

   b. For each ancestor v in x's parent to root path, increment cnt[v] by 1. This is done by performing range add 1 on each chain in the HLD path.

   c. For x's own state: if x was not on vacation before, and after adding, check if x's state was contributing to the total. Adjust the total accordingly.

4. For each ancestor v in the path:

   a. Before updating their cnt, check if (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]). If so, incrementing their cnt would add 1 to the total.

   b. After updating, check if (cnt[v] + 1 == t[v] + 1 and not vacation[v]). This part is tricky.

But again, this requires checking each ancestor in the path.

So, even with HLD for efficient range updates, we still need to process O(log n) chains, each with O(1) time, but for each node in the path, we need to check their state change.

But with HLD, each chain in the path is a contiguous segment, and we can iterate over each segment and process all nodes in them.

But this approach would still require O(log n) time per query, but for each chain, we have to find the number of nodes that meet a certain condition (e.g., cnt[v] == t[v] before the increment and not vacation[v]). This is challenging.

Another Idea: Precompute for each node v, the value (cnt[v] - t[v]). Then, the delta for the total when incrementing cnt[v] by 1 is:

If (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) and not vacation[v]: delta += 1.

So, for each query, the total delta is the number of nodes in the path that have (cnt[v] - t[v] == 0) and not vacation[v].

But how to count this number efficiently.

If we can maintain for each node v a value (cnt[v] - t[v]), and then for each query, count the number of nodes in the path where this value is 0 and vacation[v] is False.

This sounds like a problem that can be addressed with a data structure that can answer range queries for the count of nodes that meet certain conditions. But with dynamic data, it's challenging.

So, perhaps using a segment tree with each node storing a frequency map of the values (cnt[v] - t[v]) for the nodes in its range. But this would be very slow and memory-intensive for large n.

Alternative Idea: For each node v, maintain the value (cnt[v] - t[v]). For each query, after applying the range add to the path, we can iterate through each node in the path and check whether their value is now 0 and vacation is False. But again, this is O(k) time per query.

Thus, the problem seems stuck.

Perhaps the solution is to realize that the only way to track this efficiently is to use a data structure that allows range additions and can query the number of elements equal to a certain value in a range. However, I'm not aware of any such data structure that can do this efficiently.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to process each query in O(k) time, and rely on the fact that in practice, the tree is not a chain, and the average depth is small. But for the given constraints, this would not pass the time limit for a worst-case scenario.

But wait, let's look at the sample input.

In the first sample:

7 employees. The tree is structured as:

1 is the root.

Children of 1: 4, 5.

Children of 4: 2.

Children of 5: 6,7.

Children of 2: 3.

So, the depth for node 3 is 3 (3's parent is 2, which is parent 4, which is parent 1).

So, the depth is manageable, but in a chain of 1e5 nodes, this approach would be O(m * 1e5) time, which is 1e10 operations, which is way over.

Thus, this suggests that the intended solution must have a different approach.

Alternative Idea: For each employee, when they are added or removed from vacation, the only ancestors that can possibly contribute to the displeased count are those where their cnt is exactly t[v] (for adding) or t[v]+1 (for removing). So, perhaps we can track for each node v, how many times their cnt is at these critical values.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, when adding x, for each ancestor v, their cnt increases by 1. The delta to the total is the number of ancestors v where:

- vacation[v] is False.

- (cnt[v] before increment) == t[v].

Because after incrementing, cnt[v] becomes t[v] + 1, so if vacation[v] is False, this would add 1 to the total.

Similarly, when removing x (delta=-1), the delta is the number of ancestors v where:

- vacation[v] is False.

- (cnt[v] before increment) == t[v] +1.

Because after decrementing, cnt[v] becomes t[v], so if vacation[v] is False, this would subtract 1 from the total.

So, the delta for the total is the number of ancestors v that meet these conditions.

If we can track these counts efficiently, then each query can be processed in O(1) time.

But how to track the number of ancestors v that have cnt[v] == t[v] (for adding) or cnt[v] == t[v] +1 (for removing).

This seems impossible unless we can precompute for each node v these values and track them dynamically.

But given that the cnt[v] changes dynamically, this is challenging.

Another Idea: For each node v, maintain a set of possible values of (cnt[v] - t[v]). Then, for a query, we can find how many ancestors have (cnt[v] - t[v] == -1) for adding, or (cnt[v] - t[v] == 1) for removing.

But again, maintaining such a structure is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, precompute for each node v, the value t[v] and track the current cnt[v]. Then, for each query, when adding x, the number of ancestors v where cnt[v] == t[v] and not on vacation is the delta for adding.

But how to compute this quickly.

This is the crux of the problem.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me think about the problem from another angle.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when an employee is on vacation, their own subordinates' vacation status doesn't affect their manager's cnt. Because the employee is on vacation, their manager's cnt increases by 1, but the employee's own cnt is the number of their subordinates on vacation. So, when the employee is on vacation, their subordinates' changes do not affect the manager's cnt, but the employee's own presence affects the manager's cnt.

But this doesn't directly help.

Another Idea: For each node, the current cnt is the number of subordinates (direct and indirect) on vacation. So, if we can represent this as a sum over all descendants (excluding the node itself) of their vacation status.

So, the cnt for a node v is equal to the sum of vacation status of all subordinates of v.

Thus, when x is added to vacation, this adds 1 to the cnt of all ancestors of x.

But this is the same as before.

So, the problem is to compute the sum over all nodes v of (not vacation[v] and (sum_{u is subordinate of v} vacation[u] ) > t[v]).

This is equivalent to the original problem statement.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

This seems like a problem that can be handled by a data structure that can perform the following operations:

1. Toggle the vacation status of a node x (add or remove).

2. For all ancestors of x (parent, etc.), update their cnt by ±1.

3. For each such ancestor v, check if their (cnt[v] > t[v]) and (not vacation[v]), and update the total.

But again, this requires O(k) steps per query.

Thus, perhaps there's no way around this, and the problem requires a solution with O(k) steps per query, but using optimizations like precomputing the ancestor paths and using a binary indexed tree for the cnt updates.

But how.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the fact that the sum over all ancestors' cnt changes can be computed using a path query:

Each time a node x is added to vacation, we need to add 1 to the cnt of all ancestors of x. So, the total increase in the displeased count is the number of ancestors v where:

- (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]) → after increment, cnt[v] becomes t[v] + 1, so adds 1.

Similarly, for removal.

So, the delta for the query is the number of such nodes.

Thus, if we can compute for each query the number of ancestors v that satisfy (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]) (for adding) or (cnt[v] == t[v] +1 and not vacation[v]) (for removing), then we can compute the delta.

But how to track this.

For each node v, we can maintain a count of whether (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]) → this is a binary value. Then, the sum of these values over the path from x's parent to root gives the delta for adding.

Similarly, the sum of (cnt[v] == t[v] +1 and not vacation[v]) gives the delta for removing.

Thus, for each query, the delta is:

if adding x:

delta = sum_{v in path} (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v])

else:

delta = sum_{v in path} (cnt[v] == t[v]+1 and not vacation[v])

Then, the total is adjusted by delta, plus the change in x's own state.

So, the problem reduces to performing these path sums efficiently.

But how.

If we can model each node v with a binary value (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]), then for each query of adding x, the delta is the sum of these values along the path from x's parent to root.

Similarly for the other case.

But how to compute this sum quickly.

This is again a path query, which can be addressed with HLD. For each such condition, build a segment tree that allows path queries.

But each query would require O(log n) time per chain.

Thus, the steps would be:

1. Preprocess the tree into HLD chains.

2. For each node v, maintain two binary values:

   a. a[v] = 1 if (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]), else 0.

   b. b[v] = 1 if (cnt[v] == t[v]+1 and not vacation[v]), else 0.

3. For each chain in the HLD, build a segment tree that can compute the sum of a[v] or b[v] over a range.

4. When processing a query:

   a. If adding x:

      i. The delta is the sum of a[v] over the path from x's parent to root.

      ii. After updating the cnt of all ancestors, update a[v] and b[v] for each ancestor v.

   b. If removing x:

      i. The delta is the sum of b[v] over the path from x's parent to root.

      ii. After updating the cnt of all ancestors, update a[v] and b[v] for each ancestor v.

But this requires efficiently updating the a and b values for each ancestor and querying the sum along the path.

But this seems feasible.

The detailed steps:

Building the HLD:

- Preprocess the tree into chains, each represented as a segment in the HLD array.

For each query:

Adding x:

1. Toggle x's vacation status to True. If x was not on vacation before:

   a. Check if x's own a and b values need to be updated. Since x is now on vacation, a[x] and b[x] are set to 0.

   b. Compute the previous contribution of x (if not on vacation and cnt[x] > t[x]) and subtract it from the total.

2. For all ancestors v of x's parent:

   a. Increment their cnt by 1.

   b. For each v, update a[v] and b[v] based on their new cnt.

   c. The delta for the total is the sum of a[v] (before the increment) over the path.

But wait, because when we increment cnt[v], the a[v] and b[v] values may change. So, the sum should be computed before the increment.

Ah, right. The delta is the number of ancestors v where (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]) before the increment. So, the sum is computed before the increment.

But this complicates things. Because for the query of adding x, the delta is the sum of a[v] for ancestors v before their cnt is increased.

Thus, the steps for adding x would be:

- For each ancestor v in the path from x's parent to root:

   i. Check if a[v] is 1 (i.e., cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]). Add this to delta.

   ii. Increment cnt[v] by 1.

   iii. Update a[v] and b[v] based on the new cnt.

But again, this is O(k) steps.

So, the only way to compute the sum of a[v] along the path quickly is to use HLD with segment trees that can answer the sum over the path.

But how to handle the updates.

This approach would require maintaining segment trees for the a and b values, which are updated dynamically.

But for each query, we would need to:

- For the path from x's parent to root:

   a. Query the sum of a[v] (for adding) or b[v] (for removing).

   b. Perform range updates to increment or decrement cnt[v] for all nodes in the path.

   c. Update a[v] and b[v] for each node in the path.

But this would require O(log n) time per query for the path sum and the range updates, plus O(1) time for the a and b updates.

But how to handle the a and b updates when the cnt changes.

Each time the cnt of a node v is updated, the a[v] and b[v] values may change. For example, if after incrementing cnt[v], it equals t[v], then a[v] is 1 if not vacation[v]. Otherwise, it's 0.

So, for each node v in the path, after changing cnt[v], we need to recompute a[v] and b[v].

But this again requires O(k) steps per query.

Thus, this approach doesn't solve the time complexity issue.

At this point, I'm not sure what the correct approach is. Maybe there's a different way to model the problem.

Let's try to think of the problem from the perspective of the sample input.

In the first sample:

After employee 2 leaves for a vacation:

- His parent is 4, which's cnt increases by 1. 4's t is 1. So cnt[4] becomes 1, which is not more than t. But the head manager (1) has cnt increases by 1 (now 2), and his t is 0. So he becomes displeased.

So, for this case, the delta is 1 because the head manager's cnt was 1 before the increment (after increment, it's 2). Wait, no. Wait, when x=2 is added to vacation, all ancestors (4, 1) have their cnt increased by 1.

For v=4:

Before increment, cnt is 0. t[4] is 1. So after increment, 0+1=1, which is not > t[4], so no change.

For v=1:

Before increment, cnt is 0. t[1] is 0. So after increment, cnt is 1. So 1 > 0 → becomes displeased. So delta += 1.

Thus, the total increases by 1.

So, the delta for adding x=2 is 1.

This corresponds to the number of ancestors where (cnt[v] == t[v] and not vacation[v]) before the increment.

In this case, v=1 had cnt[v] = 0 and t[v] =0. So cnt[v] == t[v], and not on vacation. So this contributes to delta.

Thus, the delta is 1.

So, the idea is to count the number of ancestors where this condition is true before the increment.

Thus, the problem reduces to, for each query, count the number of ancestors in the path that meet this condition before the update.

But how to do this quickly.

Perhaps the solution is to use a binary indexed tree for each node's a and b values, combined with HLD.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of this problem, I think that the intended solution uses a heavy-light decomposition to manage the path updates and queries, combined with segment trees to track the a and b values.

But I'm not confident in this approach. However, given that the time is limited, I'll proceed with writing code that uses HLD for path updates and track the a and b values for each node.

But I'm not sure how to implement this correctly within the time constraints.

Another Idea: Since each query affects all ancestors of x, perhaps we can precompute for each node x the list of ancestors (parents up to root) and store them in a list. Then, for each query, we can iterate through this list and process each ancestor.

This is O(k) time per query, but for 1e5 queries and k up to 1e5, it's O(1e10), which is too slow.

But perhaps we can find that in practice, the average depth is small. For example, if the tree is a binary tree, the depth is log n, which is manageable. But for a chain, this is not.

But given that the problem's time limit is 5 seconds per test, perhaps this approach can pass.

Let's try this approach.

The steps are:

For each query:

1. Toggle the vacation status of x.

   a. For adding x: set vacation[x] = True. Compute if x was contributing to the total (not vacation and cnt[x] > t[x]) and subtract that from the total.

   b. For removing x: set vacation[x] = False. Compute if x's new state (not vacation and cnt[x] > t[x]) and add to the total.

2. For all ancestors v of x's parent:

   a. For adding: increment cnt[v] by 1.

   b. For removing: decrement cnt[v] by 1.

   c. For each v, check if their state (not vacation and cnt[v] > t[v]) has changed.

   d. For each v, compute the previous state and the new state. If the state changed, adjust the total accordingly.

But how to track the previous and new state.

For each ancestor v:

Previous state: old_state = (not vacation[v] and (old_cnt > t[v]))

new_cnt = old_cnt + delta (delta is ±1)

new_state = (not vacation[v] and (new_cnt > t[v]))

if old_state != new_state:

   if new_state:

      total +=1

   else:

      total -=1

Thus, for each ancestor v, this check is done.

But this requires O(k) operations per query.

In the worst case (chain), this is O(n) per query, which is O(1e10) operations. This is way too slow.

But perhaps with optimizations, like precomputing the ancestor paths for each node, and storing them in a list, this can be implemented quickly in practice.

For example, for each node x, precompute the list of ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) up to root. This can be done once in O(n) time.

Then, for each query, it's just a matter of iterating through this precomputed list.

But even with this, it's O(k) per query.

Given the time constraints, I'm not sure whether this approach is feasible.

But given the problem's sample input and explanation, this seems to be the intended approach.

But why?

In the sample input, the first query is adding employee 2. His ancestors are 4 and 1.

The code would increment their cnt:

- For 4: cnt increases from 0 to 1. t[4] is 1. So new cnt is 1, which is not greater than t[4]. So state remains not displeased.

- For 1: cnt increases from 0 to 1. t[1] is 0. So new cnt is 1 > 0. So state becomes displeased. So delta is +1.

Thus, the total increases by 1.

But how to track this.

The code would need to iterate through the ancestors of 2's parent (which is 4's parent, which is 1). Wait, wait, the query is adding x=2. His ancestors are parent (4), parent of 4 (1).

So for each ancestor v in the path (4, 1):

   delta = +1 for adding.

   old_cnt = cnt[v]

   new_cnt = old_cnt + delta.

   old_state = (not vacation[v] and old_cnt > t[v])

   new_state = (not vacation[v] and new_cnt > t[v])

   if old_state != new_state:

      if new_state:

         total += 1

      else:

         total -= 1

   cnt[v] = new_cnt

But this requires for each ancestor v, checking their vacation status and t.

But this approach is O(k) per query, which is the only way I can see to proceed.

So, let's proceed with this approach.

Now, to implement this:

We need to:

1. For each node, precompute the list of ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) up to root. This can be done with a depth-first traversal or via iterative parent lookup.

But for each node, this list can be computed once and stored.

However, for n=1e5 nodes, each with O(1e5) ancestors in the worst case, this would take O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Compute the ancestors on the fly for each query. For example, for each query x, iterate through the ancestors by following the parent links until root is reached. For each step, process the ancestor.

This would require O(k) time per query, but for a chain of 1e5 nodes, this is O(1e5) per query, leading to O(1e10) operations.

But in practice, the problem may not have such test cases, or the time limit may allow this.

But given the time constraints of 5 seconds per test case, and 1e5 queries, each with O(20) steps (for a balanced tree), this is feasible.

But for a chain, this would be 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach, possibly using the fact that the employees form a tree, and that the cnt for a node is the sum of all descendants (excluding the node) who are on vacation.

Thus, the cnt of a node is the number of nodes in its subtree (excluding itself) that are on vacation.

This is similar to a subtree sum problem.

Thus, the problem can be modeled as follows:

- Each node x's vacation status is a bit (0 or 1).

- For each node v, cnt[v] is the sum of the vacation status of all nodes in the subtree of v, excluding v.

Thus, the subtree sum for v is the sum of vacation status of all nodes in its subtree, which is cnt[v] + vacation[v] (since vacation[v] is not included in cnt[v]).

But for our problem, cnt[v] is the sum of the subtree of v, excluding v. So, when x's vacation status changes, the cnt of all ancestors of x's parent (since x is a subordinate of them) must be updated.

Thus, for each node x, when its vacation status changes to 1, the cnt of all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) must be increased by 1. When it changes to 0, they must be decreased by 1.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This is the same as the original problem.

But here's an insight: the cnt for each node v is exactly the number of nodes in the subtree of v (excluding v) that are on vacation. So, this can be represented as a sum over the subtree.

Thus, we can model this using a subtree sum data structure.

The best data structure for this is a heavy-light decomposition (HLD) with a segment tree or Fenwick tree that supports subtree sum queries and updates.

But no. Subtree updates are not directly supported by HLD. HLD is for path queries.

Alternatively, we can use an Euler Tour technique (ETT), which represents the tree as a flat array where the subtree of a node corresponds to a contiguous interval. This allows subtree sum queries and updates in O(log n) time.

Yes, this is possible.

Here's how:

1. Perform an Euler Tour of the tree, recording the in-time and out-time for each node. The in-time is the entry time during the DFS, and the out-time is the exit time. The nodes in the subtree of v will have in-time between v's in-time and out-time.

2. Represent the tree as a flat array where each node's vacation status is stored at its in-time position.

3. Use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to support range sum queries and point updates.

4. For a node v, the cnt[v] is the sum of the vacation status of all nodes in the subtree of v, excluding v. So, it is the sum from in[v]+1 to out[v].

Because the subtree of v includes v's children, their in-time and out-time are within v's in-time and out-time.

Thus, the sum from in[v]+1 to out[v] gives the number of subordinates of v (excluding v) that are on vacation.

Thus, to compute cnt[v], we can query the Fenwick tree for the range sum from in[v]+1 to out[v].

But this requires O(1) or O(log n) time per query.

But for each query, we need to update the vacation status of x (point update), and then for each ancestor v of x's parent, compute their cnt[v] and check if it exceeds t[v].

Wait, no. Because when x's vacation status changes, it affects the cnt of all ancestors of x's parent. Because x is a subordinate of those ancestors.

But according to the ETT approach, x's own vacation status is stored in the array. The cnt of x's parent is the sum of x's vacation status plus the vacation status of other subordinates.

So, when x's vacation status changes, the cnt of all ancestors of x's parent is updated by delta.

But how to model this.

The problem is that x's vacation status is in the subtree of x's parent, which is part of the subtree of x's grandparent, etc. Thus, when x is added to vacation, the sum for x's parent's subtree increases by 1, which is reflected in the Fenwick tree.

But the cnt for x's parent is the sum of their subtree (excluding themselves), which includes x's vacation status.

But the cnt for x's parent is already computed as the sum of their subtree (excluding themselves). So, when x's vacation status is updated, the Fenwick tree's sum for the parent's subtree (excluding parent) changes by 1. So, we can compute cnt[v] for any node v by querying the sum of their subtree (excluding themselves) using the Fenwick tree.

Thus, the steps are:

For each query:

1. Toggle the vacation status of x (point update in the Fenwick tree).

2. For each ancestor v of x's parent (i.e., parent of x, grandparent, etc. up to root):

   a. Compute the current cnt[v] as the sum of the subtree of v (excluding v).

   b. Check if vacation[v] is False and cnt[v] > t[v].

But again, this requires O(k) steps per query.

But with this approach, the problem is that for each ancestor v, we need to query the Fenwick tree for their subtree sum, which is O(log n) time per ancestor.

Thus, for a chain of 1e5 nodes, this is O(1e5 log n) per query, which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach doesn't solve the time complexity issue.

At this point, I'm out of ideas. It's possible that the intended solution is to process each query in O(k) time, and rely on the fact that the test cases are not worst-case. But given the time constraints, I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct approach is to model the cnt[v] for each node as a dynamic value, updated by adding or subtracting 1 along the path from x's parent to root. Then, for each such ancestor v, check if their state has changed.

Thus, the code will look like this:

Read the input, build the tree structure.

For each node, precompute its depth and ancestors (but not store them, as that's not possible for large n).

For each query, process the following steps:

1. Toggle the vacation status of x.

   a. If adding x: set vacation[x] = True, delta = 1.

   b. If removing x: set vacation[x] = False, delta = -1.

2. Compute the initial contribution of x to the total.

   a. If adding: x's contribution is subtracted if it was previously contributing.

   b. If removing: x's contribution is added if it now contributes.

3. For each ancestor v of x (parent, grandparent, ...), processed in order:

   a. old_cnt = cnt[v]

   b. new_cnt = old_cnt + delta

   c. old_state = not vacation[v] and (old_cnt > t[v])

   d. new_state = not vacation[v] and (new_cnt > t[v])

   e. if old_state != new_state:

      if new_state:

          total +=1

      else:

          total -=1

   f. cnt[v] = new_cnt

But for large n, this is O(k) per query.

But this is the only way I can see to proceed.

Thus, the code would be:

Read the tree, build the parent array.

For each query, follow the parent links and process each ancestor.

But for n=1e5, this is O(m * depth) time.

But perhaps in practice, this code can pass with some optimizations.

Let's test this approach on the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

7 8

4 5 1 1 5 5

0 0 0 1 2 0 0

2 6 3 7 -2 4 -3 1

Sample Output:

1 1 1 2 2 2 1 0

Let's walk through the first query.

Query 1: +2 (add 2 to vacation).

Processing:

vacation[2] is False → set to True.

x is 2.

Now, check x's previous contribution: before, vacation[2] was False, and cnt[2] is the number of his subordinates on vacation (subordinates are 3). Initially, no one is on vacation. So cnt[2] was 0. t[2] is 0. So 0 > 0? No. So no contribution.

Thus, no change to the total.

Now, process the ancestors of x's parent (which is 4). The ancestors are 4 and 1.

For each ancestor v in order (4, 1):

v=4:

old_cnt = 0 (initially no subordinates on vacation).

new_cnt = 0 +1 =1.

t[4] is 1.

old_state: not vacation[4] (True) and 0>1 → False.

new_state: True and 1>1 → False.

No change. So total remains.

cnt[4] becomes 1.

v=1:

old_cnt is 0 (no subordinates on vacation).

new_cnt =1.

t[1] is 0.

old_state: True and 0>0 → False.

new_state: True and 1>0 → True.

So delta +=1. total becomes 1.

cnt[1] is now 1.

Thus, after first query, total is 1, which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach works.

But for large n, this approach is too slow.

Thus, the code would be:

Read n and m.

Read the parent array.

Build the parent pointers for each node.

Read t array.

Initialize:

vacation = [False] * (n+1)

cnt = [0]*(n+1)

total = 0

For each query q in q_1 to q_m:

x = abs(q)

delta = 1 if q >0 else -1

if q>0:

   # adding x to vacation

   # check if x was already on vacation

   if vacation[x]:

       continue

   vacation[x] = True

   # subtract previous contribution of x

   prev_cnt_x = cnt[x]

   if not vacation[x] and prev_cnt_x > t[x]:

       total -=1

   # process ancestors of x's parent

   current = parent[x]

else:

   # removing x from vacation

   if not vacation[x]:

       continue

   vacation[x] = False

   # check if x now contributes

   current_cnt_x = cnt[x]

   if not vacation[x] and current_cnt_x > t[x]:

       total +=1

   # process ancestors of x's parent

   current = parent[x]

Wait, no. For adding x, we process the ancestors of x's parent, because x's parent's cnt increases by 1.

But x's parent's cnt is the number of subordinates (including x) on vacation.

So, when x is added to vacation, all ancestors of x (parent, grandparent, etc.) have their cnt increased by 1.

Thus, the code must process all ancestors of x's parent, not x's parent itself.

Wait, no. x's parent's cnt is the number of subordinates (including x) on vacation. So, when x is added to vacation, the parent's cnt increases by 1.

Thus, the code must process x's parent and all ancestors of x's parent.

Thus, the code should start with current = parent[x], and iterate up to root.

Thus, the code:

for each query:

   if adding x:

       vacation[x] = True

       # x's own contribution is now 0 (since he is on vacation)

       # previous contribution was (not vacation[x] and cnt[x] > t[x])

       prev_contrib = (False and ...) → no.

       so no change to total.

       # process ancestors of x's parent

       current = parent[x]

   else:

       # removing x

       vacation[x] = False

       # x's new contribution is (True and cnt[x] > t[x])

       # but cnt[x] may have changed due to previous steps.

       # but after removing x from vacation, his subordinates' cnt are not affected.

       # so cnt[x] remains the same.

       # thus, compute current_cnt_x = cnt[x]

       # if current_cnt_x > t[x], add 1 to total.

       current_contrib = (not vacation[x]) and (cnt[x] > t[x])

       if current_contrib:

           total +=1

       current = parent[x]

   while current is not None:

       old_cnt = cnt[current]

       new_cnt = old_cnt + delta

       old_state = (not vacation[current]) and (old_cnt > t[current])

       new_state = (not vacation[current]) and (new_cnt > t[current])

       if old_state != new_state:

           if new_state:

               total +=1

           else:

               total -=1

       cnt[current] = new_cnt

       current = parent[current]

But wait, when adding x, delta is 1.

When removing x, delta is -1.

This code would process all ancestors of x's parent.

But this is O(k) per query.

But for the sample input, this code would work.

But for large n, this is O(m * k) time.

Thus, the code is correct but may not pass the time constraints.

But given that the problem's time limit is 5 seconds and that the code is optimized, perhaps it's possible to pass.

But for the worst case, this code will TLE.

But given that this is the only approach I can think of, I'll proceed to write this code.

Now, implement this in Python.

But how to handle the parent array.

The parent array is given for employees 2..n.

So, for employee 2 to n, p_2 is the parent of 2.

We can build a parent array where parent[i] is the parent of i.

The root is 1, which has no parent.

So, for each employee i from 2 to n, parent[i] = p_i.

Thus, parent is a list where parent[i] is the manager of i.

Thus, to find the ancestors of x's parent, we start with parent[x], then parent[parent[x]], and so on until we reach 1.

In code:

parent = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(2, n+1):

   parent[i] = p[i-2]

Then, for a node x, its parent is parent[x].

Thus, in the code, for each query:

x = abs(q)

if q>0:

   # adding x

   if vacation[x]:

       # ignore, but according to problem statement, queries are valid.

       # so according to problem statement, this will not happen.

   vacation[x] = True

   # previous contribution was (not vacation[x] (False) and ... → no.

   # no need to subtract.

   # process ancestors of x's parent.

   current = parent[x]

   delta = 1

else:

   # removing x.

   if not vacation[x]:

       # impossible per problem statement.

   vacation[x] = False

   # compute current contribution.

   current_contrib = (not vacation[x]) and (cnt[x] > t[x-1])

   if current_contrib:

       total += current_contrib

   current = parent[x]

   delta = -1

Then, for each current in the path:

   old_cnt = cnt[current]

   new_cnt = old_cnt + delta

   old_state = (not vacation[current]) and (old_cnt > t[current-1])

   new_state = (not vacation[current]) and (new_cnt > t[current-1])

   if old_state != new_state:

       if new_state:

           total +=1

       else:

           total -=1

   cnt[current] = new_cnt

   current = parent[current]

Thus, this code should work.

Testing on the sample input:

Sample input 1:

n=7, m=8.

parent array for 2-7: 4,5,1,1,5,5.

So:

parent[2]=4

parent[3]=5

parent[4]=1

parent[5]=1

parent[6]=5

parent[7]=5

t array: [0,0,0,1,2,0,0] → indices 0-6 for employees 1-7.

When query is +2:

delta=1.

current=4.

old_cnt=0 → new_cnt=1.

t[current-1] is t[3] (since current is 4, index is 3) which is 1.

old_state: not vacation[4] → True, old_cnt=0 >1? No → False.

new_state: 1>1? No → False. So no change.

cnt[4] becomes 1.

current=parent[4] =1.

old_cnt=0 → new_cnt=1.

t[0] =0.

old_state: not vacation[1] (True), 0>0 → False.

new_state: 1>0 → True. So, delta +=1.

total becomes 1.

cnt[1] becomes 1.

current=parent[1] is None. Stop.

Thus, output is 1.

Which matches.

Thus, this code works.

But for large n, this is too slow.

But perhaps with some optimizations, such as precomputing the entire ancestor path for each node and storing it in a list, but that's not possible for 1e5 nodes.

Alternatively, use a while loop to follow the parent until current is None.

Thus, the code is correct but may TLE for large inputs.

But given the problem's time limit, and the fact that Python is slow, this code may not pass.

But perhaps with PyPy, it's possible. But the problem states that the code must be in Python 3.

Thus, this approach is the best I can think of.

Now, implementing this code:

Read n and m.

Read p_2 to p_n: list of parents.

Read t_1 to t_n: list of t.

Read the m queries.

Initialize:

vacation = [False] * (n+1)

cnt = [0]*(n+1)

total =0

parent = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(2, n+1):

   parent[i] = p[i-2]

Then process each query:

output = []

for q in queries:

   x = abs(q)

   if q >0:

       # adding x to vacation.

       if vacation[x]:

           # invalid, but according to problem statement, this won't happen.

           # proceed.

       vacation[x] = True

       delta =1

       # check if x's previous contribution:

       # since x is now on vacation, his previous contribution is (not vacation[x] (False) and ... → no.

       # no need to subtract.

       current = parent[x]

   else:

       # removing x from vacation.

       if not vacation[x]:

           # invalid.

           # proceed.

       vacation[x] = False

       delta =-1

       # check x's new contribution:

       current_contrib = (not vacation[x]) and (cnt[x] > t[x-1])

       if current_contrib:

           total +=1

       current = parent[x]

   # process the ancestors.

   while current !=0:

       old_cnt = cnt[current]

       new_cnt = old_cnt + delta

       old_state = (not vacation[current]) and (old_cnt > t[current-1])

       new_state = (not vacation[current]) and (new_cnt > t[current-1])

       if old_state != new_state:

           if new_state:

               total +=1

           else:

               total -=1

       cnt[current] = new_cnt

       current = parent[current]

   output.append(total)

print(' '.join(map(str, output)))

But in the code, parent[1] is 0, since it's the root.

But in the parent array, for employee 1, parent[1] is 0.

Thus, the loop 'current !=0' will stop when current is 0.

Thus, this code should work.

Testing against sample input 1.
