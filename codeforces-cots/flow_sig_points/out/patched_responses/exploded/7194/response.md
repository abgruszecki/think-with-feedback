Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So Mashmokh has a tree structure where each node (except the root) can have some water poured into it initially. Then, there's this process where each step involves moving water up the tree unless a node's door is closed. The goal is to maximize the maximum amount of water in the root after any step, considering that closing doors costs coins based on the water in the closed tanks during that step. The total coins spent mustn't exceed p.

Hmm. So first, the problem is about selecting which nodes to put water in (up to k liters total), and then during each step, choosing which nodes to close to minimize the coins spent, but in a way that allows the maximum possible root water in any step.

Wait, but the coins are the sum of the closed nodes' water during each move. So the total coins used over all moves is the sum over each move of the sum of w (water in closed nodes) during that move. And that sum has to be ≤ p.

But how do the steps work? Let me re-read the process.

At each step:

1. All doors are open initially.
2. Mashmokh closes some doors (can't close root). For each closed door, he pays w coins, where w is the current amount of water in that tank.
3. Then, process the nodes in order of non-decreasing depth (so root first, then its children, then next level, etc). For each node, if its door is open, move all its water to the parent.

So each step is a move where some doors are closed. The root is emptied first (so all its water is collected as part of that step's w_i), but then the other nodes' water is moved up if their door is open.

Wait, the root's tank is emptied in the first part of the step. So after emptying, the root's water is added to the step's w_i. Then, for other nodes, if their door is open, their water is moved to the parent. But since the root is processed first, maybe that's part of the steps.

So the key is that in each step, the root's current water is added to w_i (the maximum of these is the target), and then the rest of the nodes' water is moved up if possible. But doors can be closed in each step, which stops their water from moving that step.

The challenge is to model how the initial placement of water (selecting nodes to add 1 liter each, up to k) and the closing of doors in each step affects the maximum root water in any step.

The problem requires us to find the maximum possible max(w_1, w_2, ..., w_l), given that the sum of the coins used (sum over all steps of sum of w in closed doors during that step) is ≤ p.

So the approach is to:

1. Decide which nodes to initially place water (each node can have 0 or 1 liters, and total ≤k).
2. Then, for each step, decide which nodes to close (not root) to manage the flow of water, ensuring that the coins used don't exceed p.
3. Find the arrangement that maximizes the maximum w_i.

But since k and p can be up to 1e9, we need an approach that's O(m) or O(m log m) time.

First, let's think about the structure of the tree. Each node's depth (distance from root) is important. Because when water is in a node at depth d, it takes d steps to reach the root if no doors are closed. For example, a node at depth 2: in the first step, if the door is open, its water moves to the parent (depth 1). Then, in the next step, if the parent's door is open, that water moves to the root. So it takes two steps.

But if doors are closed, perhaps the water can be delayed. For example, closing the node's door in step 1, then allowing it to move in step 2. Then the parent's door can be closed in step 2, so the water moves to the root in step 3.

Wait, but each step involves moving all possible water up. So the process is:

At each step, the root's current water is collected (w_i is set to that amount). Then, for each node in order of depth (from shallow to deep), if the door is open, all water is moved to the parent.

So, for a node at depth d, if all doors along the path to the root are open in all steps, then the water will reach the root in exactly d steps.

But by closing certain doors in certain steps, we can delay the arrival of the water to the root, which might allow more water to accumulate in the root in a single step.

The key is to determine for each node, how much we can delay its water's arrival to the root, given the coins available. Each time we close a door along the path in a certain step, that costs coins equal to the water present in that door's node during that step.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to model each node's contribution to the root's steps.

Suppose a node is at depth d. Its 1 liter of water will take exactly t steps to reach the root, where t is the number of steps needed for it to reach the root. Each step along the path (each ancestor) must have their doors open for the water to move up. But perhaps the optimal strategy is to have the water arrive at the root in a certain step, such that this step's w_i is as large as possible.

Alternatively, for each node, the water's arrival time to the root is determined by the sum of the delays introduced by closing doors along the path.

But how do we model the cost of these delays?

Another thought: For a node at depth d, the earliest possible arrival is d steps (all doors open). Each time we close a door in some step, the arrival is delayed by one step. But each such closure costs coins equal to the amount of water in the door's node at that step.

Wait, maybe each node's water can take various paths through the steps, with the arrival time determined by how many times doors along its path to the root were closed during its movement.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of each node's water's journey as a sequence of steps. For each step t, the water can move up a level if the door is open. Otherwise, it remains until the next step.

So for a node at depth d, the time it takes for the water to reach the root is the depth d plus the number of times any of its ancestors (including itself) had their doors closed during the steps when the water was in that node.

But modeling this for all nodes would be difficult. Instead, perhaps we can find that the optimal way is to have each node's water arrive in a specific step, and the cost is the sum of the coins required to delay the arrival to that step.

Wait, let's model each node's contribution. Let's say a node is at depth d. For its 1 liter of water, the earliest it can reach the root is d steps. But if we delay it by s steps, then it arrives in d + s steps. For each such delay s, there's a cost involved.

But how much does it cost to delay by s steps?

Each step of delay requires that the water is blocked at some node along the path. For example, if we delay the arrival by one step, that could be because we closed the door of the node itself (at depth d) once. Then, during that step, the water remains in the node, costing 1 coin (since w is 1 in that step). Then in the next step, the door is open, and the water moves up.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is s, because each step of delay requires paying 1 coin. Because, each step of delay is caused by a closure that occurs when the water is in some node. For example, if the delay is s steps, then during s different steps, the water was blocked. Each such closure adds to the cost.

Wait, maybe for each node's 1 liter of water, the number of steps it is delayed is s, and the cost is s. Because each step that the water is in a node (including itself) during a closure adds 1 to the cost.

For example, if the water is in a node x (depth d) during step t, and the door of x is closed in step t, then the cost increases by the amount of water in x at that step. Since the water is 1 (from the initial), and when x's door is closed in step t, that adds 1 to the total cost.

Wait, but in this case, the cost per node's liter is equal to the number of times it was closed. Because each time it is closed, the cost increases by 1 (since the water is in that node).

So for each node's liter, if we close the node's door once during its journey (when the water is present there), that costs 1. Similarly, closing the door of its parent once during the journey would cost 1, but only when the water is in the parent.

But how do these closures affect the arrival time?

Let me think of an example. Suppose a node is at depth 2.

- Earliest arrival: step 2. Cost is 0.

But suppose we want to delay arrival to step 3.

In step 1, the water is in depth 2. We close the door here: cost 1. The water remains. Then, in step 2, the door is open. The water moves to depth 1. Then in step 3, the door of depth 1 is closed: cost 1. Water remains. In step 4, the door is open, and the water moves to root. So arrival is step 4. The cost is 2.

So each step of delay adds a cost of 1. So the total delay s is equal to the cost for that node.

Wait, but this may not be the case. Let me think again.

Suppose the node is at depth d. The minimal arrival is d steps, and each step of delay beyond that requires s steps, each of which corresponds to a closure in one of the nodes along the path. Each such closure contributes 1 to the cost. So the cost for delaying s steps is s.

Thus, for each node, the arrival time is t = d + s, and the cost is s. So the total cost for that node is s. And the maximum arrival time is when the root's water in that step is increased by 1 (since the 1 liter arrives in that step).

So the problem reduces to:

For each node (except root) that we choose to place a liter (total ≤k liters), assign a delay s_i ≥0. The sum of s_i across all selected nodes must be ≤p. For each node i, the arrival time is (d_i + s_i). Then, the maximum number of nodes that arrive at the same time (their d_i + s_i) is the maximum w_i (since in that step, the root's w is the sum of all nodes arriving at that step). So the goal is to select nodes and assign s_i such that:

sum(s_i) ≤ p

sum(1 for each node selected) ≤k

And the maximum count of nodes arriving at the same time is as large as possible.

Ah! This seems like the key insight. Because each node's 1 liter contributes to the root's w in the step when it arrives. So, if many nodes' arrival times are set to the same step t, then w_t is the number of such nodes. So the maximum over all t is the value we need to maximize.

So the problem becomes: select a subset of nodes (size up to k), assign each a delay s_i (≥0) such that sum(s_i) ≤p, and arrange the arrival times (d_i + s_i) such that the maximum frequency (number of nodes arriving at the same t) is as large as possible.

Therefore, our task is to select nodes and assign s_i to maximize the maximum frequency of (d_i + s_i), subject to sum(s_i) ≤p and the number of selected nodes is ≤k.

So how can we model this?

The optimal approach is to select a target time t, and find the maximum number of nodes that can have their arrival time adjusted to t (by setting s_i = t -d_i) such that s_i ≥0 (so t ≥d_i), the sum of s_i (sum(t -d_i) for the selected nodes) is ≤p, and the number of nodes is ≤k.

Then, the answer is the maximum possible count over all possible t.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

1. For each node, compute its depth d_i. The root (node 1) is depth 0. Its children are depth 1, etc.

2. Sort all non-root nodes by their depth.

3. For each possible t, find the maximum number of nodes in a subset S such that:

   a. All nodes in S have d_i ≤t.

   b. The sum of (t -d_i) for nodes in S is ≤p.

   c. |S| ≤k.

   Then, the maximum |S| over all possible t is the answer.

But since t can be up to something large (like d_i can be up to m-1, and p can be up to 1e9), we need a way to compute for all possible t the maximum possible count of nodes that can be selected, with sum(t -d_i) ≤p and count ≤k.

We need to find the maximum possible count, considering all t.

But how?

First, for each node, the minimal possible t is d_i (when s_i=0). The maximal t is unbounded, but since sum(t -d_i) increases as t increases, for each group of nodes, the sum will eventually exceed p. So the maximum possible t for a group is when sum(t -d_i) ≤p.

But given that, perhaps the optimal t is such that the nodes are grouped by their d_i, and we can find for each possible group of nodes with d_i <= t, the maximum possible t where sum(t -d_i) for that group is <=p, and the group size is <=k.

But considering all possible t is not feasible. Instead, perhaps for each possible group of nodes (sorted by depth), we can compute the maximum possible number of nodes from that group that can be selected with sum(t -d_i) ≤p and t >=d_i, and then the maximum t for that group.

Wait, but the nodes' depths are sorted. Let's say we sort all non-root nodes by their depth in ascending order. Then, for a given group of the first x nodes (sorted by depth), what is the minimal possible sum of (t -d_i) for all i in the group, given that t must be >=d_i for all i in the group. The minimal sum is when t is the maximum depth in the group, which is d_x. Because if t is the maximum depth in the group (d_x), then for all nodes in the group, t >=d_i. So sum(t -d_i) = sum_{i=1}^x (d_x -d_i).

If sum(d_x -d_i) <=p, then for this group, we can select x nodes, and assign t =d_x. The sum is sum(d_x -d_i) = x*d_x - sum(d_i). Then, the maximum count is x, and the sum must be <=p. Also, x must be <=k.

But maybe there's a larger t that allows including more nodes. Wait, no, because the group is sorted by depth, adding nodes with larger depth would require a larger t.

Alternatively, for a group of nodes with d_i sorted in increasing order, the optimal t for that group would be the maximum d_i in the group. Because if you choose a t larger than that, the sum would be sum(t -d_i) = (t -d_x) * x + sum(d_x -d_i). Since (t -d_x) is positive, increasing t increases the sum, which may exceed p. So to minimize the sum, for a group of x nodes, the minimal sum is sum(d_x -d_i), which occurs when t=d_x.

But the group can be extended by including nodes with d_i <=t, but perhaps t can be higher than the maximum d_i of the group, allowing more nodes to be added. Wait, no. Because in that case, the group would have to include nodes with d_i <= t, but sorted by depth, so perhaps the group is not the first x nodes.

But this seems complicated. Let's think differently.

Suppose we have all the non-root nodes sorted by their depth. Let's compute a prefix sum of their depths. Let S[x] be the sum of the first x nodes' depths.

Then, for a group of x nodes, the minimal possible sum of (t -d_i) is x*t - S[x], where t >= max_depth_in_group (which is d_{x-1} if 0-based, or d_x if 1-based). Wait, assuming the first x nodes in the sorted list are considered. Since they are sorted by depth, the maximum depth in the first x nodes is the x-th node's depth.

So, the sum of (t -d_i) is x*t - S[x]. To minimize this sum (so that it's as small as possible, thus allowing more nodes to be selected), we set t to the maximum depth in the group (the x-th node's depth). So sum = x*d_x - S[x], where d_x is the x-th node's depth (since the nodes are sorted in non-decreasing order). If this sum is <=p, then we can select x nodes, and the sum is acceptable. Additionally, x must be <=k.

But if x*d_x - S[x] > p, then even the minimal possible sum (t=d_x) is too big. So x nodes can't be selected.

Alternatively, if x is large, perhaps for a smaller x, the sum is acceptable, and the maximum count is found.

So the approach is to sort all non-root nodes by depth in non-decreasing order, compute the prefix sums, and then for each possible x (number of nodes selected), check if x*d_x - S[x] <=p and x <=k. The maximum x where this holds is a candidate for the answer.

But this is under the assumption that for x nodes, we set t=d_x. But maybe there exists a larger t that allows more nodes to be selected with sum(t' -d_i) <=p.

Wait, for example, suppose after selecting x nodes (the first x in sorted list), but there's another node with depth d' >=d_x. If we include this node (x+1 nodes), then the minimal sum for x+1 nodes would be (x+1)*d_{x+1} - S[x+1]. If this is <=p, then we can include it. But how does this affect the sum?

Alternatively, for x nodes, perhaps the optimal t is not d_x, but higher. Because if we increase t beyond d_x, the sum becomes x*(t -d_x) + (x*d_x - S[x]). So sum = x*(t -d_x) + (x*d_x - S[x]) ) = x*t - S[x]. Which is the same as before.

Wait, but if t is increased beyond d_x, then sum(t -d_i) for the x nodes is x*t - S[x], which is larger than x*d_x - S[x]. So the sum would increase. So for x nodes, the minimal sum is x*d_x - S[x], which is the minimal possible. So if x*d_x - S[x] <=p, then even larger t would require more sum, but it's allowed. But for the purpose of selecting x nodes, the sum is minimized when t=d_x, which is necessary to check if it's feasible.

But the problem is that when we select x nodes, we can choose a larger t (than d_x) to allow more nodes (x + y) to be included. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to select the largest possible x such that x <=k, and x*d_x - S[x] <=p. Because if you can select x nodes with sum x*d_x - S[x] <=p, then that's the maximum possible for that x. If not, try x-1, etc.

But how do we find the maximum x where x <=k and x*d_x - S[x] <=p.

So the plan is:

1. Sort all non-root nodes by depth in non-decreasing order.

2. Compute the prefix sum array S, where S[x] is the sum of the first x nodes' depths.

3. Iterate x from 1 to possible max (up to m-1), and check if x <=k and x*d[x] - S[x] <=p. The maximum x that satisfies this is a candidate.

But what about larger x? For example, after x, there may be nodes with higher depth. If we take x nodes with sum x*d_x - S[x] <=p, and then add another node (x+1) with depth d_{x+1} >=d_x, then the sum would be (x+1)*d_{x+1} - S[x+1]. But since d_{x+1} >=d_x, the sum for x+1 could be larger or smaller than p.

But the key is that for x to be the maximum possible, we need the sum for x nodes to be feasible, and for x+1 nodes to be not feasible.

But this is not the case. Maybe for x=5, the sum is feasible, and x=6 is also feasible. So the maximum x would be as large as possible.

So to find the maximum possible x, we can binary search on x. For each possible x (from 0 to min(k, m-1)), check if x*d_x - S[x] <=p. If yes, then x is a candidate. The maximum x is the largest x where this holds.

But how do we handle the sorted list of nodes and compute S[x]?

Let me think about the steps:

- Compute all non-root nodes' depths.

- Sort them in non-decreasing order.

- Compute the prefix sums S[0] =0, S[1] = d_1, S[2] = d_1 +d_2, etc.

Then for x, the sum is x*d_x - S[x]. We need to find the maximum x where x <=k and x*d_x - S[x] <=p.

Yes. So the maximum possible x for which x is the number of nodes selected (the first x in the sorted list) and the sum is within p. Also, x can't exceed the total number of non-root nodes (m-1).

So the steps to compute the answer are:

1. Compute the depth of each non-root node.

2. Sort the depths in non-decreasing order.

3. Compute the prefix sum array S.

4. For each x from 0 to min(k, m-1), check if x*d_x (where d_x is the x-th node's depth in the sorted list) minus S[x] is ≤p. The maximum x where this is true is the answer candidate.

But also, since the sorted list is in non-decreasing order, d_x is >=d_{x-1}, etc. So for x+1, the sum could be larger but x+1 may be allowed.

So the binary search approach would work here. Let's think:

We can binary search on x, but since x can't exceed min(k, m-1), we can iterate x from 0 up to that and compute the maximum x where the condition holds. However, for m up to 1e5, a linear scan is O(m), which is acceptable.

But perhaps we can do better. Since the sorted list is in non-decreasing order, the sum x*d_x - S[x] increases as x increases. Because d_x increases (since sorted), and each x term is multiplied by a larger d_x.

Wait, for example, if x increases by 1, then:

sum_new = x_new * d_new - S_new.

Assuming the new node has d_new >= previous d_x.

But x increases by 1, and d_new >=d_x. So x_new * d_new is (x+1)*d_new, which is >= (x+1)*d_x. The previous sum is x*d_x - S[x]. So sum_new can be larger or smaller than previous sum.

But overall, the sum x*d_x - S[x] may not be monotonic. For example, when adding a node with a much larger d, the sum could jump up.

This makes binary search difficult. So perhaps a linear scan is needed.

But for m up to 1e5, a linear scan is O(m), which is acceptable.

So the approach is:

- Sort the depths.

- Compute prefix sum.

- Iterate x from 0 to min(k, len(depths)):

   For each x, check if x <=k, and x*d[x-1] (since in 0-based) - S[x] <=p.

Wait, let's clarify the indexes.

Assume the sorted depths array is d[0], d[1], ..., d[n-1], where n is the number of non-root nodes (m-1). Then, the prefix sum S[x] is sum(d[0..x-1]). So for x nodes (the first x in the list), the maximum depth is d[x-1]. So the sum is x * d[x-1] - S[x], where S[x] is sum of first x nodes.

Yes.

So, for each x from 0 to min(k, n), where n = m-1:

   if x ==0: sum is 0, which is allowed (but contributes nothing to the answer).

   else: check x <=k and x*d[x-1] - S[x] <=p.

   The maximum x where this is true is the candidate.

Additionally, we need to compare with the maximum possible individual steps.

Wait, but the answer is the maximum possible x (the number of nodes selected) that can be assigned to a common t, which is the maximum d in the group. So the maximum x is the maximum possible.

But there's another possibility: perhaps selecting some nodes with different d_i and s_i such that their arrival times t_i =d_i + s_i are the same, but not necessarily the maximum d of the group.

But this would require that the sum of s_i (t -d_i) is <=p, and the number of nodes is as large as possible. However, this is more complex than the previous approach.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the approach of considering the sorted nodes and checking the x where sum(x*d_x - S[x]) <=p is the best, and the correct answer is the maximum x found this way.

But why is this approach correct? Because it's the minimal possible sum for x nodes. If there exists a way to select x nodes with sum <=p by choosing a larger t, then the sum would be higher. So the minimal sum is when t is the maximum depth of the group. So if that sum is <=p, then x is a candidate. Otherwise, even with a larger t, the sum would be higher. So this approach finds the maximum x where the minimal possible sum is acceptable.

But perhaps there are other ways to select x nodes where the sum is lower. For example, choosing a subset of x nodes where their maximum depth is lower than the x-th node in the sorted list. But then, the sum would be x*t - sum(d_i), where t is the maximum depth of the subset. However, since the nodes are sorted, the maximum depth of the subset is at least the maximum depth of the first x nodes. So any subset of x nodes would have a maximum depth >= the x-th node in the sorted list. Thus, the minimal possible sum for x nodes is achieved by selecting the first x nodes and setting t=d_x, which is their maximum depth.

Therefore, the approach is correct.

So the steps are:

- Compute the depth of each non-root node.

- Sort them in non-decreasing order.

- Compute prefix sums.

- Iterate x from 0 to min(k, m-1), compute the sum x*d[x-1] - S[x]. If the sum is <=p, then x is a candidate. The maximum x is the answer.

But wait, the answer could also be higher than this x. For example, if there are nodes that can be assigned to a higher t, allowing more nodes to be selected.

Wait, no. Because in this approach, x is the maximum number of nodes that can be selected, given that their minimal sum is acceptable. Any other way of selecting nodes (either more nodes or same nodes but with higher sum) would require sum to be <=p. But since this approach finds the maximum x where the sum is acceptable, it's the best possible.

Wait, no. Because perhaps selecting x nodes with a higher t (sum is x*t - sum(d_i) <=p). For example, if t is higher than d[x-1], then sum would be larger. But if x is larger than min(k, m-1), but that's not possible. So the x is limited by the number of nodes and k.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to select more than x nodes, but some have s_i negative (which isn't allowed). So no.

So the maximum possible answer is the largest x where x <=k and x*d[x-1] - S[x] <=p.

So, in code:

We read the tree, compute the depth of each non-root node. Sort them. Compute prefix sums. Then iterate x from 0 to possible maximum (min(k, len(depths))), compute sum x*d[x-1] - S[x], and find the maximum x where sum <=p.

But how do we compute the depths?

We can perform BFS starting from the root (node 1) to compute the depth for each node.

Yes.

So the code steps:

Read m, k, p.

Read m-1 edges, build adjacency list.

Compute depths via BFS.

Collect all depths except the root (node 1, depth 0) into a list.

Sort the list.

Compute prefix sums.

Iterate x from 0 up to min(k, len(depths)), compute sum x*d[x-1] - S[x], and check sum <=p.

But in code, the sorted list is in non-decreasing order. So for x nodes, the maximum depth is the last element in the first x nodes (d_sorted[x-1] if 0-based).

Wait, but when x is zero, there are no nodes.

So, for each x in 0 to min(k, len(depths)):

   if x ==0:

      sum is 0, which is allowed. The answer is 0, but since it's the first step, the maximum is 0.

   else:

      sum = x * d_sorted[x-1] - prefix[x]

      if sum <=p and x <=k:

          current_max = max(current_max, x)

The maximum x found is the answer.

So this approach is O(m) for BFS, O(m log m) for sorting, and O(m) for the iteration.

With m up to 1e5, this is acceptable.

But let's test with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

10 2 1

Tree edges as per the example. The root is 1.

The depths of the non-root nodes are:

Let's see. The tree's structure:

Root (1) has children 2,3.

3 has children 4,5.

2 has child 6.

6 has children 8,7.

8 has child 9,10.

So depths:

node 2: depth 1.

node3: 1.

node4: 2 (child of 3).

node5: 2 (child of 3).

node6: 2 (child of 2).

node7:3 (child of 6).

node8:3 (child of 6).

node9:4 (child of 8).

node10:4 (child of 8).

So the sorted list of depths (excluding root) is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].

So len is 9.

prefix sum S is:

x=0:0

x=1:1

x=2:1+1=2

x=3:2+2=4

x=4:4+2=6

x=5:6+3=9

x=6:9+3=12

x=7:12+4=16

x=8:16+4=20

x=9:20+4=24 (but wait, there's only 9 nodes? Wait, the sample input has 10 nodes, so non-root nodes are 9. So the sorted list is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4]. So sorted depths in non-decreasing order.

So for x=2 (the first two nodes have depths 1 and 1). The sum is 2 *1 (d[x-1] = d[1] =1) minus prefix[2] = 2. So sum is 2*1 -2 =0 <=1. So x=2 is allowed. So the answer could be 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Yes, the sample output is 2. So this approach works.

Another sample input:

Tree structure: root 1 has children 2,3. 3 has children 4,5.

Depths for non-root nodes:

2:1, 3:1, 4:2,5:2.

Sorted depths: [1,1,2,2].

prefix sum S[0] =0, S[1]=1, S[2]=2, S[3]=4, S[4]=6.

For x=4:

sum is 4 *2 (d[3] is 2) - S[4] = 8 -6 =2 <=1000. So x=4 is allowed. Also, 4 <=1000. So the answer is 4.

Which matches the second sample.

So this approach seems correct.

Now, the code:

First, compute the depths using BFS.

Then, collect the non-root nodes' depths, sort them.

Compute the prefix sum.

Iterate x from 0 to min(k, len(depths)), compute the sum and track the maximum x where sum <=p.

So code steps:

Read m, k, p.

Read m-1 edges, build adjacency list.

BFS from node 1 to compute depths.

Collect the depths of nodes except root.

Sort the list in non-decreasing order.

Compute prefix sum array.

Iterate x from 0 to min(k, len(depths)), and compute sum x * d[x-1] - S[x].

But need to handle x=0.

Wait, for x=0, sum is 0, which is allowed. But since no nodes are selected, the maximum w_i is 0, but the sample shows that the answer can be higher. Wait, no. Because in the first sample, when x=2, sum is 0, which is allowed. So when x=2 is selected, the answer is 2.

So the code:

max_ans =0

prefix = [0]

for i in range(len(depths)):

    prefix.append( prefix[-1] + depths[i] )

n = len(depths)

max_x =0

for x in range(0, min(k, n)+1):

    if x ==0:

        cost =0

    else:

        cost = x * depths[x-1] - prefix[x]

    if cost <=p and x <=k:

        if x > max_x:

            max_x =x

So max_x is the answer.

But why is the answer the maximum x, which is the count of nodes selected, which is the same as the maximum w_i?

Yes, because all x nodes are assigned to arrive at the same t, which is the maximum depth in the group. So in that step t, the root's water is x.

Thus, the answer is the maximum x possible.

So the code should output max_x.

But wait, in the first sample, the answer is 2. Which is the maximum x=2.

Yes. So the code is correct.

But let's think about a case where the sum can allow a larger x by choosing a larger t.

For example:

Suppose we have two nodes with depth 1 and 1.

k=2, p=2.

sum for x=2: 2*1 - (1+1) = 2-2=0 <=p. So x=2 is allowed.

If we set t=2, then sum is 2*2 - (1+1) =4-2=2 <=p. So we can also take x=2 here, and the answer is 2. So same result.

But the code allows x=2 because the sum is 0, which is <=p.

But in this case, the sum when x=2 and t=2 is 2, which is allowed, but the code's approach uses the minimal sum (0) which is allowed.

So the code allows x=2 and returns 2, which is correct.

Thus, the code's approach of using the minimal possible sum (t=d_x) is sufficient to find the maximum x.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, code implementation:

Read m, k, p.

Build adjacency list.

Compute depths via BFS.

Sort the depths.

Compute prefix sums.

Iterate x and find the maximum x.

Now, code:

But in Python, for BFS, we can use deque.

The code:

import sys
from collections import deque

m, k, p = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

adj = [[] for _ in range(m+1)]
for _ in range(m-1):
    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)

# Compute depths via BFS
depth = [ -1 ] * (m+1)
q = deque()
q.append(1)
depth[1] =0
while q:
    u = q.popleft()
    for v in adj[u]:
        if depth[v] == -1:
            depth[v] = depth[u] +1
            q.append(v)

# Collect non-root nodes' depths
depths = []
for i in range(2, m+1):
    if depth[i] != -1:
        depths.append(depth[i])

depths.sort()

prefix = [0]
for d in depths:
    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + d)

n = len(depths)
max_x =0
max_possible_x = min(k, n)

for x in range(0, max_possible_x +1):
    if x ==0:
        cost =0
    else:
        current_d = depths[x-1]
        cost = x * current_d - prefix[x]
    if cost <= p and x <=k:
        if x > max_x:
            max_x =x

print(max_x)

Testing this against the sample inputs:

Sample 1:

depths after sorting are [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].

prefix sum: [0,1,2,4,6,9,12,16,20,24]

max_possible_x is min(2,9) =2.

x=0: cost 0, allowed. max_x=0.

x=1: cost 1*1 -1 =0 <=1. x=1 is allowed. max_x=1.

x=2: cost 2*1 -2=0 <=1. allowed. max_x=2.

So output is 2.

Sample 2:

depths sorted [1,1,2,2].

prefix sum [0,1,2,4,6].

max_possible_x is min(1000,4) =4.

x=4: cost 4*2 -6=8-6=2 <=1000. allowed. max_x=4.

So output is 4.

Thus, the code works.

Another test case: when k=0, then output is 0.

When p=0, then only x=0 is allowed, so output 0.

Thus, the code handles all cases.
