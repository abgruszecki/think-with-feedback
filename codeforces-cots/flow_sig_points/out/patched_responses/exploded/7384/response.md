<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where Vasya wants to build a house in his garden, and we have to find the minimum number of trees to chop. Let's see the problem statement again.

The garden is an n x m grid. Each cell is 0 or 1 (tree or not). The house is a rectangle of size a x b, but can be rotated (so a and b can be swapped). We need to find the minimum trees in such a rectangle placed anywhere in the garden.

Hmm. So first, I need to check both possible orientations of the rectangle: a x b and b x a. Then, for each possible position of the rectangle in the garden, calculate how many trees are inside. The answer is the minimum among all these possibilities.

Wait, but how do I handle the rotation? Like, if the rectangle is a x b, then we need to check if the dimensions fit in the garden. For example, if a <= n and b <= m, then possible. Otherwise, maybe the rotated version (b x a) is possible if b <=n and a <=m. Or maybe not. But the problem says it's guaranteed that at least one orientation is possible. So for each possible orientation (a x b and b x a), check if the dimensions are allowed (i.e., the rectangle's height and width fit into the garden's n and m), and then consider all possible positions for that rectangle.

So first, I need to generate all possible rectangles of both possible dimensions. For each such possible dimension (like height h and width w), we check if h <=n and w <=m. If yes, then proceed to check all possible top-left positions of the rectangle in the garden. For each such rectangle, count the number of 1s inside, and track the minimum.

So the steps are:

1. Generate all possible valid rectangle dimensions (either a x b or b x a, but whichever fits into n x m).
2. For each valid dimension (h, w), iterate over all possible starting positions (i, j) such that the rectangle starts at (i, j) and spans h rows and w columns.
3. For each such rectangle, compute the sum of 1s in that rectangle.
4. Keep the minimum sum among all possible rectangles.

Now, how to compute the sum efficiently? Since the grid can be up to 50x50, which is 2500 cells. For each possible rectangle (which could be O(50*50) positions and two possible dimensions), the total number of rectangles is manageable. For each rectangle, calculating the sum by iterating through all cells in the rectangle would be O(a*b) per rectangle. Since a and b can be up to 50, each rectangle check is O(2500) operations. But for 50x50 positions and two possible dimensions, that's 50*50*2 * 2500 = 12,500,000 operations. Hmm, that's 12 million operations. Wait, but 50x50 is 2500 positions, and each rectangle has a size up to 50x50. So the worst case for one dimension is 50x50 positions * 50x50 cells = 6,250,000 per dimension. Two dimensions would be 12.5 million. But considering that in practice, the a and b may be smaller, but 12 million is manageable for Python within 2 seconds. So perhaps this brute-force approach is acceptable.

Alternatively, using a prefix sum matrix can help calculate the sum in O(1) per rectangle, which would make the solution much faster. Let's think about that.

Yes, the prefix sum approach would precompute a 2D array where prefix[i][j] is the sum of all cells from (0,0) to (i,j). Then, the sum of a rectangle from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is computed using the inclusion-exclusion principle. This would reduce the sum calculation to O(1) per rectangle.

So first, build the prefix sum matrix. Then for each possible rectangle (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), compute the sum in O(1) time.

So the plan is:

- Precompute the prefix sum array.
- For each possible orientation (h and w being a and b or swapped), check if h <=n and w <=m.
   For each valid orientation:
      Iterate over all possible top-left positions (i, j) such that the rectangle is of size h x w.
      The rectangle covers rows i to i + h -1 (assuming 0-based?), and columns j to j + w -1. Wait, need to check indices.

Wait, for example, if the top-left corner is (i, j) and the rectangle has height h and width w, then the bottom-right corner is (i + h -1, j + w -1). So we need to ensure that i + h -1 < n and j + w -1 < m. So the starting positions i can be from 0 to (n - h) inclusive. Similarly for j.

So for each possible orientation (h, w):

   For h in possible heights (a or b, depending on which orientation fits):
      If h >n or w >m, skip this orientation.
      Else:
          For each possible i from 0 to n - h:
              For each possible j from 0 to m - w:
                  Compute the sum of the rectangle starting at (i,j) with size h x w.
                  Update the minimum sum if needed.

So building the prefix sum first is essential for efficiency.

So steps:

1. Read n, m.
2. Read the grid (n rows, m columns).
3. Read a, b.
4. Generate possible (h, w) pairs: (a, b), (b, a). Check which ones fit into n and m. For example, if a >n and b >m, then maybe the other orientation is possible. The problem says that at least one is possible.
5. Compute the prefix sum matrix.
6. For each valid (h, w) in possible orientations:
   For each possible top-left (i, j) such that the rectangle of size h x w fits into the grid:
      Compute the sum of the rectangle using prefix sum.
      Keep track of the minimum sum.
7. Output the minimum sum found.

Now, the prefix sum computation.

How to compute the prefix sum:

We can compute a 2D array where prefix[i][j] is the sum of the rectangle from (0,0) to (i-1, j-1). So for the grid 0-based.

The formula for prefix sum is:

prefix[i][j] = grid[i-1][j-1] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1]

Then, the sum for a rectangle from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) (inclusive) is:

sum = prefix[x2+1][y2+1] - prefix[x1][y2+1] - prefix[x2+1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1]

Wait, need to check. Let's think in terms of 0-based grid indices. For example, the rectangle starting at (x1, y1) and ending at (x2, y2) (inclusive) would have a sum computed as:

sum = prefix[x2+1][y2+1] - prefix[x1][y2+1] - prefix[x2+1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1]

Yes. Because the prefix matrix is 1-based. So the initial setup would have prefix[0][...] and prefix[...][0] as zero.

So, in code:

We'll read the grid as a 2D list. Then create a prefix matrix of (n+1) rows and (m+1) columns, initialized to 0.

Then for each i from 1 to n:
   for each j from 1 to m:
       prefix[i][j] = grid[i-1][j-1] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1]

Yes. Then, for the rectangle from (x1, y1) to x2, y2, the sum is:

sum = prefix[x2+1][y2+1] - prefix[x1][y2+1] - prefix[x2+1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1]

Wait, but in the problem, the rectangle's size is h (height) and w (width). So if the top-left corner is (i, j), then the bottom-right is (i + h -1, j + w -1), since h is the number of rows. So x1 = i, y1 = j, x2 = i + h -1, y2 = j + w -1.

So for example, if h is 2 and i is 0, then x2 is 1.

So in code:

for each possible (h, w) in the valid orientations:
    for i in 0 ... (n - h):
        x1 = i
        x2 = i + h - 1
        for j in 0 ... (m - w):
            y1 = j
            y2 = j + w -1
            current_sum = prefix[x2+1][y2+1] - prefix[x1][y2+1] - prefix[x2+1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1]
            if current_sum < current_min:
                update current_min

So that's the plan.

Now, code steps:

Read n and m.

Read n lines, each line has m numbers (0 or 1). So for example, in Python, read each line as a list of integers.

Then read a and b.

Possible orientations: (a, b) and (b, a). But we need to check which of these are possible.

But how? For example, if the garden is 3x4, and a=5, b=2, then (a, b) is 5x2 which is 5 rows (but n is 3), so not possible. But the other orientation (2,5) would have 2 rows (which is <=3) and 5 columns (but m is 4). So also not possible. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that at least one is possible. So for the code, we can generate both possible orientations, and for each check if h (number of rows required) <=n and w (number of columns required) <=m. If so, include that orientation.

So in code:

possible_orientations = []
if a <=n and b <=m:
    possible_orientations.append( (a, b) )
if b <=n and a <=m:
    possible_orientations.append( (b, a) )

Wait, wait. Because (a, b) orientation requires that the height is a and width is b. So the number of rows is a, and columns is b. So a must be <=n and b <=m. Similarly, the other orientation (rotated) is (b, a), so the height is b and width is a, which requires b <=n and a <=m.

So for example, if the original a is 2 and b is 3, and the garden is 4x5. Then (2,3) would require 2 rows and 3 columns, which is allowed. The other orientation is (3,2), which requires 3 rows (<=4) and 2 columns (<=5), which is also allowed.

So the code needs to check both possibilities, and add them to the list of possible orientations if they fit.

So, after generating possible_orientations, we can loop through each (h, w) in that list.

Then, for each (h, w), loop through all possible starting i and j.

Now, code in Python.

Edge cases:

For example, in the first sample input:

2 2

1 0

1 1

a and b are 1 and 1. So possible orientations are (1,1) and (1,1) (same as each other). So in the possible_orientations list, it's only added once. But even if added twice, it's okay. But since both h and w are 1, the code would check all 1x1 positions. But the minimum is 0.

Wait, the first sample's input is:

n=2, m=2.

grid is:

1 0

1 1

a=1, b=1. So possible orientations are (1,1) (since 1 <=2 and 1 <=2). So the code checks all possible 1x1 rectangles (each cell). The minimum is 0, which is achieved in cell (0,0) (assuming 0-based) which has 1, but wait, no. Wait, the first sample's output is 0. Let me look again.

Wait the first sample's input is:

2 2

1 0

1 1

So the grid is:

Row 0: 1 0

Row 1: 1 1

The a and b are 1 1. So the house is 1x1. So any cell can be chosen. The minimum number of trees (which are 1's) in any 1x1 cell is 0, which occurs at cell (0,1), which has 0. So the answer is 0.

So code would check all cells, find the minimum sum (0) and output that.

So the code correctly handles that.

Another example is the second sample, which requires the code to check both possible orientations. Let's see:

Sample input 2:

4 5

0 0 1 0 1

0 1 1 1 0

1 0 1 0 1

1 1 1 1 1

a and b are 2 and 3. So possible orientations are (2,3) and (3,2).

Check if 2 <=4 and 3 <=5: yes. So (2,3) is allowed. Also, check (3,2): 3 <=4 and 2 <=5: yes. So both are allowed.

So code will check both.

So for all possible 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles.

In that example, the minimum is 2. The code would find that.

Now, coding steps:

Read n, m.

Read n lines, each line split into integers. Then build the grid.

Compute prefix sum.

Then, for each possible orientation (h, w):

   if h >n or w>m: skip.

   else:

       for i in 0 ... (n - h):

           x1 = i

           x2 = i + h -1

           for j in 0 ... (m -w):

               y1 = j

               y2 = j + w -1

               compute sum as per prefix.

               track the min sum.

Now, code:

Implementing the prefix sum:

In Python, the grid is a list of lists. So for example, grid = [[0,0,1,0,1], [0,1,1,1,0], ...].

The prefix array is of size (n+1) x (m+1), initialized to 0.

Then for i in 1 to n:

   for j in 1 to m:

       prefix[i][j] = grid[i-1][j-1] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1]

Once that's done, compute the sum as described.

Now, code for possible_orientations:

possible = []
if a <=n and b <=m:
    possible.append( (a, b) )
if b <=n and a <=m and (b, a) not in possible:  # avoid duplicates if a and b are same
    possible.append( (b, a) )

But wait, for example, if a and b are equal, then (a, b) and (b, a) are the same. So we should check if they are already in the list before adding. But in code, when a and b are equal, the first check adds (a, b) to possible. The second check (b <=n and a <=m) is the same as (a <=n and b <=m), so the same condition. So for example, if a and b are 2, and n=3, m=3, then possible would add (2,2) once. Then the second check would check if 2 <=n (3) and 2 <=m (3), which is true. But (2,2) is already in possible. So we need to avoid adding duplicates. Because for a=2, b=2, adding (2,2) once is enough. Otherwise, the code would process the same (h, w) twice, leading to redundant work.

So to avoid duplicates, perhaps check if the current (h, w) is already in possible_orientations. But since a and b can be same, the code may add the same (h, w) twice. So the code should first check both possibilities, but only add each unique (h, w) once.

Alternatively, generate all possible orientations, but check if they fit, and add to a set to avoid duplicates.

So code:

orientations = set()
h1, w1 = a, b
if h1 <=n and w1 <=m:
    orientations.add( (h1, w1) )
h2, w2 = b, a
if h2 <=n and w2 <=m:
    orientations.add( (h2, w2) )

possible_orientations = list(orientations)

But in Python, sets can be used to avoid duplicates.

Yes. So this way, even if a==b and (a, b) and (b,a) are same, they will be added once.

So code for possible_orientations is:

possible = set()
if a <= n and b <= m:
    possible.add( (a, b) )
if b <= n and a <= m:
    possible.add( (b, a) )

possible = list(possible)

Then, for each (h, w) in possible, process.

So that's covered.

Now, code for reading the grid.

In Python:

n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    grid.append(row)
a, b = map(int, input().split())

Then compute the prefix sum:

prefix = [[0]*(m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(1, m+1):
        prefix[i][j] = grid[i-1][j-1] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1]

Then, iterate over possible orientations:

min_trees = float('inf')

for h, w in possible_orientations:
    # Check if the rectangle can fit
    if h > n or w > m:
        continue  # should not happen since possible_orientations are already filtered
    # Iterate through all possible top-left positions
    for i in range(n - h + 1):
        for j in range(m - w + 1):
            x1 = i
            y1 = j
            x2 = i + h - 1
            y2 = j + w - 1
            # compute sum using prefix sum
            current = prefix[x2+1][y2+1] - prefix[x1][y2+1] - prefix[x2+1][y1] + prefix[x1][y1]
            if current < min_trees:
                min_trees = current

print(min_trees)

But wait, in the code, the ranges for i and j: For i, it's from 0 to (n - h) inclusive. Because i can be 0, and h rows starting at 0 would end at h-1, which is <=n-1. For example, if h=2 and n=3, then i can be 0 or 1 (0 <= i <= 3-2 =1). So in code, range(n - h +1) gives the correct number of possibilities. Because n - h +1 is the count of possible i's.

Yes.

So the code should handle that.

Testing the first sample:

Sample input 1:

2 2

1 0

1 1

1 1

Possible orientations are (1,1). So h=1, w=1.

n=2, m=2.

For i in 0 to 2-1 =1:

j in 0 to 2-1=1.

Each cell is 1x1. The sum for cell (0,0) is 1. (0,1) is 0. (1,0) is 1. (1,1) is 1.

So the minimum is 0.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Sample input 2:

4 5

0 0 1 0 1

0 1 1 1 0

1 0 1 0 1

1 1 1 1 1

2 3

Possible orientations: (2,3) and (3,2).

Check if 2<=4 and 3<=5: yes. (3,2) requires 3<=4 and 2<=5: yes. So both are added.

So code will check rectangles of size 2x3 and 3x2.

Let's see for 3x2:

h=3, w=2. So the rectangle is 3 rows high, 2 columns wide.

The garden is 4 rows (0-3), 5 columns (0-4). So for i in 0 to 4-3=1 (since 4 rows, 3 rows, possible i is 0 and 1). For j in 0 to 5-2=3 (0,1,2,3).

For each of these positions, compute sum.

But according to the note, the optimal rectangle is 3x2 (since the upper left is (1-1,1-1) = (0,0) and lower right is (3,2) which is rows 0-2 (h=3?), columns 0-1 (w=2). Wait the note says upper left is (1,1) in 1-based, which is (0,0) in 0-based. Lower right is (3,2) which is row 3-1=2 (since in 0-based?), wait, I need to think.

Wait the note says the upper left is (1,1) and lower right is (3,2) in the sample. So in 0-based indices, that's (0,0) upper left, and (2,1) lower right. So the rectangle is 3 rows (0-2) and 2 columns (0-1). Which is a 3x2 rectangle. So sum of trees (1s) in that area.

The grid for that area is:

Row 0 (original first line): 0 0 1 0 1 → but the columns are 0 and 1: 0 and 0.

Row 1: 0 1 1 1 0 → columns 0 and 1: 0 and 1.

Row 2: 1 0 1 0 1 → columns 0 and 1: 1 and 0.

So sum is 0+0 +0+1 +1+0 = 1+1=2? Wait no: sum of all cells in the 3x2 rectangle (rows 0-2, columns 0-1):

Row 0: 0,0 → sum 0.

Row 1: 0,1 → sum 1.

Row 2: 1,0 → sum 1.

Total 0+1+1 = 2. Which matches the sample's output of 2.

So the code would find this sum.

So code would correctly compute this.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, code in Python:

Let's put it all together.
