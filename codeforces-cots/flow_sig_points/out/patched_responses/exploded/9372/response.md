<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to find the number of distinct configurations possible after any number of attacks, including zero. The attacks can happen in any order, but each attack changes the configuration based on the rules given.

Hmm. Let's start by understanding the attack process. Each attack is when a colony attacks an adjacent one, and the attacked one becomes the same as the attacker. So, the problem is to model all possible sequences of these attacks and track the different possible end states.

But wait, the problem is asking for the total number of possible distinct configurations after any number of attacks. Since the number could be huge, especially when n is up to 5000, we need an efficient way to calculate this without simulating all possibilities.

Let's think about the possible states. For each position in the test tube, what determines its possible color in the end? Maybe each position's color is determined by the earliest possible attacker that can reach it. Or maybe it's determined by the strongest (in terms of reach) color that can influence it.

Wait, perhaps this is a dynamic programming problem. Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem as intervals where each interval is a run of the same character, and track how those intervals can merge or expand.

Another angle: consider that a colony can propagate its color to adjacent regions through attacks. So, for a region i, all regions that can reach i via a chain of attacks (where each attack allows the color to spread) would influence what color i can become. But wait, the direction of attacks matters. For example, if a colony to the left attacks to the right, then the right colony's color changes. But then, the new colony (now same as left) could attack further right, etc.

But maybe each position's final color depends on the earliest possible color that can reach it from either the left or right. Wait, perhaps not. Because attacks can happen in any order. So, for a position, the color could be determined by any of the possible sources that can reach it through the allowed attack steps.

Alternatively, think of the problem as each character in the initial string can spread as far as possible. For example, if there's a run of 'a's followed by a 'b' followed by a 'c', then 'a' can spread to the right, 'b' can spread left or right (but in this case, maybe after 'a' spreads to 'b', then the 'a' can take over the 'c' as well). But this depends on the order of attacks.

Wait, but the order of attacks might not matter for the final configuration. For example, if two adjacent regions are 'a' and 'b', then the final configuration can be either 'aa' or 'bb' depending on which attack happens. But if there are multiple regions, maybe the possible configurations are determined by the leftmost and rightmost positions of each character, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the key observation is that the final configuration is determined by the set of positions where each position's color is the same as one of the original colors in some interval that can dominate that position through attacks.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming where we track intervals and the possible colors they can take. For example, for each interval [i, j], we can track the possible colors that the entire interval can have. Then, merging adjacent intervals if possible.

But how to model this. Let's think of the problem as each character in the original string can form a segment. Each time, when a segment attacks an adjacent segment, it can merge them. For example, if you have segments like a | b | a, then the middle b can attack either left or right. But once it attacks left, the left a and b become a (if a attacks b) or b (if b attacks a). Wait, no. Wait, when a colony attacks, the attacked colony becomes the same as the attacker. So, for example, if the initial is a b a:

If a attacks the b (left to right), then the b becomes a. Now, the entire left two are a's. Then, the middle a can attack the right a, but that doesn't change anything. So the final state is aaa.

But if the middle b attacks the right a first, then the right a becomes b, resulting in a bb. Then, the left a can attack the middle b, turning it into a, resulting in aab. Then the middle a can attack the right b, resulting in aaa. So in this case, the final state is aaa regardless of the order.

Wait, but this might not be the case. Let's take another example. Suppose the initial is ab. Then, possible attacks are 1→2 (resulting in aa) or 2→1 (resulting in bb). So the final possible configurations are ab (no attacks), aa, and bb. So in this case, the order of attacks doesn't affect the outcome once all possible attacks are done. Wait, but since in this case, after one attack, there are no more possible attacks. So the possible end states are three possibilities.

But in the example with 'ab', the answer is 3. So the key is that even after some attacks, there may be multiple possibilities. But how can we model all possible end states?

Another approach: the final configuration is determined by the possible "dominant" characters. For example, in the initial string, each character can potentially take over adjacent regions. The final state would be determined by which characters have been able to take over regions through a series of attacks.

But how can we model this? Let's think about each position in the string. For a position i, what possible characters can it have in the final configuration?

The possible characters for position i must be the same as the original character of some position j, and there exists a path of positions between j and i such that each step in the path allows j's character to propagate to i. For example, if j is to the left of i, then all positions from j to i must have characters that can be replaced by j's character through a chain of attacks.

Wait, maybe each position's possible character is the original character of some position j, and j can reach i via a path where every step is towards i. For example, j is to the left of i. Then, for each position k between j and i, j's character can attack to the right, replacing k's character, then the next one, and so on until i. Similarly, if j is to the right of i, then j's character can attack leftwards.

Alternatively, think of each position i can have a color that is either the original color of some position j where j is in the interval [L, R], and L is the leftmost position that can reach i, and R is the rightmost position that can reach i. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the problem resembles the problem of interval merging where each interval can expand to the left or right. For example, a segment of 'a's can expand to the left or right if the adjacent segment can be conquered. The final state is when all possible expansions are considered.

But how do we model all possible expansions? For example, the initial string is a sequence of segments (like runs of the same character). When a segment attacks an adjacent segment, it merges with it. For example, if we have segments S1 and S2, and S1 attacks S2, the merged segment becomes S1's character. So the segments are merged into one.

But how can this process be modeled to count all possible final configurations?

Wait, perhaps the final configuration is determined by the set of positions where each segment is a run of the same character, and the runs are formed by merging adjacent segments through attacks. Each such run can be any union of original segments, but the order of merging affects the possible characters.

Alternatively, each run in the final configuration must consist of a subset of the original segments, and the character of the run is determined by the original character of some segment in the run.

But how to model this. Let's think of the problem as a dynamic programming problem where we track possible intervals and their characters.

For example, let's model dp[i][j][c] as true if the interval [i, j] can be made to have the character c. Then, for each interval, we can merge adjacent intervals if their characters can be merged via attacks.

But this approach might have a time complexity of O(n^3 * 26), which is way too slow for n=5000.

Hmm. So this approach isn't feasible. Need a better way.

Wait, maybe the key insight is that the final configuration is determined by the positions where each position's color is the same as one of the original colors in some interval that can "dominate" it. So for each position, the possible colors are those of the original characters that can reach it through a chain of attacks.

But how do the attacks propagate? For example, suppose we have the initial string as "abacaba". Let's consider position 4 (0-based or 1-based?), which is 'c'. What possible colors can this position take?

If the 'c' is attacked from the left or right. For example, if the 'b' (position 2) attacks to the right into 'a', then that 'a' becomes 'b'. Then the 'c' can be attacked by the 'a' (position 5) on the right? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the 'c' can be attacked by its adjacent positions. So, if the 'b' (position 2) attacks to the right, the 'a' (position 3) becomes 'b'. Then, the 'b' (position 3) can attack the 'c' (position 4) to the right, turning it into 'b'. Then, the 'c' (now 'b') can attack the next 'a' (position 5), turning it into 'b', etc. So in this case, position 4's color can become 'b'.

Alternatively, if the 'c' attacks left into the 'a' (position 3), then that 'a' becomes 'c'. Then, the 'c' (position 3) can attack the 'b' (position 2), turning it into 'c', etc. So position 4's color can remain 'c' in this case.

But how do we model all possibilities where the final color can be any of the original characters in some interval, perhaps expanding through attacks.

Another observation: each attack can only propagate a character to an adjacent position. So the final color of a position i must be the same as some position j in the original string, and there exists a path from j to i where each step is either left or right, and all the positions along the path were originally j's character or have been taken over by j's character through attacks.

Wait, maybe for a position i, the possible characters it can have are the characters from the original string in some interval that includes i. For example, if there's a segment of 'a's in the original string that can expand to cover i through a series of attacks.

Alternatively, the possible characters for position i are the characters of the original string that are in some interval [L, R] containing i. But how to determine which intervals can be formed through attacks.

Another idea: the problem is similar to the problem of determining for each position the set of possible characters that can dominate it after any number of possible attacks. Then, the total number of possible configurations is the product of the number of possible choices for each position, but with the constraint that adjacent positions must have compatible choices (since attacks can merge regions).

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the choices for positions are not independent. For example, if position i can be 'a' or 'b', and position i+1 can be 'a' or 'c', the final configuration must form runs of the same character. So for positions i and i+1 to be different, there must be a way that they were not merged through attacks. But how?

Alternatively, think of the final configuration as a set of runs where each run is a group of consecutive positions with the same character, and each run's character is present in the original string. Then, the total number of possible configurations is the number of ways to split the string into runs, where each run's character is present in the corresponding segment of the original string, and the runs can be formed by merging adjacent segments through attacks.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for a run in the final configuration, the character must be the same as one of the original characters in the interval covered by the run. Moreover, the run must be a union of some original segments, merged via attacks. For example, the run could have started as a single character and then expanded by attacking adjacent segments.

Wait, perhaps each possible final run can be represented as a set of intervals in the original string where the run's character appears. For example, if a final run is 'a', then there must be at least one 'a' in the original string's positions covered by the run. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps for a final run of character c covering positions [i, j], there must be at least one position k in [i, j] in the original string where s[k] = c. Otherwise, it's impossible to have a run of c in that interval.

But how can that be? Because if there's no original c in [i, j], then how could the attacks have propagated c to that interval. For example, the initial string has no 'c's, then the final configuration can't have 'c's. So each run in the final configuration must have a character that was present in the original string in that run's interval.

So the first step is to realize that each character in the final configuration must be present in the original string's corresponding run's interval.

Thus, the problem reduces to partitioning the original string into intervals (runs) such that each interval's character in the final configuration is present in the original string's interval, and the intervals are formed by merging adjacent segments through attacks.

Then, the total number of possible configurations is the product over all possible partitions into such intervals, multiplied by the choices of characters for each interval (which must be present in their interval in the original string).

But how to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem where dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i characters. Then, for each j < i, we can consider extending the configuration by adding a new run from j+1 to i, where the character of this run must be present in the original substring from j+1 to i.

But even this approach has O(n^2) time complexity, which may be manageable for n=5000.

Let's think. For example, for each i, we can compute dp[i] by considering all possible j where the last run starts at j+1 and ends at i. For each j, we check if there exists a character c in s[j+1..i]. Then, for each such j, dp[i] += dp[j] * the number of possible c's in s[j+1..i].

But wait, for each possible j, the number of possible c's is equal to the number of distinct characters present in s[j+1..i]. So for each j, we need to find the count of distinct characters in s[j+1..i]. Then, dp[i] is the sum over all j < i of dp[j] * count[j+1..i].

But if we precompute for all intervals [a..b] the number of distinct characters, then we can use dynamic programming with this information.

But for n=5000, precomputing all intervals would take O(n^2) time and space, which is 25 million. That's manageable in terms of time, but space might be an issue. For example, 25 million integers would take about 100MB (if each is 4 bytes), which is manageable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the number of possible c's for each interval [j+1..i] as we process the dynamic programming.

Alternatively, for each i, we can track for each possible j < i the set of distinct characters in s[j+1..i]. But that's not feasible for n=5000.

Hmm. Let's think again. The dynamic programming approach would be:

Initialize dp[0] = 1 (the empty prefix).

For each i from 1 to n:

   dp[i] = sum over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] * k), where k is the number of distinct characters in s[j+1..i}.

But this is O(n^2) time and O(n) space. Wait, for n=5e3, O(n^2) is 25 million operations. That's manageable within Python's time constraints for 2 seconds, but maybe not. For example, each iteration of the inner loop would have to compute the number of distinct characters in the substring s[j+1..i} for each j < i. But that's O(n^2) time.

Wait, but if we compute for each i, the distinct characters in s[0..i], s[1..i], etc., it would take O(n^2) time, which is 25 million for n=5e3. But that's not feasible for Python. So maybe we need a way to compute the number of distinct characters in a sliding window.

Alternatively, for each i, we can track the last occurrence of each character. Then, for the substring [j+1..i], the number of distinct characters is the number of characters whose last occurrence is >= j+1.

Wait, perhaps for each i, we can keep track of the positions where each character last occurred. Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, the number of distinct characters in s[j+1..i} can be found by counting how many characters have their last occurrence in [j+1..i}.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternative approach:

For each i, as we process it, we can track a bitmask (or a frequency array) of the characters from j+1 to i. Then, for each j, we can compute the number of distinct characters.

But even this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for Python.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to precompute for each position i, the earliest j where a certain character is present. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem differently. The key is that each possible run in the final configuration must consist of a substring where at least one character in that substring is the same as the run's character.

Thus, for the dynamic programming approach:

At each step i, for each possible j, the last run is [j+1..i], and the number of possible choices for the character of this run is the number of distinct characters in [j+1..i}.

So, the DP recurrence is:

dp[i] = sum_{j=0 to i-1} (dp[j] * cnt[j+1..i})

where cnt[j+1..i] is the number of distinct characters in s[j+1..i}.

But to compute this efficiently, we need a way to compute cnt[j+1..i} for all j in O(1) or O(26) per j.

Hmm. Here's an idea: for each i, we can keep track of the last occurrence of each character. Then, for j in [0, i-1], the count of distinct characters in [j+1..i} is the number of characters whose last occurrence in the entire string up to i is >= j+1.

So, for each position i, we can precompute for each character c the last occurrence before or at i. Then, for a given j, the count is the number of characters c where the last occurrence of c in [0..i} is >= j+1.

But how to compute this for all j efficiently.

Alternatively, for each i, as we process it, we can track for each character c the last position where c appeared. Then, for each j from 0 to i-1, the count of distinct characters in [j+1..i} is equal to the number of characters c where their last occurrence in the entire string up to i is in [j+1..i}.

So, for a fixed i, the set of characters in [j+1..i} is the set of characters c where the last occurrence of c is >= j+1 and <=i.

So, the count is the number of such c.

To compute this count for all j, perhaps we can precompute for each i the last occurrence positions of each character, and then for each j, compute the count.

But this is still O(n^2) time. So for n=5e3, this would be 25 million operations, which might be manageable in C++ but not in Python.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of it for each i:

We can track, for each character, the positions where it occurs up to i.

For each j, the characters present in [j+1..i] are those that have at least one occurrence in that interval.

So, for each character c, the earliest occurrence after j is the first occurrence in [j+1..i}. If such an occurrence exists, then c is in the substring.

But how to find, for each j, the number of characters c that have at least one occurrence in [j+1..i}.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each i and j, the count. But again, this is O(n^2), which is 25 million for n=5e3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this with some inclusion-exclusion. For example, for the current i, as we process it, we can track the last occurrence of each character. Then, for j+1, we can compute how many characters have their last occurrence >= j+1.

But how?

Let me think. Suppose for each character c, we have an array last_pos[c], which is the last position (up to i) where c appeared. Then, for each j, the count is the number of c in the alphabet where last_pos[c] >= j+1 and <=i.

But how to compute this for all j from 0 to i-1.

Wait, for a given i, j can range from 0 to i-1. For each j, the interval [j+1, i] is of varying length. The count is the number of characters present in that interval.

Let me think of it for all possible j. For each character c, the earliest j where c is present in [j+1..i} is j+1 <= last_pos[c]. So j can be up to last_pos[c] -1. For j >= last_pos[c], c is not present in [j+1..i}.

So for character c, all j where j+1 <= last_pos[c] (i.e., j <= last_pos[c] -1) will have c in their interval [j+1..i}.

So, for each character c, the contribution to the count is 1 for all j <= last_pos[c] -1. But how to accumulate this across all characters.

Hmm. So for each character c, the range of j where j <= last_pos[c] -1 is [0, last_pos[c] -1]. So for each j in this range, the count increases by 1.

But since the count is the sum over all c of 1 if j is in [0, last_pos[c]-1], else 0.

So for a given i, the count for j is the number of c where j <= last_pos[c] -1.

But how to compute the sum over j of dp[j] multiplied by the count of c where j <= last_pos[c] -1.

Wait, maybe we can reverse the order. For each c, find all j where j <= last_pos[c] -1, and sum dp[j] for those j. Then, the total sum for all c is the sum over c of the sum of dp[j] for j <= last_pos[c] -1.

But this would require, for each c, to compute the prefix sum up to last_pos[c] -1, which can be done if we have a prefix sum array.

Yes! So here's the plan:

We can precompute the prefix sums of the dp array. Let's define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of dp[0..i].

Then, for each i, when processing the i-th character, we can:

1. For each character c in the current character's interval (from j+1 to i), find the last occurrence of c up to i. Let last_pos[c] be that position.

2. For each c, the contribution to the sum for dp[i] is the sum of dp[j] where j <= last_pos[c] -1. This is equivalent to prefix_sum[last_pos[c] -1].

But wait, the sum for dp[i] is the sum over j < i of (dp[j] * cnt[j+1..i}).

But cnt[j+1..i} is the number of c's such that their last occurrence up to i is >= j+1.

So, for each j, the cnt is the number of c's where last_pos[c] >= j+1.

But for each c, the j's that are <= last_pos[c] -1 are the ones that have j+1 <= last_pos[c], so their interval includes c.

Thus, the sum over j < i of dp[j] * cnt[j+1..i} is equal to the sum over c of (sum of dp[j] where j <= last_pos[c] -1).

So for each i, the value of dp[i] is the sum over all characters c of the prefix sum up to last_pos[c] -1 (if last_pos[c] is >= 1, since j can be 0 to i-1).

So the steps would be:

- Initialize dp[0] = 1 (the empty prefix).
- Compute prefix_sum as a cumulative sum array.
- For each i from 1 to n:
   - For the current character s[i-1] (assuming 0-based), update the last occurrence of that character to i.
   - For each character c in 'a' to 'z', find last_pos[c].
   - Compute the sum for dp[i] as the sum over all c of (prefix_sum up to last_pos[c] -1) if last_pos[c] >= 1.
   - Then, compute prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + dp[i]

This approach would have a time complexity of O(n * 26), which is 5e3 * 26 = 130,000 operations, which is manageable.

Wait, that's a brilliant insight! Let me rephrase:

Each time we process the i-th character (assuming the input is 0-based for the string), we can track the last occurrence of each character. Then, for the current i, the value of dp[i] is the sum over all characters c of the sum of dp[j] for j up to last_pos[c] - 1. Because for each c, all j's up to last_pos[c] -1 would include c in their interval [j+1..i], so their count for the interval [j+1..i} would include c. Summing over all c gives the total count for each j.

But wait, this might overcount. Because for a particular j, the interval [j+1..i} may have multiple characters. So the count is the number of characters present in that interval. But summing over all c the sum of j <= last_pos[c]-1 would count the number of characters present in the interval [j+1..i} for each j, but each j is counted once for each c present in [j+1..i}. So this is exactly what we need.

For example, if for j=0, the interval [1..i} contains characters 'a' and 'b', then for each of these characters c, j=0 is <= last_pos[c]-1 (assuming last_pos[c] >=1). So summing the sum for each c gives 2, which is the count for that j.

So the approach is correct.

Now, how to implement this.

First, we need to track for each character c, the last position where it occurred (up to the current i). For each i, we process the current character (s[i-1], since the input is 1-based in the problem's examples?), but assuming the string is 0-based in our code.

Wait, the input is given as a string of length n. Let's say in the code, we have s = input().strip(), and for each i in 0..n-1, s[i] is the character at position i+1 in the problem's description. Because the problem says the first line is n, and the second line is a string of n characters.

So in code, the initial string is s, with s[0] being the first region, s[1] the second, etc.

Now, for each i from 1 to n (processing the first i characters of the string?), wait, the DP approach is to process the first i characters. For example, when i=1, the first character, and so on.

Wait, the code's DP array is 1-based? Or 0-based?

Hmm. Let's clarify. Let's have dp[i] be the number of ways to form the first i characters of the string (s[0..i-1]). So, dp[0] = 1 (empty string), dp[1] is the number of ways to form the first character, etc.

So for the i-th step (processing the first i characters), the current character is s[i-1].

So, for each step i (from 1 to n), we need to compute dp[i] based on all possible j < i, where the last run is from j to i-1 (but wait, no, j is the previous step, then the run is j+1 to i? Or maybe j is the index in the DP array.

Hmm, perhaps the code should be:

dp[0] = 1 (the empty prefix)
for i in 1..n:
   dp[i] = sum over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] * cnt[j+1..i-1] )
But in this case, j+1 to i-1 is the interval of the new run. So the substring s[j..i-1] is the run.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let's try to model it properly.

Suppose we are processing the i-th character (s[i-1] in 0-based). The DP state is dp[i], which represents the number of configurations for the first i characters.

To compute dp[i], we need to consider all possible j < i, where the last run in the configuration is from j to i-1. The character of this run must be one of the characters present in s[j..i-1}.

The number of possible characters for this run is the number of distinct characters in s[j..i-1}. So for each j, the contribution to dp[i] is dp[j] multiplied by the number of distinct characters in s[j..i-1}.

So the recurrence is:

dp[i] = sum_{j=0 to i-1} (dp[j] * cnt[j][i-1])

where cnt[j][i-1} is the number of distinct characters in the substring from j to i-1 (inclusive).

But this requires O(n^2) time and space for precomputing cnt[j][i-1}.

But using the earlier insight, we can compute this sum efficiently by tracking for each character c the last occurrence up to i-1, and then for each c, the sum of dp[j] for j <= last_pos[c] is the sum of all j where the substring j..i-1 includes c.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

For the current i (processing the first i characters), which is the substring s[0..i-1}, when we want to compute dp[i}, we need to find for all possible j (the split point), the number of distinct characters in s[j..i-1}.

The key insight is that for each character c present in s[j..i-1}, there is at least one occurrence in s[j..i-1}, which is equivalent to the last occurrence of c up to i-1 being >= j.

So for each character c, let last_pos[c] be the last occurrence of c in the entire string up to i-1 (i.e., in s[0..i-1}).

Then, for a j to have c present in s[j..i-1}, j must be <= last_pos[c}.

Wait, no. Because j is the starting index of the run. For example, if the last occurrence of c is at position k (0-based), then j must be <=k and the run is from j to i-1. So j can be from 0 to k, and in the substring j..i-1, c is present (since k is within j..i-1).

So for each character c, the possible j's are from 0 to last_pos[c].

Thus, for each character c, the sum of dp[j} for j from 0 to last_pos[c} is the contribution of c to the sum.

So the total dp[i} is the sum over all c of (sum of dp[j} for j from 0 to last_pos[c}).

But this is only true if the substring j..i-1 contains c. But wait, in the substring j..i-1, the last occurrence of c is last_pos[c}, which is >= j. So yes, c is present in the substring.

Thus, for each character c, the contribution to dp[i} is sum_{j=0 to last_pos[c}} dp[j}.

But since j ranges from 0 to last_pos[c}, and the run is from j to i-1, the length of the run is i-1 - j +1 = i - j. So the split is after j characters. For example, if the split is j=0, the run is the entire substring 0..i-1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

The current step is to compute dp[i], which is the number of configurations for the first i characters. For each possible j (the split point), the last run is from j to i-1. So the configuration is dp[j} (number of ways to split the first j characters) multiplied by the number of possible characters for the last run (j to i-1}.

The number of possible characters for the last run is the number of distinct characters in s[j..i-1}.

For each character c present in s[j..i-1}, we can choose c as the character of the last run.

But to compute the sum over j of dp[j} multiplied by the number of possible characters in s[j..i-1}, we can split the sum into two parts:

sum_{j=0 to i-1} dp[j} * (sum_{c in s[j..i-1}} 1} )

= sum_{c in all characters} sum_{j where c is in s[j..i-1}} dp[j} }

So for each character c, we find all j where c is present in s[j..i-1}, and sum the dp[j} for those j. Then, sum all these sums for each c.

But how to compute this efficiently.

For each character c, the j's where c is in s[j..i-1} are those j where j <= last_pos[c}, where last_pos[c} is the last occurrence of c in s[0..i-1}.

Because for j to be <= last_pos[c}, the substring j..i-1 includes last_pos[c}, so c is present.

Thus, the sum for c is the sum of dp[j} for j from 0 to last_pos[c}.

Wait, no. Because j can be any value such that j <= last_pos[c} and the run is j to i-1. So the maximum j for which c is present in j..i-1} is last_pos[c} (since j can be up to last_pos[c} to include that position in the substring j..i-1}.

Wait, for example, if the last occurrence of c is at position k (0-based), then the substring j..i-1 includes position k if j <=k. So j can be from 0 to k.

Thus, the sum for c is the sum of dp[j} for j from 0 to k.

But k is the last occurrence of c in s[0..i-1}.

So for each i, we track for each character c the last occurrence up to i-1.

Then, for each c, the contribution to dp[i} is the sum of dp[0} + dp[1} + ... + dp[k} }, where k is last_pos[c}.

But if last_pos[c} is -1 (meaning c is not present in s[0..i-1}), then there is no contribution.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

Initialize a dictionary last_occurrence for each character, initially set to -1.

Initialize a prefix_sum array where prefix_sum[i} is the sum of dp[0} to dp[i}.

For each i from 1 to n:

   current_char = s[i-1}

   update last_occurrence[current_char} to i-1 (since the current character is at position i-1}

   for each character c in 'a' to 'z':

       if last_occurrence[c} is not -1:

           k = last_occurrence[c}

           sum_c = prefix_sum[k}

           total += sum_c

   dp[i} = total % MOD

   prefix_sum[i} = (prefix_sum[i-1} + dp[i}) % MOD

Wait, but what about other characters that may have their last_occurrence set to values before i-1. For example, for a character c that last occurred at position k < i-1, but the current character is not c.

In that case, the last_occurrence[c} is still k. When processing i, the current character is s[i-1} which is not c, but the last_occurrence[c} remains at k.

Thus, for each c, the sum is the prefix_sum up to last_occurrence[c}.

Thus, the algorithm works as follows:

For each i (processing the first i characters), after updating the last_occurrence of the current character, for all characters c, we check if their last_occurrence is not -1. For each such c, the sum for j where c is present in j..i-1 is the sum of dp[j} for j=0 to last_occurrence[c}.

But since the last_occurrence[c} is the last position where c appears in the first i-1 characters, this sum includes all j where j <= last_occurrence[c} and the substring j..i-1 includes c.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

3

aaa

Initialization: dp[0} = 1, prefix_sum[0} = 1.

Processing i=1 (s[0} is 'a'):

Update last_occurrence['a'} to 0.

For each c in a-z:

For c='a', last_occurrence is 0. sum_c = prefix_sum[0} = 1.

Other characters have last_occurrence=-1, so no contribution.

total = 1.

dp[1} = 1.

prefix_sum[1} = 1 + 1 = 2.

Processing i=2 (s[1} is 'a'):

Update last_occurrence['a'} to 1.

For each c in a-z:

Only 'a' contributes. sum_c = prefix_sum[1} = 2.

dp[2} = 2.

prefix_sum[2} = 2 + 2 =4.

Processing i=3 (s[2} is 'a'):

Update last_occurrence['a'} to 2.

sum_c for 'a' is prefix_sum[2} =4.

dp[3} =4.

But the sample input's answer is 1. What's wrong?

Wait, the sample input has all 'a's, so the answer should be 1, because no attacks can change the configuration.

But according to the code's calculation, dp[3} would be 4.

Hmm, that's a problem. So there must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, what is the definition of dp[i} in this approach?

The code's approach says dp[i} is the number of ways to split the first i characters into runs where each run's character is present in the corresponding interval.

But in the first sample, all characters are 'a's. So the splits can be any possible splits where each run's character is 'a'.

But in the problem statement, the answer is 1 because all configurations are 'aaa' regardless of attacks.

But according to the code's approach, the number of possible splits into runs where each run's character is 'a' is the number of ways to split the string into runs. For example, for 'aaa', the possible splits are:

- [a, a, a}: three runs of a.

- [a, aa}: two runs.

- [aa, a}: two runs.

- [aaa}: one run.

Each of these splits would have their runs' characters be 'a's. But according to the code's approach, all of these splits are counted, leading to a total of 4 ways (since dp[3} =4), but the correct answer is 1.

This indicates a fundamental flaw in the approach.

Ah! Because the code's approach counts different splits as different configurations, but in reality, any split would result in the same configuration of 'aaa', since all runs are 'a's.

So the code's approach is incorrect. It overcounts because the splits into different runs (even if the character is the same) are considered different configurations, but according to the problem statement, all such splits lead to the same configuration.

So the approach is flawed.

Wait, but the problem says that different configurations are based on the final arrangement of the bacteria, not the way they were formed. So the number of configurations is the number of distinct strings that can be formed, regardless of how many ways they can be split into runs.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect because it counts different split ways that lead to the same string as separate configurations. For example, in the first sample, the code's approach would give 4 (for i=3}, which corresponds to the possible ways of splitting the 'aaa' into runs, but the actual number of configurations is 1.

Thus, the dynamic programming approach is not correct. So this suggests that the initial idea is wrong.

Hmm. So the problem is that the code's approach counts the number of ways to split the string into runs (each with a character present in the interval), but the actual number of configurations is the number of distinct strings that can be formed by merging runs. For example, in the first sample, the code's approach would count 4 splits, but they all result in the same string 'aaa'.

Thus, the code's approach is not solving the problem correctly.

So where's the mistake?

The key is that the code counts the number of ways to split the string into runs, but each split corresponds to a different configuration. However, different splits may result in the same configuration. For example, splitting 'aaa' into [a, a, a} and [aa, a} both result in the same string. So the code's approach is counting the number of splits, not the number of distinct configurations.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect.

This is a critical error. So the previous reasoning was incorrect.

We need to find a different approach.

Alternative plan:

The problem is to find all possible final configurations, which are strings formed by merging adjacent segments through attacks. Each attack can only merge adjacent segments if one takes over the other.

Each final configuration must be a string where each run of the same character is such that the original string had at least one occurrence of that character in the run's interval.

But how to model this.

Another observation: the final configuration can have a run of character c if and only if there exists at least one occurrence of c in that run's interval in the original string. Because otherwise, there's no way for c to be in that run.

Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct strings that can be formed by merging adjacent characters, where each merged run must contain at least one occurrence of its character in the original string.

But how to model all such possible strings.

This problem is similar to the problem of counting the number of distinct strings that can be formed by merging adjacent pairs in a way that each merged segment has a character present in the original segment.

But the key is that each merged segment can be formed by merging any set of adjacent segments, but the character of the merged segment must be present in the original segments.

Thus, the problem is to count all possible partitions of the original string into runs (segments), where each run's character is present in the original run's interval.

The number of such partitions is the same as the number of possible distinct strings generated by these partitions.

But two different partitions can generate the same string. For example, splitting 'aaa' into three runs of a, or two runs of a, or one run of a, all result in the same string 'aaa'.

Thus, the number of distinct strings is not the same as the number of possible partitions. So the initial approach of counting the number of partitions (via DP) is incorrect.

This is a big problem. So the previous approach is invalid.

We need to find a way to count the distinct strings generated by the possible partitions.

Alternative idea: for each possible run structure (sequence of characters), determine if it can be formed by merging adjacent segments such that each merged segment contains at least one occurrence of its character in the original string.

But how to count this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to model the possible runs and track the possible characters and their positions.

Another idea: For each possible position in the string, track the possible characters that can be at that position in the final configuration, and the possible ranges they can form.

But this seems challenging.

Let's think of the final configuration as a series of runs. Each run is a maximal segment of the same character. For each such run, the character must be present in the original string's interval covered by the run.

So, for example, if the original string is 'ab', the possible runs are:

- 'a' followed by 'b' (original, no attacks).

- 'a' followed by 'a' (attack from left to right).

- 'b' followed by 'b' (attack from right to left).

Each of these corresponds to a different string.

But the total number of distinct strings is 3, which is the correct answer.

Thus, the problem is to count the number of distinct strings formed by merging adjacent runs, where each merged run's character is present in the original segments.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct strings formed by merging adjacent characters, with the merged segments' characters present in the original intervals.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach is to model the possible runs using dynamic programming, tracking the current position and the current character of the last run.

The idea is to have a DP table where dp[i][c} represents the number of ways to form the first i characters with the last run being of character c. Then, transitions would occur when adding a new run of a different character.

But since the problem requires distinct strings, not the number of ways to form them, this approach would count different ways to reach the same string multiple times, leading to overcounting.

Hmm. Alternatively, for each position i and character c, track whether it is possible to form a run ending at i with character c. Then, the number of distinct strings is the number of different sequences of characters possible.

But this requires tracking the possible sequences, which is O(n * 26) states. But how to ensure that each distinct string is counted once.

Alternatively, for each position i and character c, track the set of possible previous characters d that can form a valid string up to i. This would allow us to build the possible sequences.

But this would require O(n^2 * 26) time, which is not feasible.

Wait, but the problem requires the number of distinct final strings, not the number of ways to form them. So, perhaps we can model the possible runs in a way that tracks the current character and the earliest start position of the current run.

Another approach inspired by the problem of finding the number of distinct palindromic substrings:

For each position i, and for each character c, track the possible start positions of a run ending at i with character c. Then, the total number of distinct strings is the sum over all possible runs and their combinations.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as finding all possible ways to choose a sequence of characters c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, such that:

- Each c_i is present in some interval [a_i, b_i} of the original string.

- The intervals [a_1, b_1}, [a_2, b_2}, ..., are non-overlapping and cover the entire string.

- For consecutive intervals, the characters c_i and c_{i+1} are different.

The number of such sequences is the number of distinct strings.

But how to model this.

Another idea: the distinct strings are determined by the positions where the character changes. For example, between positions i and i+1, the character can change, which means that in the final configuration, the run ends at i and a new run starts at i+1.

So, the problem is to determine all possible partitions of the string into runs such that each run's character is present in its interval. The number of distinct strings is the number of possible sequences of characters in these runs.

So, the key is to model the possible transitions between characters. For example, a run of 'a' can be followed by a run of 'b' if there exists a position where the 'a' run ends and the 'b' run begins, and the 'b' run's interval contains a 'b' in the original string.

But how to model this.

Let's think of dynamic programming where dp[i][c} is the number of distinct strings that can be formed up to position i, ending with character c.

The transition would be:

For each position i and character c, for each previous position j < i, and character d != c, if the interval j+1..i has at least one c in the original string, then add the number of ways to form up to j with character d to dp[i][c}.

But this is O(n^2 * 26^2), which is way too slow for n=5e3.

Hmm. This approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the problem's sample inputs:

The problem is similar to the problem of counting the number of distinct palindromic subsequences, but here we need to count distinct strings formed by merging adjacent regions.

Another approach inspired by the first sample:

Each possible final string is a sequence of runs, where each run's character is present in the original string's corresponding interval. Thus, the problem can be reduced to finding the number of distinct strings that can be formed by such runs.

But how to efficiently count this.

The key insight might be that each character in the final string must appear in a contiguous interval where all positions in that interval are covered by a single run, and that run's character is present in the original interval.

So, for example, if the original string is 'abacaba', the final string can be 'abacaba', 'abcaba' (merging the first two 'a's), etc., but each merged run must include at least one instance of its character in the original string.

But how to model this.

Another observation: the possible characters for a position i in the final string can be any character that appears in the original string from some position to the left of i, and can propagate to i through attacks.

Wait, perhaps the final character at position i can be any character that appears in the original string's interval [L, R], where L is the leftmost position that can reach i via attacks, and R is the rightmost position that can reach i via attacks.

But this is similar to the problem of finding for each position i the set of characters that can appear there in the final configuration.

But how to compute this set.

Let me think about the attack process. The attacks can be thought of as propagating a character to adjacent positions. Once a character is propagated to a position, that position can then propagate its new character further.

For example, if the original string is 'ab', the first position can attack the second (turning it into 'a'), or the second can attack the first (turning it into 'b'). Or no attacks (remaining 'ab').

Thus, the possible characters for each position are:

- Position 0: 'a' or 'b' (depending on attacks).
- Position 1: 'a' or 'b'.

But the final configurations are 'ab', 'aa', 'bb'.

So the possible characters for each position are not independent. For example, if position 0 is 'a' and position 1 is 'b', that's allowed only if no attacks happened. If position 0 is 'a' and position 1 is 'a', that's allowed if position 0 attacked position 1. Similarly for 'b' and 'b'.

Thus, the final configuration is determined by a set of runs, where each run's character must be present in the original string's corresponding interval.

So, the problem reduces to finding all possible sequences of runs (with characters present in the original intervals) such that consecutive runs have different characters.

This suggests that the number of distinct configurations is equal to the number of such sequences of runs.

But how to count them.

An alternative approach inspired by the original DP idea but corrected to count distinct strings:

We can model the DP as tracking the last character of the current run and the earliest start position of that run. For each position i, and character c, we track whether it is possible to have a run of c ending at i.

The DP can be defined as follows:

- For each i, and character c, track the set of possible start positions s of the current run (s <= i), such that the interval [s, i] contains c in the original string.

- The number of distinct configurations is the number of different strings that can be formed by combining such runs.

But this is still vague.

Another Idea:

The problem can be viewed as a graph problem where each node represents a position and a character, and edges represent possible transitions to the next character. However, this approach might not be feasible for n=5000.

Alternative Plan:

Let's model the problem as a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, and character c, we track the number of distinct strings up to i that end with character c. To avoid counting duplicates, each state is the last character and the earliest possible starting position of the current run. However, this might be too memory-intensive.

Wait, perhaps we can use a DP table where dp[i][c} represents the set of possible characters that can be formed up to position i with the last character being c. But this is not feasible for large n.

Alternatively, since each run must consist of a character present in the original interval, the transitions between characters can only happen at positions where the next character is different and the new run's character is present in the new interval.

Thus, for each position i, we can track all possible pairs (current_char, start), where start is the starting position of the current run. This would allow us to track the possible transitions, but the time complexity would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=5e3.

Alternative Idea inspired by the original approach but adjusted:

The initial approach counts the number of ways to split into runs, but each such split corresponds to a unique string. But this is not the case. However, perhaps the number of distinct strings is exactly the number of ways to split into runs with different characters. But this is only true if the same character cannot appear in consecutive runs. So, for example, merging runs of the same character into a single run.

But this is not the case. For example, if you have 'aab', you can split into 'a' and 'ab', which would result in 'aab', or merge the first two 'a's into a single run, leading to the same string 'aab'. Thus, multiple splits can lead to the same string.

Thus, the initial approach counts the number of splits, not the number of distinct strings.

So the initial approach is incorrect.

Thus, a new approach is needed.

Let's think of the problem differently. For each possible final configuration, it's a string composed of runs of characters. Each run's character must be present in the original string's interval covered by the run. And consecutive runs must have different characters.

Thus, the problem is to count the number of such strings.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach inspired by interval DP:

We can model the problem using dynamic programming where dp[i][c} represents the number of distinct strings for the first i positions ending with character c.

The transitions would be:

For each position i, and for each character c:

   if the current character s[i} can be part of a run ending at i with character c, then we can extend the previous runs or start a new run.

But how to model this.

Let's think:

To compute dp[i][c}, we need to consider all possible previous positions j where the last run ended at j with a character different from c. Then, the new run would be from j+1 to i, with character c, which must be present in the original string's j+1..i.

Thus, the recurrence is:

dp[i][c} = sum_{d != c} dp[j][d} for all j < i where the substring j+1..i has at least one c.

This is similar to the initial approach but tracks the last character. However, the time complexity is O(n^2 * 26), which is 5e3^2 *26 = 650 million operations, which is way too slow for Python.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea:

For each character c, we can precompute the positions where c appears in the string. Then, for each position i, the earliest and latest positions where c appears before i.

But not sure.

Another Idea:

The problem can be viewed as follows: each run in the final string must consist of a character c, and there must be at least one occurrence of c in the run's interval. Additionally, consecutive runs must have different characters.

Thus, the problem is to count all possible sequences of characters c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, where each c_i != c_{i+1}, and for each run corresponding to c_i, the interval of that run contains at least one occurrence of c_i in the original string.

But how to model this.

An efficient way to model this would be to use dynamic programming where dp[i][c} represents the number of valid configurations for the first i characters ending with character c.

The transitions would be:

For each character c and position i:

   dp[i][c} = sum_{d != c} (sum over all possible runs ending at i with c} ways to form up to j with d and a run from j+1 to i with c)

But again, this is O(n^2 * 26^2) time, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea inspired by the initial sample's mistake:

The initial approach counts the number of splits into runs, which is not the same as the number of distinct configurations. However, if we can find a way to merge the splits that result in the same configuration, perhaps using some hashing or inclusion-exclusion.

But this seems challenging.

Alternative Idea inspired by the problem's examples:

Let's consider that the final configuration is determined by the set of positions where the character changes. For example, if there are k changes, then the configuration is determined by the positions and the characters in between.

But again, this doesn't lead to an efficient algorithm.

Perhaps another way to think about this is that the final configuration is determined by the union of all possible attack sequences, which can be represented as the set of all possible ways to replace adjacent characters with their attackers.

But since the order of attacks can vary, it's hard to model.

Another Idea inspired by the problem's third sample:

In the third sample, 'babb' (n=4) results in 11 possible configurations. The explanation says that multiple attacks can happen. The answer is larger than the number of possible splits into runs.

This suggests that the initial approach (counting splits) is incorrect, but how?

Wait, let's compute the splits for 'babb':

The string is 'b', 'a', 'b', 'b'.

Possible splits into runs where each run's character is present in the interval:

For example, the entire string is one run of 'b' (since there are 'b's in the original interval). So that's one configuration.

Another split is 'b', 'a', 'bb' (run of 'a' requires the interval to contain 'a', which it does).

But the final string for this split is 'babb', which is the same as the original.

Another split could be 'ba', 'bb' (but the first run 'ba' must have a character present in the interval. 'b' is present. So if the run is 'b', then the interval is 0..1 (positions 0 and 1). But 'a' is present there. So the run can be 'a' if there's an 'a' in the interval. So 'ba' can be a run of 'a', but that's not possible because the original interval 0..1 has 'b' and 'a'. So the run can be 'a' if there's an 'a' in the interval.

Thus, the run from 0..1 can be 'a' (since 'a' is present), and the remaining runs can be 'bb'.

So this split would result in 'aabb', which is a possible configuration.

But the initial approach would count this split as a valid configuration.

Thus, the initial approach's DP count would be higher than the correct answer, but in the third sample, the initial approach's count may be higher than 11, but the correct answer is 11.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect.

Thus, we need to find a different way to model the problem.

Another Idea inspired by the problem's statement:

When a colony attacks an adjacent colony, the attacked colony's type changes to the attacker's type. This process can happen in any order, but each attack can only propagate the attacker's type.

The final configuration is determined by which colonies have managed to propagate their type through attacks to other regions.

But the order of attacks can affect the final configuration.

But the problem requires considering all possible sequences of attacks, which can be very large. So simulating all possible sequences is impossible.

But perhaps there's a way to model the possible final configurations based on the initial string's structure.

For example, each position's final character can be the same as any of the original characters in some interval that can reach it through a series of attacks.

Thus, for each position i, the possible characters are the set of characters in the original string's interval [L_i, R_i}, where L_i is the leftmost position that can reach i via attacks, and R_i is the rightmost position that can reach i via attacks.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a position i, the possible characters are the characters that appear in the original string's interval [L, R], where L is the leftmost position that can influence i, and R is the rightmost position that can influence i.

But how to determine L and R.

Another Idea inspired by the problem's attack rules:

Each attack can propagate a character to an adjacent position. Thus, the final character of a position can be the same as any character to its left or right that can reach it through a chain of attacks.

For example, position i's final character can be any character in the original string that is present in the connected component formed by the attack chain.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the final character of each position can be any character that is present in the original string's connected component, where two positions are connected if there's a path of adjacent positions that can be attacked in some order to propagate a character.

But this is not accurate. For example, if the original string is 'ab', then the connected component for position 0 (a) and position 1 (b) are connected. But the possible final characters are a, b, or the entire string can become 'a' or 'b', or remain 'ab'.

But the connected component would include both positions, but the final configuration depends on the order of attacks.

This suggests that the final characters are determined by the set of characters that can propagate to each position through a chain of attacks, but the order of attacks allows certain configurations.

But this is not helpful for modeling.

Alternative Idea inspired by the problem's note:

The third sample's answer is 11. The input is 'babb' (n=4). The note says that more than one attack can happen.

So, after multiple attacks, the possible configurations can be combinations of various attack paths.

But how to model all possible attack sequences.

Another Idea inspired by the problem's possible transitions:

The possible final configurations are those where each run of the same character can be formed by expanding the original segments through attacks. For example, a segment of 'a's can expand to the left and/or right by attacking adjacent segments, turning them into 'a's.

Thus, the final configuration is determined by which original segments have expanded to cover neighboring regions.

Thus, the problem is to count all possible merged regions that can be formed by expanding original segments, where each merged region's character is the original segment's character.

But how to count this.

This seems similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to merge adjacent segments with the same character, but here the mergers are via attacks and can be done in any order.

But perhaps the final configuration is determined by the set of positions that are covered by the expansion of original segments.

For example, each original character can expand to the left or right, and the final configuration is a set of merged regions where each region's character is the character of the original segment that expanded to cover it.

But the expansion can only happen if there's a path of adjacent positions where the character can be taken over.

Thus, for each original segment, the merged region can be any interval that contains the original segment and is bounded by other segments that are not merged into it.

But this is getting complicated.

Another Idea inspired by the problem's note:

The third sample's input is 'babb'. The possible attacks can happen in sequences that lead to different configurations.

For example, the first attack could be from the first 'b' (position 0) to the second 'a' (position 1), turning it into 'b'. Then, the new 'b' (position 1) can attack position 2 'b' (which is already 'b'), or attack position 0. But this doesn't change anything. Alternatively, the third 'b' (position 2) can attack position 3 'b' (no change). Or position 2 can attack position 1, but it's already 'b'.

But after the first attack, the string becomes 'bbbb'. Or other sequences can lead to other configurations.

Thus, the final configuration depends on the order of attacks, but certain configurations are possible based on how the characters can propagate.

But this suggests that the final configuration is determined by the set of original segments that have expanded their influence.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the key is that each character in the final configuration must be the same as some original character in a contiguous block, and these blocks are formed by merging adjacent segments through attacks.

Thus, the final configuration's characters can be any combination of the original characters, as long as each contiguous block in the final configuration has at least one occurrence of its character in the corresponding original interval.

But this is the same as the initial approach's model.

But in that case, why did the first sample's initial approach give an incorrect answer?

Ah! Because in the initial approach, the code's model counts the number of ways to split into such runs, but the problem requires counting the number of distinct strings, which is the same as the number of ways to split into runs where each run's character is unique from the previous.

For example, in the first sample, 'aaa', the only possible split is a single run of 'a'. Thus, the code's approach should return 1 for this case, but according to the initial approach's code, it returns 4.

Thus, the initial approach's model is incorrect.

Thus, we need to find a different way to model the problem.

An alternative approach inspired by the correct observation that each run in the final configuration must have a character present in the original interval, and consecutive runs must have different characters.

Thus, the problem is to count the number of such sequences of runs.

This is similar to the problem of counting the number of distinct strings formed by merging adjacent characters, where each merged segment has at least one occurrence of its character in the original interval.

This problem can be modeled with dynamic programming where we track the last character and the earliest position where the current run could have started.

But how to efficiently compute this.

Here's the idea:

We can use dynamic programming with the following state:

- dp[i][c} = the number of distinct strings ending at position i with the last character c.

The transition is:

For each position i, and each character c present in the original string up to position i:

   dp[i][c} = sum of dp[j][d} for all j < i and d != c, where the substring j+1..i contains at least one c in the original string.

Additionally, we can have the case where the entire substring 0..i is merged into a single run of c, which is accounted for by checking if c is present in 0..i.

The base case is dp[0][c} = 1 if c is the first character, else 0.

But this approach is O(n^2 * 26^2), which is not feasible for n=5000.

But perhaps we can optimize this.

Let's think of the transitions:

For each i, and character c, we need to sum over all j < i and d != c such that the substring j+1..i contains c.

This can be optimized by precomputing for each position i and character c the earliest j where c appears in j+1..i.

Alternatively, for each character c, and position i, precompute the last occurrence of c before i.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Another Idea inspired by the need to track the earliest possible j for each c:

For each character c, we can keep track of the last occurrence up to position i. Then, for each position i, the earliest possible j for c is the last occurrence of c before i.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each character c, we can track a list of positions where c appears in the original string.

Then, for a given i, any j that is less than i and such that there is a c in j+1..i can be determined.

But this again requires O(n^2) time.

This seems like a dead end.

Alternative Idea inspired by the problem's constraints and the initial approach:

The initial approach's model counts the number of ways to split into runs, but the actual number of distinct strings is the number of possible distinct sequences of runs where each run's character is different from the previous.

Thus, if we can model the DP to track the last character of the current run, and for each new character, ensure that it is different from the previous, then we can compute the number of distinct strings.

This is the same as the earlier idea of dp[i][c} being the number of distinct strings ending at i with character c.

But the transitions are:

dp[i][c} = sum_{d != c} (sum_{j where substring j+1..i has c} dp[j][d} )

But how to compute this efficiently.

The key is that for each character c, the sum_{j where substring j+1..i has c} is the sum of dp[j][d} for all j where j+1 <= k <= i, where k is the last occurrence of c in the substring j+1..i.

But this is still O(n^2 * 26).

But perhaps we can precompute for each character c and position i, the sum of dp[j][d} for all j <= last_pos[c} and d != c.

Let's define for each character c and i:

last_pos[c} is the last occurrence of c up to position i.

sum_prev[c} = sum_{d != c} sum_{j=0}^{last_pos[c}} dp[j][d} }

Then, dp[i][c} = sum_prev[c} + (if the entire substring from 0 to i has c, then 1 else 0).

Wait, not sure.

But perhaps the sum_prev[c} is the sum over all j <= last_pos[c} of sum_{d != c} dp[j][d} }, which represents all possible ways to end at j with character d != c, and then form a new run from j+1 to i with character c.

This way, the sum_prev[c} is the total number of ways to end at i with character c by merging a new run of c that starts at j+1 and ends at i.

In addition, there's the possibility of having a run of c that starts at 0 and ends at i.

Thus, the recurrence would be:

dp[i][c} = sum_prev[c} + (1 if c is present in 0..i else 0).

But this is not quite correct. Because the run from 0..i is a single run, which should be accounted for once if c is present.

But how to compute sum_prev[c}:

sum_prev[c} is the sum over all j < i of sum_{d != c} dp[j][d} } * [c is present in j+1..i} ]

But using the same insight as before, the sum can be computed as the sum over all d != c of the sum of dp[j][d} for j <= last_pos[c} }.

Thus, sum_prev[c} = sum_{d != c} prefix_sum_d[last_pos[c} ]

Where prefix_sum_d is the prefix sum of dp[j][d} up to j.

Thus, for each character c, and each i, the steps would be:

1. Update last_pos[c} to the last occurrence of c up to i.

2. Compute sum_prev[c} as the sum for all d != c of prefix_sum_d[last_pos[c} ].

3. Add to this sum the case where the entire substring from 0 to i is a run of c, which is 1 if c is present in 0..i.

But this approach requires maintaining a prefix sum for each character.

Let's see:

For each character c, we maintain a prefix sum array prefix_c, where prefix_c[i} = sum_{j=0}^i dp[j][c}.

Then, for each i and c:

sum_prev[c} = sum_{d != c} prefix_d[last_pos[c} - 1} ]

Because the sum for d != c is the sum of dp[j][d} for j up to last_pos[c} -1 (since j+1 <= last_pos[c} ).

Then, dp[i][c} = sum_prev[c} + (1 if c is present in 0..i and this is the first run).

Wait, no. The case where the entire substring is a single run of c is already covered by sum_prev[c} when j=0 and d is the previous character (but in this case, d would not exist, so it's included in the sum_prev[c}).

No, this is not correct.

The sum_prev[c} is the sum of all ways to form a run of c ending at i by merging a previous run of a different character. The case where the entire substring is a single run of c is covered by the initial state.

Thus, for i=0 (first character), dp[0][s[0} ] = 1.

For i>0, the sum_prev[c} + (1 if there is a c in 0..i and it's the first run) is not needed, because the initial case is already handled by the sum_prev[c} when j=0 and d is nothing.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

But let's try to proceed with this approach.

Initialize:

prefix_c arrays for each character c, initialized to 0.

dp[0][c} = 1 if c == s[0}, else 0.

prefix_c[0} = dp[0][c} for all c.

For each i from 1 to n-1:

   current_char = s[i}

   for each character c in 'a' to 'z':

       last_pos[c} = last occurrence of c in s[0..i}

       sum_prev[c} = 0

       for d in 'a' to 'z' where d != c:

           sum_prev[c} += prefix_d[last_pos[c} -1} ]

       if c is present in s[0..i}:

           sum_prev[c} += 1  # This accounts for the case where the entire substring 0..i is a single run of c.

       dp[i][c} = sum_prev[c} mod MOD

       prefix_c[i} = (prefix_c[i-1} + dp[i][c}) mod MOD

But this approach has a time complexity of O(n * 26^2), which is 5e3 * 26^2 = 338,000 operations, which is manageable.

But how to implement this.

Let's test this with the first sample input:

Sample 1:

n = 3, s = "aaa".

Processing i=0 (s[0} is 'a'):

dp[0][a} = 1.

prefix_a[0} = 1.

Other characters have dp[0][c} = 0.

Processing i=1 (s[1} is 'a'):

current_char is 'a'.

For each character c:

if c == 'a':

   last_pos[a} is 1.

   sum_prev[a} = sum over d != a of prefix_d[last_pos[a} -1} = sum over d != a of prefix_d[0} ]

But for d != a, prefix_d[0} is 0 except for d = 'a', which is excluded.

Thus, sum_prev[a} = 0.

But c is present in 0..1, so sum_prev[a} += 1 (for the single run of 'a' from 0 to 1).

Thus, dp[1][a} = 1.

prefix_a[1} = 1 + 1 = 2.

Other characters' dp and prefix remain 0.

Processing i=2 (s[2} is 'a'):

for c = 'a':

   last_pos[a} = 2.

   sum_prev[a} = sum over d != a of prefix_d[1} ].

All other d have prefix_d[1} =0.

sum_prev[a} =0.

add 1 (since 'a' is present in 0..2.

dp[2][a} =1.

prefix_a[2} = 2 +1=3.

Thus, the total sum for all characters at i=2 is 1 (only 'a' is non-zero).

The final answer is sum of dp[2][c} for all c, which is 1, which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach seems correct.

Another sample: input 2:

n=2, s=ab.

Processing i=0 (s[0} is 'a'):

dp[0][a} =1, others 0.

prefix_a[0} =1.

i=1 (s[1} is 'b'):

Processing each character c:

For c = 'a':

   last_pos[a} is 0.

   sum_prev[a} = sum over d != a of prefix_d[0-1} ] (which is prefix_d[-1} =0 for all d.

sum_prev[a} =0.

Check if 'a' is present in 0..1 (s[0} is 'a', s[1} is 'b'). 'a' is present, so sum_prev[a} +=1.

dp[1][a} =1.

For c = 'b':

   last_pos[b} is 1.

   sum_prev[b} = sum over d !=b of prefix_d[1-1} = prefix_d[0} for d !=b.

prefix_a[0} is 1, others are 0.

So sum_prev[b} =1.

Check if 'b' is present in 0..1 (yes), sum_prev[b} +=1.

dp[1][b} =1+1=2?

Wait, no. The sum_prev[b} for d !=b is sum over d !=b prefix_d[0}:

prefix_a[0} is 1, others 0. So sum_prev[b} is 1.

Then, since 'b' is present in 0..1, sum_prev[b} +=1. So sum_prev[b} becomes 2.

Thus, dp[1][b} =2.

prefix_b[1} =0+2=2.

Other characters are 0.

Thus, the total for i=1 is 1 (a) +2 (b) =3, which matches the sample.

Thus, the approach seems correct.

Thus, this approach is correct.

Now, the code can be written as follows:

Initialize a list of prefix sums for each character.

For each character, track the last occurrence.

At each step, compute the sum_prev for each character.

The final answer is the sum of dp[n-1][c} for all c.

But wait, since the problem uses 1-based indices in the examples, but in code, the string is 0-based.

Now, the code:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct configurations of bacterial colonies in a test tube after any number of attacks, where each attack can merge adjacent colonies. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently track possible configurations while considering the constraints.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][c]` represents the number of distinct configurations ending at position `i` with the character `c`.
2. **Prefix Sum Array**: To efficiently compute sums over ranges, we maintain prefix sums for each character.
3. **Last Occurrence Tracking**: Track the last occurrence of each character to determine valid intervals where a character can form a run.
4. **Transition Logic**: For each position, compute the number of valid configurations by considering all possible previous characters and their valid intervals.

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

if n == 0:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Initialize last_occurrence for each character
last_occurrence = {chr(ord('a') + i): -1 for i in range(26)}

# prefix_sum[c][i] represents the sum of dp[0..i] for character c
prefix_sum = {c: [0] * n for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'}

# Initialize for the first character (i=0)
current_char = s[0]
for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
    if c == current_char:
        prefix_sum[c][0] = 1
    else:
        prefix_sum[c][0] = 0
last_occurrence[current_char] = 0

for i in range(1, n):
    current_char = s[i]
    new_dp = {c: 0 for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'}
    
    # Update last_occurrence for the current character
    last_occurrence[current_char] = i
    
    # Precompute the last occurrence of each character up to i
    current_last_occurrence = last_occurrence.copy()
    
    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        last_pos = current_last_occurrence[c]
        if last_pos == -1:
            new_dp[c] = 0
            continue
        
        # Calculate sum_prev by summing over all d != c
        sum_prev = 0
        for d in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
            if d == c:
                continue
            if last_pos > 0:
                sum_prev += prefix_sum[d][last_pos - 1]
            elif last_pos == 0:
                sum_prev += prefix_sum[d][0]  # j can be -1 (no previous run)
        sum_prev %= MOD
        
        # Add 1 if c is present in the interval 0..i (i.e., last_pos >=0)
        sum_prev += 1
        sum_prev %= MOD
        
        new_dp[c] = sum_prev
    
    # Update prefix_sum for each character
    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        if i == 0:
            prefix_sum[c][i] = new_dp[c]
        else:
            prefix_sum[c][i] = (prefix_sum[c][i-1] + new_dp[c]) % MOD

# The answer is the sum of new_dp for all characters at the last position
answer = 0
for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
    answer = (answer + new_dp[c]) % MOD

print(answer)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the prefix sums and track the last occurrence of each character.
2. **Dynamic Programming Transitions**: For each position, we compute the number of valid configurations by considering all possible previous characters and their valid intervals using prefix sums.
3. **Efficient Updates**: By maintaining prefix sums and tracking last occurrences, we efficiently compute transitions and avoid redundant calculations, ensuring the solution runs in O(n * 26^2) time, which is feasible for the given constraints.

This approach ensures we count all valid configurations by considering each possible character run and their valid intervals, leading to an efficient and correct solution.
