Okay, let's see. The problem is about building a tower with red and green blocks, following certain rules. We need to find the maximum possible height h such that we can build a tower of h levels using exactly r red and g green blocks. Then, count how many different configurations (ways to assign red or green to each level) there are for that maximum h. The answer has to be modulo 1e9+7.

Hmm, the key steps are: first determine the maximum possible h, then calculate the number of valid color assignments for that h that use no more than r and g blocks respectively, and sum to exactly h levels.

Let me start by thinking about how to find h. Each level i (starting from the top) has i blocks. So for a tower of h levels, the total blocks needed is the sum from 1 to h, which is h*(h+1)/2. But since each level can be either red or green, the sum of red levels and green levels' blocks must be <= r and g respectively, and their total equals the sum 1+2+...+h.

Wait no. Wait, the sum of the red levels (each being their level's count) plus the sum of green levels must equal the total required for h levels. Because each level is assigned to either red or green. So the total blocks used is exactly the sum of 1 to h. But the sum of red blocks used can't exceed r, and sum of green can't exceed g. So the sum 1+2+...+h must be <= r + g. But since h is the maximum possible, we need the largest h such that h*(h+1)/2 <= r + g. Wait, but that's only part of the problem. Because even if the sum of the h levels is <= r+g, maybe there's a way to arrange the colors such that the sum of red levels is <= r and green sum is <= g. For example, maybe r and g are both very small, but their sum is exactly h*(h+1)/2. But that's possible. So the maximum h is the largest h where there exists a partition of the required levels into red and green parts such that sum_red <= r and sum_green <= g.

So first step: find the maximum h where sum 1+..+h <= r+g, and there exists a way to split the levels into red and green such that sum_red <= r and sum_green <=g.

Wait, but the maximum h is the largest possible such that sum_1^h <= r + g, but also that the sum can be split into two parts (sum_red and sum_green) where sum_red <= r and sum_green <=g.

So how to compute h? Let's think of binary search. For a given h, check if it's possible to have sum_1^h <= r + g and that there exists a way to split the required levels into red and green such that the sum of red levels is <= r and sum of green is <= g.

Alternatively, the maximum h is the largest h where sum_1^h <= r + g, and (sum_1^h - g) <= r and (sum_1^h - r) <= g. Because sum_red can be at most sum_1^h, and sum_green can be at most sum_1^h. So for the split to exist, sum_red = sum_total - sum_green. So sum_red <= r requires sum_total - sum_green <= r. Which implies sum_green >= sum_total - r. But sum_green also must be <= g. So sum_total - r <= sum_green <= g. So the condition is that sum_total - r <= g. Because sum_green has to be >= sum_total - r (since sum_red is sum_total - sum_green and must be <= r), and also sum_green <= g. So sum_total - r <= g. Similarly, sum_total - g <= r.

Wait, maybe another way: the minimal sum_red possible for a given h is sum_total - g (since sum_red must be at least sum_total - g, because sum_green can't exceed g). And sum_red can't exceed r. So for there to be at least one valid split, sum_total - g <= r. Because sum_red can be as low as sum_total - g (if all possible green is used), but if sum_total - g > r, then even if we take all green possible, the sum_red would be sum_total - g, which exceeds r. So in that case, no split possible.

So combining these conditions: sum_1^h <= r + g, and sum_1^h - g <= r, and sum_1^h - r <= g. Wait, but sum_1^h - r <= g is equivalent to sum_1^h <= r + g, which is already our first condition. Because sum_1^h <= r+g implies sum_1^h - r <= g. So the only conditions are sum_1^h <= r+g and sum_1^h - g <= r (which is equivalent to sum_1^h <= r + g). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. For a given h, the total blocks needed is s = h*(h+1)/2. Then, the sum of red levels (sum_red) can be any value between (s - g) and min(r, s). Because sum_red must be <= r, and sum_green = s - sum_red must be <=g. So sum_red >= s - g. So the possible sum_red values are in [s - g, min(r, s)]. So for there to be any valid sum_red in this interval, the lower bound must be <= upper bound. So s - g <= min(r, s).

But min(r, s) is <= s, and s -g <= s only if g >=0. Which it is. So the condition is s -g <= r. Because sum_red has to be >= s - g (since sum_green = s - sum_red <=g => sum_red >= s -g). So sum_red must be >= s -g and <= r. So the interval is valid only if s -g <= r. So the condition is s <= r +g (which is already given since s is h*(h+1)/2 and h is chosen such that s <= r+g), and s -g <= r. Which is equivalent to s <= r +g. Wait, no. Because s <= r +g is the sum of r and g. So s -g <= r is s <= r +g. So the condition s -g <= r is automatically true. So perhaps for the maximum h, the only condition is that s <= r +g. Wait, but that can't be. For example, suppose r=0, g=3. Then h can be 2 (sum 3). So sum_red would have to be 0, sum_green 3. Which is allowed. So sum_red is 0 >= 3 -3=0, and <=0. So yes.

Wait another example: r=2, g=2. Suppose h is 2. s=3. Then possible sum_red can be between 3-2=1 and min(2,3) =2. So sum_red can be 1 or 2. So possible splits.

But if h is 3, s=6. r+g=4. So sum 6 is 6>4. So h=3 is invalid.

So the maximum h is the largest h where h*(h+1)/2 <= r +g, and h*(h+1)/2 -g <= r. Wait, because sum_red must be >= s -g, and sum_red <=r. So s -g <= r. So that's s <= r +g. Which is already the condition. So why is that the case?

Wait, no. Because s is the sum of all blocks needed. So if s <= r +g, then sum_red can be s - g (since sum_green = s - sum_red = g). But then sum_red = s -g. But sum_red must be <= r. So s -g <= r. So s <= r +g. But that's already true. Wait, no. Because s can be <= r+g, but s -g can be > r. For example, take s=5, g=3. Then s -g =2. If r=1, then 2 <=1 is false. So even though s=5 <= r +g=4 (no, wait in this case, r+g is 1+3=4. s=5 would not be <= r+g. So in that case, h would be 2, since sum 3 <=4. So the condition s<=r+g is necessary. So perhaps for the maximum h, the sum s is the largest possible h where s<=r+g and s -g <=r.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So the maximum h is the largest h such that:

s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r +g, and s - min(g, s) <= r.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the example where r=4, g=6. As in the first sample.

s for h=4 is 4*5/2=10. r+g=10. So sum_red can be 10 -6=4, which is <=4. So yes. So h=4 is possible.

Another example: if r=0, g=3. Then s=3 for h=2. sum_red is 0 (since s -g=3-3=0 <=0). So it's possible.

Another example: r=0, g=0. But the constraints say r+g >=1. So that's not a possible input.

So the way to find h is to compute the maximum h where s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g and s - g <= r (since sum_red must be >= s -g and sum_red <=r). So s -g <=r is equivalent to sum_red >= s -g and sum_red <=r. So the interval is valid if s -g <= r, which is required.

Wait, but s can be <= r+g, but s -g may be greater than r. For example, if s=5, r=2, g=3. Then s=5 <=5. But s -g=2, which is <=r=2. So sum_red can be 2, which is allowed. So sum_red=2, sum_green=3. Which is okay.

Wait, but in that case, the sum_red is 2 which is <=r, sum_green is3 <=g. So it's allowed.

So the conditions are s <= r+g and s -g <=r. Because s -g is the minimal sum_red possible, and if that is <=r, then the interval is valid.

So to find h, we can find the maximum h where h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g and h*(h+1)/2 -g <=r.

Wait, but how can we compute that?

Alternatively, the maximum h is the largest h such that h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g, and sum_red can be at least s -g and at most r. But perhaps this is redundant because once s <= r+g, the sum_red can be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the maximum h is determined by the largest h for which s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g. Because for such h, the sum_red can be adjusted between s -g and min(r, s). So as long as s <= r+g, there's at least one possible split. Because s <= r+g implies that sum_red can be s -g (sum_green =g) and sum_red would be s -g <= r because s -g = (h*(h+1)/2 -g) <=r? Wait no. For example, h=3, s=6. r=3, g=3. s=6 <=6. sum_red can be s -g =3. Which is <=r=3. So yes. But if r=2, g=3. s=6=2+3=5? No, 2+3=5 <6, so h would not be 3. So in that case, the maximum h is 3 only if s<=r+g. So in that case, the maximum h is 3 only if 6<=5, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is to compute the maximum possible h by binary search. For each candidate h, compute s = h*(h+1)/2. Check if s <= r+g, and that there exists a sum_red between [s -g, r] and sum_red >=0, sum_red <=s. Because sum_red can't be negative. So the valid sum_red range is max(s -g, 0) <= sum_red <= min(r, s).

If this interval is non-empty, then h is possible. So the maximum h is the largest h where s <= r+g, and the interval [max(s -g, 0), min(r, s)] is non-empty.

But how can that interval be non-empty?

max(s -g, 0) <= min(r, s) ?

Which is equivalent to s -g <= min(r, s) and 0 <= min(r, s).

But 0 <= min(r, s) is always true (since r and s are non-negative). So the condition is s -g <= min(r, s).

But min(r, s) is the smaller of r and s. So s -g <= r (since min(r, s) is <=r), and s -g <= s (which is always true).

So the condition s -g <=r.

So for a given h, to check if it's possible, we need:

s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r + g, and s - g <= r.

But since s <= r+g implies that s -g <= r (since s <= r +g => s -g <= r).

Wait no. Wait, s <= r +g â†’ s -g <= r. Exactly. So if s <= r +g, then s -g <= r. So in that case, the interval [s -g, min(r, s)] is non-empty. Because s -g <= r (so the lower bound is <= upper bound). So the interval is valid. So for any h where s <= r+g, the interval is non-empty. Therefore, the maximum h is the maximum possible h where h*(h+1)/2 <= r +g.

Wait, this seems conflicting with previous examples. Let's take r=1, g=1. Then the sum s for h=2 is 3, which is greater than 1+1=2. So maximum h is 1. For h=1, s=1. Then sum_red can be between 1-1=0 and 1. So possible sum_red is 0 or 1, leading to 2 possibilities. Which matches the third sample.

But according to this reasoning, the maximum h is the largest where s <= r+g. So for h=2 in this case, s=3>2, so h=1. So that's correct.

Another example: if r=0, g=3. Then s=3 (h=2) is allowed. sum_red can be s -g =0, which is <=0. So allowed. So h=2 is possible.

So yes, the maximum h is the maximum possible h such that s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g. Then, once h is determined, we need to find the number of ways to assign colors to each level (1..h) such that sum_red <=r and sum_green <=g.

So the first step is to compute h.

Once h is known, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of the levels (each level can be red or green) such that the sum of the red levels' sizes (i.e., the sum of the numbers from 1 to h where the level is red) is <= r, and the sum of green levels' sizes is <=g. But since the total sum is s = h*(h+1)/2, the sum of red levels is sum_red = s - sum_green. So sum_green must be <=g, sum_red = s - sum_green <= r. Which implies sum_green >= s - r. So sum_green has to be in [max(s - r, 0), min(g, s)].

Wait, but sum_green can't be negative. So the lower bound is max(s - r, 0). And the upper bound is min(g, s). The sum_green can't exceed s, because that's the total sum.

So for each possible sum_green in [a, b] where a = max(s - r, 0), b = min(g, s), we need to count the number of subsets of the levels (each level assigned to red or green) that sum up to sum_green.

But wait, sum_green is the sum of the sizes of the levels assigned to green. For example, if a level of size k is green, it contributes k to sum_green.

So the problem reduces to, given the set {1,2,...,h}, count the number of subsets S where sum(S) is in [a, b], and then sum(S) is sum_green. Each such subset corresponds to a way of assigning the levels in S to green, and the rest to red. But each level must be assigned to either red or green. So each subset S represents the green levels.

But the number of subsets is the number of possible ways. So the answer is the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,h} such that a â‰¤ sum(S) â‰¤ b.

So the problem now is to compute the number of subsets of the numbers 1 to h whose sum is between a and b, inclusive. But how can we compute this efficiently?

Constraints:

r and g up to 2e5. h can be up to around sqrt(2*(2e5 + 2e5)) â†’ sqrt(8e5) â†’ around 894. So h is up to about 2000 (since for h=2000, s=2000*2001/2=2001000, which is larger than 4e5. So the maximum possible h is around sqrt(2*(4e5))= ~894, but let's compute for h up to 2000 for safety.

So for h up to 2000, the sum can be up to 2000*2001/2 â‰ˆ 2e6, but for each h, the sum is h*(h+1)/2. So for h=2000, sum is 2e6. So for each h, the sum is up to 2e6. But for each h, we need to compute the number of subsets of {1,2,...,h} that sum to between a and b, where a and b are calculated as above.

The problem is similar to a knapsack problem: count the number of subsets with sum between a and b. But for h up to 2000, even a O(h^3) approach would be too slow. But h is up to 2000, sum up to 2e6. So a dynamic programming approach with sum as the state may not be feasible for such a sum.

Wait, but the numbers in the subset are 1, 2, ..., h. The sum of these numbers is s = h*(h+1)/2. For a subset S, sum_S is the sum of some numbers. The total possible sum_S ranges from 0 to s.

But the sum can be up to 2e6 for h=2000. So a dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to select a subset of the first i numbers that sum to j. Then the recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j - i]

But for h up to 2000 and sum up to 2e6, the DP table would have 2000 * 2e6 entries, which is 4e9, which is way too big for memory.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: since the sum s is fixed, and the subsets are any subset of the numbers 1..h, we can model the problem as finding the number of subsets whose sum is in [a, b]. Note that each number can be included or not, but their sum is the sum of the subset.

But the sum is up to 2e6, which is big. But perhaps for each h, the sum s is known, and a and b can be computed. Then, the problem becomes finding the number of subsets of 1..h that sum to a value between a and b.

But how?

Alternative idea: the sum of the subset must be exactly in [a, b]. For each possible sum in this interval, we need to count the number of subsets that sum to exactly that value, and sum all these counts.

But again, this is the same as the knapsack problem. But for h=2000, the sum can be up to 2e6, which is impossible to handle with a standard DP approach.

We need a more efficient way.

Wait, but h is up to 2000. Let me think: for h=2000, the sum is s=2001000. So the sum is 2e6. But 2000 steps, each step adding a number up to 2000. So the DP state for h=2000 would require O(s) space and O(h*s) time. For 2e6 sum and 2e3 h, that's 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: notice that the sum of the subsets must be between a and b. Since the numbers are 1..h, perhaps we can model this as the sum of the subset can be any value in the interval [a, b], and the problem is to find the sum of the number of subsets for each possible sum in this interval.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Another observation: since each number can be either in the subset (green) or not (red), the total number of possible subsets is 2^h. But this is way too big, but we're only interested in the subsets that sum to between a and b.

Wait, but 2^2000 is way beyond anything.

Alternative approach: since the numbers are 1,2,...,h, perhaps we can find a mathematical way to compute the number of subsets with sum in [a, b]. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: the maximum sum is s, and a and b are between 0 and s. Let me consider that the number of subsets with sum exactly k is equal to the number of subsets with sum s -k. Because for each subset S, the complement subset S' (the other elements) has sum s - sum(S). So the number of subsets with sum k is the same as the number with sum s -k. So perhaps for some ranges [a, b], we can compute the sum more efficiently by leveraging this symmetry.

But this might not help for all cases. But let's see. For example, if a <= s -b, then the sum from a to b is equal to the sum from s -b to s -a. So perhaps we can compute the sum for the smaller of the two ranges and double it, but I'm not sure.

But how to use this to compute the total? Let me think.

Suppose we can compute the number of subsets with sum <=x. Then the answer is the number of subsets with sum <=b minus the number of subsets with sum <a.

But how to compute the number of subsets with sum <=x?

Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming, but optimize it.

But the standard approach is O(h*s), which is not feasible for h=2000 and s=2e6.

Alternative approach: use a bitset to track possible sums, and use bitwise operations to compute the possible sums.

But even with bitsets, for sum up to 2e6, the bitset would require 2e6 bits, which is about 250 KB, which is manageable. For h=2000, we can process each number, and update the bitset by ORing with itself shifted by the current number, then OR with the previous bitset.

This way, each step is O(1) in terms of bit operations, but the bitset size is manageable.

Yes, this seems possible. Let me think.

Initialize a bitset of size s+1, where each bit represents whether a sum is achievable. Initially, the bitset has only the 0th bit set. Then, for each number i from 1 to h, update the bitset by ORing it with (bitset << i). This way, after processing all numbers, the bitset will have 1s in all positions corresponding to sums that can be formed by subsets.

Once the bitset is built, we can iterate through the bits and count how many are set between a and b inclusive.

But with h=2000 and s=2e6, the bitset would require 2e6 bits, which is 250KB. For each of the h steps, we need to perform a shift and OR. This is feasible.

In Python, handling bitsets of this size is possible with integers, but for 2e6 bits, it's manageable. Wait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, and bitwise operations are possible. So perhaps we can model the bitset as a single integer, where the k-th bit represents whether sum k is possible.

Yes. Let's see.

Initialize the bitset as 1 (binary ...0001), representing sum 0 is possible.

For each number i in 1..h:

    bitset |= bitset << i

After processing all numbers, the bitset has bits set for all possible subset sums.

Then, the count is the number of set bits between a and b inclusive.

But for h=2000, each iteration would take O(1) operations (bitwise OR and shift), but the shifts would be O(1) in Python. However, for large shifts (i up to 2000), and with bitsets up to 2e6 bits, the time may still be acceptable.

But in Python, handling very large integers (like 2e6 bits) can be slow. Let's test with code.

But for the problem constraints, h is up to about 2000, and the maximum sum is 2e6. So each iteration would take O(1) time in terms of bit operations, but the actual time depends on the Python implementation's handling of large integers.

But 2000 steps, each involving a left shift and OR, for a bitset of 2e6 bits. Let's see: each left shift by i bits is O(1) in Python, but under the hood, the integer's bits are being manipulated. For a 2e6-bit integer, each shift is O(1) in Python, but how efficient is it?

Alternatively, for h=2000, the sum s is up to 2000*2001/2 = 2001000. So the maximum possible sum is 2,001,000. So the bitset would require 2,001,001 bits. So the maximum value of the bitset is a number with 2e6 bits. Python can handle this, but the question is about the performance.

In the worst case, for each of the h steps, we need to shift the bitset by i and OR with itself. So for i from 1 to h, which for h=2000, that's 2000 iterations.

But for each iteration, the bitset is a very large integer. Let's see:

Start with bitset = 1 (sum 0 is possible).

For i=1:

    bitset = 1 | (1 << 1) â†’ 0b11 (sums 0 and 1).

For i=2:

    bitset = 0b11 | (0b11 << 2) â†’ 0b11 | 0b1100 â†’ 0b1111. So possible sums are 0,1,2,3.

And so on.

So for each step, the number of bits in the bitset increases by up to i bits. So after h steps, the maximum sum is s = h*(h+1)/2, and the bitset has s+1 bits.

So the total number of bits is manageable, but in Python, the time for each shift and OR could be a problem.

Alternative idea: optimize the bitset. Since the numbers are 1,2,...,h, perhaps there's a way to compute the possible sums more efficiently, but I'm not sure.

But given that the maximum h is around 2000, and each iteration is O(1) in terms of operations, this approach may be feasible.

So the steps are:

1. Compute h as the maximum possible such that h*(h+1)/2 <= r+g. This can be done via binary search.

   How? Let's compute h via binary search between low=0 and high=200000 (since r and g can be up to 2e5 each, sum up to 4e5. So h*(h+1)/2 <=4e5 â†’ h^2 ~ 8e5 â†’ h ~ 894). So binary search from low=0 to high=2e5.

   For each mid, compute s=mid*(mid+1)//2. If s <= r+g â†’ possible, check higher. Else, check lower.

   Once h is found, check whether h is indeed the maximum. For example, after binary search, check if h+1 is possible. But binary search should find the maximum h where s <= r+g.

2. Once h is determined, compute a and b, where a = max(s - r, 0), and b = min(g, s).

   Because sum_green must be >= s -r (since sum_red = s - sum_green <= r â†’ sum_green >= s - r) and sum_green <=g.

3. Compute the number of subsets of 1..h that sum to a value between a and b, inclusive.

   This is done via the bitset approach. Initialize bitset as 1. For each i in 1 to h, update bitset |= bitset << i. Then, count the number of set bits between a and b.

But how to count the number of set bits in a certain range in Python?

Once we have the bitset as an integer, we can iterate from a to b, check if the bit is set, and sum the count. However, for a and b up to 2e6, this could take O(2e6) time for each test case, which may be acceptable.

But how to make it efficient? For example, for a=5 and b=2e6, iterating through each bit from 5 to 2e6 and checking if it's set would take O(2e6) steps. Which is about 2 million operations. That's manageable, as Python can handle that in under a second.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, in Python, the bin() function returns a binary string, but for large integers, this is not feasible. Alternatively, using bitwise operations to check each bit.

But for the given constraints, even iterating from a to b is acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Compute h via binary search.

- Compute s = h*(h+1)/2.

- Compute a and b.

- If a > b â†’ no possible subsets, answer is 0. But according to previous reasoning, h is the maximum possible, so a <=b.

- Generate all possible subset sums using the bitset approach.

- Count the number of bits set between a and b inclusive.

But how to handle the bitset in Python efficiently?

Yes. Let's code this.

So, in code:

First, binary search for h.

Then, compute a and b.

Then, compute the bitset.

Then, count the number of bits set in [a, b].

But let's code the bitset.

In Python, we can represent the bitset as an integer. Starting with 1 (binary ...0001). For each i in 1..h, we do:

bitset |= bitset << i

This will track all possible subset sums.

Then, to count the number of set bits between a and b:

count = 0

for k in range(a, b+1):

    if (bitset >> k) & 1:

        count +=1

return count % MOD

But for a=0 and b=2e6, this loop will take 2e6 iterations, which may be acceptable. For example, in Python, even 2e6 iterations are manageable in under 1 second.

But with h=2000 and s=2e6, the bitset may take O(2000 * 2e6) operations. Wait, each step (for each i) involves shifting the bitset left by i and OR with itself. For i=2000, the shift is 2000 bits. So each step is O(1) in Python, but the underlying operations take time proportional to the number of bits in the integer.

But in Python, integers are arbitrary-precision, so shifting by i bits for a large integer could take O(number of bits) time. For example, shifting a 2e6-bit integer by 2000 bits would take O(2e6) time. So for h=2000 steps, each with O(2e6) time, the total time would be O(4e6 * 2000) = 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.

This is a problem.

So, the bitset approach in Python is not feasible for h=2000, as the time for each step would be O(s) for each i, leading to O(h*s) time, which is 2000*2e6=4e9 operations, which is way beyond the time limit.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. So, we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: dynamic programming with a list (array) of booleans, but optimized for space and time.

But even with a list, for h=2000 and sum up to 2e6, it's not feasible. The DP array would require O(s) space, and for each i, we have to iterate through the possible sums.

But perhaps using a bitmask (like a list of booleans) and updating it in place.

Let me think. For example, initialize a list dp where dp[k] is True if sum k is possible, else False.

Initialize dp[0] = True.

For each i in 1 to h:

    for k in range(current_max_sum, -1, -1):

        if dp[k] is True:

            if k + i <= s:

                dp[k+i] = True

But this is O(h*s), which for h=2000 and s=2e6 is 4e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

Alternative approach: use a boolean array and bitset-like operations with bit manipulation. But again, in Python, this may not be efficient.

Alternative Idea:

Since the numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., h, perhaps there's a way to model the possible sums combinatorially.

But I'm not sure. For example, the possible subset sums are all integers from 0 to s, but some are not possible. For example, sum of 1 is possible (take the first element), sum of 2 is possible (take the second element), etc.

But there's no obvious pattern.

Alternative Idea:

The problem requires the number of subsets with sum in [a, b]. For h up to 2000, perhaps we can use memoization and recursion with some optimizations. But even that may not be feasible.

Wait, but the numbers are 1, 2, ..., h. So the problem is similar to partitioning the set into two subsets (red and green), where the sum of the green subset is between a and b.

So the green sum must be in [a, b].

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, note that the sum of green is s_red = sum of red levels, and sum_red <= r. So sum_green = s - sum_red >= s - r. So sum_green must be >= max(s - r, 0) and <= min(g, s).

So the count is the number of subsets with sum in [a, b], where a = max(s - r, 0), b = min(g, s).

But how to compute this count.

Another observation: the sum of all elements is s. So the sum_green can be any value between 0 and s. The count of subsets with sum_green in [a, b] is the same as the count of subsets with sum_red in [s - b, s - a], because sum_red = s - sum_green.

But this may help in cases where the [a, b] interval is large. For example, if a is 0 and b is large, but s - b is small, then perhaps we can compute the count for sum_red in [s - b, s - a] and get the same result.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternative Idea: for each possible sum_green, the number of subsets that sum to sum_green is equal to the number of ways to partition the numbers 1..h into two subsets (green and red) with sum_green = sum. But the problem is to count the total number of such subsets.

But again, this brings us back to the original problem of counting the subsets.

Another Idea: the numbers are 1..h. The sum of subsets of these numbers is known to have certain properties. For example, the number of subsets with sum k is equal to the number of subsets with sum s -k. So the total number of subsets with sum in [a, b] is the same as the number of subsets with sum in [s - b, s - a].

So if [a, b] is larger than [s - b, s - a], we can compute the smaller interval and use symmetry.

For example, if a <= s -b, then the sum of the counts in [a, b] is equal to the sum of the counts in [s -b, s -a]. So we can compute whichever interval is smaller.

This could reduce the number of checks. For example, if a is 0 and b is large, then s -b could be small, and the interval [s -b, s -a] could be smaller than [a, b].

But how to compute the counts for the interval.

But even with this, we still need to find a way to compute the counts.

Hmm. Let me think again.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible approach is to use the dynamic programming approach with a list of booleans, but optimized for space.

But how to manage this in Python.

Wait, perhaps using a bitmask (a list of bits) and using bitwise operations. But in Python, we can represent the bitmask as an integer. For example, initially, the bitmask is 1 (binary 0...01), which represents sum 0 is possible.

For each number i in 1 to h:

    bitmask |= bitmask << i

This is the same as the bitset approach. But the problem is that for large i and large bitmask, this operation is slow.

But maybe in Python, using integers and bitwise operations is the fastest way.

So let's proceed.

For example, in code:

h = ... computed via binary search.

s = h * (h + 1) // 2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    # compute number of subsets with sum between a and b.

    bits = 1

    for i in range(1, h + 1):

        bits |= bits << i

    count = 0

    for k in range(a, b + 1):

        if (bits >> k) & 1:

            count += 1

    print(count % MOD)

But this code will not work for large h and s because the bits variable becomes huge and the shift operations are too slow.

Alternative Idea: Use a bitmask implemented as a bytearray or array of integers, where each bit represents a possible sum. For example, using a list of integers where each integer represents a block of bits. But this is complicated and may not be feasible in Python.

Another Idea: Since the numbers are consecutive, perhaps the possible subset sums have a certain structure. For example, the possible subset sums after including numbers up to i are the sums that can be formed by any combination of 1..i. But I'm not aware of any specific pattern for this.

Alternative Idea: Note that the numbers are 1,2,...,h. The sum of these numbers is s. So the sum of the subset can be any value between 0 and s. The number of possible subsets is 2^h, but with overlapping sums.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible approach is to use the bitset method but optimize it using bit manipulation and Python's native integers.

But how to make it efficient. Let's think of the bitset as a Python integer, and for each i, compute the shift and OR quickly.

In Python, the left shift and OR operations are handled efficiently because they're implemented in C. So even for large integers, perhaps the code will be fast enough.

Let's test this with an example.

Take h=20. The sum is 210. The bitset would be a 211-bit integer. The code would process each i from 1 to 20, performing a left shift by i and OR with the current bitset.

For h=20, this would take 20 steps. For each step, the number of bits in the bitset grows. But in Python, these operations are optimized, so even for larger h, it may be manageable.

But for h=2000 and sum s=2e6, the code may take a long time.

So, to optimize, perhaps we can use a different approach for small h and a different approach for large h, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum possible h is around 2000, which is manageable. For example, even for h=2000, the code may run in Python within 2 seconds.

Let me do a rough estimate.

Each step i involves a left shift by i bits and OR with the previous bitset. For a bitset of size s bits, each shift is O(s) time, which for s=2e6 is 2e6 operations per shift. For 2000 steps, this is 4e9 operations, which is way too much.

But in Python, the actual time may be much worse.

So this approach is not feasible for h=2000.

Alternative Idea: Prune the sums that are not possible. For example, for each step i, track the possible sums up to the current maximum. But again, this is the same as the dynamic programming approach.

Another Idea: Since the numbers are consecutive, the possible sums after processing the first i numbers is the sum of any subset of {1,2,...,i}. The sum can be up to i*(i+1)/2. For each i, the possible sums are all integers from 0 to s_i (s_i = i*(i+1)/2) that can be formed as a sum of some subset. But how to find this.

But again, this brings us back to the same problem.

Alternative Idea: The problem requires the count of subsets with sum in [a, b]. For this, perhaps we can use memoization and recursion with pruning. For example, for each number i, decide whether to include it or not, and track the current sum. But for h=2000, this would lead to 2^2000 possibilities, which is impossible.

Alternative Idea: The numbers are 1,2,...,h. The sum of the subset must be between a and b. The problem is similar to finding the number of ways to split the numbers into two groups where the sum of the first group is in [a, b]. Let's see if there's a mathematical formula or recurrence that can compute this count.

But I'm not aware of any such formula.

Alternative Idea: Since the numbers are 1..h, the sum of the subset can be represented as a partition problem. For example, the number of subsets that sum to k can be computed using generating functions.

The generating function for the subset sums is the product of (1 + x^i) for i in 1..h. The coefficient of x^k in this product is the number of subsets that sum to k.

But calculating this generating function modulo x^{s+1} would give us the counts for each sum k.

But how to compute this product efficiently.

In Python, perhaps using dynamic programming with a list of coefficients.

For example:

Initialize a list dp of size s+1, where dp[k] is the number of subsets that sum to k.

Initially, dp[0] =1.

For each i in 1..h:

    for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

        dp[k] += dp[k -i]

    # but for large i and s, this is O(s) per i.

So for h=2000, this is O(h*s) operations, which is again 4e9, which is not feasible.

But with Python's speed, even 1e8 operations would take about 10 seconds. So 4e9 is way beyond the time limit.

Thus, this approach is also not feasible.

So, what's the alternative?

Alternative Idea: Since the problem requires the count modulo 1e9+7, perhaps there's a mathematical approach involving combinations or inclusion-exclusion, but I can't see how.

Another observation: the numbers are 1,2,...,h. The possible subset sums are all possible integers from 0 to s, except for those that cannot be formed by any combination. For example, for h=3, the possible sums are 0, 1, 2, 3, 3 (1+2), 4 (1+3), 5 (2+3), 6 (1+2+3). So in this case, the sum 4 is possible by 1+3. So all sums except for those that are impossible are possible.

But for larger h, perhaps almost all sums are possible.

But even if this is the case, it's not clear how to compute the count.

Another Idea: The number of subsets that sum to exactly k is equal to the number of subsets that sum to s -k. So the count for sum k is the same as the count for sum s -k.

Thus, the total number of subsets with sum in [a, b] is equal to the number of subsets with sum in [s -b, s -a].

But which of these intervals is smaller? So we can compute the sum for the smaller interval and multiply by 2, or adjust accordingly.

But for example, if a = s -b and b = s -a, then the intervals [a, b] and [s -b, s -a] are the same. So symmetry.

But if a < s -b, then the intervals overlap and are different.

But even with this, the problem is to find the count for one interval.

But how to compute this.

But again, without the actual counts, this doesn't help.

Alternative Idea: When the numbers are consecutive integers starting from 1, the number of subset sums is the largest possible, so the number of possible sums is s+1. But for h up to 2000, this would be 2e6 possible sums. So for each sum in [a, b], we need to count how many times it can be achieved.

But again, this brings us back to the same problem.

Thus, it seems that the only feasible approach is to use the bitset method, but optimize it in Python.

But perhaps the time is manageable. Let's see.

In Python, for each i, the shift and OR operations are handled in C code, which is fast. So even for large numbers, this may be manageable.

Let's try to code this.

First, compute h via binary search.

Then compute a and b.

Then, compute the bitset.

Then, count the bits.

Let me code this.

First, the binary search for h:

def compute_h(r, g):

    total = r + g

    low = 0

    high = 200000

    best = 0

    while low <= high:

        mid = (low + high) // 2

        s = mid * (mid +1) // 2

        if s <= total:

            best = mid

            low = mid +1

        else:

            high = mid -1

    return best

Once we have h, compute s.

Then, compute a and b:

s = h * (h +1) // 2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    # compute the bitset

    bits = 1

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        bits |= bits << i

    # count bits between a and b

    count = 0

    for k in range(a, b+1):

        if (bits >> k) & 1:

            count +=1

    print(count % MOD)

But for h=2000, this code is very slow. So it's not feasible.

So, what's the alternative?

Alternative Idea: Use a dynamic programming approach with a list of booleans, but in a way that optimizes the time.

Let's try this:

def count_subsets(h, a, b):

    s = h * (h +1) // 2

    dp = [False] * (s + 1)

    dp[0] = True

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

            if dp[k -i]:

                dp[k] = True

    count = 0

    for k in range(a, b+1):

        if dp[k]:

            count +=1

    return count

But for h=2000, this is O(2000 * 2e6) = 4e9 operations, which is way too slow in Python.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Find the maximum possible h where s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r +g. Then, compute the number of ways to color each level such that sum_red <= r and sum_green <=g. But sum_red = sum of the red levels. So sum_red can be anywhere between max(s -g, 0) and min(r, s).

But how to compute the number of ways.

Wait, the problem is that sum_red can be any value in the interval [max(s -g, 0), min(r, s)], and for each possible sum_red, the number of ways to select the red levels that sum to sum_red.

So the total number of ways is the sum over sum_red in [a, b] of the number of subsets that sum to sum_red.

But how to compute this sum.

But the same problem remains.

Another Idea: Since the problem requires the sum of subsets in [a, b], and given that h can be up to 2000, perhaps the only feasible approach is to use the bitset method and hope that Python's bit manipulation is fast enough.

But how to optimize the bitset code.

Alternative Idea: Use a list of integers to represent the bitset, where each integer is a block of bits, say 64 bits (using 64-bit integers). This way, the code can use bitwise operations on smaller integers, which are faster.

But in Python, integers are arbitrary-precision, so this may not be necessary. But perhaps breaking the bitset into chunks can speed up the operations.

But this complicates the code.

Alternatively, precompute the bitset in a way that uses numpy arrays, which are more efficient. But the problem requires that the code reads from stdin and writes to stdout, without any external libraries. So numpy is not allowed.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Use the symmetry of the subset sums to reduce the number of iterations.

For example, if the sum_green is between a and b, and s -b is less than a, then the number of subsets is the sum of the subsets for sum_green between a and b. Otherwise, perhaps use the symmetry to compute the sum of subsets for the smaller interval.

But this requires knowing the number of subsets in a certain range, which we don't have.

Thus, I'm stuck.

Alternative Idea: Realize that for the given problem, the number of valid subsets is the sum of the number of subsets for each possible sum in [a, b], which can be represented as the difference between the cumulative counts up to b and up to a-1.

But to compute the cumulative counts, we need a way to find the number of subsets with sum <=x.

But again, this brings us back to the same problem.

Another Idea: For the numbers 1..h, the possible subset sums are all integers from 0 to s, except for some possible missing values. For example, when h is 3, the possible sums are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So all sums are possible. For h=4, s=10, possible sums are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So perhaps for h >= 4, all sums are possible.

If this is the case, then the number of subsets in [a, b] is simply b - a +1, provided a <= b.

But is this true?

Wait, for h=4, the sum can be 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's see: sum of 1 is possible (select 1). Sum of 2: select 2. Sum of 3: 1+2 or 3. Sum of 4: 4. Sum of 5: 1+4 or 2+3. Sum of 6: 1+2+3. Sum of 7: 3+4, or 1+2+4. Sum of 8: 1+3+4, 2+3+3 (but 3 is only once). Wait, no. For h=4, the numbers are 1,2,3,4. Sum 8 can be formed as 1+3+4=8. Sum 9 is 2+3+4=9. Sum 10 is 1+2+3+4=10. So all sums are possible.

For h=5, the sum is 15. Can we form all sums from 0 to 15?

For example, sum 11: 1+2+3+5=11? Or 4+2+5=11? Yes. Sum 12: 3+4+5=12. Sum 13: 1+3+4+5=13. Sum 14: 2+3+4+5=14. Sum 15: all.

So for h >=4, it seems that all sums are possible. If this is the case, then for h >=4, the number of subsets in [a, b] is simply max(0, b -a +1) if a <=b.

But wait, what about h=4 and sum=7. Is there a subset that sums to 7? Yes: 3+4=7, or 1+2+4=7.

So for h=4, all sums are possible.

If this is the case, then for h >=4, the number of subsets with sum in [a, b] is simply the length of the interval [a, b], provided a <=b.

But is this true for all h >=4?

Let's test h=5:

Sum 1: possible (1).

Sum 2: possible (2).

Sum 3: possible (3 or 1+2).

Sum 4: possible (4 or 1+3).

Sum 5: possible (5 or 1+4 or 2+3).

Sum 6: 1+2+3, 6 not possible (but 1+5=6, 2+4=6, 3+3=6 (but only one 3). So 1+5=6 is possible.

Yes.

Sum 7: 2+5, 3+4, 1+2+4, etc.

Sum 8: 3+5, 1+2+5, etc.

Sum 9: 4+5, 1+3+5, etc.

Sum 10: 1+4+5, 2+3+5, etc.

So for h=5, all sums are possible.

Hmm. So maybe for h >=4, all sums are possible. If this is the case, then for h >=4, the answer is simply max(0, b -a +1) if a <=b.

But what about h=6:

Sum s=21.

Can we get sum 1? Yes (1).

Sum 2: 2.

Sum 3: 3 or 1+2.

Sum 4:4 or 1+3.

Sum 5:5 or 2+3.

Sum 6:6 or 1+2+3.

Sum 7:1+6, 2+5, 3+4.

Sum 8: 3+5, 2+6, 1+2+5.

Yes.

All sums seem possible.

So, perhaps for h >= 1, all sums are possible. But this is not true. For example, h=3:

Sum s=6. Can we form sum 4? 1+3=4. Yes. Sum 5: 2+3=5. Sum 6: all three.

So for h=3, all sums are possible.

Wait, then perhaps for h >=1, all possible sums are possible. But this is not true for h=2:

h=2, sum=3. The possible sums are 0,1,2,3. All sums are possible.

h=1: sum is 1. Possible sums are 0 and 1.

So for any h >=1, all possible sums from 0 to s are possible.

If this is the case, then the number of subsets with sum in [a, b] is simply the number of integers in [a, b], which is max(0, b -a +1).

But this contradicts earlier examples. For example, in the third sample input:

Input 1 1. The maximum h is 1. s=1. a = max(1-1, 0) =0. b = min(1, 1) =1. So the interval is 0 to 1. For h=1, the possible subset sums are 0 and 1. So the count is 2, which matches the sample.

Another example: h=3, r=3, g=3.

s=6. a = max(6-3,0) =3. b=min(3,6)=3. So the interval is [3,3]. So the count is 1. But the sum 3 can be achieved by selecting the 3, or by selecting 1+2. So the count is 2, but according to the theory, it's 1. So the theory is wrong.

Ah, this indicates that the assumption that all sums are possible is incorrect.

Wait, for h=3, the possible subsets are:

sum 0: 1 way.

sum 1: 1 way (select 1).

sum 2: 1 way (select 2).

sum 3: 2 ways (select 3 or 1+2).

sum 4: 2 ways (select 1+3 or 2+2, but 2+2 is not possible. Wait, no. For h=3, the numbers are 1, 2, 3. So sum 4 can be achieved by 1+3 (sum 4) or 2+2 (but there's only one 2). So sum 4 can be achieved by 1+3 (4) and 2+2 is not possible. So sum 4 is possible via 1+3, which is one way. Or wait, what about 1+3=4. So sum 4 is possible. sum 4 has at least one subset.

But according to the previous code for h=3, the code would compute the number of subsets that sum to 3 as 2. So the theory is wrong.

So, the assumption that all sums are possible is incorrect. The number of subsets varies for each sum.

So, the initial approach of using the bitset method is the only way, but with h up to 2000 and s up to 2e6, it's not feasible in Python.

Thus, the problem seems to have no solution in Python within the time constraints. But I must find a way.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum h is not that large. Let's compute the maximum possible h for the given constraints.

The sum s = h*(h+1)/2 <= r +g. Given that r and g are up to 2e5 each, the maximum sum is 4e5. So h^2/2 <= 4e5 â†’ h^2 <= 8e5 â†’ h <= sqrt(8e5) â‰ˆ 894. So the maximum h is about 894.

So for h=894, the sum s=894*895/2 = 894*447.5 = 894*447 + 894*0.5 = 400, 218 + 447. Let me compute: 894 * 447 = 894 * 400 = 357600, 894*47=42018 â†’ total 357600+42018= 399618. 894*0.5=447. So total s=399618+447=400,065.

So s=400,065.

So the sum can be up to 400,065 for h=894.

Thus, the bitset for h=894 would be 400,066 bits long. So each shift is 894 bits. Processing each i from 1 to 894.

But even so, in Python, this may be feasible.

Let me estimate:

For h=894, each iteration involves a shift by i and an OR.

The maximum number of bits after processing all numbers is 400,065.

In Python, shifting a 400,000-bit integer by 894 bits would create a new integer with 400,000 + 894 bits, and then OR with the original.

But Python's integers are stored as arrays of digits (in base 2^30 or something like that), so these operations are handled efficiently.

But the time depends on the number of bits. For example, each shift by i would take O(n) time, where n is the number of bits in the integer.

But for h=894, the total number of operations would be:

For each i from 1 to 894:

    bitset = bitset | (bitset << i)

The initial bitset is 1 (1 bit).

For i=1:

    bitset becomes 3 (2 bits).

For i=2:

    bitset becomes 3 | 3 << 2 = 3 | 12 = 15 (4 bits).

For i=3:

    bitset becomes 15 | 15 <<3 = 15 | 120 = 127 (7 bits).

...

After i steps, the number of bits is up to sum_{k=1}^i k = i*(i+1)/2 bits.

So for i=894, the number of bits is 894*895/2 = 400,065 bits.

Each shift by i=894 for the bitset of size 400,065 would take O(400,065 / 30) operations (since Python uses 30-bit digits).

Thus, for each step i, the shift and OR would take O(400k/30) â‰ˆ 13,333 operations. For 894 steps, this would be about 894 * 13,333 â‰ˆ 12 million operations, which is manageable in Python.

But I'm not sure. Let's test with a small example.

For example, h=20:

s=210. So the bitset would have 211 bits.

In Python, the code:

bits = 1

for i in range(1, h+1):

    bits |= bits << i

count = 0

for k in range(a, b+1):

    count += (bits >>k) &1

This code should run quickly even for h=20.

But for h=894, it's possible that the code is too slow.

But given the time constraints (2 seconds), and the fact that Python can handle about 1e6 operations per second, perhaps this code would be accepted.

Thus, the plan is to proceed with this approach.

Now, code:

Read r and g.

Compute h via binary search.

Compute s = h*(h+1)//2.

Compute a = max(s - r, 0), b = min(g, s).

If a > b, output 0.

Else, compute the number of subsets with sum in [a, b], which is the number of bits set in the bitset between a and b.

Implement this with the bitset approach.

So the code would be:

MOD = 10**9 +7

r, g = map(int, input().split())

# Compute h via binary search

total = r + g

low = 0

high = 200000

h = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) //2

    s_mid = mid * (mid +1) //2

    if s_mid <= total:

        h = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid -1

s = h * (h+1) //2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    # Compute the bitset

    bits = 1

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        bits |= bits << i

    # Count the number of set bits between a and b

    count = 0

    for k in range(a, b +1):

        if (bits >> k) & 1:

            count +=1

    print(count % MOD)

But for h=894, the loop over i from 1 to 894 may take a lot of time in Python.

But perhaps the code is optimized enough. For example, in Python, the bitwise operations are very fast even for large integers.

Another optimization: precompute the bitset as an integer and use bit_count for ranges.

But the code counts the bits between a and b, which is O(b-a+1) time. For example, if a=0 and b=400,065, this would take 400k iterations.

But in Python, looping from 0 to 400,000 and checking each bit is very slow.

Alternative Idea: Use the bit_count method but mask the bits between a and b.

But how to create a mask that has all bits set from a to b inclusive.

Once we have the bitset integer, we can create a mask that is ( (1 << (b+1)) -1 ) - ( (1 <<a) -1 ), which is the mask for bits a to b. Then, compute the bitwise AND between bitset and the mask, and then count the number of set bits.

This can be done using the bit_count() method in Python 3.10+.

For example:

mask = ( (1 << (b+1)) -1 ) ^ ( (1 << a) -1 )

result = (bits & mask).bit_count()

This would give the count of set bits between a and b.

This is O(1) time for the bit_count, which is much faster.

So the code can be optimized as:

mask = ( (1 << (b +1)) -1 ) ^ ( (1 << a) -1 )

count = (bits & mask).bit_count()

This would reduce the time from O(b-a+1) to O(1) for the counting step.

Yes, this is a crucial optimization.

Thus, the code becomes:

MOD = 10**9 +7

r, g = map(int, input().split())

# Compute h via binary search

total = r + g

low = 0

high = 200000

h = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) //2

    s_mid = mid * (mid +1) //2

    if s_mid <= total:

        h = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid -1

s = h * (h+1) //2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    # Compute the bitset

    bits = 1

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        bits |= bits << i

    # Create mask for a to b

    mask = ( (1 << (b+1)) -1 ) ^ ( (1 << a) -1 )

    count = (bits & mask).bit_count()

    print(count % MOD)

This code should be much faster, especially for large h.

Now, the only remaining issue is whether the bitset can be computed quickly for h=894.

But with the mask approach, the counting step is optimized, and the bitset step is handled via bitwise operations in C code.

Thus, this code should pass the time constraints.

Let's test it against the samples.

Sample 1:

Input: 4 6 â†’ r=4, g=6.

Binary search for h:

r+g=10.

h*(h+1)/2 <=10.

h=4: 4*5/2=10 â†’ yes.

s=10.

a=10 -4=6. b=min(6,10) =6.

So a=6, b=6.

mask is from 6 to6.

bitset is 1 <<1, then <<2, etc.

After processing 1, bits=0b11.

After processing 2: bits=0b1111.

After processing 3: bits=0b11111111.

After processing 4: bits=0b1111111111111111.

So for sum=6, the bit is set. So count is1.

But the sample output is 2.

Wait, why? Oh no, the code is incorrect.

Wait, sample input 1:

r=4, g=6. The possible ways are:

h=4.

sum_red can be between max(10-6=4, 0)=4 and min(4,10)=4. So sum_red must be 4.

Thus, the subsets that sum_red=4.

The possible subsets are:

- the level with 4 (sum_red=4).

- levels 1+3 (sum_red=1+3=4).

So two possible subsets.

But according to the code, the count is 1.

So there's a mistake.

Ah, because the code is counting the sum_green, which is sum_green = sum_red?

No. sum_green is the sum of the green levels. So sum_green = s - sum_red.

In the sample, sum_red must be 4 (since a=6, b=6 â†’ sum_green must be 6 â†’ sum_red = 10-6=4.

So sum_red must be 4. The code counts the number of subsets of green levels that sum to 6 (sum_green=6). But sum_green is the sum of the green levels. So the code is counting the number of subsets of the levels (1,2,3,4) that sum to 6.

In the sample, sum_green=6 can be achieved in two ways:

- level 6 is not part of the levels. Wait, the levels are 1,2,3,4. sum is 1+2+3+4=10.

Wait, the sum_green is 6. So possible subsets:

- {1,2,3} sum 6.

- {4, 2} sum 6.

So two subsets. So the code's mask is 6 to6. The bitset should have two bits set at position 6. But according to the code, the code returns 1.

But why?

Because the code is using sum_green as the sum, but how is the bitset being computed?

The bitset is initialized as 1 (sum 0). Then, for each i from 1 to h (4):

For i=1:

    bits = 1 | 1<<1 â†’ 0b11. So sum 0 and 1.

For i=2:

    bits = 0b11 | 0b11 <<2 â†’ 0b11 | 0b1100 â†’ 0b1111. sum 0,1,2,3.

For i=3:

    bits = 0b1111 | 0b1111 <<3 â†’ 0b1111 | 0b1111000 â†’ 0b11111111. sum 0-7.

For i=4:

    bits = 0b11111111 | 0b11111111 <<4 â†’ 0b11111111 | 0b111111110000 â†’ 0b1111111111111111. sum 0-15.

So after processing i=4, the bitset has bits 0-15 set. So for sum 6, the bit is set. So the count is 1. But according to the sample, the answer should be 2.

Thus, the code is wrong.

Ah, I see the mistake now. The code is assuming that each number is added once. So the bitset tracks all possible subset sums. But for the subset sums, each number can be either included or not. So the code is correctly tracking all possible subset sums. But in this case, the code produces a bitset where sum 6 is possible, but how many ways?

The code counts the number of subsets that sum to 6. But in reality, the code's bitset only tracks whether the sum is possible, not the number of ways. For example, the code's bitset is 1 if the sum is possible, but the problem requires the number of subsets that achieve that sum.

Wait, this is a critical error.

The problem requires the number of different ways to assign colors such that sum_green is in [a, b]. Each way corresponds to a subset of the levels (green levels) whose sum is in [a, b]. The number of such subsets is the answer.

But the bitset approach tracks the presence of a sum, not the count. Thus, the code is incorrect. It counts the number of possible sums in [a, b], not the number of subsets.

This is a major mistake.

For example, in the first sample, there are two subsets that sum to 6 (sum_green=6). But the bitset only tracks that the sum is possible, so the code would count 1, but the correct answer is 2.

Thus, the initial approach is completely wrong.

This requires a complete rethinking.

The correct approach is to track the number of ways to reach each sum, not just whether the sum is possible.

So dynamic programming is required, but tracking the count of ways to achieve each sum.

So the dynamic programming array should store the number of ways to reach each sum. This is a different problem.

Thus, the code must use a dynamic programming approach where dp[k] is the number of subsets that sum to k.

The recurrence is:

dp[k] += dp[k - i] for each i in 1..h.

But this requires a 1-dimensional array and updating it for each i.

But with h=894 and s=400k, this is feasible in Python if using a list of integers and iterating in reverse.

But for h=894, and s=400k, the list would have 400k elements, and for each i, the code would iterate from s down to i.

But this is O(h*s) operations, which for h=894 and s=4e5 is 894*4e5 = 3.58e8 operations. Which may be manageable in Python, but is tight for the time limit.

But perhaps optimizations can be made.

Let's proceed.

The correct approach:

Initialize dp as a list of zeros with size s+1. dp[0] =1.

For each i in 1..h:

    for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

        dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k -i]) % MOD

Thus, after processing all i's, dp[k] is the number of subsets that sum to k.

Then, the answer is the sum of dp[a..b], modulo MOD.

But for h=894 and s=4e5, this is feasible.

But in Python, this loop may take time. Let's see:

For h=894, and s=4e5, each iteration is 4e5 steps. For 894 iterations, this is 894 * 4e5 = 357,600,000 operations. In Python, each operation is a simple addition and modulus. This may be feasible within 2 seconds.

Let's test this.

Sample 1:

r=4, g=6. h=4, s=10.

a=6, b=6.

dp after processing all i's:

dp[6] is 2.

So the sum is 2.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code should use this approach.

So, the code would be:

MOD = 10**9 +7

r, g = map(int, input().split())

total = r + g

low = 0

high = 200000

h = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) //2

    s_mid = mid * (mid +1) //2

    if s_mid <= total:

        h = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid -1

s = h * (h +1) //2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    dp = [0]*(s +1)

    dp[0] =1

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        # Update dp in reverse

        for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

            dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k -i]) % MOD

    # Sum dp[a ... b]

    result = sum(dp[a : b+1]) % MOD

    print(result)

But for large s=4e5, the sum(dp[a : b+1]) can take O(4e5) time. This is too slow. So we need to precompute the prefix sums.

Thus, we can compute a prefix sum array, where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of dp[0..i].

Then, the sum from a to b is prefix_sum[b] - prefix_sum[a-1].

But with the prefix sum computed after the DP steps.

So code:

...

prefix = [0]*(s+2)

for i in range(s+1):

    prefix[i+1] = (prefix[i] + dp[i]) % MOD

result = (prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]) % MOD

if result <0:

    result += MOD

print(result)

This reduces the sum step to O(1).

Thus, the code becomes:

MOD = 10**9 +7

r, g = map(int, input().split())

total = r + g

low = 0

high = 200000

h = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) //2

    s_mid = mid * (mid +1) //2

    if s_mid <= total:

        h = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid -1

s = h * (h +1) //2

a = max(s - r, 0)

b = min(g, s)

if a > b:

    print(0)

else:

    dp = [0]*(s +1)

    dp[0] =1

    for i in range(1, h+1):

        # Update dp in reverse

        for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

            dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k -i]) % MOD

    # Compute prefix sums

    prefix = [0]*(s+2)

    for i in range(s+1):

        prefix[i+1] = (prefix[i] + dp[i]) % MOD

    result = (prefix[b+1] - prefix[a]) % MOD

    if result <0:

        result += MOD

    print(result)

Now, this code should handle the first sample correctly.

In the first sample, after processing h=4:

dp[6] is 2. So prefix[7] - prefix[6] = 2.

Thus, the output is 2.

This is correct.

Thus, this code should be correct.

But for h=894 and s=4e5, the code's inner loop is 4e5 steps per i. For 894 i's, this is 894*4e5=357,600,000 operations.

In Python, each operation is a simple addition and modulus. But even if each iteration takes 0.1 microseconds, 357 million iterations would take 35.7 seconds, which is way too slow.

But this is not feasible.

Thus, we need a way to optimize this.

Alternative Idea: Use numpy for faster array operations, but the problem requires that no external libraries are used.

Alternative Idea: Use a faster loop in Python, perhaps by using a list of integers and pre-initializing.

But Python's for loops are inherently slow for such large iterations.

Thus, this approach is not feasible for h=894.

Alternative Idea: Find a mathematical formula for the number of subsets with sum in [a, b] for consecutive integers.

But this seems unlikely.

Alternative Idea: Use the fact that for the problem, the maximum h is around 894, and the sum s is around 4e5. But even with h=894, the code may not pass in Python.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize the dynamic programming step.

For example, note that the numbers are 1, 2, ..., h. So each number i is processed once, and the DP step adds the ways to reach sum k by including or excluding i.

But the DP step is:

for k in range(s, i-1, -1):

    dp[k] += dp[k -i]

    dp[k] %= MOD

This is the standard knapsack problem approach.

But in Python, perhaps using a list and reversing the loop can be optimized.

Alternatively, using a bitmask to track the counts, but this is not possible since we need the count modulo 1e9+7.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to implement the dynamic programming approach with the optimized code.

But even this may not be feasible in Python.

But let's try to code it and see.

In the first sample, the code works.

Another sample: input 1 1.

h=1, s=1.

a = max(1 -1,0) =0. b = min(1,1)=1.

The DP steps:

i=1:

for k=1 downto 0:

    if k >=i (1):

        dp[1] += dp[1-1=0] â†’ dp[1] =1.

So dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1.

sum from 0 to1 is 2.

But the code's prefix sum would be:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =1 (sum up to 0)

prefix[2] =1 +1 =2.

result is prefix[2] - prefix[0] =2-0=2 mod 1e9+7 â†’ correct.

Thus, the code works for the third sample.

Thus, the code is correct, but the performance is the issue.

In Python, the code is likely to get a time limit exceeded for large h and s.

But according to the problem statement, the time limit is 2 seconds. Let's estimate for h=894, s=4e5:

Each iteration of the inner loop (for k in range(s, i-1, -1)) is O(s) steps. For 894 iterations, this is 894 *4e5 = 3.58e8 steps. Each step is a simple addition and modulo operation.

In Python, each step is about 1e6 steps per second. So 3.58e8 steps would take about 358 seconds, which is way beyond the time limit.

Thus, this code is not feasible for Python.

Alternative Idea: Use a different approach, such as generating the count based on the possible sum ranges and the fact that the numbers are consecutive.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Idea: Use the fact that for the given numbers 1,2,...,h, the number of subsets that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets that sum to s -k. Thus, the total number of subsets with sum in [a, b] is the same as the number of subsets with sum in [s -b, s -a].

But this doesn't help with the count.

Another Idea: The number of subsets that sum to k is the same as the number of subsets that sum to s -k. Thus, the count for [a, b] is the same as the count for [s -b, s -a]. We can compute the smaller of the two intervals and multiply by 2, but only if the intervals are symmetric.

But this is not always possible.

But in cases where a <= s -b, we can compute the count for [a, s -b] and multiply by 2.

But this is not generally applicable.

Thus, this approach may not help.

Thus, the problem seems unsolvable in Python within the time constraints using the correct approach. However, the code must be written.

But perhaps the code can be optimized in Python using a more efficient way to compute the DP.

For example, using a pre-allocated list and avoiding modulo operations inside the inner loop.

But in Python, even with these optimizations, it's unlikely.

Alternatively, precompute the DP for each i in a way that uses bitmasking for the possible sums, but track the count modulo 1e9+7. But this is not feasible.

Thus, the code is correct but may not pass time constraints in Python for large inputs. However, given the problem statement requires a solution, the correct code is the dynamic programming approach.

Thus, the final code is as follows.
