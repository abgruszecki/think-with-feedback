Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of taxis required for groups of schoolchildren. Each taxi can carry at most four people, and each group must stay together. So the groups can't be split into different taxis, but multiple groups can share a taxi as long as their total doesn't exceed four.

Let me think about the approach. Let's see the examples. In the first example, the groups are 1,2,4,3,3. The output is 4. So the 4 goes alone (needs one taxi). The two 3s each can't pair with anyone else except 1. So one 3 takes a taxi alone (maybe not?), but wait, wait. Let's see the explanation. The fourth and fifth groups (3 and 3) each take their own taxi. Then the first and second (1 and 2) are combined into one taxi. Wait, 1+2=3, which is under 4, so that's one taxi. Then the 4 is one, the two 3s each take one. So total 4.

Wait, but maybe combining 3 with 1. Because 3+1=4. So for each group of 3, if there's a 1 left, they can share. Similarly, groups of 2 can pair up (two 2s make 4). Groups of 1 can be grouped into fours. So the strategy is to count how many groups of each size (1, 2, 3, 4) there are, then find how to optimally pair them.

Let's break it down:

- Groups of 4: each needs one taxi. So count4 = number of groups of 4. Add count4 to the total.

For groups of 3: each group of 3 can take a taxi, but if there's a group of 1, they can share. So for each group of 3, we can pair with a group of 1. So the number of taxis for 3s is count3, but each such taxi can take one 1. So we should take the minimum of count3 and count1. Let's say, for each group of 3, if there's a 1 available, use one 1 and one 3 in a taxi, and reduce the count1 by 1. So the taxis from 3s would be count3 (since each 3 needs a taxi, but possibly with a 1). So the total taxis for 3s is count3, and then the remaining 1s are adjusted.

Wait, but 3+1=4. So each 3 can take a 1. So the number of 1s used here is count3 (each 3 takes one 1, if possible). So after handling 3s, the count1 is max(0, count1 - count3). Then the 3s are all handled.

For groups of 2: Each group of 2 can pair with another group of 2. So each pair of 2s takes one taxi. So the number of taxis for 2s is (count2 +1) //2 (since 2 groups of 2 take one taxi). But wait, two 2s make 4, so that's one taxi. If there's an odd number of 2s, one 2 will be left. Then, that remaining 2 can take up to two 1s (since 2+2=4, but maybe 2+1+1=4). Wait, but 2 + 1+1 would sum to 4, but that would take a group of 2 and two 1s. So after handling the 2s in pairs, if there's a remaining 2 (count2 is odd), then we can use one taxi for that 2 and up to two 1s.

Then, after handling the 2s, what's left is 1s. The remaining 1s can be grouped into 4 per taxi. So (count1 +3) //4.

But let's structure this step by step.

So the algorithm could be:

1. Count the number of groups of each size (count1, count2, count3, count4).

2. Initialize taxis as count4.

3. Add count3 to taxis. Each group of 3 takes one taxi. Then, subtract as many 1s as possible: the 1s that can pair with 3s. So the 1s are reduced by min(count3, count1). For example, if there are more 3s than 1s, then all 1s are used up. If there are more 1s, then count3 are used.

So taxis += count3

count1 -= min(count3, count1)

4. Handle groups of 2. Each pair of 2s takes one taxi. The number of pairs is count2 // 2. So taxis += (count2 // 2). Then, if there's a remaining 2 (count2 is odd), then we need one more taxi. Also, this remaining 2 can take up to two 1s. So:

taxis += count2 // 2

remaining_2 = count2 % 2

if remaining_2:
    taxis += 1
    # take up to two 1s
    count1 -= min(2, count1)

5. Then handle the remaining 1s. Each taxi can take up to four. So taxis += (count1 +3) //4

But wait, after step 4, after handling the remaining 2 (if any), the 1s are reduced by up to 2. Then, the remaining 1s are grouped into 4s.

So putting all this together:

taxis = count4

taxis += count3

count1 = max(0, count1 - count3)  # each 3 takes one 1 if available

taxis += count2 // 2

remaining_2 = count2 % 2

if remaining_2:
    taxis +=1
    # take up to two 1s
    count1 -= 2
    count1 = max(count1, 0)  # in case it goes negative

taxis += (count1 +3) //4

But wait, let's test this logic against the examples.

First example:

Input groups: 1,2,4,3,3 → counts are count1=1, count2=1, count3=2, count4=1.

Step 1: taxis = 1 (from 4s)

Step 2: add count3 (2) → taxis=3. Then count1 = 1 - 2 → but since min(2,1) is 1, so count1 becomes 0. So after this step, count1=0.

Step3: count2 is 1. count2//2 is 0. So taxis remains 3. remaining_2 is 1. So taxis +=1 → 4. Then subtract min(2, 0) → 0. So count1 is 0.

Step4: 0 //4 → 0. So total taxis 4. Which matches the example.

Second example:

Input: 2,3,4,4,2,1,3,1 → groups are 2,3,4,4,2,1,3,1.

Count1: 2, count2: 2 (two groups of 2?), wait:

Wait the input is 2 3 4 4 2 1 3 1.

So the groups are:

s1=2, s2=3, s3=4, s4=4, s5=2, s6=1, s7=3, s8=1.

So count1=2, count2=2 (s1, s5), count3=2 (s2, s7), count4=2 (s3, s4).

Processing:

taxis = 2 (count4)

taxis += count3 (2) → 4. count1 = 2 - 2 = 0.

count2 is 2 → //2 is 1. taxis +=1 → 5. remaining_2 is 0. So no remaining_2.

Then remaining 1s are 0. So taxis remains 5. Which matches the example.

Another test case: let's say groups are [3,1,1,1]. count3=1, count1=3.

Step2: taxis +=1 (count3). count1 becomes 3-1=2. Then handle 2s (count2=0). Then remaining 1s: 2 → (2+3)/4=0.5 → ceiling is 1. So total taxis 1+1+0+0 +1=3? Or wait:

Wait initial taxis is 0 (no 4s). Then count3 is 1 → taxis becomes 1. count1 is 3 -1 = 2. Then count2 is 0 → taxis +=0. remaining_2=0. Then count1 is 2 → (2 +3)/4 = 0.5 → rounded up to 1. So taxis +=1. Total 1+0+1=2. But wait:

Wait the 3 and one 1 take a taxi (4). Then the remaining two 1s take another taxi. So total 2 taxis, which is correct. So the algorithm works.

Another example: groups of [3,3,1,1]. count3=2, count1=2.

Step2: taxis +=2. count1=2-2=0. So each 3 takes a 1. Then, no remaining 1s. Then handle 2s: none. Then remaining 1s: 0. Total taxis 2. Which is correct.

Another case: groups [2,2,2]. count2=3. So count2//2 =1 (since 3//2=1), remaining_2=1. So taxis +=1, then +1 for remaining_2. Then the remaining_2 can take up to two 1s. But count1 is 0. So taxis is 1+1 =2. Each pair of 2s is a taxi: 2+2=4, and the remaining 2 takes another. So total 2 taxis. Which is correct.

Another case: groups [2,1,1,1,1]. So count2=1, count1=4. 

Step3: count2//2 is 0. remaining_2=1. taxis +=0, then +1. Then subtract 2 1s (count1 becomes 4-2=2). Then remaining 1s:2 → (2+3)/4=1.25 → 1. So total taxis is 0 (count4) + 0 (count3) +0 (count3 steps) +0 (count2//2) +1 (remaining_2) +1 (remaining 1s) → total 2. 

The 2 and two 1s (sum 4) in one taxi. Then the remaining two 1s in another. So total 2. Correct.

So the algorithm seems to handle these cases.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

The steps:

1. Read n.

2. Read the list of s_i.

3. Count the occurrences of 1, 2, 3, 4.

4. Apply the algorithm.

Edge Cases:

What if n=0? But according to constraints, n is at least 1.

What if all groups are 1s. For example, 5 groups of 1. So count1=5. The total taxis would be (5 +3)/4 = 8/4=2. So 2 taxis.

Another case: groups [3,3,1]. count3=2, count1=1. Then, after handling 3s: taxis +=2. count1 becomes 1-2 → but we can take min(2,1) →1, so count1=0. Then handle 2s: no. remaining 1s:0. So taxis is 2.

But the groups would be 3 and 1 in one taxi (but each 3 can take one 1). Wait, wait, in the initial step, when we add count3 to taxis, each 3 takes a taxi. But if there is a 1 available, they can take one. So in this example, first 3 is paired with 1 (taxi 1), then the second 3 has no 1 left, so needs a taxi. So total 2 taxis. Correct.

So the code.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

s = list of integers.

count1 = s.count(1)

count2 = s.count(2)

count3 = s.count(3)

count4 = s.count(4)

Then apply the steps:

taxis = count4

taxis += count3

count1 = max(0, count1 - count3)

# handle groups of 2

taxis += count2 // 2

remaining_2 = count2 % 2

if remaining_2:

    taxis += 1

    count1 = max(count1 -2, 0)

# handle remaining 1s

taxis += (count1 +3) //4

So the code.

Wait, but for remaining_2, when we subtract 2 from count1, we need to make sure not to go below zero.

Yes, using max(count1 -2, 0).

Test case:

groups [2,1,1]. count2=1, count1=2.

remaining_2=1 → taxis +=1. count1 becomes 0. Then remaining 1s is 0. So taxis is 1 (from 2//2=0) +1 (remaining_2) → plus initial counts.

So code.

So putting it all together.

Sample input 1:

5

1 2 4 3 3 → counts are 1,1,2,1.

taxis starts at 1.

Add count3 (2) → taxis=3.

count1 = 1-2=0.

count2 is 1 → //2 is 0. taxis remains 3.

remaining_2=1. taxis +=1 → 4.

count1 is 0-2=0 (but since it was 0, it stays 0).

Then, (0 +3)/4=0. So taxis 4. Correct.

Sample input 2:

8

2 3 4 4 2 1 3 1 → counts are 2,2,2,2.

taxis starts at 2 (count4).

Add count3 (2) → taxis=4.

count1 = 2-2=0.

count2//2 = 2//2=1 → taxis=5.

remaining_2=0. So no more.

Then, (0 +3)/4=0. Total 5. Correct.

Another test case:

groups [2,2,2,2] → count2=4. taxis +=4//2=2. remaining_2=0. So 0+2=2 taxis. Correct.

Another test case: [2,2,2] → count2=3. //2=1, remaining_2=1. taxis +=1 +1. Then, subtract 2 from count1 (but count1 is 0). Then taxis += 0. Total 2. Correct.

So code seems to handle all cases.

Now, code in Python.

Read n, then the list.

But for large n (1e5), using list.count() four times may be O(n) each time, which is 4n steps. That's acceptable for 1e5.

Alternatively, we can loop through the list once and count.

But in Python, list.count is O(n) each time. So for four counts, that's O(4n). Which for n=1e5 is manageable.

Alternatively, we can do a single pass:

count1 = 0

count2 = 0

count3 = 0

count4 = 0

for num in s:

    if num ==1:

        count1 +=1

    elif num ==2:

        count2 +=1

    elif num ==3:

        count3 +=1

    else:

        count4 +=1

But in Python, even for n=1e5, this is O(n) steps. Which is better than 4 O(n) steps. So better to do this.

But the code can be written either way. For speed, the single loop is better.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    s = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    count1 = 0

    count2 = 0

    count3 = 0

    count4 = 0

    for num in s:

        if num == 1:

            count1 +=1

        elif num == 2:

            count2 +=1

        elif num ==3:

            count3 +=1

        else:

            count4 +=1

    taxis = count4

    taxis += count3

    count1 = max(0, count1 - count3)

    taxis += count2 //2

    remaining_2 = count2 % 2

    if remaining_2:

        taxis +=1

        count1 = max(count1 -2, 0)

    taxis += (count1 +3) //4

    print(taxis, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
8
2 3 4 4 2 1 3 1
""",
            "output": \
"""\
5
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example:

8

2 3 4 4 2 1 3 1 → counts:

count1=2, count2=2, count3=2, count4=2.

taxis=2 +2 =4.

count1=2-2=0.

count2//2=1 → taxis=5.

remaining_2=0. No.

taxis +=0. So total 5.

Yes.

Another case: groups [3,1,1,1] → count3=1, count1=3.

count1 = 3-1=2.

remaining_2=0.

so after processing 3s and 4s, taxis is 1.

Then, handle 2s: count2//2=0. remaining_2=0. So nothing.

count1=2. Then, (2+3)//4=5//4=1. taxis=1+1=2. Correct.

Thus, the code works.

```python
n = int(input())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))
count1 = count2 = count3 = count4 = 0

for num in s:
    if num == 1:
        count1 += 1
    elif num == 2:
        count2 += 1
    elif num == 3:
        count3 += 1
    else:
        count4 += 1

taxis = count4 + count3
count1 = max(0, count1 - count3)

taxis += count2 // 2
remaining_2 = count2 % 2

if remaining_2:
    taxis += 1
    count1 = max(count1 - 2, 0)

taxis += (count1 + 3) // 4

print(taxis)
```
