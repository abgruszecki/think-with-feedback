Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says we need to find the probability that a bitset is 'amazing' according to Andrey's definition. So first, what's an amazing bitset?

From the problem statement, a bitset is amazing if we can flip all the bits using several operations as described. Let's understand the allowed operations. Each operation involves choosing different indices i0, i1, ..., ik where k >=1. The key condition is that the bit at i0 is different from all the bits at i1 to ik. Then, flip all these k+1 bits.

Wait, so in each operation, we select a group of bits where one (i0) is different from the others. Then flipping them all. For example, if i0 is 0 and the rest are 1s, flipping them all would turn them into 1 and 0s. But how does this help in flipping all bits?

The goal is to find the probability that such operations can turn the original bitset into the all-flipped version. But maybe more accurately, the problem says 'flip all the bits using several changes'—so perhaps the operations can be applied in sequence to flip every bit in the bitset. Or maybe, the operations can be used to reach the all-flipped state from the initial state. Hmm, I need to clarify the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the 'amazing' bitset is one where using these operations, you can flip every bit. Wait, the problem statement says "he can flip all the bits using several such changes." So the operations are applied in sequence, each time flipping a subset of bits as per the rules, and after some steps, all bits are flipped. So the question is: for a given bitset, can there exist a sequence of these operations that results in flipping every bit in the bitset.

But how do we model this? Let's think in terms of linear algebra. Each operation can be considered as a vector indicating which bits are flipped (1 for flipped, 0 otherwise). The problem is then whether the all-ones vector (since each bit must be flipped once) can be expressed as a sum (mod 2) of some of these operation vectors.

So the key is to model the allowed operations as vectors in a vector space over GF(2), and check whether the all-ones vector is in the span of these operation vectors.

But what's the structure of the allowed operation vectors?

Let's think about each operation. Each operation vector has 1s in positions i0, i1, ..., ik. The condition is that the bit i0 was different from all others in the initial bitset. Wait, but the operation is dependent on the current state of the bits. Hmm, this complicates things because the allowed operations depend on the current bitset, which changes after each operation.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the allowed operations are not fixed; they depend on the current state of the bits. So the choice of which operation to apply next depends on the current bits. Therefore, this is not a linear algebra problem over GF(2) in a straightforward way. This complicates the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition for the bitset to be amazing is that it's possible to reach the all-flipped state through some sequence of these operations, regardless of the bitset's initial state. Wait, no. The problem statement says that the bitset is generated with each bit being 1 with probability p, and we need to compute the probability that this specific bitset is 'amazing'.

So, for each possible bitset (each possible binary string of length n), we need to check whether it is 'amazing' (i.e., there exists a sequence of operations that flips all bits), and then compute the probability of that event given the bits are generated with probability p.

But how do we model this? The problem seems very challenging. Let's think differently.

Alternative approach: find a condition on the bitset that determines whether it is amazing, then compute the probability that a random bitset meets this condition.

What's the condition? Let's think about the parity of the number of 1s. Wait, each operation flips k+1 bits. Since k >= 1, each operation flips at least two bits. The total number of bits flipped in each operation is even (since 2,3,4,...). Wait, k+1 bits: for example, k=1 → 2 bits, k=2 →3 bits, etc. So the parity of the number of bits flipped in each operation is even or odd? For example, when k is 1 (so 2 bits), the parity is even. When k is 2 (3 bits), parity is odd.

Wait, each operation can flip an even or odd number of bits. So the sum (mod 2) of all bits in the bitset is being changed by each operation. Let's see: flipping an even number of bits will change the parity of the total number of 1s by even, which is 0 mod 2. Flipping an odd number of bits changes the parity by 1.

But the all-flip requires that the total number of bits flipped is equal to n mod 2. For example, if the original bitset has m 1s, then flipping all bits would result in (n - m) 1s. The total number of bits changed is n (since every bit is flipped). So the parity of the sum of all bits (mod 2) changes if n is odd. So the parity of the total number of 1s must be compatible with the operations applied.

But since the allowed operations can flip any number of bits (even or odd), perhaps the parity is not a restriction. Wait, but each operation's parity depends on k+1. So for example, if we can perform operations with both even and odd numbers of bits flipped, then the parity can be adjusted as needed.

But perhaps the key insight is that a bitset is amazing if and only if the entire bitset is not all 1s and not all 0s. Wait, no. For example, in the second sample input where n=1, the output is 0. Because when n=1, the bitset can only be [0] or [1]. To flip all bits (i.e., flip the single bit), we need to perform an operation. But the operation requires choosing i0 and i1, ..., ik. Since n=1, and k >=1, it's impossible. So the only way to flip the bit would be if there exists an operation, but for n=1, there are no possible operations (since you can't choose i0 and other indices). Therefore, the answer is 0 when n=1. So for n=1, it's impossible, hence the probability is zero. Which matches the second sample.

So, for a bitset to be amazing, there must exist a sequence of operations that can flip all bits. Let's think about the necessary and sufficient conditions.

Each operation selects a group of bits where one is different from the others. Then, flipping them all. Let's model what this does.

Suppose the bitset has at least two different bits (i.e., not all 0s or all 1s). Then, perhaps there exists an operation. For example, choose a 0 and some 1s, or a 1 and some 0s.

But how can these operations be combined to flip all bits?

Alternatively, let's think about the possible operations. Let's say the bitset has both 0s and 1s. Then, we can select a group where i0 is a 0 and the others are 1s (if possible). Flipping these would turn i0 into 1 and the others into 0s. Or, if i0 is a 1 and the others are 0s, flipping them would turn i0 into 0 and others into 1s.

But how do these operations contribute to flipping all bits?

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the bitset can be transformed into all 1s or all 0s through some operations. But the problem is to flip all bits. So perhaps the only way to flip all bits is if the original bitset is not uniform (i.e., contains both 0s and 1s). Wait, but the sample input 1 has n=5 and p=1/2. The output is some value, which suggests that even when there are 0s and 1s, the bitset may or may not be amazing.

Wait, maybe the answer depends on whether the bitset has at least two 0s and two 1s. Or perhaps there's a parity condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the bitset is amazing if and only if it's not uniform (all 0s or all 1s). Because if the bitset is all 0s or all 1s, then no operation can be performed. Because for an operation, you need to select i0 which is different from the other bits. If all are 0s, then i0 must be 0, but then the other bits must be 1s, which they are not. So no operations can be performed. Thus, the only way to flip all bits is if the initial bitset is all 0s or all 1s. But then, you can't perform any operations, so you can't flip all bits. Hence, the answer for such bitsets is zero.

Wait, but if the initial bitset is all 0s, then you can't perform any operations. So you can't flip any bits. Therefore, the bitset is only 'amazing' if you can flip all bits via some operations. But if the initial bitset is all 0s, you can't perform any operations. So you can't flip any bits. Hence, it's not amazing. Similarly for all 1s.

So for a bitset to be amazing, it must not be all 0s or all 1s. But wait, the first sample input is n=5, which allows for a non-uniform bitset. The output is 848765426, which is 1/2 mod something? Not sure.

Wait, let's think again. Suppose the bitset is not uniform. Then, can we find a sequence of operations that flips all bits?

For example, let's take n=2. Suppose the bitset is [0, 1]. To flip all bits, we need to get [1, 0]. How?

Each operation must have at least two bits. Let's see:

Current bits: 0,1.

We can choose i0=1 (which is 1) and others being 0. Wait, but the bits are 0 and 1. So i0 is 1 (bit 1 is 1?), but the other bits (i1) would be 0. So the condition is met. Then flipping them would turn both into 0 and 0. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's take n=3, bits 0 0 1. Then, we can select i0=3 (the 1) and the other indices (say 1 and 2) which are 0. So flipping them all would turn them into 1, 1, 0. Now the bitset is 1,1,0. Then, select i0=1 (a 1) and the other indices 2 and 3 (1 and 0). But the other indices must be different from i0. So i0 is 1 (value 1), and the others (index 2 and 3) are 1 and 0. Wait, the other indices must all be different from i0. So in this case, the other indices (2 and 3) have values 1 and 0. So the i0 is 1, which is different from the others. Wait no: the problem statement says that i0's bit is different from all i1, i2, etc. So, for example, if i0's bit is 1, then all other bits in the operation must be 0. So in the case of bitset 0,0,1 (indices 1,2,3), i0 is 3 (bit 1). The other indices must be 0. So, for example, choose i0=3 and i1=1, i2=2. Then flipping all three would turn them into 1,1,0. Then the new bitset is 1,1,0. Now, can we find another operation here? Let's see: in the new bitset, i0 can be 3 (bit 0), and other indices must be 1. So we can choose i0=3 (0) and i1=1, i2=2 (both 1). Flipping them would turn into 0, 0, 1. Not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to reach all-flipped by combining multiple operations.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when the bitset has at least one 0 and one 1, then it's possible to perform operations to flip all bits. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that a bitset is amazing if and only if it's not all 0s or all 1s. Then the probability would be 1 - (p^n + (1-p)^n). But let's see the sample inputs.

Sample input 1: n=5, a=1, b=2. So p=1/2. The probability of not being all 0s or all 1s is 1 - ( (1/2)^5 + (1/2)^5 ) = 1 - 2*(1/32) = 30/32 = 15/16. But the sample output is 848765426, which modulo 1234567891 would be 15/16's inverse. Let's check: 15/16 mod 1234567891. Let's compute 15 * inverse(16) mod 1234567891. inverse(16) is 16^(mod-2) mod mod. The modulus is 1234567891. Let's compute 16's inverse modulo this.

But 1234567891 is a prime? Let's check. Well, 1234567891 is a known prime? Not sure. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the answer can be represented as x/y with y coprime to 1234567891, so the inverse exists.

Assuming that 15/16 is the correct answer for the first sample. Let's compute 15 * inverse(16) mod 1234567891.

The inverse of 16 mod 1234567891 can be found using pow(16, mod-2, mod). Let's compute that.

But the sample output is 848765426. Let's compute 15 * inv(16) mod 1234567891.

But 848765426 is 15/16 mod 1234567891?

Let me check:

Calculate 16 * 848765426 mod 1234567891.

Let me compute 848765426 * 16 = 13580246816. Then divide by mod 1234567891.

But 1234567891 * 11 = 13580246801. Then 13580246816 - 13580246801 = 15. So mod is 15. So 16 * 848765426 mod 1234567891 is 15. So 848765426 is indeed 15 * 16^{-1} mod 1234567891. So the sample output suggests that the answer for the first case is 15/16. Which aligns with the hypothesis that the answer is 1 - (p^n + (1-p)^n).

But wait, the first sample input is n=5, p=1/2. So 1 - ( (1/2)^5 + (1/2)^5 ) = 1 - 2*(1/32) = 30/32 = 15/16. Which matches the sample output.

The second sample input is n=1. Then the answer is 0. Which is 1 - (p^1 + (1-p)^1 ) = 1 - (p + (1-p)) ) = 0. Which matches.

So this suggests that the condition for a bitset to be amazing is that it's not all 0s or all 1s. Then, the probability is 1 - (p^n + (1-p)^n).

But wait, why? What's the reasoning here?

Let's think again. If the bitset has at least one 0 and one 1, can we always find a sequence of operations to flip all bits?

For example, take n=2 and bitset [0, 1]. Can we flip all bits to [1, 0]?

Each operation must select a group where i0 is different from the others. Let's see:

The initial bits are 0 and 1. So we can choose i0=1 (0) and others (i1=2, which is 1). Then flipping them would turn them into 1 and 0. So after one operation, all bits are flipped. So yes.

Another example: n=3, bits [0,0,1]. How to flip all? Choose i0=3 (1) and i1=1, i2=2 (0s). Flip them all: 0 becomes 1, 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0. Resulting in [1,1,0]. Then, choose i0=1 (1) and i1=2 (1) — but wait, the other bits need to be different from i0. So this isn't allowed. Alternatively, after the first operation, the bits are [1,1,0]. Now, choose i0=3 (0) and i1=1, i2=2 (1s). Flipping all three would turn them into 0,0,1. But that's the original bits. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe there's a way to reach the all-flipped bits.

Original bits: 0,0,1. All flipped would be 1,1,0.

First operation: flip the three bits (i0=3, others 0s). Now they become 1,1,0. Done. So yes, in one operation.

So the problem is that if there's at least one 0 and one 1, then you can flip all bits in one operation. But this depends on the configuration. For example, if the bits are 0,0,1, then the operation that includes all three (the 1 and two 0s) would flip all three bits, leading to 1,1,0. Which is the all-flipped state. So in this case, it's possible.

Another example: bits are 0,0,0,1. So to flip all, we need to turn them into 1,1,1,0. How?

First, choose the 1 (i0) and the three 0s. Flipping them all would turn them into 1,1,1,0. Done in one step. So yes.

So whenever there is at least one 0 and one 1, the bitset is amazing. Thus, the answer is 1 - (probability of all 0s + probability of all 1s).

Therefore, the probability is 1 - p^n - (1-p)^n.

Wait, but this seems to align with the sample inputs. So why is this the case?

Because, when the bitset is not all 0s or all 1s, we can find a single operation that flips all bits. Wait, how?

If there's at least one 0 and one 1, then there exists some i0 which is 0 and some 1s, or i0 is 1 and some 0s. Suppose there is at least one 0 and at least one 1. Let's choose i0 to be one of the 0s, and select all the 1s as the other indices. Then, flipping i0 (0) and all the 1s (each becomes 0) and i0 becomes 1. So after flipping, the 0 becomes 1, and all 1s become 0. The total result is that all bits are flipped. Because the number of 1s is at least one, and the i0 is 0, then the operation is valid. So flipping all 1s plus i0 will invert each of them, thus flipping all 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

Wait, no. Let's see: suppose the bitset has m 1s and (n -m) 0s. Suppose m >=1 and (n -m) >=1. Let's pick i0 as one of the 0s, and select all the 1s as the other indices. Then, the operation is valid because the i0 is 0, and the others are 1. So flipping them all: i0 becomes 1, and all 1s become 0. So the resulting bitset has 1 + (n -m) zeros, which is 1 + (n - m) = n - (m -1) +1 = ... Wait, perhaps the total number of 1s after flipping is 1 (the i0) plus the number of 0s that were not flipped. Wait, no: all the selected bits are flipped. So the original bits are i0 (0) and m 1s. After flipping, they become 1 and m 0s. So the total bitset now has (n - m -1) 0s (from the original zeros except i0) plus 1 (i0) and m 0s (from the flipped 1s). So total 0s: (n - m -1) + m = n -1. So there is 1 one and (n-1) zeros. Which is not the all-flipped bitset.

Hmm, that's a problem. So this approach doesn't flip all the bits. So my previous reasoning was wrong.

So perhaps the condition isn't as simple as having at least one 0 and one 1. So maybe there's a different condition.

Let's rethink this. The problem is to find whether there exists a sequence of operations that can flip all bits.

Each operation is a subset S of bits. The operation can be applied only if there exists a bit in S (i0) such that all other bits in S are different from i0. Then, all bits in S are flipped.

The question is, for a given initial bitset, can we choose a sequence of such subsets S1, S2, ..., Sk such that each S is valid (as per the condition) when applied, and the cumulative effect is that every bit is flipped exactly once.

But how to model this?

Each flip is a binary vector (mod 2) indicating which bits are flipped. The allowed operations are certain subsets S of the bits, but the allowed subsets depend on the current bitset.

But since the operations are dependent on the current state, this is not a linear algebra problem. Instead, the allowed operations change dynamically as the bitset changes. This makes it difficult to model.

Alternative approach: find that the only bitsets that are not amazing are those that are all 0s or all 1s. But how?

Let me think of a bitset that has both 0s and 1s but cannot be flipped to all ones. For example, n=3, bitset 0 0 1. As before, we can select the 1 and the two 0s. Flipping all three gives 1,1,0. Which is the all-flipped state. So this is possible.

Another example: n=4, bitset 0 0 0 1. Flip the 1 and the three 0s. Flipping them all gives 1,1,1,0. Which is the all-flipped state. So again possible.

Another example: bitset 0 1 1. Flip the 0 and the two 1s. Result is 1,0,0. Which is not all flipped. Then, how to proceed?

But the original bitset was 0 1 1. The all-flipped version is 1 0 0. So after the first operation, we reached the desired state. So it's possible.

Wait, yes. So in this case, the first operation is valid (i0 is 0, others are 1). Flipping them all gives 1,0,0. Which is the all-flipped state. So yes.

So it seems that whenever the bitset has at least one 0 and one 1, you can perform a single operation that flips all bits. Because you can select all the 1s and a single 0, flip them. Wait, let's see:

Suppose the bitset has m 1s and (n - m) 0s, where m ≥ 1 and (n - m) ≥ 1.

If you select a subset S consisting of all m 1s and one 0. Then, i0 is the 0, and the others are 1s. So the condition is satisfied. When you flip all of them:

- The 0 becomes 1.
- Each of the m 1s becomes 0.

So the resulting bitset will have:

- (n - m - 1) 0s (original 0s not in S)
- 1 (the flipped i0)
- m 0s (the flipped 1s).

Total number of 1s is 1, and 0s is (n - 1). But this is only a single 1, which is not the all-flipped state unless n=1 (but n=1 can't have both 0 and 1).

Wait, this suggests that selecting all 1s and a single 0, and flipping them, turns them into 0s and a single 1. So this operation doesn't flip all bits. So this approach isn't sufficient.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach doesn't work, and the initial hypothesis was wrong.

Alternative idea: the sum of all operations must flip each bit exactly once. So each operation can be represented as a vector, and the sum of the vectors must be the all-ones vector.

But since the allowed operations depend on the current state, this is dynamic. So maybe there's a way to model this as a graph where each state is a bitset, and edges represent allowed operations. Then, the problem reduces to whether the all-ones flipped state is reachable from the initial state. But for large n, this is computationally impossible.

Alternative approach: think about the parity of the number of 1s. Each operation flips k+1 bits, which can be even or odd. So the parity of the total number of 1s can change. The all-flip requires flipping all n bits, which changes the parity by n mod 2. So to reach the all-flipped state, the initial parity plus the sum of the parities of the operations' bit counts must equal the desired parity (which is (initial_parity + n) mod 2).

But since each operation can be of arbitrary size (as long as the conditions are met), perhaps the parity can be adjusted as needed.

But how?

Another angle: Suppose the bitset has at least two 0s and two 1s. Then, perhaps you can perform operations to flip any individual bit. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, if there is at least one 0 and one 1, can we always find a sequence of operations to flip all bits?

Let me try n=2, bitset 0 1. As before, the operation to flip both bits is allowed. So after one operation, we get 1 0, which is the desired state. So yes.

n=3, bitset 0 0 1. As discussed, one operation flips all three bits to get 1 1 0. Which is the desired state.

n=4, bitset 0 0 0 1. One operation: flip all four bits. Because the subset includes the single 1 and three 0s. Flipping them all turns them into 1s and 0 becomes 0, so the bitset becomes 1 1 1 0. Which is the desired all-flipped state.

So in these cases, a single operation suffices.

But what about a bitset where the number of 1s is 2 and 0s is 3 (n=5). For example, 0 0 0 1 1. How can we flip all bits?

Choose a 0 and the two 1s. Flip them. The 0 becomes 1, the 1s become 0. So the new bitset is 1 0 0 0 0. Then, the bitset has one 1 and four 0s. Then, select this 1 and any three 0s. Flip them all. The 1 becomes 0, and the three 0s become 1. The new bitset is 0 1 1 1 0. Then, select the 0 (i0) and the three 1s. Flip them all. The 0 becomes 1, and the three 1s become 0. The bitset becomes 1 0 0 0 1. This is getting complicated. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe whenever there's at least one 0 and one 1, you can perform a single operation that flips all bits. How?

Wait, perhaps by selecting all the 1s and exactly one 0, then flipping them. Let's see:

Original bits: 0 0 1 1. So n=4. There are two 0s and two 1s.

Choose one 0 (i0) and the two 1s. Flip them all. The 0 becomes 1, each 1 becomes 0. The new bitset is 1 0 0 0. Now, there's one 1 and three 0s. But this isn't the all-flipped state. So this doesn't work.

Hmm, so in this case, the operation didn't flip all bits. So what's the correct approach here?

The desired all-flipped state is 1 1 0 0. How to reach there from the original bits.

Alternative approach: perform two operations.

First, select a 0 and a 1. For example, flip the first two bits (0 and 1). Wait, but the condition is that i0's bit is different from the others. So in the original bitset, the first two bits are 0 and 1. So i0 could be the 1 (bit 2) and others (bit 1) is 0. So flipping them: 0 →1, 1→0. The bitset becomes 1,0,1,1. Then, select the 0 (bit 2) and the three 1s (bits 1,3,4). Flipping them all: 0 becomes 1, 1s become 0s. The new bitset is 0,1,0,0. But this is not the all-flipped state.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different sequence of operations.

Alternatively, what if we can select the entire bitset as part of the operation?

Wait, if all bits are 0 except one 1, then selecting that 1 and all 0s is allowed. Then flipping all bits would turn them into 0 and 1s, which is the all-flipped state.

But for a bitset with mixed 0s and 1s, perhaps the way to flip all is to do operations that cover all bits in multiple steps.

But this seems complicated. How to model this?

Alternative Idea:

The problem's answer is 1 - (p^n + (1-p)^n) mod MOD. Because in sample input 1, this gives 15/16, which matches the sample output. Also, sample input 2 gives 0.

But why does this hold? The hypothesis is that the bitset is amazing if and only if it's not all 0s or all 1s. But how?

If the bitset is not all 0s or all 1s, then there exists at least one 0 and one 1. And then, you can perform an operation that flips all bits in the bitset. For example, select all the 0s and one 1. Wait, but no, because in that case, i0 must be different from the others. So if you select a 1 (i0) and all the 0s (others), then flipping them all would turn the 1 into 0 and the 0s into 1s. This would result in a bitset with all 1s except the original 1. So the total number of 1s would be (number of 0s) + 0 (since the 1 becomes 0). But this depends on the number of 0s.

Alternatively, perhaps when the bitset is not uniform, you can perform a sequence of operations to flip all bits.

But how to prove that?

Another Idea:

The problem allows us to perform multiple operations. Each operation can flip any subset of bits that meets the condition. So even if a single operation can't flip all bits, perhaps combining multiple operations can achieve the desired result.

For example, consider a bitset with 0, 0, 1. Let's perform the following:

1. Flip all three bits. This is allowed because the i0 is 1 (third bit) and the others are 0. The result is 1, 1, 0. Which is the all-flipped state. So done.

Another example: bitset 0, 0, 1, 1.

We need to flip all four bits. How?

First, select the two 0s and the two 1s. But the condition requires that i0 is different from the others. So if we select all four bits, then i0 must be either 0 or 1, and all others must be the opposite. But in this case, the bitset is two 0s and two 1s. So it's impossible to select all four bits in an operation, because there's no i0 that is different from all others.

So perhaps another approach. Let's select a subset that is all 0s and one 1. For example, select the two 0s and one 1. Then, i0 is the 1 (different from the others). Flipping them all would turn the 1 into 0 and the 0s into 1s. So the new bitset is 1,1,0. Then, the three bits (assuming n=4) are now 1,1,0, and the fourth bit remains 1. Now, the bitset is 1,1,0,1. Now, select the 0 (third bit) and the three 1s. Flipping them all would turn them into 0,0,1,0. Which is not the desired all-flipped state. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the key is that when the bitset is not uniform, there exists a way to perform operations to flip all bits, but it's not obvious. However, the sample inputs suggest that the answer is 1 - (p^n + (1-p)^n), which implies that the condition is that the bitset is not all 0s or all 1s. So perhaps the initial hypothesis is correct, and the answer is indeed 1 - p^n - (1-p)^n.

But how to prove that any non-uniform bitset can be flipped to the all-flipped state via some operations?

Perhaps the answer is that the bitset is amazing if and only if it's not all 0s or all 1s. If that's the case, then the probability is 1 - p^n - (1-p)^n, which is what the sample inputs show.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Compute the probability that the bitset is not all 0s or all 1s.

2. This probability is 1 - (prob_all_0 + prob_all_1).

3. prob_all_0 is (1-p)^n, where p is a/b.

4. prob_all_1 is p^n.

But since p is given as a fraction a/b, we need to compute ( (b - a)/b )^n for prob_all_0, and (a/b)^n for prob_all_1.

The answer is then (1 - (a/b)^n - ((b - a)/b)^n ), which needs to be computed modulo 1e9+something (but according to the problem statement, the modulus is 1234567891).

But the problem requires that the answer is expressed as x/y mod 1234567891, where y is coprime with the modulus. So, we need to compute the numerator and denominator of the expression and then compute x * y^{-1} mod MOD.

So, let's express the answer as:

answer = (1 - (a/b)^n - ((b - a)/b)^n) mod MOD.

This can be rewritten as:

answer = (1 - [a^n + (b -a)^n] / b^n) mod MOD.

So, the numerator of the expression is (b^n - a^n - (b - a)^n), denominator is b^n.

Thus, the answer is (b^n - a^n - (b -a)^n) / (b^n) mod MOD.

To compute this, we can compute the numerator and denominator modulo MOD, then multiply the numerator by the inverse of the denominator modulo MOD.

But since MOD is a prime number (assuming 1234567891 is prime), we can compute the inverse of denominator using Fermat's little theorem.

But first, we need to compute the terms a^n mod MOD, (b -a)^n mod MOD, and b^n mod MOD.

Given that n can be up to 1e9, we need to compute these exponents efficiently using modular exponentiation (fast exponentiation).

But since the exponents are large (1e9), we need to handle them with pow in Python, which is efficient.

But there's a catch: the modular inverse of the denominator (b^n) must be computed. However, since MOD is 1234567891 (which is a prime number), if b is not divisible by MOD, then b^n and MOD are coprime (since MOD is prime). So the inverse exists.

But in the input, a and b can be any integers with a <= b and 1<=b<=1e5. So MOD (1234567891) is a prime, and b can be a multiple of MOD, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the denominator in the answer is coprime with MOD. So the answer's denominator is coprime with MOD, which implies that b^n must be coprime with MOD. However, if b is a multiple of MOD, then b^n mod MOD is 0, and the inverse would not exist. So the problem statement ensures that the denominator in the reduced form is coprime with MOD. But the user input could have b and MOD not coprime. How?

Wait, the problem statement says:

"It is guaranteed that the answer to this problem can be represented as a rational number x/y, where y is coprime with 1 234 567 891. You need to output such integer z that x ≡ yz (mod 1 234 567 891) and 0 ≤ z < 1 234 567 891."

So the denominator in the reduced form is coprime with MOD. So even if b and MOD are not coprime, the fraction (b^n - a^n - (b-a)^n ) / b^n must have a denominator that can be reduced to y coprime with MOD. But how?

But perhaps in the initial expression, the denominator is b^n, but after simplifying the fraction, the denominator y is coprime with MOD. So the problem ensures that after simplification, the denominator is coprime with MOD. So our code can proceed under this assumption.

But for computational purposes, how do we handle the division by b^n?

The approach is:

Compute the numerator N = (b^n - a^n - (b -a)^n) mod MOD.

Compute the denominator D = b^n mod MOD.

Then, the answer is (N * D^{-1}) mod MOD.

But this is only valid if D and MOD are coprime. However, since the problem ensures that the simplified denominator is coprime with MOD, but the denominator here is D = b^n, which may not be coprime with MOD. So why can we proceed with this approach?

Ah, perhaps the numerator and denominator have a common factor, and when we reduce the fraction to x/y, y is coprime with MOD. But in our case, the denominator after simplification is y = denominator of the reduced fraction. However, when we compute the numerator and denominator modulo MOD, we need to compute (N / D) mod MOD. But division in modular arithmetic requires that D is coprime with MOD. So how can this be done?

This suggests that the code must compute N * inv(D) mod MOD, but this is only possible if D is coprime with MOD. However, the problem statement says that the answer's denominator is coprime with MOD, which implies that any factors of MOD in D must be canceled by N. So in code, when we compute N and D modulo MOD, we can proceed to multiply N by the inverse of D modulo MOD, even if D is not coprime with MOD. But this is only possible if N and D share a common factor that is a multiple of the gcd(D, MOD). But since MOD is a prime, the gcd is either 1 or MOD. So if D is 0 mod MOD, then the inverse doesn't exist. But the problem statement says that the answer is representable as x/y where y is coprime with MOD, which implies that D must not be zero mod MOD. Otherwise, the denominator would be a multiple of MOD, which is not possible. So the problem ensures that D is coprime with MOD, hence the inverse exists.

Wait, but the denominator in the answer is D = b^n. If b is a multiple of MOD, then D mod MOD is zero, making the denominator zero, which is impossible. So the problem's constraints must ensure that b and MOD are coprime. However, the input allows b up to 1e5. But MOD is 1,234,567,891. So for example, if b is 1,234,567,891, then it's a multiple of MOD. But the problem statement says that the answer's denominator is coprime with MOD. So in such cases, the answer must have the denominator y that is coprime with MOD, which implies that even if b is a multiple of MOD, the reduced fraction's denominator is coprime with MOD. So how?

Perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that after simplifying the fraction (b^n - a^n - (b -a)^n ) / b^n, the denominator is coprime with MOD. But how to compute this?

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:

Compute N = (pow(b, n, MOD) - pow(a, n, MOD) - pow(b -a, n, MOD)) % MOD.

Compute D = pow(b, n, MOD).

The answer is (N * inv(D)) % MOD, where inv(D) is the modular inverse of D modulo MOD. But this is only possible if D and MOD are coprime.

But the problem statement ensures that the answer can be represented with a denominator coprime with MOD. So even if D and MOD are not coprime, after simplifying the fraction N/D, the denominator must be coprime with MOD. So the code should compute N * inv(D) mod MOD, but only if D and MOD are coprime. However, how can this be ensured?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should compute N and D, then compute N / D mod MOD as (N * D^{MOD-2}) mod MOD, but this is only valid if D and MOD are coprime. If they are not, then this is not possible. But the problem's statement says it is guaranteed, so we can proceed under the assumption that D and MOD are coprime.

Wait, but in the case where MOD divides b, then D = pow(b, n, MOD) = 0. Then, the denominator is zero, which would make the fraction undefined. But the problem statement says that it is guaranteed that the answer can be represented as x/y where y is coprime with MOD. So this case must not occur.

So, in code, we can proceed to compute D = pow(b, n, MOD), then compute its inverse modulo MOD. Since the problem guarantees that the answer's denominator is coprime with MOD, we can assume that D is coprime with MOD, hence its inverse exists.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute a^n mod MOD.

2. Compute (b -a)^n mod MOD.

3. Compute b^n mod MOD.

4. Compute N = (b^n - a^n - (b -a)^n) mod MOD. Since mod can be negative, add MOD and mod again to make sure it's positive.

5. Compute D = b^n mod MOD.

6. Compute inv_D = pow(D, MOD-2, MOD).

7. The answer is (N * inv_D) % MOD.

But wait, the problem's required probability is:

[1 - (a/b)^n - ((b - a)/b)^n ] = [ (b^n - a^n - (b -a)^n ) / b^n ]

So yes, the code correctly computes this.

Testing sample input 1:

Sample input: 5 1 2.

a=1, b=2, n=5.

Compute:

a^n = 1^5 =1.

b -a = 1. (b -a)^n = 1^5=1.

b^n = 2^5=32.

N = 32 -1 -1 =30.

D=32.

inv_D = 32^{-1} mod MOD.

32 * 38680246 = 1234567872 → 32 * 38680246 mod 1e9+something? Wait, the sample output is 848765426.

But 30/32 mod MOD is 30 * inv(32) mod MOD.

Let's compute inv(32) mod 1234567891.

Using pow(32, MOD-2, MOD).

But MOD is 1234567891, which is a prime.

pow(32, 1234567891 - 2, 1234567891) = pow(32, 1234567889, 1234567891).

But this is computationally heavy. However, in Python, pow with three arguments is efficient.

Once we have inv_D, multiply by N=30 to get 30 * inv_D mod MOD.

The sample output is 848765426, which matches 15/16 mod MOD. Since 30/32 =15/16, which is indeed the case.

So the code works for the first sample.

For the second sample, input is 1 228 239.

n=1, a=228, b=239.

prob_all_1 is (228/239)^1 = 228/239.

prob_all_0 is (11/239)^1 = 11/239.

So answer is 1 - 228/239 - 11/239 = 1 - 239/239 = 0. Which is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's write the Python code.

But first, note that:

- Compute each term modulo MOD.

MOD = 1234567891.

So, the code steps:

Read n, a, b.

Compute MOD = 1234567891.

Compute term1 = pow(a, n, MOD).

term2 = pow(b -a, n, MOD).

term3 = pow(b, n, MOD).

numerator = (term3 - term1 - term2) % MOD.

denominator = term3 % MOD.

inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD -2, MOD).

result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD.

Print result.

But wait, if denominator is zero, this will cause an error. But the problem statement says that it is guaranteed that the answer's denominator is coprime with MOD, which implies that denominator (b^n) mod MOD must be coprime with MOD. Therefore, denominator is not zero modulo MOD, and the inverse exists.

But for example, if b is a multiple of MOD, then denominator is zero. But the problem statement ensures that this cannot happen. So we can proceed.

So the code is:

Read n, a, b.

Compute term_a = pow(a, n, MOD).

term_ba = pow( (b - a) % MOD, n, MOD )

term_b = pow(b, n, MOD)

numerator = (term_b - term_a - term_ba) % MOD

numerator = (numerator + MOD) % MOD  # to ensure it's positive

denominator = term_b % MOD

inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD)

ans = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD

print(ans)

But we need to handle the case where b -a could be negative. For example, if a > b. But according to the input constraints, a <= b. So no problem. Because the input constraints say 0 <= a <= 1e5, 1 <= b <= 1e5, and a <= b. So (b -a) is non-negative.

Wait, no: the input constraints say a <= b. So yes, b - a is non-negative.

Thus, the code is correct.
