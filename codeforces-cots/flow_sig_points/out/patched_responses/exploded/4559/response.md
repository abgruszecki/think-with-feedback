<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The problem is about Bob collecting red envelopes over a timeline from 1 to n. Each envelope has a time window [s_i, t_i], and when Bob collects it (at some x in that window), he can't collect any more until d_i inclusive. So the next possible time is d_i + 1. Also, Bob chooses the envelope with the maximum coins first, and if there's a tie, the one with the largest d, then randomly. Alice can disturb Bob up to m times, which makes him skip that time. The goal is to find the minimum coins Bob can get if Alice uses her disturbances optimally.

Hmm. So the task is to model Bob's collection process with Alice choosing m times to disturb him such that the total coins Bob collects is minimized. And we need to find that minimum.

Constraints are n up to 1e5, m up to 200, k up to 1e5. So time and space efficiency are crucial here. Let's think about how to model this.

First, for each time x (from 1 to n), when Bob is not blocked, he will choose the best possible envelope available at x. Once he collects it, he is blocked until d_i. So between x and d_i, he can't collect anything. Alice's disturbance can make him skip a time x, so he can't collect anything at x, and then resume at x+1.

We need to model the optimal disturbances. Since m is up to 200, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current time and the number of disturbances used, and the next possible time Bob can act.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 200, a straightforward DP could be O(n * m) which is 2e7 operations, which might be manageable, but we need to compute transitions efficiently.

But the key is to model the state transitions. Let's think: the state is (current_time, disturbances_used), and the value is the minimal coins collected so far. For each state, we can decide whether to disturb or not.

Wait, but the next possible time Bob can act depends on his previous action. For example, if he collected an envelope at time x (after possibly some disturbances), he can't act again until d_i+1. So the state might need to track when Bob becomes available again. But if we model the next available time, the state becomes (next_available, disturbances_used), but next_available can be up to n, leading to O(n * m) states. However, next_available is up to n, which is 1e5. So with m up to 200, the total states would be 1e5 * 200 = 2e7. That's manageable, but the transitions need to be handled efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each time x, the best envelope that Bob would collect if he arrives at x. Then, the process can be modeled as jumping through these best envelopes, and the disturbances can be placed to skip certain steps.

So first, for each time x, determine the best envelope available (if any). The best envelope is the one with maximum w, then maximum d, then arbitrary (but since all those are the same, the choice is determined). So for each x, the best envelope is the same regardless of the order Bob collects them, as per the greedy selection.

Once we have this, then the problem becomes similar to intervals where collecting an envelope at x gives w and jumps to d+1. Then, the problem reduces to choosing m times to insert skips (disturbances) so that the sum of w's is minimized.

This seems like a problem where we can model the process with dynamic programming, tracking the current position and the number of skips used.

So, the steps would be:

1. Precompute for each time x, the best envelope (if any) that Bob would collect if he arrives at x. This would allow us to know, for each x, the next time Bob can act (d_i + 1) and the coins added (w_i).

   How to compute this efficiently? Since for each x, we need the best envelope (max w, then max d) that is available (s_i <= x <= t_i).

   Since the envelopes can have overlapping intervals, this is a range maximum query problem. But with the parameters s_i and t_i, which are ranges where the envelope is available.

   To efficiently find for each x the best envelope available at x, we can process all the envelopes and for each x, determine the best one.

   One approach is to, for each envelope, mark the interval [s_i, t_i] and for each x in that interval, include the envelope in the candidates for x. Then, for each x, we can select the best envelope among all those candidates.

   But with n up to 1e5 and k up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n + k), but if each envelope's interval is large, this could be O(k*t_i - s_i +1) which is 1e10 operations, which is impossible.

   Therefore, we need a smarter way.

   Alternative approach: for each x, the best envelope is the one with maximum (w_i, d_i), and we need to find for each x the maximum such envelope that covers x (s_i <=x <=t_i).

   This is similar to a line sweep problem. Here's how to approach it:

   We can collect all the events where an envelope starts (s_i) and ends (t_i + 1), and for each x, track which envelopes are active. Then, for each x, the active envelopes are those where s_i <=x <=t_i.

   But maintaining the active envelopes for each x and selecting the best one is the challenge.

   Here's an efficient way to precompute the best envelope for each x:

   - Sort all the envelopes by their s_i. Then, for each x from 1 to n, we can track all envelopes that start before or at x and end after or at x. But this is still O(nk) in worst case.

   Another approach is to use a segment tree or a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to handle the intervals. For each x, the best envelope is the one with maximum (w_i, d_i) where s_i <=x <=t_i.

   So the problem is to perform a range maximum query over all intervals that include x. But standard range maximum query data structures are for ranges from x to y, but here, each envelope's interval is [s_i, t_i], and for each x, we need the maximum over all envelopes that include x.

   This is a bit tricky. Let's think of each envelope as contributing to all x in [s_i, t_i]. So for each x, we need the maximum (w_i, d_i) among all envelopes where x is in their interval.

   One way to compute this is to use a line sweep. For each envelope, we can add it to the active set when x reaches s_i, and remove it when x exceeds t_i. Then, for each x, the active set contains all envelopes available at x, and we need the maximum among them.

   The maximum can be tracked using a priority queue (heap), but with the envelopes sorted by (w_i, d_i). However, when envelopes go out of scope (x exceeds t_i), they need to be removed from the active set. So a problem with the heap is that we can't efficiently remove elements that are no longer valid.

   So here's an alternative approach using a segment tree. For each x, the best envelope is the maximum (w, d) among all envelopes that cover x. To compute this, we can model this as for each x, query the maximum over all intervals that include x. How can this be done efficiently?

   Here's an idea inspired by the sweep line algorithm and a segment tree:

   For each envelope i, we can insert it into the segment tree for the range [s_i, t_i]. For each position in the tree, we track the maximum (w_i, d_i, i) envelope. Then, querying for a single x would give the maximum envelope active at x.

   Building such a segment tree would allow us to query each x in O(log n) time. But with k up to 1e5 and each insertion being O(log n) per envelope, this would be O(k log n) time, which is acceptable.

   So the steps would be:

   - Build a segment tree where each node represents a range of time. For each node, we store the maximum (w, d) envelope that covers any part of that node's range. However, since an envelope covers a range [s_i, t_i], inserting it into the segment tree would involve adding it to all nodes that cover [s_i, t_i]. Then, for a query at x, we traverse the tree from root to the leaf x, collecting the maximum (w, d) envelope along the way.

   Wait, but inserting intervals into the segment tree is a standard problem. For this scenario, each envelope's [s_i, t_i] interval needs to be added to the segment tree, and for each point query x, find the maximum (w, d) envelope that includes x.

   This can be done with a segment tree optimized for range maximum queries with intervals.

   However, implementing such a segment tree can be a bit involved. Alternatively, since all envelopes are known in advance, perhaps we can precompute for each x the best envelope.

   Let's think about the line sweep approach again. We can process all events (envelope starts and ends) in order of x. For each x, when x increases to s_i, we add the envelope to the active set. When x exceeds t_i, we remove it from the active set. Then, for each x, the active set contains all envelopes available at x. The best envelope is the one with maximum w, then d.

   The problem is how to manage the active set efficiently. A possible data structure is a priority queue ordered by (w, d) in descending order. But when an envelope's t_i is passed, we need to remove it from the priority queue. However, the priority queue doesn't support efficient removal of arbitrary elements.

   To handle this, perhaps we can use a sweep line approach where we process each x from 1 to n in order, and for each x, process all the envelopes that start at x (add to the priority queue) and process all the envelopes that end at x (mark them as inactive). The priority queue must only contain envelopes that are still active (i.e., their t_i >= current x).

   So the steps would be:

   1. Sort all the start and end events.

      For each envelope i, create two events:

      - (s_i, 'add', i)
      - (t_i + 1, 'remove', i)

   2. Sort all events by the x value. For events with the same x, process 'remove' before 'add' to handle the end of the interval properly.

      Wait, for example, when x is t_i + 1, the envelope's interval ends at t_i, so for x = t_i, it's still active. So when x becomes t_i + 1, it's no longer active. So the 'remove' event is at x = t_i + 1.

   3. Then, as we process x from 1 to n, for each x, first process all 'remove' events (if any) where the x is equal to current x. Then, process all 'add' events for x, adding the envelope to the priority queue. Then, for x, the active envelopes are those in the priority queue.

   But the priority queue might still have envelopes that have already ended. Wait, no. Because we process the 'remove' events before the 'add' events. Wait, no: the 'remove' event is for x = t_i + 1. So when x is processed in order, at x = t_i + 1, we process the 'remove' event, which removes the envelope from the priority queue. But how do we track which envelopes are in the priority queue?

   Wait, here's the problem: a priority queue can't efficiently check if an element is present. So when we process a 'remove' event for an envelope i, how do we remove it from the priority queue? That's not straightforward. The standard priority queue doesn't support this.

   So this approach might not work. Alternative idea: use a priority queue that stores the envelope's end time. When checking the top of the queue, if the envelope's t_i is < current x, we pop it (since it's no longer active). Then, the top of the queue is the best active envelope.

   So here's the plan:

   - For each x from 1 to n:

     a. Add all envelopes where s_i == x to the priority queue. The priority queue is ordered by (-w_i, -d_i, i), so the largest w_i comes first, then largest d_i.

     b. While the top of the queue has t_i < x, remove it (since it's no longer active). Do this until the top is valid (t_i >=x) or the queue is empty.

     c. If there's an envelope in the queue, then the best one is the top. So for x, the best envelope is that one. Otherwise, no envelope is collected.

     d. Then, when moving to x+1, repeat the process.

   Wait, but how do we handle envelopes that were added earlier but their s_i <= x and t_i >=x, but we didn't process their 'add' event yet?

   For example, an envelope with s_i = 3 and t_i = 5. When x is 3, we add it. For x=4 and 5, it's still active. But when x is 5, it's active. Then, when x becomes 6, the envelope's t_i is 5, which is <6, so when x=6, during step b, we check if the top has t_i <6. If yes, remove it.

   But this approach requires that all envelopes with s_i <=x have been added to the queue by the time x is processed. But how to ensure that?

   For example, an envelope with s_i=3 and x=4: when x is 4, the envelope's s_i is 3, which is <=4. But we only add envelopes with s_i ==x in step a. So this approach misses all envelopes where s_i <x. So this approach is incorrect.

   So this line of thinking isn't correct. We need a way to add all envelopes where s_i <=x and t_i >=x.

   So this suggests that the line sweep approach with a priority queue may not be feasible unless we can find a way to track all active envelopes.

   Alternative idea: pre-sort all envelopes by their s_i, and for each x, add all envelopes where s_i <=x. But even if s_i <=x, the envelope's t_i might be >=x, but how to track that?

   Wait, no. The envelope is active only if s_i <=x and t_i >=x. So when x increases, for x=1, we need to add all envelopes where s_i=1. For x=2, add all with s_i=2, etc. But this would only add the envelopes when x reaches s_i. But once added, they may stay in the priority queue until their t_i >=x.

   But if x is 3 and the envelope has s_i=1 and t_i=5, then it was added when x=1 and remains in the queue. So when x=3, the envelope is in the queue, but when we check if its t_i >=3 (which it is), so it's active.

   So the way to manage this is:

   - Pre-sort all envelopes by s_i.

   - For each x from 1 to n:

     a. Add all envelopes where s_i ==x to the priority queue.

     b. Then, while the top of the queue has t_i <x (so not active anymore), remove it.

     c. Then, if there is an envelope in the queue, collect it (or in our case, determine what the best envelope is for x).

   But this approach would work only for the first occurrence of s_i. For example, an envelope with s_i=1 and t_i=5 is added when x=1, and remains in the queue. For x=2, 3, etc., step a doesn't add anything, but step b checks if the top is still valid.

   Wait, but in this approach, the priority queue contains all envelopes where s_i <=x (since they were added when x reached their s_i) and t_i >=x (since we remove them when t_i <x). So for each x, the priority queue will contain all envelopes that are active (s_i <=x and t_i >=x) and have s_i <=x. So the top of the queue (after removing invalid ones) is the best envelope available.

   So this approach works. Because:

   - Envelopes are added to the queue when x reaches their s_i.

   - Once added, they remain in the queue until their t_i <x. So when x increases beyond t_i, they are removed.

   So for each x, after adding new envelopes (with s_i=x) and pruning the queue (removing those with t_i <x), the queue contains all active envelopes (s_i <=x, t_i >=x). Then, the top is the best one.

   So the steps are:

   1. Sort all envelopes by s_i.

   2. Maintain a pointer (say, j) that tracks which envelopes have s_i <=x and have been added to the queue.

      Wait, no. Because in this approach, for x from 1 to n, when x is processed, we add all envelopes where s_i ==x. So if the envelopes are sorted by s_i, then for each x, we can iterate through the envelopes and add those with s_i ==x.

      For example, the envelopes are sorted by s_i. So for x=1, we add all envelopes with s_i=1. Then for x=2, add those with s_i=2, etc.

   Wait, but what if there are envelopes with s_i=1 and t_i=5. These are added when x=1. For x=2, they are still active (t_i=5 >=2), so they are in the queue. So the queue is maintained properly.

   So this seems correct.

   So the code for precomputing the best envelope for each x would be:

   - Envelopes sorted by s_i in ascending order.

   - Priority queue (max-heap) ordered by (-w_i, -d_i, ...) so that the envelope with highest w comes first, then largest d.

   - For each x from 1 to n:

     a. Add all envelopes where s_i ==x to the priority queue.

     b. While the priority queue is not empty and the top envelope's t_i <x, remove it.

     c. If the queue is not empty, the best envelope is the top. Record for x the w and d of this envelope.

     d. Else, no envelope, so Bob can't collect anything here.

   So this would give us for each x, the best envelope Bob would collect if he arrives at x. But the problem is, after collecting an envelope at x, Bob can't collect again until d_i +1. So the next possible time is d_i +1.

   So the process is: Bob starts at time x. If he collects the best envelope at x, then the next possible time is d_i +1. Then, at d_i +1, he collects the best envelope available then, etc. But Alice can choose to disturb him at any time x, causing him to skip x and proceed to x+1.

   So the problem reduces to a dynamic programming problem where the state is (current_time, disturbances_used) and the next steps depend on whether we disturb or not.

   The DP transition would be:

   For state (current_time, k):

   If current_time exceeds n: return 0.

   Else, two options:

   1. Disturb (if k < m): move to current_time +1, k+1, add 0 coins.

   2. Do not disturb:

      a. If there's an envelope available at current_time (best_envelope exists), then collect it. Add its w_i to the total and move to d_i +1, with k disturbances used.

      b. Else, move to current_time +1, k disturbances used, add 0 coins.

   So the minimal coins is the minimum between disturbing and not disturbing, considering all possibilities.

   The base case is when current_time >n, return 0.

   Now, considering the constraints: n up to 1e5, m up to 200. The DP state is (current_time, m_used). So the total possible states are 1e5 * 201 ≈ 2e7, which is manageable.

   But if for each state, we have to compute transitions and look up the best envelope for current_time, which is O(1) with precomputed data, then the total time is O(n*m), which is acceptable.

   So the steps for the solution are:

   1. Precompute for each x (1..n), the best envelope (w, d) if any.

   2. Implement a dynamic programming approach where:

      dp[i][j] = the minimal coins collected starting from time i with j disturbances used.

      The transitions are:

      For dp[i][j]:

      Option 1: disturb (if j <m):

         coins = 0

         next_time = i+1

         next_j = j+1

         dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], coins + dp[next_time][next_j])

      Option 2: do not disturb:

         if there's an envelope at i:

             coins = w

             next_time = d +1

             next_j = j

             dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], coins + dp[next_time][next_j])

         else:

             coins =0

             next_time = i+1

             next_j = j

             dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], coins + dp[next_time][next_j])

   The base case is dp[i][j] =0 when i >n.

   However, implementing this with a standard memoization approach or a recursive DP may not be feasible due to stack limits. So an iterative approach with memoization using a 2D array is better.

   But for n=1e5 and m=200, a 2D array would require 1e5 * 200 = 2e7 entries. That's manageable in Python as each entry is an integer (assuming we use a list of lists, perhaps using memoization with a DP table where each row is time, and each column is the number of disturbances used).

   However, even 2e7 entries may be a problem in terms of memory. Let's see: each entry is a 64-bit integer (say 8 bytes). 2e7 *8 bytes = 160MB, which is acceptable given the memory limits (256MB per test case).

   But in Python, using a list of lists where each inner list has 201 elements for m up to 200, the total is 1e5 *201 = 2e7 elements. Each element is a number. So in Python, the memory consumption for a list of lists is manageable.

   However, the standard approach for iterative DP would be to fill the DP table in reverse order (from n down to 1), since each state depends on future states (i.e., next_time is larger than i).

   So, to compute dp[i][j], we need to have computed dp[i+1][j+1] and dp[d+1][j] (for the envelope case) or dp[i+1][j] (if no envelope).

   So the approach is:

   Initialize a DP array with dimensions (n+2) x (m+1). For i >n, DP[i][*] =0.

   Then, iterate i from n down to 1.

   For each i, iterate j from 0 to m.

   For each (i,j), compute the two options (disturb and not disturb), then take the minimum.

   The key is to precompute for each i, the best envelope's w and d. Let's say we have two arrays: best_w[i] and best_d[i]. If best_w[i] is 0, then no envelope is available.

   So the code outline is:

   Initialize a DP table with (n+2) rows (from 0 to n+1) and (m+1) columns. Initialize all as infinity except for i >n, which are 0.

   For i in range(n, 0, -1):

      for j in range(m, -1, -1):

          # option 1: disturb (if j <m)
          if j <m:
              option1 = dp[i+1][j+1]
          else:
              option1 = infinity

          # option 2: not disturb
          if best_w[i] >0:
              next_time = best_d[i] +1
              option2 = best_w[i] + (dp[next_time][j] if next_time <=n+1 else 0)
          else:
              option2 = dp[i+1][j]

          dp[i][j] = min(option1, option2)

   So the minimal coins is dp[1][0].

   Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

   Let's take the first sample:

   Input:

   5 0 2

   1 3 4 5

   2 5 5 8

   So precomputing best envelope for each x:

   x=1: available envelopes are first (s=1, t=3, w=5) and second (s=2, t=5, but s=2>1, so not added yet. So best is first. So best_w[1] =5, best_d[1] =4.

   x=2: add second envelope (s=2). Now, the active envelopes are first (t=3 >=2) and second (t=5 >=2). Compare w: 5 vs 8. So second is better. best_w[2]=8, best_d=5.

   x=3: both envelopes are active. Same as x=2. best_w=8.

   x=4: first envelope's t_i is 3 <4, so removed. Only the second envelope is active (t=5 >=4). So best_w=8.

   x=5: second envelope's t_i=5 >=5. So best_w=8.

   So for each x, the best envelope is collected. So when Alice can't disturb (m=0), the DP transitions are:

   i=5, j=0: best_w=8. next_time is 5+1=6>5. So option2 =8 +0=8. So dp[5][0] =8.

   i=4, j=0: best_w=8, d=5. next_time=5+1=6. dp[5][0] is 8. So option2=8+8=16. Disturb option not possible. So dp[4][0] =16.

   Wait, no. Wait, the code says option2 is best_w[i] + dp[next_time][j]. So for i=4, next_time is 5+1=6, which is beyond n=5. So dp[6][0] is 0. So option2=8+0=8. Then, for i=4, j=0: option1 (disturb) is not possible. So option2 is 8. So dp[4][0]=8.

   Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

   For i=5:

   option2: best_w[5] is 8, best_d is 5. So next_time=5+1=6. So 8 + dp[6][0]. Since dp[6][0] is 0, option2 is 8. So dp[5][0] is 8.

   For i=5-1=4:

   best_w[4] is 8, best_d=5. next_time=5+1=6. So option2 is 8 + 0=8. So dp[4][0] = min(option1 (can't disturb), option2=8) → 8.

   For i=3:

   best_w[3]=8, best_d=5. next_time=6. So option2=8 +0 →8. So dp[3][0] is 8.

   Similarly, for i=2: option2 is 8 +0 →8. So dp[2][0] is 8.

   For i=1: best_w=5, best_d=4. next_time=5. dp[5][0] is 8. So option2=5+8=13. So dp[1][0] =13. Which matches the first sample's output.

   So this approach works for the first sample.

   Now, the second sample:

   Input:

   10 1 6

   envelopes:

   1 1 2 4 → envelope 0

   2 2 6 2 → envelope 1

   3 3 3 3 → envelope 2

   4 4 4 5 → envelope 3

   5 5 5 7 → envelope4

   6 6 6 9 → envelope5

   The best envelopes for each x:

   x=1: envelope0 (w=4). next_time=2+1=3.

   x=2: envelope1 (w=2). next_time=6+1=7.

   x=3: envelope2 (w=3). next_time=3+1=4.

   x=4: envelope3 (w=5). next_time=4+1=5.

   x=5: envelope4 (w=7). next_time=5+1=6.

   x=6: envelope5 (w=9). next_time=6+1=7.

   x=7,8,9,10: no envelopes.

   Alice can disturb once. The optimal is to disturb at x=1, which skips envelope0. Then Bob proceeds to x=2, collects envelope1 (w=2), which sets next_time=7. From 7 to 10, no envelopes. So total is 2. So the answer is 2.

   Let's see how the DP works:

   The DP starts at i=10, then goes down to 1.

   For i=10 and j=0 or 1: dp[10][*] =0.

   For i=6, j=0: best is envelope5 (w=9). next_time=7. So dp[6][0] =9 + dp[7][0]. dp[7][0] is 0 (since all envelopes at x=7 and beyond are zero). So 9.

   If we disturb here (j=0 → j+1=1), but m=1, so possible. But let's see the case where we disturb at x=1.

   So the DP for i=1, j=0: options are:

   disturb: j becomes 1, next_time=2. dp[2][1] is ?

   not disturb: collect envelope0 (w=4), next_time=3. So total is 4 + dp[3][0].

   Now, what's the minimal between these two options?

   The optimal is to disturb.

   Let's see how the DP proceeds.

   For the DP table, we need to compute all possibilities.

   However, without getting into the entire calculation, the DP should correctly model the choice of whether to disturb at x=1, leading to a lower total.

   So the approach should work.

   So now, the code steps are:

   1. Precompute best_w and best_d for each x.

   2. Initialize the DP table.

   3. Iterate from i=n down to 1.

   4. For each i and j, compute the two options and take the minimum.

   Now, the code for precomputing best_w and best_d.

   As discussed earlier, we can process each x in order, adding envelopes when x reaches s_i, and using a priority queue that removes envelopes whose t_i <x.

   So here's how to code the precomputation:

   Envelopes are sorted by s_i.

   Then, for x from 1 to n:

       add all envelopes with s_i ==x to the priority queue.

       while the queue is not empty and the top's t_i <x: pop it.

       if queue is not empty: the top is best, so record best_w[x] and best_d[x].

       else: best_w[x] =0, best_d[x] =0.

   The priority queue needs to be a max-heap based on (w, d). So we can store tuples of (-w, -d, t_i, s_i, d_i, w_i) so that the largest w and then largest d come first. Python's heapq is a min-heap, so we can invert the signs.

   Wait, for example, to compare two envelopes, we want the one with higher w first. So we can store (-w, -d) as the key for the heap, so that the min-heap gives the smallest (i.e., most negative) w first, which corresponds to the largest w.

   So the code:

   import heapq

   envelopes = sorted list of (s_i, t_i, d_i, w_i), sorted by s_i.

   Then, for each x in 1..n:

       while the current pointer in the envelopes is <=k-1 and envelopes[ptr][0] ==x:

           push (-w, -d, t_i, d_i, w) into the heap.

           ptr +=1

       while the heap is not empty and heap[0][2] <x:

           heappop(heap)

       if heap is not empty:

           best_w[x] = heap[0][4]

           best_d[x] = heap[0][3]

       else:

           best_w[x] =0

           best_d[x] =0

   So the code for precomputing.

   Now, the DP part.

   We can use a 2D array (dp) of size (n+2) x (m+1), initialized to infinity. Then, for i >n, dp[i][j] =0.

   Initialize dp[i][j] for i >n to 0.

   Then, for i from n downto 1:

       for j from m downto 0:

           option1 = infinity

           if j <m:

               next_j = j+1

               next_time = i+1

               option1 = dp[next_time][next_j]

           option2 = 0

           if best_w[i] >0:

               next_time = best_d[i] +1

               if next_time >n:

                   option2 = best_w[i]

               else:

                   option2 = best_w[i] + dp[next_time][j]

           else:

               next_time = i+1

               option2 = dp[next_time][j]

           dp[i][j] = min(option1, option2)

   So the code for the DP.

   Now, handling the next_time correctly.

   For example, if next_time is greater than n, then dp[next_time][j] is 0, so the coins added are best_w[i] +0.

   So, in code, whenever next_time >n, we just take 0 for that part.

   Now, considering the size of n and m, the DP will be O(n *m), which is 1e5 *200 =2e7 steps, which is acceptable.

   Now, for the space: in Python, a list of lists for dp. But n is up to 1e5, which is big. Creating a list of 1e5+2 elements, each being a list of 201 elements. That's 1e5*201 =2e7 entries. Each can be initialized to 0, but for dynamic programming, perhaps we can optimize space.

   However, considering that for i, we only need the next i's values, perhaps we can use a 1D array, but since for each i, we need to process j in reverse order (from m downto 0), perhaps we can optimize the space.

   Wait, when computing i, the transitions depend on i+1 (for disturb) and next_time (which could be up to n+1). But next_time could be up to d_i +1, which can be up to n+1.

   So for example, when i is processed, the next_time could be up to (n) +1. So for i=1, next_time could be up to n+1.

   So using a 1D array for DP would be challenging. So it's better to use a 2D array.

   However, in Python, creating a list of lists with 1e5+2 rows and 201 columns may be memory intensive. For example, in Python, each integer is a pointer (about 8 bytes in CPython), but for 2e7 elements, that's 2e7 *8 bytes = 160MB, which is manageable.

   So the code can proceed with a 2D array. But to optimize space, perhaps we can use two 1D arrays: current and next. However, the problem is that next_time can jump to any value, not just i+1.

   For example, when collecting an envelope, we jump to d_i +1, which could be much larger than i+1. So we need to have the entire DP array filled out for all possible i.

   So the 2D approach is necessary.

   So the code will have a DP array of size (n+2) x (m+1), where each entry is initialized to infinity, except for i >=n+1 which are 0.

   But how to handle the (n+1) case?

   Alternatively, we can precompute the DP array up to n+1, and for any next_time beyond n+1, assume 0.

   So in code:

   For i in range(n, 0, -1):

       for j in range(m, -1, -1):

           # compute option1 and option2

   Now, during the computation, for next_time, if next_time >n, then dp[next_time][j] is 0.

   So the code can handle it by checking if next_time is <=n, and adding accordingly.

   So, in code:

   if best_w[i] >0:

       next_time = best_d[i] +1

       if next_time >n:

           option2 = best_w[i]

       else:

           option2 = best_w[i] + dp[next_time][j]

   else:

       next_time =i+1

       if next_time >n:

           option2 =0

       else:

           option2 = dp[next_time][j]

   So for option2, whether the next_time is beyond n or not.

   Now, the code for the DP.

   Now, the code steps:

   Read n, m, k.

   Read all k envelopes, and sort them by s_i.

   Precompute best_w and best_d for each x.

   Initialize dp as a list of (n+2) elements, each is a list of m+1 elements. Initialize to 0.

   Wait, no. The initial state for i>n is 0.

   So for the DP, for i from n downto 1:

       for j from 0 to m:

           compute options.

   Wait, perhaps the code should be:

   Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimal coins from time i onwards with j disturbances left.

   Wait, perhaps the original approach was reversed. Let's think again.

   When the code computes dp[i][j], it's the minimal coins collected starting from i with j disturbances remaining. Because for the transitions, when we disturb, we subtract j by 1.

   So for the initial condition, when i >n, dp[i][j] =0 for all j.

   Then, for i from n downto 1:

       for j from 0 to m:

           # compute options

   But in the code, for j, we can loop from m downto 0, to reuse the same row.

   Wait, but in Python, the loops can be structured as:

   for i in reversed(range(1, n+1)):

       for j in reversed(range(m+1)):

           ... compute dp[i][j]

   So the code uses the same array and overwrites the values in reverse order.

   So the code outline:

   Initialize dp as a 2D array with (n+2) rows and (m+1) columns, all set to 0.

   Wait, no. Because for i <=n, we need to compute dp[i][j], which depends on higher i's.

   Wait, the DP array is initially filled with 0 for i >n. For i <=n, we compute based on i+1, etc.

   So the code initializes the dp array as a list of (n+2) lists, each of length (m+1), initialized to 0. Then, for i from n downto 1, and j from m downto 0, compute the value.

   So in code:

   dp = [[0]*(m+2) for _ in range(n+2)]

   But in Python, lists are 0-based, so indexes are from 0 to n+1.

   Wait, perhaps better to use 1-based indexes. For example, i ranges from 1 to n+1. So the dp array is of size (n+2) for i (0 to n+1), and (m+1) for j (0 to m).

   So for i in range(n+1, 0, -1):

       for j in range(m, -1, -1):

           ...

   So in code:

```

   So the code works for the samples.

   Now, considering the constraints.

   The precomputation is O(k log k) for sorting, then O(n log k) for processing each x and maintaining the heap. For k=1e5 and n=1e5, this is manageable.

   The DP is O(n*m), which is 1e5 *200=2e7 operations.

   So the code should pass within the time and memory constraints.

   Now, implement this in Python.

   Edge cases to consider:

   - m=0: no disturbances allowed.

   - All envelopes have d_i =n, so collecting any envelope blocks until the end.

   - Envelopes with overlapping ranges but different w and d.

   Now, code:

   The code needs to read the input, sort the envelopes, precompute best_w and best_d, then compute the DP.

   Now, handling the envelopes' sorting.

   Now, code:

   The code as outlined above.
