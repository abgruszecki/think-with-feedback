Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of substrings of a given string that are "pretty". A pretty substring is one where the question marks can be replaced such that the result is a correct bracket sequence. And correct bracket sequences must be balanced, properly nested, etc.

First, let's understand what makes a substring a correct bracket sequence. For a string to be a correct bracket sequence, it must satisfy two main conditions:

1. The total number of brackets must be even. Because every opening bracket must have a closing one. So any substring with odd length can't be a correct bracket sequence. So right away, any substring with odd length is invalid. So when we check substrings, we can immediately skip those with odd lengths.

2. The balance of the brackets must never drop below zero when scanning from left to right. Also, the total number of opening and closing brackets must be balanced. But wait, because there are question marks, which can be either. So how do we check if a substring can be transformed into a correct sequence?

Hmm. So for each substring, we need to determine if there's a way to replace '?'s with '(' or ')' such that the resulting string is a correct bracket sequence.

The approach here is to iterate over all possible substrings of even length, and for each, check if it can form a correct bracket sequence.

But the problem is that the string can be up to 5000 characters long, so the number of possible substrings is O(n^2) which for 5000 is 12.5 million. For each of these, we need a check that's efficient. If each check takes O(n) time, that's O(n^3), which is 12.5e6 * 5e3 = 6.25e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

So we need an O(n^2) solution. Let's think about how to check each substring efficiently.

Let's think about the necessary conditions for a substring to be a correct bracket sequence when considering the possible replacements of '?'.

Let's denote the substring has length m, which must be even. Let's say m is even, so m is even.

We need the following conditions:

1. The total possible number of '(' and ')' after replacing '?' must be balanced. That is, the sum of (number of '(' + possible '(' from '?') and (number of ')' + possible ')' from '?') must allow for exactly m/2 of each. Because each correct bracket sequence must have equal numbers of '(' and ')'.

So, let's compute for a substring s, the number of existing '(' (fixed_left), existing ')' (fixed_right), and the number of '?' (q).

We need:

fixed_left + a = fixed_right + b, where a is the number of '?' replaced to '(', and b is the number replaced to ')'. Also, a + b = q.

But since the total must be m/2 of each, the total number of '(' after replacement is fixed_left + a, and the total ') ' is fixed_right + (q - a).

The total '(' must equal the total ')', so:

fixed_left + a = fixed_right + (q - a)

=> 2a = fixed_right - fixed_left + q

=> a = (fixed_right - fixed_left + q) / 2

But a must be an integer between 0 and q. So the right-hand side must be an integer, and the resulting a must be in that range.

But wait, since the total number of '(' plus the a must be m/2 (since each bracket must have exactly m/2 of each). So:

fixed_left + a = m/2

Similarly, fixed_right + (q - a) = m/2.

So substituting a from the first equation:

a = m/2 - fixed_left

Then, since a must be >=0 and <= q:

0 ≤ a ≤ q

So:

m/2 - fixed_left >= 0 → fixed_left ≤ m/2

and

m/2 - fixed_left <= q → fixed_left + q >= m/2

So these are two conditions. Also, since a can't be negative, and the sum of a and (q - a) must be q.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total number of '(' after replacement is fixed_left + a, and it must equal m/2. So:

fixed_left + a = m/2 → a = (m/2) - fixed_left

But since a can't be negative and can't exceed q, we must have:

a ≥ 0 → m/2 - fixed_left ≥ 0 → fixed_left ≤ m/2.

and a ≤ q → m/2 - fixed_left ≤ q → fixed_left + q ≥ m/2.

So these are two necessary conditions.

Similarly, the number of ')' after replacement is fixed_right + (q - a) = fixed_right + q - (m/2 - fixed_left) = fixed_right + q - m/2 + fixed_left = (fixed_left + fixed_right) + q - m/2.

But since the total must be m/2, this equals m/2. So:

fixed_right + (q - a) = m/2 → substituting a gives fixed_right + q - (m/2 - fixed_left) = m/2 → fixed_right + q + fixed_left - m/2 = m/2 → fixed_left + fixed_right + q = m. But fixed_left + fixed_right is the number of fixed characters in the substring (since the rest are '?'), which is m - q. So substituting:

(m - q) + q = m → m = m. So that's always true. So this condition is automatically satisfied. So the main conditions are that a must be between 0 and q, and also that when processing the string, the balance never drops below zero.

But even if the total can be made to be m/2 of each, the sequence could still have a point where the balance is negative. For example, if the string is "))((", then even though it's length 4 and has 2 '(' and 2 ')', the order is wrong.

So the second condition is that during the processing of the string from left to right, the balance (current number of '(' - ')') must never drop below zero at any point. And at the end, it must be exactly zero.

But when there are '?', which can be either '(', ')', how do we check if there's a way to replace them such that the balance never goes negative?

This is a classic problem. The approach here is to track the possible minimum and maximum possible balance as we process each character.

For each position in the substring:

- When we encounter '(', the min and max balance both increase by 1.
- When we encounter ')', the min and max balance decrease by 1.
- When we encounter '?', the min balance decreases by 1 (if we choose ')'), and the max increases by 1 (if we choose '('). So the possible range is [current_min-1, current_max+1].

But during processing, the max balance can't be allowed to drop below zero, because that would mean there's no possible way to choose replacements that keep the balance non-negative.

So for the entire substring, after processing each character, the min and max balance must satisfy:

At any step, the current_max >=0 (because otherwise even the best case choice of '?' as '(' would still have a negative balance, which is invalid).

Also, after processing all characters, the min balance must be <=0 and the max balance >=0, so that the final balance is zero.

So the algorithm for checking a substring is:

1. Check if the length is even. If not, skip.

2. Compute the number of fixed '(' and ')', then check if (fixed_left <= m/2) and (fixed_left + q >= m/2). If not, skip.

3. Then, simulate the possible min and max balance as we process each character in the substring.

   a. Initialize min_balance and max_balance to 0.

   b. For each character in the substring:

      i. If '(', increment both min and max by 1.

      ii. If ')', decrement both by 1.

      iii. If '?', min decreases by 1, max increases by 1.

      iv. After each step, clamp the min_balance to 0 if it becomes negative. Because, the min_balance can't be lower than the possible minimum when choosing the maximum possible '(' (since that's the only way to get higher balance). Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: when there's a '?', we can choose it as either '(' or ')', but in order to maintain the balance as high as possible or as low as possible.

      Wait, perhaps the min and max need to be adjusted as follows: after each character, the min_balance is the minimum possible possible balance up to that point, and the max_balance is the maximum possible. However, if the min_balance becomes negative, we can't allow the balance to drop below zero, because once it does, the entire sequence is invalid. But wait, no: the check is whether there exists a way to choose replacements such that the balance never drops below zero. So during processing, we need to track the possible range of balances, and if the min_balance is ever negative, we can adjust it because we can choose the replacements in a way that keeps the balance as high as possible.

Wait, here's the correct approach for tracking min and max balance:

At each step, the possible balance is in the range [current_min, current_max]. However, during processing, we can't allow the max balance to be negative. Because once the max balance (the best possible balance if we choose all replacements to maximize balance) is negative, then even in the best case, the balance is negative. So that's impossible.

So during processing:

For each character:

- Update min and max based on the character.

- If the character is '(', then both min and max increase by 1.

- If ')', both decrease by 1.

- If '?', min decreases by 1 (if we choose ')'), and max increases by 1 (if we choose '(').

After each step, the min_balance can't be lower than 0, but wait no. Wait, the min_balance represents the minimum possible balance that can be achieved by choosing replacements up to this point. But if the min_balance is negative, but there exists a replacement that allows the balance to be higher, then we can have a path that doesn't dip below zero.

But the problem is that the balance must never dip below zero in any prefix. So even if there's a possible path where at some point the balance is negative, that's invalid.

So the idea is that during processing, the possible range of balances must always allow for a non-negative balance. So after processing each character, we need to adjust the min and max to ensure that the range [min, max] includes possible balances that can be achieved while keeping all intermediate balances >=0.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct way: 

After each step, the current possible min and max balance can be computed, but after each step, the min_balance can't be lower than 0. Because if the max_balance after any step is negative, then even the best possible choice of '?'s would result in a balance that's negative, so the substring is invalid.

So here's the approach:

Initialize min_balance and max_balance to 0.

For each character in the substring:

   if char is '(':
       min_balance +=1
       max_balance +=1
   elif char is ')':
       min_balance -=1
       max_balance -=1
   else: # '?'
       min_balance -=1
       max_balance +=1

   After updating, we need to adjust min_balance and max_balance to account for the fact that the balance cannot be negative at any step.

   So, if the max_balance becomes negative, then there's no possible way to have a valid sequence. So we can break early here.

   Also, the min_balance can't be lower than 0. Because even if the min_balance is negative, the actual balance could have been higher by choosing some '?' as '(', which would increase the balance. So the min_balance is the minimum possible balance, but we can't allow any possible balance to be negative. So to represent the possible balances after considering that the balance can't dip below zero, we adjust min_balance to be the maximum between the current min_balance and 0. 

   So:

   min_balance = max(min_balance, 0)

   if max_balance < 0:
       break and mark as invalid.

So during processing, after each character, we adjust min and max balance as follows:

   For the next character, after updating min_balance and max_balance, we set:

   min_balance = max(min_balance, 0)

   if max_balance < 0:
       break (the substring is invalid)

At the end of processing all characters, we need to check if the min_balance <=0 <= max_balance. Because the final balance must be zero, so 0 must be within the possible range of balances.

So putting this all together:

For a substring to be valid:

1. Its length is even.

2. The number of fixed '(' and '?' must allow for exactly m/2 '(' in total (i.e., fixed_left <= m/2 and fixed_left + q >= m/2). Because the total number of '(' after replacement is m/2.

3. When processing the substring, the possible balance ranges must allow for a path where the balance never drops below zero, and the final balance is zero.

So for each possible substring (l, r) with even length:

   m = r - l + 1

   if m % 2 != 0: skip

   compute fixed_left (number of '(' in the substring), fixed_right (number of ')'), q = m - fixed_left - fixed_right.

   required_open = m//2

   if fixed_left > required_open: skip (even if we replace all ? as ), we have too many fixed '(')

   if fixed_left + q < required_open: skip (even if we replace all ? as '(', we can't reach required_open)

   else:

       process the substring, track min_balance and max_balance as follows:

       min_bal = 0

       max_bal = 0

       valid = True

       for c in substring:

           if c == '(':

               min_bal +=1

               max_bal +=1

           elif c == ')':

               min_bal -=1

               max_bal -=1

           else:

               min_bal -=1

               max_bal +=1

           # after this, adjust min_bal to be at least 0

           min_bal = max(min_bal, 0)

           if max_bal < 0:

               valid = False

               break

       if valid and (min_bal <= 0 <= max_bal):

           count +=1

So this is the algorithm.

Now, the problem is how to implement this efficiently.

The main steps are:

- Iterate over all possible substrings with even length.

- For each, compute fixed_left, fixed_right, q, check the first two conditions.

- Then simulate the balance ranges.

The challenge is to compute fixed_left and fixed_right for all possible substrings quickly.

But computing fixed_left for every possible substring can be done using a prefix sum array.

Let's precompute a prefix sum array for '(' and another for ')'.

For example, precompute prefix_opens[i] = number of '(' in s[0..i-1], similarly for prefix_closes.

Then, for a substring s[l..r] (0-based), the number of '(' is prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l], and similarly for ')'.

q is (r - l + 1) - (opens + closes).

So with this, we can compute the necessary checks in O(1) per substring.

So the steps for the code:

1. Precompute prefix_opens and prefix_closes.

2. Iterate over all possible l and r in the string, where l ranges from 0 to n-1, r ranges from l to n-1.

   For each substring s[l..r], check if the length is even.

   Then compute opens = prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l]

   closes = prefix_closes[r+1] - prefix_closes[l]

   q = (r - l + 1) - opens - closes

   required_open = (r - l + 1) // 2

   if opens > required_open: skip

   if opens + q < required_open: skip

   else: proceed to check balance.

   Now, simulate the balance for the substring. For each character in s[l..r], track min and max balance.

   If during processing, max_bal < 0, break and invalid.

   At end, check if 0 is between min_bal and max_bal.

   If yes, increment the answer.

But simulating the balance for each substring is O(m) per substring, which is O(n^3) in the worst case. For n=5000, this is O(5000^3) which is 125e9 operations. That's way too slow.

This is a problem. So the O(n^3) approach is not feasible. So we need a way to optimize this.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to precompute some information. Alternatively, perhaps for each possible starting position l, we can process all possible r's in O(n) time. Let's think.

Wait, for a fixed l, when we process the substring starting at l and ending at r, as r increases, the characters are added to the right. So for each l, we can track the min and max balance as we extend the substring to the right.

For example, for l=0, we can process r from 0 to n-1, and for each step, compute the min and max balance up to r. If the current character is s[r], then for the substring [l..r], we can track the balance from l to r.

Wait, this seems possible. Let's see:

For each l from 0 to n-1:

   Initialize min_bal and max_bal to 0.

   for r from l to n-1:

       char = s[r]

       update min_bal and max_bal based on char.

       then, check if the substring [l..r] has even length, and the other conditions.

       So for each r, during the loop, we can compute the min and max balance for the substring [l..r].

Wait, but this way, for each l, we process the substring starting at l, and extending to r, incrementally. For each step (r), we can compute the min_bal and max_bal for the current substring.

But how does that work? Because when we process r, the substring is l to r. So for each step, the previous state (min and max for l to r-1) is known, and adding the r-th character.

Yes! Because the substring is built incrementally. So for each l, we can track the min_bal and max_bal as we extend the substring to the right. So for each l, the process is:

start with min_bal = 0, max_bal =0.

For each r >= l:

   char = s[r]

   update min_bal and max_bal.

   then, after each step (after processing s[r]), check:

   if the current substring length (r - l +1) is even.

   and check the other conditions (fixed_left, q, required_open).

   and then check if during processing, the max_bal never went negative, and at the end, 0 is within the [min_bal, max_bal].

But how do we track the fixed_left and fixed_right for each substring as we increment r?

We can precompute prefix arrays for the number of '(' and ')'.

So for example, for each l and r, opens = prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l]

Similarly for closes.

So during the loop for r in l to n-1:

   m = r - l +1

   if m %2 !=0:

       skip the rest of the checks.

   else:

       required_open = m//2

       opens = prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l]

       closes = prefix_closes[r+1] - prefix_closes[l]

       q = m - opens - closes

       if opens > required_open or (opens + q) < required_open:

           continue

       else:

           check if the current min_bal and max_bal (after processing all characters from l to r) have 0 in their range.

But wait, how are we tracking the min_bal and max_bal for the substring l to r?

Because when we process from l to r, each step (r) adds the next character. So for each l, we start with min_bal=0, max_bal=0. Then, for each r in l to n-1:

   char = s[r]

   process this character and update min_bal and max_bal.

   then, for the current substring l..r:

       check if the length is even.

       if yes, compute the required_open and check the conditions.

       then, check if during processing the substring (from l to r), the max_bal never became negative (i.e., the processing up to this point didn't have any step where max_bal became negative) and the final min_bal <=0 <= max_bal.

Wait, but how do we know that during processing the substring l..r, the max_bal never dropped below zero? Because as we process each character incrementally, the max_bal is tracked. But during the processing, whenever we add a new character, we need to ensure that after each step, the max_bal remains >=0.

But in this approach, for each l, we process the characters starting from l, and for each r, track the min and max balance incrementally. However, if during processing, the max_bal becomes negative at any step (for any character in the current substring), then the entire substring l..r is invalid. But in this approach, once the max_bal drops below zero, any further extensions (r+1, etc.) would still have the same problem. So once, for a given l and r, the max_bal becomes negative, all larger r for this l can be skipped.

So the approach is:

For each l from 0 to n-1:

   current_min = 0

   current_max = 0

   for r from l to n-1:

       char = s[r]

       if char == '(':

           current_min +=1

           current_max +=1

       elif char == ')':

           current_min -=1

           current_max -=1

       else: # '?'

           current_min -=1

           current_max +=1

       # After processing the character, adjust current_min to be >=0.

       current_min = max(current_min, 0)

       # If current_max is negative, this substring and all longer ones starting at l are invalid.

       if current_max < 0:

           break

       # Now check if the substring l..r is a candidate.

       m = r - l +1

       if m %2 !=0:

           continue

       required_open = m//2

       opens = prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l]

       closes = prefix_closes[r+1] - prefix_closes[l]

       q = m - opens - closes

       # Check the first two conditions.

       if opens > required_open or (opens + q) < required_open:

           continue

       # Now check if current_min <=0 <= current_max.

       if current_min <= 0 <= current_max:

           count +=1

This approach is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=5000 (25 million operations).

Let's verify this:

For each l in 0..n-1:

   process r from l to n-1.

   For each r, the inner loop is O(1) per step, except when processing the character, which is O(1).

   But in the worst case, each l runs through all n steps. So total steps are O(n^2).

Yes.

Now, the code:

We need to precompute prefix_opens and prefix_closes.

For example:

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)

prefix_opens = [0]*(n+1)

prefix_closes = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_opens[i+1] = prefix_opens[i] + (s[i] == '(')

    prefix_closes[i+1] = prefix_closes[i] + (s[i] == ')')

Then, for each l in 0..n-1:

   current_min = 0

   current_max = 0

   for r in l..n-1:

       char = s[r]

       ... process ...

So the code would look something like this:

count =0

for l in range(n):

    current_min = 0

    current_max =0

    for r in range(l, n):

        c = s[r]

        if c == '(':

            current_min +=1

            current_max +=1

        elif c == ')':

            current_min -=1

            current_max -=1

        else:

            current_min -=1

            current_max +=1

        # adjust min_balance

        current_min = max(current_min, 0)

        if current_max <0:

            break

        # check length is even

        m = r - l +1

        if m %2 !=0:

            continue

        # compute required_open

        required_open = m//2

        opens = prefix_opens[r+1] - prefix_opens[l]

        closes = prefix_closes[r+1] - prefix_closes[l]

        q = m - opens - closes

        # check the first two conditions

        if opens > required_open or (opens + q) < required_open:

            continue

        # check if 0 is in [current_min, current_max]

        if current_min <=0 <= current_max:

            count +=1

print(count)

This should work.

Testing the first sample input:

Sample Input 1: "((?))"

The string is indices 0 to 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's see:

n=5.

But the code will process all substrings of even length.

Let's consider l=0:

Processing r from 0 to4.

But for r=0: m=1 (odd), skipped.

r=1: m=2. required_open=1.

opens = prefix_opens[2] - prefix_opens[0]. The string starts with '(', then '(', so prefix_opens[0] is 0, prefix_opens[2] is 2. So opens=2.

required_open is 1. So opens (2) > required_open (1). So condition opens > required_open → continue. So this substring is not considered.

r=2: m=3, odd. skipped.

r=3: m=4 even.

required_open=2.

opens = number of '(' from l=0 to r=3. The substring is '((?', which has two '(', and one '?'.

opens is 2.

q is 4 - 2 - 0 (since closes is 0) → q=2.

required_open=2.

opens (2) <= required_open (2), and opens + q (2+2=4) >= required_open (2). So conditions satisfied.

current_min and current_max:

Let's track for l=0 and r from 0 to 3.

When r=3 (the substring is 0-3):

Processing the characters step by step (for l=0):

r=0 (char '('): current_min=1, current_max=1. No break. m=1: skipped.

r=1 (char '('): current_min=2, current_max=2. m=2, even. required_open=1. opens=2>1 → skip.

r=2 (char '?'): 

current_min was 2 (from previous step for r=1). Now for r=2, which is the '?', current_min becomes 2-1=1, current_max becomes 2+1=3. Then adjust current_min to max(1,0) → 1. current_max is 3. m=3 (odd) → skipped.

r=3 (char ')'):

current_min was 1, current_max 3.

Processing ')': subtract 1 from min and max.

current_min = 0, current_max=2.

Adjust current_min to 0.

current_max is 2 >=0.

m=4, required_open=2.

opens=2 (from substring '((? )' → '((?') → the first three characters are '(', '(', '?', but the fourth is ')'. So up to r=3, the substring is 0-3: '((?)' → opens is 2 (positions 0 and 1 are '(', position 2 is '?', and position 3 is ')'). So closes is 1 (position 3). So opens is 2, closes is 1, q is 4-2-1=1.

required_open=4//2=2.

opens (2) <=2. opens + q=2+1=3 >=2 → conditions satisfied.

Check if 0 is between current_min (0) and current_max (2): yes. So count +=1.

So this substring is counted.

Then continue processing r=4 (char ')') for l=0:

char is ')', current_min becomes 0-1=-1 → adjust to 0. current_max becomes 2-1=1.

current_max >=0.

m=5 (odd) → skipped.

So for l=0, during processing, there's one valid substring (r=3, l=0: length 4).

But wait, the first sample's output is 4. So perhaps other substrings are also counted.

Let's see the code's logic.

Another example: l=1, r=2 (substring is '(?', which has length 2).

For l=1:

r=1: m=1, odd.

r=2: m=2, even.

required_open=1.

opens is s[1] and s[2] (characters '(', '?') → opens=1 (since s[1] is '(').

q =2-1-0=1.

opens=1 <=1, opens + q=2 >=1 → conditions satisfied.

Processing the characters for l=1 to r=2:

current_min and current_max:

At r=1 (char '('):

current_min and current_max start at 0.

Processing '(', min and max become 1.

m=1, odd → skip.

At r=2 (char '?'):

current_min =1-1=0, current_max=1+1=2.

Adjust min to max(0, 0) → 0.

m=2 even.

required_open=1.

opens=1 (char at l=1 is '(', and r=2 is '? → opens=1).

q=2-1-0=1.

Conditions met.

Check if 0 is between 0 and 2 → yes.

So count +=1.

This corresponds to the first valid substring in the sample: "(?" (indices 1-2?), or maybe the substring from 0-1? Need to check indexes.

Wait, in the code, l and r are 0-based. So for the first sample input "((?))", which is 5 characters (indices 0-4).

The first valid substring is l=0 and r=1 (chars '()'?), but in the first sample, the first valid substring is "(?" which can be transformed to "()".

In the code, let's see:

For l=0 and r=1 (substring "(" and '(', which is '(()' no. Wait, the first sample input is "((?))". So the first sample is "((?))" which is characters 0:'(', 1:'(', 2:'?', 3:')', 4:')'.

So for l=0, r=1: substring '(()' but that's two '('s, which can't form a correct sequence. So maybe the code counts it when l=0 and r=3 (the substring "((?)") which can be transformed to "(())".

In the code, for l=0 and r=3, m=4.

But let's see:

In that case, opens is 2 (the first two '('). required_open is 2. opens is 2 <=2. opens + q is 2 +1 (q is 4-2-1=1) → 3 >=2. So conditions met.

Then the current_min and current_max after processing all four characters:

Processing the four characters:

char 0: '(', current_min and max becomes 1.

char 1: '(', min and max 2.

char 2: '?', min 1, max 3. adjusted to min 1.

char 3: ')', min 0, max 2.

At the end, current_min is 0, current_max is 2. So 0 is within [0, 2], so it's valid. So count increases by 1.

But according to the first sample, there are four valid substrings. Let's see how the code counts them.

Sample 1's valid substrings are:

1. "(?" (indices 0-1? Or 1-2?) → perhaps l=0 and r=1 is '(()' which is invalid. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the sample input is "((?))".

The first sample's explanation says:

1. "(?" which can be transformed to "()". So this is substring positions 0-1 (indices 0 and 1 are '(' and '? → no. Wait, the first two characters are '(', '(', then '?', then ')', etc. So "(?" is perhaps the substring starting at index 0, length 2: the first two characters are '(', '(', which can't form "()". Hmm, maybe the sample explanation refers to other positions.

Wait, the sample input is ((?)). So the string is "((?))".

The valid substrings according to the sample:

1. "(?" → which could be index 0-1? But that's '(()', no. Oh wait, maybe it's index 0-1 is '((', which is not possible. Or perhaps the first sample's explanation is considering 1-based indices.

Ah, the problem statement says (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s|. So the first sample's first valid substring is l=1 and r=2 (assuming 1-based), which would be the substring s[1..2], which is '? (but in the sample input, the third character is '?', so perhaps I'm getting confused with 0-based vs 1-based indices.

Alternatively, perhaps the first valid substring is l=0 and r=1 (0-based) in code, but that's two '(', which cannot form a correct sequence. So perhaps I need to re-express the sample.

Wait, the sample input is "((?))". Let's list all possible substrings of even length and see which are valid.

The string is 5 characters: 0: '(', 1:'(', 2:'?', 3:')', 4:')'.

The sample output is 4.

The sample explanation lists:

1. "(?" → transformed to "()". So this is length 2. The substring must be two characters, with one '(' and one '?'.

In the sample input, the possible 2-length substrings are:

positions 0-1: '(', '(' → can't be transformed into "()".

positions 1-2: '(', '?' → can be transformed into "()". So yes.

positions 2-3: '?', ')' → can be transformed into "()".

positions 3-4: ')', ')', no.

So for l=1 and r=2 (0-based), substring is '(', '?', which can be transformed into "()". So when l=1 and r=2:

m=2, required_open=1.

opens is 1 (from '(', so opens=1).

q=1 (the '?').

So opens=1 <=1 and opens + q=2 >=1. So conditions met.

Then the balance processing:

char 1: '(', current_min=1, current_max=1. m=1, no.

char 2: '?', current_min=0, current_max=2. m=2, even.

Check required_open=1.

opens is 1, q=1. So yes.

current_min=0, current_max=2. 0 is within this range. So valid. So this counts as one.

Similarly, substring l=2 and r=3: '?', ')'.

Processing: required_open=1.

opens=0, closes=1. q=1.

required_open=1.

opens=0 <=1, opens + q=1 >=1.

So during balance processing:

char 2 is '?', current_min=-1 → adjusted to 0, current_max=1.

Then char 3 is ')': current_min=0-1=-1 → adjusted to 0. current_max=1-1=0.

At end: min_bal=0, max_bal=0. 0 is in range.

So yes. So this is another valid substring.

Thus, the code should count these as valid.

So for l=1, r=2: count +=1.

For l=2, r=3: count +=1.

Then, longer substrings like l=0 to r=3: '((?)' → transformed to "(())".

In this case, during balance processing:

char 0: '(', min=1, max=1.

char 1: '(', min=2, max=2.

char 2: '?', min=1, max=3. adjusted to 1.

char 3: ')', min=0, max=2.

At end, min=0, max=2 → 0 in range. So yes.

required_open=2.

opens=2 (two '('s). q=1. opens + q=3 >=2.

So conditions met. count +=1.

Another valid substring is l=1 to r=4: but no, the substring is '(?))' → length 4. required_open=2.

opens=1 (from '(' at position 1), closes=2 (positions 3 and4).

q=1.

So required_open=2. opens=1 <=2, opens + q=2 >=2. So conditions met.

Then balance processing:

char 1: '(', min=1, max=1.

char 2: '?', min=0, max=2.

char 3: ')', min= -1 → adjusted to 0. max=1.

char4: ')', min= -1 → adjusted to 0. max=0.

At end, min=0, max=0 → 0 in range.

So count +=1.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, the valid substrings are:

3. "((?)" → transformed to "(())".

4. "(?))" → transformed to "(())".

So these two are substrings of length 4.

So the code counts these as valid.

So the code for sample input 1 would count 4 valid substrings.

Thus, the code works for sample 1.

For sample 2: input is "??()??". The output is7.

The code should handle that as well.

Thus, this approach seems correct.

Now, implementing the code in Python.

We need to precompute prefix_opens and prefix_closes.

Then, iterate l from 0 to n-1, and for each l, iterate r from l to n-1.

The code is straightforward.

But for Python, we need to handle the indices correctly.

So the code will be:

Read the input string.

Compute prefix_opens and prefix_closes.

Iterate l from 0 to len(s)-1.

For each l, iterate r from l to len(s)-1.

Update current_min and current_max.

Check conditions.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

        prefix_closes[i+1] = prefix_closes[i] + (s[i] == ')')

    count = 0
