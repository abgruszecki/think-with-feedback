Okay, let's see. The problem is about choosing q-2 painters out of q available ones such that the total painted sections are maximized. And we need to find the maximum possible number of painted sections after excluding exactly two painters. Hmm.

First, the naive approach would be to consider all possible pairs of painters to exclude, compute the coverage for each case, and then take the maximum. But with q up to 5000, that's O(q²) possibilities. For each pair, how do we compute the coverage efficiently?

Wait, if q is 5000, then q squared is 25 million. For each of those 25 million pairs, we need to compute how much of the fence is covered by the remaining q-2 painters. How can we compute this efficiently?

The straightforward way would be for each pair (a, b) to exclude, check every section and see if it's covered by any painter except a and b. But that's O(n) per pair, leading to 25 million * 5000 = 125 billion operations. That's way too slow for a 2-second time limit.

So we need a smarter way. Let's think about inclusion-exclusion. The total coverage when excluding two painters is equal to the total coverage of all painters except those two. So maybe we can precompute some data structures that allow us to calculate this quickly.

First, let's think about the total coverage when all q painters are included. But since we're excluding two, the coverage depends on which painters are excluded. So for each pair (i, j) to exclude, we need to find the union of all painters except i and j. How?

Alternative approach: For each section x, track how many painters cover it. Then, when excluding two painters, subtract any sections where the count drops to zero. Wait, but that's not accurate. Because if a section is covered by three painters, excluding two of them would still leave it covered by the third. So the section is only lost if the remaining painters (after exclusion) don't cover it.

But this seems tricky. Maybe another way: For each painter, track for each section x whether x is covered by other painters when this painter is excluded. But with two painters excluded, it's more complex.

Hmm. Let's think of it this way: the total painted sections when excluding painters i and j is the union of all the intervals of the remaining painters. The problem is to compute the size of this union as quickly as possible.

The standard way to compute the size of a union of intervals is to process them in sorted order and merge overlapping intervals. But doing this for each pair (i, j) is O(q² * q), which is again way too slow.

So we need a way to precompute some information so that for any pair (i, j), we can compute the union of all intervals except i and j efficiently.

Another idea: For each possible pair (i, j), the union is the union of all intervals except i and j. If we can precompute for all intervals except i and j the merged intervals, but storing that for all pairs is impossible (25 million pairs, each possibly needing O(n) storage).

Alternative approach: Find the minimal impact of removing two painters. Perhaps the two painters that contribute the least to the total coverage. But this isn't straightforward. Because even a painter that covers a lot might have overlapping regions covered by others, so removing them might not reduce the total coverage much.

Wait, the optimal solution is to remove two painters such that their combined contribution (in terms of unique sections that only they cover) is as large as possible. So that removing them would free up those sections, but since those sections are only covered by them, their removal would subtract those sections from the total.

So perhaps the key is to find the two painters whose removal would result in the least loss of coverage.

But how do we compute that?

Let's think of it as:

Total coverage when all are included = T.

When we exclude painters i and j, the new coverage is T minus the sections that were covered by only i, only j, or both.

Wait, no. Because some sections might have been covered by other painters. So the loss is the sections that are covered by i or j, but no other painter except possibly i and j. So the loss is the number of sections that are covered by i or j, but not covered by any other painter.

So the problem reduces to for each pair (i, j), compute the number of sections that are covered by i or j, and are not covered by any other painter. Then the answer is T minus the sum of such sections for the best (i,j) pair.

Because T is the total coverage when all are included. When we exclude i and j, the coverage is T minus the sections that are only covered by i or j (and no other painters). Because if a section is covered by i and also other painters, then even after removing i, the other painters still cover it. Similarly for j.

So the loss is the sections that are covered by i or j and are not covered by any other painter. So for each pair (i, j), the loss is (unique_i + unique_j - unique_both), where unique_i is the sections only covered by i, unique_j is sections only covered by j, and unique_both is sections covered by both i and j but no others.

Alternatively, the loss is the count of x where (x is in i or j) and (x is not covered by any other painter except i and j).

So how do we compute this for all pairs (i, j)?

If we can precompute for each section x, the set of painters that cover x. Then for each x, if the set has exactly one or two painters (those being i and j), then x would contribute to the loss when i and j are excluded.

But with n up to 5000 and q up to 5000, precomputing for each x the list of painters that cover it might be feasible.

Wait, for each x, we can track all the painters that cover x. Then, for each x, if the count of painters covering x is 1 (say painter i), then excluding i would cause x to be uncovered. Similarly, if the count is 2 (painters i and j), then excluding both would cause x to be uncovered.

So the total loss for excluding i and j is the number of x where:

- x is covered by i and/or j, and

- all painters covering x are either i or j (i.e., the set of painters covering x is a subset of {i, j}).

So for each pair (i,j), the loss is the sum over x where (i covers x or j covers x) and the total number of painters covering x (excluding i and j) is zero. Wait, no. Because when we exclude i and j, the other painters are still present. So for x to be in the loss, x must be covered by i or j, but when we remove i and j, there are no other painters left that cover x.

So the loss is the number of x such that:

x is in (L_i ∪ L_j) and (x is not covered by any painter except possibly i and j).

So, for x in L_i ∪ L_j:

if (the set of painters covering x, excluding i and j, is empty), then x is lost.

So the steps to compute this:

For each x, determine which painters cover x.

For each pair (i,j), the loss is the number of x in (L_i ∪ L_j) where x is covered by i or j, and the only painters covering x are i and j. So the total number of painters (excluding i and j) that cover x is zero.

So, for each x, the set of painters that cover x is S_x. Then, for x to contribute to the loss of pair (i,j), S_x must be a subset of {i, j}, and S_x is not empty. Because if S_x is a subset of {i,j}, then when we exclude i and j, x is not covered by any other painters.

Wait, but if S_x is {i}, then when we exclude i and j (assuming j is not in S_x), then x is not covered. Similarly, if S_x is {i, j}, and we exclude both, then x is not covered.

So for x to be in the loss for (i,j), x must be in L_i ∪ L_j, and S_x \ {i,j} is empty.

So the problem reduces to for each pair (i,j), compute the number of x where x is in L_i ∪ L_j and S_x is a subset of {i,j}.

So the key is to precompute for each x, the set S_x. Then for each pair (i,j), sum over x where x is in (L_i ∪ L_j) and S_x is a subset of {i,j}.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let's first compute for each x the set of painters that cover x. For each x, store a list of the indices of the painters that include x. This can be done by iterating over each painter and adding their index to all x in their interval. However, with n up to 5000 and q up to 5000, the total number of operations would be O(q * (r_i - l_i + 1)), which in the worst case (each painter covers all sections) would be 5000 * 5000 = 25 million, which is manageable.

But wait, for each painter i with interval l_i to r_i, adding i to all x in l_i..r_i would be O(n) per painter. If n is 5000 and q is 5000, that's 25 million operations. Which is acceptable.

But maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for each painter i, l_i and r_i are given. We can represent the intervals and process them in a way that for each x, we can track the list of painters covering x.

Alternatively, for each painter i, we can note that it covers the range [l_i, r_i]. Then for each x, the list of painters covering x is the set of all i where l_i <= x <= r_i.

But building this list for each x is O(q) per x, which for n=5000 would be 5 million * 5000 = 25 million, which is manageable.

Wait, no. Wait, for each x from 1 to n:

We can loop through all q intervals and check if l_i <= x <= r_i. That would be O(n*q) operations. For n=5e3 and q=5e3, that's 25 million operations. Which is acceptable.

So we can precompute for each x, a list of painters (indices) that cover x. Let's call this list S_x.

Then, for each pair (i,j), the loss is the number of x where i is in S_x OR j is in S_x, and S_x \ {i,j} is empty. Because if S_x has other painters besides i and j, then even after excluding i and j, x is covered by someone else.

So the loss for (i,j) is the number of x where (i in S_x or j in S_x) and (S_x is a subset of {i,j}).

So for each x, if the set S_x is a subset of {i,j}, then x is counted if it's covered by i or j. Otherwise, it's not.

Now, how can we compute this efficiently for all pairs (i,j)?

The straightforward approach would be:

For each x, precompute S_x.

Then, for each pair (i,j), iterate over all x in L_i ∪ L_j and check if S_x is a subset of {i,j}.

But even that would be O(q^2) * O(n), which is 25 million * 5e3 = 125e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: For each x, S_x can be of varying sizes. For x where |S_x| >= 3, then any pair (i,j) where i and j are in S_x or not, but there's at least one other painter in S_x, then x will not be part of the loss for any pair (i,j). Because S_x would have a painter not in {i,j}, so when we exclude i and j, x is still covered by that other painter.

So, for x to contribute to any pair's loss, x must have |S_x| <= 2. Because if |S_x| is >=3, even if you exclude two painters (say, any two from S_x), there's still at least one painter left in S_x that covers x.

So, only x's with |S_x| = 1 or 2 can contribute to the loss of some pair (i,j).

Let's split into two cases:

Case 1: |S_x| = 1. Let the only painter in S_x be i. Then, x will be lost if and only if we exclude i (regardless of the other excluded painter). So x contributes to all pairs (i,j) where j is any other painter. But wait, the pair (i, j) excludes both i and j. So x will be part of the loss for pairs (i, j) where j is any other painter. So for x where S_x = {i}, the number of pairs (i,j) where x contributes to their loss is (q-1) pairs (all j not i). But how do we count this?

Alternatively, for x with S_x = {i}, the x is lost in any pair where i is excluded, regardless of the other excluded painter. So the number of pairs (a,b) where i is in {a,b} is C(q-1,1) + 1 (since pairs are ordered? Or are pairs considered unordered? Wait, in the problem statement, the pair (i,j) is considered the same as (j,i) because we are excluding two specific painters. So pairs are unordered.

So for x with S_x = {i}, the number of pairs that include i is (q-1 choose 1) (since we need to choose another painter to exclude alongside i). So total of q-1 pairs. So x contributes 1 to each of these q-1 pairs.

Case 2: |S_x| = 2. Let S_x = {i, j}. Then x is lost only if both i and j are excluded. So the pair (i,j) is the only pair where x contributes to the loss. So x adds 1 to the loss count of the pair (i,j).

So the total loss for a pair (i,j) is:

number of x where S_x = {i} plus number of x where S_x = {j} plus the number of x where S_x = {i,j}.

Additionally, if there's any x where S_x = {k} (k is either i or j), then those x contribute 1 to all pairs that include k. So for a pair (i,j), the loss is:

count_i (number of x where S_x = {i}) + count_j (number of x where S_x = {j}) + count_ij (number of x where S_x = {i,j}).

So the key is to precompute:

- For each i, count_1[i] is the number of x where S_x = {i}.

- For each pair (i,j), count_2[i][j] is the number of x where S_x = {i,j}.

Then, for each pair (i,j), the loss is count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j].

So the problem reduces to:

1. Compute count_1[i] for all i.

2. Compute count_2[i][j] for all i < j.

But how to compute these efficiently.

Let's think about how to compute count_1 and count_2.

First, for each x in 1..n:

If |S_x| == 1, then we have to find the painter i in S_x and increment count_1[i] by 1.

If |S_x| == 2, then for the two painters i and j (sorted to i < j?), increment count_2[i][j] by 1.

If |S_x| > 2, then no contribution to any pair's loss.

So, steps to compute count_1 and count_2:

- For each x from 1 to n:

   a. collect the list of painters that cover x.

   b. if the length is 1: count_1[i] +=1.

   c. if the length is 2: count_2[i][j] +=1 (where i and j are the two painters in sorted order? Or not? Because (i,j) and (j,i) are the same pair, so we can store it as i < j to avoid duplication.)

So, for each x with S_x of size 2, we can sort the two elements i and j (i < j) and increment count_2[i][j] by 1. This way, for any pair (i,j), regardless of order, we can look up count_2[i][j] if i < j, or count_2[j][i] if j < i.

Wait, but for a pair (i,j) where i > j, how do we find the count_2? Because count_2 is stored for i < j. So when we compute the loss for pair (i,j), we need to check count_2[min(i,j)][max(i,j)].

So, the plan is:

For each x:

   S = list of painters covering x.

   sort S.

   if len(S) == 1:

       count_1[S[0]] +=1

   elif len(S) == 2:

       i, j = S

       if i > j:

           i, j = j, i

       count_2[i][j] +=1

So, for each x, this takes O(k) time where k is the size of S for x. But for x with |S_x| >=3, we do nothing.

Once we have count_1 and count_2, for each pair (i,j), the loss is:

loss = count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2_ij, where count_2_ij is count_2[i][j] if i < j, else count_2[j][i].

Wait, but for pair (i,j) where i != j, we need to check if (i,j) is stored in count_2 as (i,j) or (j,i). So, regardless of the order of i and j, the count_2[i][j] (if i < j) is the correct value. So for a pair (i,j), we can compute the count_2 as follows:

if i == j: count_2[i][j] is zero, but since the pair (i,j) can't be considered (since you can't exclude the same painter twice?), but in the problem statement, each painter is considered once. So pairs (i,j) where i and j are distinct.

So for i != j:

a and b = sorted as min(i,j), max(i,j).

count_2_ij = count_2[a][b]

So the loss for pair (i,j) is count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2_ij.

But how?

Let me think of an example. Suppose x is covered by painters 2 and 3. Then, for pair (2,3), the count_2_ij is 1. For pair (3,2), when we compute a=2, b=3, count_2_ij is 1. So for any pair (i,j), sorted or not, the count_2_ij is correctly retrieved.

So the loss for pair (i,j) is count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j], but count_2 is only stored for i < j pairs. Wait, no. Because count_2 is a 2D array where count_2[i][j] is only defined when i < j. For i > j, count_2[i][j] would be zero. So when the pair is (j,i), we need to look at count_2[i][j], which is the same as the original count for (i,j). So, for example, pair (3,2) would have to look into count_2[2][3].

So, to compute the loss for a pair (i,j) where i and j are any two distinct indices (i != j), the correct count_2 is count_2[min(i,j)][max(i,j)].

But how is this stored? Let's say we have a 2D array where for i < j, count_2[i][j] is the number of x covered exactly by i and j. For i >= j, the value is zero.

So, for a pair (i,j) where i and j are in any order, we need to take the minimum and maximum of the two and look up count_2[i][j] in that order.

So, for the pair (i,j), the count_2 contribution is count_2.get((min(i,j), max(i,j)), 0).

But in Python, using a 2D array (list of lists) would be more efficient. So perhaps, create a 2D array count_2 of size q x q, initialized to zero. Then, for each x with S_x of size 2, we sort the two elements i and j, and increment count_2[i][j] by 1. So for i < j, count_2[i][j] is the correct value. For i > j, count_2[i][j] is zero, but the pair (i,j) would be handled by looking at count_2[j][i], which is the same as count_2[i][j] for i < j. Wait no. Because for i < j, count_2[i][j] is stored. For j < i, count_2[j][i] is stored. So for a pair (i,j) where i > j, the count_2 is count_2[j][i], which is the same as count_2[i][j] if i and j were swapped. But in our case, for x with S_x = {i, j}, we sort i and j and increment count_2[i][j] (i < j). So for any pair (a, b) where a and b are the two painters in any order, the count_2[a][b] (if a < b) is correct, and if a > b, then count_2[b][a] is the correct value. So when we compute the loss for (i,j), regardless of their order, we take count_2[min_i_j][max_i_j], where min_i_j is the minimum of i and j, and max_i_j is the maximum.

So, in code, for each pair i and j (i != j), the loss is:

loss = count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[min_ij][max_ij]

So, the steps are:

1. Precompute for all x, S_x (the set of painters covering x).

2. For each x, if |S_x| is 1, increment count_1 for that painter.

3. If |S_x| is 2, sort the two painters, and increment count_2 for (i,j).

4. Compute the total coverage T when all painters are included. This can be done by merging all intervals, then summing the lengths of the merged intervals.

Wait, but how to compute T? Because the initial T is the union of all intervals. So the merged intervals.

So to compute T, we need to merge all intervals of the q painters and sum their lengths.

But how to do that efficiently?

We can collect all the intervals, sort them by start time, then merge overlapping or adjacent intervals, and sum the total length.

Yes. That's manageable.

So the plan is:

- Compute T as the total coverage when all painters are included.

- Then, for each pair (i,j), compute the loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j] (if i < j) or count_2[j][i] (if j < i).

- The answer is T minus the minimum loss among all pairs (i,j). Because the maximum coverage after excluding two painters is T minus the loss caused by excluding i and j. So to maximize this, we need to minimize the loss.

So the maximum possible painted sections is T - min_loss, where min_loss is the minimum possible loss over all pairs (i,j). Wait, no: since the loss is how much you subtract from T. So to maximize the result, you want to subtract the smallest possible loss. So yes, find the pair (i,j) that when excluded, causes the least loss. The answer is T - loss[i,j].

So the steps are:

Compute T.

Compute all pairs (i,j) where i < j (to avoid duplicates?), compute their loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j]. Then, since pairs (i,j) and (j,i) are the same, but for each unordered pair, we can process them once.

Wait, but the pair (i,j) and (j,i) are the same pair, so we can process each unordered pair once. However, in the code, since the pairs are processed in a double loop where i ranges from 0 to q-1 and j ranges from i+1 to q-1, which is O(q²) time.

But since the loss for (i,j) and (j,i) is the same (since count_1[i] + count_1[j] is commutative, and count_2[i][j] is the same as count_2[j][i] in the way we stored it), the code can process each unordered pair once.

So the code structure would be:

Compute T.

Compute for all i < j pairs, the loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j].

Find the minimum loss among all pairs.

Then, the answer is T - min_loss.

Wait, but what about the pair (i,j) where i > j? For example, if i=3 and j=2. Then, the count_2 for (3,2) would be count_2[2][3], but in our code, we process i < j. So in the code, when looping over all i and j where i < j, the pairs are processed once. So for all possible pairs (i,j) (i != j), the code must compute the loss. But how?

Wait, in the problem statement, the pair (i,j) is any two distinct painters, order doesn't matter. So the total number of pairs is q*(q-1)/2. So in code, we can loop i from 0 to q-1, j from i+1 to q-1, compute the loss for (i,j), and keep track of the minimum loss.

But wait, what about when i and j are considered as (j,i)? Since we stored count_2[i][j] only for i < j, but in the pair (j,i), we need to take count_2[j][i], which is zero. But in reality, the count_2 is stored as count_2[i][j], so for (j,i), we have to compute it as count_2[i][j]. So perhaps, in code, for all pairs (i,j) where i and j are distinct, regardless of order, compute the loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[min(i,j)][max(i,j)].

But in that case, the code would need to loop over all possible pairs (i,j) where i != j, which is O(q²) pairs. For q=5000, that's 25 million pairs, which is acceptable.

But how to do that efficiently in code.

But wait, for example, when i < j, then count_2[i][j] is already stored. When i > j, then the count_2 is stored in count_2[j][i], which is the same as count_2[i][j] (since for x with S_x = {i,j}, the code would have sorted them as j < i, so stored in count_2[j][i]. So in code, for a pair (i,j) where i > j, the count_2[i][j] is zero, but count_2[j][i] is the correct value.

So to compute the count_2 component for any pair (i,j), we need to take the min and max of i and j, then look up count_2[min][max].

So in code:

for i in 0..q-1:

    for j in 0..q-1:

        if i == j: continue

        a = min(i, j)

        b = max(i, j)

        loss = count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[a][b]

        if loss < current_min:

            current_min = loss

But this loops through all q² pairs, which is 25 million for q=5000. For each pair, compute a and b, then access count_2[a][b], which is O(1).

But 25 million iterations may be manageable, but in Python, even that could be tight for a 2-second time limit. So perhaps we can optimize it by looping i < j and considering each pair once, but then the code would have to process O(q²/2) pairs, which is 12.5 million for q=5e3.

But in code, either way, the time should be manageable.

But to make it as efficient as possible, perhaps we can process all pairs (i,j) where i < j, compute the loss for (i,j) which is count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j], and then also consider the loss for (j,i) which is the same. Wait no, because (i,j) and (j,i) are the same pair, so we don't need to process them twice.

Ah, right! Because the pairs are unordered. So when we process (i,j) where i < j, that's the only pair. So the code should loop over all i < j, compute the loss for that pair, and track the minimum loss.

But that would miss the pairs where i and j are the same as (j,i), but since the code is considering all possible ordered pairs, we need to process all possible unordered pairs once.

Wait, no. Because (i,j) and (j,i) are the same pair. So the code should process each unordered pair once. So, the code can loop i from 0 to q-1, and j from i+1 to q-1. Then, for each such (i,j), compute the loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j]. Then, compare this loss to the current minimum.

But this approach would only process each unordered pair once. However, the code would miss the case where the pair (i,j) is (i,j) where i is j. Which is impossible because i and j are distinct.

So the code can process all pairs (i,j) where i < j, and for each such pair, compute the loss. The minimum of these would be the minimal loss.

But wait, this approach would not consider pairs where i and j are in any order. Because when i < j, the code processes (i,j). When j < i, it's processed as (j,i). So no, the code is correct.

Wait, no. Because for a pair (i,j) where i > j, in the code's approach, since we loop j from i+1 to q-1, and i starts from 0, then the pair (j,i) would be processed when i is j and j is i. So no. For example, i=3, j=2: j is not > i (3), so it's not processed. So the code would miss pairs where j < i.

Wait, the code loops for i in 0 to q-1, and j in i+1 to q-1. So for i=2, j=3, it's processed once. For i=3, j=2: since j must be i+1, and 2 < 3, the code does not process that pair. So the code is considering all pairs where i < j. So, each unordered pair is processed once. So the code will compute the loss for each unordered pair once.

But in reality, the pair (i,j) and (j,i) are the same. So the code is correct in processing each pair once.

But how does this affect the count_1 and count_2?

For example, pair (i,j) where i=1, j=2.

count_1[i] is the number of x covered only by i.

count_1[j] is the number of x covered only by j.

count_2[i][j] is the number of x covered exactly by i and j.

So for this pair, the loss is count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j], which is the correct loss.

For pair (j,i), which is (2,1), but since the code processes i < j, that pair is not processed. So the code correctly processes each unordered pair once.

So the code's approach of processing all i < j pairs is correct.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute T, the total coverage when all painters are included.

2. For each x, compute S_x.

3. For each x, if |S_x| is 1, add to count_1[i].

   if |S_x| is 2, add to count_2[i][j], sorted as i < j.

4. For all pairs i < j, compute the loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j].

5. Find the minimum loss among all these pairs.

6. The answer is T - min_loss.

So now, the problem reduces to how to compute T, and the count_1 and count_2 arrays efficiently.

So first, let's compute T.

Computing T requires merging all intervals of the painters and summing their lengths.

To merge the intervals:

- Collect all intervals (l_i, r_i) from the painters.

- Sort them based on l_i.

- Then merge overlapping or adjacent intervals.

For example:

Intervals after sorting:

[1,4], [3,5], [5,6], [5,7], [4,5]

Wait, but after sorting, they are ordered by l_i. Then, we can merge overlapping ones.

But in code:

We can sort the intervals by their starting point. Then, iterate through them, merging as we go.

Initialize a merged list with the first interval. For each subsequent interval, check if it overlaps with the last merged interval. If so, merge them, else add as a new interval.

So code for merging intervals:

merged = []
for interval in sorted_intervals:
    if not merged:
        merged.append(interval)
    else:
        last = merged[-1]
        if interval[0] <= last[1]:
            # overlap, merge
            new_start = last[0]
            new_end = max(last[1], interval[1])
            merged[-1] = (new_start, new_end)
        else:
            merged.append(interval)

Then, T is the sum of (end - start + 1) for each merged interval.

That's manageable.

Now, the code steps:

Read n and q.

Read q intervals, store as a list of tuples.

Compute T by merging these intervals.

Now, compute S_x for each x.

For x from 1 to n:

   S_x = list of painters (indices) whose interval includes x.

So for each x in 1..n:

   S_x = [i for i in range(q) if l_i <= x <= r_i]

But for q=5e3 and n=5e3, this is O(n*q) = 25e6 operations, which is acceptable.

But in Python, list comprehensions can be slow for such sizes. So perhaps precompute for each painter, their l and r, and for each x, iterate through all painters and check if x is in their interval.

Alternative approach: For each painter, during preprocessing, mark their coverage. For example, create a 2D array of size q x (n+2), but that would take O(qn) space, which is 25e6 for q=5e3 and n=5e3. But perhaps a better way.

Alternatively, for each x, collect all painters that cover x.

But in Python, perhaps using a list of lists. For each x in 1..n, have a list that starts empty. Then, for each painter i, iterate x from l_i to r_i, and append i to S[x].

But this would take O(q*(average interval length)) time. For painters with large intervals (e.g., covering all n sections), this would take O(qn) time. For q=5e3 and n=5e3, that's 25e6 operations. Which is manageable.

Yes. So:

sections = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # x ranges from 1 to n.

for i in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range(l, r+1):
        sections[x].append(i)

But for l=1 and r=5e3, this loop would take 5e3 iterations. For q=5e3 such painters, this would take 25e6 operations. Which is acceptable.

But in Python, this is O(q * average interval length). For intervals that are large (like 5000 elements), this could be slow.

Alternative approach: Using prefix sums.

We can represent each painter's interval as a start and end, and for each x, compute the painters that cover x using range inclusion checks.

So for each x in 1..n:

S_x = []
for i in range(q):
    if painters[i][0] <= x <= painters[i][1]:
        S_x.append(i)

But for q=5e3 and x=5e3, this is O(q) per x, leading to 25e6 operations, same as before.

But in Python, for loops are slower than list comprehensions. So perhaps using list comprehensions would be better.

Alternatively, precompute a list of painters' l and r, then for each x, use list comprehensions to generate S_x.

But regardless, this step is O(q*n), which for 5e3 * 5e3 = 25e6 is manageable.

Once S_x is computed for all x, proceed to compute count_1 and count_2.

Initialize count_1 as a list of zeros with length q.

Initialize count_2 as a 2D list of zeros, size q x q.

Then, for each x in 1..n:

    s = S_x
    if len(s) == 1:
        count_1[s[0]] += 1
    elif len(s) == 2:
        a, b = s
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        count_2[a][b] += 1

But wait, the list s may not be sorted. For example, for a painter i=3 and j=1, s could be [3,1]. So sorting them is necessary to have a <= b.

So code:

for x in 1..n:

    s = sorted(S_x)

    if len(s) == 1:

        count_1[s[0]] += 1

    elif len(s) == 2:

        a = s[0]

        b = s[1]

        count_2[a][b] += 1

So in this way, for each x with S_x of size 2, the two painters are sorted, and count_2 is incremented for the pair (a,b) where a < b.

Now, after this, for all pairs (i,j) where i < j, count_2[i][j] holds the number of x covered exactly by i and j.

Then, compute all pairs i < j and calculate their loss as count_1[i] + count_1[j] + count_2[i][j].

The minimal loss among these pairs is the one that, when excluded, results in the maximum coverage.

So the code's approach is:

Read the painters' intervals.

Compute T by merging all intervals.

Precompute S_x for each x.

Compute count_1 and count_2.

Loop over all i < j pairs, compute loss, track the minimum.

Answer is T - min_loss.

Now, the code steps.

Potential optimizations:

In Python, 2D lists can be initialized as lists of lists, but for q=5e3, a 5e3 x 5e3 list would require 25 million entries. Each being an integer. For Python, this is possible, but could consume significant memory. For example, each integer is 28 bytes (assuming a 64-bit Python), but in practice, Python uses more memory. So 25 million integers would be around 200 MB (assuming 8 bytes per int), which is acceptable given the 256 MB memory limit.

But in practice, using a list of lists in Python for count_2 may be memory-intensive. So perhaps using a dictionary of dictionaries for count_2 where only the pairs (i,j) with i < j and count_2[i][j] > 0 are stored. However, in the worst case, where all pairs are possible, this would not save memory. So for q=5e3, count_2 would be a 5e3 x 5e3 list of integers.

In Python, a list of lists can be created as:

count_2 = [[0] * q for _ in range(q)]

But for q=5000, this creates a list of 5000 lists, each of size 5000. That's 25 million entries, which may be manageable, but in Python it's possible that this uses a lot of memory.

Alternative approach: Since for count_2[i][j], i < j, perhaps we can use a triangular matrix, storing only j > i, and for j <= i, it's 0. But in code, this is what we already have.

So the code would proceed as follows.

Now, let's look at the sample input:

Sample 1:

7 5

1 4

4 5

5 6

6 7

3 5

The painters' intervals are:

Painter 0: 1-4

Painter 1: 4-5

Painter 2:5-6

Painter 3:6-7

Painter 4:3-5

Merging all intervals:

Painter 0: 1-4.

Painter 1's 4-5: merged into 1-5.

Painter 2's 5-6: merged into 1-6.

Painter 3's 6-7: merged into 1-7.

Painter4's 3-5: already covered by previous merged intervals.

So T is 7 sections.

Now, for each x, compute S_x.

For x=1:

covered by painter 0. So count_1[0] +=1.

For x=2: same as x=1.

x=3: covered by painter 0 and 4. So S_x is [0,4]. len=2. So count_2[0][4] +=1.

x=4: covered by 0,1,4. len=3. So no contribution.

x=5: covered by 1,2,4. len=3. No contribution.

x=6: covered by 2,3. len=2. So count_2[2][3] +=1.

x=7: covered by 3. len=1. count_1[3] +=1.

So count_1 is:

0: 2 (x=1 and 2)

3: 1 (x=7)

others are zero.

count_2:

0 and 4: 1 (x=3)

2 and 3: 1 (x=6)

Now, pairs:

We need to find the pair (i,j) that has the minimal loss. For example, pair (0,3):

loss = count_1[0] + count_1[3] + count_2[0][3] (which is zero, since they are not in count_2).

So loss is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.

Pair (0,4):

loss = 2 (count_1[0]) + 0 (count_1[4]) + 1 (count_2[0][4]) = 3.

Pair (2,3):

loss = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.

Pair (0,4) and (2,3) would have loss 3 and 2, respectively.

The minimal loss is 2, so T - loss = 7 - 2 =5. Wait, but sample output is 7.

Wait, what's wrong here?

Ah, sample input 1's output is 7, which suggests that there's a pair (i,j) that when excluded, the loss is 0. So T - 0 =7.

Ah, so in that case, the minimal loss is zero.

So perhaps my analysis is missing something.

Wait, let's re-express the problem.

The loss is the number of sections that are covered by i or j, and are not covered by any other painter except possibly i and j.

So for a pair (i,j), the loss is the number of sections that are covered by i or j, and when both are excluded, those sections are not covered by any other painter.

So in the sample input 1, when we exclude two painters such that their loss is zero, the total coverage remains T=7.

Looking back at sample input 1:

The solution is to exclude painters 0 and 4.

Wait, but in the sample input 1, the output is 7. So T is 7. Excluding two painters that contribute nothing to the loss. So their loss is zero.

How is that possible?

Because when we exclude painters i and j, there are other painters that cover all the sections they covered.

So perhaps the code's approach has a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine the sample input 1:

The painters are:

Painter 0: 1-4.

Painter 1:4-5.

Painter 2:5-6.

Painter 3:6-7.

Painter 4:3-5.

The merged intervals are 1-7, T=7.

Suppose we exclude painters 0 and 4.

The remaining painters are 1, 2, 3.

Their intervals:

Painter1:4-5.

Painter2:5-6.

Painter3:6-7.

Merging these gives 4-7. Total 4 sections. But that's not possible. Wait, what's the actual coverage when excluding 0 and 4?

Wait, painter 1 covers 4-5, painter 2 covers 5-6, painter3 covers 6-7.

Merged intervals:4-7. Total of 4 sections.

But sample input 1's output is 7, which is the same as T. So how?

Ah, perhaps the sample explanation is different.

Wait, in the sample input 1:

After excluding two painters, the coverage is 7. So the loss is zero. So which two painters are excluded?

Looking at the sample explanation, perhaps excluding painters 0 and 4 is not the case. Let's see.

Wait, let's think of the remaining painters as painters 1,2,3,4 (when excluding two others). Wait, no. When excluding two painters, we have q-2 =3 painters left.

Wait, sample input 1's output is 7. So the maximum possible coverage after excluding two painters is 7. So the same as T, which implies that the two excluded painters are such that their loss is zero.

Which means that those two painters are redundant: every section they cover is also covered by other painters.

So for example, painter 4 covers 3-5. But sections 3-5 are covered by painter 0 (3-4), painter 1 (4-5), painter4 (3-5). So if painter4 is excluded, but other painters cover those sections.

So if we exclude painter0 and painter4.

Then, the remaining painters are 1, 2,3,4's intervals are not included. Wait, no. Excluding painter0 and 4, the remaining painters are 1,2,3.

Their intervals are 4-5, 5-6, 6-7. Merged as 4-7. But that's only 4 sections. So the coverage is 4, but sample output is 7. So this is not possible.

Wait, what's the correct pair to exclude in sample input 1 to get coverage 7?

Ah, perhaps the pair is painter 0 and painter4. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial merging. Let me re-calculate T.

The painters are:

0: 1-4

1:4-5

2:5-6

3:6-7

4:3-5

The merged intervals:

Start with 0: 1-4.

Then painter4:3-5. Overlaps with 1-4. Merged to 1-5.

Then painter1:4-5. Already included in 1-5.

Then painter2:5-6. Merges to 1-6.

Then painter3:6-7. Merges to 1-7.

So T is 7.

Now, when excluding two painters:

Which two can we exclude so that the remaining painters still cover all 1-7?

For example, if we exclude painter0 and painter4.

The remaining painters are 1,2,3.

Their intervals:4-5,5-6,6-7.

Merged as 4-7. So coverage is 4 sections. But sample output is 7. So this is not the right pair.

Hmm. So how does the sample output achieve 7?

Maybe exclude painter0 and painter3.

Remaining painters:1,2,4.

Painters 1:4-5, 2:5-6,4:3-5.

Intervals:

3-5 (painter4), 4-5 (painter1), 5-6 (painter2).

Merged intervals:3-6.

But that's 3-6. Then painter2's 5-6 is merged with painter4's 3-5 and painter1's 4-5. So merged into 3-6. But painter2's interval is 5-6. So merged from 3-6. Then painter3's interval is excluded. So coverage is 3-6, which is 4 sections. Not 7.

Wait, what's the correct pair?

Perhaps the pair is painter0 and painter3. Then the remaining painters are 1,2,4.

Their intervals are 4-5,5-6,3-5. Merged as 3-6. So coverage is 4. But sample output is 7.

Wait, perhaps the correct pair is painter0 and painter2. Remaining painters:1,3,4.

Their intervals:4-5,6-7,3-5. Merged into 3-5 and 6-7. So total 5 + 2 =7.

Ah, yes. So when excluding painter0 and painter2, the remaining painters are 1,3,4.

Painter1:4-5.

Painter3:6-7.

Painter4:3-5.

Merged intervals:

3-5 (painter4 and 1), 6-7 (painter3). Total is (5-3+1) + (7-6+1) =3+2=5. Not 7.

Hmm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, excluding painter4 and painter3.

Remaining painters:0,1,2.

0's interval is 1-4.

1's is 4-5.

2's is 5-6.

Merged as 1-6. Coverage is 6. Not 7.

Wait, sample output is 7. How is that possible?

Ah! Maybe the pair excluded is painter3 and painter4. Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps excluding painter1 and painter4. Then remaining painters:0,2,3.

0:1-4, 2:5-6,3:6-7.

Merged as 1-4,5-7. Total is (4) + 3 =7.

Yes! So merged intervals are 1-4 and 5-7. Total 4+3=7. So coverage is 7. So T is 7, so the loss is 0.

So the pair is painter1 and painter4. When excluded, the loss is 0.

But why?

Because the sections covered by painter1 and painter4 are covered by other painters.

For example, painter1's interval is 4-5. When excluded, painter0 covers 1-4, painter4 covers 3-5. But if painter4 is also excluded, then painter0's coverage is 1-4. But painter2's interval is 5-6. So the merged intervals are 1-4,5-6,6-7. But when painter1 and painter4 are excluded, the remaining painters are 0,2,3.

Their intervals: 1-4,5-6,6-7.

Merged as 1-4,5-7. Total 4 + 3 =7.

So the loss for pair (1,4) is zero. Because when they are excluded, no sections that were covered by them are left uncovered by other painters.

So in this case, the loss is zero.

So how does the code compute this?

For each section x in painter1's or painter4's intervals (4-5 and 3-5), but when they are excluded, do other painters cover x?

Yes. For x in 3-5:

- Painter0 covers x=3-4.

- Painter4 covers x=3-5.

When excluding painter1 and 4, painter0 is present and covers x=3-4. Painter2 and 3 don't cover x=5.

Wait, painter2's interval is 5-6. So x=5 is covered by painter2.

So:

For x=4: covered by painter0 and painter1 and painter4.

Excluding painter1 and 4, painter0 covers x=4.

For x=5: covered by painter1, 2,4.

Excluding 1 and 4, painter2 covers x=5.

So in this case, sections covered by painter1 and 4 are covered by other painters when they are excluded. So their loss is zero.

So the code should compute that for pair (1,4), the loss is zero.

But how?

For each x in painter1's interval (4-5) or painter4's interval (3-5), check if x is covered by other painters when painter1 and 4 are excluded.

But according to the code's logic, the loss is count_1[1] + count_1[4] + count_2[1][4].

What is count_1[1] and count_1[4]?

count_1[i] is the number of sections x where S_x has exactly painter i.

For painter1:

S_x = {1} only for x in 4-5 where no other painter covers x. But in this case, painter0 covers x=4, and painter4 covers x=4-5. So x=4 is covered by painter0,1,4. So S_x has length 3. So x=4 is not in count_1[1].

x=5 is covered by painter1,2,4. So len(S_x)=3. So no.

So painter1 has count_1[1] =0.

Similarly, painter4 has count_1[4] =0.

count_2[1][4] is the number of sections x where S_x is {1,4}.

But for x in 4-5:

If painter0 is present (x=4) or painter2 (x=5), then S_x includes other painters. So the only x where S_x is {1,4} is x where only painter1 and 4 cover x.

But for x=4, painter0 also covers x. So S_x is {0,1,4} for x=4. For x=5, S_x is {1,2,4} for x=5.

So there are no x where S_x is {1,4}. So count_2[1][4] =0.

So the loss for pair (1,4) is 0 + 0 +0 =0.

Thus, the code would correctly calculate this pair's loss as zero. So the minimal loss is zero, leading to T - 0 =7.

So the code's logic is correct.

Thus, the code should correctly process this case.

Thus, the code steps are correct.

Now, the code implementation:

Read n and q.

Read q intervals, stored as a list of tuples.

Compute T by merging all intervals.

Precompute S_x for each x.

Compute count_1 and count_2.

Loop over all pairs i < j and compute loss.

Find the minimal loss.

Answer is T - minimal loss.

Now, implement this in Python.

But with q=5000, the code needs to handle 5e3 painters. The steps are feasible.

But the code for computing S_x for each x can be optimized.

But in Python, using a list comprehension for each x is feasible.

For example:

painters = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]

Then, for each x in 1..n:

s = [i for i in range(q) if painters[i][0] <= x <= painters[i][1]]

But with q=5e3 and n=5e3, this is 25 million operations. Which is manageable, but might be tight for Python's speed.

Alternative approach: Precompute for each painter i, their l and r, then for each x, loop through all painters and check if x is in their interval.

But again, in Python, this may be slow.

Alternative idea: For each painter, mark their coverage using prefix sums.

For example, create an array events of size n+2, initialized to 0. For each painter's interval l, r, increment events[l] by 1 and events[r+1] by -1. Then, compute the prefix sum to get the number of painters covering each x. But this would give the count of painters covering x, not their identities.

But we need the identities of the painters covering x, not just the count.

So this approach won't help for S_x.

Thus, the original approach is the way to go.

Now, code:

Read n and q.

Read q intervals.

Compute merged intervals for T.

Compute S_x for each x.

Compute count_1 and count_2.

Compute min_loss.

Output T - min_loss.

Now, code:

Sample input 3:

4 4

1 1

2 2

2 3

3 4

Output:3.

Merged intervals of all painters:

Painter0:1-1.

Painter1:2-2.

Painter2:2-3.

Painter3:3-4.

Merged intervals: 1-1, 2-4. T=1 +3=4.

Excluding two painters, the maximum coverage is 3.

For example, exclude painter0 and painter3: remaining painters 1 and 2.

Their intervals: 2-2 and 2-3. Merged into 2-3. Coverage is 2. No. Wait, what's the correct way to get 3?

Perhaps exclude painter1 and painter2.

Remaining painters are 0 and 3.

Intervals:1-1 and 3-4. Merged into two intervals:1-1 and 3-4. Coverage is 1 +2=3.

So the answer is 3.

In code:

T is 4.

count_1:

x=1: covered by painter0. count_1[0] +=1.

x=2: covered by painter1,2. len=2. So count_2[1][2] +=1.

x=3: covered by painter2,3. len=2. So count_2[2][3] +=1.

x=4: covered by painter3. count_1[3] +=1.

So count_1 is [1,0,0,1].

count_2:

(1,2):1, (2,3):1.

Now, pairs:

i=0 and j=1: loss=1+0 +0=1. T-1=3. So output is 3.

i=0 and j=2: loss=1+0 +0=1. T-1=3.

i=0 and j=3: loss=1+1 +0=2. T-2=2.

i=1 and j=2: loss=0+0 +1=1. T-1=3.

i=1 and j=3: loss=0+1 +0=1. T-1=3.

i=2 and j=3: loss=0+1 +1=2. T-2=2.

The minimal loss is 1. So T-1=3.

Thus, the code correctly outputs 3.

Thus, the code works.

Therefore, the code should handle all cases correctly.
