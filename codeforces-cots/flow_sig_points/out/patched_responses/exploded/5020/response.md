Okay, let's see. We need to reverse the process that Dima did. So the problem is: Dima applied several reverses, and now given the final array, we need to find the original one.

Wait, the process Dima did is steps where on step i, he reverses the segment from i-th to (n - i + 1)-th. And he does this while i <= n -i +1. So for each i starting from 1, until i is larger than (n -i +1), he reverses that segment. So the steps are for i=1,2,... up to some maximum m where m is the floor of (n+1)/2 divided by something? Hmm.

So for example, in the first sample input where n=7, the steps are i=1, then i=2, then i=3, then i=4. Wait, because for i=4, 4 <= 7-4+1 =4. So yes. Then step 4 is reversing the segment from 4 to 4 (since 7-4+1=4), which is a single element. So reversing it does nothing.

The key is to reverse the sequence of operations. So given the final array after all the reverses, we need to undo each of Dima's steps in reverse order. Because the process is a series of reverses applied in order. To reverse the process, we need to apply the inverse steps in the reverse order. Since reversing a segment again undoes it, if we apply the steps in reverse order (from the last step back to the first), each time reversing the same segment, we can get back to the original array.

So the plan is to:

1. Determine all the steps (i values) that Dima applied. The steps are i=1 to i=m, where m is the floor of (n+1)/2). Wait, let's see. For each i from 1 to m, where m is the maximum i where i <= n -i +1. Let's find m: i <= (n -i +1) → 2i <=n+1 → i <= (n+1)/2. So m = floor((n+1)/2). For example, n=7: (7+1)/2=4, so m=4. For n=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 → floor is 4. So m is 4 in that case.

So the steps are i=1,2,...,m. So the original process is for each i from 1 to m, reverse the segment from i to (n -i +1). To reverse the process, we need to apply the same steps again, but in reverse order. Because each step is a reverse, which is its own inverse. So applying the same steps again in reverse order would undo the changes.

Wait, but the steps are applied in order. For example, in the first sample, the steps are 1,2,3,4. So to undo them, we need to apply the reverses in reverse order: 4,3,2,1. Because applying step 4 again (reverse the segment from 4 to 4, which does nothing), then step 3 (reverse segment 3 to 5, which in the first sample's step 3 was reversed once, so reversing it again would undo that), etc.

Yes. So the approach is to apply the reverses again, starting from i=m down to i=1. Each time, reversing the same segment. Because each reverse is its own inverse, applying the same steps in reverse order will undo the original process.

So the problem reduces to:

Given the final array after applying reverses in order 1,2,...,m, we need to apply reverses in order m, m-1,...,1 to get back to the original array.

So the steps are:

For each i from m down to 1:

   reverse the segment from i to (n -i +1) (0-based or 1-based? The problem says the cubes are numbered from 1 to n. So in code, if the array is 0-based, then the i-th cube in the problem is index i-1 in the array.

So for example, in the first sample, the initial array after Dima's steps is [4,3,7,6,9,1,2]. To reverse the steps, we start from i=4 (since m=4). Then i=3, then 2, then 1.

Wait, m is (n+1)//2. For n=7, (7+1)//2=4. So m=4.

So for each i in m, m-1, ..., 1:

   reverse the segment from i to (n -i +1). So in code, the indices would be i-1 to (n -i +1 -1) = (n -i) in 0-based.

So for example, in the first sample, during the original steps:

i=1: reverse 1 to 7 (0-based 0 to 6). Then i=2: reverse 2 to 6 (0-based 1 to 5). Then i=3: reverse 3 to 5 (0-based 2 to 4). Then i=4: reverse 4 to 4 (no change).

So during the undoing, we need to reverse in the order i=4, then 3, then 2, then 1.

So the steps for undoing are:

i=4: reverse 4 to 4 (0-based 3 to 3). No change.

i=3: reverse from 3 to 5 (0-based 2 to 4). The current array after the original steps is [4,3,7,6,9,1,2]. So after reversing 3 to 5 (indices 2 to 4) in the first undo step (i=3):

Original array is [4,3,7,6,9,1,2]. Reverse indices 2-4: elements are 7,6,9 → reversed becomes 9,6,7. So the array becomes [4,3,9,6,7,1,2].

Then next step is i=2: reverse indices 1 to 5 (0-based). The array is [4,3,9,6,7,1,2]. Reversing indices 1-5 (elements 3,9,6,7,1 → reversed becomes 1,7,6,9,3). So the array becomes [4,1,7,6,9,3,2].

Then i=1: reverse the entire array. Reversing 0-6 (indices) gives [2,3,9,6,7,1,4]. Which is the correct original array.

So this approach works.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

- Read the current array.

- For i from m down to 1 (where m is (n+1)//2), reverse the segment from i-th to (n -i +1)-th position (1-based).

But how to do this efficiently?

The constraints are up to 2e5 elements. So reversing segments naively (like for each i, reverse a subarray) would take O(m * k), where k is the average segment length. For example, for m up to 1e5 and each segment up to 2e5 elements, this would be O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but each element is reversed in exactly certain steps. Let's think about how many times each position is reversed.

Each position in the array is part of some segments that are reversed during the steps. Each time a step i is applied, the segment from i to (n-i+1) is reversed. To undo that, we reverse the same segments in reverse order.

But when you reverse a segment multiple times, even or odd number of times, it matters. For example, reversing a segment twice is equivalent to not reversing it at all. So the key is to determine for each position, how many times it was reversed in the original process, then apply the same number of reverses again (since each undo step is a reverse again).

Wait, no. The original process applies reverses in order i=1 to m. To undo them, we need to apply reverses in order i=m down to 1. Because each reverse in the original process is being undone by reversing again in the reverse order.

But how to model this efficiently.

Wait, let's consider that each element in the array is part of some reverses during the original process, and during the undo steps. For each element at position j (1-based), how many times it is reversed in the original process plus the undo steps.

Wait, but the original steps are applied first (Dima's steps), then the undo steps (our reverses). Wait, no. The undo steps are our way to reverse Dima's process. So the input is the array after Dima's steps, and applying the undo steps (reverse in reverse order) gives the original array.

So for example, Dima's steps are i=1,2,3,4. Our undo steps are i=4,3,2,1. Each of these steps is a reverse. So the total effect is that the original array is obtained by applying these reverses to the input array.

So the process is:

original_array → apply Dima's steps (i=1 to m) → input array.

To get original array, we need to apply the reverse steps (i=m downto 1) → input array → apply those steps → original array.

So the problem is to apply the reverses in the reverse order of Dima's steps.

Now, the question is, how to efficiently compute the effect of all these reverses on each element.

Let's think about for each position j (1-based) in the array, how many reverses affect it. Each reverse is a segment [i, n-i+1], and during the undo steps, we process i from m down to 1.

For each j, the number of times it is reversed in the undo steps is equal to the number of steps i where i ≤ j ≤ (n - i + 1) and the step i is part of the undo steps (i from m down to 1).

Wait, but the undo steps are the same as the original steps, just in reverse order. So for each step i, during undo, we reverse the same segment [i, n-i+1].

But the original steps are i=1 to m. The undo steps are i=m downto 1.

Each such reverse in the undo steps affects the elements in [i, n-i+1].

So for each element j in the array, we can compute how many times it is included in a segment during the undo steps. If the count is even, then the element is not reversed (since two reverses cancel each other). If the count is odd, then the element is reversed once.

So the key idea is: for each position j (1-based), determine how many times it is included in a reverse segment during the undo steps. Then, if it's an odd number of times, the element's position in the input array is reversed (mapped to another position), and if even, it remains in the same position.

Wait, but each reverse affects the positions of elements in the segments. So each reverse changes the order, and subsequent reverses can affect the same elements again. So the order in which reverses are done affects the final positions.

This complicates things because the order matters. So the approach of counting the number of reverses for each position isn't sufficient, because the order in which reverses are applied affects how elements are swapped.

Thus, we need a way to model the effect of all these reverses in sequence, but in reverse order.

But for n up to 2e5, a naive approach of applying each reverse step is O(m * k), where k is the average segment length, which would be O(n^2) in the worst case (for m=1e5 and each step reversing 1e5 elements). Which is way too slow.

So, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the impact of all reverses on each element.

Alternatively, think about the path of each element through the reverses.

But that might be tricky.

Another approach: for each position in the original array (after undoing all steps), find out which position in the input array it comes from.

Wait, yes. Because each reverse step in the undo process is a series of reverses. So the input array is transformed by these reverses into the original array.

So, to find the original array, each element in the original array's position j is equal to the element in the input array's position after applying all undo steps.

So for each j in 0..n-1 (0-based), we need to compute where the element at j in the input array ends up after all the undo reverses. Then, the original array is the input array rearranged according to this mapping.

Alternatively, for each position in the original array, we can compute which position in the input array it corresponds to.

Let's model this as a function f(j) that gives the position in the input array of the element that ends up at position j in the original array.

If we can compute f(j) for each j, then the original array is [ a[f(0)], a[f(1)], ..., a[f(n-1)] ].

So the question is, how to compute f(j) for each j.

Each undo reverse step (i from m downto 1) reverses the segment [i, n-i+1] (1-based).

So, for each undo step, when we reverse a segment, the positions of elements within that segment are mirrored. For example, in a segment from l to r (1-based), the element at position x (l <=x <=r) is moved to position l + r -x.

So for each j, after each reverse in the undo steps, its position is changed according to whether it's inside the reversed segment.

So, to model the effect of all the reverses in the undo steps on each j, we can track how each j is transformed step by step.

But with m up to 1e5, and n up to 2e5, this would take O(m) per j, leading to O(mn) which is 2e10 operations. Not feasible.

So we need a mathematical way to compute the final position of j after all the reverses.

Let's think about the effect of reverses on a position j.

Each reverse on a segment [l, r] (1-based) will map the current position x to l + r - x if x is in [l, r]. Otherwise, x remains the same.

The order of reverses is important. So each reverse step i in the undo steps is applied in the order from m downto 1.

Let's model the position transformations step by step, but find a way to compute the final position of j without iterating each step.

Each undo step is a reverse of segment [i, n -i +1]. Let's denote l_i = i and r_i = n -i +1.

The steps are applied in order i = m downto 1.

So for each j, starting from the original position (which is the input array's j), after applying all reverses, we need to compute the position in the input array that ends up in j in the original array.

Alternatively, for each j in the original array's positions, the element comes from the input array's position after applying all the reverses (undo steps).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the position of j through all the reverse steps. For each undo step (i from m downto 1), we can compute how the current position of j is transformed.

For example, suppose j starts at j (original array's position), and then for each reverse step in the undo process (which is applied in reverse order of Dima's steps), j is transformed according to whether it is in the reversed segment of that step.

Wait, but the undo steps are applied to the input array to get the original array. So, the original array is input after applying all the undo steps. So for each j in the original array (0-based?), the element is taken from the input array at the position f(j), where f(j) is the position j would be after applying all the undo steps.

So, for each j in 0..n-1 (original array's position), we need to compute f(j), which is the position in the input array after applying all the undo reverses.

But how?

Let's model the process. Suppose we have the input array. Then, the undo steps are applied in order i=m downto 1. Each step reverses [i, n-i+1] (1-based). So to compute f(j) for the original array's position j (0-based?), let's track how the position changes through each step.

Wait, perhaps better to model this as 1-based positions for the steps.

Let's take j as the position in the original array (1-based). Then, after applying all undo steps, the element in j in the original array comes from the input array's position p, where p is obtained by applying all the reverses (undo steps) to j.

So, to find p, we can model the effect of each reverse step in the undo process on j.

Each reverse step (in the undo process) is applied in the order i from m downto 1. So for each i in m, m-1, ..., 1:

   if j is in [i, n -i +1], then j is mapped to i + (n -i +1) - j.

   else, j remains the same.

So, for example, after each reverse step, j's position is updated based on whether it was in the reversed segment.

So the question is, given all the reverses in the undo steps (i from m downto 1), what is the cumulative effect on j's position?

We need to compute the final position after applying all these reverses.

Hmm, but how?

Let's think of it as a series of transformations. Let's start with j_initial (the original array's position, 1-based) and then apply each reverse step in the undo process (i from m downto 1). Each step may or may not affect j_initial, changing it according to the reverse.

Wait, no. Because the undo steps are applied to the input array to get the original array. So the original array's position j is obtained by applying all undo steps to the input array. So to find the position in the input array that maps to j in the original array, we need to reverse all the undo steps. Because applying the undo steps to the input array gives the original array. So, to find which position in the input array corresponds to j in the original array, we need to apply the inverse of the undo steps to j. But since each undo step is a reverse (which is its own inverse), the inverse of the undo steps is the same as applying the steps again in the same order. So, perhaps not. Wait, the undo steps are a series of reverses. The inverse of that sequence is the same series of reverses, applied in reverse order. Because each reverse is its own inverse. So, for example, if the undo steps are R1, R2, R3 (in that order), then the inverse is R3, R2, R1. But in our case, the undo steps are applied in reverse order of Dima's steps. So the original Dima's steps are R1, R2, R3, ..., Rm. The undo steps are Rm, Rm-1, ..., R1. So applying the undo steps to the input array gives the original array. The inverse of the undo steps would be R1, R2, ..., Rm. So, to find the position in the input array that maps to j in the original array, we need to apply the inverse of the undo steps to j. Which is the same as applying R1, R2, ..., Rm to j. Because the inverse of applying Rm then Rm-1 ... R1 is applying R1 then R2 ... Rm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think with an example.

Suppose we have two reverses: first reverse A, then reverse B. To undo this, we first reverse B, then reverse A. So the undo steps are B followed by A. Now, the inverse of the undo steps would be A followed by B. So to find what position in the input array corresponds to j in the original array, we need to apply A then B to j.

But how does this work? Let's take a concrete example.

Suppose the original array is [a, b, c, d]. Dima's steps are reverse 1-4 (entire array → [d,c,b,a]), then reverse 2-3 (reverse [c,b] → [d,b,c,a]. The input array is [d, b, c, a]. The undo steps are to reverse 2-3 (which is step 2), then reverse 1-4 (step 1).

Undo steps:

First reverse 2-3 (elements b and c → [d, c, b, a].

Then reverse 1-4 → [a, b, c, d].

So the original array is [a,b,c,d]. The input array is [d,b,c,a]. Applying the undo steps (reverse 2-3, then reverse 1-4) gives [a,b,c,d].

Now, for the original array's position j=1 (a), in the input array, the element is at position 4 (1-based). But how is that determined?

The undo steps are:

Apply reverse 2-3: the array becomes [d, c, b, a].

Then apply reverse 1-4: the array becomes [a, b, c, d].

So the original array's position 1 (a) comes from the input array's position 4 (a in input is at position 4).

To find the mapping for j=1 (original array's position 1), we need to apply the inverse of the undo steps. The undo steps are reverse 2-3 then reverse 1-4. The inverse is reverse 1-4 then reverse 2-3.

So to find the inverse of the undo steps, we reverse the order and apply the steps. So applying reverse 1-4 and then reverse 2-3 to the original array's position j=1 (which is 1-based) gives the input array's position.

Wait, no. Because the original array is obtained by applying the undo steps to the input array. So the input array is the array after applying the inverse of the undo steps to the original array.

So, the original array = undo_steps(input array).

Thus, input array = inverse(undo_steps) (original array).

But the inverse of the undo steps is the steps applied in reverse order. Since each step is a reverse (which is self-inverse), the inverse of the undo steps is applying the same steps in reverse order. So the undo steps are R_m, R_{m-1}, ..., R_1. The inverse would be R_1, R_2, ..., R_m.

So, to compute the input array's position that maps to j in the original array, we need to apply R_1, R_2, ..., R_m to j.

So for each j in the original array's position (1-based), the corresponding input array's position is obtained by applying all R_i (for i from 1 to m) to j, in order.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Each R_i is a reverse of the segment [i, n-i+1]. So for each j, during each R_i step (i from 1 to m), if j is in the segment [i, n-i+1], then j is transformed to i + (n-i+1) - j. Otherwise, it remains the same.

The key is to compute the cumulative effect of applying all R_1, R_2, ..., R_m to j.

But with m up to 1e5, doing this naively for each j would be O(m) per j, which is O(1e5 * 2e5) = 2e10 operations. Which is way too slow.

So we need a mathematical approach to find, for each j, the final position after applying all R_i steps in order.

Let's see if there's a pattern or mathematical way to compute this.

For example, for a particular j, how many times is it reversed in the R_1 to R_m steps? Because each time it's in a segment, it's reversed once. But the order of these reverses matters, because each reverse changes the position of j, which may then be in other segments.

Alternatively, perhaps the order can be rephrased as a certain number of reverses that affect j.

Alternatively, think about the reverses in terms of layers. For each i, the segment [i, n-i+1] is reversed. The undo steps (which are processed in reverse order) are from i=m downto 1, but the R_i steps are from i=1 to m.

So when applying R_1 (i=1) first, then R_2 (i=2), and so on.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the initial Dima's steps. Because Dima's steps were R_1, R_2, ..., R_m. The undo steps are R_m, R_{m-1}, ..., R_1. So applying the inverse steps (the undo steps' inverse) is applying R_1, R_2, ..., R_m.

Which is exactly what Dima did in the first place. So the mapping from the input array to the original array is the same as applying Dima's steps again.

Wait, wait. Because the input array is the array after Dima's steps. To undo Dima's steps, we need to apply the inverse of Dima's steps. Dima's steps are R_1, R_2, ..., R_m. So the inverse is R_m, R_{m-1}, ..., R_1. But the undo steps are exactly that. So when we apply the undo steps (R_m, R_{m-1}, ..., R_1), we get the original array.

So applying the undo steps to the input array gives the original array.

But the problem is, how to compute for each position j in the original array, which position in the input array it comes from. Which is equivalent to applying the inverse of the undo steps to j. The inverse of the undo steps is R_1, R_2, ..., R_m. So the input array's position is obtained by applying R_1, R_2, ..., R_m to j.

So, for each j in the original array, the input array's position is f(j) = R_1(R_2(... R_m(j) ... )).

But computing this for each j is O(m) per j, which is too slow.

So there's a need to find a mathematical pattern or formula to compute f(j) efficiently.

Let's think about for a given j, how many times it's been included in the segments during the R_1 to R_m steps.

Each step R_i (i from 1 to m) reverses the segment [i, n-i+1].

So for j to be in this segment, i <= j <= n-i+1.

We need to find all i in 1..m where i <= j and j <= n-i+1.

Rewriting the inequalities:

i <= j → i <= j

j <= n -i + 1 → i <= n -j +1 → i <= (n -j +1)

So combining, i must be <= min(j, n-j+1).

Also, since i ranges from 1 to m = floor((n+1)/2), we can find for each j, the number of i's in 1..m that are <= min(j, n-j+1).

Wait, but m is the maximum i where i <= (n+1)/2. So for any i in 1..m, i <= (n+1)/2.

So for a given j, the condition i <= min(j, n-j+1) is equivalent to i <= j and i <= n-j+1.

But how does this help?

Wait, perhaps the number of times a position j is reversed in the R_1 to R_m steps is equal to the number of i's in 1..m that are <= min(j, n-j+1).

But how can we find this number?

For example, take j=3 in n=7. n-j+1=7-3+1=5. So min(3,5) is 3. So i can be 1,2,3. So there are 3 i's. So the number of reverses is 3. If this is odd, then the element is reversed an odd number of times.

Wait, but each time it is reversed, the position changes. So even if it's reversed an odd number of times, the final position depends on the order of the reverses.

But perhaps there's a pattern that after an even number of reverses, the element is back to its original position, and after an odd number, it's in the mirrored position.

But this is only true if all reverses are on the same segment. If the segments are different, the positions change in a way that isn't captured by just the parity of reverses.

So this line of thinking might not work.

Alternative approach: find for each j, after all R_1 to R_m steps, what is the final position.

Let's try to model this for a few examples.

Example 1: n=7, m=4.

For j=4 (1-based), what is the final position?

For each step R_i (i=1 to 4):

i=1: segment [1,7]. j=4 is in this segment. So after reversing, j becomes 1+7-4=4. So no change.

i=2: segment [2,6]. j=4 is in this segment. So after reversing, j becomes 2+6-4=4. No change.

i=3: segment [3,5]. j=4 is in this segment. Reversing gives 3+5-4=4. No change.

i=4: segment [4,4]. j=4 is here. Reversing (no change). So after all steps, j=4.

So the final position is 4. So the element at j=4 in the original array is taken from the input array's position 4.

In the first sample input, the input array is [4,3,7,6,9,1,2]. The original array is [2,3,9,6,7,1,4]. The element at position 4 (1-based) in the original array is 6, which is the same as in the input array.

So this matches.

Another example: j=1 (1-based) in n=7.

For each R_i step (i=1 to 4):

i=1: reverse [1,7]. j=1 becomes 1+7-1=7.

i=2: now j=7. Check if it's in [2,6]. 7>6, so no change.

i=3: j=7. [3,5], 7>5. No change.

i=4: [4,4]. No change.

So after all steps, j=7.

So the element at position 1 in the original array is taken from position 7 in the input array.

In the first sample, original array's first element is 2, which is input array's 7th element (2).

Yes.

Another example: j=2 (original array's position 2, which is 3). Let's track its steps.

i=1: j=2 → 1+7-2=6.

i=2: j=6 is in [2,6]. So 2+6-6=2.

i=3: j=2 is in [3,5]? No. So no change.

i=4: no change.

So final position is 2.

So the element at position 2 in the original array comes from input array's position 2 (which is 3 in the input array). Wait, but in the first sample input, the input array is [4,3,7,6,9,1,2]. The original array's position 2 is 3, which matches input array's position 2 (3).

Yes.

Hmm. So for j=1, the final position is 7. For j=2, the final position is 2.

But how to find this for general j.

Alternative approach: for each j, the number of reverses that affect it is the number of i's such that i <= min(j, n-j+1). But how to find the parity of this count. If it's even, the final position is j. If it's odd, then after an odd number of reverses, the position is mirrored around the center.

Wait, but in the previous examples, this isn't the case. For j=1 in n=7:

The count is the number of i's where i <= min(1, 7-1+1=7). min is 1. So i can be 1. So count is 1 (odd). So the position is mirrored. But the final position after applying R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4 steps is 7. Which is 1+7-1 =7, which is the mirror of 1 in the segment [1,7]. So for odd count, the position is mirrored in the first segment.

But the same j=1 is mirrored again in other steps? For example, in step i=2, j=7 is outside the segment [2,6], so no change. So the total count is 1.

So perhaps the final position of j is determined by the parity of the number of reverses affecting it. But how?

Alternatively, the final position of j after all R_i steps is:

For each i from 1 to m, if j is in [i, n-i+1], then j is transformed as follows.

But the order of reverses matters. For example, j is transformed in step i=1, then in step i=2, etc.

So perhaps the final position of j is equal to:

The number of i's where i <= j and i <= (n-j+1) is k.

If k is even, then j remains j. If k is odd, then j is mirrored across the first segment [1, n]. Or some other pattern.

But in the example of j=1, k=1 (odd), and final position is 7. Which is 1+7-1=7. So the mirror of j=1 in the first segment.

But for j=6 in n=7:

For each i:

i=1: j=6 is in [1,7], so transformed to 1+7-6=2.

i=2: j=2 is in [2,6], transformed to 2+6-2=6.

i=3: j=6 is in [3,5]? No. So no change.

i=4: no change.

So after steps, j=6 becomes 2 after i=1, then 6 after i=2. So the final position is 6.

But the count of i's where i <= min(6, 7-6+1=2). min is 2. So i can be 1 and 2. So count is 2, which is even. So j=6's final position is 6. Which matches.

But for j=2:

Steps:

i=1: j=2 becomes 1+7-2=6.

i=2: j=6 is in [2,6], becomes 2+6-6=2.

i=3: no change.

i=4: no change.

Final position 2.

Count is i=1 and i=2: 2, even. So j remains j.

Yes.

Another example: j=3 in n=7.

i=1: j=3 → 1+7-3=5.

i=2: j=5 is in [2,6] → 2+6-5=3.

i=3: j=3 is in [3,5] → 3+5-3=5.

i=4: no change.

Final position 5.

Count of i's where i <= min(3,7-3+1=5) → i can be 1,2,3. count=3 (odd). So final position is mirrored in the first segment.

But 3 → 5 after step i=1, then step i=2 transforms 5 to 3, step i=3 transforms 3 to 5. So after all steps, j=5.

But the count is 3 (odd), so according to parity, it would be mirrored once. But the actual path has multiple steps.

So this suggests that the parity approach is not sufficient.

Alternative approach: perhaps the final position of j after all R_i steps is equal to the initial j mirrored around the center of the array (if the number of reverses is odd), or remains j (if even).

But how?

The array's center is at (n+1)/2. For even n, there are two centers.

Mirroring around the center would mean that for a position j, the mirrored position is (n+1) - j.

But in the first example, j=1's final position is 7, which is (7+1) -1 =7. So that's mirrored.

j=3's final position is 5, which is 7+1-3=5. So yes.

j=5's final position would be 3.

So, in this case, the number of reverses for j=3 is 3 (odd), so mirrored once.

For j=5, count would be i<=min(5,7-5+1=3). min is 3. So i can be 1,2,3. count=3 (odd). So mirrored.

Yes, j=5 becomes 3.

So in this case, the final position is mirrored if the count is odd, and remains j if even.

So this seems to be a pattern.

So the key is, for each j, compute the number of i's in 1..m where i <= j and i <= (n-j+1). Let's call this count k. If k is odd, then the final position is (n+1) - j. If even, it's j.

But how to compute this count k.

Let's see.

For j, the count is the number of i's in [1, m] such that i <= j and i <= (n-j+1).

But since m is floor((n+1)/2), and for i > m, we don't consider them. So for each j, the count is the number of i's from 1 to min(m, min(j, n-j+1)).

But how to compute this.

Let me think. For a given j, let x = min(j, n-j+1). Then the count is the number of i's from 1 to min(m, x).

But since m is the maximum i for which i <= (n+1)/2, and x is min(j, n-j+1), which can be up to floor((n+1)/2), because for j <= (n+1)/2, min(j, n-j+1) =j. For j > (n+1)/2, min(j, n-j+1) =n-j+1.

So for j <= (n+1)/2, x =j. For j> (n+1)/2, x= n-j+1.

But since m = floor((n+1)/2), then for j <=m, x=j. For j >m, x =n-j+1.

So, the count for j is:

if j <=m:

count = j.

Wait, wait. Because i ranges from 1 to m, which is floor((n+1)/2). So if j <=m, then min(j, n-j+1) is j (since j <=m <= (n+1)/2 → n-j+1 >= (n+1)/2 -j +j +1 ? No, wait. For example, n=7, j=3 (m=4). n-j+1=5, which is greater than j=3. So min(3,5)=3. So j<=m implies min(j, n-j+1) =j. So for j<=m, x=j.

So for j <=m, the count is the number of i's from 1 to j, since i must be <=j and <=n-j+1 (which is >=j for j<=m). So i can be up to j.

So count for j<=m is j.

For j>m:

x= n-j+1.

i must be <=x and <=m.

But since j>m, x =n-j+1. For example, j=5 in n=7: x=7-5+1=3. m=4. So x=3. So i can be up to 3.

So count is the number of i's from 1 to min(m, x) =3.

So count=3.

But for j=5 in n=7, the count is 3 (i=1,2,3).

So for j>m:

count = min(m, x).

But x= n-j+1.

So the count is min(m, n-j+1).

But since j>m and m = floor((n+1)/2), then n-j+1 could be >=m or not.

Wait, let's take n=8. m=4 (floor(9/2)=4).

j=5. x=8-5+1=4. min(m, x) =4. So count=4.

But for i=1, 2,3,4: check if i <=n-j+1=4. All yes. So count=4.

So count is min(m, n-j+1).

So overall, for each j:

count = min(m, min(j, n-j+1))).

But how to compute this.

So the count is:

if j <=m: count =j.

else: count = n-j+1.

But for j>m, n-j+1 may be less than m.

Wait, no. For j>m in n=7: j=5, m=4. n-j+1=3 < m=4. So count=3.

But in n=8, j=5: x=4, m=4. So count=4.

So for j>m, count is n-j+1.

But since for j>m, j >=m+1. For even n: n=8, m=4. j>4 → j=5,6,7,8.

n-j+1 for j=5:4, j=6:3, j=7:2, j=8:1.

So for j>m, count= n-j+1.

But if n-j+1 >m, then count is m.

Wait, no. For example, n=9, m=5.

j=6 (which is>m=5). x= n-j+1=9-6+1=4. m=5. So min(5,4)=4. So count=4.

So in this case, for j>m, the count is min(m, x)=x=4.

But why?

Because x= n-j+1.

So for j>m:

count = min(m, x) = x if x <=m.

But x= n-j+1.

But j>m → j >=m+1.

n-j+1 = (n+1) -j.

Since j >=m+1 and m= floor((n+1)/2):

For even n:

n=2k. m= (2k+1)/2 → k+0.5 → floor to k.

Wait, no. For even n=8, m= floor( (8+1)/2 )=4.5 → 4.

So for j>4 (m=4), j=5.

n-j+1=8-5+1=4. Which is equal to m=4. So min(m, x) =4.

So count=4.

But x=4= m.

So for j>m, the count is min(m, n-j+1).

Which could be equal to n-j+1 or m.

But how to generalize.

Alternatively, for j>m:

n-j+1 = (n+1) -j.

Since j>m, and m= floor((n+1)/2), then (n+1)/2 >=m.

If n is even, n=2k. Then m= k. So n-j+1= 2k+1 -j.

j ranges from k+1 to 2k.

For j= k+1: x=2k+1 - (k+1) =k.

Which is equal to m=k. So count is k.

For j=k+2: x=2k+1 - (k+2) =k-1 <m.

So count is x= k-1.

So for j>m, the count is min(m, x), which can be m or x, depending on j.

But this seems complicated.

But perhaps there's a way to find that for j <=m: count =j.

For j>m: count= n-j+1.

But this isn't always true. For example, j=5 in n=8 (m=4):

count=4 (n-j+1=4) which is equal to m=4.

But for j=6 in n=8:

count=3, which is n-j+1=3 < m=4.

But m=4, so min(m, 3)=3. So count=3.

So for j>m, count= n-j+1.

Yes. Because when j>m, n-j+1 is less than or equal to m.

Because m= floor( (n+1)/2 ), and j>m implies j >= m+1.

For even n=2k: m= k.

j >=k+1.

n-j+1= 2k+1 -j.

But j >=k+1 → 2k+1-j <=k.

So for even n, j>m → n-j+1 <=m.

For odd n=2k+1: m= k+1.

j >=k+2.

n-j+1= 2k+2 -j.

j >=k+2 → 2k+2-j <=k.

Which is <=k+1 (m= k+1).

So yes, in all cases, for j>m, n-j+1 <=m.

So for j>m, the count is n-j+1.

So combining all:

count = min(j, n-j+1) for j <=m.

count = n-j+1 for j>m.

But since for j <=m, n-j+1 >=j (since j<=m <= (n+1)/2 → n-j+1 >= (n+1)/2 -j +j +1 ? Not sure. But for j <=m, n-j+1 >=j.

For example, j=3 in n=7: n-j+1=5 >=3.

Yes.

So for j<=m, count= j.

For j>m, count= n-j+1.

So the total count is count = min(j, n-j+1, m).

Wait, no. Because for j>m, count= n-j+1.

But for j<=m, count= j.

So the count is for each j:

count = j, if j <= (n+1)/2.

count = n-j+1, if j> (n+1)/2.

But since m is floor((n+1)/2), for j<=m, j <= (n+1)/2.

So the count is j for j<=m, and n-j+1 for j>m.

So the parity of the count determines whether the position is mirrored.

If count is even: no mirroring.

If count is odd: mirroring.

So the final position is:

if count is even: j.

if count is odd: (n+1) -j.

This is a crucial insight.

Because when you reverse a segment an even number of times, it's as if you didn't reverse it. An odd number of times is a single reverse.

But how does this hold given that the reverses are applied in order?

Wait, in the example of j=3 in n=7, count is 3 (odd). So final position is 7+1-3=5.

Yes.

Another example: j=2 in n=7, count=2 (even). Final position is 2.

Yes.

j=5 in n=7, count=3 (odd). Final position is 3 (7+1-5=3).

Yes.

j=6 in n=7, count=2 (even) → final position 6.

Yes.

So this seems to hold.

Thus, the algorithm can be:

For each j in 1..n (1-based):

   compute count = j if j <= m else (n-j+1).

   if count is odd: original array's j-th element is input_array's (n+1-j)-th element.

   else: original array's j-th element is input_array's j-th element.

Wait, but why? Because if the count is odd, the element has been reversed an odd number of times, so it's mirrored across the center. So its position in the input array is (n+1-j).

But how does this work for even counts?

For example, j=2 in n=7: count=2 even. So the element stays in position 2.

Yes.

But how does this align with the previous example where j=3 in n=7: count=3 odd → position 5.

Which is (7+1 -3) =5.

Yes.

So the final position of j in the input array is:

if count is even: j.

if count is odd: n+1-j.

So, for each j in 1..n (original array's position), the element comes from the input array's position f(j), where f(j) is j if the count is even, or n+1-j if count is odd.

Thus, the solution is:

Compute for each j in 1..n:

count = j if j <= m else (n -j +1).

if count is odd: the original array's j-th element is a_input[n+1 -j -1] (0-based).

else: a_input[j-1].

But why?

Because the input array is 0-based. So for 1-based j, in 0-based it's j-1.

So for j=1 in 1-based: 0-based 0.

So, the code would be:

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
m = (n + 1) // 2
res = [0]*n

for j in range(1, n+1):
    if j <= m:
        cnt = j
    else:
        cnt = n - j + 1
    if cnt % 2 == 1:
        res[j-1] = a[n - j]
    else:
        res[j-1] = a[j-1]

print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

But wait, let's test this code against the sample input.

First sample input:

7

4 3 7 6 9 1 2

m =4.

For j=1: cnt=1 (odd). So res[0] = a[7-1 -0? Wait, wait, for j=1 in 1-based, the 0-based index is 0. n-j is 7-1=6. So a[6] is 2. Which matches the sample output's first element.

Yes.

j=2: cnt=2 even. res[1] = a[1] =3. Which matches sample output.

j=3: cnt=3 (odd). res[2] = a[7-3=4] which is 9. Which matches.

j=4: cnt=4 even. res[3] =a[3] =6.

j=5: cnt =7-5+1=3 (odd). res[4] =a[7-5=2] → a[2]=7.

But in the sample output, the fifth element is 7. Yes.

Wait, the sample output is [2,3,9,6,7,1,4].

Original array's fifth position (j=5) is 7. According to the code, j=5> m=4. So cnt=7-5+1=3 (odd). So res[4] (0-based) is a[7-5=2] → a[2] is 7. Which is correct.

Yes.

j=6: cnt=7-6+1=2 (even). res[5] =a[5] =1. Which matches.

j=7: cnt=7-7+1=1 (odd). res[6] =a[7-7=0] → a[0]=4. Which matches.

So the code works for the first sample.

Second sample input:

8

6 1 4 2 5 6 9 2

The output should be 2 1 6 2 5 4 9 6.

Let's compute for each j.

n=8, m= (8+1)//2 =4.5 → 4.

For j=1:

cnt=1 (<=4). odd. so res[0] =a[8-1-1=6? Wait, wait: j=1 in 1-based is index 0. n-j=8-1=7. 0-based index is 7. So a[7] is 2. Which is the first element of the output.

Yes.

j=2:

cnt=2 even. res[1] =a[1] =1.

Yes.

j=3: cnt=3 (odd). res[2] = a[8-3=5 → index 5 is 6. Which is the third element of the output (6).

Yes.

j=4: cnt=4 even. res[3] =a[3]=2. Which matches.

j=5: cnt=8-5+1=4. even. res[4] =a[4]=5.

Yes.

j=6: cnt=8-6+1=3. odd. res[5] =a[8-6=2 → index 2 is4. Which is the sixth element of the output (4).

Yes.

j=7: cnt=8-7+1=2 even. res[6] =a[6]=9.

Yes.

j=8: cnt=8-8+1=1. odd. res[7] =a[8-8=0 → a[0]=6. Which is the last element of the output (6).

Yes.

So the code works for the second sample.

Thus, the code is correct.

The time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

The space complexity is O(n) as well.

Thus, this is the optimal approach.
