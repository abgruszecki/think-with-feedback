<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about determining for each target which was the first shot that hit it, and then outputting the count of hit targets along with their first hit indices.

First, let's understand the problem. We have n targets, each being a circle on the Ox axis. The circles don't overlap or nest, but can touch. Then, m shots are fired at various points. For each target, we need to find the earliest (smallest index) shot that lies inside or on the circle. If no such shot exists, output -1.

The key constraints here are the sizes of n and m. n can be up to 10^4 and m up to 2e5. So any O(n*m) approach would be way too slow. For example, 1e4 * 2e5 = 2e9 operations, which is definitely not feasible within a 1-second time limit.

So, we need a more efficient approach. Let's think about how to structure the data.

Each target is a circle on the Ox axis. So the circle's equation is (X - x)^2 + y^2 <= r^2. Since the center is (x, 0), the y-coordinate of the shot's point must satisfy y^2 <= r^2 - (X - x)^2. Wait, but for a shot (a, b), the distance squared from the center is (a - x)^2 + b^2. For the shot to be inside the circle, this must be <= r^2.

So for each shot, we can compute for which targets it is inside. But again, checking all targets per shot is O(mn), which is too slow.

Alternative approach: Preprocess the targets in such a way that for each shot, we can quickly find which targets it hits.

But how?

Since the targets are non-overlapping and ordered along the Ox axis (since they can't intersect or be nested), maybe we can sort them by their leftmost and rightmost points. Then, for a given shot, we can check which targets' x ranges include the x-coordinate of the shot, adjusted for the y.

Wait, but the shot's position is (a, b). The distance from the center x_i is sqrt( (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 ). But the radius is r_i. So the shot hits target i if (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

But how can we efficiently find for a given (a, b) all i where this inequality holds?

Hmm. Let's think of this as for each shot, we need to find all targets i where (a - x_i)^2 <= (r_i^2 - b^2). Because (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2 is equivalent to (a -x_i)^2 <= (r_i^2 - b^2). So for each shot, compute s = b^2. Then for each target, check if (a - x_i)^2 <= (r_i^2 - s). But again, this is O(n) per shot, which is not feasible.

But since the targets are arranged along the Ox axis (since they can't overlap or be nested, they must be placed in non-overlapping intervals along the x-axis). So the targets are sorted in a way that their intervals on the x-axis don't overlap and are in order.

So each target can be represented as an interval [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i], and these intervals are non-overlapping and ordered. So when sorted by their starting x coordinates, they form a sequence of intervals that don't overlap.

So, given this, when a shot (a, b) is fired, the possible targets it can hit are those where the x coordinate of the shot's projection onto the Ox axis (i.e., (a, 0)) lies within the target's interval. But wait, because the actual distance from the center is determined by both the x and y coordinates.

Wait, but for a shot (a, b), the x-coordinate of the shot's projection onto the Ox axis is a. But even if a is within a target's interval, the shot's y-coordinate might be too large. So the idea is that the x interval for a shot (a, b) is the set of x_i where (a - x_i)^2 <= r_i^2 - b^2. However, r_i^2 - b^2 must be >=0, otherwise, the shot's y is larger than the radius, so the shot can't hit the target.

So for a given shot (a, b), first compute b_squared = b^2. Then, for each target, if r_i^2 < b_squared, then the shot can't hit this target. Otherwise, the x_i must satisfy (a - x_i)^2 <= (r_i^2 - b_squared). Taking square roots, this implies that x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 - b_squared), a + sqrt(r_i^2 - b_squared)].

But this seems complicated. Wait, maybe for each shot (a, b), the valid x_i ranges are [a - d, a + d], where d = sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2) if r_i^2 >= b^2. But for each target, this d is different. So for a shot, the possible x_i that could be hit are those where x_i is in the interval [a - d_i, a + d_i], where d_i is sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2) if r_i^2 >= b^2. Otherwise, no.

But again, checking all targets is O(n), which is too slow.

So, the problem is: for each shot (a, b), find all targets i where (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2. How can we do this efficiently?

Alternative approach: Since the targets are sorted in order along the x-axis (since they can't overlap and are non-nested), perhaps we can perform a binary search to find possible candidates.

Each target's interval [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i] is non-overlapping and ordered. So if we sort the targets by their starting x (leftmost point), then their intervals are in order and non-overlapping.

So, for a shot (a, b), we can compute for each target i whether (a, b) is inside. To do this efficiently, perhaps for each shot, find the targets whose intervals on the x-axis include a, but adjusted for the shot's y-coordinate.

Wait, but even if the x is in the interval, the y might be too large. So perhaps the approach is:

For each shot (a, b), compute the maximum possible x_i range that the target can have. For example, (a - x_i)^2 <= (r_i^2 - b^2). So x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2)]. But this is per target, which again seems O(n).

But how can we find the targets that contain a in their x-interval (considering the y component)?

Another idea: For each shot (a, b), the set of possible targets that could include this shot is those where:

x_i - r_i <= a <= x_i + r_i (the x projection of the shot is within the target's interval), and the distance from (a, b) to (x_i, 0) is <= r_i.

Wait, but the x projection being in the target's interval is a necessary condition for the shot to be inside the target, but not sufficient. Because even if a is within [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i], the y might be such that the distance is larger than r_i. So the x interval is a necessary condition, but not sufficient.

But perhaps we can use this to narrow down the possible targets. So for a given shot (a, b), first find all targets where a is in their [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i] interval. Then, among those targets, check if (a -x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

But how to find the targets that include a in their interval quickly?

Since the targets are sorted in order of their intervals, and their intervals are non-overlapping, we can perform a binary search to find which intervals (if any) a falls into.

Wait, but each target's interval is [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i], and the intervals are non-overlapping. So the entire collection of intervals is a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals. So if we sort the targets by their left endpoint, then the right endpoints are also in order (since they don't overlap). So for example, if target 1 is [2,5], target 2 is [6, 10], etc. So for a given a, there can be at most one target whose interval contains a. Because the intervals are non-overlapping and ordered. Wait, but no, if two intervals touch each other, then the left end of one is the right end of another. But in that case, a point exactly at the boundary (like x=5) would belong to the second interval if the first ends at 5 and the next starts at 5.

But according to the problem statement, it's possible for targets to touch each other, but not overlap. So their intervals can be adjacent. So a point at the boundary between two targets may belong to both. Wait, but the problem says that the targets are circles arranged on the Ox axis. So if two targets touch, their circles touch. For example, two circles with centers x1 and x2, and radii r1 and r2. The distance between centers is (x2 -x1) = r1 + r2. So the intervals are [x1 - r1, x1 + r1] and [x2 - r2, x2 + r2] = [x1 + r1, x2 + r2], which are adjacent. So a point at x1 + r1 would belong to both intervals. But according to the problem statement, the circles are non-overlapping and non-nested. So any two circles are either separate (distance between centers > r1 + r2) or touching (distance = r1 + r2). So their intervals on the x-axis are either non-overlapping and not adjacent, or adjacent (touching). But in the case of adjacent intervals, the point where they touch is part of both circles.

But when considering the shot (a, b), if a is at x = x1 + r1, then which target does it belong to? Both? Because the distance from (x1,0) to (a, b) would be sqrt(r1^2 + b^2) if b is not zero. Wait, no. Wait, the circle for the first target is (x - x1)^2 + y^2 <= r1^2. So at the point (x1 + r1, 0), the y is zero, so (x -x1)^2 = r1^2, which is equal to the radius squared. So that point is on the boundary of the first circle. Similarly, for the second target, if it's centered at x2 = x1 + r1 + r2 (since they are touching), then the left end is x2 - r2 = x1 + r1 + r2 - r2 = x1 + r1. So the point x1 + r1 is the left end of the second target's interval and the right end of the first's. So the point x1 + r1 is part of the first target's interval. Wait, no. Let me see: the first target's interval is [x1 - r1, x1 + r1], and the second's is [x2 - r2, x2 + r2]. But x2 = x1 + r1 + r2 (because they touch). So x2 - r2 = x1 + r1. So the first target's interval ends at x1 + r1, and the second's starts at x1 + r1. So a point at x = x1 + r1 would belong to both intervals. But according to the problem statement, circles cannot overlap, but can touch. However, when two circles touch, the point of contact is part of both circles. So in such a case, a shot at (x1 + r1, 0) would hit both targets. But according to the problem statement, it's possible for a shot to hit multiple targets. So the output needs to consider for each target whether the shot hit it.

But in the problem's sample input 1, the output for the third shot (3,0) hits the second target (5,2). The shot (3,0) is 2 units away from center 5: (5-3)^2 +0^2 =4 <= 2^2? Wait, 2^2 is 4, so 4 <=4, yes. So yes, it hits the second target.

But back to the problem. So, for a given shot (a, b), how can we find all targets i where (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2. Since the targets are arranged along the Ox axis and their intervals are non-overlapping (except possibly at endpoints), perhaps the following approach can work:

For each shot (a, b):

1. Compute the maximum possible x_i such that (a - x_i)^2 <= r_i^2 - b^2. This requires that r_i^2 >= b^2. So, for each shot, first check if b^2 > r_i^2. If so, this shot can't hit the target.

But again, this is O(n) per shot. Which is not feasible.

Alternative plan: Preprocess the targets in a sorted list of their x intervals, then for each shot, perform a binary search to find possible targets that could include the shot's x coordinate (a) in their x interval (adjusted for the y coordinate).

Wait, but the y coordinate affects the allowable x range. For a given target i, the allowable x range for the shot is [x_i - sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), x_i + sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2)] only if r_i^2 >= b^2. Otherwise, the shot can't hit it.

But how do we find, for a given a and b, all targets i where (a - x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

Let me rephrase this inequality:

x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2)], but only if r_i^2 >= b^2.

But this is a per-target condition. Since the targets are sorted, perhaps we can compute for each shot (a, b), the x_i's that lie within this interval for some target i. But how?

Alternatively, for each shot (a, b), the condition can be rewritten as x_i must be within [a - sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2)].

But for each target i, this is a different interval. So it's not straightforward to precompute.

Another idea: For each shot (a, b), compute s = b^2. For each target i where r_i^2 >= s, compute the maximum allowed distance from a to x_i. The allowed distance is sqrt(r_i^2 - s). So x_i must be in [a - d, a + d], where d is sqrt(r_i^2 - s). Then, for each target i where x_i is in this interval, the shot is a hit.

But how to find such targets efficiently?

Since the targets are sorted along the x-axis (their centers are in order, but perhaps not. Wait, no. The problem says that the circles are non-overlapping and non-nested. So their intervals on the Ox axis (x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i) are non-overlapping and ordered. So the targets can be sorted by their starting x coordinate (x_i - r_i), and this list will be in increasing order.

So, the list of targets is sorted by their left x coordinate.

So for a given shot (a, b), we can precompute s = b^2. Then, for each target i where r_i^2 >= s, compute the interval [a - d_i, a + d_i], where d_i = sqrt(r_i^2 - s). Then, any target i whose x_i is within this interval would have the shot (a, b) hit it. But how to find such x_i's efficiently.

But even this seems challenging. Because each target i has a different d_i, so the interval for each target is different.

Alternative approach: For each shot (a, b), compute s = b^2. Then, for each target i:

If r_i^2 < s: skip.

Else: check if (a - x_i)^2 <= r_i^2 - s. Which is equivalent to (x_i -a)^2 <= (r_i^2 -s). So x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 -s), a + sqrt(r_i^2 -s)].

But again, this is O(n) per shot.

So this is O(mn), which is 2e5 * 1e4 = 2e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, we need a smarter way.

Let me think again about the sorted list of targets. Since their intervals on the Ox axis are non-overlapping and sorted, their centers are in an order such that each next target's left x coordinate (x_i - r_i) is greater than or equal to the previous target's right x coordinate (x_{i-1} + r_{i-1}).

So the centers of the targets are arranged in such a way that the intervals are non-overlapping and ordered. So the list of targets can be sorted by their left x coordinate (x_i - r_i), which is increasing.

So the centers x_i are in the order that their intervals do not overlap.

Given that, perhaps we can for each shot (a, b), compute the possible x_i centers that could satisfy (a -x_i)^2 +b^2 <= r_i^2.

But how?

Let's rearrange the inequality:

x_i^2 - 2 a x_i + a^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

But that's a quadratic in x_i: x_i^2 - 2a x_i + (a^2 + b^2 - r_i^2) <=0.

The roots of the equation x_i^2 -2a x_i + (a^2 + b^2 - r_i^2) =0 are:

x_i = [2a ± sqrt(4a^2 - 4*(a^2 + b^2 - r_i^2))]/2

Simplify discriminant:

4a^2 -4*(a^2 + b^2 - r_i^2) =4 (a^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - r_i^2))=4(r_i^2 -b^2).

So the roots are:

[2a ± sqrt(4(r_i^2 -b^2)) ] /2 = a ± sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2).

Thus, the inequality x_i^2 -2a x_i + (a^2 +b^2 - r_i^2) <=0 holds when x_i is in the interval [a - d, a +d], where d= sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), provided that r_i^2 >=b^2.

So, for a shot (a,b), the x_i centers of targets must lie in [a -d, a +d], where d = sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2). But since d is dependent on r_i and b, each target has its own interval. This complicates things.

But perhaps for a given shot (a, b), we can compute the maximum possible d for a target i, given that r_i^2 >=b^2. Then, for each target i, if x_i is in [a -d_i, a +d_i], then the shot hits.

But since d_i is sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), and r_i varies per target, this approach is not directly helpful.

Alternative idea: For each target i, the x_i is fixed. So for a shot (a, b), the condition is (a -x_i)^2 +b^2 <= r_i^2. Which can be rewritten as (x_i -a)^2 <= r_i^2 -b^2. So for each target i where r_i^2 >=b^2, check if x_i is in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2)].

But again, for each shot, this requires checking each target, which is O(n).

Thus, this approach is O(mn), which is not feasible.

So we need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Preprocess the targets into a structure that allows us to query for x_i in a certain range. For example, sort the targets by their x_i, and then for a given a and d (which depends on the shot and target's r_i), perform a binary search to find targets in x_i in [a -d, a +d]. But since d varies per target, this is not directly applicable.

Wait, but for each shot (a, b), the d_i for each target i is sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), but only if r_i^2 >=b^2. So for a given shot, the set of targets i that can be hit is those where:

r_i^2 >=b^2 and x_i is in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2)].

But how can we find such targets?

Another idea: For a given shot (a, b), compute all possible targets i where:

x_i >= a - sqrt(r_i^2 - b^2), and x_i <= a + sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2).

But how can we find these x_i efficiently?

Perhaps, for each target i, precompute some structure that allows us to check if x_i is in the required interval for a shot. But I'm not seeing a way to do this.

Alternative plan: For each target i, precompute the possible (a, b) that would hit it. But this is not feasible.

Alternative approach: For each shot, first compute the possible x_i ranges where x_i can be in [a -d_i, a +d_i], but d_i is sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2) for each i. But this seems difficult.

Wait, but since the targets are sorted by their intervals on the x-axis, perhaps we can find the targets whose intervals [x_i -r_i, x_i + r_i] intersect with the line y=0. But the shot's (a, b) is a point. But for the shot to hit a target, the distance from (a, b) to (x_i, 0) must be <= r_i.

Hmm.

Alternatively, for each shot (a, b), the set of possible targets that can be hit is those for which the point (a, b) lies inside or on the circle. To compute this efficiently, perhaps use spatial partitioning or some spatial data structure.

But since the targets are circles arranged along the Ox axis, perhaps we can model them as intervals and find possible overlaps.

Another idea: For each shot (a, b), compute the maximum possible radius r such that a circle centered at (a, b) with radius r would intersect any of the target circles.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the distance between the shot's point (a, b) and the target's center (x_i, 0) is sqrt( (a -x_i)^2 + b^2 ). So for the shot to hit the target, this must be <= r_i. So, for each shot, we need to find all targets i where (a -x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

But this is the same as x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2)].

But this is per target, which again seems O(n).

Wait, but the targets are sorted by x_i - r_i. So perhaps for each shot (a, b), we can find targets where x_i is in a certain range. But since the x_i's are part of a sorted array, perhaps we can perform a binary search to find possible candidates.

For example, for a shot (a, b), and a target i, the x_i must be in [a - sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2), a + sqrt(r_i^2 -b^2)].

But since r_i varies per target, this is not a fixed interval. However, the targets are sorted, so if we can find a way to compute for each shot, a possible x_i range that includes all possible x_i's that could satisfy the condition, perhaps we can find the relevant targets via binary search.

Alternatively, for each target i, precompute a range for a, but again, this seems difficult.

Let me think of the problem differently. Since the targets are sorted by their left x coordinate (x_i - r_i), perhaps for a shot (a, b), the x coordinate a must be within the target's x interval [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i] to possibly hit the target (but also considering y). So first, for a shot (a, b), find the targets whose x interval includes a. Then, among those targets, check if the distance from (a, b) to (x_i, 0) is <= r_i.

So, step 1: find all targets whose x interval includes a. Since the targets are sorted by their left x, this can be done via binary search. Then, for each such target, check if (a -x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

This would reduce the number of targets to check per shot from n to a few (since the targets are non-overlapping, a can be in at most one target's x interval). Wait, but because the targets can touch each other, a can be at the boundary of two targets. For example, if target A's interval is [2,5], and target B's interval is [5,8], then a=5 is in both intervals. So the shot's x coordinate a can be in multiple targets' intervals. But according to the problem statement, the targets are arranged such that they don't overlap but can touch. So in such a case, a shot's x can belong to two targets (if they are touching and a is exactly at the boundary).

So step 1: find all targets where a is within [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i]. Since the intervals are sorted and non-overlapping except at the endpoints, this can be done via binary search.

But how?

Let's think: the targets are sorted by their left x (x_i - r_i). For a given a, perform a binary search to find the first target where x_i - r_i <= a. Then, check if a <= x_i + r_i. If yes, then this target's interval contains a. Also, check adjacent targets in case a is at the boundary between two targets.

Wait, the targets are sorted by their left x coordinate. So for a given a, the possible targets whose intervals contain a are those where the left x is <= a, and the right x is >=a.

So we can perform a binary search to find the rightmost target where x_i - r_i <= a. Then, check if that target's x_i + r_i >=a. If yes, then it contains a. Then, also check the next target (if exists) since a may be at the right end of the current target and the next target's left x is equal to a (if the targets are touching).

Wait, but in the sorted list, the left x is in increasing order. So for example:

Target 1: [1, 3]

Target 2: [3, 5]

If a=3, then it's in both targets' intervals.

So for a binary search approach, when searching for a=3, the binary search may find target 1 (left x=1 <=3). Then, check if 3 <=3 (target 1's right x). Yes. So target 1 is a candidate. Then, also check target 2 (the next target) to see if a is in their interval.

So the approach would be:

- Binary search to find the leftmost target where left x <= a.

- Then, check that target and possibly the next one (if a is at the boundary).

Alternatively, after finding the possible target via binary search, check the target found and possibly the previous ones if the a is in their interval.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

But the key idea is that a can be in at most two targets' intervals (if the target's interval ends at a and the next starts at a). So for each shot, after performing the binary search, we have to check a couple of targets.

So step 1 for each shot (a, b) is to find the targets whose x interval includes a. This can be done in O(log n) time per shot.

Once we have those candidates (possibly 0, 1, or 2 targets), we then check if the shot hits them (by checking the distance squared plus b^2 <= r_i^2).

If any of these candidates is hit by the shot, then we need to update the target's first hit time.

Now, the number of candidates per shot is O(1), so the total time for all shots is O(m log n), which is acceptable for m=2e5 and n=1e4 (log2(1e4) is about 14, so 2e5 *14= 2.8e6 operations).

This seems manageable.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess the targets by sorting them based on their left x coordinate (x_i - r_i).

2. For each shot (a, b), compute s = b^2.

3. Find the candidate targets where a is in their x interval [x_i - r_i, x_i + r_i]. These are the targets where the shot's x is within the x interval of the target. Since the intervals are non-overlapping and sorted, this can be done via binary search.

4. For each candidate target, check if (a - x_i)^2 + s <= r_i^2. If yes, then the shot hits this target.

5. For each target hit, if it hasn't been hit before (its first hit index is -1), update it with the current shot's index (shot_num +1, since shots are 1-based).

6. At the end, count how many targets have a first hit index != -1 and output accordingly.

So the key steps are:

- Sorting the targets by x_i - r_i.

- For each shot, binary search to find possible targets.

Now, let's work out the details.

First, sorting the targets by x_i - r_i.

Each target has x_i and r_i. The left x is x_i - r_i. So after sorting, the list is ordered by left x.

For binary search, we can create a list of the left x's and right x's. But perhaps it's easier to store the targets in a list sorted by left x.

Then, for a given a, we can binary search to find the largest left x <= a.

So the binary search would find the index of the first target in the list where left x <= a. Then, we check if the right x of that target is >= a. If yes, then it's a candidate. Also, check the next target (if exists) to see if a is in their interval (like when a is at the boundary).

So for example, the binary search could return the index of the rightmost target with left x <= a. Then, check that target and the next one (if exists).

Alternatively, here's a possible approach for finding all targets that contain a in their x interval:

Use the bisect module in Python. The sorted list is the left x of each target. We can perform a bisect_right to find the insertion point of a. Then, the candidate targets are at index insertion_point-1 and insertion_point.

For example, sorted left x list is [1, 3, 5]. For a=3, bisect_right returns 2 (the insertion point after 3). So insertion_point-1 is 1 (second element) and insertion_point is 2 (third element). Check if a is in the target's interval. But in this case, the third element's left x is 5 which is >3, so only insertion_point-1 may be a candidate.

Wait, bisect_right returns the first index where the left x is greater than a. So insertion_point is the index where you would insert a in the sorted list to maintain order. So the possible candidate targets are at insertion_point-1 (if exists) and insertion_point (if exists).

For each candidate target, check if a is between left x and right x.

So for example:

sorted_left_x = [1, 3, 5, 7]

a=4: bisect_right returns 2 (since 3 <4 <5). So insertion_point is 2. Check target at 1 (left x 3) and 2 (left x5). Target 1's left x is 3, right x is 3+ r_i. Suppose target 1's right x is 5. Then a=4 is in [3,5], so it's a candidate. Target 2's left x is5 which is >4, so not a candidate.

So in code:

from bisect import bisect_right

sorted_targets = sorted targets by left x.

left_x_list = [t.left for t in sorted_targets]

insertion_point = bisect_right(left_x_list, a)

candidate_indices = []
if insertion_point >0:
    candidate_indices.append(insertion_point-1)
if insertion_point < len(sorted_targets):
    candidate_indices.append(insertion_point)

Then, for each index in candidate_indices, check if a <= sorted_targets[index].right_x.

If yes, then the target is a candidate.

Thus, for each shot, the number of candidates is up to 2.

Now, for each candidate target, we need to check if (a -x_i)^2 + b^2 <= r_i^2.

So for each candidate target:

x_i = sorted_targets[index].x

r_i = sorted_targets[index].r

if (a -x_i)^2 + b*b <= r_i*r_i:

then the shot hits this target.

If the shot hits any candidate target, then for each hit target, we check if it's first hit time is not set. If not, we set it to the current shot's index (since shots are processed in order, the first occurrence will be the earliest).

So steps:

Read n targets, sort them by left x.

Read m shots, process each in order.

For each shot:

   compute a, b.

   s = b*b.

   find candidates via bisect.

   for each candidate target:

       if r_i^2 < s: skip (since (a-x_i)^2 + s would be >= s > r_i^2)

       else:

           compute dx = a -x_i

           if dx*dx + s <= r_i*r_i:

               then check if target's first hit is unset. If yes, set it to current shot number (1-based).

Thus, the total time per shot is O(log n) for the bisect, plus O(1) checks.

This should be feasible.

Now, let's code this.

But wait, how to represent the targets?

We can store them as a list of tuples (left, right, x, r, index). But when sorting, we sort by left. We need to track the original indices as well, because the output requires the order of the input.

Wait, the output needs to be for each target in the order they were given in the input. So when we process the targets, we need to store their original indices.

Yes. So when reading the targets, we need to keep track of their original indices. When we sort them by left x, we need to keep their x, r, original index.

But after sorting, when checking candidates, the original indices are needed to update the correct first hit array.

So here's the plan:

- Read n targets, each with x_i and r_i. For each, compute left = x_i - r_i, right = x_i + r_i. Store as a list of tuples (left, right, x_i, r_i, original_index).

- Sort this list by left.

- Create a list of lefts for bisect: lefts = [t[0] for t in sorted_targets].

- Initialize an array first_hit of size n, filled with -1.

- For each shot (index j from 0 to m-1):

   read a, b.

   compute s = b*b.

   insertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(lefts, a)

   candidates = []

   if insertion_point > 0:

       candidates.append(insertion_point-1)

   if insertion_point < len(lefts):

       candidates.append(insertion_point)

   for idx in candidates:

       t = sorted_targets[idx]

       left_t, right_t, x_t, r_t, original_index = t

       if a > right_t:

           continue

       # Now, check if (a - x_t)^2 + s <= r_t^2

       if r_t * r_t < s:

           continue

       dx = a - x_t

       if dx * dx + s <= r_t * r_t:

           if first_hit[original_index] == -1:

               first_hit[original_index] = j+1  # since shots are 1-based

               # Once set, no need to check further shots for this target.

   (Wait, but once a target is hit by a shot, we need to record the first occurrence. So for the same target, the first shot that hits it is the earliest. So in the code, once first_hit is set, we don't need to process further hits.)

Thus, for each shot, even if a target is hit multiple times, the first occurrence will be stored.

Now, the code steps:

Read n.

Read n lines, each with x_i and r_i. Compute left and right. Keep track of original index (0-based or 1-based? The output requires targets to be numbered in the input order, starting from 1. So original index should be 0-based here, but in the input order. So when we read the first target, original index is 0 (but in the output, the first target is numbered 1). Wait, the problem statement says that targets are numbered starting from one. So when storing original index, it's 0-based (since we read them in order 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1) and when outputting, add 1. Wait, no. Let's see: the output requires that for each target in the input order (starting from 1), output their first hit. So, for the first target read (original index 0 in the code), the output is the first element in the result array. So the original index in the code is 0-based. Thus, first_hit is an array of size n, with indices 0-based, corresponding to the order of input. Then, when outputting, the elements are printed in the order 0,1,...,n-1, which is the same as the input order.

Thus, when creating the sorted list, for each target, we store the original index (0-based) so that when we hit a target in the sorted list, we can update the first_hit array at original_index.

So, code outline:

Read n.

sorted_targets = []

for i in range(n):

    x, r = map(int, input().split())

    left = x - r

    right = x + r

    sorted_targets.append( (left, right, x, r, i) )

sorted_targets.sort(key=lambda t: t[0])

lefts = [t[0] for t in sorted_targets]

Read m.

first_hit = [-1] * n

for shot_num in range(m):

    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    s = b * b

    a_point = a

    # Find insertion point.

    ip = bisect.bisect_right(lefts, a_point)

    candidates = []

    if ip >0:

        candidates.append(ip-1)

    if ip < len(sorted_targets):

        candidates.append(ip)

    for ci in candidates:

        t = sorted_targets[ci]

        left_t, right_t, x_t, r_t, original_index = t

        # Check if a is within [left_t, right_t]

        if a_point < left_t or a_point > right_t:

            continue

        # Check if r_t^2 >= s

        r_squared = r_t * r_t

        if r_squared < s:

            continue

        dx = a_point - x_t

        dx_squared = dx * dx

        if dx_squared + s <= r_squared:

            if first_hit[original_index] == -1:

                first_hit[original_index] = shot_num + 1  # since shots are 1-based

                # Break early for this target? Not necessary, but once set, further hits don't affect.

                # However, since the candidate list is up to two targets, and for each shot, we process all candidates, but first hit is stored, it's okay.

So this code would work.

Now, test against sample input 1.

Sample input 1:

3

2 1 → x=2, r=1 → left=1, right=3. [left=2-1=1, right=2+1=3]

5 2 → x=5, r=2 → left=3, right=7.

10 1 → x=10, r=1 → left=9, right=11.

So sorted_targets sorted by left would be [(1,3,2,1,0), (3,7,5,2,1), (9,11,10,1,2)]

lefts = [1,3,9]

Shots:

5

0 1 → a=0, b=1. s=1.

Check insertion_point for a=0. bisect_right on lefts [1,3,9] for 0. Since 0 <1, bisect_right returns 0. So ip=0. candidates are ip-1 = -1 (no), and ip=0 (yes).

So candidates is [0]. Check target 0: left=1, right=3. a=0 is not in [1,3]. So no.

So no hit.

Shot 2: (1,3) → a=1, b=3. s=9.

Check for each candidate.

a=1. bisect_right(lefts, 1) → lefts are [1,3,9]. bisect_right returns 1 (since 1 is at index 0, but bisect_right returns insertion after equal elements. Wait, the lefts are [1,3,9]. For a=1, the elements <=1 are the first element (1). So bisect_right returns 1. So ip=1. candidates are 0 and 1.

Check candidate 0 (left 1, right 3). a=1 is within [1,3]. r_t=1. r_squared=1. s=9. 1 <9 → skip.

Check candidate 1: left 3. a=1 <3 → no.

So no hit.

Shot3:3,0 → a=3, b=0. s=0.

ip = bisect_right(lefts, 3) → lefts are [1,3,9]. bisect_right for 3: the elements are 1,3,9. The insertion point after 3 is 2. So ip=2. Candidates are 1 and 2.

Check candidate 1: left 3, right 7. a=3 is in [3,7]. x_t=5, r_t=2. s=0. r_squared=4 >=0. dx=3-5= -2. dx^2=4. 4+0 =4 <=4 → yes. So first_hit[original_index=1] is set to 3.

Check candidate 2: left 9. a=3 <9 → no.

So this shot hits target 1 (original index 1, which is the second target in input).

Shot4:4,0. s=0. a=4.

bisect_right(lefts,4) → lefts [1,3,9]. 4 is between 3 and 9. So bisect_right returns 2. candidates are 1 and 2.

Candidate 1: left=3, right=7. a=4 is in [3,7]. x_t=5, r=2. dx=4-5=-1. dx^2=1. 1 +0 <=4 → yes. So target 1 is hit again, but first hit is already 3, so no change.

Candidate 2: 9>4 → no.

So no new hits.

Shot5:4,0 again. same as shot4. No new hits.

So first_hit is [ -1, 3, -1 ] for the original indices 0,1,2. But in the input, the third target (original index 2) has no hits.

But according to the sample output, the answer is 2 targets hit. The first hit array is 3,3,-1.

Wait, sample input output:

3

2 1

5 2

10 1

5 shots. Output is 2 targets hit, and for each target:3 3 -1.

Wait, the third target is not hit. The first two are hit. How?

Ah, in the third shot (3,0), the shot hits target 2 (the second target). But according to the code, the second target in the input is 5 2 (original index 1). So first_hit[1] is set to 3.

Then, in the fourth and fifth shots (4,0), the shot is at a=4, which is in the second target's interval (3 to7). So for each of these shots, the code checks candidate 1 (the second target). The distance squared is (4-5)^2 +0=1 <=4. So the fourth shot hits it. But since first_hit[1] is already 3, it remains 3.

So first_hit array is:

target 0 (original index 0, first target in input) is not hit.

target 1 (original index 1, second in input) is hit in shot 3.

target 2 (original index 2, third in input) is not hit.

But sample output is 2, and the first hit array is 3 3 -1.

Wait, sample output shows:

2

3 3 -1

Which implies that the first and second targets are hit. But according to the code, only the second target is hit. So there's a mistake here.

Wait, sample input's third shot is (3,0). For the second target (x=5, r=2):

distance squared is (3-5)^2 +0^2 =4 <=4. So it hits. So first_hit[1] is 3.

The first target (x=2, r=1) has interval [1,3]. a=3 is within this interval. So when shot (3,0) is processed, a=3. What happens?

For this shot, the code will find the candidates:

bisect_right(lefts,3) → lefts are [1,3,9]. The elements are 1,3,9. For a=3, bisect_right returns 2 (since 3 is at index 1, and bisect_right returns insertion point after). So ip=2. candidates are 1 and 2.

Check candidate 1: left=3, right=7. a=3 is in [3,7]. So check this target (the second in input). It is hit.

Check candidate 2: left=9. a=3 <9 → no.

But also, the first target's interval is [1,3]. a=3 is at the end. So during the bisect, insertion_point is 2. But candidate 1 is the target with left=3. But the first target has left=1. So why wasn't the first target considered?

Ah, here's the problem. The first target's left is 1, right is 3. The second target's left is3. So the first target's interval is [1,3], and the second's is [3,7].

When a=3, the bisect_right(lefts, 3) is done. lefts are [1,3,9]. The insertion point for 3 would be 2, because bisect_right returns the insertion point after the existing elements equal to the key. So in the list [1,3,9], a=3 is found at index 1, and bisect_right returns 2. So the candidates are ip-1=1 and ip=2.

Candidate 1 is the second target (left=3). Check if a=3 is within [3,7] → yes.

Candidate 2 is the third target (left=9) → a=3 <9 → no.

But the first target's left is 1, which is <=3. Why wasn't it considered?

Ah, because the code adds candidates insertion_point-1 and insertion_point. insertion_point is 2. So insertion_point-1 is 1. The target at index 1 in the sorted list is the second target (left=3). The first target is at index 0 in the sorted list. So it's not included.

So the code misses the first target here.

Wait, this is a problem. Because a=3 is the right endpoint of the first target's interval. So it should be included in the first target's interval.

But according to the bisect_right approach, for a=3, insertion_point is 2. So candidates are indices 1 and 2.

But the first target's left is 1 <=3, but it's at index 0. So the code's approach of checking insertion_point-1 and insertion_point is not sufficient.

Ah, here's the mistake. The bisect_right returns the insertion point where a would be inserted. So all elements before the insertion point are <= a.

So in this case, the first target (left=1) is at index 0. The second target (left=3) is at index 1. The third target's left is 9.

For a=3, the bisect_right returns 2. So elements before 2 (indices 0 and 1) are <=3. So the first two targets have left <=3.

But according to the code's candidate selection, only insertion_point-1 (1) and insertion_point (2) are considered. But the first target (index 0) is left=1 <=3. But insertion_point is 2. So insertion_point-1 is 1, which is the second target. The first target is not considered.

Thus, the code misses the first target in this case.

This is a critical error.

So the problem is that the bisect_right approach is not finding all targets with left <= a. It only considers the insertion_point-1 and insertion_point, but in cases where there are multiple targets with left <= a, this approach misses them.

For example, in the sample input, the first target's left is 1 <=3. The second target's left is 3 <=3. Both are <= a=3. But insertion_point is 2, so candidates are 1 and 2. The first target is index 0, which is not in the candidates.

So the code is incorrect.

Hmm. So the approach of finding candidates by checking insertion_point-1 and insertion_point is incorrect. Because there may be multiple targets with left <=a, but their right is >=a.

So how to correctly find all targets whose intervals contain a.

The correct approach would be:

Find all targets where left <=a and right >=a.

The intervals are sorted in order of increasing left.

But since the intervals are non-overlapping, and sorted by left, any target that contains a must be the first target with left <=a and right >=a. Or the first one and possibly the next if a is at the boundary.

But in the case of the sample input, a=3 is in the first target's interval (right is3) and the second's left is3. So the first target's interval is [1,3], and the second's is [3,7]. So a=3 is included in both. But according to the problem statement, the targets are allowed to touch but not overlap. So the first target's right is 3, the second's left is 3, so a=3 is in both.

So for a=3, the code needs to check both targets.

But how?

The current code's approach using bisect_right and checking insertion_point-1 and insertion_point fails in this case.

So what's the correct way to find all targets that have left <=a and right >=a?

The intervals are sorted by left. So the lefts are in non-decreasing order. The rights are also in non-decreasing order, because the intervals are non-overlapping. Because if a target has left = l1 and right = r1, and the next target has left = l2 >= l1, then l2 >= r1 (since they can't overlap). So the intervals are sorted by left, and each subsequent interval's left >= previous interval's right.

Thus, for any a, there can be at most two targets that contain a: one where a is at the end of one interval and the start of another.

But how to find them?

The correct approach is to find the largest left <=a. Then, check if this target's right >=a. If yes, it's a candidate. Also, check the next target (if exists) if its left ==a (since the previous target's right may be a, and the next target's left is a).

But how to find the largest left <=a.

This can be found using bisect_right, which gives the insertion point. The index of the largest left <=a is insertion_point -1.

Then, check that target. Also, check the next target (if exists) if its left is <=a.

Wait, but since intervals are non-overlapping and sorted by left, the next target's left is >= the current target's right. So if the current target's right is >=a, then the next target's left >= current target's right >=a. So the next target's left is >=a, so a is not in its interval.

Except when current target's right ==a, and next target's left ==a (touching). So a is in both intervals.

So in this case, after finding the target at insertion_point-1, we need to check if its right ==a and if the next target's left ==a. If so, check the next target.

Thus, the correct steps are:

1. Find the insertion point using bisect_right. The index of the largest left <=a is insertion_point-1.

2. If insertion_point-1 >=0:

   check if the target at insertion_point-1 has right >=a. If yes, it's a candidate.

3. Then, check if the next target (insertion_point-1 +1) has left ==a. If so, and a <= next target's right, then it's also a candidate.

So for the sample case with a=3:

bisect_right gives insertion_point=2. insertion_point-1=1. Target at 1 is left=3, right=7. a=3 is in [3,7]. So candidate.

Then check if next target (index 2) has left ==3? No, next target's left is9. So no.

But the first target (index 0) has left=1 <=3. Why isn't it considered?

Because insertion_point-1 is 1. So the code only checks the target at index 1.

Ah, this is the mistake. Because the target with left=1 is at index 0. bisect_right returns insertion_point=2 for a=3. So insertion_point-1=1. So the code is checking target 1, but target 0 has left=1 <=3 and right=3 >=3.

So the current approach fails to find this.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

So the problem lies in how the candidates are selected. The code assumes that a can be in at most one or two targets, but in reality, when a is at the right end of a previous target and the left end of the next target, the previous targets (those with left <=a and right >=a) may be missed.

So how can we correct this?

Alternative approach: For a given a, the correct candidate is the target where left <=a and right >=a. Because the intervals are non-overlapping and ordered, there can be at most two such targets: the one that ends at a and the one that starts at a.

But how to find them.

The correct way is to find the largest left <=a. If that target's right >=a, then it's a candidate. Then, check if there's a next target with left ==a and right >=a.

So steps:

1. Use bisect_right to find insertion_point.

2. The candidate is insertion_point-1.

3. If candidate >=0 and target's right >=a → add to candidates.

4. Check if the next target (insertion_point) has left ==a. If yes and right >=a → add to candidates.

But this misses targets where a is in a previous target.

Like in the sample case, the first target has left=1 <=3 and right=3 >=3. But insertion_point is 2 (bisect_right for a=3 returns 2), so insertion_point-1 is 1. Target 1's left is3 <=3 and right is7 >=3. So it's a candidate. But the first target (index 0) has left=1 <=3 and right=3 >=3. How to find it.

Thus, the current approach is incorrect.

The core problem is that the sorted list of lefts may have multiple entries <=a, but the code only checks the last one (insertion_point-1).

So how can we find all targets with left <=a and right >=a?

But since the intervals are non-overlapping and ordered, if a target's left <=a and right >=a, then all other such targets must be this one and/or the next one (if left is a and right >=a).

But how can that be?

Because the intervals are non-overlapping and sorted in order of left. So if a target's left <=a and right >=a, then any other target's interval would have to overlap with this target's interval, which is not allowed.

So there can be at most one target that contains a. But if a is at the boundary between two touching targets, then there can be two targets.

Wait, for example:

Target 1: [1,3]

Target 2: [3,5]

a=3 is in both. So two targets.

Thus, in this case, a=3 would be in two targets. So the code needs to find both.

But according to the current approach, after bisect_right on lefts [1,3], for a=3, insertion_point is 2. insertion_point-1 is 1. The target at index 1 has left=3 and right=5. a=3 is within its interval. So candidate is added. Then check the next target (insertion_point=2, which is out of bounds). So code checks only target 1. But target 0 has left=1 <=3 and right=3 >=3. So the code misses it.

Thus, the current approach is incorrect.

So what's the correct way to find all targets that contain a?

Perhaps, in addition to finding the insertion_point, we need to check all targets with left <=a, but also whose right >=a. But how to do this efficiently.

Since the targets are sorted by left, and their rights are also in order (non-decreasing? No, not necessarily. For example, two targets: [1, 5] and [6, 7]. Their rights are 5 and7, which are in order. But another example: [1, 10], [11, 15], then [12, 13]. The rights are 10,15,13. So rights are not sorted. Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, the targets are non-overlapping and non-nested, so their intervals are sorted by left, and each next left is >= previous right.

So for example, the first target's interval is [l1, r1], the next's is [l2, r2], where l2 >= r1. So the rights are non-decreasing. Because each r1 <= l2, and r2 >= l2 (since it's a target's right). So r1 <= l2 <= r2. So r1 <= r2. So the rights are non-decreasing.

Thus, the list of rights is non-decreasing.

So for the targets sorted by left, the rights are non-decreasing.

Thus, the intervals are ordered by left, and each next interval's left >= previous right. So the list of lefts and rights are both non-decreasing.

Thus, if a target at index i has left <=a, then all targets at index <i also have left <=a. But since the rights are non-decreasing, the target i's right is >= any previous target's right.

But how does this help?

When a is in a target's interval, then the target must be the last one with left <=a, and its right >=a. Or if a is at the boundary of two targets.

So to find the candidate targets, the correct approach is:

- Find the largest index i where left_i <=a.

- If i exists and right_i >=a → add to candidates.

- Check if i+1 exists and left_i+1 ==a and right_i+1 >=a → add to candidates.

But how to find the largest i where left_i <=a.

This can be done with bisect_right. The largest i where left_i <=a is insertion_point-1.

So for a=3 in the sample input:

bisect_right returns 2. insertion_point-1 is 1. The target at 1 has left=3, right=7. a=3 is in [3,7]. So it's a candidate.

Then check target 1+1=2. left=9 !=3 → no.

But the target at index 0 has left=1 <=3, and right=3 >=3. So why isn't it considered?

Because insertion_point-1 is 1, which is the largest i with left_i <=a=3. But in this case, target 0's left=1 <=3, but insertion_point-1 is 1, which is the second target's left=3. Because the targets are sorted by left, and the first target has left=1, the second left=3, third left=9. So for a=3, the largest i where left_i <=3 is 1.

Thus, the code's approach of checking insertion_point-1 is correct for finding the largest i with left_i <=a.

But the first target's left=1 <=3. So why is the code not considering it?

Ah, because the code is assuming that the targets are non-overlapping, so the largest i with left_i <=a is the only candidate. But in this case, the first target's left is <=a, but it's right is >=a. So why is the code not considering it?

Because the code is assuming that the intervals are non-overlapping and ordered. So if the target at insertion_point-1 has left_i <=a, and right_i >=a, then no previous targets can have left_j <=a and right_j >=a, because their right_j <= left_i (since the intervals are non-overlapping and sorted).

Wait, no. If the first target's right is 3, and the second's left is3, then the first target's right is3, which is equal to the second's left. So the first target's interval is [1,3], and the second's is [3,7]. For a=3, it's in both.

So the code's current approach only finds the second target (i=1), but not the first (i=0). How can this be fixed?

The code's approach is incorrect because, in this scenario, a is in the first target's interval as well. But how to find that.

Because the code's current approach only checks the largest i with left_i <=a. But in this case, the first target's left_i=1 <=3, and the largest i is 1 (second target). So the code is not checking earlier targets.

But according to the problem's conditions, the intervals are non-overlapping. So if a target's left_i <=a, and its right_i >=a, then any previous target must have right_j <= left_i. So their right_j < left_i. Hence, previous targets can't have right_j >=a, because a >= left_i (since left_i is the largest left_i <=a) and left_i >= right_j (due to the non-overlapping).

Thus, in the sample case, the code is correct. But according to the sample input, the first target's interval is [1,3], so a=3 is in this interval. So the code's approach is not considering it, leading to incorrect results.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's conditions. Or perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, the sample input's first target has x=2, r=1. So left is 2-1=1, right is 3. So the interval is [1,3]. The second target has x=5, r=2: left=3, right=7. The third target has x=10, r=1: left=9, right=11.

The third shot is (3,0). a=3. So the shot's x is 3. So it is in the first target's interval (3 is in [1,3]), and also in the second target's interval (3 is in [3,7]).

So according to the problem statement, both targets are hit by this shot.

But according to the code's current approach, the code will check the second target (since insertion_point-1=1), and find that it's a hit. The first target is not checked.

So the code is missing the first target.

This is the crux of the problem. So how can the code check both targets?

The code's current approach is incorrect because when a is in the right end of a previous target and the left end of the next target, the previous target is not checked.

The core issue is that the code's approach of checking insertion_point-1 and insertion_point is not sufficient to find all candidates.

So what's the solution?

The correct approach is to find all targets where left_i <=a and right_i >=a. Due to the non-overlapping nature of the intervals, there can be at most two such targets: one ending at a, and another starting at a.

But how to find the previous target?

Alternatively, find the target with the maximum left_i <=a, and check if it contains a. If not, then no. But in the sample case, the target with maximum left_i <=a is the second target (left=3), which contains a=3. So the code checks it. But the first target also contains a=3. How can this happen?

This can happen if the previous target's right is equal to the current target's left, and a is exactly at this point.

So in this case, the previous target's left_i <=a (since left_i=1 <=3), and right_i=3 >=3. So it contains a. But the code is not finding it.

Thus, the code's approach is missing this case.

The problem is that the code is only checking the largest i with left_i <=a, but there could be a previous target whose left_i <=a and right_i >=a.

But according to the problem's conditions, this is impossible. Because the intervals are non-overlapping and sorted. If the previous target's right_i >=a, then since the current target's left_i >= previous target's right_i, current target's left_i >=a. So if the previous target's right_i >=a, then the current target's left_i >=a, and a would not be in the current target's interval.

But in the sample case, the previous target's right_i=3, and the current target's left_i=3. So the previous target's right_i=3 >=a=3, and the current target's left_i=3 <=a=3. So the current target's interval includes a=3.

So this is a case where two targets touch at a point a=3, and both include a.

Thus, the code's approach of checking only the largest i with left_i <=a and the next target is not sufficient.

So how to find all targets that contain a?

The correct way is to find the largest i with left_i <=a. If that target's right_i >=a, then it's a candidate. Also, check if there's a previous target (i-1) whose right_i ==a, and left_i <=a. Because such a target would also include a.

But how to find that?

Alternatively, after finding the largest i with left_i <=a (insertion_point-1), check target i and also target i-1 if i>0 and target i-1's right >=a.

But this would require backtracking.

But this would lead to O(1) time per shot, since at most two checks.

So steps:

1. Find insertion_point using bisect_right.

2. i = insertion_point-1.

3. If i >=0:

   if sorted_targets[i].right >=a:

       add to candidates.

4. Check if i>0:

   if sorted_targets[i-1].right >=a and sorted_targets[i-1].left <=a:

       add to candidates.

But wait, since the intervals are non-overlapping and sorted, sorted_targets[i-1].right <= sorted_targets[i].left.

But if sorted_targets[i-1].right >=a, then sorted_targets[i-1].right >=a and sorted_targets[i].left <=a. But sorted_targets[i].left >= sorted_targets[i-1].right. So this implies that a >= sorted_targets[i-1].right and a >= sorted_targets[i].left. Which is only possible if sorted_targets[i-1].right == sorted_targets[i].left and a is equal to this value.

Thus, in this case, the two targets touch at a, and a is in both.

So in code, after finding i = insertion_point-1, which is the largest target with left_i <=a, check if i >=0. If yes, check if target i's right >=a. Also, check if i-1 >=0, and target i-1's right ==a, and target i-1's left <=a.

Thus, code:

candidates = []

i = insertion_point -1

if i >=0:

    t_i = sorted_targets[i]

    if t_i.right >=a:

        candidates.append(i)

    # check i-1

    if i-1 >=0:

        t_iminus1 = sorted_targets[i-1]

        if t_iminus1.right ==a and t_iminus1.left <=a:

            candidates.append(i-1)

Thus, for the sample case a=3, i=1. Check target 1. Its right is7 >=3 → added to candidates. Then check i-1=0. Target 0's right is3 ==3, and left=1 <=3 → added to candidates. Thus, candidates are 1 and 0.

Then, for each candidate, check if the shot hits.

In the sample case, for shot (3,0):

candidates are 0 and 1.

Check target 0: x=2, r=1. a=3. s=0.

r^2 =1 >=0.

dx=3-2=1. dx^2=1. 1+0=1 <=1 → yes. So target 0 is hit.

Check target 1: x=5, r=2. dx=3-5=-2. dx^2=4. 4+0=4 <=4 → yes.

So both targets are hit. The first_hit array for original indices 0 and 1 are set to 3.

Thus, the code would correctly process the sample input.

So the code needs to be modified to include the previous target (i-1) if its right ==a and left <=a.

Thus, the correct candidate selection steps are:

After finding i = insertion_point-1:

   add i to candidates if t_i.right >=a.

   check if i-1 >=0 and t_iminus1.right ==a and t_iminus1.left <=a:

       add i-1 to candidates.

Thus, the code will check up to two candidates: i and i-1.

So in code:

import bisect

...

ip = bisect.bisect_right(lefts, a)

i = ip -1

candidates = []

# Check the target at i.

if i >=0:

    t = sorted_targets[i]

    if t[1] >= a:

        candidates.append(i)

# Check the previous target (i-1) if its right is a and left <=a.

if i >=1:

    t_prev = sorted_targets[i-1]

    if t_prev[1] == a and t_prev[0] <=a:

        candidates.append(i-1)

# Also, check if the next target (ip) has left ==a.

if ip < len(sorted_targets):

    t_next = sorted_targets[ip]

    if t_next[0] ==a and t_next[1] >=a:

        candidates.append(ip)

Thus, for the sample case a=3:

ip =2.

i=1.

candidates.append(1) since t_i.right=7 >=3.

Check i-1=0: t_prev.right=3 ==3 and left=1 <=3 → add 0.

Check ip=2: t_next.left=9 !=3 → no.

Thus, candidates are 0 and 1.

Now, when processing these candidates, the code will check both targets.

So the code now correctly finds all candidates.

Thus, the code needs to be modified to include this logic.

Let me update the code accordingly.

Now, the candidate selection is:

For a given a:

   ip = bisect.bisect_right(lefts, a)

   i = ip -1

   candidates = []

   if i >=0:

       t = sorted_targets[i]

       if t[1] >=a:

           candidates.append(i)

   # Check previous target if exists and right ==a and left <=a.

   if i >=1:

       t_prev = sorted_targets[i-1]

       if t_prev[1] ==a and t_prev[0] <=a:

           candidates.append(i-1)

   # Check next target if exists and left ==a and right >=a.

   if ip < len(sorted_targets):

       t_next = sorted_targets[ip]

       if t_next[0] ==a and t_next[1] >=a:

           candidates.append(ip)

Thus, for each shot, candidates can be up to 3: i, i-1, and ip.

But in reality, due to the intervals being non-overlapping, the code will find 0, 1, or 2 candidates.

But this logic ensures that all possible candidates are checked.

Thus, this code should now handle the sample case correctly.

Let's re-simulate the sample input.

Sample input 1:

Shots:

Third shot (3,0):

a=3.

ip = bisect_right(lefts [1,3,9],3) → returns 2.

i=1.

Check if t_i's right (7) >=3 → yes. Add 1 to candidates.

Check i-1=0: t_prev.right=3 ==3 and left=1 <=3 → add 0.

Check ip=2: t_next.left=9 !=3 → no.

Thus, candidates are 0 and 1.

For candidate 0:

x=2, r=1. s=0.

r^2=1 >=0.

dx=3-2=1. dx^2=1. 1+0=1 <=1 → hit.

For candidate 1:

x=5, r=2. dx=3-5= -2. dx^2=4. 4+0=4 <=4 → hit.

Thus, both targets are hit. So first_hit for original indices 0 and 1 are set to 3.

Thus, the code now gives the correct output.

This would explain the sample output's first two targets being hit.

Thus, the code needs to be modified to include this candidate selection logic.

This is a crucial correction. With this, the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, the final code.

Now, let's write the Python code with these corrections.

Read the targets, sort them by left.

For each shot:

   a, b = input.

   s = b*b.

   compute a_point = a.

   ip = bisect.bisect_right(lefts, a_point).

   i = ip-1.

   candidates = []

   if i >=0:

       t_i = sorted_targets[i]

       if t_i[1] >= a_point:

           candidates.append(i)

   if i >=1:

       t_prev = sorted_targets[i-1]

       if t_prev[1] == a_point and t_prev[0] <= a_point:

           candidates.append(i-1)

   if ip < len(sorted_targets):

       t_next = sorted_targets[ip]

       if t_next[0] == a_point and t_next[1] >= a_point:

           candidates.append(ip)

   for ci in candidates:

       t = sorted_targets[ci]

       left_t, right_t, x_t, r_t, original_index = t

       if r_t * r_t < s:

           continue

       dx = a_point - x_t

       dx_squared = dx * dx

       if dx_squared + s <= r_t * r_t:

           if first_hit[original_index] == -1:

               first_hit[original_index] = shot_num +1

Thus, the code now correctly handles all cases.

Sample input 2:

3

3 2 → left 1, right 5.

7 1 → left 6, right 8.

11 2 → left 9, right 13.

Shots:

4 shots.

First shot (2,1):

a=2, b=1. s=1.

ip = bisect_right(lefts [1,6,9],2) → returns 1. i=0.

Check target 0's right=5 >=2 → add 0.

Check i-1=-1 → no.

Check ip=1 → target 1's left=6 !=2 → no.

Thus, candidate is 0.

r_t=2. r_squared=4 >=1.

dx=2-3= -1. dx_squared=1. 1+1=2 <=4 → yes.

Thus, first_hit[0] =1.

Second shot (6,0):

a=6, s=0.

bisect_right(lefts [1,6,9],6 → returns 2. i=1.

Check target 1's right=8 >=6 → add 1.

Check i-1=0: target 0's right=5 ==6? No.

Check ip=2 → target 2's left=9 !=6 → no.

Thus, candidate is 1.

r=1, s=0.

dx=6-7= -1. dx_squared=1. 1 +0=1 <=1 → yes. So first_hit[1] =2.

Third shot (6,4):

s=16.

r_t for target 1 is 1. r_squared=1 <16 → skip.

No other candidates.

Fourth shot (11,2):

s=4.

bisect_right(lefts [1,6,9],11 → returns 3. i=2.

Check target 2's right=13 >=11 → yes. Add 2.

Check i-1=1: target 1's right=8 !=11 → no.

Check ip=3 (out of bounds).

Thus, candidate is 2.

r_t=2. r_squared=4 >=4.

dx=11-11=0. 0 +4=4 <=4 → yes. first_hit[2] =4.

Thus, first_hit is [1,2,4], which matches the sample output.

Thus, the code now works correctly.
