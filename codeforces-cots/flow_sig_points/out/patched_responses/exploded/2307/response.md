Okay, let's see. We need to find all positions q such that when we take the elements a_q, a_{q+p}, a_{q+2p}, ..., up to m elements (since we need m elements to match the length of b), then after rearranging them, they equal the sequence b. So the key is that the multiset of those selected elements from a must exactly match the multiset of elements in b.

Hmm. So the approach here is to check for each possible q whether the elements in a at positions q, q+p, q+ (m-1)p (as long as q + (m-1)*p <=n) form a multiset that matches the multiset of b.

But the problem is how to do this efficiently given the constraints. Since n and m can be up to 2e5, a brute force approach where we check each q by collecting the elements and comparing the frequency would be O(n*m) in the worst case, which is way too slow.

So we need a more efficient way. Let's think about the possible q values. For p being large, like 2e5, the number of possible q's could be small. But in the worst case, when p is 1, and m is 1, then there are O(n) q's to check. So we need an approach that can process each q in O(1) or O(m) but with the total number of q's multiplied by that being manageable.

Wait, but how many q's are there? For each q, it must satisfy q + (m-1)*p <=n. So q can range from 1 to n - (m-1)*p. Wait, but if (m-1)*p is larger than n-1, then there are no possible q's. So first, we can check if (m-1)*p >=n. Then answer is zero. So the first step is to compute the maximum possible q. The maximum q is n - (m-1)*p. But since q must be at least 1, the valid q's are in 1 <= q <= max_q, where max_q = n - (m-1)*p. If this is negative, then no solution.

So first, check if m*p > n - q + ... no, wait. Let's compute: For the last element in the sequence, it's q + (m-1)*p. So that must be <=n. So q <=n - (m-1)*p. So the maximum q is n - (m-1)*p. But if (m-1)*p >=n, then n - (m-1)*p <=0, so no possible q's. So in that case, output zero. So the first step is to handle that case.

Once we have possible q's, for each q, we need to collect the elements a[q-1], a[q+p-1], a[q+2p-1], ... (since Python uses zero-based indexing, but the problem statement uses 1-based). Wait, the input is given as a1, a2, ..., an, so in the code, the list would be zero-based. So for a given q (starting from 1), the elements are a[q-1], a[q-1 + p], a[q-1 + 2p], etc., up to m elements. Wait, yes. So for example, q=1: the positions are 0, 0+p, 0+2p, etc. But wait, the first element is a_q. So q is 1-based. So in code, the indices would be (q-1) + k*p for k from 0 to m-1. So for each q, the indices are (q-1) + k*p for k in 0..m-1.

So each q must be such that (q-1) + (m-1)*p <n. Because (q-1) is the starting index (zero-based). So the maximum q-1 is (n-1) - (m-1)*p. So the maximum q is (n - (m-1)*p) as before. If that's less than 1, then no solution.

So the first thing is to check if m > (n - (q-1)) / p +1. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute the possible q's. Let's compute the maximum possible q:

q can be from 1 to (n - (m-1)*p). So if (n - (m-1)*p) <1, then no q's. So in code:

max_q = n - (m-1)*p

if max_q <1, then output 0.

Else, the q's are 1, 2, ..., max_q. But also, for each q, the step p must be such that all the indices are within the array. So even for q <= max_q, but when adding (m-1)*p steps, it's possible that the index is beyond the array? Wait, no. Because max_q is n - (m-1)*p, so q can be at most that. Then (q-1) + (m-1)*p = (n - (m-1)p -1) + (m-1)p = n-1. So the last element is exactly a[n-1], which is valid. So all the indices are valid.

So the total number of q's is max_q, but only if max_q >=1. Otherwise zero.

But the problem is how to check for each q if the multiset of elements in a (taken at positions q-1, q-1+p, etc.) matches the multiset of b.

The key is to compare the frequency of elements in the sample from a and in b.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Idea: For each possible q, collect the elements and compare their frequency with that of b. But this is O(m) per q, which is O(2e5 * 2e5) in worst case, which is 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: for each possible q, the elements are the elements of a in the positions congruent to (q-1) mod p. Because the step is p. So for example, if p=2, then for q=1, the positions are 0, 2, 4, etc. For q=2, positions are 1,3,5, etc. So each q corresponds to a residue modulo p. So for a given residue r (0 <= r <p), all q's that are (r+1) would belong to that residue. Because q is 1-based. So q-1 is r mod p. So for residue r, the q's are 1-based, so q-1 is r. So q = r+1. So the residues are 0,1,..p-1, and for each residue, the possible q's are r+1, r+1 + p, r+1 + 2p, etc., up to the maximum q.

Wait, no. For example, if p=2, then residues 0 and 1. For residue 0, possible q's are 1, 3,5, etc. Because q must start at r+1 (r=0 gives q=1), then adding multiples of p. Wait, no. Because for residue r, the q-1 must equal r mod p. So q-1 â‰¡ r mod p. So q can be any 1 + r mod p, but q must be in the valid range. So for each residue r, the q's are r+1, r+1 + p, r+1 +2p, etc., up to the maximum q.

But the maximum q is n - (m-1)*p. So for each residue r, the possible q's in that residue are all numbers of the form r+1 + k*p, where k is >=0, and r+1 +k*p <= max_q.

So for each residue r, we can precompute all possible q's in that residue and process them. But how does this help us?

Because for each residue r, the elements that need to be checked are the elements in a at positions r, r+p, r+2p, etc. So for each residue r, the elements are a[r], a[r+p], a[r+2p], ... etc. So the elements are grouped by their residue modulo p.

If we can pre-process for each residue r the frequency of elements in the windows of size m (since each q in this residue's group requires a window of m elements from the elements in residue r's list), then we can compare each window's frequency with that of b.

Ah, this is the key. Because for each residue r, the elements are in a list (sorted by their occurrence in a), and each q in residue r's group corresponds to a window of m consecutive elements in that list. Then, the multiset of that window must match the multiset of b.

But to compute this efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach for each residue's list.

But first, the steps would be:

1. Check if m is 0. Well, the problem says m is >=1. So no. So proceed.

2. Compute the required frequency map for b.

3. For each residue r (0 <= r <p), collect the elements in a that are at positions congruent to r modulo p. Let's call this list elements_r. So elements_r is a list of a[r], a[r+p], a[r+2p], etc.

4. For each elements_r list, the length must be >=m. Otherwise, no possible q's in this residue.

5. For each elements_r list with length >=m, we need to find all starting indices i in elements_r such that the window [i, i+m-1] in elements_r corresponds to a valid q. Then, check if the multiset of this window matches the multiset of b.

But how does the starting index i in elements_r relate to q?

Let's think. For residue r, the elements_r list is a[r], a[r+p], a[r+2p], etc. Each element in elements_r is at position r + k*p in a, where k is 0,1,2, etc.

So for elements_r[i], the position in a is r + i*p.

But the q is the starting position (1-based) of the first element in the window. The first element's position is r + i*p (since elements_r[i] is a[r + i*p]). So q is (r + i*p) + 1? Wait, no. Because a is 0-based. So the position in a is r + i*p. Then, in the problem statement, q is 1-based. So for the first element in the window, its position is (r + i*p) +1? Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, q is the starting position in a (1-based). So for example, if in a, the first element is a_1 (1-based), which is index 0 in Python. So if the first element in the window is at index 0, then q is 1.

So for elements_r[i], the position in a is r + i*p. Then, the q is (r + i*p) +1. Because a is 0-based. So the 1-based q is (r + i*p +1) ?

Wait, yes. For example, elements_r[0] is a[r], which is the 0-based index. The 1-based position is r+1. So q is r+1 for the first element. Then, the next element would be a[r + p], which is 1-based (r+p+1), but the q would be r+1 +p*0 (since in the problem statement, the elements are q, q+p, etc. So the first element is q, which is the 1-based position. So for a given window in elements_r starting at index i, the q is (r + i*p) +1.

But the q must also satisfy that the last element in the window is at position q + (m-1)*p <=n. Which translates to (r + i*p +1) + (m-1)*p <=n.

Wait, the last element's position is q + (m-1)*p. Which is (r + i*p +1) + (m-1)*p = r +1 + i*p + (m-1)*p = r+1 + p*(i + m -1).

This must be <=n. So:

r+1 + p*(i + m -1) <=n

=> p*(i + m -1) <=n - (r+1)

But since elements_r[i + m-1] must exist. So for elements_r, the window [i, i+m-1] must be within the list. So elements_r must have length >=m. Then, the maximum i for elements_r is len(elements_r) - m.

So for each elements_r of length l >=m, the possible i ranges from 0 to l -m.

So for each such i, we can compute q as (r + i*p +1). But wait, the elements in elements_r are a[r], a[r+p], a[r+2p], etc. So elements_r[i] is a[r + i*p]. So the first element in the window is elements_r[i] at position r + i*p (0-based), which is 1-based (r + i*p +1). So q is (r + i*p +1). But that's for the first element. So the q is (elements_r's first element's 1-based position) when i is 0.

So for a window starting at index i in elements_r, q is (r + i*p +1). But we need to check if the entire window (m elements) is valid. Which depends on whether (r + (i + m -1)*p) <=n-1. Since elements_r[i +m-1] must be within the a array, which is ensured by elements_r's existence.

So for each residue r, the possible q's are (r + i*p +1) for i in 0 to (l -m), where l is the length of elements_r.

So the problem now reduces to, for each residue r:

- collect elements_r as the elements of a in positions r, r+p, r+2p, etc.

- if the length of elements_r <m, skip.

- else, for each window of m consecutive elements in elements_r, check if the multiset of the window equals that of b.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The solution here is to precompute the frequency map of b, then for each elements_r, use a sliding window to track the frequency of elements in the current window, and compare with the frequency map of b.

But how to do this efficiently.

The steps would be:

1. Compute the frequency map of b. Let's call this target_freq. Also, compute the total number of elements in b, which is m. So for each window in elements_r, the window has exactly m elements. So for the window to match, the frequency of each element in the window must match exactly with target_freq.

2. For each elements_r list (length >=m):

   a. Initialize a sliding window of size m. Track the current frequency of elements in the window.

   b. For each element in the window, check if the frequency matches target_freq. If all elements in the window have frequencies matching target_freq, then this window is valid, and the corresponding q is added to the result.

   c. As we slide the window by one element (adding the next element and removing the first element of the window), update the current frequency and check again.

The key is that for each elements_r list, the sliding window approach can process each window in O(1) amortized time, leading to O(k) time per residue r, where k is the length of elements_r.

But considering that the sum of the lengths of all elements_r lists is equal to n (since each element of a is in exactly one elements_r list), the total time across all residues is O(n). Plus, the time to compare the current frequency with target_freq for each window. But comparing the entire frequency maps for each window is O(m) per window, which would be O(n) total if each window is checked once, but that's not feasible. So that approach would be too slow.

Wait, that's a problem. For example, if there are O(n/m) residues, each with O(m) elements, and for each window we check all keys in the target_freq, which can be O(m) in the worst case, leading to O(m * n/m * m) = O(nm) time, which is again 4e10 operations for n=2e5 and m=2e5. Not acceptable.

So we need a smarter way to track when the current window's frequency matches the target exactly.

Alternative approach:

We can track the number of mismatched elements between the current window and the target. When this number is zero, the window is valid.

To do this:

- Precompute target_freq.

- For each elements_r list:

   - Create a current_freq dictionary.

   - Initialize a mismatch counter, which counts how many elements in the current window have a frequency different from target_freq.

   - For the initial window (first m elements in elements_r):

      - For each element in the window, increment current_freq.

      - For each element in the window, check if current_freq[element] == target_freq[element]. For each element, if the current count after adding matches the target, decrement the mismatch counter. If not, increment. But this needs to be handled carefully.

   - Wait, perhaps a better way is:

      - Initialize the mismatch counter as the number of unique elements in the target_freq. Because for each element in target_freq, we need to have exactly that count in the current window.

      - Then, for each element in the initial window:

          - For each occurrence of an element e in the window:

              - If after adding to current_freq[e], the count equals target_freq.get(e, 0), then decrement the mismatch.

              - If the count was equal before, and now is not, increment the mismatch.

              - Else, if the count was not equal before and is not equal now, do nothing.

      Hmm, this seems complex. Another approach is:

      For each element e in the initial window:

          - Increment current_freq[e].

      Then, for each key in target_freq:

          - If current_freq[e] != target_freq[e], increment mismatch.

      Also, check if there are any elements in current_freq that are not in target_freq (i.e., elements that are in the window but not in b). For each such element, if current_freq[e] >0, it's a mismatch.

      Wait, but this requires checking all possible elements in the window, which could be O(m) per window. Which is again O(n) time.

      So this approach is not feasible.

      So perhaps a different approach is needed. We can use a count of how many elements are matching between the current window and target, and track this count as we slide the window.

      Let me think. The target_freq has certain elements and their counts. The current window can have elements not present in the target, which would immediately disqualify it. So the steps are:

      1. Precompute target_freq.

      2. For each elements_r list:

          a. For each window in elements_r of size m:

              i. Check if all elements in the window are present in target_freq.

              ii. For each such element, check that the frequency in the window matches the target.

              iii. Also, check that the sum of frequencies is m (since the window is size m, and the target is m).

          But this would require O(m) per window.

      But again, this is O(m * sum (k)) where k is the number of windows, which is O(n), leading to O(nm) time.

      So this approach is not feasible for large n and m.

Alternative Idea: Use a hash-based approach. Since the order doesn't matter, the multiset can be represented by a frequency map. The problem is that comparing frequency maps for each window is time-consuming. So perhaps we can precompute a rolling hash for the frequency map and compare the hashes.

But how to compute a rolling hash for the multiset. This is challenging because adding and removing elements affects the hash in a non-trivial way. For example, when moving the window, we remove the leftmost element and add the new right element. The hash would need to be updated based on these two operations.

Alternatively, we can use a sliding window approach where for each element added to the window, we update a hash that represents the multiset. But the problem is that this requires a way to represent the multiset uniquely and efficiently.

Another approach is to use a bloom filter or a cumulative frequency map. However, these may not be accurate.

Hmm. Another Idea: Since the order doesn't matter, perhaps the multiset can be represented by a sorted tuple. For example, for the window, we can sort the elements and compute a hash of the sorted tuple. Then, compare this hash to the hash of the sorted b. However, sorting each window would take O(m) time per window, which is again O(n) * O(m) time.

But for m up to 2e5, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: We can precompute the sorted list of b. Then, for each window, sort the elements and compare to the sorted b. But again, this is O(m log m) per window, which is not feasible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the elements can be rearranged. So the multiset must match. So the sorted list of the window must equal the sorted list of b. So if we precompute the sorted b, then for each window, we can sort the elements and compare.

But sorting each window of m elements would take O(m log m) time. If there are O(n) windows, then the total time is O(n m log m), which is way too slow for n=2e5 and m=2e5.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since the elements in each window are in the same residue mod p group, perhaps for each residue group, we can precompute a list of sorted elements and then use a sliding window to check if the sorted window matches the sorted b.

But this also doesn't help, because even if the elements are pre-sorted for the residue group, each window of m elements must be a contiguous block. Sorting the entire elements_r list would not make the window's sorted list the same as the sorted b unless the entire list is sorted, which is not the case.

So this approach isn't helpful.

Hmm. Let's think back to the sliding window frequency approach. The key problem is that for each window, checking the frequency is O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the target, which can be up to m (if all elements are unique). So that's O(m) per window. So for O(n/m) residues, each with O(m) windows, it's O(n) total windows. So O(nm) time again.

But what if we can track the number of mismatches and maintain it efficiently as we slide the window?

Yes! Let's try that.

Here's the plan:

For each residue r:

   elements_r is the list of elements in a for positions r mod p.

   if the length of elements_r is <m, skip.

   else:

      precompute the sorted version of b (sorted_b), and compute the target frequency map (target_freq).

      Initialize a frequency map (current_freq) to track the elements in the current window.

      Initialize a variable 'mismatches' which counts the number of elements in current_freq that do not match the target_freq. Also, need to track elements in current_freq that are not in target_freq, as they contribute to mismatches.

      For the first window (elements 0 to m-1 in elements_r):

          for each element in the window:

              current_freq[element] +=1

              if the element is not in target_freq:

                  mismatches +=1 (since this element is not supposed to be there)

              else:

                  if current_freq[element] == target_freq[element]:

                      if previous count was not equal, then mismatches -=1

                  elif current_freq[element] == target_freq[element] +1:

                      mismatches +=1 (if it was equal before, now it's not)

                  else:

                      (no change in mismatch status if it was already not equal)

          Wait, perhaps a better way is to track for each element in the current window:

              For each element e added to the window:

                  if e is in target_freq:

                      before = current_freq[e] (before increment)

                      after = before +1

                      if after == target_freq[e]:

                          if before != target_freq[e], then mismatches -=1

                      else:

                          if before == target_freq[e], then mismatches +=1

                      current_freq[e] +=1

                  else:

                      mismatches +=1 (since e is not in target_freq)

              Similarly for elements removed.

              But this requires handling each element addition and removal and checking how it affects the mismatch count.

              So when adding an element e:

                  if e is in target_freq:

                      prev_count = current_freq.get(e, 0)

                      new_count = prev_count +1

                      if prev_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches +=1 (since now new_count is not equal)

                      if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches -=1

                      current_freq[e] = new_count

                  else:

                      current_freq[e] = 1

                      mismatches +=1

              Similarly, when removing an element e:

                  if e is in target_freq:

                      prev_count = current_freq.get(e, 0)

                      new_count = prev_count -1

                      if prev_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches +=1 (since after decrement, it's not equal)

                      if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches -=1

                      current_freq[e] = new_count

                  else:

                      current_freq[e] -=1

                      if current_freq[e] ==0:

                          del current_freq[e]

                      mismatches -=1 (since the e is no longer present)

              Wait, this may not capture all cases. Let's think again.

              The 'mismatches' variable represents the total number of elements where the count in the current window is not equal to the target. So for each element in the current window (whether in target or not):

              If it's not in the target, then it contributes to a mismatch.

              For elements in the target, if their count in the current window is not equal to the target, they contribute to a mismatch.

              So the total mismatches is the sum over all elements in the current window of (whether their count in current_freq matches target_freq) plus any elements in the current window that are not in the target_freq.

              Wait, no. Because if an element is not in the target_freq, then any occurrence of it in the window is a mismatch. So for example, if the current window has an element x not present in target_freq, then even a single occurrence of x in the window is a mismatch.

              So the total mismatches is:

              sum over all elements e in current_freq:

                  if e is not in target_freq: 1 (because there's at least one occurrence)

                  else: 0 if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e], else 1

              So the maximum possible mismatches is the number of unique elements in current_freq (including those not in target_freq) plus the number of elements in target_freq where count doesn't match.

              Wait, no. For example, if the target has e with count 2, and current window has count 3, that's a mismatch. So for each element e in current_freq:

                  if e not in target_freq â†’ contributes 1.

                  else if current_freq[e] != target_freq[e] â†’ contributes 1.

              So the total mismatches is the number of elements in current_freq that are either not in target_freq or have a count different from target_freq.

              So when we add an element e to the window:

                  if e is not in target_freq:

                      if current_freq[e] was 0 before adding (so not present), then adding it increases mismatches by 1.

                      else, if current_freq[e] was already >0, then adding it doesn't change the mismatch status for e (since it was already contributing 1).

                  else:

                      previous_count = current_freq[e]

                      new_count = previous_count +1

                      if previous_count == target_freq[e]:

                          then before, the count was correct, but now it's not â†’ mismatches +=1.

                      else:

                          if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                              then mismatches decreases by 1.

                          else:

                              no change (was already mismatching, still is).

              Similarly for removing an element.

              So the idea is that when adding or removing elements, we can track how the mismatch count changes.

              So for the sliding window:

              - Initialize current_freq as empty.

              - Initialize mismatches as 0.

              - For the first window:

                  for each element in the first m elements of elements_r:

                      add to current_freq.

                      track how mismatches changes.

              Then, after the first window, mismatches is 0 if the window is valid.

              Then, as we slide the window, removing the left element and adding the next element, we update current_freq and mismatches accordingly.

              The key is that for each addition and removal, the changes in mismatches can be computed in O(1) time per element.

              So for each elements_r list, the time to process all possible windows is O(l), where l is the length of elements_r. Because for each of the l elements, each element is added once and removed once.

              And since the sum of all l across residues is n, the total time is O(n).

              Then, for each window where mismatches is 0, we can add the corresponding q to the result.

              This seems feasible.

              Now, let's outline the steps:

              Preprocessing:

              - Compute target_freq as a Counter for b.

              - Compute sorted_b = sorted(b). Not necessary, but may help in checking.

              For each residue r:

                  elements_r = [a[r], a[r+p], a[r+2p], ...]

                  l = len(elements_r)

                  if l < m: continue

                  current_freq = defaultdict(int)

                  mismatches = 0

                  valid_qs = []

                  # Process the first window [0..m-1]

                  for i in range(m):

                      e = elements_r[i]

                      # Add e to current_freq

                      if e in target_freq:

                          prev_count = current_freq[e]

                          current_freq[e] +=1

                          new_count = current_freq[e]

                              # e was added for the first time and is not in target

                              mismatches +=1

                  # After processing first window, check mismatches

                  if mismatches ==0:

                      # compute q

                      q = r + 0 * p +1

                      valid_qs.append(q)

                      else:

                          current_freq[removed_e] -=1

                          if current_freq[removed_e] ==0:

                              del current_freq[removed_e]

                          # check if after removal, removed_e is no longer in current_freq

                          # if current_freq[removed_e] was 1 before removal, then it contributed to mismatches, now it's gone, so mismatches -=1

                          # wait, how to track this.

                          # when we added removed_e, if it's not in target, then any occurrence contributes to a mismatch.

                          # So when we remove an occurrence, if the count goes to zero, then the mismatch contributed by this element is removed.

                          # For example, if removed_e is not in target, and current_freq[removed_e] was 1 before removal. After removal, it's 0. So the mismatch count decreases by 1.

                          # So:

                          if current_freq[removed_e] ==0:

                              # if this element was in current_freq with count 1 before removal, then it was contributing to mismatches. Now it's gone, so mismatch decreases by 1.

                              mismatches -=1

                          # Then, after decrementing, if current_freq[removed_e] is still non-zero, then no change (since the element is still present and contributes to mismatch)

                          # So, after the decrement, if the count is zero, we need to check if the element was contributing to the mismatch.

                          # But this is getting complicated.

                          # Alternative approach: when we remove an element not in target:

                          # if the count was 1 before removal â†’ it was contributing 1 to mismatches. After removal (count 0), it no longer contributes â†’ mismatches -=1.

                          # if the count was >1 before â†’ after removal, count is >0. So still contributes. No change.

                          # So in code:

                          if removed_e not in target_freq:

                              if current_freq[removed_e] ==1:

                                  # before removal, count was 1 â†’ contributed to mismatch. After removal, count is 0 â†’ no contribution.

                                  mismatches -=1

                              elif current_freq[removed_e] ==0:

                                  pass

                          # then proceed to delete if count is 0.

                          if new_count == target_freq[added_e]:

                              mismatches -=1

                      else:

                          current_freq[added_e] +=1

                          if current_freq[added_e] ==1:

                              # added_e was not present before â†’ contributes to mismatch

                              mismatches +=1

                      # Check if mismatches is zero

                      if mismatches ==0:

                          # compute q: the starting index in elements_r is i -m +1 â†’ i-m+1 is the starting index of the window [i-m+1, i]

                          # the elements_r index is i, so the window starts at (i -m +1) â†’ but how to get q?

                          # For the window starting at index (i -m +1) in elements_r:

                          # the original position in a is r + (i -m +1)*p

                          # so q is (r + (i -m +1)*p) +1 â†’ since the 0-based index is r + (i -m +1)*p, q is that plus 1.

                          q = r + (i -m +1)*p +1

                          valid_qs.append(q)

                  # Now, for all valid_qs in elements_r, add to the global list.

                  # But wait, the first window is processed before the loop. Then, in the loop, for i from m to l-1, the window is [i-m+1, i], which is correct.

                  # So the valid_qs for this residue are all the q's computed.

                  # Add these q's to the global list.

                  result.extend(valid_qs)

              After processing all residues, sort the result and output.

              So this approach should work in O(n) time.

              Now, let's test this logic against the sample input.

              Let's take the first sample:

              Input:

              5 3 1

              a = [1,2,3,2,1]

              b = [1,2,3]

              p=1. So residues are 0 mod 1 = 0.

              elements_r is [1,2,3,2,1].

              m=3.

              target_freq is {1:1, 2:1,3:1}.

              Processing elements_r:

              l =5.

              current_freq is initialized as empty.

              mismatches starts at 0.

              Process first 3 elements: 1,2,3.

              Add each to current_freq.

              For element 1:

                  in target_freq. prev_count 0 â†’ new_count 1.

                  prev_count (0) != target (1). So after adding, new_count == target â†’ mismatches decreases by 1.

              So mismatches becomes 0-1= -1? Wait, initial mismatches was 0.

              Wait, wait. Let's step through the code.

              For each element in the first window:

              For i=0 (element 1):

                  e=1 is in target_freq (target_freq[1] is 1).

                  current_freq[1] is 0.

                  prev_count is 0.

                  current_freq[1] +=1 â†’ new_count=1.

                  if prev_count == target (0 ==1? no). So no change.

                  new_count == target (1 ==1 â†’ yes). So mismatches decreases by 1 â†’ mismatches is 0-1= -1.

              Hmm, but initial mismatches is 0.

              Then, for element 2 (i=1):

                  e=2, in target_freq.

                  prev_count is 0.

                  new_count 1.

                  prev_count != target (0 vs 1). So no change.

                  new_count == target â†’ mismatches decreases by 1 â†’ now -2.

              For element 3 (i=2):

                  e=3, in target.

                  prev_count 0.

                  new_count 1.

                  same as before. mismatches becomes -3.

              So after processing the first window, mismatches is -3. But the code checks if mismatches is zero. So this would not be considered valid. But clearly, the first window's elements are [1,2,3], which matches b.

              So there's a mistake in the way mismatches is tracked.

              So the problem is in the way mismatches is updated.

              Let's re-examine the code:

              When adding e to current_freq:

              if e is in target_freq:

                  prev_count = current_freq.get(e, 0)

                  new_count = prev_count +1

                  current_freq[e] = new_count

                  if prev_count == target_freq[e]:

                      mismatches +=1  # because after incrementing, it's now different.

                  if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                      mismatches -=1

              So for e=1, prev_count is 0 (not equal to target 1). So adding 1 to make new_count=1. Then, since new_count equals target, mismatches decreases by 1. But mismatches was initialized to 0, so mismatches is now -1.

              This is incorrect. Because initially, the mismatch count is the number of elements in current_freq that are not in target_freq, plus the elements in target_freq where current count is not equal to target.

              Wait, but in the first step, the code's initial mismatches is zero. But when adding e=1, which is in target_freq, prev_count is 0. Since target_freq[e] is 1, the current count (prev_count) is not equal. So when we add e=1, the new count is 1, which is equal to target. So the mismatch for e=1 is resolved, so the total mismatches would decrease by 1 (from 0 to -1, which is incorrect).

              So the problem is that the code is tracking mismatches as a count that can be negative, which is wrong.

              Because the initial mismatches is zero, but the actual mismatches after adding the first element would be zero (since current_freq has e=1 with count 1, which matches the target). But according to the code, after adding the first element, mismatches is -1, which is incorrect.

              So the code's logic for updating mismatches is flawed.

              Let's re-express the logic for adding an element e.

              For adding e:

                  if e is in target_freq:

                      prev_count = current_freq[e]

                      new_count = prev_count +1

                      current_freq[e] = new_count

                      # check if prev_count was correct

                      if prev_count == target_freq[e]:

                          # it was correct before adding, now it's new_count = prev_count +1, which may not be correct.

                          # So the element e now has a count that is different from target.

                          # So mismatches increases by 1.

                          mismatches +=1

                      # check if new_count is correct.

                      if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                          # So after adding, the count is correct.

                          # So mismatches decreases by 1.

                          mismatches -=1

                  else:

                      current_freq[e] +=1

                      # if this is the first occurrence of e in the window (current_freq[e] ==1), then e is not in target, so add 1 to mismatches.

                      if current_freq[e] ==1:

                          mismatches +=1

              For example, when adding e=1 (first element):

                  e is in target_freq.

                  prev_count =0.

                  new_count=1.

                  prev_count == target_freq[e] (0 ==1 â†’ no). So no change to mismatches.

                  new_count == target_freq[e] (1 ==1 â†’ yes). So mismatches -=1 â†’ from 0 to -1.

              This is wrong.

              The correct logic should be:

              For each element e in the window, whether e is in target or not:

                  if e is not in target â†’ contributes 1 to mismatches.

                  else if current_freq[e] != target_freq[e] â†’ contributes 1.

              So when adding e:

                  if e is not in target â†’ if current_freq[e] was 0 before adding, then adding it (now count 1) contributes 1 to mismatches. So mismatches +=1.

                  else, e is in target:

                      previous_count = current_freq[e]

                      new_count = previous_count +1

                      if previous_count == target â†’ then after incrementing, it's different â†’ mismatches +=1.

                      if new_count == target â†’ mismatches -=1.

                      So net change is (if previous_count == target) â†’ mismatches +=1 - (if new_count == target â†’ 1 else 0)

              Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to track how each addition or removal affects the mismatches.

              For example:

              When adding an element e:

                  if e is not in target:

                      if current_freq[e] was 0 â†’ add 1 to mismatches (since now e is present and not in target).

                      else â†’ no change (already contributes to mismatches).

                  else:

                      previous_count = current_freq[e]

                      new_count = previous_count +1

                      current_freq[e] = new_count

                      if previous_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches +=1 (since previous count was correct, new count is not)

                      if new_count == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches -=1

              So for the first element e=1:

                  e is in target.

                  previous_count is 0 â†’ not equal to target (1).

                  new_count is 1 â†’ equals target.

                  So:

                      previous_count == target? No â†’ so no addition to mismatches.

                      new_count == target? yes â†’ mismatches decreases by 1. But initial mismatches is 0.

                      So mismatches becomes -1.

              But this is incorrect. Because after adding e=1, the frequency of e=1 is 1, which matches target_freq. So the mismatch for e=1 is resolved. The total mismatches should be 0 (since there are no other elements).

              So the code's logic is incorrect.

              The problem is that the initial mismatches is zero, but when adding elements, the code uses a delta approach which can lead to negative values.

              So perhaps the initial mismatches should be the number of elements in target_freq. Because each element in target_freq must have exactly the required count. If the initial current_freq is empty, then for each element in target_freq, the count is zero, which is less than required. So the initial mismatches should be the number of elements in target_freq.

              Wait, but this approach is also not correct. For example, if target_freq has two elements, each requiring one occurrence. The first window adds two elements, one of each. Then, the mismatches would be zero.

              Let's try to model this correctly.

              The initial state is current_freq is empty. So for each element in target_freq, the current count is zero. So for each element in target_freq, the current count is less than target. So mismatches is the number of elements in target_freq.

              Then, when adding elements:

                  for e in window:

                      if e is not in target_freq â†’ increment mismatch by 1.

                      else:

                          current_freq[e] +=1.

                          if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] â†’ decrement mismatches by 1.

                          elif current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] +1 â†’ increment mismatches by 1.

              This way, mismatches is initialized to the number of elements in target_freq (since all are zero and need to reach the target), and for each element added:

                  if e is not in target â†’ mismatches +=1.

                  else:

                      if after adding, the count equals target â†’ mismatches -=1.

                      if after adding, the count exceeds target â†’ mismatches +=1.

              So for the first sample:

              target_freq has three elements (1,2,3), each with count 1. So initial mismatches is 3.

              When adding 1:

                  e is in target_freq. current_freq[1] becomes 1. Which equals target. So mismatches -=1 â†’ 2.

              Adding 2: current_freq[2] becomes 1 â†’ equals target. mismatches -=1 â†’ 1.

              Adding 3: current_freq[3] becomes 1 â†’ equals target. mismatches -=1 â†’ 0.

              So after the first window, mismatches is 0 â†’ valid.

              This is correct.

              Then, when sliding the window to add 2 and remove 1:

                  removed_e=1 (first element). current_freq[1] becomes 0.

                  Since target_freq[1] is 1, current count is 0. So mismatches +=1 (since previous count was 1, which was correct. Now it's 0, which is wrong).

                  Then, added_e=2. current_freq[2] becomes 2. target is 1. So now, current count (2) exceeds target. So mismatches +=1. So mismatches is now 2.

              But the window [2,3,2] is not a match. So the code correctly reports mismatches 2.

              So this approach seems better.

              So the correct way to track mismatches is:

              - Initially, for each element in target_freq, the required count is target_freq[e]. So initially, current_freq is empty, so each element's count is 0. Thus, mismatches starts as the number of elements in target_freq.

              - For each element added to the window:

                  if the element is not in target_freq â†’ mismatches +=1.

                  else:

                      current_freq[e] +=1.

                      if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches -=1.

                      elif current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] +1:

                          mismatches +=1.

              - For each element removed from the window:

                  if the element is not in target_freq â†’ mismatches -=1 (if after removal, the count is zero).

                  else:

                      current_freq[e] -=1.

                      if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e]:

                          mismatches -=1.

                      elif current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] -1:

                          mismatches +=1.

              So this approach requires initializing mismatches as the number of elements in target_freq.

              Then, for each element added or removed, adjust the mismatches based on how their counts change.

              This seems more accurate.

              So let's rework the code according to this logic.

              The steps are:

              1. Precompute target_freq.

              2. For each residue r:

                  elements_r = list of a[r], a[r+p], etc.

                  l = len(elements_r)

                  if l <m â†’ skip.

                  else:

                      current_freq = defaultdict(int)

                      mismatches = len(target_freq)  # each element in target starts with 0 count, so mismatches is the number of elements.

                      valid_qs = []

                      # Process the first window

                      for i in range(m):

                          e = elements_r[i]

                          if e not in target_freq:

                              mismatches +=1

                          else:

                              current_freq[e] +=1

                              if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e]:

                                  mismatches -=1

                              elif current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] +1:

                                  mismatches +=1

                      # Check if mismatches is zero and no elements not in target are present.

                      # Wait, no. Because if there are elements not in target, mismatches would have been increased.

                      # So if mismatches is zero and current_freq has no elements not in target, then it's valid.

                      # So in addition to mismatches being zero, we need to ensure that there are no elements in current_freq that are not in target_freq.

                      # Because mismatches is the number of elements in target_freq that have incorrect counts plus the number of elements not in target_freq present in the window.

                      # Wait, no. Because when adding an element not in target, we increment mismatches by 1. So mismatches includes these elements.

                      # So if mismatches is zero, it means that:

                      # 1. For all elements in target_freq, current_freq[e] == target_freq[e]

                      # 2. There are no elements in current_freq not in target_freq.

                      Because for each element not in target_freq added to current_freq, mismatches is increased by 1. So if mismatches is zero, there are no such elements.

                      So if mismatches ==0, then the window is valid.

                      So after processing the first window, check if mismatches is zero.

                      if mismatches ==0:

                          q = r + 0*p +1 â†’ q= r+1, since i=0 in elements_r.

                          valid_qs.append(q)

                      # Now slide the window

                      for i in range(m, l):

                          # Remove element elements_r[i -m]

                          removed_e = elements_r[i -m]

                          if removed_e not in target_freq:

                              # if this element was in the window and is not in target, then removing it may decrease mismatches.

                              # current_freq[removed_e] was >=1.

                              current_freq[removed_e] -=1

                              if current_freq[removed_e] ==0:

                                  del current_freq[removed_e]

                                  mismatches -=1

                          else:

                              current_freq[removed_e] -=1

                              # check how this affects mismatches

                              if current_freq[removed_e] == target_freq[removed_e] -1:

                                  # before decrement, it was target, now it's target-1 â†’ mismatch increases.

                                  mismatches +=1

                              elif current_freq[removed_e] == target_freq[removed_e]:

                                  # before decrement, it was target+1, now target â†’ mismatch decreases.

                                  mismatches -=1

                          # Add new element elements_r[i]

                          added_e = elements_r[i]

                          if added_e not in target_freq:

                              current_freq[added_e] +=1

                              if current_freq[added_e] ==1:

                                  mismatches +=1

                          else:

                              current_freq[added_e] +=1

                              if current_freq[added_e] == target_freq[added_e]:

                                  mismatches -=1

                              elif current_freq[added_e] == target_freq[added_e] +1:

                                  mismatches +=1

                          # Check mismatches

                          if mismatches ==0:

                              q = r + (i -m +1)*p +1

                              valid_qs.append(q)

                      # Add valid_qs to the result

                      result.extend(valid_qs)

              This seems more accurate.

              Let's re-test the first sample.

              Sample 1:

              a = [1,2,3,2,1]

              p=1, m=3.

              residue r=0.

              elements_r = [1,2,3,2,1]

              target_freq has three elements (1:1, 2:1, 3:1). So initial mismatches is 3.

              Process first 3 elements (1,2,3):

              For e=1 (element 0):

                  e is in target. current_freq[1] becomes 1.

                  current_freq[e] == target â†’ mismatches decreases by 1 â†’ 3-1=2.

              For e=2 (element 1):

                  current_freq[2] becomes 1 â†’ matches target. mismatches 2-1=1.

              For e=3 (element 2):

                  current_freq[3] becomes 1 â†’ matches. mismatches 1-1=0.

              So mismatches is 0. So q=0 +0*1 +1 =1. valid_qs appends 1.

              Then, sliding window for i=3 (element index 3):

                  removed_e= elements_r[0] =1.

                  removed_e is in target.

                  current_freq[1] was 1. Decrement to 0.

                  current_freq[1] becomes 0 â†’ which is target_freq[1] -1 (0 =1-1). So mismatches increases by 1 â†’ now 1.

                  added_e= elements_r[3] =2.

                  added_e is in target. current_freq[2] becomes 2.

                  current_freq[2] is now target_freq[2] +1 (2=1+1). So mismatches increases by 1 â†’ total 2.

                  So mismatches is 2 â†’ no valid q.

              Next slide (i=4):

                  removed_e= elements_r[1] =2.

                  current_freq[2] was 2. Decrement to 1.

                  Now current_freq[2] is 1 â†’ matches target. So mismatches decreases by 1 â†’ 2-1=1.

                  added_e= elements_r[4] =1.

                  added_e is in target. current_freq[1] becomes 1.

                  current_freq[1] now equals target â†’ mismatches decreases by 1 â†’ 0.

                  So mismatches is 0. valid_q is r=0 + (4-3 +1 -1)*1 +1 â†’ wait, wait.

                  i is 4, m=3. i -m +1 =4-3+1=2. So the window starts at index 2 in elements_r: elements_r[2], 3,4 â†’ elements [3,2,1].

                  So q is r + (i-m+1)*p +1 â†’ 0 + 2*1 +1=3.

                  So valid_qs appends 3.

              So after processing all, valid_qs for residue 0 are [1,3], which matches the sample.

              So this logic works.

              Now, the code needs to implement this logic.

              Now, for the second sample:

              Input:

              6 3 2

              a = [1,3,2,2,3,1]

              b = [1,2,3]

              p=2.

              residues are 0 and 1.

              For residue 0: elements_r = [1,2,3,1] â†’ positions 0,2,4,6 (but n=6, so positions are 0,2,4 â†’ elements [1,2,3]. Wait, wait:

              n=6, p=2. So residue 0: positions 0, 2,4. residue 1: positions 1,3,5.

              elements_r for residue 0: [1,2,3]. For residue 1: [3,2,1].

              m=3.

              target_freq is {1:1, 2:1,3:1}.

              For residue 0:

                  elements_r has length 3, which equals m.

                  initial mismatches is 3.

                  process elements 1,2,3:

                  for e=1: current_freq[1] =1 â†’ matches target â†’ mismatches-1 â†’ 2.

                  e=2: current_freq[2]=1 â†’ matches â†’ mismatches 1.

                  e=3: current_freq[3]=1 â†’ matches â†’ mismatches 0.

                  So q =0 +0*2 +1 =1. valid_qs append 1.

                  residue 0 contributes q=1.

              For residue 1:

                  elements_r is [3,2,1].

                  processing first window:

                  e=3 â†’ current_freq[3] =1 â†’ matches â†’ mismatches 3-1=2.

                  e=2 â†’ current_freq[2] =1 â†’ mismatches 2-1=1.

                  e=1 â†’ current_freq[1]=1 â†’ mismatches 0. So q =1 +0*2 +1 =2.

                  Then, sliding window: since l=3, m=3, there are no more windows.

                  So valid_qs for residue 1 is [2].

              So the valid q's are 1 and 2 â†’ which matches the sample.

              So the code works.

              Now, the code needs to be implemented.

              Now, let's proceed to write the code.

              Steps in code:

              1. Read n, m, p.

              2. Read a as a list of integers.

              3. Read b as a list of integers.

              4. Compute target_freq as a Counter(b).

              5. Check if m is zero (but according to constraints, m>=1, so no).

              6. Check if (m-1)*p >=n â†’ then output 0.

              Or compute max_q = n - (m-1)*p. If max_q <1 â†’ output 0.

              7. Else, proceed.

              8. For each residue r in 0..p-1:

                  elements_r = a[r::p]

                  l = len(elements_r)

                  if l <m â†’ skip.

                  else:

                      process the sliding window.

              Now, code:

              But let's think about the data structures.

              Using a defaultdict for current_freq.

              Also, for target_freq, we can use a normal dict.

              Now, the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, Counter


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m, p = map(int, input_stream.readline().split())
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))

    target_freq = Counter(b)
    unique_b_count = len(target_freq)

    result = []

    max_q = n - (m-1)*p
    if max_q < 1:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        print(file=output_stream)
        sys.exit()

    for r in range(p):
        elements_r = a[r::p]
        l = len(elements_r)
        if l < m:
            continue
        current_freq = defaultdict(int)
        mismatches = len(target_freq)  # initially, each element in target has count 0.

        valid_qs = []

        # Process first window
        for i in range(m):
            e = elements_r[i]
            if e not in target_freq:
                # element not in target; increment mismatches
                mismatches +=1
            else:
                current_freq[e] +=1
                if current_freq[e] == target_freq[e]:
                    mismatches -=1
                elif current_freq[e] == target_freq[e] +1:
                    mismatches +=1

        if mismatches ==0 and not any(e not in target_freq for e in current_freq):
            # Wait, no. Because mismatches includes elements not in target_freq. So if mismatches is zero, then current_freq has no elements not in target_freq.

            # So if mismatches is zero, then valid.

            q = r + 0 * p +1
            valid_qs.append(q)

        # Slide window
        for i in range(m, l):
            removed_e = elements_r[i - m]

            # Remove from current_freq
            if removed_e not in target_freq:
                current_freq[removed_e] -=1
                if current_freq[removed_e] ==0:
                    del current_freq[removed_e]
                if current_freq.get(removed_e, 0) ==0:
                    mismatches -=1
            else:
                current_freq[removed_e] -=1
                if current_freq[removed_e] == target_freq[removed_e] -1:
                    mismatches +=1
                elif current_freq[removed_e] == target_freq[removed_e]:
                    mismatches -=1

            # Add new element
            added_e = elements_r[i]
            if added_e not in target_freq:
                current_freq[added_e] +=1
                if current_freq[added_e] ==1:
                    mismatches +=1
            else:
                current_freq[added_e] +=1
                if current_freq[added_e] == target_freq[added_e]:
                    mismatches -=1
                elif current_freq[added_e] == target_freq[added_e] +1:
                    mismatches +=1

            # Check for validity
            if mismatches ==0:
                window_start_index_in_elements_r = i -m +1
                q = r + window_start_index_in_elements_r * p +1
                valid_qs.append(q)

        result.extend(valid_qs)

    # Sort the result and output
    result.sort()
    print(len(result), file=output_stream)
    if result:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)), file=output_stream)
    else:
        print(file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

              Edge Case 2: p is larger than n.

              For example, p=1e5, n=1e4. Then, each elements_r list has at most one element. If m=1, then each elements_r list is processed. Otherwise, no.

              So code handles this.

              Edge Case 3: All elements of a are the same, and b is the same. For example, a = [5,5,5], b=[5], m=1. So all possible q's are valid.

              The code should output all possible q's.

              Now, the code needs to efficiently handle large data.

              To optimize for speed, using defaultdict is crucial. Also, avoid any unnecessary operations.

              Now, in the code, when processing the first window, the code checks for any elements in current_freq not in target_freq. But according to the mismatches logic, if mismatches is zero, there can't be any elements in current_freq not in target_freq. Because any such element would have caused mismatches to increase by 1. So if mismatches is zero, then there are no elements not in target_freq.

              So the code can omit that check and rely solely on mismatches ==0.

              So the line:

              if mismatches ==0 and not any(e not in target_freq for e in current_freq):

              can be simplified to:

              if mismatches ==0:

              because the mismatches would only be zero if there are no elements not in target_freq.

              So the code can remove the 'any' check.

              Thus, the code becomes:

              if mismatches ==0:

                  q = r + 0 * p +1

                  valid_qs.append(q)

              Similarly for the sliding windows.

              This improves efficiency.

              So the code is correct.

              Now, the code is ready.
