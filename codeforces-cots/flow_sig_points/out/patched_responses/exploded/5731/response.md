Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of distinct subsequences of a given bracket sequence that are RSBS. Let's think about what RSBS means. Oh right, the definition says that an RSBS is a bracket sequence that's not empty, even length, the first half are all '(', and the second half are all ')'. So for example, "((...))" where the number of '(' is equal to the number of ')'.

So the problem is to find all possible subsequences of the input string that form such RSBS. And each such subsequence must be distinct in terms of the positions selected. The answer needs to be modulo 1e9+7.

Hmm. Let's start by understanding the structure of a valid RSBS. Let's say the RSBS has length 2k. Then the first k characters are '(', and the next k are ')'. So any valid subsequence must consist of k '('s followed by k ')'s.

The approach here is to find all possible pairs of k '(' and k ')', such that the '('s are taken from the left part of the original string, and the ')'s are taken from the right part. Wait, but how do we model that?

Alternatively, for each possible k, we can compute the number of ways to choose k '('s from the available ones in the input, and k ')'s from the available ones, but ensuring that the selected '('s appear before the selected ')'s in the original string.

Wait, but the order in the original string matters. For a subsequence to be valid, all the selected '('s must come before all the selected ')'s. So for each k, we need to find the number of ways to choose k '('s and k ')'s such that all the '('s in the subsequence are to the left of all the ')'s.

So the steps could be:

1. Precompute for each position in the string the number of '('s to the left (including current) and the number of ')'s to the right (including current).

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think. For each possible k, we need to choose k '('s from the left part and k ')'s from the right part, such that the leftmost ')' in the chosen ')'s is after the rightmost '(' in the chosen '('s.

Alternatively, for each occurrence of '(', we can consider how many ')'s are to the right of it. Then, for each k, the total is the sum over all possible combinations of k '('s and k ')'s where each ')' is after the last '(' in the subset.

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Let's think of a dynamic programming approach or some combinatoric way.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

The valid RSBS is formed by choosing some k pairs of '(' and ')'. Let's say we pick a set of positions for the k '('s and then a set of positions for the k ')', such that all '(' positions are before all ') positions. The number of such pairs is the product of the combinations for choosing k '('s from the available ones and k ')'s from the available ones that are after the last '(' chosen.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Wait, here's a better approach. Let's precompute two arrays:

- For every index i, the number of '('s in the prefix up to i. Let's say left[i] is the number of '('s from 0 to i (inclusive).
- For every index j, the number of ')'s in the suffix starting at j. So right[j] is the number of ')'s from j to end (inclusive).

Then, for each possible split point where the last '(' chosen is at position i, and the first ')' chosen is at position j, where j > i, the number of ways is C(left[i], k) * C(right[j], k). Wait, but this seems complicated. Also, k can vary.

Alternatively, here's a key insight: for a valid RSBS of length 2k, all the chosen '('s must be some subset of the first m '('s, and all the chosen ')'s must be some subset of the last n ')', such that the positions of the last '(' in the chosen set is before the positions of the first ')' in the chosen set.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently. Let's collect all the positions of '(' in the string and the positions of ')' in the string. Suppose there are a '('s and b ')'s. For a valid RSBS of length 2k, we need to choose k '('s from the a available ones and k ')'s from the b available ones, such that all the chosen '('s are before all the chosen ')'.

So the problem reduces to finding the sum over all possible k of (number of ways to choose k '('s from the a) multiplied by (number of ways to choose k ')'s from the b) where the last chosen '(' is before the first chosen ')'.

Wait, but how do we ensure that the last '(' is before the first ')'?

Hmm, but the positions of the chosen '('s must all be before the positions of the chosen ')'s. So, if I have a set of k '(' positions and a set of k ')' positions, all the '(' positions are before any of the ')' positions.

So, the way to compute this is:

For each possible k, we can compute the number of ways to choose k '('s and k ')'s such that the maximum position of the '('s is less than the minimum position of the ')'s.

Let me denote the list of '(' positions as L = [l1, l2, ..., la], sorted in increasing order (since the string is scanned left to right). Similarly, the list of ')' positions as R = [r1, r2, ..., rb], sorted in increasing order.

For each k, we need to choose a subset of k elements from L (call them L_sub) and a subset of k elements from R (call them R_sub), such that max(L_sub) < min(R_sub).

The number of such pairs for a particular k is the sum over all possible i and j where L[i] < R[j], and the number of ways to choose k-1 elements from the first i elements (since L[i] is the last selected '('), and k-1 elements from the remaining elements from j to end (since R[j] is the first selected ')').

Alternatively, for each possible i in L (the position of the last '(' chosen) and j in R (the position of the first ') chosen), where L[i] < R[j], the number of ways is (C(i, k-1)) * C(b - j + 1, k-1)), where i is the index in L (0-based), and j is the index in R (0-based).

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Suppose L is the list of all '(' positions, sorted. So the first element is the first '(', etc. Similarly, R is the list of all ')', sorted.

Suppose we choose k '('s from L. The last selected '(' is at position L[i]. Then, we have to choose k-1 '('s from the first i elements (since the last one is fixed as L[i]). Similarly, for the ')', the first selected is R[j], and we have to choose k-1 ')'s from the elements after j (since the first is R[j], and the rest must come after j to have min R_sub as R[j]).

So for a given i and j where L[i] < R[j], the number of ways for this particular pair (i,j) is (combination(i, k-1) ) * ( combination( (b-1) - j +1, k-1 ) ). Because after choosing L[i] as the last '(', we have i elements before it (since the list is 0-based, indexes 0 to i-1), and we need to choose k-1 of them. For the ')', once R[j] is selected as the first, there are (b-1 - j +1) elements after j (since j is 0-based), which is (b - j) elements. Wait, if R has elements from 0 to b-1 (assuming b is the count of ')'), then the number of elements after j (exclusive) is (b-1 - j). So the combination for the ')' would be C( (b-1 - j), k-1 ), since we need to choose k-1 elements from the remaining (b-1 - j) elements (as the first is R[j], the rest must be after j).

But then the total for k is the sum over all i and j where L[i] < R[j] of (C(i, k-1) * C(b - j -1, k-1)).

This seems computationally expensive if done naively, especially for large a and b. The constraints say the input length can be up to 2e5, so a and b can be up to 2e5 each. So the approach of iterating all possible i and j for each k would be O(a*b) per k, which is not feasible.

We need a smarter way to compute this sum for all possible k.

Alternative idea: For each possible k, precompute the possible i and j where L[i] < R[j], and compute the sum of combinations.

But even this seems challenging. Let's think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps for a given k, the maximum possible i is such that there are at least k '('s (i >= k-1), and the maximum i is a-1. Similarly, for j, the minimum j is such that there are at least k ')'s in the suffix (j <= b -k).

But how to efficiently compute the sum over i and j where L[i] < R[j] of C(i, k-1) * C(b - j -1, k-1).

Alternatively, we can precompute for each ')', the number of '('s that are before it. For each R[j], the number of i where L[i] < R[j] is the number of elements in L that are less than R[j], which is the count of '('s before R[j]. Let's call that c_j.

Then, for a given j, the sum over i where L[i] < R[j] of C(i, k-1) is equal to the sum of C(i, k-1) for all i in 0 to m-1, where m is the number of '('s before R[j]. Because the list L is sorted, and R[j] is a position in the string. So the number of '('s before R[j] is the number of elements in L that are < R[j]. Let's precompute for each R[j], the maximum index m_j in L such that L[m_j] < R[j]. Then m_j+1 is the count of '('s before R[j].

But how to compute this efficiently. For each R[j], m_j is the largest index i where L[i] < R[j]. Since L is sorted, we can perform a binary search for R[j] in L and find the insertion point, which gives m_j +1.

Once we have m_j, the sum over i (from k-1 to m_j) of C(i, k-1) is equal to C(m_j +1, k). Because sum_{i= t}^{m} C(i, t) = C(m+1, t+1). For example, sum_{i=0}^m C(i,0) = m+1 = C(m+1,1). Sum_{i=1}^m C(i,1) = C(m+1, 2). So in general, sum_{i=k-1}^{m_j} C(i, k-1) = C(m_j +1, k).

So for each j, the contribution for a given k is C(m_j +1, k) * C(b - j -1, k-1).

Then the total for k is the sum over j of C(m_j +1, k) * C( (b - j -1), k-1 ), multiplied by 1 (since each j is a possible first ') in the subset).

Wait, no. Wait, the term C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) is the number of ways to choose the remaining k-1 ')'s from the ones after j. Because once we choose j as the first ') in the subset, the remaining k-1 have to be in positions after j. So the number of ways is C( (b- j -1) choose (k-1) ), since there are (b - j -1) ')'s after j (assuming j is 0-based in the R list). For example, if j is the 0th element (first ') in R), then the number of ')'s after is b-1 - j = b-1 -0 = b-1. So the term is C(b- j -1, k-1).

So for each k, the total is the sum over all j (0-based in R) of [ C(m_j +1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) ].

But how to compute this sum efficiently for all possible k.

Wait, but the possible k's are from 1 up to the minimum of the number of '('s and the number of ')'s. Let's say a is the number of '(', b is the number of ')'. Then maximum k is min(a, b). So for each possible k from 1 to min(a,b), we need to compute the sum over j of C(m_j +1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ), and sum all these for each k, then sum over all k to get the total answer.

But with a and b up to 2e5 each, this approach is O(b * min(a, b)), which could be 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.

So this approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute for each possible j, the possible k's where (b-j-1) >= k-1 and m_j +1 >=k. Then for each j, the term is added to k from max(1, ...) up to min(m_j +1, (b-j-1)+1).

But even then, the per j processing might be O(1) with some combinatoric tricks.

Wait, but maybe we can model this sum as a product of two generating functions and find the sum over k of [sum_j (C(m_j+1, k) * C(b-j-1, k-1)) ].

But how to compute that. Let's think of each j's contribution as a polynomial in terms of k. Then the total for each j is the coefficient of x^k in the product of (1 + x)^{m_j+1} } and (x*(1 + x)^{b-j-1} }, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps the sum over k of C(m_j+1, k) * C(b-j-1, k-1) can be written as C(m_j +1 + b-j-1, m_j +1 - (k-1) + (b-j-1) - (k-1) ) ??? Not sure. Wait, maybe using the Vandermonde's identity.

Wait, the term C(m+1, k) * C(n, k-1) can be written as C(n, k-1) * C(m+1, k). Let me think: n is (b-j-1), and m is m_j. So sum over k of C(m+1, k) * C(n, k-1) = sum over k of C(m+1, k) * C(n, (k-1)). Let's let l = k-1. Then sum over l of C(m+1, l+1) * C(n, l). Which is sum_l [ C(m+1, l+1) * C(n, l) ].

Hmm, perhaps there's a combinatorial identity here. Let's see: C(m+1, l+1) = C(m+1, m - l). So the product is C(m+1, m - l) * C(n, l).

The sum over l of C(m+1, m-l) * C(n, l) is equivalent to the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^{m+1} * (1 + x)^n. Because (1 + x)^{m+1} has terms C(m+1, k) x^k. (1 + x)^n has terms C(n, l) x^l. The product is sum_{k} sum_{l} C(m+1, k) C(n, l) x^{k + l}. The coefficient of x^m is sum_{k + l = m} C(m+1, k) C(n, l). But here, l is from 0 to m. So when k = m - l. Then sum_{l=0 to m} C(m+1, m-l) * C(n, l) = sum_{l} C(m+1, l+1) * C(n, l) (since m-l = l' → l' = m-l → when l ranges from 0 to m, l' ranges from m to 0. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum over k of C(a, k) * C(b, k) is C(a + b, a -k) for some conditions, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the sum over k of C(m+1, k) * C(n, k-1) can be rewritten as C(m+1 +n, k-1 + (k)) * ... no, not sure.

Alternatively, let's make a substitution. Let's think of k as varying from 1 to min(m+1, n+1). So the sum is sum_{k=1}^t [ C(m+1, k) * C(n, k-1) }, where t is the minimum of m+1 and n+1.

But how to compute this sum.

Wait, for each j, the contribution to the total answer is the sum over k of C(m_j +1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ), and the total answer is the sum over j of this sum.

So the total answer is sum_j sum_k [ C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) }.

Let's reverse the order of summation. The total is sum_k sum_j [ C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) }.

So for each k, compute the sum over j of C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ), then sum over all k.

But how to compute this sum for all k efficiently.

Alternative idea: For each j, the term C(m_j+1, k) * C(b-j-1, k-1) can be simplified. Let's see:

C(m_j+1, k) * C(b-j-1, k-1) = C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), (k-1) )

But (b-j-1) choose (k-1) is the same as C( (b-j-1), (b-j-1 - (k-1) )) = C( (b-j-1), (b-j -k) ), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given j, and varying k, this product can be viewed as part of a generating function. For example, for each j, the contribution to all k's is the sum over k of C(m_j+1, k) * C(n_j, k-1), where n_j = (b-j-1). Let me compute this sum.

sum_{k} C(m_j+1, k) * C(n_j, k-1) 

Let's change variable: let l = k-1. Then the sum becomes sum_{l=0}^{n_j} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C(n_j, l).

This can be rewritten as sum_{l} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C(n_j, l).

Now, C(m+1, l+1) = C(m+1, m - l). So sum_{l} C(m+1, m-l) * C(n_j, l) 

But this sum is equal to C(m+1 + n_j, m). Because of the Vandermonde's identity. Wait, Vandermonde's identity is sum_{k} C(a, k) * C(b, r -k) ) = C(a + b, r). But here, the sum is sum_{l} C(m+1, (m+1) - (l+1)) ) * C(n_j, l) ) → sum_{l} C(m+1, m - l) * C(n_j, l) → sum_{l} C(m+1, l') * C(n_j, l), where l' = m - l. So sum_{l} C(m+1, m-l) * C(n_j, l) → sum_{l} C(m+1, l') * C(n_j, l) where l' + l = m. So sum_{l} C(m+1, l') * C(n_j, l) where l' = m - l. But this is the same as sum_{l} C(m+1, m-l) * C(n_j, l) = sum_{l} C(m+1, l') * C(n_j, l) with l' = m - l. The sum is the coefficient of x^m in (1+x)^{m+1} * (1+x)^{n_j} } → (1+x)^{m+1 + n_j} }, so the coefficient is C(m+1 +n_j, m).

So sum_{k} C(m_j+1, k) * C( n_j, k-1 ) = C( m_j+1 + n_j, m_j + 1 - (k) + ... ) → no, according to the above substitution, the sum is C(m_j+1 + n_j, m) where m is m_j+1 + n_j choose m. Wait, m is the exponent from the product.

Wait, in the Vandermonde approach, sum_{l} C(a, l) * C(b, r - l) ) = C(a + b, r). But in our case, the sum is sum_{l} C(m+1, l) * C(n_j, m - l) → which is the coefficient of x^m in (1+x)^{m+1} * (1+x)^{n_j} = (1+x)^{m+1 +n_j} → so the coefficient is C(m+1 + n_j, m).

So sum_{l} C(m+1, l) * C(n_j, m - l) = C(m+1 +n_j, m).

But in our case, the sum is sum_{l} C(m+1, l+1) * C(n_j, l). Let me make a substitution l = k-1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me go back:

Original sum for j: sum_{k} C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 )

Let n_j = (b-j-1). So the sum is sum_{k} C(m_j+1, k) * C(n_j, k-1) = sum_{k=1} C(m_j+1, k) * C(n_j, k-1).

Change variable: l = k-1 → sum_{l=0} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C(n_j, l).

Which is sum_{l=0} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C(n_j, l).

But C(m_j+1, l+1) = C(m_j+1, m_j+1 - (l+1)) = C(m_j+1, m_j - l).

So sum_l C(m_j+1, m_j - l) * C(n_j, l) = sum_l C(m_j+1, m_j - l) * C(n_j, l) → let's change variable to t = l. Then sum_t C(m_j+1, m_j - t) * C(n_j, t).

But this is the same as sum_t C(m_j+1, m_j - t) * C(n_j, t) = sum_t C(m_j+1, t') ) * C(n_j, t) where t' = m_j - t. Then t' + t = m_j - t + t = m_j. So the sum is sum_{t=0}^n C(m_j+1, t') * C(n_j, t) where t' = m_j - t. The sum is equal to the coefficient of x^{m_j} in (1 + x)^{m_j+1} * (1 + x)^{n_j} }, which is (1 + x)^{m_j+1 + n_j} → coefficient is C(m_j+1 + n_j, m_j).

Wait, but m_j+1 + n_j = m_j+1 + (b-j-1) = ?

But the important part is that the sum over k for a particular j is equal to C(m_j+1 + (b-j-1), m_j).

But wait, m_j is the index of the last '(' in L that is before R[j]. So m_j+1 is the number of '('s before R[j]. Let me think: for example, if R[j] is a position in the string, and L contains all the positions of '(', then m_j is the index in L where L[m_j] is the last '(' before R[j]. Then the count of '('s before R[j] is m_j+1 (since indices in L start from 0). So m_j+1 is the number of '('s before R[j].

And (b-j-1) is the number of ')'s after j in the R list. Because R is a list of positions of ')', sorted. So for j being the index in R, the number of ')'s after j is (b-1) - j → because R has b elements (since there are b ')') and j is 0-based. So (b-1) - j → but wait, if j is the index, the elements after j are from j+1 to b-1 → count is (b-1 - j) elements. So (b-j-1) = (b-1 -j).

So the sum for a particular j is C( (m_j+1) + (b-j-1), m_j ), which is C(m_j+1 + (b-j-1), m_j).

But m_j+1 + (b-j-1) = m_j +1 + b -j -1 = m_j + b -j.

So C(m_j + b -j, m_j).

But how to compute this.

Wait, the sum over k for a particular j is C(m_j + b -j, m_j). Which is equivalent to C(m_j + (b -j), m_j) = C( (m_j + (b-j)), (b-j) ). Because C(n, k) = C(n, n-k).

So the total answer is sum_{j} C( (m_j + (b-j)), m_j ), where j ranges over all positions in R such that R[j] is after some '(' (so m_j is >=0).

So this is a big simplification! Now the problem reduces to: for each ')', find the number of '('s that are before it (m_j+1), then compute C(m_j + (b -j), m_j), and sum all these values, then subtract 1 if there's a case where k=0 (but k starts from 1, so perhaps no).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, RSBS must be non-empty. So each valid subsequence must have k >=1. But in the current sum, each j contributes C(m_j + (b-j), m_j) which is the sum for all possible k (from 1 up to the possible minimum). So the total answer is the sum over all j in R of C(m_j + (b-j), m_j) modulo 1e9+7.

Wait, but why? Because each j is a possible first ') in the RSBS, and the sum over j of C(m_j + (b-j), m_j) represents the total number of ways to choose any number of '('s before j's position and any number of ') 's after j's position, such that the total number of '('s and ') 's are equal. Wait, no. Because the sum over j sums the sum over k of C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ), which equals C(m_j+1 + (b-j-1), m_j+1-1 + (k-1) ), but according to the previous step, the sum over k for a particular j is C(m_j + b -j, m_j).

But why does this sum over j give the total number of valid RSBS subsequences?

Because each valid RSBS must have at least one '(' and one ')', and the first ') ' in the subsequence must come after the last '('. So for each ') ' in the original string, which is the first ') ' in the subsequence, the number of possible ways is C( (number of '('s before it) + (number of ') 's after it), (number of '('s before it) ). Because we can choose any number of '('s from the ones before it and any number of ') 's from the ones after it, but the total number of '('s and ') 's must be equal. So for a given j (the first ') ' in the subsequence), the number of ways is sum_{k=1}^min(m_j+1, (b-j))} C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ). Which we found is equal to C( (m_j+1) + (b-j-1) + 1, m_j+1 ). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, the sum over k for a particular j is C(m_j+1 + (b-j-1), m_j+1). Because in the earlier example, the sum over l (which is k-1) of C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l) ) = sum_{l} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l) = sum_{l'} C(m_j+1, l') * C( (b-j-1), l' -1 ), where l' = l+1. Then sum_{l'} >=1} C(m_j+1, l') * C( (b-j-1), l' -1 ), which is the same as sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 ), where s >=1. This sum is equal to C( (m_j+1) + (b-j-1) + 1, ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying Vandermonde's identity. Let me re-calculate.

The sum for a particular j is:

sum_{k=1}^t [ C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) ]

= sum_{l=0}^{t-1} [ C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

sum_{l} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l )

= sum_{l} C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l )

This can be transformed into:

sum_{l} [ C(m_j+1, l+1) * C( (b-j-1), l ) ]

Let me make a substitution s = l+1 → l = s-1. Then:

sum_{s=1} [ C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 ) ]

= sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 )

This is the same as:

sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 )

= sum_{s} [ C(m_j+1, s) ] * [ C( (b-j-1), (s-1) ) ]

But how to find this sum.

Hmm, perhaps the identity is C(m + n, k) = sum_{i} C(m, i) * C(n, k-i).

But here, the sum is sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 ), which can be written as sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), (s-1) ), which equals sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), ( (b-j-1) - (s-1) )) ) if we express it as choosing (b-j-1) - (s-1) elements.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. The generating function for C(m_j+1, s) is (1 + x)^{m_j+1}. The generating function for C( (b-j-1), s-1 ) is x * (1 + x)^{b-j-1 - (s-1)} }? Or perhaps not. Wait, sum_{s} C(n, s-1) x^{s} = x * sum_{s} C(n, s-1) x^{s-1} } = x * (1 + x)^n.

So the generating function for the sum over s is:

sum_{s} C(m_j+1, s) * C( (b-j-1), s-1 ) x^s = x * (1 + x)^{m_j+1 + (b-j-1)} } → because:

sum_{s} C(a, s) * C(b, s-1) x^s = x * sum_{s} C(a, s) * C(b, s-1) x^{s-1} }.

Let's denote t = s-1. Then:

x * sum_{t} C(a, t+1) C(b, t) x^t.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. However, perhaps there's a combinatorial identity that allows us to compute this sum.

Wait, let's look for the identity sum_{k} C(a, k) C(b, k-1) = C(a + b, a-1). Let me test this with some small values.

Example: a=2, b=3.

sum_{k} C(2, k) C(3, k-1) → k can be 1 or 2.

k=1: C(2,1)*C(3,0) = 2 *1=2.

k=2: C(2,2)*C(3,1)= 1 *3=3. Sum is 5.

C(2+3, 2-1) = C(5,1)=5. Yes, matches.

Another example: a=3, b=2.

sum for k=1: C(3,1)*C(2,0)=3*1=3.

k=2: C(3,2)*C(2,1)=3*2=6.

k=3: C(3,3)*C(2,2)=1*1=1. Sum is 3+6+1=10.

C(3+2, 3-1) = C(5, 2) =10. Correct.

So the identity holds: sum_{k} C(a, k) * C(b, k-1) = C(a + b, a-1).

So applying this identity to our case:

sum_{k} C(m_j+1, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ) = C( (m_j+1) + (b-j-1), (m_j+1) -1 ) = C( m_j + b -j, m_j ).

Yes! Because a = m_j+1, b = (b-j-1). So sum is C( a + b, a-1 ) = C( (m_j+1) + (b-j-1), (m_j+1) -1 ) = C( m_j + (b-j) ), m_j ). Because (m_j+1) + (b-j-1) = m_j + b -j.

So each j's contribution is C( m_j + (b-j), m_j ). So the total answer is the sum of C( m_j + (b-j), m_j ) for all j in R where m_j >=0 (i.e., there are '('s before R[j]).

So the steps are:

1. Preprocess the input string to collect all the positions of '(', L, and ')', R.

2. For each position j in R (0-based in R), compute m_j, which is the number of '('s before R[j]. This can be found by finding the largest index i in L where L[i] < R[j]. The number of such '('s is (i + 1). Because L is sorted in increasing order.

3. For each j in R, compute m_j as the count of '('s before R[j]. Then compute C( m_j + (b - j), m_j ), where b is the length of R (number of ') 's).

4. Sum all these values for all j in R where m_j >=1 (since k >=1 requires m_j >=1 and (b-j) >=1 ? Or does it include cases where m_j >=0? Because m_j can be zero (no '('s before R[j]), but then m_j + (b-j) choose m_j would be C( (0 + (b-j)), 0 ) = 1 if (b-j) >=0. But in that case, m_j is zero implies that there are no '('s before R[j], so the number of ways to choose k=1 would require choosing 1 '(' (but there are none), so the contribution is zero. So perhaps when m_j is zero, the term is 1, but that's invalid. Hmm, need to check.

Wait, for m_j =0 and (b-j) >=0. Then C(0 + (b-j), 0) = 1. But in this case, we're considering j as the first ') in the subsequence. The number of ways to choose k=1 is C(0,1) * C( (b-j-1), 0 ). C(0,1) is zero, so the term is zero. But according to the formula C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), this would be C( (0 + (b-j) ), 0 ) =1. Which is a contradiction. So there's a mistake here.

Ah, this indicates that the identity I applied is not correct. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's re-express the sum for j where m_j =0. In this case, there are no '('s before R[j], so m_j+1=1 (if m_j is the index of the last '(' before R[j], which is -1 if none). Wait, no. The list L contains the indices of '(' in the string. So if there are no '('s before R[j], then m_j is -1, and m_j+1=0. So m_j+1 is the number of '('s before R[j]. So for j where there are no '('s before R[j], m_j+1=0. Then the sum for k is sum_{k} C(0, k) * C( (b-j-1), k-1 ). Which is zero because C(0, k) is zero for k >=1. So the contribution is zero. But according to the formula C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), if m_j is -1 (which would be the case when there are no '('s before R[j]), then m_j + (b-j) = -1 + (b-j). But m_j is the index in L of the last '(' before R[j], which is -1 if there are no such '('s. So for j where there are no '('s before R[j], m_j+1=0.

So the formula for such j would be C( (0-1) + (b-j), 0-1 ) = C( (b-j-1), -1 ), which is zero. So the contribution for j where there are no '('s before is zero. So the formula holds.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's clarify:

- For j in R (each ')'), m_j is the index in L of the last '(' before R[j]. So m_j can be from -1 to a-1, where a is the number of '('s in the string.

- The number of '('s before R[j] is m_j +1. If m_j is -1, then there are zero '('s before.

- For j to contribute, m_j +1 >=k and (b-j-1) >=k-1 for some k >=1.

But according to the formula, the contribution is C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), which for m_j =-1 would be C( (b-j -1), -1 ), which is zero, so contributes nothing. So the formula correctly ignores j's where there are no '('s before them.

Thus, the formula C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ) correctly sums the number of valid RSBS subsequences where the first ') in the subsequence is R[j].

So the steps are:

For each ')', compute how many '('s are before it (m_j +1), and compute the combination C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), then sum all these values.

The key is now to compute this for all j in R where m_j >=0.

So the steps in code:

1. Precompute all the positions of '(' in the string. Let's call this list L.

2. Precompute all the positions of ')' in the string. Let's call this list R.

3. For each position in R, find the number of '('s before it. This is equivalent to finding the number of elements in L that are less than the current R[j].

Since L is sorted (as we process the string left to right), for each R[j], we can perform a binary search in L to find the largest index i where L[i] < R[j]. The number of '('s before R[j] is i + 1. If no such i exists (i.e., all elements in L are >= R[j], then the count is 0, and m_j = -1. So for these j's, we can skip.

4. For each j where the count of '('s before R[j] is m_j+1 >=1 (i.e., m_j >=0), compute the term C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), where b is the length of R (number of ') 's).

5. Sum all these terms modulo 1e9+7.

The main challenge is to compute the combination C(n, k) modulo 1e9+7 efficiently for n up to 4e5 (since L can be up to 2e5 elements, and R up to 2e5, so m_j + (b-j) can be up to 2e5 + 2e5 = 4e5).

So we need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 4e5.

But how?

Yes, precompute factorials up to 4e5, their modular inverses, then C(n, k) can be computed as fact[n] * inv_fact[k] * inv_fact[n-k] mod MOD.

But we need to handle cases where n <k, which would return 0.

So the steps for precomputation:

- Precompute fact and inv_fact arrays up to max_n, where max_n is up to 4e5.

Thus, the code steps are:

Read the input string.

Collect L and R lists.

If either L is empty or R is empty, output 0.

Else:

Compute for each j in R, the number of '('s before R[j] (m_j +1) via binary search in L.

For each j, compute m_j as the index found (i), then compute the term C( (i +1) + (b-j-1) -1 + 1, i+1-1 ) → Wait, wait. Let me re-express the term.

Wait, m_j is the index i in L of the last '(' before R[j]. So the number of '('s before R[j] is i+1.

But according to the formula, the term is C( m_j + (b-j), m_j ). Where m_j = i.

Because m_j is the index, and m_j + (b-j) = i + (b-j). So the combination is C( i + (b-j), i ).

But in code, for each j, the term is comb(i + (b-j), i) mod MOD.

So for j in R:

i = the largest index in L where L[i] < R[j]. If no such i exists (i.e., all L elements are >= R[j]), then skip.

Else, compute comb(i + (b - j), i), and add to the answer.

Now, the precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials is required.

The maximum possible value of i + (b-j) is (a-1) + (b-0) where a is the number of '(', which can be up to 2e5. So maximum n is 2e5 + 2e5 = 4e5.

Thus, precompute fact and inv_fact up to 4e5.

So the code outline:

MOD = 1e9+7

s = input().strip()

L = []
R = []
for idx, c in enumerate(s):
    if c == '(':
        L.append(idx)
    else:
        R.append(idx)
a = len(L)
b = len(R)
if a ==0 or b ==0:
    print(0)
    exit()

max_n = a + b
fact = [1]*(max_n+1)
for i in range(1, max_n+1):
    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD
inv_fact = [1]*(max_n+1)
inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)
for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):
    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

def comb(n, k):
    if n <0 or k <0 or n <k:
        return 0
    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n -k] % MOD

ans =0
for j in range(len(R)):
    # find the number of '(' before R[j]
    r_pos = R[j]
    # find the largest i in L where L[i] < r_pos
    # binary search
    low = 0
    high = a-1
    res = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) //2
        if L[mid] < r_pos:
            res = mid
            low = mid +1
        else:
            high = mid -1
    if res == -1:
        # no '(' before
        continue
    i = res
    # compute C(i + (b - j), i)
    n = i + (b - j)
    k = i
    term = comb(n, k)
    ans = (ans + term) % MOD
print(ans)

Wait, but why is the combination C(n, k) where n is i + (b-j) and k is i?

Yes. Because according to the formula, it's C(m_j + (b-j), m_j ), where m_j is i.

But m_j is the index in L of the last '(', which is i. So the term is C(i + (b-j), i).

Yes.

Testing this code against the examples.

First example:

Input: )(()()

The string is index 0: ')', 1: '(', 2: '(', 3: ')', 4: '(', 5: ')'

L is the positions of '(', which are [1,2,4]

R is the positions of ')', which are [0,3,5]

b is 3.

Processing each j in R:

j=0: R[j] is 0. Binary search in L for elements less than 0. Since all elements are >=0 (1,2,4), there are none. So res is -1. Skip.

j=1: R[j] is 3. Binary search in L for elements less than 3. The elements are 1,2,4. The largest i where L[i] <3 is 2 (since L[2] is 4? Wait, wait no. Wait, L is [1,2,4]. So L[0]=1, L[1]=2, L[2]=4. For R[j] =3, we look for elements less than 3. The elements 1,2 are less than 3. The largest index is 1 (L[1]=2). So i=1. So term is comb(1 + (3 -1), 1) → comb(1 +2, 1) = comb(3,1) =3. So add 3.

j=2: R[j] is5. Binary search for elements less than 5. All elements (1,2,4) are <5. The largest is i=2. So term is comb(2 + (3-2), 2) → comb(3, 2) =3. Add 3.

So total ans is 3+3=6. Which matches the first example.

Second example:

Input: ()()()

String is index 0: '(', 1: ')', 2: '(', 3: ')', 4: '(', 5: ')'

L is [0,2,4], R is [1,3,5].

For each j in R:

j=0 (R[j] is 1):

Binary search L for elements <1. L[0] is 0 <1. So i=0. term is comb(0 +3-0, 0) = comb(3,0) =1? Wait, no. Wait, j is 0, b=3. So b-j=3-0=3. So i + (b-j) =0 +3=3, k is 0. So C(3,0) is 1. So term is 1.

Wait, but according to our code, j is the index in R, which for R of size 3, j ranges 0,1,2.

For j=0, R[j] is 1. L is [0,2,4]. Binary search for elements <1: L[0]=0 is <1. The largest index is 0. So i=0.

term is comb(0 + (3 -0), 0) → 3-0 is 3, so 0+3=3. comb(3,0) is 1.

j=0 contributes 1.

j=1: R[j] is3. Find elements in L <3. L elements are 0,2,4. All elements less than3 are 0 and 2. Largest i is1 (L[1]=2). So i=1.

term is comb(1 + (3-1), 1) → comb(1+2,1) = comb(3,1)=3.

j=1 contributes 3.

j=2: R[j]=5. All elements in L are <5. i=2. term is comb(2 + (3-2), 2) → 2+1=3, comb(3,2)=3.

So sum is 1+3+3=7. Which matches the second example.

Third example: input ))).

R is [0,1,2]. L is empty. So a=0. So code outputs 0.

So the code works for the examples.

Now, the precomputation of fact and inv_fact up to max_n =a +b. For the first example, a=3, b=3 → max_n=6.

But in general, a and b can be up to 2e5 each, so max_n is up to 4e5.

But precomputing factorial up to 4e5 is feasible in Python. The code should handle that.

Possible optimizations: precompute fact and inv_fact once, with max_n up to 4e5. But in code, the maximum needed for n is i + (b-j). Since i can be up to a-1 (a up to 2e5), and b-j can be up to b (when j=0). So i + (b-j) can be up to (2e5-1) + 2e5=4e5-1. So precomputing up to 4e5 is sufficient.

Thus, the code should work.
