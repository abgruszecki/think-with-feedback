Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of good sequences of length k where each element divides the next one. And n is the maximum possible value in the sequence. Hmm.

So, for a sequence to be good, each element after the first must be a multiple of the previous. For example, in the first sample input, n=3, k=2. The valid sequences are like [1,2], [1,3], etc. The output is 5.

The constraints are n and k up to 2000. That's a manageable size. But we need to find an efficient way to compute this without checking all possible sequences, which would be way too slow.

Let me think about dynamic programming. Maybe we can model the problem with DP. Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of good sequences of length i that end with the number j. Then, the answer would be the sum of dp[k][j] for all j from 1 to n.

For the base case, when i=1, dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to n. Because a sequence of length 1 is just a single element, and any number is allowed as long as it's between 1 and n. Wait, but the initial constraints say that the sequence is non-decreasing. Wait no, the problem statement says "a sequence of l integers b1, b2, ..., bl (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bl ≤ n)". Wait, no. Wait, looking back: the problem says the sequence is good if each number divides the next. The sequence's elements are allowed to be in non-decreasing order, but the actual problem statement here allows the sequence to have elements where each divides the next, but not necessarily non-decreasing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem statement says that the sequence is a sequence of integers where 1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bl ≤ n. Wait, the actual description says that the sequence is non-decreasing. Wait, the initial problem statement says that the sequence is good if each divides the next. But the problem also says that the sequence is given as a non-decreasing sequence. Wait, no, the problem's first paragraph says that the sequence is of l integers with 1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bl ≤ n. So the sequence must be non-decreasing. But each term divides the next. So for example, [2,4] is allowed, but [4,2] is not, because the sequence is non-decreasing. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the sequence must be non-decreasing. Wait, the problem defines the sequence as satisfying 1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bl ≤ n. So the sequence is non-decreasing. But each term divides the next. So the next term must be a multiple of the current term. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, each next term is at least as big as the current. So for example, in the first sample input, the valid sequences are those where each term divides the next, and the sequence is non-decreasing. So for the sample input 3,2: the sequences are [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,2], [3,3]. Wait, but the output is 5, which matches these.

So the problem is to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length k where each term divides the next, and each term is ≤ n.

So the sequence must be non-decreasing, and each term must divide the next term.

So the DP approach is to track for each position i in the sequence (from 1 to k), and for each possible number j (from 1 to n), the number of sequences ending with j at position i.

The transitions would be: for dp[i][j], we can come from any number m that divides j, and m <= j. Wait, but since the sequence is non-decreasing, the previous term must be <= j and divides j. So for each j, the previous term can be any divisor of j that is <= j. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, the previous term must be <= j, but since each term is non-decreasing, the previous term can be any divisor of j (since divisors of j are <= j). Wait, but j is the next term, which is allowed to be >= the previous term. So the previous term is m, which divides j, and m <= j. But since m divides j, m is <= j. So the previous term can be any divisor of j. So for each j, the possible previous terms are all divisors of j.

So, for each step i, to compute dp[i][j], we sum dp[i-1][m] for all m that divide j.

The base case is i=1: dp[1][j] = 1 for all j, since each number can form a sequence of length 1 by itself.

So the answer is the sum of dp[k][j] for all j from 1 to n.

Now, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2000, and k up to 2000, the total possible states are 2000 * 2000 = 4,000,000. For each state, we need to find all divisors of j and sum the dp[i-1][m]. But for each j, finding its divisors each time could be time-consuming. So we need a way to precompute the divisors for all j up to 2000, so that for each j, we can quickly get all its divisors. Then, for each j in the DP step i, sum the dp[i-1][m] for all m in divisors of j.

Alternatively, precompute for each j the list of divisors m where m <= j (which they all are, since m divides j implies m <= j). Wait, j's divisors are all numbers m such that m divides j and m <= j. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, and the previous term must be <= the current term, the divisors of j are exactly the possible m's.

So for each j, precompute all divisors (including 1 and j), and for each step i, when calculating dp[i][j], we sum the previous dp values for all those divisors.

But how to do this efficiently? Because for each j, for each i, we need to sum over all divisors m of j the dp[i-1][m].

The key is precomputing the divisors for each j. Let's precompute for each j from 1 to n, a list of all divisors of j. Then, for each j, when processing dp[i][j], we can loop through its divisors and sum the dp[i-1][m] values.

This approach would be O(k * n * d), where d is the average number of divisors per number. For n up to 2000, the maximum number of divisors a number can have is, for example, 240 for 2520 (but 2000 is not that high). Let's see, 2000 is 2^4 * 5^3. The number of divisors is (4+1)*(3+1) = 20. So even for numbers up to 2000, the number of divisors is manageable. So for each j, the number of divisors is O(2000) at worst, but probably around 20 on average. So the total time would be 2000 * 2000 * 20 = 80 million operations. Which should be acceptable for a Python solution under 1 second.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each j from 1 to n, the list of its divisors.

2. Initialize a DP array where dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to n.

3. For each i from 2 to k:

   For each j from 1 to n:

      dp[i][j] = sum of dp[i-1][m] for all m in divisors of j.

   Then take modulo 1e9+7 at each step to prevent overflow.

4. The final answer is the sum of dp[k][j] for all j from 1 to n, modulo 1e9+7.

Now, how to precompute the divisors?

We can create a list of divisors for each j. For each j, iterate from 1 to sqrt(j), check if it divides j, and collect all divisors. Then sort them (not sure if needed, but probably not necessary). Wait, but for the DP step, the order doesn't matter, because we just need to sum all dp[i-1][m] for m in divisors of j.

Alternatively, for each j, we can generate all divisors by checking all numbers from 1 to j and see if they divide j. That's O(j) per j. For j up to 2000, this is 2000*2000 = 4 million operations, which is acceptable.

So code steps:

First, precompute divisors for all j from 1 to n.

Then, initialize the dp array. Since k can be up to 2000, and n up to 2000, a 2D array of size (k+1) x (n+1) is needed. But in Python, perhaps using a list of lists.

But in Python, space might be manageable. For 2000 x 2000, that's 4 million entries. Each is an integer. So in Python, even with 4 million integers, each taking 28 bytes (for small integers, perhaps even more), that's 112MB, which is within the memory limit (256MB).

Alternatively, since for each step i, we only need the previous step's data (i-1), we can optimize space by using two 1D arrays: previous and current. Because for computing the current i-th step, we only need the i-1-th step's values.

This would reduce the space from O(k*n) to O(n), which is better. For n=2000, that's 2000 integers per array.

Yes, this is a good optimization. So instead of a 2D array, use two 1D arrays: prev and curr.

So initial state:

prev[j] = 1 for all j from 1 to n.

Then, for each step from 2 to k:

   for each j from 1 to n:

       curr[j] = sum of prev[m] for m in divisors[j]

   then, prev = curr, and reset curr for next iteration.

Wait, but in Python, when you do assignments like prev = curr, you have to make sure that curr is a new array each time. So perhaps, in each iteration, create a new array for curr, compute it based on prev, then assign prev = curr for the next iteration.

So code steps:

n, k = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 10**9 +7

if k ==0:

    print(0)

elif k ==1:

    print(n)

else:

    # precompute divisors for each j up to n.

    divisors = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

    for j in range(1, n+1):

        for m in range(1, j+1):

            if j % m ==0:

                divisors[j].append(m)

    # initialize prev as dp[1][j] =1

    prev = [0]*(n+1)

    for j in range(1, n+1):

        prev[j] =1

    # iterate for steps from 2 to k

    for _ in range(2, k+1):

        curr = [0]*(n+1)

        for j in range(1, n+1):

            total =0

            for m in divisors[j]:

                total += prev[m]

                if total >= MOD:

                    total -= MOD

            curr[j] = total % MOD

        prev = curr

    # sum all prev[j] for j=1 to n

    result = sum(prev) % MOD

    print(result)

This approach uses O(n) space for the prev and curr arrays, and precomputes the divisors in O(n^2) time, which for n=2000 is 4 million operations—manageable.

Let me check the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input: 3 2

The divisors for each j:

j=1: [1]

j=2: [1,2]

j=3: [1,3]

For k=2.

prev starts as [0,1,1,1]

Then, for the next step (k=2), compute curr[j]:

For j=1: sum prev[m] where m divides 1. Only m=1. So curr[1] =1.

j=2: divisors are 1,2. So sum prev[1] + prev[2] =1 +1=2.

j=3: divisors 1,3. sum 1 +1 =2.

curr is [0,1,2,2]. Sum is 1+2+2=5. Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input 6 4. Output 39.

Not sure how to compute that step by step, but the code should handle it.

Another sample: input 2 1. Output is 2. Which matches, as k=1, so sum is 2.

So the code should be correct.

Now, let's think about optimizing the precomputation of divisors. For each j, instead of checking all numbers up to j, we can find the divisors more efficiently. For example, loop from 1 to sqrt(j) and collect divisors in pairs. But for j up to 2000, the initial approach is acceptable, as it's O(n^2), which is manageable.

But perhaps for j=2000, checking all 2000 numbers is slow. Let's see, in the current code, for j in 1 to n:

   for m in 1 to j:

       if j%m ==0, add to divisors[j].

So for j=2000, m loops up to 2000. For each j, the inner loop is O(j) time. So for j=2000, 2000 steps. For all j up to 2000, total steps are sum_{j=1 to 2000} j = 2000*2001/2 = 2,001,000. Which is acceptable.

But perhaps we can optimize this.

Alternative approach for divisors:

For each m from 1 to n, iterate through all multiples of m (like in sieve of Eratosthenes) and add m to the divisors of those multiples.

So for m in 1 to n:

   for j in m, 2m, 3m, ... up to n:

       divisors[j].append(m)

This way, for each m, we process all multiples j of m, and add m as a divisor of j. This is O(n log n) time, which is better.

Yes, this is more efficient. So modifying the code to precompute divisors using this approach.

So divisors = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for m in range(1, n+1):

    for j in range(m, n+1, m):

        divisors[j].append(m)

This way, for each j, the list divisors[j] contains all divisors of j. And this is O(n log n) time, which is better for n=2000. For m=1, it runs 2000 steps; for m=2, 1000 steps, etc. The total number of steps is sum_{m=1 to n} floor(n/m) ) ≈ n log n. For n=2000, this is about 2000*(log 2000) ≈ 2000 * 11 = 22,000 steps. Which is way better than the 2 million steps before. So this is a good optimization.

So changing the code to precompute divisors this way.

So the code becomes:

divisors = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for m in range(1, n+1):

    for j in range(m, n+1, m):

        divisors[j].append(m)

But wait, this will add m to all j that are multiples of m. So divisors[j] will have all divisors of j. However, since m is processed in order from 1 to n, the divisors are added in ascending order. For example, for j=6, divisors[j] will be [1,2,3,6]. But when m=1, added to 6's divisors. m=2, added to 6. m=3, added to 6. m=6, added to 6.

So divisors[j] is sorted in increasing order. But in our DP step, the order doesn't matter since we sum all of them. So this is fine.

This optimization will reduce the precomputation time significantly, which is better for larger n.

So the updated code would precompute divisors more efficiently.

Now, the code will be as follows:

n, k = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 10**9 +7

if k == 0:

    print(0)

else:

    # Precompute divisors for each j

    divisors = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

    for m in range(1, n+1):

        for j in range(m, n+1, m):

            divisors[j].append(m)

    # Initialize DP

    prev = [0] * (n+1)

    for j in range(1, n+1):

        prev[j] = 1

    # Iterate from 2 to k

    for _ in range(2, k+1):

        curr = [0] * (n+1)

        for j in range(1, n+1):

            sum_val = 0

            for m in divisors[j]:

                sum_val += prev[m]

                if sum_val >= MOD:

                    sum_val -= MOD

            curr[j] = sum_val % MOD

        prev = curr

    # Sum all prev[j] for j from 1 to n

    total = sum(prev[1:n+1]) % MOD

    print(total)

Testing sample input 1:

n=3, k=2.

divisors:

1: [1]

2: [1,2]

3: [1,3]

4: but n=3, so j up to 3.

Then, initial prev is [0,1,1,1].

Next step (k=2):

for j=1:

sum m in divisors[1] which is [1]. sum_val += prev[1] =1. curr[1] =1.

j=2: divisors [1,2]. sum prev[1] + prev[2] =1+1=2.

j=3: sum prev[1] + prev[3] =1+1=2.

curr is [0,1,2,2]. Sum is 5. Correct.

Sample 2:

n=6, k=4.

But code should handle this correctly.

Another test case: when k=1, output is sum of 1's for all j. So 2 for n=2. Correct.

Now, in Python, using list comprehensions and modulo operations efficiently.

Now, the code should be correct and optimized.
