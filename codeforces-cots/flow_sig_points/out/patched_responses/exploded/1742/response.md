Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by shifting exactly one non-empty substring. So each character in that substring is shifted once. Shifting here means replacing each letter with the previous one, with 'a' becoming 'z'.

First, I need to understand what the shift does. For example, 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'a', and so on. So the shift operation on a substring changes each character in it to the previous one in a circular manner.

The goal is to choose a substring such that after this shift, the entire string is as small as possible lex order. Lex order is dictionary order, so the first differing character determines which string is smaller.

The key is to find the optimal substring to shift. Let's think about how each possible substring's shift affects the overall string.

The approach here is to iterate through the string and find the best possible position to apply the shift. Since the substring can be of any length (as long as non-empty), we need to find the earliest possible position where shifting a substring starting there gives the smallest possible character, then proceed.

Let me think about the steps:

For each possible starting index i in the string, find the longest possible substring starting at i where each character can be shifted to contribute to the lex smallest string. But how?

Wait, the optimal choice would be to find the earliest position where shifting a substring starting there will produce the smallest possible character. Because lex order is determined by the first differing character.

So, for example, if there's a character that can be shifted to 'a' (which would require the original character to be 'b'), then shifting that single character would be better than shifting any other characters later. But wait, shifting 'b' gives 'a', which is the smallest possible. So if the original string has a 'b', shifting that would give 'a', which is better than any other shifts that don't produce 'a's.

But what if the original character is 'a'? Shifting it gives 'z', which is worse. So we need to avoid shifting 'a's unless necessary.

So the strategy is: Find the earliest position where shifting a substring (starting at i) can give the smallest possible character, and for that i, decide how long the substring should be.

So let's break it down:

1. For each position i in the string, determine the optimal substring starting at i (possibly extending to the end) that, when shifted, gives the lex smallest possible string.

2. Among all possible substrings, choose the one that makes the entire string lex smallest.

So, the first step is to find the earliest i where shifting from i onwards (for some length) gives the best possible lex order.

Let's think about the first position where shifting the character gives a lower value than the original. For example, if the original character is 'c', shifting it to 'b' would be better. If it's 'a', shifting it gives 'z', which is worse, so we don't want to shift that unless forced.

Therefore, the optimal shift would be to find the leftmost position where the character is not 'a', and shift it and possibly consecutive characters that can be shifted to produce a lower lex order.

Wait, but shifting a 'b' would turn it into 'a', which is the smallest possible. So if there's a 'b' in the string, shifting that single character would produce an 'a', which is better than any other shifts. However, if there are multiple 'b's, maybe shifting a longer substring starting with 'b' would be better.

Wait, but shifting a 'b' gives 'a', which is the best possible for that position. So if there's a 'b' in the string, the earliest occurrence of 'b' would be the best place to shift. Because shifting that 'b' to 'a' would make the entire string lex smaller than any other shifts that start later.

But what if there's a 'c' earlier than any 'b's? Then shifting the 'c' to 'b' would be better than any shifts after it, but worse than a 'b' shift. So the earliest occurrence of a character that can be shifted to a lower one is the key.

So the plan is:

- Iterate through each character in the string from left to right.

- For each position i, check if s[i] is not 'a'. Because if it's 'a', shifting it would turn it into 'z', which is worse. So we don't want to include it in the substring unless there's a later character that is better when shifted.

Wait, but maybe there's a case where even though some positions have 'a's, shifting a substring that includes them along with other characters could result in a better overall string. For example, if the original string is 'aaba', then shifting the substring from index 0 to 3 would turn it into 'z a a z' (assuming each character is shifted once). But that's probably worse than, say, shifting the substring starting at index 1 (the 'a') and including the 'b' next to it. Wait, but shifting 'a' would make it 'z', which is worse. So maybe that's not a good idea.

So perhaps the optimal substring is the earliest occurrence where a character can be shifted to a lower one. So the earliest occurrence of a character that is not 'a' (since shifting 'a' gives 'z', which is worse). So the first non-'a' character is where we need to start the substring. Then, we continue as long as shifting the characters in the substring gives a better or same lex order.

Wait, but for example, suppose the string is 'bc'. Shifting the entire string gives 'ab', which is better than shifting just the first character (which gives 'ac') or the second (which gives 'bb'). So in this case, the entire substring is better.

So the optimal substring would start at the earliest position where the character is not 'a', and then extend as far as possible where shifting the characters gives a lower or equal lex order.

Wait, but how? Let's think of the example:

Original string: 'bc'

Shifting the first character (b → a) gives 'ac' → which is lex order 'ac'.

Shifting the second character (c → b) gives 'bb' → which is 'bb' → 'ac' is better than 'bb'.

But shifting the entire substring gives 'ab' → which is better than both.

So the earliest position where the character is not 'a' is the first 'b' here. So starting at index 0, and shifting the entire substring gives the best result.

But how to determine the length of the substring to shift.

In this example, the substring is from 0 to 1. So when we shift, each character is shifted once. So 'b' → 'a', 'c' → 'b'.

So the key idea is that once we find the earliest position i where s[i] is not 'a', we should start the substring here. Then, we need to determine how far to extend this substring. The substring should include as many consecutive characters as possible where shifting them leads to a lower lex order. However, once we encounter a character that would become higher after shifting (like 'a' becomes 'z'), we should stop.

Wait, but that's not correct. For example, if the substring includes 'a', shifting it would turn into 'z', which is worse. So we definitely do not want to include any 'a's in the shifted substring. So the optimal substring should start at the earliest non-'a' character and continue until the first 'a' (excluding it) or until the end of the string, whichever comes first.

Wait, but the 'a' is already a problem. So, for example, in the string 'bcda', the earliest non-'a' is 'b'. So the substring starts at 0. Then, the next characters are 'c', 'd', 'a'. Shifting 'a' is bad, so the substring should be from 0 to 2 (the first three characters). Shifting those gives 'abc' followed by 'a', so the entire string becomes 'abca', which is better than shifting the entire substring (including the 'a') which would give 'abcz' (since 'a' becomes 'z'), which is worse.

So the substring should be from the first non-'a' character until the next 'a' (exclusive). Because once there's an 'a' in the substring, shifting it would make it 'z', which is worse. So including that 'a' in the substring is not good.

Wait, but what if the substring is after some non-'a' characters but before an 'a'? For example, in 'bcda', the substring is from 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2: 'bcd'). Shifting them gives 'abc', then 'a' remains. So the result is 'abca'. Which is better than other options.

So the rule is: once we find the first position i where s[i] is not 'a', we start the substring here. Then, we include all consecutive characters from i onwards until we hit an 'a'. Because shifting an 'a' in the substring would make it 'z', which is worse than leaving it as 'a'. So including 'a's in the substring is bad. So the substring should consist of all characters starting at i, up to but not including the first 'a' after i.

Wait, but what if after i, there are other non-'a' characters, but then some 'a's? For example, the string is 'bcaaa'. So the first non-'a' is 'b' at index 0. Then, the next characters are 'c' (non-'a'), 'a's. So the substring would be from 0 to 1 (shift 'b' and 'c' to 'a' and 'b'), resulting in 'abaaa', which is better than shifting all up to the first 'a' (which is index 2). So yes, in this case, shifting up to index 1 (the last non-'a' in the sequence) is better.

So the substring should start at the first non-'a' and include all consecutive non-'a' characters after it until the next 'a' (if any). Because once we hit an 'a' in the substring, shifting it would make it 'z', which is worse. So the optimal substring is the earliest possible non-'a' and all consecutive non-'a's after it.

Wait, but the consecutive non-'a's could be followed by other non-'a's. So for example, in the string 'bcdef', all characters are non-'a's. Then, the entire substring should be shifted. Because shifting all of them gives a string that is 'abcdef' shifted to 'zabcde'? No. Wait, no. Let's see:

Original string 'bcdef' (each character is b, c, d, e, f). Shifting each by one would result in 'abcde'. Which is lex smaller than the original. So yes, shifting the entire string is better.

So the rule is: when the entire string is made up of non-'a's, the optimal substring is the entire string.

Another example: 'abacaba'.

Original string is a, b, a, c, a, b, a.

The first non-'a' is at index 1 (the 'b'). So the substring starts here. Then, the next characters are 'a', which is 'a'—so we stop here. So the substring is just the 'b' at index 1. Shifting it to 'a' gives the string 'aaacaba', which is the sample output.

Yes, that matches the second sample.

So the approach is:

1. Find the first occurrence of a character that is not 'a'. Let's call this index i.

2. If there is no such character (the entire string is 'a's), then shifting any substring would turn it into 'z's. Since the entire string is 'a's, shifting any substring (like the entire string) would turn all into 'z's, which is lex larger. So the best option is to shift the last character (since we have to shift exactly one substring). Wait, but in this case, the entire string is 'a's. Shifting any substring (even a single 'a') would make it 'z'. So the resulting string would be all 'a's except for one 'z'. For example, if the string is 'aaaa', shifting the first character gives 'zaaa', which is worse than shifting the last character, which gives 'aaaz'. The lex smallest would be the one where the 'z' is as far to the right as possible. Because 'a' < 'z', so the earliest 'z' makes the string larger. So for all 'a's, the best possible is to shift the last character, turning it into 'z', making the lex smallest possible (since all other positions are 'a's except the last which is 'z'). So the lex smallest would be 'aa...az'.

So the algorithm must handle this case.

So the steps for the general case:

If the string is all 'a's:

- The optimal substring is the last character. Shifting it to 'z' gives the lex smallest possible (since all other positions are 'a's, and the last is 'z', which is the least possible damage).

Else:

- Find the first index i where s[i] != 'a'.

- Then, find the longest possible substring starting at i, consisting of consecutive non-'a's. Because including 'a's in the substring would make them 'z's, which is worse. So the substring should start at i and end at the last consecutive non-'a' character (i.e., until the first 'a' after i, or the end of the string).

- Shift that entire substring. Each character in it is shifted once.

This would produce the lex smallest possible string.

So the algorithm can be broken down into:

Check if all characters are 'a's.

If yes: replace the last character with 'z'.

Else:

Find the first occurrence of a non-'a' character, then find the longest possible substring starting there that consists of non-'a's. Shift all of them.

But wait, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input: codeforces → 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'c', 'e', 's'.

The first non-'a' is 'c' at index 0. All characters are non-'a's. So the entire string is shifted. So each character is shifted once. So 'c' becomes 'b', 'o' becomes 'n', etc. Which gives the output 'bncdenqbdr' as in the sample.

Yes.

Second example: 'abacaba' → the first non-'a' is at index 1 ('b'). The next character is 'a', so the substring is from index 1 to 1 (just 'b'). Shifting it to 'a' gives 'aaacaba'.

Yes.

Another test case: 'aaba' → the first non-'a' is at index 1. Then, the next character is 'a', so substring is index 1. Shifting 'a' → 'z'? Wait, no. Wait, the character at index 1 is 'a'? Wait, the original string is 'a a b a'? Or 'aaba'?

Wait, 'aaba' is a a b a. So the first non-'a' is at index 2 (character 'b'). So the substring is index 2 to 2 (just 'b'), shifting to 'a' gives 'aaa a' → 'aaaa'. Which is better than other possibilities. For example, if we shifted the substring from 2 to 3 (characters 'ba'), shifting would turn 'b'→'a', 'a'→'z', so the string becomes 'a a a z a' → 'aaaz a', which is lex larger than 'aaaaa'. So the correct approach is to shift just the 'b'.

Yes. So the algorithm works here.

Another test case: 'ba' → first non-'a' is index 0. The substring is entire string. Shifted to 'a z'. Which is 'az'. But wait, shifting 'ba' would give 'a' (from 'b') and 'z' (from 'a'), so the result is 'az' which is lex order 'az'. Alternatively, if we shift only the first character, 'b' → 'a', so the result is 'aa', which is better. Wait, that's a problem!

Wait, this shows a flaw in the algorithm.

So the original string is 'ba'. The first non-'a' is 'b' at index 0. According to the algorithm, the substring is from index 0 to 1 (since all characters after are non-'a' (the 'a' is at index 1, but according to previous logic, we stop at the first 'a'. Wait, the 'a' is in the substring. So according to the algorithm, the substring would start at 0, and include all consecutive non-'a's. But the next character is 'a', which is 'a', so the substring is just index 0. Shifting that gives 'a' and 'a' → 'aa', which is correct. So the algorithm's step is correct here.

But according to the previous example, the algorithm would select the substring starting at 0 and ending at 0 (the 'b'), shifting it to 'a', resulting in 'aa', which is better than shifting the entire substring (which includes the 'a' and turns it into 'z' → 'az').

So the algorithm works here. Because after the first non-'a' (index 0), the next character is 'a', so the substring is just index 0. Shifting it gives the best result.

So the algorithm's logic is correct.

Another example: 'ab'. The first non-'a' is index 1 (the 'b'). So the substring is index 1. Shifting it gives 'a' → 'a' (since 'b' becomes 'a'). The resulting string is 'aa', which is correct. If we shifted the entire substring (indices 0 and 1), the 'a' becomes 'z' and the 'b' becomes 'a', resulting in 'za', which is worse.

Thus, the algorithm correctly avoids including the 'a's in the substring.

So the steps for the algorithm are:

1. Check if all characters are 'a's. If so, replace the last character with 'z'.

2. Else, find the first occurrence of a non-'a' character (index i).

3. Find the longest substring starting at i where all characters are non-'a's. This is because any 'a' in the substring would be shifted to 'z', which is worse. So the substring should be from i to j, where j is the last consecutive non-'a' after i (i.e., j is the maximum index >=i such that s[k] != 'a' for all i <=k <=j).

Once that substring is determined, shift each character in it.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

First, checking if all characters are 'a's can be done by iterating through the entire string. But for a string of length up to 1e5, this is O(n), which is acceptable.

But perhaps we can optimize by breaking early. For example, loop through the string until a non-'a' is found. If after the entire loop, none found, then it's all 'a's.

Once that's determined:

If all 'a's: take the string and replace the last character with 'z'.

Else, find the first non-'a' (i). Then, from i onwards, find the maximum j where s[j] != 'a'. Because any character between i and j (inclusive) is non-'a'.

So j is the last index in the string where s[j] != 'a' and all characters from i to j are non-'a's.

Wait, no. Because after i, there may be 'a's and then non-'a's again. But according to the algorithm, the substring is from i to the first occurrence of 'a' after i. Wait, no. Because the substring should consist of all consecutive non-'a's starting at i. Because once there's an 'a' after i, including it in the substring would turn it into 'z', which is worse. So the substring should start at i and continue until the first 'a' after i, but not include that 'a'.

So for example, in 'ba', i is 0, and the next character is 'a' (index 1). So the substring is from 0 to 0.

In 'bcda', i is 0, next 'a' is at index 3. So substring is 0-2.

In 'bcd', no 'a's, substring is 0-2.

So the way to find j is:

j is the index of the last character in the string starting from i, such that all characters from i to j are non-'a's. So j is the first occurrence of 'a' after i minus 1. If there is no 'a' after i, then j is the end of the string.

So how to find j?

We can loop from i to the end of the string until we find an 'a', then j is that position minus 1. If no 'a' is found, j is the last index.

Once i and j are determined, we shift all characters from i to j.

Shifting each character once. How to do that:

For each character in the substring, subtract 1 from its ordinal value, except if it's 'a', then wrap around to 'z'. But according to the algorithm, the substring contains no 'a's. So during the selection of the substring, j is such that all characters from i to j are non-'a's. So in the substring, all characters are from 'b' to 'z'. So shifting each of them by 1 would turn 'b' into 'a', 'c' into 'b', etc.

So for each character in i..j, we can simply subtract 1 from their ASCII code. So 'b' becomes 'a', 'c' becomes 'b', etc. 'a' is not present in the substring, so no need to handle wrapping here.

Thus, the code steps are:

Read the string s.

Check if all characters are 'a's. If yes:

   The result is s[:-1] + 'z'.

Else:

   Find i, the first index where s[i] != 'a'.

   Find j, the last index >=i such that s[j] != 'a'. This can be found by scanning from i to the end until an 'a' is found. Then j is the position before that. If no 'a' found after i, j is len(s) -1.

   Then, for each character in i..j:

      shifted_char = chr(ord(c) - 1)

   The rest of the characters remain the same.

So the code can be written as follows.

But how to efficiently find j?

Once i is found, j can be found by checking from i onwards.

For example:

s = list(s) for easy manipulation.

i = 0

while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':
   i +=1

if i == len(s):  # all 'a's
   s[-1] = 'z'
else:
   j = i
   while j < len(s) and s[j] != 'a':
       j +=1
   j -=1  # because the loop breaks when s[j] is 'a' or j is len(s)
   # Now, j is the last index of the consecutive non-'a's starting at i.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Original j starts at i. Then, while j is < len(s) and s[j] != 'a', increment j. Once the loop breaks, j is the first index where s[j] is 'a', or len(s). So the substring is from i to j-1.

Wait, no. For example, if the entire string after i is non-'a's, then j increments until len(s), loop breaks. Then j is len(s), so j-1 is len(s)-1, which is correct.

If after i, there is an 'a' at position k. Then j increments until k, then breaks. So j is k. Then j-1 is k-1. So the substring is i to k-1.

So yes.

So code steps:

i = 0

while i < len(s) and s[i] == 'a':
    i +=1

if i == len(s):
    # all 'a's
    # replace last char with 'z'
    res = list(s)
    res[-1] = 'z'
else:
    # find j
    j = i
    while j < len(s) and s[j] != 'a':
        j +=1
    j -=1

    # Now, shift from i to j
    res = list(s)
    for k in range(i, j+1):
        res[k] = chr(ord(res[k]) -1)

Then, output the res as a string.

Let me test this code against the sample input.

Sample 1:

Input: codeforces → all characters are non-'a's.

So i=0. Then j increments until len(s) (no 'a's found). Then j is len(s), j-1 is 9. So shift all from 0 to 9.

Each character is shifted by 1. So 'c' becomes 'b', 'o' becomes 'n', etc. Which matches the sample output.

Sample 2:

Input: abacaba.

i starts at 0. s[0] is 'a' → i increments. i=1: s[1] is 'b' != 'a'.

Then j starts at 1. Check s[j] != 'a'. s[1] is 'b' → yes. j increments to 2. s[2] is 'a' → loop breaks. So j is 2, j-1 is 1. So shift s[1] from 'b' to 'a'. The rest remains. So the result is 'aaacaba', which matches the sample.

Another test case: 'ba' → i=0, s[0] is 'b'. j increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', loop breaks. j becomes 0. So shift s[0] → 'a', resulting in 'aa'.

Another test case: 'aaaa' → all 'a's. So replace last with 'z' → 'aaaz'.

Another test case: 'aabaaaa' → the first non-'a' is at index 2. j is 2 (since s[3] is 'a'), so shift index 2 from 'b' to 'a'. Result is 'aaaaaaa' → but wait, original string is 'aabaaaa'. After shifting index 2: 'aaa a a a' → 'aa aaaaa'? Let me see. Original is a a b a a a a. Shift the 'b' at index 2 to 'a', resulting in 'a a a a a a a' → 'aaaaaaa'? Which is the lex smallest possible.

Yes.

Another test case: 'abc'. i=0 (since 'a' is first, then 'b' comes next. Wait, no: 'a' is the first character, so i is 0. Wait, the code for i:

Wait, the code starts with i=0. Then, it loops while s[i] is 'a'. So for the string 'abc', the first 'a' is at 0. The loop increments i to 1. s[1] is 'b' != 'a' → exit loop. So i=1. Then j is found starting at 1. s[1] is 'b' → j increments. s[2] is 'c' → j increments to 3. loop breaks. j is 3, j-1 is 2. So the substring is 1-2. Shift them: 'b' → 'a', 'c' → 'b'. So the string becomes 'aab'.

But wait, what if we shift the entire substring starting at 1 (characters 'b' and 'c'), the result is 'aab' which is better than shifting just the first non-'a' (i=1) and the next non-'a's. So yes.

But what if the original string is 'aabc'? Then the first non-'a' is at i=2 (the 'b'). So substring is from 2 to 3 (since the next character is 'c', then 'a'? Wait, no: the original string is 'a a b c'. Then j starts at 2. s[2] is 'b', j increments. s[3] is 'c' → j increments. j becomes 4 (len(s) is 4), loop breaks. j-1 is 3. So shift 2-3: 'b' → 'a', 'c' → 'b'. The string becomes 'aaab', which is better.

But what about the case where the first non-'a' is followed by a mix of 'a's and non-'a's? Like 'abac'.

The first non-'a' is at i=1 (s[1] is 'b'). Then j starts at 1. The next character is 'a' (index 2). So j becomes 2, loop breaks. j-1 is 1. So shift s[1] to 'a'. Result is 'aaac'.

Which is better than any other shifts.

So the algorithm works.

Now, the code.

But to implement this efficiently in Python, especially for large strings (1e5 characters), we need to process the string as a list, since strings are immutable in Python.

The steps:

Read the string as s.

Check if all are 'a's.

If not, find i and j.

Then shift the substring from i to j.

Now, for the case where all are 'a's, we have to replace the last character with 'z'.

But in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    if all(c == 'a' for c in s):
        # replace last character with 'z'
        if len(s) == 0:
            # but the problem says non-empty string
            pass
        else:
            new_s = list(s)
            new_s[-1] = 'z'
            print(''.join(new_s), file=output_stream)
    else:
        # find i
        i = 0
        n = len(s)
        while i < n and s[i] == 'a':
            i +=1

        # Now find j
        j = i
        while j < n and s[j] != 'a':
            j +=1
        j -=1

        # Now create the result
        res = list(s)
        for k in range(i, j+1):
            res[k] = chr(ord(res[k]) -1)

        print(''.join(res), file=output_stream)

Sample 2: abacaba → i starts at 0. After the first loop, i becomes 1 (s[0] is 'a', s[1] is 'b'). Then j starts at 1. s[j] is 'b' → j increments to 2 (s[2] is 'a'). So j is 2, j-1 is 1. So shift index 1: 'b' becomes 'a'. The rest remains. So output is 'aaacaba', which matches the sample.

Another test case: 'a' → all 'a's. Output is 'z'.

Another test case: 'ba' → i=0 (not 'a'). j starts at 0. s[0] is 'b', j increments to 1. s[1] is 'a', loop breaks. j becomes 0. So shift index 0 to 'a'. Result is 'aa'.

Another test case: 'bc' → i=0. j increments to 2 (since no 'a's), j-1 is 1. Shift both 'b' and 'c' to 'a' and 'b'. Result is 'ab'.

Which is correct.

So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Now, the code's time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.

The code is efficient and uses O(n) space (for the list conversion), which is acceptable.

Thus, this is the correct solution.

```python
s = input().strip()

# Check if all characters are 'a'
all_a = True
for c in s:
    if c != 'a':
        all_a = False
        break

if all_a:
    # Replace last character with 'z'
    res = list(s)
    if res:
        res[-1] = 'z'
    print(''.join(res))
else:
    # Find the first non-'a' character
    i = 0
    n = len(s)
    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':
        i += 1
    
    # Find the end of the non-'a' substring
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] != 'a':
        j += 1
    j -= 1  # last non-'a' in the consecutive sequence
    
    # Shift characters from i to j
    res = list(s)
    for k in range(i, j + 1):
        res[k] = chr(ord(res[k]) - 1)
    
    print(''.join(res))
```
