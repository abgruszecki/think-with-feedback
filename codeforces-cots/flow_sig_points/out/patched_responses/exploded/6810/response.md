Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.

So, there are two chess pieces on the root node (node 1) of a tree. We can move them step by step, but the distance between them must never exceed d. Each piece has a sequence of nodes they need to visit (in any order) and then return to the root. We need to find the minimum number of steps required to do this.

Hmm. The key points are:

- The two pieces start at node 1.
- At each step, move either piece to a neighboring node.
- The distance between the two pieces can't exceed d at any time.
- Each piece must visit all nodes in their respective sequences (any order) and end up back at node 1.
- Find the minimum steps.

First, I need to model the problem. Since the pieces can move in any order, but the distance constraint must be maintained, the problem is about finding a path for each piece such that all their required nodes are covered, and their positions are always within d distance of each other.

But how do we model this efficiently? Especially given that n can be up to 2e5, which is quite large. So any brute-force approach is out of the question. We need an approach that runs in linear or linearithmic time.

Let me think about the required steps. Each piece needs to visit their nodes. The order in which they visit them might affect the total steps. But the problem allows visiting the nodes in any order, so we need to find the optimal order that minimizes the steps.

Wait, the problem says "pass in any order". So for each piece, the sequence of nodes can be visited in any order. But they have to return to the root at the end.

So, for each piece, the minimal path to visit all their required nodes and return to the root is the sum of the distances from the root to each node, multiplied by 2. Because for each node, you have to go from root to the node and back. But since they can be visited in any order, the optimal path is a traversal that visits all required nodes, possibly in a way that minimizes backtracking. However, the minimal possible steps for a single piece (without considering the other) would be 2*(sum of depths of the required nodes minus the depth of the deepest node). Because when you visit the deepest node, you can cover others along the path. Wait, no. The minimal path for a single piece is the sum of twice the depth of each required node minus the depth of the deepest node. Because the deepest node requires going down once and coming back once, but the others along the path would be covered.

Wait, no. For example, if a piece has to visit nodes A, B, C, which are all in a chain. The root is 1, with children 2, which has child 3, which has child 4. Suppose the required nodes are 2, 3, 4. Then the minimal path would be 1->2->3->4->3->2->1. So steps are 6 (depth of 4 is 3, so 2*3 steps). So the formula is 2*(sum of depths - max_depth) + 2*max_depth? Wait, sum of depths would be 1+2+3=6. Max depth is 3. Then 6 -3 is 3, multiplied by 2 gives 6, plus 2*3 is 6. Total 12. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the minimal steps for a single piece to visit a set of nodes and return to root is equal to twice the sum of the depths of all required nodes minus the maximum depth. Because when you go to the deepest node, you traverse all the nodes along the path once, and then return once. The other nodes can be visited on the way down or up, but their total steps would be 2*depth for each, except the deepest node which is depth*2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Another approach: The minimal steps for a single piece is the sum of the distances from each node to the root multiplied by 2, minus the maximum distance. Because when you go to the deepest node, you don't need to come back up for the other nodes. Wait, perhaps that's the case. For example, in the chain example: required nodes are 2,3,4. Sum of distances (depth) is 1+2+3=6. Multiply by 2: 12. Subtract the maximum depth (3) gives 9. But the actual steps needed are 6. So that's not matching. So my initial idea is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of 2*(depth of each required node) minus the maximum depth. Because the maximum depth's path is traversed once, but the others require going and coming back. Wait, for the chain example:

Each required node (depth 1, 2, 3). Sum 2*(1+2+3) = 12. Subtract max depth (3) gives 9. But the correct answer is 6. Hmm, no. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, the correct answer in the chain example is 6 steps. How? The path is 1->2->3->4 (depth 3) and then back to 1. So steps are 3 (down) +3 (up) = 6. So for the three nodes, each is visited once on the way down and once on the way up. So 2*(3) = 6. So the sum of depths is 1+2+3=6, but the minimal steps is 6. So perhaps the minimal steps is 2*max_depth. But then in that example, that's the case. What if the required nodes are 2 and 4? Sum of depths is 1 +3 =4. 2*3=6 steps (path 1-2-3-4-3-2-1). So steps are 6. So 2*max_depth. So in this case, the sum of depths is 4, but the steps are 6. So the formula is 2*max_depth. Because you have to go all the way to the deepest node, which is 4 (depth 3), then return. So the steps are 3*2=6.

So perhaps the minimal steps for a single piece is 2*max_depth of the required nodes. Because by visiting the deepest node first, you can collect all other nodes on the path. Wait, no. Suppose the required nodes are 2,3 (depths 1 and 2). Then the path would be 1->2->3->2->1. Steps: 2+2 =4. Which is 2*2 (max depth). So yes. So for a single piece, the minimal steps required is twice the maximum depth among all required nodes. Because all other required nodes are on the path to the deepest one, so visiting the deepest node automatically covers them. But what if some required nodes are not on the path to the deepest node?

For example, the tree is root 1, with children 2 and 3. Suppose required nodes are 2 and 3. Then, the minimal path is 1->2->1->3->1. Steps: 4. But the max depth is 1 (since all are depth 1). 2*1=2. But the required steps are 4. So in this case, the formula is incorrect. So my previous assumption is wrong.

Ah, right. So the problem is that when the required nodes are in different branches, the minimal steps are sum of twice the depths of each node. Because each has to be visited, and you have to return to the root each time. So for the example of nodes 2 and 3 (both depth 1), steps are 2*1 (to 2) + 2*1 (to 3) =4.

So the minimal steps for a single piece is the sum of 2* (depth of each required node) minus 2*(sum of the LCA's depth). Hmm, perhaps that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the minimal steps for a single piece is the sum of 2*d for each required node, where d is the depth of the node. However, if some nodes are on the same path, you can save steps. For example, if a node is on the path to a deeper node, you don't have to backtrack. So how do we model that?

This seems like the problem of finding the minimal tour that covers all required nodes and returns to the root. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the minimal path that starts and ends at the root and covers all required nodes. This is similar to the traveling salesman problem on a tree. But for trees, the minimal path is known to be 2*(sum of edge lengths in the subtree induced by the required nodes) minus the length of the longest path from the root. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

In a tree, the minimal route to visit a set of nodes and return to the root can be computed as follows:

The sum of all the edges in the minimal subtree that connects the root and all required nodes. Each edge in this subtree is traversed exactly twice (once going down, once coming back), except for the edges on the path from the root to the furthest required node. Those edges are traversed once each (since you don't come back up after reaching the furthest node). Wait, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, in the example where the required nodes are a chain (root 1, child 2, child 3, child 4), the edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. The minimal subtree is the path from root to 4. The sum of edges is 3 (each edge has length 1). The minimal path would be 1-2-3-4-3-2-1: steps 6. Which is 2*3 (sum of edges) *2 (each edge is traversed twice except the ones on the path to the furthest node). Wait, no. The sum of edges is 3. The path is 1-2 (1), 2-3 (1), 3-4 (1), then back 4-3 (1), 3-2 (1), 2-1 (1). So total 6 steps. Which is 2* sum of edges (3*2=6). So all edges are traversed twice. But that's not the case. Wait, in this path, each edge is traversed twice. So why?

Because the furthest node is 4. But the sum of edges is 3. So 2*3 is 6. So this formula seems to hold. But in the example where required nodes are 2 and 3 (depth 1 and 2), then the edges are 1-2, 2-3. Sum is 2. 2*2=4 steps, which matches. So the formula would be 2*(sum of edges in the minimal subtree). But in the case where required nodes are 2 and 3 (siblings), the minimal subtree includes edges 1-2 and 1-3. Sum of edges is 2 (each edge is length 1). So 2*2=4, which matches.

Wait, no. If required nodes are 2 and 3 (children of 1), then the minimal subtree includes both edges 1-2 and 1-3. The sum of edges is 2. So 2*2=4 steps. Which is correct. So the formula seems to work.

So the minimal steps for a single piece is twice the sum of all edges in the minimal subtree that connects all required nodes and the root. So how do we compute this sum?

The minimal subtree for the required nodes is the union of the paths from the root to each required node. So the sum of edges is the sum of the depths of each required node minus the sum of the depths of their common ancestors. Alternatively, perhaps the sum of edges in the minimal subtree is the sum of all the distinct edges in the paths from the root to each required node.

Wait, no. For example, if the required nodes are 2 and 3 (children of 1), the sum is 1 (for 1-2) +1 (for 1-3) = 2. So the sum is sum of depths of each node (1+1) = 2. But sum of depths is 2, and sum of edges is 2. So 2*2=4 steps.

In another example, if the required nodes are 3 and 4 (children of 2 and 3, respectively), then the sum of edges is 1 (1-2) +1 (2-3) +1 (3-4) =3. Steps 6.

But if the required nodes are 2 and 4 (path 1-2-3-4), then sum of edges is 3 (each edge once). So steps 6. Which is correct.

So the sum of edges in the minimal subtree is the sum of the lengths of all the edges that are part of the minimal subtree (i.e., the edges that are on the paths from the root to any required node). So how can we compute this sum?

For each node in the required set, we can find all the edges on the path from the root to the node, and take the union of these edges. The sum is the number of such edges. Since the tree is a tree, the minimal subtree is the union of all these paths.

To compute the sum of edges in the minimal subtree, we can use the concept of the "union of paths from the root to each required node". To compute this efficiently, perhaps we can mark all nodes that are in any of the paths from the root to the required nodes. Then, the sum of edges is the number of edges in the tree that are part of these paths.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, the sum is equal to the sum of the depths of all required nodes minus the sum of the depths of all the LCAs of pairs of required nodes. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the minimal subtree can be represented by the deepest node. Wait, no. For example, if required nodes are in different branches, the minimal subtree would include all the paths to each node.

So perhaps the sum of edges in the minimal subtree is the sum of the depths of the required nodes minus the sum of the depths of their common ancestors. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's an efficient way to compute the sum of edges in the minimal subtree:

The minimal subtree is the union of all paths from the root to each required node. So, for each required node, we add all edges along its path from the root. However, edges that are shared among multiple required nodes are only counted once.

So the problem reduces to finding all the edges that are on any of the paths from the root to the required nodes. The sum of their lengths (each edge is 1 in this problem) is the number of such edges.

But how do we compute this?

An efficient approach is to collect all the required nodes, and for each node, mark all the edges along the path from the node to the root. Then, count how many unique edges are marked. But for large n (up to 2e5), this could be expensive.

But we can optimize this by using a union-find (disjoint set) data structure. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, we can use a visited array where for each node, we check if any of its ancestors (including itself) are required. If a node is on the path of any required node, then all edges from the root to that node are part of the minimal subtree.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, if a required node is in a subtree, then all edges on the path from the root to that node are part of the minimal subtree.

So, the sum of edges in the minimal subtree is the number of edges in the union of all paths from the root to each required node.

To compute this, we can process each required node and mark all nodes along their path to the root. Then, the edges are those between a parent and child where at least one of the child's descendants (including itself) is required.

Alternatively, the sum can be computed as follows:

For each node in the tree, if any of its descendants (including itself) is a required node, then the edge from the node to its parent is part of the minimal subtree. So, the sum is the number of such edges.

Wait, the root has no parent, so the edges are from the child nodes. So, for each node (except root), if the node or any of its descendants is required, then the edge from the node to its parent is included in the minimal subtree.

So the sum is equal to the number of nodes (excluding root) where the subtree rooted at that node contains at least one required node.

So, for example, if the required nodes are 4 and 3 in the tree 1-2-3-4, then the minimal subtree edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So the sum is 3.

But how to compute this?

We can perform a post-order traversal of the tree, and for each node, check if any of its descendants (including itself) are required. If yes, then the edge from this node to its parent (if the node is not the root) is counted.

But since the tree is large (2e5 nodes), we need an O(n) approach.

So the plan is:

1. For each piece, collect all required nodes.

2. For each required node set (say A for piece 1 and B for piece 2), compute the sum of edges in their minimal subtree.

3. The minimal steps for each piece alone would be 2 * sum of edges (since each edge is traversed twice).

Wait, no. Because in the minimal path, each edge in the subtree is traversed exactly twice. Except maybe for the edges on the path to the deepest node. Wait, in previous examples, the sum of edges multiplied by 2 gives the correct steps. For example, in the chain case, sum of edges is 3. Steps are 6. Which is 2*3. So perhaps that's the case.

But how?

The minimal path requires that each edge in the minimal subtree is traversed exactly twice. Because when you go down to a required node, you have to come back up, except for the last node. But maybe in the case where the deepest node is the furthest, then the edges on the path to it are traversed once each (down once, up once). So sum of edges * 2.

Wait, but in the example where required nodes are in different branches, sum of edges is sum of edges of each path. For example, required nodes are 2 and 3 (children of 1). Then sum is 2 edges (1-2 and 1-3). Steps are 2*2=4. Which is correct.

So in general, the minimal steps for a single piece is 2 * (sum of edges in the minimal subtree). So this seems to hold.

So for each piece, compute the sum of edges in the minimal subtree of their required nodes, multiply by 2. Then add the two values for the total steps. But wait, this is the case when the two pieces can move independently. However, the problem requires that their distance never exceeds d. So this complicates things, because the two pieces cannot move independently. They have to coordinate their movements to stay within distance d.

So the initial approach of summing the minimal steps for each piece is incorrect. Because their movements are constrained by the distance between them.

Therefore, the problem is more complex. We need to model the movement of both pieces such that they can cover their required nodes while maintaining the distance constraint, and find the minimal steps.

This seems challenging. Let's think about possible approaches.

The problem resembles a BFS state where each state is the positions of the two pieces, along with the set of nodes each has visited. However, with n up to 2e5, this is impossible due to the state space being enormous.

So we need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the constraints. The two pieces must always be at a distance <=d. So their positions can't be too far apart. So perhaps the optimal way is to have them move in such a way that they cover their required nodes while staying within the allowed distance.

But how to model this efficiently.

Alternative approach: Since the two pieces start at the same node, and each has to visit their required nodes and return to the root, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed as the maximum of the individual steps required, plus some adjustment based on their movement.

But that's probably not accurate. For example, in the first sample input, the first piece's required nodes are 3 (depth 1). So the sum of edges is 1 (edge 1-3). So steps are 2*1=2. The second piece's required nodes are 4 (depth 2). Sum of edges is 2 (edges 1-2, 2-4). Steps are 2*2=4. Total steps 2+4=6, which matches the sample output. But this is just a coincidence. Because the two pieces can move in a way that allows their steps to be overlapped. For example, when the second piece moves to 4, the first can move to 3. But the distance between them is 2 (since 2 and 3 are connected through 1). So 1-2-4 and 1-3. The distance is 3 (path 4-2-1-3: length 3). Which exceeds d=2. So the two pieces cannot move in this way. So their movement has to be coordinated so that their distance is always <=d. Therefore, their steps can't be done independently.

But in the sample input, the sum of their individual steps is 2+4=6, which matches the output. So perhaps, in some cases, the minimal steps is indeed the sum of their individual steps, but in other cases, it's higher.

Wait, how? Because in the first sample, the second piece's movement is done first (steps 4), and then the first's (steps 2), which totals 6. But during their movement, the distance between them is maintained.

But how does that work? Let's see the first sample's solution:

Second piece moves from 1 → 2 →4 → 2 →1. So steps taken: 4 steps. During this time, the first piece is at 1. The distance between them is 0 (both at 1) until the second piece moves to 2. Then, when the second is at 4, the first is at 1. The distance is 2 (path 4-2-1: length 2). Then when the second returns to 1, they're together again. So the distance never exceeds d=2. So after that, the first piece moves to 3 and back (steps 2). So total steps 4+2=6.

So in this case, the sum of individual steps is the answer. But that's possible because the two pieces can perform their steps in sequence, with their distance not exceeding d during their movement.

So perhaps the minimal steps is the maximum of the individual steps plus the sum of the other steps. Or perhaps the sum of the two individual steps, but arranged in a way that allows them to move without violating the distance constraint.

But how can this be generalized?

Alternative idea: The minimal steps required is the sum of the steps needed for each piece to visit their nodes, provided that their paths can be arranged such that during their movement, the distance between them never exceeds d.

But when is that possible?

In the first sample, the steps can be done sequentially. So one piece moves while the other is stationary, and vice versa. But during this movement, the distance between them is controlled.

But in other cases, perhaps the two pieces have to move in a way that they are always close. So their paths have to be coordinated.

So how can we model this?

Let me think of the two pieces as moving in a way that they are always within d distance. So for each step, their positions must be such that the tree distance between them is <=d.

The problem is to find a path for each piece (starting and ending at 1) that covers all their required nodes, such that for every step in the path (when one piece moves), the distance between them remains <=d. The total steps is the sum of the lengths of the two paths.

The minimal sum of such paths.

This seems like a graph problem where each state is (a, b), the positions of the two pieces, and we need to find the minimal steps to reach (1,1) after covering all required nodes. But the state space is O(n^2), which is impossible for n=2e5.

Thus, we need a different approach.

Let's think about the required nodes for each piece.

For each piece, the minimal steps is 2 * sum of edges in their minimal subtree. Let's call this S1 for piece 1 and S2 for piece 2.

Then, the minimal total steps would be max(S1, S2) + (S1 + S2 - max(S1, S2))). Which is S1 + S2. But in the first sample, S1 is 2 (steps 2*1), S2 is 4 (steps 2*2), sum 6.

But this works for the sample, but what if the distance constraint requires more steps?

For example, in the second sample input:

The first piece's required nodes are 1,2,3,4. The minimal subtree sum is sum of edges in the path from 1 to 4, which is 3 edges (1-2, 2-3, 3-4). So sum is 3. Steps 6.

The second piece's required node is 1. So sum is 0 edges. Steps 0. But the answer is 8. So sum of steps is 6+0=6, but the sample output is 8. So the initial idea is incorrect.

So the sum of the individual steps isn't sufficient. Because the distance constraint may require additional steps.

So there's a missing component here. The movement of the two pieces must be coordinated such that the distance between them doesn't exceed d. So even if their individual steps sum to S, it's possible that the required steps are higher due to the constraint.

Thus, the problem is to find the minimal steps such that:

- Each piece's path covers their required nodes and returns to root.

- At all times, the two pieces are at distance <=d.

The key insight here is that the two pieces can move in a way that allows them to cover their required nodes while staying within d distance. The steps required would be the sum of the steps each takes, but perhaps overlapping movements can save steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the maximum between the sum of their individual steps and twice the maximum of their individual steps. But this is unclear.

Another idea: the two pieces can't move too far apart. So when one piece needs to visit a node that is far away, the other piece must also move towards that node to maintain the distance constraint. This might require additional steps.

For example, in the second sample input:

The first piece needs to visit all nodes (1-2-3-4). The minimal steps for this would be 6 (2*3). The second piece needs to visit 1, which requires 0 steps. So sum is 6. But the sample output is 8. So the distance constraint is causing additional steps.

So why is that?

In the sample explanation, the first piece moves 1→2→3 (steps 2), then the second piece moves 1→2 (step 1). Then the first piece moves 3→4→3→2→1 (steps 4), and the second moves 2→1 (step 1). Total steps: 2+1+4+1=8.

But how does this relate to the sum of the individual steps?

Ah, in this case, the first piece's steps are 6 (as per individual steps), but the actual steps are 2 (to 3) +4 (to 4 and back) =6. But during these steps, the second piece has to move to 2 and back, adding 2 steps. So total 6+2=8.

So the additional steps are required to maintain the distance.

So the problem is to find a way to move the two pieces such that when one moves far away, the other must move along with it to stay within d distance, and this may require additional steps beyond the sum of their individual steps.

So how can we model this?

The key is to find for each required node in one piece's list, how far the other piece must move to stay within distance d. Then, compute the total steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus some function of the distance between their required paths.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative approach: the two pieces can only be at most d apart. So the regions they can visit are constrained by each other's positions. For example, if one piece is at a depth of k, the other must be at a depth of at least k -d and at most k +d.

But how to model this.

Another idea: for each required node of a piece, the other piece must be able to reach a node within d distance of that node, but this may require moving further.

Alternatively, the minimal steps can be computed as the maximum between the individual steps and the sum of the steps required to move both pieces to their required nodes while maintaining the distance constraint.

But this is vague.

Let's consider the following:

The two pieces must visit their required nodes. For each required node a in A (piece 1's nodes), the other piece must be within d distance of a during the time when the first piece visits a. Similarly for each node in B.

But since the nodes can be visited in any order, perhaps the optimal strategy is to visit the deepest nodes first for both pieces, but ensuring that their positions are always within d.

Alternatively, the minimal steps would be the sum of the individual steps plus the steps required to move the two pieces to stay within distance d when their required paths are far apart.

Wait, perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the excess distance between the two required paths beyond d. For example, if the required paths are separated by a distance greater than d, then the two pieces must make up for this by moving closer.

But how to model this.

Let me think of the minimal steps as the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum of (max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d, 0). But I'm not sure.

In the first sample, max_depth1 is 1 (node 3), max_depth2 is 2 (node 4). Sum is 3. d is 2. So 3-2=1. So add 2*1=2 steps. But the sum of individual steps is 2+4=6, plus 2 gives 8. But sample output is 6. So this idea is incorrect.

Alternative idea: the maximum distance between the two pieces during their individual paths can't exceed d. For example, when one piece is at max_depth1 and the other is at max_depth2, their distance is max_depth1 + max_depth2 (if they are in different branches). So the sum of their depths must be <=d. Otherwise, the steps required to move them together would be increased.

In the first sample, max_depth1=1 (node3), max_depth2=2 (node4). The distance between them is 1 (from node3 to root) +2 (from root to node4) =3. But d is 2. So this exceeds the allowed distance. But how is this possible?

Ah, this suggests that the sample's movement must have avoided this scenario. Indeed, in the sample solution, the first piece visits node3 after the second piece has returned to node1. So when the first piece is at node3 (depth 1), the second is at node1 (depth 0). Their distance is 1 (the path from node3 to node1 is length 1). So within d=2.

But if during their movement, the two pieces are in positions that sum their depths to greater than d, then the steps would have to account for this.

So perhaps the key factor is the sum of the maximum depths of each piece's required nodes. If this sum exceeds d, then additional steps are needed.

In particular, the required steps would be the sum of the individual steps plus 2*(max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d), but only if max_depth1 + max_depth2 >d.

For example, in the first sample, max_depth1=1, max_depth2=2. Sum is 3. d=2. So 3-2=1. So additional steps would be 2*1=2. Total steps 6+2=8. But the sample output is 6. So this idea is incorrect.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows.

Each piece must visit their required nodes. The minimal steps for each is 2 * sum of edges (S1 and S2). However, the two pieces must move in such a way that their paths are compatible with the distance constraint.

The most restrictive part of their paths is when both are at their deepest required nodes. The distance between these two nodes may exceed d. So the pieces must adjust their movements to prevent this.

Thus, the minimal steps must account for this possible overlap. The idea is that if the distance between the deepest nodes of each piece is greater than d, then the two pieces can't be at their deepest nodes at the same time. Thus, they must visit their deepest nodes in separate phases, leading to additional steps.

But how to calculate this.

For example, in the second sample, the first piece's deepest node is 4 (depth 3). The second piece's deepest node is 1 (depth 0). The distance between them is 3, which is greater than d=2. So when the first piece is at 4, the second piece must be within 2 steps. So the second piece cannot stay at 1; they must move closer. This requires additional steps.

Thus, the minimal steps would be the sum of the individual steps plus twice (max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d), but only if max_depth1 + max_depth2 >d.

In the second sample, max_depth1=3, max_depth2=0. Sum is 3. d=2. 3-2=1. So additional steps is 2*1=2. The sum of individual steps is 6+0=6. 6+2=8, which matches the sample.

In the first sample, sum is 1+2=3>2. So additional steps 2*(3-2)=2. But sample output is 6=6+0. So this approach would be incorrect here.

But wait, in the first sample, the two deepest nodes are 3 and4. The distance between them is 3 (path 3-1-2-4). So their distance is 3, which exceeds d=2. So according to this logic, additional steps are needed. But the sample output doesn't add them. How is that possible?

Ah, because in the sample solution, the two pieces don't visit their deepest nodes simultaneously. The first piece moves after the second has returned. So their deepest nodes are visited at different times. Hence, the distance between them is never exceeded.

So the additional steps would only be needed if the deepest nodes are visited simultaneously. But if the pieces can visit them in sequence, then no additional steps are needed.

Thus, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between (max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d) and zero, but only if the deepest nodes are in different subtrees. Or perhaps if the distance between the two deepest nodes is more than d, then the steps must account for this.

But how to determine whether the two deepest nodes are in different branches or not.

Alternative idea: the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus 2*(max(0, max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d)) if the paths to the two deepest nodes are in different branches. Otherwise, no additional steps are needed.

But how to determine if the paths are in different branches.

For example, in the first sample, the deepest node of piece1 is 3 (child of root). The deepest node of piece2 is 4 (child of 2, which is a child of root). So their paths are in different branches. So the distance between them is 3, which exceeds d=2. So the additional steps would be 2*(3-2)=2. But sample output is 6, which does not include this. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. So this suggests that the additional steps are not always required. It depends on whether the two pieces need to visit their deepest nodes at the same time.

Thus, perhaps the minimal steps is the maximum between the sum of the individual steps and 2*(max_depth1 + max_depth2)). Or perhaps the maximum between the sum and 2*(max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d) + sum.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the minimal steps as the sum of the individual steps plus the number of steps required to "synchronize" the two pieces. For example, if the two pieces have to visit their deepest nodes, but the distance between those nodes exceeds d, then one of them has to wait while the other moves, leading to extra steps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between 0 and (max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d).

Let's test this idea on the samples.

First sample:

max_depth1=1, max_depth2=2. Sum=3. d=2. 3-2=1. So additional steps is 2*1=2. Sum of individual steps is 2+4=6. 6+2=8. But the sample output is 6. So this is incorrect.

Second sample:

max_depth1=3, max_depth2=0. Sum=3. d=2. 3-2=1. 2*1=2. Sum of steps 6+0=6. Total 6+2=8. Which matches.

Thus, this approach works for the second sample, but not for the first. So what's the difference?

Ah, because in the first sample, the two pieces can visit their deepest nodes in sequence, thus not requiring the distance between them to exceed d. So the additional steps are not needed.

So the formula is only applicable when the two pieces must visit their deepest nodes simultaneously, which is not always the case.

Thus, the problem requires finding a way to visit all required nodes for both pieces, such that during their movements, the distance between them never exceeds d, and find the minimal steps.

Another approach is to realize that the two pieces must always be within a distance d. Therefore, their combined movement can be modeled as a region in the tree that both can reach. The minimal steps required would be the sum of their individual steps plus any steps required to ensure their paths are within this region.

But again, this is vague.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample solutions: the two pieces can move in phases. For example, one piece moves to cover its required nodes while the other stays within the allowed distance. Then, the other piece moves while the first stays or moves in a way that maintains the distance.

This suggests that the minimal steps can be the maximum of the two individual steps, but only if the regions they need to cover are within d distance of each other.

Alternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps minus the overlapping steps that can be done while maintaining the distance constraint.

But I'm not sure.

Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal steps required is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between 0, (max_depth1 + max_depth2 -d). But how to confirm this.

Let's test this:

Sample 1: sum steps 2+4=6. max_depth1 + max_depth2 =3. 3-2=1. 6+2*1=8. But sample output is 6. So this is incorrect.

Sample 2: 6+0 +2*1=8. Which matches.

Another example: if max_depth1=3, max_depth2=3, d=5. Then sum steps would be 6+6=12. max_depth sum 6, which is <=5. So no additional steps. Total 12. But if the two deepest nodes are in different branches, their distance is 6. So during the time when both are at their deepest nodes, the distance is 6>5, which is invalid. So the formula would give 12 steps, but the actual steps would require additional steps. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the previous idea is not correct.

Alternative approach:

The minimal steps must account for the fact that when the two pieces are at their deepest nodes (the ones that require the most steps), their distance must be <=d. If their distance is greater than d, then one of the pieces can't reach its deepest node while the other is at its deepest. So they have to make additional moves to compensate.

Thus, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum(0, (max_depth1 + max_depth2) -d). Because the two pieces would have to move back and forth to allow one to reach their deepest node while the other is within d.

For example, in the second sample:

max_depth1=3, max_depth2=0. Sum is 3. d=2. So (3-2)=1. Additional steps is 2*1=2. Sum steps 6+0+2=8.

Sample output is 8.

In the first sample, sum is 3. d=2. 3-2=1. Sum steps 6+2=8. But sample output is 6. So this approach is incorrect.

But why? Because in the first sample, the two pieces can visit their deepest nodes in sequence, thus avoiding the distance constraint. So the additional steps are not needed.

So the formula only applies when the two pieces must visit their deepest nodes simultaneously. But how can we determine whether that's required?

Perhaps the required steps depend on the distance between the two deepest nodes. If that distance is <=d, then no additional steps are needed. Otherwise, additional steps are required.

Thus, the formula is: sum of individual steps + 2 * max(0, (distance between deepest nodes of each piece) -d).

But then how do we compute the distance between the two deepest nodes.

Wait, the deepest nodes are the ones furthest from the root in each piece's required list. Let's call them a and b.

Then, the distance between a and b is depth[a] + depth[b] - 2*depth(lca(a, b)).

If this distance exceeds d, then the two pieces can't be at a and b at the same time. So during their movement, they must not be at these nodes simultaneously. So the minimal steps would be the sum of the individual steps plus twice (distance(a, b) -d).

But in the first sample, a is 3, b is 4. Their distance is 3 (path 3-1-2-4). So 3>2. So additional steps would be 2*(3-2)=2. Sum steps is 6+2=8, but sample output is 6. So this is also incorrect.

So this suggests that the formula is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the maximum between the sum of the individual steps and the sum of the individual steps plus 2*(distance(a,b) -d), but only if distance(a,b) >d.

But in the first sample, the sum is 6, and 6+2=8, but the sample output is 6. So this is not correct.

Hmm. This indicates that the additional steps are not always required, but only when certain conditions are met.

Another approach is to consider that the two pieces can visit their required nodes in any order, and the order can be chosen such that the distance between the deepest nodes is never an issue.

For example, in the first sample, the second piece visits its required nodes first, then the first. So during the time when the second piece is at its deepest (4), the first is at 1. Their distance is 2 (path 4-2-1), which is equal to d. Then, after the second piece returns to 1, the first moves to 3 and back. So no distance constraints are violated.

Thus, the order of visiting the nodes can avoid the need for additional steps.

So the key is to find an order of visiting the nodes for each piece such that whenever one is at a deep node, the other is in a position that keeps their distance within d.

Thus, the minimal steps would be the sum of the individual steps, but only if there exists an order where the two deepest nodes are visited in a way that their distance is <=d during their respective visits.

Otherwise, additional steps are required.

But how to model this.

This is getting very complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of the individual steps, and then check if the distance between the deepest nodes of each piece is <=d. If yes, then the sum is the answer. Otherwise, add twice the difference.

But how to verify this.

In the first sample, the distance between the deepest nodes is 3>2. But the answer is 6. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, this suggests that the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample explanations:

The minimal steps is the maximum between the sum of the individual steps and twice the maximum depth of any required node for either piece.

In the first sample, the maximum depth is 2 (node4). Twice that is 4. The sum of individual steps is 6. So max is 6. Which matches the sample.

In the second sample, the maximum depth is 3 (node4). Twice that is 6. Sum of steps is 6. But sample output is 8. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, this is not the right approach.

Alternative idea: since the two pieces must return to the root after visiting their nodes, perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps, but in some cases, the two pieces must move together, which may require doubling certain parts of the path.

Alternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between 0 and (max_depth1 - (d - max_depth2)), 0 and (max_depth2 - (d - max_depth1)).

But I'm not sure.

For example, in the first sample:

max_depth1=1, max_depth2=2.

max_depth1 + (d - max_depth2) =1 + (2-2) =1. So 1-1=0. So no additional steps.

So sum steps is 6.

In the second sample:

max_depth1=3, max_depth2=0.

max_depth1 - (d - max_depth2) =3 - (2-0)=3-2=1>0. So additional steps 2*1=2. Sum 6+0+2=8.

Which matches the sample.

Another example: if max_depth1=3, max_depth2=3, d=5. Then the distance between them is 3+3 - 2*lca_depth. If the lca is root (depth 0), the distance is 6. Which is >5. So additional steps 2*(6-5)=2. Sum steps is 3*2 +3*2=12. Plus 2 gives 14.

But perhaps in this case, the pieces can visit their deepest nodes in sequence, thus avoiding the additional steps.

Thus, this approach may not be correct.

This suggests that the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between (max_depth1 - (d - max_depth2)) and (max_depth2 - (d - max_depth1)), but only if these values are positive.

Let's formalize this:

Let a be the maximal depth of piece 1's required nodes.

Let b be the maximal depth of piece 2's required nodes.

If a + b >d, then the two pieces cannot be at their respective maximal depths at the same time. So, one piece must move back towards the root while the other moves to its maximal depth. The additional steps required would be 2*(a + b -d). Because one piece has to move (a +b -d) steps away, then back, leading to 2*(a +b -d) steps.

Thus, the minimal steps is S1 + S2 + 2*(a +b -d) if a +b >d.

Otherwise, it's S1 + S2.

Let's test this:

First sample: a=1, b=2. a +b=3>2. So steps are 2+4 +2*(3-2) =6+2=8. But sample output is 6. So this approach is incorrect.

But in the first sample, the two pieces don't visit their maximal depths at the same time. So the additional steps are not needed. So the formula is not universally applicable.

Thus, this suggests that the formula only applies when the two pieces' maximal depths are in different branches. If their maximal depths are in the same path, then the distance between them is the difference in depths, which is a -b (assuming a >=b). So if a -b <=d, then no additional steps are needed. But if a +b (their sum) exceeds d, then this is only a problem if they are in different branches.

So the correct formula depends on whether the two maximal depths are in the same path.

Thus, the steps would be:

S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, (a +b -d)) if the paths to the two maximal depths are in different branches.

Otherwise, the steps are S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, (a - (d +b))) if they are in the same path.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct formula is S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, a +b -d - 2*c), where c is the depth of the LCA of the two maximal nodes.

But this is getting very complicated.

Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the distance between the two maximal nodes (a and b). Let this distance be dist. If dist >d, then the two pieces can't be at a and b at the same time, so they must visit them in sequence. This would require additional steps of 2*(dist -d). But how.

In the first sample, dist between 3 and 4 is 3. d=2. So 3-2=1. Additional steps 2*1=2. Sum steps 6+2=8. But sample output is 6. So this is not correct.

But in the sample, the two pieces don't visit a and b at the same time. So the distance between them is not violated. Thus, the formula is incorrect.

Thus, the crux of the problem is to find the minimal steps when the two pieces' paths are arranged such that their positions are always within d. But how to model this.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of the individual steps and add twice the maximum between 0 and (a +b -d). This is the approach taken in some other problems, where the sum is adjusted based on the maximum possible distance between the two pieces.

But then, in the first sample, this approach would give 6+2=8, but the sample output is 6. So why is this discrepancy?

Because in the first sample, the two pieces' maximal nodes are visited in sequence. So during the time when one is at their maximal node, the other is at the root. So the distance is a or b, which is within d.

But how to determine whether this is possible.

Thus, the formula would be: steps = S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, (a +b) -d) - 2*min(a, b).

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the formula is steps = S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, (a +b) -d) if the two maximal nodes are in different branches. Otherwise, steps = S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, (a -b) -d).

But how to determine if they are in different branches.

Thus, the correct approach is:

Calculate a and b (max depths for each piece's required nodes).

Calculate the distance between the two maximal nodes.

If the distance >d, then additional steps are needed. The additional steps are 2*(distance -d).

But the distance between the two maximal nodes is depth[a] + depth[b] - 2*LCA_depth.

Thus, steps = S1 + S2 + 2 * max(0, (depth[a] + depth[b] - 2*LCA_depth) -d).

But how to compute this.

In the first sample:

a is node3, depth1. b is node4, depth2. LCA of 3 and 4 is 1. So distance is 1+2 - 0*2 =3. 3-2=1. So steps 6+2=8. But sample output is 6.

Thus, this approach is incorrect.

But why? Because the two pieces can visit their nodes in sequence, thus avoiding the distance constraint.

Thus, the formula adds steps that are not required.

So this suggests that the additional steps are only needed when the two maximal nodes are visited in a way that their paths overlap. Otherwise, the steps are not needed.

This is getting too complicated, and I'm running out of time.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of the individual steps and add twice the maximum between 0 and (a +b -d). Then, see if this matches the samples.

Sample1:

sum steps=6. a=1, b=2. a+b=3>2. 3-2=1. 6+2=8. Sample output is 6. So discrepancy.

Sample2:

sum steps=6. a=3, b=0. a+b=3>2. 3-2=1. 6+2=8. Which matches.

Thus, the formula works for sample2 but not sample1.

Thus, perhaps the formula is correct only when the two maximal nodes are in different branches. Otherwise, it's not needed.

But how to determine if they are in different branches.

In sample1, the two maximal nodes are in different branches (3 is child of 1,4 is child of 2, which is child of 1). Thus, their distance is 3. So why is the sample answer 6?

Because the two pieces can visit their nodes in sequence. So when one is at its maximal node, the other is at the root. So the distance is 2 for sample1's second piece at 4 and first at 1. So the distance is 2 (path from 4 to 1 is 4-2-1, length 2), which is <=d=2. So no additional steps are needed.

Thus, the formula adds steps when it's not needed.

This suggests that the additional steps are only required when the two pieces must visit their maximal nodes during overlapping periods.

But how to model this.

The key insight is that if the two maximal nodes are in different branches and their distance is greater than d, then the two pieces cannot be at their maximal nodes at the same time. Hence, one piece must visit its maximal node first, then the other. But during this, the other piece must stay close enough.

Thus, the additional steps are not needed because the two pieces are not required to be at their maximal nodes simultaneously.

Thus, the formula is incorrect.

Thus, the problem reduces to the sum of the individual steps, provided that the two maximal nodes can be visited in sequence without exceeding the distance constraint.

But how to check if this is possible.

If the distance between the two maximal nodes is <=d, then they can be visited at any time. Otherwise, they must be visited in sequence, with one piece at a time.

Thus, the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus 2*(distance between a and b -d) only if the distance between a and b is greater than d, and the two pieces are required to be at a and b simultaneously.

But since the problem allows visiting the nodes in any order, the two pieces can arrange to visit their nodes in a way that they are not at a and b at the same time.

Thus, the minimal steps is simply the sum of the individual steps.

But this is contradicted by the second sample.

In the second sample, the sum of individual steps is 6 (for the first piece) and 0 (for the second). Sum is 6. But the sample output is 8.

Thus, this approach is incorrect.

Thus, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct approach based on the problem's solution.

Upon searching for similar problems, I recall that the minimal steps required is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between 0 and (a + b - d), where a and b are the maximum depths of each piece's required nodes.

But why does this work for the second sample and not the first?

In the first sample:

a=1, b=2. a +b=3. d=2. 3-2=1. So steps=6+2*1=8. But sample output is 6. So this is not correct.

Thus, I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the two pieces can move in such a way that their paths are optimized to cover their required nodes while staying within the distance constraint. The minimal steps is the maximum between the sum of the individual steps and twice the maximum depth of all required nodes.

But sample1's maximum depth is 2, so twice is 4. Sum is 6. So max is 6. Which matches sample1.

Sample2's maximum depth is 3, twice is 6. Sum is 6. Max is6. But sample output is 8. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, I'm back to square one.

Another idea inspired by the sample explanations: the minimal steps is the sum of the individual steps plus twice the maximum between (a - (d - b)), (b - (d - a)), 0.

But how.

For sample1:

a=1, b=2. a - (d -b) =1 - (2-2) =1-0=1. b - (d -a) =2-(2-1)=2-1=1. So maximum is 1. So steps=6+2*1=8. But sample output is6.

Sample2:

a=3, b=0. a - (d -b) =3-2=1. b - (d -a) =0 - (2-3)=0 - (-1)=1. So maximum is 1. Steps=6+2*1=8. Which matches.

But sample1's output is 6, which suggests that this approach is not correct.

Thus, perhaps the correct formula is steps = S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d).

Sample1: max(1,2) -2=0. So steps=6+0=6. Sample1 is correct.

Sample2: max(3,0) -2=1. Steps=6+2*1=8. Correct.

Another example: a=3, b=3, d=5. max is3. 3-5= -2. So no additional steps. Steps=6+6=12.

But if their distance is 6, which is greater than d=5. So during their movement, they cannot be at their deepest nodes simultaneously. So additional steps would be needed. But according to the formula, no steps are added. So this would be incorrect.

But how.

But in this example, the two deepest nodes are in different branches. So the distance between them is 6. So they can't be there at the same time. Thus, they have to visit them sequentially. So the steps would be 6+6=12. But their movement would not violate the distance constraint.

Thus, the formula works in this case.

Thus, perhaps the correct formula is steps = S1 + S2 + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d).

This seems to work for the samples.

Let's test:

Sample1: max(1,2)=2. 2-2=0. So steps=6+0=6. Correct.

Sample2: max(3,0)=3. 3-2=1. steps=6+2*1=8. Correct.

Another example: a=3, b=4, d=6. max(3,4)=4. 4-6= -2. steps= S1 + S2. If their distance is 3+4=7 (if in different branches), but since max(a, b) is4 <=d=6, no additional steps. Thus, even though the distance is 7>6, the formula does not add steps. But according to the problem's constraints, the two pieces can't be at their deepest nodes at the same time. So they must visit them in sequence, and thus the distance is not violated.

Thus, the formula is correct.

Thus, the correct approach is:

Compute for each piece:

- The sum of edges in their minimal subtree (S1 and S2).

- The maximal depth of their required nodes (a and b).

Then, the minimal steps is S1*2 + S2*2 + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d).

But wait, the formula should be S1*2 + S2*2 + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d).

But in sample1, S1*2 is 2*1=2, S2*2=4. sum is 6. max(a, b) is 2. 2-2=0. So steps=6+0=6.

Sample2: S1*2=6, S2*2=0. sum is6. max(a,b)=3. 3-2=1. steps=6+2=8.

Yes, this seems to work.

Another example:

If a piece has required nodes with max depth 5, and d=3. Then max(a, b) -d =5-3=2. steps increase by 2*2=4.

But why?

Because the piece must move to a depth of5. But during this movement, the other piece must be within d=3 steps. So the other piece must move to a depth of at least 5-3=2. If the other piece's required nodes have a max depth of 0 (like sample2), then the other piece must move to a depth of 2, then back. This requires 2+2=4 steps. Thus, the formula adds 4 steps.

Thus, the formula seems to correctly model this.

Thus, the correct approach is:

For each piece, compute:

- The sum of edges in their minimal subtree (S).

- The maximal depth of their required nodes (a or b).

The total steps is (S1 * 2) + (S2 * 2) + 2 * max(0, max(a, b) -d).

But wait, how does this apply to the sample2:

Sample2: S1 is 3 (edges 1-2, 2-3,3-4). sum is 3*2=6. a=3. S2 is 0. b=0. max(a, b)=3. 3-2=1. 2*1=2. So total 6+0+2=8.

Yes.

Sample1: S1=1 (edge 1-3), S2=2 (edges 1-2, 2-4). steps 2+4=6. max(a=1, b=2)=2. 2-2=0. So no additional steps. Total 6.

Thus, the formula works.

Thus, the steps to compute the answer are:

1. For each piece, compute the sum of edges in their minimal subtree. This is the number of edges in the union of all paths from the root to each required node.

2. Compute the maximal depth of the required nodes for each piece.

3. The answer is 2*(S1 + S2) + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d).

Thus, the key insight is that if the maximal depth of either piece is greater than d, then the other piece must move at least (max_depth -d) steps towards it to stay within the distance constraint. This requires additional steps of 2*(max_depth -d).

Thus, the correct formula is:

answer = 2*(S1 + S2) + 2*max(0, max(a, b) -d)

Thus, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. For each piece, find the set of required nodes.

2. For each piece, find all nodes in the paths from the root to each required node. The sum of edges is the number of such edges.

3. Compute the maximal depth of the required nodes for each piece.

4. Compute the answer using the formula.

Thus, the problem reduces to efficiently computing S1, S2, a, and b.

Now, the task is to compute S1 and S2, which are the sum of edges in the minimal subtree of each piece's required nodes.

To compute S1 and S2 efficiently, we can use the following approach:

For each piece's required nodes, we need to find all edges in the paths from the root to each node. The sum is the number of such edges.

An efficient way to compute this is to perform a BFS/DFS from the root and mark all required nodes and their ancestors.

But for large n, this could be time-consuming.

But we can optimize this using a set of required nodes and for each node, checking if it is in the minimal subtree.

The minimal subtree for a set of required nodes is the union of all paths from the root to each node in the set.

Thus, for each node in the tree, if any of its descendants (including itself) is a required node, then this node is part of the minimal subtree.

Thus, the sum of edges is the number of nodes in the minimal subtree (excluding the root) plus the number of edges.

But wait, the sum of edges in the minimal subtree is equal to the number of nodes in the minimal subtree minus 1 (since a tree with k nodes has k-1 edges).

Thus, to compute S, we can find the number of nodes in the minimal subtree (including the root and all required nodes and their ancestors), subtract 1 to get the number of edges.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the size of the minimal subtree for each piece's required nodes.

Thus, to compute the minimal subtree size, we can:

1. Collect all required nodes for a piece.

2. For each required node, add all its ancestors (including itself) to a set.

3. The size of this set minus 1 is S.

But for large n (up to 2e5), doing this naively (for each node, traverse up to the root) would be O(m * depth), which is O(n^2) in the worst case. This is not feasible.

Thus, we need a more efficient way.

An efficient way to compute the minimal subtree's size is to use a boolean array to mark which nodes are in the minimal subtree.

Here's how:

For each required node, we traverse up the tree from the node to the root. For each node along the path, if it's not already marked, we mark it and increment a counter. Once we encounter a node that is already marked, we stop.

This way, each edge is processed exactly once.

This can be done using a parent array and a visited array.

The steps are:

Initialize a visited array of size n+1.

Initialize a counter to 0.

For each required node in the list:

- current = node

- while current is not root and current is not visited:

   - mark visited[current] = True

   - increment counter by 1

   - current = parent[current]

Thus, the sum of edges is the counter.

Wait, no. The counter is the number of nodes visited (excluding the root). Because each node is processed once. For example, if the required nodes are 4 (path 1-2-3-4), then processing 4 would mark 4,3,2, and increment counter 3. So sum of edges is 3.

Yes.

Thus, this approach is O(m), where m is the number of required nodes, as each node in their paths is processed once.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

For each piece:

   Initialize a visited array.

   Initialize count = 0.

   For each node in the required list:

      current = node

      while current is not 1 and not visited[current]:

          visited[current] = True

          count +=1

          current = parent[current]

   S = count

Thus, S is the sum of edges.

This approach is O(m) per piece, which is acceptable for m up to n (up to 2e5).

Thus, the steps are:

1. Read the tree and build the parent array.

2. For each piece, compute S (sum of edges) and a (maximal depth) using the required nodes.

3. Compute the answer as 2*(S1 + S2) + 2 * max(0, max(a1, a2) -d)

Thus, the code can be written accordingly.

Now, let's test this with the sample inputs.

Sample1:

n=4, d=2.

Tree:

1-2

1-3

2-4

First piece's required nodes are [3]. Processing 3:

current=3. parent[3]=1. Since 3 is not 1 and not visited, mark it, count +=1. current becomes 1. Loop ends. sum S1=1.

a1 is the depth of 3, which is 1.

Second piece's required nodes are [4]. Processing 4:

current=4. parent is 2. Mark 4 (count 1). current=2. Not visited. Mark (count 2). parent is 1. current=1. Loop ends. S2=2.

a2 is depth of 4, which is 2.

max(a1, a2)=2. 2-2=0. So additional steps 0.

Thus, answer is 2*(1+2) + 0 =6. Which matches.

Sample2:

n=4, d=2.

Tree:

1-2, 2-3, 3-4.

First piece's required nodes are [1,2,3,4].

Processing each node:

For 1: current is 1. parent is none. loop ends. count remains 0.

For 2: current is 2. parent is 1. not visited. mark 2. count 1. current=1.

For 3: current is 3. parent is 2. not visited. mark3. count 2. current=2 (already visited). loop ends.

For 4: current=4. parent is3. not visited. mark4. count3. current=3 (already visited). loop ends.

S1=3.

a1 is the depth of 4, which is 3.

Second piece's required nodes are [1].

Processing 1: current is 1. loop ends. count remains 0. S2=0.

a2 is 0.

max(a1, a2)=3. 3-2=1. additional steps 2.

answer is 2*(3+0) + 2*1 =6 +2=8. Which matches.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

Thus, the final approach is:

- Compute S1 and S2 using the method described.

- Compute a1 and a2 as the maximum depth of each piece's required nodes.

- The answer is 2*(S1 + S2) + 2 * max(0, max(a1, a2) -d).

Now, let's implement this in Python.

The steps for code:

Read n and d.

Read the tree edges and build adjacency lists. Then, compute the parent array and depth for each node using BFS or DFS.

Then, read the two lists of required nodes.

For each required list, compute S and a.

Then, compute the answer.

Implementing the parent and depth arrays:

We can build the tree using adjacency lists. Then, perform a BFS from root (1) to compute parent and depth for each node.

Once the parent array is built, for each required node in a piece's list, we process it by traversing up to the root and marking visited nodes (except the root) to compute S. Also, compute the maximum depth.

Thus, the code will look like this:

Read n and d.

Build adjacency list.

BFS from 1 to compute parent and depth.

Read m1 and the first list of required nodes.

For these nodes, compute S1 and a1:

   visited = [False]*(n+1)

   S1 =0

   a1 =0

   for node in list:

       a1 = max(a1, depth[node])

       current = node

       while current !=1 and not visited[current]:

           visited[current] =True

           S1 +=1

           current = parent[current]

Similarly for the second list.

Then, compute answer = 2*(S1 + S2) + 2*max(0, max(a1, a2) -d)

Output answer.

Thus, this should handle all cases.

Now, let's code this.

The BFS for parent and depth:

Initialize a queue with node 1. For each node, process its neighbors. For each neighbor, if it's not the parent, set its parent and depth.

Thus, the code for BFS:

from collections import deque

n, d = map(int, input().split())

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for _ in range(n-1):

    u, v = map(int, input().split())

    adj[u].append(v)

    adj[v].append(u)

parent = [0]*(n+1)

depth = [0]*(n+1)

q = deque([1])

parent[1] =0

while q:

    u = q.popleft()

    for v in adj[u]:

        if v != parent[u]:

            parent[v] = u

            depth[v] = depth[u] +1

            q.append(v)

Then, process the required nodes:

Read m1 and list a.

m1, *a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

Similarly for the second.

Then, compute S1 and a1:

visited = [False]*(n+1)

S1 =0

max_depth_a =0

for node in a_list:

    max_depth_a = max(max_depth_a, depth[node])

    current = node

    while current !=1 and not visited[current]:

        visited[current] = True

        S1 +=1

        current = parent[current]

Similarly for the second piece.

Then compute the answer.

Thus, the full code is:

Read the tree, compute parent and depth.

Read the required nodes for both pieces.

Compute S1, a1.

Compute S2, a2.

Answer = 2*(S1 + S2) + 2*max(0, max(a1, a2) -d)

Print(answer)

This should handle all cases.

Testing this code with the samples.

First sample:

Input:

2 4

1 3

1 4

Processing:

parent array:

node 2's parent is 1.

node3's parent is 1.

node4's parent is 2.

depth:

1:0

2:1

3:1

4:2

First piece's required nodes: [3]

max_depth_a =1.

Processing node3:

current=3. not visited. mark. S1=1. current=1. loop ends.

S1=1.

Second piece's required nodes: [4].

Processing node4:

current=4. not visited. mark. S2=1. current=2.

current=2. not visited. mark. S2=2. current=1. loop ends.

max_depth_b=2.

max(a1, a2)=2. 2-2=0.

answer=2*(1+2) +0 =6.

Which matches.

Second sample:

Input:

4 2

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 1 2 3 4

1 1

Processing:

parent array:

node2's parent is 1.

node3's parent is 2.

node4's parent is 3.

depth:

1:0

2:1

3:2

4:3

First piece's required nodes: 1,2,3,4.

Processing:

node1: current=1. loop ends.

node2: current=2. not visited. mark. S1=1. current=1.

node3: current=3. not visited. mark. S1=2. current=2 (already visited).

node4: current=4. not visited. mark. S1=3. current=3 (not visited. but processing node4, current=3 is parent=2. So when processing 4:

current=4: mark, S1 +=1 (now 1). current=3: not visited. mark, S1 +=1 (now 2). current=2: visited. So total S1=3.

max_depth_a=3.

Second piece's required nodes: [1]. Processing:

current=1. loop ends. S2=0. max_depth_b=0.

max(a1, a2)=3. 3-2=1. answer= 2*(3+0) +2*1=6+2=8.

Which matches.

Thus, the code should work.
