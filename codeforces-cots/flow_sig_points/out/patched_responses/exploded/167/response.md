Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to count the number of rectangular regions in a binary matrix (n x m) that contain at least k stars. A star is defined as a '1' pixel with four surrounding pixels (up, down, left, right) also being '1'. 

First, I need to understand how to efficiently compute the number of stars in any given submatrix. Then, for all possible rectangles, determine if their star count meets or exceeds k, and sum those counts. But considering the constraints (n and m up to 500), a brute-force approach checking every possible rectangle is definitely out of the question. That's O(n^2 m^2) which would be way too slow for 500^4 = 6.25e10 operations. So, we need a smarter approach.

Hmm. Let's think about preprocessing the grid to mark where stars are. Each star is a cell (i,j) where cell (i,j) is 1, and the four adjacent cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are also 1. So first, I can create a 2D array indicating whether each cell is a center of a star. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of rectangles (submatrices) that contain at least k stars.

Wait, but the rectangles can be of any size. The key is to compute, for every possible rectangle, the sum of stars in it, and count how many of those sums are >=k. The challenge is to compute this efficiently.

So, the plan is:

1. Preprocess the grid to find all star centers. Let's call this a star_grid, where star_grid[i][j] is 1 if (i,j) is a star center, else 0.

2. Compute the 2D prefix sum array of the star_grid. This will allow us to compute the number of stars in any rectangle in O(1) time.

3. Then, for all possible rectangles, compute their star count using the prefix sum, and check if it's >=k. But even with the prefix sum, enumerating all possible rectangles is O(n^2 m^2), which is 500^4 = 6.25e10 operations. That's way too slow.

So, that's the problem. We need a way to compute the number of rectangles with sum >=k efficiently. How can we optimize this?

Alternative approach: For each possible pair of rows (top and bottom), compute the sum of stars in each column between these rows. Then, for this row pair, the problem reduces to finding the number of contiguous column intervals where the sum of the column sums is >=k. This is similar to the subarray sum problem. For example, if we fix the top and bottom rows, then for each column j, we have a value s[j] which is the number of stars in that column between the top and bottom rows. Then, we need to find the number of subarrays (left to right) in s where the sum is >=k. 

But even this approach is O(n^2 * m) time. For n=500, n^2 is 250,000. For each of those, m=500, so total operations are 250,000 * 500 = 125,000,000, which is manageable. But 125 million operations might be tight for Python, depending on how optimized the code is. Let's see.

So, the steps would be:

- Precompute the star_grid and the prefix sum for each row (or for each column). Wait, no. Let's think:

If we fix the top and bottom rows, then for each column j, the sum of stars in that column from top to bottom is the sum of star_grid[i][j] for i from top to bottom. So, to compute these column sums efficiently for any top and bottom, we need a prefix sum array for each column. Then, for a column j, the sum between rows a and b (inclusive) is sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1].

So, first, we can precompute sum_col for each column. sum_col[j][i] is the cumulative sum of star_grid[0][j] to star_grid[i][j]. Then, for any a and b, the sum for column j between rows a and b is sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1].

Once we have these column prefix sums, for any pair of rows (a, b), we can compute for each column j the sum s_j. Then, the problem becomes, given the array s_j, how many subarrays have sum >=k? This is a classic problem, and for each such array, the number can be computed in O(m) time using a sliding window approach.

Wait, no. Wait, if we need the sum of a contiguous segment of columns (from left to right), then the sum of s_j from l to r is the sum of all stars in the rectangle from a to b (rows) and l to r (columns). We need the number of such (l, r) pairs where the sum >=k.

So, for each pair of rows (a, b), we can compute the array of s_j (each j is a column, s_j is the sum of stars in column j between a and b), then compute the number of subarrays in s_j that have sum >=k.

The key is to compute, for each (a, b), the number of subarrays in the s array with sum >=k. How to do this efficiently.

This is the same as the problem: given an array of integers (positive and non-negative), count the number of subarrays where the sum is >=k. For each such array, how quickly can we compute this?

The sliding window approach works when all elements are positive, but here, since the s_j can be zero (if a column has no stars in a row range), the sliding window approach isn't applicable. So, we need another approach.

Alternatively, we can compute the prefix sums and for each j, find the earliest i where prefix[j] - prefix[i] >=k. Since s_j can be zero, the prefix sum is non-decreasing. So, the standard approach of using a sliding window on the prefix sum array would work here.

Wait, if the s_j can be zero, then the prefix sum array is non-decreasing, since each s_j is >=0. So, for each j, the earliest i where prefix[j] - prefix[i] >=k can be found by maintaining a window start. Let's see.

The standard approach for subarray sum >=k when elements are non-negative:

Compute prefix sum array P, where P[0] =0, P[1] = s[0], P[2] = s[0]+s[1], etc. Then, for each j, we want the number of i's < j such that P[j] - P[i] >=k. Since P is non-decreasing, once we find the smallest i for a given j where P[j] - P[i] >=k, then all i's before that also satisfy the condition. So, for each j, the number of valid i's is (i_idx) where i ranges from 0 to (current i_idx -1). 

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each j, we can find the smallest i where P[j] - P[i] >=k. Then, all i's up to that i (i=0 to i_max) would also satisfy P[j] - P[i] >=k, because since P is non-decreasing, P[i] increases as i increases. So, if i_max is the smallest index where P[j] - P[i_max] >=k, then for all i <= i_max, P[j] - P[i] >=k (since i <= i_max implies P[i] <= P[i_max], so P[j] - P[i] >= P[j] - P[i_max] >=k). Wait, no. Wait, if i_max is the smallest i where P[j] - P[i] >=k, then for i < i_max, P[j] - P[i] would be >=k, because P[i] <= P[i_max] (since the prefix sums are non-decreasing). So, for example, suppose P[j] - P[i_max] >=k. Then for any i <= i_max, since P[i] <= P[i_max], subtracting P[i] from P[j] would give a larger or equal value, thus >=k. So, for each j, the number of valid i's is (i_max) (since i can be from 0 to i_max-1, but wait, the i's are the ones where i < j. So, for j, the number of valid i's is (j - i_max), assuming that i_max is the first i where the condition is met).

Wait, maybe an example will help. Let's say the prefix sums are [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]. For j=4 (sum 7), and k=4. We need all i where 7 - P[i] >=4. So P[i] <=3. The P[i] are 0, 2,3,5,7. The i's are 0,1,2. So the i's are 0,1,2. So for j=4, the count is 3. But the i_max would be the first i where 7-P[i] >=4. That's i=0 (7-0=7 >=4). So the count is j - i_max. Because all i's from i=0 to i=j-1 (since j is the end index) would be considered. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices here.

Alternatively, using a sliding window approach where we maintain a left pointer. For each right, we move the left as far as possible such that the sum (P[right] - P[left]) >=k. Since the prefix sum is non-decreasing, once we find the leftmost left for right, any left' < left would also satisfy the condition, but since the sum is non-decreasing, moving left to the right would decrease the sum. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Another approach is to use a binary search for each j. For each j, compute the prefix sum up to j, and then find the earliest i where P[j] - P[i] >=k. Since the prefix sum is non-decreasing, the possible i's are from 0 to j-1. So for each j, we can binary search the maximum i where P[i] <= P[j] -k. The number of valid i's is then j - i. Because for all i' < i, since P[i'] <= P[i], then P[j] - P[i'] >=k. So the count for j is (i) possible i's (from 0 to i-1). Wait, no. Let's see: if the earliest i where P[j] - P[i] >=k is i=3, then for i=0,1,2,3, P[j] - P[i] >=k. So the count would be i+1 (since i can be 0,1,2,3). Wait, no. For example, j is 5 (prefix sum 10), k=5. We need i such that 10 - P[i] >=5 → P[i] <=5. Suppose the prefix sums up to i=0 is 0, i=1 is 2, i=2 is 3, i=3 is 5, i=4 is 7. So for j=5, P[j] =10. So P[j] -k =5. We find the largest i where P[i] <=5. That's i=3. Then the number of valid i's is i+1 (0 to 3 inclusive), which is 4. So the count is 4. But j is 5 (since j is from 1 to m). Wait, maybe the indices here are a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the number of subarrays ending at j (right end) that satisfy the sum >=k is (current left index). Hmm, this is getting complicated. But using binary search for each j would take O(log j) time per j, which for m=500 and n^2=250,000 would be O(n^2 * m log m) → 250,000 * 500 * 10 ≈ 1.25e8 operations. That's manageable in Python, maybe.

Alternatively, can we do this in linear time per row pair?

Yes. Let's see. For a fixed row pair (a, b), we have the array s_j (the sum of stars in column j from a to b). Then, the prefix sum array is computed, and for each j, we want to find the number of i's ≤ j such that the sum from i to j is >=k.

But the sum from i to j is sum s[i...j] = P[j+1] - P[i]. So, for each j, we want the number of i's ≤ j where P[j+1] - P[i] >=k. Rearranged, P[i] <= P[j+1] -k.

So, for each j, we can compute the target value (P[j+1] -k), and find the number of prefix sums in P[0..j] that are <= this target. Since P is non-decreasing, we can use binary search for each j. For example, the prefix sum array starts with P[0] =0, P[1] = s[0], P[2] = s[0]+s[1], etc. For each j (from 0 to m-1), the current sum up to j is P[j+1]. So for each j, the target is P[j+1] -k. We need to find the number of i's (from 0 to j) where P[i] <= target.

Wait, but j here is the right end of the interval (since the sum from i to j is the sum up to j (P[j+1]) minus sum up to i (P[i])). So for each j (column index), the possible i's are 0 ≤ i ≤ j. The number of such i's where P[i] <= (P[j+1] -k) is the count for this j. So, the total number of intervals ending at j is the number of such i's. Summing this over all j gives the total number of valid intervals for the fixed row pair.

So, for each row pair (a, b), we compute the array s_j (sum of stars in column j between a and b), then compute the prefix sums P. Then, for each j in 0 to m-1, compute the target = P[j+1] -k, and find the number of i's where P[i] <= target. Sum all these counts for the row pair.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Since the prefix sums are non-decreasing, for each j, the largest i where P[i] <= target can be found using binary search. Then, the count is (i_max +1) where i_max is the largest index in P[0..j] where P[i] <= target.

For example, suppose j=3, and P is [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]. The target is 7 -k. Let's say k=3. Target is 7-3=4. The largest i where P[i] <=4 is 2 (since P[3]=5>4). So the count is 3 (i=0,1,2). So for j=3, the count is 3.

So, for each j, perform a binary search on the prefix sums up to j (the P array up to j+1). Since the P array is built as we go, for each row pair, the binary search is O(log (m)).

So for each row pair (a, b), the time is O(m log m). But since m is 500, log m is around 9, so per row pair it's 500*9=4500 operations. For 250,000 row pairs, 250,000 * 4500 = 1.125e9 operations. Which is way too much for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.

That's a problem. So this approach is O(n^2 m log m), which is 1e9 operations for n=500. That's probably not going to work in 5 seconds. Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second, so this would take around 10 seconds. So we need a more optimized approach.

Alternative Idea: For each row pair (a, b), compute the sum of each column, then compute the number of subarrays in this sum array with sum >=k using a sliding window approach. But since the sum array can have zero or positive values, the sliding window approach for sum >=k works only when the sum is non-decreasing, which it's not. So sliding window isn't directly applicable here.

Wait, but the sliding window approach for the case where the sum can have negatives is not possible. However, when all elements are non-negative, the sliding window approach can be used. Let me think again.

Wait, the array s_j consists of the sum of stars in each column between rows a and b. Each s_j can be zero or positive. So the s array is a non-negative array. Then, the standard sliding window approach for finding the number of subarrays with sum >=k can be applied.

Wait, here's how the sliding window works for non-negative elements:

Initialize left=0, current_sum=0, count=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        count += m - right  # Because all subarrays ending at right and starting from left to any point after?

        Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me refer back to the sliding window method for the problem "number of subarrays with sum >=k where all elements are non-negative".

Ah, here's the correct approach. Let me explain:

We maintain a window [left, right]. As we expand the window to the right (right increases), we add s[right] to the current_sum. Once the current_sum >=k, we can note that any window starting at left and ending at right, right+1, ..., m-1 will have sum >=k. But wait, no. Because after adding s[right], the current_sum may be >=k. Then, we need to find the leftmost left such that the sum of s[left..right] is >=k. Then, the number of subarrays ending at right is (left_max +1), where left_max is the leftmost index where the sum is >=k. Then, the count for this right is (right - left_max +1). Wait, no. Let's see:

Suppose the window is [L, R]. The sum of s[L..R] is >=k. Then, any window [L', R], where L' <= L, will have sum >=k (since s is non-negative). So, for each R, the number of valid subarrays ending at R is (L+1) (assuming L is the smallest possible index where the sum from L to R is >=k). Then, the count for R is (R - L +1) possible L's (from L to R).

Wait, perhaps an example will help. Let's say s = [1, 2, 3], k=3.

For R=0 (s[0] =1), sum is 1 <3 → no count.

For R=1 (sum 1+2=3 >=3). The smallest L is 0. So the subarrays [0..1], [1..1] sum to 3 and 2. Wait, but [1..1] is 2 <3. So this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the sliding window approach isn't directly applicable here. Because even if the sum of s[L..R] >=k, if we move L to the right, the sum might decrease but still stay >=k. But with non-negative elements, moving L to the right can only decrease the sum, but once the sum drops below k, we stop. So the idea is to find, for each R, the minimal L where the sum of s[L..R] >=k. Then, all subarrays starting from any L' <= L (but >= previous L) will have sum >=k. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, here's the correct approach for non-negative arrays:

Initialize left=0, current_sum=0, count=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        current_sum -= s[left]

        left +=1

    count += left

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps this code is for the problem where we need the number of subarrays with sum <=k. No, this is getting confusing.

Let me look up the standard approach for this problem.

The problem is to count the number of subarrays where the sum is >=k, given that all elements are non-negative.

In this case, the sliding window approach can be used. Let's think:

We can keep track of the window [start, end] where the sum is >=k. For each end, we want to find the minimal start such that sum from start to end >=k. Then, the number of possible start positions is (start_prev - start_current +1). Wait, perhaps not. Let's think:

For each end, we can find the smallest start such that sum[start..end] >=k. Then, any start' <= start will also satisfy sum[start'..end] >=k (since adding elements to the left can only increase the sum, as all elements are non-negative). But this is not correct. Wait, no. If start is the minimal start where sum[start..end] >=k, then any start' <= start would have sum[start'..end] >= sum[start..end] (since we add elements to the left). So all start' from 0 to start would be valid. But since the elements are non-negative, that's correct. So, for each end, the number of valid starts is (start +1). Because start can be 0,1,..., start. Wait, no. The start here is the minimal start such that sum[start..end] >=k. So, if we have start as 3, then sum[3..end] >=k, sum[2..end] would be even larger (since adding s[2] which is non-negative). But since start is the minimal, that implies sum[3..end] >=k, but sum[2..end] >=k, so the minimal start is 2? Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Suppose the elements are [1, 2, 3, 4], and k=5. For end=3 (sum is 1+2+3+4=10 >=5). The minimal start is 0 (sum 10 >=5). So the number of valid starts is 0,1,2,3,4 (for end=3, starts can be 0,1,2,3) → 4 starts. Which is (3-0+1) =4. So the count would be 4.

But according to the approach where we find the minimal start (0 in this case), the number of starts is 0+1 (since start is 0), which would be 1. Which is wrong. So this approach is incorrect.

Ah, here's the problem: when all elements are non-negative, the minimal start for end is the first start where the sum is >=k, but there may be multiple starts before that which would also sum >=k. So the sliding window approach for sum >=k with non-negative elements is not straightforward.

Thus, the sliding window approach may not work here, and binary search on the prefix sums is the correct way. But even with binary search, the time may be tight.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each column the prefix sums, then for each row pair (a, b), compute the sum for each column j as sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1], then compute the prefix sum array of these sums, and for each j, perform a binary search for the earliest i where prefix[j] - prefix[i] >=k. The total count for this row pair is the sum over all j of the count of such i's.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Now, let's plan the steps:

1. Preprocess the grid to mark stars.

For each cell (i,j), check if it is a '1' and all four adjacent cells are '1's. If so, mark it as a star.

But need to handle boundaries. For example, cells in the first row can't have a cell above them. So, for (i,j) to be a star center, it must have (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) all within the grid. So, only cells where 1<=i<=n-2 and 1<=j<=m-2 can be star centers. Wait, original grid is 0-based or 1-based?

The problem statement says rows and columns are numbered starting from 1. But the input is given as n lines each with m characters. So, in code, the grid is 0-based. So, for a cell (i,j) (0-based), to be a star center, it must have all four adjacent cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) within the grid and be '1's. Also, (i,j) must be '1'.

So, the code to generate star_grid would be:

for i in 0 to n-1:
    for j in 0 to m-1:
        if grid[i][j] == '1' and 
           (i>0 and grid[i-1][j] == '1') and 
           (i < n-1 and grid[i+1][j] == '1') and 
           (j>0 and grid[i][j-1] == '1') and 
           (j < m-1 and grid[i][j+1] == '1'):
            star_grid[i][j] = 1
        else:
            star_grid[i][j] =0

Wait, no. Wait, the four adjacent cells must all be '1's. So the center cell is (i,j), which must be 1, and the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) must also be 1. So for (i,j) to be a star center, all four neighbors must exist (i.e., i can't be 0 or n-1, j can't be 0 or m-1) and must be '1's, and (i,j) itself must be '1'.

So, code:

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] != '1':
            star_grid[i][j] = 0
            continue
        if i ==0 or i ==n-1:
            star_grid[i][j] =0
            continue
        if j ==0 or j ==m-1:
            star_grid[i][j] =0
            continue
        # check all four adjacent
        if grid[i-1][j] == '1' and grid[i+1][j] == '1' and grid[i][j-1] == '1' and grid[i][j+1] == '1':
            star_grid[i][j] =1
        else:
            star_grid[i][j] =0

Wait, that's not correct. Because the star is a center pixel surrounded by four side neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are '1's. So the center must be '1' and the four adjacent pixels must be '1's. However, the adjacent pixels can be at the edge of the grid. For example, if the center is at (1,1) in a 3x3 grid (0-based), then the adjacent pixels are (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2). But (1,0) is edge. So for (i,j) to be a star center, (i,j) must be '1', and (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) must exist (i.e., i must be between 1 and n-2 inclusive, j between 1 and m-2 inclusive) and be '1's.

So, the code for star_grid is:

star_grid = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] != '1':
            continue  # star_grid[i][j] remains 0
        # check if i is not in the first or last row
        if i == 0 or i == n-1:
            continue
        # check if j is not in the first or last column
        if j ==0 or j == m-1:
            continue
        # check all four neighbors
        if grid[i-1][j] == '1' and grid[i+1][j] == '1' and grid[i][j-1] == '1' and grid[i][j+1] == '1':
            star_grid[i][j] = 1

Once the star_grid is computed, the next step is to compute the prefix sums for each column. So sum_col[j] is a 1D array where sum_col[j][i] is the sum of star_grid[0][j] ... star_grid[i][j]. So sum_col[j] can be precomputed as:

sum_col = [[0]*(n) for _ in range(m)]
for j in range(m):
    current =0
    for i in range(n):
        current += star_grid[i][j]
        sum_col[j][i] = current

Then, for any row pair (a, b) (0-based), the sum for column j is sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0).

Once we have the sum for each column j, s_j, we need to compute how many subarrays of s_j have sum >=k. 

Now, the problem is, for each row pair (a, b), compute the sum for each column j (s_j), then compute the number of subarrays of s_j that sum to >=k. 

But the sliding window approach is tricky here because the s_j can be zero. So, the binary search approach for the prefix sums seems necessary. 

But with m=500 and n=500, the total number of row pairs is 500*500=250,000, and for each row pair, we need to process m columns and perform a binary search for each. So for each row pair, the processing is O(m log m), leading to 250,000 * 500 * 9 ≈ 1.125e9 operations. This is way too slow for Python.

So, we need a more optimized approach.

Alternative Idea: Precompute all possible row ranges (a, b) and for each, compute the s_j array, then compute the number of subarrays in s_j with sum >=k using a more optimized approach. Let's think of a way to compute this without binary search.

Let's consider that for each row pair (a, b), the s_j array is the sum of stars in column j between rows a and b. For the s_j array, we can compute the prefix sum array P. Then, for each j, the number of i's ≤ j where P[j+1] - P[i] >=k is the number of i's where P[i] <= P[j+1] -k. Since P is non-decreasing, the binary search can find the largest i where P[i] <= target. Then, the count is the number of such i's, which is (index +1) (since indexes start from 0). 

But even with this, the problem is the time.

Alternative Idea: Precompute the prefix sums for each possible row pair. But that's not feasible as there are 250,000 row pairs.

Alternative Idea: Instead of iterating over all possible row pairs (a, b), can we find a way to compute the total number of rectangles that include certain row ranges? Not sure.

Another Idea: Note that the sum of s_j over a range [l, r] is the same as the sum of stars in the rectangle [a, l] to [b, r]. So, the problem reduces to counting all possible rectangles (a, b, l, r) such that the sum of stars in the rectangle is >=k. 

But how to count this efficiently.

Alternative Approach: Two-Pointer Sliding Window for Columns.

Wait, for each row pair (a, b), we can compute the s_j array. Then, for this array, we can use the two-pointer approach to count the number of subarrays with sum >=k. 

But the two-pointer approach works only if the array contains non-negative numbers, which is the case here. Let's see:

Initialize left =0, current_sum=0, count=0.

For each right in 0 to m-1:

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:
        current_sum -= s[left]
        left +=1

    count += left

Wait, no. Let's see:

This code counts the number of subarrays ending at right where sum >=k. Because when current_sum is added with s[right], if after incrementing right, the sum becomes >=k, then we need to move left as far as possible to the right so that the sum remains >=k. Then, the number of valid subarrays ending at right is (left) because all subarrays starting at 0, 1, ..., left-1 would have sum >=k.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's try an example:

s = [3, 1, 1], k=3.

Processing right=0:

current_sum =3. Since >=k, subtract s[left] (3), current_sum becomes 0. left becomes 1. count += left → count +=1 (0th right, left=1).

Wait, but the valid subarrays ending at 0 are [0], sum 3. So the count should be 1. But according to this code, count += left (1), which is wrong. So this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is for the problem where you want the sum >=k and when you move left, you find the smallest left where the sum is >=k, then add (right - left +1) to the count. For example:

Initialize left=0, current_sum=0, count=0.

For right in 0 to m-1:

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        current_sum -= s[left]

        left +=1

    count += left

No, that doesn't seem right. Let's try the example:

s = [3,1,1], k=3.

Processing right=0:

current_sum =3 >=3 → enter loop.

current_sum -=3 → becomes 0. left becomes 1. exit loop.

count +=1 (left is 1). So for right=0, count increases by 1. Correct, since [0] is valid.

Processing right=1:

current_sum +=1 → sum=1.

sum <3. count += left (1). So count is 2. But no new valid subarrays. So code is wrong here.

Wait, right=1, sum is 1. So no valid subarrays ending at 1. So code adds left=1, but that's incorrect. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. So the two-pointer approach may not work here. So, perhaps the binary search approach is the only way, but it's too slow. So, what's the alternative?

Alternative Idea: Precompute all possible column ranges and use a 2D prefix sum for the stars.

But then, how to compute the number of rectangles that contain at least k stars. This is similar to the problem of counting the number of submatrices with sum >=k. 

But for this problem, there's an O(n^2 m) solution which is manageable. Let's think.

For each row pair (a, b), compute the sum for each column j (s_j) as before. Then, compute the number of subarrays in s_j that sum >=k. The total across all row pairs is the answer.

So, the crux is, for each row pair, how to compute the number of subarrays in s_j with sum >=k efficiently. 

Another Idea: Precompute the prefix sums for each row pair's s array and use a sliding window approach for the prefix sums.

Wait, the prefix sums are non-decreasing. So for each row pair, the prefix sum array P is non-decreasing. So for each j, the number of i's where P[j] - P[i] >=k is equal to the number of i's where P[i] <= P[j] -k. Since P is non-decreasing, the possible i's are up to the largest i where P[i] <= (P[j] -k). So for each j, we can keep track of the P array as we build it, and for each new P[j], perform a binary search on the existing prefix sum to find the maximum i where P[i] <= (P[j] -k). The count for j is then (i +1). 

But in Python, inserting into a list and performing binary search can be done efficiently. For each row pair (a, b), we can process each column in order, maintaining the prefix sum array, and for each new prefix sum, perform a binary search.

But since for each row pair, the s array is independent, we can process each row pair's s array in O(m) time with a prefix sum array and binary search. But how?

Let me outline the steps for a single row pair (a, b):

Initialize prefix_sum = [0]

count =0

for each j in 0 to m-1:

    current_s = sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0)

    current_total = prefix_sum[-1] + current_s

    target = current_total -k

    # find the largest index i where prefix_sum[i] <= target

    low = 0

    high = len(prefix_sum) -1

    res = -1

    while low <= high:

        mid = (low + high) //2

        if prefix_sum[mid] <= target:

            res = mid

            low = mid +1

        else:

            high = mid -1

    if res !=-1:

        count += res +1  # since indices 0..res are <= target, contributing (res+1) i's

    prefix_sum.append(current_total)

So, for each j, we append the current_total to the prefix_sum array, and perform a binary search on the existing array. The time per j is O(log (j+1)), which for m=500 is O(log 500) per j. For each row pair, it's O(m log m). 

But in Python, even this may be slow for 250,000 row pairs and 500 m. So, what's the total time?

250,000 * 500 * 10 ≈ 1.25e9 operations. Which is way beyond what Python can handle in 5 seconds (approx 1e8 operations per second). So this is not feasible.

Thus, we need to find a way to optimize this.

Alternative Idea: Precompute the prefix sum array for each column and use a sliding window approach for each row pair.

Wait, but how? For each row pair (a, b), the s_j is sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]. So for each j, s_j can be precomputed. Then, the s array for row pair (a, b) is the array of s_j for j=0 to m-1.

The problem is, for this s array, we need to find the number of subarrays with sum >=k. Let's see:

If the s array contains all non-negative values, then we can use the two-pointer approach. Because when you move the right pointer, you can move the left pointer to the right until the sum is less than k. For each right, the number of valid lefts is the number of positions between the current left and right. 

Wait, here's the correct approach for non-negative arrays:

Initialize left=0, current_sum=0, count=0.

For right in 0 to m-1:

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        count += m - right

        current_sum -= s[left]

        left +=1

No, that's not correct. Let me think of an example:

s = [3, 1, 1], k=3.

Processing right=0:

current_sum =3 >=k. So count += (3-0) → 3. But the valid subarrays are [0], [0,1], [0,1,2], which sum to 3, 4, 5. So count increases by 3. Then subtract s[0], current_sum is 0. left=1.

Processing right=1:

current_sum +=1 → 1. less than k. no action.

count remains 3.

Processing right=2:

current_sum +=1 → 2. less than k. no action.

Total count is 3. Which is correct.

Another example: s = [1, 2, 3, 4], k=5.

right=0: sum=1 <5 → no count.

right=1: sum=3 <5 → no count.

right=2: sum=6 >=5. Subtract s[0], sum becomes 5. Still >=5. So count += (3 -2) →1? Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, in this approach, when the sum is >=k, the code adds (m - right) to the count, then subtracts s[left] and increments left. But in this example:

sum after adding right=2 is 6. Then, enter the loop:

count += (4 -2) →2. (since m=4, right=2, 4-2=2. So 2 is added to count. Then subtract s[left] (s[0] =1), sum becomes 5. left becomes 1. Now sum is 5 >=k. So count += (4-2) →2 again. sum becomes 5 - s[1]=2 →3. left=2. sum is 3 <5. loop exits.

So after right=2, count is 2 + 2 =4.

Then right=3:

current_sum +=4 →3+4=7 >=5.

count += (4-3) →1. sum becomes 7- s[2]=3 →4. left=3. sum=4 <5. loop exits. count is 4+1=5.

But the actual valid subarrays are:

[0,1,2] sum 6

[0,1,2,3] sum 10

[1,2] sum5

[1,2,3] sum 8

[2,3] sum7

So total 5. So code's count is correct.

So this approach works for non-negative arrays. The code for each row pair would be:

current_sum =0

count_row =0

left =0

for right in range(m):

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        count_row += m - right

        current_sum -= s[left]

        left +=1

So for each row pair (a, b), compute the s array, then apply this sliding window approach. Since the s array can have zeros, but the elements are non-negative (sum of stars can be zero or positive), this approach is valid. 

This reduces the time per row pair from O(m log m) to O(m), which is a huge improvement. Because for each row pair, processing the s array takes O(m) time. So for n=500, n^2=250,000 row pairs, each with m=500, the total operations are 250,000 *500= 125,000,000 → which is manageable in Python.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute star_grid.

2. Precompute sum_col[j][i] for each column j, up to row i.

3. For each row pair (a, b):

    a. For each column j, compute s[j] = sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0)

    b. Apply the sliding window approach to the s array to find the number of subarrays with sum >=k.

    c. Accumulate the count into the total.

This should work within the time constraints.

Now, the key is to implement this correctly and efficiently.

Implementing the star_grid:

We need to process the input grid and mark each cell as 1 if it's a star center, else 0.

Then, compute sum_col[j][i] as the cumulative sum of star_grid[0..i][j].

Once sum_col is precomputed, for each a and b (rows), compute for each j the s[j] = sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1] (if a>0) else sum_col[j][b].

Then, process the s array with the sliding window approach.

Now, let's think about the possible ranges for a and b. a can be from 0 to n-1, and b can be from a to n-1. But in code, for each a in 0 to n-1, iterate b from a to n-1. For each (a, b), compute the s array.

But for each row pair (a, b), the code for s[j] is:

s[j] = sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0)

But wait, sum_col[j][i] is the sum up to row i. So for rows a to b (inclusive), the sum is sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]. 

Yes.

So, the code for s[j] is:

for j in 0..m-1:

    if a ==0:

        s[j] = sum_col[j][b]

    else:

        s[j] = sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]

Once we have s[j], the sliding window approach is applied.

Now, in Python, for each a and b, generating s as a list for all j's can be done with a loop. But for 500x500 row pairs and 500 columns, this would be 250,000 *500 = 125,000,000 operations. Which should be manageable.

But how to optimize this?

In Python, list comprehensions are faster than for loops. So for each j, compute s_j as sum_col[j][b] minus the a-1 term if a>0.

But how to handle sum_col. sum_col is a list of m elements, each being a list of n elements. For j in range(m), sum_col[j][i] is the sum up to row i.

So, code:

sum_col = []
for j in range(m):
    col = [0]*(n)
    current =0
    for i in range(n):
        current += star_grid[i][j]
        col[i] = current
    sum_col.append(col)

Then, for a and b, for each j:

s_j = sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0)

But in Python, this can be written as:

s = [sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a >0 else 0) for j in range(m)]

But this creates a list s of m elements. Then, process this s with the sliding window.

Now, let's test the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4 6 2

111000

111100

011011

000111

The star_grid for this case would be:

Looking at each cell (i,j):

For i=0 and i=3 (n=4, 0-based), can't be stars.

For j=0 and j=5 (m=6), can't be stars.

So only cells with i in 1 and 2, j in 1-4 can be stars.

Let's check the first row:

Original grid rows (0-based):

Row 0: '111000' → [1,1,1,0,0,0]

Row 1: '111100' → [1,1,1,1,0,0]

Row 2: '011011' → [0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 3: '000111' → [0,0,0,1,1,1]

Check cells (i=1, j=1):

Check neighbors (i=0,1) → 1, (i=2,1) →1, (i=1,0) →1, (i=1,2) →1. So yes. So star_grid[1][1] =1.

Similarly, for cell (1,2): neighbors are all 1's. So star_grid[1][2] =1.

Cell (1,3) in row 1, column 3 (0-based):

Original grid cell (1,3) is 1. Neighbors:

i-1=0 → row 0, column3 is 0. So no. So star_grid[1][3] is 0.

So the star_grid would have some stars. Let's compute sum_col for each column.

But maybe the sample output is 6. For the row pair a=0, b=2 (rows 0-2, inclusive), the sum for columns would be the number of stars in rows 0-2. So for each column j, sum_col[j][2] - sum_col[j][-1] (since a=0, a-1 is -1, which is invalid. So sum_col[j][2] for j.

But perhaps in the sample, the row pair (0,2) is part of the solution. 

But regardless, the code should correctly compute the count.

Now, to implement this code in Python.

First, read the input:

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Then, compute star_grid:

star_grid = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] != '1':
            continue
        # check if i is not 0 or n-1
        if i ==0 or i ==n-1:
            continue
        # check if j is not 0 or m-1
        if j ==0 or j ==m-1:
            continue
        # check all four neighbors
        if (grid[i-1][j] == '1' and grid[i+1][j] == '1' and 
            grid[i][j-1] == '1' and grid[i][j+1] == '1'):
            star_grid[i][j] =1

Then, compute sum_col:

sum_col = []
for j in range(m):
    col = [0]*n
    current =0
    for i in range(n):
        current += star_grid[i][j]
        col[i] = current
    sum_col.append(col)

Then, iterate all possible row pairs (a, b):

total =0

for a in range(n):
    for b in range(a, n):
        # compute s for this a, b
        s = []
        for j in range(m):
            if a ==0:
                sj = sum_col[j][b]
            else:
                sj = sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]
            s.append(sj)
        # process s with sliding window
        current_sum =0
        left =0
        count =0
        for right in range(m):
            current_sum += s[right]
            # move left as far as possible
            while current_sum >=k:
                count += m - right
                current_sum -= s[left]
                left +=1
        total += count

print(total)

But wait, this code has a nested loop for a and b. For each a and b, it loops through j to compute s. Then, for each a and b, it processes the s array with the sliding window.

But for n=500, this is 500*500=250,000 iterations. For each, it loops j from 0 to m-1 (500 iterations) and then right from 0 to m-1 (500 iterations). So 250,000 * (500 +500) = 250,000 * 1000 = 250,000,000 operations. That's 250 million operations, which is manageable in Python? Well, perhaps not. But perhaps we can optimize.

Alternative Idea: Precompute all possible a and b for each column j. Then, for each column j, precompute for all possible a and b the sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]. Then, for each row pair (a, b), the s array can be built by accessing these precomputed values. But precomputing all a and b for each j is O(n^2) per j, which is 500^3=125e6, which is feasible. But this may not save time, as the code would still require nested loops.

Another Idea: Vectorize the computation of s for each row pair. Instead of looping j in Python, perhaps use list comprehensions or generators to compute the s array more efficiently.

For example, in Python, list comprehensions are faster than for loops. So, instead of:

s = []
for j in range(m):
    if a ==0:
        sj = sum_col[j][b]
    else:
        sj = sum_col[j][b] - sum_col[j][a-1]
    s.append(sj)

We can write:

s = [ (sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a>0 else 0)) for j in range(m) ]

This may be faster.

Another optimization is to precompute for each j the sum_col[j] as a list, and then use a and b to calculate the s_j directly.

Another Idea: For each a and b, precompute all s_j using list comprehensions and then process the sliding window. But how.

Now, in the code, the nested loops are:

for a in 0 to n-1:

    for b in a to n-1:

        compute s array

        process sliding window

The code will take O(n^2 m) time. For n=500 and m=500, this is 500^2 *500 = 125,000,000 operations. But each iteration of the inner loop (processing the sliding window) is 500 steps.

But 125 million operations may be manageable in Python, given that each step is simple.

But let's test the sample input:

Sample Input 1:

4 6 2

111000

111100

011011

000111

The code should output 6.

Let's see how the code works here.

But given time constraints, perhaps the code is correct.

Potential Issues:

- Handling a=0.

- The sum_col[j][b] when a=0.

But the code seems to handle it correctly.

Another possible issue is the sliding window code. Let's re-examine:

current_sum =0

left =0

count =0

for right in range(m):

    current_sum += s[right]

    while current_sum >=k:

        count += m - right

        current_sum -= s[left]

        left +=1

The count is the number of subarrays ending at right with sum >=k, added when the sum is reduced below k. 

Wait, for example, when the current_sum is added to s[right], and the sum becomes >=k, we enter the loop. Then, the code adds (m - right) to the count. But m is the number of columns. So why (m - right)?

Because for the current right, any subarray starting at left and ending at right, right+1, ..., m-1 will have sum >=k. So for each such left, the subarray is [left, right], [left, right+1], ..., [left, m-1]. The number of such is (m - right). But this is not correct.

Wait, no. The current_sum is the sum of s[left..right], and when we find that this sum is >=k, we can't assume that extending to the right will also be >=k. Because the elements are non-negative, adding elements to the right will increase the sum, so all subarrays [left, right], [left, right+1], ..., [left, m-1] would have sum >=k. So the number of subarrays starting at left and ending anywhere from right to m-1 is (m - right). 

But after subtracting s[left], and moving left to left+1, the sum may still be >=k. So the code increments left and repeats the loop.

Thus, for each valid left, the code adds the number of subarrays starting at left and ending at right, right+1, ..., m-1. This is correct.

So the code should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

Now, let's proceed to write the Python code accordingly.

```python
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Precompute star_grid
star_grid = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] != '1':
            continue
        if i == 0 or i == n-1 or j == 0 or j == m-1:
            continue
        if (grid[i-1][j] == '1' and grid[i+1][j] == '1' and
            grid[i][j-1] == '1' and grid[i][j+1] == '1'):
            star_grid[i][j] = 1

# Precompute sum_col for each column
sum_col = []
for j in range(m):
    col = [0] * n
    current = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current += star_grid[i][j]
        col[i] = current
    sum_col.append(col)

total = 0

# Iterate over all possible row pairs (a, b)
for a in range(n):
    for b in range(a, n):
        s = [sum_col[j][b] - (sum_col[j][a-1] if a > 0 else 0) for j in range(m)]
        current_sum = 0
        left = 0
        cnt = 0
        for right in range(m):
            current_sum += s[right]
            # Move left as far as possible
            while current_sum >= k:
                cnt += m - right
                current_sum -= s[left]
                left += 1
        total += cnt

print(total)
```
