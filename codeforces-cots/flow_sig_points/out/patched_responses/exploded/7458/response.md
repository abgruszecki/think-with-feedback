Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So Bob wants to minimize the amount he pays by choosing the order of items processed by the checkout assistant. While the assistant is handling an item (which takes ti seconds), Bob can steal other items. But stealing each item takes 1 second. The key is that during the processing time of an item, Bob can steal up to (ti - 1) items. Because the first second of the assistant's time is when he starts processing the item, and in each of the next ti-1 seconds, Bob can steal one item. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that when the checkout assistant is occupied with an item (which takes ti seconds), Bob can steal. So the total time the assistant is occupied is ti seconds. During that time, Bob can steal items. For each of those ti seconds, he can steal one item. Wait, no, the problem says "to steal one item Bob needs exactly 1 second." So during the ti seconds that the assistant is busy with an item, Bob can steal up to ti items. Wait, but the way the problem is described, when the assistant is working on an item, Bob can steal others. So for each item being processed, Bob can steal some number of items equal to the time taken by that item. Because during each second of the processing, he can steal one. So for example, if an item takes 5 seconds, Bob can steal 5 items during that time. But he can't steal items while he's stealing other items. Wait, no. The processing time of the item is ti seconds. During all those ti seconds, the assistant is busy. So Bob has ti seconds to steal items. So for each item processed, Bob can steal up to ti items. But the order in which items are processed matters. Because the order determines how much time Bob has to steal items before, during, or after processing each item.

The goal is to select which items to pay for and which to steal, but the ones that are stolen are not paid for. Wait, no. The problem says that Bob has to pay for the items processed by the checkout assistant. The ones that he steals, he doesn't pay for. So the problem is to choose a subset of items to process (i.e., pay for) such that the sum of their ti's is enough to allow Bob to steal all the other items. Because for each item processed, during its ti seconds, Bob can steal up to ti items. But how do we model the total time available for stealing?

Wait, perhaps we need to select a subset S of items to process. The sum of their ti's must be at least equal to the number of items not in S (since each stolen item takes 1 second). Because each stolen item takes 1 second, and during the processing of items in S, Bob can accumulate ti seconds for each, which can be used to steal items. So the sum of the ti's for the processed items must be >= the number of stolen items (which is n - |S|). Because each stolen item requires 1 second, and the total available time is sum(t_i for i in S). So sum(t_i) >= (n - |S|). Then, the total cost is sum(c_i for i in S). We need to minimize this sum.

So the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of the items such that sum(t_i for i in S) >= (n - |S|), and the sum of c_i in S is minimized.

So this is a variation of the knapsack problem. Let's model it as such.

Let's formalize it:

We need to choose a subset S where sum(t_i for i in S) + |S| >= n. Because sum(t_i) >= (n - |S|) => sum(t_i) + |S| >= n.

Wait, sum(t_i) >= (n - |S|) is equivalent to sum(t_i) + |S| >= n + |S| - (n - |S|)? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the algebra here. Let's rephrase:

sum(t_i) >= (n - |S|) 

=> sum(t_i) + |S| >= n 

Because adding |S| to both sides gives sum(t_i) + |S| >= n - |S| + |S| => sum(t_i) + |S| >= n.

So the condition is sum(t_i) + |S| >= n.

But how to model this. Let's think of variables. For each item, we can choose to take it (include in S) or not. For each item, if taken, it contributes t_i to the sum, and increases |S| by 1. So the sum (sum(t_i) + |S|) is the sum of (t_i + 1) for each item in S. Because sum(t_i) + |S| = sum(t_i + 1 for i in S). So the condition is sum(t_i + 1 for i in S) >= n.

Ah, this is an important insight. So the problem can be rephrased as: select a subset S where sum (t_i + 1) over S is >= n. The cost of S is sum(c_i) over S. We need to find the minimal such cost.

So the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset S such that the sum of (t_i + 1) for S is >= n, and the sum of c_i for S is minimized.

This looks like a variation of the knapsack problem where we need to find the minimal cost to reach a certain capacity (n) with items having weights (t_i + 1). But in the knapsack problem, we usually have a maximum capacity and try to maximize the value. Here, it's the opposite: we need to cover at least a certain capacity with minimal cost.

So this is similar to the unbounded knapsack problem but in our case, each item can be taken at most once (since each item is either processed or stolen). So it's a 0-1 knapsack problem where we need to select items to reach a certain total weight (sum of (t_i +1) >= target) with minimal cost.

But the target is n, and the sum can exceed n, but we need the minimal sum where the total is >= n.

So the approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where dp[i][j] is the minimal cost to reach a sum of j using the first i items. However, since j can be up to (2000 items * (2000 + 1) per item) = 2000 * 2001 = 4,002,000. But considering that n can be up to 2000, but the sum needed can be up to that. But even if the sum exceeds n, it's acceptable. So the minimal j that is >= n is the target.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for each possible sum s, compute the minimal cost to reach s. Then, the answer is the minimal cost among all s >= n. But since s can be up to 2000 * (2000 +1) = 4,002,000, but perhaps we can cap it at n. Because if s is already >=n, then any higher sum is not better. So for example, once we reach a sum s >=n, any larger sum would have a higher cost (since we need to add more items). Wait, not necessarily. Maybe adding another item with a low cost but high (t_i +1) could allow a sum larger than n with lower cost. So we need to consider all possible s >=n and find the minimal cost.

But considering that n can be up to 2000, and each (t_i +1) can be up to 2001, the maximum possible sum s we need to consider is 2000 * 2001 = 4,002,000. But 4 million is manageable in terms of DP, but perhaps with some optimizations.

So the DP approach is to track for each possible sum s up to some maximum (like 4 million) the minimal cost to reach that sum. Then, among all s >=n, find the minimal cost.

But 4 million is a bit high. Let's calculate. For 2000 items, each with (t_i +1) up to 2001. So the maximum possible sum is 2000 * 2001 = 4,002,000. But the DP table would have a size of 4,002,000. But considering that for each item, we can process the current DP array and update it for the possible inclusion of the item.

The standard knapsack approach for 0-1 is:

Initialize a dp array where dp[s] is the minimal cost to reach sum s. Initially, dp[0] = 0, and others are infinity.

For each item, iterate from high to low s, and update dp[s + (t_i +1)] = min(dp[s + (t_i +1)], dp[s] + c_i).

Then, after processing all items, find the minimal dp[s] where s >=n.

But how big is s? The maximum possible sum is 2000*2001=4,002,000, but for n up to 2000. So the DP array would need to be of size 4,002,000 + 1. However, in Python, using a list of that size (4e6 elements) is manageable in terms of memory. Let's see: each element is an integer, and in Python, even a list of 4 million integers (each taking 28 bytes for small ints) would be around 112MB, which is under the 256MB limit. So that's manageable.

But wait, the problem constraints say that the memory per test is 256MB. So even for 4 million elements, each taking 4 bytes (if we use a numpy array, but in Python, the list of integers may take more space), but perhaps using a list and optimizing for space. Let's see. 4e6 elements, each as an integer. For example, in C++ each would take 4 bytes, but in Python, each int is an object, which takes more. However, 4 million elements in a list in Python would be about 4 million * 28 bytes (if each is a small integer), which is around 112MB. That's acceptable.

So the plan is:

- For all items, compute (t_i +1) as the weight, and c_i as the cost.

- The goal is to select a subset of these items with total weight >=n, and minimal total cost.

So the dynamic programming approach would be:

Initialize a dp array where dp[s] is the minimal cost to reach a sum of s. The initial state is dp[0] = 0, and all other dp[s] = infinity.

For each item (weight w, cost c):

   For s in reverse order from current_max_s down to 0:

      if dp[s] + c < dp[s + w], then update dp[s + w] to dp[s] + c.

After processing all items, the answer is the minimum dp[s] for all s >=n.

But we can optimize the maximum s we need to track. For example, once s exceeds n, adding more items may not be necessary. But in order to find the minimal cost, we have to track up to the maximum possible sum.

Alternatively, during the DP processing, for each possible sum up to (n + max_w), where max_w is the maximum (t_i +1) of all items. Because if the current sum is already larger than n, adding more items may not help, but perhaps a cheaper item could have a sum that's larger than n but with a lower cost. So we need to track up to the maximum possible sum, but perhaps in practice, the maximum sum we need to track is min(max_possible_sum, n + max_w), but that may not hold. So to be safe, we need to track up to the maximum possible sum.

But let's proceed with the standard approach.

In code, the steps would be:

Initialize the DP array with a size of (max_sum + 1), where max_sum is sum of all (t_i +1) for all items. But calculating this sum for each test case would be possible, but perhaps in code, during the DP processing, we can dynamically expand the array as needed.

But in Python, initializing a list with a maximum possible sum of 4 million is manageable. Let's see: n is up to 2000, and each t_i can be up to 2000. So for 2000 items, each (t_i +1) is up to 2001. So the maximum sum is 2000 * 2001 = 4,002,000. So preallocating a list of size 4e6 +1 is feasible.

But perhaps during the DP processing, the sum can't exceed that. So the code can be:

max_sum = sum(ti + 1 for ti in t_list)

But wait, no. The sum depends on which items are chosen. So the maximum possible sum is indeed the sum of all (ti +1) for all items.

But in the worst case, that's 2000 items each with ti=2000, so 2000*2001=4,002,000.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Read all the items, compute for each (ti + 1, ci).

Initialize dp as a list of size (max_sum +1) filled with infinity, except dp[0] =0.

Then for each (w, c) in the items:

   for s in range(max_sum, w-1, -1):

       if dp[s -w] + c < dp[s]:

           dp[s] = dp[s -w] +c

Wait, but in this case, the loop is over s from current_max down to w. But since the max_sum is fixed, perhaps in Python, we can precompute the sum of all (ti +1) as the initial max_sum, and then process each item, iterating from max_sum down to 0.

But this would require that the dp array is initialized to a size of sum_w (sum of all (ti +1)), which can be up to 4e6.

But for each item, when processing, the maximum possible sum after adding this item is sum_w.

But sum_w can be up to 4e6, which is manageable.

After processing all items, the answer is the minimal value of dp[s] for s >=n.

But we need to find the minimal cost among all s >=n where dp[s] is not infinity.

If there's no such s, then it's impossible, but according to the problem statement, since Bob can choose to process all items. For example, if all ti are 0, then sum(ti +1) for all items is sum(1 for each item) =n. Then, sum is n >=n, so that's possible.

So there must be a valid subset.

So the code steps:

Read n.

Read n pairs of ti and ci.

Compute list of (w, c) where w = ti +1, c = ci.

Compute sum_w = sum(w for w, c in items). This is the maximum possible sum.

Initialize dp = [infinity] * (sum_w +1)

dp[0] =0

for w, c in items:

   for s in range(sum_w, w-1, -1):

       if dp[s -w] + c < dp[s]:

           dp[s] = dp[s -w] +c

Then, after processing all items, iterate s from n to sum_w, and find the minimal dp[s].

But this approach is O(n * sum_w). Let's compute the time.

sum_w can be up to 2000 * 2001 =4e6.

n is up to 2000.

So total operations would be 2000 * 4e6 = 8e9. Which is way too much. Python can't handle that in 1 second (1e8 operations per second is the usual estimate).

So this approach is not feasible. Therefore, the standard knapsack approach won't work due to time constraints.

So we need a better approach.

Alternative idea: since we need the sum of (ti +1) >=n, perhaps we can model the problem as a variation where the required sum is exactly n, but allowing the sum to be up to n + maximum possible (ti +1). But even that might not help.

Wait, let's think again. The problem is to find the minimal sum of c_i for a subset S where sum(w_i) >=n. The sum w_i is sum(ti +1).

So perhaps the minimal sum is when sum(w_i) is just enough to cover n.

But how to model that.

Another approach: since the required sum is at least n, perhaps the minimal sum is the minimal cost when the sum of w_i is exactly s, where s >=n. So for each possible s >=n, we want the minimal cost.

But the standard approach would require a DP that tracks the minimal cost for each s up to the maximum possible sum. However, the problem is that the maximum sum is 4e6, which leads to O(n * 4e6) time, which is not feasible.

So we need a way to reduce the computational time.

Alternative idea: since the required sum is at least n, perhaps we can cap the sum at n + max_w. Because once the sum reaches n, adding more items may not be necessary, but since we can't stop early, perhaps the minimal cost is achieved with a sum as close to n as possible. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, an item with w=1000 and c=1 could be added even if sum exceeds n, but the cost is lower than a subset that exactly reaches n.

Hmm, but perhaps we can limit the maximum sum we track to n + max_w, where max_w is the maximum w_i of all items.

Because, once the sum is already >=n, adding another item would only increase the sum, but if the cost of that item is higher than the existing cost, it's not helpful. However, if the item has a lower cost than existing options, it might be better. For example, if we have a sum of s >=n, but adding an item with w_i=100 and c=0.5 could allow us to have a sum of s+100 >=n, with a lower cost.

But this complicates things. So perhaps we need to track up to n + max_w, where max_w is the maximum possible w_i. Because beyond that, any sum s >=n can be covered by a sum of up to n + max_w, since the last item added could be the one with the maximum w_i.

Wait, let's think. Suppose the current sum is s_prev, and adding an item with w_i gives s_prev + w_i. But if s_prev is already >=n, then adding this item would make the sum s_prev +w_i, but the cost is increased by c_i. Since we are looking for minimal cost, adding this item would not help. So once the sum is >=n, adding more items is not beneficial. Therefore, in the DP, once a sum s >=n is achieved, the minimal cost for that s is fixed, and adding more items would not yield a lower cost for any s' >=s.

Therefore, the optimal solution is the minimal cost for the minimal possible s >=n. Or, the minimal cost for all s >=n, but once you have a sum s >=n, adding more items (and thus paying more) can't help. Wait, but perhaps the item added has a lower cost than the current sum. For example, if a sum s=5 with cost 10, and adding an item with w_i=3 and c_i=1. Then s becomes 8, with cost 11. But this is worse. So adding items after reaching s >=n is not helpful.

So once we have a sum s >=n, any further items would only increase the sum (which is allowed) but would increase the cost. So the minimal cost is achieved when the sum is the minimal possible s >=n. Therefore, in the DP, once we have s >=n, we can ignore any further items. Wait, no. Because perhaps adding an item with a negative c_i. But since all c_i are >=1 (according to the input constraints, the second example has c_i=1, but the problem statement says 1<=ci<=1e9). So adding an item would only increase the cost. So once the sum is >=n, adding more items would not help, since the cost would increase.

So this is a crucial insight. Because, in this problem, all c_i are positive. So once we have a subset S where sum(w_i) >=n, adding more items (i.e., including another item in S) would only increase the total cost. Therefore, the minimal cost must be achieved by the subset S with sum(w_i) >=n and minimal sum(c_i), and which is as small as possible in sum(w_i). Therefore, during the DP, once a state s >=n is reached, any further transitions to s' = s + w_i (which would be >=s >=n) would have a higher cost (since c_i is positive). So in the DP, once a state s >=n is found, we can track it and not process any further transitions that lead to s' >=s.

Therefore, in the DP, for each item, when processing the possible sums s, once s >=n, we can skip processing those. So the DP can be optimized by only considering sums up to n + max_w, where max_w is the maximum possible w_i (ti+1) among all items. Because for a sum s that is >=n but less than n + max_w, adding a new item could lead to a sum that's up to s + max_w. However, once the sum s is >=n, any further transitions would not help. So perhaps we can cap the sum at n + max_w. Because any sum beyond that would have a cost higher than the minimal possible.

Wait, but even if s is already >=n, adding an item could result in a sum s' = s + w_i, which is >=n, but with a cost that is higher. So the minimal cost is not improved. So, once the DP has computed all possible sums up to n + max_w, any sum beyond that cannot be better than the minimal found up to that point.

Therefore, the maximum sum we need to track in the DP is n + max_w. Because any sum larger than that can't possibly be part of the minimal cost. Because the minimal cost for sum s >=n is already found in the range n <= s <= n + max_w.

So how to compute this. Let's see:

max_w is the maximum (ti +1) across all items. Let's say max_w is up to 2001 (since ti is up to 2000). So n can be up to 2000, so the sum cap is 2000 + 2001 = 4001. So the maximum sum we need to track is 4001. That's a huge improvement over 4 million.

Wait, but why? Let me explain again. Because once the sum is >=n, adding any more items (i.e., including them in the subset S) would only increase the cost, which we want to minimize. So the minimal cost is the minimal cost among all subsets S where sum(w_i) >=n. But adding an item to S increases the sum and the cost. So including more items in S would only make the cost higher. Therefore, the minimal cost can be found among subsets S where the sum is exactly the minimal possible sum >=n, or sums just a bit higher. However, if there exists an item with a very high w_i but very low c_i, adding it to a subset S that's already sum >=n could allow a higher sum but lower cost. But this is impossible because c_i is positive. For example, if a subset S1 has sum s1 >=n with cost c1, and another subset S2 that includes S1 plus an additional item with c=0.5. Then the cost of S2 is c1 +0.5 < c1. But in the problem statement, c_i >=1. So that's not possible. So adding items can only increase the cost. Therefore, once a sum s >=n is achieved, adding more items can't help reduce the cost. Therefore, the minimal cost for s >=n must be the minimal cost among all subsets that reach exactly s >=n, and the minimal such cost is achieved by the subset with the smallest possible sum (since adding more items would increase the cost). Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example:

n=3.

Suppose we have two items:

Item1: w=3 (ti=2), c=5.

Item2: w=2 (ti=1), c=4.

If we take item1: sum=3 >=3, cost=5.

If we take item2: sum=2 <3. So need to take another item. Suppose we take item1 and item2: sum=5, cost=9. Which is worse.

Alternatively, if there is an item3: w=4, c=3. Then taking item3 gives sum=4 >=3, cost=3, which is better than item1.

So the minimal cost is the minimal among all subsets S with sum >=n, regardless of their sum. So the sum could be larger than n, but the cost is lower. Therefore, the initial idea that once a sum s >=n is found, adding more items can't help is not correct, because adding a different item could lead to a sum that is higher than some existing sum, but with a lower cost.

So the previous reasoning was wrong. Because adding items can lead to a higher sum but lower cost. Therefore, the DP approach must consider all possible sums up to the maximum possible sum (4e6) to find the minimal cost. But that's computationally impossible for Python.

So this suggests that the standard knapsack approach won't work due to time constraints, and we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: since the sum needs to be >=n, and we are trying to minimize the cost, perhaps we can model the problem as a knapsack where the capacity is n, but the items have a weight of w_i and a cost of c_i. However, since we need the sum to be at least n, it's a variation where the knapsack's capacity is n, but we can take items beyond that. So the problem is similar to the minimal cost to cover a certain capacity.

This is known as the "knapsack cover" problem. There is a way to model this using dynamic programming where the capacity is n + max_w, which is feasible.

According to some references, the knapsack cover problem can be solved by considering a DP up to n + max_w. So for each item, the maximum possible increase in sum is max_w (the maximum w_i). So if we can cover up to n + max_w, then any sum beyond that is unnecessary because even if we take an item with max_w, adding it to a sum of n, it will sum to n + max_w. So the minimal cost for sum >=n can be found in the range [n, n + max_w].

If this is true, then the maximum sum we need to track is n + max_w. For n up to 2000 and max_w up to 2001, this sum is 2000 + 2001 = 4001. So the DP array can be of size 4001, which is manageable.

This approach is O(n * (n + max_w)), which for n=2000 and max_w=2001 is 2000 * 4001 = 8,002,000 operations. Which is acceptable in Python.

So the steps are:

Compute max_w as the maximum (ti +1) across all items.

Set the maximum sum to track as min(n + max_w, sum_all_w), where sum_all_w is the sum of all w_i. Because if sum_all_w is less than n + max_w, then it's not possible to reach sum_all_w.

But sum_all_w can be up to 4e6, but if sum_all_w is less than n, then it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the sum of all w_i (if you take all items) must be >=n, because otherwise, Bob can't steal all items. However, the problem statement says that Bob can choose which items to process. For example, if he processes all items, then the sum of their w_i is sum(ti+1) = sum(ti) + n. But this sum must be >=n, since sum(ti) >=0. So yes, sum of w_i when taking all items is sum(ti+1) = sum(ti) + n >=0 +n =n. So in any case, there is a solution (take all items). So the problem is always solvable.

But back to the approach.

The idea is to track up to sum = n + max_w.

So the DP will be initialized up to sum_cap = n + max_w.

But if the sum of all w_i is less than sum_cap, then the maximum sum possible is sum_all_w, and we need to track up to that.

But in code, we can compute sum_cap as min(n + max_w, sum_all_w).

But sum_all_w is the sum of all (ti+1) for all items. So sum_all_w could be up to 4e6, but for our purposes, sum_cap can be up to 4001, which is manageable.

Wait, if sum_all_w is less than n + max_w, then sum_cap is sum_all_w. But for example, if sum_all_w is 4000 and n + max_w is 4001, then sum_cap is 4000.

But how to compute sum_cap.

So in code:

sum_all_w = sum(w for w, c in items)

max_w = max(w for w, c in items) if items else 0

sum_cap = min(n + max_w, sum_all_w)

Then, the DP will track sums up to sum_cap.

But what if sum_all_w is less than n? Then sum_cap would be sum_all_w, which is less than n, but according to the problem statement, sum_all_w must be >=n (since taking all items gives sum_all_w >=n). Because sum_all_w = sum(ti +1 for all items) = sum(ti) +n. So sum(ti) >=0 (since ti can't be negative), so sum_all_w >=n. So sum_cap is at least n, since sum_all_w >=n and sum_cap is either sum_all_w or n+max_w (which is >=n).

So sum_cap >=n.

So the DP can be modeled as follows:

Initialize dp as a list of size sum_cap +1, filled with infinity, except dp[0] =0.

For each item (w, c):

   for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

       new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

       if dp[s -w] +c < dp[new_s]:

           dp[new_s] = dp[s -w] +c

But this is incorrect. Because when adding w to s -w, it could be that s -w +w =s, but we are considering up to sum_cap.

Alternatively, for each item, we process the current dp array in reverse order (from sum_cap down to 0). For each possible current sum s, if we include the item, the new sum is s +w. But since we are only tracking up to sum_cap, if s +w exceeds sum_cap, we cap it at sum_cap. Because any sum beyond sum_cap can't be better than the best sum up to sum_cap.

So for example, when adding an item, for each current sum s, the new sum is min(s +w, sum_cap). Then, dp[new_s] is the minimum between its current value and dp[s] + c.

But how to handle this correctly.

Alternatively, during the processing of each item, for each s in the current dp array (from sum_cap down to 0):

   if we include this item, then the new sum is s +w. If this new sum exceeds sum_cap, it's capped at sum_cap. So:

   new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

   if dp[new_s] > dp[s] + c:

       dp[new_s] = dp[s] +c

But how to handle the capping.

Wait, but the sum_cap is the maximum sum we need to track. So any sum beyond that is not needed because the minimal cost for sums >=n is already covered by considering up to sum_cap.

So for example, if sum_cap is n + max_w, then any sum s >=n + max_w can be considered as sum_cap, because adding any item would not contribute more than max_w. Therefore, the minimal cost for any sum >=n is the minimal cost between n and sum_cap.

So the approach is to cap the sum at sum_cap, and process the items in the DP by considering the sum up to sum_cap.

This way, the DP's time complexity is O(n * sum_cap), which for sum_cap up to 4000 is manageable.

Let's test this approach with the first example.

First example:

Input:

4

2 10 → w=3, c=10

0 20 → w=1, c=20

1 5 → w=2, c=5

1 3 →w=2, c=3

n=4.

max_w is max(3,1,2,2) →3.

sum_cap = min(4+3=7, sum_all_w=3+1+2+2=8) →7.

sum_cap is 7.

DP is initialized as [inf] *8 (indices 0 to7). dp[0]=0.

Processing items:

First item (3, 10):

Loop s from 7 downto 3:

s=7: new_s = min(7-3 +3=7, 7) →7. dp[7] is min(inf, 0 +10) →10.

s=6: new_s=6-3=3 →3+3=6. dp[6] =10.

s=5: new_s=5-3=2 →2+3=5. dp[5] =10.

s=4: new_s=1+3=4. dp[4] =10.

s=3: new_s=0+3=3. dp[3] =10.

Other s are processed, but dp remains inf except for 0.

After this item, dp is:

index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

values:0 inf inf 10 10 10 10 10

Second item (1, 20):

Processing s from 7 downto 1.

For s=7:

s -w =6. dp[6] is 10. 10 +20=30. dp[7] is min(10, 30) →10.

s=6:

s -w=5. dp[5] is 10. 10+20=30. current dp[6] is 10 → remains.

s=5: s -w=4 →10 +20=30. dp[5] is 10 → remains.

s=4: s -w=3 →10 +20=30. dp[4] is 10 → remains.

s=3: s -w=2 →inf → no change.

s=2: s -w=1 →inf → no change.

s=1: s -w=0 →0+20=20 → dp[1] is updated to 20.

So after this item, the dp becomes:

indexes 0-7:

0:0

1:20

others: same as before except for 1.

Third item (2,5):

Processing s from 7 downto 2.

For s=7:

s -2=5. dp[5] is 10. 10 +5=15. dp[7] is min(10, 15) →10.

s=6: s-2=4. dp[4] is 10. 15 → dp[6] remains 10.

s=5: s-2=3. dp[3] is 10. 10+5=15 → dp[5] is 10 → no change.

s=4: s-2=2. dp[2] is inf → no change.

s=3: s-2=1. dp[1] is 20. 20+5=25 → dp[3] is 10 → no change.

s=2: s-2=0 →0+5=5. dp[2] is updated to 5.

So after this item, dp[2] =5, and other entries:

index 7:10, 6:10, 5:10, 4:10, 3:10, 2:5, 1:20, 0:0.

Fourth item (2,3):

Processing s from 7 downto 2.

s=7: s-2=5. dp[5] is10 →10+3=13. current dp[7] is10 → no change.

s=6: s-2=4. dp[4] is10 →13 → no change.

s=5: s-2=3 →10+3=13 → current dp[5] is10 → no change.

s=4: s-2=2 →5+3=8 →dp[4] is10 → update to 8.

s=3: s-2=1 →20+3=23 → current dp[3] is10 → no change.

s=2: s-2=0 →0+3=3 → dp[2] is5 → no change.

So after this item, dp[4] becomes 8.

The final dp is:

0:0

1:20

2:5

3:10

4:8

5:10

6:10

7:10

Now, we need to find the minimal dp[s] where s >=4.

Looking from s=4 to s=7:

s=4:8

s=5:10

s=6:10

s=7:10.

So the minimal is 8, which matches the first example's output.

So this approach works.

So the steps in code are:

1. Read n.

2. Read n pairs (ti, ci). For each, compute w = ti +1, c =ci.

3. Compute sum_all_w = sum(w for w, c in items). Also compute max_w = max(w for w, c in items) if items else 0.

4. sum_cap = min(n + max_w, sum_all_w).

   Since sum_all_w >=n, sum_cap is at least n.

5. Initialize dp array of size sum_cap +1, filled with infinity, dp[0] =0.

6. For each (w, c) in items:

   for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

       new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

       if dp[s -w] + c < dp[new_s]:

           dp[new_s] = dp[s -w] +c

7. The answer is the minimal value in dp[n : sum_cap+1].

So the code would look like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    items = []

    sum_all_w = 0

    max_w = 0

    for _ in range(n):

        ti, ci = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

        w = ti + 1

        items.append( (w, ci) )

        sum_all_w += w

        if w > max_w:

            max_w = w

    sum_cap = min( n + max_w, sum_all_w )

    INF = float('inf')

    dp = [INF] * (sum_cap +1)

    dp[0] =0

    for w, c in items:

        # Iterate from sum_cap down to w.

        for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

            new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

            if dp[s -w] + c < dp[new_s]:

                dp[new_s] = dp[s -w] + c

    # Find the minimal cost in dp[n ... sum_cap]

    result = min( dp[n : sum_cap+1] )

    print(result, file=output_stream)

Second sample input:

3

0 1 → w=1

0 10 →w=1

0 100 →w=1

sum_all_w =3*1=3. n=3. max_w=1.

sum_cap = min(3+1=4, 3) →3.

sum_cap is3.

Processing each item:

Initial dp[0] =0.

First item (1,1):

For s from3 downto1:

s=3: s -1=2 → new_s = min(3+1,3) =3. dp[3] =0+1=1.

s=2: new_s= min(2+1=3 →3. dp[3] is min(1, 0+1) →1.

s=1: new_s=0+1=1. dp[1] =1.

After first item:

dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=INF, dp[3]=1.

Second item (1,10):

Processing s from3 downto1:

s=3: s-1=2 → inf. dp[3] remains1.

s=2: s-1=1 →1+10=11 → new_s=3. dp[3] is min(1, 11) →1.

s=1: new_s=0+10=10 →s=1, new_s=1+1=2. dp[2] =10+0=10.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the code.

Wait, the second item is (1,10). For s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1), which is 3 downto 0 (since w=1). But in code, the loop is sum_cap downto w-1, which for w=1, w-1=0. So the loop is from 3 downto 0, step -1.

Processing s=3:

s -w=3-1=2. dp[2] is INF. So no change.

s=2: s -w=1. dp[1] is 1. So new_s=2+1=3. dp[3] = min(1, 1+10=11) →1 remains.

s=1: s-w=0. dp[0] is 0. new_s=1+1=2. dp[2] becomes 0+10=10.

s=0: s >=w-1 (0 >=0). So s=0 can be processed. But since 0 >=w-1=0, the loop includes s=0. But when s=0, s-w= -1, which is invalid. So in code, the loop is for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1). For w=1, w-1=0. So s runs from3 downto 0. But when s=0, s-w=0-1= -1 → which is invalid. So the code would check s >=w, because s is from sum_cap downto w-1, but when s <w, s -w is negative and thus the code skips.

Wait, no. The code for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1) includes s values down to w-1. But for each s, the code is:

new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

But to compute s -w, we need s >=w. Otherwise, s -w would be negative, and accessing dp[s -w] would be invalid.

So in the code, when s <w, the code skips the update. Because for s in the loop, the code is:

for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

    if s >=w:

        new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

        if dp[s -w] + c < dp[new_s]:

            ...

But in the code as written, the loop runs for s from sum_cap downto w-1, but if s <w, then s -w is negative, and accessing dp[s -w] would be invalid. So there's a bug here.

Wait, the code currently is:

for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

    new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

    if dp[s -w] +c < dp[new_s]:

        dp[new_s] = dp[s -w] +c

But when s <w, s -w is negative, leading to dp[s-w] which is dp[negative index], which is invalid. So this is a bug.

Ah! This is a problem. The loop runs from sum_cap downto w-1, which for w=1 would be down to 0. But for s=0, s-w is -1. So this code would crash with an index error.

So the code needs to process only s >=w. So the loop should be for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1), but inside the loop, check if s >=w. Or, the loop should be from min(sum_cap, sum_cap) downto w.

Wait, the loop should be for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1), but s must be >=w for the code to proceed. So inside the loop, only process s >=w. So:

for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

    if s >=w:

        new_s = min(s +w, sum_cap)

        if dp[s -w] +c < dp[new_s]:

            dp[new_s] = dp[s -w] +c

Otherwise, skip.

So the code needs to include an 'if s >=w' check inside the loop.

This is a critical error in the previous code.

So the corrected code would be:

for w, c in items:

    for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

        if s >=w:

            new_s = min(s + w, sum_cap)

            if dp[s - w] + c < dp[new_s]:

                dp[new_s] = dp[s - w] + c

So this way, when s <w, the code skips the processing.

This adjustment is necessary to avoid indexing errors.

Now, let's re-examine the second sample with this correction.

Second sample input:

n=3.

Items:

w=1, c=1

w=1, c=10

w=1, c=100

sum_all_w=3.

max_w=1.

sum_cap = min(3+1=4, 3) →3.

So sum_cap=3.

Processing first item (w=1, c=1):

Loop s from3 downto0:

s=3: s >=w=1 → yes. new_s= min(3+1=4,3) →3. dp[3-1] is dp[2], which is INF. So dp[3] remains INF.

Wait, no. Initially, dp is [0, INF, INF, INF].

Processing s=3: s >=w=1 → yes.

new_s = min(3+1,3) →3.

dp[s -w] = dp[3-1=2] →INF. So adding 1 gives INF+1 → no change.

So after s=3, dp[3] remains INF.

s=2: >=w=1 → yes. new_s=3. dp[2-1=1] is INF → no change.

s=1: >=1 → yes. new_s=2. dp[0] is0. So dp[2] =0+1=1.

s=0: loop continues, but s=0 <w=1 → skipped.

After first item, dp is:

0:0, 1: INF, 2:1, 3: INF.

Processing second item (w=1, c=10):

Loop s from3 downto0:

s=3: s >=1 → yes. new_s=3. s -w=2. dp[2] is1. 1+10=11. dp[3] is INF → becomes 11.

s=2: new_s=3. dp[2-1=1] is INF → no change. dp[3] remains 11.

s=1: new_s=2. dp[0] is0. 0+10=10. dp[2] is currently1 → updated to min(1,10) →1 remains.

s=0: skipped.

After second item, dp is:

0:0, 1:INF, 2:1, 3:11.

Processing third item (w=1, c=100):

Loop s from3 downto0:

s=3: s >=1 → yes. new_s=3. s -w=2. dp[2] is1. 1+100=101. dp[3] is11 → no change.

s=2: new_s=3. dp[2-1=1] is INF → no change.

s=1: new_s=2. dp[0]+100=100. dp[2] is1 → no change.

s=0: skipped.

After third item, dp remains the same.

Now, the answer is the minimal of dp[3 ...3] → dp[3] is11. But the sample output is 111. Which is wrong.

Wait, but the sample input is:

3

0 1

0 10

0 100

Each item has ti=0 →w=1. So sum_all_w=3, sum_cap=3+1=4. But sum_all_w is3, so sum_cap= min(4,3) →3.

So when processing the first item (w=1, c=1):

Loop s from3 downto0:

s=3: s >=1 → yes. new_s=3. s -w=2. dp[2] isINF → no change.

s=2: s >=1 → yes. new_s=3. s -w=1 → dp[1] is INF.

s=1: new_s=2. s -w=0 → dp[0] is0. So new_s=2 → dp[2] =0+1=1.

s=0: skipped.

So after first item, dp[0]=0, dp[2]=1, others INF.

Second item (w=1, c=10):

s=3: new_s=3. s-w=2. dp[2]=1 → new_s=3: 1+10=11.

s=2: new_s=3. s-w=1: dp[1] is INF.

s=1: new_s=2. s-w=0: dp[0]+10=10. dp[2] is1 → no change.

s=0: skipped.

So after second item, dp[3] is11.

Third item (w=1, c=100):

s=3: new_s=3. s-w=2. dp[2] is1 → new_s=3: 1+100=101 → no change as 11 is better.

s=2: new_s=3. s-w=1: dp[1] is INF.

s=1: new_s=2. dp[0] +100=100 → dp[2] is1 → no change.

So after all items, dp[3] is11. But the sample's correct output is 111. This is a problem.

Wait, this suggests that the code gives the wrong answer for this sample. But the sample's correct output is 111. What's wrong here?

Wait, the sample input is:

3

0 1 → processed: ti=0 →w=1, c=1.

0 10 →w=1, c=10.

0 100 →w=1, c=100.

Bob needs to choose the order of items for the checkout assistant to process, and decide which to process and which to steal.

But in this case, all items have ti=0. So when the checkout assistant is processing any item, Bob cannot steal anything during that item's processing time. Because ti=0 implies that during the processing time of this item (0 seconds), Bob can't steal anything.

So to steal an item, Bob needs to have time. For example, the sum of the w_i for the processed items must be >=3. Because sum(w_i) = sum(ti +1) for the processed items. Since ti is 0, sum(ti +1) = |S|, where S is the set of processed items. So sum(w_i) = |S|. We need |S| >=3. So S must be all 3 items. Because |S| =3, sum(w_i) =3 >=3.

So the cost is 1 +10 +100 = 111. Which is the sample's correct output.

But according to the code's logic, the DP will track up to sum_cap=3.

For each item, when processing, the code allows including the item.

But when sum_cap=3, the maximum sum we track is3.

Processing the three items:

The code's steps:

After first item (w=1, c=1):

dp[0] =0, dp[1] =1.

But sum_cap=3. Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

The code's sum_cap is min(3+1=4, 3) →3.

So sum_cap is3.

The first item's processing:

Loop s from3 downto0:

s=3: >=1? yes.

new_s = min(3+1,3) →3.

s-w=2. dp[2] isINF.

So dp[3] remains INF.

s=2: new_s=3 → s-w=1 → dp[1] isINF.

s=1: new_s=2 → s-w=0 → dp[0] +1 =1 → dp[1] =1.

s=0: skipped.

So after first item:

dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, others INF.

Second item (w=1, c=10):

s=3: s-w=2 → dp[2] INF → no change.

s=2: s-w=1 → dp[1] is1. new_s=3. dp[3] =1+10=11.

s=1: new_s=2 → s-w=0 → dp[0] +10=10. dp[2] is INF → becomes10.

s=0: skipped.

After second item:

dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=10, dp[3]=11.

Third item (w=1, c=100):

s=3: s-w=2 → dp[2] =10 → new_s=3. 10+100=110 → current dp[3] is11 → no change.

s=2: new_s=3. s-w=1 → dp[1] is1 → 1+100=101. 101 <11 → no. 101 is larger than11.

s=1: new_s=2 → s-w=0 → dp[0]+100=100. dp[2] is10 → updated to 100? No, 100>10. So no change.

s=0: skipped.

After third item, dp[3] is11.

But the correct answer is 111.

So this code is incorrect. Why?

Ah, because in the code's model, the sum of w_i (ti+1) for the processed items is >=n. But in this case, the sum must be >=3.

But in the code's sum_cap=3, the sum of processed items' w_i must be at least3.

But in this case, the only way to achieve sum>=3 is to select all 3 items. Because each item's w_i is1. So sum is3.

So the cost is1+10+100=111. But according to the code's DP, dp[3] is11. Which is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

The code's code for processing items is allowing sum to be up to sum_cap=3.

But when processing the third item, after the first two items, the code's dp[3] is11, which is the cost for selecting the first and second items (1+10=11). But their sum is2, which is <3. So how did the code get dp[3]=11?

Ah, this is the mistake.

Because when processing the second item (w=1, c=10), in the loop:

s=2 (which is sum_cap=3, but s is 2? Wait, sum_cap=3. So s ranges from3 downto0.

Processing s=3:

s=3, w=1: s >=1 → yes.

new_s = min(3+1,3) →3.

s-w=2. dp[2] is INF (after first item) → no change.

s=2: s >=1 → yes.

new_s=3.

s-w=1. dp[1] is1 (from first item) → 1+10=11 → dp[3] becomes11.

s=1: s >=1 → yes.

new_s=2.

s-w=0. dp[0]+10=10 → dp[2] is INF → becomes10.

So after processing the second item, dp[3] is11, which is the sum of the first two items (sum is2) → no, sum is1+1=2. But the sum is2, which is less than3. So the code's model is incorrect.

Ah! Here's the error.

The code's approach is to track the sum of w_i, which is sum(ti+1) for the processed items. But the sum of these must be >=n.

But the code allows sum to be capped at sum_cap=3. But when processing items, if adding an item's w to a current sum s (s < sum_cap) results in s +w >= sum_cap, then the code sets new_s to sum_cap. But sum_cap is3.

For example, processing the second item:

s=2 (sum=2). Adding w=1 gives 3, which is sum_cap.

So in the DP, sum_cap=3 represents sums >=3. But sum_cap=3 is exactly the required sum for n=3.

So when the sum is3, sum(w_i) is3, which meets the requirement.

But in the code's processing of the second item, the sum_cap=3. When the current sum is2, adding w=1 gives3. So the sum is3, which is >=3, so the cost for sum3 is11 (1+10). But according to the problem's requirement, the sum of w_i must be >=n. So sum3 is3 >=3. But this is only possible if the subset S has sum(w_i) =3. But in this case, sum(w_i) for S (first and second item) is1+1=2, which is not >=3. So the code is incorrectly capping the sum.

Ah! This is the root of the problem.

The code's approach is to cap the sum at sum_cap = min(n + max_w, sum_all_w). But this leads to incorrect handling because the sum_cap may be higher than the sum of processed items. For example, when sum_cap is3 and the sum of the processed items is2, adding an item with w=1 gives a sum of3, which is capped to3. But the actual sum of processed items is3. However, in reality, the sum of the items processed is3 only if the sum of their w_i is3. But in the example, the sum is 1+1=2, but when added to an item with w=1, the sum becomes3. So the code is correctly modeling the sum of the processed items.

Wait, no. Because when the code adds the third item (w=1), the sum of processed items is3. So the code is correct in that case. But in the second item's processing, adding the second item to the first (sum of2) gives sum3. But this is only possible if the sum of the processed items is2 +1=3. Which is correct.

So in the code, when processing the second item, the sum of the two items' w_i is2. But when added to the sum_cap, the code treats it as3. Which is not correct.

Wait, no. For example, when we have two items with w=1, their sum is2. But in the code, when processing the second item, the code allows adding it to s=2 (sum of2) to reach sum3 (sum_cap=3). Which is correct. Because the sum of the two items is2, but the code allows the sum to be capped at3, which is the sum_cap. But the actual sum of the two items is2, which is less than3. So the code's model is incorrect.

So the code is modeling the sum as the minimum of the actual sum and sum_cap. But this is wrong because the sum of the processed items must be >=n. The code's model allows sum_cap to represent sums >=n, but this leads to incorrect transitions.

This is the fundamental error in the code's logic.

The correct approach is to track the actual sum of the processed items, and the sum_cap is used to limit the sum to a manageable value. But in the current code, when adding an item's w to a current sum s, the code allows the new sum to be s +w, but if that exceeds sum_cap, it's capped. This leads to incorrect transitions where the code treats the sum as sum_cap even if the actual sum is less than sum_cap.

For example, in the second sample, sum_cap=3. Processing the first two items (sum of1+1=2) would be stored as sum_cap=3. But the actual sum is2, which is less than3, so the sum is not sufficient. But the code's model allows this.

So the code's approach is incorrect. Therefore, the previous reasoning about the sum_cap being n + max_w is not correct, and the approach is flawed.

This means that the initial approach is incorrect, and the code needs to be reworked.

So what's the correct approach?

The problem is that the code's DP tracks the sum of processed items up to sum_cap, but this sum can be the actual sum or the sum_cap. This leads to incorrect transitions where the sum is not properly tracked.

The correct way to model the sum is to track it exactly up to sum_cap. But sum_cap must be chosen such that any sum >=n can be covered by sums up to sum_cap. The initial idea was that sum_cap =n + max_w, so that any sum >=n can be represented by the minimal possible sum up to n + max_w. But this requires that for any sum s >=n, there exists a sum s' in [n, n + max_w] such that the cost of s' is <= the cost of s. However, this is not the case. For example, if you have an item with a very high w and low c, adding it to a sum s >=n can lead to a sum s +w that exceeds n + max_w, but with a lower cost than any sum in [n, n + max_w].

So this approach is incorrect.

Therefore, the only feasible solution is to track the sum up to sum_all_w, which is up to 4e6. But in Python, with n=2000 and sum_all_w=4e6, the DP will have 4e6 elements and 2000 items, leading to 8e9 operations. This is impossible in Python.

So what's the alternative?

Another approach is to model the problem differently. Since each item can be processed or stolen, and the sum of (ti +1) for processed items must be >=n, we can model this as a variation of the knapsack problem where the goal is to select a subset of items with sum >=n and minimal cost.

But how to model this efficiently.

An alternative idea is to use a dynamic programming approach that tracks the maximum possible sum for a given cost. But this also may not be feasible.

Alternatively, we can use a different state representation. For example, for each possible number of processed items k, track the minimal sum of (ti +1) for exactly k processed items. Then, for each k, the sum must be >=n. The minimal cost is the minimal sum of c_i for k items where sum(ti +1) >=n.

But this is another approach. Let's think about it.

Let's define dp[k] as the minimal sum of (ti +1) for exactly k processed items. Then, for each k, if dp[k] >=n, then the cost is sum of c_i for those k items. We need to find the minimal cost among all k where dp[k] >=n.

But how to compute this.

This is similar to a knapsack problem where we want to select exactly k items to maximize the sum of (ti +1) (but here we need to track for each k the minimal sum of c_i and the sum of (ti+1) is >=n).

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

For each possible number of processed items k (from 0 to n), track the minimal possible sum of (ti +1) for any subset of k items, and the minimal cost to achieve that sum.

Then, for each k, if the sum of (ti+1) for k items is >=n, then the cost is a candidate for the minimal cost.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, we can use a 2D DP where dp[k][s] represents the minimal cost to select k items with a sum of s. Then, for each k, we need to find s >=n, and the minimal cost.

But the state space for this would be 2000 (k) *4e6 (s) which is 8e9, which is impossible.

Alternatively, for each k, we can track the maximal sum of (ti +1) for exactly k items. Then, for each k, if this maximal sum is >=n, the minimal cost is the minimal sum of c_i for exactly k items with sum >=n. But this is not straightforward.

Another approach: since the sum of (ti +1) for the selected items must be >=n, and we want to minimize the cost, perhaps the optimal solution is to select items with the smallest c_i per (ti+1) ratio. But this is a greedy approach, which may not work.

But greedy approaches are often incorrect for knapsack-like problems. For example, consider items with high c_i but very high (ti +1), which may allow covering n with fewer items but higher cost.

But perhaps there's a way to model this as a greedy problem.

Alternatively, for each item, we can compute the value (ti +1) per c_i, and select items with the highest ratio first. But this may not lead to the minimal cost.

For example, if two items have (w=3, c=10) and (w=2, c=5). The ratios are 3/10=0.3 and 2/5=0.4. So the second item has a higher ratio. But including the first item may lead to a higher sum with lower cost.

But this is just a hypothetical example.

So the greedy approach is unlikely to work.

Another idea: since the sum of (ti +1) is additive, perhaps we can model this as a standard knapsack problem where the capacity is n, and the items are to be selected to cover the capacity. The minimal cost for the knapsack problem where the sum must be at least the capacity.

This is the same as the initial problem.

But how to model this in a way that is efficient.

In the standard knapsack problem, the minimal cost to reach a capacity of at least T can be solved by extending the DP up to T + max_w, where max_w is the maximum weight of any item. This is the approach taken in some references for the knapsack cover problem.

The idea is that for any sum >=T, the minimal cost can be found by considering sums up to T + max_w. Because adding another item's weight beyond that would not improve the cost, since all c_i are positive.

So the approach is to set the capacity to T + max_w, and compute the standard knapsack DP for this capacity. Then, the answer is the minimal cost among all dp[s] where s >= T.

In our case, T is n, and the weights are (ti +1).

So the steps are:

1. Compute max_w = max(ti+1 for all items).

2. Compute sum_cap = n + max_w.

3. Initialize a DP array where dp[s] is the minimal cost to achieve a sum of s. The array is initialized to infinity except dp[0] =0.

4. For each item (w, c):

   for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

       if dp[s -w] +c < dp[s]:

           dp[s] = dp[s -w] +c

5. The answer is the minimal value of dp[s] for s >=n.

This approach is similar to the previous code but without capping the sum_cap to sum_all_w. Because even if sum_all_w is less than sum_cap (n + max_w), the code will process the items, but the sum_cap can be larger than sum_all_w, leading to some s values that are not reachable.

But in this approach, the sum_cap is n + max_w, which is up to 2000 +2001=4001. So the DP array can be of size 4001 +1 =4002. This makes the time complexity O(n * sum_cap) = 2000 *4001=8e6 operations, which is manageable.

But what if sum_all_w <n +max_w? For example, if sum_all_w is less than n +max_w, but sum_all_w >=n. Then, the code will process items up to sum_cap =n +max_w, but the actual sum_all_w may be less than sum_cap, so some s in the DP are not reachable. However, when checking for s >=n, the minimal cost will be found in the DP up to sum_all_w.

So the code must compute sum_cap as n +max_w, and initialize the DP array to that sum_cap.

So the code for the second sample would be:

sum_cap =3 +1=4.

Processing each item:

First item (1,1):

After processing, dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, others INF.

Second item (1,10):

After processing, dp[0]=0, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1+10=11, dp[3]=11+10=21, dp[4]=21+10=31.

But the sum_cap is4.

Third item (1,100):

After processing:

dp[1] can be updated by adding the third item to sum 0 →1.

But wait, let's go through the code:

Initial dp after second item is:

s:0 1 2 3 4

c:0 1 11 21 31

Processing third item (1,100):

For s from4 downto0:

s=4:

s >=1 → yes.

s-w=3. dp[3] is21. 21+100=121. Current dp[4] is31 → no change.

s=3:

s-w=2. dp[2] is11 → 11+100=111 → dp[3]=21 → no change.

s=2:

s-w=1 →1 +100=101. current dp[2] is11 → no change.

s=1:

s-w=0 →0 +100=100. current dp[1] is1 → no change.

s=0:

skipped.

So after processing third item, dp[1] remains1, dp[2] remains11, dp[3] remains21, dp[4] remains31.

Now, the answer is the minimal of dp[s] for s >=3.

dp[3]=21, dp[4]=31. So minimal is21.

But the correct answer is111. So the code is incorrect.

Ah, no. The correct answer is the sum of all three items (1+10+100=111), but according to the code, the minimal cost is21, which is not correct.

This suggests that the approach is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Because the code's sum_cap is4 (n=3 +max_w=1).

But the sum of all three items' w_i is3. So the code's DP tracks up to sum4, but the sum3 is3, which is >=3.

So the code's DP should have an entry for s=3. Let's see:

After processing the third item, the code's steps:

Processing s=3:

s=3, w=1.

s-w=2. dp[2] is11 →11+100=111. current dp[3] is21 → so 111 is larger than21 → no change.

But the code's dp[3] is21. How was this achieved?

Let's retrace:

After processing the first two items:

s=3: sum is3 (sum of items 1 and 2's w=1+1=2, but sum_cap=4. So adding the second item to sum 2 gives sum3. But the actual sum of two items is2, which is less than3. So the code is modeling the sum as3, but the actual sum is2.

This is the root of the problem. The code's DP is allowing sums up to sum_cap, which is beyond the actual sum of the items. So the code's model is incorrect.

Therefore, the initial approach is incorrect. This suggests that the DP approach must track the exact sum of the items, not capped. But this would require sum_cap up to 4e6, which is impossible in Python.

So the problem is challenging.

Alternative idea: Since the sum of (ti +1) must be >=n, and each (ti +1) is at least 1 (since ti >=0), the minimal number of items required to process is ceiling(n / max_possible (ti+1)), but this is not helpful.

Another approach: For each item, the contribution to the sum is (ti+1), and the cost is ci. We need to choose a subset of items such that the sum of (ti+1) is >=n, with minimal cost.

This is the same as the classic knapsack problem, but with the target being to reach at least a certain sum, and we need to find the minimal cost.

The correct way to model this is to use a dynamic programming approach that tracks the minimal cost for each possible sum up to the maximum possible sum. However, this is not feasible due to the large sum.

But perhaps we can use a different approach, such as using a priority queue or branch and bound.

Alternatively, we can note that the sum of (ti+1) is at least 1 for each item. Therefore, the minimal number of items required is ceil(n / max(ti+1)). But this may not be helpful.

Another Idea:

Let's consider that for each item, the (ti+1) is the weight. We need to find the subset of items whose sum of weights is >=n, with minimal cost.

This is the same as the knapsack problem where we want to cover a certain capacity with minimal cost, but items have varying weights and costs.

In this case, the problem is the same as the "unbounded knapsack cover" problem, but for 0-1 items.

The solution for the unbounded case is to use a DP up to T + max_w, where T is the target. But for the 0-1 case, the same approach is applicable.

So, according to some references, the approach is to compute the DP up to T + max_w.

So in code:

sum_cap = n + max_w

Initialize dp as a list of size sum_cap +1, filled with infinity, dp[0] =0.

For each item (w, c):

   for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

       if dp[s -w] +c < dp[s]:

           dp[s] = dp[s -w] +c

Then, the answer is the minimal dp[s] for s >=n.

So, in the second sample:

sum_cap=3 +1=4.

Processing each item:

After processing first two items:

s=3 is achieved by selecting the first and second items. sum is1+1=2. So the code's model is incorrect.

But according to this approach, the code would process the third item and s=3 would be updated.

Wait, let's reprocess the second sample with this approach:

sum_cap=4.

Processing first item (w=1, c=1):

s ranges from4 downto1.

s=4: s -1=3 → dp[3] isINF.

s=3: s-1=2 →INF.

s=2: s-1=1 →INF.

s=1: s-1=0 →0+1=1.

So after first item, dp[1]=1, others INF.

Processing second item (w=1, c=10):

s=4: s-1=3 →INF.

s=3: s-1=2 →INF.

s=2: s-1=1 →1+10=11 →dp[2]=11.

s=1: s-1=0 →0+10=10 →dp[1] is1 → no change.

So after second item, dp[2]=11, dp[1]=1.

Processing third item (w=1, c=100):

s=4: s-1=3 →INF.

s=3: s-1=2 →11 +100=111 →dp[3]=111.

s=2: s-1=1 →1+100=101 →dp[2] is11 → no change.

s=1: s-1=0 →0+100=100 →dp[1] is1 → no change.

Now, the dp array is:

0:0

1:1

2:11

3:111

4:INF

The answer is the minimal dp[s] for s >=3.

dp[3] =111, which is correct.

So why did this approach work for the second sample, but the previous code with sum_cap=3 failed?

Because in the previous code, sum_cap was min(n +max_w, sum_all_w), which for the second sample was3, leading to incorrect processing. But the correct approach is to set sum_cap= n +max_w regardless of sum_all_w.

So the code should set sum_cap= n +max_w, and ignore sum_all_w.

Thus, the corrected code should be:

n = int(input())

items = []

max_w = 0

for _ in range(n):

    ti, ci = map(int, input().split())

    w = ti +1

    items.append( (w, ci) )

    if w > max_w:

        max_w = w

sum_cap = n + max_w

INF = float('inf')

dp = [INF] * (sum_cap +1)

dp[0] =0

for w, c in items:

    for s in range(sum_cap, w-1, -1):

        if dp[s -w] + c < dp[s]:

            dp[s] = dp[s -w] + c

result = INF

for s in range(n, sum_cap +1):

    if dp[s] < result:

        result = dp[s]

print(result)

This code for the second sample:

sum_cap=3+1=4.

Processing the three items:

After processing all three items, dp[3] is111. So the code outputs111, which is correct.

The first sample:

sum_cap=4+3=7. The code correctly processes all items and finds the minimal dp[4] =8.

Thus, the code works.

The key mistake in the previous code was capping the sum_cap at sum_all_w. The correct approach is to set sum_cap to n +max_w, regardless of sum_all_w.

This way, even if the sum of all items' w_i is less than sum_cap, the code will still process up to sum_cap. But the answer will be the minimal cost for all possible s >=n. 

Thus, the correct code is as above.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
items = []
max_w = 0
for _ in range(n):
    ti, ci = map(int, input().split())
    w = ti + 1
    items.append((w, ci))
    if w > max_w:
        max_w = w

sum_cap = n + max_w
INF = float('inf')
dp = [INF] * (sum_cap + 1)
dp[0] = 0

for w, c in items:
    for s in range(sum_cap, w - 1, -1):
        if dp[s - w] + c < dp[s]:
            dp[s] = dp[s - w] + c

result = INF
for s in range(n, sum_cap + 1):
    if dp[s] < result:
        result = dp[s]

print(result)
```
