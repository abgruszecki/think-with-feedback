Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of frames Nicholas can make using his sticks. Each frame requires two pairs of sticks: two of length h and two of length w. They can be the same (so a square needs four sticks of the same length). So the goal is to count how many such pairs we can form from the available sticks.

First, I need to process the list of stick lengths and count how many sticks there are of each length. For each length, the number of pairs possible is the count divided by 2, since each pair uses two sticks. For example, if there are 5 sticks of a certain length, that's 5//2=2 pairs (since 2 pairs use 4 sticks).

Once we have all the pairs, we need to figure out how to combine them into frames. Each frame requires two pairs. But these pairs can be either from the same length (forming a square) or two different lengths (rectangle). However, the problem allows the same pairs to form multiple frames as long as the sticks are available. Wait, no, once a pair is used in a frame, those sticks are consumed and can't be used again.

Wait, the problem says that the frames are made from the sticks. So each frame uses exactly four sticks: two pairs. So each frame uses two pairs. So the problem reduces to: how many pairs of pairs can we form, where each frame uses two pairs. But the pairs can be of the same length (square) or different (rectangle). But each pair is two sticks. So each frame uses two pairs, which could be two pairs from the same length (four sticks of that length) or two pairs from different lengths (two sticks each from two different lengths).

So the key is to count all possible pairs from the sticks, then determine how to group them into pairs of pairs (each group of two pairs forms one frame). The maximum number of frames is equal to the total number of pairs divided by 2, but perhaps not exactly, because when pairs come in the same count, like if you have three pairs, you can make 1 frame (using two pairs) and leave one pair unused.

Wait, wait. Let's think. Let's say the counts of pairs are as follows. For example, if you have a total of x pairs. Then each frame uses two pairs. So the maximum number of frames is x // 2. Because each frame requires two pairs, regardless of their types. Because each pair can be combined with another pair (same or different length) to form a frame.

So the solution would be:

1. Count the number of pairs for each stick length. For each a_i, count how many times it occurs, then divide by 2. Sum all these to get the total number of pairs.

2. The maximum number of frames is the total pairs divided by 2, using integer division. Because each frame uses two pairs.

Wait, that's right. Because each frame is two pairs. So even if you have three pairs, that's 3 // 2 = 1 frame. So the answer is (total_pairs) // 2.

But wait, let's test this against the examples.

First example:

Input: 5 sticks [2,4,3,2,3]

The counts are:

2: 2 → 1 pair

4: 1 → 0 pairs

3: 2 → 1 pair

Total pairs: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Then 2 // 2 = 1 → which matches the output.

Second example:

Sticks: 2,2,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,7,7,9,9

Counts:

2: 2 → 1 pair

4:4 → 2 pairs

6:3 → 1 pair (since 3//2=1)

7:2 → 1 pair

9:2 → 1 pair

So total pairs: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. 6//2=3 → which matches the output.

Third example:

4 sticks: 3,3,3,5.

Counts:

3:3 → 1 pair

5:1 → 0.

Total pairs: 1. 1//2=0 → correct.

Another test case: If we have 4 pairs. 4//2=2 frames. Which makes sense. Each frame uses two pairs.

So this logic seems correct.

So the steps are:

- Count the frequency of each stick length.

- For each frequency, compute the number of pairs (count // 2).

- Sum all these pairs to get the total.

- The answer is total // 2.

So the code can be written as:

Read n, then the list of a_i.

Create a frequency dictionary (like using a Counter).

Sum each count //2 for all keys in the Counter.

Then divide that sum by 2 (integer division) and that's the answer.

So the code would look something like:

from collections import Counter

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
counts = Counter(a)
total_pairs = sum(v // 2 for v in counts.values())
print(total_pairs // 2)

Wait, that's all? Let's test this against the examples.

First example: the sum is 1 + 1 = 2 → 2//2=1 → correct.

Second example: 1 (from 2) + 2 (from 4) + 1 (6) +1 (7) +1 (9) = 6 → 3 → correct.

Third example: 3//2=1 (from 3) → sum is 1 → 0 → correct.

Another test case where sum is 5: 5//2=2 frames.

Yes.

So this code should work. But why didn't the third example's 4 sticks (3,3,3,5) produce a pair? Because the three 3s make 1 pair (using two sticks), leaving one 3, and the 5 can't form a pair. So total pairs is 1. 1//2=0.

So the code works. So the approach is correct.

So the optimal approach is O(n) time, using a frequency count. The constraints are n up to 100, which is trivial. So even though the code is straightforward, it's optimal.

No need for any other data structures. The Counter is efficient enough here. So the code is as written.

So the code is:

Read n, read list.

Count frequencies.

Sum the pairs for each frequency.

Divide sum by 2.

Output the result.

Yes. That's the correct solution.
