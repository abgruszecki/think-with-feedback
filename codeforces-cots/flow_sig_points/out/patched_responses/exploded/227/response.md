Okay, let's see. We need to find the minimum number of operations to type a string where the allowed operations are adding a character or, at most once, copying the entire current string and appending it. So, the challenge is to find the best place where a copy can save steps.

First, the idea is that the copy operation doubles the current string. So, for example, if after building a string of length k, you copy it, you get 2k. But this only works if the copied part matches the subsequent characters in the target string. So the problem is to find the largest possible substring that can be formed by such a copy, thereby saving the maximum number of steps.

Let me think: for each possible position in the string, check if the substring up to that position can be a candidate for a copy. The maximum possible copy would be when the current string is s[0...i], and then the next i+1 characters (from i+1 to 2i+1) are exactly s[0...i]. Then, after the copy, the length becomes 2i+2, but wait, no. Wait, the copy appends the same string. So if the current string is of length k, after copy it's 2k. So for the copy to be possible, the next k characters in the target string must match the first k characters. So, the optimal approach is to find the maximum possible k such that there exists a position in the string where the next k characters after position k are exactly the same as the first k characters. Then, using a copy here would save k operations (since instead of adding k characters, we do one copy).

So, for example, in the first example abcabca:

The initial string is abc (length 3). Then, copying gives abcabc (length 6). Then add 'a' once. Total steps: 3 (type abc) +1 (copy) +1 (add a) =5. So the copy here is done after building abc. The next three characters (positions 3-5) are 'abc', which matches the first three. So that's why the copy is possible.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate over all possible positions where the copy could be applied. For each possible split point, check if the string from that point can be formed by a copy of a previous substring.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible k is the largest possible such that the substring s[0..k-1] is equal to s[k..2k-1], and 2k-1 is less than n. Then, the copy would allow us to reach position 2k-1 with k+1 operations: k steps to build the initial, then one copy. Then the remaining characters would be added normally.

But how do we find the best possible k?

The approach would be to check for the maximum possible k where the string can be split into a prefix that can be copied. So, for each possible k, check if the substring starting at k is the same as the first k characters. Then, the maximum such k would give the maximum possible savings.

So for each possible k from n//2 down to 1, check if the string starts with a substring of length k, followed by another substring of length k. Then, the maximum k would be the best possible.

Wait, but the copy can be done at any point. For example, the first example: the copy is done after building the first 3 characters. Then the next 3 characters are abc, so after copying, you have 6 characters. Then the remaining is 'a' (7th character). So in this case, the copy is applied when the current string is of length 3. So the copy doubles it to 6. Then add one more character.

But perhaps the maximum possible k is the largest possible where the first 2k characters are made up of two copies of the first k. Then, for that k, the number of operations would be k (to type first k) + 1 (copy) + (n-2k) (remaining steps). If 2k is more than n, then that's not possible. So the maximum possible k is the largest k where 2k <=n, and s[0..k-1] == s[k..2k-1]. For that k, the total operations would be k + 1 + (n - 2k) = n -k +1.

But if there are multiple possible k's, we need the largest one, since n -k +1 would be minimized when k is as large as possible.

So the algorithm would be:

- Iterate k from the maximum possible (n//2) down to 1.

- For each k, check if s[0:k] == s[k:2k]. If yes, then this is the best possible k. The minimum operations would be k +1 + (n-2k) = n -k +1.

- If no such k exists, then the minimum operations is n (since no copy can be used).

So the steps are:

1. Find the maximum k where 2k <=n and s starts with s[0:k] repeated twice.

2. Then compute the minimal steps as (k +1) + (n-2k) = n -k +1.

3. If no such k exists, then the minimal steps is n.

Wait, but what if there's a k where 2k is more than n but part of the second copy is in the string?

No, because for the copy to be possible, after the copy, the entire string up to 2k must be covered. So the maximum possible k is n//2.

Wait, for example, in the case of 'aaaaa', n=5. Then the maximum possible k is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Then s[0:2] is 'aa', s[2:4] is 'aa'. So then the copy can be done here. So the steps would be 2 (type 'aa') +1 (copy) +1 (add 'a') = 4 steps.

But wait, after copy, the string becomes 'aaaa', and then add 'a' for the fifth character. So total 2+1+1=4, which is 5 -2 +1 =4.

Yes.

Another example: the second test case input is 'abcdefgh' with length 8. So possible k's are up to 4 (since 2*4=8). Check if s[0:4] is 'abcd' and s[4:8] is 'efgh'. So they are not equal. So no k found. So steps are 8.

So the algorithm would be correct.

So the plan is:

- For each possible k from (n//2) down to 1:

   Check if s starts with s[0:k] *2 (i.e., the first 2k characters are two copies of s[0:k]).

- The first such k found (the largest possible) gives the maximum possible k.

- Then the minimal steps are (k + 1) + (n - 2k) = n -k +1.

- If no such k exists, then steps are n.

So now, how to implement this?

In Python, for each k in range (max_k, 0, -1), check if s[:k] == s[k:2k].

But wait, for example, when n is 7 as in the first example, the maximum k is 3 (since 2*3=6 <=7). Then s[0:3] is 'abc', s[3:6] is 'abc'. So the check is True. So steps would be 7 -3 +1 =5, which is correct.

So code steps:

Read n and s.

max_k = n//2

for k in range(max_k, 0, -1):

    if 2*k <=n and s[:k] == s[k:2*k]:

        answer = (k) +1 + (n-2*k)

        print(answer)

        exit()

print(n)

Wait, but what about when the entire string is made of two copies of a substring, but longer than n//2?

Wait, no. Because the maximum k where 2k <=n is n//2. So for even n, it's exactly n/2, for odd it's (n-1)/2.

So the code would correctly find the maximum possible k.

Wait, let's test the example where the string is 'aaaaa' (n=5). The maximum k is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Then s[:2] is 'aa', s[2:4] is 'aa'. So the code returns 5-2 +1 =4 steps. Which is correct.

Another example: 'aaaa' (n=4). k=2. s[:2] is 'aa', s[2:4] is 'aa' â†’ steps 4-2+1=3 steps. Which is correct: type 'aa' (2 steps), copy (1 step) â†’ total 3 steps.

Another case: 'a' (n=1). max_k is 0, loop doesn't run. So answer is 1.

So code works.

But wait, the loop is from k in range(max_k, 0, -1):

Wait, when n=5, max_k is 5//2=2. So range(2,0,-1) gives 2,1.

For each k=2, check s[:2] == s[2:4]. Then, yes. So answer is 5-2+1=4.

If for example, the string is 'aaaab', n=5. Then the maximum k is 2. s[:2] is 'aa', s[2:4] is 'aa' â†’ yes. So steps 5-2+1=4. But the string is 'aaaa b'? Wait, no, in this case, the first 4 characters are 'aaaa', but the code would copy after k=2, so the first 2 'aa' and copy gives 'aaaa', then add 'b' â†’ total 2+1 +1=4 steps. But the string would be 'aaaaa'? Hmm, maybe not. But in this example, the code works as intended.

So the code seems correct.

Now, let's see edge cases.

Case 1: All characters are same. For example, n=4. Then the maximum k is 2. So steps 2+1 +0=3. Which is correct.

Case 2: n=3. Then maximum k is 1. So check s[0] == s[1]. If not, check k=1. If s[0] == s[1], then steps would be 1+1 + (3-2) =1+1+1=3. But typing all 3 steps would be 3. So only if the first two characters are same and third is same as first.

Wait, no. For example, if s is 'aab'. Then k=1: s[0] is 'a', s[1] is 'a'. So copy after 'a' (length 1) gives 'aa' (length 2). Then add 'b'. Steps:1 +1 +1=3. But original is 'aab' (length 3). So yes.

But if the string is 'aaa' (n=3), then k=1. s[0:1] is 'a', s[1:2] is 'a'. So steps 1+1 +1=3. But perhaps a better way is to type 'a' once, then copy (length 2), then add 'a' once. So steps 1+1+1=3. Or, alternatively, maybe a larger k. Wait, for n=3, the maximum k is 1 (since 2k=2<=3). So no larger k possible.

So code works.

Another example: n=6, string 'abcabc'. Then k=3. s[:3] is 'abc', s[3:6] is 'abc' â†’ yes. Steps 3+1 +0=4 steps, which is better than 6.

So code works.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, implement this.

The code will:

Read n and s.

max_k = n // 2

Loop k from max_k down to 1:

    Check if 2k <= n (which it is, since k <= max_k â†’ 2k <= n)

    Check s[:k] == s[k:2*k]

If found, compute answer as (k) +1 + (n - 2k) â†’ which simplifies to (n -k +1)

Print that and exit.

Else, after loop, print n.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    max_k = n // 2

    for k in range(max_k, 0, -1):
        if s[:k] == s[k:2*k]:
            print(n - k +1, file=output_stream)
            return

    print(n, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
8
abcdefgh
""",
            "output": \
"""\
8
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second example: n=8, s=abcdefgh.

max_k=4. Check k=4: s[0:4] is 'abcd', s[4:8] is 'efgh' â†’ not same. Then k=3: s[0:3] is 'abc', s[3:6] is 'def' â†’ not same. Then k=2: 'ab' vs 'cd' â†’ no. k=1: 'a' vs 'b' â†’ no. So no copy possible. Answer is 8.

Another test case: n=4, s=aaaa â†’ answer is 3 (k=2, 2+1 steps).

Another case: n=5, s=aaaaa â†’ answer is 4 (k=2: 2+1 +1=4).

All correct.

So the code is correct.

```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

max_k = n // 2

for k in range(max_k, 0, -1):
    if s[:k] == s[k:2*k]:
        print(n - k + 1)
        exit()
        
print(n)
```
