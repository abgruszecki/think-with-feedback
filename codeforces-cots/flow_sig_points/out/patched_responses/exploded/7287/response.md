<think>
Okay, let's see. We need to find the minimum number of changes so that the temperature sequence first has some negative days, then positive days. And no zeros allowed. So, the sequence must start with a bunch of negatives, then switch to positives, and all of them must be non-zero. 

Hmm. The problem is similar to finding a split point k (between 1 and n-1) such that all elements before k+1 are negative, and all elements after (including k+1) are positive. Then, for each possible split point k, compute the number of elements that need to be changed. The minimal such number across all possible k's is the answer.

Wait, right. Because the split k can be anywhere between 1 and n-1. For each possible k, we check how many elements in the first k days are not negative (so need to be changed to negative) plus the number of elements from k+1 to n that are not positive (changed to positive). Then find the minimum of these sums over all possible k.

So the approach would be:

1. Precompute two arrays:
   - left_neg: left_neg[i] is the number of changes needed for the first i days to be all negative (i.e., count of non-negative elements in the first i days).
   - right_pos: right_pos[j] is the number of changes needed for days j to n to be all positive (count of non-positive elements from j to n).

2. Then, for each possible k (from 1 to n-1), the total changes needed would be left_neg[k] + right_pos[k+1].

3. The minimal such sum is the answer.

Yes. Now, how to compute left_neg and right_pos efficiently?

Let's think. For left_neg:

left_neg[i] represents the number of elements in the first i days that are >=0 (since they need to be changed to negative). So for each day from 1 to i, count how many are not negative.

Similarly, right_pos[j] is the number of elements from day j to n that are <=0 (since they need to be changed to positive). For each day from j to n, count how many are not positive.

We can precompute these using prefix sums.

For example, create a prefix array where each element is 1 if the original element is >=0, else 0. Then the prefix sum up to i gives left_neg[i].

Similarly, create a suffix array where each element is 1 if the original element is <=0, else 0. The suffix sum from j to end gives right_pos[j].

So precompute these prefix and suffix sums.

Once we have these arrays, iterate through all possible k (from 1 to n-1), compute left_neg[k] + right_pos[k+1], and take the minimum.

That's the plan. Now let's think about the implementation.

First, read n, then the list of temperatures.

Compute the prefix array for left_neg. left_neg[i] is sum of (t >=0 ? 1 :0) for the first i elements.

Wait, but in Python, indexes are 0-based. So let's adjust.

Suppose the input list is t[0], t[1], ..., t[n-1].

For the prefix array:

prefix = [0]*(n+1)
prefix[0] = 0
for i from 1 to n:
   prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + (t[i-1] >= 0)

So prefix[i] is the number of elements in the first i days (indices 0 to i-1) that are >=0. So for a split k (number of days in the first part being k days), left_neg[k] is prefix[k].

Similarly, the suffix array:

suffix = [0]*(n+2)
for j from n downto 1:
   suffix[j] = suffix[j+1] + (t[j-1] <=0)

Because suffix[j] is the number of elements from j to n (indices j-1 to n-1) that are <=0. So for the second part starting at j = k+1 (after split k), right_pos[j] is suffix[j].

So for each possible split k (1<=k<=n-1), the required changes are prefix[k] + suffix[k+1].

We need to find the minimal value of this sum over all k.

Yes.

Now, the edge cases. What if all elements are already in the required form? Then the answer is 0. But we need to make sure that the split exists, i.e., that there is some k where the first k are all negative and the rest positive. Otherwise, even if all are negative or all positive, the answer would be impossible (but according to the problem statement, the split must exist, so if all are negative, then the answer would be invalid unless there's a split. But according to the problem, the split must have some days in each part. So if all days are negative except the last, then for k =n-1, the first n-1 days are negative and the last day is positive. But if all are negative, then there's no possible split. So the code must account for all possibilities.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the split must have at least one day in each part. So k can be from 1 to n-1. So in code, we need to check all possible splits between 1 and n-1. For example, if all elements are negative except the last, then k =n-1 would have left_neg[k] being the count of non-negative in first n-1 days (which is zero if all are negative except the last). But that's not the case. Wait, let's see.

If the first n-1 days are all negative, then prefix[n-1] is zero. The last day (n-th day) must be positive. So suffix[n] is (t[n-1] <=0 ? 1 :0). If the last day is positive, suffix[n] is zero. So the sum is 0+0=0. So if the sequence already meets the condition, the code would find the sum zero.

So the code should handle that.

So the steps are:

- Compute prefix array, which for each i (1<=i<=n) gives the number of elements in the first i elements (0 to i-1) that are >=0.

- Compute suffix array, which for each j (1<=j<=n) gives the number of elements from j to n (j-1 to n-1) that are <=0.

- Iterate k from 1 to n-1, compute prefix[k] + suffix[k+1]. The minimal such sum is the answer.

If there are no possible splits (n=0?), but according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So n will be >=2. So the code must process all k from 1 to n-1.

So, the code would look like:

Read n.

t = list of integers.

Compute prefix:

prefix = [0]*(n+1)
for i in range(1, n+1):
    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + (t[i-1] >=0)

Compute suffix:

suffix = [0]*(n+2)
for j in range(n, 0, -1):
    suffix[j] = suffix[j+1] + (t[j-1] <=0)

Then, the answer is the minimum of prefix[k] + suffix[k+1] for k in 1..n-1.

But wait, how about when the initial array has zeros? For example, in the sample input 2, there's a zero. The problem statement says that the sequence must have no zeros. So even if a split point is chosen, any zeros in the first part must be changed (as the first part must be all negatives), and any zeros in the second part must be changed (as they must be positives). So the code's approach of counting >=0 in the first part (including zeros) and <=0 (including zeros) in the second part is correct. Because any zero in the first part would need to be changed to a negative (so counted in prefix), and zeros in the second part need to be changed to positive (counted in suffix).

So the code correctly counts the required changes.

Now, testing on the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:
4
-1 1 -2 1

So t is [-1,1,-2,1]

prefix array:

prefix[0] =0.

i=1: t[0] is -1 <0 → add 0 → prefix[1] =0.

i=2: t[1] is 1 >=0 → add 1 → prefix[2]=1.

i=3: t[2] is -2 <0 → prefix[3] =1.

i=4: t[3] is 1 >=0 → prefix[4]=2.

suffix array:

j=4: t[3] is 1 <=0? 0 → suffix[4] =0 + suffix[5] (0) → 0.

j=3: t[2] is -2 <=0 → 1 + suffix[4] (0) →1.

j=2: t[1] is 1 <=0 →0 + suffix[3] (1) →1.

j=1: t[0] is -1 <=0 →1 + suffix[2] (1) →2.

So suffix is:

suffix[1] =2, suffix[2]=1, suffix[3]=1, suffix[4]=0.

Now, for each k from 1 to 3:

k=1:

prefix[1] is 0. suffix[2] is 1. sum 0+1=1.

k=2:

prefix[2] is1. suffix[3] is1. sum 2.

k=3:

prefix[3] is1. suffix[4] is0. sum 1+0=1.

The minimum is 1. Which matches the sample output.

Sample 2:

Input:
5
0 -1 1 2 -5

t = [0, -1, 1, 2, -5]

Compute prefix:

prefix[1] = 0 >=0 →1.

prefix[2] =0 (t[0] is 0, yes, so prefix[2] =1 (0 is >=0) + t[1] is -1 <0 →0. Wait no.

Wait, for each i in 1 to 5:

i=1: t[0] is 0 → >=0 →1. prefix[1] =1.

i=2: t[1] is -1 <0 → add 0. So prefix[2] =1+0=1.

i=3: t[2] is1 >=0 →1. prefix[3] =1+1=2.

i=4: t[3] is2 >=0 → prefix[4] =2+1=3.

i=5: t[4] is-5 <0 → prefix[5] =3+0=3.

Suffix array:

j from 5 down to 1.

j=5: t[4] is-5 <=0 →1. suffix[5] =1 + suffix[6] (0) →1.

j=4: t[3] is2 <=0? No. →0. suffix[4] =0 + suffix[5] (1) →1.

j=3: t[2] is1 <=0? No. →0. suffix[3] =0 +1 →1.

j=2: t[1] is-1 <=0 →1. suffix[2] =1 + suffix[3] (1) →2.

j=1: t[0] is0 <=0 →1. suffix[1] =1 + suffix[2] (2) →3.

Now, for k from 1 to4:

k=1:

prefix[1] =1. suffix[2] =2. sum=3.

k=2: prefix[2]=1, suffix[3] =1 →2.

k=3: prefix[3]=2, suffix[4]=1 →3.

k=4: prefix[4] =3, suffix[5]=1 →3+1=4.

The minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output.

So the code works for the samples.

Now, edge cases.

Test case where all elements are positive except the first. For example, n=2, elements [-1, 1]. Then split at k=1. prefix[1] is 0 (since first element is -1). suffix[2] is 0 (since second element is 1>0. So sum 0. So answer is 0. Correct.

Another test case where all elements are negative. Then for any split k (1<=k <=n-1), the second part (k+1 to n) must be positive, but they are all negative. So suffix[k+1] would be the count of <=0 elements, which is (n -k) elements. So for example, n=3, all elements -1, -2, -3. For k=1, suffix[2] would be 2 elements (t[1] and t[2] are <=0, so 2. So sum is prefix[1] (0) + 2 →2. For k=2: suffix[3] is 1. sum is prefix[2] (0) +1=1. So minimal sum is 1. So the answer is 1. Which would require changing the last element to positive.

Another case: all elements are positive. Then, for any split k, the first part (k elements) must be negative. So the sum is prefix[k] (k elements, all positive, so k) + suffix[k+1] (0, since all are positive). So the minimal sum is when k is 1: sum is 1 (prefix[1] is 1) +0. But for k=1, the sum is 1. So answer is 1. Which would require changing the first element to negative.

Another case: all elements are zero. Then, for any split, the first part must be negative, so all zeros in the first k must be changed (k changes), and the second part must be positive, so all zeros (n-k) changes. So the sum is k + (n-k) =n. For n=5, sum is 5. So the minimal sum is 5. But possible splits are 1 to 4. So the answer is 5, which is correct. For example, changing first 1 to negative (1 change), and rest 4 to positive (4 changes). Total 5.

Now, in code, for each split k, the sum is prefix[k] + suffix[k+1]. So the code would correctly compute all these possibilities.

Now, the code needs to handle n up to 1e5, which is acceptable. The prefix and suffix arrays are O(n) in space, which is acceptable for 1e5 elements.

Time complexity is O(n) for building the arrays, then O(n) to iterate through all k. So overall O(n), which is acceptable for 1e5.

So the code should be efficient.

Now, implement this in Python.

But note that in Python, building the prefix and suffix arrays can be done efficiently.

Let's proceed.

Read n, then the list t.

Compute prefix:

prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n+1):
    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + (t[i-1] >= 0)

Compute suffix:

suffix = [0] * (n + 2)
for j in range(n, 0, -1):
    suffix[j] = suffix[j+1] + (t[j-1] <= 0)

Then, compute the minimum between prefix[k] + suffix[k+1] for k in 1..n-1.

If n is 1, but according to the constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    t = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    prefix = [0]*(n+1)
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + (t[i-1] >=0)

    suffix = [0]*(n+2)
    for j in range(n, 0, -1):
        suffix[j] = suffix[j+1] + (t[j-1] <=0)

    min_changes = float('inf')
    for k in range(1, n):
        current = prefix[k] + suffix[k+1]
        if current < min_changes:
            min_changes = current

    print(min_changes, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
5
0 -1 1 2 -5
""",
            "output": \
"""\
2
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 2:

n=5.

t is [0, -1, 1, 2, -5]

prefix[1] =0 >=0 → yes (0 is >=0) →1.

prefix[2] =1 + (-1 >=0? no →0) →1.

prefix[3] =1 +1 (1 >=0) →2.

prefix[4] =2 +2>=0 →yes →3.

prefix[5] =3 + (-5 >=0 → no →3.

suffix:

j=5: t[4] is-5 <=0 → yes →1. suffix[5] =1.

j=4: t[3]=2 <=0 →no →0. suffix[4] =0 +1 →1.

j=3: t[2]=1 <=0 →no →0. suffix[3] =0 +1 →1.

j=2: t[1] =-1 <=0 →yes →1. suffix[2] =1 +1 →2.

j=1: t[0]=0 <=0 →yes →1. suffix[1] =1 +2 →3.

Then, possible k:1,2,3,4.

k=1: prefix[1] =1. suffix[2] =2 →3.

k=2: prefix[2] =1. suffix[3] =1 →2.

So the minimal is 2.

So code works.

Now, code needs to handle all cases. So this should be correct.
