Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of possible polylines that represent camels with exactly t humps. Let's read the problem carefully again.

The problem states that a camel's polyline has n vertices. The x-coordinates are fixed as 1, 2, ..., n. The y-coordinates must meet several conditions:

1. Exactly t humps. A hump is a point j (2 ≤ j ≤ n-1) where y_{j-1} < y_j > y_{j+1}.
2. Exactly t-1 dips. A dip is a point j where y_{j-1} > y_j < y_{j+1}.
3. No segment is horizontal. So, consecutive y's must be different.
4. All y_i are integers between 1 and 4, inclusive.

The task is to compute how many such sequences of y_i exist for given n and t.

Hmm. So, for each possible sequence of y's (each being 1-4), check all these conditions. But with n up to 20, the total possibilities could be 4^20, which is way too big to brute force. So a brute force approach is impossible. We need a dynamic programming approach.

First, let's model the problem. We can model it as a state transition problem where each state depends on the previous steps. The key is to track the necessary information as we build the sequence step by step.

Let's think about what we need to track at each step:

- The current position (i-th point, from 1 to n).
- The previous two y values. Because for the next step, when adding a new y, we can check the previous two to determine if there's a hump or dip at position j-1 (since j is in the middle of three points).
- The counts of humps and dips so far. Because we need to end up with exactly t humps and t-1 dips.

Wait, but when we are building the sequence up to i, the humps and dips are determined by the previous points. For example, when we add the i-th y, the (i-1)th position (j = i-1) can be a hump or dip if i-1 is between 2 and n-1. So, for each step, when we add a new y, we can check the previous two (i-2, i-1, i) and determine if a hump or dip was added at position i-1.

So, the state for dynamic programming could be:

- The position i (current length of the sequence).
- The previous two y values (since the next y's effect on humps/dips depends on the previous two).
- The current count of humps and dips.

So the state transitions would be: for each possible state (i, y_prev_prev, y_prev, humps, dips), and for each possible next y (from 1-4, but y_prev != y_next to avoid horizontal segments), compute if adding y_next would create a hump or dip at position i (which is j = i in the problem's terms, but since we are building up to i+1, perhaps I need to think carefully about indices).

Wait, the positions are 1-based. Let's say we have built up to position i. The next position is i+1. When we add y_{i+1}, then the triplet (i-1, i, i+1) would have j = i. So, for each step, when adding the (i+1)th y, we can check if j = i (which is in 2..n-1) meets the conditions for a hump or dip.

Wait, j can be 2 ≤ j ≤ n-1. So when building the sequence up to length i (points 1 to i), the positions j that are considered for humps and dips are 2 ≤ j ≤ i-1. So when adding the i-th point (i >=3), we can check j = i-1 (since i-1 must be between 2 and i-1 <= n-1). Wait, no. For example, when building the sequence up to i=3 (points 1,2,3), then j=2 is checked. So when adding the third point, we can check j=2. Similarly, when adding the fourth point (i=4), we check j=3, but only if i=4 is <=n (so j=3 must be <=n-1).

So, the process is:

For each step, when adding the i-th y (so after the step, the sequence has i elements), the previous elements are 1 to i. Then, any j between 2 and i-1 (if i-1 >=2) can be checked. But when building the sequence step by step, the only new j that could be added as a hump or dip is j = i-1, because when we add the i-th element, the triplet (i-2, i-1, i) is formed, allowing us to check j = i-1.

So, for the dynamic programming state, each time we add a new y, we can check if the current triplet (the last three y's) forms a hump or dip. Therefore, the state must track the last two y values (y_prev_prev and y_prev), the current counts of humps and dips, and the current position.

So the state can be represented as:

dp[i][a][b][h][d] = number of ways to reach position i with the last two y values being a and b, having accumulated h humps and d dips.

The transitions would be: for each possible next y value c (not equal to b to avoid horizontal segments), check if the triplet (a, b, c) forms a hump, a dip, or neither. Then, update h and d accordingly.

But what are the conditions for a hump or dip in the triplet (a, b, c):

Hump: a < b > c → then, when adding c (i-th position), j = i-1 (since a is at i-2, b at i-1, c at i). But j must be ≥ 2 and ≤ n-1. So when adding the i-th element, j = i-1 must be between 2 and n-1. So for j to be valid, i-1 must be ≥2 → i ≥3. Also, i-1 must ≤n-1 → i ≤n. So when i is from 3 up to n, each step when adding the i-th element (so building up to i), the j=i-1 is checked only if i <=n. Wait, when i is 3, j=2 is valid (since 2 <=n-1 as n >=3). So during the transitions, when building up to i, when i >=3, we check j = i-1 (which is j >=2 and j <=n-1 if i <=n).

But during the process of building the sequence, when adding the i-th element (so building up to i elements), j = i-1 is considered as a possible hump or dip only if i-1 is between 2 and n-1. So for i=2 (the sequence has two elements), we can't form a triplet. For i >=3, we can check the triplet (i-2, i-1, i). However, j = i-1 must be <=n-1. So for i-1 <=n-1 → i <=n. So when i <=n, the triplet (i-2, i-1, i) is part of the sequence, and j=i-1 is a valid position (if i-1 >=2). So, during the transitions, for each i >=3, but only up to i <=n, we check if the triplet (a, b, c) (the last three elements) forms a hump or dip. But for i= n+1, which is beyond the sequence length, so that's not possible.

Wait, the sequence has exactly n elements, so when i reaches n, that's the end.

So, the dynamic programming approach would proceed as follows:

Initialize the DP with possible starting sequences. For the first two elements (i=2), we can have any two different y values (since no horizontal segments allowed). For each possible pair (y1, y2), where y1 and y2 are in 1-4 and y1 != y2. The counts of humps and dips are zero because we need three elements to form a hump or dip.

Then, for each i from 3 to n:

For each possible state (i-1, a, b, h, d), and for each possible next y = c (different from b), check if adding c would create a hump, dip, or nothing at j = i-1 (which is the current i-1, since after adding c, the sequence is up to i elements, and j = i-1 is part of the sequence if j >=2 and <=n-1. But j = i-1 must be <=n-1. But since i is up to n, j = i-1 can be up to n-1. So for all i from 3 to n, the j is valid (as i-1 >=2 when i >=3, and i-1 <=n-1 when i <=n).

So, for each transition from (a, b) to c:

- Check if a < b and b > c → then it's a hump. So h increases by 1.
- Check if a > b and b < c → then it's a dip. So d increases by 1.
- Otherwise, no change to h and d.

But we must ensure that by the end of the sequence (i=n), the total humps are exactly t and dips are exactly t-1.

So, the DP state will track the number of humps and dips up to the current position. Then, for each state, when adding a new y, we compute the new h and d.

Now, the question is: how to model the DP with the parameters (i, a, b, h, d), where a is y_{i-2}, b is y_{i-1}, and then the next y is c (y_i). Wait, when i is the current length of the sequence, then a is the (i-2)th element, b is (i-1)th, and c is the ith. But for transitions, when i increases to i+1, the new a becomes b, the new b becomes c, etc.

So the state for the DP can be represented as:

- The current position i (from 2 to n)
- The previous two y values (a, b)
- The current count of humps (h)
- The current count of dips (d)

The transitions would be for each possible next y (c) that is not equal to b (since consecutive y's must be different). For each such c, we check if the triplet (a, b, c) forms a hump, dip, or neither, and update h and d accordingly.

But when i is 2, we can't form any triplet. So, the initial states are for i=2, with a being the first y (y1) and b being the second y (y2). But since a is the first element, when i=2, the previous two y values are a and b. Wait, no: for i=2, the sequence has two elements, so the previous two are y1 and y2. Then, when i=3, adding y3, the triplet is y1, y2, y3. Then, when i=4, the triplet for j=3 is y2, y3, y4.

So, the state transitions would track the last two y's, because when adding a new y, the previous two are needed to check for a hump or dip.

Now, the problem is to model this state and transitions efficiently, considering that the parameters can vary within manageable ranges.

Let's calculate the possible dimensions for the DP:

- i ranges from 2 to n (max 20)
- a and b can be from 1 to 4 (so 4*4=16 possible combinations)
- h can be up to t (since we need exactly t humps). Since t can be up to 10.
- d can be up to t-1 (since the required dips are t-1).

But wait, h can't exceed t, and d can't exceed t-1. So the DP can track h up to t, and d up to t-1. Any state that exceeds these can be ignored.

So the total number of states is O(n * 4 * 4 * t * (t-1))). For n=20, t=10, this is 20 * 16 * 10 *9 = 20*16*90= 28,800. Which is manageable.

So this is feasible.

The base case is i=2, with a and b being any two distinct values (since consecutive y's can't be equal). For each possible pair (a, b) where a != b, the initial state is (i=2, a, b, h=0, d=0). The count for each such state is 1.

Then, for each i from 3 to n:

For each possible state (i-1, a_prev, b_prev, h_prev, d_prev), and for each possible next y c (not equal to b_prev):

Compute whether adding c creates a hump or dip at j = i-1 (since a_prev is i-2, b_prev is i-1, c is i).

If the triplet (a_prev, b_prev, c) is a hump, then h_new = h_prev + 1. But we need to check if this is allowed (h_new <= t). Similarly, if it's a dip, d_new = d_prev +1 (must be <= t-1). Otherwise, h and d remain the same.

So for each transition, we calculate the new h and d, and check if they are within the allowed limits (h <= t, d <= t-1). If they are, then we add the number of ways from the previous state to the new state.

At the end (i =n), we sum all states where h == t, d == t-1.

So the steps are:

1. Initialize the DP for i=2 with all possible a, b (a, b from 1-4, a != b), h=0, d=0. Each has a count of 1.

2. For each i from 3 to n:

   a. For each state in the previous DP (i-1):

      i. For each possible next y c (1-4, c != b_prev):

         - Check the triplet (a_prev, b_prev, c) for hump or dip.

         - Update h and d accordingly.

         - If h exceeds t or d exceeds t-1, skip.

         - Add to the new DP state (i, b_prev, c, new_h, new_d) the count from the previous state.

3. After processing all i up to n, sum all DP states where i == n, h == t, d == t-1.

But how to handle the triplet check?

Let's code that as:

is_hump = (a_prev < b_prev) and (b_prev > c)

is_dip = (a_prev > b_prev) and (b_prev < c)

Then, if is_hump, new_h = h_prev +1. Else new_h = h_prev.

Similarly for dip.

But also, we need to ensure that when we add this hump or dip, j (i-1) is a valid position, i.e., 2 <= j <= n-1. Wait, j is i-1. When i ranges from 3 to n, j ranges from 2 to n-1. Which is exactly the required j's (2 <= j <=n-1). So all humps and dips added in these steps are valid.

So during the transitions, whenever a hump or dip is detected, it's a valid one.

Now, the code structure:

We can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries or a 5-dimensional array. But given the parameters (i up to 20, a and b up to 4, h up to 10, d up to 9), using a dictionary for each step might be manageable. Alternatively, using a 5-dimensional array, but in Python, perhaps using nested dictionaries for each i.

But for efficiency, perhaps using a 4-dimensional dictionary (a, b, h, d) for each i.

So for each step i, the DP can be represented as a dictionary where the keys are tuples (a_prev, b_prev, h, d) and the value is the count. Then, for each transition, we process each key and generate new keys for the next step.

Alternatively, for each i, we can have a dictionary that maps (a, b, h, d) to counts.

Let me outline the code steps:

Initialize:

dp_prev is the DP for i=2.

For each possible a in 1-4:

   for each possible b in 1-4:

       if a != b:

           dp_prev[(a, b, 0, 0)] = 1

Then, for i from 3 to n:

   dp_current = defaultdict(int)

   for (a_prev, b_prev, h_prev, d_prev), count in dp_prev.items():

       for c in 1-4:

           if c == b_prev:

               continue  # skip horizontal segments

           # Check if triplet a_prev, b_prev, c is a hump or dip

           is_hump = (a_prev < b_prev) and (b_prev > c)

           is_dip = (a_prev > b_prev) and (b_prev < c)

           new_h = h_prev + (1 if is_hump else 0)

           new_d = d_prev + (1 if is_dip else 0)

           # Check if new_h and new_d are within allowed limits

           if new_h > t or new_d > t-1:

               continue

           # Update the new state (b_prev, c, new_h, new_d) in dp_current

           key = (b_prev, c, new_h, new_d)

           dp_current[key] += count

   dp_prev = dp_current

After processing all i up to n, sum all the counts in dp_prev where h == t and d == t-1.

But wait, when i is n, the current states are for i=n, and the keys are (a, b, h, d). So the sum would be over all (a, b) where h == t and d == t-1.

So the final answer is the sum of counts for all entries in dp_prev where h == t and d == t-1.

Now, what about the case where n=3, t=1. Then, after i=3, the j=2 is checked, which must be a hump. And there must be zero dips (since t-1=0). So the code would accumulate the states where h=1 and d=0.

Yes.

Testing the first example:

Input: 6 1 → output 6.

So n=6, t=1. So the sequence must have exactly 1 hump and 0 dips. Wait no, the problem says:

there should be exactly t humps and t-1 dips. So for t=1, t-1=0. So the code is correct.

In the first sample, the output is 6. So the code must compute 6 sequences.

Let's see how that would happen. The sample sequences have 6 elements. Let's think: each sequence has exactly one hump (so one triplet where yj-1 < yj > yj+1), and zero dips.

So, during the transitions, whenever a hump is added, h increases by 1, and dips can't exceed 0.

So the code correctly captures that.

Now, let's think about the DP steps for the first example. The code should process each step, and for each possible state, track h and d.

Now, the code's initial step for i=2: all possible a, b pairs where a != b, h=0, d=0. For n=6, t=1. Then, for each subsequent i (3 to 6), the code builds the DP states.

At each step, transitions are made, and humps and dips are counted.

In the first example, the code must end up with 6 possible sequences. So the code should correctly track that.

Now, code optimization:

In Python, using a dictionary for each step and iterating through all possible states would be manageable for n up to 20 and t up to 10, as the state space is small.

But using a defaultdict for dp_prev and dp_current would be efficient. For each step, for each possible state, and for each possible next c (3 possibilities, since c can't be equal to b_prev), we generate new states.

Another optimization: since a_prev and b_prev are from 1-4, and c is from 1-4 (excluding b_prev), the possible c's are 3 per transition.

But in code, for each possible c in 1-4, check if c != b_prev.

So, the code would look something like this:

Read n and t.

if t ==0, then the problem requires 0 humps and -1 dips, which is impossible, but according to the constraints, t >=1. So no need to handle that.

Initialize the DP:

from collections import defaultdict

prev_dp = defaultdict(int)

for a in range(1,5):

    for b in range(1,5):

        if a != b:

            prev_dp[(a, b, 0, 0)] +=1

Then, for each i in 3 to n:

current_dp = defaultdict(int)

for (a_prev, b_prev, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items():

    for c in range(1,5):

        if c == b_prev:

            continue

        # Check if the triplet a_prev, b_prev, c is hump or dip

        is_hump = (a_prev < b_prev) and (b_prev > c)

        is_dip = (a_prev > b_prev) and (b_prev < c)

        new_h = h + (1 if is_hump else 0)

        new_d = d + (1 if is_dip else 0)

        if new_h > t or new_d > (t-1):

            continue

        # the new state's previous two are b_prev and c

        current_dp[ (b_prev, c, new_h, new_d) ] += cnt

prev_dp = current_dp

At the end:

result = sum( cnt for (a, b, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items() if h == t and d == t-1 )

print(result)

But wait, in the final state, the last two y's are a and b. But for the sequence to have n elements, the a and b in the final state correspond to the (n-1)th and nth elements. But those don't affect the count of humps and dips, since j must be up to n-1. So the code correctly ignores the last two y's in the final count, as they don't form a new triplet (since adding the nth element would only check j =n-1, which is allowed).

Now, let's test the code against the first sample input:

n=6, t=1.

After processing i=6, the code sums all the states where h=1 and d=0.

Let's see how that happens.

The sample's output is 6. Let's see if the code would count that.

But how? Let's imagine the possible sequences. Each has exactly one hump and zero dips.

So during transitions, when a hump is added (h increases by 1), but any dip added would make d exceed 0 (for t=1, allowed d is 0).

So the code would track all possible sequences where exactly one hump occurs, and no dips.

But for the first sample, when n=6, there are 6 possible sequences. So the code's sum is 6.

Another test case: input 4 2 → output 0.

Because for t=2, the number of dips must be 1. But for n=4, possible sequences must have 2 humps and 1 dip. Let's see if that's possible.

But the code would check during transitions and possibly find that it's impossible.

So the code would output 0.

Now, let's think about possible optimizations.

In Python, using defaultdict for each step is efficient, but perhaps using a tuple (a, b, h, d) as the key and counting with integers is manageable.

Another possible optimization is that since a and b are in 1-4, and h and d up to 10 and 9, we can precompute all possible transitions and manage the counts with arrays. But in Python, dictionaries are more flexible and might be faster in practice.

But for n=20 and t=10, the code should run within the time constraints.

Now, let's code this.

But wait, in the code, for each step i, the current_dp is built by iterating through all entries in prev_dp. For each entry, it's possible to generate up to 3 new entries (since c can be 3 possibilities). But with the state space manageable, this should be okay.

Now, code:

Read n and t.

If t is 0, output 0 (but according to constraints, t >=1).

Handle cases where n <3? But the input constraints say n >=3.

But the problem says n >=3.

So code:

n, t = map(int, input().split())

from collections import defaultdict

if t ==0:
    print(0)
    exit()

prev_dp = defaultdict(int)

# Initialize for i=2
for a in range(1,5):
    for b in range(1,5):
        if a != b:
            prev_dp[ (a, b, 0, 0) ] +=1

for i in range(3, n+1):
    current_dp = defaultdict(int)
    for (a_prev, b_prev, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items():
        for c in range(1,5):
            if c == b_prev:
                continue
            is_hump = (a_prev < b_prev) and (b_prev > c)
            is_dip = (a_prev > b_prev) and (b_prev < c)
            new_h = h + (1 if is_hump else 0)
            new_d = d + (1 if is_dip else 0)
            if new_h > t or new_d > (t-1):
                continue
            # Update the new state: (b_prev, c, new_h, new_d)
            current_dp[ (b_prev, c, new_h, new_d) ] += cnt
    prev_dp = current_dp
    # If prev_dp becomes empty, no need to proceed
    if not prev_dp:
        break

# Now sum all states where h == t and d == t-1
result =0
for (a, b, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items():
    if h == t and d == t-1:
        result += cnt

print(result)

This should work. Let's test the first sample input:

Sample 1: n=6, t=1.

The code's result would be 6.

Sample 2: n=4, t=2 → output 0.

Another possible test case: n=3, t=1. The code should count sequences where the middle element is a hump. So for example, sequences like 1,3,2 → which has one hump (3), no dips. So for y1, y2, y3 must be in a pattern where y2 > y1 and y2 > y3. So y2 is the hump.

So possible sequences:

y1 can be 1,2,3 (since y2 can't be higher than 4). For example:

Possible y2 values must be higher than y1 and y3.

So for y1=1, y2 can be 2,3,4. Then y3 can be 1, but less than y2.

Wait, for example:

1-2-1 → valid. But y3 must be different from y2 (2). So 1 is allowed.

Wait, the triplet (y1, y2, y3) must have y1 < y2 > y3. So for each possible triplet where y2 is a peak.

The number of such triplets is:

For each possible y2 (from 2 to 3, since when y2 is 4, the y3 has to be <4, and y1 can be 1,2,3 as long as <4.

Wait, let's compute:

y2 must be >=2 (since y1 must be < y2, and y1 >=1 → the smallest possible y2 is 2).

For y2=2:

y1 can be 1 (since 1 <2).

y3 must be <2 → y3=1.

So possible triplets: (1,2,1). So 1 possibility.

For y2=3:

y1 can be 1,2.

y3 must be <3 → 1 or 2.

So possible triplets:

y1 can be 1 or 2.

For each y1, y3 can be 1 or 2, but y3 must be different from y2 (3) → y3 can be 1 or 2.

But also, the previous elements must be different: between y1 and y2, and between y2 and y3.

So for y2=3:

y1 can be 1 or 2.

For each y1 (1 or 2), y3 can be 1 or 2, but must not equal y2 (3) → allowed. So for each y1:

If y1=1:

y3 can be 1 → but y2=3, so y3=1 is allowed. But the segment from 3 to 1 is allowed (no horizontal). So y3 can be 1, 2.

So two possibilities.

But then the triplet is 1,3,1 → which is a hump (1<3>1). So allowed.

But also, 1,3,2 → 1<3>2. Also allowed.

Similarly, for y1=2: the triplet would be 2,3,1 (2<3>1) → allowed. Or 2,3,2 → which is allowed (3>2), but the segment between 3 and 2 is allowed (not horizontal).

So for y2=3, y1 can be 1 or 2 (2 options), and y3 can be 1 or 2 (2 options each). So 2 * 2 =4.

For y2=4:

y1 can be 1,2,3.

y3 can be 1,2,3.

So for each y1 (1,2,3):

y3 must be <4, so 1,2,3. Also, y3 must be different from y2 (4) → allowed.

So for each y1 in 1,2,3:

y3 can be any of 1,2,3 except whatever is allowed.

But the triplet must be y1 <4 > y3.

So for example, y1=1: 1 <4 > any y3 (1,2,3). But y3 must not be 4 (which it's not). So possible y3: 1,2,3.

But wait, the segment between 4 and y3 must not be horizontal. So y3 can't be 4, which is already handled.

So for y2=4:

y1 can be 1,2,3 (3 options).

y3 can be 1,2,3 (3 options each).

So 3*3=9 possibilities.

So total for y2=2: 1, y2=3: 4, y2=4:9 → total 14.

So for n=3 and t=1, the answer is 14?

But let's see. For example, the triplet (1,3,2) is valid. So the code would count this.

But according to the code, when n=3 and t=1, the code's final sum is 14.

But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

But the code's approach would correctly calculate all possible triplets where exactly one hump exists and zero dips.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.

Thus, the code seems correct.

```python
n, t = map(int, input().split())

from collections import defaultdict

# Early exit if t is 0 (though constraints say t ≥1)
if t == 0:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Initialize DP for i=2
prev_dp = defaultdict(int)
for a in range(1, 5):
    for b in range(1, 5):
        if a != b:
            prev_dp[(a, b, 0, 0)] += 1

# Iterate through each possible i from 3 to n
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    current_dp = defaultdict(int)
    for (a_prev, b_prev, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items():
        for c in range(1, 5):
            if c == b_prev:
                continue  # Skip horizontal segments
            # Check for hump and dip
            is_hump = a_prev < b_prev and b_prev > c
            is_dip = a_prev > b_prev and b_prev < c
            new_h = h + (1 if is_hump else 0)
            new_d = d + (1 if is_dip else 0)
            # Prune impossible states
            if new_h > t or new_d > t - 1:
                continue
            current_dp[(b_prev, c, new_h, new_d)] += cnt
    prev_dp = current_dp
    # Early exit if no possible states left
    if not prev_dp:
        break

# Sum all valid final states
result = 0
for (_, _, h, d), cnt in prev_dp.items():
    if h == t and d == t - 1:
        result += cnt

print(result)
