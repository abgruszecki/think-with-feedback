Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of days the log could have spanned, given that each line is in order and that each timestamp (date:time) can have at most 10 entries. Since the dates are lost, we need to reconstruct the minimal days possible by grouping the times into days, ensuring that no more than 10 entries are in the same minute (considering the same date and time as the same minute). Also, midnight belongs to the next day, so times after 11:59 PM would roll over to the next day's 00:00 AM. 

Hmm, let's break down the problem. Each log entry's time is given in 12-hour format. We need to first convert all these times into a 24-hour format or some sort of minutes-since-midnight to compare them. Wait, but since midnight is part of the next day, that's important. For example, 11:59 PM is the last minute of the current day, and 12:00 AM (midnight) is the next day. So, perhaps we should represent each time as minutes in a 24-hour day. Let's think: for a time like hh:mm x.m., converting to 24-hour time. 

The steps I need to take are:

1. Parse each log entry's time into a minute value. For example, 12:00 AM is 0 minutes (midnight), 1:00 AM is 60, ..., 11:59 AM is 719, 12:00 PM is 720, 1 PM is 780, up to 11:59 PM is 1439. Wait, but 12 PM is noon, so that's 12 hours *60 = 720. And 12 AM is 0. So yes, converting each time to minutes from midnight (00:00) of the day. But since midnight is part of the next day, perhaps each day starts at 00:00 (12:00 AM) and ends at 23:59 (11:59 PM). So, each time in the same day must be in 00:00 to 23:59. 

But the problem says that each log entry is in chronological order. So, the entries are given in the order they were added. So, the times in the input are in non-decreasing order when considering their actual chronological order (including the date). But since the dates are missing, we have to determine how to split them into days such that the order is preserved, each day's entries are a consecutive group, and within each day, the times are in order, but also ensuring that no more than 10 entries are in the same minute (same date and same time, meaning same day and same hh:mm).

Wait, the problem statement says that each "[date:time]" has at most 10 lines. So, same date and same time (i.e., same minute) can't have more than 10 entries. So, when grouping the entries into days, for each day, within each minute (like 05:00 a.m. converted to a certain time), there can be at most 10 entries in that minute. 

So the challenge is to group the entries into consecutive days such that:

- Each group (day) has times that are in order (since the entries are in order overall, each day's entries are a consecutive sequence in the input).

- For each day, any consecutive entries with the same time (same hh:mm in their 24-hour converted form) must not exceed 10 in count.

But wait, the problem says that for each date:time in the original log, there were not more than 10 lines. So, after the dates are lost, the same time (hh:mm) in the same day (as determined by the grouping) can't have more than 10 entries. 

So, the way to model this is that each entry's time is converted to its minutes in the day (0-1439). Then, as we process each entry in order, we track the current day. For each entry, we can decide whether it can be part of the current day or must start a new day. The key is to group the entries into days such that for any group (day), in the same minute (same time in 24-hour format), there are no more than 10 entries. 

But since the entries are processed in order, the same minute in the same day must have entries in consecutive positions. Wait, no. Because the original log could have entries for the same time (same date:time) in consecutive lines. For example, multiple entries within the same minute on the same date. But after the date is lost, the problem is that when grouping into days, if two entries have the same time (like 05:00 a.m.) but were originally on different dates, they could be grouped into the same day, leading to more than 10 entries in that minute. So, we have to make sure that in each day, the count of entries per same time (same hh:mm) does not exceed 10. 

Wait, the problem says that the original logs had for each [date:time] (i.e., same date and same time) no more than 10 entries. So, when Alex lost the dates, the entries are ordered, but the same time (like 05:00 a.m.) could have been from different dates. But when grouping into days, the same time in the same day (as per the grouping) would count towards the 10 limit. 

So, for the grouped days, the entries must be such that in each day, any entries with the same converted time (e.g., 05:00 a.m. becomes 5*60=300 minutes) can't have more than 10 entries. 

So the problem reduces to: split the sequence of entries into consecutive days such that in each day, for each minute (as per the converted time), the number of entries in that minute is <=10. Also, each day's entries are a consecutive group in the input, and the order of entries is preserved. We need to find the minimal number of days possible.

Now, how to model this. Let's think of the entries as a list. For each position i in the list, we need to track how many entries in the same minute have been encountered in the current day. 

The approach would be to process the entries in order, keeping track of the current day's entries. For each entry, convert its time to the 24-hour minute. Then, check if adding this entry to the current day would violate the 10 entries per minute rule. If adding it would cause a minute's count to exceed 10, then a new day must start. 

But there's a catch. Suppose that in the current day, the current entry's minute has some entries already. For example, suppose the current day has 9 entries at minute 300. The next entry is also at 300. Then adding it would make 10, which is allowed. Then another entry at 300 would need a new day. 

But the entries must be consecutive. So, once a new day starts, all entries after that are part of the new day. So, the grouping is into consecutive days. 

The algorithm would be:

Initialize day_count = 1. 

current_day_minutes is a dictionary that tracks the count of entries per minute in the current day.

For each entry in order:

   convert time to minute (0-1439).

   check if adding this entry to current_day_minutes would exceed 10.

   if current_day_minutes.get(minute, 0) + 1 > 10:

       start a new day: day_count +=1.

       reset current_day_minutes to empty, add this entry's minute with count 1.

   else:

       increment the count for this minute in current_day_minutes.

This seems straightforward. But wait, what about when a new day starts because the current entry's time is earlier than the previous entry's time? For example, if the previous entry was at 23:59 (1439 minutes) and the next entry is 00:00 (0 minutes). If they are in the same day, then the time would appear to go backwards, which is impossible since the log is in chronological order. Therefore, the entries in the same day must be in non-decreasing order. Because each day's entries must be a consecutive group of the original entries, and the original entries are in chronological order (i.e., increasing order of actual time including date). So, within a day, the times can be non-decreasing. But if a new day starts, the entries in that day can have times that are earlier than the previous day's times, but the actual dates are different. 

Wait, the original entries are in chronological order. So, the entries are ordered by their actual (date:time). So, when dates are stripped, the times in the input could be non-monotonic. For example, entry 1: [11:59 PM] (day 1), entry 2: [12:00 AM] (day 2). The times in the input would be 23:59 and 00:00, which would be in order if the dates are consecutive. But if we grouped both into the same day, that would imply that the time went from 23:59 to 00:00 in the same day, which is impossible. Therefore, the entries in a day must form a non-decreasing sequence of times. Because otherwise, the actual time (with date) would have to be non-decreasing, but if in the same day, the time would have to be non-decreasing. 

Wait, the original logs are in chronological order, so each entry is after the previous in actual time. So, the entries in the input are ordered in the same way as their actual date:time. Therefore, for the entries grouped into a day, their times (without date) must be non-decreasing. Because if the times were to decrease, that would imply that the next entry is from the next day. For example, previous entry is 23:59, current entry is 00:00. Since the actual time is later (next day), but the grouped day would have to have 00:00 after 23:59, which is impossible. 

So, in addition to the 10 per minute constraint, each day's entries must have non-decreasing times. 

So, the algorithm must also account for the time sequence. So, when adding a new entry to the current day:

- The time of the new entry must be >= the previous entry's time in the same day. 

So, the steps are:

For each entry in order:

   convert time to minutes.

   check two conditions:

      1. the current entry's time is >= the previous entry's time in the current day.

      2. adding this entry to the current day's minute count would not exceed 10.

   If either condition is violated, start a new day.

So, we need to track:

- The current day's last time (to ensure that times are non-decreasing).

- The count of entries per minute in the current day.

So, the algorithm becomes:

Initialize day_count = 1.

current_day_minutes = {}  # counts per minute

prev_time_in_day = -infinity.

For each entry in the list:

    convert time to t (minutes).

    if t < prev_time_in_day or (current_day_minutes.get(t, 0) + 1) >10:

        start a new day.

        day_count +=1

        current_day_minutes = {t:1}

        prev_time_in_day = t

    else:

        current_day_minutes[t] = current_day_minutes.get(t,0) +1

        prev_time_in_day = t

So, this way, each day's entries are in non-decreasing time order, and per minute entries <=10.

But wait, the problem statement says that the entries in the input are in chronological order. So, the actual date:time of each entry is after the previous. Therefore, when grouping into days, the entries in the same day must be consecutive and their times must be non-decreasing. If a new day is started, the entries in that day must also be consecutive and non-decreasing. 

So, the algorithm above should work. Let's test this against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

5

[05:00 a.m.]: ... (5:00 AM is 5*60=300)

Then next is same time. Then 01:10 PM is 13:10 (13h10m = 13*60+10 = 790?), wait no. Wait 12-hour format to 24-hour:

For a.m. times:

- 12:00 a.m. is 00:00 (0 minutes)

- 1:00 a.m. is 1 *60=60.

...

For 05:00 a.m. → 5:00 in 24h → 5*60=300.

Then the next is also 05:00 a.m. → same minute. Then 01:13 p.m. → 1:13 PM → 13:13 → 13*60+13= 793. Wait wait, wait. No. 1:13 PM is 13:13 in 24h → 13*60+13= 793. 

Wait the first entry is 05:00 a.m. → 5*60=300. Then the next is same, then 01:10 p.m. (13:10 → 13*60+10=790?), but the third entry in the input is [01:13 p.m.], then the fourth is [01:10 p.m.]. Wait, but in the input, the entries are in order, but the fourth entry's time is earlier than the third. So according to the original chronological order, this would be impossible. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps the sample input is not ordered by the time but by the actual date:time (which includes date). 

Wait the problem statement says that the log entries are in chronological order. So, the entries in the input are ordered as per their actual occurrence (including dates). But when the dates are stripped, their times can be in any order. But when we group them into days, each day's entries must form a consecutive group in the input, and their times (without dates) must be non-decreasing. 

But in the first sample input, the third entry is 1:13 PM, then the fourth is 1:10 PM. So, in chronological order (with date), the fourth entry must have occurred after the third. So, this implies that the fourth entry's time is part of a later day. 

So, according to our algorithm, when processing the fourth entry (after the third), we need to check if the time is >= the previous entry in the current day.

Let's process the first sample input step by step.

Sample Input 1:

5 entries.

Entries in order:

1. 05:00 a.m. → 5*60=300.

2. 05:00 a.m. → 300.

3. 01:13 p.m. → 13:13 → 13*60+13 = 793.

4. 01:10 p.m. → 13:10 → 790.

5. 11:40 p.m. → 23:40 → 23*60+40=1420.

So, processing entries in order.

Day starts as 1.

Entry 1: 300. prev_time is -inf. So allowed. current_day_minutes for 300 is 1.

Entry 2: 300. Check prev_time (300). 300 >=300: yes. Check count: 1+1=2 <=10. So allowed. current_day_minutes[300] becomes 2.

Entry 3: 793. prev_time is 300. 793 >=300: yes. Check count for 793: 0+1=1 <=10. allowed. current_day_minutes[793] =1. prev_time=793.

Entry 4: 790. Now, prev_time in current day is 793. 790 <793 → violates the non-decreasing condition. So, must start new day. Day count becomes 2. current_day_minutes reset: {790:1}, prev_time=790.

Entry5: 1420. Check against prev_time 790: 1420 >=790 → yes. Count for 1420 is 0+1=1. So add. prev_time=1420.

Total days: 2. Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

3 entries, times in order 9am, 8am, 7am. But since the entries are in chronological order (original date:time), each must be in a new day. Let's see:

Entry1: 9am → 9*60=540.

Entry2: 8am → 480. Since 480 <540, must start new day. So day_count=2.

Entry3: 7am →420. 420 <480 (prev_time in current day, which is day2). So new day. day_count=3.

Which matches the sample output.

So the algorithm seems to work.

So, the steps are:

For each entry:

1. Parse the time into minutes (24-hour format).

2. Check if adding this entry to the current day would cause:

   a. The time to be earlier than the previous entry in the day.

   OR

   b. The count of entries in this minute (for the current day) to exceed 10.

   If either is true, start a new day.

Thus, the code needs to:

- Parse the time from the string.

- Convert to minutes.

- Track current day's previous time and counts per minute.

Now, the code implementation:

First, parsing the time. The input format is like "05:00 a.m.".

Each time is given as hh:mm x.m., where x is a or p.

So, for example:

"05:00 a.m." → hh=05, mm=00, am.

"01:13 p.m." → hh=01, mm=13, pm.

The steps to convert to 24-hour format:

- Split into hh, mm, period (am/pm).

- Convert hh to integer. Note that 12 am is 00 hours, and 12 pm is 12 hours.

So:

if period is am:

   if hh == 12 → 0 hours.

   else → hh remains.

if period is pm:

   if hh == 12 → 12 hours.

   else → hh +12.

Then, minutes = hh *60 + mm.

So for example:

"12:00 a.m." → 0*60 +0 =0.

"12:00 p.m." → 12*60+0=720.

"01:13 p.m." → (1+12)*60 +13= 13*60+13=793.

"01:10 p.m." → 13*60+10=790.

So the code needs to parse each time string into hh, mm, period, then convert to 24-hour minutes.

Now, the code structure:

Read n.

Then read n lines. For each line, parse the time.

Then process each time in order.

Implement the algorithm as discussed.

Now, code steps:

Parsing the time string:

Each line starts with [hh:mm x.m.], so for example, the first entry is "[05:00 a.m.]: ..."

We can split the string to extract the time part. The time is between the first [ and the next ].

So for each line, split the first part:

For example, line = "[05:00 a.m.]: Server is started"

The time part is "05:00 a.m."

So, split the line as follows:

time_str = line.split(']')[0][1:].strip()

Then split time_str into parts:

hh_part, mm_part, period_part = ... ?

The time_str is in the format "hh:mm x.m."

So, for "05:00 a.m.", split on : and spaces.

Let me see:

"05:00 a.m." → split by ':' gives ['05', '00 a.m.'].

Then split the second part into minutes and am/pm.

Alternatively, split the time_str into parts using regex.

But perhaps the easiest way is to split into parts.

For example, split on the colon first:

parts = time_str.split(':')

hh = parts[0].strip()

mm_part = parts[1].strip()

Then, split mm_part into mm and period.

mm_part is like "00 a.m."

Split on whitespace:

mm_part_split = mm_part.split()

mm = mm_part_split[0]

period = mm_part_split[1].lower().replace('.', '')  # becomes 'am' or 'pm'.

Then, process:

hh = int(hh)

mm = int(mm)

if period == 'am':

    if hh == 12:

        hh_24 = 0

    else:

        hh_24 = hh

else:

    if hh ==12:

        hh_24 =12

    else:

        hh_24 = hh +12

total_minutes = hh_24 *60 + mm

So, that's the conversion.

Now, code for parsing:

Once we have the time_str, split into hh, mm, period.

Now, code:

In Python, for each line:

line = input().strip()

time_part = line[1:line.index(']') -1]  # wait, no. The line starts with [time], so split the first occurrence of ].

For example:

split the line into parts by splitting on ']: '.

parts = line.split(']: ')

time_str = parts[0][1:] → because the first part is [time, so after [0], we take [1:] to remove the [.

Wait:

line = "[05:00 a.m.]: Server is started"

splitting on ']: ' gives ["[05:00 a.m.", " Server..."].

Then time_str = "05:00 a.m."

Yes.

So code:

for each of the n lines:

line = input().strip()

time_str = line.split(']: ')[0][1:]

then process time_str as discussed.

So, let's code the parsing:

Then, split time_str into hh, mm, period.

Once parsed, compute total_minutes.

Now, the algorithm:

Initialize day_count =1.

current_day_minutes is a dictionary.

prev_time = -infinity.

Then, for each time in the list:

if current_day_minutes.get(t,0) +1 >10 or t < prev_time:

   day_count +=1

   current_day_minutes = {t:1}

   prev_time = t

else:

   current_day_minutes[t] +=1

   prev_time = t

So, code:

times = []
for _ in range(n):
    line = input().strip()
    time_str = line.split(']: ')[0][1:]
    # parse time_str
    hh_part, mm_part_period = time_str.split(':')
    hh = int(hh_part.strip())
    mm_part_period = mm_part_period.strip()
    mm_str, period_part = mm_part_period.split()
    mm = int(mm_str)
    period = period_part.lower().replace('.', '')
    # convert to 24h
    if period == 'am':
        if hh == 12:
            hh_24 = 0
        else:
            hh_24 = hh
    else:  # pm
        if hh ==12:
            hh_24 = 12
        else:
            hh_24 = hh +12
    total = hh_24 *60 + mm
    times.append(total)

Now process the times:

day_count =1

current_counts = {}

prev_time = -1  # since times can be 0 to 1439. So initial prev_time is set to -1, which is less than any possible time.

for t in times:

    if prev_time == -1:
        # first entry of the first day
        current_counts = {t:1}
        prev_time = t
    else:
        # check conditions
        if t < prev_time or (current_counts.get(t,0) +1) >10:
            day_count +=1
            current_counts = {t:1}
            prev_time = t
        else:
            current_counts[t] = current_counts.get(t,0) +1
            prev_time = t

print(day_count)

Wait, but what about when t is the same as prev_time? Like, adding another entry to the same minute. For example, current_counts has 9 entries for t=300. Adding another makes 10. That's allowed. Then adding another would require a new day. 

This code checks if current_counts.get(t,0) +1 >10. So if current_counts has 10, adding one more would be 11, which is over. So the code correctly starts a new day.

Testing sample input 2:

Times are 9am (540), 8am (480), 7am (420).

Processing:

First entry: 540. prev_time is -1. So set current_counts to {540:1}, prev_time=540.

Second entry: 480. Since 480 <540 → new day. day_count=2. current_counts is {480:1}, prev_time=480.

Third entry:420 <480 → new day. day_count=3. Output 3.

Sample input1:

times are 300,300,793,790,1420.

Processing:

First entry:300. prev_time=-1 → ok. counts {300:1}.

Second entry:300. 300 >=300. counts becomes 2. allowed. prev_time 300.

Third entry:793. 793 >=300. counts for 793 is 1. allowed.

prev_time is 793.

Fourth entry:790. 790 <793 → new day. day_count=2. counts {790:1}.

Fifth entry:1420 >=790. counts for 1420 is 1. allowed. prev_time 1420.

Total days:2.

Which matches the sample.

So the code should work.

Now, edge cases.

Test case where all times are the same and exactly 10 entries. Then 11th entry would start a new day.

n=11 entries, all 05:00 a.m.

Then the first 10 entries are in day1. The 11th is day2. So output 2.

Another edge case: entries in same minute but in increasing order. Like 10 entries at 00:00, then 10 entries at 00:00 again. So the first 10 in day1. The next 10 in day2. But the times are same as previous. But since in day2, the first entry is 00:00, which is allowed. Because the previous day's last time is 00:00 (day1), the next day's first entry is 00:00 (day2) → which is allowed, but in the same day, entries must be non-decreasing. So 10 entries in day1 (all 00:00), next entry would have to be new day. So for 20 entries, 2 days.

Another edge case: entries with times that loop around midnight. For example, 23:59 PM (1439), then 00:00 AM (0). Since 0 <1439, must start new day.

So two days.

So code handles that.

Now, code should be correct.
