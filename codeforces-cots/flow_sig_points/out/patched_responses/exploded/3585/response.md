Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of distinct good substrings in a given string. Let me understand the problem first.

So, the input is a string s, a binary string indicating which letters are good (1) or bad (0), and a number k. A good substring is one that has at most k bad characters. And I need to count all distinct substrings that meet this condition. The substrings are considered different if their content is different, even if they are in different positions.

Hmm. The main challenge here is efficiently enumerating all possible substrings that have at most k bad characters, but making sure that each unique substring is only counted once. Since the string can be up to 1500 characters long, the naive approach of checking all possible substrings (which would be O(n^2) in number) and storing them in a set might be too slow, especially because for each substring we have to check the count of bad characters. Also, storing all possible substrings in a set could use too much memory when the string is long, as there are O(n^2) possible substrings.

Wait, for a string of length 1500, the number of possible substrings is (1500 * 1501)/2 ≈ 1.1 million. But each substring could be up to 1500 characters. Storing each in a hash set would take a lot of memory. For example, if each substring is on average 750 characters, 1 million substrings would take 750 million characters, which is about 750MB. That's getting close to the memory limit. So that's a problem.

So, the naive approach is probably not going to work. We need a smarter way to count the unique substrings without storing all of them.

So the key is to find all possible substrings that meet the bad character condition and count the distinct ones. How can we do this efficiently?

Let me think about the problem constraints. Let's see:

The time limit is 2 seconds. For Python, which is slower than C++, we need an O(n^2) approach where each step is efficient.

The first thing I need is a way to compute the number of bad characters in any substring quickly. For that, maybe we can precompute a prefix sum array of bad characters. For each position i in the string, we can compute the number of bad characters from the start up to i. Then, the number of bad characters in the substring s[l..r] is the prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]. This way, checking the bad count for any substring is O(1).

Yes, that's manageable. So first step: precompute the prefix array.

Next, the main challenge is to generate all possible substrings that have at most k bad characters and count how many unique ones there are.

The problem is that even with the prefix array, checking each substring's bad count would be O(n^2), but we also need to track uniqueness. The problem is how to avoid duplicates.

For example, if the same substring appears in multiple positions, it should only be counted once. So the straightforward approach of iterating all possible substrings, checking the bad count, and adding them to a set would give the correct answer, but for n=1500, the number of substrings is about 1.1 million, which multiplied by O(1) for the set (since each substring is O(n) in length) would be O(n^3) time, which is 1e9 operations. That's way too slow for Python.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: Use a trie (prefix tree) to track unique substrings. For each possible starting position, we can traverse the trie and add characters, keeping track of the current number of bad characters. When the count exceeds k, we stop. This way, each substring is added only once, and the trie structure automatically handles duplicates.

But building a trie for this could be manageable. Let's think about the steps:

For each starting index i:

   Initialize current bad count to 0.

   Initialize a pointer to the root of the trie.

   For each j from i to n-1:

      Check if s[j] is a bad character. Increment current bad count if so.

      If current bad count exceeds k, break.

      Now, check if the current character s[j] is present as a child of the current trie node.

      If not, add it to the trie and increment the count of unique substrings.

      Move the current node to this child.

So this way, for each starting index i, we process the longest possible substring starting at i with at most k bad characters, and the trie ensures that we don't count duplicates.

This approach would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=1500 (1500^2 is 2.25 million operations). The trie's nodes would require each node to have up to 26 children (since there are 26 letters). For each character in each substring, we create a node if it's not present. The total number of nodes would be the number of unique substrings that are good. Since the maximum possible unique substrings is O(n^2), but with the k constraint, it's probably manageable.

Yes, this seems feasible.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute which characters are bad.

2. For each starting index i, traverse the string, keeping track of the number of bad characters so far.

3. For each j from i to n-1:

   a. If s[j] is bad, increment current bad count.

   b. If current bad count > k, break.

   c. Add the substring s[i..j] to the trie (or check if it exists), and if it's new, increment the result.

The trie approach would efficiently track the unique substrings.

Now, how to implement the trie in Python.

The trie can be represented as a dictionary of dictionaries. Each node is a dictionary mapping characters to child nodes. The root is an empty dictionary. For each character in the substring, we check if it's in the current node's children. If not, we add it and increase the count. Then, we proceed to the child node.

For example:

root = {}

current = root

for c in substring:

   if c not in current:

      current[c] = {}

      count +=1

   current = current[c]

But in this problem, the substring is built incrementally starting from index i. So for each i, we start at the root, and for each j from i to n-1:

   current = root

   for j in i to ...:

      c = s[j]

      if c not in current's children, create a new node and add to count.

      current = current's child for c.

But this approach would work. For each i, we start from the root and process each character in the substring starting at i until the bad count exceeds k. For each character in s[j], we check if it's present in the current trie node, and if not, create a new node and increment the count.

Wait, but the trie approach for this problem would not work as described. Because for each starting index i, we process the characters in the substring s[i], s[i+1], ..., s[j], adding each to the trie. But the trie's structure would allow us to track all possible unique substrings. However, when starting at i, adding the substring s[i..j] would correspond to a path in the trie starting from the root. But this way, the same substring starting at different positions would be considered as the same path in the trie, so duplicates would not be added. So the trie would automatically track all unique substrings.

Yes! So this approach would correctly count all unique substrings. Because, for example, if the same substring "ab" occurs at position (0,1) and (2,3), the trie would process the first 'a' and 'b' as children of root, and the second occurrence would follow the same path, so no new nodes are created. Thus, the count is incremented only once for each unique substring.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize a root (a dictionary).

Initialize a count variable to 0.

Precompute for each character in the alphabet whether it's bad.

Compute the bad array for each character.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-1:

   current_bad = 0

   current_node = root

   for j from i to n-1:

      char = s[j]

      if char is bad (based on the precomputed array):

          current_bad +=1

      if current_bad > k:

          break

      if char not in current_node:

          current_node[char] = {}

          count +=1

      current_node = current_node[char]

Thus, the count variable will accumulate all the unique substrings that are good.

This seems correct.

Now, let's test this logic against the sample input.

First sample input:

s = "ababab"

The second line is "01000000000000000000000000" which indicates that 'a' is good (since first character is 0?), wait wait: the problem says that the second line is a string of 0 and 1. If the i-th character is 1, then the i-th English letter is good. Otherwise, it's bad.

Wait, no: the problem says, "the i-th character of this string equals '1', then the i-th English letter is good, otherwise it's bad."

So in the first sample, the second line is '01000000000000000000000000'. So the first character (index 0) is 0, which corresponds to 'a' being bad. The second character (index 1) is 1, which corresponds to 'b' being good. All others are 0, so all other letters are bad.

So in the first sample, the bad characters are 'a', 'c'-'z', and the only good is 'b'.

Wait no: the second line's first character is for 'a', second for 'b', etc. So in the first sample, the second line's first character is 0: 'a' is bad. Second character is 1: 'b' is good. So in the string "ababab", the bad characters are 'a's. The good substrings can have at most 1 bad character.

So, for each substring, the number of 'a's (since 'a' is bad) must be ≤1.

The sample's answer is 5. Let's see:

The good substrings are "a", "ab", "b", "ba", "bab".

Wait, but each 'a' in the original string is a bad character. So when considering substrings:

For example, the substring "a" (starting at first position) has 1 bad character. So allowed. "ab" has 1 bad (a) plus 0 (b is good). So total bad is 1. So allowed.

The substring "b" has 0 bad, allowed.

The substring "ba" (like positions 1-2: "ba" in the string "ababab") has one bad (a). So allowed.

And "bab" (positions 1-3: "bab") has two a's? Wait the original string is "ababab". Let me index as 0-based:

Index 0: a (bad)
1: b (good)
2: a (bad)
3: b (good)
4: a (bad)
5: b (good)

So a substring like positions 1-3 is "bab" (chars 1, 2, 3: 'b','a','b').

In this substring, the bad characters are 'a' (one occurrence). So it's allowed (k=1).

So the substring "bab" is counted once.

But according to the sample explanation, there are 5 distinct substrings. So the trie approach would process all possible i and j, adding unique substrings.

So when i=0 (a):

current_bad starts at 0. Adding 'a' (bad, current_bad becomes 1). Since 1 <=k, add to trie. Count becomes 1.

Then j=1: 'ab'. 'a' (bad) is already counted. Then 'b' is good. So total bad is 1. So substring "ab" is added. Since the trie's root has 'a' node, then in that node, check for 'b'. If not present, add and count increments. So count becomes 2.

j=2: 'aba'. The third character is 'a' again. Now current_bad becomes 2, which is >k (1). So break. So substrings starting at i=0 are "a" and "ab".

For i=1 (b):

current_bad is 0. 'b' is good. Add to trie (count becomes 3). Then j=2: 'ba' (b is good, a is bad: total 1). So add 'ba' (count 4). Then j=3: 'bab' (b good, a bad, b good. total bad 1). Add 'bab' (count 5). Then j=4: 'baba' adds another 'a', which makes current_bad=2. So break.

So for i=1, adds 'b', 'ba', 'bab'.

Then i=2 (a):

current_bad starts at 0. 'a' is bad, so current_bad becomes 1. Add 'a' (already in trie? No, because previous 'a's were added in different paths. Wait no. The trie starts at root. For i=0, j=0: added 'a' (root's child 'a' exists). For i=2, j=2: 'a' is processed. So when we start at i=2, current_node is root. We check if 'a' is present in root's children. Yes. So we don't increment count. So 'a' is already in the trie, so not counted again. So current_bad is 1, so allowed, but no count increment.

Then j=3: 'ab' (a and b). current_bad is 1. So check if 'a' is in root (yes), then check if 'b' is in the 'a' node's children. From i=0, j=1: 'ab' was added, so 'a' node has 'b' child. So when processing i=2, j=3 (characters 'a' then 'b'), the path is root->a (from i=2) then 'b' (j=3). But the 'a' node (from i=2's first character) is the same as the root's 'a' node. So when we check if 'b' is present in the 'a' node's children, it is, so no count is added. So the substring 'ab' starting at i=2 is not counted again.

Then j=4: 'aba' would have two 'a's, which is over k=1.

So in this case, i=2 contributes nothing new.

Similarly for other i's.

So the trie approach would correctly count each unique substring once, even if they appear in different positions.

So the algorithm works for the first sample.

Now, for the second sample input. The letters are all bad (the second line is all 0's). So any character in the substring counts as a bad. So the maximum allowed is k=2. So substrings with length up to 2 are allowed (since each character is bad, so the count is the length of the substring). But wait, the problem says at most k bad. So for the second sample, k=2. So substrings can have 0, 1, or 2 bad characters. Since all characters are bad, this means substrings of length 0 (not possible), 1, or 2. Wait, no. Wait, the substring length is from 1 to n. So any substring of length 1 or 2. Because for length 3, 3 bad characters, which is over k=2.

The sample output is 8. The sample explanation lists substrings like "a", "aa", "ac", etc. So the algorithm would process all possible substrings of length up to 2, and longer ones if possible (but in this case, all characters are bad, so longer substrings would have more than 2 bad characters). So for each i, process until the current_bad exceeds k.

So the trie approach should work.

So the algorithm seems correct.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, read the inputs:

s = input().strip()

good_chars = input().strip()  # 26 characters, 0 or 1. good_chars[i] is '1' if the ith letter is good.

k = int(input())

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the third line is k. So:

The third line is an integer k.

So code steps:

Read s, then the binary string (length 26), then k.

Then, create a list to indicate whether a character is bad or not. For each character c in s, determine if it's bad.

Wait, the binary string indicates for each letter a-z. So for a character c, its index in the binary string is ord(c) - ord('a').

So for each c in s, if the (ord(c) - ord('a'))th character in the binary string is '0', then it's bad. Because, the problem says: if the i-th character of the string is '1', it's good; else, bad.

So:

is_bad = [False] * 26

for i in range(26):

    if good_chars[i] == '0':

        is_bad[i] = True

But wait, no. If the i-th character is '1', then it's good (so not bad). So, a character is bad if the corresponding bit is '0'.

So, for a character c:

if good_chars[ord(c)-ord('a')] == '1' → good (not bad)

else → bad.

So for each character in the string, we can precompute a list indicating if it's bad.

For example, in Python:

bad = [good_chars[i] == '0' for i in range(26)]

Then, for a character c in s, if bad[ord(c)-ord('a')] is True, then it's a bad character.

So, for each character in s, we can create a list indicating whether it's bad.

So:

s_bad = [bad[ord(c) - ord('a')] for c in s]

Now, the prefix sum array for the number of bad characters up to index i.

But in the algorithm, we don't need the prefix sum. Because for each starting index i, we track the current_bad as we move j from i to the end.

So the code would look like this:

Initialize the root as a dictionary.

count = 0

root = {}

for i in range(len(s)):

    current_node = root

    current_bad = 0

    for j in range(i, len(s)):

        c = s[j]

        if s_bad[j]:  # if the current character is bad

            current_bad +=1

        if current_bad > k:

            break

        # Now, check if c is in current_node

        if c not in current_node:

            current_node[c] = {}

            count +=1

        # move to the next node

        current_node = current_node[c]

Thus, the code would process all possible substrings and count the unique ones.

This should work.

Now, let's test the first sample.

Sample 1:

s = 'ababab' → indexes 0-5.

bad array:

for the second line '01000000000000000000000000' (only the second character is 1 → 'b' is good, all others are bad.

So for each character in s:

index 0: 'a' → ord('a')-ord('a')=0 → good_chars[0] is '0' → bad.

index 1: 'b' → 1 → good_chars[1] is '1' → not bad.

index 2: 'a' → bad.

index 3: 'b' → good.

index 4: 'a' → bad.

index5: 'b' → good.

s_bad is [True, False, True, False, True, False]

Now, k=1.

For each i from 0 to 5:

i=0:

current_node = root (empty dict).

current_bad=0.

j=0: 'a' is bad → current_bad=1 ≤1.

Check if 'a' in root: no. Add it. count=1.

current_node now points to the new 'a' node.

j=1: 'b' is good → current_bad remains 1.

Check 'b' in current_node (which is the 'a' node). Not present. Add. count=2.

current_node now is the 'b' node under 'a' node.

j=2: 'a' is bad → current_bad=2 >1. Break.

So substrings 'a' and 'ab' added.

i=1:

current_node is root.

current_bad=0.

j=1: 'b' is good. current_bad=0. Add 'b' to root. count=3.

current_node is 'b' node.

j=2: 'a' is bad → current_bad=1. Check 'a' in 'b' node. Not present. Add. count=4. current_node now 'a' under 'b'.

j=3: 'b' is good → current_bad=1. Check 'b' in 'a' node. Not present. Add. count=5. current_node is 'b' under 'a' → 'b' node.

j=4: 'a' is bad → current_bad=2>1. Break.

So substrings 'b', 'ba', 'bab' are added.

i=2:

current_node is root.

current_bad=0.

j=2: 'a' is bad → current_bad=1. Check 'a' in root → yes (from i=0). So no addition. current_node is 'a' node.

j=3: 'b' is good → current_bad=1. Check 'b' in 'a' node → yes (from i=0, j=1). No addition. current_node is 'b' under 'a'.

j=4: 'a' is bad → current_bad=2>1. Break. So nothing added.

i=3:

current_node is root.

j=3: 'b' is good. Add to root. But wait, 'b' was added before (i=1, j=1). So check if 'b' is present in root → yes. So no addition. current_node is 'b' node.

j=4: 'a' is bad → current_bad=1. Check if 'a' in 'b' node → yes (from i=1, j=2). So no addition. current_node is 'a' node.

j=5: 'b' is good → current_bad=1. Check 'b' in 'a' node → yes (from i=1, j=3). No addition.

So no new substrings added here.

Similarly for other i's, but the count would be 5, matching the first sample.

Thus, the code works.

Now, the code is straightforward. But in Python, using dictionaries (hash maps) can be efficient enough. However, for each node, using a regular dict may be slow for large data. But given that n is up to 1500, and each step is O(1), this should be manageable.

But let's check the time complexity. For each i (1500 iterations), and for each j from i to n (up to 1500 iterations), and for each step, the operations are O(1) (checking and inserting into the dict). So 1500*1500=2.25e6 steps, which is acceptable.

Memory-wise, each node is a dict. Each unique substring corresponds to a path in the trie. The number of nodes is equal to the number of unique substrings. For the worst case where all possible substrings are unique (like all characters distinct), the number of nodes is O(n^2). For n=1500, this is about 2.25e6 nodes. Each node is a dictionary, which in Python has some overhead, but 2.25 million nodes would take some memory. However, the problem allows 512MB, which should be sufficient.

Thus, this approach should work.

Now, the code.

First, read the inputs:

s = input().strip()

good = input().strip()

k = int(input())

Then, create a list indicating if each character is bad.

bad = [False] * 26

for i in range(26):

    if good[i] == '0':

        bad[i] = True

Then, for each character in s, precompute whether it's bad:

s_bad = [bad[ord(c) - ord('a')] for c in s]

Then, build the trie and count.

root = {}

count = 0

for i in range(len(s)):

    current_node = root

    current_bad = 0

    for j in range(i, len(s)):

        c = s[j]

        if s_bad[j]:

            current_bad +=1

        if current_bad > k:

            break

        if c not in current_node:

            current_node[c] = {}

            count +=1

        current_node = current_node[c]

print(count)

Yes, that's the code.
