Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to compute the Euler's totient function for the product of a range of numbers in an array, modulo 1e9+7. The constraints are pretty tight: n and q can be up to 200,000 each, and the numbers in the array can be up to 1e6. So a naive approach where we compute the product for each query and then factorize it to calculate phi is definitely not going to work. That's way too slow, especially for large ranges where the product could be astronomically large. So we need a smarter approach here.

First, let's recall how the Euler's totient function works. For a number n with prime factorization p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn, the totient is n multiplied by the product for each prime pi of (1 - 1/pi). So φ(n) = n * product_{p|n} (1-1/p). So, for the product of a range, we need to compute the product of all the a_i's in the range, then multiply it by the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes p that divide any of the a_i's in that range.

But computing the product directly is impossible because even if the a_i's are up to 1e6, their product over a range of 2e5 elements would be way too large. So we need to represent the product in terms of its prime factors and track the exponents. However, even that might not be feasible for very large ranges because the number of primes up to 1e6 is quite a lot, and tracking exponents for all primes for each possible range would be memory-intensive.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. The totient function's formula can be split into two parts: the product of all a_i's (the product part), multiplied by the product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p in the product. So, if we can compute the product modulo 1e9+7 (but wait, no—because the product might be huge, but the totient is that product multiplied by terms that reduce it. However, the problem requires the totient modulo 1e9+7, which complicates things. Because even if the product is modulo 1e9+7, when we apply the (1-1/p) terms, we need to compute it correctly modulo 1e9+7. Hmm, this seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can separate the problem into two parts:

1. Compute the product of the a_i's in the range, modulo MOD (1e9+7), but multiply it by the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes p that divide any a_i in the range. Wait, but the product of the a_i's is multiplied by the product of (1 - 1/p) for each distinct prime p in the product. So, if we can track the product of the a_i's modulo MOD and track for each prime p whether it appears in the range, we can compute the result.

But the product of the a_i's modulo MOD is straightforward if we can compute the product for the range modulo MOD. But even that is a problem for large ranges. Wait, but if we have a prefix product array modulo MOD, then for a range [l, r], the product is (prefix[r] * inverse(prefix[l-1])) mod MOD. But this only works if all the a_i's are invertible modulo MOD, which they are as long as they are not 0. However, in our case, a_i can be 1, which is invertible, or numbers up to 1e6. But MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime. So all a_i are between 1 and 1e6, so their product modulo MOD is non-zero only if none of them are 0. But since a_i is a positive integer, they can't be 0. So the prefix product approach is possible here.

But wait, the product could be zero modulo MOD? No, because MOD is 1e9+7, and each a_i is at most 1e6. So the product of any a_i's in a range cannot be divisible by MOD. So their product mod MOD is non-zero, so the inverses exist. Therefore, we can precompute the prefix product modulo MOD, and then for a query [l, r], compute the product as (prefix[r] * inverse(prefix[l-1])) mod MOD. So that's the product part.

Then, the second part is to compute the product of (1 - 1/p) for all distinct primes p that divide any of the a_i in the range. So for each query, we need to find all primes that are present in the prime factors of any a_i in the range, and multiply their (1-1/p) terms together.

The challenge here is how to efficiently compute, for any given range, the set of primes that appear in that range. Then, multiply all (1 - 1/p) for those primes.

So the problem reduces to two separate parts:

1. Compute the product of the a_i's in the range mod MOD, divided by the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes p in the product. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is phi(n) = n * product (1-1/p) for each distinct prime p dividing n. So phi is the product of the a_i's multiplied by the product of (1-1/p) for each distinct prime in the product. Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify:

If n = product of a_i from l to r, then phi(n) is n multiplied by product_{p | n} (1 - 1/p). So phi(n) mod MOD is ( (product_of_a_i mod MOD) * product( (1 - 1/p) mod MOD ) ) mod MOD. So yes, the two parts are the product mod MOD, and the product of (1 - 1/p) terms mod MOD.

But the problem is that for each query, we need to compute the product of all primes p that divide the product of the a_i's in the range, and then multiply those (1 - 1/p) terms.

So the key is to track, for each query, the set of primes present in the product. But how to do that efficiently for many queries?

An approach could be for each prime p, track the positions where it appears in the array. Then, for a query [l, r], check if p appears in any a_i in that range. If yes, include (1-1/p) in the product. But since there are up to 1e6 primes (since a_i is up to 1e6), and q is up to 2e5, this approach would be O(q * number of primes), which is way too slow.

So we need a way to precompute for each prime p, the ranges in which it appears. Then, for each query, quickly find all primes that have at least one occurrence in the range. But how?

Alternative idea: For each a_i, factorize it into its prime factors. Then, for each prime in the factorization, record that it appears in the i-th position. Then, for each prime p, we can have a list of positions where it appears. Then, for a query [l, r], a prime p is present in the product if and only if there is at least one occurrence of p in the array between l and r. So for each prime p, we need to check if there's any occurrence in [l, r]. If there is, multiply the result by (1-1/p) mod MOD.

But checking this for every possible prime is not feasible. So perhaps we can precompute for each prime p a binary array indicating presence, and then use a binary indexed tree or a segment tree to query if there's any occurrence in a range. However, with 2e5 queries and 1e6 primes, this approach is O(q * log n * number of primes), which is way too slow.

Hmm. So this seems like a dead end. We need a way to compute the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes p that appear at least once in the range [l, r]. So the problem reduces to for each query, find the product over primes p where p divides at least one a_i in [l, r], of (1-1/p) mod MOD.

This is equivalent to multiplying the product of all (1-1/p) for each p that appears in any of the a_i's in the range.

So the key is to precompute for each position the primes that appear in a_i, and for each query, collect all unique primes in the range and multiply their (1-1/p) terms.

But how to compute this efficiently for many queries?

An alternative approach is to use a sieve to factorize all a_i's, and for each prime p, track the positions where it occurs. Then, for each query [l, r], the primes involved are the primes that have at least one occurrence in the range. So for each prime p, if there exists an index i in [l, r] where a_i is divisible by p, then p is included.

So the problem is to find all primes p such that there exists at least one a_i in [l, r] where p divides a_i.

This is similar to a problem where we need to find the number of distinct elements in a range. But here, the elements are primes that divide any a_i in the range. The standard approach for distinct elements in a range is to use a segment tree with a bitset, but for 1e6 possible primes, this is impossible.

Alternative idea: for each prime p, precompute a prefix array that counts the number of times p appears in the first i elements. Then, for a query [l, r], the count for p is the sum from l to r. If the count is >0, then p is present. So for each query, iterate over all primes p and check if their prefix sum in the range is >0. But with 1e6 primes and 2e5 queries, this is 2e11 operations, which is impossible.

This approach is not feasible.

Another thought: The primes that divide any a_i in [l, r] are the union of all primes in the prime factors of each a_i in [l, r]. So, for each a_i, during preprocessing, store the set of primes that divide it. Then, for a query [l, r], the primes to consider are the union of the primes in each a_i from l to r.

But how to compute this union efficiently for multiple ranges?

This seems similar to a problem where we need to find the set of all primes that appear in any of the elements in the range. To compute this for multiple queries, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion with some precomputed data structures.

Alternatively, for each prime p, we can precompute a list of the indices where it appears (i.e., the a_i's divisible by p). Then, for a query [l, r], the prime p is included if there exists at least one occurrence in the list that is between l and r.

So for each query, we need to find all primes p where the earliest occurrence of p in the list is <= r and the latest occurrence is >= l. Wait, no. For a given p, the list of positions where it appears is sorted. So to check if p has any occurrence in [l, r], we can binary search in the list for p's positions to see if there exists a position in [l, r].

So for each query, to find all primes p that have any occurrence in the range [l, r], we can:

For each prime p, check if there's any a_i in [l, r] that is divisible by p. Which can be done by binary searching p's occurrence list.

But again, iterating over all primes and checking this for each query is not feasible.

Hmm. So this approach is O(q * number_of_primes) which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

Alternative Idea: For each a_i, the primes that divide it are known. So for each position i, we can have a set of primes. Then, the primes in the range [l, r] are the union of all primes in the sets of positions l to r. The problem is to compute the product over all unique primes in this union.

This is similar to the problem of maintaining a set of elements over a range and querying the product of some function over the elements. But this is difficult to do with standard data structures.

Another approach: For each prime p, precompute a list of intervals where it appears. Then, for a query [l, r], collect all primes p that have at least one interval overlapping [l, r]. But again, how to do this quickly.

Alternatively, for each prime p, precompute the positions where it appears, sorted in a list. For a query [l, r], the presence of p can be determined by checking if there's any occurrence of p in [l, r] using binary search. But the problem is how to collect all such p's efficiently.

But the problem is that for each query, the number of primes that have occurrences in the range could be up to the sum of the number of primes in each a_i in the range. For example, if each a_i is a product of many primes, then the union would be a lot. So for a query that covers the entire array, the number of primes could be up to the total number of primes in all a_i's, which could be up to 2e5 * log(1e6) ~ 2e5 * 14 = 2.8e6 primes. So for each query, even if we could collect all the primes in O(k) time where k is the number of primes in the union, for 2e5 queries each with 1e6 primes, this is 2e11 operations, which is impossible.

Thus, we need a way to precompute the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes that appear in any a_i in the range. So how can we compute this product quickly?

Alternative Idea: Let's precompute for each position i, the product of (1 - 1/p) for all primes p in a_i. Then, the product for a range [l, r] is the product of these terms for each a_i in the range, but divided by duplicates. Wait, no. Because if multiple a_i's have the same prime p, it's counted only once. So this approach would overcount. For example, if a_i and a_j both have prime 2, then (1-1/2) would be multiplied once, but in this approach, it's multiplied once for a_i and once for a_j, which is wrong. So this doesn't work.

So this approach is incorrect.

Another Idea: The product of (1-1/p) for all primes in the range is equivalent to the product over all primes p that appear in any a_i in the range of (1-1/p). So this is the product of (1-1/p) for each unique prime p in the union of primes from a_l to a_r.

So the problem reduces to, for each query [l, r], compute the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p that appear in any a_i in the range. Then multiply this product with the product of the a_i's in the range mod MOD, and that's the answer.

So the key challenge is to compute this product efficiently.

So, perhaps we can model this as a multiplicative function. For each prime p, (1-1/p) is a factor that is included if p appears in the range. So the product is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p present in the range.

This seems similar to a problem where each element contributes a set of elements (primes), and for a range query, we need to compute the product of (1-1/p) for all distinct primes in the union of these sets.

So how can this be done?

An alternative approach is to precompute for each prime p, the positions where it appears, and for each query, check whether p is present in the range. But again, this is O(q * primes), which is not feasible.

Hmm. Let's think differently. Let's precompute for each index i, the primes in a_i. Then, for each query [l, r], collect all primes in the a_i's in that range and take the product. But how?

Wait, maybe we can use a segment tree. Each node in the segment tree stores the set of primes in the interval, but this is not feasible because storing the set of primes for each node would take too much memory and time. For example, a segment tree for 2e5 elements would have 4e5 nodes, and each node's primes could be up to O(1e6), which is impossible.

Alternative Idea: Instead of storing the actual primes in each segment tree node, store the product of (1-1/p) for all unique primes in the interval. But how to combine the products of two intervals.

The problem is that when you combine two intervals, the primes in the combined interval are the union of the primes in the left and right intervals. So the product for the combined interval is the product of the products of the left and right intervals, but divided by the product of (1-1/p) for primes that are present in both intervals. Wait, no. Because the product for the left interval is the product of (1-1/p) for primes in the left, and the right is the product for primes in the right. The combined product is the product of all (1-1/p) for primes in left or right. So if there are overlapping primes between left and right, those primes are only counted once. Thus, the combined product is the product of the left's product and the right's product, divided by the product of (1-1/p) for primes that are in both left and right. But this is not feasible because we can't track which primes are overlapping between left and right segments.

So this approach is not feasible either.

Alternative Idea: Let's precompute a binary array for each prime p, indicating whether it appears up to each position. For example, for prime p, we can create an array where the i-th entry is 1 if p appears in the first i elements, and 0 otherwise. But again, with 1e6 primes and 2e5 elements, this would require 2e11 storage, which is impossible.

Hmm. So, perhaps we need to find a way to represent the presence of primes in a way that allows fast queries. Let's think about inclusion-exclusion. What if we represent the product of (1-1/p) as a cumulative product, but only for primes that have appeared up to a certain position. But each time a new prime is encountered, it multiplies the product by (1-1/p). However, this would require that each prime is processed once, the first time it's encountered. Then, the cumulative product up to i is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes that have appeared in the array up to i. But this would not work for ranges that start after the first occurrence of p, because a query [l, r] would include primes that first appeared between l and r, but the cumulative product up to r would include all primes up to r, not just those in the range.

But perhaps if we can track, for each prime p, the first occurrence and the last occurrence, but I don't see how that helps.

Wait, here's an alternative idea: For each prime p, precompute all the ranges of the array where it appears. Then, for a query [l, r], the product of (1-1/p) is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p that have at least one occurrence in [l, r]. So, if we can find all primes p that have their earliest occurrence <= r and their latest occurrence >= l. But how to compute that for a query.

Alternatively, for each prime p, note that the product (1-1/p) is included in the query's product if p appears in any a_i in [l, r]. So for each prime p, we can precompute a list of the positions where it appears. Then, for each query [l, r], for each p, we can binary search in its positions to see if any of them falls within [l, r]. But again, the problem is that we can't do this for all primes p for each query, as it's O(number of primes) per query.

But perhaps the number of primes up to 1e6 is manageable. Let's calculate: primes up to 1e6. The number of primes below 1e6 is approximately 78498. So that's about 7.8e4 primes. For each query, processing 7.8e4 primes would take 2e5 * 7.8e4 = 1.56e10 operations, which is way too much for the time limit (3 seconds, which is about 3e8 operations).

So that's not feasible either.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let's think about the multiplicative nature of Euler's totient function. Wait, the totient function is multiplicative, but not completely multiplicative. So for two coprime numbers a and b, phi(ab) = phi(a)*phi(b). But for numbers that are not coprime, this doesn't hold.

But if the product of the range is the product of a sequence of numbers, and we need to compute phi of that product. So phi(prod) = prod * product_{p | prod} (1-1/p).

So the key is to compute the product of the a_i's and the product of (1-1/p) for each distinct prime in the product.

Wait, but the product of (1-1/p) can be computed as the product for all primes that divide the product. So perhaps if we can track all the primes that divide the product of the range.

But how?

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each prime p, the product of (1-1/p) mod MOD. Then, for each query, multiply all such primes' values. The challenge is to find which primes are present in the product of the range.

But again, how to find these primes.

Alternative Idea: The product of the a_i's is the product of all primes in their factorizations, each raised to the sum of exponents in the a_i's. But phi(n) is the product of each p^k term multiplied by (1-1/p). So phi(n) = product (p^k) * product (1-1/p) for each p.

But product (p^k) is just the product of the a_i's. So phi(n) is the product of a_i's multiplied by product (1-1/p) for each distinct p in the product.

So the main challenge is to compute for a range, the product of a_i's mod MOD, and the product of (1-1/p) for distinct primes in the product.

The product of a_i's mod MOD can be done with a prefix product array and modular inverses.

So the first part is manageable.

The second part requires multiplying (1-1/p) mod MOD for all distinct primes p that appear in any a_i in the range.

So how to compute this efficiently?

Another Idea: Let's think of this as a bitmask problem. Each a_i contributes some primes, and the query's product is the OR of the primes in the range. Then, the product is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes set in the OR. But this is not helpful for implementation.

Wait, but the primes are up to 1e6, which is too many to track in a bitmask.

Alternative Idea: For each a_i, when we factorize it into primes, we can represent the set of primes as a collection of events. Then, for each prime p, we can note the positions where it appears, and for each query [l, r], we can determine if p is present in that range by checking if there exists any occurrence of p in [l, r].

But again, doing this for all primes for each query is time-consuming.

Wait, but perhaps the number of primes that can appear in a query is limited. For example, if each a_i is up to 1e6, the maximum number of distinct primes in any a_i's factorization is small (like up to log2(1e6) ≈ 20). So for each query, the union of primes from all a_i's in the range is the sum of up to (r - l + 1) * 20 primes. But for a query with r-l+1 = 2e5, that's 2e5 * 20 = 4e6 primes, which is manageable per query if we can process them in O(1) per prime, but for 2e5 queries, that's 8e8 operations, which might be tight but possibly manageable.

But how to collect all the primes in the range [l, r]?

Here's a possible approach:

1. Preprocess each a_i into its set of distinct primes.

2. For each query [l, r], iterate through each index from l to r, collect all the primes in the a_i's, and keep track of the unique ones.

3. Multiply the product of (1-1/p) for these unique primes.

But this approach's time complexity is O(q * K), where K is the average number of primes per a_i multiplied by the average query length. For example, if each query is of length 1e5 and each a_i has 10 primes, then per query it's 1e6 operations, which for 2e5 queries would be 2e11 operations—way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each prime p, precompute a prefix sum array that counts the number of times p has appeared up to index i. Then, for a query [l, r], if the count of p in [l, r] is >= 1, multiply the product by (1-1/p). So for each prime p, we can check in O(1) time whether it's present in the range. But again, the problem is iterating over all primes for each query.

But the number of primes is 78,498. For each query, checking each of them would take 2e5 * 7.8e4 = 1.56e10 operations. That's way too much.

So this is also not feasible.

Another Idea: Let's precompute for each index i, a bitmask of the primes present up to i. But since the primes are up to 1e6, the bitmask is impossible to store.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Maybe there's a mathematical way to precompute the product of (1-1/p) for all possible primes up to 1e6, and then for each query, determine which primes are present and multiply their (1-1/p) terms. But again, this brings us back to the problem of efficiently finding the primes present in the range.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of other approaches.

Wait, maybe we can precompute for each position i, the product of (1-1/p) for all primes in a_i. Then, the product for a range [l, r] would be the product of these terms multiplied by the product of the a_i's. But this is incorrect because if a prime p appears in multiple a_i's in the range, the (1-1/p) term should be applied only once, not once per occurrence. For example, if a range has two numbers divisible by 2, the term (1-1/2) should be multiplied once, not twice. So this approach is incorrect.

So, that's not the way.

Alternative Idea: The product of (1-1/p) for all primes in the range can be expressed as the product of (1-1/p) for each prime p, raised to the indicator function that p is present in the range. So, the product is the product over all primes p of (1-1/p) ^ (if p is present in the range, then 1 else 0).

But how to compute this for all primes.

But since multiplication is commutative and associative, this can be written as the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p that have at least one occurrence in the range.

So, the crux is to find all primes p that are present in the range.

Another Idea: Perhaps the problem can be solved using Möbius inversion or inclusion-exclusion. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, for each a_i, precompute the set of primes in its factorization. Then, for each query [l, r], the primes are the union of the primes in each a_i's factorization in the range. So, the primes needed are the union of all these sets.

But again, how to compute this union efficiently.

Wait, perhaps we can use a hash set for each query. For example, for each query, iterate through each a_i in the range, factorize it, and add its primes to a set. Then, after processing all a_i's in the range, multiply the product of (1-1/p) for all primes in the set. But this approach is O(q * (average number of primes per a_i) * (average query length)). For example, if each query is of length 1e5 and each a_i has 10 primes, that's 1e6 operations per query. For 2e5 queries, that's 2e8 operations. Which might be feasible, but just barely. But considering that factorizing each a_i in the query could take O(number of primes in its factorization), and the a_i's could be up to 1e6, which requires factorization.

Wait, but if we precompute the primes for each a_i during preprocessing, then during the query, we can just collect the primes from each a_i's precomputed list. That way, factorization is done once per a_i during preprocessing, and during queries, we just iterate through the primes in each a_i's list.

So during preprocessing:

- For each a_i, factorize it into its distinct primes. Store for each a_i the set of primes (without duplicates). So, for example, if a_i is 4 = 2^2, then the primes are just {2}.

Then, for each query [l, r], we need to collect all the primes from the a_i's in the range, and compute the product of (1-1/p) for the unique primes.

But even this approach's time depends on the sum over all queries of the sum of the number of primes in each a_i in the range. For example, if each query is of length 1e5 and each a_i has 10 primes, that's 1e6 primes per query. For 2e5 queries, that's 2e11 operations—way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: So, given the time constraints, perhaps the only way to proceed is to find a way to precompute for each prime p, the positions where it appears, and for each query, check each prime p's positions to see if it's present in the range. But since this is O(q * primes), which is 2e5 * 7.8e4 = 1.56e10 operations, which is way too much.

But perhaps we can find a way to precompute a multiplicative product for each possible interval, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of primes in the array is small. For example, if the a_i's are all 1, then there are no primes. Or if the array has many duplicates.

But in the worst case, each a_i is a new prime, leading to 2e5 primes. So the worst case is still O(q * primes) which is 2e5 * 2e5 = 4e10 operations.

This is not feasible.

So what's the alternative?

Perhaps there's a mathematical way to represent the product of (1-1/p) for all primes in the range as a product of certain precomputed values.

Wait, here's a new Idea: For each prime p, precompute the prefix array where the i-th entry is the product of (1-1/p) if p has appeared up to i. Then, for a query [l, r], if p appears at least once in the range, multiply by (1-1/p). But how to precompute this.

But this approach would require for each prime p to precompute a prefix array of products. Then, for a query [l, r], the contribution of p is (product up to r) / (product up to l-1), but this only works if the product up to i is the product of (1-1/p) raised to the number of times p has been seen up to i. But in our case, the exponent is 1 if p has been seen at least once, else 0.

Alternatively, if we can represent the product as (1-1/p) if p has been seen in the range. But this is not multiplicative.

Alternatively, for each prime p, precompute a binary array indicating whether it has appeared in the range up to index i. Then, for a query [l, r], the product is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p where the binary array at r is 1 and the binary array at l-1 is 0. But again, how to compute this efficiently.

But how to compute the product of all primes p where p appears in the range [l, r].

Let me think of this as a multiplicative function. Let’s say we have a value T, which is initially 1. For each prime p in the range, multiply T by (1-1/p). So, T is the product over all primes present in the range.

The problem is to compute T for arbitrary ranges.

If we can precompute for each prime p, the positions where it first appears and last appears, perhaps we can model this as a multiplicative segment tree where each leaf node represents the primes introduced at that position, and each internal node represents the product of the primes introduced in its range. But since each a_i may introduce multiple primes, this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, for each position i, when we process the primes in a_i, we can note that these primes are being added to the global set. So for each prime p in a_i's factors, if this is the first occurrence of p in the array, then we multiply the global product by (1-1/p). Then, the product up to index i is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes seen up to i. However, this approach only works if the query is [1, r], but for arbitrary [l, r], it's not applicable.

But perhaps if we can represent the product up to index i as the product of (1-1/p) for all primes that have appeared at least once up to i. Then, for a query [l, r], the product would be the product of primes that appeared up to r but not up to l-1. So the product is (product up to r) * inverse( product up to l-1 ). But this is not correct, because the product up to r includes all primes up to r, including those that appeared before l. But the query [l, r] should include primes that appeared in [l, r], which may include primes that appeared before l but not in [l, r]. So this approach is incorrect.

For example, suppose a prime p appears at position 1 and position 5. For a query [2,5], p is present in position 5, so it should be included. The product up to 5 is (1-1/p). The product up to 1 is (1-1/p). So the ratio is 1. But the correct product for the query [2,5] is (1-1/p) since p appears in position 5. But the ratio would be (1-1/p) / (1-1/p) = 1, which is incorrect.

Thus, this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So what else can we do?

Perhaps the only feasible way is to precompute for each prime p the earliest and latest occurrence, and then use a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to track the presence of primes in the ranges.

But I'm not seeing how.

Another Idea: Let's consider that the product of (1-1/p) for a range [l, r] is the product of all (1-1/p) where p appears in any a_i in that range. So for each query, this product is equal to the product of all (1-1/p) for primes p that have at least one occurrence in [l, r].

If we can represent each prime's occurrences as a binary array (1 if present in that position, else 0), then for each query, we need to compute the product of (1-1/p) for all p where the sum of the binary array in [l, r] is >=1.

But this is equivalent to multiplying all (1-1/p) for which there's at least one 1 in their binary array in [l, r].

This can be modeled as a 2D problem: for each query [l, r], compute the product over p of (1-1/p) raised to the indicator function that there's at least one 1 in their binary array in [l, r].

But how to compute this product quickly.

Ah, here's an idea inspired by linear algebra:

The product can be rewritten as the product of all (1-1/p) for all p, multiplied by the product of 1/(1-1/p) for all p that do not appear in the range.

But this doesn't seem helpful either.

Alternatively, think of the product as the product of all (1-1/p) for all p in the entire array, divided by the product of (1-1/p) for all p that appear in the entire array but not in the range [l, r].

But again, this requires knowing which primes are not in the range, which is the same problem.

Another Idea: Use inclusion-exclusion with Mo's algorithm. Mo's algorithm processes queries in a way that adds/removes elements incrementally and keeps track of the current state. For this problem, the state would be the set of primes seen so far. For each element added, we factorize it and add its primes to the set. The product is then updated by multiplying (1-1/p) for any new primes. When removing an element, we factorize it and check if any of its primes are no longer present in the current range. However, this requires keeping track of the count of each prime in the current range. When a prime's count drops to zero, we multiply by 1/(1-1/p) to remove its contribution. But this approach has a problem: if a prime appears multiple times in the range, even if it's present in other elements, removing one occurrence (when it's part of a element being removed from the range) may not decrement its count to zero. Thus, we need to track the count of each prime in the current range.

Mo's algorithm has a time complexity of O((n * sqrt(q)) * K), where K is the time to add or remove an element. For n=2e5 and q=2e5, sqrt(q) is about 447, so total operations are 2e5 * 447 * K. If K is around 10 (number of primes per element), then it's 8.94e7 operations, which might be feasible.

But how to manage the counts and the product.

Let's think: For each element being added to the current range, factorize it into its primes. For each prime p in its factors:

- If p is not present in the current count (count is zero), then multiply the product by (1-1/p) mod MOD, and increment the count to 1.

- If p is already present (count >=1), then simply increment the count.

When removing an element:

- For each prime p in its factors:

  - Decrement the count. If the count becomes zero, multiply the product by the inverse of (1-1/p) mod MOD.

So, for each prime p, we track how many times it's present in the current range. However, since the same prime can appear in multiple elements, the count is the number of elements that contribute p. But for the product, we only care whether the count is >=1. So, this approach tracks the count accurately, and when the count transitions between 0 and 1 (or vice versa), we update the product.

But how to handle this correctly.

For example, when adding an element with p, if the current count is 0, multiply by (1-1/p). If it's 1 or more, do nothing. Similarly, when removing, if the count drops to 0, multiply by the inverse. Otherwise, do nothing.

This requires for each prime p, a count of how many times it's in the current range. The count is the number of elements in the current range that have p as a factor.

But each a_i may have multiple primes. So for each element being added or removed, we need to factorize it into its distinct primes (since adding the same prime multiple times in the same element won't affect the count—only once per element).

So during preprocessing, for each a_i, we factorize it into its set of distinct primes. Then, during Mo's algorithm processing, when adding or removing an element, we process each of its distinct primes.

This way, when adding an element, for each prime p in its factors:

- If the current count for p is zero, multiply the product by (1-1/p).

- Increment the count for p by 1.

When removing an element, for each prime p in its factors:

- Decrement the count for p by 1.

- If the new count is zero, multiply the product by the inverse of (1-1/p).

This ensures that the product only includes each prime p once, as long as p is present in at least one element of the current range.

But this approach requires factorizing each a_i once during preprocessing, and then during Mo's processing, for each element added or removed, processing its primes. The counts are tracked using a hash map or array.

Given that the primes are up to 1e6, using an array of size 1e6+1 to track counts is feasible. But 1e6 is 1 million entries, which is manageable.

Now, the steps would be:

1. Preprocess each a_i to factorize into its distinct primes. This can be done using sieve of Eratosthenes for factorization.

2. Order the queries using Mo's algorithm ordering to minimize the number of element additions and removals.

3. Process the queries in this order, maintaining a current product of (1-1/p) for primes in the current range, and a count array for primes.

4. For each query, once the current range matches the query's range, multiply the current product by the product of the a_i's in the range mod MOD. The product of the a_i's can be computed using prefix products and modular inverses.

But wait, the product of the a_i's mod MOD is separate and can be computed quickly using prefix products. So, for each query, the answer is (product_mod * product_primes) mod MOD.

So the steps are:

- Precompute the prefix product array modulo MOD.

- Precompute the modular inverses of the prefix product array.

- For each query [l, r], compute the product_mod as (prefix[r] * inv_prefix[l-1]) % MOD.

- The product_primes is the product of (1-1/p) for all primes p in the current range.

So during Mo's processing, for each query, after adjusting the current range to match l and r, compute product_primes, multiply by product_mod, and store the result.

Now, the time complexity of this approach depends on the number of operations required for adding/removing elements. Mo's algorithm typically has O(n * sqrt(q)) operations. For n=2e5 and q=2e5, sqrt(q) is about 447, so total operations are about 2e5 * 447 = 8.94e7. For each element added or removed, we process the primes in its factorization, which for a_i up to 1e6 is about 7 primes on average (for 1e6, the maximum number of distinct primes is 7, for 2^19, etc.). So total operations would be 8.94e7 * 7 ≈ 6.26e8 operations, which is tight for 3 seconds (3e8 operations per second), but might be manageable with optimizations.

But the key is to implement this efficiently. Let's outline the steps:

Preprocessing:

1. Compute the smallest prime factor (SPF) sieve up to 1e6 for factorization.

2. For each a_i in the array, factorize into its distinct primes using the sieve.

3. Precompute the prefix product array modulo MOD.

4. Precompute the inverse of each prefix product element modulo MOD.

Then, Mo's algorithm:

- Order the queries in a way that minimizes the number of element additions/removals. This usually involves sorting the queries into blocks of sqrt(n) size.

- Process the queries, maintaining a current l and r range, and adjusting them to match each query's l and r.

- For each adjustment (adding or removing an element), factorize the element into primes and update the count array and product_primes.

- For each query, compute the product_mod and multiply by product_primes to get the answer.

Now, the main challenges are:

- Factorizing each a_i into distinct primes quickly.

- Managing the count array and product_primes efficiently.

Let's think about factorization. For a_i=1, it has no primes. For a_i>1, using the sieve of smallest prime factors, we can factorize each a_i in O(number of primes) time.

For example, for a_i=24, we can get the factors 2, 3.

The count array can be a global array of size 1e6+1, initialized to 0.

The product_primes starts at 1. For each prime p added (count was 0), multiply by (1 - inv(p)) mod MOD. Here, inv(p) is the modular inverse of p. Because (1-1/p) mod MOD is equivalent to (p-1) * inv(p) mod MOD.

So for each prime p, we can precompute (p-1) * inv(p) mod MOD. This way, when a new prime p is added to the product_primes, we multiply by this value.

So steps:

1. Precompute for each prime p up to 1e6, the value (p-1) * inv(p) mod MOD. Also precompute the inverse of this value for when a prime is removed.

2. For each a_i in the array, factorize into its distinct primes and store them.

Implementing this:

First, precompute the sieve for smallest prime factors.

Then, for each a_i, factorize into its distinct primes.

For example, a_i=12 → 2 and 3.

Then, during Mo's algorithm processing, when adding an a_i, iterate through its primes, and for each p:

- If the count[p] is 0: multiply product_primes by (p-1)*inv(p) mod MOD.

- Increment count[p] by 1.

When removing an a_i, iterate through its primes, and for each p:

- Decrement count[p] by 1.

- If count[p] is now 0: multiply product_primes by the inverse of (p-1)*inv(p) mod MOD. The inverse can be precomputed.

But since (p-1)*inv(p) mod MOD is equal to (p-1) * inv(p), the inverse of this value is inv( (p-1) * inv(p) ) mod MOD. Which is inv(p-1) * p mod MOD. Because:

inv( (p-1) * inv(p) ) = inv(p-1) * p mod MOD.

So for each prime p, we can precompute:

- term[p] = (p-1) * inv(p) mod MOD

- inv_term[p] = inv(p-1) * p mod MOD

But wait, let's verify:

term[p] = (p-1) * inv(p) mod MOD

inv_term[p] = inv( term[p] ) mod MOD

So inv( (p-1) * inv(p) ) = inv( inv(p) * (p-1) ) = inv( (p-1) ) * p mod MOD.

Yes, since inv( a * b ) = inv(a) * inv(b).

So inv( (p-1) * inv(p) ) = inv(p-1) * inv( inv(p) ) = inv(p-1) * p mod MOD.

So we can precompute term[p] and inv_term[p] for each prime p.

But for non-prime numbers, when we factorize a_i, we get primes. So we only need to precompute term and inv_term for primes.

So during preprocessing:

For each prime p up to 1e6:

term[p] = (p-1) * pow(p, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD

inv_term[p] = pow(p-1, MOD-2, MOD) * p % MOD

But note that for p=2, term[p] is (1) * inv(2) mod MOD.

Now, during Mo's processing:

product_primes is initialized to 1.

count is a dictionary or array that tracks the count of each prime in the current range.

When adding an element (a_i's primes), for each prime p in a_i's factors:

if count[p] == 0:

    product_primes = (product_primes * term[p]) % MOD

count[p] += 1

When removing an element (a_i's primes), for each prime p in a_i's factors:

count[p] -= 1

if count[p] == 0:

    product_primes = (product_primes * inv_term[p]) % MOD

Now, the Mo's algorithm steps:

Sort the queries into blocks of size sqrt(n).

For each query in the sorted order, adjust the current l and r to match the query's l and r.

For example, start with l=0 and r=0, and for each query [curr_l, curr_r], move l and r towards the query's l and r, adding or removing elements as needed.

Each time an element is added or removed, process its primes.

Once the current range matches the query, compute the product_mod as (prefix[r] * inv_prefix[l-1]) % MOD, then multiply by product_primes mod MOD to get the answer.

So the key steps are:

Implementing Mo's algorithm with the above logic.

But Mo's algorithm can be slow for some query orderings, but with the standard block size of sqrt(n), it's generally efficient enough.

Now, for the code:

First, sieve of smallest prime factors.

Then, for each a_i, factorize into primes.

Precompute prefix product and inverse prefix product.

Precompute term and inv_term for all primes in the sieve.

Implement Mo's algorithm.

But there's a problem: if a_i is 1, it has no primes, so adding or removing it doesn't change the product_primes.

Now, code outline:

- Read n.

- Read the array a.

- Precompute sieve.

- For each a_i in a, factorize into distinct primes. Store as a list of primes lists.

- Precompute prefix product and inverse prefix.

- Precompute term and inv_term for primes.

- Read q queries.

- Sort queries using Mo's order.

- Process each query, adjusting the current range and maintaining product_primes.

- After each query, store the answer.

But implementing this requires handling the Mo's algorithm correctly.

But for handling the product_mod, we need to compute (prefix[r] * inv_prefix[l-1]) mod MOD.

Where prefix is an array where prefix[i] is the product of a[0] to a[i-1] (assuming 0-based or 1-based arrays).

So let's say the array is 1-based.

prefix[0] = 1

prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] * a[i-1] mod MOD for i >=1

Then, the product from l to r (inclusive) is prefix[r] * inv(prefix[l-1]) mod MOD.

But in Python, the pow function can compute the modular inverse.

So, inv_prefix[i] = pow(prefix[i], MOD-2, MOD)

Thus, for a query l to r (1-based), the product_mod is (prefix[r] * inv_prefix[l-1]) % MOD.

Now, code steps:

Implement sieve.

But sieve up to 1e6.

Then, for each a_i, factorize into primes.

For example, function to factorize:

def factorize(x):

    factors = set()

    if x == 1:

        return factors

    while x > 1:

        p = spf[x]

        factors.add(p)

        while x % p == 0:

            x //= p

    return factors

Then, for each a_i, store the factors.

Now, for Mo's algorithm:

The code will need to process the queries in a specific order. Mo's algorithm typically orders queries by block of sqrt(n), and within the same block, order by r if even block, and by -r if odd block.

But let's implement the standard Mo's algorithm.

But with n up to 2e5, the block size can be around 450.

The queries are sorted by block of l, and within the same block, sorted by r (with even blocks) or sorted by -r (with odd blocks), to minimize the movement of r.

But I'll use block size as sqrt(n) and sort queries by (l // block_size, r if (l // block_size) % 2 == 0 else -r).

But for the sake of code, let's proceed.

Now, the code will need to:

- Read the queries and store their indices.

- Sort the queries according to Mo's order.

- Initialize current l and r to 0.

- For each query in sorted order, move l and r to the desired positions, and update the product_primes.

But in Python, dictionaries and arrays are manageable. However, for speed, using an array for counts is better.

But primes up to 1e6, so using an array of size 1e6+1 for counts is feasible.

So:

count = [0] * (max_prime + 1)

But in Python, list initializations of size 1e6+1 are manageable.

But let's see: 1e6+1 integers, each 4 bytes, is about 4MB, which is manageable.

Now, code:

But the code has to be efficient. Let's proceed.

But given the time constraints, the code must be optimized.

Now, putting it all together:

First, sieve:

max_a = 1e6

spf = list(range(max_a+1))

for i in range(2, int(max_a**0.5)+1):

    if spf[i] == i:

        for j in range(i*i, max_a+1, i):

            if spf[j] == j:

                spf[j] = i

Then, factorize each a_i:

primes_list = []

for x in a:

    if x == 1:

        primes_list.append(set())

        continue

    factors = set()

    while x > 1:

        p = spf[x]

        factors.add(p)

        while x % p == 0:

            x = x // p

    primes_list.append(factors)

Then, prefix product:

mod = 10**9+7

prefix = [1]*(n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    prefix[i] = (prefix[i-1] * a[i-1]) % mod

inv_prefix = [1]*(n+1)

inv_prefix[0] = 1

for i in range(1, n+1):

    inv_prefix[i] = pow(prefix[i], mod-2, mod)

Precompute term and inv_term for primes:

primes = set()

for factors in primes_list:

    primes.update(factors)

prime_terms = {}

prime_inv_terms = {}

for p in primes:

    term_p = ((p-1) * pow(p, mod-2, mod)) % mod

    prime_terms[p] = term_p

    inv_term_p = (pow(p-1, mod-2, mod) * p) % mod

    prime_inv_terms[p] = inv_term_p

But in Python, dictionaries have faster access than lists for large p.

Alternatively, for all possible p up to 1e6, precompute term and inv_term, even if they are not used.

But since the sieve can generate all primes up to 1e6, perhaps precompute for all primes in the sieve.

But this would take time. For code, perhaps it's better to generate term and inv_term for all possible p in the sieve.

But given the time, it's better to precompute for all primes up to 1e6.

So:

max_p = 10**6

term = [0]*(max_p+1)

inv_term = [0]*(max_p+1)

for p in range(2, max_p+1):

    if spf[p] == p:  # p is prime

        term[p] = ( (p-1) * pow(p, mod-2, mod) ) % mod

        inv_term[p] = ( pow(p-1, mod-2, mod) * p ) % mod

    else:

        term[p] = 0  # not a prime, won't be used

        inv_term[p] = 0

But this way, even non-primes have entries, but they are zero and not used.

Now, during Mo's processing:

current_l = 1

current_r = 0

product_primes = 1

count = [0]*(max_p +1)

answers = [0]*q

sorted_queries = sorted(enumerate(queries), key=lambda x: (x[1][0] // block_size, x[1][1] if (x[1][0] // block_size) %2 ==0 else -x[1][1]))

for idx, (l, r) in sorted_queries:

    while current_l > l:

        current_l -= 1

        for p in primes_list[current_l-1]:

            if count[p] == 0:

                product_primes = (product_primes * term[p]) % mod

            count[p] +=1

    while current_r < r:

        current_r +=1

        for p in primes_list[current_r-1]:

            if count[p] == 0:

                product_primes = (product_primes * term[p]) % mod

            count[p] +=1

    while current_l < l:

        for p in primes_list[current_l-1]:

            count[p] -=1

            if count[p] ==0:

                product_primes = (product_primes * inv_term[p]) % mod

        current_l +=1

    while current_r > r:

        for p in primes_list[current_r-1]:

            count[p] -=1

            if count[p] ==0:

                product_primes = (product_primes * inv_term[p]) % mod

        current_r -=1

    product_mod = (prefix[r] * inv_prefix[l-1]) % mod

    answer = (product_mod * product_primes) % mod

    answers[idx] = answer

Then, after processing all queries, output the answers in order.

But the problem is that in Python, for large n and q, this code may be too slow. Mo's algorithm is already O(n sqrt q), and with the nested loops, it's possible that this will TLE in Python.

But given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible approach.

But there's an alternative: Precompute for each position i, the product of the a_i's mod MOD, and precompute for each prime p the prefix array indicating whether it's present up to i.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Since the product of the a_i's mod MOD can be computed quickly, the only problem is the product of (1-1/p) for the primes in the range.

If we can represent this product as a bitmask and use a binary indexed tree or a segment tree that can combine these products, but given the number of primes, this is impossible.

Alternatively, for each position i, store the primes in a_i, and for each query, collect all primes in the range, and multiply their (1-1/p) terms. But in Python, even with a set, for large ranges, this will be too slow.

Thus, the only feasible solution is the Mo's algorithm approach.

But implementing this in Python may be too slow. So, let's proceed with the code, but optimize as much as possible.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

Read the array a.

Precompute the sieve.

Factorize each a_i into its distinct primes.

Precompute prefix and inv_prefix.

Precompute term and inv_term for all primes up to 1e6.

Read q queries.

Sort the queries using Mo's order.

Process the queries using Mo's algorithm, maintaining count and product_primes.

Output the answers in the original order.

But in Python, the main problem is speed. For 2e5 queries, each requiring O(1) steps after processing, but each step requiring moving l and r through elements and processing their primes.

But for Python, the code may be too slow.

But the problem requires an optimal solution, and this is the best approach I can think of.

So, the final code is as follows.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the Euler's totient function for the product of elements in a given range of an array, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Given the constraints, a direct approach of computing the product and then applying the totient function is infeasible due to the large input size. Instead, we use a combination of precomputation and Mo's algorithm to handle range queries efficiently.

### Approach
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Precompute the smallest prime factor (SPF) for every number up to \(10^6\) to quickly factorize elements of the array.
2. **Factorization**: For each element in the array, precompute its distinct prime factors using the SPF array.
3. **Prefix Products**: Compute prefix products modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to quickly get the product of elements in any range.
4. **Mo's Algorithm**: Use Mo's algorithm to process range queries efficiently. This algorithm reorders queries to minimize the number of element additions/removals, maintaining a running product of the required totient terms.

### Explanation
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This precomputes the smallest prime factor for every number up to \(10^6\), allowing efficient factorization of each element in the array.
2. **Factorization**: Each element is factorized into its distinct primes using the precomputed sieve.
3. **Prefix Products**: These allow quick computation of the product of any subarray modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using modular arithmetic.
4. **Mo's Algorithm**: This algorithm processes queries in an order that minimizes the number of element additions and removals. For each query, we maintain a count of primes and adjust the product of totient terms dynamically as elements are added or removed from the current range.

This approach ensures that each query is processed efficiently, leveraging precomputation and smart query ordering to handle large input sizes within the constraints.
