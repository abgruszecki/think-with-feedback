<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to calculate the sum of n mod i for i from 1 to m. The problem is that n and m can be up to 1e13, which is way too big for a straightforward loop. So I have to find a smarter way to compute this sum without iterating through each term.

Hmm, right. The mod operation n mod i is equal to n - i * floor(n/i). So the sum from i=1 to m of (n mod i) is equal to sum(n) - sum(i * floor(n/i)), but summed over i from 1 to m. Wait, but sum(n) over m terms is n*m. So the total sum S = n*m - sum_{i=1 to m} (i * floor(n/i)).

So the problem reduces to efficiently computing the sum of i * floor(n/i) for i from 1 to m. Then subtract that from n*m and take mod 1e9+7.

The key is how to compute that sum efficiently. For large m and n, directly iterating from 1 to m is impossible. So I need a mathematical approach here.

Let's think about the floor(n/i) term. For different ranges of i, floor(n/i) can be the same. For example, when i is between k and n/(k), the value of floor(n/i) might be the same. So we can split the summation into intervals where floor(n/i) is constant and compute the sum for each interval.

Wait, but how to find those intervals? Let's say for a particular value of q = floor(n/i), then all i in [k, l] will have q as their floor(n/i). Then, for each such q, we can compute the sum over those i's of i * q. But how to find all possible q's and their ranges?

Alternatively, note that floor(n/i) can only take on O(2*sqrt(n)) different values. Because when i is up to sqrt(n), floor(n/i) can vary from 1 to sqrt(n). And when i is larger than sqrt(n), the floor(n/i) is less than sqrt(n), so the total number of distinct values is about 2*sqrt(n). So maybe we can split the sum into two parts: i up to sqrt(n), and i greater than sqrt(n). But how?

Alternatively, let's approach the problem by grouping terms with the same q = floor(n/i). For each possible q, find the range of i where floor(n/i) = q. Then, the sum over i in that range would be q * sum(i) over the i's in the range. But since m can be up to 1e13, we need to also account for m possibly cutting off some of the ranges.

Wait, but m can be larger than n. So when i > n, floor(n/i) is zero. So for i > n, the term i * floor(n/i) is zero. So in that case, when m exceeds n, those terms (i from n+1 to m) contribute nothing. So the sum from i=1 to m is the sum from i=1 to min(m, n) of i * floor(n/i). So perhaps the first step is to compute m' = min(m, n). Then the sum becomes sum_{i=1 to m'} (i * floor(n/i)).

So the problem is now to compute this sum for m' = min(m, n). Then, subtract this sum from n * m, and take modulo 1e9+7.

Now, the sum is sum_{i=1 to m'} i * floor(n / i). Let's call this sum S. To compute S efficiently.

The classic approach here is to split the sum into two parts: when floor(n/i) is large (i.e., i is small) and when it's small (i is large). For each possible q, find all i where floor(n/i) = q. Then, sum over q and multiply by q * sum of i in that range.

But how to iterate through the q values and find the ranges of i where floor(n/i) is q.

Alternatively, for each possible q, the values of i that satisfy q = floor(n/i) are i in [k, l], where k = floor(n/(q+1)) + 1 and l = floor(n/q). But I need to make sure that this interval is within 1 to m'.

So here's the plan:

We can iterate over all possible q's where q is the value of floor(n/i). For each q, find the interval of i's where floor(n/i) = q. Then, compute the sum of i in that interval (within the range 1 to m') multiplied by q, and add that to the total.

The question is, how to efficiently iterate through all possible q's and their corresponding i ranges.

Alternatively, note that for i from 1 to m', the possible values of floor(n/i) can be grouped. Let's see.

Let me consider that for q in 1 to sqrt(n), we can handle each q and find the i's that correspond to it. For q larger than sqrt(n), the corresponding i's are small (since i = floor(n/q), which would be small for large q). So perhaps the approach is to split the sum into two parts: i up to sqrt(n) and i above sqrt(n). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, iterate over q from 1 to sqrt(n), then for each q, find the i's where floor(n/i) = q. Then, for i's where floor(n/i) is less than sqrt(n), group them. Hmm, perhaps this is a standard approach in such problems.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

The sum S = sum_{i=1 to m'} (i * floor(n/i)).

We can split this sum into two parts:

1. For i where floor(n/i) >= k (k is a threshold, like sqrt(n))
2. For i where floor(n/i) < k.

But how to choose k. Let's choose k as sqrt(n), so that for the first part, each q >= k will have i <= n/q <= sqrt(n), which is manageable. For the second part, q < k, so the number of q's is up to k.

But perhaps a better way is to note that for q >= sqrt(n), the corresponding i's are i <= n/q <= sqrt(n). So for these i's, each q corresponds to a unique i. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, for each i <= sqrt(n), compute the term i * floor(n/i) directly, since there are O(sqrt(n)) such terms. Then, for the remaining i's (i > sqrt(n)), note that floor(n/i) can be at most sqrt(n). So for each possible value of q (from 1 to floor(n/(sqrt(n)+1)) ), find the number of i's in the range (sqrt(n), m'] where floor(n/i) = q, and sum q * sum(i) over those i's.

Wait, perhaps that's manageable.

So here's the plan:

Compute all i up to k (where k is sqrt(n)), add their contributions to S. Then, for q from 1 to q_max (where q_max is floor(n/(k+1)) ), find the range of i's where floor(n/i) = q, and i >k. But need to handle the case where m' is smaller than certain values.

Wait, perhaps splitting into two parts:

1. i <= k: compute each term directly. k can be up to sqrt(n), but since n can be 1e13, sqrt(n) is 1e6.5, which is 3e6 for n=1e13. So 1e6 steps is manageable. For example, if k is 1e6, even 1e6 iterations are okay.

2. For q from 1 to q_max, where q_max is floor(n/(k+1)), compute the sum of i * q for i in the range [L, R], where L is max(k+1, floor(n/(q+1)) + 1 ), R is min( floor(n/q), m' ). But wait, for each q, the i's that satisfy floor(n/i) = q are those i in [floor(n/(q+1)) +1, floor(n/q)].

But for the second part, after handling i <=k, q must be <= floor(n/(k+1)), which is <= floor(n/(sqrt(n)+1)) ) ~ sqrt(n). So for q in 1 to q_max, each q can be handled in O(1) time, and the number of q's is O(sqrt(n)), which is manageable.

So the steps would be:

Compute S = sum_{i=1 to min(m, n)} i * floor(n/i)

Split into two parts:

- i <= k (k = sqrt(n)), compute each term directly.

- For i >k: group by q = floor(n/i). For each q, find the range of i's (L, R) where floor(n/i) = q and i >k. Then, sum q * sum(i from L to R), but only if L <= R and R <= m'.

But how to compute q for i >k. Since for i >k, q = floor(n/i) < floor(n/k) = q0. Since k is sqrt(n), q0 is about sqrt(n). So the q's here are up to sqrt(n).

But perhaps the key is to loop q from 1 to q_max, where q_max is floor(n/(k+1)), and for each q, compute L and R as:

L = floor(n/(q+1)) + 1

R = floor(n/q)

But we need to ensure that i is in [k+1, m'].

So for each q, the valid i's are between L and R, but also >= k+1 and <= min(R, m').

So the actual L and R for this q would be:

L_adj = max(L, k+1)

R_adj = min(R, m')

If L_adj > R_adj, then this q contributes nothing. Otherwise, the sum for this q is q * sum from L_adj to R_adj.

The sum from L_adj to R_adj is (L_adj + R_adj) * (R_adj - L_adj +1) // 2.

So for each q in 1 to q_max:

compute L and R as per the formula.

adjust L and R to be within i >k and <= m'.

sum += q * (sum of i from L_adj to R_adj).

But how to compute q_max?

q_max is the maximum possible q where i >k.

Since i >k => i >=k+1. So floor(n/i) <= floor(n/(k+1)).

So q_max = floor(n/(k+1)).

But wait, if k is sqrt(n), then n/(k+1) is approximately sqrt(n), so q_max is O(sqrt(n)).

So the total number of q's in the second part is O(sqrt(n)), which is manageable.

So putting this all together:

k = int(n**0.5)

sum_part1 = sum( i * (n // i) for i in range(1, k+1) if i <= m_prime )

But wait, m_prime is min(m, n). So for i in 1 to k, but if m_prime < i, then we shouldn't include those terms. So in part1, we have to loop i from 1 to min(k, m_prime).

Wait, but if m is less than k, then part1 would loop up to m_prime, and part2 may not be needed.

Wait, m_prime is the minimum of m and n. So for part1, we need to loop from i=1 to min(k, m_prime). Because if m_prime is smaller than k, then we can't go up to k.

So part1 is:

sum_part1 = 0

for i in 1 to min(k, m_prime):

   sum_part1 += i * (n // i)

sum_part2 is computed as:

q_max = n // (k+1)

sum_part2 = 0

for q in 1 to q_max:

   L = (n // (q + 1)) + 1

   R = n // q

   L_adj = max(L, k+1)

   R_adj = min(R, m_prime)

   if L_adj > R_adj:

       continue

   sum_i = (L_adj + R_adj) * (R_adj - L_adj + 1) // 2

   sum_part2 += q * sum_i

Then total sum S = sum_part1 + sum_part2.

But wait, the q in part2 can be up to q_max, which could be up to n/(k+1). Since k is sqrt(n), n/(k+1) is around sqrt(n). So the loop for q runs up to sqrt(n) steps.

So the total time is O(k) for part1 and O(sqrt(n)) for part2. Which for n up to 1e13 would be O(1e6 + 1e6) steps, which is manageable.

Now, considering the constraints:

n and m can be up to 1e13. So even with 2e6 steps, it's acceptable for Python, given that each step is a simple calculation.

But we need to handle cases where m is less than k. For example, if m_prime is 5 and k is 1e6, then part1 runs up to 5, and part2 would have q_max = n//(k+1) which could be large. Wait, but in part2, when m_prime is less than k+1, then L_adj would be set to max(L, k+1) which is k+1, which is larger than m_prime. So R_adj would be min(R, m_prime), which is m_prime. But since L_adj > R_adj (because k+1 > m_prime), then part2 contributes nothing.

So the code will correctly handle that.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input: 3 4

n=3, m=4. m_prime = min(4,3)=3.

k = sqrt(3) ~1.732, so k=1.

sum_part1: i runs from 1 to 1 (since min(k=1, m_prime=3) is 1).

i=1: 1*(3//1) = 1*3=3. sum_part1=3.

q_max =3//(1+1) =3//2=1.

So part2 loops q from 1 to 1.

For q=1:

L = 3//(1+1) +1 = 3//2 +1=1 +1=2.

R =3//1=3.

L_adj = max(2, 1+1)=2.

R_adj = min(3,3) =3.

sum_i = (2+3)*2//2 =5*2//2=5.

sum_part2 += 1*5=5.

Total sum_part1+part2=3+5=8. So S=8.

Then the total sum mod is 3*4 -8=12-8=4 mod 1e9+7=4. Which matches the sample.

Another sample: input 4 4.

n=4, m=4. m_prime=4.

k=2 (sqrt(4) is 2).

sum_part1: i=1 to 2.

i=1:1*4=4.

i=2:2*2=4. sum_part1=8.

q_max=4//(2+1)=4//3=1.

q runs from 1 to 1.

For q=1:

L=4//2 +1=2+1=3.

R=4//1=4.

L_adj = max(3,3) =3.

R_adj = min(4,4) =4.

sum_i=(3+4)*2//2=7*2//2=7.

sum_part2 +=1*7=7.

Total S=8+7=15.

Total sum mod is 4*4 -15 =16-15=1. Which matches the sample.

Another sample: input 1 1.

n=1, m=1. m_prime=1.

k=1.

sum_part1: i=1. 1*1=1.

q_max=1//(1+1)=0. So part2 loops from 1 to 0, which is not executed. So sum_part2=0.

S=1.

n*m=1*1=1. 1-1=0. Correct.

So the approach works for the samples.

Now, considering that m can be larger than n. For example, if m=1e13 and n=5. Then m_prime=5.

k is sqrt(5)=2. sum_part1 is i=1,2. Then part2 would loop q from 1 to 5//3=1. So for q=1, L=5//(1+1)+1=2+1=3. R=5//1=5. L_adj=3 (since k+1=3). R_adj=5 (since m_prime=5). sum_i from 3 to5: sum is 3+4+5=12. sum_part2=1*12=12. Total sum_part1+part2= (1*5 + 2*2) +12 =5+4+12=21. Then n*m=5*1e13, but since m is larger than n, the actual sum is 5*1e13 -21. But in the code, since m' is min(m, n), which is 5, so the code would compute S=21. The sum mod is 5*5-21=25-21=4. So yes.

Now, code implementation.

First, compute m_prime = min(m, n). Then, compute k as the integer part of the square root of n.

Then sum_part1 is the sum of i * (n//i) for i from 1 to min(k, m_prime).

Then, compute q_max = n // (k +1) if k+1 !=0. But if k+1 is zero (n=0?), but according to constraints, n >=1. So no problem.

Then, for q in 1 to q_max:

compute L = (n // (q+1)) +1.

R = n // q.

Then adjust L to be at least k+1, and R to be at most m_prime.

If L_adj <= R_adj, compute sum_i = (L_adj + R_adj) * (R_adj - L_adj +1) // 2, multiply by q, add to sum_part2.

So code steps:

Read n, m.

Compute m_prime = min(m, n).

Compute k = int(n ** 0.5).

sum_part1 = 0

for i in 1 to min(k, m_prime):

sum_part1 += i * (n // i)

sum_part2 =0

q_max = n // (k+1) if k+1 !=0 else 0.

But when k is sqrt(n), k+1 is sqrt(n)+1. For example, if n is a square, like 4, then k is 2, k+1=3. So n//(k+1) is 4//3=1.

So code:

q_max = n // (k + 1)

for q in range(1, q_max +1):

   L = (n // (q +1)) +1

   R = n // q

   L_adj = max(L, k +1)

   R_adj = min(R, m_prime)

   if L_adj > R_adj:

       continue

   count = R_adj - L_adj +1

   sum_i = (L_adj + R_adj) * count //2

   sum_part2 += q * sum_i

Then total_S = sum_part1 + sum_part2.

The final answer is (n * m - total_S) % MOD, where MOD is 1e9+7.

But wait, n*m can be up to 1e13 *1e13 =1e26, which is way beyond the limit of a 64-bit integer. But in Python, integers can handle that. Then subtract total_S and take mod 1e9+7.

But wait, when m is larger than n, the original sum is sum_{i=1 to m} n mod i. But for i >n, n mod i is n, but that's not the case. Wait, no. For i>n, n mod i is n, because when you divide n by i (which is larger than n), the quotient is 0, remainder is n. So n mod i =n for i>n.

But wait, the original problem says sum from i=1 to m of (n mod i). So if m >n, then:

sum_{i=1 to m} (n mod i) = sum_{i=1 to n} (n mod i) + sum_{i=n+1 to m} n.

Because for i>n, n mod i is n.

So sum(n mod i for i=1..m) = sum(n mod i for i=1..n) + (m -n) *n, if m >n.

But in our code, when m_prime is min(m, n). So in code, the sum S is sum_part1 + sum_part2, which is sum_{i=1 to m_prime} i * floor(n/i). Then the original sum is n*m_prime - S. Then, if m >n, the total sum is (n*m_prime - S) + n*(m -n).

Because:

sum_{i=1 to m} (n mod i) = [sum_{i=1 to n} (n mod i)] + [sum_{i=n+1 to m} n] 

Which is (n*n - S) + (m -n)*n 

= n*(n) - S + n*(m -n) 

= n*m - S.

But S is computed as sum_{i=1 to n} i*floor(n/i) (since m_prime is n). So the code's original approach is correct.

Wait, no. Wait when m >n, then m_prime =n, so the code computes sum_{i=1 to n} i*floor(n/i). Then the original sum is sum mod i from 1 to m is (n*m - S) + (m-n)*n. Wait, no:

sum mod i from 1 to m is sum mod i from 1 to n (which is n*n - S) plus sum mod i from n+1 to m (each term is n). So total sum is (n^2 - S) + (m -n)*n.

But according to the code's approach:

sum_part = S = sum_{i=1 to m'} i*floor(n/i) where m' = min(m, n) =n.

So the code's answer is (n * m - S) % MOD. But when m >n, m is larger than n, so the code's answer is (n *m - S) which equals (n^2 - S) + n*(m -n) → which is correct. Because:

n *m is the sum of n over m terms (n * m), but the code subtracts S (sum of i*floor(n/i) from 1 to n). So the code correctly computes (n*m - S) even when m >n.

So the code's approach is correct in all cases.

Thus, the code can proceed as written.

Now, code in Python:

We need to read n and m, compute m_prime = min(m, n), compute k as sqrt(n), then compute sum_part1 and sum_part2.

But in Python, for very large n, sqrt(n) can be computed as int(n**0.5), but we need to ensure that k is the integer part. So perhaps:

k = int(n ** 0.5)

while (k+1) * (k+1) <=n:

   k +=1

But for n up to 1e13, even this loop would be O(1) steps. Alternatively, using math.isqrt in Python 3.8+ which returns the integer square root. For example, math.isqrt(3) returns 1. So perhaps using math.isqrt(n) would be better.

But since the problem says to use input() and print(), which are standard, and code is to be in Python 3, perhaps the code can use math.isqrt.

But given that n can be up to 1e13, the code needs to compute k as the integer part of the square root.

Let me see:

import math

n = 3

k = math.isqrt(n) → 1.

n=4 → 2.

Yes. So code can use math.isqrt(n).

But in Python, for n up to 1e26, math.isqrt is okay.

So code:

import math

n, m = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 10**9 +7

m_prime = min(m, n)

if m_prime ==0:

   print(0)

   exit()

k = math.isqrt(n)

sum_part1 =0

upper_i = min(k, m_prime)

for i in range(1, upper_i +1):

   sum_part1 += i * (n //i)

sum_part1 %= MOD  # To prevent overflow?

Wait, but even sum_part1 can be up to 1e13 *1e13 for each term. For example, n=1e13, i=1, then term is 1e13. Summing up for k=1e6 terms would sum up to 1e19, which is manageable in Python.

But when added to sum_part2 (another 1e19), the total could be up to 1e26. Then subtracting from n*m (up to 1e26) could result in 1e26. Then mod 1e9+7 would be okay.

But in Python, even big integers are handled, so no problem.

But during computation, taking modulo at each step might not be necessary, but for the final result, the answer is (n*m - S) % MOD. So perhaps compute S as the sum, then compute (n*m - S) mod MOD.

But in code:

total_S = sum_part1 + sum_part2

result = (n * m - total_S) % MOD

But when m is up to 1e13 and n up to 1e13, n*m can be 1e26. So in Python, it's okay to compute that.

But when we compute (n *m) % MOD, but we need to compute (n *m - S) mod MOD. So perhaps compute ( (n % MOD) * (m % MOD) % MOD - (total_S % MOD) ) % MOD. But no, because (a - b) mod MOD can be negative. So better to compute:

result = ( (n * m - total_S) % MOD + MOD ) % MOD

This ensures the result is positive.

So code:

result = ( (n * m - total_S) % MOD + MOD ) % MOD

print(result)

Now, code for sum_part2:

q_max = n // (k +1) if k +1 !=0 else 0

sum_part2 =0

for q in range(1, q_max +1):

   L = (n // (q +1)) +1

   R = n // q

   L_adj = max(L, k+1)

   R_adj = min(R, m_prime)

   if L_adj > R_adj:

       continue

   count = R_adj - L_adj +1

   sum_i = (L_adj + R_adj) * count //2

   sum_part2 += q * sum_i

But in Python, q can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.

Testing this code with sample 1:

Sample 1: n=3, m=4. m_prime=3.

k =1.

sum_part1: i from 1 to 1. 1*3=3.

q_max =3//(1+1) =1.

loop q from1 to1:

L=(3//2)+1=1+1=2.

R=3//1=3.

L_adj = max(2,2) →2.

R_adj=min(3,3) →3.

count=3-2+1=2.

sum_i = (2+3)*2//2=5*2//2=5.

sum_part2=1*5=5.

total_S=3+5=8.

result=(3*4 -8) mod 1e9+7 → (12-8)=4 →4.

Sample 2: n=4, m=4.

k=2.

sum_part1: i=1,2. 1*4=4, 2*2=4. sum_part1=8.

q_max=4//3=1.

q=1:

L=4//2 +1=2+1=3.

R=4//1=4.

L_adj=3, R_adj=4.

sum_i=(3+4)*2//2=7*2//2=7.

sum_part2=7*1=7.

total_S=8+7=15.

result=16-15=1.

Sample 3: n=1, m=1.

m_prime=1.

k=1.

sum_part1: i=1, 1*1=1.

q_max=1//2=0. So loop not executed.

total_S=1.

result=1*1 -1 =0.

So code works for samples.

Now, edge cases.

Test case where m=0: but constraints say m >=1. So no.

Test case where n=1e13, m=1e13.

But code can handle it.

Another test case where n=1e13, m=1e13. m_prime=1e13.

k=1e6 (since sqrt(1e13) is 1e6.5? Wait 1e6 squared is 1e12, 1e7 squared is 1e14. So sqrt(1e13) is 1e6.5, which is 31622776. So for n=1e13, k=31622776.

sum_part1 is sum from i=1 to 3e7 terms. Which is 3e7 iterations. But in Python, 3e7 steps would take too long. Wait, but 3e7 steps is 30 million steps. Each step is a simple division and addition. In Python, this would take maybe 3 seconds, but the problem has a time limit of 2 seconds. So this approach would be too slow for the worst case.

Wait, this is a problem. Because for n=1e13, k= sqrt(n) is about 1e6. So part1 loops up to 1e6 steps, which is manageable. Wait wait, no. sqrt(1e13) is 10^6.5 which is 31622776. So k is 31,622,776. So sum_part1 would loop 31 million steps, which is way too slow for Python. Because even 1e8 operations are about 10 seconds. So 3e7 steps would take 3 seconds, which is over the time limit.

Hmm, this is a problem. So the approach is O(k) steps, which is O(1e6) for n up to 1e13. Wait, no. Wait 1e13's square root is 1e6.5, which is about 3.16e6. So k is 3e6 steps. For Python, 3e6 steps in a loop would take around 0.3 seconds. Because each iteration is simple: compute i, compute n//i, multiply by i, add to sum_part1. So perhaps acceptable.

But let's think: how much time does it take for 1e6 iterations in Python. Each iteration is a few operations. Testing in Python, a loop of 1e6 iterations takes about 0.1 seconds. So 3e6 iterations would take about 0.3 seconds. Then part2 has up to 3e6 steps again? No, part2's q_max is n/(k+1). For n=1e13, k+1 is 3e6 +1. So q_max is 1e13/(3e6+1) ≈ 3e6. So part2's loop is up to 3e6 steps. So total steps are 6e6, which would take about 0.6 seconds in Python. Which is acceptable for 2 seconds.

But wait, wait. For n=1e13 and k=3e6:

k+1 is 3e6 +1.

q_max = n//(k+1) = 1e13 // (3e6 +1) ≈ 3,333,333. So part2 would have to loop 3.3 million times. Each loop iteration has several steps: compute L and R, adjust them, compute sum_i, etc. Each of these steps is a few operations, but in Python, each loop iteration could take some time.

So for 3e6 steps, each taking 1e-6 seconds (which is 1 microsecond), the total would be 3e6 * 1e-6 = 3 seconds. Which is over the time limit.

So this approach may not work for Python for the largest input sizes.

So this approach is O(2*sqrt(n)) steps, which for n=1e13 is about 6e6 steps, but in Python, each step is expensive. So perhaps this code would TLE for the largest test cases.

Therefore, we need a more optimized approach.

Alternative approach:

We can find that when q is large, the number of i's is small. So maybe the part2 can be optimized by iterating over possible q's in a way that reduces the number of steps.

Alternatively, notice that in part2, q ranges from 1 to q_max. And for each q, we calculate the sum of i in [L_adj, R_adj]. But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute all possible q's and their ranges.

Alternatively, think of the sum as sum_{q=1 to q_max} q * sum_{i in I_q} i.

But how to compute this more efficiently.

Another idea: for the sum_part2, the i's are all >= k+1. So i ranges from k+1 to m_prime.

So sum_part2 is sum_{i=k+1 to m_prime} i * floor(n/i).

But floor(n/i) for i >=k+1 can be up to floor(n/(k+1)) which is q_max.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternatively, let's note that for i >=k+1, the possible values of floor(n/i) are all <=k.

Because when i >k, then floor(n/i) < floor(n/k). Since k is the integer sqrt(n), floor(n/k) is approximately sqrt(n). So q_max is floor(n/(k+1)) which is about sqrt(n).

Thus, the number of distinct q's is up to sqrt(n), which is manageable.

But perhaps we can iterate over the possible q's and compute the sum in O(1) per q.

Alternatively, the code can compute sum_part2 by grouping i's where floor(n/i) is q. For each q, the i's are in a certain range. The code is already doing that, but maybe the loop can be optimized.

But the code as written may not be efficient enough for Python for the largest possible input.

So what's the alternative?

Alternative approach:

The sum S = sum_{i=1 to m'} i * floor(n/i).

We can compute this sum by grouping terms where floor(n/i) = q. For each q, the range of i's that give q is [L, R], where L = floor(n/(q+1)) +1 and R = floor(n/q). Then, for each such q, the sum is q * sum_{i=L to R} i.

But the key is to iterate over q, but find the q's in a way that covers all possible i's from 1 to m'.

But how to find all q's.

This approach is similar to the original code's part1 and part2. The original code's part1 handles i<=k and part2 handles q<= q_max (which corresponds to i>k).

But perhaps part1 can be optimized.

Wait, but perhaps the code can handle all q's in a single loop, regardless of whether i is small or large.

Wait, in the sum S, the terms are grouped by q = floor(n/i). So for each q, the sum is q multiplied by the sum of i where floor(n/i) = q and 1<=i<=m'.

So the total sum can be computed as:

sum_{q=0 to q_max} q * sum_{i in I_q} i,

where I_q is the set of i's in [1, m'] where floor(n/i) = q.

So the problem is to find all q's and compute sum_i for their I_q.

But how to find all q's and their I_q.

The possible q's are from 0 to n. But for q=0, floor(n/i) is 0 only when i>n. But m' is min(m, n), so I_q for q=0 is empty. So q ranges from 1 to q_max = floor(n/1) =n.

But that's O(n) steps, which is impossible.

So we need a way to find all q's that are present in the sum.

The key is that for q >=1, the ranges of i where floor(n/i)=q are:

i in [floor(n/(q+1)) +1, floor(n/q)].

But for i <=m', so the upper bound is min(floor(n/q), m').

So for each q, the i's are in [L, R], where L = floor(n/(q+1)) +1, R = floor(n/q).

But for this interval to be valid, L <= R and R >=1.

But for q, the minimal possible is 1. Maximal possible q is floor(n/1) =n.

But this is O(n) steps, which is impossible.

So we need a way to iterate through all possible q's in O(sqrt(n)) steps.

The solution is to note that for q <= sqrt(n), the corresponding R is >= sqrt(n). But for q > sqrt(n), the R is < sqrt(n). So q can be split into two regions.

Thus, the approach is:

For q in 1 to sqrt(n), compute the sum for i in [L, R] where L and R are as defined.

Then, for i in 1 to sqrt(n), compute the sum for q = floor(n/i), but for each i here, q can be up to n. However, if q is larger than sqrt(n), then i must be <= floor(n/q) < sqrt(n). So for these q's, the corresponding i's are <= sqrt(n). But these i's have already been handled in the first part.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Another way to think:

The possible q's can be divided into two parts:

1. q <= sqrt(n): each q can be handled as per their L and R.

2. i <= sqrt(n): each i in 1 to sqrt(n) can be handled, and for each i, q=floor(n/i). But q can be larger than sqrt(n).

Wait, perhaps not. Because for i <= sqrt(n), q = floor(n/i) >= floor(n/sqrt(n)) = sqrt(n). So q >= sqrt(n). So the q's for i <= sqrt(n) are all >= sqrt(n). So, the first part handles q <= sqrt(n), and the second part handles i <= sqrt(n) (and their q's >= sqrt(n)).

But to avoid double counting, perhaps the sum can be split into two parts:

- For q <= sqrt(n): handle as before.

- For i <= sqrt(n): add i * q, where q = floor(n/i).

But the i's in the second part have q >= sqrt(n). But since q is floor(n/i) and i <= sqrt(n), q >= sqrt(n). So these q's are in the range [sqrt(n), n]. But handling all possible q's in this range is impossible.

But wait, the sum for i <= sqrt(n) is sum_{i=1 to min(k, m')} i * floor(n/i), which is exactly part1 of the original code. And part2 handles q's up to floor(n/(k+1)), which is for i >=k+1.

So the code as written is correct, but the problem is that for n=1e13, the part1 loop runs 3e6 steps, which in Python may be too slow.

So, how to optimize part1?

In Python, loops are slow. So perhaps using mathematical formulas to compute the sum_part1.

But how?

Sum_part1 is sum_{i=1 to k} i * floor(n/i), where k is the integer sqrt(n). But what if we can find a way to compute this sum more efficiently than iterating each i?

Alternatively, can we find a way to group terms in part1 similar to part2?

For example, for i in 1 to k, floor(n/i) can be grouped into ranges where the value is the same, and compute the sum for each group.

But for i up to k, floor(n/i) can vary up to n (when i=1). But the number of possible groups may be up to 2*sqrt(n), which is manageable.

Wait, for example, for i in 1 to k, q = floor(n/i). For each q, the i's are in the range [floor(n/(q+1)) +1, floor(n/q)].

But in this case, since i ranges up to k, we can iterate over q and find all i's in 1 to k that have floor(n/i) = q.

But for each q, the i's would be in the range [L, R] as before, but R is min( floor(n/q), k).

So sum_part1 can be computed by:

for q in possible values of floor(n/i) where i <=k:

   L = floor(n/(q+1)) +1

   R = floor(n/q)

   L_adj = max(L, 1)

   R_adj = min(R, k)

   if L_adj > R_adj:

       continue

   sum_i = sum of i from L_adj to R_adj.

   sum_part1 += q * sum_i

The number of q's here would be O(2*sqrt(n)), but since q can be up to n (when i=1), but for i<=k, q >= floor(n/k) = q0. So q0 is around sqrt(n). For example, when i <=k=sqrt(n), floor(n/i) >= floor(n/k) = floor(sqrt(n)), which is around sqrt(n). So the number of q's in part1 is O(sqrt(n)), which is manageable.

So the code can compute sum_part1 and sum_part2 using the same approach, grouped by q.

This way, both sum_part1 and sum_part2 are computed using the same grouped approach, which reduces the total number of steps from O(k + q_max) to O(number of groups for part1 + number of groups for part2), which is O(sqrt(n)) for both parts.

This would significantly reduce the number of iterations in Python, making it feasible for large inputs.

So the plan is:

Compute sum_part1 by grouping i's into ranges where floor(n/i) is q, for i from 1 to k.

Compute sum_part2 by grouping i's into ranges where floor(n/i) is q, for i from k+1 to m_prime.

Thus, both parts can be handled with the same grouping approach.

This would avoid the O(k) loop in part1, replacing it with O(sqrt(n)) steps.

So the code can be modified as follows:

Compute sum_part1:

sum_part1 = 0

q_min = floor(n/(k+1)) + 1 → no, wait.

Wait, for i in 1 to k, q = floor(n/i) can be as large as n (when i=1), but the minimal q is floor(n/k).

For example, when i=k, q = floor(n/k) = q0. So q ranges from q0 to n.

But how to iterate over all possible q's that are present in i=1 to k.

But this seems tricky.

Alternatively, we can compute all possible q's for i in 1 to k by iterating q from q_start to q_end, where q_start is 1 and q_end is floor(n/1) =n. But this is O(n) steps, which is impossible.

So perhaps the only way to compute sum_part1 efficiently is to use the same approach as sum_part2, but iterate over q in a certain range.

But how.

Alternatively, note that for i <=k, floor(n/i) >= floor(n/k) = q0. For example, k=3e6 for n=1e13, then q0=3e6.

But floor(n/i) for i=1 is 1e13, for i=2 is 5e12, etc. So the q's are large, but the number of possible q's for i<=k is O(k), which is still 3e6 steps.

So this approach may not help.

Thus, the original code's approach is not feasible for the largest test cases in Python.

So alternative idea: find that sum_part1 can be computed as the sum over q >=q0 (where q0 is floor(n/k)) of q * sum of i in I_q for i <=k.

But how to find these q's.

Alternatively, the sum_part1 can be written as sum_{i=1 to k} i * floor(n/i) = sum_{i=1 to k} (n - (n mod i)).

But this is sum_{i=1 to k} n - sum_{i=1 to k} (n mod i) = n*k - sum_{i=1 to k} (n mod i).

But sum_{i=1 to k} (n mod i) can be computed using the same approach as the original problem, but for m=k.

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternative plan:

Find that sum_part1 and sum_part2 can be computed using the same method. So the code can be modified to compute both parts in the same loop.

But how.

The code's original approach of splitting into part1 and part2 is necessary because for part1, i is up to k, and part2 handles larger i's. But for part1, the code uses a loop over i, which is slow.

So to optimize, perhaps compute part1 using the same group-based approach as part2.

So, for part1:

Compute all q's such that there exists an i in [1, k] where floor(n/i) = q.

For each such q:

L = floor(n/(q+1)) +1

R = floor(n/q)

Adjust L and R to be within 1 and k.

Sum q * sum of i from L to R.

But how to find all such q's.

This approach would allow us to compute part1 in O(sqrt(n)) steps.

But how to find the q's for part1.

Let's see:

For i in [1, k], floor(n/i) can be as large as n (i=1), and as small as floor(n/k).

So q ranges from q_max_part1 = floor(n/1) =n down to q_min_part1 = floor(n/k).

For each q in this range, compute L and R as floor(n/(q+1)) +1 and floor(n/q), then adjust to i <=k.

But iterating over all possible q's from q_min_part1 to q_max_part1 is O(n) steps, which is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is not helpful.

Alternative idea: note that part1 can be computed using the same group-based approach as part2, but only for i <=k.

So for part1, the code would iterate over q in the same way as part2, but the i's are restricted to 1 <=i <=k.

But how to find the q's for this.

Alternatively, the code can compute part1 and part2 in a single loop, handling all possible q's.

But this may not be possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the original code is the best we can do, but we need to optimize it for Python.

But how.

In Python, loops are slow. So the key is to reduce the number of iterations.

The original code for part1 has min(k, m_prime) iterations. For n=1e13, k=3e6. But in Python, even 3e6 iterations could take 0.3 seconds. But when m_prime is 3e6, the code would take 0.3 seconds for part1. Similarly, part2 would have 3e6 iterations, taking another 0.3 seconds. Total 0.6 seconds, which is acceptable.

But what if m_prime is 1e13, but that's possible only when m >=n and n=1e13. But m_prime is min(m, n), so if m >=n, m_prime is n=1e13. But k is sqrt(n) which is 1e6.5, but part1's loop is up to k, which is 3e6. So part1's loop is 3e6 steps. Which is manageable.

But when n=1e13, m=1e13, m_prime=1e13. part1's loop is up to k=3e6 steps. part2's loop is up to q_max=1e13/(3e6+1) ≈ 3e6. So part2's loop is 3e6 steps. So total steps 6e6. Python can handle this in under 2 seconds.

But perhaps in Python, each iteration is too slow. For example, in part2's loop, each iteration has multiple divisions and condition checks.

Alternative approach: precompute all possible q's and their ranges for part1 and part2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use mathematical formulas to compute sum_part1 and sum_part2.

But sum_part1 is sum_{i=1 to k} i * floor(n/i). There's no known closed-form formula for this sum.

Alternative idea: note that sum_part1 can be computed as sum_{i=1 to k} i * (n // i) = sum_{i=1 to k} i * q_i, where q_i = n//i.

But for i in 1 to k, q_i ranges from n//1 down to n//k.

But since n//i decreases as i increases, the q_i's are in a non-increasing sequence.

We can group consecutive i's where q_i is the same.

For example, find all intervals [a, b] where q_i = q for all i in [a, b]. Then sum for that group is q * (a + b) * (b -a +1)/2.

Thus, for part1, we can find all such groups and compute the sum in O(number of groups) steps.

The number of groups is O(2*sqrt(n)), which is manageable.

So how to compute these groups for i=1 to k.

Let's see:

q_prev = n//1 =n.

group starts at a=1.

Then find the largest i where n//i =q_prev.

This is the same as finding R = floor(n/q_prev).

But wait, for q_prev =n, floor(n/q_prev) =1.

So the group for q_prev=n is i=1.

Then next q_prev =n//2.

Wait, this seems similar to the part2 approach.

Thus, the code for part1 can be rewritten using group-based approach:

sum_part1 =0

i=1

k_min = min(k, m_prime)

while i <= k_min:

   q = n // i

   # Find the largest j where n//j ==q.

   # q = floor(n/i) implies j can be up to floor(n/q).

   # But i increases, so j must be >=i.

   # Also, j must be <=k_min.

   j = min( n // q, k_min )

   sum_i = q * (i +j) * (j -i +1) //2

   sum_part1 += sum_i

   i = j +1

This way, part1 is computed in O(number of groups) steps, which is O(2*sqrt(n)) steps.

For example, in sample 1: n=3, k=1.

i=1:

q=3//1=3.

j = min(3//3=1,1) =1.

sum_i=3*(1+1)*1//2=3*2*1//2=3.

i becomes 2, loop ends.

sum_part1=3.

This matches the sample.

Sample 2: n=4, k=2.

i=1:

q=4//1=4.

j= min(4//4=1, 2) →1.

sum_i=4*(1+1)*1//2=4*2*1//2=4.

i=2.

q=4//2=2.

j= min(4//2=2, 2) →2.

sum_i=2*(2+2)*1//2=2*4*1//2=4.

sum_part1=4+4=8.

Which matches.

Thus, the code for part1 can be rewritten using this group-based approach, which reduces the number of iterations from 3e6 to O(2*sqrt(n)) steps, which is much more efficient.

Similarly, part2 can be computed using the same group-based approach.

So the new code will compute both sum_part1 and sum_part2 using group-based approaches, reducing the total number of iterations to O(4*sqrt(n)), which is manageable.

Thus, the optimized code would be:

Compute sum_part1 using group-based approach for i=1 to k.

Compute sum_part2 using group-based approach for q=1 to q_max.

But wait, sum_part2's group-based approach is already using q.

Alternatively, sum_part2 can be computed as sum of q * sum of i in [L_adj, R_adj].

So the code for part2 remains as before.

But sum_part1's code is now optimized.

Thus, the code can be rewritten as:

import math

n, m = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 10**9 +7

m_prime = min(m, n)

if m_prime ==0:

   print(0)

   exit()

k = math.isqrt(n)

sum_part1 =0

i =1

upper_i = min(k, m_prime)

while i <= upper_i:

   q = n //i

   max_j = n // q

   max_j = min(max_j, upper_i)

   sum_i = q * (i + max_j) * (max_j -i +1) //2

   sum_part1 += sum_i

   i = max_j +1

sum_part1 %= MOD  # Not needed, but to prevent overflow.

sum_part2 =0

q_max = n // (k +1)

# For part2, iterate q from 1 to q_max.

q =1

while q <= q_max:

   L = (n // (q+1)) +1

   R = n // q

   L_adj = max(L, k+1)

   R_adj = min(R, m_prime)

   if L_adj > R_adj:

       q +=1

       continue

   # sum_i is (L_adj + R_adj) * (R_adj - L_adj +1) //2

   sum_i = (L_adj + R_adj) * (R_adj - L_adj +1) //2

   sum_part2 += q * sum_i

   q +=1

sum_part2 %= MOD

total_S = (sum_part1 + sum_part2) % MOD

result = ( (n * m - total_S) % MOD + MOD ) % MOD

print(result)

But in part2's code, the loop is still O(q_max) steps, which can be 3e6 steps. Which is too slow for Python.

Wait, but in part2's code, q is from 1 to q_max. But q_max is n//(k+1) = 1e13 // (3e6 +1) ≈ 3e6. So the loop is 3e6 steps, which is too slow in Python.

Thus, part2 also needs to be optimized using a group-based approach.

The group-based approach for part2:

For part2, the code is summing q * sum_i for i in [L_adj, R_adj], where L and R are functions of q.

But the code currently loops over each q from 1 to q_max. But this is O(q_max) steps.

But perhaps we can find ranges of q where L and R are the same or change in a predictable way.

Alternatively, we can group q's where the corresponding R_adj and L_adj form a contiguous range.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative idea: for part2, the code can compute the sum in a way similar to part1, by iterating over possible q's in groups where certain parameters are fixed.

But it's not clear how to do this.

Alternatively, notice that for part2, the i's are in [k+1, m_prime], and floor(n/i) = q. The q for these i's ranges from 1 to q_max = floor(n/(k+1)).

For each q, the i's are in [L, R] where L = floor(n/(q+1)) +1 and R = floor(n/q).

But when q decreases, L and R may increase.

But how to find all possible q's and their ranges.

Another approach: for part2, iterate over possible i's in [k+1, m_prime], but in groups where floor(n/i) is the same.

But how to find these groups.

For example, for i in [k+1, m_prime], the value of q = floor(n/i). For each possible q, find the range of i's that give this q.

But since i is >=k+1, q is <= floor(n/(k+1)) = q_max.

Thus, for part2, the code can iterate over possible q's from 1 to q_max, and for each q, compute the valid i's and their sum.

But this is what the code currently does.

So the code for part2 is already grouped by q. The number of q's is q_max, which is O(sqrt(n)).

But for n=1e13, q_max is 3e6. So 3e6 iterations in part2.

Which is manageable.

But in Python, a loop of 3e6 steps may take too long.

Alternative idea: precompute all possible q's and their ranges, and vectorize the operations.

But in Python, it's not possible to vectorize this loop.

Thus, perhaps the only way to proceed is to accept that the code will be accepted for the given time constraints, given that part1 is optimized using group-based approach.

Let's check the code with part1 optimized.

For n=1e13, part1's loop will have O(sqrt(n)) groups. For example, each group can have a range of i's where q is the same. The number of groups is O(2*sqrt(n)), which for n=1e13 is 2e6 groups. Each group is handled in O(1) steps. So part1's loop would have 2e6 steps.

Similarly, part2's loop would have 3e6 steps. But in Python, 5e6 steps with simple operations would take around 1 second.

But let's test the code.

Sample 1: n=3, m=4.

sum_part1:

i=1, q=3. max_j = min(3//3=1, 1) →1. sum_i=3*(1+1)*1//2=3. i=2.

Loop ends. sum_part1=3.

sum_part2: q_max=3//2=1.

q=1:

L=(3//2)+1=1+1=2.

R=3//1=3.

L_adj=2, R_adj=3.

sum_i= (2+3)*2//2=5.

sum_part2=5.

Thus, same as before.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, the code with part1 optimized using group-based approach and part2 using loop over q is correct.

Thus, the final code is as follows.
