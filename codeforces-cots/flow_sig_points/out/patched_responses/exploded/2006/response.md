Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to compute the double factorial of n modulo mod, where the input is given as a single integer which is 1000*n + mod. The constraints are that n and mod are between 1 and 999. But the input can be up to 999999, so n could be up to 999 and mod up to 999. 

First, I need to parse the input correctly. For example, if the input is 6100, then n is 6 (since 6100 / 1000 is 6.1, but integer division gives 6, and mod is 100). So, the way to split is input divided by 1000 gives n, and the remainder is mod. But since input is 1000*n + mod, the remainder when divided by 1000 is mod. Wait, no. Wait, the input is structured as 1000 * n + mod. So, for example, if input is 6100, that's 6*1000 + 100, so n is 6, mod is 100. So to get n and mod from the input, we can do n = input // 1000, mod = input % 1000. Oh right! Because input is 1000n + mod. So for example, 6100 divided by 1000 is 6, remainder 100. So that's how to split.

So first step: parse input into n and mod. Then compute the double factorial of n modulo mod.

Now, the double factorial. Let's recall that the double factorial of n, denoted n!!, is the product of all the integers from n down to 1 (or 2) that have the same parity as n. So if n is even, multiply even numbers down to 2. If n is odd, multiply odd numbers down to 1. 

So for example, 6!! is 6*4*2=48. 9!! is 9*7*5*3=945. 

The problem is to compute this product modulo mod. But n can be up to 999. Let's think about how big 999!! could be. For even n=999, it's the product of all even numbers down to 2. Wait no, 999 is odd. So 999!! is 999 * 997 * ... * 3 * 1. The number of terms here is (999 +1)/2 = 500 terms. So multiplying 500 numbers each around 1000. That's a huge number. Directly computing the product is impossible due to size. But since we need the product modulo mod, we can compute the product modulo mod as we go, which would keep the numbers manageable.

So the approach is to iterate through each term in the double factorial sequence, multiply them modulo mod, and take the result mod mod each step. That way, the intermediate product never exceeds mod * current term, but since mod can be up to 999, and current term up to 999, the intermediate product would be up to 999*999 = 998001. Which is manageable in Python even for 1000 iterations.

Wait, but n can be up to 999. So for even n, the number of terms is 999/2 = 499.5, but since it's integer division, 500 terms. For odd n, similar. So in the worst case, for n=999, we have 500 terms. So even for the maximum n, 500 multiplications. Which is trivial in terms of time. So the algorithm is O(n) time, which for n up to 999 is perfectly acceptable, even in Python.

So the plan is:

1. Parse input into n and mod.
2. Compute the double factorial of n mod mod.
3. Output the result.

But wait, there's a catch. What if mod is 0? But according to the problem statement, input mod 1000 is not zero. So mod is at least 1. So no division by zero issues.

But another thing to note: if at any point during the multiplication, the product becomes zero mod mod, then all subsequent multiplications will leave it as zero. So we can actually break early if the product becomes zero. Because once it's zero, multiplying by more terms won't change the result. That's an optimization that can save time for cases where mod is smaller than n. For example, if mod is 2 and n is 100. Then 100!! is even, so mod 2 is zero. So once we multiply 2 into the product, the product becomes zero mod 2, and all subsequent terms can be skipped. But even without this optimization, the code would handle 500 iterations, which is acceptable. So maybe adding this optimization is not necessary, but it's easy to do and can speed up some cases.

So the steps for computing the double factorial mod mod:

Initialize result as 1.

If n is even, start from 2, step by -2 each time until reaching 2. Wait, no: for even n, the terms are n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 2. For example, 6!! is 6*4*2. For n=6, terms start at 6 and subtract 2 each step. Similarly, for n=9 (odd), terms are 9,7,5,3,1.

So the loop starts at n, and subtracts 2 each step until it reaches 2 (if even) or 1 (if odd).

So for i in range(n, 0 if n is odd else 0, step=-2). Wait, in Python, perhaps a loop that starts at n and steps by -2, until we reach 1 (if odd) or 2 (if even). Alternatively, a while loop.

So the code would be something like:

product = 1

current = n

while current >= 1 if odd else 2:

    product = (product * current) % mod

    current -= 2

But in code terms, perhaps:

if n % 2 == 0:

    start = n

    step = -2

    end = 2

else:

    start = n

    step = -2

    end = 1

Then, iterate from start to end, step by step, multiplying each term.

Alternatively, a loop that starts at n and subtracts 2 each time until it's less than the end.

So in code:

current = n

product = 1

mod = ... 

while current >= 1:

    product = (product * current) % mod

    current -= 2

    if product == 0:

        break  # optimization

Wait, for even numbers, the loop stops when current is 0? Wait no. For example, even n=6: 6,4,2. So current starts at 6, then 4, then 2, then subtract 2 to 0. So the loop would run for 6,4,2. Because current >= 1: after 2, subtract 2 becomes 0, which is less than 1. So loop stops. So the code would correctly process all even terms.

Similarly, for odd n=9: 9,7,5,3,1. Then subtract 2 becomes -1, which is less than 1. So loop stops.

So yes, the loop condition can be current >= 1. Because for even numbers, the loop will stop when current becomes 0 after processing 2.

So the code can be written as:

product = 1

current = n

mod = ... 

while current >= 1:

    product = (product * current) % mod

    current -= 2

    if product == 0:

        break  # since further multiplications won't change the result

But even without the break, it's manageable. But adding the break can save some steps. For example, if mod is 2 and n is even, then product will be 0 after the first term. So adding the break would exit early.

So including this optimization is better.

So putting this all together:

First, parse input into n and mod.

Then compute the product as described.

But wait: what if mod is 1? Then any number mod 1 is 0. So in that case, the result is 0. So even if mod is 1, the code would compute the product mod 1, which is 0. So the code can handle that.

Another edge case: n=1. Then 1!! is 1 mod mod.

Now, let's test the sample inputs.

First sample input is 6100. So input is 6100. n=6100//1000=6, mod=6100%1000=100. So compute 6!! mod 100. 6!! is 6*4*2=48. 48 mod 100 is 48. Which matches the sample.

Second sample: input 9900. n=9, mod=900. 9!! is 9*7*5*3 = 945. 945 mod 900 is 45. Which matches.

Third sample: input 100002. 100002 divided by 1000 gives 100002 // 1000 is 100 (since 100*1000=100000, 100002-100000=2). So mod is 2. Compute 100!! mod 2. 100 is even, so the product is 100*98*96*...*2. All even numbers. So the product is even, so mod 2 is 0. Which matches.

Fourth sample: input 123456. 123456//1000 is 123, mod is 456. So compute 123!! mod 456. 123 is odd, so the product is 123*121*...*1. Then mod 456. The sample output is 171. So the code must compute that correctly.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code in Python:

Read the input as a single integer. Then split into n and mod.

Then compute the product as per the steps.

So the code:

Testing against sample input 3.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    input_num = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    n = input_num // 1000
    mod = input_num % 1000

    product = 1
    current = n
    while current >= 1:
        product = (product * current) % mod
        current -= 2
        if product == 0:
            break
    print(product % mod, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
123456
""",
            "output": \
"""\
171
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

So the code can be written as:

input_num = int(input())
n = input_num // 1000
mod = input_num % 1000

product = 1
current = n
while current >= 1:
    product = (product * current) % mod
    current -= 2
    if product == 0:
        break
print(product)

But wait, in the case where mod is 1, the product will be 0. So correct.

Yes, this should work.

So the code is straightforward, and optimized by taking mod at each step and breaking early when product is zero. For the worst case, like n=999 and mod=999, the code runs 500 steps, each with a multiplication and a mod. That's acceptable in Python for the time constraints (since even 1e6 operations are manageable in 1 second, 500 is trivial).

So this should handle all test cases efficiently.

```python
input_num = int(input())
n = input_num // 1000
mod = input_num % 1000

product = 1
current = n
while current >= 1:
    product = (product * current) % mod
    current -= 2
    if product == 0:
        break
print(product)
```
