<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of lights that are on at any given time. Each light toggles its state (on/off) periodically based on its a_i and b_i parameters. The initial state is given by the string s.

First, I need to understand how each light's state changes over time. Let's think about a single light. The initial state is s[i]. Then, the light toggles at times b_i, b_i + a_i, b_i + 2*a_i, and so on. So, for each time t, we can compute whether the light is on or off by counting the number of toggles up to time t. If the count is even, the state remains as initial; if odd, it's flipped.

The main challenge is to simulate all possible times efficiently and find the maximum number of lights that are on. But how do we do that without checking every possible time up to infinity?

Hmm. The constraints on a_i and b_i are small (each up to 5). So maybe there's a pattern that repeats after some maximum time, and we can simulate up to that time. Let's think: the maximum a_i is 5, and b_i is up to 5. The toggle times for a light are b_i, b_i + a_i, etc. The toggle intervals are periodic, but for each light, the sequence of toggles is at intervals of a_i. So for any two consecutive toggles, the time between them is a_i.

But for the state of the light, what's the pattern? The state flips each time it toggles. So the state at time t depends on whether the number of toggles up to t is even or odd. So, for each light, the state can be determined by the parity of the number of toggles up to time t.

Now, how to model this for all possible t. Since the problem is to find the maximum number of lights on at any time, including the initial state (t=0?), wait, no. The initial state is at time 0. The first toggle is at b_i. So for t < b_i, the light is in initial state. Then, each toggle after that flips the state.

Wait, initial state is given. Then, the first toggle is at b_i. So for example, if a light is initially on, then at time t = b_i, it toggles to off. Then at t = b_i + a_i, back to on, and so on.

So the state at time t is:

if t < b_i: same as initial.

else: the number of toggles is the floor((t - b_i)/a_i) + 1. Because the first toggle is at b_i, the next at b_i +a_i, etc. So for t >= b_i, the number of toggles is (t - b_i) // a_i + 1.

Wait, let's see. For example, t = b_i: (b_i - b_i)/a_i = 0 → 0 +1 =1 toggle. Correct. For t = b_i + a_i → (a_i)/a_i=1 → 1+1=2 toggles. That's right. So the number of toggles up to time t is k = floor( (t - b_i) / a_i ) +1, but only if t >= b_i. Otherwise, zero.

So, for each time t, for each light i, compute whether the number of toggles is even or odd, then determine the state.

So the problem reduces to checking for all possible times t (including t=0), the sum of all lights that are on at that time. Then find the maximum such sum.

But how do we model all possible t? Since the problem allows t to be up to any possible time, but checking up to a certain maximum time where the pattern repeats.

Wait, perhaps after a certain time, the state of all lights starts to cycle. Then, we can check up to that maximum time, and then no need to check beyond.

But how to find that maximum time. Let's think: each light's state is periodic. The period for a light's state is 2*a_i. Because after 2*a_i seconds, the number of toggles would be 2 (if a_i is the interval between toggles). So the parity (even/odd) of the number of toggles would repeat every 2*a_i steps. So the state of the light is periodic with period 2*a_i.

But since each light has a_i up to 5, the maximum possible period for any light is 2*5=10. So the least common multiple (LCM) of all possible periods (2*a_i) would be LCM of 2*1, 2*2, ..., 2*5. Let's calculate that.

The possible 2*a_i values are 2,4,6,8,10.

The LCM of these numbers is LCM(2,4,6,8,10). Let's compute:

Factors:

2: 2

4: 2²

6: 2*3

8: 2³

10: 2*5

So LCM is 2³ *3 *5 = 8*15=120. So the LCM is 120. So the entire system's state (combination of all lights) would repeat every 120 seconds. Therefore, after time 120, the pattern of states would repeat.

So to find the maximum number of lights on, we can simulate all times up to 120, and then find the maximum in that interval.

Wait, but even beyond 120, the maximum could be in the first cycle. So simulating up to 120 would capture all possible maximums.

So the approach would be:

- For each possible time t from 0 up to (let's say) 120, compute the number of lights on at that time.

- The maximum of all these is the answer.

But why 120? Because after that, the states cycle. So if there's a higher count in a cycle after 120, there must have been a time in 0-120 where that same count occurred.

Therefore, checking up to t=120 (inclusive) is sufficient.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute for each light i, for each time t in 0..120, whether it's on or off.

2. For each t in 0..120, sum the number of on lights.

3. The maximum sum is the answer.

But how do we compute the state for each light i at time t?

For each light i:

Initial state is s[i] (0 or 1).

Compute the number of toggles up to time t.

If t < b_i: no toggles. So state is initial.

Else: number of toggles k = floor( (t - b_i) / a_i ) + 1.

If k is even: initial state remains.

If k is odd: initial state is flipped.

So for example, if initial is 1 (on), and k is even: remains 1. If k is odd: 0.

So the state is s_initial ^ (k % 2), where ^ is XOR. Because if the number of toggles is even, the state is the same as initial. If odd, flipped.

So for each light i and time t, compute k:

if t < b_i: k =0.

else: k = (t - b_i) // a_i +1.

Then, state is s_initial ^ (k % 2).

So for each t in 0 to 120, calculate this for all n lights, sum the 1s, and track the maximum.

Now, let's think about the computational complexity. n is up to 100. For each t up to 120. So 100 * 121 = 12,100 operations. That's very manageable. Even in Python, this will run in well under the time limit.

So the plan is:

- Read the input: n, s, then n pairs of a_i and b_i.

- For each light i, store initial state (s_i), a_i, b_i.

- For each time t from 0 to 120 (inclusive), compute for each light i whether it's on.

- Sum the number of on lights at each t, keep track of the maximum.

Now, let's test this against the examples.

First example:

Input:

3

101

3 3

3 2

3 1

So initial states are 1, 0, 1.

For t=0:

Lights 1:1, 2:0, 3:1. Sum 3? But the sample output says the maximum is 2. Wait, but the sample input's output is 2. So perhaps the first example's maximum occurs at t=2. Let's see.

Wait, the first sample's explanation says the maximum is 2, e.g. at t=2.

So according to the initial state, the sum at t=0 is 1+0+1=2. Wait, but sample input's s is '101', so three lights. So the initial sum is 2. But according to the output, the maximum is 2. But sample output says 2, but the sample says the output is 2. So why isn't that the maximum?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, the sample input says in the first example, the output is 2, which is achieved at t=2. So according to the initial state (t=0) sum is 1+0+1=2. But maybe during some other time, the sum is higher. Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 2. Hmm. So perhaps the initial state is considered as time 0, and the sample's answer is 2, which is the same as the initial state. But the sample says that the maximum is 2. So perhaps the code's approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the first sample.

Sample Input 1:

3

101

3 3

3 2

3 1

So the three lights:

Light 1: initial state '1' (on). a_i=3, b_i=3. So first toggle at t=3.

Light 2: initial '0' (off). a_i=3, b_i=2. First toggle at t=2.

Light3: initial '1' (on). a_i=3, b_i=1. First toggle at t=1.

Let's compute their states at various times.

t=0: all initial. 1+0+1=2.

t=1: Light3 toggles once. So state is 0. Others: Light1 (t=1 <3, no toggle. state 1. Light2: t=1 <2, no toggle. state 0. Sum 1+0+0=1.

t=2: Light2's first toggle (t=2). Its state becomes 1. Light3: toggles again at t=1+3=4, so between t=1 and t=4, only one toggle. So at t=2, Light3 has had one toggle (t=1). So state is 0. Light1: t=2 <3, state 1. So sum 1 (light1) +1 (light2) +0 (light3) = 2. Which matches the sample's example.

So the maximum is 2. But according to the code's approach, the initial state is 2, and then maybe other times have 2. So the code would check all times up to 120 and find the maximum. So in the first sample, the code would return 2.

But according to the code's approach, the initial time (t=0) has sum 2, which is the maximum. So why does the sample's answer is 2? Because that's the maximum. So the code's approach would capture that. So what's the problem here?

Ah, perhaps the initial state is considered at time 0, which is included in the simulation. So for the first sample, the code would find that at t=0, the sum is 2, and at t=2, sum is 2. So the maximum is 2. So the code would output that. Which matches the sample. So everything works.

So the code's approach is correct.

Another example: the second sample input. All 4 lights are initially on. So the initial sum is 4, which is the maximum, so the code would return 4.

Third sample input:

6

011100

Initial states are 0,1,1,1,0,0.

The parameters are:

Each a_i and b_i are up to 5.

The output is 6. So at some time t, all 6 lights are on.

So according to the code's approach, when simulating t up to 120, it must find that time.

So the code's approach would work.

So the plan is solid.

Now, the code:

First, read n.

Then read the string s. Then, for each of the n lines, read a_i and b_i.

For each light i (0-based or 1-based?), the initial state is s[i], which is '0' or '1'.

Then, for each t from 0 to 120 inclusive:

sum = 0

for each light:

compute the number of toggles up to t.

if t < b_i: k=0.

else:

k = (t - b_i) // a_i + 1.

Then, if k is even: state is initial.

if k is odd: state is flipped.

So for each light, initial_state = int(s[i]).

current_state = initial_state ^ (k % 2).

sum += current_state.

keep track of the maximum sum.

Now, code-wise:

```

Sample3: at some t, all 6 lights are on. So code would find that t.

So the code is correct.

But wait, the third sample's input has a_i and b_i values, for example:

Sample3 input:

6

011100

5 3

5 5

2 4

3 5

4 2

1 5

So the initial states are 0,1,1,1,0,0.

For each light:

Let's check for each light at a certain t where they are all on.

But perhaps the code would find that for some t, all are on.

But in any case, the code's approach will check all t up to 120.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, about optimizing. Since the code runs in O(n * 121) steps, which is acceptable for n=100, it's 12,100 operations. That's very manageable. So no further optimizations are needed.

Therefore, this code should work correctly and efficiently.
