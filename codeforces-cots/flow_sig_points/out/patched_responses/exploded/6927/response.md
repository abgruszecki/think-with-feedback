Okay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of ways to color a 2xN grid such that there are exactly k connected components. And we have to do this modulo 998244353. Hmm.

So the grid has two rows and n columns. Each cell is either black or white. Neighbors are adjacent cells (sharing a border) of the same color. Components are formed by connected regions of the same color. We need to count all possible colorings where the total number of components is exactly k.

First, I need to model how the components form as we build the grid column by column. Since each column has two cells, perhaps the state transitions can be based on the current column's color configuration and how it connects to the previous column. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where the state captures the current pattern and the number of components.

Let's think about possible patterns for a column. Each column can be in one of several possible states. For example, both cells in the column are the same color, or different. Also, how the current column connects to the previous one affects the component count.

Wait, the possible column configurations are:

1. Both cells are black (state 0, maybe).
2. Both are white (state 1).
3. Top is black, bottom is white (state 2).
4. Top is white, bottom is black (state 3).

Wait, but state 2 and 3 might be considered the same in terms of structure, but perhaps not. Because the colors are different in the column, so the way they connect to the next column might vary. Hmm, but maybe some of these states can be grouped. Let's see.

Wait, for state 2 and 3, since the column has two different colors, these cells are not connected to each other. So, each forms their own component within the column. But when considering transitions between columns, the previous column's state and the current state will determine how components merge or split.

So maybe the state for the DP needs to represent the current column's pattern (like which of the four possible color combinations it is) and the number of components so far, but also how the current column connects to the previous. For example, if the previous column was in state 0 (both black), and the current column is also state 0, then the two columns are connected, so the component count might stay the same or change based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the state should track the previous column's pattern and the current number of components, as well as how the current column's pattern affects the component count. Because each step (each new column added) can affect the component count based on how it's connected to the previous column.

So, the idea is to model the DP based on the last column's pattern and the number of components. Let's denote the possible column patterns as types. For example, the possible types could be:

Type 0: both cells same color (like both black or both white). But wait, maybe we need to treat black and white as separate types. Wait, but since the colors are either black or white, but the exact color choice may multiply the possibilities. For example, if a column is type 0 (both same), there are two possibilities: black or white. Similarly, type 2 (different) has two possibilities as well (black-white or white-black). Wait, but perhaps the type can be categorized based on the arrangement, and then multiplied by the number of color choices that fit that arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the four possible column colorings are:

A: both cells in the column are the same color (e.g., top and bottom are both black or both white). There are two possibilities for this type (black or white). But perhaps in the DP state, we can represent this as a single type, but track the count considering the two possibilities. For example, when transitioning, if the current column is of type A, then each transition would multiply by 2 (since there are two color choices for this type).

Wait, but in that case, the transitions would have to account for whether the color of the current column's type A is the same as the previous column's type A. Because if the previous column was type A (say, black), and the current is type A (black again), then the two columns are merged. But if the current is type A (white), then they are not merged. So the color choice affects the transition. That complicates things.

Hmm, so perhaps the DP state should track not only the pattern of the current column but also the color(s) in that pattern, but that would lead to a lot of states. Alternatively, perhaps the state can represent the pattern type (like 0 for same color, 1 for different), but also the color of the same-type column. Wait, but maybe that's not necessary. Let's think differently.

Wait, for the same-type column (both same color), the color can be either black or white. For the purposes of component transitions between columns, the color of the same-type column is important. For example, if two consecutive columns are same-type, then if the color is the same, the component is connected, otherwise not. But maybe the DP can model the previous column's type and color (or perhaps the same-type column's color isn't necessary, but instead, the transitions can account for whether the color matches or not).

Alternatively, perhaps the DP state can be represented by the pattern of the previous column (type) and the number of components, and then for each possible transition to a new column type, we can calculate how the components change based on the previous and current type, as well as the color choices.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model the possible transitions between column types and see how the component count changes.

Let's first categorize the column patterns into two main types:

Type 0: Both cells in the column are the same color. This can be either black or white. So for each such column, there are two color options.

Type 1: The two cells are different colors. There are two possible configurations here: top is black and bottom white, or top white and bottom black. Again, two options.

So, the possible column types are 0 and 1. Each type has two possible color configurations, but for type 0, the two options are the same in terms of their effect on the component structure (since they are both same color), and for type 1, the two options are different but also symmetric in a way. So perhaps the transitions can be modeled based on the type, and when calculating the number of possibilities, multiply by the number of color choices for that type when applicable.

Now, the key is to model how adding a new column affects the number of components based on the previous column's type and the current column's type.

Let's think of building the grid from left to right, column by column. For each step, the state includes:

- The type of the previous column (0 or 1).

- The current number of components.

But wait, maybe the state needs to include more information. For example, when the previous column is type 0, the color (black or white) could influence whether the next column's type 0 (same color) connects to it. So, perhaps the DP state needs to track not just the type of the previous column, but also the color of the previous column if it's type 0. However, that might double the number of states. Alternatively, we can model the transitions considering whether the previous column's type 0 color is the same as the current column's type 0 color.

Wait, but perhaps for the same type (type 0), the color can be same or different. Let's think about transitions between columns of type 0.

Suppose the previous column was type 0 (say, color A). The current column is also type 0 (color B). Then:

- If B == A: the two columns are connected, so the number of components contributed by the current column is 0 (since it's part of the same component as the previous column's type 0). However, the previous column's component may have merged with the current's.

Wait, this might be tricky. Let's think in terms of adding a new column and how it affects the total component count.

When we add a new column, the components can be affected in two ways:

1. The new column's cells may connect to the previous column's cells, potentially merging existing components.

2. The new column's cells may form new components.

For example, consider the first column. If it's type 0 (same color), it contributes 1 component. If it's type 1 (different colors), it contributes 2 components.

Now, when adding the second column:

If the second column is type 0 (same color as first):

- If the color is same as first column's color, then the two columns are connected. So the total components for the first two columns would be 1 (since the two columns form a single component).

- If the color is different, then the second column is a separate component. So total components would be 1 (from first column) + 1 (from second) = 2.

Wait, but how? Let's see. The first column is type 0 (color A). The second is type 0 (color B). So each column's two cells are the same color.

If B == A: then the two columns are adjacent and same color, so their entire column is part of the same component. So total components would be 1.

If B != A: then the first column is a component (A), the second is a component (B). So two components.

But wait, the columns are adjacent. So if the previous column is type 0 (color A) and the current is type 0 (color B), then if B == A, the current column's cells are part of the same component as the previous. So adding this column doesn't increase the component count. But if B is different, then the current column adds a new component, increasing the count by 1.

But how does this affect the transitions in the DP?

Alternatively, the DP state can track the previous column's type and color. For example, if the previous column is type 0, the color could be A or B. But that's probably not feasible, as the color could vary. So perhaps the DP state should not track the actual color, but whether the current column's color (if type 0) is the same as the previous's type 0.

But how?

Wait, for type 0, the color can be 0 or 1 (arbitrary, but each choice gives two options). But when transitioning between two type 0 columns, the color choice can be same or different. For each such transition, the number of color options is 1 (if same) or 1 (if different), but multiplied by the possibilities. Wait, no. If previous column is type 0 with color A (could be black or white, but in the state, perhaps we don't track which, but just whether the current column's color is same as previous).

Alternatively, perhaps when the previous column is type 0, the color can be considered as "some color", and when the current column is type 0, the color can be same or different. Then, for each transition, the number of possibilities is 1 (same) or 1 (different), but since there are two possible colors for type 0, the total possibilities for choosing same or different would depend on the previous's color. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for type 0, the color is not tracked, but the transitions account for whether the color of the current column's type 0 is same as the previous's type 0. So, for example, when the previous column is type 0 and the current is type 0, there are two possibilities: same color (1 way) or different color (1 way). But in reality, for a previous type 0 column, there are two possible colors. If the current column is type 0 and same color, then there's 1 option (same as previous), but if previous color was A, current can be A again (so 1 way per previous state). But this seems difficult to model.

Hmm. Maybe this approach is not the way to go. Let's think of the state as including the previous column's type and the color (if it's type 0), but since this could lead to too many states, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, let's model the DP state as follows:

dp[i][c][prev_type][prev_color_same], where i is the column index, c is the current number of components, prev_type is the type of the previous column (0 or 1), and prev_color_same is a boolean indicating whether the current column's type 0 is the same color as the previous's type 0. But this seems too complex.

Wait, perhaps the key is to notice that for type 0 columns, when they are consecutive, the choice of color (same as previous or different) affects the component count. So for the transitions between consecutive type 0 columns:

If the current type is 0 and same color as previous type 0, then the current column's cells are merged into the previous column's component, so no new component is added.

If the current type is 0 and different color from previous, then the current column forms a new component, adding 1 component.

But how do we model this in the DP?

Alternatively, perhaps the state can track the previous column's type and the way it connects to the current column. Let's think of possible transitions between different column types and how they affect the component count.

Let me try to list all possible transitions between previous type and current type, and see how the component count changes.

Case 1: Previous column is type 0 (same color), current column is type 0.

Subcases:

a) Current column's color is same as previous.

Then, the current column's two cells are connected to the previous column's cells (since same color and adjacent). So, the two columns' cells form a single component. The addition of this column doesn't create any new components, but since the previous columns may have been connected, the total components may not change.

Wait, for example, if the previous state had a component count of c, adding a new type 0 column with same color would not increase the component count. So the new component count remains c + 0 (since the current column's cells are part of the previous component).

Wait, but that's only true if the previous column's type 0 was part of a single component. For example, if the previous state ends with a type 0 column, then the current column (same color) will merge into that component, so no new components are added.

But how does this affect the overall count?

Hmm. Let's model the state as follows:

The state includes the previous column's type, and the number of components up to that column. Also, for type 0 columns, perhaps the state needs to track whether the previous column's color is the same as the current's, but that seems difficult.

Alternatively, for each transition between two columns, we can precompute how the component count changes based on the previous type and the current type, along with the color choices.

Let's consider each possible transition:

Previous type: 0 (same color) or 1 (different color).

Current type: 0 or 1.

So, there are 4 possible transitions.

For each transition, we need to calculate the change in component count (delta) when adding the current column. Also, the number of color options for the current column depends on its type and the previous transition.

Let's break it down.

First, when the previous column is type 0 (same color):

Current column type 0:

Case 1: same color as previous.

In this case, the current column is connected to the previous. The current column's cells are part of the same component as the previous. So the delta (change in components) is 0. The current column adds 0 new components.

But the previous component is extended into this column, so the total remains the same.

Case 2: different color from previous.

The current column's cells form a new component. So delta is +1. So the total components increase by 1.

But how many color options are there here? For previous type 0, the color could be any (black or white). For current type 0, if we choose a different color, there's 1 option (since previous is fixed). So for each previous type 0, when current is type 0 and different color, there's 1 option. So for this transition, the number of color options is 1 (same as previous) and 1 (different), but perhaps the DP needs to track whether the color is same or different.

Wait, but the DP needs to model the state in such a way that when a new column is added, the transitions consider the color choices. However, tracking the color directly could lead to state explosion.

Alternatively, perhaps for transitions involving type 0 columns, the delta in components can be calculated based on whether the color is same or different, and the number of color choices for each case.

For example, when the previous column is type 0 and current is type 0:

- If the color is same, delta is 0. The number of color choices is 1 (same as previous).

- If the color is different, delta is +1. The number of color choices is 1 (different from previous).

But since the previous column's type 0 could be any color, but for the transition, the color choice is determined by the current's choice. So when we transition from a previous type 0, the color of the current type 0 is either same (1 way) or different (1 way).

But how does this multiply into the DP transitions?

Hmm, perhaps the DP state for the previous column's type and the color (same or different) when transitioning. But maybe it's better to model transitions where the previous column's type is known, and for the current column's type, along with whether the color is same as previous (if applicable), and compute the delta and the number of possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions can be modeled as follows:

For each possible previous state (type, and possibly color-related info), and for each possible current type, compute the delta in components and the number of color choices that would lead to that delta.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of all possible transitions.

Let me list all possible transitions and their effects.

Case 1: Previous column is type 0.

Current column is type 0:

Subcases:

a) Same color as previous.

- The new column is connected to the previous. So no new components added. The delta is 0.

- Number of color choices: 1 (same as previous).

b) Different color from previous.

- The new column is a new component. So delta is +1.

- Number of color choices: 1 (since previous is fixed, and current is different).

Current column is type 1:

In this case, the current column's two cells are different colors. So, each cell is part of their own component. But how do they connect to the previous column's cells?

The previous column's type 0 cells are the same color (say color A). The current column's cells are different (say top is B, bottom is C, with B != C).

So the top cell of current column can connect to the previous column's top cell (if color B == A). Similarly for the bottom cell.

So, for the current column being type 1 (two different colors), the two cells are not connected to each other. Each cell can connect to the previous column's cell if they are same color.

So, let's see:

The current column's top cell is B (could be same or different from previous's color A).

The bottom cell is C (different from B).

So, for example, if B == A and C != A:

- Top cell connects to previous column's component (since same color and adjacent). The bottom cell is part of a new component (since it's a different color from previous and current's top).

So, the new components added would be: the bottom cell of current column (1 component). The top cell is merged into the previous's component. So delta is +1.

But how does this affect the total components?

Wait, the previous state had c components. Adding this current column would contribute:

- The top cell is merged into the previous's component (so no change here).

- The bottom cell is a new component (since it's different from previous's color and not connected to the top cell).

So delta is +1.

But in this case, the number of color choices is 2? Let's see.

The previous column is type 0 (color A). The current column is type 1. For the top cell to be same as A (B = A), the bottom cell can be any color different from B, so there's 1 possibility (since B is fixed as A, the bottom can be white if A is black, etc.). But since type 1 has two possible colorings (top black and bottom white, or vice versa), perhaps the number of options here is 2.

Wait, for type 1, the two possible color configurations are top black, bottom white, and top white, bottom black. So, when the previous column is type 0 (color A), the current column's type 1 can have:

If A is black:

- top is black (same as A), bottom white (different). This is one option.

- top is white (different from A), bottom black (same as A). This is another option.

So, there are two possible color choices for the current column's type 1 where exactly one of the cells matches the previous column's color.

Alternatively, if the previous column's color is white:

Similar reasoning.

So, when previous column is type 0 (color A), and current column is type 1, then there are two possible color choices where exactly one cell matches A.

In these cases, how do the components change?

In such cases:

The cell that matches the previous's color (A) is connected to the previous column's component, so that cell is part of the same component. The other cell (different color) forms a new component. So, delta is +1.

But then, the total components increase by 1.

Alternatively, if both cells in current column's type 1 are different from previous's color A.

Wait, but type 1 requires that the two cells are different. So, for example, if previous is type 0 (color A), current is type 1 with top color B != A and bottom color C != A. But since B != C, this is possible.

But how would that affect the components?

In this case, the current column's top and bottom cells are not connected (since different colors). And since they are different from the previous column's color (A), they don't connect to the previous column. So each forms a new component. So delta is +2.

But for this case, the color choices would be:

Current column's top and bottom are different, and both different from previous's color A.

For example, if previous is black (A=black), then current could be white top and black bottom (but then bottom is same as previous, so C = black. Wait, no. If previous is black, current type 1 can be top white, bottom black (then bottom is same as previous's color), but that would connect to the previous's component. So that case was covered earlier. Alternatively, if current column's type 1 has both colors different from A: for example, previous is black, current top is white, bottom is red. Wait, no, the problem says each cell is black or white. So current column's type 1 is two different colors (B and C) which are each black or white. So if previous is black (A=black), then current column's type 1 can be:

top white, bottom black: bottom same as A. So one cell same, one different.

or top black, bottom white: top same as A.

Alternatively, there are two options where one cell is same as A and the other different.

But if both are different, that's not possible. Because for type 1, the two cells are different, so if previous is black, current type 1 must be white/black or black/white. Both of which have one cell same as previous's color (if the previous is black, then in the first case, bottom is black, same as previous. In the second case, top is black. So in both cases, exactly one cell is same as previous. So there are no type 1 options where both cells are different from previous's color A (if A is black). Because type 1 requires that the two cells are different, but the colors can't be both different from A if the previous is black and the current is type 1. Because, for example, if previous is black, current type 1 has two colors: one black and one white. So exactly one cell is same as previous's color.

Wait, that's right. Because type 1 is two different colors. So current column's type 1 has exactly one black and one white cell. So if previous column is type 0 (color A is black), then the current type 1 can have either:

top black (same as A), bottom white (different).

Or top white (different), bottom black (same as A).

So in both cases, exactly one cell matches the previous's color.

Thus, when the previous column is type 0 (color A) and the current is type 1, the current column's two cells have exactly one cell matching A. Therefore, each cell in the current column that matches A is connected to the previous's component. The other cell forms a new component.

But since the two cells in the current column are different, they are not connected to each other. So:

For current column type 1, when previous column is type 0 (color A):

- The cell that matches A is connected to the previous's component. The other cell is a new component.

So the delta is +1 (one new component added).

So in this case, the delta is +1, and the number of color options for this transition is 2.

Wait, because for each type 1 column, there are two possible color configurations (like black/white or white/black), but in this case, the two options correspond to which cell matches the previous's color. So for each previous type 0 (color A), there are two possible color choices for the current type 1 that have exactly one cell matching A. So the number of options here is 2.

So when the previous is type 0 and current is type 1:

delta is +1, and the number of color options is 2.

Now, the other possibility is when the current column is type 1 and both cells are different from previous's color. But as we saw, this is impossible because type 1 requires two different colors, and if previous is type 0 (color A), then current type 1 must have one cell same as A and the other different.

Thus, in this case, the delta is +1 and there are 2 color options.

Now, moving to the next case where previous column is type 0 and current column is type 0:

As before, if the current column's color is same as previous (case a), delta is 0. If different (case b), delta is +1. And the number of color options for case a is 1, case b is 1.

So, when transitioning from type 0 to type 0:

- same color: delta 0, 1 option.

- different color: delta +1, 1 option.

So the total options for this transition is 2 (since for type 0 columns, there are two possible colors, but the transition depends on whether they are same as previous or not).

Wait, but for type 0, each column has two possible colors. So when previous is type 0 (color A), the current type 0 column can be either same color (A) or different (not A). So two options. So for this transition, there are two possibilities: same color (1 option) or different (1 option), but each contributes a different delta.

So, the number of possibilities for this transition is 2 (same and different). But for the same color, the delta is 0, and for different color, delta is +1.

So when previous is type 0 and current is type 0, there are two possible transitions: same (delta 0) with 1 option, different (delta +1) with 1 option. So total 2 options for this transition.

Now, let's consider the case where previous column is type 0 and current column is type 1.

As discussed, delta is +1, and 2 options.

Now, what about previous column is type 0 and current column is type 0:

Wait, what's the delta in that case. For example, previous column is type 0 (color A), current is type 0 (color B):

If B == A, then the current column is merged into the previous's component. So the total components increase by 0.

If B != A, then the current column is a new component. So delta is +1.

Thus, for the transition from type 0 to type 0, the delta depends on whether the color is same or not.

Now, let's consider another case where previous column is type 1, current column is type 0.

Previous column is type 1: two cells are different colors. So the previous column contributes two components (each cell is a separate component, since they are different colors and not connected).

Now, current column is type 0 (same color). Let's say the color is C.

The previous column's top and bottom cells are different colors (say, D and E, where D != E). The current column's two cells are color C.

So, the current column's top cell (C) can connect to the previous's top cell (D) if C == D. Similarly, the current's bottom cell (C) can connect to the previous's bottom cell (E) if C == E.

But since the previous's top and bottom are different (D != E), C can be equal to D or E, but not both (unless D=E, which they are not).

So, for example:

If C == D:

Then, the current's top cell connects to the previous's top component, but the current's bottom cell (C) may not connect to the previous's bottom cell (E) since E != D and C = D != E.

So the current's column is connected to the previous's top component, and the current's bottom cell forms a new component (if C is same as previous's top). But since current column is type 0 (same color), the top and bottom cells are connected. So the entire current column is a single component, connected to the previous's top component. The previous's bottom component remains as is. So the delta is:

Previous components: let's say the previous columns had c components. Now, adding the current column:

- The current column's component is connected to the previous's top component, so merging into that.

- The previous's bottom component remains.

But wait, the previous's column's bottom component (from the bottom cell of previous column) was part of the overall components. So adding the current column's type 0 (C=D) would merge the current column into the previous's top component, and the current's bottom cell is part of the same component as the current's top. So the previous's bottom component is separate.

Thus, the delta would be: the current column's two cells form a single component connected to the previous's top component. The previous's bottom component remains. So the total components after adding current column is (c - 1) + 1 (current component merged with top) + 0 (current's bottom is merged with current's top). So the delta is (c - 1) + 1 = c. So the delta is (c_new) - (c_prev) = (c_prev -1 + 1) - c_prev = 0. So delta is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's imagine that before adding the current column, the previous state has c components. After adding the current column, how many components are there?

Suppose previous state has c components. The previous column is type 1 (two cells, each in their own component). So, for example, the previous column contributes two components. But the previous columns before that may have merged some of them.

But when adding the current column (type 0, color C):

If C == D (previous's top color), then the current column's top and bottom are connected (same color). The current's top cell is connected to previous's top cell (same color), so the current column is part of the previous's top component. The previous's bottom component remains as is.

But how does this affect the total components? Well, the current column adds no new components (since it's merged into the top component), but the bottom component of the previous column remains. So the total components would be c (previous components) - 1 (the top component is merged with current column) + 1 (current column is merged into top component) → no change? Or perhaps:

Wait, let's say the previous column's top and bottom components are part of separate components. For example, the previous state has components X (which includes the top cell of the previous column) and Y (which includes the bottom cell). Then, adding the current column (type 0, color C = D):

- The current column's top cell connects to X (since same color D).

- The current column's bottom cell is same color D, which is connected to the current's top cell. So the entire current column is part of component X.

So X is now extended into the current column. Y remains as is.

Thus, the total components after adding current column is X and Y → same as before. So delta is 0.

But wait, the previous state's component count is c. The current column adds 1 component (since type 0 is one component) but merged with X, so no new components. So delta is 0.

So, for this case, delta is 0. The number of color options here is 1 (C must be equal to D).

But the current column is type 0, which has two possible color options. But here, the color must match the previous's top or bottom. Or wait, in the previous column's type 1, the two cells are different. So previous's top is color D, bottom is color E, and D != E. So, when current column is type 0 (color C), C can be D or E. So two options.

If C = D:

- Current column's top and bottom are D.

- Current top cell is connected to previous's top (D), so current's entire column is merged into X.

- previous's bottom component Y remains.

- So components remain the same. Delta is 0.

If C = E:

- Current's top cell is E, same as previous's bottom (E).

- So current's bottom cell is E, connected to previous's bottom (E). So current's entire column is merged into Y.

- previous's top component X remains.

- So components again remain same. Delta is 0.

Thus, when previous column is type 1 and current is type 0, and the current's color is either D or E (previous's two colors), delta is 0. So delta is 0 in both cases, and the number of color options is 2 (since current type 0 can be colored as D or E, each of which is one option).

So, for the transition from type 1 to type 0:

delta is 0, and number of options is 2.

Another possibility: current column's color is neither D nor E (previous's colors). But since the previous column is type 1 (colors D and E, which are different), and current column's type 0 color is C. But C must be either D or E for the transition to have some effect. Wait, no. If C is a new color, but colors are either black or white, then D and E must be black and white (since type 1 is two different colors). So previous column's type 1 has D and E as black and white. So current column's type 0 color must be either black or white. So if current's color is black, then it matches either D or E (depending on previous's type 1's colors). But since in type 1, D and E are black and white (or white and black), then current's color can be either black or white. So for transition from type 1 to type 0, the current's color is either black or white (two options), and in both cases, delta is 0.

So for this transition, the delta is 0, and number of options is 2.

Now, what if the previous column is type 1 and current is type 1.

Previous column's type 1 has two cells of different colors (D and E).

Current column's type 1 has two cells of different colors (F and G, F != G).

So, the current's top cell can connect to previous's top (if F == D), and the current's bottom cell can connect to previous's bottom (if G == E).

Each such connection would merge components.

So, the delta depends on how many connections are made.

For example:

Case a: F == D and G == E.

Then, the current's top cell is connected to previous's top (same color D), and current's bottom is connected to previous's bottom (same color E). Also, current's top and bottom are different colors (F != G). So, current's top is part of previous's top component, current's bottom is part of previous's bottom component. So, the current column adds no new components, but may merge the two previous components.

Wait, no. Previous's top and bottom are part of different components (since in previous column, they are different colors). So, in previous's state, there are two separate components for the previous column. If the current column's top is connected to previous's top, and the current's bottom is connected to previous's bottom, then the current column's two cells are in different components (top connected to previous's top component, bottom connected to previous's bottom component). So the current column's cells are not connected to each other (different colors), so they remain in their respective components. Thus, the total components remain the same. So delta is 0.

But the number of options for this case: current's type 1 can be same as previous's type 1 (F=D, G=E) or reversed (F=E, G=D).

Wait, the previous column's type 1 has D and E (different). The current column's type 1 can have colors in two possible configurations:

Option 1: F = D, G = E. This is same as previous's type 1.

Option 2: F = E, G = D. This is the reversed configuration.

In option 1, the current's top connects to previous's top (same D), and current's bottom connects to previous's bottom (same E). So delta is 0.

In option 2, current's top is E (previous's bottom color), connects to previous's bottom. Current's bottom is D (previous's top color), connects to previous's top. So the current's top is part of the previous's bottom component, and current's bottom is part of previous's top component. So the two components (previous's top and bottom) are now connected via the current column? No, because the current's top and bottom are different colors and thus not connected. So the two components remain separate.

So in both cases, the delta is 0. The number of options for this transition is 2.

Case b: F == D, G != E.

Then, current's top is connected to previous's top, but current's bottom is not connected to previous's bottom. Also, current's bottom cell (G) is different from current's top (D), so it's a new component. So delta is +1.

But wait, current's bottom cell (G) is different from previous's bottom (E), so it's a new component.

So the current column's top is part of previous's top component, and current's bottom is a new component. So delta is +1.

Similarly, if F != D and G == E, then current's bottom is connected to previous's bottom, and current's top is a new component. Delta is +1.

Case c: F != D and G != E.

Then, current's top is a new component (not connected to previous's top), and current's bottom is a new component (not connected to previous's bottom). Also, since current's top and bottom are different colors, they are separate. So delta is +2.

So for transition from type 1 to type 1, there are several cases based on how many of the current's cells match the previous's cells.

But how many color options are there for each case?

The current column's type 1 has two possible color configurations. But the previous's type 1 has two colors D and E (different). So for current's type 1:

If F and G are D and E (same as previous), then two options (F=D, G=E or F=E, G=D). So case a: 2 options.

If F and G are D and something else (but since colors are only D and E?), no, wait, colors are only black and white. So previous's D and E are black and white. So current's F and G can be black and white or white and black.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify:

Previous column is type 1: two colors, say, black and white (D=black, E=white). Then, current column's type 1 can be:

- same as previous: black and white (F=black, G=white) → case a.

- reversed: white and black (F=white, G=black) → case a.

So for case a, there are two options.

For case b, where F == D (black) but G != E (white) → but G must be white (since type 1 requires F and G are different). So this is not possible. Wait, no. If previous's D is black and E is white, and current's F is black, then G must be white (type 1 requires F and G are different). So F == D (black) and G == white (E). So this is case a. So no, in this scenario, case b is not possible. Similarly, if F != D (F is white), then G must be black. So G == E (white) would not hold. So case c where F != D and G != E is only possible if current's F and G are white and black, but that would match previous's E and D. Which is case a.

Hmm, this suggests that for transition from type 1 to type 1, there are only two possible options: same as previous or reversed, and in both cases, delta is 0. So for this transition, delta is 0, and number of options is 2.

But wait, that can't be right. For example, suppose previous column is type 1 (black top, white bottom). Current column is type 1 (white top, black bottom). Then:

- Current's top (white) is connected to previous's top (black) → no.

- Current's bottom (black) is connected to previous's bottom (white) → no.

So current's two cells are not connected to previous's. So each of the current's cells forms a new component. So delta is +2. But according to the previous reasoning, that's not possible.

Ah, I see my mistake. The previous column's type 1 has two cells, D and E (different). The current column's type 1 can have colors F and G (different). So F and G can be D and E, or E and D, or other combinations.

But if D and E are black and white (previous's colors), then F and G can be:

Case 1: black and white → same as previous → delta 0.

Case 2: white and black → reversed → in this case, the current's top (white) is connected to previous's bottom (white) → yes. Because previous's bottom is white, current's top is white. So the current's top is connected to previous's bottom (adjacent, same color). So in this case, the current's top is merged into the previous's bottom component, and current's bottom (black) is connected to previous's top (black) → merged into previous's top component. So the two previous components (top and bottom) are now connected via the current column's top and bottom cells? Wait, no. Because the current column's top is connected to previous's bottom (white), and current's bottom is connected to previous's top (black). So the previous's top and bottom components are now connected through the current column's top and bottom cells. But wait, the current's top and bottom are different colors (white and black), so they are not connected to each other. So the previous's top component (black) is merged with the current's bottom (black) → forming a larger component. The previous's bottom component (white) is merged with current's top (white). So the two components are still separate. Thus, the delta is 0.

So, in this case, the current column's type 1 (reversed colors) has two connections: current's top to previous's bottom, and current's bottom to previous's top. But since the current's top and bottom are different, the two components (previous's top and bottom) are now connected through the current column's cells. Wait, no. Because the current's top and bottom are in different colors, so they are not connected. So the previous's top component (connected to current's bottom) and previous's bottom component (connected to current's top) remain separate. So the delta is 0.

Thus, for transition type 1 to type 1, there are two options (same or reversed), and both cases result in delta 0, with 2 options.

But wait, this can't be right. Let's take an example where previous column is type 1 (black and white), current column is type 1 (white and black). The previous column's components are two: the top cell (black) and bottom cell (white). Now, the current column's top is white, connected to previous's bottom (white) → merged into previous's bottom component. Current's bottom is black, connected to previous's top (black) → merged into previous's top component. So the current column's two cells are part of previous's components. So the total components remain 2. So delta is 0.

Thus, for transition from type 1 to type 1, delta is 0, and there are two color options.

So, in all cases, when transitioning from type 1 to type 1, delta is 0 and options are 2.

But wait, what if the current column's type 1 has colors that are both different from the previous's type 1? For example, previous is type 1 (black and white), current is type 1 (white and black). But in this case, the colors are the same as the previous's, just swapped. So it's still covered by the two options.

Thus, for all transitions from type 1 to type 1, delta is 0, options are 2.

Now, the last possibility: previous column is type 1 and current column is type 0 (same color).

We covered this earlier. For example, previous is type 1 (D and E), current is type 0 (C). The color C can be D or E. So two options. In each case, the current column's two cells (same color) are connected to one of the previous's components (D or E). The other component remains. So delta is 0.

Thus, the transitions from type 1 to type 0 have delta 0 and 2 options.

So, putting all possible transitions together:

Previous type | Current type | Delta | Number of options
---|---|---|---
0 | 0 | 0 (same color) | 1
0 | 0 | +1 (diff color) | 1
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
0 | 1 | +1 | 2
Wait, no. Let me re-express the transitions correctly:

For each transition from previous type to current type, the possible delta and options are as follows:

Transition from type 0 to type 0:

- Same color: delta 0, options 1.

- Different color: delta +1, options 1.

So total options for this transition: 2.

Transition from type 0 to type 1:

Delta +1, options 2.

Transition from type 1 to type 0:

Delta 0, options 2.

Transition from type 1 to type 1:

Delta 0, options 2.

So for each transition, the delta depends on the types and the color choices.

Now, the DP state can be modeled as follows:

dp[i][c][prev_type] = number of ways to color the first i columns, ending with type prev_type, with c total components.

But since for each transition, the delta depends on the previous type and current type and the color choices, we need to model the transitions in such a way that for each state (i, c, prev_type), we can transition to (i+1, c + delta, current_type) by considering all possible transitions and their options.

So the DP state is:

dp[i][c][t], where i is the number of columns processed so far, c is the current component count, and t is the type of the last column (0 or 1).

For the base case, the first column:

If it's type 0, it contributes 1 component. The number of ways is 2 (since two color choices).

If it's type 1, it contributes 2 components. The number of ways is 2 (two color choices).

So, for i=1:

dp[1][1][0] = 2.

dp[1][2][1] = 2.

Then, for each i from 2 to n:

For each possible previous component count c_prev, and each previous type t_prev:

For each possible current type t_curr:

For each possible transition from t_prev to t_curr:

Compute delta and the number of options (options).

Then, add to dp[i][c_prev + delta][t_curr] the value dp[i-1][c_prev][t_prev] * options.

But how to model the transitions between different types and the delta they contribute.

So, for each possible previous state (c_prev, t_prev), and for each possible current type t_curr, compute delta and the number of options.

The possible transitions are:

For t_prev = 0:

- t_curr = 0:

   a) same color: delta 0, options 1.

   b) different color: delta +1, options 1.

   So total options for this transition: 2. But each case contributes to different delta.

   So, for each possible transition from t_prev=0 to t_curr=0, the delta can be 0 or +1, each with 1 option.

   So, for each case, we need to split into two possibilities:

   dp[i][c_prev + 0][0] += dp[i-1][c_prev][0] * 1 (same color).

   dp[i][c_prev +1][0] += dp[i-1][c_prev][0] * 1 (different color).

- t_curr = 1:

   delta is +1, options 2.

   So:

   dp[i][c_prev +1][1] += dp[i-1][c_prev][0] * 2.

For t_prev = 1:

- t_curr = 0:

   delta 0, options 2.

   So:

   dp[i][c_prev +0][0] += dp[i-1][c_prev][1] * 2.

- t_curr = 1:

   delta 0, options 2.

   So:

   dp[i][c_prev +0][1] += dp[i-1][c_prev][1] * 2.

Thus, the transitions are:

From t_prev=0:

   to t_curr=0, delta 0: 1 option.

   to t_curr=0, delta +1: 1 option.

   to t_curr=1, delta +1: 2 options.

From t_prev=1:

   to t_curr=0, delta 0: 2 options.

   to t_curr=1, delta 0: 2 options.

This covers all possible transitions.

So, the DP can be implemented with these transitions.

Now, the maximum possible k is up to 2n (since each column can contribute up to 2 components, but depends on the transitions). So for n=1000, k can be up to 2000. Thus, the DP's component count dimension needs to handle up to 2000.

The DP will have states for i (up to 1000), c (up to 2000), and t (0 or 1).

The time complexity is O(n * k) per transition, but with the transitions being manageable.

But given that n is up to 1000 and k up to 2000, and for each i, we need to process all possible c_prev and t_prev, then the total number of operations would be O(n * k * 2) * 3 (number of transitions per prev state). For n=1000 and k=2000, this is 1000 * 2000 * 2 * 3 = 12,000,000 operations. Which should be manageable within 2 seconds.

Now, the next step is to model this DP in code.

We can represent the DP using two arrays: current and previous, to save space.

The initial state for i=1:

prev_dp[c][t] where c is 1 and t=0: 2 ways.

c is 2 and t=1: 2 ways.

For each i from 2 to n:

   current_dp is initialized to zero.

   For each c_prev in prev_dp's keys:

       for t_prev in 0, 1:

           if prev_dp[c_prev][t_prev] is zero, skip.

           process transitions for t_prev.

   For example:

   For t_prev=0:

       transitions to t_curr=0:

           delta 0: current_c = c_prev + 0 → current_c = c_prev.

           add to current_dp[current_c][0] += prev_dp[c_prev][0] * 1.

           delta +1: current_c = c_prev +1.

           add to current_dp[current_c][0] += prev_dp[c_prev][0] * 1.

       transition to t_curr=1:

           current_c = c_prev +1.

           add to current_dp[current_c][1] += prev_dp[c_prev][0] * 2.

   For t_prev=1:

       transitions to t_curr=0:

           current_c = c_prev + 0 → same.

           add to current_dp[current_c][0] += prev_dp[c_prev][1] * 2.

       transitions to t_curr=1:

           current_c = c_prev +0 → same.

           add to current_dp[current_c][1] += prev_dp[c_prev][1] * 2.

But handling this for all possible c_prev up to 2i (max 2n) is computationally feasible.

But implementing this with dictionaries or arrays?

To manage memory and speed, using arrays for each DP state would be better. Since k can be up to 2000 for n=1000, we can use two arrays for the previous and current state, with dimensions [k_max+1][2].

But for n=1000, the maximum possible components is 2n=2000. So for each i, c can range up to 2i.

So the arrays need to be size 2001 (since k can be up to 2000) for c.

Thus, the code can use two 2D arrays: previous_dp and current_dp, each of size (2001) x 2.

But in Python, for n=1000 and k=2000, this is manageable.

But in practice, for each i, the maximum possible c is 2i, which for i=1000 is 2000. So the arrays can be initialized with size (2001) x 2 for each step.

The code steps:

Initialize MOD = 998244353.

Read n and k.

If n is 0, handle edge case (but n >=1 according to constraints).

Initialize previous_dp as a 2D array with zeros.

For the first column (i=1):

   previous_dp[1][0] = 2 (type 0 contributes 1 component, 2 ways).

   previous_dp[2][1] = 2 (type 1 contributes 2 components, 2 ways).

For each i from 2 to n:

   Initialize current_dp to all zeros.

   For each c_prev in 0 to 2*(i-1):

       for t_prev in 0, 1:

           if previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] == 0: continue.

           if t_prev == 0:

               # transitions to type 0:

               # delta 0 (same color)

               c_curr = c_prev

               current_dp[c_curr][0] = (current_dp[c_curr][0] + previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 1) % MOD

               # delta +1 (different color)

               c_curr = c_prev + 1

               if c_curr <= 2*i:

                   current_dp[c_curr][0] = (current_dp[c_curr][0] + previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 1) % MOD

               # transition to type 1:

               c_curr = c_prev + 1

               if c_curr <= 2*i:

                   current_dp[c_curr][1] = (current_dp[c_curr][1] + previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 2) % MOD

           else: # t_prev == 1

               # transition to type 0:

               c_curr = c_prev

               current_dp[c_curr][0] = (current_dp[c_curr][0] + previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 2) % MOD

               # transition to type 1:

               c_curr = c_prev

               current_dp[c_curr][1] = (current_dp[c_curr][1] + previous_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 2) % MOD

   previous_dp = current_dp

After processing all columns, sum the values in previous_dp[k][0] and previous_dp[k][1], then take modulo 998244353.

But wait, after processing all n columns, the answer is the sum of previous_dp[k][0] and previous_dp[k][1].

Now, the code needs to handle the transitions correctly.

But wait, in the code:

For each i from 2 to n:

   current_dp is initialized to all zeros.

   Then, for each possible c_prev and t_prev:

       process transitions.

But in Python, we can represent previous_dp and current_dp as lists of lists.

But for efficiency, since each step only depends on the previous step, we can use two separate arrays.

So, the code outline:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 998244353

                        curr_dp[curr_c][0] = (curr_dp[curr_c][0] + prev_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 1) % MOD

                    curr_c = c_prev +1

But the example input 3 4 expects output 12. So there must be a mistake in the code.

Ah, I see the error. The code as written only considers transitions up to 2*(i-1) for c_prev. For i=3, this is 2*2=4. So in the loop for c_prev in 0 to 2*(i-1).

But for i=3, the code is processing c_prev up to 4.

But in prev_dp for i=2, the maximum c_prev is 2 (from i=2, possible c_prev up to 2*(i-1) =4, but prev_dp after i=2 may have entries up to c_prev=2).

Wait, no. For i=2, the maximum possible c is 2*2=4. But in our example, after i=2, prev_dp has entries for c_prev=1, 2, but not 3 or 4.

So during i=3's loop, c_prev ranges up to 4, but prev_dp entries for c_prev=3 and 4 are zero.

So, the code will process c_prev up to 4, but for those c_prev, prev_dp is zero.

Thus, the code for i=3 is missing transitions that would contribute to c=4.

But in the example input 3,4, the answer is 12. So where is this value coming from?

Let's re-examine the transitions.

For i=3, when processing c_prev=3, which may be present after i=2.

Wait, perhaps the code's loop for c_prev is not correctly capturing all possible c_prev values.

Wait, in the code, during the loop for i=2, after processing, prev_dp has c_prev=1, 2, and possibly others. Then, for i=3, the loop for c_prev runs from 0 to 4 (since 2*(i-1) = 2*2=4).

But in reality, after i=2, the maximum c_prev is 2 (from the prev_dp after i=2). So for i=3, the code is processing c_prev up to 4, but there's no data there.

But this is correct, as the code loops through all possible c_prev values, but prev_dp[c_prev][t_prev] is zero except for c_prev=1,2.

Thus, the code for i=3 won't process any transitions that lead to c=4. But according to the sample input, the answer is 12 for 3,4.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

But why? Because the sample input has a solution where after 3 columns, there are 4 components. How is that possible?

Let's think of a possible coloring.

For example, in the first column: type 1 (2 components), second column type 1 (2 components), third column type 1 (2 components). But then the total components could be 2 + 2 + 2, but some may be merged.

Wait, the sample input's explanation says that one of the possible bicolorings in sample 1 has 4 components. So there must be a way to have 4 components after 3 columns.

But according to the code's current logic, after 3 columns, the possible components are up to 3*2=6, but the sample requires 4.

So, the code must be missing some transitions.

Ah, here's the mistake. In the code, for t_prev=0 and current type 0, the delta is 0 or 1, but when transitioning from t_prev=0 to type 0, the color can be same or different, leading to delta 0 or 1.

But when transitioning from t_prev=0 to type 0 (same color), delta is 0. But when previous column is type 0 (same color) and current is type 0 (same color), the current column is merged into the previous's component, so no new component is added. So the component count remains the same.

But when transitioning from type 0 to type 0 (different color), delta is +1, adding a new component.

So, for example, a sequence of columns:

Column 1: type 0 (color A), component count 1.

Column 2: type 0 (color B, different), component count 1+1=2.

Column 3: type 0 (color C, different from B), component count 2+1=3.

But this would lead to 3 components for 3 columns. But how to reach 4?

Ah, perhaps with a combination of transitions. For example:

Column 1: type 1 (components 2).

Column 2: type 1 ( components 2 + 0 delta → 2).

Column 3: type 1 ( components 2 +0 → 2).

But no. Wait, transitions from type 1 to type 1 add 0 delta. So if all three columns are type 1, the component count is 2 (first column) → 2 (second) → 2 (third).

Not helpful.

Alternatively:

Column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 0 (color same as previous's top → component count 2 (from type 1 to type 0, delta 0).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 → component count 2+1=3).

But sample input 3 requires k=4.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a different combination.

For example:

Column 1: type 0 (color A) → 1 component.

Column 2: type 1 → delta +1 → 2 components.

Column 3: type 1 → delta +1 → 3 components.

But sample input requires 4 components.

Alternatively:

Column 1: type 1 → 2 components.

Column 2: type 0 (different color) → delta +1 → 3 components.

Column 3: type 1 → delta +1 → 4 components.

Yes, this would give 4 components.

So the code should account for this case.

In this scenario:

i=1: type 1 → c=2.

i=2: transition from type 1 to type 0 (different color), delta is +1? Wait no.

Wait, transitions from type 1 to type 0 have delta 0.

So, for i=2:

previous column is type 1 (c=2).

current column is type 0. The delta is 0, so c remains 2.

Hmm, this is not helpful.

Another scenario:

Column 1: type 0 → c=1.

Column 2: type 1 → delta +1 → c=2.

Column 3: type 1 → delta +1 → c=3.

But sample input is 3 columns and k=4.

Hmm, I'm not able to see how to reach 4 components. The sample input says the answer is 12, so there must be 12 ways to get 4 components with n=3.

But according to the code after i=3, the sum of curr_dp[4][0] and curr_dp[4][1] is zero. But this contradicts the sample.

So the code must have a mistake.

Ah, the error is in the transitions for type 0 to type 1. When the previous column is type 0, and current column is type 1, the delta is +1. But according to the code, it's adding 1 to the component count. However, perhaps the actual delta is +1 or +2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier analysis of the delta for transition from type 0 to type 1.

Revisiting this:

Previous column is type 0 (same color, color A).

Current column is type 1 (two different colors).

In this case, the previous column's two cells are A. The current column's two cells are B and C (B != C).

But since the previous column's cells are A, and the current's cells are B and C, which are different.

But for type 1, the current column's cells are two different colors. So B and C can be A and non-A, or non-A and A.

For example, B = A, C = non-A.

In this case, the top cell of current column (B=A) is adjacent to previous's top cell (A), so merged. The bottom cell (C) is new.

But since current column's cells are B and C (different), they are not merged. So the current column contributes one new component (C).

So delta is +1.

But for each possible color choice of type 1, there are two possibilities (B=A and C=non-A, or B=non-A and C=A). So the delta is +1 for both options.

Thus, the code's transition from type 0 to type 1 is correct: delta +1, options 2.

But how to reach k=4 with n=3.

Let's see another possible scenario:

Column 1: type 0 (color A) → c=1.

Column 2: type 0 (color B, different) → c=1+1=2.

Column 3: type 0 (color C, different) → c=2+1=3.

Column 3 can't reach 4 in this scenario.

Another scenario:

Column 1: type 0 (c=1).

Column 2: type 1 (c=1+1=2).

Column 3: type 1 (c=2+1=3).

But still not 4.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 1 (c=2).

Column 2: type 1 (c=2+0=2).

Column 3: type 1 (c=2+0=2).

No.

Alternatively:

Column 1: type 0 (c=1).

Column 2: type 0 (different color) → c=2.

Column 3: type 1 → delta +1 → c=3.

No.

Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the way the transitions are handled.

Perhaps the code should have some other transitions that increase the component count by more than 1.

Wait, the code for transitions from type 0 to type 0 (different color) increases the component count by 1. But what if there are previous columns that are type 0 and adding a new type 0 (different color) adds a new component.

Yes. For example:

Column 1: type 0 (A).

Column 2: type 0 (B != A). So components: 1 (from column 1) +1 (column 2) → 2.

Column 3: type 0 (C != B). So components: 2 +1 =3.

But this gives 3 components for 3 columns. Still not 4.

But how to get 4 components.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

Column 3: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

No.

Another approach: have multiple type 0 and type 1 transitions.

For example:

Column 1: type 1 (c=2).

Column 2: type 0 (delta 0 → c=2).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 → c=3).

Still not 4.

Another scenario:

Column 1: type 0 (c=1).

Column 2: type 1 (c=2).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 → c=3).

No.

Wait, maybe there's a scenario where each column adds one component.

But for three columns, that would be 1+1+1=3.

Not enough.

Alternatively, column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 0 (delta 0 → 2).

Column 3: type 0 (different color → delta +1 →3).

Still not 4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's transitions are incorrect for type 0 to type 0 (different color). Let's re-examine that transition.

When transitioning from type 0 to type 0 with different color, the current column forms a new component. So delta is +1.

But what if previous columns are type 0 and the new column is type 0 (different color), but there are other components that could be merged.

Wait, in this scenario:

Column 1: type 0 (color A).

Column 2: type 0 (color B !=A). So component count is 2.

Column 3: type 0 (color C != B). So component count is 3.

But for three columns, this gives 3 components. Still not 4.

Ah, perhaps there's a scenario where some columns are type 1 and add two components.

Wait, but type 1 always adds 1 component when transitioning from type 0.

Wait, when transitioning from type 0 to type 1, delta is +1.

But when the previous column is type 1 and current is type 1, delta is 0.

So how to get a delta of +2.

Ah, there's no transition in the code that allows delta +2. So perhaps the code is missing some transitions.

This suggests that the initial analysis of the transitions was incorrect.

Wait, let's re-express the transitions.

For example, when previous column is type 0 (color A), and current column is type 1.

The current column's two cells are B and C (B != C).

If B != A and C != A:

But wait, in type 1, the two cells are different, so B and C are different. For example, A is black. Then B can be white and C black, which is allowed. But in that case, C = A. So B is different from A.

So in this case, the current's top cell (B = white) is different from previous's top (black), so no connection. The current's bottom cell (C = black) is same as previous's top (black), so connected.

So the current's bottom cell is merged into previous's component. The current's top cell is a new component. So delta is +1.

But what if both B and C are different from A?

But type 1 requires B and C to be different. So if A is black, B and C must be white and black. So one of them is same as A. So this case is not possible. Thus, the delta is always +1.

Thus, in the code, transitions from type 0 to type 1 always add delta +1.

So the code's logic is correct.

But why the sample input returns 12 when according to the code after 3 columns, there are no entries for k=4?

This suggests that the code is not handling some transitions correctly.

Ah, perhaps the code's loop for c_prev is not correctly set to the maximum possible c_prev.

In the code, for i=3, the loop runs from c_prev=0 to 2*(i-1) =4.

But after i=2, the maximum possible c_prev is 2 (type 1 and type 0 transitions can add to c_prev).

But for i=3, the code processes c_prev up to 4. But in reality, the prev_dp after i=2 has entries up to c_prev=2.

But during i=3's processing, for c_prev=3 and 4, prev_dp is zero.

Thus, no transitions from those c_prev contribute to curr_dp.

But how to reach k=4 in the sample input?

Ah, I think the mistake is in the code's handling of the transitions from type 0 to type 1.

Let me re-examine the code for transitions from type 0 to type 1.

In the code:

if t_prev == 0:

   # transition to type 1:

   c_curr = c_prev +1

   if c_curr <= max_k:

       curr_dp[c_curr][1] += prev_dp[c_prev][t_prev] * 2

Yes. So for example, if previous c_prev is 3, then c_curr is 4.

But how does c_prev reach 3 during i=3?

Wait, for i=3, previous steps may have c_prev=3.

But how?

Let's see:

For i=3:

During the processing of i=3, the code processes c_prev up to 4.

But for prev_dp after i=2, the maximum c_prev is 2.

Thus, during i=3's processing, there are no transitions from c_prev=3 or 4.

Thus, the code cannot generate c_curr=4 during i=3.

But the sample input requires k=4 for n=3.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

So what is the correct approach?

The mistake must be in the delta values for certain transitions.

Let me re-express the possible component counts for small n.

Sample input 3 4.

The correct answer is 12.

Let me try to find a possible way to get 4 components.

For example:

Columns:

1: type 1 (2 components).

2: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

3: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

No.

Another example:

Columns:

1: type 0 (1 component).

2: type 1 (delta +1 → 2 components).

3: type 0 (delta 0 → 2 components).

No.

Another example:

Columns:

1: type 0 (1 component).

2: type 0 (different color → delta +1 → 2 components).

3: type 0 (different color → delta +1 → 3 components).

No.

Another example:

Columns:

1: type 1 (2 components).

2: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

3: type 0 (delta 0 → 2 components).

No.

Another example:

Columns:

1: type 0 (1 component).

2: type 0 (different → 2).

3: type 1 (delta +1 →3).

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the code is missing transitions where the current column is type 1 and adds two components.

But according to the earlier analysis, this is not possible. Because when the previous column is type 0 and current is type 1, the current column adds one component.

But perhaps there's a scenario where the current column is type 1 and the previous is type 1, leading to a delta of +2.

Wait, earlier analysis for type 1 to type 1 transitions said delta is 0, but perhaps this is incorrect.

Let me re-examine the transition from type 1 to type 1.

Previous column is type 1 (D and E, different).

Current column is type 1 (F and G, different).

If F and G are different from D and E.

Wait, but D and E are black and white, so F and G can be black and white or white and black. Thus, F and G can't be different from both D and E.

For example, previous column's type 1 is black and white. Current column's type 1 can be white and black, which is the same colors but reversed.

In that case:

Current's top cell (white) is connected to previous's bottom cell (white). Current's bottom cell (black) is connected to previous's top cell (black). Thus, the two previous components (top and bottom) are merged via the current column's cells. Because the current's top is connected to previous's bottom (same color), and current's bottom is connected to previous's top (same color). But since the current's top and bottom are different colors, they are not connected, so the previous's top and bottom components remain separate.

So the current column's top and bottom cells are part of the previous's bottom and top components, respectively. But since those are separate components, the current column does not merge them. So delta is 0.

Thus, the code's delta of 0 for type 1 to type 1 transitions is correct.

So why is the sample input's answer 12?

Perhaps there's a mistake in the code's handling of the transitions from type 0 to type 1.

Let's think of another scenario where the component count increases by more than 1.

For example, previous column is type 0 (color A), current column is type 1 (B and C).

If B != A and C != A.

But as before, this is impossible because type 1 requires B and C to be different. So B and C can't both be different from A, because then B and C would have to be the same, which is not allowed.

For example, if A is black, B and C must be white and black. So one of them is same as A.

Thus, delta is +1.

Thus, there's no scenario where delta is +2.

Thus, the code's logic is correct.

But sample input 3 4 requires k=4. How?

The code's current logic for n=3 and k=4 would return 0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code must have a mistake.

Ah, I think I found the mistake.

In the code, during the transition from type 0 to type 0 with different color, the delta is +1.

But when the previous column is type 0 (same color), and the current column is type 0 (different color), the current column is a new component. But what if the previous column is not the first column?

For example:

Columns 1 and 2 are type 0 with different colors (c=2).

Adding a third column type 0 with different color from column 2 (c=3).

But according to the code, this is possible.

But for n=3, this would give c=3, not 4.

But sample input requires c=4.

So this suggests that the code is missing transitions where multiple components are added per column.

But according to the problem statement, the maximum possible k is 2n. For n=3, it's 6. But the sample input has k=4. So there must be a way.

Perhaps the code's mistake is in the initial state.

For example, the first column:

If it's type 0, it contributes 1 component. If type 1, contributes 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So what's the correct way to get 4 components with n=3.

Let me think of a possible arrangement:

Column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

Column 3: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

No.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 0 (1 component).

Column 2: type 1 (delta +1 → 2).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 →3).

No.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 0.

Column 2: type 0 (different → 2).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 →3).

No.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 1 (2).

Column 2: type 0 (different → 2 +1=3).

Column 3: type 0 (different → 3 +1=4).

Yes! This would result in 4 components.

So:

i=1: type 1 → c=2.

i=2: transition from type 1 to type 0 (different color) → delta +1 → c=3.

i=3: transition from type 0 to type 0 (different color) → delta +1 → c=4.

So this would give k=4.

Thus, the code must capture this.

But according to the code's logic:

For i=2, processing c_prev=2 (type 1) and transitioning to type 0 (delta 0).

Wait, no. Transitioning from type 1 to type 0 has delta 0. So in this scenario, it's not possible.

Ah, here's the mistake. The code's transition from type 1 to type 0 has delta 0. But in the scenario where the previous column is type 1 and the current column is type 0, but with a different color than the previous's, then the current column should add a new component.

Wait, no. According to earlier analysis, when transitioning from type 1 to type 0, the current column's color is either the same as the previous's top or bottom color. Thus, the current column is merged into one of the previous's components, leading to delta 0.

So, in the scenario where column 2 is type 0 (color different from column 1's type 1), but according to the code's logic, the delta is 0.

But this contradicts the scenario where the current column's type 0 is a different color than the previous's type 1. But according to the code's logic, the delta is 0.

Thus, the code is incorrect.

Ah! This is the key mistake.

Revisiting the transition from type 1 to type 0.

Previous column is type 1 (D and E, different colors).

Current column is type 0 (C).

The current column's color C can be D or E.

If C is D: the current column's cells are merged into the previous's top component (D). previous's bottom component (E) remains. So delta 0.

If C is E: merged into previous's bottom component. Delta 0.

But what if C is different from both D and E?

But D and E are different, so one is black and the other white. Thus, C can't be different from both. So C must be either D or E.

Thus, the delta is always 0.

Thus, the code's transition from type 1 to type 0 is correct.

Thus, the scenario where previous column is type 1 and current column is type 0 with different color (C is different from D and E) is impossible. Because D and E are black and white, so C can only be black or white, which is either D or E.

Thus, the transition from type 1 to type 0 has delta 0.

Thus, the code's logic is correct.

So in the scenario where the previous column is type 1 and current column is type 0, the delta is 0.

Thus, the code's code for this transition is correct.

Thus, the scenario where the code is missing transitions to reach k=4 for n=3 must be due to another reason.

Another possible scenario:

Column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 0 (same color as previous's top → delta 0 → 2 components).

Column 3: type 0 (different color → delta +1 → 3 components).

Still not 4.

Another possible scenario:

Column 1: type 0 (1 component).

Column 2: type 1 (delta +1 → 2 components).

Column 3: type 0 (different color → delta +1 → 3 components).

Still not 4.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 1 (2 components).

Column 2: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

Column 3: type 1 (0 delta → 2 components).

No.

Another possibility:

Column 1: type 0 (1 component).

Column 2: type 0 (different → 2 components).

Column 3: type 1 (delta +1 →3 components).

No.

Thus, it's unclear how to achieve 4 components for n=3.

But the sample input says it's possible, so the code must be incorrect.

Thus, there must be a mistake in the code's transitions.

Another possible error is in the transition from type 1 to type 1.

Perhaps when the current column is type 1 and the previous is type 1, but the current's colors are swapped, the delta is not 0.

But earlier analysis said delta is 0.

But perhaps when the previous column is type 1 (D and E), and current column is type 1 (E and D), the components are merged.

Wait, in this case:

Previous column's top is D, bottom is E.

Current column's top is E, bottom is D.

The current's top (E) is adjacent to previous's bottom (E), so merged into previous's bottom component.

Current's bottom (D) is adjacent to previous's top (D), merged into previous's top component.

Thus, the current's two cells are part of the previous's two components. So the total components remain 2. Thus, delta is 0.

Thus, code's logic is correct.

Thus, the code seems to be correct, but the sample input is not matching.

But why?

Ah! The mistake is in the code's handling of the maximum possible k.

In the code, max_k is set to 2*n.

But in reality, the maximum possible k for n columns is 2n, which is correct.

But in the code's transitions, for example, when transitioning from type 0 to type 0 (different color) multiple times, the component count increases by 1 each time.

For n=3, this would allow for a component count of 3 (if all transitions are type 0 and different colors).

But the sample input requires k=4. Thus, there must be a way to have higher component counts.

But according to the transitions, the maximum component count for n columns is n (if all transitions are type 0, different colors) → each adds 1 component.

But for n=3, that's 3 components. So sample input's k=4 is larger than the maximum possible, but the sample input shows that it's possible.

Thus, this implies that the initial analysis of the transitions is incorrect.

Thus, there's a fundamental error in the approach.

Thus, the code is incorrect.

This suggests that the initial analysis of the transitions and delta is incorrect.

Thus, the entire approach needs to be re-examined.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps the state should track the number of components and the way the current column's colors are arranged, including how they connect to the previous column.

This requires a more detailed state.

For example, for each column, track:

- The color pattern (type 0 or type 1).

- How the components are merged between the current and previous columns.

Thus, the state can be modeled with more detailed information, such as:

For the previous column's pattern and the current column's pattern, how many new components are added.

But this would require tracking the previous and current patterns and the number of connections between them.

This seems complex but is necessary.

Let's consider each possible transition between two columns and compute the delta in components.

Possible column patterns (A and B are the two cells of the previous column, C and D are the current column's cells):

For each possible combination of previous and current patterns:

Previous pattern: type 0 (A, A).

Current pattern: type 0 (C, C).

If C == A: previous and current are merged into a single component. Delta 0.

If C != A: current is a new component. Delta +1.

Previous pattern: type 0 (A, A).

Current pattern: type 1 (C, D), where C != D.

If C == A and D != A: current's top merges with previous's component. current's bottom is a new component. Delta +1.

If D == A and C != A: current's bottom merges with previous's component. current's top is new component. Delta +1.

If C != A and D != A: both current's cells are new components. But since C and D are different, they form two new components. So delta +2.

But wait, previous pattern is type 0 (A, A).

Current pattern is type 1 (C, D), C != D.

If C != A and D != A:

- current's top (C) is not connected to previous's top (A).

- current's bottom (D) is not connected to previous's bottom (A).

Thus, current's top and bottom form two new components. So delta +2.

But this is only possible if C and D are different from A.

But type 1's colors are C and D (different), and A is the previous's color. So C and D can be different from A only if A is one color, and C and D are the other. But since they must be different, for example:

If A is black, then C and D must be white and black. So one of them is white (different from A), and the other is black (same as A). Thus, it's impossible to have both C and D different from A.

Thus, the delta can't be +2 for type 0 to type 1 transitions.

But this suggests that the initial analysis was incorrect. There's a case where current column's type 1 has both colors different from previous's type 0 color, leading to delta +2.

But according to the problem's constraints, this is impossible. Thus, the initial analysis was correct, and delta for type 0 to type 1 transitions is always +1.

Thus, the code's logic is correct.

But the sample input requires k=4 for n=3, which is impossible according to the code's transitions. So there must be a mistake.

This suggests that the initial approach is wrong. Perhaps the way components are counted when merging between columns is more complex than previously thought.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps we need to model the state in terms of the current column's pattern and the number of connected components between the two rows.

This is a common approach in grid problems where the connection between adjacent columns is important.

In this case, for each column, the state can be defined by:

- The pattern of the current column (type 0 or type 1).

- The way the current column's cells are connected to the previous column's cells, if any.

This is often modeled using a mask or a state that describes the connectivity between the two rows.

For example, the state can be represented as the number of components in the first i columns, and the way the current column's cells are connected to each other and to the previous column.

But this requires a more detailed state representation.

For example, the state can track:

- The number of components up to column i.

- The connectivity between the two cells of the current column.

- How the current column's cells are connected to the previous column's cells.

This is similar to the DP approach used in problems like "Count the number of ways to tile a grid with dominoes" or "Count the number of ways to fill a grid with certain connectivity constraints".

This approach is more complex but may be necessary.

Let's model the state as follows:

Each column can be in
