<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the number of subsequences in the first l elements of the array such that their XOR sum is x. And we need to handle up to 1e5 queries efficiently. The constraints are tight, so we need a smart approach.

First, I remember that the XOR sum of a subset has some linear algebra properties when viewed in binary. Like, the set of possible XOR sums forms a vector space over GF(2). So maybe we can model the array elements as building a basis for this space. The basis would allow us to determine if a certain x is reachable and then calculate the number of subsets that produce it.

Wait, right. The idea is similar to the linear basis concept. Let's think: when processing elements one by one, we can build a basis for the XOR subspace. The basis vectors are such that each new element either increases the rank of the basis or not. The basis is built in a way that each new vector is added only if it's independent of the current basis.

Now, for each query (l, x), we need to look at the first l elements and their basis. Then, determine if x is in their subspace. If not, the answer is 0. If yes, the number of subsets is 2^(k), where k is the number of elements not in the basis (since each such element can be either included or excluded as long as their contribution is canceled out by the basis elements).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard approach for counting subsets with XOR sum x is as follows: the number of subsets is 0 if x is not in the basis. Otherwise, it's 2^(total elements - basis size), multiplied by some factor if the empty set is considered. Wait, but in this problem, the empty set is allowed. So, for example, if the basis is of size r, then the number of subsets that produce a particular x (that is in the subspace) is 2^(l - r), where l is the number of elements considered. But wait, no. Because the basis is constructed with some elements, and the other elements can be expressed as a combination of the basis. So when you have a basis of size r, the total number of elements is l. So the number of free variables is l - r. For each such free element, including or excluding it in the subset can be adjusted by the basis elements. So the total number of subsets that produce a certain x is 2^(l - r) if x is in the subspace, else 0.

So the steps are:

1. For each prefix of the array (up to l elements), maintain the basis of their XOR subspace.
2. For each query (l, x), check if x is in the basis of the first l elements. If not, output 0.
3. If yes, the answer is 2^(number of elements in the prefix - basis size) modulo 1e9+7. But wait, how does the empty set factor into this?

Wait, the empty set has XOR 0. So the formula 2^(k) where k is the number of elements not in the basis. Because each of those elements can be included or not, and their inclusion can be canceled by the basis. So the count is 2^(l - r) if x is achievable, where r is the rank of the basis for the first l elements.

Wait, let's see. Suppose we have a basis B with r elements. The number of elements processed up to l is l. The number of elements not in the basis is l - r. For each such element, they can be either included or excluded, and the basis elements can be adjusted to compensate for their inclusion. So the total number of subsets that generate any specific XOR value in the subspace is 2^(l - r). But wait, the empty subset is one of those. For example, in the sample input:

First sample input has 5 elements, and in the first query, l=4, x=3. The output is 4.

Let's see. The first 4 elements are 0,1,2,3. The basis for these elements: 0,1,2,3. Wait, but adding 0 to the basis would not contribute anything, right. Because 0's binary representation is all zeros, so when building the basis, inserting 0 won't change the basis. So the basis after first 4 elements would be of size 3 (assuming 0 is the first element, then 1, then 2, then 3 is added? Wait, no. Let's think about the basis construction.

The standard way to build a basis is to process each number and insert it into the basis. For each number, we go from the highest bit to the lowest. If the current number has a bit set that isn't in the basis, we add it. Otherwise, we XOR with the existing basis element and proceed. So inserting 0 would not change the basis since all its bits are 0. So the first element (0) would not contribute. Then adding 1 (binary 1) would add a new basis element. Then 2 (10) adds another. Then 3 (11) would be processed: the highest bit is 1 (since 3 is 11 in binary, the highest bit is 1, but 2's highest bit is 2nd position. Wait, maybe the bits are considered in descending order. So for each number, check the highest set bit. For example, 3 is 11 in binary, which is highest bit at position 1 (assuming 0-based). Then, when adding 3 to the basis, since the basis already has 1 (bit 0) and 2 (bit 1). Wait, 3's highest bit is 1 (since 2^1=2, 3 >= 2). So when adding 3, we check if there's a basis element for bit 1. Yes, which is 2. Then we XOR 3 with 2, getting 1. Then check for the next lower bit (bit 0). There's a basis element (1). XOR with that gives 0. So 3 can't be added to the basis, so the basis size remains 2. Wait, but the initial elements are 0, 1, 2, 3.

Wait, let's walk through building the basis step by step:

Initialize basis as empty.

First element is 0: inserting it into the basis. Since all bits are 0, it doesn't contribute. Basis size remains 0.

Second element is 1. Highest bit is 0. No basis element for bit 0. So add 1 to the basis. Now basis has {1} (size 1).

Third element is 2 (10). Highest bit is 1. No basis element for that bit. Add to basis. Now basis has {1, 2} (size 2).

Fourth element is 3 (11). Highest bit is 1 (since 3 in binary is 11, which is 2^1 + 1). We have a basis element for bit 1 (2). So we XOR 3 with 2, getting 1. Now, check the next highest bit (0). We have a basis element for bit 0 (1). So XOR with 1, getting 0. So 3 can't be added. Basis remains size 2.

So the basis after first 4 elements is size 2. So for l=4, the number of elements is 4, but the basis size is 2. So the number of subsets would be 2^(4 - 2) =4, which matches the first sample output (4). That makes sense. So the formula seems correct.

Another sample input is:

3 2

1 1 1

Queries 3 1 and 2 0.

For the first query, l=3. The elements are 1,1,1. The basis for these elements:

First element 1: added. Basis size 1.

Second element 1: process. Highest bit is 0. Basis has 1. XOR with 1 gives 0. So can't add. Basis size remains 1.

Third element 1: same as before. Basis size remains 1.

So the basis size is 1. So the number of subsets is 2^(3-1) = 4. Which matches the sample output.

For the second query (l=2, x=0), the elements are 1,1. Basis size is 1. So 2^(2-1)=2. But how does x=0 fit here?

Wait, the empty subset has XOR 0. So when x=0, how does it fit into the formula. Wait, the formula says that if x is in the subspace, then the answer is 2^(l - r). But in the basis built from the first l elements, the possible xors are the subspace generated by the basis. So in the first case, the basis is {1}, so possible xors are 0 and 1. Wait, no. Wait, the basis elements themselves generate all possible xors. For example, with basis {1}, the possible xors are 0 (empty subset) and 1. So for x=0, it is in the subspace. So the number of subsets would be 2^(3-1) =4. But in the sample query (3,1), the answer is 4. Which includes all subsets that XOR to 1, including the empty subset? Wait, no. Wait, the empty subset's XOR is 0, so it's not part of the subsets that sum to x=1. So maybe the formula isn't quite right.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express this. The number of subsets that XOR to x is equal to 2^(k), where k is the number of elements that are not in the basis (the redundant elements). But this is only true if x is in the subspace generated by the basis.

But in that case, the empty set is considered. For example, in the first case, where x=3. The basis is size 2 (for l=4). The redundant elements are 4-2=2, so 2^2=4 subsets. But how do these subsets include the empty set?

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct. Because the basis allows you to form any x in the subspace in exactly one way, and the redundant elements can be included or not, as their inclusion can be canceled out by some combination of basis elements. So for each redundant element, you have the choice to include it or not, which doubles the number of subsets. So the formula is indeed 2^(l - r) if x is in the subspace. So for x=0, which is in the subspace, the answer would be 2^(l - r), which includes the empty subset.

Wait, let's take the second sample input's second query: l=2, x=0. The elements are 1,1. The basis after two elements is {1} (since the second 1 is redundant). So r=1. l=2. So 2^(2-1) = 2. Which matches the sample output. So the answer is 2. The possible subsets are the empty set and the subset {1,1} (which XOR to 0). So that's correct. So the formula works here.

So the key steps are:

- Precompute for each prefix (for each l) the basis and the count of elements so far (l), and the size of the basis (r). Then for each query (l, x), check if x is in the basis. If not, output 0. If yes, compute 2^(l - r) modulo 1e9+7.

But how to precompute the basis for each prefix efficiently?

Since n can be up to 1e5, and each element is up to 2^20, we need a way to track the basis incrementally as elements are added. For each new element, we can update the basis. So for each prefix, we can store the basis and its size. Then, for any l, the basis up to l is known.

But how to store the basis for each l? Because for 1e5 elements, that's 1e5 bases. Storing the entire basis for each l would be O(n * 20) space, which is manageable (since 20 is small). But for each l, the basis is built incrementally from the previous. So we can represent the basis as a list of 20 elements (since each element is up to 2^20, so maximum 20 bits). For each l, we can track the current basis (array of 20 elements) and the size (r).

So the plan is:

- Initialize a list (array) of bases for each prefix. But that would take O(n * 20) space, which is 2e6, acceptable.

Alternatively, we can track the basis incrementally. For each new element, we can attempt to insert it into the current basis. If it changes the basis, then the new basis is a copy of the previous with one more element. But since we need to have the basis for each prefix (l=1, l=2, ... l=n), we can't reuse the same array, because inserting a new element may modify the existing basis.

Wait, but when building the basis for the prefix up to l, the basis is the same as the basis for l-1 elements, except that if the l-th element can be added to the basis. So, for each l, we can track the basis as a list of 20 elements (each of which is the highest possible bit for that position), and the size (r) of the basis.

But when processing the l-th element, we can make a copy of the previous basis, then attempt to insert the new element into this copy. If the insertion is possible, the basis for l is the updated copy. Otherwise, it's the same as the previous basis.

Wait, but making a copy for each l would be O(n * 20) time and space, which is acceptable for n=1e5 and 20 bits.

So the approach would be:

Initialize a list of bases. For each l from 1 to n:

   current_basis = copy of previous basis (from l-1)
   insert a[l] into current_basis (using standard basis insertion method)
   store current_basis and the size r for this l.

But for each element, the basis can be up to 20 elements. So for each l, we need to store 20 integers. That's 1e5 * 20 = 2e6 integers. Which is manageable.

So for each l, we can store the basis (as a list of 20 elements, with possible zeros) and the size r. However, even better, for each l, when we process the element a[l], we can create a new basis array by taking the previous basis and inserting the new element. But inserting into the basis may modify some positions.

But how to track the basis for each l efficiently?

An alternative approach is to track for each l the maximum basis possible up to that l, but since each new element can only add to the basis (the basis can't lose elements as l increases), but that's not true. For example, inserting a new element that can reduce the basis? No, because the basis is built incrementally. Once elements are added, the basis is maintained in a way that higher bits are considered first. So each new element can only add to the basis if it introduces a new highest bit not present before.

Wait, the basis is built by inserting elements in the order they are processed. So when processing the first l elements, the basis is built by inserting each element from the first to the l-th. So each new element can only add to the basis if it's linearly independent of the previous ones. So the basis can only grow in size as l increases. Wait no. Wait, for example, if earlier elements have lower bits, and a later element has a higher bit. When you insert the later element first, then the basis includes that higher bit. But if you insert the elements in a different order, the basis may have different elements. But in our case, the elements are processed in the order of the array, so each new element is added to the basis in the order of the array.

Wait, but the standard basis insertion method is order-dependent. For example, inserting 1 then 2 gives a basis of {1, 2}. Inserting 2 then 1 gives the same basis. Wait, no. Let's see: when inserting 2 first, highest bit is 1. So the basis starts with 2. Then inserting 1: highest bit is 0, which is not present in the basis, so it's added. So the basis is {2, 1}. But if inserted in the opposite order, it's {1, 2}. The actual basis vectors are different, but they span the same space. So for our purposes, the basis order doesn't matter as long as the space is correct.

But when processing elements in the array order, the basis for the first l elements is the basis built by inserting a_1, then a_2, ..., a_l in that order.

So for each l, the basis is built incrementally from the previous l-1 elements. So the basis for l elements is the same as the basis for l-1 elements, possibly with a new element added (if a_l is linearly independent of the basis up to l-1).

So the basis can only grow or stay the same. So for each l, the basis size is r_l, which is >= r_{l-1}.

This is an important observation. So the basis size is non-decreasing as l increases.

This means that for each l, the basis is the same as for l-1, or has one more element. So when we process each element, we can track the basis and its size incrementally.

Thus, for each l in 1..n, we can track:

- basis: an array where basis[i] is the value of the basis element for bit i (or 0 if none exists).

Wait, the standard way to represent the basis is for each bit level, starting from the highest down. So for each element, when inserting into the basis, we check the highest bit set. For that bit, if there's no existing basis element, we add the element. Otherwise, we XOR the element with the existing basis element and repeat the process. This process ensures that the basis is in a form where each element has a unique highest bit.

So the basis is stored as an array where each position corresponds to a bit. For example, for bits 0 to 19 (since a_i < 2^20), the array has 20 elements. For each bit i, basis[i] contains the value of the basis element that has its highest set bit at i. If basis[i] is 0, then there is no element in the basis with that highest bit.

So the basis is represented as a list of 20 integers, where each is either 0 or a basis element with the highest bit at that position.

So for each l, we can store this basis array. But since the basis can only accumulate elements (since each new element can't reduce the basis), but when inserting a new element, some basis elements may be modified (like, when inserting an element that has a lower highest bit but when XORed with higher basis elements may introduce a new element for a lower bit). Wait, no. Because the insertion process ensures that each basis element is the highest possible. For example, when inserting an element, you start with its highest bit. If there's a basis element for that bit, you XOR with it, which reduces the element's current value and possibly lower its highest bit. You then repeat until you can't proceed further. If the element becomes zero, it's redundant. Otherwise, you add it to the basis at the position of its highest bit.

So inserting a new element may change the basis elements for lower bits, but the basis's span remains the same. Wait, no. The basis is being modified, but the span (the set of possible XOR combinations) is the same as before plus the new element if it was added.

Wait, for example, suppose we have a basis with elements {3 (11), 4 (100)}. Then inserting 1 (0001). Let's see:

The highest bit of 1 is 0. Check if basis[0] exists. Suppose basis[0] is 0. So we add 1 to basis[0]. Now the basis elements are 3 (11), 4 (100), 1 (001). But wait, the highest bit of 3 is 1 (since 3 is 11 in binary, which is 2^1 + 1, so the highest bit is 1). The basis for bit 0 is now 1. So after inserting 1, the basis elements are:

basis[0] =1, basis[1] =3, basis[2]=4.

But before inserting 1, the basis for bit 0 was 0 (so no element). So inserting 1 increases the basis size by 1.

But in this scenario, the basis after insertion includes the new element, which allows the span to include all previous elements plus the new possibilities from the added basis.

So for the purpose of this problem, the basis for each l is being built incrementally. So for each l, when we add a new element a_l, we create a copy of the previous basis (for l-1), then insert a_l into it. If the insertion is successful (the element isn't redundant), then the new basis is stored. Otherwise, the basis remains the same.

But making a copy of the basis (array of 20 integers) for each l would take O(20) per l. For 1e5 l's, that's 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.

So the steps are:

- Precompute for each l from 1 to n the basis array and the size r (number of non-zero elements in the basis array). Also, track for each l the current size r.

But storing the basis array for each l is expensive in terms of memory. Wait, for each l, we can't store the entire basis array (20 elements) because 1e5 * 20 = 2e6 integers. Which is manageable, since each is a 20-bit number, so even in Python, that's 2e6 * 4 bytes (approx 8MB), which is acceptable.

So, in Python, we can represent the bases as a list of lists. For each l, bases[l] is the basis array (size 20) after processing the first l elements.

But since l can be up to 1e5, and for each l we need to store 20 integers, this is feasible.

So the precomputation steps are:

Initialize a list of basis arrays. Let's say we have a list called 'prefix_bases', where prefix_bases[i] is the basis array after processing the first i elements. Also, have a list called 'prefix_r' where prefix_r[i] is the size of the basis after i elements.

Initialize prefix_bases[0] as a list of 20 zeros. Then, for each i from 1 to n:

   current_basis = a copy of prefix_bases[i-1]
   insert a[i-1] (since in Python, the array is 0-based) into current_basis using the standard basis insertion method.
   compute the new_r as the sum of 1 for each non-zero element in current_basis.
   prefix_bases.append(current_basis)
   prefix_r.append(new_r)

But inserting into the basis is O(20) time per element, so for 1e5 elements, it's 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.

Once we have this precomputed, for each query (l, x), we can:

1. Retrieve the basis for the first l elements (prefix_bases[l]).
2. Check if x can be represented using this basis. This is done by trying to reduce x using the basis. If after XORing with the basis elements in the standard way, the result is zero, then x is in the subspace. Else, it's not.
3. If not in the subspace, answer is 0.
4. Else, the answer is 2^(l - r) mod 1e9+7, where r is prefix_r[l].

But how to compute 2^(l - r) efficiently for many queries?

We can precompute a list of powers of 2 modulo 1e9+7 up to 1e5. Since l can be up to 1e5, the exponent l - r can be up to 1e5. So precompute an array pow2 where pow2[k] = (2^k) mod MOD for k from 0 to 1e5.

But for each query, l can be up to 1e5, so the maximum exponent is 1e5. So precompute pow2 up to 1e5.

Wait, but l can be up to 1e5, and r can be as low as 0 (if all elements are zero). So l - r can be up to 1e5. So precompute pow2 up to 1e5.

So precompute pow2 as follows:

pow2 = [1] * (n+1)
for i in 1 to n:
   pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD

So for a query with exponent e = l - r, the answer is pow2[e].

Putting it all together:

Precompute prefix_bases and prefix_r for each l up to n.

Precompute pow2 up to n.

For each query (l, x):

   if l is 0, handle (but l starts from 1)
   basis = prefix_bases[l]
   r = prefix_r[l]
   check if x can be formed with basis.
   if not, output 0.
   else, compute e = l - r, output pow2[e] mod MOD.

Now, the key challenge is efficiently checking whether x can be formed with the basis. How to do this quickly?

The check is done by attempting to reduce x using the basis. For each bit from highest to lowest (say, 19 down to 0):

   if the current bit is set in x, and there's a basis element for this bit, then XOR x with that basis element.

After processing all bits, if x is zero, then x is in the subspace. Else, no.

This is O(20) per query. Since there are 1e5 queries, that's 2e6 operations, acceptable.

So the steps for checking x in the basis:

def is_in_basis(x, basis):
    for i in reversed(range(20)):
        if (x >> i) & 1:
            if basis[i]:
                x ^= basis[i]
            else:
                return False
    return x == 0

Wait, no. Because the basis is such that each basis[i] has its highest bit at i. So when checking x, we start from the highest bit. For each bit i, if x has that bit set, we check if basis[i] exists. If so, XOR x with basis[i]. This will clear the i-th bit. We proceed until all bits are processed. If after all steps x becomes 0, then it's in the subspace.

So the code would be:

x_copy = x
for i in reversed(range(20)):
    if (x_copy >> i) & 1:
        if basis[i]:
            x_copy ^= basis[i]
        else:
            break
if x_copy == 0:
    return True
else:
    return False

Wait, no. Because even if there's a basis[i], after XORing, it's possible that lower bits are set. But since we process bits from highest to lowest, each step ensures that the highest bit of x_copy is considered. So after processing each bit, the next highest bit is considered.

So the correct way is to process the bits in descending order and for each bit, if the current x has that bit set, and the basis has an element for that bit, then XOR with that element. This will reduce x.

But after doing this for all bits, if x becomes 0, then it's in the subspace.

So the code should be:

def can_represent(x, basis):
    for i in reversed(range(20)):
        if (x >> i) & 1:
            if basis[i]:
                x ^= basis[i]
            else:
                return False
    return x == 0

Wait, but this code returns False only if, during the loop, we encounter a bit that is set in x but the basis has no element for that bit. Otherwise, after processing all bits, x must be zero. So this is the correct way to check.

So for each query x, we use the basis for l elements and run this function. If it returns True, then the answer is 2^(l - r). Else, 0.

Now, putting all together.

Now, the problem is the precomputation of the prefix_bases. For each l, we need to store a list of 20 elements. But for 1e5 l's, this is 1e5 * 20 = 2e6 entries, which is manageable in Python. But in Python, creating a list of lists for 1e5 entries, each of length 20, is feasible.

But how to efficiently implement this?

We can represent prefix_bases as a list, where each entry is a list of 20 integers. But since for each l, the basis is built incrementally from the previous l-1, and each insertion can modify the basis, we need to create a new copy for each l.

But in Python, list.copy() is a shallow copy. So for each new element, we can create a copy of the previous basis and then insert the new a_i into it.

So code steps:

n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
MOD = 10**9 +7

# Precompute prefix_bases and prefix_r
prefix_bases = []
prefix_r = []
current_basis = [0]*20
current_r =0

prefix_bases.append(current_basis.copy())  # for l=0 (but l starts from 1)
prefix_r.append(0)

for num in a:
    # Copy the current basis
    new_basis = current_basis.copy()
    x = num
    for i in reversed(range(20)):
        if (x >> i) & 1:
            if new_basis[i]:
                x ^= new_basis[i]
            else:
                new_basis[i] = x
                break
    # Check if the new_basis is different from current_basis
    # If x was added, then the new_r is current_r +1
    # else, same as current_r
    new_r = current_r
    if x !=0:
        new_r +=1
    # Update current_basis and current_r
    current_basis = new_basis
    current_r = new_r
    # Append to prefix_bases and prefix_r
    prefix_bases.append(current_basis.copy())
    prefix_r.append(current_r)

# Precompute pow2 up to n
max_pow = n
pow2 = [1]*(max_pow +1)
for i in range(1, max_pow+1):
    pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] *2 ) % MOD

# Process queries
for _ in range(q):
    l, x = map(int, input().split())
    basis = prefix_bases[l]
    # Check if x is in the basis
    x_copy = x
    for i in reversed(range(20)):
        if (x_copy >> i) &1:
            if basis[i]:
                x_copy ^= basis[i]
            else:
                break
    if x_copy !=0:
        print(0)
    else:
        e = l - prefix_r[l]
        print(pow2[e] % MOD)

Wait, but in the code above, when inserting the new element into the basis, the code for inserting is:

x = num
for i in reversed(range(20)):
    if (x >> i) &1:
        if new_basis[i]:
            x ^= new_basis[i]
        else:
            new_basis[i] =x
            break

But wait, the standard insertion process is:

def insert(x, basis):
    for i in reversed(range(20)):
        if (x >> i) & 1:
            if basis[i]:
                x ^= basis[i]
            else:
                basis[i] = x
                return
    # if x becomes 0, it's not added

So the code above is correct. For each new element, it is processed into the basis. So the code correctly builds the new basis.

But in the code for precomputing the prefix_bases, when adding a new element, we make a copy of the previous basis, then modify the copy. Then current_basis is set to the new_basis. So each prefix_bases entry is a copy of the current_basis after processing each element.

But this would take O(n*20) time and space, which is acceptable.

Testing this code against the sample inputs:

First sample input:

5 5
0 1 2 3 4
Queries.

Let's process the array step by step.

prefix_bases starts with [0,0,...0], prefix_r 0.

Then for each element:

element 0 (a[0] =0):

x=0. Inserting into new_basis (copy of previous, which is all zeros).

x starts as 0. So in the loop, since x has no bits set, the loop does nothing. x is zero. So new_basis is same as previous. new_r is current_r (0) +0. So prefix_bases[1] is [0...0], prefix_r[1] is 0.

element 1 (a[1]=1):

x=1. For i in 19 downto 0:

i=0: (1 >>0)&1 is 1. new_basis[0] is 0 (from previous step). So set new_basis[0] =1. break.

so new_basis is [1,0,0,...]. new_r =0 +1=1.

prefix_bases[2] is this new basis. prefix_r[2] =1.

element 2 (a[2] =2, binary 10):

x=2. For i from 19 downto 0:

i=1: (2 >>1) is 1. new_basis[1] is 0. So set new_basis[1] =2. break.

new_r=1+1=2.

prefix_bases[3] has [1,2,0,...]. prefix_r[3]=2.

element 3 (a[3]=3, binary 11):

x=3. Process:

i=1: 3>>1 is 1. new_basis[1] is 2. So x ^=2 → 1.

i=0: 1>>0 is 1. new_basis[0] is 1. So x ^=1 →0. loop ends.

So x becomes 0. No change to new_basis. new_r remains 2.

prefix_bases[4] is same as previous. prefix_r[4]=2.

element 4 (a[4]=4, binary 100):

x=4. Process i from 19 downto 0:

i=2: 4>>2 is 1. new_basis[2] is 0. So set new_basis[2] =4. break.

new_r=2+1=3.

prefix_bases[5] has [1,2,4,0...]. prefix_r[5]=3.

Now, for query 4 3 (l=4, x=3):

Check the basis for l=4 (prefix_bases[4] is [1,2,0...0]).

Check x=3:

x_copy=3.

i=19 downto 0:

i=1: 3>>1 is 1. new_basis[1] is 2. So x_copy ^=2 → 1.

i=0: 1>>0 is 1. new_basis[0] is 1. x_copy ^=1 →0. So x_copy is 0. So returns True.

e=4 - prefix_r[4] (which is 2). 4-2=2. 2^2=4. So output 4. Which matches the sample.

Another query: 2 0 (l=2, x=0).

Basis for l=2 is [1,0...]. So check x=0:

x_copy=0. loop doesn't run. returns True. e=2 -1 =1. 2^1=2. Correct.

So the code seems to handle the first sample correctly.

Another sample input:

3 2

1 1 1.

Processing:

element 1: insert 1.

new_basis[0] =1. r=1.

element 2: insert 1.

x=1. process i=0. new_basis[0] is 1. So x ^=1 →0. So no change. new_r remains 1.

element 3: insert 1. same as before. new_r remains 1.

So for l=3, the basis is [1,0,...], r=1. So queries:

3 1: x=1.

Check:

x=1. i=0: basis[0] is 1. XOR with 1 →0. x_copy becomes 0. So returns True. e=3-1=2. 2^2=4. Correct.

2 0: l=2, x=0. Check x=0. returns True. e=2-1=1 →2^1=2. Correct.

So the code works for this sample.

Now, considering the code's efficiency:

The precomputation of prefix_bases is O(n * 20) time and space. The queries are O(q * 20) time. For n and q up to 1e5, this is acceptable.

But in Python, creating a list of 1e5+1 elements, each being a list of 20 integers, might take a lot of memory. Each integer is up to 2^20, so stored as 4 bytes each. 1e5 * 20 *4 bytes is 8e6 bytes, which is 8MB. So that's acceptable.

But in practice, in Python, list appends are efficient. However, for n=1e5, the code might be tight on memory, but within the 512MB limit.

Another optimization is to note that for each step, the current_basis can be updated in place, but since each step requires a copy for the previous basis, the code as written is correct.

But wait, in the current code, when processing each element, new_basis is a copy of the previous basis (current_basis.copy()). Then, the new element is inserted into new_basis. So current_basis is then set to new_basis, and stored in prefix_bases.

But this is correct because each new element is processed in the context of the previous basis.

Now, what about the pow2 array? The code precomputes up to n, which is 1e5. So the maximum exponent is 1e5, which is correct.

So the code should be correct.

Now, let's test the code for the sample input where x is not in the basis.

For example, the third query in the first sample: 3 7.

The first 3 elements are 0,1,2,3 (wait, no. l=3 refers to the first 3 elements: 0,1,2.

Wait, the first sample's first query is l=4. But the third query is l=3, x=7.

Wait, let's recheck:

The first sample's input:

5 5

0 1 2 3 4.

Queries:

4 3 → output 4.

2 0 → output 2.

3 7 → output 0.

5 7 → output 4.

5 8 → output 0.

For query l=3, x=7.

The first 3 elements are 0,1,2. Their basis after processing:

element 0: 0 → no change.

element 1: 1 → basis becomes [1,0...], r=1.

element 2: 2 → basis becomes [1,2,0...], r=2.

So basis for l=3 is [1,2,0...].

x=7 is 111 in binary. Checking:

x_copy =7.

Check highest bit 2 (since 7 is 111, highest bit is 2 (assuming 0-based)).

But in the basis for l=3, the basis elements are 1 (bit 0), 2 (bit 1). So when processing x=7 (bit 2 set), check basis[2] →0. So return False. So output is 0. Which matches the sample.

So code works.

Another query in first sample: 5 7. l=5, x=7.

The basis for l=5 is [1,2,4,0...], r=3.

x=7. Check:

bits 2 (100), 1 (10), 0 (1) →7 is 111.

Check:

x_copy=7.

i=2: basis[2] is4. 7 >>2 is 1. So x_copy ^=4 →3 (binary 11).

i=1: basis[1] is2. 3 >>1 is 1. So x_copy ^=2 →1.

i=0: basis[0] is1. x_copy ^=1 →0. So returns True. e=5-3=2. 2^2=4. Output 4. Which matches the sample.

So the code is correct.

Thus, the code should handle all test cases correctly.
