<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of possible safe codes that match the given hint. The hint has some rules. So, the first thing I need to do is parse all the conditions properly.

The rules are a bit complex. Let me break them down:

1. If a character is '?', then that position can be any digit (0-9). But there's a catch: the first character of the code can't be zero. So even if the first character is '?', we need to make sure that it's not zero. Wait, the problem statement says that the safe code has no leading zeros. So the first character in the code (regardless of the hint) cannot be zero. Wait, but the input's first character is guaranteed to not be zero. Wait, the input's first character is given as a hint. So the first character of the hint is not zero, but what if the hint's first character is a letter or a '?'. For example, if the first character is 'A', then all 'A's in the hint must be the same digit, and that digit can't be zero if it's the first position. Because the code can't have leading zeros.

So the first position's digit (whatever it is determined to be) must not be zero. So even if it's a letter, like 'A', then the digit assigned to 'A' must not be zero if the first character is 'A'.

That's an important point. So for any letter that appears in the first position, the corresponding digit must be non-zero. Also, if the first character is '?', then it can't be zero. So the first character's possibilities are 9 (digits 1-9) if it's '?', or if it's a letter that's assigned a digit, then that digit must be non-zero.

So the main steps I need to perform are:

- Identify all the groups of letters (A-J) that must be the same digit. Each distinct letter represents a distinct digit. So, for example, if the hint is 'AJA', then all A's must be the same digit, and all J's must be a different digit. But the first character is 'A', so the A's digit must be non-zero.

- Then, for the question marks, each can be any digit, but the first character (if it's a question mark) cannot be zero.

But wait, the question marks are independent of each other unless they are part of a letter group. So for example, a '?' is not part of any group. Each '?' can be replaced by any digit, but the first '?' (if any) must be non-zero.

So the approach would be:

1. Process all letters (A-J) in the hint. Each unique letter represents a variable that must be assigned a unique digit. The count of possible assignments depends on how many letters there are and whether any of them is in the first position.

2. The question marks can be filled with any digits, but if the first character is a '?', then it's 9 possibilities. Then other '?'s can be 10 each.

3. Also, the letters in the first position: if the first character is a letter (say 'A'), then that letter's digit must not be zero. So when calculating the possible assignments for the letters, we have to take that into account.

So the steps in more detail:

First, process the letters in the hint. For each letter, group their positions, and ensure that all same letters are assigned the same digit, and different letters are assigned different digits. So for example, if the letters in the hint are A, B, A, C, then A must be one digit, B another, C another.

The number of possible assignments depends on how many unique letters there are, and whether the first character is a letter. Let's say the letters are a set L. The size of L is K. Then the number of possible assignments is the number of ways to assign K distinct digits (each from 0-9, but with the first character's digit (if it's a letter) being non-zero) multiplied by the possibilities for the question marks.

But how to handle the letters and the first character?

Let me outline the variables:

- letters: a set of all unique letters in the hint. Let's call this set S. Let K be the size of S.

- first_char: the first character of the hint. It can be a letter, a digit, or a '?'. If it's a digit, then the code's first digit is fixed (and non-zero, as per input constraints). If it's a letter, then the assigned digit for that letter must be non-zero. If it's a '?', then the first digit is a digit from 1-9 (9 options).

So the plan is:

Compute the number of valid assignments for the letters, considering that if a letter appears in the first position, then its digit must be non-zero. Then compute the number of possibilities for the question marks, considering that the first '?' (if present as the first character) must be 1-9, others can be 0-9.

Wait, but the question marks are not part of the letters. So the first character can be a '?', which is handled as 9 possibilities, but other '?'s can be 10 each.

So the algorithm steps:

1. Check if the first character is a letter. If yes, then the assigned digit for that letter must be non-zero.

2. Count the number of unique letters. Let K be this number.

3. For the letters, the possible digits are: if the first character is a letter (say 'A'), then 'A' can be 1-9 (9 options), and the rest letters (if any) can be 0-9 except the digits already chosen. If the first character is not a letter (i.e., it's a '?', or a fixed digit), then all letters can be assigned any digits, as long as they are distinct.

Wait, but if the first character is a fixed digit, then the code's first digit is fixed and non-zero (as per input constraints). So that's not a problem. For example, if the first character is '5', then the code's first digit is 5. If it's a letter (like 'A'), then all 'A's in the code must be the same digit, which for the first position must be non-zero.

So when processing the letters:

- If there's a letter that appears in the first position (i.e., the first character is a letter), then that letter's digit must be chosen from 1-9. The other letters can be chosen from 0-9, but all distinct.

So the number of possible assignments for the letters is:

If the first character is a letter (call it L), then:

The possible digits for L are 9 (1-9). The remaining (K-1) letters can be assigned digits from the remaining 9 digits (since they must be distinct from L and each other). The count is 9 * permute(9, K-1).

If the first character is not a letter, then all K letters can be assigned any distinct digits. So the count is permute(10, K), but with an exception if any of the letters is in the first position. Wait, no. Wait, the first character is not a letter. So the letters can be any digits, but they must be distinct. So the number is 10 * 9 * 8 * ... * (10 - K + 1), but only if K letters exist. However, if K is 0, then this part is 1.

But wait, if the first character is a '?', then it's treated as a question mark. So for the letters, their assignment doesn't affect the first character unless the first character is a letter.

So the key is to compute the number of valid permutations for the letters, considering the first character's constraints.

Once the letters' assignments are handled, the question marks can be handled as follows:

For each '?', except if it's the first character, there are 10 possibilities. For the first character being '?', there are 9 possibilities (1-9). But if the first character is a letter (so its digit is already determined to be non-zero) or a fixed digit (non-zero per input), then the question marks in other positions can be handled normally.

Wait, the problem states that the input's first character is not zero. So the first character of the code is not zero. For the code, the first character is determined as follows:

- If the hint's first character is a digit: then code's first character is that digit (which is non-zero per input).

- If it's a letter (like 'A'), then the code's first character is the digit assigned to 'A', which must be non-zero.

- If it's a '?', then the code's first character is a digit 1-9 (9 options).

So the code's first character is always non-zero.

Now, for the question marks:

Each '?' in the hint (except the first character) can be replaced by 0-9. The first character if it is a '?', can be 1-9.

So, the number of possibilities for the question marks is:

If the first character is '?', then 9 * 10^(q-1), where q is the number of '?'s in the entire string. Wait, no: because the first character is a '?', then the first '?' contributes 9 options. The rest '?'s (if any) contribute 10 each.

So for example, if the hint is "?A?", the letters are 'A', and the first character is '?'. Then the code's first character is 9 options. The 'A's must be assigned a digit, which is part of the letters' calculation. Then the last '?' is 10 options. So the letters' possibilities are handled first, then the question marks.

So overall, the total number of valid codes is:

(number of valid assignments for letters) * (number of possibilities for question marks).

So the steps to compute the total are:

1. Collect all unique letters in the hint, S. Let K be the size of S.

2. Check if the first character of the hint is a letter (call it L). If so, then in the letters' assignments, L must be assigned a non-zero digit. So the letters' count is 9 * (9 * 8 * ... (10 - K) choose? )

Wait, more precisely:

If the first character is a letter, then that letter's possible digits are 1-9 (9 options). The remaining (K-1) letters can be any distinct digits from 0-9, excluding the one chosen for the first letter.

So the number of permutations for the letters is 9 * P(9, K-1), where P(n, k) is the number of permutations of k elements from n.

If the first character is not a letter (so either a fixed digit or a '?'), then the letters can be any distinct digits (0-9). So their permutations are P(10, K).

But wait, in that case, the letters can't be in the first position. So their digits can be any digits as long as they are distinct. So for example, even if a letter is present in positions other than the first, their digits can be zero. So the letters' permutations are P(10, K) only if none of them is in the first position. But how do we know that? Because in this case, the first character is not a letter. So the letters are in positions other than the first. So their digits can be zero. So yes, their permutations are P(10, K).

So the letters' count is:

if first character is a letter: 9 * P(9, K-1)

else: P(10, K)

But wait, K could be zero. So when K=0, the letters' count is 1 (since there are no letters to assign).

So once we compute the letters' count, then we need to compute the question marks' possibilities.

For the question marks:

We need to count the number of '?'s in the hint. Let's call this Q.

But the first character could be a '?'. So:

If the first character is a '?', then the first '?' contributes 9 options (digits 1-9), and the remaining (Q-1) '?'s contribute 10 each. So total for question marks is 9 * 10^(Q-1).

If the first character is not a '?', then all Q '?'s contribute 10^Q.

But how to check if the first character is a '?'. So:

count_q = number of '?' in the string

if s[0] == '?', then:

   question_mark_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q -1))

else:

   question_mark_count = 10 ** count_q

But wait, the first character being a '?' is part of the count_q. So for example, if the string starts with '?', then count_q is at least 1. So the code for question marks would be:

if the first character is a '?':

   then the first '?' contributes 9 options, others 10 each.

Else:

   all '?'s contribute 10 options each.

So combining all that:

Total = letters_count * question_mark_count

So the steps are:

1. Check if the hint has any letters. Let S be the set of letters (A-J) in the hint.

2. Compute K = len(S).

3. Check if the first character is a letter. Let first_char = s[0].

   a. if first_char is a letter (A-J):

      - Then letters_count = 9 * (9 choose K-1) * (K-1)!) ?

      Wait, permutations. P(n, k) = n * (n-1) * ... * (n -k + 1). So for the first letter, 9 options (1-9). Then the remaining K-1 letters are chosen from 9 remaining digits (since 0 is allowed for them, but they must be distinct from each other and the first letter's digit).

      So letters_count = 9 * (9 * 8 * ... * (9 - (K-1) + 1 )) )

      Which is 9 * P(9, K-1)

   b. else:

      letters_count = P(10, K)

4. Compute the number of '?'s. Let count_q = s.count('?')

5. Compute question_mark_count:

   if s[0] is '?', then:

      question_mark_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q - 1))

   else:

      question_mark_count = 10 ** count_q

6. Multiply letters_count and question_mark_count to get the total.

But wait, there's a case where the first character is a '?', but the '?' is part of the letters. No, because '?' is not a letter. So letters are only A-J.

So the letters and the question marks are separate.

But also, there's a case where the first character is a digit. Then the code's first digit is fixed (and non-zero, as per input constraints). So in that case, the letters are processed normally (if any), and the question marks (if any) contribute 10^q.

So putting this all together.

Let's test the examples.

First example:

Input: AJ

So the hint is "AJ".

Letters are A and J. K=2.

First character is 'A', which is a letter. So letters_count = 9 * 9 (since for A, 9 options (1-9), then J has 9 options (0-9 excluding A's choice)).

So 9 *9 = 81.

The question marks count is 0. So total is 81 * 1 = 81. Which matches the example.

Second example:

Input: 1?AA

Letters are A. K=1.

First character is '1', which is a digit. So first character is not a letter, so letters_count is P(10, 1) = 10. But wait, letters are A. Since first character is not a letter, the letter A can be any digit (0-9). So 10 options.

But the letters in the code must have the same digit. So in the code, all positions marked A must be the same. So for the letters, there are 10 possible digits (0-9). So letters_count is 10.

Number of '?'s is 1. Since the first character is '1', which is not a '?', the question_mark_count is 10^1 = 10. So total is 10 * 10 = 100. Which matches the example.

Another test case: "?JGJ9"

Letters are J and G. K=2.

First character is '?', which is not a letter. So letters_count is P(10,2) = 10 *9 =90.

The first character is '?', so question_mark_count is 9 * 10^(number of ?s -1). How many ?s are there? Let's see the input is "?JGJ9". The first character is '?', others are J, G, J, 9. So number of ?s is 1. So question_mark_count is 9 *10^(0) =9. So total is 90 *9=810. But the sample input's possible code examples include "51919" which implies that the letters J and G can take different digits. But according to our code's approach, that's handled correctly.

So the approach seems correct.

Now, for the implementation.

But first, considering the constraints. The maximum input size is 1e5. So the code must process this efficiently.

But the processing can be done in O(n) time.

The steps are:

- Check if there are any letters (A-J). For each character in the string, check if it's a letter.

- Collect all unique letters into a set. Let K be the size of the set.

- Check if the first character is a letter. So check s[0] in 'A-J'.

Then compute the letters_count:

if first_char is a letter:

   letters_count = 9 * permute(9, K-1)

else:

   letters_count = permute(10, K)

But how to compute permute(n, k) which is n * (n-1) * ... * (n -k +1).

But K can be up to 10 (since letters are A-J, 10 letters max). So even if K is 10, permute(9, 9) for first case is 9 * 9*8*...*1 = 9 * 9! = but 9 * 9! = 9*362880 = 3,265,920. Which is manageable.

So K can be up to 10. So permutations can be computed in O(K) time.

So, code steps:

1. Read the string s.

2. Collect the set of letters in s (only A-J).

3. Check if the first character is a letter.

4. Compute K = len(letters).

5. Compute letters_count:

   if first_char is a letter:

      if K == 0: impossible (since first_char is a letter but K is 0? No. Because first_char is part of the letters set.)

      letters_count = 9 * (permutation of 9 choose K-1)

   else:

      letters_count = permutation(10 choose K)

6. Compute count_q = number of '?' in s.

7. Compute question_mark_count:

   if first_char is '?':

      if count_q ==0:

         q_count =1 (no, but count_q is zero. So this case can't happen. So in that case, 9^0? Because if count_q is zero, then q_count is 1. But when first_char is '?', but there are no '?', that's impossible. Wait, the first_char is a '?', so count_q is at least 1. So in code:

      if count_q ==0:

          q_count = 1 (but this can't happen if first_char is '?')

      else:

          q_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q -1))

   else:

      q_count = 10 ** count_q

8. The total is letters_count * q_count.

Now, compute permutations.

Implementing permute(n, k):

For example, permute(9, 2) is 9*8=72.

But when K=0, permute(n,0) is 1 (since 0 elements can be arranged in 1 way).

So code for permutations:

def perm(n, k):

    if k ==0:

        return 1

    res = 1

    for i in range(k):

        res *= (n -i)

    return res

But in Python, we can compute this as follows.

So, in the code:

letters = set()

has_first_letter = False

for c in s:

    if 'A' <= c <= 'J':

        letters.add(c)

K = len(letters)

first_char = s[0]

if first_char in letters:

    if K ==0:

        # impossible, since first_char is a letter, but letters is empty. So K can't be zero here.

        # So no need to handle.

    # compute 9 * perm(9, K-1)

    letters_count = 9

    for i in range(K-1):

        letters_count *= (9 - i)

else:

    # compute perm(10, K)

    letters_count = 1

    for i in range(K):

        letters_count *= (10 -i)

Then, count_q = s.count('?')

if s[0] == '?':

    if count_q ==0:

        q_count =1

    else:

        q_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q -1))

else:

    q_count = 10 ** count_q

total = letters_count * q_count

print(total)

But what about the case when letters have K=0, but the first character is a digit or a '?'.

For example, the input is "1". Then letters is empty. So letters_count is 1. count_q is 0. So total is 1 * 1 =1.

Which is correct.

Another example: input is "A". K=1. first_char is 'A'. So letters_count =9.

count_q is 0. So total is 9*1=9.

Which is correct.

But wait, if the input is "A", then all positions must be the same digit (A), which is assigned 1-9. So 9 possibilities. Correct.

Another example: input is "??", then letters is empty. K=0. letters_count is 1.

s[0] is '?', count_q is 2. So q_count is 9 * 10^(1) =90. So total is 90. Correct.

Each code starts with 1-9, then the next is 0-9. So 9*10=90.

Now, implement this in Python.

But how to compute the permutations.

In code:

letters = set()

for c in s:

    if 'A' <= c <= 'J':

        letters.add(c)

K = len(letters)

first_in_letters = s[0] in letters

letters_count = 1

if first_in_letters:

    if K ==0:

        letters_count =0  # impossible case.

    else:

        letters_count = 9  # first letter can be 1-9.

        for i in range(1, K):

            letters_count *= (9 - (i-1))  # 9, then 8, then 7, etc.

            # Because after choosing the first (9 options), the next is 9 remaining digits (since first is chosen), then 8, etc.

else:

    # permute(10, K)

    for i in range(K):

        letters_count *= (10 - i)

But wait, for example, when K is 3 and first_in_letters is false:

permute(10,3) is 10*9*8=720.

So in code:

letters_count =1

for i in range(K):

    letters_count *= (10 -i) if not first_in_letters else (9 if i ==0 else (9 - (i-1)) )

Wait, perhaps code can be written as:

if first_in_letters:

    if K ==0:

        letters_count =1  # but K is 0 implies no letters, which is possible only if first_in_letters is False. So this can't happen.

    else:

        # the first letter (s[0] is a letter) contributes 9 options.

        letters_count =9

        # remaining K-1 letters are chosen from 9 digits (since 10-1=9, as the first's digit is taken from 1-9, and the others must be different)

        # for K-1 letters, it's 9 *8*7 ... (9 - (K-2)) )

        for i in range(1, K):

            letters_count *= (9 - (i-1))

else:

    # all K letters can be chosen from 10 digits, with all distinct.

    letters_count =1

    for i in range(K):

        letters_count *= (10 -i)

So this code should compute letters_count correctly.

Now, for the question marks:

count_q = s.count('?')

if s[0] == '?':

    if count_q ==0:

        q_count =1  # impossible, since s[0] is '?', count_q can't be 0.

    else:

        q_count =9 * (10 ** (count_q -1))

else:

    q_count = 10 ** count_q

So code for q_count:

count_q = s.count('?')

if s[0] == '?':

    q_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q -1)) if count_q else 0

else:

    q_count = 10 ** count_q

But when count_q is 0, and s[0] is '?', then count_q is 0, which implies that there are no '?'. But then the first character is '?', but count_q is 0. This can't happen because if s[0] is '?', then count_q is at least 1. So in code, the case when s[0] is '?' and count_q is 0 is impossible. So the code can safely ignore that.

Thus, the code is:

letters = set()

for c in s:

    if 'A' <= c <= 'J':

        letters.add(c)

K = len(letters)

first_in_letters = s[0] in letters

letters_count = 1

if first_in_letters:

    if K ==0:

        letters_count =0  # impossible.

    else:

        letters_count =9

        for i in range(1, K):

            letters_count *= (9 - (i-1))

else:

    for i in range(K):

        letters_count *= (10 -i)

count_q = s.count('?')

if s[0] == '?':

    q_count =9 * (10 ** (count_q -1))

else:

    q_count = 10 ** count_q

total = letters_count * q_count

print(total)

But wait, when K is zero, letters_count is 1 (since product over 0 elements is 1). So if K is zero, and first_in_letters is False (since K is zero implies no letters, so first character can't be a letter), then letters_count is 1.

So for example, input is "1?", which has no letters. So K=0. letters_count is 1. count_q=1. first_char is '1', not a question mark. So q_count=10^1=10. total is 1*10=10. Which is correct: the code starts with 1, the next is any digit (0-9). So 10 possibilities.

Another example: input is "?AA". The first character is '?', letters are A (K=1). first_in_letters is false (s[0] is '?', not a letter). So letters_count is 10 (permute(10,1) is 10). count_q is 1 (the first character). So q_count is 9 *10^0=9. So total is 10 *9=90.

Wait, but the code would be:

The letters are A. So all A's must be the same digit. The first character is '?', which is not a letter. So the first character is '?', which can be 1-9 (9 options). Then the two A's must be the same digit (from 0-9, 10 options). The third character is A, which is same as the other A's. So total is 9 *10 =90. Which matches the code's calculation.

So code seems correct.

Now, handling large exponents. For count_q up to 1e5, 10^count_q can be a very large number, but since the problem requires output as an integer, we can compute it as a power. But in Python, exponentiation with exponents up to 1e5 is manageable, but 10^1e5 is a 1 followed by 1e5 zeros, which is impossible to compute as an integer (it would be a number with 1e5+1 digits). Wait, but the problem says to output the number of possible codes. So the answer can be up to 9* (9 choose K-1) * 10^q, which for q up to 1e5 would be a very large number. But Python can handle big integers.

But in practice, for K up to 10, 9 * 9*8*...*(9-K+1) is manageable. For q up to 1e5, 10^q is a big number but Python can handle it.

But how to compute 10^q efficiently. For example, 10^1e5 is 1e100000, which is a number with 100001 digits. But since the problem requires outputting the exact value, it's possible to compute it as 10**count_q, but when count_q is 1e5, this is a huge number. However, Python can handle big integers, so the code will work.

So, in code:

letters_count = 1

if first_in_letters:

    if K ==0:

        # impossible, since first_in_letters is True implies that s[0] is in letters, but letters is empty. So K must be >=1.

        letters_count =0  # which would make total zero.

    else:

        letters_count =9

        for i in range(1, K):

            letters_count *= (9 - (i-1))

else:

    for i in range(K):

        letters_count *= (10 -i)

But for K=0, letters_count is 1 (since loop runs 0 times, letters_count remains 1).

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

Now, let's code this.

Sample input 1: 'AJ'

letters = {'A','J'}, K=2.

first_in_letters is True.

letters_count =9 * (9 -0) =9*9=81.

count_q=0.

q_count=0, but s[0] is 'A' (not a '?'), so q_count=0. So total is 81*1=81.

Sample input 2: '1?AA'

letters={'A'}, K=1.

first_in_letters is False (s[0] is '1').

letters_count =10 (10-0) ?

No: for K=1, the loop runs once (i in 0 to 0, since K=1). So letters_count *= (10-0) => 1 *10 =10.

count_q=1 (the '?').

s[0] is not '?', so q_count=10^1=10. total=10*10=100.

Now, code in Python:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    letters = set()
    for c in s:
        if 'A' <= c <= 'J':
            letters.add(c)
    K = len(letters)

    first_in_letters = s[0] in letters if s else False

    letters_count = 1

    if first_in_letters:
        if K == 0:
            letters_count = 0
        else:
            letters_count = 9
            for i in range(1, K):
                letters_count *= (9 - (i-1))
    else:
        for i in range(K):
            letters_count *= (10 - i)

    count_q = s.count('?')

    if s and s[0] == '?':
        q_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q - 1)) if count_q != 0 else 0
    else:
        q_count = 10 ** count_q

    total = letters_count * q_count
    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
1?AA
""",
            "output": \
"""\
100
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 2:

Input: 1?AA

letters = {'A'}

K=1.

first_in_letters is False.

letters_count =10.

count_q=1.

s[0] is '1' not '?', so q_count=10^1=10.

total=10*10=100. Correct.

Another test case: input '?', letters is empty.

K=0.

first_in_letters is False.

letters_count is 1.

count_q=1.

s[0] is '?', so q_count=9*10^(0)=9.

total=1*9=9. Correct (first character is 1-9, no letters, no other characters).

Another test case: input 'A?', letters {'A'}, K=1.

first_in_letters is True.

letters_count is 9.

count_q=1.

s[0] is 'A', not '?'. So q_count=10^1=10.

total=9*10=90.

So code is correct.

Now, handling large exponents. For example, if count_q is 1e5, then 10^count_q is a very big number, but Python handles it.

So the code is correct and efficient.
</think>

```python
s = input().strip()

letters = set()
for c in s:
    if 'A' <= c <= 'J':
        letters.add(c)
K = len(letters)

first_in_letters = len(s) > 0 and s[0] in letters

letters_count = 1
if first_in_letters:
    letters_count = 9
    for i in range(1, K):
        letters_count *= (9 - (i - 1))
else:
    for i in range(K):
        letters_count *= (10 - i)

count_q = s.count('?')

if len(s) > 0 and s[0] == '?':
    q_count = 9 * (10 ** (count_q - 1)) if count_q else 0
else:
    q_count = 10 ** count_q

print(letters_count * q_count)
```
