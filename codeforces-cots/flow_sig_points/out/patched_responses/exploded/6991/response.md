Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

So the problem is about counting the number of pairs (x, y) such that the concatenation of s_x and s_y has an ascent. An ascent is when there's at least one i < j with a_i < a_j in the concatenated sequence. 

Hmm. The key is to determine for each pair of sequences s_x and s_y whether their concatenation has an ascent. But considering all n² pairs is O(n²), which is 1e10 when n is 1e5. That's way too big. So we need a smarter approach.

First, let's think about when s_x + s_y has an ascent. There are a few possibilities:

1. The ascent is entirely within s_x. Then the pair (x,y) will contribute regardless of y. But wait, if s_x already has an ascent, then any concatenation with any y would have an ascent. So all pairs where x is such a sequence would contribute n times (since y can be any of the n sequences). 

2. The ascent is entirely within s_y. But wait, in this case, since the concatenation is s_x followed by s_y, the elements of s_y are after s_x. So if s_y has an ascent internally, then the concatenated sequence will have that ascent. So if s_y has any ascent, then all pairs (x, y) where x is any sequence would contribute. So the count for these would be the number of sequences y that have an ascent, multiplied by n (since x can be any of the n sequences). 

3. The ascent is between an element in s_x and an element in s_y. So there exists some a_i in s_x and a_j in s_y where a_i < a_j. So even if neither s_x nor s_y has an ascent internally, their concatenation could still have an ascent if the maximum element in s_x is less than the minimum element in s_y. Wait, no. Because maybe the s_x's maximum is not the last element. For example, s_x is [3, 1, 4], then its max is 4. But the last element is 4. So if s_y has a first element greater than 4, then yes. But if s_x's maximum is not at the end, then maybe even if the s_y's min is higher than some element in s_x before the end, then the pair would form an ascent. 

Wait, but the concatenation is s_x followed by s_y. So in the concatenated sequence, all elements of s_x come before elements of s_y. So if there exists any element in s_x that is less than any element in s_y, then the pair (x,y) will have an ascent. Because the element from s_x is before the element in s_y, so that's an ascent. So even if s_x's maximum is 10 and s_y's minimum is 5, but in s_x there's an element 3 and in s_y there's 4, then 3 <4 is an ascent. 

Wait, but in that case, even if the max of s_x is higher than the min of s_y, there might still be elements in s_x that are less than some elements in s_y. So the key is: does s_x have any element less than any element in s_y. If yes, then their concatenation has an ascent. 

But this is only if the ascent is between s_x and s_y. But even if s_x has an ascent, or s_y has an ascent, then the concatenated sequence will have an ascent regardless. 

So the total number of pairs (x,y) that have an ascent is equal to:

number of pairs where s_x has an ascent (counted as x's count) multiplied by n (since any y will do) plus number of pairs where s_y has an ascent (counted as y's count) multiplied by n (since any x will do) minus the overlap (because if both s_x and s_y have an ascent, then the pair is counted in both, leading to double-counting. So we need to subtract the pairs where both have ascents) plus the pairs where neither has an ascent, but the concatenation has an ascent between elements of x and y.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let's try to model it properly.

Let me think of the possible cases where s_x + s_y has an ascent:

- Case A: s_x has an ascent. Then any y will make the pair have an ascent. The number of such pairs is A * n, where A is the count of sequences with their own ascent.

- Case B: s_y has an ascent. Then any x will make the pair have an ascent. The number is B * n, where B is the count of sequences with their own ascent. Wait, but this would include pairs where x is in A and y is in B, which are already counted in case A. So if we add A*n and B*n, we are double-counting those pairs where x has an ascent and y has an ascent. So total pairs would be A*n + B*n - A*B (since those pairs are counted twice, but should be counted once). 

But then, there's another case: when neither s_x nor s_y has an ascent, but the concatenation of x and y has an ascent between elements of x and y. Let's call this case C. The total pairs would then be (A * n + B * n - A*B) + C.

So the problem is to compute all these components.

But how to compute C?

So, for the case where neither x nor y has an ascent, but x + y has an ascent because some element in x is less than some element in y.

But how to compute that?

To compute C, we need the number of pairs (x,y) where:

- x does not have an ascent (so x is non-increasing)
- y does not have an ascent (so y is non-increasing)
- there exists an element in x that is less than an element in y.

Wait, because since x is non-increasing, the elements are in non-ascending order. Similarly for y.

So for x, the maximum possible element that is followed by a smaller element is not possible (since x has no ascent). So x is non-increasing. So the elements of x are in non-increasing order. Similarly for y.

But in the concatenation x + y, since x is non-increasing and y is non-increasing, but the last element of x (x's last element) could be less than the first element of y (y's first element). If that's the case, then x + y will have an ascent (because x's last element is followed by y's first element which is larger).

Wait, no. Because x is non-increasing, so all elements in x are >= the next elements. So the last element of x is the minimum of x. Similarly, y is non-increasing, so its first element is the maximum of y. So, if the minimum of x (last element) is less than the maximum of y (first element), then in the concatenation, x's last element is followed by y's first element, which is larger. So that creates an ascent. Otherwise, if x's last element >= y's first element, then since x is non-increasing and y is non-increasing, the concatenation is non-increasing, so no ascent.

Therefore, for pairs (x,y) where x has no ascent and y has no ascent, the concatenation has an ascent if and only if the last element of x is less than the first element of y.

So for case C, the count is the number of pairs (x,y) where x is non-increasing, y is non-increasing, and x's last element < y's first element.

So the total answer is:

A*n + B*n - A*B + C

Wait, but wait. Wait, when x has an ascent (A), then y can be anything (so A*n pairs). Similarly, if y has an ascent (B), then x can be anything (so B*n pairs). But in this case, the pairs where x is in A and y is in B are counted twice. So we subtract A*B to avoid double-counting. Then, for the remaining pairs (those where x is not in A and y is not in B), we check if x's last element is less than y's first element. If so, they contribute 1 to the answer. So those are the C pairs.

Therefore, the formula is:

answer = A * n + B * n - A * B + C.

So the steps to compute this would be:

1. Precompute for each sequence whether it has an ascent (A_count and B_count are same here, since each sequence is either in A or not. So A is the number of sequences with ascent, B is same as A. So the formula can be written as A * n * 2 - A^2 + C. Wait, because A * n (for x in A) plus B * n (for y in B) is A*n + A*n = 2A n. Then subtract A*B, which is A*A, since B=A. So formula becomes 2*A*n - A² + C.

But that's perhaps a misunderstanding. Let me re-express the formula:

Original idea: 

The pairs where x has an ascent: A * n (each x in A, any y)
The pairs where y has an ascent: B * n (each y in B, any x)
But the pairs where x is in A and y is in B are counted in both terms, so we subtract A*B once.

But if B is the same as A (since any sequence that has an ascent is in B as well), then the formula is A*n + A*n - A² = A(2n -A).

Then, the remaining pairs (where x is not in A and y is not in B) are checked for the case C.

So, C is the number of pairs (x,y) where x is not in A, y is not in B, and last element of x < first element of y.

So the problem breaks down into:

- Compute A: number of sequences with their own ascent.

- For sequences without their own ascent (non-increasing), compute their last element (min_x) and first element (max_y). Then, for each such x, count the number of y's where their first element is larger than x's last element.

So the steps are:

1. For each sequence, determine if it has an ascent. Also, for sequences without ascent, compute their first element (max of the sequence, since it's non-increasing) and last element (min of the sequence). Because in a non-increasing sequence, the first element is the maximum, and the last is the minimum.

Wait, because the sequence is non-increasing. So the first element is the maximum, the last is the minimum.

So for each sequence s_i:

- Check if it has an ascent. If yes, add to A.

If no, then compute first element (s_i[0]) and last element (s_i[-1]).

So for non-A sequences, we collect their first and last elements.

Once we have all non-A sequences, we need to compute C: the number of pairs (x,y) among them where x's last element < y's first element.

So how to compute C efficiently?

Suppose there are M non-A sequences. For each x in M, we need to count the number of y in M where y's first element > x's last element.

If M is up to 1e5, then a naive O(M^2) approach is impossible. So we need an O(M log M) approach.

So here's the plan:

Collect all non-A sequences. For each such sequence, note x_last (s_i[-1]) and y_first (s_j[0]).

For all pairs (x,y), the condition is x_last < y_first.

This is equivalent to, for each x, find the number of y where y_first > x_last.

So if we can pre-process all y_first into a sorted array, then for each x's x_last, we can perform a binary search to find how many y_first are greater than x_last.

But since y's first elements are the first elements of non-A sequences (since y must also be non-A), then we can collect all the first elements of the non-A sequences into a sorted list.

So the steps to compute C would be:

- Collect all the first elements of non-A sequences into a list, say Y_first_list.

- Sort Y_first_list.

- For each non-A sequence x, take x_last (x's last element), compute how many elements in Y_first_list are greater than x_last. Sum all these counts. That's C.

Yes, that's the way. So the time for this part is O(M log M) for sorting, and O(M log M) for all binary searches, which is acceptable.

So the overall steps for the solution are:

1. Read all sequences.

2. For each sequence, determine if it has an ascent. Also, for those that don't have an ascent, record their first and last elements.

3. Compute A (number of sequences with ascent).

4. Compute the answer as A * (2 * n - A) + C, where C is the number of pairs (x,y) among non-A sequences where x's last < y's first.

So the formula is:

answer = A * (2 * n - A) + C.

Because:

A * n (x has ascent) + A * n (y has ascent) - A² (overlap) = A * (2n - A).

Then add C.

So that's the formula.

Now, the key is how to compute whether a sequence has an ascent. For a sequence to have an ascent, there must be some i < j with s_i < s_j.

To check this, we can scan the sequence and track the maximum element so far. Wait, no. Because even if a sequence is not non-decreasing, there could be elements that are smaller followed by larger ones. So for example, [3, 1, 4]. The first element is 3, next is 1 (no ascent here), then 4. So 3 <4 (ascent), but the max so far after first element is 3, after second is 3, then third is 4. So perhaps the way to check is to look for any element that is greater than some previous element.

But for a sequence to have an ascent, it's sufficient to find at least one pair i < j where s_i < s_j.

But how to compute this efficiently for each sequence.

The straightforward way is for each sequence, iterate through all elements and check if there's any i where s[i] < s[i+1]. Wait, no. Because that's for consecutive elements. For example, in [1,3,2], there is an ascent (1 <3), even though the next pair is 3>2. But the presence of 1 <3 is sufficient.

So the correct approach is to track the minimum value encountered so far as we iterate through the sequence. If any subsequent element is larger than the current minimum, then there is an ascent.

Alternatively, for each element after the first, if there exists any element before it that is smaller, then there's an ascent.

But how to check that efficiently.

Let's think: for each position j (starting from 1), if there's a position i < j where s_i < s_j, then the sequence has an ascent.

So during the iteration, if we keep track of the minimum element seen so far up to j-1, then for s_j, if the minimum is less than s_j, then there's an ascent.

Wait, no. Because the minimum up to j-1 could be at a position before j-1, but s_j could be larger than that. For example, sequence [5, 3, 4]. The minimum up to index 1 (element 3) is 3. Then at index 2, s_j is 4, which is larger than 3. So that's an ascent (3 <4). So if we track the minimum up to j-1, then for each j, check if s_j is larger than that minimum. If yes, then ascent exists.

But what about other elements between the minimum and j? For example, [5, 3, 4]. The minimum after first two elements is 3. The third element is 4. So the check 4>3 gives an ascent. So this works.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to track the minimum element up to each position. For each position j, if s_j is greater than the minimum in positions 0 to j-1, then there's an ascent. If any such j exists, the sequence has an ascent.

So for a sequence, iterate through each element, track the min_so_far. For each j starting from 0, after the first element:

At each step, after processing element j, we can track the min_so_far as min(min_so_far, s[j]).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.

Wait, min_so_far is the minimum in the elements up to j (current position). So for j starting at 0, min_so_far is s[0]. Then for j=1, min_so_far is min(s[0], s[1]), etc. Then, for each j >=1, we can check if s[j] > min_so_far up to j-1. Wait, no. Because when processing j, the min_so_far up to j-1 is the min before j. So to track this, perhaps we need to track the min before j.

So here's the approach:

Initialize min_so_far as the first element. Then, for each j from 1 to len(seq)-1:

Check if s[j] > any element before it. But checking all elements is O(l²), which is not feasible for sequences up to 1e5 elements. So we need an O(l) approach.

Wait, but for the purpose of checking if there's any i < j with s[i] < s[j], the minimal s[i] up to i=j-1 is the best candidate. Because if s[j] is larger than that min, then there exists such an i. If not, then even the minimal element before j is not smaller than s[j], so no other elements can be.

So the algorithm is:

For a sequence s:

has_ascent = False

current_min = s[0]

for i in 1 to len(s)-1:

    if s[i] > current_min:

        has_ascent = True

        break

    current_min = min(current_min, s[i])

So this loop will check for each element after the first: is there any element before it that is smaller. If yes, then ascent exists.

Wait, let's test this logic.

Test case 1: [5,3,4]. 

current_min starts at 5.

i=1: s[1]=3. 3 is not > current_min (5), so current_min becomes 3.

i=2: s[2]=4. 4>3 (current_min). So ascent is found.

Yes, correct.

Test case 2: [3,1,2]. 

current_min =3.

i=1: s[1]=1 <3. No ascent. current_min becomes 1.

i=2: s[2]=2>1. Ascent found.

Yes.

Test case 3: [1,2,3,4]. 

i=1: 2>1 → ascent. Correct.

Test case 4: [4,3,2,1]. 

No elements after the first are larger than the current_min (4, then 3, etc.). So no ascent. Correct.

Another test case: [0,2,0,2,0] as in the first example. Let's see:

current_min starts at 0.

i=1: 2>0 → ascent. So yes.

So the algorithm correctly finds that the sequence has an ascent.

So this approach works. So for each sequence, we can determine if it has an ascent in O(l) time, where l is the length of the sequence. Which is acceptable, as the total sum of l is 1e5.

So the steps are:

For each sequence:

- Check if length is 1. Then it can't have an ascent. So A is not incremented.

- Else, iterate through the elements, tracking current_min. For each next element, check if it's larger than current_min. If yes, mark as ascent and break. Update current_min as the min between current_min and current element.

So that's manageable.

Once we have A, the number of sequences with ascent, the next step is to collect the first and last elements of the non-A sequences (those without their own ascent).

For each non-A sequence, since they are non-increasing, the first element is the maximum, the last is the minimum.

But wait, since the sequence is non-increasing, the first element is the maximum. The last element is the minimum. Because as you go through the sequence, each element is <= the previous one. So the first is the largest, last is the smallest.

So for a non-A sequence, the first element is s[0], the last element is s[-1].

So for those sequences, we collect s[-1] (x_last) and s[0] (y_first) when used in pair (x,y).

But when x is a non-A sequence, and y is a non-A sequence, then the condition for their concatenation to have an ascent is x_last < y_first.

So for all such x and y (non-A), count the number of pairs where x's last element is less than y's first element.

So the plan is:

Collect all non-A sequences. For each, record x_last (s[-1]) and y_first (s[0]).

But in the pair (x,y), x is the first sequence (non-A), y is the second (non-A). So x's x_last is s_x[-1], y's y_first is s_y[0].

So collect all the y_first values of non-A sequences into a list. Sort this list. Then for each x in non-A sequences, compute how many y's have y_first > x_last. Sum these counts.

So for each x in non-A, x_last is the value. Then in the sorted list of y_first, find the first index where y_first > x_last, and count the number of elements from that index to the end.

This can be done with binary search.

In Python, the bisect module's bisect_right function can be used. For a sorted list, bisect_right returns the insertion point for x in the list, maintaining sorted order. So the number of elements greater than x is len(list) - bisect.bisect_right(list, x).

So:

sorted_y_first = sorted(y_first_list)
for x in non_A_sequences:
    x_last = x.last_element
    count += len(sorted_y_first) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_y_first, x_last)

So this would compute C.

Now, let's think about the steps again.

In code:

Read n.

For each of the n sequences:

Read l_i, followed by the elements.

Check if the sequence has an ascent.

If yes, increment A.

If not, collect (s[0], s[-1]). Also, collect s[0] into a list for Y_first.

Once all sequences are processed:

Compute A * (2n - A) + C.

But to compute C:

If there are M non-A sequences, then collect all their s[0] into a list. Sort this list. For each non-A sequence, take its s[-1] and compute the number of elements in the sorted list that are greater than s[-1].

Sum all these counts.

So code steps:

Read n.

A = 0

non_A_list = []  # list of (last_element, first_element), but for our purposes, in C, we need the first elements of the non-A sequences. Wait, no. Wait, for C, y is a non-A sequence. So y's first element is s_y[0]. So the Y_first_list is [s[0] for each non-A sequence].

Wait, the Y_first_list is the list of s_y[0] for all non-A sequences. Because when x and y are non-A sequences, the y's first element is s_y[0], which is the maximum of y's elements (since y is non-increasing).

So:

non_A_last = []  # list of x's last elements (s_x[-1] for non-A x)
non_A_first = []  # list of y's first elements (s_y[0] for non-A y)

Wait, no. Because for C, we need for x in non-A, the x's last element (s_x[-1]), and for y in non-A, the y's first element (s_y[0]).

But in code, for non-A sequences, during processing, we can collect both s_x[-1] and s_y[0]. But for the list of all non-A sequences, each of them can be represented by their last element (for x) and their first element (for y).

Wait, but for the Y_first_list, it's the list of all non-A sequences' first elements (s_y[0]).

Because when considering y in non-A, their first element is s_y[0]. So the Y_first_list is the list of s_y[0] for all non-A sequences.

So during processing of each non-A sequence, we collect their s[-1] (x's last element) and add their s[0] to Y_first_list.

So in code:

non_A_x_last = []
y_first_list = []

for each sequence:

    if has_ascent:

        A +=1

    else:

        non_A_x_last.append(s[-1])

        y_first_list.append(s[0])

Once all sequences are processed:

Sort y_first_list.

C = 0

for x_last in non_A_x_last:

    # find number of elements in y_first_list > x_last

    pos = bisect.bisect_right(y_first_list, x_last)

    C += len(y_first_list) - pos

Then the answer is A*(2n - A) + C.

Yes.

So this approach should work.

Now, let's test this with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

5

1 1

1 1

1 2

1 4

1 3

So the sequences are:

s1: [1] → no ascent (length 1)

s2: [1] → no ascent

s3: [2] → no ascent (length 1)

s4: [4] → no ascent

s5: [3] → no ascent

Wait, but all sequences are of length 1. So no sequence has an ascent. So A = 0.

Then, C is the number of pairs (x,y) where x's last element (since x is non-A) is 1,1,2,4,3 (for the 5 sequences), and y's first element is 1,1,2,4,3.

Wait, non_A_x_last would be [1,1,2,4,3], y_first_list is [1,1,2,4,3].

Sort y_first_list: [1,1,2,3,4].

For each x_last in non_A_x_last:

x_last=1: find in y_first_list (sorted) how many elements >1.

sorted list is [1,1,2,3,4]. The bisect_right for 1 is 2. len(list) -2 is 3.

x_last=1: 3.

x_last=1: 3.

x_last=2: elements >2 are 3,4 → 2.

x_last=4: elements >4: 0.

x_last=3: elements>3 is 1 (4).

So sum:

3 +3 +2 +0 +1 = 9. Which matches the sample output. So the answer is 0*(2*5-0) +9=9.

Yes. So the code works for the first sample.

Another test case: second sample.

Sample Input 2:

3

4 2 0 2 0

6 9 9 8 8 7 7

1 6

So the sequences:

s1: [2,0,2,0]

Check if it has ascent. Let's see:

i=0: current_min = 2.

i=1: 0 <=2 → current_min becomes 0.

i=2: 2>0 → ascent exists. So s1 has ascent. So A increments by 1.

s2: [9,9,8,8,7,7]. Check for ascent.

current_min starts at 9.

i=1: 9 → not >9. current_min remains 9.

i=2: 8 → not >9. current_min becomes 8.

i=3: 8 → not >8. current_min remains 8.

i=4:7 → not >8. current_min becomes7.

i=5:7 → not >7. So no ascent. So s2 is non-A. So record s2's first element (9) and last element (7).

s3: [6]. No ascent. So record first (6) and last (6).

So A=1.

non_A sequences are s2 and s3.

non_A_x_last = [7,6] (since s2's last element is 7, s3's is 6).

y_first_list = [9,6]. Sorted is [6,9].

C is the sum over each x_last in [7,6], the number of elements in y_first_list greater than x_last.

For x_last=7: elements in y_first_list >7 are 9 → count 1.

For x_last=6: elements >6 are 9 and 6 is not. Sorted list is [6,9]. bisect_right(6) is 1. len(2) -1=1. So 1. So total C=1+1=2.

Then the answer is A*(2*3 -A) + C → 1*(6-1) +2=5+2=7, which matches the sample.

Yes.

So this approach works.

Now, coding this in Python.

Now, let's code:

First, read n.

Then, for each sequence:

Read l_i followed by the elements.

Check if the sequence has an ascent.

For sequences with l_i=1, automatically no ascent.

Else, iterate through elements, track current_min. If any element after the first is greater than current_min, mark as ascent.

For non-A sequences, collect their last element and first element.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import bisect


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    A = 0

    non_A_x_last = []
    y_first_list = []

    for _ in range(n):
        parts = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
        l_i = parts[0]
        s = parts[1:]
        
        if l_i == 1:
            # no ascent possible
            non_A_x_last.append(s[0])
            y_first_list.append(s[0])
            continue
        
        has_ascent = False
        current_min = s[0]
        for num in s[1:]:
            if num > current_min:
                has_ascent = True
                break

Third sample: I'll have to trust the code, but given the approach, it's correct.

So this code should work.

```python
import bisect

n = int(input())
A = 0
non_A_last = []
y_first_list = []

for _ in range(n):
    data = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = data[0]
    s = data[1:]
    
    if l == 1:
        non_A_last.append(s[0])
        y_first_list.append(s[0])
        continue
    
    has_ascent = False
    current_min = s[0]
    for num in s[1:]:
        if num > current_min:
            has_ascent = True
            break
        current_min = min(current_min, num)
    
    if has_ascent:
        A += 1
    else:
        non_A_last.append(s[-1])
        y_first_list.append(s[0])

y_first_list.sort()
C = 0
for x_last in non_A_last:
    pos = bisect.bisect_right(y_first_list, x_last)
    C += len(y_first_list) - pos

print(A * (2 * n - A) + C)
```
