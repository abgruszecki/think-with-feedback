Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about converting a given image into a barcode with certain constraints, and we need to find the minimum number of pixel changes required. The constraints are that each column must be all the same color, and the consecutive same-color columns must form groups with size between x and y, inclusive. Oh right, x can't be larger than y, but that's given.

First, let's understand the problem. Each column in the final image has to be all black or all white. Then, when these columns are grouped into consecutive same-color blocks, each group's size must be at least x and at most y. So, for example, if x is 1 and y is 2, a valid pattern could be like B W B W (each of size 1), but that's allowed. Or B B W W, with each group size 2, which is also okay.

The goal is to find the minimal number of changes to the original image such that these conditions are satisfied.

So the steps needed are:

1. For each column, compute the cost of converting it to all black or all white. The cost is the number of changes needed. For each column, we can precompute these two costs. So for column j, cost_black[j] is the number of '.' in the column (since those would need to be changed to '#'), and cost_white[j] is the number of '#' in the column (since those would be changed to '.').

2. Once we have these costs, the problem reduces to selecting a sequence of colors (black or white) for each column such that consecutive same colors are grouped into runs of length between x and y. We need to find the sequence with the minimal total cost, adhering to the run-length constraints.

This sounds a lot like a dynamic programming problem. The state would need to track the current color and the length of the current run. Because the run can't exceed y, and we can't start a new run unless the previous run was within x to y. Wait, no. Let's think: when you have a run of length k, you can't have it be less than x. So the transitions must ensure that any run that ends has a length between x and y.

So the dynamic programming approach would track the color of the last group and the current run length. For example, the state could be (last_color, current_run_length). Then, for each column, we can decide whether to continue the current run (if possible) or start a new run (if the current run is at least x and we can start a new one of a different color).

Wait, but the runs must be of length exactly between x and y. So whenever we end a run, its length must be within x and y. So each group in the sequence must satisfy x ≤ len ≤ y.

So for the DP state, we can model it as follows:

- The state is (current_color, current_run_length). But when building the sequence up to column j, the current_run_length is the length of the current run. However, this run's length can't exceed y. Because once it reaches y, the next column must start a new run (possibly of the same color if allowed, but that's not possible because then the run would be y+1, which is invalid). Wait, no. Wait, the maximum allowed run is y. So if a run is of length y, the next column must switch to a different color, and the next run starts with length 1. However, if after that, we can switch back. But each run's length must be at least x and at most y.

Wait, no. The run is a group of consecutive columns of the same color. So for example, if x=2, y=3, a group can be of size 2,3. So, the DP needs to track the color of the current group and how long the group is so far. But each group must be between x and y. So when building the DP transitions, whenever we start a new group (possibly after a previous group that ended), the new group's length must be at least 1 and can't exceed y. But wait, the group must eventually reach a length between x and y. So when building the DP, the current run length is the length of the current group. But that group must eventually reach a length between x and y. So if the current run is length k (k <= y), and we can choose to end it (if k >= x) and start a new group. Or continue the same group, but only if k < y.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let's think of the problem as grouping columns into runs where each run is of the same color and has length between x and y. The columns are processed in order. For each column, we can either:

- Add it to the current group (if the color is the same and the group's current length is less than y). Then, the group's length increases by 1. But once the group's length reaches y, the next column must start a new group.

OR

- End the current group (if its length is at least x) and start a new group of the opposite color with length 1. Then, the new group's length is 1, and it's of the opposite color.

But this approach might not capture all possibilities. For example, after ending a group, the next group can be of the same color again, but that's only allowed if the previous group's length was within x and y. Wait, no. Wait, the groups are sequences of same-colored columns. So consecutive groups must alternate colors. Because if two consecutive groups have the same color, they should have been merged into a single group. So the group colors must alternate. So when you end a group of color c and start a new group, it must be of the opposite color. Therefore, the groups alternate between black and white. So when the current group is of color c, the next group must be of the opposite color. So the groups form a sequence like B, W, B, W, etc., each with lengths between x and y.

Wait, no. That's not correct. For example, if x=1 and y=3, you could have a run of B (1), followed by a run of B (1) again if that's allowed. But no, that's not allowed because consecutive runs of the same color would form a single larger run. So the groups must be of alternating colors. So the color of each group is the opposite of the previous one. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as a sequence of groups where each group's color alternates from the previous, and each has a length between x and y.

Ah, that's a crucial insight. So the runs must alternate colors. So after a group of color c, the next group must be of color (1 - c). Therefore, the DP state can track the current color (since the next group's color is fixed), and the current run's length. But since the next group's color is determined, the transitions are constrained.

Wait, but this is only true if the groups are consecutive. So the initial group can be any color, but each subsequent group must alternate. Therefore, the entire barcode is a sequence of runs that alternate between black and white, each of length between x and y.

Wait, that's not possible. For example, suppose x=1 and y=2. The groups could be B (1), then W (1), then B (1), etc. But in this case, each group is allowed. So the groups alternate colors, but their lengths are all 1. So the DP must track the current color and the current run's length. But the run's length can't exceed y, and when the run's length reaches x, we can choose to end it (start a new group of the opposite color) or continue up to y.

So the key is that each group starts with a certain color, and runs for some length between x and y. Then the next group must be the opposite color, again for some length between x and y, and so on.

So, the problem reduces to choosing a sequence of groups (alternating colors) whose total number of columns is exactly m (the original number of columns), and each group has a length in [x, y]. Then, for each group, we select a color (opposite to the previous group) and a length. The sum of all group lengths must be m.

Given that, how do we model the DP?

Let's model the state as (current_color, current_run_length). For each state, we can track the minimal cost up to column j. Let's see:

Wait, but the group's color must alternate. So once a group ends, the next group's color is fixed. So the DP state can track the current color of the last group and the current run's length (for the current group that is being built). Wait, no. Because the current group is part of the sequence. So the state would need to track the color of the current group and how long it has been. For example, after processing k columns, the last group is of color c and has length l, where l is between 1 and y. Because the group can't be longer than y.

So for each position in the columns (from 0 to m-1), and for each possible color (0 or 1, representing black and white), and for each possible current run length (from 1 to y), we track the minimal cost to reach that state.

The transitions would be:

For each state (color, run_length) at column i, when processing column i+1:

- If the current run_length is less than y, we can continue the same group. So the next state would be (color, run_length + 1), and the cost is added for the column i+1 being color.

- If the current run_length is >= x, we can end the current group and start a new group of the opposite color with length 1. The next state would be (opposite_color, 1), and the cost is added for the column i+1 being opposite_color.

But in this model, the new group's length starts at 1, and the new group's color is opposite. So the transitions are:

From (c, l), we can:

1. If l < y: add another column to the current group. So next state is (c, l+1). The cost is the cost of column i+1 being c.

2. If l >= x: end the current group (which has length l >=x and <= y). Then start a new group of opposite color with length 1. The next state is (1 - c, 1). The cost is the cost of column i+1 being (1 - c).

Wait, but for the new group, the run length starts at 1. But in this transition, the new group's length is 1. However, when starting a new group, it's possible that this group's length can be extended up to y. But the transition here is that after ending a group (when l >=x), the next group starts with length 1.

So the DP transitions would involve these two possibilities. However, the second option (starting a new group) is only allowed if the current run_length is >=x and <=y. Because when you end the current group, its length must be between x and y. So the transition from (c, l) can only happen if l >=x and l <= y. But in the DP state, l can be up to y. So in the initial steps, we need to make sure that all groups are properly formed.

Wait, but in the DP state, the current group's length l can be up to y, but when you transition, you can only end the group if l >=x and <= y. Because otherwise, the group is invalid.

So the transitions are:

For each state (c, l) at column i:

Option 1: Continue the current group. This is allowed only if l < y. Then, the next state is (c, l+1), and we add the cost of column i+1 being c.

Option 2: End the current group (if l >=x and <= y) and start a new group of opposite color. The new group starts at column i+1 (so the length is 1). The cost is the cost of column i+1 being (1 - c).

Therefore, in the DP transitions, whenever we have a state (c, l), for each possible transition, we check if the conditions are met.

The initial state is the first column. For the first column, we can choose to start a group of color 0 or 1. The initial run length is 1. So the initial states are (0, 1) and (1, 1), with their respective costs for the first column.

But wait, the group must be at least x in length. Wait, no. Because the group may be continued beyond x. For example, if x is 2, the initial group could have a run length of 1, but in subsequent steps, it's extended to 2. So the group's final length must be between x and y, but during building, the run can be less than x as long as it's eventually extended to at least x before ending.

Wait, no. Because each group's length must be between x and y. So when a group is formed, its length must be between x and y. So when building the group, the transitions must ensure that once the group is ended, its length is within x and y.

But the DP approach is processing each column step by step, and the group is being built incrementally. So the current run length could be less than x (but the group hasn't ended yet), and then in subsequent steps, it can be extended until it reaches a length >=x. Then, when it's >=x, we can choose to end it (if we can start a new group of the opposite color).

So the DP state (c, l) represents that after processing the first i columns, the last group is of color c and has a run length of l. However, l can be up to y. But in order to end the group (i.e., transition to a new color), we must have l >=x. Because the group's length when ended must be between x and y.

So during the DP transitions, when processing column i (0-based?), the group's length can be up to y. But when we end a group, we must have that the current length is >=x.

So for the transitions:

For a state (c, l) at column i, to process column i+1:

- If l < y: we can continue the group to (c, l+1). The cost is added for column i+1 being c.

- If l >= x and l <= y: we can end this group and start a new one of opposite color (1 - c) with length 1. The cost is added for column i+1 being (1 - c).

But in the DP, the group's length can't exceed y. So when l is already y, you can't continue the group. So in that case, you must end it (if l >=x, which it is, since x <= y). So when l == y, the only possible transition is to end the group and start a new one.

So, the DP needs to track, for each column, the possible (color, run_length) states, with run_length ranging from 1 to y.

The base case is for the first column (i=0). The possible states are (c, 1), where c is 0 or 1. The cost is the cost of the first column being c.

Then, for each subsequent column, we process transitions as described.

The answer would be the minimal cost among all possible states after processing all m columns, but only those states where the current run_length is between x and y. Because the last group must be a valid group (length >=x and <=y). So when processing the last column (i = m-1), the state must have a run_length between x and y.

Therefore, the final answer is the minimum of all dp[m-1][c][l] for c in 0,1 and l in x <= l <= y. Wait, no. Because the columns are processed up to m columns (assuming m columns from 0 to m-1). Wait, the total number of columns is m. So after processing m columns (indices 0 to m-1), the state must have a run_length that is between x and y. Because the last group's length must be within the allowed range.

So the DP needs to track the run_length up to y, and for the final state, the run_length must be >=x and <= y. So when the DP is completed, we look for all states (c, l) where l is in [x, y], and take the minimal cost among those.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each column the cost of converting to black or white.

2. Initialize a DP table where dp[i][c][l] represents the minimal cost to process the first i columns, ending with a color c and a run length l.

But since the columns are 0-based (from 0 to m-1), i ranges from 0 to m-1. For each i, c can be 0 or 1, l ranges from 1 to y.

But since m can be up to 1000 and y up to 1000, the DP table could be up to 1000 * 2 * 1000 = 2,000,000 states, which is manageable for 1e6 operations, but we need to process transitions for each state. Let's see: for each of the 2e6 states, we have two possible transitions (if allowed). So overall, the time complexity would be O(m * 2 * y * 2) ) = O(m * 4y). For m=1000 and y=1000, this would be 4,000,000 operations. Which should be acceptable within 2 seconds (since Python can handle about 1e8 operations in a second, but even 4e6 is way under that).

But wait, for each of the m columns, and for each possible state (c, l), we process transitions. So for m=1000, and each state (c, l) where l can be up to 1000, and two possible colors, that's 1000 * 2 * 1000 = 2e6 states. For each of those, processing up to two transitions. So total operations would be 2e6 * 2 = 4e6 per test case. Which is acceptable.

So the steps are:

- Precompute for each column j (0-based?), the cost of converting to black and white.

Then, for the DP:

- Initialize a 2D array (for colors 0 and 1) and run lengths up to y, and initialize them with infinity except for the starting states.

Wait, but for each column i, the DP state depends on the previous column. So perhaps we can use a DP table where for each step, we track the current color and run length, and update the next state.

But in Python, using a 2D array (current color and run length) for each step, and updating the next step's states based on the current step's states.

Alternatively, for each step, we can track the possible (color, run_length) states and their minimal cost.

But to manage space, perhaps using two dictionaries or arrays for the current and next state.

But for efficiency, perhaps using two 2D arrays (previous and current) of size 2 x (y+1) (since run_length can be up to y). Because for each step, the current color can be 0 or 1, and the run length can be up to y. So for each column, the DP can be represented as a 2 x (y+1) array.

So here's the plan:

Initialize a 2D array 'prev_dp' where prev_dp[c][l] represents the minimal cost up to the previous column, ending with color c and run length l.

For each column i (from 0 to m-1):

   create a new 2D array 'current_dp' initialized to infinity.

   for each color c in 0, 1:

       for each possible run length l in prev_dp[c] where prev_dp[c][l] is not infinity:

           if i == 0: this is the first column, so initial run length is 1.

           else:

               for transitions:

                   option 1: continue the same color, if l < y:

                       new_l = l + 1

                       new_cost = prev_dp[c][l] + cost of current column being c.

                       if new_cost < current_dp[c][new_l], update it.

                   option 2: end the current group (if l >= x) and start a new group of opposite color with run length 1:

                       if l >= x and l <= y:

                           new_color = 1 - c

                           new_l = 1

                           new_cost = prev_dp[c][l] + cost of current column being new_color.

                           if new_cost < current_dp[new_color][new_l], update it.

   set prev_dp = current_dp for the next iteration.

Wait, but for each column, when we process transitions, the current column is i. So for the first column (i=0), we need to initialize the prev_dp as the costs for color 0 and 1, with run length 1. Then, for each subsequent column (i=1 to m-1), we process transitions based on the previous state.

So the code could be structured as follows:

Compute for each column the cost_black[j] and cost_white[j].

Initialize prev_dp as a 2x(y+2) array filled with infinity. For the first column (j=0):

   prev_dp[0][1] = cost_black[0]

   prev_dp[1][1] = cost_white[0]

Then, for each j from 1 to m-1:

   initialize current_dp as filled with infinity.

   for c in 0,1:

       for l in 1..y:

           if prev_dp[c][l] is infinity:

               continue

           // Option 1: continue the same color, if l < y

           if l < y:

               new_l = l + 1

               cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if c == 0 else cost_white[j])

               if cost < current_dp[c][new_l]:

                   current_dp[c][new_l] = cost

           // Option 2: end current group (if l >=x) and start new group of opposite color

           if l >= x and l <= y:

               new_color = 1 - c

               new_l = 1

               cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if new_color == 0 else cost_white[j])

               if cost < current_dp[new_color][new_l]:

                   current_dp[new_color][new_l] = cost

   prev_dp = current_dp

After processing all columns, the answer is the minimum of all prev_dp[c][l] where l >=x and l <= y.

Wait, but in the code, for each j from 1 to m-1, the current column is j. For each state (c, l) in the previous step (j-1), we process the transitions.

So, the code steps through each column, and for each possible state (color, run length), transitions to the next possible states.

But in Python, representing the DP as two 2D arrays (current and previous) with size 2x(y+1) is manageable.

But how to handle the initial step (j=0)?

For j=0 (the first column), the possible states are (color=0, l=1) with cost cost_black[0], and (color=1, l=1) with cost cost_white[0].

Then for j=1 (second column), we process transitions from these initial states.

So the code structure would be:

precompute the cost for each column.

initialize prev_dp as all infinity.

prev_dp[0][1] = cost_black[0]

prev_dp[1][1] = cost_white[0]

then for each j in 1..m-1:

   create current_dp as all infinity.

   for each color c in 0,1:

       for each run_length l in 1..y:

           if prev_dp[c][l] is infinity: skip.

           // option 1: continue same color.

           if l < y:

               new_l = l + 1

               cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if c ==0 else cost_white[j])

               if this cost is less than current_dp[c][new_l], update it.

           // option 2: switch color if possible.

           if l >=x and l <=y:

               new_c = 1 - c

               new_l = 1

               cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if new_c ==0 else cost_white[j])

               if cost is less than current_dp[new_c][new_l], update it.

   prev_dp = current_dp.copy() ?

But in Python, handling this with lists would be efficient.

So, the code steps:

First, compute for each column j, cost_black[j] and cost_white[j]. For example, for each column, count the number of '.' (white) and '#' (black) pixels, then cost_black is the number of '.' (since changing them to '#') and cost_white is the number of '#' (changing to '.').

Then, initialize the DP.

Now, considering that in Python, using lists for the DP tables. For each color (0 and 1), and run_length (up to y), we can have a list of size 2, each being a list of size y+2 (since run_length can be up to y).

But for each step, we can have prev_dp and current_dp as 2 lists (for color 0 and 1), each of length y+2 (indices from 0 to y+1, but run_length starts at 1 up to y).

So the code:

INF = float('inf')

n, m, x, y = map(int, input().split())

# Precompute cost_black and cost_white for each column.

cost_black = []
cost_white = []

for _ in range(n):
    row = input().strip()
    for j in range(m):
        if len(cost_black) <= j:
            cost_black.append(0)
            cost_white.append(0)
        if row[j] == '.':
            cost_black[j] += 1  # '.' needs to change to '#', so cost is +1
        else:
            cost_white[j] += 1  # '#' needs to change to '.', so cost is +1

# Now, for each column j, cost_black[j] is the cost to make column j black.

# Initialize DP.

prev_dp = [[INF]*(y+2) for _ in range(2)]  # 0: black, 1: white

# first column (j=0):

prev_dp[0][1] = cost_black[0]
prev_dp[1][1] = cost_white[0]

for j in range(1, m):
    current_dp = [[INF]*(y+2) for _ in range(2)]
    for c in [0, 1]:
        for l in range(1, y+1):
            if prev_dp[c][l] == INF:
                continue
            # Option 1: continue the same color, if possible (l < y)
            if l < y:
                new_l = l + 1
                cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if c ==0 else cost_white[j])
                if cost < current_dp[c][new_l]:
                    current_dp[c][new_l] = cost
            # Option 2: switch to new color, if current run is >=x and <=y
            if x <= l <= y:
                new_c = 1 - c
                new_l = 1
                cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if new_c ==0 else cost_white[j])
                if cost < current_dp[new_c][new_l]:
                    current_dp[new_c][new_l] = cost
    prev_dp = current_dp

# Now, after processing all columns, the answer is the minimum of prev_dp[c][l] where l >=x and <= y.

min_cost = INF
for c in [0, 1]:
    for l in range(x, y+1):
        if prev_dp[c][l] < min_cost:
            min_cost = prev_dp[c][l]

print(min_cost)

Wait, but this code has a problem. For example, in the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

6 5 1 2

##.#.

.###.

###..

#...#

.##.#

###..

The columns are 5 in total. So m=5.

The code processes j from 0 to 4 (since m=5).

After processing j=4 (the last column), the prev_dp contains the states for the last column. Then, the code checks all c (0 and 1) and l between x=1 and y=2. So in this case, the l can be 1 or 2. But the last group's run length must be between 1 and 2. So any state in prev_dp[c][l] where l is in [1, 2] is considered. Because the group can have a run length of 1 (allowed by x=1) or 2 (allowed by y=2). So even if the run is of length 1 (since x=1), that's acceptable.

But wait, the group must have a run length between x and y. So when the code is processing the last column, the group's run length can be l, which must be >=x and <= y.

But in the code, the final step's prev_dp contains all possible run lengths up to y. So when we look for the minimum, we check all l between x and y, inclusive. That's correct.

Now, let's test the first sample input.

In the first sample input, the code should output 11.

The code should compute the cost correctly. Let's see:

Each column's cost_black and cost_white:

For each of the 5 columns:

Column 0 (0-based):

n=6 rows.

Original pixels:

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: '#'

Row 2: '#'

Row 3: '#'

Row 4: '.' 

Row 5: '#'

So in column 0, the number of '.' is 1 (row 4), and '#' is 5.

So cost_black[0] is 1 (number of '.' to change), cost_white[0] is 5 (number of '#' to change).

Similarly, for the other columns.

But how is the code handling the cost_black and cost_white for each column?

In the code:

for _ in range(n):

    row = input().strip()

    for j in range(m):

        if len(cost_black) <= j:

            cost_black.append(0)

            cost_white.append(0)

        if row[j] == '.':

            cost_black[j] += 1  # '.' → black needs to change, so cost_black is +=1

        else:

            cost_white[j] += 1  # '#' → white, cost_white is +=1.

Wait, no. Wait, cost_black[j] is the number of pixels that need to be changed to make column j all black. So for each '.' in the column, we need to change it to '#', which counts as 1 per '.', and '#' stay as is. So cost_black[j] is the number of '.' in column j.

Similarly, cost_white[j] is the number of '#' in column j.

So the code is correct.

In the first column (j=0):

As per the first sample, the first column of the input is:

Each row's first character:

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: '#'

Row 2: '#'

Row 3: '#'

Row 4: '.' 

Row 5: '#'

So, in this column, there are 5 '#' and 1 '.', so cost_black[0] is 1 (changing '.' to '#'), cost_white[0] is 5 (changing all '#' to '.').

So for the first column, the initial DP is:

prev_dp[0][1] = 1 (cost_black[0])

prev_dp[1][1] = 5 (cost_white[0])

Then, processing each subsequent column.

But how does this lead to the correct answer of 11?

Hmm. Let's see.

After processing all columns, the minimal cost would be the sum of choosing the best sequence of groups that meet the constraints.

But the code's approach should find the minimal path through the DP steps.

Now, let's think of the second sample input:

Sample Input 2:

2 5 1 1

#####

.....
So, n=2, m=5, x=1, y=1.

Each column in the input:

Column 0: first row is '#', second is '.' → cost_black[0] is 1 (change '.' to '#'), cost_white[0] is 1 (change '#' to '.').

Column 1: first row '#', second '.' → same.

Columns 0-4 are all like this. So for each column, cost_black and cost_white are both 1.

So total cost for all columns if they are chosen as black: 5*1=5. But wait, no. Wait, the optimal solution in the sample is to alternate colors. For example, .#.#. which for 5 columns would have groups of 1 each. So the cost would be 5*1 (since each column is alternately chosen as black or white, leading to each column being 1 cost).

But the code would compute that.

In the code:

At each column j, when x=1, y=1.

So during the transitions, when the previous run length is 1, which is >=x (1) and <= y (1), then option 2 is possible (switch color).

So for each column after the first, the code would alternate colors.

Let's see.

First column j=0:

prev_dp[0][1] = 1 (cost_black[0] =1)

prev_dp[1][1] =1 (cost_white[0]=1)

j=1:

For each state (c, l) in prev_dp:

For c=0, l=1:

option 1: l < y (1 <1? No). So can't continue.

option 2: l >=x and <=y (1 is in [1,1]). So switch to new color (1) with l=1.

cost = 1 (prev_dp[0][1]) + cost_white[1] (which is 1) → total 2.

Similarly, for c=1, l=1:

switch to color 0, cost 1 +1 =2.

So current_dp for j=1:

current_dp[1][1] = 2 (from c=0, l=1)

current_dp[0][1] = 2 (from c=1, l=1)

j=2:

prev_dp is current_dp from j=1.

For each state (c, l):

c=0, l=1:

option 1: can't continue (l=1 == y=1).

option 2: switch to color 1, cost 2 +1=3.

c=1, l=1:

switch to color 0, cost 2 +1=3.

current_dp after j=2:

[0][1] → 3 (from c=1, l=1)

[1][1] →3 (from c=0, l=1)

Similarly, after j=4 (the last column):

prev_dp for j=4:

current_dp[0][1] → 5 (each step adds 1)

current_dp[1][1] →5.

The minimal cost is 5, which matches the sample output.

So the code works for the second sample.

Now, let's check the first sample.

The code's output for the first sample is 11.

But how does the code compute that?

Well, perhaps the minimal path involves grouping columns into runs of 2 (since y=2) and alternating colors. For example, .##...##... etc., but I'm not sure. However, the code's approach should find the correct path.

So the code seems correct.

Now, possible optimizations:

In the code, for each column j, the cost_black[j] and cost_white[j] can be precomputed. That's already done.

In Python, using lists for the DP tables is efficient. However, for even better performance, perhaps using two arrays that are updated in place, but given that m is up to 1000 and y up to 1000, the code should be efficient enough.

Another possible optimization is to represent the DP tables as two lists of tuples (color, run_length, cost), but the current approach is manageable.

Now, code in Python:

We need to read the input, compute the cost_black and cost_white for each column, then proceed with the DP steps.

Testing the code with the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

6 5 1 2

##.#.

.###.

###..

#...#

.##.#

###..

The columns are 5.

Let's compute the cost_black and cost_white for each column.

Column 0:

Rows:

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: '#'

Row 2: '#'

Row 3: '#'

Row 4: '.' 

Row 5: '#'

So '.' count is 1 → cost_black[0] = 1. '#' count is 5 → cost_white[0] =5.

Column 1:

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: ''

Wait, the rows are:

Wait, the input lines are:

First line after the first:

##.#. → which is 5 characters.

Then .###. → 5.

Then ###.. → 5.

#...# →5.

.##. # →5.

###.. →5.

So for column 1 (index 1, second column):

Row 0: '#' (character 1)

Row 1: '#' (character 1 of .###.)

Row 2: '#' (character 1 of ###..)

Row 3: '.' (character 1 of #...# → indexes are 0-based?)

Wait, the first row is "##.#." → 5 characters. Let's index columns from 0 to 4.

So for column 1 (second character of each row):

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: '#'

Row 2: '#'

Row 3: '.' (third row is "#...#" → index 1 is '.'?

Wait, the third row is "###..", which is 5 characters. So column 1 is '#'.

Row 3 is "#...#": columns 0: '#', 1: '.', 2: '.', 3: '.', 4: '#'

So column 1 of row 3 is '.'.

Row 4 is ".##.#": columns 0 is '.', 1 is '#', 2 is '#', 3 is '.', 4 is '#'.

Row 5 is "###..": columns 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '.', 4: '.'.

So column 1 (index 1) across all rows:

Row 0: '#'

Row 1: '#'

Row 2: '#'

Row 3: '.' 

Row 4: '#'

Row 5: '#'

So '.' count is 1 (row 3) → cost_black[1] =1 (number of '.' to change to '#'). '#' count is 5 → cost_white[1] =5.

Column 2:

Row 0: '.' (third character of "##.#." → index 2 is '.')

Row 1: '#' (third character of .###. → index 2 is '#')

Row 2: '#' (third character of ###.. → '#'

Row 3: '.' (third character of #...# → '.', index 2)

Row 4: '#' → third character of .##.# → '#'

Row 5: '#' → third character of ###.. → '#'

So '.' count is 2 (row 0 and 3) → cost_black[2] =2. '#' count is 4 → cost_white[2] =4.

Column 3:

Row 0: '#' (fourth character of ##.#. is '#')

Row 1: '.' (fourth character of .###. is '.')

Row 2: '.' (fourth character of ###.. → '.')

Row 3: '.' (fourth character of #...# is '.')

Row 4: '.' (fourth character of .##.# is '.')

Row 5: '.' (fourth character of ###.. → '.')

So '.' count is 5 (rows 1-5, except row 0 is '#') → cost_black[3] is 5. '#' count is 1 → cost_white[3] is 1.

Column 4:

Row 0: '.' (fifth character)

Row 1: '.' (fifth character)

Row 2: '.' (fifth character of ###.. → '.')

Row 3: '#'

Row 4: '#'

Row 5: '.' 

So '.' count is 4 (rows 0,1,2,5) → cost_black[4] =4. '#' count is 2 (rows 3,4) → cost_white[4] =2.

So the cost arrays are:

cost_black: [1, 1, 2, 5, 4]

cost_white: [5,5,4,1,2]

Now, the DP steps:

First column (j=0):

prev_dp[0][1] = 1 (cost_black[0])

prev_dp[1][1] =5 (cost_white[0])

j=1 (second column):

process transitions.

For each c and l in prev_dp:

c=0, l=1:

option 1: l < y (y=2), so yes. new_l=2. cost=1 + cost_black[1] (1) → total 2.

option 2: l >=x (x=1) → yes. switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost=1 + cost_white[1] (5) → total 6.

So current_dp[0][2] = 2 (option1), current_dp[1][1] = min(INF, 6) →6.

For c=1, l=1:

option1: l <2 → yes. new_l=2. cost=5 + cost_white[1] (5) → 5+5=10.

option2: l >=1 → yes. switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost=5 + cost_black[1] (1) →6.

So current_dp[1][2] =10, current_dp[0][1] =6.

So after j=1, current_dp is:

c=0:

l=1: 6 (from c=1, l=1 option2)

l=2: 2 (from c=0, l=1 option1)

c=1:

l=1:6 (from c=0, l=1 option2)

l=2:10 (from c=1, l=1 option1)

Now, j=2 (third column):

prev_dp is current_dp from j=1.

For each c and l:

c=0, l=1:

prev_dp[0][1] =6.

option1: l <2 → yes. new_l=2. cost=6 + cost_black[2] (2) →8.

option2: l >=1 → yes. switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost=6 + cost_white[2] (4) →10.

current_dp[0][2] =8 (from option1)

current_dp[1][1] =10 (from option2)

c=0, l=2:

prev_dp[0][2] =2.

option1: l=2 < y=2 → no. cannot continue.

option2: l >=x=1 → yes. switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost=2 + cost_white[2] (4) →6.

current_dp[1][1] is min(10, 6) →6.

c=1, l=1:

prev_dp[1][1] =6.

option1: l <2 → yes. new_l=2. cost=6 + cost_white[2] (4) →10.

option2: switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost=6 + cost_black[2] (2) →8.

current_dp[1][2] =10.

current_dp[0][1] =8.

c=1, l=2:

prev_dp[1][2] =10.

option1: l=2 == y=2 → no.

option2: l >=1 → yes. switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost=10 + cost_black[2] (2) →12.

current_dp[0][1] would compare 8 and 12, so remains 8.

So after j=2:

current_dp for c=0:

l=1: 8 (from c=1, l=1 option2)

l=2: 8 (from c=0, l=1 option1)

c=1:

l=1:6 (from c=0, l=2 option2)

l=2:10 (from c=1, l=1 option1)

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine.

When j=2 (third column), the previous DP is:

For c=0, l=1: 6

c=0, l=2: 2

c=1, l=1:6

c=1, l=2:10

Processing each of these:

For c=0, l=1:

option1: new_l=2. cost 6 + cost_black[2]=2 →8.

option2: switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost 6 + cost_white[2]=4 →10.

So current_dp[0][2] becomes 8, current_dp[1][1] becomes 10.

For c=0, l=2:

option1: l=2 is not less than y=2 → no.

option2: l >=x=1 → yes. switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost 2 + cost_white[2]=4 →6.

So current_dp[1][1] is min(10, 6) →6.

For c=1, l=1:

option1: new_l=2. cost 6 + cost_white[2]=4 →10.

option2: switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost 6 + cost_black[2]=2 →8.

So current_dp[1][2] =10, current_dp[0][1] =8.

For c=1, l=2:

option1: can't continue.

option2: cost 10 + cost_black[2] (2) →12. So current_dp[0][1] is min(8, 12) →8.

So after j=2, the current_dp is:

c=0:

l=1:8 (from c=1, l=1 option2)

l=2:8 (from c=0, l=1 option1)

c=1:

l=1:6 (from c=0, l=2 option2)

l=2:10 (from c=1, l=1 option1)

So when j=3 (fourth column):

prev_dp is current_dp.

For each state:

c=0, l=1:8.

c=0, l=2:8.

c=1, l=1:6.

c=1, l=2:10.

Processing these:

c=0, l=1 (8):

option1: l<2 → yes. new_l=2. cost 8 + cost_black[3] (5) →13.

option2: switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost 8 + cost_white[3] (1) →9.

current_dp[0][2] =13.

current_dp[1][1] =9.

c=0, l=2 (8):

option1: no.

option2: yes. switch to c=1, new_l=1. cost 8 +1 →9.

current_dp[1][1] is min(9,9) →9.

c=1, l=1 (6):

option1: l<2 → yes. new_l=2. cost 6 + cost_white[3] (1) →7.

option2: switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost 6 + cost_black[3] (5) →11.

current_dp[1][2] =7.

current_dp[0][1] =11.

c=1, l=2 (10):

option1: no.

option2: switch to c=0, new_l=1. cost 10 +5 →15. current_dp[0][1] is min(11,15) →11.

So after j=3:

current_dp for c=0:

l=1:11 (from c=1, l=1 option2 and c=1, l=2 option2)

l=2:13 (from c=0, l=1 option1)

c=1:

l=1:9 (from c=0, l=1 and l=2 option2)

l=2:7 (from c=1, l=1 option1)

Now j=4 (fifth column):

prev_dp is the current_dp from j=3.

For each state:

c=0:

l=1:11

l=2:13

c=1:

l=1:9

l=2:7

Processing these:

c=0, l=1 (11):

option1: l<2 → yes. new_l=2. cost 11 + cost_black[4] (4) →15.

option2: switch to c=1. cost 11 + cost_white[4] (2) →13.

current_dp[0][2] =15.

current_dp[1][1] =13.

c=0, l=2 (13):

option1: no.

option2: switch to c=1. cost 13 +2 →15. current_dp[1][1] is min(13,15) →13.

c=1, l=1 (9):

option1: l<2 → yes. new_l=2. cost 9 + cost_white[4] (2) →11.

option2: switch to c=0. cost 9 + cost_black[4] (4) →13.

current_dp[1][2] =11.

current_dp[0][1] =13.

c=1, l=2 (7):

option1: no.

option2: switch to c=0. cost7 +4 →11. current_dp[0][1] is min(13,11) →11.

So after j=4:

current_dp:

c=0:

l=1:11 (from c=1, l=2 option2)

l=2:15 (from c=0, l=1 option1)

c=1:

l=1:13 (from c=0, l=1 and l=2 option2)

l=2:11 (from c=1, l=1 option1)

Now, the minimal cost is the minimum of all prev_dp[c][l] where l is between x=1 and y=2.

Looking at the current_dp:

For c=0:

l=1:11 (valid)

l=2:15 (valid)

For c=1:

l=1:13 (valid)

l=2:11 (valid)

So the minimal is min(11, 15, 13, 11) →11.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code works.

Thus, the code should correctly handle all cases.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to convert an image into a barcode with specific constraints on column colors and group lengths. The goal is to minimize the number of pixel changes required.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Each column must be uniformly black or white.
   - Consecutive columns of the same color must form groups with lengths between `x` and `y` inclusive.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - **State Representation**: Use a DP table where `dp[c][l]` represents the minimum cost to convert the first `i` columns such that the `i-th` column ends with color `c` and a run length of `l`.
   - **Transitions**:
     - **Continue Current Group**: If the current run length is less than `y`, extend the run.
     - **Start New Group**: If the current run length is within `[x, y]`, switch to the opposite color and start a new run of length 1.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - Calculate the cost to convert each column to all black or all white.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1
    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1
    x = int(input[idx]); idx += 1
    y = int(input[idx]); idx += 1
    
    cost_black = [0] * m
    cost_white = [0] * m
    
    for j in range(m):
        cost_black[j] = 0
        cost_white[j] = 0
    
    for _ in range(n):
        row = input[idx]; idx += 1
        for j in range(m):
            if row[j] == '.':
                cost_black[j] += 1
            else:
                cost_white[j] += 1
    
    INF = float('inf')
    prev_dp = [[INF] * (y + 2) for _ in range(2)]
    prev_dp[0][1] = cost_black[0]
    prev_dp[1][1] = cost_white[0]
    
    for j in range(1, m):
        current_dp = [[INF] * (y + 2) for _ in range(2)]
        for c in [0, 1]:
            for l in range(1, y + 1):
                if prev_dp[c][l] == INF:
                    continue
                if l < y:
                    new_cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if c == 0 else cost_white[j])
                    if new_cost < current_dp[c][l + 1]:
                        current_dp[c][l + 1] = new_cost
                if x <= l <= y:
                    new_c = 1 - c
                    new_cost = prev_dp[c][l] + (cost_black[j] if new_c == 0 else cost_white[j])
                    if new_cost < current_dp[new_c][1]:
                        current_dp[new_c][1] = new_cost
        prev_dp = current_dp
    
    min_cost = INF
    for c in [0, 1]:
        for l in range(x, y + 1):
            if prev_dp[c][l] < min_cost:
                min_cost = prev_dp[c][l]
    print(min_cost)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the dimensions and constraints.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each column, compute the cost to convert it to all black or all white.
3. **DP Initialization**: Initialize the DP table for the first column with the respective costs.
4. **DP Transitions**: For each subsequent column, update the DP table by either extending the current group or starting a new group, ensuring constraints are met.
5. **Result Extraction**: The minimum cost is determined from valid end states after processing all columns.

This approach efficiently computes the minimal number of changes needed using dynamic programming, ensuring the constraints are met while optimizing both time and space complexity.
