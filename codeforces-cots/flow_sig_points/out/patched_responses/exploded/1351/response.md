Okay, I need to find an integer s such that B(x) ≡ A(x + s) mod 1e9+7 for all x. The problem gives me the values of A and B at x=0,1,...,d. Let's think about how polynomials behave here.

First, since A and B are similar, there's some s that shifts A to get B. So B is a shifted version of A. How do their coefficients relate? For example, the leading coefficients of A and B should be the same because the leading term of A(x+s) would be a_d (x+s)^d. When expanded, the x^d term is a_d x^d, so the leading coefficients of B must be equal to a_d. But the problem statement says that the leading coefficients are non-zero modulo the modulus, so maybe that's a clue.

Wait, but the problem states that A and B are similar, so their leading coefficients must be the same. But the problem says that the leading coefficients are not divisible by the modulus. So the leading coefficients of B and A must be the same. That's an important point.

So maybe I can find s by looking at the differences in the values of B and A. Let's think about how the polynomials are evaluated. The key is that B(x) = A(x+s) mod MOD. So for each x in 0, 1, ..., d, B(x) = A(x+s) mod MOD.

But how do I compute s from these values? The challenge is that s is an integer, and we need to find it efficiently even for large d (up to 2.5e6).

Hmm. Let's consider the case where d is 1. Then A is linear: A(x) = a0 + a1 x. Then B(x) = A(x+s) = a0 + a1 (x+s) = (a0 + a1 s) + a1 x. So B(x) is also linear. Comparing the coefficients of x in B and A gives that a1 (the leading coefficient) must be the same. Then the constant term of B is a0 + a1 s. So s can be computed as (B(0) - A(0)) / a1 mod MOD. But wait, since the modulus is a prime (since 1e9+7 is prime?), division here would be multiplying by the modular inverse of a1.

But in the first sample input, d=1. The values for A are 1000000006 (which is -1 mod 1e9+7) and 0. So A(x) is 0x + (-1), but wait, that would be a0=-1, a1=0. But that's not possible because the leading coefficient (a1) can't be zero. Wait, the sample input says the leading coefficient is not zero. Wait, in the first example, the problem statement says that A(x) is x-1. Oh right, because the first input line for A is 0: A(0) is -1 mod 1e9+7, and A(1) is 0. So when x=0, A(0) is -1, which is 1e9+6 mod 1e9+7. So the polynomial here is x-1, so a0 = -1, a1=1. Then B(x) is x+2, as in the note. So s is 3, because when you add 3 to x, x+3-1 = x+2.

So for linear case, s is (B(0) - A(0)) / a1 mod MOD. But a1 here is the leading coefficient of A. But how to compute a1 from the values of A? For a polynomial of degree d=1, the leading coefficient a1 is equal to A(1) - A(0), since A(1) = a0 + a1*1, A(0) = a0. So a1 is A(1) - A(0).

Wait, but for a general polynomial of degree d, the leading coefficient can be found using finite differences. Because when you take the (d)th finite difference, you get a value that is d! times a_d. So for a polynomial of degree d, the (d)th finite difference is constant and equal to d! * a_d.

So for example, for d=1, the first finite difference is A(1) - A(0) = a1 (since a1 is the leading coefficient). For d=2, the second finite difference is 2! a_2, which is a_2*2.

So, for both A and B polynomials, their d-th finite differences are d! * a_d and d! * b_d, respectively. But since the leading coefficients a_d and b_d are the same (since the polynomials are similar), then their d-th finite differences must be equal.

Wait, no. Wait, if B(x) = A(x + s), then the leading coefficient of B is a_d (since the leading term of A(x+s) is a_d (x+s)^d, and expanding gives a_d x^d plus lower terms, so leading coefficient is a_d). So the leading coefficients of B and A must be the same, so the d-th finite differences for both A and B must be the same. Because the d-th finite difference is d! * a_d. So for both A and B, their d-th finite differences will be the same.

So for the problem, the leading coefficients of A and B are the same. So the d-th finite difference for A and B is d! * a_d mod MOD.

But how does this help us find s?

Let's think about the (d-1)th finite difference. For a polynomial of degree d, the (d)th finite difference is d! a_d. The (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function, since the (d-1)th differences of a d-degree poly are a linear function (since each finite difference reduces the degree by one). So the first finite difference of the (d-1)th differences would be the (d)th difference, which is constant.

But perhaps there's a way to model how the finite differences of B relate to those of A shifted by s.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the fact that B(x) = A(x+s) mod MOD.

Let’s consider the d-th finite difference for B. Since B(x) = A(x+s), then the d-th finite difference of B is the same as that of A, as discussed.

But for the (d-1)th finite differences, which are linear functions, B's (d-1)th finite difference is A's (d-1)th finite difference evaluated at x+s.

Wait, let's think recursively. For a polynomial P(x) of degree d, the first finite difference is P(x+1) - P(x), which is a polynomial of degree d-1. The leading coefficient of this finite difference is d * a_d. Then, the (d)th finite difference is d! * a_d.

So, for B(x) = A(x+s), the first finite difference of B is B(x+1) - B(x) = A(x+s+1) - A(x+s). Which is exactly the first finite difference of A evaluated at x+s. So the first finite difference of B is the same as the first finite difference of A shifted by s.

Similarly, the (d-1)th finite difference of B is the (d-1)th finite difference of A shifted by s. Because each time we take finite differences, we're essentially looking at the same process but shifted.

So the (d-1)th finite difference of B is a linear function (since the (d-1)th difference of a d-degree polynomial is a linear function). Let's denote that as (d-1)! a_d (x + s) + c, where c is some constant. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

The (d-1)th finite difference of A is a linear function, which can be written as k_A x + m_A, where k_A is the coefficient (d! a_d) divided by d choose something? Wait, no. Let's think: The (d)th finite difference is d! a_d, a constant. So the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function. Let’s denote that function for A as F_{d-1}^A (x) = m_A x + b_A. Then, for B, since each finite difference is shifted by s, the (d-1)th finite difference of B is F_{d-1}^A (x + s). So F_{d-1}^B (x) = m_A (x + s) + b_A. 

The (d-1)th finite difference of B is a linear function. The leading coefficient (slope) is m_A, which is the same as for A, but the intercept term is m_A s + b_A. 

But how can we compute this? Let's see. The (d-1)th finite difference for A can be computed from the values of A. Similarly for B. Then, the (d-1)th finite difference of B is equal to the (d-1)th finite difference of A shifted by s. But since the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function, perhaps the difference between the linear functions of B and A can give us s.

Let me formalize this. Let F_{d-1}^A (x) = m * x + c_A. Then, F_{d-1}^B (x) = m * (x + s) + c_A = m x + (m s + c_A). So the difference between F_{d-1}^B (x) and F_{d-1}^A (x) is m s. Therefore, (F_{d-1}^B (x) - F_{d-1}^A (x)) / m should equal s. But how do I compute this?

Alternatively, the coefficients of the (d-1)th finite difference for B and A can be compared. Let's say for the (d-1)th finite difference of A, we have a linear function m x + c_A. For B, the function is m (x + s) + c_A = m x + (m s + c_A). So the intercept of B's (d-1)th finite difference is c_A + m s. So s = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / m mod MOD.

So m here is the leading coefficient of the (d-1)th finite difference of A, which is equal to the (d)th finite difference of A divided by d. Wait, no. Wait, the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function. The (d)th finite difference is a constant, which is m * 1! (since each step in finite differences reduces the degree by 1). Wait, the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function. The (d)th finite difference is the first finite difference of this linear function, which is a constant equal to the slope of the (d-1)th finite difference. So the slope m of the (d-1)th finite difference is equal to the (d)th finite difference (a constant). So m is equal to d! a_d. 

So, the slope m is equal to the d-th finite difference of A (which is the same as that of B). Let's denote this as delta = d! a_d mod MOD.

So, the intercept for the (d-1)th finite difference of B is (intercept_A) + delta * s.

Therefore, s = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / delta mod MOD.

So to find s, I need to compute the intercepts of the (d-1)th finite differences of A and B, subtract them, and divide by delta (the d-th finite difference of A, which is the same as B's), then mod by MOD.

But how do I compute the intercepts of the (d-1)th finite differences of A and B?

The (d-1)th finite difference for a polynomial P is a linear function. For example, when d=2, the first finite difference is quadratic (since the original is quadratic), but the second finite difference is linear, and the third is constant. Wait, no. Wait, for a quadratic polynomial (d=2), the first finite difference is linear (degree 1), the second finite difference is a constant (degree 0). The (d)th finite difference is a constant.

Wait, the (d)th finite difference of a polynomial of degree d is a constant equal to d! a_d. So for d=2, the second finite difference is 2! a_2.

Wait, but the (d-1)th finite difference for a degree d polynomial is a linear function (since after (d-1) finite differences, we have a first-degree polynomial). So for example, when d=2, the first finite difference (d-1=1) is linear.

So, for a polynomial of degree d, the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function. So to compute the intercept of this function, we can compute two points of the (d-1)th finite difference and then solve for the intercept.

The (d-1)th finite difference for a polynomial P is the function that, when evaluated at x, is the (d-1)th finite difference of P starting at x. For example, for d=2, the first finite difference at x=0 is P(1) - P(0). The first finite difference at x=1 is P(2) - P(1), etc. But when we take the (d-1)th finite difference, we end up with a linear function. So for each x, the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function of x.

But how to compute the intercept of this linear function?

The (d-1)th finite difference can be computed as the sum over the values of P with coefficients from the binomial coefficients. For example, the k-th finite difference at x=0 is the sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^(k-i) * C(k, i) * P(i). Wait, but for the (d-1)th finite difference, the value at x=0 is the sum for the first d terms, but perhaps for our case, we can compute two points of the (d-1)th finite difference function and then find the intercept.

Wait, the (d-1)th finite difference function is linear. So to find its equation, we can compute two points. For example, at x=0 and x=1. Then, the slope is the difference between the two, and the intercept is the value at x=0.

But the (d-1)th finite difference for the polynomial P is a function F(x) such that F(x) is equal to the (d-1)th finite difference of P evaluated at x. So F(0) is the (d-1)th finite difference computed over the first d terms (x=0, 1, ..., d-1), and F(1) is the (d-1)th finite difference computed over x=1, 2, ..., d.

Wait, but in finite differences, the k-th finite difference at x=0 is defined as Delta^k P(0) = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^(k-i) C(k, i) P(i). Then, the next finite difference (x=1) is Delta^k P(1) = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^(k-i) C(k,i) P(i+1).

But the function F(x) = Delta^{d-1} P(x) is a linear function. So to find F(0) and F(1), we can compute the (d-1)th finite difference at x=0 and x=1.

Then, the linear function F(x) has F(0) as the intercept, and F(1) - F(0) as the slope. But the slope is equal to the d-th finite difference, which is delta = d! a_d.

Wait, because F is linear, so slope = F(1) - F(0) = Delta^{d} P(0), which is the (d)th finite difference. Because the (d)th finite difference is the first difference of the (d-1)th finite differences. So Delta^{d} P(0) = F(1) - F(0) = delta.

So for the (d-1)th finite difference of A, which is a linear function F_A(x) = delta * x + c_A, where c_A = F_A(0). Similarly for B, F_B(x) = delta * x + c_B, where c_B = F_B(0).

But F_B(x) = F_A(x + s). Because B is a shifted version of A. So substituting into F_A:

F_B(x) = F_A(x + s) = delta * (x + s) + c_A.

But F_B(x) is also delta * x + c_B.

So setting the two expressions equal:

delta x + c_B = delta x + delta s + c_A.

So c_B = c_A + delta s.

Therefore, s = (c_B - c_A) / delta mod MOD.

So the problem reduces to:

1. Compute delta, which is the d-th finite difference of A (or B, since they are similar).
2. Compute c_A and c_B, which are the intercepts (F_A(0) and F_B(0)) of the (d-1)th finite differences of A and B.
3. Compute s = (c_B - c_A) / delta mod MOD.

So the steps are:

- Compute delta as the d-th finite difference of A.
- Compute c_A as the (d-1)th finite difference of A at x=0.
- Compute c_B as the (d-1)th finite difference of B at x=0.
- s = (c_B - c_A) * inv(delta) mod MOD.

But how to compute the (d-1)th finite difference at x=0 for A and B?

Computing the (k)th finite difference at x=0 for a list of values can be done using a combinatorial approach. For the k-th finite difference, it's the sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^(k-i) * C(k, i) * P(i).

But for k = d-1, and we have d terms (since to compute the (d-1)th finite difference, we need d points). For example, when d=1, the 0th finite difference is just the original values. The 1st finite difference (for d=2) would require two points. Wait, no. For the (d-1)th finite difference, where d is the degree of the polynomial. So for a polynomial of degree d, the (d-1)th finite difference is a linear function, and the (d)th finite difference is a constant.

Wait, when d=2, the (d-1)=1st finite difference is a linear function. To compute the first finite difference at x=0, we take P(1) - P(0). Then the first finite difference at x=1 is P(2) - P(1). The second finite difference is (P(2)-P(1)) - (P(1)-P(0)) = P(2) - 2P(1) + P(0), which is the 2nd finite difference. For d=2, the 2nd finite difference is a constant, which is 2! a_2.

So for the (d-1)th finite difference, for a polynomial of degree d, we need to compute the sum for k = d-1. For example, when d=2, (d-1)=1, and the 1st finite difference at x=0 is P(1) - P(0). Then, the intercept of the linear function (the (d-1)th finite difference) is P(1)-P(0) at x=0.

Wait, but the (d-1)th finite difference function is linear. So when you compute the (d-1)th finite difference at x=0, that's the value of F_A(0). Similarly, F_A(1) is the (d-1)th finite difference computed over x=1, 2, ..., d. Then, the slope is F_A(1) - F_A(0) = delta.

So to compute c_A, which is F_A(0), we need to compute the (d-1)th finite difference of A at x=0.

The same applies to c_B: compute the (d-1)th finite difference of B at x=0.

So the key steps are:

1. Compute delta as the d-th finite difference of A (or B; they are the same).
2. Compute c_A as the (d-1)th finite difference of A at x=0.
3. Compute c_B as the (d-1)th finite difference of B at x=0.
4. Compute s = (c_B - c_A) * inv(delta) mod MOD.

So the problem reduces to efficiently computing these three values.

Now, the question is how to compute the (d-1)th finite difference for A and B at x=0.

Computing the (k)th finite difference for a list of values can be done using dynamic programming with combinatorics. For example, for each level of the finite differences, you can compute the next level by subtracting adjacent terms. But for k up to 2.5e6, this approach would be O(k^2), which is too slow.

But there's a combinatorial formula for the k-th finite difference at x=0. The formula is:

Delta^k P(0) = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^(k-i) * C(k, i) * P(i)

So for the (d-1)th finite difference of A, we need to compute sum_{i=0}^{d-1} (-1)^{(d-1 -i)} * C(d-1, i) * A(i).

But wait, when k = d-1, the sum is from i=0 to i=d-1. Because the (d-1)th finite difference requires d points (0 to d-1). But the input gives us A(0), A(1), ..., A(d). Wait, but the problem states that for the polynomial A, the values are given at x=0, 1, ..., d. So for the (d)th finite difference, which requires d+1 points (0 to d). But for the (d-1)th finite difference, which requires d points (0 to d-1). So in the input, the values for A(0) to A(d) are given, but to compute the (d-1)th finite difference at x=0, we need A(0), A(1), ..., A(d-1).

Wait, but that's correct. Because the (d-1)th finite difference at x=0 is computed using the first d points (x=0 to x=d-1), and each finite difference step reduces the number of points by 1. So for k = d-1, the finite difference is computed over the first d points (0 to d-1). So the formula for Delta^{d-1} A(0) is sum_{i=0}^{d-1} (-1)^{d-1 -i} * C(d-1, i) * A(i).

Similarly, the d-th finite difference is computed using all d+1 points (0 to d). So Delta^d A(0) is sum_{i=0}^d (-1)^{d-i} * C(d, i) * A(i).

So the plan is:

Compute delta as Delta^d A(0) mod MOD.

Compute c_A as Delta^{d-1} A(0) mod MOD.

Compute c_B as Delta^{d-1} B(0) mod MOD.

Then, s = (c_B - c_A) * inv(delta) mod MOD.

But how to compute these sums efficiently?

The main challenge is computing the combination terms C(n, i) and the sign terms (-1)^{n-i} for large n (up to 2.5e6). So for n up to 2.5e6, we need to precompute combinations C(n, i) for i from 0 to n. But computing them modulo 1e9+7.

But precomputing all C(d-1, i) for d up to 2.5e6 would require O(d) memory and O(d^2) time, which is not feasible for d=2.5e6.

But wait, for a given n = d-1, and i ranges from 0 to n. So for each test case, n can be up to 2.5e6. So for each test case, we need to compute C(n, i) for i from 0 to n, which is O(n) time and space. But n can be up to 2.5e6, so for each test case, we can compute the combination numbers C(n, i) on the fly.

But how?

The combination C(n, i) can be computed using a recurrence. For example, C(n, 0) = 1, and C(n, i) = C(n, i-1) * (n - i + 1) / i. But division modulo a prime can be done via modular inverses.

So for each n, we can compute all C(n, i) for i from 0 to n using this approach.

But for each i from 1 to n, C(n, i) = C(n, i-1) * (n - i + 1) / i. The division by i can be handled by multiplying by the modular inverse of i.

But since the modulus is 1e9+7, which is a prime, we can precompute the modular inverses of all numbers up to 2.5e6 once. Then, for each test case, we can compute the combinations for the required n.

So steps for precomputation:

1. Precompute inv = [0] * (max_n +1), where max_n is up to 2.5e6.

But for each test case, the n is up to 2.5e6, so for a single test case, the maximum i needed is 2.5e6. So precomputing inverses up to 2.5e6 would be feasible. But given that the time limit is 4 seconds, and for each test case, we can precompute the inverses needed.

But perhaps it's more efficient to precompute inv for all numbers up to 2.5e6 once. However, given that the code may be called once per test case (assuming multiple test cases?), but according to the problem statement, it's a single test case. Wait, the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. So the code will be run once, so precomputing the inverses up to 2.5e6 is possible.

Alternatively, we can compute the inverses on the fly for each i.

So the plan is:

For a given d:

1. Compute n = d-1 for the (d-1)th finite differences.

   So to compute c_A and c_B, we need to compute sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^(n-i) * C(n, i) * A[i] mod MOD.

   Similarly, the delta is sum_{i=0}^d (-1)^(d-i) * C(d, i) * A[i] mod MOD.

So for each of these sums, we need to compute the combination C(k, i) for k up to 2.5e6, and multiply by (-1)^(k-i) and the value of A[i] or B[i].

So for each sum, the approach is:

- Precompute inv array up to max(k) (2.5e6).

- For each term in the sum, compute the combination C(k, i) with the sign, multiply by the value (A[i] or B[i]), and accumulate the sum modulo MOD.

So how to compute C(k, i) efficiently?

Let's take the example of the delta, which is for k=d. The delta is sum_{i=0}^d (-1)^{d-i} * C(d, i) * A[i].

To compute this sum, for each i from 0 to d:

term = (-1)^(d - i) * C(d, i) * A[i]

Similarly for c_A, which is sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^{n - i} * C(n, i) * A[i], where n = d-1.

So for each of these terms, the combination C(k, i) is needed. How to compute this efficiently?

An efficient way is to compute C(k, i) using a loop from 0 to k, building each term incrementally. For example, C(k, 0) = 1. Then, for i from 1 to k:

C(k, i) = C(k, i-1) * (k - i + 1) / i.

But division by i mod MOD is equivalent to multiplying by inv[i].

So for each k (either d or d-1), and for each i from 0 to k, compute C(k, i) as follows:

- Initialize comb = 1 for i=0.

- For each i from 1 to k:

   comb = comb * (k - i + 1) % MOD

   comb = comb * inv[i] % MOD

So for each i, C(k, i) can be computed incrementally.

But for k up to 2.5e6, and for each test case, this would take O(k) time. For two sums (delta, c_A, c_B), but delta is for k=d and c_A is for k=d-1, and similarly for B. So overall time would be O(d) for each of these steps.

But d can be up to 2.5e6, so each test case would take O(d) time, which is acceptable.

So the steps for the code are:

1. Read d, A's values, B's values.

2. Precompute inv array for 1 up to 2.5e6. But since d can be up to 2.5e6, and the maximum needed inv is for i up to d, we can precompute inv up to d.

   How to precompute inv? Using Fermat's little theorem: inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD).

   But computing inv for each i up to d would take O(d) time, which is feasible for d=2.5e6.

3. For each required sum (delta_A, c_A, c_B):

   a. Determine the k (d for delta, d-1 for c_A and c_B).

   b. Compute the sum of terms (-1)^(k - i) * C(k, i) * val[i], where val[i] is A[i] for delta_A and c_A, and B[i] for c_B.

   So, for example:

   delta_A is sum_{i=0 to d} (-1)^(d-i) * C(d, i) * A[i]

   c_A is sum_{i=0 to d-1} (-1)^(d-1 -i) * C(d-1, i) * A[i]

   c_B is sum_{i=0 to d-1} (-1)^(d-1 -i) * C(d-1, i) * B[i]

   Then compute delta_B in the same way, but according to the problem statement, delta_A and delta_B are equal, but perhaps it's safer to compute delta_A and use that.

4. Once delta, c_A, c_B are computed, compute s = (c_B - c_A) * inv(delta) mod MOD.

So the code will need to compute these sums efficiently.

Now, implementing this:

First, precompute the inv array up to d (since in delta, we need combinations up to d).

But for d up to 2.5e6, precomputing inv from 1 to 2.5e6 is feasible.

So, code steps:

Read d.

Read A as a list of d+1 integers.

Read B as a list of d+1 integers.

MOD = 1e9+7.

precompute inv = [1]*(d+1)

for i in 2 to d:

   inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD)

But wait, the maximum needed inv is for i up to d. For k = d, the combinations C(d, i) require inv up to d.

So precompute inv from 1 to d.

But for i in 1 to d, inv[i] is computed as pow(i, MOD-2, MOD). So for d=2.5e6, this is O(d) time.

Then, compute delta for A:

sum_delta_A = 0

k = d

current_comb = 1  # C(k,0) is 1

sign = (-1)^(k - 0) = (-1)^k.

Wait, for each term in the sum, the sign is (-1)^(k - i). So for i=0: sign is (-1)^k. For i=1: (-1)^(k-1). So the sign alternates as i increases. Or perhaps, when k is even, the sign for i=0 is 1 (since (-1)^(even) is 1), then for i=1, (-1)^(even-1) is -1, etc.

Wait, no. For delta, the sum is over i from 0 to d. The sign is (-1)^(d - i).

So for each i, the exponent is (d - i), which can be even or odd.

Alternatively, for each i, the term is multiplied by (-1)^(d - i), which is equivalent to (-1)^(d) * (-1)^(-i) = (-1)^d * (-1)^i (since (-1)^-i = (-1)^i).

But (-1) raised to (d -i) is equal to (-1)^d multiplied by (-1)^(-i) which is (-1)^d * (-1)^i (since (-1)^-i = 1/(-1)^i = (-1)^i for even exponents).

Alternatively, since (-1)^(d-i) = (-1)^{d} * (-1)^{-i} = (-1)^d * (-1)^i.

So for all terms, the sign can be written as (-1)^d multiplied by (-1)^i.

But this may not help; perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (d -i) and compute the sign accordingly.

But how to compute (-1) raised to (d -i) mod MOD?

But since MOD is an odd prime (1e9+7 is 1000000007, which is prime and odd), -1 mod MOD is MOD-1. So (-1)^n mod MOD is 1 if n is even, MOD-1 if n is odd.

So for each i in 0..k:

   sign = 1 if (k -i) is even else -1 mod MOD.

But (k -i) can be even or odd. So for each i, compute (k -i) % 2.

But (k -i) mod 2 can be computed as (k mod 2) - (i mod 2) mod 2. Alternatively, compute (k -i) as even or odd.

Alternatively, during the loop, we can track the sign for each i.

Alternatively, for each i from 0 to k:

   exponent = k - i

   sign = 1 if exponent is even else -1.

But since we are working mod MOD, -1 is equivalent to MOD-1.

So, in code:

for i in 0 to k:

   if (k - i) % 2 == 0:

      sign = 1

   else:

      sign = MOD - 1

So during the loop, for each i, compute the sign and multiply by the combination and the value.

But for large k (up to 2.5e6), this loop can be slow in Python if not optimized.

But how else can this be optimized?

Alternatively, note that the sign can be computed as (-1)^(k -i) = (-1)^k * (-1)^i. So:

sign = [ (-1)^k ] * [ (-1)^i ]

So for each term, the sign is (-1)^k multiplied by (-1)^i. So (-1)^k can be computed once for the entire sum, and (-1)^i alternates between 1 and -1 as i increases.

But that's equivalent to the previous approach.

So the code for sum delta_A would be:

k = d

current_comb = 1  # C(k, 0) is 1

sum_delta = 0

for i in 0 ... k:

   sign = (-1) ** (k - i)

   term = sign * current_comb * A[i]

   sum_delta = (sum_delta + term) % MOD

   if i < k:

       current_comb = current_comb * (k - i) % MOD

       current_comb = current_comb * inv[i+1] % MOD

But wait, for the combination C(k, i) where i ranges from 0 to k:

C(k, 0) = 1.

C(k, 1) = C(k,0) * (k) / 1.

C(k, 2) = C(k, 1) * (k-1) / 2.

So for each i, current_comb starts at 1 (C(k,0)), and for each step i from 1 to k, current_comb is updated as:

current_comb = current_comb * (k - (i-1)) / i 

But (k - (i-1)) = (k - i + 1), which is (k - i + 1) = (k - (i-1)).

So, for i in 1 to k:

current_comb = current_comb * (k - i + 1) % MOD 

current_comb = current_comb * inv[i] % MOD 

So in code:

precompute inv for 1 to k.

current_comb = 1

sum_delta = 0

for i in range(0, k+1):

    # compute sign as (-1)^(k -i)

    exponent = (k - i) % 2

    sign = 1 if exponent == 0 else -1

    sign_mod = 1 if exponent == 0 else MOD-1

    term = sign_mod * current_comb % MOD

    term = term * A[i] % MOD

    sum_delta = (sum_delta + term) % MOD

    if i < k:

        # update current_comb for i+1

        # current_comb is C(k, i) now. For i+1:

        # C(k, i+1) = C(k, i) * (k - i) / (i+1)

        numerator = (k - i) % MOD

        denominator = inv[i+1]

        current_comb = current_comb * numerator % MOD

        current_comb = current_comb * denominator % MOD

So this loop correctly computes the combination terms and accumulates the sum.

Similarly for the (d-1)th finite differences of A and B.

So the code would look like:

MOD = 10**9 +7

d = int(input())

A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_k = d  # since delta is for k=d, and c_A and c_B are for k=d-1

# Precompute inverses up to max_k
inv = [1] * (max_k + 2)
for i in range(2, max_k +1):
    inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD)

def compute_sum(values, k):
    # Compute sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^(k-i) * C(k, i) * values[i]
    current_comb = 1
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, k+1):
        # compute sign: (-1)^(k-i)
        exponent = (k - i) % 2
        sign_mod = 1 if exponent == 0 else MOD-1
        term = (sign_mod * current_comb) % MOD
        term = (term * values[i]) % MOD
        total = (total + term) % MOD
        if i < k:
            # compute current_comb for i+1
            numerator = (k - i) % MOD
            denominator = inv[i+1]  # since i+1 <=k <=max_k
            current_comb = (current_comb * numerator) % MOD
            current_comb = (current_comb * denominator) % MOD
    return total

delta = compute_sum(A, d)

c_A = compute_sum(A, d-1)
c_B = compute_sum(B, d-1)

# compute s = (c_B - c_A) * inv(delta) mod MOD

delta_inv = pow(delta, MOD-2, MOD)
s = ((c_B - c_A) * delta_inv) % MOD

print(s)

Wait, but what if delta is zero? But according to the problem statement, the leading coefficients of A and B are not divisible by MOD. The leading coefficient a_d is equal to the d-th finite difference divided by d! mod MOD. Since delta is d! a_d mod MOD, then delta = d! a_d mod MOD. Since a_d is not divisible by MOD, and MOD is a prime, d! is not divisible by MOD only if d < MOD. For MOD=1e9+7, d is up to 2.5e6, which is less than MOD. So d! is not divisible by MOD. So delta = d! a_d mod MOD. Since a_d is non-zero mod MOD (problem statement), then delta is non-zero mod MOD. Therefore, delta is invertible. So division is possible.

So this code should handle all cases.

Testing the first example:

Sample input 1:

1

1000000006 0

2 3

d=1.

Compute delta = sum for k=1 (d=1):

i ranges from 0 to 1.

For i=0:

sign = (-1)^(1-0) = -1 → MOD-1.

current_comb is 1.

term = (MOD-1) *1 * A[0] → (1e9+6) * (1) → (1e9+6 * 1) mod MOD.

A[0] is 1e9+6 → which is -1 mod MOD. So term is (MOD-1) * (-1) mod MOD → (-1) * (-1) = 1 mod MOD.

For i=0: term is 1.

For i=1:

sign is (-1)^(1-1) → 0 → 1.

current_comb is C(1,1) = 1.

term = 1 * 1 * A[1] → 1 *0 → 0.

sum_delta = 1 +0=1 mod MOD.

So delta is 1.

c_A is computed for k=d-1=0. So sum is A[0] (since k=0, the sum is (-1)^0 * C(0,0) * A[0] → 1 *1 *A[0] → A[0] mod MOD. Which is 1e9+6 → -1 mod MOD.

c_B is sum for k=0: B[0] → 2 mod MOD.

So delta =1, c_A = -1, c_B = 2.

s = (2 - (-1)) / 1 → 3 → which is correct.

So code works for this case.

Second sample input:

d=2.

A values are 1,4,9 → which is (x+1)^2. Evaluated at x=0 → 1, x=1 →4, x=2 →9.

B values are 100, 121, 144 → (x+10)^2. Evaluated at x=0 →100, x=1 → 121, x=2 →144.

So s is 9.

Compute delta (k=2):

sum is sum_{i=0 to 2} (-1)^(2-i) * C(2,i) * A[i].

C(2,0) =1, sign is (-1)^(2-0) =1. term: 1*1*1=1.

i=0: 1.

i=1: (-1)^(2-1) = (-1)^1 → MOD-1. C(2,1)=2. term: (MOD-1)*2 *4 → (MOD-1)*8 → (8*(MOD-1)) mod MOD. But MOD is big, so (MOD-1) *8 mod MOD is (-8) mod MOD. So term is -8 *4 → -32 mod MOD.

Wait, A[1] is 4. So term is (MOD-1) *2 *4 → (MOD-1)*8 mod MOD → (MOD-1)*8 = (MOD*8 -8) → mod MOD is -8.

So for i=0: 1.

i=1: -8.

i=2: C(2,2)=1. sign is (-1)^(2-2) =1. term:1*1*9=9.

Total sum_delta: 1-8+9=2 mod MOD.

So delta is 2.

But wait, delta is the 2nd finite difference of A. For a quadratic polynomial, the second finite difference is 2. So yes, 2 is correct.

Then, c_A is the sum for k=1 (d-1=1). The first finite difference at x=0.

sum_{i=0 to 1} (-1)^(1-i) * C(1, i) * A[i].

i=0: (-1)^(1-0) = (-1)^1 → MOD-1. C(1,0)=1. term: (MOD-1)*1*1 → MOD-1.

i=1: (-1)^(1-1) =1. C(1,1)=1. term: 1*1*4=4.

Sum: (MOD-1 +4) mod MOD → (4 -1) =3 mod MOD.

c_A=3.

c_B is sum for k=1:

B's values are 100,121,144. So for k=1, sum is:

i=0: (-1)^1 * C(1,0)*B[0] → (MOD-1)*1*100 → -100 mod MOD.

i=1: 1 *1 *121 → 121.

Sum: (121 -100) =21.

So c_B is 21.

delta is 2. delta_inv is 500000004 mod MOD.

s = (21 -3) * inv(2) mod MOD → 18 * 500000004 mod MOD → 9 mod MOD.

Which is correct.

So the code should work.

Now, implement this in Python.

But note that the input lines for A and B may have d+1 elements, which for k=d-1, when computing c_A and c_B, the loop goes up to i=d-1, which is the (d)th element in the list (since indices start at 0). So for example, if d=2, A is [A0, A1, A2]. For k=d-1=1, the loop i ranges from 0 to 1 (A[0], A[1]).

Yes, correct.

Now, considering the code's efficiency. For d=2.5e6, the precompute inv loop runs up to d, which is O(d). Then compute_sum is called four times: delta for A, c_A for A, c_B for B, and delta for B (but problem statement says it's same as A's, but code doesn't compute it). But in the code, compute_sum is called three times: delta (d=2.5e6), c_A (d-1), c_B (d-1). Each compute_sum runs in O(k) steps. So total time is O(3d) → O(7.5e6) steps, which is acceptable.

So the code should work efficiently for the given constraints.

So the code is as written above.
