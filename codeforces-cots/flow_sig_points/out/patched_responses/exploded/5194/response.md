<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The task is to determine if there's a 2x2 square in a 4x4 grid that is all the same color, either initially or after changing at most one cell. So, I have to check all possible 2x2 squares in the grid. For each of these squares, check if they are already all the same. If any of them is, then output YES. If none are, then check if changing a single cell in any of these 2x2 squares would make them all the same. If there's any such possibility, output YES. Otherwise, NO.

So the plan is:

1. Check all existing 2x2 squares. If any are all the same, return YES.
2. If not, check for each possible 2x2 square whether flipping one cell (either from . to # or vice versa) would make it uniform.
3. If any of these checks pass, return YES. Else, return NO.

First, how many 2x2 squares are there in a 4x4 grid? Let's think. The 4x4 grid has 3 rows and 3 columns possible for the top-left corner of a 2x2 square. So 3x3 = 9 possible 2x2 squares.

So for each of these 9 squares, we need to check two possibilities: the original state, and whether flipping any one cell (possibly) in that square can make it uniform.

Wait, but step 1 is to check if any existing 2x2 square is already uniform. So first, loop through all 9 squares and check if all four cells are the same. If yes, then output YES immediately.

If none exist, then for each of the 9 squares, check if changing any one cell in that square would make all four the same. So for each square, check all four cells. For each cell, flip it (from . to # or # to .), then check if all four are now the same. If any of these checks pass, then output YES.

If after checking all possibilities, none work, output NO.

But wait, this approach could be computationally feasible given the small grid size (4x4), even though it's O(9 * 4) checks for the second part. Because 9 squares, each has 4 cells, and for each, check if flipping that cell in the grid makes the entire 2x2 square uniform. But since the grid is small, even with some redundant steps, it's manageable.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think.

For each 2x2 square, the current count of black and white cells is considered. Let's see: for a 2x2 square to become all the same after flipping one cell, the possible scenarios are:

Case 1: All four cells are the same. Then we already pass.

Case 2: Three cells are the same, and one is different. Then flipping the different one will make all four same.

Case 3: Two cells of one color and two of another. Flipping any cell would result in three of one and one of another. So that's not enough.

Case 4: All four cells are different. That's impossible because there are only two colors. Wait, in a 2x2 square, the cells can be in any combination. So possible counts are 0,1,2,3,4 of one color.

So for each 2x2 square, if the number of #s is 4 or 0: already good.

Else, for each square, check if the count is 3 (either 3 #s or 3 .s). Then flipping the one different cell would make it 4. Alternatively, if the count is 1, flipping the three others would require three flips, which isn't allowed. So the only way flipping one cell would work is if the current count is 3 (or 1, but flipping one cell would give 2, which isn't enough). Wait, wait: let's see. For example, if a square has 3 #s and 1 ., flipping the . to # gives 4. So that's good. If a square has 1 # and 3 ., flipping the # to . gives 4, which is good.

So the condition is: for a 2x2 square, if the count of either color is 3 or 4. Then, it's possible to have a uniform square (either already, or after flipping one cell).

Wait, but when the count is 3, then flipping the one different cell gives 4. So for each 2x2 square, if the count of # is 3 or 1, then flipping one cell can make all same. Wait no: 3 #s and 1 .: flipping the . to # gives 4. 1 # and 3 .s: flipping the # to . gives 4. So in either case, count of either 3 or 1 for a particular color.

So for each 2x2 square, if the count of either # or . is 3 or 4, then after flipping (if needed) that square can become uniform.

Wait, but for count 4: no need to flip. So if any square has a count of 4, then we can return YES immediately. For squares with count 3, we can flip the one cell to get to 4. So the overall approach is:

Check all 9 squares. For each square, calculate the counts of # and .. If any of them have 4, return YES. Else, check if any of the squares have either 3 #s or 3 .s. If yes, then return YES. Because in that case, flipping one cell can make the square uniform.

Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Because even if a square has 3 #s, but flipping a . in that square (but that . is not part of the square) wouldn't affect the square. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no. The square is a contiguous 2x2 block. The flip can be any cell in the grid, but when considering a particular 2x2 square, flipping a cell that is part of that square could affect that square's uniformity.

Wait, the problem allows flipping any cell in the entire grid, but then after that flip, the entire grid must have at least one 2x2 square that is uniform. So even if the flip is in a different square, but that leads to another square being uniform, it's acceptable.

Wait, but how to model this? Because the flip could affect multiple squares. For example, flipping a cell in the middle of the grid could affect up to four different 2x2 squares (the ones that include it).

So the approach where we check each possible 2x2 square, see if it's possible to flip any cell (not necessarily in that square) such that after flipping, that square is uniform. But that would complicate things, because flipping a cell outside of the square could affect other squares. But no, flipping a cell outside a particular square doesn't affect the colors of that square.

Wait, the 2x2 squares are determined by their positions. For example, a cell (i,j) can be part of up to four 2x2 squares. For example, in a 4x4 grid, the cell (2,2) is part of the 2x2 squares starting at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So flipping that cell would affect all those four squares.

But our approach needs to check if there exists any flip (of one cell) such that after flipping, any of the 9 squares is completely uniform.

So the correct approach is:

For each cell in the 4x4 grid, flip it (change its color), then check all 9 squares to see if any is uniform. If after any flip, there's a uniform square, then return YES. Otherwise, after checking all possible flips and the original grid, return NO.

But wait, the original grid is also considered. So first, check if any of the 9 squares is already uniform. If yes, then return YES. Otherwise, check for each cell in the grid, flip it, then check all squares again. If any of those flips leads to a uniform square, return YES. If none, return NO.

This seems correct, but computationally expensive?

But the grid is 4x4, so 16 cells. For each cell, we flip it (temporarily, in a copy of the grid) and then check all 9 squares. But how efficient is this?

Each cell flip would require O(1) time, since we can flip the cell and check the 9 squares. But how many checks?

Original grid: check 9 squares.

If none, then for each of the 16 cells:

- Flip that cell (create a modified grid, perhaps in a list of lists, but perhaps we can modify the original, check, then revert?)

Wait, but to avoid creating copies each time, perhaps for each cell (i,j), we can toggle its color (from '.' to '#' or vice versa), then check all 9 squares. Then toggle it back.

This way, no need to create a copy of the grid each time. So the steps would be:

1. Read the grid.

2. Check all 9 squares in the original grid. If any is uniform, output YES.

3. If not, iterate over each cell (i,j):

   a. Toggle grid[i][j].

   b. Check all 9 squares again. If any is uniform, then output YES.

   c. Toggle grid[i][j] back to original.

4. If after all possibilities checked and no uniform square found, output NO.

This approach is O(16 * 9) = 144 operations. Which is acceptable for the time constraints. So even in Python, this would run very quickly.

So the steps in code would be:

- Read the 4x4 grid as a list of lists.

- Function to check if any 2x2 square is uniform.

   For all top-left positions (x, y) in 0 <= x <= 2, 0 <= y <=2 (since a 2x2 square starts at x and y, and ends at x+1, y+1):

      Take the four cells (x,y), (x,y+1), (x+1,y), (x+1,y+1).

      Check if all four are the same. If any of them is, return True.

   Else, return False.

So first, check if the original grid has any such square. If yes, return YES.

Else, for each cell (i,j) in 0<=i<4, 0<=j<4:

   Toggle the cell's color (if it's '#', change to '.', else to '#').

   Check all 9 squares again. If any is uniform, then return YES.

   Toggle the cell back.

If after all cells have been checked and none resulted in a uniform square, return NO.

This approach is correct, and efficient enough.

Now, let's think about possible optimizations.

But given the small size, it's probably not necessary. However, the function to check the squares can be optimized.

Another thing to consider: when flipping a cell, which 2x2 squares are affected? For example, flipping cell (i,j) can only affect the squares that include (i,j). Each cell is part of up to four 2x2 squares. For instance, cell (0,0) is part of the square (0,0). Cell (1,1) is part of four squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So when flipping cell (i,j), instead of checking all 9 squares, we can check only the squares that include (i,j). But how many squares is that?

For cells in the corners (e.g., (0,0)), they are part of one 2x2 square. For edge cells not in the corners (like (0,1)), they are part of two squares. For inner cells (like (1,1)), they are part of four squares.

So, for example, flipping a corner cell (0,0) would only affect the square (0,0). So after flipping, we only need to check that square. If that square is now uniform, then we can return YES.

So instead of checking all 9 squares after each flip, which takes O(9) time, we can check only the squares that include the flipped cell. This reduces the number of checks.

But how many squares need to be checked per flip?

For a cell (i,j), the possible squares that include it are the ones whose top-left corner is (i-1, j-1) up to (i, j), but considering the boundaries.

Wait, the top-left corner of a 2x2 square can be (x,y) where x ranges from 0 to 2, and y ranges from 0 to 2. The square includes cells (x, y), (x, y+1), (x+1, y), (x+1, y+1).

So for a given cell (i,j), what are the possible squares that include it?

The square's top-left (x,y) must satisfy:

x <= i <= x+1

y <= j <= y+1

Which translates to:

x >= i-1 (but x >=0)

x <= i (since x+1 >=i implies x >=i-1, but x can't be more than i)

Similarly, y >= j-1, and y <= j.

But since x and y can be 0,1,2:

So possible x for cell (i,j):

max(0, i-1) <= x <= min(2, i)

Similarly for y.

For example, if cell (i,j) is in row 1, column 1:

x can be max(0, 1-1) =0, up to min(2, 1) =1. So x can be 0 or 1.

Similarly y can be 0 or 1.

So the squares that include (1,1) are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).

So for each cell (i,j), the number of squares to check after flipping is:

number of x in [max(0, i-1), min(2, i)] → that's 1 or 2 values.

Same for y. So total squares to check is (number of x options) * (number of y options). For a cell in the middle (i=1, j=1), x options are 0 and 1 (2 options), same for y. So 2*2=4 squares.

For a corner cell (0,0), x can be 0 (max(0, -1)=0, min(2,0)=0). So x=0. y can be 0. So only one square.

So for each flip, the number of squares to check is between 1 and 4, depending on the cell's position.

So instead of checking all 9 squares each time, we can check the squares that include the flipped cell. This can reduce the number of checks from 9 to up to 4, but perhaps on average 2-3. For 16 cells, that's 16*4=64 checks, which is better than 16*9=144.

But even without this optimization, the code would pass. However, implementing this could make the code a bit faster, but perhaps not necessary. Let's think: in Python, even 144 checks are negligible, but perhaps the code is easier to write without this optimization. Because writing code to compute the relevant squares for each cell might add complexity.

But maybe it's better to proceed with the initial approach: for each flip, check all 9 squares. Because even 16*9=144 checks are manageable.

But when you have to check 9 squares for each of the 16 possible flips, plus the initial check of 9 squares, the total number of square checks is 9 + 16 * 9 = 153. Which is trivial.

But perhaps in code, the way to check all squares is manageable.

So here's the plan:

1. Read the grid as a list of lists. For example, grid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(4)]

2. Function is_okay(grid) that returns True if any of the 9 squares is uniform.

3. Check if is_okay(grid) is True. If yes, print YES.

4. Else, loop through each cell (i, j) in 0..3, 0..3:

   a. Toggle grid[i][j].

   b. Check if is_okay(grid) is True. If yes, print YES and exit.

   c. Toggle grid[i][j] back.

5. After all cells processed, print NO.

This approach is straightforward. The function is_okay can be implemented as:

def is_okay(grid):

    for x in range(3):

        for y in range(3):

            # check square starting at (x,y)

            # get all four cells

            a = grid[x][y]

            b = grid[x][y+1]

            c = grid[x+1][y]

            d = grid[x+1][y+1]

            if a == b == c == d:

                return True

    return False

Wait, but wait: the 4x4 grid is 4 rows and 4 columns. The 2x2 squares are starting at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), etc. Wait, no. Because 4 rows and columns, the starting x and y can be 0,1,2. Because a 2x2 square starting at x=0, y=0 covers rows 0-1 and columns 0-1. Starting at x=2, y=2 covers rows 2-3 and columns 2-3. So yes, x and y range from 0 to 2 inclusive. So the loops are for x in 0..2, y in 0..2. So in code, for x in range(3), same for y.

So the function is correct.

Now, what about the flipping? For example, if the original grid is:

####

.#..

####

....

Then the first check in the original grid would find the top-left square (#### first two rows and first two columns) is all #, so return YES. So the code would output YES.

In the second example:

####

....

####

....

Original grid:

Row 0: ####

Row 1: ....

Row 2: ####

Row 3: ....

Check all 9 squares. Let's see:

Looking at squares:

Top-left square (0,0) to (1,1):

Cells (0,0)='#', (0,1)='#', (1,0)='.', (1,1)='.' → not all same.

Other squares in first row:

(0,1) square: columns 1-2, rows 0-1. Cells (0,1)=#, (0,2)=#, (1,1)=., (1,2)=.. → not same.

(0,2) square: columns 2-3, rows 0-1. Cells (0,2)=#, (0,3)=#, (1,2)=., (1,3)=.. → not same.

Then for x=1, y=0: rows 1-2, columns 0-1. Cells (1,0)=., (1,1)=., (2,0)='#', (2,1)='#' → not same.

Similarly, checking all squares would find none are uniform.

Then, for each possible flip:

For example, flipping cell (0,0) from # to ., then check all squares again.

But after flipping, the original square (0,0) would have cells .### in the first row, but the square (0,0) would be ., #, ., . → which is not uniform. So no.

But maybe flipping another cell. However, in the second example, none of the flips would result in a uniform square, hence output NO.

So the code works.

Now, let's test for a case where flipping a cell outside a square can create a uniform square. For example:

Suppose the grid is:

##..

##..

....

....

Original grid has the top-left square as all #, so returns YES.

Another example:

##..
#.##
##..
....

Then, maybe after flipping a cell in the second row.

But perhaps, the code would find that after flipping a certain cell, a square becomes uniform.

But according to the code, the code checks all squares after each flip, so it will find any possible uniform square.

So the code should be correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

Edge cases:

- All cells are the same. Then the answer is YES.

- All cells except one are the same. So flipping the different cell gives all same. So after flipping, any square would be uniform.

Another case: a square with three same and one different. Flipping the different cell makes it uniform.

So the code correctly handles these cases.

Now, code steps:

Read four lines, each line being a string of four characters.

Store them in a grid, as a list of lists.

Check if the original grid has any uniform 2x2 square. If yes, output YES.

Else, loop through each cell (i, j), flip it, check if any square is uniform. If yes, output YES and exit. Then restore the cell.

If all possibilities are checked and no solution found, output NO.

So the code would be something like:

Read grid as list of lists.

if is_okay(grid):

    print("YES")

else:

    for i in range(4):

        for j in range(4):

            # flip cell (i,j)

            original = grid[i][j]

            grid[i][j] = '#' if original == '.' else '.'

            if is_okay(grid):

                print("YES")

                exit()

            grid[i][j] = original

    print("NO")

But in Python, exit() can be done via return, but in code, to exit early, perhaps using sys.exit. Or, after printing YES, return.

But in code, the code must read from stdin, compute, and write to stdout.

So in Python, after flipping the cell, check if is_okay. If yes, print YES and exit. So code:

import sys

grid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(4)]

def is_okay(g):

    for x in range(3):

        for y in range(3):

            a = g[x][y]

            b = g[x][y+1]

            c = g[x+1][y]

            d = g[x+1][y+1]

            if a == b == c == d:

                return True

    return False

if is_okay(grid):

    print("YES")

    sys.exit()

for i in range(4):

    for j in range(4):

        # flip cell (i,j)

        original = grid[i][j]

        grid[i][j] = '#' if original == '.' else '.' 

        if is_okay(grid):

            print("YES")

            sys.exit()

        grid[i][j] = original

print("NO")

But wait, in Python, when you modify the grid, after flipping and checking, you revert it back. So each iteration of i,j flips the cell, checks, then flips back. So the grid is restored to its original state after each check.

This code should handle all cases.

Testing the first sample input:

Input:

####

.#..

####

....

Original grid:

Row 0: ['#','#','#','#']

Row 1: ['.','#','.', '.']

Row 2: ['#','#','#','#']

Row 3: ['.','.', '.', '.']

Check if any original square is uniform. For example, the square starting at (0,0) has all #s (cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)). Wait:

Row 0, columns 0-1: '#', '#'

Row 1, columns 0-1: '.', '#'

So cells are '#', '#', '.', '#'. These are not all the same. So original check returns false.

Then, the code loops through each cell.

For example, when i=1 (second row), j=0 (first column):

Original cell is '.'. Flip to '#'. The grid becomes:

Row 1, column 0 is now '#'. So the square starting at (0,0) is now:

Row 0, columns 0-1: '#', '#'

Row 1, columns 0-1: '#', '#'

So all four cells are '#', so the square is uniform. Thus, is_okay returns True, so code prints YES.

So the code works for the first sample.

Second sample:

Input:

####

....

####

....

Original grid:

Row 0: ['#','#','#','#']

Row 1: ['.','.','.', '.'] 

Row 2: ['#','#','#','#']

Row 3: ['.','.','.', '.'] 

Check the original squares: none are uniform. Then, for each cell flip.

For example, flipping row 0, column 0 to '.', then check squares. The first square (0,0) would have '.', '#', '.', '.' → not uniform. So no.

But after flipping any cell, no square becomes uniform. Thus, code outputs NO.

So the code handles the samples correctly.

Now, code seems correct.
