Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So the task is to determine the maximum percentage of correct steps Jack can make by adding any number of breaks (X's) to his original sequence. The original sequence can consist of L, R, X. The key is that adding X's can help align his steps with the required left-right-left-right pattern.

First, let's break down the problem. The correct marching order is starting with left, then alternating right and left each step. So the correct sequence is L, R, L, R, etc. Any deviation from this is considered incorrect. But Jack's sequence, with possible X's inserted, is repeated over and over. Each time he follows his modified sequence step by step. However, whenever there's an X, he skips that step (doesn't step), but the rest of the sequence continues. So during an X, the required step (from the sergeant's orders) is still advancing, but Jack doesn't make a step. 

The goal is to modify the original sequence by adding X's (we can't remove any existing characters, only add X's) such that when the sequence is repeated, the maximum possible percentage of steps are correct. And we need to calculate this maximum percentage.

Hmm. Let's think about how Jack's modified sequence works. For each position in the original sequence, we can insert any number of X's (including zero) before or after each character. The modified sequence is then the original sequence with those X's added. Then, when Jack marches, he cycles through this modified sequence. For each step in his sequence, if it's L or R, he must match the expected step (left or right) at that time. If it's X, he skips that step in his sequence, but the expected step (sergeant's order) still progresses.

So, for example, if Jack's modified sequence is L X X R X R, then when he repeats this, the steps are L, X (skip), X (skip), R, X (skip), R, then L, X, X, R, X, R, etc. But the sergeant's steps are L, R, L, R, L, R, L, etc. So each time Jack's step is not X, we check if it matches the current expected step.

The problem requires us to find the maximum percentage of steps that can be correct by inserting X's into the original sequence. So the approach is to model each possible position in the modified sequence and determine whether inserting X's allows us to align as many steps as possible with the required LRLR... pattern.

But how do we model this? Let's consider that the modified sequence is the original sequence with some X's added. Each character in the original sequence can have X's inserted before and after. The total steps in the modified sequence are the original characters plus the X's we add. Wait, but when adding X's, the length of the modified sequence increases, right? Because each X is a step in the sequence. For example, inserting X between L and R would make the sequence L X R, which is length 3. Then when repeated, each cycle is L X R, L X R, etc.

But Jack's steps are processed in the order of the modified sequence, including X's. Each step in the sequence is either a step (L/R) that must match the current expected step, or X which skips that step (the expected step still increments).

So the key is to model the modified sequence as a cyclic sequence of L, R, X. For each position in the modified sequence, when it's executed, the current expected step (whether it's L or R) depends on how many steps have been taken (including X's) before this point.

Wait, no. Because X's count as steps in the sequence but they don't result in a step being made. So, the sergeant's order is L, R, L, R, ... and each time Jack's sequence is processed, each element (whether L, R, or X) corresponds to a step in time. For example:

Time 1: Jack's first element. If it's L, then correct. If X, no step. Then time increments by 1.

Wait, no. The sergeant's steps are in time steps. Each step (regardless of whether Jack makes a step) corresponds to a time. For each time step t, the expected step is L if t is odd, R if even.

Jack's sequence is processed in order. For each element in his sequence (including X), when he processes that element, it corresponds to a time step. If the element is L or R, then he makes a step, which must match the current expected step. If it's X, he doesn't make a step, but the time still increments. So the sequence is played in order, and each element (including X) takes one time step. But during an X, Jack's step is skipped, but the next expected step will be based on the next time step.

So, for example, if Jack's sequence is L X R, then:

Time 1: element L. Expected L. Correct. Time increments to 2.
Time 2: element X. No step. Time increments to 3.
Time 3: element R. Expected L (since 3 is odd). So R is incorrect.
Time 4: element L. Expected R (time 4 is even). Incorrect.
Time 5: element X. No step. Time 6.
Time 6: element R. Expected L (time 6 is even? Wait, no. Wait, time steps are 1,2,3,... For each time t, if t is odd, expected is L, even is R. So time 3 is odd (3%2=1), expected L. So in the sequence L X R, the steps are:

t=1: L (correct)
t=2: X (no step, but t increments to 3)
t=3: R (expected L, incorrect)
t=4: L (next in sequence, but t is 4 (even), expected R)
t=5: X (no step, t becomes 5+1=6)
t=6: R (expected R, correct)
t=7: L (t=7, expected L, correct)
t=8: X (no step, t becomes 9)
t=9: R (expected L, incorrect)
... and so on.

So the correctness depends on how the elements in the modified sequence align with the expected step for their position in the time sequence.

The problem is to insert X's into the original sequence such that when the modified sequence is repeated, the maximum number of steps (L or R) in the sequence are correct (i.e., match the expected step for their time t), divided by the total number of steps (i.e., the number of L and R in the modified sequence). Because X's are not steps, so they don't contribute to the count. Wait, no. Wait, the steps are Jack's actual steps (L or R), so the X's are not steps. So the percentage is (number of correct L/R steps) / (total number of time steps) ?

Wait the problem statement says, "the maximal percentage of time that he can spend marching correctly". So the percentage is (number of correct steps) / (total time steps) * 100. Because each time step (including X's) contributes to the time. For example, if in the first 3 time steps, Jack makes two correct steps and one X, then the correct steps are 2 out of 3, so 66.666...%.

Wait but the note in the example says that in the input LXRR, adding two breaks to get LXXRXR gives a 50% correct. Let's see: the modified sequence is LXXRXR, which has length 6. Let's see how the steps proceed when the sequence is repeated.

Let's look at each time step and the sequence:

The modified sequence is L, X, X, R, X, R. Let's process each time step in order, with the sequence repeating:

t=1: L. Expected L. Correct. So count +=1. Time increases by 1.
t=2: X. No step. Time increases by 1.
t=3: X. No step. Time increases by 1.
t=4: R. Expected R (even). Correct. Count +=1. Time 5.
t=5: X. No step. Time 6.
t=6: R. Expected L (odd). Incorrect. Time 7.
t=7: L. Expected L. Correct. Count +=1. Time 8.
t=8: X. No step. Time 9.
t=9: X. No step. Time 10.
t=10: R. Expected R. Correct. Time 11.
t=11: X. No step. Time 12.
t=12: R. Expected L. Incorrect.
... and so on.

But in the note, the output is 50% correct. Let's count the correct steps over the first 6 time steps (one cycle of the modified sequence):

In the modified sequence LXXRXR (positions 0-5 in the sequence):

t=1: L (correct). Time 1: sequence[0] is L. Correct. Count 1.
t=2: X. Time 2: sequence[1] is X. No step. Time moves to 3.
t=3: X. sequence[2] is X. No step. Time 4.
t=4: R. Expected R (t=4 even). Correct. Count 2.
t=5: X. Time 5: sequence[4] is X. Time 6.
t=6: R. sequence[5] is R. Expected L (t=6 even? Wait t is even when time is even. For t=6, even, expected R. Wait no: t=1 is L (odd), t=2 R (even), t=3 L (odd), t=4 R (even), etc. So for t=4, expected R. t=5 is L (odd). t=6 R (even). So at t=6, R is correct. Wait wait, in the example note, the output is 50% correct. Let me re-examine.

Wait the modified sequence in the example is LXXRXR. So the sequence is L, X, X, R, X, R. Let's see each position in the sequence:

Cycle 1 (times 1-6):
- position 0: L (t=1: correct)
- position 1: X (t=2)
- position 2: X (t=3)
- position 3: R (t=4: correct)
- position 4: X (t=5)
- position 5: R (t=6: expected R, correct)

So in this cycle, 3 correct steps (L, R, R). Wait no. Wait t=6 is even (time 6 is even, expected R). So the R is correct. So in the first cycle, the steps are 3 correct (t1: L correct, t4: R correct, t6: R correct?), but how does the cycle work? Let's walk through each element of the sequence for each cycle.

Wait the sequence is LXXRXR, which has 6 elements. Each element is processed in order, and each element takes one time step. So when the sequence is repeated, the next cycle starts at element 0 again.

Let's process each element of the sequence:

First cycle (times 1-6):

Element 0: L (time 1) → correct (L).
Element 1: X (time 2) → no step. Time is 2.
Element 2: X (time 3) → no step. Time is 3.
Element 3: R (time 4) → correct (R).
Element 4: X (time 5) → no step. Time is 5.
Element 5: R (time 6) → correct (R? Because time 6 is even, expected R. So yes, correct.

So in the first cycle, three correct steps (L, R, R). Wait but that's 3 correct steps out of 6 time steps. But wait, the actual steps made are L, R, R (three steps). So the correct count is 3, total time steps is 6. So 3/6 = 50% which matches the example. So the percentage is correct steps divided by the total time steps, multiplied by 100.

Wait but according to this, in each cycle of 6 time steps, 3 correct steps (assuming the steps are L, R, R). But wait, in the example note, when the sequence is LXXRXR, Jack's steps in the first cycle are L (correct), R (correct), R (incorrect?) Wait wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait let's re-calculate the steps for the modified sequence LXXRXR:

The sequence is [L, X, X, R, X, R]. Let's process each element of the sequence in order, each takes one time step.

Time steps start at 1 and increment by 1 for each element.

For each element in the sequence:

Element 0 (L) → time 1. Expected L (correct). Count +=1.

Element 1 (X) → time 2. No step. Time increments to 3.

Element 2 (X) → time 3. No step. Time increments to 4.

Element 3 (R) → time 4. Expected R (correct). Count +=1. Time increments to 5.

Element 4 (X) → time 5. No step. Time increments to 6.

Element 5 (R) → time 6. Expected R (correct). Count +=1. Time increments to 7.

So after one full cycle (6 elements), we've processed 6 time steps (1-6), and made 3 correct steps (L, R, R). So 3 correct steps in 6 time steps → 50% correct. Which matches the example. So the percentage is (correct_steps) / (total_time_steps) * 100.

So the problem is to find how to insert X's into the original sequence so that when the modified sequence is repeated, the maximum possible percentage of correct steps (correct L or R) over all time steps is achieved.

Now, the challenge is to model this in a way that can be computed efficiently, given that the original sequence can be up to 1e6 characters long.

So, the approach must be O(N) or O(N log N) time.

First, let's think about the possible states that the sequence can be in. Each time we process an element of the modified sequence (original elements plus inserted X's), the next expected step (L or R) depends on the current time step modulo 2.

But since the modified sequence is repeated cyclically, the pattern of expected steps (L, R, L, R, etc.) will cycle through the elements of the modified sequence. For example, if the modified sequence has length K, then the expected step for the i-th element (0-based) in the sequence is L if (current_time) is odd, R otherwise. But current_time for the i-th element in the cycle is t_start + i, where t_start is the time at the start of the cycle. However, the cycle repeats, so after each cycle, the time is K steps further. So the expected step for the i-th element in the sequence is L if (i + t0) is odd, where t0 is the time of the first element of the cycle. Wait, but since the sequence is cyclic, the expected step for each element in the sequence depends on the position in the cycle and the total cycle length. Because when the cycle is repeated, the time steps start again at t0 + K, t0 + 2K, etc.

Alternatively, since the sequence is repeated, the time step for the j-th occurrence of the i-th element in the modified sequence is j*K + i + 1 (assuming 1-based time steps). The parity of this time step determines the expected step.

So for the i-th element in the modified sequence (0-based), the expected step for each occurrence of that element is L if (j*K + i + 1) is odd (i.e., when (j*K + i +1) mod 2 is 1), which is equivalent to (K + i + 1) mod 2 for all j. Wait, no. Because j*K mod 2 depends on K's parity. For example, if K is even, then j*K is even for any j. So (j*K + i + 1) mod 2 = (i + 1 + j*K) mod 2 = (i +1) mod 2. Because j*K is even. So when K is even, the parity of the time steps for each element i is fixed. For example, if K is even, then in each cycle, the parity of the time steps for each position i is the same as (i+1) mod 2. So for even K, each occurrence of element i has expected step L if (i+1) is odd (i is even).

But if K is odd, then j*K mod 2 alternates between even and odd. So the parity of the time step for element i alternates between (i+1) mod 2 and (i+1 +1) mod 2 in each cycle. For example, j=0: (0*K + i+1) mod 2 = (i+1) mod 2. j=1: (K + i +1) mod 2. Since K is odd, K mod 2 is 1. So (i+1 +1) mod 2 = (i+2) mod 2 = i mod 2. So for K odd, each element i's parity alternates between even and odd in each cycle.

This has significant implications. For even K, the expected step for each element in the sequence is fixed. For example, if the modified sequence has even length K, then each element's position in the sequence will always be in a time step of fixed parity. So for each element i, whether the expected step is L or R depends only on i. However, if K is odd, then each element's position will alternate between even and odd parity time steps with each cycle. So for example, element i in a sequence of length 3 (K=3) will have time steps 1,4,7,10, etc. The parity of these times is 1 mod 2=1, 4 mod 2=0, 7 mod 2=1, etc. So the parity alternates.

Therefore, the problem can be split into two cases:

1. Modified sequence length K is even.
   - Each element i's expected step is fixed (L if (i+1) is odd, R otherwise).

2. Modified sequence length K is odd.
   - Each element i's expected step alternates between two possibilities each time the cycle repeats.

But since we can insert X's, the modified sequence's length K can be adjusted. However, inserting X's increases K. For example, inserting an X between two elements increases K by 1. So, how can we model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to choose a modified sequence where the length K is even, because then the expected steps are fixed for each element. This may allow us to maximize the correct steps.

But how?

Let's think of the modified sequence as a cycle of K elements. For each cycle, the steps are processed in order, and the time steps for each cycle are t_cycle_start, t_cycle_start + 1, ..., t_cycle_start + K - 1. Then, the next cycle starts at t_cycle_start + K.

In each cycle, the parity of the time steps for each element in the cycle depends on K's parity.

For example, if K is even, then each element i in the cycle will have time steps with parity (i+1) mod 2. Because when K is even, adding K (even) doesn't change the parity. So in each cycle, element i's time steps are j*K + i + 1, for j >=0. The parity is (j*K + i +1) mod 2. Since K is even, j*K mod 2 is 0. So parity is (i+1) mod 2, same for all j. So each occurrence of element i in the cycle will have the same expected step.

Thus, for even K, the expected step for element i is fixed as L if (i+1) is odd (i even), else R.

In this case, for each element in the cycle (modified sequence), if it's an L or R, and it matches the expected step (fixed for that position), then each occurrence of that element contributes 1 to the correct count. X's contribute 0 (since they don't make a step), but take up a time step.

Thus, for even K, the maximum possible correct percentage is the number of L/R elements in the cycle that match their expected step, multiplied by the number of cycles (which is infinite) divided by the total time steps (also infinite), but simplifies to (correct_elements) / K, since each cycle contributes K time steps and correct_elements correct steps.

So the percentage is (correct_elements / K) * 100.

But for odd K, the situation is different. Each element i in the cycle will have time steps with parity (i+1) mod 2 for even-numbered cycles (0, 2, 4, etc.) and (i+1 + K) mod 2 for odd-numbered cycles (since j increases by 1 each cycle). Wait, perhaps another way: for K odd, j*K mod 2 alternates between 0 and 1. So (j*K + i +1) mod 2 = (i+1 + j mod 2) mod 2. So for each cycle j, the parity of the time steps for element i is (i+1 + j) mod 2. So the expected step for element i alternates between L and R in each cycle.

In this case, for a modified sequence of odd length K, the expected step for element i depends on the cycle. So for example, in the first cycle (j=0), the parity is (i+1) mod 2. In the second cycle (j=1), it's (i+1 + 1) mod 2. Third cycle (j=2) → (i+1 + 0) mod 2, and so on. Wait, j*K mod 2 for K odd: j*K mod 2 = j mod 2. Because K is odd. So j*K mod 2 is j mod 2. So (j*K + i +1) mod 2 = (j mod 2 + i+1) mod 2. So for each element i, the expected step alternates between (i+1) mod 2 and (i+1 +1) mod 2 as the cycles proceed.

Thus, for element i in the modified sequence (with odd K), the expected step for that position alternates between two possibilities. For example, in even-numbered cycles (j even), the expected step is based on (i+1) mod 2. In odd-numbered cycles, it's (i+1 +1) mod 2.

This complicates things because the same element in the modified sequence might be correct in some cycles and incorrect in others. However, since the sequence is repeated infinitely, the correct steps would average out over cycles. But calculating the correct percentage for an odd K requires considering the contribution of each element over even and odd cycles.

But how?

Suppose K is odd. Then, each element i in the modified sequence will have expected steps that alternate between two possibilities. So for each element, when it's an L or R, it can be correct in either even cycles, odd cycles, or both. However, since the cycles alternate, the total contribution of each element over all cycles is the average of being correct in even and odd cycles.

For example, if an element i is correct in even cycles but not in odd cycles, then over time, half the occurrences are correct. Similarly, if it's correct in both even and odd cycles, then all occurrences are correct.

Thus, for an odd K, the average contribution of element i is (correct_even + correct_odd) / 2, where correct_even is 1 if the element matches the expected step during even cycles (j even), and correct_odd is 1 if it matches during odd cycles. Then, the percentage is (sum over all elements ( (correct_even + correct_odd)/2 )) ) / K * 100.

So, for each element i in the modified sequence (when K is odd), we need to compute whether the element matches the expected step in even cycles and/or odd cycles.

But how do we model this?

Hmm. So the approach would be:

For a given modified sequence (with possible X's inserted), compute for each element i:

- if the element is X: contributes 0 to correct steps (since it's a break).
- else (L or R):

   For even K:

      expected_step = L if (i+1) is odd (i even) else R.

      if element matches expected_step: contributes 1 per occurrence. So total correct is (count_matches_even_K) * (number of cycles) → percentage is (count_matches_even_K) / K * 100.

   For odd K:

      expected_step_even_cycle = L if (i+1) is odd else R.

      expected_step_odd_cycle = L if (i+1 +1) is odd else R. Because during odd cycles (j is odd), j mod 2 is 1. So (i+1 +1) mod 2 → (i+2) mod 2 = i mod 2.

      So expected_step_even_cycle is based on (i+1) mod 2, and expected_step_odd_cycle is based on i mod 2.

      So for element i:

          in even cycles: check if element matches expected_step_even_cycle.

          in odd cycles: check if element matches expected_step_odd_cycle.

          the contribution per cycle is (correct_even + correct_odd) / 2.

      So for each element, its contribution is ( (correct_even ? 1 : 0 ) + (correct_odd ? 1 :0 ) ) / 2.

Thus, for each possible modified sequence (after adding X's), we can calculate the correct percentage as:

if K is even:

   correct = sum( (element i is L/R and matches expected_step_even_K) ) / K * 100.

if K is odd:

   correct = sum( ( (matches_even_cycle + matches_odd_cycle) / 2 ) ) / K * 100.

But the problem allows us to insert X's into the original sequence. However, the original sequence is given, and we can insert X's anywhere (any number of X's, including before, after, or between existing characters). The modified sequence is thus the original characters plus any X's we add. The key is that we can choose where to insert X's to maximize the correct percentage.

But considering that inserting X's can change K (the length of the modified sequence) and the positions of the original characters, this seems like a problem that requires us to model possible insertions and compute the best possible scenario.

But given that the original sequence can be up to 1e6 characters, we need an efficient approach. Trying all possible insertions is impossible. So we need a way to model the best possible K (even or odd) and maximize the correct steps.

But how?

Perhaps the optimal K is either even or odd, and for each possible K, we can compute the maximum possible correct steps. Then, choose the maximum between even and odd K's.

But even this approach is not feasible since K can be up to (original length + any number of X's). So we need to find a way to model the best possible K (even or odd) based on the original sequence.

Alternative idea: The optimal solution is to choose K even, because when K is even, each element's expected step is fixed, so we can align as many elements as possible. Alternatively, K could be odd but with a certain structure. But perhaps the optimal is to maximize the correct steps for even K, then for odd K, and choose the best between the two.

But how to model the possible insertions of X's to achieve the best K.

Wait, but inserting X's into the original sequence allows us to split the original elements with X's, but the order of the original elements must be preserved. For example, if the original sequence is LXRR, then the modified sequence must have L followed by X's, then X, then X's, etc., but the original characters must appear in their original order. So the modified sequence is a permutation of the original characters plus any number of X's inserted.

But when inserting X's, we can split the original sequence into parts, inserting X's between them. For example, the original sequence L X R R could be modified to L X X R X R, which splits the original characters into positions 0, 3, 4, 5 (assuming original sequence is L, X, R, R). Wait, no. The original sequence is L X R R. Inserting X's between them could lead to any number of X's between each pair of original characters, as well as at the beginning or end.

The modified sequence can be viewed as the original sequence's characters in order, but with X's inserted between any two characters (possibly zero) and at the beginning or end.

But the problem is to choose where to insert X's to maximize the correct percentage. The X's can be inserted anywhere, and their positions can affect the K (length of modified sequence) and the alignment of the original elements with the expected steps.

But how can we model this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model the problem in terms of the original sequence and possible insertions of X's. Each original character (L, R, X) can be preceded and followed by any number of X's. For example, for each original character S[i], we can insert x1 X's before it and x2 X's after it, where x1 and x2 are >=0. But since X's can be inserted anywhere, the total modified sequence is the original sequence with X's inserted between each pair of characters and possibly at the start and end.

But given the original sequence, the problem is to choose how many X's to insert between each pair of original characters and at the beginning and end, such that the modified sequence (after inserting X's) maximizes the correct percentage.

But the number of possibilities is infinite, so we can't try all possibilities. So we need a way to model the optimal insertions for even K and odd K.

Wait, but perhaps the optimal K is even. So we can model the optimal even-length K. Alternatively, the optimal K could be even or odd, and we need to compute both possibilities and choose the maximum.

But how?

Let's think about even K first.

Suppose K is even. Then, each element in the modified sequence has a fixed expected step. So for each element in the modified sequence (including X's inserted), if it is L or R, it contributes 1 to the correct count if it matches the expected step (based on its position's parity). X's contribute 0.

So the maximum possible correct percentage for even K is the maximum possible (number of matching elements) / K. But K is the length of the modified sequence, which can be increased by inserting X's. However, inserting X's adds elements to the sequence, which can lower the percentage (since X's contribute 0 to correct steps but increase K). So the optimal even K is achieved when we insert X's in such a way that the number of matching elements is as large as possible, while K is as small as possible (to maximize the ratio).

But how can we find the optimal even K?

Alternatively, perhaps the best even K is the minimal possible even K that allows the maximum number of original elements to be matched. For example, inserting X's between original elements to align them to even positions where their steps are correct.

But how can this be modeled?

Another idea: the modified sequence can be built by inserting X's before and after the original elements such that each original element (L or R) is placed in a position of the modified sequence where its expected step matches. For example, if an original element is L, then we want it to be in a position where the expected step is L. Similarly for R. X's can be inserted to shift the positions of the original elements to align them correctly.

But since the modified sequence's expected steps for even K are determined by their positions (even positions are R, odd are L?), wait no. For even K, each position i (0-based) in the modified sequence has expected step L if i is even (since (i+1) mod 2 is 1 when i is even). Wait, i+1 mod 2 is 1 for i even → expected step L. So for even K, each position i in the modified sequence (0-based) has expected step L if i is even, R if i is odd.

So for even K:

expected_step[i] = L if i is even, R if i is odd.

So, the problem is to arrange the original elements (L, R, X) in the modified sequence, inserting X's, such that each original L is placed in an even position (0, 2, 4, ...) and each original R is placed in an odd position (1,3,5,...). X's can be inserted in any positions, but they contribute nothing to the correct count.

Thus, the maximum number of correct steps for even K is the number of original L's placed in even positions plus the number of original R's placed in odd positions, divided by K (the length of the modified sequence). But since X's can be inserted to shift the positions of the original elements, we need to find a way to arrange them optimally.

But how?

The original elements must appear in the same order. So, for example, if the original sequence is L, X, R, R, then the modified sequence must have L followed by some X's, then X (original), then some X's, then R, then some X's, then R, etc. So the order of the original elements is preserved.

So the problem is to insert X's into the original sequence such that as many of the original L's and R's are placed in positions that match their expected steps (even positions for L, odd for R), and the remaining X's (original or inserted) are in any positions. The inserted X's can be used to shift the positions of the original elements.

So, the key is to find the optimal way to arrange the original L and R elements into positions of the modified sequence (even or odd) by inserting X's. X's can be added to increase the distance between elements, effectively shifting the positions of the subsequent elements.

For example, if we have an original L and want it to be in an even position, but the next element is an R that needs to be in an odd position. Inserting an X between them would shift the R's position by one. But this depends on how many X's are inserted before and after each element.

This seems similar to a dynamic programming problem where we track the current position parity and decide how many X's to insert after each original element to maximize the correct count.

Let me think of the original elements in order. For each element, we can decide how many X's to insert before it (if any) and after it (if any), such that the total number of X's inserted before and after allows the element to be placed in a desired parity position.

But since the elements must be processed in order, the position parity after inserting X's depends on the previous elements and X's inserted.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

We can model the process by tracking the current position modulo 2. For each original element, we can choose to insert some X's before it (if any) to shift the current position parity. Then, the element is placed at the current position (after inserting X's), and then we can insert some X's after it, which again shifts the current parity.

The goal is to choose the number of X's inserted before and after each element to maximize the number of correct steps (elements placed in correct parity positions for even K).

But even this approach could be feasible. Let's see:

The initial position is 0 (even), since the first element of the modified sequence is position 0.

For each element in the original sequence:

1. Insert any number of X's before it (possibly zero). Each X increases the current position by 1. So inserting k X's before the element would set current_pos = current_pos + k.

2. Place the element (original character) at current_pos. If it's L or R, check if the position is even (for L) or odd (for R). If so, it's a correct step. Then, current_pos increases by 1.

3. Insert any number of X's after it. current_pos increases by the number of X's inserted.

The key is to model the parity of the current_pos after each step, and for each original element, decide how many X's to insert before and after to maximize the count of correct steps.

But since we're considering even K, the total modified sequence length K is even. Wait, but the current_pos after processing all elements plus any X's inserted after them must result in K being even. Or perhaps the K is even, but the approach is to model the elements' positions modulo 2.

But perhaps the problem is that the K (total length) can be even or odd. So for even K, the evenness is determined by the total number of elements (original and inserted X's) being even.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, since K can be even, perhaps the optimal even K is not necessarily the minimal possible, but the one that maximizes the correct steps.

But this seems complicated. However, there's a way to model this with dynamic programming.

Let's model the current position parity (0 for even, 1 for odd). For each step in the original sequence, and for each possible parity (0 or 1), we track the maximum number of correct steps that can be achieved up to that point, considering the possible insertions of X's.

For example, the DP state is (i, p), where i is the index in the original sequence, and p is the current position parity (mod 2). The value stored is the maximum correct steps achievable up to the i-th element when the next position parity is p.

At each step, when processing the i-th original element, we can insert some X's before it. The number of X's inserted before can be 0, 1, etc., which changes the current parity. But since inserting k X's before the element will change the current parity from current_p to (current_p +k) mod 2. We want to choose k such that the element is placed in a position parity that matches its type (L, R, or X).

But for even K, the position parity of the element (current_p after inserting X's before) determines whether it's a correct step.

But the original element can be L, R, or X. For L/R, we need to check if their position is even/odd for even K.

So for each element S[i] in the original sequence:

If S[i] is L: inserting X's before to make the current_p even (since even position) would result in a correct step. Then, after placing the L, the position becomes (current_p + 1) mod 2 (since current_p was even → even +1 is odd).

If S[i] is R: inserting X's before to make current_p odd (position is odd) → correct step. Then, after placing R, position becomes (odd +1) mod 2 → even.

If S[i] is X: placing X is a break, so it doesn't contribute to correct steps. But the position increases by 1 (current_p changes).

Additionally, after placing the original element (S[i]), we can insert any number of X's after it. Each X inserted after it increases the position by 1. So inserting k X's after would change the parity from current_p' (after placing S[i]) to (current_p' +k) mod 2.

But since inserting X's after the element can affect the parity for the next element, but we have to model this.

However, since the inserted X's after the element can be any number, but we are interested in the parity, inserting k X's after S[i] will change the parity by k mod 2. So inserting even number of X's after S[i] doesn't change the parity. Inserting odd number of X's flips the parity.

Thus, for the dynamic programming approach, the state after processing S[i] would be the parity after inserting any number of X's after S[i]. Since inserting X's after S[i] can be even or odd, we can choose to have any parity.

Thus, for each element S[i], and current parity before inserting X's before it (p), we can:

1. Choose to insert k X's before, which changes p to (p + k) mod 2. Then, process S[i], which may contribute to correct steps if it's L/R and the parity is correct. Then, insert any number of X's after S[i], which changes the parity from (p +k +1) mod 2 (after placing the element) to any parity (by inserting even or odd number of X's).

But since after inserting X's after, we can choose to have any parity, the next state can be either 0 or 1.

Thus, the transitions would be:

For each state (i, current_p), and for the next element S[i], we can:

- Insert any number of X's before S[i], which changes current_p to new_p (either current_p or current_p +1 mod 2). Because inserting k X's can be chosen to set new_p to either parity (if current_p is even, inserting even number of X's keeps it even, inserting odd flips to odd).

- Process S[i], which contributes 1 to correct steps if it's L or R and new_p is even (for L) or odd (for R).

- Insert any number of X's after S[i], which changes the parity after S[i] (new_p +1 mod 2) to any parity (0 or 1).

Thus, the transition is as follows:

For each possible current_p (0 or 1):

   For the next element S[i], compute possible new_p (0 or 1) by inserting X's before.

   Then, if the element is L or R, check if new_p is correct (even for L, odd for R). If so, add 1 to the correct count.

   Then, insert X's after, which can set the next_p to 0 or 1. For each possible next_p, update the DP state.

But since inserting X's after can choose any parity, the transitions from the current new_p +1 (after placing the element) can flip to either parity.

So the DP transitions can be modeled as:

For each i in the original sequence:

   For each possible current_p (0 or 1):

      For possible new_p_before (0 or 1):

          (this is determined by inserting k X's before, where k is even or odd to change current_p to new_p_before)

          if S[i] is L:

              correct = 1 if new_p_before is even (0)

          elif S[i] is R:

              correct = 1 if new_p_before is odd (1)

          else (X):

              correct = 0

          after placing S[i], the parity is (new_p_before + 1) mod 2.

          then, inserting X's after can change this parity to next_p (0 or 1).

          So, the next state for i+1 is next_p.

          The total correct steps would be previous correct count + correct.

Thus, the DP state transitions are:

dp[i+1][next_p] = max(dp[i+1][next_p], dp[i][current_p] + correct)

for all possible next_p (0 or 1).

But how do we model the insertion of X's before and after each element?

The key insight is that inserting any number of X's before an element allows us to choose the parity of the position where the element is placed. Similarly, inserting any number of X's after allows us to choose the parity of the next element's starting position.

Therefore, for each element, we can choose the new_p_before (0 or 1) by inserting 0 or 1 X's (since inserting even X's before doesn't change the parity, inserting odd X's flips it). So for each current_p, new_p_before can be either current_p or 1 - current_p.

Then, after placing the element, the parity becomes new_p_before +1 mod 2. Then, inserting X's after can be 0 or 1 to reach next_p.

Thus, for each element and current_p, there are four possible transitions (two choices for new_p_before, two for next_p).

So the DP table would have O(N) * 2 states, and each state has transitions that take O(1) time. For N up to 1e6, this would be O(N) time, which is acceptable.

This approach models the best possible correct steps for even K. Because even K requires that the total number of elements (including X's) is even, but after processing all elements, the final parity must be even. But wait, the total K is the sum of all elements (original and inserted X's). However, in this DP approach, the final parity after processing all elements is not directly tracked. Instead, the transitions track the parity after each element and possible insertions. But for even K, the total number of elements must be even. So after processing all elements, the final parity (current_p) must be 0 (even). Because K is even → sum of all inserted X's and original elements is even.

But in this model, the DP tracks the parity after processing each element, which is the parity of the current position. After processing all elements, the sum of all elements and inserted X's must be even. So the final parity must be 0.

Thus, to model even K, the final state after processing all elements must have current_p 0. So the maximum correct count would be the maximum value between dp[N][0], considering that after processing all elements, the current_p is 0.

Similarly, for odd K, the final parity must be 1. But since the problem allows us to choose even or odd K, we need to compute both possibilities and choose the best.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, the DP approach can compute the maximum correct steps for even K and for odd K.

But first, let's focus on even K. The DP approach tracks the correct steps when the modified sequence has even length.

The steps for even K are:

Initialize dp[0][0] = 0 (starting at position 0, even parity, correct steps 0).

For each element in the original sequence (i from 0 to n-1):

   For current_p in 0, 1:

      if dp[i][current_p] is not -infinity:

          for new_p_before in 0, 1 (possible by inserting even or odd X's):

              if the element is L:

                  correct = 1 if new_p_before == 0 else 0.

              elif element is R:

                  correct = 1 if new_p_before == 1 else 0.

              else:  # X

                  correct = 0

              after_element_p = (new_p_before + 1) % 2

              for next_p in 0, 1:

                  # insert X's after to change after_element_p to next_p.

                  # this is possible by inserting (next_p - after_element_p) mod 2 X's.

                  new_total = dp[i][current_p] + correct

                  if new_total > dp[i+1][next_p]:

                      dp[i+1][next_p] = new_total

Thus, after processing all elements, the maximum correct steps for even K is the value of dp[n][0], divided by the total K (which must be even). But wait, the total K is the sum of all elements (original and inserted X's). How do we track K?

But in this model, we are not tracking K. We are tracking the current parity after each element. The total K is even if the final parity is 0 (since each element inserted increases the position by 1, so the total number of elements is even if the final parity is 0).

So for even K, the maximum correct steps is dp[n][0], and K must be even. The percentage is (dp[n][0] / K) * 100. But K is not known; it's the total number of elements (original + inserted X's) and must be even.

But how to compute K?

The problem is that K is the total number of elements in the modified sequence. Each original element contributes 1, and each inserted X contributes 1. So K = sum of 1 for each original element + sum of inserted X's.

But inserted X's can be any number. However, the DP model allows us to choose any number of X's inserted before and after each element. The number of inserted X's is not tracked in the model, only the parity transitions.

But without knowing K, how can we compute the percentage?

This is a critical problem. Because the correct steps percentage depends on K (the length of the modified sequence), which is not tracked in the DP model. So even if we know the maximum number of correct steps (C), we need to find the minimal possible K (even) that allows that C, to maximize C/K.

But how?

Wait, for even K:

The maximum possible C is the maximum correct steps achieved by the DP, which is dp[n][0].

But K is the number of elements in the modified sequence, which can be written as:

K = sum_{i=0 to n-1} (inserted X's before i-th element + 1 (for the element) + inserted X's after i-th element) + inserted X's after the last element.

But how can we model K in the DP?

This seems impossible, as the number of inserted X's is not tracked. So the approach of the DP as described is not sufficient to compute K, which is needed for the percentage.

Thus, this approach is not directly applicable. We need another way to model K.

Alternative idea: For even K, the maximum percentage is the maximum (C / K) where C is the number of correct steps and K is even. We need to find the maximum possible C/K for even K.

But how can we model this?

Suppose we can choose the minimal possible K for a given C, such that K is even. Then, C/K would be maximized.

But how to find this?

Alternatively, think of K as the sum of the original elements plus inserted X's. But since the inserted X's can be any number, we can choose K to be even, and for that K, arrange the elements to maximize C.

But this is not helpful.

Another Idea: The optimal even K is the minimal possible even K that allows the maximum C.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal even K is such that K is the minimal even number that allows the maximum C. But again, how to find this.

Alternatively, for each possible even K, compute the maximum C, then select the maximum C/K. But even this is not feasible for large K.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let's think differently.

Another approach: For the modified sequence to have even length K, the elements can be arranged such that the original L and R are placed in positions that match their expected steps (even for L, odd for R). Inserting X's can be used to shift elements into such positions. The X's do not contribute to correct steps but increase K. So the optimal even K is achieved when we arrange the original L and R elements into their correct positions (even/odd) with as few X's as possible. Because adding X's decreases the ratio C/K.

Thus, the problem reduces to arranging the original elements into their correct parity positions, and inserting the minimal number of X's to achieve that.

But how to find such a arrangement?

For example, consider the original sequence of L, X, R, R.

We can insert X's to make the modified sequence have even length and arrange the L and R's into correct positions.

For example, insert X's between L and X to make L X X X R X R. Then, the positions would be:

0: L (correct)

1: X 

2: X 

3: X 

4: R (position 4 is even → expected L. Incorrect.)

5: X 

6: R (position 6 even → expected L. Incorrect.

This is not helpful. Alternatively, another arrangement.

Original sequence L X R R:

Insert X's to make the modified sequence L X X R X R, which is length 6 (even). Positions:

0: L (correct)

1: X 

2: X 

3: R (position 3 is odd → correct R)

4: X 

5: R (position 5 is even → expected L. Incorrect.

So correct steps are L and R → 2/6 = 33.333% which is worse than the example's 50%.

Hmm.

In the example, the modified sequence is LXXRXR, which has length 6 (even). The correct steps are L (position 0), R (position 3), R (position 5). Position 5 is even (5 is odd, since position starts at 0). Wait, position 5 is 0-based. So position 5 in the modified sequence is time step 6. Time step 6 is even, expected R. So R is correct. So in this arrangement, the R at position 5 is correct. So the correct steps are L (0), R (3), R (5) → 3 correct steps out of 6 → 50% which matches the example.

So the arrangement has three correct steps in an even K=6. So C/K is 3/6=0.5.

But how to model this.

So the original R's are placed in positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is odd (correct for R), position 5 is even (incorrect for R). But in the example, it's correct. Wait, why?

Because in this case, the modified sequence is even K=6. So each position i's expected step is L if i is even (0,2,4), R if i is odd (1,3,5).

So in the modified sequence LXXRXR (elements 0 to 5):

element 0: L (even position → correct)

element 3: R (odd position → correct)

element 5: R (odd position → correct)

So three correct steps. So K=6, three correct steps. 50% correct.

So the key is to arrange the original elements into positions that match their expected steps.

Thus, the problem is to find a way to assign the original L's and R's to even or odd positions (depending on their type) in the modified sequence, preserving their order, and inserting X's between them. The X's are used to create the necessary spacing between the elements.

The minimal number of X's inserted between elements would allow us to maximize C/K.

But how to compute this?

Another Idea: For each original L and R in the sequence, determine whether they can be placed in a correct position (even for L, odd for R) by inserting X's before and/or after. The minimal number of X's required to shift them into such positions.

But since the positions depend on the previous elements and their inserted X's, this is a sequential problem.

This suggests a greedy approach where we track the current position and insert X's to move to the next desired position.

For example:

Start at position 0.

For each original element in the sequence:

   if it's L:

       desired position is even. So if current position is even, place it here (no X's inserted before). Then current position increments by 1. If it's odd, insert 1 X (current becomes even), then place L (current increments to even+1 = odd).

   if it's R:

       desired position is odd. So if current is odd, place it here. else, insert 1 X to make current even+1= odd. Then place R.

   if it's X:

       desired position can be any, since X's contribute nothing. But inserting X's here would require adding them to the modified sequence.

But wait, the original X's are part of the sequence. So if the original element is X, we have to include it in the modified sequence. But inserting X's before or after can affect the current position parity.

Wait, the original X's are part of the modified sequence, so they are included. So for example, if the original sequence has an X, it is placed in the modified sequence, and takes up a position. But inserting X's before or after it can shift the positions of the subsequent elements.

So, for each original X, we can choose to insert X's before or after it. But since the X is part of the sequence, it will take up a position, and the current position will increase by 1 (or more if X's are inserted before or after).

But since X's are part of the modified sequence, and we are trying to place them in positions that do not conflict with L or R steps.

But for the even K case, X's are placed in any positions. The key is to arrange the L and R's into even and odd positions, respectively.

But the original X's can be placed anywhere, but they take up positions, thus shifting subsequent elements.

Thus, the algorithm could proceed as follows:

Initialize current_pos = 0.

correct = 0.

for each element in the original sequence:

   if element is L:

       desired_pos = even.

       # find the next even position >= current_pos.

       if current_pos is even:

           no X's inserted before.

           place L here → correct +=1.

           current_pos +=1.

       else:

           insert 1 X → current_pos +=1 → even.

           place L here → correct +=1.

           current_pos +=1.

   elif element is R:

       desired_pos = odd.

       if current_pos is odd:

           no X's inserted before.

           place R here → correct +=1.

           current_pos +=1.

       else:

           insert 1 X → current_pos +=1 → odd.

           place R → correct +=1.

           current_pos +=1.

   else:  # element is X.

       # insert X's before and after to shift as needed.

       # but X can be placed in any position. We need to decide whether to insert X's before to adjust the current_pos.

       # but since X's are part of the modified sequence, but they don't contribute to correct steps, perhaps the optimal is to not insert any X's and proceed.

       current_pos +=1.

Thus, this greedy approach would try to place each L/R into the correct position by inserting X's when needed. However, this approach may not be optimal, but it's a starting point.

For example, let's consider the second example:

Input: LXRR

Original sequence: L, X, R, R.

Process each element:

Start at current_pos 0.

First element is L. current_pos is 0 (even) → place L. correct becomes 1. current_pos 1.

Second element is X. current_pos 1. Place X. current_pos becomes 2.

Third element is R. current_pos is 2 (even). desired is odd. Insert 1 X (current_pos becomes 3). Place R. correct becomes 2. current_pos 4.

Fourth element is R. current_pos 4 (even). Insert 1 X (current_pos 5). Place R. correct becomes 3. current_pos 6.

The modified sequence is L X X R X R, length 6 (even). Correct steps are 3, K=6 → 50% correct. Which matches the example.

This suggests that the greedy approach works for this case.

Another example:

Input is X. Then the modified sequence is X. K=1 (odd). But for even K, we have to make K even. So insert one X. K=2. But the X's in even K positions:

element 0: X → no correct step.

element 1: X → no correct step.

Thus, correct steps 0. 0/2=0% → but the original example output is 0.000000 for input X, which is correct.

But according to the problem statement, inserting X's can be done. So in this case, the modified sequence must have at least one X (the original X). Inserting another X makes K=2, but correct steps is zero.

Thus, the maximum is 0%.

This approach may work. So the greedy algorithm for even K:

current_pos starts at 0.

For each element:

   if it's L:

       if current_pos is even → place L (correct), current_pos +1.

       else → insert 1 X (current_pos becomes even), place L (correct), current_pos +1.

   elif it's R:

       if current_pos is odd → place R (correct), current_pos +1.

       else → insert 1 X (current_pos becomes odd), place R (correct), current_pos +1.

   else (X):

       place X → current_pos +1.

Thus, the total number of inserted X's is counted as needed to adjust the parity.

The total K is the sum of the original elements' count plus inserted X's. But how to calculate this?

But in the code, we can track the current_pos and count the inserted X's.

But how?

Another approach is to track the number of inserted X's as we go.

But for the purposes of computing K, the total length is the original length plus inserted X's.

But in the greedy approach, for each L/R element that needs to be shifted, we insert 1 X. For X elements, we may insert 0 X's.

For example, in the original sequence LXRR:

Original elements: 4.

Inserted X's: before the third R (1 X), and before the fourth R (1 X). So total inserted X's: 2. Thus, K = 4 + 2 =6.

correct steps: 3. So 3/6 = 50%.

Which matches the example.

Thus, this greedy approach seems to work.

But what about when inserting X's before L/R requires more than one X?

For example, original sequence is R. To place R in an odd position (desired). current_pos is 0 (even). Insert 1 X (current_pos becomes 1 → odd), place R → correct. current_pos becomes 2. K is 2 (modified sequence is X R). So correct steps 1, K=2 → 50% correct.

Which is better than not inserting X's (modified sequence is R, K=1. For even K, we must insert at least one X. So K=2 is even, correct steps 1/2=50%.)

But what if the sequence is R R.

First R: insert 1 X, place R (correct). current_pos 2 (even).

Second R: current_pos is even → insert 1 X (current_pos becomes odd), place R (correct). current_pos 4.

K is 4 (modified sequence X R X R). Correct steps 2/4 → 50%.

Thus, this approach works.

Thus, the greedy approach for even K is to insert X's before each L/R to shift them into the correct parity, and for X elements, just add them to the sequence.

But this approach may not always yield the maximum possible correct steps. For example, inserting X's may allow multiple L/R elements to be placed correctly with fewer inserted X's.

But given the time constraints, perhaps this greedy approach is sufficient.

Once we have the maximum correct steps for even K, we also need to consider the maximum correct steps for odd K.

For odd K, the expected step for each element i in the sequence alternates between even and odd cycles. Thus, the correct steps for each element is the average of being correct in even cycles and odd cycles.

But how to model this.

For odd K, the expected step for element i depends on the cycle number (even or odd). For example, during even cycles (j even), the parity of the time step for element i is (i+1) mod 2. During odd cycles (j odd), the parity is (i+1 + 1) mod 2 = (i+2) mod 2 = i mod 2.

Thus, for element i in the modified sequence (K is odd):

In even cycles:

expected step is L if i is even (i+1 mod 2 is 1).

In odd cycles:

expected step is L if i is odd (i mod 2 is 1).

So for each element i:

If it's L:

- correct in even cycles if i is even.

- correct in odd cycles if i is odd.

Thus, correct in 1/2 of the cycles on average.

If it's R:

- correct in even cycles if i is odd.

- correct in odd cycles if i is even.

Thus, correct in 1/2 of the cycles on average.

If it's X: no contribution.

But this would mean that for any L or R in an odd K sequence, the average contribution is 0.5. But this is only possible if the element's position i is fixed. For example, an L placed in position i (even) would be correct in even cycles but incorrect in odd cycles. So over time, 50% of the time it's correct. Similarly, if placed in an odd position, it's correct in odd cycles but incorrect in even.

Thus, the average contribution per L/R element is 0.5, regardless of its position. Except when the element's position i is such that even and odd cycles both have it correct. But that's possible only if i's parity is the same for both even and odd cycles, which is not possible. Because for even cycles, parity is (i+1) mod 2; for odd cycles, parity is i mod 2. So for an element to be correct in both even and odd cycles:

For L: expected step is L in both even and odd cycles. So in even cycles, expected L if (i+1) mod 2 is 1 (i even). In odd cycles, expected L if i mod 2 is 1 (i odd). So for both to be L, i even and i odd → impossible.

Thus, for any L or R in an odd K sequence, the average contribution is 0.5.

Thus, the maximum possible correct steps for an odd K sequence is (number of L and R) * 0.5. Thus, the percentage is (0.5 * (number of L and R)) / K * 100.

But K is odd, and the number of L and R is (sum of L and R in the original sequence plus inserted X's, but X's don't contribute).

Wait, no. Because inserting X's increases K but does not change the number of L and R. So for the odd K case, the number of L and R is fixed (equal to the original sequence's L and R). Because inserting X's adds X's, which don't contribute to L/R count. Thus, for odd K, the maximum possible correct steps is (original_L + original_R) * 0.5 / K * 100.

But since K is the modified sequence length (original length + inserted X's), which can be any odd number. To maximize (0.5*(original_LR) ) / K, we need to minimize K. The minimal possible K is the minimal odd length of the modified sequence, which is the original length plus inserted X's to make it odd.

But the original sequence length may be even or odd. If the original sequence's length is even, inserting one X makes it odd. If it's odd, no X's needed.

Thus, the minimal K for odd is:

if original_length is even: K = original_length + 1.

else: K = original_length.

But inserting X's can increase K beyond that. However, since we want to minimize K to maximize the ratio (0.5 * original_LR) / K, the best possible K is the minimal possible.

Thus, the maximum possible correct percentage for odd K is (0.5 * original_LR) / minimal_odd_K * 100.

So, the steps for the odd case are:

count_LR = number of L and R in the original sequence.

original_length = len(s).

if original_length % 2 == 0:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length +1.

else:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length.

percentage_odd = (0.5 * count_LR) / minimal_odd_K * 100.

But we can also choose to insert more X's to increase K to any larger odd number, which would decrease the percentage. So the best is to choose the minimal K.

Thus, the maximum percentage for odd K is (0.5 * count_LR) / minimal_odd_K * 100.

But this assumes that we can insert X's to make the sequence length odd, and that the L and R elements can be arranged in such a way that each contributes 0.5 on average. However, this may not be possible if the original elements are arranged in a way that their positions cannot be aligned to contribute 0.5 each.

But according to the earlier analysis, this is possible. Because during even cycles, each L/R contributes 0.5 if their position's parity is correct half the time. For odd K, the average contribution is 0.5 per L/R, regardless of their positions. So the maximum possible is indeed (count_LR * 0.5) / K.

Thus, for the odd case, the optimal percentage is (count_LR * 0.5) / K * 100, where K is the minimal possible odd length.

Thus, the overall algorithm is:

Compute the maximum between the even case and the odd case.

For the even case:

   Use the greedy algorithm to insert X's to align L and R elements into their correct parity positions. The correct steps are the number of L and R elements placed correctly. K is the total length of the modified sequence (original + inserted X's), which must be even.

   percentage_even = (correct_even / K_even) * 100.

For the odd case:

   count_LR is the number of L and R elements.

   minimal_odd_K is original_length if it's odd, else original_length +1.

   percentage_odd = (count_LR * 0.5) / minimal_odd_K * 100.

Thus, the maximum percentage is the maximum of percentage_even and percentage_odd.

But how to compute the even case.

The even case's correct_even and K_even can be computed using the greedy approach.

Let's implement this.

First, for the even case:

Initialize current_pos = 0.

inserted_x =0.

correct_even =0.

for each c in s:

   if c == 'L':

       if current_pos %2 ==0:

           # no need to insert X's.

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           # insert 1 X.

           inserted_x +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   elif c == 'R':

       if current_pos %2 ==1:

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           inserted_x +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   else: # X

       current_pos +=1

K_even = len(s) + inserted_x.

if K_even %2 !=0:

   # need to make it even. Insert one more X.

   inserted_x +=1

   K_even +=1

Thus, after processing all elements, if K_even is odd, insert an additional X to make it even.

This ensures K_even is even.

Then, percentage_even = (correct_even / K_even) * 100.

But what if K_even is zero? For example, if the original sequence is empty. But according to the problem statement, the input is a non-empty string (since the first example is X, which is length 1).

But in code, we need to handle empty string, but according to the constraints, the input sequence has length at least 1.

Thus, the code for the even case is:

current_pos =0

inserted_x =0

correct_even =0

for c in s:

   if c == 'L':

       if current_pos %2 ==0:

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           inserted_x +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   elif c == 'R':

       if current_pos %2 ==1:

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           inserted_x +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   else:

       current_pos +=1

# After processing all elements, check if K_even is even.

K_even = len(s) + inserted_x

if K_even %2 !=0:

   inserted_x +=1

   K_even +=1

   # Inserting an X at the end.

   # Since it's an X, it doesn't contribute to correct steps.

Thus, even if K_even is even after processing, we may have to add an X to make it even.

But in the code above, after processing all elements, K_even is the original length plus inserted_x. If it's odd, add one more X.

Once K_even is even, compute the percentage.

Now, the odd case:

count_LR = sum(1 for c in s if c in {'L', 'R'})

original_length = len(s)

if original_length %2 ==0:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length +1

else:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length

# But we can choose to insert X's to make K odd. But minimal_odd_K is the minimal.

if minimal_odd_K ==0:

   # impossible. But since s is non-empty, this won't happen.

   percentage_odd =0.0

else:

   percentage_odd = (count_LR * 0.5) / minimal_odd_K *100

Thus, the maximum percentage is the maximum between percentage_even and percentage_odd.

But wait, the percentage_odd could be higher if count_LR is large enough and minimal_odd_K is small.

For example, if the original sequence is all L's and R's arranged such that they can contribute 0.5 per element, and K is small.

But we need to compare this to the even case.

Finally, the overall maximum is the maximum of percentage_even and percentage_odd.

But we need to compute both and take the maximum.

Once we compute both, the answer is the maximum of the two, rounded to six decimal places.

So, the code steps are:

1. Compute the even case using the greedy approach.

2. Compute the odd case.

3. Take the maximum of the two percentages.

4. Output the maximum, rounded to six decimal places.

Let's test this approach on the given examples.

Example 1:

Input: X

Processing even case:

current_pos starts at 0.

The only character is X. current_pos increments by 1. inserted_x remains 0.

K_even is len(s) + inserted_x =1 +0 =1, which is odd. So insert 1 X. K_even becomes 2. correct_even is 0.

percentage_even = 0/2 *100 = 0%.

Odd case:

count_LR =0. So percentage_odd is 0.

So maximum is 0%.

Example 2:

Input: LXRR.

Processing even case:

elements: L, X, R, R.

Processing L:

current_pos 0 even. correct_even +=1. current_pos 1.

X: current_pos increments to 2.

R: current_pos 2 even. Insert 1 X (inserted_x=1). current_pos becomes 3 (odd). R is placed. correct_even +=1. current_pos 4.

R: current_pos 4 even. Insert 1 X (inserted_x=2). current_pos 5 (odd). Place R. correct_even +=1. current_pos 6.

K_even =4 +2 =6 (even). So percentage_even =3/6 *100= 50%.

Odd case:

count_LR =3 (L and two R's).

original_length is 4, even. minimal_odd_K =4+1=5.

percentage_odd = (3 *0.5)/5 *100 = 1.5 /5 *100 =30%.

Thus, maximum is 50%.

Which matches the example.

Another test case: Input is R.

Even case:

current_pos 0. c is R.

current_pos is even → insert 1 X. inserted_x=1. current_pos becomes 1. place R (correct_even +=1). current_pos 2.

K_even =1 +1 =2 (even). correct_even is 1. percentage_even =1/2 *100=50%.

Odd case:

count_LR =1.

original_length is 1 (odd). minimal_odd_K=1.

percentage_odd = 0.5 /1 *100=50%.

Thus, maximum is 50%.

So code would return 50.000000.

Which is correct.

Thus, this approach works.

Now, let's code this.

The code steps:

Read the input string s.

Compute even case:

current_pos =0

inserted_x_even =0

correct_even =0

for c in s:

   if c == 'L':

       if current_pos %2 ==0:

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           inserted_x_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   elif c == 'R':

       if current_pos %2 ==1:

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           inserted_x_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

           correct_even +=1

           current_pos +=1

   else:

       current_pos +=1

K_even = len(s) + inserted_x_even

if K_even %2 !=0:

   inserted_x_even +=1

   K_even +=1

percentage_even = correct_even / K_even *100 if K_even !=0 else 0.0

Compute odd case:

count_LR = sum(1 for c in s if c in {'L', 'R'})

original_length = len(s)

if original_length %2 ==0:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length +1

else:

   minimal_odd_K = original_length

if minimal_odd_K ==0:

   percentage_odd =0.0

else:

   percentage_odd = (count_LR *0.5) / minimal_odd_K *100

max_percentage = max(percentage_even, percentage_odd)

print(f"{max_percentage:.6f}")

But wait, in the even case, after processing all elements, K_even is len(s) + inserted_x_even, which is the original length plus inserted X's. Then, if it's odd, we add one more X.

Thus, the code correctly computes K_even and correct_even.

Sample 2:

Input LXRR:

even case:

correct_even=3, K_even=6. 3/6=50%.

odd case: count_LR=3, minimal_odd_K=5. 1.5/5=30%. Max is 50%.

Sample 3: input R.

even case: correct_even=1, K_even=2. 50%.

odd case: count_LR=1, minimal_odd_K=1. 0.5/1 *100=50%. Max is 50%.

Another test case: input 'LR'.

even case:

Processing L:

current_pos 0 even → correct_even=1. current_pos 1.

R: current_pos 1 is odd → correct_even=2. current_pos 2.

K_even=2, inserted_x_even=0. percentage_even=100%.

odd case: minimal_odd_K=3. count_LR=2. 1.0/3 *100=33.333333. So max is 100%.

But the code for even case would compute K_even=2, correct_even=2. So percentage_even=100%.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, this approach should handle all test cases correctly.
