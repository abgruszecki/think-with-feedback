<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So we have a tree with n nodes, rooted at 1. Each node has a list that's initially empty. Then, there are m operations. Each operation i adds i to all nodes in the subtree of ai, then adds i to all nodes in the subtree of bi. After all operations, for each node i, we need to find ci, which is the number of other nodes j (j ≠ i) such that the list of i and j share at least one common number.

Hmm. The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n and m can be up to 1e5. So a naive approach where we process each node's list and compare with others is impossible. We need a smarter way.

Let me think about the problem structure. Each operation i affects two subtrees. For each node, its list contains all the operations i where it's in either of the two subtrees (ai's subtree or bi's subtree). So, two nodes j and k will have a common number if there's at least one operation i that includes j in either subtree and k in either subtree of the same operation.

Wait, no. The operation adds i to both subtrees. So for each i, all nodes in the subtree of ai and all nodes in the subtree of bi get i added. So a node can get i if it's in ai's subtree, or in bi's subtree. So two nodes share a common i if there's at least one i where both are in the ai's subtree, or both in bi's subtree, or one is in ai's subtree and the other in bi's subtree. So any overlap in the coverage of the same operation i.

So for two nodes u and v, their lists share at least one common element if there exists an operation i such that u is in the subtree of ai or bi, and v is in the subtree of ai or bi. Because when i is added, it's added to both subtrees, so any node in either of those subtrees for that i would have i in their list.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. For operation i, first, add i to all nodes in ai's subtree, then add i to all nodes in bi's subtree. So for any node in either subtree, they get i. So a node that is in ai's subtree, or bi's subtree, will have i in their list. So two nodes u and v will have i in their lists if u is in either subtree, and v is in either subtree. So for that i, they share i. Thus, the presence of any such i in the intersection of their lists.

So the problem reduces to, for each node u, count the number of other nodes v (v != u) such that there exists at least one operation i where u and v are both covered by the i-th operation (i.e., u is in ai's or bi's subtree, and same for v).

So the key is to find for each u, the number of nodes v that share at least one operation i where both are covered by i.

How can we model this? For each operation i, the set of nodes covered is the union of the subtree of ai and the subtree of bi. Let's call this set S_i. Then, the pairs (u, v) that are connected by this operation are all pairs in S_i × S_i. So the total number of pairs (u, v) that are connected by any operation is the union over all i of S_i × S_i.

But the problem requires, for each u, the count of v (v ≠ u) such that (u, v) is in the union of all S_i × S_i.

This is equivalent to the size of the union of all S_i × S_i for each u and v. But directly computing this is impossible for 1e5 nodes and 1e5 operations.

Alternative approach: For each node u, find all operations i that include u. Then, for each such i, the nodes that are in S_i (the union of ai's subtree and bi's subtree) will have a connection to u. However, since multiple operations can contribute to the same u-v pair, but we need to count it only once if any of them contribute.

So the problem is to find, for each u, the total number of nodes v (v ≠ u) such that there exists at least one i where both u and v are in S_i.

Thus, for each u, the answer is (sum over all i where u is in S_i of the size of S_i) minus the sum over overlaps (when multiple i's include the same pair (u, v)), but since we need to count each pair (u, v) only once if they are in any S_i together, this becomes the size of the union of all S_i that contain u, for each u.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Hmm. Let me think of inclusion-exclusion. But for large n and m, that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each node u, collect all the operations that include u. Then, the nodes v that share at least one operation with u are the union of all S_i where u is in S_i. So the size of this union, minus 1 (for u itself).

So the key is to compute for each u, the total number of nodes in the union of all S_i where u is in S_i. Then subtract 1 (since v cannot be u) to get c_u.

Wait, yes. Because for each such S_i, u is in S_i, and all nodes in S_i are in the set of possible v's. But since the same v can be in multiple S_i's, but we only count them once. So the union of all S_i where u is in S_i gives all the v's (including u) that have at least one operation i where both u and v are in S_i. So the size of this union minus 1 is the answer for u.

So the problem reduces to, for each node u, compute the size of the union of all S_i that contain u, then subtract 1. That's the c_u.

So the question now is: how to compute, for each node u, the size of the union of all S_i where u is in S_i.

Each S_i is the union of the subtree rooted at ai and the subtree rooted at bi.

Hmm. So for each operation i, S_i is the union of two subtrees.

So for each u, we need to find all i where u is in S_i (i.e., u is in the subtree of ai or in the subtree of bi). Then, the union of all S_i for those i is the set of nodes v that are in any of the S_i where u is in S_i.

So the problem is to compute the size of the union of all such S_i for each u.

But how? The number of operations per u could be up to 1e5, and each S_i can be up to n nodes. So directly handling this is impossible.

We need a way to model the union of S_i's for each u efficiently.

Let's think of the S_i's in terms of their coverage. Each S_i is the union of two subtrees. The union of multiple S_i's is the combination of all those subtrees' nodes.

Wait, but the S_i's that include u are those operations where ai's subtree contains u, or bi's subtree contains u. So for each operation i, if u is in subtree(ai) or subtree(bi), then S_i is added to the collection for u.

So for each u, the union of all S_i's (where i is in the set of operations that include u) is the union of all subtree(ai) and subtree(bi) where i is such that u is in either subtree(ai) or subtree(bi).

So the question becomes: for each u, collect all the subtree(ai) and subtree(bi) for i where u is in subtree(ai) or subtree(bi), then take the union of all those subtrees and the subtrees (ai's and bi's) of those i's.

The size of this union is the number of nodes that share at least one operation with u, including u itself. So subtract 1 to get c_u.

The problem now is to compute the size of the union of all these subtrees for each u.

But how to do this efficiently?

First, note that the subtree of a node x can be represented as all nodes in the subtree of x. So, for each node x, the size of its subtree is known, and the nodes in the subtree can be represented by their in-time and out-time when traversing the tree (using a DFS order, for example). So, a node is in x's subtree if its in-time is between x's in-time and out-time.

But how do we manage the union of all these subtrees for a given u?

Alternative approach: For each operation i, which contributes ai's and bi's subtrees to the S_i. For a node u, if u is in S_i (i.e., u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree), then S_i's nodes (the union of ai's and bi's subtrees) are added to the union for u.

So for each u, the union is the set of all nodes that are in any of the ai's or bi's subtrees for i where u is in S_i.

So for each u, the union is the set of nodes covered by any ai's subtree or bi's subtree where i is an operation that includes u (u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree).

Wait, but for i to be in the set of operations that include u, that i's S_i (the union of ai's and bi's) must contain u. So i can be in the set of operations that include u in two ways: either u is in ai's subtree, or u is in bi's subtree. So for each i where u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree, then the subtrees of ai and bi contribute to the union for u.

So the union is the union of all ai's and bi's subtrees for such i.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let me rephrase: For each u, collect all nodes x such that x is ai or bi for some operation i where u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree. Then, the union of all subtrees of these x's gives the nodes that are in any S_i for i that include u.

Wait, not exactly. Because for each such operation i, S_i is the union of ai's subtree and bi's subtree. So, even if u is in ai's subtree, the S_i includes bi's subtree as well. So for the union, not only the subtrees of ai and bi where u is in S_i, but also any other x's subtrees from other operations where u is in their S_i.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's think of it this way: For each operation i, the S_i is the union of ai's and bi's subtrees. So when u is in S_i (i.e., u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree), then all nodes in S_i (the union of ai and bi's subtrees) are part of the union for u.

So for each such i, the nodes in ai's subtree and bi's subtree are added to the union. So the union for u is the union of all such ai's and bi's subtrees for all i where u is in S_i.

But how can we model this? Since the subtree of a node x is a contiguous interval in the in-time of a DFS traversal, perhaps we can represent each subtree as a range [start, end] in the in-time order.

The union of all such ranges would be a collection of intervals, and the size of the union is the sum of the lengths of the merged intervals.

But even this approach might not be feasible for each u, given that the number of such ranges can be very large.

Alternative idea: For each operation i, when processing the nodes, we can note for each node u whether u is in S_i (ai's or bi's subtree). Then, for each u, collect all the i's where this is true. But storing all such i's for each u is O(mn), which is not acceptable.

Another angle: For each operation i, the set S_i is the union of two subtrees. Let's model S_i as two ranges in the in-time order. The union of these two ranges is the set of nodes in S_i. So for each i, S_i can be represented as two intervals (or a single interval if the two ranges overlap). But the union can be up to two intervals per S_i.

But how does this help us?

For each u, the union of all S_i's where u is in S_i is the same as the union of all S_i's that include u.

So for each u, we need to find the union of all S_i's that contain u, and compute the size of that union.

But how to do this efficiently for all u?

Hmm. Let's consider that for each S_i (the union of ai and bi's subtrees), the nodes in S_i are covered. For each node u in S_i, this S_i contributes to the union of u's coverage.

So for each S_i, all nodes in S_i will have S_i added to their coverage.

But how can we aggregate this for all u?

This seems like a problem that can be approached with inclusion-exclusion, but I'm not seeing a clear path.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the coverage for each u as the union of all S_i that include u. The size of this coverage is the number of nodes in this union.

We need to find, for each u, the number of nodes in the union of all S_i where u is in S_i.

Let’s model each S_i as a set of nodes and track for each node u, all the S_i's that include u. Then, the coverage for u is the union of these S_i's.

But again, for m=1e5 and n=1e5, this is impossible.

Alternative idea: Instead of processing each operation and node, can we find a way to precompute for each node u, all the S_i's that include u, and then compute the union of their ranges efficiently?

Wait, perhaps using some inclusion properties of the subtrees.

For example, if a node x's subtree is entirely contained within node y's subtree, then any S_i that includes x's subtree would also include y's subtree if x is in y's subtree. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, for each node u, the operations that include u in their S_i are those where u is in the ai's subtree or in the bi's subtree.

So for each operation i, the S_i includes u if u is in the ai subtree or bi subtree. So for u, the relevant S_i's are those where i's ai or bi is an ancestor of u (or u itself) such that the subtree includes u.

Wait, the ai's subtree includes u if ai is an ancestor of u. So for ai to have u in its subtree, ai must be on the path from the root to u.

Wait, the subtree of a node x is all the descendants of x (including x itself). So u is in x's subtree if and only if x is an ancestor of u (or x is u). So for u to be in x's subtree, x must be on the path from the root (node 1) to u.

So for each operation i, u is in S_i if and only if u is in ai's subtree (i.e., ai is an ancestor of u) or u is in bi's subtree (bi is an ancestor of u).

So for each u, the relevant operations are those where ai is an ancestor of u or bi is an ancestor of u.

But how can we efficiently find all such operations i for each u?

Hmm. Let's preprocess for each node x, the list of operations where x is ai or bi. Then, for each u, the relevant operations are the union of the operations where ai is an ancestor of u (from the ai's list) and the operations where bi is an ancestor of u (from the bi's list).

Wait, but how to find for each u all x that are ancestors of u, and collect all the operations where x is ai or bi.

Alternatively, for each operation i, let's consider the ai and bi. For any u that is in ai's subtree or in bi's subtree, this operation contributes S_i (ai's and bi's subtree union) to u's coverage.

But how to model the S_i's union for u.

Another thought: For each node u, the coverage is the union of all the S_i's (ai and bi's subtrees) where u is in S_i. So the coverage is the union of all the ai's and bi's subtrees for which ai is an ancestor of u or bi is an ancestor of u.

But perhaps we can model this as the union of all subtrees of nodes that are in the set A(u) ∪ B(u), where A(u) is all ai's for which ai is an ancestor of u, and B(u) is all bi's for which bi is an ancestor of u. Then, the coverage for u is the union of the subtrees of all nodes in A(u) ∪ B(u).

Wait, but for each operation i where ai is an ancestor of u (so u is in ai's subtree), then the S_i for that operation includes the subtree of ai and the subtree of bi. But for the coverage of u, since S_i includes u (because u is in ai's subtree), then S_i's nodes (ai's subtree ∪ bi's subtree) are added to the coverage of u. So the coverage is the union of all such ai's subtree and bi's subtree for those i where ai is an ancestor of u, plus the same for bi's ancestors.

Alternatively, perhaps for each u, the coverage is the union of:

- For all operations i where ai is an ancestor of u: the subtree of ai and the subtree of bi.

- For all operations i where bi is an ancestor of u: the subtree of ai and the subtree of bi.

So the coverage is the union of all ai's subtree and bi's subtree for any i where ai is ancestor of u or bi is ancestor of u.

Hmm. But that seems like a lot of subtrees to union. How can this be done efficiently?

Let me consider the in-time and out-time of the nodes in a DFS traversal. Each subtree can be represented as a range [in[x], out[x]] in the in-time order. So the subtree of x is all nodes with in-time between in[x] and out[x].

The union of multiple subtrees can be represented as the union of their in-time ranges. The size of the union is the sum of the lengths of the merged ranges.

But for each u, if we can collect all the ranges [in[x], out[x]] where x is ai or bi for some i where ai is an ancestor of u or bi is an ancestor of u, then merging these ranges and summing their lengths would give the coverage size.

But how to collect all such x for each u.

This seems challenging. Let's think of for each node x, the set of operations where x is ai or bi. Then, for each u, if x is an ancestor of u, then all those operations would contribute x's subtree to the coverage of u.

Wait, no. Because for each operation i where x is ai, then for any u in x's subtree (i.e., x is an ancestor of u), this i's ai is x, so the operation contributes ai's subtree (x's subtree) and bi's subtree to u's coverage.

Wait, but in this case, the operation i would contribute x's subtree and the bi's subtree to the coverage of u. So, for any u in x's subtree, the coverage for u includes x's subtree (which contains u) and bi's subtree. So the S_i for this operation is the union of x's and bi's subtrees.

But for the coverage of u, all such S_i's (for all i where x is ai and u is in x's subtree) would contribute their x's and bi's subtrees. Similarly, for all i where x is bi and u is in x's subtree, their ai's and x's subtrees are added.

Hmm. So for each x, and for all u in x's subtree, all the operations where x is ai or bi will contribute their respective subtrees (ai's and bi's) to u's coverage.

But how can we model this for all x and u?

Alternative idea: Let's precompute for each node x, the list of all operations where x is ai or bi. Then, for each x, all nodes in x's subtree (including x) will have all the S_i's (the union of ai's and bi's subtrees) added to their coverage. So for x's subtree, all the S_i's where x is ai or bi are added.

Wait, no. For example, if x is ai in operation i, then the S_i is the union of x's subtree and bi's subtree. So all nodes in x's subtree (u) will have S_i added to their coverage. So for u in x's subtree, S_i (x's subtree and bi's subtree) is added. So the coverage for u would include x's subtree (which is already part of u's coverage, as u is in x's subtree), and bi's subtree.

But how to aggregate all these contributions.

This seems complex. Let's think of each operation's contribution. For each operation i, which has ai and bi. Then, the S_i is the union of ai's and bi's subtrees. For any node u in S_i (i.e., u is in ai's subtree or bi's subtree), the S_i is added to their coverage. So the S_i contributes its nodes to the coverage of all u in S_i.

So for each S_i, the nodes in S_i will have their coverage increased by the nodes in S_i. But the coverage is a union of all such S_i's.

So, for all u in S_i, the S_i is part of their coverage.

Thus, for each S_i, the coverage for all u in S_i is augmented by adding S_i's nodes.

But how can we model the union of all S_i's for each u?

Another idea: For each node u, the coverage is the union of all S_i's that contain u. So the problem is equivalent to, for each u, find the number of nodes in the union of all S_i's where u is in S_i.

So, for each S_i, we can note that all nodes in S_i (ai's and bi's subtree) are in the coverage of u if u is in S_i.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Hmm. Let's consider that each S_i is a set of nodes. The total coverage for a node u is the number of nodes in the union of all S_i's that contain u.

But how to compute this for all u.

Wait, but this is equivalent to for each node v, count how many u's have v in at least one S_i that contains u. Then, for each u, the answer is the number of such v's minus 1 (since v can't be u).

But no, that's the reverse. Wait, for each u, c_u is the number of nodes v != u such that there exists an S_i that contains both u and v.

Which is equivalent to the number of v's (v != u) that are in the union of all S_i's that contain u.

So, the problem is to compute for each u, the size of the union of all S_i's that contain u, minus 1.

But how to model the union.

Alternative approach: For each node v, find all nodes u such that there exists at least one S_i that contains both u and v. Then, the count for u is the number of such v's (excluding u) summed over all u.

But again, this seems tricky.

Another angle: Let's precompute for each node v, all the S_i's that contain v. Then, for each S_i, the nodes in S_i form a clique where each pair of nodes (u, v) in S_i has their mutual counts incremented. But since we need to count each pair only once, this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, the number of pairs (u, v) where u and v share at least one S_i is equal to the sum over all S_i of (size(S_i) choose 2) minus the sum over overlapping pairs. But inclusion-exclusion here is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find for each node u, the total number of nodes in all S_i's that contain u, then subtract the overlaps. But again, this seems challenging.

Wait, but perhaps for each node u, the total size of the union of S_i's that contain u is equal to the number of nodes v that are in any of the S_i's containing u. So this is exactly what we need.

So, the problem is to find for each u, the size of the union of all S_i's that include u.

Let me think of how to compute this.

Each S_i is a set of nodes, which is the union of two subtrees. Each subtree can be represented by their in-time and out-time.

So for each S_i, the nodes in S_i can be represented as two intervals. For example, if the ai's subtree is [a_start, a_end] and bi's subtree is [b_start, b_end], then S_i's nodes are the union of these two intervals, which could be one or two intervals.

Now, for each u, the S_i's that include u are those where u is in S_i. So u must be in either ai's subtree or bi's subtree.

So, for each such S_i, the two intervals of S_i contribute to the coverage of u.

The coverage for u is the union of all such intervals from all S_i's that include u.

The size of this coverage is the number of nodes in the merged intervals.

So the problem reduces to, for each u, collect all intervals (from S_i's that include u) and compute the merged length.

But how to do this efficiently for all u.

This seems like a heavy problem. Let's consider the following steps:

1. Preprocess the tree to compute in-time and out-time for each node using a DFS traversal. This allows us to check if a node is in a subtree (if its in-time is between the in and out times of the subtree's root).

2. For each operation i, represent S_i as the union of the intervals for ai's subtree and bi's subtree. So each S_i is up to two intervals.

3. For each node u, collect all S_i's where u is in S_i (i.e., u is in ai's or bi's subtree).

4. For each u, merge the intervals from all S_i's collected and compute the total length.

But steps 3 and 4 are the challenging parts.

For step 3: How to find, for each u, all the S_i's that include u.

But for m=1e5, and each S_i possibly involving O(1) nodes (ai and bi), perhaps we can precompute for each node x, the list of S_i's where x is ai or bi, and then for each u, collect all S_i's where ai is an ancestor of u or bi is an ancestor of u.

Wait, because u is in S_i iff u is in ai's subtree or in bi's subtree. So for S_i to include u, ai must be an ancestor of u, or bi must be an ancestor of u.

So for each u, the S_i's that include it are those where ai is an ancestor of u, or bi is an ancestor of u.

So for each u, we need to find all S_i's where ai is in the path from the root to u, or bi is in the path from the root to u.

But how can we find these efficiently for all u?

The key insight here is that for each node u, its ancestors are on the path from the root to u. So for each operation i, if ai is an ancestor of u, then u is in ai's subtree. Similarly for bi.

So for each u, the S_i's that include it are the union of:

- All operations where ai is an ancestor of u.

- All operations where bi is an ancestor of u.

So for each u, the relevant S_i's are those where ai is an ancestor of u or bi is an ancestor of u.

Now, the problem is to collect all these S_i's for each u and compute the merged intervals.

But how?

Alternative idea: For each node x, precompute the list of operations where x is ai or bi. Then, for any u, x is an ancestor of u if and only if x is on the path from root to u.

So for each u, the S_i's that include u are the operations in the lists of x, where x is an ancestor of u (including u itself) and x is either ai or bi in the operation i.

So, for each u, we can iterate over all ancestors x of u, and collect all operations where x is ai or bi. For each such operation, we add the S_i's intervals (ai's and bi's subtree ranges) to the coverage of u.

But how to do this efficiently for all u.

But the number of ancestors for each u is O(log n) if the tree is balanced, but in the worst case (like a chain), it's O(n). For 1e5 nodes, this would be O(n^2) operations, which is impossible.

This suggests that this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: For each operation i, we can represent S_i as the union of ai's and bi's subtree intervals. Then, for each node u, if u is in S_i, add the intervals of S_i to u's coverage.

But again, for m=1e5 and n=1e5, this is O(mn), which is impossible.

Hmm. Need to find a way to model this without iterating per node.

Another angle: Let's think of the coverage for each u as the union of all ai's and bi's subtrees for operations i where u is in S_i. This can be rewritten as the union of all ai's subtrees for which ai is an ancestor of u, plus all bi's subtrees for which bi is an ancestor of u, plus the ai's subtrees for which bi is an ancestor of u, plus the bi's subtrees for which ai is an ancestor of u.

Wait, no. For a given i, S_i is ai's subtree ∪ bi's subtree. So for u to be in S_i, it's enough to be in either of them. So S_i's contribution to u's coverage is ai's subtree and bi's subtree. So even if u is only in ai's subtree, the entire S_i (ai's and bi's) is added to u's coverage.

So for each i where ai is an ancestor of u, then the S_i (ai's and bi's) are added to u's coverage. Similarly for bi.

So the coverage for u is the union of all ai's and bi's subtrees from all i where ai is an ancestor of u, plus the union of all ai's and bi's subtrees from all i where bi is an ancestor of u.

But this is the same as the union of all ai's subtrees, bi's subtrees for i where ai is ancestor of u, and all ai's subtrees, bi's subtrees for i where bi is ancestor of u.

So the coverage is the union of all ai's and bi's subtrees for i where ai is ancestor of u or bi is ancestor of u.

So how can we model this as a range of intervals.

Perhaps for each node x, collect all the ai's and bi's subtrees from operations i where x is either ai or bi. Then, for each u, collect all x's that are ancestors of u, and add their ai's and bi's subtrees.

Wait, but x can be ai or bi. For example, x is ai in some operation i. Then, the S_i for that operation is x's subtree and bi's subtree. So, for any u in x's subtree (ancestor of u), the S_i contributes x's subtree and bi's subtree to u's coverage.

So, for each x, the operations where x is ai or bi will contribute their S_i's to the coverage of u if x is an ancestor of u.

So for each x, for all operations i where x is ai or bi, the S_i's subtrees (ai's and bi's) are added to the coverage of any u in x's subtree.

But how to aggregate all these contributions.

Let's think in terms of ranges. For each x, the subtree of x is a range [in[x], out[x]]. The coverage contribution for x's subtree (u in x's subtree) would be the union of all S_i's where x is ai or bi.

So for each x, collect all the S_i's (ai's and bi's subtree ranges) from the operations where x is ai or bi. Then, for each u in x's subtree, these S_i's are part of their coverage.

So, for each x, the union of all S_i's where x is ai or bi is a set of ranges. For any u in x's subtree, these ranges are added to their coverage.

So the coverage for a node u is the union of all ranges from all x's that are ancestors of u (including u itself), where x is involved in operations as ai or bi.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Ah! Now this is an interesting direction. Let's proceed.

For each x, precompute the union of all S_i's where x is ai or bi. Let's call this U_x. Each U_x is a set of ranges (intervals) in the in-time order. Then, for each u, the coverage is the union of U_x for all x that are ancestors of u.

So the problem reduces to, for each u, compute the union of all U_x's for x in the path from root to u. Then, the size of this union is the coverage size.

Now, the question is, how to precompute U_x for all x, and then for each u, compute the union of U_x for x in their ancestor path.

But how to compute the union of these ranges for each u.

First, let's precompute U_x for each x.

Each U_x is the union of all S_i's where x is ai or bi. Each S_i is the union of ai's and bi's subtree ranges. So for each such i, where x is ai or bi, the S_i is the union of the ranges of ai and bi.

Wait, no. For example, if x is ai in operation i, then S_i is the union of x's subtree and bi's subtree. So U_x (for x) would include x's subtree and bi's subtree for all such i's. Similarly, if x is bi in operation j, then S_j is the union of aj's subtree and x's subtree. So U_x would include aj's and x's subtree for those j's.

So U_x is the union of all S_i's where x is either ai or bi. Each S_i in this collection is the union of ai's and bi's subtrees.

But for U_x, each S_i where x is ai or bi contributes two ranges: the subtree of ai and the subtree of bi. So U_x is the union of all such ranges from all such i's.

So U_x can be represented as a set of merged intervals. For example, if there are multiple ranges that overlap, we can merge them into non-overlapping intervals.

Once we have U_x for each x, then for any u, the coverage is the union of U_x for all x that are ancestors of u.

The size of the coverage is the sum of the lengths of the merged intervals.

So the steps would be:

1. Perform a DFS to compute in[x] and out[x] for each node x, which defines their subtree ranges.

2. For each operation i (ai, bi), compute the ranges of ai's subtree and bi's subtree, and for each of ai and bi, add those two ranges to their U_ai and U_bi sets.

Wait, no. For each operation i, when x is ai, then the S_i is ai's and bi's subtree. So for U_ai, we need to add ai's and bi's ranges. Similarly, for x=bi, the S_i is ai's and bi's ranges, so U_bi would have both ranges added.

So for each operation i (ai, bi):

   a. Add the ranges [in[ai], out[ai]] and [in[bi], out[bi]] to U_ai's collection.

   b. Add the same ranges to U_bi's collection.

Wait, no. Because when x is ai, the S_i for this operation is the union of ai's and bi's ranges. So U_ai (the union for x=ai) includes all S_i's where x is ai. So for each i where x is ai, U_x includes S_i's ranges (ai and bi's ranges).

Similarly, for x=bi, each i where x is bi contributes S_i's ranges (ai and bi's ranges).

So for each operation i, we need to add ai's and bi's ranges to U_ai and U_bi.

So for each operation i:

- For x = ai: add the two ranges [in[ai], out[ai]] and [in[bi], out[bi]] to U_ai.

- For x = bi: add the same two ranges to U_bi.

Once all operations are processed, each U_x will have a collection of ranges from all operations where x is ai or bi.

Then, for each x, we merge the ranges in U_x to form a set of non-overlapping intervals.

Now, for each u, the coverage is the union of all U_x where x is an ancestor of u. So for all x in the path from the root to u, the ranges in U_x are merged, and the sum of their lengths is the coverage size.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The key is to model the union of intervals from all ancestors of u.

But the problem is that for each u, the set of ancestors is the path from the root to u. For example, in a chain tree, this path can be O(n) long, which makes it impossible to process for each u individually.

Thus, we need a way to precompute for each node u, the merged intervals of all U_x for x in the ancestor path of u.

This seems challenging. However, the intervals are in the in-time order, which is a linear sequence. Perhaps we can model this using a segment tree or other data structure that can handle interval unions efficiently.

Alternatively, we can think of the intervals for each ancestor x as being added incrementally along the path from root to u. Since the path is from root to u, which is a linear chain of ancestors, perhaps we can use a dynamic data structure that allows merging intervals as we add them.

But for 1e5 nodes, each with possibly O(1) intervals in U_x, this would require O(n) operations, which may be manageable.

Wait, but for each u, the number of ancestors is O(n) in the worst case. So for a chain tree, this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Hmm. So this suggests that the approach is not efficient enough.

Alternative idea: The merged intervals for the union of all U_x for x in the ancestor path of u can be represented as the union of all intervals from U_x for x in the path. Since each U_x is a set of merged intervals, perhaps we can represent this as a collection of intervals that can be efficiently merged.

But I'm not sure how to do this.

Another observation: The in-time of each node is unique. So the subtree ranges are intervals that may overlap or be nested.

Suppose we process the tree from the root down. For each node u, the ancestors are processed before u. So, for example, if we can keep track of the merged intervals for all ancestors up to u's parent, then adding u's own U_u's intervals (if any) might allow us to compute the merged intervals incrementally.

But again, this would require O(n) storage per node, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, we can model the coverage for each node u as the union of the coverage of its parent and U_u. But this isn't correct, since u's ancestors include the parent's ancestors plus the parent. So the coverage of u would be the union of the parent's coverage and U_u's intervals. However, this might not be the case, as the parent's coverage is the union of U_x for x up to the parent's ancestors. Adding U_u's intervals (which are for x=u) is part of the coverage, but only if u is an ancestor of u, which it is.

Wait, perhaps the coverage for u is the coverage of its parent plus the U_u's intervals. But u's parent's coverage already includes all U_x for x up to the parent's ancestors. Since u's ancestors are the parent's ancestors plus the parent, then the coverage for u is the parent's coverage plus U_u's intervals. But this is only true if the parent's coverage includes all ancestors of the parent. But that's the case. Because the parent's coverage is the union of all U_x for x in the path from root to parent. Then, adding U_u (if u is a child of the parent) would not be part of the parent's path. Wait, no. Because u's ancestors are the parent's ancestors plus the parent. So the coverage for u is the coverage of the parent (which is the union of U_x for x from root to parent) plus the U_parent's intervals (wait, no. The parent's coverage includes all U_x for x in root to parent. Then, u's coverage is those same U_x's plus U_u's intervals if u is in their path. No, that's not right. Wait, the coverage for u is the union of all U_x where x is in the path from root to u. The path from root to u is the path from root to parent plus u. So the coverage for u is the coverage of the parent plus U_u. So if we can compute for each node u, the merged intervals of parent's merged intervals plus U_u's intervals, then this could be done in O(1) time per node if we can merge intervals efficiently.

But this approach assumes that the parent's coverage is computed before the child's. Since the tree is a rooted tree, this can be done with a post-order traversal or something similar.

But merging intervals is an expensive operation. Each U_u can have multiple intervals, and merging them with the parent's intervals could take O(k) time where k is the number of intervals. For 1e5 nodes, each with O(1) intervals, this might be manageable.

But how to represent the merged intervals for each node.

Alternatively, we can precompute for each node u, the merged intervals of all U_x's for x in the path from root to u, and store them as a list of intervals. Then, the size of the coverage is the sum of the lengths of these intervals.

But for each u, this merged list would be the parent's merged list plus the intervals from U_u. So, during a traversal of the tree, we can compute the merged list for u based on the parent's merged list and U_u's intervals.

But this approach would require O(n) intervals in total, which may be feasible.

For example, if each U_x contributes a few intervals (say, up to 2 per x), then the merged intervals for a path of length k would have O(k) intervals. But in the worst case, this could be O(n) per node, leading to O(n^2) time and space, which is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is not suitable.

Another Idea: Instead of considering all ancestors, perhaps we can find that for a node u, the U_x's intervals for x in the ancestor path can be merged into a single interval covering all possible ranges. But this is only possible if the intervals are nested, which they are not.

Alternatively, note that the in-time ranges of ancestors of u are nested. For example, the root's interval includes all nodes, and each child's interval is a subset of its parent's interval. So the in-time ranges of ancestors form a chain of nested intervals.

So for each node x in the ancestor path of u, the subtree of x includes u, so their in[x] <= in[u] <= out[x].

But the U_x's intervals can include other ranges not nested.

But perhaps the intervals from U_x for x in the ancestor path can be merged into a single interval. But this is unlikely.

Alternative Idea: The merged coverage intervals for u can be the entire in-time range, but that's only possible if all nodes are covered. But that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but for example, if the coverage includes the root's subtree (which is all nodes), then the merged intervals would be [1, n]. So any u whose ancestor path includes a node x that has a U_x covering the entire tree would have coverage of size n.

But this depends on the operations.

So, perhaps for each node u, the coverage is the entire tree if any of its ancestors' U_x includes the entire tree. Otherwise, it's a combination of some ranges.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, precompute for each node x whether any of the U_x intervals covers the entire tree. If so, then for any u in x's subtree, their coverage includes the entire tree, so their c_u is n-1.

But this is a possible optimization. For example, if during processing, we find that a node x has a U_x that includes the entire tree (like [1, n]), then any u in x's subtree would have coverage including the entire tree. So their c_u would be n-1.

But how to check this.

Alternatively, for each x, we can compute whether the merged U_x covers [1, n]. Then, during the processing of u's ancestors, if any x in the path has U_x covering [1, n], then u's coverage is [1, n], size n. Otherwise, we need to compute the union of all U_x's.

But how to precompute for each x whether U_x covers the entire tree.

If any of the S_i's in x's U_x covers the entire tree, then U_x includes that S_i's ranges. So for x's U_x to cover the entire tree, there must be at least one S_i in x's U_x that includes [1, n].

But S_i is the union of ai's and bi's subtrees. So S_i covers the entire tree if either ai's subtree is the entire tree (ai is the root) or bi's subtree is the entire tree (bi is the root), or their combined subtrees cover the entire tree.

But this is complicated.

Alternatively, during the merging of intervals for U_x, we can check if the merged intervals include [1, n]. If yes, then U_x covers the entire tree.

So for each x, U_x can be either covering the entire tree or not. If any ancestor of u's has U_x covering the entire tree, then u's coverage is the entire tree.

So, during processing, for each node u, we can check if any of their ancestors x has U_x covering the entire tree. If yes, then the coverage size is n. Otherwise, compute the merged intervals.

This could save us from having to process intervals for u's where some ancestor has full coverage.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute in-time and out-time for each node.

2. For each operation i, process ai and bi:

   a. For x = ai: add the intervals [in[ai], out[ai]] and [in[bi], out[bi]] to U_x.

   b. For x = bi: add the same intervals to U_x.

3. For each x, merge the intervals in U_x and check if they cover [1, n]. If yes, mark x as covering the entire tree.

4. For each node u, traverse the ancestor path from u to root. If any ancestor x has U_x covering the entire tree, then u's coverage size is n. Otherwise, compute the union of all U_x intervals for x in the ancestor path and calculate the coverage size.

But even with this optimization, for nodes u where no ancestor x has U_x covering the entire tree, we need to compute the union of all U_x's intervals from the ancestor path. This could still be expensive.

But perhaps the number of such nodes is small, or the intervals are manageable.

Now, the challenge is to compute for each u, the merged intervals from all ancestor U_x's.

Another Idea: For each node u, collect all the intervals from all U_x's in the ancestor path. Then, merge them once. The merged intervals can be computed using a line sweep algorithm.

But for 1e5 nodes, each with O(1) intervals, this could be O(n) total intervals. Merging them for each u would take O(k log k) time per u, where k is the number of intervals. For n=1e5, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since the intervals are sorted in the in-time order, perhaps we can precompute for each node u a list of all intervals from all ancestor U_x's, and then merge them into a list of non-overlapping intervals. But again, this is time-consuming.

Another Idea: Let's precompute for each node x, the merged intervals of U_x. Then, during the traversal of the tree, for each node u, we can maintain a data structure that tracks the merged intervals from the ancestor path. As we move down the tree, when visiting a child u, we can add the U_u's intervals to the data structure and merge them.

But how to do this efficiently.

Imagine a recursive DFS traversal. For each node, we inherit the merged intervals from its parent, add the U_x intervals of the current node, merge them, compute the coverage size, and then proceed to children.

But the merging process for each node would require adding the U_x's intervals to the parent's merged intervals and merging them.

But for each node, the merged intervals of the parent are known. So when processing a node u, we take the parent's merged intervals and add the intervals from U_u. We then merge these intervals and store them as the merged intervals for u.

If we can do this efficiently, then the coverage size for u is the sum of the merged intervals.

But merging intervals is an O(k) operation, where k is the number of intervals. In the worst case, this is O(n) per node, leading to O(n^2) time.

But perhaps with the optimization that once an ancestor x has U_x covering the entire tree, then all descendants of x will have coverage size n.

So during the traversal, if the parent's merged intervals already cover the entire tree, then u's merged intervals are the same as the parent's, and no processing is needed.

This way, we can avoid processing nodes where the coverage is already full.

This could significantly reduce the number of nodes that need to be processed for interval merging.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Precompute in-time and out-time via DFS.

2. For each operation i, add the two intervals (ai's and bi's) to U_ai and U_bi.

3. For each x, merge U_x's intervals and check if it covers [1, n].

4. Perform a DFS traversal of the tree. For each node u:

   a. If u is the root, start with empty intervals.

   b. Else, take the merged intervals from the parent.

   c. If the parent's merged intervals cover [1, n], then u's merged intervals are also [1, n], coverage size n.

   d. Else, add the merged intervals of U_u to the parent's intervals, merge them, and compute the coverage size.

   e. If after adding U_u's intervals, the merged intervals cover [1, n], mark it as such.

   f. The coverage size for u is the sum of the merged intervals' lengths.

5. Subtract 1 from each coverage size to get c_u.

This approach reduces the problem to maintaining merged intervals during the traversal, adding U_u's intervals only when necessary.

Now, the challenge is to efficiently merge the parent's intervals with the U_u's intervals.

For example, if the parent's merged intervals are a list of non-overlapping, sorted intervals, and U_u's merged intervals are another list, we can merge the two lists into a new list of merged intervals.

But merging two lists of intervals can be done in O(a + b) time, where a and b are the number of intervals in each list.

If each U_x has a small number of intervals (like up to 2), then the merging process is manageable.

But for nodes deep in the tree, the merged intervals could accumulate many intervals. However, if after merging the parent's intervals with U_u's intervals, the merged intervals cover the entire range [1, n], then further processing can be skipped for all descendants.

This could significantly reduce the depth of processing.

But how likely is this to happen in practice? It depends on the input operations. If there are many operations involving ancestors of a node, their U_x's could cover the entire tree.

But in any case, this approach seems feasible.

Now, the plan is:

Implement the DFS traversal, maintaining for each node the merged intervals of all ancestor U_x's.

If during any step the merged intervals cover [1, n], the coverage size is n.

Otherwise, compute the size by summing the intervals.

Implement this in Python.

But how to manage the intervals efficiently.

First, during the preprocessing step:

For each x, merge the intervals in U_x. Each U_x is the collection of intervals from all operations where x is ai or bi. Each such operation contributes two intervals: ai's subtree and bi's subtree.

So for each x, we collect all these intervals, merge them into a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals.

Then, during the DFS traversal, for each node u, we take the merged intervals from the parent, add the U_u's merged intervals, merge them again, and compute the size.

But merging two lists of intervals is manageable.

But merging parent's intervals and U_u's intervals can be done as follows:

Take all intervals from the parent's merged intervals and U_u's merged intervals, combine them into a single list, sort them by start time, then merge overlapping or adjacent intervals.

This can be done with a simple line sweep.

But for each node, this could take O(k) time, where k is the number of intervals from the parent and U_u.

But if U_u's merged intervals are up to 2, and the parent's intervals are up to a small number, this could be manageable.

Now, let's think about the data structures.

We can represent merged intervals as a list of tuples (start, end), sorted by start.

For example, the merged intervals for U_x can be stored as a list sorted by start.

Then, during the traversal, the merged intervals for the parent and U_u's merged intervals are merged into a new list.

But for each node, we need to create a new merged list, which is O(k) in time and space. However, if the parent's merged list is already merged and sorted, and U_u's merged list is also merged and sorted, then merging them can be done in O(a + b) time.

For example:

def merge_intervals(a, b):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(a) or j < len(b):
        if j >= len(b) or (i < len(a) and a[i][0] < b[j][0]):
            current = a[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            current = b[j]
            j += 1
        if not merged:
            merged.append(current)
        else:
            last = merged[-1]
            if current[0] <= last[1]:
                merged[-1] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))
            else:
                merged.append(current)
    return merged

But this code merges two sorted lists of intervals. It works if both a and b are sorted and merged.

So for each node u, during the traversal:

if the parent's coverage is full (merged intervals is [(1, n)]), then u's coverage is also full.

Otherwise:

merged_parent = parent's merged intervals
merged_u = merged intervals of U_u's intervals.

merged = merge(merged_parent, merged_u)

compute the sum of merged's intervals' lengths.

If merged covers [1, n], then all descendants of u will have coverage size n.

So in the traversal, once merged becomes [(1, n)], we can mark that all descendants of u have coverage size n.

But how to check if merged covers [1, n].

We can check if the merged intervals are a single interval (1, n). Or sum their lengths.

But in practice, during the merge process, we can check if the merged intervals start at 1 and end at n.

Now, the steps are:

For each node u during DFS:

1. If u is the root:

   a. merged = merged intervals of U_root.

   b. if merged covers [1, n], then coverage size is n. Else, sum the intervals.

2. Else:

   a. if parent's merged covers [1, n], then merged is same as parent's.

   b. else, merged is the merge of parent's merged and U_u's merged intervals.

   c. check if merged covers [1, n].

3. Compute coverage size.

4. Store coverage size for u.

Now, the problem is how to precompute the U_x's merged intervals.

But first, for each x, collect all intervals from operations where x is ai or bi. Then merge them into non-overlapping intervals.

For example, for each x:

intervals = []
for each operation where x is ai or bi:
   intervals.append( [in[ai], out[ai]] )
   intervals.append( [in[bi], out[bi]] )

Then, merge these intervals into non-overlapping intervals.

Merging intervals can be done by sorting them and then merging overlapping or adjacent intervals.

So, for each x:

sort the intervals by start.

merged = []
for interval in sorted(intervals):
    if not merged:
        merged.append(interval)
    else:
        last = merged[-1]
        if interval[0] <= last[1]:
            merged[-1] = (last[0], max(last[1], interval[1]))
        else:
            merged.append(interval)

Then, check if merged covers [1, n].

Once we have the merged intervals for all x, we can proceed with the DFS traversal.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

Implementing this in Python:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read n-1 edges and build the tree.

3. Perform a DFS to compute in and out times for each node.

4. Read m operations (ai, bi). For each operation, add the in and out intervals for ai and bi to their respective U_ai and U_bi.

5. For each x, merge the intervals in U_x and check if they cover [1, n].

6. Perform a DFS traversal, maintaining the merged intervals for each node.

7. For each node, compute the coverage size, subtract 1, and output the results.

But implementing this requires careful handling of the intervals and the DFS traversal.

Now, code steps:

First, building the tree. Since the tree is undirected, but we need to root it at 1, we can build an adjacency list and perform a parent-based DFS to assign in and out times.

Then, for each operation, add the intervals for ai and bi to U_ai and U_bi.

Once all operations are processed, merge the intervals for each U_x.

During the DFS traversal for coverage calculation:

We can use a recursive or iterative approach. However, for large n (up to 1e5), a recursive DFS may hit stack limits. So an iterative approach is better.

For each node u, during the traversal:

- If u is 1 (root), merged is U_1's merged intervals.

- Else, if the parent's merged intervals cover [1, n], then u's merged intervals are the same.

- Else, merge the parent's merged intervals with U_u's merged intervals.

- Check if the merged intervals cover [1, n].

- Compute the coverage size as the sum of the merged intervals' lengths.

- Subtract 1 to get c_u.

But how to represent the merged intervals efficiently.

Each merged interval list can be stored as a list of tuples (start, end). For each node, during traversal, we can create a new list by merging the parent's list and U_u's list.

But this would require O(k) memory per node, which may be acceptable if k is small.

But for large k, this may use too much memory.

Alternative Idea: Since during the traversal, once a node's merged intervals cover [1, n], all descendants can be marked as having coverage n. This can significantly reduce the number of intervals we need to process.

So, during the traversal, we can track a boolean flag indicating whether the current merged intervals cover [1, n]. If yes, then all descendants can be processed in O(1) time.

So, for each node, during the traversal, we can store:

- a boolean flag 'full' indicating whether coverage is full.

- if not full, the merged intervals list and the coverage size.

But for code efficiency, it's better to compute the coverage size during traversal and store it.

So, during the traversal:

For each node u:

if parent's coverage is full:

   u's coverage is full (n).

else:

   merged = merge parent's merged intervals and U_u's merged intervals.

   check if merged covers [1, n].

   if yes:

       u's coverage is n.

   else:

       compute coverage size as sum of merged intervals.

So, the code can proceed as follows:

We'll use an iterative DFS:

stack = [(1, None, None)]  # (current node, parent, parent's merged intervals and full flag)

While stack is not empty:

   pop (u, parent, parent_data)

   if parent is None:  # root

       merged = U_1's merged intervals

       full = does merged cover [1, n]?

       coverage_size = n if full else sum of merged intervals.

   else:

       if parent_data.full:

           merged = None

           full = True

           coverage_size = n

       else:

           merged = merge(parent_data.merged, U_u.merged)

           full = check if merged covers [1, n]

           coverage_size = n if full else sum(merged)

   store coverage_size - 1 as the answer for u.

   for each child v of u:

       push (v, u, {'full': full, 'merged': merged})

But this requires storing for each node the merged intervals and full flag to pass to the children.

But for large n, storing the merged intervals for each node may be memory-intensive.

So, perhaps we can compute the merged intervals during the traversal and pass them to the children, but only if necessary.

But in Python, with the constraints of 256MB memory, storing merged intervals for all nodes may not be feasible. For example, if each node has 2 intervals on average, and there are 1e5 nodes, that's 2e5 tuples of 2 integers each, which is about 1.6MB (each tuple being 8 bytes). That's manageable.

But if in the worst case, each node has 1e5 intervals, this would require 8e5 * 1e5 = 8e9 bytes, which is 8GB, which is impossible.

Thus, this approach is only feasible if the merged intervals per node are small.

But given the optimization that once a node's merged intervals cover the entire tree, all descendants can be processed quickly, it's likely that the merged intervals lists are small for most nodes.

Thus, proceeding with this approach.

Now, let's outline the code:

First, read the input and build the tree.

Then, compute in and out times using a DFS.

Then, for each operation, add the intervals to U_ai and U_bi.

Then, merge the intervals for each U_x.

Then, perform the iterative DFS to compute the coverage size for each node.

But let's think about the data structures for U_x.

Each U_x will be a list of merged intervals.

Now, code:

Implement the in and out times.

Building the tree:

We can represent the tree as an adjacency list, and perform a DFS to assign in and out times.

Then, for each operation i, process ai and bi, adding their intervals to U_ai and U_bi.

Then, merge the intervals for each x's U_x.

Then, for each x, check if the merged intervals cover [1, n].

Then, during the DFS traversal:

For each node u, during the traversal, merge the parent's merged intervals with U_u's intervals.

But in Python, lists are passed by reference, but during the merging, new lists are created.

But during the iterative DFS, for each node, we need to pass the merged intervals from the parent.

So, during the traversal, for each node, after processing it, we store the merged intervals and full flag, and then process the children.

But storing the merged intervals for each node may be necessary.

But for large n, this could be a problem. However, given the constraints of the problem, it's manageable.

But let's think of the code.

The code steps:

Read n and m.

Read n-1 edges and build the adjacency list.

Perform a DFS to compute in and out times.

Read m operations, for each ai and bi:

   add to U_ai's list: [in[ai], out[ai]] and [in[bi], out[bi]]

   add to U_bi's list: [in[ai], out[ai]] and [in[bi], out[bi]]

For each x in 1..n:

   merge the intervals in U_x's list.

   check if merged intervals cover [1, n]. Store this as a boolean.

Then, perform the iterative DFS to compute for each node u:

   if parent's coverage is full:

       coverage_size = n

   else:

       merged = merge(parent's merged intervals with U_u's merged intervals)

       check if merged covers [1, n]. If yes, coverage_size = n.

       else, compute coverage_size as sum of intervals.

   answer[u] = coverage_size - 1

But how to represent the merged intervals for each node during the traversal.

For each node, during the traversal, we need to carry forward the merged intervals from the parent and merge with U_u's merged intervals.

But merging two lists of intervals can be done as follows.

But in code, for each x, we have already merged the intervals for U_x.

So U_x's merged intervals are stored as a list of tuples.

Then, during the traversal, for each node u:

parent_merged = parent's merged intervals.

u_merged = U_u's merged intervals.

merged = merge(parent_merged, u_merged)

Thus, the merge function must take two lists of merged intervals and return a new merged list.

But how to implement this.

The merge function for two sorted, merged lists.

For example, parent_merged and u_merged are both lists of intervals sorted by start.

Merge them into a single sorted, merged list.

This can be done by:

def merge(a, b):

    i = j = 0

    merged = []

    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):

        if a[i][0] < b[j][0]:

            add a[i] to merged, increment i

        else:

            add b[j] to merged, increment j

        # merge overlapping intervals

        while len(merged) >= 2:

            last = merged[-2]

            current = merged[-1]

            if current[0] <= last[1]:

                merged[-2] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))

                merged.pop()

            else:

                break

    # add remaining intervals

    while i < len(a):

        add a[i] to merged, increment i

        # merge as above

        while len(merged) >= 2:

            last = merged[-2]

            current = merged[-1]

            if current[0] <= last[1]:

                merged[-2] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))

                merged.pop()

            else:

                break

    while j < len(b):

        add b[j] to merged, increment j

        while len(merged) >= 2:

            last = merged[-2]

            current = merged[-1]

            if current[0] <= last[1]:

                merged[-2] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))

                merged.pop()

            else:

                break

    return merged

But this function merges two merged lists into one.

Alternatively, we can concatenate the two lists, sort them by start, and then merge overlapping intervals.

But this is O(k log k) time, which may be acceptable.

But for code efficiency, perhaps this approach is better:

def merge(a, b):

    merged = a + b

    merged.sort()

    result = []

    for interval in merged:

        if not result:

            result.append(interval)

        else:

            last = result[-1]

            if interval[0] <= last[1]:

                result[-1] = (last[0], max(last[1], interval[1]))

            else:

                result.append(interval)

    return result

This function merges two lists of intervals by concatenating them, sorting by start, and then merging overlapping intervals.

This approach is O((a + b) log (a + b)) time for each merge, but for small a and b, it's manageable.

But if a and b are large, this could be slow.

But given that the merged intervals for each U_x are already merged, and during the traversal, a is the parent's merged intervals and b is the U_u's merged intervals, which are merged, then the merged list can be created by merging the two sorted lists in linear time.

But perhaps the code would be simpler to sort again, even if it's O(k log k) time.

But for code simplicity, we can use the second approach.

Now, putting this all together.

But now, the code is getting complicated, but let's try to write it.

First, read the input.

Read n and m.

Then, build the tree.

Then, compute in and out times.

Then, process the m operations.

Then, merge the intervals for each x.

Then, perform the iterative DFS.

But handling the tree's children is important. Since the tree is undirected, during the DFS traversal, we need to track the parent to avoid revisiting.

So, code for building the tree and computing in and out times:

import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)

n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for _ in range(n-1):

    u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    adj[u].append(v)

    adj[v].append(u)

in_time = [0] * (n+1)

out_time = [0] * (n+1)

time = 1

stack = [(1, False, -1)]

while stack:

    node, visited, parent = stack.pop()

    if visited:

        out_time[node] = time

        time += 1

    else:

        in_time[node] = time

        time += 1

        # Push children in reverse order to process them in order

        stack.append( (node, True, parent) )

        children = [child for child in adj[node] if child != parent]

        children.sort(reverse=True)

        for child in children:

            stack.append( (child, False, node) )

This is an iterative DFS to compute in and out times.

Now, process the m operations.

U = [ [] for _ in range(n+1) ]

for _ in range(m):

    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    a_in = in_time[a]

    a_out = out_time[a]

    b_in = in_time[b]

    b_out = out_time[b]

    # Add to a's U

    U[a].append( (a_in, a_out) )

    U[a].append( (b_in, b_out) )

    # Add to b's U

    U[b].append( (a_in, a_out) )

    U[b].append( (b_in, b_out) )

Now, merge the intervals for each x's U and check if they cover [1, n].

merged_intervals = [ [] for _ in range(n+1) ]

full_coverage = [False] * (n+1)

for x in range(1, n+1):

    intervals = U[x]

    # Merge intervals

    if not intervals:

        merged = []

    else:

        intervals.sort()

        merged = []

        current_start, current_end = intervals[0]

        for s, e in intervals[1:]:

            if s <= current_end:

                current_end = max(current_end, e)

            else:

                merged.append( (current_start, current_end) )

                current_start, current_end = s, e

        merged.append( (current_start, current_end) )

    merged_intervals[x] = merged

    # Check if covers [1, n]

    if merged:

        if merged[0][0] == 1 and merged[-1][1] == in_time[n] and len(merged) == 1:

            full_coverage[x] = True

    # Note: in_time[n] is the maximum in_time, but out_time[1] = n*2. Wait, no.

    # Wait, in the in_time computation, each node is visited once, in_time and out_time are assigned.

    # The root's subtree (node 1) has in_time 1 and out_time 2n-1.

    # So, the entire tree's in_time ranges from 1 to out_time[1], which is 2n-1.

    # So, the entire tree is covered by an interval [1, out_time[1]].

    # So, the coverage is full if the merged intervals include [1, out_time[1]].

    # So, the code above checks for [1, in_time[n]] which is incorrect.

    # Need to check if the merged intervals cover [1, out_time[1]].

    # So, the correct full coverage check is:

    if merged and merged[0][0] <= 1 and merged[-1][1] >= out_time[1]:

        # Check if the merged intervals cover the entire range.

        current_end = merged[0][1]

        if current_end < merged[0][0]:

            current_end = merged[0][1]

        if merged[0][0] > 1:

            full_coverage[x] = False

            continue

        for i in range(1, len(merged)):

            if merged[i][0] > current_end:

                break

            current_end = max(current_end, merged[i][1])

        if current_end >= out_time[1]:

            full_coverage[x] = True

        else:

            full_coverage[x] = False

    else:

        full_coverage[x] = False

This part needs to check whether the merged intervals for x cover the entire in-time range of the tree.

But out_time[1] is the maximum in-time.

But the root's out_time is 2n-1 (assuming a standard DFS traversal where each node is visited once for in_time and once for out_time).

So, the entire tree is represented by the in_time range [1, out_time[1]].

So, for x's merged intervals to cover the entire tree, their merged intervals must include [1, out_time[1]].

The code above attempts to check this but may have bugs.

Alternatively, after merging the intervals for x, we can compute the total length of the merged intervals and see if it's equal to out_time[1] - 1 + 1 (the total number of nodes).

But no, because each node's in_time is unique. The total number of nodes is n, so the in_time ranges from 1 to 2n-1. So the entire tree's in_time range is [1, out_time[1]], which is length out_time[1] -1 + 1 = out_time[1]. But out_time[1] is 2n-1 for a tree with n nodes.

But the total number of nodes is n, so the actual length of the entire tree is out_time[1] - in_time[1] + 1 = (2n-1) - 1 + 1 = 2n-1 nodes. Which is not correct. So there's a mistake here.

Ah, right, the in_time and out_time are assigned using a pre-order traversal. For example, for a tree with root 1 and two children 2 and 3:

- in_time[1] = 1

- in_time[2] = 2, out_time[2] = 3

- in_time[3] = 4, out_time[3] = 5

- out_time[1] = 5

So the root's subtree is from in_time 1 to out_time 5.

The total number of nodes is 3, but the in_time and out_time for the root is 1 and 5. So the length is 5-1+1 =5.

But the actual number of nodes is 3. So the in_time and out_time do not directly correspond to the number of nodes.

But the entire tree's range is [1, out_time[1]].

Thus, the correct way to check if merged intervals cover the entire tree is if the merged intervals start at <= 1 and end >= out_time[1], and cover all in between.

But this is complicated to check. Perhaps, after merging the intervals for x, the code can compute the total covered length and check if it's equal to out_time[1] - 1 + 1.

But since the in_time ranges are contiguous for the entire tree, the merged intervals must form a single interval [1, out_time[1]].

So, the code for full_coverage[x] can be:

full_coverage[x] = (len(merged) == 1 and merged[0][0] == 1 and merged[0][1] == out_time[1])

But this may not catch all cases where merged intervals cover the entire tree. For example, merged could be [ (1, 3), (4, 5) ] but the entire tree's out_time is 5. This merged intervals would not cover the entire tree.

Thus, the correct check is:

merged covers [1, out_time[1]] completely.

To check this:

current_end = 0

for interval in merged:

    start, end = interval

    if start > current_end + 1:

        break

    current_end = max(current_end, end)

full_coverage[x] = (current_end >= out_time[1])

So, after merging the intervals for x, we check if the merged intervals cover the entire [1, out_time[1]] range.

Thus, code:

if not merged:

    full_coverage[x] = False

else:

    current_end = merged[0][1]

    if merged[0][0] > 1:

        full_coverage[x] = False

    else:

        for i in range(1, len(merged)):

            if merged[i][0] > current_end + 1:

                break

            current_end = max(current_end, merged[i][1])

        full_coverage[x] = (current_end >= out_time[1])

But this is complex. Alternatively, after merging, compute the coverage as sum of (end - start + 1) for each interval, and check if it equals out_time[1] (the total in_time range size).

But the in_time range size is out_time[1], but the sum of the merged intervals' coverage may not equal that. For example, merged intervals may have overlapping regions.

So this approach is not correct.

Thus, the correct way is to check whether the merged intervals cover the entire [1, out_time[1]] interval.

Thus, the code for full_coverage[x] would be:

current_end = 0

full = False

for start, end in merged:

    if start > current_end + 1:

        break

    current_end = max(current_end, end)

    if current_end >= out_time[1]:

        full = True

        break

full_coverage[x] = full

This way, for each interval in merged, we check if they cover from 1 to out_time[1].

Thus, the code for full_coverage[x] is:

if merged:

    current_end = 0

    full = False

    for start, end in merged:

        if start > current_end + 1:

            break

        current_end = max(current_end, end)

        if current_end >= out_time[1]:

            full = True

            break

    full_coverage[x] = full

else:

    full_coverage[x] = False

But this may miss cases where merged intervals start after 1. So we need to ensure that the first interval starts at or before 1.

Thus, modified code:

if merged:

    if merged[0][0] > 1:

        full_coverage[x] = False

    else:

        current_end = merged[0][1]

        if current_end >= out_time[1]:

            full_coverage[x] = True

        else:

            for start, end in merged[1:]:

                if start > current_end + 1:

                    break

                current_end = max(current_end, end)

                if current_end >= out_time[1]:

                    break

            full_coverage[x] = (current_end >= out_time[1])

else:

    full_coverage[x] = False

This code checks if the merged intervals start at or before 1 and extend to at least out_time[1].

Now, after merging the intervals for each x and checking full coverage, we can proceed.

Next step: perform the iterative DFS to compute coverage sizes.

We'll need to track for each node whether the merged intervals cover the entire tree (full) and, if not, the merged intervals and their size.

But during the traversal, for each node, we can track:

- full: whether the coverage is full.

- merged_intervals: the merged intervals (if not full).

We can represent this with a dictionary or a list of objects.

But in Python, using a stack for iterative DFS:

stack = [ (1, None, False, []) ]

answer = [0] * (n+1)

while stack:

    u, parent, parent_full, parent_merged = stack.pop()

    # Compute merged intervals for u

    if parent is None:

        # root

        u_merged = merged_intervals[1]

        u_full = full_coverage[1]

    else:

        if parent_full:

            u_full = True

            u_merged = []

        else:

            # merge parent_merged and merged_intervals[u]

            combined = parent_merged + merged_intervals[u]

            combined.sort()

            # merge overlapping intervals

            merged = []

            for start, end in combined:

                if not merged:

                    merged.append( (start, end) )

                else:

                    last_start, last_end = merged[-1]

                    if start <= last_end:

                        merged[-1] = (last_start, max(last_end, end))

                    else:

                        merged.append( (start, end) )

            # check if merged covers [1, out_time[1]]

            current_end = 0

            u_full = False

            if merged:

                if merged[0][0] > 1:

                    pass

                else:

                    current_end = merged[0][1]

                    if current_end >= out_time[1]:

                        u_full = True

                    else:

                        for s, e in merged[1:]:

                            if s > current_end + 1:

                                break

                            current_end = max(current_end, e)

                            if current_end >= out_time[1]:

                                break

                        u_full = (current_end >= out_time[1])

            if u_full:

                u_merged = []

            else:

                u_merged = merged

    # compute coverage size

    if u_full:

        coverage_size = out_time[1]  # out_time[1] is the total nodes' in_time range, but not the count of nodes.

        # Wait, the coverage_size is the number of nodes covered, which is not the same as the sum of (end - start + 1) for the intervals.

        # Oh, no. The in_time and out_time are not contiguous for nodes. So the sum of merged intervals' lengths is not the same as the number of nodes.

        # This is a problem.

        # Wait, the in_time is assigned in a pre-order traversal. The nodes' in_time ranges are not contiguous. Each node's in_time is a unique number, and the subtree of x includes all nodes with in_time between in[x] and out[x].

        # So the number of nodes in a subtree is (out[x] - in[x] + 1) // 2.

        # Or wait, how many nodes are in a subtree x?

        # For example, if x's in_time is 1 and out_time is 5, then the subtree has (5-1+1) =5 in_time units. But in reality, each node contributes 2 units (in and out), so the number of nodes is (5-1)/2 +1 = 3 nodes.

        # So the number of nodes in a subtree is (out[x] - in[x] + 1) // 2.

        # Thus, the coverage_size for the merged intervals is the sum over all intervals of ((e - s + 1) // 2).

        # Wait, this is incorrect.

        # For example, if an interval [s, e] covers in_time of multiple nodes. The number of nodes in this interval is the number of nodes with in_time <= e and out_time >= s. But this is not easily computable.

        # So, the original approach of using in_time ranges to represent the nodes' coverage is incorrect.

        # Oh no! This is a critical mistake.

        # The in_time ranges are used to represent the subtree. But the in_time and out_time are assigned in a way that allows a node's subtree to be represented by [in[x], out[x]], where in[x] is the time when x is first visited, and out[x] is the time when x is exited. Thus, the subtree of x consists of all nodes with in_time between in[x] and out[x], inclusive.

        # Thus, the number of nodes in the subtree of x is (out[x] - in[x] + 1) // 2 + 1. For example, if in[x] = 1 and out[x] = 5, then the nodes in the subtree have in_time 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But these include x and its children, with in and out times. But the actual number of nodes is not directly related to the in_time and out_time difference.

        # So, the approach of using intervals to represent the nodes' coverage is incorrect because the in_time and out_time do not directly correspond to the node count. Instead, the nodes in a subtree x are exactly those with in_time >= in[x] and in_time <= out[x].

        # Thus, the number of nodes covered by a range [s, e] is the number of nodes with in_time between s and e, and out_time >= s.

        # But how to compute this?

        # The correct way to compute the number of nodes covered by a set of intervals is to compute the number of nodes whose in_time is covered by any of the intervals.

        # But how to compute this efficiently.

        # For example, given a list of intervals, how to find the count of nodes whose in_time is within any of the intervals.

        # This is a classic problem of interval coverage. But how to do this quickly.

        # Thus, the original approach of summing the lengths of the merged intervals and subtracting is incorrect.

        # This is a major problem.

        # The initial approach is flawed because the in_time and out_time ranges do not directly correspond to the node counts.

        # Thus, the entire reasoning up to this point is incorrect.

        # This changes everything.

        # The mistake was in assuming that the in_time ranges can be used to represent the nodes' coverage. But in reality, a node is in a subtree if and only if its in_time is between the subtree's root's in_time and out_time.

        # So, when merging intervals, the number of nodes covered is the number of nodes whose in_time falls within any of the merged intervals.

        # But how to compute this number quickly.

        # The problem requires that we compute, for each node u, the number of nodes v such that there exists an operation i where both u and v are in S_i.

        # S_i is the union of the subtrees of ai and bi.

        # The number of nodes in S_i is the number of nodes in ai's subtree plus the number of nodes in bi's subtree minus the number of nodes in the intersection.

        # But this is not directly helpful.

        # So, the correct way to model this is to track the nodes' in_time and compute for each node u the set of nodes v whose in_time is in any of the merged intervals from u's coverage.

        # But how to compute the size of this set.

        # One way is to precompute a prefix sum array of the in_time positions.

        # For example, create a sorted list of all in_time values, and for each merged interval [s, e], compute the number of in_time values that lie within s <= in_time <= e.

        # This can be done using binary search.

        # So, the steps would be:

        1. Collect all in_time values into a sorted list.

        2. For each merged interval [s, e], the number of nodes covered is upper_bound(e) - lower_bound(s).

        But since the in_time values are unique and sorted, this can be done quickly.

        Thus, the code should precompute a sorted list of in_time values.

        Then, during the coverage size computation for a merged interval list, the coverage size is the sum over each interval in the list of the number of nodes whose in_time falls within the interval.

        This is the correct approach.

        This changes everything.

        So, the merged intervals are ranges in the in_time axis. The number of nodes in each interval is the number of in_time values that fall within that interval.

        So, the code must:

        - Precompute a sorted list of in_time values (since they are already in order, perhaps).

        Wait, the in_time is assigned in a pre-order traversal. So the in_time values are ordered in the order of the traversal. So the in_time list is sorted in the order of the traversal, but not necessarily sorted numerically. For example, in a tree with root 1, which has a child 2 and child 3, the in_time could be 1, 2, 4, with out_time 3, 5, 5. So the in_time list for nodes is [1, 2, 4].

        So the in_time values are not sorted in numerical order. Thus, we need to create a list of all in_time values sorted numerically.

        Thus, the steps:

        - Collect all in_time values into a list, and sort them.

        Then, for any interval [s, e], the number of nodes covered is the number of in_time values in the list that are >= s and <= e.

        This can be computed using bisect_left and bisect_right.

        For example:

        import bisect

        sorted_in = sorted(in_time[1: n+1])

        Then, for an interval [s, e], the count is bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e) - bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s).

        So, the coverage size for a merged interval list is the sum of such counts for each interval.

        But this is O(k log n) per merged interval list, which could be expensive for large k.

        But given that the merged intervals are merged and non-overlapping, and sorted, the sum can be computed as follows:

        for each interval in merged:

            cnt += bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e) - bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s)

        This is O(k log n) time per merged interval list.

        But this is manageable for k up to 1e5, as each bisect is O(log n) time.

        Thus, the code must be modified to compute the coverage size using this method.

        This changes the entire approach.

        So, the correct steps are:

        1. Precompute the in_time and out_time for each node.

        2. For each operation, collect the intervals of ai and bi's subtrees.

        3. For each x, merge the intervals of U_x.

        4. Precompute the sorted list of in_time values.

        5. During the DFS traversal:

            a. For each node u, compute the merged intervals of all U_x's from the ancestor path.

            b. For the merged intervals, compute the coverage size as the sum over each interval of the number of in_time values in the interval.

            c. Subtract 1 to account for u itself.

        Thus, the code must be adjusted to use the bisect approach.

        This means that the code for merged intervals and full coverage is no longer sufficient. Instead, during the traversal, for each node's merged intervals, we compute the coverage size using the sorted_in list.

        Also, the full coverage check must be based on whether the merged intervals cover all in_time values.

        But this is difficult, so perhaps the full coverage check can be removed, and we compute the coverage size using the merged intervals.

        Thus, the code needs to be modified as follows:

        sorted_in = sorted(in_time[1:n+1])

        Then, for a merged interval list:

        coverage_size = 0

        for s, e in merged:

            left = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s)

            right = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e)

            coverage_size += right - left

        Thus, this coverage_size is the number of nodes in the merged intervals.

        Then, the answer for u is coverage_size - 1.

        This approach corrects the previous mistake of assuming that the in_time ranges directly represent the node counts.

        Thus, the code must be reworked to use this method.

        Let's outline the code again:

        After building the tree and computing in_time and out_time:

        sorted_in = sorted( [in_time[i] for i in range(1, n+1) ] )

        Then, for each operation i, add ai's and bi's intervals to U_ai and U_bi.

        For each x, merge the intervals in U_x.

        Then, during the DFS traversal:

        For each node u:

            merged = the merged intervals from all ancestor U_x's.

            coverage_size = sum for each interval in merged of the number of in_time in the interval.

            answer[u] = coverage_size - 1.

        So, the key is to compute merged intervals for each u's ancestor path and compute the coverage_size using bisect.

        Thus, the code for merging the intervals is still needed, but the coverage_size computation is based on the bisect method.

        Now, the problem is how to compute the merged intervals during the traversal.

        The previous approach of merging the parent's merged intervals with U_u's merged intervals is still valid, but the full coverage check is no longer necessary. Instead, during the traversal, each node's merged intervals are the merge of the parent's merged intervals and U_u's merged intervals.

        The code can proceed as follows:

        Read n and m.

        Build the tree.

        Compute in_time and out_time.

        sorted_in = sorted(in_time[1: n+1])

        Process m operations:

            for each operation i (ai, bi):

                add ai's interval and bi's interval to U_ai and U_bi.

        For each x:

            merged = merge the intervals in U_x.

            store merged in merged_intervals[x]

        Perform iterative DFS:

            stack = [ (1, None, []) ]

            answer = [0] * (n+1)

            while stack not empty:

                u, parent, parent_merged = stack.pop()

                merged = parent_merged + merged_intervals[u]

                merged = merge(merged)  # merge into non-overlapping, sorted intervals.

                coverage_size = compute using bisect.

                answer[u] = coverage_size - 1

                for each child v of u:

                    stack.append( (v, u, merged) )

        But this approach would create a new merged list for each child, which could be memory-intensive.

        To optimize, during the traversal, we can track the merged intervals for each node and pass them to the children.

        But again, for large merged lists, this is not feasible.

        Thus, the only feasible approach is to compute the merged intervals for each node u as the merge of parent's merged intervals and U_u's merged intervals, and compute the coverage size using bisect.

        But this will be time-consuming for large merged lists.

        However, given the problem constraints, and the optimizations (e.g., merging intervals once for each x), this may be manageable.

        Thus, the code will:

        Precompute merged_intervals for each x.

        During the DFS, for each node u:

            merged = merge of parent_merged and merged_intervals[u]

            compute coverage_size via bisect.

            answer[u] = coverage_size - 1

        But this is O(k) for merging and O(k log n) for coverage_size computation per node.

        For n=1e5 and k=2 per node, this is 2e5 * (merge time + bisect time), which should be manageable.

        Thus, the code can proceed.

        Now, code for merging intervals:

        def merge(intervals):

            if not intervals:

                return []

            intervals.sort()

            merged = [intervals[0]]

            for current in intervals[1:]:

                last = merged[-1]

                if current[0] <= last[1]:

                    merged[-1] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))

                else:

                    merged.append(current)

            return merged

        Then, during the iterative DFS:

        stack = [ (1, []) ]

        answer = [0]*(n+1)

        while stack:

            u, parent_merged = stack.pop()

            # Merge parent_merged with merged_intervals[u]

            merged = merge(parent_merged + merged_intervals[u])

            # Compute coverage_size

            coverage_size = 0

            for s, e in merged:

                left = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s)

                right = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e)

                coverage_size += (right - left)

            answer[u] = coverage_size - 1

            # Push children

            for v in adj[u]:

                if v != parent:

                    stack.append( (v, merged) )

        But how to track the parent in the iterative DFS.

        The code should track the parent to avoid revisiting.

        Thus, the iterative DFS should track the parent and the merged intervals.

        So, the stack entries are tuples of (u, parent, merged_intervals).

        But since the tree is undirected, we need to track the parent to prevent revisiting.

        Thus, the code:

        stack = [ (1, None, []) ]

        answer = [0]*(n+1)

        while stack:

            u, parent, merged_parent = stack.pop()

            # Compute merged_intervals for u

            merged = merged_parent + merged_intervals[u]

            merged = merge(merged)

            # Compute coverage_size

            coverage_size = 0

            for s, e in merged:

                left = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s)

                right = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e)

                coverage_size += (right - left)

            answer[u] = coverage_size - 1

            # Push children to stack

            for v in adj[u]:

                if v != parent:

                    stack.append( (v, u, merged) )

        This way, each child is processed with the merged intervals of the current node.

        But this approach may have time complexity O(n * k), where k is the average number of intervals per node.

        For n=1e5 and k=2, this is O(2e5) merge operations, each O(2) time.

        The bisect operations are O(k log n) per node. For k=2, this is O(2e5 * 2 * log n), which is manageable.

        Thus, this code should work.

        Now, implementing this in Python.

        But for large merged lists, merging may be slow. For example, if each merged list has 100 intervals, merging 1e5 nodes would be O(1e7) operations.

        But given that the in_time ranges are nested (since ancestors' intervals are merged), perhaps the merged intervals for a node's path will be merged into a few intervals.

        But this is not guaranteed.

        However, given the time constraints, this is the best approach.

        Now, the code:

        import sys

        import bisect

        sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)

        n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

        adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

        for _ in range(n-1):

            u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

            adj[u].append(v)

            adj[v].append(u)

        in_time = [0]*(n+1)

        out_time = [0]*(n+1)

        time = 1

        stack = [(1, False, -1)]

        while stack:

            node, visited, parent = stack.pop()

            if visited:

                out_time[node] = time

                time +=1

            else:

                in_time[node] = time

                time +=1

                stack.append( (node, True, parent) )

                # Push children in reverse order to process in order

                children = []

                for v in adj[node]:

                    if v != parent:

                        children.append(v)

                children.sort(reverse=True)

                for v in children:

                    stack.append( (v, False, node) )

        # Precompute sorted_in list

        sorted_in = sorted(in_time[1:n+1])

        # Process m operations

        U = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

        for _ in range(m):

            a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

            a_in = in_time[a]

            a_out = out_time[a]

            b_in = in_time[b]

            b_out = out_time[b]

            # Add to U[a]

            U[a].append( (a_in, a_out) )

            U[a].append( (b_in, b_out) )

            # Add to U[b]

            U[b].append( (a_in, a_out) )

            U[b].append( (b_in, b_out) )

        # Merge intervals for each x

        merged_intervals = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

        for x in range(1, n+1):

            intervals = U[x]

            if not intervals:

                merged_intervals[x] = []

                continue

            intervals.sort()

            current_start, current_end = intervals[0]

            for s, e in intervals[1:]:

                if s <= current_end:

                    current_end = max(current_end, e)

                else:

                    merged.append( (current_start, current_end) )

                    current_start = s

        answer = [0]*(n+1)

        stack = [ (1, None, []) ]

                    merged_result.append(interval)

                else:

                    last_start, last_end = merged_result[-1]

            for s, e in merged_result:

                left = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_in, s)

                right = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_in, e)

        # Output the answer

        print(' '.join(map(str, answer[1:])))

        This code should handle all cases correctly.

        However, there is a problem with the merging of parent_merged and merged_intervals[u]. The code uses merged = parent_merged + merged_intervals[u], then sorts and merges. This is O(k log k) time, where k is the length of the combined list.

        For large k, this may be slow.

        But given the problem constraints and the optimization that intervals are merged once during preprocessing, this should be manageable.

        Let's test this code against the first sample input:

        Sample Input 1:

        5 1

        1 2

        1 3

        3 5

        3 4

        2 3

        The tree is:

        1 is connected to 2 and 3.

        3 is connected to 5 and 4.

        The in_time and out_time would be:

        Let's compute them manually.

        Assuming DFS starts at 1, processes 2 first, then 3, 5, 4.

        in_time:

        1: 1

        2: 2

        3: 4

        5: 5

        4: 6

        out_time:

        2: 3

        5: 6

        4:7

        3: 8

        1: 8

        So, sorted_in = [1,2,4,5,6]

        The operation is (2,3). For this operation:

        ai = 2: in_time is 2, out_time is 3.

        bi =3: in_time is 4, out_time is 8.

        So, U[2] will have intervals (2,3) and (4,8).

        U[3] will also have (2,3) and (4,8).

        So merged_intervals[2] is merged as [(2,3), (4,8)] → merged as [(2,3), (4,8)].

        merged_intervals[3] is merged as [(2,3), (4,8)].

        Now, during the DFS:

        For the root (1):

            parent_merged is empty.

            merged = empty + merged_intervals[1] (which is empty? Because U[1] is empty unless there are operations where ai or bi is 1.

            Oh, wait, in the first sample input, the operation is 2 and 3, so merged_intervals[1] is empty.

            So, merged_result is empty.

            coverage_size is 0.

            answer[1] = -1? But that's impossible. So the code must have a bug.

            Wait, the first sample's operation is (2,3). So for x=2 and x=3, their U_x includes (2,3) and (4,8).

            So for u=2:

                merged_intervals[2] is [(2,3), (4,8)].

                during the traversal for u=2, parent is 1.

                parent_merged is empty.

                merged = empty + merged_intervals[2] → [(2,3), (4,8)].

                coverage_size is the number of nodes in (2,3) and (4,8).

                For (2,3):

                    nodes with in_time >=2 and <=3. The in_time values are 1,2,4,5,6. So nodes 2 (in_time=2), and perhaps others.

                    bisect_left(sorted_in, 2) → 1 (since sorted_in is [1,2,4,5,6]).

                    bisect_right(sorted_in, 3) → 2 (since 3 is between 2 and 4).

                    count is 2-1 =1 (node 2).

                    For (4,8):

                        bisect_left for 4 is 2 (sorted_in[2]=4).

                        bisect_right for 8 is 5.

                        count is 5-2=3 (nodes 4,5,6 in_time 4,5,6).

                        total coverage_size=1+3=4. answer[u]=4-1=3.

                Which matches the sample output for node 2.

            For u=1:

                merged_result is empty. coverage_size=0. answer[1] is -1. But the sample output is 0.

            Wait, this indicates a bug in the code.

            The root node (1) has no merged intervals, so coverage_size is 0, answer is -1. But the sample output is 0.

            So the code is incorrect.

            Why?

            Because in the sample input, the operation is (2,3), which contributes to U_2 and U_3. For node 1, none of the operations have ai or bi as 1. Thus, merged_intervals[1] is empty.

            So during the traversal for node 1:

                merged = parent_merged (empty) + merged_intervals[1] (empty) → empty.

                coverage_size is 0.

                answer[1] = 0-1 = -1. But sample output is 0.

            So this is a problem.

            The error is because the code subtracts 1 from the coverage_size, which includes u itself. But the coverage_size is the number of nodes in the merged intervals. For the root node, merged_intervals is empty, so coverage_size is 0. Thus, answer[1] is -1, but correct answer is 0.

            So the code's logic is incorrect.

            The mistake is that the merged_intervals for u's coverage is the union of all U_x's from the ancestor path. But for u=1, the ancestor path
