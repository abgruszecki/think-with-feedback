<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to maximize the damage by selecting hits from the sequence, but ensuring that we don't press the same button more than k times in a row. And the order of the hits can't be changed. Oh right, and when you skip a hit, the consecutive count doesn't reset. That's important.

Hmm, so for each group of consecutive same characters (like a run of 'a's), we need to select some hits in that group. But within each such run, we can't take more than k consecutive hits. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that if you press the same button more than k times in a row, then it breaks. So the key is that in the selected hits, for any consecutive sequence of the same button, you can't have more than k in a row. So even if the original group is longer than k, but in the selection, you have to split them such that no run exceeds k.

Wait, but the problem statement says that when you skip a hit, the counter doesn't reset. Oh, that's a bit tricky. So the consecutive count is based on the original sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that if you skip a hit, the counter of consecutive presses doesn't reset. So even if you skip a hit, the consecutive count continues. So, for example, if you have a sequence like a a a a (k=2). If you select the first two a's, skip the third, then select the fourth. Then the consecutive presses would be two (first two), then after skipping the third, the fourth is considered as part of the same run? No, wait, the counter is based on the actual consecutive presses in the selected sequence. But the problem says that if you skip a hit, the counter doesn't reset. So the counter is based on the original sequence's order, not the selected ones. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait the problem statement says: "Note that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset."

Ah, right. So the counter for consecutive presses is based on the original sequence. So even if you skip a hit, the consecutive count in the original sequence continues. For example, if you have a sequence like a a a a a with k=2. So in the original sequence, they are all consecutive. But if you select the first two and the fourth, then between the second and fourth, there was a hit (third) that you skipped. So the original consecutive a's are 5. But when you select some hits, the skipped hits don't reset the counter. So the consecutive presses in the selection would be the first two, then the fourth. But since the original third is skipped, the fourth's consecutive count is considered as part of the original run, so the consecutive presses would be 3 (since in the original sequence, the fourth a is the fourth consecutive). Wait, no. The problem says that the counter of consecutive presses is for the selected hits. Wait, no, the problem's note is a bit confusing.

Wait the note says: "Note that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset." So for example, if you have a sequence of s = "aaaaa" and k=3. Suppose you select hits 1, 2, 4. Then the selected sequence is a, a, a (hits 1,2,4). But between 2 and 4, there's hit 3 which was skipped. So the counter for the button 'a' would see hit 1 (count 1), hit 2 (count 2), hit 4 (count 3). Because even though hit 3 was skipped, the original consecutive sequence is a a a a a. So when you select hit 4 after skipping hit 3, the consecutive count is considered as part of the original run. So in the selected hits, the consecutive presses would be 3 (since hits 1,2,4 are selected, but in the original run, they are consecutive. So the selected hits are 1,2,4: the 4th hit in the original run is part of the same consecutive group as the first two. So the selected hits form a run where the consecutive presses in the original sequence are part of a longer run, but the problem says that the counter is based on the actual selected hits. Wait, but the note says that skipping a hit doesn't reset the counter. So that the consecutive presses in the original sequence, even if skipped, still contribute to the counter. So the counter is based on the original sequence's consecutive presses, not the selected ones. So, for example, if the original sequence is a a a a a, and you select hits 1,2,3,4,5, then that's 5 consecutive presses and would break the button. But if k=3, you can't select more than 3. But if the original sequence has a group of 5 a's, and you select the first 3, then skip the fourth and fifth, then that's allowed. But if you select hits 1,2,3, then 4 (after skipping 3?), wait no. Wait in the original group, they are all a's. So in that group, any hits you select must not have a consecutive run longer than k. But how to model this.

Alternatively, the problem is that when you select some hits from a group of same characters (like a run of 'a's), you can't have a subsequence where the original indices are consecutive and you have more than k selected. Because each time you select a hit in the original run, the consecutive presses would be based on the original positions. So even if you skip some hits in between, the original positions are consecutive, so selecting those would count as consecutive presses. Wait, no. Because for example, in the original sequence of a a a a a (indices 1-5), if you select 1,3,5, then in the original sequence, between 1 and 3 there's a hit 2 which was skipped, but in the original, 1 and 3 are not consecutive. So the consecutive presses in the selected sequence would be 1,3,5. Each of them is not consecutive in the original run. So the button presses in the selected sequence are not consecutive in the original, so each button press in the selected sequence is considered as a separate run. But according to the note, if you skip a hit, the counter doesn't reset. So this is the crux of the problem.

Wait, the note says that the counter of consecutive presses doesn't reset when you skip a hit. So the counter is based on the original sequence. For example, if you have a run of a a a a a (original 5 in a row), and you select the first, third, and fifth hits. Then the selected hits are first, third, fifth. But in the original sequence, the first and third are separated by a skipped hit (second). So the original consecutive run is 5. So when you select these hits, how does the counter work?

The problem's note says that skipping a hit (like the second) doesn't reset the counter. So when you select the first a, the count is 1. Then the second a is skipped, but the counter is not reset. Then the third a is selected: the consecutive count would be 3, because the third hit in the original run is the third consecutive a. So even though you skipped the second hit, the third hit's consecutive count is 3. So in this case, if k is 2, then selecting the third hit would not be allowed, because the consecutive count would be 3 (since the original run is a a a a a, and selecting hit 3 would be part of a run that started at hit 1, but hit 2 was skipped. So the consecutive count here is 3? Because in the original run, the third hit is part of a consecutive run of 5, but when you select hit 1 and hit 3, the consecutive count for hit 3 is 3 (since the original sequence's consecutive a's are 1,2,3,4,5). So even if you skip some in between, the consecutive count for the selected hits is based on their original positions. So for the purpose of the counter, the consecutive presses in the original run are considered, not the selected ones.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's re-express the note. The note says that if you skip a hit, the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset. So, for example, if the original sequence is a a a a a (five a's in a row), and you select the first and third hit. The selected hits are positions 1 and 3. So, when you press the first a, that's 1 in a row. Then you skip the second a. The counter for consecutive presses does not reset. So when you press the third a, the consecutive count is 3 (since the original run is consecutive, and even though you skipped the second, the third a is still part of the same consecutive run in the original sequence). Therefore, the selected third a would contribute to the consecutive count, and if k is 2, this would be invalid.

But how to model this. The problem is that any sequence of the same character in the original sequence (like a group of consecutive a's) must be considered as a single run. So even if you select some hits from the group, the consecutive count for each selected hit is their position within the original group. So, for example, in a group of 5 a's:

Original positions: 1,2,3,4,5 (all 'a's)

If you select hits 1,3,5, then each of these is part of the original group. For each selected hit, their consecutive count in the original group is their position in the original group, not their position in the selected sequence. So when you process hit 3 in the original group (selected), the consecutive count would be 3 (since it's the third a in the original run). But the problem says that the button breaks if you press it more than k times in a row. So in this case, if k=2, selecting the third hit would cause the consecutive presses to be 3, which is over k. So it's not allowed.

Therefore, the problem requires that for each group of consecutive same characters in the original sequence, when selecting a subset of hits from that group, the selected hits must be such that in their original positions, any consecutive sequence of selected hits in the group can't have a length (in the original group's positions) that exceeds k. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the problem is that in the original group, any selected hit must not have a consecutive run in the original group longer than k. Because the consecutive count in the original group's positions is considered. For example, if in the original group, the selected hits are positions 1,2,3 (all consecutive in the original group), then that's 3 consecutive presses, which is allowed only if k >=3. But if the group is longer than k, you can't select more than k consecutive hits in the original group.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the original group (a run of same characters), the selected hits must form a subsequence where no more than k hits are selected in any consecutive sequence of the original group. For example, in the original group of 5 a's, if you select the first three, that's allowed if k >=3. But if k is 2, then selecting three in a row in the original group would be invalid.

But how to model this. Let me think again. The note says that if you skip a hit, the consecutive count doesn't reset. So the consecutive count is based on the original sequence's order. So for the selected hits, the consecutive count is determined by their positions in the original sequence. For example, if in the original group (a a a a a), the selected hits are 1,3,5. Then the consecutive count for hit 1 is 1. Then hit 3 is the third a in the original group (even though hit 2 is skipped). So pressing hit 3 would add to the consecutive count, making it 3. Which would be over k=2. So this selection is invalid.

Therefore, the problem requires that in the selected hits, for any run of same characters in the original sequence, the selected hits must form a subset where between any two selected hits in the same original group, there are no unselected hits that would create a consecutive sequence longer than k. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model each group of same characters (original consecutive runs) and within each such group, select a subset of hits such that in the original group's order, no more than k consecutive hits are selected. Wait, that's not possible because the original group could be longer than k. For example, in the second sample input, where the entire group is 5 a's and k=5. Then selecting all is allowed.

So the correct approach is: for each original group of same characters, the selected hits can be any subset, but any consecutive sequence of selected hits (in the original group's order) longer than k is not allowed. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the button breaks if you press it more than k times in a row. So the selected hits must form a sequence where no more than k consecutive presses of the same button occur. But the consecutive presses are considered based on the original sequence's order. So even if you skip some hits in between, the original positions determine the consecutive count.

Wait, maybe this is the key insight. The consecutive count for the button is determined by the original sequence's order. For example, if in the original group, you select the first, third, and fifth hit (all 'a's), then each of these hits are part of the original consecutive run. So when you select them, the consecutive count for the third hit is 3 (since in the original group, it's the third 'a'). So if k is 2, this is invalid. Therefore, the problem is that the selected hits in a group can't have any hit that is in a position (within the original group) that exceeds the allowed k. So for example, in the original group of 5 a's, if k=3, you can select up to 3 hits, but they must be the first three (since any hit after that would have a consecutive count in the original group that's higher than k). Wait, but even if you skip some hits. For example, if you select hit 1,3,5 in a group of 5 a's and k=3: hit 3's original position in the group is 3, which is allowed. But hit 5's position is 5. So pressing hit 5 would have a consecutive count of 5, which is over k=3. So that's invalid.

Therefore, the problem is that, for each group of same characters in the original sequence (a consecutive run), the selected hits can't include any hit whose position in the group is after the k-th position. Wait, no. Because perhaps you can select non-consecutive hits as long as in the original group's positions, the selected hits are spaced such that no more than k are selected in any consecutive k+1 positions. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the original group of same characters, each selected hit's position within the group (1-based) can't be part of a consecutive sequence (in the group's original order) longer than k. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: For each group of consecutive same characters in the original sequence, we can select some hits. However, in the selected subset, any consecutive sequence of hits in the original group's order must not have a length exceeding k.

Wait, but consecutive hits in the original group are those that are in positions i, i+1, ..., j. So, for example, if in the original group, the hits are [1,2,3,4,5], and k=3. Then selecting hits 1,2,3 is allowed. Selecting hits 2,3,4 is allowed (count 3). But selecting 1,3,5 would not form a consecutive sequence in the original group, so each is considered as individual presses. But according to the problem's note, skipping a hit (like 2 and 4 in this case) does not reset the counter. So the consecutive count for hit 3 in this selection would be 3 (since in the original group, hit 3 is the third consecutive a). So selecting hit 3 would be allowed only if k >=3. Similarly, selecting hit 5 would have a consecutive count of 5, which is over k=3.

So the key is that, for each hit in the group, the consecutive count is determined by their original position in the group. So each hit in the group has a position in the group (like 1st, 2nd, etc.), and the allowed hits are those that, when selected, their consecutive count (as per their original group positions) does not exceed k.

But that's not possible. For example, in the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:
7 3
1 5 16 18 7 2 10
baaaaca

The string is 'b a a a a c a'. The group for 'a' is positions 2-5 (assuming 1-based?), let's check the input. The third line is the string s. Let's see:

s is "baaaaca". So indices 0 to 6 (assuming 0-based in Python). So group 'a's are from index 1 to 4 (since the first 'b', then 4 'a's, then 'c', then 'a' again). So the first group of 'a's is of length 4. Then the 'c' is one hit, then another 'a' in position 6.

So for the first group (4 a's), k is 3. So for each hit in this group, the original positions in the group are 1,2,3,4. So when selecting hits from this group, the consecutive count for each selected hit is their position in the original group. So selecting the first three hits (positions 1,2,3 in the group) is allowed. The fourth hit (position 4 in the group) would have a consecutive count of 4, which is over k=3, so it can't be selected. Therefore, the maximum allowed in this group is the first three hits, but perhaps the fourth can be selected if there's a way to skip some hits before.

Wait, but according to the note, even if you skip a hit in between, the consecutive count doesn't reset. So in the group of 4 a's (original positions 1-4 in the group), if you select the first, third, and fourth hits. Then the consecutive count for the third hit is 3 (since in the group's original sequence, it's the third hit). The fourth hit's consecutive count would be 4 (since it's the fourth in the group). So even though you skipped the second hit, the consecutive count for the fourth hit is 4. So that's invalid. So you can't select the fourth hit in this group, regardless of which hits you select before, because the consecutive count would be 4, which exceeds k=3.

Therefore, for each group of same characters, the maximum number of hits you can select is the maximum possible sum of the top m hits in the group, where m is the group's length. However, in the group, you can select any subset of hits as long as their original positions in the group are <=k. Because once you select a hit in the group that has a position (in the group) >k, that would contribute to a consecutive count exceeding k.

Wait, no. Because even if you select a hit in position 3 (k=3), that's allowed. But selecting a hit in position 4 (k=3) is not allowed, since the consecutive count is 4.

Therefore, the solution for each group is to select the top min(k, len(group)) hits with the highest damage. But wait, because even if the group has len(group) >k, you can select any k hits from the group, but not necessarily consecutive. Wait, but according to the note, the consecutive count is based on the original group's order. So if you select hits in positions 1,3,4 in a group of len=5 and k=3, then the consecutive count for 3 is 3, and for 4 is 4. So that's invalid.

Wait, but this seems contradictory. How can the consecutive count for hit 4 in the group be 4, even though hit 2 was skipped? Because according to the note, skipping a hit (hit 2 in this case) does not reset the counter. So the consecutive count for hit 3 would be 3 (since it's the third hit in the original group), and hit 4 is the fourth. Therefore, even if you skip hit 2, the consecutive count is determined by the original group's positions.

Therefore, any hit in the group that has a position (in the group) >k can't be selected. Because selecting it would add to a consecutive count that exceeds k. So for example, in a group of length 5 and k=3, any hit in the group with position 1, 2, 3 can be selected. Hits 4 and 5 (positions in group 4,5) can't be selected, because their consecutive count would be 4 or 5, which exceeds k.

Wait, no. Because the consecutive count is determined by the original positions. For example, if you select hit 1, 2, 4 in the group. Then hit 4's position in the group is 4, which would cause a consecutive count of 4, which is over k=3. So even though hit 3 is skipped, the consecutive count for hit 4 is 4.

Therefore, the only way to select hits from a group is to select a subset where all selected hits are among the first k hits in the group. Because once you select a hit that's position in the group is >k, it would contribute to a consecutive count that's over k. Therefore, for each group of same characters, the maximum possible hits you can select is the top m hits, where m is min(k, len(group)).

But that can't be right. Let's look at the first sample input:

In the first sample input, the group of a's (the first group of a's) has len=4. So the first four a's. k is 3. So according to this approach, we can select the top 3 a's in this group. The a's in the group have damages 5, 16, 18,7. The group is a's at positions 1,2,3,4 (original indexes 1-based?), and the damages are 5,16,18,7. So the top three are 18,16,7 (sum 18+16+7=41) or wait, sorted in descending order: 18,16,7,5. So the top three are 18,16,7. Sum is 18+16+7=41. But in the sample input's explanation, the selected hits include 3 (damage 16) and 4 (damage 18) and 5 (damage 7). Wait, the group is 'baaaaca' (s = b a a a a c a). So the first a's are positions 1-4 (0-based?), but the original group is 4 a's. Then the fifth hit is 'a' again. Wait, the fifth character is 'a'? No, the string is "baaaaca". Let me count:

Indices 0: 'b'

1: 'a'

2: 'a'

3: 'a'

4: 'a'

5: 'c'

6: 'a'

So the first group of a's is from index 1 to 4 (inclusive), length 4. Then there's a 'c' at index 5, and another 'a' at index 6. So the group at index 6 is a separate group of length 1.

So the first group of a's has four elements, which are hits 1,2,3,4 (assuming 1-based hits). The damages for these hits are 5,16,18,7. So the group's a's have damages 5,16,18,7. So sorted descending order: 18,16,7,5. The top three are 18,16,7. So sum is 41. Then the fifth hit is part of another group (c) and the sixth hit is a group of a. So the sample input's explanation includes hits 3,4,5,6,7. Wait, in the sample explanation, the selected hits are [1,3,4,5,6,7]. Let's see:

Original hits (0-based?):

Hit 0: 'b' (damage 1)

Hit 1: 'a' (damage 5) → part of group 1 (indices 1-4)

Hit 2: 'a' (damage 16)

Hit 3: 'a' (damage 18)

Hit 4: 'a' (damage 7)

Hit 5: 'c' (damage 2)

Hit 6: 'a' (damage 10)

So group 1 is hits 1-4 (damages 5,16,18,7). The first group's a's. Then group 5 is 'c', group 6 is 'a'.

In the sample's solution, the selected hits are [0, 2,3,4,5,6]. Wait, the hit numbers given in the explanation are [1,3,4,5,6,7], which are 1-based. So hit 1 (damage 5) is selected. Hit 3 (damage 18) is selected. Hit 4 (damage 7) is selected. Hit 5 (damage 2) is part of 'c' group. Hit 6 (damage 10) is part of the 'a' group. So how does this fit into the logic.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because in the first group of a's (hits 1-4 in 1-based, which is 0-based indexes 0-3?), the selected hits are 1 (damage 5), 3 (damage 18), 4 (damage 7). So those are three hits. The sum is 5+18+7=30. Then the 'c' hit is selected (damage 2), and the last a (damage 10). But the problem says the total sum is 54. Let's add all:

Hit 1 (damage 5) → selected.

Hit 3 (damage 18).

Hit4 (damage7).

Hit5 (damage2) → 'c' → group of 1, allowed.

Hit6 (damage10) → 'a' → group of 1, allowed.

So sum is 5+18+7+2+10 = 42. But in the sample output it's 54. Oh wait, I must have miscalculated the hit indices.

Wait the sample input's first line is 7 3. So n=7 hits.

Second line: 1 5 16 18 7 2 10.

Third line: 'baaaaca' → indexes 0-6.

So the hits are:

Hit 0: 'b', a_0=1.

Hit 1: 'a', a_1=5.

Hit2: 'a', a_2=16.

Hit3: 'a', a_3=18.

Hit4: 'a', a_4=7.

Hit5: 'c', a_5=2.

Hit6: 'a', a_6=10.

The sample explanation says the selected hits are [1,3,4,5,6,7]. Wait, but in 1-based numbering, that's hits 1 (damage5), 3 (18),4 (7),5 (2),6 (10), but in 1-based the seventh hit is index6 (damage10). So the selected hits are 1,3,4,5,6,7 (1-based). Which translates to 0-based: 0, 2, 3, 4,5,6. Wait, no. 1-based hit 1 is index0, hit3 is index2, hit4 is index3, hit5 is index4, hit6 is index5, hit7 is index6. So the sum is 1+16+18+7+2+10=54. Oh right. So the first hit (index0) is 'b' (damage1) selected. Then hit2 (index2) is a with damage16. Hit3 (index3) a with 18. Hit4 (index4) a with7. Hit5 (index5) c with2. Hit6 (index6) a with10.

So the groups:

The first group is 'b' (length1). Then the next group is 'aaaa' (hits1-4 in the string, which are hits 1,2,3,4 in the input). Then 'c' (hit5), then 'a' (hit6).

So for the group 'aaaa' (hits 1-4 in input), which are a's. The group length is4. k is3. According to the initial approach, we need to select the top3 a's in this group. The damages in this group are 5,16,18,7. So the top3 are 18,16,7 (sum41). But in the sample solution, the selected hits in this group are hits1 (damage5?), hit2 (16), hit3 (18), hit4 (7). That's four hits. But wait, why are they allowed?

Ah! Because according to the problem statement, the consecutive count is determined by the original sequence. So in the group of four a's, the selected hits are 1 (index1), 2 (index2),3 (index3),4 (index4). So in the original group's positions, the selected hits are positions1,2,3,4. So their consecutive count would be 4. Which is over k=3. But according to the sample input's explanation, this is allowed. But why?

Wait this contradicts the initial analysis. So perhaps the initial analysis is wrong. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: the button breaks if you press it more than k times in a row. So consecutive presses in the selected sequence. So in the selected sequence, if there are more than k consecutive presses of the same button, then it's invalid.

Wait wait, no. The problem says: if you press some button more than k times in a row then it'll break. So consecutive presses in the sequence of selected hits. So the order of the selected hits must be preserved, but if in the selected hits, there's a consecutive run of the same button longer than k, then it's invalid.

Wait, this is a different understanding. The note says that if you skip a hit, the counter of consecutive presses won't reset. So the counter is based on the original sequence, not the selected sequence. But perhaps the note is referring to the button's consecutive presses, not the selected sequence's.

Wait, the problem's note says:

"Note that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset."

For example: if you have a sequence of a a a a. Suppose k=2. If you select the first two a's, then the counter is 2. Then you skip the third a. The note says that skipping the third a's hit does not reset the counter. So when you select the fourth a, the counter is considered as 3 (since in the original sequence, the fourth a is the fourth consecutive a). So even though the third a was skipped, the fourth a's consecutive count is 4, which is over k=2, so it's invalid. Therefore, in this scenario, you can't select the fourth a.

So the conclusion is that the consecutive count is determined by the original sequence's order. So for any selected hit, the consecutive count is the number of consecutive presses of that button in the original sequence up to and including that hit, including any skipped hits.

Therefore, for a group of same characters (like a run of a's), each hit in the group has a position in the original sequence. The consecutive count for a hit is its position in the original group. So for a group of length m, each hit in the group has a consecutive count of 1, 2, ..., m. So if you select a hit in the group whose consecutive count exceeds k, the button breaks. Therefore, the solution is that in each group of same characters, you can select any subset of hits, but none of them can have a consecutive count (in the original group) greater than k. So each selected hit in the group must have its position in the group (original consecutive count) <=k.

Therefore, for each group of same characters, we can select any subset of hits in the group where their positions in the group are <=k. Because those hits have a consecutive count (in the original group) <=k. So the problem reduces to, for each group, select the top m hits (where m is the group's length), but ensuring that for each selected hit, its position in the group is <=k.

Wait, but that's not the case. For example, in the third sample input:

Sample Input 3:
5 4
2 4 1 3 1000
aaaaa

Output: 1009.

In this case, the group is 5 a's. k=4. So the maximum allowed is 4 hits. But the sample output is 1009, which is the sum of 2+4+3+1000. So the selected hits are 0,1,3,4 (original indices?), but the group's positions are 0-4. The sum is 2+4+3+1000=1009. So the hit with a=1 (third in the group) was skipped. So the selected hits are positions0,1,3,4 in the group. Their consecutive counts are 1,2,4,5. Wait, but 5 is over k=4. So why is this allowed?

Ah, this contradicts the previous conclusion. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, the third sample input is:

n=5, k=4.

a is [2,4,1,3,1000]

s is 'aaaaa'.

So all 5 hits are in the same group. The maximum allowed is 4 hits. But the sample output is 1009, which is 2+4+3+1000=1009. The selected hits are indices0,1,3,4 (original group positions 1,2,4,5). The consecutive counts for these hits are 1,2,4,5. So the fifth hit (group position5) is included. But k=4. So this would imply that the fifth hit's consecutive count is 5, which is over k=4. So why is this allowed?

Ah, this suggests that our initial understanding is incorrect. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the previous reasoning.

So what's the correct way to model the problem?

Let's re-examine the problem statement carefully:

The problem states that if you press some button more than k times in a row, then the button breaks. The note clarifies that if you skip a hit, the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset. So the consecutive presses are based on the original sequence.

But what's the definition of "pressing the same button in a row"?

In the original sequence, the gamepad button presses are in order. When you select a subset of hits (in the same order as the original), the buttons pressed form a sequence. For each button in this sequence, if you have a consecutive run of more than k presses, the button breaks.

Wait, that's probably the correct interpretation. So the problem is that in the selected hits' sequence, there must be no run of the same button longer than k consecutive presses. So even if in the original sequence, the selected hits are from different groups, but in the selected sequence, there are consecutive same buttons that form a run longer than k.

But in the sample input 3, the group is all a's. So the selected hits are [0,1,3,4] (assuming 0-based). The selected sequence is a, a, a, a. But since k=4, this is allowed. So the run length is 4, which is exactly k. But the output is 1009, which is 2+4+3+1000 = 1009. Wait, the third hit (index2 in the original input) was skipped. So the selected hits are 0,1,3,4. So the selected sequence is a, a, a, a. So four consecutive a's, which is allowed. So why is the fifth hit (index4) included, making it a run of four a's. Wait, no, the fifth hit is index4? Wait, n=5, indices 0-4. So in the third sample input, the group is all 5 a's, and the selected hits are the first, second, fourth, and fifth hits. So their positions in the group are 1,2,4,5. But in the selected sequence, the buttons pressed are a, a, a, a (four a's). So the run length is 4, which is allowed. But the fifth hit's original position in the group is 5, which is over k=4. But according to the problem's note, the consecutive count is based on the original sequence's consecutive presses, not the selected sequence's.

This is confusing. Let me re-express the problem statement.

The problem says that you must not press the same button more than k times in a row. The note says that if you skip a hit, the consecutive counter doesn't reset. So the consecutive counter is the number of consecutive times the button was pressed in the original sequence, not the selected sequence. For example, if in the original sequence you have a a a a a, and you select hits 1,3,5 (original positions 1,3,5), then each of these hits is part of a longer original consecutive sequence. But the selected sequence's button presses are a, a, a. But according to the note, the consecutive counter for the third a (original position5) would be 5, because in the original sequence, it's the fifth consecutive a. So pressing it would result in a consecutive count of 5, which exceeds k=4, so it's invalid.

But in the third sample input, the selected hits are indices0,1,3,4. The group is all a's. So their positions in the original group are 1,2,4,5. The consecutive count for each hit is based on their original position. So the fourth selected hit (original group position5) has a consecutive count of5, which is over k=4. But according to the sample output, this is allowed. So this suggests that our initial understanding is wrong.

This is a contradiction. Therefore, the previous approach is incorrect.

So what's the correct way to model the problem?

Alternative approach:

The consecutive count for a button is based on the selected hits. When you select a hit, the consecutive count is the number of selected hits in a row (in the original sequence) that are the same button, up to and including that hit.

For example, if the original sequence is a a a a a, and k=3. If you select hits1,3,5 (original positions1,3,5), then in the selected sequence, each hit is an a. The consecutive count for hit1 is 1, for hit3 it's 2 (since hit2 was skipped, but hit3 is the second selected a in a row), and hit5 is the third. So total consecutive count is 3, which is allowed. But according to the problem's note, skipping hits does not reset the counter. So how does the note affect this scenario?

The note says that if you skip a hit, the counter of consecutive presses doesn't reset. So for example, in the original sequence a a a a a, if you select hit1 and hit3, then between them is hit2 which is skipped. The counter for hit3 would be 3 (original consecutive presses), but since hit2 was skipped, the counter for the selected hit3 would be 2 (the number of consecutive selected hits). Or is the counter based on the original sequence's consecutive presses?

This is the crux of the problem. The problem's note is ambiguous.

Let's re-read the note:

"Note that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset."

So, for example, suppose the original sequence is a a a a. If you select the first a and the third a. Then the counter for the third a is 3 (because in the original sequence, it's the third consecutive a), but you skipped the second a. Therefore, the consecutive count for the third a is 3, which would be over k=2.

Therefore, the button breaks even though you selected two a's (hit1 and hit3) but the consecutive count in the original sequence is 3 for hit3.

So in this case, selecting hit3 is not allowed, even though the selected sequence has two a's (hit1 and hit3), because the original sequence's consecutive count for hit3 is 3.

This is the correct interpretation according to the note.

So the problem is that the consecutive count for a selected hit is based on the original sequence's consecutive presses. So for a selected hit i, the consecutive count is the number of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence up to and including i, regardless of whether the previous hits were selected or not.

Therefore, to avoid breaking the button, for each selected hit i, the number of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence up to i must be <=k.

But this also can't be right. For example, in the first sample input:

The first group of a's is four in a row. The selected hits are 1,3,4 (original indices1,2,3 in the group). The consecutive count for hit1 is 1 (allowed), hit3 (original group position3) is 3 (allowed if k=3). Hit4 (original group position4) is 4 (over k=3). But according to the sample explanation, this hit is selected. But this would imply that the consecutive count is over k. But the sample's output is accepted. So this suggests that our understanding is incorrect.

This is very confusing. Let's look at the first sample input's explanation:

The selected hits are [1,3,4,5,6,7]. The hits 3,4,5 are in the first group of a's (which is four a's). So hit3 (original group position3), hit4 (group position4). But k=3, so hit4's consecutive count is 4. So why is this allowed?

This suggests that the consecutive count is based on the selected sequence's order, not the original sequence's. So for example, in the selected sequence, if you have a group of a's that are not consecutive in the original sequence, but are consecutive in the selected sequence, then they count towards the consecutive presses.

Wait, but the note says that skipping a hit in the original sequence doesn't reset the counter. So, for example, if you select a hit, then skip some hits, then select another hit of the same button, the counter continues from where it left off in the original sequence.

This is getting really complicated. Let's try to find an alternative approach.

Alternative approach:

The problem is to select a subset of hits in order, such that for each button, in the original sequence, any consecutive run of selected hits of that button must not have more than k in a row. However, the note says that skipping a hit doesn't reset the counter. So the consecutive count is based on the original sequence's order.

So, for example, if the original sequence is a a a a, and k=2. Then if you select the first and third a's, the consecutive count for the third a is 3 (since it's the third consecutive a in the original sequence), which is over k=2. So this is invalid. Therefore, the selected hits must not include any hit whose original consecutive count (number of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence up to and including this hit) exceeds k.

Therefore, for each hit, the number of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence up to this hit must be <=k.

Thus, the solution is to select all hits where the number of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence up to that hit is <=k. For example, in a group of m same buttons, the first k hits can be selected, the others cannot.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

For each group of consecutive same buttons, select the top min(k, len(group)) hits with the highest damage.

Because in each group, the first k hits are allowed (their consecutive count is <=k), and the rest are not allowed. Because any hit beyond the first k in a group has a consecutive count in the original sequence greater than k.

So this explains the sample input 3:

Group is 5 a's. k=4. So select the first 4 hits in the group (consecutive count 1,2,3,4). But the sample output is 1009, which includes the fifth hit (damage1000) which is the fifth in the group. So this approach must be wrong.

So there's a contradiction here. So what's the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the consecutive count is based on the selected sequence's order. For example, if you select hits from a group, the consecutive count for a selected hit is the number of selected hits in a row before and including this hit in the original sequence. So if you select hits that are not consecutive in the original sequence, their consecutive count would be based on how many are selected in a row.

For example, original sequence a a a a a. Select hits 1,3,5. The consecutive count for hit1 is 1, hit3 is 1 (because hit2 was skipped), hit5 is 1 (because hit4 was skipped). So the consecutive count is reset when a hit is skipped. But according to the note, this is not the case. The note says that skipping a hit doesn't reset the counter.

This is very confusing. Let's try to find the correct model by looking at the sample inputs.

Sample input 3:

n=5, k=4.

s=aaaaa.

We have 5 a's. The damage array is [2,4,1,3,1000].

The sample output is 1009. The selected hits are the first, second, fourth, and fifth hits (damage 2,4,3,1000). Sum is 2+4+3+1000=1009. So how does this fit with the problem's constraints.

The selected hits are indexes0,1,3,4 (0-based). So the consecutive count for each selected hit in the original group is 1,2,4,5. So according to the previous model (where the consecutive count is based on the original group's position), this would require k>=5. But the sample's k is4. So this must be allowed under a different model.

Therefore, the consecutive count is not based on the original group's position. It's based on the selected hits' sequence.

For example, in the selected sequence, if the buttons pressed are a, a, a, a, then the consecutive count is4, which is allowed for k=4.

So the problem's note is referring to the consecutive count in the original sequence, but the actual consecutive presses in the selected sequence.

But the note says that skipping a hit doesn't reset the counter. So if you select a hit, then skip some hits, then select another hit of the same button, the counter is not reset. So the consecutive count for the second hit is the number of consecutive same buttons in the original sequence up to that hit.

For example, original sequence is a a a a a.

Selected hits are 0,3. The first hit has consecutive count1, the second has consecutive count4. So if k=3, this is invalid.

But according to this model, the problem's note implies that the consecutive count is based on the original sequence. Therefore, the sample input3 is allowed because the selected hits' consecutive counts are1,2,4,5. But this would require k >=5. Which is not the case.

So this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. Therefore, there must be a different way to model the problem.

Alternative idea:

The consecutive count is based on the selected sequence. So for the selected sequence of hits, whenever there are consecutive same buttons, the count increases. Skipping a hit in the original sequence may not reset this count, but only if the skipped hit is of the same button and in the same original group.

For example, if the original sequence is a a a a a, and you select the first, third, and fifth hits, the selected sequence is a a a. These are three consecutive a's in the selected sequence, so the count is3, which is allowed if k>=3.

But according to the note, the consecutive count doesn't reset if you skip a hit. So in the original sequence, the third a is part of a group of five a's. So when you select the first and third a's, the counter would be 3 (original consecutive count) for the third a. So if k=2, this would be invalid.

But according to this model, the consecutive count is based on the original group's position, not the selected sequence.

But in the third sample input, the selected hits are indexes0,1,3,4. The original group is five a's. The consecutive counts for these hits are 1,2,4,5. Since k=4, the fifth consecutive count is5, which is over k=4. So this should not be allowed. But the sample output is accepted. Therefore, this model must be incorrect.

This suggests that the correct model is based on the selected sequence's consecutive presses. So the note is perhaps misleading.

In the third sample input, the selected hits are a, a, a, a (four a's). So the consecutive presses in the selected sequence are four, which is allowed for k=4. So the sample output is correct.

But the fifth hit (index4) in the original group has a consecutive count of5, but in the selected sequence, it's the fourth consecutive a. So the button's consecutive presses are based on the selected sequence's order, not the original sequence's.

Thus, the problem's note is misleading, and the consecutive count is based on the selected sequence's consecutive presses, not the original sequence.

In this case, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of hits in order, such that for any consecutive run of the same button in the selected sequence, the length is <=k.

This makes the problem similar to the problem where you can select hits but cannot have more than k consecutive same buttons in the selected sequence.

So the note is perhaps a red herring, and the actual consecutive count is based on the selected sequence. The note is perhaps saying that if you skip a hit in the original sequence, the consecutive count in the selected sequence doesn't reset. For example, if you have selected hits a, then skip a hit, then select another a, the consecutive count would be 2.

Wait, no. If the selected sequence is a, then after skipping some hits, another a. Then the consecutive count for the second a is 2. But how?

Perhaps the note is indicating that the counter of consecutive presses for the same button is maintained across skips. For example, if you select a hit, then skip some hits, then select another hit of the same button, the counter continues from where it left off. So the consecutive count is the number of consecutive presses of the same button in the selected sequence.

But this is the usual way consecutive counts are done. So the note's statement might be redundant, but the example in the first sample input shows that the selection includes hits from the same group but not consecutive in the original sequence.

So let's re-examine the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

7 3

1 5 16 18 7 2 10

baaaaca

The string is 'baaaaca' → groups are 'b', 'aaaa', 'c', 'a'.

The selected hits are [1,3,4,5,6,7] → which in 1-based are hits 1 (b, damage1), 3 (a, damage16), 4 (a, damage18),5 (a, damage7),6 (c, damage2),7 (a, damage10).

In the selected sequence, the a's are hits3,4,5 (damages16,18,7). Then there's a c (hit6), then another a (hit7). So the consecutive a's in the selected sequence are 3 (hits3,4,5), which is allowed for k=3. Then after the c, another a (hit7) starts a new consecutive run of 1.

So the consecutive counts in the selected sequence are 3 a's, 1 c, 1 a. All are within the k=3.

Thus, the solution is to select hits such that in the selected sequence, no run of the same button exceeds k consecutive presses. The note's clarification is that the counter for consecutive presses does not reset when you skip a hit. But in this model, the counter is based on the selected sequence's consecutive presses, not the original's. So the note is perhaps not relevant, and the problem is simply about selecting hits with no run of same buttons longer than k.

But this contradicts the third sample input's explanation. Let's see:

Sample Input 3:

5 4

2 4 1 3 1000

aaaaa

The selected hits are 0,1,3,4. The selected sequence is a, a, a, a (damages 2,4,3,1000). The consecutive run is four a's, which is allowed for k=4. So the sum is 2+4+3+1000=1009.

But the fifth hit in the original group is included. But according to this model, the consecutive run in the selected sequence is four a's, which is allowed. So the sample is correct.

Thus, the problem is simply to select a subset of hits in order, ensuring that no run of the same button in the selected sequence exceeds k consecutive presses.

The note's statement is confusing. But based on the sample inputs, this is the correct model.

So the problem becomes: select a subset of hits in order, such that in the selected sequence, any consecutive run of the same button has length <=k. And the goal is to maximize the sum of a_i for the selected hits.

This model makes the problem manageable.

So the approach is to model each group of consecutive same characters in the original sequence. For each group, we can select up to k hits. But the selected hits must not form a run longer than k in the selected sequence.

Wait, but this is not correct. Because the groups are in the original sequence. So if there are multiple groups of the same button in the original sequence, selecting hits from each group can create longer runs in the selected sequence.

For example, suppose the original sequence has two groups of a's separated by other buttons. If you select hits from both groups, then the selected sequence will have a run of a's from the first group, followed by other buttons, then a run of a's from the second group. These are separate runs and allowed.

But if two groups of a's are consecutive (but in the original sequence, there's a different button between them), then selecting hits from both groups will create separate runs.

But in the original sequence, if a group is followed by another group of the same button (without any other buttons in between), then they are part of a single group.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

For each group of consecutive same button presses in the original sequence, we can select up to k hits from the group. Because selecting more than k hits from a group would create a run longer than k in the selected sequence.

Therefore, the solution is to process each group of consecutive same button presses, and for each group, select up to k hits with the highest a_i values. Sum those selected hits' a_i values.

This model matches the sample inputs.

Let's verify with the first sample input:

The first group is 'b', which is one hit. We select it (sum 1).

The second group is 'aaaa' (four a's). We select the top 3 a's with the highest a_i values. The a_i's are5,16,18,7. The top three are18,16,7 (sum41).

The third group is 'c', select one hit (sum2).

The fourth group is 'a', select one hit (sum10).

Total sum: 1+41+2+10=54. Which matches the sample output.

Sample input 3:

Group is 'aaaaa' (5 a's). Select top4 a's. The a_i's are2,4,1,3,1000. The top four are1000,4,3,2. Sum 1000+4+3+2=1009. But the sample's selected hits are 2,4,3,1000. Sum is 4+3+1000=1007? No. Wait, the a_i's are [2,4,1,3,1000]. The top four are 1000,4,3,2. Sum is 1009. But in the sample input's explanation, the sum is 2+4+3+1000=1009, which matches.

So this approach works.

So the solution is:

For each group of consecutive same characters in the original sequence, select up to k hits with the highest a_i values. Sum those.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Split the input into groups of consecutive same characters.

2. For each group, collect the a_i values.

3. Sort the a_i values in descending order.

4. Take the first min(k, len(group)) elements.

5. Sum all those elements.

This is the correct approach.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

First, split the sequence into groups. For example, for the string s, we can iterate and create groups.

For each group, we have a list of a_i's.

Sort the list in descending order, take the first min(k, len(group)) elements, sum them.

Sum all these sums.

This will be the maximum damage.

This matches all the sample inputs.

Sample input 3:

Group is 5 a's. Take top4 a's. The a_i's are 2,4,1,3,1000. Sorted: 1000,4,3,2,1. Take first4: sum 1000+4+3+2=1009. Which matches.

Sample input 5:

6 3

14 18 9 19 2 15

cccccc

Group is 6 c's. Take top3: sorted a_i's are19,18,15,14,9,2. sum19+18+15=52. Which matches sample output.

Sample input 6:

2 1

10 10

qq

Group is 2 q's. Take top1. So sum10.

Thus, the approach works.

The implementation steps are:

1. Iterate through the characters in s, grouping consecutive same characters and collecting their a_i's.

2. For each group, sort the a_i's in descending order, take first min(k, len(group)) elements, sum them.

3. Sum all these sums.

Now, the code.

Read n, k.

Read a as a list.

Read s.

Process the groups:

Initialize groups. For example, groups is a list of lists.

current_char = s[0]

current_group = [a[0]]

Then, for each character in s[1:]:

if same as current_char:

append a[i] to current_group.

else:

add current_group to groups.

current_char = current character.

current_group = [a[i]]

After loop, add the last current_group.

Then, for each group in groups:

sort the group in descending order.

take the sum of the first min(k, len(group)) elements.

sum all these sums.

This will be the answer.

Now, the code in Python:

Read n and k.

a = list of integers.

s = input string.

groups = []

current_char = s[0]

current_group = [a[0]]

for i in range(1, n):

    if s[i] == current_char:

        current_group.append(a[i])

    else:

        groups.append(current_group)

        current_char = s[i]

        current_group = [a[i]]

groups.append(current_group)

sum_total = 0

for group in groups:

    group_sorted = sorted(group, reverse=True)

    take = min(k, len(group_sorted))

    sum_total += sum(group_sorted[:take])

print(sum_total)

This code should handle all cases.

Testing sample input3:

groups is [[2,4,1,3,1000]]

sorted: [1000,4,3,2,1]. take first4: sum 1000+4+3+2=1009.

Sample input6:

groups is [[10, 10]]. take first1: sum10.

Sample input4:

Input4:

8 1

10 15 2 1 4 8 15 16

qqwweerr

The string is 'qqwweerr'. So groups are 'qq', 'ww', 'ee', 'rr'.

For each group:

'qq' → len 2, take1. a's are 10,15. sorted [15,10]. sum15.

'ww' → a's are2,1. take1: sum2.

'ee' → a's are4,8. take1: sum8.

'rr' → a's are15,16. take1: sum16.

Total sum:15+2+8+16=41. Which matches the sample output.

Thus, the code works.

Now, the code needs to be efficient. The constraints are n up to 2e5. Grouping is O(n). Sorting each group is O(m log m), where m is the size of the group. Since the sum of m's is n, the total time is O(n log m), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

For example, if all groups are size 1, then O(n) time. If a group is size 2e5, then O(2e5 log 2e5) which is about 2e5 * 20 ≈ 4e6 operations.

Thus, the code is efficient.

Thus, this is the correct solution.
