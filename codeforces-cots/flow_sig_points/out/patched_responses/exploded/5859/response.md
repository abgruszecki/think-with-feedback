Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Amr wants to move the center of a circle from one position to another using the least number of steps. Each step involves rotating the circle around a pin placed on its border, which can move the center. Let me think about how to model this.

The problem says that in each step, you can rotate the circle around a pin (a point on the circle's border) by any angle. When you rotate, the pin stays fixed, and the center moves in a circular path around that pin. The radius of that path is equal to the original radius of the circle. So each rotation moves the center by a distance equal to twice the radius? Wait, no. Let's see: if the center is at (x, y), and the pin is at (x + r, y), then rotating 180 degrees around the pin would move the center to (x + 2r, y). So each rotation can move the center by up to 2r units in a straight line. But if the rotation is a different angle, maybe the movement is in some other direction, but the maximum possible displacement per step is 2r. Hmm.

Wait, when you rotate around a pin, the center moves along a circle with radius equal to the original radius (since the pin is on the original circle). So the maximum distance the center can move in one step is 2r (when rotating 180 degrees, moving the center to the diametrically opposite point relative to the pin). So each step can move the center by up to 2r units in some direction.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps needed to cover the distance between the original and target positions, where each step can cover at most 2r units. But wait, maybe you can do better by making steps in different directions. Let me think.

Let's calculate the Euclidean distance between the original and target points. Let d be the distance between (x, y) and (x', y'). Then, each step can cover a distance of up to 2r. But how?

Wait, maybe each step can cover exactly 2r units. Because when you rotate 180 degrees, the movement is exactly 2r. If you do a smaller rotation, the displacement would be less. But since we can choose any angle, maybe the optimal strategy is to make each step cover as much as possible, i.e., 2r, except possibly the last step.

Wait, but in each step, you can choose the direction. So, for example, the first step moves the center 2r in some direction towards the target. Then the next step moves another 2r, etc. But if the remaining distance is more than 2r, then you need another step. Wait, but perhaps this isn't the case. Let's think in terms of geometry.

The minimal number of steps would be the ceiling of d/(2r). But wait, looking at the first sample input:

Sample 1:
r=2, original (0,0), target (0,4). The distance d is 4 units. 4/(2*2) = 1. So the answer is 1, which matches the sample.

Sample 2:
r=1, original (1,1), target (4,4). The distance is sqrt((3)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(18) ≈4.2426. Divided by 2*1=2. So 4.2426 / 2 ≈2.12, so ceiling is 3. Which matches the sample.

Sample 3:
Same position, so 0 steps. That's correct.

So the general approach would be to compute the distance between the two points, divide by (2r), take the ceiling, but only if the points are different. Wait, but how about when the distance is exactly a multiple of 2r? Then the steps would be exactly (d/(2r)).

But wait, let's test another case. Suppose the distance is exactly 2r. Then one step suffices. If it's 3r, then 2 steps: first step 2r, second step r (but wait, can that be done in two steps? Wait, in each step, you can move up to 2r, but the next step can be in any direction. So perhaps the minimal steps is the ceiling of (d/(2r)). Let's see.

Wait, think of the distance as a straight line. The minimal steps is the smallest integer k such that k * (2r) ≥ d. Which is exactly the ceiling of d/(2r). But wait, when k is integer, that would be the ceiling. So yes.

So the solution is to compute the distance between the two centers, divide by (2r), take the ceiling. But wait, the problem allows for steps that are in any direction. So in each step, you can move the center by 2r units towards the target, but after each step, the direction might change. But the minimal steps would be when you move straight towards the target each step, maximizing the distance covered. So the minimal steps are indeed the ceiling of d/(2r).

But wait, in the first step, you can move 2r units. Then the remaining distance is d - 2r. If that's still larger than 2r, you need another step, etc. So the number of steps is the minimal k where 2r * (k-1) < d ≤ 2r * k. Which is k = ceil(d/(2r)).

So the approach is:

1. Compute the Euclidean distance d between (x,y) and (x',y').

2. If d is zero, return 0.

3. Else, compute k = ceil(d/(2r)).

But wait, how to compute that?

For example, if d is exactly 2r * m, then k is m. Else, if d is between 2r*(m-1) and 2r*m), then k is m.

So to compute this, in Python, we can calculate (d // (2r)) and then check if there's a remainder. If there's a remainder, add 1. Alternatively, using math.ceil(d / (2r)), but since d can be a floating point number, perhaps the best way is to compute the distance squared, then compare (d^2) with (2r * k)^2, but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, but how to compute d. Let me think. The distance between (x,y) and (x', y') is sqrt((dx)^2 + (dy)^2). So d is sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2). Then, the steps needed are ceil(d/(2r)).

So in code:

dx = x' - x

dy = y' - y

distance = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

if distance == 0:

    return 0

else:

    steps = math.ceil(distance / (2*r))

But wait, how precise is that calculation? Since we are dealing with floating points, perhaps there's a risk of precision errors. For example, if the actual distance is exactly 3r, but due to floating point precision, it's computed as slightly less than 3r, leading to steps being 1.5 which would ceil to 2. But maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, compute distance squared, then compare (2r*k)^2 and d^2.

Because 2r*k is the maximum possible distance after k steps (each step 2r). So, the minimal k such that (2r*k)^2 >= (dx^2 + dy^2).

But since k is an integer, we can compute k as the minimal integer where (2r*k) >= d. Which is equivalent to the earlier approach.

But using the squared approach could avoid sqrt, which is better for precision. For example:

d_squared = dx*dx + dy*dy

max_step_squared = (2*r)**2

But wait, the steps are cumulative. Wait, no. Each step can move 2r in the direction towards the target, so after k steps, the total movement is 2r*k. So the minimal k such that 2r*k >= sqrt(d_squared). So sqrt(d_squared) <= 2r*k.

Squaring both sides, d_squared <= (2r*k)^2.

But since 2r*k is a real number, the minimal k is the ceiling of (sqrt(d_squared) )/(2r).

But to compute this, we can use sqrt(d_squared) which is the same as d. So the steps are the same as before.

But perhaps using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. Let's think: since d_squared is (dx^2 + dy^2), which is an integer. And 2r is an integer (given r is integer). So 2r*k is an integer multiplied by k.

But perhaps using the squared approach could allow us to compute k without using sqrt. Let me see.

The minimal k is the smallest integer such that (2r*k) >= sqrt(d_squared).

Squaring both sides:

(2r*k)^2 >= d_squared

=> 4r²k² >= d_squared

=> k² >= d_squared/(4r²)

=> k >= sqrt( d_squared )/(2r )

Which is the same as before.

So, using the squared approach may not help. So perhaps the original approach is better.

But in code, calculating the square root may lead to precision issues. For example, if dx and dy are such that dx² + dy² is a perfect square, but due to floating point precision, sqrt returns a value slightly less than the exact value, leading to an incorrect ceil.

But for integers dx and dy, the square root can be calculated accurately if the sum of squares is a perfect square. However, in most cases, it's not. So perhaps the better way is to compute the distance as a float and then proceed.

Alternatively, compute k as the ceiling of (d / (2r)).

But how to compute this accurately?

In Python, math.sqrt can handle integer sums, but for very large values (since x and y can be up to 1e5 in either direction), the sum dx² + dy² can be up to (2e5)^2 + (2e5)^2) = 8e10, which is within the precision of a 64-bit float, since Python uses double-precision floats which have 53 bits of mantissa. So numbers up to 2^53 can be represented exactly. 8e10 is about 8e10, which is 8*10^10, which is 8,000,000,000. 2^36 is about 68 billion, which is larger than 8e10. So 8e10 is less than 2^36. So the sum dx^2 + dy^2 can be up to 8e10, which is less than 2^36. So when we compute sqrt of that, we get a float that can represent exactly the exact value only if the sum is a perfect square. Otherwise, it's an approximation. However, when we compute the division by 2r (which is an integer), we can have some precision loss.

But perhaps this isn't a problem for the problem's test cases. Let's see.

For example, in the second sample:

dx is 3, dy is 3. Sum is 18. sqrt(18) is 4.2426... . Divided by 2*1=2, gives 2.1213..., ceil is 3. Which is correct.

So in code, steps = math.ceil( (dx**2 + dy**2)**0.5 / (2*r) )

But perhaps to avoid floating points, we can compute k using integer arithmetic.

We can compute the minimal k such that (2r*k) >= sqrt(d_squared). So:

k is the minimal integer where (2r*k)^2 >= d_squared.

So, k = ceil( sqrt(d_squared) / (2r) )

But how to compute this without floating points?

We can compute k as the ceiling of (sqrt(d_squared) ) / (2r). But this is the same as before.

But perhaps to compute this, we can use binary search on k. Let's see.

We need to find the minimal k such that 2r*k >= sqrt(d_squared).

Which is equivalent to k >= sqrt(d_squared)/(2r).

But since d_squared is a positive integer (if the points are different), we can compute sqrt(d_squared) as the exact distance. But that's the same as d.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

So the code steps are:

Read r, x, y, x', y'.

Compute dx = x' - x

Compute dy = y' - y

d_squared = dx*dx + dy*dy

if d_squared == 0:

    print(0)

else:

    d = sqrt(d_squared)

    steps = math.ceil( d / (2*r) )

    print(steps)

But how to handle the calculation in Python? Let's see.

In Python, math.ceil returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.

But when dealing with very large numbers, but the input constraints are manageable. For example, even if dx and dy are 1e5 each, their squares sum to 2e10, sqrt is about 1.414e5, which when divided by 2*r (up to 2e5) could be 0.707, ceil to 1.

But perhaps the key is to compute the distance as a float and proceed.

But what about cases where the distance is exactly divisible by 2r?

For example, distance is 4, 2r is 4 (r=2), so steps is 1. Correct.

Another example: distance is 6, 2r is 2 (r=1). 6/2=3. Steps 3. Which would be correct.

So the code seems correct.

But let's test some edge cases.

Test case 1:

Input: 1 0 0 0 0 → Output 0.

Test case 2:

Input: 1 0 0 2 0 → distance is 2. 2/(2*1) =1 → steps 1. Correct.

Test case 3:

Input: 1 0 0 3 0. Distance is 3. 3/2=1.5 → ceil is 2. So steps 2.

But can you do it in two steps?

First step: move 2 units (from 0 to 2), then second step: move 1 unit (from 2 to 3). So yes. Two steps.

Yes.

So the code works for this case.

Another case: distance is 5, 2r is 2. 5/2=2.5 → ceil to 3 steps.

So the code would return 3. Which is correct.

So the code seems correct.

So the code steps are:

- Read the input.

- Compute dx and dy.

- Compute the distance squared.

- If it's zero, output 0.

- Else, compute the distance as sqrt(dx² + dy²), divide by (2*r), take the ceiling.

Implement this in Python.

Now, code in Python:

But wait, how to read the input? The input is 5 space-separated integers: r, x, y, x', y'.

So in code:

import math

r, x, y, x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())

dx = x1 - x

dy = y1 - y

distance_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy

if distance_sq == 0:

    print(0)

else:

    distance = math.sqrt(distance_sq)

    steps = math.ceil( distance / (2 * r) )

    print(steps)

But wait, math.ceil returns an integer, but when dividing by a float, the result could be a float. For example, 4.0 would be correctly ceiled to 4.0, but in Python, math.ceil returns an integer if possible?

Wait, no: math.ceil returns a float in Python 3 for integer inputs. Wait, no. Let me check.

For example, math.ceil(2.0) is 2.0 as a float, but when printed, it's 2.0. But when you convert to an integer, it's 2. So in the code, when steps is computed as a float (like 1.0), converting it to an integer would be okay.

Wait, but the code as written would print steps as a float. For example, if steps is 3.0, then print would output 3.0, but the problem expects an integer. So that's a problem.

Ah, right! So in Python, math.ceil returns a float. So, for example, math.ceil(4.0) is 4.0, and math.ceil(4.1) is 5.0. So when we print, we need to cast it to an integer.

So the code should be:

steps = math.ceil( distance / (2 * r) )

print( int(steps) )

Yes. Otherwise, the output would have .0 at the end, which is invalid.

So the code needs to cast steps to an integer.

So the corrected code is:

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
import math


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    r, x, y, x1, y1 = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    dx = x1 - x

    dy = y1 - y

    distance_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy

    if distance_sq == 0:

        print(0, file=output_stream)

    else:

        distance = math.sqrt(distance_sq)

        steps = math.ceil( distance / (2 * r) )

        print(int(steps), file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

            "output": \
"""\

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 1: 2 0 0 0 4. distance is 4. 4/(2*2)=1 → steps 1. Correct.

Sample3: same position → 0. Correct.

Another test case: 1 0 0 3 0. distance 3. 3/(2*1)=1.5 → ceil 2 → output 2. Correct.

So the code should be correct.

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum input is 1e5 for coordinates. So dx and dy can be up to 2e5 each. Squaring them gives 4e10 each, sum up to 8e10. math.sqrt can handle that accurately? Let me think. Python uses double-precision floats, which can represent integers up to 2^53 exactly. 8e10 is about 8*1e10 = 8,000,000,000. 2^33 is about 8.5e9, 2^34 is 1.7e10, 2^35 is 3.4e10, 2^36 is 6.8e10. So 8e10 is between 2^36 and 2^37. The sum dx^2 + dy^2 is 8e10 in the worst case, which is larger than 2^36. So when stored as a float, it can't be represented exactly. But when we take the square root, the error may be minimal. However, the division by 2r (which can be up to 2e5) would be added.

But how does this affect the calculation of steps?

Suppose the actual distance is d, and the computed distance is d_approx. If d_approx is slightly less than the actual d due to floating point precision, then d_approx/(2r) could be slightly less than the actual value, leading to a ceil that is one less than required.

For example, if the actual distance is 2r * k, but due to floating point error, the computed distance is (2r *k) - epsilon. Then the division by 2r would give k - epsilon/(2r), and the ceil would be k-1 if epsilon/(2r) is at least 1, but that's unlikely.

Wait, 2r can be up to 2e5. The epsilon for numbers around 2e5 is about 2e5 * 2^-52 (since the mantissa is 52 bits plus the implicit leading 1). For 2e5, the epsilon is about 2e5 * 1e-15 ≈ 2e-10, which is negligible. So even if the actual distance is 2r*k, the computed sqrt would be accurate enough for the division and ceil to give the correct k.

Therefore, using the code with math.sqrt should be safe.

Thus, the code is correct.
