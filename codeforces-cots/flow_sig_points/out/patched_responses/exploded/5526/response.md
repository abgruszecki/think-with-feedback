<think>
Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of ways to divide students into groups such that the total imbalance is at most k. Hmm. Let's think.

First, the imbalance of a group is max(a_i) - min(a_i) in that group. The total is the sum of imbalances of all groups. So the problem is to count all possible partitions of the students into groups where the sum of (max - min) per group doesn't exceed k.

But the students are ordered here? Wait, the division is based on the actual arrangement of the students. Like, the way groups are formed depends on their positions. Wait, the problem says that two divisions are distinct if any pair is in the same group in one but different in the other. So the groups are determined by which students are grouped together, but since the students are distinct (they have different a_i's?), no, wait, maybe the students are considered in the order given. Because in the first example, the groups are split into different ways, like first and second in a group, third alone, etc. So the order of the students as given in the input matters. So the groups must consist of contiguous students? Wait, no. Because the problem statement says that two divisions are different if any pair is in the same group in one but not the other. So grouping is determined by the partition of the students, not their order. So, for example, if students 1 and 3 are in the same group but student 2 is alone, that's a different division than students 1 and 2 being grouped and 3 alone. Wait, no. Because the way the problem is phrased, the groups are just a partition of the set of students. So any partition is allowed as long as the sum of imbalances per group is <=k.

Wait, but that's not possible because the sample input 1 has three students with a_i's 2,4,5. The possible groupings are:

1. {1}, {2}, {3}: total imbalance 0.
2. {1,2}, {3}: imbalance (4-2) +0 = 2.
3. {2,3}, {1}: imbalance (5-4) +0 =1.
But the sample output is 3, which also includes the case where all three are in their own groups. So how does the sample have three options? Wait, the first sample's output is 3, which includes all three possible groupings where the sum is <=2. Oh right, so another possible grouping is {1}, {2,3}, but that gives 1 (5-4=1) plus 0, sum is 1. So that's allowed. So the total is 3 options: {1,2}, {3}; {1}, {2,3}; and all three individuals. So the answer is 3.

But wait, how do those groupings count as distinct? Because in the first case, group {1,2} and {3}; in the second case, group {2,3} and {1}; and the third case all individual. So these are three different partitions.

So the problem is about finding all possible partitions into groups such that the sum of (max - min) for each group is <=k. So the key is that the students can be partitioned in any possible way, not just contiguous ones. Wait no. Wait, the first sample's possible partitions are the ones where groups are contiguous. Because in the first sample, how else could the grouping be? Like {1,3} as a group and {2} alone. Then the imbalance would be (5-2) =3. Sum is 3, which is more than k=2. So that's not allowed. So in the first sample, that grouping isn't considered. So the answer counts the groupings where the groups are contiguous. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the students are arranged in a particular order, and the groups must consist of consecutive students. Because otherwise, the problem would be much harder. For example, if the students can be grouped in any way (not necessarily contiguous), the number of possible partitions would be the Bell numbers, which is way too big for n=200. But with n up to 200, the constraints would require an O(n^3) solution at most. So maybe the problem requires the groups to be contiguous, i.e., the array is divided into contiguous subarrays. Because otherwise, the number of possible partitions would be way too large for n=200.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't mention anything about the groups being contiguous. So that's confusing. Let me read the problem statement again.

The problem says: "How many ways are there for the students to divide into groups so that the total imbalance of all groups is at most k?"

But in the first sample, the possible groupings that are valid are the ones where groups are contiguous. For example, {1,2} and {3}, {1} and {2,3}, and all three as individuals. Because any non-contiguous grouping (like {1,3} and {2}) would have an imbalance of 3 (5-2=3) which is over k=2, so it's not allowed. But if the students can be partitioned in any way (non-contiguous), then how do we model that?

But considering that in the sample input 1, the a_i are 2,4,5. So if the group {1,3} is allowed, the imbalance is 5-2=3, which exceeds the k=2. So that's not allowed. So in the sample, only the contiguous groupings are considered. But how is that the case? Because the problem doesn't state that groups must be contiguous.

Wait, perhaps the students are considered in the order given, and the groups must be intervals. Because otherwise, the problem becomes impossible for n=200. Let's think: the number of possible partitions (regardless of grouping) is the Bell number, which for n=200 is astronomically large. So with n=200, the solution must be based on dynamic programming where the grouping is made of contiguous segments.

So the key insight here is that the students are ordered, and the groups must be contiguous. Otherwise, the problem is not tractable for n=200. Because the DP state would be O(n^2 * k), which for n=200 and k=1000 is manageable. But if the groups can be non-contiguous, then the DP state would need to track subsets of students, which is impossible for n=200.

Therefore, the problem is that the students must be partitioned into contiguous groups. So the groups are consecutive sequences of students in the original order. So the problem reduces to partitioning the array into contiguous subarrays, such that the sum of (max - min) of each subarray is <=k. The number of such partitions is what we need to compute.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the first sample's answer only includes contiguous groupings, which suggests that the groups must be contiguous.

So now, the problem becomes: partition the array into contiguous groups, each group contributes (max in group - min in group) to the total. We need to count the number of such partitions where the sum is <=k.

Now, this changes everything. Now the problem is manageable with DP.

So the plan is to first sort the array? Wait, no. Wait, the groups are contiguous in the original order, not sorted. So the original order matters. For example, if the array is [5, 2, 4], then a group consisting of [5,2,4] would have max 5, min 2, imbalance 3. But if the array was sorted, the min and max would be different.

So the order of the students in the array is important. Therefore, the groups are contiguous in the original order.

So the solution is to model the problem as splitting the array into contiguous segments. For each possible split, compute the sum of (max - min) for each segment, and count the number of splits where the sum is <=k.

Now, for this, the DP approach would be:

Let dp[i][s] be the number of ways to split the first i students into groups such that the total imbalance is s.

But with n=200 and k=1000, s can be up to 200 * (500-1) = 200*499= 99,800, which is way larger than k=1e3. So if k is up to 1000, then for s >k, we can ignore those states.

So the DP state can be defined as dp[i][s] = number of ways to split the first i students into groups, with total imbalance exactly s. But since we need the sum <=k, the answer would be the sum over all s from 0 to k of dp[n][s].

But considering that for each i, the maximum possible s would be up to i * (max a_i - min a_i). However, since a_i can be up to 500, the maximum possible for a group of j elements is 500-1=499. So for each group, the imbalance can be up to 499. So the sum can be up to 200 * 499 = 99,800. But since k can be up to 1e3, it's possible that we need to track s up to 1e3. However, if the current sum s plus the imbalance of the next possible group exceeds k, then we can ignore that transition.

So the DP approach can be optimized as follows:

We can represent the DP as a dictionary for each i, where for each possible sum s (<=k), we track the number of ways. Then, for each position i, we consider all possible previous positions j, and compute the imbalance of the group [j+1..i]. Then, for each possible sum s_prev in dp[j], if s_prev + current_imbalance <=k, we add the count to dp[i][s_prev + current_imbalance].

The steps are:

1. Pre-sort the students? No, because the groups are contiguous in the original order, so the order must be preserved. So the original array is processed as is.

2. Precompute for all possible groups [l..r] the imbalance (max - min) for that group. Since n is up to 200, precomputing all possible intervals l..r is O(n^2), which is manageable.

3. Then use dynamic programming where dp[i][s] is the number of ways to split the first i students into groups with a total imbalance of s. For each i, iterate j from 0 to i-1, compute the imbalance of the group j+1 to i, and then update dp[i][s + imbalance] += dp[j][s], provided that s + imbalance <=k.

The base case is dp[0][0] = 1.

But for n=200, and k=1e3, the time complexity would be O(n^2 * k). Let's see: for each i (up to 200), and for each possible j <i (up to 200), and for each possible s_prev up to k (1e3), then adding to dp[i][s_prev + imbalance]. So the total operations would be 200*200*1e3 = 4e7. Which is manageable within 2 seconds (Python can handle about 1e8 operations in a second, but 4e7 is 40 million, which is acceptable).

So the steps are:

- Precompute the imbalance for all possible intervals [l..r].
- Use dynamic programming to track possible sums up to k.

Now, the key is to precompute the max and min for all intervals [l..r]. How to do this efficiently.

For each l from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based), we can track the max and min as we expand r from l to n-1. For each l, initialize current_max and current_min as a[l]. Then, for r from l to n-1, compute current_max = max(current_max, a[r]), current_min = min(current_min, a[r]), and store the imbalance as current_max - current_min. This is O(n^2) time.

Once that's done, for each possible group [j..i] (where in the code, j is the previous index), we can get the imbalance in O(1) time.

Then, the DP proceeds as follows:

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1.

For each i from 1 to n:

   For j from 0 to i-1:

      get the imbalance of the group [j+1 ... i] (assuming 1-based?)

Wait, in the code, the array is 0-based. Let's clarify:

Assuming the students are 0-based in the array. Then, for a group starting at j+1 and ending at i (inclusive), the indices are from j+1 to i. So for example, if j=0 and i=2, the group is [0,1,2].

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the students as 1-based. Let me think again. Let's say the students are 1-based. Then, for a group starting at l and ending at r (inclusive), the imbalance is max(a[l..r]) - min(a[l..r]).

So for the DP, when we are at position i (1-based), we can split into groups where the last group ends at i. The previous positions j (0 <= j < i) represent that the last group starts at j+1. So the group is j+1 to i.

So precompute the imbalance for all intervals [l, r] where 1 <= l <= r <=n.

So for each i, j can range from 0 to i-1. Then, for each j, the group is j+1 ... i. The imbalance for that group is precomputed.

Thus, during the DP steps:

For each i (current end), for each j (previous end), we look at the group j+1 to i, get its imbalance, and for each possible sum s_prev in dp[j], if s_prev + imbalance <=k, then add to dp[i][s_prev + imbalance] the value of dp[j][s_prev].

The initial state is dp[0][0] = 1.

The answer is the sum of dp[n][s] for s from 0 to k.

Now, the key is to implement the DP efficiently, using arrays or dictionaries to track the current sums.

But in Python, using a list of lists might be manageable. For each i, we can have a list of size k+1, representing the number of ways to split the first i students with sum s up to k.

But for n=200 and k=1e3, each dp[i] is a list of size 1e3+1. So the total memory is 200*1e3=2e5, which is acceptable.

So the steps for the code:

1. Read n, k.

2. Read the array a as a list of integers. Let's assume 1-based for the array.

3. Precompute for all intervals [l, r] (1<=l<=r<=n) the imbalance (max - min) of the subarray a[l..r].

   This can be done by for each l in 1..n, track the current max and min as we expand r from l to n.

   So:

   pre = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

   for l in range(1, n+1):

       current_max = a[l-1]

       current_min = a[l-1]

       pre[l][l] = 0

       for r in range(l+1, n+1):

           current_max = max(current_max, a[r-1])

           current_min = min(current_min, a[r-1])

           pre[l][r] = current_max - current_min

   Wait, but the array is 0-based in Python. So for a list a of length n, a[0] is the first student, a[1] is the second, etc. So if we are considering the interval [l, r] in 1-based (students 1 to n), then in Python the indices are l-1 to r-1. So for example, for l=1, r=1: a[0].

   So during precomputing, for each l (starting at 1), r starts at l and increases.

   For each l from 1 to n:

       current_max = a[l-1]

       current_min = a[l-1]

       pre[l][l] = 0  # since the group is a single student.

       for r in l+1 to n:

           current_max = max(current_max, a[r-1])

           current_min = min(current_min, a[r-1])

           pre[l][r] = current_max - current_min

   But this is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=200.

4. Now, set up the DP. Let's use a list of lists, where dp[i][s] is the number of ways to split the first i students (1-based) into groups, with sum s.

   But in code, the indices can be 0-based. Let's adjust.

   Let the students be 0-based (0 to n-1). Then, for l and r in 0-based (0<=l <=r <n), pre[l][r] is the imbalance of the group from l to r (inclusive).

   So, precompute for all l and r, 0<=l <=r <n:

       pre[l][r] = max(a[l..r]) - min(a[l..r])

   This can be computed as follows:

   n = len(a)

   pre = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

   for l in range(n):

       current_max = a[l]

       current_min = a[l]

       pre[l][l] = 0

       for r in range(l+1, n):

           current_max = max(current_max, a[r])

           current_min = min(current_min, a[r])

           pre[l][r] = current_max - current_min

   Now, for the DP:

   dp is a list of dictionaries or lists. Since for each step, we need to track sums up to k, using lists is better.

   So, dp is a list of arrays where dp[i][s] represents the number of ways to split the first i students into groups with sum s.

   Initialize dp[0] = [0]*(k+1), and dp[0][0] = 1.

   Then, for each i from 1 to n:

       dp[i] is a new array of zeros.

       for j in 0 to i-1:

           # the group is j to i-1 (since students are 0-based, and i represents the first i students)

           # wait, no. Wait, the code is a bit confusing. Let's think again.

           Let me re-express the DP:

           The DP[i] represents the first i students (0-based up to i-1). So for example, i=0 means no students, i=1 means the first student (index 0), i=2 means first two students (indices 0 and 1), etc.

           For each i (number of students processed), we can split into groups where the last group starts at j (number of students processed before) and ends at i-1.

           So j can range from 0 to i-1.

           For each j, the group is the students from j to i-1. The imbalance of that group is pre[j][i-1].

           Then, for each possible sum_prev in dp[j], if sum_prev + imbalance <=k, then add dp[j][sum_prev] to dp[i][sum_prev + imbalance].

           So the transitions are:

               for each j in 0..i-1:

                   imbalance = pre[j][i-1]

                   for s_prev in 0..k:

                       if s_prev + imbalance >k: continue

                       dp[i][s_prev + imbalance] += dp[j][s_prev]

                       dp[i][s_prev + imbalance] %= MOD

           So the DP for i students is built by considering all possible j (previous split points) and adding the imbalance of the new group (j to i-1) to the sum.

           The base case is dp[0][0] =1.

   So in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 +7

    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    # Precompute the imbalances

    n_students = len(a)

    pre = [[0]*n_students for _ in range(n_students)]

    for l in range(n_students):

        current_max = a[l]

        current_min = a[l]

        pre[l][l] = 0

        for r in range(l+1, n_students):

            current_max = max(current_max, a[r])

            current_min = min(current_min, a[r])

            pre[l][r] = current_max - current_min

    # Now DP

    dp = [ [0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n_students +1) ]

    dp[0][0] =1

    for i in range(1, n_students +1):

        # i is the number of students processed (0..i-1)

        for j in range(0, i):

            # group is from j to i-1 (inclusive)

            if j < i-1:

                imbalance = pre[j][i-1]

            else:

                # single student, imbalance 0

                imbalance =0

            # Now, for each possible sum_prev in dp[j]

            for s_prev in range(k+1):

                if dp[j][s_prev] ==0:

                    continue

                s_new = s_prev + imbalance

                if s_new >k:

                    continue

                dp[i][s_new] = (dp[i][s_new] + dp[j][s_prev]) % MOD

    # The answer is the sum of dp[n_students][s] for s in 0..k

    total = sum(dp[n_students][s] for s in range(k+1)) % MOD

    print(total, file=output_stream)

Another sample: sample 3:

Input 4 0.

Students must be in individual groups, so the only way is each in their own group. So the answer is 1.

In this case, the pre array for all groups of size 1 will have 0 imbalance. For groups of size >1, their imbalance is (max - min) which is non-zero. So during the DP, any split that has a group of size >=2 will add to the sum, which must not exceed 0. So the only valid splits are those where all groups are size 1.

Thus, the DP transitions would only allow j=i-1 (each step adding a single student group). So for each i, j must be i-1, and the group is of size 1 (imbalance 0). So the sum remains 0. The answer is 1.

Thus, the code should handle this correctly.

Now, the code seems correct. Let's see about the data structures.

In Python, using a 2D list for dp is manageable. For each i, the code loops j from 0 to i-1. For each j, it checks all possible s_prev in the dp[j] array. Then, for each s_prev, if adding the imbalance of the group j to i-1 is <=k, then add to dp[i][s_new].

But for each i, j can be up to i-1. So for each i, j runs i times. For each j, the code loops through k+1 possibilities. So for n=200, total steps are 200 * 200 * 1e3 =4e7, which should be manageable in Python.

But in practice, for each j and i, the inner loop runs through 1e3 elements. So 4e7 iterations, each doing a few operations. However, Python is slower, but 2 seconds may be enough. Let's see: 1e8 operations take about 10 seconds in Python, but 4e7 would take about 0.4 seconds. So it's acceptable.

But perhaps we can optimize further. For example, for each j, we can precompute the possible s_prev values and iterate only over those that are non-zero. So instead of looping through all 0..k for each j, we can track for each j the s_prev where dp[j][s_prev] is non-zero. But in Python, even that may not be faster, as checking for non-zero can take time. Alternatively, since the DP[j] is stored as a list, even if many entries are zero, the code still has to loop through all possible s_prev.

But given that k is 1e3, looping through 1e3 entries per j is manageable.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's code it.

The code structure:

Read n and k.

Read a as a list.

Precompute the pre array.

Initialize dp as a list of lists.

Loop over i from 1 to n (number of students processed).

For each i, loop j from 0 to i-1.

Compute the group from j to i-1 (students j to i-1 inclusive).

Compute the imbalance as pre[j][i-1].

Then, for each s_prev in 0..k:

   if dp[j][s_prev] is non-zero, and s_prev + imbalance <=k, then add to dp[i][s_prev + imbalance].

Finally, sum all dp[n][s] for s up to k.

Edge Cases:

n=1: the only way is to have one group. The imbalance is 0. So if k>=0, the answer is 1.

Test case where a is sorted, but the groups can be split in various ways.

Another test case: when k is large enough to allow all possible splits. The number of possible splits is 2^(n-1) (since each split is a choice of inserting a split between students). For example, for n=3, there are 4 splits: {0}, {1}, {2}; {0,1}, {2}; {0}, {1,2}; {0,1,2}.

But the code should compute the sum of all possible splits where the total imbalance is <=k. So when k is large enough, the answer is 2^(n-1). For example, n=3, k=1e3. The sum is 4.

But if the a array is such that every possible group has imbalance 0 (all elements the same), then all possible splits are allowed, so the answer is 2^(n-1).

So code must handle that.

But when all elements are the same, the pre array is 0 for all intervals. So during the DP steps, for each j and i, the imbalance is 0. So all transitions are allowed. Thus, the number of splits is the sum of all possible ways to split into groups, which is indeed 2^(n-1). So for example, when n=3, the answer is 4.

But according to the code, the answer would be computed as the sum over dp[n][s], which is the sum of all possible s up to k. Since all splits have s=0, the sum would be the number of splits, which is 2^(n-1).

So the code should handle that.

Thus, the code is correct.
