<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

So, the problem is about Mr. Kitayuta jumping between islands to collect gems. The islands are numbered from 0 to 30000. He starts at 0 and jumps to d first. Then each subsequent jump can be l-1, l, or l+1, where l is the previous jump length. But the jump length must be positive. The goal is to find the maximum number of gems he can collect along his path.

Hmm, the key here is to model all possible paths he can take and track the maximum gems collected. But with the constraints of n and d up to 30000, a brute-force approach like BFS might not work because the number of possible states could be too large. So I need to find a dynamic programming approach here.

Let me think about the possible states. Each state depends on the current position and the last jump length. Because the next jump depends on the previous jump's length. So the state can be represented as (current_position, last_length). For each such state, we can track the maximum number of gems collected up to that point.

But what's the maximum possible current_position? Since the islands go up to 30000, and each jump adds at least 1 (since the length is positive), the maximum possible position could be up to 30000. But considering that after each jump, the position increases by the current length, but the length can vary by ±1 each step. So the positions could be up to 30000.

The maximum possible last_length would be up to something like d + number_of_jumps. But since each jump can change the length by +1, the maximum possible length could be up to d + k where k is the number of jumps. But since the position can't exceed 30000, perhaps the maximum possible last_length is around 30000. Wait, but that's not possible. Let's see: for example, starting with d, then next jumps could be up to d+1, d+2, etc. But the sum would be d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... which would quickly exceed 30000. So perhaps the possible last_length values are bounded.

Wait, but in reality, the last_length can't be larger than the current position. Because each jump adds at least 1 to the position. For example, the first jump is d, so position becomes d. Then next jump can be d-1, d, d+1. Suppose we take d+1 each time. Then the position increases by d, then d+1, then d+2, etc. The sum after k steps would be d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... + (d + k -1). But this sum could reach 30000. So the maximum possible last_length would be up to 30000.

But even so, if we model the DP as a 2D array where the dimensions are current_position and last_length, the size would be 30000 * 30000, which is 900 million. That's way too big for memory, even with optimizations. So this approach is not feasible.

We need a smarter way. Let's think about possible optimizations.

Notice that for a given current position, the last_length can't be arbitrary. Because the last_length is the length of the jump that got you there. So for example, if you are at position x, the last_length must be such that the previous position was x - l, and the jump from x - l to x had length l. So for each x, possible l values are those that could have been part of the previous steps.

But even with that, for each x, the possible l values might be limited. For example, when you reach x, the possible l's are up to x (since each jump must be at least 1, so the previous jump could have been as small as 1, leading to x being the sum of previous jumps plus the last one). But this might not help directly.

Another observation: the maximum possible last_length when at position x is x (since you could have jumped from 0 to x in one step). But that's only possible if x is the first jump. Wait, no. The first jump is fixed to d. So the initial state after the first jump is position d, last_length d.

So from there, each subsequent jump can vary by ±1. So the possible last_length values for later steps are derived from adding -1, 0, or +1 to the previous length.

So the possible lengths after k jumps could be in the range [d - k, d + k], but this is a rough estimate. However, considering that each step can change the length by at most +1, the maximum possible length after m steps is d + m, but each step's length must be at least 1. Wait, but each step's length must be positive. So when you have a current length l, the next length can be l-1, l, l+1. But l-1 must be positive, so if l is 1, you can't choose l-1. So the possible lengths can't drop below 1.

So for the DP state, the possible l values for a given position x could be in a certain range. But how do we model this efficiently?

Alternative approach: Use a dynamic programming table where for each position x, we track the maximum number of gems for each possible last_length that could reach x. But since storing all possible l's for each x is memory-heavy, perhaps we can find that for x, the possible l's are bounded by a certain range.

Another observation: The maximum possible l for position x is x. Because if you jump from 0 to x, the l is x. But after that, each jump can only vary by ±1. So for example, after the first jump d, the next possible l's are d-1, d, d+1. Then next steps add or subtract 1 again. So for position x, the possible l's are in a range that's up to x, but the actual possible l's are determined by the path taken to reach x.

This suggests that for each position x, the possible l's are up to x, but that's not helpful. So perhaps we can model the DP with a dictionary for each x, storing the maximum gems for each possible l. But even this might not be efficient for x up to 3e4.

Alternatively, considering that the possible l's for x can't be more than x (since you can't have a jump length larger than the current position if you start from 0), but even then, it's unclear.

Wait, the first jump is d. So after that, each jump's length is varying by ±1. So the possible l's for a position x can be derived from the possible previous l's. For example, if the previous l was l_prev, then the next l can be l_prev - 1, l_prev, l_prev + 1. But l_prev -1 must be positive.

Hmm. So the DP transitions would be:

For a state (x, l), the next possible states are (x + next_l, next_l), where next_l is in {l-1, l, l+1}, provided that next_l > 0.

So the problem is to track the maximum number of gems collected when reaching x with a last jump length l.

Now, the initial state is (d, d), and the initial gem count is the sum of gems at 0 and d. Wait, no: the process starts at 0, so he collects any gems on 0. Then jumps to d, collects those, then continues. Wait, the problem statement says "he will collect the gems on the islands visited during the process." So the visited islands include 0, then d, then all subsequent positions he jumps to.

So the initial gem count is the count at 0 plus the count at d, plus the count of all the subsequent positions he jumps to.

Wait, but in the input, the gems are given as p_i. For example, in the first sample input, the first gem is on 10 (d=10), so when he jumps to 10, he collects that gem. Then he jumps to 19 (so that's 10 + 9, which is l=10-1=9?), but the sample explanation shows the first jump is 10, then next is 19 (so jump length 9). Then from 19, the next jump is 8, leading to 27. So the gem there is collected.

So, the first step is to process all the positions he visits, starting from 0, then d, then each next position as per the jump rules.

So the gems collected are the sum of the number of gems at each of those positions.

So to model the problem, we can precompute the count of gems for each island. So for each x in 0 to 30000, count[x] is the number of gems on x.

Then, the DP state (current position, last jump length l) will track the maximum number of gems collected up to that point.

The transitions are: from (x, l), we can jump to x + (l-1), x + l, x + l+1, provided that the new position is <=30000 and the new jump lengths (l-1, l, l+1) are positive.

So the initial state is (0, 0) but the first jump is fixed to d. Wait, no: according to the process, the first jump is from 0 to d. So he starts at 0, then jumps to d. So the initial state after the first step is (d, d), and he has collected gems at 0 and d.

Wait, no. Because the first step is the first jump. The process is:

He starts at 0. Then, the first jump is to d. So he visits 0 and d.

Then, the next jumps depend on the previous length (d). So for each subsequent step, he can choose l-1, l, l+1 as the next jump length, provided that the new length is positive.

So the initial state is (d, d), and the gems collected so far include 0 and d.

Wait, but the problem says that the gems are located on the islands visited during the process. So the initial position 0 is part of the process, then d, then each subsequent position. So the count includes all these positions.

So the first thing to do is to precompute the number of gems on each island. Then, the initial count is count[0] + count[d]. Then, for each subsequent step, adding the count for the new positions.

So the DP approach is to model the current position and the last jump length, tracking the maximum number of gems collected so far.

The DP transitions are as follows:

For a state (current_pos, l), the next possible jumps are to current_pos + next_l, where next_l is l-1, l, l+1, but next_l must be >0. Then, for each possible next_l, the next state is (current_pos + next_l, next_l), and the gems collected would be the current gem count plus the count of the new position (current_pos + next_l). We need to track the maximum possible gems for each state.

The base case is (d, d) with gems collected as count[0] + count[d].

But wait, the first step is from 0 to d. So the initial state is (d, d), and the count includes 0 and d.

So the DP approach would start from (d, d), and then for each possible state (current_pos, l), we explore the three possible transitions.

The problem is to find the maximum gems collected along any possible path.

So the approach is to model this with dynamic programming, where dp[x][l] represents the maximum number of gems collected when reaching x with a last jump of length l.

Now, the challenge is to manage the DP table efficiently. Considering that x can be up to 3e4 and l can be up to x (but perhaps up to 3e4), the table size is O(3e4 * 3e4) = 9e8, which is way too big for memory. So we need a way to optimize this.

Alternative idea: For each position x, the possible l's are not arbitrary. Since each jump changes the previous l by at most 1, the possible l's for position x are in a range around the initial d, but how?

Wait, the maximum possible l for a given x can be determined. For example, if the initial l is d, then each next l can vary by ±1. So the l's can be up to d + t, where t is the number of jumps made. But the number of jumps is limited by how far you can go. For example, the minimal step is l-1 each time, so after each step, the position increases by l. But if l decreases by 1 each time, then after k steps, the total distance would be d + (d-1) + (d-2) + ... + (d - k +1). But this sum must be <=30000.

But even so, this approach might not help directly. However, perhaps for each x, the possible l's are up to some value, but perhaps for x, the maximum possible l is around sqrt(2x) or something. Not sure.

Alternative approach: For each position x and l, the next possible positions are x + (l-1), x + l, x + l+1, and their l's are l-1, l, l+1. So we can model this with BFS, tracking the maximum gems collected for each (x, l) state, using a dictionary or a list of lists.

But even with BFS, if there are O(3e4) positions and O(3e4) l's for each, the total number of states is 3e4 * 3e4 = 9e8, which is way too big.

Hmm. So we need a smarter way. Let's think about possible pruning.

Suppose that for a given position x and l, if there's another way to reach x with l' and a higher gem count, then we can ignore the state (x, l) with lower gem counts. So in other words, for each (x, l), we only need to track the maximum gem count. So in the DP, we can process states in a way that we only keep the best possible value for each (x, l).

But even so, the problem is that the number of states is too large.

Alternative idea: For each position x, the maximum possible l is x, but that's not true. For example, the first jump is d, so l is d. Then next l can be d-1, d, d+1. Then the next positions could be d + (d-1), d +d, etc. So for x = d + (d-1), the l would be (d-1). But this depends on the path.

Another observation: when l is larger than some value, say l_max, then even if you jump l+1 each time, the positions would exceed 30000 quickly. So for x up to 3e4, the possible l's for x can't be larger than x's current position. Wait, but the sum of jumps up to a certain point could be much larger. Wait, no. Because each jump is from the previous position. So after each step, the new position is x + l_new, where l_new is the jump length. So for example, if the first jump is d (position d), then the next jump is l_new which is d-1, d, or d+1. So the next position is d + (d-1), d +d, or d + (d+1). The maximum possible l_new here is d+1. Then the next jump could be (d+1)+1 = d+2, leading to position (d +d+1) + (d+2) = 3d+3. But this could be up to 3e4.

So the possible l's can be up to d + m, where m is the number of steps taken. But the maximum possible m is such that the sum of the jumps is up to 3e4. The worst case is when each jump increases by 1. For example, the first jump is d, then d+1, d+2, etc. The sum after k steps would be d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... + (d +k -1) = k*d + (k(k-1))/2. Setting this sum to 3e4:

k*d + (k^2 -k)/2 ≈ 3e4. For d=3e4, k would be 0 (only the first jump). For d=1, it's a sum of 1+2+3+...+k = k(k+1)/2. So solving k^2 ~ 6e4 gives k ~ 245. So even for small d, the number of steps is around 245. So the possible l's after k steps can be up to d +k. So for k up to 3e2, the possible l's would be up to 3e4 + 3e2, which is manageable.

Wait, this is a key insight. The maximum possible number of steps (jumps) Mr. Kitayuta can make is limited. Because each jump adds at least 1 to the position, but after each step, the next jump's length can decrease by 1. Wait, no. If you take the minimal possible steps. For example, initial l = d. Then next l can be d-1, then d-2, etc. So the minimal number of steps is when l decreases by 1 each step until l=1. Then the next step can't decrease further (since l-1=0 is invalid). So the number of steps here would be (d-1) steps (from initial l=d to l=1). Then the next step can be l=0 which is invalid. So the total steps after the first jump would be d steps. For example, if d is 3e4, that's 3e4 steps, which is way too much. So this approach can't be applied.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach of using DP is not feasible for the given constraints. Then I need to find another way.

Alternative idea: The maximum possible l after the first jump is d. Each subsequent l can be up to d + k steps. But given that the position can't exceed 3e4, the possible l's for each position x can't be too large. For example, when x is 3e4, the l can't be larger than 3e4 (since the next jump would take you beyond 3e4). Wait, not exactly. The l can be up to (3e4 - x), but only if that's possible. For example, if x is 3e4 - 1, then l can be 1. But for x=3e4, l can't be anything, because you can't jump anymore.

Wait, perhaps for each position x, the maximum possible l is up to x. Because the previous jump was l, and x = previous_pos + l. So the previous_pos must be x - l, which is >=0. So l can be up to x, but that's not possible in the actual steps.

But in the DP, for a state (x, l), the l must be such that x - l >=0 and the previous step was a jump of l. So l can't be larger than x. Because the previous position was x - l. So the maximum possible l for any x is x. So for x up to 3e4, l can be up to x. But this still leaves 3e4 * 3e4 possible states, which is too much.

But perhaps for a given x, the possible l's are not that many. Let's see. For example, x=100, possible l's could be in a range around d, but after a certain number of steps. So the l's would vary but perhaps in a way that for each x, the possible l's are not that many. But how?

Alternative approach: Let's model the DP using a dictionary for each x, which maps l to the maximum gem count. For example, for each x, we only keep track of l's that are possible to reach x with. Then, during the transitions, we process each x in order and update the next possible positions.

But even this would require O(3e4) x steps, and each x may have a few possible l's. But how many l's per x?

Another observation: The possible l's for a given x can be up to x, but since the previous l could have been l_prev, which is either l+1, l, or l-1. So the l's for x can be in a certain range. For example, after k steps, the possible l's are in [d -k, d +k]. However, since each step can't decrease l by more than 1, the minimal possible l after k steps is max(1, d -k). But this depends on the steps taken.

But given that the maximum x is 3e4, and the first step is d, perhaps the number of possible steps is up to around 3e4. But even then, the number of possible l's is up to 3e4.

Hmm. So maybe we need to find a way to represent the DP states in a way that is memory efficient, perhaps by using a 2D array but with optimized access.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible l's for a given x is small. For example, when x is 30000, the possible l's could be up to 30000, but that's not possible. Wait, the previous position would be x - l. So x - l must be >=0, so l <=x.

But again, that's 3e4 possible l's per x.

But perhaps, in practice, for each x, the possible l's are only a small subset. For example, after the first step, x=d and l=d. Then, the next possible positions are x + (d-1), d, d+1. So for x = d + (d-1), the l could be d-1, etc. But this depends on the path.

Alternatively, considering that each jump can change the l by at most 1, the possible l's for a given x are contiguous. So for example, if x is 100, possible l's could be in a range like 95 to 105. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can model the DP using a 1D array, where for each x, we track the best possible l's. Wait, perhaps for each x, we can track the maximum possible gem count for each possible l. But again, how?

Wait, perhaps for each x, the maximum possible l is up to around 2d. Because after a certain number of steps, the l can't increase indefinitely. For example, after each step, if you take l+1, then l increases by 1 each time. But the sum of jumps would quickly exceed 3e4. So for x up to 3e4, the maximum possible l is when the path is taken with l increasing as much as possible. Let's see: initial l is d. Then each next step increases l by 1. So the first jump is d, then l becomes d+1 (jumping to d + (d+1) = 2d+1), then l becomes d+2 (jumping to 2d+1 + d+2 = 3d+3), and so on. The sum after k steps is d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... + (d +k-1) = k*d + (k*(k-1))/2. We need this sum to be <=30000. For example, if d=3e4, then even the first jump (d=3e4) would take us to position 3e4. Any further jumps would exceed 3e4. So for d=3e4, the maximum possible l is 3e4, and the only possible x is 3e4.

But for d=1, the sum after k steps would be 1+2+3+...+k = k(k+1)/2. We need this to be <=3e4. Solving for k gives k ~ sqrt(2*3e4) ~ sqrt(6e4) ~ 245. So for d=1, the maximum possible l is 245.

So the maximum possible l for any x is up to around 500, perhaps? Then, for each x, the possible l's are in a limited range. So the total number of states would be 3e4 * 500 = 15e6, which is manageable.

Wait, but this depends on d. If d is 3e4, then l starts at 3e4 and the next steps would have to decrease. So the possible l's could be down to 1. For example, after 3e4 steps, l decreases by 1 each time. So l would be 3e4, 3e4-1, ..., 1. That's 3e4 possible l's. Which again is 3e4 * 3e4 states.

So this approach might not be feasible for larger d.

Alternative idea: Since each jump must be at least 1, the maximum possible l for a given x is x, but the minimal l is 1. However, the transitions for l are such that each step can change l by at most ±1. So for a given x and l, the previous l could have been l+1, l, or l-1. So for example, when processing x, for each possible l in x's possible l's, we can look back to x - l and check if there were l_prev values that could have led to l.

Wait, this seems like a way to reverse-engineer the transitions. Let's think: to reach x with l, the previous position was x - l. The previous l_prev must have been l-1, l, or l+1. Because the previous jump length must have been l_prev, and the current l is the previous l_prev ±1 or same.

So, for each x and l, the previous state could have been (x - l, l_prev) where l_prev is l-1, l, or l+1.

So, for the DP, the value dp[x][l] = max(dp[x - l][l_prev]) + count[x], where l_prev can be l-1, l, or l+1, and x - l must be >=0.

This way, we can compute dp[x][l] based on previous states.

But then, for each x, we can process all possible l's that could have been used to reach x. But how?

For example, to compute dp[x][l], we look at x-l and check if there were any states in x-l with l_prev equal to l-1, l, or l+1. The maximum of those plus the current count[x] is the value for dp[x][l].

But since we process x in order, from 0 to 30000, we can precompute all possible x's and l's.

But even this approach requires storing for each x and l the maximum gems. But how to manage the memory.

Another idea: Since for each x, l must be <= x (since x = previous_pos + l and previous_pos >=0), so l can be up to x. So for x up to 3e4, and l up to 3e4, the storage is 3e4 * 3e4, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Use a dictionary to store the current l's for each x. For example, for each x, we have a dictionary that maps possible l's to the maximum gem count. Then, for each x, we can iterate through possible l's and compute the transitions to x + (l-1), x + l, x + l+1. But this would be O(3e4 * average_l_per_x) steps. But with 3e4 * 3e4 steps, it's again not feasible.

But perhaps there's a way to bound the possible l's. For example, when x is large, the possible l's can't be too small. For example, if x is 3e4, then l must be at least 1 (since you can't jump 0), but the previous position was x - l, which must be >=0. So l can be up to x. So this doesn't help.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of the maximum possible steps. Let's say that the maximum number of steps (after the first jump) is k. Each step increases the l by 1. So the sum after k steps would be d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... + (d +k-1) = k*d + k(k-1)/2. Setting this sum <= 3e4.

For d=1, this sum is k(k+1)/2 <=3e4 → k ~ 244.

For d=30000, the first jump is 30000, and that's the maximum possible, so no more steps. So k=0.

So the maximum possible number of steps after the first jump is around 500. But this is only if the l is increasing. If the l is decreasing, the steps could be up to d steps (since l starts at d and decreases by 1 each step until l=1, leading to d steps).

But for d=3e4, that's 3e4 steps. Which again is not manageable.

So this approach is not helpful.

Alternative idea: Since the maximum possible number of steps is up to 3e4 (if d is 3e4), but each step's l can be represented as a function of the previous steps, perhaps there's a way to model this with memoization and pruning.

Another idea: The problem requires finding the maximum number of gems collected. So for each state (x, l), if there's another state (x, l') where l' > l and the gem count is higher, then perhaps l can be ignored. But this is not necessarily true. For example, a higher l may allow for longer jumps in the future, leading to more gems. So we can't prune states based on l.

Alternatively, if two states (x, l1) and (x, l2) have l1 < l2 and the gem count for l1 is <= gem count for l2, then l1 can be ignored because any future jumps from l1 would be smaller than those from l2, potentially leading to fewer opportunities. But this is not necessarily true, since l1 could allow for a longer jump (if the next step increases l) than l2 if l2's next step is decreased. So this line of thinking is not helpful.

Another observation: The maximum possible gems is the sum of all gems in the islands visited. So if there's a way to collect all gems, but that's unlikely. So the goal is to maximize the count. So perhaps for each x, the best possible l is the one that gives the highest gem count, regardless of the l. But again, this depends on future steps.

Alternatively, for each x, we can track the maximum possible gem count, regardless of l, and use that to compute future steps. But this is not possible, because the l determines the next possible jumps.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. Let's think of the problem differently.

Let's consider that the maximum possible l for any x is bounded by 2*sqrt(2x). This is because the sum of the first k steps' l's (after the first jump) is x, and if l increases each step, then the sum is O(k^2), so k is O(sqrt(x)). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum possible l for a given x can be up to x, but in practice, the number of possible l's for x is O(sqrt(x))). But this is a conjecture.

But even if that's the case, for x=3e4, sqrt(x) is ~173, leading to 3e4 * 173 = 5e6 states, which is manageable.

So, perhaps we can proceed with a DP approach, using a dictionary for each x to track the possible l's and their maximum gem counts. For each x, when processing it, we look at all possible l's for that x, and compute the next positions (x + next_l) with next_l in {l-1, l, l+1}, provided next_l>0.

But how do we manage this efficiently?

Let me outline the steps:

1. Precompute the count array, where count[x] is the number of gems on island x. Initialize all counts to 0, then read the input and increment count[p_i] for each gem.

2. Initialize a DP structure. Since the initial state is (d, d) with gem count count[0] + count[d], we can start by setting dp[d][d] = count[0] + count[d].

3. For each possible x in order from d to 30000, process all l's in dp[x], and for each (x, l), compute the next possible jumps. For each next_l in {l-1, l, l+1}:

   a. If next_l <=0, skip.

   b. next_pos = x + next_l.

   c. If next_pos > 30000, skip.

   d. The new gem count is dp[x][l] + count[next_pos].

   e. If next_pos is not in the DP structure, add it with a new dictionary entry for next_l.

   f. Otherwise, if the existing entry for next_l in next_pos's dictionary is less than the new gem count, update it.

4. After processing all x's, the maximum gem count is the maximum value across all entries in the DP structure.

But how to process the x's in order? Because when you process x, you need to have already processed all possible previous x's. But in this case, the transitions are forward, so we can process x in increasing order. For each x, after processing it, generate the next x's (x + next_l) and update their entries.

But this may not capture all possible transitions. For example, when processing x, the next positions could be x + (l-1), x + l, x + l+1. So these next_pos are larger than x, so we can process x in order from 0 to 3e4, and for each x, process its transitions to higher positions.

So the algorithm would be:

- Initialize a dictionary (or list of dictionaries) for each x.

- Start with x=d, l=d, with gem count = count[0] + count[d].

- Then, for each x from d to 3e4:

   - For each l in dp[x]:

      - Compute next_l's (l-1, l, l+1).

      - For each next_l:

         - if next_l <=0: skip.

         - next_pos = x + next_l.

         - if next_pos >3e4: skip.

         - new_gem = dp[x][l] + count[next_pos].

         - if next_pos is not in the DP structure, add next_l to its dictionary with new_gem.

         - else, check if next_l's existing gem count is less than new_gem. If so, update.

- Finally, find the maximum value across all entries in the DP structure.

This way, we process each x in order, and for each l in x's possible l's, we generate the next possible positions and update their dp entries.

The key is that for x, we process it once, and all transitions from x are handled in this step. Since next_pos is greater than x, we process them in order, ensuring that when x is processed, all previous x's have been processed.

But this approach may miss some transitions where next_pos is processed before x is processed. Wait, no. Because next_pos is x + next_l. Since x is processed in increasing order, next_pos will be >=x + (l-1) (since next_l is at least l-1, which can be as low as 1 if l is 2). Wait, but the processing order is x from d to 3e4. For example, if x is 100, then next_pos could be 100+99=199 (if l is 100 and next_l is 99). But when x is 100, we process it, then next_pos is 199. Then, when x reaches 199, we process it. So this seems correct.

But the problem is that, for a given x, there may be multiple entries (l's) that can reach it. So the order in which the l's are processed for x may affect the maximum gem count.

But the algorithm processes all l's for x and updates the next_pos's entries. So for each next_pos, when x is processed, all possible transitions from x to next_pos are considered, and the maximum gem count is kept.

So this approach should work.

Now, the next step is to implement this.

But how to represent the DP structure. For Python, using a list of dictionaries would be efficient. For example, dp is a list where each index x is a dictionary of {l: max_gems}.

Initialize dp as a list of empty dictionaries, of size 3e4+1.

Then, after the initial step, set dp[d][d] = count[0] + count[d].

Then, for x in d to 3e4:

   for l in dp[x]:

      current_gem = dp[x][l]

      for delta in (-1, 0, 1):

          next_l = l + delta

          if next_l <=0:

              continue

          next_pos = x + next_l

          if next_pos > 30000:

              continue

          new_gem = current_gem + count[next_pos]

          # update dp[next_pos] for next_l

          if next_l not in dp[next_pos] or dp[next_pos][next_l] < new_gem:

              dp[next_pos][next_l] = new_gem

Then, after processing all x, find the maximum value among all dictionaries in dp.

But considering that some x's may not be visited, we need to iterate through all x's and their l's.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

4 10

10

21

27

27

So count[0] = 0 (no gems at 0?), wait no. Wait, the input says the first gem is p_i >=d. So in this sample, the first jump is to 10, which has a gem. So count[10] is 1, count[21] is 1, count[27] is 2.

But wait, the initial jump is to 10, and the first state is (10, 10) with gem count 0 (from 0) + 1 (from 10) = 1. Then, the next steps:

For x=10, l=10. Next possible l's are 9,10,11.

So next_pos is 10+9=19, 10+10=20, 10+11=21.

For each of these, new_gem is 1 + count[next_pos].

For next_pos=19: count is 0, so new_gem=1. Then, for next_pos=20: count is 0. Next_pos=21: count is 1. So for l=11 in next_pos=21, new_gem=2.

Now, when x=19 is processed, l=9. Next possible l's are 8,9,10. Next_pos would be 19+8=27, 19+9=28, 19+10=29.

At next_pos=27, count is 2. So new_gem would be 1 (current_gem at x=19, l=9) + 2 =3.

Then, when x=27 is processed, l=8. Next possible l's are 7,8,9. So next_pos is 27+7=34, etc. But the maximum gem count for x=27, l=8 is 3. Then, the next steps would add the count for 34 (0), but that's not helpful.

So the maximum gem count is 3, which matches the sample.

So the approach works for the first sample.

Now, let's think about the time and memory constraints.

In the worst case, for each x from d to 3e4, and each l in the dictionary of x, we process three possible next_l's. For each x, the number of l's depends on the steps taken. But for x up to 3e4, and l up to x, this could be O(3e4^2) operations, which is 9e8 steps. This would be way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.

But this approach is not feasible. So we need to find a way to optimize it.

Alternative observation: For a given x, the possible l's are constrained by the previous steps. For example, the l's can't be larger than x. Also, in practice, for larger x, the possible l's are not that many. For example, when x is 30000, the possible l's are those that could have been formed by previous steps. But even so, this is not helpful.

Another idea: The initial jump is fixed to d. So all possible l's after that are derived from d by adding or subtracting 1 at each step. So the possible l's for a given x can be represented as d ± k, where k is the number of steps. But this depends on the path.

But even so, this is not helpful for the algorithm.

Another optimization: Since the maximum possible l for a given x is x, and the minimal l is 1, perhaps we can represent each x's possible l's as a range from 1 to x, but using a list to track the maximum gems for each l. But for x up to 3e4, this would require 3e4 * 3e4 = 9e8 storage, which is impossible.

Alternative approach: Notice that the maximum possible l for a given x is the current x minus the previous position. But the previous position is x - l. So x - l must be >=0. So l <=x.

But this doesn't help with the storage.

Another Idea: Since each jump's l can only change by ±1 from the previous l, the possible l's for x can be derived from the possible l's of x - l. So for each x, the l's are in a range that is within ±1 of the l's of x - l. This suggests that for each x, the possible l's are a subset of the l's from x - l's previous l's plus delta.

But I'm not sure how to exploit this.

Alternative Idea: Use memoization and BFS with pruning. We can use a BFS approach, processing states (x, l) in order of their x. For each state, we track the maximum gems collected. If a state (x, l) is processed with a gem count that is less than or equal to a previously recorded gem count for (x, l), we can skip processing it.

This way, we avoid processing states that are worse than previously known states.

So the algorithm would:

1. Initialize a priority queue with (x=d, l=d), with gem count = count[0] + count[d].

2. Use a DP table (dictionary of dictionaries) to track the maximum gem count for each (x, l).

3. Process the queue in order of increasing x (since transitions are forward, we process x in order).

4. For each (x, l) in the queue:

   a. For each next_l in l-1, l, l+1:

      i. If next_l <=0, skip.

      ii. next_pos = x + next_l.

      iii. If next_pos >3e4, skip.

      iv. new_gem = dp[x][l] + count[next_pos].

      v. If next_pos's current dp entry for next_l is less than new_gem, update it and add (next_pos, next_l) to the queue.

But the problem is that the same (x, l) can be added multiple times, but once processed, we can ignore further entries for it if the new gem count is not higher than the existing one.

This is similar to the BFS approach with a priority queue ordered by x, and for each (x, l), only process it once with the maximum gem count.

But in Python, this can be implemented using a deque, processing x in order. For each x, process all possible l's for that x, then process the next x.

But how to ensure that when we process x, all possible l's for x have been considered.

Alternatively, process x in increasing order. For each x, when you process it, you have all the possible l's for that x stored in the DP table. Then, when you process x, you can generate the next_pos for each l, and update their DP entries.

This is similar to the initial approach, but with the processing order of x being from d to 3e4.

This approach is manageable, but in the worst case, it's O(3e4 * 3e4) operations, which is 9e8 steps. Python can't handle that in 1 second (1e8 steps per second is the usual estimation).

But in practice, perhaps the number of l's per x is not that large, especially for higher x. For example, when x is 3e4, the possible l's can only be up to 3e4, but how many of them are actually reachable?

Alternatively, for the problem constraints, perhaps the optimal solution uses a greedy approach. For example, making the largest possible jumps (i.e., increasing l each step) to reach as far as possible and collect as many gems as possible. But this is not necessarily true, as seen in the third sample input.

But this approach might not work. For example, in the third sample, the optimal path is to jump with lengths 7 (first), then 6 (7-1), then 5 (6-1), then 6 (5+1), then 6 (6+0), leading to positions 7, 13, 18, 24, 30. This path requires decreasing the l initially, then increasing it again.

So a greedy approach of always increasing l would not find this path.

Thus, the DP approach seems necessary.

But how to optimize it.

Alternative Idea: Use memoization with limited l's for each x.

For example, for each x, the possible l's are in a certain range around the previous l's. For example, when x increases, the possible l's are around the previous l's ±1.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The maximum number of possible l's for any x is O(sqrt(x)). For example, the sum of the first k jumps is O(k^2), so x is O(k^2). So the number of jumps k is O(sqrt(x)). Each jump can have l varying by ±1, so the number of possible l's per x is O(k) = O(sqrt(x)). For x up to 3e4, sqrt(x) is ~173, so total steps would be 3e4 * 173 = 5e6, which is manageable.

But how to prove this.

Alternatively, for x, the possible l's are bounded by a small range around d. For example, if d is 10, then the possible l's for x=100 could be up to 10 + 100 steps, but this is not possible. So this is not helpful.

But perhaps the possible l's for x can't be more than d + x/d. Because if you take the largest possible jumps each time. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since each step can change the l by at most 1, the maximum possible l after m steps is d + m. But the sum of the first m steps (after the initial jump) would be d + (d+1) + (d+2) + ... + (d+m-1) = m*d + (m(m-1))/2. For this sum to be <=3e4:

If d=1, then m^2/2 ~3e4 → m~ 244. So the maximum l is 1+244=245.

If d=3e4, then m=0 steps after initial jump. So l remains 3e4.

So for d up to 3e4, the maximum possible l is d + m, where m is up to around 244.

So the possible l's for any x can't be more than d + 244.

So for each x, the possible l's are up to d + 244, which is around 3e4 + 244. But even this is 3e4 * 3e4 steps.

But wait, for d=3e4, the maximum l is 3e4, and the initial jump is to x=3e4. No further jumps are possible. So the possible l's are 3e4.

So for large d, the l's are small.

But for small d, the l's can be up to 3e4. So this approach isn't helpful.

Alternative Idea: For each x, the possible l's are in a range of [current_l_min, current_l_max], and for each step, this range is updated. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a way to implement the DP approach with the best possible optimizations.

Let's think about the initial approach and see if it can be implemented efficiently.

In Python, using a list of dictionaries:

Initialize a list dp where dp[x] is a dictionary of {l: max_gems}.

Initialize count[x] for all x.

Set count[0] to include any gems on 0. Wait, the problem says that the gems are given as p_i where p_i >=d. But according to the input description: "d ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ ... ≤ pn ≤ 30000". Wait, no. The input says:

"The next n lines describe the location of the gems. The i-th of them (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains a integer pi (d ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ ... ≤ pn ≤ 30000), denoting the number of the island that contains the i-th gem."

So the gems are all on islands >=d. So count[0] is zero. So the first jump is to d, which may have gems. But the initial position is 0, which is visited, and collects any gems there. But according to the input constraints, there are no gems on 0, since p_i >=d >=1.

Wait, the input constraints for pi: d <= p1 <= p2 <= ... <= pn <=30000. So p_i >=d. So count[0] is zero. The first gem is on d.

So the initial gem count is count[0] (0) + count[d] (number of gems on d).

So in the first sample, the gems are on 10, 21, 27, 27. So count[10] is 1, count[21] is 1, count[27] is 2.

So the initial state is (d=10, l=10) with gem count 0 + count[10] =1.

Then, processing x=10, l=10:

 next_l can be 9,10,11.

 next_pos is 19, 20, 21.

 For each of these:

- next_pos=19: count[19] is 0 → new_gem=1.

- next_pos=20: count[20] is 0 → new_gem=1.

- next_pos=21: count[21] is 1 → new_gem=2.

So dp[19][9] = 1, dp[20][10]=1, dp[21][11] =2.

Then processing x=19:

 l=9.

 next_l can be 8,9,10.

 next_pos: 19+8=27, 19+9=28, 19+10=29.

 count[27] is 2 → new_gem=1+2=3.

 count[28] is 0 → new_gem=1.

 count[29] is 0 → new_gem=1.

 So dp[27][8] =3, etc.

Processing x=21:

 l=11.

 next_l can be 10, 11, 12.

 next_pos: 21+10=31, 21+11=32, 21+12=33.

 count[31] is 0, etc. So new_gem=2 + 0=2.

So, the maximum gem count is 3.

So the algorithm works.

Now, considering the constraints, let's think about the maximum possible states.

For d=30000:

Initial x=30000, l=30000.

No further jumps, since next_pos would be 30000 + 29999=59999 (exceeds 3e4), etc. So the DP for x=30000 has only one entry, and no transitions.

So for d=30000, the algorithm processes x=30000, and nothing else. So it's efficient.

For d=1:

Initial x=1, l=1.

Then next_l can be 0 (invalid), 1, 2. So next_pos 2 (l=1), 3 (l=2).

For x=2, l=1:

next_l can be 0 (invalid), 1, 2. So next_pos 3 (l=1),4 (l=2),5 (l=3).

But this can generate a lot of states, but the number of steps is manageable.

But for Python, even 5e6 steps would take around 1 second.

So perhaps the algorithm can pass within the time constraints.

Thus, the plan is to implement this approach.

Now, the code:

First, read n and d.

Then read the n p_i's, and build a count array.

Initialize count as a list of zeros of size 30001.

For each p in the input, increment count[p] by 1.

Then, initialize the DP.

dp is a list of dictionaries. For x in 0 to 30000, dp[x] is a dictionary.

Then, initial state is:

dp[d][d] = count[0] + count[d]. But count[0] is 0 (since p_i >=d >=1). So it's count[d].

Wait, wait. The process starts at 0, then jumps to d. So the visited islands are 0 and d. So the gem count is count[0] + count[d]. But according to the input constraints, count[0] is 0. So the initial gem count is count[d].

But according to the problem statement, the initial jump is from 0 to d. So 0 is visited, but there are no gems there. So the initial state's gem count is count[0] + count[d] = 0 + count[d].

Yes.

So code:

count = [0] * 30001

n, d = map(int, input().split())

for _ in range(n):
    p = int(input())
    count[p] += 1

dp = [dict() for _ in range(30001)]

initial_gem = count[0] + count[d]

dp[d][d] = initial_gem

max_gem = initial_gem

for x in range(d, 30001):
    if not dp[x]:
        continue
    for l in list(dp[x].keys()):  # Iterate over a copy to avoid modifying during iteration
        current_gem = dp[x][l]
        # Generate next_l's
        for delta in (-1, 0, 1):
            next_l = l + delta
            if next_l <= 0:
                continue
            next_pos = x + next_l
            if next_pos > 30000:
                continue
            new_gem = current_gem + count[next_pos]
            if new_gem > max_gem:
                max_gem = new_gem
            # Update dp[next_pos] if new_gem is better
            if next_l in dp[next_pos]:
                if dp[next_pos][next_l] < new_gem:
                    dp[next_pos][next_l] = new_gem
            else:
                dp[next_pos][next_l] = new_gem

print(max_gem)

But wait, this code initializes dp as a list of 30001 dictionaries. For each x from d to 30000, it processes the l's in dp[x]. For each l, it generates next_l's and updates the next_pos's dictionary.

But there's a problem: when processing x, the next_pos could be larger than x, but when x reaches next_pos, the code will process it. So this should be correct.

But in the code above, when we process x in a loop from d to 30000, we process each x once. For each x, we process all l's in its dictionary, generate the next_pos and update their dictionaries.

The code also tracks the max_gem as it processes each state.

This should work.

But what about the order of processing x? Since the loop processes x in order from d to 30000, and next_pos is x + next_l (which is larger than x), the next_pos will be processed in future iterations.

But the code is designed to process x in increasing order. So when x is processed, all possible transitions from x are handled, and the next_pos's dictionaries are updated.

Now, let's test the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

4 10

10

21

27

27

count[10] is 1, count[21] is 1, count[27] is 2.

initial_gem = 0 +1 =1.

dp[10][10] =1.

max_gem is 1.

Processing x=10:

l=10.

Generate next_l 9, 10, 11.

next_pos is 19,20,21.

new_gem is 1+count[19] =1+0=1; 1+0=1; 1+1=2.

So dp[19][9] =1, dp[20][10]=1, dp[21][11]=2. max_gem is now 2.

Processing x=19:

l=9.

next_l 8,9,10. next_pos=27, 28,29.

new_gem for 27 is 1+2=3. So max_gem becomes 3.

dp[27][8] =3.

Other next_pos's have new_gem=1+0=1.

Processing x=20: no entries (since dp[20] may have entries, but in this sample, it's not used.

Processing x=21:

l=11. next_l 10,11,12. next_pos=31, 32,33. These are all beyond 3e4, but next_pos=21+10=31 >3e4, so skipped.

So no updates.

Processing x=27:

l=8. next_l 7,8,9. next_pos=27+7=34, 27+8=35, 27+9=36. count[34] is 0, so new_gem=3+0=3. So no updates. max_gem remains 3.

So the code outputs 3, which is correct.

The code seems to handle this correctly.

Now, the code uses a list of dictionaries. For Python, dictionaries are efficient for sparse data. So for each x, only a few l's are stored.

Thus, the code should work within the time and memory constraints.

The code also tracks the maximum gem count as it goes, so after processing all states, it can output the max_gem.

Thus, this should be the correct approach.
