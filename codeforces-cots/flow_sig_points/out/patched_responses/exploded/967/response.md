<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says we need to find a permutation of the tree nodes such that the number of pairs (u, v) where a_u < a_lca < a_v is maximized. Oh right, lca is the lowest common ancestor of u and v. So the goal is to arrange the permutation in a way that this condition is satisfied as much as possible.

First, I need to figure out what's the maximum possible value of f(a). Let's think about the structure of the tree and how the permutation a affects the count.

Let me consider the example given. In the first test case, the tree is rooted at 1. The optimal permutation gives 4 pairs. The lca here for some pairs is the root. For example, pairs (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) have lca 1, and the values are such that the root's value is between the two. Then another pair (5,4) has their lca as 3. So it seems that arranging the nodes in a way that certain parent-child relationships have increasing or decreasing values might contribute to these pairs.

Wait, but how to model this. Let's think about the permutation. Each node's value in the permutation determines how it's ordered with its ancestors and descendants. The key is to maximize the number of pairs (u, v) where the lca's value is sandwiched between u and v's values.

Wait, maybe the optimal permutation arranges nodes such that along certain paths, the values are increasing or decreasing in a way that creates as many such pairs as possible.

Alternatively, maybe each node contributes some value based on the number of descendants and ancestors. Like, for a node x, if it's placed as the median in some triplet (u, x, v) where u is in one subtree and v in another, or something like that.

Hmm. Let's think about the structure. For any two nodes u and v, their lca is some node l. The condition a_u < a_l < a_v implies that the lca's value is between the two nodes. So for each such lca l, how many pairs (u, v) can we have where l is the lca of u and v, and a_u < a_l < a_v?

Alternatively, for a node l, the maximum possible pairs where l is the lca would depend on how many nodes in the subtree of l (excluding l's children) can be arranged such that some are larger and some are smaller than l's value.

Wait, perhaps for each node l, the number of pairs where l is the lca and the condition holds is the product of the number of nodes in two different subtrees of l. For example, if l has two children, then any u in one subtree and v in another would have l as their lca. Then, if a_l is between a_u and a_v, then if one is smaller and the other is larger than a_l, that counts as a pair.

Wait, but the permutation a is a permutation, so each value is unique. So for a node l, the number of pairs (u, v) where l is their lca and a_u < a_l < a_v is equal to the number of u in the left subtrees of l (i.e., in any of the subtrees but in a way that u is in one subtree and v in another) where a_u < a_l multiplied by the number of v in other subtrees of l where a_v > a_l. Because for each such u and v, their lca is l, and the condition is satisfied.

Alternatively, for node l, the maximum possible contribution is the product of the number of nodes in its left subtrees (those with a_u < a_l) and the number of nodes in the right subtrees (those with a_v > a_l). Because each u in left and v in right would contribute 1 if a_u < a_l < a_v.

So for each node l, the contribution to the total f(a) is the product of the sizes of two groups: the number of descendants (including in all subtrees) that are in the left part (a < a_l) and the right part (a > a_l). But how do these groups get split?

Wait, but the permutation is a permutation, so all the nodes except l must be assigned values either higher or lower than l. So for the node l, the maximum possible contribution would be when the number of nodes in the subtree (not sure exactly which subtree) that are arranged to be greater than l multiplied by those arranged to be smaller than l. But how to split the subtree into these two groups to maximize the product.

Wait, but the node l's subtree includes all its descendants. So suppose for node l, there are s nodes in its subtree (including itself). When we assign a_l to a certain position, the number of nodes in the subtree that are assigned a value lower than a_l would be k, and higher would be (s-1 -k) (since the subtree includes l itself, but l's value is fixed, so the remaining s-1 nodes are split into two groups). Wait, but the permutation is a permutation of all nodes. So for the entire tree, the values are 1 to n. For each node l, when choosing a value for it, the split of its subtree's nodes (excluding l) into those smaller and larger than a_l would affect the contribution.

But maybe for each node l, the maximum possible contribution is (s - 1) choose 1. Wait, no. Let's think: the maximum product of two numbers that sum to (s-1) is when they are as close as possible. So for s-1 nodes, the maximum product is floor((s-1)/2) * ceil((s-1)/2), which is the maximum possible product for two integers summing to s-1. For example, if s-1 is 4, then 2*2=4. If s-1 is 5, then 2*3=6.

But how does this relate to the problem. Because the subtree of l has s nodes (including l), so when we assign a_l a value, the other s-1 nodes (the descendants of l) must be arranged such that some are smaller than a_l and some larger. Then, the product of the count of smaller and larger nodes would contribute to the pairs where l is the lca.

Wait, but the lca for any pair of nodes u and v in the subtree of l is l only if they are in different subtrees of l. Because if u and v are in the same child subtree of l, then their lca is the lca of that subtree. So to have the lca be l, u and v must be in different subtrees of l. So for l, the number of pairs (u, v) where l is their lca is the sum over all pairs of different child subtrees of l of the product of the sizes of those subtrees. So, for example, if l has k children with subtree sizes s1, s2, ..., sk, then the total number of pairs with l as lca is sum_{i<j} s_i * s_j.

But for each such pair (u, v), the condition a_u < a_l < a_v (or a_v < a_l < a_u) would contribute 1 to the total f(a). So for each pair (u, v) where l is their lca, the condition requires that a_l is between a_u and a_v. So for the pair (u, v), either a_u < a_l < a_v or a_v < a_l < a_u. Thus, the maximum possible contribution for each such pair is 1 if a_l is placed between them, and 0 otherwise.

But how can we arrange the permutation to maximize the number of such pairs. Since each pair (u, v) must have a_l between their values, the optimal way is to split the descendants of l into two groups: those with a value less than a_l and those greater than a_l. Then, any pair where one is in the lower group and the other in the upper group would contribute 1 to the count. So the number of such pairs is the product of the sizes of the two groups.

Therefore, for each node l, the maximum possible contribution is the product of the number of descendants (not including l) that are in the lower group and upper group. The maximum product is achieved when the numbers are as balanced as possible, i.e., split the s-1 descendants into two groups as close as possible. So for s-1 descendants, the maximum product is floor((s-1)/2) * ceil((s-1)/2).

Wait, but that's the maximum possible product for a given s-1. So for each node l, the contribution to the total f(a) is floor((s-1)/2) * ceil((s-1)/2), where s is the size of the subtree rooted at l. Then, the total maximum f(a) is the sum over all nodes l of this value.

Is that correct? Because each pair (u, v) where l is their lca can be counted once in this way. For example, if the subtree of l has size s, then there are s-1 descendants. By splitting them into two groups as evenly as possible, the product is maximized. Each pair between the two groups contributes 1 to the count, as their lca is l. So the sum over all nodes of floor((s-1)/2) * ceil((s-1)/2) gives the total maximum f(a).

But how to verify this with the examples.

Let's take the first example input. The tree is:

1 is root.

1's children are 2 and 3.

3's children are 4 and 5.

So the subtree sizes are:

For node 1: 5 nodes (all nodes). So s-1=4. The product is 2*2=4.

For node 2: subtree size 1. So s-1=0. Product 0.

For node 3: subtree size 3. s-1=2. product 1*1=1.

Nodes 4 and 5: subtree size 1 each. Product 0.

So sum is 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 =5. But the sample output is 4. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but in the sample output, the answer is 4. So this suggests that my approach is wrong.

Hmm, that's confusing. So according to this approach, the sum would be 4+1=5 for the first example, but the sample answer is 4. So where is the mistake here.

Wait, maybe the subtree size for node 3 is 3 (nodes 3,4,5), so s-1 is 2. The product is 1*1=1. Then node 1's contribution is 4 (5 nodes, s-1=4, product 2*2=4). Sum is 4+1=5, but the sample output is 4. So why is that?

Hmm, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. So perhaps there's a flaw in the reasoning.

Let's look at the first sample. The output is 4. According to the sample explanation, there are 4 pairs. Let's see:

The pairs are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (5,4). Wait, how?

For the pair (2,3), lca is 1. So node 1's contribution here. Similarly for (2,4), (2,5): lca is 1.

The pair (5,4) has lca 3. So node 3's contribution here.

So according to the sample, node 1 contributes 3 pairs (since 2 is in one subtree, and 3,4,5 are in another). Wait, but according to the approach, node 1's contribution is 4. So where's the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the approach counts all possible pairs between the two groups. For example, if the subtree of 1 is split into two groups: 2 (size 1) and 3,4,5 (size 3). Then the product is 1 *3=3, which would be 3 pairs. But according to the approach's calculation, for s-1=4 (since the subtree of 1 is 5 nodes, s-1=4), the product is 2*2=4. So why is that?

Ah, I see. Because the approach I considered is splitting all s-1 descendants into two groups. But in reality, the split is not just between the immediate children of the node. For example, in node 1's case, the s-1 descendants are 2,3,4,5. The optimal split is two groups of 2 each. Then the product is 2*2=4. But how can that be possible?

Wait, but in the sample, the pairs (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are the ones where lca is 1. So those are three pairs, but according to the approach, node 1's contribution should be 4. So why the sample's count is 3 here?

Ah, perhaps the approach is incorrect. So my initial reasoning is flawed.

So perhaps the key is not just the product of the two groups, but the way the subtrees are structured. Let's think again.

The pairs (u, v) that have lca l are the pairs where u is in one subtree of l and v is in another subtree of l. For each such pair, the condition is a_u < a_l < a_v or a_v < a_l < a_u. So for each such pair, exactly one of the two possible orders would contribute. So the maximum possible pairs for l is the number of such pairs (u, v) multiplied by the probability that in the permutation, a_l is between a_u and a_v. But since we can choose the permutation, perhaps the maximum possible is the number of pairs (u, v) where l is their lca multiplied by 1, but that's only possible if the permutation can arrange that for all pairs, a_l is in between. But that's impossible because the permutation is a permutation, so for each pair (u, v), exactly one of the three possibilities holds: u < l < v, v < l < u, or l is not between them. But for a given pair (u, v), you can arrange a_l to be between them only if you assign a_l a value between a_u and a_v. But in the permutation, a_l's value is fixed once assigned. So for the pair (u, v) and their lca l, the maximum contribution is 1 if a_l is between a_u and a_v, else 0.

So for each such pair (u, v) with lca l, the maximum possible is 1. But how many such pairs can be achieved in the permutation.

If we arrange the permutation such that for all pairs (u, v) where l is their lca, a_l is between a_u and a_v, then the contribution for l would be the number of such pairs. But this may not be possible because for each u and v, the permutation has to satisfy a_u < a_l < a_v or a_v < a_l < a_u.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is the number of pairs (u, v) with lca l multiplied by the maximum possible probability, which in this case is 1. But that's not possible because if l has multiple children, then you can't arrange all pairs in such a way.

Wait, let's think of node l with two children. The pairs (u, v) where u is in child A's subtree and v is in child B's subtree. For each such pair, if a_l is between a_u and a_v, then it counts. But how can we arrange the permutation to maximize this.

Suppose we assign a_l a value that is the median of the subtree. Then, for all u in the subtree of l's children, half are less than a_l and half are greater. Then, the product of the number of u's in the left and right groups would give the maximum possible pairs.

Ah, this brings us back to the initial approach. So for each node l, the contribution is the number of pairs (u, v) where u and v are in different child subtrees of l multiplied by the maximum possible chance that a_l is between a_u and a_v, which depends on how the nodes are arranged. But by optimally arranging the permutation, the maximum possible contribution for l is the product of the number of nodes in the left and right groups of l's subtree. But how to model that.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is correct. Let's re-examine the first sample.

In the first sample, node 1's subtree has 5 nodes. So s-1=4. The maximum product is 2*2=4. So the contribution from node 1 is 4. But in the sample explanation, node 1's contribution was 3 pairs. So where's the mistake?

Ah, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Because the pairs (u, v) where l is the lca are not all possible pairs between different subtrees, but in reality, the pairs are the sum over all pairs of child subtrees. So for node l, the number of pairs (u, v) where u is in one child subtree and v in another is sum_{i < j} s_i * s_j, where s_i is the size of the ith child subtree.

So for node 1 in the first sample, the children are 2 and 3. The sizes of their subtrees are 1 and 3. So the number of pairs is 1*3 = 3. So node 1's contribution is 3. Then node 3's contribution is 2 (the children are 4 and 5, each of size 1. So sum is 1*1=1. So total contribution from node 3 is 1. So total is 3+1=4, which matches the sample.

So the correct approach is not to split the entire s-1 nodes into two groups, but instead, for each node l, the number of pairs (u, v) where l is the lca is equal to sum_{i < j} s_i * s_j, where s_i are the sizes of the immediate children's subtrees. Then, the maximum contribution for l is this sum. Because for each such pair (u, v), the permutation can be arranged such that a_l is between a_u and a_v. How?

Because the permutation can assign a_l to a value that is between the maximum of the left group and the minimum of the right group. So for each pair (u, v) from different children, if a_l is placed between them, then the condition holds. But the problem is how to arrange all pairs in such a way. It's possible that for all pairs in the sum, their u and v can be arranged such that a_l is between their values.

Wait, but how? For example, for node l with two children, each with s_i and s_j nodes. The sum is s_i * s_j. How can all these pairs be arranged such that a_l is between a_u and a_v for each pair (u, v). 

Perhaps by assigning a_l as a value such that all u in the first child's subtree are less than a_l, and all v in the second child's subtree are greater than a_l. Then, for all pairs (u, v) from the two children, a_u < a_l < a_v, which counts as a contribution. So the sum is s_i * s_j. So the maximum contribution for node l is s_i * s_j if there are two children, but if there are multiple children, the sum over all pairs of children's subtree sizes.

Wait, but if a node l has three children with sizes a, b, c. Then the number of pairs is a*b + a*c + b*c. So the maximum contribution for node l is this sum. Because for each pair of children, their subtree pairs contribute to the sum. So if all the nodes in the first child are assigned values less than a_l, the second child's nodes are assigned values less than a_l, and the third child's nodes are assigned values greater than a_l, then for the pairs between first and third, or second and third, the condition a_l is between them. But how to maximize the sum.

Alternatively, the maximum possible contribution for node l is exactly the sum of the products of the sizes of each pair of children's subtrees. Because when you arrange a_l to be the highest value in the subtree, then all nodes in the children's subtrees will have a value less than a_l, and thus, pairs from different children would have a_u < a_l and a_v < a_l, which does not satisfy the condition a_l between them. Wait, that's a problem. 

Wait, so in this case, if all children's nodes are less than a_l, then for any pair (u, v) from different children, their values would both be less than a_l, so a_l is not between them. So the condition a_u < a_l < a_v would not be satisfied. So the contribution would be zero.

Hmm, this suggests that the way of arranging the permutation is crucial. So perhaps the maximum contribution for node l is the sum of s_i * s_j, but only if the permutation is arranged such that for each pair of children i and j, exactly one of the groups (i's subtree) has values less than a_l and the other has values greater than a_l.

But how to arrange that. For example, for a node l with three children, the maximum possible contribution would require that for every pair of children, one is in the lower group and the other in the upper group. But that's not possible with three children. So perhaps the maximum contribution is not the sum of s_i * s_j, but rather the product of two groups when all the children's subtrees are partitioned into two groups as large as possible.

Wait, this brings us back to the initial approach. For node l, the maximum contribution is the maximum possible product of the sizes of two groups of children's subtrees, such that one group is considered left (values less than a_l) and the other group is right (values greater than a_l). For example, if l has three children with subtree sizes 3,4,5, then grouping 3+4=7 and 5=5 gives product 35. Alternatively, grouping 3+5=8 and 4=4 gives 32. Or 4+5=9 and 3=3 gives 27. So the maximum is 35.

So for each node l, the maximum contribution is the maximum possible product of the sum of some subset of children's subtree sizes and the sum of the complementary subset. The maximum product is achieved by splitting the children's subtrees into two groups such that their sums are as balanced as possible.

Ah! So this is a crucial point. For node l, when arranging the permutation, we can choose to split the children's subtrees into two groups. The left group (all subtrees in this group have nodes with values less than a_l) and the right group (all subtrees in this group have nodes with values greater than a_l). Then, the contribution for node l is the product of the total number of nodes in the left group and the right group. The maximum possible product for each node l is thus the maximum over all possible partitions of the children's subtrees into two groups, such that the product of the left sum and right sum is maximized.

This makes sense. For example, in the first sample, node 1 has two children with sizes 1 and 3. So the maximum product is 1*3=3. So the contribution is 3. For node 3, which has two children of size 1 and 1, the product is 1*1=1. So total is 3+1=4, which matches the sample.

So the approach is to compute for each node l the maximum possible product of two groups formed by splitting the children's subtrees into two non-empty groups, and summing the sizes of each group. For a node l with k children, we need to find the maximum product of the form (sum of some subset of children's sizes) * (sum of the complementary subset). The maximum of this product over all possible subsets is the contribution of node l. 

This is similar to the problem of splitting an array into two subsets such that the product of their sums is maximized. The optimal way to do this is to split the array into two subsets as balanced as possible.

So for each node, we need to compute the sum of the sizes of all its children's subtrees (sum_children) and then find the maximum possible product of a and b, where a + b = sum_children, and a and b are as balanced as possible. The maximum product is floor(sum_children/2) * ceil(sum_children/2).

Wait, yes. Because for a given sum s, the maximum product of two integers a and b where a + b = s is floor(s/2) * ceil(s/2). For example, if s=4, then 2*2=4. If s=5, then 2*3=6. So this is the case.

But why is this the case here? Because the sum_children is the sum of all children's subtree sizes. For node l, the sum_children is the total number of nodes in the subtrees of all its children, i.e., all descendants except l. Because the sum of the children's subtree sizes (each child's subtree includes the child and all its descendants). So for example, if node l has two children with subtree sizes s1 and s2, then sum_children = s1 + s2. But s1 and s2 include their own nodes, so the total number of nodes in l's subtree (excluding l itself) is sum_children. So sum_children = s-1, where s is the size of l's subtree (since l's subtree size is 1 (itself) plus sum_children).

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The size of the subtree rooted at l is 1 (for l) plus the sum of the sizes of each child's subtree. So if l has children c1, c2, ..., ck with subtree sizes s1, s2, ..., sk, then the size of l's subtree is 1 + sum(s1 + s2 + ... + sk). Therefore, sum_children = sum(s1 + s2 + ... + sk) = (size of l's subtree) - 1. 

So sum_children = s-1, where s is the size of l's subtree.

Thus, the maximum product for node l is floor(sum_children/2) * ceil(sum_children/2) = floor((s-1)/2) * ceil((s-1)/2).

But this is exactly the initial approach I considered, which didn't match the first sample. So why does it work in that case?

Wait, in the first sample, node 1's sum_children is 1 (child 2's subtree size) + 3 (child 3's subtree size) = 4. So s-1 =4. The product is 2*2=4. But according to the sample, node 1's contribution is 3. So this is conflicting.

So what's wrong here?

Ah, no. Because the sum_children is the sum of the children's subtree sizes. But the children's subtree sizes include the children themselves. So for node 1, the sum_children is 1 (subtree of 2) +3 (subtree of 3) =4. But node 1's subtree size is 1+4=5. So s=5, sum_children=4. The product is 2*2=4. But according to the sample, node 1's contribution is 3. So there's a contradiction here. So why?

Because the initial approach is incorrect. Because the maximum product for node l is not floor((sum_children)/2) * ceil((sum_children)/2), but the sum of s_i * s_j for all pairs of children. Wait, but in the first sample, sum_children is 4, and sum of pairs s_i * s_j for children 1 and 3 is 1*3=3. Which matches the sample's contribution for node 1.

So this suggests that the correct approach is that for each node l, the contribution is the sum of s_i * s_j for all pairs of children i < j. And this sum can be computed as (sum s_i)^2 - sum s_i^2 all divided by 2. Because (sum s_i)^2 = sum s_i^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} s_i s_j.

But in the first sample, sum s_i =1+3=4. Sum s_i^2 =1+9=10. So (4^2 -10)/2 = (16-10)/2=3. Which matches the sample's contribution.

So this is the correct approach. For each node l, the contribution is the sum over all pairs of children's subtree sizes. That is, for each pair of children of l, the product of their subtree sizes. Summing over all such pairs gives the contribution of l to the total f(a).

But how does this relate to arranging the permutation a? How can this sum be achieved.

Ah, here's the reasoning: For node l, if you can split its children into two groups such that all the subtrees in one group are assigned values less than a_l, and the other group's subtrees are assigned values higher than a_l, then all pairs of nodes u and v from different groups will contribute 1 to the count. Because their lca is l, and a_l is between them. The number of such pairs is the product of the total sizes of the two groups. But the maximum possible product is when the groups are as balanced as possible.

Wait, but the sum of s_i * s_j for all pairs is the total number of pairs of children's subtrees. For example, if a node has three children with sizes a, b, c. Then the sum is ab + ac + bc. If you split them into two groups, say {a} and {b, c}, then the product is a*(b +c) = ab + ac. Which is less than ab + ac + bc. So in this case, the sum of all pairs is the maximum possible, but splitting into groups would not capture all pairs.

Ah! So perhaps the maximum contribution for node l is not the sum of all pairs of children's subtree sizes. But how?

Wait, let's think again. For each pair (u, v) where l is their lca, u and v must be in different child subtrees of l. So the number of such pairs is the sum over all pairs of children's subtree sizes. For example, if node l has children c1, c2, c3 with subtree sizes s1, s2, s3, then the number of pairs is s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3.

Each such pair (u, v) can contribute 1 to f(a) if a_l is between a_u and a_v. The maximum possible contribution is when for each pair (u, v), a_l is between them. How can this be achieved?

If we assign a_l to be a value that is higher than all nodes in some of the children's subtrees and lower than the others. For example, if we split the children into two groups: group A and group B. All nodes in group A's subtrees are assigned values less than a_l, and group B's are assigned higher. Then, every pair (u in group A's subtree, v in group B's subtree) will contribute 1 to the count. The number of such pairs is (sum of group A's subtree sizes) * (sum of group B's subtree sizes). The maximum possible is achieved when group A and B are as balanced as possible.

So the maximum contribution for node l is the maximum possible value of (sum_A) * (sum_B), where sum_A is the sum of some subset of the children's subtree sizes, and sum_B is the sum of the complementary subset. This is equivalent to splitting the sum of all children's subtree sizes (sum_children = sum_A + sum_B) into two groups to maximize the product sum_A * sum_B. The maximum product is floor(sum_children/2) * ceil(sum_children/2).

But in the first sample, sum_children for node 1 is 4 (1+3), which would give 2*2=4. But according to the sample, the contribution is 3. So this contradicts.

Wait, but the sample's contribution is 3. So according to this approach, the contribution would be 4, but sample says 3. So this suggests that the approach is wrong.

But why is the sample's contribution 3. Because in the first sample, node 1's pairs are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So three pairs, each from different children. So why is the sum_children=4 (1+3) leading to a product of 2*2=4, but in reality there are only 3 pairs.

Ah, here's the mistake. The sum_children is 4, but the children are 2 and 3. The sum_children for node 1 is 1 (size of subtree 2) +3 (size of subtree3) =4. But the pairs between the two children are 1*3=3. So the maximum product is 3. But according to the approach of splitting into two groups sum_children=4, the product is 2*2=4. But this is impossible because the two groups are the two children's subtree sizes (1 and3). The maximum possible product is 1*3=3. So how does this fit?

Ah, because the approach of splitting sum_children into two groups as balanced as possible is not applicable here. Because the children's subtrees cannot be split further. Because the children are individual subtrees. For example, in node 1's case, the children are 2 and 3. Their subtree sizes are 1 and3. So the possible splits are to take 2's subtree (size 1) in group A, and 3's subtree (size3) in group B. Then the product is 1*3=3. Or any other split (but there are no other splits, since these are the only children). So the maximum product is 3, which is the sum of s_i*s_j for pairs of children. Which is the actual contribution.

So the correct approach is that for each node l, the contribution is the sum of s_i * s_j for all pairs of children i < j of l. Because in the optimal permutation, we can arrange a_l to be between the two groups of children's subtrees, which can be split into any two groups. But for this, we need to choose the split that maximizes the product of the sums of the two groups. 

But how does this split work? For example, if a node l has three children with sizes 1, 2, 3. sum_children=6. The maximum product is 3*3=9. But the sum of all pairs of children's sizes is (1*2) + (1*3) + (2*3) = 2+3+6=11. So if we can split the children's subtrees into groups such that sum_A=3 and sum_B=3, then the product is 9, which is higher than 11. So this suggests that the correct approach is not to take the sum of all pairs of children's sizes, but rather to find the maximum possible product between any possible split of the children's subtrees into two groups.

So the correct contribution for node l is the maximum possible product of sum_A * sum_B, where sum_A is the sum of a subset of the children's subtree sizes, and sum_B is the sum of the complementary subset.

This would require for each node l to compute the maximum possible product of sum_A * sum_B over all possible partitions of its children's subtrees into two groups. For example, in the first sample, the maximum product is 1*3=3. In the case of three children with sizes 1,2,3, the maximum product is (1+2)*3=9, which is larger than the sum of all pairs (11).

But according to the sample, the maximum contribution for node l is the sum of all pairs of children's sizes. So in this case, there is a discrepancy.

This suggests that the correct approach is to compute for each node l the sum of all pairs of children's subtree sizes. Because that's the actual number of pairs (u, v) where l is their lca, and the maximum possible contribution is that sum. But how to arrange the permutation such that for all those pairs, a_l is between a_u and a_v.

Ah, here's the crux. For each pair (u, v) where l is their lca, a_l must be between a_u and a_v. To maximize the count, we need to arrange a_l such that for as many pairs as possible, this condition holds. The optimal way is to arrange the permutation such that for each such pair (u, v), exactly one of a_u < a_l < a_v or a_v < a_l < a_u holds. 

For a node l, if we can split its children's subtrees into two groups, Left and Right, and assign all nodes in Left to have values less than a_l, and all nodes in Right to have values greater than a_l. Then, every pair (u in Left, v in Right) will contribute 1. The number of such pairs is sum_Left * sum_Right. To maximize this, we need to split the children's subtrees into two groups such that sum_Left * sum_Right is maximized.

So for node l, the maximum contribution is the maximum possible sum_Left * sum_Right over all possible subsets of children's subtrees. This is the same as finding the maximum product of two numbers that sum to sum_children. The maximum product is achieved when the two numbers are as close as possible. So sum_Left = floor(sum_children/2), sum_Right = ceil(sum_children/2). Thus, the contribution is floor(sum_children/2) * ceil(sum_children/2).

But this would be the maximum possible for any split of the children's subtrees. For example, in the first sample, sum_children is 4. The maximum product is 2*2=4. But according to the sample, the contribution is 3. Which is lower than this. So this approach is not correct.

Ah, now I'm really confused. So why is there a discrepancy?

Let me re-examine the first sample. The node 1 has two children, 2 and 3. Their subtree sizes are 1 and 3. So sum_children=4. The maximum possible product is 2*2=4. But according to the sample, the contribution is 3. So how can this be?

Because the children's subtrees cannot be split into smaller groups. For example, the children are 2 and 3. Each is a subtree. So we can choose to split the children into two groups: group A (child 2) and group B (child3), which gives product 1*3=3. Or group A (child3) and group B (child2), same product. Or can we split child3's subtree into smaller parts? No, because the children's subtree sizes are fixed. So the maximum possible product is 3. But according to the approach, it's 4. So the approach is incorrect.

So the mistake is that the approach assumes that the children's subtresses can be split into any subset, but in reality, each child's subtree is a single unit. So you can't split a child's subtree into smaller parts. You can only choose to assign a child's entire subtree to group A or group B.

So, for example, if a node has children c1, c2, c3 with subtree sizes s1, s2, s3, then the possible splits are any subset of the children. For each subset, sum_A is the sum of the s_i for the children in the subset, and sum_B is sum_children - sum_A. The maximum product is the maximum of sum_A * sum_B over all possible subsets.

This is a classic problem known as the partition problem: given a set of integers, partition them into two subsets such that the product of their sums is maximized. The optimal solution is to split the set into two subsets as balanced as possible. However, this is only possible if the numbers are allowed to be split into any subsets. But in our case, the numbers are the sizes of the children's subtrees, and the split is into any subset of the children.

So, the correct approach is for each node l, compute the maximum possible sum_A * sum_B, where sum_A is the sum of a subset of the children's subtree sizes, and sum_B is the sum of the remaining children's subtree sizes. The maximum over all possible subsets is the contribution of node l to the total.

This is a dynamic programming problem. For each node l, given the list of children's subtree sizes, compute the maximum possible sum_A * sum_B.

The way to compute this is:

sum_children = sum of all children's subtree sizes.

We want to find a subset of the children's subtree sizes whose sum is as close to sum_children / 2 as possible. The maximum product will be when sum_A is as close to sum_children / 2 as possible.

For example, in the first sample, sum_children=4. The possible subsets are:

- take child2's subtree (sum_A=1, sum_B=3). product=3.

- take child3's subtree (sum_A=3, sum_B=1). product=3.

- take none (sum_A=0, sum_B=4) product=0.

- take both (sum_A=4, sum_B=0) product=0.

So maximum is 3. Which matches the sample.

But if the children's subtree sizes are, say, 2 and 2, sum_children=4. Then the maximum product is 2*2=4.

So in this case, the approach is correct.

Thus, the correct way to compute the contribution of node l is to find the maximum possible sum_A * sum_B where sum_A is the sum of a subset of the children's subtree sizes, and sum_B = sum_children - sum_A.

So, for each node l, we need to compute this maximum product. How can we compute this efficiently, given that the sum_children can be up to 5000 (since n is up to 5000, and each node's subtree size can be up to 5000).

The standard way to solve this is using a dynamic programming approach to find the closest possible sum to sum_children / 2.

For each node l, the children's subtree sizes are s1, s2, ..., sk. sum_children = S = sum(s_i).

We need to find a subset of the s_i's that sums to a value as close as possible to S/2. The maximum product is then (S - a) * a, where a is the closest possible to S/2.

So, for each node l, we can model this as a knapsack problem where we try to find the maximum subset sum possible <= S/2.

The time complexity for each node is O(k * S), where k is the number of children and S is the sum_children for that node.

Since n is up to 5000, and for each node, the sum_children can be up to n-1 (for the root node), but the sum of all sum_children across all nodes is O(n), because each node's subtree size is counted once for each of its ancestors.

Wait, but for each node l, the sum_children is the sum of its children's subtree sizes. Each subtree size s_i is part of sum_children for l's parent. So the total sum of sum_children across all nodes is O(n^2), which for n=5e3 is 25e6, which might be manageable.

But the problem is that for each node, the DP for the knapsack problem could be O(k * S), where k is the number of children and S is the sum_children. For example, if a node has sum_children of 5e3 and 5e3 children (but that's impossible, since the tree has n nodes). The worst case is a star-shaped tree with the root having 5e3-1 children, each of size 1. Then sum_children is 5e3-1, and for the root's contribution, the maximum product is (2500) * (2500-1) ~ 6 million. But the DP would be O(5e3 * 5e3) = 25e6 operations, which is manageable for n=5e3.

But for multiple nodes, this might add up. For example, if each node has two children, then sum_children for each node would be s1 + s2. For each such node, the knapsack has two items. The maximum sum a is s1 if s1 <= s2, or s2 otherwise. So this is manageable.

So the approach is:

1. Compute the subtree sizes for each node.

2. For each node, compute the sum_children = sum of children's subtree sizes.

3. For each node, compute the maximum possible sum_A <= sum_children / 2, which is the maximum subset sum of the children's subtree sizes. The maximum product is sum_A * (sum_children - sum_A).

4. Sum this value for all nodes to get the total maximum f(a).

So the crux is to compute for each node l, given the children's subtree sizes, the maximum sum_A possible.

Now, how to compute this efficiently.

For each node l, the children's subtree sizes are s1, s2, ..., sk.

We need to find a subset of these s_i's that sums to the largest possible value <= S/2, where S is the sum of s_i's.

This is a classic knapsack problem. We can model this as follows:

- Initialize a boolean array dp where dp[j] indicates whether a sum of j is possible.

- Initialize dp[0] = True.

- For each s in s_i's:

   - For j from current_max down to s:

      - If dp[j - s] is True, set dp[j] to True.

- After processing all s_i's, find the maximum j <= S/2 where dp[j] is True.

The maximum j is the sum_A, and the product is j*(S-j).

The time complexity for each node is O(k * S), where k is the number of children and S is sum_children.

But for n=5e3, and sum_children up to 5e3, the total time could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which for n=5e3 is 25e6 operations. Which is acceptable for Python within 2 seconds.

So the steps are:

1. Build the tree from the input.

2. Compute the size of each subtree.

3. For each node, collect the sizes of its children.

4. For each node, compute S = sum of children's sizes.

5. For each node, compute the maximum sum_A <= S/2 using knapsack DP.

6. Add sum_A*(S - sum_A) to the total.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

First sample input:

5

1 1 3 3

The tree is:

1 is root.

1's children are 2 and 3.

3's children are 4 and 5.

Subtree sizes:

node 1: 5

node 2: 1

node 3: 3 (itself, 4,5)

node4:1

node5:1

For node 1's children: s1=1, s2=3. sum_children=4. S=4. S/2=2.

Possible subsets:

sum_A=1, product=1*3=3.

sum_A=3, product=3*1=3.

sum_A=0, product 0.

sum_A=4, product 0.

max is 3.

Contribution for node1:3.

node3's children:4 and5, each size 1. sum_children=2.

sum_children=2. S/2=1.

sum_A=1. product=1*1=1.

Contribution for node3:1.

Other nodes (2,4,5) have no children. Their contribution is 0.

Total sum:3+1=4. Which matches the sample.

Second sample:

2

1

Tree is 1-2.

node1's children:2. sum_children=1. S=1. sum_A can be 0 or 1. product is 0*1=0 or 1*0=0. So contribution is 0. Total is 0. Which matches the sample.

Third sample:

6

1 2 2 1 5

I need to build the tree. The parent array is [1,2,2,1,5] for nodes 2-6.

node2's parent is1.

node3's parent is2.

node4's parent is2.

node5's parent is1.

node6's parent is5.

So the tree is:

1

├── 2

│   ├── 3

│   └── 4

├── 5

    └──6

Subtree sizes:

node6:1.

node5:2 (5 and6).

node3:1.

node4:1.

node2:3 (2,3,4).

node1: 1+3+2=6.

Children of node1: 2,5. Their sizes are3 and 2. sum_children=5.

S=5. S/2=2.5. So maximum sum_A is 3 (if possible?), but possible subsets are:

subset {2}, sum=3. sum_B=2. product=3*2=6.

subset {5}, sum=2. sum_B=3. product=2*3=6.

So contribution is6.

node2's children are3 and4. sum_children=2. maximum product is 1*1=1.

node5's child is6. sum_children=1. maximum product is0.

node1's contribution is6. node2's is1. node5's is0. others are 0.

Total sum:6+1=7. Which matches the third sample's output.

Fourth sample:

4

1 1 1.

Tree is:

1 is root.

nodes2,3,4 have parent 1.

Subtree sizes:

node1:4.

children's sizes are 1,1,1. sum_children=3.

S=3. sum_children/2=1.5. The maximum sum_A is 2 (sum of two 1's), sum_B=1. product is 2*1=2.

Contribution for node1 is2.

Other nodes have no children. Total sum is2, which matches the sample.

So the approach works for the samples.

Now, to implement this.

Steps:

1. Read the input, build the tree as an adjacency list with parent pointers.

2. Compute the subtree sizes for each node. This can be done via post-order traversal.

3. For each node, collect the list of children's subtree sizes.

4. For each node, compute sum_children and solve the knapsack problem to find the maximum sum_A <= sum_children / 2.

5. Sum the contributions.

Now, for the code.

First, building the tree. Since the input gives p_i for i from 2 to n, which is the parent of i. So each node's parent is p_i. We can build a children array, where children[u] is a list of all children of u.

Then, compute the subtree sizes.

We can perform a post-order traversal. For each node, the size is 1 plus the sum of the sizes of all children.

Once we have the subtree sizes, for each node, collect the list of children's sizes.

Then, for each node, compute the sum_children = sum(children's sizes). If sum_children is 0, then contribution is 0.

Otherwise, compute the maximum subset sum <= sum_children // 2.

Now, the knapsack DP.

For each node, we can initialize a dp array of size (sum_children//2 +1), or use a set-based approach.

But for Python, using a bitmask or a list of booleans for the dp.

But sum_children can be up to 5000-1=4999 for the root node.

So for each node, we can create a dp array of size up to 5000.

Implementation steps:

For each node:

children_sizes = list of the sizes of its children.

sum_children = sum(children_sizes)

if sum_children ==0:

   contribution +=0

else:

   target = sum_children //2

   dp = [False]*(target+1)

   dp[0] = True

   max_reachable =0

   for s in children_sizes:

       for j in range(target, s-1, -1):

           if dp[j -s]:

               if j > max_reachable:

                   max_reachable =j

               dp[j] = True

   max_A = max_reachable

   contribution += max_A * (sum_children - max_A)

So for each node, we initialize the dp array to track possible sums.

We iterate over each child's size, and for each, we update the dp array backwards to avoid overwriting.

Finally, the maximum_A is the largest possible sum <= sum_children //2.

The product is max_A * (sum_children - max_A).

Now, let's test this code on the first sample.

Sample1: sum_children=4. target=2.

children_sizes = [1,3]

Processing 1:

for j from 2 downto 1:

j=2: j-1=1. dp[1] is not set yet.

j=1: dp[0] is True. So set dp[1] to True. max_reachable is 1.

Processing 3:

for j from 2 downto 3? No. s=3 is larger than target=2, so no change.

max_reachable remains 1.

max_A=1. product 1*(4-1)=3.

Which is correct.

So the code works.

Another test case: node has children sizes 2 and 2. sum_children=4. target=2.

Processing 2:

j=2: j-2=0, which is True. set dp[2]=True. max_reachable=2.

Processing next 2:

j=2: j-2=0, which is True. set dp[2] again (no change).

max_reachable=2.

product 2*2=4.

Yes.

Now, code in Python.

But for efficiency, since n can be up to 5000, and sum_children up to 5000, we need to process this efficiently.

In Python, using a set to track possible sums might be more efficient, but for small sum_children, using a list is acceptable.

So, the code steps:

Read n.

Read parents for nodes 2..n.

Build the children list.

Compute subtree sizes.

For each node, collect children_sizes.

Compute sum_children.

For each sum_children, run the knapsack DP to find the maximum sum_A.

Sum all contributions.

Now, code.

Let's write the code.

First, read the input.

n = int(input())

parents = list(map(int, input().split()))

children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)] # 1-based

for i in range(2, n+1):

    p = parents[i-2]

    children[p].append(i)

Then, compute subtree sizes.

subtree_size = [1]*(n+1)

post_order = []

stack = [(1, False)]

while stack:

    node, visited = stack.pop()

    if visited:

        for child in children[node]:

            subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]

        post_order.append(node)

    else:

        stack.append( (node, True) )

        for child in reversed(children[node]):

            stack.append( (child, False) )

But this is a post-order traversal. Alternatively, can use recursive approach, but for large n, stack is better.

Once subtree_size is computed.

Then, for each node, collect the children_sizes.

total =0

for node in range(1, n+1):

    children_sizes = [subtree_size[child] for child in children[node]]

    sum_children = sum(children_sizes)

    if sum_children ==0:

        continue

    target = sum_children //2

    dp = [False]*(target+1)

    dp[0] = True

    max_reachable =0

    for s in children_sizes:

        for j in range(target, s-1, -1):

            if dp[j -s] and not dp[j]:

                dp[j] = True

                if j > max_reachable:

                    max_reachable = j

    contribution = max_reachable * (sum_children - max_reachable)

    total += contribution

print(total)

This should work.
