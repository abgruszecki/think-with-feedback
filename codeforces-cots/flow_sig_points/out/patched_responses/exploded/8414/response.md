Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is, for each k-substring of a given string s, find the maximum length of an odd proper suprefix. Hmm, right. Let's break down the problem.

First, understanding the k-substrings. For a string of length n, the k-substring is s[k-1 : n+1 -k]. Because the problem says subsk is s_k s_{k+1} ... s_{n+1 -k}. So the length of each k-substring is (n+1 -k) - k +1 = n+1 -2k +1? Wait, wait. Wait, the substring from k to n+1 -k inclusive. So the length is (n+1 -k) - k +1 = n+1 -k -k +1 = n -2k +2. So the length is n-2k+2. For example, when k=1, the substring is from 1 to n, which is length n. Oh right, but the problem says there are exactly ceil(n/2) k-substrings. Let's see. For k from 1 to ceil(n/2). Let's check for n=15. Ceil(15/2) is 8. Which matches the first example's output of 8 numbers.

For each k-substring, we need to find the maximum odd proper suprefix. Let's clarify the terms. An odd proper suprefix is a string t such that:

1. |t| is odd.
2. t is both a prefix and a suffix of the k-substring (so a border, like the concept in KMP preprocessing).
3. The length of t is less than the length of the k-substring. So it's proper.

So for each k-substring T, we need to find the maximum possible length m (must be odd, and m < |T|) such that the first m characters and the last m characters of T are the same. Then, among all possible such m's, take the maximum. If none exists, output -1.

So the problem reduces to, for each substring T (each k-substring), find the largest odd m < len(T) where T[0..m-1] == T[len(T)-m..len(T)-1].

Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently for all possible k-substrings, given that n can be up to 1e6, which suggests that O(n) or O(n log n) algorithms are needed.

Let's think about how to approach this. For each possible T (each k), we can model this as a problem of finding the maximum border of odd length that is less than the length of T.

But doing this naively for each k would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Hmm, the key observation here is that for each possible substring T (the k-substring), we need to compute the largest odd border. So perhaps we can precompute for each possible position in the string some information that allows us to answer this quickly.

The KMP algorithm's failure function (also known as the prefix function) computes the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each position in the string. But the KMP failure function for a string T gives, for each index i in T, the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. So for the entire string T, the failure function's last value is the length of the longest border. But we need the largest odd border, and also to consider all possible borders (not just the longest) to find the maximum odd one.

Wait, but for each possible substring T, we can compute the failure function and then check for the maximum m that is odd and less than len(T), such that there exists a border of length m. But how to do that efficiently?

Alternatively, for each possible T (the k-substring), we can precompute the failure function for T and then, using the failure function array, find the maximum m that's odd and less than len(T). But again, computing the failure function for each T is O(len(T)) time, which for n/2 substrings would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.

So this approach is not suitable for large n. We need a way to compute the required information for all possible k-substrings in linear time.

Another thought: each k-substring is a substring of the original string s. For example, the k-substring for k=1 is s[0..n-1], for k=2 it's s[1..n-2], etc. So the k-substrings are centered around the middle of the original string. So maybe we can find a way to precompute for each possible center some information about possible borders.

Alternatively, think about the original string and precompute for all possible substrings. But that's not feasible either.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: for each possible k, the k-substring is a substring of s starting at index k-1 and ending at index n -k. Let's denote the start and end indices as l = k-1 and r = n -k. The length of the substring is r - l + 1 = (n -k) - (k-1) + 1 = n -2k +2. Wait, but for each k, l increases by 1, r decreases by 1. So the substrings are overlapping in a way that their lengths are decreasing by 2 as k increases by 1. Wait, no. For k=1, length is n. For k=2, length is n-2*2+2 = n-2+2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the substring for k is from position k-1 (assuming 0-based) to (n+1 -k -1), because the original description says s_k s_{k+1} ... s_{n+1 -k}, but the indices in the problem are 1-based. So for 0-based indices, the substring starts at (k-1) and ends at (n+1 -k -1) = (n -k). So length is (n -k) - (k-1) +1 = n -k -k +1 +1 = n -2k +2. So for k=1, length is n -2*1 +2 =n. For k=2, length is n-2*2 +2= n-2. For k=3, n-4, etc. So each k increases by 1, the length decreases by 2. So the k-substrings are of length n, n-2, n-4, ... until it's 1 or 2 (depending on parity of n). So the number of substrings is ceil(n/2).

So for each k from 1 to ceil(n/2), the substring is of length L = n - 2k +2. Wait, no. Wait, when k increases by 1, the length decreases by 2. So for example, when n is 15 (like the first example), ceil(15/2) is 8. The lengths for k=1 to 8 would be 15, 13, 11, 9, 7,5,3,1. Wait for k=8: L=15-2*8+2=15-16+2=1. Which matches the first example's 8th substring being 'c' (length 1). So yes.

So the problem is for each of these substrings of lengths L = n-2k+2, find the maximum m which is odd, m < L, and the prefix of length m equals the suffix of length m.

An alternative approach: for each possible substring T (each k-substring), the maximum possible m is the largest possible odd number less than L such that the first m characters equal the last m characters.

Now, let's consider that for a given T, the possible m's are the lengths of borders (proper) of T. So the maximum m is the largest odd border of T. So how do we find the largest odd border for T?

The KMP failure function for T gives the largest proper border. Let's call this value f. Then, if f is odd, then that's the maximum. If not, perhaps we need to look at the failure function of the prefix of length f, and see if it has an odd border. So we can iterate down the failure function chain until we find an odd length.

But this approach would take O(len(T)) time per T, which is O(n^2) overall, which is way too slow for n=1e6.

So we need a better way.

Alternative idea: Precompute for each possible position in the original string s, the maximum possible m for each possible substring.

Wait, but the substring varies. So perhaps not.

Another approach: For each possible center of the substring, precompute some information.

Alternatively, think of the problem as for each possible substring T (the k-substrings), precompute the maximum m (odd) such that T[0..m-1] = T[len(T)-m..len(T)-1]. We can model this as a problem of finding the longest prefix which is also a suffix, with length odd and less than len(T).

So the problem reduces to, for each T, compute the maximum m < len(T) which is odd, and m is a border of T. Then, if such m exists, output the maximum, else -1.

So the question becomes: how can we compute, for all possible substrings T (each being a k-substring of the original s), the maximum odd border.

Hmm. Let's think of the k-substrings as being the substrings of the form s[i..j], where i starts at 0 and j starts at n-1, and each subsequent k-substring is s[i+1..j-1], and so on until i >= j.

So for each such substring, we need to find the maximum odd border. Let's see if there's a way to compute this for all such substrings in linear time.

An alternative idea: For the entire string, precompute the prefix function array, which gives for each position the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. Then, for each possible k-substring, the maximum possible m would be derived from the prefix function of the substring.

But building the prefix function for each substring is O(n) per substring, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.

So, perhaps we need a way to compute, for all possible k-substrings, their maximum odd borders in linear time.

Wait, here's an observation: the k-substrings are symmetric in the original string. For example, the first k-substring is the entire string. The second is the string without the first and last characters, the third is the string without the first two and last two, etc. So the k-substrings are the central parts of the string.

So perhaps we can precompute for all possible centers (like in Manacher's algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring) some information that can help us compute the maximum odd borders.

Alternatively, think of the k-substrings as being the substrings that are centered in the original string. For example, the first k-substring is centered around the middle, and each subsequent one is moving towards the edges.

But how does this help?

Alternatively, for each possible substring T (k-substring), the maximum possible m is the largest odd number m < len(T) where T[0..m-1] == T[len(T)-m..len(T)-1]. So for each possible T, this m can be found by finding the largest m such that the prefix and suffix of length m match.

This is similar to the problem of finding the largest border of even or odd length, but here we specifically need odd.

Hmm. Let's think about the standard KMP approach. For the entire string, the prefix function array (failure function) allows us to find the maximum proper border. The failure function for the entire string (last element of the array) gives the length of the largest border. If that is odd, then that's the answer. If it's even, then we need to look for the next possible border. For example, the failure function for the border of length f is f', which is the largest border of the border. So perhaps, for each possible T, we can compute the maximum odd m by traversing the failure function chain.

But again, this approach would require processing each T individually, which is O(n^2) time.

So perhaps we need to precompute for each possible position the maximum odd borders for all possible substrings.

Alternatively, note that the k-substrings are nested and non-overlapping. Each subsequent k-substring is shorter by two characters. So for example, the first k-substring is the full string, the next is the string minus the first and last characters, etc. So the k-substrings are layers of the original string. So perhaps we can process these layers in order, and for each layer, compute the maximum odd border based on the previous computations.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's an idea: For each possible position in the original string, precompute for all possible lengths (specifically, odd lengths) the maximum possible m where the prefix and suffix of length m match. Then, for each k-substring, which has length L, we can check the maximum m for that substring's length.

But how?

Another thought: The maximum odd border of a string T is the largest odd number m < len(T) such that T starts and ends with the same m-length string. So for each possible m (odd, less than len(T)), check if the first m characters equal the last m. The largest such m is the answer.

But checking each m for each T is O(n^3) in the worst case, which is impossible.

Wait, but for each T, the possible m's are all odd numbers less than len(T). The maximum possible m is len(T) -1 if len(T) is even (since m has to be less than len(T)), but that's not necessarily the case.

So perhaps, for each possible substring T (each k-substring), we can compute the maximum m as follows:

- Check if the first and last characters are the same. If yes, then m=1 is possible.

But to find the maximum m, perhaps the largest m is determined by the longest possible prefix-suffix match of odd length.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer can be found using the KMP failure function. For the substring T, compute its failure function array. The last element of the array is the largest border. If that is odd, that's the answer. If not, we need to look at the failure function of that border's length, and so on until we find an odd length or reach zero.

So for example, let's say the largest border is f. If f is odd, then return f. If f is even, then look at the largest border of the prefix of length f, which is f'. If f' is odd, return f'. Else, continue until we find an odd value or zero. If none, return -1.

This approach for a single T would take O(L) time to compute the failure function array, and O(L) time in the worst case to check the chain. But for all k-substrings, this would be O(n^2) time, which is not acceptable for n=1e6.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. So we need a smarter way.

Let me think about the maximum possible m for each T. Since m must be odd, the maximum possible m is the largest possible odd number less than L (the length of T) that is a border.

Hmm. Wait, the maximum possible m could be found by considering the failure function for the entire T. Let's call this f. If f is odd, then m=f. If not, we look at the failure function of the prefix of length f, which is f', and so on. The first odd in this chain is the maximum possible m for T.

But again, how to compute this for all possible T in O(n) time.

Alternative idea: Precompute for the entire original string s the maximum possible odd borders for all possible substrings. But how?

Alternatively, note that the k-substrings are the substrings of the form s[i..j] where i and j start at 0 and n-1, and then i increases by 1 and j decreases by 1 each step.

So the first substring is [0, n-1], the next is [1, n-2], then [2, n-3], etc.

So each substring is a window moving inward. For each such window, the length is (j - i + 1) = n - 2(k-1) -1? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, for k=1, the length is n. For k=2, it's n-2. For k=3, n-4, etc. So the length L = n - 2(k-1) = n -2k + 2.

Wait, yes. For k=1, L = n -2*1 +2 =n. For k=2, L= n-2*2 +2= n-2. So each k, the length is n-2k +2.

So for each k, the substring is s[k-1 ... n -k], 0-based indices.

So the problem requires processing these substrings and for each, compute the maximum m.

Hmm.

Another approach: For each possible k, compute the maximum possible m by checking possible candidates. For example, check the largest possible m which is the maximum possible odd number less than L (the length of the substring) that could be a border.

But how to check that quickly.

Another idea: For each possible k, the substring T is of length L = n -2k +2. Let's consider that the maximum possible m must be the largest possible odd number less than L such that the first m characters of T equal the last m.

But how to compute this efficiently.

An alternative idea is to use hashing. For each possible m (odd), precompute the hash of the first m characters and the hash of the last m characters of the substring. If they match, then m is a candidate. The maximum such m is the answer.

But even with hashing, for each k, checking all possible m's up to L would take O(L) time per k, which is O(n^2) overall. Not feasible.

So, another idea is needed.

Wait, perhaps for each possible k, the answer is the largest odd m such that m is the largest possible that divides the failure function chain of the substring. But again, how to compute that.

Alternatively, for each possible substring T (the k-substring), the maximum m is the largest odd number in the set of all borders of T. So the answer is the maximum of such m.

The set of borders of T can be found by the chain of failure functions. For example, the borders are f, f', f'', etc., where each is the failure function of the previous. The maximum odd in this chain is the answer.

But again, how to compute this for all k-substrings in O(n) time.

Hmm. Let's think of the entire string and precompute for all possible positions the failure function. Then, for each k-substring, which is a substring starting at l =k-1 and ending at r= n -k, the length is L = r - l +1. So the substring is T = s[l..r].

We need to compute the failure function for T. But how to do that quickly.

Alternatively, the failure function for a substring can be computed incrementally. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the k-substrings are contiguous and each is formed by removing the first and last character of the previous, perhaps there's a way to update the failure function incrementally.

But I'm not sure. The failure function is dependent on the entire substring, so adding or removing characters at the ends would require recomputing most of the array.

Alternatively, the maximum possible m for T is the maximum odd border of T. So for each T, the maximum m is the maximum odd in the chain of failure functions for the entire T.

But how to find this for all T's efficiently.

Another idea: precompute for each possible position and possible length the failure function. But this is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Hmm. Let's think differently. For each possible starting index l and ending index r, we need to compute the maximum odd border for the substring s[l..r]. But this is O(n^2) possible substrings, which is way too much.

So perhaps the key is to find a way to process all k-substrings in linear time, leveraging the fact that they are consecutive and each is formed by trimming the ends.

Wait, the k-substrings are of the form [k-1, n-k], and k ranges from 1 to ceil(n/2). So each subsequent k-substring is obtained by moving the left index right by one and the right index left by one. So the k-substrings are the largest possible substring centered around the middle, then each step reduces the substring by two characters.

So the k-substrings form a sequence of nested substrings, each shorter by two characters than the previous. For example, for n=5, the k-substrings are:

k=1: 0..4 (length 5)
k=2: 1..3 (length 3)
k=3: 2..2 (length 1)

So the question is, can we compute for each of these nested substrings their maximum odd borders in O(1) or O(L) time for all of them, where L is the total sum of their lengths. For n=1e6, sum of lengths is 1e6 + (1e6-2) + (1e6-4) + ... which is O(n^2), but that's way too big. So we need a smarter approach.

Another observation: for each k-substring T, the maximum possible m is the largest odd number such that T has a border of length m. So perhaps we can precompute for each possible position in the original string the maximum odd border possible for substrings centered around that position.

Alternatively, think of each k-substring as being processed in the order of decreasing length. For example, the longest k-substring is first, then shorter ones. Maybe there's a way to reuse information from previous computations.

But how.

Alternatively, for the entire string, precompute for each possible possible odd length m the positions where the first m characters match the last m characters of the substring. But again, not sure.

Wait, here's another angle. For a substring T, the maximum m is the largest odd number m < L such that T's prefix of length m equals the suffix. Let's reverse the substring and see if the longest prefix that matches the suffix is m. So for T and its reverse, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled using hashing. For each possible substring T, compute the hash of the first m characters and the hash of the last m characters. If they are equal, then m is a candidate. For each T, the maximum m is the largest odd m less than len(T) for which this holds.

But even with precomputed prefix hashes and suffix hashes, checking for all m's would be O(1) per check. However, for each T, we need to check all possible m's (up to len(T)), which is O(L) per T, leading to O(n^2) time.

So that's not feasible.

Hmm. Let's think of the maximum possible m for each T. Since m must be odd and as large as possible, perhaps we can find for each possible T the largest m which is of the form 2p+1, where p is a non-negative integer, and m < L, such that the prefix and suffix of length m are equal.

So for each T, the maximum m is the maximum of all possible such 2p+1.

Let me think about the maximum possible m for T. For example, in the first sample input, the first k-substring (k=1) has length 15. The maximum m is 9. So 9 is less than 15, odd, and the first 9 characters equal the last 9.

So how do we find 9?

If we can find the largest m (odd) such that T[0..m-1] == T[L-m..L-1], then that's the answer.

Now, let's think of the problem as follows: for each possible substring T (each k-substring), find the largest odd m where m is the largest possible border.

The border must be a proper prefix/suffix, and have odd length.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each possible position in the original string the possible odd-length borders. For example, for each position i and j in the string, check if the substring s[i..j] has a prefix of length m (odd) equal to its suffix. But again, this is O(n^3), which is impossible.

Hmm. Let's think about the problem for a single T. Suppose T has length L. For each possible m (odd) from L-1 (if L is even) or L-2 (if L is odd) down to 1, check if the first m characters equal the last m. The first such m that satisfies this is the answer. But this approach is O(L) per T, leading to O(n^2) total time.

But for n=1e6, this is impossible.

So we need a way to compute this for all T's in linear time.

Alternative Idea: The k-substrings are nested. For example, T for k=1 is the entire string. T for k=2 is T1 without the first and last characters, etc. So for T_k, it's a substring of T_{k-1}.

So maybe the maximum m for T_k can be derived from the maximum m for T_{k-1}.

But how? For example, the maximum m for T_{k} could be the maximum m' = m_prev - 2 (if the characters added to the ends are the same), but this might not hold.

Alternatively, if T_{k} is a substring of T_{k-1} with two characters removed from each end, then the borders of T_{k} may have some relation to those of T_{k-1}.

But this is not obvious. For example, if T_{k-1} has a border of length m, then T_k would have a border of length m-2 if the first and last characters of T_{k} are the same as the corresponding parts in the previous border.

But this is speculative. Let's take an example.

Suppose T_{k-1} is 'abcba' (length 5). The maximum odd border is 3 (prefix 'ab' is not, but 'a' is. Wait, no: the entire string's failure function is the longest border. For 'abcba', the failure function for the entire string is 1 (since the first and last characters are 'a' and 'a'). So the maximum border is 1. Which is odd. So m=1. Then, T_{k} is 'bcb' (length 3). The failure function for this is 1 (since 'b' and 'b' are the first and last characters). So the maximum m is 1.

In this case, the m for T_{k} is 1, which is m_prev (1) minus 0.

But this is just one example. It's not clear how the maximum m for T_{k} relates to that of T_{k-1}.

So this approach may not be straightforward.

Another Idea: Since the k-substrings are symmetric (the first and last characters are removed each time), perhaps the maximum m for each T_k is related to the maximum m for T_{k-1} minus 2. But only if the new characters at the ends of T_{k} match.

For example, if the previous maximum m was m_prev, and the new T_k is the previous T with the first and last characters removed, then if the first and last characters of T_{k} are the same as the characters at positions 1 and m_prev-2 of T_{k-1}, then the new maximum m could be m_prev-2.

But this is a big if. Let's see:

Suppose T_{k-1} has a border of m_prev. So T_{k-1} starts with S and ends with S, where S is a string of length m_prev. Then T_k is T_{k-1} without the first and last characters. So T_k starts with S[1..m_prev-1], and ends with S[1..m_prev-1], but only if the second character of T_{k-1} is the same as the second-to-last character. So if that's the case, then the maximum m for T_k could be m_prev-2 (if it's odd and greater than zero).

But this is only possible if the new characters added to the substring (i.e., the first and last characters of T_k) match the required parts of the previous border.

So this might allow us to track the maximum m for each T_k by checking if the previous maximum can be adjusted by subtracting 2 and checking the new characters.

But how?

Let's consider the first example:

Sample Input 1:
15
bcabcabcabcabca

The first substring is the entire string, length 15. The maximum m is 9. Then the next substring is from index 1 to 13 (length 13). The maximum m is 7. Then 11 and 9, etc. So each time the maximum m decreases by 2. So perhaps for this case, each T_k's maximum m is the previous maximum minus 2.

But why does this happen? Because the new substring is the previous one with first and last characters removed. And if those characters were part of the previous border, then the new substring's border would be the previous border minus 2.

But this depends on the structure of the string.

So perhaps the maximum m for T_k can be computed as m_prev - 2, provided that the first and last characters of T_{k-1} are the same as those of T_k's first and last characters in the border.

But how to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps for each T_k, the maximum m is the maximum between the current possible candidates (m_prev - 2, m_prev -4, etc.) but this is unclear.

So here's an idea: For each k, we can keep track of the current maximum possible m. Initially, for k=1, compute the maximum m for the entire string. Then, for each subsequent k, subtract 2 from the previous maximum and check if the first and last (m_candidate) characters of the new substring match. If they do, then m_candidate is the new maximum. Otherwise, decrease by 2 and check again, until we find a valid m_candidate or reach 0.

But how to efficiently check if the first m_candidate characters of the new substring T_k equal the last m_candidate characters.

But even this approach could take O(1) time per k if the checks can be done quickly.

Wait, but how to check if the first m_candidate characters of T_k match the last m_candidate characters.

The new substring T_k is T_prev without the first and last characters. So the first m_candidate of T_k is the same as the characters 1 to m_candidate of T_prev. The last m_candidate of T_k is the characters (L_prev - m_candidate -1) to (L_prev - 2) of T_prev.

So for example, if T_prev is s[0..14] (length 15), then T_k is s[1..13] (length 13). If the previous m_prev was 9, then the candidate m for T_k is 7. So we need to check if s[1..7] == s[7..13] (since T_k's length is 13, the last 7 characters are s[7..13]).

But T_prev's first 9 characters are s[0..8], and the last 9 are s[6..14]. So for the new T_k's first 7 and last 7 to match, s[1..7] must equal s[7..13].

But how to quickly check if this is the case.

This seems like a problem that can be solved with a precomputed hash function. For example, precompute the prefix hashes and suffix hashes for the entire string. Then, for any substring and any m, we can compute the hash of the first m characters and the hash of the last m characters in O(1) time.

So, here's the plan:

1. Precompute prefix hashes and suffix hashes for the entire string s. Use a rolling hash (like polynomial rolling hash) to allow O(1) hash computation for any substring.

2. For each k-substring T, compute the maximum possible m (odd, less than len(T)) as follows:

   a. Start with the maximum possible m for T, which is len(T) if len(T) is even, or len(T) -1 if len(T) is odd. Then, step down by 2 each time until m >=1.

   b. For each candidate m, compute the hash of the first m characters of T and the hash of the last m characters of T. If they match, then this is the maximum m for T.

   c. If no such m is found, output -1.

But even with O(1) hash checks, for each T, in the worst case, we need to check O(L) m's, which is O(n) per T. For n=1e6, this is O(n^2) time.

So this approach is not feasible.

Another Idea: The maximum m for each T can be derived from the previous T's maximum m. For example, if the previous T had a maximum m of x, then the current T's maximum m could be x-2, provided that the new first and last characters of the current T's m are the same.

Wait, let's think about this:

For T_prev (k-1), the maximum m is m_prev. Then, T_k is T_prev with the first and last characters removed. So the new candidate m is m_prev - 2. But we need to check if the new T_k's first (m_prev-2) characters equal the last (m_prev-2) characters.

If yes, then the maximum m for T_k is m_prev-2. Otherwise, we need to check m_prev-4, and so on.

But this depends on the structure of the string. For example, in the first sample input, each T's maximum m is 2 less than the previous. So this approach would work. But what about cases where this isn't the case?

For example, consider a string like 'abacaba'. The first T (k=1) is 'abacaba' (length 7). The maximum m is 3 (prefix 'aba' and suffix 'aba'). Then, the next T is 'bacab' (length 5). The maximum m is 3 (prefix 'bac' and suffix 'cab' don't match, but perhaps there's a longer odd border. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, 'bacab' has length 5. Possible m's are 3 and 1.

Check m=3: first 3 chars 'bac' vs last 3 'cab' → no. So m=1: 'b' vs 'b' → yes. So maximum m is 1. So the next T's maximum m is 1. So the previous approach of m_prev-2 (3-2=1) gives the correct result. But only if the new m=1 is valid.

So perhaps the algorithm is:

Initialize for k=1 (the entire string) to find the maximum m using the standard KMP failure function approach.

Then, for each subsequent k:

- The candidate m is previous_max_m - 2.

- Check if this candidate m is odd, >=1, and less than the current T's length.

- Check if the first m characters of T_k equal the last m characters.

   - If yes, set current_max_m = m.

   - If no, subtract 2 and repeat.

- If no such m is found, current_max_m is -1.

But how to check the equality of the first m and last m characters of T_k quickly.

Here's where the rolling hash comes in. Precompute prefix and suffix hashes for the entire string, so that for any substring T and any m, the hash of the first m characters and the hash of the last m characters can be computed in O(1) time.

This way, each check for a candidate m can be done in O(1) time.

If the maximum m for each T is either the previous_max_m -2 or lower by steps of 2, then the number of checks per T is O(1) on average.

In the best case, for each T, we check only one candidate (m_prev -2), and it works. That would be O(1) per T, leading to O(n) overall time.

But in the worst case, each T may need to check O(m) candidates, but perhaps the total number of checks is O(n) across all T's.

This seems plausible. Let's think about how many steps we could have. For example, if the maximum m for each T is 1, then for each T after the first few, we check 1 once. So the total steps would be O(n).

Alternatively, for some T's, we might have to check multiple candidates. But the total number of checks across all T's is O(n) because each check reduces the candidate m by 2, and the sum of all possible m's across all T's is O(n).

So this approach could work.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute prefix and suffix rolling hashes for the entire string s.

2. For k=1, compute the maximum m using the KMP failure function approach for the entire string. This gives the initial previous_max_m.

3. For each subsequent k (from 2 to ceil(n/2)), do:

   a. Determine the current substring T_k's start and end indices: l =k-1, r= n -k.

   b. The length of T_k is L = r - l +1 = n - 2k +2.

   c. If L is 1, then output -1 (since m must be less than 1, which is impossible).

   d. Initialize current_max_m as previous_max_m -2.

   e. While current_max_m >=1 and (current_max_m >= L or current_max_m is even):

       i. current_max_m -=2.

   f. Now, check if current_max_m is >=1 and odd, and less than L.

   g. If yes, compute the hash of the first current_max_m characters of T_k and the hash of the last current_max_m characters. If they are equal, then this is the current_max_m.

   h. If not, keep subtracting 2 until we find a valid m or reach 0.

   i. If no valid m is found, set current_max_m to -1.

   j. Output current_max_m.

But how to compute the hash for the first current_max_m characters of T_k and the last current_max_m characters.

For example, T_k starts at l and ends at r. The first current_max_m characters are s[l ... l + current_max_m -1], and the last current_max_m characters are s[r - current_max_m +1 ... r].

Using the prefix hash array, we can compute the hash of any substring in O(1) time. Similarly for the suffix hash array.

So, precompute:

- A prefix hash array where prefix_hash[i] is the hash of s[0..i].

- A suffix hash array where suffix_hash[i] is the hash of s[i..n-1].

Then, for any substring s[a..b], the hash can be computed using the prefix_hash.

But I'm not sure. Wait, typically, rolling hash is computed as a polynomial accumulation, and the hash of s[a..b] can be computed using prefix_hash[b] - prefix_hash[a-1] * base^(b-a+1), modulo some large prime.

But the exact implementation depends on how the hash is computed.

Similarly, for the suffix hash, we could compute it as the hash from the end.

Alternatively, for each position i, compute the hash of the substring s[i..i + m -1] and the hash of the substring s[j -m +1..j], and compare them.

But this requires a way to compute the hash of any substring efficiently.

Assuming we precompute the prefix hashes and the powers of the base, then the hash of s[a..b] can be computed as (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * base^(b - a +1)) mod mod_value.

So the steps are:

1. Choose a base (like 911382629) and a mod_value (like 1e18 +3).

2. Precompute the prefix_hash array where prefix_hash[i] is the hash of the first i characters (s[0..i-1]).

3. Precompute the power array where power[i] is base^i mod mod_value.

4. To compute the hash of s[a..b], compute (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[b -a + 1]) mod mod_value.

Similarly, compute the hash for the suffix. Or, since the string is the same, the suffix hash can be computed using the same prefix_hash but reversed.

Alternatively, for the reverse string, precompute another prefix_hash_rev.

So for the last m characters of T_k (which is s[r -m +1 ... r]), their hash can be computed as the hash of the reversed substring. Or, perhaps, we can compute it using the original prefix_hash by adjusting the indices.

Alternatively, since the last m characters of T_k are the same as the substring ending at r and of length m, we can compute their hash using the prefix_hash array.

But perhaps it's easier to precompute two hash arrays: one for the forward direction and one for the reversed string.

For example:

Compute forward_hash for s, and reversed_hash for s[::-1]. Then, the hash of the first m characters of T_k is the hash of s[l ... l +m -1], computed from forward_hash. The hash of the last m characters of T_k is the hash of s[r -m +1 ... r], which can be computed as the hash of the reversed substring s[r ... r -m +1], which would be the first m characters of the reversed substring starting at r. So using the reversed_hash array.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, for the last m characters of T_k (s[r-m+1 ... r]), their hash can be computed using the forward_hash as follows:

hash_forward = (prefix_hash[r+1] - prefix_hash[r -m +1] * power[m]) mod mod_value.

Yes, because the hash of s[a..b] is computed as (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[b -a +1]) mod mod_value.

So for the substring s[r-m+1 ... r], the hash is:

hash = (prefix_hash[r+1] - prefix_hash[r -m +1] * power[m]) mod mod_value.

Similarly, the hash of the first m characters of T_k (s[l ... l +m-1]) is:

hash = (prefix_hash[l +m] - prefix_hash[l] * power[m]) mod mod_value.

So with these two calculations, we can compare the hash of the first m and the last m characters of T_k.

Thus, the plan is:

- Precompute prefix_hash and power arrays.

For each candidate m in the current T_k:

- Compute hash_first = hash of s[l ... l +m -1]

- Compute hash_last = hash of s[r -m +1 ... r]

If hash_first == hash_last, then m is valid.

Now, the question is whether this hash comparison is sufficient to ensure that the actual strings are equal. With a good choice of base and mod_value, the probability of collision is low, but for a programming contest, using a double hash (two different bases and mod_values) may be necessary to pass all test cases. However, given the time constraints, perhaps a single large mod_value would suffice.

But for the purpose of this problem, let's proceed with a single hash.

Now, the steps for the code:

1. Precompute the prefix_hash and power arrays.

2. For k=1, compute the maximum m using the KMP failure function approach.

3. For each subsequent k, compute the candidate m as previous_max_m -2, and check if it's valid (m is odd, less than L, and the hash of the first m and last m of T_k match). If not, subtract 2 and check again until m becomes 1 or less.

4. Output the maximum m found for each k.

Now, the first step is to compute the maximum m for the first k=1.

To compute this m, we can use the KMP failure function approach. For the entire string s, compute the failure function array. The failure function for the entire string (last element) gives the largest proper border. If this is odd, then m is this value. If not, we need to follow the failure function chain to find the largest odd border.

For example, for the failure function array, the last element is f. If f is odd, then m =f. Else, check the failure function at position f-1, which is the next largest border. Continue until we find an odd value or reach 0.

Thus, for the first k=1, we compute the failure function array, then find the maximum odd m.

But for n=1e6, this would take O(n) time and space. Which is acceptable.

Once the initial m is found, subsequent k's can be processed using the hash-based approach.

Now, the code outline:

- Precompute prefix_hash and power arrays.

- Compute the failure function for the entire string s to find the initial m for k=1.

- For k from 2 to ceil(n/2):

   a. Compute l =k-1, r= n-k.

   b. L = r -l +1.

   c. If L <1: output -1.

   d. current_max_m_candidate = previous_max_m -2.

   e. while current_max_m_candidate >=1 and (current_max_m_candidate >= L or current_max_m_candidate % 2 ==0):

       current_max_m_candidate -=2.

   f. Now, current_max_m_candidate is the highest possible m that is <= previous_max_m -2, odd, and <L.

   g. Now, check in steps of 2, starting from current_max_m_candidate down to 1:

      For each m in current_max_m_candidate, current_max_m_candidate-2, ...:

         if m <1: break.

         compute hash_first and hash_last for m in T_k.

         if they match:

             set current_max_m = m.

             break.

      if no such m found:

          current_max_m =-1.

   h. append current_max_m to the result.

   i. set previous_max_m = current_max_m.

But even this approach could be O(n^2) in the worst case. However, considering that each step's candidate starts from previous_max_m -2, which is based on the previous maximum, and the maximum m can only decrease, the total number of hash checks across all k's should be O(n), as each step's checks are O(1) on average.

For example, suppose each k requires at most one hash check (the initial candidate m_prev-2). If that's valid, then proceed. If not, subtract 2 until a valid m is found. But this could require O(L) steps for some k's, but perhaps the total steps across all k's is O(n).

In practice, this should be fast enough for n=1e6.

Now, the code implementation:

First, precompute the prefix_hash and power arrays.

Then, compute the failure function for the entire string.

Then, for each k, process as per the above steps.

But how to compute the failure function for the entire string.

Here's how the failure function (prefix function) is computed:

def compute_prefix_function(s):
    n = len(s)
    pi = [0] * n
    for i in 1..n-1:
        j = pi[i-1]
        while j >0 and s[i] != s[j]:
            j = pi[j-1]
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            j +=1
        pi[i] = j
    return pi

So for the entire string s, the failure function's last element is the length of the longest proper border. We then check if this is odd. If not, we follow the failure function chain until we find an odd length.

So for example:

pi = compute_prefix_function(s)

max_m = pi[-1]

while max_m >0:

    if max_m %2 ==1:

        break

    max_m = pi[max_m-1]

if max_m ==0 and len(s) %2 ==1 and len(s) >1:

    # check if the first character equals the last character

    if s[0] == s[-1]:

        max_m =1

else:

    max_m =-1 if max_m ==0 else max_m

Wait, but when the failure function is zero, we need to check if the first and last characters are equal. For example, if the entire string has no proper border except possibly of length 1.

Wait, but if the failure function's last element is zero, that means the longest proper border is zero. So the maximum m is zero. But we need to check if there's a border of length 1 (if possible).

So for the initial k=1, the steps are:

compute the prefix function for s.

max_m = pi[-1]

if max_m is odd and max_m < len(s):

    current_max = max_m

else:

    traverse the failure function chain of max_m to find the largest odd m.

So for example:

current_max = 0

m = pi[-1]

while m >0:

    if m %2 ==1 and m < len(s):

        current_max = m

        break

    m = pi[m-1]

if current_max ==0:

    # check if the first and last characters are the same (m=1)

    if len(s) >=2 and s[0] == s[-1]:

        current_max =1

    else:

        current_max =-1

But len(s) for k=1 is >=2, since the problem states n >=2.

So this would compute the initial current_max.

Now, for the code:

Implement the compute_prefix_function for the entire string.

Then, compute the initial current_max as described.

Once that's done, proceed to process the remaining k's.

Now, the code outline:

import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())

s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

mod = 10**18 + 3

base = 911382629

# Precompute prefix_hash and power array

power = [1] * (n+1)

for i in range(n):

    # returns hash of s[l..r] (0-based, inclusive)

    if l > r:

    return res

# Compute initial current_max for k=1

# Compute prefix function for s

pi = [0] * n

for i in range(1, n):

    j = pi[i-1]

    while j >0 and s[i] != s[j]:

        j = pi[j-1]

    if s[i] == s[j]:

        j +=1

    pi[i] = j

# find maximum odd border for s

current_max = 0

m = pi[-1]

while m >0:

    if m %2 ==1 and m < n:

        current_max = m

        break

    m = pi[m-1]

else:

    # check if m=1 is possible

    if s[0] == s[-1]:

        current_max =1

    else:

        current_max =-1

result = [current_max]

# Process k from 2 to ceil(n/2)

ceil_n_over_2 = (n +1) //2

for k in range(2, ceil_n_over_2 +1):

    l = k-1

    r = n -k

    L = r - l +1

    if L <=0:

        result.append(-1)

        continue

    if L <1:

        result.append(-1)

        continue

    previous_max = result[-1]

    # candidate_m starts at previous_max -2

    candidate_m = previous_max -2

    # adjust candidate_m to be odd, less than L, >=1

    while candidate_m >=1 and (candidate_m >= L or candidate_m %2 ==0):

        candidate_m -=2

    found = -1

    while candidate_m >=1:

        # compute hash of first candidate_m and last candidate_m of T_k

        # first: s[l..l + candidate_m -1]

        # last: s[r - candidate_m +1 ... r]

        if l + candidate_m -1 > r or r - candidate_m +1 < l:

            candidate_m -=2

            continue

        hash_first = get_hash(l, l + candidate_m -1)

        hash_last = get_hash(r - candidate_m +1, r)

        if hash_first == hash_last:

            found = candidate_m

            break

        candidate_m -=2

    # if no found, check m=1

    if found ==-1:

        # check if first and last character of T_k are the same

        if s[l] == s[r] and L >=2:

            found =1

    result.append(found if found !=0 else -1)

# convert result to strings, replace any found ==0 with -1

output = []

for x in result:

    if x <=0:

        output.append(-1)

    else:

        output.append(x)

print(' '.join(map(str, output)))

Wait, but there's a bug here. For the current_max in the first step, when the initial m computed from the failure function is not found, we need to check if m=1 is possible by comparing the first and last characters of the entire string.

In the code above, after the loop, if current_max is 0, and the first and last characters are equal, then current_max is set to 1. Otherwise, -1.

But in the code for processing k=1, the code seems to handle this.

But when k=2, the T_k is the substring s[1..n-2], etc.

Now, in the loop for k in range(2, ...):

For each k, we start by checking candidate_m = previous_max -2.

But this candidate_m could be even, so we adjust it by subtracting 2 until it's odd and less than L.

Then, for each candidate_m, we check if the first and last m characters of T_k match.

If not, subtract 2 and check again.

But in the worst case, this could take O(L) steps for each k.

But given that the candidate_m starts at previous_max -2, which is derived from the previous k's maximum, this could be efficient.

Now, let's test this code against the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

15

bcabcabcabcabca

The initial current_max for k=1 is 9.

For k=2, the substring is s[1..13] (length 13). The candidate_m is 9-2=7. Since 7 is odd and less than 13, we check if the first 7 characters and last 7 characters match.

The code computes hash_first and hash_last. If they match, then found=7.

Assuming that they do match, then the current_max for k=2 is 7.

This proceeds similarly for k=3, etc.

Which matches the sample output.

Thus, the code should work.

But there's a problem when the previous_max is -1. For example, when the previous k's current_max is -1, then candidate_m is -1 -2 = -3, which is invalid. So in this case, the code should check from the maximum possible m for the current T.

But when previous_max is -1 (meaning no valid m), the code will start with candidate_m = -3, which is invalid, so the loop will not find any m and check m=1. If the first and last characters of the current T match, then m=1 is the answer.

So the code has a bug in this case. For example, when previous_max is -1, the code may not check m=1.

For example, consider a k-substring where the previous_max is -1, but the current T has first and last characters equal. Then, the code should output 1.

But in the code, candidate_m starts at -3, then enters the loop:

candidate_m = previous_max -2 = -3.

The while loop 'while candidate_m >=1 and ...' is not entered.

Then, found is -1. Then, after the loop, check if s[l] == s[r]. If yes, found=1.

Thus, the code handles this case.

Thus, the code should correctly handle cases where previous_max is -1.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, considering the time constraints.

The prefix_hash and power arrays are precomputed in O(n) time.

The initial failure function is computed in O(n) time.

Then, for each k, the inner loop runs for O(1) steps on average, leading to O(n) total time.

Thus, the code should run in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e6.

Memory usage:

The prefix_hash and power arrays are O(n) each, which for n=1e6 is 2MB each (each entry is a 64-bit integer), totaling 4MB. The prefix function array is O(n) (1e6 integers), which is 4MB. So total memory is around 8MB, well under the 256MB limit.

Thus, the code should work.
