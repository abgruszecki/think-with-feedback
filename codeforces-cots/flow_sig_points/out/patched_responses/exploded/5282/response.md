<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of distinct correct bracket substrings in a given string. The constraints are tightâ€”n can be up to 500,000, so the solution must be O(n) or O(n log n) time. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for valid parentheses problems, a common approach is using a stack. Like, for each ')', we check if there's a matching '('. But how do we track all valid substrings and count the distinct ones?

Let me think. Each valid substring must be a balanced parentheses string. And since substrings are contiguous, we need to find all such balanced substrings without duplicates.

Wait, but even if two substrings are the same, like "()" appearing multiple times, we count them once. So the main challenge is to find all unique valid substrings.

So the problem reduces to finding all unique valid parentheses substrings in the given string and count them.

Hmm. How can we efficiently find all valid substrings and track the unique ones?

The straightforward approach would be to find all valid substrings using a stack-based method, then store them in a set to avoid duplicates. But with n up to 5e5, this approach would be O(n^2) in the worst case (like a string of all '()()()...', leading to O(n^2) valid substrings), which would be way too slow. So storing each substring in a set is not feasible.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to track unique valid substrings without explicitly storing all of them.

Alternative idea: each valid substring is a balanced parentheses string. To represent such a substring uniquely, perhaps we can find a way to encode it by its start and end positions, but how to avoid duplicates? For example, two different intervals in the string that form the same sequence would be considered the same and counted once.

Wait, but the problem requires distinct substrings. So even if two intervals have the same sequence, they are considered the same and counted once. So the key is to find all unique sequences that are valid.

So the approach must generate all possible valid sequences and count how many distinct ones there are.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each valid substring, compute a hash or some representation that allows us to track uniqueness. But even that might be expensive if the number of valid substrings is large.

Hmm. Let's think about the valid substrings. A valid substring must be a balanced parentheses string. The structure of such substrings can be determined by the stack approach.

In the standard stack approach for finding the longest valid parentheses substring, we use a stack to track indices of opening brackets. When a closing bracket is found, we pop the stack and calculate the length. But that's for the maximum length. How to adapt this to find all valid substrings?

Wait, when using the stack approach, for each closing bracket at index i, the matching opening bracket is at index popped from the stack. The substring from popped index + 1 to i is a valid one. But perhaps, during this process, we can track all such valid substrings.

But even then, how to track all possible valid substrings, especially those nested within others.

Wait, perhaps the valid substrings are those that are formed by consecutive matches. For example, when a closing bracket matches an opening one, that's a base case. Then, any valid substring can be built by combining adjacent valid substrings or nesting them.

But this seems vague. Let's think of an example. For the string "(()())", the valid substrings are the ones starting and ending at various positions. How to track all of them?

An alternative idea: each time we find a valid pair, like at positions (i, j), we can note that this forms a valid substring. But perhaps overlapping or nested pairs can form longer valid substrings. So the problem is similar to finding all possible valid pairs and their combinations.

But again, how to do this efficiently and track unique substrings.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem as first finding all possible valid substrings and then deduplicating them.

The main challenge is to efficiently represent the valid substrings so that duplicates are not counted.

One possible way is to compute a hash for each valid substring. Then, store all these hashes in a set, and the size of the set is the answer. However, computing the hash for every valid substring could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not feasible.

So this approach isn't efficient enough.

Alternative approach: find all valid substrings in O(n) time and then somehow compute the number of unique ones.

Wait, but how?

Let me think again about the structure of valid substrings. Each valid substring must be a balanced string. The balanced strings can be of different types. For example, "()", "(())", "()()", etc. Each of these can be represented by their structure.

But how can we represent their structure in a way that allows us to count unique ones efficiently?

Another idea: the valid substrings are balanced, so their structure can be represented by their length and certain other properties, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the string itself is needed to determine uniqueness. So the only way to track uniqueness is by the actual substring content.

But storing all possible substrings in a set would be O(n^2) in the worst case. For n=5e5, this is impossible.

Therefore, the problem requires a way to count the number of unique valid substrings without explicitly storing each of them.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard solution for counting distinct substrings in a string: suffix automaton. But even building a suffix automaton for the entire string and then checking each state whether it represents a valid balanced substring. However, building a suffix automaton is O(n) time, but how to check which states correspond to valid balanced substrings?

This seems promising but complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find all the valid substrings and then find how many unique ones there are by their start and end positions and the structure.

Wait, but how to avoid checking every possible valid substring. Let's think differently.

Suppose we can find for each position the valid substrings that end there, and track their content in a way that allows deduplication.

Wait, maybe when we process the string with a stack, for each closing bracket, we can track the start of the valid substring. For example, when a closing bracket at position i matches an opening bracket at position j, the substring s[j..i] is valid. Additionally, if there was a previous valid substring ending at j-1, then the combined substring could be valid.

But how to track all possible valid substrings, including those that are combinations of previous valid ones.

Wait, perhaps using dynamic programming. Let's consider an array dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at i. Then, if s[i] is ')', and the character at i - dp[i-1] -1 is '(', then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] -2] (if applicable). This is the standard approach for finding the length of the longest valid substring.

But how to use this to find all valid substrings and count unique ones.

Alternatively, for each valid substring [a, b], we can represent it as the substring s[a..b]. The problem is to count how many unique s[a..b] there are among all valid [a, b].

So the key is to collect all possible s[a..b] that are valid and count the distinct ones.

But the issue is that for large n, the number of valid substrings could be O(n^2), which is impossible to process directly.

Thus, the solution must find a way to represent the valid substrings in a way that allows us to count unique ones efficiently.

Another idea: note that a valid substring must be a balanced string. Therefore, the number of opening and closing brackets must be equal. Also, for any prefix of the substring, the number of opening brackets is at least the closing ones.

So, for each valid substring, these conditions must hold.

But how to use that to find the unique ones.

Perhaps, for each valid substring, its length must be even. So, we can process the string and for each possible even-length substring, check if it's valid and then add it to a set. But this is O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.

Alternative approach inspired by the stack-based method:

Use a stack to track the positions of the opening brackets. For each closing bracket, when we find a matching opening bracket, we can calculate the current valid substring. Then, check if the substring starting at the popped index + 1 (the start of the current valid substring) to current index is valid. Also, check if there are adjacent valid substrings to combine with, forming longer valid substrings.

But even that might not capture all possible valid substrings. Let's think:

The standard stack method for the longest valid substring uses the DP approach. Each time a closing bracket is found, if the previous character is a matching opening, then the current valid length is 2 plus the previous valid length. If there's a valid substring before that (i.e., i - dp[i-1] - 1 is a valid index and s[i - dp[i-1] -1] is '('), then we add the previous dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2] to the current dp[i].

But how to track all possible valid substrings.

Wait, perhaps each time a valid substring is found (like a pair (j, i)), then all possible valid substrings within that can be considered. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each time we find a valid pair, we can generate the substring from j to i, and also check if there are valid substrings ending at j-1. For example, if there's a valid substring ending at j-1, then combining it with the current one gives a longer valid substring.

But how to track all possible combinations.

Alternatively, for each closing bracket, when we find a matching opening bracket, the substring s[j..i] is valid. Then, any valid substring that ends at j-1 can be combined with this to form a longer valid substring.

But this seems similar to how the DP approach works for the longest valid substring.

But how to capture all possible valid substrings.

Hmm. Let's take the example of the string "(()())".

Processing this with a stack:

- i=0: '(', push 0.

- i=1: '(', push 1.

- i=2: ')', pop 1. Now, the valid substring is from 1 to 2: '()'. Also, since before 1 (i=0) was another '(', maybe there's a longer substring. But how?

Wait, perhaps after popping, the current valid length is i - stack[-1] (assuming stack is not empty). So, the stack can be used to track the positions of the unmatched opening brackets.

For example, when we pop the 1 (at i=2), the stack now has [0]. So the current valid substring is from stack[-1]+1 (0+1=1) to i (2), which is '()'. Then, at i=3, which is '(', we push 3. At i=4, ')', pop 3. Now, stack has [0]. The valid substring is from 3 to 4, which is '()'. Then, stack[-1] is 0, so the length is 4-0 =4? Wait, no. The valid substring starts at stack[-1] +1 (0+1=1) and ends at i=4. So the substring is s[1..4] = "()()", which is valid. So the current valid length is 4-0 =4? Not sure.

Wait, the stack approach can help track the start of the valid substring. For example, when you have a closing bracket at i, you pop the top of the stack (say j). Then, the valid substring starts at j+1 and ends at i. But how?

Wait, when you pop j from the stack, the matching opening bracket is at j, and the closing bracket is at i. So the substring s[j..i] is valid? No, because that would be the substring from j to i, which includes the matched pair. Wait, for example, j is the index of '(', i is the index of ')', so s[j..i] is "()". Then, the valid substring is from j to i. Then, if after popping j, the stack is not empty, the previous elements in the stack are the unmatched opening brackets. So the next valid substring could be from stack[-1]+1 to i. For example, if the stack after popping j has elements like k, then the substring from k+1 to i is valid.

But how does this capture all possible valid substrings?

Alternatively, the stack-based approach for the DP solution.

In the DP approach, for each i, we compute the length of the longest valid substring ending at i. Then, the DP formula is:

if s[i] == ')':
    if s[i-1] == '(':
        dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2
    else:
        if s[i - dp[i-1] -1] == '(':
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] -2] (if applicable)

But this gives the longest valid substring ending at i. However, this approach can find all possible valid substrings if we track all possibilities. But how?

Alternatively, for each position i, the DP array gives the maximum possible length of a valid substring ending at i. But there could be shorter valid substrings as well. For example, if the longest is 4, but there's a substring of length 2 as well.

But the standard DP approach only tracks the maximum length. So this approach alone isn't sufficient to find all possible valid substrings.

Hmm. So perhaps the DP approach isn't directly helpful here.

Alternative idea inspired by the problem of counting distinct palindromic substrings. In that problem, Manacher's algorithm is used to find all palindromic substrings, but for this problem, perhaps a similar approach can be used for valid parentheses.

But I'm not aware of such an algorithm.

Alternative approach: For each valid substring, the minimal possible way it is formed. For example, the minimal valid substring is "()", and any longer valid substring is formed by combining these minimal ones either by nesting or concatenation.

But how to find all such combinations.

Alternatively, think of the valid substrings as being built up from valid pairs. For example, whenever you find a pair, it's a valid substring. Then, if you have a pair that encloses another valid substring, like "(valid)", that's another valid substring. Or if you have two adjacent valid substrings, their concatenation is also valid.

But how to track all possible combinations of these.

But this seems to suggest that the valid substrings are all the possible combinations formed by nesting or concatenation. So perhaps, for each pair (i, j), we can check if the substring i..j is valid, and then collect all such substrings.

But again, the problem is how to do this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps using the stack approach to find all possible valid substrings.

Let me outline the stack approach again:

Initialize a stack with -1 (as a base for calculating lengths). Then, for each i from 0 to n-1:

- if s[i] is '(', push i onto the stack.

- else:
    pop the stack.
    if the stack is empty, push i as a new base.
    else:
        the current length is i - stack[-1]. This gives the length of a valid substring ending at i.

But how does this help in finding all possible valid substrings? For example, when a closing bracket is processed, the current valid substring is from stack[-1] +1 to i. So, each time after popping, if the stack is not empty, we can note that the substring starting at stack[-1]+1 to i is valid.

But this approach captures the maximal valid substring ending at i. For example, if the string is "(()())", when i is 5 (the last ')'), the stack after popping would have -1, and the current valid substring is from 0 to 5, which is the entire string. But there are other valid substrings within this.

But wait, how does the stack-based approach capture all possible valid substrings?

Let me take an example. Suppose the string is "()(())".

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5

Processing:

i=0: '(', stack becomes [-1, 0].

i=1: ')', pop 0, stack becomes [-1]. Current valid substring is 0 to 1: "()". 

i=2: '(', stack becomes [-1,2].

i=3: '(', stack becomes [-1,2,3].

i=4: ')', pop 3. Stack becomes [-1,2]. Current valid substring is 3-4: "()", but stack[-1] is 2, so the substring from 2+1=3 to 4: "()" (same as before). But the actual valid substring here is s[3..4] which is "()", and perhaps also s[2..4] which would be "(()", which is not valid. Wait, no. So the stack approach gives the substring from stack[-1]+1 to i. So after popping 3 (i=4), stack[-1] is 2, so the valid substring is from 2+1=3 to 4: "()". 

i=5: ')', pop 2. Stack becomes [-1]. Now, the valid substring is from 2+1=3 to 5: "())", which is not valid. Wait, but the actual substring from 0 to 5 is "()(())", which is valid. How does this fit?

Ah, perhaps the stack-based approach isn't correctly capturing all possible valid substrings. So maybe this approach is only suitable for finding the maximum valid length, not all possible valid substrings.

Hmm. So the stack approach might not capture all possible valid substrings. For instance, in the example above, the entire string is valid, but the approach would capture it when i=5 is processed. Let's see:

At i=5, which is ')', stack was [-1,2] (after popping 3 and 4 processed). Now, processing i=5:

Pop 2 from the stack. Then, stack becomes [-1]. Then, the current valid length is 5 - (-1) =6. So the substring from -1 +1=0 to 5 is the entire string, which is valid. So this would capture that.

Ah, right. So the stack approach captures all valid substrings as follows: for each closing bracket, when you pop the stack, the substring from stack[-1] +1 to i is a valid substring. So in the example above, when i=5, after popping 2, stack[-1] is -1, so the substring starts at 0 and ends at 5. Which is valid.

So, for each closing bracket, the valid substring is from stack[-1]+1 to i. So, each time we process a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, we get a valid substring. The key is to collect all these valid substrings and then count how many unique ones there are.

So, the approach is:

1. Use a stack to track the indices of opening brackets and bases (like -1) when the stack is empty.

2. For each closing bracket, after popping the stack, if the stack is not empty, compute the substring from stack[-1]+1 to i. This substring is valid.

3. Also, when we find such a substring, there may be other valid substrings that are part of this. For example, if the substring is long, like "(()())", then the entire substring is valid, but the inner parts like "()", "()", "(()())", etc., are also valid. However, the stack approach only captures the maximal valid substring ending at i.

But wait, how does this approach capture all possible valid substrings?

Let me think. Suppose we have a string like "()()". The stack approach would capture the substrings at positions 0-1 (i=1), then stack[-1] is -1. Then at i=3, after popping, the stack[-1] is 2 (assuming stack was pushed 2 and 3 is ')', etc.). Wait, perhaps this isn't correct. Let me process the string "()()".

Processing:

i=0: '(', stack becomes [-1,0].

i=1: ')', pop 0. Stack is [-1]. The valid substring is 0+1=0 to 1: s[0..1] is "()".

Then, push i=1 as a new base (since the stack was empty after popping, but then pushed i=1 as a new base? Wait, no. Let's re-express the stack approach:

The standard stack approach for valid parentheses:

Initialize stack with -1.

For each i in 0 to n-1:

   if s[i] is '(', push i.

   else:

      stack.pop()

      if stack is empty:

          push i.

      else:

          current_length = i - stack[-1]

So in the example of "()()", let's process each step:

n=4, indices 0,1,2,3.

stack starts as [-1].

i=0: '(', push 0. stack is [-1, 0].

i=1: ')', pop 0. stack is [-1].

   since stack is not empty, the current valid substring length is 1 - (-1) = 2. So the substring is s[0..1] = "()".

   Then, since stack is not empty, do we push anything? No. According to the algorithm, after popping, if stack is empty, push i. Else, do not push.

So after popping, stack is [-1], and since stack is not empty, we don't push.

i=2: '(', push 2. stack is [-1, 2].

i=3: ')', pop 2. stack is [-1].

   current_length is 3 - (-1) = 4. So the valid substring is s[0..3] = "()()".

But in reality, the valid substrings are "()", "()", and "()()". But according to this approach, when i=1, we get "()", and when i=3, we get "()()". The second "()" is from positions 2..3. But according to this approach, when i=3 is processed:

stack after popping 2 becomes [-1]. So current_length is 3 - (-1) =4. So the substring is 0..3. But why isn't the substring 2..3 captured?

Ah, I see. Because when i=3 is processed, after popping 2 (the '(' at index 2), the stack becomes [-1]. Then, the current valid substring starts at stack[-1] +1 = 0, so the substring is s[0..3]. But there's also a valid substring s[2..3] = "()".

But the stack approach in this case only captures the longer substring. So it misses the shorter ones.

So this indicates that the stack approach as described is not sufficient to capture all valid substrings. It captures the maximal valid substring ending at i, but not all possible valid substrings.

So the problem is that this approach captures the longest valid substring ending at each i, but not the shorter ones.

Thus, the stack approach alone isn't sufficient to find all valid substrings. So how can we modify this approach to capture all valid substrings?

Alternative idea: For each valid pair (a, b), which forms "()", we can note that it is a valid substring. Then, any valid substring can be formed by combining these pairs in a nested or adjacent way. So perhaps we can track all possible valid substrings by expanding around each such pair.

But this seems like an O(n^2) approach, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, think recursively: each time a pair is found, the substring is valid. Then, if there's a valid substring ending right before the start of this pair, their combination is a valid substring. For example, "()()" is formed by two adjacent pairs.

But how to track this.

Alternatively, for each valid pair (a, b), we can generate the substring s[a..b], then check if there's a valid substring ending at a-1, which when combined with this pair gives a longer valid substring. Then, recursively add those to the list.

But this again could be O(n^2).

But since the problem requires the distinct substrings, perhaps this approach can be optimized by generating the actual strings and adding them to a set. But for large n, this is not feasible.

So this brings us back to the original problem: how to count the distinct valid substrings efficiently.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that each valid substring is a balanced parentheses string, which can be uniquely represented by its structure. But how to represent that structure efficiently.

Wait, another idea: the valid substrings are determined by their balance and the way they are nested. So perhaps, for each valid substring, we can compute a hash based on the structure of the brackets. For example, using a running balance. When the balance returns to zero, we know that the substring up to that point is balanced. But how to track the actual structure.

Alternatively, the hash can be computed as the sequence of the balance changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the valid substring can be represented by its minimal representation. For example, each valid substring can be transformed into a certain structure, but again, this is unclear.

Another Idea: For each valid substring, its unique representation is the substring itself. So the problem reduces to finding all valid substrings and inserting them into a hash set, then returning the size of the set. But with n=5e5, this is O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not feasible.

But the constraints say time limit is 3 seconds and memory 512 MB. For 5e5, O(n^2) would be 2.5e11 operations, which is impossible. So we need a better way.

So the problem is to find the number of distinct valid substrings. So the solution must find a way to compute this count without explicitly checking each possible substring.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that valid substrings are balanced. So for each possible valid substring, its balance (number of opening minus closing) is zero. Also, during the traversal of the substring, the balance never drops below zero.

So perhaps for each position, we can track the balance and find where it returns to the same balance as a previous position, which indicates a potential valid substring.

Wait, this is the standard approach for finding the longest valid substring. Let's think about the balance approach. For example, we can keep a dictionary that maps balance values to their earliest occurrence. As we traverse the string, for each balance, if we encounter it again, the substring between those two positions is balanced.

But this approach is used to find the longest valid substring. How to modify this to find all valid substrings.

The balance approach:

Initialize a dictionary balance_map with {0: -1}.

current_balance = 0.

For each i in 0 to n-1:

    current_balance += 1 if s[i] is '(', else -1.

    if current_balance in balance_map:

        start = balance_map[current_balance] + 1

        end = i

        the substring s[start..end] is balanced.

        if during this substring, the balance never went below current_balance:

            then it's valid.

    else:

        balance_map[current_balance] = i.

But I'm not sure. The balance approach can help find substrings where the balance returns to a previous level. For example, if the balance at positions j and i is the same, then the substring j+1 to i is balanced. But for the substring to be valid, the balance must never drop below the current balance during this substring. Otherwise, there are points where the balance is less than the current balance, which indicates invalid parentheses.

So how to use this to find all valid substrings.

Hmm. For example, if we track the balance and store the first occurrence of each balance. Then, whenever the same balance is encountered, we can check if the substring between those indices is valid.

But how to ensure that the balance never drops below the starting balance during the substring.

This seems similar to the approach used in finding the longest valid substring. For example, the longest valid substring can be found by tracking the first occurrence of each balance and ensuring that between the first occurrence and current index, the balance doesn't drop below that.

But how to use this to find all valid substrings.

Perhaps, for each index i, track all possible starting indices j where the balance j to i is zero and the balance never drops below zero in between. Each such j to i is a valid substring.

But even this approach would require O(n^2) time if there are O(n^2) valid substrings.

But wait, how many valid substrings can there be?

In the worst case, like a string of all '()' repeated m times: "()()()...()". The valid substrings are all possible even-length sequences starting and ending with '()'. For this case, the number of valid substrings is O(n^2), which is 5e5^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible.

Thus, the problem must have a smarter way to count the distinct valid substrings.

Alternative Idea: The number of distinct valid substrings is limited by the structure of the string, and we can find a way to represent them using their positions in the string and some hashing.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The valid substrings can be categorized based on their structure, like being a simple pair, nested pairs, or concatenations. For example, any valid substring can be decomposed into a combination of these structures. Then, the count of distinct substrings can be found by tracking these structures as they appear in the string.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, since the valid substrings are balanced, each valid substring can be represented by a structure that can be generated by a deterministic context-free grammar. However, I'm not sure how to apply this here.

Hmm.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

10

()()()()()

Output: 5.

The valid substrings are "()", "()()", "()()()", "()()()()", "()()()()()". Each of these is a concatenation of the previous one with another "()". So they are all distinct.

Sample Input 2:

7

)(())()

Output: 3.

The valid substrings are "()", "(())", "(())()".

So in these cases, the valid substrings are either nested or concatenated.

The key is to find all such possible combinations and count the unique ones.

But again, how to do this efficiently.

Alternative approach: Using a stack to track all possible valid substrings and their starting positions, and for each new valid substring, compute the hash of the substring and add it to a set.

But this requires checking all possible valid substrings and their combinations.

Wait, let's try this. For each closing bracket, after popping the stack, we can get the start of the current valid substring. Then, any valid substring ending at that start-1 can be combined with the current substring. So for example, if the current substring is [a, b], and there's a valid substring ending at a-1 with length l, then the combined substring [a-l, b] is also valid.

So for each valid substring [a, b], we can find all possible combinations with previous valid substrings.

But how to track this.

Alternatively, for each valid substring [a, b], we can also consider all possible previous valid substrings ending at a-1 and combine them with [a, b]. Each combination would be a new valid substring.

But this approach would generate all possible valid substrings by combining adjacent ones.

However, this approach may not capture all valid substrings, such as nested ones.

But perhaps combining the stack approach with dynamic programming can help track all possible valid substrings.

Alternatively, here's a possible plan:

1. Use a stack to track the indices of the opening brackets.

2. For each closing bracket, when it forms a valid pair, note the substring from the popped index to current index as a valid substring. Also, check if there are any valid substrings ending right before the popped index. For example, if after popping, the previous index is the end of a valid substring, then combining them forms a longer valid substring.

3. For each valid substring found, add its hash to a set.

But how to efficiently compute the hash of the substring. The problem is that the substring can be up to O(n) in length, and hashing each substring would take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2) total time.

Thus, this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative Idea: Use a rolling hash for the entire string. Then, for each valid substring [a, b], compute its hash in O(1) time using the rolling hash.

If we precompute the rolling hash for the entire string, then for any substring [a, b], the hash can be computed as (hash[b] - hash[a-1] * base^(b-a+1)) mod mod_value. This requires precomputing the prefix hashes and the powers of the base.

But with this, the hash for any substring can be computed in O(1) time, which allows us to add it to a hash set in O(1) time (per substring).

Thus, this could reduce the time complexity.

So, the steps would be:

1. Precompute the rolling hash for the entire string, along with the powers of the base.

2. Use the stack-based approach to find all possible valid substrings, and for each, compute their hash using the rolling hash and add to a set.

3. Finally, return the size of the set.

But how to find all valid substrings using the stack approach.

As discussed earlier, the stack approach can find certain valid substrings (like the maximal ones), but misses others. So how to find all valid substrings.

Alternatively, when a valid substring is found, we can check all possible valid substrings contained within it. For example, if we have a substring [a, b], then all valid substrings that are contained within [a, b] can be processed. But how.

This seems tricky. Perhaps, the problem requires a different approach.

Another Idea: Every valid substring must be a balanced parentheses string. Therefore, the minimal valid substring is "()", and all others are formed by either nesting or concatenation. So perhaps, each valid substring can be uniquely identified by the sequence of its nesting and concatenation steps.

But how to track this.

Alternatively, the valid substrings can be represented by their structure. For example, each valid substring is either:

- A single pair "()".

- A pair enclosing another valid substring: "(X)".

- The concatenation of two valid substrings X and Y: "XY".

Thus, the valid substrings form a structure that can be represented as a tree. But how to track this structure as we process the string.

But I'm not sure how to use this to count the distinct substrings.

Alternative Idea: For each valid substring, the minimal possible left and right indices. For example, if a substring is "()", it can be uniquely identified by its start and end indices. But in terms of the string content, if there are multiple occurrences of "()", they will have the same hash. Thus, using a rolling hash and a set to track hashes can allow us to count distinct substrings.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute rolling hash for the string.

2. Use a stack to track the indices of opening brackets.

3. For each closing bracket, when we pop a matching opening bracket, the substring from stack[-1]+1 to current index is valid. Then, any valid substring that starts at stack[-1]+1 and ends at current index is a valid substring. Additionally, if there are previous valid substrings ending just before stack[-1]+1, their concatenation is also valid. But how to track this.

This seems to bring us back to the DP approach. Let's think about the DP approach again.

The DP array dp[i] represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at i.

For example, if s[i] is ')', then if s[i-1] is '(', then dp[i] = 2 + dp[i-2].

If s[i-1] is ')', then check if s[i - dp[i-1] -1] is '(', and if so, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] -2], etc.

But the DP array tracks the longest valid substring ending at i. However, there can be shorter valid substrings as well.

But perhaps for each i, there are multiple valid substrings ending at i, not just the longest one.

So how to track all of them.

This seems difficult. For example, in the string "(()())", the valid substrings ending at index 5 are "()", "(()())", and "()(()())" (if there is a previous valid substring), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP approach can be modified to track all possible valid substrings ending at each index.

But that would require storing a list of all possible lengths for each i, which could be O(n) per index, leading to O(n^2) time and space, which is not feasible.

Thus, another Idea: For each valid substring [a, b], we can find it by checking if the substring s[a..b] is valid. But to avoid checking all possible substrings, perhaps we can use the fact that the valid substrings are those that can be processed by the stack approach, and their nested or concatenated counterparts.

But how to find all of them.

Another Idea inspired by the problem of finding all palindromic substrings using Manacher's algorithm, which finds all palindromes in linear time. Similarly, perhaps there's a way to find all valid substrings in linear or O(n) time.

But I'm not aware of such an algorithm.

Hmm. Let's think differently. What's the maximum number of distinct valid substrings possible?

Each valid substring is a balanced string, which can be formed by the rules:

- Empty string (not considered here).

- A balanced string enclosed in a pair of brackets.

- The concatenation of two balanced strings.

The number of such strings is infinite in general, but for a given string of length n, the maximum possible distinct valid substrings is O(n^2), which is 2.5e11 for n=5e5. But this is impossible to handle.

But given the sample inputs, the answer is much smaller. So perhaps the problem allows an optimized approach based on certain properties.

Wait, the problem requires counting the number of distinct valid substrings in the input string. So the actual number of such substrings is dependent on the input's structure.

For example, a string like "((((...))))" (n even) would have O(n) distinct valid substrings: each possible nested level.

Another example, "()()()..." would have O(n) distinct valid substrings (each possible concatenation of k pairs, where k ranges from 1 to n/2).

Thus, in some cases, the number of distinct valid substrings is O(n), which is manageable.

So, perhaps the solution is to find all possible valid substrings using the stack approach and then track their hash in a set. But this would work only if the number of valid substrings is O(n).

But in the worst case, where the string is "()()()...", the number of valid substrings is O(n^2), which is impossible to track even with a hash set.

But according to the problem's constraints, n can be up to 5e5, so the algorithm must work even in such cases.

This suggests that there's a way to find the number of distinct valid substrings without enumerating all possible valid substrings.

So, there must be a mathematical property or a way to model the valid substrings in a way that allows counting the distinct ones efficiently.

Let's think about the structure of valid substrings.

Each valid substring can be represented as a balanced string. Balanced strings can be represented by their nesting depth and the sequence of operations (open, close).

But how to represent this uniquely.

Alternative Idea: The canonical form of a valid substring is determined by the pattern of the brackets. So, two different intervals in the string that form the same bracket sequence contribute one to the count.

But how to model this.

Another Idea: For each valid substring, the sequence is a string that can be uniquely determined by the structure of the brackets. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of different such strings that appear as substrings.

This is similar to counting the number of distinct substrings in a string, but restricted to those substrings that are valid.

But the standard way to count distinct substrings is to use a suffix automaton, which is linear in time and space. So, if we can build a suffix automaton for the input string and then query the number of valid substrings, that would be efficient.

But how to determine which states in the suffix automaton correspond to valid substrings.

This seems like a possible solution. Here's the plan:

1. Build a suffix automaton for the input string s.

2. For each state in the automaton, determine if the corresponding substring is a valid parentheses string.

3. Sum the number of distinct valid substrings.

The suffix automaton can be built in O(n) time and space. Then, for each state, we need to check if the substring(s) it represents are valid.

But how to check this efficiently.

The suffix automaton represents all distinct substrings of s. Each state corresponds to a set of substrings (the equivalence classes). So, for each state, we can find the minimal length of the substrings it represents and the maximal length. But how to check if any of those substrings is a valid parentheses string.

But the problem requires that the substring is valid. So, for a state to contribute, there must be at least one substring in its equivalence class that is valid.

But this approach seems challenging. Because for each state, we need to determine if there exists a substring represented by the state that is valid.

Alternatively, for each valid substring, it will be represented by some state in the suffix automaton, and we need to count each such state once.

But how to determine which states correspond to valid substrings.

Another Idea: For each state in the suffix automaton, track the balance (number of '(' minus ')') and the minimum balance in the substring. A substring is valid if and only if:

- Total balance is 0.

- The minimum balance during the substring is >= 0.

But how to compute these for all possible substrings represented by the automaton.

Alternatively, for each state in the suffix automaton, we can precompute the balance and the minimal balance of the substrings it represents.

But integrating this with the suffix automaton is not straightforward.

Another Idea: Precompute for each position in the string the balance and the minimal balance up to that position. Then, for each possible substring [i, j], compute the balance (sum) and the minimal balance. If the total balance is 0 and the minimal balance is >= 0, then it's a valid substring.

But checking every possible substring [i,j] is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is also not feasible.

So, returning to the initial idea of using the stack approach to track valid substrings and using rolling hash to track their uniqueness.

But how to handle all valid substrings.

Wait, perhaps every valid substring can be found by the stack approach as follows:

Every time a closing bracket is processed, the current valid substring (from stack[-1]+1 to current index) is valid, and possibly combining it with previous valid substrings.

For example, if there's a valid substring ending at stack[-1], then the combination is also valid.

Thus, when a valid substring is found, we can not only add it to the set, but also combine it with any previous valid substrings ending at stack[-1].

But how to track these.

Alternatively, when a valid substring [a, b] is found, we can also check if there are valid substrings ending at a-1. If so, then the concatenation of those substrings with [a, b] is also valid.

This suggests a recursive approach where each valid substring is combined with previous ones to form longer valid substrings.

But how to implement this without enumerating all possibilities.

Perhaps, for each valid substring [a, b], we can track the start and end indices, and then use the rolling hash to compute the hash of the entire valid substring. Then, add this hash to a set. But this would miss nested valid substrings.

For example, in "(()())", the entire substring is valid, but so are the inner "()" and "()()".

So, the stack approach would capture the entire substring when i=5 is processed. But the inner substrings are captured at earlier steps.

Thus, the stack approach would capture all valid substrings, but only the maximal ones. However, in the stack approach, each valid substring is processed when a closing bracket is found, and for each such case, the substring from stack[-1]+1 to i is valid.

So, for example, in the string "(()())":

- At i=1 (closing bracket), stack becomes [-1,0]. Popping 0, stack is [-1]. The valid substring is from 0+1=0 to 1: s[0..1] is "()".

- At i=2 (opening bracket), pushed.

- At i=3 (opening bracket), pushed.

- At i=4 (closing bracket), popped. stack is [ -1,0,2]. The valid substring is 3+1=3 to 4: s[3..4] is "()".

- At i=5 (closing bracket), popped. stack is [ -1,0]. The valid substring is 2+1=2 to 5: s[2..5] is "(())".

Then, stack is [-1,0], and the current valid substring is s[0+1=0 to 5], which is "(()())".

So, in this case, the stack approach captures all three valid substrings: "()", "()", "(())", "(()())", but how?

Wait, the steps are:

At i=1: "()" added.

At i=4: "()" added.

At i=5: "(())" added and "(()())" added.

Thus, each time a closing bracket is processed, a valid substring is added. So the stack approach captures all possible valid substrings that are formed by the maximal possible pairs.

But in the example above, the inner "()" at i=4 is captured, and the longer substrings at i=5.

Thus, the stack approach captures all valid substrings that are not nested within other valid substrings.

But in the example of "()()", the stack approach captures the two "()" substrings and the combined "()()" substring.

Thus, it seems that the stack approach captures all possible valid substrings. Because every valid substring must be enclosed in a pair of brackets that forms a valid pair, and the stack approach tracks each such pair.

But how?

When a closing bracket is processed, the stack pops the matching opening bracket. Then, the substring from stack[-1]+1 to current index is valid. This includes all possible valid substrings formed by this pair and any previous valid substrings.

Thus, each valid substring is captured by the stack approach.

So, the solution is:

- Use the stack approach to find all possible valid substrings.

- For each valid substring, compute its hash using a rolling hash.

- Add each hash to a set.

- Finally, return the size of the set.

But this requires that the stack approach captures all valid substrings. Is this true?

Yes. Because any valid substring is a balanced string. The stack approach captures all valid substrings as follows: whenever a closing bracket is processed, the corresponding opening bracket is popped from the stack. The substring from stack[-1]+1 to current index is valid. This captures the maximal valid substring ending at current index. But if there are shorter valid substrings nested inside, those would have been processed in previous steps.

For example, in the string "((()))", the valid substrings are "((()))", "(())", and "()". The stack approach would capture "()" at i=5, then "(())" at i=3, then "((()))" at i=5 again. But wait, let's process this step by step.

Processing "((()))":

Indices 0: '(', push to stack.

1: '(', push.

2: '(', push.

3: ')', pop 2. stack is [0,1]. Valid substring from 2 to 3: s[2..3] = "()".

4: ')', pop 1. stack is [0]. Valid substring from 1+1=1 to4: s[1..4] = "(())".

5: ')', pop 0. stack is [-1]. Valid substring from 0+1=0 to5: s[0..5] = "((()))".

Thus, the stack approach captures all three valid substrings: "()", "(())", and "((()))".

So, it appears that the stack approach does capture all valid substrings. Therefore, the approach of using the stack to find all valid substrings and then adding their hash to a set is correct.

Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.

Implementing this approach:

We need to process each closing bracket, and for each valid substring found (from stack[-1]+1 to current index), compute the hash and add it to a set. Also, the code must handle the case where multiple valid substrings end at the same index, like in the example "()()".

But in the stack approach, each valid substring is captured exactly once. For example, in "()()", when i=1 is processed, the substring [0..1] is added. When i=3 is processed, the substring [0..3] is added, which includes the previous two "()" pairs.

But also, when i=3 is processed, the code will add the substring from stack[-1]+1 (which is -1+1=0) to i=3, which is the entire "()()" string.

But in the sample input 1, the code would capture the valid substrings of length 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. But how? Because for each closing bracket at positions 1,3,5,7,9, the stack approach would capture the current valid substring.

For example, in the sample input 1:

Indices 0: '(', stack becomes [-1, 0].

1: ')', pop 0, stack is [-1]. Add substring 0..1: "()".

2: '(', stack becomes [-1, 2].

3: ')', pop 2, stack is [-1]. Add substring 2..3: "()". But the valid substring from 0..3 is also captured when i=3 is processed. Because after popping 2, the stack is [-1], so the current valid substring is from 0 to3. So, in this case, the code would add "()", "()", "()()".

But wait, no. Let's see:

Processing i=3:

- After popping 2, stack is [-1]. So the valid substring is from 0 to 3. So the code adds this substring to the set. So the code adds "()()".

Similarly, for i=5, the code would add the substring from 0 to5, which is "()()()".

Thus, in this case, each closing bracket at even indices (1,3,5,7,9) adds a new valid substring of increasing length. The code would add all these to the set, resulting in 5 distinct substrings.

This matches the sample input 1.

Thus, the code would capture all valid substrings by processing each closing bracket and adding the corresponding valid substring to the set.

Thus, the algorithm would work.

Now, the implementation.

Steps:

1. Precompute the rolling hash for the string.

2. Use a stack to track the indices of opening brackets and bases.

3. For each closing bracket, process as follows:

   a. Pop the stack.

   b. If the stack is empty, push current index as a new base.

   c. Else, compute the valid substring from stack[-1]+1 to current index.

   d. Compute the hash of this substring and add to a set.

But how to compute the hash quickly.

Implementing rolling hash:

We can use a prefix hash array and a power array. For example, using a base like 911382629 and a large prime modulo.

For each prefix, compute hash[i] = hash[i-1] * base + s[i].

Then, the hash of substring [a..b] can be computed as (hash[b] - hash[a-1] * power[b-a+1]) mod mod_value.

Thus, we need to precompute the prefix hashes and the power array.

But for n up to 5e5, this is feasible.

But in Python, we need to handle large exponents. However, by precomputing the power array with mod operations, we can manage.

Thus, the code outline is:

- Read n and s.

- Precompute prefix hashes and power array.

- Initialize stack with -1.

- Initialize a set to store the hash values.

- Iterate over each character in s:

   for i in range(n):

      if s[i] == '(':

          stack.append(i)

      else:

          stack.pop()

          if not stack:

              stack.append(i)

          else:

              a = stack[-1] + 1

              b = i

              substring_hash = get_hash(a, b)

              hash_set.add(substring_hash)

- The answer is the size of hash_set.

But this code would only capture the valid substrings [a, b] as per the stack approach. But does this capture all valid substrings?

In the example of "(()())", this code would capture:

i=1:

   stack after popping is [-1], a=0, b=1. substring is "()".

i=4:

   stack after popping is [ -1,0,2], a=3, b=4. substring is "()".

i=5:

   stack after popping is [-1,0], a=2+1=3? No. Wait, stack after popping is [ -1,0], because the current index is 5.

Wait, let's process the example "(()())":

Indices 0: '(', stack becomes [-1, 0].

index 1: '(', stack becomes [-1,0,1].

index 2: ')', pop 1. stack becomes [-1,0]. a=0+1=1, b=2. substring is s[1..2] = "()". add to set.

index 3: '(', stack becomes [-1,0,3].

index4: ')', pop 3. stack becomes [-1,0]. a=0+1=1, b=4. substring s[1..4] is "()()". add to set.

index5: ')', pop 0. stack becomes [-1]. a=-1+1=0, b=5. substring s[0..5] is "(()())". add to set.

Thus, the code would add the hashes of "()", "()()", and "(()())". But the valid substrings in this case are also "(()", which is not valid. So the code correctly captures the valid substrings.

But in the example "(()())", the valid substrings are "()" (indices 1-2), "()" (indices 3-4), "()()" (indices 1-4), "(()())" (indices 0-5), and "(())" (indices 0-3? No, that's "(()", which is invalid).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let's re-examine the example "(()())" (indices 0-5):

The valid substrings are:

Indices 1-2: "()".

Indices 3-4: "()".

Indices 0-5: "(()())".

Indices 0-3: "(()" â€” invalid.

Indices 2-5: "())" â€” invalid.

But the code captures the substrings:

At i=2: a=1, b=2: "()".

At i=4: a=1, b=4: "()()".

At i=5: a=0, b=5: "(()())".

Wait, no. Let's re-process:

At i=2 (index 2 is ')'):

stack starts as [-1,0,1]. Pop 1, stack becomes [-1,0]. a = stack[-1] + 1 = 0 +1 =1. b=2. substring is s[1..2] = "()".

At i=4 (index 4 is ')'):

stack starts as [-1,0,3]. Pop 3, stack becomes [-1,0]. a =0+1=1. b=4. substring s[1..4] = "()()".

At i=5 (index 5 is ')'):

stack starts as [-1,0]. Pop 0, stack becomes [-1]. a =-1+1=0. substring s[0..5] = "(()())".

Thus, the code adds three substrings: "()", "()()", "(()())".

But the valid substrings in this example should also include the "(())" substring from 0-3? No, s[0-3] is "(()(", which is invalid.

Wait, no. The indices are 0,1,2,3,4,5:

s[0] = '(', s[1] = '(', s[2] = ')', s[3] = '(', s[4] = ')', s[5] = ')'.

So the substring from 0 to 3 is "(()(", which is invalid. The valid substrings in this example are:

"()" (1-2), "()" (3-4), "()()" (1-4), "(()())" (0-5), and "(())" (0-5? No. Wait, the entire string is "(()())", which is valid, and there's also the substring from 0-5, which is "(()())".

But where is the "(())" substring? Let's see:

The substring from 0 to 3 is "(()(" â€” invalid.

The substring from 2 to 5 is "))()" â€” invalid.

Ah, I see. So in this example, the code captures three valid substrings: "()", "()()", and "(()())". But the sample input 2 has output 3, which includes "(())". So perhaps this example is different.

Wait, the sample input 2 is ")(())()", which has valid substrings "()", "(())", and "(())()".

So the code for that example would process:

Initial stack: [-1].

i=0: ')', pop -1. stack is empty, so push 0.

i=1: '(', push 1.

i=2: '(', push 2.

i=3: ')', pop 2. stack is [1]. a=1+1=2, b=3. substring is s[2..3] = "()". add to set.

i=4: ')', pop 1. stack is empty. push 4.

i=5: '(', push 5.

i=6: ')', pop 5. stack is [4]. a=4+1=5, b=6. substring is s[5..6] = "()". add to set.

Thus, the code would add two "()" substrings and one "()" again. But sample input 2's output is 3.

Ah, this suggests that the code as outlined is not capturing all valid substrings.

So what's wrong?

In sample input 2:

s = ")(())()"

Indices 0: ')', stack after processing: push 0.

i=1: '(', pushed. stack is [0,1].

i=2: '(', pushed. stack is [0,1,2].

i=3: ')', popped 2. stack is [0,1]. a=1+1=2, b=3. substring is s[2..3] = "()". add to set.

i=4: ')', popped 1. stack is [0]. a=0+1=1, b=4. substring is s[1..4] = "(())". add to set.

i=5: '(', pushed. stack is [0,5].

i=6: ')', popped 5. stack is [0]. a=0+1=1, b=6. substring is s[1..6] = "(())()". add to set.

Thus, the code would add three substrings: "()", "(())", and "(())()". So the code would produce the correct output of 3.

Thus, the code correctly captures the valid substrings.

Thus, the code works for this case.

Thus, the stack approach captures all valid substrings.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, the code must compute the rolling hash for the valid substrings and add them to a set.

But for large n, we need to choose a good base and mod to minimize collisions. However, for the purpose of passing all test cases, using a double hash (two different bases and mods) could reduce collision chances, but in practice, a single hash with a large base and mod might suffice.

Thus, the code will precompute the prefix hashes and the power array.

But in Python, handling large exponents with mod can be done with precomputed power arrays.

Thus, the code outline is:

Implement the rolling hash with a large base and mod.

Precompute the prefix hashes and powers.

Implement the stack-based approach.

For each valid substring [a, b], compute its hash and add to a set.

Finally, return the size of the set.

Now, implementing this.

But for the hash computation, the indices are 0-based. So for a substring [a, b], the characters are s[a], s[a+1], ..., s[b].

The code for the hash computation is:

hash_val = (prefix_hash[b] - prefix_hash[a-1] * power[b - a + 1]) % mod

But when a is 0, prefix_hash[a-1] is prefix_hash[-1], which is not possible. So, we can adjust by using a prefix_hash array where prefix_hash[0] corresponds to the first character, and prefix_hash[i] is the hash of the first i+1 characters.

Alternatively, we can define prefix_hash[0] = 0, prefix_hash[1] = s[0], etc. But this depends on the implementation.

Let's define prefix_hash as follows:

prefix_hash[0] = 0.

prefix_hash[i] = (prefix_hash[i-1] * base + ord(s[i-1])) % mod.

Then, the hash of substring s[a..b] (0-based, a <= b, indices 0-based) is:

hash_val = (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[b - a + 1]) % mod.

Yes.

Thus, the code will:

- Precompute prefix_hash and power.

- For a substring from a to b (inclusive), the hash is computed as (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[b - a + 1]) % mod.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

Read s.

Compute base and mod (choose suitable values).

Precompute prefix_hash.

Precompute power.

Initialize stack.

Process each character, track the valid substrings.

Compute their hash and add to the set.

Finally, return the size of the set.

Now, choosing the base and mod.

To reduce collision probability, use two different base and mod pairs. But this may complicate things and increase time. For the problem, perhaps a single large base and mod would suffice.

For example:

base = 911382629

mod = 10^18 + 3

But in Python, even large numbers are handled.

But precomputing power up to 5e5+1 may be time-consuming, but feasible.

Thus, the code:

But we need to precompute the prefix_hash and power arrays.

Implement this:

max_n = 5e5 + 10.

But in practice, the code can compute the prefix_hash and power arrays on the fly.

Now, code:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

mod = 10**18 + 3
base = 911382629

prefix_hash = [0] * (n + 1)
power = [1] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n):
    prefix_hash[i+1] = (prefix_hash[i] * base + ord(s[i])) % mod
    power[i+1] = (power[i] * base) % mod

stack = [-1]
hash_set = set()

for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == '(':
        stack.append(i)
    else:
        stack.pop()
        if not stack:
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            a = stack[-1] + 1
            b = i
            current_len = b - a + 1
            hash_val = (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[current_len]) % mod
            hash_set.add(hash_val)

print(len(hash_set))

But wait, in the code, for the substring [a, b], the hash is computed as (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[b - a + 1]) % mod.

Yes.

Testing this code with sample input 1:

Input:

10

()()()()()

The code processes each ')', adding the following substrings:

i=0: '(', pushed.

i=1: ')', popped 0. stack is [-1]. a=0, b=1. current_len=2. hash_val is computed.

Then, the substring is "()". Added to the set.

i=2: '(', pushed.

i=3: ')', popped 2. stack is [-1]. a=0, b=3. substring is "()()". hash added.

i=4: '(', pushed.

i=5: ')', popped4. stack is [-1]. a=0, b=5. substring "()()()". hash added.

i=6: '(', pushed.

i=7: ')', popped6. stack is [-1]. a=0, b=7. substring "()()()()". hash added.

i=8: '(', pushed.

i=9: ')', popped8. stack is [-1]. a=0, b=9. substring "()()()()()". hash added.

Thus, the set will have 5 elements, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 2:

7

)(())()

The code processes:

i=0: ')', stack is popped (original stack is [-1]. popped -1, stack empty. Push 0.

i=1: '(', pushed. stack [0, 1].

i=2: '(', pushed. stack [0,1,2].

i=3: ')', popped 2. stack [0,1]. a=1+1=2, b=3. substring "()". hash added.

i=4: ')', popped 1. stack [0]. a=0+1=1, b=4. substring "(())". hash added.

i=5: '(', pushed. stack [0,5].

i=6: ')', popped5. stack [0]. a=0+1=1, b=6. substring "(())()". hash added.

Thus, the set has three elements, matching the sample output.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

But what about cases where the same substring appears multiple times but is added only once?

For example, if the string is "((()))", the code adds "()" (indices 2-3), "(())" (indices 1-4), and "((()))" (indices 0-5). Each of these is a distinct substring.

Thus, the code will correctly count the distinct valid substrings.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, considering time and memory constraints.

The code precomputes prefix_hash and power arrays, each of size n+1, which is O(n) space. The stack is O(n) in worst case. The hash_set can be O(n) in the worst case (if each valid substring is unique).

Time-wise, the code is O(n) for the loops. Rolling hash computations are O(1) per substring.

Thus, the code should be efficient enough for n up to 5e5.

```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

mod = 10**18 + 3
base = 911382629

prefix_hash = [0] * (n + 1)
power = [1] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n):
    prefix_hash[i+1] = (prefix_hash[i] * base + ord(s[i])) % mod
    power[i+1] = (power[i] * base) % mod

stack = [-1]
hash_set = set()

for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == '(':
        stack.append(i)
    else:
        stack.pop()
        if not stack:
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            a = stack[-1] + 1
            b = i
            current_len = b - a + 1
            hash_val = (prefix_hash[b+1] - prefix_hash[a] * power[current_len]) % mod
            hash_set.add(hash_val)

print(len(hash_set))
