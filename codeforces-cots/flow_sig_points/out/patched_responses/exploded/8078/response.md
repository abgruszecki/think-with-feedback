<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. Hmm. So, we have a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n vertices and m edges. The sources (no incoming edges) and sinks (no outgoing edges) are equal in number, let's say k each. The sources are ordered by their vertex numbers, and the same for the sinks. 

The problem is about counting the total number of path sets that form certain permutations of the sources to sinks, considering the parity of the number of inversions in those permutations. Then, for all possible such path sets, sum up 1 if the inversion count is even, -1 if it's odd, modulo p.

Wait, the key here is that each valid set of paths corresponds to a permutation of the sinks (or sources?), where each source is mapped to a sink via a path, and the paths are vertex-disjoint. Then, the permutation's inversion count determines whether we add +1 or -1 to the total.

The main challenge is to compute the sum over all possible valid path sets of (-1)^(number of inversions in the permutation), modulo p.

But how do we model this? Because for each possible permutation (from sources to sinks), we need to compute the number of path sets that correspond to that permutation (i.e., vertex-disjoint paths from source i to sink sigma(i) for all i), multiplied by the sign of the permutation (which is (-1)^inversions). Then the total sum is the sum over all permutations sigma of (number of valid path sets for sigma) multiplied by sgn(sigma), where sgn is the sign of the permutation.

So the answer is the determinant of a certain matrix. Because determinant is the sum over all permutations of the product of entries multiplied by the sign. Oh! So the problem reduces to computing the determinant of a matrix where the (i,j) entry is the number of vertex-disjoint paths from source i to sink j, considering that the paths for different (i,j) pairs don't share any vertices.

Wait, but how do the vertex-disjoint paths for a permutation sigma form the entries? Because in the determinant, each term corresponds to a permutation sigma, and the product is the product of matrix entries M_i,sigma(i), and each such product is multiplied by sgn(sigma). So if each M[i][j] is the number of ways to have a path from source i to sink j, but such that all the paths in the permutation are vertex-disjoint, then the determinant would exactly represent the sum we need. But how?

Ah, right! The determinant of a matrix M where M[i][j] is the number of vertex-disjoint path systems for the permutation that maps i to j. But wait, perhaps each M[i][j] is the number of paths from source i to sink j, but when considering that for a permutation sigma, the set of paths must be vertex-disjoint. So for the permutation sigma, the total number of path systems is the product of the number of paths from source i to sigma(i) for each i, but only if those paths are pairwise vertex-disjoint. But calculating that product would not account for overlapping paths.

So, the problem is similar to finding a permutation's contribution as the product of individual paths, but ensuring that the paths are vertex-disjoint. That sounds exactly like the problem of computing the determinant of a matrix where M[i][j] is the number of paths from source i to sink j, but in such a way that the paths for different pairs (i,j) do not share any vertices. Wait, but how is that possible? Because the paths are allowed to share nodes if they belong to the same permutation's mapping? No, no. The problem states that the paths must not intersect at any vertices. So each path in the set is vertex-disjoint with all others.

But calculating the determinant under such a condition is not straightforward. Wait, but perhaps there's a way to model this using inclusion-exclusion, or some combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such path systems can be represented as the determinant of a matrix where each entry is the number of paths from source i to sink j. Wait, that's possible if the graph is such that any two paths from different sources to different sinks are vertex-disjoint. But that's generally not the case. For example, two paths might share some internal nodes.

Hmm. So the key insight here is that the problem is equivalent to computing the determinant of the matrix where M[i][j] is the number of paths from source i to sink j. Because when you compute the determinant, each permutation's contribution is multiplied by the sign, and the product of the paths for each permutation. But the determinant counts all possible combinations where each permutation's paths are allowed to have overlapping vertices, which is not what we want. So this approach would overcount. Therefore, this can't be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the determinant approach works under certain conditions, but how?

Wait, let's think again. Suppose we have a bipartite graph between sources and sinks. Then, the number of vertex-disjoint path systems would correspond to the number of perfect matchings where each path is from a source to a sink and they are vertex-disjoint. But in general, even in bipartite graphs, the number of such matchings is not the determinant. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using some matrix where each entry represents the number of paths between a source and a sink, but with the condition that all paths in the system are vertex-disjoint. How can that matrix be built?

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each possible path from source i to sink j is an edge, and then the problem reduces to finding the determinant of the adjacency matrix of this bipartite graph. But that's not correct either.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of vertex-disjoint path systems is equal to the determinant of a matrix where each entry (i,j) is the number of paths from source i to sink j. But how?

Let me think of a simple example. Suppose we have two sources and two sinks, and each source can reach each sink via exactly one path. If the paths for (1→1) and (2→2) are vertex-disjoint, then the product is 1. Similarly, if the paths for (1→2) and (2→1) are vertex-disjoint, then that's another term. The determinant would be 1*1 - 1*1 = 0, which would be the case if those two permutations are possible. But if the paths (1→2) and (2→1) share a vertex, then the product for that permutation is zero, so the determinant would be 1*1 - 0 = 1. So the determinant in this case would correctly capture the sum of +1 (for the even inversion) and -1 (for the odd inversion) multiplied by the number of possible path systems.

Wait, this suggests that the determinant approach is correct. So the answer is the determinant of the matrix M where M[i][j] is the number of paths from source i to sink j, but considering that when you take a permutation sigma, the product M[1][sigma(1)] * M[2][sigma(2)] ... M[k][sigma(k)] counts the number of ways to choose paths from each source to their assigned sink, but without considering vertex-disjointness. But then, the determinant would not account for the vertex-disjointness requirement. So this approach would count paths that may share vertices, which is invalid for the problem.

But according to the problem's sample input, for example, the first sample has two paths (1→3 and 2→4), which are vertex-disjoint. The determinant here would be M[1][1] * M[2][2] - M[1][2] * M[2][1}. But in this case, M[1][2] would be zero, since the first source (vertex 1) can't reach the second sink (vertex 4) via any path. Wait, the first sample's graph is 1->3 and 2->4. So the sources are 1 and 2 (no incoming edges), sinks are 3 and 4 (no outgoing edges). Wait, no. Wait, sources are nodes with no incoming edges. Sinks are nodes with no outgoing edges. So in the first sample, the graph has edges 1→3, 2→4. So for node 3, it has no outgoing edges. So sinks are 3 and 4. Sources are 1 and 2. The sources are ordered in increasing order (1,2), sinks in increasing order (3,4). The path set is each source to the corresponding sink. The permutation here is the identity permutation (sigma(1) = 3? Wait no. Wait, the sources are ordered 1,2 (sources), sinks ordered 3,4. So when the problem says the i-th source and j-th sink, perhaps the permutation is between the indices of the sources and sinks. For example, in the first sample, the sources are [1,2], sinks are [3,4]. So each source i (1-based index) is connected to sink j (1-based index) via a path. So for the first sample, sigma is the permutation (1→1, 2→2) (since source 1 goes to sink 1 (3), source 2 goes to sink 2 (4)). The permutation's inversion count is zero. So the determinant here is 1*1 (since there's one path from 1→3 and 1→3 is the first source to first sink. So the matrix M would be [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. The determinant is 1*1 - 0*0 =1, which matches the sample output. So that works.

But how does this matrix account for vertex-disjoint paths? Because in the first sample, the paths are 1→3 and 2→4. These paths are vertex-disjoint, so the permutation's product is 1*1=1, and the sign is positive. The determinant gives 1, which is correct.

Another sample: the second input. The graph is 4→1 and 3→2. Sources are the ones with no incoming edges. Let's see: for node 4, incoming edges? None. Node 3: incoming edges? None. So sources are 3 and 4. Sinks are nodes with no outgoing edges. Node 1 has no outgoing edges (assuming the edge is 4→1). Node 2 has no outgoing edges. So sinks are 1 and 2. Sources are ordered 3,4. Sinks ordered 1,2. The possible path set is 3→2 (since 3 has an edge to 2?), wait no. Wait, the edges are 4→1 and 3→2. So source 3 can go to sink 2 (via edge 3→2), source 4 can go to sink 1 (via 4→1). So the permutation is sigma(1) = 2 and sigma(2) =1. The number of inversions is 1 (since 1 <2 and sigma(1) =2 > sigma(2)=1). So the sign is -1. The determinant matrix M would be:

M[1][1] is the number of paths from source 3 (first source) to sink 1 (first sink). But 3 can't reach 1. So that's zero. M[1][2] is the number of paths from source 3 to sink 2, which is 1. M[2][1] is paths from source 4 to sink 1: 1. M[2][2] is source 4 to sink 2: zero. So the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The determinant is (0*0) - (1*1) = -1, which matches the sample's output of -1 mod p.

So this suggests that the correct approach is to model the problem as the determinant of a matrix where M[i][j] is the number of paths from the i-th source to the j-th sink, and the determinant's value is the required sum. But why does this work when the determinant counts all possible path combinations for each permutation, even if the paths share vertices? Because in the samples, when the paths are not vertex-disjoint, their product would contribute to the determinant but the actual problem requires that the paths are vertex-disjoint. So how does the determinant account for that?

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe in the problem, the paths are required to be vertex-disjoint. So, the matrix M[i][j] should represent the number of paths from source i to sink j, such that for any permutation, all the paths selected for the permutation are pairwise vertex-disjoint. But how can that be modeled?

Alternatively, perhaps the key insight is that in a DAG with sources and sinks ordered in a certain way, the number of vertex-disjoint path systems that form a permutation sigma is equal to the product of the number of paths for each i to sigma(i), but only if the DAG has a certain structure that allows those paths to be vertex-disjoint. But that's not necessarily true. So perhaps the problem reduces to a matrix where M[i][j] is the number of paths from source i to sink j, and the determinant of this matrix automatically accounts for the vertex-disjointness. But why?

Wait, perhaps when the sources and sinks are ordered in a certain way, and the paths are chosen such that the matrix M's entries count the number of paths from source i to sink j, then the determinant gives exactly the sum over all possible permutations sigma of sgn(sigma) multiplied by the number of vertex-disjoint path systems that form sigma. But under what conditions is this true?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classic application of Lindström's lemma, which states that in a DAG where the sources and sinks are split into two ordered sets, the determinant of the matrix whose entries are the number of paths from source i to sink j equals the number of families of vertex-disjoint paths from the sources to the sinks, each family forming a permutation, multiplied by the sign of the permutation. Oh! So that's the key. Lindström's lemma says exactly that. So the determinant of the path matrix M is exactly the sum over all permutations sigma of the number of vertex-disjoint path systems that correspond to sigma multiplied by the sign of sigma. Which is exactly what the problem is asking for.

So, the problem reduces to building such a matrix M where M[i][j] is the number of paths from the i-th source to the j-th sink, and then computing the determinant of M modulo p.

If this is the case, then the solution is to compute the determinant of this matrix. Therefore, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Find all sources and sinks in the graph.
2. Sort the sources in increasing order of vertex number.
3. Sort the sinks in increasing order of vertex number.
4. Ensure that the number of sources equals the number of sinks (which is guaranteed by the problem statement).
5. For each pair (source i, sink j), compute the number of paths from source i to sink j.
6. Build a matrix M of size k x k, where M[i][j] is the number of paths from i-th source to j-th sink.
7. Compute the determinant of M modulo p. The result is the answer.

So the problem is to compute the determinant of this matrix. The main challenges are:

- Identifying sources and sinks.
- Computing the number of paths from each source to each sink efficiently, given that n can be up to 600, which leads to k up to 600 (since each source and sink is a vertex). So for each of the k sources, we need to compute the number of paths to each of the k sinks. With n=600, and m up to 1e5, how do we compute this efficiently?

Let's think about the path counts. Since the graph is a DAG, for each source u, we can perform a topological sort and compute the number of paths from u to each node. But since there are multiple sources, and we need to compute paths from each source to each sink, we can process each source in a topological order and compute the path counts.

But the graph is fixed. So, for each source u, we can compute the number of paths from u to every node v. Then, for each sink (sorted), we can check the path counts from the sources.

So the steps are:

For each source u in the sorted list of sources:
   Initialize a count array dp, where dp[v] is the number of paths from u to v.
   dp[u] = 1 (the path of zero edges? Or the path of length zero? Wait, the problem counts paths as sequences of edges. So the initial path count for u is 1 (the empty path?), but according to standard definitions, the number of paths from u to v is the sum over all edges from u to w of the number of paths from w to v. So for u itself, the number of paths from u to u is 1 (the trivial path with no edges). But in the problem's context, perhaps paths are required to have at least one edge? Or maybe the problem counts all possible paths, including those of length zero (i.e., the same node). Because in the first sample, the answer is 1, which is the determinant of the identity matrix. For example, in the first sample, the sources are 1 and 2. The sinks are 3 and 4. The paths are 1->3 (counted once) and 2->4 (counted once). So each path is of length 1. So in the matrix M, the entries are 1 for (1,1) and (2,2), and 0 elsewhere, leading to determinant 1.

But what about if a source is also a sink? For example, if a node has no incoming or outgoing edges, then it's both a source and a sink. So the path from that node to itself is a zero-length path. So the count would include that.

Therefore, for each source u, the number of paths from u to v is the sum of all paths that start at u and end at v, following the edges in the DAG. The empty path (only when u = v) is considered here.

So the approach is to, for each source u, compute the number of paths from u to each sink v. Then, arrange these numbers into the matrix M[i][j], where i is the index of the source in the sorted list of sources, and j is the index of the sink in the sorted list of sinks. The determinant of this matrix is the answer.

Now, the problem is to compute this matrix and then compute its determinant modulo p.

So the first step is to find the sources and sinks. Let's see:

Sources are nodes with in-degree zero. Sinks are nodes with out-degree zero.

So to compute sources and sinks:

Compute in-degree and out-degree for each node. Nodes with in-degree zero are sources, nodes with out-degree zero are sinks. Then, sort them in increasing order.

Once the sources and sinks are sorted, for each source in the sorted list, compute the number of paths to each sink in the sorted list.

How to compute the number of paths from u to v?

The graph is a DAG. So for each u, we can perform a topological order processing and compute the number of paths from u to all nodes.

But since the graph is a DAG, we can process each node in topological order. For each node u, we can compute the number of paths from u to each v by traversing the graph in reverse topological order.

Wait, the standard way to compute the number of paths from u to all nodes is:

Initialize a dp array where dp[v] is the number of paths from u to v. Set dp[u] = 1. Then, for each node in topological order, for each neighbor w of v (assuming edges are v → w?), wait no. The topological order is such that all ancestors of a node are processed before the node. So for the number of paths, when processing node v in topological order, all nodes reachable from v must have been processed. Wait, no. For example, if the edges are u → a → b → c, then topological order is u, a, b, c. The number of paths from u to a is 1 (u→a), to b is 1 (u→a→b), etc. So to compute the number of paths from u, we process nodes in topological order, and for each outgoing edge from a node v, we add the number of paths to v to each of its neighbors.

Wait, the standard approach is:

For each node u, to compute the number of paths from u to all other nodes:

1. Initialize a dp array with dp[u] = 1, others 0.
2. Process the nodes in topological order (since the graph is a DAG).
3. For each node v in topological order, for each outgoing edge v → w, add dp[v] to dp[w].
   Because any path from u to w can be extended via v → w (if v is processed first and already has paths from u).

Wait, but the topological order is such that for any edge v → w, v comes before w. So when processing v, you can immediately propagate the paths from u to v to all w's. Then, when you process w, any paths to w would have already been accumulated.

Wait, but the problem is that the paths are from u to all nodes. So for each u, you need to perform this process once. However, when n is 600, and k is up to 600, this would be O(k * (n + m)) which is 600 * (600 + 1e5) = 6e7, which might be acceptable.

But considering that m can be up to 1e5, and for each u, processing all edges, this is O(k * m) = 600 * 1e5 = 6e7 operations, which should be manageable within the time constraints.

But perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, for each node, compute the number of paths from all sources to all nodes. But how? Well, the standard approach is per-source.

So for each source u, we need to compute the number of paths from u to each sink.

So, for each u in the sorted sources list, perform a topological sort of the DAG, then compute the number of paths from u to each node.

Once that's done, for each sink v in the sorted sinks list, take the value of dp[v] for that u and v.

But topological sort can be done once for the entire graph, and then for each source u, process the nodes in topological order and compute the paths.

Yes. Because the graph is the same for all sources, the topological order is fixed. So first, compute a topological order of all nodes. Then, for each source u, compute the number of paths from u to all nodes by processing the nodes in topological order.

Wait, but the topological order is such that all ancestors of a node come before it. So for processing the number of paths from u, the topological order is sufficient.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the in-degree and out-degree for all nodes to find sources and sinks.
2. Sort the sources in increasing order. Same for the sinks.
3. Compute a topological order of the entire graph. Since the graph is a DAG, this is possible.
4. For each source u in the sorted sources list:
   a. Initialize a dp array where dp[u] = 1, others are 0.
   b. For each node v in topological order starting from u's position (or wait, no—the topological order may have u somewhere in the middle. So process all nodes in topological order, and for each node v in the order, for each outgoing edge v → w, add dp[v] to dp[w].
   c. Wait, no. The standard approach is to process the nodes in topological order, and for each node v in the order, for each neighbor w (i.e., edges from v to w), add dp[v] to dp[w]. Because once v is processed, all paths to v have been accounted for, and adding to w's count captures all paths that go through v → w.

But for a given source u, the initial dp[u] is 1, and then processing the nodes in topological order, starting from u.

But the topological order may not start with u. For example, if u is the first node in the topological order, then processing is straightforward. But if u is in the middle, how do we handle that?

Wait, no. The topological order is a linear ordering where all dependencies come before. For any node u, all nodes that can reach u must come before u in the topological order. Wait, no. The topological order is such that for any edge v → w, v comes before w. So, if u has edges to other nodes, then in the topological order, u comes before those nodes. So processing nodes in topological order ensures that when we process a node v, all nodes that can reach v have been processed. But for the paths starting at u, we need to start from u and process nodes after u in the topological order.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is correct. Let me think:

Suppose we have a DAG with topological order v1, v2, ..., vn. For a source u (which is one of the nodes in the order), the number of paths from u to any node can be computed by initializing dp[u] = 1, and then for each node in the topological order starting from u, for each outgoing edge of the node, add dp[v] to dp[w]. Because once we process v in topological order, all possible paths to v have been accounted for, so any paths from u to w via v can be added by considering v's edges.

But the problem is that if a node comes before u in the topological order, then when processing that node, it's possible that u has not been processed yet, so their contribution to the paths from u would not be considered. But for the paths starting at u, the initial dp is 0 for all nodes except u. So, for nodes that come before u in the topological order, their dp values would remain 0, as they can't be part of any path starting from u. So processing all nodes in topological order for each source u is correct, because any node that comes before u in the topological order can't be part of a path from u, so their contributions are zero. Only nodes after u (in topological order) can be part of paths starting from u.

Wait, no. For example, if there is a node v that comes before u in the topological order, then there can't be a path from u to v, since that would form a cycle (as topological order implies v comes before u, which would require u to come before v if there is a path from u to v, which is impossible in a DAG). So nodes before u in the topological order are not reachable from u. Therefore, when processing a topological order for the graph, when you process the nodes in order, the nodes before u can be skipped in the processing for the paths from u, but since their dp values are zero, adding their outgoing edges' contributions would not affect anything.

Therefore, the correct approach is to process all nodes in topological order, for each source u. Because for nodes before u in the topological order, their dp values are zero, and processing their outgoing edges will add nothing. For nodes after u, their dp values are processed normally.

So the steps for each source u are:

Initialize a dp array of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n) with all zeros. Set dp[u] = 1.

Process each node v in the topological order:

   For each outgoing edge v → w in the adjacency list of v:

      dp[w] = (dp[w] + dp[v]) % p (or, since the count can be very large, but modulo p is needed at the end, perhaps we can compute modulo p here. But since the problem's answer is the determinant modulo p, perhaps we can compute all path counts modulo p. However, if p is larger than the maximum possible number of paths (which can be up to 2^m, which is way larger than p in some cases), then we need to compute the path counts modulo p. Because the determinant will be taken modulo p.

But since the determinant can be very large (even if each entry is mod p), we need to compute the determinant modulo p. However, the problem states that the answer is the sum modulo p. So it's sufficient to compute each M[i][j] modulo p, then compute the determinant modulo p.

But wait, the determinant is the sum over all permutations of sgn(sigma) * product(M[i][sigma(i)]), which can be a very large number, but modulo p. So if we compute each M[i][j] modulo p, and then compute the determinant modulo p, that's correct.

Therefore, during the path count computation, for each source u, the number of paths from u to each sink can be computed modulo p. This is important, because the number of paths could be exponential, which would be impossible to store exactly. So modulo p is necessary.

So, during the DP for each source u, we compute the path counts modulo p.

Therefore, the steps are:

For each source u:

   Initialize dp as 0, except dp[u] = 1.

   For each node v in topological order:

      For each edge v → w:

          dp[w] += dp[v]

          dp[w] %= p

   Then, for each sink j in the sorted list, record dp[j] mod p as M[i][j], where i is the index of u in the sorted sources list.

But how to compute the topological order once and use it for all sources?

Yes. Compute the topological order once. Then, for each source u, process the nodes in this order, updating the dp array.

So now, the algorithm steps are:

1. Read the graph, compute in-degree and out-degree for each node.

2. Find all sources (in-degree 0) and sort them in increasing order.

3. Find all sinks (out-degree 0) and sort them in increasing order.

4. Compute a topological order of the entire graph.

5. For each source u in the sorted sources list:

   a. Initialize a dp array with dp[u] = 1 mod p.

   b. For each node v in topological order:

      i. For each neighbor w of v (edges from v to w):

          dp[w] = (dp[w] + dp[v]) % p

   c. For each sink j in the sorted sinks list, store dp[j] mod p as M[i][j], where i is the index of u in the sources list.

6. Compute the determinant of matrix M modulo p.

7. Output the determinant mod p (handling negative values by adding p if necessary).

Now, the main computational challenges are:

- The topological sort: can be done via Kahn's algorithm in O(n + m) time.

- For each source, processing the topological order and edges, which is O(k * (n + m)) time. Since k can be up to 600, and n is 600, m is 1e5, this is 600 * 1e5 = 6e7 operations. Which should be manageable within 3 seconds.

- The determinant computation for a k x k matrix. The standard Gaussian elimination approach for determinant modulo a prime is O(k^3), which for k=600 is 600^3 = 2.16e8 operations. That's acceptable for Python, but may require optimized code.

But wait, Python's speed for loops is slower than C++. For k=600, 600^3 is 2.16e8 operations, which in Python could take around 3 seconds (since each step is a Python loop iteration). But maybe we can optimize the Gaussian elimination.

So, the steps are manageable.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, sources and sinks:

Compute in_degree and out_degree:

Initialize in_degree and out_degree as dictionaries or lists.

For each edge a -> b:

   out_degree[a] += 1

   in_degree[b] += 1

Then, sources are all nodes with in_degree == 0.

Sinks are all nodes with out_degree == 0.

Sort the sources and sinks in increasing order.

Topological sort:

We can perform Kahn's algorithm to get the topological order.

Initialize a queue with all nodes of in_degree 0.

But perhaps we can process the nodes in such a way. Alternatively, use DFS-based topological sort.

But Kahn's algorithm is straightforward.

Once we have the topological order, proceed.

For each source in the sorted sources list:

   Initialize a dp array of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n) as 0.

   dp[u] = 1 mod p.

   For each v in topological_order:

      for each w in adj[v]:

          dp[w] = (dp[w] + dp[v]) % p

   Then, for each sink in the sorted sinks list, record dp[sink] in the matrix.

Once the matrix is built, compute the determinant modulo p.

Now, the determinant computation.

The standard approach for determinant modulo a prime is Gaussian elimination, converting the matrix into upper triangular form, then multiplying the diagonal elements. The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements, multiplied by the sign based on the number of row swaps (even or odd).

But since the modulus p is a prime, and we can have division (using modular inverses), Gaussian elimination works.

But when the modulus is not 2, and p is a prime, the Gaussian elimination algorithm can proceed by finding the pivot, swap rows if necessary, multiply the pivot row by the inverse of the leading coefficient to make it 1, then eliminate the leading coefficients in the other rows.

However, in our case, since the modulus p can be any prime (even 2), and the determinant is required modulo p, we can perform the Gaussian elimination as follows:

For each column:

   Find the first row in current rows with a non-zero entry in this column. If none, determinant is 0.

   Swap this row with the current pivot row.

   For all rows below the pivot row:

      factor = (row[col] * inverse(pivot_row[col])) % p

      Subtract factor * pivot_row from this row.

But wait, in modular arithmetic, the steps are similar to standard Gaussian elimination. However, since p is prime, every non-zero element has an inverse.

Alternatively, for each pivot, we can find a row with a non-zero entry in the current column, then use that as the pivot. Then, for each row below or above (depending on upper or lower triangular), eliminate the entries in that column by row operations.

The number of row swaps affects the sign of the determinant. For the determinant, the sign is (-1)^(number of swaps). So during the process, we track the number of row swaps.

Finally, after converting the matrix into an upper triangular form, the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries multiplied by (-1)^swaps, modulo p.

So the steps for determinant calculation:

Initialize the determinant as 1.

For each i from 0 to k-1 (columns):

   Find a row in i...k-1 where M[row][i] != 0 mod p.

   If none, determinant is 0.

   If row != i, swap rows, determinant *= -1.

   determinant = (determinant * M[i][i]) mod p.

   For row in i+1 to k-1:

      factor = M[row][i] * inverse(M[i][i]) mod p.

      For col in i to k-1:

          M[row][col] = (M[row][col] - factor * M[i][col]) mod p.

Wait, but this approach doesn't create an upper triangular matrix directly. Alternatively, perhaps the code for Gaussian elimination for determinant can be structured as follows:

Initialize sign = 1.

For each step i (0-based) from 0 to k-1:

   Find the pivot row (the first row in i...k-1 where M[row][i] is not zero modulo p).

   If no pivot found, return 0.

   If pivot_row != i:

       swap M[i] and M[pivot_row], sign *= -1.

   Multiply the determinant by M[i][i], and multiply sign accordingly.

   For rows j > i:

       factor = M[j][i] * inverse(M[i][i]) mod p.

       for columns l from i to k-1:

           M[j][l] = (M[j][l] - factor * M[i][l]) mod p.

But wait, this isn't the full upper triangular approach. Alternatively, during each iteration, the rows below i are processed to eliminate their i-th column entries. Then, after processing all columns, the matrix is upper triangular, and the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries multiplied by the sign.

But perhaps the code can be optimized by stopping after processing each column. For example, in code:

mod = p

det = 1

n = k

for i in range(n):

    pivot = -1

    for j in range(i, n):

        if matrix[j][i] % mod != 0:

            pivot = j

            break

    if pivot == -1:

        print(0)

        exit()

    if pivot != i:

        matrix[i], matrix[pivot] = matrix[pivot], matrix[i]

        det = (-det) % mod

    inv = pow(matrix[i][i], mod-2, mod)

    det = (det * matrix[i][i]) % mod

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        factor = (matrix[j][i] * inv) % mod

        for k_col in range(i, n):

            matrix[j][k_col] = (matrix[j][k_col] - factor * matrix[i][k_col]) % mod

return det * sign ?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, after each pivot step, the leading entry is matrix[i][i], and the rows below are reduced. The determinant is the product of the pivots, multiplied by the sign from row swaps.

Yes, this approach works. So during each step i:

- Find pivot in column i, starting at row i.

- Swap with current row if necessary.

- Compute the determinant as det * matrix[i][i], then multiply the sign.

- For each row below, eliminate the entry in column i by subtracting factor * row i from row j.

But since after this, the matrix becomes upper triangular, the product of the diagonal entries is the determinant, multiplied by the sign from row swaps.

But in the code, since we are working mod p, and the operations are mod p, we need to handle all calculations under modulo p.

So, in the code:

Initialize det = 1.

sign = 1.

For each i from 0 to k-1:

   Find pivot row.

   If no pivot, return 0.

   If pivot != i:

       swap rows, and multiply sign by -1.

   det = (det * matrix[i][i]) % mod.

   Then, for all j > i:

       factor = matrix[j][i] * inverse(matrix[i][i]) mod mod.

       for l from i to k-1:

           matrix[j][l] = (matrix[j][l] - factor * matrix[i][l]) % mod.

But wait, after the pivot, we can compute the factor and eliminate the entries in the column below. But for determinant computation, perhaps we don't need to make the leading coefficient 1, but the code above still works because when you subtract factor * row i from row j, the determinant remains the same. But no, the process of elimination (like Gaussian elimination) does not change the determinant if you perform row operations of adding a multiple of another row. But in this code, after selecting the pivot, the leading entry is matrix[i][i], and the code is reducing the rows below by multiplying the pivot row by a factor and subtracting.

Wait, the code as written will compute the determinant as the product of the pivots, multiplied by the sign from row swaps. But during the process, the elimination steps (adding multiples of the pivot row to lower rows) do not affect the determinant. Because those operations are row additions, which do not change the determinant.

So, the code that computes the product of the pivots (matrix[i][i] after each step) multiplied by the sign from row swaps is correct.

But in this case, the code is not reducing the matrix to upper triangular form. Because for each row j > i, after subtracting factor * row i from row j, the entry matrix[j][i] becomes zero. So after processing column i, all entries below the pivot in column i are zero. So the matrix is upper triangular after processing all columns. The product of the diagonal elements multiplied by the sign gives the determinant.

Therefore, the code should work.

Now, the code steps:

In Python, for the matrix, it's a list of lists. For each row in the matrix, it's a list of integers modulo p.

Implementing Gaussian elimination for determinant:

But for large k (like 600), the code must be optimized. Python's loops can be slow, but we can try to optimize using list comprehensions or precomputing.

Now, let's consider the steps for code:

Read n, m, p.

Read m edges. Build adjacency list.

Compute in_degree and out_degree for each node.

Compute sources as sorted list of nodes with in_degree 0.

Compute sinks as sorted list of nodes with out_degree 0.

k = len(sources). Must be equal to len(sinks). The problem statement says so.

Compute topological order using Kahn's algorithm.

Then, for each source in sources:

   Initialize dp array with 0's, except dp[source] = 1.

   For each node in topological order:

       for each neighbor in adj[v]:

           dp[neighbor] = (dp[neighbor] + dp[v]) % p

   Then, for each sink in sinks, append dp[sink] to the matrix row.

Once the matrix is built (k x k), compute determinant modulo p.

Handle negative determinant by adding p and then mod p.

Now, the code.

First, topological sort.

Implementing Kahn's algorithm:

Initialize in_degree array.

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

in_degree = [0] * (n +1)

out_degree = [0] * (n +1)

for each edge a, b:

   adj[a].append(b)

   in_degree[b] +=1

   out_degree[a] +=1

Then, create a queue of nodes with in_degree zero.

queue = deque()

for node in 1..n:

   if in_degree[node] ==0:

       queue.append(node)

top_order = []

while queue:

   u = queue.popleft()

   top_order.append(u)

   for v in adj[u]:

       in_degree[v] -=1

       if in_degree[v] ==0:

           queue.append(v)

Thus, top_order contains the topological order.

Then, for each source in sources (sorted list), compute the dp.

sources = sorted([u for u in 1..n if in_degree[u] ==0])

sinks = sorted([u for u in 1..n if out_degree[u] ==0])

k = len(sources)

matrix = [[0]*k for _ in range(k)]

for i in range(k):

   u = sources[i]

   dp = [0] * (n+1)

   dp[u] = 1

   for v in top_order:

       current = dp[v]

       if current ==0:

           continue

       for w in adj[v]:

           dp[w] = (dp[w] + current) % p

   for j in range(k):

       sink = sinks[j]

       matrix[i][j] = dp[sink] % p

Then, compute the determinant of matrix modulo p.

Now, the Gaussian elimination code.

Implementing this for the matrix:

def determinant_mod(matrix, mod):

    n = len(matrix)

    det = 1

    sign = 1

    for i in range(n):

        # Find pivot

        pivot = -1

        for j in range(i, n):

            if matrix[j][i] % mod !=0:

                pivot = j

                break

        if pivot == -1:

            return 0

        if pivot != i:

            matrix[i], matrix[pivot] = matrix[pivot], matrix[i]

            sign *= -1

        inv = pow(matrix[i][i], mod-2, mod)

        det = (det * matrix[i][i]) % mod

        for j in range(i+1, n):

            factor = (matrix[j][i] * inv) % mod

            for k_col in range(i, n):

                matrix[j][k_col] = (matrix[j][k_col] - factor * matrix[i][k_col]) % mod

    return (det * sign) % mod

But wait, the code modifies the matrix, and after each step, the rows are modified. Also, the determinant is multiplied by the leading entry (matrix[i][i]) and the sign.

But the code above uses inv = inverse of matrix[i][i], and then factor is matrix[j][i] * inv. Then, subtract factor times row i from row j.

But this step is to make all elements below the pivot in column i zero.

But in Gaussian elimination for determinant calculation, we can avoid dividing, because the determinant is the product of the pivots multiplied by the sign.

However, the code above computes the determinant as the product of the pivots (matrix[i][i] after each step) multiplied by the sign. But during the elimination steps, the rows below are modified by subtracting a multiple of the pivot row. This does not affect the determinant, as those are row operations of adding a multiple of another row, which doesn't change the determinant. However, the pivots are the leading coefficients.

Wait, no. For example, in the standard Gaussian elimination, when we have a pivot a at (i,i), and we multiply a row by a factor, the determinant is multiplied by that factor. But in our code, we are not scaling the pivot row. We are scaling the row j by factor to eliminate the entry in column i.

Wait, no. The code uses inv = inverse of matrix[i][i], which is a mod inverse. Then, factor is matrix[j][i] * inv. Then, for each column in row j, subtract factor * row i's column. This effectively zeros out matrix[j][i], and the other entries are adjusted accordingly.

But this operation is equivalent to multiplying row j by 1 (since we're not scaling the pivot row). So, this is a row operation that does not change the determinant. So the determinant remains the product of the pivots (the original matrix[i][i] after swapping), multiplied by the sign from row swaps.

But in the code, the 'det' is multiplied by matrix[i][i], which is the pivot, but after swapping.

Yes. Because after swapping, the pivot row is in position i, and the code uses matrix[i][i] as the pivot. So the code accumulates the product of the pivots (after swapping) and the sign from row swaps.

So the code should correctly compute the determinant.

But in Python, for large matrices, this code might be slow. But with k up to 600, and Python's speed, it's manageable.

Testing with the first sample:

Sample 1:

4 2 1000003

1 3

2 4

Sources are [1,2], sinks [3,4].

matrix is [[1,0], [0,1]]

determinant is 1*1 - 0*0 =1 mod p.

Sample 2:

4 2 1000003

4 1

3 2

Sources are [3,4], sinks [1,2].

matrix is:

paths from 3 to 1: 0 (since 3 can reach 2, but not 1).

paths from 3 to 2: 1 (3->2).

paths from4 to 1: 1 (4->1).

paths from4 to 2:0.

matrix is [[0,1], [1,0]]

determinant is 0*0 -1*1 =-1 mod p → 1000002.

Sample 3:

4 4 1000003

Edges:

2→1, 2→4, 3→1, 3→4.

Sources are 2 and 3 (in sorted order).

Sinks are 1 and4.

matrix:

paths from 2 to 1: via 2→1. Also via 2→4 → ... no. Because the graph is 2→1, 2→4, 3→1, 3→4.

So for source 2:

dp[2] =1.

Processing topological order.

Assuming topological order is 2,3,1,4.

Processing 2:

neighbors are 1 and4. dp[1] +=1, dp[4] +=1.

Processing 3: initial dp[3] is 0 (since source is 2).

So after processing 3, no changes.

Processing 1:

dp[1] is 1. No edges from 1.

Processing 4: dp[4] is 1. No edges from 4.

So for sinks 1 and4, dp[1] =1, dp[4]=1.

For source 3:

dp[3] =1.

Processing topological order.

Processing 3:

edges to 1 and4. So dp[1] +=1, dp[4] +=1.

Processing other nodes:

say, after 3, next in topological order is 2. dp[2] is 0.

So no changes.

Processing 1: dp[1] is 1. No edges.

Processing4: dp[4] is 1. No edges.

So for source 3, sinks 1 and4 have dp[1] =1, dp[4]=1.

So matrix is:

[ [1, 1], [1,1] ]

determinant is (1*1) - (1*1) =0.

Which matches sample3's output.

So the code should handle these cases.

Now, the code in Python.

But for handling the topological order and the adjacency list, we need to build it correctly.

Now, the code:

Read n, m, p.

Read m edges.

Build the adjacency list.

Compute in_degree and out_degree.

Find sources and sinks, sorted.

Compute topological order.

For each source in sources, compute paths to all nodes.

Then build the matrix.

Compute determinant.

Handle the case where the determinant is negative by adding p and then mod p.

So, the code:

import sys
from collections import deque

def main():
    n, m, p = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        edges[a].append(b)
        in_degree[b] +=1
        out_degree[a] +=1

    # Find sources and sinks
    sources = sorted([u for u in range(1, n+1) if in_degree[u] ==0])

        print(0)

This code should handle all the test cases.

But let's test sample 2:

Sample 2 input:

4 2 1000003

4 1

3 2

Sources are 3,4 (sorted), sinks are 1,2 (sorted).

matrix[0][0] is the number of paths from 3 to 1. There are none. So 0.

matrix[0][1] is paths from 3 to 2: 1 (direct edge).

matrix[1][0] is paths from4 to 1: 1 (direct edge).

matrix[1][1] is paths from4 to 2: 0.

matrix is [[0,1], [1,0]]

determinant is 0*0 -1*1 = -1 mod 1e6+3 is 1000002.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 5:

input:

5 2 1000003

5 1

3 4.

Sources are nodes with in_degree 0.

Nodes 1: in_degree depends on edges. Edge 5→1: in_degree[1] is 1.

Edge 3→4: in_degree[4] is 1.

So sources are nodes with in_degree 0. Check each node:

node 2: in_degree is 0.

node 3: in_degree is 0.

node 5: in_degree is 0.

So sources are 2,3,5. Sorted: 2,3,5.

Sinks are nodes with out_degree 0.

Nodes 1: out_degree 0 (no edges from 1).

node 4: out_degree 0 (no edges from 4).

node 5: edge 5→1, so out_degree is 1. So not a sink.

node 2: out_degree 0.

So sinks are 1,2,4. Sorted: 1,2,4.

So k=3.

The matrix for sources 2,3,5 to sinks 1,2,4.

For source 2:

Edges: none. So paths from 2 are only itself. Sinks are 1,2,4.

dp[2] =1.

Other nodes: 2 has no outgoing edges. So dp[1] =0, dp[2] =1, dp[4]=0.

matrix[0][0] is 0 (source 2 to sink 1).

matrix[0][1] is 1 (source 2 to sink 2).

matrix[0][2] is 0.

For source 3:

Edges: 3→4. So paths from3 to 4 is 1.

Other paths: 3 can reach 4, but sinks are 1,2,4.

So dp[3] =1.

After processing topological order (assuming topological order is 5,3,4, 2,1? Not sure, but let's see):

Source is 3.

dp[3] =1.

Process edges of 3: 3→4. dp[4] +=1.

Other nodes have no paths from 3.

So for sinks 1,2,4: dp[1]=0, dp[2]=0, dp[4]=1.

matrix[1][0] =0, [1][1] =0, [1][2] =1.

For source 5:

Edges:5→1.

dp[5] =1.

Process edges of5:5→1. dp[1] +=1.

So for sinks 1,2,4: dp[1]=1, others 0.

matrix[2][0] =1, [2][1] =0, [2][2] =0.

So matrix is:

Row 0 (source 2): [0, 1, 0]

Row 1 (source3): [0, 0, 1]

Row 2 (source5): [1, 0, 0]

The determinant is:

The permutation is (1→2, 2→3, 3→1). The permutation is a cycle of length 3, which has 2 inversions (even). So the sign is +1. The product is 1*1*1=1. So determinant is 1*1=1 mod p.

Which matches the sample's output of 1.

The code should correctly compute this.

So the code should handle all test cases.
