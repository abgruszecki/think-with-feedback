Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem requires finding the minimal number of operations to flip certain panels to reach a target state. The initial state is all OFF, and the target has certain panels ON. Each operation uses a selected a_i from the given list, choosing a consecutive sequence of a_i panels to flip.

First, let's understand the problem. The key is to model how each operation affects the panel states. Since each flip toggles the state, this feels like a problem that can be modeled with binary states and bitmask operations. But wait, n can be up to 10,000, which is way too big for a bitmask approach. So that's not feasible here.

Alternative approach: think of the problem as a BFS on the possible states. But with n up to 10,000, the state space is 2^10000, which is impossible. So BFS is definitely out of the question. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but the target state has exactly k panels ON. The problem says that the required state has exactly x1, x2,...xk ON. So perhaps the problem can be transformed into a sequence of operations that flip certain intervals such that the combined effect is exactly those k panels being flipped from the initial state.

Wait, the initial state is all OFF, and the target is exactly the x's being ON, others OFF. Each operation flips a consecutive sequence of a_i panels. So each operation is a range flip. So the problem is to find a minimal sequence of such ranges such that their combined flips result in exactly the target bits being ON.

But how can we model this efficiently?

Hmm, since each flip is a range toggle, maybe we can model the problem as a series of transitions between difference sets of ranges. But even that seems challenging.

Another thought: when you flip a range, it's equivalent to toggling the state of all bits in that range. So the order of operations matters only in that overlapping flips can cancel each other out. For example, flipping a range twice is the same as not flipping it at all.

This suggests that each operation is applied 0 or 1 times. But that's only true if each operation can be applied any number of times. However, the problem allows using the same a_i as many times as needed. So perhaps we can model the problem as choosing a set of ranges (each of some length a_i) such that their combined effect equals the target.

But even that seems tricky. Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem of covering the necessary flips with the minimal number of intervals. Let's model the required flips. The initial state is all OFF, and the target is certain positions ON. So each of the x's must be flipped an odd number of times, and all others an even number (including zero).

So the problem reduces to covering the x positions with ranges (of lengths from the given a_i list) such that each x is covered an odd number of times and others even. The minimal number of such ranges.

But how to model this? The problem is similar to a set cover problem, but with parity constraints, which is NP-hard. However, the constraints here might allow for a dynamic programming approach, given that k (the number of required ON bits) is up to 10, which is small.

Wait, the constraints mention that k is up to 10. That's a key point. So perhaps the solution can be based on the positions of the x's. Let's think about the differences between the x's. Maybe we can model the problem by looking at the required flips between consecutive x's.

Alternatively, consider that each flip operation affects a range. The key is to find a way to represent the required flips as a set of ranges such that their combined effect is exactly the target.

Another idea: since the target is a set of points, the problem can be modeled as intervals that start and end at certain positions. For example, the flip of a range [s, e] will toggle the state of all points in that range. So, each flip can be represented by its start and end. But considering all possible ranges of lengths a_i is possible, but how?

Wait, for each a in the given a_i list, the possible ranges are those of length exactly a. So for each a, a flip can be any consecutive a panels, i.e., starting at position s, ending at s+a-1, where s can range from 1 to n - a + 1.

But enumerating all possible ranges for all a_i's is impossible for large n. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but maybe the problem can be modeled using the differences between the x's. Let's think of the required flip as a set of transitions: the x's must be flipped an odd number of times, and the others even. So the problem is similar to the classic light flipping puzzles, where each operation affects a range, and we need to find the minimal steps to reach the desired state.

In such puzzles, the approach is to model the problem as a system of equations. For example, each flip can be represented by its effect on the bits. However, with n up to 10,000, that's not feasible.

But perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph problem where each node represents the current state, and edges represent flipping a certain a_i range. But again, the state space is too big.

Wait, but the target state is a specific set of x's. Let's consider the problem as the need to flip exactly those x's. So the problem is to find a sequence of ranges such that each x is in an odd number of ranges, and each non-x is in an even number.

Another angle: each flip operation is a range, which can be represented as a binary vector (1 for flipped, 0 otherwise). The problem is to find a combination of these vectors (mod 2) that equals the target vector (1 at x's, 0 elsewhere). The minimal number of vectors (operations) to sum to this target.

This is the set cover problem in linear algebra over GF(2), and finding the minimal number of vectors to form a certain sum. However, solving this for n=10000 is impossible with standard methods. But perhaps the small k (number of 1's in the target) allows some optimizations.

Alternatively, note that the x's are given in order. Let's arrange them in order: x_1, x_2, ..., x_k. The problem is to cover these x's with intervals such that each x is covered an odd number of times, and others even. The minimal number of intervals.

Hmm, maybe we can model this as a graph where the nodes represent the parity state between consecutive x's. Let's see.

Let's consider the required coverage. For the x's, each must be flipped an odd number of times. The regions between them must be covered even times. Wait, but the non-x positions must have even coverage. So the flip ranges must start and end in such a way that the x's are covered, and the other parts are covered even times.

Alternatively, the problem can be thought of as a sequence of flip operations that start and end at certain positions. Each flip can be thought of as a toggle at the start and end positions. For example, flipping a range [a, b] can be represented as toggling the state at a and b+1. This is similar to the line sweep technique used in some range update problems.

Wait, that's an interesting idea. Let's think of the flip operation as a difference array. Since flipping a range [s, e] is equivalent to flipping all positions from s to e. The effect on the difference array would be toggling the parity at s and e+1. Then, the overall parity changes would be the XOR of all these toggles.

Wait, here's the idea. Let's model the problem using a difference array. The difference array D is such that D[i] represents the number of flips (mod 2) that affect position i. Then, the actual number of flips for position i is the prefix sum of D up to i. But since we are working modulo 2, this can be represented as the XOR of the prefix sum.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Let's model the flipping process as a binary array, where each position i is flipped D[i] times. Then, the actual flip count for position i is the sum of D[1..i], mod 2. Because each flip that starts at s <= i and ends at e >= i would contribute 1 to the sum. So, if we have a difference array D, where each flip [s, e] adds 1 to D[s] and subtracts 1 from D[e+1], then the actual number of flips for position i is the prefix sum up to i modulo 2. But since we are working in mod 2, the subtraction is equivalent to adding 1. So, for a flip [s, e], the difference array D is modified by D[s] ^= 1 and D[e+1] ^= 1 (if e+1 <=n).

But the target is that the prefix sum up to i (mod 2) is 1 for x's and 0 otherwise. So, the difference array must be such that the prefix sum up to x_1 is 1, up to x_2 is 1, etc., but between x's, the prefix sum must be 0.

Wait, perhaps this can be modeled as follows. The target is that the prefix sum (mod 2) at each x_j is 1, and 0 elsewhere. So the difference array D must be such that the XOR of the prefix sum at each x_j is 1, and 0 elsewhere.

Alternatively, the problem can be transformed into a difference array where D[1] is the first x_1's parity, D[x_1 + 1] is the parity at x_1+1, etc. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, let's think again. Let's model the flipping as a difference array approach. For each flip of range [s, e], we can represent it as two events: toggle at s and toggle at e+1. Then, the actual number of flips for a position i is the number of toggles at s <= i minus the number at e+1 <= i, summed mod 2. Wait, no. The difference array approach is used for range updates. Each flip [s, e] can be represented by adding 1 to D[s] and subtracting 1 from D[e+1], but when working modulo 2, subtraction is addition. So, for a flip [s, e], the difference array D is toggled at s and e+1 (if e+1 <=n).

But the actual flip count for position i is the prefix sum of D up to i mod 2. Because:

sum_{j=1 to i} D[j] mod 2 = (sum of D[j] for j=1 to i) mod 2.

Each flip [s, e] contributes to D[s] and D[e+1]. So for the prefix sum up to i, it's equivalent to the number of flips that started before or at i and ended after i. Because the flip [s, e] would contribute 1 to all positions from s to e. But the prefix sum up to i would include the 1 in D[s] if s <=i, but not the -1 (or +1) in D[e+1] if e+1 <=i. Wait, maybe this approach isn't the right way to model it.

Alternatively, let's model the flipping operations as toggling the state. Each flip of [s, e] toggles all positions from s to e. The final state must be exactly the x positions ON (toggled once), others OFF (toggled zero times). So the total number of times each position is toggled must be even for non-x positions and odd for x positions.

But how to model the minimal number of flips to achieve this.

Another idea: the required flips can be represented as a sequence of intervals such that the x positions are covered an odd number of times, and others even. The problem is to find the minimal number of intervals (of allowed lengths) that achieve this.

The allowed interval lengths are the a_i's. So, for each flip, we can choose any a from the list and any starting position s where s + a -1 <=n.

The key is to model this as a covering problem with parity constraints.

But with n up to 1e4 and a_i up to 1e2, it's challenging.

But since the number of x's is small (k up to 10), maybe we can model the problem in terms of the x's and their positions.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of flips required would involve flipping around the x's. For example, each flip could start or end at a x_j, or between x's.

Let's think of the x's as positions that must be covered an odd number of times. The other positions must be covered even times.

Each flip is a consecutive range. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into covering the x's with intervals such that each x is in an odd number of intervals, and all other positions are in an even number.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, let's model the problem as follows. Each flip is a range [s, e] of length a_i. The XOR (parity) of the sum of intervals covering each x_j must be 1. For non-x positions, it must be 0.

But how to model this with minimal intervals.

Another approach: since the x's are in sorted order, maybe the minimal solution can be constructed by considering the required flips between consecutive x's. Let's imagine that between x_i and x_{i+1}, the flips must start and end in such a way that the overlapping regions are handled properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents the current position in the x array, and the edges represent flipping a certain a_i. But this is vague.

Wait, here's a possible approach inspired by the BFS idea. The key is that the x's are the only positions that need to be covered an odd number of times. The rest can be covered even times, which could be zero. So, the problem can be represented as a binary vector of size k, where each element is 1 if the x_j has been flipped an odd number of times. However, since each flip can affect multiple x's, this may not capture the entire state.

But given that k is up to 10, maybe a BFS over the possible states of the x's is feasible. Wait, but each flip can affect any subset of x's, so the state transitions would be complex. For example, a flip that covers x_3 and x_4 would toggle their parity. So the state would be a bitmask of size k, indicating which x's are flipped an odd number of times. The goal is to reach a state where all bits are 1 (since each x needs to be flipped once). However, this ignores the non-x positions, which must not be flipped. But how?

Because flipping a range that includes non-x positions could toggle their parity, which must remain even (i.e., zero). So, this approach might not work because it doesn't account for the parity of the non-x positions. However, perhaps the parity of non-x positions can be handled automatically.

Wait, maybe the problem can be transformed by considering the required changes in the parity of the x's and ignoring the non-x's. But this is only possible if the flips can be arranged such that the non-x's are flipped even number of times. But this isn't necessarily the case. So this approach could lead to invalid solutions where some non-x positions are flipped an odd number of times.

Hmm. So perhaps the BFS approach on the x's is not sufficient. We need a way to model the flips such that non-x positions are covered even times.

This seems challenging.

Alternative idea: since each flip is a consecutive range, the problem can be viewed as requiring that the sum of the intervals (mod 2) is exactly the set of x's. So, the intervals must form a collection where each x is covered an odd number of times and others even. But how to model this.

Wait, here's another observation. Suppose we have a flip that starts at s and ends at e. To cover some x's, but also non-x's. To avoid affecting the non-x's, the flip must start and end exactly at x's. Because any flip that starts before a x and ends after it would cover the x, but also some non-x's. So, perhaps the minimal solution would involve flips that start and end at x's.

But how to model this. Let's think of the x's as points, and the required flips as covering them with intervals that start and end at certain x's. For example, if a flip starts at x_i and ends at x_j, then all x's between x_i and x_j would be flipped. So, the problem reduces to selecting a set of intervals (with lengths in the a_i list) that start and end at x's, such that each x is covered an odd number of times.

But how can we model this? For example, the allowed intervals are those of length a, which may not exactly start and end at x's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where the minimal number of intervals is determined by the required coverage of the x's, considering the possible gaps between them.

Wait, let's arrange the x's in order. Let's also add a dummy x_0 at position 0 and x_{k+1} at position n+1 for easier processing. The required positions are x_1 to x_k. Now, the gaps between the x's are:

x_0 (0) to x_1 (original x_1)

x_1 to x_2

...

x_k to x_{k+1} (n+1)

For each gap, any flip that starts in one gap and ends in another could cover multiple x's and affect non-x positions. But since non-x positions must not be flipped, such flips would need to start and end exactly at x's to avoid covering non-x's. Otherwise, they would flip non-x positions, which would require additional flips to cancel those out.

But this is only possible if the a_i's can form intervals that exactly start and end at x's. However, the a_i's can be arbitrary lengths. So this approach may not be feasible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the required flip ranges. Each flip is a range of a_i consecutive panels, and the minimal number of such ranges to cover exactly the x's an odd number of times and others even.

Another idea: since the x's are in sorted order, maybe the solution can be built by considering the necessary steps between consecutive x's. For example, if the x's are contiguous, then a single flip of length equal to the span could work. But in the first example, the x's are 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9, and two flips are used: 1-3 and 5-9 (the second flip is length 5, covering 5-9). So the gaps between the x's (like between 3 and 5) are covered by the flips. But in that case, the flip from 5-9 starts at 5 (an x) and ends at 9 (an x), covering all x's in between. However, this leaves some non-x's (like position 4) uncovered.

Wait, but in the first example, the first flip covers 1-3 (all x's) and the second covers 5-9 (all x's). So between 3 and 5, there's a non-x (position 4) which is flipped once by the second flip. But since it's not an x, that would make its parity 1, which is invalid. Wait, but the sample input's target is x's 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. So position 4 is OFF. How does this work?

Ah, because the second flip is of length 5. So the first flip is 1-3: flips positions 1,2,3 (all x's). The second flip is 5-9 (positions 5 to 9 inclusive), which are x's. But what about position 4? The initial state is all OFF. The first flip turns 1-3 to ON. The second flip turns 5-9 to ON. So the final state is 1-3 and 5-9 ON. But according to the sample input, that's exactly the target. So position 4 is OFF. So how did the second flip not affect position 4? Because the second flip starts at 5. So the range is 5-9 (length 5: 5,6,7,8,9). So position 4 is not flipped again. So, no problem.

But how to model this in general. Because in this case, the flips are chosen such that their ranges exactly cover the x's. But in the case where x's are not contiguous, this might not be possible. For example, if there's a gap between x's, but no a_i can fit the required range.

Hmm. So perhaps the solution is to model the problem by considering the required intervals that cover the x's, and using BFS to find the minimal number of steps to cover all x's with their ranges, ensuring that each x is covered an odd number of times and others even.

But how to model this.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the line sweep technique. Let's model the required flip ranges as a series of events that toggle the parity of the x's and possibly some non-x's.

But again, the problem is how to avoid flipping non-x's an odd number of times.

This seems tricky.

Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node represents the current state of the x's. Since there are k x's, each can be in a state of even or odd flips. So the total number of possible states is 2^k. For k up to 10, this is 1024, which is manageable.

But how to model transitions between states. Each transition corresponds to selecting a flip of a certain a_i and a starting position s. However, since a_i can be up to n, there are O(n*l) possible transitions for each state, which is 1e4 * 1e2 = 1e6. Multiplying by 1e3 (number of states) gives 1e9 operations, which is way too much.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: precompute all possible ranges that can be formed using the given a_i's, and then model the problem as a BFS where each state is the set of x's covered an odd number of times. But again, even this approach is not feasible due to the number of possible ranges.

Wait, but perhaps the minimal number of steps is small. For example, in the sample input, it's 2 steps. So BFS can be feasible if the steps are limited. But in the worst case, the number of steps could be up to k, which is 10, leading to a BFS of depth 10. Each step would have a certain number of possible transitions, but even this could be manageable.

Alternatively, we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is a bitmask of the x's that have been flipped an odd number of times. The goal is to reach the all-ones bitmask. Each move is flipping a certain a_i's range, which would toggle some subset of the x's. The minimal number of moves is the answer.

But how to represent the transitions. For each possible a in the a_i list, and for each possible starting position s, compute the subset of x's that are in the range [s, s+a-1]. Then, each such subset is a mask, and applying that mask to the current state toggles those bits.

But the problem is that for each a, there are O(n) possible ranges (start positions s), leading to O(n*l) possible masks. But n is 1e4 and l is 1e2, which gives 1e6 possible masks. But even for each of the 1e3 states, trying all 1e6 masks is 1e9 operations, which is impossible.

But perhaps we can precompute for each a_i all possible masks that can be generated by ranges of that a_i. Then, for each a_i, collect all unique masks that can be generated. Then, during BFS, we can iterate over each a_i and each possible unique mask for that a_i, and apply the mask to the current state.

But how many unique masks can there be per a_i? For example, for a_i=3, the possible ranges are [1-3], [2-4], ..., [n-2, n]. For each of these ranges, the mask is the subset of x's that are covered by the range. The number of unique masks depends on the x's. Since k is up to 10, the number of possible masks per a_i is up to 2^10=1024. But for a_i=3 and x's spread out, it's possible that each range of a_i=3 covers different subsets. For example, if the x's are spread out, the number of unique masks could be up to (n - a_i + 1) * (possible subsets), but for n=1e4 and a_i=1e4, it's 1.

But considering that for each a_i, the number of unique masks could be up to (n - a_i + 1) but possibly much less, but for l=100 a_i's, this could be manageable.

But even then, for a_i=3 and n=1e4, the number of possible ranges is 1e4 - 3 + 1 = ~1e4. For each of these, we compute the mask (subset of x's in the range). For each a_i, the unique masks are stored. Then, during BFS, for each a_i, we can process all unique masks for that a_i and apply them to the current state.

But even this approach would require, for each a_i, generating all possible masks, which could be O(1e4) per a_i. For l=100 a_i's, this is O(1e6) masks. Then, for each mask, we can generate transitions in the BFS. But with 1e6 masks and 1e3 states, this is 1e9 operations, which is impossible.

Alternative idea: since the target is to have all x's covered once, and the problem is to find the minimal steps, perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each step applies a mask (subset of x's) and transitions to the next state. The masks are precomputed for all possible a_i ranges.

But the key is to precompute all possible masks that can be generated by any a_i range, and then model the BFS with transitions being the application of these masks. This reduces the problem to a BFS over the state space of bitmask masks (1024 possibilities) with transitions being the available masks.

So, the steps would be:

1. Precompute all possible masks (subsets of x's) that can be covered by any a_i range. For example, for each a in a_i, iterate through all possible ranges of length a, and for each range, compute the mask of x's that are in that range. Collect all unique masks across all a_i's.

2. Then, perform BFS starting from the initial state (all 0's, no x's covered) to the target state (all 1's). Each step applies a mask, XORing the current state with the mask. The minimal number of steps to reach the target is the answer.

But this approach is possible because the order of applying the masks doesn't matter (since XOR is commutative), but we need to track the number of steps. However, since the same mask can be applied multiple times, but each application toggles the state, applying the same mask twice cancels out. So, each mask is used at most once in the solution path.

This is similar to the BFS approach used in the "light flipping" puzzles where each move toggles a subset of lights, and we need to find the minimal steps to reach the target.

So, the BFS would have states represented by the current bitmask, and transitions are applying a mask (from the precomputed list) to the current state. Each transition is a step. The BFS finds the minimal steps to reach the target mask.

This approach's feasibility depends on the number of unique masks. If the number of masks is manageable (say up to 1e4), then the BFS would be feasible.

So, the steps are:

1. Precompute all possible masks for all a_i ranges.

For each a in the a_i list:

   For each possible start position s (from 1 to n - a +1):

      Compute the range [s, s + a -1]

      Compute the subset of x's that are within this range. This is the mask.

   Collect all unique masks from all a's and all possible s.

   Also, for each a, we can precompute the masks once and then use them in BFS.

But generating these masks could be time-consuming. For each a, there are O(n) ranges, and for each range, checking each x (k=10) to see if it's in the range.

But for a_i=1e4 and k=10, each check is O(10) operations. For l=100 a_i's, and each a_i with O(1e4) ranges, this is 1e4 * 100 * 10 = 1e7 operations, which is manageable.

So, the code would first generate all possible masks.

Once all masks are generated, the BFS proceeds with the initial state (0) and tries to reach the target (all 1's).

Each step in the BFS applies a mask from the precomputed list, XORs the current state with the mask, and if this new state hasn't been visited before, adds it to the queue with a step count incremented by 1.

If the target is reached, return the step count. If the queue is exhausted, return -1.

But wait, this approach ignores the non-x positions. Because applying a mask (which represents the x's covered by a range) doesn't account for whether the range also covers non-x positions. So, even if the mask covers the x's correctly, the range may flip non-x positions, leading to their parity being incorrect.

This is a problem. Because the solution must ensure that all non-x positions are flipped even times (zero or even). But this approach doesn't account for that.

So, this approach is incorrect. Because it's possible to find a mask that covers the x's correctly, but the actual range may include non-x positions, leading to their parity being flipped. Which would make the solution invalid.

Ah, this is a critical flaw in the previous approach. So, the BFS approach based on x's mask only is insufficient because it doesn't check whether the flips on non-x positions are even.

Thus, the problem requires not only that the x's are flipped an odd number of times but also that all other positions are flipped even times. So, the previous approach is invalid.

This complicates the problem significantly.

So, how to model the problem now. We need to ensure that every non-x position is covered even number of times. The x's must be covered odd number of times. So, the problem is to find a set of intervals such that:

sum_{intervals} [s_i <= x_j <= e_i] mod 2 = 1 for each x_j.

sum_{intervals} [s_i <= p <= e_i] mod 2 = 0 for each p not in x's.

This is a system of equations where each equation corresponds to a position. However, the number of equations is n, which is up to 1e4. So, solving this system directly is impossible.

But the problem requires the minimal number of intervals. So, perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph where each node represents the required parity changes in the x's and the parity of certain other positions. But again, the state space is too large.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this problem by considering the required changes in the difference array. Let's think again about the difference array approach.

Each flip [s, e] toggles the parity of all positions from s to e. The final parity for each x_j is 1, and for non-x_j it's 0.

The difference array D can be modeled such that the sum up to i is the parity of the number of flips covering i. For the x_j's, this sum must be 1. For others, 0.

This sum can be represented as the XOR of the difference array up to i. So, the problem is to find a set of intervals (flips) that, when their difference arrays are XORed together, produce a difference array where the prefix XOR up to x_j is 1 for all x_j and 0 for others.

But how to model this. The difference array for a single flip [s, e] is D[s] ^= 1, D[e+1] ^=1 (if e+1 <=n). The sum up to i for the difference array is the XOR of D[1..i], which represents the parity of the number of flips covering i.

The target is that for each i in x's, the XOR sum up to i is 1, and for others, 0.

So, the problem can be transformed into finding a set of intervals (flips) such that their combined difference array gives a certain prefix XOR.

But how to model this. Let's define the required prefix XOR array.

The prefix XOR array P[i] is 1 for x_1, x_2, ..., x_k, and 0 otherwise. Then, the difference array D must be such that the cumulative XOR up to i is P[i]. The difference array D can be computed as D[i] = P[i] XOR P[i-1], where P[0] = 0. This is because:

P[i] = D[1] XOR D[2] XOR ... XOR D[i].

So, D[i] = P[i] XOR P[i-1].

Thus, the required difference array D is determined by the target prefix array.

So, the problem is to find a set of intervals (flips) such that the XOR of their individual difference arrays equals the required D array.

Each flip's difference array has 1's at s and e+1 (if e+1 <=n), and 0 elsewhere. So, the problem is to find a set of these intervals such that when their difference arrays are XORed together, the result is equal to the required D array.

Each flip contributes two 1's (or one if e+1 is beyond n) to the difference array. So, the required D array must be a combination of such pairs.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a set of pairs of positions (s, e+1) (for flips [s, e]) such that when XORed together, they form the required D array.

Moreover, each pair (s, e+1) must be a valid flip. The flip's length e - s + 1 must be in the a_i list.

This is a combinatorial problem. The required D array is known, and the question is to find the minimal number of pairs (s, t) where t = e+1, such that:

- For each pair, the length e - s +1 is in the a_i list (since e = t-1, so the length is (t-1) - s +1 = t - s).

- The XOR of all pairs' (s and t) gives the required D array.

Additionally, the pairs must be such that each s <= t-1 (since the interval is [s, t-1]).

So, the problem is now to find the minimal number of intervals (s, t-1) of lengths in a_i's such that their combined difference arrays (XOR) equal to the required D array.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using BFS, but the state would be the current XOR of the difference array, and transitions are adding new pairs (s, t) with length in a_i's.

But the required D array has non-zero entries only at certain positions. Let's compute the required D array.

The required D array is derived from the target prefix array P[i]. P[i] is 1 if i is one of the x's, else 0. Then, D[i] = P[i] XOR P[i-1], where P[0] = 0.

Let's compute this for the sample input:

Sample input 1:

x's are 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9.

So the prefix array P[i] is 1 at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. The D array is computed as follows:

For each i:

D[i] = P[i] XOR P[i-1].

For i=1: P[1] is 1, P[0] is 0 → D[1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1.

i=2: 1 XOR 1 = 0.

i=3: 1 XOR 1 = 0.

i=4: 0 XOR 1 (since P[3] is 1) → 1.

i=5: 1 XOR 0 → 1.

i=6: 1 XOR 1 → 0.

i=7: 1 XOR 1 → 0.

i=8: 1 XOR 1 →0.

i=9: 1 XOR 1 →0.

i=10: 0 XOR 1 →1.

So the required D array is:

D[1] = 1

D[2] = 0

D[3] = 0

D[4] = 1

D[5] = 1

D[6] = 0

D[7] = 0

D[8] = 0

D[9] = 0

D[10] = 1

But wait, the sample input's D array would look like this. So the required D array has 1's at positions 1,4,5,10, and 0's elsewhere.

Each flip contributes two 1's (or one) to the D array. For example, the first flip in the sample is [1,3], which adds 1's at 1 and 4 (since e+1 is 3+1=4). The second flip is [5,9], adding 1's at 5 and 10 (9+1=10). XORing these four 1's (since each is added once) gives the required D array.

So the required D array is the XOR of all the flip's difference arrays. Each flip's difference array is two 1's (or one if e+1 is beyond n). So, the required D array is a set of 1's at positions 1,4,5,10, and the sum of the flip's difference arrays must result in this.

The problem is thus to find a set of pairs (s, t), where each pair's length (t- s) is in the a_i list, such that when XORed, their difference arrays give the required D.

So, the minimal number of such pairs is the answer.

Now, how to model this.

This seems similar to a problem where you need to cover certain points with pairs of points (s, t) where each pair's length is allowed, and the parity of the number of pairs covering each point must match the required D array.

The challenge is to find the minimal number of such pairs.

This is a variant of the edge covering problem. Each pair (s, t) is an edge that connects s and t. The required D array is a set of points that must be covered an odd number of times, and others even.

But this is similar to forming a graph where the edges are allowed pairs (s, t), and the problem is to find a set of edges that covers all required points (those with D[i] =1) exactly once, and other points even times. Each edge contributes to two points (s and t). 

The parity of the number of times each point is covered must match the required D array.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of edges (allowed pairs) such that the sum of their endpoints (mod 2) equals the required D array.

Each edge represents a flip [s, t-1], with length (t-1 - s +1) = t-s. So the length is t-s, which must be in the a_i list.

So, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of edges (s, t) where t-s is in a_i's, such that the sum of their endpoints (s and t) in the D array is 1 for the required positions and 0 elsewhere.

But how to model this.

This is a problem of finding a minimal edge cover of the required parity points. Each edge contributes to exactly two points (s and t), flipping their parity. The required is to have exactly the points in the D array (which are the points with D[i] = 1) to have their parity flipped an odd number of times, and others even.

So, the problem is to find a set of edges (s, t) where t-s is in a_i's, such that the sum of their endpoints (mod 2) equals the required D array.

Moreover, each edge is allowed if and only if there exists a a_i such that t-s = a_i. Because the flip has length a_i.

Thus, the problem can be transformed into finding a set of edges with lengths in a_i's, such that the sum of their endpoints (mod 2) is the required D array, and the minimal number of edges.

This is a classic problem in graph theory, known as the parity cover problem, which is NP-hard. However, given that the number of required points (D[i] =1) is small, we can model this with BFS.

In our case, the required points are the positions where D[i] is 1. Let's call these positions the "active" points. Let's compute the active points for the required D array.

For example, in the sample input 1, the active points are 1,4,5,10.

The problem now is to pair these active points with edges (s, t) where t-s is in the a_i list. Each such edge "covers" s and t, toggling their parity. The goal is to pair all active points with edges such that each active point is covered exactly once, and the edges' lengths are allowed.

This is equivalent to finding a perfect matching of the active points into pairs, where each pair's distance is in the a_i list, and the minimal number of pairs. However, since the number of active points can be even or odd, this is possible only if the number of active points is even. Because each edge covers two points.

So, the first thing to check is whether the required D array has an even number of active points. If not, it's impossible.

For example, in the sample input 1, there are four active points (even), which can be covered by two edges. In the second sample input, let's compute the D array:

Sample input 2:

n=3, k=2. x's are 1,2.

The prefix array P[i] is 1 for i=1 and 2. The D array:

D[1] = 1 (1 XOR 0)
D[2] = 1 XOR 1 =0
D[3] = 0 XOR 1 (since P[2] is 1, but P[3] is 0) → 1.

So the active points are 1 and 3. The a_i list is [3]. The possible edges are (s, t) where t-s is 3. So s can be 1, t=4 (but n=3, so t-1=3 → t=4 is beyond n). So s=1, t=4 is invalid. Hence, no possible edges. So the answer is -1.

Thus, the first step is to check if the number of active points is even. If not, return -1.

So, the algorithm is:

1. Compute the required D array based on the x's.

2. Collect all the positions i where D[i] is 1. Let's call this list 'points'.

3. If the number of points is odd, return -1.

4. Otherwise, the problem is to find a way to pair these points using edges (s, t) where t-s is in the a_i list, and each edge is a valid interval (s <= n and t-1 <=n).

5. The minimal number of such edges needed to pair all points is the answer.

So, this is a matching problem. Each edge must connect two points, and the edge's length must be present in the a_i list.

But how to model this. The number of points can be up to O(n), but in practice, the D array is determined by the x's and their arrangement. The sample input 1 has four points. For k up to 10, the number of points is up to 2k+1, but perhaps more.

Wait, for k x's, the D array can have up to 2k+1 active points. For example, x's arranged in a way that each consecutive pair toggles the D array.

But in practice, the number of active points depends on the x's. Let's compute the number of active points:

Each x_j introduces a possible change in the D array. For example, x_1, x_2, ..., x_k:

D[x_1] = 1 (assuming x_1 is at least 1).

For x_j where j >1, D[x_j] = 1 if x_j is not adjacent to x_{j-1}+1.

But regardless, the number of active points can be up to O(k). For example, if x's are consecutive, then the active points are x_1 and x_k +1 (if x_k +1 <=n). So the number of active points can be small.

Thus, for the problem, the number of active points is up to 2k+2, which for k=10 is 22. So the problem is manageable.

So, the algorithm is:

- Compute the list of active points (points where D[i] =1).

- Check if the count is even.

- For each possible pairing of points into pairs, check if the distance between each pair is in the a_i list, and accumulate the minimal number of pairs.

But with up to 22 points, the number of possible pairings is (21)!! (double factorial), which is manageable for small numbers (like 4 points: 3 possible pairings). But for 22 points, this is impossible.

So, we need a more efficient approach.

This is a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each node is a subset of the active points, and each transition is adding a valid edge that pairs two points, removing them from the subset. The goal is to reach the empty subset with minimal steps.

The BFS approach would start with the initial subset of all active points, and each step applies a valid edge (pair of points) with a valid length, removing those two points from the subset.

The minimal number of steps to reach the empty subset is the answer.

For example, if there are four points, the BFS would start with the set {p1, p2, p3, p4}. Each possible valid edge (pairing two points with a valid length) would transition to a new subset with those two points removed. The minimal steps to reach the empty subset is the answer.

The number of possible states is 2^m, where m is the number of active points. For m=22, this is 4 million, which is manageable if the BFS is optimized.

But m can be up to 2k+2, which for k=10 is 22. 2^22 is about 4 million, which is manageable with BFS and bitmask representations.

So, the steps are:

1. Compute the active points (points list).

2. Check if the count is even. If not, return -1.

3. Generate all possible pairs of points (i, j) where i < j, and j - i is in the a_i list. Also, for each pair (i, j), check that the flip length (j - i) is in a_i's allowed list.

Wait, no. The length of the flip is (j - i), because the flip would be [i, j-1]. The length is j-1 -i +1 = j - i.

So, for a pair (i, j), the flip length is j - i, which must be present in the a_i list.

So, the allowed pairs are those (i, j) where j - i is in the a_i list.

Thus, for all pairs (i, j) in the points list, compute their distance (j - i). If the distance is in the a_i list, then this pair is allowed.

Once all allowed pairs are generated, the BFS can proceed.

The BFS state is a bitmask representing the current active points. For example, for points list of size m, each bit in the mask represents whether the corresponding point is still active.

The initial state is the mask with all bits set. The target is 0.

Each transition in the BFS is selecting an allowed pair (i, j) from the current active points, and removing them from the mask.

Thus, the BFS proceeds by iterating through all possible pairs that are allowed and present in the current mask.

The minimal number of steps to reach the target is the answer.

But how to generate the allowed pairs and manage the BFS efficiently.

Implementation steps:

- Generate the points list.

- If the size is odd, return -1.

- Generate all possible pairs (i, j) from the points list where j > i and (j - i) is in the a_i set.

- For each pair, create a bitmask of the two points and precompute the masks.

- Use BFS with a visited array (or dictionary) to track the minimal steps to reach each state.

This approach is feasible for up to 22 points, as the number of possible masks is 4 million and each state can be represented as a bitmask.

Now, let's think about the example.

Sample input 1:

points are 1,4,5,10.

Allowed a_i's are 3 and 5.

For pair (1,4): j-i =3, which is in the a_i list. So this is allowed. Applying this pair would remove points 1 and4.

Then, the remaining points are5 and 10. Their distance is 5, which is allowed. Applying this pair would remove them, resulting in the empty set. So total steps 2.

Which matches the sample.

Another possible pair is (1,5) j-i=4 (not in a_i list). So not allowed.

So the BFS finds the optimal path.

Thus, the BFS approach would correctly handle the sample.

Now, the code implementation steps:

1. Read n, k, l.

2. Read x's.

3. Compute the required D array.

4. Collect the points where D[i] is 1.

5. Check if the points count is even. If not, output -1.

6. Read the a_i list and create a set for quick look-up.

7. Generate all possible pairs (i, j) in the points list where j > i and j -i is in the a_i set.

8. Precompute these pairs and their corresponding masks.

9. Perform BFS:

   a. Initialize a queue with the initial mask (all bits set).

   b. For each state in the queue, generate all possible next states by applying each allowed pair that is present in the current mask.

   c. Keep track of visited states and their step counts.

   d. Once the target mask (0) is found, return the step count.

   e. If queue is exhausted, return -1.

But how to represent the mask. For example, if the points are [1,4,5,10], their indices are 0, 1, 2, 3 in the points list. The mask is a bitmask where bit i is set if the i-th point is active.

So for the initial mask, all bits are set (mask = (1<<m) -1, where m is the number of points).

Each pair (i, j) in the points list corresponds to their indices in the points list. For example, points[0] is 1, points[1] is4, etc.

So, when generating allowed pairs, the code must loop through all possible pairs of indices (u, v) in the points list where u < v, and check if points[v] - points[u] is in the a_i set.

If yes, then the pair can be added to the list of allowed pairs.

Then, during BFS, for each pair in the allowed pairs list, check if both bits u and v are set in the current mask. If so, the next mask is current_mask ^ (1<<u) ^ (1<<v).

The BFS proceeds until the mask is 0.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.

But let's handle the D array computation.

To compute the D array:

Initialize P as a dictionary or array, defaulting to 0.

For each x in the x's list, set P[x] =1.

Then, for each i from 1 to n:

D[i] = P[i] XOR P[i-1]

The points list is the collection of i where D[i] is 1.

So, code steps for D array:

prev = 0

points = []

for i in range(1, n+1):

    current = 1 if i in x_set else 0

    if current ^ prev:

        points.append(i)

    prev = current

But wait, this is not correct. Because P[i] is 1 for x's, and 0 otherwise. D[i] = P[i] ^ P[i-1], which is 1 if P[i] != P[i-1], else 0.

So, the points are the i where P[i] != P[i-1], i.e., the positions where the prefix array changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

So, to compute the points:

current_p = 0

points = []

prev_p = 0

for x in x_list:

    # from prev_p +1 to x-1: all 0

    # at x: current_p becomes 1

    # So, D[x] = 1 ^ 0 =1

    points.append(x)

    current_p = 1

    # check if x+1 is in x_list? No, since x_list is sorted.

    # so the next position after x is x+1, which may not be in x_list.

    # but for the next x in x_list, if it's x+1, then D[x+1] = 1 ^1 =0.

    # but if it's not x+1, then between x and the next x, there are positions where P[i] is 0.

    # So, the next D[i] is 0 ^1 =1.

    # So, the current_p is 1 until the next x.

    # So, the next x is x_new. For positions x+1 to x_new -1: P[i] is 0.

    # So, D[x_new] =1 ^0 =1.

    # So, for x_new, add to points.

    # Also, for the position after the last x, if it's <=n, then D[x_last +1] =0 ^1 =1.

So, the correct way to compute points is:

current_p = 0

points = []

prev = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):

    current = 1 if i in x_set else 0

    if current != prev:

        points.append(i)

    prev = current

# Also, check if prev is 1. If so, add n+1 (but only if n+1 <=n?)

Wait, no. The D array is for positions 1 to n. So, after processing i=n, there is no i+1. So, the D array has entries from 1 to n.

Thus, the code to generate the points is:

x_set = set(x_list)

prev_p = 0

points = []

for i in range(1, n+1):

    current_p = 1 if i in x_set else 0

    if current_p != prev_p:

        points.append(i)

    prev_p = current_p

So, this will generate the points where D[i] is 1.

For example, in the first sample input:

x_list is [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9]

Processing i from 1 to 10:

i=1: current_p=1 != prev_p (0) → add 1. prev_p=1.

i=2: current_p=1 == prev_p (1) → no add. prev_p remains 1.

i=3: same → no add.

i=4: current_p=0 != 1 → add 4. prev_p=0.

i=5: current_p=1 != 0 → add5. prev_p=1.

i=6: same → no add.

i=7: same → no add.

i=8: same → no add.

i=9: same → no add.

i=10: current_p=0 != 1 → add 10.

So points list is [1,4,5,10], which matches the sample.

Now, once the points are generated, if the count is odd, output -1.

Otherwise, proceed.

Next, generate all possible pairs of points (i, j) where j > i and j -i is in the a_set (the set of allowed lengths).

For each such pair, add to the allowed_pairs list.

Then, the BFS is performed using bitmask to track which points are still active.

The code can use a list of allowed transitions, which are pairs of indices in the points list (u, v) where u < v and (points[v] - points[u]) is in a_set.

For example, in the first sample:

points are [1,4,5,10]

allowed lengths are 3 and 5.

Pair (0,1): 4-1=3 → allowed. So this corresponds to the first flip (1-3), which is points 1 and4.

Pair (0,2):5-1=4 → not in a_set.

Pair (0,3):10-1=9 → not in a_set.

Pair (1,2):5-4=1 → not in a_set.

Pair (1,3):10-4=6 → not in a_set.

Pair (2,3):10-5=5 → allowed.

So allowed_pairs are (0,1) and (2,3).

These are the two pairs that can be used. The BFS would first process the initial mask 15 (binary 1111). Applying the first pair (0,1) would set the mask to 1100 (binary). Then, applying pair (2,3) would set it to 0. So steps 2.

Thus, the code would find the correct answer.

Now, implement this.

The code steps:

Read n, k, l.

Read x_list as sorted list.

Compute x_set for quick look-up.

Generate the points list as described.

Check if len(points) is even. If not, output -1.

Read a_list, and create a set (a_set).

Generate allowed_pairs as list of tuples (u, v) where u < v and points[v] - points[u] in a_set.

Precompute all such pairs.

BFS:

Use a queue for BFS. Each element is (mask, steps).

Use a visited array (or dictionary) to track the minimal steps to reach each mask.

Initialize with mask = (1 << m) -1, steps 0.

For each mask in the queue:

   if mask ==0 → return steps.

   for each allowed_pair (u, v):

       if bit u and bit v are set in mask:

           new_mask = mask ^ (1 <<u) ^ (1<<v)

           if new_mask not in visited or steps +1 < current steps for new_mask:

               add to queue, mark visited.

If queue is empty, return -1.

But for n up to 1e4 and m up to 22, this approach is feasible.

Now, code:

But let's handle the points list and allowed_pairs.

For example:

points = [1,4,5,10]

allowed_pairs would be (0,1) and (2,3).

In code:

m = len(points)

allowed_pairs = []

for u in range(m):

    for v in range(u+1, m):

        if (points[v] - points[u]) in a_set:

            allowed_pairs.append( (u, v) )

Then, during BFS, iterate through all allowed_pairs.

But for each pair, check if both bits are set.

But in code, for each pair in allowed_pairs:

if (mask & (1 <<u)) and (mask & (1 <<v)):

    new_mask = mask ^ ( (1<<u) | (1<<v) )

Now, code:

from collections import deque

n, k, l = map(int, input().split())

x_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Compute points where D[i] is 1

x_set = set(x_list)

prev_p = 0

points = []

for i in range(1, n+1):

    current_p = 1 if i in x_set else 0

    if current_p != prev_p:

        points.append(i)

    prev_p = current_p

m = len(points)

if m %2 !=0:

    print(-1)

    exit()

a_set = set(a_list)

allowed_pairs = []

for u in range(m):

    for v in range(u+1, m):

        if (points[v] - points[u]) in a_set:

            allowed_pairs.append( (u, v) )

# BFS

target = 0

initial_mask = (1 << m) -1

visited = {initial_mask: 0}

queue = deque([initial_mask])

while queue:

    mask = queue.popleft()

    steps = visited[mask]

    if mask == target:

        print(steps)

        exit()

    for u, v in allowed_pairs:

        if (mask & (1 << u)) and (mask & (1 << v)):

            new_mask = mask ^ ( (1 << u) | (1 << v) )

            if new_mask not in visited or steps +1 < visited.get(new_mask, float('inf')):

                visited[new_mask] = steps +1

                queue.append(new_mask)

print(-1)

Wait, but the code might not handle the case where there are multiple ways to reach the same mask with different step counts. Hence, we need to ensure that once a mask is visited with a certain step count, any later steps with higher counts are ignored.

The current code uses a dictionary 'visited' which stores the minimal steps to reach each mask. When processing a new_mask, if new_mask is not in visited or steps+1 is less than the existing steps, it is added.

This should work.

Testing the first sample:

points = [1,4,5,10]

allowed_pairs = (0,1) and (2,3).

The initial mask is 15 (1111).

Processing mask 15:

steps is 0.

For pair (0,1):

new_mask = 15 ^ 3 → 12 (1100). Steps 1.

Add to queue.

For pair (2,3):

new_mask = 15 ^ (0b1100) → 3 (0011). Steps 1.

Add to queue.

Next, processing mask 12 (1100):

steps is 1.

Check allowed pairs. Only (0,1) is in allowed_pairs, but in this mask, bits 0 and 1 are not set. So no.

Other pairs: allowed_pairs includes (0,1) and (2,3). But in mask 12, bits 2 and 3 are set (mask 1100 is 12 in binary → 1100, which is bits 2 and 3 set for a 4-bit mask? Wait, no. Wait, the mask is a bitmask of m bits. For m=4, the bits are 0 (LSB), 1, 2, 3.

So mask 12 is binary 1100 → bits 2 and 3 are set (bit 3 is the fourth bit). So the allowed pairs are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). But in the allowed_pairs list, only (0,1) and (2,3) are allowed.

In mask 12, bits 2 and 3 are set (since 12 in binary is 1100). So pair (2,3) is available (u=2, v=3). So new_mask would be 12 ^ (1<<2 | 1<<3) → 12 ^ (4 +8) → 12 ^ 12 = 0. So steps is 2. Target reached.

Thus, code would output 2.

But in the BFS, after processing mask 15 (steps 0), the queue has masks 12 and 3.

When processing mask 12 (steps 1), the code checks allowed pairs. For pair (2,3), which is allowed? points[2] is 5, points[3] is 10. 10-5=5, which is in the a_list. So this pair is allowed.

Yes, allowed_pairs includes (2,3). So processing this pair:

mask is 12 (binary 1100 → bits 2 and3 are set). So new_mask is 12 ^ ( (1<<2) | (1<<3) ) → 12 ^ (4 +8) → 12 ^12 =0. Steps becomes 1+1=2.

Add new_mask 0 to the queue with steps 2.

When mask 0 is processed, return steps 2.

Thus, the code works.

The code correctly handles the sample.

Now, testing the second sample input:

3 2 1

1 2

3

x_list = [1,2]

points:

Processing i from 1 to 3:

i=1: current_p=1, prev=0 → add 1. prev=1.

i=2: current_p=1 == prev → no add. prev=1.

i=3: current_p=0 != prev → add 3. prev=0.

points are [1,3]. Length is 2, even.

a_list is [3].

allowed_pairs:

pair (0,1): 3-1=2, which is not in a_list (3). So not allowed.

Thus, allowed_pairs is empty.

So, BFS starts with mask 0b11 (3). No allowed pairs. So queue is processed, no solution. Output -1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code is correct.
