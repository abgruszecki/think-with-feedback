Okay, let's try to solve this problem. The task is to count the number of d-magic numbers between a and b (inclusive) that are multiples of m. And because the numbers can be up to 2000 digits long, we need an efficient way to process this without iterating through every possible number, which would be computationally impossible.

First, I need to understand what a d-magic number is. From the problem statement, a number is d-magic if the digit d appears in all even positions and nowhere else. Even positions here—wait, the example says that 1727374 is 7-magic. Let's check its digits. Let's see: positions are probably counted starting from the right or left? Wait, for example, 1727374 has 7 digits. Let's see the positions:

If positions are considered from left to right, starting at 1 (the first digit is position 1), then even positions are 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. For 1727374:

Digits are 1 (pos 1), 7 (pos 2), 2 (pos3), 7 (pos4), 3 (pos5), 7 (pos6), 4 (pos7). The even positions here are 2,4,6, which are all 7. The other positions (1,3,5,7) are 1,2,3,4, which are not 7. So this is a valid 7-magic number.

So the even positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) must all be d. And the other positions (odd positions) must not be d. Also, the number must not have any occurrence of d outside of even positions.

Wait, but for example, the number 17 is 7-magic. It has two digits. Even positions (position 2) is 7. The odd position (position 1) is 1, which is not 7. So that's valid. Similarly, 1 (a single-digit number) is considered 7-magic. Wait, the problem statement says that 1 is 7-magic. But how? If the number is 1 (single digit), the even positions would be positions 2,4, etc., which don't exist. So for a number with length L, the even positions are positions 2,4,6,... up to L if L is even. So for a number with even number of digits, the last even position is the last digit. For example, a 4-digit number has even positions 2 and 4.

Wait, no. Wait, for a 4-digit number, positions 1,2,3,4. Even positions are 2 and 4. So all even positions must be d. All other positions (1 and 3) must not be d.

So for a number to be d-magic:

- All even positions (positions 2,4,6, etc.) must have digit d.
- All other positions (odd positions) must not have digit d.
- Additionally, there's the edge case where the number has an odd length. For example, a 3-digit number: even positions are 2. So that digit must be d. Positions 1 and 3 must not be d.

So the first step is to generate all numbers in [a,b] that fit this d-magic condition. Then, among those, count how many are divisible by m.

But given that a and b can be up to 2000 digits, iterating through each number is impossible. So we need a dynamic programming approach to count the valid numbers modulo m, and also check the d-magic condition.

So the problem is similar to a digit DP problem. Digit DP is used to count numbers with certain properties in a range [a, b]. Here, the constraints are:

1. The number must be d-magic.
2. The number must be divisible by m.

So, the plan is to model this as a digit DP problem, where we track the necessary states to enforce the d-magic condition and the modulo m.

Let's break down the d-magic condition. For each position in the number:

- If the position is even (starting from 1 for the leftmost digit), the digit must be d.
- If the position is odd, the digit must not be d.

But wait, for a number of length L, positions are numbered from left to right as 1 to L. So even positions are 2,4,6,... up to L if L is even, or L-1 if L is odd. So for each digit in the number, depending on its position, it must be d (even positions) or not d (odd positions).

So the digits are constrained based on their position. For example, in a 4-digit number:

Positions 1: must not be d.

Position 2: must be d.

Position 3: must not be d.

Position 4: must be d.

So when building the number digit by digit, each position's digit is constrained. Thus, the DP must track the position and whether the current prefix meets the constraints up to that position.

So, the DP state will need to track:

- The current position in the number (up to the maximum length of a and b, which are the same according to the input constraints).
- The modulo of the current number with m (to track divisibility).
- Whether the current number is tight (i.e., bounded by the upper and lower limits a and b).

But also, for each position, we need to enforce the d-magic constraints. So, for each step:

At even positions, the digit must be exactly d. So during the DP transition, when the position is even, the next digit can only be d. If d is not allowed (e.g., if the current prefix is tight and the next digit in the upper bound is less than d), then this path is invalid.

At odd positions, the digit can be any digit except d, but also must not exceed the upper bound's digit if tight, etc.

Wait, but how to model this in the DP? Let's think.

The digits are built from left to right. For each position, we need to determine if it's even or odd. The position is known as we build the digits. So the DP state includes the position, so that we can check if it's even or odd.

So for each position i (starting from 0 or 1?), we can determine if it's even or odd. Let's assume positions are 1-based (i.e., first digit is position 1, second is 2, etc.). So for position i:

If i is even (i mod 2 == 0?), wait no. Wait, position 1 is odd, position 2 even, etc. So for position i, parity is even if i is even. Wait, no: 1 is odd, 2 even, 3 odd, etc. So if the current position is even (i%2 == 0?), then that's an even position, and the digit must be d.

So, for example, position 2 is even: digit must be d.

Therefore, in the DP, for each step (position i), we check if it's even. If even, the current digit must be d, else it can't be d.

So the DP transitions must enforce this.

So the steps to model this are:

1. Generate all numbers between a and b with the same number of digits as a and b (since input constraints state that a and b have the same number of digits).

2. For each number, check the d-magic conditions and divisibility by m.

But since the numbers are up to 2000 digits long, the DP approach must track the necessary state to count valid numbers efficiently.

The key idea is to model the problem using dynamic programming where the state tracks:

- The current position in the number (i.e., which digit we are processing).
- The remainder when the number formed so far is divided by m.
- A flag indicating whether the number is already less than the upper bound (b) or exactly equal to it up to the current position (tight_upper).
- Similarly, a flag indicating whether the number is already greater than the lower bound (a) or exactly equal (tight_lower).
- Also, for leading zeros? Wait, but the numbers are given without leading zeros, and a and b are positive. So all numbers considered are exactly the same length as a and b, which have no leading zeros. So leading zeros are not allowed, and the numbers must have exactly the same number of digits as a and b.

Wait, the input says that a and b are given without leading zeros, and that their number of digits is the same. So the numbers we consider must have exactly the same number of digits. So leading zeros are not allowed. So the first digit (position 1) must be non-zero.

Wait, but for example, a and b are 1000-9999. So all numbers considered are 4 digits. So in the DP, the first digit (position 1) must be between 1 and 9 (since leading zeros are not allowed).

So the DP must start with the first digit, which is position 1 (odd), which must not be d. So during the first digit selection, the possible digits are 1-9, excluding d. Then position 2 is even, must be d. Then position 3 is odd, must not be d, etc.

Thus, the DP is constrained in such a way that for even positions, the digit is fixed to d. For odd positions, the digit can be any digit except d, but also must comply with the upper and lower bounds (a and b).

So the DP approach needs to:

For each position i (from 1 to L, where L is the length of the numbers):

- If i is even: must choose d as the digit. But check if that's possible given the tight constraints (i.e., whether the current path is tight with the upper/lower bound, and whether d is within the allowed digits for that position).

- If i is odd: choose any digit except d, again considering tight constraints.

Additionally, track the modulo m of the number formed so far, so that at the end, we can check if the number is divisible by m (modulo 0).

So the DP state can be represented as:

dp[pos][mod][tight_lower][tight_upper] = number of ways to form a number up to pos digits, with current mod, and the tight flags.

But given that the length can be up to 2000, and m up to 2000, the state size would be 2000 (positions) * 2000 (mod) * 2 (tight_lower) * 2 (tight_upper). This is manageable because 2000*2000*2*2 is 16 million, which is acceptable for Python, especially with memoization using a dictionary or array.

But in Python, using memoization with lru_cache might not be efficient for such a large state. So perhaps a more iterative approach is needed, using a 4-dimensional DP array. However, given the possible size, even that might be manageable. Let's see.

But perhaps the tight_lower and tight_upper can be merged into a single tight_lower and tight_upper flag. For example, for each position, we track whether the current number is already above a (so tight_lower is 0 or 1) and whether it's already below b (tight_upper is 0 or 1). But combining these two flags into separate variables may be necessary.

Alternatively, for the problem, since the numbers must be between a and b, inclusive, perhaps the DP can calculate the count for numbers ≤b, subtract the count for numbers <a, and then take the result modulo 1e9+7. That way, we can split the problem into two parts: compute f(b) - f(a-1), where f(x) is the number of valid numbers up to x.

But since a and b are 2000-digit numbers, subtracting 1 from a (to compute a-1) is possible, but handling the large numbers as strings is necessary. So first, we can compute the count for [0, b], then subtract the count for [0, a-1], provided that a is not zero (which it can't be, as per the input constraints).

So the plan is:

1. Compute the count of valid numbers (d-magic and divisible by m) up to and including b.

2. Compute the count of valid numbers up to and including a-1.

3. The answer is (count_b - count_a_minus_1) mod (1e9+7).

But first, we need to handle the cases where a is zero. But according to the input constraints, a is a positive integer, so a-1 could be zero, but the numbers considered must have exactly the same number of digits as a and b. Wait, no. Because a and b have the same number of digits. So when subtracting 1 from a (if a is, say, 1000), then a-1 is 999, which is one digit less. So the numbers in the lower part (a-1) have one less digit, but the problem states that all numbers considered have the same number of digits as a and b. Therefore, the approach of computing f(b) - f(a-1) may not be correct.

Wait, the problem statement says that a and b have the same number of digits. So the numbers considered are all in the same digit length as a and b. For example, if a is 10 and b is 99, then all numbers considered are two-digit. So when we compute the count of numbers up to b, but only two-digit numbers, and subtract the count of numbers up to a-1 (which is 9, a single-digit number), but since a-1 has fewer digits, none of those numbers are considered. Thus, the correct approach is to compute the count of valid numbers in the same digit length as a and b, and which are between a and b.

So the approach of splitting into upper and lower may not work. Instead, we need to compute the numbers in the exact same digit length as a and b, and which are between a and b (inclusive).

So the correct way is to model the DP with the exact digit length of a and b, and also check whether the number is ≥a and ≤b.

This complicates the DP, as we need to track both the upper and lower bounds.

An alternative approach is to compute the count of numbers in the same digit length that are ≤b and satisfy the d-magic and mod conditions, then subtract the count of numbers in the same digit length that are <a. The result is the count in [a, b].

But how to compute the count of numbers in the same digit length that are <= X (for X being a or b) and satisfy the constraints.

So, the plan is:

Compute the count of d-magic numbers with exactly L digits (same as a and b), which are multiples of m, and ≤ X. Then, the answer is count(b) - count(a-1).

But again, a-1 might have fewer digits. So in that case, count(a-1) would be zero, because there are no numbers with L digits that are ≤ a-1 (which has L-1 digits). So for example, if a is 100 (3 digits), then a-1 is 99 (2 digits). All numbers considered are 3 digits, so numbers ≤99 are not considered. Thus, count(a-1) would be zero.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

Compute the number of d-magic numbers with exactly L digits, ≤b, and divisible by m.

Minus the number of d-magic numbers with exactly L digits, <a, and divisible by m.

So, the problem is split into two parts: calculate the upper bound (b) and the lower bound (a), subtract the lower count from the upper count.

So, the solution is to write a function f(X) that returns the count of d-magic numbers with exactly L digits, ≤X, divisible by m. Then the answer is (f(b) - f(a-1)) mod MOD.

But how to implement f(X) given that X can be up to 2000 digits?

This requires a digit DP approach that processes X as a string, and tracks the necessary constraints.

So the DP for f(X) would need to:

1. Enforce that the number has exactly L digits (same as X).

2. Enforce the d-magic condition.

3. Ensure the number is ≤X.

4. Track the current modulo m.

So, the key steps for the DP are:

For each position in the L digits:

- If the position is even (i.e., position 2,4,6,...), then the digit must be d. So in the DP transition, for even positions, the next digit must be d, and the code must check whether this is allowed given the current tight constraints (i.e., if the current prefix is exactly the same as X up to the previous digit, then the next digit can't exceed X's digit at this position).

- If the position is odd, the digit must be not d, and also must be between 0 and 9, but also must not exceed X's digit if tight.

Additionally, the first digit (position 1) must be non-zero (since leading zeros are not allowed).

So, the DP state will track:

- Position (pos): current digit being processed (from 0 to L-1, perhaps 0-based).

- mod: current remainder modulo m.

- tight: a flag indicating whether the current prefix is exactly matching X's prefix up to this position (so that subsequent digits cannot exceed X's digits).

- leading_zero: perhaps, but in this problem, leading zeros are not allowed. So the first digit must be non-zero.

Wait, but since the numbers have exactly L digits (same as X), leading zeros are not allowed, so the first digit must be ≥1.

Thus, the DP must ensure that the first digit (position 1) is non-zero and not d if position 1 is odd.

So, let's model the DP state as:

state = (pos, mod, tight, is_lower) ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to track two tight flags: tight_lower and tight_upper, but maybe in this case, since we are comparing to a single X, the tight flag indicates whether the current prefix is exactly matching X's digits up to this position (so that the next digits can't exceed X's digits).

So for f(X), the DP will track:

At each step (position), whether the current number is already less than X (so the remaining digits can be anything), or is exactly equal up to this point (so the next digits can't exceed X's digits).

So, the state variables for the DP are:

- pos: current position (0-based, starting from 0 to L-1).

- mod: the remainder modulo m.

- tight: whether the current prefix is exactly equal to X's prefix up to this position (so that next digits are limited by X's digits).

But since the numbers are exactly L digits, and leading zeros are not allowed, the first digit (position 0 in 0-based) must be between 1 and 9, except d if the position is odd (since position 0 is 0-based, so in 0-based terms, even positions (1-based) are even in 0-based? Wait, I think I need to clarify.

Wait, in 0-based positions:

For example, L=4 digits. The positions are 0,1,2,3 (digits D0, D1, D2, D3).

In 1-based terms, positions are 1,2,3,4. So even positions in 1-based are 2,4, etc. So in 0-based, even positions are 1 and 3. So for each 0-based position i, the 1-based is i+1. So even positions in 1-based correspond to 0-based positions where (i+1) is even → i is odd.

Wait, that's confusing. Let's clarify:

If the position is 1-based (i=1 to L), even positions are i even. So for 0-based (i=0 to L-1), even positions in 1-based correspond to 0-based i being (i+1) even → i is odd.

So, for a 0-based position i, if (i+1) is even → the position is even in 1-based terms → the digit must be d.

So, for the 0-based i:

even_1_based = (i+1) % 2 == 0 → i is odd.

So, in 0-based terms, for even positions in 1-based, the 0-based index i is odd.

So, when processing digit i (0-based), if i is odd (i+1 even), then the digit must be d.

If i is even (i+1 odd), then the digit must be not d.

This is important for the DP transitions.

So, for each digit in the number:

- For even 1-based positions (i+1 even → i is 0-based odd), the digit must be d.

- For odd 1-based positions (i is 0-based even), the digit must not be d.

So in the DP transitions, when building the digits:

At position i (0-based):

if i is odd → digit must be d.

if i is even → digit must not be d.

But also, the first digit (i=0) must be ≥1 (no leading zeros).

So, the DP transitions must enforce these constraints.

Now, let's model the DP.

The DP for f(X) (count of valid numbers ≤X) can be represented with the following state variables:

- pos: current position (0-based from 0 to L-1).

- mod: current modulo m (since we need to track if the entire number is divisible by m).

- tight: a boolean indicating whether the current digits so far are exactly matching X up to this position (so that any further digits must not exceed X's digits).

The DP transitions would then be as follows:

At each step, for the current state (pos, mod, tight):

If pos is even (0-based even → 1-based odd → must not be d):

We can choose any digit from 0 to 9 (but must not be d) unless tight, in which case the digit can't exceed X[pos].

But wait, for even 0-based positions (i even), the 1-based is i+1, which is odd. So for these positions, the digit must not be d.

So, for 0-based even positions (i even), the allowed digits are 0-9 except d.

But for the first digit (i=0), the digit must be ≥1.

So for i=0:

digits can be from 1 to 9, except d.

For i even and i>0:

digits can be 0-9 except d.

But also, if tight is True, the digit can't exceed X[pos].

So, for each possible digit in the allowed set, check if it's allowed under tight constraints.

For example:

If tight is True, then the current digit can be at most X[pos]. If we choose a digit less than X[pos], then the tight becomes False for the next positions. If we choose a digit equal to X[pos], tight remains True.

For each possible digit in the allowed set for the current position:

if the digit is allowed (i.e., not d for even positions in 0-based, or exactly d for odd positions in 0-based), and under tight constraints, then proceed.

So, the steps for the DP:

Initialize the DP with pos=0, mod=0, tight=True (since we are building the number digit by digit, starting from the first digit). But wait, the first digit can be chosen only as per the constraints.

But for the first position (i=0, 0-based), which is even (0-based even → 1-based odd), so the digit must not be d, and >=1.

So, the initial state is pos=0, mod=0, tight=True. Then, we iterate through possible digits for the first position (1-9, not d), check if they are allowed, and if tight is True, the digit must not exceed X[0].

Then, for each next position, we check if the position is even (0-based) or odd (0-based):

Wait, for position i (0-based):

if i is even (i mod 2 == 0) → then it's an odd 1-based position → digit must not be d.

if i is odd (i mod 2 == 1) → even 1-based → digit must be d.

So, for each position, the allowed digits are:

if i is even: digits not equal to d.

if i is odd: digit must be d.

Thus, in the DP, for each position i (0-based):

if i is even:

allowed_digits = [digits in 0-9 except d], except for i=0 (which must be >=1).

if i is odd:

allowed_digits = [d]

Now, for tight constraints: when building the digits, if tight is True, the current digit cannot exceed X[i].

So, for each state (pos, mod, tight), we iterate through the allowed digits.

For each digit in allowed_digits:

if tight is True:

digit can't be larger than X[pos].

If digit > X[pos]: skip this digit.

If digit < X[pos]: new_tight = False.

If digit == X[pos]: new_tight = True.

Then, compute the new_mod = (mod * 10 + digit) mod m.

Proceed to the next position with the new state (pos+1, new_mod, new_tight).

The base case is when pos == L (after processing all digits):

Check if the number is a valid d-magic number (which is ensured by the allowed digits in each step) and if mod == 0.

Thus, when pos == L, we return 1 if mod ==0, else 0.

Thus, the DP can be memoized using these states.

But given that the positions are up to 2000, and mod up to 2000, and tight can be True or False, the number of states is 2000 * 2000 * 2 = 8,000,000. Which is manageable.

So, the DP can be implemented using memoization or a table.

But in Python, recursion for 2000 levels may hit a recursion depth limit, so an iterative approach is better.

Thus, the plan is to implement an iterative DP with memoization.

But wait, how to handle the leading zeros? Since the numbers are exactly L digits, the first digit cannot be zero. So for i=0 (0-based), even though it's even (0-based even), the allowed digits are 1-9 except d.

So, for the first digit (i=0):

allowed_digits = [1-9] excluding d.

For other even i (i>0, even):

allowed_digits = [0-9] excluding d.

But for even i (0-based even, 1-based odd), the digits can be 0-9 except d.

For odd i (0-based odd, 1-based even), digits must be d.

So, the DP needs to handle these constraints.

Thus, the code for the DP transitions would look like this:

For each position i from 0 to L-1:

   if i is even:

      allowed_digits = list of digits not equal to d. For i=0, digits are 1-9 and not d. For i>0, digits are 0-9 and not d.

   else:

      allowed_digits = [d]

   for each digit in allowed_digits:

      if tight is True:

          if digit > X[i]: skip.

          elif digit == X[i]: new_tight = True.

          else: new_tight = False.

      else:

          new_tight = False.

      new_mod = (current_mod * 10 + digit) % m.

      proceed to next state.

Now, the problem is to compute f(X) using this DP.

But X is a string, and L is the length of X.

But in our problem, a and b are given as strings. So, to compute f(b), we process the string b. To compute f(a-1), we need to compute the string representation of a-1. But since a and b have the same number of digits, and a <= b, a-1 may have fewer digits. So in that case, f(a-1) would be zero, as there are no numbers with L digits that are <= a-1 (since a-1 has L-1 digits).

Thus, the steps to compute the answer are:

1. Compute the number of valid numbers <= b, with L digits. Call this count_b.

2. Compute the number of valid numbers < a, with L digits. This is the same as the number of valid numbers <= (a-1), but if a-1 has fewer digits than L, then this count is zero. So, first check if a is 10...0 (like a=1000). Then, a-1 is 999, which has L-1 digits. So, for this case, the count_a_minus_1 is zero.

But how to compute a-1 as a string? For example, a is "10", a-1 is "9". But since the length is 2, but the new string is shorter, so in the count_a_minus_1, there are no valid numbers (since the L is 2, but a-1 is 1 digit). So, in this case, count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Thus, the code needs to handle the case where a-1 has fewer digits than L. In that case, count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Otherwise, compute the count for a-1 as a string with L digits. But how to subtract 1 from a string?

So, the first step is to implement a function to subtract 1 from a string. For example, "1000" becomes "0999" (but leading zeros are not allowed, but when we subtract 1, the result is "999", but since we need a string of length L-1. So, in code, when a is "1000", subtract 1 gives "999", which is length 3, which is less than L=4. So, in this case, the count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Thus, the code to compute a_minus_1 is:

def subtract_one(s):

    s_list = list(s)

    i = len(s_list) - 1

    while i >= 0 and s_list[i] == '0':

        s_list[i] = '9'

        i -= 1

    if i < 0:

        return '0' * (len(s) - 1)  # all zeros, but subtract 1 becomes 999... with len-1 digits?

    s_list[i] = str(int(s_list[i]) - 1)

    if s_list[0] == '0':

        # leading zero, so the length is reduced.

        # So return a string with len-1 digits.

        # But for example, original length is 4, a is 1000, subtract 1 gives 999 (len 3).

        return ''.join(s_list[i:]).lstrip('0') or '0'

    return ''.join(s_list)

But this function would return a string that is one less than the input. However, if the input is "1000", it returns "0999", but leading zeros are stripped. Wait, the code as written would first process the s_list as ['1', '0', '0', '0'], then subtract 1:

i starts at 3, s_list[3] is '0', set to '9', i becomes 2.

s_list[2] is '0', set to '9', i becomes 1.

s_list[1] is '0', set to '9', i becomes 0.

Then, s_list[0] is '1', subtract 1 to '0'.

So s_list becomes ['0', '9', '9', '9'].

Then, the code checks if the first character is '0' (it is), and returns s_list[i:] → which is s_list[0:] → '0999', then lstrip('0') → '999', which has 3 digits. So the result is '999', which is 3 digits, which is less than the original length (4). So in this case, the count_a_minus_1 is zero.

But if a is "2000", then a_minus_1 is "1999" (same length), so the count is computed for L digits.

So, the code for subtract_one would need to return the correct a-1 string, and then check if its length is L. If not, then the count_a_minus_1 is zero.

So, in code:

Compute a_minus_1_str = subtract_one(a_str).

If len(a_minus_1_str) != L, then count_a_minus_1 = 0.

Else, compute count_a_minus_1 using the DP function for a_minus_1_str.

Then, the answer is (count_b - count_a_minus_1) mod MOD.

Now, the next step is to implement the DP function for a given X_str (a string of L digits), to compute the number of valid numbers ≤X_str that are d-magic and divisible by m.

Implementing this DP requires:

- Preprocessing X_str into a list of integers (digits).

- Initializing a DP table that tracks for each pos, mod, tight: the number of ways to reach this state.

The DP can be implemented using a 3-dimensional array (pos, mod, tight) → count.

We can use a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach. For efficiency, a bottom-up approach is better.

The steps for the DP:

Initialize a 2D array (current DP state) for the current pos. For each step, we compute the next state based on the current state.

The initial state is pos=0, mod=0, tight=1 (True). But wait, for the first digit (pos=0), we need to choose a digit according to the constraints.

So, the initial DP is:

At pos=0, for all possible mod and tight states.

But in the beginning, before processing any digits, the mod is 0, and tight is True. So, the initial state is:

pos=0, mod=0, tight=True.

We can represent tight as 1 (True) and 0 (False).

So, the DP starts with a dictionary or array that represents the current state.

Let's consider using a 2D array for each step: dp[mod][tight] = count.

But since for each step, the mod and tight are tracked, we can use a list of dictionaries or a 2D array.

But given that m can be up to 2000, and tight can be 0 or 1, the size is manageable.

So, for each position i, we can have a 2D array (current_mod, tight) → count.

At each step, we transition from the current state to the next state.

The steps are as follows:

For each position from 0 to L-1:

   For each possible mod in 0..m-1:

      For each tight in 0,1:

          if the current count is zero, skip.

          else:

              determine the allowed digits for the current position.

              for each allowed digit:

                  check if the digit is allowed under the tight constraints.

                  compute new_tight and new_mod.

                  update the next state (pos+1, new_mod, new_tight) by adding the current count.

Thus, the code can be structured with two layers of the DP table: the current DP (for pos i) and the next DP (for pos i+1).

Let's outline the code steps.

First, convert X_str into a list of integers, X_digits.

Then, initialize the DP.

current_dp is a 2D array (mod, tight) → count.

Initially, at pos=0, current_dp is empty except for mod=0, tight=1 (if the first digit allows).

Wait, no. At pos=0, we start with mod=0, tight=1 (True), and process the first digit.

So, initialize current_dp as a dictionary where mod=0 and tight=1 has count=1.

Wait, no. Wait, before processing any digits, the number is 0 mod m. When processing the first digit, the mod becomes (0 * 10 + digit) mod m. So, the initial state (before any digits) is mod=0, tight=1 (since no digits have been processed yet, and the tight flag indicates that we are in a state where the digits chosen so far exactly match X up to the current position. But for pos=0, we are about to choose the first digit.

Wait, perhaps it's better to initialize the DP before the first digit (pos=0) with mod=0 and tight=1, and then process each digit from pos 0 to L-1.

So, the code would be:

def count_valid(X_str, m, d, L):

    X_digits = list(map(int, X_str))

    current_dp = [ [0]*2 for _ in range(m) ]

    current_dp[0][1] = 1  # initial state: mod 0, tight=1.

    for pos in range(L):

        next_dp = [ [0]*2 for _ in range(m) ]

        for mod in range(m):

            for tight in [0, 1]:

                cnt = current_dp[mod][tight]

                if cnt == 0:

                    continue

                # Determine allowed digits for current position.

                if pos % 2 == 0:  # 0-based even → 1-based odd → must not be d.

                    if pos == 0:

                        # first digit, cannot be zero.

                        allowed_digits = [dig for dig in range(1, 10) if dig != d]

                    else:

                        allowed_digits = [dig for dig in range(0, 10) if dig != d]

                else:  # pos is odd → 1-based even → must be d.

                    allowed_digits = [d]

                # Iterate over allowed digits.

                for dig in allowed_digits:

                    if tight:

                        max_dig = X_digits[pos]

                        if dig > max_dig:

                            continue  # can't choose this digit.

                        new_tight = tight and (dig == max_dig)

                    else:

                        new_tight = 0

                    new_mod = (mod * 10 + dig) % m

                    next_dp[new_mod][new_tight] += cnt

                    next_dp[new_mod][new_tight] %= MOD

        current_dp = next_dp

    # After processing all digits, sum the counts where mod is 0.

    # The tight flag doesn't matter, since all numbers have L digits.

    return (current_dp[0][0] + current_dp[0][1]) % MOD

But wait, in this code, for each allowed digit, new_tight is set as follows:

if tight is True, then check if the digit is <= X_digits[pos]. If yes, then new_tight is True only if the digit is equal to X_digits[pos].

Otherwise, new_tight is False.

But the code uses 'tight' as a boolean (0 or 1), and for the allowed digit, if tight is 1, and the digit is > X_digits[pos], then skip.

Otherwise, compute new_tight as tight and (dig == X_digits[pos]).

Yes.

So, this code should correctly track the tight condition.

But there's a problem: the code allows leading zeros? Wait, no. Because for the first digit (pos=0), which is even (0-based even, so 1-based odd), the allowed digits are 1-9 except d. So leading zeros are not allowed.

Yes.

But wait, what if d is 0? For example, d=0. Then the first digit can't be 0 (since pos=0 is even (0-based), so the allowed digits are 1-9 except 0. So allowed digits are 1-9. So leading zeros are prevented.

Yes.

Thus, this code should correctly handle all cases.

Now, the code for subtract_one:

def subtract_one(s):

    s_list = list(s)

    i = len(s_list) - 1

    while i >= 0 and s_list[i] == '0':

        s_list[i] = '9'

        i -= 1

    if i < 0:

        return '0'

    s_list[i] = str(int(s_list[i]) - 1)

    # After subtracting, check leading zeros.

    if s_list[0] == '0':

        # leading zeros, so the number has reduced length.

        # For example, '1000' becomes '0999' → '999'.

        new_s = ''.join(s_list).lstrip('0')

        return new_s if new_s else '0'

    else:

        return ''.join(s_list)

But in the case where the input is '1', subtracting one would give '0', which is allowed.

Now, the code for the problem:

Read m, d.

Read a_str, b_str.

Compute L = len(a_str). Since a and b have the same length.

Compute count_b = count_valid(b_str, m, d, L).

Compute a_minus_1_str = subtract_one(a_str).

If len(a_minus_1_str) != L:

    count_a_minus_1 = 0

else:

    count_a_minus_1 = count_valid(a_minus_1_str, m, d, L)

The answer is (count_b - count_a_minus_1) % MOD.

But what about the case where a_minus_1_str is not a valid L-digit number?

For example, a_str is '10' (L=2), a_minus_1_str is '9' (L=1). So count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Thus, the code correctly handles that.

Now, let's test this with the first example:

Sample input:

2 6

10

99

L=2.

count_b is the count of numbers <=99, 2-digit, even positions (1-based) must be 6.

So even positions (1-based 2) is position 1 (0-based), which must be 6.

For 2-digit numbers, the second digit (position 1) must be 6. The first digit (position 0, even in 0-based → must be not 6) must be 1-9 except 6.

So possible first digits are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9. And second digit is 6.

So numbers are 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 76, 86, 96 → 8 numbers.

Check if these numbers are divisible by 2: all even. Yes. So count_b is 8.

a_str is '10', a_minus_1 is '9', which has length 1. So count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Thus, answer is 8-0=8.

Which matches the sample.

Another sample:

Input:

2 0

1

9

So m=2, d=0.

Numbers are 1-digit numbers (L=1). The even positions are 1-based even (i.e., even positions are 2,4, etc.), but for 1-digit numbers, there are no even positions. So the number is 0-magic if all even positions (none) are 0, and no other positions have 0. But since the even positions are none, the condition is satisfied. So the digits can be any except 0 in all other positions (odd positions). But for a 1-digit number, the position is 1-based 1 (odd), so the digit must not be 0.

So the valid numbers are 2,4,6,8. Which are divisible by 2.

Thus, the answer is 4.

Which matches the sample.

Third sample:

Input:

19 7

1000

9999

L=4.

We need to count 4-digit numbers where even positions (1-based 2 and 4 → 0-based 1 and 3) are 7. The other positions (0-based 0 and 2) must not be 7.

So the digits are D0 (not 7), D1 (7), D2 (not 7), D3 (7).

The number must be divisible by 19.

The sample says 6 numbers.

So the code should compute count_b (9999) and count_a_minus_1 (999).

But a_str is '1000', subtract_one gives '0999' → length 3, so count_a_minus_1 is 0.

Thus, answer is count_b.

Which is 6.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's implement this code in Python.

But note that the code for count_valid must be efficient. For each position, we need to iterate over mod, tight, and allowed digits.

But with m up to 2000, and L up to 2000, the code should run in O(L * m * 10) operations. For L=2000 and m=2000, this is 2000 * 2000 * 10 = 40,000,000 operations, which is acceptable for Python in 2 seconds.

Now, let's code this.

But we need to be careful with leading zeros and the allowed digits for each position.

Also, the subtract_one function must correctly handle leading zeros.

Another possible edge case is when a is 1 followed by zeros. For example, a is '1' followed by L-1 zeros. Subtracting 1 would result in a number with L-1 digits, so the count_a_minus_1 is zero.

Implementing the subtract_one function correctly is crucial.

Now, putting it all together:

The code will be as follows.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
MOD = 10**9 +7

def subtract_one(s):

    s_list = list(s)

    i = len(s_list) -1

Third sample:

Input:

9999

a_minus_1_str is '0999', but subtract_one returns '999' (len 3). So count_a_minus_1=0.

count_b is 6.

So answer is 6.

Thus, the code should work.

Possible issues:

- Handling leading zeros in subtract_one.

- Handling the case where a is 1000 and a_minus_1 is 999 (len 3).

- In count_valid, for odd positions (must be d), and even positions (not d).

But the code seems to handle these correctly.

Thus, the code should solve the problem.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

    while i >= 0 and s_list[i] == '0':
        s_list[i] = '9'
        i -= 1
    if i < 0:
        return '0'
    s_list[i] = str(int(s_list[i]) - 1)
    new_s = ''.join(s_list)
    if new_s[0] == '0':
        new_s = new_s.lstrip('0')
        return new_s if new_s else '0'
    return new_s
