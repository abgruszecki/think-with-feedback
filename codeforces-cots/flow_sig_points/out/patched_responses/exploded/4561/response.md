<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm. The problem is asking for the number of arrays of length n where each element is less than 2^l, and the OR of all consecutive ANDs equals k. Then, we need to compute this modulo m.

First, let's understand the condition. The condition is (a1 & a2) | (a2 & a3) | ... | (a_{n-1} & a_n) = k. So all these pairwise ANDs must OR together to form exactly k.

But how do we count the arrays that satisfy this? The constraints are pretty big, especially n up to 1e18. So any O(n) approach is out of the question. We need a dynamic programming approach with matrix exponentiation or something similar that can compute the result in logarithmic time.

Let's break down the problem bit by bit. Since the OR of the ANDs is k, each bit in the binary representation of k must be set in at least one of the AND terms. Also, any bits not in k must not be set in any of the AND terms. Wait, because the OR combines all the bits. So for the OR to be exactly k, the bits set in the OR must be exactly those set in k. So any bit that's set in the OR must be in k, and all bits in k must be set in the OR.

Wait, but the OR of all the AND terms is k. So that implies that for each bit in k, at least one of the AND terms has that bit set. And for bits not in k, none of the AND terms have those bits set. Because if even one AND term has a bit set that's not in k, the OR would have that bit set, making the total larger than k, which is invalid.

So the problem splits into handling each bit independently, perhaps? But since the bits are interdependent (each pair of consecutive elements contributes to multiple bits), maybe we can model the problem by considering each bit position separately and then combining the results.

Wait, but the problem requires that all the bits in the OR are exactly those in k. So for any bit that's not in k, all the AND terms must not have that bit set. For bits in k, at least one AND term must have the bit set.

But how do we model this? Let's consider each bit position from 0 to (max_bit in l's bits minus 1). For each bit position b:

1. If the bit is set in k: Then, there must be at least one pair (a_i, a_{i+1}) such that both a_i and a_{i+1} have the b-th bit set. Because their AND would then have that bit set.

2. If the bit is not set in k: Then, for every pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), their AND must not have the b-th bit set. So for each consecutive pair, at least one of the two elements in the pair does not have the b-th bit set.

But how to combine these conditions across all bits? Since each bit is handled independently (assuming that the bits are independent), maybe we can compute the number of valid arrays for each bit and multiply them together (mod m) under the condition that the bits in k do not exceed l's allowed bits. Wait, but l can be up to 64. So each array element is less than 2^l, which means bits beyond l-1 are 0. So if k has any bits set beyond the l-th position (bit l-1 is the highest allowed), then the answer is 0. Because the array elements can't have bits higher than l-1, so their AND terms can't have those bits, making the OR of those terms also unable to have those bits. So first, check if k has any bits set beyond the l-1 position. If yes, output 0.

So first step: Check if k >= 2^l. If so, output 0.

Wait, no. Wait, l can be up to 64, so 2^l can be a very big number. But if l is 0, then all elements must be 0 (since they are less than 2^0=1, so 0). Then the AND terms are all 0, so the OR is 0. So if l is 0, then k must also be 0. Otherwise, the answer is 0. So first, handle that case.

But maybe the general approach is:

Check if k has any bits set at positions >= l. If so, then answer is 0. Because the elements are less than 2^l, so their bits are only up to l-1. So the AND of two such elements can't have any bits beyond l-1. So if k has any bits in positions >= l, the answer is 0.

So first, compute the maximum bit of k. Let's say l is given. For example, if l is 2, then the maximum bit is 1 (since 2^1=2, elements are 0,1,2,3 but less than 4). So if k has bits in positions >= l, then output 0.

So the first check: if (k >> l) > 0, then output 0.

Wait, no. Wait, if l is 2, the elements are less than 4 (2^2), so each element is up to 3 (binary 11). The AND of two elements can't have bits higher than 1 (since the elements' bits are up to 1). So if k has any bits in position >= l, then it's impossible. So the first step is to check if k has any bits set in positions >= l. If yes, output 0.

So that's the first check. If this is not satisfied, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.

Now, the problem reduces to bits 0 to l-1. For each bit, we need to process it according to whether it's set in k or not.

Now, for each bit b in 0..l-1:

Case 1: bit b is set in k. Then, in the array, there must be at least one pair (a_i, a_{i+1}) where both a_i and a_{i+1} have bit b set. Because their AND will then have bit b set, contributing to the OR.

Case 2: bit b is not set in k. Then, in all pairs (a_i, a_{i+1}), at least one of a_i or a_{i+1} must not have bit b set. Because their AND would then have bit b not set, and since the OR of all such terms must not have bit b set.

But each bit is independent, so for the total number of valid arrays, we can compute the number of arrays satisfying each bit's condition and multiply them modulo m. However, this is only possible if the bits are independent. Wait, but how? Because the array's bits for different positions are independent. For example, the presence of a certain bit in a_i does not affect other bits. So for each bit, the conditions are independent. Thus, the total number of arrays is the product of the possibilities for each bit.

So the approach is:

For each bit b from 0 to l-1:

Compute the number of ways to set the bits in the array elements such that:

- If b is in k: At least one consecutive pair has both bits set.

- If b is not in k: All consecutive pairs have at least one element with the bit unset.

Then multiply all these counts together modulo m.

But how to compute the count for each bit?

Let's model each bit independently. For each bit b, the array elements' bits for b can be considered as a sequence of 0s and 1s. Let's denote the bits of a_i for bit b as a binary sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_n.

We need to count the number of binary sequences of length n where:

Case 1 (bit in k): There exists at least one i where s_i and s_{i+1} are both 1.

Case 2 (bit not in k): For all i, s_i and s_{i+1} are not both 1.

So for each bit, we can compute the number of valid sequences (for that bit), then the total is the product of all these numbers across all bits.

Yes! Because the choices for each bit are independent. For example, for each array element, the bits for different positions can be chosen independently. So the total number of arrays is the product of the possibilities for each bit.

So now, the problem reduces to, for each bit b, compute the number of binary sequences of length n where:

If the bit is set in k (must have at least one 1-1 consecutive pair):

count_1 = total sequences where at least one pair of consecutive 1s exists.

If the bit is not set in k (must have no consecutive 1s in pairs):

count_0 = total sequences where no two consecutive 1s in pairs (i.e., for all i, s_i & s_{i+1} = 0).

Then, the answer is the product of count_1 or count_0 for each bit, depending on whether the bit is in k.

But how to compute count_0 and count_1 efficiently for each bit?

Let's start with count_0. For the case where no two consecutive 1s in any pair. So for each pair (s_i, s_{i+1}), they cannot both be 1. So the binary sequence must be such that s_i and s_{i+1} are not both 1 for any i.

This is similar to the problem of counting binary strings where no two consecutive 1s are adjacent, but here it's the pair (s_i and s_{i+1}) that cannot be both 1. Wait, no. The pair can be (1,0), (0,1), or (0,0). So the allowed transitions are from 0 to 0/1, and from 1 to 0. Because after a 1, the next element must be 0. Because 1 followed by 1 would have their AND as 1, which is forbidden.

Wait, for the case where the bit is not in k, the forbidden condition is any pair (s_i, s_{i+1}) where both are 1. So the allowed sequences are those where for every i, at least one of s_i or s_{i+1} is 0. So the consecutive pairs cannot be (1,1). So for the sequence, how many such sequences are there?

This is similar to the standard Fibonacci-like problem. Let's model this with dynamic programming. Let's consider the state as the previous element (s_{i} is 0 or 1). The transitions are:

If the previous element was 0, the next can be 0 or 1.

If the previous element was 1, the next must be 0.

So the recurrence relations are:

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1]

dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0]

The base case is for i=1: dp[1][0] = 1, dp[1][1] = 1. Wait, but the sequence length is n. Wait, for the first element, s_1 can be 0 or 1. Then for each subsequent element, the transitions follow the rules.

Wait, the number of sequences of length n where no two consecutive 1s in any pair.

Wait, let's model this as a state machine. The possible states after processing i elements are:

- The i-th element is 0.

- The i-th element is 1.

The transitions are:

From state 0:

Next can be 0 or 1.

From state 1:

Next can only be 0.

So the recurrence:

a[i] = number of sequences ending with 0.

b[i] = number of sequences ending with 1.

Then:

a[i] = a[i-1] + b[i-1]

b[i] = a[i-1]

The base case is for i=1:

a[1] = 1 (0)

b[1] = 1 (1)

Wait, but for n=1, the sequence has only one element. But in our problem, the sequences must have at least two elements? No, the problem is for n >= 2. Because the input constraints say 2 <= n <= 1e18.

Wait, n can be 1? Wait, no, the input constraints say n is at least 2. So in the problem, the array has length n >= 2. So for the count_0 case, the array length is n >=2.

So for the count_0: the total sequences is a[n] + b[n], but with the transitions as above. But for n >=2.

Wait, let's think for small n:

n=2:

Possible sequences where s_1 and s_2 are not both 1.

Possible pairs:

00 → allowed.

01 → allowed.

10 → allowed.

11 → forbidden.

So total 3 sequences.

For n=2, a[2] = a[1] + b[1] = 1 +1 = 2 (sequences ending with 0: 00, 10)

b[2] = a[1] =1 (sequences ending with 1: 01)

Total 3, which matches.

For n=3:

a[3] = a[2] + b[2] = 2 +1 =3.

b[3] = a[2] =2.

Total 5.

But the allowed sequences are:

000

001

010

100

101

So 5, which matches.

So the formula for the number of valid sequences for count_0 is a[n] + b[n] where a and b follow the recurrence above.

But for n up to 1e18, we need to compute this efficiently. So the recurrence can be represented as a matrix, and then we can use matrix exponentiation to compute a[n] and b[n] in O(log n) time.

The initial state for n=1 is a=1, b=1.

But for our problem, the array has length n >=2. Wait, but in the dynamic programming, the way we model it is for the entire array. So the count_0 for a given bit is (a[n] + b[n]) where a and b are computed for a sequence of length n.

Wait, no. Wait, the dynamic programming starts with the first element. For each position i (from 1 to n), a[i] is the count of sequences of length i ending with 0, and b[i] is the count ending with 1.

So for the count_0, the total sequences is a[n] + b[n].

So for the case where the bit is not in k, the count is a[n] + b[n], computed via matrix exponentiation.

But let's see. For example, for n=2, the count_0 is 3. Which is a[2] + b[2] = 2 +1 =3. Correct.

Now for the count_1 case: the number of sequences where at least one pair of consecutive 1s exists. Since the total possible sequences is 2^n, the count_1 is 2^n - count_0, where count_0 is the number of sequences with no consecutive 1s pairs. Because count_0 is the number of sequences where no consecutive 1s, so subtracting from the total gives the number of sequences with at least one pair.

Wait, for a single bit, each element can be 0 or 1, so for n elements, there are 2^n possible sequences. But the count_0 is the number of sequences where for all consecutive pairs (i, i+1), the pair is not (1,1). So the count_1 is 2^n - count_0.

But wait, in the count_1 scenario, the condition is that the OR of all (a_i & a_{i+1}) must have this bit set. Which requires that at least one (a_i & a_{i+1}) has the bit set. Which for the bit's binary sequence, this means that at least one pair (s_i, s_{i+1}) is (1,1). So the count_1 is exactly the number of sequences where at least one pair is (1,1).

So yes, count_1 = 2^n - count_0.

So for each bit:

if the bit is in k → count_1 = 2^n - count_0.

else → count_0.

But for the bit to be in k, the count is count_1. But how to compute this.

But wait, the count_0 is the number of sequences where no pair (1,1), and count_1 is the sequences where at least one pair exists.

But how to compute count_1 for a given n. For example, n=2, count_1 is 1 (the 11 sequence). For n=3, count_1 is total 8 sequences minus count_0 (5) → 3.

But let's see. For n=3, the sequences that have at least one pair (1,1):

Possible sequences:

110 → pairs (1,1) and (1,0) → allowed.

111 → all pairs.

101 → no consecutive 1s? The pairs are (1,0) and (0,1) → no. So 101 is allowed in count_0.

Wait, wait. For n=3, the count_0 is 5. So the count_1 is 8-5=3. Let's see:

The count_1 sequences are:

011 → pairs (0,1), (1,1) → this has a (1,1) pair.

110 → pairs (1,1), (1,0).

111 → all pairs.

But wait, 111 has two pairs: (1,1) and (1,1). So yes. So the three sequences are 011, 110, 111. That's three.

So yes, count_1 is 3 for n=3.

So the approach for a bit in k is to compute 2^n - count_0.

But for n up to 1e18, how do we compute this?

So, for each bit, we need to compute:

If the bit is in k:

ways = (2^n - fib(n)) mod m, where fib(n) is the count_0 for the bit (the number of sequences with no consecutive 1s pairs).

Else:

ways = fib(n) mod m.

But how to compute fib(n) mod m? Because the way we model the count_0 is with a recurrence relation that can be represented by a matrix, which allows us to compute it in O(log n) time.

So the recurrence for count_0 is a linear recurrence. The DP transitions can be represented as:

a[i] = a[i-1] + b[i-1]

b[i] = a[i-1]

Which can be written as a matrix:

[ a[i] ]   =   [1 1] [ a[i-1] ]

[ b[i] ]       [1 0] [ b[i-1] ]

Wait, no. Let's see:

a[i] = a[i-1] + b[i-1]

b[i] = a[i-1]

So the transition matrix would be:

| a[i] |   =   | 1  1 | * | a[i-1] |

| b[i] |       | 1  0 |   | b[i-1] |

But the initial state for i=1 is a=1, b=1 (since for n=1, the count is 1 for ending with 0 and 1 for ending with 1).

Wait, but the problem is for n >= 2. So for n=2, the count_0 is 3. So the matrix exponentiation approach can compute the a and b values for any n >= 1.

So to compute count_0 for a given n, we can model the transitions with a matrix and use fast exponentiation.

So, the matrix exponentiation approach for count_0:

The initial state for i=1 is (a=1, b=1).

The transition matrix is [[1, 1], [1, 0]].

Wait, no. Let's see:

For each step, the next a and b are computed as:

a_next = a_prev + b_prev

b_next = a_prev

So the transformation matrix is:

| a_next |   =   | 1 1 | * | a_prev |

| b_next |       | 1 0 |   | b_prev |

So the transformation matrix is [[1, 1], [1, 0]].

But to compute after (n-1) steps, since for i=1, it's the initial state, and each step increases i by 1.

So for n=1, the initial state is (a=1, b=1).

For n=2, after one step, a= 1+1=2, b=1 → total 3.

Which is correct.

So to compute the a and b for n, we need to compute the matrix raised to the (n-1)th power, multiplied by the initial vector.

So the matrix exponentiation approach would work here.

So for each bit, to compute count_0, which is a[n] + b[n], which is the same as (a_prev + b_prev) + a_prev → but I think the sum a + b can be computed as the sum of the components of the vector after (n-1) steps.

Wait, the initial vector is [a=1, b=1]. For each step, the vector is transformed.

So for n=1, the vector is (1,1). The sum is 2.

But n=1 is not allowed. So for n >=2, the sum after (n-1) steps will give a and b, which sum to the count_0.

So for each bit, the count_0 is (a + b) after (n-1) transitions.

So the steps for a bit are:

Compute the number of sequences with no consecutive 1s pairs for a bit not in k.

For a bit in k: compute 2^n - count_0.

But 2^n can be very large. However, we can compute (2^n mod m) quickly with exponentiation. But since m can be up to 1e9+7, and n is up to 1e18, we need to compute pow(2, n, m) efficiently.

So the plan for each bit is:

If the bit is not in k:

Compute count_0 = (a + b) mod m, where a and b are computed via matrix exponentiation.

If the bit is in k:

Compute total = pow(2, n, m) → total possible sequences.

count_0 = (a + b) mod m.

count_1 = (total - count_0) mod m.

Then multiply the count_1 to the result.

Now, for each bit, we need to compute these values. Since l can be up to 64 bits, but 64 is manageable even if we process each bit in O(1) steps.

So the steps are:

1. Check if k has any bits set beyond (l-1)th position. If yes, output 0.

2. For each bit from 0 to l-1:

   a. Check if the bit is set in k.

   b. Compute the number of valid sequences for this bit.

3. Multiply all these numbers modulo m.

But how to handle the matrix exponentiation for each bit?

Wait, for each bit, the count_0 depends on n. But the matrix exponentiation for count_0 is the same for all bits. Because the recurrence relation is the same regardless of the bit. So the count_0 for a given n is the same for all bits not in k. So, perhaps we can precompute the count_0 once for all bits not in k, and then compute count_1 once (for all bits in k), but wait no. Because for a bit in k, we need to compute (pow(2, n, m) - count_0) mod m. But count_0 for each bit in k is the same as for bits not in k? No, because count_0 is the same for all bits. Wait, no. For each bit, the count_0 is the same as the recurrence is the same. So, for all bits, count_0 is the same. So perhaps for all bits not in k, the count_0 is the same value, and for bits in k, the count_1 is (pow(2, n, m) - count_0) mod m.

Wait, that's possible. Because for each bit, the count_0 (the number of sequences with no consecutive 1s pairs) is the same for that bit. So for all bits not in k, their count_0 is the same value, and for all bits in k, their count_1 is (2^n - count_0) mod m.

Wait, but no. Because for each bit, the count_0 is the same, but when a bit is in k, we compute (2^number_of_bits_in_sequence - count_0). But the number of bits in the sequence is n. So 2^n is the same for all bits. So 2^n mod m is the same for all bits. So for all bits in k, their contribution is (pow(2, n, m) - count_0) mod m. And for bits not in k, their contribution is count_0.

So this suggests that we can compute count_0 once (using matrix exponentiation), compute pow_2n once (using pow(2, n, m)), and for each bit:

if in k: multiply (pow_2n - count_0) mod m

else: multiply count_0.

So this would reduce the problem to O(l) steps, each with O(1) operations, which is feasible even for l up to 64.

So the steps are:

- Check if k has any bits set beyond l-1. If yes, output 0.

- Compute pow_2n = pow(2, n, m).

- Compute count_0 (number of sequences with no consecutive 1s) mod m.

- Compute count_1 = (pow_2n - count_0) % m.

- For each bit in 0..l-1:

   if bit is set in k: multiply the result by count_1 mod m.

   else: multiply the result by count_0 mod m.

But wait, for the bits not in k, we multiply by count_0. For bits in k, multiply by count_1.

Now, the problem is how to compute count_0 mod m.

The count_0 is the number of sequences of length n where no two consecutive 1s in any pair. Which can be computed via matrix exponentiation.

The matrix exponentiation for count_0 is as follows:

The recurrence is:

a[i] = a[i-1] + b[i-1]

b[i] = a[i-1]

The initial state is a=1, b=1 for i=1.

We need to compute the state for i =n, which requires (n-1) transitions.

But n can be up to 1e18. So we need to represent the transitions as a matrix and use exponentiation to compute the result in O(log n) time.

So the matrix exponentiation for this recurrence.

The transition matrix M is:

[ [1, 1], 

  [1, 0] ]

The initial vector is [a, b] = [1, 1].

The matrix is raised to the (n-1)th power and multiplied by the initial vector.

The resulting vector [a, b] gives a and b for i =n. The sum a + b is count_0.

But how to compute this matrix exponentiation mod m.

Yes. So the code for this would involve matrix exponentiation, considering the modulus m.

So the code steps:

Compute M^(n-1), multiply by the initial vector [1, 1], sum the components mod m.

So the code can be written as follows:

Implement a function to compute the matrix exponentiation, then multiply by the initial vector.

Alternatively, since the state is a linear combination, perhaps we can represent this with a function that computes the count_0 given n and m.

But for the purposes of this problem, let's model this.

So, the matrix exponentiation part:

The matrix is [[1, 1], [1, 0]].

We need to compute the matrix raised to the (n-1)th power.

Let's denote the matrix as M.

The initial vector is [a1, b1] = [1, 1].

After multiplying by M once, we get:

a2 = a1*1 + b1*1 = 1+1=2.

b2 = a1*1 + b1*0 =1.

So for n=2, the sum is 2+1=3, which is correct.

So for M^(n-1) multiplied by [1, 1], the resulting vector is [a_n, b_n], and count_0 = (a_n + b_n) mod m.

So the code can compute this.

Thus, the steps are:

Compute count_0 = (a_n + b_n) mod m.

Compute pow_2n = pow(2, n, m).

Then for each bit in 0..l-1:

Check if the bit is set in k.

If yes, multiply the result by (pow_2n - count_0) mod m.

Else, multiply by count_0 mod m.

But wait, for the case where the bit is in k, the count is (pow_2n - count_0) mod m. However, if pow_2n < count_0 mod m, then the subtraction will result in a negative number. So we need to add m and then take mod m again to ensure it's positive.

So (pow_2n - count_0 + m) % m.

But in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers correctly, but to be safe, adding m before taking mod is better.

Now, putting it all together.

First, check if k has any bit set at position >= l. If l is 0, then all elements must be zero. So the OR of the AND terms is zero. So if k is not zero, the answer is zero. Else, there's one array (all zeros), but since the array length is at least 2, but the elements are all zero. So the OR would be zero. But if l is zero, then all elements are zero. So the OR is zero. So in this case, if k is zero, and l is zero, the answer is 1 (if n >=2). But if l is zero and k is not zero, output zero.

Wait, but l can be zero. For example, in the input where l=0, the elements are required to be less than 2^0=1, so all elements are zero. Then, the AND terms are all zero, so the OR is zero. So in this case, if k is zero, then the answer is 1 (only possible array is all zeros). Otherwise, answer is zero.

So the first step is to check if k >= 2^l. Wait, but when l is 64, 2^l is a very big number (but in Python, that's manageable). Alternatively, we can check if the highest bit set in k is >= l. So, if l is 0, then 2^l is 1, and any k >=1 will have output zero.

Alternatively, for all bits b >= l, if any is set in k, then the answer is zero.

So the code can check:

if any of the bits in k from position l onwards is set. For example, if l is 3, then bits 3 and higher must be zero in k. Otherwise, output zero.

So, how to compute that. For example, if l is 0, then 2^l is 1, and if k is >=1, then output zero. For l=0, the maximum allowed element is 0, so the AND terms are all zero. So the OR is zero. So if k is not zero, output zero. Else, the answer is 1 if n >=2. Wait, but n is at least 2 according to the input constraints. So for l=0 and k=0, the answer is 1. Otherwise, zero.

So the code can handle this case.

But for general l, the code can check if (k >> l) > 0. If so, output zero.

So:

if (l < 64 and k >= (1 << l)) or (l == 64 and k > 0):

    output 0.

Wait, but 2^64 is a very big number. However, in Python, shifting 1 left by 64 is possible.

Alternatively, for l up to 64, if l is 64, then the maximum possible element is 2^64 -1 (but elements must be less than 2^64). So the bits allowed are up to 63. So if l is 64, then the highest allowed bit is 63. So any bit set in k at position >=64 is not possible. But since k is up to 1e18, which is about 60 bits, but for l=64, the check is k >= 2^64? Wait, no. Because l=64, the elements are less than 2^64. So their bits can be up to 63. So the AND terms can have bits up to 63. So if k has any bits >= 64, output zero. But since k is up to 1e18, which is 60 bits, but for l=64, the maximum possible bit in k is 63 (since 2^63 is about 9e18, but 1e18 is less than that). So for l=64, the check is whether k has any bits set beyond 63. So (k >> 64) >0. But in Python, when l is 64, (k >> l) will be zero unless k is >= 2^64.

But for l=64, the maximum allowed elements are up to 2^64-1. So their AND terms can't have bits higher than 63, because (2^64-1) & (2^64-1) is 2^64-1, but the highest bit is 63. So for l=64, the bits in k must be 0-63. So if k has any bit set at positions >=64, then output zero.

So the code can check:

if (k >> l) != 0:

    print(0)

    exit()

Else, proceed.

But for l=64, shifting by l (64) is possible, but when k is up to 1e18, which is 60 bits, (k >>64) is zero. So the check is safe.

So code:

if l == 0:

    if k ==0:

        print(1 % m)

    else:

        print(0)

    exit()

else:

    if (k >> l) > 0:

        print(0)

        exit()

But wait, if l is zero, then elements are zero. So their AND terms are zero. So OR is zero. So if k is zero, the answer is 1. But n is at least 2. So the array is [0,0,...,0], which has (n-1) AND terms, all zero. OR is zero. So yes.

So code:

if l ==0:

    if k ==0:

        print(1 % m)

    else:

        print(0)

    exit()

else:

    max_bit = (1 << l) -1

    if k > max_bit:

        print(0)

        exit()

Wait, but (1 << l) is 2^l. So for l=64, 1 << l would be 1 << 64 which is 18446744073709551616. So max_bit is (1 << l) -1. Then, if k > max_bit → output 0.

But in Python, for large l like 64, 1 << l can be computed as a large integer. So this approach is correct.

But for l=64, 1 << l is 2^64. So for k >= 2^64, the output is zero. Otherwise, proceed.

So code:

if l ==0:

    if k ==0:

        print(1 % m)

    else:

        print(0)

    exit()

if k >= (1 << l):

    print(0)

    exit()

So now, after passing these checks, we proceed.

Now, compute count_0 (number of sequences for a bit not in k), which is the number of sequences of length n with no consecutive 1s pairs.

But for n up to 1e18, compute this via matrix exponentiation.

The matrix is [[1, 1], [1, 0]].

The initial vector is [a, b] = [1, 1].

We need to compute M^(n-1) * [a, b], then sum the components.

But implementing matrix exponentiation for this case.

Alternatively, since it's a 2x2 matrix, we can represent it as a tuple of tuples, and implement matrix multiplication and exponentiation.

But perhaps there's a way to compute this using fast exponentiation of the matrix, considering the modulus.

So, let's write a function that computes the matrix to the power (n-1) mod m, then multiply it by the initial vector.

Alternatively, since the state is a vector of two elements, we can model the exponentiation as a linear recurrence, and find a way to compute a and b directly.

But let's proceed with the matrix approach.

For example, the code can have a function matrix_pow that takes a matrix and an exponent, and returns the matrix raised to that power, mod m.

Then, multiply the resulting matrix by the initial vector.

But perhaps it's more efficient to represent the matrix multiplication in terms of the a and b variables.

Alternatively, here's another approach:

The recurrence can be modeled as a linear recurrence. The count_0 for n is equal to the (n+2)th Fibonacci number. Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Wait, for count_0 for n=2 →3, n=3→5, n=4→8, etc. Which looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted. Because 3, 5, 8, 13... So it's like Fibonacci numbers starting from 3.

The Fibonacci sequence starts as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..., but here we have for n=2 →3, which is Fib(4) =3. For n=3→5 (Fib(5)), etc. So perhaps count_0(n) = Fib(n+1), but with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, etc.

Wait, let's see:

n=1 → a=1, b=1 → sum 2.

But for the problem, n is >=2. For n=2, sum is 3 → which is Fib(4) if Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3.

Yes. So count_0(n) = Fib(n+2) ?

Wait, n=2 → count_0=3=Fib(4).

n=3 →5=Fib(5).

n=4→8=Fib(6).

So yes, count_0(n) is Fib(n+2), where Fib(1) =1, Fib(2)=1.

So this suggests that count_0(n) is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number.

Thus, the problem reduces to computing the (n+2)th Fibonacci number mod m.

But how to compute that quickly for large n.

Yes, using matrix exponentiation again, but for Fibonacci numbers.

But since we're already using matrix exponentiation for the same purpose, perhaps we can model it as a Fibonacci sequence.

So, Fib(n) can be computed in O(log n) time using matrix exponentiation.

So, if count_0(n) is Fib(n+1), wait no. Wait, for n=2, count_0 is 3, which is Fib(4). So Fib(4) is 3.

So the formula is count_0(n) = Fib(n+2), where Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3) =2, Fib(4)=3, etc.

So to compute count_0(n), we need to compute Fib(n+2) mod m.

But how to compute Fib(n+2) mod m.

So the code can compute this via fast doubling or matrix exponentiation.

Thus, the code can compute Fib(n+2) mod m, and that will be count_0.

But wait, the initial state is a=1, b=1 for n=1, which sum to 2. Fib(3) is 2, which corresponds to n=1. Then for n=2, the sum is 3 → Fib(4)=3. So yes, count_0(n) = Fib(n+2).

So for example:

n = 2 → Fib(4) =3.

Yes.

So the code can compute Fib(n+2) mod m.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) =1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.

But wait, this depends on the definition. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a different indexing.

But in any case, the code can compute the nth Fibonacci number using fast doubling.

The fast doubling method allows computing Fib(n) in O(log n) time.

So the code can use the fast doubling algorithm to compute Fib(n+2) mod m.

But let's check:

For n=2: Fib(4) = 3.

For n=3: Fib(5) =5.

Which matches the earlier examples.

So, the code can use fast doubling to compute Fib(n+2) mod m.

Thus, the code can compute count_0 as Fib(n+2) mod m.

But how to implement fast doubling in Python.

Yes.

The fast doubling algorithm uses the following identities:

Fib(2n-1) = Fib(n)^2 + Fib(n-1)^2

Fib(2n) = Fib(n) * (2*Fib(n-1) + Fib(n))

The code can recursively compute this.

Alternatively, here's an iterative version of the fast doubling algorithm.

But given that n can be up to 1e18+2, we need an efficient implementation.

An implementation of fast doubling is as follows:

def fib(n, m):

    a, b = 0, 1

    for bit in bin(n)[2:]:

        c = a * ((2*b - a) % m)

        d = (a*a + b*b) % m

        if bit == '1':

            a, b = d, (c + d) % m

        else:

            a, b = c, d

    return a

But I need to test this.

Alternatively, here's a better approach using the recursive fast doubling method.

But perhaps the best way is to use the fast doubling algorithm to compute Fib(n) mod m.

Alternatively, here's code for fast doubling:

def fib(n, m):

    def fib_pair(n):

        if n == 0:

            return (0, 1)

        a, b = fib_pair(n >> 1)

        c = a * ((2*b - a) % m)

        d = (a*a + b*b) % m

        if n & 1:

            return (d, (c + d) % m)

        else:

            return (c, d)

    return fib_pair(n)[0]

Wait, this function returns Fib(n) mod m.

So, for example:

fib(4, 10) → Fib(4) is 3 → returns 3.

Yes.

So, for count_0(n) = Fib(n+2, m).

So, the code can compute count_0 = fib(n+2, m).

Thus, this would replace the matrix exponentiation approach.

This is more efficient and easier to code.

Thus, for the code:

count_0 = fib(n+2, m) % m

pow_2n = pow(2, n, m)

count_1 = (pow_2n - count_0) % m

Then, for each bit from 0 to l-1:

if the bit is set in k:

    res = (res * count_1) % m

else:

    res = (res * count_0) % m

But what if m is 1? Then all results are zero. But according to the input constraints, m >= 1. So modulo 1 would give zero.

But the problem says m can be 1.

So the code must handle that.

But let's proceed.

So, the steps:

- Check if k has any bits set beyond l-1 → output 0.

- Compute count_0 = fib(n+2, m) % m.

- Compute pow_2n = pow(2, n, m).

- Compute count_1 = (pow_2n - count_0) % m.

- For each bit from 0 to l-1:

   if the bit is set in k → multiply res by count_1.

   else → multiply by count_0.

But how to check if the bit is set in k.

For example, loop over all bits from 0 to l-1, check if k has that bit set.

But wait, k can have bits set beyond l-1, but we already checked that and output zero.

So, in the loop for bits from 0 to l-1:

For each bit in this range, check if it is set in k.

So, in code:

result = 1 % m

for b in range(l):

    if (k >> b) & 1:

        result = (result * count_1) % m

    else:

        result = (result * count_0) % m

So this loop runs l times.

But what if l is 0? But we already handled the l=0 case earlier.

Thus, putting it all together.

Now, the code:

But first, implement the fib function.

Wait, but when n+2 is very large (up to 1e18 + 2), and m can be up to 1e9+7, the fib function needs to be efficient.

But the fast doubling method is O(log n), which is acceptable.

So the code can be written as follows.

But let's handle the cases:

First, handle l=0.

Then, check if k >= 2^l.

Then, compute count_0 and count_1.

Then, multiply the results for each bit.

But wait, when l=64, shifting 1 by 64 is 18446744073709551616, but in Python, shifting 1 to 64 is allowed.

Thus, the code:

Read n, k, l, m.

if l ==0:

    if k ==0:

        print(1 % m)

    else:

        print(0)

    exit()

max_bit = (1 << l) -1

if k > max_bit:

    print(0)

    exit()

# Now compute count_0 = fib(n+2) mod m.

def fast_doubling_fib(n, mod):

    def fib_pair(n):

        if n == 0:

            return (0, 1)

        a, b = fib_pair(n >> 1)

        c = a * ((2*b - a) % mod)

        d = (a*a + b*b) % mod

        if n & 1:

            return (d, (c + d) % mod)

        else:

            return (c, d)

    return fib_pair(n)[0]

count_0 = fast_doubling_fib(n+2, m) % m

pow_2n = pow(2, n, m)

count_1 = (pow_2n - count_0) % m

result = 1

for b in range(l):

    if (k >> b) & 1:

        result = (result * count_1) % m

    else:

        result = (result * count_0) % m

print(result % m)

But wait, what if m is 1? Then everything mod 1 is zero. So for m=1, the answer is zero.

But the code handles that.

Now, let's test the code against the examples.

First example:

Input:

2 1 2 10

n=2, k=1, l=2, m=10.

Check k=1 is <= 2^2-1=3 → ok.

count_0 is fib(4) mod 10.

Fib(4) is 3 → 3 mod10 is 3.

pow_2n=2^2=4 mod10 →4.

count_1 = (4 -3) mod10 →1.

Bits in k=1 are 0 (binary 01).

Loop over b=0 and 1 (since l=2).

For b=0: (k >>0)&1 →1 → multiply by 1.

For b=1: (k >>1)&1 →0 → multiply by 3.

Result is 1 * 1 *3 =3 mod10 →3. Which matches the first example.

Second example:

Input:

2 1 1 3.

l=1. max_bit is 1. k=1 is ok.

count_0 = fib(4) mod3.

Fib(4) is 3 mod3=0.

pow_2n=4 mod3=1.

count_1 = 1-0 mod3=1.

Loop over bits 0 (l=1).

bit 0 is set. So multiply result by 1.

Result is 1 mod3 →1.

Which matches the second example.

Third example:

input:

3 3 2 10.

k=3, l=2. max_bit is 3. k=3 is ok.

count_0 is fib(5) mod10.

Fib(5) is 5 mod10=5.

pow_2n=8 mod10=8.

count_1=8-5=3 mod10=3.

Now, k is 3 → binary 11. So bits 0 and 1 are set.

So loop for bits 0 and 1 (l=2).

For each bit:

bit 0: set → multiply by 3.

bit 1: set → multiply by 3.

Result is 3 *3 =9 mod10 →9. Which matches the third example.

So the code works for the examples.

Now, edge cases.

Test case where l=64 and k=0. Then, all bits are not set in k. So each bit contributes count_0. But for l=64, and each bit, count_0 is fib(n+2) mod m. So the result is count_0^64 mod m.

Another test case where k has a bit set that is not allowed.

For example, l=2, k=4 (binary 100). Then, since 2^2=4, max_bit is 3. 4 >3 → output 0.

Yes.

Thus, the code seems correct.
