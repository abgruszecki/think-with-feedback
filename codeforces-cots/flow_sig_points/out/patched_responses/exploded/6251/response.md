<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if the first card beats the second card based on the given rules. Let's think about the conditions here.

First, the problem says that a card can beat another if either of two conditions is met. The first condition is that both cards have the same suit and the first's rank is higher. The second condition is that the first card is a trump and the second is not. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Oh right. The first card (the one that's trying to beat) must be either a trump when the second is not, or both have the same suit and the first's rank is higher. So, if the first is a trump and the second is not, then yes. If both are trumps, then the first's rank must be higher. If they are of the same non-trump suit, then the first's rank must be higher. Otherwise, if the first is not a trump and the second is, then no. Also, if they are different suits and neither is the trump, then no.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if the first card's suit is the trump suit and the second's is not. If so, yes.
2. If both are trumps: then check if the first's rank is higher than the second's. If yes, then yes.
3. If neither is trump but they have the same suit: check ranks. If first's rank is higher, yes.
4. All other cases: no.

Wait, wait. Let me rephrase. The first card can beat the second if:

Either:
a) The first card is a trump (suit equals trump) and the second is not. Then regardless of ranks, yes.

OR

b) Both cards have the same suit (could be any, including trump?), and the first's rank is higher than the second's. Wait, but if both are trumps, then same suit, so check rank. If first's rank is higher, then yes. But if one is trump and the other isn't, but same suit? Wait, that's impossible. Because if the first is a trump, then its suit is the trump suit. The second can't have the same suit unless it's also a trump. Because, for example, if trump is H, then any card with suit H is a trump. So if first is H (trump) and second is H, then they are both trumps. So in that case, their ranks must be compared.

So the condition for a) is: first is trump, second is not. Then yes.

Otherwise, if the first and second have the same suit (could be non-trump or both trump), then check if the first's rank is higher. If yes, then yes.

Otherwise, no.

So the steps to check are:

Check if first is a trump and second is not. If yes, return YES.

Else, check if the suits of both are the same. If yes, then compare ranks. If first's rank is higher, return YES.

Otherwise, return NO.

So, the plan is:

- Determine the ranks of the two cards. Need to have an order for the ranks. The order is given as increasing: "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A". So the highest is A, then K, etc. So the list is [6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A]. Wait, but the order is in increasing order. So 6 is the lowest, A is the highest. So when comparing, for example, if first's rank is higher than second's, then yes.

So create a dictionary to map each rank to its index. Then higher index means higher rank.

Then:

First, get the trump suit.

Read the two cards.

Check if first is trump and second is not: then return YES.

Else, check if the suits are the same. If so, compare their ranks. If first's rank is higher than second's: return YES.

Else, return NO.

So the code structure would be:

trump_suit = input().strip()

card1, card2 = input().split()

rank_order = {'6':0, '7':1, '8':2, '9':3, 'T':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'K':7, 'A':8}

suit1 = card1[1]
suit2 = card2[1]

rank1 = card1[0]
rank2 = card2[0]

if (suit1 == trump_suit and suit2 != trump_suit):
    print("YES")
elif (suit1 == suit2):
    if rank_order[rank1] > rank_order[rank2]:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
else:
    print("NO")

Wait, but what if both are trumps? Then suit1 and suit2 are both trump. So the elif condition is triggered. Then compare ranks. So that's correct.

Yes. Because in that case, both are trumps, same suit. So their ranks must be compared. If first's rank is higher, then it's a YES.

So this code should handle all cases.

Let's check the examples.

First example:

Input:

H

QH 9S

trump is H.

card1 is QH: suit is H (trump). card2 is 9S: suit S (not trump). So first is trump, second not. So YES.

Second example:

Input:

S

8D 6D

trump is S.

card1 is 8D (suit D, which is not trump). card2 is 6D (same suit D). Compare ranks: 8 has higher index (2) than 6 (0). So 8D beats 6D. Output YES.

Third example:

Input:

C

7H AS

trump is C.

card1 is 7H (suit H, not trump). card2 is AS (suit S, not trump). Suits are different. So no. Output NO.

Which matches the examples.

So the code should work.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

We can read the first line as trump = input().strip()

Then, the second line is split into two parts.

Then, for each card, the first character is the rank, second is the suit.

The code would be straightforward.

Also, we need to handle the case where the two cards are different (but according to the problem statement, the input has two different cards, so perhaps that's not a concern for us. The code doesn't need to check that.)

So code steps:

Read the trump.

Read the two cards.

Extract suit and rank for each.

Check the conditions as above.

Yes.

Now, in terms of optimization: since the code is O(1), there's nothing to optimize. The code is already optimal.

So the code should be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    trump = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    card1, card2 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()

    rank_order = {'6':0, '7':1, '8':2, '9':3, 'T':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'K':7, 'A':8}

    s1, r1 = card1[1], card1[0]
    s2, r2 = card2[1], card2[0]

    # Check if first is trump and second is not
    if s1 == trump and s2 != trump:
        print("YES", file=output_stream)
    elif s1 == s2:
        # same suit, compare ranks
        if rank_order[r1] > rank_order[r2]:
            print("YES", file=output_stream)
        else:
            print("NO", file=output_stream)
    else:
        print("NO", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

8D 6D
""",
            "output": \
"""\

""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    trump = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    card1, card2 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()

    rank_order = {'6':0, '7':1, '8':2, '9':3, 'T':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'K':7, 'A':8}

    s1, r1 = card1[1], card1[0]
    s2, r2 = card2[1], card2[0]

    # Check if first is trump and second is not
    if s1 == trump and s2 != trump:
        print("YES", file=output_stream)
    elif s1 == s2:
        # same suit, compare ranks
        if rank_order[r1] > rank_order[r2]:
            print("YES", file=output_stream)
        else:
            print("NO", file=output_stream)
    else:
        print("NO", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
C
7H AS
""",
            "output": \
"""\
NO
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Third example: trump is C.

card1 is 7H (s1=H), card2 is AS (s2=S). s1 != s2, and neither is trump. So output NO.

Yes.

So this code should handle all cases.

```python
trump = input().strip()
c1, c2 = input().split()
order = {'6':0, '7':1, '8':2, '9':3, 'T':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'K':7, 'A':8}
s1, r1 = c1[1], c1[0]
s2, r2 = c2[1], c2[0]

if (s1 == trump and s2 != trump) or (s1 == s2 and order[r1] > order[r2]):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
