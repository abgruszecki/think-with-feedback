<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a given number into a specific financial format. Let's read the problem carefully and figure out what steps I need to take.

First, let's understand the requirements. The financial format has several rules:

1. The number is split into integer and fractional parts, separated by a dot. The fractional part must have exactly two digits. If there's more, we truncate. If less, add zeros.
2. The integer part must have commas separating groups of three digits starting from the right. Like 12,345,678.
3. If the original number is negative, we put it in parentheses, and the dollar sign is inside. Otherwise, it's outside. But the minus sign isn't written; instead, the parentheses indicate the negative.
4. The dollar sign is added at the beginning (inside the parentheses if negative).

Hmm. So first, I need to process the input number into these parts. Let's break down the steps.

First, check if the input starts with a '-'. That determines if we need parentheses later.

Next, split the number into the integer and fractional parts. The input may or may not have a decimal point.

For example:
- "2012" becomes integer "2012", fractional part "00".
- "0.000" becomes integer "0", fractional "000" → but we take two digits, so "00".
- "-0.00987654321" → integer part "0" (since after the decimal, it's 009...), fractional part "0098..." → take first two digits: "00".

Wait, the problem says that the fractional part is handled by truncating to two digits. So regardless of how many digits after the decimal, we take the first two. So for "0.000", the fractional part is "00" (since we take first two, which are 00, then pad if needed? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: if the original has less than two digits, we add zeros. So for example, if the input is "0.1", then the fractional part is "10"? Or wait, the problem says:

In the financial format, the fractional part must have exactly two digits. So if the initial number has less than two digits, pad with zeros. If it has more, discard the extra (no rounding). So for example:

Input "0.000" → fractional part is "000". Truncated to two digits would be "00", but since the problem says that if it has more, we discard the extra. So in this case, after splitting on the decimal, the fractional part is the first two digits of whatever is there. Wait, but the example input "0.000" outputs "0.00". Let's look at the second sample input:

Input: 0.000 → Output: $0.00. So even though the input has three zeros after decimal, we take two. Wait, but the input's fractional part is "000", but the problem says that if the fractional part has more than two, we just take the first two. So yes. So for the input "0.000", the fractional part is "00".

Another example: input "0.1" → fractional part is "10" (pad with a zero). Input "0.9" → "90". Input "0.99" → "99". Input "0.999" → "99".

So the steps for processing the fractional part are:

- Split the number into integer and fractional parts. If there's no decimal point, the fractional part is empty (so we add two zeros). If there is a decimal point, take the fractional part as whatever comes after it, up to two characters (if longer than two, truncate to first two; if shorter, pad with zeros on the right to make two digits).

Wait, but truncating might involve taking the first two digits, regardless of rounding. So for example, "0.987" → fractional part is "98", not rounded to 99.

So how to split the input into integer and fractional parts:

First, check if the input contains a '.'.

Case 1: No '.' → integer part is entire number (except possible minus), fractional part is empty.

Case 2: There's a '.' → split into integer_part and fractional_part. The fractional_part is the part after the '.'.

Then, process the fractional part to two digits: take first two characters, if longer than two, truncate. If shorter than two, pad with zeros to the right.

So for example, input "123.4" → fractional part is "4", pad with one zero → "40".

Now for the integer part. The integer part is to be formatted with commas separating groups of three digits, starting from the right. For example, 12345678 becomes 12,345,678.

How to process the integer part:

- Remove any leading zeros? No. Wait, the problem states that the input's integer part is either a single zero or doesn't have leading zeros. But when processing the integer part, we need to split into groups of three from the right.

So for example:

Input is "0" → integer part is "0" → formatted as "0".

Input is "12345678" → split into groups 12,345,678.

So the approach is to reverse the integer string, then split into chunks of three, then reverse each chunk, then join with commas.

Wait, for example:

Original integer part: 12345678 → reversed is 87654321.

Split into groups of three from the left (since reversed, the original is split from the right). So 87654 becomes 87, 654, 321? Wait, no. Let's think:

Original: 12345678 → split into 12,345,678. So the steps would be:

Take the integer part as "12345678".

Reverse it: "87654321".

Split into groups of three:

"87654321" → when split into groups of three, starting from the left:

Group 1: 876 → but reversed, this is 678.

Group 2: 543 → reversed is 345.

Group 3: 21 → reversed is 12.

Wait, no. Let's see. The reversed string is "87654321". Let's split into chunks of three, but starting from the beginning (left) of the reversed string.

So first three digits: 876 → which when reversed back becomes 678. Then the next three digits: 543 → reversed back is 345. Then the next two digits: 21 → reversed back is 12. So when we put them together, it's 12,345,678.

So the approach is:

- Reverse the integer part string.
- Split into chunks of three, starting from the left (so first three characters, then next three, etc.).
- For each chunk, reverse it again to get the original order.
- Join with commas.

But how to split the reversed string into chunks of three, starting from the left? For example, for reversed string "87654321":

Split into 876,543,21? Then each chunk is reversed to 678, 345, 12 → so the commas are 12,345,678.

So the code steps:

Take the integer part as a string (without leading minus, since the minus is handled separately).

Reverse it, then process in groups of three. Let's see:

For example, integer_part_str = '12345678'

reversed_str = '87654321'

Then, split into groups:

index 0: 876 (length 3), index 3:543 (length 3), index 6:21 (length 2).

So reversed_groups = ['876', '543', '21']

Then, reverse each group and join:

group[0][::-1] → '678', group[1][::-1] → '345', group[2][::-1] → '12'

Join with commas → 12,345,678.

So the code would be:

def format_integer_part(s):

    reversed_s = s[::-1]

    groups = []

    for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

        group = reversed_s[i:i+3]

        groups.append(group[::-1])

    # reverse the groups and join with commas

    return ','.join(reversed(groups))

Wait, no. Wait, the groups are in reversed order. Because when you split the reversed string into chunks of three, the first chunk corresponds to the last three digits of the original. So when you reverse each group, and then reverse the list of groups, then join with commas.

Wait, let's see for the example:

groups after splitting reversed_str '87654321' into 3-character chunks:

groups would be ['876', '543', '21']

each group is reversed to '678', '345', '12'

then reverse the list of groups → ['12', '345', '678']

join with commas → '12,345,678' → correct.

So the code would be:

groups = [reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1] for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3)]

then reversed_groups = groups[::-1]

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Original integer part is '12345678'.

Reversed string is '87654321'.

Split into chunks of 3 from left (i=0, 3, 6):

i=0 → 876 → reversed is 678 → group 678

i=3 → 543 → reversed is 345 → group 345

i=6 → 21 → reversed is 12 → group 12

groups = ['678', '345', '12']

Then, when we reverse this list → ['12', '345', '678'], join with commas → '12,345,678'.

Ah, right. So the code would be:

reversed_s = s[::-1]

groups = []

for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

    group = reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1]  # reverse back the chunk

    groups.append(group)

groups = groups[::-1]  # reverse the list to get the correct order

formatted_integer = ','.join(groups)

Wait, but groups after the for loop would be ['678', '345', '12']. Reversed groups would be ['12', '345', '678'] → joined gives '12,345,678'.

Yes. So that's the approach.

But what if the original integer part is shorter than 3 digits? Like '123' → reversed '321', split into one group of 3, reversed back to '123' → groups list is ['123'], reversed groups list is ['123'] → joined as '123'.

Another example: '1234' → reversed is '4321'. Split into i=0 (432), and i=3 (1). The groups would be:

i=0: '432' → reversed to '234'

i=3: '1' → reversed to '1'

groups list is ['234', '1'], reversed to ['1', '234'] → joined as '1,234'.

Yes. So this approach works.

So the code for formatting the integer part is as described.

Now, the steps for the problem:

1. Parse the input into sign, integer_part, fractional_part.

   - Check if the input starts with '-'. If so, the sign is negative. The rest is the number (without the '-').

   - Split the number into integer and fractional parts.

   - For example:

      Input: '-12345678.9' → sign is negative, integer_part '12345678', fractional_part '9'.

2. Process the fractional part:

   - If the fractional part is present (i.e., input has '.'), take the first two digits. If it's longer than two, truncate. If shorter than two, pad with zeros to make two.

   - If no fractional part (no '.'), then it's treated as two zeros.

   So:

   For input '2012' → fractional is '00'.

3. Process the integer part as per the commas.

4. Combine the formatted integer, '.', and the processed fractional part.

5. Add the sign (as per parentheses and $):

   - If the original number is negative, wrap the $ and number in parentheses.

   - Else, prepend $.

Examples:

Sample input 3: '-0.00987654321' → original sign is negative.

Integer part is '0', fractional is '0098...' → truncate to first two digits → '00'.

Formatted as '0.00'.

So the formatted number is '$0.00' but since original is negative, output is '($0.00)'.

So the steps:

After processing, the formatted string (integer + . + fractional) is '0.00'.

Then, check if original sign is negative → wrap in parentheses and add $ inside.

So the final output is '($0.00)'.

Now, let's outline the code steps:

Read the input as a string.

Check if it starts with '-', if so, set sign to negative, and process the rest of the string. Else, sign is positive.

Split into integer_part and fractional_part:

if '.' in s:

   split into parts.

else:

   integer_part is the entire string (after removing sign), fractional_part is ''

Process the fractional_part:

if len(fractional_part) >= 2 → take first two characters.

else → take fractional_part + '0' * (2 - len(fractional_part)).

So:

fractional = (fractional_part[:2] if len(fractional_part) >=2 else fractional_part.ljust(2, '0'))

Wait, but what if the fractional_part is shorter than two digits. For example, input is '0.1' → fractional_part is '1' → so after processing, it becomes '10'.

So yes, fractional_processed = fractional_part.ljust(2, '0')[:2]

But wait, ljust pads to the right. So if the fractional_part is '9', then .ljust(2, '0') gives '90'.

But if the fractional_part is longer than 2, like '987', then we take first two.

So:

fractional_processed = (fractional_part[:2] if len(fractional_part) >=2 else fractional_part + '0' * (2 - len(fractional_part)))

Alternatively, can do: fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]

But that's not correct. For example, fractional_part is '9' → '9' + '00' → '900' → first two characters '90' → correct.

If fractional_part is '123' → first two is '12' → correct.

If fractional_part is 'a', but wait, the input is correct, per the problem statement.

So this approach works.

So code:

if '.' in s:

   integer_str, fractional_str = s.split('.', 1)

else:

   integer_str = s

   fractional_str = ''

But wait, after handling the sign. For example, if the input is '-123.45', after removing the '-', the integer_str would be '123', fractional_str '45'.

Wait, no. Let's split the processing:

Original input is something like '-1234.56' → after checking the sign, the rest is '1234.56'. Then splitting into integer and fractional parts.

Wait, wait. Let's process the sign first.

So:

s = input().strip()

sign = 1

if s.startswith('-'):

   sign = -1

   num_str = s[1:]

else:

   num_str = s

So the rest is num_str, which is the number without the sign.

Then, split num_str into integer and fractional parts.

So:

if '.' in num_str:

   integer_part, fractional_part = num_str.split('.', 1)

else:

   integer_part = num_str

   fractional_part = ''

Then process fractional_part:

fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]

Wait, but fractional_part may be empty. For example, if the input is '123', then fractional_part is empty. So '00'[:2] → '00'.

If input is '0.000', then fractional_part is '000' → ( '000' + '00') → '00000' → first two characters '00'.

If input is '0.9', fractional_part is '9' → ( '9' + '00') → '900' → first two '90'.

So this approach works.

Yes. So fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]

Then, process the integer_part.

Now, the integer_part could be '0' (like in input '0.000'), which is allowed.

So, for the integer_part, we need to split into groups of three.

But what if the integer_part is '0' → formatted as '0'.

Else, process as per the groups.

So code for formatting the integer part:

def format_integer(integer_part):

    if len(integer_part) == 0:

        return '0'

    reversed_part = integer_part[::-1]

    groups = []

    for i in range(0, len(reversed_part), 3):

        group = reversed_part[i:i+3][::-1]

        groups.append(group)

    groups = groups[::-1]

    return ','.join(groups)

Wait, let's test this with some examples.

Test case 1: '12345678' → reversed_part is '87654321'

i=0 → 876 → [::-1] → '678'

i=3 → 543 → '345'

i=6 → 21 → '12'

groups after loop: ['678', '345', '12']

reverse groups → ['12', '345', '678'] → joined → '12,345,678'.

Test case 2: '0' → reversed_part is '0'.

i=0 → group '0' → groups is ['0'], reversed → ['0'] → joined → '0'.

Test case 3: '1234' → reversed_part '4321'.

i=0 → 432 → reversed '234'

i=3 → 1 → '1'

groups after loop → ['234', '1'] → reversed → ['1', '234'] → joined → '1,234'.

Test case 4: '123' → reversed '321' → group '321' reversed → '123' → groups ['123'] → reversed → ['123'] → '123'.

So this function works.

So code for the integer part:

integer_part = integer_part or '0'  # in case it's empty? but according to problem statement, the input has at least one digit.

Wait, the problem says that the input contains at least one decimal digit, so the integer_part after splitting can't be empty. Because if the input is something like '.5', then according to the problem's constraints, this is invalid. Wait, the problem says that if a '.' is present, it's preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity of digits. So, the input can't be '.5' or '5.'.

So the code can assume that the integer_part is non-empty.

So no need to handle that case.

So proceed.

Once the integer_part is formatted with commas, combine with the fractional_processed to make the main part of the output.

So formatted_number = formatted_integer + '.' + fractional_processed.

Then, add the $ sign and parentheses as per the sign.

If sign is -1:

   output is '($' + formatted_number + ')'

else:

   output is '$' + formatted_number.

Wait, no. Let's check the sample input 3:

Input: '-0.00987654321' → sign is -1.

formatted integer is '0', fractional_processed is '00' → formatted_number is '0.00'.

so output is '($0.00)'.

Yes.

Sample input 4: '-12345678.9' → integer part is 12345678 → formatted as 12,345,678. fractional_part is '9' → processed as '90'. formatted_number is 12,345,678.90. So output is ($12,345,678.90).

Yes.

Sample input 2: '0.000' → sign is positive. formatted integer is '0', fractional_processed is '00' → output is $0.00.

So the code steps:

if sign is -1:

   result = '(${formatted_number})'

else:

   result = '${formatted_number}'

Putting it all together.

Now, code steps:

Read s = input().strip()

sign is -1 if starts with '-', else +1.

num_str = s[1:] if sign is -1 else s.

split into integer_part and fractional_part as before.

process fractional_part to two digits.

format integer_part with commas.

formatted_number = formatted_integer + '.' + fractional_processed.

then, apply the sign:

if sign is -1:

   output = '($' + formatted_number + ')'

else:

   output = '$' + formatted_number.

Now, some corner cases.

Test case where the input is '0' → output '$0.00'.

Test case where input is '-0.00' → output is '($0.00)'.

Another case: '1234.5678' → integer part 1234 → formatted as 1,234. fractional part '56' → output is $1,234.56.

Another case: '1234.5' → fractional_processed is '50' → $1,234.50.

Another case: '1234.5' → fractional part is '5' → processed as '50'.

Another case: '1234.567' → fractional part is '56'.

So the code should handle these.

Now, code in Python.

But let's code the integer formatting.

Implementing the function to format the integer part.

In code:

def format_integer(s):

    reversed_s = s[::-1]

    groups = []

    for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

        group = reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1]

        groups.append(group)

    groups = groups[::-1]

    return ','.join(groups)

But wait, how to handle the integer_part. Let's see: the integer_part is a string. For example, '0' → returns '0' as desired.

Another example: '12345678' → '12,345,678'.

Now, code steps.

Putting it all together:

s = input().strip()

sign = -1 if s.startswith('-') else 1

if sign == -1:

    num_str = s[1:]

else:

    num_str = s

if '.' in num_str:

    integer_part, fractional_part = num_str.split('.', 1)

else:

    integer_part = num_str

    fractional_part = ''

# process fractional_part

fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]

# process integer_part

reversed_s = integer_part[::-1]

groups = []

for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

    group = reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1]

    groups.append(group)

groups = groups[::-1]

formatted_integer = ','.join(groups)

formatted_number = f"{formatted_integer}.{fractional_processed}"

if sign == -1:

    print(f"(${formatted_number})")

else:

    print(f"${formatted_number}")

Wait, but what if the integer_part is empty? According to the problem constraints, the input cannot be like that. Because the input must have at least one decimal digit, and the '.' must have digits before and after. So integer_part will never be empty.

Testing sample input 3:

Input: -0.00987654321 → num_str is '0.00987654321' → split into integer_part '0', fractional_part '00987654321'.

fractional_processed = '00' + '00'? No. Wait, fractional_part is '00987654321' → ( '00987654321' + '00')[:2] → '00'.

formatted_integer is '0'.

formatted_number is '0.00'.

since sign is -1, output is '($0.00)'.

Which matches sample 3.

Sample input 4: '-12345678.9' → num_str is '12345678.9' → split into integer_part '12345678', fractional_part '9'.

fractional_processed → '9' + '00' → '900'[:2] → '90'.

formatted_integer is:

reversed_s is '87654321' → split into i=0 → 876 → reversed '678', i=3 → 543 → '345', i=6 → 21 → '12'.

groups after loop: ['678', '345', '12']. reversed → ['12', '345', '678'] → joined → '12,345,678'.

formatted_number → '12,345,678.90' → sign is -1 → output is ($12,345,678.90), which matches sample 4.

Sample input 2: input is '0.000' → num_str is '0.000' → split into integer_part '0', fractional_part '000' → fractional_processed is '00'.

formatted_integer is '0' → formatted_number is 0.00 → sign is positive → $0.00.

Sample input 1: 2012 → integer_part '2012', reversed_s '2102' → split into 210 and 2 → reversed groups '012' and '2' → groups after reversing: ['2', '012'] → joined as '2,012'. So formatted_integer is '2,012' → output is $2,012.00.

Wait, wait, let's test the code for integer_part '2012'.

reversed_s = '2012' → reversed is '2102'? Wait, no. Wait, integer_part is '2012' → reversed_s is '2102' → split into groups of three.

Wait, original '2012' → reversed is '2102'.

Loop steps:

i=0 → 0 to 3 → '210' → reversed to '012' → group becomes '012'.

i=3 → 3 to 4 (since len(reversed_s) is 4) → '2' → reversed to '2' → group '2'.

groups after loop: ['012', '2'].

Then reverse the groups list → ['2', '012'] → joined with commas → '2,012'.

Yes, which is correct.

So the code handles that.

Now, what about leading zeros in the integer part? The problem statement says that the input's integer part is either zero or has no leading zeros. So the code doesn't need to handle leading zeros except for the '0' case.

So, code is correct.

Now, code in Python.

But wait, in the code, when formatting the integer_part, if the integer_part is '0', the code will output '0', which is correct.

Now, code:

s = input().strip()

sign = -1 if s.startswith('-') else 1

if sign == -1:

    num_str = s[1:]

else:

    num_str = s

if '.' in num_str:

    integer_part, fractional_part = num_str.split('.', 1)

else:

    integer_part = num_str

    fractional_part = ''

# Process fractional part

fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]

# Process integer part

reversed_s = integer_part[::-1]

groups = []

for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

    group = reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1]

    groups.append(group)

groups = groups[::-1]

formatted_integer = ','.join(groups)

formatted_number = f"{formatted_integer}.{fractional_processed}"

if sign == -1:

    print(f"(${formatted_number})")

else:

    print(f"${formatted_number}")

Wait, but in Python, the code can be optimized.

But according to the constraints, the input is up to 100 characters, which is manageable. So this code should handle all cases.

Testing the code against the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

Input: 2012 → code processes num_str as '2012'.

Split into integer_part '2012', fractional_part ''.

fractional_processed is ('' + '00')[:2] → '00'.

Formatted integer:

reversed_s is '2102'.

Groups:

i=0 → 210 → reversed → '012' → group '012'.

i=3 → 2 → reversed → '2' → group '2'.

groups list after loop: ['012', '2'] → reversed → ['2', '012'] → joined as '2,012'.

formatted_number is '2,012.00' → sign is positive → output is '$2,012.00'.

Sample input 2:

Input: 0.000 → num_str is '0.000' → split into integer '0', fractional '000'.

fractional_processed is '000' + '00' → '00000' → first two chars '00'.

formatted integer is '0' → output is '$0.00'.

Sample input 3:

Input: -0.00987654321 → sign is -1. num_str is '0.00987654321'.

split into integer '0', fractional '00987654321'.

fractional_processed is ( '00987654321' + '00')[:2] → '00'.

formatted integer is '0' → formatted_number is '0.00'.

output is '($0.00)'.

Sample input4:

Input: -12345678.9 → sign is -1. num_str is '12345678.9' → split into integer '12345678', fractional_part '9'.

fractional_processed is '9' + '00' → '900' → first two '90'.

formatted integer part:

reversed_s is '87654321' → split into 876,543,21.

groups:

i=0 → 876 → reversed → '678' → group '678'.

i=3 → 543 → reversed → '345' → group '345'.

i=6 → 21 → reversed → '12' → group '12'.

groups list: ['678', '345', '12'] → reversed → ['12', '345', '678'] → joined as '12,345,678'.

formatted_number → '12,345,678.90'.

sign is -1 → output is '($12,345,678.90)'.

All samples pass.

Another test case: input '1234.5' → formatted as '1,234.50'.

Another test case: input '-0' → according to the problem constraints, the input can't be '-0' because the note says that if a number is identically zero, it doesn't have a minus sign. So the input will not have '-0' as per the problem's constraints.

So the code handles all valid inputs.

Thus, this code should be correct.
</think>

```python
s = input().strip()
sign = -1 if s.startswith('-') else 1
num_str = s[1:] if sign == -1 else s

if '.' in num_str:
    integer_part, fractional_part = num_str.split('.', 1)
else:
    integer_part, fractional_part = num_str, ''

fractional_processed = (fractional_part + '00')[:2]
reversed_s = integer_part[::-1]
groups = [reversed_s[i:i+3][::-1] for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3)]
formatted_integer = ','.join(reversed(groups))
formatted_number = f"{formatted_integer}.{fractional_processed}"

print(f"(${formatted_number})" if sign == -1 else f"${formatted_number}")
