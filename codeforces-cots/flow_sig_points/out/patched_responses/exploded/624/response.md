Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to compare two very large numbers given as strings. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says the numbers can have leading zeros, but when comparing them, those leading zeros don't matter. For example, 000123 is equal to 123. So the first step is to compare their lengths after stripping leading zeros. Wait, no—because maybe the numbers are all zeros. Like 0000 is equal to 0. So first, I need to process each number by removing leading zeros, but if all are zeros, leave a single zero.

So the plan is:

1. For each input string (a and b), process them by stripping leading zeros. If the result is empty, that means the original number was all zeros, so replace with "0".
2. Then compare the lengths of the processed strings. If one is longer than the other, then that number is larger.
3. If the lengths are equal, then compare the strings lexicographically. Since they are both numeric and leading zeros are stripped, the lex order should match the numeric order.

So steps in code:

- Read a and b as strings.
- Process each to remove leading zeros. For example, a_stripped = a.lstrip('0') or '0' if the result is empty.
- Compare the stripped versions.

Wait, but how to process the stripping correctly. Let's say the input is '0000', then stripping all zeros would give an empty string. So we need to check if the stripped string is empty, and if so, replace with '0'.

So for a, do:

a = a.lstrip('0') or '0'

Wait, in Python, the string method lstrip('0') removes leading zeros. So for example, '000123' becomes '123', '0' becomes '', so after or '0', it becomes '0'. That's correct.

So once both a and b are processed this way, then compare their lengths. If a's length is longer than b's, then a is bigger. Else if shorter, then smaller. If same length, compare character by character.

So code steps:

Read a and b.

Process a_stripped = a.lstrip('0') or '0'

Same for b_stripped.

Compare the lengths first. If a_len > b_len → a is larger. If a_len < b_len → a is smaller. Else, compare each character from left to right. The first position where they differ determines which is larger.

So in code:

a = input().strip()
b = input().strip()

a_stripped = a.lstrip('0') or '0'
b_stripped = b.lstrip('0') or '0'

len_a = len(a_stripped)
len_b = len(b_stripped)

if len_a > len_b:
    print('>')
elif len_a < len_b:
    print('<')
else:
    # same length, compare each digit
    if a_stripped > b_stripped:
        print('>')
    elif a_stripped < b_stripped:
        print('<')
    else:
        print('=')

Wait, but when comparing the stripped strings lexicographically, since they are numbers, this should work because all leading zeros are removed. For example, '123' vs '124' → '123' is lex smaller, so correct. '9' vs '10' → len is 1 vs 2, so no. But in the case where lengths are the same, then lex order is correct.

Yes, this approach should work.

Testing examples:

First example:

Input:

9

10

After stripping, a is '9', b is '10'. Lengths 1 vs 2 → a has shorter length. So output '<'. Correct.

Second example:

11 and 10 → stripped lengths 2 each. Compare '11' vs '10' → '11' is larger. So '>'.

Third example:

00012345 → stripped is 12345 (length 5), and 12345 (length 5). Equal, so '='.

Fourth example:

0123 → stripped is '123' (len 3), b is '9' (len 1). So 3>1 → output '>'.

Another example: 0123 (stripped len 3) vs 111 (stripped len 3). Compare '123' vs '111' → '123' is larger. So output '>'.

Wait wait, but 0123 is '123' which is 123, but 111 is 111. So 123 is larger. So code would output '>', which matches the example.

Yes.

So the code should handle all cases.

But in Python, how does the string comparison work? Let's see.

In Python, comparing '123' and '111' would check '1' vs '1' → same. Then '2' vs '1' → since '2' is greater, the entire string is considered greater. So yes, that works.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Now, considering the input size. The problem says each number can have up to 1e6 digits. So, when we read the input as a string, that's manageable. But when we process them, stripping leading zeros could take O(n) time, but since n is 1e6, that's acceptable in Python. Because lstrip is a built-in method optimized in C, it's fast enough.

So the code as written should work, even for large inputs.

Now, the code needs to read the input correctly. Also, note that the input lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces? The problem says that the input numbers may have leading zeros. So perhaps the input is read as a line, and we need to strip any leading/trailing whitespace.

For example, if the input for a is '  000123  ', then we need to process that as '000123' → stripping leading zeros gives '123'. So in code, the lines should be read as input().strip().

Yes, so a = input().strip(), same for b.

So the code is correct.

Now, in terms of speed, reading the input lines with input().strip() is efficient. Even for 1e6 characters, as the input function is optimized.

Thus, the code should pass all test cases within the time constraints.

So the code is as follows.

```python
a = input().strip()
b = input().strip()

# Process leading zeros
a_clean = a.lstrip('0') or '0'
b_clean = b.lstrip('0') or '0'

len_a = len(a_clean)
len_b = len(b_clean)

if len_a > len_b:
    print('>')
elif len_a < len_b:
    print('<')
else:
    if a_clean > b_clean:
        print('>')
    elif a_clean < b_clean:
        print('<')
    else:
        print('=')
```
