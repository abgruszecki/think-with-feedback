<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement says we need to count the number of valid ways to assign types to each vault in a tree structure such that certain conditions are met. Let's break down the conditions again.

First, the highest security vaults are of type k. All such vaults must be such that their adjacent vaults have a type less than k. Also, there can be at most x of these highest security vaults, and all of them must be type k. Oh right, and the rest can be any type except possibly k, but adjacent to a k cannot be k. Wait no: the condition is that if a vault is of type k, then all its adjacent vaults must have a type less than k, and those adjacent cannot be k. So, the non-k nodes can have any type except k, but if a node is adjacent to a k, its type must be less than k. But other nodes (not adjacent to any k) can be anything up to m, as long as they are not k. Wait, no: the problem says "vaults of type k have the highest security". So, any vault that's not type k can have a type between 1 and m, except that if it's adjacent to a type k, then its type must be less than k. Otherwise, if it's not adjacent to a type k, it can be anything from 1 to m (but not k?), wait no. Wait, the problem says:

The conditions are:
- All vaults of type k are considered highest security.
- If a vault is highest security (type k), then its adjacent vaults cannot be highest security (so they can't be type k) and their type must be less than k.
- The number of highest security vaults (type k) is at most x.

So, the nodes not of type k can be any type as long as:
- If they are adjacent to a type k node, their type must be <k.
- Otherwise, their type can be anything except k (since k is the highest), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says "all vaults of type k have the highest security". So any other vault can have type from 1 to m, but their type is not k. Wait, no: maybe there are other vaults with type higher than k? But no, because the problem states that "the highest security are type k". So all other vaults must have type <=k? Or no? Wait, the problem says "the vaults with the highest security are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security." So, type k is the highest. So any other type must be less than or equal to k? Or can they be higher than k? Wait, that's a possible ambiguity. Let's read the problem statement carefully again.

The problem statement says: "The vaults with the highest security are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security." So, any vault of type k is the highest security, and there are no other vaults of higher security. But the other vaults can be of any type less than or equal to k, but the problem adds another condition: the adjacent nodes to a k must be less than k. So, the other nodes (non-k) can be of any type except k. Wait, no. Let's think:

If a node is not of type k, then its type can be anything as long as:

- If it's adjacent to a k, then it's type must be less than k.

- Otherwise, it can be any type from 1 to m, but not k. Wait, no: the problem says that the highest security is k, but other types can be anything. Wait, the problem states that "all vaults of type k have the highest security". So other vaults can be of any type except k? Because the problem says that the highest security is k. So no other vault can be of type higher than k, because then they would have higher security. So, all non-k vaults must have types from 1 to k-1. Otherwise, if m allows types higher than k, then those types would be higher security than k, which contradicts the problem statement.

Ah, right! So if m >=k, then there are types higher than k, but the problem states that the highest security is k, so those types can't exist. Therefore, all non-k nodes must have types <=k. Wait, no, this seems conflicting. Let's re-read the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says that the vaults of type k are the ones with the highest security. All other vaults have security less than k. So, the types of other vaults must be in 1..k-1. Because if any other vault had a type higher than k, then that would contradict the fact that k is the highest security. So, regardless of m's value, the non-k nodes must have types in 1..k-1. Wait, but m can be larger than k. For example, in the first sample input, m is 2 and k is 1. Then, all non-k nodes must have type less than k (so 0?), but since types start at 1. So that's impossible, hence the sample output is 1 where all nodes are type 2. So, the reasoning is that when k is 1, any adjacent node to a type k (1) must be less than 1. But since the minimum type is 1, that's impossible. So the sample input 1 requires that there are zero type k nodes, and all nodes are of type 2.

So, the problem requires that:

- All type k nodes are the highest security.

- All other nodes (non-k) must have type <=k-1. Because if any non-k node has type >=k, that would imply a higher security than k, which is not allowed.

Wait, no. The problem says that all type k are highest, and that's it. So any other type can be anything else. But the problem adds that if a vault is of type k, then its adjacent must be less than k. So, other nodes not adjacent to a k can be any type except k. But if m is higher than k, then those nodes could have types between k+1 and m. But according to the problem statement, those types would have security higher than k, which is not possible. Therefore, the problem must imply that all non-k nodes have types <=k-1. Because otherwise, the existence of a type higher than k would contradict the problem's condition that type k is the highest security.

So, this is a critical point. Let's see:

The problem statement says:

"The vaults with the highest security are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security."

This means that type k is the maximum possible security level. So, no other type can be higher than k. Therefore, any non-k node must have a type less than or equal to k-1. But m can be larger than k. How is this possible?

Ah, the problem must be that m can be greater than k, but in such cases, the non-k nodes can't have types greater than k-1. Therefore, the possible types for non-k nodes are 1 to k-1, regardless of m. So, m's value doesn't affect the available options for non-k nodes. Wait, but in the first sample input, m is 2 and k is 1. So, the non-k nodes must have type less than 1, but the possible types are 1 and 2. But since m=2, how does that work? Wait, perhaps the problem statement's first paragraph says that types are between 1 and m. So, each vault's type is a number between 1 and m. So when k is 1, the adjacent nodes must have type <1, which is impossible. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the conditions is to have zero type 1 nodes, and all nodes must be of type 2 (since 2 is allowed as it's not k and m is 2). But in this case, the non-k nodes can have types up to m=2, but since k=1, they can be any type except 1. Because if there are no type k nodes, then the adjacent condition isn't triggered. So in that case, the non-k nodes can be any type except k. So, the problem allows for non-k nodes to have any type from 1 to m except k. But only those adjacent to k nodes must have types less than k.

Wait, but according to the problem's conditions, the security of type k is the highest. So if a non-k node has a type greater than k, then that would be a higher security than k, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-k nodes must have type <=k. But if the problem allows m to be higher than k, then this seems conflicting. So perhaps the problem's condition is that all non-k nodes can have any type except k, but their type must be less than k. Wait no, that's not possible. For example, in the second sample input where m=3, k=2. Then the non-k nodes can be 1 or 3. But 3 is higher than k=2, which would have higher security. But the problem says that the highest security is type k=2. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem's actual condition is that all non-k nodes must have types less than k. Because otherwise, types higher than k would exist and be higher security.

Ah, here's the confusion. The problem statement's first paragraph says that each vault's type is a number between 1 and m. But the security hierarchy is such that type k is the highest. So, any type higher than k would imply higher security than k, which is not allowed. Therefore, all non-k nodes must have types less than k. So regardless of m's value, the non-k nodes can only be of types 1 to k-1. But wait, what if m is less than k? For example, m=2 and k=3. Then k is higher than m, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem's input constraints must ensure that k is <= m. But looking at the input constraints, k can be up to m. So the problem says that 1 ≤k ≤m. So that's handled. Therefore, when m >=k, non-k nodes can be 1 to k-1. But when m <k, then k is not allowed. But according to the input constraints, k can be up to m, so when m <k, the input is invalid. Wait, no. The input constraints for k are 1 ≤k ≤m. Wait no: the problem says, "the last line of input contains two integers k and x (1 ≤k ≤m, 1 ≤x ≤10)". So yes, k is always ≤m. So, m >=k. So, for non-k nodes, their types can be 1 to k-1, because higher types (like k+1) don't exist as m is >=k, but k is the maximum. So, all non-k nodes must have types from 1 to k-1, unless they are not adjacent to any k node. Wait, no. Wait, the problem's condition is:

- For a node of type k, all adjacent nodes must have type less than k.

Other nodes (not adjacent to any k) can have any type except k. But since k is the maximum allowed type (as per the security hierarchy), their type must be less than k. So, regardless of adjacency, all non-k nodes must be of type less than k. Therefore, all non-k nodes must have types in 1..k-1.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the sample input 2. Let's check that.

Sample input 2:

3 3

Edges: 1-2, 1-3.

k=2, x=1.

Sample output is 13.

So, the possible scenarios are:

We can have 0, 1 type 2 nodes (since x=1). Let's compute each case.

Case 1: 0 type 2 nodes. Then all nodes are 1 or 3 (since k=2, non-k nodes can be any type except 2. Since m=3, they can be 1 or 3. But wait, no. Because according to the security condition, non-k nodes must be <k. k is 2, so non-k nodes must be 1. Because 3 is larger than k=2, which would have higher security than k. But the problem states that k is the highest. So this suggests that the non-k nodes can't be 3. But the sample input 2's output includes scenarios where non-k nodes are 3. Wait, this is a problem.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "the vaults with the highest security are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security."

So, any vault that's not of type k must have a security level lower than k. So their types must be less than k. So in sample input 2, k=2. So non-k nodes must have type less than 2 (i.e., 1). But m=3. So how does the sample input 2's output account for this?

Wait, this suggests that perhaps the problem's conditions are different. Let's read the problem statement again carefully.

The problem says that the highest security is type k, and all type k vaults are highest. The two conditions are:

1. If a vault is of type k, then all adjacent vaults are of type less than k.

2. All type k vaults are the maximum, so any other vault's type must be less than or equal to k? Or can they be higher than k?

No, the problem's first paragraph says that the highest security is type k, so other vaults can't be higher. Therefore, all non-k vaults must have types less than k.

So in sample input 2, k=2. So all non-k vaults must have type 1. But the sample input 2's output is 13. Let's see:

Wait, in the sample input 2, the output is 13. Let's think why.

If there are 0 type 2 nodes:

Each of the three nodes must be assigned a type other than 2. But according to the security condition, they must have types less than 2. So only type 1 is allowed. So all three nodes must be type 1. So that's 1 way.

If there is 1 type 2 node:

Suppose we select one node to be type 2. Then all its adjacent nodes must be type 1. The other nodes (not adjacent) can be any type except 2, but according to the security condition, since they are not adjacent to a type 2 node, but their types must be less than 2. So again, they must be type 1. Wait, this can't be. So in this case, the non-type 2 nodes (even those not adjacent) must be type 1. So selecting a node as type 2 would require that all adjacent are type 1, but other nodes not adjacent can be type 1. So for example, if node 1 is type 2, then nodes 2 and 3 (adjacent to 1) must be type 1. So there's 1 way for each node chosen as type 2.

But in the tree:

The tree is 1 connected to 2 and 3. So if node 1 is type 2, then nodes 2 and 3 must be type 1. That's one possibility. If node 2 is type 2, then node 1 must be type 1. Then node 3 is not adjacent to node 2, but it's adjacent to node 1 (type 1). So node 3 can be type 1. So in this scenario, node 2 is type 2, node 1 and 3 are type 1. Similarly for node 3 being type 2.

So that's three possibilities where exactly one node is type 2, and the rest are type 1. So each of these three cases contributes 1 way each. But then, in this case, the count would be 3.

But the sample output is 13. So there must be more possibilities. This suggests that perhaps my understanding of the problem is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the security condition. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Problem statement:

"Also, if a vault is of the highest security, its adjacent vaults are guaranteed to not be of the highest security and their type is guaranteed to be less than k."

So the only condition is that any adjacent vault to a type k must be less than k. But non-adjacent vaults can have any type (including >=k?), but since the security is highest at k, no other vault can have type >=k. So the only way this works is that all non-type k vaults must have type <k. Because if any vault has type >=k, then that's a higher security than type k, which is not allowed.

But according to sample input 2, when k=2 and m=3, the possible types for non-k vaults are 1 and 3. But 3 is higher than k=2. So this would be impossible, but the sample input 2's output is 13. Therefore, my previous reasoning must be wrong.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the problem's conditions are:

The vaults of type k are the highest, but other vaults can have any type from 1 to m, as long as they are not of type k. The only restriction is that adjacent to a type k must be less than k. So, if a vault is not adjacent to any type k, then it can be any type except k, even if it's higher than k. But this contradicts the problem statement's assertion that type k is the highest.

This is a crucial point. The problem statement is ambiguous here. Let's read the problem's conditions again.

The problem says:

"the vaults with the highest security are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security."

Which implies that type k is the highest. So, any other vault's type must have security less than k. Therefore, their types must be less than k. But how does that work when m is larger than k?

Ah, this is a contradiction. For example, in sample input 2, m is 3 and k is 2. Then, the non-k vaults can have types 1,3. But type 3 would be higher than k=2, which violates the problem's condition. So how is sample input 2's answer 13?

Looking at the sample input 2's explanation:

In test case 2:

k=2, x=1. So the maximum number of type 2 nodes is 1.

Possible cases:

Case 1: zero type 2 nodes. Then all nodes can be any type except 2. So possible types are 1 and 3. But since all nodes are not type 2, and not adjacent to any type 2, their types can be 1 or 3. But wait, according to the problem statement, since they are not type 2, their security is lower than type 2. But types 3 are higher than 2. So this is a problem.

But according to the sample input 2's output, this case is possible. Therefore, my previous understanding must be incorrect.

Ah, I think I see where I'm wrong. The problem says that type k is the highest security. But the actual type numbers can be higher than k. The problem's "highest security" is determined by being type k. So any vault of type k is highest, and other vaults can be any type except k. The security level is not determined by the numerical value of the type. For example, if m is 3 and k is 2, then the types allowed are 1, 3 (for non-k vaults). But type 3 is higher than k=2, but the problem says that security is determined by being type k, not by the type's numerical value. So, the security of a vault is determined solely by whether it is type k. All other types, regardless of their numerical value, have lower security than type k. So, even if a vault is type 3 when k is 2, that's allowed as long as it's not adjacent to a type 2 vault. Because the security of type 3 is considered lower than type 2. So the numerical value of the type doesn't determine the security level. Only the fact that a vault is of type k or not.

Oh! That's a key insight. So, the problem is not that the type k is the maximum numerical value. Instead, the problem defines that all vaults of type k are the highest security, regardless of other types. So, other vaults can have any type from 1 to m, except k, but if they are adjacent to a type k, their type must be less than k. So, the type's numerical value matters only in the adjacency condition. So, if a vault is not adjacent to a type k, it can have any type except k, even if it's numerically larger than k. But the security of those vaults is considered lower than type k.

So, in sample input 2, when there are zero type 2 nodes, each of the three nodes can be any type except 2. Since m=3, possible types are 1 or 3. So each node has 2 possibilities. So the total is 2^3=8.

If x=1, then the maximum allowed type 2 nodes is 1. So the cases are:

- 0 type 2 nodes: 2^3=8 ways.

- 1 type 2 node: Let's pick a node to be type 2. Then its adjacent nodes must be types <k=2. So their type must be 1. The remaining nodes (those not adjacent) can be any type except 2. For example, if node 1 is type 2, then nodes 2 and 3 (adjacent to node 1) must be type 1. So the counts for this case: 1 (type 2 node) * 1 (nodes 2's type) *1 (node 3's type) =1.

If node 2 is type 2, then its adjacent node is 1. So node 1 must be type 1. Node 3 is adjacent to node 1 (type 1), which is not a type 2, so node 3 can be type 1 or 3. Wait, no: the condition is that adjacent to a type k (2) must be <k. But node 3 is adjacent to node 1 (type 1), which is not a type k. So node 3's type can be anything except 2 and must be >=k? No, no. The condition for a non-type k node's adjacent nodes is only if they are adjacent to a type k node. So, the only constraints are:

- Type k nodes have their adjacent nodes' type <k.

- Other nodes (non-k) can be any type except k, but if they are adjacent to a type k node, their type must be <k.

So, in the case where node 2 is type 2:

- node 2's adjacent nodes (node 1) must be type <2. So type 1.

- node 3 is not adjacent to any type 2 node. So its type can be 1 or 3 (since m=3, k=2).

So for this case, node 3 has 2 possibilities.

So in this scenario, when node 2 is type 2, node 1 must be type 1, node 3 can be type 1 or 3. So 2 possibilities.

Similarly, if node 3 is type 2, node 1 must be type 1, and node 2 can be 1 or 3. So 2 possibilities.

So the total for 1 type 2 nodes is:

If node 1 is type 2: 1 (node 2) *1 (node3) =1.

If node 2 is type 2: 1 (node1) *2 (node3) =2.

If node3 is type 2: 1 (node1) *2 (node2) =2.

So total 1+2+2=5.

So 0 type 2 nodes: 8.

1 type 2 nodes: 5.

Total 8+5=13, which matches the sample output.

Ah, so now I understand. The key is that the type's numerical value doesn't determine security level except for type k. The security hierarchy is such that type k is the highest, and other types can be any number except k, but for nodes adjacent to k, their type must be <k. Otherwise, they can be any type except k, even if it's higher than k. Because the security is determined by being type k, not by the type's numerical value.

So, the problem's conditions are:

1. All type k nodes are highest security.

2. All adjacent nodes to a type k node must be of type <k.

3. The number of type k nodes is at most x.

Other nodes (not adjacent to any type k) can be any type except k (so from 1..m, excluding k), and their type can be greater than or less than k. But type k is the only one considered highest security.

Therefore, the steps to solve the problem are:

- For each possible number of type k nodes (from 0 to x), compute the number of valid colorings.

- Sum these possibilities.

But how to compute the valid colorings for a given number of type k nodes (s)?

Each coloring must select s nodes in the tree such that no two are adjacent (since if two are adjacent, then their adjacent nodes are type k, violating the condition that adjacent nodes to a type k must be <k). Also, for each selected node (type k), all their adjacent nodes must not be type k and their type must be <k.

Moreover, the nodes not selected (non-k) can be colored as follows:

- If adjacent to a type k node: must be colored with a type <k. So, there are (k-1) choices.

- If not adjacent to any type k node: can be colored with any type except k. So, (m-1) choices.

So the approach is:

For each possible s (number of type k nodes, from 0 to x), compute the number of valid ways to select s nodes such that no two are adjacent (independent set), and then multiply by the number of ways to color the remaining nodes.

So, the problem reduces to two parts:

1. For each s (0<=s<=x), compute the number of ways to choose s nodes that form an independent set (no two adjacent).

2. For each such selection, compute the number of valid colorings of the remaining nodes, which depends on the adjacency to the s nodes.

The total for each s is (number of ways to choose the s nodes) multiplied by (product of choices for each node's color based on adjacency).

Then, sum over s from 0 to x.

The challenge is to compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1e5) and x up to 10.

So, how to model this?

Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem on the tree.

For the first part (counting the number of independent sets of size s), we can use a DP approach where for each node, we track whether it is selected (type k) or not. Since the tree is a tree, we can use a tree DP approach.

But for each s up to x, which is up to 10, this may be feasible.

But for each node, the DP state needs to track the number of selected nodes (s) and whether the node is selected.

Additionally, for the color part, once the s nodes are selected, the color possibilities for the rest depend on whether they are adjacent to any selected node.

But how to model this in the DP.

Wait, perhaps the color possibilities can be precomputed once the selected nodes are known. For example, once we have a set of s nodes (independent set), the number of colorings is:

For each node in the tree:

- If it is in the selected set: 1 way (type k).

- Else, if it is adjacent to any selected node: (k-1) ways (since it must be <k).

- Else: (m-1) ways (since it can't be k, but can be any of the other m-1 types).

So the total for a particular selection of s nodes (independent set) is:

product over all nodes:

if node is selected: 1.

else if adjacent to any selected node: (k-1).

else: (m-1).

So, the problem is to compute, for each s, the sum over all possible independent sets of size s of the product of (k-1) for each adjacent node and (m-1) for the others not adjacent.

But this seems computationally expensive, as for each s, you'd have to consider all possible independent sets of size s and compute the product for each.

But with n up to 1e5 and x up to 10, this approach is not feasible unless we find a way to model this with DP that captures both the count of independent sets and the product of the color possibilities.

So, the DP needs to track for each node, the number of selected nodes in its subtree, and some parameters that capture the necessary information to compute the product.

Let's think recursively. For each node u, when processing its children, we can track two states:

- u is selected (must not have any children selected).

- u is not selected (children can be selected or not, but if any child is selected, u's parent's state may affect adjacent counts).

But this seems complex. Let's model the DP state as follows:

For each node u and for a current count s (from 0 to x), track two possibilities:

a) u is selected.

b) u is not selected.

For each of these possibilities, we also need to track the product of the color possibilities for the subtree rooted at u, considering whether u is selected or not, and whether it's adjacent to selected nodes.

But I'm not sure how to model this. Let's think differently.

Suppose we have an independent set S. The product for the coloring is:

prod = 1.

for each node not in S:

if adjacent to any node in S: (k-1) choices.

else: (m-1) choices.

But this can be rewritten as:

prod = (m-1)^(n - |S| - cnt_adj) * (k-1)^cnt_adj.

Where cnt_adj is the number of nodes not in S that are adjacent to at least one node in S.

Because:

Each node not in S contributes (m-1) if not adjacent to any S node, or (k-1) if adjacent.

But how to compute cnt_adj? It's the number of nodes in the tree not in S and adjacent to S.

But S is an independent set.

So for a given S, the cnt_adj is the number of nodes adjacent to any node in S.

So, for the product, it's (k-1) raised to the number of nodes adjacent to S and not in S, multiplied by (m-1) raised to the number of nodes not adjacent to S and not in S.

But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, note that the product can be expressed as:

prod = (m-1)^ (number of nodes not in S and not adjacent to S) ) * (k-1)^ (number of nodes not in S and adjacent to S).

But the problem is to compute this for all possible S of size s (0<=s<=x), and sum over all such S.

So, the total for each s is:

sum_{S is independent set of size s} ( (k-1)^{adj_S} * (m-1)^{non_adj_S} )

where adj_S is the number of nodes adjacent to S and not in S, and non_adj_S is the number of nodes not in S and not adjacent to S.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think about the variables. For a given node u:

If u is in S: then all its children cannot be in S. Also, u's parent cannot be in S.

Moreover, for each node in S, its adjacent nodes (children and parent) contribute to adj_S. But adj_S is the count of nodes adjacent to S but not in S.

So for a node u in S, all its adjacent nodes (children and parent) that are not in S are counted in adj_S.

So, for the independent set S, adj_S is the sum over all nodes in S of the number of adjacent nodes not in S.

Because S is an independent set, adjacent nodes between S members are not present. So, each node in S has its own adjacent nodes (not in S) contribute to adj_S.

But how to model this in the DP.

An alternative approach: The product can be rewritten as (m-1)^{total_non_S - adj_S} * (k-1)^{adj_S}, where total_non_S is the number of nodes not in S (n - s).

Because total_non_S = adj_S + non_adj_S.

But adj_S is the number of nodes not in S but adjacent to S.

Thus, (m-1)^(n - s - adj_S) * (k-1)^adj_S.

But this is equal to (m-1)^{n - s} * ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S }.

So the product can be written as (m-1)^{n-s} * ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S }.

So, sum over all S of size s:

prod_S = (m-1)^{n-s} * ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S }.

So, the total for size s is:

(m-1)^{n-s} * sum_{S} [ ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S} ].

So, the problem reduces to, for each s, compute the sum over all S (independent sets of size s) of ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S}.

Then multiply by (m-1)^(n-s).

But how to compute this sum.

Hmm. This seems challenging, but maybe we can model this with a DP that tracks for each node, the number of selected nodes, the adjacency contribution, and the product term.

But the exponent is tricky. However, since the term is multiplicative over adj_S, perhaps we can model the DP with a multiplicative factor.

Alternatively, think of the term ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S} as the product over all nodes in S of ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{degree(u)}, but subtract the contributions where adjacent nodes are also in S. But this may not be correct.

Alternatively, adj_S is the number of edges between S and non-S nodes. For each node in S, it contributes the number of its neighbors not in S. So adj_S is the sum over u in S of (number of neighbors of u not in S).

So, adj_S is equal to the sum over all edges (u, v) where u is in S and v is not in S.

So, for each such edge, we have a contribution of 1 to adj_S. So, adj_S is the number of edges between S and non-S.

So, the term (k-1/(m-1))^{adj_S} can be expressed as the product over all edges (u, v) where u is in S and v not in S of (k-1)/(m-1).

So, the sum over S of ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S} is equal to the sum over all S (independent sets of size s) of product over edges (u, v) where u is in S and v not in S of (k-1)/(m-1).

Hmm. This seems complicated, but maybe we can model this with a generating function approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP for each node u and track:

- whether u is selected or not.

- the number of selected nodes so far (up to x).

- the accumulated multiplicative factor from the edges.

But since x is up to 10, and the multiplicative factors can be combined, perhaps this is possible.

Let's formalize this. For each node u and state (s, a), where s is the number of selected nodes in the subtree rooted at u, and a is some accumulated factor (e.g., the product of (k-1)/(m-1) for edges in the subtree that contribute to adj_S), we can model transitions from children.

But even this seems challenging. Let's think in terms of the tree DP.

For each node u, we can model the DP as follows:

dp[u][s][0] = (ways when u is not selected, and have s selected nodes in the subtree)

dp[u][s][1] = (ways when u is selected, and have s selected nodes in the subtree)

But along with the count, we need to track the accumulated product term. But since the term is multiplicative, perhaps we can track the product as part of the DP's value.

So, for each node u, the DP state is a list of pairs (s, val), where s is the number of selected nodes in the subtree, and val is the accumulated product term.

This way, when merging the children's DP states, we can multiply the terms accordingly.

But even with x up to 10, for each node, this could be manageable.

So, the approach would be:

Initialize the DP for a leaf node.

When processing a node u, for each possible state (selected or not, and s selected nodes), combine with the states of the children.

Let's think for a node u. If u is selected:

- None of its children can be selected.

- For each child v of u, since u is selected, any child v cannot be selected. So, for each child v, we can only take the DP states where v is not selected.

- Additionally, each edge (u, v) where u is selected and v is not contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1) for each such edge.

So, when u is selected, the accumulated factor for each child v is multiplied by (k-1)/(m-1) for the edge u-v.

If u is not selected:

- Its children can be selected or not, but with the constraint that no two are selected and adjacent.

- For each child v, we can select it or not.

- For the edges where a child is selected, the factor (k-1)/(m-1) is applied to the edge (v, u) if u is not selected but v is selected.

Wait, because if u is not selected and v is selected, then the edge (u, v) is part of adj_S because v is in S and u is not. So, this contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1).

So, for the node u not selected:

For each child v, if v is selected, then the edge u-v contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1) (since v is in S, u is not). So, for each such child, when we select v, we multiply by that factor.

If v is not selected, then no contribution from this edge (unless v's children are selected, which is handled in their DP).

So, the DP transitions can be structured as follows:

For a node u:

Case 1: u is selected.

Then, for all children v, v must not be selected.

The accumulated factor for each child v is multiplied by the factor for the edge u-v (since u is in S and v is not).

So, the total factor for this case is:

product over all children v of (sum over their not selected states) multiplied by the edge factors.

Case 2: u is not selected.

Then, for each child v, we can select or not select them, but ensuring that no two are selected (since they are siblings and adjacent to u, which is not selected).

But since the tree is processed in a parent-child manner, the siblings are in different subtrees. So, if u is not selected, its children can be selected or not, but selected children can't have their own children selected.

Wait, no. For example, if u is not selected, a child v can be selected (if it doesn't have any children selected), and another child w can also be selected (since they are siblings and their parent is not selected). But since the tree is a tree, children are not connected except through their parent. So, if u is not selected, its children can be selected or not, but no two children can be selected if they are adjacent. But since the tree is a tree, children of u are not connected to each other, so they can be selected independently. So, if u is not selected, then any subset of children can be selected as long as no child is selected and has a selected parent (but the parent is u, which is not selected). So, each child can be selected or not, but in their own subtrees.

So, for case 2, the total ways is the product over children of (sum of selected and not selected states for each child).

But when a child is selected, it contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1) for the edge u-v (since v is selected and u is not).

So, for each child v in case 2 (u not selected):

If we select v: multiply by (k-1)/(m-1) and add 1 to the count s.

But since this is part of the DP, the transitions would need to track these factors.

This seems complex, but manageable.

Let's formalize the DP transitions.

For each node u:

We have two states: selected (1) or not selected (0).

For each state, we track for each possible s (number of selected nodes in the subtree rooted at u) the accumulated product term.

The transitions are:

If u is selected (state 1):

- Then, none of its children can be selected.

- So, for each child v, we take the sum of their state 0 (not selected) and multiply the terms.

- The accumulated product for this case is: the product of the child's state 0 terms, multiplied by the factor (k-1)/(m-1) for each child (since u is selected, and the child is not, so each edge contributes this factor).

So, for each child v:

term_v = sum_{s_v} dp[v][s_v][0] * (k-1/m-1)^{number of edges between u and v}

But since u is selected and v is not, each edge between u and v contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1). So, for each child v, if there is an edge between u and v (which there is, since it's a tree), we multiply by (k-1)/(m-1) once.

Wait, each edge between u and v is considered once. Since it's a tree, there is exactly one edge between u and each child v.

So, for each child v, when u is selected and v is not, the edge contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1).

So, the accumulated product for u being selected is:

prod = (k-1/m-1)^{c} * product over children v of dp[v][s_v][0], where c is the number of children of u.

Wait, no: each child v contributes one edge (u, v), so each edge contributes a factor of (k-1)/(m-1). So, if u has d children, then the factor is ((k-1)/(m-1))^d multiplied by the product of the children's state 0 terms.

Additionally, selecting u adds 1 to the count s.

So, the DP transition for state 1 is:

dp[u][s][1] = sum_{sum s_v = s-1} ( product_{v} ( (k-1/(m-1)) * dp[v][s_v][0] ) )

But since each child contributes a term (k-1/(m-1)) multiplied by their state 0 terms, the product over all children is (k-1/(m-1))^d * product_{v} dp[v][s_v][0], where d is the number of children.

The sum is over all combinations of s_v for each child such that their sum plus 1 (for u) equals s.

This is manageable, but since x is up to 10, and the tree has up to 1e5 nodes, we need an efficient way to compute this.

For the state 0 (u not selected):

The children can be in either state 0 or 1, but with the constraint that no two children are selected (since they are siblings and their parent is not selected). Wait, no: siblings are not connected by edges (since it's a tree), so their selection is allowed. For example, if u has two children v and w, and u is not selected, then v and w can both be selected. They are not adjacent, so there's no conflict.

So, for state 0:

Each child can be either selected (state 1) or not (state 0).

But when a child is selected, the edge between u and v contributes a factor of (k-1/(m-1)), since v is in S and u is not.

So, for each child v:

if v is selected (state 1), then the contribution is dp[v][s_v][1] * (k-1/(m-1)) 

if v is not selected (state 0), then the contribution is dp[v][s_v][0] 

So, for each child v, the total for state 0 is (dp[v][s_v][1] * (k-1/(m-1)) ) + dp[v][s_v][0} 

The total for state 0 of u is the product of these terms for all children, summed over all possible s_v such that the sum of s_v equals s.

But this is again a DP that combines the children's possibilities.

So, putting it all together, for each node u and state (selected or not), the DP tracks for each possible s (up to x) the accumulated product term.

This approach is feasible if x is small (up to 10).

Now, the challenge is to implement this DP efficiently.

The steps are:

1. Precompute the tree as an adjacency list.

2. Process the tree in post-order traversal (children processed before parents).

3. For each node, compute the DP tables for state 0 and 1, for s up to x.

4. After processing the entire tree, the root's DP will have the sum of all possible S (independent sets of size s), multiplied by their respective product terms.

5. For each s from 0 to x, compute the sum from the root's DP and multiply by (m-1)^(n-s), then sum all these terms.

Finally, return the sum modulo 1e9+7.

But there are some details to consider:

- The tree is undirected, so when building the adjacency list, we need to avoid revisiting the parent node. So, during the traversal, we need to track the parent to prevent cycles.

- The root can be chosen arbitrarily (e.g., node 1).

- Modular arithmetic: all operations must be performed modulo 1e9+7.

- Handling exponents: since (m-1) can be large (up to 1e9), we need to precompute (m-1)^(n-s) modulo MOD. But n can be up to 1e5, so precomputing exponents up to 1e5 is feasible.

But also, when m is 1, then (m-1) is 0. So, in cases where m=1 and there are non-zero terms, we need to handle this. For example, in sample input 3, m=1 and k=1. Since m=1, the only possible type is 1. But x=1, so the maximum allowed type k nodes is 1. But all nodes must be type 1, which is type k. But according to the problem's conditions, if a node is type k, its adjacent nodes cannot be type k. So, if there is at least one node, then the answer is 0, as in sample input 3.

So, handling m=1 is a special case.

But in the code, we need to handle when m=1, but k=1. Then, the number of possible ways is 0 unless x >=n and the tree is a collection of isolated nodes (which is impossible as it's a tree), but since it's a tree with n>=1, it's impossible to have all nodes selected (since adjacent nodes can't be selected), so the answer is 0.

But let's proceed with the general approach.

Now, let's outline the code steps.

First, read the input:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

edges = read n-1 edges.

k, x = map(int, input().split())

Then, build the adjacency list.

We need to process the tree, so we can build a parent-children structure. Let's choose node 1 as the root.

Then, for each node, we need to compute the DP tables.

The DP tables can be represented as a list of dictionaries or 2D arrays. But since x is up to 10, it's feasible to use a 2D array for each node.

For each node u, dp0 and dp1 are arrays of size x+1, where dp0[s] is the accumulated product for state 0 (not selected) with s selected nodes in the subtree, and similarly for dp1.

The initial state for leaves (assuming they are leaves in the tree structure):

For a leaf node u (except the root if it's a leaf), the DP can be initialized as:

If u is selected (state 1):

- s=1.

- The product term is 1 (for being selected) multiplied by the factor (k-1/(m-1))^d, where d is the number of children. But for a leaf (except the root), the number of children is zero (assuming the parent is the only neighbor). So, when u is selected, the product term is 1.

- Also, since u's parent cannot be selected (but the parent is processed later), this is handled during the traversal.

But to avoid confusion, let's proceed with code.

The code will:

- Process the tree in a post-order manner.

For each node u:

- Initialize dp0 and dp1 as arrays of size x+1, initialized to 0.

- For state 0 (not selected):

   For each child v, we can select any combination of their states (0 or 1), but with the constraint that the sum of selected nodes in the children's subtrees plus the current sum does not exceed x.

   For each child v, the contribution is:

   For state 0 of v: dp_v_0[s_v]

   For state 1 of v: dp_v_1[s_v] * (k-1)/(m-1)

   The sum of these for each child is the possible ways for the child.

   So, for state 0 of u, the accumulated product is the product of the sum over child v's possible contributions (state 0 and state 1).

   This is similar to a knapsack problem, where for each child, we combine the current ways with the child's possibilities.

- For state 1 (selected):

   All children must be in state 0.

   The accumulated product is the product of each child's state 0 contribution multiplied by (k-1/(m-1)) per child.

   So, for state 1 of u, the sum is the product of (dp_v_0[s_v] * (k-1/(m-1))) for each child, summed over s_v such that the total s = sum s_v +1.

This requires combining the children's contributions using knapsack-like merging.

But merging the children's DP tables can be computationally expensive if done naively. However, since x is small (up to 10), it's manageable.

So, for each node u:

- Initialize dp0 and dp1.

- For state 0:

   dp0 starts with 1 way for s=0.

   Then, for each child v:

      For each possible current sum s in 0..x:

          temp_dp0 = new array of zeros.

          For s_current in 0..x:

              For s_v in 0..x - s_current:

                  ways = dp0[s_current] * ( (child_v_0[s_v] + child_v_1[s_v] * (k-1) / (m-1) ) )

                  temp_dp0[s_current + s_v] += ways.

          dp0 = temp_dp0.

   Wait, no. For state 0, the current node's s is the sum of the children's s plus any selected in the current node (which is zero).

   So, for each child, we need to compute the combination of their state 0 and 1, multiply by the corresponding factors, and accumulate the sum.

   So, the merging is done as a convolution-like process, where for each child, we combine the existing ways with the child's possible ways.

   For example, initially, the dp0 for u is [1, 0, 0, ...] (0 selected nodes).

   For each child v:

      For each possible s_prev in 0..x:

          for each possible s_child in 0..x - s_prev:

              if s_prev + s_child <= x:

                  dp0_new[s_prev + s_child] += dp0_prev[s_prev] * (child_v0[s_child] + child_v1[s_child] * (k-1) / (m-1) )

   This is a standard knapsack merging step.

   However, since we're dealing with multiplicative terms (product of factors), the DP needs to track the accumulated product for each possible s.

   So, the merging step must account for the multiplicative factors from each child.

But since the DP for state 0 is the product of (child_v0 + child_v1 * (k-1)/(m-1)) for all children, the merging can be done by convoluting the possible s values and multiplying the factors.

But handling this with modular arithmetic and integer divisions (since (k-1)/(m-1) could be a fraction) is not feasible. So, this suggests that we need to precompute the multiplicative factors as fractions modulo MOD, using modular inverses.

But (k-1) and (m-1) can be zero. For example, if m=1, then m-1=0, but in that case, k must be 1 (since k <=m). So, (k-1) would be 0, and (k-1)/(m-1) is 0/0, which is undefined. But in that case, m=1 and k=1, which is allowed. But when m=1, the only possible type is 1. So, the problem's conditions require that all nodes are type 1, but their adjacent nodes must be <1. Which is impossible, so the answer is zero. So, the code can handle this case separately.

But assuming m !=1 or k !=1 when m=1.

But let's proceed. We need to compute the term (k-1)/(m-1) modulo MOD. But when m=1, this is only possible if k=1 (since k <=m), but m-1=0, so division is not possible. But in that case, if m=1 and k=1, the problem's conditions are that all nodes are type 1, but adjacent nodes must be <1, which is impossible. So, the answer is zero. So, in code, we can handle m=1 and k=1 as a special case.

Otherwise, when m !=1, the division (k-1) / (m-1) can be rewritten as (k-1) * inv(m-1) modulo MOD, where inv is the modular inverse.

So, the code will need to compute the factor (k-1) * inv(m-1) mod MOD, which we can precompute.

But first, handle the case when m=1:

if m ==1:

   if k ==1:

       # all nodes must be type 1. But then their adjacent nodes must be <1, which is impossible.

       # so if the tree has at least one edge, the answer is zero.

       # else, if n=1, then x >=1: answer 1.

       if n ==1 and x >=1:

           print(1)

       else:

           print(0)

   else:

       # k <=m=1 implies k=1, which is already handled.

So, in code, handle this case first.

Else:

   Compute the factor = (k-1) * inverse(m-1) mod MOD.

   inverse(m-1) is computed using pow(m-1, MOD-2, MOD).

But what if m-1 is 0 modulo MOD? Since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, but m can be up to 1e9. So, m-1 can be 0 modulo MOD only if m-1 is divisible by MOD. But since m can be up to 1e9, m=1e9+1+1 would have m-1=1e9+1, which is not 0 modulo MOD.

But MOD is 1e9+7, which is larger than m's maximum (1e9), so m-1 can't be 0 modulo MOD. So, the inverse exists.

So, the code can proceed.

Now, the DP transitions for each node u:

For state 0 (not selected):

The accumulated product is the product over children v of (dp0_v[s_v] + dp1_v[s_v] * factor).

This is handled as a knapsack problem where for each child, we merge their possibilities into the current dp0.

For state 1 (selected):

The accumulated product is the product over children v of (dp0_v[s_v] * factor).

So, each child contributes dp0_v[s_v] * factor, and the sum is for s = sum s_v +1.

But since the current node is selected, we add 1 to the sum.

So, the code for each node u's DP is:

Initialize dp0 and dp1 as arrays of size x+1, all zero.

For state 0:

Start with dp0_prev = [1] (ways for s=0).

Then, for each child v:

   new_dp0 = [0]*(x+1)

   for s_prev in 0..x:

       if dp0_prev[s_prev] ==0:

           continue

       for s_child in 0..x:

           if s_prev + s_child >x:

               continue

           ways_child = ( dp0_v[s_child] + dp1_v[s_child] * factor ) % MOD

           new_dp0[s_prev + s_child] = (new_dp0[s_prev + s_child] + dp0_prev[s_prev] * ways_child ) % MOD

   dp0_prev = new_dp0

After processing all children, dp0 = dp0_prev.

For state 1:

Start with dp1_prev = [1] for s=0 (no children selected, and multiply by factors for each child).

Then, for each child v:

   new_dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

   for s_prev in 0..x:

       if dp1_prev[s_prev] ==0:

           continue

       for s_child in 0..x:

           if s_prev + s_child +1 >x:

               continue

           ways_child = ( dp0_v[s_child] * factor ) % MOD

           new_dp1[s_prev + s_child +1] = (new_dp1[s_prev + s_child +1] + dp1_prev[s_prev] * ways_child ) % MOD

   dp1_prev = new_dp1

But wait, state 1 can only be possible if the sum of the children's selected nodes plus 1 (the current node) is <=x.

So, for state 1:

For each child v, the contribution is dp0_v[s_v] * factor (since child must be in state 0).

The sum of s_v for all children plus 1 (current node) must be <=x.

So, the code for state 1:

Initialize dp1_prev as [0]*(x+1).

dp1_prev[0] = 1 (before considering any children, but since the current node is selected, which contributes 1 to s).

Wait, no. The initial value for state 1 is 1 way for s=1 (the current node is selected, and no children). But when processing children, each child contributes 0 selected nodes (since they must be in state 0) and a factor of (k-1/(m-1)) per child.

Wait, the state 1 represents the current node being selected, which contributes 1 to the sum s. Then, each child must be in state 0, which contributes s_child to the sum. So the total s is 1 + sum s_child.

But for the merging:

Initially, before adding any children, the current node is selected (s=1), and no children contribute.

As each child is processed, the s is increased by the sum of s_child from the children's state 0.

So, for state 1:

The initial state is s=1, ways=1 (current node selected, no children).

Then, for each child v:

   For each possible s_current in 1..x:

       For each s_child in 0..x - s_current:

           new_s = s_current + s_child

           if new_s >x: continue

           new_dp1[new_s] += dp1_prev[s_current -1] * dp0_v[s_child] * factor

Because:

current s_current is 1 + sum of s_child_prev (before adding this child).

When adding this child's s_child (from state 0), the new s is s_current (current node's 1 + sum of previous s_child_prev) + s_child (from current child's state 0).

So, the code for state 1:

After initializing dp1_prev as [0]*(x+1), and dp1_prev[1] = 1? No, perhaps not.

Wait, initially, for the current node selected and no children, the sum s is 1.

For the first child:

For the child v, the contribution is s_child from v's state 0, multiplied by factor.

So, the new sum is 1 + s_child.

Thus, the merging for state 1 is a bit more involved.

Alternatively, the code for state 1 can be:

dp1_prev starts as [0]*(x+1).

dp1_prev[1] = 1 (current node is selected, no children).

Then, for each child v:

   new_dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

   for s_current in 0..x:

       if dp1_prev[s_current] ==0:

           continue

       for s_child in 0..x:

           new_s = s_current + s_child

           if new_s >x:

               continue

           contribution = dp1_prev[s_current] * (dp0_v[s_child] * factor % MOD) % MOD

           new_dp1[new_s] = (new_dp1[new_s] + contribution) % MOD

   dp1_prev = new_dp1

But s_current starts at 1 (since the current node is selected). Wait, no. For the first child, the s_current is 1 (current node's contribution) plus the s_child from the child's state 0.

So, the initial state is s_current=1, contribution=1.

Then, for each child, the code loops through s_current and s_child to update new_s.

But this seems correct.

So, in code:

For state 1:

dp1_prev starts as a list of zeros, with dp1_prev[1] = 1 * product of factors for the children processed so far.

Wait, no. For the current node, the initial state (no children) is s=1, and the product is 1 (since no children, so no factors).

Then, for each child, we multiply by factor (k-1/m-1) per child.

Wait, each child contributes a factor of (k-1/m-1) when the current node is selected.

So, for each child v, when the current node is selected and v is not, the edge (u, v) contributes a factor of (k-1/m-1).

So, for each child v, the contribution to the product is factor (which is (k-1)*inv(m-1)).

So, for state 1, the product for the current node is (factor)^d, where d is the number of children.

But this is handled during the processing of each child.

So, for each child v, when merging, the code multiplies the current ways by factor and by the child's state 0 ways.

Thus, the code for state 1 is:

Initially, dp1_prev is [0]*(x+1).

dp1_prev[1] = 1 (current node is selected, no children, product is 1).

For each child v:

   new_dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

   for s_current in 0..x:

       if dp1_prev[s_current] ==0:

           continue

       for s_child in 0..x:

           if s_current + s_child >x:

               continue

           contribution = dp1_prev[s_current] * dp0_v[s_child] % MOD

           contribution = contribution * factor % MOD

           new_dp1[s_current + s_child] = (new_dp1[s_current + s_child] + contribution) % MOD

   dp1_prev = new_dp1

This way, each child adds s_child (from state 0) to the current sum s_current (which starts at 1) and multiplies by factor.

Yes, this seems correct.

Now, the code can proceed to process each node in post-order, merging the children's DP tables into the current node's DP.

Once the root's DP is computed, for each s in 0..x, the sum of the root's state 0 and state 1 for s gives the total ways for s selected nodes.

But wait, the root can be in state 0 or 1. So, the total for s selected nodes is root's state0[s] + state1[s].

But no: the root's state0 and state1 are separate. For example, the root can be not selected (state0) with s nodes selected in its subtree, or selected (state1) with s nodes selected (including itself).

So, for each s, the total ways from the root's DP is dp0[s] + dp1[s].

Then, for each s, the number of colorings is (m-1)^(n-s) multiplied by (sum of the terms from the root's DP for s).

But how?

As derived earlier, the sum over S of (k-1/m-1)^{adj_S} is computed by the DP.

Then, the total for s selected nodes is:

total_s = (m-1)^(n-s) * (sum_{S of size s} ( (k-1/m-1)^{adj_S} )) 

Which is equal to (m-1)^(n-s) * (root_dp0[s] + root_dp1[s]).

So, the code must compute for each s in 0..x:

term = (pow(m-1, n-s, MOD) * ( (dp0[s] + dp1[s]) % MOD )) % MOD

sum all such terms for s from 0 to x.

So, the code steps are:

1. Handle the m=1 case.

2. Compute the factor = (k-1) * inv(m-1) mod MOD.

3. Build the tree as adjacency list and process in post-order.

4. For each node, compute dp0 and dp1 arrays.

5. After processing the root, sum dp0[s] + dp1[s] for s in 0..x.

6. For each s, multiply by (m-1)^(n-s), sum all terms.

7. Output the sum mod MOD.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But with n up to 1e5 and x up to 10, the code must be efficient.

Implementing the DP:

For each node, the DP for state 0 and state 1 are arrays of size x+1.

For each child, merging the state 0 and state 1 into the current node's state 0 and state 1.

This is O(x^2) per child per node, which for x=10 and n=1e5 is manageable (1e5 * 10^2 = 1e7 operations).

But the code must be written carefully to avoid timeouts.

Implementing the tree processing:

We can process the tree using a post-order traversal.

But for large trees, recursion may stack overflow, so an iterative approach is better.

But in Python, recursion depth is limited to around 1e4. So for n=1e5, recursion is not feasible. Hence, we need to use an iterative post-order traversal.

So, the code will:

- Build the tree as adjacency list.

- Choose a root (e.g., node 1).

- Build a parent-children structure, using a iterative approach (like BFS or DFS).

- Process the nodes in post-order.

Now, code implementation steps:

Read n and m.

Read edges and build adjacency list.

Read k and x.

Handle m=1 case:

if m ==1:

   if k !=1:

       print(0)

   else:

       # All nodes must be type 1.

       # Check if any edges exist. If yes, answer is 0.

       if n ==1 and x >=1:

           print(1)

       else:

           print(0)

   exit()

Compute factor = (k-1) * pow(m-1, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD.

Build the tree structure:

We can build the tree as a parent-children structure.

For example, using a BFS approach:

root = 0 (assuming nodes are 0-based or 1-based, depending on input).

But in Python, nodes are 1-based (according to input).

So:

from collections import deque

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for _ in range(n-1):

   u, v = map(int, input().split())

   adj[u].append(v)

   adj[v].append(u)

# Build parent-children structure.

parent = [0]*(n+1)

children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

visited = [False]*(n+1)

q = deque([1])

visited[1] = True

while q:

   u = q.popleft()

   for v in adj[u]:

       if not visited[v]:

           visited[v] = True

           parent[v] = u

           children[u].append(v)

           q.append(v)

# Now, children[u] contains all the children of u in the tree.

Now, process the nodes in post-order.

We can collect the nodes in post-order using a stack.

stack = [(1, False)]

post_order = []

while stack:

   u, processed = stack.pop()

   if processed:

       post_order.append(u)

       continue

   stack.append( (u, True) )

   for v in reversed(children[u]):

       stack.append( (v, False) )

Now, post_order contains the nodes in post-order.

For each node u in post_order:

   compute dp0 and dp1.

But for each node, we need to merge the children's DP tables.

So, for each node u:

   Initialize dp0 as [0]*(x+1).

   dp0[0] = 1.

   for each child v in children[u]:

       # merge dp0 with child v's state 0 and state 1.

       new_dp0 = [0]*(x+1)

       for s_prev in range(x+1):

           if dp0[s_prev] ==0:

               continue

           for s_v in range(x+1 - s_prev):

               combined_s = s_prev + s_v

               if combined_s >x:

                   continue

               # contribution from child v's state 0 and 1.

               ways_v = (v_dp0[s_v] + v_dp1[s_v] * factor) % MOD

               new_dp0[combined_s] = (new_dp0[combined_s] + dp0[s_prev] * ways_v) % MOD

       dp0 = new_dp0

   # compute dp1.

   dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

   dp1[1] = 1  # initial: current node is selected, no children.

   for child v in children[u]:

       new_dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

       for s_prev in range(x+1):

           if dp1[s_prev] ==0:

               continue

           for s_v in range(x+1 - s_prev + 1):

               if s_prev + s_v >x:

                   continue

               # contribution from child v's state 0.

               ways_v = v_dp0[s_v] * factor % MOD

               new_s = s_prev + s_v

               new_dp1[new_s] = (new_dp1[new_s] + dp1[s_prev] * ways_v) % MOD

       dp1 = new_dp1

   # store dp0 and dp1 for node u.

But wait, the code for dp1 merging is incorrect.

Let's think again. For each child v, when merging into dp1, the current node is selected (s_prev includes the 1 from the node itself plus any children processed so far).

But for each child v, the current s_prev represents 1 + sum of s_v from previously processed children.

Wait, no. For dp1, the initial state is s=1 (current node selected), and no children. Then, for each child v, when merging, the current s_prev is the sum of 1 + s_v from previous children, and for the current child v, the s_v is added to s_prev (which includes 1).

Wait, no. For dp1, the initial state after processing zero children is s=1 (current node selected). Then, for each child v, the merging adds s_v (from v's state 0) to the current s_prev.

So, for example:

Initial state after processing zero children: s_prev=1.

Processing child v:

s_prev ranges from 0 to x, but initially, s_prev=1.

For each possible s_v (from 0 to x), new_s is s_prev + s_v.

So, for each child v, the code must merge the current s_prev with s_v from v's state 0, multiply by factor.

Thus, the correct code for state 1 is:

Initialize dp1 as [0]*(x+1).

dp1[1] = 1 (current node selected, no children).

Then, for each child v:

   new_dp1 = [0]*(x+1)

   for s_prev in range(x+1):

       if dp1[s_prev] ==0:

           continue

       for s_v in range(x+1):

           new_s = s_prev + s_v

           if new_s >x:

               continue

           contribution = dp1[s_prev] * v_dp0[s_v] % MOD

           contribution = contribution * factor % MOD

           new_dp1[new_s] = (new_dp1[new_s] + contribution) % MOD

   dp1 = new_dp1

But wait, s_prev already includes the current node's 1, so when merging with the child's s_v (which is the number of selected nodes in the child's subtree), the total s is 1 (current node) + sum of s_v for all children.

Yes.

So, the code for state 1 is:

dp1 starts with [0, 1, 0, ..., 0].

For each child v:

   new_dp1 is initialized to zero.

   For each possible s_prev in the current dp1:

       For each s_v in the child's state0:

           new_s = s_prev + s_v.

           if new_s exceeds x: skip.

           contribution = dp1[s_prev] * (v_dp0[s_v] * factor) mod MOD.

           add to new_dp1[new_s].

   dp1 is updated to new_dp1.

But this is computationally expensive. For each child, it's O(x^2) operations.

But with x=10, this is manageable.

Now, putting it all together.

But in Python, for each node, we need to store its dp0 and dp1 arrays.

So, the code can have a list of dp0 and dp1 for each node.

But since we process the nodes in post-order, we can compute the dp0 and dp1 for each node and discard the children's data.

Thus, for each node in post_order:

   compute dp0 and dp1.

   store them in a dictionary or list.

But since the children have already been processed, their dp0 and dp1 can be accessed.

So, the code can be:

Testing against sample input 2.

Sample input 2:

3 3

1 2

1 3

2 1

The code's steps:

m=3, k=2, x=1.

factor = (2-1) * inv(3-1) mod MOD = 1 * 500000004 (since 2^{-1} mod MOD is 500000004) = 500000004.

Processing the tree:

nodes 2 and 3 are leaves, children of 1.

Processing node 2:

children empty.

dp0 for node 2:

[1, 0, ...]

dp1 for node 2:

[0, 1, 0, ...]

Processing node 3:

same as node 2.

Processing node 1:

children are 2 and 3.

For dp0:

Initially, dp0 for node 1 starts with [1, 0, ...].

Processing child 2:

v_dp0 = [1,0, ...], v_dp1 = [0,1, ...].

For s_prev in 0..1:

when s_prev=0:

   for s_v in 0..1:

       combined_s =0+0=0: ways_v = 1 + (0 * factor) =1. new_dp0[0] += 1*1=1.

       s_v=0: combined_s=0 → add 1*1=1.

       s_v=1: combined_s=1 → ways_v = 0 +1 * factor=500000004. new_dp0[1] += 1 * 500000004.

   So after child 2, new_dp0 is [1, 500000004, 0, ...].

Then processing child 3.

For each s_prev in 0..1:

s_prev=0:

   for s_v in 0..1:

       ways_v = 1 + 500000004 * 500000004 (no, wait, for child 3, v_dp0[s_v] is [1,0], v_dp1[s_v] is [0,1].

So, for s_v=0: ways_v =1 + 0 * factor =1.

s_v=0:

combined_s =0+0=0. contribution is 1*1=1. new_dp0[0] +=1.

s_v=1: combined_s=0+1=1. ways_v =0 +1*factor=500000004. new_dp0[1] += 1 * 500000004.

s_prev=1:

   s_prev=1, but after child 2, the new_dp0 is [1, 500000004, ...].

Wait, the code for node 1's dp0 after processing child 2:

dp0 is [1, 500000004, 0, 0, ...].

Processing child 3:

for s_prev in 0..x:

   s_prev=0: dp0[s_prev] =1.

       for s_v in 0..x:

           s_v can be 0 or 1.

           ways_v = v_dp0[s_v] + v_dp1[s_v] * factor.

           v_dp0[0] =1, v_dp1[0] =0 → ways_v =1.

           s_v=0: combined_s=0+0=0. contribution 1*1=1.

           s_v=1: ways_v =0 +1*500000004 →500000004. combined_s=0+1=1. contribution 1*500000004 =500000004.

   So for s_prev=0, s_v=0: new_dp0[0] +=1*1=1.

   s_v=1: new_dp0[1] +=1 *500000004.

   s_prev=1: dp0[s_prev] =500000004.

   For s_prev=1, s_v can be 0 or 1 (up to x=1):

       s_v=0:

           combined_s=1+0=1.

           ways_v =1 +0 *factor →1.

           contribution:500000004 * 1 =500000004. added to new_dp0[1].

       s_v=1:

           combined_s=1+1=2 >x=1 → skip.

   So after processing child 3:

   new_dp0[0] is 1*1 (s_prev=0, s_v=0) + ... ?

Wait, this is getting complicated. But the code should correctly compute the DP.

But according to the sample input 2, the code's output should be 13.

After processing node 1's dp0 and dp1, the sum of root_dp0[s] + root_dp1[s] for s up to 1.

root_dp0 after processing all children:

For s=0: 1 way (no selected nodes).

s=1: 500000004 * 2 ways (from selecting either child 2 or 3? Or other combinations).

But the code's final calculation will multiply by (m-1)^(n-s) = 2^(3-s) for each s.

For s=0:

ways = root_dp0[0] + root_dp1[0] → root_dp0[0] is 1, root_dp1[0] is 0 → 1.

pow_term is 2^3 =8.

So term =1 *8=8.

For s=1:

ways = root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1].

root_dp0[1] is 500000004 * 2 (from two children) → 500000004 * 2 = 1,000,000,008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.

root_dp1[1] is computed as follows:

Initially, dp1 starts with [0,1, ...].

Processing child 2:

new_dp1 after child 2:

for s_prev=1:

   for s_v=0:

       contribution =1 * v_dp0[0] (1) * factor (500000004) → 1 *1 *500000004 =500000004.

       new_s=1+0=1.

       new_dp1[1] +=500000004.

So after child 2, dp1 is [0, 500000004, 0, ...].

Processing child 3:

new_dp1 after child3:

for s_prev=1 (current dp1 is [0, 500000004, ...]):

   for s_v=0:

       contribution =500000004 *1 (v_dp0[0]) *500000004 → 500000004^2 mod MOD.

       500000004^2 = (1e9+8)/4 → 250000002000000016 mod 1e9+7 is 250000002000000016 mod 1e9+7.

But 500000004 mod MOD is 500000004.

500000004 * 500000004 = (500,000,004 * 500,000,004) mod MOD.

But 500,000,004 × 2 = 1,000,000,008 mod MOD is 1.

So 500,000,004 × 500,000,004 = (500,000,004)^2 mod MOD.

But 500,000,004 is 1/2 mod MOD. So (1/2)^2 = 1/4 mod MOD. So 1/4 is 250000002.

So, contribution for s_prev=1 and s_v=0 is 500,000,004 * 500,000,004 = 250,000,002 mod MOD.

So new_dp1[1] +=250,000,002.

So, after processing child3, new_dp1[1] =500,000,004 +250,000,002 =750,000,006 mod MOD.

Which is 750,000,006 mod 1e9+7.

But 750,000,006 is 750,000,006.

So, root_dp1[1] is 750,000,006.

So, for s=1:

ways = root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1] = 1 +750000006 → 750000007 mod MOD is 750000007 -1e9+7 = 750000007 -1,000,000,007 =-250,000,000 → mod MOD is 750,000,007.

But this is incorrect. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, after processing all children, the root's dp1[1] is 750,000,006.

The root_dp0[1] is 1.

So ways =1 +750,000,006 =750,000,007 mod MOD, which is 750,000,007 - 1e9+7 + 1e9+7 =750,000,007-1e9+7= -250,000,000 → 750,000,007 mod MOD is 750,000,007.

But 750,000,007 mod MOD is 750,000,007.

The pow_term for s=1 is 2^(3-1) =4.

So term =750,000,007 *4 mod MOD.

750,000,007 ×4 =3,000,000,028 mod MOD is 3,000,000,028 -3*1e9+7=3,000,000,028 -3,000,000,021=7.

So, term is7.

So, total is 8 +7=15. But the sample output is13.

Hmm, this suggests a mistake in the code.

But the sample input 2's expected output is 13. So, there's a mistake in the code's logic.

This indicates that the code's approach is incorrect.

But where?

The problem may be in the calculation of the factor. Let's re-examine the sample input 2.

In sample input 2, m=3, k=2, x=1.

So, factor = (k-1) / (m-1) =1/2 mod MOD.

So, factor is 500000004.

But when a node is selected (state 1), each child contributes a factor of 1/2.

But in the DP for state 1, the contribution from each child is multiplied by factor.

For example, when node 1 is selected (state 1), each child (2 and 3) must be in state 0.

But their adjacent edges contribute a factor of 1/2 each.

So, for each child, when the parent is selected, the child is not selected, and the edge contributes a factor of 1/2.

So, for node 1 selected, the contribution is:

1 (node 1) * (1 * 1/2) for child 2 * (1 *1/2) for child 3 → 1 * (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

But the code's DP for state 1 would compute this as:

Initially, after processing zero children, dp1[1] =1.

Processing child 2:

new_dp1[1] += 1 * (child 2's state0[0] * factor) →1 *1 *0.5=0.5.

So dp1 becomes [0, 0.5, ...].

Then processing child 3:

for s_prev=1 (0.5):

   s_v=0:

       contribution =0.5 *1 *0.5=0.25.

       new_s=1+0=1.

So, dp1[1] =0.25.

So, the code's dp1[1] is 0.25.

But in the code, this is represented as 250000002 mod MOD (since 0.25 mod MOD is 250000002).

So, root_dp1[1] is 250000002.

root_dp0[1] is the ways for selecting 1 node in state0. But in state0, the node is not selected. For node 1 not selected, the children can be selected or not.

But in state0, for each child, the contribution is (child's state0 + child's state1 * factor).

For node 1's state0:

after processing child 2:

dp0[0] =1 (ways to select 0 nodes when not selecting node 1 and child 2 not selected).

dp0[1] = child2's state1[1] * factor → 1 *0.5 =0.5.

Then, processing child3:

for s_prev=0:

   ways_v = child3's state0[0] + state1[0] * factor =1 +0=1.

   new_dp0[0+0] += 1 *1=1.

   ways_v for s_v=1: child3's state0[1] =0, state1[1] =1. So ways_v=0 +1*0.5=0.5.

   new_dp0[0+1] +=1*0.5=0.5.

for s_prev=0.5 (s_prev=1):

   ways_v for s_v=0: 1 +0=1.

   contribution:0.5 *1 =0.5. new_dp0[1+0=1] +=0.5 → total for s=1:0.5+0.5=1.

So, after processing child3, dp0[1] is 1.

So, root_dp0[1] is 1.

So, root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1] =1 +250000002 =250000003 mod MOD.

But 250000003 *4 (pow_term=2^(3-1)=4) is 1,000,000,012 mod MOD is 12.

Adding to the s=0 term (8) gives 20. But the sample output is13. So something is wrong.

Ah, the code's approach seems to have a mistake in the way the factors are applied.

But according to the sample input 2, the correct answer is 13, which suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the code is correct, but the factor is computed incorrectly.

Wait, the factor is (k-1) * inv(m-1) → for sample input 2, k=2, m=3 → factor is 1 * inv(2) mod MOD → 500000004.

So that's correct.

But the problem is not with the code's logic, but with how the color contributions are computed.

Let's re-express the color contributions.

The product term for a set S is:

prod = (k-1)^{adj_S} * (m-1)^{n - s - adj_S} }

Which is equal to (m-1)^{n - s} * ( (k-1)/(m-1) )^{adj_S }.

So, in code, the term (k-1/(m-1))^{adj_S} is computed via the DP, and multiplied by (m-1)^{n-s}.

But for the sample input 2, when s=0 (no selected nodes), adj_S=0.

So, the product is (m-1)^{n-0} = 2^3=8. Which is the 8 ways when no nodes are selected (each node can be type 1 or 3).

Then, when s=1 (one selected node):

For each possible selected node, the product is (k-1/(m-1))^{adj_S} → adj_S is the number of adjacent nodes to the selected node.

For example, if node 1 is selected, then adj_S is 2 (adjacent to nodes 2 and 3). So, the factor is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So, the contribution is 1/4 * 2^(3-1) = 1/4 *4=1.

But the code's DP for s=1 includes all possible ways, including when node 2 or 3 is selected.

So, the code's sum for s=1 is (1/4 + 1/2 +1/2) *4.

Wait, but no:

Wait, for each selected node S of size 1:

If node 1 is selected:

adj_S =2 (edges to 2 and 3).

prod_S = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

If node 2 is selected:

adj_S =1 (edge to 1).

prod_S =1/2.

If node 3 is selected:

adj_S=1 (edge to 1).

prod_S=1/2.

So, sum_S =1/4 + 1/2 +1/2 =1.25.

Multiply by 2^{3-1} =4 → 1.25 *4=5.

So, for s=1, the contribution is5.

For s=0, contribution is8.

Total is 8+5=13.

But according to the code's logic, the code's sum for s=1 is ways =1 (root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1] =1 +250000002=250000003 mod MOD.

250000003 *4= (250000003 *4) mod MOD=1,000,000,012 mod MOD=12.

8+12=20 mod MOD=20.

But sample input 2's output is 13. So, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

So, the code's logic must have a mistake.

Ah, I see. The code's approach computes the product of (k-1/(m-1))^{adj_S} for each selected set S. But adj_S is the number of edges between S and non-S nodes.

But for a set S where multiple nodes are selected, adj_S is the number of edges from any node in S to any node not in S.

But in the code's current approach, when multiple nodes are selected, their adjacent edges are counted correctly.

But in the sample input 2, when s=1, the code's sum for adj_S is for each selected node, the number of edges from it to non-selected nodes.

For example, if node 1 is selected, adj_S=2.

If node 2 is selected, adj_S=1.

If node3 is selected, adj_S=1.

So, the sum for s=1 should be (1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2) = 1.25.

But in the code's approach, the sum is:

root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1].

root_dp0[1] represents ways where the root is not selected, and the sum of children's selected nodes is 1.

root_dp1[1] represents ways where the root is selected, and sum of children's selected nodes is 0.

But the code's root_dp0[1] =1 (for example, two children selected once total, but root not selected).

Wait, no. root_dp0[1] is the number of ways to select 1 node in the subtree of root (not including the root), with the root not selected.

In the sample input 2, the root's children are 2 and 3.

For root_dp0[1], it's the ways where the root is not selected, and exactly 1 node is selected in the subtrees of 2 and 3.

Each child can contribute 0 or 1.

For example, child 2 selected (1 way), child 3 not selected (1 way): ways_v for child 2 is 0 + 1* factor= 500000004. For child3: 1+0=1.

So, the total ways_v for child2 and child3 would be:

child2's contribution is 500000004, child3's contribution is1.

The product is 500000004 *1 =500000004.

Which mod MOD is 500000004.

So, root_dp0[1] =500000004.

root_dp1[1] is the ways where root is selected and sum of children's selected nodes is 0.

For root selected, children 2 and 3 must be not selected. The edges contribute factor^2.

The product is 1 * (factor)^2 = (500000004)^2 = 250000002 mod MOD.

So, root_dp1[1] =250000002.

So, root_dp0[1] + root_dp1[1] =500000004 +250000002 =750000006 mod MOD.

750000006 *4 (pow_term) =3,000,000,024 mod MOD=24.

So, s=0 contributes8, s=1 contributes24, total 32 mod MOD=32.

But the sample's correct answer is 13.

This indicates that the code is incorrect.

But why?

The problem seems to be in how the code models the adjacency contributions.

Alternative approach: perhaps the code's DP is correct for the sum of (factor)^adj_S for all independent sets S of size s, but the factor is computed incorrectly.

Wait, the factor is (k-1)/(m-1). But in sample input 2, k=2, m=3, so the factor is 1/2.

But adj_S is the number of edges between S and non-S. For each such edge, the contribution is multiplied by factor.

So, for a set S of size 1:

If node 1 is selected, adj_S is 2 → factor^2 = (1/2)^2 =1/4.

If node 2 is selected, adj_S is 1 → factor^1=1/2.

If node3 is selected, adj_S is1 →1/2.

So, sum for s=1 is 1/4 +1/2 +1/2 =1.25.

Multiply by (m-1)^{n-s} =2^2=4 →1.25*4=5.

So, total for s=1 is5.

For s=0, sum is8.

Total is13.

But according to the code's calculation, the sum for s=1 is 750000006 (ways) multiplied by4 (pow_term) →750,000,006 *4=3,000,000,024 mod MOD is 24.

But 750,000,006 mod MOD is 750,000,006.

750,000,006 *4 =3,000,000,024 → 3,000,000,024 mod 1e9+7 is 3,000,000,024 - 3*(1e9+7) =3,000,000,024 -3,000,000,021=3.

So, code's term for s=1 is3.

s=0 term is8, s=1 term is3 → total 11, which is wrong.

But sample input 2's expected output is13.

So, the code's approach is wrong.

What's the issue here?

The code's root_dp0[1] is 500,000,004, which is 1/2 mod MOD.

root_dp1[1] is 250,000,002, which is 1/4 mod MOD.

sum is 750,000,006 mod MOD=750,000,006-1e9+7=750,000,006-1,000,000,007= -250,000,001 → mod MOD gives 750,000,006.

But 750,000,006 *4 mod MOD is 3,000,000,024 mod MOD=3,000,000,024-3*1e9+7*3=3,000,000,024-3,000,000,021=3.

So, the code's term for s=1 is3.

But according to the manual calculation, the term should be5.

So, the code's sum of ways is incorrect.

This suggests that the code's DP approach is not correctly capturing the adj_S for the different independent sets.

So, the mistake must be in the DP transitions.

Perhaps the code's DP for state 0 is missing some contributions.

In state0 (node not selected), the code allows children to be selected or not, but for each child selected, their edges contribute a factor.

But in the code's DP for state0:

ways_v = child's state0[s_v] + child's state1[s_v] * factor.

But for each child selected (state1), the edge between the current node and child contributes factor.

But when a child is selected (state1), the current node (state0) is not selected. So, the edge between the child and current node is part of adj_S, contributing a factor.

Yes. So, the code's state0 transition is correct.

But in the case where node 2 is selected (state1), the edge between node 1 and 2 contributes a factor of 1/2.

But node1 is not selected, so the edge (1,2) is between a selected node (2) and a non-selected node (1). So, it's part of adj_S and contributes a factor.

So, the code's handling of this case is correct.

But in the code's calculation for the sample input 2, the sum of ways for s=1 is 750,000,006, which represents 3/4 mod MOD (750,000,006 /1e9+7 is 0.75).

But 3/4 *4=3.

But according to the manual calculation, the sum should be1.25 *4=5.

This suggests that the code's DP is incorrectly calculating the sum for s=1.

But why?

Let's re-examine the code's DP for state0 and state1.

For state0 (root not selected), the code's DP0 for s=1 is 500,000,004.

Which represents the sum of all possible ways where the root is not selected and exactly one node is selected in the children's subtrees.

In this case, the possible ways are:

- child2 is selected (state1), child3 is not selected (state0).

   adj_S for this case is 1 (edge between 2 and 1).

   So, factor is 1/2.

- child3 is selected (state1), child2 is not selected (state0).

   adj_S is 1 (edge between 3 and 1).

   factor is 1/2.

So, the sum for these two cases is 1/2 +1/2=1.

But the code's DP0 for s=1 is 500,000,004 mod MOD, which is 1/2.

But this is only considering one of the two cases.

Ah, I see the mistake.

In the code's DP for state0:

for each child v, the code multiplies the current ways with the child's state0 and state1.

But for each child v, the contribution is (state0[s_v] + state1[s_v] * factor).

So, for child v=2:

state0[0] =1, state1[0] =0 → ways_v =1.

state0[1] =0, state1[1] =1 → ways_v=0 +1 * factor.

So, when processing child2, the code's new_dp0 for s=1 is 1 * (0 +1 * factor) = factor.

Then, processing child3:

for s_prev= factor (500,000,004), s_v=0:

ways_v =1 +0 =1.

new_dp0[500,000,004 +0] += 500,000,004 *1 =500,000,004.

for s_prev=500,000,004, s_v=1:

ways_v =0 +1 * factor →500,000,004.

new_dp0[500,000,004 +1] +=500,000,004 *500,000,004 →250,000,002.

But since x=1, s_prev +s_v can't exceed 1.

So, when s_prev=500,000,004 (s_prev=1), s_v can only be 0.

So, after processing child3, new_dp0[1] is 500,000,004 *1 =500,000,004.

But
