<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully and understand what's required.

The problem is about Vasya typing on a keyboard. The keyboard has some letters and shift keys. The goal is to compute the minimum number of times he has to use his other hand. The other hand is used when a character can't be typed with one hand. So for each character in the text, we need to check if it can be typed with one hand (using shift if needed) or if he needs to use the other hand.

Let me break down the problem:

First, the keyboard is given as an n x m grid. Each key is either a lowercase letter or a shift (S). To type a lowercase letter, you can press its key directly. To type an uppercase letter, you need to press a shift key plus the corresponding lowercase letter. However, when pressing two keys (like shift and a letter), the distance between them must be <=x. Also, pressing two keys is allowed only if the distance is within x. Otherwise, he can't press them with one hand and thus has to use the other hand.

So for each character in the text T, we need to check if it's possible to type it with one hand. If not, the other hand must be used, which increments the count.

The output is the total count of such uses, or -1 if any character in T is impossible to type at all.

So the steps are:

1. Preprocess the keyboard to know where each lowercase letter is located, and where the shift keys are.
2. For each character in the text T:
   a. If it's a lowercase letter: check if it exists on the keyboard. If not, return -1.
      Then, the character can be typed with one hand by pressing the key alone. So no other hand needed.
   b. If it's an uppercase letter: check if the corresponding lowercase exists. If not, return -1.
      Then, find the minimal distance between the lowercase key and any shift key. If the minimal distance is <=x, then it can be typed with one hand (using shift and the key). Otherwise, he has to use the other hand, which counts as +1.
3. Sum all the cases where the other hand is needed. If all characters are possible, return the sum. Else, return -1.

Wait, but for the uppercase letters, the existence of a shift key is also required. Because to type an uppercase, you need both a shift and the lowercase key. So even if the lowercase exists, but there are no shifts, then uppercase letters can't be typed.

So first, for each character in T:

- For lowercase c: check if there's at least one 'c' on the keyboard. If not, impossible.
- For uppercase C: check if there's at least one 'c' (lowercase) and at least one 'S' (shift) on the keyboard. If either is missing, impossible.

Then, for each uppercase character, compute the minimal distance between any 'c' (the lowercase) and any 'S' (shift). If the minimal distance is <=x, then it can be done with one hand. Otherwise, the other hand must be used once for that character.

So the approach is:

1. Preprocess the keyboard into two dictionaries:
   - letters: a dictionary mapping each lowercase character to a list of (i,j) positions.
   - shifts: a list of (i,j) positions of all 'S' keys.

2. For each character in T:
   a. If it's lowercase:
      - If not present in letters, return -1.
      - No other hand needed. Since just pressing the key with one hand.
   b. If it's uppercase:
      - Convert to lowercase, check if that letter exists in letters. If not, return -1.
      - Check if there are any shifts. If no shifts, return -1.
      - Compute the minimal distance between any of the letter's positions and any shift's positions. If the minimal distance <=x: no other hand needed. Else: add 1 to the count.

So the main challenge is efficiently computing the minimal distance between each lowercase character (when uppercase is needed) and the shifts.

But considering that n and m are up to 30, the shifts and letters' positions can be stored as lists. For each required uppercase letter, we can iterate over all possible positions of the lowercase letter and shifts, compute their distances, and find the minimal.

But wait, for each uppercase character in T, which can be up to 5e5 in quantity, and for each such character, we have to check all possible pairs of (letter_pos, shift_pos) to find the minimal distance. If the letters and shifts are stored as lists, then for each uppercase character, the time per character is O(k*l), where k is the number of positions for the lowercase letter and l is the number of shifts.

But in the worst case, say a letter has 30*30 positions (like a keyboard filled with 'a's) and shifts are 30*30 positions. Then per uppercase character, it's 900*900 = 810,000 operations. For 5e5 characters, that would be 4.05e11 operations, which is way too slow.

That's a problem. We need a way to precompute for each lowercase letter the minimal distance to any shift. Then, when processing the text, for each uppercase letter, we can just look up the precomputed minimal distance for the lowercase version of the letter.

Yes, that's the key. Precompute for each lowercase letter 'c' the minimal distance to the nearest 'S' (shift). If there are no shifts, then any uppercase letters are impossible.

So during preprocessing:

- For each lowercase letter 'c' present on the keyboard:
   compute the minimal distance between any 'c' position and any shift position. The minimal of these is the minimal distance for 'c' to any shift.

- If there are no shifts, then all uppercase letters are impossible.

So during preprocessing, create a dictionary min_dist that maps each lowercase letter to the minimal distance to any shift. If the letter is present but there are no shifts, then uppercase for that letter is impossible.

This way, for each uppercase character in T, we can quickly check if the corresponding lowercase exists and if shifts exist. Then, for the minimal distance, we can just look up min_dist[c], and compare it with x.

But how to compute min_dist[c] efficiently?

For each 'c' in letters:

   for each (i,j) in letters[c], compute the minimal distance to any (si, sj) in shifts.

Then, for each 'c', the minimal distance across all its positions and all shifts is stored as min_dist[c].

So for example, if 'c' appears in two positions, and shifts are in three positions, compute the minimal distance between any of the two and three, then take the overall minimum.

Yes.

So during preprocessing, for each lowercase letter, we need to find the minimal distance between any of its positions and any shift position.

This preprocessing step is O(total_letters * total_shifts) where total_letters is the sum over all letters of the number of positions, and total_shifts is the number of shifts.

Since n and m are up to 30, each letter can have up to 30*30 = 900 positions. And shifts can be up to 900 positions. So for each letter, 900 * 900 = 810,000 operations. But the number of letters is 26 (lowercase), so 26 * 810,000 = ~21 million operations, which is acceptable for Python, even in the time constraints.

But for the problem, when the letters are processed once, and then each of the 5e5 characters in T is handled in O(1) time.

So the preprocessing is manageable.

Now, the steps in code:

First, read the keyboard:

n, m, x = map(int, input().split())

keyboard = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Then, collect the positions of each lowercase letter and shifts.

letters = defaultdict(list)
shifts = []

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        c = keyboard[i][j]
        if c == 'S':
            shifts.append( (i,j) )
        else:
            letters[c].append( (i,j) )

Then, precompute min_dist for each lowercase letter:

min_dist = {}

for c in letters:
    min_d = float('inf')
    for (li, lj) in letters[c]:
        for (si, sj) in shifts:
            dx = li - si
            dy = lj - sj
            dist = (dx**2 + dy**2)**0.5  # Euclidean distance
            if dist < min_d:
                min_d = dist
    if min_d != float('inf'):
        min_dist[c] = min_d
    else:
        # no shifts, so any uppercase for this c is impossible
        # but since shifts is a list, if shifts is empty, then this loop is skipped, and min_d remains infinity. So in that case, min_dist[c] is not set, but during processing, if a character is uppercase, and shifts is empty, then it's impossible.

Wait, but min_dist is only computed if shifts is non-empty, right? Because if shifts is empty, then for any c in letters, the inner loop over shifts is skipped, so min_d remains infinity. Then, min_dist[c] is set to infinity only if there are shifts. Wait, no: if shifts is empty, the code for shifts is not present. So the code for min_dist[c] would not even run. Wait, no. Let's think.

The code for min_dist is:

for each c in letters:
    compute min_d as the minimal distance between any (li, lj) in letters[c] and any (si, sj) in shifts.

If shifts is empty, then for each c in letters, the inner loops over shifts don't run, so min_d remains infinity. Then, min_dist[c] would be set to infinity. But if shifts is empty, then any uppercase letters cannot be typed, regardless of min_dist.

Wait, no. Because to type an uppercase letter, you need at least one shift key. So if shifts is empty, any uppercase letters in T are impossible, so the entire text is invalid.

So during preprocessing, if shifts is empty, then we can note that, and during processing, any uppercase letters in T will cause a -1.

So back to preprocessing min_dist. If shifts is empty, then min_dist is empty, but the code for letters is still built.

So during processing T:

For each character in T:

If it's lowercase:

   if not in letters: impossible.

If it's uppercase:

   check if shifts is empty. If yes: impossible.

   else, check if the lowercase version is in letters. If not: impossible.

   else, check min_dist[lowercase]. If that minimal distance is >x: other hand is needed (count +=1)

Thus, the steps for each uppercase character are:

- check if shifts exist.

So during preprocessing, even if shifts are present, but for a certain c, the minimal distance is infinity (which would only happen if shifts are empty, but that's already handled), but in code, shifts can't be empty here.

Wait, no. For example, if a keyboard has some shifts, but a particular letter c is present but none of its positions are close enough to any shifts, then min_dist[c] would be the minimal distance, which is larger than x.

But in code, for shifts being non-empty, min_dist is computed for each c in letters. So in that case, min_dist[c] is the minimal distance between any of c's positions and any shift. If it's larger than x, then the other hand is needed.

So, in code:

precompute min_dist for each c in letters (only when shifts are non-empty).

Now, code steps:

Read T as a string.

count = 0

has_shift = len(shifts) > 0

for char in T:

    if char.islower():

        if char not in letters:

            print(-1)

            exit()

    else:

        # uppercase

        lower_char = char.lower()

        if not has_shift or lower_char not in letters:

            print(-1)

            exit()

        # check minimal distance for lower_char

        if min_dist[lower_char] > x:

            count +=1

So, the code for processing each character is O(1) per character, which is acceptable for 5e5 characters.

So the main steps are:

1. Preprocess letters and shifts.

2. Precompute min_dist for each lowercase letter, when shifts are present.

3. For each character in T:

   a. Check existence in letters (lowercase) or letters[lower] and shifts (uppercase).

   b. For uppercase, if min_dist[lower] >x, increment count.

So the code's time complexity is manageable.

Now, let's think about possible edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. No shifts on the keyboard. Then any uppercase character in T is impossible.

   For example, if T contains 'A', and keyboard has 'a' but no 'S', output is -1.

2. Some letters have no shift in reach. For example, in the first sample input:

Keyboard has a, b, c, d. No shifts. So uppercase 'A' is impossible.

3. A letter has multiple positions, some of which are within x of a shift, others not. Take the minimal distance.

4. The same shift is used for multiple letters.

But the code handles that by considering all possible pairs.

Another edge case is when the text contains a mix of possible and impossible characters. For example, if the first character is impossible, the code returns -1 immediately.

Now, let's think about how to compute the Euclidean distance between two keys.

Each key is a square with side 1. The centers are located at (i + 0.5, j + 0.5), where (i,j) is the row and column index (0-based).

Wait, the problem statement says: the keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighboring keys.

So each key is a square of size 1x1, arranged in a grid. The center of a key at row i, column j is at (i + 0.5, j + 0.5).

So when computing the distance between two keys, their centers are (i1 + 0.5, j1 + 0.5) and (i2 + 0.5, j2 + 0.5). The Euclidean distance is sqrt( (di)^2 + (dj)^2 ), where di is i1 - i2 and dj is j1 - j2. Because the centers are (i1+0.5 - (i2+0.5)) = i1 -i2 in x direction, same for y.

So in code, when calculating distance between (i,j) of a letter and (si, sj) of a shift, the distance is sqrt( (i - si)^2 + (j - sj)^2 )

Wait, no. Because for example, if the letter is at (0,0) and shift at (0,1), then the centers are (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 1.5). The distance between them is sqrt( (0.5 - 0.5)^2 + (1.5 -0.5)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 1) = 1. So the code's calculation of (i - si)^2 + (j - sj)^2 would be (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1. The square root of 1 is 1. So yes, the code's calculation is correct.

So the code correctly computes the Euclidean distance between centers.

Now, code implementation:

But considering that in Python, using floating points can be slow. However, since x can be up to 50, and the distances can be up to sqrt((30)^2 + (30)^2) ≈ 42.426, but x can be up to 50, so in some cases, even large distances may be allowed.

But in code, when comparing distance to x, we can compare the square of the distance to x squared. Because sqrt(a) <= x is equivalent to a <= x^2.

Wait, but wait: the distance is sqrt( (di)^2 + (dj)^2 ). So instead of comparing the distance <=x, we can compare (di)^2 + (dj)^2 <=x^2. Because sqrt(a) <=x iff a <=x² (since x is non-negative).

This would save the square root computation, which can speed things up. Especially since in the preprocessing step, for each possible pair of positions, we need to compute this.

Yes, this is a crucial optimization. Because square roots are computationally expensive, and for 21 million operations (as in the worst case for preprocessing), avoiding the sqrt would make the code much faster.

So, in the code, instead of computing the actual distance, compute the squared distance. Then compare to x squared.

So the code would be:

min_dist stores the minimal squared distance. Wait, no. Wait:

Wait, the original code compares the actual distance to x. But if we compute (dx^2 + dy^2) <= x², that's equivalent.

So, in the preprocessing step, for each (li, lj) and (si, sj), compute dx = li - si, dy = lj - sj. The squared distance is dx*dx + dy*dy. The actual distance is sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) <=x is equivalent to dx^2 + dy^2 <= x².

So instead of precomputing the actual distance, compute the squared distance and compare to x².

Therefore, in the preprocessing for min_dist, we can compute the squared distance and compare to x². So during preprocessing, min_dist stores the minimal squared distance for each c. Then, during processing, we check if that minimal squared distance is <= x². If not, then the other hand is needed.

This is a big optimization because it avoids computing square roots for every pair of positions.

So, modifying the code:

precompute for each c in letters:

min_sq_dist = infinity

for (li, lj) in letters[c]:

   for (si, sj) in shifts:

      dx = li - si

      dy = lj - sj

      sq_dist = dx*dx + dy*dy

      if sq_dist < min_sq_dist:

          min_sq_dist = sq_dist

if min_sq_dist is not infinity:

   min_dist[c] = min_sq_dist

Then, during processing, for each uppercase character:

if min_dist[c] > x*x:

   count +=1

So this will save a lot of computation time.

Yes, this is the way to go.

So now, the code steps are:

Read n, m, x.

Compute x_sq = x * x. Since x can be up to 50, x_sq is up to 2500.

Read the keyboard, collect letters and shifts.

If the text has any uppercase letters and shifts is empty, then impossible.

For each character in T:

lowercase:

   check if present in letters.

uppercase:

   check if shifts exist and lowercase exists.

   check if min_dist[lower_char] <= x_sq.

So in code:

x_sq = x * x

Then, during preprocessing, for each c in letters, min_dist stores the minimal squared distance to any shift.

So now, the code will be efficient.

Another optimization is that during the preprocessing for each c, once a distance of 0 is found (the same key as a shift and the letter), which is possible if the shift key is on the same key as the letter. Wait, but in the keyboard, a key can't be both a shift and a letter. Because each key is either 'S' or a lowercase letter.

So shift keys are 'S' and letters are other lowercase. So a letter's position can't be the same as a shift's position. So the minimal distance can't be zero, but perhaps in some code, but it's not possible.

But the code will handle that automatically.

Another possible optimization is that when a shift is present and the letter is present, but the minimal squared distance is larger than x_sq, then the other hand is needed.

So with this approach, the code will be efficient.

Now, let's test the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

2 2 1

ab

cd

1

A

The keyboard has no 'S's. So shifts is empty. So when processing 'A', which is uppercase, since shifts are empty, the code returns -1.

Sample 2:

Input:

2 2 1

ab

cd

1

e

The text has 'e', lowercase, which is not present on the keyboard. So code returns -1.

Sample 3:

Input:

2 2 1

ab

cS

5

abcBA

The shifts are in (1,1) (since the second row is cS, so row 1 (0-based), column 1.

Letters:

a: (0,0)

b: (0,1)

c: (1,0)

S is in (1,1).

The text is 'abcBA':

Processing each character:

a (lowercase) → exists.

b → exists.

c → exists.

B → uppercase. Lowercase is 'b', which is present. The shifts are (1,1). Compute the minimal distance between 'b' (0,1) and shift (1,1). dx is 0-1 = -1, dy 1-1=0. Squared distance: 1. x_sq is 1. So 1 <=1 → no other hand needed.

A → uppercase. Lowercase is 'a' (0,0). The shift is (1,1). dx is 0-1 = -1, dy 0-1 = -1. Squared distance: 2. x_sq is 1. So 2>1 → other hand is needed once.

So total count is 1.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 4:

3 9 4

qwertyuio

asdfghjkl

SzxcvbnmS

Text: TheQuIcKbRoWnFOXjummsovertHeLazYDOG

We need to process each character. For example, the uppercase 'T' is in the text. Lowercase 't' is not present (keyboard is 'qwertyuio' in first row, but the first row is q w e r t y u i o → letters are q, w, e, r, t, y, u, i, o. So lowercase 't' exists. The shifts are in the third row (index 2): positions (2,0) and (2,8).

The minimal distance between 't' and any shift. The 't' is in (0,4) (assuming 0-based rows and columns). Shift positions are (2,0) and (2,8).

Compute dx for (0,4) and (2,0): dx is 0-2= -2 → dx² is 4. dy is 4-0=4 → dy² is 16. Total squared distance is 20. sqrt(20) ≈4.472>4. For (2,8): dx is 0-2= -2 → dx²=4. dy=4-8= -4 → dy²=16. Total squared distance is 20. So min_sq_dist for 't' is 20. x is 4. x_sq is 16. So 20>16 → other hand is needed.

Thus, 'T' in the text requires the other hand.

The sample output says the answer is 2, which includes 'T' and 'G' in the text.

So this code will handle that.

Now, code implementation in Python.

But in Python, for 5e5 characters, it's important to process the input as efficiently as possible.

But reading the text T as input may be a problem if q is up to 5e5 and the input is read via input(). Because for very long lines, input() can be slow.

But in Python, input() is efficient for large lines. So the code can read the text with:

q = int(input())

text = input().strip()

But need to read the entire text even if q is 5e5. So the code should handle that.

Another point is that the code needs to process each character in the text. For example, checking if each character is lowercase or uppercase.

So, code steps:

Read n, m, x.

Compute x_sq = x * x.

Read the keyboard rows.

Collect letters and shifts.

If there are shifts, precompute min_sq_dist for each lowercase letter in letters.

Read q and text.

Initialize count =0.

has_shift = len(shifts) >0

for each char in text:

   if char.islower():

       if char not in letters:

           print(-1)

           exit()

   else:

       lower_char = char.lower()

       if not has_shift or lower_char not in letters:

           print(-1)

           exit()

       # check if the minimal squared distance is >x_sq

       if min_dist[lower_char] > x_sq:

           count +=1

After processing all characters, output count.

But in the case where shifts is empty, and the text contains any uppercase letters, then exit with -1.

So the code is:

Now, code:

But first, the letters are stored in a defaultdict(list), and shifts in a list.

Then, min_dist is a dictionary mapping each c to its minimal squared distance.

But for letters that have positions, but shifts are empty, min_dist is not computed, but during processing, since has_shift is False, uppercase letters are checked.

So code:

import sys
from collections import defaultdict

n, m, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
keyboard = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]
letters = defaultdict(list)
shifts = []
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        c = keyboard[i][j]
        if c == 'S':
            shifts.append((i, j))
        else:
            letters[c].append((i, j))

x_sq = x * x

min_dist = {}
has_shift = len(shifts) > 0

if has_shift:
    for c in letters:
        min_sq = float('inf')
        for li, lj in letters[c]:
            for si, sj in shifts:
                dx = li - si
                dy = lj - sj
                sq = dx * dx + dy * dy
                if sq < min_sq:
                    min_sq = sq
        if min_sq != float('inf'):
            min_dist[c] = min_sq

q = int(sys.stdin.readline())
text = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

count = 0

for char in text:
    if char.islower():
        if char not in letters:
            print(-1)
            exit()
    else:
        lower_char = char.lower()
        if not has_shift or lower_char not in letters:
            print(-1)
            exit()
        required_sq = min_dist.get(lower_char, float('inf'))
        if required_sq > x_sq:
            count +=1

print(count)

Wait, but in the code, for letters that have positions but no shifts (but since has_shift is True, because shifts is not empty), then in min_dist, for each c in letters, we have computed min_sq.

But when processing an uppercase character, lower_char is in letters (since checked), and shifts exist. So min_dist[lower_char] is present.

Wait, during preprocessing, for each c in letters, even if shifts are present, but for a c in letters, if there are no shifts (but shifts can't be empty here, because has_shift is True), but in the code, if shifts are present, then for each c in letters, the code loops over shifts. So min_sq will be the minimal distance between any of the c's positions and any shift's positions.

So min_dist[c] is set only if shifts are present.

But when processing uppercase, has_shift is True, so shifts exist. So for the uppercase character, lower_char must be in letters (since checked), and min_dist[lower_char] must exist.

So the code is correct.

But in the code, when processing an uppercase character, after checking that has_shift is True and lower_char is in letters, the code uses min_dist.get(lower_char, float('inf')). But since has_shift is True, and lower_char is in letters, then min_dist[lower_char] must have been computed.

But why? Because during the preprocessing phase, for all c in letters, when shifts are present (has_shift is True), the code computes min_sq for c and adds it to min_dist.

So in that case, lower_char is in letters, so min_dist has it. So the 'get' with default is unnecessary, but it's there to handle cases where for some reason lower_char is in letters but not in min_dist, which should not happen.

But perhaps it's better to access min_dist directly. But since we have checked that lower_char is in letters (so letters has the key), and during preprocessing, for each c in letters, min_dist[c] is added. So when shifts are present, min_dist will have all c in letters.

So the code can safely do:

required_sq = min_dist[lower_char]

Thus, the code can be adjusted for efficiency.

So changing:

        required_sq = min_dist.get(lower_char, float('inf'))

to:

        required_sq = min_dist[lower_char]

But if the code has been written correctly, this will not throw a KeyError.

But in the code, during preprocessing, for each c in letters, min_dist[c] is added. Because:

if has_shift:

    for c in letters:

        compute min_sq...

        if min_sq is not infinity (which it will be if shifts is non-empty):

            min_dist[c] = min_sq

But wait, if shifts is non-empty, but a certain c in letters has no positions where a shift exists (but shifts is non-empty), then during the computation for c, min_sq would be infinity, and thus min_dist[c] is not added. But how?

No, shifts is non-empty. For example, if a c is in letters, but all shifts are far away. For each (li, lj) in letters[c], for each shift (si, sj), compute dx and dy, compute sq. So even if all shifts are far away, the minimal sq would be the minimal among those.

But if shifts is non-empty, then for each c in letters, the code loops through all shifts. So min_sq is the minimal of all possible pairs. So if shifts is non-empty, then min_sq will be some finite value.

Wait, for example, shifts is non-empty (say, one shift), and c has positions. Then for each (li, lj) in letters[c], compute the distance to the shift. The minimal of these would be the minimal for c. So min_sq is set to that. So in this case, min_sq is finite, and thus min_dist[c] is added.

Thus, when shifts are present (has_shift is True), min_dist[c] exists for all c in letters.

Thus, in the code, for uppercase characters, after checking that lower_char is in letters, we can safely access min_dist[lower_char].

So the code can be optimized by changing that line to required_sq = min_dist[lower_char], which is faster than using get().

Thus, the code would be:

for char in text:

    if char.islower():

        if char not in letters:

            print(-1)

            exit()

    else:

        lower_char = char.lower()

        if not has_shift or lower_char not in letters:

            print(-1)

            exit()

        required_sq = min_dist[lower_char]

        if required_sq > x_sq:

            count +=1

This is safer and faster.

Testing this code with sample 1:

Sample 1: shifts is empty. So has_shift is False. For uppercase 'A', code checks has_shift (False) → exit with -1.

Sample 3: after processing, for 'B' → 'b' is in letters. shifts is present. So required_sq is the minimal squared distance for 'b'.

In code, 'b' is at (0,1). shifts is (1,1). dx is 0-1 = -1, dy is 1-1 =0. Squared distance is 1. x_sq is 1. required_sq is 1 ≤ x_sq → no count.

For 'A' → 'a' is at (0,0). shifts are (1,1). dx 0-1=-1, dy 0-1=-1. Squared distance 2. x_sq is 1. 2>1 → count +=1.

Thus, code returns 1.

Sample 4: the code correctly counts the required.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, let's handle the case where a lowercase letter exists, but there are no shifts, and the text has an uppercase letter of that.

Like, keyboard has 'a' and no 'S's. Text has 'A'. Then, since has_shift is False, the code exits with -1.

Another case: text has both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, text has 'aA', and shifts is empty. Then, 'A' is uppercase. Since shifts are empty, code exits -1.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, the code should work.
