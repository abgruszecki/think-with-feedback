Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the goal is to find out the maximum number of times the word "nineteen" can be formed by rearranging the letters of the given string. Hmm. Right, the letters can be rearranged in any order, so we need to count how many times each required character is present and see how many full "nineteen" words we can make.

First, let's think about the composition of the word "nineteen". Let's break it down letter by letter. The word is "n", "i", "n", "e", "t", "e", "e", "n". Wait, wait. Wait, no, the word "nineteen" is spelled as follows: n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n. So the letters and their counts are:

n: 3 times (positions 1, 3, 8)
i: 1
e: 3 (positions 4, 6,7)
t: 1

So for each occurrence of the word "nineteen", we need 3 n's, 1 i, 3 e's, and 1 t.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Let's count again. N-I-N-E-T-E-E-N. Yes: n appears three times, e three times, i once, t once. So yes.

So, the main idea is to count the frequency of each of these letters in the input string. Then, determine how many times we can form the word, based on the available letters.

But there's a catch here. Because the letters can be rearranged, but each occurrence of the word must be constructed from the letters. So, each occurrence requires 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t.

So, the maximum possible number of "nineteen" instances is determined by the minimum of:

count(n) // 3,
count(i),
count(e) // 3,
count(t)

But wait, that's not entirely correct. Because when the count of n is exactly 3 times the number of instances, but perhaps there's a scenario where one of the other letters is the limiting factor.

Wait, for example, suppose we have 3 n's, 1 i, 3 e's, 1 t: that's one occurrence. So the formula is correct.

But there's a special case here. Let's think: the word "nineteen" has three n's. However, after the first occurrence, maybe there's an overlap in the use of the letters? But no, because each occurrence requires all the letters again. So, each instance requires 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t.

So the maximum number of times is the minimum of (n_count //3, i_count, e_count//3, t_count).

But wait, let's take the example from the first sample input:

Input: nniinneetteeeenn → let's count the letters.

n: let's see. Let's count the letters in the input.

Original input is "nniinneetteeeenn". Let's break it down:

n: 2 (start), then another i, then n, n, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to count each letter's frequency.

n: let's see. The input has letters:

n, n, i, i, n, n, e, e, t, t, e, e, e, e, n, n.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just count each letter. Let's see:

n: let's count the number of 'n's. The sample input is nniinneetteeeenn. Let's list all letters:

n n i i n n e e t t e e e e n n → Wait, wait. Let's see:

Breaking it down:

The string is "nniinneetteeeenn".

So each character in order:

n, n, i, i, n, n, e, e, t, t, e, e, e, e, n, n. So that's 16 characters.

Count:

n: appears 6 times (positions 0,1,4,5,14,15) → total 6.

i: 2.

e: 6 (positions 6,7,10,11,12,13).

t: 2.

So, according to our formula, the maximum would be min(6//3=2, 2, 6//3=2, 2) → min(2,2,2,2) → 2. Which matches the sample output. So that works.

Another sample: the third input is "nineteenineteen". Let's see. The input is "nineteenineteen", which is two occurrences of "nineteen", but perhaps after rearrangement, we can form two instances.

Wait, the input is "nineteenineteen". Let's count letters:

n: let's see. The word "nineteen" has 3 n's. Two such words would have 6 n's, but the input here may have more?

Wait, the input is "nineteenineteen". Let's see:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n. So total letters:

n: 5? Let's count:

First "nineteen": n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n → 4 n's? Wait no, no. Wait, the word "nineteen" is 8 letters. So the first occurrence is 8 letters. Then "ineteen" would be another 7 letters. Hmm, maybe the input is a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen" which is two times "nineteen" each? But perhaps in this case, the counts are:

n: each "nineteen" has 3 n's. So two would need 6 n's. Let's check the input.

Input: "nineteenineteen". Breaking it into letters:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n. Wait, that's 15 letters. So how many n's?

Looking at each character:

Positions 0: n

2: n

7: n

9: n

14: n → Wait, that's 5 n's?

Wait, let me count again. The string is "nineteenineteen".

Breaking it down:

n i n e t e e n → that's 8 letters (positions 0-7) then i n e t e e n → 7 letters (positions 8-14). So total 15 letters.

In the first part: 3 n's (positions 0, 2, 7). In the second part, n is at position 8 (i?), wait no. Wait the second part is i n e t e e n. So positions 8-14: i (8), n (9), e (10), t (11), e (12), e (13), n (14). So n's are at 9 and 14. So total n's: first part has 3, second part 2 → total 5 n's.

So for the input "nineteenineteen", the counts are:

n: 5

i: 2 (positions 1 and 8)

e: let's see. Each 'e' in the first 'nineteen' is 3 e's (positions 4,6,7?), wait no. Let me recount:

First "nineteen" is n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n. So e's are positions 3,5,6. So 3 e's. Then in the second part, "ineteen" (assuming that's part of the input?), but in the input given, perhaps the second part is "ineteen" which is i-n-e-t-e-e-n. So e's are in positions 10, 12,13 → 3 e's. So total e's are 3+3=6.

t's: each 'nineteen' has one t, so two in total.

So the counts for the third sample input are:

n:5, i:2, e:6, t:2.

So according to our formula, the maximum is min(5//3=1, 2, 6//3=2, 2). But the sample output is 2. Wait, that's a problem. Wait this would give min(1,2,2,2) → 1, but the sample output is 2. So our initial approach is wrong.

Ah, so there's a mistake here. That's a key point. So what's the issue here?

Wait the third sample input is "nineteenineteen", which after rearrangement can form two "nineteen" instances. But according to our calculation, the counts would be:

n: let's see, the input as given: "nineteenineteen" → how many n's? Let me count again:

The input is 'n', 'i', 'n', 'e', 't', 'e', 'e', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'e', 't', 'e', 'e', 'n'.

So that's 15 characters. Now, the n's are at positions 0,2,7,9,14. So total 5 n's. So n_count is 5. So 5//3 is 1.666, but integer division gives 1. So according to our formula, the maximum is 1. But the sample output is 2.

This indicates that our initial approach is incorrect. So there must be a flaw in our reasoning.

So what's going on here? How can the third sample have 2 "nineteen" with only 5 n's?

Because each "nineteen" requires 3 n's. So two instances would require 6 n's. But 5 is less than 6. Wait, that's impossible. So there's a mistake here in counting the letters.

Wait maybe I miscounted the letters in the third sample input. Let's re-examine the third sample input.

Third sample input is "nineteenineteen". Let's write it out:

The string is "nineteenineteen".

Wait, the entire string is "nineteen" followed by "ineteen"? Or maybe "nineteen" followed by "nineteen"? Wait, perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen", which is a 15-letter string. Let's break it down:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n.

So the n's are at positions 0, 2, 7, 9, 14 → total of 5 n's.

So how can two instances be formed? Because each needs 3 n's → 3*2=6, but there are only 5. So this suggests that the sample input must have a different count. Hmm. So there's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen" which is two instances of "nineteen", but perhaps the input is written as "nineteenineteen" which is 15 letters. Let's count the letters again.

Wait "nineteen" is 8 letters. So "nineteenineteen" is 8 + 7 letters? Or perhaps the entire input is a concatenation of two "nineteen" words, but perhaps with some overlapping. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen", which is "nineteen" followed by "nineteen", but the second one is missing the first 'n'? Wait, no. Let's look at the sample input's output. The third sample's output is 2. So the input must allow for two instances.

So let's see. How can two instances be formed with 5 n's? That's impossible. So the input must have 6 n's. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the letters.

Wait let's re-express the input. "nineteenineteen" — perhaps the letters are:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n → that's 15 letters. Let's count the n's here:

- 0: n

2: n

7: n

9: n

14: n → that's 5 n's. So how can two "nineteen" be formed?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping letters. Wait, but the problem states that each occurrence must be constructed by reading the letters in order, without skipping. Wait, no. Wait the problem says, "the occurrences marked" are when you read the word in the string. But after rearrangement, the letters can be arranged in any order, so the occurrences are not overlapping. Because the letters are rearranged into a new string, and then occurrences are counted as how many times the word "nineteen" appears as a substring. So the rearrangement is allowed, but the occurrences are counted as contiguous substrings.

Wait, no. The problem statement says:

"Help her to find the maximum number of 'nineteen's that she can get in her string. For example, if she has string 'xiineteenppnnnewtnee', she can get 'xnineteenppnineteenw', containing two such words. More formally, the word 'nineteen' occurs in the string the number of times you can read it starting from some letter of the string."

So after rearrangement, the string can contain multiple non-overlapping or possibly overlapping occurrences. But the problem is that when you count the number of times the word appears, overlapping is allowed. For example, in the string "nnineteen", you can have two occurrences: the first starting at index 0, and the second starting at index 1. But the problem says that the letters must be consecutive without skipping. So each occurrence is a consecutive substring equal to "nineteen".

But when you rearrange the letters, the maximum possible number of occurrences is the maximum possible number of non-overlapping or overlapping occurrences. But in reality, the maximum possible is determined by the counts of the letters.

But this seems conflicting with the first example. For example, the first sample input has 6 n's. So for two "nineteen" instances, each requires 3 n's → total 6. So that's allowed. So why in the third sample, with 5 n's, can they form two instances?

Ah, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the required letters for each occurrence.

Wait, let's re-examine the word "nineteen". The letters are n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n. So that's 8 letters. The letters are arranged in order. So each occurrence requires exactly these letters in sequence. But after rearrangement, the letters can be arranged in any order. Wait, no! Wait, the problem says that Alice can rearrange the letters in any order. Then, the maximum number of "nineteen" occurrences is the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences of the word in the rearranged string.

But since she can arrange the letters in any order, the problem reduces to how many times the letters can form the required letters. Because after rearrangement, the letters can be arranged as multiple consecutive "nineteen" strings. For example, if there are 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t, then the rearranged string could be "nineteen", which gives one occurrence. If there are 6n, 2i, 6e, 2t, then the rearranged string could be "nineteennineteen", which gives two occurrences. So the count is determined by how many times the required letters are present.

But each occurrence requires 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t. So the maximum possible is the minimum of (n_count //3, i_count, e_count//3, t_count). But the third sample input's output is 2, which according to that formula would require 3*2=6 n's. So where's the discrepancy?

In the third sample input, the output is 2. So according to the problem, the input must have enough letters to form two instances. Let's check the input again.

Third sample input: "nineteenineteen". Let's count the letters again.

Original string: "nineteenineteen". Let's split into letters:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n.

Wait, that's 15 characters. Let's count the letters:

n: positions 0, 2, 7, 9, 14 → total 5? Wait 0,2,7,9,14: that's 5 n's. So 5 n's.

But two instances require 3*2=6 n's. So that's impossible. So why does the sample output say 2?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's count again.

Looking at the input "nineteenineteen" as a string:

n i n e t e e n i n e t e e n → that's 15 characters.

Now, n occurs at positions 0,2,7,9,14. So that's 5 n's. So why can the answer be 2?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the third sample input is not "nineteenineteen" but "nineteenineteen" (maybe with more letters). Let's check the sample input given. Oh, the third sample input is "nineteenineteen". Let's write the letters again:

nineteenineteen → breaking into letters:

n i n e t e e n i n e t e e n → Wait, no, that's not 15 letters. Let's see: "nineteen" is 8 letters, then "ineteen" is 7 letters. So total 8+7=15 letters. Let's list them:

n (0), i (1), n (2), e (3), t (4), e (5), e (6), n (7), i (8), n (9), e (10), t (11), e (12), e (13), n (14).

So n's are at 0,2,7,9,14 → 5 times. So count(n) is 5. So according to our initial formula, max possible is 5//3=1. So why is the sample output 2?

This suggests that our initial approach is wrong. So what's the error here?

Ah! Wait, maybe the word "nineteen" requires 3 n's per occurrence. However, perhaps in some cases, when you have exactly one more n, you can get an extra occurrence. Wait, but how?

Wait, let's think differently. The word "nineteen" has three n's. But when you have two occurrences, you need 6 n's. But the third sample input has 5 n's. So how can this form two instances? That's impossible.

Unless the problem allows overlapping n's. Wait, but each occurrence requires three distinct n's. No. Because after rearrangement, the letters are arranged in any order. So if you have 5 n's, the maximum possible is 5//3 = 1 occurrence. But sample 3's output is 2. So there's a contradiction here.

Therefore, our initial approach must be wrong. So where's the mistake?

Ah! Oh wait, wait. Let's look at the word "nineteen" again. The word is spelled as n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n. So there are three n's. So each occurrence requires three n's. But perhaps the first occurrence uses three n's, and the second occurrence uses the remaining two n's? No, that's impossible. Because each occurrence needs three.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the occurrences as overlapping in the use of letters. For example, if the rearranged string is "nnineteen", the first occurrence starts at the first n (using the first three n's) and the second starts at the second n (using the second and third n's plus another). But that's impossible because the word requires three n's in a row. Wait, no. The word "nineteen" is eight letters long. So in "nnineteen", the first occurrence starts at index 0 (n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n) but there's only two n's at the beginning. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the letters are counted. For example, the third sample input may have 6 n's. Let's re-examine:

Third sample input is "nineteenineteen".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an 'n'. Let's count again:

The input is "nineteenineteen".

Breaking it down:

n i n e t e e n → that's the first "nineteen" (8 letters), then i n e t e e n → 7 letters. So total letters: 15.

In the first part (positions 0-7): n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n → three n's.

In the second part (positions 8-14): i, n, e, t, e, e, n → two n's.

So total n's: 3 + 2 =5.

Hmm. So no, that's correct.

But the sample output is 2. So how is this possible?

Ah! Here's the key. Let's think differently: the word "nineteen" has three n's, but the count of n's required per occurrence is not exactly three. Wait, perhaps the problem has a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the first occurrence of "nineteen" uses three n's, but the second occurrence can use two n's from the first occurrence plus one new. But that's not possible because each occurrence must be formed by distinct letters.

No. Because when you rearrange the letters, each occurrence is formed by using the letters exactly once. So all letters are used in the string once, and each occurrence must be formed by using letters from the entire pool.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that after rearrangement, the string is formed, and the number of "nineteen" occurrences is how many times the substring appears. But when you rearrange the letters, you can arrange them in such a way that multiple overlapping occurrences can share some letters.

For example, suppose you have 4 n's, 1 i, 3 e, 1 t. Then, you can arrange as "nnineteen...", but the first occurrence uses the first three n's, and the next occurrence uses the fourth n and two others? But that's impossible. Each occurrence requires three n's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you have 3n + 1n, you can form two occurrences by using the first three n's and then overlapping the last n with two others from the first occurrence. But that's impossible.

So how can the third sample's output be 2 with 5 n's?

Wait, perhaps the counts in the third sample are different. Let's re-calculate the counts for the third sample input.

Input: "nineteenineteen".

Let me write down each character:

n → count n: 1

i → count i: 1

n → count n: 2

e → count e:1

t → count t:1

e → count e:2

e → count e:3

n → count n:3

i → count i:2

n → count n:4

e → count e:4

t → count t:2

e → count e:5

e → count e:6

n → count n:5.

So, yes, n_count=5, i_count=2, e_count=6, t_count=2.

So according to the initial formula, the maximum is min(5//3=1, 2, 6//3=2, 2) → 1. But the sample output is 2. So clearly, the initial approach is wrong.

Hmm. So what's the correct approach here?

Alternative idea: perhaps there's a special case when the number of e's and other letters are sufficient, but the number of n's is exactly one more than 3*k. For example, if n_count is 3k +1, then it's possible to arrange the letters such that the first occurrence uses 3 n's, and the next occurrence uses the remaining n's plus the last n from the previous occurrence. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the count of n's is not the limiting factor when there's a specific condition. Let's think about the problem again.

The word "nineteen" has three n's, but when you have multiple occurrences, the arrangement could be such that the last n of one occurrence is used as the first n of the next occurrence. For example, if you have the string "nnineteen", the first occurrence starts at index 0 (n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n), and the next occurrence starts at index 1 (n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n), but that would require overlapping letters. But in this case, the second occurrence would require letters that are already used in the first occurrence. But the problem says that the letters are arranged once, and the occurrences are counted as substrings. So in the example, after rearrangement, the string can be arranged in such a way that the substrings overlap. For example, "nineteen" followed by another "teen" part. But that's not possible unless there are enough letters.

But this would require that the letters are arranged in a way that allows overlapping. However, the total number of letters must be sufficient to form all occurrences. For example, each occurrence requires 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t. But if overlapping is allowed, perhaps some letters can be reused. But that's not the case. Because each letter in the input string is part of exactly one occurrence. So, for example, the total number of letters in the input string must be at least 8*k, where k is the number of occurrences. But since the problem allows rearrangement, the letters can be arranged in any order. So overlapping is not possible because each letter can be part of only one occurrence.

Wait, but in the sample input where the output is 2, perhaps the letters are arranged in such a way that the n's are shared between occurrences. But that's not possible because each occurrence requires three distinct n's.

So this brings us back to the original problem: why does the third sample input have an output of 2 when the n_count is 5?

Ah! I think I see the mistake. Let me re-examine the word "nineteen" again. Wait, the word is spelled as N-I-N-E-T-E-E-N, which is eight letters. So each occurrence requires 3n's, 1i, 3e's, and 1t. So for two occurrences, we need 6n's, 2i's, 6e's, 2t's.

In the third sample input:

n_count =5 → insufficient for two occurrences. But the sample output is 2. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the required n's per occurrence is not 3. Let me re-count the letters in the word "nineteen".

Yes:

n (1), i (1), n (2), e (1), t (1), e (2), e (3), n (3). So three n's, three e's, one i, one t. So per occurrence, 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t.

But sample 3's input has 5n's, 2i's, 6e's, 2t's. So for two occurrences, you need 6n's (3*2), but the input has 5n's. So the maximum possible should be 1. But the sample output is 2. So this is a contradiction.

But the sample output is correct. So there must be a mistake in my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not to count the number of times the word "nineteen" appears as a substring in the rearranged string, but to count how many times the letters can form the word, regardless of order. But that's not what the problem states.

The problem statement says: "the maximum number of such words as possible. For that reason she can rearrange the letters of the string."

So Alice can rearrange the letters in any order. Then, the string may contain multiple occurrences of "nineteen" as substrings, but each occurrence must be contiguous and in order.

So for example, if she has sufficient letters for two occurrences, she can arrange the letters as "nineteennineteen", which has two occurrences.

But each occurrence requires exactly 3n, 1i, 3e, 1t.

So the third sample input's output being 2 must have sufficient letters.

So perhaps the initial counting of the third sample's letters is incorrect.

Let me re-examine the third sample input: "nineteenineteen".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an 'n' in the input. Let's see:

The input is "nineteenineteen".

Wait, "nineteen" is 8 letters. Then "ineteen" is 7 letters. Wait, but perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen" → which is "nineteen" + "n" + "ineteen"? Or perhaps the input has a typo. But according to the sample, it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is "nineteenineteen" which is 15 letters, but the actual letters are:

n: 6 times.

Let's see: the input is "nineteenineteen". Let's split into letters:

n, i, n, e, t, e, e, n → first "nineteen" (8 letters).

Then i, n, e, t, e, e, n → second part (7 letters).

So n's in the first part: positions 0, 2, 7 → 3.

In the second part: positions 1 (i?), no. Wait the second part is i, n, e, t, e, e, n. So the second part has two n's: positions 1 (n?), no. Let's list the second part letters:

i (first letter of the second part?), n, e, t, e, e, n.

So the second part has n's at positions 1 and 6 (of the second part). So in the entire input, after the first 8 letters, the next 7 letters have two n's. So total n's: 3+2=5. So yes, the n_count is 5.

But sample output is 2. So how can this be?

This suggests that there is a flaw in the initial approach. So what's the correct way to calculate the maximum number of "nineteen" occurrences?

Alternative idea: perhaps the first occurrence uses three n's, and the second occurrence uses two n's from the first occurrence plus a new one. But that's impossible, because each occurrence must have three distinct n's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the use of n's in a different way. For example, the first occurrence uses three n's, the second occurrence requires three n's. But if there's a total of five n's, then the maximum possible is 1.

But the sample output is 2. So there's a contradiction here.

So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or perhaps there's a different way to model the problem.

Let me think differently. Perhaps the word "nineteen" requires only two n's per occurrence. Let's recheck:

n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n → three n's. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the 'n's in the word as two. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping letters in the counts. For example, if after rearrangement, the letters are arranged in a way that allows overlapping occurrences. For example, "nineteen" can have two occurrences if the string is "nineteennine" but that's impossible with the given letters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the count of n's can be 3k - 1 plus 1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the third sample input. The output is 2. So according to the problem's sample, the maximum possible is 2. So we need to find a way that with 5 n's, two occurrences are possible.

So how?

Ah! Perhaps the first occurrence uses three n's, and the second occurrence uses two n's from the first occurrence and one from elsewhere. But that's not possible, because each occurrence must be made up of distinct letters. No. Once you use a letter in an occurrence, you can't use it again in another.

Wait, but the letters are arranged once. So each letter in the string is part of exactly one occurrence. So the letters are arranged into a string, and each occurrence is a contiguous substring. But for overlapping occurrences, letters are shared. For example, if the string is "nineteennine", but then the first occurrence is "nineteen" and the second starts at index 1. But in that case, the letters are shared between the two occurrences. But how can the letters be sufficient? For example, each occurrence requires 3n's. So two occurrences would need 6n's, but if they share two n's, then total n's needed is 3 +3 -2 =4. But this is not the case here.

But this line of thinking is getting complicated. Perhaps there's a different approach here.

Alternative approach: the problem requires that the letters can be arranged to form as many "nineteen" as possible, but each occurrence must be a contiguous substring. So the key is to determine how many times the letters can form the required letters for each occurrence.

But the letters are rearranged into any order, so the optimal way is to arrange the letters into consecutive "nineteen" blocks. So the maximum possible number of occurrences is determined by the letters available.

But the third sample input's output is 2. So for that, the counts must be:

n: 5 → 5 >= 3*2 - 1. Wait, what's 3*2-1? 5. So maybe when the number of n's is exactly 3*k-1, then it's possible to form k occurrences if there's at least one more n.

Wait, no. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the first occurrence uses 3 n's, and the second occurrence uses 2 n's. But that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the required n's is (number_of_occurrences * 3 - (number_of_occurrences-1)). So for two occurrences: 3*2 -1 =5. So that fits the third sample's 5 n's.

But why? Because in the rearranged string, the occurrences are arranged consecutively, allowing the last n of the first occurrence to be the first n of the second occurrence.

For example, "nnineteen" → the first occurrence is "nineteen" (n-i-n-e-t-e-e-n) → but that's 8 letters. The next occurrence would start at the second n. But that's not possible because the second occurrence needs three n's. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, if the rearranged string is "nnnineteeneteen" → but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the first occurrence to use three n's, and the second occurrence to use two n's from the first occurrence plus one from elsewhere. But that would require overlapping letters, which is not allowed.

Hmm. This is confusing. So perhaps there's a different way to model the problem.

Let me think of the required letters per occurrence.

Each occurrence requires:

n:3

i:1

e:3

t:1

So for k occurrences:

n_total >= 3*k

i_total >=k

e_total >=3*k

t_total >=k

But in the third sample input, the n_total is 5. So 3*k ≤5 →k can be 1 (3*1=3 ≤5) or 1.666 →k=1. So maximum possible is 1. But sample output is 2.

So why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for n is (k * 3) - (k-1). So for k=2, required n's are 3*2 -1 =5. Which matches the third sample's 5 n's.

So why would this be the case?

Because the last n of the first occurrence can be reused as the first n of the second occurrence.

For example, in the string "nineteenineteen", the first occurrence uses 3 n's, and the second occurrence uses two new n's plus the last n from the first occurrence. So for two occurrences, the total n's needed would be 3 +2=5.

This way, the required n's per occurrence is 3 for the first, and 2 for the subsequent ones. So for k occurrences, the required n's is 3 + 2*(k-1) = 2k +1.

But how does that fit with the problem's examples?

Third sample input has 5 n's. So solving 2k+1 ≤5 → 2k ≤4 →k=2. So that's why the sample output is 2.

But how is this possible? Because the occurrences can share one n between them.

But how does that work in the rearranged string? For example, the rearranged string would be "nineteeninteen", but how would that form two occurrences? Let's see:

The first occurrence is "nineteen", which uses 3n's. The second occurrence starts at the third n. But the second occurrence's n's would need to be the third n from the first occurrence plus two new ones. But the second occurrence would require three n's. So in this case, the second occurrence would have n's at positions 2, 3, 7 (assuming the string is arranged as "nineteninteen", but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the required number of n's is 2*k +1. So for k=2, that's 5 n's. Which fits the third sample. So the formula for the maximum possible k is:

k = min( (n_count +1)//2, i_count, e_count//3, t_count )

So for the third sample, (5+1)/2=3 → but the other letters may limit to 2.

Wait, but in the third sample, e_count is 6 → 6//3=2. So the maximum k is min(3, 2, 2, 2) →2. Which matches the sample.

So the formula for n_count is (k) = floor( (n_count +1) / 2 )

But why? Because each occurrence after the first requires two new n's.

For example, the first occurrence uses 3 n's. The second uses 2 new n's and one from the previous occurrence. So for k occurrences, the required n's is 3 + 2*(k-1) = 2k +1.

But 2k+1 must be ≤ n_count.

So solving for k:

2k+1 ≤n_count →k ≤ (n_count-1)/2 → floor((n_count-1)/2).

But for n_count=5:

(5-1)/2=2 →k=2.

Which fits the sample.

So the correct formula for the maximum k is:

k = min( floor( (n_count-1)/2 ), i_count, floor(e_count/3), t_count )

Wait, but let's test this formula against the samples.

First sample:

n_count=6 → (6-1)/2=2.5 → floor to 2. i_count=2, e_count=6//3=2, t_count=2. So min(2,2,2,2)=2 → correct.

Third sample: n_count=5 → (5-1)/2=2 → min(2,2,2,2)=2 → correct.

Second sample: the input is "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii". Let's count the letters:

The input is repeated "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii". Let's see:

But perhaps in this input, the counts are:

n: let's see. The input seems to have multiple parts of "nneteen". For example, "nnet" would contribute two n's. Each "nneteenabcnneteenab..." part has two n's. So perhaps the total n's are 5*2=10? Or maybe not. The sample output is 2. Let's assume that the formula gives:

n_count=10 → (10-1)/2=4.5 → floor to4. But other letters may limit to 2.

But in any case, the correct approach is to model the required n's as 2k+1 ≤n_count.

So the formula for the maximum number of occurrences is the minimum of:

min( (n_count -1) // 2, i_count, e_count //3, t_count )

But we need to verify this.

Another example: if n_count=3 → (3-1)/2=1 → max k=1.

Which is correct, since one occurrence.

If n_count=5 → allows two occurrences.

Another example: n_count=4 → (4-1)/2=1.5 → floor to1. So max k=1.

But what if we have 4 n's, 2i, 3e, 2t. Then according to the formula, k=1. But according to the original formula, it's min(4//3=1, 2, 1, 2) →1. So same result.

But what if n_count=5, i=3, e=6, t=3. Then according to the new formula, k=2. Which is correct.

So this suggests that the correct formula is to take the minimum between floor( (n_count -1)/2 ), i_count, e_count//3, and t_count.

But why is this the case?

Because each occurrence after the first requires two new n's. The first occurrence uses three n's, and each subsequent occurrence uses two new n's. So for k occurrences, the required n's are 3 + 2*(k-1) = 2k +1. So 2k+1 ≤n_count →k ≤ (n_count-1)/2.

Thus, the maximum possible k is floor( (n_count-1)/2 ), but also must be limited by the other letters.

So the correct formula is:

k = min( (n_count-1)//2, i_count, e_count//3, t_count )

Wait, but what about when the required n's is 3 for k=1?

For example, if n_count=3, then (3-1)/2=1 → floor is 1. So k=1. Which is correct.

If n_count=2 → (2-1)/2=0.5 → floor is0 → k=0.

If n_count=4 → (4-1)/2=1.5 →1.

So for 4 n's, the maximum possible is 1 occurrence (since 3+2*0=3 ≤4 → yes). But according to the new formula, k=1. But 3+2*(k-1)=3+0=3 ≤4. Yes. So it's correct.

So this new formula for the maximum number of 'nineteen's is:

k = min( (n_count -1) //2, i_count, e_count//3, t_count )

But why is this the case?

Because the first occurrence requires three n's, and each subsequent occurrence requires two additional n's. So for k occurrences, the required n's are 3 + 2*(k-1) = 2k +1.

So 2k+1 ≤n_count →k ≤ (n_count-1)/2.

Thus, the maximum possible k is (n_count-1)//2.

But wait, what if n_count=5, then (5-1)//2=2, which gives 2k+1=5 →5 ≤5. Which is correct.

But in the third sample, the n_count=5, which allows two occurrences according to this formula. And the other letters are sufficient.

So this seems to be the correct approach.

So the problem requires this different approach for the n_count.

Thus, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Count the occurrences of each letter 'n', 'i', 'e', 't' in the input string.

2. For 'e', compute e_count //3.

3. For 'n', compute (n_count -1) // 2.

4. The maximum number of 'nineteen' is the minimum of these four values: (n-1)/2, i, e//3, t.

But wait, let's test this with the third sample.

Third sample:

n=5, i=2, e=6, t=2.

(n-1)//2 = (5-1)/2=2.

i=2.

e//3=6/3=2.

t=2.

min(2,2,2,2)=2. Correct.

First sample:

n=6 → (6-1)/2=2.5 →2.

i=2.

e=6/3=2.

t=2.

min(2,2,2,2)=2. Correct.

Another example: input has n=3, i=1, e=3, t=1.

(n-1)/2=1.

i=1.

e=1.

t=1.

min(1,1,1,1)=1. Correct.

Another example: n=4, i=2, e=3, t=1.

(n-1)/2=1.5 →1.

i=2.

e=1.

t=1.

min(1,2,1,1)=1. Correct.

So this formula works.

Thus, the correct approach is to compute the minimum between (n_count-1)//2, i_count, e_count//3, t_count.

But wait, what if the (n_count-1)//2 is less than zero? For example, n_count=0. But in the input, if there are no n's, then no 'nineteen' can be formed. So the formula would correctly return zero.

So this is the correct formula.

So the steps for the solution are:

1. Count the frequency of each character in the input string for 'n', 'i', 'e', 't'.

2. Compute the maximum possible occurrences as:

max_occurrences = min( (n_count -1)//2, i_count, e_count//3, t_count )

But wait, why (n_count-1) //2? Because the first occurrence uses 3 n's, and each subsequent occurrence uses 2 n's. So for k occurrences, the required n's are 3 + 2*(k-1) = 2k +1. So k can be up to (n_count-1) //2.

But what if the maximum is zero?

For example, if any of the required letters are zero.

So in code:

counts = {'n':0, 'i':0, 'e':0, 't':0}

for char in s:

    if char in counts:

        counts[char] +=1

n = counts['n']

i = counts['i']

e = counts['e']

t = counts['t']

max_n = (n-1) // 2 if n >=1 else 0

max_e = e //3

possible = min( max_n, i, max_e, t )

But wait, when n is 0, (n-1) is -1, and divided by 2 is -1//2 = -1. So min would take the minimum between -1 and the others. But since other counts are zero, the possible is zero.

So the code can be written as:

max_n = (n-1) // 2

possible = min( max_n, i, e//3, t )

But if n is zero, then (0-1)//2= (-1)//2= -1. So possible could be -1, which is wrong. So we need to ensure that max_n is at least zero.

So the correct way is to compute max_n as max(0, (n-1)//2 ), but wait, no.

Because if n is 0, then (n-1)//2 is -1, but the possible is min(-1, ...). Which would be -1, but we have to return 0. So we need to take max(0, (n-1)//2 ).

So the code should be:

max_n = (n - 1) // 2

max_n = max(0, max_n)

possible = min( max_n, i, e//3, t )

Yes. Because if n is 0, then max_n = (0-1)//2 = -1//2= -1. Then max(0, -1) →0. So possible is min(0, ...) →0.

So this covers all cases.

Thus, the correct code is to compute:

max_possible = min( max( (n_count-1)//2, 0 ), i_count, e_count//3, t_count )

So this is the approach.

Now, let's test this approach with the third sample:

n=5 → (5-1)//2=2 → max_n=2.

i=2.

e=6 →6//3=2.

t=2.

min(2,2,2,2)=2. Correct.

Another example: n=3 → (3-1)/2=1 →1. So possible min(1, i, e, t).

Yes.

Another example: n=2 → (2-1)//2=0.5 →0 (integer division). So max_n=0. So possible min(0, ...) →0.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, the steps to solve the problem are:

- Count the letters 'n', 'i', 'e', 't' in the input string.

- Compute the maximum possible 'n' contributions as (n-1)//2, but not less than zero.

- The maximum number of 'nineteen's is the minimum between this max_n, i_count, e//3, and t_count.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read the input string.

Count the letters.

Compute the variables.

Return the minimum of the four values.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

The code would be:

s = input().strip()

n_count = s.count('n')
i_count = s.count('i')
e_count = s.count('e')
t_count = s.count('t')

max_n = (n_count -1) // 2 if n_count > 0 else 0
max_e = e_count //3

possible = min( max_n, i_count, max_e, t_count )

print( possible if possible >=0 else 0 )

Wait, but what if n_count is 0, then max_n is 0. So possible is min(0, ...) →0.

But what about other letters? For example, if there are no n's, even if other letters are present, possible is zero.

So that's correct.

Testing the third sample:

Input is 'nineteenineteen'.

n_count =5.

max_n = (5-1)//2 =2.

i_count=2.

e_count=6 →6//3=2.

t_count=2.

possible = min(2,2,2,2)=2. Correct.

Sample input 2: "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii".

Let's compute the counts:

n_count: let's see, the input contains multiple 'n's.

But in the input, each occurrence of "nneteen" has two 'n's. Let's see how many times "nneteen" appears. But perhaps it's easier to count all 'n's in the input.

Assuming the input is "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii".

Let's count the 'n's:

Each "nneteen" has two 'n's.

The input has "nneteen" repeated 5 times? So 2*5=10 n's.

i_count: each "nneteen" has one 'i', but the input has "abcii" at the end. So i_count is 5*1 +2=7? Not sure, but the sample output is 2. So according to the code:

max_n = (10-1)//2=9//2=4.

i_count=7.

e_count: each "nneteen" has 3 e's (from the 'teen' part). So 5*3=15 e's. So e_count//3=5.

t_count: each "nneteen" has one t. So 5*1=5.

possible = min(4,7,5,5) →4. But the sample output is 2.

So this contradicts the code.

Wait, sample input 2's output is 2. So according to the code, the code would output 4, but sample output is 2. So there's a mistake here.

Ah! So the code is incorrect. So what's wrong here.

Wait, sample input 2's output is 2, which suggests that the code's logic is wrong.

So what's the problem with sample input 2?

Let's look at sample input 2:

Input: "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii"

Wait, perhaps the counts of the letters are as follows:

n_count: let's see, each "nneteen" has two n's. The input has "nneteen" repeated five times → 2*5=10 n's. Then, the 'abcnneteen' parts may have additional n's. But this depends on the exact input.

But the sample output is 2, so according to the code, the possible is min( (10-1)//2=4, i_count, e_count//3, t_count).

But the sample output is 2, which is lower than 4. So one of the other counts must be the limiting factor.

So in sample input 2, the limiting factor is i_count, e_count//3, or t_count.

So perhaps in sample input 2, the i_count is 2, e_count//3 is 2, or t_count is 2.

So let's assume that the input is structured as follows:

Each "nneteenabc" part. So the input is "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii".

Breaking down:

Each "nneteenabc" part has two n's, two e's (wait, no. Let's look at the word "nneteen".

The word "nneteen" is n-n-e-t-e-e-n. So letters: 3n's? Or no.

Wait, "nneteen" is n, n, e, t, e, e, n. So that's 7 letters. So three n's, three e's, one t.

Wait, so each "nneteen" part has three n's, three e's, one t.

But the input is "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii".

So each "nneteenabc" part has "nneteen" (3n, 3e, 1t) followed by 'abc'.

So the total n's would be 3 *5=15 (since there are five "nneteen" parts?), but the sample output is 2.

But according to the code, with n_count=15, max_n=(15-1)//2=7. So possible is min(7, i_count, e_count//3, t_count).

But sample output is 2. So one of the other counts is 2.

For example, suppose the i_count is 2. Then the possible is 2.

So how?

Looking at the input sample 2:

The input ends with "abcii", which contributes two i's. So i_count would be 5 (from each "nneteen" part) +2=7? Or perhaps each "nneteen" part has one i.

Wait, the word "nneteen" does not contain any i's. The 'i's are only in the "teen" part of "nneteen". Wait, no. The word "nneteen" is n-n-e-t-e-e-n. So no 'i's.

So the i's in the input sample 2 are in the "abcii" part. So the total i_count is 2.

Because in the input sample 2, the input is "nneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcnneteenabcii".

So the 'i's are in the last part: "abcii" → two i's.

So i_count=2.

Thus, the code would compute possible = min( (15-1)//2=7, 2, e_count//3, t_count).

Thus, the minimum is 2, which matches the sample output.

So the code would correctly output 2.

So why is this the case?

Because the i_count is 2, which is the limiting factor.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, the code is:

s = input().strip()

n_count = s.count('n')
i_count = s.count('i')
e_count = s.count('e')
t_count = s.count('t')

max_n = (n_count - 1) // 2 if n_count >= 1 else 0
max_e = e_count // 3

possible = min(max_n, i_count, max_e, t_count)
possible = max(possible, 0)  # Ensure it's not negative

print(possible)

But in Python, when n_count is 0, (n_count -1) // 2 is (-1) // 2 = -1. So max_n is set to (n_count -1)//2 if n_count >=1. But when n_count is 0, it's set to 0.

Wait, the code currently calculates max_n as (n_count -1) // 2 if n_count >=1 else 0. But in Python, this would be written with a ternary operator.

Alternatively, compute max_n as:

max_n = (n_count - 1) // 2 if n_count >= 1 else 0

But for n_count=1, (1-1)//2=0 → correct.

For n_count=0 →0.

But this can be written more simply as:

max_n = (n_count -1) // 2

if max_n <0:

    max_n =0

Or in a single line:

max_n = max( (n_count -1) // 2, 0 )

Because if (n_count -1) //2 is negative, max(...,0) sets it to zero.

Thus, the code can be written as:

n_count = s.count('n')

max_n = max( (n_count -1) // 2, 0 )

Then, possible is min(max_n, i_count, e_count//3, t_count).

Thus, the code becomes:

s = input().strip()

n_count = s.count('n')
i_count = s.count('i')
e_count = s.count('e')
t_count = s.count('t')

max_n = max( (n_count - 1) // 2, 0 )
max_e = e_count // 3

possible = min(max_n, i_count, max_e, t_count)

print(possible)

This should handle all cases correctly.

Thus, this is the correct code.
