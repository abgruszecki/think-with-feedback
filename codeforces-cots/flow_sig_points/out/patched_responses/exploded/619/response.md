<think>
Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to find the number of arrays of length n where the sum is between l and r, and the XOR of all elements is z. Hmm. Let me think.

First, the constraints are tight. n can be up to 1000, and l and r are up to 1e18. So a brute force approach is impossible. We need a dynamic programming approach, probably with some bitwise properties.

Let me start by understanding the problem conditions. For the array a_1 to a_n, two conditions must hold:
1. The sum S = a_1 + ... + a_n is between l and r.
2. The XOR X = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_n equals z.

The challenge is to count all such arrays efficiently.

I remember that for XOR problems, considering the bits of the numbers can be helpful. Also, the sum and XOR have some relations. For example, the sum S can be written as X + 2*B, where B is the sum of the carries generated in each bit when adding the numbers. But how does that help here?

Wait, the XOR and sum are connected. For each bit, the parity of the number of elements that have that bit set is determined by the XOR. For the sum, the bits contribute based on their position. So maybe we can model the problem bit by bit, keeping track of the carry-over in each position.

This sounds similar to some digit DP problems where you process each bit and track certain state. The idea is to process each bit from the least significant to the most, considering the constraints on the sum and XOR.

Let's think about the XOR first. For the XOR of all elements to be z, each bit in z must match the parity of the count of elements that have that bit set. For example, if the k-th bit in z is 1, then an odd number of elements must have that bit set. If it's 0, even.

But how does this affect the sum? Each bit contributes 2^k multiplied by the number of elements that have that bit set, but with possible carry-over from lower bits. Oh right, because when you sum the bits, each higher bit can carry over from the lower bits.

So the sum S must be equal to X (the XOR) plus twice the sum of the carry bits. Wait, not exactly. Because when you add numbers, the sum of the bits at position k is the number of elements with that bit set, plus the carry from the lower bits. Then, the current bit in the sum is (sum_k + carry_in) mod 2, and the carry_out is (sum_k + carry_in) // 2. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem as a DP that, for each bit position, tracks the required carry. Let's think in terms of bits. For each bit from 0 to, say, 60 (since 1e18 is about 2^60), we process the bits of the sum and the XOR.

But the XOR is fixed as z. So for each bit in z, we know how many elements have that bit set. Let's say the current bit is b. Then, the number of elements with this bit set must be of parity equal to the b-th bit of z. For example, if z's b-th bit is 1, then the count of elements with that bit set is odd.

Now, the sum's bits are influenced by the elements' bits and the carries from lower bits. So the sum's binary representation is determined by the bits of all elements plus the carry-in.

Wait, but the sum S must be between l and r. However, directly computing the sum's bits is tricky because it's a global condition. So perhaps we can compute the number of arrays where the sum is <= r, subtract those where the sum is < l, and then modulo 1e9+7.

That's a common technique to handle ranges: compute f(r) - f(l-1) mod MOD.

So the plan is to compute the number of valid arrays with sum <= upper and subtract the number of arrays with sum < lower.

Now, the problem reduces to, for a given upper limit s (like r or l-1), compute the number of arrays a_1 ... a_n where sum(a_i) <= s and XOR(a_i) = z.

Now, how to compute this count for a given s?

Let me think about dynamic programming here. For each bit position from 0 to, say, 60, we track the carry-over from the lower bits. Because when you process the bits from low to high, the carry affects the higher bits.

The XOR condition for each bit is known. For the current bit, we need to select how many elements have this bit set. The count must be congruent to z's bit modulo 2. Let's denote the current bit as k. Then, the number of elements with the k-th bit set is c, which must be c ≡ (z's k-th bit) mod 2. Also, the sum of the bits multiplied by 2^k plus the carry from the lower bits contributes to the total sum.

But how does the carry work here? Let's model the bits of the sum S. When processing bit k, the sum's bits up to k must not exceed s's bits up to k, considering the carry.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can model the DP state as (current bit, carry, tight). The 'tight' represents whether the bits processed so far are exactly equal to the upper limit's bits, or if they are less (so we have more flexibility in higher bits). But given that s can be up to 1e18, this might be feasible.

Alternatively, here's another approach inspired by some digit DP techniques:

We need to model two constraints:

1. The sum of all elements must be <= s.
2. The XOR of all elements is z.

We can model this using a DP that processes each bit from the lowest to the highest. For each bit, we track the number of elements that have this bit set (with parity determined by z's bit) and the carry generated from the previous bits.

But how to model the carry?

Each element's bits contribute to the sum. Let's look at the sum S. The sum can be written as the sum over each bit k of (number of elements with bit k set) * 2^k, plus possible carry-over. Wait, no. Wait, when adding the bits, the sum at each position is the sum of the bits in that position across all elements, plus the carry from the previous position. Then, the current bit of the sum is (sum + carry_in) mod 2, and the carry_out is (sum + carry_in) // 2. So for each bit position k, the sum's contribution to the total sum is (sum_k + carry_in) * 2^k.

But in our case, the total sum S must be <= s. So during the DP, we need to track how the bits of S are being built, ensuring that they don't exceed the corresponding bits of s.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the DP state as follows:

- We process each bit starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
- For each bit k, we need to decide how many elements have their k-th bit set. This number must have the same parity as the k-th bit of z (since XOR is z).
- The sum of the bits at position k (sum_k) contributes to the total sum. However, sum_k multiplied by 2^k plus the carry from the lower bits (carry_in) contributes to the sum up to this bit.
- The carry_out is (sum_k + carry_in) // 2, which affects the higher bits.

So the DP state can be represented by the current bit position k, the current carry, and whether we are still tight (i.e., the bits processed so far match exactly the upper limit s's bits up to this position). The tight condition ensures that we can't choose a higher bit than s's in the current position if we've been tight so far.

The transitions would involve choosing how many elements have the k-th bit set (c), which must satisfy c ≡ z_k (mod 2), and then computing the new carry and tight condition.

The base case is when all bits are processed (k exceeds the maximum bit in s). Then, the carry must be zero, otherwise the sum would exceed s.

Wait, but the carry after processing all bits can't be non-zero. Because the sum S must be <= s. So the carry after processing the highest bit must be zero.

Hmm, but how high do we need to process the bits? Since s can be up to 1e18, which is about 60 bits. So processing up to 60 bits should suffice.

So here's the plan for the DP:

The state is (bit, carry, tight). For each state, we iterate over possible choices for the number of elements c that have the current bit set. c must be between 0 and n, and must have the same parity as the current bit in z. Then, compute the new carry and whether the next state is tight.

The DP transitions would then proceed as follows:

For each state (k, carry_in, tight), for each possible c (number of elements with bit k set) where c is even or odd according to z's k-th bit:

sum_k = c (since each element contributes 1 to the sum of the current bit if the bit is set)
current_sum_at_bit = sum_k + carry_in

current_bit_value_in_s = (s >> k) & 1 if tight else 0 (since if not tight, we can choose 0 or 1 freely)

The bits of the sum S up to bit k can be considered. The current_sum_at_bit is sum_k + carry_in. When divided by 2, the carry_out is (current_sum_at_bit) // 2, and the bit of the sum is (current_sum_at_bit) % 2.

But how does this affect the tightness?

The sum's bits up to k must be <= s's bits up to k. So when building the sum, after processing bit k, the sum up to k must not exceed the s up to k.

But how to model this? Let's think recursively.

If we are in a tight state up to bit k-1, then for bit k, the sum's bit (current_sum_at_bit % 2) must be <= the bit of s at k. If it's less, then in the next state, tight is False. If equal, tight remains True. Otherwise, it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps the tightness is determined by whether the bits processed so far are equal to the upper limit's bits. So, for each bit, we track whether the bits chosen so far are exactly equal to s's bits. When tight is True, any choice for the current bit must not exceed s's bit at this position. If the chosen bit is less than s's, then tight becomes False for the next bits. If it's equal, tight remains True.

But how does the current_sum_at_bit affect the sum's bit?

The sum's bit at position k is (current_sum_at_bit) % 2, and the carry_out is (current_sum_at_bit) // 2.

So the sum's bit up to position k is (sum_0, sum_1, ..., sum_k), where sum_i is (sum of the elements' bits at i plus carry_in from i-1) mod 2. But the actual sum S is the sum over sum_i * 2^i, which is equivalent to the binary representation of S.

But to compare S with s, the binary digits must form a number that is less than or equal to s.

So the DP needs to track the carry, and the tightness (whether the bits chosen so far are exactly the same as s's bits up to k). The carry is the amount carried over to the next higher bit.

Wait, perhaps the DP state is (k, carry, tight), and the transitions are:

For each possible c (number of elements with the k-th bit set) that is congruent to z's k-th bit mod 2:

sum_k = c (each element contributes 1 to the sum of the k-th bit)

current_total = sum_k + carry_in

bit_sum = current_total % 2

new_carry = current_total // 2

Now, the next state's carry is new_carry.

For tightness:

If tight is True, then the bit_sum must be <= s's k-th bit. If bit_sum is less than s's bit, then the next tight is False. If equal, next tight is True. If greater, then this path is invalid.

Wait, no. Because the sum's bits are determined by the elements and the carry_in. So the sum's bits up to k are built step by step. However, the tightness represents whether the sum's bits up to k-1 are exactly equal to s's bits up to k-1. Then, for bit k:

If tight is True, the sum's bit at k must be <= s's bit at k. If the sum's bit is less than s's, then the next tight is False. If equal, next tight is True. If sum's bit is greater, then this path is invalid.

But how do we compute the sum's bit here? Because the sum's bit is (sum_k + carry_in) % 2. So the sum's bits up to k can be thought of as the binary digits of the sum S.

So the DP state must track the carry and whether the sum's bits up to the current position are less than or equal to s's bits, considering the carry.

Alternatively, perhaps the tightness is tracked as a boolean, and when tight is True, the current bits must not exceed s's bits. So for each state (k, carry, tight), we can transition to the next state (k+1, new_carry, new_tight), based on the sum of the current bit and carry_in.

But how does the carry affect the sum's bits? Let's consider that the sum up to bit k is S_k = sum_{i=0}^k (bit_i) * 2^i. The sum is equal to the sum of all elements plus the carry from previous bits. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

An alternative approach is to model the sum S as the sum of all elements. We need S <= s. But since the sum S is the sum of the elements, and their XOR is z, we can model the problem as follows:

The sum S is equal to the XOR z plus twice the sum of the pairwise carry terms. Wait, I recall that the sum and XOR are related by S = X + 2B, where B is the sum of the carries when adding the bits. So perhaps, for the sum S, since X is fixed as z, the sum S must be z + 2B. Therefore, for the sum S to be >= l and <= r, it must satisfy that (S - z) is even and B = (S - z)/2.

But how does this help? Because the sum S must be >= l and <= r. So S must be in [l, r], and S must be >= z, and S - z must be even. Because if S = z + 2B, then S - z must be even, so B is an integer.

So first, the sum S can be written as z + 2B, where B is a non-negative integer. Then, the sum must satisfy l <= z + 2B <= r. So B must be in [ (l - z + 1)/2 , (r - z)/2 ] if z <= r. Otherwise, there are no solutions.

Wait, but this is only possible when S >= z. Because S is z + 2B, and B is non-negative. So if l > z + 2B_max possible, then no solution. So the first step is to check whether z > r. If z is greater than r, then the sum S (which is at least z) would exceed r, so there are zero arrays.

Otherwise, the sum S must be between max(l, z) and r, and S must have the same parity as z (since S = z + 2B). So the valid S's are those in [max(l, z), r] with S ≡ z mod 2.

But how do we count the number of arrays with sum S and XOR z for each such S?

But even this seems difficult. So perhaps the DP approach is the way to go.

Let's try to model the DP again. The key idea is to process each bit from LSB to MSB, tracking the carry and whether we are tight with the upper bound s.

The DP state is (bit, carry, tight). The transition depends on choosing the number of elements that have the current bit set (c), which must have parity matching z's current bit. Then, the sum of the bits plus carry_in will give the current bit of the sum (mod 2) and the new carry (divided by 2).

Moreover, the tightness is determined by whether the sum's bits processed so far are less than or equal to the corresponding bits of s.

The DP recurrence can be built as follows:

At each bit position k, for each possible state (carry, tight):

- If tight is True, then the sum's bits up to k must not exceed s's bits up to k. So when processing bit k, the current bit of the sum (sum_bit) must be <= s's bit at k. If sum_bit < s's bit, then the tight becomes False for the next bits. If sum_bit == s's bit, the tight remains True. If sum_bit > s's bit, this state is invalid and contributes 0.

- For the current bit, the number of elements with the bit set (c) must satisfy c mod 2 == z_k (where z_k is the k-th bit of z).

- The sum of the current bits is c. The carry_in is added to this sum. So total = c + carry_in. The new carry is total // 2, and the current sum bit is total % 2.

- Then, we check if the current sum bit (sum_bit) is allowed based on the tight condition. For example, if tight is True, sum_bit must be <= s's bit at k. If sum_bit is greater than s's bit, then this choice is invalid and contributes nothing. Otherwise, the new tight condition is (sum_bit == s's bit at k) and previous tight was True.

So the steps for each state and each possible c are:

1. Check that c is between 0 and n, inclusive, and that c mod 2 == z's k-th bit.

2. Compute total = c + carry_in. sum_bit = total % 2. new_carry = total // 2.

3. If tight is True, check if sum_bit <= s_k (the k-th bit of s). If sum_bit > s_k, skip this c.

4. Compute the new_tight condition: if tight was True and sum_bit == s_k, then new_tight is True. Else, new_tight is False.

5. Add the number of ways to choose c elements (C(n, c)) multiplied by the DP value of the next state (k+1, new_carry, new_tight) to the current state's value.

The base case is when all bits have been processed (k exceeds the maximum bit in s). Then, the carry must be zero, otherwise the sum would have a carry beyond the maximum bit, which would make it exceed s.

So the DP transitions are manageable, but the state space needs to be manageable.

But what's the maximum possible carry? For each bit, the maximum carry_in is (n * 1) + carry_in_prev. For example, for bit k, the sum of c (which can be up to n) plus carry_in_prev (which could be up to (n + carry_in_prev_prev)/2). But since each step the carry is divided by 2, the maximum possible carry is O(n) per bit. But with 60 bits, and n up to 1000, the carry can be up to (n + (n + ... )/2 )... which seems to be O(n * 2^60), which is way too big.

Wait, but the sum of the elements' bits at position k can be up to n (each element has the bit set or not). The carry_in is the carry from the previous bit. Let's think: when processing bit k, the carry_in can be up to (sum_{k-1} + carry_in_prev). But since sum_{k-1} is the number of elements with the (k-1)-th bit set, which is at most n. The previous carry_in_prev could be up to (sum_{k-2} + carry_in_prev_prev) / 2, and so on. So the maximum possible carry_in for bit k is (n + carry_in_prev) // 2. But after several bits, the carry_in would be bounded by something like O(n). Because each time you divide by 2. For example, if carry_in_prev is up to (n + carry_in_prev_prev) // 2. For the first few bits, it's possible to have carry_in up to (n + (n + ... ))/2. But over 60 bits, this would be O(n * 2^0) for each bit, which is n. So maybe the maximum possible carry_in is O(n).

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible carry_in after processing k bits is n. Because the sum of the bits up to k is S = sum_{i=0}^k (c_i * 2^i), where c_i is the number of elements with bit i set. Then, the sum S is <= sum_{i=0}^k (n * 2^i) ) = n*(2^{k+1} -1). But when processing each bit, the carry_in for bit k is (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c_i * 2^i) ) // 2^k. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the maximum possible carry_in when processing bit k is n*(2^{k} -1) / 2^{k} ), but that's probably not helpful.

Alternatively, for each bit, the carry_in can be up to (n + carry_in_prev) / 2. Starting from carry_in_0 = 0, the maximum possible carry_in after processing bit 0 would be (n + 0) / 2 = n//2. Then, for bit 1, the carry_in is (n + carry_in_prev) // 2. Which would be (n + n//2)/2 = (3n/2)/2 = 3n/4. For bit 2, it's (n + 3n/4)/2 = 7n/8. Continuing this, the maximum carry_in for bit k is ( (2^{k+1} -1) *n ) / 2^{k+1} ). For large k, this approaches n. So for 60 bits, the carry_in can be up to n. So the carry can be up to n, which for n=1e3 is manageable.

So the possible carry_in values are up to 1e3, and the bit positions are up to 60, and tight is a boolean. So the DP state is (bit, carry, tight). The number of possible states is 60 * 1e3 * 2 = 1.2e5, which is acceptable.

So the DP approach is feasible.

Now, the steps for the solution:

1. For a given upper bound s (like r or l-1), compute the number of arrays that have sum <= s and XOR z.

2. The answer is (compute(r) - compute(l-1)) mod MOD.

So the code needs to implement this compute(s) function.

Now, to implement compute(s):

- First, check if z > s. Then, there are zero arrays.

- Else, proceed with the DP.

The DP for compute(s):

We'll process each bit from 0 to 60 (assuming 60 bits is sufficient for s).

We'll use memoization to store the DP states. But for Python, using a memoization decorator may be too slow for 1e5 states. So we can use a bottom-up DP approach with a 2D array for each bit and carry, and track the tight condition.

But for Python, even with 1e5 states, it's manageable.

The key steps for the DP:

Initialize the DP table. For each state (k, carry, tight), we store the number of ways.

The initial state is (0, 0, True) with 1 way.

Wait, wait. Wait, the first bit is the 0-th bit (LSB). The initial carry before processing any bits is zero. And we start in the tight condition (since we haven't chosen any bits yet, and the sum is zero, which is equal to s's bits up to that point (none), so tight is True).

Wait, maybe the initial state is processing the first bit (k=0), with carry_in=0, and tight is True. So the initial state is (bit=0, carry=0, tight=True) and ways=1.

Wait, no. Wait, the DP starts at bit 0. Initially, the carry_in is zero, and tight is True. So for each bit, we process the bits of the sum and track the carry and tightness.

So for each state (k, carry, tight), we can transition to the next state (k+1, new_carry, new_tight) based on the number of elements with the k-th bit set (c).

The transitions:

For each possible c (even or odd as per z's bit k):

If c is even and z's bit k is 1, then skip. So c must be even if z's bit is 0, or odd if z's bit is 1.

Wait, no. The parity of c must match the bit in z. For each bit k, the parity of c (number of elements with bit k set) must be equal to z's k-th bit.

So c % 2 == (z >> k) & 1.

So for each c in 0..n where c%2 == (z >>k) &1.

Then, sum_k = c. The current_total = sum_k + carry_in.

sum_bit = current_total % 2

new_carry = current_total // 2

Now, check if tight is True. If so, then the sum_bit must be <= (s >>k) &1.

If sum_bit > (s's k-th bit), then this c is invalid.

Else, new_tight is tight and (sum_bit == (s's k-th bit)).

So for tight, the new_tight is (tight) and (sum_bit == s's bit at k).

Wait, no. If tight is True, then the sum's bits processed so far (up to bit k-1) are exactly equal to s's bits up to k-1. For bit k, if sum_bit (the sum's bit at k) is less than s's bit at k, then the new_tight is False. If sum_bit is equal, new_tight remains True. If sum_bit is greater, then it's invalid.

So the new_tight is (tight) and (sum_bit == (s >>k) &1).

So the steps are:

For each state (k, carry_in, tight):

   for c in 0 to n where c % 2 == (z's k-th bit):

       sum_k = c

       current_total = sum_k + carry_in

       sum_bit = current_total % 2

       new_carry = current_total // 2

       if tight:

           s_bit = (s >> k) & 1

           if sum_bit > s_bit:

               continue

           new_tight = (sum_bit == s_bit) and tight

       else:

           new_tight = False

       if k+1 > max_bit and new_carry != 0:

           continue  # carry after last bit is invalid

       add the number of ways to (k+1, new_carry, new_tight) by multiplying the current ways by C(n, c)

But wait, the max_bit is the highest bit in s. But since s can be up to 1e18, which is 60 bits. So we need to process up to 60 bits.

But after processing all 60 bits, the carry must be zero. Because the sum S is <= s, which is up to 60 bits, and any carry beyond that would make S exceed s. So after processing all bits (say, up to 60), the carry must be zero.

So the base case is when k exceeds 60, then check if carry is zero. But during the DP, when k reaches 60, we need to process that bit and ensure that the carry is zero.

Wait, perhaps the processing goes up to bit 60. Let's assume that s can have up to 60 bits. So we process all bits from 0 to 60. After processing bit 60, the carry must be zero.

So for the DP, after processing all bits (k=60), the new_carry must be zero. Otherwise, those states are invalid.

So the DP transitions will proceed until k=60, and then check if the carry is zero.

So the code will need to process bits from 0 to 60 inclusive. Then, after processing bit 60, the carry must be zero.

So here's the plan for the DP:

Initialize the DP table. The initial state is (k=0, carry=0, tight=True) with 1 way.

For each bit from 0 to 60:

   For each possible carry_in:

       For each tight (True or False):

           For each possible c (number of elements with current bit set) that satisfies c%2 == z's current bit:

               Compute sum_bit and new_carry as before.

               Check if tight is True: if sum_bit > s's current bit, skip.

               Compute new_tight.

               Compute the next bit (k+1).

               If k+1 is 61 (after processing all bits):

                   if new_carry != 0: skip.

                   else: add C(n,c) * current ways to the total.

               else:

                   add to the next state (k+1, new_carry, new_tight) the product of current ways and C(n,c).

But this approach may need to precompute all combinations C(n, c) for all c up to n. Since n can be up to 1000, precomputing a combination table is feasible.

So precompute C(n, c) for all 0 <= c <= n. This can be done with a combination function, but since n is up to 1000, precomputing a 2D array (for all n up to 1000 and c up to n) is possible.

Wait, but for the current problem, n is fixed for each test case. So for each test case, when we call compute(s), we can precompute comb = [C(n, c) for c in 0..n]. But since the compute function is called twice per test case (once for r, once for l-1), it's better to precompute comb once per test case.

So steps for the code:

For each test case:

   Read n, l, r, z.

   Compute comb = [combinations(n, c) for c in 0..n]. But how to compute combinations?

Wait, the number of ways to choose c elements to set the current bit is comb(n, c). Because each of the n elements can have 0 or 1 in the current bit. So the count is the number of ways to choose exactly c elements to have their bit set. So this is C(n, c).

So for each c in 0..n, the count is C(n, c).

But n can be up to 1000, and for each test case, we need to compute these combinations modulo MOD. So precomputing these values once per test case is feasible.

So for each test case, precompute comb = [C(n, c) mod MOD for c in 0..n].

To compute these combinations, since n is up to 1000, we can use a dynamic programming approach.

For example, comb[0] = 1 (only 0 elements chosen), and then for each i from 1 to n:

   comb[i] = comb[i-1] * (n - i + 1) // i.

But division modulo MOD is handled using modular inverses. So for Python, we can precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 1000, then compute C(n, c) as fact[n] * inv_fact[c] * inv_fact[n - c] mod MOD.

Yes, that's more efficient.

So precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 1e3 once, then for each test case, compute the combinations using those.

But since n is up to 1000, and 1e3 is small, precomputing up to 1e3 is manageable.

So code steps:

Precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

For each test case:

   Read n, l, r, z.

   precompute comb = [C(n, c) mod MOD for c in 0..n]

   Then compute compute(r) and compute(l-1)

   The answer is (compute(r) - compute(l-1)) mod MOD.

   Output the answer.

But what about z being larger than s in compute(s)? Then, the result is zero.

Now, the compute(s) function:

def compute(s):

   if z > s:

       return 0

   max_bit = s.bit_length() if s else 0

   # process up to 60 bits

   # create DP table

   # initialize DP[0][0][True] = 1

   # for each bit from 0 to 60:

   #   for each carry_in:

   #       for tight in [True, False]:

   #           for c in 0..n where c % 2 == z_bit:

   #               compute sum_bit and new_carry

   #               check tight conditions

   #               update next state

   MOD = 10**9 +7

   # precompute the bits of s for all positions up to 60

   s_bits = [ (s >> k) & 1 for k in range(61) ]

   # z_bits = [ (z >> k) & 1 for k in range(61) ]

   # precompute z's bits for all positions up to 60

   # Initialize DP

   dp = [ [ [0]*2 for _ in range(1001) ] for __ in range(62) ]

   # dp[k][carry][tight] = number of ways

   # Initial state: at bit 0, carry 0, tight=True

   dp[0][0][1] = 1  # tight is 1 for True, 0 for False

   for k in range(61):

       for carry in range(1001):

           for tight in [0, 1]:

               current_ways = dp[k][carry][tight]

               if current_ways == 0:

                   continue

               z_bit = (z >> k) & 1

               # iterate over possible c in 0..n where c %2 == z_bit

               for c in range(0, n+1):

                   if (c % 2) != z_bit:

                   current_total = c + carry

                   sum_bit = current_total % 2

                   new_carry = current_total // 2

                       # but carry is zero, and no more bits to process

                       # so multiply current_ways * comb[c] and add to the result

                       res = (current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

                       # accumulate this to the answer

                       # but how? maybe track a separate answer variable.

                       # Wait, the code for the DP is not handling this correctly. Because after processing all bits, we need to check if new_carry is zero.

                       # So for k=60, after processing, if new_carry is zero, then it's a valid solution.

                       # So when k reaches 60, the next step is k+1=61. So in the code, after processing k=60, we can collect the valid states where carry is zero.

                   else:

                       # so we need to check if new_carry is within 0..1000. Otherwise, skip.

                       if new_carry > 1000:

                           continue

                   if k+1 == 61:

                       ans = (ans + current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

                   else:

                       dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] = (dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] + current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

   # after processing all bits, collect the ways where carry is zero and tight is any.

   # but the code above already accumulates the answer when k+1=61.

   # Wait, perhaps after processing all bits, the carry must be zero.

   # So after processing k=60, the next state is k+1=61. For those states, we need to check new_carry == 0.

   # So the code for k=60's transitions to k+1=61 must check if new_carry is zero.

   # So the code for when k+1=61 must accumulate the current_ways * comb[c] into the answer, but only if new_carry is zero.

   # So in the code, for each transition to k+1=61, check if new_carry is zero. If yes, add to the answer.

   # So perhaps the DP table is not the way to go. Instead, during the transitions, when k+1=61, check new_carry and accumulate the answer.

   # So the code needs to track a separate answer variable.

   # So in the code, during each step, when processing k=60, and after computing new_carry, if k+1=61 and new_carry is zero, then multiply by comb[c] and add to the answer.

   # So the code can have a variable 'ans' that accumulates all such valid cases.

   # So the initial 'ans' is zero.

   ans = 0

   # Then, during the processing of each state, when k+1=61 and new_carry is zero, add to ans.

   # So in the code:

   # ...

   # in the loop for each k:

   # ...

   # when processing a transition that leads to k+1=61:

   if k+1 == 61:

       if new_carry !=0:

           continue

       ans = (ans + current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

   else:

       # update the next state's DP

       if new_carry <= 1000:

           dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] += current_ways * comb[c]

           dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] %= MOD

   # ...

   # After processing all bits, return ans.

   return ans

But this requires modifying the code to track 'ans' separately. So the DP code must accumulate the answer when processing the 61st bit (i.e., after all bits are processed) and new_carry is zero.

So the code for compute(s) is:

def compute(s):

   if z > s:

       return 0

   MOD = 10**9 +7

   s_bits = [ (s >> k) &1 for k in range(61) ]

   comb = precompute_comb(n)  # comb[c] is C(n,c) mod MOD

   # Initialize DP table. For each step, we need to track (k, carry, tight).

   # Since k can be up to 60, carry up to 1000, tight is 0 or 1.

   # So using a 3-dimensional array: dp[k][carry][tight]

   # But in Python, using a dictionary or list of lists may be more efficient.

   # But for speed, perhaps use a list of lists.

   # But with 61 bits, 1001 carry, and 2 tight states, the total size is 61 * 1001 * 2 = 122,122 entries.

   # So manageable.

   # Initialize DP.

   dp = [ [ [0]*2 for _ in range(1001) ] for __ in range(61) ]

   # dp[k][carry][tight] = number of ways

   # Start at k=0, carry=0, tight=1 (True)

   dp[0][0][1] = 1

   ans = 0

   for k in range(61):

       for carry in range(1001):

           for tight in [0, 1]:

               current_ways = dp[k][carry][tight]

               if current_ways == 0:

                   continue

               for c in range(0, n+1):

                   if (c %2) != z_bit:

                       continue

                   sum_bit = current_total %2

                   if tight:

                       # sum_bit must <= s_bit.

                       s_bit = s_bits[k] if k < len(s_bits) else 0

                       if sum_bit > s_bit:

                           continue

                       new_tight_flag = 1 if (sum_bit == s_bit) else 0

                   else:

                       new_tight_flag = 0

                   # Check if this is the last bit (k=60, next is 61).

                   if k == 60:

                       # After processing all bits, new_carry must be zero.

                       if new_carry !=0:

                           continue

                       # Add to answer.

                       ans = (ans + current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

                   else:

                       # Proceed to next bit.

                       new_tight = new_tight_flag

                       if new_carry > 1000:

                           # Carry exceeds limit, can't process.

                           continue

                       # Update next state.

                       dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] = (dp[k+1][new_carry][new_tight] + current_ways * comb[c]) % MOD

   return ans

But wait, in the code above, the 'k' loop runs from 0 to 60 (inclusive). For each k, the code processes transitions to k+1. When k is 60, the next is 61, which is not processed (since the loop runs up to 60). But in the code, during the processing of k=60, the code checks if k is 60, and adds to the ans.

So this should cover all transitions.

But the code has to precompute comb for each c. Also, the precompute_comb function must return a list where comb[c] is C(n, c) mod MOD.

Now, precomputing comb for a given n:

To compute comb = [C(n, c) mod MOD], for c in 0..n.

This can be done using the factorial approach:

precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

fact = [1]*(n_max +1)

for i in 1 to n_max:

   fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(n_max +1)

inv_fact[n_max] = pow(fact[n_max], MOD-2, MOD)

for i in n_max-1 downto 0:

   inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

Then, C(n, c) = fact[n] * inv_fact[c] * inv_fact[n -c] % MOD

But for each test case, n can vary, but up to 1e3. So precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

Wait, but in Python, the code can precompute fact and inv_fact once up to 1e3.

So precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3 outside of the test cases.

For example:

MOD = 10**9 +7

max_n = 1000

fact = [1]*(max_n+1)

for i in range(1, max_n+1):

   fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(max_n+1)

inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)

for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):

   inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

def comb(n, c):

   if c <0 or c >n:

       return 0

   return fact[n] * inv_fact[c] % MOD * inv_fact[n - c] % MOD

Then, for each test case:

   n = ... 

   precompute comb = [comb(n, c) for c in range(n+1)]

But since comb(n, c) is precomputed for all n up to 1e3 and c up to n, this is feasible.

So, putting it all together:

The code structure is:

precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

Read n, l, r, z.

precompute comb = [comb(n, c) for c in 0..n]

compute_upper = compute(r)

compute_lower = compute(l-1)

answer = (compute_upper - compute_lower) % MOD

print(answer)

Now, implement the compute function as described.

But there's a problem: when s is large (like 1e18), the s_bits list will be of length 61. For bits beyond the length of s, the s_bits[k] is 0.

For example, if s is 0, then all bits are 0. So s_bits is [0]*61.

So in the code, s_bits is computed as [ (s >> k) &1 for k in range(61) ].

Now, the code for compute(s):

But the code may have some issues, like when s is zero. Need to test.

Let's test the first sample input:

Sample 1:

3 1 5 1

So n=3, l=1, r=5, z=1.

compute(r=5):

s=5, bits are 101 (LSB first, but processed from 0 to 60).

But the code uses s_bits[k] = (s >>k) &1. For k=0, it's 1, k=1 0, k=2 1, others 0.

So during the DP processing, when k=0, tight is True, etc.

The code should count the 13 arrays mentioned.

But how to verify?

But given the time constraints, perhaps proceed.

Another thing: the code uses 's_bits' for each k up to 60. So even if s has a higher bit, it's zero.

Now, the code for compute(s) should handle all possible s up to 1e18.

Another edge case: when s is zero. Then, only arrays with sum zero and XOR zero are valid.

But according to the problem statement, z can be up to 1e18. So if s is zero and z is not zero, there are no arrays.

But the code's compute(s) function checks if z > s, returns zero. So if s is zero and z is zero, then compute returns the number of arrays with sum zero and XOR zero. Which is 1 if n=0 (but n >=1 as per constraints). For n=1, sum zero and XOR zero implies a_1=0. So one array.

But the code will process that.

Now, let's think about the code's efficiency. For each test case, the compute function runs 61 bits, each with up to 1001 carry and 2 tight states. For each state, looping through up to 1000 possible c values. So per test case, the time is O(61 * 1001 * 2 * 1000) = about 1e8 operations. But Python is slow for 1e8 operations. Wait, but 61 * 1001 * 2 is about 122,000 states per bit, and for each state, up to 1000 c values. So 122,000 * 1000 = 122,000,000 per bit. For 61 bits, that's 7.4e9 operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second.

But the actual code may be optimized. Wait, no. The code as written would be way too slow. For example, for each of the 61 bits, and for each carry (up to 1e3), tight (2), and c (up to 1e3), this would be 61 * 1e3 * 2 * 1e3 = 122 million operations, which would take way longer than the 2 seconds time limit.

So the code as described is not feasible for Python. We need to find a way to optimize this.

Hmm, perhaps the number of valid c's for each bit is roughly n/2. For each bit, c must have a certain parity, so for each c, it's either even or odd. For example, if the required parity is even, then c can be 0,2,4,... up to n (if n is even) or n-1 (if n is odd). So the number of possible c's is roughly (n+1)/2.

But n can be up to 1000, so that's 500 c's per bit. Still, 61 * 1e3 * 2 * 500 = 61 million operations per compute function. For two compute functions per test case, that's 122 million operations. Python would take around 1 second for that, but maybe not.

But even that, maybe it's possible to optimize.

Alternative approach: precompute for each possible parity the list of possible c's and their comb values.

For each bit k, the required parity is (z >>k) &1. So for each bit, the possible c's are all c in 0..n with c%2 == parity.

So for each bit, precompute a list of c's and their comb values. For example, for even c's, collect all even c's and sum their comb values.

Wait, but the comb values are multiplied by the current_ways. So perhaps precompute for each parity the sum of comb[c] for c with parity p.

But no, because for each c, the code has to multiply by comb[c] and add to the next state. So precomputing the sum isn't helpful.

But if the code can iterate through all valid c's quickly.

Alternative optimization: precompute for each parity (0 or 1) a list of c's in 0..n that have that parity, along with comb[c]. So for each parity, we have a list of (c, comb[c]).

Then, for each bit, we can loop through the list for the required parity.

This reduces the number of c's considered per bit by half. For n=1000, this would be 500 c's per bit.

But it's still 500 iterations per state.

Another optimization: note that the comb[c] can be precomputed for all possible c's, and for each parity, store the list of (c, comb[c]).

But this is already done.

Another possible optimization is to use bitmasking and bit operations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can optimize the code to avoid redundant checks.

But even with these optimizations, the code may be too slow for Python. So what's the alternative?

Alternative approach: note that the sum S must be >= z and even. But the code for compute(s) can be optimized by considering the bits in a different way.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps we can find a mathematical formula for the number of valid arrays.

Alternatively, we can model the problem using generating functions.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the DP approach is the way to go, but with some optimizations.

Possible optimizations:

1. Precompute the list of c's for each parity once per test case, and then for each bit, iterate through the precomputed list.

This reduces the number of iterations per state.

For example, for each test case:

   even_c = [c for c in 0..n if c%2 ==0]

   odd_c = [c for c in 0..n if c%2 ==1]

   for each bit k:

       required_parity = (z >>k) &1

       if required_parity == 0:

           c_list = even_c

       else:

           c_list = odd_c

       for c in c_list:

           ... 

This way, for each bit, we only iterate over c's of the required parity, reducing the number of iterations.

But even this may not be enough for Python to handle the 61*1e3*2*500 iterations.

Another optimization is to precompute for each parity the list of c's and their comb[c], and store them as tuples (c, comb_c). This would save accessing comb[c] each time.

But how much time does this save? Not sure.

Alternatively, in Python, using for loops is slow. To speed this up, perhaps use numpy or other vectorized operations. But this is not allowed, as the code must use standard input and output.

Another approach is to use memoization with bitmasking, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, note that the carry_in can be up to 1000, but for each bit, the carry_in is new_carry = (c + carry_in_prev) // 2. Since c can be up to n=1000, and carry_in_prev up to 1000, new_carry can be up to (1000 + 1000)/2 = 1000.

So the carry_in can be up to 1000.

Thus, the code's upper limit for carry is sufficient.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can be accepted if it's optimized properly.

Another optimization is to use a list for the DP and reuse it for each bit, rather than using a 3D list. For example, use two layers: current and next.

For each bit k, we have current_dp (carry, tight) and next_dp (carry, tight).

This reduces memory usage and may speed up the code.

For example:

current_dp is a dictionary or 2D array that holds the number of ways for (carry, tight) at bit k.

Then, for each bit k, we process current_dp and build next_dp.

This way, the code can avoid using a 3D array, which may be faster in Python.

So the code for compute(s) can be rewritten as:

def compute(s):

   if z > s:

       return 0

   MOD = 10**9 +7

   # Precompute comb[c] for c in 0..n, as before.

   comb = [comb(n, c) for c in range(n+1)]

   # Precompute s_bits for 0..60.

   s_bits = [ (s >> k) &1 for k in range(61) ]

   # Initialize current_dp: carry and tight.

   # current_dp is a dictionary or 2D list: carry ranges from 0 to 1000, tight 0/1.

   current_dp = [ [0]*2 for _ in range(1001) ]

   current_dp[0][1] = 1  # initial state: carry 0, tight=True (1)

   ans = 0

   return ans

This way, the code uses two 2D arrays (current and next) per bit, which is more memory efficient and possibly faster.

Also, precompute the c_list for even and odd c's once per test case.

For example:

even_c = [c for c in range(n+1) if c%2 ==0]

odd_c = [c for c in range(n+1) if c%2 ==1]

c_list = [even_c, odd_c]

Then, for each bit k, use c_list[z_bit].

This way, the code only iterates over the relevant c's.

So, putting all these optimizations together:

Precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

For each test case:

   Read n, l, r, z.

   Precompute comb = [comb(n, c) for c in 0..n]

   Precompute even_c and odd_c lists.

   Compute compute(r) and compute(l-1).

   The answer is (compute(r) - compute(l-1)) mod MOD.

The code for compute(s) is as rewritten above.

With these optimizations, the code may run within the time limit.

Testing this code against the sample inputs:

Sample 1:

3 1 5 1

compute(r=5) should return 13.

compute(l-1=0) returns 0.

So answer is 13.

Sample 2:

4 1 3 2

compute(r=3) gives the arrays with sum <=3 and XOR 2.

The sample output is 4.

compute(l-1=0) returns 0.

Thus, the answer is 4.

The code should handle these cases.

But in practice, the code may have bugs.

For example, the way tight is computed. For example, tight is a boolean that becomes False once a bit is chosen that is less than the corresponding bit in s.

But in the code, new_tight is 1 if sum_bit == s_bit and tight was 1. Else, new_tight is 0.

Yes.

Another potential bug is the handling of s_bits. For k >= len(s_bits), s_bits[k] is 0. But in the code, s_bits is precomputed as 61 elements, so k < 61 is always true.

Yes.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, the final code:

Precompute fact and inv_fact up to 1e3.

Then, for each test case:

Read n, l, r, z.

Precompute comb for n.

Precompute even and odd c lists.

Implement compute(s) using the optimized DP approach.

Finally, output (compute(r) - compute(l-1)) mod MOD.

But in Python, the code can be written as follows.
