<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to format some text lines into a centered alignment surrounded by a frame of asterisks. Hmm. Let's read the problem carefully.

First, the input is multiple lines. Each line can't start or end with spaces, but can have spaces in between. The output should be a framed block where each line is centered. The frame is made of '*' and should be the minimal possible size. Oh right, and when centering isn't perfect (like the line's length is even but the frame's width is odd, or vice versa), we need to alternate between putting the extra space on the left and right, starting with left.

Wait, the problem says that when a line can't be perfectly centered, round down the distance to the left and right, and alternate which side gets the shorter space. Wait, the example shows that. For example, in the first sample input, the line "5" is length 1. The frame's width is 12 (since the surrounding stars are 12 in total, the actual width inside is 12-2 = 10. So the line of length 1 needs 9 spaces total. Divided by 2, which is 4.5. So rounded down, left is 4, right is 5. But since when you start with left, the first time it's left, then next right, etc. But maybe the order depends on the lines. Let's see the first example:

The lines are:
This  is (length 7)
Codeforces (10)
Beta (4)
Round (5)
5 (1)

The maximum line length in the input is 10 (Codeforces). The frame's width is 10 + 2 = 12, so each line is padded to 10 characters inside the frame. Let's see:

For the line "This  is" (7 characters), the total padding needed is 3. So 10-7=3. Divided by 2, but 3 is odd. So left is 1, right 2? Wait, wait the problem says if the line can't be aligned perfectly (like even line length and odd width, etc.), then alternate. Wait, in this case, the line's length is 7, and the frame's inner width is 10 (since the total width is 12). So 10-7=3. So 3 spaces to distribute. 3 is odd. So left and right would be 1 and 2, but since it's the first occurrence, we put the extra space on the left first? Or wait, when the line is placed in a certain way. Let me think: for each line, the available space is the maximum line length (the width of the frame minus 2). So for each line, we calculate how much padding is needed on the left and right.

So the steps are:

1. Find the maximum line length in the input lines. Let's call this max_len. The frame's inner width is max_len. So the total width of the frame is max_len + 2 (each side *1* asterisk). The height is the number of lines + 2 (top and bottom borders).

2. For each line in the input, we need to add left and right padding so that the total length is max_len. But when the total padding (max_len - line_length) is even, then split equally. If it's odd, then alternate between left and right, starting with the left for the first occurrence.

Wait, but the problem says that in such cases (when the line can't be perfectly centered), the lines should be placed such that they are closer left or right alternately. So for lines that have padding that can't be split equally, the first such line has more padding on the left (since we round down the left distance?), then next one alternates.

Wait the problem statement says: "rounding down the distance to the left or to the right edge and bringing them closer left or right alternatively (you should start with bringing left)".

Wait, perhaps the idea is: the total padding needed is (max_len - line_length). So for each line, the left padding is (total_padding) // 2, and right padding is (total_padding +1) //2 if it's odd, but alternated.

Wait, let me think. Suppose total_padding is 3. Then 3 divided by 2 is 1.5. So when it's odd, sometimes we have left padding 1 and right 2, other times left 2 and right 1. The problem says to start with bringing the line closer to the left. Wait, no. The description says that if the line can't be perfectly aligned, the lines are placed closer left or right alternately, starting with left. So the first line that has an odd padding would be left-aligned (with left padding being (total_padding-1)/2, right padding (total_padding+1)/2?), no, wait.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is: for each line, the left padding is (total_padding - shift) // 2, and the right padding is (total_padding + shift) // 2, where shift is 0 if even, else alternated between 0 and 1. Or perhaps shift alternates between 0 and 1 for each line that has an odd padding.

Alternatively, let's consider that for lines with an odd total_padding (max_len - line_length is odd), the left and right padding will differ by 1. So for each such line, we need to decide whether left is (total_padding-1)/2 and right (total_padding+1)/2, or the other way around. The problem states that we start with bringing the line closer to the left first. Wait, the problem says: "you should start with bringing left or right alternatively (you should start with bringing left)". So the first time a line has an odd padding, left is rounded down (so left padding is (total_padding) // 2, since (total_padding) is odd, so (total_padding) // 2 is (total_padding -1)/2, and right padding is (total_padding +1)/2). Then next line with odd padding would do the opposite: left padding (total_padding+1)/2, right padding (total_padding-1)/2? Wait, that would make the line shift to the right. Hmm, but how?

Wait, for example, total_padding is 3 (max_len - line_length =3). So for the first line with this, left is 1, right 2. So the line is shifted left (since the left is smaller). The next line with odd padding would be shifted right (left padding is 2, right 1). So in that case, the line is shifted to the right.

So, the approach is:

- For each line, compute total_padding = max_len - len(line)
- If total_padding is even: left_pad = right_pad = total_padding//2
- If total_padding is odd: determine whether to add the extra space on the left or right. We alternate starting with left for the first occurrence.

So, the key is to track when we have a line with an odd padding, and alternate the side for each such line. So we need a flag that flips each time a line with an odd padding is encountered.

So steps to solve the problem:

1. Read all input lines. Since the input can have multiple lines, and each line can't start or end with spaces, but can contain spaces. So read all lines, stripping leading and trailing spaces? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the lines cannot start or end with a space. So each line is already trimmed. So we can read the lines as is.

2. Find the maximum line length, max_len, among all lines.

3. The frame's width is max_len + 2 (each side *). The top and bottom borders are asterisks of this width.

4. For each line in the input:

   a. Compute the total_padding = max_len - len(line)

   b. If total_padding is even: left and right are total_padding//2 each.

   c. Else: need to alternate the side. For the first such case, left_pad = total_padding // 2 (since total_padding is odd, 3//2=1, so left 1, right 2). Next such line, left_pad = (total_padding +1) //2, right_pad = (total_padding -1)//2.

   So, how to track the alternation? We can have a variable, like a boolean, that starts as False (indicating that the next odd padding should be left first). Then, each time we encounter an odd padding, we flip the boolean.

   So for each line:

   total_padding = max_len - len(line)

   if total_padding < 0: impossible, but according to problem statement, max_len is the maximum, so each line's length is <= max_len. So no, it's okay.

   Then:

   if total_padding % 2 == 0:
       left = right = total_padding//2
   else:
       if the alternation flag is False (start with left), then left = total_padding // 2 (since 3//2=1), right = total_padding - left (which is 2). Then, flip the flag to True for next time.
       else: left = (total_padding +1)//2 (since 3+1=4//2=2, right is 3-2=1), then flip the flag to False.

   So the first line with odd padding uses left padding as (total_padding//2), then the next line uses (total_padding+1)//2, and so on.

5. Then, each line is surrounded by '*' and the padding.

But how to handle the lines that have zero length? The problem states that at least one line has positive length. So some lines can be empty? Like, input could have a line that's empty string. But according to the input constraints, the lines cannot start or end with space. So empty lines are allowed.

Wait, the input lines can't start or end with space. But they can be empty. Because, for example, the input could have a line that is empty. But the problem says that at least one line has positive length.

But how? Well, the input is lines of the input, which can be empty. For example, the second sample input includes an empty line (the fifth line is empty, as per the sample output). Wait, looking at the second example:

Input:
welcome to the
Codeforces
Beta
Round 5
and
good luck

The output shows a line with "*              *" which is 14 characters inside, so the line is empty. So the input must have an empty line. So in the input, how is that possible? Because the problem says that each line cannot start or end with a space, but the line can be empty. So in that case, the input would have a line that's an empty string.

So when reading lines, we have to read them as they are, including empty ones.

So steps:

Read all lines from input. How to read them? Using input().split('\n')? Or read via sys.stdin.read().splitlines().

But in Python, if you read lines using input() in a loop, how do you stop? Because if you run input() and there's no more lines, it'll throw an EOFError. So perhaps the way to read all lines is:

lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in sys.stdin]

But in some cases, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() may be better. However, in programming competition settings, sometimes the input is read via multiple input() calls. But for code submission, the code must read all lines until EOF.

So in Python, the code can read all lines as:

import sys

lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in sys.stdin]

But note that sys.stdin includes all lines, including any trailing empty lines. But according to the problem statement, the input lines cannot start or end with space. But they can be empty. So in code, each line in lines is a string (possibly empty) that does not start or end with space.

Wait, the problem says "the lines cannot start or end with a space. It is guaranteed that at least one of the lines has positive length."

So each line in the input is either empty, or starts and ends with non-space.

So for example, a line with a single 'a' is allowed. A line with multiple spaces between letters is allowed, like 'a  b'.

So the code must read all lines, preserving the empty lines.

But how? Because when you read lines from sys.stdin, each line is read as a string, with the trailing newline. But using .rstrip('\n') would remove any trailing newline, but leaves the line's content as is, except the \n.

So for example, an empty line in the input would be read as an empty string.

So that's correct.

Once all lines are read, compute max_len as the maximum length of all lines.

Then, for each line, compute the left and right padding, considering the alternation for odd paddings.

Then, construct each formatted line as '*' followed by left padding (spaces), the line, right padding (spaces), followed by '*' and a newline.

Now, the steps for each line:

For a line with length l. The max_len is M.

total_padding = M - l.

If total_padding is 0: no padding.

Else, compute left and right padding.

But when total_padding is odd, we need to alternate.

So, for each line:

if total_padding is even: split equally.

Else:

if it's the first occurrence of odd padding, left pad is (total_padding-1)//2, right is (total_padding+1)//2.

Wait, no: total_padding is M - l, which is the sum of left and right. For example, if M - l is 3, then left can be 1, right 2 (sum 3). Or 2 and 1. So for the first occurrence, left is 1, right 2.

But how to track the alternation.

We can have a variable, shift, which starts as 0, and alternates between 0 and 1 for each odd padding line.

Wait, maybe for each line:

if total_padding is even: left = right = total_padding // 2.

else:

   if shift is 0:

       left = total_padding // 2   (e.g., 3//2=1)

       right = total_padding - left = 3-1=2

       shift = 1

   else:

       left = (total_padding +1) // 2   (3+1=4//2=2)

       right = total_padding - left = 1

       shift = 0

This way, each time we have an odd padding, the shift flips.

So, we need to track the shift state.

So in code:

shift = 0

for line in lines:

    l = len(line)

    total = max_len - l

    if total == 0:

        # no padding, add the line as is

        processed_line = '*' + line + '*'

    else:

        if total % 2 == 0:

            left = right = total // 2

        else:

            if shift == 0:

                left = total // 2

                right = total - left

                shift = 1

            else:

                left = (total + 1) // 2

                right = total - left

                shift = 0

        # create the line: '*' + left spaces + line + right spaces + '*'

        # but wait, line is in the middle, so it's left spaces + line + right spaces.

        # but the line is the original line, then left and right are the padding.

        processed_line = '*' + ' ' * left + line + ' ' * right + '*'

    add processed_line to the output.

Wait, no. The line is the original line, and we need to pad left and right with spaces to make the total length equal to max_len. So the structure is:

left_pad spaces + line + right_pad spaces.

But the sum of left_pad + len(line) + right_pad = max_len.

Yes.

So for example, line length is 7, max_len is 10. total_padding is 3. left_pad is 1, right_pad 2. So the line becomes ' ' *1 + line + ' ' *2. Then surrounded by *.

So the code for each line is:

left_pad = ... 

right_pad = ...

line_str = '*' + ' ' * left_pad + line + ' ' * right_pad + '*'

Now, after processing all lines, the top and bottom borders are '*' multiplied by (max_len + 2).

So the code steps:

Read all lines.

Compute max_len = max(len(line) for line in lines) if lines are not all empty. But since the problem states that at least one line has positive length, so max_len is at least 1.

Then, create the top and bottom borders: '*' * (max_len + 2).

Then, process each line as above, with the shift.

So code outline:

import sys

lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in sys.stdin]

max_len = max(len(line) for line in lines)

border = '*' * (max_len + 2)

result = [border]

shift = 0

for line in lines:

    l = len(line)

    total = max_len - l

    if total == 0:

        result.append('*' + line + '*')

    else:

        if total % 2 == 0:

            left = right = total // 2

        else:

            if shift == 0:

                left = total // 2

                right = total - left

                shift = 1

            else:

                left = (total + 1) // 2

                right = total - left

                shift = 0

        # construct the line

        padded_line = ' ' * left + line + ' ' * right

        result.append('*' + padded_line + '*')

result.append(border)

print('\n'.join(result))

Wait, but in the first sample input, the output is:

************

* This  is *

*          *

*Codeforces*

*   Beta   *

*  Round   *

*     5    *

************

Looking at the second line of the input (This is) which has length 7. The max_len is 10. So total_padding is 3. Since it's the first line with odd padding, shift is 0. So left is 3//2=1, right is 3-1=2. So the line is ' ' *1 + line + ' ' *2. So total length is 1 +7+2=10. Then surrounded by *.

Yes. Then the next line is an empty line. Wait, in the first sample input, the input is:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Wait, that's 5 lines. The sample output shows 7 lines (excluding borders). Oh wait, the sample input's first example shows:

Input:

This is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is 5 lines. The sample output shows 7 lines (including the empty line in the output). Wait, the first sample output has an empty line between "This is" and "Codeforces". Wait, the sample output shows:

* This  is *

*          *

*Codeforces*

So that's the first three lines of the framed text. How does that happen? The input lines are:

Line 1: "This  is" (length 7)

Line 2: "Codeforces" (length 10)

Line 3: "Beta" (length 4)

Line 4: "Round" (length 5)

Line 5: "5" (length 1)

But the output shows six lines (excluding the borders). Wait, in the sample output:

Between "This  is" and "Codeforces" there's a line with "*          *". Which is an empty line. So that must be from an input line that's empty. But according to the sample input given, where is that empty line?

Wait, the sample input as shown in the first example is:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is 5 lines. So the output shows 5 lines in the frame, but the sample output shows seven lines (including the borders). Wait, no. The borders are top and bottom. The inner lines are 5 lines. But the sample output has 5 lines of input, plus two borders. So the output is 7 lines.

But in the sample output, after "This is" there's an empty line. So why is that?

Ah, wait no. Looking at the sample input:

The input is five lines, but the sample output shows six lines (excluding borders). Wait, the sample output in the first example is:

************

* This  is *

*          *

*Codeforces*

*   Beta   *

*  Round   *

*     5    *

************

So between the first line and the third line (Codeforces), there's an empty line. That suggests that in the input, there is an empty line. But according to the sample input given, the input is the five lines listed. So perhaps there's a mistake in the sample input.

Wait, perhaps the actual input for the first sample is:

This  is

(empty line)

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

But that's not what the sample input shows. Oh, the user's first sample input is written as:

Sample Input 1:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is five lines. But the output has seven lines (including the empty line). So how does that happen? Because the code would process five lines. So the output would have 5 lines between the borders. But the sample output shows six lines (the borders plus six lines inside). Wait, the sample output shows:

The output has:

Line 1: ************ (border)

Line 2: * This  is *

Line3: *          *

Line4: *Codeforces*

Line5: *   Beta   *

Line6: *  Round   *

Line7: *     5    *

Line8: ************

So that's 8 lines total. The input must have six lines. Wait, no. The input lines are five. So perhaps there's a mistake in the sample input.

Wait, maybe the sample input has a sixth line that's empty. Let's recheck.

The first sample input as given:

Input:

This is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

So five lines. But the output shows six lines in the framed area. Because the borders are top and bottom. The framed text's inner lines are the original lines plus an empty line. So perhaps the input has a line that's empty. Wait, perhaps the first sample input actually includes an empty line. Let me check the problem statement again.

Looking at the first sample input and output:

The input is:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is five lines. But the output has six lines (the borders are two lines, and the inner lines are 5+1? No, the sample output shows 6 lines between the borders. Wait the sample output shows:

************

* This  is *

*          *

*Codeforces*

*   Beta   *

*  Round   *

*     5    *

************

So that's 7 lines in total (top and bottom borders, and 5+2 lines inside? No, no. Wait, the borders are the first and last lines. Then, the lines in between are the processed lines from the input. So if there are 5 input lines, the output would have 5 lines between the borders. But the sample shows 6 lines (from the 5 input lines plus one empty line). So this suggests that the input has an empty line. So perhaps the actual input has six lines, including an empty line.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's sample input for the first case is incorrect, but the actual input includes an empty line. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is adding empty lines. But why would that happen? Let's see.

In the first sample input, the code reads five lines. The maximum line length is 10 (Codeforces). Then, each line is processed.

The line "This is" is 7 characters. total_padding is 3 (10-7=3). So left is 1, right 2. So the line is surrounded by spaces and asterisks. Then, the next line is "Codeforces", which has length 10. So no padding. Then "Beta" (4), which has 10-4=6 padding. 6 is even: 3 left and 3 right. Then "Round" (5) has 5 padding (10-5=5). Since this is the second occurrence of an odd padding (the first was "This is"), the shift is now 1. So for "Round", total_padding is 5 (odd). shift was 1 (from previous line). So left = (5+1)/2 =3, right=5-3=2. So line is '   Round   ' (left 3, right 2? Wait 3 +5 +2=10. Then the line "Round" becomes '   Round   ' (with 3 left, 2 right). Then "5" is 1 character. total_padding is 9. 9 is odd. So shift is 0 again? Wait, let's track the shift.

Processing lines:

First line: "This  is" (len 7). total_padding 3 (odd). shift starts as 0. So left=1, right=2. shift becomes 1.

Second line: "Codeforces" (len 10). total_padding 0. shift remains 1.

Third line: "Beta" (len4). total_padding 6 (even). shift remains 1.

Fourth line: "Round" (len5). total_padding 5 (odd). since shift is 1, left = (5+1)//2 =3. right=5-3=2. shift becomes 0.

Fifth line: "5" (len1). total_padding 9 (odd). shift is 0. So left=9//2=4. right=5. So line becomes '    5    ' (left 4, right 5? 4+1+5=10. So line is '    5    ' with 4 spaces left and 5 right. So the line is surrounded by asterisks.

But the sample output shows the line for "5" as *     5    * which is 4 left, 5 right. So yes.

But where does the empty line come from in the first sample output? The third line of the framed output (after the first line) is *          * (empty line). That suggests that in the input, there's an empty line between "This is" and "Codeforces". So perhaps the sample input has a blank line. But according to the user's sample input, it's written as:

Input:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is five lines. So why does the output have an empty line? That's a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the sample input.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input has an empty line. For example, the actual input may have six lines, with an empty line between "This is" and "Codeforces". Let's check the sample output again.

Sample output 1:

The lines in the framed area are:

* This  is *

*          *

*Codeforces*

*   Beta   *

*  Round   *

*     5    *

So six lines. So the input must have six lines. Therefore, the actual sample input is:

This is

(empty line)

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is six lines. But the user's sample input shows five lines. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is incorrect, but the actual code should handle cases with empty lines.

But regardless, according to the problem statement, the code must read all lines given in the input, including empty ones.

So the code as outlined should handle empty lines, because when a line is empty (len 0), the code will pad it to max_len. For example, in the first sample, if there's an empty line, then for that line, the len is 0. The total_padding would be max_len (10) - 0 = 10. 10 is even. So left and right are 5 each. So the line becomes '          ' (10 spaces), surrounded by asterisks. Which is what the sample output shows.

So the code as written would handle empty lines correctly.

Therefore, the code's approach is correct.

Now, testing the first sample input. Let's imagine that the input is:

This  is

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Which is five lines. The max_len is 10 (Codeforces). The code processes each line.

Line 1: len 7. total_padding 3 (odd). shift is 0. left 1, right 2. line becomes ' This  is  ' (1 left, 2 right). So the output is * This  is  *. But the sample output shows * This  is * (but in the sample output, the line is "This  is" padded with 1 left and 2 right, leading to 1 +7 +2=10, which is correct. The sample output shows "This  is" with left 1 and right 2. So the code would generate that.

But in the sample output, there is a line with *          *, which is empty. How does that happen? Because that line must correspond to an empty line in the input. So perhaps the sample input is not as written, and there's an empty line between the first and second lines.

So, in code, the code as written would read all lines, including empty ones. So if the input is:

This is

(empty line)

Codeforces

Beta

Round

5

Then, the code would generate the correct output.

Therefore, the code's logic is correct, and the sample input must have an empty line.

Therefore, the code should read all lines, including empty ones.

Thus, the code as written should handle all cases correctly.

Now, let's test the code against the second sample input:

Sample Input 2:

welcome to the

Codeforces

Beta

Round 5

and

good luck

Sample Output 2:

****************

*welcome to the*

*  Codeforces  *

*     Beta     *

*   Round 5    *

*              *

*      and     *

*  good luck   *

****************

So the input lines are:

Line 0: "welcome to the" (len 13)

Line 1: "Codeforces" (len 10)

Line 2: "Beta" (len4)

Line3: "Round 5" (len6)

Line4: empty line (len 0)

Line5: "and" (len3)

Line6: "good luck" (len8)

So max_len is 13.

For each line:

Line0: len13. total_padding 0. output is *welcome to the*.

Line1: len10. total_padding 3. 3 is odd. shift starts as 0. left=1, right=2. output *  Codeforces  * (1 left, 2 right). Then shift becomes 1.

Line2: len4. total_padding 9. 9 is odd. since shift is 1, left = (9+1)/2 =5, right=4. output *     Beta     * (5 left, 4 right). shift becomes 0.

Line3: len6. total_padding 7. odd. shift is 0. left=3, right=4. output *   Round 5    * (3 left, 4 right). shift becomes 1.

Line4: len0. total_padding 13. even. left=6, right=6. output *             * (13 spaces). shift remains 1.

Line5: len3. total_padding 10. even. left=5, right=5. output *      and     * (5 left,5 right). shift remains 1.

Line6: len8. total_padding 5. odd. shift is 1. left= (5+1)/2=3. right=5-3=2. output *  good luck   * (3 left, 2 right). shift becomes 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Therefore, the code's logic is correct.

Now, code implementation:

But in Python, when you read lines via sys.stdin, trailing newlines are included. So using line.rstrip('\n') will remove the trailing newline. However, lines may have their own trailing newlines, but according to the problem statement, the input lines cannot start or end with spaces. So, when a line is empty (zero length), it's allowed.

Therefore, the code is correct as written.

So the code is as follows:

Read all lines, strip the trailing newlines.

Compute max_len.

Process each line, tracking the shift.

So, the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in input_stream]

    max_len = max(len(line) for line in lines) if lines else 0

    border = '*' * (max_len + 2)

    result = [border]

    shift = 0  # 0 for left first, 1 for right first

    for line in lines:

        line_len = len(line)

        total_pad = max_len - line_len

        if total_pad == 0:

            result.append(f'*{line}*')

        else:

            if total_pad % 2 == 0:

                left = right = total_pad // 2

            else:

                if shift == 0:

                    left = total_pad // 2

                    right = total_pad - left

                    shift = 1

                else:

                    left = (total_pad + 1) // 2

                    right = total_pad - left

                    shift = 0

            padded_line = ' ' * left + line + ' ' * right

            result.append(f'*{padded_line}*')

    result.append(border)

    print('\n'.join(result), file=output_stream)

```

Yes. So the code is correct.

Now, what about the empty line in the input (assuming it exists):

The empty line's len is 0. max_len is 10. total_pad is 10. even. left and right are 5 each. So padded_line is 10 spaces. So the line becomes '*          *'.

Which is correct.

Therefore, the code is correct.

```python
import sys

lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in sys.stdin]
max_len = max(len(line) for line in lines) if lines else 0
border = '*' * (max_len + 2)
result = [border]
shift = 0

for line in lines:
    line_len = len(line)
    total_pad = max_len - line_len
    if total_pad == 0:
        result.append(f'*{line}*')
    else:
        if total_pad % 2 == 0:
            left = right = total_pad // 2
        else:

                right = total_pad - left
                shift = 1
            else:
                left = (total_pad + 1) // 2
                right = total_pad - left
                shift = 0
        padded_line = ' ' * left + line + ' ' * right
        result.append(f'*{padded_line}*')

result.append(border)
print('\n'.join(result))
