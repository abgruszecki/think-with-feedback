Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of integers between l and r (inclusive) that have the same first and last digit. The constraints are up to 1e18, so iterating each number directly is impossible. So I need a smart way to calculate this without checking every number.

First, let's think about how to find numbers where the first and last digits are the same. For example, 1231: first digit 1, last 1. So how can I count these numbers efficiently?

The key is to find for each possible first and last digit (which must be the same), how many numbers in [l, r] have that property. But since first and last are the same, maybe we can model numbers as starting and ending with the same digit, and count how many such numbers exist in the interval.

But how to compute that? Let's break it down by the number of digits. For numbers with d digits, how many start and end with the same digit?

Let's think for d-digit numbers. For example, d=1: all numbers from 1 to 9 are valid. So 9 numbers. For d=2: numbers like 11, 22, ..., 99. Also 9 numbers. For d=3: the first and last digits must be the same. The middle digits can be anything. So for a 3-digit number: first digit (1-9), last digit same as first, middle digit (0-9). So 9 * 10 = 90 numbers. Similarly, for d=4: first and last same, the two middle digits can be anything. So 9 * 10^2. So in general, for d digits, the count is 9 * 10^(d-2), unless d=1, where it's 9.

But wait, this is for all d-digit numbers. But when we have a range that's not covering the entire d-digit numbers, we need to adjust. So the approach would be to precompute the count for all possible d-digit numbers and then subtract those that are outside the [l, r] range.

So the plan is:

1. Generate all numbers where first and last digits are the same, and count how many of them are in [l, r].

But generating all such numbers isn't feasible for large d. So we need a mathematical approach.

Another approach is to, for each possible first digit (1-9), and each possible number of digits (from the min digits in l to the max in r), compute how many numbers in [l, r] start and end with that digit.

But how to compute that for a given first and last digit (same) and a certain digit length?

Alternatively, for each possible digit d (1-9), and for each possible length of the number, calculate how many numbers of that length start and end with d, and lie within [l, r].

So let's structure it as:

For each digit s in 1..9:

   For each possible number of digits k (from 1 to 18):

      Compute the minimal and maximal numbers of k digits that start and end with s. Then find the intersection of [min, max] with [l, r], and add the count of such numbers.

But how to compute the min and max for a given s and k?

For example, k=1: min and max are s (since it's a single digit). So if s is between l and r, count 1.

For k=2: numbers are s followed by s. So 11, 22, ..., 99. So min and max are s*11 (like 11, 22, etc.)

For k>2: the first digit is s, last is s. The middle digits can be anything. So the minimal number is s followed by k-2 zeros and s. The maximal is s followed by k-2 9's and s.

Wait, for example, k=3, s=5: minimal is 505, maximal 595. Then any number between 505 and 595 where the first and last digits are 5. So all numbers 5xx5, where xx can be any two digits (from 00 to 99). So there are 100 numbers here. Which is 10^(3-2) * 9 (the 9 comes from s ranges 1-9). Wait, for s=5, it's 1*10^(3-2) = 10^(1) = 10? Wait, no. For k=3, the middle digits can be any (k-2) digits. So 10^(k-2) numbers for each s. So for s=5, k=3: 10^(3-2) = 10 numbers? Wait, 505, 515, ..., 595. Oh wait, the middle digits can be anything. So for k=3, s=5: numbers from 500 + 5 (505?), no. Wait, the first digit is 5, the last is 5. The middle digits can be any digits. So for k=3, the middle digit can be 0-9, so 10 possibilities. So total 10 numbers. Wait, 5005? No, k=3 is 3 digits. So 5 _ 5. So 505, 515, 525, ..., 595. So yes, 10 numbers. So for each s and k, the count is 10^(k-2) when k >=2. For k=1, it's 1 per s.

So for a given s and k, the total numbers that start and end with s is:

if k == 1: 1 if s is between 1 and 9 (which it is here)

else: 10^(k-2)

But this is only for numbers with exactly k digits.

So for each s in 1-9, and each possible k (from 1 to 18), compute the numbers of exactly k digits, starting and ending with s. Then, for each such group, calculate how many of them are in [l, r], and sum all these counts.

The problem then reduces to:

For each s and k:

   Find the minimal number in this group (s followed by (k-2) zeros and s if k>1, else s)

   Find the maximal number in this group (s followed by (k-2) 9s and s if k>1, else s)

   Then, compute how many numbers in [l, r] are between min and max, inclusive.

   The count for this s and k is max(0, (upper - lower + 1)) where lower is max(l, min), upper is min(r, max).

   Multiply this count by 1 (since each number in the group starts and ends with s), but wait no, because all numbers in the group have exactly k digits, start and end with s, and the middle digits can vary. So the entire group is the numbers from min to max, stepping by ...? Wait, no. For example, in k=3, s=5: the numbers are 505, 515, 525, ..., 595. Wait, that's stepping by 10. So the numbers are 500 + 10*d +5, where d is 0-9. So yes, 10 numbers. So the min is 505, max 595. The step is 10. So all numbers in the group are of the form 5xx5 where xx is two digits (but for k=3, it's one digit in the middle). So for k=3, the group is all numbers between 5*100 + x*10 +5, where x is 0-9. So the minimal is 505, maximal 595.

But how do these numbers form a continuous range? Because 505, 515, ..., 595 are each 10 apart. So the entire group is min, min+10, ..., max. So the numbers are min, min+10, ..., max. So the count is (max - min)/10 +1.

Wait, but 10 numbers in the group for k=3. So (595 -505)/10 +1 = 90/10 +1=9+1=10. Which matches.

So the group is a sequence of numbers starting at min, ending at max, with step 10^(k-2 - 1) + 1? Wait, perhaps the numbers in the group can be represented as a range, but how?

Alternatively, when the first and last digits are fixed, the middle digits can vary freely, so the numbers form a continuous block. Wait no. For example, with k=4, s=5: the numbers are 5005, 5015, 5025, ..., 5995. So the step is 10. So between 5005 and 5995, the numbers that start and end with 5 are every 10 numbers. So the group is not a continuous range, but numbers in steps.

Wait, no. For example, 5005, 5015, 5025, etc. The difference between consecutive numbers is 10. So the numbers are in arithmetic progression, step 10. So the entire group is min, min+10, min+20, ..., max.

So for any group (s, k), the count of numbers is (max - min) // step + 1. But step is 10^{d-2} where d is the number of digits. Wait, no. Let's see for k=3: step is 10. For k=4: step is 10. Because in k=4, the first digit is s, the last is s, the middle two digits can be anything. So the numbers are s followed by two digits, then s. For example, s=5, k=4: 5xx5, where xx is any two digits. So 5005, 5015, ..., 5995. So between 5005 and 5995, each step is 10. So the step is 10^(k-2 - 1) * 10? Maybe. For k=3, step is 10. For k=4, step is 10. For k=5, step would be 10 again. Because the middle digits can be anything, but the last digit is fixed. So between any two consecutive numbers in the group, the difference is 10. So the step is 10 for k >=2.

Wait, that's a key insight. Because the last digit is fixed (s), the next number in the group would be s followed by (digits +1) and s. For example, 505 to 515 is +10, 515 to 525 is +10, etc. Similarly, 5005 to 5015 is +10. So regardless of the number of digits (as long as >=2), the step between consecutive numbers in the group is 10.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the first digit is s, the last digit is s. The middle digits can vary. So the numbers can be written as s * 10^{k-1} + middle * 10 + s. So when you increment the middle by 1, you add 10 to the entire number. So the step is 10.

So for any k >=2, the numbers in the group form an arithmetic sequence starting at s*10^{k-1} + s (for k=2, that's 10*s + s = 11*s), then each next number is +10, up to s*10^{k-1} + (10^{k-2} -1)*10 + s.

Wait, for example, k=3, s=5:

The first number is 5*10^2 + 0*10 +5 = 500 + 5 = 505.

The next is 515, 525, ..., 595 (max is 5*10^2 + 9*10 +5 = 500 +90 +5=595).

The step between them is 10. So for k digits, the step is 10.

So for any k >=2, the group is an arithmetic sequence starting at min_val, ending at max_val, with step 10.

So the count of numbers in the group for s and k is (max_val - min_val) // 10 + 1.

But for the entire group (all numbers of k digits, starting and ending with s), the count is 10^(k-2) numbers. Because for k digits, there are (k-2) middle digits, each with 10 options.

So for example, k=3: 10^(3-2) = 10 numbers.

But in the arithmetic sequence, (max_val - min_val) //10 +1 = (595-505)/10 +1 = 9+1=10, which matches.

So, this approach is correct.

Now, the problem reduces to, for each possible s (1-9) and k (1-18 digits), compute the min_val and max_val for numbers starting and ending with s, with exactly k digits. Then, compute how many numbers in [l, r] lie within the arithmetic sequence min_val, min_val+10, ..., max_val.

Wait, but the min_val and max_val for the group can be computed as follows:

For k=1:

min_val = s

max_val = s

count is 1 if s is in [l, r], else 0.

For k >=2:

min_val is s * 10^{k-1} + s.

But wait, s is the first digit. So for example, for k=2, s=3: 3 followed by 3 (33). So 3*10 +3 =33.

For k=3, s=3: 3*100 + 0*10 +3=303. Then adding 10 each step: 313, 323, ..., 393. So min_val is 303, max_val 393.

Wait, but for k=3, the middle digits can be anything from 0-9. So the min is when the middle digits are 0, the max when the middle digits are 9. So min_val = s * 10^{k-1} + s.

Wait, that's not correct. Let's think again.

Wait, for k digits, the first digit is s, the last is s. The middle digits (k-2 digits) can be anything.

So the minimal number is when the middle digits are all 0: s followed by (k-2) zeros, then s. For example, k=3: s 0 s → s*100 +0*10 +s = s*101.

The maximal number is when the middle digits are all 9: s followed by (k-2) 9s, then s. So s*10^{k-1} + (10^{k-2} -1)*10 + s.

Wait, for example, k=3, s=5: minimal is 5 0 5 = 505, maximal 5 9 5 = 595. Which is correct.

So the min_val for k digits and s is s * (10^{k-1} + 1).

Because for k=3: 10^2 +1 = 101 → s*101.

Similarly, for k=2: 10^1 +1=11 → s*11.

For k=4: 10^3 +1=1001 → s*1001.

But then, the max_val would be s * (10^{k-1} + 1) + (10^{k-2} - 1)*10.

Wait, let's see for k=3, s=5:

max_val = 5*1001 + (10^{1} -1)*10 → 5*(100+1) +9*10 → 505 +90=595. Which is correct.

Alternatively, another way: the maximum is s followed by k-2 9's and s. So for k=3, s=5: 5 9 5 → 595.

Which can be written as 5*10^2 + 9*10 +5 =500 +90 +5=595.

So for the maximum: s * 10^{k-1} + (10^{k-2} -1)*10 + s.

Which can be factored as s*(10^{k-1} +1) + 10*(10^{k-2} -1).

But this seems complex. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute min_val and max_val as:

min_val = s * 10^{k-1} + s → but wait, for k=2, this is s*10 + s = 11s → correct.

For k=3: s*100 + s = s*101 → which is correct. For example, s=5: 505, which is the first number in the group.

The max_val is s * 10^{k-1} + (10^{k-1} - 10) + s → ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to construct the max_val as s followed by all 9's in the middle digits and s. So the middle digits are all 9's.

The number would be s * 10^{k-1} + 999... (k-2 digits) *10 + s.

For example, k=3: 5*100 + 99*10 +5 → 500 + 990 +5 = 1495? No, that's for k=4.

Wait, no. For k=3, the middle digits are 1 digit. So for max_val, middle digit is 9. So 5*100 +9*10 +5 = 500 +90 +5=595.

Which is correct.

So for general k:

The middle digits (k-2 digits) are all 9's. So the number is s followed by (k-2) 9's and s.

So the value is s * 10^{k-1} + (10^{k-2} -1)*10 + s.

Because 99...9 (k-2 digits) is 10^{k-2} -1 → multiplying by 10 shifts it left by one digit (since the last digit is s). So for example, k=3: 10^1 -1 =9 → 9*10=90. Then adding s gives s*100 +90 +s = s*(100+1) +90 → 101s +90. Wait, but for s=5 and k=3, 5*100 + 90 +5=595, which is correct.

But this expression may be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the maximum as (s * 10^{k-1}) + ( (10^{k-2} -1) ) *10 + s.

Which is s *10^{k-1} + ( (10^{k-2} -1)*10 ) + s.

So for k=3, 10^{k-2} = 10^1=10 → (10-1)*10=90. So 500 +90 +5=595.

So for the max_val, it's s * (10^{k-1} +1) + 9*10^{k-2} * (10^{k-2}-1) ?

Not sure. But regardless, for a given s and k, we can compute min_val and max_val.

Once we have min_val and max_val, the numbers in the group form an arithmetic sequence starting at min_val, increasing by 10 each step, up to max_val.

So the total numbers in this group is (max_val - min_val) // 10 +1.

Which equals the count of numbers in the group.

But how to compute the number of elements in [l, r] that are in this arithmetic sequence.

So the approach is:

For each s in 1-9:

   For each k from 1 to 18:

      Compute min_val and max_val for (s, k).

      Now, find the overlap between [l, r] and [min_val, max_val].

      If there is no overlap, skip.

      Else, compute the lower = max(l, min_val), upper = min(r, max_val).

      Then, check if lower > upper: if so, skip.

      Else, how many numbers in [lower, upper] are in the arithmetic sequence (min_val, step=10).

      The first number >= lower is ceil((lower - min_val) /10) steps from min_val. But since the sequence is min_val, min_val+10, min_val+20, etc., the first number >= lower is min_val + t*10, where t is the smallest integer such that min_val + t*10 >= lower.

      Similarly, the last number <= upper is min_val + t*10 <= upper.

      The count is ((last - first) //10 ) +1.

But perhaps a better way is to compute the first number in the sequence >= lower, and the last number <= upper.

If the first number exceeds upper, then there's 0.

Else, the count is (last - first) //10 +1.

So let's code this part.

But let's think of it as:

The numbers in the sequence are those x where x ≡ min_val mod 10.

But since the step is 10, the numbers are min_val, min_val+10, ..., max_val.

So x must be >= lower, <= upper.

So the first x is max( min_val, lower + ( (min_val - lower) %10 +10 ) %10 )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively:

The first number in the sequence >= lower.

The first x is the smallest x >= lower such that x ≡ min_val mod 10.

But min_val mod 10 is s, since min_val is s followed by ... s.

So for example, min_val=505 → 505 mod 10=5. All numbers in the sequence are 515, 525, etc., mod 10 is 5.

So the first number >= lower is the smallest x >= lower where x mod 10 == s.

Similarly, the last number <= upper is the largest x <= upper where x mod 10 == s.

So how to compute that?

The first x can be computed as follows:

If lower mod 10 <= s:

   possible x = lower - (lower mod 10) + s.

   if this is < lower, then add 10.

Else:

   possible x = lower - (lower mod 10) + s + 10.

Wait, maybe a better way:

The first x in the sequence (mod 10 is s) that is >= lower.

The initial candidate is lower + (s - (lower %10)) if (lower %10) <= s.

Otherwise, it's lower + (s - (lower %10) + 10).

But let's see.

For example, lower=507, s=5.

lower mod10 is7. Since 7>5, so need to add (5 -7 +10)=8. So x=507+8=515. Which is the first number >=507 with last digit 5.

Yes.

Another example: lower=500. s=5. mod10 is0. 0 <=5. So candidate is500 +5=505. Which is >=500. So yes.

So the formula for the first x is:

remainder = lower %10

if remainder <=s:

   first_candidate = lower - remainder + s

else:

   first_candidate = lower + (s - remainder +10)

But then, if first_candidate < lower, we need to adjust.

Wait, no. Let's think:

If remainder <=s:

   candidate = lower - remainder + s.

   If this is >= lower, then it's the first x.

   Otherwise, add 10.

Wait, no. For example, lower=500, s=5: candidate is500 -0 +5=505 >=500. So yes.

If lower=503, s=5. remainder is3 <=5. candidate=503-3 +5=505. Which is >=503. 505 is 503's next 5 in the last digit.

If lower=505, same as candidate:505.

If lower=510, s=5. remainder is0. candidate=510 +5=515. Which is next.

But wait, no: 510's last digit is 0. The next x with last digit5 is515.

Yes.

Wait, but in this case, the formula gives 510 -0 +5=515.

Yes.

So the formula works.

But what if the candidate is < lower?

Suppose lower=506, s=5. remainder=6 >5.

So candidate is506 + (5-6+10) =506+9=515. Which is >=506.

So the formula holds.

But what if the remainder is 6 and s is 5. The candidate is 506 + (5-6+10) =506+9=515.

Yes.

So the formula for first_candidate is:

if (lower %10) <=s:

   first_candidate = lower - (lower%10) +s

else:

   first_candidate = lower + (s - (lower%10) +10)

But after computing first_candidate, we have to check if it's >= lower.

If yes, then it's the first x. If not, then add 10.

Wait, but in the formula, when remainder <=s:

lower - remainder + s >= lower - remainder + 0 (since s >=1). But since remainder <=s, s - remainder >=0. So adding that to lower - remainder gives lower - remainder + s = lower + (s - remainder) >= lower.

So first_candidate >= lower.

Similarly, in the else case: s - remainder +10 can be written as (10 - (remainder -s)). Since remainder >s. For example, remainder=7, s=5: 10 - (7-5) =8. So added to lower gives 506 +8=514. But 514's last digit is4, which is not s. Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, the candidate in the else case is lower + (s - remainder +10). Let's compute this.

In the example lower=506 (mod10=6), s=5. The formula gives 506 + (5-6 +10) =506 +9=515. Which is correct. 515 mod10=5, and >=506.

So the formula seems to work.

So first_candidate is computed as:

if (lower %10) <=s:

   first_candidate = lower - (lower%10) +s

else:

   first_candidate = lower + (s - (lower%10) +10)

Once we have first_candidate, we check if first_candidate > upper. If so, there are 0 numbers. Else, proceed.

Similarly, the last x is the largest number <= upper and mod10 is s.

To compute the last_candidate:

remainder = upper %10

if remainder >=s:

   last_candidate = upper - (remainder -s)

else:

   last_candidate = upper - (remainder + 10 -s)

But wait, let's test.

upper=515, s=5. remainder=5. >=5: last_candidate=515 -0=515.

upper=514, s=5. remainder=4. <5. So upper - (4+10 -5)=514 -9=505. Which is correct.

upper=505, s=5: 505.

upper=516, s=5: remainder 6 >=5. last_candidate=516 - (6-5) =515.

Yes.

So the formula for last_candidate is:

if (upper %10) >=s:

   last_candidate = upper - (upper%10 -s)

else:

   last_candidate = upper - (upper%10 +10 -s)

But this can be written as:

last_candidate = upper - ((upper%10 -s) %10)

But perhaps the initial approach is better.

Once we have first_candidate and last_candidate, check if first_candidate > upper or last_candidate < lower. If so, then no numbers.

Else, the count is ((last_candidate - first_candidate) //10) +1.

But we also need to make sure that first_candidate >= lower and last_candidate <= upper.

Because first_candidate is the first x >= lower, and last_candidate is the last x <= upper.

So the steps are:

Compute first_candidate and last_candidate as per above.

If first_candidate > upper or last_candidate < lower → 0.

Else:

   The count is (last_candidate - first_candidate) //10 +1.

So this is how to calculate the count for a given s and k.

Now, the problem is to iterate over all s (1-9) and k (1-18), compute for each (s, k) the min_val and max_val (the entire group's min and max), then compute the overlap with [l, r], and then count the numbers in the arithmetic sequence (step 10) that are in [l, r].

But first, we need to compute min_val and max_val for each s and k.

But for very large k (like 18), 10^k is a very large number. So we need to compute it carefully.

In Python, exponentiation with large exponents is manageable, but for 1e18, but since k is up to 18, 10^17 is manageable as a Python integer.

So, for each s in 1-9:

   for k in 1 to 18:

      if k ==1:

          min_val = s

          max_val = s

      else:

          min_val = s * (10**(k-1)) + s

          # Wait, no. For k=2: 10^1 =10. s*10 +s =11s → correct.

          # For k=3: s*100 +s → 101s → 505 for s=5.

          # Then the step is 10, as discussed.

          # The max_val for k digits is s *10^{k-1} + (10^{k-2}-1)*10 +s.

          # For example, k=3: 5*100 + (10^1 -1)*10 +5 =500 + 9*10 +5=500+90+5=595.

          max_val = s * 10**(k-1) + (10**(k-2) -1)*10 + s

      # Now compute the arithmetic sequence [min_val, max_val] step 10.

      # But wait, for k >=2, the min_val is s followed by 0's and s, which is the first term.

      # The max_val is s followed by 9's and s, which is the last term.

      # So the sequence is min_val, min_val+10, ..., max_val.

      # So the min_val and max_val here are correct.

      # Now, compute the overlap between [min_val, max_val] and [l, r].

      # The lower and upper are max(l, min_val) and min(r, max_val).

      # But wait, the entire group's min and max are min_val and max_val. So the numbers in the group are between min_val and max_val.

      # So for the group (s, k), the arithmetic sequence is from min_val to max_val, step 10.

      # So for the group, the numbers in the sequence are those x where x >= min_val, x <= max_val, x mod10 ==s.

      # So the code for this group is:

      # compute for the group's min and max, and see if they overlap with [l, r].

      # Then find the first and last x in the group that are within [l, r], then compute count.

      # But since the group is all numbers of k digits starting and ending with s, and the step is 10, then the code for the count is as before.

But how to compute min_val and max_val for very large k?

In Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so no problem.

So the steps are:

Read l and r.

Initialize total =0.

For each s in 1..9:

   For k in 1..18:

      compute min_val and max_val.

      # check if k is possible. For example, numbers with k digits must be >= 10^{k-1} (if k>1).

      # for example, a 3-digit number is >=100.

      # but since min_val is s*10^{k-1} +s for k>=2.

      # but for k=2, s=1: 11, which is 2 digits.

      # So no problem.

      # Now, compute the min and max for the group.

      if k ==1:

          group_min = s

          group_max = s

      else:

          group_min = s * (10 ** (k-1)) + s

          group_max = s * (10 ** (k-1)) + (10 ** (k-2) -1) * 10 + s

      # Now, the group's numbers are from group_min to group_max, step 10.

      # So the entire group is in [group_min, group_max], and all x in group have x mod10 ==s.

      # Now, find the overlap between [group_min, group_max] and [l, r].

      lower = max(l, group_min)

      upper = min(r, group_max)

      if lower > upper:

          continue

      # Now, within [lower, upper], count the numbers x where x mod10 ==s.

      # The numbers are in arithmetic sequence step 10, starting at group_min.

      # So find first x >= lower in the sequence, and last x <= upper in the sequence.

      # compute first_candidate and last_candidate as before.

      # compute first_candidate:

      remainder_lower = lower %10

      if remainder_lower <= s:

          first_candidate = lower - remainder_lower + s

      else:

          first_candidate = lower + (s - remainder_lower +10)

      # check if first_candidate is less than lower? No, because in the first case, remainder_lower <=s → s >= remainder_lower → lower - remainder_lower +s >= lower.

      # for example, lower=5, remainder_lower=5, s=5 → 5-5+5=5 >=5.

      # in the else case: s < remainder_lower → first_candidate = lower + (s - remainder_lower +10) = lower + (10 - (remainder_lower - s)). Since remainder_lower -s is between 1 and9, 10 - (..) is between 1 and9. So first_candidate = lower + (positive number) → >= lower.

      # So first_candidate >= lower.

      # but wait: first_candidate can be larger than upper.

      if first_candidate > upper:

          continue

      # compute last_candidate:

      remainder_upper = upper %10

      if remainder_upper >= s:

          last_candidate = upper - (remainder_upper -s)

      else:

          last_candidate = upper - (remainder_upper +10 -s)

      if last_candidate < lower:

          continue

      # Now, check if last_candidate <= upper.

      # Because upper - (remainder_upper -s) can be <= upper.

      # for example, upper=515, remainder_upper=5, s=5: 515-0=515 → okay.

      # upper=514, s=5: remainder_upper=4. So last_candidate=514 - (4+10-5) =514-9=505.

      # 505 <=514 → okay.

      # So last_candidate is <=upper.

      # Now, check if first_candidate <= last_candidate.

      if first_candidate > last_candidate:

          continue

      # compute the count.

      count = (last_candidate - first_candidate) //10 +1

      total +=count

So, for each (s, k) group, we compute the count and add to total.

This approach should handle all possible numbers in the range.

Now, let's test this logic against the examples.

First example:

Input: 2 47 → Output: 12.

We need to find all numbers between 2 and 47 inclusive that start and end with same digit.

The correct numbers are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 11,22,33,44 → 12 numbers.

Let's see what the code would compute.

For each s from 1-9 and k from 1-2 (since 47 is 2-digit).

s=1:

k=1: group_min=1, group_max=1. overlap with [2,47] → no.

k=2: group_min=11, group_max=11. So check [11,11]. The count is 1 (11 is in the range). So adds 1.

s=2:

k=1: group_min=2, group_max=2. in range → add 1.

k=2: group_min=22, group_max=22. in range → add 1. So total for s=2 is 2.

s=3: k=1 →3 in range →1. k=2:33 in range →1. total 2.

Similarly for s=4: k=1:4 →1. k=2:44 in range →1. Total 2.

s=5: k=1:5 in range. k=2:55 is 55>47 → no. So total 1.

s=6: k=1:6. k=2:66>47 → no. total 1.

s=7: same as 6 → total 1.

s=8: same →1.

s=9: same →1.

Then for s=1, k=1: 1 is not in [2,47], but k=2's group is 11, which is in. So total from s=1 is 1.

s=5-9: for k=1, their numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. All are in [2,47]. So each contributes 1. So 5 numbers (s=5,6,7,8,9) each contribute 1 for k=1. So 5.

k=2 for s=5: group is 55 which is >47 → no.

So sum:

s=1: 1 (from k=2)

s=2: 2 (k=1 and 2)

s=3: 2

s=4: 2

s=5: 1 (k=1)

s=6:1

s=7:1

s=8:1

s=9:1

Total is 1+2+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=12. Which matches the example.

Another example: input 47 1024 → output 98.

But checking all possible numbers would be tedious. So let's assume the code works.

Now, handling very large numbers.

But how to compute 10^17 in Python? Well, 10 ** (k-1) is manageable.

But for k=18, 10^17 is 100000000000000000, which is a valid Python integer.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

But what about numbers with leading and trailing zeros? But according to the problem statement, the numbers are in decimal notation, so leading zeros are not allowed. So numbers like 0990 are not considered. So the code's approach of first digit being s (1-9) is correct.

Now, the code's steps:

Read l and r as integers.

Loop s from 1 to 9.

Loop k from 1 to 18.

For each (s, k), compute group_min and group_max.

Then compute the overlap with [l, r].

If overlap exists, compute first_candidate and last_candidate.

If they exist, compute count and add to total.

Now, code:

Now, implement this in Python.

But note that for k=1, group_min and group_max are s. So for k=1, the code checks if s is between l and r. So for example, s=2 and l=2, r=2 → count 1.

But in code, for k=1:

group_min = group_max =s.

lower = max(l, s).

upper = min(r, s).

If lower <= upper → which is only when s is in [l, r].

So in that case, the code computes first_candidate and last_candidate. For k=1, the group's min and max is s. So:

For example, s=5, l=5, r=5:

lower=5, upper=5.

remainder_lower=5%10=5.

since remainder_lower (5) <=s (5), first_candidate=5-5 +5=5.

last_candidate: remainder_upper=5%10=5. >=5 → last_candidate=5-0=5.

So count is (5-5)/10 +1 =0+1=1. Correct.

So code handles k=1.

Now, code:

Read l and r as integers.

Then, for s in 1-9:

   for k in 1 to 18:

      if k ==1:

          group_min = s

          group_max = s

      else:

          group_min = s * (10 ** (k-1)) + s

          group_max = s * (10 ** (k-1)) + (10 ** (k-2) -1)*10 + s

      lower = max(l, group_min)

      upper = min(r, group_max)

      if lower > upper:

          continue

      # compute first_candidate and last_candidate

      # first_candidate is first x >= lower, x mod10 ==s.

      remainder_lower = lower %10

      if remainder_lower <= s:

          first_candidate = lower - remainder_lower + s

      else:

          first_candidate = lower + (s - remainder_lower +10)

      if first_candidate > upper:

          continue

      # compute last_candidate

      remainder_upper = upper %10

      if remainder_upper >= s:

          last_candidate = upper - (remainder_upper -s)

      else:

          last_candidate = upper - (remainder_upper +10 -s)

      if last_candidate < lower:

          continue

      # ensure last_candidate <= upper and >= first_candidate

      if last_candidate < first_candidate:

          continue

      count = (last_candidate - first_candidate) //10 +1

      total += count

So code.

But wait, for k=1, group_min and group_max are s. So the code computes lower = max(l, s), upper = min(r, s). So if s is in [l, r], then lower and upper are s. Then, first_candidate is s, last_candidate is s. So count is (s -s)/10 +1= 0+1=1. Which is correct.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But note that for very large k, 10** (k-1) may be expensive to compute? But for k=18, it's 10^17, which is manageable in Python.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    l, r = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    total = 0

    for s in range(1, 10):
        for k in range(1, 19):
            if k == 1:
                group_min = s
                group_max = s
            else:
                power = 10 ** (k-1)
                group_min = s * power + s
                group_max = s * power + (10 ** (k-2) - 1) * 10 + s
            
            lower = max(l, group_min)
            upper = min(r, group_max)
            if lower > upper:
                continue
            
            # Calculate first candidate
            remainder_lower = lower % 10
            if remainder_lower <= s:
                first = lower - remainder_lower + s
            else:
                first = lower + (s - remainder_lower + 10)
            if first > upper:
                continue
            
            # Calculate last candidate
            remainder_upper = upper % 10
            if remainder_upper >= s:
                last = upper - (remainder_upper - s)
            else:
                last = upper - (remainder_upper + 10 - s)
            if last < lower:
                continue
            
            if first > last:
                continue
            
            count = (last - first) // 10 + 1
            total += count

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output

So the code works for the first example.

Now, code.
