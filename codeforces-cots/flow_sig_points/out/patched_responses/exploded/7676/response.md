<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of moves to transform string s into t. Each move allows moving the i-th character of s to either the beginning or the end. Hmm.

First, I need to check if it's even possible. If the characters in s and t don't have the same multiset, then it's impossible. So first step: check if the sorted versions of s and t are equal. If not, return -1.

Assuming the characters are possible, then how to find the minimum moves?

Each move can place a character either at the start or end. So each move can fix the position of a character in a certain way. The key is to find the longest possible subsequence of characters in s that can be arranged in the order of t without moving them. Because the remaining characters would need to be moved. The minimal number of moves would then be the total characters minus the length of this subsequence.

Wait, but how does the movement work? For example, when you move a character to the beginning or end, it affects the positions of other characters. But maybe the optimal approach is to find the longest sequence of characters in s that appear in the same order as in t. Because those characters can be kept in place (relative to each other) while moving the others around. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as finding the longest common subsequence between s and t. But no, because the order might not be exactly a subsequence. Wait, maybe the maximum matching is when we have a sequence of characters in s that can form a prefix of t. Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to find the longest suffix of t that can be formed by a subsequence of s, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of an example. Take the third test case in the first example input:

s = "tste" and t = "test". The optimal moves are moving the 'e' to the beginning (resulting in 'etst'), then moving the 't' (the second one) to the end to get 'test'. So two moves. 

Looking at the original s and t, the t is 'test'. Let's see how the characters in s can be arranged. The order in t is t-e-s-t. The original s is t-s-t-e. Hmm. The longest matching sequence is maybe 't', 's', 't' in s (positions 0,1,2), but in t the third character is 's', so that's position 2. So not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the longest substring in t that can be formed by a consecutive sequence in s. But that's not necessarily the case. Because moving a character to the front or end allows for rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: each move allows us to take a character from s and place it at the front or end. The minimal moves would be the number of characters not in their correct positions, but the exact arrangement depends on how they can be ordered.

Alternatively, think about building the target string t by selecting characters from s in a certain order, moving them to front or end. The key insight is that the order in which we fix the characters in t affects the number of moves. For example, if we can fix the first character of t by moving it to the front, then the remaining characters can be considered in the remaining positions.

Wait, but the movement of a character affects the positions of other characters. For instance, moving the i-th character to the front shifts all characters before i to the right by one. But after moving, the positions of the characters are adjusted. However, since each move is a single operation, perhaps the minimal number of moves is determined by the longest sequence of characters in s that are in the same order as in t, but not necessarily contiguous.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the problem of finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between s and t. The minimal number of moves required would be the length of s minus the length of the LCS. But wait, that's not correct. Because in the LCS model, the order is preserved, but the characters in between can be moved. However, in our problem, each move allows us to move a character to either end, which changes the order. So perhaps the minimal number of moves is indeed n minus the length of the longest sequence of characters that appears in both s and t in the same order. Because those characters can be left as is, and the others need to be moved once each.

But how to model this. Let's think: if there's a subsequence in s that matches a substring of t (but perhaps in a different order), then maybe those characters can be arranged in the correct positions by moving others. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to find the longest prefix of t that can be formed as a subsequence of s, possibly in a non-consecutive way. Then the minimal moves would be the length of the remaining characters. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the target string t. We need to arrange the characters in s into the order of t. Each move allows taking a character and putting it at either end. The minimal number of moves would be the number of characters not in their correct positions in the target sequence, but considering that some characters can be fixed in place through the movement of others.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves can be found by finding the longest sequence of characters in s that form a consecutive prefix of t. For example, if in s we can find a sequence of characters that matches the first k characters of t, then the remaining n -k characters can be moved once each. But how does that help?

Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's movement operations. When you move a character to the front, it's as if that character is fixed as the first character. Similarly, moving to the end fixes it as the last. But this is not exactly true, since moving another character later can affect the positions again. However, perhaps the optimal strategy is to fix the characters of t in order, starting from the left.

Wait, maybe we can model the problem by trying to find the longest possible chain of characters in s that appear in the same order as in t. The length of this chain would be the maximum number of characters that can be left in place (relative to each other) and thus not need to be moved. The minimal moves would then be n minus the length of this chain.

For example, in the first test case:

s = "iredppipe" (i r e d p p i p e)
t = "piedpiper"

The LCS-like approach would find the maximum matching order. Let's see. The target t is p i e d p i p e r. The LCS between s and t would be i e d p p i p e (length 8?), but maybe not. But the minimal moves are 2, which suggests that 9-7=2. So perhaps the LCS is 7.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the length of the longest prefix of t that can be formed as a subsequence from s. For example, if the first k characters of t can be found in order in s, then the remaining n -k characters need to be moved. But each move can be for one character, but perhaps the order in which you move them affects the total count. Hmm.

Wait, but in each move, you can take any character and move it to the front or end. So perhaps, after moving a character to the front, the rest of the characters can be adjusted as needed.

Another idea: the minimal number of moves is determined by the length of the longest chain of characters in s that can be arranged in the order they appear in t, possibly with other characters in between. For example, if the entire t can be formed as a subsequence of s in order, then no moves are needed. Otherwise, the minimal moves are the number of characters not in this chain.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the example 2: s is "estt" and t is "test". The minimal move is 1. The characters in s are e s t t. The target is t e s t. The LCS between s and t is e s t (length 3). So n - 3 = 1, which matches the answer.

Another example: in the third test case of the first input, s is "tste" and t is "test". The LCS length is 3 (t, s, t). So 4-3=1, but the answer is 2. So this approach is incorrect. Therefore, the LCS approach is not sufficient.

Hmm, so maybe the LCS idea is not the right approach. Let's think again.

What's different here? In the third test case, the LCS is 3 (the first t, s, t?), but the answer is 2. So according to this, 4-3=1 is not matching. So the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the movement operations allow us to arrange the characters in a way that the order of t is achieved by moving certain characters. The key is to find the maximum number of characters that are already in the correct relative order as in t, but not necessarily contiguous. But how to model this.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum number of characters that can be aligned in s and t in such a way that the order in t is preserved. This is similar to the problem of finding the longest common subsequence. But in the third example, the LCS would be t (from position 0 in s) and s (position 1 in s), t (position 2 in s). So length 3, but the answer requires two moves. So 4-3=1, but the answer is 2. So that suggests that the LCS approach is not working here. Therefore, that approach is invalid.

So perhaps another idea is needed.

Let's think of the process of building t from s. Each move allows us to take a character and place it either at the front or the end. So each move can fix a character's position. The minimal number of moves is the minimal number of steps to fix the characters in the order of t.

But how?

Another idea: For each character in t, starting from the first, check how many consecutive characters can be found in s in the same order. For example, in the third test case, t is 'test'. The first character is 't'. In s, it's at position 0. The next character in t is 'e', which in s is at position 3. Then 's' is at position 1. Then 't' is at position 2. So the order is 0,3,1,2. But the problem is that the 'e' comes after the first 't', but in t, the 'e' is after the first 't' and before the 's' and second 't'. So in s, the 'e' is after the first 't', but in s, the 's' comes before the 'e'. So when we move the 'e' to the front, the 's' is now in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the longest possible sequence in t that can be built by taking characters from s in order, allowing for overlapping but maintaining their relative order. Then, the minimal moves would be the total number of characters minus the length of this sequence. Because each character not in the sequence would need to be moved once.

But in the third test case, s is 'tste' (t, s, t, e), t is 'test' (t, e, s, t). The longest such sequence would be t (from position 0), e (position 3), s (position 1), t (position 2). So the length is 4. But that's not possible because the order in s is t, s, t, e. So the sequence t (0) then e (3) is allowed. Then s (1) comes after e (3) in s, but in t, s comes after e but before the second t. So perhaps the sequence is t (0), e (3), s (1), t (2). But the order in s is such that 0 < 3 < 1 < 2. However, the positions are not in order. So the sequence is t, e, s, t. But in s, the indices are 0,3,1,2. So the order in s is 0 < 1 < 2 <3? Wait, no. The indices are 0,1,2,3 for the characters. Wait, the original s is 'tste', which is index 0: t, 1: s, 2: t, 3: e. Oh wait, maybe I had the example wrong. Wait, in the third test case, the input is:

4

tste

test

So s is 'tste', which is characters t (0), s (1), t (2), e (3). t is 'test' which is t (0), e (1), s (2), t (3). So the desired order is t, e, s, t.

So in s, the characters are t, s, t, e. We need to form t, e, s, t.

So how to do this with two moves. The first move is moving the e (position 3) to the beginning, which would make the string e, t, s, t. Then, move the second t (position 3) to the end. But wait, moving the e to the beginning gives etst. Then moving the third character (s) to the end gives etts. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, according to the example explanation, the first move is moving the e to the beginning (so 'etst'), then moving the second t to the end (so 'etst' becomes 'ets' followed by moving the t (position 3) to the end, which is 'ets' t → 'etst'? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.

Alternatively, the steps are:

Original s is t s t e → "tste".

First move: take the e (position 3) and move to the beginning. Result is e t s t → "etst".

Second move: take the s (position 2) and move to the end. Result is e t t s → "etts"? That's not correct. Hmm, maybe the example explanation is different. Let me check:

In the third test case explanation:

s = tste → move to etst → then move to test. So how?

First move: moving e to the beginning (index 3 → move to front. So s becomes e t s t. Then, move the second t (position 2) to the end. So after moving, the s is at position 2. Let's see:

Original after first move: e t s t.

Now, move the 's' (position 2) to the end? That would make e t t s. No, that's not 'test'. Alternatively, maybe moving the 't' (position 3) to the end. Wait, in the string "etst" after the first move, the characters are e, t, s, t. The indices are 0,1,2,3.

So to get "test", which is t, e, s, t. So after the first move (etst), the next move would be to move the first 't' (position 1) to the end. That would give e s t t. No, that's not right. Hmm. The example explanation says that after the first move (etst), moving to etst → then to test. So perhaps the second move is moving the 'e' (position 0) to the end. That would move the e to the end, resulting in t s t e, which is back to original. That's not helpful. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement steps here.

Alternatively, maybe the first move is moving the 's' (position 1) to the end. Original s is t s t e. Moving position 1 (s) to the end gives t t e s. Then, moving the 'e' (position 2) to the beginning gives e t t s. Still not matching. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's focus back on the problem.

The key is to model the minimal number of moves needed. Each move allows us to take any character in the current s and move it to the front or the end. The goal is to reach t.

An alternative approach is to model this as a BFS problem, where each state is the current string s, and edges are the possible moves. However, since n can be up to 100, this approach is completely infeasible due to the exponential state space.

So we need a smarter way.

Let's think about the problem in terms of the positions of the characters in t. For example, the first character of t must come from some position in s. Once we decide to move that character to the front, the next character of t must come from the remaining positions (excluding those already fixed) but possibly in a certain order.

Alternatively, think of building t from left to right. For each position in t, we find the corresponding character in s and see if it can be part of a sequence that requires minimal moves.

Another idea is to model the problem as follows: for each character in t, find the earliest possible occurrence in s that comes after the previous character's occurrence. This is similar to finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between s and t. However, as we saw in the third example, this might not capture the required movement steps.

Wait, but perhaps in that third example, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t), which would suggest 4-3=1 move, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the LCS is not the right metric here. So what's different here?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to find the longest possible prefix of t that can be formed by a subsequence in s. Let's call this the maximum prefix length. The minimal number of moves is then n - this length. Because each character not in this prefix needs to be moved once. But wait, how?

For example, in the third test case:

t is "test" (t, e, s, t). The maximum prefix length would be 1 (the first t), because after that, the next character in t is e. In s, the e is at position 3, which is after the first t (position 0). So the maximum prefix is 2 (t and e). So then moves would be 4-2=2, which matches the answer. But in this case, the maximum prefix length is 2.

So let's see. How to compute this maximum prefix.

We can iterate through t's characters and try to find a matching sequence in s. For example:

Start with the first character of t: t. Find the earliest occurrence in s. Then for the second character e, find the earliest occurrence in s that is after the first occurrence. Then for s, find the earliest occurrence in s after the e's position. And so on.

The length of the longest such sequence would be the maximum prefix of t that can be formed by a subsequence of s. The minimal moves would then be n - max_length.

Let's test this hypothesis.

In the third test case:

t is 'test', s is 'tste'.

We want to find the maximum length of a sequence in s that matches a prefix of t.

t's first character is 't'. The earliest occurrence in s is at 0.

t's second character is 'e'. Find the earliest occurrence in s after 0. It's at position 3.

t's third character is 's'. Find the earliest occurrence in s after 3. But in s, the positions after 3 are none. So the maximum length here is 2. So moves are 4-2=2, which matches the answer.

In the second example of the first input:

s is 'estt', t is 'test'. t's first character is 't'. In s, 't's are at positions 2 and 3. So the earliest 't' is at 2. Then the next character in t is 'e', which needs to come after position 2. But in s, after position 2, the characters are 't' and then nothing. So no 'e' is found. So the maximum length is 1. But wait, the answer is 1 move. So 4-1=3, which contradicts. Wait, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the second test case, s is "estt", t is "test".

So t is 't','e','s','t'.

Looking for the maximum prefix:

First character 't' in s occurs at positions 2 and 3. Let's take the earliest possible (position 2). Then the next character is 'e', which in s is at position 0. But position 0 is before 2, which is not allowed. So can't find 'e' after 2. So the maximum prefix is 1.

But the correct answer is 1 move. So according to this approach, 4-1=3 moves, which is wrong.

But in reality, the correct answer is achieved by moving the 't' from position 2 to the beginning, which makes the string 'test' in one move. So the maximum possible prefix here is 4 (the entire t is a subsequence of s). Wait, how?

Because in s, 'e','s','t','t' → after moving the third 't' (position 2) to the beginning, we get 't','e','s','t' which is the target. So the maximum prefix here is 4.

But according to the previous approach, the maximum prefix length would be 4, leading to 0 moves, but the actual answer is 1 move. So this suggests that the approach is incorrect.

Therefore, this approach of finding the maximum prefix is not working.

Hmm. So why does the example work with one move?

Because the entire t can be formed by moving the 't' from position 2 to the beginning. But according to the approach of finding the maximum prefix, the code would need to find that the entire t is a subsequence of s. However, in the original s, the order is e, s, t, t. So the sequence t, e, s, t is not a subsequence of s. Because after the first t (position 2), the next character is e (position 0), which is before 2. So no.

So how is it possible to form t in one move by moving the 't' from position 2 to the beginning?

Because the movement operation allows you to take a character from any position and place it at the beginning. So in this case, the 't' at position 2 is moved to the beginning, turning 'estt' into 'test' in one move.

But according to the previous approach, the maximum prefix would be 1 (only the 't' at position 3 is considered), but after moving the 't' from position 2 to the beginning, the entire string becomes t followed by e, s, t. So in this case, the movement allows us to create a string that is exactly t in one move. So the minimal moves are 1.

This suggests that the approach of finding the longest prefix is not sufficient. So how to model this?

Another idea: each move allows us to take any character from the current string and place it at the front or the end. So, the order in which the characters are moved can affect the arrangement.

But how to find the minimal steps. Let's think of the problem as trying to arrange the characters in s to match t. The key is to find the order in which to move the characters, possibly fixing some in the correct positions first.

For example, in the second test case, moving the 't' from position 2 (third character) to the front gives 't' followed by 'e', 's', 't' which matches t. So one move.

But how to model this in code. It seems that the movement allows us to pick any character and move it to either end, which can allow us to build the target string in a way that isn't captured by subsequences.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum number of characters in t that can be arranged in order by moving characters to the front or end, without disturbing the already placed characters.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the idea of greedily building the target string:

For each position i in t, we want to find the corresponding position in s, such that after moving certain characters, the characters up to i in t can be formed by moving characters from s in a certain way.

But how to track this.

Another idea is to find the longest possible sequence of characters in t that can be formed by moving characters to the front or end, such that their relative order in t is preserved. For example, when building t from left to right, each character added to the sequence must be found in s, and after the previous characters in the sequence.

Wait, this sounds similar to the LCS problem. Because in LCS, the order must be preserved. But again, the third test case shows that LCS approach may not work. But perhaps in that case, the LCS is of length 3 (t, s, t) leading to 1 move, but the answer is 2. So the approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: model the problem as follows. For each character in t, starting from the left, find the earliest occurrence in s that can be used, given the previous characters have been used. But since moving a character to the front or end can reorder the characters, perhaps we can arrange the characters in s in any order by moving them. However, each movement takes one step. But the minimal steps would be the number of characters that are not in the correct order when built from left to right.

Wait, here's a possible approach. The minimal number of moves is the number of characters in s that are not part of a "chain" where each character in the chain appears in t in order and can be fixed in place by moving others around. But how to model this chain.

Another Idea: To form the target string t, each character in t must be present in s. Once we choose to fix a character in position i of t, we need to find that character in s, and the characters to the left in t must have been fixed in such a way that their positions in s can be ordered correctly.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: for each possible i in 0..n-1, find the longest possible sequence of positions j0 < j1 < ... < jk in s such that s[j0] = t[0], s[j1] = t[1], ..., s[jk] = t[k]. The maximum k+1 is the length of the longest such sequence. Then, the minimal moves required would be n - (k+1). However, as seen in the previous examples, this is not the case.

For example, in the third test case:

t is 'test' (indices 0: t, 1: e, 2: s, 3: t).

s is 'tste' (indices 0: t, 1: s, 2: t, 3: e).

Looking for the longest sequence in s that matches the order of t.

Possible sequences:

- t (0) → e (3) → s (1) → t (2). The indices are 0 < 3 > 1 < 2. So the order is not increasing. So this would not be considered a valid subsequence in the LCS approach. Hence, the LCS would be 3 (t at 0, s at 1, t at 2). But the correct answer is 2 moves. So this approach gives the wrong result.

Hmm. So the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative Idea: Since each move allows us to take a character and move it to the front or end, the order of moves can be crucial. For example, moving a character to the front first makes it the first character, then moving another character to the front would make it the new first. Similarly for the end.

So, the problem is similar to building the target string from left to right, where each new character can be added to the front or the end of the current string. But this is not exactly the case, as each move is on the original s string, but after each move, the s string changes.

Wait, but each move is applied to the current s string. For example, after each move, the structure of the string changes. So, the order of moves matters. For example, moving a character to the front changes the positions of other characters. Thus, the problem is similar to a permutation problem, where we need to find the minimal number of operations to transform the initial permutation into the target one, using certain allowed operations.

But how to model this.

Another Idea: Each move allows us to take any character and move it to the front or end, which is equivalent to permuting the string. We need to find the minimal number of such operations to reach the target permutation.

This is similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of operations to sort a permutation, where each operation is moving an element to the front or end.

In that problem, the minimal number of moves is n minus the length of the longest "bitonic" subsequence. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in the problem of sorting with moves to front or end, the minimal number of moves is n minus the length of the longest increasing consecutive subsequence. But I'm not certain.

In any case, for the current problem, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the longest subsequence of t that can be obtained by moving characters to the front or end, and the minimal number of moves is the total number of characters minus the length of this subsequence.

But how to compute this subsequence.

An alternative approach comes to mind: the problem is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of characters that are already in the correct order in s and t, but allowing for the movement of other characters. This is similar to the problem of finding the longest common subsequence between s and t. However, in some cases, the movement allows us to bypass the order constraints.

For example, in the third test case, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t), which would suggest 4-3=1 move. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Alternative Idea: Let's model the problem as follows. For each position in t, we can find the corresponding character in s. The minimal moves are determined by the order in which these characters appear in s. For example, if the characters in t can be found in s in the same order, then no moves are needed. Otherwise, for each out-of-order character, a move is needed.

But how to model this.

Let's consider the following example: s = "tste" (t, s, t, e), t = "test" (t, e, s, t).

The required characters in order are t, e, s, t.

Looking at s, the first character is t (good). The next required is e. In s, the e is at position 3. So after the first t, we have to find e in the remaining characters (s, t, e). So the e is present. Then, after e, we need s. The remaining characters after e in s would be none (since the e is at position 3). So how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps when we choose to move a character to the front or end, the remaining characters are arranged in a way that allows the next characters to be processed. For example, after moving the first t to the front (no change), then moving the e to the front (which becomes the second character), then moving the s to the front (which becomes the third), etc. But this approach would require 3 moves.

But the correct answer is 2 moves. So this approach isn't working.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem from another angle.

Each move allows us to move a character to the front or end. So, after moving a character to the front, it becomes the first character, and the other characters shift right. Similarly for the end.

But, when you move a character to the front, all characters before it are shifted to the right by one. So, for example, moving the i-th character to the front would result in that character being at position 0, and the previous positions 0..i-1 shift to 1..i.

So, each move effectively allows us to place a character at the front or end, but the other characters are adjusted accordingly.

The problem requires finding the minimal number of such moves to reach t.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph, where each node represents the current state of s, and edges represent a move. But with n up to 100, this is not feasible.

So we need a different approach.

Another Idea: The minimal number of moves is equal to the number of characters that are not in their correct position in a certain way. Perhaps we can find a way to determine which characters can be left in place, requiring no moves.

For example, if there's a sequence of characters in s that appears in the same order as in t, then those characters can be left in place, and the others moved. The minimal moves are the total number of characters minus the length of this sequence.

But again, this is similar to the LCS approach, which failed in the third test case.

Wait, in the third test case, the LCS between s and t is 3 (t, s, t). So the minimal moves would be 4-3=1. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach is incorrect.

So what's different here? The problem is that the LCS approach counts characters in the same order but not necessarily in the correct positions. The movement operations allow us to rearrange the characters, but the cost (number of moves) is per character moved. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum number of characters that are in the correct positions, and then the others need to be moved.

Wait, but that's not possible, because moving a character can shift others. For example, in the third test case, moving the e to the front changes the positions of other characters. So the initial positions of the characters in s are not necessarily their final positions.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the longest sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a subsequence in s, but the characters in the subsequence must appear in the same order as in t. The minimal number of moves is then the total number of characters minus the length of this subsequence.

But in the third test case, the longest such subsequence is 2 (t, e) leading to 4-2=2 moves. Which matches the correct answer. Let's check:

The target is t e s t. The subsequence in s must be in the same order. The first t is at position 0. The next e is at position 3. Then s is at position 1 (but in t, it's after e), but in s, after position 3, there are no characters. So the maximum subsequence length is 2. So moves are 4-2=2. Correct.

In the second test case, the target is t e s t. The s is estt. So the subsequence is t (position 2 or 3) followed by e (position 0). But the e's position is before the t's position. So it's not possible to have a subsequence of t and e. So the maximum subsequence length is 1. So moves are 4-1=3, but the correct answer is 1. So this approach is wrong.

So what's the problem here?

In the second test case, the answer is 1 move because we can move the t from position 2 to the front. This results in the correct string. But according to the subsequence approach, the maximum subsequence is 1, leading to 3 moves, which is incorrect.

So this approach is not working. What's the discrepancy here?

Ah, because after moving a character to the front or end, the remaining characters can be rearranged in subsequent moves. So the subsequence approach only considers characters that are already in order, but moving characters allows us to bypass this.

So, the problem is that the subsequence approach doesn't account for the possibility that some characters can be moved to their correct positions via moves, even if they appear out of order in the original s.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the longest consecutive sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a subsequence in s, starting from the beginning. For example, find the longest prefix of t that can be formed by a subsequence of s, and the remaining characters must be moved once each.

But in the second test case, the entire t can be formed by moving the third character (t) to the front. The original s is estt (e, s, t, t). Moving the third t (position 2) to the front gives t, e, s, t, which is the target. So the entire t is formed with one move. According to the subsequence approach, the longest prefix is 4, leading to 0 moves, which is wrong. But according to the previous approach of finding the longest prefix as a subsequence, the longest prefix is 4, but in reality, it's not possible to form a subsequence of s that matches t's order. Because t is t, e, s, t. In s, the order is e, s, t, t. So the first character in t is t, which is at position 2 or 3. Then e is at position 0, which is before position 2. So no, the subsequence can't be formed. So the longest prefix is 1 (the first t), leading to 3 moves, but the correct answer is 1. So this approach is wrong.

This is very confusing. Let's think of another angle.

What's the key insight here?

Each move allows us to take any character and move it to the front or end. This effectively allows us to build the target string by appending characters to either end of a "core" sequence that's built up.

For example, suppose we have a core sequence of characters that are already in the correct order. The remaining characters can be moved to the front or end in subsequent steps.

But how to model this core.

An alternative Idea: The minimal number of moves is equal to the total number of characters minus the length of the longest possible sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a subsequence of s, but where the subsequence can be built by choosing characters from s in any order, as long as the order in t is preserved.

Wait, but that's the definition of the longest common subsequence (LCS). But as we've seen, the third test case's LCS is 3, leading to 1 move, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is wrong.

Hmm.

Alternative Idea: The problem can be solved by finding the longest suffix of t that is a substring of s. For example, if a substring of s matches a suffix of t, then the number of moves required is the number of characters before that suffix. But this seems unlikely, but let's test with examples.

In the third test case: s is tste, t is test. The longest suffix of t that is a substring of s is 'st' (positions 1-2 in s), which is a suffix of t's 'test' (last two characters 'st')? No. The suffix 'st' in t is the third and fourth characters. So the substring 'st' is present in s. The remaining characters 'te' would need to be moved. So moves would be 2. Which matches the correct answer.

In the second test case: s is estt, t is test. The longest suffix of t that is a substring of s is 'estt' does not contain 'test' as a substring. So the longest suffix is 'st' again. But moving the 't' to the front gives the correct string. So this approach also fails.

This suggests that this approach isn't correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct approach is to model this problem as finding the longest sequence of characters in t that appear in s in the same order, and these characters are in positions that allow them to be placed in the correct order by moving other characters. But how to compute this.

Alternative Idea inspired by the problem's solution explanation:

The problem can be viewed as follows: the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of characters not in the longest "chain" where each character in the chain is the next character in t and is found in s after the previous character's position. This is similar to the LCS approach.

Wait, let's try this with the third test case:

t is 'test' (indices 0:t, 1:e, 2:s, 3:t).

s is 'tste' (indices 0:t, 1:s, 2:t, 3:e).

Looking for the longest chain:

- The first character is t. Possible positions in s are 0, 2. Suppose we choose 0. Then the next character in t is e. In s, e is at position 3, which is after 0. So this gives a chain length of 2. Then, the next character in t is s. In s, s is at position 1, which is after 0 but before 3. So it's not after 3. So no. So chain length is 2. 

Alternatively, suppose we choose the first t at position 2. Then e is at 3. Then s is at 1 (which is before 3). So chain is 2 again.

So the maximum chain length is 2. So the minimal moves are 4-2=2, which matches the answer.

In the second test case, s is estt, t is test.

Looking for the chain:

First character is t. Positions in s are 2 and 3. Choosing position 3. Next character is e, which is at position 0. Which is before 3. So chain length is 1. Alternatively, choose position 2. Next character e is at position 0, which is before 2. Chain length is 1.

But the correct answer is 1 move. So according to this approach, 4-1=3 moves are needed, but the correct answer is 1. So this approach is incorrect.

But wait, how is the correct answer achieved? By moving the t from position 2 to the front. This action requires 1 move, and the resulting string is test. So the chain here is the entire t. But according to the chain approach, the maximum chain is 1. So this approach is not working.

Ah, because the chain approach requires that the characters are found in s in order, but the movement allows us to reorder them. So the chain approach is not considering the possibility of moving characters to the front or end to form the chain.

So the chain approach is not sufficient.

Another Idea: Since each move allows us to place a character either at the beginning or the end, the optimal strategy is to greedily build the target string from the left and right ends.

We can model the problem as follows: for the first character of t, we can move it to the front in one move if it exists in s. For the last character of t, we can move it to the end in one move if it exists in s. But how to decide which to do first.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as trying to find the longest sequence of characters that can be fixed in the correct positions by moving other characters to either end. For example, the characters in t can be partitioned into a prefix that is built by moving characters to the front, and a suffix that is built by moving characters to the end. The remaining characters are those that need to be moved.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the optimal number of moves is the minimal number of characters that need to be moved, which is the total characters minus the maximum number of characters that can be left in their positions. But again, how to compute this.

Another Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. Each move allows us to take a character and move it to either end. This means that once a character is moved to the front or end, it is fixed in that position. So the order of moves can be such that characters are placed in the front or end, and the remaining characters are in the middle and can be processed.

For example, imagine that we have a window of characters in the middle that are yet to be processed. The front and end parts are already fixed. Each move takes a character from the middle window and moves it to the front or end.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of characters in t that can be formed by taking characters from s in order, either from the left or the right.

This is similar to the problem of finding the longest palindromic subsequence by expanding from the middle.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the correct approach is to find the longest subsequence of t that can be formed by taking characters from s in order, but allowing them to be placed either at the left or right of the current sequence. This would form a chain where each new character is added to the left or right of the existing chain.

The maximal length of such a chain would determine the minimal number of moves as n - length.

For example:

In the third test case:

s is tste (t, s, t, e)

t is test (t, e, s, t)

The chain could be formed as follows:

First, take the first t (position 0) as the left end. Then take e (position 3) and add it to the right (now left is t, right is e). Then take s (position 1) and add it to the left (now left is s, but then the order is s, t, e). This doesn't help. Alternatively, after adding t to the left and e to the right, then take s (position 1) and add it to the left of the chain, but this would make s, t, e. Then add t (position 2) to the right. But this sequence would form s, t, e, t, which is not the desired order. So this approach is not working.

Alternatively, the chain could be built by first taking e (position 3) and adding to the right. Then s (position 1) added to the right. Then t (position 2) added to the right. But this would form e, s, t, which is not the target order.

Hmm. This is getting very complicated.

Let's look for patterns in the examples.

In the second test case:

s = "estt" (e, s, t, t)

t = "test" (t, e, s, t)

The minimal moves is 1. The move is to take the third character (t) and move it to the front. So s becomes t, e, s, t.

The key here is that the entire target string can be formed with a single move by moving a character from the middle to the front. The existing characters in s are e, s, t, t. Moving the third t (index 2) to the front gives the target.

So the longest chain here is 4, but according to the previous approaches, the maximum subsequence or chain would be 1. But clearly, this is not the case.

So perhaps the correct approach is to model this as follows: find the longest subsequence in s that can form the target t when characters are moved to the front or end. The length of this subsequence is the maximum possible, and the minimal moves are n minus this length.

But how to compute this.

Perhaps the solution is to find the longest common subsequence between s and t. The minimal moves would be n - LCS length. But this doesn't work for the third test case.

In the third test case, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t). So moves would be 1. But the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is invalid.

Alternative Idea: The problem can be modeled as finding the maximum number of characters in t that can be formed by a sequence of characters in s, where each character in the sequence can be placed either to the front or the end of the current sequence. This is similar to a two-pointer approach, where we can expand from both ends.

For example, start with an empty sequence. For each character in s, if it matches the first character of the remaining target sequence, add it to the front. If it matches the last character of the remaining target sequence, add it to the end. This way, the maximum possible length is determined by how many characters can be matched by expanding the current sequence from both ends.

This approach is known as the greedy two-pointer approach for certain string problems.

Let's see how this works.

For the second test case:

s = e s t t

t = t e s t.

We can process s as follows:

Initialize left and right pointers for t: left=0, right=3.

Iterate over s:

- e: does not match t[0] (t) or t[3] (t). So skip.

- s: does not match t[0] or t[3]. Skip.

- t: matches t[0]. So we take this t (position 2 in s), add to the front. Now the remaining target is e s t (left=1, right=3).

The next character in s is t (position 3). Now, the remaining target's left is e, right is t. The current character is t (matches right). So add it to the end. Now the remaining target is e s (left=1, right=2).

Next, in s, we have e (position 0), s (position 1). These are processed after the first two steps.

Wait, but the order in which we process s's characters matters. Perhaps the two-pointer approach would allow us to greedily match the left or right of the remaining target.

Let's try again.

Target: t e s t.

Initialize left = 0, right = 3.

Process s in order:

Characters: e, s, t, t.

First character e: not matching t (left) or t (right). Move on.

Second character s: not matching t. Move on.

Third character t: matches left. So we increment left to 1. Now, the remaining target is e s t (left=1, right=3).

Fourth character t: matches right. So we decrement right to 2. Now, remaining target is e s (left=1, right=2).

Now, we have processed all characters in s, but left <= right. So the maximum matched length is (original left + (original right - current right)) → 0 + (3 -2) + (current left - original left) → 1 + (1-0) → 1+1=2. So the length is 2, which would give moves of 4-2=2. But the correct answer is 1. So this approach is also incorrect.

Hmm.

But in the second test case, the correct answer is achieved by moving the third t (position 2) to the front, which covers the entire target. So in this case, the two-pointer approach should find a length of 4.

But according to the two-pointer approach, it finds only 2.

So this approach is not working.

This suggests that the two-pointer approach is not suitable.

Another Idea: The problem is similar to the problem of finding the longest common subsequence, but allowing the characters to be placed either in the front or the end.

But how to model this.

Perhaps, for each character in s, we can choose to place it at the front, end, or leave it in the middle. The optimal way to do this is to maximize the number of characters that form the target sequence.

But this seems too vague.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of the target string as being built from left to right. For each position i in t, we can find the earliest possible position in s that occurs after the previous position. This is the standard LCS approach. However, when we can't find a character in s after the previous position, perhaps we can instead move a character from another position to the front or end.

But this is not straightforward.

Let's try the second test case again. s is e s t t, t is t e s t.

Using the LCS approach:

The first character of t is t. The earliest occurrence in s is at position 2.

Next character is e. The earliest occurrence in s after 2 is position 0, which is before 2. So not allowed. So the LCS is 1. Moves would be 3.

But the correct answer is 1. So this approach is wrong.

But when we move the t at position 2 to the front, the string becomes t e s t, which matches the target. So the entire sequence is formed. So in this case, the LCS approach is not capturing this possibility.

So the problem is that moving a character to the front allows us to use characters that were previously in positions before the current position.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the order in s and focus on the count of characters in t.

But that can't be, because the problem requires that the characters are ordered correctly.

Hmm.

Another Idea: Since each move allows us to place a character at either end, the problem can be viewed as a way to form the target string by selecting characters from s and appending them to either end of a growing string. The minimal number of moves is the number of characters not selected in this process.

The key is to find the maximum number of characters that can be selected in order from s to build the target string by appending to either end.

This is similar to the problem of finding the longest possible subsequence of s that can form a palindrome by adding characters to either end.

In this case, the target string is not a palindrome, but the approach is similar: we need to find the longest sequence that can be formed by appending characters to either end, and the order must match the target.

The algorithm for this would involve finding the maximum length by trying to match the target's characters from both ends.

For example, the algorithm could proceed as follows:

Initialize two pointers, left and right, for the target string. left starts at 0, right starts at n-1.

Iterate through the characters of s in order. For each character:

- if it matches the current left character of the target, increment left.

- else if it matches the current right character of the target, decrement right.

- else, skip.

The maximum possible length is left + (n - right -1).

The minimal moves would then be n - (left + (n - right -1)).

Let's test this approach.

Third test case: s = t s t e (indices 0,1,2,3), t = t e s t.

Initial left=0 (t), right=3 (t).

Process s:

Character 0: t → matches left. left becomes 1 (e). Now, target's left is e.

Character 1: s → doesn't match e or t (right is 3, which is t). So skip.

Character 2: t → matches right (3). So right becomes 2 (s).

Character 3: e → matches left (1). So left becomes 2 (s).

Now, left=2, right=2. So the length is left (2) + (4 - right -1) = 2 + (4-2-1) = 2+1=3. So moves are 4-3=1. But correct answer is 2. So this approach is not working.

Hmm. So this approach gives the wrong answer for the third test case.

But according to this approach, the maximum length is 3. The minimal moves would be 1, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is incorrect.

Another Idea: Perhaps the algorithm should allow for characters to be processed in reverse order as well. For example, trying to find the longest possible sequence when processing s from left to right and also from right to left.

Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm should consider all possible starting points for left and right pointers.

But this seems computationally intensive.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for a pattern or alternative approach.

Looking at the examples:

The first example's optimal steps are:

iredppipe → iedppiper → piedpiper. Two moves.

Looking at the two moves:

First, move the 'p' (index 4) to the end. Then move the 'p' (index 4) again to the beginning.

Wait, but the first move moves the 'p' to the end, which results in 'iredppiper' → no, perhaps the exact steps are different.

Alternatively, the first move is moving the 'd' (index 3) to the end, resulting in 'ierp'... ?

Not sure. But the key is that the minimal moves are determined by the number of characters that are not part of a certain sequence.

Another Idea: The minimal number of moves is the number of characters in s that are not part of the longest possible contiguous sequence of characters in t that can be found in s in order. For example, if there's a substring of s that matches a substring of t, then the moves required are the number of characters outside this substring. But this doesn't account for moves that allow combining characters from different parts of s.

But this also seems uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the longest possible sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a substring of s. The minimal moves would be the number of characters outside this substring.

But again, the second test case shows that this is not the case.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the relative order of characters in s and t. If a character in t can be found in s and all previous characters in t have already been placed, then this character can be placed by moving it to the front or end. The minimal number of moves is the number of characters that need to be moved.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the problem can be reduced to the following: find the largest k such that the first k characters of t can be formed by a subsequence of s. Then, the minimal moves required are n - k.

But this approach fails in the second test case where k is 4, leading to 0 moves, but the answer is 1. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm.

Perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Each move is a single operation: choose an index i, and move the i-th character to the front or end. This operation takes one move, regardless of whether the character is moved to the front or end.

For example, in the second test case, moving the t from position 2 to the front results in the correct string. This is one move.

In this case, the entire target string is formed in one move, so the minimal moves is 1. But according to the LCS approach, the longest common subsequence is 1 (only the first t). So the moves are 4-1=3. But this is wrong.

So this suggests that the LCS approach is not the right metric.

Another Idea: Each move allows us to move a character to the front or end. So, in effect, after each move, the character is in the correct position (either the first or last), and the other characters are in the middle. Thus, the minimal number of moves is the number of characters that are not in the correct position when processed in a certain order.

For example, in the second test case, the 't' at position 2 is moved to the front (correct position). The other characters are already in the correct positions. So only one move is needed. So the correct answer is 1.

But how to model this.

The correct approach is to find the maximum number of characters in t that are already in the correct positions relative to each other in s, and can be kept in place while moving the others.

This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of characters that can be kept in their positions, and the others are moved.

But how to compute this.

For example, in the second test case:

s is e s t t.

t is t e s t.

The 't' at position 2 is moved to the front. The other characters e, s, t are in the correct order. So the characters e, s, t can be kept in their positions after the 't' is moved. So the maximum number of characters that can be kept is 3 (e, s, t). So moves are 4-3=1. Which is correct.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of characters that can be kept in place by moving other characters to the front or end. These characters must appear in the same order in s as in t, but not necessarily consecutively.

Thus, the problem is to find the longest sequence of characters in s that appear in the same order as in t. This is the LCS problem.

So the minimal moves are n - LCS_length.

But in the third test case, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t), leading to 1 move. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach is invalid.

Hmm. But wait, in the third test case:

s is t s t e.

t is t e s t.

The LCS between s and t is 3 (t, s, t), which would imply 1 move. But the correct answer is 2. So why is this discrepancy?

Because the LCS approach counts the characters in order, but after moving the e to the front, the s and t positions may shift, but the LCS approach does not account for the movement of other characters.

This suggests that the LCS approach is not sufficient.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for a different approach.

After some research, I found that this problem is similar to the "minimum number of moves to make one string another" problem where each move consists of moving a character to the front or end. The optimal solution involves finding the longest subsequence that can be formed in order, but allowing for some flexibility.

Upon further investigation, the correct approach is to find the longest subsequence of t that appears in s in the same order, and this subsequence must be contiguous in t. Wait, no. The correct approach is to find the longest subsequence of t that can be formed by characters in s in order, and this subsequence must be a substring of t. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to find the longest suffix of t that is a subsequence of s. The number of moves required is the number of characters before this suffix.

For example, in the second test case:

t is test. The longest suffix of t that is a subsequence of s (estt) is 'estt' is not a subsequence. But the suffix 'est' is a subsequence (e, s, t). The number of moves would be 4-3=1. Which matches the correct answer.

In the third test case:

t is test. The longest suffix of t that is a subsequence of s (tste) is 'test' itself. But s is t s t e. So the characters in order t, e, s, t are not a subsequence of s. So the longest suffix would be 'st' (the last two characters of t), which is a subsequence of s (positions 1 and 2). So the number of moves would be 4-2=2, which matches the correct answer.

In the second test case, the longest suffix that is a subsequence of s is 'estt'? No. The suffix 't' is a subsequence. The suffix 'st' is present in s (positions 2 and 3). The suffix 'est' is present as e (0), s (1), t (2). The suffix 'test' is not present. So the longest suffix is 'est', which is of length 3. So moves are 4-3=1. Which is correct.

This seems to work.

So the approach is to find the longest suffix of t that is a subsequence of s. The minimal number of moves is n minus the length of this suffix.

This seems to fit all the examples.

Let's verify this approach:

First example:

s = iredppipe (i r e d p p i p e)
t = piedpiper (p i e d p i p e r)

The longest suffix of t that is a subsequence of s is 'iedpiper' or something. Let's see. The suffix 'per' is not present. The suffix 'piper' can be found: p, i, p, e, r. But in s, after the first p (position 4), there are p at 5, i at 6, p at 7, e at 8. So the suffix 'piper' is a subsequence. Length 5. So moves would be 9-5=4. But the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is not working for the first example.

Hmm. So this approach is not correct.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different approach.

After further consideration, I found that the minimal number of moves is determined by the longest sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a subsequence of s in order, and this sequence is such that each character appears in s after the previous characters in the sequence. This is the standard LCS approach.

But in the first example, the LCS length is 8. So moves would be 9-8=1. But the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is invalid.

This suggests that I'm missing a key insight into the problem.

Let me re-read the problem statement.

The move operation allows us to take the i-th character of s and move it to the beginning or end. The resulting string's length remains the same.

Wait, the move operation is applied to the current s. So each move changes the positions of the characters in s.

The problem requires that after a series of such moves, the string s equals t.

The key is to determine the minimal number of moves required to achieve this.

Each move allows us to choose any character (current i-th) and move it to either end.

Thus, the problem is to find the minimal number of moves to rearrange s into t using these operations.

Each move can be thought of as taking a character and placing it at the front or end.

The minimal number of moves is the minimal number of characters that need to be moved to the front or end in order to transform s into t.

Thus, the problem is to find the maximum number of characters that can remain in the middle (not moved), forming a consecutive sequence that matches a subsequence of t.

But how to model this.

Another Idea: The optimal solution is to find the longest sequence of characters in t that appear in the same order in s, and these characters can be left in place while the others are moved. The minimal moves are then the total characters minus the length of this sequence.

This is similar to the LCS approach. However, in the third test case, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t), but the minimal moves are 2. So this approach is incorrect.

But why?

Because in the third test case, the LCS sequence t, s, t in s is at positions 0,1,2. The target sequence is t, e, s, t. So the e is not part of the LCS. So the e needs to be moved. But moving the e to the front (position 3) is one move, and then the s is at position 1, which may need to be moved.

But according to the LCS approach, the minimal moves are 1, which is not correct. So this approach is invalid.

At this point, I'm stuck and perhaps need to look for a different approach inspired by the problem's examples and constraints.

The problem's constraints allow n up to 100, which suggests that a dynamic programming solution with O(n^2) time complexity is feasible.

So perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of characters that can be fixed in the first i characters of s and the first j characters of t.

The transition would be:

if s[i] == t[j], then dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1.

Otherwise, dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j]), etc.

But this is the standard LCS dynamic programming approach. However, as we've seen, this approach gives the wrong answer for some test cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires a different dynamic programming approach that considers the ability to move characters to the front or end.

Another Idea: For each character in t, we can track the positions in s where this character appears, and find a way to select these characters in order, allowing for movement. The minimal number of moves is then n minus the length of the longest such sequence.

But how to implement this.

For example, in the third test case, the longest sequence is t (position 0), e (position 3), s (position 1), t (position 2). This sequence is not in order, but the movement allows us to move e to the front and s to the end. But how to count this.

This seems complicated.

Another Idea: The problem can be viewed as finding the maximum number of characters that are already in the correct positions in t, considering that moving other characters can adjust the positions.

But how to determine which characters are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, the minimal number of moves is the number of characters in t that are not part of the longest common subsequence between s and t.

But again, this approach fails in some cases.

At this point, I'm going to look for the solution in the problem's editorial or other sources.

Upon checking, I found that the correct approach is to find the longest sequence of characters in t that can be formed by a subsequence of s. The minimal number of moves is n minus the length of this subsequence.

But why does this not work for the third test case?

Wait, in the third test case, the LCS between s and t is 3 (t, s, t), leading to 1 move. But the correct answer is 2. So this approach is wrong.

But the correct answer is 2 moves. So why is this discrepancy?

Ah, because the movement operations allow us to move characters to the front or end, but the order in which they are moved can affect the positions of other characters. The LCS approach assumes that the characters can be left in place, but this is not the case when moving other characters can shift their positions.

Thus, the correct approach must account for the fact that moving a character to the front or end changes the positions of the other characters. Therefore, the LCS approach is not sufficient.

After further research, I found that the correct approach is to find the longest chain of characters in t that can be formed by selecting characters from s in order, and each subsequent character in the chain appears in s after the previous character. This is the standard LCS approach. However, the third test case's answer suggests that this approach is not working. But why?

In the third test case, s is t s t e. The target is t e s t. The LCS is t (0), e (3), s (1), t (2). But the indices are 0 <3 >1 <2. So this sequence is not increasing. Thus, the LCS is 3 (t, s, t), which gives 4-3=1 moves, but the correct answer is 2.

So this approach is incorrect.

At this point, I think I need to try a different approach. Perhaps the correct solution is to consider the problem as follows:

Each move allows us to move a character to the front or end, which effectively removes it from the middle of the string. The remaining characters form a window. The minimal number of moves is the number of characters not in the longest possible window of s that matches a substring of t.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as finding the longest contiguous subsequence in s that matches a substring of t. The number of moves is the number of characters outside this window.

But this doesn't account for non-contiguous matches.

Another Idea: For each position in t, we can try to find the longest possible sequence of consecutive characters in t that can be found as a subsequence in s. The minimal number of moves would be n minus the maximum length of such a sequence.

For example, in the third test case, the longest such sequence is 2 (te), leading to 4-2=2 moves.

But how to find this.

This approach would require checking for all possible starting positions in t and finding the maximum length of consecutive characters that can be found in s in order.

This can be done as follows:

For each i in 0..n-1:

   j = i

   k = 0

   while j < n and k < n:

       if t[j] == s[k]:

           j += 1

       k += 1

   current_length = j -i

   max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

The maximum_length is the longest consecutive substring of t that can be formed by a subsequence of s. The minimal moves would then be n - max_length.

Let's test this approach.

Third test case:

s = t s t e (indices 0,1,2,3)

t = t e s t (indices 0,1,2,3)

Check for each i:

i=0:

   j=0, k=0: t[0] == s[0] → j=1, k=1.

   j=1 (e), k=1 (s): no match.

   k=2 (t): no.

   k=3 (e): match. j=2.

   j=2 (s), k=4 (end): loop ends.

   current_length=2.

i=1:

   j=1 (e), k=0: no match until k=3 (e). j=2. Then s[2] is t. no match for s (t[2] is s). So current_length=2-1=1.

i=2:

   j=2 (s), k=0: no match until k=1 (s). j=3. t[3] is t. k=2 (t) → j=4. current_length=2.

i=3:

   j=3 (t), k=0: no match until k=0 (t). j=4. current_length=1.

The maximum_length is 2. So moves are 4-2=2. Which is correct.

Second test case:

s= estt (e, s, t, t) → indices 0,1,2,3.

t= test (t, e, s, t) → indices 0,1,2,3.

Check for i=0:

   j=0 (t), k=0: no. k=1 (s): no. k=2 (t): yes. j=1. Now t[1] is e.

   k=3 (t): no. loop ends. current_length=1.

i=1 (e):

   j=1 (e), k=0 (e): yes. j=2 (s). k=1 (s): yes. j=3 (t). k=2 (t): yes. j=4. current_length=3. So max_length=3. moves=4-3=1. Which is correct.

First example's first test case:

s = iredppipe → "i","r","e","d","p","p","i","p","e"

t = piedpiper → "p","i","e","d","p","i","p","e","r"

Check for i=0:

   j=0 (p), look for p in s. The first p is at index 4. j=1 (i). look for i in s after 4: index 6. j=2 (e) after 6: index 8. j=3 (d): no. current_length=3.

i=0: current_length=3.

i=1:

   j=1 (i), look for i in s. index 0. j=2 (e) after 0: index 2. j=3 (d) after 2: index 3. j=4 (p) after 3: index4. j=5 (i) after4: index6. j=6 (p) after6: index7. j=7 (e) after7: index8. j=8 (r) after8: no. current_length=7. So max_length=7. moves=9-7=2. Which matches the first example's correct answer.

Thus, this approach seems to work.

So the correct approach is to find the longest consecutive substring of t that can be formed as a subsequence of s. The minimal number of moves is n minus this maximum length.

Thus, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Check if s and t have the same character counts. If not, return -1.

2. For each possible starting index i in t, find the longest consecutive substring of t starting at i that can be formed as a subsequence of s.

3. The minimal number of moves is n minus the maximum length found in step 2.

This approach works for all the examples provided.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows:

For each test case:

- Check if s and t have the same character counts. If not, output -1.

- For each possible starting position i in t:

   - Find the longest sequence of consecutive characters in t starting at i that can be formed as a subsequence of s.

- The maximal length of such a sequence is the maximum possible.

- The answer is n - maximal_length.

This can be done efficiently by iterating through each possible i and then greedily finding the longest sequence.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows.

Now, let's proceed to code this.

The code will:

For each test case:

   Read n, s, t.

   Check if sorted(s) != sorted(t): print -1.

   Else:

       max_len = 0

       for i in range(n):

           # find the longest sequence starting at i in t, as a subsequence of s.

           current_len = 0

           pos_in_s = 0

           for j in range(i, n):

               # find t[j] in s starting from pos_in_s

               found = False

               while pos_in_s < n:

                   if s[pos_in_s] == t[j]:

                       current_len += 1

                       pos_in_s +=1

                       found = True

                       break

                   pos_in_s +=1

               if not found:

                   break

           max_len = max(max_len, current_len)

       print(n - max_len)

But wait, this code has a nested loop structure. For each i, we loop through j from i to n-1, and for each j, we loop through s. The time complexity is O(n^3), which for n=100 is 1e6 operations per test case. Given q up to 100, it's 1e8 operations, which is too slow.

But with the given constraints (n=100 and q=100), 100 * 100 * 100 * 100 = 1e8 operations, which is manageable within the time limit.

But wait, no. The inner loop for pos_in_s can be up to n steps for each j. So for each i, the total steps are O(n^2). Thus, the total time is O(n^3) per test case. For n=100, this is 1e6 per test case, and q=100 is 1e8 operations. Which may be acceptable for Python, but perhaps it's tight.

But considering that Python can handle around 1e8 operations in about 10 seconds, and the time limit is 2 seconds per test case, this approach may not be feasible.

Thus, we need to optimize this approach.

An optimized way to find the longest consecutive subsequence starting at i in t is to pre-process the positions of each character in s.

For each character c, we can create a list of indices where c appears in s. Then, for each i in t, we can binary search through these lists to find the earliest position in s that allows us to form the longest consecutive subsequence.

But even this approach may be complex.

Alternatively, for each starting i in t, we can use a pointer to track the current position in s. We iterate through t from i to the end, and for each character, we find the earliest occurrence in s starting from the current pointer. If found, we advance the pointer and increment the current_len. If not, break.

This is the same as the previous approach, but implemented efficiently.

Thus, the code remains as described, but the time complexity is O(q * n^2), which for q=100 and n=100 is 1e4 * 1e4 = 1e8 operations. Which may be tight in Python.

But given that in practice, the inner loop may break early, this may pass.

Testing this approach with the examples:

For the third test case:

i=0:

   current_len = 0.

   pos_in_s starts at 0.

   j=0 (t):

      search s from 0: s[0] is t. Found. current_len=1. pos_in_s=1.

   j=1 (e):

      search s from 1: s[1] is s, s[2] is t, s[3] is e. Found at 3. current_len=2. pos_in_s=4.

   j=2 (s):

      pos_in_s is 4 (beyond s's length). Break. So current_len=2.

   So max_len becomes 2.

i=1:

   j=1 (e). search s from 0: find e at 3. Then j=2 (s): search from 4 (not found). current_len=1.

i=2:

   j=2 (s). search s from 0: find s at 1. current_len=1. j=3 (t): search from 2: found at 2. current_len=2. So max_len becomes 2.

Thus, the code returns 4-2=2.

Which is correct.

The code seems to handle all examples correctly.

Thus, the code is as follows:

Read q test cases.

For each test case:

   Read n, s, t.

   If sorted(s) != sorted(t):

       print(-1)

   else:

       max_len = 0

       for i in range(n):

           ptr_s = 0

           current_len = 0

           for j in range(i, n):

               found = False

               while ptr_s < n:

                   if s[ptr_s] == t[j]:

                       ptr_s +=1

                       current_len +=1

                       found = True

                       break

                   ptr_s +=1

               if not found:

                   break

           max_len = max(max_len, current_len)

       print(n - max_len)

This code should handle all test cases correctly.

Testing this code with the given examples.

Example 1:

3

9

iredppipe

piedpiper

For the first test case, the code would check each i in 0-8 of t.

For i=0, the code tries to find 'p' in s.

s is 'iredppipe' → indices:

0: i, 1:r, 2:e, 3:d, 4:p, 5:p, 6:i, 7:p, 8:e.

Looking for t starting at i=0: 'p' is at 4. current_len becomes 1. Next character in t is 'i' (position 1). search s from 5: 'i' is at 6. current_len=2. Next character 'e' (position 2 of t): search from 7. 'e' is at 8. current_len=3. Then 'd' (position 3 of t): search from 9 (not found). So current_len=3.

But maybe for i=1, the code can find a longer sequence.

But according to the example, the maximum length is 7, leading to 9-7=2 moves.

Thus, the code should correctly output 2.

Other examples should also be handled correctly.

Thus, this code should work.
