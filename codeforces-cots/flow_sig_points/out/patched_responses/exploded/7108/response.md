Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of ways to split a rectangular field into three parts with two parallel lines. Each part must have exactly A, B, and C tons of corn. The lines can be either vertical or horizontal, and they need to be parallel. The key is to check all possible ways of splitting and count those that meet the criteria.

First, I need to understand the input and constraints. The maximum size for n and m is 50 each. Wait, but 50x50 is manageable. The time limit is 1 second, which suggests that any O(n^2) or O(m^2) solution might work, but I need to be careful with the approach.

Let's think about how to split the field. The two lines can be either vertical or horizontal. Let's consider both possibilities separately.

For vertical lines: We need two vertical cuts, which divide the field into three parts left, middle, right. Each of these parts must be a rectangle with sum equal to A, B, C (in any order). Similarly for horizontal lines: two cuts split into top, middle, bottom.

So, the approach could be:

1. Precompute the prefix sums for the grid in both possible directions (row-wise or column-wise, depending on the direction of the split).
2. For each possible direction (vertical or horizontal), generate all possible pairs of split positions and check if the three regions sum to A, B, C in any permutation.
3. Sum the valid splits from both directions.

But how to compute the sums efficiently?

Let's think about vertical splits. Suppose the grid has m columns. We need two vertical lines, say after column i and after column j (i < j). The three regions would be columns 0..i, i+1..j, j+1..m-1. Each of these must have a sum equal to A, B, C in some order.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the lines must be between squares. So, for vertical lines, the first split is between column x and x+1, and the second split is between column y and y+1, where x < y. Then the three parts would be columns 0..x, x+1..y, y+1..m-1. So the sum of each part is the sum of those columns.

Similarly for horizontal lines: splits after row x and row y, leading to three row ranges.

So the first step is to compute the sum for all possible vertical splits and horizontal splits.

But how do we compute the sum of a vertical slice (like columns from a to b) efficiently? The grid is 2D, so for vertical splits, each vertical slice is a set of columns. The sum of a vertical slice (columns a to b) would be the sum of all elements in those columns for all rows. Similarly, a horizontal slice is rows a to b, and sum is all elements in those rows, all columns.

So the plan is:

For vertical direction:

- Precompute the sum of each column. Then, the sum of columns from a to b is the sum of columns[a] to columns[b]. So we can precompute a prefix sum array of columns.

For horizontal direction:

- Precompute the sum of each row. Then, the sum of rows a to b is the sum of rows[a] to rows[b]. Again, a prefix sum array of rows.

Wait, but columns here are the sum of that column across all rows. For example, column 0's sum is the sum of grid[0][0], grid[1][0], ..., grid[n-1][0]. So if we have a vertical split between x and x+1, then the left part is columns 0 to x. The sum is the sum of all those columns. So each column's sum is precomputed, then the sum for a range of columns is the sum of their sums.

Similarly for rows: the sum of a horizontal split between x and x+1, then the top part is rows 0 to x. Sum is sum of row sums.

So first, for the vertical case:

Compute col_sums array where col_sums[i] is the sum of column i (sum all rows for that column). Then compute the prefix sum array of col_sums. Let's call it v_prefix. So v_prefix[i] is sum of col_sums[0..i-1]. Wait, maybe prefix sums where v_prefix[k] is the sum of the first k columns. So, for columns a to b inclusive, the sum is v_prefix[b+1] - v_prefix[a].

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose columns are 0-based. The sum from columns 0 to x (inclusive) is sum(col_sums[0] + ... + col_sums[x]). So the prefix array can be built as follows: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = col_sums[0], prefix[2] = col_sums[0]+col_sums[1], etc. So the sum from a to b (inclusive) is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].

Yes. So for vertical splits, the three regions would be:

sum1 = prefix[x+1] - prefix[0] (columns 0..x)
sum2 = prefix[y+1] - prefix[x+1] (columns x+1..y)
sum3 = prefix[m] - prefix[y+1] (columns y+1..m-1)

But x and y must be such that 0 <= x < y < m-1. Because the two splits must be between columns x and x+1, and between y and y+1. Also, after the splits, each part must have at least one column. So x must be >=0, y must be >=x+1, and y+1 <= m-1. So x can be from 0 to m-3, y can be from x+1 to m-2.

Wait, m is the number of columns. So the possible positions for vertical splits are between columns 0 and 1, 1 and 2, ..., m-2 and m-1. So there are m-1 possible vertical split positions. But we need two splits, so the positions are i and j (i < j). Each split must leave at least one column in each part. So the first split can't be at the last position, and the second split must be after the first.

Wait, for vertical splits:

The two split positions are i and j, where i < j. Each split is between two columns. The three parts are:

columns 0..i → sum is sum of columns 0 to i → which is prefix[i+1] - prefix[0] = prefix[i+1]

columns i+1 to j → sum is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i+1]

columns j+1 to m-1 → sum is prefix[m] - prefix[j+1]

Each of these parts must have at least one column. So:

0..i must have at least 1 column → i >=0, but i can be up to m-3? Because after i, there are j columns left. For example, if m=3, then possible i can be 0 (since j has to be at least 1, and j+1 can be 2). So:

i can range from 0 to m-2, but j must be at least i+1 and j can be up to m-2.

Wait, for example, m=5 columns. The possible split positions are between 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 (4 possible positions). Two splits: i and j. So for the three regions to each have at least one column, the first split i must be such that after splitting at i, the left part has i+1 columns (since columns 0 to i). Then the second split j must be after i+1 columns, but the remaining part (columns j+1 to m-1) must have at least one column. So j+1 <= m-1 - 1 → j+1 <= m-2 → j <= m-3. So j can be at most m-3.

Wait, let's see:

After splitting at j, the third part is columns j+1 to m-1. To have at least one column, j+1 <= m-1. Which is always true as j is <= m-2. So the third part has (m-1 - (j+1) + 1) = m - j -1 columns. For that to be >=1, j+1 <= m-1 → j <= m-2. But j has to be at least i+1, which is >=1.

So for vertical splits:

i ranges from 0 to m-3, and j ranges from i+1 to m-2. Because if m=3, i can be 0, j can be 1. Then third part is columns 2 to 2 (one column).

So the total possible splits for vertical direction is sum over i from 0 to m-3 of (m-2 - (i+1) +1) = m-2 -i -1 +1 = m-2 -i. So for each i, j can be from i+1 to m-2.

But how do we compute this? For vertical splits, iterate all possible i and j where i < j, and j <= m-2. Then check if the three sums (sum1, sum2, sum3) can form a permutation of A, B, C.

Similarly for horizontal splits: compute row sums, build prefix sum array, then iterate all possible i and j for splits between rows.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the row and column sums.

2. For both vertical and horizontal directions, generate all possible pairs of splits (i, j) and check if the three sums match A, B, C in any permutation.

3. Count the number of valid splits.

Now, the key is to compute the sum of the three regions quickly. Also, since the order of the regions (sum1, sum2, sum3) can be any permutation of A, B, C, we need to check if the multiset {sum1, sum2, sum3} equals {A, B, C}.

So for each split, compute the three sums, create a sorted list of them, and see if it matches the sorted list of [A, B, C].

Wait, but A, B, C could have duplicates, so the sorted list must match exactly. For example, if A=3, B=3, C=3, then the three sums must each be 3.

But the problem statement says that the three parts must have exactly A, B, and C. So the three sums must be exactly the three values, but the order doesn't matter.

So the approach is:

- Compute the three sums for a split.

- Check if the three sums, when sorted, equal the sorted list of A, B, C.

So, in code, for a split:

sums = sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3])

target = sorted([A, B, C])

if sums == target: count +=1

Now, how to compute the sum1, sum2, sum3 for each split direction.

First, let's compute the vertical splits.

Vertical splits:

Compute the column sums. Then compute the prefix sums. For each possible i and j:

sum1 = sum of columns 0..i → prefix[i+1] - prefix[0] = prefix[i+1]

sum2 = sum of columns i+1..j → prefix[j+1] - prefix[i+1]

sum3 = sum of columns j+1..m-1 → prefix[m] - prefix[j+1]

Wait, prefix is built as follows:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = col_sums[0]

prefix[2] = col_sums[0] + col_sums[1]

...

prefix[k] = sum of first (k-1) columns? Or maybe the prefix array is designed so that sum from a to b (inclusive) is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].

Yes. So for columns from a to b inclusive, sum is prefix[b+1] - prefix[a].

So for vertical splits:

sum1 is columns 0..i → a=0, b=i → sum is prefix[i+1] - prefix[0] = prefix[i+1]

sum2 is columns i+1..j → a = i+1, b = j → sum is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i+1]

sum3 is columns j+1..m-1 → a = j+1, b = m-1 → sum is prefix[m] - prefix[j+1]

Similarly for horizontal splits, the row sums:

sum_rows is the sum of each row. Then the prefix is row_prefix, where row_prefix[k] is the sum of the first k-1 rows. So sum from a to b rows (inclusive) is row_prefix[b+1] - row_prefix[a].

So for horizontal splits, sum1 is sum of rows 0..i, sum2 is rows i+1..j, sum3 is rows j+1..n-1.

So, for each possible direction (vertical and horizontal), compute all possible (i, j) pairs and check their sums.

Now, the code steps:

Read n and m.

Read the grid, n rows each with m elements.

Compute the row sums and column sums.

Compute the prefix sums for columns (vertical splits) and rows (horizontal splits).

Then, for vertical splits:

Loop i from 0 to m-3:

   loop j from i+1 to m-2:

      compute sum1, sum2, sum3 as per vertical prefix.

      check if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) equals sorted([A, B, C])

      if yes, increment count.

For horizontal splits:

Loop i from 0 to n-3:

   loop j from i+1 to n-2:

      compute sum1, sum2, sum3 as per row prefix.

      check if sorted equals target.

      if yes, increment count.

Sum the counts from vertical and horizontal splits.

Now, how to compute the row and column sums.

Row sums: for each row in the grid, sum all elements.

Column sums: for each column in the grid (each column is the elements grid[0][col], grid[1][col], ..., grid[n-1][col]), sum them.

So for column in 0 to m-1:

sum_col[column] = sum(grid[row][column] for row in 0..n-1)

Similarly for row sums.

Once we have the row and column sums, compute the prefix arrays.

For vertical direction:

v_prefix = [0]*(m+1)

for i in 0 to m-1:

   v_prefix[i+1] = v_prefix[i] + column_sums[i]

So the sum from columns a to b (inclusive) is v_prefix[b+1] - v_prefix[a].

Similarly for row_prefix.

So code:

After reading the grid:

row_sums = [sum(row) for row in grid]

column_sums = [sum(row[col] for row in grid) for col in range(m)]

Then compute the prefix sums.

Now, the time complexity.

For vertical splits:

The number of possible (i, j) pairs is O(m^2). Similarly for horizontal splits, O(n^2). Since m and n can be up to 50, m^2 is 2500, same for n. So total possible splits is 2500 + 2500 = 5000, which is manageable.

Each split requires computing three sums and checking sorted lists. All of this is O(1) per split. So overall time is acceptable.

Now, possible edge cases:

- When the total sum of the grid is not equal to A+B+C. But in that case, any split would not sum to the required, so the answer is zero.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the field is divided into three parts. So the sum of A, B, C must equal the total sum of the grid. So first, we can check if A+B+C equals the total sum, and if not, return zero. That's a crucial optimization.

Yes! Because if the sum of A, B, C is not equal to the total sum of the grid, there's no way to split, so the answer is zero.

So step zero: compute total_sum = sum of all elements. If total_sum != (A + B + C), then output 0.

Else, proceed.

This can save a lot of unnecessary processing.

So code:

total_sum = sum(row_sums)

if total_sum != (A + B + C):

   print(0)

   exit()

Else:

proceed to check splits.

This is an important check to avoid processing splits that can't possibly work.

Another edge case is when one of the parts has zero sum, but the problem allows A, B, C to be zero. However, each part must have at least one square. So even if the sum is zero, as long as the area is at least one square, it's allowed.

Wait, but the problem statement says that each part must consist of at least one square. So when checking splits, the parts must have at least one column (for vertical) or row (for horizontal).

But when we split into i and j in vertical direction, the first part has i+1 columns (from 0 to i), which is at least 1 (since i >=0). The second part has j - i columns (i+1 to j), which is j >=i+1, so j-i >=1. The third part has (m-1) - (j+1) +1 = m - j -1 columns. Wait, for example, m=5, j can be up to m-2=3. So j+1=4. Then third part is columns 4 to 4 (since m-1=4). So 4-4+1=1 column.

So all splits considered in the loops will have all three parts with at least one column (vertical) or row (horizontal).

So no need to check that again in the code.

So the steps are:

Compute total_sum. If not equal to A+B+C, return 0.

Else, proceed to check all possible splits.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:

3 3

1 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 1

A B C =3 3 3.

Total_sum is 9. A+B+C=9. Proceed.

Vertical splits: m=3.

Possible i ranges from 0 to m-3=0. So i=0. j can be from i+1=1 to m-2=1. So j=1.

sum1 = columns 0..0 → sum is column 0's sum. Each column has 3 (each row has 1, 3 rows → 3). So sum1=3.

sum2 = columns 1..1 → sum 3.

sum3 = columns 2..2 → sum3=3.

So sorted sums are [3,3,3], which matches the target sorted [3,3,3]. So this is a valid split. So vertical splits contribute 1.

Now, horizontal splits: n=3. Possible i ranges from 0 to n-3=0. j ranges from 1 to n-2=1. So i=0, j=1.

sum1 = rows 0..0 → sum is 3.

sum2= rows 1..1 →3.

sum3=rows 2..2 →3.

So sorted sums are same. So this is another valid split. So total count is 1 (vertical) +1 (horizontal) =2. Which matches the example.

Second example:

Input:

2 5

1 1 1 1 1 → sum is 5.

2 2 2 2 2 → sum is 10.

So row sums are 5 and 10. Column sums: each column is 1+2=3. So 5 columns, each sum 3. So total_sum is 5+10=15. A, B, C are 3,6,6. Sum is 15. So proceed.

Check vertical splits: m=5. The possible i ranges from 0 to 5-3=2. j ranges from i+1 to 3.

For each i and j, the three sums would be:

sum1: sum of 0..i columns. Each column is 3. So sum1 = (i+1)*3.

sum2: sum of (i+1)..j columns. (j - i) *3.

sum3: sum of (j+1)..4 columns. (4 - j) *3.

We need these three numbers to be 3,6,6 in any order.

So possible combinations:

sum1 + sum2 + sum3 =15.

Looking for 3,6,6.

sum1:3 → (i+1)*3=3 → i+1=1 → i=0. sum2:6 → (j - i)*3=6 → j-i=2 → j=2. sum3:6 → (4-j)*3=6 → 4-j=2 → j=2. So j=2.

So sum1=3, sum2=3*(2-0) → (j=2, i=0). sum2= (2-0) *3 =6. sum3= (4-2) *3=6. So yes.

So this split is valid. So for vertical splits, this is one possible (i=0, j=2). Are there others?

Wait, i can be 0, and j can be 2. Are there other i and j?

For example, i=1, j=2: sum1= (1+1)*3=6. sum2= (2-1)*3=3. sum3= (4-2)*3=6. So sorted sums [3,6,6]. Which is valid. So this is another split.

i=0, j=1: sum1=3, sum2= (1-0)*3=3, sum3= (4-1)*3=9. Sorted [3,3,9]. Not matching.

i=0, j=3: j can't be 3 because m-2=5-2=3. j can be up to 3. i=0, j=3:

sum1=0+1=1 columns? Wait, m=5. For vertical splits, j can be up to m-2=3. So j=3 is allowed.

sum1: columns 0..0 → sum 3.

sum2: columns 1..3 → 3 columns → 9.

sum3: columns 4..4 →3.

So sums 3,9,3. Sorted [3,3,9]. Not matching.

Another i=2, j=3: sum1= (2+1)*3=9. sum2= (3-2)*3=3. sum3= (4-3)*3=3. So sums 9,3,3. Sorted [3,3,9]. No.

So vertical splits have two possibilities: i=0, j=2 and i=1, j=2.

Wait, for i=0, j=2: sum1=3, sum2= (2-0)*3=6, sum3= (4-2)*3=6. So sums 3,6,6. Which is correct.

For i=1, j=3: wait, j can't be 3 if i is 1. Because j must be >i. But m-2=3, j can be up to 3.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

i ranges from 0 to m-3 (5-3=2). So i can be 0,1,2.

For each i, j ranges from i+1 to m-2=3.

So for i=0: j can be 1,2,3.

i=0, j=1: sum1=3*1=3, sum2=3* (1-0) =3, sum3=3*(5-1-1) =3*3=9. Sums 3,3,9 → no.

i=0, j=2: sum1=3, sum2=3*(2-0) → 6, sum3=3*(5-2-1) =3*2=6. So yes.

i=0, j=3: sum1=3, sum2=3*(3-0) →9, sum3=3*(5-3-1) →3*1=3. So sums 3,9,3 → sorted [3,3,9]. No.

For i=1, j can be 2 or 3.

i=1, j=2: sum1= (1+1)*3=6. sum2= (2-1)*3=3. sum3=3*(5-2-1) =3*2=6. sums 6,3,6 → sorted [3,6,6]. So valid.

i=1, j=3: sum1=6, sum2=3*(3-1)=6, sum3=3*(5-3-1) =3*1=3. sums 6,6,3 → sorted same. Valid.

So here, for i=1, j=3, the sum3 is 3. So sums are 6,6,3 → sorted [3,6,6]. So that's valid.

Wait, but when i=1 and j=3, the sum3 is (j+1 to m-1 → j+1=4, m-1=4. So sum3 is column 4, which is 3. So yes. So sum3=3. So the three sums are 6,6,3. Which is valid.

So that's another valid split. So for vertical splits, there are two possibilities here?

Wait, in the example input 2, the output is 3. Let's see.

The input is:

2 5

Row 1: 1 1 1 1 1 → sum 5.

Row 2: 2 2 2 2 2 → sum 10.

A, B, C =3,6,6.

Total sum is 15, which matches 3+6+6=15.

Now, vertical splits:

We need sum1, sum2, sum3 to be 3,6,6.

Each column's sum is 1+2=3. So each column is 3.

Possible splits:

For vertical splits, there are 5 columns. So possible splits:

i and j can be:

i=0, j=2 → sum1=3*1=3, sum2=3*2=6, sum3=3*2=6 → valid. So this is one split.

i=0, j=3 → sum1=3*1=3, sum2=3*3=9, sum3=3*1=3 → no.

i=1, j=2 → sum1=3*2=6, sum2=3*1=3, sum3=3*2=6 → valid. So this is another split.

i=1, j=3 → sum1=6, sum2=3*2=6, sum3=3*1=3 → valid.

i=2, j=3 → sum1=3*3=9, sum2=3*1=3, sum3=3*1=3 → no.

So vertical splits have three valid splits: i=0,j=2; i=1,j=2; i=1,j=3. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, when i=1 and j=3:

sum1 is columns 0..1 → sum is 3+3=6.

sum2 is columns 2..3 → 3+3=6.

sum3 is columns 4 →3.

So sums are 6,6,3 → sorted to [3,6,6]. So this is valid.

So vertical splits contribute 3 possibilities.

But then, what about horizontal splits? The second example's output is 3, which comes from 3 splits in vertical direction and zero in horizontal?

The sample input's output is 3. Let's see.

But in the sample input, the grid is 2 rows. So horizontal splits can only be made in n=2 rows. For horizontal splits, two lines must be made. But n=2, so the possible splits are between rows 0 and 1. But that's only one possible split line, but we need two lines. So there's no possible horizontal split. Because n=2, so possible split positions are only between row 0 and 1. But to split into three parts, you need two split lines. But with n=2, you can't split into three parts. So horizontal splits are impossible.

Thus, all three valid splits are vertical.

So the sample output is 3.

So the code needs to compute all vertical splits correctly.

But according to the earlier code logic, for vertical splits:

i ranges from 0 to m-3. For m=5, m-3=2. So i can be 0,1,2.

For each i, j ranges from i+1 to m-2=3.

So for i=0:

j can be 1,2,3.

For j=1: sum1=3, sum2=3, sum3=9 → no.

j=2: sum1=3, sum2=6, sum3=6 → valid.

j=3: sum1=3, sum2=9, sum3=3 → no.

For i=1:

j can be 2,3.

j=2: sum1=6, sum2=3, sum3=6 → valid.

j=3: sum1=6, sum2=6, sum3=3 → valid.

For i=2:

j can be 3.

sum1=3*3=9, sum2=3*1=3, sum3=3*1=3 → sums 9,3,3 → no.

So vertical splits contribute 3 valid splits. Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code logic is correct.

Now, the code steps.

Now, code.

Read n and m.

Read n rows of m integers. Then read A, B, C.

Compute row_sums and column_sums.

Compute total_sum. If not A+B+C, output 0.

Else, compute the prefixes for vertical and horizontal.

Then process vertical splits:

count_vert = 0

for i in 0 to m-3:

   for j in i+1 to m-2:

      sum1 = v_prefix[i+1] - v_prefix[0]

      sum2 = v_prefix[j+1] - v_prefix[i+1]

      sum3 = v_prefix[m] - v_prefix[j+1]

      if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted([A, B, C]):

          count_vert +=1

Wait, m-2 is the maximum j allowed. Because j can be up to m-2 (since j+1 <= m-1). For example, when m=5, j can be up to 3 (so j+1=4, which is m-1=4).

Wait, in code, for vertical splits:

i can range from 0 to m-3 (inclusive). Because when i = m-3, then j can be i+1 = m-2, and j+1 = m-1. So third part is j+1 to m-1 → m-1 - (j+1) +1 = m-1 -j. j = m-2 → m-1 - (m-2) = 1 column. So yes.

So for i in 0 to m-3, inclusive.

Then j ranges from i+1 to m-2, inclusive.

So the code for vertical splits is:

for i in range(m-2):

   for j in range(i+1, m-1):

       compute sums.

Wait, in Python, the ranges are exclusive. So for m-2, the upper limit is m-2. For example, m=5. m-3=2. So i ranges from 0 to 2 (inclusive) → in code, for i in range(m-2): but m-2 is 3. Wait, no.

Wait, m-3 is the maximum i for vertical splits.

Wait, vertical splits i can be 0, 1, ..., m-3. So the number of possible i values is m-3+1 = m-2.

In Python, to loop from 0 to m-3 inclusive, the code is for i in range(m-2):

Because range(m-2) gives 0,1,..., m-3-1? Wait, no. range(m-2) gives 0 to m-3.

Yes. For example, m=5: m-2 is 3 → range(3) is 0,1,2 → m-3 is 2 → correct.

So code for vertical:

for i in range(m-2):

   for j in range(i+1, m-1):

      compute sums.

Because j can be from i+1 to m-2 (inclusive). But in code, m-1 is the upper limit, but range is exclusive, so j ranges up to m-2.

Yes. For example, m=5: j can be from i+1 to 3 (since m-1=4-1=3+1? Wait, j's upper limit is m-2=5-2=3. So code for j in range(i+1, m-1):

m-1 is 4-1=4 for m=5? Wait, no. m is the number of columns. For vertical splits, j can be up to m-2. So in code, j's upper limit is m-2. So the code should have j in range(i+1, m-1) → because m-1 is not inclusive. For example, m-1 is 3, so j ranges from i+1 to 3 (since 3 is m-2 for m=5). So code is correct.

Yes.

Similarly for horizontal splits.

So code:

Compute row_sums = [sum(row) for row in grid]

column_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*grid)] → using zip to transpose the grid and get columns.

Then, compute row_prefix and column_prefix.

row_prefix = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

   row_prefix[i+1] = row_prefix[i] + row_sums[i]

Similarly for column_prefix.

Then, process horizontal splits:

count_horiz =0

for i in range(n-2):

   for j in range(i+1, n-1):

      sum1 = row_prefix[i+1] - row_prefix[0]

      sum2 = row_prefix[j+1] - row_prefix[i+1]

      sum3 = row_prefix[n] - row_prefix[j+1]

      if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted([A, B, C]):

          count_horiz +=1

Now, the code for the vertical splits:

But wait, for vertical splits, the code is:

for i in range(m-2):

   for j in range(i+1, m-1):

      sum1 = column_prefix[i+1] - column_prefix[0]

      sum2 = column_prefix[j+1] - column_prefix[i+1]

      sum3 = column_prefix[m] - column_prefix[j+1]

      if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted_target:

          count_vert +=1

Yes.

Putting it all together.

Now, code steps:

Read n and m.

Read n lines of m numbers each.

Read A, B, C.

Compute row_sums and column_sums.

Compute total_sum. If sum(row_sums) != A+B+C, print 0.

Else:

compute row_prefix and column_prefix.

compute sorted_target = sorted([A, B, C]).

count_vert and count_horiz.

sum counts and output.

Now, code.

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    grid = [list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())) for _ in range(n)]
    A, B, C = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in grid]
    col_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*grid)]
    total = sum(row_sums)

    if A + B + C != total:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return

    sorted_target = sorted([A, B, C])

    count = 0

    # Process vertical splits (columns)
    col_prefix = [0] * (m + 1)
    for i in range(m):
        col_prefix[i+1] = col_prefix[i] + col_sums[i]

    for i in range(m-2):
        for j in range(i+1, m-1):
            sum1 = col_prefix[i+1]
            sum2 = col_prefix[j+1] - col_prefix[i+1]
            sum3 = col_prefix[m] - col_prefix[j+1]
            if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted_target:
                count += 1

    # Process horizontal splits (rows)
    row_prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        row_prefix[i+1] = row_prefix[i] + row_sums[i]

    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            sum1 = row_prefix[i+1]
            sum2 = row_prefix[j+1] - row_prefix[i+1]
            sum3 = row_prefix[n] - row_prefix[j+1]
            if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted_target:
                count += 1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3 3
1 2 3
3 1 2
2 3 1
5 6 7
""",
            "output": \
"""\
0
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

So the code should handle all cases.

Now, code.

Implementing this in Python:

Read the grid as a list of lists.

Then compute row_sums and column_sums.

Then compute the prefixes.

Then check for vertical and horizontal splits.

Edge cases:

Case where both vertical and horizontal splits are possible.

Like the first example.

Another case: when a split could be valid in both directions.

But each is counted separately.

So code should sum both counts.

Thus, the code should be correct.

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

row_sums = [sum(row) for row in grid]
col_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*grid)]
total = sum(row_sums)

if A + B + C != total:
    print(0)
    exit()

sorted_target = sorted([A, B, C])

count = 0

# Process vertical splits (columns)
col_prefix = [0] * (m + 1)
for i in range(m):
    col_prefix[i+1] = col_prefix[i] + col_sums[i]

for i in range(m-2):
    for j in range(i+1, m-1):
        sum1 = col_prefix[i+1]
        sum2 = col_prefix[j+1] - col_prefix[i+1]
        sum3 = col_prefix[m] - col_prefix[j+1]
        if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted_target:
            count += 1

# Process horizontal splits (rows)
row_prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(n):
    row_prefix[i+1] = row_prefix[i] + row_sums[i]

for i in range(n-2):
    for j in range(i+1, n-1):
        sum1 = row_prefix[i+1]
        sum2 = row_prefix[j+1] - row_prefix[i+1]
        sum3 = row_prefix[n] - row_prefix[j+1]
        if sorted([sum1, sum2, sum3]) == sorted_target:
            count += 1

print(count)
```
