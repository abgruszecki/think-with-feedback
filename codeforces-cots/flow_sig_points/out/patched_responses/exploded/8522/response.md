Okay, let's try to solve this problem. The problem is about applying a certain XOR operation repeatedly until all elements are zero. We need to find the number of steps required or return -1 if it's impossible.

First, let's understand the operation. Each step, every element a_i is replaced with a_i XOR a_{(i+1) mod n}. So for each position, the new value is the XOR of itself and the next element (with wrap-around for the last element). The question is: after how many such steps does the array become all zeros? If it's never possible, output -1.

Hmm. Let's think about small examples. For instance, the third example where n=1. The array is [14]. Applying the operation once would compute a_0 XOR a_0 (since (0+1) mod 1 is 0). That's 14 XOR 14, which is 0. So after one step, it's all zeros. So the answer is 1.

Another example: if the array is all zeros to start with, then the answer is 0.

The first example has n=4. The first step transforms the array into [3,3,3,3], and the next step zeros it. So two steps.

So what's the pattern here? How do the steps affect the array over time?

Let's consider that each step is a transformation T. We need to find the smallest k such that T^k(a) is all zeros. If no such k exists, return -1.

But how do we model this transformation? Since n can be up to 2^20, we can't simulate each step for large n. So there must be a pattern or mathematical structure here that allows us to compute the answer efficiently.

Wait, the problem statement says that n is a power of two. That's a crucial hint. So n can be 1, 2, 4, ..., up to 2^20. So perhaps the solution involves properties related to the binary representation of the steps, given that n is a power of two.

Let me think about how each element evolves after each step. Maybe the steps can be considered in terms of binary exponents. For example, after 1 step, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}. After two steps, perhaps each element depends on a combination of more elements. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each element after k steps is a certain XOR combination of elements from the original array. Let's model this.

Suppose we denote that after k steps, the new value at position i is the XOR of a certain subset of the original array elements. Then, after each step, the dependencies (which elements are XORed into each position) might form a pattern based on powers of two.

Wait, let's think recursively. Let's imagine that after each step, the number of elements that influence each position doubles in some way. For example, after the first step, each position i is a_i XOR a_{i+1}. Then, in the next step, each position would be (a_i XOR a_{i+1}) XOR (a_{i+1} XOR a_{i+2})). Which simplifies to a_i XOR a_{i+2}. Wait, but that's for the second step. Wait, no. Let's actually compute it.

Suppose the array after first step is b[i] = a[i] XOR a[i+1 mod n].

Then the second step is c[i] = b[i] XOR b[i+1 mod n].

Substituting b[i] and b[i+1], c[i] = (a[i] XOR a[i+1]) XOR (a[i+1] XOR a[i+2]).

But XOR is associative and commutative, so this is a[i] XOR a[i+2]. Because (x XOR y) XOR (y XOR z) = x XOR z.

Wait, let's verify:

(x XOR y) XOR (y XOR z) = x XOR y XOR y XOR z = x XOR (y XOR y) XOR z = x XOR 0 XOR z = x XOR z.

Yes. So after two steps, each element is a[i] XOR a[i+2 mod n]. So, for n=4, the positions are:

i=0: a[0] XOR a[2]

i=1: a[1] XOR a[3]

i=2: a[2] XOR a[0]

i=3: a[3] XOR a[1]

Wait, but after the second step, applying this would result in each element being the XOR of elements two apart. Then, if we have another step, step 3, the elements would be:

For each i, the new element would be (a[i] XOR a[i+2]) XOR (a[i+2] XOR a[i+4 mod n]). Which simplifies to a[i] XOR a[i+4 mod n]. But if n=4, then i+4 mod 4 is i. So for n=4, the third step would be (a[i] XOR a[i+2]) XOR (a[i+2] XOR a[i]) → (a[i] XOR a[i+2] XOR a[i+2] XOR a[i]) → 0. So after three steps, all elements are zero.

Wait, but in the first example, after two steps, the array becomes zero. So perhaps the pattern depends on the steps in a way that the number of steps required is related to the log2(n) or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of steps required is determined by the binary representation of n. For example, when n is a power of two, the steps required could be up to n-1, but maybe there's a pattern here.

Wait, let's think for n=4. The first example took two steps. Let's see:

Original array: [1,2,1,2]

Step 1: Each element is XOR of current and next. So:

0: 1 XOR 2 = 3

1: 2 XOR 1 = 3

2: 1 XOR 2 = 3

3: 2 XOR 1 = 3 → array [3,3,3,3]

Step 2: Each element is XOR of current and next. So 3 XOR 3 = 0. So all elements become zero. So after two steps.

So for n=4, two steps. But according to the previous thought, step 2 would be the XOR of elements two apart. For example, in step 2, each element is a[i] XOR a[i+2]. For the array after step 1 (all 3s), a[i] XOR a[i+2] is 3 XOR 3 = 0. So that's correct.

Wait, in the first step, the array becomes [3,3,3,3]. Then in the next step, each element is 3 XOR 3 (since next element is 3), so 0. So that's step 2.

So for n=4, the answer was 2. How does that relate to log2(n) being 2. So maybe the steps are up to log2(n) steps. Or perhaps the maximum steps is log2(n) multiplied by something.

Another example in the problem is n=8, output 5. Let's see:

Input is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The output is 5 steps. Hmm. So 5 is not a power of two. So perhaps there's a more complex pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of steps required is the sum of certain exponents. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the process can be viewed as a binary tree where each level corresponds to a step. For instance, each step's operation combines elements that are a certain distance apart. For example, step 1 combines elements 1 apart, step 2 combines elements 2 apart, step 3 combines elements 4 apart, etc. Wait, but in the first example, step 2 combines elements 2 apart (since after step 1, the array is [3,3,3,3], step 2 combines each element with next (so 1 apart again). Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are such that each step's operation doubles the "distance" between the elements being XORed. For example, step 1: distance 1, step 2: distance 2, step 3: distance 4, etc., until distance exceeds n. But how?

Wait, for the first example, after the first step, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}. Then after the second step, each element is (a_i XOR a_{i+1}) XOR (a_{i+1} XOR a_{i+2})), which is a_i XOR a_{i+2}. So the distance is 2. Then the next step would be a_i XOR a_{i+4} mod n. But for n=4, 4 mod 4 is 0. So for example, after step 3, each element would be (a_i XOR a_{i+2}) XOR (a_{i+2} XOR a_{i+4 mod4}=a_i). So that would be a_i XOR a_{i+2} XOR a_{i+2} XOR a_i = 0. So step 3 would make all zeros. But the first example required two steps. So maybe this pattern depends on the steps.

Hmm, perhaps the process can be viewed in terms of binary representations. Let's think of each step as a bit in the binary representation of the number of steps. For example, if after k steps, the array is all zeros, then k must be a sum of certain powers of two.

But how to model that.

Alternatively, let's model the transformation. Let's say that after each step, the array is transformed in such a way that each element is the XOR of pairs of elements that are 2^m steps apart. For example, after m steps, the distance is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, considering the first example:

n=4, which is 2^2.

Step 1: each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1} (distance 1, which is 2^0).

Step 2: each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2} (distance 2, which is 2^1).

Wait, but in step 2, after applying the first step's array. So perhaps each step doubles the distance.

But then, for n=2^m, the maximum steps required would be m. For example, for n=4 (2^2), steps up to 2. But the first example required two steps, which equals log2(n) * something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after log2(n) steps, the array becomes all zeros. But how?

Alternatively, think recursively. For n=2^k, after each step, the problem reduces to two subproblems of size n/2. For example, in the case of n=4, after two steps, the array is [a0 XOR a2, a1 XOR a3, a2 XOR a0, a3 XOR a1]. But after step 2, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2 mod4}. Then, if we apply another step (step3), each element would be (a_i XOR a_{i+2}) XOR (a_{i+2} XOR a_i), which is zero. So after three steps. But the first example's array became zero in two steps. So perhaps the number of steps depends on the initial array.

This suggests that the number of steps is related to the binary representation of the problem. So perhaps we need to compute for each possible step count, whether applying that number of steps will lead to all zeros.

But simulating each step is O(n), which would be O(n) per step. For n up to 2^20 (about a million), and steps up to 2^20, this would be O(n^2), which is 1e12 operations, which is way too slow.

So simulation is not feasible. Therefore, we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the transformations. Each step, the array is transformed into a new array. Let's model this as a linear transformation over GF(2), since XOR is addition in GF(2). Then, each step's transformation can be represented as a matrix, and applying k steps is equivalent to multiplying by the matrix raised to the k-th power. But even this approach would be O(n^3) for matrix exponentiation, which is impossible for n up to a million.

But perhaps there's a pattern in these transformations that allows us to compute the steps quickly.

Wait, but the problem states that n is a power of two. So maybe the transformations have a structure that can be exploited. For example, after m steps, the array's elements depend on elements that are 2^m positions apart.

Alternatively, for a given step count s, the array after s steps can be computed by combining elements in the original array at positions that are (s) apart, but in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the process after s steps can be represented as each element being the XOR of a certain subset of the original array's elements. The subset would be determined by s and the position i.

Let's see: for s=1, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

s=2: (a_i XOR a_{i+1}) XOR (a_{i+1} XOR a_{i+2}) ) = a_i XOR a_{i+2}.

s=3: XOR of the previous two steps? Let's see. The third step would take each element from the s=2 array, which is a_i XOR a_{i+2}, and XOR it with the next element (i+1 mod n), which is a_{i+1} XOR a_{i+3} mod n. So for s=3, the element is (a_i XOR a_{i+2}) XOR (a_{i+1} XOR a_{i+3}).

But this seems to complicate things. How can we model this for any s?

Alternatively, think of the steps as forming a binary expansion. For example, each step in the process corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of s. For example, s can be expressed as a sum of powers of two, and the transformation for s steps is a combination of transformations for each of these bits.

But how?

Wait, perhaps each step doubles the "stride" of the XOR operations. For example, after 1 step, the stride is 1. After 2 steps, the stride is 2. After 3 steps, the stride is 4, and so on. Wait, but this is not clear. Let's think for s steps:

After the first step, the stride is 1 (each element depends on the next element).

After two steps, each element depends on elements two apart.

After three steps, each element depends on elements four apart, and so on. So each step doubles the stride. Wait, but how?

Wait, in the first example:

s=1: stride 1.

s=2: stride 2.

s=3: stride 4 (but n=4, so 4 mod 4 is 0. So elements would depend on themselves, leading to zero).

But in the first example, after two steps, the array becomes zero. So for s=2, the stride is 2. For n=4, 2 steps would combine elements 2 apart, which for each i is a_i XOR a_{i+2}. If the array after s=2 is all zeros, then a_i must equal a_{i+2} for all i. So the array has a periodicity of 2.

In the first example, the original array is [1,2,1,2], which is periodic with period 2. So after two steps, the array becomes zero. So perhaps the number of steps required is determined by the minimal k such that the array has certain periodicities.

But how to model this for general cases.

Alternatively, think of the steps as a binary decomposition. For example, each step can be considered as a bit in the binary representation of the required steps. For example, the answer can be up to log2(n) steps, but perhaps it's more complex.

Another observation: if after k steps, the array is all zeros, then applying another k steps would leave it as zero. So the process would cycle with period k, but if k is the minimal such, then it's the answer.

But how to find the minimal k.

Alternatively, think about the problem in reverse. Suppose after k steps the array is all zeros. Then, the array before the k-th step must be such that when the transformation is applied, it becomes all zeros.

For example, if applying the transformation once to array B gives all zeros, then B must satisfy B_i = B_{i+1} for all i. Because each element B_i XOR B_{i+1} must be zero. So B is a uniform array. Then the step before all zeros must be an array where all elements are equal. So for example, in the first example, the array after step 1 is all 3s, so applying step 2 (the next step) gives all zeros.

So the problem reduces to finding the earliest step k where the array after (k-1) steps is a uniform array, and applying the transformation once gives all zeros.

But how do we track this.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps required is the minimal s such that after s steps, the array is all zeros. Let's consider the properties of s.

We can note that if s is the answer, then s must be a divisor of some power of two. Because n is a power of two, and the steps may follow a pattern that doubles the stride each time.

Wait, for example, the first example required 2 steps. 2 is 2^1. The third example required 1 step (2^0). The fourth example required 5 steps. Hmm, 5 is not a power of two. So this line of thinking may not hold.

Another approach: notice that after log2(n) steps, the array becomes a certain form. For example, after m steps where m=log2(n), the array would have each element being the XOR of all elements in the original array. Because each step combines elements in a way that the distance doubles each time.

Wait, let's see. Suppose we have n=4 (log2(n)=2). Let's see what happens after 2 steps.

Original array: [a0, a1, a2, a3].

Step1: a0^a1, a1^a2, a2^a3, a3^a0.

Step2: (a0^a1) ^ (a1^a2) = a0 ^ a2, and similarly for others. So step2's array is [a0^a2, a1^a3, a2^a0, a3^a1].

Step3: Each element would be (a0^a2) ^ (a2^a0) = 0. So after step3, the array is all zeros.

But this is only if the array after step2 has a0^a2 equals a2^a0, which is always true since XOR is commutative. So the array after step2 is [a0^a2, a1^a3, a0^a2, a1^a3], which is a periodic array with period 2. So applying step3 would zero the array.

But in the first example, the array after step2 was all zeros. So the array after step1 was all 3's. Then step2 made all zeros.

So this suggests that the number of steps can be up to log2(n) steps, but sometimes it can be less.

Alternatively, the number of steps required is the minimal s such that the array after s steps is all zeros, and s is less than or equal to n-1.

But how to find this s efficiently.

Another observation: the transformation is linear. So, if we can model the transformations as linear operations over GF(2), then the problem reduces to finding the minimal s where the transformation matrix raised to the s-th power, multiplied by the initial array, gives the zero vector.

But the issue is that the size of the matrix is n x n, which for n=1e6 is impossible to handle.

So this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative idea: Since n is a power of two, perhaps the number of steps required is a sum of different powers of two. For example, the answer could be the binary representation of the step count.

Alternatively, the steps required are such that each bit in their binary representation corresponds to applying a certain transformation with a certain stride.

Wait, here's an interesting thought. Let's represent the steps as binary numbers. For example, each bit in the binary representation of the required steps determines whether a certain transformation is applied. For example, if we decompose the steps into their binary digits, and for each bit set, apply a transformation that combines elements at a distance of 2^m, where m is the bit position.

But how?

Alternatively, for the step count s, when written in binary, each bit indicates a certain transformation. For instance, the bits of s determine the strides used in the XOR operations.

But this is vague. Let's try to find a pattern for small s.

Let's consider the transformation applied for s steps. Let's model how the elements are combined.

For example:

s=1: each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

s=2: each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2}.

s=3: after s=2, we have a_i XOR a_{i+2}, then applying s=1 again would give (a_i XOR a_{i+2}) XOR (a_{i+2} XOR a_{i+3} modn). So it's a_i XOR a_{i+3}.

Wait, but I'm not sure. This seems complicated.

Another approach: Let's look for the answer in the form of s being a sum of distinct powers of two. For example, the fourth example's answer is 5, which is 4 + 1. Maybe there's a way to decompose the steps into individual bits and compute the required s.

But how?

Alternatively, think of the steps as being applied in reverse. Suppose after k steps, the array is zero. Then before the k-th step, the array must have been such that applying the operation once would yield zero. So for the k-th step, the array before must be a uniform array (all elements equal). Because when you apply the operation, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}, which for a uniform array would be zero (since a_i == a_{i+1}).

So for example, if after k-1 steps, the array is uniform, then after k steps it's zero.

Thus, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of steps required to reach a uniform array, plus one.

But how to find the minimal steps to reach a uniform array.

Wait, but this is only one possible scenario. For instance, the third example: after 1 step, the array is zero. So the previous array was a uniform array. The initial array was [14], which when the operation is applied once becomes zero. Because for n=1, each element is a_0 XOR a_0 mod 1 (which is a_0 again). So for n=1, applying the operation once gives zero.

So the process could be:

We need to find the first s such that after s steps, the array is all zeros. To do this, we can check for each s in increasing order whether the array after s steps is all zeros. But again, for large n, this is not feasible.

But perhaps there's a way to compute s efficiently.

Another observation: For the array to become all zeros, the sum (in XOR terms) must be zero. However, since XOR is addition in GF(2), the sum of all elements after each step remains the same as the initial sum. Wait, no. Let's think: each step transforms each element a_i into a_i XOR a_{i+1}. So the sum (XOR of all elements) after the transformation is (a_0 XOR a_1) XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) XOR ... XOR (a_{n-1} XOR a_0). Let's compute this:

Each a_i appears exactly twice (once as a_i in a_i XOR a_{i+1}, and once as a_{i} in a_{i-1} XOR a_i). So when XORed together, all terms cancel out. So the total sum after each step is zero. So if the initial sum (XOR of all elements) is not zero, then it's impossible for the array to become all zeros. Because each step preserves the sum (XOR) of all elements. So the sum after any step is the same as the initial sum. Therefore, if the initial sum is not zero, the answer is -1.

Wait, but that's a crucial point. So for the array to become all zeros, the sum (XOR) of all elements must be zero.

So the first thing to check is whether the XOR of all elements is zero. If not, output -1.

Wait, but let's verify with the examples:

First example: 1, 2, 1, 2. XOR sum is 1 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 = (1 XOR 1) XOR (2 XOR 2) = 0 XOR 0 = 0. So possible.

Second example: 0,0. Sum is 0. Possible.

Third example: 14. Sum is 14. But the answer is 1. Wait, but applying one step gives 0. So in that case, the sum after the step is zero. But according to the earlier reasoning, the sum should be preserved. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect.

Let me recheck. For the third example, initial sum is 14. After one step, the array becomes 14 XOR 14 = 0. So the sum after one step is zero, which is different from the initial sum. So the previous reasoning was wrong.

So what's wrong here.

Ah, right! Because in the case of n=1, the operation is a_0 XOR a_0 mod 1 (which is a_0 XOR a_0) = 0. So the sum after the step is zero. But the initial sum is 14. So the sum is not preserved.

So the previous reasoning is incorrect. Therefore, my assumption that the sum is preserved is wrong.

Hmm. So that idea is invalid. Therefore, we need to think differently.

So that approach is invalid. Let's think again.

So the sum (XOR) of all elements can change after each step. For example, in the third example, it changes from 14 to 0.

So the sum is not preserved. Therefore, there's no obvious invariant here. Thus, the initial check for sum zero is not sufficient.

So that approach is not correct.

But let's think again. For general n, the sum after each step is the XOR of all elements in the previous array. Let's compute the sum after one step.

The new array is b_i = a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

The sum S' = XOR of all b_i.

Each b_i is a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

So S' = (a_0 XOR a_1) XOR (a_1 XOR a_2) XOR ... XOR (a_{n-1} XOR a_0).

But XOR is associative and commutative. So S' = (a_0 XOR a_0) XOR (a_1 XOR a_1) XOR ... XOR (a_{n-1} XOR a_{n-1}).

Each pair a_i XOR a_i is zero. So S' is zero.

So for n even, the sum after each step is zero. But for n odd, this is not the case.

Wait, n is a power of two. So n is even except when n=1.

Wait, the problem states that n is a power of two. So n can be 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. So when n is even, the sum after each step is zero. But for n=1, the sum after the first step is zero.

Wait, in the case of n=1, after one step, the array is a_0 XOR a_0 = 0. So sum is zero.

So for n being a power of two, after each step, the sum of the array is zero. Because for n even, the sum becomes zero after one step. For n=1, the sum becomes zero after one step.

But wait, let's test with n=2:

Original array [a0, a1]. Sum is a0 XOR a1.

After step 1: [a0 XOR a1, a1 XOR a0]. Sum is (a0 XOR a1) XOR (a1 XOR a0) = 0.

So for n=2, after one step, sum is zero.

For n=4, after one step, sum is zero.

But for n=1, after one step, sum is zero.

So in all cases, after one step, the sum is zero. Because the sum S' is the XOR of all elements in the new array, which for any n (power of two) becomes zero. Because when you XOR all elements, each original element a_i appears exactly twice (for even n), but for n=1, it appears twice (a_0 XOR a_0).

So after the first step, the sum is zero. And in all subsequent steps, the sum remains zero. Because each step transforms the array such that the sum of the new array is the XOR of all elements, which for n being a power of two (even or odd?), but according to previous reasoning, after step 1, the sum is zero.

Wait, for n=1:

Original array [a0]. Sum is a0.

After step 1: [a0 XOR a0] → sum is 0.

After step 2: [0 XOR 0] → sum 0.

So sum becomes zero after one step, and remains zero.

For n=2:

Original array [a0, a1]. Sum is a0 XOR a1.

Step 1: sum is (a0 XOR a1) XOR (a1 XOR a0) → 0.

So for any step after the first, the sum remains zero.

Therefore, the sum after step 1 is zero, and for all steps after that, the sum remains zero.

So the sum after the first step is zero. Therefore, for the array to become all zeros, the sum after step 1 must be zero. But after step 1, sum is zero. So for any steps beyond the first, the sum is zero.

But in the case of the third example, the array becomes zero after step 1. So sum is zero.

But in the first example, after step 1, the sum is 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 → (3 XOR 3) XOR (3 XOR 3) → 0 XOR 0 → 0.

Yes. So sum is zero.

So, the sum after the first step is zero, and remains zero for all subsequent steps.

But how does this help us?

Well, if after step 1, the sum is zero, then for the array to become all zeros, all elements must be equal. Because if all elements are equal, then applying the transformation once would result in each element being XOR of two equal elements, which is zero.

Thus, the key insight is that if after s steps, all elements are the same, then after s+1 steps, they become zero.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal s such that after s steps, all elements are equal. Then the answer is s+1.

But if the initial array is all zeros, then s is zero. So the answer is zero.

Wait, the steps are defined as applying the transformation until the array becomes all zeros. So if the array is initially all zeros, then no steps are needed.

So, to find the answer, we need to:

1. Check if the array is initially all zeros. If yes, return 0.

2. Otherwise, check if after some steps s, the array becomes uniform (all elements equal). The minimal such s plus 1 is the answer.

3. If no such s exists, return -1.

But how to determine if the array can become uniform after some steps.

Moreover, note that after the first step, the sum of the array is zero. So if the array becomes uniform, then all elements must be equal to zero. Because the sum of the array is zero (after step 1), so a uniform array must have all elements zero. But then applying the transformation again would leave the array as zero.

Wait, no. Because after step s, if the array is uniform and non-zero (since the sum is zero, the uniform value must be zero). So the only possible uniform array that can lead to zero in the next step is zero. But that's impossible, because if the array is zero, then the next step would also be zero.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me rephrase:

If after s steps, the array is uniform, then applying the transformation once would give all elements zero. Because each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1} mod n. But if a_i are all the same, then each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1} mod n = same XOR same = 0. So the next step will produce all zeros.

So, the answer is s+1 steps.

But the minimal s is the minimal steps required to reach a uniform array.

So the problem is to find the minimal s where after s steps, the array is uniform, and then return s+1. If no such s exists, return -1.

But how to find such s.

Now, the question is: how to find the minimal s such that after s steps, the array becomes uniform.

We can model the transformations for s steps as follows.

For each s, after applying s steps, each element in the array is a combination of the original elements. For example, after s steps, the element at position i is the XOR of certain elements from the original array.

But for n being a power of two, perhaps the combination is such that the elements after s steps have a certain periodicity.

Another observation: the transformation after each step has a pattern where the distance between the elements being XORed doubles each step. For example:

- After 1 step: each element is a combination of adjacent elements (distance 1).
- After 2 steps: each element is a combination of elements 2 apart.
- After 3 steps: elements 4 apart.
- And so on, until the distance exceeds n.

But how?

Let me try to see for s steps:

s=1: distance 1.

s=2: distance 2.

s=3: distance 4.

s=4: distance 8.

etc. Because each step doubles the distance.

If this is the case, then for n=2^k, after k steps, the distance would be 2^{k-1}, which is n/2. Then, after k steps, each element is the XOR of two elements n/2 apart. Applying one more step would then make the distance n, which is equivalent to 0 mod n. So each element would be XOR of itself and itself, resulting in zero. So after k steps, if the array is uniform, then the next step would zero it.

But this would require that after k steps, the array is uniform.

But how to find s steps where the array becomes uniform.

Alternatively, after each step, the array is transformed such that each element is the XOR of pairs of elements 2^{s-1} positions apart.

If that's the case, then after s steps, each element is the XOR of elements 2^{s-1} apart. But how to model this.

For example, for s=1, the elements are XOR of adjacent elements (distance 1=2^0). For s=2, distance 2=2^1. For s=3, distance 4=2^2, etc.

But how to confirm this.

Let's take n=8 and s=3. Then, each element after 3 steps would be the XOR of elements 4 apart. For example, the element at position i would be a_i XOR a_{i+4 mod 8}.

If this is true, then after three steps, the array is composed of pairs of elements that are 4 apart. Then, if all such pairs are equal (a_i = a_{i+4}), then the array after three steps would be uniform. Then, applying step 4 would zero the array.

But how does this align with the fourth example:

Input 8 elements [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Output is 5.

Let's see:

The output is 5 steps. So after 5 steps, the array is zero. So after 4 steps, the array must be uniform.

But according to the previous hypothesis, after 3 steps, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+4} mod 8. For the initial array:

After step 3, each element i is a_i XOR a_{i+4}.

Original array is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

After step1: each element is a[i] XOR a[i+1 mod8].

Step1 array:

0^1=1

1^2=3

2^3=1

3^4=7

4^5=1

5^6=3

6^7=1

7^0=7

So array after step1: [1,3,1,7,1,3,1,7]

Sum is 1^3^1^7^1^3^1^7 = (1^1^1^1) ^ (3^3) ^ (7^7) = 0 ^0 ^0 =0.

Step2: each element is step1[i] XOR step1[i+1 mod8].

Let's compute:

i=0: 1^3=2

i=1:3^1=2

i=2:1^7=6

i=3:7^1=6

i=4:1^3=2

i=5:3^1=2

i=6:1^7=6

i=7:7^1=6

Array after step2: [2,2,6,6,2,2,6,6]

Step3: each element is step2[i] XOR step2[i+1 mod8].

i=0:2^2=0

i=1:2^6=4

i=2:6^6=0

i=3:6^2=4

i=4:2^2=0

i=5:2^6=4

i=6:6^6=0

i=7:6^2=4

Array after step3: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]

Step4: each element is step3[i] XOR step3[i+1 mod8].

i=0:0^4=4

i=1:4^0=4

i=2:0^4=4

i=3:4^0=4

i=4:0^4=4

i=5:4^0=4

i=6:0^4=4

i=7:4^0=4

Array after step4: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]

Step5: apply the transformation once to get all zeros.

So yes, the answer is 5 steps.

So after step4, the array is uniform (all 4s). Then step5 makes it zero.

So the steps required are 4 steps to reach a uniform array, plus one more step, totaling 5.

Now, how to find the minimal s such that after s steps, the array is uniform.

In this example, s=4. So the answer is 4+1=5.

But how to model this.

The process after each step seems to involve combining elements with a distance that doubles each step. So after s steps, the distance is 2^{s-1}.

For example:

s=1 → distance 1=2^0.

s=2 → distance 2=2^1.

s=3 → distance 4=2^2.

s=4 → distance 8=2^3.

But for n=8, after s=3 steps, the distance is 4. Then, s=4 steps would have a distance of 8 mod8=0. So each element would be a_i XOR a_i=0. So after s=4 steps, the array is zero.

But in the fourth example, after s=4 steps, the array is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So why is that?

Ah, because perhaps the initial model is incorrect. Let's re-examine.

Wait, after step 4, the array is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is uniform. Then step5 (s=5) makes it zero.

But according to the previous model, after s=4 steps, the distance is 8 (which is 0 mod8). So each element would be a_i XOR a_{i+0} mod8 → a_i XOR a_i = 0. So the array after s=4 steps should be zero. But in reality, it's uniform. So the model must be wrong.

This suggests that the previous assumption about the steps doubling the distance each time is incorrect. So there's another pattern to be found.

Another approach: perhaps the number of steps s must be such that the array after s steps is uniform. This can be checked by verifying that for each i, the element after s steps is equal to the element after s steps at position 0.

But how to compute the array after s steps efficiently.

For n up to 2^20, simulating s steps is O(s*n), which is not feasible if s is large.

But perhaps the steps can be applied in binary increments. For example, each bit in the binary representation of s represents a certain transformation. For example, for each bit set in s, we can compute the transformation corresponding to that power of two steps.

But how to model this.

This is similar to exponentiation by squaring. For example, if we can compute the effect of applying 2^k steps in O(n) time, then we can combine these effects for the binary digits of s to find the total effect after s steps.

So, the idea is to decompose s into a sum of powers of two and apply the transformations for each power of two in log(s) steps.

But how to compute the effect of applying 2^k steps.

Let's think recursively. Suppose we can compute the array after m steps, and also after m steps again. Then combining them would give the array after 2m steps.

But this requires that the transformations can be composed.

Wait, each transformation is a function T. Applying T twice gives T^2.

But how does T^2 look?

In the first example, after two steps, each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2}. So T^2 is a transformation where each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2}.

Similarly, T^4 would be a transformation where each element is a_i XOR a_{i+4}, and so on.

Thus, each application of T^{2^k} results in elements being XORed with elements 2^k positions away.

If this is the case, then we can model the steps using binary lifting. For example, for each power of two (like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.), we can compute the array after applying 2^k steps, and combine them to reach s steps.

So, the plan is:

- Precompute the array after 1 step, 2 steps, 4 steps, 8 steps, etc., up to log2(n) steps.

- For each desired s, we can break it into a sum of these powers of two steps and apply them in sequence.

- After each application, the array is transformed by XORing elements 2^k positions apart.

But how to implement this.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if the initial array is all zeros. If yes, return 0.

2. Apply the first transformation (step 1). Check if the array is all zeros. If yes, return 1.

3. Compute the array after each power of two steps (up to log2(n) steps). For each power of two steps, the transformation is to XOR each element with the element 2^power steps away.

4. Use binary lifting to find the minimal s such that applying s steps results in a uniform array. Then the answer is s+1.

But how to implement this.

Wait, let's think of the process as follows: each step of applying T once is equivalent to combining elements in a certain way, and applying T 2^k times is equivalent to combining elements 2^k steps apart.

So, for each power of two, say 2^m, applying T 2^m times would result in each element being the XOR of elements 2^m positions apart. For example:

- Applying T once (2^0 steps) combines elements 1 position apart.

- Applying T twice (2^1 steps) combines elements 2 positions apart.

- Applying T four times (2^2 steps) combines elements 4 positions apart.

And so on.

Thus, for each power of two m, after 2^m steps, each element is the XOR of itself and the element 2^m positions away.

But how does this work when applying multiple powers.

For example, applying 3 steps (which is 2^1 + 2^0 steps):

First, apply 2^0 steps: each element is a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

Then, apply 2^1 steps: each element is (a_i XOR a_{i+1}) XOR (a_{i+2} XOR a_{i+3}).

But this may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the process of applying multiple steps can be combined by combining the elements in increasing order of power of two.

But this requires more detailed analysis.

Alternatively, the effect of applying s steps is equivalent to the sum of powers of two in its binary representation. For example, s=5 is 4 + 1. So we can apply the 1-step transformation, then the 4-step transformation.

But the order of application might matter.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for each bit in the binary representation of s, we can apply the corresponding power of two steps, and accumulate the effect.

But how to do this.

Perhaps the key insight is that applying steps in the order of increasing powers of two allows us to model the transformation.

For example, to compute the array after s steps, where s is a sum of 2^k's, we can process each bit in the binary representation of s from least significant to most significant. For each bit set, we apply the corresponding transformation.

Thus, the approach is:

- We start with the original array.

- For each bit position m (from 0 to log2(n)), we check if the current accumulated steps include 2^m steps. If yes, we apply the transformation for 2^m steps.

But how to apply the transformation for 2^m steps.

The transformation for 2^m steps would be to XOR each element with the element 2^m positions away.

But how?

Let's see:

For example, when m=0 (2^0=1), applying one step would transform the array into a_i XOR a_{i+1}.

But according to previous examples, after two steps (m=1), each element is a_i XOR a_{i+2}.

So applying two steps is equivalent to applying the transformation for m=1.

Thus, perhaps for each m, the transformation for 2^m steps is to XOR each element with the element 2^m positions away.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize the array as the original array.

Initialize the current accumulated steps as 0.

For m from 0 up to log2(n):

   if the current accumulated steps plus 2^m is <= s:

       apply the transformation for 2^m steps.

       add 2^m to the accumulated steps.

Thus, applying the transformation for 2^m steps is done by XORing each element with the element 2^m positions away.

But how does this work?

Let's take the example of the fourth example.

Original array: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

The answer is 5 steps.

We need to find s=4 steps to reach a uniform array.

So:

We need to find the binary representation of s=4, which is 100. So the bits are at m=2 (4=2^2).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the process is as follows:

Start with the original array.

For each m from 0 to log2(n) - 1:

   create a new array where each element is the XOR of the current element and the element 2^m positions away.

   update the array to this new array.

Each step m corresponds to applying 2^m steps.

But this may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you apply the transformation for 2^m steps, you are effectively combining elements that are 2^m apart. Then, after applying all the required bits, you get the array after s steps.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

For each m in 0 to log2(n) - 1:

   if the current s has the m-th bit set, then apply the transformation for 2^m steps, which is to XOR each element with the element 2^m positions away.

But this is a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps can be represented as a binary number, and for each bit set, the array is transformed by XORing elements at a certain distance.

So for example, to compute the array after s steps:

s = b_0 * 2^0 + b_1 * 2^1 + ... + b_{k} * 2^k

For each bit m where b_m is 1:

   for each i in 0..n-1:

       a[i] = a[i] XOR a[i + 2^m mod n]

This way, the array is transformed in a way that corresponds to applying s steps.

But how to verify this.

Let's take the first example:

n=4, s=2.

Binary representation of s is 10.

So bits m=1.

So apply the transformation for 2^1=2 steps.

For each i in 0..3:

   a[i] = a[i] XOR a[i + 2 mod4]

The original array is [1,2,1,2].

Applying this transformation:

i=0: 1 XOR a[0+2 mod4] = 1 XOR 1 = 0.

i=1: 2 XOR a[1+2 mod4] = 2 XOR 2 = 0.

i=2: 1 XOR a[2+2 mod4] = 1 XOR 1 =0.

i=3: 2 XOR a[3+2 mod4] = 2 XOR 2 =0.

Wait, but this results in all zeros. But according to the example, after 2 steps, the array is zeros. So this approach seems to model the steps correctly.

But how does applying the transformation for 2 steps correspond to this.

In the first example, after two steps:

Step1: [3,3,3,3]

Step2: [0,0,0,0]

But according to the above approach, applying the transformation for m=1 (2^1=2 steps) would XOR each element with the element two positions away. Original array is [1,2,1,2], so:

i=0: 1 XOR 1 =0.

i=1: 2 XOR 2=0.

i=2:1 XOR 1=0.

i=3:2 XOR 2=0.

Which gives the correct result.

So this approach seems to work.

Another example: the third example, n=1, s=1.

Binary representation of s is 1 (2^0). So apply transformation m=0.

i=0: a[0] XOR a[0+1 mod1=0] → 14 XOR 14 =0.

Which is correct.

So the approach is to model each step's bits as applying transformations that XOR each element with the element 2^m positions away. Each bit in the binary representation of s corresponds to such a transformation.

Thus, to compute the array after s steps, we can decompose s into binary digits and apply the corresponding transformations.

Now, the problem reduces to finding the minimal s such that after applying s steps, the array becomes uniform (all elements equal). Then the answer is s+1.

If the array can't be made uniform after any s steps up to a certain limit, then output -1.

But how to find the minimal s.

The approach would be to perform a binary search on s. For each possible s, compute the array after s steps and check if it's uniform. But even binary search would be O(n log s) per check, which for large n is not feasible.

Another approach: since each step is a transformation that can be represented as a bitwise operation, perhaps the array becomes uniform after a certain number of steps which is a sum of powers of two. We can greedily build s by trying to add the largest possible power of two steps that brings us closer to a uniform array.

Thus, the steps are determined by trying powers of two from largest to smallest. For example, for n=8 (log2(n)=3), we try m=3 (8 steps), then m=2 (4 steps), etc.

But how to check if applying a certain power of two steps leads us closer to a uniform array.

An efficient way is to compute the array after each possible power of two steps and check if it's uniform.

But the maximum number of steps to consider is log2(n) steps. For each m in 0 to log2(n), we can apply the transformation for 2^m steps and check if the array is uniform.

Wait, but the minimal s is a sum of some subset of the powers of two. So perhaps the minimal s is the sum of the first few bits that, when applied, make the array uniform.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for the array to become uniform, all elements must be the same after applying certain transformations. This can be checked for each possible power of two steps.

For example, for each m from 0 to log2(n), we can compute the array after applying 2^m steps and check if it's uniform. If any of them is uniform, then the minimal s is the sum of the steps up to that point, plus one.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, the minimal s can be built by adding powers of two steps in reverse order. For example, start with the largest possible step (log2(n) steps), and if applying that step leads to a uniform array, then take that step. Otherwise, proceed to lower steps.

But I'm not sure.

Another observation: For the array to become uniform after s steps, the array must have a certain periodicity. For example, after applying s steps, the array must have a period of n/2^m, where m is the number of steps applied.

Thus, perhaps the minimal s is determined by the maximal possible m such that the array after m steps has a certain periodicity.

But how.

Alternatively, the steps required are the sum of the positions of the least significant set bits in the binary representations of the required steps.

This is getting complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best way to proceed is to implement the transformation using the binary lifting approach. For each power of two steps, we can precompute the array and check for uniformity.

The plan is:

1. Check if the initial array is all zeros. If yes, return 0.

2. Apply the first step (step 1), check if it's zero. If yes, return 1.

3. For each power of two m from 0 to log2(n) -1:

   a. Precompute the array after applying 2^m steps by XORing each element with the element 2^m positions away.

   b. Check if the array is uniform. If yes, return the sum of steps taken so far plus 1.

   c. Otherwise, accumulate the steps.

But how to model the accumulation of steps.

Alternatively, we can greedily try to apply the largest possible steps first.

Here's an outline of the code:

n = given.

a = list of elements.

if all zeros, return 0.

current_steps = 0

for m in reversed(range(log2(n)+1)):

    step = 2^m

    if current_steps + step > log2(n):

        continue

    temp_array = [a[i] ^ a[(i + step) % n] for i in range(n)]

    if all elements in temp_array are equal:

        current_steps += step

        return current_steps + 1

    else:

        a = temp_array

        current_steps += step

return -1

But this is not correct, because applying the steps in this way may not account for the order of steps correctly.

Alternatively, we can precompute all possible step sizes and check after each possible step.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute for each possible step size in increasing order of m, and check if after applying that step size, the array becomes uniform.

But for the code, the following approach may work:

We can try to apply steps for each power of two in reverse order (from largest to smallest) and accumulate the steps. After each step, check if the array is uniform. If it is, then the answer is the accumulated steps plus one.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the number of steps required to reach a uniform array is the sum of certain powers of two. For example, in the fourth example, the steps were 4, which is 2^2.

So after applying 2^2 steps, the array becomes uniform.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

We precompute the array after applying each possible power of two steps. For each m from 0 to log2(n), we compute the array after 2^m steps. If any of these arrays is uniform, then the minimal s is the sum of the steps applied plus one.

But how to model the steps in sequence.

Another approach:

We start with the original array.

For m from 0 to log2(n) - 1:

   create a new array where each element is a[i] ^ a[i + 2^m mod n]

   check if all elements are equal.

   if yes, then the steps required are sum of previous steps plus 2^m, and then +1 for the final step.

   else, update the array to the new array.

This is similar to applying each step of power of two in sequence.

But let's see how this works for the fourth example.

Original array: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

m=0: 2^0=1 step.

new array is:

0^1=1

1^2=3

2^3=1

3^4=7

4^5=1

5^6=3

6^7=1

7^0=7

Array: [1,3,1,7,1,3,1,7] → not uniform.

m=1: 2^1=2 steps.

new array is each element XOR element 2 positions away.

For each i:

a[i] ^ a[i+2 mod 8]

So:

1^1=0

3^7= 4

1^1=0

7^3= 4

1^1=0

3^7=4

1^1=0

7^3=4

Array: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] → not uniform.

m=2: 2^2=4 steps.

new array is each element XOR element 4 positions away.

For each i:

0^0=0

4^0=4

0^0=0

4^0=4

0^0=0

4^0=4

0^0=0

4^0=4

Array: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4] → not uniform.

Wait, this seems incorrect. The previous array was [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]. For m=2 (step=4), each element is XORed with the element 4 positions away.

i=0: 0 XOR 0 (i+4=0+4=4 mod8 → a[4]=0) → 0.

i=1:4 XOR 0 (a[5]=4, a[5+4 mod8=1+4=5 mod8? Wait, no.

Wait, current array after m=1 is [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4].

For m=2, step=4.

For each i, we compute a[i] XOR a[i+4 mod8].

i=0: a[0] XOR a[4] → 0 XOR 0=0.

i=1: a[1] XOR a[5] →4 XOR4=0.

i=2: a[2] XOR a[6] →0 XOR0=0.

i=3: a[3] XOR a[7] →4 XOR4=0.

i=4: a[4] XOR a[0] →0 XOR0=0.

i=5: a[5] XOR a[1] →4 XOR4=0.

i=6: a[6] XOR a[2] →0 XOR0=0.

i=7: a[7] XOR a[3] →4 XOR4=0.

So the array becomes all zeros. But according to the fourth example, after applying 4 steps, the array is uniform. So after step m=2 (4 steps), the array is zero. Which would lead to s=4 steps, and answer is 5. But in this case, the array after m=2 steps is zero, which is uniform. So the code would check for each m whether the array is uniform.

But the code would need to accumulate the steps.

But this approach seems to work. So the code can be structured as follows:

We start with the initial array.

We loop over m from 0 to log2(n) - 1:

   step = 2^m

   create a new array where each element is a[i] XOR a[i + step]

   check if all elements are equal.

   if yes, then the answer is current_steps + step + 1.

   else, update the array to this new array.

   current_steps += step

After all m, if the array is uniform, return current_steps +1. Else, return -1.

But how to track the current_steps.

Let me think for the fourth example:

Initial array: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

current_steps =0.

m=0 (step=1):

new array: [0^1, 1^2, 2^3, 3^4,4^5,5^6,6^7,7^0] → [1,3,1,7,1,3,1,7]

check if uniform → no.

current_steps +=1 → 1.

m=1 (step=2):

new array: each element is a[i] ^ a[i+2]. The current array is [1,3,1,7,1,3,1,7].

So:

i=0:1^1=0

i=1:3^7= 4

i=2:1^1=0

i=3:7^3=4

i=4:1^1=0

i=5:3^7=4

i=6:1^1=0

i=7:7^3=4

new array: [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4]. Check if uniform → no.

current_steps +=2 → 3.

m=2 (step=4):

new array: each element is a[i] ^ a[i+4 mod8].

current array is [0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4].

i=0:0^0=0

i=1:4^4=0

i=2:0^0=0

i=3:4^4=0

i=4:0^0=0

i=5:4^4=0

i=6:0^0=0

i=7:4^4=0.

new array is all zeros. Check if uniform → yes. So current_steps is 3 +4=7, but wait, step is 4, but the steps accumulated so far is 1+2=3. Adding step=4 (2^2) gives current_steps=3+4=7. But the answer is 5 steps.

This suggests that the code is not correctly tracking the steps.

Wait, no. Because the code is trying to apply steps in increasing order. But the steps are applied in the order of m=0, m=1, m=2, etc. Each step represents applying 2^m steps. So the total steps accumulated is 1 + 2 +4 =7. But the answer in the fourth example is 5 steps. So this approach is not correct.

Thus, the problem is that the code is accumulating steps in the wrong way. Because applying m=0 step (1 step) then m=1 step (2 steps) then m=2 step (4 steps) totals 7 steps, but the correct answer is 4 steps (step4) plus one step to make zero, totaling 5 steps.

Thus, this approach is not working.

So perhaps the code should instead try to apply the steps in reverse order, from largest to smallest.

Another plan:

Initialize the array as the initial array.

current_steps =0.

For m in reversed(range(log2(n)+1)):

   step = 2^m.

   if current_steps + step > n:

       continue.

   temp_array = [a[i] ^ a[(i + step) % n] for i in range(n)]

   if temp_array is uniform:

       return current_steps + step +1.

   else:

       a = temp_array

       current_steps += step

After all m, check if the array is uniform. If yes, return current_steps +1. Else, return -1.

Let's test this with the fourth example.

Initial array: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

current_steps=0.

m=3 (step=8, which is n=8. So step=8 mod8=0. Each element is a[i] ^ a[i], which is zero. But applying this step would zero the array. So the array becomes all zeros, which is uniform. So current_steps + step +1 =0+8+1=9, but the correct answer is 5.

This is not correct.

So this approach is also not working.

This suggests that the way we model the steps is incorrect.

Thus, the problem is more complex than previously thought, and the initial approach is not working.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the minimal number of steps s is the number of ones in the binary representation of (n-1). For example, for n=4 (2^2), the steps required are 2. Which is log2(n).

But this is just a guess.

Another observation: in the first example, n=4, steps=2= log2(n) *1.

In the third example, n=1, steps=1=log2(n)+1.

In the fourth example, n=8, steps=5=log2(n) +1. Wait, log2(8)=3. 3+1=4, not 5.

So this is not correct.

Alternatively, the steps required are the position of the highest set bit in (n-1) plus 1.

But not sure.

At this point, given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a pattern in the examples and find a way to model the steps.

Another idea: the minimal steps s is the number of ones in the binary representation of the initial array's elements. But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, the steps required are the minimal such that 2^s >= n.

But this also doesn't fit the examples.

Given that time is limited and I need to provide a solution, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the following steps:

1. Check if the array is already zero. If yes, return 0.

2. Apply the first step. Check if zero. If yes, return 1.

3. For each m in 0 to log2(n):

   a. Compute the array after 2^m steps by XORing each element with the one 2^m steps away.

   b. Check if the array is uniform. If yes, return 2^m steps +1.

4. If no such m exists, return -1.

But this is not working for the fourth example, where the answer is 5 steps.

But according to this approach, after m=2 steps (4 steps), the array is uniform, so return 4+1=5. Which is correct.

So the code can be written as follows:

Check initial array.

For m in 0 to log2(n):

   step = 2^m.

   compute temp array by XORing each element with the one step away.

   if temp array is uniform, return step +1.

But how to compute the array after step=2^m steps.

For example, m=2, step=4.

Then, each element is XORed with the element 4 steps away.

But in the fourth example, after m=2 (step=4), the array becomes uniform.

So:

Original array after applying step=4 steps:

For the fourth example's initial array:

After applying step=4 steps (each element is XORed with the element 4 positions away):

0 ^4 =4

1 ^5 =4

2 ^6 =4

3 ^7 =4

4 ^0 =4

5 ^1 =4

6 ^2 =4

7 ^3 =4.

So the array becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is uniform. So step is 4, return 4+1=5. Which is correct.

Thus, the code should check each power of two step, and for each, compute the array after that step and see if it's uniform. The minimal such step plus one is the answer.

But how to compute the array after each power of two step.

The code can be structured as follows:

Read n and a.

If all zeros: print 0.

Else:

   for m in range(0, log2(n) +1):

       step = 2^m

       temp = [a[i] ^ a[(i+step) %n] for i in range(n)]

       if all elements in temp are the same:

           print(step +1)

           exit

   print(-1)

But this code would not work for the fourth example. Because the step=4 (2^2) leads to the uniform array, and step+1=5 is the answer.

Yes. So this approach would work.

Let's test the fourth example:

The initial array is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

For m=0: step=1.

temp array is [0^1, 1^2, 2^3, 3^4,4^5,5^6,6^7,7^0] → [1,3,1,7,1,3,1,7]. Not uniform.

m=1: step=2.

temp array is [0^2,1^3,2^4,3^5,4^6,5^7,6^0,7^1] → [2, 2, 6,6, 2,2,6,6]. Not uniform.

m=2: step=4.

temp array is [0^4, 1^5, 2^6,3^7,4^0,5^1,6^2,7^3] → [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. All elements are 4. So uniform. So return 4+1=5. Which is correct.

Thus, this approach works.

So the code is:

Check if all elements are zero → return 0.

Else, for each m from 0 to log2(n) inclusive:

   step = 2^m.

   compute temp array where each element is a[i] ^ a[(i+step) %n].

   check if all elements are the same.

   if yes, return step +1.

After checking all m, return -1.

But why does this work?

Because applying step=2^m steps is equivalent to XORing each element with the element 2^m steps away. If this results in a uniform array, then applying one more step would zero the array.

Thus, the minimal s is step+1.

Thus, the code would work.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But first, we need to compute log2(n). Since n is a power of two.

For each m in 0 to log2(n) -1:

   step = 2^m.

But log2(n) can be computed as n.bit_length() -1.

For example, n=8: log2(n)=3.

So m ranges from 0 to 3.

The code:

Read n.

Read the array a.

If all elements are zero: print 0.

Else:

   for m in 0 to (n.bit_length() -1):

       step = 1 << m

       temp = [a[i] ^ a[(i + step) %n] for i in range(n)]

       if all elements in temp are the same:

           print(step +1)

           exit.

   print(-1)

Wait, but for n=1, log2(n) is 0. So m ranges from 0 to 0.

For n=1, step is 1. But (i+step) mod 1 is (0+1) mod1=0. So temp is [a[0]^a[0]] = [0]. Check if all elements are same (yes). So step +1 = 2. But according to the third example, the answer is 1.

Hmm. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, third example: n=1, a=[14].

In the code, the initial array is checked. All elements are not zero. So proceed.

For m=0, step=1.

temp = [14 ^ a[(0+1)%1] → (14 ^14) =0.

Check if all elements are same (yes). So return step+1=1+1=2. But the correct answer is 1.

Thus, the code is incorrect for the third example.

So what's wrong.

The code is based on the assumption that applying step=2^m steps transforms the array into a uniform array, and then applying step+1 steps would zero it. But in the case of n=1, applying step=1 steps (m=0) would transform the array into zero, which is uniform. So step+1=2 steps would be needed. But according to the third example, the answer is 1 step.

Thus, the code is not correct for this case.

This indicates that the code's approach is flawed.

Ah, the problem is that the step=2^m steps is the number of steps taken, but in reality, the step=2^m steps are equivalent to applying the transformation 2^m times. However, for n=1, each step is a transformation of a single element.

For example, for n=1 and step=1 (2^0 steps):

The code computes a[0] ^ a[0] =0. Thus, after one step, the array is zero, which requires one step. But the code returns step+1=2 steps.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect.

The root cause is that the code's approach of checking for step=2^m steps and returning step+1 is not correct for the case when the array becomes zero after step steps. Because in such cases, the required steps are step steps, not step+1.

For example, in the third example, after applying step=1, the array is zero. So the answer is step=1 steps, not step+1=2 steps.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect.

Thus, the correct approach is to check whether the array after step=2^m steps is uniform. If it's uniform, then the answer is step+1 steps only if the uniform array is not zero. If the uniform array is zero, then the answer is step steps.

But how to handle this.

Alternatively, the code should check if the array after step=2^m steps is uniform. If yes, then:

   if the uniform array is zero, the answer is step.

   else, answer is step +1.

But how to check this.

Thus, for each m:

   compute temp array.

   if temp is uniform:

       if all elements are zero:

           return step.

       else:

           return step +1.

But how.

This would require, for each m, to check if temp is uniform and zero.

But this complicates the code.

Thus, the code should first check if the initial array is zero. Then, for each m:

   compute temp array.

   if all elements are zero:

       return step.

   else if all elements are the same (but not zero):

       return step +1.

Thus, the code would handle cases where the array becomes zero after step steps.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Read a.

if all elements are zero: print 0.

else:

   for m in 0 to log2(n):

       step = 1<<m

       temp = [a[i] ^ a[ (i + step) %n ] for i in range(n) ]

       if all elements in temp are zero:

           print(step)

           exit

       elif all elements are the same:

           print(step +1)

           exit

   print(-1)

But this requires checking for both all zero and all same.

Let's test this for the third example:

n=1, a=[14].

initial array is not zero.

For m=0, step=1.

temp = [14^14] → [0].

Check if all elements are zero → yes. So return step=1. Which is correct.

Thus, the code now returns 1 for the third example.

For the fourth example:

For m=2, step=4.

temp is [0^4,1^5,2^6,3^7,4^0,5^1,6^2,7^3] → [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. All elements are same but not zero. So return step+1=4+1=5. Which is correct.

Another example: the first example, after step=2 (m=1), temp array is [0,0,0,0]. So return step=2.

But in the first example, the steps required is 2.

Yes. The code returns 2.

Another example: initial array is all zero. return 0.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

So the code now:

- First checks if the array is all zero.

- Else, for each m in 0 to log2(n), compute step=2^m.

- For each step, compute temp array as XOR of each element with element step away.

- If temp is all zero, return step.

- Else, if temp is all same (but not zero), return step +1.

- After checking all m, return -1.

Thus, the code should correctly handle all cases.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But how to compute log2(n) for the loop.

Given that n is a power of two, the loop should run for m from 0 to log2(n).

For example, n=8 (2^3) → m from 0 to 3.

Thus, the loop would run for m in 0 to (n.bit_length() -1) -1. Wait, n.bit_length() for 8 is 4. So 4-1=3. So m in 0 to 3.

Thus, the code:
