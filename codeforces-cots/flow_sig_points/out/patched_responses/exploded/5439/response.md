<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where the hunter can shoot ducks by timing his shots. The goal is to find the maximum number of ducks he can hit, given that each shot must be at least r seconds apart, and he can't shoot before time 0.

Hmm. The problem says each duck is a horizontal segment moving left (since the x decreases by 1 per second). At the moment of a shot, any duck that is covering the Oy axis (x=0) at that time will be hit. So for each duck, I need to find the time intervals during which at least part of its body is at x=0. Then, the hunter can choose a set of times (each at least r apart, starting from time >=0) such that each time hits as many ducks as possible, but each duck can be hit only once.

Wait, but how do the ducks' positions change over time? Let's think. For a duck i, at time t, the head's x-coordinate is hi - t (since it's moving left at 1 unit per second). The tail's x is ti - t. Wait no, wait: the problem says the duck is moving in the negative Ox direction. So the entire segment moves to the left. So, for example, if a duck's head is at hi at time 0, then at time t, it's at hi - t? Because moving left (negative direction) by 1 unit per second. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, when the duck is moving left, each point on the segment decreases by t in x-coordinate. So for a duck with head hi and tail ti (hi < ti) at time 0, at time t, the head is at hi - t, tail at ti - t. But since the duck is moving left, the entire segment is shifting left.

So the duck's position over time is a segment [hi - t, ti - t]. For the hunter's shot at time s, this segment must contain 0. So we need 0 to be between hi - s and ti - s. Wait, but since hi < ti (as per input), after moving left, the head is hi - s, and the tail is ti - s. So the segment is [hi - s, ti - s], but since hi < ti, this is a valid interval. So for the duck to be hit at time s, 0 must lie within [hi - s, ti - s]. 

Rearranging that inequality: hi - s <= 0 <= ti - s. 

Adding s to all parts: hi <= s <= ti. 

So s must be >= hi and s <= ti. So the time interval when the duck is over the Oy axis is [hi, ti]. Because for s >= hi and s <= ti, the duck's segment covers x=0. 

Ah, that's a crucial insight. So each duck i has a time window [hi, ti], and the hunter must shoot during that window. But the hunter can't shoot before time 0. So the actual available window for the duck is [max(hi, 0), ti]. Because if hi is negative, the earliest time the hunter can shoot is 0, and then the duck's window ends at ti. So for each duck, the valid shooting time is [a_i, b_i], where a_i = max(hi, 0) and b_i = ti.

But wait, the problem says that the hunter can't make shots before time 0. So even if a duck's window starts at hi <0, the hunter can't shoot during that. So the actual available interval for the duck is [max(hi,0), ti]. But if ti < max(hi, 0), then the duck is never available. For example, if hi is -5 and ti is -3. Then at time 0, the duck's segment is at [-5 -0, -3 -0] = [-5, -3], which is all left of 0. So it's not hit. But if ti is 2, then the window is [max(-5,0), 2] → [0,2]. So the duck can be shot between time 0 and 2.

So for each duck, we compute a_i = max(hi, 0) and b_i = ti. Then, the duck's interval is [a_i, b_i]. However, if a_i > b_i, then the duck cannot be hit at all, so we can ignore such ducks.

So first step: filter out any ducks where a_i > b_i, as they can't be hit.

Now, the problem reduces to selecting a set of time points s_1, s_2, ..., s_k such that each s_j is >=0, s_{j+1} >= s_j + r, and each s_j lies within at least one duck's interval [a_i, b_i]. Each duck can be hit at most once. We need to maximize the number of ducks hit.

But how do we model this? Because each duck can be hit in any of the time points s_j that lie in its interval, but each duck can be assigned to exactly one s_j.

So this is similar to interval scheduling, but with the twist that the selected time points must be spaced at least r apart, and each time point can hit any number of ducks whose intervals include it, but each duck can be hit only once.

The challenge is to choose the times in such a way that as many ducks as possible are covered by the chosen times, considering the spacing requirement.

So the optimal approach would be to select the earliest possible times that allow covering as many ducks as possible, considering the constraints.

But how to model this? Let's think of it as a greedy problem. The idea is to sort the ducks' intervals in a certain way and select the earliest possible shooting times that can hit them, ensuring that each shot is at least r seconds after the previous.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to process the ducks in the order of their latest possible shooting time (b_i) and assign them to the earliest possible shot that is within their interval and after the previous shot plus r.

Wait, this sounds like the classic interval greedy algorithm. For example, in interval scheduling where you want to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. The optimal approach there is to select the interval that ends earliest, then the next one that starts after the previous ends, etc.

But in our case, the 'shots' are time points that must be spaced at least r apart. Each shot can hit any number of ducks whose intervals include that time. But each duck can be hit only once, so each duck must be assigned to exactly one shot time.

So the problem is to select a set of shot times, each at least r apart, such that each duck's [a_i, b_i] interval contains at least one of these shot times. We want the maximum number of ducks that can be covered.

Wait, but each duck can be covered exactly once, but a single shot can cover multiple ducks. So the problem is to maximize the number of ducks whose intervals contain at least one of the shot times (which are spaced at least r apart).

So the problem is equivalent to: schedule shot times s_1, s_2, ..., s_k such that s_{j+1} >= s_j + r, and each s_j is in [a_i, b_i] for some ducks i, and the total number of such ducks is maximized.

But each duck can be covered by any shot time that is in their interval. So the optimal solution is to choose the shot times such that each shot covers as many ducks as possible, but considering that once a shot is chosen, the next must be at least r after.

But how to model this? It's similar to interval covering, but with multiple points (shots) allowed, each spaced by at least r, and each point can cover any intervals that contain it.

The problem is similar to the following: find a set of points (shots) such that each point is covered by at least one interval (duck's [a_i, b_i]), and the points are spaced at least r apart, and the total number of covered intervals is maximized.

This seems like a problem that can be addressed with a greedy approach. Let's think: perhaps we can process the ducks in order of their b_i (earliest to latest), and assign the latest possible shot time that can hit them, ensuring that the next shot is at least r away.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to sort the ducks by their a_i and then greedily select the earliest possible shot times.

Wait, but this might not be efficient. Let's think through examples.

Take the first sample input:

3 3
-3 0 → a_i = 0, b_i=0
1 3 → a_i=1, b_i=3
-1 2 → a_i=0, b_i=2

So the intervals are [0,0], [1,3], [0,2].

The optimal shot times are 0 and 3. At 0, the first and third ducks are hit. At 3, the second is hit. So total 3.

So how did the selection work? The first shot is at 0 (earliest possible for the first and third ducks). Then next shot is at 3 (the earliest possible after 0 + 3 =3), which hits the second duck's interval [1,3], since 3 is the upper end.

Alternatively, if we process the ducks in order of their b_i, then for the earliest ending intervals, we can assign the latest possible shot.

Another approach is to model each duck as an interval [a_i, b_i], and find the minimal number of points (shots) such that each shot is at least r apart, and each point is within at least one interval. The goal is to maximize the number of intervals covered.

But this is not exactly the same as interval covering. It's more like scheduling shots to hit as many intervals as possible, with constraints on the shot times.

So the problem is to select a set of shot times s_1, s_2, ..., s_k such that:

s_j+1 >= s_j + r

Each s_j is in at least one [a_i, b_i]

Each [a_i, b_i] can be covered by at most one s_j.

We need to maximize the number of [a_i, b_i] intervals that are covered.

This is similar to the interval covering problem but with the shots spaced by at least r, and each interval can be covered by at most one shot.

An optimal approach would be to select shots in such a way that each shot is placed as late as possible within the intervals, allowing more flexibility for future shots. Or perhaps as early as possible, to allow more shots.

Alternatively, we can model this as scheduling shots where each shot is placed in some interval, and each subsequent shot is placed after r time.

Let's think of the ducks sorted by their end times b_i. Then, for each duck in order, we can assign the latest possible shot time that is within their [a_i, b_i], and also after the previous shot time plus r. If such a time exists, we take it, otherwise the duck can't be shot.

This approach is similar to the greedy algorithm for interval scheduling where you pick the earliest end time to maximize the number of non-overlapping intervals.

Let's see how this would work with the first sample. Ducks sorted by b_i:

Duck 1: b_i=0, [0,0]

Duck 3: b_i=2, [0,2]

Duck 2: b_i=3, [1,3]

Processing in this order:

First duck (b=0): latest possible time is 0. Assign s=0. Next shot must be >=0 +3 =3.

Second duck (b=2): the latest possible time is 2. But 2 <3, so can't assign. So this duck can't be shot. Wait, but in the sample, the third duck's interval is [0,2]. So the shot at 0 is already in this interval, but the sample says that the third duck is hit by that shot. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, maybe the issue is that when we process the ducks in order of their b_i, we assign the latest possible shot for each, but if a duck can be covered by an earlier shot, we should do that.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to sort the ducks by their a_i and then assign the earliest possible shot, but that also might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps we should process the ducks sorted by their a_i in increasing order, and for each, assign the earliest possible shot that is within their interval and after the previous shot plus r. That way, we can fit as many ducks as possible.

Let's see. For the first sample, the ducks sorted by a_i (then by b_i):

Duck1: a_i=0, b_i=0.

Duck3: a_i=0, b_i=2.

Duck2: a_i=1, b_i=3.

Processing in this order:

First shot: earliest possible is 0. Assign to duck1 and duck3. Then next shot must be >=0+3=3.

Processing duck2: their interval is [1,3]. The earliest possible shot after 0+3 is 3. Check if 3 is within [1,3]. Yes. Assign to 3. So total 3 ducks.

Which matches the sample.

Another example: the second sample.

Input:

4 5

-1 1 → a_i=0, b_i=1.

2 4 → a_i=2, b_i=4.

5 9 → a_i=5, b_i=9.

6 8 → a_i=6, b_i=8.

So the intervals are [0,1], [2,4], [5,9], [6,8].

Sample output is 3.

The explanation says shots at 0 and 6.

So first shot at 0 (covers first duck), next shot at 6 (covers third and fourth ducks). But the second duck's interval is [2,4], which is between 0 and 6. But since r=5, the next shot after 0 must be >=5. The first possible shot after 0 is 5, but 5 is within [2,4]? No. 5>4, so no. So the second duck cannot be covered. The third and fourth can be covered by a shot at 5 (third's interval is [5,9]) but then next shot is 5+5=10, which may cover another duck.

Wait, but in the sample, the optimal is 3. The possible shots are 0 (covers first duck), then 6 (covers third and fourth). That's two shots, covering three ducks. So the sample's output is 3.

So how does the greedy approach work here when sorted by a_i.

Processing in order of a_i:

Ducks sorted by a_i: first interval [0,1], then [2,4], [5,9], [6,8].

First shot is earliest possible (0). Assign to first duck. Next shot can be at 5 (since 0+5=5). Check the next ducks.

The second duck's interval is [2,4]. 5 is after 4, so can't be covered. So second duck is not covered.

Third duck's interval [5,9]. The earliest shot possible after 0 is 5. Assign shot at 5. Covers third duck. Next shot can be 10.

Fourth duck's interval [6,8]. 5 is before 6. So the earliest possible shot is 6 (since 5+5=10, but 10 is after 8. So no. Wait, but the shot at 5 is in the third duck's interval. The fourth duck's interval is [6,8]. The next shot after 5 must be at least 5+5=10. 10>8, so the fourth duck can't be hit. So the only ducks covered are first and third, but the sample output is 3. So this approach would fail.

Wait, so what's the problem here. Ah, because the shot at 6 can cover the fourth duck and third duck. But if the shot is at 6, which is in both intervals. So the third duck's interval is [5,9], which includes 6. So if we assign the third and fourth ducks to a shot at 6, then it's possible.

So the approach of processing ducks in a_i order and assigning the earliest possible shot may miss this. Because when the third duck is processed, the earliest possible shot is 5 (since previous shot is 0, next is 0+5=5). But if the shot is at 5, then the fourth duck's interval is [6,8], which starts after 5. But the next shot is 10, which is after 8. So the fourth duck is not covered. However, if the shot for the third and fourth ducks is at 6, which is allowed if the previous shot was at 0 and the next is 0 +5 =5. Wait, no. Because the previous shot is at 0, the next shot must be at least 0 +5 =5. So 6 is allowed. Because 6 >=5. So if we process the third duck, the earliest possible shot is 5, but if we can place the shot at 6 (which is also allowed, as it's >=5), then the fourth duck's interval [6,8] can also be covered.

So the question is, when processing a duck, should we choose the earliest possible time (to allow more ducks later) or a later time (to cover more ducks in this shot)?

This suggests that the optimal strategy is to process the ducks in a certain order and assign the shot time as the latest possible within their interval that is after the last shot plus r and as early as possible. Or maybe to process ducks in order of their end times (b_i), so that we can assign the latest possible time in their interval that is compatible with the previous shots.

Wait, let's try the following approach:

Sort all the ducks by their b_i in increasing order.

Then, for each duck in this order, if the latest possible shot time (which is min(b_i, ...)) that is >= a_i and >= (last_shot_time + r) is possible, then assign that shot time to this duck. This way, we're placing the shot as late as possible for each duck, which leaves as much room as possible for earlier ducks (since they are processed first). But no, since the ducks are sorted by b_i, the ones with earlier ends are processed first.

So here's the algorithm:

Initialize last_shot_time = -infinity (or a very small number).

Sort the ducks by b_i in increasing order.

For each duck in this order:

   current_shot_time = max(a_i, last_shot_time + r)

   if current_shot_time <= b_i:

       assign a shot at current_shot_time. This duck is counted.

       last_shot_time = current_shot_time

   else:

       skip this duck.

This approach ensures that each shot is scheduled as early as possible after the previous shot plus r, but within the current duck's interval. By processing ducks in order of their b_i, we prioritize ducks that end earlier, which allows more flexibility for later ducks (with later b_i) to be scheduled.

Let's test this approach against the first sample.

Sample 1:

Ducks sorted by b_i:

Duck1: [0,0]

Duck3: [0,2]

Duck2: [1,3]

Processing:

last_shot = -infty.

First duck: a_i=0, b_i=0.

current_shot_time = max(0, -infty +3) → 0.

Since 0 <=0 → assign. count=1. last_shot=0.

Second duck (duck3): a_i=0, b_i=2.

current_shot_time = max(0, 0 +3=3). So 3. But 3 >2 → can't assign. So duck3 is not counted.

Third duck (duck2): a_i=1, b_i=3.

current_shot_time = max(1, 0+3=3) →3. 3 <=3 → assign. count=2. last_shot=3.

Total count 2. But sample expects 3. So this approach doesn't work. So something's wrong.

Wait, in the sample, the first shot at 0 covers ducks 1 and 3. But in this approach, when we process the first duck (sorted by b_i), we assign a shot at 0. Then, when processing the second duck (duck3), the current_shot_time is 0+3=3, which is beyond duck3's b_i=2. So duck3 is not counted. But in reality, the first shot can cover both ducks 1 and 3. So the problem is that the algorithm only counts one duck per shot, but each shot can hit multiple ducks. However, the algorithm is counting each duck individually, but the shots can cover multiple ducks.

Ah, here's the crux of the problem. The algorithm I considered is designed to select one duck per shot, but in reality, each shot can hit multiple ducks. So the previous approach is not correct.

So the key is that a single shot can hit multiple ducks, and we need to assign as many ducks as possible to each shot, as long as their intervals include the shot time. But each duck can be assigned to exactly one shot, and the shots must be at least r apart.

Therefore, the problem is to select a set of shot times such that each shot time is in the [a_i, b_i] of the ducks that are assigned to it, and the shot times are spaced at least r apart, and the total number of ducks is maximized.

The challenge is to model this as a problem where each duck can be covered by any shot time in its interval, and the shots are spaced sufficiently. The optimal approach would be to arrange the shot times to cover as many ducks as possible, with the minimal number of shots (so that more ducks can be covered by each shot).

So perhaps the optimal approach is to schedule shot times such that each shot covers as many ducks as possible, and each subsequent shot is scheduled after the previous one plus r.

But how to find such a schedule efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model this as an interval graph, where each shot is a point, and there is an edge between a duck and a shot if the shot is in the duck's interval. We need to select a set of points (shots) such that each shot is at least r apart, and each duck is connected to exactly one shot, and the total number of ducks is maximized.

But this is a problem that is likely NP-hard, so we need an efficient approach.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to model this?

Let's think about the ducks. For a duck to be hit, it must have at least one shot time s in its interval [a_i, b_i], and s must be >= previous shot + r (if there is a previous shot), and so on.

So the problem reduces to selecting a set of shot times s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_k, where s_j+1 >= s_j + r, such that for each s_j, there are as many ducks as possible whose [a_i, b_i] intervals include s_j. However, each duck can be assigned to at most one s_j.

Thus, the problem is similar to hitting set selection where each shot is a point, and the shots must be spaced at least r apart, and each duck is hit by at least one shot. The goal is to maximize the number of ducks hit.

But hitting set is NP-hard, so we need a greedy approach here.

Given that the constraints are up to 2e5 ducks, we need an O(n log n) algorithm.

Let's think differently: for each possible shot time s, what is the maximum number of ducks that can be hit if we choose to shoot at s, given the previous shots.

But even that approach is not straightforward.

Alternative idea: Since each shot can cover multiple ducks, perhaps the best approach is to find a set of non-overlapping time intervals (each of length r, spaced r apart) such that each interval contains as many duck intervals as possible. Wait, but the shots are points, not intervals. Hmm.

Alternatively, the shots can be considered as points, and the spacing between them must be >=r. So the first shot can be at s_1, then s_2 >= s_1 + r, s_3 >= s_2 + r, etc.

The optimal set of shots would be such that each shot is placed in a region where as many ducks' intervals as possible are present, and the shots are spaced r apart.

But how to model this?

Another approach: Since the ducks are sorted by their a_i and b_i, perhaps the optimal shot times can be chosen in a way that each shot is as late as possible within a certain window, allowing the next shot to be after r time.

Let me think of the ducks sorted by their b_i. Then, the first shot should be placed at the earliest possible to cover as many ducks as possible. But perhaps the optimal is to place the first shot as late as possible to cover a group of ducks, then the next shot after r time, etc.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the interval covering problem:

Sort the ducks by their b_i in ascending order. Then, process each duck in order. For each duck, if it can be covered by the last shot time (i.e., the last shot time is within its [a_i, b_i]), then do nothing. Otherwise, schedule a new shot at min(b_i, a_i + r) or something. Wait, perhaps schedule a new shot at the earliest possible time that can cover this duck and as many subsequent ducks as possible.

Alternatively, for the ducks sorted by a_i and b_i, here's a possible approach:

Sort the ducks by their b_i in ascending order.

Initialize last_shot = -infinity.

For each duck in order:

   if the duck's a_i <= last_shot + r <= b_i: then it's already covered. do nothing.

   else:

       schedule a new shot at the earliest possible time s that is >= last_shot + r and within [a_i, b_i]. If such a s exists, set last_shot to s.

But this would allow each shot to cover multiple ducks.

Wait, let's see how this works.

Sample 1:

Ducks sorted by b_i: 0, 2, 3.

last_shot = -infty.

First duck: a_i=0, b_i=0.

The earliest possible s is max(0, -infty + r=3) → 0. But 0 is within [0,0]. So schedule s=0. last_shot=0.

Second duck: a_i=0, b_i=2.

Check if 0 +3=3 is within [0,2]. No. So need to schedule a new shot. The earliest possible s is max(0, 0+3=3) → 3. But 3>2, so no. So can't schedule. So this duck is not covered.

Third duck: a_i=1, b_i=3.

Earliest possible s is max(1, 0+3=3). 3 is <=3. So schedule s=3. last_shot=3. So this duck is covered.

Total ducks covered: 1 (duck1) and 1 (duck3) → total 2. But sample expects 3. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, because in the sample, the first shot covers both duck1 and duck3 (their intervals include 0). But this approach is processing each duck individually and only counts them if they are covered by some shot. However, the approach is considering each duck in order, and when a shot is scheduled, it may cover subsequent ducks. But in the code above, once a shot is scheduled, the next ducks are only considered if their a_i <= last_shot <= b_i. But in the first sample, after scheduling s=0, the third duck (which has a_i=0, b_i=2) would be covered by s=0. But in the code above, since we process the ducks in order of b_i, after the first shot, when we process the second duck (third duck in the sample?), the code checks if 0 is within its interval, which it is. So why isn't it counted?

Wait, the code's logic is: for each duck in order, if it's already covered by the last shot, do nothing. So in the first sample, after scheduling the first shot (s=0), the second duck (third in original input?) has a_i=0, b_i=2. The code checks if 0 is within [0,2], which it is. So the code counts this duck as covered. Then, the third duck (second in the input) has a_i=1, b_i=3. The code checks if 0 is within [1,3]. It's not. So then the code tries to schedule a new shot at max(1, 0+3=3), which is 3. 3 is within [1,3], so schedule it. So the code would count two ducks (first and third) plus the third duck (second in input?), leading to a total of 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the ducks sorted by b_i.

Original sample 1:

Duck1: hi=-3, ti=0 → a_i=0, b_i=0.

Duck2: hi=1, ti=3 → a_i=1, b_i=3.

Duck3: hi=-1, ti=2 → a_i=0, b_i=2.

So the ducks sorted by b_i are:

Duck1 (b=0), Duck3 (b=2), Duck2 (b=3).

Processing in that order.

last_shot = -infty.

First duck (duck1) → s=0. Counts as covered.

Second duck (duck3) → a_i=0, b_i=2. last_shot is 0. Check if 0 is within [0, 2]. Yes. So duck3 is covered. No new shot needed.

Third duck (duck2) → a_i=1, b_i=3. Check if 0 is within [1,3]. No. So need to schedule a new shot. Earliest possible s is max(1, 0+3=3) → 3. 3 is within [1,3]. So schedule s=3. Count duck2. Total 3 ducks.

Yes! So the code would count all three ducks.

So how does the code work?

The code is as follows:

Sort ducks by b_i in ascending order.

Initialize last_shot = -infinity.

For each duck in this order:

   if last_shot is not -infinity and last_shot >= a_i and last_shot <= b_i:

       count +=1 (this duck is covered by the previous shot)

   else:

       possible_s = max(a_i, last_shot + r)

       if possible_s <= b_i:

           schedule a new shot at possible_s.

           last_shot = possible_s

           count +=1

       else:

           skip this duck.

So this approach will allow a single shot to cover multiple ducks. The key is that when we process a duck, if it can be covered by the last shot, we count it. Otherwise, we try to schedule a new shot. By processing the ducks in order of increasing b_i, we can cover as many as possible with earlier shots.

This seems like the correct approach.

Let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

After sorting by b_i: 0, 2, 3.

Duck1 (b=0): last_shot is -infty. So possible_s = max(0, -infty +3) →0. which is <=0. So schedule. count=1. last_shot=0.

Duck3 (b=2): check if 0 >=0 and <=2 → yes. count +=1 → total 2.

Duck2 (b=3): check if 0 >=1 (a_i=1) → no. So possible_s = max(1, 0+3=3) →3. 3 <=3. Schedule. count=3. last_shot=3.

So total 3. Correct.

Sample 2:

Input:

4 5

-1 1 → a_i=0, b_i=1.

2 4 → a_i=2, b_i=4.

5 9 → a_i=5, b_i=9.

6 8 → a_i=6, b_i=8.

Sorted by b_i: 1,4,8,9.

Processing:

Duck1 (b=1): a=0. possible_s = max(0, -infty +5) →0. 0 <=1 → schedule. count=1. last_shot=0.

Duck2 (b=4): check if 0 >=2 → no. possible_s = max(2, 0+5=5). 5>4 → no. So can't schedule. count remains 1.

Duck3 (b=8): a_i=6. possible_s = max(6, 0+5=5) →6. 6 <=8. Schedule. count=2. last_shot=6.

Duck4 (b=9): check if 6 >=5 (a_i=5) and <=9 → yes. So count=3.

Total of 3 ducks. Which matches the sample.

So this approach works for both samples.

The algorithm steps are:

1. Filter out ducks where a_i > b_i (can't be hit).

2. Sort the remaining ducks by their b_i in ascending order.

3. Iterate through each duck in this order:

   a. If the last_shot is within the duck's [a_i, b_i], increment the count.

   b. Else, compute the earliest possible shot time (max(a_i, last_shot + r)), and if this time is <= b_i, schedule it and update last_shot.

This way, each duck is processed in order of their end time, and the algorithm greedily schedules shots as late as possible within their intervals, allowing earlier ducks to be covered by previous shots.

The sorting step is O(n log n), and the processing is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

So the steps for the code:

- Read n and r.

- For each of the n ducks, compute a_i = max(hi, 0), b_i = ti. If a_i > b_i, discard the duck.

- Sort the remaining ducks by b_i in ascending order.

- Initialize last_shot = -infinity, count=0.

- For each duck in the sorted list:

   if last_shot >= a_i and last_shot <= b_i:

       count +=1

   else:

       possible_s = max(a_i, last_shot + r)

       if possible_s <= b_i:

           count +=1

           last_shot = possible_s

       else:

           pass

So this is the plan.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

Handling the input:

We read n and r.

Then, for each of n lines, read hi and ti.

Compute a_i = max(hi, 0), b_i = ti.

If a_i > b_i: skip this duck.

Else, add (a_i, b_i) to the list.

Sort the list by b_i.

Then, process as per the algorithm.

Edge cases to consider:

- Ducks with a_i = b_i (like the first sample's duck1).

- Ducks whose possible_s is exactly a_i, which is allowed.

- Ducks with a_i = last_shot + r.

Now, the code:

Read input, filter and process.

But for large n (up to 2e5), we need to read input efficiently.

In Python, using sys.stdin to read is faster. So:

import sys

n, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

ducks = []

for _ in range(n):

    hi, ti = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    a = max(hi, 0)

    if a > ti:

        continue

    ducks.append( (a, ti) )

Then, sort the ducks by their ti.

ducks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

Then, process as per the algorithm.

Initialize last_shot to -infinity (but possible_s is computed as max(a_i, last_shot + r). So for the first duck, possible_s will be max(a_i, -infinity + r) → a_i, but since -infinity + r is negative, max(a_i, ...) is a_i.

count =0

last_shot = -float('inf')

for a, b in ducks:

    if last_shot >= a and last_shot <= b:

        count +=1

    else:

        possible_s = max(a, last_shot + r)

        if possible_s <= b:

            count +=1

            last_shot = possible_s

print(count)

This should work.

Testing this code against the samples:

Sample 1:

After filtering and sorting, the ducks are:

(0,0), (0,2), (1,3)

Wait no, wait:

Original ducks in sample1:

Duck1: hi=-3, ti=0 → a_i=0, b_i=0.

Duck2: hi=1, ti=3 → a_i=1, b_i=3.

Duck3: hi=-1, ti=2 → a_i=0, b_i=2.

So after filtering, all three ducks are valid.

Sorted by b_i: 0, 2, 3.

So the list is [(0,0), (0,2), (1,3)].

Processing:

First duck: a=0, b=0.

possible_s = max(0, -inf +3) →0. possible_s <=0 → yes. count=1. last_shot=0.

Second duck: a=0, b=2.

last_shot is 0. Check if 0 >=0 and <=2 → yes. count=2.

Third duck: a=1, b=3.

Check if 0 >=1 → no. possible_s = max(1, 0+3=3). 3 <=3. count=3. last_shot=3.

So code returns 3. Correct.

Sample 2:

Input:

4 5

-1 1 → a=0, b=1.

2 4 → a=2, b=4.

5 9 → a=5, b=9.

6 8 → a=6, b=8.

Filtered and sorted by b_i:

First duck (0,1), then (2,4), then (6,8), then (5,9). Wait, no:

Wait, ducks after filtering:

All four ducks are valid.

Their b_i are 1,4,9,8. So sorted by b_i:

1 → (0,1)

4 → (2,4)

8 → (6,8)

9 → (5,9).

So the list is [(0,1), (2,4), (6,8), (5,9)].

Processing:

First duck: a=0, b=1.

possible_s = max(0, -inf +5) →0. <=1 → yes. count=1. last_shot=0.

Second duck (2,4): possible_s is max(2,0+5=5). 5>4 → no. So no count.

Third duck (6,8): possible_s is max(6,0+5=5) →6. <=8 → yes. count=2. last_shot=6.

Fourth duck (5,9): Check if 6 >=5 and <=9 → yes. count=3.

So code returns 3. Correct.

Another test case: when a duck's a_i is hi=5, ti=5. Then, possible_s =5. Which is allowed.

So this code seems correct.

Thus, the code should work.
