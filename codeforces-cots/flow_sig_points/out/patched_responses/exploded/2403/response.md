Okay, let's see. I need to find the smallest possible number by pressing the two buttons in any order. The buttons are: add 1 to all digits (mod 10, since 9 becomes 0), and shift all digits right (so last becomes first). 

Hmm. The challenge is to consider all possible sequences of these operations and find the minimal resulting number. But trying all possible sequences would be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 1000. So I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the operations. The two operations can be applied in any order. For example, pressing the add button multiple times is equivalent to adding the number of presses modulo 10. Because adding 1 ten times brings you back to the original. So, for the add operations, the total added is some value between 0 and 9, since adding 10 times is the same as nothing.

The shift operation can be applied any number of times. But shifting n times brings the digits back to the original position. So for the shift, the possible shifts are from 0 to n-1 times. So for each possible shift (rotating right by k positions), we can consider each possible add count (0-9), apply the add to all digits, then see what the resulting number is, and track the minimum.

Wait, because the order might matter. For example, if you shift first then add, or add first then shift. But I think that applying a shift after adding is the same as adding first, then shifting. Because adding changes each digit, then shifting just rearranges their positions. Similarly, adding after shifting would be shifting the digits, then adding 1 to each. So the order between shift and add matters. But since we can apply the operations in any order, perhaps the minimal number can be achieved by first performing all shifts (i.e., rotating the digits in some way) and then adding a certain number of times. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, for example: suppose I shift the digits right once, then add 1. That's equivalent to rotating first, then adding. Alternatively, if I add 1 first, then shift. Which would be different. So the order of shift and add operations affects the result. Therefore, for each possible rotation (shift count), and for each possible add count (0-9), I need to compute the result of adding the add count to all digits of the rotated array, and find the minimal such result.

But how can I model all possible combinations of shifts and adds? Because the problem allows pressing the buttons in any order. For example, maybe you can shift, then add, then shift again, then add again. But the total effect of multiple shifts and adds can be represented as a combination of a single shift and a single add. Let me think.

Let's model the possible transformations. Let's denote:

- The shift operation (right rotation by 1) as S. Applying S k times gives a right rotation by k positions.
- The add operation (adding 1 to all digits) as A. Applying A m times adds m to each digit modulo 10.

But since the operations can be interleaved, how do combinations of S and A affect the digits?

Wait, let's see. Suppose you have a sequence like A followed by S. Then the digits are first all increased by 1, then rotated. Alternatively, if you first S then A, the digits are rotated, then increased. These two are different. So the order matters. So applying S followed by A is not the same as A followed by S.

But if you have a sequence that includes multiple shifts and adds, can it be simplified to a single shift followed by a single add (or vice versa)? For example:

Suppose you have S followed by A followed by S again. That would be equivalent to shifting once, then adding, then shifting again. Which is equivalent to shifting twice (since shifting once and then again is shifting twice), and adding after the first shift. But when you shift again after adding, the add affects the digits in their new positions. Hmm, this seems complicated.

But perhaps the minimal possible number can be obtained by first rotating the digits in some way (i.e., applying a certain number of shifts) and then adding a certain number of times. Because adding after the rotation would add to each digit in the rotated array. Alternatively, perhaps adding first and then rotating. So for all possible rotations (k shifts) and all possible adds (m times), we can compute the possible combinations and find the minimal.

But since the problem allows any order, perhaps the minimal is the same as considering all possible combinations of k shifts and m adds, in any order. However, that's a lot of possibilities. So for each possible rotation (k from 0 to n-1), and each possible add count (m from 0 to 9), we can compute the digits after rotating by k positions and then adding m to each digit. Then, for each of these possibilities, compute the minimal number.

Wait, but what about the other order? For example, adding m and then shifting k times. But that would be equivalent to shifting k times first (since shifting after adding m would result in the same digits as shifting first and then adding m, but in a different order). For example:

Original digits: a, b, c.

If you shift once (S), then digits become c, a, b. Then add m: (c+m), (a+m), (b+m).

Alternatively, add m first: (a+m), (b+m), (c+m). Then shift once: (c+m), (a+m), (b+m). Which is the same as the first scenario. So S followed by A is the same as A followed by S. Wait, no. Because in this case, shifting after adding gives the same result as adding after shifting. So the order between a shift and an add does not affect the result. Therefore, any combination of shifts and adds can be represented as first performing all shifts (i.e., choosing the rotation) and then performing all adds (i.e., adding m to each digit). Because the order between a shift and an add doesn't matter.

Wait, no. Let me see. Let's take a simple example. Suppose original digits are 1, 2.

If I first add 1 (digits become 2,3) then shift right (3,2). Then adding 1 again (4,3). Then shift (3,4). 

Alternatively, shifting first (2,1), add 1 (3,2), shift again (2,3), add 1 (3,4). The result is the same. So perhaps the order of shifts and adds can be reordered as shifts first, then adds. Because each add affects the current digits, which after shifts would have their positions changed. Hmm, perhaps this is not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the minimal is achieved by considering all possible rotations (k shifts) and all possible add values (m), and for each combination, compute the rotated digits, add m to each, and take the minimal. Because any sequence of shifts and adds can be considered as a rotation followed by adding m, where m is the total number of adds. But wait, because adding m times adds 1 each time, so m can be from 0 to 9, since adding 10 times is the same as adding 0.

Wait, but for example: adding once, then shifting, then adding once. That would be equivalent to adding twice (but if the shift is between adds, how does that affect the digits). Let's see:

Original digits: 00. Add once (11), shift right (11), add once (22). So total m is 2. Alternatively, shifting first (00), adding twice (22). Same result. So in this case, the order of shifts and adds didn't matter. But if the shift is done in between adds, but the total adds are 2, then the result is the same as shifting first and then adding 2.

But what if after the first add, the shift is done, then another add. Like:

Original digits: 1, 2. Add once (2,3), shift (3,2), add once (4,3). So total add m=2. If we first shift (2,1), then add 2, we get (4, 3). Which is the same as the original sequence. So in this case, the order didn't matter.

So perhaps the conclusion is that the total add m (mod 10) is additive regardless of the order, and the shifts can be applied first, followed by the adds. Because applying a shift and then an add is equivalent to adding first then shifting. So the order between the shift and the add can be swapped, leading to the same result.

Wait, no. Let's test that. Suppose we have two operations: shift once (S), then add once (A). Let's compare this to adding once then shifting once.

Original digits: a b c d.

Case 1: S then A. 

After S: d a b c. Then add 1: (d+1) (a+1) (b+1) (c+1).

Case 2: A then S.

After A: a+1, b+1, c+1, d+1. Then S: d+1, a+1, b+1, c+1.

These are the same as case 1. So in this case, the order doesn't matter. So S followed by A is the same as A followed by S. So shifting and adding are commutative operations. Therefore, any combination of shifts and adds can be reordered into first shifts (any number) then adds (any number). Therefore, the total effect is equivalent to some number of shifts (k) followed by some number of adds (m). 

Since shifting k times is equivalent to rotating right k times (since each shift is a right rotation by 1). Then, adding m times. So all possible transformations can be represented by a rotation (k) and an add (m). 

Therefore, the minimal number can be found by considering all possible k (0 to n-1) and m (0 to 9), and for each combination, compute the rotated digits, add m to each digit mod 10, and track the minimal such number.

Yes, that's a key insight. So the problem reduces to trying all possible k (number of shifts) from 0 to n-1, and all possible m (number of adds) from 0 to 9. For each combination, compute the resulting digits and select the minimal one.

So for each k in 0..n-1:

- rotate the original digits to the right by k positions. For example, original digits 579, k=1: rotated becomes 957. Wait, no. Wait, the shift moves each digit to the right by one, with the last digit moving to the first position. So, for example, 'abcd' shifted once becomes 'dabc'. So for k shifts, the rotation is equivalent to moving each digit to the right by k positions, with wrap-around. So for k shifts, the rotated array would be the original array rotated right by k steps. For example, for k=1, the array becomes [last element] + [all elements except last]. So for '579', rotated once is '957'.

Then, for each such rotated array, adding m to each digit mod 10 gives a new array. We need to find the combination of k and m that produces the lexicographically smallest array.

So the approach is:

1. Iterate over all possible k (0 to n-1) and m (0 to 9).

2. For each (k, m), compute the candidate array:

   a. Rotate the original array right by k positions.

   b. Add m to each digit mod 10.

3. Among all these candidates, select the lex smallest one.

This approach would have O(n * 10) possibilities. For each possibility, generating the candidate array is O(n) operations. So the total time is O(n^2 * 10). Since n can be up to 1000, this would be 1000*1000*10 = 10^7 operations, which is acceptable for the time constraints (Python can handle that in 2 seconds, but perhaps we need to optimize).

But how can we optimize this?

Wait, the problem requires that the output is the lex smallest array. So, for each possible (k, m), we can generate the candidate array as a string, and compare it with the current minimum.

So the steps would be:

- Initialize the minimal string as a very large value (like all '9's).

- For each possible rotation k (from 0 to n-1):

   - Rotate the original digits to the right by k positions. So the rotated digits are original[-k:] + original[:-k] (if k is 0, it's the original).

   - For each possible m (from 0 to 9):

      - Compute each digit in the rotated array plus m mod 10.

      - Convert this array into a string.

      - Compare with the current minimal string. If it's smaller, update the minimal.

But n is 1000, so for each k and m, generating the rotated array and then adding m to each digit would take O(n) time. For 1000*10=10,000 iterations, each with O(n) steps, the total is 10^4 * 1e3 = 1e7 operations, which is manageable in Python.

Yes. So the plan is feasible.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

First, read the input: n and the initial digits as a list of integers.

Then, precompute all possible rotated arrays. For each k, rotated array is s[-k:] + s[:-k], but since the original string is a string, perhaps it's easier to handle it as a string. For example, if the original string is '579', then rotated by k=1 would be '9' + '57' → '957'.

Wait, for each rotation k (right shifts by k steps), the rotated string is s[-k:] + s[:-k], where s is the original string.

So for example, s = 'abcd', k=1 → s[-1:] is 'd' and s[:-1] is 'abc', so rotated is 'dabc'. Which is correct.

So for each k from 0 to n-1, we can compute the rotated string as s_rot = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k != 0 else s.

Then, for each m (0-9), compute the transformed string by adding m to each character digit, mod 10.

But how to do this efficiently?

For each rotated string, and for each m, we can generate the transformed string by iterating through each character, converting it to int, adding m, mod 10, then back to string. Then compare with the current minimal.

So the steps in code:

Read n and s (the initial string).

Initialize min_str to '9' * n.

For k in 0 to n-1:

   rotated = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k !=0 else s

   for m in 0-9:

      transformed = ''.join( str( (int(c) + m) %10 ) for c in rotated )

      if transformed < min_str:

          min_str = transformed

Return min_str.

But wait, when n is 1000, and k is 500, then s[-500:] is the last 500 characters, and s[:-500] is the first 500. So the rotated string can be computed efficiently.

In Python, string slicing is O(k), but since we are creating a new string each time, for each k, the rotated string is created in O(n) time. Then for each m, the transformed string is created in O(n) time. So for each (k, m) pair, O(n) time. So total O(10 * n^2) operations.

But when n=1000, 10*1e6 = 1e7 operations, which should be manageable. However, in Python, even 1e8 operations can be a problem, but 1e7 is okay.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize. For example, precompute all possible rotated strings for all k. Then, for each rotated string, compute all 10 possible m additions and check which is the minimal. Then compare all those.

But the code as outlined seems manageable.

Testing the examples:

First example:

Input: 3, 579.

Possible k=0: rotated is 579.

For m=0: 579 → 579.

For m=1: 680 → 680.

But wait, the sample output is 024. Let's see. The sample output comes from shifting twice (k=2) and adding 5.

Original digits: 579. Rotating right by 2 steps gives s[-2:] is '79' + s[:-2] is '5' → '795' → no, wait. Wait, s is '579'. For k=2, s[-2:] is '79', s[:-2] is '5', so rotated is '795'? Then adding m=5: 7+5=12 mod10=2; 9+5=14 mod10=4; 5+5=10 mod10=0. So transformed is 240. Wait, but sample output is 024. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, the sample input is 3 digits: 579. The correct answer is 024. Let's see how that's achieved.

Looking at possible shifts and adds:

For example, shifting once (k=1) → '957'. Then adding 5: (9+5)%10=4, (5+5)%10=0, (7+5)%10=2 → gives 402. Not the minimal.

Another possibility: shifting twice (k=2) → '795'. Adding 5 → 240. Still not 024.

Alternatively, shifting three times (but n=3, so k=0 is same as 3 shifts). Wait, no. Because k is modulo n. So for n=3, shifting 4 times is equivalent to shifting once.

Wait, perhaps I need to check for k=0,1,2.

Wait, when k=3, it's equivalent to k=0. So for the first sample, the minimal is achieved when k=2 (rotated '579' after shifting 2 times → '795'?), but wait, no. Wait, for k=2, the rotated string would be s[-2:] + s[:-2]. s is '579', s[-2:] is '79', s[:-2] is '5', so rotated is '795'. Adding m=5 gives 2 (7+5=12 mod10=2), 4 (9+5=14 mod10=4), 0 (5+5=10 mod10=0). So the transformed is 240. Which is not the sample output.

Hmm, then perhaps the sample output comes from another combination.

Wait, the sample output is 024. Let's see. For that, the digits are 0,2,4. Let's see which rotation and add would produce this.

Looking for a rotated string which, when added m, gives 0,2,4. So each digit in the rotated array plus m mod 10 equals the target digit.

So for example:

Suppose the target digits are 0,2,4. Then m can be (0 - rotated_digit) mod10. So for each digit in rotated, (rotated_digit + m) mod10 = target_digit. So m is (target_digit - rotated_digit) mod10. But all digits must have the same m.

So for the target 024, m must be such that:

m ≡ (0 - rotated[0]) mod10,

m ≡ (2 - rotated[1]) mod10,

m ≡ (4 - rotated[2]) mod10.

So for m to be the same for all three digits, these three equations must hold. So the rotated array's digits must satisfy (0 - rotated[0]) ≡ (2 - rotated[1]) ≡ (4 - rotated[2}) mod10.

So let's find such a rotated array.

Suppose the rotated array is 5,7,9 (original array). Then for m=5, 5+5=10 mod10=0, 7+5=12 mod10=2, 9+5=14 mod10=4 → which gives 024. So the rotated array is 579, and m=5. But how?

Wait, the original array is 579. So if we rotate by k=0 (no shift), then adding m=5 gives each digit as 0,2,4 → 024. Which matches the sample output. Oh right! So the sample input's output is achieved by k=0 and m=5.

So in that case, the code would generate for k=0 and m=5 the transformed digits 024, which is the minimal possible.

So why in the first example, the code would choose k=0 and m=5. So the code works.

Another example: input 4, 2014. Output is 0142.

Looking for k and m such that after rotation and adding m, the digits are 0142.

For example, suppose rotated array is 4201. Adding m=8:

4+8=12 mod10=2, 2+8=10 mod10=0, 0+8=8, 1+8=9 → no.

Alternatively, the rotated array may be 1420. Adding m=9: (1+9)=0,4+9=13→3, 2+9=11→1, 0+9=9 → 0319. Not the desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotated array is 2014. Add m=8: 2014 +8 → (2+8=0, 0+8=8, 1+8=9,4+8=12→2) → 0892. Not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct combination is k=3 and m=0.

Rotating 2014 by k=3: the rotated array is the last 3 digits (014) plus the first digit (2) → 0142. Then adding m=0 gives 0142. So that's the minimal. So for k=3 and m=0, the rotated array is '4201'?

Wait, maybe I need to re-calculate.

Original array is 2014. Let's see:

k=3 rotations. Each rotation shifts right once. Let's compute rotated after k=3 shifts.

Original: 2 0 1 4.

Shift once: 4 2 0 1.

Shift again: 1 4 2 0.

Shift third time: 0 1 4 2.

Wait, no. Wait, each shift moves the last character to the front.

So for k=1, rotated is '4201' → original is 2 0 1 4 → shift once → last element (4) moves to front → 4 2 0 1.

k=2 shifts: after first shift: 4 2 0 1; second shift: 1 4 2 0.

k=3 shifts: third shift: 0 1 4 2.

Wait, no. Let me think for k=3 shifts:

Original array: 2014 → indices 0,1,2,3.

Shift 1: move index 3 to front → [4, 2,0,1].

Shift 2: move index 3 (1) to front → [1,4,2,0].

Shift 3: move index 3 (0) to front → [0,1,4,2].

Yes. So after k=3 shifts, rotated array is '0142'. So adding m=0 gives 0142, which is the sample output.

So for k=3 and m=0, the transformed array is 0142, which is the minimal.

So the code would generate this.

Thus, the approach seems to work.

Now, code-wise, how to handle the rotations.

In Python, the input string is read as s. For each k in 0 to n-1, the rotated string is s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k !=0 else s.

So for example, for s = '2014', k=3: s[-3:] is '014', s[:-3] is '2' → rotated is '014' + '2' → '0142'? Wait, no. Wait, the original s is '2014' (length 4). For k=3, s[-3:] is the last 3 characters: '014', s[:-3] is the first 4-3=1 character: '2'. So rotated is '014' + '2' → '0142', which is correct.

Yes. So the code for generating rotated is correct.

So the code would generate all possible rotated strings for k in 0 to n-1, then for each of those, apply all possible m in 0-9, compute the transformed string, and track the minimal.

Now, the code needs to handle the rotated strings correctly and efficiently.

Now, possible optimizations:

1. Precompute all rotated strings once for all k. Then, for each rotated string, compute the 10 possible m additions.

But even if not precomputed, the code will handle it.

Another optimization is to compute the transformed string for each m by iterating once through the rotated string's characters, converting to integer, adding m, mod 10, then appending to a list. Then converting the list to a string.

But since the code is in Python, string concatenation can be optimized with list comprehensions.

So, in code:

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)  # wait, wait. Wait, the first line of input is n, then the second line is the digits. So the code should read n, then the digits. So code is:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

Then, the code proceeds.

So the code would be:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

min_str = '9' * n

for k in range(n):
    # compute rotated string
    rotated = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k !=0 else s
    for m in range(10):
        # compute transformed string
        transformed = []
        for c in rotated:
            new_digit = (int(c) + m) % 10
            transformed.append(str(new_digit))
        transformed = ''.join(transformed)
        if transformed < min_str:
            min_str = transformed

print(min_str)

Wait, but for k=0, s[-0:] is the entire string (since in Python, s[-0:] is the same as s[0:], which is the entire string). So s[-0:] + s[:-0] is s + s[:0] (since s[:-0] is s[:n-0], but when k=0, s[:-0] is empty). So for k=0, rotated is s + '' → s. So the code is correct.

Testing this code with the first sample input:

Sample 1:

n=3, s='579'

k=0: rotated is '579'.

m=5: 5+5=10 →0, 7+5=12 →2,9+5=14 →4 → transformed is '024', which is the sample output. So when this transformed is generated, it will be compared to the initial min_str (999), and set as new min. Then, no other combination will generate a smaller string. So the code works.

Sample 2:

n=4, s='2014'

k=3: rotated is '0142'. m=0: transformed is '0142', which is the sample output. So when this combination is considered, it will be the new min_str.

Thus, the code works.

But in Python, for large n (like 1000), how efficient is this code? Let's see.

Each iteration of k loops n times (1000 times), and for each, m loops 10 times. For each (k, m), the rotated is created once. Then, for each rotated, it creates a transformed string by looping through each character (1000 steps). So total steps: 1000 * 10 * 1000 = 10,000,000 operations. Each operation is simple: convert character to int, add m, mod 10, convert back to string. In Python, this should be manageable within 2 seconds. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

But perhaps the code can be optimized by precomputing the rotated strings once for each k and storing them, and then processing the m values. But in the current code, the rotated string is recomputed for each m. But for a given k, m varies from 0 to 9. So for each k, rotated is the same for all m. So the code can precompute rotated for each k first, and then process all m for that rotated. Which is what the code currently does. So that's optimal.

Another optimization is to precompute all possible rotated strings and store them as lists of integers, so that when adding m, it's just adding to each element in the list. For example, for each rotated string, convert it to a list of integers. Then, for each m, compute (d + m) %10 for each digit d, then convert to a string.

This may speed up the processing for m.

For example:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

min_str = '9' * n

for k in range(n):
    rotated_str = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k !=0 else s
    rotated_digits = [int(c) for c in rotated_str]
    for m in range(10):
        transformed = ''.join( str( (d + m) %10 ) for d in rotated_digits )
        if transformed < min_str:
            min_str = transformed

But converting rotated_str to a list of integers once per k, and then using that for all m. So for each k, we process the rotated digits once. This could save some time, as for each m, instead of converting each character to int each time (for each m), we can use the precomputed list of integers.

Yes, this would be more efficient. Because for each k, the rotated_str is converted to a list of integers once, then for each m, we just loop through the list and compute (d + m) mod10.

In the original code, for each (k, m) pair, the code converts each character to int again. For example, when k=0 and m varies from 0 to 9, the code converts each character in rotated_str (which is the same for all m) 10 times. But with the precomputed list of integers, it's converted once, then used for all m.

This should reduce the number of operations. For n=1000, this would save 9 * 1000 conversions per k, which is significant.

So the optimized code would be:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

min_str = '9' * n

for k in range(n):
    rotated_str = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k !=0 else s
    digits = [int(c) for c in rotated_str]
    for m in range(10):
        transformed = []
        for d in digits:
            transformed.append( str( (d + m) %10 ) )
        transformed = ''.join(transformed)
        if transformed < min_str:
            min_str = transformed

print(min_str)

This should be faster.

Another possible optimization is to precompute all possible (d + m) %10 for each digit d in the rotated string. But since for each m, this is O(n) per transformed string, perhaps the code can't be optimized further.

But in Python, using list comprehensions or generators can be more efficient. For example, instead of appending to a list in a loop, we can create the transformed string using a list comprehension:

transformed = ''.join( [ str( (d + m) %10 ) for d in digits ] )

But even better, perhaps precompute the digits as a list of integers once per k, and then for each m, create the transformed string by adding m to each digit and mod 10.

Another way is to precompute for each digit in the rotated string, the possible (d + m) for m in 0-9. But that would take O(n*10) space for each rotated string, which is not feasible for n=1e3 (1e4 per rotated string, and 1e3 rotated strings → 1e7 entries). But perhaps it's manageable.

But this is probably overkill. The current code with precomputing the digits list per k is sufficient.

So the code should be efficient enough.

Now, test case 1:

Sample 1:

Input:
3
579

Code:

n=3, s='579'.

k=0:

rotated_str = '579'.

digits = [5,7,9].

For m=5:

transformed = (5+5=10%10=0, 7+5=12%10=2, 9+5=14%10=4) → '024'. Which is the minimal.

So code would set min_str to '024'.

Other combinations may generate larger strings, so the code works.

Sample 2:

Input:
4
2014

Code:

For k=3, rotated_str is '4201' → no, wait, wait. Let's re-calculate.

Original s is '2014'.

k=3: s[-3:] is '014', s[:-3] is '2'. So rotated_str is '014' + '2' → '0142'? No, because for k=3, s[-3:] is the last 3 characters: s is 4 characters. s[-3:] for k=3 is s[1:4] → '014'? Wait, no. Wait, in Python, s[-k:] for k=3 when len(s) is 4:

s = '2014' → indexes 0,1,2,3.

s[-3:] → starts at index 1 (because -3 is index 1 in a 4-length string: 4-3=1). So s[1:4] → '014'.

s[:-3] → from start to index -3 (exclusive). len(s) is 4. So s[:-3] is s[:1], which is '2'.

So rotated_str is '014' + '2' → '0142'.

digits are [0,1,4,2].

For m=0: transformed is '0142', which is the sample output.

Thus, code will find this combination and set min_str to '0142'.

So the code works.

Thus, the code is correct.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest possible number that can be obtained by pressing two buttons on a combination lock. The first button increments all digits by 1 (mod 10), and the second button shifts all digits to the right. The goal is to find the optimal sequence of these operations to achieve the smallest lexicographical number.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Operations**: The two operations allowed are incrementing all digits by 1 (mod 10) and shifting all digits to the right. The order of these operations can be reorganized such that all shifts are performed first, followed by all increments. This insight allows us to consider each possible shift and increment combination efficiently.
2. **Rotation and Increment**: For each possible right shift (from 0 to n-1), we generate the rotated string. For each rotation, we then consider all possible increments (from 0 to 9) and compute the resulting string after applying the increment.
3. **Lexicographical Comparison**: For each combination of rotation and increment, we generate the resulting string and keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered.

### Solution Code
```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()
min_str = '9' * n

for k in range(n):
    rotated = s[-k:] + s[:-k] if k != 0 else s
    digits = [int(c) for c in rotated]
    for m in range(10):
        transformed = ''.join(str((d + m) % 10) for d in digits)
        if transformed < min_str:
            min_str = transformed

print(min_str)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (number of digits) and a string `s` representing the initial state of the lock.
2. **Initialization**: We initialize `min_str` to the maximum possible value (all '9's) to ensure any valid combination will be smaller.
3. **Rotation Loop**: For each possible rotation `k`, we compute the rotated string. This is done by slicing the original string into two parts and concatenating them in reverse order.
4. **Increment Loop**: For each increment value `m` (from 0 to 9), we compute the new digits by applying the increment modulo 10 to each digit in the rotated string.
5. **Comparison**: Each transformed string is compared with the current minimum string, updating `min_str` if a smaller string is found.
6. **Output**: Finally, the smallest string found is printed.

This approach efficiently explores all possible combinations of rotations and increments, ensuring the solution is optimal both in time and space complexity. The algorithm runs in O(n^2 * 10) time, which is feasible given the problem constraints.
