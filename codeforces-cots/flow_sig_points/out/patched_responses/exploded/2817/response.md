Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given a base64 encoded string s, I have to find the number of pairs of words (a, b) such that their bitwise AND equals s. The result should be modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.

First, let's understand the problem. Each character in the input represents a base64 digit (0-63). For each character in s, we need to find all possible pairs of digits (x, y) such that x & y equals the digit corresponding to that character. Then multiply the possibilities for each character in the string to get the total number of pairs.

Right. So the key here is for each character in s, determine how many possible (x, y) pairs there are where x & y is equal to the value of that character. Then multiply all these counts together, modulo 1e9+7.

So the plan is: process each character in s, compute the number of valid pairs for that character's value, multiply all these numbers together.

But how do I compute the number of pairs for a single digit?

Let's think for a single digit. Let's say the target is t. So x & y = t. How many (x, y) pairs satisfy this?

Each of x and y is a 6-bit number since 64 is 2^6. So each can be represented as 6 bits. The AND of x and y must equal t's 6-bit representation.

So for each bit position in t, we can determine what possible bits x and y can have in that position.

Let's break it down per bit. For each bit in t's binary representation, say bit i (0 to 5, from least to most significant?), the possible x_i and y_i bits must satisfy x_i & y_i = t_i.

So for each bit in t:

Case 1: t's bit is 1. Then x_i and y_i must both be 1. Because 1 & 1 = 1, any other combination would give 0.

Case 2: t's bit is 0. Then x_i and y_i can be any combination where at least one is 0. So possible pairs are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). So three possibilities for this bit.

So for each bit in the target digit, if the bit is 1, the bits of x and y are fixed as 1. If the bit is 0, there are 3 possibilities.

Therefore, the total number of pairs for the digit t is 3^k, where k is the number of zero bits in t's binary representation.

Wait, yes. Because each zero bit contributes 3 possibilities. Each 1 bit contributes 1 (only one possibility). So the product is 3^number_of_zero_bits.

So the approach is:

For each character in s:

1. Convert the character to its 6-bit value (t).
2. Count the number of zero bits in t's binary representation (k).
3. Multiply the total result by 3^k (mod 1e9+7).

So the main steps are:

- Precompute for each possible character in the input, the number of zero bits in their base64 value, then compute 3^count and multiply all these.

Wait, but how do I compute the base64 value for each character?

Let's see the encoding:

Digits 0-9: 0-9.

A-Z: 10-35.

a-z: 36-61.

-: 62

_: 63.

So for a given character, need to compute its value. Let's create a helper function or a dictionary to map each character to its corresponding value.

But for speed, since the input can be up to 1e5 characters, it's better to precompute a dictionary once.

So first, create a dictionary that maps each allowed character (digits, uppercase, lowercase, '-', '_') to its 6-bit value.

Once we have the value for each character, for each character in the input string, compute the number of zero bits in its 6-bit representation. Then multiply 3^zeros for each such character.

The total is the product of all 3^zeros for each character, modulo 1e9+7.

So the steps in code:

1. Precompute the mapping from characters to their base64 values.

2. For each character in the input string:

   a. Find its value t.

   b. Compute the number of zero bits in t's 6-bit representation.

3. For each zero bit count, compute 3^zeros and multiply all together, mod 1e9+7.

But how to compute the number of zero bits in t's binary representation, considering that t is 6 bits?

For example, if t is 63 (binary 111111), then all bits are 1. So zero bits count is 0, so the multiplier is 1. So for each character in s that's '_' (value 63), the contribution is 3^0 = 1.

Wait, but let's take the first example: input is 'z'. 'z' is in a-z, which is 36 + (ord('z') - ord('a')). Let's see:

The value of 'z' is 36 + 25 = 61. Binary of 61 is 111101. The bits are 5 ones and one zero. So number of zero bits is 1. So 3^1 =3. Which matches the sample output of 3.

Yes. So for each character, the number of zero bits in the 6-bit value is key.

So the code steps:

First, build the value mapping.

Then, for each character in s:

- get the value t.

- count the number of zero bits in t's 6-bit binary. For example, 63 is 0b111111: zero bits is 0.

Then, compute the product of (3^zeros_count) for all characters, mod 1e9+7.

So the main challenge is:

1. Efficiently converting each character to its base64 value.

2. Efficiently counting the number of zero bits in each 6-bit number.

How to count the zero bits:

For a 6-bit number, we can check each of the 6 bits. For example, t can be 0 to 63.

So for t in 0-63:

count = 0

for i in 0 to 5:

if (t & (1 << (5 - i))) == 0:

count +=1

Wait, but perhaps a faster way is to compute the number of zero bits in t's 6-bit representation.

Alternatively, for each t, the number of zero bits is equal to 6 minus the number of set bits (1s) in t's binary. Because each bit is either 1 or 0.

Wait, no. Because if the number is 63 (111111), then all bits are 1, so zero bits is 0, which is 6 -6=0. If the number is 61 (111101), the zero bits is 1. The number of 1s is 5, 6-5=1. So yes, the number of zero bits is (6 - number of set bits) in the 6-bit value.

But wait, what about numbers that have leading zeros beyond 6 bits? No, since each character is a 6-bit value (0-63), so when represented as 6 bits, leading zeros are part of the bits.

So for example, the value 0 is 000000 in 6 bits. So the zero bits count is 6, which would contribute 3^6 to the product.

So the plan is: for each t (0-63), compute the number of 1 bits in its binary representation (including leading zeros up to 6 bits). Then zeros = 6 - ones_count.

So for each character in the input:

- get its value t.

- compute ones = bin(t | 0b1000000).count('1') - 1. Wait, no. Wait, for a 6-bit number, t can be from 0 to 63. So the binary is up to 6 bits. So when we convert t to binary, it may have leading zeros. For example, t=3 is 0b0011, but as a 6-bit number it's 000011. So to count the number of 1 bits, we can use bin(t).count('1')? No, because for t=3, bin(t) is '11' which counts two 1s, but in 6-bit it's 000011, which also has two 1s. So zeros would be 6 - 2 =4. So the zeros count is 4, which is correct.

Wait, but the actual binary digits in 6 bits may have leading zeros, which are counted in the zeros. So the number of 1 bits is the same as the count of 1s in the binary representation of t (regardless of leading zeros). Because leading zeros are part of the 6 bits.

Wait no. For example, t=8 is 1000 in binary, which is 4 bits. But as a 6-bit number, it's 001000. So the leading two zeros are part of the 6 bits. So the total 1 bits is 1, zeros are 5. So zeros count is 5.

But if we compute bin(t) as '0b1000', which is four bits. The count of '1's is 1, which is correct. Then zeros is 6 -1=5.

So yes, the number of 1 bits in the 6-bit representation is exactly the number of 1 bits in the value t. Because leading zeros (due to the 6-bit requirement) are considered as zeros, but they are part of the 6 bits. But the value of t is such that leading zeros are not part of its binary representation (since leading zeros don't affect the value). However, when considering the 6-bit representation, leading zeros are included. So the zeros count is 6 minus the number of 1 bits in the value.

Wait, for example:

t=3: binary is 11. 6-bit is 000011. So number of 1 bits is 2. zeros count is 4.

t=63: binary is 111111. 6 bits. 1 bits count is 6. zeros count 0.

t=0: binary is 0. 6 bits: 000000. 1 bits count 0. zeros count 6.

So the zeros count is 6 - bin(t).count('1').

Yes. Because in the 6-bit representation, the number of 1 bits is exactly bin(t).count('1'), and the zeros count is 6 minus that.

So for any t in 0-63, zeros = 6 - bin(t).count('1').

So the formula is zeros = 6 - count_of_ones.

Therefore, for each character, compute its t, then zeros = 6 - bin(t).count('1'), then multiply 3^zeros for all characters.

So the problem reduces to:

- For each character in the input, compute t, then zeros = 6 - bin(t).count('1'), then multiply 3^zeros for all characters.

Now, the code.

First, create a mapping from characters to their t values.

How to create that?

We can create a dictionary. Let's think.

The mapping is:

Digits '0' - '9' → 0-9.

Letters 'A'-'Z' → 10-35.

Letters 'a'-'z' → 36-61.

'-' →62.

'_' →63.

So to build this:

We can loop through each possible character and assign their t values.

For example:

for c in '0' to '9': t = int(c)

for c in 'A'-'Z': t = 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A'))

for c in 'a'-'z': t = 36 + (ord(c) - ord('a'))

for '-', t=62.

for '_', t=63.

So code-wise, we can precompute a dictionary.

In Python, perhaps using a helper function to compute the value.

But for speed, since the input can be up to 1e5 characters, we need to make this as efficient as possible.

So code:

Create a dictionary that maps each possible character to its value.

Let's write code to build this:

char_to_value = {}

for c in '0123456789':
    char_to_value[c] = int(c)

for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
    char_to_value[c] = 10 + ord(c) - ord('A')

for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
    char_to_value[c] = 36 + ord(c) - ord('a')

char_to_value['-'] = 62
char_to_value['_'] = 63

Alternatively, using a helper function.

But this approach is straightforward and efficient.

Once we have this mapping, for each character in the input string s, we can get its t.

Now, for each t, compute the number of zeros (6 - bin(t).count('1')).

But wait, bin(t) returns a string starting with '0b', so bin(3) is '0b11', so bin(t).count('1') is 2.

So for example, t=3 → bin(t) → '0b11' → count is 2 → zeros=6-2=4.

Which is correct.

But for t=0, bin(0) is '0b0' → count is 0 → zeros=6.

Which is correct.

So yes, this works.

So for each character in s:

t = char_to_value[c]

zeros = 6 - bin(t).count('1')

Then, the multiplier for this character is 3^zeros.

The total result is the product of all these multipliers, modulo 1e9+7.

But since the input can be up to 1e5 characters, and for each we need to compute 3^k, where k is up to 6, then the total product is (3^0) * (3^1) * ... etc., but for each character, it's 3^ (zeros for that character). So the exponents add up. Because 3^a *3^b =3^(a+b).

But for 1e5 characters, the sum of zeros can be up to 6*1e5=6e5. So 3^6e5 is a huge number. But since we have to compute modulo 1e9+7, we need to compute the product modulo 1e9+7.

But how to compute this efficiently?

For each character, compute the exponent, then multiply the result by (3^exponent) mod MOD. But computing 3^exponent each time is O(1) if we precompute the powers of 3 up to 6.

Wait, the exponent for each character is 0 to 6. So the possible exponents are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. So for each character, the possible multiplier is 3^0, 3^1, ..., 3^6. So instead of computing 3^k each time, we can precompute a list of 3^0 to 3^6, which is [1,3,9,27,81,243,729]. Then, for each character, look up the corresponding multiplier.

Yes! Because for a character with k zero bits, the multiplier is 3^k. Since k can be 0 to 6, we can precompute the possible values.

So precompute a list:

pow3 = [1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729]

Then, for each character, zeros can be 0-6, so the multiplier is pow3[zeros].

So for example, if a character has 3 zero bits, multiply the result by 27.

This is much faster than computing 3^zeros each time.

So the code steps:

1. Precompute the pow3 array for exponents 0-6.

pow3 = [1]

current = 1

for i in 1 to 6:

current *=3

pow3.append(current)

So pow3 is [1,3,9,27,81,243,729].

2. For each character in s:

   a. get t from char_to_value.

   b. count zeros = 6 - bin(t).count('1').

   c. get multiplier as pow3[zeros].

   d. multiply the total result by multiplier, modulo 1e9+7.

This approach is O(n) time, where n is the length of s. For 1e5 characters, this is acceptable.

Now, handling the mod:

We need to compute the product modulo 1e9+7. So initial result is 1. For each character, multiply the current result by the multiplier (from pow3) and mod by 1e9+7.

So in code:

MOD = 10**9 +7

result = 1

for c in s:

    t = char_to_value[c]

    ones = bin(t).count('1')

    zeros = 6 - ones

    result = (result * pow3[zeros]) % MOD

Return result.

So the code is efficient.

Now, the main code steps:

- Precompute char_to_value.

- Precompute pow3 array.

- Read s.

- Compute the result.

Now, handling the character to value mapping.

In Python, for each character in s, check which category it's in. But using a dictionary is O(1) per lookup.

So building the dictionary as described.

But how to handle all possible characters allowed in the input?

The problem says: the input s consists of digits, lowercase, uppercase, '-', '_'.

So the code for building the dictionary is correct.

Now, testing the first sample:

Sample 1:

Input 'z'.

z is in a-z. Its value is 36 + 25 = 61.

61 in binary is 0b111101. So bin(61) is '0b111101', which has five 1s. So zeros is 6 -5 =1. So multiplier is 3^1=3. So the result is 3. Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input 'V_V'.

Breaking down each character:

V is uppercase.

First 'V' → 10 + 21 =31.

Second '_' →63.

Third 'V' →31.

So for each character:

First V: 31 in binary is 0b11111 (5 bits) → but as a 6-bit number, it's 011111. So count of ones is 5. zeros =6-5=1. multiplier 3.

Second '_' →63 is 0b111111. count 6. zeros 0. multiplier 1.

Third V: same as first → multiplier 3.

Total product: 3 *1 *3 =9. Which matches the sample.

Sample 3:

The input is 'Codeforces', but the output is 130653412. We can trust the code to compute that correctly.

Now, code steps:

Implement the dictionary, precompute pow3, read s, compute the product.

Potential edge cases:

- All characters are '_' (63) → each contributes 3^0=1. So the product is 1.

- All characters are 0 (t=0). Then each contributes 3^6. So for s of length n, the product is 3^(6n).

But for n=1e5, that's 3^6e5. But mod 1e9+7, we can compute it with pow(3, 6*1e5, MOD). But in code, since each step multiplies by 3^6 and mod, it's handled.

Now, code in Python.

But since the input can be up to 1e5 characters, we need to process it efficiently.

Implementing the code:

First, build the char_to_value dictionary.

Then precompute pow3 array.

Read the input string.

Initialize result as 1.

For each character in s:

   get t from char_to_value.

   ones = bin(t).count('1')

   zeros =6 - ones.

   multiply result by pow3[zeros], mod MOD.

Print result.

Now, code:

But how to handle the char_to_value efficiently.

In Python, the code can be written as:

Sample3: 'Codeforces' → let's see.

But the code will process each character and compute the product. The sample output is correct.

So this code should work.

Now, check for possible optimizations.

In Python, using a dictionary may be slightly slower for 1e5 lookups, but it's manageable. Alternatively, using a precomputed array with ord(c) as the key, but that's possible.

But for the given problem, the code is acceptable.

Another possible optimization: precompute for each character its multiplier (pow3[zeros]) once. But since the code is already O(n), and n is up to 1e5, it's okay.

But in Python, the code may be optimized by precomputing a mapping from characters to their multipliers. However, building such a mapping would take time, but for 1e5 characters, it's negligible.

Alternatively, for each character in the input, compute t, then zeros, then multiply. As the code does.

The code is correct and efficient.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pairs of words of a given length such that their bitwise AND results in the given string. The solution involves converting each character in the string to its base64 value, calculating the number of valid pairs for each character, and then combining these results using modular arithmetic.

### Approach
1. **Character to Base64 Value Mapping**: Convert each character in the input string to its corresponding base64 value using predefined rules.
2. **Bitwise Analysis**: For each base64 value, determine the number of valid pairs of digits (x, y) such that their bitwise AND equals the base64 value. This is done by counting the number of zero bits in the binary representation of the value, as each zero bit allows three valid combinations (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Compute the product of the number of valid pairs for each character, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Code
```python
char_to_value = {}
for c in '0123456789':
    char_to_value[c] = int(c)
for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
    char_to_value[c] = 10 + ord(c) - ord('A')
for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
    char_to_value[c] = 36 + ord(c) - ord('a')
char_to_value['-'] = 62
char_to_value['_'] = 63

pow3 = [1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729]

MOD = 10**9 + 7

s = input().strip()
result = 1
for c in s:
    t = char_to_value[c]
    ones = bin(t).count('1')
    zeros = 6 - ones
    result = (result * pow3[zeros]) % MOD

print(result)
```

### Explanation
1. **Character Mapping**: Each character is mapped to its base64 value using a dictionary. This allows quick lookup of values during processing.
2. **Zero Bit Calculation**: For each character's base64 value, the number of zero bits in its 6-bit binary representation is calculated. This determines the number of valid pairs for that character.
3. **Efficient Calculation**: The number of valid pairs for each character is precomputed as powers of 3 (since each zero bit contributes 3 possibilities). The product of these values, modulo \(10^9 + 7\), gives the final result.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints, processing each character in constant time and maintaining a linear time complexity overall.
