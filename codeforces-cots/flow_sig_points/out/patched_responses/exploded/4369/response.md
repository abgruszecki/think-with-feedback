Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully and understand what's required.

The problem is about restoring an array with certain conditions. The array elements can be either given (1 to 200) or -1, which means they need to be filled in. The restored array must satisfy specific constraints based on the neighbors of each element. The goal is to find the number of valid ways to restore the array, modulo 998244353.

The constraints are:
- For the first element (i=1), a₁ ≤ a₂.
- For the last element (i=n), aₙ ≤ aₙ₋₁.
- For all other elements (i from 2 to n-1), a_i ≤ max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

Hmm. So each element must not be larger than at least one of its adjacent elements, except for the first and last which have specific constraints. Wait, no. Wait, the first element must be <= the second, which is a stricter condition. Similarly for the last element.

So the approach is dynamic programming. Because each choice for the current element depends on the previous choices. But how?

Let me think about the DP state. For each position i, and for each possible value v that a_i can take, we need to track some information that allows us to compute the number of valid sequences up to i. The key is to track what's necessary for the next steps.

For example, when processing the i-th element, what do we need to know from the (i-1)-th element? Since the condition for i-1 might depend on i-2 and i. Wait, but for the i-th element, when considering the next element (i+1), the condition for the i-th element would require that a_i ≤ max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

This seems tricky. How can we model this in DP?

Alternative approach: model the state based on the possible values of a_i and the maximum of the previous element or something else. Let's think step by step.

Let's consider the array from left to right. For each position i, the state could be the value of a_i and the value of a_{i-1}, but that might be too much. For n up to 1e5, we need O(n) time with states that have a manageable number of possibilities (like 200 options).

Wait, perhaps we can model the DP state as the value of the previous element (a_{i}) and the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_{i} (or something similar). Wait, but for position i+1, the condition is that a_{i+1} <= max(a_i, a_{i+2}).

Hmm, this seems a bit challenging. Let's think about the problem again. The conditions must hold for the restored array. So for each element (except the first and last), the element must be <= the maximum of its neighbors. For the first element, it's <= the second, and for the last, <= the previous.

Wait, but the first element's condition is a₁ <= a₂, which is equivalent to a₁ <= max(a₂, a_0) if there were an a_0, but since there's not, the first element's condition is a₁ <= a₂. Similarly, the last is a_n <= a_{n-1}.

So the problem is to fill in the -1s such that all these conditions are satisfied.

The DP approach for such problems usually involves tracking the possible values of the current element and some related information that affects the next step.

Let me think for the first example:

Sample Input 1:
3
1 -1 2

The possible a₂ is 2. Because a₁=1 must be <= a₂, and a₃=2 must be >= a₂. So a₂ must be >=1 and <=2. But also, the middle element (a₂) must satisfy a₂ <= max(a₁, a₃). Since a₁ is 1 and a₃ is 2, the max is 2. So a₂ can be up to 2. But since a₁ must be <= a₂ and a₃ must be >= a₂, the possible values of a₂ are 1 or 2. Wait, but in the sample output, it's 1. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait in the first sample, the array is [1, x, 2]. The conditions are:

For i=1: 1 <= x (since a₁ <= a₂). For i=3: 2 <= x (since a₃ <= a₂). Wait, no: the last element's condition is a₃ <= a₂ (because aₙ must be <= a_{n-1}). So in this case, the last element is 2. So 2 must be <= a₂. So x must be >= 2. But the first condition is 1 <= x. So x >=2. Also, the middle element (x) must be <= max(1, 2) which is 2. So x can be between 2 and 2. So only possible x is 2. Hence the output is 1.

Ah, right. So the constraints for the first and last elements are more restrictive.

So the problem requires that for the restored array, each element (except first and last) is <= the maximum of its immediate neighbors. For first element, it's <= the next, and last is <= previous.

So the DP needs to track, for each position, the possible values of a_i and perhaps some other variables that affect the constraints for the next positions.

Let me think of the transitions. Let's process the array from left to right.

For position i, the possible choices of a_i depend on the previous elements, and affect the next elements.

For example, for the first element (i=1), if it's fixed (not -1), then a_1 must be <= a_2. So when processing a_2, we need to know that a_1 is <= a_2. But how?

Alternatively, for the DP state, maybe we can track the maximum of the previous two elements. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the state as the value of a_i and the value of a_{i-1}, because for the next element, a_{i+1} must satisfy that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

Wait, the condition for a_i is that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But when processing a_i+1, the condition for a_i is already determined. Wait, no: the a_i+1's choice affects whether a_i satisfies the condition. So the problem is that the choice of a_{i+1} affects the validity of a_i.

This complicates things. Because the validity of a_i depends on a_{i+1}, which is to the right. So a DP approach that goes from left to right would not have the necessary information for a_i's condition, as the right neighbor hasn't been processed yet.

So this suggests that the problem can't be solved with a simple left-to-right DP, because the condition for a_i depends on a_{i+1}, which is not yet known.

But how can we model this?

Alternative idea: For each position i, the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_{i+1} must be >= a_i. So, for the DP, perhaps we need to track the possible values of a_i and a_{i+1} to ensure that the conditions are satisfied.

But that's tricky. Let's think of the array as a chain. For each element, the conditions involve the previous and next elements.

Another approach: Let's model the DP state for position i as the value of a_i and the maximum possible value that a_{i+1} can take to satisfy the condition for a_i. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP state as the possible value of a_i and the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_{i} (or something similar). Wait, let's think for each position i, when processing it, we can track the possible a_i and a_{i-1}, which allows us to check the condition for a_{i-1} (since a_{i-1} must be <= max(a_{i-2}, a_i}).

But this seems like a recursive problem. For example, when processing i, we need to know a_{i} and a_{i-1}, and ensure that the previous elements up to i-1 are valid. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two passes: left to right and right to left, combining constraints.

Wait, let's think about the constraints:

For the first and last elements, their constraints are straightforward (they must be <= their next or previous elements). For the middle elements, they must be <= the max of their left and right neighbors.

But since the max can be either left or right, the problem is that for a middle element, one of the neighbors (left or right) must be >= it. So for each middle element, at least one neighbor is >= it.

But when building the array, how can we enforce this?

Another observation: For any position i (2 <= i <=n-1), a_i can be any value as long as either a_{i-1} >= a_i or a_{i+1} >= a_i. But since the a_{i+1} is not known when processing left to right, this complicates the DP.

Hmm. So perhaps the DP needs to track the state for the current position, and some information about the next possible values. But that might not be feasible for large n.

Wait, but for each position i, the constraints can be broken down into two possibilities: a_i <= a_{i-1}, or a_i <= a_{i+1}.

But since a_i's validity depends on a_{i+1}, which is in the future, this seems difficult. However, maybe we can find a way to model the DP such that for each position, the state captures what's necessary for the next steps.

Alternatively, perhaps for the problem, the constraints can be modeled in a way that allows us to process the array in a left-to-right manner, tracking some information that allows us to compute the necessary conditions.

Let me think again. Let's consider the array from left to right.

At position i, for the first element (i=1), the next element (i=2) must be >= a_1. For the middle elements (i from 2 to n-1), a_i must be <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But when processing i, we don't know a_{i+1}. So how can we model the DP in such a way that the conditions are satisfied when we get to a_{i+1}?

Alternatively, perhaps the DP can track, for each possible value of a_i, the necessary conditions that the next element must satisfy.

For example, when processing i, the DP state is the possible value of a_i and the maximum allowed value for a_{i+1} based on the previous elements.

Wait, perhaps for each i, the state is the possible value of a_i and the value of a_{i-1}. Because for i+1, the condition depends on a_i and a_{i+1}.

Wait, let's consider the middle elements. For position i (2 <= i <=n-1), the condition is a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But when processing i, we have already processed a_1 to a_i, but a_{i+1} is not yet processed. So the condition for a_i cannot be checked until we process a_{i+1}.

This suggests that the problem can't be solved with a standard left-to-right DP, since the validity of a_i depends on a_{i+1}, which hasn't been processed yet.

Hmm. So perhaps we need to model the DP in a way that allows us to track the necessary information to satisfy the constraints of the previous elements once the next elements are processed.

Another idea: The constraints can be translated into two possibilities for each middle element. Either a_{i+1} >= a_i, which would satisfy the condition regardless of a_{i-1}, or a_{i-1} >= a_i. But a_{i-1} is known when processing i, so perhaps the DP can track the maximum of a_{i} and a_{i-1} for the next steps.

Wait, perhaps for each position i, we track the possible values of a_i and the maximum between a_i and a_{i-1}. Then, when processing i+1, the maximum from the previous step can help determine whether the current a_{i+1} is allowed.

Alternatively, for the DP state, we can track the value of the previous element and the maximum of the previous and current element, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the transitions.

Suppose we have a DP[i][v][m], where v is the value of a_i and m is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i. Then, for the next step i+1, we can transition based on a_{i+1} >= v (if needed) or not.

But the problem is that for i+1, the condition is a_{i+1} <= max(a_i, a_{i+2}).

Wait, but for i+1, the condition depends on a_{i+2}, which is not known yet. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP can track the required constraints that the next element must satisfy. For example, when processing i, the DP state could be the value of a_i and the minimum required value of a_{i+1} to satisfy the current constraints.

Wait, but this might be possible. Let's consider the case where for position i, a_i's value is v. Then, for the previous position (i-1), which has value u, we must have u <= max(a_{i-2}, v). So when processing i-1, we need to have that the max of a_{i-2} and a_i is >= u.

But this again depends on a_i, which is part of the current state.

This seems quite complex. Let's try to find another way.

Let me think about the problem for positions after the first and before the last.

For each i (2 <= i <=n-1), the condition is a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

Which can be rewritten as: max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) >= a_i.

This means that either a_{i-1} >= a_i OR a_{i+1} >= a_i.

But when building the array, since a_{i+1} is unknown at the time of processing a_i, how can we enforce this?

Perhaps, the only way to handle this is to model the DP such that for each i, the value of a_i is allowed to be up to the maximum of the previous and the next element. But since the next element is not known, this approach is not directly feasible.

Alternative approach: For the entire array, for each i (except first and last), a_i must be <= the maximum of its left and right neighbors. This implies that the array cannot have any local maximum that's higher than both neighbors. Because if a_i is a local maximum (higher than both neighbors), then max(left, right) is max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) which is less than a_i, so the condition would not be satisfied. So the array cannot have any local maxima. So the problem is equivalent to ensuring that there are no local maxima except possibly for the first and last elements.

Wait, but the first and last elements have their own constraints. Let's see:

The first element must be <= a_2. So a_1 can be a local maximum only if a_2 is >= a_1, which isn't possible. So the first element cannot be a local maximum. Similarly for the last element.

So the array must have no local maxima. Because for any element except the first and last, the element cannot be greater than both neighbors. So the array is such that there are no peaks (local maxima) except possibly at the ends, but even the ends cannot be peaks.

Wait, the first element's condition is a1 <= a2. So the first element can't be a peak. Similarly, the last element's condition is a_n <= a_{n-1}, so the last element can't be a peak. So the entire array must have no peaks. So the problem reduces to counting all arrays with no peaks, given the constraints of fixed elements.

That's a key insight. So the array must be such that every element (including first and last) is not a peak. So for all elements, it's not the case that the element is greater than both its left and right neighbors. Except that for the first element, there's no left neighbor, so the condition is a1 <= a2. Similarly for the last.

So the array is a sequence where every element is <= at least one neighbor. So the array cannot have any peaks.

So the problem is equivalent to finding the number of such arrays with no peaks, given some elements fixed and others variable.

Now, how to model this with dynamic programming.

The key is to model the transitions between elements such that the next element does not create a peak in the previous elements.

But how?

Let's model the DP for the i-th element. For each possible value of a_i and a_{i-1}, we can track the number of ways to reach this state, ensuring that all previous conditions are met.

But given that n is up to 1e5 and a_i can be up to 200, the state size would be O(n * 200^2), which is 1e5 * 4e4 = 4e9, which is way too big. So this is not feasible.

So we need a way to reduce the state.

Alternative idea: For each position i, track the value of a_i and the maximum of a_i and a_{i-1}. Then, when processing i+1, the maximum of a_i and a_{i+1} must be >= a_{i} (since a_i must be <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})). Wait, but a_{i} <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

If we track the previous maximum (max(a_{i-1}, a_i)), then for the next step, we can compute the necessary conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can track for each position i, the value of a_i and the maximum of a_{i} and a_{i-1}. Let's call this max_so_far. Then, when processing i+1, the condition for a_i is that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But since a_{i-1} and a_i are known, and a_{i+1} is the next variable, perhaps the max_so_far can help in determining the valid transitions.

But I'm not sure. Let's think through the transitions.

For position i, the state is (a_i, prev_max), where prev_max is max(a_{i-1}, a_i).

Then, when processing i+1:

For a_{i+1} to be valid, we need a_{i+1} to satisfy:

1. For a_i: a_i <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}).

But prev_max is already the max of a_{i-1} and a_i. So max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) is the maximum between prev_max and a_{i+1}.

So a_i must be <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}).

But since prev_max is >= a_i (since it's the max of a_{i-1} and a_i), the max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) is at least prev_max, which is >= a_i. So this condition is automatically satisfied. Because a_i <= prev_max, so the max is >= prev_max >= a_i. So the condition a_i <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) is always true.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because prev_max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i. So if prev_max >= a_i, then for the condition a_i <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}), since max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) is >= prev_max >= a_i, this condition is automatically satisfied. So for i >=2, the condition for a_i is automatically satisfied as long as prev_max is tracked correctly.

Wait, that's a breakthrough. So the key insight is that when processing i+1, the condition for a_i is automatically satisfied if the previous transitions are handled correctly.

Because during the DP transitions, for each i, the state (a_i, prev_max) ensures that prev_max is the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_i. Therefore, when processing i+1, the max(a_{i-1}, a_i) is prev_max, and the condition a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is equivalent to a_i <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}).

But since prev_max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i, which is >= a_i, then max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) >= prev_max >= a_i. Therefore, a_i will automatically be <= max(prev_max, a_{i+1}), so the condition for a_i is automatically satisfied.

So the only conditions that need to be enforced when processing i+1 are:

- For a_{i+1} to satisfy its own constraints.

Wait, that's not the case. The constraints for a_{i+1} depend on a_i and a_{i+2}. But in our DP approach, we are processing left to right, so a_{i+2} is not known yet. So how can we enforce the condition for a_{i+1}?

Hmm. Wait, for a_{i+1}, the condition is that a_{i+1} <= max(a_i, a_{i+2}).

But when processing a_{i+1}, we don't know a_{i+2} yet. So how can we model this?

Wait, perhaps the key is that for the DP state at i+1, the maximum between a_i and a_{i+1} (call it curr_max) is tracked. Then, for the next step (i+2), the condition for a_{i+1} is that a_{i+1} <= max(a_i, a_{i+2}).

But again, a_{i+2} is not known yet. So how to model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the condition for a_{i+1} can be split into two possibilities:

Either a_{i+1} <= a_i, which satisfies the condition regardless of a_{i+2}, or a_{i+1} <= a_{i+2}, which must be enforced when processing a_{i+2}.

But how to model this in the DP.

This seems challenging. Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible transitions.

When processing i+1, the current state is (a_i, prev_max). We need to choose a_{i+1} such that:

1. The conditions for a_{i} are already satisfied (which they are, as per the earlier insight).

2. For a_{i+1}, if i+1 is not the last element, then it must satisfy a_{i+1} <= max(a_i, a_{i+2}).

But since a_{i+2} is unknown, this condition can't be checked yet. However, when processing i+1, we can track some information that allows us to enforce this condition when processing i+2.

So the idea is that when processing i+1, we choose a_{i+1} such that either a_{i+1} <= a_i (so that regardless of a_{i+2}, the condition holds), or if a_{i+1} > a_i, then we must ensure that a_{i+1} <= a_{i+2}.

But when processing i+1, we can't know a_{i+2} yet. So the DP state must track that in the next step (i+2), a_{i+2} must be >= a_{i+1} (if a_{i+1} > a_i).

But how to model this in the DP.

So the DP state can track two possibilities for the next element:

- Either the next element (a_{i+1}) is <= a_i, which allows the condition for a_{i+1} to be satisfied regardless of a_{i+2}, OR

- a_{i+1} > a_i, but then a_{i+2} must be >= a_{i+1}.

But the latter case requires that when processing i+2, the a_{i+2} must be >= a_{i+1}.

So the DP state could track the current value a_{i} and the maximum of a_{i} and a_{i-1} (prev_max), and also track any pending constraints from the previous steps.

Wait, but this would complicate the state.

Alternatively, perhaps for each position i, the state is the value of a_i and the minimal value that a_{i+1} must be to satisfy the condition for a_i.

Wait, let's think again. For a_{i}, the condition is that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

When processing i, the a_{i+1} is part of the next step. So during the DP transition from i to i+1, we need to ensure that a_i's condition is satisfied by the chosen a_{i+1} and the previous values.

But since a_{i-1} is known, and a_{i} is part of the state, the max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) must be >= a_i.

So when choosing a_{i+1}, we need to ensure that max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) >= a_i. But since a_{i-1} is part of the previous state's prev_max (which is the max of a_{i-2} and a_{i-1}), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when processing i+1, we need to ensure that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

Which can be rewritten as max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) >= a_i.

Which can be split into two cases:

Either a_{i+1} >= a_i, which satisfies the condition regardless of a_{i-1}, OR a_{i-1} >= a_i.

So during the transition from i to i+1, if a_{i+1} >= a_i, then the condition for a_i is satisfied. If a_{i+1} < a_i, then we must have a_{i-1} >= a_i, which is part of the previous state.

Wait, but a_{i-1} is part of the previous state. So when processing i, the state includes a_i and the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_i (prev_max). So prev_max >= a_i.

So during the transition to i+1, if a_{i+1} < a_i, then the condition for a_i requires that a_{i-1} >= a_i. But since prev_max is the max of a_{i-1} and a_i, and prev_max >= a_i, that implies that a_{i-1} >= a_i only if prev_max == a_{i-1} and a_{i} <= a_{i-1}.

Wait, perhaps during the transition from i to i+1, the condition for a_i is automatically satisfied because prev_max is the max of a_{i-1} and a_i. Let's see:

The condition for a_i is a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But prev_max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i. So if a_{i+1} >= a_i, then max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is max(prev_max, a_{i+1}) >= a_i, so the condition holds.

If a_{i+1} < a_i, then max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is a_{i-1} (since a_{i+1} is less than a_i, which is <= prev_max). But prev_max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i. So if a_{i} <= a_{i-1}, then prev_max is a_{i-1}, and the max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is a_{i-1} >= a_i, which satisfies the condition. But if a_{i} > a_{i-1}, then prev_max is a_i, and then a_{i+1} < a_i. So the max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is a_{i-1} (since a_{i+1} < a_i and a_{i} > a_{i-1} implies a_{i+1} < a_i > a_{i-1}. So the max is a_{i-1} only if a_{i-1} is larger than a_{i+1} and a_i. But in that case, a_{i} is greater than a_{i-1}, which contradicts prev_max being a_i. So in this case, when a_{i} > a_{i-1}, which means prev_max is a_i, then a_{i+1} < a_i would require that max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) >= a_i. But since a_{i-1} is less than a_i, and a_{i+1} is less than a_i, the max would be a_i's a_{i-1} and a_{i+1} are both less than a_i, so the max is a_i. Wait no. Wait, a_{i} is greater than a_{i-1}, and a_{i+1} is less than a_i. So max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is the maximum between a_{i-1} (which is < a_i) and a_{i+1} (also < a_i). So the maximum is less than a_i. So a_i must be <= this maximum, but that's impossible. Hence, the condition for a_i would not be satisfied. So this is a problem.

Wait, this suggests that if a_i > a_{i-1} (i.e., prev_max is a_i), and we choose a_{i+1} < a_i, then the condition for a_i (a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})) is not satisfied. Because the max would be max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) which is less than a_i.

So this would violate the condition. So in this case, we cannot choose a_{i+1} < a_i if a_i > a_{i-1}.

Ah, this is a critical point. So during the transition to i+1, we have to ensure that if a_{i+1} < a_i, then a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) must hold. Which would require that max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) >= a_i.

But if a_{i+1} < a_i, then max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_{i+1}, which are both less than a_i. So this can't be >= a_i. Therefore, in this case, the condition is not satisfied.

So this implies that when a_{i} > a_{i-1} (i.e., prev_max is a_i), we cannot choose a_{i+1} < a_i, because that would violate the condition for a_i.

So the conclusion is that during the transition, if the current state's prev_max is a_i (which implies that a_i > a_{i-1}), then the next a_{i+1} must be >= a_i. Because otherwise, the max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) would be < a_i, violating the condition.

But how do we model this in the DP?

This suggests that the DP state must track whether the previous max was from the current element or the previous one. Because this affects the allowed choices for the next element.

Let's model the DP state as follows:

For each position i, the state is represented by the value of a_i and the value of a_{i-1}. Then, for each possible pair (a_{i-1}, a_i), we can compute the transitions to a_{i+1} ensuring that all conditions are met.

But for n up to 1e5 and a_i up to 200, the state size would be O(200^2 * n), which is 200*200*1e5 = 4e7 operations. That's manageable, but perhaps we can optimize it further.

Alternatively, since the previous max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i, perhaps we can track the max and the current a_i. Let's see:

The state is (current a_i, prev_max). prev_max is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i.

Then, for the next transition to a_{i+1}, we need to:

1. Ensure that the condition for a_i is satisfied. As discussed earlier, if prev_max is a_{i-1}, then a_{i} <= a_{i-1}, so for a_{i+1} < a_i, the condition a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is satisfied since a_{i-1} >= a_i. But if prev_max is a_i (i.e., a_i > a_{i-1}), then a_{i+1} must be >= a_i to satisfy the condition for a_i.

So the next state's a_{i+1} must be >= a_i in that case.

So for the transitions:

If prev_max == a_i (i.e., a_i > a_{i-1}), then the next a_{i+1} must be >= a_i. Because if a_{i+1} < a_i, then max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) is < a_i, which violates the condition.

Therefore, when prev_max is a_i, the next a_{i+1} must be >= a_i.

Otherwise, when prev_max is a_{i-1} (i.e., a_i <= a_{i-1}), then a_{i+1} can be any value, but we have to ensure the condition for a_{i+1} once we process it.

So the DP transitions can be modeled as follows:

For each possible state (a_i, prev_max) at position i:

- If prev_max is a_i (so a_i > a_{i-1}):

   Then a_{i+1} must be >= a_i. So the allowed values for a_{i+1} are from a_i to 200.

   For each such value v >= a_i:

      new_prev_max = max(a_i, v)

      Add to the DP for i+1, state (v, new_prev_max) the number of ways from the current state.

- Else, prev_max is a_{i-1} (a_i <= a_{i-1}):

   Then a_{i+1} can be any value. But for a_{i+1}, we have to consider its own constraints.

   However, for the current step, since the condition for a_i is satisfied (as a_i <= a_{i-1} and a_{i+1} can be anything, but the max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) could be a_{i-1} or a_{i+1}).

   So in this case, when a_{i+1} is chosen, the new_prev_max is max(a_i, a_{i+1}).

So the DP transitions are:

For each (current a_i, prev_max):

   if prev_max == a_i:

       next a_{i+1} must be >= a_i.

   else:

       next a_{i+1} can be any value (1 to 200, subject to the fixed value if present).

So, the state for the next position is (a_{i+1}, max(a_i, a_{i+1})).

Now, we also have to consider the fixed elements. For example, if a_i is fixed to a certain value, then the allowed values for a_i are only that value. Otherwise, all possible values are allowed (1-200).

So, the overall approach is to model the DP with state (current a_i, prev_max), where prev_max is the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_i. For each position i, and for each possible state (v, m), where v is the value of a_i and m is the maximum of a_{i-1} and v, we track the number of ways to reach this state, considering the fixed elements.

The base cases would be for i=1. But i starts from 1, and for the first element, there's no previous element. However, the first element's condition is that a_1 <= a_2. So when i=1, the prev_max is not applicable. Hmm. Wait, this approach seems to start processing from i=2. Maybe I need to adjust the DP for the first two elements.

Let's think about the initial steps.

For i=1 (the first element):

The state is just the value of a_1. The next element (i=2) must be >= a_1. So when processing i=2, the state is (a_2, max(a_1, a_2)).

But for i=1, the DP would have states for a_1, and the transition to i=2 would require a_2 >= a_1.

So the initial state (i=1) can be handled by considering the possible a_1 values (either fixed or 1-200 if -1). For each a_1, when moving to i=2, the a_2 must be >= a_1. So the allowed a_2 values are >= a_1. For each such a_2, the new state is (a_2, max(a_1, a_2)), which is simply a_2 (since a_2 >= a_1).

So for the first transition (i=1 to i=2), the allowed a_2 values are >= a_1. The state for i=2 is (a_2, a_2), since max(a_1, a_2) is a_2.

Now, for the general case:

For each i >=2, the state is (a_i, prev_max), where prev_max is max(a_{i-1}, a_i).

For transitions to i+1:

If prev_max == a_i (which implies a_i >= a_{i-1}):

   a_{i+1} must be >= a_i.

Else (prev_max = a_{i-1}, which implies a_i <= a_{i-1}):

   a_{i+1} can be any valid value (1-200, subject to fixed constraints).

But when transitioning, the new state's prev_max is max(a_i, a_{i+1}).

Additionally, for each position i, if the original array has a fixed value (not -1), then a_i must be that fixed value, so the transitions are restricted to that value.

So the algorithm is as follows:

Initialize the DP for i=1. For each possible a_1 (fixed or 1-200):

   For the next step (i=2), a_2 must be >= a_1.

   So for each allowed a_2 (fixed or >= a_1 if not fixed), compute the state for i=2.

For each subsequent i from 2 to n-1:

   For each state (a_i, prev_max):

       If i is not the last element:

           Determine the allowed a_{i+1} values.

           If the current state's prev_max is a_i (a_i > a_{i-1}):

               a_{i+1} must be >= a_i. So possible values for a_{i+1} are >= a_i.

           Else:

               a_{i+1} can be any valid value.

           Then, check if the next element (a_{i+1}) is fixed. If fixed, then it's allowed only if it meets the above conditions.

           For each allowed a_{i+1}:

               new_prev_max = max(a_i, a_{i+1}).

               Add to the next state (a_{i+1}, new_prev_max) the number of ways from the current state.

       Else (i is the last element):

           For the last element, the condition is a_{i+1} <= a_i. But wait, when i is the last element, i+1 is beyond the array. Wait, no. The last element is i=n. So when processing i=n-1, the next element is i=n.

Wait, the last element's condition is a_n <= a_{n-1}. So when processing i=n, we need to ensure that a_n <= a_{n-1}.

But the DP for i=n is not processed as part of the transitions. So perhaps the last step needs special handling.

Wait, for the last element (i=n), the condition is a_n <= a_{n-1}.

So after processing i=n-1, the transitions to i=n must ensure that a_n <= a_{n-1}.

So during the transition from i=n-1 to i=n:

For each state (a_{n-1}, prev_max), the a_n must be <= a_{n-1}.

But prev_max is the maximum of a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}. For the last element, the condition is a_n <= a_{n-1}.

So the allowed a_n values are <= a_{n-1}.

So during the transition to i=n, the allowed a_n values are <= a_{n-1}.

So the algorithm must handle this.

So the DP steps are:

For i=1 to i=n:

   If i=1:

      Process all possible a_1 values.

      For each a_1, transition to i=2 with a_2 >= a_1.

   For i from 2 to n-1:

      Process each state (a_i, prev_max).

      Compute allowed a_{i+1} values based on prev_max.

      Transition to i+1 with new_prev_max.

   For i =n:

      Process each state (a_{n-1}, prev_max).

      The allowed a_n is <= a_{n-1}.

      So a_n can be any valid value (fixed or 1-200) that is <= a_{n-1}.

So the final step (i=n) must be handled separately.

Now, the problem becomes how to model this DP efficiently.

The key is to note that for each i, the state is (a_i, prev_max), which can be up to 200 * 200 = 4e4 possible states. However, considering that for each i, the state transitions can be handled with O(200) operations per state, the total time complexity is O(n * 200^2) = 1e5 * 4e4 = 4e9 operations. This is way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.

So this approach is not feasible. We need to find a way to optimize the state transitions.

Alternative idea: Since the prev_max is either a_i or a_{i-1}, but we can track the current a_i and the previous maximum (which is either a_{i-1} or a_i). But this doesn't seem to reduce the state size.

Wait, perhaps we can model the state as (a_i, is_prev_max_a_i).

But 'is_prev_max_a_i' is a boolean. So the state is (a_i, bool), which reduces the state space to 200 * 2 = 400 possible states per i.

This could be feasible.

Let me think:

prev_max is the maximum between a_{i-1} and a_i. So prev_max is either a_{i-1} or a_i.

But in the DP state, when moving from i-1 to i, the prev_max for i-1 is max(a_{i-2}, a_{i-1}).

Wait, perhaps for the DP state, we can track the previous a_{i-1} and the current a_i, but that brings back the O(200^2) per i problem.

Alternatively, perhaps we can track the current a_i and whether the previous maximum was a_i (i.e., a_i > a_{i-1}).

So the state is (a_i, is_a_i_prev_max). So for each position i, the state is (a_i, a boolean indicating whether a_i is the maximum of a_{i-1} and a_i).

But how does this help?

When processing i, the state is (current a_i, flag). The flag is true if prev_max == a_i (i.e., a_i > a_{i-1}), else false.

Then, for the next transition to i+1:

If the flag is true:

   a_{i+1} must be >= a_i.

Else:

   a_{i+1} can be any value.

But when transitioning, the new flag for i+1 is whether a_{i+1} is the new maximum between a_i and a_{i+1}.

So the new flag is (a_{i+1} >= a_i).

So the state transitions can be modeled as:

For each state (current_val, flag) at i:

   For the next element a_{i+1}:

      if flag is True:

          allowed a_{i+1} >= current_val.

      else:

          allowed a_{i+1} can be any value.

      (Also considering any fixed values for a_{i+1}.)

      For each allowed next_val:

          new_flag = (next_val >= current_val)

          if new_flag is True:

              new_prev_max = next_val (since next_val >= current_val)

          else:

              new_prev_max = current_val (since current_val > next_val)

          Add to the next state (next_val, new_flag) the number of ways.

But wait, the new_prev_max is max(current_val, next_val). So new_flag is True if next_val >= current_val, else False.

Yes.

So the state is (current_val, flag) where flag indicates whether the previous maximum was current_val (i.e., current_val >= the previous element's value).

This reduces the state to O(200 * 2) = 400 possibilities per i, which is manageable for n up to 1e5.

This is a significant optimization.

So the steps are:

Initialize the DP for i=1.

For i=1, the possible a_1 values are fixed or all possible 1-200.

Then, for each a_1, the next element (i=2) must be >= a_1. So when processing i=2, the allowed a_2 values are >= a_1.

So for each a_1:

   For i=2, a_2 can be any value >= a_1 (subject to fixed constraints), and the new state is (a_2, a_2 >= a_1).

So the new flag is (a_2 >= a_1), which is True.

For i >=2:

   For each state (current_val, flag) at i:

       For the next element a_{i+1}:

           if flag is True:

               a_{i+1} must be >= current_val.

           else:

               a_{i+1} can be any value.

           Then, check if a_{i+1} is fixed. If so, it must be allowed based on the above conditions.

           For each allowed next_val:

               new_flag = (next_val >= current_val)

               new_state is (next_val, new_flag)

               Add to the next state's count the current state's count.

Finally, for the last element (i=n):

   The allowed a_n must be <= a_{n-1}.

   So the state for i=n-1 is (current_val, flag). The flag indicates whether the a_{n-1} is >= a_{n-2} (if flag is True, then a_{n-1} is the max between a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}).

   For the transition to i=n:

       a_n must be <= current_val (since a_{n} must be <= a_{n-1}).

       So next_val must be <= current_val.

       The new state is (a_n, ...), but since it's the last element, we don't need to track further states. We just need to sum all valid possibilities for a_n.

So, the final step is to sum over all possible states for i=n-1 and all possible a_n values that are <= current_val (i=n-1's current_val) and meet the fixed a_n constraint.

Putting it all together:

The DP transitions are as follows:

- For each position i from 1 to n-1:

   For each state (current_val, flag):

       If i == 1:

           next_val (a_2) must be >= current_val (since a_1 <= a_2 is required).

       else:

           if flag is True:

               next_val must be >= current_val (because a_{i} is the max of a_{i-1} and a_i, so a_{i+1} must be >= current_val to satisfy a_i's condition).

           else:

               next_val can be any value (since a_i <= a_{i-1}, and the condition for a_i is satisfied via a_i <= a_{i-1}).

       Then, for the next_val, check if it meets the fixed value in the array (if any).

       For each allowed next_val:

           new_flag = (next_val >= current_val)

           update the DP for i+1 accordingly.

For the last element (i=n):

   For each state (current_val, flag) in i=n-1:

       a_n must be <= current_val.

       So allowed next_val (a_n) is <= current_val, and must match the fixed value in the array (if any).

       Sum the count of all valid a_n values.

Now, the problem is to manage the transitions efficiently, considering the fixed values.

Let's think about handling the fixed values in the input array.

For each position i, if a_i is not -1, then the value of a_i must be fixed. So during the DP transitions, for any state at i, current_val must be equal to the fixed a_i. If the fixed a_i is not compatible with the state, then the count for that state is zero.

So during the initialization of each position, we need to check whether the current_val is allowed (i.e., matches the fixed value if present). If not, then that state's count is zero.

This can be handled by, for each position i, checking if a_i is fixed. For example, during the transition to i, if the current_val does not match the fixed a_i (if any), then that state is invalid and is ignored.

So the steps would be:

For each position i from 1 to n:

   If the input array has a_i not equal to -1:

       All current_val in the DP state must be equal to a_i.

       So for any state (current_val, flag) at i, if current_val != a_i, then it's invalid and contributes zero.

   Else:

       current_val can be any value from 1 to 200.

So during the processing of each position i, we filter the states based on whether they match the fixed a_i value (if any).

This ensures that the fixed values are respected.

Now, let's model this in code.

We can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries or two arrays for the current and next states. Given that each state is (current_val, flag), and current_val can be 1-200, and flag is True or False, we can use two 2D arrays: previous_dp and current_dp, where previous_dp[v][f] represents the number of ways to reach state (v, f) at position i.

But given the constraints of Python's speed, we need to optimize this.

Let's consider using two dictionaries for the current and next DP states. But for better performance, using two arrays of size [201][2] (since current_val ranges from 1 to 200, and flag is 0 or 1) would be more efficient.

So for each position i, we have a DP array of size 201 x 2 (since current_val can be 0 to 200, but 0 is not allowed, so maybe 201 entries to allow 1-based indexing).

But in Python, even with this, the code can be optimized using lists.

So the plan is:

- For each position i, we track the DP as a 2D array (201 x 2) where dp[v][f] is the number of ways to reach value v with flag f at position i.

- For each i, initialize the current_dp to all zeros.

- For each transition, iterate over all possible current_val and flag combinations, and for each, compute the allowed next_val and new_flag, and update the next_dp accordingly.

- For fixed a_i, we only allow current_val equal to the fixed value. So during processing i, if a[i] is not -1, then for all current_val != a[i], their counts are zero.

Let's outline the code step by step.

First, read the input:

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
MOD = 998244353

Then, initialize the DP for i=1.

But wait, for i=1, the state is (current_val, flag). However, since i=1 is the first element, the flag is irrelevant. Wait, no. Because the flag is determined by the previous step.

Wait, for i=1, the flag represents whether the previous max (from i=0 and i=1) is current_val. But i=1 is the first element, so there is no i=0. So the previous max is just current_val. So the flag is always True (since max(a_0, a_1) is a_1, but since a_0 doesn't exist, perhaps the flag is not applicable for i=1. However, for the transition to i=2, the next_val must be >= a_1. So the flag for i=1 is not used. The transition to i=2 must enforce that next_val >= a_1.

Wait, perhaps the flag is not needed for i=1. The initial state for i=1 is just the current_val. For the transition to i=2, the allowed next_val must be >= current_val.

So the initial setup for i=1 is as follows:

current_dp is a dictionary (or array) where for each possible current_val (1-200, or fixed), we set the count to 1 if the value is allowed. Then, when transitioning to i=2, the allowed next_val must be >= current_val.

So for i=1:

if a[0] is -1:

   for v in 1..200:

       count[v] = 1

else:

   v = a[0]

   count[v] = 1

Then, for each possible current_val in i=1, the next_val (i=2) must be >= current_val. And for i=2, the new_flag is next_val >= current_val (which is always True in this case, since next_val >= current_val).

But this is a special case, so perhaps we can handle i=1 separately.

Let's structure the code as follows:

Initialize dp_prev as the state for i=1.

if a[0] is not -1:

   allowed_values = [a[0]]

else:

   allowed_values = range(1, 201)

Then, dp_prev is a dictionary where each key is (v, flag), but for i=1, the flag is not used. Wait, but for the transition to i=2, we need to know whether the next_val >= current_val (a_1).

So for i=2, the flag is next_val >= a_1 (current_val). But next_val must be >= a_1, so the flag for i=2 is always True.

Thus, when transitioning from i=1 to i=2, the new_flag is always True.

So for i=2:

   new_val must be >= a_1.

   new_flag is new_val >= a_1 (which is True).

So during the transition from i=1 to i=2, the new_flag is True.

So for i=1:

   current_val can be any allowed value (based on fixed).

   For each current_val, the next_val (i=2) must be >= current_val.

Thus, for i=1, the DP is a single value (current_val), and the transition to i=2 requires next_val >= current_val.

But given the flag model, for i=2, the flag is new_val >= current_val, which is True.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Initialize dp_prev as a dictionary where for each allowed current_val in i=1, the count is 1.

Then, for i=2 to n-1:

   For each state in dp_prev (current_val, flag):

       compute the allowed next_val.

       if i is not n:

           if flag is True:

               allowed_next_val >= current_val.

           else:

               allowed_next_val any.

           check if next_val is allowed (fixed or in 1-200).

           for each allowed_next_val:

               new_flag = next_val >= current_val.

               update dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += dp_prev[current_val][flag]

   For the last transition (i=n-1 to i=n):

       allowed_next_val (a_n) must be <= current_val.

       check if next_val matches the fixed a_n (if any).

       sum all possible next_val <= current_val and multiply by the dp_prev counts.

So, the code can be structured with nested loops.

But given the time constraints, we need to optimize this with precomputed ranges and cumulative sums.

Let's think about how to handle the transitions efficiently.

For each state (current_val, flag) in dp_prev:

   For i <n-1:

       if flag is True:

           allowed_next_val is >= current_val.

       else:

           allowed_next_val can be any.

       But next_val must be compatible with the fixed a[i] (for the current i).

       So, for example, if a[i] is fixed to x, then next_val must be x.

       So for each i, the allowed_next_val is determined by the current a[i] (if not -1).

   So for each step:

       if the current i's a[i] is not -1:

           allowed_next_val is a[i].

           check if allowed_next_val satisfies the conditions (>= current_val if flag is True).

           if yes:

               new_flag = next_val >= current_val.

               add to dp_next.

       else:

           generate all allowed_next_val based on flag and current_val.

           for each next_val:

               check if it's allowed (1-200)

               add to dp_next.

But iterating over all next_val for each current_val and flag would be O(200 * 200) per step, which is 4e4 per i. For n=1e5, this is 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, we need to find a way to compute the transitions in O(200) per step.

The key idea is to use prefix sums and suffix sums to compute the transitions in batches.

For example, when the flag is True, the allowed_next_val is >= current_val. So for each current_val, the allowed range is [current_val, 200]. We can precompute the cumulative sums for the next_val ranges and use them to update the dp_next in O(1) per current_val.

Similarly, when the flag is False, allowed_next_val is any value (1-200), so the allowed range is [1, 200].

If the next_val is fixed, we can directly check whether it's in the allowed range and update accordingly.

So the plan is:

For each i from 1 to n-1:

   precompute the next_val possibilities based on the current a[i] (fixed or not).

   if a[i] is fixed:

       next_val must be a[i]. So for each state (current_val, flag) in dp_prev:

           check if a[i] is in the allowed range (>= current_val if flag is True).

           if yes:

               new_flag = (a[i] >= current_val)

               dp_next[a[i]][new_flag] += dp_prev[current_val][flag]

   else:

       for each state (current_val, flag) in dp_prev:

           if flag is True:

               allowed_next_val >= current_val.

               the sum for new_flag True is next_val >= current_val.

               for new_flag True: next_val >= current_val.

               new_flag is True if next_val >= current_val.

               So, the allowed next_val is [current_val, 200], and new_flag is True.

               So, the number of ways contributed is dp_prev[current_val][flag] multiplied by the number of valid next_val in this range.

               But wait, no: each next_val in the range is added as a separate state (next_val, new_flag).

               But when a[i] is not fixed, the next_val can be any in the allowed range.

               So, for each next_val in [current_val, 200], the new_flag is next_val >= current_val (True).

               So the dp_next[next_val][True] += dp_prev[current_val][flag]

               This would take O(200) per state, which is not feasible.

               So we need to find a way to compute this in O(1) per current_val.

               For example, for current_val and flag True:

                   allowed_next_val >= current_val.

                   the new_flag is True for all these next_val.

                   So the contribution to dp_next is adding dp_prev[current_val][flag] to each next_val in [current_val, 200].

               This can be represented as a range update. In Python, we can't do this directly, but we can use prefix sums.

               So for each current_val and flag:

                   if flag is True:

                       start = current_val

                       end = 200

                       new_flag = True

                       dp_next[start][new_flag] += count

                       dp_next[end + 1][new_flag] -= count

                   else:

                       for next_val 1 to 200:

                           new_flag = next_val >= current_val

                           dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += count

               But this approach is still O(200) per state for the else case.

               So it's still O(200^2) per i.

               To optimize, we can precompute the contributions for each possible current_val and flag.

               For the flag True case, the allowed next_val is a range. So we can compute the sum for that range and use prefix sums to apply the contribution to all next_val in the range.

               Similarly, for the flag False case, allowed next_val is all 200 values. So the contribution to new_flag is True when next_val >= current_val, else False.

               This can be split into two ranges:

                   next_val >= current_val: new_flag is True.

                   next_val < current_val: new_flag is False.

               So for each current_val and flag False:

                   contribution to new_flag True is the number of next_val >= current_val.

                   contribution to new_flag False is the number of next_val < current_val.

               But this is only possible if the next_val is not fixed. For example, when a[i] is not fixed, we can calculate the number of next_val that meet the criteria and multiply by the dp_prev count.

               But this would require that the next_val is allowed to be any value. However, the problem requires that next_val is between 1 and 200.

               So for a[i] not fixed:

                   for flag True:

                       next_val can be from current_val to 200 → 200 - current_val + 1 options.

                       each contributes new_flag True.

                   for flag False:

                       next_val can be any from 1 to 200.

                       new_flag is True if next_val >= current_val → 200 - current_val + 1 options.

                       new_flag is False otherwise → current_val - 1 options.

               So for the flag True case, the number of ways is dp_prev[current_val][flag] multiplied by the number of allowed next_val (which is 200 - current_val + 1).

               But this is only valid if the next_val is not fixed. If next_val is fixed, then we have to check if it's in the allowed range.

               But when a[i] is not fixed (next_val can vary), the transitions can be optimized by precomputing for each current_val and flag:

                   the contribution to new_flag True and new_flag False.

               For example:

                   current_val = v, flag = True.

                   allowed next_val is >= v.

                   each next_val in [v, 200] contributes to new_flag True.

                   So for each such next_val, the count is added to dp_next[next_val][True].

                   But summing over all next_val is equivalent to adding dp_prev[v][True] multiplied by the number of possible next_val in the allowed range.

                   But this is only correct if the next_val is not fixed. When next_val is not fixed, each possible next_val in the allowed range is considered, and their new_flag is determined.

                   However, the problem requires that each next_val is counted as a separate possibility, not just the number of options.

               So this suggests that the initial approach of iterating through all possible next_val is necessary, but with optimizations.

               So perhaps we can precompute for each current_val and flag the sum over allowed next_val, and for each next_val and new_flag, accumulate the sums.

               But how?

               For example:

               For each i, if a[i] is not fixed:

                   for each current_val and flag:

                       if flag is True:

                           allowed_next_val is [v, 200], where v is current_val.

                           for each next_val in [v, 200], new_flag is True.

                           So the contribution to new_flag=True is sum of dp_prev[current_val][flag] over all next_val in [v, 200].

                       else:

                           allowed_next_val is [1, 200].

                           for next_val >= current_val: new_flag=True.

                           for next_val < current_val: new_flag=False.

                           So contribution to new_flag=True is sum of dp_prev[current_val][flag] * (200 - current_val + 1).

                           contribution to new_flag=False is sum of dp_prev[current_val][flag] * (current_val - 1).

               But this is only the case when a[i] is not fixed. When a[i] is fixed, then next_val is a single value.

               So the code can be optimized by:

                   precomputing for each current_val and flag, the number of allowed next_val and their new_flags, and multiply by the current count.

               This way, the transitions can be done in O(200) per i.

               For example:

               When a[i] is not fixed and flag is True:

                   the number of allowed next_val is (200 - current_val + 1).

                   each of these next_val contributes to new_flag=True.

                   So for new_flag=True, dp_next[next_val][True] += dp_prev[current_val][flag] for each next_val in [current_val, 200].

                   This can be represented as adding to a prefix sum array for new_flag=True.

               Similarly, for flag=False:

                   the number of next_val >= current_val is (200 - current_val + 1), contributing to new_flag=True.

                   the number of next_val < current_val is (current_val -1), contributing to new_flag=False.

                   So for each current_val, the contribution to new_flag=True is dp_prev[current_val][False] * (200 - current_val + 1).

                   And to new_flag=False is dp_prev[current_val][False] * (current_val -1).

               However, this approach is only valid when a[i] is not fixed. When a[i] is fixed, we need to check if the fixed value is in the allowed range and update accordingly.

               So the code can be structured as follows:

               For each i from 1 to n-1:

                   next_val_fixed = a[i] if a[i] != -1 else None

                   for current_val in 1..200:

                       for flag in 0, 1:

                           count = dp_prev[current_val][flag]

                           if count == 0:

                               continue

                           if next_val_fixed is not None:

                               next_val = next_val_fixed

                               if flag and next_val < current_val:

                                   continue  # not allowed

                               new_flag = next_val >= current_val

                               dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += count

                               dp_next[next_val][new_flag] %= MOD

                           else:

                               if flag:

                                   # allowed next_val >= current_val

                                   start = current_val

                                   end = 200

                                   # contribute to new_flag=True for all next_val in [start, end]

                                   # this is a range update from start to end for new_flag=True

                                   # can be done with prefix sums

                                   dp_next[start][1] += count

                                   if end + 1 <= 200:

                                       dp_next[end+1][1] -= count

                               else:

                                   # allowed next_val is any

                                   # split into two ranges: next_val >= current_val and < current_val

                                   # new_flag=True for next_val >= current_val

                                   start_true = current_val

                                   end_true = 200

                                   # new_flag=False for next_val < current_val

                                   start_false = 1

                                   end_false = current_val - 1

                                   # apply range updates

                                   if start_true <= end_true:

                                       dp_next[start_true][1] += count

                                       if end_true +1 <= 200:

                                           dp_next[end_true+1][1] -= count

                                   if start_false <= end_false:

                                       dp_next[start_false][0] += count

                                       if end_false +1 <= 200:

                                           dp_next[end_false+1][0] -= count

                   # After processing all current_val and flags, convert the prefix sums to actual counts

                   for new_flag in 0, 1:

                       current_sum = 0

                       for next_val in 1..200:

                           current_sum += dp_next[next_val][new_flag]

                           dp_next[next_val][new_flag] = current_sum % MOD

               This way, for each i, the transitions can be done in O(200) time using prefix sums.

               This approach would reduce the time complexity to O(n * 200) steps, which is 1e5 * 200 = 2e7 operations, manageable in Python.

               So the code will use this approach.

               Now, the final step is to handle the last element (i=n).

               For i=n:

                   the a[n-1] (i=n-1 in code) must be processed.

                   the allowed next_val (a_n) must be <= current_val.

                   next_val can be any value from 1 to current_val (inclusive), and must match the fixed a_n if present.

               So for the last step:

                   total = 0

                   for current_val in 1..200:

                       for flag in 0, 1:

                           count = dp_prev[current_val][flag]

                           if count == 0:

                               continue

                           next_val = a[n-1]

                           if next_val != -1:

                               if next_val > current_val:

                                   continue

                               total = (total + count) % MOD

                           else:

                               # next_val can be 1..current_val

                               total = (total + count * current_val) % MOD

                   print(total)

               So for the last element, we sum over all possible current_val and flag, and multiply by the number of allowed next_val (1..current_val) if a[n-1] is not fixed. If it is fixed, check if next_val <= current_val.

               But how to compute the sum of allowed next_val for the last element:

                   if a[n-1] is -1: allowed next_val is 1..current_val → current_val options.

                   So the contribution is count * current_val.

               So the code for the last step is:

               last_val = a[-1]

               total = 0

               for current_val in 1..200:

                   for flag in 0, 1:

                       cnt = dp_prev[current_val][flag]

                       if cnt == 0:

                           continue

                       if last_val != -1:

                           if last_val > current_val:

                               continue

                           total = (total + cnt) % MOD

                       else:

                           total = (total + cnt * current_val) % MOD

               print(total % MOD)

               Now, putting this all together.

               Now, considering the code structure:

               - The code uses two arrays for the current and previous DP states: dp_prev and dp_next.

               - For each i, after handling the transitions, the prefix sums are computed.

               - For the last step, the sum is computed based on the allowed next_val.

               So the code in Python would look like this:

               But to handle the prefix sums efficiently, we can use two arrays of size 201 (indexes 0 to 200) for each flag.

               Now, let's write the code step by step.

               First, read the input:

               n = int(input())
               a = list(map(int, input().split()))
               MOD = 998244353

               Then, handle the case when n=1 is not possible since n >=2.

               But the problem states n >=2.

               Now, initialize the DP for i=1.

               dp_prev is a 201 x 2 array (indexes 0 to 200 for current_val, 0-1 for flag).

               However, since current_val is from 1 to 200, we can use 1-based indexing.

               So:

               dp_prev = [[0]*2 for _ in range(201)]  # current_val: 0-200 (0 unused), flag 0/1

               first element is a[0], which is i=1 in the problem (0-based index in the list).

               if a[0] == -1:

                   for v in range(1, 201):

                       dp_prev[v][0] = 1  # flag is 0, but wait, flag is not used for i=1?

               else:

                   v = a[0]

                   dp_prev[v][0] = 1

               Wait, for i=1, the flag is not applicable. But the transition to i=2 requires that next_val >= a_1. So the initial flag is not part of the state for i=1. However, in the code model, the transition to i=2 must consider whether the next_val >= a_1.

               Wait, for i=1, the flag is not part of the state. So perhaps the initial state is current_val for i=1, and the transition to i=2 is handled as a special case.

               This suggests that the code should handle i=1 separately.

               So, for i=1 (first element):

                   current_val can be any allowed value (1-200 if a[0] is -1, else fixed).

                   when transitioning to i=2, the next_val must be >= current_val.

                   So for i=1, the DP is just a single current_val, and the next_val must be >= current_val.

               So for i=1, the code can be:

               # Initialize for i=1 (first element)
               current_val_list = []
               if a[0] == -1:
                   current_val_list = range(1, 201)
               else:
                   current_val_list = [a[0]]

               # Initialize dp_prev for i=1
               dp_prev = [0] * (201)
               for v in current_val_list:
                   dp_prev[v] = 1

               Then, for i=2 to n-1:

                   # i is 1-based in code?

                   # For code, the array a is 0-based.

                   # For the current i (processing a[i-1])

                   current_i = i-1  # because the array is 0-based.

                   next_val_fixed = a[current_i] if a[current_i] != -1 else None

                   dp_next = [[0]*2 for _ in range(201)]

                   for current_val in range(1, 201):

                       # Process flag 0 and 1?

                       # Wait, for i=2, the previous flag is from i=1's transition.

                       # Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.

                       # Let's clarify:

                       # For i=1 (code's i=1), the state is (current_val, 0), but this is part of the initial setup.

                       # After initial setup, for i=2 to n-1:

                           # i corresponds to the code's loop variable.

                           # for each step, the current_i is i-1 in the array.

                           # So for code's loop variable i in 2 to n-1:

                               # current_i = i-1 in the array.

                               # a[current_i] is the current a[i] in the array.

                               # next_val_fixed is a[current_i] if not -1.

                   Sorry, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think again.

                   The code's a array is 0-based. So for the first element, it's a[0], which is i=1 in the problem statement.

                   For the second element, it's a[1], which is i=2 in the problem statement.

                   So for the code's loop from i=1 to n-1:

                       current_i in the array is i-1.

                       So for code's loop variable i:

                           current_i = i-1.

                           if i ==1:

                               handle the first element.

                           else:

                               handle transitions from i-1 to i.

                   But perhaps it's easier to think of the code's loop variable as iterating from 1 to n-1:

                       for i in range(1, n):

                           handle transitions from i to i+1.

                   So for i in 1 to n-1:

                       current element is a[i-1], and next element is a[i].

                   So, the code's loop runs for i from 1 to n-1 (processing the i-th element in the problem's 1-based array).

                   Now, after handling i=1 (the first element), we need to process i=2 to i=n-1 (problem's indices).

                   So for each i in 2 to n-1:

                       process the transitions from i-1 to i.

                   So, the code's loop would look like:

                   for step in range(1, n):

                       current_i = step -1

                       next_val_fixed = a[current_i] if a[current_i] != -1 else None

                       ...

                   But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

                   Let's try to code it step by step.

                   First, handle the first element:

                   Initialize dp_prev.

                   Then, for each step from 2 to n-1 (problem's i=2 to i=n-1):

                       process the transitions.

                   Then, handle the last element.

                   So, code steps:

                   Read n and a.

                   Handle first element.

                   Initialize dp_prev.

                   For step in 2 to n-1:

                       process transitions.

                   Handle last element.

                   Now, the code for the transitions:

                   After the first step, for each subsequent step:

                       current_i = step-1 (since the first step is step=2, current_i=1, which is a[1]).

                       next_val_fixed = a[current_i] if a[current_i] != -1 else None.

                       Initialize dp_next to zero.

                       if next_val_fixed is not None:

                           # fixed next_val

                           next_val = next_val_fixed

                           for current_val in 1..200:

                               for flag in 0,1:

                                   cnt = dp_prev[current_val][flag]

                                   if cnt ==0:

                                       continue

                                   if flag == 1 and next_val < current_val:

                                       # invalid transition

                                       continue

                                   new_flag = 1 if next_val >= current_val else 0

                                   dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += cnt

                           # apply prefix sums for new_flag 0 and 1.

                           for new_flag in 0,1:

                               current_sum =0

                       dp_prev = dp_next

                   Finally, handle the last element (i=n):

                       next_val = a[n-1]

                       total =0

                       for current_val in 1..200:

                           for flag in 0,1:

                               cnt = dp_prev[current_val][flag]

                               if next_val !=-1:

                                   if next_val > current_val:

                                       continue

                                   total = (total + cnt) % MOD

                               else:

                                   total = (total + cnt * current_val) % MOD

                       print(total % MOD)

                   Now, converting this to code.

                   However, in Python, handling the prefix sums efficiently requires careful implementation.

                   Let's proceed with the code.

                   First, the initial setup:

                   n = int(input())
                   a = list(map(int, input().split()))
                   MOD = 998244353

                   if n == 1:
                       # impossible since n >=2 per problem statement.
                       pass

                   # Initialize for i=1 (first element)
                   dp_prev = [0] * (201)  # index 0 unused, 1-200
                   if a[0] == -1:
                       for v in range(1, 201):
                           dp_prev[v] = 1
                   else:
                       v = a[0]
                       dp_prev[v] = 1

                   # Convert dp_prev to the new state format (current_val, flag)
                   # Wait, no. The initial setup is for i=1, which has no flags. The transition to i=2 requires that next_val >= current_val.

                   # For i=1, the next element is i=2 (problem's i=2, code's a[1]).

                   # So after the first step, for the transition to i=2, the allowed next_val is >= current_val.

                   # So the first transition is handled differently.

                   # So, for the first transition (i=1 to i=2):

                   # Initialize dp_prev for i=1 as a single current_val.

                   # For each current_val in i=1, the next_val must be >= current_val.

                   # So code for the first transition:

                   # Handle step 2 (i=2 in problem's terms)

                   # So the code for the first transition (i=1 to i=2):

                   current_i = 1-1 =0 ?

                   Perhaps the code should start with processing step 2.

                   But this is getting very complicated. To avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to handle the first transition separately.

                   Here's the plan:

                   - Initialize the DP for i=1 (first element).

                   - For each i from 2 to n-1:

                       - Process the transitions from i-1 to i.

                   - Finally, process the last element.

                   So code:

                   # After initializing dp_prev for i=1.

                   for i in range(2, n):
                       current_a = a[i-1]  # since i-1 is the index for the current element in the array.
                       # current_a is the a[i-1] in the array (problem's i-th element)

                       # create dp_next initialized to zero.
                       dp_next = [[0]*2 for _ in range(201)]

                       if current_a != -1:
                           next_val = current_a
                           for current_val in range(1, 201):
                               for flag in [0, 1]:
                                   cnt = dp_prev[current_val][flag]
                                   if cnt ==0:
                                       continue
                                   if flag ==1 and next_val < current_val:
                                       continue
                                   new_flag = 1 if next_val >= current_val else 0
                                   dp_next[next_val][new_flag] = (dp_next[next_val][new_flag] + cnt) % MOD
                       else:
                           # Use prefix sums for transitions
                           # First handle flag=1 (next_val >= current_val)
                           prefix = [ [0]*201 for _ in range(2) ]
                           for current_val in range(1, 201):
                               for flag in [0, 1]:

                   print(total % MOD)

                   But this code has some issues, such as handling the first transition from i=1 to i=2 correctly.

                   For example, the first iteration of the loop (i=2) will process the transition from i=1 to i=2. But the initial dp_prev is for i=1, which is a single array, not a 201x2 array.

                   So the code needs to be adjusted to handle the first transition correctly.

                   The initial dp_prev is a single array (201 elements), which represents the count for each current_val in i=1, without flags. So for the first transition (i=1 to i=2), we need to convert this into the new state format (current_val, flag).

                   Wait, no. The first transition to i=2 must handle the flag.

                   Wait, for i=2, the flag is whether the next_val >= current_val (which is the case for i=1).

                   For the first transition (i=1 to i=2):

                       next_val must be >= current_val.

                       So for each current_val in i=1, the next_val can be >= current_val.

                       For each such next_val, the new_flag is 1 (since next_val >= current_val).

                   So the initial dp_prev for i=1 is a single array (current_val counts).

                   For the transition to i=2, the next_val must be >= current_val.

                   So for each current_val in dp_prev:

                       if a[1] is fixed:

                           next_val = a[1]

                           if next_val >= current_val:

                               new_flag = 1 (next_val >= current_val)

                               dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += dp_prev[current_val]

                       else:

                           for next_val in current_val to 200:

                               new_flag = 1

                               dp_next[next_val][new_flag] += dp_prev[current_val]

                   So the code for the first transition must be handled separately.

                   This suggests that the code needs to handle the first transition outside of the loop, then proceed with the loop.

                   So the code structure would be:

                   Initialize dp_prev for i=1.

                   Handle the transition to i=2.

                   Then, loop from i=3 to i=n-1.

                   Finally, handle the last element.

                   So the code would be:

                   n = int(input())
                   a = list(map(int, input().split()))
                   MOD = 998244353

                       pass

                   initial_dp = [0] * 201  # 1-based

                   print(total % MOD)

                   This code should handle the first transition separately and then proceed with the loop.

                   Now, let's test this code against the sample inputs.

                   Sample input 1:

3
1 -1 2

The array is [1, -1, 2].

For i=1 (initial element), current_val is 1.

Transition to i=2 (second element, a[1] is -1). So next_val can be >=1.

The code for the first transition (i=2) allows next_val >=1.

But since a[1] is -1, the code uses prefix sums to add 1 to all next_val >=1.

So dp_prev for i=2 is:

next_val ranges from 1 to 200.

For new_flag=1 (next_val >=1), the count for each next_val is 1.

But the next element is the second element (i=2 in the problem), which is a[1] = -1.

So for i=3 (third element in code's loop?), the current_a is a[2] = 2.

But in the code's loop for i in range(3, n), where n=3, the loop doesn't execute.

So after handling i=2, the code processes the last element.

The last_val is 2.

For the last element, the code checks if 2 <= current_val (which is the current_val in i=2's state).

For i=2, the state is (current_val, flag).

For example, during the first transition (i=1 to i=2), next_val can be any >=1.

But the third element is fixed to 2, which is a[2] = 2.

So the last_val is 2.

In the last step, for each current_val in i=2's state, we check if 2 <= current_val.

 current_val can be any >=1 (since i=2's next_val is >=1).

But in i=2's state, current_val is >=1, and the flag is 1 (since next_val >= current_val).

So for each current_val >=1:

   last_val is 2.

   if current_val >=2, then 2 <= current_val is allowed.

   else (current_val=1), 2 <=1 is false.

So only current_val >=2 contribute.

But in the initial transition to i=2, the allowed next_val is >=1. So current_val can be 1, 2, ..., 200.

But the third element is fixed to 2. So during the transition from i=2 to i=3 (the last element), which is the third element in the problem's array (a[2] = 2), the code checks if 2 <= current_val.

For example, current_val is 1: 2 <=1 is false.

 current_val is 2: 2 <=2 is true.

 current_val is 3: 2 <=3 is true.

 etc.

But for the code's last step, the current_val in i=2's state is the value of a_2 (second element), which is variable.

But the third element's a_3 is fixed to 2.

So for the last step:

For current_val in i=2's state (which is the value of the second element):

   if current_val >=2, then the third element can be 2.

   else, current_val <2, so 2 <= current_val is false.

So the valid current_val in i=2's state are >=2.

But in the initial transition to i=2, the allowed values for next_val are >=1.

So for i=2's state, current_val is 1, 2, ..., 200.

For each of these, the count is 1.

So during the last step, the total is the sum of counts for current_val >=2.

How many current_val are >=2?

 current_val ranges from 1 to 200.

 current_val >=2: 199 values (2 to 200).

 So the total is 199 * 1 = 199?

 But the sample output is 1.

Hmm, this suggests that there's an error in the code.

Wait, what's wrong here?

Let me re-express the problem.

In the first sample input:

3
1 -1 2

The array must be restored to [1, x, 2].

The conditions:

a_1 =1 <= a_2 → x >=1.

a_3=2 <= a_2 → x >=2.

For the middle element x, it must be <= max(a_1, a_3) = max(1, 2) = 2. So x <=2.

So x must be >=2 (from a_3's condition) and <=2 (from the middle element's condition). So x=2.

Thus, there's only 1 way.

But according to the code's last step:

current_val is the value of a_2 (x). The third element is 2, which must be <= x.

So during the last step, the code checks if 2 <= current_val (x).

But the current_val is x, which for a_2 is variable (could be >=1).

But in the code's processing of i=2 (problem's i=2), the a[1] (second element) is -1.

So during the first transition (i=2), the code allows next_val (x) >=1.

Thus, x can be any value from 1 to 200.

But the third element is fixed to 2, which must be <=x.

So x must be >=2.

But during the last step, the code sums the counts of current_val (x) >=2.

But in the first transition, the code allows x >=1. So the count for each x >=1 is 1.

But the third element is fixed to 2, so x must be >=2.

Thus, the total number of ways is the number of x >=2 and x <= max(1, 2) =2 → x=2.

Thus, the code should output 1.

But according to the code's last step, the code would sum all x >=2, but in reality, x must also satisfy the middle element's condition (x <= max(1, 2) =2).

But the code's model doesn't account for this, because the middle element's condition is not handled.

Ah! Here's the problem. The code's current model ensures that each element's conditions are handled during transitions, but for the middle elements, the model assumes that the conditions are automatically satisfied.

But in reality, the middle element's condition is that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

The code's model only ensures that during the transition from i to i+1, the current a_i's condition is satisfied.

But for middle elements, their conditions depend on the next element (a_{i+1}), which is part of the transitions.

But according to the earlier analysis, the code's model automatically satisfies the conditions for middle elements by ensuring that during transitions, the next_val is allowed.

But in the sample input 1, during the transition from i=2 to i=3 (last element), the code checks that a_3 <= a_2, but the middle element's condition (i=2) is a_2 <= max(a_1, a_3) = max(1, a_3).

But a_3 is fixed to 2. So max(1, 2) =2. So a_2 <=2.

So the code's model ensures that during the transition to i=2, the allowed a_2 is >= a_1 (1), but during the transition to i=3, the code checks that a_3 (2) <= a_2.

But this leaves a_2 >=2.

Thus, a_2 must be >=2 and <=2 → a_2=2.

Thus, the total number of ways is 1.

But according to the code's calculation:

During the transition to i=2, the code allows a_2 >=1. So the count for a_2=2 is 1.

During the last step, a_3=2 must be <= a_2. So the code sums all a_2 >=2.

But during the transition to i=2, the code allowed a_2 to be any >=1. However, the middle element's condition (a_2 <= max(a_1, a_3)) must also be checked.

But according to the code's model, this condition is automatically satisfied.

But in reality, the code's model does not account for this condition. The code's model assumes that the transition to i+1 ensures the current a_i's condition is satisfied.

But according to the earlier analysis, this is handled by the model.

Wait, the model's state tracks the current a_i and the previous max, and during transitions, the model ensures that the next_val is allowed based on the previous state's flag.

But in the sample input 1, the code's model may not have considered the middle element's condition.

So perhaps the code's model is incorrect.

This suggests that the code's approach is missing a crucial step in handling the middle element's condition.

But according to the earlier analysis, the code's model ensures that each a_i's condition is satisfied by the transitions. For example, during the transition from i to i+1, the code ensures that a_i's condition is satisfied by ensuring that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_i+1).

But according to the model's logic:

For a_i's condition, the code ensures that during the transition to i+1, the next_val is chosen such that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, next_val).

The code's model ensures that this is the case by allowing next_val >= a_i when a_i is the previous max (flag is True).

But in the sample input 1, a_i (a_2) is 2. The code's model allows a_2 to be >=1. But the condition a_2 <= max(a_1, a_3) is max(1, 2) =2. So a_2 must be <=2. However, in the code's model, this condition is not checked.

So the code's model is missing the condition for the middle elements.

Thus, the code is incorrect.

This suggests that the model is incorrect and the approach needs to be revised.

But this is a problem.

The key mistake in the model is that it assumes that the transitions ensure that a_i's condition is satisfied, but it doesn't account for the fact that the next_val (a_{i+1}) must allow a_i to be <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

But according to the earlier analysis, when a_i is part of the state with flag indicating whether a_i is the previous max, the model ensures that during transitions, the a_i's condition is automatically satisfied.

But the sample input shows that this is not the case.

So what's wrong with the model?

Let's re-examine the model.

For the middle elements, the code's model tracks the current a_i and whether the previous max is a_i or a_{i-1}.

When transitioning from i to i+1:

   if the previous max is a_i (flag is True), then the next_val must be >= a_i. This ensures that a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, next_val) = max(a_i, next_val) (since a_i is the previous max, which is >= a_{i-1}).

   So a_i <= max(a_i, next_val) = next_val (since next_val >= a_i).

   So a_i <= next_val.

   But the condition for a_i is a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}).

   But since a_i is the previous max, which is >= a_{i-1}, max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}) = max(a_i, a_{i+1}).

   So the code ensures that a_i <= next_val, which is required for a_i's condition.

   So this part is correct.

When the previous max is not a_i (flag is False), then a_i <= a_{i-1}.

   The next_val can be any value. But the a_i's condition is a_i <= max(a_{i-1}, next_val).

   Since a_i <= a_{i-1}, max(a_{i-1}, next_val) >= a_{i-1} >= a_i. So the condition is automatically satisfied.

   So the code's model allows any next_val when the flag is False.

So the code's model correctly ensures that a_i's condition is satisfied.

But in the sample input 1:

   The middle element a_2 must be <= max(a_1, a_3) = max(1, 2) =2.

   So a_2 <= 2.

   Additionally, the code's model allows a_2 to be >= a_1 (1) and ensures that a_3 (2) <= a_2.

   So during the last step, a_3 is 2, which must be <= a_2. So a_2 >=2.

   So a_2 must be >=2 and <=2 → a_2=2.

   So the code's model during the transition to i=3 (last element) ensures that a_3 <= a_2.

   But a_2's condition (a_2 <= max(a_1, a_3)) is ensured by the code's model.

   Because during the transition to i=3, the code allows a_3=2 <= a_2.

   So a_2 >=2.

   But in the code's model, during the transition from i=2 to i=3 (last element), the code ensures that a_3 (2) <= a_2.

   So a_2 >=2.

   So during the last step, the code sums all a_2 >=2.

   However, in the first transition (i=1 to i=2), the code allows a_2 >=1.

   So the code's model for a_2 allows a_2 >=
