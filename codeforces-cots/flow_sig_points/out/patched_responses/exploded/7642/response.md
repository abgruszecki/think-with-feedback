Okay, let's see. We have this problem where we need to arrange chests (regular or mimics) in a circle of rooms. The player starts in a random room, collects treasure until they hit a mimic, and we need to compute the minimal expected value for each k (number of mimics) from 1 to n. Then output those values modulo 998244353.

Hmm. So, for each k, we need to choose which chests are mimics (exactly k of them) and arrange the rest such that the expected value is minimized. The key is figuring out the optimal arrangement of the chests and mimics to minimize this expectation.

First, let's think about the structure. Since the rooms are arranged in a circle, the placement of the mimics will determine how many chests are collected before each mimic. For each chest, the player collects it only if all the previous rooms (in the circular order) before the first mimic are regular. Wait, no. Let's model the scenario.

When the player starts at a certain room, they proceed through each subsequent room until they hit a mimic. So the path is a contiguous sequence of regular chests followed by a mimic. The starting room must be part of this sequence. So, for example, if the rooms are ordered as R R M R (where M is mimic), then the player could start at the first R, collect all three Rs before the M. Or start at the M, collect nothing. Or start at the third R, collect it, then the next M stops them. Wait, but the order is a circle, so the sequence after the M would loop back. Hmm, perhaps the arrangement of mimics divides the circle into segments. Each segment is a consecutive set of regular chests followed by a mimic. Then, the starting room determines which segment's regular chests the player collects.

Wait, no. Because if you start in a regular chest that's part of a segment between two mimics, the player collects all the regular chests from the starting point up to (but not including) the next mimic. So the arrangement of mimics breaks the circle into runs of regular chests. Each run is followed by a mimic. So, the structure is that all the mimics are placed in such a way that between any two consecutive mimics (in the circular order), there's a block of regular chests. The starting room determines which block the player is in. Then, the player collects all the chests in that block up to the first mimic.

Wait, no. Because if you have a sequence like R R M R M, then the two mimics are separated by a regular. So the blocks would be between the mimics. So, for example, the M at position 3 is followed by R at position 4, then M at 5. So the blocks would be the R R before the first M, then the R between the two Ms, and then after the second M, it wraps around to the beginning. Wait, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to have all the mimics placed consecutively? Or perhaps to arrange the mimics in a way that each block of regular chests is as small as possible.

But the goal is to minimize the expected value. So for a given k mimics, we need to arrange the regular chests and mimics such that the sum of (sum of chests in each block) multiplied by the probability of starting in that block is minimized.

So the problem reduces to:

Arrange the k mimics and (n - k) regular chests in a circle. The arrangement must have exactly k mimics, and the rest regular. For each block of regular chests between two consecutive mimics (in the circular order), the sum of the chests in that block multiplied by the length of the block (since the starting room can be any in the block, and each contributes to the sum for their entire block) is part of the total expectation.

Wait, let's think again about the expectation. For a given arrangement of mimics and regular chests, the circle is divided into segments (blocks) of regular chests, each followed by a mimic. So, each block is a consecutive set of regular chests, followed by a mimic. The player starts in a room. If the room is in a block, they collect all the chests in that block from their starting position up to but not including the next mimic. Wait, no. Because the player proceeds room by room. So if the player starts in a room in a block, they collect that chest, then the next, and so on, until they hit a mimic. So the entire block is collected if the starting room is in that block. For example, if a block has m regular chests, then any starting position in that block will collect all m chests. Wait, no. Wait, no. Suppose the block is of length m. Let's say the player starts at position 1 (in the block). Then they collect that chest, then go to the next (position 2), collect it, etc., until they reach the mimic. So the number of chests collected depends on the starting position. For example, if the block is [R1, R2, R3, M], then starting at R1 gives 3 chests. Starting at R2 gives 2. Starting at R3 gives 1. So the sum for this block is (3 + 2 + 1) * 1/n. Wait, but the total is the sum over all starting positions of the sum of chests collected. Then divided by n, the number of rooms. So for each block of m regular chests, the sum contributed by that block is sum_{i=1 to m} (i) * (sum of c's in the first i chests of the block). Wait, no. Wait, if the block is m regular chests followed by a mimic, then the player will collect all chests from their starting position up to the end of the block. So if the block is [R1, R2, R3, M], then:

Start at R1: collect R1, R2, R3 → sum c1 + c2 + c3.

Start at R2: collect R2, R3 → sum c2 + c3.

Start at R3: collect R3 → sum c3.

So the total contribution of this block is (c1 + c2 + c3) + (c2 + c3) + c3 = c1 * 1 + c2 * 2 + c3 * 3.

So for a block of m regular chests, the contribution is sum_{i=1 to m} (c_i) * (m - i + 1). Because each chest c_i in the block is collected (m - i + 1) times (once for each starting position from the first to the i-th in the block). Wait, if the block is m chests, then the chest at position j (starting from 0 to m-1 maybe) will be collected (m - j) times. Because if the player starts at position 0 (first chest), they collect all m. If they start at position 1, they collect m-1, etc. So for the i-th chest in the block (assuming 0-based index), the number of times it's collected is (m - i). So sum for the block is sum_{i=0 to m-1} c_i * (m - i). 

Wait, yes. So for a block of m regular chests, the contribution to the total expectation is (sum_{i=0 to m-1} c_i * (m - i)) ) / n. Because each starting position has 1/n probability, and each contributes the sum of the chests from their starting position to the end of the block.

Therefore, the problem reduces to: arrange the regular chests into some number of blocks (exactly k blocks, since each block is followed by a mimic). The sum of all the block contributions (sum c_i * (m - i) for each block of size m) divided by n is the expectation. We need to minimize this sum.

So for each k, we need to select k positions to place mimics, which divides the circle into k blocks. Wait, but when arranged in a circle, k mimics will create k blocks (since after the last mimic, it wraps around to the first). So each block is a sequence of regular chests followed by a mimic. So the number of blocks is exactly k.

Wait, yes. So the arrangement must have exactly k mimics, and the regular chests are split into k blocks, each block followed by a mimic.

But the arrangement is circular, so the blocks are arranged in a circle. So the total number of regular chests is n - k (since there are k mimics). So the sum of the sizes of all blocks is (n -k).

Our goal is to arrange the regular chests into k blocks (with sum of their sizes being n -k) such that the sum over all blocks of (sum c_i * (m - i) for each chest in the block) is minimized.

So, the problem is to split the array of regular chests (which are some subset of the given chests) into k blocks, each block contributing a certain value, and minimize the sum of these values.

Wait, but the problem allows us to arrange the chests in any order, not just a subset. Oh right, the problem allows us to choose the order of the chests. So for a given k, we can choose which k chests are mimics (so their c_i are not part of any block), and arrange the remaining (n -k) regular chests in the rooms. But the arrangement of regular chests must be split into k blocks (each followed by a mimic) in the circular order.

Wait, no. The k mimics are placed in the rooms, and the regular chests are arranged in the remaining positions, but in such a way that the mimics are positioned to split the regular chests into exactly k blocks. So each block is a consecutive sequence of regular chests, followed by a mimic. Since it's a circle, the k blocks are formed by the k mimics.

So for example, if the mimics are placed at positions m1, m2, ..., mk, then the regular chests are arranged in the remaining positions, and between each pair of consecutive mimics (in the circular order) there's a block of regular chests. The sum of the contributions from each block is the sum of c_i multiplied by their position in the block (as discussed earlier).

But since the order of regular chests can be chosen, we can arrange the regular chests in each block in any order. However, to minimize the sum, we need to arrange each block's chests in a way that minimizes their contribution.

Wait, for a given block of m regular chests, what arrangement of the m chests minimizes the sum of c_i * (m - i) for i from 0 to m-1 (assuming 0-based index)? Let's see. The term (m - i) is largest when i is small. So, to minimize the sum, we should place the smaller c_i's where the (m - i) is largest. For example, in a block of size 3, the first position (i=0) contributes 3 * c_i, the second (i=1) contributes 2 * c_i, and the third (i=2) contributes 1 * c_i. So to minimize the sum, the smallest c_i should be placed first (so multiplied by 3), next smallest in the second position (multiplied by 2), etc. So arrange the chests in ascending order. That way, the largest multipliers are applied to the smallest values.

Yes, so for each block, to minimize the contribution, we sort the c_i's in ascending order and place them in the block such that the first position (with the largest multiplier) has the smallest c_i, etc.

So the minimal sum for a block of size m is sum_{j=0 to m-1} (m - j) * sorted_c[j], where sorted_c is the sorted list of c_i's in ascending order.

Therefore, the problem can be transformed into:

For each k (from 1 to n), select exactly k chests to be mimics (so that the remaining n-k are regular). Then, arrange the regular chests into k blocks of any sizes (summing to n -k), with each block's contribution being the sum of (m - j) * sorted_c_block_j[j], where m is the size of the block. The goal is to minimize the total sum.

But selecting which chests are mimics is part of the problem. Wait, but no. Because the problem requires that exactly k of the chests are mimics. So the selection of which chests are mimics will affect the sum. For example, if we choose the k largest c_i's as mimics, then the regular chests are the smaller ones, leading to a lower sum. So the optimal approach is to select the k largest c_i's as mimics, and arrange the remaining (n-k) c_i's into k blocks, each sorted in ascending order, and then split into blocks in a way that the sum of their contributions is minimized.

Wait, but why would we split into blocks? How does splitting into blocks affect the sum? Let's think: the total contribution is the sum over all blocks. Each block's contribution is the sum of (m - j) * c_i (sorted in ascending order), where m is the block size. For example, if we have two blocks of sizes m1 and m2, their contributions are sum_{j=0}^{m1-1} (m1 - j) * c_j (sorted) and sum_{j=0}^{m2-1} (m2 - j) * c_j (sorted). But how does splitting into blocks affect the total sum?

Wait, the sorted regular chests are split into k groups. Each group is sorted in ascending order, and the group is arranged such that their contributions are the sum of (m_i - j) * c_j for each element in the group. The key is that splitting into multiple groups allows us to have different multipliers (m_i - j) for different elements.

But how do we split the sorted regular chests into k groups to minimize the sum? Let's assume that the regular chests are sorted in ascending order. Then, splitting them into k groups (possibly of varying sizes) such that each group's contribution is minimized.

Wait, but each group's contribution is sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (m - j) * c_j. For a group of size m, the multipliers are m, m-1, ..., 1. So for the sorted regular chests (ascending order), the group's contribution is sum_{i=0 to m-1} (m - i) * c_i. If the group is split into smaller groups, for example, splitting a group of size 4 into two groups of 2 and 2, then the total contribution would be (2c0 + c1) + (2c2 + c3) compared to the original 4c0 +3c1 +2c2 +c3. Which is better?

Wait, let's take an example: c0=1, c1=2, c2=3, c3=4.

Original group of 4: 4*1 + 3*2 + 2*3 + 1*4 =4 +6 +6 +4=20.

Split into two groups of 2 each:

First group (1,2): 2*1 +1*2=2+2=4.

Second group (3,4): 2*3 +1*4=6+4=10. Total is 14 < 20. So splitting into smaller groups reduces the sum.

Ah, right. Because the multipliers are higher for smaller groups. For example, the first element in a group of size 2 contributes 2, which is higher than if it were in a group of size 4 (where it contributes 4). Wait, no. Wait, in a group of size 4, the first element contributes 4, which is larger than 2. But in the example, when the group was split, the sum decreased.

Wait, in the example, the original group's sum was 20, and splitting into two groups gave 4+10=14. So the sum decreased. So why?

Because the higher multipliers are applied to smaller values.

Ah, right. When we split a group into smaller groups, the higher multipliers (for the first elements of each group) are applied to the smaller elements. For example, in the split scenario, the first group's 1 and 2 have multipliers 2 and 1. But in the original group, they had multipliers 4 and 3. But since 1 is smaller than 3 and 4, maybe the trade-off is better.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way to split the sorted regular chests into k blocks is to have as many small groups as possible, so that the higher multipliers (group size) are applied to the smallest elements.

So, the problem reduces to:

Once the regular chests (sorted in ascending order) are split into k groups, the minimal sum is achieved by splitting the sorted list into groups such that the largest possible group sizes are assigned to the earliest elements. Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Let's think:

We have the sorted list of regular chests in ascending order. We need to split them into k groups. For each group, the contribution is the sum of (group size - j) * c_i for each position j in the group (0-based).

To minimize the sum, the groups should be formed such that the largest multipliers (group size) are applied to the smallest c_i's. So the first elements (smallest c_i's) should be in the largest possible groups. Because a larger group size gives a higher multiplier for the first elements of the group.

Wait, for example, if we have a group of size m, the first element contributes m * c_i. So to minimize the sum, since c_i is sorted in ascending order, we want the largest m to multiply the smallest c_i. So for the first elements in the sorted list, we should have as large a group as possible. Then, the next elements can be in smaller groups, but perhaps the same logic applies.

But how do we split the sorted list into k groups to minimize the sum of their contributions?

This seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's model the problem as follows:

We have a sorted list of c_i's (sorted ascending). We need to split them into exactly k contiguous groups. Each group's contribution is the sum of (group size - j) * c_j (for j in 0 to group_size -1). Our goal is to find the minimal total sum.

But with n up to 3e5, a dynamic programming approach with O(nk) time is not feasible.

Hmm. So we need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me think about the contribution function. Suppose the sorted list is c_0 <= c_1 <= ... <= c_{m-1}, where m = n -k. We need to split them into k groups. Each group's contribution is sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (s - i) * c_{start + i}, where s is the size of the group.

But how can this sum be computed efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a prefix sum with certain coefficients. Let's see.

Suppose the sorted list is c_0, c_1, ..., c_{m-1}.

For each possible split into k groups, the total sum is the sum over each group of (s * sum(c_i) + (s-1) * sum(c_i) + ... + 1 * sum(c_i)) for the group. Wait, no. For a group of size s, the contribution is sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (s - i) * c_i'. Where c_i' is the i-th element in the group. But since the group is contiguous in the sorted list, the elements in the group are consecutive elements from the sorted list.

Wait, perhaps if we split into groups such that each group is a consecutive segment of the sorted list, then the problem is to split the sorted list into k contiguous segments, each of which contributes a certain value, and we need to minimize the sum of these values.

Wait, but that's assuming that each group must be a contiguous segment of the sorted list. Is that the case? Because the arrangement in the circle is such that each block is followed by a mimic. But the order of the blocks in the circle can be arranged in any way. However, since the circle's arrangement is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange the groups in any order. But in terms of the sum, the order of the groups in the circle doesn't matter. Because each group's contribution is determined by its own size and the elements in it. So the sum is the same regardless of the order of the groups. Therefore, the problem reduces to splitting the sorted list of regular chests (ascending order) into exactly k contiguous groups, and compute the sum of each group's contribution.

But wait, why contiguous groups? Because the sorted list is in order, and the groups are formed by splitting into contiguous segments. Because if we can arrange the groups in any order, but the sorted list is fixed, then the optimal way would be to split into contiguous groups, as any permutation would lead to higher sums. For example, if a group contains elements that are not contiguous in the sorted list, like group1: c_0 and c_2, and group2: c_1 and c_3, but since the sorted list is c0 <= c1 <= c2 <= c3, then group1's contribution would be (2 * c0 + 1 * c2) and group2's (2 * c1 + 1 * c3), which might be higher than if they were contiguous. So perhaps splitting into contiguous groups is optimal.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose the sorted list is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Split into two groups: [1,3] and [2,4]. The sum would be for the first group (2*1 + 1*3) =5, and the second group (2*2 +1*4) =8. Total 13. If we split into contiguous [1,2] and [3,4], the sum is (2*1 +1*2) + (2*3 +1*4) =4 +10=14, which is larger. So the non-contiguous split gives a better sum. But this contradicts the earlier assumption. So why?

In this example, the non-contiguous split allows us to have higher multipliers (the 2) applied to the smaller elements (1 and 2), but in the example, the sum is better. Wait, in this case, the non-contiguous groups have higher sum. Wait no: [1,3] and [2,4] sum to 5 +8=13. [1,2] and [3,4] sum to 4+10=14, which is worse. So the non-contiguous split is better. But how is that possible?

But in the problem statement, the order of the regular chests can be chosen. So perhaps the sorted list is not the way to arrange the regular chests. Wait, no. Wait, the regular chests can be arranged in any order. But to minimize the sum, we would arrange them in ascending order. Then split into groups. But perhaps when the regular chests are arranged in ascending order, the optimal split into groups is contiguous. But the example shows that a non-contiguous split could give a better sum, which suggests that maybe the assumption of contiguous groups is incorrect. However, this leads to a problem because the regular chests are arranged in a circle. So the order of the groups is arbitrary, but each group must be contiguous in the circular arrangement. However, the order in which the groups are placed in the circle doesn't affect the sum, since each group's contribution depends only on its own elements and size.

Wait, but in the example, if the regular chests are arranged in the order [1,3,2,4], then split into [1,3] and [2,4], but arranged in the circle. But the problem is that the order of the regular chests can be any permutation. So perhaps the initial approach of arranging the regular chests in ascending order and then splitting into contiguous groups is not the optimal way. Because we could arrange the regular chests in any order, and then split into groups. So how to model this.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the problem is not just about splitting the sorted list into groups but also permuting the regular chests to find the best arrangement.

But this seems computationally impossible for large n. So perhaps there's a way to structure the problem such that the optimal arrangement is to arrange the regular chests in ascending order and split them into contiguous groups. But how to prove that.

Alternatively, perhaps arranging the regular chests in ascending order and then splitting them into contiguous groups in a way that each group is assigned the largest possible size (so that the largest multipliers are applied to the smallest elements) is optimal.

Let me think: For a sorted list, the minimal sum is achieved by grouping the smallest elements into the largest possible groups. So for example, when splitting into k groups, the first group (smallest elements) is as large as possible, then the next group is as large as possible, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to split the sorted list into k groups is to make the group sizes as equal as possible. For example, if m =n-k is the number of regular chests, then the groups would be of size either floor(m/k) or ceil(m/k). But how does that affect the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by splitting the sorted list into groups in such a way that the largest possible group sizes are assigned to the earliest elements. For example, the first group would be of size ceil(m/k), the next groups of size floor(m/k), etc. But again, this is just a hypothesis.

But given that the problem has to handle n up to 3e5 and k up to n, we need an O(n log n) approach.

Another angle: when the regular chests are sorted in ascending order, the minimal sum for splitting into k groups is achieved by choosing the positions where to split in a way that the sum is minimized. This is similar to the problem of splitting an array into k segments to minimize the sum of some cost function. For example, in some dynamic programming problems.

But for this to be feasible, the cost function must have certain properties, like being convex or having certain optimal substructure. Let's see.

Suppose the cost of a group from i to j is the sum (j - i + 1) * c_i + (j -i) * c_{i+1} + ... + 1 * c_j. How can this be computed efficiently? Let's denote the group as starting at position a (0-based) and ending at position b (inclusive), with size s = b -a +1.

Then the cost for this group is sum_{i=a}^b (s - (i -a)) * c_i. Wait, for each element in the group, the multiplier is s - (position in group). So for the first element in the group (a), the multiplier is s. For the second (a+1), s-1, etc.

If the array is sorted in ascending order, then for any split into groups, the cost can be computed as the sum of each group's cost. We need to split into exactly k groups to minimize the total cost.

This seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming, but for n up to 3e5 and k up to n, a standard DP approach would be O(nk), which is not feasible.

So we need a different approach. Let's think about the problem in terms of the minimal sum for a given k.

Let’s first sort the regular chests in ascending order. The sum for a group of size s is sum_{i=1 to s} i * c_{sum_{j=1 to i-1} s_j + i}. Wait, perhaps it's better to precompute prefix sums and then model the cost.

Another idea: the cost of a group of size s is sum_{i=1 to s} i * c_i (assuming the group contains the first s elements). Wait no. For a group consisting of elements c_1, c_2, ..., c_s (sorted), the cost is sum_{i=1 to s} (s - (i-1)) * c_i. Which is sum_{i=1 to s} (s -i +1) * c_i. For example, s=3: 3c1 + 2c2 + c3.

So if we precompute for each possible group size s, the minimal possible cost is to take the first s elements (sorted) and compute 3c1 + 2c2 + c3 (for s=3). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the regular chests are sorted in ascending order, the optimal way to split them into k groups is to arrange each group as a contiguous segment, and the splits are between elements. For example, for k=2, split after the first element, second element, etc. But how to choose the splits to minimize the sum.

Wait, the problem is similar to the classic problem of splitting a sequence into k segments to minimize the sum of some cost function. For example, when the cost function is additive over segments, and the optimal split can be found using dynamic programming. However, for large n and k, we need a more efficient approach.

An alternative approach is to model the cost function and see if it is convex, allowing the use of a greedy algorithm or convex hull optimization.

But let's think about the cost for a group of size s. The cost is sum_{i=1 to s} (s - i +1) * c_i. Let's denote this as f(s). For a sorted array, this function has certain properties. For example, if the array is sorted in ascending order, then splitting into more groups reduces the sum. Because each split allows higher multipliers (s) to be applied to smaller elements.

Wait, the total sum for splitting into k groups is sum_{i=1}^k f(s_i), where sum s_i = m =n-k.

If we can split into more groups, then the sum decreases. For example, splitting a group of size 4 into two groups of 2 each reduces the sum. So for a given k, the minimal sum is achieved by splitting into exactly k groups, which may have varying sizes.

But how to find the minimal sum for a given k.

Another idea: For the sorted array, the minimal sum when split into k groups is the sum of the first (m -k +1) elements multiplied by 1, plus the next elements multiplied by 1, etc. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when the sorted array is split into k groups, each of size at least 1. The optimal way is to have the first k-1 groups of size 1, and the last group of size m - (k-1). Because for the first k-1 groups of size 1, their contribution is 1 * c_i. The last group's contribution is sum_{i= k-1}^{m-1} (m - (k-1) - (i - (k-1)) +1) * c_i. Wait, this may not be optimal.

Wait, for example, if m=4, k=3. Then the optimal split is groups of size 1, 1, 2. The sum is 1*c1 +1*c2 + (2*c3 +1*c4). Which may be better than other splits. But this depends on the values of c_i.

But this seems to suggest that the optimal way to split into k groups is to have the first (k-1) groups of size 1, and the last group of size (m - (k-1)). But why?

Because when a group is split into two groups, the sum decreases. For example, a group of size s splits into two groups of size a and b (a +b = s). The original sum is sum_{i=1}^s (s -i +1) * c_i. After split, the sum is sum_{i=1}^a (a -i +1) * c_i + sum_{i=a+1}^s (b - (i -a) +1) * c_i. Which is sum_{i=1}^a (a -i +1) * c_i + sum_{j=1}^b (b -j +1)*c_{a+j}.

Since the array is sorted in ascending order, the sum of the two groups will be less than the original sum. For example, the first group's contribution is a*c1 + (a-1)*c2 + ... +1*c_a. The second group's contribution is b*c_{a+1} + ... +1*c_{a +b}. Since c_{a+1} >= c_i for i <=a, the sum would be larger. Wait, but the original group's contribution includes terms like (a +b) * c1, which is larger than a *c1 in the split. So overall, splitting a group into two groups reduces the sum.

Wait, no. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose the group is [1,2,3], size 3. The contribution is 3*1 +2*2 +1*3 =3+4+3=10. If split into two groups [1] and [2,3], then their contributions are 1*1 + (2*2 +1*3)=1 +7=8, which is less than 10. So splitting reduces the sum.

But what if the group is [1,1,1]. Then the original sum is 3+2+1=6. Split into two groups [1,1] and [1], the sum is (2*1 +1*1) +1*1 =3+1=4, which is better.

So for any group of size s >=2, splitting it into smaller groups reduces the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is achieved when we split the sorted array into as many groups as possible (k groups, each of size 1 except possibly one). Wait, but the problem requires exactly k groups. So for a given k, the minimal sum is achieved by having the first (k-1) groups of size 1, and the last group of size m - (k-1). Because each split reduces the sum.

But why?

Because each group of size 1 contributes 1 * c_i. Groups of larger sizes contribute higher terms. So, by splitting into as many groups as possible (k groups), and each group being as small as possible (size 1), the sum is minimized.

Wait, but groups of size 1 contribute c_i multiplied by 1. Larger groups contribute higher terms. So the more groups we have (up to k), the better. For example, if we have m elements and k groups, the minimal sum is achieved when we have (k) groups of size 1, but that's possible only if m >=k. But m is n -k. So when k <=n -k → 2k <=n → which is possible for certain k's.

Wait, no. m =n -k. For example, if n=5 and k=3, m=2. So we need to split into k=3 groups, but m=2. So that's impossible. Because each group must have at least one element. So the minimal number of groups is 1. Therefore, the problem requires that the number of groups is exactly k. So for each k, the number of groups is k. So m must be >=k, since each group has at least one element. So m =n -k >=k → n >= 2k. So for k > (n)/2, it's not possible. Wait, but this would violate the problem's constraints. The problem allows k up to n. But for example, if k is n, then m =0. So all chests are mimics. The expected value is zero. Which matches the sample input where for k=2 (n=2), the output is zero.

Wait, but when k =n, then all chests are mimics, so the player always starts on a mimic and collects nothing. So the expectation is zero.

But for the general case, when k is between 1 and n. Let's think of m =n -k. To split into exactly k groups, each group must have at least 1 element. So m >=k → n -k >=k → n >=2k → k <=n/2. But if k exceeds n/2, then m =n -k <k. So it's impossible to split into k groups. So what happens in that case?

Wait, no. Because the problem states that exactly k chests are mimics. So, for k mimics, the number of regular chests is m =n -k. Then, the number of groups in the circular arrangement must be exactly k. Because each mimic must be followed by a group of regular chests. Wait, no. For example, if there are k mimics, then each mimic must be followed by a group of regular chests. But since it's a circle, the arrangement must consist of exactly k groups of regular chests, each followed by a mimic. So the number of groups is exactly k, and each group must have at least zero elements. Wait, no. If a group has zero elements, then there are two consecutive mimics. But that's allowed. For example, a group of zero elements between two mimics would mean that after the first mimic, there's another mimic. So the player starting in that position would collect zero chests.

Wait, but the problem requires that exactly k of the chests are mimics. So in the case where m =n -k <k, we need to split the m regular chests into k groups. Each group can have zero or more chests. Because the groups are separated by mimics, but the mimics are placed in the circle. So for example, if there are k mimics, then between each pair of consecutive mimics, there is a group of regular chests. But if a group is of size zero, that means that two mimics are adjacent.

But then, the problem allows groups to have size zero. So the sum of the group sizes is m =n -k, which can be less than k. Because the sum is the total number of regular chests. So for k mimics, there are k groups, each of size >=0. Sum of sizes is m =n -k.

So in this case, when m <k, some groups have size zero. But how does that affect the contribution?

A group of size zero contributes nothing to the sum. So, for a group of size zero, the contribution is zero.

So, in this case, when m <k, the minimal sum is achieved by taking the m smallest c_i's (since we want to select the regular chests to be the smallest possible), and split them into groups. Since there are k groups, but m <k, some groups will have zero size. So the m regular chests are split into groups of size 1, and the remaining k -m groups have size zero. The sum is the sum of the m regular chests multiplied by 1 (since each group of size 1 contributes 1 * c_i). The remaining groups contribute nothing.

So for k > m, the minimal sum is sum of the m smallest c_i's multiplied by 1. Because each regular chest is in its own group (size 1), and the remaining groups are size zero. So the sum is sum of the m smallest c_i's.

So putting it all together:

For each k:

1. We select the k largest c_i's to be mimics. Because we want the regular chests to be the smallest possible, which minimizes their contribution.

2. The regular chests are the m =n -k smallest c_i's. These are sorted in ascending order.

3. We need to split these m regular chests into exactly k groups, which can have size zero. The minimal sum is achieved by creating as many groups of size 1 as possible (m groups), and the remaining k -m groups have size zero. But since we need exactly k groups, and m can be less than k.

Wait, no. For example, when m=2 and k=3, the regular chests are two elements. We need to split into 3 groups. So one possible split is two groups of size 1 and one group of size zero. The sum is 1*c0 +1*c1 +0 = sum of the two regular chests.

So, for k >=m:

The sum is sum of the m regular chests (each in a group of size 1, so contributing 1*c_i) and (k -m) groups of size zero (no contribution). The total sum is sum(c_i for i in regular chests).

For k <=m:

We need to split the m regular chests into k groups, each of size >=0. The sum is minimized by making as many groups of size 1 as possible, but since m >=k, we can have each group of size at least 1. Wait, no. Because when m >=k, each group must have at least 1 element. Because sum of group sizes is m, and there are k groups.

So for k <=m:

We need to split m into k groups, each of size >=1. The minimal sum is achieved by grouping the sorted regular chests into k groups such that the sum of (group size) * (sum of c_i's) with certain coefficients is minimized.

But how?

For k <=m, the regular chests are sorted in ascending order. We need to split them into k groups, each of size at least 1. The minimal sum is achieved by splitting them into k groups where the first k-1 groups are of size 1, and the last group is of size m - (k-1). Because this way, the largest multipliers (group size) are applied to the smallest elements.

For example, consider m=5, k=3. Split into groups of sizes 1,1,3. The sum is 1*c0 +1*c1 + (3*c2 + 2*c3 +1*c4). This would be better than splitting into 2,2,1 groups where the sum is (2c0 +1c1) + (2c2 +1c3) +1c4 = 2c0 + c1 + 2c2 +c3 +c4. Since the first split applies higher multipliers to the smaller elements, which is better for minimizing the sum.

Wait, but the first split applies 3*c2, which is higher than 2*c2. But since c2 is larger than c0 and c1, this would increase the sum, which is not desired. So perhaps this approach is not optimal.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think differently.

Since the regular chests are sorted in ascending order, the optimal way to split them into k groups is to have the first group contain as many elements as possible, then the next group, etc. Because the sum of (size - j) * c_i for each element in the group is minimized when larger multipliers are applied to smaller elements.

But if the group is larger, the first elements of the group have larger multipliers. So to minimize the sum, the first elements (smaller) should have larger multipliers, and the later elements (larger) should have smaller multipliers. Thus, grouping the elements into groups with sizes in non-increasing order.

But how to split into k groups with sizes s_1 >= s_2 >= ... >= s_k, and sum s_i =m.

This seems to be the case. For example, for m=4, k=2: groups of 3 and 1. The sum would be 3c0 +2c1 +c2 +1c3. If we split into 2 and 2: 2c0 +c1 +2c2 +c3. Comparing the two:

3c0 +2c1 +c2 +c3 vs 2c0 +c1 +2c2 +c3.

Which is better? It depends on the values. If c0 is small and c2 is larger, then the first option may have a smaller sum.

Thus, the optimal split is to have the groups in decreasing order of size. The largest group comes first, then the next largest, etc. This way, the largest multipliers are applied to the smallest elements.

So the strategy is:

For each k, we select the k largest c_i's as mimics. The remaining m =n -k c_i's are sorted in ascending order and split into k groups with sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, where s_i = floor(m/k) or ceil(m/k), and arranged in non-increasing order to apply larger multipliers to smaller elements.

But how to compute the sum efficiently?

Alternatively, for the sorted regular chests, the minimal sum when split into k groups is the sum of the first s_1 elements multiplied by their respective multipliers, plus the next s_2 elements multiplied by their multipliers, and so on.

But how to compute this sum for all possible k from 1 to n?

An alternative approach is to precompute for each position in the sorted regular chests array the contribution of each possible group size.

But this seems challenging.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the following steps:

For each k from 1 to n:

- Select the k largest c_i's as mimics.

- The remaining m =n -k c_i's are sorted in ascending order.

- If m ==0: the sum is 0.

- Else:

   If k > m: we have to split the m regular chests into k groups. Each group must have at least 0 elements. The minimal sum is achieved by creating m groups of size 1 (each contributing 1*c_i) and (k -m) groups of size 0. So the sum is sum of the regular chests.

   Else (k <=m): split the m chests into k groups of sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, where s_i >=1 and sum s_i =m. The sum is the sum for each group of sum_{i=0}^{s_j-1} (s_j -i) * c_{start + i}.

So for the case where k <=m, how to compute the sum.

Let's think of the sorted array as c_0, c_1, ..., c_{m-1} (ascending).

The optimal way to split into k groups is to have group sizes s_1 = floor((m) /k), s_2 = floor((m - s_1) / (k-1)), etc. But this may vary.

Alternatively, the optimal group sizes are when all groups are of size either s or s+1, where s = floor(m/k). This way, the first (m mod k) groups have size s+1, and the remaining have size s.

For example, m=5, k=2: groups of 3 and 2.

In this case, the sum would be (3c0 + 2c1 + c2) + (2c3 + c4).

Since the groups are ordered such that the larger groups come first, the larger multipliers are applied to the smaller elements.

So the minimal sum for k groups is the sum of the first (s+1) elements in groups of size s+1, and the remaining in groups of size s.

But how to compute this sum quickly.

Let's precompute the sorted regular chests in ascending order. Then, for each k, we can compute the sum as follows:

Compute how many groups of size s+1 and s:

s = m //k

r = m %k → number of groups of size s+1.

Each of the first r groups will be of size s+1, the remaining k -r groups of size s.

The sum is the sum for each group of the group's contribution.

For a group of size s, the contribution is sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (s -i) * c_{start +i}.

We can precompute prefix sums and prefix weighted sums to compute this.

For example, let's say the sorted array is c_0, c_1, ..., c_{m-1}.

For each group, starting at index a and of size s:

sum_{i=a}^{a+s-1} (s - (i -a)) * c_i = sum_{j=0}^{s-1} (s -j) * c_{a +j}.

This can be rewritten as sum_{j=0}^{s-1} (s -j) * c_{a+j} = sum_{t=1}^s t * c_{a + (s -t)}.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, we can precompute for the sorted array the prefix sums and the prefix sums multiplied by their indices.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to precompute for the sorted array:

prefix_sum[i] = sum_{j=0}^i c_j.

prefix_weighted_sum[i] = sum_{j=0}^i (j+1) * c_j.

But this might help in calculating the group contributions.

For a group of size s, starting at index a and ending at a+s-1.

The contribution is sum_{j=0}^{s-1} (s - j) * c[a +j].

Let's change variables: let j go from 0 to s-1. So for each j, the multiplier is s -j.

The sum is sum_{x=0 to s-1} (s -x) * c[a +x}.

But this is equal to sum_{x=0 to s-1} (x+1) * c[a + (s - x -1)].

Because if x = 0, then s -x = s, and the term is s * c[a +0]. If x= s-1, the term is 1 * c[a +s-1]. This is equivalent to summing from the end of the group backwards.

So for a group of size s, the contribution can be computed as sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (i+1) * c_{a +s -1 -i} }, which is sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (i+1) * c_{a + (s-1 -i)} }.

But this is the same as the sum of the first s elements of the reversed group multiplied by 1, 2, ..., s.

For example, the group [c0, c1, c2] (size 3) would have contribution 3c0 + 2c1 + c2. If reversed to [c2, c1, c0], the contribution is 1c2 + 2c1 +3c0, which is the same.

So, for a group of size s, the contribution can be viewed as the sum of (1, 2, ..., s) multiplied by the reversed group elements.

But since the group is a contiguous part of the sorted array (ascending), the reversed group is in descending order. So the sum is 1* c_{a+s-1} + 2* c_{a+s-2} + ... + s* c_a.

But how to compute this quickly using prefix sums.

Let me think. Suppose we have the sorted array in ascending order. For each group of size s starting at index a:

The contribution is sum_{i=0}^{s-1} (i+1) * c_{a + s-1 -i} } = sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} (s - (j -a)) * c[j].

Which is sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} (a + s - j) * c[j].

So for j in [a, a + s -1], the multiplier is (a + s -j).

We can precompute two arrays:

1. A prefix sum array: pre_sum[i] = c_0 + c_1 + ... + c_i.

2. A prefix weighted sum array: pre_wsum[i] = 1*c_0 + 2*c_1 + ... + (i+1)*c_i.

But these may not directly help.

Alternatively, for a group of size s starting at a, the contribution is sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} (s - (j - a)) * c_j.

This can be written as sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} (s - (j -a)) * c_j = sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} (s +a -j) * c_j.

Which can be rewritten as sum_{j= a}^{a+s-1} ( (a +s -j) ) * c_j.

Let’s make a substitution: k = j.

So sum_{k= a}^{a + s -1} (a + s -k) * c_k.

Which is sum_{k= a}^{a+s-1} (a +s -k) * c_k.

This can be split into:

sum_{k= a}^{a+s-1} (a +s) * c_k - sum_{k= a}^{a+s-1} k * c_k.

= (a +s) * (pre_sum[a+s-1] - pre_sum[a-1]) ) - (pre_ksum[a+s-1] - pre_ksum[a-1]).

Where pre_ksum is the prefix sum of k * c_k.

If we precompute pre_sum and pre_ksum, then the contribution can be computed in O(1) per group.

Yes! This is a crucial insight.

So, pre_sum[i] is the sum of c_0 to c_i.

pre_ksum[i] is the sum of 0*c_0 + 1*c_1 + ... + i*c_i. Wait, no. Wait, pre_ksum[i] is sum_{k=0 to i} k * c_k. Because for j=0, the index is 0.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

pre_sum[i] = sum_{j=0 to i} c_j.

pre_ksum[i] = sum_{j=0 to i} j * c_j.

Then, for a group from index a to b (inclusive), where the size is s = b -a +1.

The contribution is (a +s) * (pre_sum[b] - pre_sum[a-1]) ) - (pre_ksum[b] - pre_ksum[a-1]).

This is because:

sum_{k= a}^b (a + s -k) * c_k = sum (a + (b -a +1) -k) * c_k = sum ( (a +s) -k ) * c_k.

Which is equal to (a + s) * sum(c_k) - sum(k * c_k) for k from a to b.

Thus, using pre_sum and pre_ksum, we can compute the contribution of any group in O(1) time.

This is a key insight. This allows us to compute the contribution of any group in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

So, for the sorted regular chests, we precompute pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays. Then, for any group defined by a and b, the contribution is (a + s) * (pre_sum[b] - pre_sum[a-1]) - (pre_ksum[b] - pre_ksum[a-1]), where s = b -a +1.

Now, the problem reduces to:

For each k:

1. Select the k largest c_i's as mimics. The remaining m =n -k are sorted in ascending order.

2. Compute the minimal sum of contributions by splitting these m chests into exactly k groups. But for k > m, this is handled as sum of all regular chests.

But wait, when k > m, we have to split into k groups, but m chests. So we have (k -m) groups of size 0 and m groups of size 1. Each group of size 1 contributes 1 * c_i. So the sum is sum of all regular chests.

For k <=m, we need to split into k groups, each of size at least 1. The minimal sum is achieved by splitting into groups of sizes s+1 and s, as explained earlier.

So, for k <=m:

Compute s = m //k, r = m %k.

The first r groups are of size s+1, and the remaining (k -r) are of size s.

For example, m=5, k=2: s=5//2=2, r=5%2=1. So first group size 3, second group size 2.

Each group's contribution can be computed using the pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays.

The code steps would be:

For each k from 1 to n:

   if k ==n: output 0.

   else:

      m =n -k.

      if m ==0:

          output 0.

      else:

          if k >m:

              sum_val = sum of the first m chests in the sorted_regular array.

          else:

              s = m //k.

              r = m %k.

              sum_val =0.

              current_start =0.

              for i in 0 to r-1:

                  group_size = s+1.

                  a = current_start.

                  b = current_start + group_size -1.

                  contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

                  sum_val += contribution.

                  current_start += group_size.

              for i in r to k-1:

                  group_size =s.

                  a = current_start.

                  b = current_start + group_size -1.

                  contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

                  sum_val += contribution.

                  current_start += group_size.

          sum_val = sum_val / n.

          compute sum_val mod 998244353.

But how to handle the sorted regular chests for each k?

The key is that for each k, the regular chests are the m =n -k smallest elements of the original array.

So, we can sort the entire array in ascending order. Then, for each k, the regular chests are the first m elements (since we need the smallest m elements), and the mimics are the remaining k elements.

So, the sorted array is sorted in ascending order. For each k, the regular chests are the first m =n -k elements. The rest are mimics.

Thus, the steps are:

Sort the entire array in ascending order.

For each k in 1..n:

   m =n -k.

   if m ==0:

       output 0.

       continue.

   regular_chests = sorted_array[:m]

   if k >m:

       sum_val = sum(regular_chests)

   else:

       s = m //k

       r = m %k

       sum_val =0

       current_start =0

       for i in 0 to r-1:

           group_size = s+1

           a = current_start

           b = a + group_size -1

           contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

           sum_val += contribution

           current_start += group_size

       for i in r to k-1:

           group_size = s

           a = current_start

           b = a + group_size -1

           contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

           sum_val += contribution

           current_start += group_size

   sum_val = sum_val / n

   compute sum_val modulo 998244353.

But wait, the regular_chests are the first m elements of the sorted array. But when we process each k, the regular_chests are different. So for each k, we need to process a different subset of the sorted array. So we need to precompute the pre_sum and pre_ksum for the sorted array, but for each k, the regular_chests are the first m elements.

But how can we handle this?

Wait, no. Because for each k, the regular_chests are the first m elements of the sorted array. So the pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays are computed for the entire sorted array. Then, for each k, when m =n -k, the regular_chests are the first m elements. So the groups are formed from these m elements, and the pre_sum and pre_ksum for the regular_chests are the first m elements of the global pre_sum and pre_ksum.

Yes. So, once we sort the entire array in ascending order, the pre_sum and pre_ksum can be computed for the entire sorted array. Then, for each k, the regular_chests are the first m elements, and their pre_sum and pre_ksum are the same as the global pre_sum and pre_ksum up to index m-1.

So, the code can be structured as follows:

Sort the array in ascending order.

Compute pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays of length n.

For pre_sum[i] = sum of sorted_array[0..i]

pre_ksum[i] = sum of j * sorted_array[j] for j from 0 to i.

Then, for each k from 1 to n:

   m =n -k

   if m ==0:

       output 0.

       continue.

   if k >m:

       sum_val = pre_sum[m-1]

   else:

       s = m //k

       r = m %k

       sum_val =0

       current_start =0

       for i in 0 to r-1:

           group_size = s+1

           a = current_start

           b = a + group_size -1

           contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

           sum_val += contribution

           current_start += group_size

       for i in r to k-1:

           group_size = s

           a = current_start

           b = a + group_size -1

           contribution = (a + group_size) * (pre_sum[b] - (pre_sum[a-1] if a>0 else 0)) - (pre_ksum[b] - (pre_ksum[a-1] if a>0 else 0))

           sum_val += contribution

           current_start += group_size

   sum_val = sum_val // n ?

   No, the sum_val is divided by n, but since it's a fraction, we need to compute modular inverse.

Wait, sum_val is the numerator P, and the denominator is n. So the expectation is P/(n), and we need to output P * n^{-1} mod 998244353.

So for each k, the expected value is (sum_val) / n. So in code:

mod = 998244353

inv_n = pow(n, mod-2, mod)

result = (sum_val % mod) * inv_n % mod

But sum_val can be very large, so we need to compute it modulo mod.

But the problem is that sum_val can be computed as (sum_val mod mod) during the computation.

So the steps are:

For each k:

   compute sum_val as described.

   sum_val modulo mod.

   multiply by inv_n modulo mod.

So the code must compute sum_val using the pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays, which are computed modulo mod.

Wait, but the c_i can be up to 1e6, and multiplied by indexes up to 3e5. So the sum_val can be up to 1e6 *3e5 *3e5 = 9e16, which is larger than 1e18, which is the limit for 64-bit integers. So to prevent overflow, we need to compute everything modulo mod, but since we are dealing with fractions, we need to compute the numerator modulo mod and then multiply by the inverse of the denominator.

So the correct approach is:

- Precompute the pre_sum and pre_ksum arrays modulo mod.

- For each group contribution, compute the terms modulo mod.

This way, sum_val is stored modulo mod.

Thus, the code must compute all operations modulo 998244353.

But wait, since the sum_val is a sum of terms, each computed modulo mod, then the total sum_val is sum_val mod mod.

Yes. So, the code can proceed as follows:

Sort the array in ascending order.

Compute pre_sum and pre_ksum modulo mod.

pre_sum[0] = c[0] % mod.

pre_ksum[0] = 0 * c[0] % mod.

For i >=1:

pre_sum[i] = (pre_sum[i-1] + c[i]) % mod.

pre_ksum[i] = (pre_ksum[i-1] + i * c[i]) % mod.

But wait, sorted array is in ascending order. So c is sorted.

For each k from 1 to n:

   m =n -k

   if m ==0:

       print(0, end=' ')

Sample Input 2:

8

10 4 3 6 5 10 7 5

Sorted array is [3,4,5,5,6,7,10,10]

For k=1:

m=8-1=7.

k=1 <=7.

s=7//1=7, r=0.

So one group of size7.

a=0, b=6.

term1 = (0+7) * pre_sum[6].

pre_sum[6] is sum of first 7 elements:3+4+5+5+6+7+10=40.

0+7=7. 7*40=280.

term2=pre_ksum[6] =0*3 +1*4 +2*5 +3*5 +4*6 +5*7 +6*10 =0 +4 +10 +15 +24 +35 +60 = 148.

contribution=280-148=132.

sum_val=132.

132/8 =16.5 → 16.5 mod 998244353 = 132 * inv(8) mod mod.

inv(8) is 124780545.

132 * 124780545 mod mod is (132 * 124780545) mod mod. Let's compute:

124780545 × 132 = 124780545 * 100 = 12,478,054,500 → plus 32 ×124,780,545 =3,992, 97,440 → total is 16,470, 95, 940 → mod 998244353.

But in any case, the sample output for the first element is 132/8 → 16.5 → 499122193 (which is 132 * inv(8) mod mod).

The code seems to handle this.

Thus, the code should work.
