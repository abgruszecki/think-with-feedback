Okay, let's see. The problem is about replacing each occurrence of "ab" in the string with "bba" and counting the minimum steps required until there are no more "ab"s left. Each step, we can replace one "ab", but the choice of which one affects the total steps. Hmm, the key here is to figure out the order of replacements that gives the minimum steps. But wait, how does the order affect the total count? Because replacing an "ab" earlier might create new "ab"s that need to be processed. So maybe the order does matter. But the problem states to find the minimum number of steps. So perhaps there's a pattern here based on the positions of the a's and b's.

Let me think about the example given. The second input is "aab". The steps are:

Original: a a b
First, the "ab" starting at position 1 (assuming 0-based) is replaced. So after first step, it becomes a → replace the second a and the following b? Wait, "aab" has two a's followed by a b. So the possible "ab" substrings are the first a followed by the second a? No, because the second a is not a b. Wait, wait, the initial "aab" is 'a', 'a', 'b'. So the first two characters are 'aa'—no. The second and third are 'ab'—so that's the only occurrence. Wait, but the first example's note says that the first example "ab" becomes "bba" in one step. So in the second example, the input is "aab", which after replacing the "ab" (positions 1 and 2) gives "a" + "bba" → "abba". Then, in the next steps, we have to process the new "ab" that might appear. Let's see the steps.

Original: a a b → step 1: replace the "ab" (positions 1 and 2) with "bba", so the string becomes a + bba → abba. Now, the new string is 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. Now, the possible "ab" substrings are between the first 'a' and the first 'b', and between the third 'b' and the 'a'? Wait, no. The first 'a' is followed by 'b's. So the first 'a' in abba is at position 0, followed by 'b's at 1 and 2. Then the 'a' is at position 3. So in abba, the possible "ab" substrings are the 'a' at 0 and the 'b's after. So the first occurrence is 'ab' at positions 0 and 1. Replacing that gives 'bba' in place of 'ab', so the string becomes 'bbabba'? Wait, let's reconstruct step by step.

Step 1: Replace the 'ab' in the original aab (positions 1 and 2) with bba. So the new string is a (from first a) + bba → 'abba'. Now, in 'abba', the 'a's and 'b's are arranged as a, b, b, a. The 'a's are at positions 0 and 3. So the possible 'ab's are between position 0 and 1 (a followed by b). So replacing that 'ab' gives 'bba' in place. So the string becomes 'bba' followed by the rest. So the next step's string is 'bba' + 'ba' → 'bba' + 'ba' → but wait, the original was 'a' followed by 'bba', which is abba. So replacing the first 'ab' (positions 0 and 1) in 'abba' would replace the 'a' and 'b' with 'bba', leading to 'bba' followed by 'ba' → 'bbabba'? Or wait, maybe the string is abba (positions 0:a, 1:b, 2:b, 3:a). The first 'ab' is at positions 0-1. Replacing that would make the string start with 'bba' (positions 0-2) followed by the remaining 'b' (position 2) and 'a' (position 3)? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

Original after step 1: a → bba (the original aab becomes a followed by replacing ab with bba, so the string is a followed by bba, which is 'abba').

In 'abba', the a is at index 0, then two b's and an a. The next 'ab' is the a at 0 and b at 1. Replacing that gives 'bba' in their place, so the string becomes 'bba' followed by the remaining 'ba' (the third and fourth characters). So 'bba' + 'ba' is 'bbab a'? Wait, no. The original after step 1 is 'abba', which is a, b, b, a. Replacing the first two characters 'ab' with 'bba' gives 'bba' followed by the remaining 'ba' (positions 2 and 3: 'b' and 'a'). So the new string is 'bba' + 'ba' → 'bbabba'? Wait, the 'ba' after the replacement would be 'b' followed by 'a' → which is 'ba', which is another 'ab' in the next steps. Hmm, but how does this affect the count.

But according to the example, the steps required for 'aab' are 3. Let's see:

Step 1: replace the original 'ab' → step count 1. The string becomes 'abba'.

Step 2: replace the first 'ab' in 'abba' → step count 2. The string becomes 'bba' + 'ba' → 'bbaba'.

Step 3: replace the 'ab' in 'bbaba' (which is the third character 'a' and the fourth 'b'? Wait, no. Wait, 'bbaba' is characters: b, b, a, b, a. So the 'ab' is at position 2-3. Replacing that gives 'bba', so the string becomes 'bb' + 'bba' + 'a' → 'bbbbaa'. So that's step 3. Then, there are no more 'ab's. So total steps 3.

So the order of replacement matters. But how can we model this optimally?

The key is that each 'a' can generate a certain number of steps depending on the number of 'b's that come after it. Because each 'a' followed by some 'b's will create a chain of replacements. For example, consider a single 'a' followed by k 'b's. Let's see how many steps are needed.

Case 1: k=1 → 'ab' → one step, becomes 'bba' (now 'bba' has no 'ab's). So steps=1.

Case 2: k=2 → 'abb'. The initial 'ab' (a followed by first b) is replaced. Step 1: becomes 'bbab'. Now, the new string has 'ba' which is not 'ab', but the 'bbab' has 'bba' followed by 'b', so no 'ab's. Wait, wait: after replacing the first 'ab', the string becomes 'bba' followed by the remaining 'b' → 'bba' + 'b' → 'bbab'. Then, looking for 'ab's, there's the 'a' in 'bba' followed by 'b'? Wait, 'bba' is b, b, a. Then followed by 'b', so the third character is 'a' followed by the fourth 'b', which forms 'ab'. So replacing that gives 'bba' in place. So step 2. Then, the string is 'bb' + 'bba' → 'bbbb a', which is 'bbbb a' (no 'ab's). So total steps for 'abb' is 1 + 2 = 3 steps.

Wait, but wait. Let's see:

Original: 'abb' → 'ab' followed by 'b'. So first step replaces the first 'ab' → 'bba' + 'b' → 'bba b' → 'bbab'. Now, the 'a' is at position 2, followed by a 'b' at position 3. So there's another 'ab' here. Replacing that gives 'bba' in place, which is step 2. So the string becomes 'bb' (from first two b's) + 'bba' (from replacing the 'ab') → 'bbbb a', which is 'bbbba'? Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

After first replacement, 'abb' → 'bba' followed by 'b' → 'bba b' → 'bbab'. Now the string is 'b','b','a','b'.

The 'ab' is at positions 2 and 3. Replacing that gives 'bba' → so the string becomes 'bb' (positions 0-1) + 'bba' (from replacing positions 2-3) → 'bbbb a' → which is 'bbbb a' (assuming the 'a' is now at the end? Wait, the original 'bbab' is b, b, a, b. Replacing the 'a' and 'b' (positions 2 and 3) with 'bba' would result in inserting 'bba' in their place. So the new string is 'bb' (positions 0-1) + 'bba' (from replacement) → 'bbbb a' → but wait, the 'a' in 'bba' is part of the replacement. So the new string is 'bb' + 'bba' → 'bbba'? Or wait, no: the original 'bbab' is length 4. Replacing positions 2 and 3 (a and b) with 'bba' (3 characters) would make the new string of length 5. Let's see:

Original: positions 0: 'b', 1: 'b', 2: 'a', 3: 'b'.

Replacing positions 2-3 ('ab') with 'bba' gives a new string 'bb' (positions 0-1) followed by 'bba' (the replacement) → new string is 'bb' + 'bba' → 'bbbba' (length 5). Now, in this new string, we have 'bbbb a' → the 'a' is at the end. So no 'ab's. So steps 2. But according to the earlier example where 'aab' gives 3 steps, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps each 'a' contributes steps based on the number of 'b's after it. Let's see. For an 'a' followed by m 'b's, how many steps does it contribute?

Looking at the first example:

Each 'a' can generate a chain of transformations. For example, consider an 'a' followed by m 'b's. The first replacement of 'ab' (a followed by first b) creates 'bba', which is two b's followed by an a. But this a is now followed by (m-1) b's. So each replacement of an 'a' followed by a b increases the number of steps exponentially, perhaps.

Wait, let's model this. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have an 'a' followed by m 'b's. Let's call the number of steps required for this as f(m).

For m=1:

We replace once. So f(1) = 1.

For m=2:

Initially, 'ab' (m=1 part) → replaced once. Then the 'a' in 'bba' is followed by another 'b'. So now the structure is 'bb a b' (since after replacement, the original 'ab' becomes 'bba', and the next 'b' is after that). So the 'a' is now followed by one 'b'. So after the first step, we have to handle that 'ab' which takes f(1) steps. So total steps for m=2 is 1 + 2 * f(1) = 1 + 2*1 =3?

Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

Original 'abb' → a followed by two b's.

First step: replace the first 'ab' (a and first b) → 'bba' + 'b' → 'bba b' (which is 'bbab').

Now, the 'a' in 'bbab' is at position 2, followed by a 'b' at position 3. So replace that 'ab' → step 2. Now, the string becomes 'bb' + 'bba' → 'bbbba' (length 5). So total steps 2. But according to the earlier calculation, that's m=2 steps: 1 (original) + 1 (after first replacement) = 2 steps. But according to the example with 'aab' (which becomes 3 steps), perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, maybe the steps are additive in some way. Let's think again.

Another approach: For each 'a' in the original string, count how many 'b's are to the right of it. Then, each 'a' contributes 2^k -1, where k is the number of 'b's after it, but that's perhaps not accurate. Let's see.

For example, in the first sample input, there's one 'a' followed by one 'b'. The contribution is 1 = 2^1 -1 =1, which matches.

In the second example, the first 'a' is followed by two 'a's and then a 'b'. Wait, the input is 'aab' → two a's followed by a b. The first 'a' (position 0) has two 'a's after it and one 'b' → but the 'b's after are only one. Wait, but the 'a's between might affect the count. So perhaps the steps are determined by the number of 'a's that come before a certain 'a', and the 'b's after.

Alternatively, let's model the problem as follows:

Each 'a' that is followed by some 'b's will generate steps. The steps are computed based on the number of times the 'a' and 'b's are involved in replacements.

But how?

Another way to think: Each 'a' in the string can create a certain number of steps based on the 'b's that come after it. However, each time an 'a' is processed (i.e., replaced with 'bba'), it can generate new 'ab's that need to be processed. For example, replacing 'ab' with 'bba' introduces two 'b's and an 'a', which may create new 'ab's if there are more 'b's after.

Let's model this for each 'a' in the original string. Suppose we have an 'a' at position i, and there are m 'b's after it in the original string. What's the total steps contributed by this 'a'?

Let's see. For each 'a' followed by m 'b's, the steps required are (2^m -1) ? Let's check the examples.

First example: m=1 → 2^1 -1=1 → correct.

Second example: the input is 'aab', which is two a's followed by a b. The first 'a' (index 0) is followed by a 'a' and a 'b'. So the 'b's after it are only one (the third character). The second 'a' (index 1) is followed by one 'b'.

So for the first 'a', m=1 → 2^1-1=1. For the second 'a', m=1 → 1. So total steps would be 1 +1 =2. But the sample output is 3. So this approach is wrong.

Wait, but the sample output is 3. So that's not matching.

Hmm. So perhaps the formula is more complex. Let's think of the steps for each 'a' as follows.

Each 'a' that has m 'b's after it contributes (2^m -1) steps. But when there are multiple 'a's, the contributions are cumulative, but in a way that depends on the order of the 'a's.

Wait, for example, the second sample input 'aab' has two 'a's followed by a 'b'. The first 'a' is followed by 'a' and 'b'. The 'b's after the first 'a' is 1. The second 'a' is followed by one 'b'.

So according to the formula (2^m -1) for each 'a', the first 'a' would contribute 2^1 -1 =1, the second 'a' contributes 1. So total steps 2. But the sample's answer is 3. So that's not correct.

So maybe the formula needs to account for the fact that the 'a's are consecutive. Let's see.

Another approach: when processing the 'a's from right to left. Because each 'a' can affect the 'a's to the left of it.

For example, in the second sample, the 'aab' has two 'a's. Let's process the rightmost 'a' first. The right 'a' (position 1) is followed by one 'b'. So it contributes 1 step. Then, the left 'a' (position 0) is followed by the right 'a' and the 'b'. But the right 'a' has already been processed. How does that affect the left 'a'?

Alternatively, maybe the number of steps for each 'a' depends on the number of 'b's after it, but also the steps contributed by the 'a's to the right of it. 

Let me think again about the 'aab' case. The steps are 3. Let's see how each 'a' contributes.

The first 'a' (leftmost) is followed by another 'a' and a 'b'. So when the first 'a' is processed (i.e., when the 'ab' formed by this 'a' and the 'b' is replaced), but during the processing of this 'a', the 'a' may generate new 'ab's. Hmm.

Alternatively, think of the process for each 'a' in the order they appear. For each 'a', the number of steps is determined by the number of 'b's after it, but each 'a' to the right may have added more 'b's. Wait, but when an 'a' is processed, replacing 'ab' with 'bba' adds two 'b's and an 'a', which could create more 'ab's. So the order in which 'a's are processed affects how many steps are needed.

But the problem says to find the minimum steps. So the order of processing must be chosen in such a way that the steps are minimized. So perhaps the optimal approach is to process the 'a's from right to left, so that each 'a' is processed after all the 'a's to its right have been processed. Because when you process an 'a' to the right first, any new 'ab's generated by that processing would be to the right of the current 'a', and thus not affect the current 'a's contribution. This way, the steps for each 'a' can be computed independently.

So for example, in the 'aab' case:

Process the second 'a' (the rightmost) first. This 'a' is followed by one 'b'. Steps contributed: 1. Then process the first 'a' which is followed by the second 'a' (now processed and transformed into 'bba') and the 'b'. Wait, but after processing the second 'a', the 'ab' becomes 'bba', which adds two 'b's and an 'a'. So the first 'a' is now followed by two 'b's (from the second 'a's processing) and the original 'b'. So total 'b's after the first 'a' would be 3. So steps contributed by the first 'a' would be 2^3 -1 =7? But that's way more than the sample's 3 steps. So this approach isn't correct.

Hmm. Maybe I need to model the problem differently. Let's think of each 'a' in the original string. Each time an 'a' is followed by a 'b', replacing it creates two 'b's and an 'a'. The new 'a's could then form new 'ab's. So the process is similar to a chain reaction. The steps are cumulative based on how each replacement affects the sequence.

But how to model this efficiently, especially for large input strings (up to 1e6 characters).

Alternative idea: for each 'a' in the original string, compute the number of 'b's that come after it, considering the effect of previous 'a's. Let's call the total steps as a sum over all 'a's of (2^{k} -1) * 2^{p}, where k is the number of 'b's after the current 'a', and p is the number of 'a's that come after the current one. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the following:

For example, in the 'aab' case, the two 'a's are followed by a single 'b'. Let's process the first 'a' (leftmost) first. When we process this 'a', the 'ab' formed by this 'a' and the next 'a' is not possible. Wait, no. The first 'a' is followed by an 'a', not a 'b'. So initially, the first 'a' can't form any 'ab's. The second 'a' is followed by a 'b', so that's the only 'ab' in the initial string. Processing this 'ab' (step 1) turns it into 'bba', so the string becomes 'a' + 'bba' → 'abba'. Now, the first 'a' is followed by 'b's. So in this new string, the first 'a' is followed by two 'b's. Then, replacing that 'ab' (a followed by b) gives step 2, and the process continues.

But how does this relate to the original 'a's positions. It seems that the steps are determined by the 'a's in the order of their occurrence and the number of 'b's after them, but the processing of each 'a' can increase the number of 'b's for the 'a's to the left.

So for each 'a' in the original string, the number of 'b's that come after it in the original string plus the 'b's added by processing the 'a's to the right.

This suggests that the steps for each 'a' can be computed in a cumulative way, where each 'a' contributes (2^{current_power} -1) multiplied by 2^{prev_a_power} or something like that.

Alternatively, here's a mathematical approach:

Let’s process the string from right to left. For each 'a' encountered, the number of steps it contributes is based on the number of 'b's to its right (including those added by previous 'a's) multiplied by some factor. 

Let’s track two variables:

- count_b: the number of 'b's encountered so far (from the right)
- multiplier: the factor by which each new 'a's steps are multiplied due to previous 'a's processing.

For example, when an 'a' is processed (from the right), the steps it contributes are (2^current_b_count -1) multiplied by the multiplier. Then, since replacing this 'a's 'ab's will generate new 'b's, the count_b is updated. Also, the multiplier is updated for the next 'a's to the left.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

Initialize:

- count_b = 0 (number of original 'b's seen so far, moving from right to left)
- multiplier = 1 (initial multiplier)
- total_steps = 0

We process the string from right to left.

For each character in reverse order:

If the character is 'b', increment count_b by 1.

If the character is 'a', compute the steps contributed by this 'a'. 

Each 'a' contributes steps equal to (2^{count_b} - 1) * multiplier.

Then, since this 'a' will generate some 'b's when processed. Specifically, replacing an 'ab' with 'bba' adds one 'b' (since 'ab' becomes 'bba', which is two 'b's and an 'a'. So for each 'a', the number of 'b's that are added after processing is equal to the number of times this 'a' has contributed to steps, but how?

Alternatively, when an 'a' is processed (from the right), the steps contributed are (2^count_b -1) * multiplier. Then, each such 'a' adds count_b 'b's to the left. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think that each 'a' that is followed by k 'b's in the original string contributes (2^k - 1) steps. However, each 'a' to the left of this 'a' will have their k increased by the number of 'b's added by the current 'a's processing. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's look for a pattern or formula.

Looking at the first example:

Input: 'ab' → 'a' followed by one 'b'. Steps:1. Which is 2^1 -1 =1.

Second example: 'aab' → steps 3. Which is (2^1 -1) * 2 + (2^1 -1) = (1*2) +1=3.

Wait, the first 'a' (left) has one 'b' in the original string. But after the right 'a' is processed, it adds steps. Let's see:

The right 'a' has one 'b' after it. So steps for it: 1. Then the left 'a' has one 'b' (the original 'b') plus the 'b's generated by the right 'a's processing. How many 'b's are generated when the right 'a' is processed? The right 'a's processing contributes 1 step, which replaces 'ab' with 'bba'. This replaces the 'ab' into two 'b's and an 'a'. So the 'b's after the left 'a' increase by 1 (since each step for the right 'a' adds one 'b' for each 'b' in the original count). Wait, perhaps the number of 'b's after the left 'a' increases by the number of steps taken by the right 'a's processing multiplied by something.

Alternatively, the right 'a' contributes steps, which in turn increases the 'b's available for the left 'a's processing.

But how to model this.

Another idea: each time an 'a' is processed (from right to left), it contributes steps equal to (2^current_b -1) multiplied by some factor, and after processing, the current_b is updated to current_b + (steps contributed by this 'a') * (some factor). Not sure.

Alternatively, when processing an 'a', the steps it contributes is (2^current_b -1) multiplied by the multiplier. Then, since this 'a's processing introduces 2^current_b -1 steps, which creates new 'b's. But how?

Wait, perhaps when an 'a' is processed, each 'ab' in it's original position is replaced, which creates more 'b's. For each 'ab' replaced, the number of 'b's increases by 1 (since 'ab' → 'bba', which is two 'b's and an 'a', so replacing 'ab' adds one 'b').

But how does this affect the 'b's after the current 'a' when processing 'a's to the left.

Alternatively, let's model the number of 'b's that the current 'a' will contribute to the 'a's to the left of it.

When processing an 'a', the steps contributed by this 'a' is (2^count_b -1). But each step of this 'a' adds new 'b's. For each 'ab' that is replaced, one 'b' is added (since replacing 'ab' (2 characters) with 'bba' (3) adds one more 'b' and an 'a').

But the number of steps for this 'a' is equal to the number of 'ab's that are present in the sequence generated by this 'a' and the 'b's after it. Which is 2^count_b -1 steps. Each step for this 'a' adds one 'b' (since each replacement increases the number of 'b's by 1). So the total 'b's added by this 'a' is 2^count_b -1.

Thus, after processing this 'a', the 'count_b' for the 'a's to the left will be count_b + (2^count_b -1).

But how to compute this.

Wait, for example, suppose the current 'a' has count_b =1. Steps contributed: 2^1-1=1. 'b's added: 1. So new count_b =1 +1=2.

If another 'a' is processed next (to the left), with the new count_b=2. Steps contributed: 2^2-1=3. 'b's added:3. So new count_b=2+3=5.

So for each 'a', the steps are (2^count_b -1), and after processing, count_b becomes count_b + (2^count_b -1).

But this seems to model the 'count_b' as the total number of 'b's that would be generated by all the 'a's processed so far.

But how to accumulate this.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize count_b =0, result=0.

Process the string from right to left.

For each character:

- if it's 'b', increment count_b by 1.

- if it's 'a', then:

   steps = (2^count_b -1) % MOD

   result = (result + steps) % MOD

   count_b = (count_b + steps) % MOD

Wait, but why adding steps to count_b?

Because each step in processing this 'a' adds one 'b' (since each replacement of 'ab' increases the 'b's by one). But according to the formula steps = (2^count_b -1), which is the total steps for this 'a'. Each step adds one 'b', so the total added is steps. So the new count_b after this 'a' is processed is count_b + steps.

This seems to make sense.

Let's test this with the first example:

Input 'ab' → processing from right to left.

The characters are 'b' then 'a'.

Processing 'b': count_b=1.

Processing 'a': steps = 2^1-1=1 → result=1. Then count_b=1+1=2. So result is 1. Correct.

Second example: 'aab' → processing from right to left.

Characters are 'b', 'a', 'a'.

Processing 'b': count_b=1.

Processing the middle 'a' (the second 'a' in the input):

steps = 2^1-1=1 → result=1. count_b becomes 1+1=2.

Processing the first 'a' (leftmost 'a'):

steps = 2^2-1=3 → result=1+3=4. But wait, the sample output is 3. So this approach gives 4, which is incorrect.

Hmm. So this suggests the approach is wrong. So where's the mistake?

In the second example, the input is 'aab'. Processing from right to left:

1. 'b' → count_b=1.

2. middle 'a' (second character):

steps = 2^1-1=1 → result=1. count_b becomes 1+1=2.

3. first 'a' (first character):

steps = 2^2-1=3 → result=4. So the algorithm would return 4 mod 1e9+7. But the correct answer is 3. So this approach is wrong.

So why is that?

Because the model is incorrect. Because in the 'aab' case, the actual steps are 3. But according to this algorithm, the steps are 1+3=4. So there's a mistake here.

So what's wrong with the model.

Ah! Because when processing 'a's from right to left, the count_b represents the total 'b's after the current 'a' (including those added by previous 'a's). But when an 'a' is processed, the steps are (2^count_b -1), but each of those steps adds new 'b's which are cumulative. However, perhaps the model should track the current multiplier for the steps of the 'a's to the left.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you process an 'a', the steps for it are (2^count_b -1), but the 'count_b' for the 'a's to the left is not just count_b + steps, but rather count_b multiplied by 2 each time. Because each 'ab' replacement doubles the number of 'b's in some way.

Alternatively, let's think recursively. For an 'a' followed by m 'b's:

The first replacement of 'ab' gives 'bba', which adds one 'b' (since 'ab' is 2 chars, replaced by 3 chars, which is a net +1). But each of those steps generates new 'ab's. For example, replacing 'ab' with 'bba' gives 'bba', which has 'bb' followed by 'a'. If the 'a' is followed by existing 'b's, then each 'a' in the transformed string can generate more steps.

So the total steps for an 'a' followed by m 'b's is 2^m -1. For example:

m=1 → 1 step.

m=2 → 3 steps (1+2 steps).

But how to model this in the algorithm.

So perhaps the correct model is that each 'a' contributes steps equal to (2^{count_b} -1), and the count_b for the next 'a's to the left is multiplied by 2 each time.

Wait, for example, when an 'a' is processed, and it has count_b 'b's after it, then the steps are (2^count_b -1), and the new count_b is count_b * 2. Because replacing each 'ab' creates two 'b's, which doubles the number of 'b's.

Wait, let's test this:

Original 'aab' processed from right to left.

First 'b' → count_b=1.

Second 'a' (middle):

steps = 2^1-1=1 → result=1. count_b becomes 1 * 2 =2.

Third 'a' (left):

steps=2^2 -1=3 → result=4. count_b becomes 2*2=4.

But the correct answer is 3. So this model is not correct.

Hmm. So the problem is that the model's count_b isn't correctly tracking the number of 'b's after the 'a's to the left.

Alternative idea:

Each time an 'a' is processed, the steps contributed are (2^{current_b} -1), and the current_b is increased by 2^{current_b} -1.

But how.

Let me try the second example again:

Processing from right to left:

Initial count_b=0.

Process 'b' → count_b=1.

Process middle 'a' (second 'a'):

steps = 2^1 -1 =1. result=1. count_b += (steps) → 1+1=2.

Process first 'a':

steps = 2^2-1=3. result=4. count_b=2+3=5.

But sample answer is 3. So this is incorrect.

So why is the model not working?

Maybe the model needs to track a multiplier that is updated with each 'a' processed.

Alternative approach:

Let’s track two variables: the current number of 'b's (count_b) and a multiplier (pow2). The multiplier represents how many times the steps from previous 'a's have contributed to the current 'a's steps.

For example, when processing an 'a', the steps it contributes are (pow2 * (2^count_b -1)), and then pow2 is multiplied by 2^count_b.

This is because each 'a' to the left will have their steps multiplied by the number of times the current 'a's processing has caused expansions.

Let’s see:

Initialize count_b=0, pow2=1, result=0.

Process characters from right to left.

For each character:

- if 'b', increment count_b by 1.

- if 'a':

   steps = (pow2 * (2^count_b -1)) % MOD

   result += steps

   pow2 = (pow2 * 2^count_b) % MOD

   count_b remains the same? Or how?

Wait, but 'count_b' is the number of 'b's after the current 'a'. But when we process an 'a', the steps contribute new 'b's. But how?

Alternatively, when processing an 'a', the steps it contributes is (pow2 * (2^count_b -1)), which accounts for the expansions caused by previous 'a's. Then, the multiplier for future 'a's is increased by 2^count_b, because each of the steps taken by this 'a' will generate new 'ab's that will be processed by future 'a's.

Let me test this model with the first example:

Input 'ab' → processing from right to left.

Characters: 'b', 'a'.

Processing 'b': count_b=1.

Processing 'a':

steps = 1 * (2^1 -1) =1. result=1.

pow2 = 1 * 2^1 =2.

But since there are no more 'a's, the result is 1. Correct.

Second example: 'aab' → 'b','a','a'.

Processing 'b': count_b=1.

Processing middle 'a' (second 'a'):

steps =1 * (2^1-1) =1. result=1.

pow2 =1 * 2^1=2.

Processing first 'a':

count_b is still 1? Because processing the 'a' adds steps, but the count_b is the original 'b's plus any added by processing.

Wait, no. The 'count_b' here is the number of original 'b's to the right of the current 'a', but the model is not considering the 'b's added by previous 'a's.

So this model is not correct. But perhaps 'count_b' represents the number of original 'b's, and the multiplier accounts for the expansion due to processing.

Let me re-examine the 'aab' case:

Original 'aab' is two 'a's followed by a 'b'.

Processing from right to left:

First character is 'b' → count_b=1.

Second character is 'a' (middle 'a'):

steps = 1 * (2^1-1) =1. result=1.

pow2 becomes 1 * 2^1 =2.

Third character is 'a' (first 'a'):

steps =2 * (2^0 -1) → because after processing the 'b' and middle 'a', count_b is now 0? No, this model doesn't track the 'b's added by processing.

Hmm, this suggests that the model is not tracking the 'b's correctly. So perhaps the count_b should not be modified when processing 'a's. Instead, count_b is the number of original 'b's to the right of the current 'a'. The multiplier pow2 is the product of 2^{count_b} for each 'a' to the right. 

Alternatively, perhaps the count_b is the number of 'b's that are to the right of the current 'a' in the original string. But the steps are multiplied by 2^{k}, where k is the number of 'a's to the right of the current 'a'. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern.

For the 'aab' example:

The first 'a' (position 0) is followed by one 'a' and one 'b'. The second 'a' (position 1) is followed by one 'b'.

When processing from right to left:

The second 'a' (position 1) is processed first. It has one 'b' to its right. So steps contributed by this 'a' is 2^1-1=1. Then, when processing the first 'a' (position 0), it is followed by the second 'a' (which has been processed into steps and possibly added new 'b's). The number of 'b's that the first 'a' sees is now 1 (original 'b') plus the 'b's added by processing the second 'a' (which was 1 step, adding 1 'b'). So total 'b's after the first 'a' is 2. So steps contributed by the first 'a' is 2^2-1=3. Total steps 1+3=4. But the correct answer is 3.

Hmm. So this model is still wrong.

Alternative idea: perhaps the order of processing is left to right.

Let's consider processing the 'a's in left to right order, and track the number of 'b's that are generated by each 'a' processing.

For example:

In 'aab', the first 'a' is followed by 'a' and 'b'. Initially, there are no 'b's after the first 'a' (since the next character is 'a'). So the first 'a' doesn't contribute any steps. The second 'a' is followed by a 'b' and contributes 1 step. Then, after processing the second 'a', the first 'a' is now followed by 'bba' + 'b' (from the replacement of 'ab' into 'bba'). So the first 'a' now has 'b's after it. Let's see:

Original 'aab' → after processing the second 'a's 'ab' (the 'ab' is between the second 'a' and the 'b'):

The string becomes 'a' + 'bba' → 'abba'. Now, the first 'a' is followed by 'b's. So the 'a' at position 0 in the new string is followed by 'b', 'b', 'a'. So the first 'a' is followed by two 'b's. So processing this 'ab' (between first 'a' and first 'b') will take 3 steps (as in the example).

So total steps: 1 (from second 'a') + 2 steps from first 'a's processing. But the example shows three steps. So this approach isn't adding up.

Alternatively, the first 'a's processing contributes 2 steps. So total steps 1+2=3. Which matches the example.

But how to model this.

So for each 'a', the steps contributed depend on the number of 'b's after it, which can be influenced by the steps taken by 'a's to the right. So when processing 'a's from left to right, each 'a's steps contribute based on the 'b's that are present after it, including those added by previous 'a's processed to the right.

So perhaps the correct approach is to process 'a's from left to right, and track the number of 'b's that have been generated by the steps taken so far.

Wait, but for 'aab':

Processing the left 'a' first. But since it's followed by 'a' and 'b', there's no 'ab' initially. So the left 'a' doesn't contribute steps. Then process the second 'a', which is followed by 'b', contributing 1 step. Then, the string becomes 'abba', where the left 'a' is followed by 'b's, contributing 2 steps. So total steps 3.

So how to model this.

Let’s think of the following variables:

- total_steps: the answer we need to compute.

- current_multiplier: the factor by which each 'b' after an 'a' contributes to the steps.

- count_b: the number of 'b's accumulated so far (from the steps taken).

Wait, perhaps not. Another idea: for each 'a' in the original string, the steps contributed by this 'a' depend on the number of 'b's that come after it in the original string, plus the 'b's added by previous 'a's processed to the left.

For example, when processing 'a's from left to right:

For each 'a', the steps are (2^{original_b_count + added_b_count} -1) * multiplier. But this may not be tractable for large n.

Alternatively, track two variables:

- added_b: the number of 'b's added due to steps taken so far.

- multiplier: a factor that represents how many times each 'b' contributes to the steps.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the need to process 'a's and track the multiplicative effect:

We can track the number of 'b's encountered so far (original and added) as we process the string from left to right. For each 'a', the steps it contributes are based on the number of 'b's that are after it, but this is a dynamic value that increases as previous 'a's are processed.

However, processing from left to right, each 'a' can be processed when we encounter it. The steps contributed by this 'a' will be (2^{current_b} -1) multiplied by a certain factor. But how to track the factor.

Another way to think: each time we process an 'a', the steps it contributes are multiplied by 2^k, where k is the number of times previous 'a's have been processed. This is similar to the way that each previous 'a's processing could multiply the steps of the current 'a's steps.

But I'm not sure.

Let me refer to the solution for this problem.

Research: The problem is similar to counting the number of steps required to replace all "ab" occurrences with "bba", and the minimal steps required. 

This problem has a known solution where each 'a' contributes steps equal to (2^{current_count} - 1), where current_count is the number of 'b's accumulated so far, and each 'a' increments the current_count by (2^{current_count} -1) 'b's.

Wait, perhaps the correct model is:

Initialize count_b =0 and steps=0.

Traverse the string from left to right.

When you encounter a 'b', increment count_b by 1.

When you encounter an 'a':

   steps += (2^{count_b} -1)

   steps %= MOD

   count_b = (count_b * 2 + 1) % MOD

Wait, let's test this.

First example:

Input 'ab' → left to right.

First character is 'a':

steps += 2^0 -1 =0. steps=0.

count_b =0*2 +1=1.

Next character is 'b':

count_b becomes 2 (since we increment by 1). But no steps added.

Wait, but the steps should be 1. This model gives 0 steps.

So this approach is incorrect.

Alternative model:

Traverse the string from left to right. For each 'a', track the number of 'b's that come after it, and the steps contributed. But this requires looking ahead, which is not efficient.

Alternative approach:

The key insight is that each 'a' in the string will generate steps based on the number of 'b's after it. However, each 'a' that is processed (i.e., its 'ab's are replaced) will generate additional 'b's which must be accounted for by the 'a's to the left. So processing 'a's from right to left allows us to compute the steps for each 'a' based on the 'b's that are originally after it plus the 'b's added by 'a's processed to the right.

Let’s model this as follows:

- Initialize variables: total_steps =0, count_b=0 (number of 'b's encountered so far), and pow2 =1 (the multiplier for steps due to previous 'a's).

- Traverse the string from right to left.

- For each character:

   if it's 'b', increment count_b by 1.

   else (it's 'a'):

      steps = (pow2 * (2^count_b -1)) % MOD

      total_steps = (total_steps + steps) % MOD

      pow2 = (pow2 * (2^count_b)) % MOD

This model seems promising.

Let me test this model with the second example 'aab':

Traversing from right to left:

Processing 'b' → count_b=1.

Processing middle 'a' (second 'a'):

steps =1 * (2^1 -1) =1. total_steps=1.

pow2 becomes 1 * 2^1 =2.

Processing first 'a' (first character):

steps=2 * (2^0 -1) → 2*(1-1)=0. total_steps remains 1.

But the correct answer is 3. So this is incorrect.

Wait, what's the count_b for the first 'a'? When processing the first 'a', count_b is 0 (since we haven't processed any 'b's after it). Because after processing the middle 'a', we didn't process any 'b's.

Ah, here's the problem. The count_b is not being tracked correctly. Because when processing from right to left, 'b's are encountered first. So in 'aab', the order of characters processed is 'b', 'a', 'a'.

Processing 'b' → count_b=1.

Processing middle 'a' → steps =1*(2^1 -1)=1. total_steps=1. pow2=1*2^1=2.

Processing first 'a' → count_b is 0 (because after processing the first 'a', which is the leftmost, the 'b's are to the right. But when processing left to right, the 'b's are processed first. So when processing from right to left, after the first two steps (processing 'b' and middle 'a'), we then process the first 'a', which has no 'b's to its right in the original string. So count_b is 0.

Thus, steps for first 'a' is 2*(2^0 -1) =0. So total steps 1. But the correct answer is 3.

So this model is incorrect.

But why?

Because the first 'a' in the original string is followed by two 'a's and a 'b'. But when processing from right to left, the first 'a' (leftmost) is processed last. However, the 'b's after it in the original string are the middle 'a' and the 'b', but 'a's are not 'b's. So the count_b for the first 'a' is 0.

So the model isn't considering the 'b's added by processing the middle 'a'.

Ah! Here's the crux of the problem. The 'count_b' variable only tracks the original 'b's, not the 'b's added by processing previous 'a's. So the model is not considering the 'b's generated by processing 'a's to the right of the current 'a'.

Thus, the model needs to account for the 'b's added by processing 'a's to the right.

How to track the added 'b's?

Let me think. When an 'a' is processed, the steps it contributes are based on the number of 'b's (original and added) to its right. But how to calculate this.

When processing an 'a' from right to left:

- The number of 'b's to the right of this 'a' includes both the original 'b's and those added by processing 'a's that are to the right (which have already been processed).

But how to compute this.

The steps contributed by the current 'a' is (2^current_b -1) multiplied by the product of 2^{count_b of all 'a's to the right}.

Thus, the multiplier pow2 should be used to track this product.

For example, when processing the middle 'a' in the 'aab' example:

count_b is 1 (original 'b's).

steps = pow2 * (2^count_b -1) → 1*(1) =1.

pow2 becomes pow2 * 2^count_b → 1 * 2^1 =2.

Then, when processing the first 'a', count_b is 0 (original 'b's after it). But the pow2 is 2. steps = 2*(2^0-1) → 2*(0) =0. So total steps 1.

But the correct answer is 3.

This suggests that the model is not tracking the 'b's added by previous 'a's. The count_b variable must include the 'b's added by processing the 'a's to the right.

So how to track this.

Let me consider that each 'a' processed contributes to the number of 'b's available for the 'a's to the left. The steps taken by an 'a' add (2^count_b -1) 'b's to the count_b.

So, when processing an 'a', the steps are (2^count_b -1), and the count_b is increased by that amount.

But how to model this for 'a's processed from right to left.

Let me try this model:

Initialize count_b =0, total_steps=0.

Process the string from right to left.

For each character:

- if 'b', count_b +=1.

- if 'a':

   steps = (2^count_b -1) % MOD

   total_steps = (total_steps + steps) % MOD

   count_b = (count_b + steps) % MOD

Let's test this for 'aab':

Processing 'b' → count_b=1.

Processing middle 'a' (second 'a'):

steps=2^1-1=1 → total_steps=1. count_b=1+1=2.

Processing first 'a':

steps=2^2-1=3 → total_steps=4. count_b=2+3=5.

But sample output is 3. So this model is incorrect.

But according to the sample's explanation, the steps are 3. So why is this model giving 4?

Hmm. This suggests that the model is not correctly capturing the dependencies between 'a's. 

Alternative idea: perhaps the count_b should be multiplied by 2 each time an 'a' is processed. For example:

When processing an 'a', the steps are (2^count_b -1), and the count_b is multiplied by 2.

Let's test this.

For 'ab' → processing 'b' (count_b=1). Then 'a' steps=1. count_b becomes 2. So steps 1. Correct.

For 'aab':

Processing 'b' → count_b=1.

Middle 'a' steps=1 → count_b=2.

First 'a' steps=2^2-1=3 → steps total=4. count_b=4. So answer is4, but sample expects 3. So still incorrect.

Hmm. This suggests that the model is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 'count_b' variable should be the number of 'b's that are generated by the current 'a's processing, not the total 'b's after processing all 'a's.

But how.

Let me think differently. Suppose we have a string like 'aab'. Processing from right to left:

The 'b' is first, count_b=1.

The middle 'a' (second 'a') contributes steps=1. Then count_b is updated to 1 +1 =2.

The first 'a' contributes steps=3 (2^2-1=3). total steps=4. But sample expects 3.

But according to the sample, the steps are:

1. Replace the 'ab' in positions 1-2 → steps 1.

2. Replace the 'ab' in positions 0-1 → steps 2.

3. Replace the 'ab' in positions 2-3 → steps 3.

Total steps 3.

So why is the model giving 4?

Because the model is counting the steps for each 'a' based on the 'b's to the right, but when the first 'a' is processed, the 'count_b' is 2, which includes the steps from the middle 'a'. However, in reality, the 'b's after the first 'a' are the original 'b' plus the steps from the middle 'a' (which added 1 'b'). So the total 'b's after the first 'a' is 1+1=2. So steps for the first 'a' are 3 (2^2-1=3). But according to the sample, this 'a' contributes 3 steps, which would bring the total to 4. But the sample's answer is 3. So there's a discrepancy.

So this suggests that the model is correct and the sample's explanation is incorrect. But that's unlikely.

Wait, the sample's input is 'aab' → steps 3. The model's calculation gives 4. So this indicates that the model is wrong.

But according to the sample's explanation:

Steps:

1. Replace the 'ab' (positions 1 and 2) → step 1. String becomes 'abba'.

2. Replace the 'ab' (positions 0 and 1) → step 2. String becomes 'bbaba'.

3. Replace the 'ab' (positions 2 and 3) → step 3. String becomes 'bbbbaa'.

Total steps 3. So the model's answer of 4 is wrong.

So why the discrepancy?

Because the model is considering that each 'a' contributes (2^count_b -1) steps, which for the first 'a' in 'aab' gives 3 steps, but according to the sample, the first 'a' contributes 3 steps. But according to the model, the middle 'a' contributes 1 step, and the first 'a' contributes 3 steps. Total 4.

But according to the sample, it's 3. So why?

Ah! Because the model is counting the steps contributed by each 'a' in the original string, but the steps are not additive in that way. The order of processing affects how the steps are counted. 

The model assumes that each 'a' is processed once, but in reality, processing an 'a' can create new 'a's which are processed as well. For example, replacing 'ab' with 'bba' introduces a new 'a' which may form new 'ab's. So the model must account for all 'a's, including those added by previous steps.

But for large input sizes, we can't simulate this. Hence, the need for a mathematical approach that can account for all steps contributed by each original 'a' and their subsequent transformations.

So perhaps the correct model is to process 'a's from left to right, and track the number of 'b's and a multiplier that represents how many times each 'a's steps are multiplied due to previous transformations.

Let me try this approach:

Initialize variables:

- total_steps =0

- current_b =0 (number of 'b's encountered so far)

- multiplier =1 (the multiplicative factor due to previous 'a's' steps)

For each character in the string from left to right:

   if it's 'b', increment current_b by multiplier.

   else:

      steps = (2^current_b -1) * multiplier

      total_steps += steps

      multiplier *= 2^current_b

      current_b remains unchanged.

Let me test this model.

First example: 'ab'.

Processing left to right.

First character 'a':

current_b is 0 (no 'b's yet).

steps = (2^0-1)*1 =0.

total_steps=0.

multiplier becomes 1*1=1.

current_b remains 0.

Next character 'b':

current_b += multiplier → 0 +1=1.

total_steps remains 0.

But the correct answer is 1. So this model is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: For each 'a', the steps are (2^current_b -1) multiplied by the multiplier. The multiplier is the product of 2^current_b of previous 'a's. And each 'a' increases the multiplier for future 'a's by 2^current_b.

Wait, but how.

Let me try the 'aab' case with this model:

Processing left to right.

First character 'a':

current_b=0.

steps=(2^0-1)*1=0.

multiplier becomes 1 * 2^0=1*1=1.

current_b remains 0.

Second character 'a':

current_b=0.

steps=(2^0-1)*1=0.

multiplier becomes 1*1=1.

current_b remains 0.

Third character 'b':

current_b += multiplier → 0 +1=1.

total_steps=0.

But the correct answer is 3. So this model is incorrect.

This approach isn't working.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that each 'a' contributes steps based on the number of 'b's after it, and each such 'a's steps can be modeled as follows:

Each 'a' with m 'b's after it in the original string contributes steps equal to 2^m - 1 multiplied by 2^{sum of previous 'a's' m} }.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct formula is that the total steps is the sum for each 'a' of (2^{k} -1) * 2^{c}, where k is the number of 'b's after the 'a' in the original string, and c is the number of 'a's that come after it.

But in the 'aab' example, the first 'a' has one 'b' after it (the original 'b') and one 'a' after it. The second 'a' has one 'b' after it. So:

First 'a': (2^1 -1) * 2^1 = (1) * 2=2.

Second 'a': (2^1 -1)*2^0=1*1=1.

Total 3. Which matches the sample.

Ah! So this seems to be the correct approach.

So the steps contributed by each 'a' are (2^{b} -1) * 2^{a_count}, where:

- b is the number of 'b's after this 'a' in the original string.

- a_count is the number of 'a's that come after this 'a' in the original string.

Thus, the total steps are the sum of (2^b -1)*2^{a_count} for each 'a'.

For example, in the 'aab' case:

The first 'a' (position 0) has one 'b' after it (position 2) and one 'a' after it (position 1). So a_count for this 'a' is 1.

So contribution: (2^1 -1)*2^1 =1*2=2.

The second 'a' (position 1) has one 'b' after it (position 2) and zero 'a's after it. So contribution: (2^1-1)*2^0=1*1=1.

Total steps 3.

This matches the sample.

Another example: 'ab' has one 'a' followed by one 'b'. a_count is 0. Contribution (2^1-1)*2^0=1*1=1.

Correct.

So the formula is:

For each 'a' in the original string, compute the number of 'b's after it (original_b), the number of 'a's after it (original_a), and add (2^{original_b} -1) * 2^{original_a} to the total.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The approach is to precompute for each 'a' the number of 'b's and 'a's after it.

This can be done by traversing the string from right to left, keeping track of the cumulative count of 'b's and 'a's.

For each character:

- if it's 'a', record the current 'b_count' and 'a_count', then increment a_count.

- if it's 'b', increment b_count.

But wait, since we're processing from right to left, for each 'a' encountered, the 'b_count' is the number of 'b's to its right (original), and the 'a_count' is the number of 'a's to its right (original).

Thus, the steps for each 'a' are (2^b_count -1) * 2^a_count.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize:

- b_count =0

- a_count =0

- total_steps=0

- precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD up to 1e6.

Process the string from right to left:

for c in reversed(s):

   if c == 'b':

      b_count +=1

   else:

      term = (pow(2, b_count, MOD) -1) * pow(2, a_count, MOD)

      total_steps = (total_steps + term) % MOD

      a_count +=1

This would work, but the pow(2, a_count) could be computed cumulatively.

We can optimize by tracking the exponent for a_count as we go.

Initialize:

b_count =0

pow_a =1 (since 2^0 =1)

total_steps=0

Processing from right to left:

for each character in reversed(s):

   if c == 'b':

      b_count +=1

   else:

      term = (pow(2, b_count, MOD) -1) * pow_a

      total_steps = (total_steps + term) % MOD

      pow_a = (pow_a * 2) % MOD

Because each time we encounter an 'a', the next 'a's to the left will have their a_count increased by 1, which means their 2^a_count is multiplied by 2.

This way, pow_a represents 2^{number of 'a's processed so far} (i.e., 2^a_count for the current 'a').

Let's test this with the 'aab' example.

Processing from right to left:

Character 'b' → b_count=1.

Character 'a' (second 'a'):

term = (2^1 -1) * 1 → 1*1=1. total_steps=1.

pow_a becomes 2.

Character 'a' (first 'a'):

term = (2^0 -1) *2 → (1-1)*2=0. total_steps remains 1.

But the correct answer is 3. So this is incorrect.

Wait, why?

Because the first 'a' (leftmost) in 'aab' has a_count=1 (number of 'a's to its right), but in this model, the pow_a is 2 when processing the first 'a', which is correct (2^1=2). But the b_count is 0 for the first 'a', since there are no 'b's to its right in the original string.

But in the 'aab' example, the first 'a' is followed by another 'a' and then a 'b', so the original 'b_count' for this 'a' is 1. However, when processing from right to left, after processing the second 'a' (middle 'a'), the b_count is 1. Then, when processing the first 'a', the 'b_count' is 0 (because the first 'a' is the leftmost character, and the 'b's after it are in the middle 'a' and 'b', but 'a's are not 'b's. So the original 'b's after the first 'a' are 1 (the 'b' at the end).

Ah! So the model's processing is not correctly tracking the 'b_count' for the first 'a' in 'aab'.

Wait, when processing the first 'a' (leftmost) in 'aab', the processing order is right to left. So the first 'a' processed is the 'b', then the middle 'a', then the first 'a'.

So processing 'b' → b_count=1.

Processing middle 'a' → term is (2^1 -1)*1=1. total_steps=1. pow_a=2.

Processing first 'a' → now, the b_count is 0, because after processing the middle 'a', there's no 'b's encountered yet for the first 'a' (since we're processing from right to left).

So the first 'a' is processed after the middle 'a' and the 'b'. But in the original string, the first 'a' has one 'b' to its right. However, during processing from right to left, the 'b' is processed first, then the middle 'a', then the first 'a'. So when processing the first 'a', the b_count is 0, because after processing the middle 'a', the code has already processed the 'b's to the right of the middle 'a' but not those to the right of the first 'a'.

Wait, no. The code processes the string from right to left. So for 'aab', the characters are processed in the order: 'b', then 'a', then 'a'.

When processing 'b', b_count is incremented to 1.

Processing the middle 'a' (second character in the original string), which is the second character processed. The code calculates term using b_count=1. Then, pow_a becomes 2.

Processing the first 'a' (original first character), which is the third character processed. At this point, since we have moved left past the 'b', the code's b_count is 0. Because during processing from right to left, the first 'a' is the leftmost character, and the 'b' and middle 'a' are to its right. But when processing the first 'a' (leftmost), the code hasn't encountered any 'b's yet in this iteration. Because the code processes characters from the end.

Thus, for the first 'a' in the original string, the 'b_count' is 0, and the pow_a is 2. So the term is (2^0 -1) * 2 → 0.

So the model's total_steps is 1, but the correct answer is 3.

This suggests that the model is incorrect because it does not account for the 'b's that are to the right of the 'a' in the original string. Because when processing from right to left, the 'b's are counted after the 'a' is processed.

Ah! So the model is not correct. The 'b_count' variable tracks the number of 'b's encountered so far during the right-to-left traversal. So for the first 'a' in the original string (leftmost), the 'b_count' is the number of 'b's to the right of it. But during the right-to-left traversal, the 'b's to the right of the first 'a' have already been processed, so the 'b_count' should be the total 'b's in the original string to the right of the current 'a'.

Thus, the model must track the 'b_count' as the number of 'b's to the right of the current 'a' in the original string. This can be done by precomputing a suffix sum of 'b's.

For example, precompute for each position i in the string the number of 'b's from i+1 to the end.

This can be done with a simple array.

For example, for 'aab', the suffix 'b' counts would be:

Position 0 (first 'a'): two characters after it: 'a' and 'b' → 'a' has 1 'b' to the right.

Position 1 (middle 'a'): one 'b' to the right.

Position 2 (third 'b'): 0 'b's to the right.

So, for each 'a' in the original string, the suffix_b_count is the number of 'b's after it.

Thus, the correct approach is:

1. Precompute the suffix_b_count array.

2. Precompute the suffix_a_count array, which is the number of 'a's after each position.

But since we process 'a's from right to left, we can compute the suffix_a_count dynamically.

But perhaps the easiest way is to precompute the suffix_b_count array and then process the string from left to right, keeping track of the number of 'a's encountered so far.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the correct formula for each 'a':

steps_contributed = (2^{suffix_b_count[i]} -1) * 2^{suffix_a_count[i]},

where suffix_b_count[i] is the number of 'b's after position i, and suffix_a_count[i] is the number of 'a's after position i.

Thus, for each 'a' in the original string, the steps are (2^b -1)*2^a, where b is the number of 'b's after it, and a is the number of 'a's after it.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

Compute suffix_b and suffix_a arrays.

Then, for each 'a' in the original string, compute (2^b -1)*2^a and sum.

This can be done efficiently with precomputed powers of 2.

Let's test this for 'aab':

suffix_b for positions:

pos 0 (first 'a') → 'aab' → suffix_b=1.

pos 1 (second 'a') → 'ab' → suffix_b=1.

pos 2 (b) → suffix_b=0.

For each 'a':

At pos 0: suffix_b=1, suffix_a=1 (since there is one 'a' after it).

contribution: (2^1-1)*2^1=1*2=2.

At pos 1: suffix_b=1, suffix_a=0 (no 'a's after it).

contribution: (2^1-1)*1=1.

Total 3.

Correct.

For the first example 'ab':

pos 0 'a' → suffix_b=1, suffix_a=0.

contribution: (2^1-1)*1=1.

Total 1. Correct.

Another example: 'abb' → 'a' followed by two 'b's.

suffix_b for pos 0 is 2.

suffix_a is 0.

contribution: (2^2-1)*1=3. So steps=3.

Which matches the example where 'abb' would take 3 steps.

Thus, this approach is correct.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute suffix_b for each position.

2. Precompute suffix_a for each position.

3. For each 'a' in the string, compute (2^{suffix_b[i]} -1) * (2^{suffix_a[i]}) mod MOD.

4. Sum all these values mod MOD.

The problem now is to compute these suffix_b and suffix_a arrays efficiently.

For a string of length up to 1e6, we can compute the suffix arrays in O(n) time.

For suffix_b:

Initialize a list of size n+1.

suffix_b[n] = 0.

For i from n-1 down to 0:

   suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i] == 'b' else 0)

Similarly for suffix_a:

suffix_a[i] = number of 'a's after position i.

We can compute it similarly:

suffix_a[n] =0.

for i from n-1 down to 0:

   suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i] == 'a' else 0)

Wait, no. Because when processing from the end, the 'a's after position i are those in positions i+1, i+2, ..., n-1.

Thus, for i, suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0).

Wait, no. Wait, the suffix_a[i] is the number of 'a's in positions i+1 to n-1.

So for example, in 'aab' (positions 0,1,2 are 'a','a','b'):

suffix_a[0] is number of 'a's in positions 1 and 2 → 1 ('a' at 1).

suffix_a[1] is number of 'a's in positions 2 → 0.

Thus, to compute suffix_a correctly:

We need to initialize a suffix_a array where suffix_a[i] is the number of 'a's in positions i+1 to n-1.

Thus:

suffix_a[n-1] = 0 (no positions after n-1).

For i from n-2 down to 0:

   suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0)

For example:

In 'aab' (indices 0,1,2):

i=0:

suffix_a[0] = suffix_a[1] + (s[1] == 'a' → 1)

suffix_a[1] is computed as follows:

i=1:

suffix_a[1] = suffix_a[2] + (s[2] == 'a' → 0 → 0.

i=0:

suffix_a[0] =0+1=1.

Correct.

Thus, the correct way to compute suffix_a is:

suffix_a = [0]*(n)

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):

   suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0)

Similarly for suffix_b:

suffix_b = [0]*(n)

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):

   suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'b' else 0)

Wait, no. For suffix_b[i], it's the number of 'b's in positions i+1 to n-1.

Yes.

Thus, for each 'a' in the original string, at position i, the suffix_b[i] is the number of 'b's after it, and suffix_a[i] is the number of 'a's after it.

Then, the contribution is (2^suffix_b[i] -1) * (2^suffix_a[i}) mod MOD.

So the steps are:

Compute suffix_b and suffix_a arrays.

Precompute power of 2 up to the maximum possible suffix_b and suffix_a values (up to 1e6 each).

For each 'a' in the string, compute (pow(2, suffix_b[i], MOD) -1) * pow(2, suffix_a[i], MOD) mod MOD.

Sum all these values.

But for a string of 1e6 characters, this would be O(n) time and O(n) space.

But for 1e6, this is manageable.

However, we can optimize space by computing the suffix_b and suffix_a on the fly during a single pass, without storing the entire arrays.

But in practice, for Python, even 1e6 elements are manageable.

But let's proceed with the code.

First, read the input string s.

n = len(s)

Compute suffix_b and suffix_a arrays.

Then, precompute pow2 for up to max(suffix_b) and max(suffix_a).

But for each 'a' in the string, we need to calculate (2^b -1) * (2^a) mod MOD.

But since exponents can be up to 1e6, we need to compute pow(2, x) mod MOD quickly.

In Python, pow(2, x, MOD) is efficient, as it uses exponentiation by squaring.

So for each 'a' at position i:

term = (pow(2, suffix_b[i], MOD) -1) * pow(2, suffix_a[i], MOD) % MOD

sum all terms.

Let's implement this.

Now, let's test this code for the 'aab' example.

s = 'aab' → indices 0,1,2.

Compute suffix_b:

suffix_b[0] = number of 'b's after position 0.

positions 1 and 2: 'a' and 'b' → 1 'b'.

suffix_b[0] =1.

suffix_b[1] = number of 'b's after position 1 (positions 2: 'b') →1.

suffix_b[2] =0.

suffix_a:

suffix_a[i] is number of 'a's after position i.

suffix_a[0]: positions 1 and 2. Only position 1 is 'a' → 1.

suffix_a[1]: positions 2 → no 'a's → 0.

suffix_a[2]: 0.

For each 'a' in s:

positions 0 and 1 are 'a's.

For i=0:

suffix_b[0] =1, suffix_a[0] =1.

term = (2^1-1)*2^1 = (1)*2 =2.

For i=1:

suffix_b[1]=1, suffix_a[1]=0.

term =1*1=1.

Total steps 3. Correct.

Thus, this approach works.

Now, to implement this in Python.

But how to compute suffix_b and suffix_a.

For suffix_b:

Initialize a list of size n.

Set suffix_b[-1] =0.

Then for i from n-2 down to 0:

   suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'b' else 0)

Similarly for suffix_a.

Thus, code:

n = len(s)
MOD = 10**9+7

if n ==0:
    print(0)
    exit()

suffix_b = [0]*n
suffix_a = [0]*n

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'b' else 0)
    suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0)

total =0

for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'a':
        b = suffix_b[i]
        a = suffix_a[i]
        term = (pow(2, b, MOD) -1) * pow(2, a, MOD) % MOD
        total = (total + term) % MOD

print(total)

This should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    n = len(s)
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    if n == 0:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return

    # Compute suffix_b and suffix_a arrays
    suffix_b = [0] * n
    suffix_a = [0] * n

    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'b' else 0)
        suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0)

    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'a':
            b = suffix_b[i]
            a = suffix_a[i]
            term = (pow(2, b, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, a, MOD) % MOD
            total = (total + term) % MOD

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()

```

Second sample: 'aab' → 'a's at 0 and 1.

For i=0:

suffix_b[0] =1 (positions 1 and 2: 'a' and 'b' → one 'b').

suffix_a[0] =1 (position 1 is 'a').

term=(1)*2=2.

For i=1:

suffix_b[1] =1 (position 2 is 'b').

suffix_a[1] =0.

term=1*1=1.

Total 3.

Correct.

Thus, this code should work.

Now, optimize for memory. For a string of 1e6 characters, the suffix_b and suffix_a arrays would each take 1e6 integers, which is manageable. But perhaps we can compute the suffix_b and suffix_a values on the fly without storing arrays.

But for the sake of code clarity and given that 1e6 is manageable, the current approach is acceptable.

Thus, the final code is as written.
</think>

```python
s = input().strip()
n = len(s)
MOD = 10**9 + 7

if n == 0:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Compute suffix_b and suffix_a arrays
suffix_b = [0] * n
suffix_a = [0] * n

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    suffix_b[i] = suffix_b[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'b' else 0)
    suffix_a[i] = suffix_a[i+1] + (1 if s[i+1] == 'a' else 0)

total = 0
for i in range(n):

        b = suffix_b[i]
        a = suffix_a[i]

        total = (total + term) % MOD

print(total)
```
