<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to parse a simplified HTML-like structure and find the number of cells in each table. The output should be all the table sizes sorted in non-decreasing order. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the structure of the input. The input is a string made by concatenating all the input lines. The tags are table, tr, td, and they are properly nested. Each table must have at least one row and each row at least one cell. Tables can be nested inside other tables via td elements.

The main challenge is to parse the nested tables correctly and calculate their cell counts. So, whenever a table is opened, we need to track its cells. Each table's cell count is the sum of all the td elements directly inside its tr elements. But wait, wait. Because tr is a row, and each tr can contain multiple td's. So for each table, the total cells are the sum of all td's in each of its tr tags. But nested tables are inside td's, right? So each td can contain another table, but that's part of the outer td's content. So when processing a table, we need to count the td elements that are direct children of tr elements within that table.

So the approach here is to use a stack-based parser. Each time we encounter a <table> tag, we push a new counter onto the stack. Then, when we process a </table> tag, we pop the counter and record the total cells for that table. For the td tags, when we open a <td>, we might need to check if it's part of a current table's row. Wait, but how do we track the hierarchy correctly?

Let me think. The structure is like: table contains trs, which contain tds. So each table is built by its tr elements, each tr contributes some tds. So for each table, the total cells is the sum of the number of td's in each of its tr's. So perhaps, as we parse the tags, we need to track the current state. For example, when inside a table, when we encounter a <tr>, we start a new row. Then each <td> inside this tr contributes to the current table's cell count.

Wait, but how to track which table is the current one. Oh right, the stack can hold the current context. For example, when a <table> is opened, we push a new entry into the stack. That entry represents the current table's cell count. Then, when we process a <tr>, perhaps we need to track that we're inside a tr. Then, any <td> encountered while inside a tr (and within the current table) will increment the current table's count. But nested tables can have their own tr and td tags. So the key is to track the hierarchy properly.

So here's the plan:

Use a stack to track the current tables. Each time a <table> tag is opened, push a new counter (starting at 0) onto the stack. Then, when a <tr> is opened, we note that we are inside a tr (but maybe that's not necessary). Then, when a <td> is encountered, if we are inside a tr (which is part of the current table's structure), then we increment the top of the stack (the current table's counter) by 1. However, nested tables can have their own tr and td, which should contribute to their own parent table's counter.

Wait, but the structure is like:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>...</table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The outer table has one tr and one td. The inner table's cells are part of its own count. So, when processing the inner <table>, we push a new counter onto the stack. The inner td of the outer table is part of the outer table's count, but the inner table's tds are part of the inner counter.

So, the stack-based approach is correct. Each time a table is opened (regardless of where), a new counter is pushed. The current top of the stack is always the current table being processed. So, when we encounter a <td> tag, we need to check if we're inside a tr that's part of the current table. But how do we track that?

Ah, perhaps the hierarchy is strict. So, the tags must be properly nested. For example, after a table tag, the only allowed tags are tr (as children of the table). Then, tr's children are td. And td can contain any other tags, including another table. So when we are inside a td, we can have other tables.

Wait, the grammar for the bHTML is given. Let me look at that. The problem says:

The bHTML table's grammar is such that a TABLE is a sequence of tags starting with <table> followed by one or more <tr>, each containing one or more <td>, which can contain any other tags (including nested tables), then the closing tags.

But the exact structure isn't given here. But based on standard HTML tables, the structure is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> ... </td>
    ...
  </tr>
  ...
</table>

So each table has one or more tr, each tr has one or more td. The td's can contain arbitrary content, including other tables.

So, for parsing, whenever we are inside a table (stack not empty), and we encounter a tr, then we start a new row. Then, within that tr, any td encountered adds to the current table's cell count. However, nested tables will have their own tr and td tags, but those are part of their own tables, not the parent's.

So, the approach is:

- Use a stack to track the current tables. Each element in the stack is the cell count for that table.
- We also need to track whether we are inside a tr and a td. Wait, no. Because the td's are part of a tr. So, perhaps the steps are:

Whenever a <table> is encountered, push a new counter (0) onto the stack.

Whenever a </table> is encountered, pop the counter from the stack and add it to the list of results.

For <tr> tags, when inside a table (stack not empty?), do they affect the current state? Well, each tr starts a new row. But the problem is, how to track that the next td's are part of the current row and thus the current table.

Wait, but the structure is that a table contains tr elements, which contain td elements. So, when processing a table, any td that is a direct child of a tr (which is a direct child of the table) will count towards the table's cell count. So, the key is to track the nesting level of tr and td within the current table.

But how to model that with the stack. Let's think:

Each time a <table> is opened, we push a new counter (initially 0) to the stack. Then, when a <tr> is encountered, it's part of the current table. But each tr can have multiple <td> elements. For each td encountered inside this tr, the current table's counter increments by 1. So, perhaps the state needs to track whether we are inside a tr of the current table.

But how to track that. Let's think of the parsing steps:

- The parser is processing tags one by one.

- When we open a table (push counter).

- Then, inside the table, the next tags must be <tr>s. Each tr starts a row.

- Each tr can have <td>s. Each td adds 1 to the current table's counter.

- Then, the td can have other tags, including other tables.

So, perhaps the key is that when we are inside a tr (but not nested in any other tr), then any td encountered will add to the current table's counter.

But how to model the state. Let's think of using a stack for the current state, where each state indicates what the next allowed tags are.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to track the current context, such as:

- When inside a table, and after a <tr> but before </tr>, any <td> encountered adds to the current table's counter.

But how to track the hierarchy. For example, if a td contains another table, which has tr and td, those shouldn't affect the outer table's counter.

So, the problem is to correctly track the current table's tr and td, and ignore any td's inside nested tables.

Hmm.

An alternative approach is to track the nesting of tags. For example, when a <table> is opened, we push a new counter to the stack. Then, when inside this table, each <tr> is part of the current table, and each <td> inside that tr is added to the counter. However, any nested <table> inside the td will push a new counter, but the outer table's tr and td are already closed by that point.

Wait, perhaps when we parse the tags, whenever we see a <td> tag, we check if the current table (top of stack) is in a state where it's processing a tr. So, how to model that.

Maybe the idea is to track the current position in the hierarchy. For example, when parsing a table, the structure is:

<table> followed by one or more <tr>, each followed by one or more <td>, then </tr>, and so on until </table>.

So, the current table's state could be:

- After opening <table>, expecting <tr>.
- Inside a <tr>, expecting <td>.
- Inside a <td>, which can contain other tags (including tables), but once a <td> is closed, the next tag inside the <tr> could be another <td>, or </tr>.

So, perhaps, for the current table (the top of the stack), we need to track whether we are inside a tr and inside a td. Wait, but this might get complicated. For example, when a <td> is opened, it can contain other tags, including tables. So, the state for the current table's processing is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the only thing that matters is that the td is a direct child of a tr, which is a direct child of the current table. So, whenever a td is found directly inside a tr, which is part of the current table, then we increment the current table's counter.

So, how to track that. Let's model the parsing with a stack that tracks the current tag hierarchy. For example, the stack can keep track of the tag names (like 'table', 'tr', 'td', etc.), and their nesting. Then, whenever a <td> tag is opened, we check if the current hierarchy is table -> tr -> td. If so, then the current table (the topmost 'table' in the stack) gets a +1 to its counter.

Wait, but the stack would have all the open tags. So, for example, when parsing a <td> inside a tr inside a table, the stack would be something like [ 'table', 'tr', 'td' ].

But in that case, when the <td> is closed, the stack would pop the 'td', leaving 'tr' and 'table'. Then, if there's another <td> in the same tr, that would again be added.

So, whenever a <td> is opened, the parent must be a <tr>, and that <tr>'s parent must be the current table (the topmost table in the stack). So, in that case, the current table's counter is incremented.

But how to track that. Let's think of the stack as a list of tags. Each time a new tag is opened, it's pushed onto the stack. When closed, popped.

So, when a <td> is opened (i.e., we process a <td> tag), we check the stack:

- The previous tag (the one immediately before the current <td> in the stack) must be a <tr>.
- And that <tr>'s parent must be a <table> (the current table).

So, for example, if the stack before opening the <td> is [ 'table', 'tr' ], then adding the td would make it [ 'table', 'tr', 'td' ], and this td is part of the current table (the topmost table in the stack). So the current table's counter is incremented.

But if the stack is like [ 'table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr' ], and then a <td> is opened here, then that's part of the inner table. So when processing that <td>, we check the stack: the parent is tr, which is part of the inner table. So the inner table's counter is incremented.

But how to track which table is the current one. The stack of tables is separate. So, perhaps we need to track two things:

1. A stack for the current tag hierarchy (to check if a td is inside a tr inside a table)
2. A separate stack for the current tables' counters.

So, for each tag, when processing:

- If the tag is <table>, push a new counter (0) onto the tables stack. Also push the tag onto the general stack.
- If the tag is </table>, pop from the tables stack, save the count, and pop the tag from the general stack.
- For <td> tags, when opened, check if the parent is a <tr> and the grandparent is a <table> (the current table). If so, increment the current table's counter (the top of the tables stack).

Wait, but how to check the parent and grandparent. For example, the general stack would track all open tags. So, when processing an opening <td> tag, after pushing it to the stack, the stack would look like [ ..., 'tr', 'td' ]. So, the previous two elements would be 'tr' and then the table's tags.

Wait, no. Let's say we have:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

So, when processing the inner <td> (the one inside the inner table), the stack when opening this <td> would be:

[ 'table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr', 'td' ]

Wait, no. Let's walk through the steps:

1. Open outer table: tables stack becomes [0], general stack [ 'table' ].
2. Open tr: general stack [ 'table', 'tr' ].
3. Open td: general stack [ 'table', 'tr', 'td' ]. Check if parent is tr and grandparent is table. Yes, so increment tables stack top (outer table's counter) to 1.
4. Open inner table: tables stack becomes [0, 1], general stack [ 'table', 'tr', 'td', 'table' ].
5. Open inner tr: general stack [ 'table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr' ].
6. Open inner td: check parent is tr (yes), grandparent is table (the inner one). So increment the top of tables stack (the inner table's counter) to 1. So now tables stack is [0, 1+1=2? Wait, no. Wait, when the inner table is pushed, the tables stack has 0 (for the inner table) and then 1 (outer). When the inner td is opened, the grandparent is the inner table's tr, which is part of the inner table. So the current table is the inner one (top of tables stack is 0), so the 0 is incremented by 1. So the inner table's counter becomes 1, the outer remains 1.

So, in this example, the outer table has 1 cell, the inner table has 1 cell. Output would be 1 1 sorted, which is 1 1.

So, the logic is: whenever a <td> tag is opened, check if the previous two tags in the general stack are <tr> followed by <table>. But wait, the general stack is a list of tags in order. So when you open a new tag, you push to the stack. So when processing the opening <td> tag, the stack before pushing is [ ... , 'tr' ]. After pushing, it's [ ... , 'tr', 'td' ]. So, to check the parent and grandparent, before pushing, the last element is 'tr', and the one before that is 'table' (if the current table is the one being considered). Wait, no. Because the parent of the tr is the table. So the structure is table -> tr -> td. So when the td is opened, the general stack after pushing will have the td as the last element, and before that is tr, then table. So to check the parent and grandparent, we look at the elements before the current td (i.e., the stack before adding td is [ ... , 'table', 'tr' ]), then when td is added, the last element is td. So, to check that the td is inside a tr and a table, the parent (after opening) is tr, and the grandparent is table.

But in the case of nested tables, like the inner table's td, the stack would be:

After opening outer table, tr, td, inner table, tr, and then inner td.

So the stack when processing the inner td is:

['table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr', 'td']

So the parent is 'tr', grandparent is 'table' (the inner one). So that's correct.

So, the approach is: when processing an opening <td> tag, check if the previous two tags (before adding the td) are 'tr' and 'table'. Wait, no. Because the order in the stack would be after adding the td, the parents are tr (parent) and table (grandparent). So before adding the td, the stack's last element is tr. So after adding the td, the last two elements are tr and td. Wait, no. The stack is processed as follows:

For example, when we process a <tr> tag:

Current stack: ['table']

Push 'tr' → stack becomes ['table', 'tr'].

Then, process a <td> tag. Push 'td' → ['table', 'tr', 'td'].

At this point, when the <td> is opened, the parent is tr, and the grandparent is table. So, we can check that the previous two elements (before the td) are 'tr' and 'table'?

Wait, when the td is opened, the stack before pushing would have 'table', 'tr'. Then, after pushing, 'td' is added. So, to check the parents, we look at the stack before the push. So, the last two elements before pushing are 'tr' and then 'table'? Or is the stack in the order of the parents?

Wait, the stack represents the hierarchy. The first element is the outermost tag. So, for example:

When we have:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The stack during processing would be:

After <table>: ['table']

After <tr>: ['table', 'tr']

After <td>: ['table', 'tr', 'td']

So, the parent of the td is the tr, and the grandparent is the table.

So, when processing the opening <td> tag, after pushing it to the stack, the previous two elements are 'tr' and 'table'. So, the code can check the stack for the presence of 'tr' and 'table' in the positions before.

But how to do this in code. Let's think: when we process an opening tag (like <td>), after pushing it into the stack, we check if the stack has at least two elements before it. So, the stack must be at least length 2. Then, the parent is stack[-2], which is the previous tag. But in the example above, after pushing td, stack[-2] is 'tr', and stack[-3] is 'table'.

Wait, stack[-1] is 'td', stack[-2] is 'tr', stack[-3] is 'table'. So, when processing a td, the grandparent is stack[-3], which is the table.

But how to ensure that the td is part of a tr that is part of the current table. Because, the current table is the top of the tables stack. So, perhaps, whenever a td is opened, and the parent is tr and the grandparent is a table (any table?), then the current table (the top of the tables stack) is the one whose counter should be incremented. Wait, no. Because in the case of a nested table, the grandparent would be the inner table, not the outer one.

So, the code would need to check that the grandparent is the same as the current table. But how to model that.

Alternatively, the stack of tables is a separate structure. Each time a table is opened, a new counter is pushed. The tables stack represents the nesting of tables. The current table is the top of this stack.

So, when a <td> is opened, the code needs to check if the current tag's hierarchy is table (current) → tr → td. Because the current table is the one that is being processed (the top of the tables stack), and the td's parent is a tr that belongs to this table.

But how to ensure that the tr is part of the current table. Because the tr could be part of a nested table. For example:

Current tables stack: [inner_table_counter, outer_table_counter]

Wait, no. Wait, the tables stack is pushed when a <table> is opened. So the order is:

outer table is pushed first, then inner.

So when processing the inner table's td, the current table is the inner one. The code would check that the td is part of a tr that's part of the inner table.

So, to check that the tr is part of the current table, the code must check that the grandparent of the td (the table) is the same as the current table.

But how to track that. Because the grandparent could be any table in the hierarchy.

Alternatively, the code can check that the grandparent is a table (any table) and that the current table (the top of the tables stack) is that grandparent.

Wait, for example:

In the inner table's td case, the grandparent (stack[-3]) is the inner table's tag. The current table in the tables stack is the inner table's counter. So, the code can check that the grandparent is a table (which it is), and that the current table's stack is not empty (which it is). So, whenever a td is opened, and the grandparent is a table (regardless of which one), then the current table (the top of the tables stack) is the one that should have its counter incremented. But how?

Wait, no. Because the current table is the top of the tables stack, which is the most recently opened table. So, when the inner td is opened, the current table is the inner one. So, the code should increment the inner table's counter.

But the grandparent (the table tag) is the inner table. So, perhaps the code can check that the grandparent is a table, and the parent is a tr. Then, since the current table is the top of the tables stack, which is the same as the grandparent (the table that is the grandparent of the td), the code can increment the top of the tables stack.

Wait, but how to get the grandparent. For example, when processing the opening of a td tag, the stack after pushing would be:

... , 'table', 'tr', 'td'

So, the stack indices are:

stack[-3] = 'table' (grandparent)
stack[-2] = 'tr' (parent)
stack[-1] = 'td' (current)

So, when a td is opened, if the parent is tr and the grandparent is table, then the code should increment the current table's counter. Because the current table is the one that corresponds to the grandparent (the table tag). Wait, no. Because the current table is the one that was pushed when the <table> tag was opened, which is the same as the grandparent in this case.

Wait, the tables stack is pushed when a <table> is opened. So, for the grandparent (the 'table' tag in the general stack), the corresponding counter is the one that is currently the top of the tables stack? Or not.

No. For example, in the case of nested tables:

Outer table is opened, counter pushed (counter1). Then, inside it, a tr is opened. Then a td is opened, which increments counter1. Then, inside that td, a <table> is opened (counter2 is pushed). Then, a tr is opened, and a td is opened. When that td is opened, the stack is:

['table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr', 'td']

The grandparent here is the 'table' (the inner one), which is counter2. So the code should increment counter2's count.

But how to connect the general stack's 'table' tag (the inner one) with the tables stack's counter2.

Ah, the general stack's 'table' tags are just the tags. The tables stack is a separate stack that tracks the counters for each table. Each time a <table> tag is opened, a new counter is pushed to the tables stack. When </table> is encountered, the counter is popped and added to the results.

So, when processing a <td> opening tag, the code checks if the parent is 'tr' and grandparent is 'table' (i.e., the last two tags before the td are tr and table). If so, then the current table (top of the tables stack) is the one whose counter is incremented. But why?

Because when the td is part of a tr and a table (the grandparent), that table is the current table (since the table is pushed when opened). Wait, but in the case of nested tables, the grandparent could be a different table. Like, the inner table's td would have the inner table as the grandparent. So when that td is opened, the current table (top of tables stack) is the inner one, which is correct.

So the logic is: whenever a <td> is opened, check if the parent is a <tr> and the grandparent is a <table>. If yes, then the current table (the top of the tables stack) must be that grandparent's table. Therefore, we can increment the current table's counter.

But how does the code make sure that the grandparent is the current table's tag?

Wait, perhaps the code doesn't need to. Because the tables stack is pushed when a <table> tag is opened, so the top of the tables stack corresponds to the innermost table. When the code is processing a td opening, the grandparent (if it's a table) is the same as the top of the tables stack. Because the innermost table's tag would be the last one processed.

Wait, no. For example:

In the nested case, the inner table's opening is processed, which pushes a new counter to the tables stack. Then, when the inner tr and td are processed, the code checks if the grandparent is a table. But the grandparent here is the inner table's tag, which is the same as the top of the tables stack. So, when the code increments the top of the tables stack, that's correct.

So, the code can proceed as:

Whenever a <td> tag is opened, check if the stack has at least three elements (so that the grandparent exists). Then, check if the parent is 'tr' (stack[-2]) and the grandparent is 'table' (stack[-3]). If so, then increment the top of the tables stack by 1.

This seems correct.

So the steps for the code are:

1. Read all input lines, concatenate into a single string s.

2. Split s into the list of tags. Each tag is either an opening or closing tag, like '<table>', '</td>', etc. Note that the input has no spaces, so the tags are consecutive.

3. Process each tag in order.

4. For each tag:

   a. If it's an opening tag (starts with '<' but not '</'):

      - If the tag is '<table>', push a new counter (0) onto the tables stack.

      - Push the tag name (without <>) onto the general stack.

   b. If it's a closing tag (starts with '</'):

      - Pop the general stack (since the tag is closed).

      - If the tag is '</table>', pop the tables stack's top counter and add to the results list.

5. For each opening tag of <td>:

   - After pushing to the general stack, check if the previous two elements (stack[-2] and stack[-3]) are 'tr' and 'table'.

   - If yes, then increment the top of the tables stack by 1.

So, the code will:

- Split the input into tags.

- Iterate through the tags.

- Use two stacks: one for the general tags (to track hierarchy), and one for the tables (counters).

- When a td is opened, check the parent and grandparent.

Now, the code must split the input into the tags. How to do that.

The input is a string like "<table><tr><td></td></tr></table>". So, the tags are delimited by '<' and '>'. So, the code can split the string into tokens between '<' and '>'.

For example, splitting the string on '<' gives parts like '', 'table>', 'tr>', etc. Then, each part (except the first) is split into 'tag>'.

Wait, perhaps the code can split the entire string into a list of tags by splitting on '<' and '>'.

Alternatively, use a regular expression to find all tags. For example, the pattern would be '<[^>]+>', which matches any substring starting with '<', followed by one or more non-'>' characters, then '>'.

So, using re.findall(r'<[^>]+>', s) would give all the tags as a list.

Each tag can then be processed to get their name (e.g., 'table', '/table', 'td', etc.).

So, for each tag in the list:

If the tag starts with '</', it's a closing tag. The name is the part after '</' and before '>'.

If the tag starts with '<', but not '</', it's an opening tag. The name is the part after '<' and before '>'.

So, for example:

- '<table>' → name 'table' (opening)
- '</td>' → name 'td' (closing)
- etc.

So, the code can process each tag accordingly.

So, putting this all together:

The code will:

1. Read all lines, concatenate into a single string s.

2. Use re.findall to extract all tags.

3. Initialize two stacks: tag_stack (for general tags), table_stack (for counters), and a results list.

4. For each tag in tags:

   a. If it's a closing tag:

      i. Check if it's </table>:

         - If yes, pop the top of the table_stack and append to results.

      ii. Pop the tag_stack.

   b. Else (opening tag):

      i. If the tag is 'table':

         - Push 0 to table_stack.

      ii. Push the tag name to tag_stack.

      iii. If the tag is 'td':

          - Check if the tag_stack has at least 3 elements.

          - Check if tag_stack[-2] == 'tr' and tag_stack[-3] == 'table'.

          - If yes, increment the top of table_stack by 1.

So, the key part is after pushing the 'td' to the tag_stack, check if the previous two elements are 'tr' and 'table'. Because the td is now in the stack, so the current stack is ... , 'table', 'tr', 'td'.

Thus, stack[-3] is 'table', stack[-2] is 'tr', stack[-1] is 'td'.

So, after pushing 'td' to the stack, we check if len(tag_stack) >=3 and the previous two are tr and table.

Yes. So, in code:

if tag == 'td':

    if len(tag_stack) >=3 and tag_stack[-2] == 'tr' and tag_stack[-3] == 'table':

        table_stack[-1] +=1

That's correct.

So, in code:

for tag in tags:

    # process each tag

    if tag starts with '</':

        name = tag[2:-1]

        if name == 'table':

            # pop from table_stack and add to results

            if table_stack:

                results.append(table_stack.pop())

        # pop from tag_stack

        if tag_stack:

            tag_stack.pop()

    else:

        name = tag[1:-1]

        if name == 'table':

            table_stack.append(0)

        tag_stack.append(name)

        if name == 'td':

            if len(tag_stack) >=3 and tag_stack[-2] == 'tr' and tag_stack[-3] == 'table':

                if table_stack:

                    table_stack[-1] +=1

So, that's the plan.

Now, let's test this logic with the examples.

First example:

Input: <table><tr><td></td></tr></table>

Tags are:

['<table>', '<tr>', '<td>', '</td>', '</tr>', '</table>']

Processing:

- <table> → push to tag_stack ['table'], push 0 to table_stack [0].

- <tr> → push to tag_stack ['table', 'tr'].

- <td> → push to tag_stack ['table', 'tr', 'td']. Check if len >=3 (yes), and -2 is 'tr', -3 is 'table'. So increment table_stack[-1] (0 → 1).

- </td> → pop tag_stack → ['table', 'tr'].

- </tr> → pop → ['table'].

- </table> → pop tag_stack (empty). Pop table_stack (0 → added to results. results is [1].

Output is 1. Correct.

Second example:

The input after concatenation is a single string that's the combination of all lines. The inner table has 4 cells.

Let's see. The inner table has two trs? Or more.

Looking at the sample input 2:

The inner table has:

<tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr>

So four trs, each with one td. So 4 cells.

The outer table has one tr and one td. So 1 cell.

So output is 1 4, sorted as 1 4.

Processing:

Outer table is opened → table_stack [0].

Then tr → pushed.

Then td → pushed. Check: len >=3? tag_stack after pushing is ['table', 'tr', 'td'], so check -2 is 'tr', -3 'table'. So increment table_stack [0 → 1].

Then, inside the td, a new table is opened → table_stack becomes [0, 1]. tag_stack: ['table', 'tr', 'td', 'table'].

Then, process tr → pushed → tag_stack ... 'tr'.

td → pushed → check len >=3: after pushing, stack is ['table', 'tr', 'td', 'table', 'tr', 'td'].

Check -2 is 'tr', -3 is 'table' → yes. So increment table_stack[-1] (0 → 1).

Then, the closing tags come, etc.

In the end, the inner table's counter is 4, outer is 1.

The results list is [4, 1], but when popped, they are added in order. So the code appends in the order of closing. So when the inner table is closed first, its counter is added first. Then the outer table's counter is added next.

So, the results list is [4, 1], and when sorted, it's 1 4. Which is correct.

So, the code correctly appends the inner table's counter first, then the outer. Then, sorted, gives the correct output.

So, the code will collect the results in the order of closing the tables (innermost first), then reverse the list? No. Because when you open tables, the stack for tables is [outer, inner]. When closing the inner, the inner is popped and added to results. Then, when the outer is closed, popped and added. So the results list would have [4, 1], and sorted gives 1 4.

Yes. So in the sample input 2, the output is 1 4.

Third example:

The output is 1 1 1 3. Let's see.

The innermost table has a tr with two tds, then a tr with one td. So total 3 cells.

The tables are nested four deep. So when each table is closed, their counts are added to the results in reverse order. The innermost is first, then the next, etc. So the results list would be [3, 1, 1, 1]. Then sorted, 1 1 1 3.

But according to the sample output, it's 1 1 1 3. So the code's approach of appending to the results list in the order of closing (inner first) and then sorting gives the correct output.

So the code seems correct.

Now, handling edge cases:

- Tables with multiple tr's and td's.

- Nested tables in different depths.

- Tables that have multiple td's per tr.

All these should be handled correctly.

Now, the code needs to read the input, process all tags, manage the stacks, and output the sorted list.

Now, implement this in Python.

So, code steps:

Read all lines, concatenate into s.

Use re.findall(r'<[^>]+>', s) to get all tags.

Initialize tag_stack = [], table_stack = [], results = [].

Loop through each tag in tags:

   process opening or closing.

For example:

For each tag in tags:

   if tag starts with '</':

       name = tag[2:-1]

       if name == 'table' and table_stack:

           results.append(table_stack.pop())

       # pop from tag_stack

       if tag_stack:

           tag_stack.pop()

   else:

       name = tag[1:-1]

       tag_stack.append(name)

       if name == 'table':

           table_stack.append(0)

       elif name == 'td':

           if len(tag_stack) >=3 and tag_stack[-2] == 'tr' and tag_stack[-3] == 'table' and table_stack:

               table_stack[-1] +=1

After all tags are processed, sort the results and print them space-separated.

Now, code:

import sys
import re

s = ''.join([input().strip() for _ in range(10)]).strip()
tags = re.findall(r'<[^>]+>', s)

tag_stack = []
table_stack = []
results = []

for tag in tags:
    if tag.startswith('</'):
        name = tag[2:-1]
        if name == 'table':
            if table_stack:
                results.append(table_stack.pop())
        if tag_stack:
            tag_stack.pop()
    else:
        name = tag[1:-1]
        tag_stack.append(name)
        if name == 'table':
            table_stack.append(0)
        elif name == 'td':
            if len(tag_stack) >=3 and tag_stack[-2] == 'tr' and tag_stack[-3] == 'table' and table_stack:
                table_stack[-1] += 1

results.sort()
print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

Wait, but in the code above, when a closing tag is processed, the code pops from tag_stack even if it's not the same as the name. But since the input is valid according to the problem statement, the stack is properly formed. So the code can safely pop.

Yes. Because the input is guaranteed to be valid. So the code can process each closing tag by popping the tag_stack once.

Testing with the sample inputs:

Sample 1:

Input is one line: "<table><tr><td></td></tr></table>"

tags = ['<table>', '<tr>', '<td>', '</td>', '</tr>', '</table>']

Processing:

- '<table>': tag_stack ['table'], table_stack [0]

- '<tr>': tag_stack ['table', 'tr']

- '<td>': tag_stack ['table', 'tr', 'td']. Check len >=3, yes. tag_stack[-2] is 'tr', -3 is 'table'. So table_stack[-1] +=1 → 0 → 1.

- '</td>': closing. Pop tag_stack → ['table', 'tr']

- '</tr>': closing. Pop → ['table']

- '</table>': closing. Pop tag_stack (empty). Append table_stack.pop() (0 → but wait, no.

Wait, wait. When processing the closing </table>:

The code checks if name is 'table', then appends the popped value from table_stack. Since the table_stack has [0] (the outer table's counter was pushed as 0, then incremented to 1 when the td was opened).

Wait, no. When the outer table is opened, table_stack is [0]. Then, when the <td> is processed, table_stack[-1] is incremented to 1. Then, when </table> is processed, the code appends table_stack.pop() → which is 1. So results will have [1]. Then sorted is [1]. So code works.

Yes. So code is correct.

Sample 2:

After processing, the results are [4, 1], then sorted gives [1,4].

Sample 3:

The innermost tables are processed first. The results list will have the counts in the order of popping from the table_stack. So for four tables, the first popped is the innermost, then next, etc. So if they have counts 3, 1, 1, 1, the results list will be [3,1,1,1], which when sorted becomes [1,1,1,3]. Which matches the sample.

So the code should work.

Now, checking for possible issues:

What if a td is inside a tr that is inside a table, but the tr is part of a different table (due to some nesting)? But according to the code's logic, the current table's stack's top is the innermost table, and the code checks if the grandparent is a table (which would be the innermost one). So the code correctly increments the innermost table's counter.

Another possible case: a td inside a td. For example:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<td>
</td>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

But according to the grammar, tr contains td's. So this would be invalid. But the problem says the input is valid according to the grammar, so such cases won't exist. The code can assume that the input is well-formed.

So the code is correct.
