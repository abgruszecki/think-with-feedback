Okay, let's see. The problem is to compute (1^n + 2^n + 3^n +4^n) mod 5. And the input n can be super large, like up to 1e10^5, which means it's given as a string. So I need to find a way to compute this without actually calculating those huge exponents.

Hmm, mod 5 here. Oh right, maybe there's a pattern in the exponents modulo something. Like, using Euler's theorem or something. Because for numbers coprime with 5, like 1,2,3,4, we can use Fermat's little theorem. Since 5 is prime, phi(5) is 4. So a^4 â‰¡1 mod5 when a is not divisible by 5. Wait, but 1 is coprime with 5, but 1^anything is 1. So maybe each term's cycle modulo 5 repeats every 4. Let's see.

Wait, let's compute each term mod 5 for different exponents:

For 1^n mod5: always 1.

For 2^n mod5:

2^1=2 mod5=2

2^2=4 mod5=4

2^3=8 mod5=3

2^4=16 mod5=1. Then cycles every 4. So period 4.

Similarly for 3:

3^1=3

3^2=9 mod5=4

3^3=12 mod5=2

3^4=6 mod5=1. So same cycle.

4^n mod5:

4^1=4

4^2=16 mod5=1

4^3=4 mod5=4

4^4=16 mod5=1. So cycle here is 2. So the exponents cycle every 2.

So for each term, their mod5 values depend on n mod their cycle length.

So for 2 and 3, their cycle is 4, so their exponents mod4. For 4's cycle is 2, so mod2.

So the plan is:

Find the value of n mod4 for 2^n and 3^n, and n mod2 for 4^n.

But wait, the problem is that n is a very large number, given as a string. So how do we compute n mod4 and n mod2?

Wait, mod2 is easy. The last digit of n: if it's even, then mod2 is 0, else 1. Similarly mod4 depends on the last two digits of n. Because any number mod4 is equal to the last two digits mod4. For example, 1234 mod4 is 34 mod4 = 2. So yeah.

So for the large n, we can compute n mod4 by taking the last two digits, and then compute mod4.

Wait but if n is 0, then the input is "0". So need to handle that.

Once we have n mod4 (for 2 and 3) and n mod2 (for4), then we can compute each term mod5.

Let's calculate each term:

Term1: 1^n mod5 is always 1.

Term2: 2^(n mod4) mod5. But wait, what if n mod4 is 0? Then 2^4 mod5 is 1. So for example, if n is 4, then 2^4 mod5 is 1.

Term3: 3^(n mod4) mod5.

Term4:4^(n mod2) mod5. Because 4 has a cycle of 2. So if n is even, 4^even mod5 is (4^2)^k mod5=1^k=1. If n is odd, 4^1=4 mod5.

So once we compute these four terms mod5, sum them up and mod5 again.

So the steps are:

1. Read the input n as a string.

2. Compute mod4 and mod2 of n.

   For mod2: if the last digit is even, then 0 else 1.

   For mod4: take the last two digits of n, convert to integer, mod4. If the length is less than 2, then just mod4 the number.

3. For each term:

   a. term1 =1.

   b. term2 = 2^mod4_val, mod5.

   c. term3 =3^mod4_val, mod5.

   d. term4 =4^mod2_val, mod5.

4. Sum all terms and mod5.

Now, let's handle some edge cases. For example, n=0. Then:

Each term is 1^0=1, 2^0=1, 3^0=1, 4^0=1. Sum is 4 mod5 is4. But according to the first example, when n=4, the output is4. Wait, no. Wait the first example's input is 4, which gives (1^4 + 2^4 +3^4 +4^4) mod5. 1+16+81+256 = 354 mod5 is 354/5=70*5=350, remainder 4. So yes, output 4.

But for n=0, sum is (1+1+1+1)=4 mod5=4. So the output is4. So that's correct.

Another example: input is the big number in the second sample. The output is0. Let's see. The sum mod5 is 0. So perhaps the exponents make each term sum to 0 mod5.

So how does that work? Let's see. For the input 124356983594583453458888889, what is mod4 and mod2.

mod2 is determined by the last digit: '9' is odd, mod2 is1.

mod4 is determined by the last two digits: '89'. 89 mod4 is 1 (since 4*22=88, 89-88=1). So mod4 is1.

So:

term1=1.

term2: 2^1 mod5=2.

term3:3^1 mod5=3.

term4:4^1 mod5=4.

Sum is 1+2+3+4=10 mod5=0. So output is0. Which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Now, the steps in code:

First, handle the input string. Need to compute mod4 and mod2.

If the input is '0', then mod4 is0, mod2 is0. Because n=0.

But for mod4, when the number is 0, 0 mod4 is0.

So code steps:

Take the input string s.

If s is '0', then mod4=0, mod2=0.

Else:

mod2 = (int(s[-1]) %2).

mod4: take the last two characters of s. If length >=2, then take s[-2:], else take s.

convert to integer, then mod4.

Now, compute:

term1=1.

term2=pow(2, mod4,5) if mod4 !=0 else 1. Wait, no. Wait, 2^0 mod5 is1. Wait when mod4 is 0, like if the exponent is 4, then 2^4 mod5 is16 mod5=1.

So regardless of mod4, term2 is (2 ** mod4) mod5, but since mod4 can be 0, 1,2,3,4? Wait mod4 is n mod4. So possible values are 0,1,2,3.

Wait, no. Because when we compute mod4, possible values are 0,1,2,3.

Wait for example, n mod4 can be 0 (if n is divisible by4). So 2^0 mod5=1. Which is correct.

So for term2: pow(2, mod4_val,5).

Similarly for term3: pow(3, mod4_val,5).

term4: pow(4, mod2_val,5). Because mod2_val can be 0 or1.

So in code:

sum_mod = (1 + pow(2, mod4,5) + pow(3, mod4,5) + pow(4, mod2,5)) %5

But wait, when mod4 is 0, then 2^0 is 1 mod5.

Yes.

So code steps:

Read s.

Compute mod2 and mod4.

Compute sum mod5.

Then output the sum.

Now, the edge case when s is '0':

n=0. So:

term1:1^0=1.

term2:2^0=1.

term3:3^0=1.

term4:4^0=1.

Sum 4 mod5=4.

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=1.

mod4 is 1, mod2 is1.

term2=2 mod5.

term3=3 mod5.

term4=4 mod5.

sum 1+2+3+4=10 mod5=0. Output is0.

Another test: n=2.

mod4 is 2 mod4=2.

mod2 is0.

term2=2^2=4 mod5.

term3=3^2=9 mod5=4.

term4=4^0=1 mod5.

sum 1+4+4+1=10 mod5=0.

Another test case: n=3.

mod4 is3.

term2=2^3=8 mod5=3.

term3=3^3=27 mod5=2.

term4=4^1=4 mod5.

sum 1+3+2+4=10 mod5=0.

Hmm. So for n=3, sum is0.

So code seems correct.

Now, how to compute mod4?

For example, s is "4" -> mod4 is 4 mod4=0.

s is "5" -> 5 mod4=1.

s is "124356983594583453458888889" -> last two digits '89' mod4 is 1.

So code:

def get_mod(s, m):

    # compute the integer value of s mod m.

    # s is a non-empty string without leading zeros.

    # but for s being "0", returns 0.

    if m ==1:

        return 0

    mod =0

    for c in s:

        mod = (mod *10 + int(c)) %m

    return mod

Wait, but for large m (like up to 1e5), but in this case, m is 4. So it's manageable.

Alternatively, for m=4, which is small, we can process the entire string digit by digit.

But even for large m, this would work, but for the problem, since m is 4, which is small, it's okay.

But in the case of mod4, the code can be optimized.

But for the problem, to compute mod4, perhaps taking the last two digits is sufficient, since any number mod4 is equal to the last two digits mod4.

Yes. Because 100 is divisible by4. So for any number, the last two digits represent the value mod4.

So for example, 1234 -> 34 mod4= 34%4=2. 1234 mod4=1234//4=308*4=1232, 1234-1232=2. So yes.

So the code for mod4 can be:

if len(s) >=2:

    last_two = s[-2:]

else:

    last_two = s

mod4_val = int(last_two) %4

But wait, for numbers like '0' (s is '0'), last_two is '0', mod4 is0.

So that's correct.

But what if the s is '5'? last_two is '5' mod4 is1.

Yes.

So code can be written as:

if s == '0':

    mod4 =0

else:

    if len(s) >=2:

        last_two = s[-2:]

    else:

        last_two = s

    mod4 = int(last_two) %4

Similarly for mod2: s[-1] %2.

So code:

s = input().strip()

if s == '0':

    mod4 =0

else:

    if len(s) >=2:

        mod4 = int(s[-2:]) %4

    else:

        mod4 = int(s) %4

mod2 = int(s[-1]) %2 if s != '0' else 0

Wait, but when s is '0', mod2 is0. So the code above handles that.

Then compute the sum.

sum_val = 1 + pow(2, mod4,5) + pow(3, mod4,5) + pow(4, mod2,5)

result = sum_val %5

print(result)

Wait, but in code:

If mod4 is 0, then pow(2,0,5) is1. Which is correct.

Yes.

So this code should handle all cases.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    if s == '0':
        mod4 = 0
    else:
        mod4 = int(s[-2:]) % 4 if len(s) >= 2 else int(s) % 4
    mod2 = int(s[-1]) % 2 if s != '0' else 0

    sum_val = (1 + pow(2, mod4, 5) + pow(3, mod4, 5) + pow(4, mod2, 5)) % 5
    print(sum_val, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
124356983594583453458888889
""",
            "output": \
"""\
0
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample:

mod4 is1.

mod2 is9 mod2=1.

sum_val=1 + 2^1 (2) +3^1 (3) +4^1 (4). Sum is1+2+3+4=10 mod5=0. Correct.

Another test case where n=5:

n=5. mod4 is5 mod4=1. mod2 is5 mod2=1.

sum_val =1 +2+3+4=10 mod5=0. Output0.

So code seems correct.

Now, handling n=0:

mod4 is0, mod2 is0.

sum is 1 +1 +1 +1=4 mod5=4.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

```python
s = input().strip()

if s == '0':
    mod4 = 0
else:
    mod4 = int(s[-2:]) % 4 if len(s) >= 2 else int(s) % 4
mod2 = int(s[-1]) % 2 if s != '0' else 0

sum_val = (1 + pow(2, mod4, 5) + pow(3, mod4, 5) + pow(4, mod2, 5)) % 5
print(sum_val)
```
