Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So Kate has a set S which is {1, 2, ..., n}. For each k from 2 to n, we need to find the minimal possible imperfection, which is the maximum gcd of any pair in the subset of size k. Our goal is to output all these I_k values.

First, let's think about what the imperfection depends on. The imperfection is the maximum gcd of any two distinct elements in the subset. So to minimize this maximum, we need a subset where all pairs have as small gcd as possible, but the maximum among them is as small as possible.

Let's look at the examples. For n=2, the only subset of size 2 is {1,2}, which gives gcd 1. So I_2 is 1. For n=3, subsets of size 2 can have gcd 1 (like {2,3}) or higher. The subset of size 3 includes all elements, and the maximum gcd is gcd(2,3)=1, so I_3 is 1. So the output is 1 1.

Hmm. So maybe the minimal possible imperfection for a subset of size k is the smallest possible d such that there's a subset of size k where all pairs have gcd <= d, and the maximum among those is d. Wait, but how to find this d?

Let's think about how to construct such subsets. For example, if we take all numbers that are even, then the maximum gcd would be 2. But perhaps there's a way to arrange subsets with higher numbers where the gcd is smaller.

Wait, but in the example for n=3, taking {1,2,3} gives pairs (1,2) gcd 1, (1,3) gcd 1, (2,3) gcd 1. So the maximum is 1. That's ideal.

Another example: n=4. Let's see subsets of size 4. The entire set would have pairs like (2,4) with gcd 2, so the imperfection is 2. But maybe there's a better subset. Wait, no. The subset {1,2,3,4} must include pairs like (2,4), so the maximum gcd is 2. But maybe another subset of size 4? Like {1,3,4,2}—same as the full set. So I_4 would be 2. But wait, is there a subset of size 4 where all pairs have gcd <= 2? Well, in the full set, the maximum is 2. So maybe that's the best possible.

Wait, but what's the answer for n=4? Let's see. For k=2, the minimal imperfection is 1 (like any two consecutive numbers). For k=3, maybe we can take {2,3,4}. The gcd(2,4) is 2, which would make the imperfection 2. But maybe a better subset exists. Wait, take {3,4,5} (but wait, n=4 here). Oh, sorry. For n=4, the possible subsets of size 3. Let's see: {1,2,3} has maximum gcd 1. So I_3 for n=4 is 1. Then for k=4 (subset size 4), the imperfection is 2. So the output would be 1 1 2.

So how to approach this for general n?

Hmm. Let's think about the minimal possible I_k for each k. The minimal possible maximum gcd in a subset of size k.

The key insight here is that the minimal possible I_k for a given k is equal to the smallest integer d such that there are at least k numbers in {1,...,n} that are multiples of some number greater than or equal to d. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the largest possible divisor that can't be avoided when selecting k elements.

Another approach is to realize that the minimal imperfection is determined by the smallest d where the maximum subset that has all elements with gcd <= d has size >=k. So maybe the problem is to find, for each k, the minimal d such that there's a subset of size k where all pairs have gcd <= d, and the maximum of these is d.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal possible imperfection for a subset of size k is equal to the smallest d such that the maximum subset that avoids multiples of any number larger than d has size >=k.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

For a subset M, the imperfection is the maximum gcd(a,b) for a≠b in M. Let's denote this as I(M). Our task is for each k, find the minimal possible I(M) over all subsets of size k.

The minimal possible I(M) for a subset of size k must be the minimal d where there exists a subset of size k where all pairs have gcd ≤ d, and at least one pair has gcd exactly d. Because if there exists a subset with all pairs having gcd ≤ d-1, then the minimal would be d-1. So the minimal d is the smallest such that the subset can be constructed with all pairs' gcds ≤ d, and there's at least one pair with gcd exactly d.

Wait, perhaps the minimal d is the smallest possible maximum gcd that allows a subset of size k. So how to find this for each k?

Let's think about the structure of such subsets. The best way to minimize the maximum gcd is to avoid pairs with high gcd. For example, the minimal maximum is 1 when possible. But when k is so large that you can't avoid pairs with higher gcds.

For instance, when n is even, the maximum subset with all elements being even would have a maximum gcd of at least 2. But if you can select a subset where all elements are coprime, then the maximum gcd would be 1.

So the problem is to find for each k, the smallest possible d such that there's a subset of size k where all elements are in a set that has maximum pairwise gcd d.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach is to realize that the minimal possible imperfection I_k is equal to the minimal d where the maximum subset size possible with all elements being multiples of d, or being multiples of numbers that are coprimes with higher multiples. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the optimal strategy for selecting subsets is to include as many numbers as possible with higher numbers (i.e., larger numbers) to minimize their gcd. Because larger numbers are less likely to have common divisors. For example, including primes. But primes can be even (like 2), but if you have 2 and 4, their gcd is 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal subset is to take the first k numbers. Wait, but that's not the case. For example, when n=4, taking the first 4 numbers (1,2,3,4) has pairs (2,4) with gcd 2. But maybe another subset of size 4 could have a lower maximum gcd. But I don't think so. Because any subset of 4 elements must include at least two even numbers. Because there are two even numbers (2 and 4) in the set. So any subset of 4 elements must include both, leading to a gcd of 2. So the imperfection is 2 for k=4 in n=4.

So the idea is that the minimal possible imperfection depends on the maximum d such that there are enough numbers in the set that are multiples of d. Because if you can find a d where the number of elements in the set that are multiples of d is >=k, then the minimal imperfection can't be lower than d. Wait, perhaps not. For example, if d=2, the numbers 2,4,6, etc., their pairwise gcd is at least 2. So the imperfection for any subset consisting of these numbers would be at least 2. So if there's a subset of size k that is a subset of the even numbers, then the imperfection for that subset is at least 2. But if there exists a subset of size k where all pairs have gcd <=1, then the imperfection is 1, which is better.

So the key is to find the minimal d such that there exists a subset of size k where all elements are in such a way that their pairwise gcds are <=d, and at least one pair has gcd exactly d. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal imperfection I_k is the smallest d where the number of elements in the set that are multiples of d, but not multiples of any larger d' (d' >d), is sufficient to form a subset of size k. Not sure.

Let's think about the problem differently. For each d, find how many numbers in {1,..,n} are multiples of d but not multiples of any multiple of d (i.e., multiples of d but not of 2d, 3d, etc.). These numbers are the numbers exactly divisible by d. Let's denote this count as φ(d). Then, φ(d) is equal to the count of numbers in [1, n] that are divisible by d but not by any multiple of d larger than d. Wait, no. φ(d) is the count of numbers in {d, 2d, ..., md} where d* m ≤n, but such that none of these numbers are divisible by 2d, 3d, etc. So φ(d) is the count of numbers in the set that are exactly divisible by d (i.e., their maximum divisor is d). Wait, not exactly. For example, 6 is divisible by 3, but 6 is also divisible by 2 and 6. So the exact divisors are tricky. Hmm.

Alternatively, φ(d) can be calculated as the count of numbers in [1..n] divisible by d, minus the count of numbers divisible by 2d, 3d, etc. So φ(d) = floor(n/d) - floor(n/(2d)) - floor(n/(3d)) - ... but that's not exactly right. Wait, no. The inclusion-exclusion principle would require that. Wait, φ(d) is the Möbius function applied here. So φ(d) = sum_{k=1 to ∞} μ(k) * floor(n/(d*k))). But since d*k can't exceed n, this sum is finite. But perhaps this is getting too mathematical.

Alternatively, for a given d, the numbers in the set S that are multiples of d but not multiples of any multiple of d greater than d. So for example, for d=2, numbers like 2, 6, 10 (if in range), but not 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 4, which is a multiple of 2). Wait, no. For d=2, numbers that are multiples of 2 but not multiples of 4,6, etc. So numbers that are divisible by 2 but not by any larger even number (like 4, 6, etc.). So 2 is in, 6 is in if 6/2=3 is not even. Wait, 6 is 2*3. So 6 is divisible by 2, but is 6 also divisible by 3 (which is a multiple of d=2? No, 3 is not a multiple of 2. So maybe this approach is not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers that are exactly divisible by d (i.e., their maximum divisor is d). No, that's not possible. Because any number greater than d must have divisors larger than 1. So the maximum divisor of a number is itself. So this line of thinking isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps for each d, the numbers in S that are divisible by d but not by any prime larger than d. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the smallest integer such that the number of elements in S that are multiples of d is at least k. Because if we can take all multiples of d, then their pairwise gcds are at least d. So the imperfection would be d. But perhaps there's a way to take a subset that includes some multiples of d and others that are not, leading to a lower maximum gcd.

Wait, but the minimal possible I_k is the minimal d where the maximum subset size that can have a maximum pairwise gcd of d is at least k. So for example, if there's a subset of size k where the maximum pairwise gcd is d, and there's no such subset for any d' <d, then d is the minimal I_k.

So how do we find d for each k?

Alternatively, the minimal I_k is the minimal d such that the maximum number of elements you can select with all pairwise gcds ≤d is ≥k. Then, the problem reduces to finding, for each k, the minimal d where this condition holds.

But how do we compute this? The maximum subset size for a given d is the largest possible subset where all elements have pairwise gcd ≤d. We need to find for each k the minimal d where this maximum subset size is ≥k.

But how to compute the maximum subset size for a given d.

Wait, another approach: the maximum subset where all elements are pairwise coprime. For such a subset, the imperfection is 1. The maximum size of such a subset is equal to the count of primes in [1..n] plus 1 (including 1, which is coprime with all). Because 1 can be included in any subset. So if 1 is part of the subset, then all other elements must be coprime with 1 (which they are), and pairwise coprime. So for example, including 1 and all primes up to n would give a subset where the maximum gcd is 1. The size is 1 + π(n), where π(n) is the prime-counting function.

So for k up to π(n)+1, the minimal imperfection is 1. For larger k, we have to include elements that may have a higher gcd.

So for example, when n=4, the primes are 2,3. Including 1,2,3 gives a subset of size 3 with imperfection 1. But when we need a subset of size 4 (k=4), we have to include 4. Then, the subset {1,2,3,4} has pairs (2,4) with gcd 2, so the imperfection is 2.

So the idea is that for k up to the maximum size of a subset with all elements coprimes (including 1), the minimal I_k is 1. Once k exceeds that maximum size, the minimal imperfection increases.

So first, we need to find the maximum possible subset size with all elements coprimes. Let's call this m. Then, for k ≤m, I_k is 1. For k >m, we need to find the next minimal d.

But how to compute m. The maximum subset with all elements coprimes can be formed by including 1 and all primes in S. Because 1 is coprime with all, and primes are pairwise coprime. But primes may have multiples in the set. For example, if n=6, primes are 2,3,5. So including 1,2,3,5 gives a subset of size 4. Then, for k=5, we have to include another element, like 4. Then, the subset would have pairs like (2,4) with gcd 2. So the imperfection is 2.

So the maximum m is 1 + the number of primes between 2 and n. But wait, including 1 is optional. For example, if you exclude 1 and include primes, you can get a subset of primes, which are pairwise coprimes. The size would be π(n). Then, including 1 adds 1 to the size, giving π(n)+1.

So the maximum possible subset size with imperfection 1 is either the number of primes in [2..n] plus 1 (if including 1), or the number of primes plus 1 (since 1 can be added). So m = 1 + π(n).

Wait, but in the case of n=3, π(n) is 2 (primes 2,3). So m=3. So subsets of size up to 3 can have imperfection 1. But when n=3 and k=3, the entire set is allowed and the imperfection is 1. Which matches the example.

So for k up to m, the answer is 1. For k larger than m, the answer depends on the next possible minimal d.

So the next step is to find for each k>m, the minimal d such that there's a subset of size k where the imperfection is d.

But how to compute this. Let's think: once you can't form a subset of size k with all pairs having gcd ≤1, you have to allow at least one pair with higher gcd. The minimal possible d in this case is the minimal d where you can add elements that are multiples of d, but then the maximum gcd becomes d.

So for example, when k exceeds m, the minimal d is the minimal possible maximum of the gcd of any pair in the subset. So perhaps the next minimal d is 2, then 3, etc.

But how to model this.

Another idea: the minimal possible d for k is determined by the minimal d such that the sum of the number of primes up to n (plus 1) plus the number of multiples of d (but not in the primes) is at least k. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the elements in the set S as layers. The first layer is the primes and 1. Then, the next layers are numbers with their smallest prime factor being 2, 3, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem is similar to the problem of scheduling. For each d, we can include all numbers that are multiples of d, but not multiples of any smaller d' (d' <d). Wait, no. Because the minimal d for a number is its minimal prime factor. Hmm.

Alternatively, for each d, the numbers that are exactly divisible by d (i.e., numbers where d is their greatest common divisor with any other number in the subset). But this is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the minimal d for k is the minimal d such that when you take all numbers in S that are multiples of d, and then add as many numbers as possible from the coprimes set, the total is >=k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after the primes and 1 are all included (giving m = 1 + π(n)), the next elements to include are even numbers (since they have gcd 2 with some existing elements). So adding even numbers would set the imperfection to 2. So for k = m+1, the answer is 2.

Wait, but in the example n=4, m=1 + π(4) = 1+2=3. So for k=4, the answer is 2. Which matches.

Another example: n=5. Primes are 2,3,5. So m=1+3=4. For k=5, the minimal d is 2. Because the subset would include 1,2,3,5,4. The pair (2,4) has gcd 2. So the answer is 2.

So for k beyond m, the minimal d starts at 2 and increases as needed. So perhaps the minimal d for k is the smallest d such that the number of elements in S that are multiples of d plus the maximum subset size with pairwise coprimes (m) is at least k. But this is not exactly correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the maximal number of elements that can be added to the coprimes set without increasing the imperfection beyond d is equal to the number of multiples of d in S that are not in the coprimes set (i.e., composite numbers). But this is vague.

Let's think of it as layers. The first layer is the coprimes subset (1 + primes) of size m. The next layers are numbers that are multiples of 2, then multiples of 3, etc. But adding a number from the multiples of 2 will have a gcd of 2 with existing even numbers in the coprimes set (like 2). So the imperfection becomes 2.

But how to model the maximal possible subsets for higher d.

Wait, perhaps once you have to include elements that are multiples of some d, the imperfection becomes d. So for k > m, the minimal possible d is the minimal d where the number of multiples of d (including d itself) in S is >= (k - m). Because you can take the coprimes subset (size m) and add (k-m) elements from the multiples of d, which would introduce pairs with gcd d. But that's not correct, because adding a multiple of d that is also even (if d is even) would have a higher gcd with existing elements.

Alternatively, the approach is to realize that after the coprimes subset, the next elements to add are those that are multiples of 2, then multiples of 3, etc., and each time, the imperfection is determined by the maximum gcd between any pair in the subset. So adding a multiple of 2 would create a pair (2, multiple of 2) with gcd 2. So the imperfection becomes 2. Adding more multiples of 2 would not increase the imperfection beyond 2. So for k between m+1 and m + t, where t is the number of multiples of 2 not in the coprimes subset, the imperfection is 2. Then, when those are exhausted, the next step is to add multiples of 3, leading to an imperfection of 3, etc.

Wait, but how to count these numbers. The coprimes subset includes 1 and primes. The multiples of 2 not in the coprimes subset are the even composite numbers (like 4,6, etc.). So the count is floor(n/2) -1 (since 2 is already in the coprimes subset). So for each d, the number of elements that are multiples of d and not in the coprimes subset (i.e., composite multiples of d) is equal to floor(n/d) - (1 if d is prime else 0). Because if d is prime, then d is already in the coprimes subset. For example, when d=2, the number of multiples is floor(n/2) -1 (since 2 is already counted in the coprimes subset).

So for each d >=2, the number of elements that can be added to the coprimes subset (size m) to get subsets with imperfection d is equal to the count of multiples of d not in the coprimes subset. So for example, d=2, count is floor(n/2) -1. Then, for k from m+1 to m + (floor(n/2)-1), the minimal I_k is 2. Then, for k beyond that, we need to add elements with d=3, etc.

But this approach would require that for each d, we can compute how many elements can be added to the coprimes subset before the imperfection increases. But how to find the order of d's to process.

But how to compute the minimal d for each k.

Another approach: for all k up to m (m=1 + π(n)), the answer is 1. For larger k, the answer for each k is the smallest d such that the sum of (number of multiples of d in S) plus the number of elements in the coprimes subset (m) minus the number of elements already counted in both (i.e., elements in coprimes subset that are multiples of d) is >=k. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, for a given d, the maximum possible subset size that can have imperfection d is m (coprimes) + the number of multiples of d in S that are not primes. Because adding these multiples to the coprimes subset would create pairs with gcd equal to d (if d is a prime) or other factors. Wait, but this depends on d's factors.

This is getting complicated.

Let's try to model this.

Suppose we have the coprimes subset (size m). For each d, the number of elements that can be added to this subset such that the maximum gcd is d. These elements are the multiples of d that are composite (since primes are already in the coprimes subset). But adding them would create pairs where the gcd is d (if d is a divisor of the element and d is in the coprimes subset). For example, adding 4 (which is a multiple of 2) to the coprimes subset (which includes 2) creates a pair (2,4) with gcd 2. So the imperfection becomes 2. Similarly, adding 6 (multiple of 2) would also create pairs with gcd 2. So when adding elements that are multiples of d and d is in the coprimes subset (like 2 is a prime), the imperfection for the new subset is d.

So for each d that is a prime (since those are in the coprimes subset), the number of elements that can be added is the number of multiples of d greater than d (since d is already in the coprimes subset). For example, for d=2, the multiples are 4,6,8,..., up to n. So the count is floor(n/d) -1 (subtract 1 for d itself). So for d=2, count is floor(n/2) -1.

So the strategy is: for each prime d, the number of elements that can be added to the coprimes subset (without overlapping) is (floor(n/d) -1). For each composite d, the number of elements that can be added is floor(n/d) minus the number of primes in d's multiples.

But perhaps this is not the right approach. Maybe for composite d, the elements that are multiples of d may already be included in the coprimes subset if d has a prime divisor. For example, d=4. The multiples are 4,8, etc. Adding 4 to the coprimes subset would create pairs like (2,4) which have gcd 2. So the imperfection would be 2, not 4. So in this case, adding multiples of 4 would not contribute to the imperfection being 4. So perhaps the minimal d for these elements is the minimal prime divisor of d.

So for any composite d, the elements that are multiples of d would have their minimal d' (the minimal prime divisor of d). Thus, adding them would contribute to the count for d' instead of d.

Thus, the key insight is that the minimal d for a given element x is the smallest prime divisor of x. Because adding x to the coprimes subset will create a pair (p, x), where p is the smallest prime divisor of x, resulting in a gcd of p.

So, the elements not in the coprimes subset (i.e., composites) are grouped by their smallest prime divisor. For example, 4's smallest prime divisor is 2, so it's grouped under d=2. 6's smallest prime divisor is 2 (if even) or 3 (if odd). Since 6 is even, it's grouped under d=2. 9's smallest is 3. 15's smallest is 3, etc.

So, for each prime p, the number of elements that can be added under d=p is the count of multiples of p that are not primes (since primes are already in the coprimes subset) and have p as their smallest prime divisor.

Wait, but how to compute that. For example, for p=2, the numbers are even composites. For p=3, the numbers are multiples of 3 that are not divisible by 2 (since if divisible by 2, their minimal prime divisor is 2). So for p=3, the numbers are multiples of 3 in the form 3*(2k+1), i.e., odd multiples of 3.

So for a prime p, the count of numbers in [1..n] that are multiples of p, not in the coprimes subset (i.e., composite), and not divisible by any prime smaller than p. So this count is equal to the number of multiples of p in [1..n] that are not divisible by any prime less than p. These numbers are of the form p * m, where m is a number >=2 and all primes dividing m are >=p.

So for p=2, the count is the number of even composites in [1..n]. But since even composites are all multiples of 2, and the primes are excluded (since 2 is the only even prime). So the count is floor(n/2) -1 (since 2 is in the coprimes subset and the other even numbers are composites).

For p=3, the count is the number of multiples of 3 in [1..n] that are not even. So multiples of 3 that are odd. For example, 3*1=3 (prime, in coprimes subset), 3*3=9 (composite, not divisible by 2), 3*5=15, etc. So the count is floor(n/3) minus the number of even multiples of 3 (which is floor(n/(2*3))). But wait, this isn't quite right. Because for p=3, the numbers we want are multiples of 3 that are not divisible by 2. So they are multiples of 3 but not of 2. So the count is the number of multiples of 3 in [1..n] minus the number of multiples of 6 (3*2) in [1..n]. So for p=3, the count is floor(n/3) - floor(n/(2*3)).

But also, we need to subtract 1 if 3 is a prime (since 3 is already in the coprimes subset). So for p=3, the count is (floor(n/3) -1) - floor(n/(2*3)). Wait, 3 is in the coprimes subset. So the multiples of 3 are 3,6,9,12,... So the composites are 6,9,12, etc. But among these, the ones not divisible by 2 are 9,15, etc. So the count is floor(n/(3)) -1 (excluding 3) minus the number of even multiples of 3. The even multiples of 3 are multiples of 6, which is 3*2. So the count is (floor(n/3) -1) - (floor(n/6)).

So for prime p, the count is:

count_p = (floor(n/p) -1) - sum_{q < p, q is prime} floor(n/(p*q)) )

But this seems computationally expensive for large p. However, perhaps there's a way to compute this for all primes up to n.

But given the constraints (n up to 5e5), we need an efficient way to compute this.

Alternatively, for each prime p, the count of numbers x in [1..n] where the smallest prime divisor of x is p. This is exactly the numbers in the sieve of Eratosthenes that are marked as composite and have p as their smallest prime.

So the count for each prime p is equal to the number of multiples of p in [2..n] that are not multiples of any prime smaller than p.

So for example:

- For p=2, the count is the number of even composites, which is floor(n/2) -1 (since 2 is a prime and is already in the coprimes subset).
- For p=3, the count is numbers divisible by 3 but not by 2. So floor(n/3) - (number of multiples of 3 that are even). The number of multiples of 3 that are even is floor(n/6). So the count is floor(n/3) - floor(n/6) -1 (since 3 is a prime and is already counted in the coprimes subset).

Wait, but 3 is in the coprimes subset, so we subtract 1. Then, the remaining multiples are 6,9, etc. But 6 is even, so it's excluded. So for multiples of 3 that are odd, like 9,15, etc. So count is (floor(n/3) -1) - floor(n/(3*2))).

So, the formula for count_p is:

count_p = (floor(n/p) -1) - sum_{q is prime < p} floor(n/(p*q)) )

But how to compute this efficiently?

This seems complicated for large primes, but perhaps we can precompute the counts for each prime using sieve methods.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each prime p, the count of numbers in [2..n] that have p as their smallest prime factor. Then, subtract 1 if p is a prime (since p is already in the coprimes subset) to get the count of composites that can be added under d=p.

But this count is exactly the count of numbers with smallest prime factor p. For example, for p=2, this count is the number of even numbers >=4 (since 2 is the smallest prime factor). For p=3, it's numbers divisible by 3 but not by 2 (like 3*3=9, 3*5=15, etc.), and so on.

The count for each p is the number of numbers in the range [p^2, n] that are multiples of p but not divisible by any smaller primes. This can be computed using inclusion-exclusion, but for large n, this might be computationally expensive.

However, the sieve of Eratosthenes can help here. When we perform the sieve, for each number x, we can record its smallest prime factor (spf). Then, for each prime p, the count of numbers x in [2..n] where spf[x] =p is the number of multiples of p that are not divisible by any smaller primes.

So using sieve of Eratosthenes, we can compute an array spf where spf[x] is the smallest prime factor of x. Then, for each prime p, iterate through all x where spf[x] =p. This gives the count for each p.

Once we have this count, then for each prime p, the count_p is the count of x in [2..n] with spf[x] =p. But since the coprimes subset already includes p, the count of numbers that can be added under d=p is (count_p -1) if p is in the coprimes subset. Wait, no. Because the coprimes subset includes all primes. So for the primes p, the count_p is the number of multiples of p that are not primes (since primes are in the coprimes subset). But how to compute this.

Wait, the count_p (as computed by the sieve) is the number of numbers x in [2..n] where the smallest prime factor is p. These x are composite numbers. Because primes have their spf as themselves. So for x composite, spf[x] is the smallest prime divisor.

So for example, x=4: spf[4] =2. x=6: spf[6]=2. x=9: spf=3.

So for each prime p, count_p is the number of composite numbers x in [2..n] with spf[x] =p. So this is exactly the number of composite numbers that can be added to the coprimes subset, which when added will introduce a pair with gcd p.

Thus, the count_p for each prime p is the number of composite numbers x in [2..n] where the smallest prime factor is p. So for each prime p, the count_p can be computed as the number of x in [2..n] where spf[x] =p.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the maximum subset size m with imperfection 1. This is 1 + the number of primes in [2..n]. So m = 1 + π(n).

2. For each prime p, compute the count_p (number of composite numbers with spf =p). Then, the available counts for each d=p are count_p. The minimal imperfection for these numbers is d=p.

3. We need to process the primes in increasing order. For example, adding all numbers with spf=2 first (d=2), then spf=3 (d=3), etc. Because when you add numbers from spf=2, the imperfection becomes 2. When you add numbers from spf=3, the imperfection is 3. So to minimize I_k, we want to add as many numbers as possible from the smallest primes first.

4. So the order is primes sorted in increasing order. For each prime p in this order, the count_p numbers can be added, each contributing to the imperfection d=p.

5. Once all numbers from spf=2 are added (count_2 elements), then we add numbers from spf=3, and so on.

So the total sequence for the answer is:

For k up to m: I_k=1.

For k from m+1 to m + sum(count_p for p in primes sorted in increasing order, in order of p): the I_k is p, where p is the current prime being processed.

So the steps are:

- Compute the sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes up to n and compute spf for each number.

- Compute m = 1 + the number of primes in [2..n].

- For each prime p (sorted in increasing order), compute count_p = number of x in [2..n] where spf[x] ==p. These are the composite numbers with smallest prime factor p.

- Generate a list of tuples (p, count_p) sorted by p in increasing order.

- Then, the answer for each k is determined by:

   - If k <=m: output 1.

   - Else, subtract m from k and iterate through the primes in order, subtracting count_p from the remaining k until the remaining is <=0. The corresponding p is the answer for that k.

- For the output, each k beyond m has an answer of the current p being considered.

So the code will need to:

1. Compute all primes up to n using sieve.

2. Compute the count_p for each prime p (number of composites with spf p).

3. Generate a list of primes sorted in increasing order, along with their count_p.

4. For each k from 2 to n:

   a. If k <=m: I_k=1.

   b. Else: compute the minimal p such that the sum of counts of primes up to p is >= (k -m). The I_k is p.

But since the counts are processed in order of increasing p, we can precompute a prefix sum array, and for each k, find the smallest index in the prefix sum where the sum is >= (k -m). The corresponding p is the answer.

But wait, the sum of the counts for primes up to p is the total number of elements that can be added in order. So for example, after processing all primes up to p, we have added sum(count_p) elements. So the minimal p for a particular k is the first p where the prefix sum is >= (k -m).

This is a classic problem of finding the minimal p such that the prefix sum up to p is >= (k -m). So, for example, if the prefix sum array is [a_2, a_2 +a_3, a_2 +a_3 +a_5, ...], then for a given s =k -m, find the first index where the sum >= s.

But how to handle this efficiently for multiple k values.

The approach is:

- Precompute the list of primes sorted in increasing order (excluding 1, which is not a prime).

- For each prime in this list, compute count_p.

- Compute the prefix sum array of these count_p values.

- For each k in [2..n], compute s =k -m. If s <=0, I_k=1. Else, find the smallest index i such that the prefix sum up to i is >=s. The p is primes[i].

But how to compute this for all k from m+1 to n.

The code would need to generate for each k from 2 to n:

if k <=m: output 1

else:

   s =k -m

   find the smallest p in the primes list (sorted) such that the cumulative sum up to p is >=s.

So, the steps are:

Compute sieve to get spf and primes.

Compute count_p for each prime p.

Sort primes in increasing order.

Compute a list of counts in the order of primes.

Compute the prefix sums of this list.

Then, for each k from 2 to n:

if k <=m: answer is 1

else:

s =k -m

binary search the prefix sum array to find the smallest index where the sum is >=s.

The answer is the prime at that index.

Now, let's think about the sieve.

Implementing sieve of Eratosthenes for n up to 5e5 is feasible. The sieve will give us the spf (smallest prime factor) for each number up to n. Then, for each composite number x, we can check its spf. For each prime p, count how many x in [2..n] have spf[x] =p.

So in code:

Compute sieve to get spf array.

Then, for each x from 2 to n:

if x is prime (spf[x] ==x), then it's part of the coprimes subset (m =1 + number of primes).

else:

   p = spf[x]

   increment count_p by 1.

Once we have the count_p for all primes p, we process the primes in increasing order.

Then, compute the prefix sums of the count_p list.

The code outline is:

Read n.

Compute sieve up to n.

Compute primes list (sorted).

Compute m = 1 + len(primes).

Compute count_p for each prime p.

Sort primes in increasing order.

Create a list of counts in the order of primes.

Compute prefix sums.

For each k from 2 to n:

   if k <=m: answer 1

   else:

      s =k -m

      find the smallest index where prefix_sum[i] >=s.

      answer primes[i]

But how to handle the case where the sum of all counts is less than (n -m). Because there may be a case where even after adding all possible composite numbers, the sum of counts is less than (n -m). In that case, the remaining k's would require higher d. Wait, but according to the problem statement, we can form subsets of size k for all k up to n. So this suggests that the sum of counts for all primes p is (n -m), since the coprimes subset has size m, and the remaining (n -m) elements are composites. So the sum of count_p for all primes p is equal to the number of composite numbers in [2..n].

But number of composite numbers in [2..n] is (n-1) - len(primes). So the sum of count_p for all primes p is (n-1 - len(primes)).

But m = 1 + len(primes). So n -m =n-1 - len(primes). Which is exactly the sum of count_p's. So for any k <=m + sum(count_p), which is m + (n-1 - len(primes)) )= m +n-1 - len(primes) = (1+ len(primes)) +n-1 - len(primes) =n. So for k up to n, s =k -m can be up to (n -m) =n - (1 + len(primes)).

But sum(count_p) =n -m.

So for all k from m+1 to n, s will be <= sum(count_p).

Thus, the binary search will always find a solution.

Now, let's test this approach with the examples.

Example 1: n=2.

Primes in [2..2] is [2]. So len(primes) =1. m=1+1=2.

For k=2: it's <=m, so answer is 1.

Which matches the first example.

Example 2: n=3.

Primes are [2,3]. len=2. m=3.

For k=2 and 3:

k=2: <=3 →1.

k=3: <=3 →1.

Output is 1 1.

Which matches the example.

Another example: n=4.

Primes are [2,3]. len=2. m=3.

The composites are 4. So count_p for 2 is 1 (since spf[4]=2). For 3, count_p is 0.

So the primes list sorted is [2,3].

The counts are [1,0]. prefix_sum is [1,1].

For k=4 (s=1), the prefix_sum[0] =1 >=1. So answer is 2.

So output is 1 1 2.

Another example: n=5.

Primes are 2,3,5. m=4.

Composites are 4 (spf=2), 6 (not in n=5).

So count_p for 2 is 1 (only 4), 3:0,5:0.

For k=4: answer 1.

k=5: s=1. prefix_sum[0] is 1 >=1 →2. So output is 2.

The output would be 1 1 2 2.

So the code works.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

In Python, for sieve up to 5e5, it's manageable.

Steps:

1. Generate sieve and spf array.

Initialize spf as list of size n+1, where spf[i] is the smallest prime factor of i.

primes = list to store primes.

Initialize spf[i] =0 for all i. Then, for i from 2 to n:

   if spf[i] is 0:

      spf[i] =i

      primes.append(i)

      for j in i*i to n, step i:

          if spf[j] ==0:

              spf[j] =i

This is the sieve of Eratosthenes.

But this code might not correctly compute spf for all numbers. Let me think. The standard sieve for spf:

Initialize spf as array of size n+1, initialized to 0.

for i from 2 to n:

    if spf[i] ==0:  # i is prime

        spf[i] =i

        for j in i*2 to n step i:

            if spf[j] ==0:

                spf[j] =i

    else:

        continue

This way, for each composite j, the spf[j] is the smallest prime factor.

So yes, this should correctly compute the spf array.

Once spf array is generated, the primes list is the list of i where spf[i] ==i.

Then, for each composite x (spf[x] !=x), we increment count_p for p=spf[x].

So code:

count = defaultdict(int)

for x in range(2, n+1):

    if spf[x] !=x:

        count[spf[x]] +=1

Then, the primes list sorted in increasing order (which they already are if we collected them in order).

Then, create a list of counts for each prime in the primes list:

count_list = [count[p] for p in primes]

But for primes that have no composite multiples (e.g., primes larger than sqrt(n)), their count_p would be zero.

Once we have count_list, compute the prefix sums.

prefix = []

s=0

for c in count_list:

    s +=c

    prefix.append(s)

Then, for each k from 2 to n:

if k <=m: answer is 1.

else:

s =k -m

find the smallest index i where prefix[i] >=s.

answer is primes[i]

To perform this efficiently for all k, we can precompute the prefix array and use binary search.

But for each k, s can be up to (n -m). For each such s, we need to find the first prefix[i] >=s.

In Python, the bisect module can be used. For example:

import bisect

# prefix is the list of prefix sums.

for each s in s_values:

    idx = bisect.bisect_left(prefix, s)

    p = primes[idx]

Thus, the code.

Now, putting it all together.

But let's test for n=4.

primes are [2,3].

count_list is [1,0].

prefix = [1,1].

For k=4: s=4-3=1. bisect_left(prefix,1) returns 0. So p=2.

Which is correct.

Another example: n=5.

primes are [2,3,5].

count_list is [1,0,0].

prefix = [1,1,1].

k=5: s=5-4=1. bisect_left(prefix,1) returns 0. So p=2.

Another example: n=6.

primes are [2,3,5].

m=4.

composites are 4 (spf=2),6 (spf=2). So count for 2 is 2, for 3:0,5:0.

prefix = [2,2,2].

For k=5: s=1. idx=0 →p=2.

k=6: s=2. idx=0 →p=2.

So the output for k=5 and 6 is 2.

For k=4: 1.

Thus, output is 1 1 2 2 2.

Which makes sense.

So the code should work.

Now, let's write the code.

But we need to read n from input, compute sieve, primes, count, prefix, then generate the output.

But for n up to 5e5, the sieve will take O(n log log n) time, which is acceptable.

The code outline:

Read n.

if n <2:

    but n >=2 per problem constraints.

compute sieve and spf.

primes = list of i where spf[i] ==i.

m = 1 + len(primes).

if m >=n:

    all k from 2 to n have I_k=1. So output '1 '*(n-1) → but wait, for n=2, m=2, which is >=n=2. So output is '1'.

else:

    compute count_p for each prime.

    create count_list in the order of primes.

    compute prefix.

    then, for each k from 2 to n:

        if k <=m: 1

        else:

            s =k -m

            find idx in prefix with bisect_left.

            answer is primes[idx].

But the code must output the answers for k=2 to n in order, as space-separated integers.

But generating the output for all k from 2 to n can be done by precomputing an array.

But for n up to 5e5, we need to generate a list of n-1 elements, which is possible.

But how to handle this efficiently.

So, steps:

Initialize a result list.

for k in 2..n:

    if k <=m:

        res.append(1)

    else:

        s =k -m

        idx = bisect.bisect_left(prefix, s)

        res.append(primes[idx])

Then, print ' '.join(map(str, res)).

But for large n (5e5), this loop can take O(n) time, which is acceptable.

The sieve is O(n log log n), which is manageable.

The sieve for n=5e5 is manageable.

Now, let's implement this.

But in Python, sieve for 5e5 is feasible.

Now, code:

import bisect

n = int(input())

if n ==1:

    print() # but according to problem statement, n>=2.

spf = list(range(n+1))  # Initialize spf to i for all i.

primes = []
for i in range(2, n+1):
    if spf[i] == i:
        primes.append(i)
        for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
            if spf[j] == j:
                spf[j] = i
    else:
        continue

m = 1 + len(primes)
if m >=n:
    # All k from 2 to n are <=m. So output 1s.
    print(' '.join(['1']*(n-1)))
else:
    # Compute count_p for each prime.
    from collections import defaultdict
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for x in range(2, n+1):
        if spf[x] != x:
            p = spf[x]
            count[p] +=1

    # Create count_list in the order of primes.
    count_list = []
    for p in primes:
        count_list.append(count.get(p,0))

    # Compute prefix sums.
    prefix = []
    s =0
    for c in count_list:
        s += c
        prefix.append(s)

    # Generate result.
    res = []
    for k in range(2, n+1):
        if k <= m:
            res.append(1)
        else:
            s_k = k - m
            # Find the first index where prefix >= s_k.
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(prefix, s_k)
            res.append(primes[idx])

    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

But let's test this code with the examples.

First example:

n=2.

primes is [2].

m=1 +1=2. Since 2 >=2 (n=2), output '1'.

Which matches.

Second example: n=3.

primes are [2,3].

m=1+2=3. n=3, m >=n. So output '1 1'.

Third example: n=4.

primes are [2,3].

m=3. n=4. So m <n.

count_p for 2 is 1 (4's spf is 2).

count_list is [1,0].

prefix = [1,1].

For k from 2-4:

k=2: 1.

k=3:1.

k=4: s=4-3=1 →bisect_left(prefix,1) →0 →primes[0]=2.

So res is [1,1,2]. Output '1 1 2'.

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=5.

primes are [2,3,5].

m=4. n=5.

composites are 4 (spf=2), 6 (but n=5, so not included). So count_p for 2 is 1, 3:0,5:0.

count_list is [1,0,0].

prefix is [1,1,1].

For k=5: s=5-4=1. idx=0 →2.

Output for k=5 is 2.

So the code outputs 1,1,1,2.

Wait, for k=2,3,4: 1. k=5: 2.

So output is '1 1 1 2'.

But n=5, output is for k=2,3,4,5: 4 elements.

Yes.

Another test case: n=6.

primes are 2,3,5.

m=4.

composites:4 (spf=2),6 (spf=2),9 (spf=3, but n=6 so 9 is beyond), 8 (beyond), etc.

Wait, n=6. So numbers up to 6:

composites are 4,6.

spf[4]=2, spf[6]=2.

So count_p for 2 is 2 (4 and 6). count_p for 3 is 0 (since 6's spf is 2). count_p for 5 is 0.

count_list = [2,0,0].

prefix = [2, 2, 2].

m=4. For k from 5 to 6:

k=5: s=1 →bisect_left([2,2,2], 1) →0. p=2.

k=6: s=2 →bisect_left returns 0 (since prefix[0] is 2 >=2). p=2.

So output for k=2-6 is [1,1,2,2,2].

Which makes sense.

So the code seems correct.

Now, let's handle some edge cases.

n=6.

Output is 1 1 2 2 2.

For k=4: m=4 →k=4 is <=m →1.

k=5: s=1 →p=2.

k=6: s=2 →p=2.

So code works.

Another case: n=7.

primes are 2,3,5,7 →m=5.

composites are 4,6, 8 (n=7 → no), 9 (no), etc.

Wait, n=7:

composites are 4 (spf=2), 6 (spf=2), 8 (no), 9 (no). So composites in [2..7] are 4,6.

So count_p for 2 is 2. 3,5,7: 0.

count_list = [2,0,0,0].

prefix = [2,2,2,2].

k from 2 to7:

k=2-5 →1.

k=6: s=6-5=1 →p=2.

k=7: s=2 →p=2.

So output is 1 1 1 1 2 2.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code works.
