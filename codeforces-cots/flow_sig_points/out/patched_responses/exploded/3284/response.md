Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimal total length of prefixes for each variable name such that all these prefixes are unique. So each variable's new name is a prefix of its original name, and they all have to be unique. And we want to minimize the sum of the lengths of these prefixes.

Hmm. So the main idea is that for each variable, we need to choose the shortest possible prefix that is not used by any other variable in a way that all are unique. But how to approach this efficiently, especially with the constraints up to 1e5 variables and total string lengths up to 1e5.

Let me think. Maybe building a trie (prefix tree) would help here. Because the trie can represent all possible prefixes, and we can track how many times each prefix is used. Then, for each variable, we need to find the smallest possible prefix (i.e., the shortest one) that is unique.

But the trie approach could be memory-intensive if not handled properly. Let's think about how to structure this.

Another approach: since all variables are unique, but their prefixes may not be. For each variable, we need to find the earliest prefix that is not a prefix of any other variable. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the new names must be unique, but each new name is a prefix of their original name. So for example, if two variables have the same original name, their prefixes would have to be different. But in the problem statement, the original variable names are all distinct, so that's not possible. But the prefixes could overlap between different variables.

For example, in the first sample input, the variables are codeforces, codehorses, code. So their prefixes must be different. The optimal in the example is "cod", "co", "c". So the first variable's prefix is length 3, the second 2, third 1. So the sum is 6.

So the key is that for each variable, we need to find the shortest prefix that is not a prefix of any other variable's original name, and also not chosen as a prefix by any other variable.

Wait, but how do we handle this? Because the choices are interdependent. Choosing a prefix for one variable affects the available prefixes for others.

This seems complex. So perhaps the correct approach is to process the variables in a certain order, and for each, determine the minimal possible prefix that is unique.

Alternatively, think of all possible prefixes of each variable and for each possible prefix, track how many variables have that prefix. Then, for each variable, the minimal length is the smallest k such that the k-length prefix of the variable is unique (i.e., not present as a prefix in any other variable's prefixes except itself). But wait, no. Because even if two variables have the same k-length prefix, but in their own prefixes, they might have to choose longer ones.

Alternatively, the problem can be thought of as for each variable, we need to select a prefix that is not a prefix of any other variable's original name. Because if a variable's selected prefix is a prefix of another variable's original name, then that other variable might have to choose a longer prefix, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no. Because the other variable could choose a prefix that is a prefix of their own name, but perhaps that's longer than the prefix chosen here.

Wait, perhaps the minimal total sum can be found by ensuring that for each variable, the chosen prefix is the minimal possible length such that no other variable's original name starts with this prefix. Because if another variable's original name starts with the same prefix, then that variable's chosen prefix must be longer than the current variable's prefix, which would complicate the selection.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when each variable's chosen prefix is the minimal possible length such that that prefix is not a prefix of any other original variable name. Because once you select a prefix that is not a prefix of any other original name, then you can safely use that prefix. Because the other variables can then choose their own prefixes, possibly shorter, but perhaps not conflicting with yours.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if variable A's original name is "code" and variable B's original name is "codehorses". Then if variable B chooses the prefix "codeh", which is longer than "code", but variable A's chosen prefix is "cod" (so that "cod" is not a prefix of B's original name?), but "cod" is a prefix of "codehorses", which is B's name. Wait, but "cod" is a prefix of "codehorses" (since codehorses starts with code, which starts with cod). So if A's chosen prefix is "cod", then B's chosen prefix cannot be a prefix that starts with "cod", which would include any prefix of B's name. So B's prefix must be longer than 3. But that's not possible, because B's name is "codehorses". So B would have to choose a prefix longer than 3. But if B's name is longer than 3, then the minimal prefix length for B would be 4, perhaps.

So the problem arises when two variables have names that are prefixes of each other. For example, if one variable is "code" and another is "codehorses". Then the "code" variable must choose a prefix that is not a prefix of the other variable. But the other variable's name is longer. So for the "code" variable, the prefixes are "c", "co", "cod", "code". The "codehorses" has prefixes "c", "co", "cod", "code", "codeh", etc. So the "code" variable's minimal possible prefix is 4, because any shorter prefix (like 3) would be a prefix of "codehorses". But wait, no. The original names are "code" and "codehorses". So the "code" variable's prefixes up to length 4 are all prefixes of "codehorses". So the minimal prefix that "code" can choose is 4 (the entire name) because any shorter prefix would also be a prefix of "codehorses", so if "code" chooses "cod", then "codehorses" can't choose any prefix that starts with "cod", but since it's longer, the codehorses would have to choose a longer prefix. But then how?

So in this case, "code" must choose a prefix that is not a prefix of any other variable. So for "code", the prefixes are all up to length 4, but "code" is a prefix of "codehorses". So "code" must choose its entire name (length 4) as the prefix, because any shorter prefix (like 3) is a prefix of "codehorses", but then "codehorses" cannot choose any prefix that starts with that. But "codehorses" can choose a longer prefix, like "codeh", which is not a prefix of "code". So in this case, "code" can choose "cod", but "codehorses" would have to choose a longer prefix. Wait, but that would conflict. Because if "code" has prefix "cod" (length 3), then "codehorses" can't have any prefix that starts with "cod". So any prefix for "codehorses" must be longer than 3. So "codehorses" has to choose a prefix of length 4 (like 'codeh'), but then that's allowed. Because the prefix of "codehorses" is 'codeh', which is longer than the prefix chosen by "code", which is 'cod'. So in this case, "code" can choose 'cod' (3), and "codehorses" chooses 'codeh' (5), sum is 8. Alternatively, if "code" chooses 'code' (4), then "codehorses" can choose 'c' (1) for sum 5. So that's better. Wait, but then "codehorses" can't choose 'c' because 'c' is a prefix of "code". But in that case, if "code" is using 'code', which is not a prefix of "codehorses" (since "codehorses" is longer but starts with 'code'), then the 'c' prefix for codehorses would not be a prefix of code's chosen prefix. Wait, code's chosen prefix is 'code', codehorses's chosen prefix is 'c'. So 'c' is a prefix of 'codehorses' (yes), but 'code' is not a prefix of 'c'. So the two chosen prefixes are 'code' and 'c', which are different. So that's allowed. So the sum would be 4+1=5, which is better. But how is that possible?

Wait, the problem says that the new names must be unique. So in this case, code's new name is 'code', codehorses' new name is 'c'. Since 'code' and 'c' are different, that's acceptable. So the sum is 5, which is better than the previous case. So in this scenario, the codehorses can take a shorter prefix, but code must take a longer one.

So the key is that the prefixes must be unique among themselves, regardless of their original names. So even if a prefix of A is a prefix of B's original name, as long as the chosen prefixes of A and B are different, it's allowed. But in this case, the code's prefix is 'code', and codehorses's prefix is 'c' which is a prefix of code's original name. But code's original name is 'code', but code's new name is 'code', which is a prefix of codehorses' original name. Wait, codehorses's original name is 'codehorses', which starts with 'code'. So 'code' is a prefix of codehorses's name. So if code's new name is 'code', then codehorses can't choose any prefix that is a prefix of code's new name. Because codehorses's new name must be a prefix of its original name, which is 'codehorses'. So codehorses's new name could be 'c', but then code's new name is 'code' which is a longer prefix. But 'c' is a prefix of code's new name. Wait, but code's new name is 'code', codehorses's new name is 'c'. Are they allowed? Because the problem says that the new names must be unique. So 'c' and 'code' are different, so it's allowed. So yes.

So in this scenario, code can choose 'code', codehorses can choose 'c', sum 5, which is better. So the conclusion is that the way to minimize the sum is that variables can choose prefixes that are prefixes of other variables' original names, as long as their own prefixes are unique.

So the problem isn't about avoiding prefixes that are present in other variables' original names. It's about making sure that the set of chosen prefixes are all unique. So even if two variables have prefixes that are part of another's original name, as long as the chosen prefixes are different, it's okay.

So the approach needs to find for each variable the minimal possible prefix length such that no other variable's chosen prefix is the same. But since the chosen prefixes depend on each other, how do we model this?

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie, where each node represents a prefix, and we need to assign each variable to a node in the trie such that each node is assigned to exactly one variable, and the sum of the depths (lengths) of the nodes is minimized.

So building a trie structure where each node in the trie corresponds to a prefix. For each variable, all prefixes (all possible lengths) are nodes in the trie. Then, we need to select exactly one node (prefix) for each variable such that no two variables share the same node, and the sum of the depths is minimized.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, for each variable, the optimal prefix is the smallest possible k such that the k-length prefix is unique in the trie. But how to model this.

Wait, here's another approach: For all possible prefixes of all variables, count how many variables have that prefix. Then, for each variable, the minimal possible prefix is the smallest k where the count of the k-length prefix in the variable's own string is 1. Because if that prefix is present in exactly one variable (the current one), then that prefix can be chosen. However, this isn't sufficient because other variables might have longer prefixes that include this one.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, if variable A's original name is 'cod' and variable B's is 'code', then the prefixes 'cod' of A and 'cod' of B's (since B's name starts with 'cod') would count as 2. So for variable A, the minimal prefix is 3 (since 'cod' is the only prefix that exists in this case, but if another variable B has 'cod' as a prefix, then variable A's count for k=3 is 2. So variable A would have to choose a longer prefix (but its original length is 3, so no longer exists. So variable A would have to choose 3, but if variable B's original name is 'code', then variable B's prefixes up to 4. So variable B's minimal k is 4, which gives sum 3+4=7. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps variable B can choose a shorter prefix.

Hmm. So perhaps the count approach isn't sufficient. Let's think again.

The problem is to assign each variable a prefix (non-empty) such that all assigned prefixes are unique, and the sum of their lengths is minimized.

The key is that each variable's chosen prefix must be unique. So for a variable S, the minimal possible k is the smallest k such that no other variable has a prefix equal to the k-length prefix of S.

Wait, no. Because even if another variable's k-length prefix is the same as S's k-length prefix, but that variable chose a longer prefix for itself, then S can choose that k-length prefix. Because the other variable's chosen prefix is longer, so they are different.

So for example, variable A is 'cod', variable B is 'code'. Then, A's prefixes are 'c', 'co', 'cod'. B's prefixes are 'c', 'co', 'cod', 'code'. If A chooses 'cod' (k=3), B can choose 'code' (k=4). The sum is 7. Alternatively, if B chooses 'cod' (k=3), then A can't choose that, so A must choose a longer prefix, but can't. So that's impossible. So the first scenario is the only way.

But if we have variable C with name 'co', then variables A and B can't choose 'co' as their prefixes, because C's chosen prefix could be 'co', but then A and B have to choose longer ones.

So the problem is that each chosen prefix must be unique. So the approach is to select a set of prefixes, one per variable, such that all are unique, and the sum is minimized.

So how to model this.

An efficient way to handle this might be to build a trie of all possible prefixes of all variables, and then for each variable, select the shortest possible prefix in their trie path that is not used by any other variable.

But how to process this for all variables efficiently.

Another idea is to process the variables in reverse order of their length. For example, process longer variable names first. Because if a longer variable is processed first, it can take a longer prefix, allowing shorter variables to take shorter prefixes.

Alternatively, process variables in reverse order of their sorted names.

But this is getting a bit vague.

Alternatively, for each variable, all possible prefixes are considered. The problem is to select one prefix per variable such that all are unique and the sum is minimized.

This is similar to the problem of assigning each item to a resource, where each resource can be used by only one item, and each item has a list of possible resources (sorted by cost, which in this case is the length of the prefix), and we need to find an assignment that minimizes the total cost.

This is known as the assignment problem in bipartite graphs, but for large n (1e5), we can't use standard algorithms like the Hungarian method, which is O(n^3).

So we need a more efficient approach.

Alternatively, think of this as a greedy problem. For each variable, we want to select the shortest possible prefix (smallest k) that is not yet taken by any other variable.

But how to track which prefixes are taken.

But the problem is that when processing variables in some order, earlier variables might take prefixes that could have been used by later variables, leading to a larger sum.

So perhaps the optimal way is to process variables in the order of increasing length. For variables with longer names, they have more options (longer prefixes), so processing shorter ones first could reserve their shorter prefixes, forcing longer variables to use longer prefixes but perhaps leading to a smaller total sum.

Alternatively, another approach: For each possible prefix of all variables, we can track how many variables have this prefix. Then, for a variable S, the minimal k is the smallest k where the prefix S[0..k-1] occurs in exactly one variable. Because if this is the case, then S can take this prefix. But again, this might not work because other variables might have the same prefix but choose longer ones.

Alternatively, the minimal k for S is the smallest k where S's prefix is not a prefix of any other variable's name, or is a prefix of exactly one variable (S itself).

Wait, maybe not. Because even if a prefix is a prefix of another variable's name, but that variable chooses a longer prefix, then S can take that prefix.

So the key is that the chosen prefixes must be unique. So for S's chosen prefix, no other variable's chosen prefix can be the same.

Thus, for S to choose a prefix of length k, that prefix must not be chosen by any other variable.

So the problem is similar to a scenario where each variable has a list of possible prefixes (sorted by k, the length) and we need to select one from each list such that all selected elements are unique, and the sum of the k's is minimized.

This is a classic problem. For such cases, a greedy approach is to select for each variable the smallest possible k that hasn't been taken yet. But the order in which we process the variables is critical. For example, if two variables have the same minimal k, we need to choose which one takes it first, and the other has to take a higher k.

So perhaps the optimal way is to process the variables in an order that allows the minimal sum. For example, processing variables with fewer possible options (shorter names) first. Because they have less flexibility and need to take the earliest possible prefixes.

Alternatively, process variables in the order of their lexicographical sorted prefixes. Or perhaps sorted by the number of possible prefixes (i.e., their own length) in ascending order. So variables with shorter names are processed first.

But how to model this.

Another approach is to model this using a trie structure where each node (prefix) has a count of how many variables have this prefix. Then, for each variable, traverse the trie along its prefixes from shortest to longest, and select the first node (prefix) where the count is 1 (only this variable contributes to it). Wait, no. Because the count is the number of variables that have this prefix as a prefix of their own name. If a variable's prefix at length k has a count of 1 (only itself), then it can safely choose this prefix. Because no other variable has this prefix, so their chosen prefixes (which are longer) won't conflict.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if another variable has a longer name that starts with this prefix, but chooses a longer prefix. Then, the count for the prefix is 1 (the current variable), so the current variable can choose it, and the other variable can choose a longer prefix. So this seems like a valid approach.

So for each variable S, the minimal k is the smallest k such that the number of variables that have S[0..k-1] as a prefix is 1 (i.e., only S itself). Because if there are other variables that have this prefix, then they might choose a longer prefix, but if S takes this prefix, then the others can't.

So the approach would be:

1. For each possible prefix of all variables, compute how many variables have this prefix (including the variable itself if the prefix is part of its name).

2. For each variable, iterate through its prefixes from shortest to longest. The first prefix where the count is 1 is the minimal k. The sum of all such k's is the answer.

But how to compute the count for all prefixes efficiently.

This sounds like a job for a trie. Each node in the trie represents a prefix. The count for a node is the number of variables that have this prefix. Then, for a variable S, we can traverse the trie along the characters of S, and for each position k, check if the count is 1.

But building a trie for all prefixes of all variables could be O(total characters), which is acceptable since total characters is up to 1e5.

So the steps would be:

- Build a trie where each node represents a prefix. Each node has a count of how many variables pass through it (i.e., have this prefix).
- For each variable, traverse the trie along their characters. For each position k (from 1 to len(S)), check if the count at that node is 1. The first such k is the minimal possible for this variable. Sum all these k's.

This seems manageable.

For example, in the first sample input:

Variables are codeforces, codehorses, code.

Building the trie:

The root is empty. Then each character is added.

For 'codeforces', each prefix is 'c', 'co', 'cod', 'code', 'codef', etc. For each node, the count is incremented by 1.

Similarly for 'codehorses' and 'code'.

Then, for each variable:

- For 'codeforces', when we check each prefix:

At 'c' (count 3), 'co' (count 3), 'cod' (count 3), 'code' (count 3), 'codef' (count 1). So the first k where count is 1 is 5. But wait, the codeforces's length is 10. So the minimal k is 5. But the sample output's answer for codeforces is 3. Wait, this suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Wait, the sample's first example's output is 6, which is 3+2+1=6. For codeforces, the chosen prefix is 'cod' (3), codehorses is 'co' (2), code is 'c' (1). But according to the trie approach:

For 'codeforces', during the trie traversal:

'c' is part of all three variables, count 3.

'co' is part of all three variables, count 3.

'cod' is part of all three variables (code, codeforces, codehorses all start with 'cod'), count 3.

'code' is part of code, codeforces, codehorses. Count 3.

'codef' is only codeforces. Count 1. So the minimal k is 5.

But according to the sample, codeforces uses k=3. So this approach gives a different result. Which suggests that the approach is incorrect.

Hmm. So why is the sample answer correct? Because in the sample, codehorses uses 'co' (k=2), code uses 'c' (k=1), and codeforces uses 'cod' (k=3). But according to the trie approach, the count for 'cod' is 3 variables (code, codeforces, codehorses). So why is the codeforces allowed to choose 'cod' (k=3) when the count is 3?

Ah, because the trie approach's count is the number of variables that have that prefix. But if codehorses and code have prefixes longer than that, then their chosen prefixes are different. So the trie approach's count is not sufficient to determine whether a prefix is safe to choose. Because even if a prefix is present in multiple variables, those variables might have chosen longer prefixes, thus not conflicting.

So the trie approach's count is not the right measure. Because the count is the number of variables that have that prefix in their original name. But when choosing prefixes, the actual assignments may not use those prefixes.

For example, in the sample, codehorses and code choose shorter prefixes than codeforces. So codeforces can choose 'cod' even though other variables also have that as a prefix. But in the trie, 'cod' is present in three variables, so the count is 3. So the approach of looking for a count of 1 is invalid.

This indicates that the approach is incorrect. So the previous idea is wrong.

So we need to think differently.

Alternative idea: each variable must select a prefix such that no two variables select the same prefix. So the problem is equivalent to selecting a set of prefixes (each from a different variable's possible prefixes) such that all are unique, and the sum of their lengths is minimized.

This is similar to a bipartite matching problem where each variable is connected to all possible prefixes, and we need to select a matching with minimal cost. But with 1e5 variables, this is not feasible.

Another approach: For each variable, the minimal possible k is the minimal length where that prefix is not a prefix of any other variable's chosen prefixes. But this is circular.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as for each variable, the chosen prefix must be the minimal possible such that it is not a subset of any other variable's chosen prefixes. Wait, no. Because if two variables choose prefixes where one is a prefix of the other, but they are different, that's allowed. For example, 'c' and 'co' are allowed. So the problem is not about being a subset, but about equality.

So the key is that all chosen prefixes are unique. So the problem is to select a unique string for each variable (a prefix of their name) such that all are distinct.

To minimize the sum, we need to select the shortest possible unique prefixes.

So the problem reduces to finding, for each variable, the shortest possible prefix that is unique among all selected prefixes.

But how to compute this.

An alternative approach is to model this as a problem where we can assign each variable a unique prefix, and we need to find the assignment with the minimal sum of lengths. Each variable's possible prefixes are all the non-empty prefixes of its name.

The way to model this is to use a trie where each node (prefix) can be marked as used. For each variable, we traverse the trie along the characters of its name, and for each node (prefix), we check if it's already used. The first unused node (shortest possible) is chosen for the variable. Then, we mark that node as used, and proceed to the next variable.

But the order in which variables are processed is critical here. For example, processing variables with longer names first may lead to higher sum, but processing variables with shorter names first allows them to take the shortest possible prefixes.

So the optimal order is to process variables in the order of increasing length. Because variables with shorter names have fewer options (shorter prefixes), so they should choose their shortest possible prefix first. Variables with longer names can then choose longer prefixes if necessary.

Let's test this idea with the first sample input.

Variables are codeforces (length 10), codehorses (length 9), code (length 4).

Processing in order of increasing length: code (4), codehorses (9), codeforces (10). 

Processing 'code' first. Its possible prefixes are 'c', 'co', 'cod', 'code'. We check each in order. 'c' is available. Assign 'c' (k=1). Mark 'c' as used.

Next, codehorses. Check prefixes in order: 'c' is already taken. 'co' is available. Assign 'co' (k=2). Mark 'co'.

Next, codeforces. Check 'c' (taken), 'co' (taken), 'cod' (available). Assign 'cod' (k=3). Sum is 1+2+3=6, which matches the sample.

If variables were processed in a different order, the sum might be larger.

So the key is to process variables in the order of their name lengths, shortest first. For each variable, select the shortest possible available prefix.

This seems to work for the sample. Let's test the second sample:

Input:

5

abba (4)

abb (3)

ab (2)

aa (2)

aacada (6)

The variables sorted by length are ab (2), aa (2), abb (3), abba (4), aacada (6).

Processing order: ab (2), aa (2), abb (3), abba (4), aacada (6).

Processing 'ab' (length 2). Prefixes: 'a', 'ab'.

Check 'a' first. Assign 'a' (k=1). Mark 'a' as used.

Processing 'aa' (length 2). Prefixes: 'a', 'aa'.

Check 'a' is taken. So assign 'aa' (k=2). Sum 1+2=3.

Processing 'abb' (3). Prefixes: 'a', 'ab', 'abb'.

Check 'a' (taken). 'ab' is available. Assign 'ab' (k=2). Sum +=2.

Processing 'abba' (4). Prefixes: 'a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abba'.

Check 'a' (taken), 'ab' (taken), 'abb' available. Assign 'abb' (k=3). Sum +=3. Total sum is 3+2+3=8 so far.

Processing 'aacada' (6). Prefixes: 'a', 'aa', 'aac', 'aaca', 'aacad', 'aacada'.

Check 'a' (taken). 'aa' is available? 'aa' is the prefix of 'aa' variable's name, which was assigned 'aa' (k=2). So 'aa' is already taken. So next prefix 'aac' (k=3). Check if available. Assign 'aac' (k=3). Sum +=3. Total sum is 1+2+2+3+3= 1+2=3 (ab and aa) +2 (abb's 2) → sum up to 3+2=5, then 'abba' adds 3, sum 8, then 'aacada' adds 3 → total 11. Which matches the sample output.

So this approach works for the sample.

So the algorithm is:

1. Sort all variables by the length of their names, ascending.

2. For each variable in this order, find the shortest possible prefix that hasn't been assigned to any previous variable. Assign this prefix to the variable, mark it as used, and add the length to the sum.

3. The sum is the minimal possible.

To implement this, we need an efficient way to track the used prefixes and find the shortest available prefix for each variable.

Using a trie structure where each node represents a prefix, and each node has a flag indicating whether it's already taken. For each variable, we traverse the trie along the characters of its name, checking each prefix (from shortest to longest). The first prefix that is not marked as taken is selected. Once selected, the node is marked as taken, and all longer prefixes for this variable are irrelevant since the earliest possible is chosen.

But how to implement this efficiently.

The trie nodes can be represented as a dictionary of dictionaries. Each node is a dict mapping a character to the next node. Additionally, each node has a 'taken' flag.

For each variable:

- Traverse the trie from the root.

- For each character in the variable's name:

   - If the current node is not taken, and none of the previous nodes (prefixes) have been taken, then this prefix is available. We select it.

   - Wait, but we need to check each prefix in order (from shortest to longest). So for each step, we check if the current node is available (not taken). If yes, take it and break. If not, proceed to the next character.

Wait, the algorithm would be:

For a variable S:

   Iterate through each possible prefix (from length 1 to len(S)):

      For each i from 1 to len(S):

         prefix = S[0:i]

         Check if this prefix is already taken.

         If not, take it and break.

So the first available prefix is the minimal possible.

But checking each prefix in order could be O(len(S)) for each variable. For total variables with sum of lengths up to 1e5, this is O(1e5) time.

But checking if a prefix is already taken can be done with a trie, but how.

Wait, in the trie approach, when processing a variable, we can traverse the trie character by character, building the prefix step by step. For each step (i), we check if the current node (representing the prefix up to i characters) is marked as taken. The first node that is not marked as taken is the one we can take.

But this is not correct. Because a node can be marked as taken even if it's not the end of a prefix. For example, if a variable's name is 'cod' and another is 'code', and 'cod' is taken, then the 'cod' node is marked as taken. When processing 'code', the first three characters (cod) are in the trie, and the node is marked as taken, so 'code' can't take 'cod' and must take 'code'.

So in the trie, each node (prefix) has a 'taken' flag. So when a prefix is taken, any longer prefix of that variable is not considered, but other variables can take their own longer prefixes.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

For each variable S in sorted order (by length ascending):

   current_node = root

   selected_k = None

   for i in 0 to len(S)-1:

       char = S[i]

       if char not in current_node's children:

           create a new node for char.

       current_node = current_node's child[char]

       if not current_node.taken:

           selected_k = i+1

           break

   if selected_k is None:

       # all possible prefixes are taken, must take the entire string

       current_node = root

       for i in 0 to len(S)-1:

           char = S[i]

           current_node = current_node's child[char]

       selected_k = len(S)

       current_node.taken = True

   else:

       # mark the selected node as taken

       current_node.taken = True

   sum += selected_k

So this way, for each variable, we traverse the trie step by step. The first node (prefix) that is not taken is chosen. If none are available, then the entire string is taken.

But wait, what if the entire string's node is already taken? For example, if two variables have the same name (but the problem says all variables are distinct). So that's not possible.

But variables have distinct names, so for the entire string, the node can only be created by this variable. So when processing variables in order of increasing length, variables with the same length are processed in some order, but their entire name is unique. So for a variable of length l, when we reach the end of the loop (i = l-1), the node for the entire string is created (if not already present), and since it's unique, its taken flag is false, so selected_k is set to l.

Thus, this approach should work.

Let's test this with the first sample:

Variables sorted by length:

code (4), codehorses (9), codeforces (10).

Processing code:

Traverse the characters 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e'.

For each step:

- 'c' node (length 1). Initially, not taken. So selected_k=1. Mark 'c' as taken. Sum is 1.

Processing codehorses (length 9):

Traverse 'c' (node is taken). So move to next character 'o' (current node's child is the 'o' node, which is part of 'co' prefix). Check if taken? The 'co' node's taken flag is not set yet (only 'c' is taken). Wait, no. Because when code was processed, the trie was built for 'c' (i=0) and then code continued to build 'o', 'd', 'e' nodes? No.

Wait, code's processing:

S is 'code', len 4.

Loop i from 0 to 3.

i=0: char 'c'. current_node is root. Check if 'c' exists. Initially, the root's children are empty. So create a new node for 'c'. current_node is now the 'c' node. The 'c' node's taken is False. So selected_k is 1. Mark 'c' as taken. Break loop. So the code's prefix is 'c' (k=1). The trie now has the 'c' node marked as taken. The 'c' node's children are not created beyond that.

Next, processing codehorses (len 9):

S is 'codehorses'. Loop i from 0 to 8.

i=0: char 'c'. current_node is root. Check if 'c' exists. Yes. current_node becomes 'c' node. Check if 'c' node is taken: yes. So proceed.

i=1: char 'o'. current_node is 'c' node. Check if 'o' is a child. Since code's processing created 'c' node but didn't proceed further (because code's processing stopped at i=0). So 'c' node has no children. So 'o' is not present. So create a new node 'o' under 'c'. current_node becomes 'o' node. Check if taken: false. So selected_k=2. Mark 'o' as taken. Sum becomes 1+2=3.

Then codehorses is assigned 'co' (k=2).

Processing codeforces (10):

S is 'codeforces'. i from 0 to 9.

i=0: 'c' node is taken. So proceed.

i=1: 'o' node (under 'c') is taken. So proceed.

i=2: 'd' character. current_node is 'c' -> 'o' (i=1), then 'd' is next. Check if 'o' has a child 'd'. Since codehorses's processing stopped at 'o' (i=1), the 'o' node has a child 'd'? No. Because codehorses's processing added 'o' as a child of 'c' and then checked if it's taken. The 'o' node is taken, so codehorses's processing stops there. So the 'o' node's children are not built. So codeforces processing will check 'c' (taken), then 'o' (taken), then check 'd' in the 'o' node's children. Since 'o' node's children are empty, 'd' is not present. So create 'd' node under 'o'. Now, current_node is 'd' node. Check if taken: no. So selected_k=3. Sum becomes 3+3=6. 

So the sum is 1+2+3=6, which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach works for the first sample.

Another test case: the third sample input.

Input:

3

telegram

digital

resistance

Sorted by length: digital (6), resistance (10), telegram (8). Wait, no. 'digital' is 6 letters, 'telegram' is 8, 'resistance' is 10. So sorted order is digital (6), telegram (8), resistance (10).

Processing digital:

Traverse 'd', 'i', 'g', 'i', 't', 'a', 'l'.

But wait, digital's length is 6. So i runs from 0 to 5 (since characters are 0-based indices). So the loop is for i in 0 to 5.

i=0: 'd' node. Not taken. Assign k=1. Sum is 1.

Processing telegram (8):

Traverse 't', 'e', 'l', etc. 't' is not in the root's children (root has 'd' from digital). So create 't' node. Assign k=1. Sum becomes 2.

Processing resistance (10): traverse 'r' (not present). Assign k=1. Sum becomes 3. So total is 1+1+1=3, which matches the sample.

So this approach works.

Thus, the algorithm is:

Sort variables by the length of their names in ascending order. For each variable in this order, traverse the trie character by character, checking at each step if the current node is taken. The first node (prefix) that is not taken is selected. Mark it as taken. If no such node is found (all prefixes are taken), select the entire name (which is unique).

The trie structure is built as we process each variable. For each character in the variable's name, we proceed along the trie. If a character is not present in the current node's children, we create a new node. Once a node is marked as taken, no other variable can use it as their prefix.

This approach ensures that variables with shorter names get their shorter prefixes first, allowing longer variables to take longer prefixes (if necessary) but not blocking shorter ones.

Now, to implement this in Python efficiently.

But how to represent the trie. Each node can be a dictionary of children (char to node), and a 'taken' flag.

But for efficiency, using a class-based node structure might be slow in Python for 1e5 nodes. So perhaps we can represent each node as a dictionary. For example, each node is a dict with 'children' (another dict) and 'taken' (a boolean).

But for the root node, it's initialized as an empty dict with 'children' and 'taken' as False.

Wait, perhaps each node is a dictionary. The root is a dictionary with 'children' as a defaultdict or a regular dict, and 'taken' as a boolean.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient way is to represent each node as a tuple (children, taken), but in Python, tuples are immutable, so we need to use a mutable structure.

So perhaps:

class TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ['children', 'taken']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.taken = False

But using __slots__ can save memory and speed up access.

The root is a TrieNode.

For each variable:

   current_node = root

   selected_k = None

   for i in range(len(s)):

       char = s[i]

       if char not in current_node.children:

           current_node.children[char] = TrieNode()

       current_node = current_node.children[char]

       if not current_node.taken:

           selected_k = i + 1

           current_node.taken = True

           break

   if selected_k is None:

       # All possible prefixes are taken; take the entire string

       selected_k = len(s)

       current_node.taken = True  # but current_node is already the last node (entire string)

   sum += selected_k

This would work.

But in the case where the entire string is processed (all prefixes are taken), we need to mark the last node (entire string) as taken. But since variables are processed in order of increasing length, and all variable names are unique, the entire string's node will not have been marked as taken by any previous variable.

So for example, if a variable is processed and all its prefixes are taken (which can only happen if another variable with a shorter name took all possible prefixes up to len(s)), but since the variable names are unique, the entire string's node must be unique, so the node can be marked as taken.

Thus, this code should handle that.

Now, testing this code on the samples.

Sample 1:

Variables sorted as code (4), codehorses (9), codeforces (10).

Processing code:

Loop over 0, 1, 2, 3 (since len is 4).

i=0:

char 'c' is not in root's children. Create new node. current_node is this new node (taken=False).

Check if taken is False: yes. selected_k=1. Mark as taken.

Sum is 1.

Processing codehorses (len 9):

Loop i from 0 to 8.

i=0:

char 'c' is in root's children. current_node is the 'c' node (taken=True). So can't use it.

i=1:

current_node is 'c' node. 'o' is not in children. So create 'o' node. current_node is 'o' node. taken is False. Assign k=2. Mark as taken. Sum is 3.

Processing codeforces (len 10):

i=0: 'c' is taken. move on.

i=1: 'o' is in 'c's children. current_node is 'o' node (taken=True). So can't use.

i=2: 'd' is not in 'o's children. Create 'd' node. taken is False. Assign k=3. Sum becomes 6.

So correct.

Sample 3:

Variables sorted as digital (6), telegram (8), resistance (10).

Processing digital:

i=0: 'd' not in root. create node, taken=True. selected_k=1. Sum 1.

Processing telegram: i=0: 't' not in root. create node, taken=True. sum 2.

Processing resistance: i=0: 'r' not in root. create node, taken=True. sum 3.

Thus, correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

But in Python, creating a TrieNode for each character may be memory intensive. However, given that the total sum of characters is 1e5, the trie's nodes are O(1e5), which is manageable.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Read n strings, store them.

Sort the strings by their length in ascending order.

Initialize sum = 0.

Create the root node (TrieNode).

For each string in the sorted list:

   current_node = root

   selected_k = None

   for i in range(len(s)):

       char = s[i]

       if char not in current_node.children:

           current_node.children[char] = TrieNode()

       current_node = current_node.children[char]

       if not current_node.taken:

           selected_k = i+1

           current_node.taken = True

           break

   if selected_k is None:

       selected_k = len(s)

       current_node.taken = True

   sum += selected_k

print(sum)

But in Python, using a class-based TrieNode may be slow for 1e5 operations. So perhaps we can represent each node as a dictionary.

Wait, but even a class with __slots__ should be efficient enough.

Alternatively, we can represent each node as a dictionary with 'children' and 'taken' keys. For example:

root = {'children': {}, 'taken': False}

But for speed, using a class is better.

But let's see:

Implementing the TrieNode class:

class TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ['children', 'taken']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.taken = False

Then, for each character in the string, check and create nodes.

This should be efficient enough.

Thus, the Python code would be:

Read all variables, sort them by length, then process as described.

Now, code:

class TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ['children', 'taken']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.taken = False

n = int(input())
strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
strings.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))

root = TrieNode()
total = 0

for s in strings:
    current = root
    selected = None
    for i in range(len(s)):
        c = s[i]
        if c not in current.children:
            current.children[c] = TrieNode()
        current = current.children[c]
        if not current.taken:
            selected = i + 1
            current.taken = True
            break
    if selected is None:
        selected = len(s)
        current.taken = True
    total += selected

print(total)

Testing this code on the samples.

Sample 1:

Input:

3

codeforces

codehorses

code

sorted by length:

code (4), codehorses (9), codeforces (10).

Processing 'code':

i=0: c. current is root. c not in children. create node. current becomes new node. current.taken is False. selected becomes 1. sum is 1.

Processing 'codehorses':

i=0: c. current is root's children[c], which is taken. i=1: o. current's children is empty. create node. selected becomes 2. sum is 3.

Processing 'codeforces':

i=0: c is taken. i=1: o. current's children has o? No, 'codehorses' created 'o' in the 'c' node's children. But 'codehorses' is 'codehorses', so the codehorses processing for i=0 is 'c' (taken), so i=1 is 'o' (codehorses's second character). So the 'o' node is created in 'c's children. So for codeforces's i=0: 'c' is taken. i=1: 'o' is now in 'c's children. current becomes 'o' node. which is taken (since codehorses's processing marked it as taken). So codeforces proceeds to i=2: 'd' is not in 'o's children. create 'd' node. current is 'd' node. taken is False. selected is 3. sum is 6.

Yes. Correct.

Sample 3:

Input:

3

telegram

digital

resistance

sorted by length: digital (6), telegram (8), resistance (10).

Processing 'digital' (6):

i=0: 'd' not in root. create node. selected is 1. sum 1.

Processing 'telegram' (8):

i=0: 't' not in root. create node. selected 1. sum 2.

Processing 'resistance' (10): i=0: 'r' not in root. selected 1. sum 3.

Correct.

Sample 2:

Input:

5

abba

abb

ab

aa

aacada

sorted by length: ab (2), aa (2), abb (3), abba (4), aacada (6).

Processing 'ab':

i=0: 'a' not in root. create node. selected 1. sum 1.

Processing 'aa':

i=0: 'a' exists. current is 'a' node, which is taken. So i=1: 'a' in 'a' node's children? No. create node. current is 'a' node's child 'a', marked as taken. selected 2. sum 3.

Processing 'abb' (3):

i=0: 'a' (taken). i=1: 'b' in 'a' node's children? No. create node. selected 2. sum 5.

Processing 'abba' (4):

i=0: 'a' (taken). i=1: 'b' (taken). i=2: 'b' in 'b' node's children? No. create node. current is 'b' node's child 'b'. selected 3. sum 8.

Processing 'aacada' (6):

i=0: 'a' taken. i=1: 'a' in 'a' node's children? Yes (from 'aa' processing). current is 'a' node's child 'a' (taken). i=2: 'c' not in 'a' node's children (current is 'a' node's child 'a', which is a different node). So create 'c' node. selected 3. sum 11.

Correct.

Thus, this code should work.

So the final code is as follows.
