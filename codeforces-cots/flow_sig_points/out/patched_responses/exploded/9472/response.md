Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions on their sides x, y, z. The conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But given the constraints x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest. Since x ≤ y ≤ z, the two smaller sides are x and y, so x + y > z is the critical condition.

So our approach is to find all possible triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z.

First, let's understand the ranges:

x ranges from A to B, inclusive.
y ranges from max(x, B) to C, but since B is between x and C (since x is <= B <= C), but since x can be up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C. Wait, no. Wait, the original condition says that B ≤ y ≤ C. Wait, the problem statement says that the inequalities are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be from A to B. Then y must be at least B and at most C. Then z must be at least C and at most D. Also, the constraints require that x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, but since x is ≤ B, y is ≥ B, so x ≤ y is automatically satisfied. Similarly, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, y ≤ z is automatically satisfied. So the x ≤ y ≤ z part is already enforced by the given ranges. So we don't need to check the order of x, y, z. So our problem reduces to counting all possible triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A,B], y is in [B,C], z is in [C,D], and x + y > z.

So the main condition to check is x + y > z. Our goal is to compute the number of such triples.

But the problem is that the ranges can be up to 5e5, so a brute force approach (iterating all x, y, z) would be O(B-A+1) * O(C-B+1) * O(D-C+1). If all are 5e5, then this is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about how to compute this efficiently. Let's fix x and y first, and find the number of z's that are in [C, D], >= C, <= D, and < x + y. Because z has to be >= C and <= D, and also >= y (since z >= C and y <= C, but z can be from C to D, but since y can be up to C, z is >= y. Wait, no: y is in [B, C], so z is in [C, D], which is >= y because C >= y. So z >= C >= y, so z >= y. So for a given x and y, the z must satisfy:

C ≤ z ≤ D, and z < x + y. Also, since z must be >= y (but since y <= C and z >= C, then z >= y is automatically true). So the valid z's are the integers in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. So for each x and y, the count of z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). But how to compute this efficiently.

But even computing this for all possible x and y is O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1)), which for 5e5 each is 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.

So we need a way to compute this more efficiently. Let's see if we can find a mathematical formula or a way to precompute certain ranges.

Let's think about the possible ranges of x, y, and z.

First, note that x is between A and B, y is between B and C. So x + y ranges from A+B (when x=A, y=B) to B + C (when x=B, y=C). But for each possible x and y, x + y can vary. The z must be less than x+y and at least C.

So for each x and y, the valid z is from C to min(D, x+y-1). The count of z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). Let's denote this as valid_z = max(0, (min(D, x + y -1) - C) + 1). But only if x + y > C. Otherwise, z >= C, which is >= x + y, so no possible z.

So the condition x + y > C must hold. Otherwise, for z >= C, x + y <= C <= z, so x + y <= z, which makes the triangle invalid.

So first, for x and y pairs where x + y > C, we have some possible z's. For other pairs, the count is zero.

So our problem reduces to:

Count the number of (x, y) pairs where x ∈ [A,B], y ∈ [B,C], and x + y > C. For each such pair, the number of z's is the number of z ∈ [C, D] such that z < x + y. So z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). The count is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C.

So the total number of triangles is the sum over x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of (max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)) if x + y > C.

But summing this directly is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) operations, which is way too slow for large B and C.

We need to find a way to compute this sum more efficiently.

Let's consider the variables. Let's denote:

low_xy = max(C + 1, x + y) → Wait, no. Wait, x + y must be > z. z has to be >= C. So z can be as low as C, but x + y must be > z. So for a given x and y, the minimal z is C, but to have x + y > z, we need x + y > C. So for x + y <= C, there's no possible z. For x + y > C, the maximum possible z is min(D, x + y - 1). So the count for z is:

if x + y <= C: 0
else: max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) 

So the problem is to compute for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], where x + y > C, the value of min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1, and sum all these values.

But how can we compute this sum efficiently?

Let's split the possible (x, y) pairs into two cases:

Case 1: x + y -1 <= D. Then the count is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.

Case 2: x + y -1 > D. Then the count is D - C + 1.

So for each (x, y) pair where x + y > C, the count is:

if x + y -1 >= C: then the count is min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1.

Wait, but x + y must be > C. So x + y -1 >= C is equivalent to x + y > C. Which is already the case. So perhaps we can model this as:

count = min(x + y -1, D) - C + 1, but only when x + y > C.

Wait, if x + y > C:

Then the minimal z is C, the maximal z is min(D, x + y -1). The number of z's is (max_z - C + 1) = (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1). Which is equivalent to (x + y -1 - C + 1) if x + y -1 <= D → x + y - C. If x + y -1 > D → then D - C + 1.

So the count is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) when x + y > C.

So the sum can be written as the sum over x and y where x + y > C of (max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)).

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative approach: Let's think of x and y as variables. Let's fix x, then for each x, find the number of y in [B, C] such that x + y > C. For each such y, compute the count of z's and sum over y.

But even this seems tricky. Let's consider that for a fixed x, the possible y ranges from B to C. Let's find the minimal y such that x + y > C. Let's denote y_min for x as max(B, C - x + 1). Because y needs to be >= B and x + y > C implies y > C - x. So y >= C - x + 1. Since y is >= B, the minimal y for x is max(B, C - x + 1). But if C -x + 1 > C, then there are no valid y for this x. So in that case, the minimal y would be larger than C, which is impossible. So in such cases, there are no y's.

Wait, let's see: For x in [A, B], we need y >= B, y <= C. So if x is such that even the minimal possible y (y = B) has x + B <= C, then there are no valid y's. Because then for any y >= B, x + y >= x + B <= C. So x + y > C is impossible. So for x where x + B > C → x > C - B, then there are possible y's. Otherwise, x <= C - B, then y can be as low as B, but x + B <= C → x + y <= C. So no valid y's.

So for x in [A, B], the minimal x where there are any valid y's is x > C - B. So x >= (C - B) + 1. Because x must be greater than C - B for x + B > C.

So the x values that contribute are those x in [A, B] where x > (C - B). Let's denote x_start = max(A, (C - B) + 1). Because if x is <= C - B, then x + B <= C, so no y in [B, C] will satisfy x + y > C.

So for x >= x_start, we have possible y's.

So for each x in [x_start, B], the y's that contribute are those y >= max(B, (C -x) + 1) and y <= C.

Wait, let me rephrase. For a given x, y must be in [B, C], and y >= (C -x + 1) to satisfy x + y > C.

So the valid y's for x are from y_min to C, where y_min = max(B, C - x + 1).

But since y must be >= B and <= C, the valid y's are those y in [y_min, C], but if y_min > C, then there are no y's.

So for x in [x_start, B], the possible y's are from max(B, C - x + 1) to C. Let's call this interval [y_min, C]. The number of such y's is C - y_min + 1, provided y_min <= C.

Now, for each such (x, y), the count of z's is as discussed earlier.

So for each x, we need to find the sum over y in [y_min, C] of (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).

But even this approach would be O(B * (C - B)), which is still too slow for large B and C.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute for each x, the possible y range, and then compute the sum over y in that range of (x + y -1 - C + 1) if x + y -1 <= D, otherwise (D - C + 1).

But even that is O(N^2), which is not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's see: for a given x, the sum over y of the z counts can be split into two parts:

1. y's where x + y -1 <= D → the z count is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = (x + y - C).

2. y's where x + y -1 > D → the z count is (D - C + 1).

So for each x, the sum over y in the valid range can be split into two intervals of y:

a. y <= D - x +1.

b. y > D - x +1.

Wait, for a given x and y, x + y -1 <= D → y <= D -x +1.

So the sum for a given x can be split into two parts:

- For y in [y_min, y1], where y1 is the maximum y such that x + y <= D +1 → y1 = min(D -x +1, C). So in this interval, the count per y is (x + y - C).

- For y in [y2, C], where y2 = max(y_min, D -x +2), the count per y is (D - C +1).

So the total for x is:

sum_{y = y_min to y1} (x + y - C) + sum_{y = y2 to C} (D - C +1).

If y1 < y_min, then the first sum is zero. If y2 > C, then the second sum is zero.

So let's formalize this:

For a given x:

Compute y_min = max(B, C -x + 1)

If y_min > C → no contribution. So skip x.

Else:

Compute the threshold y where x + y = D +1 → y = D -x +1.

So y1 = min(D -x +1, C).

The first part is y from y_min to y1 (inclusive), the count is sum (x + y - C).

The second part is y from max(y_min, y1 + 1) to C, the count is sum (D - C +1).

So the sum for x is:

sum_{y = a to b} (x + y - C) + sum_{y = c to d} (d_z), where d_z is D - C +1.

We can compute these two parts using arithmetic series formulas.

First part:

The sum (x + y - C) for y from a to b is sum ( (x - C) + y ) → (x - C)*(b - a +1) + sum y from a to b.

Sum y from a to b is (a + b) * (b - a +1) / 2.

So the first part becomes (x - C) * (b - a + 1) + (a + b)*(b - a +1)/2.

The second part is (D - C +1) * (d - c +1), where d - c +1 is the number of terms.

So for each x, the contribution can be computed in O(1) time, given the correct a, b, c, d.

Thus, the overall approach would be:

Loop x from x_start to B:

   if x is such that x + B <= C → skip (but x_start is already >= (C - B +1), so x + B > C).

   compute y_min = max(B, C - x +1)

   if y_min > C → continue

   else:

      y_low = y_min

      y_high = C

      Now, split into two parts:

      threshold_y = D -x +1

      part1_y_max = min(threshold_y, C)

      part1 starts at y_low and ends at part1_y_max, but only if y_low <= part1_y_max.

      part2 starts at max(y_low, part1_y_max + 1) and ends at C, but only if this start <= C.

      So:

      a = y_low

      b = part1_y_max

      c = part2_start = part1_y_max +1

      d = C

      Now, compute the sum for part1:

      if a > b:

          part1 = 0

      else:

          part1 = (x - C)*(b -a +1) + (a + b) * (b -a +1) // 2

      part2:

          part2_start = c

          part2_end = d

          if part2_start > part2_end:

              part2 = 0

          else:

              part2 = (D - C +1) * (part2_end - part2_start +1)

      total_contribution = part1 + part2

      add to the answer.

Thus, each x is processed in O(1) time.

Now, the question is, how to loop x efficiently.

The x starts from x_start = max(A, C - B +1). Because for x < C - B +1, x + B <= C → no possible y.

So x must be >= max(A, (C - B) + 1). But wait, let's check:

The condition for x is that x + B > C. Because for y to be >= B, x + y >= x + B. So x + B > C → x > C - B.

So x >= (C - B) + 1.

Thus, x must be in the range [x_start, B], where x_start is max(A, (C - B) + 1).

If x_start > B → no possible x's, so answer is 0.

Else, for x in x_start to B, inclusive.

Now, how to compute x_start:

x_start = max(A, (C - B) + 1)

But if (C - B) +1 > B, then no x's. So x_start must be <= B.

Because (C - B) +1 can be up to (C - A) +1 if B is A. But since C >= B >= A, then C - B can be 0 (if B = C), leading to x_start = max(A, 1). But perhaps not, but the code can handle it.

So the code would first compute x_start = max(A, (C - B) + 1). Then, if x_start > B → answer is 0.

Else, loop through x from x_start to B.

But wait, even if x_start is <= B, but for some x in that range, the y_min could be greater than C. For example, x is very large, so C -x +1 could be larger than C. But since y can't exceed C, in that case, y_min would be max(B, C -x +1), but if C -x +1 > C, then y_min is B, but if B > C, which can't happen since B <= C.

Wait, B is <= C. So y_min is max(B, C -x +1). Since B <= C and C -x +1 can be <= or >= B.

For example, x = B. Then C -x +1 = C - B +1. Since B <= C, this is >=1. So if B is 2, C is 3, x=2, then C -x +1 = 2 → y_min is max(2, 2) = 2. Which is correct.

Another example: x is large. Let's say C is 5, B is 3, x is 4. Then C -x +1 = 5 -4 +1 =2. So y_min is max(3, 2) →3. So y starts at 3.

But for x in x_start to B, the x is such that x >= (C - B) +1. Let's see:

If x is (C - B) +1, then x + B = (C - B +1) + B = C +1, which is > C. So for x = (C - B) +1, the minimal y is B. So y starts at B.

So for x >= (C - B) +1, x + B > C → the minimal possible y (B) gives x + y = x + B > C. So y_min for x >= (C - B)+1 is max(B, C -x +1).

But since x >= (C - B) +1 → C -x +1 <= C - (C - B +1) +1 = B. So C -x +1 <= B. So y_min is max(B, ...) → B.

So for x >= (C - B) +1, y_min is B. Wait, let's see:

If x >= (C - B) +1, then C - x +1 <= C - (C - B +1) +1 = B.

Because x >= (C-B) +1 → x ≥ (C - B) +1 → C -x ≤ C - (C - B +1) = B -1 → C -x +1 ≤ B.

So, for x >= (C - B) +1, C -x +1 <= B. Therefore, y_min = max(B, C -x +1) → since B >= C -x +1, the max is B. So y_min is B.

Wait, this is a key insight. Because for x >= (C - B) +1, the y_min is B. Because C -x +1 ≤ B.

So, for x >= x_start (where x_start is max(A, (C-B)+1)), the y_min is B. So for all x in [x_start, B], the valid y starts from B and goes up to C.

This is a crucial simplification. So now, for x in x_start to B, the y ranges from B to C, and the condition x + y > C is automatically satisfied (since x >= (C-B)+1 → x + B >= (C-B+1) + B = C +1 > C).

So for these x's, all y in [B, C] are valid. Now, the problem is to compute for each x in [x_start, B], the sum over y in [B, C] of (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).

But again, the sum is over y, which can be up to C. So how to compute this sum efficiently for each x.

Wait, but with the previous approach, for each x, the sum can be split into two parts: part1 where x + y -1 <= D (y <= D -x +1) and part2 where y > D -x +1.

But since y ranges from B to C, part1's upper limit is min(D -x +1, C), and part2's lower limit is max(B, D -x +2).

But given that y ranges from B to C, this can be simplified.

So for a given x, the sum over y in [B, C] is:

sum_{y=B to min(C, D -x +1)} (x + y - C) + sum_{y = max(B, D -x +2) to C} (D - C +1).

But how to compute these two parts.

Let me rephrase this:

For a given x:

1. Find all y in [B, C] such that x + y -1 <= D → y <= D -x +1.

   Let upper1 = min(C, D -x +1).

   The number of such y is upper1 - B + 1 (if upper1 >= B).

   The sum for these y is sum_{y=B to upper1} (x + y - C).

   This sum can be written as sum (x - C) + sum y → (x - C) * (upper1 - B +1) + sum_{y=B to upper1} y.

   Sum y from B to upper1 is (B + upper1) * (upper1 - B +1) / 2.

2. For y in [upper1 + 1, C], if any, the z count is D - C +1.

   The number of such y is max(0, C - (upper1 + 1) + 1) → max(0, C - upper1).

   So the sum here is (D - C +1) * (C - upper1).

Thus, the total contribution for x is:

part1 + part2 = [(x - C) * (upper1 - B +1) + (B + upper1) * (upper1 - B +1) // 2 ] + (D - C +1) * (C - upper1).

But upper1 is min(C, D -x +1).

So for each x, we compute upper1 as min(C, D -x +1). Then:

if upper1 >= B:

   part1 is (x - C) * (upper1 - B +1) + (B + upper1) * (upper1 - B +1) // 2.

else:

   part1 is 0.

part2 is (D - C +1) * max(0, C - upper1) if upper1 < C.

Wait, upper1 can be up to C. So if upper1 is C, part2 is zero. If upper1 < C, then part2 is (D - C +1) * (C - upper1).

But how to compute upper1:

upper1 = min(C, D -x +1).

So for each x, let's compute:

threshold = D -x +1.

upper1 = min(C, threshold).

If threshold < B → upper1 < B → part1 is 0.

Else:

upper1 = max(B, threshold) → no, wait. Wait, upper1 is the min of C and threshold.

If threshold < B → upper1 would be min(C, threshold) which is threshold, but threshold < B. But B is <= C, so threshold < B → upper1 = threshold < B → part1 is 0.

If threshold >= B → upper1 can be B or higher.

So for part1 to be non-zero, upper1 must >= B.

So:

upper1 = min(C, D -x +1)

if upper1 >= B → part1 is as computed.

else → part1 is 0.

So combining this:

So, for each x in x_start to B:

Compute threshold = D - x + 1.

upper1 = min(C, threshold).

if upper1 >= B:

   count1 = upper1 - B +1.

   sum_part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (B + upper1) * count1 // 2.

else:

   sum_part1 = 0.

sum_part2 = (D - C + 1) * max(0, C - max(B, threshold + 1) + 1 )

Wait, part2's y starts from max(B, threshold +1). Wait, no. Because part1 covers y up to threshold. So part2 is y from threshold+1 to C. But y must also be >= B and <= C.

So part2's y starts at threshold + 1 if threshold +1 <= C. But if threshold >= C → part2 is zero.

So part2's y range is [threshold +1, C], but also y must be >= B.

So part2's lower bound is max(threshold +1, B).

But upper1 is min(C, threshold) → threshold may be >= or <= C.

Wait, let me re-express:

After part1, part2 is for y where y > threshold.

But threshold can be up to C. So if threshold is C, then part2's y starts at C+1, which is beyond C → part2 is zero.

If threshold < C → part2's y starts at threshold+1 and goes up to C, but only if threshold+1 >= B.

Wait, but part2's y must be in [B, C]. So:

part2_start = threshold +1.

part2_end = C.

But part2_start must be <= part2_end, and part2_start >= B.

So the valid part2 y's are from max(B, part2_start) to part2_end.

The count is max(0, part2_end - max(B, part2_start) +1).

But part2_start = threshold +1 = D -x +1 +1 = D -x +2.

But threshold can be up to C. So part2_start could be C +1 (if threshold = C), which would make part2_end (C) < part2_start → no part2 contribution.

So in code:

part2_start = threshold + 1 = (D -x +1) + 1 = D -x +2.

part2_low = max(B, part2_start)

if part2_low > C → part2_count = 0.

else → part2_count = C - part2_low +1.

sum_part2 = (D - C +1) * part2_count.

But part2_count is (C - part2_low +1) if part2_low <= C else 0.

So putting this together:

For a given x:

threshold = D -x +1.

upper1 = min(C, threshold).

if upper1 >= B:

   count1 = upper1 - B + 1.

   sum_part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (B + upper1) * count1 // 2.

else:

   sum_part1 = 0.

part2_start = threshold + 1.

part2_low = max(B, part2_start)

if part2_low > C:

   sum_part2 = 0.

else:

   sum_part2 = (D - C +1) * (C - part2_low +1).

total_contribution = sum_part1 + sum_part2.

Add this to the answer.

Thus, each x can be processed in O(1) time.

Now, the key is to compute this for all x in x_start to B. The number of x's is O(B - x_start + 1) = O(B - (C - B +1) +1) if x_start is (C-B+1). But when B and C are large, say up to 5e5, this is O(5e5) steps, each with O(1) operations. Which is acceptable.

So the algorithm's time complexity is O(B - x_start +1) → which is O(B) in the worst case. Since B can be up to 5e5, this is manageable within 1 second.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input: 1 2 3 4.

So A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.

x_start is max(1, (3-2)+1) → max(1, 2) → 2. So x can be 2.

For x=2:

threshold = D -x +1 = 4-2+1=3.

upper1 = min(C=3, threshold=3) →3.

Since upper1=3 >= B=2.

count1 =3-2+1=2.

sum_part1 = (2-3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-1)*2 + 5*1 → -2 +5 =3.

part2_start=3+1=4.

part2_low = max(2,4) →4. But C=3. So part2_low=4>3 → sum_part2=0.

Total contribution for x=2 is 3+0=3.

But wait, according to the first example, the answer is 4. So where is the error?

Wait, the first example's output is 4. Let's see what's wrong.

Wait in the first example, the x can be 1 and 2. Wait, but according to x_start being max(1, (3-2)+1) → (3-2 is 1, +1 is 2) → max(1,2) → 2. So x starts at 2.

But according to the sample input, x can be 1. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x is in [A, B], which is 1 to 2. So x can be 1 or 2.

But according to our x_start calculation, x must be >= (C - B) +1 = (3-2)+1 = 2. So x=1 is not considered. But in the sample input, one of the valid triangles is (1,3,3). So x=1, y=3, which is allowed. So how come x=1 is allowed here?

Ah, here's the mistake. Our initial x_start is computed as max(A, (C-B)+1). But for x=1, which is in [A, B], but x=1 < (C-B)+1=2. So x=1 is not considered. However, in the sample input, x=1 is allowed. So why?

Because the condition for x is not x + B > C. For x=1, B=2. So x + B = 3. Which is equal to C=3. So x + B > C is not true. So y must be >= B=2 and <= C=3. For x=1, y can be 2 or 3.

But x + y must be > z, which is >=C=3. For example, x=1, y=3. Then x + y =4> z (which is 3 or 4). So this contributes to the sum.

Wait, but according to our previous reasoning, x must be >= (C - B) +1. But for x=1, which is less than 2, we have x + B = 1 + 2 = 3. Which is not greater than C=3. So x + y can be greater than C. For example, if y=3, x=1, then x + y =4>3. So even though x < (C-B)+1=2, there are y's for which x + y > C.

Ah, here's the error in our initial reasoning. The initial x_start was computed assuming that for x < (C-B) +1, x + B <= C. But this is only true if y >= B. But y can be higher than B, leading to x + y > C even for x < (C-B) +1.

So the previous approach is wrong.

This is a critical mistake. So our initial approach is incorrect. So we need to re-examine the problem.

So the correct condition for a pair (x, y) to contribute is x + y > C. So even if x is less than (C-B) +1, but y is large enough (y >= C -x +1), then x + y can be > C.

So our previous assumption that x has to be >= (C-B) +1 is incorrect.

So the x_start should not be max(A, (C-B) +1). Instead, for any x in [A, B], the minimal y that satisfies x + y > C is y >= max(B, C -x +1). So even x < (C-B) +1 can have valid y's if y >= C -x +1 and >= B.

So the previous approach is wrong. We need to consider all x in [A, B], and for each x, find the y_min = max(B, C -x +1). If y_min > C, then no contribution. Otherwise, compute the sum for y in [y_min, C].

So the previous approach of x_start = max(A, (C-B)+1) is incorrect. The x can be any in [A, B], but y_min can be higher than B.

Thus, we need to process all x in [A, B], but for each x, compute y_min as max(B, C -x +1). If y_min > C → no contribution. Else, proceed to compute the sum.

But this would require looping through all x in [A, B], which can be up to 5e5 steps, which is manageable. But for each x in [A, B], the code must compute y_min and proceed accordingly.

So this changes the approach. The correct way is to iterate all x in [A, B], and for each x:

compute y_min = max(B, C -x +1).

if y_min > C → continue.

else:

compute the sum over y in [y_min, C], and compute the count for z as before.

But now, the number of x's is up to 5e5, which is acceptable as long as each step is O(1).

So the corrected approach is:

For each x in [A, B]:

   compute y_min = max(B, C - x +1).

   if y_min > C → continue.

   else:

      compute the sum over y in [y_min, C] of the z count.

The z count is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1, but only if x + y > C. However, since y >= C -x +1, x + y >= C -x +1 +x = C +1 > C. So x + y is always > C. So the z count is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C +1).

So the previous approach, but x starts from A to B.

But looping through 5e5 x's and for each x, doing O(1) calculations would be acceptable.

But how to compute the sum over y in [y_min, C] of min(D, x + y -1) - C +1.

As before, split into two cases: x + y -1 <= D and x + y -1 > D.

So for each x:

y ranges from y_min to C.

For each y in this range:

the z count is:

if x + y -1 <= D → (x + y -1 - C +1) = x + y - C.

else → (D - C +1).

So for a given x, the sum is:

sum_{y = y_min to y1} (x + y - C) + sum_{y = y2 to C} (D - C +1), where:

y1 = min(C, D -x +1).

y2 = max(y_min, D -x +2).

So the code for each x is:

sum_part1 = 0

sum_part2 = 0

y_min = max(B, C - x +1)

if y_min > C:

   continue

threshold = D -x +1

y1 = min(C, threshold)

y2_start = threshold + 1

y2_start = max(y2_start, y_min)

if y1 >= y_min:

   count1 = y1 - y_min +1

   sum_part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (y_min + y1) * count1 // 2

if y2_start <= C:

   count2 = C - y2_start +1

   sum_part2 = (D - C +1) * count2

total_contribution = sum_part1 + sum_part2

add to answer.

This way, even x's that are less than (C-B) +1 are considered, as long as y_min is <= C.

So this corrects the initial error.

Now, let's re-calculate the first sample input:

A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.

x can be 1 or 2.

For x=1:

y_min = max(B=2, C -x +1=3-1+1=3) →3.

y_min=3, which is <= C=3.

threshold = D -x +1 =4-1+1=4.

y1 = min(C=3, 4) →3.

sum_part1: y ranges from 3 to3. count1=1.

sum_part1 = (1-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 → (-2) + 3 →1.

sum_part2: y2_start =4 +1=5, but max(y2_start, y_min=3) →5. which is >C=3 → sum_part2=0.

So contribution for x=1 is 1.

For x=2:

y_min = max(B=2, C -x +1=3-2+1=2) →2.

threshold=4-2+1=3.

y1 = min(3,3)=3.

sum_part1: y from 2 to 3. count1=2.

sum_part1= (2-3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-2) +5 →3.

sum_part2: y2_start=3+1=4. which >3. sum_part2=0.

contribution for x=2 is 3.

Total sum is 1+3=4, which matches the sample.

Another sample: input 1 2 2 5.

A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.

x ranges from 1 to 2.

For x=1:

y_min = max(2, 2 -1 +1=2) →2. C=2.

threshold=5-1+1=5. y1 = min(2,5) →2.

sum_part1: y=2. count1=1.

sum_part1= (1-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 →-1 +2 →1.

sum_part2: y2_start=5+1=6. >2 →0.

contribution 1.

For x=2:

y_min = max(2, 2-2+1=1) →2.

threshold=5-2+1=4. y1=min(2,4) →2.

sum_part1: y=2. count1=1.

sum_part1 = (2-2)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 →0 +2=2.

sum_part2: y2_start=4+1=5. >2 →0.

contribution 2.

Total sum is 1+2=3, which matches the sample.

Third sample:

A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.

x can be 500000.

y_min = max(500000, 500000 -500000 +1=1) →500000.

threshold=500000 -500000 +1=1. C=500000. So y1=1. But y_min=500000>1. So sum_part1=0.

sum_part2: y2_start=1+1=2. >= y_min=500000. But C=500000. So sum_part2=0.

contribution is 0. But sample output is 1. What's wrong here?

Wait, sample input is 500000 500000 500000 500000. So x=500000, y=500000, z=500000. The condition is x + y > z →500000 +500000>500000 →1e6>5e5 → yes. So the count is 1.

But according to the code:

x=500000.

y_min = max(500000, C -x +1) →500000 -500000 +1=1. So max(500000, 1) →500000.

threshold = D -x +1=5e5-5e5+1=1. So y1=min(C=5e5,1) →1.

But y_min=5e5>1 →sum_part1=0.

sum_part2: y2_start=1+1=2. y_min=5e5. So y2_start=2, max(y2_start, y_min=5e5) →5e5. But C=5e5. So count2=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.

sum_part2= (5e5 -5e5 +1)*1 →1*1=1.

So contribution is 0 +1=1. Which matches the sample.

So code is correct.

Thus, the corrected approach is to iterate all x from A to B, compute y_min as max(B, C -x +1), and proceed as before.

So the code will look like:

Read A, B, C, D.

ans = 0

for x in range(A, B+1):

    y_min = max(B, C - x +1)

    if y_min > C:

        continue

    threshold = D - x + 1

    y1 = min(C, threshold)

    part1 = 0

    if y1 >= y_min:

        count1 = y1 - y_min + 1

        part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (y_min + y1) * count1 // 2

    part2_start = threshold + 1

    y2_start = max(part2_start, y_min)

    part2 = 0

    if y2_start <= C:

        count2 = C - y2_start + 1

        part2 = (D - C + 1) * count2

    ans += part1 + part2

print(ans)

But wait, in Python, looping from A to B could be up to 5e5 iterations, which in Python is manageable within 1 second. Let's check: 5e5 iterations are 500,000 iterations. Each iteration has a few arithmetic operations, which in Python are fast. So yes, this code should work.

Testing the third sample:

x=500000:

y_min = max(500000, 500000-500000 +1) →max(500000,1) →500000.

threshold = 500000 -500000 +1 =1.

y1 = min(500000, 1) →1. Since y_min is 500000, y1 < y_min → part1 is 0.

part2_start=1+1=2.

y2_start= max(2, 500000) →500000.

But C=500000.

So count2=500000 -500000 +1=1.

part2= (500000 -500000 +1) *1=1.

ans +=1.

So code works.

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    A, B, C, D = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    ans = 0

    for x in range(A, B + 1):
        y_min = max(B, C - x + 1)
        if y_min > C:
            continue
        threshold = D - x + 1
        y1 = min(C, threshold)
        
        part1 = 0
        if y1 >= y_min:
            count1 = y1 - y_min + 1
            part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (y_min + y1) * count1 // 2
        
        part2_start = threshold + 1
        y2_start = max(part2_start, y_min)
        part2 = 0
        if y2_start <= C:
            count2 = C - y2_start + 1
            part2 = (D - C + 1) * count2
        
        ans += part1 + part2

    print(ans, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
500000 500000 500000 500000
""",
            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But note that in Python, looping from A to B can be time-consuming if B is up to 5e5. Let's see:

In Python, a loop with 5e5 iterations is manageable, but let's see.

For example, in code:

A=1, B=5e5.

But in Python, for x in range(A, B+1): would take O(n) time. For 5e5 iterations, each iteration is very fast (only arithmetic operations). So this should be acceptable.

Thus, the code should work.
</think>

```python
A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0

for x in range(A, B + 1):
    y_min = max(B, C - x + 1)
    if y_min > C:
        continue
    threshold = D - x + 1
    y1 = min(C, threshold)
    
    part1 = 0
    if y1 >= y_min:
        count1 = y1 - y_min + 1
        part1 = (x - C) * count1 + (y_min + y1) * count1 // 2
    
    part2_start = threshold + 1
    y2_start = max(part2_start, y_min)
    part2 = 0
    if y2_start <= C:
        count2 = C - y2_start + 1
        part2 = (D - C + 1) * count2
    
    ans += part1 + part2

print(ans)
```
