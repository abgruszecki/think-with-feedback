Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of changes needed so that the string has at least k different characters. Or output impossible if it's not possible. Hmm.

First, I need to understand when it's impossible. Oh right, if the length of the string is less than k. Because even if all characters are different, you can't have more than the length. So for example, if the string is length 5, and k is 6, it's impossible. So first check if len(s) < k → output impossible.

Wait, but the problem says "contains at least k different letters". So if the string's length is n, the maximum possible distinct letters is min(n, 26). Wait, 26 is the maximum possible distinct letters since there's 26 lowercase letters. So, if k > 26, it's also impossible. Wait, the constraints say k is up to 26. Oh, looking at the input constraints: the second line is integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). So k can't be more than 26. So the only impossible case is when the required k is larger than the possible maximum distinct letters the string can have after changes. Which is min(len(s), 26). So if len(s) < k → impossible. Or if even after changing all characters, the maximum possible distinct is less than k. Wait, the maximum possible is min(len(s),26). So if k > min(len(s),26), then impossible.

Wait, but len(s) can be up to 1000. So for example, if len(s) is 1000, but k is 30. But since 26 is the maximum possible, then output impossible. But according to the problem's constraints, k is up to 26. So the input's k will never be larger than 26. So maybe the only impossible case is when the current distinct count plus possible new characters can't reach k.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that you can change characters. So even if the current distinct letters are less than k, but the length of the string is >= k, then you can add new letters. For example, in the second sample, 'yahoo' has length 5. So the maximum possible distinct is 5. So when k is 5, possible. But in the sample, the original distinct is 4, so we need to make one change to get a fifth.

So the impossible case is when the required k is larger than the maximum possible, which is min(len(s), 26). So first, check if k > min(len(s),26). If yes, output impossible. Otherwise, proceed.

So the first step is to check if k exceeds this maximum. If it does, output impossible. Otherwise, calculate the minimum changes.

Now, the main part is to compute the minimal changes. Let's think: the string's current distinct characters is m. Let's count how many distinct characters are present in the original string. Let's call that current_unique.

If current_unique >= k: then no changes needed. Like the first sample.

If current_unique < k: then we need to add (k - current_unique) new characters. But how?

Each new character added requires that we change some existing characters. The key is to decide which characters to replace and which new characters to add to minimize the total changes.

The strategy here is to replace the characters that have the highest frequency. Because by replacing the most frequent ones, we can free up more positions to introduce new characters with minimal changes.

Wait, here's the approach:

We need to have at least k distinct characters. Let's say the current number of distinct is m. So we need to add (k - m) more distinct characters.

But each new distinct character requires at least one occurrence. So for each new character, we need to replace one existing character (since all existing positions are already occupied by other characters). But perhaps if there are multiple duplicates, we can replace some of them to get new characters.

Wait, but for example, if the string is "aaaaa", m=1. If k=3, then we need to add 2 new distinct characters. So each new character requires at least one change. So the minimal changes would be 2: change one 'a' to 'b', another to 'c'. But if there are other characters with higher frequencies, maybe we can replace those.

Wait, the way to maximize the number of new distinct characters with minimal changes is to replace the most frequent characters first. Because each replacement of a frequent character can give us a new unique character. So for each new character we need to add, we can replace one occurrence of the most frequent character.

So the steps are:

1. Count the frequency of each character in the original string.
2. The number of unique characters is m. If m >= k, return 0.
3. Else, the required number of new characters is (k - m). Let's call this required_new.
4. To get these required_new new characters, each requires at least one change. So the minimal changes would be required_new, but only if there are enough positions where we can replace duplicates.

Wait, no. Because the existing characters may have multiple duplicates. For example, if the current characters are a, b, c (each appearing once) and the rest of the string is d's. Then, to add new characters, you can replace the d's.

So the plan is:

Sort the frequencies in descending order. The most frequent characters are the ones that can be replaced to add new characters.

The number of existing characters that can be replaced (i.e., the sum of (count - 1) for each existing character) is the total possible positions where we can change a duplicate to a new character.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think: for each character, the number of duplicates is (count - 1). For example, if a character appears 5 times, there are 4 duplicates. So the sum of (count -1) across all existing characters gives the total number of duplicates. These are the positions that can be replaced without reducing the number of unique characters (since each existing character has at least one occurrence left).

But when adding new unique characters, each new unique character requires that we replace at least one existing occurrence. So for each new character needed, we need to have a position that is a duplicate (so that replacing it doesn't reduce the current unique count), or we have to replace a non-duplicate (which would reduce the current unique count, but since we are adding new ones, perhaps that's allowed).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

Suppose current unique is m. We need to reach k, which is larger than m. So required_new = k - m. We need to create required_new new unique characters. Each new character must not have been present in the original string.

Each new character requires that at least one position in the string is changed to that character. So for each new character, we need to make one change. But the question is: how many changes are needed in total.

But the problem is that existing characters may have duplicates. So for example, if a character 'a' appears 5 times, we can replace 4 of them. Each replacement could be used to add a new unique character. So for each replacement, we can get one new unique character. But each replacement can contribute to one new unique.

So the maximum possible new unique characters we can add is the sum of (count - 1) for each existing character. Because each (count -1) is the number of duplicates for that character, and each duplicate can be replaced to create a new unique character.

Wait, but if a character 'a' has count 5, then duplicates are 4. So if I replace one 'a' to 'b', then that adds 'b' (if not present before). But in this case, if 'b' wasn't in the original string, then that's one new unique. Then replacing another 'a' to 'c' adds another, etc. So the number of new uniques possible from 'a's duplicates is up to 4. So the sum of (count-1) across all existing characters gives the total number of possible positions where we can replace a duplicate and use that to add a new unique.

So the required_new can't exceed the sum of (count-1) for all existing characters. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because perhaps there are more positions than required_new. For example, if required_new is 2, but sum of (count-1) is 10. Then we can do it by replacing two duplicates.

But in that case, the minimal changes would be required_new, because each new unique requires exactly one change.

Wait, yes. Because each new unique character requires one change. So if you need to add x new uniques, you need x changes. But you can only do that if there are x duplicates (i.e., sum of (count-1) >= x). Otherwise, you need to replace some characters that are unique (thus decreasing the current unique count, but then adding new uniques).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Original unique count: m. Need to reach k. So required_new = k - m.

But the sum of duplicates (sum of (count-1) for all existing characters) is S.

If S >= required_new: then we can replace required_new duplicates, each with a new unique character. So the total changes is required_new.

But if S < required_new: then after replacing all duplicates (sum of (count-1)), we still need (required_new - S) more new uniques. But to get each of those, we have to replace a character that is unique in the original string. For example, if a character appears once in the original, replacing it would remove one unique (if we replace it with another existing character), but in our case, we are replacing it with a new unique character. Wait, no. Let's say original character 'a' appears once. If we replace it with 'x' (a new unique), then 'a' is still present once (if there are other 'a's). Wait, no. If 'a' had count 1, replacing it with 'x' removes 'a' from the count and adds 'x'. So the original unique count is m. If we replace a unique character's occurrence (count 1) with a new character, then the original unique count decreases by 1 (because 'a' is removed) and the new unique count increases by 1 (adding 'x'). So net change is zero. But in this case, how?

Hmm, this complicates things. Let's think: when you replace a character that was unique (count 1) with a new character (not in original), you lose one unique (the original) but gain a new unique. So m remains the same. So that's not helpful. But if you replace a unique character with another existing character, then m would decrease by 1, which is bad.

Wait, but in this case, we are trying to add new uniques. So perhaps the scenario is: the sum of (count-1) is S. If required_new <= S: then the minimal changes is required_new.

If required_new > S: then after using all S duplicates, we need (required_new - S) more new uniques. But how can we get those?

Each of those new uniques would require us to replace a character that is not a duplicate. Because after using all duplicates (count-1) for each character, the remaining required_new - S would require replacing characters that are unique (i.e., count 1).

But when you replace a unique character (count 1) with a new character (not present before), you're removing one unique (the original) and adding a new one. So net zero. So that's not helpful.

Wait, so this suggests that once you have S duplicates, the maximum possible new uniques you can add is S. So if required_new exceeds S, then it's impossible.

But wait, that can't be right. For example, consider the case where the original string has m unique characters, and sum S of duplicates is 0 (all characters are unique). Then required_new can't be more than S (which is 0), which would mean that it's impossible to add any new uniques. But that's not correct.

Wait, in that case, if the original string has all unique characters (say, len(s) = 5, so m=5), and k=5: then required_new is 0. But if k=6, then it's impossible because the sum of duplicates is zero, and the len(s) is 5. So in this case, the maximum possible is min(5,26) =5. So k=6 is impossible.

But perhaps the sum S of duplicates is not the correct measure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible number of new unique characters is (len(s) - m). Because the total length is n. Each new unique added requires at least one character. So, the maximum possible new uniques is (n - m), because each new unique requires at least one position. But since m is the current unique count, adding (n - m) new uniques would require that all existing m characters plus (n -m) new ones, for a total of m + (n -m) = n unique characters. Which is possible only if n ≤ 26.

So the maximum possible new uniques is (n - m), but only up to 26 - m.

Wait, maybe the correct way to compute whether it's possible is to check if (m + possible_new) >= k, where possible_new is the maximum of (n - m) and (26 - m). But no, because 26 is the maximum possible unique characters.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible unique characters after changes is min(n, 26). So the initial check is to see if k > min(n,26). If yes, output impossible.

Once that is handled, then the required_new is k - m. But how to compute the minimal changes.

So the required_new can be up to (min(n,26) - m). So required_new is (k - m) if possible.

So, the problem is to find the minimal changes to get required_new new unique characters.

Each new unique character added requires at least one change, but how can we minimize the total changes?

The approach is to:

1. Replace duplicates first. Because for each duplicate, replacing it with a new unique gives us +1 new unique with 1 change. So for required_new, if there are enough duplicates, the minimal changes are required_new.

But if there are not enough duplicates, then after replacing all duplicates, we need to find additional changes. But how?

Wait, perhaps the sum of all duplicates (sum of (count -1) for all existing characters) is S.

If required_new <= S: then the answer is required_new. Because each new unique can be obtained by replacing a duplicate (each requires one change).

But if required_new > S: then how?

In that case, after replacing all S duplicates, we have (required_new - S) new uniques needed.

But each of these requires replacing a character that is unique (count 1). But replacing such a character with a new unique would take away one unique and add another. So net zero. So that's no good.

Wait, this suggests that the maximum possible new uniques is S. But in that case, if required_new exceeds S, it's impossible. But that's not the case.

Wait, for example, let's say the original string is "aabbc", so m=3 (a, b, c). The sum of duplicates is (2-1)+(2-1)+(1-0) = 1+1+0=2. So S=2. The length is 5. So maximum possible uniques is 5. So if k is 5, required_new is 2. Then S is 2, which is exactly required. So changes needed is 2.

Another example: original string is "abc", m=3, len=3. So maximum possible uniques is 3. So k can't be more than 3.

Another example: original string is "aab", m=2 (a and b), len=3. So maximum possible uniques is 3. So if k=3, required_new is 1.

Sum of duplicates is (2-1) + (1-1) = 1. So required_new is 1 <= S=1. So changes needed is 1. Replace one of the 'a's with a 'c'.

Another example: original string is "aaaab", m=2 (a and b), len=5. Sum S is (4-1) + (1-1) = 3. So for k=5 (max possible), required_new is 3 (since 5-2=3). So changes needed is 3.

But wait, the maximum possible is min(5,26) =5. So required_new is 5-2=3. Sum S=3. So changes are 3.

So in this case, possible.

Now, what if the sum S is less than required_new?

For example, original string is "aabbcc", m=3. len is 6. So maximum possible uniques is 6. So k could be 6. required_new is 3.

Sum S is (2-1)*3 =3. So sum is 3. So required_new is 3. So changes needed is 3. Possible.

Another example: original string is "aabb", m=2, len=4. So maximum possible uniques is 4. required_new for k=4 is 2. Sum S is (2-1) + (2-1) =2. So changes needed is 2. Possible.

But what if required_new is larger than sum S?

Like original string is "aab", m=2, len=3. maximum possible uniques is 3. So required_new is 1. Sum S is 1. So possible.

But another case: original string is "aaab", m=2 (a and b). len=4. sum S is 3-1 + 1-1 =2. So required_new for k=4 is 4-2=2. sum S is 2. So changes needed 2.

But if k=3, sum S is 2. required_new is 1. sum >= required_new, so changes 1.

But what if sum S is 1, and required_new is 2?

Wait, how?

For example, original string is "aaabbc", m=3 (a, b, c). len=6. sum S is (3-1) + (2-1) + (1-1) =2+1+0=3.

Now, required_new could be 3 (if k=6). sum S=3. So possible. Changes needed 3.

But if required_new is 4, that's impossible because the maximum possible is 6 (but 26 is 26, but len is 6. So k can't exceed 6. So this case is not possible.

Another example: original string is "abcdd", m=4 (a, b, c, d). sum S is (1-1)*3 + (2-1) =1. So required_new for k=5 is 1. sum S is 1. So changes needed 1.

But if required_new is 2, sum S=1. So required_new is 2. sum S=1. Then it's impossible. Because even after replacing the duplicate (d), you can add one new unique. But you need 2. But len(s) is 5. So maximum possible is 5. But required_new is 1 (k=5, m=4). So sum S=1. So possible.

Wait, but in the case where sum S is less than required_new, how?

Hmm, maybe the initial reasoning is incorrect. Let's think again.

Suppose the sum S is the total number of duplicates (count-1 for each character). The required_new is the number of new uniques needed.

If sum S >= required_new: then each required_new can be obtained by replacing a duplicate. So the minimal changes is required_new.

If sum S < required_new: then even after replacing all duplicates, we need (required_new - sum S) more new uniques. How can we get those?

But when you replace a unique character (count 1) with a new unique character, you are effectively swapping one unique for another. So the net gain is zero. Because you lose the original unique and gain a new one.

So that doesn't help. Therefore, once all duplicates are replaced, there's no way to gain additional new uniques. So in that case, it's impossible.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because perhaps the sum S is 1, required_new is 2. Then sum S is less than required_new. But len(s) is 5, for example. So maximum possible uniques is 5. So required_new could be 3 (original m=2, required_new=3).

Wait, but how?

Let's take a concrete example. Suppose the original string is "aaaab" (m=2, a and b). sum S is 3. len=5. So maximum possible uniques is 5. So if k=5, required_new is 3. sum S is 3. So changes needed 3. Replace 3 a's with c, d, e. So the new string has a, b, c, d, e → 5 uniques.

Now, if sum S is 2, and required_new is 3. How?

Original string is "aaaabb" (m=2, a and b). sum S is (4-1) + (2-1) =3 +1 =4. So sum S is 4. len=6. So maximum uniques 6. So required_new=4 (k=6, m=2). sum S=4. So changes needed 4. Possible.

But if required_new is 5, sum S=4. Then it's impossible. But len(s) is 6. So required_new=5 would require 5 new uniques. sum S is 4. So sum S < required_new. So it's impossible.

But how?

Because after replacing 4 duplicates, you get 4 new uniques, bringing m to 2 +4=6. Which is the required k=6. So required_new=4. Hmm, but why would required_new be 4 in that case?

Wait, in the example where original m=2, len(s)=6. So maximum possible is 6. So k can be up to 6. So required_new would be k - m.

If k=6, required_new is 4. So sum S=4. So required_new=4. So changes needed 4. So possible.

So sum S >= required_new.

So in this case, when sum S is equal to required_new, it's possible. So the initial reasoning holds.

But if sum S is less than required_new, then it's impossible to achieve. So the minimal changes is impossible.

Wait, but how can sum S be less than required_new?

For example, take original string is "aabbc" (m=3). len=5. sum S is (2-1)+(2-1)+(1-1)=1+1+0=2. So sum S=2.

Suppose required_new is 3 (k=6, but len is 5, so max uniques is 5. So k can't be 6. So required_new=3 would be possible only if original m=2 and required_new=3, but len=5. So m=2, required_new=3. sum S=3.

Wait, perhaps this scenario is not possible.

Wait, perhaps sum S is the total number of duplicates. So when sum S >= required_new, it's possible. Otherwise, it's impossible. Because each required_new new unique requires a change, and each of those changes must come from a duplicate.

Wait, but this seems to be the case. So the minimal changes is max(required_new, ...). Wait, no. The minimal changes is required_new if sum S >= required_new, else impossible.

Wait, but how?

If sum S >= required_new: then required_new changes.

If sum S < required_new: then it's impossible.

Because after replacing all sum S duplicates, we have sum S new uniques. So m + sum S >=k ?

No, required_new is (k -m). So sum S must be >= required_new. Otherwise, even after replacing all duplicates, we can't get enough new uniques.

So for example, sum S=2, required_new=3. Then even after replacing 2 duplicates, we can get 2 new uniques. So m +2 = m + sum S. So if original m was 3, and required_new is 3, then m + sum S =3+2=5. Which is less than required_new (3) → 3+2=5, but required_new is 3? No, required_new is k -m. So if m=3 and k=6, required_new is 3. But sum S=2. Then after replacing 2 duplicates, the new m is 3 +2=5, which is less than k=6. So it's impossible.

So the conclusion is: sum S (sum of duplicates) must be >= required_new. Otherwise, even after replacing all duplicates, we can't reach the required k.

So the steps are:

- Check if len(s) < k or k>26 → impossible.

- Else:

   - current_unique = number of distinct characters in s.

   - if current_unique >= k: output 0.

   - else:

      - required_new = k - current_unique.

      - sum_duplicates = sum (count -1 for count in frequencies.values())

      - if sum_duplicates >= required_new: output required_new.

      - else: impossible.

Wait, that's not possible. Because even if sum_duplicates < required_new, but len(s) - current_unique >= required_new?

Wait, len(s) - current_unique is the maximum possible new uniques (because you can replace len(s) - current_unique characters (each being a duplicate) with new unique ones). No, that's not right.

Wait, the sum_duplicates is the sum of (count-1) for all existing characters. That's the total number of duplicates. So for example, for the string "aaaab", sum_duplicates is 3 (4-1) + (1-1) =3. So sum_duplicates is 3. So for required_new=3, sum_duples is sufficient. So the answer is 3.

But if sum_duplicates is 2 and required_new is 3. Then even after replacing 2 duplicates, sum_duples is 2, and required_new is 3. So impossible.

But what if len(s) is 5, current_unique is 2, sum_duplicates is 2. required_new is 3. Then the maximum possible uniques is 5. So m + sum_duplicates = 2+2=4 <5. So can we get 5?

Yes, but how?

Wait, maybe the approach is wrong. Because when sum_duplicates is 2, that means there are 2 duplicates. So replacing each with a new unique adds one. So after replacing 2, we get 2 new uniques. So m becomes 2+2=4. Then required_new is 3. But 4 is still less than k=5. So we need 1 more. But sum_duplicates is now 0. How?

Ah, maybe the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the sum_duplicates is the number of possible positions where you can replace a duplicate (so that after replacement, the original unique count doesn't decrease). But when you replace a duplicate, you can add a new unique. So each replacement contributes 1 to the new uniques. But after replacing a duplicate, the sum_duplicates may decrease.

But the sum_duples is the initial sum. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Because when you replace a duplicate, you may reduce the sum_duples for that character. For example, if a character has count 4 (sum_duplicates 3), and you replace one of them, then the count becomes 3, sum_duplicates becomes 2. But that's okay, because you can choose to replace the most frequent characters first, which would maximize the sum_duples available.

Wait, but the original sum_duples is the total number of duplicates. So replacing any of them would reduce the sum_duples. So in the initial approach, sum_duples >= required_new is required, but that's the initial sum. But after replacing some, the sum_duples decreases. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Hmm, but when you replace a duplicate, you are changing it to a new character. So the original character's count decreases by 1 (so sum_duples for that character is (count-1) becomes (count-2)). But the new character's count is 1 (so sum_duples for that character is 0). So the total sum_duples decreases by 1 for each replacement. So after each replacement, sum_duples reduces by 1. So in this case, the initial sum_duples must be >= required_new. Because each replacement reduces sum_duples by 1, but you need to do required_new replacements. So for example, if initial sum_duples is 3 and required_new is 3: sum_duples starts at 3. After first replacement: sum_duples becomes 2. But you need two more replacements. So after three steps, sum_duples is 0. But the required_new is achieved. So the initial approach is correct.

So sum_duples >= required_new is necessary. Otherwise, you can't make enough replacements. So the conclusion is:

If the required_new is <= sum_duples, then the answer is required_new.

Else, it's impossible.

So the algorithm is:

1. If len(s) < k → impossible.

   Or, if k > 26 → impossible (but according to input constraints, k can't be larger than 26).

   Wait, in the problem statement, the input constraints are 1 ≤k ≤26. So the second case is not possible. So the first check is len(s) >=k.

   But wait, len(s) can be 1000. So if k is 26, len(s) is 1000, which is >=k.

   So the first check is: if k > 26 → impossible. But according to the problem's input constraints, the second line is k (1<=k<=26). So the input will not have k>26. So the only possible impossible case is when len(s) <k. For example, len(s) is 5 and k is 6. So output impossible.

   So first check: if len(s) <k → output impossible.

   Else, compute current_unique.

   If current_unique >=k → output 0.

   Else, required_new = k - current_unique.

   Compute sum_duples = sum (count-1 for all characters in s).

   If sum_duples >= required_new → output required_new.

   Else → impossible.

Wait, but let's see the sample input.

Sample 2:

Input:

yahoo

5

The string is 'yahoo' → length 5. k=5. So len(s)=5 >=5. current_unique is 4 (y, a, h, o). required_new=1. sum_duples is:

counts: y:1, a:1, h:1, o:2. So sum_duples = (1-1)*3 + (2-1) = 0 +0 +0 +1 =1. So sum_duples=1 >= required_new=1. So output 1. Which matches the sample.

Sample3: 'google' (length6) and k=7. len(s)=6 <7 → output impossible. Which is correct.

Sample1: 'yandex' → len 6, k6. current_unique is6, so output 0.

Another test case: 'aab', len=3. k=3. current_unique is2. required_new=1. sum_duples= (2-1) + (1-1) =1. So required_new=1. sum_duples=1. output 1.

Another case: 'aabbc', len=5, k=5. current_unique=3. required_new=2. sum_duples: (2-1)*2 + (1-1) =2. sum_duples=2. output 2.

But what about a case where sum_duples < required_new?

For example, s='aab', len=3. k=3. current_unique=2. required_new=1. sum_duples=1. output1.

Another case: s='aabb', len=4. k=4. current_unique=2. required_new=2. sum_duples= (2-1)+(2-1)=2. So output 2.

Another example: s='aaab', len=4. current_unique=2 (a and b). required_new=2 (k=4). sum_duples=(3-1)+(1-1) =2+0=2. So sum_duples=2. required_new=2. output 2. Possible.

So this approach seems to work.

But let's think of a case where sum_duples is less than required_new. For example, s='aabb', len=4. current_unique=2. required_new=3. sum_duples=2. required_new=3. But len(s)=4. So the maximum possible uniques is 4. required_new is 3, sum_duples=2. So sum_duples< required_new. So output impossible. But how?

Because even after replacing 2 duplicates, we can add 2 new uniques. So m becomes 2+2=4, which is the required k=4. required_new was 2. So sum_duples=2. So it's possible.

Wait, but required_new is k - current_unique. So if k is 4, current_unique is 2, required_new is 2. sum_duples is 2. So required_new is 2, sum_duples is 2. So output 2.

So in that case, it's possible.

So the case where sum_duples is less than required_new would require that required_new > sum_duples. But required_new is (k - current_unique). So how can that happen?

For example, s='aab', len=3. current_unique=2. k=3. required_new=1. sum_duples=1. So sum_duples >= required_new. Output 1.

Another example: s='aab' (len=3), current_unique=2. k=3. required_new=1. sum_duples=1. So possible.

So when can sum_duples be less than required_new?

If, for example, the current_unique is 3, len(s)=5. k=5. required_new=2. sum_duples=1. So sum_duples < required_new. Then required_new=2. sum_duples=1. So sum_duples < required_new → output impossible.

But in this case, how can you get 2 new uniques when sum_duples is 1. Because replacing 1 duplicate gives 1 new unique. So total uniques would be 3 +1=4 <5. So it's impossible.

So the algorithm correctly outputs impossible.

Thus, the algorithm is:

Check if len(s) <k → impossible.

Else:

current_unique = number of distinct chars.

if current_unique >=k → 0.

required_new =k - current_unique.

sum_duples = sum(count-1 for count in frequency.values()).

if sum_duples >= required_new → required_new changes.

else → impossible.

So now, how to compute sum_duples.

Implementation steps:

Read the string s.

Compute the frequency of each character.

current_unique = len(frequency).

if len(s) <k → output impossible.

else if k>26 → impossible (but per input constraints, k can't be).

else if current_unique >=k → output 0.

else:

required_new =k - current_unique.

sum_duples = sum( (count-1) for count in frequency.values() )

if sum_duples >= required_new → output required_new.

else → output impossible.

Wait, but sum_duples can be sum of (count-1) for all characters. So for example, a character that appears 5 times contributes 4 to sum_duples.

Yes.

So now, the code.

In Python:

s = input().strip()

k = int(input())

frequency = {}

for c in s:

    frequency[c] = frequency.get(c,0)+1

current_unique = len(frequency)

n = len(s)

if k > 26 or n <k:

    print("impossible")

else:

    if current_unique >=k:

        print(0)

    else:

        required_new = k - current_unique

        sum_duplicates = sum( (count-1) for count in frequency.values() )

        if sum_duplicates >= required_new:

            print(required_new)

        else:

            print("impossible")

Wait, but the code for sum_duplicates is sum( (count-1) for count in frequency.values() )

Which gives the sum of (count-1) for each character.

Yes.

Testing the samples.

Sample 1:

Input: yandex → s has 6 unique characters. k=6. So current_unique >=k → 6 >=6 → output 0.

Sample 2:

Input: yahoo → s is y, a, h, o. current_unique=4. k=5. required_new=1.

sum_duplicates: o appears 2 times → 2-1=1. others are 1. So sum is 1. required_new=1. sum >= required_new. Output 1.

Sample3: google → len=6. k=7. len <7 → impossible.

Another test case: 'aab', k=3. len=3 >=3.

current_unique=2. required_new=1. sum_duplicates= (2-1) + (1-1) =1. Output 1.

Another test case: 'aaaab', k=5. current_unique=2. required_new=3. sum_duplicates= (4-1) + (1-1) =3. sum_duples >=3 → output 3.

Another test case: 'aabbc', current_unique=3, k=5. len=5.

sum_duplicates = (2-1)*2 + (1-1) →1+1=2. required_new=2. sum_duples=2 → output 2.

Another test case: 'aab', k=4 → len=3 <4 → impossible.

Another test case: 'abc', k=3 → output 0.

Another test case: 'abc', k=4 → len=3 <4 → impossible.

Another test case: 'aabbc', k=4. current_unique=3. required_new=1. sum_duples=2. Output 1.

So code works for these cases.

Thus, the code should handle all test cases correctly.
