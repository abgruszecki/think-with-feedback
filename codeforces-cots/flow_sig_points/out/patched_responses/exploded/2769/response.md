Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum possible length of the sum a + b when interpreted in some base p. The base p must be valid for both a and b, meaning that all digits in a and b must be less than p. Then, we compute the sum in base p and check its length. Our goal is to find the maximum possible length across all valid p.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out the possible valid bases p. For a number like a, the minimum possible p is one more than its maximum digit. For example, if a is 78, the digits are 7 and 8. Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait, in a number like 78, each digit must be less than p. So for a = 78 (as a string?), the digits are 7 and 8. Wait, no. Wait, but the problem says that a and b are given as numbers. Wait, wait, the input is two numbers a and b. Wait, but how are those numbers represented? Are they strings where each digit is considered, or are they integers in base 10? Because the problem statement says that a and b are the given summands. So, for example, in the first example input, a is 78 and b is 87. Then, the problem is considering each as numbers written in base p. So each digit of a and b (as written in their original form) must be less than p.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the problem says that the expression is written in base p. So a and b are written in base p, but in their original form (the input given to us). So for example, if the input is 78 and 87, those are the numbers written in base p. So each digit in a's digits (7 and 8) must be less than p, and same for b. So in this case, the minimum valid p is 9, because 8 is the maximum digit. So p must be at least 9. Then, for each p >= 9, we can compute a_p (the value of a in base p) and b_p (the value of b in base p), sum them, then compute the sum in base p, and count the number of digits.

Wait, wait. Wait, but how do we parse a and b into their values in base p? Because a and b are given as numbers in their original form. Wait, no. The input is given as two numbers a and b, but these numbers are written in some unknown base p. For example, the input 78 and 87 are treated as numbers in base p. So each digit of a and b must be valid in base p. So the first step is to determine all possible p values where the digits of a and the digits of b are all less than p.

So, first, for each number a and b, find the maximum digit. Then, the minimal possible p is max_digit_a + 1 and max_digit_b + 1, whichever is larger. So p must be greater than or equal to that.

Once p is determined, we can compute the values of a and b in base p (but how? Wait, no. Wait, the a and b are given as numbers, but those numbers are written in base p. So for example, if a is '78' (as a string), then in base p, it's 7 * p + 8. But the problem states that the input is given as numbers. Wait, the problem's input is given as two numbers a and b. So maybe the numbers a and b are written in base 10, but their digits must be valid in base p. So for example, if a is 78 (as a base-10 number), then its digits are 7 and 8, so p must be at least 9.

Ah, that's the key. So the first step is to parse a and b as strings to get their individual digits. Wait, but a and b are given as integers. Wait, the input is two numbers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000), but when we read them as integers, how do we get their digits? Because for example, the number 78 in base 10 is the string '78' which has digits 7 and 8. So perhaps we need to split each number into its individual digits by converting it to a string first.

So the approach would be:

1. For each of a and b, get their digits. So, for a, convert it to a string, then iterate through each character to get the digits as integers. Then find the maximum digit for a and for b.

2. The minimal possible base p is max(max_digit_a, max_digit_b) + 1. Because any base smaller than that would have at least one digit in a or b that is >= p, which is invalid.

3. Then, for each possible base p starting from p_min upwards, we need to compute a_p (the value of a when considered as a base-p number) plus b_p (the value of b as a base-p number), then represent this sum in base p and count the number of digits. We need to find the maximum number of digits across all valid p.

But wait, the sum can be very large. For example, if p is up to (since a and b can have digits up to 9, their minimal p is 10. Wait, but if a is 1000, then the digits are 1, 0, 0, 0. Max digit is 1, so p must be at least 2. So for example, if a is 1000 and b is 1000, then p_min is 2. Then, for p=2, a is 1000 in base 2, which is 8, and b is also 8, sum is 16. Represented in base 2, that's 10000, which has 5 digits. So the maximum possible length is 5. But in larger bases, the sum is 1000_p + 1000_p = 2000_p. Wait, no. Wait, 1000 in base p is p^3. Adding two of them gives 2*p^3. Then, converting 2p^3 to base p: the leading term is 2*p^3, which in base p would be written as 2000 (since 2*p^3 is 2*p^3 + 0*p^2 + 0*p +0). So the length is 4. But for p=2, the sum is 8 +8=16, which in base 2 is 10000 (length 5). So the maximum is 5 here.

So the minimal p is 2 here, but higher p's could give shorter lengths. But the maximum length occurs at p=2.

So, to find the maximum possible length, we need to check all possible p starting from p_min upwards. But how high can p be? Because for very large p, the sum a_p + b_p is (a in base p) + (b in base p) which is a + b (since in base p, the digits are interpreted as a = d_0 * p^(k-1) + ... + d_{k-1}, but if the digits are d_0 ... d_{k-1}, then in base p, the value is the same as the base-10 number when p is larger than all digits. Wait, no. Wait, the a and b in the problem are given as base-10 numbers, but their digits are to be interpreted as digits in base p. Wait, no. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Wait, the problem says that a and b are numbers in the problem's input. But in the problem's scenario, the original note had a and b written in some base p. But since the note is written, the problem is given a and b as strings in their own digits. However, the input to our program is given as two numbers a and b (integers). So this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem's input is two numbers a and b. For example, in the first example, input is 78 87. But these are the summands written in base p. So, for example, if p is 15, then a is '78' in base 15 (which is 7*15 +8 = 113 in base 10), and b is '87' in base 15 (8*15 +7 = 127 in base 10), sum is 240. Then, 240 in base 15 is 110 (15² +15 +0 = 225+15=240), which is 3 digits.

But when the problem says a and b are given as numbers, the code receives them as integers, but the way their digits are interpreted is as sequences of digits in base p. So, for example, the number 78 in the input is treated as the digits '7' and '8' in some base p, which must be >=9. So, in code, we need to process the digits of a and b as strings. So, the first step is to convert a and b to their string representations, split into digits (as characters), then convert each to integers to find the maximum digit in each.

Ah, right. So, for example, if the input is a=78, then as a string, it's "78", which has digits 7 and 8. So the maximum digit is 8, so p must be at least 9.

So the first step is to process the digits of a and b as strings to find their maximum digits. Then p_min is the maximum of the two max digits plus one.

So the code needs to:

1. For a and b (given as integers in the input), convert them to strings to extract their digits.

So, for example, if a is 1, then the digits are [1]. For a=1000, the digits are [1,0,0,0], max is 1.

Once we have the digits, compute max_a and max_b, then p_min = max(max_a, max_b) + 1.

If p_min is 0 (but since a and b are >=1, their digits are at least 1, so p_min is at least 2).

Then, for each possible p starting from p_min up to some maximum possible value, compute the sum of a_p and b_p (the values of a and b in base p) and then convert that sum to base p, and count the number of digits. The maximum length among all possible p is the answer.

But what's the upper limit for p? Since a and b can be up to 1000, but when p increases, the value of a_p and b_p decrease. For example, a in base p is the sum of digits multiplied by p^k. But as p increases, the value of a_p decreases. Wait, no. Wait, for example, the digits of a are d0, d1, ..., dn-1 (from left to right, i.e., d0 is the most significant digit). Then the value a_p is d0*p^{n-1} + d1*p^{n-2} + ... + dn-1.

So as p increases, the value a_p increases. So, for example, if a is '12', then in base p=3, a_p is 1*3 +2=5. In base p=4, it's 1*4+2=6. So larger p gives larger a_p.

But the sum a_p + b_p would also increase with p. Then, when converting this sum back to base p, how does the number of digits change?

Wait, let's think. For example, suppose a_p + b_p = S. When we represent S in base p, the number of digits is the number of digits required to write S in base p. As p increases, S increases, but the base we're writing in also increases. So the number of digits can vary in a non-monotonic way.

For example, consider a=1, b=1. Then p_min is 2. For p=2: a_p is 1, b_p is 1. Sum is 2, which in base 2 is '10' (2 digits). For p=3: sum is 2, which is '2' (1 digit). For p=4: sum is 2, which is '2' (1 digit). So the maximum is 2 (achieved at p=2). So the answer is 2, which matches the second example.

So, the code needs to iterate over all possible p >= p_min and compute for each p the sum a_p + b_p, then the number of digits when that sum is written in base p, then take the maximum.

But the question is: what is the maximum possible p that we need to check? Because if p can be arbitrarily large, then a_p and b_p would approach their original digit values (since for example, a=78 as digits '7' and '8' would be 7*p +8, which for p approaching infinity, the value a_p would be 7p +8. Similarly, b_p would be 8p +7. Sum is 15p +15. When written in base p, that's 15p +15 = 15(p +1) = 15 * (p) + 15. Wait, no. Let's compute this sum S = a_p + b_p = (7p +8) + (8p +7) = 15p +15. Then, converting S to base p:

S = 15(p+1) = 15p +15.

But in base p, 15p is 15 * p. But since 15 is greater than or equal to p (if p is say, 15, then 15 is equal to p, so 15p would be 15*15 = 225 in base 10. How to represent 15p +15 in base p?

Wait, for example, if p=16:

a_p is 7*16 +8 = 120, b_p is 8*16 +7 = 135. Sum is 255. Converting 255 to base 16 is FF (two digits). So length is 2. But for p=15, sum is 15*15 +15 = 240. 240 in base 15 is 110 (15² +15*1 +0 = 225 +15 = 240), which is 3 digits. For p=10, sum is 78+87=165 (base 10, so 165 is three digits). For p=9, sum is 7*9+8 + 8*9+7 = 71 + 79 = 150. 150 in base9: let's compute 9² is 81, 9²*1=81, 150-81=69. 69 /9=7, 7*9=63, remainder 6. So 1*81 +7*9 +6 = 1 7 6 → 176 (three digits).

So the maximum length here is 3.

But for larger p, the sum is 15p +15. Let's see how that is represented in base p.

For example, when p is 16: sum is 15*16 +15 = 255 → FF (base16) → 2 digits.

But what about when p is larger than 15? Let's take p=20. Then sum is 15*20 +15 = 315. Convert 315 to base 20: 20^2 is 400, which is more than 315. 20*15=300. 315-300=15. So digits are 15 (written as 'F' perhaps) and 15 → 'F' followed by 'F'? Wait, 20 *15 =300, 15 left. So 315 in base20 is 15*20^1 + 15*20^0. But since each digit must be less than p (20), 15 is allowed. So the digits are 15 and 15, so two digits. So length is 2.

What if p is 30? Sum is 15*30 +15 = 465. Convert to base30: 30*15=450, remainder 15. So 465 is 15 15, which is two digits. So length 2.

So for any p >=15, the sum is 15p +15. How many digits does that take in base p?

Let's think: 15p +15 = 15(p+1). Let's factor this as (p+1)*15. Let's write this in base p.

p+1 is equal to p +1. So 15*(p+1) is 15p +15. But when written in base p:

Each digit must be less than p.

Let's see: 15p is 15 * p^1. Then adding 15 *1 gives 15p +15. But in base p, 15p would be represented as 15 followed by 0. Then adding 15, we get 15 followed by 15. So the digits are 15 and 15. But 15 must be less than p. So for p>15, this is allowed. So the number has two digits. For p=15, 15 is allowed (since the digits can be up to p-1. Wait, no. The digits in a number must be less than the base. So in base p, digits can be 0 to p-1. So when p=15, 15 is not allowed. So in that case, 15p +15 would be 15*15 +15 = 240. Let's see how 240 is written in base15.

15^3 is 3375 which is larger than 240. 15^2 is 225. 240 /225 =1, remainder 15. 15 is equal to 15. Then, 1*15^2 + 15*15^1 +0*15^0. Wait, no. Wait, 240 = 1*15² + 15*15 +0. But 15 is not a valid digit in base15 (digits can be 0-14). So we have to carry over. So 15*15 is 225. So 240 = 1*15² + 15*15 +0. The 15*15 is equal to 1*15². So adding, 1*15² + 15*15 is (1+1)*15² = 2*15². Then, 240 = 2*15² +0. So in base15, that's written as 200. So three digits.

So for p=15, the sum is 240 (base10), which in base15 is 200 (three digits). So the length is 3.

But for p>15, the sum is 15p +15, which in base p is represented as two digits (15 and 15). But in base p, digits can be up to p-1. So for p>15, 15 is allowed as a digit (since 15 < p). So those two digits are valid. So the length is 2.

So for p >=16, the sum in base p is two digits. But for p=15, it's three. So the maximum length occurs at p=15 (and perhaps some other p's).

So in this case, the maximum length is 3, achieved at p=15, 10, 9, etc.

So the maximum can occur at any p starting from p_min up to some value. But how to find all possible p's and compute the sum's length?

The problem is that the sum can be very large. For example, when p is small (like p=2), the sum a_p + b_p can be a very large number (exponential in the number of digits). For example, if a is 1000 (digits 1,0,0,0), then in base 2, a_p is 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 +0*2 +0 =8. Similarly for b=1000. Sum is 16, which in base 2 is 10000 (5 digits). But for p=3, the sum would be 1000_p (1*3^3=27) plus same for b, sum 54. In base3, 54 is 2000 (since 3^3=27, 2*3^3 =54). So four digits. So the length is decreasing as p increases, but for small p, the length is larger.

Thus, the maximum length is achieved either at p_min or at some p not too far from p_min.

But how can we compute this for all possible p?

The problem is that for large a and b, the sum in base p can be very large, leading to handling very big numbers. But given that a and b are up to 1000 (so their digits are up to 9), let's think about the maximum possible p.

Wait, the input a and b are up to 1000, but when considered as digits in base p, their maximum digits are up to 9. So p_min is max_digit +1, which can be up to 9+1=10. Wait, but for example, if a is 999, its digits are 9,9,9. So p_min is 10. Then, for p=10, the sum is 999 + 999 (assuming both a and b are 999) in base10 is 1998. Which in base10 is 4 digits. For p=11, sum is 999_p (9*11^2 +9*11 +9 = 9*(121 +11 +1) = 9*133= 1197) plus same for b_p, sum 2394. Convert to base11: 2394 /11 = 217, remainder 7. 217/11 = 19 r 8. 19/11=1 r8. 1/11=0 r1. So digits are 1,8,8,7 → four digits. So the length is 4.

For p=10, the sum is 1998 → 1998 in base10 is 4 digits. For p=9, sum is 999 in base9 is 9*81 +9*9 +9 = 9*(81+9+1) =9*91=819. Sum 819*2=1638. Convert to base9: let's compute 9^3=729. 1638 /729 =2, remainder 1638-1458=180. 180 /81=2, rem 18. 18/9=2 rem 0. So digits 2 2 2 0 → four digits. So length 4. Hmm. So in this case, the maximum is 4.

But how to handle all possible p's efficiently?

The key is to note that the maximum possible sum is when p is at p_min. Because a_p and b_p are the largest possible when p is as small as possible (since p_min is the minimal possible p, and a_p and b_p increase with p). Wait, no. Wait, for a number like 78 (digits 7 and 8), p must be at least 9. Then, a_p in base9 is 7*9 +8 = 71. If p increases, say to 10, a_p is 7*10 +8 =78. So as p increases, the value a_p increases. So for higher p's, the sum a_p + b_p increases. Therefore, the sum increases as p increases, which would make the sum in base p have more digits. Wait, but when you convert a larger sum into a higher base, the number of digits can vary. For example, sum=255 in base16 is FF (2 digits), but in base10 it's 255 (3 digits). So higher base can lead to shorter or longer representations.

But in the case of a=1 and b=1, p_min is 2. For p=2, sum is 2 (10 in base2, 2 digits). For p=3, sum is 2 (2 in base3, 1 digit). So here, the maximum is achieved at p=2.

So the sum's length depends on both the sum and the base. So to find the maximum, we need to check all possible p starting from p_min upwards. But how high can p be?

Wait, but for p approaching infinity, the sum S = a_p + b_p = (sum of a's digits multiplied by p^something) + (sum of b's digits multiplied by p^something else). So for example, if a has digits d0, d1, ... dn-1, then a_p is d0*p^{n-1} + ... + dn-1. Similarly for b_p. So as p increases, the highest term dominates. So the sum S would be approximately (d0 + e0) * p^{max(n_a, n_b)-1}, where d0 and e0 are the leading digits of a and b, respectively. Then, when written in base p, the sum would have a leading digit (d0 + e0) divided by p, but since p is very large, d0 + e0 would be less than p (assuming that a and b have the same number of digits). So the sum would have a leading digit (d0 + e0) followed by other digits. But this is getting complicated.

But perhaps, for very large p, the sum S is (a_p + b_p) = O(p^{k}), where k is the maximum number of digits in a or b. Then, when written in base p, the sum would have approximately k digits. So the number of digits may stabilize once p is large enough. But for example, in the first example, a and b have two digits each. So for large p, a_p is 7p +8, b_p is 8p +7. Sum is 15p +15. When written in base p, that's 15p +15. How is that written? For p >15, 15p +15 is 15*(p+1). So in base p:

Let's compute S = 15(p+1) = 15p +15. In base p, 15p is 15 followed by 0, and adding 15 gives 15 followed by 15. So the digits are 15 and 15, which are allowed since p>15. So the sum is written as two digits. So for any p>15, the length is 2. So once p exceeds 15, the length is 2, which is less than the maximum of 3 (achieved at p=15, 10, 9, etc.). So in this case, the maximum is found in the lower p's.

So the maximum length is achieved in the lower p's. Thus, even if we loop through all p starting from p_min up to some upper limit, we can find the maximum.

But what's the upper limit? How high do we need to check p?

Let's think: For a given a and b, once p exceeds a certain value, the length of the sum in base p will be determined by the number of digits of the sum, which may stabilize. But to find the maximum possible length, perhaps the maximum occurs at p_min, or p_min+1, etc., and the lengths start decreasing as p increases.

But how can we know?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is achieved when p is the minimal possible (p_min) or when the sum has the maximum number of digits. For example, in the first example, the maximum is achieved at p=15, which is p_min (since max_digit is 8, p_min is 9?), wait wait. Wait, in the first example, the a is 78 (digits 7 and 8), so max_digit_a is 8. b is 87 (digits 8 and7), max_digit_b is 8. So p_min is 8+1=9. Then, for p=9, the sum is 7*9 +8 + 8*9 +7 = 71 +79=150. Which in base9 is 176 (3 digits). For p=10, sum is 78+87=165 (3 digits). For p=15, sum is 7*15+8=113, 8*15+7=127. Sum 240. In base15, 240 is 1*15² + 15*1 + 0 → 110 (3 digits). For p=16, sum is 7*16+8=120 + 8*16+7= 135 → sum 255, which in base16 is FF (2 digits). So the maximum is 3, achieved at p=9,10,15, etc.

So the maximum occurs at p_min (9), but also at higher p's.

So the code needs to check all possible p >= p_min, but how?

The problem is that the sum a_p + b_p can be very large, but the sum in base p can be computed by converting it to base p and counting digits. But converting large numbers to base p can be computationally expensive if the numbers are very large, but in our case, since a and b are up to 1000, their maximum digits are up to 4 (since 1000 has 4 digits). So the maximum number of digits for a and b is 4. So for a number with 4 digits, a_p would be up to d0*p^3 + d1*p^2 +d2*p +d3. For p up to, say, 1e5, this would be O(1e15) for a_p, which is manageable in Python's integers (as they can handle big numbers).

So the steps are:

1. For a and b, get their digits as lists of integers.

2. Compute p_min as max(max digit of a, max digit of b) +1.

3. For each p starting from p_min to some upper limit, compute a_p, b_p, sum them, then convert the sum to base p and count the digits. Keep track of the maximum length.

4. The upper limit is the maximum possible p where the sum's length could be larger than the current maximum. But how?

Alternatively, note that for p increasing beyond a certain point, the sum's length may start to decrease, but how can we know when to stop checking?

Alternatively, we can precompute all p up to some maximum value. What's the maximum possible p that can possibly yield a longer sum length?

In the worst case, when a and b are both 1, then p_min is 2. For p=2, the sum is 2 (10 in base2, 2 digits). For p=3, sum is 2 (2 in base3, 1 digit). So the maximum is achieved at p=2. So the code can stop there.

Another example: a=1, b=9. Then the digits of b are [9], so p_min is 10. For p=10, a_p=1, b_p=9. Sum 10. In base10, that's '10' → 2 digits. For p=11, sum is 1+9=10 → in base11, that's 'A' (assuming digits are 0-9 then A), but since the problem states that the digits are numeric characters, perhaps digits are written as numbers. Wait, the problem statement says that the length is the number of numeric characters. So the sum is converted into digits using digits 0-9, then if needed, letters? No. Wait, in positional numeral systems, each digit must be less than the base. So, for example, in base 16, digits are 0-15, which are written as 0-9 and A-F. But the problem statement mentions that the length is the number of numeric characters. But the problem says, "the length of a number should be understood as the number of numeric characters in it." So, for example, in base16, the number FF has two characters. So, the code must output the number of digits as per their string representation in base p, using digits 0-9, and possibly letters (but the problem's examples use digits only). Wait, but the problem's examples use only digits. For example, in the first example, the sum in base15 is 11015, which is written as three digits. So perhaps in this problem, the base can be up to 10, but that's not the case. Because p can be larger than 10, but digits would have to be represented as numbers. For example, in base16, the digits 10-15 are typically represented as letters, but the problem statement says "numeric characters". So perhaps the problem assumes that the digits are represented as numbers (possibly multi-digit?), which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that each digit in the sum's representation is a single numeric character. But that's not possible for bases larger than 10, unless the problem is considering some other representation.

But the problem statement says, "the length of a number should be understood as the number of numeric characters in it." So for example, in base15, the digits can be 0-14. So when written as numeric characters, perhaps each digit is written in base10 (so 10 is written as '10'), but that's not possible because each digit must be a single character. Therefore, this suggests that the problem considers that the base p is such that all digits in the sum are single numeric digits. But how is that possible?

Ah, no. The problem statement says that the sum is written in base p. Each digit in the sum must be between 0 and p-1. So for example, in base15, the sum can have digits 0-14. Each of these digits is a single character (assuming letters are allowed). But the problem says "numeric characters". So perhaps the problem is considering that the digits are written as numbers, each as a separate character, even if they are multi-digit. But that's not possible. For example, the digit 14 in base15 would require two characters, but that's not allowed. Therefore, I think the problem must be considering that digits in bases higher than 10 are not considered. But that can't be, since the first example has p=15 and the sum is 11015, which is three digits (1, 1, 0). So in this case, the digits are 1, 1, 0. So the problem allows digits up to p-1, but when written in the number, each digit is a single numeric character. Wait, but 15's digits are 0-14. How can they be represented as single numeric characters? Unless the problem is assuming that the digits are written in base 10, but that's conflicting.

So perhaps the problem's examples have a mistake. But in the first example, the sum in base15 is written as 11015, which has three digits, each being a single digit. So, perhaps the problem uses digits in the conventional way (for bases up to 10), and for higher bases, digits are represented as letters. But the problem statement says "numeric characters", which suggests that letters are not considered. So perhaps the problem is considering that the sum is written in base p, but each digit is a single numeric character. Which implies that the base p must be <=10. But this is not the case, as in the first example, the base is 15. So there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the problem's examples are illustrative, and the actual digits are considered as their numerical values. For example, in base15, the digits can be 0-14. So when converting the sum to base15, each digit is a single digit (even if represented as a number). For example, 14 is written as '14' which is two characters, but that's not possible. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem uses a different approach: when the sum is computed, the number is represented in base p, and the length is the number of digits in that representation, regardless of how they are written. For example, in base15, the sum is 110, which is three digits, each of which is 1, 1, 0, which are valid digits (less than 15). So the problem's examples are correct.

Therefore, the code must compute the sum in base p and count the number of digits required to represent that sum in base p, treating each digit as a single entity, regardless of its value. For example, if the sum is 240 in base15, which is 1*15² + 1*15 + 0 → digits 1,1,0 → three digits.

So for any p >= p_min, the code must compute the sum, convert it to base p, and count the digits. The maximum length is the answer.

But how to compute a_p and b_p?

The code can process each a and b as strings to get their digits. Then, for a given p, compute a_p as the sum of each digit multiplied by p^(position). For example, a is '78', digits [7,8], p=9. a_p = 7*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 63 +8=71.

So, the code can compute a_p by iterating over each digit and multiplying by the appropriate power of p.

But wait, how to get the digits? For example, the input a is given as an integer. So to get the digits, the code must convert a to a string, then each character to an integer. For example, a=78 → string '78' → digits [7,8].

So steps for the code:

1. Read a and b as integers.

2. Convert a and b to strings to extract their digits.

3. For each digit in a and b, check if they are valid (digits are 0-9). Then find the maximum digit for a (max_a) and for b (max_b). The minimal possible p is max(max_a, max_b) + 1.

4. For each p starting from p_min up to some upper limit, compute a_p and b_p, sum them, then convert the sum to base p, and count the digits. Keep track of the maximum.

But how to compute a_p and b_p efficiently.

Let's think about the code:

For example, digits_a = list of digits in a, as integers.

To compute a_p:

value = 0

for digit in digits_a:

    value = value * p + digit

This is a standard way to compute the value of a number in base p. For example, 78 in base10: 7*10 +8 =78.

So yes, this works.

So the code can compute a_p and b_p using this method.

Then sum_ab = a_p + b_p.

Then, convert sum_ab to base p and count the number of digits.

But how to convert sum_ab to base p.

The standard way is to repeatedly divide by p and collect the remainders. But when sum_ab is zero, it's a special case.

For example, sum_ab =0 → but since a and b are at least 1, sum_ab is at least 2 (when a and b are 1 in base p=2, sum is 2 in base2, which is 10 → 2 digits). So sum_ab can't be zero.

So the code for converting sum_ab to base p and counting digits:

def count_digits(n, p):

    if n ==0:

        return 1

    count =0

    while n >0:

        count +=1

        n = n //p

    return count

So for example, n=240, p=15:

240 //15 =16 → count 1

16//15 =1 → count 2

1//15 =0 → count3.

So returns 3.

Yes, correct.

So the code steps:

Read a and b.

Process digits of a and b.

Compute p_min.

Loop p from p_min to some upper limit.

For each p:

    compute a_p.

    compute b_p.

    sum_ab = a_p +b_p.

    compute digits = count_digits(sum_ab, p).

    keep track of the maximum.

But what is the upper limit for p?

As discussed earlier, for p beyond a certain value, the digits of the sum may stabilize. But how to find that?

But for the given problem, a and b can have up to 4 digits (since the maximum input is 1000 → which is '1000' → 4 digits). So for example, a_p is up to 9*p^3 + 9*p^2 + 9*p +9. For p=1e5, this would be 9*(1e15) + ... which is a very large number, but in Python, handling big integers is manageable.

But for a and b with up to 4 digits, the maximum sum_ab would be (when p is minimal, say 2):

For a= 9999 (digits 9,9,9,9) → p_min is 10.

a_p =9*10^3 +9*10^2 +9*10 +9= 9999.

sum_ab = 9999 * 2 = 19998.

In base10, this is 5 digits. For p=11, sum_ab is 9*11^3 +9*11^2 +9*11 +9 + same for b → which is 9*(1331 + 121 +11 +1) = 9*1464= 13176 ×2=26352. Converted to base11 → 26352 in base11: let's see. 11^4 is 14641. 26352 /14641=1, remainder 26352-14641=11711. 11711/1331=8, rem 11711-8*1331= 11711-10648=1063. 1063/121=8, rem 1063-8*121= 1063-968=95. 95/11=8 rem 95-88=7. So digits 1 8 8 8 7 → 5 digits. So same as base10.

But for higher p's, like p=1e5, sum_ab would be 9*(1e5^3 + ... ) for each a and b, sum would be very large. But converting to base p would require division by p. For example, sum_ab in base p is a number where the leading digit is (sum_ab // p^k), where k is the highest power. But for very large p, sum_ab is a_p + b_p = (d0*p^{n-1} + ...) + (e0*p^{m-1} + ...). The highest term would be d0*p^{n-1} + e0*p^{m-1}. If n>m, then the leading term is d0*p^{n-1} → sum_ab is O(p^{n-1}).

When converting sum_ab to base p, the number of digits would be n digits. For example, if a has 4 digits (d0 d1 d2 d3), then a_p is d0*p^3 + ... +d3. For very large p, this is approximately d0*p^3. sum_ab would be d0*p^3 + e0*p^3 (if b also has 4 digits), leading to (d0+e0)*p^3. Converted to base p, this would be (d0+e0) followed by three zeros → four digits. But if d0+e0 >=p, then we have to carry over. For example, if d0+e0 = p, then the sum would be 1*p^4 + 0*p^3 + ... → five digits.

So in this case, the number of digits can vary depending on the sum of the leading digits. But for large p, leading digits would be sum to less than p. So for example, if a and b have leading digits 9 each, then sum_ab's leading digits would be 18. For p>18, the sum would be 18*p^3 + ... → which in base p is 18 followed by other digits, but 18 < p. So two digits for the leading term. But the overall number of digits would be 4 (assuming a and b have four digits each). So sum_ab in base p would have 4 digits. But for p=18, 18 is allowed as a digit. So sum_ab in base18 would be 18*p^3 → written as 18 followed by three zeros. But 18 is not allowed in base18. So this would require a carry over. 18*p^3 = 1*p^4 + 0*p^3. So the number becomes 10000 (5 digits). So for p=18, the sum_ab would have 5 digits.

But this is getting complicated. So for very large p, the sum_ab may have a certain number of digits. But how to know when to stop checking?

Alternatively, since for the maximum length, it's likely achieved when p is as small as possible, but in some cases, like the first example, the maximum is achieved at higher p's (like p=15). So we need to check all possible p's up to a certain value.

But what is the upper bound?

In the first example, the maximum is achieved at p=15. For p>15, the length is 2. So the code would need to check up to p=15 to find the maximum. So perhaps the upper limit can be the sum of the maximum digits of a and b plus some buffer. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can precompute all possible p from p_min up to p_min + 1000. But this would be inefficient if p_min is 2 and we have to check 1000 p's. But since the code is written in Python and the constraints are small (a and b up to 1000), even checking up to p=1e5 would be manageable. But in practice, for each p, the code does O(d) operations, where d is the number of digits in a and b. For a and b up to 1000, the digits are up to 4, so each iteration is O(1). So even for 1e5 iterations, it's O(1e5) steps. Which is manageable.

But how to determine the upper bound for p?

An alternative approach is to realize that the maximum length is achieved either when p is p_min, or when the sum of the digits in a and b's least significant positions causes a carry that propagates all the way. But this is not easy to model.

Alternatively, think about the maximum possible length. For a and b with m and n digits respectively, the sum in base p can have up to max(m, n) +1 digits. For example, adding 999 (3 digits) and 999 (3 digits) in base10 gives 1998 (4 digits). So the maximum possible length is up to 4 in this case.

But for some p, the sum can have more digits. For example, a=1 and b=1 in base2: sum is 10 (2 digits). So the maximum is 2.

But for a=9999 and b=9999 in base10: sum is 19998 (5 digits). So the maximum possible length is 5.

But how to find the maximum possible p that could give a longer length?

Alternatively, note that for a and b with digits d0, d1, ... dn-1 and e0, e1, ... em-1, the sum in base p will have a number of digits equal to the floor(log_p (sum_ab)) +1. But sum_ab is a_p + b_p. Which for p increasing, sum_ab increases, but log_p sum_ab increases as well. But the number of digits is floor(log_p sum_ab) +1. But how this behaves with increasing p?

For example, sum_ab = a_p +b_p = (d0 p^{k-1} + ...) + (e0 p^{l-1} + ...). For p very large, the sum_ab is approximately (d0 + e0) p^{max(k,l)-1}. So log_p sum_ab is approximately max(k,l)-1 + log_p (d0 + e0). For large p, log_p (d0 +e0) approaches zero. So log_p sum_ab ≈ max(k,l) -1. Then, floor(log_p sum_ab) +1 is max(k,l). So the number of digits is max(k,l). But in reality, for large p, sum_ab is (d0 +e0) p^{max(k,l)-1} + lower terms. So when written in base p, it would be (d0+e0) followed by zeros, leading to digits count of max(k,l) if d0+e0 <p, or max(k,l)+1 if d0+e0 >=p.

But for p greater than d0 +e0, the digits would be (d0+e0) followed by lower digits, so the number of digits is max(k,l). For p less than or equal to d0 +e0, the digits would have an additional carry.

But how often does this happen?

For example, if a is 99 and b is 99. Then, for p=100, sum_ab is 99 +99 =198. In base100, that's 1 followed by 98 → two digits. But for p=99, sum_ab is 99*99 +99 + 99*99 +99 = 99*99*2 +198 = 19602 + 198 = 19800. 19800 in base99: 19800 /99^2 = 19800 /9801 = 2.02 → 2*99^2 =19602, remainder 198. Then 198/99=2. So digits 2,0,198-2*99=0. So digits 2 0 0 → three digits. So for p=99, the length is 3, which is larger than for p=100 (2 digits). But for p=99, p_min is 9+1=10 (since the digits of a and b are 9 and 9). So this would be considered.

So the maximum length can be achieved for p's larger than p_min but still within a certain range.

So the code must check all p's >= p_min. But how to find the upper bound?

Alternatively, the maximum possible sum_ab is when p is very large. But for p larger than sum_ab, the sum_ab is represented as a single digit. But sum_ab is a_p +b_p, which for large p is O(p^{max(k,l)}). So for p larger than sum_ab, sum_ab would be written as a single digit. But sum_ab is larger than p, so that's not possible. So this line of thinking is not helpful.

Alternatively, we can notice that the number of digits in sum_ab for base p can be up to len(str(sum_ab)) when p is 10, but for other bases, it can be larger or smaller.

But perhaps the maximum possible number of digits is when p is as small as possible. For example, when p=p_min, sum_ab is as small as possible, and when converted to base p, may have more digits.

But this is not always the case. For example, a=1, b=1, p_min=2: sum is 2 (10 in base2 → 2 digits). For p=3: sum is 2 (2 in base3 → 1 digit). So maximum is 2.

Another example: a=78, b=87. p_min=9. For p=9, sum is 71 +79=150. In base9: 150 /9^2= 150/81=1, remainder 69. 69/9=7, remainder 6. So 176 → 3 digits. For p=10: sum 78+87=165 → 3 digits. For p=15: sum 113 +127=240 → 110 (3 digits). For p=16: sum 120+135=255 → FF (2 digits). So maximum is 3.

So in this case, the maximum is achieved for p starting from p_min up to p=15. So how to determine the upper bound for p?

It's not obvious, so perhaps the code must check all possible p >= p_min up to some large value. But how?

An alternative approach is to realize that the sum_ab's length in base p can be up to len(str(sum_ab)) when p is 10. But for other p's, it's possible to have longer lengths.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, sum_ab=2 (base2: 10 → 2 digits; base3: 2 → 1 digit; base4: 2 → 1 digit, etc.)

So the code must check all possible p's >= p_min.

But given that a and b are up to 1000, and their digits are up to 4, the sum_ab can be up to:

For a=9999 and b=9999 (digits 9 each), p_min is 10. a_p =9999, b_p=9999. sum_ab=19998. Converting to base10 gives 19998 (5 digits). For p=10, this is the maximum possible length. For larger p's, the sum_ab increases, but converting to base p may have fewer digits.

For example, p=1e5:

sum_ab =9*(1e5)^3 + ... ×2. Which is a huge number, but converting to base1e5 would be:

sum_ab = 9*1e5^3 × 2 = 1.8e16. In base1e5, this is 1.8e16 / (1e5)^k. For k=4, (1e5)^4 =1e20. sum_ab is 1.8e16 < 1e20. k=3, (1e5)^3=1e15. sum_ab=1.8e16 / 1e15 =18. So 18*1e15 + ... So the digits would be 18 followed by zeros. Since 18 <1e5, it's allowed. So the number of digits is 4. So for p=1e5, sum_ab's length is 4.

But in p=10, the sum_ab's length was 5.

So the maximum is achieved at p=10.

So in general, the maximum length is achieved at p_min or a p close to it.

So the code can iterate p from p_min up to some upper bound, such as p_min + 1e4, but this would be computationally feasible.

But given that a and b are small (up to 1000), even iterating up to p=1e5 is manageable. But for each p, we need to compute a_p and b_p, which for 4 digits each is 4 steps per number, plus converting the sum to base p, which is O(log_p sum_ab) steps. For sum_ab up to 2e6 (for example), converting to base p=2 gives log2(2e6) ~21 steps. Which is manageable.

But given that a and b are up to 1000, and their digits are up to 4, the maximum sum_ab when p is p_min=10 (for example) is a=9999 and b=9999, sum_ab=19998. Which in base10 is 5 digits. For p=9, sum_ab=71+79=150 → 3 digits. So for p_min=9, the maximum length is 3.

So the code can iterate p from p_min up to sum_ab's value. But sum_ab can be very large. So this is not feasible.

Alternative idea: the maximum possible length is achieved when p is such that sum_ab is the largest possible, which is when p is p_min, but sum_ab is converted into the base with the smallest possible base, leading to the longest possible representation.

Wait, but sum_ab increases with p. So when p is larger, sum_ab is larger, but the base is also larger, which can lead to shorter representations. So the maximum length may be achieved for p_min.

But in the first example, p_min is 9, and the maximum is achieved at p=15 as well.

So how to handle this.

Another approach: precompute all possible p's up to the maximum possible sum_ab when p=p_min. For example, when p=p_min, sum_ab can be up to (for a and b with 4 digits) 9999 + 9999 =19998. So for p=10, sum_ab=19998. The maximum possible p to check is 19998, but that's a lot.

But for sum_ab=19998, the maximum possible number of digits in any base is log2(19998) ~14.3 → 14 digits. So the code must check all p's from p_min up to 19998, which is 19998 - p_min iterations. For p_min=10, that's 19988 iterations.

But for Python, even 1e5 iterations are manageable within the time limit.

But given that the time limit is 2 seconds, and each iteration is O(1), even 1e6 iterations are possible.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Compute p_min.

Iterate p from p_min to a certain upper limit. For each p:

    compute a_p and b_p.

    sum_ab = a_p + b_p.

    compute digits = count_digits(sum_ab, p).

    keep track of the maximum.

The upper limit can be sum_ab when p=p_min. Because for p larger than sum_ab, sum_ab in base p is represented as two digits: the first digit is sum_ab //p and the second is sum_ab %p. But sum_ab >=p, so sum_ab //p >=1. So the number of digits is at least 2, which is less than the possible maximum digits when p is smaller.

But perhaps not. For example, sum_ab=19998 when p=10 has 5 digits. But for p=19998, sum_ab is a_p=78 (digits 7 and8) → but wait, p must be at least 9. So for p=19998, a_p is 7*19998 +8 =139994. b_p is 8*19998 +7=159991. sum_ab=139994 +159991=299985. Convert to base19998: 299985 //19998 =14, remainder 299985 - 14*19998=299985-279972=20013. 20013//19998=1, remainder 15. So digits are 14, 1, 15. Which is 3 digits. So the code would need to check p=19998 and find 3 digits, but this is less than the maximum of 5.

So the code can iterate p from p_min to sum_ab_p_min (sum_ab when p is p_min) and find the maximum.

But sum_ab_p_min can be very large. For example, if a and b are 9999 (digits 9,9,9,9), p_min is 10. a_p=9999, sum_ab=19998. So the upper limit would be 19998. For each p from 10 to 19998, compute sum_ab and digits. But this is 19998-10+1=19989 iterations. For each iteration, processing is O(1) (since the digits are up to 4). So 2e4 iterations are manageable.

But in practice, the sum_ab_p_min can be up to 19998, but for larger p's, sum_ab would be larger. For example, p=19998, sum_ab is 9999_p + 9999_p = (9*19998^3 + ...) + same → which is a very large number, but when converted to base p, the digits may be very few.

But how to compute the upper limit for p.

Alternative approach: iterate p from p_min up to sum_ab_p_min, but sum_ab_p_min can be very large.

But wait, sum_ab_p_min is a_p (p_min) + b_p (p_min).

For example, a=78, p_min=9. a_p=7*9 +8=71. b_p=8*9+7=79. sum_ab=150. So iterate p from 9 up to 150.

But for p=150, sum_ab would be 71+79=150. Converted to base150: 1 digit. So the maximum in this range is 3.

But this requires iterating up to 150. Which is 142 iterations.

But if a and b are 9999, sum_ab_p_min=19998. So the code would need to loop up to 19998 iterations, which is 19998-10+1=19989 iterations. For each iteration, compute a_p, b_p, sum_ab, and count digits. For a and b with 4 digits, a_p is computed in 4 steps, same for b_p. So each iteration takes about 8 steps. 19989 iterations would take 159912 steps, which is acceptable.

But how to compute sum_ab_p_min:

sum_ab_p_min = a_p (p_min) + b_p (p_min).

So the upper limit can be sum_ab_p_min.

So the code can compute the upper limit as sum_ab_p_min.

Thus, the code would proceed as follows:

1. Read a and b as integers.

2. For each of a and b, extract their digits as a list of integers.

3. Compute p_min as the maximum digit in a and b, plus 1.

4. Compute a_p_min and b_p_min.

5. sum_ab_p_min = a_p_min + b_p_min.

6. Iterate p from p_min to sum_ab_p_min, inclusive.

7. For each p, compute a_p and b_p.

8. sum_ab = a_p + b_p.

9. Compute the number of digits in sum_ab when written in base p.

10. Keep track of the maximum number of digits.

But wait, why iterate up to sum_ab_p_min? Because for p larger than sum_ab_p_min, sum_ab would be a_p + b_p, which for p > p_min, a_p and b_p are larger than a_p_min and b_p_min. So sum_ab can be larger than sum_ab_p_min. So the upper limit as sum_ab_p_min is incorrect.

For example, if a=78 and b=87, p_min=9. sum_ab_p_min=71+79=150. For p=10, a_p=78, b_p=87, sum_ab=165. Which is larger than sum_ab_p_min. So the upper limit of sum_ab_p_min is incorrect. Thus, this approach is invalid.

So the initial idea is flawed. The code must find another way to determine the upper bound.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to iterate p from p_min to a very large upper bound, say 1e6, and see. But this would not work for very large a and b.

Alternatively, the code can iterate p from p_min up to p_max, where p_max is sum_ab_p_min. But this is also not correct.

Alternatively, realize that for p larger than sum_ab, the sum_ab in base p will be represented as two digits: sum_ab //p and sum_ab %p. So the number of digits is 2, unless sum_ab < p, in which case it's 1. But sum_ab can be larger than p_max.

But sum_ab = a_p +b_p, which for p increasing, a_p and b_p increase, so sum_ab increases. So for p larger than sum_ab_p_min, sum_ab can be larger than p, but the code would still need to compute digits for each p.

But this is not feasible.

Thus, the code must find a way to compute the maximum possible length without iterating up to a very large p.

But given time constraints, perhaps the code should proceed by iterating p from p_min to sum_ab_p_min plus some buffer.

But for the given problem constraints (a and b up to 1000), even iterating up to 1e5 is manageable.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

1. Process a and b into digits.

2. Compute p_min.

3. Compute a_p for p_min, b_p for p_min.

4. sum_ab_p_min = a_p +b_p.

5. Compute the upper limit as max_p = max(p_min, sum_ab_p_min) + 1e5.

But this is not a guarantee.

Alternatively, the code can compute up to p=1e5. But for a and b up to 1000, sum_ab for p=1e5 is 1000_p + 1000_p = 1e3 *1e5 + 0*1e5^2 + ... (but the digits of 1000 are 1,0,0,0). So a_p = 1*1e5^3 = 1e15. sum_ab = 2e15. Converting to base p=1e5:

2e15 = 2e15 / (1e5)^k. 1e5^3 is 1e15. So 2e15 /1e15 = 2. So digits are 2 followed by three zeros → 4 digits.

So for p=1e5, sum_ab is 4 digits. But in p_min=2 (for a=1000, b=1000), sum_ab for p=2 is 8 +8=16 → 10000 (5 digits). So the maximum is 5.

So for this case, the code would need to iterate up to p=1e5, but the maximum is achieved at p=2.

Thus, the code must check all p's >= p_min. But the code must find a way to compute the maximum possible p.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can iterate p from p_min up to sum_ab_p_min. But this is not correct.

Alternative approach: For each p >= p_min, the number of digits of sum_ab in base p can be at least 1. So, the code must find the maximum possible length, which is potentially up to the maximum possible digits in any base.

But how to find that.

Alternatively, note that the maximum possible length is achieved when sum_ab is the smallest possible for a given p, leading to more digits. For example, sum_ab =p^k -1, which is written as k digits of (p-1).

But this is not directly helpful.

But given that the code needs to process all possible p's from p_min upwards, and given that a and b are small, perhaps the code can safely iterate p up to 1e5, which is manageable.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

Read a and b.

Convert them to strings to extract digits.

Compute p_min.

Iterate p from p_min to 1e5.

For each p:

   compute a_p and b_p.

   sum_ab = a_p +b_p.

   compute digits = count_digits(sum_ab, p).

   update maximum.

But what if the maximum is achieved for p larger than 1e5?

But given the time constraints of 2 seconds, and the code being written in Python, iterating up to 1e5 may be manageable.

But let's test the code's speed.

For each iteration:

- Compute a_p and b_p by iterating over their digits. For 4 digits, this is 4 steps each.

- Compute sum_ab.

- Compute the digits of sum_ab in base p.

Which for sum_ab up to 1e15, converting to base p=1e5 would take 5 steps (1e15 is 1e5^3*1e0 → 3 steps).

So each iteration is O(1) steps.

1e5 iterations would take 1e5 * 10 steps → 1e6 operations. Which is manageable.

Thus, the code can proceed with this approach.

Now, let's draft the code.

First, read a and b:

a, b = map(int, input().split())

Then, convert a and b to strings to get their digits.

digits_a = list(map(int, str(a)))
digits_b = list(map(int, str(b)))

Compute max_a = max(digits_a), max_b = max(digits_b).

p_min = max(max_a, max_b) + 1

Then, for each p from p_min to, say, 2*1e5:

max_length = 0

for p in range(p_min, 2*10**5 +1):

    # compute a_p

    a_p = 0

    for d in digits_a:

        a_p = a_p * p + d

    # compute b_p

    b_p = 0

    for d in digits_b:

        b_p = b_p * p + d

    sum_ab = a_p + b_p

    # compute digits count

    if sum_ab ==0:

        count =1

    else:

        count =0

        n = sum_ab

        while n >0:

            count +=1

            n = n //p

    if count > max_length:

        max_length = count

But this loop up to 2e5 may take a lot of time. For example, if p_min is 2 and we have to iterate up to 2e5, that's 199999 iterations. Each iteration has loops for digits and for converting sum_ab to base p.

But for digits in a and b being up to 4 digits, the loops for a_p and b_p are 4 iterations each, and the loop for count is O( log_p sum_ab ), which for p=2 and sum_ab= 2e5 is about 18 steps.

So for each iteration:

- 4+4 steps for a_p and b_p.

- 18 steps for count.

Total per iteration: 26 steps.

For 2e5 iterations: 5.2e6 steps. Which should be manageable.

But in Python, even 1e7 steps can be handled in 1-2 seconds.

But perhaps the code can be optimized.

But given the problem constraints, this approach should work.

But what if the maximum occurs for a p larger than 2e5? For example, if a and b are 1, then p_min is 2. The code would iterate p up to 2e5. For p=2e5, sum_ab=1+1=2. converted to base p, that's 2, which is 1 digit. But the maximum is at p=2, with 2 digits. So the code would capture this.

But in some other cases, perhaps the maximum is achieved for p larger than 2e5. For example, a=1 and b=1. Then sum_ab for p=2 is 2 (10 → 2 digits). For p=2e5, sum_ab=2, which is 1 digit. So the maximum is correctly captured.

Thus, the code's upper bound of 2e5 is sufficient.

But how to determine that upper bound?

Alternatively, compute up to sum_ab_p_min. sum_ab_p_min is the sum of a and b in p_min.

For example, a=78, p_min=9:

sum_ab_p_min=71+79=150.

So iterate p from 9 to 150.

Which is 142 iterations.

But this code would miss p=15, which is larger than 150. Wait, no. 150 is larger than 15. So p=15 is included in the range 9 to 150.

Wait, sum_ab_p_min=150. So the code would iterate p from 9 to 150.

For p=15, a_p=7*15+8=113, b_p=8*15+7=127. sum_ab=240.

Converted to base15:

240 //15 =16 → count 1.

16//15=1 → count 2.

1//15=0 → count 3.

So digits is 3.

Which is captured.

Thus, the code's upper bound of sum_ab_p_min is correct.

So the code should iterate p from p_min to sum_ab_p_min.

But sum_ab_p_min can be computed as follows:

Compute a_p_min and b_p_min.

sum_ab_p_min = a_p_min + b_p_min.

But sum_ab_p_min can be very large. For example, a=9999 and b=9999, p_min=10. sum_ab_p_min=19998.

So iterate p from 10 to 19998.

But 19998 iterations is a lot.

But wait, sum_ab_p_min can be very large. For example, a=9999, digits are 9,9,9,9. p_min=10. a_p is 9999. sum_ab_p_min=19998. So iterate p from 10 to 19998.

But for each p in this range, a_p and b_p are computed as 9*p^3 +9*p^2 +9*p +9 + same for b_p. Which is 2*(9*p^3 +9*p^2 +9*p +9).

But for p=10, sum_ab=19998. For p=19998, sum_ab is 9*(19998^3 + 19998^2 +19998 +1) *2 → which is a huge number, but converting to base p=19998 would take 4 digits.

But the code must compute this sum_ab for each p, which is time-consuming.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find that the maximum length is achieved when the sum_ab in base p has the maximum number of digits. This happens when the sum_ab is as small as possible for a given p. But I'm not sure.

Another observation: For a given p, the sum_ab is a_p +b_p. When written in base p, the number of digits is the number of digits of (a_p +b_p) in base p.

But a_p and b_p are the values of a and b in base p. So a_p = digits_a[0]*p^{k-1} + ... + digits_a[-1].

Similarly for b_p.

Thus, sum_ab = a_p +b_p.

When written in base p, sum_ab's digits are determined by how much carries happen.

But the code can't compute this without actual conversion.

Thus, the problem seems to require iterating over possible p's.

But for large p's, the sum_ab can be very large, making the code's approach of iterating up to sum_ab_p_min unfeasible.

Thus, the code must find a mathematical way to compute the maximum possible length without iterating.

Another observation: For a given p, the number of digits of sum_ab in base p is floor(log_p sum_ab) +1.

To maximize the length, we need to maximize this value.

log_p sum_ab = ln(sum_ab)/ln(p)

The function log_p sum_ab decreases as p increases. So to maximize floor(log_p sum_ab) +1, we need to minimize p.

Thus, the maximum length is achieved when p is as small as possible.

Thus, the code only needs to check p =p_min.

But this contradicts the first example, where the maximum is also achieved at p=15.

Wait, the first example's p_min is 9. For p=9, the length is 3. For p=15, it's also 3. So the maximum is achieved at p_min, but also at higher p's. So the code's assumption that the maximum is at p_min is incorrect.

Thus, this approach is also invalid.

Thus, the problem is challenging.

Alternative idea: for each p, the number of digits is floor(log_p (a_p +b_p)) +1.

But a_p and b_p depend on p.

But a_p and b_p are increasing functions of p. So sum_ab increases with p.

But log_p sum_ab = ln(sum_ab)/ln(p).

As p increases, sum_ab increases, but p also increases. It's not clear how this ratio behaves.

But for example, when p increases, sum_ab increases as O(p^{k}), where k is the number of digits of a and b. log_p sum_ab =k + log_p (d0 + e0), which approaches k as p increases.

Thus, floor(log_p sum_ab)+1 approaches k+1.

But this is for very large p.

Thus, the maximum number of digits is likely achieved at p_min, but not necessarily.

Thus, the code must check all possible p's up to a certain limit.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can loop p from p_min up to p_min + 1000. For example, for p in p_min to p_min+1000.

But this may miss the maximum for some cases.

Alternatively, the code can loop p from p_min up to p_min + the sum of the digits of a and b.

But this is not based on any solid reasoning.

Thus, after much thought, the best approach is to implement the code that iterates p from p_min up to sum_ab_p_min, but this may not be feasible for large sum_ab_p_min.

But for the given problem constraints, perhaps the code can proceed with this approach.

But sum_ab_p_min can be very large. For example, a=9999, b=9999, p_min=10. sum_ab_p_min=19998. Iterate up to 19998 iterations.

But for each iteration, compute a_p and b_p.

For example, for p=19998:

a_p is 9*19998^3 +9*19998^2 +9*19998 +9.

This is a huge number, but in Python, integers can handle it.

But how much time would it take to compute a_p and b_p for each p?

For each p, a_p is computed by iterating over the digits of a and multiplying by p each time.

For 4 digits, this is 4 multiplications and additions. For each p, it's O(1) time.

Thus, the code can proceed.

Thus, the code is as follows:

Read a and b.

Extract their digits.

Compute p_min.

Compute a_p_min and b_p_min.

sum_ab_p_min = a_p_min + b_p_min.

Iterate p from p_min to sum_ab_p_min.

For each p:

   compute a_p and b_p.

   sum_ab = a_p +b_p.

   count the number of digits of sum_ab in base p.

   update max_length.

Thus, the code is:

But how to handle cases where sum_ab_p_min is very large.

For example, a=9999 and b=9999, sum_ab_p_min=19998. The loop would run from 10 to 19998, which is 19989 iterations. Each iteration takes O(1) steps.

This is manageable.

But for a=1 and b=1, sum_ab_p_min=2. The loop runs from 2 to 2. So 1 iteration.

Thus, the code should work.
