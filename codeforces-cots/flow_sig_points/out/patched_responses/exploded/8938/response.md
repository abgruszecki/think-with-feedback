Okay, let's see. The problem is a bit complicated. So we have this initial string 'a's, and we need to apply some operations using the given strings to turn it into a target string b. Each operation uses a string x, which modifies each character of a by adding (the position of x's character in the alphabet, which is 0 for a, 1 for b, etc.) multiplied by the number of times we use x. Wait, no. Wait, each time we use a string x, each character in a is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet as many times as the corresponding character in x's position. Oh right. For example, if x's character is 'c' (which is position 2), then the a's character is shifted forward by 2 steps. But since after 'e' comes 'a', the shifts are modulo 5. But each time you use the string x, you apply the shift once. But wait, when you use a string x, each character in a is shifted by (x's char's position) steps, and each use of x counts as a separate application. But the key point is that the order of applying the strings doesn't matter. Because each application of a string x adds a certain delta to each position. So the total delta for each position is the sum of the individual deltas from each string used. But since each string in a group is the same, using k copies of a group's string would contribute k * (delta of that string) to each position.

But wait, the groups are such that each group has four identical strings. So for each group, we can choose how many times to use the string (from 0 to 4, inclusive). Because each group has four copies, so the count per group is how many times you use that string (each use is one copy). So for group i, the number of times you use the string can be 0,1,2,3,4. So for each group, the choice is the count of uses, and each count contributes (count) * (the per-position shifts from that group's string) to the total shift in each position. Then, the sum of all these across all groups must equal the required delta (the difference between the target b and the initial a's) modulo 5 for each position.

So the problem reduces to: for each target b, compute the number of ways to choose counts (k1, k2, ..., kn) where each ki is between 0 and 4, inclusive, such that for each position j (from 0 to m-1), the sum of (ki * (s_i_j)) over all i groups is congruent to (b_j - a_j) mod 5. Since a is all 'a's (0), the required delta for each position j is (b_j_char - 'a') mod 5. Let's call this required_deltas[j].

So the problem is now a system of linear equations modulo 5. Each group contributes a vector (the shifts for each position in its string) multiplied by ki (0-4). We need the sum of all group vectors multiplied by their ki to equal the required_deltas.

But solving this system and counting the number of solutions (ki in 0-4) is the core of the problem. The answer for each query is the number of such solutions modulo 1e9+7.

The constraints are n up to 500, m up to 500. For each query, the m positions are the variables. So we need to model this as a system of linear equations over GF(5), with variables ki (each can take 0-4, which is equivalent to mod 5). Wait, but the variables ki can be 0-4. But in the equations, ki is multiplied by their coefficients (the per-group s_i_j). So each equation is sum (ki * s_i_j) ≡ required_deltas_j mod 5, for each j. The variables are ki (n variables) each with possible values 0-4. But since each equation is mod 5, and ki is multiplied by s_i_j, which is a coefficient in 0-4 (since s_i_j is a letter 'a' to 'e' mapped to 0-4), then each ki can be considered modulo 5. However, the constraints on ki are that they are 0 ≤ ki ≤4, i.e., exactly the possible residues mod 5. So the problem reduces to solving the system of equations over GF(5), and the number of solutions is the product over the possible values of the variables in the solution space, considering that each variable can take any value in its possible residues (0-4) that satisfy the equations.

Wait, no. Because the variables ki are in 0-4, which is exactly the possible residues mod 5. So each variable ki can take any value in GF(5), but since the equations are mod 5, the possible solutions for ki are all possible combinations that satisfy the equations. So the problem is equivalent to solving the system of linear equations over GF(5), and the number of solutions is the number of possible (k1, k2, ..., kn) in GF(5)^n that satisfy the system. Because each ki is allowed to be any value in 0-4 (which is the same as GF(5)), the answer is the number of solutions to the system of equations. But wait, that's only the case if the equations are over GF(5). So for example, if the system has a certain rank r, then the number of solutions is 5^(n - r). But how does that align with the problem's constraints that ki must be between 0 and 4? Since GF(5) is a field of order 5, each variable can take 5 possible values, and the system's solution space is a subspace of GF(5)^n. So the number of solutions is 5^(n - r), where r is the rank of the system.

Wait, but the problem says that each group's ki can be 0,1,2,3,4. Which is exactly the elements of GF(5). So if the system has a solution, then the number of solutions is 5^(d), where d is the number of free variables. So the approach is: for each query, compute the required deltas (per position), form the system of equations, and then compute the number of solutions modulo 1e9+7.

But the problem is that m can be up to 500. So for each query, the system has m equations (one per position) and n variables (one per group). The system is over GF(5). The question is, how to compute the number of solutions for each query's system efficiently.

But n can be up to 500, and m up to 500. So for each query, the system is 500 equations in 500 variables. Gaussian elimination over GF(5) for each query would be O(m*n^2), which for q=300 would be 300 * 500^3 = 3.75e8 operations. But that's probably too slow for Python. So we need a way to preprocess the system's coefficients (the group vectors) so that for each query, we can compute the solution count quickly.

Wait, but the group vectors are fixed. The groups are given, and each query introduces a new right-hand side (the required_deltas). So perhaps we can precompute the row-reduced echelon form of the coefficient matrix, and then for each query, perform the Gaussian elimination steps on the augmented matrix (coefficients and RHS), and determine if the system is consistent, and then compute the number of solutions based on the rank.

Alternatively, since the coefficient matrix is fixed (each row is the group's contributions), perhaps we can precompute a basis for the row space, and then for each query, express the RHS as a combination of this basis. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the coefficient matrix for the system is a m x n matrix, where each column corresponds to a group (variable ki), and each row corresponds to a position. So for group i, the coefficients for the equations are the s_i's values for each position. For example, group i's string is s_i, which is a string of m characters. Each character in s_i is a coefficient in the corresponding row (position) for the variable ki.

So the system is:

For each position j (from 0 to m-1):

sum_{i=1 to n} (s_i[j] * k_i) ≡ required_deltas[j] mod 5.

The variables are k_1, k_2, ..., k_n.

So the coefficient matrix is m rows by n columns. But in linear algebra terms, each equation is a row in the matrix. Wait, no. Each equation is a row in the matrix. So the matrix is m x n. Each row j is [s_1[j], s_2[j], ..., s_n[j]]. So the system is A * k ≡ b (mod 5), where A is the m x n matrix, k is the vector of variables, and b is the required_deltas vector.

But solving this system for each query's b is the key. So for each query, we need to check if the system is solvable, and compute the number of solutions. The number of solutions is 5^(n - r), where r is the rank of the augmented matrix (A | b), but only if the system is consistent. Otherwise, zero.

Wait, no. The system's solution count depends on the rank of the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix. If the augmented matrix's rank is greater than the coefficient matrix's rank, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, the number of solutions is 5^(n - r), where r is the rank of the coefficient matrix.

So the problem reduces to, for each query's required_deltas vector b, check if the system is solvable, and if so, compute 5^(n - r) mod 1e9+7, where r is the rank of the coefficient matrix A. Wait, but wait, the rank of the coefficient matrix A could vary per query if the system's augmented matrix's rank is different. But no, the rank of the coefficient matrix is fixed once the groups are given. The RHS (b) affects whether the system is consistent. So perhaps the coefficient matrix A has a certain rank, say r0, and for the augmented matrix [A | b], if the rank is r0 +1, then no solutions. Otherwise, if the rank is r0, then the number of solutions is 5^(n - r0).

Wait, no. The rank of the augmented matrix can't be higher than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If after adding the RHS column, the rank increases by 1, then the system is inconsistent. Otherwise, the rank is the same as the coefficient matrix, and the system has solutions. So for each query, we need to:

1. Check if the system is consistent. If not, answer is 0.

2. If consistent, the number of solutions is 5^(n - r), where r is the rank of the coefficient matrix A.

Wait, but why? Because in linear systems over a field, the solution space (if consistent) is an affine subspace of dimension (n - r). So the number of solutions is 5^(n - r). But how does that apply here?

Yes. So for example, if the coefficient matrix has rank r, then the solution space (if non-empty) is a coset of the null space of the coefficient matrix. The null space has dimension (n - r), so the number of solutions is 5^{n - r}.

But in our problem, the system is homogeneous only if the required_deltas are zero. Otherwise, it's non-homogeneous. So the answer depends on whether the system is solvable. If it is, then the number of solutions is 5^{d}, where d is the dimension of the solution space (d = n - r if the system is consistent and the coefficient matrix's rank is r).

Therefore, the problem requires for each query:

a. Check if the system is solvable (i.e., the required_deltas vector is in the column space of the coefficient matrix A).

b. If solvable, compute 5^{n - r} mod 1e9+7, where r is the rank of the coefficient matrix A.

Wait, but the coefficient matrix's rank is fixed. It's determined by the groups. So for all queries, the coefficient matrix A is the same. So the rank r is the same for all queries. Therefore, the steps are:

- Preprocess the coefficient matrix A (from the groups) to compute its rank r.

- For each query, compute the required_deltas vector, check if it's in the column space (i.e., the augmented matrix's rank is still r). If yes, the answer is 5^{n - r} mod MOD. Else, 0.

But wait, that can't be correct. Because the required_deltas vector can affect whether the augmented matrix's rank increases, even if the coefficient matrix's rank is r. For example, suppose the coefficient matrix has rank r, and the required_deltas vector is not in the column space. Then the augmented matrix's rank becomes r+1, leading to inconsistency.

But how do we check this efficiently?

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the row-reduced echelon form (RREF) of the coefficient matrix A. This gives the rank r.

2. For each query, form the augmented matrix by appending the required_deltas as a column. Then perform Gaussian elimination to see if the augmented matrix's rank is still r. If not, no solution. If yes, then the solution count is 5^{n - r}.

But Gaussian elimination for each query would take O(mn) time, which with q=300 and m=500, n=500, this could be manageable, but it's tight. Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute the RREF and a basis for the row space, and then for each query's required_deltas, check if it's a linear combination of the basis vectors.

Wait, but the system is A * k = b (mod 5). So for the system to be solvable, b must be in the column space of A. Because the equation is A * k = b. So the augmented matrix is [A | b], and we need to check if the rank of [A | b] is the same as rank of A. If yes, then solvable.

So for each query, the key step is to check if the vector b is in the column space of A.

But how to efficiently check this?

Another approach is to compute the RREF of the coefficient matrix A and find the rank r. Then, for each query, we can compute the coordinates of the required_deltas vector in the basis of the column space. If possible, then the system is solvable, else not.

Alternatively, since after row reduction of A, we can perform the same row operations on the vector b. If after reduction, the augmented part (the b vector) has any non-zero entries in the rows beyond the rank r, then the system is inconsistent. Otherwise, it's consistent.

So here's a plan:

- Preprocess the coefficient matrix A (m x n) by performing Gaussian elimination over GF(5) to reduce it to RREF. Keep track of the row swaps and other operations. During this process, determine the rank r of A.

- For each query, create the vector b (required_deltas), then perform the same row operations (as done during the RREF of A) on the vector b. Then check if the transformed b has any non-zero elements in the rows beyond the first r rows. If yes, then the system is inconsistent. Otherwise, it's consistent.

- If consistent, the answer is 5^(n - r) mod MOD. Else, 0.

This approach is efficient because once the RREF of A is precomputed, each query's check can be done quickly. The Gaussian elimination on A is done once, and for each query, we just apply the row operations to the vector b and check the result.

But how to implement this in code?

Let me think through the steps.

First, the coefficient matrix A is m rows by n columns. Each row j corresponds to the j-th position, and each column i corresponds to the i-th group's string's shift at position j. So for each group i, the string s_i has m characters, each converted to their numeric value (a=0, etc.). So for group i, column i in the matrix is the array [s_i[0], s_i[1], ..., s_i[m-1]].

But wait, the matrix is m x n. Each row corresponds to a position (equation), each column to a group (variable). So the (j, i) entry is s_i[j], where s_i is the string of the i-th group.

So the matrix A is:

A[j][i] = s_i[j] mod 5.

Now, during Gaussian elimination, we process each row, find a pivot, and eliminate the other rows. But since m can be up to 500 and n up to 500, this is manageable.

The steps for Gaussian elimination over GF(5) are:

1. For each row, find the leftmost non-zero element (pivot column). If all elements are zero, skip.

2. If a pivot is found, swap the current row with the pivot row (if necessary) to bring the pivot to the top of the remaining rows.

3. Normalize the pivot row by multiplying it by the inverse of the pivot element (since we're in GF(5), the inverse exists as long as the pivot is non-zero. The possible pivots are 1,2,3,4 mod 5, and inverses are 1, 3, 2, 4 respectively).

4. Eliminate all entries below and above the pivot column in all other rows by subtracting the appropriate multiple of the pivot row.

But to compute the RREF, the steps are standard.

Once the RREF of A is computed, we can find the rank r as the number of non-zero rows (pivots).

But for our purposes, perhaps we can track the steps taken during elimination (like which rows are swapped, which pivots are chosen, etc.), so that for each query's vector b, we can apply the same steps to b to check consistency.

Alternatively, during the elimination of A, we can record for each pivot step which rows were used, and for each query's b, perform forward substitution (i.e., apply the same row operations that were done during the elimination of A) to transform b into a new vector. Then, check if the transformed b has any non-zero elements in rows beyond the first r.

But how to implement this?

Another approach is to perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix [A | I], where I is the identity matrix. Then, the row operations that transform A into RREF would also be applied to I, which then becomes the transformation matrix. However, that's perhaps more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps during the Gaussian elimination of A, we can track the row operations applied (like row swaps, scaling, and row subtractions), and then for each query's b, apply those same row operations to b to see if the transformed b is compatible.

But implementing this is a bit involved.

Alternatively, for each query, we can perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix [A | b], but only up to the rank steps determined during the initial elimination of A. If during this process, a row is found where all coefficients are zero but the RHS is non-zero, the system is inconsistent.

But for each query, this would require O(m * r) operations, where r is the rank of A. Since m and r can be up to 500, and q up to 300, this would be manageable.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Preprocess the coefficient matrix A by converting it into RREF, determining the rank r, and keeping track of which columns are pivot columns. Also, note which rows are the pivot rows (each pivot row corresponds to a leading variable).

2. For each query's required_deltas vector b:

   a. Copy b into a vector (array) of size m.

   b. For each pivot row in the RREF of A:

      i. Check if the current row (pivot row) in the original A has a pivot. If in the RREF of A, this row is a pivot row (i.e., leading entry in some column).

      ii. Check if the corresponding entry in b is non-zero. If the pivot column for this row is in column j, then check if the entry in b's row (original row) is non-zero. Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated.

   Alternatively, during the preprocessing phase, for the RREF of A, we can track the pivot positions. Then, for each query's b:

   a. Apply forward elimination steps (like in Gaussian elimination) using the same pivots as found in the RREF of A. The idea is to process each pivot column in order. For each pivot in column c, row r:

      i. Check if in the current b vector, the element at row r is zero. If not, then this element (after scaling) would be the coefficient to eliminate the other rows. But since the matrix A is already in RREF, perhaps the steps are different.

   Maybe the correct approach is:

   For each query's b, perform the following steps:

   1. Start with the RREF of A.

   2. For each pivot in the RREF (in order of columns):

      a. Find the row in the RREF that has the pivot for column c.

      b. If the corresponding entry in b (after applying previous row operations) is non-zero, then this row is used to eliminate other entries in this column. But since A is already in RREF, the other rows in A have zeros in this column. So for the augmented matrix [A | b], after processing this pivot, the entries in the other rows for this column are zero. So the processing of b would involve:

         i. For the current pivot row r, check the value in b's row r. Let's call it v.

         ii. If v is zero, but the pivot row in A has a leading 1 in column c, then perhaps there's an inconsistency. Wait, no. The leading entry in A's row r is 1 (since it's RREF). So during elimination of b, we look at row r, column c, which is 1. Then, for the current pivot, we check if the value of b in row r is non-zero. If yes, then we can use this row to eliminate any other rows. Wait, but the matrix A is already in RREF, so other rows (if any) in the same column c would have zero entries. So perhaps the steps to check consistency are:

         For each pivot in the RREF of A:

            - The pivot is in row r, column c.

            - The value of b in row r must be equal to the coefficient that can be eliminated by the RREF rows.

            - If the value of b in row r is non-zero, then it's possible that this creates an inconsistency if there's no variable to adjust.

         Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

   Another approach is to perform the same row operations on the query vector b as were done during the Gaussian elimination of A. This would bring the augmented vector [A | b] into RREF form. Then, check if the augmented part (b) has any non-zero entries in the rows where A has all zeros. If yes, then the system is inconsistent.

   So during the preprocessing phase, when we perform Gaussian elimination on A, we track all the row operations (swaps, scaling, row additions). Then, for each query's b, we apply those same row operations to the vector b. Then, check if the resulting transformed b has any non-zero elements in the rows beyond the first r rows (where r is the rank of A). If yes, then the system is inconsistent.

   For example, after transforming A into RREF, the first r rows are the pivot rows, and the remaining m - r rows are all zero. So after applying the same row operations to b, if any of the m - r rows (from r onwards) in the transformed b are non-zero, then the system is inconsistent.

   So the steps are:

   Preprocessing:

   - For the coefficient matrix A, perform Gaussian elimination, tracking all row operations (swaps, scaling, adding multiples of rows, etc.).

   - This gives the RREF form of A, and the rank r.

   - Also, track the sequence of row operations, so that for any vector b, we can apply them to get the transformed b.

   For each query:

   - Compute the required_deltas vector b (m elements, each 0-4).

   - Apply all the row operations (from preprocessing) to the vector b.

   - Check if any of the elements in positions r, r+1, ..., m-1 of the transformed b are non-zero. If yes, answer is 0.

   - Else, the system is consistent, and the number of solutions is 5^(n - r) mod MOD.

   So the key is to track the row operations during the Gaussian elimination of A and apply them to b for each query.

   Implementing this in Python would require handling the row operations efficiently.

   But how to track the row operations? One way is to represent the row operations as a series of elementary matrices, but that's memory-intensive. Alternatively, perform the elimination step and track the order of pivots and row swaps.

   Alternatively, during the elimination, for each row, track the pivot column. Then, when processing a query's b, apply the same pivoting and elimination steps.

   Let me think of Gaussian elimination steps for the matrix A:

   Initialize a list of row swaps, scaling factors, and row operations. But this might be too involved.

   Alternatively, during the elimination of A, for each pivot, track the row and column, and for each row, eliminate other rows by subtracting a multiple of the pivot row. For each query's b, when processing the pivot, subtract the same multiple of the pivot row's value from the other rows.

   But perhaps the easiest way is to perform Gaussian elimination on A, and during the process, record the order of the pivot columns and the row operations. Then, for each query's b, apply the same row operations in the same order.

   Let's outline the Gaussian elimination steps for A:

   The matrix is stored as a list of rows. Each row is a list of elements (mod 5).

   The process is:

   rank = 0

   for each column c in 0 to n-1:

       find the row with the first non-zero element in column c, among rows >= rank.

       if no such row exists, continue to next column.

       swap this row with the row at index rank.

       pivot_row = rows[rank]

       # scale the pivot row so that the pivot element is 1.

       inv = inverse of pivot_row[c] in GF(5)

       for j in c to n-1:

           pivot_row[j] = (pivot_row[j] * inv) % 5

       # do the same scaling for the pivot row's element in the b vector (for queries)

       for each row r in 0 to m-1:

           if r != rank and rows[r][c] != 0:

               factor = rows[r][c]

               # subtract factor * pivot_row from row r.

               for j in c to n-1:

                   rows[r][j] = (rows[r][j] - factor * pivot_row[j]) %5

               # apply the same operation to the b vector (for queries)

       rank += 1

   So during the elimination, the steps are: for each pivot column c, find the pivot row, swap it to the current rank position, scale it to 1, then eliminate all other rows in that column.

   The problem is that for each query's b, we need to apply the same row operations (swaps, scaling, and elimination) to the b vector. So the steps for each query's b would be:

   Copy the original b vector into a list.

   For each step in the Gaussian elimination process of A:

       when a row swap was performed (e.g., swap row i and row j), apply the same swap to the elements in the b vector.

       when a pivot row was scaled (multiplied by inv), apply the same scaling to the b element in that row.

       when a row r was subtracted by factor * pivot_row (during elimination), subtract factor * b[pivot_row_index] from b[r].

   So during the preprocessing of A, we can track the sequence of row swaps, scalings, and row operations. Then, during the query processing, we apply each of these operations to the query's b vector.

   But how to track these operations? Because for each elimination step, the pivot row is processed, and other rows are eliminated. The operations are:

   1. Row swaps.

   2. Scaling of the pivot row.

   3. Elimination of other rows using the pivot row.

   So during the elimination of A, for each pivot step (column c), we need to record:

   - The pivot row index (after swapping).

   - The scaling factor applied to the pivot row.

   - For each other row, the factor used to eliminate their entry in column c.

   But this is a lot of information to track, and for n up to 500, this could be manageable.

   Alternatively, perhaps during the elimination of A, for each row operation (swap, scale, eliminate), we can record the parameters (like which rows were swapped, which rows were modified, etc.), and then for each query's b, we can reapply these operations in sequence.

   However, this would require a lot of memory and time. For example, each elimination step could involve up to m row operations, which for m=500 and n=500 would result in O(mn) steps. Storing this for each query may be feasible but would require careful coding.

   Another approach is to simulate the Gaussian elimination process for each query's b vector, using the same pivot choices as were made during the elimination of A. For example:

   Preprocessing:

   During elimination of A, for each column c, find the pivot row (if any) and record the pivot column and row. Also, for each pivot, record the scaling factor (inv) and the rows that were eliminated (but this may not be necessary).

   For each query's b:

   Create a copy of the vector b.

   For each pivot in the order they were found during preprocessing:

       column c, pivot_row = rank (after swapping).

       swap rows in b if needed (same swap as during A's elimination).

       scale the b's pivot_row by inv (same as during scaling of A's pivot row).

       for all other rows r in the matrix (during A's elimination), if they had a non-zero entry in column c, subtract factor * b[pivot_row] from b[r], where factor is the same as during A's elimination.

   But how to track which rows need to be processed for each pivot?

   This seems complicated. Perhaps an alternative is to re-perform the Gaussian elimination steps on the augmented vector [A | b], but using the same pivots as determined during the preprocessing of A. This way, the elimination steps are the same, and we can check for consistency.

   So here's a possible way:

   Preprocessing:

   For matrix A, perform Gaussian elimination and record the sequence of pivot columns and pivot rows. For each pivot step, note the pivot column and the pivot row (after swapping).

   For each query's b:

   Create an augmented vector b (m elements).

   For each pivot step in the order they were processed during preprocessing:

       column c: find the pivot row (which was swapped into position 'rank' during preprocessing).

       In the current augmented vector (b), check if the element in the pivot row (current rank) is zero. If not, proceed. Else, look for a row below (>= rank) with a non-zero element in column c, but since during preprocessing, the pivot was found as the first non-zero element in column c, this would have already been swapped. But during query processing, since the matrix A has already been transformed into RREF, the augmented vector is part of a new system.

   Wait, perhaps during the query processing, we need to perform the same pivot steps as during the preprocessing. So during preprocessing, for each pivot step, we know the column c and the pivot row (rank). For the query's b, we process each pivot in the same order:

   For each pivot step (c, rank):

       1. Swap the pivot row (the row in the current matrix that corresponds to the pivot row during preprocessing). Wait, but during preprocessing, rows may have been swapped. For example, during preprocessing, when processing column c, the pivot row was found in some row >= rank and swapped into row rank. So during query processing, we need to find the same pivot row.

       But since the matrix A has been transformed into RREF, the pivot rows are fixed.

       For example, during preprocessing, the pivot for column c is in row rank. So during query processing, we need to check the current augmented vector's row rank (after any previous row swaps) to see if it's non-zero in column c. But this is getting complicated.

   Maybe another approach is to process the query's vector by applying the same row swaps, scalings, and row operations that were applied to the matrix A during preprocessing.

   For example, during preprocessing, to transform A into RREF, we performed a sequence of row swaps, scalings, and row additions. For each query's vector, we need to apply these same operations to the vector b.

   How can this be done?

   Let's imagine that during preprocessing, for each row operation performed on A, we can represent it as a series of elementary row operations. For each such operation, when processing the query's vector, we apply the same operation to the vector.

   But storing all these operations would be memory-intensive for large n and m.

   An alternative idea is that during the preprocessing, we transform A into RREF, and for each row in the RREF, track the pivot columns and the steps taken. Then, for the query's vector b, we can process each pivot column in the same order and apply the same steps.

   Let's outline this:

   Preprocessing steps:

   1. Convert the matrix A into RREF, keeping track of all row swaps, scaling, and elimination steps.

   For each query's vector b:

   1. Apply the same row swaps that were applied during preprocessing to the vector b.

   2. Apply the scaling steps (multiplying the pivot rows by the inverse of the pivot element) to the vector b.

   3. Apply the same elimination steps (subtracting multiples of pivot rows from other rows) to the vector b.

   Then, check if in the transformed vector b, any of the elements beyond the first r rows are non-zero (where r is the rank of A). If yes, the system is inconsistent, answer is 0. Otherwise, answer is 5^(n - r).

   But how to apply these steps?

   Let's think of it as follows:

   When we perform row swaps during preprocessing, we swap the rows of A and the rows of the vector b. So during query processing, we need to apply these swaps to the vector b in the same order.

   Similarly, when we scale a row (multiply by inv), the same scaling is applied to the corresponding element of the vector b.

   When we eliminate a row by subtracting a multiple of the pivot row, we also subtract the same multiple of the pivot row's b element from the current row's b element.

   So during preprocessing, we can track the sequence of these operations and apply them to each query's b.

   But how to track them?

   Here's an alternative approach. For each pivot step in the RREF of A:

   - The pivot is in column c, row r.

   - For row r, the pivot element is 1.

   - For all other rows, the element in column c is 0.

   So when processing the vector b for a query, after applying all row swaps and scalings, we can check if the transformed vector b has any non-zero elements in the rows where the RREF of A has non-pivot rows (i.e., rows after rank r).

   But during the elimination steps, the row operations on the vector b are applied in such a way that after processing each pivot, the entries in the pivot column for other rows are zero. So after processing all pivots, the transformed vector b should have zeros in the rows corresponding to the non-pivot rows of A's RREF. If not, then the system is inconsistent.

   So the steps for a query's vector b are:

   For each pivot in the RREF of A (processed in the order of columns):

       - The pivot is in column c, row r.

       - The current value of b[r] must be such that when combined with the RREF of A, the augmented matrix [A | b] has a compatible row.

       Wait, perhaps this is getting too vague.

   Another idea is to process each query's vector b by performing the same steps as Gaussian elimination, using the same pivots as found in A's RREF.

   For example:

   During preprocessing, we have the RREF of A, and a list of pivot columns and rows.

   For a query's vector b:

       Create a copy of the vector as a list.

       For each pivot in the order they were selected during preprocessing (column c, row r):

           if the current value of b[r] is zero:

               then proceed to the next pivot.

           else:

               the coefficient is (b[r] * 1) mod 5 (since the pivot element is 1 in A's RREF).

               for each row in the original matrix (other than r) that has a non-zero entry in column c:

                   subtract (coefficient * A[row][c]) from b[row], but since A's RREF has zero in those positions, this is zero. So perhaps this is not necessary.

       After processing all pivots, check if the remaining rows (b[r+1 ... m-1]) are all zero. If yes, then the system is consistent.

   Wait, but in the RREF of A, the rows after rank r are all zero. So after applying the same row operations to the vector b, any non-zero elements in these rows would indicate an inconsistency.

   So the process for the query's vector b is:

   Apply the same row operations that were applied to A during Gaussian elimination. After these operations, the transformed vector b' must have zeros in all rows beyond the first r rows. Otherwise, the system is inconsistent.

   Therefore, the steps are:

   1. Preprocess the matrix A into RREF, keeping track of all row swaps, scalings, and elimination steps.

   2. For each query's vector b:

       a. Apply all the row swaps, scalings, and eliminations steps (from preprocessing) to the vector b.

       b. Check if any element in the transformed b's rows from r to m-1 is non-zero. If yes, answer is 0.

       c. Else, the answer is 5^(n - r) mod MOD.

   The challenge is to apply the row operations to the vector b efficiently.

   Now, how to implement this in code.

   Let's outline the code structure.

   First, we need to read n and m, then read n strings (each of length m), which are the groups. Each group contributes 4 copies of the same string, but since the count can be 0-4, the actual counts are handled via the variables ki.

   Then, for each group's string, we need to convert each character to its numeric value (a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3, e=4).

   The coefficient matrix A is an m x n matrix. Each column corresponds to a group's string, and each row corresponds to a position. So for group i (0 to n-1), the column i in A is the array of s_i's characters.

   Wait, no. Each group's string is s_i of length m. So for each position j (0 to m-1), the coefficient for group i's variable k_i is s_i[j]. So the matrix A has m rows and n columns. Each row j corresponds to equation j, and each column i corresponds to variable k_i. So A[j][i] = s_i[j].

   So, for example, group 0's string is s_0. For row j (equation j), the coefficient for k_0 is s_0[j].

   Now, the code steps:

   1. Read n and m.

   2. Read n strings. For each group i, store the numeric values of the characters. So groups is a list of lists: groups[i] = [0, 1, ...], etc.

   3. Build the coefficient matrix A as m rows x n columns. For each row j in 0..m-1, A[j] is a list of groups[i][j] for each i in 0..n-1.

   Then, perform Gaussian elimination on A over GF(5) to compute its RREF and rank r.

   But Gaussian elimination for GF(5) is different from floating-point. So the code must handle:

   - Finding the pivot in each column.

   - Swapping rows.

   - Scaling rows by the inverse of the pivot element.

   - Eliminating other rows.

   So code for Gaussian elimination:

   The matrix is stored as a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers mod 5.

   During elimination:

   rank = 0

   for each column c in 0..n-1:

       # Find the pivot row

       pivot_row = None

       for r in range(rank, m):

           if A[r][c] %5 != 0:

               pivot_row = r

               break

       if pivot_row is None:

           continue

       # Swap rows 'rank' and 'pivot_row'

       A[rank], A[pivot_row] = A[pivot_row], A[rank]

       # Scale the pivot row so that A[rank][c] is 1

       coeff = A[rank][c]

       inv = modinv(coeff, 5)

       for j in range(c, n):

           A[rank][j] = (A[rank][j] * inv) %5

       # Eliminate all other rows

       for r in range(m):

           if r != rank and A[r][c] !=0:

               factor = A[r][c]

               for j in range(c, n):

                   A[r][j] = (A[r][j] - factor * A[rank][j]) %5

       rank +=1

   After this, the matrix A is in RREF, and rank is the number of pivots.

   However, this code is for the matrix A. But during this process, we need to track the row swaps, scaling, and elimination steps so that we can apply them to the query vectors.

   So for each query vector b, which is a list of m elements, we need to apply the same row operations.

   So during the Gaussian elimination of A, we can track each operation and record them in a list. Then, when processing a query's b, we apply the operations in the same order.

   For example:

   Each operation is one of:

   - Swap rows i and j.

   - Scale row i by factor.

   - Subtract factor * row i from row j.

   So during preprocessing, we can create a list of these operations. Then, for each query, apply them in order to the vector b.

   But with n up to 500 and m up to 500, this could generate a lot of operations (O(nm)), which for q=300 would be 300*500*500 = 75 million operations. Which is manageable.

   So the plan is:

   Preprocessing:

   1. Build the matrix A.

   2. Perform Gaussian elimination on A, recording all row operations (swaps, scaling, elimination) in a list.

   3. After elimination, the rank r is determined.

   Query processing:

   For each query's b:

   1. Convert the target string to the required_deltas vector (each element is (char - 'a') mod 5).

   2. Check if the length is m.

   3. Apply all the recorded row operations to the vector b.

   4. Check if any of the elements in the transformed b from row r to m-1 are non-zero. If yes, output 0.

   5. Else, compute pow(5, n - r, MOD) and output that.

   Now, the challenge is to record the row operations during preprocessing.

   Let's think about how to record the operations:

   For each swap of rows i and j: record ('swap', i, j).

   For each scaling of row i by factor inv: record ('scale', i, inv).

   For each elimination step where row j is subtracted by factor * row i: record ('eliminate', j, i, factor).

   So during preprocessing, for each step in Gaussian elimination:

   When we swap rows, record the swap.

   When we scale the pivot row, record the scaling.

   When we eliminate other rows, record the elimination steps.

   Then, during query processing, apply these operations in the same order to the query's b.

   But how to implement this?

   Let's outline the code for Gaussian elimination with recording:

   operations = []

   rank = 0

   for c in range(n):

       pivot_row = None

       for r in range(rank, m):

           if A[r][c] %5 !=0:

               pivot_row = r

               break

       if pivot_row is None:

           continue

       if pivot_row != rank:

           # swap rows rank and pivot_row

           A[rank], A[pivot_row] = A[pivot_row], A[rank]

           operations.append( ('swap', rank, pivot_row) )

       coeff = A[rank][c]

       inv = modinv(coeff, 5)

       # scale the row

       for j in range(c, n):

           A[rank][j] = (A[rank][j] * inv) %5

       operations.append( ('scale', rank, inv) )

       # eliminate other rows

       for r in range(m):

           if r != rank and A[r][c] !=0:

               factor = A[r][c]

               # subtract factor * row rank from row r

               for j in range(c, n):

                   A[r][j] = (A[r][j] - factor * A[rank][j]) %5

               operations.append( ('eliminate', r, rank, factor) )

       rank +=1

   But wait, the elimination steps for each row r are processed in a loop, and for each such row, the elimination is recorded.

   However, this approach records all elimination steps, which could be O(m) steps per pivot. For m=500, n=500, this would be O(500*500) = 250,000 operations. Which is manageable.

   Now, during query processing, the operations are applied to the vector b as follows:

   For each operation in the operations list:

       if it's a swap: swap elements i and j in b.

       if it's a scale: multiply element i by inv mod5.

       if it's an eliminate: subtract factor * b[src_row] from b[dest_row], mod5.

   So, for example, during a query:

   b = [ ... ] (original required_deltas)

   for op in operations:

       if op[0] == 'swap':

           i, j = op[1], op[2]

           b[i], b[j] = b[j], b[i]

       elif op[0] == 'scale':

           i, inv = op[1], op[2]

           b[i] = (b[i] * inv) %5

       elif op[0] == 'eliminate':

           dest, src, factor = op[1], op[2], op[3]

           b[dest] = (b[dest] - factor * b[src]) %5

   After applying all operations, check the last m - r elements of b.

   So the code for query processing is:

   def process_query(b_str):

       b = [(ord(c) - ord('a')) %5 for c in b_str]

       # Apply all operations

       for op in operations:

           if op[0] == 'swap':

               i, j = op[1], op[2]

               b[i], b[j] = b[j], b[i]

           elif op[0] == 'scale':

               i, inv = op[1], op[2]

               b[i] = (b[i] * inv) %5

           elif op[0] == 'eliminate':

               dest, src, factor = op[1], op[2], op[3]

               b[dest] = (b[dest] - factor * b[src]) %5

       # Check for consistency

       for r in range(rank, m):

           if b[r] %5 !=0:

               return 0

       return pow(5, n - rank, MOD)

   But wait, after applying all operations, the transformed vector b should have zeros in the rows >= rank. Because during the elimination of A, the rows beyond rank are all zeros. So any non-zero in these positions after processing indicates an inconsistency.

   So this should work.

   Now, the key functions are:

   - modinv: compute the inverse modulo 5. Since 5 is prime, the inverse of a is a^(5-2) mod5. But for the values 0-4, only 1,2,3,4 have inverses. But during Gaussian elimination, the pivot is non-zero, so coeff is 1,2,3,4.

   The modinv can be precomputed for GF(5) as:

   inv[1] = 1

   inv[2] = 3 (since 2*3=6 mod5=1)

   inv[3] = 2 (since 3*2=6 mod5=1)

   inv[4] =4 (4*4=16 mod5=1)

   So for coeff in 1-4, the inverse is [0,1,3,2,4].

   So in code:

   modinv_coeff = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]

   So when coeff is 2, inv is modinv_coeff[2] =3.

   So during scaling, the inv is looked up from this array.

   Now, the code for preprocessing and query processing.

   Putting it all together:

   Read n and m.

   Read n groups' strings. For each, convert to a list of integers (0-4).

   Build the matrix A: m rows, n columns. Each row j is [groups[i][j] for i in 0..n-1].

   Perform Gaussian elimination on A, recording the operations.

   Precompute the rank.

   Read q queries, for each, process the required_deltas vector as described.

   Now, code:

   Implement modinv for GF(5) via a lookup table.

   Then, implement the Gaussian elimination with recording.

   Now, let's test this approach with the first example:

   Example 1:

   Input:

   1 1

   b

   2

   a

   e

   The groups are one group of 'b', which is 1. The matrix A is 1 row (m=1), 1 column (n=1). The row is [1] (since 'b' is 1).

   During Gaussian elimination:

   Column 0:

   Find pivot row 0 (since A[0][0] =1 !=0).

   No swap needed.

   Scale row 0 by inv(1) =1. So row becomes [1].

   Eliminate other rows (none).

   Rank becomes 1.

   So operations list:

   [('scale', 0, 1)] (since scaling by 1 mod5 has no effect, but it's recorded).

   For the first query, target is 'a', required_deltas is 0.

   Apply operations:

   b starts as [0].

   Apply scale: b[0] *=1 → remains 0.

   Check rows from rank 1 to m-1 (which is 0, since m=1). So no check. The answer is 5^(1-1) =1.

   Second query: target 'e', which is 4. required_deltas is 4.

   Apply operations:

   b starts as [4].

   Apply scale: 4 *1 →4.

   Check rows from rank 1 (which is 1, but m=1). So no check. So answer is 5^(1-1) =1. Which matches the example.

   The second example:

   Input:

   2 4

   aaaa

   bbbb

   1

   cccc

   The groups are two groups:

   group 0: aaaa → [0,0,0,0]

   group 1: bbbb → [1,1,1,1]

   The matrix A is 4 rows (m=4), 2 columns (n=2):

   Row 0: [0, 1]

   Row 1: [0, 1]

   Row 2: [0, 1]

   Row 3: [0, 1]

   Wait, no. Each group's string has m=4 characters. So the matrix A is m=4 rows and n=2 columns. So group 0's string is 'aaaa', which for each row j (0-3), A[j][0] =0. group 1's string is 'bbbb', so A[j][1] =1 for all j.

   So matrix A:

   Row 0: [0, 1]

   Row 1: [0, 1]

   Row 2: [0, 1]

   Row 3: [0, 1]

   So during Gaussian elimination:

   Column 0:

   All rows have 0. So pivot not found. Move to column 1.

   Column 1:

   Find pivot row at row 0. Swap (if needed). Scale row 0 by inv(1)=1. So row 0 becomes [0,1]. Then, eliminate other rows.

   For rows 1-3:

   subtract 1 * row0 from each.

   For row 1: [0,1] -1* [0,1] → [0,0].

   Similarly for rows 2 and 3.

   Now, matrix is:

   row 0: [0,1]

   row 1: [0,0]

   row 2: [0,0]

   row 3: [0,0]

   So rank is 1.

   Operations recorded:

   For column 0: no pivot.

   For column 1:

   pivot found at row 0.

   no swap.

   scale row 0 by 1.

   eliminate rows 1,2,3:

   For row 1: factor is 1 (A[1][1] is 1 before elimination). Subtract 1 * row0 from row1. So operations are ('eliminate', 1,0,1), then ('eliminate', 2,0,1), then ('eliminate',3,0,1).

   So operations list includes:

   'scale',0,1

   'eliminate',1,0,1

   'eliminate',2,0,1

   'eliminate',3,0,1

   Now, when processing the query for target 'cccc' (each character is 'c' → 2), required_deltas is [2,2,2,2].

   Apply the operations to the vector [2,2,2,2].

   Let's step through each operation:

   The initial b is [2,2,2,2].

   The operations are:

   1. scale row 0 by 1 → no change.

   2. eliminate row1 from row0:

       b[1] = (b[1] - 1 * b[0]) mod5 → 2 -1*2=0 mod5.

       So after this, b becomes [2,0,2,2].

   3. eliminate row2 from row0:

       b[2] = (2 -1*2) =0 mod5 → [2,0,0,2].

   4. eliminate row3 from row0:

       b[3] = (2 -1*2)=0 mod5 → [2,0,0,0].

   After all operations, the vector is [2,0,0,0].

   Now, check rows from rank=1 to m-1=3:

   rows 1, 2, 3. Their values are 0,0,0. So the system is consistent.

   The answer is 5^(2 -1) =5^1=5. Which matches the example.

   So this approach works.

   Now, code implementation:

   The code needs to handle the matrix A, perform Gaussian elimination, record operations, and process queries.

   Now, code:

   Read n and m.

   Read n strings, each of length m. Convert each to a list of integers (0-4).

   Build matrix A as m rows x n columns.

   Perform Gaussian elimination, recording operations.

   Then, read q queries, process each.

   Let's code this in Python.

   First, precompute modinv for GF(5):

   inv = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]

   Then, for the Gaussian elimination:

   We need to track the operations.

   But when we swap rows during elimination, the matrix A is modified. So the code must track the current state of the matrix.

   However, during preprocessing, the matrix is modified in-place, and the operations are recorded.

   So the code for preprocessing:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 +7

    inv5 = [0,1,3,2,4]  # inverse modulo 5 for 0,1,2,3,4.

    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    groups = []

    for _ in range(n):

        s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

        groups.append( [ (ord(c) - ord('a')) %5 for c in s ] )

    # Build matrix A: m rows x n columns.

    A = []

    for j in range(m):

        row = []

        for i in range(n):

            row.append( groups[i][j] )

        A.append(row)

    operations = []

    rank =0

    for c in range(n):

        # Find pivot in column c, starting from row rank

        pivot_row = None

        for r in range(rank, m):

            if A[r][c] %5 !=0:

                pivot_row = r

                break

        if pivot_row is None:

            continue

        # Swap with current rank row

        if pivot_row != rank:

            A[rank], A[pivot_row] = A[pivot_row], A[rank]

            operations.append( ('swap', rank, pivot_row) )

        # Scale the pivot row to have 1 in column c

        coeff = A[rank][c]

        inv = inv5[coeff %5]

        # Scale the entire row

        for j in range(c, n):

            A[rank][j] = (A[rank][j] * inv) %5

        operations.append( ('scale', rank, inv) )

        # Eliminate other rows

        for r in range(m):

            if r == rank:

                continue

            factor = A[r][c] %5

            if factor !=0:

   Sample input 2:

   aaaa

   bbbb

   1

   cccc

   groups are:

   group 0: [0,0,0,0]

   group 1: [1,1,1,1]

   matrix A is 4 rows, 2 columns:

   row 0: [0, 1]

   row 1: [0, 1]

   row 2: [0, 1]

   row 3: [0, 1]

   Gaussian elimination steps:

   column 0:

   pivot not found.

   column 1:

   pivot at row 0.

   no swap.

   scale row 0 by inv(1)=1.

   eliminate rows 1,2,3.

   So the operations are:

   ('scale', 0, 1),

   ('eliminate', 1, 0, 1),

   ('eliminate', 2, 0, 1),

   ('eliminate', 3, 0, 1).

   rank=1.

   Query for 'cccc' → [2,2,2,2].

   Applying the operations:

   initial current_b = [2,2,2,2].

   apply 'scale' 0: multiply by 1 → no change.

   then eliminate row1:

   current_b[1] = (2 -1*2) mod5 →0.

   current_b becomes [2,0,2,2].

   eliminate row2:

   current_b[2] = (2 -1*2) →0. current_b becomes [2,0,0,2].

   eliminate row3:

   current_b[3] = (2 -1*2) →0. current_b becomes [2,0,0,0].

   Check rows from rank=1 to 3:

   rows 1,2,3: values 0,0,0. valid.

   answer is 5^(2-1) =5. Which matches the sample.

   So the code works.

   Now, check for possible bugs.

   Edge cases: when there are multiple groups, and the rank is zero. For example, all groups have strings with all zeros. Then, the required_deltas must be all zero. The number of solutions is 5^n (since all variables can be 0-4, and all equations are 0=0).

   Another edge case: when m=0. But according to constraints, m >=1.

   Time and memory constraints:

   For n=500, m=500, the code's Gaussian elimination would process up to 500 columns, each with up to 500 rows. Each operation is stored as a tuple. The number of operations could be O(mn), which for 500x500 is 250,000. For q=300, each query requires 250,000 operations on a vector of size 500. Python can handle this.

   Memory-wise, storing 250,000 operations (each being a small tuple) is manageable.

   So this code should pass all test cases.
