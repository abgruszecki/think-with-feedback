Okay, so the problem is to convert a given positive integer n into its binary representation without leading zeros. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the constraints mention that n can be up to 1e6, which isn't very big. But even for numbers up to that size, the binary representation won't be too long. Like 1e6 in binary is about 20 bits. So handling that should be manageable.

The straightforward way in Python is to use the built-in bin() function. Oh right, because bin(5) returns '0b101', so we just need to strip the '0b' prefix. That's simple. For example, bin(n)[2:] would give the correct result. But wait, are there any edge cases? Like n=1, which should output '1', and that works. What about zero? But the constraints say n is positive, so we don't need to handle zero.

So the solution could be as simple as reading the integer and printing bin(n)[2:]. But wait, maybe there's a way to do this manually for learning purposes. But given that Python's built-in is optimized, using bin() is probably the fastest and most efficient method.

Another approach could be to repeatedly divide by 2 and collect the remainders. Like, while n > 0, take n mod 2, then divide n by 2. Then reverse the collected remainders to get the binary string. But for n up to 1e6, this loop would run about 20 times, which is trivial. But building a string this way in Python with concatenations or list operations would still be efficient enough.

But comparing the two methods: the built-in bin() is definitely going to be faster than any manual loop in Python, because it's implemented in C. So for optimal speed and memory usage, using bin() is the way to go.

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    print(bin(n)[2:], file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
126
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1111110
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

So this approach is correct and efficient. There's no need for any additional steps. The code is concise and uses minimal memory since it's just converting and slicing a string.

Another thing to consider: the input is read as an integer, which is straightforward. No errors here as the input is guaranteed to be a valid integer per the problem statement.

So the optimal solution is indeed to use the built-in bin function and slice off the prefix.

```python
print(bin(int(input()))[2:])
```
