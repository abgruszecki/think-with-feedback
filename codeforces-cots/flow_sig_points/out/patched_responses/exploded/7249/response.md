Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the longest subarray where the most frequent value isn't unique. That means, in that subarray, there should be at least two different values that share the maximum frequency. If all elements are the same, then the answer is zero.

Hmm. Let's think about possible approaches. The constraints are tight: n can be up to 200,000. So O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. We need something linear or O(n) with some factors based on the frequencies.

Wait, the array elements are up to min(n, 100). Oh right, so the maximum possible value of a_i is 100. That's a crucial point. Because the number of distinct elements in the array can't exceed 100. That might help us design an algorithm that loops over possible pairs of elements and checks subarrays where these two are the most frequent and have the same count.

So the idea here is that for a subarray to satisfy the condition, there must be at least two elements that have the maximum frequency. So the maximum frequency in the subarray is f, and there are at least two elements with f occurrences. So the problem reduces to finding the longest subarray where two elements have the same maximum frequency, and that frequency is as high as possible.

How can we model this? One approach is to consider all possible pairs of elements. Since the number of distinct elements is up to 100, the number of pairs is 100*100=10,000, which is manageable. For each pair (x, y), we can look for the longest subarray where the count of x equals the count of y, and these counts are the maximum in the subarray. Then take the maximum over all such pairs.

Alternatively, maybe for each possible pair of elements x and y, we can compute the maximum length of a subarray where the counts of x and y are equal and are the highest in that subarray. Then the answer would be the maximum of these values over all pairs.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Another approach is inspired by the problem where you find the longest subarray where the count of two elements are equal and those are the only elements. But in this problem, other elements can exist, but their counts must not exceed the counts of x and y.

Wait, no. For the subarray to satisfy the condition, the maximum frequency is f, and there are at least two elements with f. So in such a subarray, x and y both have f occurrences, and all other elements have <=f.

So if we can find for each pair (x, y) the longest subarray where x and y have the same count, and that count is greater than or equal to all other elements' counts in the subarray. Then the maximum over all such pairs would be the answer.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Another thought: for each x in the array, track the positions where x occurs. Then for each pair (x, y), find the maximum window where the difference between the counts of x and y is zero (i.e., x and y have the same count), and in that window, all other elements have counts <= the count of x (which is equal to y's count). But how to enforce that all other elements have counts <= f?

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal subarray is such that there are two elements x and y where their counts in the subarray are equal, and all other elements in the subarray have counts <= that count. Then, the length of the subarray would be (count_x + count_y + sum of counts of other elements where each is <= count_x). But since count_x = count_y = f, the maximum possible sum is 2f + (sum of others, each ≤f). But this might not be directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible subarray would have exactly two elements with f occurrences, and others with ≤f. But how to model this.

Another angle: Since the answer requires the maximum frequency to be shared by at least two elements, the best candidates for such a subarray are those where the two most frequent elements have their counts equal. So perhaps the optimal approach is to check all possible pairs of elements (x, y) and for each pair, find the longest subarray where x and y are present in equal numbers, and in that subarray, no other element occurs more than that count.

The key is that for each pair x and y, we can model the problem as follows: find the maximum length of a subarray where x's count equals y's count, and during this subarray, whenever any other element z is present, their count in the subarray is <= the count of x (and y). Then, the maximum over all x,y pairs would be our answer.

But how to compute this.

An approach inspired by the problem where we find the longest subarray with equal number of two elements (like 0s and 1s) could be useful here. For that problem, we track the balance (count_0 - count_1) and keep a hashmap of the first occurrence of each balance. For each position, we compute the current balance and check if we have seen it before, which would indicate that between those two indices, the counts are equal.

But in our case, we need to track the difference between x and y counts, and also ensure that all other elements in the subarray have counts <= the current x/y count.

This seems challenging. Let's think.

For a given pair x and y, when we traverse the array, we can track the difference between the counts of x and y. If the difference is the same at two indices, the subarray between them has equal x and y counts. However, we need to ensure that in this subarray, no other element's count exceeds the x/y count.

So during the traversal, whenever we encounter a z not equal to x or y, we have to track its count and ensure that it doesn't exceed the current x/y count. But how to model this. Because for any z, their counts can vary, and ensuring that at every position in the subarray, the z's count is <= the x's count (which equals y's count) is difficult.

This seems like a dead end. Because even if x and y counts are balanced, some other elements may have higher counts in parts of the subarray.

Alternative idea: Maybe in the optimal subarray, the two most frequent elements are x and y, and all other elements in the subarray have counts less than or equal to the count of x and y. So, the subarray's maximum frequency is exactly the count of x and y, and there are two elements with that frequency.

So for each pair (x, y), we need to find the maximum length of a subarray where:

1. The count of x equals the count of y.

2. For all other elements z in the subarray, their counts in the subarray are <= the count of x.

If we can find this for each pair, then the maximum over all pairs is the answer.

So, how to compute this for a given pair (x, y).

Let's model this. Let's iterate through the array, keeping track of the counts of x, y, and all other elements in the current window. Wait, but that's O(n^2) for all possible pairs, which is 10,000 * O(n) steps, which for n=2e5 would be 2e9 operations. That's way too slow.

Wait, but the number of pairs is 100*100=10^4, which for 2e5 elements gives 2e9 operations. That's way beyond the time limit. So this approach isn't feasible.

We need a smarter approach.

Hmm. Let's think about the maximum possible answer. For example, in the first sample input, the answer is 6. The subarray is 6 elements long, with 2 of each of 1, 2, and 3. The maximum frequency is 2, but all three elements have 2 counts. So the maximum frequency is not unique.

So, perhaps the optimal subarray has two elements with the same maximum count, but there could be others as well. But the problem requires that the most frequent value (the maximum frequency) is not unique. So even if three elements have the same maximum frequency, that's acceptable.

But how do we find such a subarray?

Alternative approach: For each possible frequency f, check if there exists a subarray where at least two different elements have f occurrences, and no element has more than f occurrences in the subarray. Then find the largest possible length of such a subarray.

But the problem is, how to check this for all possible f.

Alternatively, we can iterate over possible f values in decreasing order. For each f, check if there exists a subarray where two elements have exactly f occurrences each, and all others have <=f. The maximum such f would give the longest possible subarray.

But again, how to check this efficiently.

Another observation: For a subarray to have two elements x and y with count f, and all others with count <=f, the minimal possible length is 2f (if there are only x and y in the subarray). The maximum possible length is 2f + (sum of other elements up to f each). But this is vague.

Wait, but in a subarray where x and y each have f occurrences, and all other elements have up to f occurrences. The total length would be f (x) + f (y) + sum of other elements (each <=f). But in that case, the sum of other elements can't exceed (number of other elements) * f. But this depends on the number of other elements in the subarray.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible subarray for a given f is determined by the positions where x and y's counts reach f. But again, not sure.

Another angle: Since the problem is to find the maximum length subarray where two elements have the same maximum frequency, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider all possible pairs (x, y) and track their occurrences. But how to do that efficiently.

Wait, given that the elements are up to 100, maybe for each element x, we can track the positions where x occurs, and for each x, iterate through all elements y (y != x) and find the maximum window where x and y's counts are equal and that window is valid (other elements' counts <= f). But again, how to do this.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the first approach. For a fixed pair x and y, the problem reduces to finding the longest subarray where:

- the count of x equals the count of y (since f for x and y would be their counts in the subarray)
- all other elements in the subarray have counts <= the count of x (and y, since they are equal)

So, how can we find such a window?

Let's model the problem for x and y. Let's create a difference array, where each element is +1 if the element is x, -1 if it's y, and 0 otherwise. Then, the sum of this array over a subarray [l, r] is (count_x - count_y). So for a subarray where count_x = count_y, the sum would be zero.

But how to enforce that all other elements in the subarray have counts <= count_x.

This seems difficult, but perhaps there's a way to track this.

Alternatively, for the x and y pair, we can process the array and track for each position i the count of x, y, and for other elements, track their counts. For each possible window, we need to ensure that for any other z in the window, count_z <= count_x (which equals count_y). But tracking this for all z in real time is expensive.

Alternative approach: For each x and y pair, iterate through the array and keep track of the counts of x and y, and the maximum count of any other element in the current window. If the counts of x and y are equal (say, f), and the maximum count of any other element in the window is <=f, then this window is a candidate. The maximum length of such a window is our answer for x and y.

But how to efficiently track the maximum count of any other element in the current window. For each x and y, when we slide the window, we need to know the max count of any z not x or y in the current window. This seems tricky, as the elements can vary.

But considering that the window can be dynamic, perhaps a sliding window approach could be used here. Let's try:

For a pair (x, y), we can use a sliding window [l, r], and track:

- cnt_x: the number of x in the current window
- cnt_y: the number of y in the current window
- max_other: the maximum count of any other element in the window (excluding x and y)

We want cnt_x == cnt_y and max_other <= cnt_x. The goal is to find the maximum (r - l + 1) where these conditions hold.

How to efficiently manage the window.

Sliding window approach:

Initialize l=0. For each r in 0..n-1:

- if a[r] is x: cnt_x +=1
- elif a[r] is y: cnt_y +=1
- else: update the count of a[r], and track the max_other.

After adding a[r], check if cnt_x == cnt_y, and max_other <= cnt_x. If so, record the window length.

But how to adjust the left pointer l to find the maximum possible window. Because the window may have some elements that are not x or y and their counts could exceed cnt_x, which is equal to cnt_y.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible r, we can track the earliest l where the current conditions hold.

But this seems difficult. Because as we move r, the cnt_x and cnt_y can change, and the max_other can also change.

Alternatively, for each possible pair (x, y), we can process the array, and whenever we encounter a z not x or y, we need to track its count. However, for this approach, the sliding window may need to adjust the left pointer whenever a z's count in the window exceeds the current cnt_x (which is supposed to be equal to cnt_y).

This could get complicated. But perhaps for each x and y, the approach would be O(n) time, which multiplied by 10^4 pairs (for 100 elements), gives 2e6 operations, which is manageable.

Wait, n is up to 2e5, and 2e5 * 1e4 = 2e9, which is way too big. So that approach is not feasible.

Wait, 100 elements, so the number of pairs is (100 choose 2) + 100 (if considering pairs where x and y are the same? No, no. Because in the problem, x and y must be different. So the number of pairs is 100*99/2 = 4950. So 4950 pairs. For each pair, processing O(n) time would be 2e5 * 4950 = 9.9e8 operations. Which is about a billion operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second. So that approach would not be feasible.

Hmm. So this approach is not going to work. Need a better idea.

Alternative idea: For each element x, track the positions where x occurs. Then, for each x, look for the positions where another element y occurs, such that between two of their occurrence positions, the counts of x and y are equal and their counts are the maximum in the subarray.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key insight here might be that the maximum possible answer can be found by considering the cases where two elements alternate frequently. For example, in the first example, 1,1,2,2,3,3. So each occurs twice. So the maximum frequency is 2, and two elements (actually three) have that frequency.

So perhaps the optimal subarray is a segment where two elements have the same count, and this count is the maximum in the subarray.

But how to find this.

Another angle: The answer can't be larger than the minimal possible when two elements have the same count. For example, if the entire array is made of two elements x and y, each appearing k times. Then the answer would be 2k. But if there are other elements in the array, then their counts have to be <=k.

But how to find such a scenario.

Let's think of the problem as needing to find a subarray where:

- There are two elements (x and y) that each have frequency f.

- All other elements in the subarray have frequencies <=f.

The maximum possible length of such a subarray is 2f + sum (counts of other elements, each <=f). Since sum of other elements counts can be up to (number of other elements in the subarray) *f. But this sum is unbounded unless the number of other elements is limited.

But since the elements are up to 100, perhaps the number of distinct elements in the subarray could be up to 100. But again, not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the maximum possible answer is when the entire array is considered. But in the first example, the entire array isn't valid because the 3's count is 3, which is higher than others. So the optimal subarray is a part of the array.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of frequencies. For each possible frequency f, can we find a subarray where two elements have f occurrences and all others have <=f?

Then the maximum f for which this is possible gives the maximum possible length.

But how to check for all f.

Alternatively, binary search on f. For each possible f, check if there exists a subarray where two elements have at least f occurrences each, and all other elements in the subarray have at most f occurrences. Then the maximum possible such f gives the answer.

But how to check this efficiently.

But binary search on f may not directly work because the answer's length is not strictly a function of f. For example, a higher f could have a longer subarray if there are more other elements allowed. So this approach may not work.

Alternative idea: Since the maximum possible value of f is up to 1e5 (since n is up to 2e5), but checking for each f is O(n), which is O(2e5) steps. But again, for 1e5 f's, that's 2e10 operations. Which is impossible.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. Let's think of the constraints again. The maximum a_i is up to 100. So the number of distinct elements in the array is up to 100. So perhaps the solution can iterate over all possible pairs of distinct elements and find the best subarray for each pair.

But even with 100 elements, the pairs are 100 choose 2 = 4950 pairs. For each pair, we need to process the array in O(n) time. But for each pair, can we find the longest subarray where their counts are equal and all other elements' counts are <= that count?

But how to do that in O(n) time per pair.

An alternative approach for a pair (x, y) is to traverse the array and track the count of x and y. Whenever we have x and y counts equal, we can check the maximum count of any other element in the current window. If that maximum is <= count_x, then the window is valid. But how to track the maximum count of other elements in the window in O(1) time.

But tracking the maximum count of other elements is challenging. Because for each position, adding a new element could increase the count of some element other than x and y, which could affect the maximum.

But perhaps we can precompute for each position the elements that are not x or y and track their counts as we expand the window. However, this would require for each position, for each other element z, tracking their counts. Which is O(n * 100) per pair, which again is 2e7 per pair. Not feasible.

Alternative Idea:

Suppose we have a pair (x, y). Let's ignore other elements for a moment. The maximum possible subarray where x and y counts are equal would be when there's a balance between x and y. But this is not considering the other elements. So the maximum subarray for x and y, where counts are equal, is the longest such subarray. Then, within that subarray, we need to check if all other elements' counts are <= the count of x (which is equal to y's count).

So the approach could be:

For each pair (x, y):

1. Find all possible subarrays where x and y counts are equal. For each such subarray, check if all other elements in the subarray have counts <= count_x.

2. The longest valid subarray for this pair is the maximum length where the above conditions are met.

3. The overall answer is the maximum over all pairs.

So the steps are:

For each pair (x, y):

- Find the longest subarray where count(x) = count(y) and for all other z in the subarray, count(z) <= count(x).

Now, the problem reduces to how to find this efficiently for each pair.

How can we find the longest subarray where count(x) = count(y) and other elements' counts <= count(x)?

Let's model this with a sliding window approach.

We'll maintain a window [left, right], and for each step, we move right forward and track counts of x, y, and all other elements. We also need to track the maximum count of any other element in the current window.

If, for a certain window, count(x) == count(y) and max_other_count <= count(x), then we can consider this window as a candidate.

But maintaining max_other_count efficiently is challenging. How can we track the maximum count of any other element in the current window?

A possible way is to keep a frequency dictionary for all elements except x and y, and track the maximum value in this dictionary. However, inserting and deleting elements from this dictionary can be done in O(1) time, and maintaining the maximum requires O(1) time if we use a heap or some other structure. But a heap would not work because the maximum could change as elements are added or removed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can track the maximum as we update the counts. For example, when adding an element z (not x or y), we increase its count. If the new count is greater than the current max_other, then we update the max_other. Similarly, when removing elements, if the count of z decreases and it was the max_other, we need to recompute the max_other by iterating through all elements in the frequency dict.

But this recomputation when elements are removed could take O(100) time, which is manageable since 100 is small.

So here's the plan for each pair (x, y):

Initialize left=0, count_x=0, count_y=0, other_freq (a dictionary to track frequencies of elements not x or y), max_other=0.

For each right in 0 to n-1:

   if a[right] == x:
       count_x +=1
   elif a[right] == y:
       count_y +=1
   else:
       z = a[right]
       other_freq[z] = other_freq.get(z, 0) + 1
       if other_freq[z] > max_other:
           max_other = other_freq[z]

   Now, while (count_x != count_y) or (max_other > count_x):

       we need to move the left pointer forward to ensure the window is valid.

       So, while the current window is invalid, increment left:

       while left <= right and ( (count_x != count_y) or (max_other > count_x) ):

           if a[left] == x:
               count_x -=1
           elif a[left] == y:
               count_y -=1
           else:
               z = a[left]
               other_freq[z] -=1
               if other_freq[z] == 0:
                   del other_freq[z]
               # If the removed element was the max_other, recompute max_other
               if z == max_z_candidate:
                   if other_freq:
                       max_other = max(other_freq.values())
                   else:
                       max_other = 0

           left +=1

   Now, if the window is valid (count_x == count_y and max_other <= count_x), compute the length.

   If count_x >0 (since if count_x is zero, then max_other is also zero, but the window could be zero-length, which is not useful), then the window length is right - left +1.

   Update the maximum answer accordingly.

Wait, but how to handle the max_other when elements are removed. For example, when an element z is removed from the window and it was the one contributing to max_other, then we need to find the new maximum among the remaining elements. Since the elements are up to 100, and the other_freq dict has at most 98 elements (excluding x and y), recomputing max_other by taking the maximum of the values is O(100) time, which is acceptable.

But this would add O(100) operations per removal step. Since in the worst case, each step could require moving left all the way from 0 to right, this could be O(n^2) for each pair, which is again O(4950 * n^2) = way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So this suggests that the sliding window approach for each pair (x, y) is too slow.

Alternative Idea: Let's consider that for a valid subarray, the maximum other count is <= count_x (which is equal to count_y). So, for the entire subarray, the other elements' counts must be <= count_x. So count_x is at least the maximum of the other elements' counts.

So, for a pair (x, y), when their counts are equal, the maximum other elements' counts must be <= count_x. So, the maximum possible count_x is such that count_x >= max_other.

Thus, the problem for each pair (x, y) is to find the longest subarray where count_x = count_y >= max_other.

But how to model this.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem of finding the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s and no more than k other elements. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps for each pair (x, y), we can track the difference between the counts of x and y. When the difference is zero, we have a possible window. But we also need to track the maximum count of other elements in the window.

But again, it's unclear how to track this.

Another Idea: Since the other elements' counts can't exceed the count of x and y, perhaps the maximum possible count for x and y in the window is at least the maximum count of any other element. So, the sum of x and y counts is at least twice the maximum of the other elements' counts.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for a given pair (x, y), the best possible subarray is one where x and y are as frequent as possible, and other elements are as few as possible. So perhaps the optimal subarray for x and y would consist of x and y with as many occurrences as possible, and other elements that don't exceed their counts.

But again, not sure.

Another observation: The maximum possible answer can be up to n (the entire array) if the entire array meets the conditions. For example, if all elements are distinct, then the maximum frequency is 1, and since there are n elements, but each has frequency 1, there are multiple elements with frequency 1, so the answer would be n. But in the third sample input, the array has length 1. So the answer is zero.

But in general, the answer is the longest subarray where two elements share the maximum frequency.

Another Idea: Let's consider all elements and their frequencies in the entire array. For each element x, find all elements y with the same frequency as x. Then, the maximum possible subarray is the entire array if all other elements have frequencies <= x's frequency. But this is not necessarily true, because the subarray must be contiguous. So even if the entire array's x and y have the same frequency, the other elements' frequencies may be higher. For example, if the array is [1,1,2,2,3], then the entire array has frequencies 2,2,1. The maximum frequency is 2, and there are two elements. So the entire array would be valid, and the answer is 5.

But this is a case where the entire array is considered. So perhaps the solution can check if the entire array is valid. But the problem is that in some cases, the entire array is valid, but in others, a shorter subarray is needed.

But again, this approach may not cover all cases.

Alternative Idea: Since the maximum element value is 100, perhaps we can track for each element x, the list of indices where x occurs. Then, for each x, we can look for the longest possible subarray where there exists another element y such that in the subarray, x and y have the same count, and all other elements' counts are <= this count.

For example, for x and y, their occurrence lists are sorted. For each possible count f, we can check whether there's a subarray that includes exactly f occurrences of x and y, and all other elements in that subarray have counts <=f.

But how to find this efficiently.

For example, for x and y, their occurrence lists are sorted. We can iterate over all possible pairs of positions (i, j) in x's occurrence list and (k, l) in y's occurrence list such that the count of x between i and j is f, and the count of y between k and l is f, and the subarray from the first occurrence to the last occurrence of x and y includes all the f occurrences of x and y, and check if all other elements in this subarray have counts <=f.

But this seems computationally intensive.

Alternatively, for x and y, to find the longest possible subarray where x and y are each present exactly f times, and all other elements are present at most f times.

But how to model this.

Another Idea: The problem can be reduced to finding the longest subarray where the two most frequent elements have the same count. So perhaps, for each possible pair (x, y), the solution is to find the longest subarray where x and y are the two most frequent elements, and their counts are equal.

But again, the question is how to find this.

Let's think of a different approach. The problem requires that the maximum frequency in the subarray is not unique. So the subarray must have at least two elements with the same maximum frequency. So, the maximum frequency in the subarray is f, and there are at least two elements with frequency f.

The maximum possible length of such a subarray is the answer.

We can try to find the maximum f such that there exists a subarray where two elements have frequency f, and all other elements in the subarray have frequency <=f.

But how to find this f.

For each possible f, we can check if there exists a subarray where two elements have frequency f, and others have <=f.

But again, how to check this.

Another Idea: For each element x, track the positions where x occurs. For each occurrence of x, say at position i, we can look for a window around i where x has exactly f occurrences. Then, check if there's another element y that also has f occurrences in this window, and all others have <=f. But this is again computationally expensive.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a variation of the majority element problem. In the majority element problem, we look for elements that appear more than half of the time. Here, we need elements that appear exactly f times, and two of them share the same f.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea inspired by the solution of the problem where the answer is the longest subarray with at most two distinct elements: Perhaps the solution involves considering all possible pairs of elements and finding the maximum window for each pair, but with certain constraints.

But given that the elements are up to 100, this could be feasible. But how to model the constraints.

Here's a possible approach inspired by the solution to the "longest substring with at most two distinct elements" problem:

For each pair of elements x and y (x can be equal to y?), the solution would process the array and track the counts of x and y, along with the counts of other elements. But since the problem requires that all other elements have counts <= the maximum between x and y, which must be equal. So in this case, the maximum is the count of x (which is equal to y).

Wait, but x and y must have the same count. So for a window to be valid, x and y must have the same count, and other elements' counts must not exceed this count.

So the approach would be:

For each pair (x, y):

   Initialize left=0, count_x=0, count_y=0, other_counts (a dictionary for counts of other elements), max_other=0.

   For right in 0..n-1:

       if a[right] == x: count_x +=1

       elif a[right] == y: count_y +=1

       else: other_counts[a[right]] = other_counts.get(a[right], 0) +1

       max_other = max(other_counts.values()) if other_counts else 0

       current_f = max(count_x, count_y)

       while left <= right and (count_x != count_y or max_other > count_x):

           # need to move left to shrink the window

           if a[left] == x: count_x -=1

           elif a[left] == y: count_y -=1

           else:

               z = a[left]

               other_counts[z] -=1

               if other_counts[z] ==0: del other_counts[z]

               # if z was part of max_other, recompute max_other

               if z in other_counts:

                   if other_counts[z] +1 == max_other:

                       # the previous max_other might have been this z's count+1

                       if other_counts.values():

                           new_max = max(other_counts.values())

                       else:

                           new_max =0

                       if new_max < max_other:

                           max_other = new_max

               else:

                   if max_other == 1 and len(other_counts) ==0:

                       max_other =0

           left +=1

       # Now, if count_x == count_y and max_other <= count_x:

       if count_x == count_y and count_x >= max_other:

           current_length = right - left +1

           if current_length > best:

               best = current_length

So this approach for each pair (x, y) uses a sliding window and tracks the other elements' maximum count. The key here is that whenever the current window is invalid (count_x != count_y or other elements' count exceeds count_x), we move the left pointer to the right until the window is valid again.

But the problem is that in the worst case, for each pair, this is O(n) time. For 4950 pairs, this would be 4950 * 2e5 = 9.9e8 operations. Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second, so this would take about 10 seconds, which is way over the time limit of 2 seconds.

But wait, the time limit is 2 seconds. So we need to find a way to optimize this.

But maybe there's a smarter way. For example, if the number of pairs is manageable, but for each pair, the processing can be done efficiently.

Another Idea: Since the elements are up to 100, and in the worst case, each pair (x, y) is processed, but perhaps we can precompute the positions of each element and for each pair (x, y), process their occurrences in a way that allows us to quickly find the longest valid subarray.

For example, for pair (x, y), all their occurrences are in the array. We can process the array and for each occurrence of x or y, track the count difference between x and y. Then, for each position where the difference is zero, check if the other elements in the window have counts <= the current count.

But again, how to track the other elements' counts.

Alternative Idea: For each pair (x, y), when traversing the array, we can track the count of x and y, and track the earliest occurrence of a particular (count_x - count_y) value. Then, when the same difference is encountered, the subarray between these two positions has equal counts of x and y. Then, for this subarray, we need to check if the maximum other count is <= the count_x.

But how to check this.

For example, for each pair (x, y), we can track a hashmap that maps the difference between x and y counts to the earliest index where this difference occurred. As we iterate, we compute the current difference. If this difference is zero, then the current subarray from start to current index has x and y counts equal. Then, we need to check if all other elements in this subarray have counts <= count_x.

But this only checks the subarray from the start to current index. Which is not the only possibility. There could be a longer subarray in between where the difference is zero.

So this approach would miss other possible subarrays.

But if we track all possible differences, then when a difference is encountered again, the subarray between the previous index and current index has difference zero, and we can compute the count_x and count_y for that subarray.

But how to track the counts of other elements in that subarray.

This seems difficult. Because the subarray is between two indices, but the other elements' counts in that subarray are not tracked directly.

But maybe the maximum possible other count in the subarray can be determined by the initial and final indices. But that would require preprocessing for all possible elements and ranges, which is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Another Idea: The maximum other count in the subarray [l, r] for a pair (x, y) is the maximum frequency of any element except x and y in that subarray. To compute this quickly, we can precompute for each possible z (not x or y) a prefix sum array. Then for any subarray [l, r], the count of z is prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]. The maximum of these counts for all z (not x or y) would be the max_other for this subarray.

But for a pair (x, y), there are 98 possible other elements. So for each pair (x, y), to find the maximum other count in a subarray [l, r], we need to compute the maximum of (prefix_z[r] - prefix_z[l-1]) for all z not x or y.

But how to compute this maximum for a given l and r. This would take O(98) time per subarray, which is again O(98 * n^2) time for each pair, which is not feasible.

Hmm.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the answer is to consider all possible pairs of elements, and for each pair, find the longest possible subarray where the counts of these two elements are equal and the maximum of all other elements in the subarray is <= this count. Among all such pairs, the maximum length is the answer.

But the problem is, how to do this efficiently.

But perhaps for each pair (x, y), the maximum possible window where counts of x and y are equal and other elements' counts <= this count can be found by looking for the positions where the difference between x and y counts is zero, and the other elements' counts up to that point do not exceed the current count_x.

But how to track the other elements' counts.

Wait, perhaps we can precompute for each position the counts of all elements. Then, for any subarray [l, r], the counts of x, y, and other elements can be computed by subtracting the prefix sums. But again, the problem is that for each possible pair (x, y) and each possible subarray [l, r], we need to compute the counts of x, y, and other elements and check if x and y counts are equal and other elements' counts are <= x's count.

But this is O(n^2) for each pair, which is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for hints or think of a different approach.

Wait, the problem requires the subarray to have at least two elements with the maximum frequency. So the maximum frequency in the subarray must be shared by at least two elements. So the subarray's frequency distribution must have at least two elements with the highest frequency.

So, for example, if a subarray has elements with frequencies 3,3,2, then the maximum frequency is 3, and two elements have this frequency. So it's valid.

So another approach could be to iterate over all possible subarrays and track the frequency distribution. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

But given the constraints on a_i (up to 100), perhaps the number of distinct elements in the array is limited to 100, which could be used for optimization.

Another Idea: For each element x, track the positions where x occurs. Then, for each occurrence of x, look for the earliest and latest occurrence of another element y such that between these positions, x and y have the same count. Then, check if all other elements in this window have counts <= the count of x and y.

But again, this seems computationally expensive.

Alternatively, for each element x, find the positions where x's frequency is increasing. For each such position, track the earliest position where y's frequency matches x's frequency. Then, check for the other elements.

But not sure.

Alternatively, let's look for patterns in the sample inputs.

First sample input:

1 1 2 2 3 3 3.

The answer is 6: the first six elements. Here, each of 1, 2, and 3 occurs twice. So the maximum frequency is 2, and three elements share it.

Second sample input:

1 1 1 5 4 1 3 1 2 2.

The answer is 7. The subarray is positions 0-6 (assuming 0-based), elements 1,1,1,5,4,1,3. Here, 1 occurs 4 times, 5,4,3 once each. So the maximum frequency is 4. But then this isn't shared. Wait, perhaps the correct subarray is different.

Wait, the second sample's output is 7. Let's look at the explanation. The valid subarray is of length 7. For example, maybe the subarray starts at 3 and ends at 9? Or another possibility. Let's see.

The input is:

1 1 1 5 4 1 3 1 2 2.

The output is 7. So the subarray is length 7. Let's see:

Looking for a subarray where two elements have the same maximum frequency.

For example, the subarray from index 3 to 9 is 5,4,1,3,1,2,2. The counts are:

1: 2, 5:1,4:1,3:1,2:2. So two elements (1 and 2) have count 2. So this is valid. The length is 7. So this is one possible subarray.

But how was this found by the algorithm.

Another Idea: For each possible pair of elements (x, y), track the positions where their count difference is zero. For each such position, find the maximum possible window where the other elements' counts do not exceed the count of x (which equals y's count). This could be done using a two-pointer approach.

But how to efficiently track the other elements' counts.

Perhaps, for each pair (x, y), the following steps can be taken:

1. Iterate through the array and track the count of x and y, and for each other element, track their counts.

2. Whenever the count of x equals the count of y, check if all other elements' counts are <= this count. If yes, record the window length.

3. Use a sliding window approach to maintain the window where count_x == count_y and max_other <= count_x.

But this again brings us back to the earlier problem of tracking the max_other.

But perhaps, given that the elements are up to 100, the max_other can be tracked efficiently using a frequency array.

Let's try to model this.

For each pair (x, y):

Initialize:

- count_x = 0, count_y = 0

- freq array (size 101) initialized to 0 (tracks the count of each other element)

- max_other = 0

- left = 0

For right from 0 to n-1:

   current element is a[right]

   if a[right] == x:

       count_x +=1

   elif a[right] == y:

       count_y +=1

   else:

       z = a[right]

       freq[z] +=1

       if freq[z] > max_other:

           max_other = freq[z]

   Now, while (count_x != count_y) or (max_other > count_x):

       element at left is a[left]

       if a[left] == x:

           count_x -=1

       elif a[left] == y:

           count_y -=1

       else:

           z = a[left]

           freq[z] -=1

           if freq[z] == max_other -1:

               # check if max_other should decrease

               # find new max_other

               new_max = 0

               for i in range(1, 101):

                   if i == x or i == y:

                       continue

                   if freq[i] > new_max:

                       new_max = freq[i]

               max_other = new_max

       left +=1

   if count_x == count_y and count_x >= max_other:

       current_length = right - left +1

       update the answer if current_length is larger.

But in this approach, the 'for' loop to find new_max is O(100) for each time an element is removed that was part of the previous max_other. But this could be too slow.

But in practice, when elements are removed from the left, this 'for' loop would only be triggered when the element being removed was part of the previous max_other. So, in the worst case, for each step, this loop could be O(100) per pair, which for 4950 pairs and 2e5 steps is 4950 * 2e5 * 100 = 9.9e10 operations. Which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to find a different approach.

Wait, another observation: The answer is at least the length of the longest possible subarray where two elements have the same frequency and are the two most frequent elements.

But how to find such subarrays.

Another Idea: For each element x, track the positions where x occurs. Then, for each occurrence of x, look for another occurrence of x such that between them, there are exactly f occurrences of x and y. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, for each element x, find all elements y that occur at least as frequently as x in some subarray, and see if there's a subarray where x and y have the same count.

But again, not sure.

Alternative Idea inspired by the first sample: The maximum possible answer is when the subarray has all elements with the same frequency. For example, the first sample's subarray has all elements with frequency 2. So the maximum frequency is 2, and three elements share it. So the answer is 6.

So perhaps the solution is to find the longest subarray where all elements have the same frequency. Then, if there are at least two elements, this is a candidate.

But how to find such subarrays.

But this is not sufficient. For example, the second sample's answer is a subarray where two elements have frequency 4, but others have lower frequencies.

Wait, in the second sample's valid subarray, the count of 1 is 4, and the count of 2 is 2. So perhaps the idea of all elements having the same frequency is not the only way to get a valid subarray.

Hmm. So this approach is not sufficient.

Another Idea: For the entire array, find the two elements with the highest frequencies. If their frequencies are equal, then the entire array is a candidate. Otherwise, look for a subarray where their frequencies are equal and others are <=.

But this also might not work.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a different approach.

Let's think about the problem in terms of the frequencies of elements in a subarray. The maximum frequency must be at least 2, and there must be at least two elements with this frequency.

So, the solution must find a subarray where this condition is met.

Another Idea: For each possible frequency f, check if there exists a subarray where two elements have frequency f, and others have <=f. The maximum such f gives the longest possible subarray.

For example, in the first sample, f=2 is possible. The subarray has three elements with f=2. The length is 6.

So the algorithm could:

For f from the maximum possible down to 1:

   For each possible pair of elements (x, y), check if there exists a subarray where x and y occur f times each, and other elements occur <=f times.

   If such a subarray exists, return the length as 2f + sum of other elements (each <=f). The maximum possible length would be when the sum of other elements is as large as possible.

But how to find this.

But again, the question is how to check for each pair (x, y) and frequency f.

But perhaps for each pair (x, y), we can find the earliest positions where x and y each have f occurrences. Then, the subarray between their first and last occurrences would include these f occurrences, and the other elements' counts must be <=f.

But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, for each pair (x, y), the maximum possible f is the minimum of the total occurrences of x and y in the entire array. For each f from 1 to this minimum, check if there's a subarray where x and y occur f times, and others' counts are <=f.

But this is also time-consuming.

Another Idea: The optimal subarray must have two elements with the same maximum frequency. So, for each pair (x, y), the maximum frequency of x and y in the subarray must be equal and must be >= the frequency of any other element in the subarray.

Thus, the solution is to consider all pairs (x, y) and find the longest subarray where x and y's frequencies are equal and all other elements' frequencies are <= that.

But the problem is how to compute this efficiently.

At this point, I'm going to look for hints or think of what others might have done for similar problems.

Researching similar problems: There's a problem called "Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters", which can be solved with a sliding window. Another problem is "Longest Subarray with Maximum Frequency of K", which requires that the maximum frequency is at least K. But our problem is different.

Another approach inspired by the first sample: The longest valid subarray may be formed by alternating elements such that the counts of two elements are equal. For example, 1,1,2,2,3,3. So the counts are 2,2,2. This gives a valid subarray.

So perhaps the solution is to look for the longest sequence where two elements alternate and accumulate equal counts. But this approach may miss other valid cases.

Another Idea: Since the elements are up to 100, perhaps for each element x, we can track the positions where x occurs and then, for each possible frequency f, check if there's another element y that also has f occurrences in a certain window. For example, for x and y, their occurrence lists are sorted. For each occurrence of x at position i, and occurrence of y at position j, we can find the earliest and latest positions where x and y each have f occurrences.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, here's a possible solution inspired by the problem's constraints:

The maximum possible value of an element is 100, which is small. So for each element x, we can track all the positions where x occurs. Then, for each x, and for each possible y (y !=x), we can check if there exists a subarray where x and y have the same count, and other elements' counts are <= that count.

To find this, for each pair (x, y), we can use their occurrence lists. For example, x occurs at positions x_pos = [x1, x2, ..., xk], and y occurs at y_pos = [y1, y2, ..., ym].

We can find all possible f where f is up to the minimum of k and m. For each f, find the earliest and latest possible subarray that includes f occurrences of x and y. Then, check if in this subarray, all other elements have counts <=f.

The length of such a subarray would be (last_x - first_x +1) + (last_y - first_y +1) - ... Not sure.

Alternatively, for f occurrences of x and y, the subarray must start at the minimum of the f-th occurrence of x and y, and end at the maximum of the f-th occurrence of x and y. Wait, no. For example, if x occurs at positions 0, 2, 4, and y occurs at positions 1, 3, 5, then for f=2, the subarray must include x's first two occurrences (0, 2) and y's first two (1, 3). The subarray must start at 0 and end at 3 to include these occurrences. But the other elements in between are 1 and 3, which are y's and x's. So other elements would be x and y. But wait, the other elements in the array could be different.

But in this case, the subarray is from 0 to 3, which contains x at 0 and 2, y at 1 and 3. So count_x=2, count_y=2. Other elements (if any) would have counts <=2.

But this approach is not considering the other elements in the array. For example, if between 0 and 3 there's a element z that occurs 3 times, then this subarray is invalid.

So this approach is not sufficient.

Another Idea: The only way to efficiently handle the other elements' counts is to realize that during the sliding window approach, the other elements' maximum count can be tracked by maintaining a frequency array and a variable that tracks the current maximum.

But in Python, even with O(1) operations for each step, for 4950 pairs and 2e5 steps, it's 9.9e8 operations, which may be manageable if the code is optimized. But in practice, Python's speed may not be sufficient.

But perhaps the code can be optimized to pass within the time constraints.

Let's try to proceed with this approach.

The plan is:

1. Iterate over all pairs (x, y) where x < y (to avoid duplicates).

2. For each pair, use a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray where:

   a. count_x == count_y.

   b. all other elements in the window have counts <= count_x.

3. Keep track of the maximum length found.

The key is to implement this efficiently.

Now, to manage the other elements' maximum count, we can use a frequency array (size 101) and track the current maximum.

Here's how to implement the sliding window for a pair (x, y):

Initialize:

- left = 0

- count_x = 0

- count_y = 0

- other_freq = [0] * 101 (indices 1-100)

- max_other = 0

- max_length = 0

Iterate over right in range(n):

   current_element = a[right]

   if current_element == x:

       count_x +=1

   elif current_element == y:

       count_y +=1

   else:

       z = current_element

       other_freq[z] +=1

       if other_freq[z] > max_other:

           max_other = other_freq[z]

   Now, while left <= right and (count_x != count_y or max_other > count_x):

       # Need to move left pointer to make window valid.

       removed_element = a[left]

       if removed_element == x:

           count_x -=1

       elif removed_element == y:

           count_y -=1

       else:

           z = removed_element

           other_freq[z] -=1

           # If the removed element was the max_other, check if we need to recompute max_other.

           if other_freq[z] == max_other -1 and max_other == other_freq[z] +1:

               # The previous max_other was possibly this element's count +1.

               # So recompute max_other.

               new_max = 0

               for i in range(1, 101):

                   if i == x or i == y:

                       continue

                   if other_freq[i] > new_max:

                       new_max = other_freq[i]

               max_other = new_max

       left +=1

   # After the loop, the window is valid.

   if count_x == count_y and count_x >= max_other:

       current_length = right - left +1

       if current_length > max_length:

           max_length = current_length

After processing all right positions, update the global answer with max_length for this pair.

Repeat for all pairs (x, y), and also for pairs (x, x) if x appears more than once? No, because x and y must be different.

Wait, no. The pair must be two different elements. So x and y are distinct.

Thus, for each pair (x, y) where x != y.

But in the code, the pairs are all possible ordered pairs. So to avoid duplicates, we can process unordered pairs.

But in the code, for each x in 1..100, and for each y in x+1..100.

But the code's time complexity is O( (100 choose 2) * n ) = 4950 * 2e5 = 9.9e8 operations. In Python, this might be possible if the code is optimized.

But the inner loop (the while loop) could have O(n) steps per pair, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.

But in practice, for each pair (x, y), the left pointer moves from 0 to n once, so the total number of operations is O(n) per pair.

Thus, the total time is O(4950 * n) = 9.9e8, which is tight but might pass if the code is optimized.

But in Python, 1e9 operations are about 1 second. So 9.9e8 is about 1 second. But with some overhead from the loops and the inner computation of max_other, it might be tight.

But the code must be optimized.

Let's see the steps to optimize:

- Precompute all possible pairs (x, y) where x < y.

- For each pair, process the array once.

- For the other elements' frequency tracking, use a list of size 101 to avoid dictionary lookups.

- When recomputing max_other, iterate from 1 to 100, skipping x and y. This is O(100) per recalculation.

But how often do we need to recalculate max_other? Only when the removed element was contributing to the previous max_other. So, for example, if the previous max_other was 3, and the removed element's count was 3, after decrementing, it's now 2. So we need to check if there are any other elements with 3 occurrences. If not, the new max_other is 2.

But recomputing the max_other each time this happens can be done by iterating over all possible elements (100 steps), which is manageable.

Now, let's think about the sample input 1.

Sample input 1: 7 elements. 1,1,2,2,3,3,3.

Pairs to consider include (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

For pair (1,2):

As the window is processed, count_x and count_y are tracked. The valid window would be when their counts are equal. For example, in the first four elements (1,1,2,2), counts are 2 and 2. Other elements (3) are not present. So max_other is 0. So this window is valid. The length is 4.

But the pair (1,3) and (2,3) would also have valid windows.

But the maximum length is 6, which is achieved when all three elements are present with counts 2.

But in this case, for the pair (1,2), the maximum window would be 4 elements. For pair (1,3), their counts would be 2 each, and the other elements (2) would have 2 counts. So the window would be 6 elements. Similarly for pair (2,3).

Thus, the code would find this maximum length.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's implement this approach.

But first, how to iterate over all possible pairs (x, y) where x and y are distinct elements present in the array.

Wait, but in the array, there could be elements that don't appear. So, for example, if the array contains elements 1, 2, 3, then the pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

But in the code, for each possible x and y in the range 1 to 100 (since a_i <= 100), whether they are present in the array or not. Because even if x is not present in the array, the code will process it but find no valid subarrays. So, it's better to iterate over all possible pairs (x, y) where x < y and x and y are in the possible value range (1 to 100). But since the array elements can be up to 100, this is manageable.

But to optimize, we can first find all unique elements in the array, and iterate over pairs of those. But the code can handle it either way.

So, in code:

Read n and the array.

Initialize the answer as 0.

Generate all possible pairs (x, y) where x < y and x and y are in 1 to 100.

For each pair (x, y):

   process the array using the sliding window approach.

   update the answer with the maximum length found for this pair.

Finally, output the answer.

Now, the code.

But to handle all possible pairs efficiently, we can loop x in 1 to 100, and y in x+1 to 100.

Thus, in Python:

for x in range(1, 101):
    for y in range(x+1, 101):
        # process pair (x, y)

But this would generate 100*99/2 = 4950 pairs.

Now, the code for processing each pair:

Initialize left = 0, count_x =0, count_y=0, other_freq as a list of zeros for each possible element (1-100), and max_other =0.

Then, iterate over each element in the array.

For each element in the array:

if the element is x, increment count_x.

elif it's y, increment count_y.

else:

   increment other_freq[element].

   update max_other if needed.

Then, the while loop to adjust left.

After the loop, if count_x == count_y and max_other <= count_x:

   current_length is right - left +1.

   update max_length.

But in code, how to handle other_freq. Since the elements are from 1 to 100, we can use a list of size 101 (indices 0-100).

But the initial other_freq is a list of zeros.

Then, when processing elements not x or y:

z = a[right]

other_freq[z] +=1

if other_freq[z] > max_other:

   max_other = other_freq[z]

When moving left:

if the element is not x or y:

   other_freq[z] -=1

   if other_freq[z] +1 == max_other:

       # the previous max_other was other_freq[z] +1.

       # now, check if this is still the case.

       # recompute max_other.

       new_max = 0

       for i in range(1, 101):

           if i == x or i == y:

               continue

           if other_freq[i] > new_max:

               new_max = other_freq[i]

       max_other = new_max

This is the critical part: when an element that was part of the max_other is removed, we need to recompute the max_other.

But this loop is 100 iterations per occurrence. However, this loop is executed only when the element being removed was part of the previous max_other. So, for example, if the previous max_other was 5, and we remove an element that had count 5, thus reducing it to 4, then we need to check if there are any elements with count 5. If not, the new max_other is 4.

But this is only triggered when the removed element was part of the max_other.

Now, in code:

Implementing this for each pair (x, y).

But with 4950 pairs, this is going to be time-consuming.

But perhaps the code can be optimized by precomputing the list of elements present in the array for each pair (x, y), and only iterate through those elements when recomputing max_other. But this would require tracking the possible elements, which may not be worth it.

Alternatively, use a faster way to track the maximum other count.

But in Python, for loops are relatively slow. So this part of the code could be a bottleneck.

Another optimization: precompute the set of all elements in the array, and during the recomputing of max_other, only iterate through these elements. But since elements can be up to 100, this may not help much.

But in the code, during the recomputation of max_other, we can iterate from 1 to 100, which is manageable.

Thus, the code for each pair (x, y):

max_length = 0

left = 0

count_x = 0

count_y = 0

other_freq = [0] * 101

max_other = 0

for right in range(n):

    current = a[right]

    if current == x:

        count_x +=1

    elif current == y:

        count_y +=1

    else:

        other_freq[current] +=1

        if other_freq[current] > max_other:

            max_other = other_freq[current]

    # Shrink the window

    while left <= right and (count_x != count_y or max_other > count_x):

        removed = a[left]

        if removed == x:

            count_x -=1

        elif removed == y:

            count_y -=1

        else:

            other_freq[removed] -=1

            # Check if the removed element was part of the max_other

            if other_freq[removed] +1 == max_other:

                # Recompute max_other

                new_max = 0

                for i in range(1, 101):

                    if i == x or i == y:

                        continue

                    if other_freq[i] > new_max:

                        new_max = other_freq[i]

                max_other = new_max

        left +=1

    # Update max_length if valid

    if count_x == count_y and count_x >= max_other and (count_x + count_y) > 0:

        current_length = right - left +1

        if current_length > max_length:

            max_length = current_length

if max_length > answer:

    answer = max_length

Thus, this code will process each pair (x, y) and compute the maximum valid subarray length for that pair.

Finally, after processing all pairs, the answer is output.

But what about the case where the maximum subarray has more than two elements with the same maximum frequency? For example, three elements each with frequency f. In this case, the code will still capture this when processing pairs of those elements. For example, in the first sample, when processing pair (1, 2), the code will find a window where count_1 = count_2 = 2, and other elements (3) have counts 2, which is equal to count_1 and count_2. Thus, the max_other is 2, which is <= count_1 (which is 2). So the window is valid. The length is 6.

Thus, the code should capture all such cases.

Sample input 3:

1

1

The pairs are all possible pairs (x, y) where x < y and x and y are between 1 and 100. But since the array has only 1, the code would process pairs like (1,2), (1,3), etc. For each pair, the array has no elements of x and y. Thus, count_x and count_y are zero, and the code would not update the max_length. So the answer remains 0.

Thus, the code should find this window.

But how? Let's see:

When processing pair (1, 2), the window would expand to include positions 3-9. count_x (1) is 2, count_y (2) is 2. The other elements (5,4,3) have counts 1 each, so max_other is 1, which is <=2. Thus, the window is valid. The length is 7.

Thus, the code would capture this.

Thus, the code should work for all samples.

Now, let's write the code.
