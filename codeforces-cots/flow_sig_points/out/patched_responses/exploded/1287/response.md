Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible minimum number of slices each pupil gets. Hmm.

First, let's understand the problem. We have n tangerines, each with a_i slices. We need to divide these into parts such that each of the k pupils gets exactly one part. The way to split is by dividing a part into two equal (or as equal as possible if odd) parts. And we can't split a part that's just one slice. The goal is to maximize the minimum b_i, where b_i is the slices each pupil gets.

So the question is: what's the largest x such that we can split the tangerines into at least k parts, each of which is at least x slices. And then among those possible x's, the maximum possible is our answer.

This sounds like a classic binary search problem. Because binary search can efficiently find the maximum x where the condition (having enough parts >= x) is satisfied.

Let's think about how to model the condition check. For each a_i, how many parts of size at least x can we get from it? The sum of all these parts across all a_i must be >=k.

But how do we compute the number of parts for a given a_i and x?

For a single a_i, the maximum number of parts we can split into, each at least x, depends on how many splits we can perform. Let's think recursively. Each split can break a piece into two parts. But each split must be done in such a way that the parts are as equal as possible. Wait, but when considering the maximum number of parts >=x, maybe there's a way to model this without considering the actual splitting steps.

Alternatively, for a given x, the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained from a_i where each piece is >=x is equal to how many times you can split a_i into parts, such that each part is at least x. But the splitting process may have certain constraints based on how the splits are done.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a function. For a given a_i, the maximum number of parts >=x is the maximum m such that when you split a_i into m parts (via successive splitting steps), each part is >=x. So how to compute this m?

Hmm. Let's think of it as for a_i, what's the maximum possible number of parts m where each part is >=x, and m is a possible split count.

Wait, when you split a piece into two, each split increases the number of pieces by one. So for a_i, the initial count is 1. Each split adds one. So the total number of pieces after s splits is 1 + s.

But how do these splits affect the sizes?

But perhaps for a given a_i and x, the maximum number of pieces we can split into (each >=x) is the largest possible m such that a_i can be divided into m parts, each of size >=x, considering the splitting rules.

But the splitting rules complicate things. Because each split must divide a piece into two parts as equally as possible. For example, if the piece is 5, splitting into 3 and 2. Then each of those can be split again, but only if they are more than 1 slice.

Alternatively, maybe the way to model this is that for a given a_i and x, the maximum number of parts >=x is the maximum possible m such that m is a sum of 2^d terms, where each term is the number of splits applied, and each split divides a piece into two parts, each of which is at least x.

Wait, maybe there's a mathematical way to compute this. Let's think of the problem as follows: For a given a_i, the maximum number of pieces (m_i) we can get that are each at least x. Then the sum of all m_i across all tangerines must be >=k. Our task is to find the maximum x where this holds.

But how to compute m_i for a given a_i and x?

Hmm. Let's think recursively. For a piece of size s, if s <x: then it's 0. If s >=x, then the maximum number of pieces is 1 + sum of the pieces from splitting it into two parts. Wait, but splitting into two parts may allow each part to be split further. But this approach would be too slow for large a_i. So we need an O(1) or O(log a_i) way to compute m_i.

Alternatively, maybe for a given x, the maximum number of pieces we can split a_i into is the maximum m such that when you divide a_i into m parts, each part is at least x, and m is a power of 2. Or is there a pattern here?

Wait, the splitting process is such that each split can generate parts that can be split further. For example, a piece of size 9 can be split into 5 and 4. Then the 5 can be split into 3 and 2, the 4 into 2 and 2. So for x=2, the 9 can be split into 3 parts (5,3,2, but wait, no, after splitting 9 into 5 and 4, then splitting 5 into 3 and 2 (each >=2), then 4 into 2 and 2. So total parts from 9 would be 1 (original) + 3 splits (each split adds one part). So 4 parts. But each part is >=2. So for x=2, m_i would be 4.

But how do we model this?

Another approach: For a given s (current slice count), and x, the maximum number of pieces we can split s into is:

If s <x: 0

Else:

We can split s into two parts: a and b, where a is ceil(s/2), b is floor(s/2). Then the maximum number of pieces from s is 1 (the current piece) plus the sum of the maximum pieces from a and b, but only if a >=x and b >=x. Wait, no. Because when you split s, it becomes two parts. So each split adds one piece. So for example, s can be split into a and b. The total pieces would be the sum of the pieces from a and the pieces from b, but each split adds a piece.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of pieces for s is 1 (if s >=x and cannot be split into two parts each >=x) or 1 + the sum of the pieces from splitting into a and b.

Wait, no. Because when you split s into a and b, you have two pieces. Each of those can be split further if possible. So the maximum pieces from s is:

if s <x: 0

else:

max_pieces = 1 (if we can't split further)

or, split into a and b. Then the total pieces would be (max_pieces from a) + (max_pieces from b).

But this approach is recursive and would be O(s) time, which is impossible for s up to 1e7.

So we need a way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe for each s and x, the maximum number of pieces is the maximum m such that s can be divided into m parts, each of which is at least x, and the parts are formed by splitting as per the rules.

Wait, but how to compute that m?

Hmm. Let's think of the process as a tree. Each split creates two children. The leaves of this tree are the parts that are not split further. All leaves must be >=x and cannot be split (either because they are 1 or splitting them would result in parts smaller than x).

But this is again not efficient to compute for large s. So we need a mathematical way to model this.

Wait, here's an observation: when you split s into a and b (a >=b), the maximum number of parts you can get from s is 1 if you don't split s, or (if you split) the sum of the maximum parts from a and b. But this is only possible if a >=x and b >=x. So for s >=x, the maximum m is 1 (if splitting s would result in parts less than x) or 1 + m(a) + m(b) - 1. Wait, no. Because when you split s into a and b, that's two parts, so each part's count is added. So for example, if a can be split into m_a parts and b into m_b parts, then the total for s is m_a + m_b. But this is only possible if a and b are >=x. If you split s into a and b, but a is >=x and b is >=x, then the total is m_a + m_b. But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pieces is determined by the number of times you can split s into two parts, each of which is >=x. Each split increases the count by 1. So for example, if s can be split once into a and b (each >=x), and each of those can be split once again, the total is 1 (original) +1 (split s) + 1 (split a) + 1 (split b) ? Wait, no. Each split of a piece increases the count by 1. So if s is split into a and b: that's 2 pieces. Then splitting a into a1 and a2 adds another piece (total 3), etc.

But this approach would require considering each split and the count. Which is not feasible for large s.

Hmm. Let's think of the maximum number of pieces m that can be generated from s, each >=x.

Each split of a piece into two parts (each >=x) adds 1 to the total count.

So, the maximum possible m is the maximum number of splits possible for s, given that every split must result in parts >=x.

But how to model this?

Wait, perhaps the maximum m is the largest number such that s can be split into m pieces, each >=x. But each split must be possible according to the rules.

Alternatively, for a given s and x, the maximum m is the largest possible where each piece after all splits is >=x, and the sum of all the pieces is s.

But perhaps this is equivalent to splitting s into m parts such that each part is >=x and the sum is s. But that's not considering the splitting rules. So for example, for s=5 and x=3, the maximum m is 1 (since splitting 5 into 3 and 2, but 2 <3. So the only way is to leave it as 5, giving m=1).

But according to the problem's first example, when x=5, the 9 is split into 5 and 4. So for x=5, the maximum pieces from 9 is 2 (since both 5 and 4 are >=5? Wait, no, 4 is not >=5. So that can't be. Wait, the first example says that the second tangerine (9) is split into two parts of 5 and 4, but then the 4 is not given to any pupil. Wait, but the problem says that Santa can choose which parts to give. So perhaps in that case, the maximum number of parts from 9 that are >=5 is 1 (the 5 part). But then, the 9 is split into 5 and 4, and only the 5 is used, while the 4 is left. But the first example's input is 3 2, 5,9,3. So the two pupils get 5 and 5. The 9 is split into 5 and 4, but only one part is used (the 5). So the sum of m_i for x=5 would be:

5: can be 1 (since >=5)

9: split into 5 (used) and 4 (unused). So m_i is 1.

3: can't be split (3 <5). So m_i is 0.

Total sum is 1+1+0=2, which equals k=2. So that's acceptable.

But according to this, the way to compute m_i for a given a_i and x is the maximum number of parts >=x that can be obtained from a_i, possibly by splitting in any way, and then choosing the parts to sum up to at least k.

So how do we compute m_i?

Wait, perhaps m_i is the maximum number of parts >=x that can be obtained from a_i. For example, in the first example, a_i=9 and x=5: you can split into 5 and 4, so one part is >=5. Then that's m_i=1. But can you split further? The 5 can't be split (since 5 split into 3 and 2, both <5). So m_i=1.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to split into more parts. For example, if a_i=12, x=6. Then splitting 12 into 6 and 6: m_i=2. So for x=6, a_i=12 gives m_i=2. So how do we compute that?

So the problem is for each a_i and x, compute the maximum possible number of parts >=x that can be obtained from a_i.

Let me think of a way to compute this.

Let's model the function m(s, x) as the maximum number of parts >=x that can be obtained from a piece of size s.

The base case is if s <x: return 0.

If s >=x, then we can take this piece as one part (so m=1). Or, we can split it into two parts, a and b (a >=b), and then the maximum m is m(a, x) + m(b, x). But if either a or b is less than x, then splitting is not allowed (since splitting s into a and b would leave one part <x, which can't be used). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the split must divide a part into two parts, even if one is less than x. But when you split s into a and b, each must be >=x. Otherwise, the split is not allowed. Wait, no.

The split operation is allowed even if one of the resulting parts is less than x, but then that part cannot be used for further splits (since once you split a part, you can't split parts that are 1 slice, and also if the part is split into a and b, but a is <x, then it's not allowed to split further. But in the calculation of m(s, x), we need to count how many parts are >=x. So even if splitting s into a and b, where a >=x and b <x, then the count is m(a, x) + 0 (since b is <x). But in this case, the split would not be allowed because after splitting, the resulting parts must be such that each can be split again if possible. Wait, no: the split is allowed as long as the part is not 1 slice. So for example, a part of size 3 can be split into 2 and 1. But 1 cannot be split further. So for x=2, the split would result in 2 (>=x) and 1 (less than x). So for that split, we would count 1 part from the 2, and none from the 1. So the total would be 1. But if we don't split, the original part is 3, which is >=x=2. So m(3,2) would be max(1, 1) =1. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the split can be done even if one of the resulting parts is less than x, but in that case, that part cannot be split further, and thus can't contribute to m. So when considering splitting s into a and b, we can only split if both a and b are >=x. Because otherwise, one part is invalid and cannot be used. Wait, no. Because the split is allowed, but the part that is <x can't be split further, but if it's >=x, then it can be used as a part. So for example, if s=5 and x=3. Split into 3 and 2. Then the 3 can be a part (counts as 1), and the 2 can't be split (so not counted if x=3). So m(5,3) would be 1. But if we don't split, then the 5 is a valid part (counts as 1). So the maximum is 1.

But what if s=6 and x=3. Split into 3 and 3. Each part is >=3. So m(6,3) is 2. And each can be split again, but since splitting 3 would result in 2 and 1 (which are <3), so the maximum is 2.

Another example: s=9, x=5. Split into 5 and 4. 5 is >=5 (counts as 1), 4 <5 (counts as 0). So m(9,5) is 1. Alternatively, if you don't split, it's 1. So m is 1.

So the way to compute m(s, x) is:

if s <x: return 0.

else, the maximum between taking s as one part (1) or splitting into two parts a and b, and adding their m(a, x) and m(b, x).

But splitting is only allowed if a and b are >=1 (i.e., can split any part except size 1). But when splitting, regardless of whether a or b is >=x, the split is allowed. But the parts that are <x cannot contribute to the count.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, when you split a part, you can split it into two parts as equal as possible. Even if the resulting parts are smaller than x. But in that case, those parts are not usable as parts for the pupils (since each pupil must get at least x slices). So when calculating m(s, x), after splitting s into a and b, you can split a and/or b only if they can contribute to parts >=x.

So the function m(s, x) is:

m(s, x) = max(1, split a into m(a, x) + m(b, x)).

But the split is possible even if a or b is less than x, but their m would be 0. So the split is allowed as long as the part to split is larger than 1.

Wait, but the split can't be done if the part is 1 (since you can't split a part of 1 slice). But when calculating m(s, x), the splitting steps are allowed as per the rules. So for example, you can split a part into a and b as long as the part is not 1 slice. So for a part s, even if splitting it into a and b where a <x and b <x, you can split it, but those parts can't be used (so m(s, x) would be 0 in that case, but you can't split s if s is 1).

But how does this affect the calculation? Let's think.

So, for a given s and x, the function is:

if s <x: return 0.

else:

max_parts = 1 (taking the current piece as a part)

if s can be split (s >1):

split into a = ceil(s/2), b = floor(s/2)

if a >=x and b >=x:

max_parts = max(max_parts, m(a, x) + m(b, x))

else if a >=x:

max_parts = max(max_parts, m(a, x) + 0)  # because b <x, so m(b, x) is 0

else if b >=x:

max_parts = max(max_parts, 0 + m(b, x))  # but a is >=b, so if b >=x, a must be >=x?

Wait, no. For example, s=5, split into 3 and 2. x=3. Then a=3 >=x, but b=2 <x. So m(5,3) is max(1, m(3,3) + m(2,3)). m(3,3) is 1, m(2,3) is 0. So sum is 1. So max between 1 and 1: 1.

Another example: s=4, x=2. Split into 2 and 2. Both are >=x. So m(4,2) = m(2,2) + m(2,2) = 1 +1 =2.

So the function m(s, x) can be computed as follows:

if s <x: 0

else:

split into a and b.

sum_split = 0

if a >=x: sum_split += m(a, x)

if b >=x: sum_split += m(b, x)

max_parts = max(1, sum_split)

So m(s, x) is the maximum between 1 (using the current piece) and the sum of the splits (if you split, how many parts >=x you can get from the two splits).

But how to compute this efficiently for large s (up to 1e7) and multiple a_i?

If we use recursion with memoization, it's not feasible. For a_i up to 1e7 and n up to 1e6, this approach would be O(n * log a_i), which is manageable if each m(a_i, x) can be computed in O(log a_i) time.

But implementing this recursively would be too slow. So we need to find an iterative way, perhaps using memoization via a dictionary, but even that may not be efficient for 1e6 a_i and each a_i up to 1e7.

Alternatively, there's a mathematical pattern here. Let's think: For a given x, how many parts can be split from s?

Let's model this as follows:

For s >=x, the maximum number of parts is the maximum between 1 (not splitting) and the sum of the parts from splitting. But the split is allowed only if s is not 1. Wait, but in the splitting process, we can split any part except those of size 1.

But the problem allows splitting any existing part as long as it's not 1. So during the splitting steps, any part larger than 1 can be split again.

But the way to model the maximum parts is to consider that each split can generate more parts, but only if the resulting parts are >=x.

Hmm. Let's try to find a formula for m(s, x).

Suppose s >=x. Then:

If s is even, splitting into s/2 and s/2. Each of these can be split again if s/2 >=x.

So m(s, x) = 2 * m(s/2, x)

If s is odd, splitting into (s+1)/2 and (s-1)/2. So m(s, x) = m((s+1)/2, x) + m((s-1)/2, x).

But wait, this is the same as the recursive approach. For example, s=5, x=3. Then:

m(5,3) = m(3,3) + m(2,3) = 1 + 0 =1.

Which matches the earlier example.

Another example, s=9, x=5: split into 5 and 4.

m(9,5) = m(5,5) + m(4,5) = 1 + 0 =1.

Which matches the first example.

Another example, s=12, x=6. Split into 6 and 6. Each contributes m(6,6) =1. So m(12,6)=2.

Yes.

So the formula is:

m(s, x) = 1 if s >=x and (s is 1 or splitting s into a and b (as per parity) leads to a and b that can't contribute more parts than 1).

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, this can be viewed as a binary tree where each node represents a split. The leaves are the parts that are >=x and can't be split further (because splitting would result in parts <x). Each split that allows both children to contribute parts increases the count.

But again, for large s, this is not feasible.

Hmm. Let's try to model this in a way that can be computed with O(log s) steps.

Let me think of m(s, x) as follows:

Each time we split s, the maximum number of parts is the sum of the parts from a and b. However, we can split s into a and b only if a >=x and b >=x. Otherwise, splitting s gives a sum that is less than 1 (the original part) plus the sum of the splits. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum number of parts is the largest possible, which is either 1 (taking the whole piece) or the sum from splitting into a and b.

But how to compute this without recursion.

Another idea: For a given s and x, the maximum number of parts is the number of times we can split s into pieces >=x, where each split increases the count of pieces by 1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the process. The initial count is 1. Each split adds 1. But each split must split a piece into two parts >=x. So for example, splitting s into a and b (both >=x) gives 2 pieces. Then splitting each of them into their own a and b gives 4 pieces, etc. So the maximum possible m is 2^d, where d is the number of splits allowed. But this is only true if each split is possible. So for s=12 and x=6, you can split once into two 6's, so m=2. For s=24 and x=6: split into 12 and 12. Each can be split into 6 and 6. So m=4. So yes, it's 2^2=4.

So in this case, the maximum m is 2^d where d is the number of splits. But this depends on the splits being possible. So for s and x, the maximum m is 2^d, where d is the maximum number of splits possible such that after each split, each part is >=x.

But how to compute d?

For example, s=24, x=6: split into 12 and 12 (each >=6). Then split each into 6 and 6. So after two splits, the count is 4. So d=2.

But how to find d for s and x.

Wait, each split halves the size, but only if the split results in parts >=x. So for s and x, the maximum possible d is the number of times you can split s into two parts, each >=x, recursively.

Wait, perhaps d is the maximum number of splits possible such that s / (2^d) >=x. For even splits. But this may not be accurate when splits are into unequal parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of parts is the largest m where m is a power of two and m <= s /x.

But this isn't correct for cases where s is not a power of two. For example, s=9 and x=5. The maximum m is 1. s/x is 1.8, so the largest m is 1.

s=12 and x=6: 12/6=2, which is 2, which is a power of two (2^1). So m=2.

s=24 and x=6: 24/6=4, which is 2^2. So m=4.

s=8 and x=3: 8/3=2.666. The largest m that is a power of two is 2 (2^1). But splitting 8 into 4 and4. Then each 4 is split into 2 and 2. But 2 <3. So the maximum m is 2 (from splitting once into two 4's, each >=3). So m=2, which is 2^1. So the formula holds.

But if s=5, x=2: the maximum m is 2. Split 5 into 3 and 2. Then split 3 into 2 and 1. So m is 2 (3 is split into 2 and 1, but the 1 is not counted. So the 5 is split into 3 and 2: m=2 (3 >=2, 2 >=2). So here, s/x is 2.5. The largest power of two is 2. So formula holds.

But wait, in this case, after splitting 5 into 3 and 2 (both >=2), the 3 can be split into 2 and 1, but the 1 is <2. So the total parts is 3 (3 and 2 from the first split, then splitting 3 gives 2 and 1). But 1 is not counted. So total m=2 (3 and 2) or 3 (if the 2 is split into 2 and 0?) No, because splitting 2 into 1 and 1 is not allowed (since you can't split a 2 into two 1's, but the problem states that you can split any existing part into two equal parts, unless it's 1. So splitting 2 into 1 and 1 is allowed? Wait, no. Because splitting a part of size 2: yes, you can split into two parts of 1 each. But then those parts can't be split further. So for x=2, splitting 2 into 1 and 1: each is 1, which is less than x=2. So m(2,2) is 1 (take the whole). Splitting gives 0 parts. So for s=5 and x=2, the maximum m is 2 (from splitting into 3 and 2). Then splitting 3 into 2 and 1 gives m(3,2) =1 (split into 2 and 1, but 2 >=2: so 1 part). So the total m would be 2 (3 split into 2 parts: 2 and 1. So 2 parts: 3 and 2. Then the 3 splits into 2 and 1, giving 2 (from 3) and 2 (from the original 2). Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum m is the largest power of two that fits into s/x. But in cases where s is split into unequal parts, this may not hold.

But perhaps the correct way to compute m is the maximum number of parts as the largest possible where each split is done into two parts >=x, and each part can be split further.

So for s and x, m is the maximum number of parts possible by splitting s into as many as possible parts >=x, each split step allowing for further splits.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the maximum number of parts is the largest possible m that is a power of two, such that when s is split into m parts via successive splits, each part is >=x.

For example, s=8, x=2: split into 4 and4 (m=2), split each into 2 and 2 (m=4), split each into 1 and 1 (but can't split further. So m=4).

But for x=2, each part of 2 can be split into 1 and1, but since 1 is less than x=2, they can't be used. So the maximum m for s=8 and x=2 is 4.

But according to this approach, the maximum m is the number of splits where each split divides the current parts into two equal parts (if even) or as equal as possible (if odd), until the parts are >=x and splitting would make them <x.

But again, this is not straightforward to compute.

Another approach: For a given s and x, the maximum possible m is the sum of all the possible parts >=x that can be generated from s by splitting it optimally. But how to calculate this.

Let me think of it in terms of the binary representation of s/x.

Alternatively, for a given x, the maximum m for s is:

m(s, x) = 1 if s < 2x. Because splitting s into two parts would result in a and b where at least one of them is <x. So for example, s=5, x=3: splitting gives 3 and 2. 2 is <3, so m(s, x) is 1. But wait, what if s=6 and x=3. Then splitting into 3 and3 gives m=2. Which is 6/3=2. So when s is a multiple of x and is even, then m(s, x) is s/x.

But wait, 6/3=2. So 2 is allowed. So in this case, m(s, x) is s/x.

Another example: s=12, x=3. Then splitting into 6 and6 (each 6 >=3). Then each 6 into 3 and3. So m=4. Which is 12/3 =4. So in this case, m(s, x) is s/x.

So perhaps the maximum m is the largest possible m that is a power of two and <= s/x, but also s can be split into m parts of at least x each.

Wait, but in the case where s=5 and x=2: s/x is 2.5. So the largest m is 2 (split into 3 and 2, both >=2). Which is not a power of two. So this approach would fail.

Hmm. So the previous assumption is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

For each s and x, the maximum m is the maximum number of parts >=x that can be obtained by splitting s into any number of parts (could be any integer), not necessarily a power of two.

But how to compute this.

Let's think of this as a greedy approach. For a given s and x, the maximum m is the largest possible number of parts >=x. To maximize this, we can split s into as many parts as possible. Each split of a part into two parts >=x increases the count.

But the way to split a part s_i into two parts is to split into the smallest possible parts >=x. Wait, no. To maximize the count, perhaps splitting into two parts as equal as possible.

Wait, for example, s=9 and x=5: split into 5 and4. The 5 is a part >=x (count 1). 4 can't be split. So total is 1. If we don't split, it's 1. So maximum is 1.

But for s=10 and x=5: split into 5 and5. So m=2. Which is 10/5=2.

Similarly, s=7 and x=3. Split into 4 and3. 4 >=3, 3 >=3. So m=2. Then split 4 into 2 and2 (both <3). So the total is 2. So maximum is 2.

So for s=7, x=3: m=2.

So s/x is 7/3 ≈ 2.333. The maximum m is 2.

So the formula here is m(s, x) = floor(s/x) if s is divisible by x and the split allows even splits. Otherwise, it's floor(s/x) or something else.

But this is not correct for all cases. For example, s=5 and x=2: floor(5/2)=2. Which is correct (split into 3 and2).

Another example: s=9 and x=5: floor(9/5)=1, which is correct.

s=12 and x=5: floor(12/5)=2. But splitting into 6 and6, each split into 3 and3. But 3 <5. So maximum m is 2 (the 6 and6, which are >=5). So floor(12/5) =2, which matches.

So perhaps the maximum m is floor(s/x).

But wait, s=7 and x=3: floor(7/3)=2, which matches.

s=6 and x=3: floor(6/3)=2. Which matches.

s=8 and x=3: floor(8/3)=2. Splitting into 4 and4. Each is >=3. So m=2. Which matches.

But what about s=11, x=4. floor(11/4)=2. Split into 6 and5. 6 >=4, 5 >=4. So m=2. Which matches. Then, split 6 into 3 and3, but 3 <4. So no further splits. So m remains 2. So floor(11/4) =2. Correct.

Another example: s=7, x=2. floor(7/2) =3. How can we get 3 parts? Let's see:

7 can be split into 4 and3. Then 4 can be split into 2 and2. Each of those is >=2. 3 can be split into 2 and1. So the parts would be 2,2,2,3. But the 3 is >=2. Wait, but the 3 is split into 2 and1. So the initial split of 7 into 4 and3 gives 4 and3. Then 4 split into 2 and2: count is 2. Then 3 split into 2 and1: count is 1. So total parts >=2 is 2 (from 4 splits) + 1 (from 3 split) =3. So m=3. So floor(7/2)=3. Which matches.

So this suggests that m(s, x) = floor(s/x).

But why?

Because when you split s into parts as small as possible (but >=x), you can get up to floor(s/x) parts.

But how does this hold with the previous examples.

Yes, in all the examples I tried, m(s, x) equals floor(s/x).

Wait, but wait: let's take s=5 and x=2. floor(5/2) is 2. Which is correct. But what if s=5 and x=2.5. floor(5/2.5)=2. But x=2.5 is not allowed because the problem states that x is an integer? No, wait, in the problem statement, x is the minimum of the bi's, which is a positive integer. Because each bi is the number of slices a pupil receives, and slices are integers.

Wait, in the problem statement, the slices are integers. So x must be an integer. So when we're performing binary search, x is an integer.

So in this case, m(s, x) is floor(s/x), but how?

But wait, s=5 and x=2: floor(5/2)=2. So how can we split 5 into 3 and 2. Then each is >=2. So two parts, which is 2. So that's correct.

Another example: s=7, x=3. floor(7/3)=2. Which is correct.

So the hypothesis is that for any s and x, m(s, x) is floor(s/x). But why?

Because when you split s into as many parts as possible, each >=x, the maximum is floor(s/x). But how to prove this.

Let's assume that s can be split into m parts, each of which is at least x. Then the sum of those parts is at least m*x. But since the sum of the parts must be exactly s, we have m*x <=s. So m <= s//x.

So the maximum possible m is s//x.

But how to split s into s//x parts each of which is at least x.

If s//x is possible, then m(s, x) = s//x.

But how to split s into s//x parts each of size >=x.

For example, s=7 and x=3. s//x=2. So split into 3 and4. Both >=3. So 2 parts. Which works.

s=9 and x=5. s//x=1. So split into 5 and4. Only 5 is used, 1 part. Which is correct.

s=5 and x=2. s//x=2. Split into 3 and2. Both >=2. So 2 parts.

Yes. So the maximum m is s//x.

But how?

But according to the previous split rules, how can we split s into s//x parts each of size >=x.

Because the split process is allowed to split into any number of parts, not just power of two.

But the problem's splitting rules allow us to split any part (except size 1) into two parts, even if they are not equal. So perhaps the optimal way to get the maximum number of parts is to split the tangerine into as many parts of size x as possible, and one larger part.

Wait, for example, s=7, x=3. Then 7 =3 +4. So two parts. Which is s//x=2.

But according to the splitting rules, we can split 7 into 4 and3. Then 4 can be split into 2 and2 (but they are <3). So the maximum is 2 parts (4 and3).

But why can't we split it into more parts?

Because each split increases the number of parts by 1. So to get m parts, you need m-1 splits.

But for s=7 and x=3, m=2. So 1 split.

But to get 3 parts, you need 2 splits. But after the first split into 4 and3, you can split the 4 into 2 and2, but both are less than x=3. So those parts can't be used. So the maximum is 2.

But according to s//x=7//3=2, which matches.

So perhaps the maximum number of parts is indeed s//x.

But how to reconcile this with the earlier function where splitting into two parts recursively may yield different results.

But according to this, m(s, x) = s//x.

But wait, what about s=6 and x=3. s//x=2. But you can split into two 3's, giving 2 parts. Or split into 3 and3, and then each into 1.5 and1.5, but that's not possible (since slices are integers). So the maximum is 2.

Yes.

Another example: s=12 and x=6. s//x=2. Split into 6 and6: 2 parts. So yes.

So this suggests that the maximum number of parts is s//x.

But how to confirm this for all cases.

Let's think of another example. s=9 and x=5. s//x=1. So we can split into 5 and4. Only one part (5) is >=5. So m=1. Which matches.

Another example: s=11 and x=4. s//x=2. Split into 6 and5. Both >=4. So m=2. Which is correct.

s=12 and x=5. s//x=2. Split into 6 and6. Both >=5. So m=2. Which is correct.

So it seems that m(s, x) = s//x.

So the function m(s, x) is simply s//x.

But wait, how does this align with the splitting rules?

For example, s=7 and x=2. s//x=3. Split into 4 and3. Then split 4 into 2 and2. Now we have 2,2,3. Split 3 into 2 and1. Now we have 2,2,2,1. So three parts >=2. Which is 3. So m=3, which is s//x=3.

Yes.

Another example: s=5 and x=2. s//x=2. Split into 3 and2. Both >=2. So m=2.

Yes.

So this suggests that m(s, x) is s//x.

If this is true, then the problem becomes straightforward. For each tangerine, the maximum number of parts >=x is a_i //x. And the sum of all a_i //x must be >=k. So the binary search problem becomes to find the maximum x such that sum (a_i //x) >=k.

Wait, but this seems to align with the examples.

Let's test the first example:

Input:

3 2

5 9 3

Possible x=5.

sum(5//5 +9//5 +3//5) =1+1+0=2 >=2. So x=5 is possible.

Another example:

2 4

12 14

sum(12//x +14//x) >=4.

For x=6: 12//6=2, 14//6=2. Sum 4 >=4. So x=6 is possible.

Which matches the second example.

Third example:

2 3

1 1

sum(1//x +1//x) >=3. For any x>=1, each term is 1//x which is 1 if x=1. Sum 2 >=3? No. So output is -1.

Which matches the third example.

So this suggests that the correct approach is to perform a binary search on x, where for each x, compute the sum of a_i //x for all a_i, and check if the sum >=k.

If this is the case, then the problem reduces to a standard binary search problem.

But wait, why is this correct? Because according to the splitting rules, we can split a tangerine into exactly m = a_i //x parts, each of size >=x. So the sum of these m_i across all a_i is >=k.

But how to model this with the splitting rules.

Because according to the splitting rules, the way to split a tangerine into m parts is to make m splits, which is possible as long as each split is done according to the rules.

But according to the hypothesis, the maximum number of parts is a_i //x.

But how to model that.

For example, when splitting a tangerine into m parts, each of size >=x, the sum of the parts is a_i. So the minimal sum is m*x. Since a_i >= m*x, we have m <= a_i //x.

But the maximum possible m is a_i //x.

So, the sum of m_i is sum(a_i //x) >=k.

Thus, binary search on x from 1 to max(a_i), and find the maximum x where sum(a_i //x) >=k.

If this sum is >=k, then it's possible to distribute the parts.

So the solution is to binary search x, and for each x, compute sum( a_i //x ). If this sum is >=k, then x is possible. We want to find the maximum x.

This approach is O(n) per binary search step, and the number of steps is log(max a_i).

But with n up to 1e6 and a_i up to 1e7, this would be O(30 * 1e6) = 3e7 operations, which is manageable.

Now, what about the edge cases.

What if sum(a_i) <k *x ? Then sum(a_i //x) will be less than k.

But the binary search will find the maximum x where sum >=k.

So the code would be:

- Check if the sum of all a_i is >=k *1. Because each pupil must get at least 1 slice. So if sum of a_i <k, then output -1.

Otherwise, perform binary search.

But wait, sum(a_i) can be >=k, but sum(a_i//x) can be <k for x=1. Because sum(a_i) can be >=k, but sum(a_i//1) is sum(a_i), which is >=k. So x=1 is always possible.

But how? Because if sum(a_i) >=k, then sum(a_i//1) = sum(a_i) >=k, so x=1 is possible.

So the only case where it's impossible is when sum(a_i) <k.

Because even if you split all a_i into 1 slice each, you need sum(a_i) >=k. Otherwise, it's impossible.

So the first step is to check if sum(a_i) <k: if yes, output -1.

Otherwise, binary search x from 1 to max(a_i), to find the maximum x where sum(a_i//x) >=k.

So this is the approach.

But why does this work? Because the maximum x is the largest x such that the sum of a_i //x is >=k.

Because each a_i can be split into a_i//x parts of size x (if possible), and the sum of these parts is exactly x * sum(a_i//x), which is <= sum(a_i). But for x to be a possible joy, sum(a_i//x) must be >=k. So this approach works.

But how does this model the splitting rules?

Because according to the splitting rules, when splitting a tangerine into a_i//x parts of size x, it may require splitting into parts that are larger than x, but not smaller than x.

But the problem states that the minimum of the parts is x. So the minimum is x, which is our answer.

So this approach correctly computes the maximum possible x.

Thus, the solution is to perform binary search for x, and for each x, compute the sum of a_i //x for all a_i. If sum >=k, then x is possible. We need to find the maximum such x.

So the code steps are:

- Check if sum(a) <k: if yes, output -1.

- Else, perform binary search on x from 1 to max_a (the maximum a_i).

For each mid x:

compute sum( a_i //x for all a_i )

if sum >=k: possible, search higher.

else: search lower.

The maximum x found is the answer.

Now, implement this in Python.

But with n up to 1e6 and a_i up to 1e7, the code must be efficient.

In Python, even 1e6 iterations are manageable.

So let's code this.

Read n and k.

Read the list a.

Compute sum_a = sum(a).

If sum_a <k: print -1.

Else:

Compute max_a = max(a)

Set low =1, high= max_a.

answer=0

while low <=high:

mid = (low +high) //2

current_sum = sum( x//mid for x in a )

if current_sum >=k:

answer=mid

low=mid +1

else:

high=mid -1

print(answer)

But for n=1e6, each binary step is O(n), which with log2(1e7) steps (~24), total operations are 24e6, which is acceptable.

But in Python, this may be too slow for the time constraints. So we need to optimize the code.

The main bottleneck is the sum( x//mid for x in a ). For 1e6 elements, each division is O(1), but in Python, list comprehensions are faster than loops.

But even so, for 1e6 elements, each step is O(1e6), which for 24 steps is 24e6 operations—manageable.

Third sample:

n=2, k=3.

sum is 2<3 → output -1. Correct.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

But what about when a_i has elements that are 1?

For example, a=[1,1], k=2. sum is 2 >=2. sum(1//1 +1//1) =2 >=2 → x=1 is possible. So answer is1.

But if k=3, sum is 2 <3 → output -1.

Thus, the code handles this.

Thus, the code is correct.
