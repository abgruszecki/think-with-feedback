<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if a given string is an s-palindrome. The definition says it's symmetric about the middle. Hmm. Let's see the examples to get a better idea.

In the first example, "oXoxoXo" outputs TAK. Let's see why. Maybe each character's position mirrors around the center. Wait, what's the middle here? For a string of length 7, the middle is the 4th character (index 3 if 0-based). Then, each pair of characters equidistant from the middle should mirror each other. Wait, but how exactly?

The problem statement says that the string is symmetric about the middle. So for even lengths, like "aa", which isn't a s-palindrome. Oh right, in the example, "aa" is not s-palindrome because the second half isn't a mirror of the first. So maybe each pair of characters around the center must mirror each other in a certain way.

Wait, the example given where "oHo" is s-palindrome. Let's see. The middle is 'H'. Then the first 'o' and the last 'o' must mirror. So perhaps each character and its symmetric counterpart around the middle should be mirror images of each other. But what's considered a mirror here?

Ah, the problem mentions the English alphabet. So I think there's a specific set of mirrored characters. For example, certain letters have symmetric counterparts. Like 'b' and 'd' might not be mirrors unless specified. Wait, the problem says "mirror reflection". So perhaps each character has a mirror counterpart. Let's think about which letters are symmetric.

Wait, the example with "bod" outputs TAK. Let's look at that. The string is length 3. Middle is 'o'. The first character is 'b', the last is 'd'. So 'b' and 'd' are mirrors of each other? If that's the case, then maybe certain pairs are considered mirrors. Like 'b' and 'd' are mirrors, 'p' and 'q' are mirrors. Also, letters that are symmetric themselves like 'A', 'H', 'I', 'M', 'O', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y' would be their own mirrors.

So the key here is to check for each pair (i and len(s)-1 -i) whether each character is the mirror of the other. For even-length strings, each pair must mirror. For odd-length, the middle character must mirror itself.

So the first step is to figure out what the mirror pairs are. Let's think of all possible mirrored characters.

Let's list all pairs that are mirrors of each other. The problem's example includes "oXoxoXo" being valid. Let's see: the first character is 'o', the last is 'o' — which is a mirror of itself. Then the second is 'X', next to last is 'o' — wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait, let's look at the first example input: "oXoxoXo". The output is TAK. Let's split the string into the first half and the second half. The length is 7, so the middle is index 3 (character 'x'). The pairs are:

Indices 0 and 6: 'o' and 'o' — which is a mirror pair if 'o' mirrors itself.

Indices 1 and 5: 'X' and 'X' — same, so mirrors.

Indices 2 and 4: 'o' and 'o' — same.

Middle index 3: 'x' must mirror itself.

So in this case, all pairs are mirrors. So the approach is to check for each pair (i, len(s)-1 -i) whether the two characters are mirrors of each other. For even-length strings, all such pairs must mirror. For odd-length, the middle character must mirror itself.

But then how do we know which characters are mirrors of each other?

The problem statement says "mirror reflection". So perhaps the mirroring is such that each character is mapped to another. For example:

Letters like 'b' and 'd' are mirrors, 'p' and 'q' are mirrors. Also, letters that are symmetric (like 'A', 'H', etc.) mirror themselves.

So we need to create a dictionary that maps each character to its mirror counterpart.

So the first step is to define all such pairs. Let's list them:

Mirror pairs:

- b <-> d
- p <-> q
- s <-> s? No, wait, maybe 's' is not symmetric. Wait, but which letters are symmetric?

Letters that are symmetric (same when mirrored) are:

A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y. Also, maybe lowercase letters like 'o', 'x', etc.?

Wait, the problem says the string consists of English letters. But it doesn't specify uppercase or lowercase. Wait, the examples given are a mix. For example, the first input is "oXoxoXo" — which has lowercase 'o' and uppercase 'X'.

Ah, but the problem says "English letters" but the examples have mixed cases. So case matters. So, for example, 'b' and 'd' are mirrors only if they are in their respective cases. Or maybe case is ignored? But the examples have 'X' and 'o' which are different cases but are considered mirrors. Wait in the first example, the second character is 'X', and the fifth is 'X' (since the input is oXoxoXo. Let me check:

Input is o X o x o X o. So indices 0: o, 1: X, 2: o, 3: x, 4: o, 5: X, 6: o. So pair 1 and 5 are both 'X', which mirror themselves. So that's why they are valid. So the case matters. So 'X' and 'x' would not be mirrors unless they are considered as such.

Wait, but in the example, the third character is 'x' (lowercase), and the middle character is 'x'. Since it's the middle, it must mirror itself. So 'x' must be considered a symmetric character. But maybe the mirror mapping is case-sensitive. So, for example, 'X' mirrors 'X', and 'x' mirrors 'x'.

So first, let's create a dictionary that maps each character to its mirror counterpart.

So here's the approach:

Create a dictionary where each key is a character, and the value is the mirror character.

The symmetric characters (those that mirror themselves) are:

A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y for uppercase.

Similarly, for lowercase: a, h, i, m, o, t, u, v, w, x, y.

Additionally, the pairs (b, d), (d, b), (p, q), (q, p) for both lowercase and uppercase. Wait, but uppercase 'B' mirrors 'D'? So 'B' -> 'D', 'D'-> 'B', and same for 'P' and 'Q'.

So the mapping would be:

For uppercase:

B <-> D

P <-> Q

For lowercase:

b <-> d

p <-> q

The other letters are mirrored only if they are symmetric.

So, for each character in the string, when paired with its mirror position counterpart (i and len(s)-1 -i), they must be each other's mirror.

So, for example, in the first example, each pair is:

o (which is a lowercase o) and o. Since o is symmetric, so it's allowed.

X (uppercase X) and X. X is symmetric, so allowed.

Similarly for other pairs.

Another example is "bod". The string is 'b', 'o', 'd'. The pairs are 0 and 2. 'b' and 'd' should mirror each other. So 'b' should map to 'd' and 'd' to 'b' (lowercase), which is the case. So the pair (b, d) is valid. Then 'o' is symmetric. So the string is s-palindrome.

In the third example, "ER": the pairs are 0 and 1. 'E' and 'R'. 'E' does not mirror 'R', so it's invalid.

So the plan is:

1. Create a mirror map that contains all the required pairs.

2. For each pair in the string (i from 0 to len(s)//2 - 1), check if s[i] and s[mirror_index] are mirrors. Also, if the length is odd, the middle character must be a symmetric one.

3. If all pairs satisfy the mirror condition, return TAK; else, NIE.

So first, build the mirror map.

Let's define the mirror map:

mirror = {
    # Uppercase
    'A': 'A',
    'H': 'H',
    'I': 'I',
    'M': 'M',
    'O': 'O',
    'T': 'T',
    'U': 'U',
    'V': 'V',
    'W': 'W',
    'X': 'X',
    'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D',
    'D': 'B',
    'P': 'Q',
    'Q': 'P',
    # Lowercase
    'a': 'a',
    'h': 'h',
    'i': 'i',
    'm': 'm',
    'o': 'o',
    't': 't',
    'u': 'u',
    'v': 'v',
    'w': 'w',
    'x': 'x',
    'y': 'y',
    'b': 'd',
    'd': 'b',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'p',
}

Any character not in this map cannot be part of an s-palindrome. For example, 'E' is not in the map, so if a character is 'E', it's only allowed if its mirror is also 'E', but since 'E' is not in the map, that's invalid.

Wait, but what about other characters like 'S' or 'Z'? They are not in the map, so if the string includes such characters, their pairs must also not be in the map. So, for example, if a pair is 'S' and 'S', but since 'S' is not in the mirror map, this would return false.

Wait, no. The mirror map includes only the characters that have a valid mirror. So any character not in the mirror map cannot be part of a valid s-palindrome. Because, if a character is not present in the mirror map, then when we check, we can immediately return false.

Wait, no. Because the mirror map should have all characters that have a valid mirror. So, for any character in the string, if it is not in the mirror map, then it can't have a mirror. So if a character in the string is not present in the mirror map, the entire string is invalid.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Let's think: For example, 'C' is not in the mirror map. So if a pair is 'C' and 'C', since there's no entry in the mirror map, then we can't consider them as mirrors. Because according to the problem statement, the string is s-palindrome only if each pair is mirrored. So if a character is not in the mirror map, then it's impossible for it to form a valid pair.

So for example, if the string is "CC", then each character is 'C'. But since 'C' is not in the mirror map, when we look up mirror.get('C', None), we get None. So the pair (C, C) would not be valid, leading to output NIE.

Thus, the approach is:

For each i from 0 to (n-1)//2:

- Get the left character s[i] and right character s[n-1 -i].

- Check if left is in the mirror map. If not, invalid.

- Check if right is in the mirror map. If not, invalid.

- Check if mirror[left] == right. If not, invalid.

If all pairs pass, then the string is s-palindrome.

Additionally, for the middle character in odd-length strings, it must mirror itself (so the middle character must be in the mirror map and mirror[middle] is middle).

So, implementing this:

We can create the mirror dictionary as described.

Then, iterate over each pair. For each pair (i, mirror_i):

- Check if s[i] exists in mirror, and s[mirror_i] exists in mirror.

- Check that mirror[s[i]] == s[mirror_i].

If all these are true, then return TAK else NIE.

So the steps are:

1. Create the mirror dictionary.

2. Check for each i in 0 to (n//2 -1) inclusive:

   a. Get mirror_i = len(s)-1 -i.

   b. Check if s[i] and s[mirror_i] are present in the mirror.

   c. Check that mirror[s[i]] == s[mirror_i].

3. If all pairs pass, then return TAK else NIE.

So now, code steps:

Read the input string.

Loop through each index up to the middle.

Check each pair.

Now, let's code this.

But first, create the mirror dictionary.

Let's create it as a Python dictionary.

mirror = {
    'A':'A', 'H':'H', 'I':'I', 'M':'M', 'O':'O', 'T':'T', 'U':'U', 'V':'V', 'W':'W', 'X':'X', 'Y':'Y',
    'B':'D', 'D':'B', 'P':'Q', 'Q':'P',
    'a':'a', 'h':'h', 'i':'i', 'm':'m', 'o':'o', 't':'t', 'u':'u', 'v':'v', 'w':'w', 'x':'x', 'y':'y',
    'b':'d', 'd':'b', 'p':'q', 'q':'p'
}

Wait, but what about 'S'? 'S' in uppercase would not be in the dictionary, so any occurrence would make it invalid.

Now, code:

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)

for i in range((n+1)//2): # Wait, because for n=3, the loop runs for i=0 and 1? Wait, no. Wait, when n is 3, indices 0 and 2. So for i in 0 to (n-1)//2. Because (n-1)//2 for 3 is (2)//2=1. So range((n)//2) would be 0 and 1. Wait, perhaps the loop should run from 0 to (n//2) -1. For even n=4: 0 and 1. For n=3: (3//2) is 1, so loop runs 0 and 1? No, because for n=3, the middle is index 1. The pairs are (0, 2). So the loop needs to run once, i=0. So for i in 0 to (n//2) -1. Wait, n//2 for 3 is 1, so (n//2) -1 is 0. So the loop runs from i=0 to 0. So that's correct.

So for i in range(n//2):

    left = s[i]
    right = s[n-1 -i]

    if left not in mirror or right not in mirror:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

    if mirror[left] != right:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

If the loop completes, then check if the middle character exists (for odd n):

if n % 2 == 1:

    middle = s[n//2]

    if middle not in mirror or mirror[middle] != middle:

        print("NIE")

        exit()

Else:

print("TAK")

Wait, but wait. For even n, all pairs are checked, but for odd n, after checking all pairs, check the middle character.

Yes.

So, code:

s = input().strip()

mirror = {
    'A':'A', 'H':'H', 'I':'I', 'M':'M', 'O':'O', 'T':'T', 'U':'U', 'V':'V', 'W':'W', 'X':'X', 'Y':'Y',
    'B':'D', 'D':'B', 'P':'Q', 'Q':'P',
    'a':'a', 'h':'h', 'i':'i', 'm':'m', 'o':'o', 't':'t', 'u':'u', 'v':'v', 'w':'w', 'x':'x', 'y':'y',
    'b':'d', 'd':'b', 'p':'q', 'q':'p'
}

n = len(s)

for i in range(n//2):
    left = s[i]
    right = s[n-1 -i]

    # Check if left exists in mirror and right exists in mirror
    if left not in mirror or right not in mirror:
        print("NIE")
        exit()
    if mirror[left] != right:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

# Check middle character if odd length
if n % 2 == 1:
    mid_char = s[n//2]
    if mid_char not in mirror or mirror[mid_char] != mid_char:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

print("TAK")

Testing this code against the examples:

First example:

Input: oXoxoXo

Wait, the input is "oXoxoXo". Let's see:

The length is 7. So n//2 = 3. So loop runs 0 to 2 (i=0,1,2).

i=0: left='o', right='o'. 'o' is in mirror (mirror['o'] is 'o'), so mirror[left] is 'o', which matches right. OK.

i=1: left='X', right='X'. mirror['X'] is 'X', so OK.

i=2: left='o', right='o'. OK.

Then check the middle character (index 3) is 'x'. mirror['x'] is 'x'. So condition is met.

Output is TAK.

Second example: "bod" (length 3).

i ranges up to 1 (n//2 is 1, so loop runs i=0).

i=0: left 'b', right 'd'. mirror['b'] is 'd', which equals right. So OK.

Then check the middle character (index 1) is 'o'. mirror['o'] is 'o', so OK. Output TAK.

Third example: "ER" (length 2).

i ranges 0. left 'E', right 'R'. 'E' not in mirror. So code checks left not in mirror, prints NIE.

Which is correct.

Another test case: 'aa' (output NIE). Because for the two 'a's. 'a' is in mirror (mirror['a'] is 'a'). So left and right are both 'a's. So code would check mirror['a'] == 'a', which is true. But according to the problem statement, 'aa' is not s-palindrome. Wait, but according to the problem statement, in the first example, 'aa' is not s-palindrome. Wait the problem says:

"For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half."

Wait, according to the code, 'aa' would pass. But according to the problem statement, it's not. So why?

Ah, here's the problem. Because 'aa' is of even length. The first half is 'a', the second is 'a'. But according to the code, each pair (0, 1) would have 'a' and 'a'. 'a' is in the mirror map and mirrors itself. So code would output TAK. But according to the problem statement, the answer should be NIE.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in our understanding of the problem.

Wait, the problem says that the string "aa" is not s-palindrome. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem's definition says that the string is s-palindrome if it is symmetric about the middle. The example says that "aa" is not s-palindrome because the second half is not a mirror reflection of the first.

But according to our mirror map, 'a' is a symmetric character. So why is 'aa' not considered s-palindrome?

Ah, perhaps I've made a mistake in the mirror map. Because according to the problem statement, perhaps the 'a' is not a symmetric character. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the symmetric letters.

Wait, maybe the symmetric letters are only uppercase letters. Let's check the examples again.

In the first example, "oXoxoXo", which has lowercase 'o's and uppercase 'X's, which are considered symmetric.

But according to the problem statement's first example, the output is TAK. So the code's mirror map is correct.

But according to the problem statement, "aa" is not s-palindrome. But according to the code, 'a' is in the mirror map and mirrors itself. So the code would output TAK for "aa".

This is a contradiction. So why is the problem's example saying that "aa" is not s-palindrome?

Hmm. So there's a mistake in our understanding of the mirror mappings.

Wait, perhaps the problem's definition of "mirror reflection" is that each character in the first half is the mirror of the corresponding character in the second half. But perhaps the 'a' is not a mirror of itself. So maybe the mirror mappings are different.

Wait, the problem's example of "aa" not being s-palindrom suggests that 'a' is not a mirror of itself. But according to our mirror map, 'a' is a mirror.

So where is the mistake here?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's example is wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps our mirror map is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror reflection is not the same as being symmetric. Maybe the mirror reflection of a character is different. For example, perhaps 'a's mirror is 'a' when flipped horizontally. But maybe in reality, 'a' is not symmetric when mirrored. So perhaps the list of symmetric characters is different.

Ah, this is the crux. If the code is incorrect for the "aa" case, then the mirror mappings must be wrong.

But according to the problem statement, the example "bod" is correct. 'b' and 'd' are mirrors, 'o' is symmetric.

So the problem is that the code would return TAK for "aa", but according to the problem statement, it should return NIE.

So our mirror map is incorrect. So why?

Ah! Oh right. The problem statement's example for 'oXoxoXo' is outputting TAK, but according to the code, that's correct. However, the 'a' in the problem's example is not in the mirror map. Wait, no. 'a' is in the mirror map. So according to the code, the string "aa" would output TAK, but according to the problem statement, it's NIE.

So this is a contradiction. Therefore, our mirror map is wrong.

So, why is "aa" considered not s-palindrom? Because according to the problem statement, the second half is not a mirror reflection of the first. So for even-length strings, each character in the first half must be the mirror of the corresponding character in the second half.

But in the case of "aa", each 'a' in the first half is mirrored to 'a', so according to our code, it would pass. But according to the problem statement, it's not. So there must be a mistake in the mirror mappings.

So perhaps 'a' is not a symmetric character. So the mirror map for 'a' is not present, or 'a' is not in the mirror map.

But in our mirror map, 'a' is present and mirrors to itself.

This suggests that the mirror mappings in the code are incorrect. So what's the correct list of mirrored characters?

Let me re-examine the problem statement's examples.

Problem statement examples:

Example 1: Input is "oXoxoXo", output TAK. Let's see the pairs:

Indices 0 and 6: 'o' and 'o' → 'o' is in mirror (mirrors to 'o').

Indices 1 and 5: 'X' and 'X' → 'X' mirrors to 'X'.

Indices 2 and 4: 'o' and 'o' → same.

Middle is 'x' → mirrors to itself.

So code correctly returns TAK.

Example 2: "bod" → output TAK. Code correctly returns TAK.

Example 3: "ER" → output NIE. Correct.

But according to code, "aa" would return TAK. But according to the problem statement, "aa" is not s-palindrome.

So, the code is incorrect. Therefore, the mirror map must not include 'a' as a symmetric character. So 'a' is not in the mirror map.

So where's the mistake in the mirror mappings?

Ah! I think I made a mistake here. The problem statement's example of "aa" is not considered s-palindrome. So in the mirror map, 'a' is not present. So 'a' is not a symmetric character, and thus, the code would return NIE for "aa".

So the problem is that in our current mirror map, 'a' is included as a symmetric character, but according to the problem statement, 'aa' is invalid, which implies that 'a' is not a symmetric character.

So why? The problem statement's first example is "oXoxoXo", which has lowercase 'o's and uppercase 'X's. So 'o' is considered a symmetric character.

But in the example of "aa", the code would return TAK. But according to the problem statement, "aa" is not s-palindrome, so the code would be wrong.

So the mistake is that 'a' is not a symmetric character. Therefore, in the mirror map, 'a' is not present. But then in the code, "aa" would have 'a' not in the mirror map, leading to output NIE.

So what's the correct list of symmetric characters?

I think the problem's mirror pairs are different. Let's re-express the mirror mappings.

According to the problem's examples, "oXoxoXo" is valid, which includes 'o' (lowercase) and 'X' (uppercase) as symmetric.

So 'o' and 'X' are symmetric.

But what about other letters?

The problem's first example's string is "oXoxoXo". Let's split it into pairs:

Indices 0 and 6: 'o' and 'o' → must be mirrors. So 'o' is symmetric.

Indices 1 and 5: 'X' and 'X' → symmetric.

Indices 2 and 4: 'o' and 'o' → symmetric.

Middle character is 'x' → must be symmetric.

So 'x' (lowercase) is symmetric.

But according to the problem statement's example of "aa" being invalid, 'a' is not symmetric.

So the correct mirror mappings are:

Symmetric characters (mirror themselves):

Uppercase: A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y.

Lowercase: o, x, v, w, etc.?

Wait, but the problem statement's example includes 'o' (lowercase) and 'x' (lowercase) as symmetric.

So the mirror map should include lowercase 'o', 'x', and others.

But what about 'a'? 'a' is not in the mirror map.

So in the code, the mirror map for 'a' should not be present.

So the code's current mirror map includes 'a' as a symmetric character, which is incorrect.

So that's the mistake.

So the correct mirror map is:

mirror = {
    'A': 'A', 'H': 'H', 'I': 'I', 'M': 'M', 'O': 'O', 'T': 'T', 'U': 'U', 'V': 'V', 'W': 'W', 'X': 'X', 'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D', 'D': 'B', 'P': 'Q', 'Q': 'P',
    'o': 'o', 'x': 'x', 'v': 'v', 'w': 'w', 's': 's'... wait, but which lowercase letters are symmetric?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers lowercase letters like 'o', 'x', 'v', 'w', 'm', 'u' as symmetric, and others are not.

But how to find the correct list?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's mirror mappings are case-insensitive. Or perhaps the mirror is based on the characters' visual symmetry when reflected around a vertical axis.

For example:

The letters that are vertically symmetric (like when looking in a mirror) are:

Uppercase letters: A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y.

Lowercase letters: some may be symmetric, like 'o', 'x', but 'b' is not.

So 'o' lowercase is symmetric. 'x' is symmetric. 'v' is symmetric. 'w' is symmetric. 'm' is symmetric. 'u' is symmetric.

But 'a' lowercase is not symmetric. For example, when you mirror 'a' horizontally, it becomes a different shape.

So in the problem, the mirror for lowercase 'a' is not 'a', so it's not in the mirror map.

So in the code, 'a' is not in the mirror map. So when the input is 'aa', 'a' is not in the mirror map, so the code outputs NIE.

Thus, the code's mirror map should not include 'a' as a symmetric character.

So the error in the previous code is that 'a' was included in the mirror map. Let's correct that.

So the correct mirror map is:

mirror = {
    # Uppercase
    'A': 'A',
    'H': 'H',
    'I': 'I',
    'M': 'M',
    'O': 'O',
    'T': 'T',
    'U': 'U',
    'V': 'V',
    'W': 'W',
    'X': 'X',
    'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D',
    'D': 'B',
    'P': 'Q',
    'Q': 'P',
    # Lowercase
    'o': 'o',
    'x': 'x',
    'v': 'v',
    'w': 'w',
    'm': 'm',
    'u': 'u',
    't': 't',
    'i': 'i',
    'h': 'h',
    # Also, check for lowercase 's'? No, probably not.
    # Also, lowercase 'b' and 'd' are mirrors.
    'b': 'd',
    'd': 'b',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'p',
}

Wait, but what about lowercase 's'? Not sure. But according to the problem's examples, 'o' and 'x' are allowed.

So in the code, the mirror map for lowercase letters includes:

o, x, v, w, m, u, t, i, h, and also the pairs b/d, p/q.

But the code's previous mirror map included 'a', which is wrong.

So the corrected mirror map should not include 'a' and 's' lowercase.

So let's rebuild the mirror map correctly.

Thus, the code's mirror map should be:

mirror = {
    'A': 'A', 'H': 'H', 'I': 'I', 'M': 'M', 'O': 'O', 'T': 'T', 'U': 'U', 'V': 'V', 'W': 'W', 'X': 'X', 'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D', 'D': 'B', 'P': 'Q', 'Q': 'P',
    # Lowercase
    'o': 'o',
    'x': 'x',
    'v': 'v',
    'w': 'w',
    'm': 'm',
    'u': 'u',
    't': 't',
    'i': 'i',
    'h': 'h',
    'b': 'd',
    'd': 'b',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'p',
    's': 's', # Wait, no. 's' is not symmetric. So no.
}

Wait, but according to the problem's example, the string "bod" is valid. Let's see:

bod has pairs (b, d). In lowercase, 'b' maps to 'd', and 'd' maps to 'b', so this is correct.

Middle character is 'o' lowercase, which is in the mirror map and mirrors to itself.

So the code will return TAK, which is correct.

Now, for the case of "aa" (input):

First character is 'a' lowercase. 'a' is not in the mirror map, so the code checks left not in mirror, returns NIE. Which aligns with the problem's example.

So the code now should handle this case correctly.

Another test case: "oo" (lowercase o). Both are in mirror map and mirror to each other. So code returns TAK.

Another case: "ab", which is 'a' and 'b'. 'a' not in mirror map → returns NIE.

Thus, the code's mirror map was incorrect because it included 'a' and other lowercase letters that are not actually symmetric.

So the correct mirror map is as follows:

mirror = {
    'A': 'A',
    'H': 'H',
    'I': 'I',
    'M': 'M',
    'O': 'O',
    'T': 'T',
    'U': 'U',
    'V': 'V',
    'W': 'W',
    'X': 'X',
    'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D',
    'D': 'B',
    'P': 'Q',
    'Q': 'P',
    'o': 'o',
    'x': 'x',
    'v': 'v',
    'w': 'w',
    'm': 'm',
    'u': 'u',
    't': 't',
    'i': 'i',
    'h': 'h',
    'b': 'd',
    'd': 'b',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'p',
}

Now, let's re-code this.

With this mirror map, the code should work correctly.

Thus, the code should now correctly handle the "aa" case, outputting NIE.

Now, the code is correct.

```python
s = input().strip()
mirror = {
    'A': 'A', 'H': 'H', 'I': 'I', 'M': 'M', 'O': 'O', 'T': 'T', 'U': 'U', 'V': 'V', 'W': 'W', 'X': 'X', 'Y': 'Y',
    'B': 'D', 'D': 'B', 'P': 'Q', 'Q': 'P',
    'o': 'o', 'x': 'x', 'v': 'v', 'w': 'w', 'm': 'm', 'u': 'u', 't': 't', 'i': 'i', 'h': 'h',
    'b': 'd', 'd': 'b', 'p': 'q', 'q': 'p'
}
n = len(s)

for i in range(n // 2):
    left = s[i]
    right = s[n - 1 - i]
    if left not in mirror or mirror[left] != right:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

if n % 2 == 1:
    mid = s[n // 2]
    if mid not in mirror or mirror[mid] != mid:
        print("NIE")
        exit()

print("TAK")
```
