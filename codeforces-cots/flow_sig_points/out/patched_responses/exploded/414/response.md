Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Sam has to find the number of 1s in a certain range after expanding the number n into a list of 0s and 1s through some operations. Let's see. 

The process starts with a list containing just n. Then, each time an element x (greater than 1) is replaced by floor(x/2), x mod 2, floor(x/2). This repeats until all elements are 0 or 1. The task is to find how many 1s are in positions l to r (inclusive) in the final list.

Hmm. Let's think about how the list evolves. Each time a number greater than 1 is split into three parts. For example, 7 becomes 3,1,3. Then each 3 splits into 1,1,1. Wait, but the example says that after splitting 7 once, you get [3,1,3], then next step they split into [1,1,1, 1, 1,1,1] but wait, how?

Wait, maybe each step processes all elements in the current list. So in each step, all elements are checked. If any element is greater than 1, it is replaced by the three parts. But the splitting is done in a breadth-first manner? Or depth-first?

Wait, the problem says "in each operation Sam must remove any element x, such that x >1, from the list and insert at the same position floor(x/2), x mod 2, floor(x/2) sequentially." So the process continues until all elements are 0 or 1. So each operation splits one element. But no, that's not possible because the problem says Sam must perform these operations until all elements are 0 or 1. Wait, maybe the splitting is done for all elements in the current list in each step. But the example shows that 7 is split once into [3,1,3], then in the next step, the two 3s are split. So perhaps, all elements are processed in each step. But how?

Wait, the example given:

7 → [3,1,3] → [1,1,1,1,3] → [1,1,1,1,1,1] → etc. Wait, but the second step splits the two 3s. How?

Wait, the first step is splitting 7 into [3,1,3]. Then, in the next operation, any element x>1 is removed. So the two 3s are in the list. So each 3 is split into 1,1,1. So replacing each 3 with [1,1,1]. So after splitting the first 3, the list becomes [1,1,1,1,3]. Then, split the next 3? Or does the operation process all elements in a single step?

Ah, here's the key: each operation splits all elements greater than 1 in the list. So perhaps each step replaces all x>1 in the list with their three parts. But according to the note in the example, after the first split (7 becomes 3,1,3), the next step splits both 3s. But how? If the process is done in layers. So maybe each level splits all possible elements at once. But in the example, after splitting 3 into 1,1,1, the list would be [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but the example shows that after splitting, the list becomes [1,1,1,1,3], which suggests that maybe they split elements one at a time, not all at once.

Wait, the example's note shows:

7 → [3,1,3] → [1,1,1,1,3] → [1,1,1,1,1,1] → ... 

Wait, the first step splits 7 into three elements. Then the next step splits the first 3 into 1,1,1. So the list becomes [1,1,1,1,3]. Then the next step splits the remaining 3 into 1,1,1, making the list [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. But the example's note shows that after splitting the first 3, the next step seems to split the next 3, but the list in the next step is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but the note says after that step, the list is [1,1,1,1,1,1], which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the note's explanation is a bit abbreviated. Maybe the process is that each time an element is split, the process continues until all elements are 0 or 1. So the splitting is done in a way that processes each element in a depth-first manner, but the order in which elements are split affects the structure of the list. 

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting order doesn't affect the final list's structure. Because when you split elements, their positions are replaced by three parts. So the final list structure depends only on the original elements and the order of splitting doesn't matter. For example, splitting the left 3 first or the right 3 first in the list [3,1,3] would result in the same structure once both are split.

So perhaps the order of splitting doesn't matter, and the final list can be represented as a binary tree structure. Wait, each split creates a left and right part (floor(x/2)), with the middle part being x mod 2. So each element x is represented as a tree where the root is x mod 2, and the left and right children are the splits. But how does this structure translate into the list?

Wait, the process of splitting x into a, b, c (a = x//2, b = x%2, c = x//2) when x>1. Then, each a and c are split similarly. So the structure of the list after splitting all elements can be thought of as the in-order traversal of a binary tree where each node x has left and right children a and c (since the middle element is the node's value mod 2). Wait, no. Wait, each split replaces x with a, b, c. So the original position is replaced by three elements. So the in-order traversal of a binary tree where each node has three children? Or perhaps each split creates a left subtree, a middle node, and a right subtree. So the structure is similar to a ternary expansion. 

Alternatively, the process of splitting x into a, b, c (a, c are x//2, and b is x%2) can be modeled recursively. For example, the final list for x is the concatenation of the list for a, then [b], then the list for c. Because each time x is split, it's replaced by a, b, c. So recursively, a and c are split in the same way until they are 0 or 1. So the structure is built recursively. So the final list is equivalent to the in-order traversal of a binary tree where each node's left is a, right is c, and the node's value is b. 

So the problem reduces to modeling this recursive structure. Then, given a position in the final list (like l to r), how many 1s are present in that range. 

But how can we model this without generating the entire list (since n can be up to 2^50, leading to a very large list)? 

The key insight is that the list has a recursive structure, and each number x can be represented as a binary expansion. For example, when x is split, the middle element is x mod 2. The left and right parts are x//2. Then, each of those parts is split in the same way. So the final list is essentially the binary representation of x, but flattened in a way that includes all the splits. 

Wait, perhaps each x can be viewed as generating a certain pattern of 0s and 1s. The middle element is the least significant bit (LSB) of x. The left and right parts are the higher bits. So for example, 7 in binary is 111. When split, 7 becomes 3, 1, 3. Then each 3 is split into 1,1,1. So the final list is [1,1,1, 1, 1,1,1]. So the count of 1s is 7. 

But how does the position in the list correspond to the binary digits? Let's think of the list for x as follows:

The list for x is formed by concatenating the list for x//2 (left part), then [x%2], then the list for x//2 (right part). This is a recursive structure. 

So the length of the list for x can be determined recursively. Let's denote len(x) as the length of the list for x. Then:

len(x) = 1 if x <=1
Otherwise, len(x) = 2 * len(x//2) + 1 

So for example, len(7) is 2*len(3) +1. len(3) is 2*len(1) +1 = 3. So len(7) = 2*3 +1 =7. Which matches the first example.

So the length can be computed recursively, but for large x (like 2^50), this could be expensive. However, perhaps we can memoize the len(x) function, but given that n can be up to 2^50, but the function is computed as 2* len(x//2) +1, which is similar to the number of bits. Wait, len(x) is 2^k -1, where k is the number of times you can split x until you reach 0 or 1. For example, x=7:

7 is split into 3,1,3. Then each 3 is split into 1,1,1. So len(3)=3, so len(7)=2*3 +1=7. Then each 1 doesn't split. So len(7) is 7. So the number of bits in binary is 3 (7 is 111), but len(7)=7= 2^3 -1=7. So perhaps len(x) is equal to 2^m -1, where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x, but only if x is a power of two minus one. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 10 in the second example: len(10) is 2* len(5) +1. len(5) is 2* len(2)+1. len(2) is 2* len(1) +1=3. So len(5) is 2*3 +1=7. len(10) is 2*7 +1=15. But the example's output for n=10 is a list of length 13. Wait, the input's second example says 10 is split into a list of length 13. Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong. Let's check the example:

Second example input: n=10, l=3, r=10. The output is 5. The note says the final list is [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], which has length 13. But according to the len(10) calculation, len(10) is 2*len(5) +1. len(5)=2* len(2) +1. len(2) is 3. So len(5)=2*3+1=7. len(10)=2*7+1=15. But the example shows len 13. So there's a mistake in my reasoning. 

Wait, perhaps the len function is not calculated as I thought. Let me re-examine the process. 

For x=10: the first split is 10 → [5,0,5]. Then each 5 is split. So for each 5, split into 2,1,2. So the list becomes [2,1,2,0,2,1,2]. Then split each 2 into 1,0,1. So the list becomes [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. Wait, but the example's note shows the final list as [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1], which is length 13. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the splits. Let's step through the example for x=10.

Original list: [10]. Split 10 into 5,0,5. Now the list is [5,0,5]. Split each 5. Each 5 is split into 2,1,2. So the list becomes [2,1,2,0,2,1,2]. Now split the 2s. Each 2 is split into 1,0,1. So after splitting all 2s, the list becomes [1,0,1, 1, 1,0,1, 0, 1,0,1, 1, 1,0,1]. The list's length is 15. But the example's note says the final list for n=10 is of length 13. Wait, this contradicts. So there's something wrong here. 

Wait, the example's note says:

For the second example:

[10] → [5,0,5] → [2,1,2,0,5] → ... ?

Wait, perhaps the splitting is not done for all elements in each step. Maybe the splitting is done one element at a time. For example, in the first step, split 10 into 5,0,5. Then, in the next step, the first 5 is split into 2,1,2. So the list becomes [2,1,2,0,5]. Then the next element is 5 (position 5?), which is split into 2,1,2. So the list becomes [2,1,2,0,2,1,2]. Then, split the 2s. So perhaps each step only splits one element. 

But this would complicate the order in which elements are split. So the final list depends on the order of splitting. But according to the problem statement, Sam can split any element x>1. So the order can vary, but the final list after all splits must have all elements 0 or 1, and the positions of 1s and 0s would be the same regardless of the splitting order. 

Wait, that's an important point. The problem statement says that the final list must be such that all elements are 0 or 1. So regardless of the order in which elements are split, the final list structure is the same. Because each split is deterministic. For example, splitting x into a, b, c where a and c are x//2, and b is x%2. So the splitting process is deterministic, and the order doesn't affect the final list's structure. So the final list is unique for a given initial n. 

So the recursive structure is correct. Therefore, the example's note must have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating len(10). Let's re-examine the example's note for n=10. The note says the final list after splitting 10 is [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], which has length 13. According to the recursive len(x) function:

len(10) = 2*len(5) +1. 

len(5) = 2*len(2)+1.

len(2) = 2*len(1)+1 = 2*1 +1=3.

So len(5) = 2*3+1=7. len(10) = 2*7+1=15. But the example's list is length 13. So this suggests that my len(x) formula is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement's note. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the splitting process.

Wait, let's look at the example in the problem note for n=10. The note says that the final list is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. Let's count the elements: that's 13 elements. But according to the recursive len formula, len(10) should be 15. So there's a contradiction here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting stops once the elements are 0 or 1. Let's reevaluate.

For x=10:

Original: [10].

Split 10 into 5,0,5. Now list is [5,0,5].

Split 5 into 2,1,2. Now list is [2,1,2,0,5].

Split 5 into 2,1,2. Now list is [2,1,2,0,2,1,2].

Split each 2 into 1,0,1. Let's take the first 2: becomes [1,0,1,1,2,0,2,1,2]. Then split the next 2, etc. But this depends on the order of splits. 

Wait, perhaps the example's note is not the full expansion. Because according to the problem statement, all elements must be split until they are 0 or 1. So the final list for x=10 must have len(10) equal to 15 according to the recursive formula, but the example shows len 13. So this suggests that my formula is wrong, and I need to find another approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the example's note is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the splitting process. Let's check the example again.

The problem's second example input is 10, l=3, r=10. The output is 5. The note says the list after splitting is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1], which is 13 elements. But according to the recursive len formula, len(10) is 15. So the example's note contradicts the formula. This suggests that the formula is not correct. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong. 

So perhaps the len function isn't calculated as 2* len(x//2) +1. Let's think again. 

Each time x is split into a, b, c (a and c are x//2, b is x%2). Then a and c are split as well if they are greater than 1. 

The final list is built by replacing each x>1 with the sequence a, b, c. So the process is:

For example, x=2:

Split into 1,0,1. So len(2) is 3. 

x=3: split into 1,1,1. len(3) is 3. 

x=5: split into 2,1,2. Each 2 is split into 1,0,1. So the final list for 5 is [1,0,1, 1, 1,0,1], which is 7 elements. So len(5) is 7. 

So for x=10, which splits into 5,0,5. len(10) would be 7 (for each 5) *2 +1 (for the 0) =7*2 +1=15. But according to the example, the final list is 13 elements. So there's a discrepancy. 

But in the example's note, the list is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. Let's count: 1 (position 1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 0 (6), 1 (7), 0 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10), 1 (11), 0 (12), 1 (13). So 13 elements. But according to the formula, it's 15. So this suggests that the formula is incorrect. 

This indicates that the formula is not correct. So what's the correct way to model the len(x) function?

Wait, maybe the splitting is done in a way that when x is 1 or 0, no split occurs. So the len(x) is 1 if x is 0 or 1. Otherwise, len(x) is 2* len(x//2) +1. 

Wait, for x=2: len(2) = 2* len(1) +1 = 2*1 +1=3. Which matches. 

x=3: len(3) = 2* len(1) +1=3. Correct. 

x=5: len(5) = 2* len(2) +1=2*3+1=7. Which would give a list of 7 elements. But when you split 5 into 2,1,2, which are then split into 1,0,1 and 1,0,1. So the final list is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1], which is 7 elements. So that's correct. 

For x=10, splitting into 5,0,5. Each 5 is len 7. So len(10) is 7 +1 +7 =15. But the example's note shows len 13. So this is a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the example's note is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, maybe the example's note isn't the full expansion. Let's re-examine the example's note:

"For the second example:

[10] → [5,0,5] → [2,1,2,0,5] → ... ?"

Wait, perhaps the example's note is abbreviating the steps. But according to the problem statement, the final list must have all elements 0 or 1. So let's process the example step by step.

Original list: [10].

Step 1: Split 10 into 5,0,5 → [5,0,5].

Step 2: Split the first 5 into 2,1,2 → [2,1,2,0,5].

Step 3: Split the next 5 into 2,1,2 → [2,1,2,0,2,1,2].

Now the list has elements 2,1,2,0,2,1,2.

Now split each 2:

Step 4: Split first 2 into 1,0,1 → [1,0,1,1,2,0,2,1,2].

Wait, no. Because in this step, when you split the first 2 (element at position 1), you replace it with 1,0,1. So the list becomes [1,0,1,1,2,0,2,1,2].

Then split the next 2 (position 5) → replace with 1,0,1 → list becomes [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,1,2].

Then split the 2 in position 8 → replace with 1,0,1 → list becomes [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,2].

Then split the 2 in position 12 → replace with 1,0,1 → list becomes [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1].

So the final list has 15 elements. But the example's note says that for n=10, the final list is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1], which is 13 elements. This suggests that the example's note is either wrong or the process stops earlier. 

But according to the problem statement, Sam must continue until all elements are 0 or 1. So the example's note must be wrong, which is unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the order in which elements are split affects the structure of the list. For example, if elements are split in a certain order, perhaps some splits are not necessary. But according to the problem statement, all elements must be split until they are 0 or 1. So regardless of the order, the final list should contain all elements 0 or 1. 

So perhaps the example's note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So what's wrong here?

Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the splitting process. Let's re-read the problem statement.

The problem says: In each operation, Sam must remove any element x>1 and insert floor(x/2), x mod 2, floor(x/2) sequentially. He must continue until all elements are 0 or 1.

So each operation involves splitting a single x>1 into three elements. So each operation is a single split. So the process continues until no elements are left that are greater than 1. So the order of splitting could affect the positions of elements, but the final list should be the same as if all splits are done recursively. 

Wait, but no. For example, splitting the left elements first versus the right elements first could change the order in which the splits occur and thus the structure of the list. But according to the problem statement, the final list should be the same. So perhaps the final list is determined by the original value of n, regardless of the order of splitting. 

But that seems unlikely. For example, consider n=3. The first split produces [1,1,1]. So it's done. The list is three 1s. 

But if we have n=4. The first split is 4 → 2,0,2. Then, split each 2. Suppose we split the left 2 first into 1,0,1. Then the list becomes [1,0,1,0,2]. Then split the right 2 into 1,0,1. So the list is [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]. The len is 7. If we split the right 2 first, the process would lead to the same len 7. So the order doesn't matter. 

So the final list's structure depends only on the initial value of n, and the order of splitting doesn't affect it. Therefore, the len(x) function is correct. So the example's note must be wrong. But that's not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note for the second example is incorrect. Let's look at the second example:

Input: 10 3 10 → Output:5.

The final list according to the note is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. So positions 3-10 are [1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0], which has 5 ones. 

But according to the len formula, the list length should be 15. So the positions 3-10 would be the third to tenth elements in a list of 15. But according to the note, the list is length 13. So this suggests that my approach is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the len(x) is not 2* len(x//2) +1 for x>1. Let me think of another way to model the list's length. 

Wait, when you split x into a, b, c, the length increases by 2 (since replacing one element with three). So the total len(x) is 1 (original x) + 2* (number of splits). But the number of splits depends on how many times x and its parts are split. 

Alternatively, the len(x) can be determined as follows:

If x is 0 or 1: len is 1.

Else: len(x) = len(a) + 1 + len(c), where a and c are x//2. But a and c are the same as x//2. So len(x) = 2 * len(x//2) +1. 

But according to this formula, for x=10:

x//2 =5 → len(5)=7. So len(10)=2*7+1=15.

But the example shows len 13. So this is a contradiction. 

Hmm. So there's a problem here. How to resolve this?

Alternatively, perhaps the example's note is wrong, but the correct answer is 5. Let's check the example's note.

The example says the list after splitting is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. Let's count the number of elements: 13. The positions 3-10 are 1-based indices. So the third element is 1, fourth is 1, fifth 1, sixth 0, seventh 1, eighth 0, ninth 1, tenth 1. So the elements from 3 to 10 are 1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1. That's 6 ones, but the output is 5. Wait, this suggests that the example's note is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the example's note is a typo. Let's try to calculate the correct answer for input 10 3 10. 

Assuming that the final list is 15 elements long:

The list for x=10 would be the list for 5 (len 7), followed by 0, followed by the list for 5 (len 7). So the first 7 elements are for 5, then 0, then 7 elements for 5. 

The list for 5 is [1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. So the first 7 elements of the list for 10 are [1,0,1,1,1,0,1], followed by 0, followed by [1,0,1,1,1,0,1]. So the entire list is 7 +1 +7=15 elements. 

So the list is:

positions 1-7: 1,0,1,1,1,0,1

position 8:0

positions 9-15: 1,0,1,1,1,0,1

So the entire list is:

1 (pos1), 0 (2),1 (3),1 (4),1 (5),0 (6),1 (7), 0 (8), 1 (9), 0 (10), 1 (11),1 (12),1 (13),0 (14),1 (15).

Wait, but the positions 3-10 would be:

pos3:1, pos4:1, pos5:1, pos6:0, pos7:1, pos8:0, pos9:1, pos10:0. 

So in this case, the count is 1 (pos3) +1 (4) +1 (5) +1 (7) +1 (9) =5 ones. Which matches the example's output of 5. 

So the correct list is 15 elements long, and the example's note has a typo. So the len(x) formula is correct, and the example's note must have a mistake in the list representation. 

So the approach is to model the list as a recursive structure. For a given x, the list is formed by the list of x//2, then x%2, then x//2. 

The problem requires counting the number of 1s between positions l and r. 

But since the list can be very large (for n up to 2^50, len(n) can be up to 2^(51) -1, which is way too big to handle directly), we need a way to compute the count without generating the list. 

The key is to model the list as a binary tree-like structure, where each node contributes a certain number of 1s in a certain range. 

So, for a given x, the list is:

left_part (from x//2) + [x%2] + right_part (from x//2). 

The total length is len(x) = 2 * len(x//2) +1.

To count the number of 1s in a range [L, R], we can represent this recursively. For a given x, the list is composed of left_part (length len_left = len(x//2)), then the middle element (x%2), then the right_part (length len_right = len(x//2)). 

So when we need to find the count in [L, R], we can check which parts of the current x's list are covered by the query range. 

For example, suppose the current x's list has length LEN = 2*LEN_HALF +1. 

If the query range [L, R] is entirely in the left part (R <= LEN_HALF), then the count is the same as the count in the left_part for x//2, in the same range [L, R]. 

If the query range includes the middle element (L <= LEN_HALF +1 <= R), then we need to add the middle element's value (x%2) to the count. 

If part of the query is in the right_part (after the middle), then we need to compute the count in the right_part for x//2, but adjusted by the offset (LEN_HALF +1 +1). 

The base case is when x is 0 or 1. Then, the count is 1 if x is 1 and the query includes the position, else 0. 

So the approach is to recursively split the query into the left, middle, and right parts of the current x's list. 

But to compute this efficiently, we need to know the length of the left part (len_half) for each x. 

But for large x (up to 2^50), we can't compute len(x//2) recursively each time, as that would take O(log x) time per call and stack depth would be too large. 

So, to compute len(x) efficiently, we can precompute the length for x//2 recursively, but memoize the results. However, for x up to 2^50, the number of unique x's would be O(log n), since each time x is divided by 2. So memoization is feasible. 

Alternatively, len(x) can be computed as follows:

Each time x is split, the length of the list for x is 2 * len(x//2) +1. 

So len(x) is the same as (2^(k+1) ) -1, where k is the number of times x can be split until it's 0 or 1. 

Wait, perhaps not. For x=3: split into 1,1,1. len is 3. 

For x=5: split into 2,1,2. len(2)=3. So len(5)=2*3+1=7. 

For x=7: split into 3,1,3. len(3)=3. len(7)=2*3+1=7. 

So for x=7, which is binary 111 (3 bits), len(x)=7=2^3 -1. 

For x=5, which is 101 (3 bits), len(x)=7=2^3 -1. 

x=10 is 1010 (4 bits), len(x)=2*7+1=15=2^4 -1. 

Ah, so it's possible that len(x) is (2^m) -1, where m is the number of times x can be split. Wait, no. For example, x=2: splits into 1,0,1. len is 3=2^2-1. x=2 is binary 10 (2 bits). So m=2. 

x=1: len is 1=2^1-1. 

x=0: len is 1=2^1-1. 

So it seems that len(x) is equal to (2^m -1), where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x. But wait, x=5 is 101 (3 bits), len is 7=2^3-1. 

x=6 is 110 (3 bits), len is 7. 

x=4 is 100 (3 bits), len is 7. 

Yes, this seems to hold. So len(x) is 2^m -1, where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x. 

Wait, but wait: len(4) is 2* len(2) +1. len(2) is 3. So len(4) is 7. 

But 4 in binary is 100 (3 bits). 2^3-1=7. Yes. 

So the len(x) is (2^m -1), where m is the number of bits in x's binary representation. 

Wait, but this would imply that all numbers with the same number of bits in their binary representation have the same len. For example, x=5 (101, 3 bits) and x=4 (100, 3 bits) both have len 7. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So the formula for len(x) is 2^m -1, where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x. 

So for x=0, binary is 0 (1 bit) → len is 1. 

x=1 (1 bit) → len 1. 

x=2 (10, 2 bits) → len 3. 

But wait, x=2's len is 3=2^2-1. 

Wait, but 2 in binary is 10, which is two bits, so m=2. 2^2-1=3. Correct. 

So yes, the len(x) is 2^m -1, where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x. 

But how do we compute m for a given x? 

For x=0, m is 1. For x>0, m is the floor of log2(x) +1. 

Yes. 

So for x=0, m=1. len=1. 

For x=1, m=1. len=1. 

For x=2, log2(2)=1 → m=2. 

For x=3, log2(3)=1.58 → m=2. So len is 3. But wait, len(3) is 3. According to the formula, 2^m-1. m=2 → 3. Which matches. 

x=4: log2(4)=2 → m=3. 2^3-1=7. Correct. 

x=10: log2(10)=3.32 → m=4. 2^4-1=15. Which matches the example's correct len. 

So the len(x) is 2^m -1, where m is the number of bits in the binary representation of x, including leading zeros for x=0. 

So how does this help us? 

We can precompute len(x) as 2^m -1. 

Now, the problem is to compute the number of 1s between positions l and r in the final list. 

The approach is to model this recursively. For a given x, the list is left_part (len_half) + [x%2] + right_part (len_half). 

For a query range [L, R], we need to determine which parts of the list are covered by the range. 

So, for the current x, the total length is len(x) = len_half *2 +1. 

We can split the query into three parts:

1. Left part: if L <= len_half, then part of the left_part is included. 

2. Middle part: if L <= len_half +1 <= R, then include x%2. 

3. Right part: if R > len_half +1, then part of the right_part is included. 

We can calculate the contribution of each part recursively. 

The base cases are when x is 0 or 1. If x is 0, the contribution is 0. If x is 1, the contribution is 1 if the position is within [L, R]. 

But since the len(x) can be up to 2^50, we need to handle the recursion efficiently. 

The key is to memoize the count function. However, for x up to 2^50, we can't memoize all possible x. But since each recursive step reduces x by a factor of 2, the recursion depth is O(log x), which is manageable. 

So the steps are:

Define a helper function count_ones(x, pos_L, pos_R) that returns the number of 1s between pos_L and pos_R in the list generated by x. 

But pos_L and pos_R are positions in the list. 

Wait, but how do we track the current position range for each x? Alternatively, the helper function can compute the number of 1s in the list for x in the range [L, R], where L and R are global positions. 

But this requires knowing the start and end positions of the current x's list in the global list. 

Alternatively, the helper function can compute for a given x and a query range [a, b], where a and b are the start and end of the current x's list. 

But that's not practical. 

Alternatively, the helper function can compute the number of 1s in the range [global_L, global_R], given that the current x's list starts at start and ends at end. 

But since the list is built recursively, each x's list is a contiguous block. So, for example, the root x is the entire list (start=1, end=len(x)). 

The left_part of x starts at start and ends at start + len_half -1. 

The middle is at start + len_half. 

The right_part starts at start + len_half +1 and ends at end. 

So the helper function can take parameters x, a (start of current segment), b (end of current segment), L (global query start), R (global query end). 

The function returns the number of 1s in the current segment's list between L and R. 

The base cases are:

- If x is 0: return 0 if L <= a <= b <= R, else 0. 

Wait, no. If x is 0, then the list is just [0], so the count is 0. 

So if x is 0 or 1, then the current segment is a single element. 

If a > R or b < L: return 0. 

Else, if x is 1 and the current segment's [a, b] intersects with [L, R], then return 1. 

Otherwise, 0. 

For x>1:

Compute len_half = (current_len -1)//2, since current_len = 2* len_half +1. 

current_len is (b -a +1). 

Wait, no. The current segment has start a and end b. The current_len is (b -a +1). Which must equal len(x). 

But len(x) is 2^m -1. So for example, if x is 10 (len 15), a=1, b=15. 

The helper function can be defined as follows:

def count(x, a, b, L, R):

    if b < L or a > R:

        return 0

    if x == 0:

        return 0

    if x == 1:

        return 1 if (L <= a <= R) or (L <= b <= R) or (a >= L and b <= R) else 0

    # compute len_half for x.

    len_half = (get_len(x) -1) //2

    # left_part starts at a, ends at a + len_half -1

    left_start = a

    left_end = a + len_half -1

    # middle is at a + len_half

    middle_pos = a + len_half

    # right_part starts at middle_pos +1, ends at b

    right_start = middle_pos +1

    right_end = b

    cnt = 0

    # check left part

    cnt += count(x//2, left_start, left_end, L, R)

    # check middle

    if L <= middle_pos <= R:

        cnt += x %2

    # check right part

    cnt += count(x//2, right_start, right_end, L, R)

    return cnt

But how do we compute get_len(x)? 

get_len(x) can be computed as (2^m -1), where m is the number of bits in x's binary representation. 

For x=0, m=1. 

For x>0, m is the floor(log2(x)) +1. 

But calculating m for x can be done by finding the highest set bit. 

Alternatively, for x>0, m is the bit length of x. 

In Python, x.bit_length() gives the number of bits required to represent x in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. For example, 0.bit_length() is 0, but for x>0, x.bit_length() is m. 

But for x=0, we need to handle it as a special case, since len(x) is 1. 

So:

def get_len(x):

    if x ==0:

        return 1

    m = x.bit_length()

    return (1 << m) -1

But wait, for x=1, m=1 → len is 1<<1 -1=1, correct. 

For x=2, m=2 → len=3, correct. 

For x=10, m=4 → len=15. 

Yes. 

So with this get_len function, the helper function can proceed. 

But the helper function needs to know the start and end positions of the current segment. 

So, the initial call would be count(n, 1, get_len(n), l, r). 

This approach should work. 

Now, the problem is to compute this efficiently. 

But for x up to 2^50, the recursion depth would be O(log x), which is acceptable. 

But for each call to count(x, a, b, L, R), we need to compute get_len(x//2). 

But for x//2, since we are passing it recursively, the get_len function can be computed each time. 

So, the code would look something like this:

def main():

    n, l, r = map(int, input().split())

    def get_len(x):

        if x ==0:

            return 1

        m = x.bit_length()

        return (1 << m) -1

    def count(x, a, b, L, R):

        if b < L or a > R:

            return 0

        if x ==0:

            return 0

        if x ==1:

            return 1 if (a >= L and a <= R) else 0

        len_half = (get_len(x) -1) //2

        left_start = a

        left_end = a + len_half -1

        middle_pos = left_end +1

        right_start = middle_pos +1

        right_end = b

        # compute left part contribution

        left = count(x//2, left_start, left_end, L, R)

        # compute middle

        middle = 0

        if L <= middle_pos <= R:

            middle = x %2

        # compute right part

        right = count(x//2, right_start, right_end, L, R)

        return left + middle + right

    total_len = get_len(n)

    result = count(n, 1, total_len, l, r)

    print(result)

But wait, for x=0, the list is [0], so in the count function, when x is 0, we return 0. 

For x=1, the list is [1], so if the current segment's start and end are within [L, R], return 1. 

But in the count function, for x=1, the a and b are the same (since len(x) is 1). So the condition is a >= L and a <= R. 

This should work. 

Let's test the first example:

Input:7 2 5. 

The final list for 7 is 7 elements: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. 

The positions 2-5 are [1,1,1,1], count is 4. 

Let's see what the code returns. 

Call count(7, 1,7, 2,5). 

x=7: get_len(7) is 3 bits → 2^3-1=7. 

len_half = (7-1)//2 =3. 

Left part is positions 1-3. 

Middle is position 4. 

Right part is 5-7. 

The query is 2-5. 

So left part (1-3) overlaps with 2-3. 

Left contribution: count(3,1,3,2,5). 

Now x=3: get_len(3) is 3 (bit_length 2, 2^2-1=3). 

len_half = (3-1)/2=1. 

Left part 1-1. 

Middle is 2. 

Right part 3-3. 

Query is 2-5. 

For left part (1-1): a=1, b=1. Since 1 <2, returns 0. 

Middle is position 2. 2 is within 2-5 → add x%2 =3%2=1. 

Right part (3-3) is 3, which is within 2-5 → count(3//2=1,3,3,2,5). 

x=1, a=3, b=3. 

Check if 3 is between 2-5 → yes. So return 1. 

So count(3,1,3,2,5) returns 0 +1 +1=2. 

Middle of x=7 is position4 → 7%2=1. 

Right part of x=7 is positions5-7. The query includes 5. 

So count(3,5,7,2,5) → a=5, b=7. The query is 2-5. So a=5 is >= L=2 and <= R=5. 

So x=3 again. 

x=3: len is 3. 

len_half=1. 

Left part 5-5. 

Middle 6. 

Right part 7-7. 

But R is 5. So left part is 5-5. 

Call count(3//2=1,5,5,2,5). 

x=1, a=5, b=5. 5 is within 2-5 → returns 1. 

Middle of x=3's right part is position6, which is outside R=5. 

So right part's contribution is 0. 

So count(3,5,7,2,5) returns 1 (left) +0 (middle) +0 (right) =1. 

So total for x=7's right part is 1. 

So overall count is 2 (left part) +1 (middle) +1 (right part) =4. Which matches the example. 

Another test case: second example. 

n=10, l=3, r=10. 

The code should return 5. 

The len(n=10) is 15. 

The query is 3-10. 

Let's see:

Initial call to count(10, 1,15,3,10). 

x=10: get_len(10) is 4 bits → 2^4-1=15. 

len_half=(15-1)//2=7. 

Left part: 1-7. 

Middle:8. 

Right part:9-15. 

Query 3-10 includes left part (3-7), middle (8), and right part (9-10). 

Left part contribution: count(5,1-7,3-10). 

x=5: len is 7. 

len_half=3. 

Left part:1-3, middle4, right5-7. 

Query3-7. 

Left part (1-3): overlap with 3 → count(2,1-3,3-7). 

Wait, this is getting complicated. But the code should correctly compute the sum. 

In any case, the code seems to handle the examples correctly. 

Now, to optimize this code for speed. 

The code as written uses recursion. For x up to 2^50, the recursion depth is O(log x), which is 50 steps. So it's acceptable. 

But for Python, recursion depth is limited. The default recursion depth is 1000. So for 50 steps, it's okay. 

But for x=2^50, the recursion depth would be 50 levels. 

So the code should work. 

But we can memoize the get_len function. 

Alternatively, compute len_half for x as (get_len(x) -1)//2. 

But the get_len function is O(1) in Python. 

Another optimization: precompute get_len(x//2). 

But the code is already efficient. 

So the code should work. 

Testing the second example:

n=10, l=3, r=10. 

The code's initial call is count(10, 1,15,3,10). 

x=10: get_len is 15. len_half=7. 

Left part:1-7. 

Middle:8. 

Right part:9-15. 

Left part contribution: count(5,1-7,3-10). 

x=5: len is 7. len_half=3. 

Left part:1-3. 

Middle:4. 

Right part:5-7. 

The query is 3-10. 

So in count(5,1-7,3-10):

Check the left part (1-3): only position3 is within query. 

count(2,1-3,3-10). 

x=2: len is 3. len_half=1. 

Left part:1-1. 

Middle:2. 

Right part:3-3. 

In query 3-10: middle is 2, which is outside. Right part is3. 

So for left part (1-1), no contribution. 

Middle (2) no. 

Right part (3-3), which is in query. 

So count(2//2=1,3,3,3,10). x=1, returns 1. 

So count(2,1-3,3-10) returns 0 (left) +0 (middle) +1 (right) =1. 

Middle of x=5 is position4. 4 is within 3-10. x=5%2=1. So adds 1. 

Right part of x=5 is 5-7. 

count(2,5-7,3-10). 

x=2, len=3. 

left part:5-5. 

middle:6. 

right part:7-7. 

Query is 3-10. 

Left part 5-5: yes. count(1,5-5,3-10) returns 1. 

middle 6 is within 3-10. x=2%2=0. 

right part 7-7: yes. count(1,7-7,3-10) returns1. 

So count(2,5-7,3-10) returns1 +0 +1=2. 

So total for x=5's contribution is left=1 (from count(2,1-3)), middle=1, right=2 → total 4. 

Middle of x=10 is 8. x=10%2=0. 

Right part of x=10:9-15. 

count(5,9-15,3-10). 

The query is3-10. The right part starts at9 and ends at15. So the overlapping range is9-10. 

So call count(5,9,15,3,10). 

x=5, a=9, b=15. 

len is 7. len_half=3. 

left part:9-11. 

middle:12. 

right part:13-15. 

Query is9-10. 

left part (9-11):9-10 is part of this. 

So count(2,9-11,9-10). 

x=2's len is3. len_half=1. 

left part9-9. 

middle10. 

right part11-11. 

Query is9-10. 

left part9-9: yes. count(1,9-9,9-10) returns1. 

middle10 is within query. x=2%2=0. 

right part11-11: no. 

So count(2,9-11,9-10) returns1+0+0=1. 

middle of x=5 in this call is12, which is outside query. 

right part13-15: outside query. 

So total for x=5's right part is1. 

So overall, the right part of x=10 contributes 1. 

So total for x=10's call is left=4, middle=0, right=1 → total 5. 

Which matches the example's output. 

Thus, the code works correctly. 

Now, implement this code in Python. 

Note that the code must read n, l, r from input. 

But what about n=0? 

If n=0, the final list is [0], so the count is 0 between any l and r. 

The code handles this, since x=0 returns 0. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

So the final code is as follows.
</think>

```python
n, l, r = map(int, input().split())

def get_len(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    m = x.bit_length()
    return (1 << m) - 1

def count(x, a, b, L, R):
    if b < L or a > R:
        return 0
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    if x == 1:
        return 1 if (a >= L and a <= R) else 0
    total_len = get_len(x)
    len_half = (total_len - 1) // 2
    left_start = a
    left_end = a + len_half - 1
    middle_pos = left_end + 1
    right_start = middle_pos + 1
    right_end = b
    
    left = count(x // 2, left_start, left_end, L, R)
    middle = (x % 2) if (L <= middle_pos <= R) else 0
    right = count(x // 2, right_start, right_end, L, R)
    
    return left + middle + right

total_len = get_len(n)
print(count(n, 1, total_len, l, r))
```
