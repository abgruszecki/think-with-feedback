<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of valid indentations for a given sequence of Python-like statements. The statements are either 'f' (for loops) or 's' (simple statements). The key here is to model the indentation rules correctly.

Hmm, the main thing to remember is that a for loop's body must be indented one level more than its header. And after the for loop's body, the indentation goes back. Also, the body can't be empty. So each 'f' must be followed by at least one line indented deeper. Oh wait, but the problem says that the input is given such that the last line is an 's', which makes sense because a for body can't end with an empty line.

So the problem reduces to calculating the number of ways to assign indentation levels to each line such that the rules are followed. Let's think about dynamic programming here. Because the number of possibilities can be large, and with N up to 5000, we need an O(N²) solution.

Let's model the DP state. Let dp[i][k] be the number of ways to indent the first i lines, where the i-th line has an indentation level of k. The transitions would depend on whether the current line is 'f' or 's'.

Wait, but for a 's' line, the next line can have an indentation level less than or equal to the current's. But for an 'f' line, the next line must be indented one level deeper. Because the body of the for loop must start immediately after, and must be indented. But after the body, the indentation can drop back.

So, for each line i:

If the current command is 'f', then the next line must be indented by k+1. Because the 'f' line's body must have at least one line (the next line must be part of its body). So for a line i that's 'f', the next line (i+1) must be indented exactly k+1.

If the current command is 's', then the next line can be indented any level less than or equal to the current level. Because after a 's' line, the next line can be at the same level (if it's a new statement) or a lower level (if it's outside some loops).

Wait, but how do the indentation levels change? Let's think in terms of a stack. Each 'f' adds a level to the stack, and each time we close a loop body, the level decreases. But the DP approach might model this more directly.

So, let's think of the DP state as the current indentation level. For each step, the current line's indentation level depends on the previous lines and the commands.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to track the current possible indentation levels. For each line, the possible indentation levels are constrained based on the previous line's command and indentation.

Let me rephrase:

- If the previous command was an 's', then the current line can have any indentation level less than or equal to the previous line's level. Because after a simple statement, the next line can be at the same level (if it's a new statement) or a lower level (exiting some loops).

- If the previous command was an 'f', then the current line must be indented exactly one level higher than the previous line. Because the 'f' requires a body, which starts with a deeper indentation.

Wait, but the previous command is the (i-1)th line. So for each i, the command type (s or f) of the (i-1)th line determines the possible indentation level of the ith line.

Wait, the first line must be indentation level 0, right? Because in Python, the first line can't be indented. So for the first line (i=0?), the indentation is 0. Then, for line 1 (i=1), if line 0 was 'f', then line 1 must be indented 1. If line 0 was 's', then line 1 can be any level <=0, which is 0.

Wait, but the first line can't be indented. So line 0's indentation is 0. But the first line's command can be 'f' or 's'. Let's consider the initial conditions.

So the DP approach would track for each line i, the possible indentation levels, and the number of ways to reach that level given the previous lines.

The base case is the first line (i=0) with indentation level 0.

For line i >=1, the possible indentation level depends on the command of line i-1.

Let's consider each step:

For each line from 1 to N-1:

If the (i-1)th line's command is 'f', then the ith line must be indented exactly (prev_level + 1). So the current line's indentation is forced.

If the (i-1)th line's command is 's', then the current line's indentation can be any level less than or equal to the (i-1)th line's indentation level. So for the ith line, the possible indentation levels are from 0 up to prev_level.

But how does this translate into transitions for the DP?

Let's model the DP as follows:

We can have a DP array where dp[i][k] represents the number of ways to have the ith line indented at level k.

But with N up to 5000 and k up to 5000 (since each 'f' increases the level by 1, and there can be up to N 'f's in a row), this would be O(N²), which for N=5000 would be 25 million. That's manageable, but we need to optimize space.

Wait, but for each i, we only need the previous line's DP values. So we can use a 1D array and update it in reverse order or something.

Let me think again.

Initialize for the first line (i=0). If the first command is 's', then the indentation level is 0. If it's 'f', the indentation is 0 (but the next line must be 1).

Wait, the first line's indentation is 0 regardless. Because all code starts at indentation level 0.

Wait, the problem says that the input is given as a sequence of commands, and we need to assign indentation levels. So the first line must be indentation level 0. Then, the next line's indentation depends on whether the first line was 'f' or 's'.

So for the first line (i=0):

command = lines[0]

since the first line must have indentation 0, so dp[0][0] = 1.

Then, for each subsequent line i (from 1 to N-1):

If the previous command (i-1) was 'f', then the current line's indentation must be (prev_level + 1). So for each possible prev_level in dp[i-1], the current level is prev_level + 1.

But wait, the previous command is lines[i-1], so for line i:

If lines[i-1] is 'f', then current level must be prev_level + 1.

If lines[i-1] is 's', then current level can be any level <= prev_level.

So the transitions are as follows:

For each i in 1 to N-1:

prev_cmd = lines[i-1]

current_cmd = lines[i]

if prev_cmd is 'f':

   current_level must be prev_level + 1.

   So for each possible prev_level in the previous step (i-1), the current level is prev_level + 1.

   So dp[i][prev_level + 1] += dp[i-1][prev_level]

else (prev_cmd is 's'):

   current_level can be any level up to prev_level.

   So for each prev_level in the previous step (i-1), the current level can be 0 to prev_level.

   So the number of ways for each possible current_level k is the sum of dp[i-1][prev_level] for all prev_level >= k.

Wait, no. If prev_cmd is 's', then for the current line (i), the indentation level can be any level <= the previous line's level.

So for each possible k (current level), the previous line's level must be >=k.

So for current level k, the sum over all possible prev_level >=k of dp[i-1][prev_level].

But for prev_cmd is 's', the current level can be any value from 0 up to the previous level.

So for each possible current k, we sum all dp[i-1][prev_level] where prev_level >=k.

This seems like a O(N²) approach, but we can optimize this sum using prefix sums.

Yes, because for each i, when prev_cmd is 's', the current k can range from 0 to some maximum (like up to the maximum possible previous level). To compute the sum for each k, we can precompute a prefix sum array where for each position j, sum_s[j] is the sum of dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1], ..., dp[i-1][max_level].

Then for each k, the number of ways is sum_s[k], which is the sum from j=k to max_level of dp[i-1][j].

This way, for each i where prev_cmd is 's', the transitions can be done in O(N) time using prefix sums.

So the plan is:

- Use dynamic programming with a DP array that tracks the current possible levels and their counts.

- For each line, depending on the previous command, compute the possible current levels.

- For 'f' transitions, current level is prev_level + 1.

- For 's' transitions, current level is any k <= prev_level, which can be efficiently computed using prefix sums.

Now, considering the constraints:

N can be up to 5000, and for each step, we can process O(N) possibilities. The total time should be O(N²), which for 5000 is 25 million operations. That's manageable in Python with optimizations.

But for space, if we use a 2D array, it's O(N²) which is 25 million entries, but each is a number. However, with Python's memory, that might be tight. So we can optimize space by using two 1D arrays: previous and current.

So for each i, we only need to keep track of the current line's possible levels, which can be built from the previous line's data.

So the steps would be:

Initialize prev_dp as a list where prev_dp[0] = 1 (since the first line is level 0).

For each i from 1 to N-1:

   current_dp is a new list.

   if the previous command (lines[i-1]) is 'f':

       for each possible prev_level in prev_dp where prev_dp[prev_level] > 0:

           current_level = prev_level + 1

           current_dp[current_level] += prev_dp[prev_level]

   else (prev_cmd is 's'):

       compute the prefix sums of prev_dp in reverse order.

       for each possible current_level k from 0 up to max_prev_level:

           current_dp[k] = sum of prev_dp[k ... max_prev_level]

           which can be done using the prefix sum array.

So for the 's' case, building a prefix sum array where sum_from_k = sum_{j=k}^max_prev_level prev_dp[j]

Then for each k, current_dp[k] = sum_from_k.

The key here is to precompute the prefix sums for the previous DP array in reverse order.

Now, let's think about how to handle the indices.

For example, when prev_cmd is 's', the current_level can be any value up to the previous_level. So for each possible k (current level), the sum of all prev_level >=k in prev_dp.

So for the 's' case, the sum for k is the sum of prev_dp[k], prev_dp[k+1], ..., prev_dp[max_level].

To compute this efficiently, we can precompute a suffix sum array for prev_dp.

So for the 's' transitions:

max_level_prev = maximum possible level in prev_dp.

Create a suffix array where suffix_sums[k] = sum of prev_dp[k] + suffix_sums[k+1]

But in practice, since in Python, for each i, the possible levels can be up to i (since each 'f' increases the level by 1, and the maximum possible level after i steps is i).

Wait, but for each line i, the maximum possible level can't exceed i. For example, the first line is level 0. If the next lines are all 'f's, then each step increases the level by 1. So line i can have level up to i.

But given that N can be 5000, the maximum possible level is 5000. So for each step, the possible levels are up to i (for line i, 0-based index).

But handling this with arrays in Python requires that for each line, the current_dp array can be up to 5000 elements. Since N is 5000, the total space for two arrays (previous and current) is O(2*5000) = 10000, which is manageable.

So the algorithm steps would be:

Initialize:

prev_dp is a list where prev_dp[k] is the number of ways to have the previous line (i-1) at level k.

Initially, for i=0 (the first line), prev_dp is [1] (only level 0).

For each line i from 1 to N-1:

   current command is lines[i], but the transition depends on the previous command (lines[i-1]).

   So:

   prev_cmd = lines[i-1]

   if prev_cmd is 'f':

       current_dp is a new list initialized with all zeros.

       for each level k in prev_dp where prev_dp[k] > 0:

           current_level = k + 1

           current_dp[current_level] += prev_dp[k]

           (since all 'f' transitions must increase level by 1)

       But since the previous line was 'f', the current line must be exactly k+1. So the current_dp will have entries only for k_prev +1.

   else (prev_cmd is 's'):

       create a suffix sum array for prev_dp.

       For example, suffix_sums[k] = sum_{m=k}^{max_level} prev_dp[m]

       Then, for each current_level k in 0 ... max_possible_prev_level:

           current_dp[k] = suffix_sums[k]

       So the current_dp is built by taking the suffix sums.

   Then, set prev_dp to current_dp for the next iteration.

Finally, after processing all lines, the answer is the sum of all possible levels in the last line's dp. But wait, the last line is an 's', and after that, there's no more lines. But the sum of all possible ways to reach the last line's levels is the answer.

Wait, yes. Because the problem is to count all valid indentations for the entire sequence. So the answer is the sum of all entries in the prev_dp array after processing all N lines.

But wait, the last line is the N-th line. Wait, the input is N lines. The first line is i=0, up to i=N-1.

So after processing all N lines, the prev_dp array holds the possible indentation levels for the last line (i=N-1). The answer is the sum of all values in prev_dp.

Wait, but let's check the examples.

In the first example:

Input:

4

s

f

f

s

The first line is 's' (indent 0). The second line is 'f', so its next line must be indent 1. The third line is 'f', so next must be 2. The fourth line is 's', which can be at any level <= previous (but previous is 'f', so the third line's indent is 2, so fourth line's indent must be 3. But the last line is 's', and the third line is 'f', so the fourth line must be indent 3.

Wait, but according to the first example's output, there's only one way.

In that case, the sum of the prev_dp for the last line (fourth line) is 1. So the sum is correct.

In the second example:

4

f

s

f

s

The first line is 'f' (indent 0). The second line must be indent 1 (since prev is 'f'). Second line is 's'. The third line can be any indent <=1. So third line is 'f', which can be at 0, 1.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Line 0: 'f' (indent 0). So line 1 must be indent 1 (since line 0 is 'f').

Line 1 is 's'. Line 2 is 'f', which must have an indentation level that is determined by line 1's command. Line 1 is 's', so line 2 can be any level <= line 1's indent (1). So line 2 can be 0 or 1.

If line 2 is 0: Then line 2's command is 'f', so line 3 must be 1.

If line 2 is 1: line 3 must be 2.

But line 3 is 's'. So in the first case, line 3's indent is 1. In the second case, 2. So total two ways. Which matches the example.

So the sum of the prev_dp for the last line (line 3) would be 2.

So the approach is correct.

Now, the implementation.

But how to handle the suffix sums efficiently.

Let's code this step by step.

First, read N and the list of commands.

Then, initialize prev_dp as a list where prev_dp[0] = 1.

Then, for each line from 1 to N-1 (since Python is 0-based), process the transitions.

For each step:

prev_cmd = commands[i-1]

current_dp is a new array.

If prev_cmd is 'f':

   current_level is prev_level +1.

   So for each level in prev_dp, if prev_dp[level] is non-zero, we add that to current_dp[level+1].

   But how to represent prev_dp? Using a list where index is the level.

   So current_dp can be a new list initialized with 0s, of length (max_level_prev +1 +1), but to avoid index issues, perhaps using a dictionary or a list that dynamically expands.

Wait, but using a list would be more efficient.

But in Python, lists can be managed by pre-allocating up to the maximum possible level.

At each step, the maximum level possible for i-th line is i (since each 'f' increases the level by 1, and there can be up to i 'f's in a row). So for line i, the maximum possible level is i.

So for each line, the current_dp can be a list of size (i+1), initialized to 0.

But perhaps it's easier to use a dictionary for the levels where the count is non-zero, but that might be slower for large N.

Alternatively, for each step, we can use a list where the index is the level, and the value is the count. For the 'f' case, the current_dp will have level k+1 for each k in prev_dp's levels.

But how to handle that:

For example, prev_dp is a list where prev_dp[k] is the count for level k.

If prev_cmd is 'f', then for each k where prev_dp[k] >0, current_dp[k+1] += prev_dp[k].

So in code:

current_dp = [0] * (max_prev_level + 2)  # since k+1 could be up to max_prev_level +1

for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

    if prev_dp[k] > 0:

        current_dp[k+1] += prev_dp[k]

        current_dp[k+1] %= MOD

But handling this with lists can be done as follows.

Wait, but prev_dp is a list that may have non-zero entries up to some level. So for each k in the possible levels, which can be from 0 up to the maximum level in prev_dp.

But in the 'f' case, the next level is k+1. So the current_dp's entries are all 0 except for the levels that are k+1 where prev_dp[k] was non-zero.

So for the 'f' case:

current_dp is a list of size (max_prev_level + 2) initialized to 0.

for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

    if prev_dp[k] == 0:

        continue

    current_dp[k+1] = (current_dp[k+1] + prev_dp[k]) % MOD

But since in the 'f' case, the previous command was 'f', the next line must be k+1. So all the counts from the previous levels are shifted up by 1.

So for the 'f' case, the current_dp is a list where each entry is the sum of prev_dp's entries shifted up by 1.

But how to handle this in code?

Let me think. For example, if the previous line's possible levels are [0: 5, 1:3, 2:2], then for the 'f' case, the next line's levels would be 1, 2, 3, with counts 5, 3, 2.

So in code, the current_dp would be:

current_dp = [0]*(max_prev_level +2)

for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

    if prev_dp[k] >0:

        current_dp[k+1] += prev_dp[k]

But this can be done with a list that is k+1's.

But the problem is that prev_dp may have a lot of zeros. So, to optimize, we can iterate over only the non-zero entries in prev_dp.

But for Python, even if prev_dp is a list of 5000 elements, checking each element in a loop is acceptable.

But for the 'f' case, the code can be:

current_dp = [0]*(len(prev_dp)+1)  # since the maximum possible level is len(prev_dp), which is previous max +1.

for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

    current_dp[k+1] = prev_dp[k]

But wait, if prev_dp is a list where each index represents a level, then len(prev_dp) is the maximum possible level +1. Because for example, prev_dp = [1, 0], then the maximum level is 0. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, prev_dp is a list where the index represents the level, and the value is the count. So for the previous step, the maximum possible level is the highest index in prev_dp with a non-zero value.

But in code, to represent prev_dp, perhaps it's better to have a list where the index is the level, and the length is such that all possible levels are covered.

So for each step i, the current maximum possible level is i.

So when initializing prev_dp for i=0, the list is [1], as level 0 is possible.

For i=1, if prev_cmd is 'f', then current_dp will be [0, prev_dp[0]] (since level 0+1=1).

For 's' transitions, we can have a list up to the previous max level.

So for the 's' case:

Compute the suffix sums for prev_dp.

For example, if prev_dp is [a, b, c, d], then the suffix sums for k=0 is a+b+c+d, for k=1 is b+c+d, etc.

So for each current_level k, current_dp[k] = sum(prev_dp[k:]).

To compute this efficiently, we can precompute the suffix sums once for the entire prev_dp array.

In Python, for the 's' case, we can compute a suffix sum array from the prev_dp, then for each k, current_dp[k] = suffix_sum[k].

So code for the 's' case:

suffix_sum = [0] * (len(prev_dp) + 1)  # to handle k up to len(prev_dp) -1

for k in reversed(range(len(prev_dp))):

    suffix_sum[k] = (suffix_sum[k+1] + prev_dp[k]) % MOD

then, for current_level in 0 to len(prev_dp)-1:

current_dp[current_level] = suffix_sum[current_level]

But what's the maximum possible level in current_dp?

It's the maximum possible level from the 's' transition, which is up to the previous max level.

So the current_dp can have a length of len(prev_dp).

So, in code:

current_dp = [0] * len(prev_dp)

for k in range(len(current_dp)):

    current_dp[k] = suffix_sum[k]

But how to handle when the current_dp's possible levels are from 0 to len(prev_dp)-1.

So putting it all together:

Initialize prev_dp as [1] (level 0 for the first line).

Then, for each i in 1 to N-1:

   prev_cmd = commands[i-1]

   if prev_cmd == 'f':

       current_dp = [0] * (len(prev_dp) + 1)

       for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

           current_dp[k+1] = prev_dp[k] % MOD

   else:

       # compute suffix sums for prev_dp

       suffix_sum = [0] * (len(prev_dp) + 1)

       for k in reversed(range(len(prev_dp))):

           suffix_sum[k] = (suffix_sum[k+1] + prev_dp[k]) % MOD

       current_dp = [0] * len(prev_dp)

       for k in range(len(current_dp)):

           current_dp[k] = suffix_sum[k] % MOD

   prev_dp = current_dp.copy()  # or just assign, but need to manage the list size.

But wait, in Python, list assignments are by reference. So when we assign prev_dp = current_dp, it's a reference. But since we are building current_dp as a new list each time, perhaps it's better to create a new list.

Wait, in the 'f' case, current_dp is of length len(prev_dp)+1. Each entry is 0 except for k+1 positions. So for each k in prev_dp's indices, current_dp[k+1] is set to prev_dp[k].

In the 's' case, current_dp is of length len(prev_dp), and each entry is the suffix sum starting at k.

But for the 's' case, the current_dp can have leading zeros. For example, if prev_dp has entries up to level 5, but the suffix_sum for 0 is the sum of all, and for 1, sum of 1-5, etc.

But this is correct.

Now, the problem is the memory. For N=5000, len(prev_dp) can be up to 5000. So for each step, the current_dp can be of size up to 5000. So the total memory is O(N) which is acceptable.

But in Python, lists can dynamically grow. However, for each step, the current_dp is created as a new list of the required length.

Now, let's test this logic with the first example.

First example:

N=4

commands = ['s', 'f', 'f', 's']

But wait, the first line is 's' (i=0). Then, for i=1, the previous command is i=0's command, which is 's'.

Wait, no. Let's see:

For i in 1 to N-1 (since N is 4, i runs from 0 to 3, but wait, the code loops for each i from 1 to N-1? Or perhaps the code loops for each i from 1 to N-1 (indices 1,2,3) for lines 1, 2, 3 (since the first line is 0-based).

Let me re-express the steps.

Original code:

prev_dp starts as [1] (line 0 is 's', level 0).

Then, for each line from 1 to 3 (i=1, 2, 3):

   prev_cmd = commands[i-1]

So for i=1 (line 1):

   prev_cmd = commands[0] = 's'.

   So 's' case.

   Compute suffix sums for prev_dp (which is [1]).

   suffix_sum[0] = 1, suffix_sum[1] = 0.

   current_dp is [1], of length 1.

   So prev_dp becomes [1].

Then, line i=1 is 'f' (command is 'f').

For i=2 (third line, index 2), previous command is commands[1] = 'f'.

So 'f' case.

current_dp is of length len(prev_dp) +1 = 2.

prev_dp is [1]. So for k=0:

   current_dp[0+1] = 1.

So current_dp is [0, 1].

prev_dp becomes [0, 1].

Then, for i=3 (fourth line, index 3), previous command is commands[2] = 'f'.

So 'f' case again.

current_dp is of length 3 (2+1). So for each k in prev_dp (which is [0,1]):

Wait, prev_dp is [0,1], which is len(prev_dp) = 2.

Wait, prev_dp after the second step (i=2) is [0,1]. Because when i=2, the command was 'f', so current_dp is [0,1] (since len(prev_dp) was 1, and current_dp is len(prev_dp)+1 = 2).

So for k in 0 to 1 (len(prev_dp) is 2):

   if prev_dp[k] is non-zero, then current_dp[k+1] += prev_dp[k].

In prev_dp, indexes 0 and 1:

prev_dp[0] = 0, prev_dp[1] = 1.

So current_dp[1+1] = 1.

So current_dp is [0, 0, 1].

prev_dp becomes [0, 0, 1].

Finally, after processing all lines, the sum of prev_dp is 1. Which matches the first example.

So the code works.

Now, let's look at the second example:

N=4

commands = ['f', 's', 'f', 's']

Line 0: 'f', level 0.

For i=1 (second line), previous command is 'f' (line 0 is 'f').

So 'f' case. prev_dp is [1], so current_dp becomes [0,1].

prev_dp is [0,1].

Line i=1 is 's'.

For i=2 (third line), previous command is 's' (line 1's command is 's').

So 's' case. Compute suffix_sum of prev_dp [0,1].

The suffix_sum for k=1 is 1, for k=0 it's 0+1=1.

current_dp is [1,1].

So for each k in 0 and 1:

current_dp[0] = sum of prev_dp[0..1] = 0 +1 =1.

current_dp[1] = sum of prev_dp[1..1] =1.

prev_dp becomes [1,1].

Then, line i=2's command is 'f'.

For i=3 (fourth line), previous command is 'f' (line 2's command is 'f').

prev_dp is [1,1], so current_dp is of length 3.

For each k in 0 and 1:

current_dp[k+1] += prev_dp[k].

So:

k=0: prev_dp[0] =1. current_dp[1] +=1.

k=1: prev_dp[1] =1. current_dp[2] +=1.

So current_dp is [0,1,1].

prev_dp becomes [0,1,1].

Sum of prev_dp is 0+1+1 =2. Which matches the example.

So the code works.

Now, implement this in Python, handling the MOD and efficient prefix sums.

But the code needs to read from input, process N lines, and output the sum modulo 1e9+7.

Let's proceed to code.

First, read N and the commands.

Then, initialize prev_dp as [1].

Then, loop through each line from 1 to N-1:

   prev_cmd = commands[i-1]

   if prev_cmd is 'f':

       current_dp is a list of len(prev_dp)+1, initialized to 0.

       for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

           current_dp[k+1] = prev_dp[k]

   else:

       compute suffix sums.

       current_dp is a list of len(prev_dp), where current_dp[k] is sum(prev_dp[k:]).

       For efficiency, compute a suffix sum array.

Then, update prev_dp.

Finally, sum all elements in prev_dp and output modulo 1e9+7.

But in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9+7

    N = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    commands = [input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip() for _ in range(N)]

    prev_dp = [1]

    for i in range(1, N):

        prev_cmd = commands[i-1]

        if prev_cmd == 'f':

            # new level is k+1 for each previous k.

            current_dp = [0]*(len(prev_dp) +1)

            for k in range(len(prev_dp)):

                if prev_dp[k]:

                    current_dp[k+1] = prev_dp[k] % MOD

            prev_dp = current_dp

        else:

            # Compute suffix sums.

            m = len(prev_dp)

            suffix = [0]*(m+1)

            for k in reversed(range(m)):

                suffix[k] = (suffix[k+1] + prev_dp[k]) % MOD

            current_dp = [0]*m

            for k in range(m):

                current_dp[k] = suffix[k]

            prev_dp = current_dp

    # Sum all the values in prev_dp modulo MOD

    print(sum(prev_dp) % MOD, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4
f
s
f
s
""",
            "output": \
"""\
2
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example:

4

f

s

f

s

i=1 (prev_cmd 'f'):

current_dp [0,1]

i=2 (prev_cmd 's'):

sum of [0,1] from 0:0+1=1, sum from 1:1.

current_dp is [1,1].

i=3 (prev_cmd 'f'):

current_dp is [0,1,1].

sum is 2.

Which matches.

So the code works for these cases.

But what about time? For N=5000, each iteration is O(N), which is 5000*5000 = 25 million operations. Python can handle this in under 2 seconds.

But in the code for the 's' case, the suffix sum is computed in O(m) steps (m is the length of prev_dp, up to i-1). For each 's' step, it's O(m). So the total time is O(N²), which is acceptable.

Now, space-wise, each prev_dp is a list of up to N elements. For N=5000, each list is 5000 integers, which is manageable.

Thus, the code should work correctly.
</think>

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

n = int(input())
commands = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

prev_dp = [1]

for i in range(1, n):
    cmd_prev = commands[i-1]
    if cmd_prev == 'f':
        new_len = len(prev_dp) + 1
        current_dp = [0] * new_len
        for k in range(len(prev_dp)):
            if prev_dp[k]:
                current_dp[k+1] = prev_dp[k] % MOD
    else:
        m = len(prev_dp)
        suffix = [0] * (m + 1)
        for k in reversed(range(m)):
            suffix[k] = (suffix[k+1] + prev_dp[k]) % MOD
        current_dp = [suffix[k] % MOD for k in range(m)]
    prev_dp = current_dp

print(sum(prev_dp) % MOD)
```
