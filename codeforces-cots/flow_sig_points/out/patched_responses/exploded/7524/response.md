Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate f(i,j) for all pairs (i,j) in an undirected connected graph. The function f(i,j) represents the number of spanning trees that are BFS trees for both i and j simultaneously. And I need to output this for all pairs modulo 998244353. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's understand what a BFS tree is. A BFS tree rooted at s is a spanning tree where the distance from s to every node t in the tree is equal to the shortest path distance in the original graph. So, the tree must preserve all shortest paths from s. Now, for a tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, it needs to satisfy that condition for both roots. So the tree must preserve the shortest distances from x and from y.

So, how do I approach this? Well, for each pair (x,y), I need to find the number of spanning trees that are BFS trees for both. Let's think about the conditions such a tree must satisfy.

Let's denote the distance from x to a node u as dx[u], and similarly dy[u] for y. In the BFS tree for x, each edge must connect nodes in such a way that for every edge (u, v), |dx[u] - dx[v]| = 1. Similarly for y and dy[u]. But the tree must simultaneously satisfy both conditions. So, for each edge in the tree, when considering both x and y, their distances must vary by exactly 1 in both directions? Wait, no. Wait, in a BFS tree, each node's parent is at a distance one less than its own. So, in the tree, the parent of a node u (from x's perspective) is a node at distance dx[u] -1. Similarly for y.

But since the tree is the same for both x and y, the tree must be such that for every node u, both dx[u] and dy[u] are as per their original shortest paths. And in the tree, the paths from x and y to any node must be exactly the shortest paths. So the tree must be a BFS tree for x and y at the same time.

So the first step is to compute, for each x and y, the set of edges that can form such a tree. Let's think about the constraints.

First, for a spanning tree to be a BFS tree for x, it must contain for each node u (other than x) at least one edge that connects u to a node in dx[u]-1. Similarly for y. But the tree must form a spanning tree that satisfies both conditions.

Wait, but the tree is a BFS tree for both x and y. So, for the tree to exist, the original graph must have that the shortest paths from x and y are compatible. Wait, but the problem allows x and y to be any pair, so perhaps for some pairs, there's no such tree. For example, if x and y are in a graph where their BFS trees can't overlap. So first, we need to check for each x and y whether such trees exist, and if so, how many there are.

But how to model this?

Let's consider that for each node u, the BFS tree must have a parent from x's BFS layers and also from y's BFS layers. So, perhaps the edges in the tree must satisfy two conditions: they connect layers for x and layers for y.

Alternatively, for each node u (other than x and y), its parent in the tree must be such that dx[parent] = dx[u] -1 and dy[parent] = dy[u] -1. Wait, that's possible only if for u, dx[u] = dx[parent] +1 and dy[u] = dy[parent] +1. So the parent must be in the intersection of the previous layers for both x and y. But maybe that's too restrictive. Because perhaps in the tree, the parent for u from x's perspective is different from the parent from y's perspective. Wait, but in a tree, each node has exactly one parent. So the same parent must satisfy both conditions.

So, for each node u (not x or y), in the tree, the parent of u must be a node v such that:

dx[v] = dx[u] -1

dy[v] = dy[u] -1

Because in the BFS tree for x, the parent of u is at dx[u]-1. Similarly for y, the parent (along the path from y to u) is at dy[u]-1. But in a tree, the path from x to u and y to u must follow the same parent. So for all nodes u except x and y, the parent must be in both the previous layer of x's BFS and the previous layer of y's BFS. Wait, but that's only if the path from x to u and y to u in the tree must pass through the same parent. But this seems like a necessary condition. Because the tree is a BFS tree for both x and y. So the parent of u in the tree must be a node that is at distance dx[u]-1 from x and dy[u]-1 from y. Otherwise, if the parent is not, then the path from x to u via the parent would have a longer length than the actual shortest path. Similarly for y.

So for the tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, for every node u, the parent in the tree must satisfy dx[v] = dx[u] - 1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. But wait, this would require that dx[u] + dy[u] = dx[v] + dy[v] + 2. So, for each node u (other than x and y), the parent v must be such that dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. But how can that be possible?

Let me think with the first example. Let's take x=1 and y=2.

For node 3 in the example, dx[3] is 2 (distance from 1), dy[3] is 1 (distance from 2). So the parent of 3 in the tree must have dx=1 and dy=0. But dy=0 implies it's y (node 2). So the parent must be node 2. Indeed, in the first example, the tree 1-2-3-4 and 1-4, the parent of 3 is 2. So dx[2] is 1 (distance from x=1), dy[2] is 0 (distance from y=2). So the parent of 3 satisfies dx[parent] = dx[3] -1 (2-1=1), dy[parent] = dy[3] -1 (1-1=0). So yes.

So for the tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, each node u (other than x and y) must have a parent v such that v is at dx[u] -1 in x's BFS layers and dy[u] -1 in y's BFS layers. Also, for x and y, their parents would have to be nodes that are their parents in both BFS trees. But x's parent in the tree (if x is not the root) would be someone at dx[x] -1. But x is the root for x's BFS tree, so dx[x] is 0. So x's parent doesn't exist. Similarly for y.

Wait, but x and y are roots. So for the tree to be a BFS tree for x, x must be the root (so no parent). Similarly for y. So if x and y are different nodes, how can a tree be a BFS tree for both? Because in the tree, x is the root (so parent is none) and y is a node. So for y to also be a root, the tree would have to have y as root, which is possible only if x and y are the same node. Wait, no. That can't be right. Because in a tree, there's exactly one root. So how can a tree be a BFS tree for two different roots x and y?

Wait, the BFS tree is a spanning tree where the paths from the root to all other nodes are the shortest possible. But when the tree is a BFS tree for x and y, the tree must be such that the paths from x to any node are the shortest paths, and the same for y. So for example, if the tree is a star with x as center, then for y to have all shortest paths, y must be adjacent to x and all other nodes must be adjacent to x. So in this case, the tree would satisfy the BFS tree for x, and also for y. But this is possible only if the original graph allows that.

So the key here is that the tree must preserve the shortest paths from both x and y. For this to be possible, the tree must have edges that allow both x and y's shortest paths. So the parent of each node u (except x and y) must satisfy both dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1.

Therefore, for each pair (x,y), the first step is to compute for each node u, the required parent conditions.

So the approach would be:

For each pair (x,y):

1. Compute the shortest distance from x to all nodes (dx) and from y to all nodes (dy).

2. Check if there exists a node u where dx[u] + dy[u] < dx[y] or dy[u] + dx[u] < dy[x]. Wait, not sure. Wait, the original graph is undirected. For the tree to be a BFS tree for x and y, the path from x to y in the tree must be of length dx[y] (the shortest path in the graph). Similarly for the path from y to x. But since the tree is undirected, the path from x to y is the same as from y to x. So dx[y] must equal dy[x], and this must equal the distance between x and y in the graph. Which they are, since dx is the shortest distance.

Wait, yes. Since dx[y] is the shortest distance from x to y, and dy[x] is the shortest distance from y to x, but the graph is undirected, so dx[y] = dy[x]. So that's a given.

But for the tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, the path between x and y in the tree must be exactly the shortest path. So in the tree, x and y must be connected via a path of length dx[y], which is the same as dy[x].

Now, for each node u, the parent in the tree must be a node v such that dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. Because the path from x to u must be of length dx[u], and the path from y to u must be of length dy[u]. So the parent v must be the previous node in both paths.

Therefore, for a tree to satisfy both BFS trees, all edges in the tree must be such that for each edge (u, v), dx[u] and dx[v] differ by exactly 1, and dy[u] and dy[v] differ by exactly 1. Wait, but the edges in the tree can be in either direction. Wait, no, since the tree is undirected, but the BFS tree is built as a directed tree from the root. So for the edges in the tree, when considered as directed from the parent to child, they must be such that the parent is exactly one step closer to x and y than the child.

So for each edge (u, v) in the tree, if u is the parent of v, then dx[u] = dx[v] -1 and dy[u] = dy[v] -1. Or, if v is the parent of u, then dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. Wait, no. Because in the BFS tree, for each node other than x, its parent is at dx-1. So for any edge in the tree, if u is the parent of v (from x's perspective), then dx[u] = dx[v] -1. Similarly, from y's perspective, if u is the parent of v, then dy[u] = dy[v] -1. But since the tree must be a BFS tree for both, the parent (in the tree) of each node must satisfy both conditions.

Wait, but the tree's structure is fixed. So each node except x and y has a parent. For example, consider node u which is not x or y. Its parent in the tree must be such that from x's perspective, the parent is at dx[u]-1, and from y's perspective, the parent is at dy[u]-1. So the parent must be a node that is both in the (dx[u]-1) layer for x and (dy[u]-1) layer for y.

So, for each node u (except x and y), the parent must be a node v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. Because the path from x to u in the tree must be exactly dx[u] steps, so the parent's dx must be dx[u]-1. Similarly for y.

But how can such a node v exist? For example, let's consider x and y and their distances. For any node u, dx[u] + dy[u] >= dx[y], because the shortest path from x to y is dx[y], and the path x->u->y must be at least dx[y]. So dx[u] + dy[u] >= dx[y]. But for the parent v of u, we have dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. So dx[v] + dy[v] = dx[u] -1 + dy[u] -1 = (dx[u] + dy[u]) - 2. So for this to be possible, we must have that dx[u] + dy[u] >= 2, otherwise v's dx[v] + dy[v] could be negative, which is impossible. So for a node u where dx[u] + dy[u] < dx[y], this would not be possible. Wait, but dx[y] is the shortest path from x to y, so for any u, dx[u] + dy[u] >= dx[y], due to the triangle inequality. So equality holds when u is on a shortest path between x and y.

So for nodes u that lie on a shortest path between x and y, dx[u] + dy[u] = dx[y]. For other nodes, it's larger.

So for a node u, the parent v must be such that dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. Let's see if such a v exists. For example, if u is on a shortest path between x and y, then dx[u] + dy[u] = dx[y], so dx[v] + dy[v] = dx[u] + dy[u] - 2 = dx[y] - 2. So as long as there exists a node with dx equal to dx[u]-1 and dy equal to dy[u]-1, then v can be that node.

But how to model this for all nodes? For each node u (other than x and y), we need to check if there's at least one node v where dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. If not, then there are zero possible trees for this pair (x,y). Otherwise, the number of possible trees is the product of the number of choices for each node's parent.

Wait, but the parent must also be connected by an edge in the original graph. Because the tree is a spanning tree of the original graph, so all edges in the tree must be present in the graph. So for a node u, the possible parents v are those nodes that are adjacent to u in the original graph, and satisfy dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1.

So, for each node u (not x or y), the number of possible parents in the tree is the number of neighbors v of u in the graph where dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. The total number of possible trees is the product of these counts for all nodes u (not x and y), multiplied by 1 if x and y are the same, but otherwise, there's an additional condition.

Wait, but the tree must also be connected. However, since we are multiplying the choices for parents (each parent must be connected via an edge in the graph), the tree is built in such a way that each node's parent is in the correct layers, ensuring that the tree is connected.

Wait, but how to ensure that the parent choices form a tree. Because each node except x and y has exactly one parent. So the structure is a tree. However, x and y may need to have parents as well? Wait, no. Because x is the root for its BFS tree, so x cannot have a parent. Similarly, y is the root for its BFS tree, so y cannot have a parent. So how can the tree be a BFS tree for both x and y? Because a tree has exactly one root. So unless x and y are the same node, this seems impossible.

Wait, this is a crucial point. If x and y are different, then the tree must have x as the root (since it's a BFS tree for x), but also y must have a path to x in the tree. But in the BFS tree for x, y is a node in the tree. However, the tree is also a BFS tree for y, meaning that the path from y to any node in the tree must be the shortest possible. So in the tree, the path from y to x must be of length dy[x] (which is equal to dx[y]). But in the BFS tree for x, the path from x to y is of length dx[y]. So the path from y to x in the tree must also be of length dx[y]. Therefore, the tree must have a path from y to x of length dx[y]. But in a tree, there's exactly one path between any two nodes. So for the tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, the path between x and y in the tree must be exactly dx[y] in length (which it is), and all other nodes must have their parents chosen such that their distances from x and y are preserved.

But how can the tree have x and y as roots? Because in a tree, there's only one root. So perhaps the tree is not a root for both, but when considered as a BFS tree for x, it's a tree rooted at x, and when considered as a BFS tree for y, it's a tree rooted at y. But how can that be possible? Because in a tree, the structure is fixed, and the root determines the parent relationships. So for the same tree, when considered as a BFS tree for x, each node's parent is in x's BFS layers. When considered as a BFS tree for y, each node's parent is in y's BFS layers. But how can the same tree satisfy both?

Ah! Because the tree is undirected, but the parent relationships are determined by the root. For example, in a chain x-a-b-y, when considered as a BFS tree for x, the parent of a is x, parent of b is a, parent of y is b. When considered as a BFS tree for y, the parent of b is y, parent of a is b, parent of x is a. So in this tree, the same edges are used, but the parent relationships are reversed for the path between x and y.

In this case, the tree can be a BFS tree for both x and y if and only if the path between x and y in the tree is exactly their shortest path in the graph. For this to be possible, the path must have length dx[y], and the tree must allow each node's parent (from x's perspective) and parent (from y's perspective) to be the appropriate nodes.

But in such a tree, each node along the path from x to y must have their parents set in such a way that for each node u on the path, the parent from x's perspective is the next node towards x, and the parent from y's perspective is the next node towards y. But in the tree, each node (except x and y) on the path has exactly one parent. So how can this be possible?

For example, in the chain x-a-b-y. Let's say dx[y] is 3 (distance from x to y is 3). The path in the tree is x-a-b-y. For node a, from x's perspective, the parent is x. From y's perspective, the parent would be b (since the path from y to a is y-b-a, so a's parent is b). But in the tree, a's parent is x. So the tree cannot satisfy being a BFS tree for both x and y. Because, in the tree, the path from y to a is of length 2 (y to b to a), but if the actual shortest distance dy[a] is 2, then this is correct. But for the tree to be a BFS tree for y, each node's parent must be at dy[u]-1. So a's parent would have to be a node with dy equal to 1 (since dy[a] is 2). Which is node b. But in the tree, a's parent is x. So this would not satisfy the BFS tree for y. So this chain would not be a valid BFS tree for both x and y.

Hmm. So this suggests that for x and y to have a valid BFS tree, the parent of each node u (other than x and y) must be a node that is in both the previous layer of x and the previous layer of y. That is, for u's parent v, dx[v] = dx[u] - 1 and dy[v] = dy[u] - 1. Because only then can the parent satisfy both BFS conditions.

So in the example where x and y are connected via a path of length dx[y], the nodes along this path must have their parents set such that each step reduces both dx and dy by 1. But how?

For example, let x and y be two nodes connected directly by an edge (distance 1). Then dx[y] = 1, dy[x] = 1. Then, for the tree consisting of the edge x-y, this is a BFS tree for x and y. Because for x, the tree is just x connected to y (distance 1). For y, the tree is y connected to x (distance 1). So this tree is a BFS tree for both. So in this case, the parent of x in the tree (from y's perspective) is y, and the parent of y in the tree (from x's perspective) is x. But since the tree is undirected, when considering the BFS tree for x, y is a child of x. When considering the BFS tree for y, x is a child of y. But the tree is the same edge. So the parent of x in the BFS tree for y is y, and the parent of y in the BFS tree for x is x. So the edge x-y is part of both BFS trees. So this edge can be part of a tree that satisfies both.

But in this case, the parent of x (from y's BFS tree perspective) is y, which has dy[y] -1 = 0 -1 = -1. That's impossible. So perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to formalize the conditions.

A tree T is a BFS tree for x and y if:

For all nodes u, the distance from x to u in T is equal to dx[u] (the shortest path in the graph).

And for all nodes u, the distance from y to u in T is equal to dy[u].

But since the tree is undirected, the distance between any two nodes in T is the same as the shortest path in T.

But the tree must preserve the shortest paths from x and y. So, for any u, the path from x to u in T must be exactly dx[u], and the path from y to u in T must be exactly dy[u].

Therefore, the tree must be such that for any u, the path from x to u in T is a shortest path in the graph, and similarly for y.

But how can the tree be a BFS tree for both x and y?

Let me consider the example given in the first test case.

Sample Input 1:

4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 4

The graph is a square: 1 connected to 2 and 4, 2 connected to 3, 3 connected to 4.

Sample Output for f(1,2) is 1. Let's see what that represents.

Looking at the sample output, the first row is 2 1 0 1. So f(1,1) is 2 (the number of BFS trees for x=1, which can have two possible BFS trees: edges 1-2, 2-3, 1-4 (which is the same as 1-4, 4-3, 3-2?), wait but for x=1, the BFS tree must include edges that form layers. So the BFS tree could be 1-2, 2-3, 1-4 (with 1 at layer 0, 2 and 4 at layer 1, 3 at layer 2). Or 1-4, 4-3, 3-2. So two possible BFS trees.

Then, f(1,2) is 1. So there is one tree that is a BFS tree for both 1 and 2.

Which tree is this? According to the note, the tree with red edges is a BFS tree rooted at both 1 and 2. Let's see: perhaps the tree is 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. Then, in this tree:

For node 1, distances to other nodes are 0,1,2,3. But in the original graph, the distance from 1 to 4 is 1 (since there's an edge). So this tree can't be a BFS tree for 1. So this can't be the case.

Wait, maybe the tree is 1-2, 1-4, 2-3. Then, the distance from 1 to 3 is 2 (via 2), which is correct. The distance from 2 to 1 is 1, to 4 is 2 (via 1), but in the original graph, 2 and 4 are connected via 1 (distance 2) or via 3 (distance 3). So the shortest path is 2-1-4 (distance 2). So in the tree, the distance from 2 to 4 is 2 (path 2-1-4), which is the shortest. So this tree would be a BFS tree for 2. But in this tree, for 4's parent from 1's perspective is 1, and from 2's perspective, 4's parent is 1. Wait, but in the tree, 4's parent is 1. So for 2's BFS tree, the parent of 4 would have to be a node at distance dy[4]-1. dy[4] is the distance from 2 to 4, which is 2. So dy[4] -1 is 1. So 4's parent in the BFS tree for 2 must be a node at distance 1 from 2. The node 1 is at distance 1 from 2. So yes. So the parent of 4 is 1. Similarly, node 3's parent is 2. So the tree is a BFS tree for both 1 and 2.

So the tree must be such that for each node u, the parent (in the tree) is a node that is at distance dx[u]-1 from x and dy[u]-1 from y.

So for node 3, dx[3] is 2 (distance from 1), dy[3] is 1 (distance from 2). So parent must be dx=1, dy=0. Which is node 2. So parent is 2.

For node 4: dx is 1, dy is 2. Parent must be dx=0 (so x=1) and dy=1 (nodes with dy=1 are 1 and 3). So parent must be 1. Because 1 has dy=1 (distance from 2 is 1). So 4's parent is 1.

So the tree has edges 1-2 (x and y), 2-3, 1-4. So for this tree, each node's parent (from x's perspective) is as required, and from y's perspective, the parents are:

y is 2. For 2's BFS tree, the root is 2. So node 1's parent is 2. Node 3's parent is 2. Node 4's parent is 1, which in y's BFS tree must be a node at dy[4]-1 = 2-1=1. 1's dy is 1. So yes.

So this tree works. So the count for (1,2) is 1.

So the approach is:

For each pair (x, y):

1. Compute dx[u] for all u (distance from x).

2. Compute dy[u] for all u (distance from y).

3. Check whether for every node u (other than x and y), there exists at least one neighbor v in the graph such that dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. Also, check if the path from x to y in the graph has length dx[y] (which it is by definition). But also, the tree must have a path from x to y of length dx[y], which is the case if the tree is built according to the parent conditions.

4. For each node u (other than x and y), count the number of edges (u, v) in the graph such that dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. The product of these counts for all such u is the number of possible trees for this pair (x, y).

5. However, if x and y are different, then we need to ensure that the path from x to y in the tree has length dx[y]. But the parent conditions ensure that. Because the path from x to y in the tree would have steps where each node on the path has parents that decrease both dx and dy by 1. For example, the path x → a1 → a2 → ... → ak-1 → y would have dx[a1] = 1, dy[a1] = dy[x] -1 + ... but wait, dy[x] is the distance from y to x, which is equal to dx[y]. So for the nodes along the path from x to y, their dx and dy must satisfy dx[a] + dy[a] = dx[y] (since they are on a shortest path between x and y). So each step along the path would decrease dx by 1 and dy by 1. So the number of steps is dx[y], which is correct.

Thus, the total number of trees for (x,y) is the product of the number of valid choices for each node's parent. Each node u (other than x and y) must have at least one valid parent, otherwise the product is zero.

So the steps are:

For each x and y:

- Compute dx and dy using BFS.

- For all u in the graph, check if dx[u] + dy[u] is equal to dx[y]. Because for the path from x to y, dx[u] + dy[u] must equal dx[y], but for other nodes, this may not hold. Wait, no. For any node u, dx[u] + dy[u] >= dx[y] (triangle inequality). But for the tree to be a BFS tree for both x and y, the parents must satisfy dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1. So for each u (other than x and y), dx[u] + dy[u] must be equal to dx[y] + 2k, where k is some integer? Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

For example, take a node u not on the shortest path between x and y. Suppose dx[u] = a, dy[u] = b. Then, the parent v must have dx[v] = a-1, dy[v] = b-1. So the sum dx[v] + dy[v] = (a-1) + (b-1) = a + b - 2. For this to be possible, the parent v must exist. But if a + b - 2 is less than dx[y], then perhaps there's no such node v. So for the chain to be possible, for each u, the sum dx[u] + dy[u] must be at least 2, but this is always true because dx[u] >=0 and dy[u] >=0. However, for non-shortest path nodes, it's possible that dx[u] + dy[u] > dx[y], but the parents would have sum (dx[u] + dy[u] - 2) which could still be >= dx[y]. So this is allowed.

But for the parents to exist for all nodes u (other than x and y), we need that for each u, there exists at least one neighbor v such that dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For each x in 1..n:

   For each y in 1..n:

      Compute dx and dy using BFS.

      Check for all nodes u (other than x and y) whether dx[u] + dy[u] >= dx[y]. (But this is always true due to triangle inequality.)

      For each u (other than x and y), compute the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. Let's call this count c_u.

      If any c_u is zero, then f(x,y) is zero.

      Otherwise, the answer is the product of all c_u modulo 998244353.

Wait, but what about x and y? Let's see:

For x, since it's the root in the BFS tree for x, it has no parent. For y, since the tree must also be a BFS tree for y, but in the tree, y is not the root (unless x=y), then how does that work?

Wait, when x and y are different, the tree must be a BFS tree for x (rooted at x) and for y (rooted at y). So, in the tree, the parent of y must be a node v such that dx[v] = dx[y] -1 and dy[v] = dy[y] -1. But dy[y] is zero, so dy[v] must be -1, which is impossible. So this implies that if x and y are different, then the product must be zero. But that's not the case, as per the sample input.

Wait, this is a problem. Let's take the first sample input where x=1 and y=2. y is node 2. dy[y] is zero. So the parent of y in the tree (from y's BFS tree perspective) would have to be a node with dy[v] = -1, which is impossible. So how does the sample input have a valid tree?

Ah, here's the mistake. The tree is a BFS tree for both x and y. So for y's BFS tree, the root is y, so the parent of y is none. So in the tree, the parent of y (from x's perspective) must be a node v where dx[v] = dx[y] -1. dx[y] is 1 (distance from x=1 to y=2 is 1). So dx[v] must be 0. So v is x (node 1). So the parent of y in the tree (from x's perspective) is x. But from y's BFS tree perspective, the parent of x is y, which must have dy[x] = 1 (distance from y to x is 1). So dy[x] -1 is 0, so the parent must be a node with dy[v] = 0, which is y itself. But that's impossible. So how does this work?

Wait, in the tree, the parent of x from y's perspective is y. But x is a node in the tree. So how can that be? Because x is the root in the BFS tree for x, and y is the root in the BFS tree for y. So in the tree, the path between x and y is a single edge. Because in the sample input, x=1 and y=2 are connected by an edge. So in the tree, the edge 1-2 must be present. Then, from x's BFS tree, the parent of 2 is 1. From y's BFS tree, the parent of 1 is 2. So the same edge is part of the tree and satisfies both conditions. Because for the edge (1,2), dx[1] =0, dx[2]=1. dy[1]=1, dy[2]=0.

So for node 2 (y), in the tree, the parent from x's perspective is 1. For node 1 (x), the parent from y's perspective is 2. But in the tree, each node has exactly one parent. So how can this be?

Ah! Because the tree is undirected, but the BFS trees are directed. So the parent relationships are different depending on the root. However, the tree structure is undirected. So when considering the BFS tree for x, the edges are directed from parent to child (away from x). When considering the BFS tree for y, the edges are directed from parent to child (away from y). But the underlying undirected tree is the same.

But in this case, the tree includes the edge between 1 and 2. So from x's perspective, 2's parent is 1. From y's perspective, 1's parent is 2. But in the undirected tree, the edge is bidirectional. So the parent assignments for different roots are allowed. So the tree structure is compatible with both BFS trees.

But how does this fit into our previous conditions? Because for node 2 (y), in the BFS tree for x, the parent is 1. Which satisfies dx[1] = dx[2] -1 (0 = 1-1). And for the BFS tree for y, the parent of 1 is 2, which satisfies dy[2] = dy[1] -1. Because dy[1] (distance from y to 1) is 1, so dy[1] -1 is 0, which is dy[2] (distance from y to 2 is 0). So yes. So for node 1 (x), in the BFS tree for y, its parent is 2. For node 2 (y), in the BFS tree for x, its parent is 1. But these are the same edge in the undirected tree.

So our earlier approach, which considers all nodes except x and y, is incomplete. Because x and y are also nodes in the tree and must have parents in their respective BFS trees. But how?

Wait, the BFS tree for x is rooted at x, so x has no parent. Similarly, the BFS tree for y is rooted at y, so y has no parent. But in the undirected tree, x and y are connected via an edge, which in x's BFS tree is directed x → y, and in y's BFS tree is directed y → x. So the parents for x and y are different for the two BFS trees. But in the undirected tree, the edge is present, and each node's parent is determined by the BFS tree's root.

So, in our approach, when x and y are different, the parents of x and y are not considered in the product. Because x's parent in the BFS tree for x is none, and y's parent in the BFS tree for y is none. However, in the tree, x and y must be connected via a path. So for x and y to have a valid tree, the edge between them must be part of the tree if and only if they are adjacent. But in the general case, they can be connected via other nodes.

But how does this fit into our earlier conditions?

Ah, the edge between x and y is part of the tree only if dx[y] is 1 (since x's BFS tree requires that the parent of y is x, which is dx[y]-1 = 0. So dx[y] must be 1. Similarly, dy[x] must be 1. So dx[y] is 1, which implies that x and y are adjacent in the graph. So for x and y to have a valid tree when they are different, they must be adjacent (dx[y] = 1). But looking at the sample input, in the first example, x=1 and y=2 are adjacent, and their f(x,y) is 1. Another sample: in the second input, for example, the first line of the output is 1 followed by zeros. So when x and y are not adjacent, f(x,y) is zero.

So the only way that x and y (different) can have a non-zero f(x,y) is if dx[y] = 1. Because then, the edge x-y is present in the graph, and it can be part of the tree, allowing y's parent in x's BFS tree to be x, and x's parent in y's BFS tree to be y. But how does this fit into our parent conditions?

Wait, the parent conditions are only for nodes other than x and y. Because x and y are roots for their respective BFS trees. So, for node y (in x's BFS tree), its parent must be a node with dx[v] = dx[y] -1 = 0. Which is x. So the edge x-y must be present in the tree. Similarly, for node x (in y's BFS tree), its parent must be a node with dy[v] = dy[x] -1 = 0 (since dy[x] is 1). So the parent is y. So the edge x-y must be present in the tree.

Thus, the edge x-y must be present in the tree. So for x and y to have any valid trees, they must be adjacent (dx[y] = 1). Otherwise, f(x,y) is zero.

So the updated approach is:

For each x and y:

If x == y:

   Compute dx (same as dy) via BFS.

   For all nodes u != x, count the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1. The product of these counts is the answer.

Else:

   Compute dx and dy via BFS.

   Check if dx[y] != 1. If so, answer is 0.

   Else:

      For all nodes u except x and y:

         Compute the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1. Multiply these counts. If any count is zero, answer is zero.

      Additionally, check that the edge x-y exists. Because for x and y to have their parents in each other's BFS trees, the edge must be present. So the product must include the edge x-y.

Wait, but wait. If x and y are different and dx[y] = 1, then the edge x-y exists in the graph. So the count for the edge x-y is present.

But in the product for x and y, the nodes x and y are not considered (since the product is for u other than x and y). However, for the edge x-y to be part of the tree, the tree must include this edge. Because otherwise, the path from x to y in the tree would be longer than 1, which contradicts dx[y] = 1.

But in the product approach, the edge x-y is included in the tree if and only if the parents of y (from x's perspective) is x, and the parents of x (from y's perspective) is y. But how is this enforced in the product approach?

In the case where x and y are different and dx[y] = 1:

For node y (which is not x), the parent in the tree must be a node v where dx[v] = dx[y] -1 = 0 (since dx[y] =1) and dy[v] = dy[y] -1 = -1. But dy[y] is 0, so dy[v] must be -1, which is impossible. So according to the earlier approach, this would make the count for node y's parent zero, leading to the total product being zero.

But this contradicts the sample input where x=1 and y=2 have a non-zero f(x,y). So clearly, there's a flaw in the approach.

Ah, right! Because in the earlier approach, for the case when x and y are different, all nodes except x and y are considered. But node y is part of the nodes to be considered. For example, when x=1 and y=2, the nodes to be considered are 3 and 4 and 2. Wait, no: according to the problem statement, for each pair (x,y), we have to process all nodes except x and y. Or wait, no:

Wait, in the case when x and y are different, the nodes considered are all u except x and y. Because x and y are roots for their BFS trees, so their parents are none. So in the product, we only multiply the counts for u not equal to x or y.

So in the case when x=1 and y=2:

- u=2 is y, so not considered.

- u=3: dx[3] =2, dy[3] =1. So parent must be dx=1, dy=0. Which is node 2. So count is 1 (edge 2-3).

- u=4: dx[4]=1, dy[4]=2. Parent must be dx=0 (node 1) and dy=1. Node 1 has dy=1 (distance from y=2 to x=1 is 1). So the edge 1-4 exists, so count is 1.

- u=1: not considered.

So the product is 1 (for u=3) * 1 (for u=4) = 1. So this matches the sample.

But what about node y=2? Since it's excluded from the product, but in the tree, its parent in x's BFS tree is x=1, which is dx[y]-1 =0. So the edge x-y must be present. But how is this enforced in the product approach?

Ah, because in the product approach, the parent of y is x. But since y is excluded from the product, the edge x-y must be part of the tree. But how is this checked?

Because if the edge x-y is not in the graph, then dx[y] would be 1 only if there's a path of length 1 from x to y. But if the edge is not present, dx[y] would be larger than 1. So in the case when x and y are different, the first check is to see if dx[y] is 1. If not, f(x,y) is zero. If it is 1, then the edge x-y must be present. Because dx[y] is computed via BFS on the original graph. So dx[y] =1 implies that there's an edge between x and y in the graph.

So in the product approach, when x and y are different and dx[y] =1, the edge x-y exists. So the parent of y (from x's BFS tree) is x. Which is valid, and the parent of x (from y's BFS tree) is y, which is also valid.

But since u= y is not considered in the product, and the edge x-y is present in the graph (since dx[y] =1), the edge is part of the tree. So the product approach correctly captures this.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For each pair (x, y):

If x == y:

   Compute the BFS tree for x. For each node u != x, count the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1. The product of these counts is the answer.

Else:

   Compute dx and dy via BFS.

   If dx[y] != 1, then answer is 0.

   Else:

      For each node u != x and u != y:

         count the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u] -1 and dy[v] = dy[u] -1.

      The product of all these counts is the answer. If any count is zero, the product is zero.

So this is the correct approach.

Now, the steps for the code:

1. Precompute for all pairs (x, y) the BFS distances dx and dy.

But n is up to 400. So for each x, we can precompute dx for all nodes. Then, for each x and y, we have to compute for each node u, the counts.

The problem requires n^2 pairs (x,y). For each pair, we need to do:

- For x==y: compute the product of the counts of possible parents (each node u !=x: number of neighbors v with dx[v] = dx[u] -1).

- For x != y:

   Check if dx[y] (from x) is 1. If not, answer is zero.

   Else, compute dy (from y) via BFS.

   For each u !=x and u !=y:

      count the number of neighbors v where dx[v] = dx[u]-1 and dy[v] = dy[u]-1.

   Multiply all counts.

So the steps are:

Precompute for each x, the distances dx.

Then, for each x and y:

   if x == y:

      ans is product for each u !=x of (number of neighbors v with dx[x][v] = dx[x][u] -1).

   else:

      compute dx = dx[x][...], dy = dx[y][...].

      if dx[y] !=1 → ans is 0.

      else:

         for all u !=x and u !=y:

             count the number of v in u's neighbors where dx[v] == dx[u]-1 and dy[v] == dy[u]-1.

         product of these counts.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows.

First, precompute the distance tables:

- For each x, perform BFS and store the distances to all other nodes.

This is O(n * (n + m)), which for n=400 and m=600 is 400*(1000) = 400,000 steps. Which is acceptable.

Then, for each pair (x,y):

   if x == y:

      compute product for u !=x of the count.

   else:

      compute dx = dist[x], dy = dist[y].

      if dx[y] != 1 → ans is 0.

      else:

         for each u not in {x,y}, compute count of v in adj[u] where dx[v] == dx[u]-1 and dy[v] == dy[u]-1.

         product of counts.

Now, the problem is to compute this efficiently.

The main steps are:

- Precompute the distance tables.

- Precompute for each x, the adjacency list.

Implementing BFS for each x is manageable.

Now, let's think about the code.

Implementing BFS for each x:

We can represent the graph as an adjacency list. For each x, run BFS and store the distances.

So in Python:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)] # nodes are 1-based

for _ in range(m):

   a, b = map(int, input().split())

   adj[a].append(b)

   adj[b].append(a)

# Precompute distance for each x.

dist = [ [0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1) ]

from collections import deque

for x in range(1, n+1):

   q = deque()

   q.append(x)

   d = [ -1 ] * (n+1 )

   d[x] =0

   while q:

      u = q.popleft()

      for v in adj[u]:

          if d[v] == -1:

              d[v] = d[u] +1

              q.append(v)

   for u in range(1, n+1):

      dist[x][u] = d[u]

Then, for each x and y:

if x == y:

   res = 1

   for u in range(1, n+1):

      if u ==x:

          continue

      cnt =0

      current_d = dist[x][u]

      for v in adj[u]:

          if dist[x][v] == current_d -1:

              cnt +=1

      if cnt ==0:

          res =0

          break

      res = res * cnt % 998244353

   # Store this res in the output matrix.

else:

   dx = dist[x]

   dy = dist[y]

   if dx[y] !=1:

       res =0

   else:

       res =1

       for u in range(1, n+1):

           if u ==x or u ==y:

               continue

           current_dx = dx[u]

           current_dy = dy[u]

           required_dx = current_dx -1

           required_dy = current_dy -1

           cnt =0

           for v in adj[u]:

               if dx[v] == required_dx and dy[v] == required_dy:

                   cnt +=1

           if cnt ==0:

               res =0

               break

           res = res * cnt % 998244353

   # Store this res in the output matrix.

But this is O(n^3) in the worst case, because for each of the O(n^2) pairs (x,y), for x != y, we loop through O(n) nodes, each with O(k) adj nodes (k up to m/n). For n=400, n^3 is 64 million. Which could be tight for Python in 2.5 seconds. So we need to optimize.

Hmm, but for each pair (x,y) where x != y, the inner loops can take up to 400 * 400 (since for each u, we loop through its adj list). But with n=400, and m=600, the average number of edges per node is 3. So for each u, the inner loop is O(3) steps, leading to 400 * 3 = 1200 steps per (x,y) pair. For 400*400 = 160,000 pairs, that's 160,000 * 1200 = 192,000,000 operations. Which is way too much for Python to handle in 2.5 seconds (since Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second).

This will not pass the time constraints. So we need to find a way to optimize this.

How can we optimize?

The key is to precompute for all x and u, the list of nodes v that are neighbors of u and have dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1. This way, when x and y are the same, we can quickly look up the count for each u.

Similarly, for the case when x and y are different, we can precompute for each x and y, and for each u, the count of neighbors v where dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1 and dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1.

But precomputing this for all possible x, y, u is O(n^3) space, which for n=400 is 400^3 = 64 million entries. Which is manageable in Python, but might be tight.

Alternatively, for each u, precompute a dictionary that maps (dx, dy) to the count of neighbors v that have those dx and dy values.

But this seems tricky. Alternatively, for each u, and for each possible x and y, precompute the count of v in adj[u] where dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1 and dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1. But this would require O(n^2) storage per u, leading to O(n^3) total storage, which is 64 million for n=400. Not feasible.

Alternative approach: for each pair x and y, precompute the required counts for all u in O(1) per u.

Wait, but even if we precompute for each x and u, a list of possible parents (v in adj[u] with dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1), then for the case where x and y are different, for each u, the count is the number of v in this list that also have dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1.

So for each x, precompute for each u a list of possible parents (v in adj[u] with dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1). Then, for a pair (x,y), the count for u is the number of v in this list where dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1.

This way, the precomputation for x can be done once per x, and then for each y, when processing pairs (x,y), we can quickly compute the required count for u.

This would reduce the time for the x != y case by precomputing the possible parents for each x and u.

So, let's precompute for each x and u, the list of parents candidates (v in adj[u] with dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1).

This can be done once for each x, and for each u.

Thus, the precomputation step would be:

pre_parents = [ [ [] for _ in range(n+1) ] for _ in range(n+1) ]

for x in 1..n:

   for u in 1..n:

      pre_parents[x][u] = [v for v in adj[u] if dist[x][v] == dist[x][u] -1]

But this is O(n^2 * average adj size), which for n=400 and adj size 3, is 400*400*3 = 480,000 operations. Which is acceptable.

Then, when processing a pair (x,y) where x != y:

For each u !=x and !=y:

   required_dy = dy[u] -1

   count = number of v in pre_parents[x][u] where dist[y][v] == required_dy.

This can be computed by iterating through the list pre_parents[x][u] and checking dist[y][v] for each v.

But this is again O(n) per pair (x,y), leading to O(n^3) operations. Which is 400^3 = 64 million. But with Python's speed, this might not be feasible.

Alternative idea: precompute for each x and u, a dictionary that maps the required dy to the count. So for each x, u, and possible dy value, how many parents v of u (from x's perspective) have dist[y][v] == required_dy. But this is not feasible due to the high number of possible dy values.

Alternative approach: when x and y are different, and dx[y] is 1, then for each u, the required dy[v] is dy[u] -1. Which depends on y's BFS distances.

But since we have to compute the count for each pair (x,y), perhaps we can't precompute this.

Thus, the only way to speed this up is to precompute for each x, the possible parents for each u, and then for each pair (x,y), when x != y, compute the required count for each u by iterating over the pre_parents[x][u] list and checking if their dy[v] is dy[u]-1. This is O(1) per parent candidate.

But how many parent candidates are there? For each u, the pre_parents[x][u] is a list of all v in adj[u] that are one step closer to x. For a tree, this is 1. For a general graph, it can be more. But on average, perhaps it's manageable.

In the worst case, for each u, pre_parents[x][u] could have O(m) entries, but in reality, since the graph is undirected and we're considering BFS layers, it's unlikely. For example, for a node u in the first BFS layer of x, pre_parents[x][u] is just x. For nodes in higher layers, it's the nodes in the previous layer.

But in a dense graph, a node u may have many parents in the BFS layers.

But even with that, for each pair (x,y), and for each u, looping through pre_parents[x][u] and checking if v's dy is dy[u]-1 is O(k) operations, where k is the length of pre_parents[x][u].

But for 400x400 pairs, and for each u, average k of say 3, this is 400 * 400 * 400 * 3 = 192 million operations. Which is way too slow.

Thus, we need a better approach.

Alternative idea: for each pair (x,y) where x != y and dx[y] = 1, compute for each u the required condition: dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1. Which can be rewritten as dist[y][v] +1 = dist[y][u].

Thus, for each u, the number of parents v (from x's perspective) that also are parents in y's BFS tree.

So for each u, the count is the intersection of the pre_parents[x][u] list and the pre_parents[y][u] list.

But how?

Because pre_parents[x][u] is the list of v's that are one step closer to x, and pre_parents[y][u] is the list of v's that are one step closer to y.

But the required condition for v in x's parent list and in y's parent list for u.

Wait, no. For the case when x and y are different and dx[y] is 1, the required condition for v is:

v is in pre_parents[x][u], and v is in pre_parents[y][u] if the required dy[v] is dy[u] -1.

Wait, no. The required dy[v] is dy[u] -1, which is equivalent to v being in the pre_parents[y][u] (since dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1).

Thus, the count is the number of v in pre_parents[x][u] that are also in pre_parents[y][u].

So for each u, the count is the size of the intersection of pre_parents[x][u] and pre_parents[y][u].

But how to compute this quickly.

If we precompute for each x and u, the set of parents, then for each y, we can compute the intersection between pre_parents[x][u] and pre_parents[y][u] by set intersections. But converting lists to sets for every u and every x would take too much memory.

Alternative idea: for each x and u, store the parents in a sorted list, and then for y and u, binary search for elements in pre_parents[x][u] that are in pre_parents[y][u]. But this would be O(k log l) per u, which might not help.

Alternatively, for each pair (x, y), precompute a 2D array where for each u, the count is the number of common elements in pre_parents[x][u] and pre_parents[y][u], but this is not feasible.

Alternative approach: precompute for each x, a dictionary for each u that maps the node v to the count. Then, for y, when we need to count the number of v in pre_parents[x][u] that are also in pre_parents[y][u], we can loop through pre_parents[x][u] and check if v is in pre_parents[y][u]. But this requires O(k) time per u, where k is the length of pre_parents[x][u].

But even this may be too slow.

Alternatively, we can precompute for each u and v, the set of x's for which v is a parent of u in x's BFS tree. But this is O(n^3) storage, which is not feasible.

Hmm. This is a challenging problem.

Let me think about the first sample input. For x=1 and y=2:

pre_parents[x=1][u=3] is [2], because in the BFS tree for x=1, the parents of 3 are nodes in the previous layer (dx=2-1=1). So nodes with dx=1 connected to 3. In the graph, node 2 is connected to 3 and has dx=1.

pre_parents[y=2][u=3] is [2], because dy[u=3] is 1, so required dy[v] is 0. Only node 2 has dy=0. So the intersection is [2], count is 1.

For u=4, pre_parents[x=1][4] is [1, 3, 4's neighbors with dx=0. dx[4] is 1. So pre_parents[x=1][4] is [1], since 1's dx is 0, and 4's dx is 1. Other neighbors of 4 are 3 (dx=2) and 1 (dx=0). So pre_parents[x=1][4] is [1].

pre_parents[y=2][u=4] is dy[u=4] is 2. So required dy[v] is 1. The neighbors of 4 are 1,3. dy[1] is 1 (distance from y=2 to 1 is 1). dy[3] is 1 (distance from 2 to 3 is 1). So pre_parents[y=2][4] is [1,3]. But in the original graph, 4 is connected to 1 and 3. So pre_parents[y=2][4] is [1,3].

But in the x=1 case, pre_parents[x=1][4] is [1]. So the intersection is [1], count is 1.

So for u=4, the count is 1.

Thus, the product is 1*1 = 1.

So in this case, the algorithm works.

But how to make this efficient in code?

Perhaps in Python, using sets for pre_parents[x][u] can speed up lookups. So for each x and u, pre_parents[x][u] is a set. Then, for a given y, for each u, the count is the number of elements in pre_parents[x][u] that are also in pre_parents[y][u -1].

Wait, no. pre_parents[y][u] is the set of v's that are one step closer to y for u. But we need v's that are in pre_parents[x][u] (one step closer to x) and in pre_parents[y][u] (one step closer to y). So the count is the size of the intersection of pre_parents[x][u] and pre_parents[y][u].

Wait, no. The required condition for v is that dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1 and dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1.

But pre_parents[x][u] is the set of v where dist[x][v] = dist[x][u] -1.

pre_parents[y][u] is the set of v where dist[y][v] = dist[y][u] -1.

So the required v's are the intersection of these two sets.

Thus, for each u, the count is the size of the intersection of pre_parents[x][u] and pre_parents[y][u].

Thus, if we precompute for each x and u, the parents as a set, then for a pair (x,y), the count for u is len( pre_parents[x][u] & pre_parents[y][u] ), which is the size of the intersection of the two sets.

Thus, the code can be modified as:

pre_parents_set = [ [ set() for _ in range(n+1) ] for _ in range(n+1) ]

for x in range(1, n+1):

   for u in range(1, n+1):

      pre_parents_set[x][u] = { v for v in adj[u] if dist[x][v] == dist[x][u] -1 }

Then, for x != y:

   if dx[y] !=1:

      res=0

   else:

      res=1

      for u in 1..n:

          if u ==x or u ==y:

              continue

          common = len( pre_parents_set[x][u] & pre_parents_set[y][u] )

          if common ==0:

              res=0

              break

          res = res * common % MOD

But storing pre_parents_set as sets for all x and u is possible. For n=400, each set for x and u would take O(k) space. But with 400x400=160,000 sets and each set averaging say 3 elements, this is manageable.

Then, the intersection can be computed quickly using Python's set operations.

In Python, the time complexity for set intersections is O(min(len(a), len(b))), which is acceptable for small sets.

This should significantly speed up the code, as the intersection operations are now O(1) average case for small sets.

So the code steps are:

1. Precompute dist for each x.

2. Precompute pre_parents_set for each x and u.

3. For each pair (x,y):

   if x == y:

      product of len(pre_parents_set[x][u]) for u !=x.

   else:

      if dist[x][y] !=1 → 0.

      else:

         product of len( pre_parents_set[x][u] & pre_parents_set[y][u] ) for u not in {x,y}.

Thus, this approach should be manageable.

Now, let's implement this.

But in Python, using set intersections for 400x400 pairs with 400 nodes each may still be time-consuming. So further optimizations can be considered.

Another optimization: precompute for each x, a dictionary where for each u, the list of parents is stored as a sorted list. Then, for y, we can precompute for each u, the list of parents in y's BFS tree. Then, compute the intersection as the sorted lists merged. But this would require sorting each list, which may not be worth the time.

But perhaps using bitmask representation for parents. For example, for each x and u, represent the parents as a bitmask (if the number of nodes is up to 400, each bitmask would require 400 bits, which is 50 bytes per entry). This is not feasible.

Alternative idea: precompute for each x and u, a list of parents. For each x and u, store the parents in a list, and precompute a dictionary that maps a node v to whether it is present in the parents list. Then, for y, check for each v in x's parents list for u whether v is in y's parents list for u.

But this would require for each x and u, a dictionary of presence. This would take O(n^3) memory, which is 400^3 = 64 million entries, which is too much.

Thus, the best approach is to proceed with the initial idea of using sets.

Now, let's proceed to code.

But in Python, building the pre_parents_set for all x and u may take some time, but is manageable.

Sample Input 2:

8 9
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 7
3 5
3 6
4 8
2 3
3 4

The output shows that for x=1, y=2, the answer is 0. Because dx[y] is 1, but for u=7, which is a neighbor of 2, pre_parents_set[1][7] is 2 (since dx[7] is 2, so parents must be nodes with dx=1. These are 2 and any other node with dx=1 and connected to 7. But in the graph, 2 is connected to 7, and dx[2] is 1. So pre_parents_set[1][7] = {2}. For y=2, dy[7] is 0. So pre_parents_set[2][7] is {2} (since dy[7] is 0, so no parents. So for u=7 (which is not x or y), pre_parents_set[x=1][7] is {2}, pre_parents_set[y=2][7] is empty. So common is empty, cnt=0 → product is zero. Thus, ans[1][2] is zero.

Thus, the code should correctly compute this.

Thus, the code should work.
