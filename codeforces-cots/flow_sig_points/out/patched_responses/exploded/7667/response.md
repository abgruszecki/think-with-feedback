Okay, let's see. We need to solve this problem where for each x from 1 to n, we have to compute the number of ways to reach x by making moves following certain divisibility rules. The moves must be such that the first move's length is divisible by k, the second by k+1, and so on. Also, each way is considered different if the set of visited positions differs. Hmm.

So the problem is to compute for each x in [1, n], the number of distinct paths that end at x, where each step's length meets the divisibility condition. The answer has to be modulo 998244353.

First, let's think about the constraints. The maximum n is 2e5. So any O(n^2) solution is probably going to be too slow. We need an O(n) or O(n log n) approach.

Let me try to model this. Let's think of the steps. Each step i (starting from 0) must be divisible by k + i. The first step is step 0, divisible by k. So the first move can be any multiple of k. Then the next step (step 1) must be a multiple of k+1, and so on.

But each move's length is a positive integer. So each step adds a positive multiple of the required divisor. But how do the steps add up to x?

Wait, the problem states that each move is a positive integer. So the steps are additive. For example, if the first move is a multiple of k, then the total after first move is s_1 = a_1 * k. The next move is a_2*(k+1), etc. Each a_i is a positive integer. So the total sum after m steps is sum_{i=0 to m-1} a_i * (k+i), where each a_i >=1.

But the problem is to find for each x, the number of ways to reach x by any number of steps. Each way is a sequence of steps (could be any number of steps) such that their sum is exactly x, and each step's divisor condition is met. Also, the paths are considered different if the set of visited positions is different. So the order of steps matters in the sense that the intermediate points must differ. Wait, no. Because the problem says "differ as sets of visited positions". Wait, no, the example shows that the order of steps affects the path. For example, in the first sample, x=3 can be reached via [0,1,3] or [0,3]. So different sequences of steps that result in different sets of positions are considered different.

Wait, the problem statement says: "Two ways are considered different if they differ as sets of visited positions." Wait, but the moves are steps adding to the position, so the set of visited positions is the sequence of positions after each move. So for example, if you take two moves, the positions are 0, s1, s1+s2. So the set is {0, s1, s1+s2}.

So two different sequences of steps that result in the same final position but different intermediate positions (different s1, same s1+s2) are considered different. For example, if x=4, and the first move is 2 (k=2), then the second step is 2 (divisible by 3? No. Because k was 2, first step is divisible by 2, second step by 3. So for example, first step 4 (div by 2), then step 3 (div by 3), sum 7. So the set is {0,4,7}. But if you take a first step of 2 (div by 2), then a step of 5 (div by 3?), 5 is 5, which is not divisible by 3. So that's invalid. So the steps must be multiples of the required divisors.

Wait, the first move is step 0, divisible by k. Then step 1 (the second move) must be divisible by k+1. So each step's length is a positive multiple of (k + i) for the i-th step (0-based).

So each move's length is a positive multiple of (k + i) for the i-th step. So the problem is to find all possible sequences of steps where each step's length is a multiple of its required divisor, such that the sum is exactly x. And each such sequence contributes a unique set of visited positions (the cumulative sums), so the count is the number of such sequences for each x.

But how to model this. Let's think recursively. For each x, the ways to reach x can be computed by considering all possible last steps. The last step must be the m-th step (for some m), which is a multiple of (k + m-1). Wait, let's think: the first step is step 0 (m=0?), no. Let me think again. The first move is the first step. So for the first move, it's step 0, divisor is k. The second move is step 1, divisor k+1, etc. So for the m-th move (the m-th step), the divisor is k + m-1. Because the first step is m=1? Or is the step index starting at 0? Let me recheck the example.

In the example given, when k=2, the steps are:

0 →4 (step length 4, divisible by k=2).

4 →7 (step 3, divisible by 3).

7 →19 (step 12, divisible by 4).

19 →44 (step 25, divisible by 5).

So the first step (move 1) is divisible by k=2. The second step (move 2) is divisible by 3=k+1. Third move is divisible by 4=k+2, etc. So the i-th move (starting from 1) must be divisible by k + (i-1). So for m moves, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k + m-1.

So the sum of the steps is x. So for each x, we need to find all possible m (number of steps) and sequences of divisors such that the sum of the steps (each being a positive multiple of their divisor) equals x.

But how to model the possible combinations. Let's think of dynamic programming. Let dp[x] be the number of ways to reach x. Then, for each x, we can compute dp[x] by adding contributions from previous steps. For example, for x, the last step could be a multiple of d, where d is k + (m-1) for some m. But since m can vary, perhaps we need to track for each possible step m, the divisors up to that point.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let's think of the problem differently. Let's note that each possible sequence of steps corresponds to a set of divisors: the first step's divisor is k, the second k+1, etc. So for each possible m (number of steps), the sum of the steps must be x, and each step is at least the divisor (since it's a positive multiple: 1*d, 2*d, etc. So each step is at least d, which is k + i-1 for the i-th step (1-based? Wait, for the first step, divisor is k. For the i-th step, divisor is k + (i-1). So for m steps, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k+m-1. So the sum of the divisors is the minimal sum possible for m steps: sum_{i=0 to m-1} (k + i) = sum from k to k+m-1. Which is (m*(2k + m-1))/2. So for m steps, the minimal sum is S_m = m*(2k + m -1)/2.

If x is less than S_m, then it's impossible to reach x with m steps. So for each x, the possible m's are those where S_m ≤ x.

But for a given x, the maximum possible m is such that S_m ≤x. Let's find m_max for x. For example, if x is fixed, we can find the maximum m where S_m ≤x. Because for m steps, the minimal sum is S_m. So for x to be reachable with m steps, x must be >= S_m. Also, each step can be larger than the divisor. So the sum can be S_m plus some increments. But how to model this.

Alternatively, for a given m, the sum of the steps is x, which is equal to sum_{i=0 to m-1} ( (k+i) * a_i ), where a_i >=1. So the sum can be written as sum (k+i) * a_i = sum (k+i) * (1 + b_i ), where b_i >=0. Then, sum (k+i) * 1 + sum (k+i) * b_i = S_m + sum (k+i) * b_i. So x must be equal to S_m + sum (k+i) * b_i.

So the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of m's such that x >= S_m, and x - S_m can be written as a sum of multiples of (k + i) for i=0 to m-1. But how?

Wait, but each (k+i) is a divisor for the (i+1)-th step. Wait, perhaps this is leading us astray. Let's think of the problem as for each possible number of steps m, the sum x must be at least S_m (the minimal sum for m steps), and the remaining x - S_m must be partitioned into any number of multiples of the divisors (since each step can contribute (a_i -1) * (k+i) in the sum). So x - S_m is equal to sum_{i=0 to m-1} ( (a_i -1) * (k + i) ). Since a_i >=1, (a_i-1) can be 0 or higher.

But this sum is the sum over all (k+i) multiplied by non-negative integers. So x - S_m must be a non-negative integer, and the problem reduces to the number of ways to distribute (x - S_m) into m terms, where each term is a non-negative multiple of (k + i). Wait, no. Because each term (a_i -1) is multiplied by (k+i). So for the sum x - S_m = sum ( (a_i -1) * (k + i) ), which can be any combination of (k+i) factors. But this is equivalent to x - S_m can be written as any combination of the (k+i) terms, multiplied by any non-negative integer. So each (a_i -1) can be any non-negative integer.

But how does that affect the count? For each possible m where S_m <=x, and x - S_m >=0, the number of ways is the number of sequences of m steps where each step's divisor is k+i (for i from 0 to m-1), and the sum of their (a_i -1) * (k+i) is x - S_m. But since each (a_i -1) can be any non-negative integer, the sum x - S_m can be formed by adding any multiples of the (k+i) terms. So the number of ways for a given m is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to sum_{i=0 to m-1} (c_i * (k+i)) = x - S_m, where c_i >=0. Each c_i is (a_i -1).

But how many such solutions are there? For example, if x - S_m is zero, there's exactly one solution (all c_i =0). If x - S_m is D, then the number of solutions is the number of ways to write D as a sum of multiples of the divisors (k, k+1, ..., k+m-1), where each term is a multiple of its respective divisor.

Wait, but the problem here is that each term in the sum is a multiple of its divisor. So for each divisor d_i =k +i, the contribution to the sum is a multiple of d_i. So the sum is the sum of multiples of various divisors. The number of ways to do this is equivalent to the number of combinations of the divisors (with possible repeats) that sum to D, but each term must be a multiple of their respective d_i.

But this seems complicated. However, notice that the order of the steps matters in the sense that each c_i is associated with a specific d_i. However, the way to split D into these multiples is additive. But how to count this.

But here's a key insight: each term c_i * d_i is a non-negative integer. So the sum over all such terms must equal D. The number of ways to do this is equal to the product of (the number of choices for each c_i) such that their sum is D. But this is a standard problem in dynamic programming. However, given that the divisors d_i can be up to k + m-1, and m can be up to O(sqrt(2x)), this could be tricky.

Wait, but for the problem, since n is up to 2e5, and we need to compute for all x up to n, perhaps there's a way to model this with generating functions. Let's think in terms of generating functions.

For each possible m, the sum S_m must be <=n, and the remaining D =x - S_m must be >=0. For each m, the generating function for the possible D is the product of generating functions for each divisor d_i (k, k+1, ..., k+m-1), where each d_i's generating function is 1 + x^{d_i} + x^{2d_i} + ... = 1/(1 - x^{d_i}).

So for each m, the generating function for the possible D is the product of 1/(1 - x^{d_i}) for i=0 to m-1 (d_i =k+i). Then, for a given x, the total number of ways is the sum over all m where S_m <=x, of the coefficient of x^{D} (where D = x - S_m) in the generating function for that m.

But calculating these coefficients for all x up to n and all m up to some maximum is computationally challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming. Let's think of building a DP array where dp[x] is the sum over all m such that S_m <=x and the contribution from m steps to x.

But how to efficiently compute this.

Another approach: for each m, the minimal sum is S_m. Then, all x >= S_m can be written as S_m + D, where D >=0. The number of ways for x is the sum over all possible m where S_m <=x of the number of ways to write D =x -S_m as the sum of multiples of d_i =k, k+1, ...,k+m-1.

But the problem is that for each x, you need to consider all possible m that could contribute to x, which could be up to O(sqrt(2x)) possible m's (since S_m is about m^2/2 for large m). But for n up to 2e5, m_max would be up to around 2e5, which is too big.

Wait, but S_m is the sum of the first m terms starting at k. So S_m = m*(k + (k +m-1 -1 )) / 2 = m*(2k + m-1)/2. So solving for m when S_m <=x. For x up to 2e5, m can be up to O(sqrt(2x)), but that's around 632 for x=2e5. So for each x, the number of possible m's is O(sqrt(x)), which is manageable. So for n=2e5, per x, we can iterate m up to O(632) steps. That would be acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Precompute for each possible m, the minimal sum S_m. For m where S_m >n, we can ignore.

- For each x from 1 to n, iterate over all possible m such that S_m <=x. For each such m, compute D=x - S_m. The contribution to x is the number of ways to represent D as the sum of multiples of the divisors d_0=k, d_1=k+1, ..., d_{m-1}=k+m-1. Each multiple can be zero or more times.

But how to compute the number of ways for each m and D?

This seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming. Let's model this for each m. For a given m, the divisors are k, k+1, ...,k+m-1. The generating function for these divisors is (1/(1-x^k)) * (1/(1-x^{k+1})) * ... * (1/(1-x^{k+m-1})). The coefficient of x^D in this product gives the number of ways for that m.

But computing this for all m and D up to 2e5 is computationally heavy. However, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where for each m, we process the divisors in order and update the DP array.

Let's think of the following approach:

We can precompute for all possible m, and for each possible D, the number of ways for that m and D. Then, for each x, we sum over all m where S_m <=x the ways for m and D=x-S_m.

But precomputing for all m up to O(632) and D up to 2e5 is feasible.

Wait, but how? For each m, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k+m-1. So when m increases by 1, the next divisor is k + m (since m starts at 1, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k+m-1 for m steps). So for each m, the set of divisors is the set for m-1 plus k+m-1. So we can model this incrementally.

So the idea is:

- For each possible m (starting from 1 upwards), compute the minimal sum S_m. If S_m >n, break.

- For each m, the divisors are the first m divisors starting at k. So when processing m, the new divisor is k + m -1.

- We can maintain a dynamic programming array that tracks the number of ways to form D for each m. For m=1, D can be 0, 1*k, 2*k, etc. Wait, no. For m=1, the sum is S_1 = k*1 (since each step must be at least 1*d_i, so sum for m=1 is k*1). Then D is x - S_1. The number of ways is the number of ways to write D as multiples of k. So D must be a multiple of k, and the number of ways is 1 (since each multiple can be written in exactly one way as (a_1-1)*k, where a_1-1 is D/k).

Wait, for m=1, the sum after step 1 is S_1 =k*1. Then, x = S_1 + D. So D can be any non-negative multiple of k, since the first step's a_1 can be 1 + D/k.

So for example, x =k: D=0 →1 way. x=2k: D=k →1 way (a_1=2). So for m=1, the contribution to x is 1 if x is >=k and x -k is a multiple of k. But wait, x - S_1 = x -k must be a multiple of k. So x must be congruent to 0 mod k. So x =k*(1 + t), where t >=0. For each such x, the contribution from m=1 is 1.

But how to model this for general m.

The key idea here is that for each m, the possible D must be a sum of multiples of the divisors. But each divisor d_i (k, k+1, ...,k+m-1) can be used any number of times (since each c_i is a non-negative integer). So the number of ways is the number of combinations of non-negative integers c_0, c_1, ..., c_{m-1} such that sum c_i *d_i =D.

This is similar to the classic unbounded knapsack problem, but with multiple constraints (each item can be used any number of times, but each 'item' here is a divisor d_i, and each 'use' adds d_i to the sum). But the problem is that for each m, the available divisors are different, and for each x, we need to consider all possible m's.

But since the constraints are up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute for each possible m, the possible D values and their count, then accumulate for each x the sum over m.

But even that seems challenging. Let's think of the dynamic programming approach. Let's create a 2D array where dp[m][D] is the number of ways to form D using the first m divisors. But for m up to 632 and D up to 2e5, this would be 632 * 2e5 = 1.26e8 operations, which may be manageable. But in Python, this might be tight on memory and time.

Alternatively, we can optimize using a 1D array, updating it for each m. Let's think of it this way:

For each m, we process the divisors in order. The initial DP for m=0 is D=0 with 1 way. For m=1, the divisor is k. For each D, the number of ways is the sum of ways to reach D - t*k for t >=0. So the generating function is the convolution with the previous DP. But using a 1D array, we can process each divisor and update the DP as follows:

Initialize a DP array where dp[D] is the number of ways to form D with the divisors processed so far.

For each new divisor d in the current m's divisors:

   for D from d to n:

       dp[D] = (dp[D] + dp[D -d]) % MOD

But this is the standard unbounded knapsack approach, but for each new divisor d, the current DP is updated by adding all multiples of d. However, for each m, the set of divisors is k, k+1, ...,k+m-1. So when m increases by 1, the new divisor is k + m -1.

Wait, but for m steps, the divisors are k, k+1, ...,k+m-1. So the first m steps have m divisors. So for m steps, we need to process the first m divisors. But how to process this incrementally.

Wait, the steps are as follows:

For each m from 1 to m_max:

   Compute S_m. If S_m >n, break.

   The divisors for m steps are k, k+1, ...,k+m-1.

   For each x >= S_m:

       D = x - S_m

       the contribution to x's count is the number of ways to form D using the first m divisors.

So the idea is that for each m, after processing the first m divisors, we can answer the number of ways for D for any x. So we need to precompute for each m the array cnt[m][D], which is the number of ways to form D using the first m divisors. But storing this for all m is memory prohibitive. Instead, perhaps we can compute for each m, the cnt[m][D], and for each x, accumulate the sum over all m where S_m <=x of cnt[m][x - S_m].

But how to compute cnt[m][D] efficiently.

Alternative approach: process each m incrementally, adding the divisors one by one (since for m steps, the divisors are the first m divisors starting from k). So for each m, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k+m-1. So for m steps, the divisors are the same as for m-1 steps plus the new divisor k + m-1.

Therefore, we can model the cnt[m][D] as the previous cnt[m-1][D] plus the contributions from the new divisor. But since for the unbounded knapsack problem, adding a new divisor d to the existing divisors allows us to add any multiple of d to the existing sums.

So the dynamic programming approach can be as follows:

We start with an array dp, where dp[D] represents the number of ways to form D using the divisors processed so far.

Initially, for m=0, dp[0] =1, and all other dp[D] =0.

For m steps, the current divisor is k + m -1. Wait, no. Wait, for m steps, the divisors are k, k+1, ..., k + m-1. So when processing m steps, the divisors are from k to k + m-1. So for m=1, the divisor is k. For m=2, divisors are k and k+1. For m=3, divisors are k, k+1, k+2, etc.

So for each m from 1 to m_max:

   divisor = k + m -1

   compute S_m = m*(2k + m-1) // 2

   if S_m >n, break

   for D in 0 to n - S_m:

       the contribution to x = S_m + D is dp_prev[D], where dp_prev is the DP after processing divisors up to k + m-1.

   So for each m, we need to process the new divisor (k + m -1) and update the DP array.

Wait, but the steps are as follows:

Initialize the DP array as [1] + [0]*(n) for D=0.

Then, for each m in 1 to m_max:

   current divisor d =k + m -1

   for D from d to max_D:

       dp_new[D] += dp_new[D -d]

   where max_D is up to n - S_m.

Wait, no. Because for each m, the DP array is built by adding the current divisor. But for each m, the divisors are processed one by one, not all at once. So for example, m=1: add divisor k. For m=2: add divisor k+1, etc. So the DP array is updated each time a new divisor is added.

But wait, each m corresponds to adding the m-th divisor (k + m-1). So processing m from 1 upwards, adding each new divisor and updating the DP array.

But then, after processing m divisors, the DP array represents the number of ways to form D using the first m divisors (k, k+1, ...,k +m-1). Then, for each x, if x >= S_m (the sum of the minimal steps), then D =x - S_m, and the number of ways contributed by this m is dp[D].

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute for each m, the minimal sum S_m. Find all m where S_m <=n.

2. For each such m, compute the number of ways to form D =x - S_m using the first m divisors (k, ...,k+m-1).

3. Sum these counts over all applicable m for each x.

To compute step 2 efficiently:

- For each x in 1..n, accumulate the sum of dp_m [x - S_m] for all m where S_m <=x.

But how to track dp_m for each m? Since each m requires adding a new divisor and updating the DP array, perhaps we can process m incrementally and, for each m, after adding the new divisor, compute the contributions to all x >= S_m.

But how to manage the DP array efficiently.

Let's outline the steps:

Initialize a DP array with dp[0] =1 and the rest 0.

max_m =0

For each x from 1 to n:

   answer[x] =0

For m from 1 to ...:

   compute S_m = m*(2k +m-1)//2

   if S_m >n, break

   d =k +m-1

   for D in range(n, d-1, -1):

       dp[D] = (dp[D] + dp[D -d]) % MOD

   Then, for all x where x >= S_m and x <=n:

       D =x - S_m

       answer[x] += dp[D]

       answer[x] %= MOD

Wait, but the order here is important. For each m, after adding the divisor d=k+m-1 to the DP array, the DP array now represents the ways to form D using divisors up to d. Then, for x in S_m to n:

   D =x -S_m

   answer[x] += dp[D]

But wait, for m=1, S_1 is k*1 =k. The divisor is k. So the DP array after processing m=1 will have dp[D] =1 if D is a multiple of k, else 0. Then, for x >=k:

   D =x -k

   answer[x] +=1 if D is a multiple of k.

But this is only the contribution from m=1.

But here's the problem: the DP array after processing m divisors (k, k+1, ...,k+m-1) includes all possible combinations of those divisors. However, when considering x's contribution from m steps, we need the sum of those divisors (S_m) plus any combination of the first m divisors multiplied by their coefficients. So, the DP array after processing m divisors would have the counts for all possible D's, which are x - S_m for x >=S_m.

But in this approach, for each m, after adding the new divisor, the DP array now includes the new divisor. So for each m, after adding divisor d=k+m-1, the DP array represents the number of ways to form D using the first m divisors (k, k+1, ...,k+m-1).

So for each x, the contribution from m steps is dp[x -S_m], but x must be >= S_m.

But how to compute this for all x. The approach is:

For each m:

   compute S_m.

   if S_m >n, break.

   add the new divisor d=k +m-1 to the DP array.

   then, for all x in [S_m, n], the contribution to x is the current DP[x - S_m].

But to do this, after processing each m, we need to iterate x from S_m to n and add dp[x - S_m] to the answer[x]. However, this would be O(n) per m, which for m up to 632 would be O(632 * 2e5) = ~1.2e8 operations. Which is manageable.

But in Python, this might be tight. So perhaps we can optimize this step.

Wait, for each m, after adding the new divisor d, we can compute for all possible D (x - S_m = D), and x ranges from S_m to n. So D ranges from 0 to n -S_m. So for each D in 0 to n -S_m, answer[S_m + D] += dp[D], modulo MOD.

But how to compute this efficiently. For example:

After processing m, the current DP array holds the number of ways for the first m divisors. Then, the contribution to x is:

for D in 0 to (n - S_m):

   x = S_m + D

   answer[x] += dp[D]

   answer[x] %= MOD

So this is a loop over D from 0 to (n - S_m), which for each m, is O(n) time. But for m up to O(632), this is O(632 * 2e5) = 1.26e8 steps. Which is manageable.

But how can we compute this efficiently.

But wait, the minimal sum S_m for m steps is m*(2k +m-1)/2. For example, when k=1 and m=1, S_1=1. For k=1, m=8, S_8=8*(2*1 +7)/2 =8*9/2=36. But the sample input 8 and k=1's output shows that x=8 has 6 ways. Hmm, but perhaps this approach works.

So here's the detailed algorithm:

Initialize the answer array as [0]*(n+1).

Initialize the DP array as [0]*(n+1), with DP[0] =1.

current_m =0

For m in 1, 2, ...:

   current_m +=1

   d =k + current_m -1

   S_m = current_m*(2k + current_m -1) //2

   if S_m >n:

       break

   # add divisor d to the DP array (unbounded knapsack)

   # update the DP array for multiples of d

   for D in range(d, n+1):

       DP[D] = (DP[D] + DP[D -d]) % MOD

   # compute the contributions to x >= S_m

   max_D = n - S_m

   if max_D <0:

       continue

   for D in range(0, max_D +1):

       x = S_m + D

       answer[x] = (answer[x] + DP[D]) % MOD

So this seems correct. Let's test this approach against the first sample input.

Sample input 1: n=8, k=1.

The minimal sum S_m for m steps:

m=1: S_1=1*(2*1 +0)/2=1. divisor is 1.

m=2: S_2=2*(2*1 +1)/2=2*3/2=3. divisors 1,2.

m=3: 3*(2*1 +2)/2=3*4/2=6. divisors 1,2,3.

m=4:4*(2+3)/2=4*5/2=10>8. So m_max=3.

Processing m=1:

d=1, S_1=1.

Update DP array for divisor 1. The DP array after processing m=1 (current_m=1) is:

For D in 0..n:

DP[D] is 1 for all D >=0, because adding divisor 1 allows any sum. Wait, no. Because for the unbounded knapsack with divisor 1, after adding it, DP[D] = sum_{t} DP[D -t*1] (for t >=1). Wait, but the initial DP was 1 at D=0 and 0 elsewhere. Then, processing divisor 1:

for D from 1 to 8:

DP[D] += DP[D-1]

So initially DP[0] is 1.

For D=1: DP[1] += DP[0] →1.

For D=2: DP[2] += DP[1] →1.

And so on. After processing divisor 1, DP[D] becomes 1 for all D>=0.

So then, for m=1, the contribution to x is for x >=1 (S_m=1):

D can be 0 to 7 (since x can be up to 8, 8-1=7).

For each D in 0..7, x=1+D. So x ranges from 1 to 8.

So answer[x] += DP[D]. Since DP[D] is 1 for all D, each x from 1 to 8 gets 1 added.

So after m=1, answer is [0, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Processing m=2:

current_m=2. d=2 (k=1 +2-1=2). S_2=3. Check if S_2 <=8: yes.

Add divisor 2 to DP.

Update DP array:

for D from 2 to 8:

DP[D] += DP[D-2]

Original DP after m=1 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

After processing divisor 2:

DP[2] =1 +1 →2.

DP[3] =1 +1 →2.

DP[4] =1 +2 →3.

DP[5] =1 +2 →3.

DP[6] =1 +3 →4.

DP[7] =1 +3 →4.

DP[8] =1 +4 →5.

So DP array after m=2:

index:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

values:1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5

Now, for m=2, S_2=3. max_D=8-3=5. D ranges 0..5.

For each D in 0..5:

x=3+D. D=0→3, D=5→8.

The contribution is DP[D], which are:

D=0 →1 →x=3: answer[3] +=1 →now 2.

D=1 →1 →x=4: answer[4] +=1 →2.

D=2 →2 →x=5: answer[5] +=2 →3.

D=3 →2 →x=6: answer[6] +=2 →3.

D=4 →3 →x=7: answer[7] +=3 →4.

D=5 →3 →x=8: answer[8] +=3 →4.

So after m=2, the answer array is:

index:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

values: 0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4.

Then processing m=3:

current_m=3. d=3 (1+3-1=3). S_3=6.

max_D=8-6=2.

Update DP array for divisor 3.

For D in 3..8:

DP[D] += DP[D-3].

Original DP after m=2:

index:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

values:1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5.

Processing divisor 3:

For D=3:

DP[3] += DP[0] →2+1=3.

D=4: DP[4] += DP[1] →3+1=4.

D=5: DP[5] += DP[2] →3+2=5.

D=6: DP[6] += DP[3] →4+3=7.

D=7: DP[7] += DP[4] →4+4=8.

D=8: DP[8] += DP[5] →5+5=10.

So new DP array:

0:1, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:7,7:8,8:10.

Now, for m=3, S_m=6. D can be 0,1,2.

For each D in 0..2:

x=6+D. D=0→6, D=1→7, D=2→8.

Contribution is DP[D] →1,1,2.

So answer[6] +=1 →3+1=4?

Wait, no. Let's see:

Current answer array after m=2:

For x=6, answer is 3.

Now, adding DP[0] (1) for D=0: x=6. So answer[6] +=1 →3+1=4?

Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

After m=2, the answer array for x=6 was 3 (from previous steps). Now, for m=3, x=6 (S_3=6, D=0). So answer[6] += DP[0] =1. So new answer is 3+1=4.

Similarly:

x=7: D=1 →DP[1] =1. So answer[7] +=1 →4+1=5.

x=8: D=2 →DP[2] =2. answer[8] +=2 →4 +2=6.

So after m=3, the answer array becomes:

0,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6.

Which matches the sample output.

So this approach seems correct.

Now, in terms of code:

We need to compute S_m for each m until it exceeds n. For each m, we add the new divisor d=k+m-1, update the DP array (using the unbounded knapsack approach, adding all multiples of d), then for each D from 0 to (n -S_m), add DP[D] to answer[S_m +D].

But for the DP array, when processing each new divisor d, we can update it in a loop from d to n. This is the standard way to process unbounded knapsack.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But in Python, for n up to 2e5, and m up to O(632), the code should be efficient enough.

But let's think about the steps.

First, read n and k.

Initialize the answer array as [0]*(n+1).

Initialize dp array as [0]*(n+1). dp[0] =1.

current_m =0.

Then, for m in 1,2,...:

   current_m +=1

   d =k + current_m -1

   S_m = current_m * (2*k + current_m -1) //2

   if S_m >n:

       break

   # update the dp array for divisor d.

   for j in range(d, n+1):

       dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j -d]) % MOD

   # compute the contribution to answer.

   max_D =n -S_m

   if max_D <0:

       continue

   for D in range(0, max_D +1):

       x = S_m + D

       answer[x] = (answer[x] + dp[D]) % MOD

Then, output the answer[1..n].

But wait, in the sample input, after processing m=3, the DP array is [1,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10], and for m=3, the contribution is for D=0,1,2:

x=6: answer +=1 (DP[0] =1)

x=7: answer +=1 (DP[1] =1)

x=8: answer +=2 (DP[2] =2)

Which matches the sample.

But in the code, the DP array is updated for the divisor d, and then for all D up to max_D, which is n - S_m.

But the DP array after processing m=3 includes divisors up to 3. So the contributions for m=3 steps are correctly calculated.

But there's a problem here. The code as written will process m steps for each current_m, and for each m, the divisors are k, k+1, ...,k + current_m-1. The S_m is the minimal sum for m steps.

But the code is correct.

Now, let's test the second sample input:

Sample input 2:

10 2 →output 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2.

Let's see.

n=10, k=2.

Compute m_max:

m=1: S=2 →possible.

m=2: S=2+3=5 → possible.

m=3: S=2+3+4=9 → possible.

m=4: S=2+3+4+5=14 → larger than 10. So m_max=3.

Processing m=1:

d=2. S_m=2. Update DP by adding divisor 2.

Original DP after m=1:

For D from 2 to 10, DP[D] += DP[D-2]. Initially DP[0] =1.

After processing:

DP[0]=1, DP[2]=1, DP[4]=1, etc. But since this is unbounded, for each even D, DP[D] =1. For odd D, 0.

But wait, in code:

After m=1, the divisor is 2. The DP array is updated by for j in 2 to 10:

dp[j] += dp[j-2].

Initially, dp[0] =1, others 0.

For j=2: dp[2] =0 +1 →1.

j=4: dp[4] += dp[2] →1.

j=6: dp[6] += dp[4] →1.

j=8: dp[8] += dp[6] →1.

j=10: dp[10] += dp[8] →1.

But for j=3: not processed. So for even D, dp[D] is 1, others 0.

Then, for m=1, S_m=2. max_D=10-2=8. D ranges from 0 to 8. But the dp array after m=1 is:

dp[0]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[4]=1, etc.

So for each D in 0, 2,4,6,8 (even numbers up to 8):

x=2 +D.

For D=0 →x=2: answer[2] +=1.

D=2 →x=4: answer[4] +=1.

D=4 →x=6: answer[6] +=1.

D=6 →x=8: answer[8] +=1.

D=8 →x=10: answer[10] +=1.

But the sample input's n is 10, and the output is for x=1-10.

So after m=1, answer[2] is 1, answer[4] is1, etc.

Processing m=2:

current_m=2, d=3. S_m=2+3=5.

Update DP by processing divisor 3.

For j from3 to 10:

dp[j] += dp[j-3].

Original DP after m=1 is:

index:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

vals:1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1.

After processing divisor3:

For j=3: dp[3] += dp[0] →0+1=1.

j=4: dp[4] += dp[1] →1+0=1.

j=5: dp[5] += dp[2] →0+1=1.

j=6: dp[6] += dp[3] →1+1=2.

j=7: dp[7] += dp[4] →0+1=1.

j=8: dp[8] += dp[5] →1+1=2.

j=9: dp[9] += dp[6] →0+2=2.

j=10: dp[10] += dp[7] →1+1=2.

Now, the DP array is:

0:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:1,4:1,5:1,6:2,7:1,8:2,9:2,10:2.

Now, for m=2, S_m=5. max_D=10-5=5. So D ranges from0 to5.

For each D in 0-5:

x=5+D.

D=0 →5. answer[5] += dp[0] =1 → answer[5] =1.

D=1 →6. answer[6] += dp[1] =0 → no change.

D=2 →7. answer[7] += dp[2] =1 →1.

D=3 →8. answer[8] += dp[3] =1 →1+1=2.

D=4 →9. answer[9] += dp[4] =1 →1.

D=5 →10. answer[10] += dp[5] =1 →1+1=2.

So after m=2, answer[5]=1, answer[7]=1, answer[8]=2, answer[9]=1, answer[10]=2.

Processing m=3:

current_m=3, d=4. S_m=5+4=9.

Update DP array with divisor4.

For j from4 to 10:

dp[j] += dp[j-4].

Original DP after m=2:

index:0-10 values:

[1,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,2]

Processing divisor4:

j=4: dp[4] += dp[0] →1+1=2.

j=5: dp[5] += dp[1] →1+0=1.

j=6: dp[6] += dp[2] →2+1=3.

j=7: dp[7] += dp[3] →1+1=2.

j=8: dp[8] += dp[4] →2+2=4.

j=9: dp[9] += dp[5] →2+1=3.

j=10: dp[10] += dp[6] →2+3=5.

New DP array:

0:1, 1:0, 2:1,3:1,4:2,5:1,6:3,7:2,8:4,9:3,10:5.

Now, S_m=9. max_D=10-9=1. So D can be 0 and 1.

x=9 →D=0: answer[9] += dp[0] =1 →1+1=2.

x=10 →D=1: answer[10] += dp[1] =0 → no change.

So after m=3, answer[9] is 2, answer[10] remains 2.

So the final answer array after processing all m's is:

For x=1:0.

x=2:1 (from m=1, D=0).

x=3:0.

x=4:1 (m=1, D=2).

x=5:1 (m=2, D=0).

x=6:1 (m=1, D=4) → initial contribution from m=1, D=4 →x=2+4=6. But after m=2, x=6's contribution was D=1 (but dp[1] was 0, so no change. After m=3, D=0 for x=9, so x=6 is only contributed by m=1 (D=4 →4 is even, but S_m=2. x=6=2+4, D=4. dp[D=4] is 1 (after m=1, dp[4]=1). So answer[6] is 1.

But according to the sample output for input 10 2, the output is 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2.

Wait, let's see:

The sample output for x=7 is 1.

In our code, after m=2, answer[7] is 1 (from m=2, D=2 → x=5+2=7. D=2: dp[D=2]=1. So answer[7] +=1.

In m=3, S_m=9. For x=9, D=0 →dp[0] =1. answer[9] +=1. So answer[9] becomes 2.

But let's see the final answer array:

x : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

after m=1: 0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1.

But wait, when m=1, S_m=2. D can be from 0 to 8 (n -S_m=10-2=8). But x=2+D.

For D=0 →x=2. answer[2] +=1.

D=2 →x=4. answer[4] +=1.

D=4 →x=6. answer[6] +=1.

D=6 →x=8. answer[8] +=1.

D=8 →x=10. answer[10] +=1.

Other D's (like 1,3,5,7) have dp[D] =0, so no contribution.

So after m=1, answer[2]=1, answer[4]=1, answer[6]=1, answer[8]=1, answer[10}=1.

Then m=2:

S_m=5. D can be 0-5.

D=0 →x=5. answer[5] +=1.

D=2 →x=7. answer[7] +=1.

D=3 →x=8. answer[8] +=1 → now 2.

D=4 →x=9. answer[9] +=1.

D=5 →x=10. answer[10] +=1 → now 2.

Then m=3:

S_m=9. D can be 0 and 1.

D=0 →x=9. answer[9] +=1 →2.

D=1 →x=10. answer[10] +=0.

So the final answer array is:

x=1: 0

x=2:1

x=3:0

x=4:1

x=5:1

x=6:1

x=7:1

x=8:2

x=9:2

x=10:2.

Which matches the sample output: 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2.

Thus, the code works for the sample.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python.

But for the DP array, we need to process up to 2e5 elements. And for each m, the loop for adding the divisor d is O(n) time. For m up to O(632), this is acceptable.

Now, let's write the code.

The steps are:

- Read n and k.

- Initialize answer array as [0]*(n+2).

- Initialize dp array as [0]*(n+2), with dp[0] =1.

- current_m =0.

- While True:

   current_m +=1.

   d =k + current_m -1.

   S_m = current_m*(2*k + current_m -1) //2.

   if S_m >n:

       break.

   # Update DP for divisor d.

   for j in range(d, n+1):

       dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j -d]) % 998244353

   # compute contributions.

   max_D =n -S_m

   if max_D <0:

       continue

   for D in range(0, max_D +1):

       x =S_m + D

       answer[x] = (answer[x] + dp[D]) % 998244353

- Finally, output the answer[1..n], space-separated.

But in Python, for n=2e5, this may be slow. Because for each m, the loop for updating the DP array is O(n). For m up to 632, this is 632*2e5=1.26e8 operations. Which is manageable in Python for a 2-second time limit. But let's see.

In the worst case, when k=1, m_max is about sqrt(2n) = sqrt(4e5) ~ 632. So the code should work.

Another optimization: precompute all m where S_m <=n, then process them in order.

But the code as written should work.

Testing the code with the samples.

Sample 1:

n=8, k=1.

The code should output 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

n=10, k=2.

The code outputs 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2, which matches.

Thus, the code should be correct.
</think>

```python
MOD = 998244353

n, k = map(int, input().split())

answer = [0] * (n + 1)
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 1

current_m = 0

while True:
    current_m += 1
    d = k + current_m - 1
    S_m = current_m * (2 * k + current_m - 1) // 2
    if S_m > n:
        break
