Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

So, the problem is about finding the minimal possible area of a rectangle that could contain all the points from Pavel's notes. The catch is that the coordinates are given in a shuffled order. So Pavel wrote down all the x and y coordinates in a list, but we don't know which are x and which are y. Our task is to determine the minimal area possible by partitioning these 2n numbers into n pairs (each pair being the x and y of a point) such that when all points are considered, the minimal rectangle's area is minimized.

Hmm. So the key is that the given list of 2n numbers can be split into x and y coordinates in any way, as long as each point gets exactly one x and one y. Then, after splitting, we need to find the minimal area rectangle that encloses all those points, and among all possible valid splits, choose the one that gives the smallest possible area.

Wait, but how do we split the list into x and y? The numbers are all mixed. So for example, if the input is 4 numbers a, b, c, d, then possible splits are (a and b) as x and y for the first point, (c and d) for the second; or (a and c), (b and d), etc. But since the list has 2n elements, we need to split them into n pairs. But each pair contributes one x and one y coordinate for a point. But the problem states that Pavel's list is all the x and y coordinates of the n points, but in some order. So each pair in the list is not a point; rather, all the x's and y's are shuffled. Wait, no. Wait the input is 2n numbers. These are the coordinates of n points, but their x and y components are all mixed. So for example, if n is 4, there are 8 numbers. The actual points are formed by selecting n x coordinates and n y coordinates, and pairing each x with a y. So each of the 2n numbers is either used as an x or a y of a point. So for example, for n=2, the numbers a1, a2, a3, a4 can be split into x1, x2 (two numbers) and y1, y2 (the other two). Then each point is (x_i, y_j), but no, that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the n points are formed by selecting n x coordinates and n y coordinates, but each x and y must be used exactly once. So for n points, there are exactly n x's and n y's. So the 2n numbers must be partitioned into two groups of n each: the x coordinates and the y coordinates. Then, each x is paired with a y. So the points are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn). But wait, that's not the case. Because the problem says that the points are written in some order. So maybe the 2n numbers are arranged such that each point is (a_2k-1, a_2k), but the order of the points is mixed. Wait, no. The problem statement says that the order is such that it's impossible to tell which numbers specify which coordinates of which points. So the actual points are formed by taking all 2n numbers, and dividing them into n pairs (each pair is a point), but the x and y can be arranged in any way. So for example, in the first sample input:

4
4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3

The output is 1, which comes from the points (1,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4). Wait, but how do those numbers split into x and y? Let's see: the list is [4,1,3,2,3,2,1,3]. So the x's are 1,1,2,2 (the first, fourth, sixth, seventh elements?), but I'm not sure. Wait, no. The split into x and y must be that exactly n numbers are x's and the other n are y's. Then each x is paired with a y. So for example, if the x's are [1, 1, 2, 2], and the y's are [3,3,3,4], then the points are (1,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4). The minimal rectangle here would have x from 1 to 2, and y from 3 to4, area is (2-1)*(4-3) =1*1=1. That's the sample.

So the approach is: we need to split the 2n numbers into two groups, each of size n: x coordinates and y coordinates. Then, compute the minimal rectangle that covers all the points formed by pairing each x with a y. Then, among all possible valid splits (splits where the x and y groups are each of size n), find the split that gives the minimal possible area.

But how do we do this efficiently? Because the brute force approach would be to try all possible splits, but for n up to 1e5, that's impossible.

Wait, n is up to 1e5, so 2n is up to 2e5. So we need an O(n log n) solution.

Hmm. Let's think: the minimal area is determined by the x and y ranges. The area is (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y). So to minimize the area, we need to choose a split into x and y groups such that the product of (max_x - min_x) and (max_y - min_y) is as small as possible.

But how to split the 2n numbers into x and y groups, each of size n, to minimize this product.

But the problem is that each x and y group must have exactly n elements. So the question is to partition the array into two subsets, each of size n, such that the product of (max subset A - min subset A) and (max subset B - min subset B) is minimized.

Wait, but the subsets A and B are the x's and y's. So the x's are subset A (size n), and the y's are subset B (size n). Then, the points are (a_i, b_j) for all i and j? No. Wait no. Because each x is paired with a y. Wait, no. Because each point is formed by one x and one y. So the points are (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n). So the x coordinates are x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, and the y coordinates are y_1, y_2, ..., y_n. Then, the minimal rectangle is [min_x, max_x] Ã— [min_y, max_y]. So the area is (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y). So regardless of how x's and y's are paired, the rectangle is determined by the min and max of x's and min and max of y's. Because all x's are used, all y's are used, and each point has one x and one y, but the pairing doesn't affect the min and max of x and y. For example, if the x's are [1,2,3] and y's are [4,5,6], the min x is 1, max x 3, min y 4, max y 6. The area is 2*2=4. So the pairing between x and y doesn't matter. So the problem reduces to partitioning the 2n numbers into two subsets of size n each (x and y), then compute the area as (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y), and find the partition that gives the minimal area.

Oh! So the pairing between x and y coordinates does not matter. All that matters is which numbers are chosen as x's and which as y's. Because when you select x's and y's, the minimal and maximal of each group determine the rectangle. So the problem becomes: select a subset S of n elements from the 2n elements (S is the x's), and the remaining n elements (the y's). Then compute (max(S) - min(S)) * (max(T) - min(T)), where T is the y's. We need to find the minimal possible value of this product.

So the problem reduces to splitting the list into two subsets of size n, S and T, and compute the product of their ranges. Then find the split that minimizes this product.

Now the problem is similar to partitioning the array into two subsets of size n, each, and compute the product of their ranges, then find the minimal such product.

So how to approach this?

The first thought is that the minimal product can be achieved when one of the subsets has as small a range as possible, and the other's range is also minimized. But how to find such splits.

But considering that the input numbers can be up to 1e9, and n up to 1e5, we need an O(n log n) solution.

Let me think about the possible scenarios. Let's sort the array. Then, perhaps the optimal split can be found by considering certain positions in the sorted array.

For example, after sorting the array, perhaps the minimal product occurs when the x's are a contiguous block of n elements in the sorted array, and the y's are the remaining elements. Or maybe some other arrangement.

Wait, for example, in the first sample input:

The sorted list is [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4]. The split into x's is [1,1,2,2] (n=4). Then the x range is 2-1=1. The y's are [3,3,3,4], range is 4-3=1. Product is 1*1=1.

But another possible split could be x's as [1,1,2,3], y's as [2,3,3,4]. Then x's range is 3-1=2, y's range 4-2=2. Product is 4. Not better.

So the optimal split in the first case is taking the first 4 elements as x's. Then the remaining as y's.

But how to generalize this?

Alternatively, maybe the minimal product is achieved by taking a consecutive block of n elements for x's, and the remaining as y's. Then, among all possible consecutive blocks of n elements, compute the product of the range of the block and the range of the remaining elements, and find the minimal.

But is this always the case?

Let's think about the second sample input:

3
5 8 5 5 7 5

Sorted list is [5,5,5,5,7,8]. n=3, so split into x's (3 elements) and y's (3 elements). The split that gives x's as [5,5,5] and y's as [5,7,8]. Then x range is 0, y range is 3. Product 0. Which is the correct output.

Another possible split: x's as [5,5,7], y's as [5,5,8]. x range 2, y range 3. Product 6. Which is worse.

So the optimal split here is taking the first 3 elements as x's.

But in this case, there are multiple possible splits that give a product of 0. For example, any split where the x's have all elements equal. So if the array has multiple duplicates, then the minimal product can be zero.

So perhaps the key is to find a split where one of the subsets has a range of zero. But that's possible only if there are at least n elements with the same value.

So, to find such splits, perhaps we can look for the minimal product by considering all possible consecutive n-length windows in the sorted array, and compute the product of that window's range and the remaining elements' range.

But why consecutive windows?

Because when the array is sorted, taking a consecutive block of n elements would minimize their range, and the remaining elements would have their own range. So by sliding a window of size n through the sorted array, we can find the minimal possible product.

But what about non-consecutive windows?

For example, suppose the sorted array is [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6], n=3. Maybe taking a1, a3, a5 as x's. But their range is a5 - a1. The remaining a2, a4, a6 have a range a6 - a2. But the product could be larger than if we take a consecutive window.

So perhaps the minimal product is achieved by consecutive windows. Because the sorted array allows consecutive windows to have minimal possible range for that subset.

Therefore, the approach is to sort the array, then for each possible consecutive window of size n, compute the range of the window (as x's), and the range of the remaining elements (as y's). Then take the product and keep the minimum.

But wait, the window of size n could be either x's or y's. For example, when we have 2n elements, sorted, a window of n elements could be the x's (so the other n are y's), or vice versa. But since the order of x and y can be swapped (i.e., the x's could be the window or the y's could be the window), we need to compute both possibilities for each window.

Wait, no. Because if the window is the x's, then the remaining are the y's. If the window is the y's, then the remaining are the x's. But the product (x_range * y_range) is the same as (y_range * x_range), so considering the window as x's or y's doesn't change the product. So it's sufficient to check all consecutive windows of size n, compute their range and the range of the remaining elements, and take the minimal product.

Additionally, for the case where n is 1: Then, the split is one x and one y. The range for x is 0 (since there's one element), and range for y is 0. So the product is 0.

Wait, but in this problem, when n=1, the input is two numbers. So the x is one, y is the other. The rectangle's area is (x - x) * (y - y) =0, since all points (the single point) is (x,y). So for n=1, the area is always zero.

So, the general approach is:

1. Sort the entire array.

2. Check all possible consecutive windows of size n. For each window:

   a. The window is considered as x's (n elements), and the remaining as y's (n elements). Compute the product of (window_max - window_min) * (remaining_max - remaining_min).

   b. The window could also be considered as y's, but as discussed earlier, the product is the same. So no need to check twice.

3. Find the minimal product among all such possibilities.

4. Also, consider the case where the entire array is split into two parts where one part has all elements equal. For example, if there are n elements with the same value, then the range for x is zero, so the product is zero, which is minimal. So this case needs to be handled.

But how? Well, when you have a window of n elements where all are the same, then the range for x is zero, so the product is zero. So if such a window exists, then the minimal product is zero. But when sliding the window, if any window has min == max, then the product will be zero.

So our approach of checking all consecutive windows of size n will capture this case.

But let's think: for the second sample input, sorted array is [5,5,5,5,7,8], n=3. The window of first 3 elements is [5,5,5], range 0. Remaining elements [5,7,8], range 8-5=3. Product is 0. So that's the minimal possible.

Another possible window is elements 1-3 (indexes 0-2) [5,5,5], product is 0.

So the approach works here.

Another example: the first sample input, after sorting, the array is [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4]. n=4. The window is 4 elements. The first 4 elements are [1,1,2,2], range 1. Remaining elements [3,3,3,4], range 1. Product 1*1=1. Which is the correct answer.

Another possible window is elements 2-5 (indices 1-4?), but maybe not. Let's see:

If the window is the first 4 elements, as before. But another window like elements 0-3 (1,1,2,2), same as before. But other possible windows may not give better products.

So the approach of checking all consecutive windows of size n in the sorted array seems to work.

But how many such windows are there? Since the array has 2n elements, the number of possible consecutive windows of size n is (2n -n +1) = n+1. For n=1e5, that's 1e5+1 windows, which is manageable. For each window, we can compute the range (window_max - window_min) and the range of the remaining elements.

But how to compute the range of the remaining elements efficiently?

Wait, the sorted array is sorted. So the remaining elements after a window is either the elements before the window and the elements after.

For example, for a window starting at index i and ending at index i +n-1 (inclusive), the remaining elements are the elements from 0 to i-1 and i+n to 2n-1. The min of the remaining elements is the minimum between the min of the left part and the min of the right part. But since the array is sorted, the left part is sorted, and the right part is sorted. So the min of the remaining elements is the min of the left part (if exists) and the right part (if exists). But the left part's min is the first element (since sorted), and the right part's min is the first element in the right part.

Wait, in the sorted array, the elements are in non-decreasing order. So for a window from i to j (j = i +n-1), the remaining elements are:

left: elements 0..i-1 (if i>0)

right: elements j+1..2n-1 (if j+1 <=2n-1)

So the min of the remaining elements is the min of (left[0] if left exists) and (right[0] if right exists). But since the array is sorted, the left elements are all <= window elements, and the right elements are all >= window elements. Wait no. Because the entire array is sorted. So the left part (elements before the window) are all <= the elements in the window. The right part (elements after the window) are all >= the elements in the window.

So the min of the remaining elements is the first element of the left part (if exists) or the first element of the right part (if left doesn't exist). Wait, no. Wait the left part is sorted, so the min is the first element. The right part is sorted, so the min is the first element of the right part. But the entire array is sorted, so all left elements are <= all right elements. So the min of the remaining elements is the first element of the left part if it exists, else the first element of the right part.

Similarly, the max of the remaining elements is the last element of the right part if it exists, else the last element of the left part.

So the min of the remaining is min_left = the first element of the left part if i>0, else the first element of the right part (which is the first element of the entire array, but if window starts at 0, then left part is empty, so remaining elements are the right part, which starts at index n (window is 0..n-1). The first element of the right part is array[n], which is >= array[window_end] (since array is sorted). The max of the remaining elements is the last element of the right part if it exists (since it's sorted), else the last element of the left part.

But how to compute this?

For the remaining elements:

min_remaining = array[0] if the window starts at i>0, else array[window_end +1] (since the window is the first n elements, the remaining elements are from window_end+1 to 2n-1).

Wait, no. For example, if the window is from i=0 to i+n-1 =n-1. Then the remaining elements are from n to 2n-1. The min of the remaining is array[n], and the max is array[2n-1].

Similarly, if the window is from i=1 to i+n-1 =n. Then the remaining elements are 0 (array[0]) and n+1 to 2n-1. The min of remaining is array[0], and the max is array[2n-1].

So, for any window starting at i (window is i to i+n-1):

if i ==0:

   remaining elements are i+n ... 2n-1.

   min_remaining = array[i+n]

   max_remaining = array[2n-1]

elif i +n ==2n:

   remaining elements are 0 ... i-1.

   min_remaining = array[0]

   max_remaining = array[i-1]

else:

   remaining elements are 0 ... i-1 and i+n ... 2n-1.

   min_remaining = array[0] (since array is sorted, 0 ... i-1 is <= i ... i+n-1, and i+n ... 2n-1 is >= i ... i+n-1. So the min of remaining is min of array[0] (from left part) and array[i+n] (from right part). Wait, no. Because array is sorted, the left part is the first i elements (0 to i-1) which are all <= the elements in the window. The right part (i+n to 2n-1) are all >= the elements in the window. So the left part's elements are all <= the window's elements, and the right part's elements are >= the window's elements. So the min_remaining is the left part's min (array[0], since the left part starts from 0) if left part is not empty. If left part is empty, then the min is array[i+n]. Similarly, the max_remaining is the right part's max (array[2n-1]) if right part is not empty. Otherwise, it's the left part's max (array[i-1]).

Wait, but when the window is in the middle, the remaining elements are the left part (0..i-1) and the right part (i+n..2n-1). The left part is sorted, the right part is sorted. So the min of the remaining elements is the min of the left part's min (array[0]) and the right part's min (array[i+n]). But since array is sorted, array[i-1] <= array[i] <= array[i+n], so array[0] is the min of the entire array. So the min_remaining is array[0], because the left part includes array[0]. Unless the left part is empty (i=0), in which case the min_remaining is array[i+n].

Similarly, the max_remaining is the max of the right part's max (array[2n-1]) and the left part's max (array[i-1], if left part exists). But array[2n-1] is the largest in the entire array, so the max_remaining is array[2n-1].

Wait, because if there is a right part, then the max_remaining is array[2n-1], which is the maximum of the entire array. If there is no right part (i.e., window ends at 2n-1), then the remaining elements are the left part, and their max is array[i-1].

So to compute the min_remaining and max_remaining for a window starting at i:

if i ==0:

   min_remaining = array[i+n]

   max_remaining = array[2n-1]

elif i +n == 2n:

   min_remaining = array[0]

   max_remaining = array[i-1]

else:

   min_remaining = array[0]

   max_remaining = array[2n-1]

So regardless of i (as long as it's not 0 or 2n -n), the min_remaining is array[0], and max_remaining is array[2n-1]. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if the window is in the middle, then the remaining elements are 0..i-1 and i+n..2n-1. So the min_remaining is the minimum between array[0] (the min of the left part) and array[i+n] (the first element of the right part). But array is sorted, so array[0] <= array[i] <= array[i+n]. So array[0] is the min_remaining. Similarly, the max_remaining is array[2n-1], which is the max of the right part. So for all cases except when the window is at the start or end, the min_remaining is array[0] and the max_remaining is array[2n-1].

Wait, but when the window is in the middle, the left part (0..i-1) and the right part (i+n..2n-1). The left part's min is array[0], and the right part's min is array[i+n]. But since array is sorted, array[i] <= array[i+n], but array[0] is the min of the entire array. So min_remaining is array[0], since it's the smallest of all remaining elements.

Similarly, the right part's max is array[2n-1], which is the overall max. So for any window except the first n elements, or the last n elements, the min_remaining and max_remaining are array[0] and array[2n-1], respectively.

Only when the window is at the start (i=0) or at the end (i=2n -n =n) do the remaining elements' min and max change.

So for any window not at the start or end:

The min_remaining is array[0], max_remaining is array[2n-1]. So the range of the remaining elements is array[2n-1] - array[0].

But wait, that's not correct. Because when the window is in the middle, the remaining elements consist of the left and right parts, and the min is array[0], max is array[2n-1]. So the range is (array[2n-1] - array[0]).

But when the window is at the start (i=0), the remaining elements are the right part (from n to 2n-1). So their min is array[n], max is array[2n-1]. So the range is array[2n-1] - array[n].

When the window is at the end (i =n), then the remaining elements are from 0 to n-1. So their min is array[0], max is array[n-1]. So the range is array[n-1] - array[0].

So in general, for a window starting at i:

if i ==0:

   remaining_min = array[n]

   remaining_max = array[2n-1]

   remaining_range = array[2n-1] - array[n]

elif i +n == 2n:

   remaining_min = array[0]

   remaining_max = array[i-1]

   remaining_range = array[i-1] - array[0]

else:

   remaining_min = array[0]

   remaining_max = array[2n-1]

   remaining_range = array[2n-1] - array[0]

So, for each window, the remaining elements' range can be computed based on these cases.

The window's own range is array[i +n -1] - array[i].

Thus, for each window i:

window_range = array[i +n -1] - array[i]

remaining_range:

   if i ==0: array[2n-1] - array[n]

   elif i +n ==2n: array[i-1] - array[0]

   else: array[2n-1] - array[0]

product = window_range * remaining_range

We need to compute this product for all possible i (windows of size n), and find the minimal product.

So the algorithm steps are:

1. Sort the array.

2. Iterate over all possible windows of size n (i from 0 to (2n -n) =n).

   For each i in 0 <=i <=n:

      window starts at i, ends at i +n -1.

      compute window_range = array[i +n -1] - array[i]

      compute remaining_range:

         if i ==0:

             remaining_range = array[2n-1] - array[n]

         elif i +n ==2n:

             remaining_range = array[i-1] - array[0]

         else:

             remaining_range = array[2n-1] - array[0]

      product = window_range * remaining_range

      keep track of the minimal product.

3. The minimal product among all such possibilities is the answer.

But wait, for each window, the window can be considered as x's or y's. For example, for window i, the product is (x_range * y_range). But what if the window is the y's and the remaining are x's? Then the product is same. So no need to consider that.

But in the algorithm, we are considering window as x's and remaining as y's. But since x and y can be swapped, the product is the same, so no need to check both.

Thus, the algorithm is to check all possible consecutive windows of size n in the sorted array, compute the product as per the window and remaining ranges, and select the minimal.

This approach is O(n log n) for sorting, and O(n) for processing each window. So for n up to 1e5, it's manageable.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

First sample:

Input:

4

4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3

After sorting: [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4]

Possible windows of size 4:

i=0: window is [1,1,2,2], window_range=2-1=1. remaining elements [3,3,3,4], remaining_range=4-3=1. product 1*1=1.

i=1: window [1,2,2,3], window_range 3-1=2. remaining elements: [1,3,3,4]. remaining_range: since i=1 is not 0 nor 4 (n=4, 2n=8. i+n =5 <8, so remaining_range is array[7] - array[0] =4-1=3. product 2*3=6.

i=2: window [2,2,3,3], window_range 3-2=1. remaining elements: [1,1,3,4]. remaining_range:4-1=3. product 1*3=3.

i=3: window [2,3,3,3], window_range 3-2=1. remaining elements [1,1,2,4]. remaining_range:4-1=3. product 1*3=3.

i=4: window [3,3,3,4], window_range 4-3=1. remaining elements [1,1,2,2]. remaining_range 2-1=1. product 1*1=1.

So the minimal product is 1. But according to the algorithm, the code would check i=0 and i=4. Both have product 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.

Another sample:

Input:

3

5 8 5 5 7 5

sorted array: [5,5,5,5,7,8]

Possible windows of size 3:

i=0: window [5,5,5], window_range 0. remaining elements [5,7,8]. remaining_range 8-5=3. product 0*3=0.

i=1: window [5,5,5], window_range 0. remaining elements [5,7,8]. product 0*3=0.

i=2: window [5,5,7], window_range 2. remaining elements [5,5,8]. remaining_range 8-5=3. product 2*3=6.

i=3: window [5,7,8], window_range 3. remaining elements [5,5,5]. remaining_range 0. product 3*0=0.

So possible products are 0,0,6,0. The minimal is 0.

Thus, the algorithm works for the second sample.

Another test case: n=1.

Input: 1 2 3. Wait no. Wait n=1, so 2n=2 elements.

Sample input:

1

5 5

After sorting, [5,5]. window is of size 1. possible i=0 and i=1.

i=0: window is [5], window_range 0. remaining element [5], remaining_range 0. product 0*0=0.

i=1: window is [5], remaining element [5]. product same.

So output 0.

Another test case: n=2.

Input:

2

1 3 2 4

Sorted array: [1,2,3,4].

Possible windows of size 2:

i=0: [1,2] â†’ window_range 1. remaining elements [3,4], remaining_range 1. product 1*1=1.

i=1: [2,3] â†’ window_range 1. remaining elements [1,4]. remaining_range 3. product 1*3=3.

i=2: [3,4] â†’ window_range 1. remaining elements [1,2]. remaining_range 1. product 1*1=1.

The minimal product is 1. But wait, the actual split could be taking x's as 1 and 3, y's as 2 and4. Then x's range is 2, y's range 2. product 4. Or x's as 1 and4, y's as 2 and3. x range 3, y range 1. product 3. But according to the algorithm, the minimal product is 1. Wait, this suggests that the algorithm may not capture all possible splits.

Wait, but in this example, according to the algorithm, the minimal product is 1 (from i=0 and i=2). But the actual split could be x's as [1,4], y's as [2,3]. The x's range is 3, y's range 1. Product 3*1=3, which is higher than 1.

So what's the best possible split?

Wait, the algorithm's approach gives a minimal product of 1. Let's see.

The possible splits:

For i=0: x's are [1,2], y's [3,4]. The ranges are (2-1)=1, (4-3)=1. Product 1*1=1.

Which is the split considered by the algorithm.

Another possible split is x's as [1,3], y's [2,4]. The x range is 2, y range 2. Product 4.

So the algorithm's approach is correct here.

Another possible split is x's as [1,4], y's [2,3]. But this is not possible, since x's must be of size 2, and y's size 2. So the split must be two numbers for x and two for y. So in this example, the algorithm's approach finds the minimal product.

Thus, the algorithm works.

But what about a case where the optimal split is not a consecutive window in the sorted array?

Let's consider another example.

n=2, sorted array [1, 2, 5, 6]. The consecutive windows are:

i=0: [1,2], window range 1. remaining elements [5,6], range 1. product 1*1=1.

i=1: [2,5], range 3. remaining elements [1,6], range 5. product 3*5=15.

i=2: [5,6], range 1. remaining elements [1,2], range 1. product 1*1=1.

So the minimal product is 1.

But what if the split is x's [1,5], y's [2,6]. The x range is 4, y range 4. product 16. Worse than 1.

Another split: x's [1,6], y's [2,5]. x range 5, y range 3. product 15. Still worse.

Thus, the consecutive window approach works.

But what if the sorted array is [1,3,4,5,6,8], n=3. So 2n=6.

Possible windows:

i=0: [1,3,4], range 3. remaining [5,6,8], range 3. product 3*3=9.

i=1: [3,4,5], range 2. remaining [1,6,8]. remaining_range: 8-1=7. product 2*7=14.

i=2: [4,5,6], range 2. remaining [1,3,8]. remaining_range 7. product 2*7=14.

i=3: [5,6,8], range 3. remaining [1,3,4]. range 3. product 3*3=9.

So the minimal product is 9.

But what if there's a split where x's are [1,5,8], y's [3,4,6]. x's range is 7, y's range 3. product 21. Worse.

Thus, the algorithm is correct.

So the approach is to sort the array, then for each possible consecutive window of size n, compute the product and take the minimal.

Now, to implement this in Python:

Steps:

1. Read n.

2. Read the list of 2n integers.

3. Sort the list.

4. Compute the minimal product:

   a. Iterate i from 0 to n (since window size is n, and the array is 2n elements, the starting index i can be from 0 to n inclusive).

   b. For each i, compute window_range = a[i +n -1] - a[i].

   c. Compute remaining_range based on i:

      if i ==0:

          remaining_min = a[n]

          remaining_max = a[2n-1]

      elif i +n == 2n:

          remaining_min = a[0]

          remaining_max = a[i-1]

      else:

          remaining_min = a[0]

          remaining_max = a[2n-1]

      remaining_range = remaining_max - remaining_min

      product = window_range * remaining_range

      track the minimal product.

5. Output the minimal product.

But wait, for the case when i is in the middle, the remaining elements are both left and right parts. So their min is a[0], and max is a[2n-1]. So regardless of the window's position (except for i=0 and i =n), the remaining_range is a[2n-1] -a[0].

Thus, in code:

for each i in 0 to n:

   window_end = i +n -1

   if window_end >= 2n:

       break  # not possible.

   window_range = a[window_end] - a[i]

   if i ==0:

       # remaining is a[n ... 2n-1]

       rem_min = a[n]

       rem_max = a[2n-1]

   elif i +n == 2n:

       # remaining is a[0 ... i-1]

       rem_min = a[0]

       rem_max = a[i-1]

   else:

       rem_min = a[0]

       rem_max = a[2n-1]

   rem_range = rem_max - rem_min

   product = window_range * rem_range

   min_product = min(min_product, product)

So the code can be written as follows.

But note that when n=1, 2n=2. So possible i's are 0 and 1.

For i=0: window is [0..0], rem is [1..1]. rem_min =a[1], rem_max =a[1]. rem_range 0. product (a[0]-a[0]) * (a[1]-a[1]) =0*0=0.

For i=1: window is [1..1], rem is [0..0]. product same.

So code works.

Another case where n=2, 2n=4. i can be 0,1,2.

i=0: window [0,1], rem [2,3].

i=1: window [1,2], rem [0,3].

i=2: window [2,3], rem [0,1].

So code covers all possibilities.

Now, implement this.

Now, let's code this in Python.

Read input:

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

sort a.

Then compute.

But n can be up to 1e5, 2n up to 2e5. So sorting is O(n log n), acceptable.

Now code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    a.sort()

    min_product = float('inf')

    total = 2 * n

    for i in range(n + 1):

        # window starts at i, ends at i + n -1

        window_end = i + n -1

        if window_end >= total:

            break

        window_range = a[window_end] - a[i]

        # compute remaining_range

        if i ==0:

            # remaining is from n to 2n-1

            rem_min = a[n]

            rem_max = a[-1]

        elif i +n == total:

            # remaining is from 0 to i-1

            rem_min = a[0]

            rem_max = a[i-1]

        else:

            rem_min = a[0]

            rem_max = a[-1]

        rem_range = rem_max - rem_min

        product = window_range * rem_range

        if product < min_product:

            min_product = product

    print(min_product, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3
5 8 5 5 7 5
""",
            "output": \
"""\
0
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample:

3

5 8 5 5 7 5 â†’ sorted [5,5,5,5,7,8]

total=6.

n=3.

i can be 0,1,2,3.

i=0:

window_end=0+3-1=2. a[2] -a[0] =5-5=0.

rem_min =a[3]=5, rem_max=8. rem_range=3. product=0*3=0.

i=1:

window_end=1+3-1=3. a[3]-a[1] =5-5=0. rem is a[0,4,5]. rem_min=5, rem_max=8. product 0*3=0.

i=2:

window_end=2+3-1=4. a[4] is7, a[2] is5. range 2.

i+3=2+3=5 <6. So rem_min=5, rem_max=8. product 2*(8-5)=6.

i=3:

window_end=3+3-1=5. a[5]-a[3]=8-5=3.

rem is a[0..2], rem_min=5, rem_max=5. range 0. product 3*0=0.

So minimal is 0.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, the code should be correct.

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
total = 2 * n
min_area = float('inf')

for i in range(n + 1):
    window_end = i + n - 1
    if window_end >= total:
        break
    window_min = a[i]
    window_max = a[window_end]
    window_size = window_max - window_min

    if i == 0:
        rem_min = a[n]
        rem_max = a[-1]

    rem_size = rem_max - rem_min

    current_area = window_size * rem_size
    if current_area < min_area:
