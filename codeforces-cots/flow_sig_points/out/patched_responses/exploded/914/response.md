Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine the lexicographically smallest priority list for a given student k, given the way the teams were formed. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem statement says that teams are formed by selecting the highest-ranked remaining student (the captain) who then picks two teammates from the remaining students based on their priority list. Our job is to reconstruct the priority list for student k, ensuring it's the lex smallest possible.

The key points here are understanding how the team formation process works and how to reverse-engineer the priority list for k. Let's think about the steps involved.

So, given the initial ranking (the permutation in the input), the teams are formed in the order they were created. Each team is formed by the next highest-ranked student (the captain) selecting two others. For each team in the given order, the captain is the highest-ranked student in that team. Because the teams are listed in the order they were created, the captains are in the order of their ranks. Wait, but the initial permutation gives the order of the students from first (highest) to last. So the first team's captain is the first in the ranking (if they are part of that team). Wait, no. Wait, no: the process is that while there are people not in a team, we pick the highest remaining student (according to the initial results) as captain. So the captains are the next highest available student each time. The order of the teams in the input is the order in which they were formed. So the first team in the input list is the first team created, and the captain of that team is the highest-ranked student among all students not yet in a team at that time.

So for each team in the input, the captain is the highest-ranked (in the initial permutation) student in that team. The other two members were chosen by the captain. The captain's priority list must be such that, when he picks, he picks the two students with the earliest possible positions in his priority list (to form the lex smallest list) given the constraints of the team formation.

But for our problem, we need to find the lex smallest possible priority list for k that is compatible with the given team arrangement. So how do we model this?

Let's start by processing the teams in the order they were formed. For each team, the captain is the one with the highest priority (i.e., earliest in the initial ranking) in the team. The other two members are the ones selected by the captain. So for each team, the captain's priority list must include the two other members in the earliest possible positions. But wait, the priority list is a permutation of all other students. So when the captain selects two students, they must be the first two available students in his priority list. However, the available students are those not yet in any team. So, the captain's priority list must have his two teammates as the first two in his list among the remaining students. But since the teams are formed in the given order, once a team is formed, those three are no longer available.

So the approach to find the priority list for k is to consider the order in which the teams were formed and how k's selection of teammates (if he was a captain) must fit into that.

But wait, k could be a captain or a member chosen by another captain. So first, we need to determine in which team k is present, and whether he is the captain of that team.

So first, let's process all the teams to find out which team contains k. Once we have that team, we can figure out if k is the captain. If he is, then his two teammates are the two he selected, so the priority list must include them in the earliest possible positions. Otherwise, he was selected by another captain, so his priority list must not affect the team selection (since he was chosen by someone else).

But how to model the priority list for k?

The lex smallest possible permutation is the one that is as small as possible in lex order. To achieve this, the earliest possible elements in the list should be as small as possible. However, this must be compatible with the team formation.

So, for k's priority list, the order must be such that when k was a captain, the two teammates he selected were the earliest possible in his priority list. If he wasn't a captain, then his priority list must not influence the team formation (since others chose him). But the problem is to find the lex smallest possible list that is compatible with the given team arrangement.

Wait, the priority list is a permutation of all other students. So the lex smallest list for k would be the earliest possible permutation in lex order that is compatible with the team formation process.

Let me think of this step by step. For each student in the priority list, we need to arrange them in lex order, but considering the constraints from the team formation.

So first, let's find out whether k is a captain in his team. Let's process each team in the order they were formed, and for each team, determine the captain (the highest-ranked student in the team according to the initial permutation). For k's team, if he is the captain, then his two teammates must be the first two available students in his priority list. However, when the team was formed, the available students were all those not yet in any team. So the two teammates must appear before any other available students in his priority list.

Alternatively, if k is not a captain, then his priority list can be anything, but since we need the lex smallest possible, we can arrange the list in lex order except for constraints imposed by the process. Wait, but how does his priority list affect others? Actually, his priority list is only used if he becomes a captain, but if he was selected by someone else, his priority list isn't considered during team formation. Therefore, the only constraints on his priority list are:

1. If he was a captain (i.e., he is the highest in his team), then his two teammates must appear before any other students that were available when he was choosing. But other than that, his list can be as lex smallest as possible.

So the steps for solving this problem are:

1. For each team, determine the captain (the highest-ranked in the initial permutation).
2. Check if k is in any team. Then, check if k is the captain of that team. If yes, then the two teammates must be the first two in his priority list among the available students at that time. But how do we determine the available students at that time?
3. The available students when the team is formed are all students not yet assigned to a team. So, the order in which teams are formed matters. Each team's formation removes their members from the pool.

So, the order of processing is the order of the input teams. For each team, the captain is the highest-ranked remaining student. Then, the other two members are selected by the captain from the remaining students.

So, for k's priority list:

If k was a captain (in his team), then his priority list must have his two teammates as the first two available students in his list when he formed the team. Also, the rest of his list must be arranged in a way that the lex smallest possible is achieved, but considering the selection order.

If k was not a captain, then his priority list can be the lex smallest possible permutation (sorted order) of all other students, except that when he is chosen by another captain, the selection must follow that captain's priority list.

Wait, but for k's own priority list, the only constraints are those arising when he was a captain. Because when he is not a captain, his priority list doesn't affect the team formation. So, when k is not a captain, we can arrange his priority list in lex order, as there are no constraints. However, when he is a captain, we must ensure that his two teammates are the first two in his priority list among the available students at the time of selection.

So the first thing to do is to find out whether k is a captain.

Let's process all teams and find for each team the captain. Let's create a dictionary that maps each student to their team, and whether they are a captain.

Once we know whether k is a captain, we can proceed.

Case 1: k is not a captain.

In this case, his priority list can be the lex smallest possible, which is simply all other students sorted in ascending order. Because there are no constraints on his priority list. Because he wasn't a captain, his priority list wasn't used to select anyone. So, the lex smallest possible list is the sorted list of all other students in increasing order.

But wait, the problem statement says that the priority list is a permutation of all other students. So, the lex smallest is indeed sorted in ascending order.

Case 2: k is a captain.

In this case, when he selected his two teammates, they must be the first two available students in his priority list. Additionally, the rest of his priority list must be lex smallest possible, but considering that the selection process may have constraints.

So the steps are:

- For the team where k is the captain, the two teammates are A and B.

- At the time k formed his team, the available students were all the students not yet in any team (including those in later teams? No, because teams are formed in the order given. So when k's team is formed, all teams up to his have been processed. Wait no. Wait, the order of the teams in the input is the order in which they were formed. So the first team in the input is the first formed, then the second, etc. So when processing the first team, all its members are removed from the pool. Then the second team is processed, etc.

So for k's team, when it's formed, the available students are all students not in any team processed before k's team.

So the two teammates in k's team must be the first two available students in his priority list. So in his priority list, these two must appear before any other students that were available at that time.

But what about the students that were already in previous teams? They were not available, so they can't appear in the part of the priority list that k used to select teammates. So in the priority list of k, the order of the students that were already in earlier teams can be anything, but since we need lex smallest, they can come after the teammates in the order.

But wait, the priority list is a permutation of all other students. So k's priority list must include all other 3n-1 students. But when he was selecting his team, some of them were already in previous teams and thus not available. So when he selected his teammates, those students (from previous teams) were not in the available pool. Therefore, in his priority list, the two teammates must be the first two available students (i.e., those not in any team formed before his). But the order in which they appear in his priority list must be such that the two are the first two available.

So for example, suppose when k is forming his team, the available students are S1, S2, ..., Sm. Then, his priority list must have his two teammates as the first two in the list, but only considering the available students. The other students (those already in teams) can appear anywhere else in the list.

So how to model this.

Let's first find the set of available students when k's team was formed.

To do this, we can process the teams in order. For each team before k's team, all their members are removed from the available pool. Then, when processing k's team, the available pool is the initial list minus all students from earlier teams.

Wait, the initial ranking is a permutation of all 3n students. The process is: while there are students not in any team, pick the highest ranked (according to the initial permutation) remaining student as captain. Then, the captain selects two teammates from the remaining students. So the team formation is done in the order of the input. So the first team in the input is the first team formed, which is when the highest-ranked student in the entire list (the first in the initial permutation) is the captain. Then, the next team is formed by the next highest-ranked remaining student, etc.

Wait, but the input's team list is the order in which the teams were formed, and each team in the input is formed by the next highest-ranked student. So the first team in the input must have the highest-ranked student (from the initial permutation) as its captain. The second team's captain is the next highest-ranked student in the initial permutation who is not in any previous team. So the initial permutation is the order of ranking. For each team in the input, the captain is the highest-ranked (earliest in the initial permutation) among the team's members. So to find the captain of each team, we can look at the team's members and pick the one with the earliest position in the initial permutation.

So, for each team in the input list, the captain is the student in the team with the highest rank (earliest in the initial permutation). So for the input team entries, we can process each team to determine the captain.

Once we have all the captains, we can process the teams in the order of formation (the input order), which corresponds to the order of their captains' ranks.

So, for the team that contains k:

- Determine if k is the captain (i.e., the highest-ranked in the team).

If k is not the captain, then his priority list can be the lex smallest possible, which is sorted order.

If he is the captain, then his priority list must have his two teammates as the first two available students in his list when he formed the team. The available students are those not in any team formed before his. The rest of the list can be arranged in lex order, but considering that the available students (those not in previous teams and not selected by him) may have been chosen by later captains.

Wait, but the rest of the priority list must be the lex smallest possible. So, after the two teammates, the priority list should have the remaining students in lex order, but with the following constraints:

- The students already in previous teams can be placed anywhere after the two teammates, but since we need lex smallest, they would come first in the list.

Wait, but when forming the priority list, the lex smallest is achieved by having the smallest possible elements first.

But the priority list must include all other students (3n-1 of them). For the lex smallest list, all the students not required to be first (the two teammates) should be arranged in ascending order. But the two teammates must be the first two in the list, but only among the available students.

So for the case when k is a captain:

The available students at the time of his selection are all students not in any team formed before his. So, the teammates must be the first two in his priority list among these available students. The rest of the available students (those not chosen) can appear in any order, but to get the lex smallest list, they should be arranged in ascending order. Additionally, the students that were already in previous teams can be placed anywhere in the priority list after the two teammates, but to get the lex smallest, they should be placed in ascending order as well.

Wait, the problem is that the priority list is a full permutation of all other students. So the two teammates must be the first two in the list (if they are available at the time). But if there are students in previous teams, they are not available and thus must appear in the priority list after the two teammates. Because when the captain (k) is choosing, those students are already part of earlier teams and thus not available. But in his priority list, he includes all other students. So in his priority list, the two teammates (selected by him) must be the first two available students in his list. The available students are those not in earlier teams.

But in the priority list, the order of the non-available students (those in earlier teams) can be arbitrary, but since we want lex smallest, they should appear as early as possible in the list, except that they can't be before the two teammates.

Wait, but the two teammates are the first two available students in his priority list. So in his list, the two teammates must come before any other available students. However, the non-available students (those in previous teams) can be placed anywhere else in the list. But since the priority list is a permutation of all other students, including those in previous teams, the non-available students can be placed either before or after the teammates. Wait, no. Because during the selection process, those non-available students (already in previous teams) are not available. So when the captain (k) is selecting, he can only select from the available students (those not in any previous team). Therefore, in his priority list, the two teammates must be the first two available students (i.e., the first two in his list that are available at that time). The other available students can be in any order after that. But the non-available students (those in previous teams) are not part of the available pool, so their positions in k's priority list don't affect the selection. So the captain's priority list includes all students except himself, but when he selects, he ignores those already in teams and picks the first two in his list that are available.

Therefore, for the lex smallest priority list, the two teammates must be the first two available students (i.e., those not in previous teams) in his list. The remaining available students can be ordered in the list in such a way that their order is lex smallest. Additionally, the non-available students (those in previous teams) can be placed in the list in such a way that the entire list is lex smallest.

But how?

So the approach is:

For k's priority list (when he is a captain):

1. The first two positions must be his two teammates, but ordered in such a way that they appear first in the list, and in lex order. Wait, no. Because the captain's priority list could have the two teammates in any order as long as they are the first two available. But since we need the lex smallest possible list, we should arrange them in the order that is lex smallest. So if the two teammates are a and b, then in the priority list, the one with the smaller number comes first.

Wait, but the captain could have selected them in either order. For example, if a and b are the two teammates, the captain's priority list could have a followed by b, or b followed by a, but in the selection, the first two available in the list are a and b. So the order of a and b in the priority list would determine which one comes first. However, for the lex smallest list, a and b should be ordered in ascending order.

But wait, the problem statement requires that the lex smallest priority list is chosen. So among all possible valid priority lists, we need to choose the lex smallest one. So for the two teammates, they should appear in the list in the earliest possible positions. But also, their order between them should be the smallest possible. For example, if the two are 5 and 6, then 5 comes before 6 in the list.

So, the first two elements in the priority list (after considering the non-available students) should be the two teammates in sorted order. But the non-available students (those in previous teams) can be placed in the priority list in any order, but to get the lex smallest list, they should be in the earliest possible positions. However, since the captain is selecting from the available students, the non-available students (those in previous teams) can be placed anywhere in the list except before the two teammates. Wait, no. Because when the captain is forming his team, the non-available students (those in previous teams) are not in the available pool. Therefore, the captain's priority list can have those non-available students anywhere, but during selection, they are skipped. So the captain's list includes all other students except himself, but when he's choosing, he picks the first two in his list that are available (i.e., not in previous teams).

So for the lex smallest priority list, the two teammates must be the first two available students in the list, ordered in the lex order (ascending). The non-available students can be placed anywhere else in the list, but since the lex smallest list is desired, we should arrange the non-available students first in the list (since they have smaller numbers). However, this is conflicting with the fact that the two teammates must be the first two available in the list.

Wait, no. Let's think of it this way: The available students for k are those not in any team formed before his team. The non-available students are those in previous teams. So, in k's priority list, the two teammates must appear before any other available students. But the non-available students can be placed anywhere. So for lex smallest, the priority list should have all non-available students (those in previous teams) ordered first, followed by the two teammates (ordered in ascending order), followed by the remaining available students (ordered in ascending order). But this is not possible if the non-available students are allowed to be placed anywhere else.

Wait, the priority list is a permutation of all other students. So for example, suppose some of the non-available students (previous teams) have numbers smaller than the two teammates. Then, placing those non-available students before the teammates in the priority list would make the list lex smaller, but since during selection, the captain skips those non-available students (since they are not available), the first two available students (teammates) are the first ones in the list that are available.

So in the priority list, the order can be:

non-available students in lex order, then the two teammates in lex order, then the rest of the available students in lex order. But this way, the non-available students are ordered first in the priority list, which would make the overall list lex smallest possible.

But how does this work?

Let's take an example. Suppose k is the captain of his team, and the available students at the time are 5,6,7,8. His teammates are 5 and 6. The non-available students (from previous teams) are 1,2,3,4. Then, the lex smallest priority list would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But the available students are 5,6,7,8, so the first two available in the priority list are 5 and 6, which are the teammates. So this is valid, and the list is lex smallest.

Alternatively, if the non-available students are 3,4, the available are 5,6,7,8. Then the lex smallest list is 3,4,5,6,7,8. But during selection, the first two available (5 and6) are chosen. So this works.

But another example: suppose non-available students are 2,4, and the available are 1,3,5. The teammates are 1 and3. Then the lex smallest list would be 2,4,1,3,5. Because the first two available are 1 and3. But in this case, the list starts with 2,4 (non-available), then the teammates. So the list is lex smallest.

So, the approach is:

- For the two teammates, they must be the first two available students in k's priority list.

- The non-available students (from previous teams) can be placed anywhere in the priority list, but to get lex order, they should be placed first in their lex order.

- The available students (those not in previous teams) are ordered in such a way that the two teammates come first (in lex order), followed by the other available students in lex order.

So, the steps for building the priority list when k is a captain are:

1. Collect all students not in any team formed before k's team (available at that time).

2. The two teammates (A and B) must be the first two in the priority list among the available students. So in the priority list, their order is the lex order (A < B).

3. The non-available students (those in teams formed before k's team) are arranged in lex order first, then the two teammates, then the remaining available students (those not chosen) in lex order.

Wait, but this would interleave non-available and available students. But the non-available students can be placed anywhere except that the two teammates must be the first two in the available subset.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

The priority list should consist of three parts:

a) All non-available students (from previous teams) sorted in lex order.

b) The two teammates sorted in lex order.

c) The remaining available students (available at the time of selection, but not selected) sorted in lex order.

So the entire priority list is a concatenation of a, followed by b, followed by c.

This would give the lex smallest possible list, as all non-available students are placed first (since they have smaller numbers, assuming that previous teams are formed from higher-ranked students). Then the two teammates in lex order, then the remaining available in lex order.

But why can't some of the non-available students appear after the teammates?

Because the lex order requires that the earliest possible elements are as small as possible. For example, if some non-available students have smaller numbers than the teammates, placing them first would make the list lex smaller.

So, the steps are:

If k is a captain:

1. Determine the team members (A, B, k).

Wait, no. The team members are three, including k. The captain is k, the other two are the teammates. So the two teammates are the two other members of the team.

So, for k's team, the two teammates are the other two members.

2. Collect all students in teams formed before k's team (non-available at the time of selection).

3. Collect the available students at the time of selection: all students not in any team formed before k's team, and not yet assigned.

But since the team is formed in the order of the input, the available students for k's team are those not in any team that comes before k's team in the input.

So, to find which students are in previous teams, we can iterate through all teams before k's team and collect their members.

4. The available students when k forms his team are those not in any previous team and not himself.

So, the available students are the union of the members of his team and the members of all teams formed after his. But no, because when forming his team, the available students are all students not in any previous team (including those in later teams, but he can't select them because they are not available yet? Wait, no. The teams are formed in order. So, when forming k's team, the available students are those not in any team formed before. So the available students include those in later teams (because they have not been formed yet). So when k is forming his team, the available students are all students not in any team formed before (including those in his own team and those in later teams). Because the previous teams are the ones formed before k's team. So, the available students for k's team are all students in the input not present in any team that comes before his.

So, the available students for k's team are:

all_students - (students in teams before k's team) - {k}.

Wait, because when forming the team, the captain (k) is already chosen, so he is removed from the available pool. So the available students are those not in previous teams, and not k.

So, to find the available students when k is forming his team:

available = all_students - (students in teams before k's team) - {k}

The two teammates are the two other members of k's team, which must be part of the available students.

So, the two teammates must be the first two in k's priority list among the available students.

So, to build the priority list for k:

The lex smallest list would be:

sorted non-available students (those in previous teams) + [teammate1, teammate2 sorted in ascending order] + sorted remaining available students (excluding the two teammates and k).

But the non-available students are those in previous teams. So, when building the priority list, the non-available students can be placed anywhere in the list. However, to get lex smallest, they should be placed first. Then, the teammates, then the remaining available students in sorted order.

So, the priority list is:

sorted(non_available) + [sorted_teammates] + sorted(remaining_available)

But how to determine the sorted_teammates and remaining_available.

The sorted_teammates are the two teammates ordered in ascending order.

The remaining_available are the available students (from when k formed his team) minus the two teammates.

So, the steps for the captain case are:

- Find all non_available students (those in teams before k's team).

- Find the available students: all_students - non_available - {k}

- The two teammates are the other two in k's team.

- The non_available list is sorted in ascending order.

- The sorted_teammates = sorted([t1, t2]).

- The remaining_available = sorted(available - {t1, t2}).

- The priority list is non_available + sorted_teammates + remaining_available.

Yes, that would give the lex smallest possible list.

So, putting it all together.

Now, how to implement this.

First, process the input:

Read n.

Read the initial permutation, which is a list of 3n students. Note that the order is their ranking: the first element is the highest-ranked, then next, etc.

Read the next n lines, each representing a team. For each team, determine the captain (the member with the earliest position in the initial permutation).

We need to build a data structure that maps each student to their team, and also track the order of the teams (so which team was formed first, second, etc.).

We can process the teams in the order they are given in the input. For each team, we determine the captain (the student with the earliest index in the initial permutation's order).

We can create a list of teams, each represented as a tuple (captain, team members).

But first, we need to map each student to their position in the initial permutation. Let's create a dictionary pos where pos[s] is the index in the initial permutation list. Lower index means higher rank.

Once we have that, for each team, iterate through its three members to find the one with the smallest pos value. That's the captain.

Once all teams are processed, for each student, we can know which team they belong to, and whether they are a captain.

Once we find the team that contains k, we check if k is the captain. If not, output all other students in sorted order.

If k is the captain, proceed as follows:

1. Collect all students in previous teams (those teams formed before k's team). The order of the teams in the input is the order of formation, so k's team is in the list of all teams. We need to find which index in the list.

So, for each team in the input list, we can track which students are in which team, and the order of the teams.

Once we find the index of k's team (let's call it team_index), the previous teams are all teams before team_index in the input list.

The students in previous teams are the union of the members of all teams before team_index.

So, non_available = set of all students in teams before team_index.

available = all_students (excluding k) minus non_available.

The two teammates are the other two members in k's team.

So, sorted_teammates = sorted(teammates).

remaining_available = available - set(teammates).

These remaining_available are sorted in ascending order.

The non_available students are sorted in ascending order.

The priority list is:

sorted(non_available) + sorted_teammates + sorted(remaining_available)

So, in code:

For example, in the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

3

5 4 1 2 6 3 7 8 9

5 6 2

9 3 4

1 7 8

4

So, the initial permutation is [5,4,1,2,6,3,7,8,9]

The teams are:

Team 1: 5,6,2 → their positions in initial permutation are 5 is at index 0 (since initial permutation is 5,4,1,2,6,3,7,8,9), so 5 is the first element. 6 is at index 4. 2 is at index 3. So the captain is 5.

Team 2: 9,3,4 → initial permutation is 9 is at index 8. 3 is at index 5. 4 is at index 1. So the captain is 4 (since 4 is at index 1, which is the smallest among the three). Wait, no. Wait, the initial permutation is [5,4,1,2,6,3,7,8,9], so the positions of the students in the permutation are:

student 5 → index 0 (highest rank)

student 4 → index 1

student 1 → index 2

student 2 → index 3

student 6 → index 4

student 3 → index 5

student 7 → index 6

student 8 → index 7

student 9 → index 8.

So for the second team (9,3,4):

pos[9] = 8, pos[3] =5, pos[4] =1. So the captain is 4 (smallest pos is 1). So the second team's captain is 4.

Third team: 1,7,8. Their positions are 1 → index 2, 7 →6, 8→7. So captain is 1.

The student k is 4. So 4 is in the second team, and is the captain. So the available students when he formed his team are all students not in the first team (5,6,2) and not 4.

The available students are:

all_students = {5,4,1,2,6,3,7,8,9} → subtract first team (5,6,2), subtract 4. So available is {1,3,7,8,9}.

The two teammates are 9 and3 (since the team is 9,3,4. So teammates are 9 and3.

sorted_teammates would be [3,9].

non_available students are those in the first team (5,6,2). sorted(non_available) → [2,5,6].

remaining_available is available - teammates. available is {1,3,7,8,9} minus {3,9} → {1,7,8}. sorted → [1,7,8].

So the priority list is [2,5,6] + [3,9] + [1,7,8] → concatenated gives 2 5 6 3 9 1 7 8. But the sample output is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8. So my reasoning is incorrect here.

Wait, the sample output is:

2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8

Wait, this suggests that the non_available are 5,6,2 (from the first team). So sorted(non_available) is [2,5,6]. Then the teammates are 3 and9. So sorted_teammates are [3,9]. Then remaining_available is [1,7,8,9]? Wait, no. The available students after removing the first team and k (4) are {1,3,7,8,9}. Teammates are 3 and9. So remaining_available is {1,7,8}, sorted as [1,7,8].

So the priority list should be [2,5,6,3,9,1,7,8], but the sample output is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8.

So there's a discrepancy. What's wrong here?

Ah! Wait, in the sample input, the team is 9,3,4. So the two teammates are 9 and3. So sorted_teammates is [3,9]. So the priority list should start with the non_available sorted [2,5,6], followed by [3,9], then the remaining available [1,7,8]. So the list would be 2 5 6 3 9 1 7 8. But the sample output is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8.

So this suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.

What's wrong?

Ah! I see. The available students when k (4) is forming his team include the teammates (3 and9), but the other available students are 1,7,8. So the remaining_available after selecting the teammates is 1,7,8.

But according to the sample output, the priority list is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8.

So the non_available students are 5,6,2 (from the first team). So sorted(non_available) is 2,5,6. Then the teammates are 3 and9. Then the remaining_available are 1,7,8.

But according to the sample output, after 2 comes 3, then 5,6,9, etc. So this suggests that the non_available are not all placed first. So what's wrong with my approach?

Ah, perhaps the non_available students are those not in previous teams. Wait, but the first team is the one before the second team (k's team). So the non_available students are in the first team. But why in the sample output, the non_available are ordered 2, then 3 (which is a teammate, so part of available students), then 5 and 6.

This suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the non_available students are those in the previous teams (teams formed before k's team), but the available students include teammates and others.

Wait, the available students when k is forming his team are all students not in previous teams and not himself. So the available students are:

all_students (5,4,1,2,6,3,7,8,9) minus previous teams (first team: 5,6,2) minus k (4) → available is {1,3,7,8,9}.

The two teammates are 3 and9. So in k's priority list, the first two available students are 3 and9. But how do they appear in the priority list.

Ah, perhaps the non_available students are those in previous teams. So they are in the first team: 5,6,2.

The available students are 1,3,7,8,9.

The priority list must be such that 3 and9 are the first two available students in the list, but the non_available students can be placed anywhere in the list except between them.

But the lex smallest list would arrange the non_available students first, then the teammates in lex order, then the remaining available students in lex order.

So the non_available students are 2,5,6. Sorted → 2,5,6.

Teammates sorted →3,9.

Remaining available sorted →1,7,8.

So the list would be 2 5 6 3 9 1 7 8 → which is 8 elements. But the sample output is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8. So this is different.

So my approach gives a different result than the sample. Therefore, there's a flaw in the reasoning.

What's the sample's correct approach?

In the sample input, the priority list for k=4 is 2 3 5 6 9 1 7 8.

So the list starts with 2 (non_available), then 3 (teammate), then 5 (non_available), 6 (non_available), then 9 (teammate), then 1,7,8 (remaining available).

But according to the reasoning, the non_available should come first, followed by the teammates and then the remaining available. But in the sample output, the non_available are ordered 2,5,6, and then the teammates. But in the actual output, the order is 2,3,5,6,9, etc.

So, the teammates are interleaved with non_available students.

Ah, this indicates that the non_available students are not necessarily placed first. So why?

Because the non_available students are those in previous teams, and during the selection, the captain's priority list is processed. For example, if the priority list has non_available students followed by available, then the first two available students are chosen. However, if the priority list has available students interleaved with non_available, then the first two available students in the list are chosen.

So, the non_available students can be placed anywhere in the list, as long as the two teammates are the first two available in the list.

But to find the lex smallest possible list, how to arrange the non_available and available students such that the two teammates are first in the available subset and the entire list is lex smallest.

The key is that the non_available students can appear anywhere in the list, but the two teammates must be the first two available in the list. However, to make the entire list lex smallest, we need to arrange the list such that the earliest possible elements are as small as possible.

For example, if there is a non_available student with a small number, it should be placed early in the list, even before the teammates, as long as the two teammates are the first two available in the list.

Wait, but the two teammates must be the first two available in the list. So if the non_available students are placed before the teammates in the list, but the teammates are the first available in the list, then it's acceptable.

For example, the list could be [non_available1, teammate1, non_available2, teammate2, ...], as long as the teammates are the first two available.

So in the sample input, the priority list starts with 2 (non_available), then 3 (teammate), then 5 (non_available), 6 (non_available), 9 (teammate), then others.

So the first two available students in the list are 3 and 9. Because non_available students are not available.

So, the list can have non_available and available students interleaved, but the first two available students must be the teammates.

The lex smallest possible list is achieved by placing the smallest possible elements first, with the constraint that the two teammates are the first two available.

So how to model this.

The approach is:

- The two teammates must be the first two available students in the priority list.

- The rest of the list must be lex smallest possible.

So, the list is constructed in such a way that:

For all positions in the priority list, the earliest possible elements are chosen, with the constraint that the first two available students in the list are the teammates, in order.

So, the problem is similar to constructing the lex smallest permutation with the constraint that the first two available students (when processed in order) are the two teammates.

The available students are those not in previous teams.

So, the algorithm is:

1. Generate all students except k. For each student, determine whether they are in a previous team (non_available) or available.

2. The priority list must be a permutation of these students.

3. The two teammates must be the first two available students in the list.

4. Among all such permutations, choose the lex smallest one.

The key is to find the lex smallest permutation where the first two available students are the two teammates (in any order?), but since we need lex smallest, we choose their order to be sorted.

But how to construct this.

This problem is similar to generating the lex smallest permutation with certain elements appearing first in the available subset.

An efficient way to approach this is:

The priority list must be the lex smallest possible, with the two teammates as the first two available students. The available students are those not in previous teams.

So, the first available student in the list is the smallest possible (which would be the first teammate, say t1), and the second available is the next smallest (t2). But since the two teammates must be chosen, they must be the first two in the available subset.

So, the lex smallest list is constructed by:

- Placing the two teammates as the first two available students in the list, in sorted order.

- For the remaining positions, arrange the students in lex order, but ensuring that any available students not chosen are ordered after the two teammates.

But how to interleave non_available students and others to achieve lex smallest.

The correct approach is to build the list in such a way that:

- All students are considered in order, but whenever a student is available, the first two available must be the teammates.

So, the algorithm could be:

- The first two available students in the list must be t1 and t2, sorted.

- The other available students can be in any order, but to make the list lex smallest, they should be ordered in ascending order.

- The non_available students can be placed anywhere in the list, but to make the list lex smallest, they should be placed as early as possible.

But how to interleave them.

This seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

The idea is to construct the list step by step, choosing the smallest possible student at each position, subject to the constraint that when the available students are considered, the first two are the teammates.

But this is quite complex.

Alternative approach:

The lex smallest permutation is the one where we greedily choose the smallest possible student at each step, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.

The constraint is that in the list, the first two available students (i.e., the first two students in the list that are not in previous teams) must be the two teammates, in sorted order.

So, during the construction of the priority list, whenever we reach a position where the remaining students include available students that haven't been placed yet, the first two available students in the list must be the two teammates.

But this seems complicated.

Alternative idea: the priority list must be such that the two teammates are the earliest available students in the list, and the rest of the list is as small as possible.

So, the first available student in the list must be the smaller of the two teammates, and the second available must be the larger.

The remaining available students must be in sorted order.

The non_available students can be placed anywhere else in the list, but to make the list lex smallest, they should be placed as early as possible.

So the priority list can be built as follows:

1. Collect all students except k.

2. Separate them into non_available (from previous teams) and available.

3. The available students are those not in previous teams.

4. The available students must include the two teammates, and the remaining available students (if any).

5. The two teammates must be the first two available students in the list, in sorted order.

6. The rest of the list must be the lex smallest possible.

So, the available students are: sorted_teammates + sorted_remaining_available.

The non_available students can be placed anywhere in the list, but to make the lex smallest list, we need to merge the non_available and available lists in a way that the overall list is lex smallest.

But how?

The lex smallest list is formed by merging the non_available and the available lists into a single sorted list, but with the constraint that the available list's first two elements are the teammates.

Wait, but the available list must start with the two teammates, followed by the remaining available in sorted order. So the available list is [t1, t2] + sorted_remaining_available.

The non_available list is sorted.

Then, the priority list is the merge of the non_available and available lists, such that the overall list is lex smallest possible, but the available list's first two elements are the first two available in the merged list.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach:

The priority list can be viewed as a combination of non_available and available students. But the available students' first two must be the teammates.

To get the lex smallest list, the non_available students are sorted, and the available students are sorted with the teammates first.

Then, the entire list is the lex smallest possible by merging the non_available and available students, but ensuring that the teammates are the first two available.

But how to merge them.

For example, the non_available students are sorted, and the available students are sorted with teammates first.

The merged list is the sorted combination, but this may not work.

Alternatively, the priority list is a merged list of the non_available and available students, but whenever an available student is encountered, the first two must be the teammates.

But this is not straightforward.

Perhaps the correct way is to construct the list as follows:

The list will contain all non_available students and available students. The available students must be arranged such that the first two are the teammates in sorted order, followed by the rest in sorted order. The non_available students can be interleaved with the available students in any way, but the overall list must be lex smallest.

So, the problem reduces to interleaving two sorted lists (non_available and available) in a way that the available list's first two elements are the first two available in the interleaved list, and the overall list is lex smallest.

This is similar to merging two sorted lists, but with constraints.

In this case, the two lists are:

non_available: sorted in ascending order.

available: [t1, t2] + sorted_remaining_available.

We need to merge them into a single list such that the first two available students in the merged list are t1 and t2.

But the merged list must be lex smallest possible.

How to do this.

The merged list must be lex smallest, so we want to take the smallest possible element from either list at each step. However, when an available student is taken, we need to ensure that the first two available students in the merged list are t1 and t2.

But how to model this.

Wait, the available students have two required elements (t1, t2) which must be the first two in the merged list's available subset. So, t1 must appear in the merged list before any other available student, and t2 must appear before any other available student except t1.

But the non_available students can appear anywhere.

So, the merging process must ensure that whenever an available student is added to the merged list, it must be either t1, then t2, and then the rest.

So the merged list is constructed as follows:

- We can take any non_available student as long as they are smaller than the next available student.

- But once we start taking available students, we must first take t1 and t2 in order, then the rest in sorted order.

So, the merged list is formed by:

1. All non_available students that are smaller than t1. These can be placed before t1.

2. Then t1.

3. Any remaining non_available students that are smaller than t2. These can be placed after t1 but before t2.

4. Then t2.

5. The remaining non_available and available students (sorted_remaining_available) can be merged in sorted order.

But this is just a hypothesis.

Alternatively, the merged list is the lex smallest permutation that starts with all non_available students less than t1, followed by t1, then non_available students less than t2, then t2, then the remaining elements in sorted order.

But how to implement this.

Let's take the sample input.

non_available students are 2,5,6 (sorted as 2,5,6).

available students are t1=3, t2=9, then sorted_remaining_available is 1,7,8.

The merged list should be the lex smallest possible, with 3 and 9 as the first two available students.

So, the lex smallest possible list is:

2 (non_available), 3 (available), 5 (non_available),6 (non_available),9 (available),1,7,8.

Which matches the sample output.

This list starts with non_available 2, then available 3, which is the first available. Then non_available 5 and 6, then available 9. The remaining available students are 1,7,8, which are added in sorted order.

So, the merging process is to take the non_available students first as long as they are smaller than t1. Then, take t1. Then take non_available students that are smaller than t2, then take t2. Then merge the remaining non_available and available in sorted order.

Let's see:

t1=3, t2=9.

non_available sorted: 2,5,6.

available sorted_remaining: 1,7,8.

Steps:

1. Take non_available students smaller than t1 (3). The non_available students are 2,5,6. 2 is smaller than 3. Take 2.

Now, merged list: [2]

Next, non_available has 5,6. 5 is larger than t1 (3), so can't take anymore non_available before t1. So take t1 (3).

 merged list: [2,3]

Now, take non_available students smaller than t2 (9). The non_available students left are 5,6. Both are smaller than 9. Take them in sorted order.

 merged list: [2,3,5,6]

Then take t2 (9).

 merged list: [2,3,5,6,9]

Then merge the remaining non_available (none left) and available_remaining (1,7,8) in sorted order. Available_remaining sorted is 1,7,8.

 merged list: [2,3,5,6,9,1,7,8]

But this is not lex smallest, because after 9, the next element is 1, which is smaller than 7 and 8. So the list becomes 2,3,5,6,9,1,7,8.

But lex order requires that after 9, 1 is considered. However, this is correct.

But why isn't the merged list the sorted combination of non_available and available?

Because the available list has elements like 1, which is smaller than 9. But according to the merging process, the available_remaining is added after the t2. So, after t2, we add the available_remaining in sorted order, but the non_available may have been exhausted.

But in this case, the available_remaining are 1,7,8, which are sorted. So adding them as is.

So the final list is correct.

But how to model this merging process.

The algorithm for merging is:

1. Collect all non_available students in sorted order.

2. Collect the available students in the order [t1, t2] + sorted_remaining_available.

3. Merge the non_available and available lists into a single list, choosing at each step the smallest possible element from the heads of the two lists.

But with the constraint that available list must have t1 and t2 as the first two available students.

Wait, but available list is already ordered as [t1, t2, ...], so when merging with non_available, which is also sorted, the merged list is the same as the merge of two sorted lists.

For example, non_available = [2,5,6], available = [3,9,1,7,8]. But available is not sorted. Wait, no. available is [t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available]. sorted_remaining_available is [1,7,8], so available is [3,9,1,7,8] → which is not sorted. So merging non_available (sorted) and available (not sorted) will not work.

So this approach is flawed.

Ah, right. The available list is [t1, t2] followed by sorted_remaining_available. But that part is not sorted. For example, sorted_remaining_available is [1,7,8], so available list is [3,9,1,7,8]. Which is not sorted. So merging with non_available in a sorted way would not work.

So this approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: the available list must be [t1, t2] followed by sorted_remaining_available. So in the sample input, the available list is [3,9,1,7,8], which is not sorted. Thus, when merging with non_available (sorted), we have to interleave them to get the lex smallest list.

But how to do this.

This is a classic problem of merging two sorted lists into one sorted list. However, the available list is not sorted, so this approach won't work.

Wait, but the available list is not sorted. The available list has t1, t2, then sorted_remaining_available. So the sorted_remaining_available part is sorted. But the available list as a whole is [t1, t2] + sorted_remaining_available, which may not be sorted.

So the available list's first two elements are t1 and t2 (sorted), and the rest are sorted.

But the rest may be smaller than t2. For example, if sorted_remaining_available contains elements smaller than t2.

So, the available list is not sorted. Thus, merging with non_available is not straightforward.

So, the correct approach must be:

The merged list must contain all non_available and available students, ordered such that:

- The available students' first two are t1 and t2.

- The entire list is lex smallest possible.

But how to construct this.

This seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach, choosing the smallest possible element from the remaining candidates at each step, while ensuring that the two teammates are selected as the first two available students.

Let's think of the algorithm:

Initialize two pointers, i for non_available (sorted) and j for available (sorted_teammates + sorted_remaining_available).

Wait, but the available list is not sorted. So, perhaps we can split the available list into three parts:

- t1, t2 (sorted)

- sorted_remaining_available.

So, the available list is [t1, t2] + sorted_remaining_available.

But the sorted_remaining_available is sorted.

So, the available list starts with t1 and t2, then the rest are sorted.

So the available list is not sorted, but the first two elements are sorted, and the rest are sorted.

So, the available list can be divided into two parts: the first two elements (t1 and t2, ordered), and the rest (sorted_remaining_available, ordered).

But how to merge this with the non_available list, which is sorted.

The idea is to merge the non_available list and the available list, but ensuring that the first two available elements are taken as t1 and t2, and the remaining available elements are taken in sorted order.

This seems complex.

Alternative idea: process the priority list in order, and at each step choose the smallest possible next element from either non_available or available, but ensure that the two available teammates are chosen when the available list is processed.

But this requires tracking whether we have already selected the two teammates.

Let's model this with a state machine:

We need to select the entire list of 3n-1 students (all except k).

The list must be such that the first two available students (i.e., those not in non_available) are the two teammates, in sorted order.

The algorithm steps:

1. Separate all students except k into non_available and available.

2. Sort non_available in ascending order.

3. Sort available into a list that starts with t1, t2 (sorted), followed by sorted_remaining_available.

4. Merge the non_available and available lists into a single list, taking the smallest possible element at each step, but ensuring that when an available student is taken, the first two available are t1 and t2.

But how to ensure this.

Another approach: the available list must be such that in the merged list, the first two available students (those not in non_available) are t1 and t2. So, the merged list must have t1 and t2 appear in the earliest possible positions in the available subset.

So, in the merged list, any available student (other than t1 and t2) must appear after t1 and t2.

So, the merged list is constructed by:

- All elements from non_available and available, ordered in a way that the merged list is lex smallest.

- But with the constraint that in the available subset, t1 and t2 are first and second.

So, the merged list is built as follows:

- The elements are chosen in lex order, with the following constraint: if the next element is available and not one of the two teammates, it can only be chosen after both t1 and t2 have been chosen.

So, the algorithm can be:

1. Create two lists: non_available_sorted and available_sorted (available_sorted is [t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available]).

2. Merge the two lists by selecting the smallest possible element at each step.

3. However, when selecting from available_sorted, after choosing t1 and t2, the remaining available elements can be merged in sorted order.

Wait, but the available_sorted list is not sorted. For example, sorted_remaining_available may contain elements smaller than t2.

But the available_sorted list starts with t1, t2 (sorted), then sorted_remaining_available. So the available_sorted list is not necessarily sorted.

So, merging the non_available_sorted and available_sorted lists would not produce a sorted merged list.

So, this approach won't work.

Another idea: the available students are t1, t2, and the rest, but the rest are sorted. So, after t1 and t2, the rest are in sorted order. So the available list is [t1, t2, ... (sorted)].

The merged list is the lex smallest possible list where the available students are ordered such that t1 and t2 are first.

This is challenging.

Perhaps the correct way is to greedily choose the smallest possible element from either the non_available list or the available list, ensuring that the available list's first two elements are selected before any other available elements.

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize pointers for non_available (i=0), and available (j=0). The available list is [t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available].

We also need to track whether we have already selected t1 and t2.

Initially, selected_t1 = False, selected_t2 = False.

At each step:

- If we can choose a student from non_available and that student is smaller than the current available candidate:

   - If non_available[i] is smaller than available[j], choose it. Increment i.

- Else:

   - If we haven't selected t1 yet, select available[j] (t1), then j increments to 1 (t2).

   - Else if we have selected t1 but not t2, select available[j] (t2), then j increments to 2.

   - Else, select the smallest available student from the remaining available (which are sorted_remaining_available) and non_available.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, once t1 and t2 have been selected, the remaining available students are sorted, and can be merged with the remaining non_available students.

This seems manageable.

Let's break the problem into parts:

1. Select elements from non_available and available lists until both t1 and t2 are selected.

2. After both are selected, merge the remaining non_available and available (sorted_remaining_available) in sorted order.

So, step 1:

We have two sorted lists:

non_available_sorted: sorted in ascending order.

available_ordered: [t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available_sorted].

We need to merge these two lists, but ensuring that t1 is selected before any other available students (except possibly non_available students), and t2 is selected before any other available students except t1 and non_available students.

So during step 1, until both t1 and t2 are selected:

At each step:

- The next element is the minimum between non_available_sorted[i] and available_ordered[j], but:

   - If available_ordered[j] is t1, and we haven't selected t1 yet, we must select it when it is the smallest.

   - Similarly for t2.

But this requires tracking whether t1 and t2 have been selected.

Let's model this with code:

i = 0 (index for non_available_sorted)

j = 0 (index for available_ordered)

selected_t1 = False

selected_t2 = False

result = []

while i < len(non_available_sorted) or j < len(available_ordered):

   if i < len(non_available_sorted) and j < len(available_ordered):

       if non_available_sorted[i] < available_ordered[j]:

           result.append(non_available_sorted[i])

           i += 1

       else:

           if j == 0 and not selected_t1:

               result.append(available_ordered[j])

               j += 1

               selected_t1 = True

           elif j == 1 and not selected_t2:

               result.append(available_ordered[j])

               j += 1

               selected_t2 = True

           else:

               # This part is not possible during step 1.

               # Because j is in available_ordered, which is t1, t2, sorted_remaining.

               # So j can be 0 (t1), 1 (t2), or >=2 (sorted_remaining).

               # During step 1, j can't be >=2 unless t1 and t2 are already selected.

               pass

   elif i < len(non_available_sorted):

       result.append(non_available_sorted[i])

       i += 1

   else:

       # must pick from available_ordered.

       if j == 0 and not selected_t1:

           result.append(available_ordered[j])

           j += 1

           selected_t1 = True

       elif j == 1 and not selected_t2:

           result.append(available_ordered[j])

           j += 1

           selected_t2 = True

       else:

           # this part is for when non_available is exhausted and we have to pick t1 and t2.

           pass

But this code is not complete and may have errors.

Alternatively, once both t1 and t2 are selected, the remaining available students are sorted_remaining_available_sorted, and we can merge the remaining non_available_sorted and sorted_remaining_available_sorted.

So, the steps are:

1. Merge non_available_sorted and available_ordered (t1, t2, ...) until t1 and t2 are selected.

   During this phase, at each step, choose the smallest possible element.

   However, once t1 and/or t2 are selected, update j accordingly.

2. After t1 and t2 are selected, merge the remaining non_available_sorted and sorted_remaining_available_sorted into the result.

Let's try this approach with the sample input.

non_available_sorted = [2,5,6]

available_ordered = [3,9,1,7,8]

sorted_remaining_available_sorted = [1,7,8]

Step 1:

Initially, i=0, j=0, selected_t1=False, selected_t2=False.

Compare non_available_sorted[i=0] = 2 with available_ordered[j=0] =3. 2 <3. So select 2. i becomes 1.

Now, i=1 (5), j=0.

Compare 5 <3? No. So must select available_ordered[j=0] =3 (t1). selected_t1 becomes True. j increments to 1 (9).

Now, i=1 (5), j=1 (9). Compare 5 <9. Yes. Select 5. i becomes 2 (6). 

Now, i=2 (6), j=1 (9). 6<9. Select 6. i becomes 3. non_available_sorted is exhausted.

Now, selected_t1 is True, selected_t2 is False. j=1 (9). Must select 9 (t2). selected_t2 becomes True. j increments to 2 (1).

Now, step 1 is done. The merged list so far is [2,3,5,6,9].

Step 2: merge the remaining non_available_sorted (exhausted) and sorted_remaining_available_sorted [1,7,8].

So append 1,7,8.

Final list: [2,3,5,6,9,1,7,8], which matches the sample output.

Yes! This works.

So, the algorithm is:

1. Process the non_available_sorted and available_ordered (t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available) by merging them, selecting the smallest possible element at each step until both t1 and t2 are selected.

2. Once t1 and t2 are selected, merge the remaining non_available_sorted and sorted_remaining_available_sorted (which is a sorted list) into the result.

But how to implement this.

Let's outline the code steps:

When k is a captain:

non_available = students in teams formed before k's team.

available_students = students not in non_available and not k.

teammates = the other two members of k's team.

sorted_teammates = sorted(teammates) → t1, t2.

remaining_available = sorted(available_students - set(teammates)).

available_ordered = [t1, t2] + remaining_available.

non_available_sorted = sorted(non_available).

merged_list = []

i = 0 (pointer to non_available_sorted)

j = 0 (pointer to available_ordered)

selected_t1 = False

selected_t2 = False

while i < len(non_available_sorted) or j < len(available_ordered):

   if selected_t1 and selected_t2:

       break

   if i < len(non_available_sorted) and j < len(available_ordered):

       if non_available_sorted[i] < available_ordered[j]:

           merged_list.append(non_available_sorted[i])

           i += 1

       else:

           if j == 0:

               merged_list.append(available_ordered[j])

               j += 1

               selected_t1 = True

           elif j == 1:

               merged_list.append(available_ordered[j])

               j += 1

               selected_t2 = True

   elif i < len(non_available_sorted):

       merged_list.append(non_available_sorted[i])

       i += 1

   else:

       if j == 0:

           merged_list.append(available_ordered[j])

           j += 1

           selected_t1 = True

       else:

           merged_list.append(available_ordered[j])

           j += 1

           selected_t2 = True

# Now, merge the remaining non_available_sorted and remaining_available_sorted.

remaining_non_available = non_available_sorted[i:]

remaining_available = available_ordered[j:]

merged_remaining = []

p = 0

q = 0

while p < len(remaining_non_available) and q < len(remaining_available):

   if remaining_non_available[p] < remaining_available[q]:

       merged_remaining.append(remaining_non_available[p])

       p += 1

   else:

       merged_remaining.append(remaining_available[q])

       q += 1

merged_remaining += remaining_non_available[p:]

merged_remaining += remaining_available[q:]

merged_list += merged_remaining

This would give the merged_list as required.

But need to make sure that the remaining_available is sorted. Because available_ordered[j:] is the remaining_available, which is sorted_remaining_available_sorted (as it's part of available_ordered).

Yes, because available_ordered is [t1, t2, sorted_remaining_available_sorted], so after j exceeds 1, the remaining is sorted_remaining_available_sorted, which is sorted.

So, the code would work.

Now, let's test this algorithm with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

non_available_sorted = [2,5,6]

available_ordered = [3,9,1,7,8]

The code first processes the non_available and available_ordered until both t1 (3) and t2 (9) are selected.

The steps:

i=0, j=0: 2 <3 → append 2, i=1.

i=1, j=0: 5 vs 3 → 5>3. So append 3, j=1, selected_t1=True.

i=1, j=1: 5 <9 → append 5, i=2.

i=2, j=1: 6 <9 → append 6, i=3.

Now, non_available_sorted is exhausted. j=1 (9).

selected_t1 is True, selected_t2 is False.

Append 9, j=2, selected_t2=True.

Now, merged_list is [2,3,5,6,9].

Now, remaining_non_available is non_available_sorted[i=3:], which is empty.

remaining_available is available_ordered[j=2:], which is [1,7,8].

merged_remaining is merged sorted of [] and [1,7,8], which is [1,7,8].

So merged_list becomes [2,3,5,6,9,1,7,8], which matches the sample output.

Yes.

Another sample input:

Sample Input 2:

3

5 4 1 2 6 3 7 8 9

5 6 2

9 3 4

1 7 8

8

The student k is 8. Let's see.

First, find which team k is in.

The teams are:

Team 1: 5,6,2 → captain is 5.

Team 2: 9,3,4 → captain is4.

Team 3: 1,7,8 → captain is1.

k=8 is in team 3. The captain is1. So k is not a captain. So his priority list is all other students sorted in ascending order.

The other students are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9.

Sorted gives 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9. Which matches the sample output.

Yes.

Sample Input 3:

2

4 1 3 2 5 6

4 6 5

1 2 3

4

The initial permutation is [4,1,3,2,5,6].

Teams:

Team 1:4,6,5 → captain is4 (position 0).

Team 2:1,2,3 → captain is1 (position1 in initial permutation).

k=4 is in team 1. He is the captain. His teammates are 6 and5.

non_available students are those in teams before team 1. Since team1 is the first team, non_available is empty.

available students are all except team1 and k (4). So available students are 1,2,3.

Teammates are 6 and5. So sorted_teammates are [5,6].

remaining_available = available_students - {5,6} → available_students is 1,2,3. So remaining_available is 1,2,3. sorted.

available_ordered = [5,6] + [1,2,3].

non_available_sorted is empty.

merged_list is processed as follows:

i=0 (non_available_sorted is empty), j=0 (available_ordered is [5,6,1,2,3]).

Since selected_t1 and selected_t2 are False:

We must select 5 (t1), then 6 (t2).

merged_list becomes [5,6].

Then, merge remaining non_available (empty) and remaining_available (1,2,3).

merged_list += [1,2,3].

So the priority list is 5,6,1,2,3. But the sample output is 5 6 1 2 3.

Wait, the sample output is 5 6 1 2 3. Which matches.

Yes.

So this approach works.

Now, implementing this in code.

First, read the input:

n = int(input())

ranking = list(map(int, input().split()))

teams = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

k = int(input())

We need to process each team to find the captain.

First, create a pos dictionary: pos[student] = index in the ranking.

pos = {student: idx for idx, student in enumerate(ranking)}

Then, for each team in the input, determine the captain (the member with the smallest pos value).

captain_indices = []

team_list = []

student_to_team = {}  # maps student to their team index.

for team in teams:

    # determine captain in team.

    captain = min(team, key=lambda x: pos[x])

    captain_indices.append(captain)

    team_list.append(team)

    for s in team:

        student_to_team[s] = len(team_list) - 1  # team index is 0-based.

So, team_list is the list of teams in order. student_to_team maps each student to their team's index.

Now, find which team contains k.

team_index = student_to_team.get(k)

if team_index is None:

    # should not happen.

    pass

team = team_list[team_index]

captain = captain_indices[team_index]

if k != captain:

    # output all other students sorted.

    others = sorted(s for s in ranking if s != k)

    print(' '.join(map(str, others)))

else:

    # k is captain.

    # find the teammates.

    teammates = [s for s in team if s != k]

    t1, t2 = sorted(teammates)

    # find previous teams: all teams before team_index.

    previous_teams = team_list[:team_index]

    # non_available = students in previous teams.

    non_available = []

    for t in previous_teams:

        non_available.extend(t)

    # available_students = all students not in previous teams and not k.

    all_students = set(ranking)

    available_students = all_students - set(non_available) - {k}

    # remaining_available = available_students - {t1, t2}

    remaining_available = sorted(available_students - {t1, t2})

    # available_ordered = [t1, t2] + remaining_available

    available_ordered = [t1, t2] + remaining_available

    # non_available_sorted = sorted(non_available)

    non_available_sorted = sorted(non_available)

    # merge the non_available_sorted and available_ordered until t1 and t2 are selected.

    merged = []

    i = 0  # pointer to non_available_sorted

    j = 0  # pointer to available_ordered

    selected_t1 = False

    selected_t2 = False

    # process until both t1 and t2 are selected.

    while i < len(non_available_sorted) or j < len(available_ordered):

        if selected_t1 and selected_t2:

            break

        if i < len(non_available_sorted) and j < len(available_ordered):

            if non_available_sorted[i] < available_ordered[j]:

                merged.append(non_available_sorted[i])

                i += 1

            else:

                if j == 0:

                    merged.append(available_ordered[j])

                    j += 1

                    selected_t1 = True

                elif j == 1:

                    merged.append(available_ordered[j])

                    j += 1

                    selected_t2 = True

        elif i < len(non_available_sorted):

            merged.append(non_available_sorted[i])

            i += 1

        else:

            # must pick from available_ordered.

            if j == 0:

                merged.append(available_ordered[j])

                j += 1

                selected_t1 = True

            else:

                merged.append(available_ordered[j])

                j += 1

                selected_t2 = True

    # now, merge the remaining non_available_sorted and available_ordered[j:]

    remaining_non_available = non_available_sorted[i:]

    remaining_available = available_ordered[j:]

    # merge the two sorted lists.

    merged_remaining = []

    p = 0

    q = 0

    while p < len(remaining_non_available) and q < len(remaining_available):

        if remaining_non_available[p] < remaining_available[q]:

            merged_remaining.append(remaining_non_available[p])

            p += 1

        else:

            merged_remaining.append(remaining_available[q])

            q += 1

    merged_remaining.extend(remaining_non_available[p:])

    merged_remaining.extend(remaining_available[q:])

    merged += merged_remaining

    print(' '.join(map(str, merged)))

This should handle all cases.

Sample Input 3:

2

4 1 3 2 5 6

4 6 5

1 2 3

4

k=4 is in team 0. Captain is4.

teammates are6 and5 → sorted as5 and6.

non_available is teams before team0 → none.

available_students = all_students (4,1,3,2,5,6) minus non_available (empty) and 4 → available_students are1,2,3,5,6.

teammates are5 and6 → available_students - {5,6} is 1,2,3.

available_ordered is [5,6,1,2,3].

non_available_sorted is empty.

merged list:

i=0, j=0.

Since non_available_sorted is empty, must pick from available_ordered.

j=0: append5, j=1, selected_t1=True.

j=1: append6, j=2, selected_t2=True.

remaining_non_available is empty.

remaining_available is available_ordered[2:] → [1,2,3].

merged_remaining is [1,2,3].

merged list is [5,6,1,2,3], which matches sample output.

Thus, the code works.
