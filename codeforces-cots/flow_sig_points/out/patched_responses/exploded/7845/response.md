Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if the given string s can be split into k palindromic substrings of equal length. Hmm. So first, I need to check if the total length of s is divisible by k. Because if it's not, then there's no way to split it into k parts of equal length. So the first step is to check if len(s) mod k equals zero. If not, return NO immediately.

Right. So, for example, in the first sample input, s is "saba" with length 4. k is 2. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So each part should be 2 characters. Then each of those 2 parts must be a palindrome. Let's see: "sa" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not. So output is NO. That's why the first sample gives NO.

In the second sample, the string is "saddastavvat" which has length 12. k is 2, so each part must be 6 characters. The two parts would be "saddas" and "tavvat". Both are palindromes. So YES.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the length of s is divisible by k. If not, output NO.
2. If yes, split the string into k parts, each of length (n/k).
3. Check each part to see if it's a palindrome.
4. If all are palindromes, output YES; else, NO.

Now, how to implement this efficiently?

First, n is up to 1000, k up to 1000. So for the worst case, when k is 1, we need to check if the entire string is a palindrome. That's O(n) time.

But when k is 1000, then each part is of length 1. Since any single character is a palindrome. So in that case, it's automatically YES. Wait, but wait: if k is 1000, but the length of s is 1000, then each part is 1 character. So yes. But if the length is 999, then 999 is not divisible by 1000, so first check fails. So in cases where each part is of length 1, then it's automatically yes (since each single character is a palindrome).

So, the steps are:

Check if len(s) % k != 0 â†’ return NO.

Else, m = len(s)/k.

Then split s into k parts each of length m.

For each part, check if it's a palindrome.

If all are palindromes â†’ YES, else NO.

So, the code structure would be:

Read s and k.

Compute n = len(s). If n % k != 0 â†’ print NO.

Else, m = n // k.

For i in 0 to k-1:

   part = s[i*m : (i+1)*m]

   check if part is a palindrome.

   if any part is not, return NO.

Else, return YES.

So the main part is checking each substring for being a palindrome.

How to check if a string is a palindrome? The straightforward way is to compare the string with its reverse.

Like, part == part[::-1].

That's O(m) time for each check. For each of the k parts, O(m) per check. Total O(k*m) = O(n) time, which is acceptable because n is up to 1000. So for the worst case, 1000 operations, which is okay.

So the code steps are manageable.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: k=1. Then the entire string must be a palindrome. So code should check that.

Edge case 2: m=1. So each part is a single character. Then all are palindromes. So return YES as long as the length is divisible by k.

Another example: if s is "a", k=1 â†’ YES. If s is "ab", k=2 â†’ each part is a and b â†’ both are palindromes â†’ YES.

Wait, but "ab" is split into "a" and "b", both are palindromes. So the code would output YES.

Another example: s is "aaab", k=2. Then len(s) is 4, m=2. The two parts would be "aa" and "ab". The first is a palindrome, the second is not. So output NO.

So the code handles these cases.

So the plan is solid.

Now, code in Python:

Read s, then k.

n = len(s)

if n % k != 0 â†’ print NO.

Else:

m = n //k

for each i in 0 to k-1:

   start = i * m

   end = start + m

   substr = s[start:end]

   if substr != substr[::-1]:

       print NO and exit.

If all are okay, print YES.

That's straightforward.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    k = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    n = len(s)
    if n % k != 0:
        print("NO", file=output_stream)
    else:
        m = n // k
        possible = True
        for i in range(k):
            part = s[i*m : (i+1)*m]
            if part != part[::-1]:
                possible = False
                break
        print("YES" if possible else "NO", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
saddastavvat
2
""",
            "output": \
"""\
YES
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Sample 2:

s = 'saddastavvat' â†’ len 12, k=2 â†’ m=6.

First part: 'saddas' â†’ reversed 'saddas' â†’ same â†’ yes.

Second part: 'tavvat' â†’ reversed 'tavvat' â†’ same â†’ yes. So output YES.

Another test case: s = 'a', k=1 â†’ YES.

s = 'ab', k=2 â†’ YES.

s = 'ab', k=1 â†’ check 'ab' â†’ no â†’ output NO.

All these cases handled.

So code should work.

```python
s = input().strip()
k = int(input())
n = len(s)
if n % k != 0:
    print("NO")
else:
    m = n // k
    possible = True
    for i in range(k):
        part = s[i*m : (i+1)*m]
        if part != part[::-1]:
            possible = False
            break
    print("YES" if possible else "NO")
```
