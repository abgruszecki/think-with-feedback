Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of subarrays of a given permutation that are Decinc. A Decinc array is one where you can remove a decreasing subsequence (possibly empty) to make the remaining array increasing. Hmm.

So, the key is to determine for each possible subarray [l..r] whether it satisfies this condition. Since n can be up to 2e5, a brute force approach checking each possible subarray is definitely out of the question. We need a smarter way.

First, let's understand what makes a subarray Decinc. When we remove a decreasing subsequence from it, the remaining elements should form an increasing sequence. So, the original array must have a structure where the elements not in the decreasing subsequence form an increasing sequence. Wait, but the remaining elements after removing a decreasing subsequence can be in any order as long as the result is increasing. Wait no, the elements not removed must form an increasing sequence. So, the idea is that the array can be partitioned into an increasing sequence and a decreasing subsequence. Because when you remove a decreasing subsequence, the rest must be increasing.

Alternatively, maybe the array itself must be such that the maximum possible increasing sequence plus some decreasing parts. But how do we model this?

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that the array is split into two parts: one that is increasing (the part we keep) and the other that is a decreasing subsequence (the part we remove). The important point is that the kept elements must form an increasing sequence, and the removed elements must form a decreasing subsequence. Also, the order of the elements in the original array must allow for this. Since the permutation is given, each element is unique.

Another approach: For a subarray to be Decinc, there must exist a way to split the elements into two sets: the increasing part (A) and the decreasing part (D), such that D is a decreasing subsequence. So, the elements in A must form an increasing sequence when considered in their original order, and the elements in D must form a decreasing subsequence. Also, since D is a subsequence, their positions must be in decreasing order. Wait, no. D is a subsequence that is removed, so the elements in D can be any subset that forms a decreasing sequence, but their positions must be such that their indices in the original array are in decreasing order. Wait, but the elements of D must form a decreasing subsequence of the original array. So, their positions in the subarray must be in order such that each next element in D comes after the previous one in the subarray. Wait, no, the elements in D must form a decreasing subsequence. So in the subarray [l..r], the elements of D must appear in positions that are in order, but each subsequent element in D must come before (since subsequence can be non-consecutive, but the order in the array is preserved). Wait, no. For example, if D is [a1, a4], then a1 is before a4 in the array, but the subsequence is in the order a1, a4, but their values must be decreasing. So in the example given, the D elements are a1=3 and a4=1, which are decreasing.

So, the problem reduces to finding all subarrays where there exists a split into an increasing sequence (A) and a decreasing subsequence (D). The elements of A must form an increasing sequence in the order they appear, and the elements of D must form a decreasing subsequence in the order they appear in the array.

How can we model this for a given subarray? Let's think of the structure of such a subarray. For the elements in A to be increasing, the sequence must not have any decreases except possibly for elements that are in D. But D elements form a decreasing subsequence. So, for example, if in the original array, there's a peak followed by a valley that's not part of the increasing sequence, then perhaps those elements are part of D.

Alternatively, maybe the Decinc condition can be rephrased as follows: The entire array, when considering the elements not in D, is increasing. But D can be any decreasing subsequence.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be characterized by the array having a certain structure where after removing certain elements (in a decreasing order), the remaining elements are increasing. So the array can be partitioned into an increasing sequence and a decreasing subsequence. The key here is that the elements not in the decreasing subsequence form an increasing sequence.

Now, the challenge is to find all subarrays [l..r] where such a partition exists.

An important observation here is that since the array is a permutation, all elements are unique.

Let me think about the structure of a valid Decinc subarray. Let's suppose that the array [l..r] has elements that can be split into A (increasing) and D (decreasing). The elements in A must form an increasing sequence. So, for any two elements a_i and a_j in A, if i < j in the array, then a_i < a_j. For the elements in D, they must form a decreasing sequence. So, if i < j in the array and both are in D, then D's elements must be in decreasing order.

But how do these two sets interact? For example, suppose there's an element in A that is followed by an element in D. The D element can be smaller or larger than the previous A elements. But since the D elements are a subsequence that is decreasing, each new D element must be smaller than the previous one in D.

Wait, perhaps the Decinc arrays can be characterized by the following: The array must have a non-decreasing subsequence that covers all elements except for a decreasing subsequence. So, the array can be split into an increasing sequence and a decreasing subsequence, but the increasing sequence is a subsequence that forms the entire array except for the decreasing parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the Decinc condition is equivalent to the array having an increasing subsequence such that the elements not in this subsequence form a decreasing subsequence.

Yes, that's exactly the condition. Because when you remove a decreasing subsequence (D), the remaining elements (A) must form an increasing sequence. So the problem reduces to checking if a subarray can be split into two such subsequences.

Now, how to model this. For a given subarray, we need to check if such a split exists.

But checking this for every possible subarray directly is O(n^2), which is impossible for n=2e5.

So, we need a way to efficiently compute the number of valid subarrays. Let's think of possible properties that a valid subarray must have, and find a way to count all such subarrays.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find for each position the maximum possible r where the subarray [l..r] is valid, and then accumulate these counts.

But how to find those maximum r's.

Another approach: The valid subarrays must satisfy that the maximum element in the subarray is part of the increasing sequence A. Or perhaps not. Let's think.

Alternatively, think of the elements in A and D. The elements in A must form an increasing sequence, and D a decreasing. So, for the entire subarray, the elements can be partitioned into A and D, such that:

- All elements in A are in increasing order (as per their order in the array).

- All elements in D are in decreasing order (as per their order in the array).

But how can we model this for the entire subarray?

Another observation: Since the entire array is a permutation, all elements are distinct, so comparisons are strict.

Let me try to find some necessary conditions for a subarray to be Decinc.

Suppose that in the subarray [l..r], the elements can be partitioned into A and D as described. Then:

- The elements in A must form an increasing sequence.

- The elements in D must form a decreasing sequence.

Moreover, the elements in A and D must be arranged in the array such that any element in D that is between two elements of A (i.e., in the array, there are elements a_i and a_j in A, with i < k < j, and a_k is in D) must be less than both a_i and a_j. Because otherwise, if a_k is in D and is larger than a_i, but then the next a_j must be larger than a_i, but a_k is part of D and must be part of a decreasing sequence.

Wait, perhaps that's not necessarily true. For example, if D has elements that are in between elements of A, but their values are such that the D sequence is decreasing.

But maybe this is leading us into a complicated analysis. Let's think of the structure of the subarray.

Let's consider the elements of A as those that form the increasing sequence. Then, any element not in A (i.e., in D) must form a decreasing sequence. But since D is a subsequence of the original subarray, the elements in D must appear in the same order as they appear in the subarray, but their values must be in decreasing order.

Wait, no. The elements of D must form a decreasing sequence in the order they appear in the subarray. For example, if D is a subsequence, then the elements must appear in the order they are in the subarray, but their values must be in decreasing order.

Wait, the elements in D are a subsequence, which means their positions are in increasing order (since a subsequence is formed by elements that appear in order, but not necessarily consecutively). So, in the subarray, the elements of D are in the same order as they appear in the subarray. But their values must be in decreasing order. So, if we have D elements at positions i_1, i_2, ..., i_k (i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k) in the subarray, then p[i_1] > p[i_2] > ... > p[i_k].

So, the D elements form a decreasing subsequence of the subarray. The A elements form an increasing subsequence of the subarray, and the union of A and D is the entire subarray.

So, the problem reduces to checking whether a given subarray can be partitioned into an increasing subsequence (A) and a decreasing subsequence (D), where A and D are disjoint and cover all elements.

Hmm, but how do these two sequences interact? For example, an element in A can be between two elements of D, but as long as the A sequence is increasing and the D sequence is decreasing.

But how can we model this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: The subarray is Decinc if and only if the entire subarray can be covered by two sequences: one increasing and one decreasing. But this is not exactly the same as the problem's condition. Wait, the problem says that we can remove a decreasing subsequence (D) and the remaining elements (A) are increasing. So A is the entire subarray minus D, and D is a decreasing subsequence. So the problem is equivalent to A being increasing and D being a decreasing subsequence, with A and D partitioning the subarray.

Thus, the problem can be rephrased as checking for the existence of such a partition.

Now, the key question is: What is the structure of such a subarray?

Let's think of the maximum possible elements in A and D. Since A is increasing and D is decreasing, perhaps the elements of A form the longest possible increasing subsequence (LIS), but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the partition into A and D is such that A is as large as possible, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for a subarray to be Decinc, there exists a way to split the elements into A and D such that:

- All elements in A form an increasing sequence.

- All elements in D form a decreasing sequence.

But how can we model this?

Let's consider the entire subarray. Let's say that the elements of A are ordered as x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_k, and the elements of D are ordered as y_1 > y_2 > ... > y_m.

Now, the elements in A can be in any positions as long as their order is increasing. The elements in D can be in any positions as long as their order is decreasing.

But how do these two sequences interact? For example, if there's an element in D that is between two elements of A, but is larger than the previous A element and smaller than the next A element. Would that violate the D's decreasing sequence?

Not necessarily. For example, suppose A is [2,4,5] and D is [3,1]. Then the original array could be [2,3,4,1,5]. Here, D is [3,1], which is a decreasing subsequence. The remaining elements are [2,4,5], which is increasing.

So the key is that the elements of D can be interspersed with elements of A, as long as their own sequence is decreasing.

But how can we model this for a subarray?

An alternative approach: Let's model the possible partitions for each position. For each index i in the subarray, we can track the possible candidates for the last element in A and D. But with n being 2e5, this approach would be too slow.

Another idea: Let's find for each position i the possible maximum and minimum values in the subarray, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, let's think of the entire subarray. The elements of A form an increasing sequence, and the elements of D form a decreasing sequence. The union of these two must be the entire subarray.

So, for the entire subarray, if the union of an increasing sequence and a decreasing sequence covers all elements, then it's Decinc.

But how can we check this efficiently?

Another observation: For any valid subarray, there must be a way to split the elements into A and D. So, perhaps the elements in the subarray must not contain three elements that form a "peak" not covered by A or D. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, think about the structure of the subarray. The elements must have a structure where any element not in the increasing sequence can be part of a decreasing sequence. For example, if there's an element that is larger than the next element in A, but smaller than the previous element in A, then it's possible to include it in D if there's a way to form a decreasing sequence.

Wait, maybe the following holds: The subarray is Decinc if and only if there exists a way to split it into two sequences, one increasing and the other decreasing, such that their union is the entire subarray. But how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire subarray can be viewed as consisting of an increasing sequence, but with some elements removed (the D sequence) which form a decreasing subsequence. So, the problem is equivalent to checking if the subarray can be viewed as an increasing sequence with some (possibly zero) elements removed, and the removed elements form a decreasing subsequence.

But how to model that. For example, the increasing sequence A must be a subset of the elements, and the remaining elements (D) must form a decreasing subsequence.

But how can we model this for a given subarray?

Another approach is to model the problem for each possible subarray. For each possible l and r, we need to check if the subarray p[l..r] can be split into A and D as described. But for n=2e5, there are O(n^2) possible subarrays, so this is not feasible.

Thus, we need a way to compute this in linear or linearithmic time.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this using dynamic programming. For each position i, we can track some information about the possible A and D sequences that end at i. Then, as we process each element, we can update this information.

But I'm not sure. Let's think deeper.

Suppose we have a subarray that starts at l and ends at r. Let's consider the elements from l to r. For this to be Decinc, there must exist a way to split them into A and D as required.

Let's consider the possible ways to include p[r] in the split. Either p[r] is part of A or part of D.

If p[r] is in A, then the elements before r in the subarray must form a Decinc array where the A sequence ends with a value less than p[r]. Additionally, the D sequence can have any elements as long as they form a decreasing subsequence.

Alternatively, if p[r] is in D, then the elements before r in the subarray must form a Decinc array where the D sequence ends with a value greater than p[r], and the A sequence is such that the remaining elements (after including p[r] in D) form an increasing sequence.

But this approach might not capture all possibilities, especially since the split can vary as we extend the subarray.

Alternatively, for each position i, we can track the possible maximum and minimum values of the A and D sequences. For example, for the A sequence, the last element must be the maximum of the A sequence. For the D sequence, the last element must be the minimum (since D is decreasing, the last element in D is the smallest).

Wait, perhaps not. The D sequence is a decreasing subsequence. So each new element in D must be smaller than the previous one. So the last element in D is the smallest. For the A sequence, each new element must be larger than the previous one, so the last element in A is the largest.

Thus, for a given subarray ending at i, the possible options are:

- The subarray can be split into A and D, where the last element is in A. Then, the last element of A is the maximum of the entire subarray.

- The last element is in D. Then, the last element of D is the minimum of the entire subarray.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example. Suppose the subarray is [3,2,4]. Then, the split could be A = [3,4], D = [2]. The last element of A is 4 (max), and the last element of D is 2 (min of D). Now, the maximum of the entire subarray is 4, which is the last element of A.

Another example: subarray [5,4,3,2,1]. Then, the split would be A is empty, D is the entire array. So the last element of D is 1, which is the min. But the maximum of the entire subarray is 5, which is in D.

Hmm, so the earlier idea that the maximum of the subarray is part of A is not necessarily true. For instance, in this example, the entire subarray is D, which is a decreasing sequence. So, the A is empty, and the max is part of D.

So that approach may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of the subarray must be part of either A or D. But that's obvious.

But how to use that.

Wait, but when the last element is part of A, then A's elements must be increasing, so the last element of A is the maximum of A. Similarly, when the last element is part of D, then D's elements are decreasing, so the last element of D is the minimum of D.

So, for a subarray ending at i, let's track two possibilities:

- The last element is in A. Then, the maximum value in A is p[i].

- The last element is in D. Then, the minimum value in D is p[i].

Then, when adding a new element (i+1) to the subarray, we can update these possibilities.

This seems like a dynamic programming approach where for each position, we track the possible states.

But how to model this.

Let's suppose that for a subarray [l..i], we track two variables:

- The maximum value in A (if the last element is in A).

- The minimum value in D (if the last element is in D).

But how do we track these for all possible starting points l? That's challenging.

Alternatively, for each i, track the ranges of possible maximum A and minimum D values for the subarrays ending at i.

But this might be manageable.

Let me think. For each position i, we can track the possible ways that a subarray ending at i can be split into A and D. For each such way, we need to know:

- If the last element is in A: the maximum value of A (which is p[i]).

- If the last element is in D: the minimum value of D (which is p[i]).

Then, for the next element (i+1), we can consider adding it to A or D and check the conditions.

But how to model this for all possible starting points.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, we can track the earliest possible starting point l where the subarray [l..i] is Decinc, given certain constraints on the maximum A or minimum D.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to find for each position i, the set of possible starting points l such that the subarray [l..i] is Decinc. Then, the total count is the sum over all i of the number of such l's.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Let's think of the problem for the entire array. Each subarray [l..r] is Decinc if and only if there exists a split into A and D as described.

So, for a given r, we want to find all l's such that [l..r] is Decinc.

If we can, for each r, compute the number of valid l's, then summing over r gives the answer.

The challenge is to compute this efficiently.

So, let's focus on r. We need to find all l's <= r such that [l..r] is Decinc.

Now, let's model the possible conditions that the elements from l to r must satisfy.

Suppose that for the subarray [l..r], the elements can be split into A and D. Then, for each possible split, there are two possibilities for the last element (r):

Case 1: r is in A. Then, the elements of A up to r must form an increasing sequence. So, the last element of A (which is r) must be larger than the previous element in A. Also, the previous elements in A must form an increasing sequence. Moreover, the elements in D up to r-1 must form a decreasing sequence.

But since the entire subarray up to r is [l..r], the split for [l..r-1] must also be valid. So, perhaps for r in A, the maximum A value in the previous split must be less than p[r].

Case 2: r is in D. Then, the elements of D up to r must form a decreasing sequence. So, the previous element in D must be larger than p[r]. The elements in A up to r-1 must form an increasing sequence, and their maximum must be less than any elements in A.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for the split of [l..r] into A and D, when the last element is in A:

- The elements in A up to r must be increasing. So, the previous element in A (if any) must be less than p[r].

- The elements in D up to r must form a decreasing sequence. But since the last element is in A, the D sequence is up to r-1, and must form a decreasing sequence.

Similarly, if the last element is in D:

- The D elements up to r must be decreasing. So, the previous element in D (if any) must be larger than p[r].

- The A elements up to r must form an increasing sequence, which is up to r-1, since the last element is in D.

So, perhaps the state for dynamic programming can track, for each position, the possible maximum value of A (if the last element is in A) and the minimum value of D (if the last element is in D). Then, for each new element, we can update these states.

Let's formalize this. For each position i, we can track:

- max_A: the maximum possible value in A when the subarray ends at i with the last element in A. This would be p[i], since the last element is in A and A is increasing.

- min_D: the minimum possible value in D when the subarray ends at i with the last element in D. This would be p[i], since D is decreasing.

Then, for each i, we can track the possible transitions from the previous positions.

For example, when processing i, we can consider two possibilities:

1. The last element (i) is in A. Then, the previous elements must form a split where either the last element was in A (and the previous A's max is less than p[i]) or the last element was in D (and the previous D's min can be anything, since the new A element is added, and the D elements are from before).

Wait, but if the previous split ends in A or D, adding the new element to A would require that the previous A's max is less than p[i]. However, if the previous split ends in D, then the new element can be added to A as long as it's larger than all elements in A so far.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's model this more carefully.

Suppose we are processing position i. We can consider two possibilities for the subarrays ending at i:

a) The subarray ends with i in A. Then, the elements before i (if any) must form a Decinc subarray, and the last element in A (if any) must be less than p[i]. Moreover, the elements in D for the previous part must form a decreasing subsequence. But how do we track that.

Alternatively, maybe for each position i, we can track the maximum possible value of A (when ending in A) and the minimum possible value of D (when ending in D) for the longest possible subarray ending at i.

Let me think. For example, let's define for each i:

- a: the maximum possible value of A's last element when the subarray ending at i is split with i in A.

- d: the minimum possible value of D's last element when the subarray ending at i is split with i in D.

Then, for each i, these values can be computed based on the previous values.

Case 1: i is in A.

In this case, the previous element in the subarray (if any) must be in A or D. But since the subarray is contiguous, the previous element is i-1. Wait, no. Because the subarray is [l..i], so the previous elements could be any starting from l to i-1. But this approach would track the possible splits for subarrays ending at i. So, for each i, the possible splits are determined by the splits of subarrays ending at i-1.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the valid subarrays ending at i can be determined by extending valid subarrays ending at i-1.

So, for each i, we can track the possible transitions:

If a valid subarray ending at i-1 can be extended to include i by adding i to either A or D, depending on the conditions.

But how?

Let's suppose that for the subarray ending at i-1, the maximum A value is a_prev, and the minimum D value is d_prev.

Now, when adding i to the subarray, we have two options:

1. Add i to A. In this case, the new a is p[i], and we must have a_prev < p[i]. Also, the D sequence remains the same (since i is added to A, D's elements are those from before, which must form a decreasing subsequence).

Wait, but the D sequence must be a subsequence of the entire subarray. So, if the previous D was valid, adding i to A doesn't affect D. So, as long as the D sequence is already valid (i.e., it's a decreasing subsequence), then adding i to A is allowed if a_prev < p[i].

But this approach seems to ignore the possibility that the previous subarray may have ended in D, and adding i to A requires that the previous A (if any) is compatible with p[i].

Alternatively, perhaps for the subarray ending at i, the maximum a is the maximum possible a for any possible l such that [l..i] is valid and ends with i in A. Similarly for d.

Wait, but this seems unclear.

Alternatively, let's model the problem for a subarray ending at i, and track two possibilities: the subarray ends with i in A, or in D.

For each of these cases, we need to track the necessary information to extend the subarray.

Let's try to model this with dynamic programming. For each i, we'll track:

- The maximum possible value of A when the subarray ends with i in A. Let's call this a.

- The minimum possible value of D when the subarray ends with i in D. Let's call this d.

Additionally, for each i, we can track the earliest possible starting point l for which the subarray [l..i] is valid, given the current a or d.

Wait, maybe the following approach:

For each i, we can compute two variables:

- a: the smallest possible starting index l such that the subarray [l..i] can be split into A and D, ending with i in A, and the maximum of A is p[i].

- d: the smallest possible starting index l such that the subarray [l..i] can be split into A and D, ending with i in D, and the minimum of D is p[i].

Then, for the next i+1, we can check if adding it to A or D is possible based on the previous a and d.

But how to compute a and d for each i.

Alternatively, let's think recursively.

If the current element is added to A, then the previous elements must form a valid split where the last element in A is less than the current element. So:

If the previous subarray ends in A, then the a for the previous i must be less than p[i]. Then, the new a would be p[i], and the new starting index would be the same as the previous a's starting index.

If the previous subarray ends in D, then adding the current element to A would require that the previous A (if any) is less than p[i]. But how to track the previous A's maximum when the previous subarray ends in D.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum a for the current subarray ending in A is p[i], and the starting index l is the earliest possible l where the subarray [l..i] can be split into A (ending with p[i]) and D.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the problem of extending a valid subarray [l..i-1] to [l..i], we can check whether adding i to A or D is possible.

But again, with n=2e5, we need an O(n) solution.

Perhaps there's a pattern or a specific structure that valid subarrays must follow.

Let's look at the examples.

First example:

Input is 3 elements: 2 3 1. The output is 6, meaning all possible subarrays are valid.

Let's see:

All possible subarrays:

- [2] → valid (remove empty D).

- [2,3] → valid (remove empty D).

- [2,3,1] → valid. Remove D = [3,1] which is decreasing. Or remove D = [2,1], etc. The remaining elements [3] is increasing.

Wait, but wait. The subarray [2,3,1] can be split into A = [2,1] and D = [3] (but D must be a decreasing subsequence. [3] is decreasing. But A = [2,1] is not increasing. So that's not valid. So perhaps the correct split is A = [3,1], but that's not increasing. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait, the first example says that all subarrays are Decinc. For the subarray [2,3,1], the correct split must be possible. For example, the problem's first example says that the array [3,2,4,1,5] can be split into A = [2,4,5] and D = [3,1], which is valid.

So for the subarray [2,3,1], how is it valid? Let's see.

Possible splits:

- Remove D as [3], then A is [2,1], which is not increasing. So invalid.

- Remove D as [1], then A is [2,3], which is increasing. So valid. So the split is A = [2,3], D = [1]. D is a decreasing subsequence (single element). So yes.

So this subarray is valid. So the answer for all subarrays being valid is correct.

This suggests that the key is that there exists at least one split where A is increasing and D is decreasing.

So, even if there are elements that could form a split that doesn't work, as long as there exists one that does, the subarray is valid.

So, for the subarray [2,3,1], the split where D is [1] is valid. So the subarray is Decinc.

Thus, the problem is to find whether there exists at least one split into A and D.

Now, the question is how to model the existence of such a split for a given subarray.

Another observation: The subarray is Decinc if and only if the entire subarray can be split into two subsequences: A (increasing) and D (decreasing). So, the problem reduces to checking if the subarray is a union of an increasing and a decreasing subsequence.

But how to check this efficiently.

An alternative idea: The subarray is Decinc if and only if there is no three elements in the subarray that form a '3-2-1' pattern, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps if there exists a triple of indices i < j < k in the subarray such that p[i] > p[j] > p[k], then the subarray is not Decinc. No, that's not true. For example, the subarray [3,2,1] is Decinc because we can take D as the entire array (which is decreasing), so A is empty. Then, the remaining elements (empty) is increasing. So that subarray is valid.

So that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the subarray is Decinc if and only if it does not contain a 3-element increasing subsequence followed by a larger element. No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Decinc arrays are exactly the permutations that can be partitioned into an increasing and a decreasing subsequence. This is a well-known problem, but I'm not aware of a direct characterization.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming for each possible position, tracking the maximum possible A and minimum possible D.

Let me try to outline the DP approach.

For each index i, we can track two variables:

- a: the smallest possible starting index l such that the subarray [l..i] can be split into A and D, ending with i in A. Here, the maximum of A is p[i], and the elements in A are increasing.

- d: the smallest possible starting index l such that the subarray [l..i] can be split into A and D, ending with i in D. Here, the minimum of D is p[i], and the elements in D are decreasing.

For example, a[i] represents the earliest possible l where [l..i] is a Decinc subarray ending with i in A, and d[i] is the earliest possible l for ending in D.

Then, for each i, the valid starting positions l are those where l <= a[i] (for ending in A) or l <= d[i] (for ending in D), and the maximum of these gives the earliest possible l.

But how to compute a[i] and d[i] from previous values.

Let's think about how to compute a[i] and d[i].

For a[i]:

To have i in A, the previous element must be in A or D. However, the previous element in the subarray could be i-1, but the subarray is [l..i], so l can be varying.

Wait, perhaps the previous element in A is the last element of A before i. But since the subarray is contiguous, this would require that the previous element in A is part of the same subarray.

Alternatively, the idea is that for the subarray [l..i], the last element in A is i. The previous element in A must be in [l..i-1], and have a value less than p[i]. Similarly, the elements in D must form a decreasing subsequence, and the last element in D (if any) must be larger than p[i] (since i is in A).

Wait, no. The D elements can be anywhere in the subarray, but they must form a decreasing subsequence. But if the subarray [l..i] ends with i in A, then the D elements must form a decreasing sequence. The last element of D can be anywhere before i. But how to track this.

This seems complicated. Maybe we need to model for each position i, the possible maximum a and minimum d values.

Alternatively, let's think about how the Decinc condition can be expressed for a subarray. Let's suppose that the subarray has a maximum element. If this maximum is in A, then the elements in A up to this maximum form an increasing sequence. The remaining elements (after the maximum) can be part of A or D, but must not contain any elements larger than the maximum (since the maximum is already in A). So, after the maximum, all elements must be either part of A (and thus in increasing order) or part of D (in decreasing order).

But since the subarray is a permutation, there is only one maximum element.

Similarly, if the maximum is in D, then all elements after the maximum in the subarray must be part of D (since they must be smaller than the maximum, which is the first element in D's sequence). But this is only possible if the remaining elements form a decreasing subsequence.

Hmm, this seems like a promising direction. Let's consider the maximum element in the subarray. Since it's a permutation, the maximum is unique.

Case 1: The maximum is in A. Then, the elements to the left of the maximum must form a Decinc subarray where the last element in A is less than the maximum. The elements to the right of the maximum must form an increasing sequence (since they are part of A) or form a decreasing subsequence (part of D). But the elements to the right must all be part of either A (which requires increasing) or D (which requires decreasing). However, since the maximum is already in A, any elements after it in A must be larger than the previous A elements. But the maximum is the largest, so the elements after must be part of D.

Wait, no. If the maximum is in A, any elements after it in the subarray must be less than the maximum. So they can be part of D, which requires that they form a decreasing subsequence. Or they can be part of A, but since A must be increasing, the elements after the maximum must be in increasing order. But since the maximum is the largest, all elements after must be part of A and form an increasing sequence. But this is impossible if there's a decreasing sequence after the maximum.

Wait, perhaps this approach is leading us to the correct solution.

Let me think: the maximum element must be part of either A or D. Suppose it's part of A. Then, the elements before the maximum in the subarray must form a Decinc subarray. The elements after the maximum must form an increasing sequence (since they are part of A) but since the maximum is already in A, any elements after it in A must be larger than the maximum, which is impossible. So, the maximum cannot be part of A. Therefore, the maximum must be part of D.

But wait, that's a contradiction. Because in the example [3,2,4], the maximum is 4, which is part of A. So this suggests that the initial conclusion is wrong.

Hmm, this approach may not be viable.

Alternative approach inspired by the example:

The maximum element of the subarray must be in either A or D.

If it's in A, then all elements after it in the subarray must be part of D and form a decreasing subsequence. Because if any of them is in A, then since A is increasing, it must be larger than the maximum, which is impossible.

So, if the maximum is in A, then the elements after it must form a decreasing subsequence (all part of D). The elements before the maximum must form a Decinc subarray where the maximum of A is the previous maximum (before the current maximum). Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, let's model the subarray [l..r]. Let m be the position of the maximum element in this subarray. So p[m] is the maximum.

If the maximum is in A, then all elements after m must be part of D and form a decreasing subsequence. Also, the elements before m must form a Decinc subarray [l..m-1], where the maximum of A is less than p[m], and the D elements form a decreasing subsequence.

If the maximum is in D, then all elements before m must be part of D and form a decreasing subsequence greater than p[m], and the elements after m must form a Decinc subarray where the D elements are a decreasing subsequence.

But this seems like a recursive approach. For each subarray, the maximum element's position dictates how the subarray can be split into A and D.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This seems similar to the approach used in the problem of finding the number of valid subarrays in a permutation, which can be solved using a divide and conquer approach based on the maximum element. For example, in the problem of counting the number of contiguous subarrays that are permutation's, this approach is used.

In this case, perhaps for each subarray, the maximum element must be part of D. Because if it's part of A, then all elements after it must be in D and form a decreasing subsequence. But how can that be checked.

Alternatively, let's consider that the maximum element in the subarray must be part of D. Then, all elements to the left of it in the subarray must be in D and form a decreasing sequence leading up to the maximum. Then, the elements to the right must form a Decinc subarray where their maximum is also part of D and is smaller than the current maximum.

But this recursive approach might lead to an O(n log n) solution.

For example, the maximum of the entire array can be considered. Any subarray containing this maximum must have the maximum in D. Then, the left and right subarrays are processed recursively.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for a subarray [l..r], if the maximum element is at position m, then:

- The subarray [l..m-1] must be a Decinc subarray where the D sequence's last element is larger than p[m].

- The subarray [m+1..r] must be a Decinc subarray where the D sequence's elements are all smaller than p[m].

But I'm not sure.

This approach seems promising but requires further analysis.

For example, consider the subarray [3,2,4,1,5]. The maximum is 5. If it's in D, then the D sequence would have 5 as the first element, but the D sequence must be decreasing, which would require all elements before 5 in the subarray to be larger than 5, which is not possible. So this maximum must be in A. But earlier analysis said that when the maximum is in A, all elements after must be in D and form a decreasing sequence. In this case, after 5, there are no elements. So this is allowed.

So, the subarray [3,2,4,1,5] is valid because the maximum is in A (5) and there are no elements after it.

But if the subarray is [3,2,4,1], then the maximum is 4. If it's in A, then all elements after it (1) must be in D and form a decreasing sequence. Since 1 is a single element, it's a valid D. So the split is A = [3,4], D = [2,1]. The remaining elements after 4 are in D, which is decreasing. Thus, the subarray is valid.

But how to model this in code.

Perhaps the key is to find, for each possible subarray, the position of its maximum element and recursively check the left and right parts.

This suggests a divide and conquer approach based on the maximum element.

The steps would be:

For a given range [l..r], find the position m of the maximum element. Then, recursively count the valid subarrays that include m and satisfy the conditions. Add the counts from the left and right subarrays.

But how to compute the count for the current range [l..r] based on the maximum.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of the problem in terms of the maximum.

Suppose the current maximum is at position m. Any subarray that includes m must have m as the maximum. For such a subarray to be Decinc, the maximum can be in A or D.

If the maximum is in A:

Then, the elements to the left of m must form a Decinc subarray where the last element in A is less than p[m]. The elements to the right of m must form a Decinc subarray where all elements are part of D and form a decreasing subsequence, all less than p[m].

If the maximum is in D:

Then, the elements to the left of m must form a Decinc subarray where the last element in D is greater than p[m]. The elements to the right of m must form a Decinc subarray where the elements are part of D and form a decreasing subsequence, all less than p[m].

But this seems very abstract and I'm not sure how to translate this into code.

Alternatively, perhaps the Decinc subarrays can be counted by considering that for a subarray to be valid, the maximum element must be part of D, and all elements to the left must be part of D and form a decreasing sequence leading up to the maximum, while the elements to the right form a valid Decinc subarray.

This approach could be manageable.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, perhaps the valid subarrays are exactly those that are either:

1. Increasing.

2. Decreasing.

3. A combination where the maximum element is part of a decreasing subsequence and splits the array into parts.

But this isn't sufficient.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal way is to find for each position the range of valid left indices l such that the subarray [l..r] is valid. Then, summing these ranges gives the answer.

To find this, we can track for each r the valid l's.

For example, a subarray [l..r] is valid if:

- The maximum element in the subarray can be part of D, and the elements to the left and right of it are valid.

But again, not sure.

Another observation: For a subarray to be valid, the elements must form a sequence where any three elements do not form a 3-1-2 pattern. Wait, but this isn't clear.

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following properties:

A subarray is Decinc if and only if there exists no three elements a, b, c in the subarray such that a < b < c and the order of these elements in the subarray is a followed by c followed by b. Such a triplet would require that a is in A (since a < b < c), but c is in D (since after a, we have c which is larger than a, but then b is after c and is larger than a but smaller than c. This could cause issues.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem is similar to the problem of checking if the array can be partitioned into two subsequences, one increasing and the other decreasing. Such arrays are known as "2-подпоследовательные" or "bi-sorted" arrays, but I'm not sure of the exact terminology.

A quick search in my memory: There's a problem where you have to determine whether a permutation can be partitioned into an increasing and a decreasing subsequence. The solution involves the permutation being a "double permuton" or something similar. But I'm not sure.

But in any case, for a permutation to be partitionable into an increasing and a decreasing subsequence, it must satisfy that the permutation does not contain any of the forbidden configurations, such as a 321 pattern. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. For each element, decide whether to include it in A or D based on certain conditions.

For example, when processing elements from left to right:

- If the current element can be added to A (i.e., larger than the last element in A), add it to A.

- Else, if it can be added to D (i.e., smaller than the last element in D), add it to D.

- Else, the subarray is not Decinc.

But this approach may not work for all cases.

For example, consider the subarray [3,2,4,1,5]. The greedy approach would process 3, add to A (since A is empty). Then 2: cannot be added to A (3 > 2), but can be added to D (D is empty). Then 4: can be added to A (2 < 4). Then 1: can't be added to A (4 > 1), can be added to D (2 > 1). Then 5: can be added to A (4 < 5). This gives a valid split. But this is exactly the example from the problem statement.

But what about a case where the greedy approach fails? For example, suppose we have [2,3,1]. The greedy approach would add 2 to A, 3 to A, and 1 to D. This is valid. So the split is A=[2,3], D=[1], which is correct.

Another example: [5,4,3,2,1]. The greedy approach would add 5 to A, 4 can't be added to A (5>4), so add to D. 3 can be added to D (4>3), etc. The split is A=[5], D=[4,3,2,1]. Which is valid.

Another example: [3,1,2]. The greedy approach adds 3 to A. 1 can't be added to A, added to D. 2 can't be added to A (3>2), and can't be added to D (1 < 2). So the subarray is not valid. But wait, [3,1,2] is a valid subarray: split into A=[3,2] (increasing) and D=[1] (decreasing). No, because A would need to be increasing. [3,2] is not increasing. So the subarray [3,1,2] is not valid. Thus, the greedy approach correctly rejects it.

So this approach seems to work for some cases, but is it general?

If the greedy approach can correctly decide whether a subarray is valid, then for each r, we can find the maximum l such that the subarray [l..r] can be split into A and D using the greedy method. But this may not capture all possible splits, as there might be alternative ways to split the subarray even if the greedy approach fails.

However, if the greedy approach captures all possible splits, then this could be a way forward.

Let's try to model this.

For each r, we can track the current A and D sequences as we process elements from left to right.

But since we need to consider all possible starting points l, this may not be feasible.

Another idea: For each r, the valid l's form a contiguous interval. That is, if [l..r] is valid, then [l+1..r] may or may not be valid. But if for a given r, there's a range of l's that are valid, then the count for r is the number of l's in that range.

But how to compute this range.

Alternatively, perhaps for each r, the valid l's are all l's >= some start value. For example, the earliest l where [l..r] is valid.

If this is the case, then for each r, the number of valid l's is r - earliest_l + 1.

But how to compute earliest_l.

This brings us back to the dynamic programming approach. For each r, earliest_l is the earliest possible l where [l..r] is valid. Then, the count for r is r - earliest_l + 1.

But how to compute earliest_l.

If we can compute for each r the earliest_l, then the total count is the sum of (r - earliest_l + 1) for all r.

Now, the problem reduces to finding earliest_l for each r.

So, the key is to find for each r the smallest l such that the subarray [l..r] is valid. Once we have this, the answer is straightforward.

But how to compute earliest_l.

Let's consider that earliest_l can be computed by maintaining two pointers: one for the current earliest_l when the subarray ends in A, and one for when it ends in D.

Alternatively, for each r, earliest_l is the minimum between the earliest_l when ending in A and ending in D.

But how to track these.

Let's model this with dynamic programming.

We can track two variables for each r:

- a_prev: the earliest l such that the subarray [l..r-1] is valid and ends in A.

- d_prev: the earliest l such that the subarray [l..r-1] is valid and ends in D.

Then, when processing r, we have two possibilities:

1. Add p[r] to A. This is possible if p[r] > a_val, where a_val is the value of A's last element in the subarray ending at r-1. Then, the new earliest_l for ending in A is a_prev, and the new a_val is p[r].

2. Add p[r] to D. This is possible if p[r] < d_val, where d_val is the value of D's last element in the subarray ending at r-1. Then, the new earliest_l for ending in D is d_prev, and the new d_val is p[r].

The earliest_l for r is the minimum of the earliest_l for ending in A and D.

But how to track a_val and d_val.

Alternatively, for each r, we can track the maximum a_val and minimum d_val possible for the subarrays ending at r.

So, let's define for each r:

- a_val: the maximum possible value of A's last element for subarrays ending at r in A.

- a_low: the earliest l for subarrays ending at r in A.

- d_val: the minimum possible value of D's last element for subarrays ending at r in D.

- d_low: the earliest l for subarrays ending at r in D.

Then, for each r, we can compute these values based on the previous r-1.

Let's see:

For r=0 (initial case), we have a_val = -infinity, a_low = 0, d_val = +infinity, d_low = 0.

But since the array is 1-based, perhaps we need to adjust.

For r = 1:

If the subarray is [1..1], then it can be split into A (contains 1) or D (contains 1). So, a_val for r=1 is p[1], a_low=1. d_val for r=1 is p[1], d_low=1.

For r=2:

We can try to extend the subarrays ending at r=1.

Option 1: Add p[2] to A. This is possible if p[2] > a_val of r=1. Then, a_val for r=2 is p[2], and a_low for r=2 is a_low from r=1.

Option 2: Add p[2] to D. This is possible if p[2] < d_val of r=1. Then, d_val for r=2 is p[2], and d_low is d_low from r=1.

Additionally, there's the option of starting a new subarray at r=2. So, if the previous options are not possible, we can start a new subarray where [r] is in A or D.

But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, for each r, we can track the best possible a_val and d_val, and their corresponding earliest l.

For example:

When processing r, we can consider two possibilities:

1. The subarray [l..r] ends with r in A. To do this, we can look at the previous subarrays ending in A or D, and see if we can extend them.

   For extending from a previous subarray ending in A (a_prev_val), we must have a_prev_val < p[r]. In this case, the new a_val is p[r], and the new a_low is the same as the previous a_low.

   For extending from a previous subarray ending in D (d_prev_val), we can start a new subarray where the previous elements are from D, but to add p[r] to A, the elements in A must be increasing. So, the new a_val is p[r], and the new a_low is the previous d_low (since the previous subarray ended in D, and we can start the new subarray from d_low to r).

   So, the earliest possible a_low for this case is the minimum between the previous a_low (if extending A) and previous d_low (if extending D).

   But this is only possible if the conditions are met (a_prev_val < p[r] or d_prev_val < p[r]? Not sure).

2. The subarray [l..r] ends with r in D. Similarly, we can extend from previous subarrays ending in D (d_prev_val > p[r]) or from A (a_prev_val > p[r]).

So, for each r, we compute the possible a_val, a_low, d_val, d_low as follows:

a_val_r = max possible a_val.

a_low_r = earliest l where [l..r] ends in A.

d_val_r = min possible d_val.

d_low_r = earliest l where [l..r] ends in D.

Now, to compute these:

a_val_r is p[r] if either:

   a_prev_val < p[r], then a_val_r = p[r], and a_low_r = a_low_prev.

   or d_prev_val < p[r], then a_val_r = p[r], and a_low_r = d_low_prev.

So, a_val_r is p[r] if either of these conditions holds, and the earliest l is the minimum of the previous a_low and d_low.

Similarly, d_val_r is p[r] if either:

   a_prev_val > p[r], then d_val_r = p[r], and d_low_r = a_low_prev.

   or d_prev_val > p[r], then d_val_r = p[r], and d_low_r = d_low_prev.

But if both conditions are possible, we take the minimum possible l.

But how to handle cases where multiple possibilities exist.

This is getting quite complex. Perhaps we can model this with the following rules:

For each r:

- To end in A:

   The previous subarray could end in A or D. We need to choose the possibility that allows the earliest l.

   So, if the previous a_val < p[r], then the earliest possible l is a_low_prev. 

   If the previous d_val < p[r], then the earliest possible l is d_low_prev.

   If both are possible, the earliest l is the minimum of a_low_prev and d_low_prev.

   If neither is possible, then the subarray cannot end in A.

- To end in D:

   Similarly, if the previous a_val > p[r], then earliest possible l is a_low_prev.

   If the previous d_val > p[r], then earliest possible l is d_low_prev.

   If both, take minimum.

   If neither, cannot end in D.

But how to handle the cases where multiple possibilities exist.

So, for each r, we compute:

a_candidate_low = None

if a_prev_val < p[r]:
    a_candidate_low = a_low_prev

if d_prev_val < p[r]:
    if a_candidate_low is None or d_low_prev < a_candidate_low:
        a_candidate_low = d_low_prev

Similarly for d_candidate_low.

If a_candidate_low is not None, then a_val_r = p[r], a_low_r = a_candidate_low.

Otherwise, ending in A is not possible.

Similarly for D.

Once we have a_val_r, a_low_r, d_val_r, d_low_r for each r, then the earliest possible l for the subarray ending at r is the minimum between a_low_r and d_low_r (or whichever is possible).

Then, the number of valid l's for r is r - earliest_l + 1.

Summing this over all r gives the total count.

This seems like a feasible approach. Let's try to implement this.

For each element in the array, we track the current a_val, a_low, d_val, d_low.

Initialize for the first element (r=0):

a_val = p[0], a_low = 0

d_val = p[0], d_low = 0

earliest_l for r=0 is min(0,0) =0, count is 1.

For r=1:

Check if p[1] can be added to A or D.

For A:

Check previous a_val and d_val.

If previous a_val < p[1], then a_candidate_low is a_low_prev (0).

If previous d_val < p[1], then a_candidate_low is d_low_prev (0).

So, a_candidate_low is 0, so a_val_r = p[1], a_low_r =0.

For D:

Check previous a_val > p[1] or previous d_val > p[1].

For example, if previous a_val is p[0], and p[0] > p[1], then a_candidate_low is a_low_prev (0).

If previous d_val > p[1], then d_candidate_low is d_low_prev (0).

So, d_val_r = p[1], d_low_r =0.

earliest_l is min(0,0) =0. So count is 2.

This seems correct.

Let's test this approach with the first example:

Input: 3 elements [2,3,1]

Processing each element:

r=0 (p=2):

a_val = 2, a_low=0

d_val =2, d_low=0

earliest_l =0, count +=1 → total 1.

r=1 (p=3):

Check ending in A:

previous a_val=2 <3 → a_candidate_low=0.

previous d_val=2 <3 → a_candidate_low= min(0,0) → 0.

So a_val_r=3, a_low_r=0.

Check ending in D:

previous a_val=2 >3? No. previous d_val=2>3? No. So cannot end in D.

So d_val_r is not possible.

Thus, earliest_l is 0. count +=2 → total 3.

r=2 (p=1):

Check ending in A:

previous a_val=3 <1? No.

previous d_val: no previous D, so d_val is not available. So cannot end in A.

Check ending in D:

previous a_val=3 >1 → yes. a_candidate_low=0.

previous d_val: not available. So d_candidate_low=0.

So d_val_r=1, d_low_r=0.

earliest_l=0. count +=3 → total 6.

Which matches the first example's output.

Another test case:

Input: 5 4 3 2 1.

Processing each element:

r=0 (5):

a_val=5, a_low=0.

d_val=5, d_low=0.

count +=1.

r=1 (4):

End in A: 5 <4? No. So a_val_r is not possible.

End in D: 5>4 → yes. a_candidate_low=0. So d_val_r=4, d_low_r=0.

earliest_l=0. count +=2 → total 3.

r=2 (3):

End in A: not possible.

End in D: previous d_val=4>3 → yes. d_candidate_low=0. So d_val_r=3, d_low_r=0. count +=3 → total 6.

r=3 (2):

End in D: previous d_val=3>2 → yes. d_low_r remains 0. count +=4 → total 10.

r=4 (1):

End in D: previous d_val=2>1 → yes. count +=5 → total 15.

So the output is 15, which is 5*(5+1)/2=15. Which is correct because all subarrays are valid (each subarray is a decreasing sequence, so can be split into D and empty A).

Thus, this approach seems to work for these cases.

Now, let's code this.

The code will process each element from left to right. For each element, we track the current a_val, a_low, d_val, d_low.

We'll need to initialize the variables for the first element, then update them for each subsequent element.

Here's how the variables are updated:

For each r in 0 to n-1:

prev_a_val = a_val from previous step

prev_a_low = a_low from previous step

prev_d_val = d_val from previous step

prev_d_low = d_low from previous step

For current element p[r]:

Compute new_a_val and new_a_low.

new_a_val = None

new_a_low = None

# Check if can end in A
candidates_a = []
if prev_a_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_a_low)
if prev_d_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_d_low)

if candidates_a:
    new_a_low = min(candidates_a)
    new_a_val = p[r]

Similarly for D:

candidates_d = []
if prev_a_val > p[r]:
    candidates_d.append(prev_a_low)
if prev_d_val > p[r]:
    candidates_d.append(prev_d_low)

if candidates_d:
    new_d_low = min(candidates_d)
    new_d_val = p[r]

Then, set a_val = new_a_val, a_low = new_a_low, d_val = new_d_val, d_low = new_d_low.

The earliest_l for this r is the minimum of new_a_low and new_d_low, whichever is available.

If both are available, take the minimum.

If only one is available, take that.

If neither is available, then the subarray [l..r] cannot be valid for any l <=r.

But according to the problem statement, a subarray can be valid by having the entire array be split into either A or D. For example, a single element is always valid. So there must be at least one possibility.

But in code, we need to handle cases where neither is possible. However, according to the problem's examples and the approach we've taken, this should not happen. But to be safe, we need to handle it.

But according to the greedy approach, the earliest_l is computed as the minimum of a_low and d_low. If neither is possible, then the current element can't be part of any subarray, which is impossible since the subarray [r] is valid.

Wait, for each element, the subarray [r] is valid. So, for each r, there must be at least one of a_low or d_low available.

But according to our code, when processing r=0 (the first element), a_low and d_low are both 0. For subsequent elements, if neither a_val nor d_val can be updated, then it would mean that the current element can't be added to either A or D, making the subarray [r] invalid. But this is impossible, since the subarray [r] is always valid.

So, there's a mistake in the logic. For example, when processing the second element in a subarray like [3, 1], the second element (1) can be added to D (since previous a_val is 3, which is greater than 1). So the code should handle it.

But for the first element, we have a_val and d_val set to p[0], which allows both options. For subsequent elements, the code must handle the case where either a_val or d_val is set.

But according to our code, for the current element to be added to A or D, there must be at least one possibility. Otherwise, the code would have new_a_val and new_d_val as None, which would indicate that the subarray [r] is not valid, which is impossible.

This suggests that our code has a flaw.

But in reality, for the current element, the subarray [r] is valid by itself. So, even if the previous a_val and d_val are not compatible, the current element can be added as a new subarray starting at r.

So, we need to account for this possibility.

Thus, in addition to the previous a_val and d_val, for each element, we must also consider the possibility of starting a new subarray at r.

So, for each r, the new_a_val and new_a_low can also be initialized to p[r] and r, if the current element can be added to A as a new subarray.

Similarly for D.

So, modifying the code:

When processing r:

For the current element p[r], we can consider:

- Adding to A by starting a new subarray at r. This is always possible, since the subarray [r] is valid with A being p[r]. So, a_candidate_low can be r.

- Adding to D by starting a new subarray at r. Also valid, so d_candidate_low can be r.

Thus, for the A case:

candidates_a includes r (since we can start a new subarray).

Similarly for D.

So, in the code:

candidates_a = []
if prev_a_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_a_low)
if prev_d_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_d_low)
candidates_a.append(r)  # new subarray starting at r

new_a_low = min(candidates_a)
new_a_val = p[r]

Wait, no. Because the new subarray starting at r is always possible. So, for the A case, even if the previous a_val and d_val are not compatible, we can start a new subarray.

Thus, the candidates for new_a_low include r.

Similarly for the D case.

So, the code should be adjusted to always include r as a candidate for new_a_low and new_d_low.

But then, this would allow the current element to start a new subarray.

So, modifying the code:

For each r:

For ending in A:

candidates_a = []

if prev_a_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_a_low)

if prev_d_val < p[r]:
    candidates_a.append(prev_d_low)

# Also, can start a new subarray with r in A.
candidates_a.append(r)

new_a_low = min(candidates_a)

new_a_val = p[r]

Similarly for D:

candidates_d = []

if prev_a_val > p[r]:
    candidates_d.append(prev_a_low)

if prev_d_val > p[r]:
    candidates_d.append(prev_d_low)

# Also, can start a new subarray with r in D.
candidates_d.append(r)

new_d_low = min(candidates_d)

new_d_val = p[r]

But this approach would allow for starting a new subarray even if the previous elements are not compatible.

But this is correct, because the subarray [r] is valid.

For example, for r=1 in the first example, after processing r=0 (p=2):

prev_a_val =2, prev_d_val=2.

For r=1 (p=3):

Candidates_a for A:

prev_a_val <3 → 2 <3 → add prev_a_low (0).

prev_d_val <3 → 2 <3 → add prev_d_low (0).

Also, add r=1.

So candidates_a = [0,0,1]. new_a_low is 0.

Thus, new_a_val=3, new_a_low=0.

For D:

prev_a_val (2) >3? No. prev_d_val (2) >3? No. So candidates_d = [1]. new_d_val is 3, new_d_low=1.

But wait, this is incorrect. The subarray [1..1] (p=3) can be added to D as a new subarray, but the previous code would set new_d_val=3 and new_d_low=1. But the subarray [1..1] would have D as [3], which is valid. So, the earliest_l for ending in D is 1.

But in reality, for r=1, the earliest_l for ending in A is 0, and for D is 1.

Thus, the earliest_l for r=1 is 0.

This approach is correct.

But this means that for each r, we are considering the possibility of starting a new subarray, which allows for a valid split.

This solves the problem of the previous code not handling cases where the current element can't be added to the previous subarrays but can form a new subarray.

This adjustment ensures that for each r, the earliest_l is correctly computed.

Let's test this with the example where r=1 and p[r] =3:

prev_a_val =2, prev_d_val=2.

For ending in A:

candidates_a = [0 (from a_prev), 0 (from d_prev), 1 (new)].

new_a_low =0, new_a_val=3.

For ending in D:

candidates_d = [1 (new)].

new_d_val=3, new_d_low=1.

earliest_l = min(0,1) → 0.

count += (1 -0 +1) =2.

This is correct.

Another example: r=2 in the first example (p=1).

prev_a_val=3, prev_d_val=3 (from r=1).

For ending in A:

candidates_a = [0 (if a_prev_val <1? 3 <1 → no), 1 (d_prev_val <1 →3 <1 → no), 2 (new)]. So candidates_a = [2].

new_a_val=1, new_a_low=2.

For ending in D:

candidates_d = [0 (a_prev_val>1 →3>1 → yes, add a_prev_low=0), 1 (d_prev_val>1 →3>1 → yes, add d_prev_low=1), 2 (new)].

 candidates_d = [0,1,2]. new_d_low=0.

new_d_val=1.

Thus, earliest_l = min(2,0) →0.

count +=3 →3-0+1=3+3=6.

Which is correct.

So the code needs to include the new subarray option.

Thus, the code will:

Initialize for r=0:

a_val = p[0], a_low = 0.

d_val = p[0], d_low = 0.

earliest_l = 0. count =1.

For each r >=1:

prev_a_val = a_val.

prev_a_low = a_low.

prev_d_val = d_val.

prev_d_low = d_low.

Compute new_a_val and new_a_low:

candidates_a = list of possible lows for A.

If prev_a_val < p[r], add prev_a_low.

If prev_d_val < p[r], add prev_d_low.

Add r (for new subarray).

new_a_low is min of candidates_a.

new_a_val = p[r].

Similarly for D.

candidates_d:

If prev_a_val > p[r], add prev_a_low.

If prev_d_val > p[r], add prev_d_low.

Add r.

new_d_low is min of candidates_d.

new_d_val = p[r].

Then, earliest_l is the minimum of new_a_low and new_d_low.

count += (r - earliest_l +1).

This approach should correctly track all possible valid l's.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

We need to handle the cases where candidates_a or candidates_d are empty. But since we add r, they can't be empty.

The code:

Initialize:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    p = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    if n ==0:

        print(0, file=output_stream)

        return

    count =0

    # Initialize for first element

    a_val = p[0]

    a_low =0

    d_val = p[0]

    d_low =0

    count +=1 # for r=0

    for r in range(1, n):

        current = p[r]

        # Compute new_a_low and new_a_val

        candidates_a = []

        # Check previous a_val

        if a_val < current:

            candidates_a.append(a_low)

        # Check previous d_val

        if d_val < current:

            candidates_a.append(d_low)

        # Add option to start new subarray

        candidates_a.append(r)

        new_a_low = min(candidates_a)

        new_a_val = current

        # Compute new_d_low and new_d_val

        candidates_d = []

        if a_val > current:

            candidates_d.append(a_low)

        if d_val > current:

            candidates_d.append(d_low)

        # Add option to start new subarray

        candidates_d.append(r)

        new_d_low = min(candidates_d)

        new_d_val = current

        # Update a and d

        a_val, a_low = new_a_val, new_a_low

        d_val, d_low = new_d_val, new_d_low

        # Compute earliest_l for this r

        earliest_l = min(new_a_low, new_d_low)

        # Add the number of valid l's

        current_count = r - earliest_l +1

        count += current_count

    print(count, file=output_stream)

Another test case:

Another test case:

5 4 3 2 1

The code should count all 15 subarrays.

For each r:

r=0: count=1.

r=1 (4):

a_val=5<4? No. d_val=5<4? No. candidates_a includes 1. new_a_low=1.

d_val:

a_val=5>4 → add 0. d_val=5>4 → add 0. add 1. candidates_d = [0,0,1]. new_d_low=0. new_d_val=4.

earliest_l=0. current_count=1-0+1=2. count=3.

r=2 (3):

a_val=4<3? No. d_val=4<3? No. candidates_a includes 2. new_a_low=2.

d_val:

a_val=4>3 → add a_low=0. d_val=4>3 → add d_low=0. add 2. candidates_d = [0,0,2]. new_d_low=0. new_d_val=3.

earliest_l=0. current_count=2-0+1=3. count=6.

r=3 (2):

a_val=3<2? No. candidates_a includes 3. new_a_low=3.

d_val:

a_val=3>2 → add a_low=0. d_val=3>2 → add d_low=0. add 3. candidates_d = [0,0,3]. new_d_low=0. new_d_val=2.

earliest_l=0. current_count=3-0+1=4. count=10.

r=4 (1):

a_val=2<1? No. candidates_a includes 4. new_a_low=4.

d_val:

a_val=2>1 → add a_low=0. d_val=2>1 → add d_low=0. add 4. candidates_d = [0,0,4]. new_d_low=0. new_d_val=1.

earliest_l=0. current_count=4-0+1=5. count=15.

Which is correct.

Thus, this code should work.

Now, let's implement this code in Python.
