<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the goal is to find the minimum time Olya needs to get from one cell to another in a grid, moving up to k cells in one direction each second. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics. Each second, she can choose a direction and run 1 to k meters in that direction. But she can't pass through any cells with cans. So, in each step, she can move multiple cells in a straight line, but all those cells must be empty. And each such step takes exactly one second, regardless of how many cells she moves in that direction. So, for example, moving 3 cells to the right takes the same time as moving 1 cell right if that's the maximum possible in that direction.

This sounds like a BFS problem, where each state is a position (x, y), and the edges are the possible moves. But since moving up to k steps in a direction, each possible movement can be considered. However, a naive BFS where each possible step is considered individually (like 1 step, then 2 steps, etc.) would be too slow, especially with k up to 1000. That would lead to O(nmk) time, which for n=m=k=1000 would be 1e9 operations, way too slow.

So I need a way to optimize this. Let's think about BFS optimizations. The standard BFS approach would track the time taken to reach each cell, and once a cell is visited, we don't process it again. But since each move can cover multiple cells in a direction, maybe we can process all possible cells in a direction in a single step. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use BFS with a priority queue, but since all steps take the same time (1 second), BFS can find the shortest path in terms of steps. So the key is to process cells in the order of their distance (number of steps) from the start.

The main issue is handling the movement efficiently. When moving in a direction, after the first step, all cells in that direction up to k steps or a blocked cell can be covered in one step. So, for each direction from the current cell, we can check how far we can go (up to k steps), and add all the reachable cells in that direction to the queue, but mark them as visited. But doing this for each cell in each direction could be O(4k) per cell. However, if k is 1000, and the grid is 1e3x1e3, this would be 4e6 operations per cell, leading to 4e9 operations for the worst case. That's way too slow.

Wait, but maybe we can find the maximum possible distance in each direction from a cell without checking each step. For example, when moving right, we can check the farthest cell we can reach (min(y + k, m) or until a blocked cell is encountered). Then, for all cells in that path, we can mark them as visited and add them to the queue. But how to do this efficiently.

Another idea is that once we process a cell (x, y), in BFS, for each of the four directions, we can jump as far as possible (up to k steps) in that direction, and for each cell in that path, if it's unvisited, set their distance to current distance +1, and add them to the queue. However, processing each cell in the path would again be O(k) per direction, which is not feasible for k=1e3.

Hmm. So we need a way to process all reachable cells in a direction in O(1) per direction, not O(k). How can that be done?

I remember that in some BFS problems where you can move in all directions until you hit a wall (like in a maze with open corridors), a BFS approach that checks in each direction until a wall is hit, and adds the endpoints. Maybe something similar here.

In this case, for each cell (x, y), when we process it, we check each of the four directions. For each direction, we calculate the maximum possible cells we can move (up to k steps) in that direction, without hitting a blocked cell. Then, for each direction, the furthest cell (or until a blocked cell) is found, and all cells along that path are considered. However, adding all those cells to the queue isn't efficient. But perhaps, once we add the farthest cell in a direction, the intermediate cells can be marked as visited, so that they don't need to be processed again. Wait, but that's not correct. Because in BFS, the first time a cell is visited is the shortest path. So if we can reach a cell in a direction by moving 1 step from the current cell (which is at distance d), then the cell's distance is d+1, which is the minimum possible. So any other path to reach that cell would be longer or equal, so once we process it once, we can ignore it.

So the key insight is: when moving in a direction from (x, y), we can check all cells in that direction up to k steps, but for each such cell, if it hasn't been visited yet, we set its distance to the current distance +1, add it to the queue, and mark it as visited. However, checking each cell in the path from (x, y) to the farthest point in that direction, and processing the first time we reach them, but without processing each cell step by step.

Wait, but how do we efficiently find all the cells in a direction that haven't been visited yet, and then mark them as visited? Because in each direction, there are up to k steps. So for example, moving right from (x, y) up to k steps. We can iterate from step 1 to step k (or until a blocked cell is found). For each step i in that direction, we check (x, y + i). If the cell is blocked, we stop. Otherwise, if it's unvisited, we set its distance to current distance +1, add to the queue, and mark as visited. However, this would take O(k) steps per direction, leading to O(4k) per cell. Which, for k=1e3, and 1e6 cells, is 4e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

So that's a problem. We need a way to process these steps more efficiently.

Alternative idea: when moving in a direction, the cells we can reach are the ones up to the first blocked cell in that direction, up to k steps. Then, for each direction, we can find the maximum possible step (say, s) in that direction where all cells from 1 to s steps are empty. Then, for each of those cells, if they haven't been visited yet, we set their distance to current distance +1 and add them to the queue. But again, this would require O(s) steps for each direction.

Hmm. So the problem is that when k is up to 1e3, this approach would be O(k) per direction, which is not feasible.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For example, when moving in a direction, once you process the farthest cell in that direction, you can avoid processing the cells in between. Because, for example, if in direction right, you can move up to 5 cells, then any of those cells (1-5 steps) can be reached in one step from the current cell. But since BFS processes cells in order of their distance, the first time a cell is visited is via the shortest path. So, perhaps, when processing a cell (x, y), for each direction, we can find the maximum possible steps (s) in that direction, and then for all cells from 1 to s steps, if they haven't been visited, we can set their distance and add them to the queue. However, the order in which these cells are added might not matter because they are all one step away from the current cell. But how to do this without iterating through all s cells?

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each cell, the maximum distance in each direction that can be moved without hitting a blocked cell. But even that precomputation would take O(nm) time for each direction. But that's O(nm*4) which is manageable for 1e3 grids.

Wait, but even if we precompute for each cell (x,y) the next blocked cell in each direction, how does that help in the BFS?

Alternatively, think of the BFS in layers. Each layer represents the time (steps) taken. For each cell in the current layer (distance d), we process all possible cells reachable in one step (distance d+1). But to do this efficiently, perhaps for each direction from (x,y), we can jump to the farthest possible cell (up to k steps), and for all cells in between (from 1 to s steps in that direction), if they haven't been visited yet, we set their distance to d+1 and add them to the queue. However, this would require checking each cell in between, but we can optimize by not checking each cell. Because once the farthest cell is processed, perhaps the cells in between can be considered as visited.

Wait, maybe not. For example, if in the direction right, the cell (x, y+3) is the farthest possible. But (x, y+1) might not have been visited before. So when processing (x, y), you have to mark (x, y+1) as visited, and add it to the queue. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps when moving in a direction, you can consider the farthest cell you can reach, and then any cells between (x,y) and that farthest cell can be considered as having the same distance (d+1). But this is only true if all those cells are reachable in one step from (x,y). So for example, if you can move 5 steps to the right, then all those cells can be reached in one step. So when processing (x,y), for each direction, we can generate all the cells up to s steps (s being min(k, available steps until a blocked cell)), and for each of those cells, check if they have been visited. If not, set their distance and add to the queue.

But again, for k=1e3, this is O(4k) per cell. So in the worst case, this approach is O(4k * nm) which is 4e9 operations for n=m=k=1e3. That's way too slow.

So, we need a better approach. Let's think differently. Maybe using BFS with deque and 0-1 BFS. Wait, but each step is exactly 1 second, so BFS layers are correct.

Alternative approach: use BFS and for each direction, when moving from (x,y), find all the cells you can reach in that direction (up to k steps) and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet, but in a way that only processes each cell once. But how?

Another observation: once you move in a direction from (x,y), any cell beyond (x,y+1) in that direction can be reached in one step. So, for example, moving from (x,y) to (x,y+3) would take one step, but (x,y+1) and (x,y+2) would also be reachable in that same step. However, those cells may not have been processed yet. So the problem is that, in the standard BFS approach, processing (x,y) would require adding all those cells to the queue, but each cell in the path needs to be checked.

But perhaps, when processing (x,y), for each direction, we can check how far we can go (up to k steps), and then add the farthest cell in that direction. Then, when we process that farthest cell, we can backtrack towards (x,y) in the same direction. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, when moving in a direction, for each direction, the cells that can be reached from (x,y) are all in a straight line. So, perhaps for each direction, we can check all possible steps (from 1 to s, where s is up to k or blocked), and for each step i, check if (x, y+i) is unvisited. If so, mark it as visited and add to the queue. However, this is O(k) per direction per cell. Which is again not feasible.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to process the cells in each direction in a way that doesn't require checking every step. For example, when moving right from (x,y), the cells (x, y+1), (x, y+2), ..., (x, y+s) can all be covered in one step. But if any of them are blocked, then s is the maximum.

So, the steps would be:

For the current cell (x, y), for each direction:

   move up to k steps in that direction, checking for blocked cells.

   For each step i (1 to s) in that direction:

       if (x_new, y_new) is unvisited:

           set its distance to current distance +1.

           add it to the queue.

           mark as visited.

But again, this is O(k) per direction. So how can we avoid that?

Hmm. Let's consider the movement. For each direction, we can move up to k steps. So, when processing (x, y), for each direction, the cells that can be reached in that direction are all the cells from 1 to s steps, where s is the maximum possible steps in that direction (up to k, and not blocked). So, perhaps for each direction, the maximum s is determined by the first blocked cell in that direction.

Once s is determined, then the cells (x, y+i) (for i=1 to s) are all reachable in one step. So, to process all these cells, we can mark them as visited, but how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, when moving in a direction, once a cell is processed (added to the queue), we can mark all cells in that direction up to that point as visited. But that's not correct, because other cells might have a shorter path to reach those cells via a different path.

Wait, but BFS ensures that the first time a cell is visited is via the shortest path. So once a cell is added to the queue, any other path to it would have a longer or equal distance. So, if a cell is unvisited when processing (x, y), then the path via (x, y) is the shortest possible. So, in this case, when processing (x, y), we can process all cells in a direction up to s steps, and for each of those cells, if they are unvisited, we set their distance and add them to the queue.

But again, this requires checking each cell in the direction.

So, what's the maximum possible time complexity here?

In the worst case, each cell is processed once, and for each cell, 4 directions are checked. For each direction, up to k steps. So for 1e3 * 1e3 cells, each with 4 * 1e3 steps, that's 4e9 operations. Which is way beyond the allowed time (since 1e8 operations take about 1 second in Python).

So, this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Precompute for each cell the maximum steps possible in each direction. Then, during BFS, for each cell, when moving in a direction, we can jump to the farthest possible cell (s steps), and add all the cells along that path to the queue. But again, how to do that efficiently.

Wait, perhaps we can use BFS with a priority queue (but since all steps are the same cost, it's just a normal queue). The key is to avoid processing each individual cell along the path. How?

Another idea: For each cell (x, y), when you process it, you can explore all four directions, and for each direction, find the maximum possible steps (s) that you can move. Then, for each direction, you can check the cells (x, y) + direction * s, and if that cell hasn't been visited, mark it as visited, set its distance, add it to the queue, and also mark all cells along the path as visited. But this is not correct, as there might be cells in between that haven't been visited yet.

Wait, but once the farthest cell is processed, perhaps the cells in between can be considered as visited. For example, if you can move from (x, y) to (x, y+s) in the right direction, then all cells from (x, y+1) to (x, y+s) are reachable in one step. However, when you process (x, y), you can add (x, y+s) to the queue. Then, when processing (x, y+s), you can explore the left direction, which would allow moving back towards (x, y). But in that case, the cells between (x, y) and (x, y+s) might not have been marked as visited, leading to O(k) steps again.

Hmm. So this suggests that the problem is inherently O(nmk) in time, but for 1e3, that's 1e9 operations, which Python can't handle within 2 seconds.

But the problem allows up to 2 seconds. Python can handle around 1e8 operations in that time. So, we need a solution that is O(nm) or O(nm log nm), not O(nmk).

Wait, but how?

Alternative approach: Use BFS, but for each direction, track the next positions in a way that allows processing all cells in a direction in O(1) per direction. For example, using a deque and processing the cells in layers.

Another idea is to use BFS and for each cell, when moving in a direction, you can mark all cells in that direction up to k steps as visited. But how to do that efficiently.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the problem of moving through corridors (like in some maze problems where you can slide in a direction until you hit a wall). In such problems, the BFS approach is to, for each cell, when you process it, check all four directions, and for each direction, find the farthest cell you can reach (the end of the corridor), then add that cell to the queue. This reduces the number of nodes processed because you only process the endpoints.

But in our problem, the movement isn't limited to corridors; you can move up to k steps. So perhaps a similar approach can be used here. For each cell (x, y), when processing it, check all four directions. For each direction, find the maximum possible steps (s) up to k, and then add the farthest cell (x', y') to the queue. But also, for all cells between (x, y) and (x', y'), if they haven't been visited, set their distance and mark them as visited.

But how to handle the cells between (x, y) and (x', y') without checking each one?

Ah! Here's the key insight: if you can move up to s steps in a direction, then all cells in that direction from 1 to s steps are reachable in one step. So, once you process the cell (x, y), all those cells can be reached in d+1 steps, where d is the distance to (x, y). Therefore, when processing (x, y), for each direction, we can find the maximum s steps, and then for each cell in that direction (from 1 to s steps), we can check if they are unvisited. If they are, we set their distance and add them to the queue. However, even this approach would require O(k) steps per direction, which is not feasible.

But wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think: when moving in a direction, the first cell (1 step) is the closest, and the farthest is s steps. So, perhaps once you process the farthest cell, you can backtrack towards the original cell and mark all the cells in between as visited. But that's not possible with BFS, as the order is determined by the queue.

Alternatively, when processing a cell (x, y), for each direction, we can compute the range of cells that can be reached (from 1 to s steps), and for each cell in that range, if it hasn't been visited, set its distance and mark as visited. But again, this requires iterating through each cell in the range, which is O(k) per direction.

So, for this problem, perhaps the only way is to find an optimized BFS approach that can handle the k steps efficiently. Let's think of possible optimizations.

Another idea: precompute for each cell (x, y) and direction, the maximum possible steps s that can be taken. Then, during BFS, for each direction, the maximum steps s is known. Then, for that direction, we can check all possible steps from 1 to s. But again, that's O(k) per direction.

Alternatively, for each cell (x, y), during BFS, for each direction, we can jump to s steps (the maximum possible), and then check if that cell is unvisited. If it is, we add it to the queue and mark it. Then, for the same direction, we can also check the s-1 steps, s-2, etc., but that would again be O(k) steps.

Wait, but maybe in practice, the BFS can be optimized by checking the cells in the direction in reverse order. For example, moving from (x, y) to (x, y+s), and then moving backward towards (x, y+1). But this would require O(s) steps.

So, perhaps there's no way around this, and the problem is intended to be solved with an O(nmk) solution, but with some optimizations that make it feasible in Python.

But given that n, m, k can be up to 1e3 each, O(nmk) would be 1e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python. So there must be a better approach.

Alternative approach: Use BFS, but for each cell (x, y), precompute the four possible directions and for each direction, precompute the maximum steps possible (s). Then, when processing (x, y), for each direction, we can generate all cells in that direction up to s steps, but instead of checking each cell, we can use the fact that once a cell is visited, its distance is the minimal possible. Therefore, for each direction, after (x, y) is processed, any cells in that direction can be reached via other paths. So, perhaps, for the same direction, we can process the cells in batches.

Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of layers. Each layer is a set of cells that can be reached in t steps. For each cell in the current layer, we can generate all possible cells in the four directions up to k steps. Then, all these cells form the next layer. However, this approach is O(nm) per layer. The maximum possible layers is O(nm) in the worst case, leading to O(nm^2) time, which is also not feasible.

Wait, but for each cell, once it's added to the queue, it's processed exactly once. So the total number of operations would be O(nm) cells, each with four directions, each requiring O(s) steps where s is the maximum steps possible in that direction. So the total operations would be O(4 * sum(s)), where sum(s) for all cells and directions is O(nm * k). Which is again O(nmk) operations.

But for 1e3 * 1e3 * 1e3 = 1e9 operations, Python can't handle that in time.

So there's a contradiction here. What's the correct approach?

Wait, let's think again. The problem is similar to the standard BFS but with a twist: each move can cover multiple cells. So, perhaps the standard BFS can be modified to handle this.

Another idea: For each cell (x, y), when we process it, for each direction, we can explore all possible steps (1 to s), but only add the cells that haven't been visited. However, once we add a cell (x', y') to the queue, we can mark all cells in the same direction beyond (x', y') as already handled. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, precompute for each cell (x, y) and each direction the next cell that is a blocked cell or beyond k steps. For example, for right direction, precompute the maximum steps s that can be taken. Then, when processing (x, y), in the right direction, all cells (x, y+1) to (x, y+s) can be added to the queue if they are unvisited. But again, this requires checking each cell in the path.

Wait, but perhaps we can use BFS with a visited array and for each cell, once it's visited, we can mark all cells in all four directions up to k steps as visited. But that's not possible because other paths might reach them with a shorter distance.

So, this brings us back to the problem of needing to check each cell in the direction.

So, perhaps the solution is to implement BFS with the O(nmk) approach, but optimize it by breaking early in each direction when a visited cell is encountered.

For example, when moving in a direction, we iterate from 1 to s steps (s is the maximum steps allowed in that direction), and for each step i, check if (x + dx * i, y + dy * i) is unvisited. If yes, mark it as visited and add to the queue. However, if during the iteration, we encounter a cell that has already been visited, we can break out of the loop because the cells further in that direction would have already been processed in a previous step. Because once a cell is visited, all cells beyond it in that direction would have been processed when that cell was processed.

Wait, that's an important point. Suppose in the direction right, we are processing cell (x, y). We start moving right 1 step: (x, y+1). If it's unvisited, we mark it as visited. Then, step 2: (x, y+2). If it's unvisited, we mark it. But once we find a cell that's already visited, we can stop processing further steps in that direction, since any further cells in that direction would have been processed via another path.

For example, if (x, y+3) is already visited, then processing steps beyond 3 would be redundant, because (x, y+3) would have already processed those steps when it was added to the queue. So, when moving right from (x, y), once we hit a cell that's already visited, we can break the loop.

This optimization can reduce the number of steps processed per direction. For example, in some cases, after the first few steps, we hit a visited cell and can stop processing further steps. But in the worst case, we still have to process all k steps.

But how does this affect the time complexity? It's hard to tell, but in practice, this optimization can reduce the number of steps processed. However, for the worst case where the entire grid is empty and k is 1000, this approach would still process O(k) steps per direction per cell, leading to O(4e9) steps.

So, this is not feasible.

Alternative idea: use BFS but for each cell (x, y), when moving in a direction, process the maximum possible steps and add all the unvisited cells in that direction to the queue. But how to do this without checking each cell.

Wait, here's a different approach inspired by BFS and the way you handle layers. For each cell (x, y), when processing it, for each direction, we can determine the farthest cell (x', y') we can reach. Then, for all cells along the path from (x, y) to (x', y'), if they are unvisited, we can add them to the queue. But how to determine which cells are unvisited.

But again, this requires checking each cell along the path.

Another observation: the minimal time to reach a cell is the same regardless of the path taken. So, once a cell is added to the BFS queue with a certain distance, we can ignore any future entries for that cell. So, during the BFS processing, when we process a cell (x, y), we can check all four directions. For each direction, we can find the maximum steps s (up to k) possible. Then, for each step i in 1..s in that direction, we check if (x + dx*i, y + dy*i) is unvisited. If yes, we set its distance and add to the queue. But if any step i is already visited, we can break the loop for that direction. Because once we hit a visited cell, all cells beyond it in that direction must have been processed via a shorter or equal path.

Wait, that's possible. For example, if in the right direction, (x, y+3) is already visited. Then, (x, y+4) would have been processed when (x, y+3) was processed, unless (x, y+3) was blocked. So, if (x, y+3) is unblocked and visited, then moving from (x, y) to (x, y+3) is possible, but since (x, y+3) is already visited, adding (x, y+3) again is redundant. Also, any cells beyond (x, y+3) would have been processed when (x, y+3) was added to the queue.

So, the idea is that for each direction, during the iteration from 1 to s steps, once we encounter a visited cell, we can break the loop. Because cells beyond that have already been processed via another path.

This way, for each direction, the number of steps processed would be the number of unvisited cells up to the first visited cell or the first blocked cell, whichever comes first.

In the worst case, this is still O(k), but in practice, for grids that have a lot of visited cells early in the direction, this can save time.

For example, in a grid where all cells are reachable, and each cell is processed once, then for each cell, in each direction, the steps processed would be 1 (since the next cell is already visited). But this isn't true. Let's think: when you process (x, y), you move right 1 step to (x, y+1), which is unvisited and added. Then, when processing (x, y+1), you move right again. But the step from (x, y) to (x, y+2) would have (x, y+1) as the first step, which is now visited, so processing (x, y) would have added (x, y+1), but (x, y+2) would be processed when (x, y+1) is processed.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Processing (x, y):

   in the right direction, steps 1 to s (s= k or until blocked).

   For i from 1 to s:

       check if (x, y+i) is unvisited.

       For i=1: add to queue.

       For i=2: (x, y+2) is unvisited, add.

       For i=3: unvisited, add.

       ...

       For i=k: add.

But after adding all those cells, when they are processed, they will also process their own steps. But this is redundant.

So, in this approach, the first cell in the direction is added, but the next cells are processed when the first cell is processed. But this isn't the case. The first cell (i=1) is added, but the second cell (i=2) is also added during the same processing of (x, y).

Which means that the same cell (i=2) is added to the queue when processing (x, y), even though it could be added when processing (x, y+1). So, this approach leads to processing cells multiple times, which is inefficient.

But if we break the loop once we encounter a visited cell, then when processing (x, y), once we hit a visited cell, we stop processing further steps. So, in the case where (x, y+1) is visited, the loop breaks, and (x, y+2) is not processed here. However, (x, y+1) would have already been processed, and when it was processed, it would have processed (x, y+2).

So, this optimization reduces the number of steps processed per direction.

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize a queue with the start cell (x1, y1), set distance to 0, and mark as visited.

While the queue is not empty:

    Dequeue a cell (x, y) with distance d.

    For each of the four directions (up, down, left, right):

        Determine the maximum steps s in this direction (up to k) where all cells from 1 to s steps are unblocked.

        For i from 1 to s:

            new_x = x + dx * i

            new_y = y + dy * i

            if (new_x, new_y) is visited: break

            if (new_x, new_y) is unvisited:

                set distance to d+1

                mark as visited

                add to queue

            else:

                continue

This way, once a visited cell is encountered in the direction, the loop breaks, avoiding processing further steps.

So, in the worst case where all cells are unvisited and empty, and k=1e3, this approach would process O(k) steps per direction per cell, leading to O(4e9) steps. But in practice, this may not be manageable.

But perhaps in practice, this approach is manageable with some optimizations. Let's look at the sample input.

In the first sample, the path is processed in 3 steps. For each direction, the code would process the maximum steps possible. For example, in the first step, moving 3 steps to the right, adding (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) to the queue. Then, when processing (1,4), etc. But this approach would add all cells up to the maximum steps, leading to processing them once.

But again, in large grids, this would be slow.

But considering that the problem's time limit is 2 seconds, and Python's speed, we need a way to make this O(nm) time.

Hmm.

Wait, another idea: use BFS, but for each direction, track the farthest cell and use a priority queue. But I'm not sure.

Alternative approach: use BFS and represent the grid with a distance matrix. For each cell, when processing it, explore all four directions, and for each direction, compute the maximum steps possible. Then, for each direction, iterate from 1 to s steps, and for each step i, if the cell (x+i*dx, y+i*dy) is unvisited, set its distance and add to the queue. But to optimize, once a visited cell is encountered in the direction, break the loop.

This is the approach I'll try to implement.

Now, let's consider how to read the input and represent the grid.

The input has n rows and m columns. Each cell is '.' or '#'. The coordinates are given as x1, y1, x2, y2. Note that the input uses 1-based indices for the coordinates.

So, to represent the grid, we can use a 2D array (list of lists) where grid[i][j] is True if the cell is blocked. The rows are 0-based or 1-based? The problem states that the input uses 1-based indices. So, for example, (x1, y1) is (1,1) for the top-left corner in the first example.

But in code, we'll need to convert them to 0-based indexes. So, subtract 1 from each of x1, y1, x2, y2.

The BFS will start from (x1-1, y1-1), and we need to reach (x2-1, y2-1).

So, the steps:

Read n, m, k.

Read n lines of m characters each. Create a grid where grid[i][j] is True if it's blocked (i.e., if the character is '#').

Read x1, y1, x2, y2. Convert to 0-based by subtracting 1.

If start == end, return 0.

Initialize a 2D array dist with all values as -1. dist[start_x][start_y] = 0.

Initialize a queue with (start_x, start_y).

For BFS, use a deque.

For each cell (x, y) in the queue:

   For each of the four directions (dx, dy) in [ (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1) ]:

       Compute the maximum steps s that can be taken in this direction.

       s starts at 1 and goes up to k steps, but must not go beyond the grid boundaries, and all cells along the path must be unblocked.

       So, for example, moving right (dx=0, dy=1):

           for i in 1 to k:

               new_y = y + i * dy

               check if new_y is within 0 <= new_y < m.

               check if grid[x][new_y] is not blocked.

               Also, check that the cell is within the grid.

               If any of these conditions fail, break and set s = i-1.

               Else, continue.

       Once s is determined, iterate i from 1 to s:

           new_x = x + dx * i

           new_y = y + dy * i

           if dist[new_x][new_y] == -1:

               dist[new_x][new_y] = dist[x][y] + 1

               append to queue.

               if (new_x, new_y) is the end cell, return the distance.

           else:

               break

But this approach is O(nmk) and may not work for large inputs. However, in Python, using deque and breaking early when a visited cell is encountered can help.

But how to compute s efficiently?

Computing s for each direction each time:

For direction (dx, dy):

   s = 0

   for step in 1 to k:

       new_x = x + dx * step

       new_y = y + dy * step

       if new_x is out of bounds or new_y is out of bounds:

           break

       if grid[new_x][new_y] is blocked:

           break

       s += 1

   s is the maximum steps possible in this direction.

But this loop runs up to k steps, which is 1e3 steps per direction. For each of the four directions, that's 4e3 steps per cell, leading to 4e6 steps per cell, which for 1e6 cells is 4e9 steps. Which is impossible.

This suggests that this approach is not feasible. So, we need a way to precompute for each cell the maximum possible steps in each direction.

Precompute for each cell (x, y) and each direction, the maximum steps possible. For example, for the right direction, for each cell (x, y), precompute the maximum steps s such that all cells from (x, y+1) to (x, y+s) are unblocked and within the grid.

This precomputation can be done in O(nm) per direction, which is manageable.

For example, for the right direction:

For each row x in 0 to n-1:

   start from the rightmost cell.

   For each cell y in m-1 downto 0:

       if grid[x][y] is blocked:

           current_blocked = y

       else:

           right_max[x][y] = current_blocked - y - 1

But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Alternatively, for each cell (x, y), for the right direction:

   maximum steps s such that y + s <= m-1 and grid[x][y+1], grid[x][y+2], ..., grid[x][y+s] are all '.'.

So, precomputing for each cell (x, y) the maximum possible steps in each direction.

How to compute this?

For each direction, we can process the grid in a way that for each cell, the maximum steps is determined by the next blocked cell in that direction.

For example, for the right direction:

For each row x in 0 to n-1:

   we can compute for each cell y, the maximum steps as the number of consecutive '.' cells starting from y+1, up to k steps, but stopping at the first blocked cell or the grid boundary.

This can be computed using a sliding window approach.

But this is O(nm) per direction, which is acceptable for 1e3x1e3 grids.

Yes. So, precompute four matrices: right, left, up, down. For each cell (x, y), right[x][y] is the maximum steps to the right (up to k) that can be taken. Similarly for the other directions.

Once these matrices are precomputed, during BFS, when processing a cell (x, y), for each direction, we can immediately know the maximum steps s (up to k) possible. Then, for each direction, we can iterate from 1 to min(s, k) steps, and check if the cell (x + dx*i, y + dy*i) is unvisited. If it is, mark as visited and add to the queue. But again, this requires O(k) steps per direction.

Wait, but with the precomputed s, the maximum steps is known. So for example, in the right direction, the maximum steps possible is s = right[x][y]. But s can be up to k, but also possibly less if there's a blocked cell before k steps.

So, for each direction, the maximum steps s is min( precomputed value, k ). Then, during BFS, for each direction, iterate from 1 to s steps. For each step i, check if the cell (x + dx*i, y + dy*i) is unvisited. If yes, mark and add to the queue. Else, break.

But even with this precomputation, the BFS is still O(nmk) steps. However, perhaps the precomputation can help in reducing the time in practice.

Alternatively, the precomputed s can be used to find the farthest cell in that direction, and then, during BFS, process that cell first, and then backtrack towards the current cell, but I'm not sure.

But even with precomputation, the problem remains: O(k) steps per direction per cell.

So, perhaps the only way to pass the time constraints in Python is to use BFS with the precomputed directions and optimized loops, possibly using pypy, but the problem requires Python.

So, perhaps the intended solution is to use BFS with the precomputed directions and break early when a visited cell is encountered.

But how to precompute the directions.

Let me think about the precomputation for the right direction:

For each row x, we can compute the right_max for each column y.

For example, in row x, we can process from right to left.

Initialize a variable that tracks the last blocked cell. For each y in m-1 downto 0:

   if grid[x][y] is blocked:

       last_blocked = y

   else:

       right_max[x][y] = min( (last_blocked - y - 1), k )

But wait, this gives the maximum steps possible to the right. For example, if in row x, cells y+1, y+2, y+3 are unblocked, then right_max[x][y] is 3.

But this approach would give the maximum steps possible to the right, but not exceeding k.

Wait, no. For example, if last_blocked is y + s + 1, then the maximum steps possible is s. So, for each cell (x, y), the right_max is the number of consecutive '.' to the right, up to the first blocked cell, or the end of the grid.

But we also have to cap it at k.

So, the precomputation would be:

right_max[x][y] = min( s, k )

where s is the number of steps possible to the right.

This way, during BFS, for each direction, the maximum steps is the precomputed value, which is the minimum between the actual possible steps and k.

Thus, the precomputation for each direction can be done in O(nm) time.

Once we have the precomputed right_max, left_max, up_max, down_max matrices, during BFS processing, for each cell (x, y), for each direction, the maximum steps s is known.

But how does this help during BFS? Because when processing (x, y), for the right direction, the maximum steps is right_max[x][y]. So, during the BFS, for each direction, we can iterate i from 1 to s steps, and for each i, check if the cell (x, y + i) is unvisited. If yes, add to the queue and mark as visited. Otherwise, break.

But this approach still requires O(k) steps per direction per cell, which is too slow.

So, perhaps the precomputation doesn't help in reducing the time complexity but makes the code a bit faster in practice.

Hmm.

But perhaps there's a way to process all cells in the direction in O(1) per direction.

Another idea inspired by BFS layers: For each cell (x, y), when processing it, for each direction, we can generate all possible cells in that direction up to s steps, but instead of processing each cell, we can add the farthest cell to the queue. Then, when processing that farthest cell, we can backtrack towards the original cell. But this requires handling the direction in both ways.

Alternatively, when processing (x, y), for each direction, we can add the farthest cell (x', y') in that direction. Then, when processing (x', y'), we can add the cells in the opposite direction. But this would allow processing the cells in the path, but in a way that covers all cells in between.

But I'm not sure. Let's see:

Suppose from (x, y), we can move s steps to the right to (x, y+s). We add (x, y+s) to the queue. When processing (x, y+s), we can then move left steps (up to k steps), which would allow covering cells (x, y+s-1), (x, y+s-2), etc.

But if those cells were not processed before, then this approach would miss them. So, this approach would not work.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or see similar problems.

Wait, looking for similar problems: this problem is similar to the ones where you can move in a direction until you hit a wall. The standard approach for those problems is to BFS and for each cell, find the farthest cell in each direction and add them to the queue, then backtrack. But in this problem, the movement is up to k steps, not until a wall is hit.

But perhaps a variation of that approach can be used here.

For example, when processing a cell (x, y), for each direction, jump up to k steps (or until a blocked cell), and for each cell in that path, if unvisited, set their distance and add to the queue. However, to avoid processing each cell, perhaps we can add the farthest cell and all the cells in between are marked as visited. But this isn't correct because the cells in between may not have been processed.

Wait, but in BFS, the first time a cell is visited is the shortest distance. So, if we can reach a cell (x, y+5) from (x, y) in one step, but (x, y+3) is also unvisited, then processing (x, y) would add (x, y+5) to the queue. But (x, y+3) is not added. However, (x, y+3) can be reached in one step from (x, y), but the code would not process it. So this approach would miss cells and give the wrong answer.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

So, the only correct way is to process each cell in the direction up to the maximum steps. But this is O(k) per direction per cell.

Which brings us back to the original problem.

So, in Python, how can we handle this?

The key is to optimize the inner loop. For example, in the BFS processing, for each cell, in each direction, iterate i from 1 to s, and for each i, check if the cell is unvisited. If yes, mark and add to the queue. But in Python, loops are slow, so we need to find a way to vectorize or process this in a way that's efficient.

But in practice, for each direction, after precomputing s, the maximum steps possible, the loop can be optimized as follows:

For direction (dx, dy):

   max_steps = precomputed_max_steps[x][y]

   max_steps = min(max_steps, k)

   for i in range(1, max_steps+1):

       new_x = x + dx * i

       new_y = y + dy * i

       if dist[new_x][new_y] == -1:

           dist[new_x][new_y] = dist[x][y] + 1

           queue.append( (new_x, new_y) )

           if (new_x, new_y) == end:

               return dist[new_x][new_y]

       else:

           break

This code breaks the loop when a visited cell is encountered. This way, if in the direction, some cells have already been visited, the loop stops, avoiding unnecessary processing.

This optimization can save a lot of time. For example, if the first cell in the direction is already visited, the loop breaks after one iteration.

In cases where many cells are visited, this can reduce the number of steps per direction.

But in the worst case, like a grid of all '.' and k=1e3, this approach would process 1e3 steps per direction per cell, leading to 4e3 steps per cell, which for 1e6 cells is 4e9 steps. Python can't handle this.

So, what's the alternative?

Another idea: use BFS with layers and track for each cell the directions already processed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, precompute for each cell the four directions' max steps, and during BFS, for each direction, process the farthest cell first. Then, add that cell to the queue. But then, when processing that cell, we can process the opposite direction. But again, this would miss the intermediate cells.

Hmm.

Alternatively, use BFS but for each cell, when moving in a direction, add all possible cells in that direction to the queue, but use a visited array that marks cells as visited when they are added to the queue. This way, even if a cell is processed multiple times, only the first time it's added to the queue (with the shortest distance) is considered.

But this would require a way to add multiple cells to the queue in O(1) time per cell.

But in Python, this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, use a deque and for each cell, for each direction, append all the unvisited cells in that direction to the queue. But again, this requires O(k) steps per direction.

Another idea inspired by BFS and the use of BFS layers:

The BFS can be implemented using a deque, where each layer is processed level by level. For each cell in the current layer, all possible cells reachable in one step are added to the next layer.

But how to generate the next layer's cells efficiently.

Wait, but the problem is that in each step, a cell can generate up to 4 * k cells. So, the number of cells per layer can be up to 4 * k * cells in the previous layer. This is not manageable for large k.

But the only way to handle this is to find a way to represent the cells in each layer in a way that avoids processing them individually.

Another approach: use BFS with a priority queue (even though all steps are the same cost), but this doesn't help.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a cell, and edges are between cells that can be reached in one step. Then, BFS is the natural solution. The problem is that the number of edges is O(nm * 4k), which is too large.

Thus, this brings us back to the original approach of using BFS and processing each step in each direction, with the optimization of breaking early when a visited cell is encountered.

But to make this work in Python, we need to implement this as efficiently as possible.

So, the plan is:

1. Precompute the four max steps matrices for each cell and direction (right, left, up, down), but capped at k steps.

2. Implement BFS with a deque.

3. For each cell processed, for each direction, compute the maximum steps allowed (s), then iterate from 1 to s, check if the cell is unvisited. If yes, mark and add to the queue. Else, break.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

Precomputing the max steps matrices:

For each direction, we need to compute for each cell (x, y) the maximum steps possible in that direction, up to k steps.

For example, for the right direction:

We can process each row from right to left. For each cell (x, y), the max steps to the right is the minimum between the number of consecutive '.' cells to the right and k.

To compute this, for each row x in 0..n-1:

   current_max = 0

   for y in m-1 downto 0:

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max = 0

       else:

           if y == m-1:

               current_max = 0

           else:

               current_max = right_max[x][y+1] + 1

           current_max = min(current_max, k)

           right_max[x][y] = current_max

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think.

For example, in a row x, starting from y = m-1:

If the cell is '.', then right_max[x][m-1] = 0 (since there's no cell to the right).

For y = m-2:

If grid[x][m-2] is '.', then right_max[x][m-2] is right_max[x][m-1] + 1. But since grid[x][m-1] is '.', right_max[x][m-1] is 0. So right_max[x][m-2] is 1, but min(1, k). So, the maximum steps to the right from (x, m-2) is 1 step (i.e., moving to y = m-1).

But this approach doesn't account for consecutive '.' cells. For example, if there are three '.' cells in a row: y=0, y=1, y=2, and k=5.

For y=0: right_max[x][0] is min(2,5) = 2 steps (y+1 and y+2).

But according to the code above, when processing from right to left:

At y=2 (right-most cell), right_max is 0.

y=1: grid[x][1] is '.', so right_max[x][1] = right_max[x][2] + 1 = 0+1 = 1.

y=0: grid[x][0] is '.', so right_max[x][0] = right_max[x][1] +1= 2.

Which is correct.

But if there's a '#' in y=2, then:

y=2: grid[x][2] is '#', so current_max =0.

y=1: grid[x][1] is '.', current_max =0 (since right_max[x][2] is 0 due to blocked cell). So right_max[x][1] = 0 +1=1. But if y=1 can move to y=2 (which is blocked), that's not possible.

Wait, this approach is incorrect. Because the code above for right_max[x][y] is the number of consecutive '.' cells to the right, including y+1, y+2, etc.

But this approach is not correct. For example, if cell y+1 is blocked, then right_max[x][y] should be 0, because you can't move even one step to the right.

So, the correct way to compute right_max is to find for each cell (x, y) the maximum steps s where cells y+1, y+2, ..., y+s are all '.'.

Thus, the precomputation for right_max can be done as follows:

For each row x:

   current_max = 0

   for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max = 0

       else:

           if y == m-1:

               current_max = 0  # no cells to the right.

           else:

               current_max = current_max + 1 if grid[x][y+1] == '.' else 0

           current_max = min(current_max, k)

           right_max[x][y] = current_max

Wait, no. This code is not correct. Because, for example, cell (x, y) can be '.', but if the next cell to the right is blocked, current_max should be 0.

Alternatively, for each cell (x, y), right_max[x][y] is the maximum number of consecutive '.' cells starting from y+1, up to k.

So, for each row x:

   current_max = 0

   for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max = 0

       else:

           current_max = current_max + 1 if (y+1 < m and grid[x][y+1] == '.') else 0

           current_max = min(current_max, k)

           right_max[x][y] = current_max

But this approach also doesn't work, because it's not considering the entire consecutive '.' cells.

For example, if the row is '....' (all .), then for y=0, right_max should be 3 (steps 1, 2, 3).

But according to this code:

At y=3 (m-1), current_max is 0.

y=2: grid[x][2] is '.', and y+1=3 < m. grid[x][3] is '.', so current_max += 1 → 1. min(1, k). So right_max[x][2] = 1.

y=1: grid[x][1] is '.', y+1=2. grid[x][2] is '.', current_max becomes 2.

y=0: current_max becomes 3.

So yes, right_max[x][0] is 3, which is correct.

But if there is a '#' at y=2:

Row: y=0 . y=1 . y=2 # y=3 .

Then, for y=3: current_max 0.

y=2: grid[x][2] is '#', current_max 0.

y=1: grid[x][1] is '.', y+1=2 is '#', so current_max is 0.

y=0: grid[x][0] is '.', y+1=1 is '.', so current_max is 1.

So right_max[x][0] is 1.

But in this case, from y=0, the steps possible are 1 step to y=1, and then blocked at y=2. So the right_max[x][0] is 1, which is correct.

So this code correctly computes the maximum steps possible to the right.

But how to implement this for all directions.

For each direction:

For right direction:

dx = 0, dy = 1.

For each row x in 0 to n-1:

   current_max = 0

   for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max = 0

       else:

           if y+1 < m and grid[x][y+1] == '.' :

               current_max += 1

               current_max = min(current_max, k)

           else:

               current_max = 0

           right_max[x][y] = current_max

Wait, no. The code above would reset current_max to 0 if the next cell is blocked. But in that case, the current cell can still take 0 steps. But if the current cell is '.', and the next cell is blocked, then the steps possible is 0. So the code is correct.

But this approach is correct for the right direction. For other directions:

For left direction:

dx=0, dy=-1.

For each row x in 0 to n-1:

   current_max = 0

   for y in range(0, m):

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max = 0

       else:

           if y-1 >=0 and grid[x][y-1] == '.' :

               current_max +=1

               current_max = min(current_max, k)

           else:

               current_max =0

           left_max[x][y] = current_max

Wait, no. Because for the left direction, the steps possible are to the left (y decreases).

So, for cell (x, y), the maximum steps to the left is the number of consecutive '.' cells starting from y-1, up to k steps.

So, the code for left_max would process the row from left to right.

For example, for cell (x, y), moving left (dy=-1), the maximum steps is the maximum number of steps possible to the left (y decreases).

So, the code would be:

For left direction:

for each row x in 0..n-1:

   current_max = 0

   for y in 0 to m-1:

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max =0

       else:

           if y-1 >=0 and grid[x][y-1] == '.' :

               current_max +=1

               current_max = min(current_max, k)

           else:

               current_max =0

           left_max[x][y] = current_max

But this is not correct. Let's take an example.

For row x with cells 0: ., 1: ., 2: ., 3: #.

For y=0:

grid[x][0] is '.', y-1 is -1, so current_max is 0.

left_max[x][0] is 0.

y=1:

grid[x][1] is '.', y-1=0 is '.', so current_max +=1 → 1 (assuming k>=1).

left_max[x][1] is 1.

y=2:

grid[x][2] is '.', y-1=1 is '.', current_max becomes 2.

left_max[x][2] is 2.

y=3:

grid[x][3] is '#', current_max is 0.

So, for y=2, left_max is 2, which means moving left from y=2 can take up to 2 steps (to y=0 and y=1). But this is not correct, because moving left from y=2, steps of 1 and 2 would land at y=1 and y=0. So steps possible is 2. So the code is correct.

But this code would not work for cases where there are multiple '.' cells followed by a blocked cell.

For example, row x: . . # . .

Processing left_max:

y=0: can't move left → 0.

y=1: move left to y=0 → 1 step.

y=2: blocked → 0.

y=3: move left to y=2 (blocked) → 0.

y=4: move left to y=3 (.) → current_max is 1 (since y=3 is '.', but y=2 is blocked. So steps possible is 1 (y=3), but next step to y=2 is blocked. So current_max is 1.

But according to the code:

At y=4, grid[x][4] is '.', y-1=3 is '.'.

current_max is previous current_max (from y=3) + 1.

But y=3: grid[x][3] is '.', y-1=2 is blocked. So at y=3, current_max is 0.

So for y=4, current_max +=1 → 1. So left_max[x][4] is 1.

Which is correct: from y=4, can move left 1 step to y=3.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Similarly for up and down directions.

For up direction:

dx = -1, dy=0.

For each column y in 0..m-1:

   current_max =0

   for x in 0..n-1:

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max=0

       else:

           if x-1 >=0 and grid[x-1][y] == '.':

               current_max +=1

               current_max = min(current_max, k)

           else:

               current_max =0

           up_max[x][y] = current_max

But this is not correct. Because for the up direction, the steps are in the negative x direction.

So, for cell (x, y), moving up can take steps up to up_max[x][y].

For example, cell (3, y), up_max[3][y] is 3 if cells 2, 1, 0 are '.'.

But according to the code above, processing x from 0 to n-1:

At x=0: up_max is 0 (can't move up).

x=1: if grid[1][y] is '.', and grid[0][y] is '.', then current_max=1.

x=2: grid[2][y] is '.', grid[1][y] is '.', current_max=2.

x=3: current_max=3.

But this is correct: moving up from x=3, can take 3 steps to x=0.

So the code seems correct.

But for down direction:

dx=1, dy=0.

For each column y in 0..m-1:

   current_max =0

   for x in n-1 downto 0:

       if grid[x][y] == '#':

           current_max=0

       else:

           if x+1 <n and grid[x+1][y] == '.':

               current_max +=1

               current_max = min(current_max, k)

           else:

               current_max =0

           down_max[x][y] = current_max

Thus, this code would correctly compute the maximum steps possible in the down direction.

Once we have the four precomputed matrices, during BFS, for each cell (x, y), for each direction, we can look up the precomputed steps s, and iterate from 1 to s steps.

But even with this precomputation, the BFS may still be too slow for Python.

But perhaps combining the precomputation with the early breaking when a visited cell is encountered can make it feasible.

So, the code steps:

Read n, m, k.

Read the grid, converting to a 2D array of True/False (blocked or not).

Precompute right_max, left_max, up_max, down_max matrices.

Convert the start and end coordinates to 0-based.

If start == end, return 0.

Initialize the distance matrix with -1.

Initialize a deque with the start cell, set distance to 0.

While the deque is not empty:

   x, y = deque.popleft()

   For each direction (dx, dy), and corresponding precomputed steps s:

       s = precomputed_steps for this direction.

       s = min(s, k)

       for i in 1 to s:

           new_x = x + dx * i

           new_y = y + dy * i

           if new_x and new_y are out of bounds:

               break

           if distance[new_x][new_y] != -1:

               break

           distance[new_x][new_y] = distance[x][y] + 1

           if (new_x, new_y) == end:

               print(distance[new_x][new_y] and exit)

           deque.append( (new_x, new_y) )

So, the code will iterate up to s steps for each direction, but break as soon as a visited cell is encountered.

But this approach still has the same time complexity as before. However, the precomputed s can help in reducing the number of steps processed per direction.

In the worst case, this is still O(nmk), but with the precomputation, it may be faster in practice.

Now, let's test this approach against the samples.

Sample 1:

Input:
3 4 4
....
###.
....
1 1 3 1

Converted to 0-based: start is (0,0), end is (2,0).

Precomputed right_max for (0,0):

The row 0 is '....'. right_max[0][0] is 3 (min(3 steps, k=4).

So, during BFS:

Process (0,0) with distance 0.

For right direction (dx=0, dy=1), s=3.

Iterate i=1 to 3:

i=1: new_y=1. unvisited. set distance to 1. add to queue.

i=2: new_y=2. unvisited. set to 1. add to queue.

i=3: new_y=3. unvisited. set to 1. add to queue.

Then, other directions are processed (up, left, down).

For down direction (dx=1, dy=0). For cell (0,0), down_max is 2 (cells 1 and 2 are .).

So s=2. iterate i=1 and 2.

i=1: new_x=1. blocked. So break.

Thus, no steps added for down direction.

For up direction, can't move.

For left direction, can't move.

Thus, the queue now has (0,1), (0,2), (0,3).

Processing (0,1):

Distance is 1.

For right direction, right_max[0][1] is 2 (can move up to 2 steps to y=3). So s=2.

i=1: y=2. unvisited. distance 2.

i=2: y=3. visited. break.

Add (0,2), (0,3) again? No, because they were already added.

But wait, when processing (0,1), the right direction steps would be 2. i=1 (y=2) is unvisited, so added. i=2 (y=3) is visited, so break.

So (0,2) is added again? No, because (0,2) was already added when processing (0,0). So during processing (0,1), when i=1, new_y=2 is (0,2), which is already in the queue with distance 1. So distance is already set to 1, so this code would break.

Thus, the code would not process further steps.

This is correct, as the cells (0,2) and (0,3) were already added when (0,0) was processed.

So, during processing (0,1), the right direction steps would add (0,2) only if it's unvisited, which it's not. So the loop breaks.

The other directions for (0,1) may add other cells.

This approach would correctly find the path.

But perhaps in code, the steps would be:

After processing (0,0), the cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are added with distance 1.

Then, processing (0,1), (0,2), etc.

But the correct path is to move right 3 steps (0,0) → (0,3), then down 2 steps to (2,3), then left 3 steps to (2,0). But according to the sample explanation.

But the code would find this path by processing cells in BFS order.

But I'm not sure how to verify this.

But according to the sample input, the output is 3.

The code should correctly compute this.

But given the time constraints, implementing this approach in Python may pass the test cases.

So, now to code this.

But implementing the precomputation for all four directions.

First, implement the right_max:

for x in range(n):

    current_max = 0

    for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):

        if grid[x][y] == '#':

            current_max = 0

        else:

            if y + 1 < m and grid[x][y+1] == '.':

                current_max += 1

            else:

                current_max = 0

            current_max = min(current_max, k)

            right_max[x][y] = current_max

Similarly for the other directions.

But how to represent the grid. Since the grid is given as a list of strings, each string is a row. So, for grid[x][y], it's grid[x][y] in the code.

Once the precomputation is done, during BFS, for each cell (x, y), iterate in each direction.

But for each direction, we need to get the precomputed steps, then iterate up to that steps.

But how to handle the directions:

For example, for the up direction, steps are in the negative x direction.

Wait, the precomputed up_max[x][y] is the maximum steps possible in the up direction (dx=-1).

So, during BFS, when moving up, the maximum steps is up_max[x][y], which is the number of steps possible. So, for each i in 1 to up_max[x][y]:

new_x = x - i

new_y = y

Check if new_x >=0.

But how to handle this in the code.

So, for each direction:

directions = [ (dx, dy, max_steps) ]

For example:

up: dx=-1, dy=0, steps = up_max[x][y]

down: dx=1, dy=0, steps = down_max[x][y]

left: dx=0, dy=-1, steps = left_max[x][y]

right: dx=0, dy=1, steps = right_max[x][y]

So, during BFS:

for each (dx, dy) in directions:

    s = steps[x][y]

    for i in 1 to s:

        new_x = x + dx * i

        new_y = y + dy * i

        if new_x <0 or new_x >=n or new_y <0 or new_y >=m:

            break

        if dist[new_x][new_y] != -1:

            break

        dist[new_x][new_y] = dist[x][y] + 1

        if (new_x, new_y) == end:

            print(dist[new_x][new_y])

            exit()

        queue.append( (new_x, new_y) )

But the precomputed steps are up_max, down_max, etc.

Thus, the code for the directions would be:

directions = [ (-1, 0, up_max), (1, 0, down_max), (0, -1, left_max), (0, 1, right_max) ]

So, for each direction, the steps are taken from the corresponding matrix.

Thus, during BFS processing:

for dx, dy, matrix in directions:

    s = matrix[x][y]

    s = min(s, k)

    for i in range(1, s+1):

        new_x = x + dx * i

        new_y = y + dy * i

        if not (0 <= new_x < n and 0 <= new_y < m):

            break

        if dist[new_x][new_y] != -1:

            break

        dist[new_x][new_y] = dist[x][y] + 1

        if (new_x, new_y) == end:

            print(dist[new_x][new_y])

            exit()

        queue.append( (new_x, new_y) )

This code should correctly process all steps in all directions.

But the precomputation for the four matrices must be done correctly.

But implementing this in Python is possible.

Now, to write the code:

First, read n, m, k.

Then read the grid as a list of strings.

Then precompute the four matrices.

Then read the start and end positions, convert to 0-based.

If start == end, output 0.

Else, initialize dist as a 2D list of -1.

Initialize a deque.

Process the BFS.

Now, let's code this.

But wait, the precomputation for each matrix.

For right_max:

right_max = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]

for x in range(n):

    current_max = 0

    for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):

        if grid[x][y] == '#':

            current_max = 0

        else:

            if y+1 < m and grid[x][y+1] == '.':

                current_max += 1

            else:

                current_max = 0

            current_max = min(current_max, k)

            right_max[x][y] = current_max

Wait, no. This code would only check the next cell. But in reality, the current_max should track the maximum steps possible.

For example, in a row of 4 '.' cells:

y=3: current_max is 0.

y=2: since y+1=3 is '.', current_max is 1.

y=1: y+1=2 is '.', current_max is 2.

y=0: y+1=1 is '.', current_max is 3.

But current_max is added each time, but for consecutive '.' cells.

But this approach is incorrect. Because if cell y+1 is '.', but the cell after y+1 is blocked, then current_max would be 1, but the code would process it as current_max += 1 each time.

Wait, no. Let's take an example where the row is '. . # .'.

For y=3 (cell is '.'), current_max is 0.

y=2: grid[x][2] is '#', current_max is 0.

y=1: grid[x][1] is '.', y+1=2 is '#', so current_max is 0.

y=0: grid[x][0] is '.', y+1=1 is '.', so current_max is 1.

Thus, right_max[x][0] is 1, which is correct.

But what if the row is '....' and k=2.

Then:

y=3: current_max 0.

y=2: current_max 1.

y=1: current_max 2 (but min(2, k=2) → 2.

y=0: current_max 3 → min(3, 2) → 2.

Thus, right_max[x][0] is 2.

So, the code correctly caps the steps at k.

But the code is not correct because it only considers the next cell. For example, if the next cell is '.', but the cell after that is blocked, the code would increment current_max by 1, but the next cell's current_max is 0. So this approach is not capturing the consecutive '.' cells.

Ah, I see the problem. The code for right_max is not correctly handling the consecutive steps. For example, if the next cell is '.', but the next cell's right_max is 0 (e.g., due to a blocked cell after that), then the current_max would be 1, but the actual steps possible is 1.

But according to the code, current_max is incremented by 1 if the next cell is '.', which is correct.

But in reality, right_max[x][y] should be the number of consecutive '.' cells to the right of y, up to k.

The current code computes right_max[x][y] as the number of consecutive '.' cells starting from y+1, but only for the next cell. So, this approach is incorrect.

For example, suppose the row is '....' (all .) and k=5.

The code would compute right_max[x][0] as 3 (since m=4).

Which is correct, because from y=0, you can move 3 steps to y=1, y=2, y=3.

But according to the code:

current_max is computed as:

y=3: 0.

y=2: y+1=3 is '.', so current_max = 1.

y=1: y+1=2 is '.', current_max = 2.

y=0: y+1=1 is '.', current_max = 3.

Thus, right_max[x][0] = 3.

Which is correct.

But if k=2, then the code would set right_max[x][0] = min(3, 2) = 2.

Which is correct.

But what if there's a blocked cell in y=2?

For example: row is ' . . # . ' (y=0,1,2 are '.', y=3 is '.').

Then:

For y=3: current_max=0.

y=2: grid[x][2] is '#', current_max=0.

y=1: y+1=2 is '#', current_max=0.

y=0: y+1=1 is '.', current_max=1.

Thus, right_max[x][0] = 1.

Which is correct: from y=0, you can move 1 step to y=1.

Thus, the code seems to correctly compute the maximum steps possible in each direction.

Thus, the code for the precomputation is correct.

But in reality, the code is not correct. Because the code's current_max is the previous cell's current_max plus 1, but this only considers the next cell. For example, if the next cell's right_max is 0 (because it's blocked), then the current cell's current_max would be 1, but in reality, the cell after next is blocked, so steps possible is 1.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, the precomputation is correct.

Thus, the code for the four directions can be implemented.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But in Python, for large matrices, creating four matrices of size 1e3x1e3 is manageable.

So, the code would be:

Read n, m, k.

Read the grid as a list of strings.

precompute right_max, left_max, up_max, down_max.

Then, read x1, y1, x2, y2, and convert to 0-based.

Check if start == end.

Initialize the queue and distance matrix.

Process BFS.

Thus, the code:

import sys
from collections import deque

n, m, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
grid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Precompute the four matrices
right_max = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
left_max = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
up_max = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
down_max = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]

# Compute right_max
for x in range(n):
    current_max = 0
    for y in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        if grid[x][y] == '#':
            current_max = 0
        else:
            if y+1 < m and grid[x][y+1] == '.':
                current_max += 1
            else:
                current_max = 0
            current_max = min(current_max, k)
            right_max[x][y] = current_max

# Compute left_max
for x in range(n):
    current_max = 0
    for y in range(m):
        if grid[x][y] == '#':
            current_max = 0
        else:
            if y-1 >= 0 and grid[x][y-1] == '.':
                current_max += 1
            else:
                current_max = 0
            current_max = min(current_max, k)
            left_max[x][y] = current_max

# Compute up_max
for y in range(m):
    current_max = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if grid[x][y] == '#':
            current_max = 0
        else:
            if x-1 >= 0 and grid[x-1][y] == '.':
                current_max += 1
            else:
                current_max = 0
            current_max = min(current_max, k)
            up_max[x][y] = current_max

# Compute down_max
for y in range(m):
    current_max = 0
    for x in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if grid[x][y] == '#':
            current_max = 0
        else:

                current_max += 1
            else:
                current_max = 0
            current_max = min(current_max, k)
            down_max[x][y] = current_max

x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
start = (x1-1, y1-1)
end = (x2-1, y2-1)

if start == end:
    print(0)
    exit()

dist = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for __ in range(n)]
q = deque()

start_x, start_y = start

q.append( (start_x, start_y) )

directions = [

found = False
while q:
    x, y = q.popleft()
    current_dist = dist[x][y]

    for dx, dy, matrix in directions:
        s = matrix[x][y]
        s = min(s, k)
        for i in range(1, s+1):
            new_x = x + dx * i
            new_y = y + dy * i
            if new_x < 0 or new_x >= n or new_y < 0 or new_y >= m:
                break
            if grid[new_x][new_y] == '#':
                break
            if dist[new_x][new_y] != -1:
                break
            dist[new_x][new_y] = current_dist + 1
            if (new_x, new_y) == end:
                print(dist[new_x][new_y])
                exit()
            q.append( (new_x, new_y) )

print(-1)

But wait, the code for the up_max and down_max precomputation may be incorrect.

For up_max:

In the code, for up_max:

for y in range(m):

    current_max = 0

    for x in range(n):

        if grid[x][y] == '#':

            current_max =0

        else:

            if x-1 >=0 and grid[x-1][y] == '.':

                current_max +=1

            else:

                current_max =0

            current_max = min(current_max, k)

            up_max[x][y] = current_max

But this is processing x from 0 to n-1. For cell (x, y), the up_max is the number of steps possible in the up direction (dx=-1).

But for example, if x=0, then up_max[x][y] is 0, since can't move up.

x=1: if grid[1][y] is '.', and grid[0][y] is '.', then current_max is 1.

x=2: if grid[2][y] is '.', and grid[1][y] is '.', then current_max is 2.

So, up_max[x][y] is the number of steps possible upwards.

But if there is a blocked cell in x=1:

grid[0][y] is '.', grid[1][y] is '#', grid[2][y] is '.'.

For x=0:

current_max is 0 (x-1 is invalid).

x=1: grid is '#', current_max 0.

x=2: grid is '.', x-1 is 1 (blocked), current_max is 0.

Thus, up_max[2][y] is 0.

Which is correct.

But for x=3 in a row of all '.' cells, the current_max would be 3 (steps up to x=0), but min(3, k).

Thus, the code is correct.

Similarly for down_max.

Thus, the code is correct.

But let's test the first sample:

Sample 1:

3 4 4

....

###.

....

Start: 0,0. End: 2,0.

precompute right_max for row 0:

cells are '.' '.' '.' '.'.

Processing from y=3 to 0.

y=3: current_max 0.

y=2: current_max 1 (y+1=3 is '.').

y=1: current_max 2.

y=0: current_max 3. min(3,4) → 3.

Thus, right_max[0][0] is 3.

For down_max in column 0:

Processing from x=2 downto 0.

For x=2: grid[x][0] is '.', x+1 is 3 (invalid) → current_max 0.

x=1: grid[x][0] is '#', current_max 0.

x=0: grid[x][0] is '.', x+1=1 is '#', current_max 0.

Thus, down_max[0][0] is 0.

So, when processing (0,0), the down direction has s=0, so no steps.

But in the sample, the correct path is to move right, then down, then left.

But according to the code, during processing (0,0), the right direction allows 3 steps.

Thus, the code will add (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) with distance 1.

Then, processing (0,3), during the down direction:

down_max[0][3] is computed as follows:

column y=3.

Processing x=2 downto 0:

x=2: grid[x][3] is '.', x+1 is 3 (invalid). current_max 0.

x=1: grid[x][3] is '.', x+1=2 is '.', current_max 1.

x=0: grid[x][3] is '.', x+1=1 is '.', current_max 2.

Thus, down_max[0][3] is 2 (min(2,4)).

So, during processing (0,3):

down direction steps is 2.

So, i=1: new_x=1, new_y=3. grid is '.'.

distance is 2.

i=2: new_x=2, new_y=3. grid is '.'.

distance is 2.

Add these to the queue.

Then, processing (2,3):

left_max for (2,3) is 3 (steps left up to k=4).

So, i=1: new_y=2, distance 3.

i=2: new_y=1, distance 3.

i=3: new_y=0, which is end.

Thus, distance is 3, which is correct.

Thus, the code would find the correct answer.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, implement this code.
