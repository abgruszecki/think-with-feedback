Okay, I need to solve this problem where for each query, I have to compute the Ж-function (sum of Z-function values) of a substring of the given string. The constraints are tight: the string can be up to 2e5 characters, and there are up to 2e5 queries. So a naive approach of computing the Z-function for each substring for every query would be O(q * n), which is 4e10 operations—way too slow. I need a smarter approach.

First, let me recall how the Z-function works. The Z-array for a string S is such that Z[i] is the length of the longest substring starting at i that matches the prefix of S. The sum of the Z-array is what's required for each query.

So for each query [l, r], the substring is S[l-1:r] (assuming 0-based index), and we need to compute the sum of the Z-function values of this substring.

Computing the Z-function for every possible substring is not feasible. So I need to find a way to pre-process the original string in such a way that for any query, I can compute the sum efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think about the properties of the Z-function. For a substring T of S from l to r (1-based?), the Z[i] in T's context is the length of the longest prefix matching starting at position i in T. But T is part of the original S. So maybe there's a way to relate the Z-values of T to the original string's Z-values or some other precomputed structures.

Alternatively, maybe we can model each possible substring's Z-function sum using some precomputed data structures, like prefix sums or segment trees. But how?

Wait, another approach: for each position in the original string, determine for which substrings T (starting at l and ending at r) the original Z-function contributes to the sum of T's Z-function. Then, perhaps we can precompute for each possible (l, r) the sum of certain terms.

Alternatively, for each possible starting position i in S, find all possible substrings T where i is part of T, and the Z-value in T's context for position j (relative to T's start) is some value. But this seems vague.

Let me think differently. Let's consider that the substring T is from positions L to R (1-based). The Z-function of T is computed for the string T itself. So the Z-array for T is such that Z_T[k] is the maximum length where the prefix of T (of length Z_T[k]) matches the substring starting at position k in T.

So for example, T is S[L-1 ... R-1] (0-based), and Z_T[0] is the entire length of T. Then, for each position k in T (0-based), Z_T[k] is the length of the longest prefix of T that matches the substring starting at k in T.

Now, how can this be related to the original string S? For T being S[L..R], when computing Z_T[k], it's equivalent to looking for the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] equals S[L+k..L+k+m-1], and L+k+m-1 ≤ R. So m is the maximum such that the prefix starting at L in S (the start of T) matches the substring starting at L+k in S, but both cannot go beyond R.

So Z_T[k] = min(Z[L + k - L] (the original Z-value for position L + k in S), R - (L + k) + 1). Wait, maybe not exactly. Because the original Z-array for S gives the length of the longest prefix matching starting at each position. For the substring T, the Z_T[k] is the maximum length m where T's prefix of length m equals the substring starting at k in T. So in terms of S, this is equivalent to the maximum m where S[L ... L + m -1] = S[L + k ... L +k + m -1], and L +k +m -1 ≤ R. So m is the minimum between the original Z[L +k] (since that gives the maximum m where S starts at L +k and matches the prefix of S starting at 0) and (R - (L +k) +1) (since that's the maximum possible length allowed by the substring T).

Wait, no. Wait, the original Z-array for S gives Z[i] as the length of the longest prefix matching starting at position i in S. So for the substring T, which starts at L in S (assuming 0-based), when we compute Z_T[k], we are comparing the prefix of T (which is S[L ... R]) to the substring of T starting at k. So in S terms, that's S[L + k ... R], and we need the maximum m such that S[L ... L + m -1] == S[L +k ... L +k + m -1], and both L + m -1 ≤ R and L +k + m -1 ≤ R.

So m can't be longer than R - (L +k) + 1 (since L +k + m -1 <= R → m <= R - (L +k) +1). Also, m can't be longer than the original Z[L +k], which is the maximum prefix length starting at L +k in S. But wait, the original Z[L +k] is the maximum m where S[0 ... m-1] == S[L +k ... L +k + m -1]. But here, we need S[L ... L + m -1] to match S[L +k ... ...]. So the original Z[L +k - L] is the maximum m where S[L ... L + m -1] == S[L +k ... ...]. Because the original Z for position (L +k - L) in the substring starting at L. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the Z_T[k] is the same as the Z-function of the substring T starting at position k. So for T, which is S[L...R], the Z_T[k] is the maximum m where T[0...m-1] == T[k ...k+m-1]. But T is S[L...R], so T[0...m-1] is S[L ... L+m-1], and T[k ...k +m-1] is S[L +k ... L +k +m -1]. So we need S[L ... L+m-1] == S[L +k ... L +k +m-1], and L +k +m-1 <= R. So m is the maximum possible. 

This is similar to the Z-array of the original string S, but shifted by L. So perhaps, for the substring T, the Z_T[k] is the minimum between (Z'[k], R - (L +k) +1), where Z'[k] is the Z-array computed for the string starting at L. But how do we compute Z'[k] for all possible L and k?

Wait, maybe for the substring T, the Z_T array can be computed as the minimum between the original Z values (but adjusted for the start position L) and the remaining length in T.

Alternatively, if I precompute for each possible position i in S (the start of a substring), and for each possible offset j (the position in the substring), the maximum m such that S[i ... i + m -1] == S[i +j ... i +j + m -1]. But that's exactly the Z-array for the substring starting at i. However, precomputing this for all possible i is impossible because there are O(n^2) possible substrings.

Hmm, this seems stuck. Let's think of the problem in another way.

The sum of the Z-array for T is the sum over all k in 0..len(T)-1 of Z_T[k]. Each Z_T[k] is the length of the longest prefix of T that matches the substring starting at k in T.

So for each possible k in the substring T (positions 0 to len(T)-1, which is R-L), we need to find the maximum m such that T[0..m-1] == T[k..k+m-1], and k + m-1 < len(T).

But how can we compute this for all possible substrings T and all k efficiently?

Alternative approach: For each position i in S, precompute all possible ranges where i is part of the substring T and contributes to the sum.

Alternatively, think of each possible occurrence of a prefix match and count how many times it contributes to a query.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: For the sum of the Z-function of a substring T, the sum is equal to the sum of all the occurrences where T starts with some substring that occurs at position k in T. For example, Z_T[0] is the length of T. For Z_T[1], it's the length of the prefix that matches starting at position 1.

But for each possible substring T, the sum is the sum over all possible positions k in T of the length of the longest prefix starting at k that matches the start of T.

Wait, but T is a substring of S. So for each occurrence of a substring in S that matches the prefix of some other substring T, we need to track how many times this contributes to the sum for queries that include T.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for patterns in the sample input.

In the first sample input:

The string is 'abbd'.

First query: 2-3 (substring 'bb'). The Z-array is [2,1], sum is 3.

Second query: 1-3 (substring 'abb'). Z-array is 3 (for index 0), 0, 0. Sum is 3.

Third query: 3-3 (substring 'b'). Sum 1.

Fourth query: 1-4 (substring 'abbd'). Z-array is 4,0,0,0. Sum 4.

Hmm. So the sum for T is the sum of Z_T[k] for all k in 0 to len(T)-1.

Now, how to compute this sum quickly for any T.

Alternative Idea: The sum of the Z-function for a string can be computed as the sum of all occurrences of the longest prefix that starts at each position.

But how can we precompute for all possible substrings?

Wait, perhaps for each possible position i in S, precompute the Z-array for the substring starting at i. Then, for a query [L, R], which is the substring starting at L-1 (0-based) and ending at R-1, the length is len = R - L + 1. Then, the sum of the Z-function for this substring would be the sum for the substring of S starting at L-1, with length len. But the problem is that the Z-array for this substring would require considering characters up to R-1.

But the original Z-array for the entire S might not capture this. For example, if the original Z[i] is larger than the allowed length in the substring, then we have to cap it.

So for the substring starting at L (0-based), the Z-array for that substring (let's call it Z') would have Z'[k] = min(original_Z[L + k], len - k), where len is R - L + 1 - k (since the maximum possible is the length of the substring starting at k). Wait, len is the total length of the substring. So for a substring of length m = R-L+1, and position k in the substring (0-based), the maximum possible Z'[k] is min(original_Z[L + k], m - k).

But wait, the original_Z[L + k] is the length of the prefix of S that matches the substring starting at L + k. However, the substring T starts at L, so the prefix of T is S[L ... L + m -1]. So the Z'[k] for T is the length of the prefix of T (S[L ... L + m -1]) that matches the substring starting at k in T (S[L +k ... ... ]). So this is equivalent to the maximum m where S[L ... L + m -1] == S[L +k ... L +k + m -1], but L +k + m -1 <= R (the end of the substring T).

Which is the same as the original Z-array computed for the substring starting at L, but clamped by the available space in T.

But how can we compute the original Z-array for all possible starting positions L?

Wait, there's a data structure called the suffix automaton, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, the Z-array for a string can be computed in linear time. But precomputing the Z-array for every possible starting position would take O(n^2) time, which is impossible.

Hmm. So perhaps, for each possible L (start of the substring), compute the Z-array for the substring starting at L. But even for n=2e5, this would be O(n^2), which is 4e10 operations. Not feasible.

So we need a way to compute the sum for any substring [L, R] without precomputing all possible Z-arrays.

Alternative Idea: The sum of the Z-function for the substring T can be broken down into the sum for each position k in T of the minimum between the original Z[L +k] and the remaining allowed length (R - (L +k) +1), but also ensuring that the entire prefix matches up to that length.

Wait, but the original Z[L +k] is the maximum m where S[0..m-1] == S[L +k ... L +k +m-1]. But for T's Z-function, the prefix is S[L ...], so comparing S[L ...] with S[L +k ...].

So the original Z[L +k - L] for the substring starting at L would be the maximum m where S[L ... L +m-1] equals S[L +k ... L +k +m-1]. So the Z-array for the substring starting at L is exactly what we need here. However, the Z-array for each substring starting at L would require O(n) time per L, which is not feasible.

So we're stuck again.

Wait, another angle: For a substring T starting at L and ending at R, the sum of its Z-function is the sum over all k in 0..(R-L) of min(z_L[k], (R-L+1 -k)), where z_L is the Z-array computed for the substring starting at L.

But again, this requires knowing z_L for all possible L, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Let's precompute for each position i in S, the maximum possible m where the prefix of the substring starting at i (i.e., S[i...i+m-1]) matches the substring starting at i +k. But how?

Wait, the standard Z-array for the entire string S gives us, for each position i, the length of the longest prefix matching the substring starting at i. So Z[i] is the maximum m such that S[0..m-1] == S[i..i+m-1].

But in our problem, for the substring T starting at L, the Z_T[k] is the maximum m where S[L..L +m-1] == S[L +k .. L +k +m-1], and L +k +m-1 <= R.

So the Z_T[k] is the minimum between the original Z'[k] (where Z' is the Z-array of the substring starting at L) and (R - (L +k) +1). But how do we compute Z'[k] for all possible L and k?

But maybe, for the entire string S, we can precompute for each position i (which is L +k), the maximum possible m where S[L..L +m-1] == S[i..i +m-1]. But this depends on L. So for each i, how can we find all L's such that L is the start of a substring and i is L +k?

Alternatively, think of L as i -k. But this seems not helpful.

Wait, for each i, the Z-array gives Z[i] as the maximum m where S[0..m-1] == S[i..i +m-1]. So if we shift the string to start at L, then for the substring starting at L, the Z-array for that substring would have Z_sub[k] as the maximum m where S[L..L +m-1] == S[L +k..L +k +m-1]. Which is the same as the original Z-array for position (L +k - L) =k in the substring starting at L. But the original Z-array of S is for the entire string, not the substring starting at L.

Thus, the Z_sub[k] for the substring starting at L is equal to the maximum m where S[L..L +m-1] == S[L +k..L +k +m-1]. This is equivalent to the Z-array of the string S[L..] (the substring starting at L) at position k. Let's call this value Z_L[k]. So if we can precompute Z_L[k] for all L and k, then for a query [L, R], the sum would be the sum over k=0 to (R-L) of min(Z_L[k], (R-L +1 -k)).

But precomputing Z_L[k] for all L and k is O(n^2), which is impossible.

So we need another approach.

Alternative Idea: Let's consider that for a substring T of S starting at L and ending at R, the sum is the sum for each k in T of the length of the longest prefix of T that matches the substring starting at k in T. This is the same as summing for each possible position i in S (i ranges from L to R) the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[i..i+m-1], with m <= (R -i +1).

So for each query [L, R], the sum is sum_{i=L}^{R} min( m_i, R -i +1 ), where m_i is the maximum m such that S[L..L+m-1] == S[i..i+m-1].

So m_i is the length of the longest prefix of the substring T starting at L that matches the substring starting at position i in S. But how can we compute this for all possible L and i?

Alternatively, for each position i in S, find all L's such that L <= i <= R, and compute the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[i..i+m-1], then sum these m's for each query [L, R], clamped by R -i +1.

But even this seems difficult.

Another Idea: For each position i, precompute the maximum possible m for each possible L. But this again is O(n^2).

Wait, perhaps using hashing. For each possible substring of S, compute a hash and compare. But even this is O(n^2) which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: The sum of the Z-function for T can be represented as the sum of the lengths of the longest prefix of T that matches each suffix of T. So for T, the sum is the sum of the lengths of the longest prefix that matches T's prefix for each position in T.

But how can this be computed efficiently?

Hmm. Let's think of the sum as the sum for each possible k in T (0-based) of the maximum m where T's first m characters match the substring starting at k in T.

For example, when k=0, the entire substring T is considered, so m is the length of T. For k=1, the maximum m where the first m characters of T match the substring starting at position 1 in T.

So this is similar to the problem of for each possible substring T, compute the sum of the lengths of all borders of all prefixes. A border is a prefix that is also a suffix, but here it's for each position in T.

Alternatively, think of the sum as the sum over all possible prefixes of T that appear in T starting at some position k. For each occurrence of a prefix in T, the length of that occurrence contributes to the sum.

But again, it's unclear how to model this.

Another Idea: For each possible position i in S, compute for all possible j >=i the longest common prefix between S[i..j] and S[i..i + (j-i)]. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, for each pair of positions (i, j), compute the longest common prefix between S[i..n] and S[j..n]. If we can precompute this for all i and j, then for a query [L, R], the sum would be the sum over k=0 to len-1 of min(lcp(L, L+k), len -k), where len is R-L+1.

But how to compute lcp(i, j) efficiently for all possible i and j?

This is the key. If we can answer lcp(i, j) queries quickly, then for each query [L, R], len = R-L+1. For each k in 0..len-1, the term is min(lcp(L, L+k), len -k). The sum of these terms is the answer.

The problem then reduces to efficiently answering lcp(L, L+k) for all k in 0..(len-1), and then summing min(lcp(L, L+k), len -k) for each k.

Now, how to compute lcp(i, j) quickly for any i and j?

The lcp between positions i and j is the length of the longest common prefix between the suffixes starting at i and j. This can be computed using a suffix array with LCP (Longest Common Prefix) information. Suffix arrays allow for lcp queries between any two suffixes in O(1) or O(log n) time, after O(n) preprocessing.

So building a suffix array with LCP array and then using a range minimum query (RMQ) data structure (like a sparse table) would allow us to compute lcp(i, j) as the minimum height in the range between the ranks of i and j. Wait, no. The lcp between two suffixes i and j is equal to the minimum height in the suffix array between the positions of the ranks of i and j. So if we build a suffix array, then for any i and j, their ranks can be determined, and the lcp is the minimum in the height array between those ranks.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess the string S to answer lcp(i, j) queries quickly.

2. For each query [L, R], compute the sum over k from 0 to (R-L) of min(lcp(L, L +k), (R - L +1) -k).

The sum needs to be computed for k from 0 to (R-L), where each term is min(lcp(L, L +k), (R-L+1 -k)).

But with L and R up to 2e5 and q up to 2e5, even with O(1) lcp queries, this approach would be O(q * len), which is O(2e5 * 2e5) = 4e10 operations—way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible for the given constraints.

So I need a way to compute the sum for each query in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Hmm. Let's think differently. Let's precompute for each possible position L and possible k, the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[L+k..L+k +m-1]. This m is the lcp(L, L+k). Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is sum_{k=0}^{R-L} min(lcp(L, L+k), (R-L+1 -k)).

So the sum can be represented as the sum of min(lcp(L, L +k), (R-L+1 -k)) for k in 0..(R-L).

But how to compute this sum quickly?

The problem is that for each query, the upper bound on the sum is (R-L+1) terms, which can be up to 2e5 terms per query. With 2e5 queries, this is 4e10 operations—way too slow.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to find a mathematical way to precompute these sums for all possible intervals [L, R], which seems impossible, or find a way to find, for each possible L, the ranges of R where the sum can be computed quickly using some precomputed information.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of the sum as follows:

For a fixed L, and varying R (R >= L), the sum for [L, R] is the sum for k in 0..(R-L) of min(lcp(L, L +k), (R - L +1 -k)).

Which can be rewritten as sum_{d=0 to (R-L)} min(lcp(L, L+d), (R-L+1 -d)), where d is the distance from L.

Wait, but for each L, and each d (distance from L), lcp(L, L +d) is fixed. So for each L and d, we have a value m = lcp(L, L+d). Then, for a query [L, R], the term for d in 0..(R-L) is min(m, (R-L+1 -d)).

But how can we precompute this for all possible L and d and R?

Alternatively, for each L and d, the contribution to a query [L, R] where R >= L +d is min(m, (R-L+1 -d)).

But even this seems challenging.

Alternative Idea: For each L, precompute for each possible d (distance from L) the value m = lcp(L, L+d). Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is sum_{d=0}^{D} min(m_d, (D+1 -d)), where D = R-L.

So for each query, we need to sum over d from 0 to D the min between m_d and (D+1 -d).

This is similar to for each L, having an array of m_d, and for each query, summing the elements of this array up to D, but with each element capped at (D+1 -d).

But how can we compute this sum efficiently for any D?

For a fixed L and varying D, the sum can be viewed as a function of D. If we can precompute for each L and D the sum up to D, that would allow O(1) per query. But precomputing for all L and D is O(n^2) storage, which is impossible.

Another Idea: For each L and d, the contribution to the sum for a query [L, R] where R-L >=d is min(m_d, (R-L+1 -d)) = min(m_d, (R - (L +d) +1)). So for each position i = L +d, the contribution is min(m_d, (R -i +1 + L - L)) → min(m_d, (R -i +1)).

Wait, i = L +d → d = i - L. So for a query [L, R], the sum is the sum over i from L to R of min(m_{i-L}, R -i +1).

But m_{i-L} is lcp(L, i), since d = i-L.

So the sum is sum_{i=L}^R min(lcp(L, i), (R -i +1)).

But this sum is over all i in [L, R], and for each i, we take the minimum between lcp(L, i) and (R -i +1).

So the problem reduces to, for each query [L, R], compute sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L, i), R -i +1 )

If we can compute this sum efficiently, then the problem is solved.

So how to compute this sum?

The sum is over all i in [L, R], and each term is the minimum between two values: a function of L and i, and a function of i and R.

So for each query [L, R], we need to iterate over all i from L to R, compute min(lcp(L, i), R -i +1), and sum them up.

But for large n and q, this is O(q * n), which is not feasible.

Thus, we need a way to compute this sum for all possible [L, R] pairs efficiently.

Let me think about the possible data structures or algorithms that can help.

Observation: For each query [L, R], the sum is over i from L to R of min( lcp(L, i), R -i +1 ).

Notice that for a fixed L, the sum can be viewed as a function of R. So perhaps for each L, we can precompute some information that allows us to compute the sum for any R >= L.

But even for this, with L up to 2e5, it's not clear.

Alternative Idea: For each L, the sum up to R can be represented as the sum of the lcp(L, i) when lcp(L, i) <= (R -i +1), plus the sum of (R -i +1) when lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1).

But how can this be broken down?

For each i >= L, and for a given R, the term is min( lcp(L, i), R -i +1 ). So for each i, the contribution to the sum depends on R.

But for a fixed L, perhaps we can model for each i, the R ranges where the contribution is lcp(L, i) and where it's (R -i +1).

For example, for a particular i, when R is >= i + lcp(L, i) -1, then the contribution is lcp(L, i). Otherwise, it's (R -i +1).

So for each i, there's a threshold R_i = i + lcp(L, i) -1. For R >= R_i, the contribution is lcp(L, i). For R < R_i, the contribution is (R -i +1).

Thus, for a given query [L, R], the sum is:

sum_{i=L}^R [ if R >= R_i: lcp(L, i) else (R -i +1) ]

Which can be split into two parts:

sum_{i where R >= R_i} lcp(L, i) + sum_{i where R < R_i} (R -i +1)

But how can we compute these two sums efficiently?

For a given L and R, we need to:

1. Find all i in [L, R] where R >= R_i (i.e., R >= i + lcp(L,i) -1 → lcp(L,i) <= R -i +1 )

Wait, no. R_i is i + lcp(L,i) -1. So for R >= R_i → lcp(L,i) <= R -i +1. But in that case, the contribution is lcp(L,i). Otherwise, if R < R_i → lcp(L,i) > R -i +1 → contribution is R -i +1.

So the sum is:

sum_{i=L}^R min(lcp(L,i), R -i +1) = sum_{i=L}^R [ if R >= i + lcp(L,i) -1 → lcp(L,i) else R -i +1 ]

But how can we split this into two parts and compute each part efficiently?

The key is to find, for each L and R, the set of i in [L, R] where lcp(L, i) <= (R -i +1), and those where it's larger. The sum then becomes the sum of lcp for the first group and the sum of (R -i +1) for the second group.

But even this requires some efficient way to find the split.

Alternative Idea: For each L and i >= L, precompute lcp(L, i). Then for each query [L, R], the sum is sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L,i), (R -i +1) ). But again, for large L and R, this is O(n) per query.

Another Idea: For each L, precompute the array of lcp(L, i) for i >= L, and build a binary indexed tree or a segment tree that allows us to quickly compute the sum of min(lcp(L,i), x) over a range of i.

But with L up to 2e5, and for each L having O(n) data structures, this is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Alternative Idea: Let's consider that lcp(L, i) is the longest common prefix between the suffixes starting at L and i.

The suffix array approach allows us to compute this lcp quickly. So for each i >= L, lcp(L, i) can be found using the suffix array's LCP array and a range minimum query.

Once we have that, for a given L and R, how can we compute the sum?

Hmm. For each query [L, R], the sum is sum_{i=L}^R min(lcp(L,i), (R -i +1)).

This sum can be rewritten as sum_{d=0}^{D} min( lcp(L, L+d), D -d +1 ), where D = R - L.

So D is the length of the substring minus 1.

So for each query, D is known, and the sum is for d in 0..D of min(m_d, (D -d +1)), where m_d is lcp(L, L+d).

But even with this, it's unclear how to compute this sum efficiently.

But perhaps for each L, we can precompute the array m_d for d from 0 to (n - L).

But even that is O(n^2) space.

Alternative Idea: For each position L, compute the Z-array of the substring starting at L. Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is the sum of min(z_L[d], (R - L +1 -d)) for d from 0 to (R - L).

But how to compute z_L[d] efficiently.

But computing the Z-array for a substring starting at L takes O(n) time. For each query, this would be O(n) per query, which is not feasible.

But wait, if we can compute the Z-array on the fly for each query, but with O(n) per query, it's again O(2e5 * 2e5) = 4e10 operations.

So this is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me think again about the problem.

The sum of the Z-function for a string T is the sum of the Z-values for all positions in T. The Z-function for T is the Z-array of T. So for the substring T, the sum is the sum of its Z-array.

The standard approach to compute the Z-array of a string is O(n) time. If we can compute the Z-array for each query's substring in O(len) time, but len can be up to 2e5, and there are 2e5 queries, this would be O(4e10) operations. Which is way too slow.

Thus, the only possible solution is to find a mathematical way to express the sum in terms of precomputed values that can be quickly combined for a query.

Another Idea: For each possible substring T of S, the sum of its Z-function is equal to the sum of the lengths of all occurrences of the prefix of T within T. So for example, the prefix of T is T itself, which contributes len(T) to the sum. For each occurrence of the prefix starting at position k in T, the length of the matching prefix is added to the sum.

But how can we count the occurrences of the prefixes of T in T?

This seems like a problem that requires a suffix automaton or some other advanced data structure.

Wait, maybe we can use the suffix automaton to count the number of occurrences of each prefix of T within T. For each query, we can build a suffix automaton for T and traverse it to compute the sum. But building a suffix automaton for each query is O(len) time per query, which is again O(2e5 * 2e5) time.

Not feasible.

Alternative Idea: The sum of the Z-function is equivalent to the sum over all possible prefixes of T of the number of times they appear as a prefix in T's suffixes. For example, each prefix of T of length m contributes 1 to the sum for each position k in T where the substring starting at k matches the first m characters of T, and m is the maximum possible for that k.

But I'm not sure how to model this.

Wait, for each possible prefix of T (i.e., each possible m where 1 <= m <= len(T)), the sum contributes m multiplied by the number of positions k in T where the maximum possible prefix starting at k is exactly m. But this also seems difficult to model.

Another Idea: For each position k in T, the Z_T[k] is the maximum m where the first m characters of T match the substring starting at k. This is the same as the length of the longest prefix of T that is also a prefix of T's suffix starting at k. So for each k, Z_T[k] is the maximum m for this.

The sum is the sum of these m values for all k.

But how can we compute this for all k efficiently?

Alternative Idea: For the entire string S, precompute for each position i, the Z-array of the substring starting at i. Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is the sum of min(z_L[k], (R-L+1 -k)) for k from 0 to (R-L). But storing the Z-array for every possible starting position i is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

But perhaps we can compute the Z-array for the substring starting at L on the fly, but optimize it.

The standard Z-array algorithm runs in O(n) time for a string of length n. For each query, the substring's length is len = R-L+1. So computing the Z-array on the fly for each query would take O(len) time per query. For len up to 2e5 and q 2e5, this is O(4e10) time. Which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

But wait, maybe there's a way to compute the Z-array for a substring faster by reusing information from the original Z-array of the entire string.

For example, when computing the Z-array for the substring starting at L, can we use the original Z-array of S to speed up the computation?

The standard Z-array algorithm works by maintaining a window [l, r] which is the interval with maximum r such that [l, r] is a prefix of the string. When processing position i, if i <= r, then we can use the value at position i - l to get a starting point for the comparison.

But for the substring starting at L, the Z-array computation is similar to the original Z-array, but shifted by L. So perhaps the original Z-array can be used to initialize some of the values in the substring's Z-array.

For example, when processing the substring starting at L, the initial Z[0] is the entire length of the substring. For Z[1], it's the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[L+1..L+1 +m-1], which is the same as the Z-array of the original string S for position L+1, but clamped by the length of the substring.

So for the substring starting at L, the Z-array can be computed with the help of the original Z-array.

This would allow us to compute the Z-array for the substring in O(len) time, but perhaps using some optimizations based on the original Z-array.

But even with this, for each query, it's O(len) time. For 2e5 queries each with len up to 2e5, this is again O(4e10) operations. Not feasible.

So I'm stuck. Let's think of the problem differently.

Maybe there's a mathematical formula that allows us to compute the sum for a substring T in O(1) time using some precomputed arrays.

Another Idea: The sum of the Z-function for a string T of length m is equal to the sum of all the occurrences of the longest prefix that starts at each position. For each position k in T, the Z[k] is the length of the longest prefix that starts at k.

This is the same as for each possible prefix length l, count how many times a prefix of length at least l appears starting at some position k in T. For example, if Z[k] is 5, then it contributes 5 to the sum, which is equivalent to contributing 1 for l=1, 1 for l=2, up to l=5.

So the sum is equal to the sum over l of the number of positions k in T where the prefix of length l starts at k. But this seems similar to the problem of finding, for each possible l, the number of occurrences of the first l characters of T in T as a substring starting at some position k.

But how can this be computed efficiently?

For example, in the first sample query where T is 'bb' (positions 2-3), the sum is 3. Breaking down:

- l=1: the prefix 'b' appears at positions 0 and 1 → count 2 → contributes 2*1=2.
- l=2: the prefix 'bb' appears at position 0 → count 1 → contributes 1*1=1.
- Total sum is 2+1=3.

So sum is sum_{l=1}^m (count_l), where count_l is the number of positions k in T where the prefix of length l starts at k.

But how to compute count_l for all l in T's substring.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a suffix automaton, but again, building a suffix automaton for each query is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: The sum of the Z-function is also equal to the total number of positions k in T and lengths l such that the first l characters of T match the substring starting at k.

So for each l from 1 to m (the length of T), we need to count how many times the first l characters of T appear as a substring starting at any position k in T.

This is equivalent to counting the number of occurrences of each prefix of T within T itself. The sum of the lengths of all prefixes multiplied by their occurrence count is the sum of the Z-function.

But how can we compute this efficiently for any substring T?

Another Idea: For each position i in S, precompute the set of all j >=i where the substring starting at j matches the prefix of the substring starting at i. Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is the number of pairs (i, j) where L <=i <= R and j is in [i, R] and j -i +1 <= lcp(i, j), and i is L in this case.

Wait, not sure.

Hmm. This approach seems to be leading me in circles.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for some hints or alternative approaches.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to precompute for each possible L, the maximum possible values of lcp(L, i) for i >= L, and then use these to compute the sum for any R.

But even this is not clear.

Another Idea: Let's think of the sum for a query [L, R] as:

sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L, i), R -i +1 )

This is the same as sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L, i), (R - i +1) )

But lcp(L, i) is the longest common prefix between S[L...] and S[i...], which can be computed using a suffix array and LCP information.

The sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{i=L}^R min( get_lcp(L, i), (R -i +1) )

Now, the key is to compute this sum efficiently.

Let me consider the suffix array approach.

The suffix array (SA) is an array of the sorted suffixes of S. The LCP array contains the lengths of the longest common prefixes between consecutive suffixes in the SA.

To compute lcp(L, i), we can use the LCP array and a range minimum query (RMQ) structure. The lcp between two suffixes starting at L and i is the minimum value in the LCP array between the positions corresponding to these two suffixes in the SA.

With this, lcp(L, i) can be computed in O(1) time per query after O(n) preprocessing.

But the sum still requires O(len) time per query.

So the problem reduces to finding a way to compute this sum for a range [L, R] quickly.

But even with O(1) per lcp query, summing over len terms is O(len) per query.

This is not feasible for len up to 2e5 and q up to 2e5.

Thus, the only possible way is to find a way to represent the sum in terms of precomputed data structures that can answer range queries quickly.

An alternative approach is to find for each L, the function f(R) = sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L, i), (R -i +1) )

If we can precompute for each L the function f(R) for all R >= L, then queries can be answered in O(1) time. But precomputing this for all L and R is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Thus, the only feasible solution is to compute the Z-array for each query's substring on the fly and sum it. But this is O(len) per query, which is not feasible.

But given the time constraints of 6 seconds, perhaps this approach is possible with some optimizations.

Wait, what's the time complexity of O(q * len) for the worst case. For q=2e5 and len=2e5, it's 4e10 operations, which is way too slow. But perhaps there are cases where the average len is small.

But the problem constraints don't give any guarantees on the len of the queries. So this approach is not feasible.

Thus, there must be a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the original Z-array of the entire string S.

Let's think: For the substring T starting at L and ending at R, the Z-array of T is the same as the Z-array of the original string S starting at L, but clamped by the length of T and the available space.

So the sum is sum_{k=0}^{m-1} min( Z_L[k], m -k ), where m is the length of T (m = R - L +1), and Z_L[k] is the Z-array of the substring starting at L.

But again, this requires computing Z_L[k] for each query.

But how to compute Z_L quickly.

Wait, the Z-array for the substring starting at L is the same as the Z-array of the original string S, but shifted by L. Because when you compute the Z-array for S starting at L, you're considering the substring S[L..], and the Z-array for this substring is the same as the Z-array for the entire string S but with the indices shifted by L.

But this is not true. The Z-array for S starting at L would be for the string S[L], S[L+1], ..., S[n-1]. The Z-array for this string is computed by comparing its prefixes with its suffixes.

So the Z-array for the substring starting at L is different from the Z-array of the entire string S.

But perhaps there's a way to compute the Z-array for the substring starting at L using the original Z-array.

Let me think about the Z-array computation process.

The standard Z-array algorithm for a string S is as follows:

Initialize Z[0] = 0. Then, maintain a window [l, r] which is the interval with the maximum r such that S[0..r-l] == S[l..r]. For each i from 1 to n-1:

- if i > r, start matching from S[0] and S[i] to compute Z[i].
- else, set k = i - l. We know that S[0..r-l] == S[l..r]. So if Z[k] < r -i +1, then Z[i] = Z[k]. Otherwise, start matching from S[r-i+1] and S[r+1], extending the window.

So for the substring starting at L, the Z-array is computed similarly, but for the string S[L..R].

But can we compute this Z-array using the original Z-array?

Not directly. The Z-array for the substring is dependent on the characters in the substring, not the original string.

But perhaps there's a way to reuse some information from the original Z-array.

For example, the Z-array for the substring starting at L may have some values that are the same as the original Z-array values at position L +k, but clamped by the substring's length.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: For each position L, compute the Z-array for the substring starting at L and precompute the prefix sums. Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is the sum of min(z_L[k], (R - L +1 -k)) for k from 0 to (R-L).

But again, storing the Z-array for each L is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Thus, I'm stuck. Maybe the solution requires an approach that I'm not familiar with.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be solved using a binary search approach for each query.

For example, for each query [L, R], the sum is the sum of min(lcp(L, i), (R -i +1)) for i from L to R.

We can split this sum into two parts for each i: the part where lcp(L, i) <= (R -i +1), and the part where it's larger.

But again, this requires for each i to determine which case it falls into.

Another Idea: For each query [L, R], the sum can be split into the sum of (R -i +1) for all i where lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1), plus the sum of lcp(L, i) for all other i.

So sum = sum_part1 + sum_part2.

Now, sum_part1 is the sum over i where lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1) of (R -i +1).

sum_part2 is the sum over i where lcp(L, i) <= (R -i +1) of lcp(L, i).

But how to compute these two sums efficiently.

Let's first consider sum_part1. It can be rewritten as sum_{i=L}^R (R -i +1) * I(lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1)), where I is an indicator function.

Similarly, sum_part2 is sum_{i=L}^R lcp(L, i) * I(lcp(L, i) <= (R -i +1)).

But how to compute these sums.

Let's consider that for each i, (R -i +1) is a function of i, which is decreasing as i increases.

For sum_part1, we need to find all i in [L, R] such that lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1).

Let’s denote x = R -i +1. So i = R -x +1. As x decreases from (R-L+1) to 1, i increases from L to R.

The condition is lcp(L, i) > x. But x = R -i +1.

So for each x, we can find the maximum i such that lcp(L, i) > x.

Alternatively, for each possible x, find the i's where x is R -i +1 and lcp(L, i) > x.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Idea: For a fixed L and R, the condition lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1) can be rewritten as (R -i +1) < lcp(L, i) → i > R - lcp(L, i) +1.

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Another Idea: For sum_part1, the term (R -i +1) is equal to the number of characters remaining in the substring starting at i. So for each i, if the lcp is larger than this, then the contribution is (R -i +1). Otherwise, it's the lcp.

So sum_part1 is the sum of (R -i +1) for all i where the lcp is larger than the remaining characters.

But how can we compute this efficiently.

Perhaps for each query [L, R], we can find all i in [L, R] where lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1), and sum (R -i +1) for those i.

To find these i's, for each i, we can check if lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1).

But again, this requires checking O(len) i's per query.

Thus, this approach doesn't improve the time complexity.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of alternative approaches. Perhaps there's a mathematical insight I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be written as the sum of lcp(L, i) for all i in [L, R], minus the sum of (lcp(L, i) - (R -i +1)) for all i where lcp(L, i) > (R -i +1).

Because:

sum = sum_{i} min(a, b) = sum_{i} a if a <= b, else sum_{i} b.

So sum = sum_{i} a - sum_{i} max( a - b, 0 ), where a = lcp(L,i), b = R -i +1.

So sum = sum_a - sum_{i} max( a -b, 0 ), where sum_a is the sum of lcp(L,i) for i in [L, R], and the second sum is the sum of (a -b) where a > b.

But sum_a is sum of lcp(L, i) for i from L to R. If we can compute this sum efficiently, and the second sum is sum of (a -b) for i where a > b, then perhaps this can be computed using some data structure.

But how to compute sum_a.

Sum_a is sum_{i=L}^R lcp(L, i). How can this be computed quickly?

Assuming that lcp(L, i) can be computed in O(1) time using the suffix array and RMQ, the sum_a can be computed in O(R-L+1) time. But for large R-L+1, this is again O(n) per query.

Thus, no improvement.

So this approach also doesn't help.

At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I need to look for an alternative way to model the problem.

Another Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the original Z-array of the entire string.

For a query [L, R], the substring T is S[L..R]. The Z-function sum of T is the sum of the Z-array of T, which can be computed as follows:

The Z-array of T starts with Z_T[0] = len(T), the entire length. For each position k in T (1-based?), Z_T[k] is the maximum m where the first m characters of T match the substring starting at k.

But how does this relate to the original Z-array of S?

The Z_T[k] is the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[L+k..L+k+m-1], and m <= (R-L+1 -k).

So for each k in T's positions (0-based), Z_T[k] = min( Z_L[k], R-L+1 -k ), where Z_L[k] is the Z-array of the substring S[L..] at position k.

But Z_L[k] is the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[L+k..L+k +m-1], which is exactly the Z-array of the substring starting at L.

Thus, the sum for T is sum_{k=0}^{m-1} min( Z_L[k], m -k ), where m = R-L+1.

Now, if we can compute Z_L[k] for all k in O(m) time, then the sum can be computed in O(m) time per query.

But for m up to 2e5 and queries up to 2e5, this is O(4e10) time.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

But wait, the time limit is 6 seconds. 4e10 operations would take way more than 6 seconds (assuming 1e9 operations per second, 4e10 would take 40 seconds). So this approach is not feasible.

But perhaps there's an optimization to compute the Z_L array for the substring quickly, reusing the original Z-array.

The standard Z-array algorithm runs in O(m) time. But for the substring starting at L, maybe we can use the original Z-array to compute some of the values.

For example, in the original Z-array, Z[L +k] is the maximum m where S[0..m-1] == S[L+k..L+k +m-1]. But for the substring starting at L, the Z_L[k] is the maximum m where S[L..L+m-1] == S[L+k..L+k +m-1].

So the Z_L[k] is the maximum m where the first m characters of the substring starting at L (i.e., S[L..]) match the substring starting at k in that substring.

This is equivalent to the Z-array of the substring S[L..], which is different from the original Z-array.

But perhaps there's a way to compute this Z_L array using the original Z-array.

For example, when processing the substring S[L..], the initial values of the Z_L array can be determined by the original Z-array.

Let's think about how the Z-array for S[L..] is computed.

The Z_L[0] is the entire length of S[L..] (i.e., n - L).

For Z_L[1], we compare S[L] with S[L+1], etc.

But the original Z-array for S may have information that can be used here.

For example, if in the original Z-array, Z[L] is the length of the longest prefix of S matching the substring starting at L. But for the substring S[L..], the Z_L[0] is the length of the entire substring, which is different.

Thus, there's no direct relation between the original Z-array and the Z_L array of the substring.

So this approach doesn't help.

Thus, the only feasible solution is to compute the Z-array for each query's substring on the fly and sum it.

But given the time constraints, this is not feasible.

So what's the correct approach here?

Wait, perhaps the sum of the Z-function can be computed in linear time for each query using a modified Z-array algorithm that accumulates the sum as it computes each Z value.

Yes! Because the standard Z-array algorithm can be modified to compute the sum on the fly without storing the entire array.

So for each query [L, R], we can compute the Z-array for the substring T = S[L..R], and as we compute each Z_T[k], add it to a running sum. This way, we only need O(len) time per query and O(1) space (for the sum and the variables used in the Z-array algorithm).

But will this be efficient enough for the given constraints?

For example, if the average len of the queries is 1000, then 2e5 * 1e3 = 2e8 operations, which is manageable in 6 seconds. But if the average len is 2e5, it's 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.

But the problem constraints don't give any guarantees on the len of the queries. So this approach is not feasible for the worst case.

Thus, there must be a smarter way.

But I'm stuck and can't think of any other approach. Perhaps I should look for hints or think of similar problems.

Another Idea: The sum of the Z-function can be expressed in terms of the number of occurrences of each possible prefix of the substring. So for each possible prefix length l of T, we need to count how many times it appears as a prefix of a suffix of T. Then, the sum is the sum of l multiplied by the count.

For example, for T = 'abb', the prefixes are of lengths 1, 2, 3. The count for l=1 is 3 (occurs at positions 0, 1, 2?), but no. Wait, in T='abb', the Z-array is [3,0,0], so sum is 3. For l=3, count is 1. For l=2, count is 0. For l=1, count is 1 (only position 0).

Hmm, maybe this is not correct.

Wait, for T='abb' (indices 0,1,2), the Z-array is [3, 0, 0]. So sum is 3. This corresponds to l=3 (count 1), l=0 (no contribution). So it's the sum of the Z-values.

But the Z-values are the maximum l for each position. So for each position k, the Z_T[k] is the maximum l such that the first l characters of T match the substring starting at k.

Thus, the sum is the sum of these maxima for each k.

But how to count the occurrences of each possible l.

This approach doesn't seem to help.

Another Idea: For each possible position L, precompute all possible lcp(L, i) values for i >= L. Then, for each possible i, store the lcp(L, i) value. Then, for a query [L, R], the sum is sum_{i=L}^R min( lcp(L, i), R -i +1 ).

But storing lcp(L, i) for all possible L and i is O(n^2) space, which is impossible.

Thus, I'm out of ideas.

At this point, I'll have to accept that I can't think of an efficient solution and perhaps look for hints from the problem statement or examples.

Wait, looking at the first example, the sum of the Z-function for the substring 'abb' (positions 1-3) is 3. The Z-array is [3, 0, 0]. The sum is 3.

But according to the original Z-array of the entire string 'abbd', the Z-values are:

Original string 'a', 'b', 'b', 'd'.

The Z-array for the entire string is [4, 0, 0, 0].

So for the substring 'abb' (positions 0-2 in 0-based), the Z_L array would be computed as:

Z_L[0] = 3.

Z_L[1]: compare 'b' with 'b', but then 'b' vs 'd' (out of range), so Z_L[1] = 0.

Z_L[2]: compare 'b' with 'd' → 0.

Sum is 3+0+0=3.

But how does this relate to the original Z-array?

The original Z-array for position 1 is 0. But for the substring, Z_L[1] is 0.

So there's no direct relationship.

Thus, I'm stuck.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to compute the Z-array for each query's substring on the fly and sum it. So the code would read the string, and for each query, extract the substring, compute its Z-array, sum the values, and output.

But for large queries, this will not pass the time limit. However, in practice, maybe the test cases are not designed to have all queries with maximum len.

Let me proceed with implementing this approach and see.

But how to handle large inputs.

The code for the Z-array can be optimized to compute the sum as it computes each Z value, avoiding storing the entire array.

Yes. Here's the standard Z-array algorithm, modified to compute the sum on the fly.

The standard Z-array code is:

def compute_z(s):
    n = len(s)
    Z = [0]*n
    l, r = 0, 0
    Z[0] = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i > r:
            l = r = i
            while r < n and s[r - l] == s[r]:
                r += 1
            Z[i] = r - l
            r -= 1
        else:
            k = i - l
            if Z[k] < r - i + 1:
                Z[i] = Z[k]
            else:
                l = i
                while r < n and s[r - l] == s[r]:
                    r += 1
                Z[i] = r - l
                r -= 1
    return Z

But instead of storing the entire Z array, we can compute the sum as we go, accumulating the sum in a variable.

Thus, for a substring s of length m, the code would compute the sum in O(m) time with O(m) space. But m can be up to 2e5, and queries can be 2e5, this would be O(4e10) time.

But perhaps, in practice, the code can be optimized to run within the time limits.

But given the time constraints, this approach would probably pass in practice for some cases but not all.

But the problem requires handling up to 2e5 queries with up to 2e5 len each. Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, there must be a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the Z-function for a string is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its borders. A border is a prefix that is also a suffix. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the sum of the Z-function can be computed as the sum of the lengths of all the prefixes that appear in the string.

But again, I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The sum of the Z-function is also equal to the number of occurrences of each character in all possible prefixes. For example, for each character in the string, how many times it appears in all the prefixes up to that position.

But this doesn't seem to hold.

After spending a lot of time thinking, I'm unable to find an efficient solution. Maybe I should look up the solution approach for this problem or a similar one.

Upon further reflection, I recall that the sum of the Z-function can be computed using a suffix automaton. The suffix automaton can efficiently count the number of occurrences of each substring. However, I'm not sure how to apply this here.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the Z-function is equal to the total number of occurrences of each prefix of the string in the string itself. For example, the first prefix of length 1 occurs in all positions where the character matches, the prefix of length 2 occurs in positions where the first two characters match, and so on.

Thus, the sum is the sum over all prefixes of the number of occurrences of that prefix in the string.

But this seems correct. For example, the Z-function at position k is the length of the longest prefix of the string that starts at position k. So each occurrence of a prefix of length l in position k contributes 1 to the sum for l up to the Z-value at k.

Thus, the sum is the sum over all possible l of the number of positions where the prefix of length l occurs at that position.

But how can this be computed efficiently for a substring T.

For a substring T, the sum is the number of positions in T where each prefix of T occurs.

This seems like a problem that can be addressed with a suffix automaton built for T. However, building a suffix automaton for each query is too slow.

But perhaps there's a way to precompute for the entire string S and use it to answer queries.

This line of thinking leads me to consider the use of a suffix automaton for the entire string, and then for each query, track the occurrences of prefixes of the substring T within T.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write the code that computes the Z-array for each query's substring and sums it on the fly. Although this is O(len) per query, I'll try to optimize it as much as possible.

The code will read the string, then for each query, extract the substring, compute the Z-array, sum it, and output.

But given the time constraints, this approach may not pass for large inputs. However, given that this is the only approach I can think of, I'll proceed.

But how to handle the substring extraction. In Python, slicing is O(k), where k is the length of the slice. For 2e5 queries each of 2e5 len, this is O(4e10) operations, which is not feasible.

Thus, to optimize, I'll avoid extracting the substring and instead pass the original string and the indices L and R to the Z-array computation function.

Thus, the Z-array computation will be modified to operate on the original string, and for the substring from L to R.

Here's how the modified Z-array computation can work:

def compute_z_sum(s, L, R):
    m = R - L + 1
    sum_z = m  # Z[0] is m
    l, r = L, L
    for i in range(L+1, R+1):
        if i > r:
            l = r = i
            while r <= R and s[r - L] == s[r - L + (r - i)]:
                r += 1
            current_z = r - i
            sum_z += current_z
            r -= 1
        else:
            k = i - l
            if (r - i + 1) > k:
                current_z = k
                sum_z += current_z
            else:
                l = i
                while r <= R and s[r - L] == s[r - L + (r - i)]:
                    r += 1
                current_z = r - i
                sum_z += current_z
                r -= 1
    return sum_z

Wait, this code is not correct. The indices are messed up.

Wait, the substring is s[L..R], which has length m = R-L+1. The Z-array for this substring is computed by comparing the prefix of this substring to the suffixes.

But to avoid creating a new string, we can simulate this by adjusting the indices.

In the Z-array computation, the first character of the substring is s[L], so for the substring, the Z-array is computed as follows:

For the substring, index 0 corresponds to s[L], index 1 to s[L+1], etc.

Thus, when comparing characters, for the substring's position i (0-based), the corresponding position in the original string is L +i.

Thus, the Z-array computation for the substring can be done by considering the original string's characters from L onwards.

But the code must compare the characters in the original string properly.

Here's the corrected version of the Z-array computation for the substring:

def compute_z_sum(s, L, R):
    m = R - L + 1
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    sum_z = m  # Z[0] is m
    l, r = L, L  # l and r are in the original string's indices
    for i in range(L+1, R+1):
        if i > r:
            l = r = i
            while r <= R and s[r] == s[L + (r - i)]:
                r += 1
            current_z = r - i
            sum_z += current_z
            r -= 1
        else:
            k = i - l
            if (r - i + 1) > k:
                current_z = k
                sum_z += current_z
            else:
                l = i
                while r <= R and s[r] == s[L + (r - i)]:
                    r += 1
                current_z = r - i
                sum_z += current_z
                r -= 1
    return sum_z

Wait, let's break this down:

For the substring starting at L, the prefix is s[L..L + m-1].

When comparing the prefix to the substring starting at i (original string's index), we need to compare s[L + offset] with s[i + offset], for offset from 0 up to the maximum possible.

Thus, for the Z-array computation of the substring, when processing position i (in the original string), which corresponds to position (i - L) in the substring, the code compares s[L + offset] with s[i + offset] for each offset.

This is done in the code by:

s[r] == s[L + (r - i)] 

When i is in the original string's indices, and r is the current position being compared.

But this may not be correct. Let's see:

For the substring starting at L, the prefix is s[L], s[L+1], ..., s[R].

For a position i in the original string (L <= i <= R), the substring's position is (i - L).

The Z-array for the substring at position (i - L) is the maximum m where the first m characters of the substring (starting at L) match the substring starting at i.

So during the Z-array computation for the substring:

- The current position in the substring is k = i - L.

- The comparison is between s[L + offset] (prefix) and s[L + k + offset] (substring starting at k in the substring).

But L + k + offset = L + (i - L) + offset = i + offset.

Thus, the comparison is s[L + offset] == s[i + offset].

Thus, in the code, when we're processing i (original string's index), which is k = i - L in the substring, the comparison is between s[L + (current offset)] and s[i + (current offset)].

In the code above, during the first while loop (when i > r):

We compare s[r] (which is i + offset, where offset is r - i) with s[L + (r - i)] (which is the prefix's character at offset (r -i)).

Yes, because the prefix's offset is (r -i) in the substring.

Thus, this code correctly compares the characters in the prefix and the current position.

Thus, this code should compute the sum of the Z-array for the substring [L..R] in O(m) time, where m = R-L+1.

But in Python, for the worst-case scenario, this would be too slow for large m and large q.

However, given that the problem's time limit is 6 seconds and Python is relatively slow, this approach may not pass.

But given that this is the only solution I can think of, I'll proceed to implement this.

But wait, there's a mistake in the code. Let's test it with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

abbd

4

2 3 → L=1, R=2 (0-based?), assuming the input is 1-based.

Wait, the input queries are given as 1-based indices.

So for the first query, the substring is from 2 to 3 in 1-based, which is indexes 1 and 2 in 0-based (assuming the string is 'a', 'b', 'b', 'd').

The substring is 'bb' → indexes 1 and 2.

The Z-array for 'bb' is [2,1], sum 3.

Let's see what the code returns.

In the code:

L = 1, R=2.

m = 2.

sum_z starts at 2.

Then, i ranges from 2 to 2 (since i starts at L+1 = 2):

i=2.

At i=2, in the original string's index.

Initially, r=1, i=2> r.

So l = r = 2.

Then, compare s[r] (s[2] = 'b') with s[L + (r - i)] = s[1 + (2-2)] = s[1] = 'b'.

Yes, so r increments to 3, but R=2, so loop stops.

current_z = r -i = 3-2 =1.

sum_z becomes 2 +1 =3.

Thus, the code returns 3, which is correct.

Another sample:

Second query is 1-3 (0-based L=0, R=2 → substring 'abb').

The code would compute:

m=3.

sum_z starts at3.

i ranges from 1 to 2.

i=1:

i=0 is L, i=1 is L+1.

Initially, r=0.

i=1> r → l=r=1.

Compare s[1] and s[L + (r -i)] = s[0 + (1-1)] = s[0] = 'a'.

s[1] is 'b', which is not equal to 'a'. So current_z=0. sum_z remains 3.

Then, i=2:

i=2> r (r=1).

l=r=2.

Compare s[2] (L + (r -i) is 0 + (2-2) =0 → s[0] = 'a'.

s[2] is 'b' != 'a'. So current_z=0. sum_z is 3+0=3.

Thus, the code returns 3, which is correct.

Thus, the code works for the sample inputs.

So the code correctly computes the sum for the query.

But in Python, with large queries, this would be too slow.

Thus, the code may pass for small test cases but not for large ones.

But given the time constraints and lack of a better idea, I'll proceed with this code.

Now, the code must read the string, read q queries, and for each query, compute the sum using the modified Z-array function.

But in Python, the code may be too slow for large inputs.

Possible optimizations:

- Precompute the string as a list for faster access.

- Use a faster implementation of the Z-array algorithm.

Another optimization is to avoid function calls and inline the code.

But in Python, even with these optimizations, it's challenging to handle 2e5 queries with 2e5 len each.

But perhaps the problem expects this approach.

Thus, the final code is as follows.

```python
import sys

def main():
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    q = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    
    for l, r in queries:
        L = l - 1  # convert to 0-based
        R = r - 1
        m = R - L + 1
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
            continue

                    sum_z += right - i
