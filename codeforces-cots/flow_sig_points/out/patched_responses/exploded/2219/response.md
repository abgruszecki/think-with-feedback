Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to apply k two-step operations on an array a. Each operation consists of first building an array s of partial sums modulo 1e9+7 and then replacing a with s. We need to find the final array after k operations.

Hmm, the constraints are n up to 2000 and k up to 1e9. Oh right, so a naive approach of simulating each step is definitely out of the question. For each operation, simulating O(n) steps would take O(kn) time, which is way too slow when k is 1e9. So we need a smarter approach here.

Let me think about how the operations affect the array. Each operation transforms the array into the partial sums modulo MOD. Let's model this transformation as a matrix or find a pattern that can be exponentiated efficiently.

Wait, each step is applying a transformation. Let's see: after each operation, the new a_i is the sum of the first i elements of the previous a array modulo MOD. So this is similar to a linear transformation. The problem is to find the result after k such transformations.

Let's consider the process as matrix exponentiation. Each operation is a matrix multiplication. Then, applying the operation k times would be equivalent to raising this matrix to the k-th power and multiplying it by the initial vector. But the size of the matrix is n x n, and n is 2000. Raising a 2000x2000 matrix to the k-th power would take O(n^3 log k) time. For n=2000, that's 2000^3 which is 8e10 operations per log k step. That's way too slow. So this approach isn't feasible.

So matrix exponentiation isn't going to work here. Need another idea.

Let's think about how the array evolves after each operation. Let's denote the array after m operations as a^{(m)}. The first operation (m=1) computes the partial sums. The second operation (m=2) computes partial sums of the partial sums, which is equivalent to a kind of combination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after each step, the elements can be expressed as combinations of the original elements. For example, after one operation, a^{(1)}_i is the sum of a_1 to a_i. After the second operation, a^{(2)}_i is the sum of a^{(1)}_1 to a^{(1)}_i. Which is sum_{j=1}^i sum_{k=1}^j a_k} = sum_{k=1}^i a_k * (i - k + 1 + ... ) ? Maybe this can be represented as a combination of coefficients.

Alternatively, let's model the transformations and see if there's a pattern that can be represented using combinatorics. Because each step is a prefix sum, applying k steps might involve coefficients related to combinations with repetition.

Let me consider the coefficients of the original elements in the final array. Suppose after k operations, each element a_j in the original array contributes to a_i in the final array with some coefficient C(i, j, k). Then the final a_i is sum_{j=1}^i C(i, j, k) * a_j^{(0)} mod MOD.

So the key is to find C(i, j, k) for all i and j. Once we have these coefficients, we can compute the final array by multiplying each element with the coefficient and summing.

Now, how do we find C(i, j, k)?

Let's think recursively. For each operation, how do the coefficients change?

After the first operation (k=1), each a_i^{(1)} is the sum of a_1^{(0)} to a_i^{(0)}. So the coefficients for k=1 are C(i, j, 1) = 1 if j <= i, else 0.

After the second operation (k=2), each a_i^{(2)} is the sum of a_1^{(1)} to a_i^{(1)}, which is sum_{m=1}^i sum_{j=1}^m a_j^{(0)} } = sum_{j=1}^i a_j^{(0)} * (i - j + 1). So here, C(i, j, 2) = i - j + 1 for j <= i.

Wait, for k=2, the coefficient is (i - j + 1). For k=3, the coefficients would be the sum of the previous coefficients up to that point. Let's see: a_i^{(3)} is sum_{m=1}^i a_m^{(2)} = sum_{m=1}^i sum_{j=1}^m (m - j + 1) a_j^{(0)} }.

So for each j <= i, the coefficient would be sum_{m=j}^i (m - j + 1) = sum_{t=1}^{i-j+1} t } = ( (i-j+1)(i-j+2) ) / 2. Wait, that's for k=3. So for j <= i, C(i, j, 3) is (i - j + 2 choose 2), which is equal to (i-j+1)*(i-j+2)/2.

Hmm, interesting. Let's see the pattern here. For k=1: C(i,j,1) = 1 if j <=i.

For k=2: C(i,j,2) = (i-j+1) choose 1.

For k=3: C(i,j,3) = (i-j+2) choose 2.

Wait, (i-j+ k-1) choose (k-1). Because for k=1, (i-j + 0) choose 0 is 1. For k=2, (i-j +1) choose 1. For k=3, (i-j+2) choose 2. So the general formula for C(i,j,k) is (i - j + k - 1) choose (k-1). That's the stars and bars theorem.

Yes! Because each step is a prefix sum, which is equivalent to a convolution with a sequence of ones. After k steps, the coefficients become combinations. So the coefficient for the j-th element contributing to the i-th element after k steps is C(k + i - j -1, i-j) = C(k + i-j -1, k-1). This is the standard stars and bars formula.

So the formula for a_i after k operations is the sum from j=1 to i of C(k + i-j -1, k-1) * a_j^{(0)} mod MOD.

Therefore, the problem reduces to computing for each i, the sum over j=1 to i of a_j multiplied by C(k + i - j -1, k-1), all modulo 1e9+7.

Now, the challenge is to compute these combinations efficiently for all i and j, given that k can be up to 1e9 and n up to 2000.

Wait, but when k=0, we just return the original array. So we need to handle that case first.

So for each i, we need to compute the sum for j from 1 to i of a_j * C(k-1 + (i-j), k-1). Because (k-1 + (i-j) choose k-1) is the same as ( (k + (i-j) -1) choose (k-1) ), which matches the earlier formula.

But how to compute these binomial coefficients modulo MOD when k can be up to 1e9?

The binomial coefficient C(n, r) where n can be up to k + n (since i-j can be up to 2000-1=1999 when i=2000 and j=1). So n can be up to 1e9 + 1999, and r is up to 1e9 (if k is 1e9, then r=k-1 is 999,999,999).

But calculating C(n, r) mod MOD for such large n and r is tricky. However, there's a mathematical approach here. The binomial coefficient C(n, r) can be written as C(n, r) = product_{i=1 to r} (n - i + 1)/i. But when r is large and MOD is a prime (1e9+7 is a prime, right?), we can use Lucas theorem or other combinatorial identities.

Wait, 1e9+7 is a prime number. So MOD is prime. Let me check: 10^9+7 is 1000000007, which is a known prime.

But the problem is when r is up to 1e9, and MOD is 1e9+7, which is about the same magnitude. So how can we compute C(n, r) mod MOD for n up to 1e9+1999 and r up to 1e9?

Wait, when r is larger than MOD, then using Lucas's theorem might help, but Lucas is only efficient when the modulus is small. Here, MOD is 1e9+7, which is very large, so that approach isn't feasible.

Wait, but perhaps for our case, the binomial coefficients can be simplified using some properties. Let's think about C(n, r) mod MOD, where n = (k-1) + (i-j) and r = k-1. So n = r + (i-j). So C(n, r) = C(r + (i-j), r) = C(r + (i-j), i-j). So the binomial coefficient is the same as C(r + (i-j), i-j). So when i-j is small (since i and j are up to 2000, i-j can be up to 1999), and r can be up to 1e9, perhaps there's a way to compute this efficiently.

Yes! Because (i-j) is at most 1999. So for each possible d = i-j (which ranges from 0 to 1999), we can precompute C(r + d, d) mod MOD, where r is k-1, for each d.

So for each d in 0..1999, we can compute C(k-1 + d, d) mod MOD.

But how do we compute C(k-1 + d, d) mod MOD when k can be up to 1e9 and d up to 1999?

The formula for C(n, d) where n = k-1 + d is equal to (n) * (n-1) * ... * (n - d + 1) / (d * (d-1) * ... * 1). Since d is up to 2000, this product can be computed in O(d) time per d. But when k is up to 1e9, n can be up to 1e9 + 1999 + ... but the product is manageable.

So for each d (from 0 to 2000), the value of C(k-1 +d, d) can be computed as the product of (k-1 +d) * (k-1 +d -1) * ... * (k) ) divided by d! But wait, modulo a prime MOD, we can compute this as follows:

C(n, d) = product_{i=0 to d-1} (n - i) / (d - i) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a given d, the binomial coefficient C(n, d) can be written as:

C(n, d) = (n * (n-1) * ... * (n-d+1)) / (d! )

But since MOD is a prime, and d! is up to 2000! (which is a very big number, but manageable to compute modulo MOD), we can precompute the inverses of d! modulo MOD, and then for each term, compute the product of (n - i) for i from 0 to d-1, multiply by the inverse of d! modulo MOD.

But n can be as big as 1e9 + 1999, so when d is 2000, we need to compute the product of (n) * (n-1) * ... * (n-d+1) mod MOD.

But how to compute this product efficiently.

Wait, but n = (k-1) + (i-j) = (k-1) + d. So for each d, the product is the product of ( (k-1 + d) - t ) for t in 0..d-1. So that's (k-1 + d) * (k-1 +d -1) * ... * (k). Which is the same as the product from m =k to (k-1 +d) of m. Which is the product of d consecutive terms starting from k.

But how can we compute this product modulo MOD when k can be up to 1e9 and d up to 2000?

Let's think: the product is product_{m=0 to d-1} (k + m) mod MOD.

Wait, because (k-1 +d) = (k-1) +d = k + (d-1). So the terms are k, k+1, ..., k+d-1. So the product is (k) * (k+1) * ... * (k + d-1) mod MOD.

So for each d, compute the product of d consecutive integers starting from k, mod MOD.

But when d is up to 2000, and each multiplication can be done in O(1) time modulo MOD, this is feasible. For each d from 0 to 2000, precompute the product for d terms.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute factorials up to 2000 mod MOD, and their modular inverses.

2. For each d (from 0 to 2000), compute the product P(d) = product_{x=0 to d-1} (k + x) mod MOD. This is the numerator for the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) = C(k +d -1, d).

Wait, wait. Let's correct this. For a given d, the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) is equal to the product from m=1 to d of (k-1 +d - (d -m)) ) / m. Wait, perhaps another way: the product for the numerator is (k-1 +d) * (k-1 +d -1) * ... * (k-1 +d - (d-1)) ). That's (k-1 +d) * (k-1 +d-1) * ... * (k-1 +1). Wait, but that's equal to (k-1 +d)! / (k-1)! ). Then divided by d! gives C(k-1 +d, d).

But calculating (k-1 +d)! mod MOD is impossible when k is 1e9, but we can't compute factorials that large. However, the product (k) * (k+1) * ... * (k +d-1) can be computed as follows:

We need to compute the product of d terms starting from k. For example, when d=3: k * (k+1) * (k+2). This can be computed iteratively for each d.

So for each d from 0 to 2000, the product is:

if d ==0: 1 (since C(n,0) is 1).

else: product_{i=0 to d-1} (k +i) mod MOD.

So for a given d, the product is the product of k to k+d-1, inclusive. Then, multiply this product by the inverse of d! mod MOD to get the binomial coefficient.

Wait, the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) is equal to product_{i=0 to d-1} (k +d -1 - i) ) / d! = product_{i=0 to d-1} (k +d -1 -i) / d! = [ (k +d -1) * (k +d -2) * ... *k ] / d! ?

Wait, no. Let's take n = k-1 +d. Then, C(n, d) = n!/(d! (n-d)!) ). Since n -d = k-1 +d -d = k-1.

So C(n, d) = ( (k-1 +d) * (k-1 +d -1) * ... * (k) ) ) / (d! )

Because n! = (k-1 +d)! = (k-1 +d) * ... * (k) * (k-1) * ... * 1. But (n-d)! is (k-1)! So n!/(n-d)! = (k-1 +d) * ... * k) * (k-1) ... 1 ) / ( (k-1) ... 1 ) ) = (k-1 +d) * ... *k )

So the numerator is the product from k to k-1 +d, which is the product of d terms: k, k+1, ..., k +d-1. Because (k-1 +d) = k +d-1 -1 +1? Wait, k-1 +d = k +d-1.

Yes. So the product is (k) * (k+1) * ... * (k +d-1). That's d terms.

So for each d, the binomial coefficient is (product of d terms from k) multiplied by inv_fact[d] mod MOD.

So the plan is:

- Precompute factorials up to 2000 and their inverses modulo MOD.

- For each d in 0..2000, compute the product P = 1. For each i in 0 to d-1: P = P * (k + i) mod MOD. Then multiply by inv_fact[d] to get the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) mod MOD.

But wait, when k is 0, then the operation is applied 0 times, so the array remains the same. So in code, we first handle the case where k=0, output the original array.

Otherwise, for k operations, each element in the new array is the sum over j=1 to i of a_j * C(k-1 + (i-j), k-1) mod MOD.

But since i-j can be up to 1999 (since i is up to 2000 and j starts from 1), for each i, j can be from 1 to i, and d = i-j. So for each i, and for each j from 1 to i, d = i-j. So for each i, we can precompute the coefficients for d from 0 to i-1 (since j can be 1, so d = i-1, down to j= i, d=0).

Wait, j ranges from 1 to i. For j in 1..i, d = i-j. So d ranges from i-1 (when j=1) down to 0 (when j=i). So for each i, the possible d's are 0, 1, ..., i-1. But i can be up to 2000, so the maximum d is 1999.

So for each i in 1..n, compute the sum of a[j] * C(k-1 +d, d), where d = i-j.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 2000.

2. For each d from 0 to 2000, precompute the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) mod MOD. Let's call this coeff[d].

3. For each i from 1 to n, compute the sum over j from 1 to i of a[j] * coeff[i-j], mod MOD.

But how to handle this when k=0? Because if k=0, we need to return the original array. So in code, first check if k is zero, and return the array as is.

So, the main steps are:

- Compute coeff[d] for d in 0..2000.

- For each i, compute the sum of a[j-1] * coeff[i-j], where j ranges from 1 to i. Note that in Python, the array is 0-based, so a[j] corresponds to a_{j+1} in the problem statement.

Wait, the input is given as a list of n elements, a_1 to a_n. So in code, when we read them into a list, say 'a', then a[0] is a_1, a[1] is a_2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, the input is a_1 to a_n. So when we read the list, it's [a1, a2, ..., an], which would be stored as a list in Python. So in code, for j in 1..i (1-based), the Python index is j-1. So for the original a_j, the code's index is j-1.

So for each i (1-based in the problem), the code's index is i-1. So for example, the first element (i=1 in problem) is a[0] in the list.

So, for each i in 1..n (problem's 1-based), which is index i-1 in code:

sum = 0

for j in 1..i (problem's j):

sum += a[j-1] * coeff[i - j]

sum mod MOD.

So, the code can be structured as:

read n, k

read the list a.

if k ==0:

    print a as is.

else:

    compute coeff[d] for d in 0..n-1 (since the maximum i-j is (2000-1) for i=2000 and j=1).

    for each i in 1..n:

        sum =0

        for j in 1..i:

            d = i-j

            sum += a[j-1] * coeff[d]

        sum %= MOD

        output sum

But this is O(n^2), which for n=2000 is 4 million operations. That's acceptable, as 4 million operations are manageable within 4 seconds (each operation is a multiply and add, but even in Python, 4 million steps are okay).

So the key steps are:

1. Precompute inv_fact up to 2000.

2. Precompute coeff[d] for d up to 2000.

Now, let's code this.

First, precompute factorial and inv factorial modulo MOD.

MOD = 1e9+7.

But how to compute inv_fact?

We can compute fact[d] = d! mod MOD, for d up to 2000.

Then compute inv_fact[d] = pow(fact[d], MOD-2, MOD), using Fermat's little theorem.

So code steps for precomputing fact and inv_fact:

max_d = 2000

fact = [1]*(max_d+1)

for i in 1 to max_d:

    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(max_d+1)

inv_fact[max_d] = pow(fact[max_d], MOD-2, MOD)

for i in max_d-1 downto 0:

    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

Once we have fact and inv_fact, then for each d, compute coeff[d] as follows:

if d ==0:

    coeff[0] = 1 (since C(k-1+0, 0) is 1 for any k).

else:

    product = 1

    for x in 0 to d-1:

        term = (k + x) % MOD

        product = product * term % MOD

    coeff[d] = product * inv_fact[d] % MOD

Wait, but for each d, the product is product of (k +x) for x in 0..d-1.

But when k is up to 1e9, (k +x) mod MOD can be computed as (k mod MOD +x) mod MOD. Because adding x (which is up to 1999) to k mod MOD may overflow MOD, but the mod is handled.

Yes. So for each x in 0..d-1:

term = (k % MOD + x) % MOD

So, even if k is 1e9, k mod MOD is 1e9%1e9+7 = 1e9 - (1e9+7)*0 = 1e9. But 1e9+7 is 1e9+7, so 1e9 is less than that, so k mod MOD is just k when k < MOD. But since k can be up to 1e9, which is less than MOD (1e9+7), so k mod MOD is k.

Wait, MOD is 1e9+7. So for k <=1e9+7-1, mod is k. So when k is up to 1e9, it's correct.

So when d is 2000, the product is the product of (k + x) mod MOD for x from 0 to 1999.

So, the code for precomputing coeff would be:

coeff = [0]*(2001)  # since d can be up to 2000 (if i=2000 and j=0, but j starts from 1, so d=1999).

Wait, for j in 1..i, d = i-j. So when i is 2000 and j is 1, d=1999. So the maximum d is 1999. So coeff needs to be precomputed for d up to 1999.

Wait, the maximum possible i-j is (n-1) when n is up to 2000. So d can be up to 1999.

So in code, max_d = 2000 (but for d up to 1999). So for d in 0..1999.

But in code, perhaps it's easier to precompute coeff up to 2000, but in practice, the loops will handle up to the required d.

So for each d from 0 to 2000:

coeff[d] = ?

But perhaps for the code, when n is up to 2000, the maximum d is 1999, so precompute up to 1999.

But to be safe, let's precompute up to 2000.

So in code:

coeff = [0] * (n) # but n can be 2000, and d up to i-j=1999.

Wait, no, for a given d, the maximum is 1999. So the code can precompute for d in 0 to 2000 (since for n=2000, the maximum d is 1999). So no problem.

So, for each d in 0..2000:

if d ==0:

    coeff[0] =1

else:

    product =1

    for x in 0 to d-1:

        term = (k +x) % MOD

        product = product * term % MOD

    coeff[d] = product * inv_fact[d] % MOD

But wait, for the binomial coefficient C(k-1 +d, d) mod MOD. So when k is zero? No, because k is the number of operations. Wait, in the code, when k is zero, we handle that case separately. So when we compute coeff, k is >=1.

So during coeff computation, k is at least 1.

But wait, in code, when k is zero, we output the original array. So in the code, the coeff is only computed when k>0.

So that's handled.

Now, code steps:

Read n, k.

a = list of n integers.

if k ==0:

    print ' '.join(map(str, a))

else:

    precompute fact and inv_fact up to 2000.

    compute coeff for d from 0 to 2000.

    then for each i from 1 to n:

        sum =0

        for j from 1 to i:

            d = i -j

            sum += a[j-1] * coeff[d]

        sum %= MOD

        append to result.

    print the result.

But in Python, for n=2000, the loops are 2000 * 2000 =4e6 steps. Which is manageable.

Now, let's test with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

3 1

1 2 3

k=1.

Compute coeff[d] for d=0,1,2 (since i can be up to 3, j up to 3, d up to 2).

For d=0: coeff[0] =1.

For d=1: product is (1+0) =1. inv_fact[1] =1. So coeff[1] =1 *1=1.

For d=2: product is 1*2=2. inv_fact[2] = 500000004 (since 2! =2, inv(2) mod 1e9+7 is 500000004). So coeff[2] =2 *500000004 mod MOD = 1.

But wait, when k=1, the binomial coefficient is C(1-1 +d, d) = C(d, d) =1 for any d. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, when k=1, coeff[d] = C( (1-1) +d, d) = C(d, d) =1. So for any d, coeff[d] is 1.

So for the first sample, after one operation, each a_i is sum_{j=1}^i a_j * 1. Which is the partial sum. So the output is 1, 3, 6. Which matches the sample.

So the code should compute coeff[d] =1 for all d. Let's see:

for k=1, in code:

for d=0:

coeff[0] =1.

d=1:

product = (1+0) =1 mod MOD.

inv_fact[1] is 1.

so 1 *1 =1.

d=2:

product = (1+0) * (1+1) =1*2=2 mod MOD.

inv_fact[2] is inv(2) mod MOD, which is 500000004.

so 2 *500000004 mod MOD is 1.

So coeff[2] is 1.

d=3:

product = (1+0)*(1+1)*(1+2) =1*2*3=6.

inv_fact[3] is inv(6) mod MOD.

6 * inv(6) mod MOD is 1.

So yes, for all d, coeff[d] is 1. So the code works for the first sample.

Sample 2:

Input is k=0, so output the same array. That's handled.

So the code should work.

Now, the code in Python:

But let's code this.

First, precompute fact and inv_fact.

Then, compute coeff.

Then, compute the result.

Handle k=0.

Now, code:

MOD = 10**9 +7

n, k = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if k ==0:

    print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

else:

    max_d = 2000  # since n can be up to 2000, and d up to 1999.

    # Precompute fact and inv_fact up to max_d.

    fact = [1]*(max_d+1)

    for i in range(1, max_d+1):

        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD

    inv_fact = [1]*(max_d+1)

    inv_fact[max_d] = pow(fact[max_d], MOD-2, MOD)

    for i in range(max_d-1, -1, -1):

        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

    # Precompute coeff for d from 0 to 2000.

    coeff = [0]*(max_d +1)

    for d in range(0, max_d +1):

        if d ==0:

            coeff[d] =1

        else:

            product = 1

            for x in range(d):

                term = (k +x) % MOD

                product = product * term % MOD

            coeff[d] = product * inv_fact[d] % MOD

    # Compute the result.

    res = []

    for i in range(1, n+1):

        s =0

        for j in range(1, i+1):

            d = i -j

            s += a[j-1] * coeff[d]

            s %= MOD

        res.append(s % MOD)

    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

But wait, the max_d is set to 2000. But in the code, when n is 2000, the maximum d is i-j where i can be 2000 and j=1, so d=1999. So in the coeff array, we need to compute up to d=1999. So setting max_d to 2000 is safe, but in practice, for d=2000, we don't use it. So the code is correct.

But in the code, when d runs up to max_d (2000), but for j in 1..i, the d is up to i-1. Since i can be up to 2000, the maximum d is 1999. So for d=2000, the code computes coeff[2000], but it's never used. So no problem.

But perhaps in code, max_d can be set to 1999. But for n=2000, it's okay.

Now, let's test the code with the sample input 1.

Sample Input 1:

3 1

1 2 3

In code, k=1. max_d is 2000.

Compute coeff for d=0:1.

d=1:

product is (1+0) =1. inv_fact[1] is 1. So coeff[1]=1.

d=2:

product is 1*2=2. inv_fact[2] is 500000004. 2*500000004 mod MOD is 1.

Similarly for d=3, product is 6, inv_fact[3] is 166666668 (since 3! is 6, inv(6) is 166666668). 6 * 166666668 mod MOD is 1.

So for all d, coeff[d] is 1. So the sum for each i is sum of a_j's from j=1 to i, which gives 1, 3,6.

Sample 2: k=0, output is same.

So code works.

Now, what about when k is large, say k=1e9.

But the code computes coeff[d] as product of (k +x) mod MOD for x in 0..d-1, multiplied by inv_fact[d].

For example, when d=2 and k=1e9:

product = (1e9) * (1e9 +1) mod MOD.

But since 1e9 is 1e9, and MOD is 1e9+7.

1e9 mod MOD is 1e9.

1e9 +1 mod MOD is 1e9 +1.

So product = (1e9) * (1e9+1) mod MOD.

Then multiplied by inv_fact[2] which is 500000004.

So, the code correctly computes the binomial coefficients modulo MOD.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, to optimize the code for speed. The current code has nested loops: the outer loop is O(n) and the inner loop is O(n), leading to O(n^2) time. For n=2000, that's 4 million steps, which should be manageable in Python. But we can try to optimize further.

But in Python, list comprehensions or precomputing the coefficients once is already done.

Another possible optimization: precompute the coeff array up to 2000, but in practice, for each i, the maximum d is i-1. Since i is up to 2000, the maximum d is 1999. So setting max_d=2000 is sufficient.

Thus, the code should work correctly and efficiently.
