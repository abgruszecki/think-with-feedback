<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about two arrays A and B. We can perform operations where we replace a consecutive subsegment with the sum of that subsegment. The goal is to make the two arrays equal after some operations, and we need the maximum possible length of the resulting arrays. If it's impossible, return -1.

First, I need to figure out how these operations work. Each operation allows us to merge consecutive elements into their sum. So, for example, if the array is [1,2,3], merging the first two gives [3,3], and merging all gives [6]. The key point is that merging reduces the length of the array. But we want to perform such operations on both arrays in a way that they end up the same, with the maximum possible length.

So the idea is to find a common sequence of sums that exists in both arrays when we merge some consecutive elements. The maximum possible length would be the largest number of elements that can form a matching sequence of sums in both arrays.

Wait, but how do we model the possible merged sequences? For each array, the possible merged forms are all the possible ways of grouping consecutive elements, where each group's sum is part of the new array. But since merging can be done any number of times, the possible merged arrays are all the possible sequences of partial sums where each element in the sequence is the sum of a contiguous group of the original elements, and the groups are non-overlapping and cover the entire array.

But considering all possibilities is impossible for large n and m. So we need a way to compute possible merged forms efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem as finding the longest possible sequence of prefix sums that are present in both A and B. Because each merged array corresponds to a set of prefix sums. For example, the original array's prefix sums are the cumulative sums, and each merged version is a subset of these prefix sums. For instance, in the first example, the A array is [11,2,3,5,7]. Its prefix sums are 11, 13, 16, 21, 28. The merged array after some operations could be [11, 2+3+5=10,7], which would correspond to the prefix sums 11, 21, 28. So the merged array's prefix sums must be a subset of the original array's prefix sums, and must start at 0 (if we include that) but wait, the original array's prefix sum starts at a_1, a_1+a_2, etc. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the prefix sums for array A are computed as the sum of the first k elements. For example, the original array has prefix sums S_0=0, S_1=a_1, S_2=a_1+a_2, ..., S_n=sum of all elements. Similarly for array B.

Now, when we merge some consecutive elements in the array, the merged array's elements correspond to the differences between consecutive prefix sums. For example, the original array's elements are S_1 - S_0, S_2 - S_1, etc. When we merge elements from i to j, the new element is S_j - S_{i-1}, and the merged array's elements are the differences between certain selected prefix sums.

So, the merged array's elements must form a sequence where each element is S_k - S_{l}, where l is the previous index. Thus, the merged array can be represented by a sequence of indices in the original prefix sum array. For example, the merged array is formed by selecting some indices i_0=0 < i_1 < ... < i_t = n, such that the elements are S[i_1] - S[i_0], S[i_2] - S[i_1], ..., S[i_t] - S[i_{t-1}].

But the key point is that the merged array's elements are determined by the selected indices in the prefix sum array. So, for both arrays A and B, the merged sequences must be the same. Therefore, their merged sequences must correspond to a common sequence of prefix sums in both A and B.

Wait, but how? Let's think. For array A, the merged array is determined by a sequence of prefix sums S_A[i_0], S_A[i_1], ..., S_A[i_k], where i_0=0, i_k = n. Each element in the merged array is S_A[i_j] - S_A[i_{j-1}]. Similarly for array B. So for the merged arrays to be equal, the sequences of elements (differences) must be the same. That means the sequences of differences in S_A and S_B must be identical. But the S_A and S_B themselves could be different, but their differences must form the same sequence.

Wait, but the sum of the entire arrays must be equal, otherwise it's impossible. Because merging all elements in A gives a single element equal to the total sum. Similarly for B. So the first thing to check is whether the total sum of A and B are equal. If not, output -1.

Yes. So first step: compute the sum of A and B. If they are different, return -1.

Otherwise, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of indices in the prefix sums of A and B that form the same sequence of differences. The maximum length of such a sequence would be the answer.

So the approach is:

1. Compute the total sum of A and B. If different, return -1.

2. Compute the prefix sums for A and B.

3. Find the longest common sequence of prefix sums (excluding the 0) between the two prefix sum arrays, starting from the first element (0) and ending at the total sum. The number of elements in this common sequence minus 1 gives the maximum possible length of the merged array.

Wait, because the merged array's elements are the differences between consecutive elements in the prefix sum sequence. So the length of the merged array is the number of intervals in the prefix sum indices. For example, if the prefix sums selected are S0, S2, S5, then the merged array has 2 elements (S2-S0 and S5-S2). So the length is (number of selected points) - 1.

Therefore, the maximum possible length is the maximum number of points in the intersection of the prefix sum sequences of A and B (including 0 and the total sum) minus 1.

So the problem reduces to finding the length of the longest common subsequence between the prefix sums of A and B (including the 0 and the total sum), and then subtracting 1.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

The prefix sums for A and B are sorted in increasing order (since all elements are positive). Because each element in A and B is a positive integer. So the prefix sums of A are strictly increasing. Similarly for B. So the prefix sum arrays are sorted. So the problem becomes finding the longest common subsequence between two sorted arrays, which can be done with a two-pointer approach.

Yes. Because both arrays are sorted, we can iterate through both and find the matching elements. Each time we find a match, we can increment both pointers. The number of matches (including 0 and the total sum) minus 1 gives the maximum possible length.

So the steps are:

- Compute prefix sums for A and B. Let's call them SA and SB.

- Check if the total sums (SA[-1] and SB[-1]) are equal. If not, return -1.

- Now, find the longest sequence of elements that appear in both SA and SB, in order. Since SA and SB are both sorted, we can do this efficiently with two pointers.

For example:

SA = [0, 11, 13, 16, 21, 28]

SB = [0, 11, 18, 21, 28]

The common elements are 0, 11, 21, 28. So the length is 4, resulting in 3 elements in the merged array.

Which matches the first sample input's output.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize two pointers i and j, starting at 0 for SA and SB. Then, for each step, if SA[i] == SB[j], record this as a common point and increment both i and j. Otherwise, if SA[i] < SB[j], increment i. Else, increment j. Continue until one of the pointers reaches the end.

But we need to include both the 0 and the total sum. So the initial check (sums equal) ensures that the last elements (the total sums) are equal. So the two arrays SA and SB must both end with the same value. So during the two-pointer traversal, if we reach the end of either array, we can check if the other array's remaining elements include the total sum. But since both arrays end with the same sum, we can ensure that in the end, the last element is considered.

So the code steps:

Compute SA and SB for A and B.

Check if SA[-1] == SB[-1]. If not, return -1.

Initialize i = 0, j = 0.

count = 0.

prev = 0.

Wait, let's think of the code:

sa = [0]

for num in A:

    sa.append(sa[-1] + num)

Similarly for sb.

Then, we need to find the common elements in sa and sb. The maximum possible length is the number of common elements, including 0 and the sum. Then, the answer is count - 1.

So the two-pointer approach would work as follows:

i = 0 (points to sa)

j = 0 (points to sb)

count = 0

while i < len(sa) and j < len(sb):

    if sa[i] == sb[j]:

        count +=1

        i +=1

        j +=1

    elif sa[i] < sb[j]:

        i +=1

    else:

        j +=1

But wait, this is only valid if the two arrays are sorted. Which they are. Because each element is the sum of the previous plus a positive number, so SA is strictly increasing. Similarly for SB.

So this two-pointer approach will find the maximum number of common elements in order. But since the arrays are sorted, any common elements must appear in the same order.

For example, if SA is [0, 11, 13, 16, 21, 28], and SB is [0, 11, 18, 21, 28], the two pointers would proceed as:

i=0, j=0: 0 == 0 → count=1. i=1, j=1.

i=1 (11) vs j=1 (11): count=2. i=2, j=2.

SA[2] is 13, SB[2] is 18 → 13 < 18 → i=3.

SA[3] is 16 < 18 → i=4.

SA[4] is 21 vs SB[2] 18 → 21 > 18 → j=3.

SB[3] is 21: SA[4] equals SB[3] → count=3. i=5, j=4.

Now SA[5] is 28, SB[4] is 28 → count=4. i=6 (out of bounds?), j=5 (out of bounds).

So total count is 4 → answer 4-1=3.

Which is correct.

Another example: if the arrays are identical, then the count is len(sa) = len(sb) → answer is len(sa) -1.

So the code seems correct.

Now, considering the constraints. The arrays can be up to 3e5 elements, so the prefix sums arrays can be up to 3e5 +1 elements each. The two-pointer approach is O(n + m), which is acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Read n, read array A.

- Read m, read array B.

- Compute SA and SB.

- Check if SA[-1] != SB[-1], return -1.

- Use two pointers to count the number of common elements in SA and SB.

- If the count is at least 2 (since 0 and total sum are included), then the answer is count-1. Else, if the count is 1 (only 0 and sum?), but the sum is non-zero, then perhaps only 0 and sum are present. But wait, SA and SB both start with 0 and end with sum. So in the two-pointer approach, the first element is 0, and the last element is sum. So the count is at least 2 if the sum is non-zero. Wait, if sum is zero, but the problem states that the elements of A and B are at least 1. So sum can't be zero. So SA and SB will always have 0 and sum, which is non-zero. So the count is at least 2.

Wait, but what if sum is zero? But according to the problem statement, each element in A and B is >=1. So sum can't be zero. So SA and SB are at least length 2 (0 and sum). So the two-pointer approach will have count >= 2. So the maximum possible length is count-1, which is at least 1.

But when sum is same, but there are no other common elements, then the maximum length is 1. For example, if A is [1], B is [1]. Then SA is [0,1], SB is [0,1]. Then the count is 2 → answer 1. Which is correct.

Another example: A is [1,2], B is [3]. Then SA is [0,1,3], SB is [0,3]. The common elements are 0 and 3. So count is 2 → answer 1.

So the code would output 1, which is correct.

Now, what about when the sum is same, but there are no overlapping prefix sums except 0 and sum?

For example, A is [2,2], sum 4. SA is [0,2,4]. B is [1,3], sum 4. SB is [0,1,4]. The common elements are 0 and 4. So count is 2 → answer 1. So the maximum length is 1. The merged arrays can be [4] for both, which is length 1.

But the problem says to find the maximum possible length. So in this case, even though the sum is the same, but the only way to have the arrays equal is to have them both as [4], length 1.

So the code is correct.

Now, code steps.

In Python, reading the input:

Read n.

Read the next line as list of integers for A.

Read m.

Read the next line as list of integers for B.

Compute SA and SB:

sa = [0]

current = 0

for a in A:

    current += a

    sa.append(current)

Similarly for sb.

Check if sa[-1] != sb[-1], return -1.

Else, do two pointers.

Initialize i = 0, j = 0, count =0.

Loop:

while i < len(sa) and j < len(sb):

    if sa[i] == sb[j]:

        count +=1

        i +=1

        j +=1

    elif sa[i] < sb[j]:

        i +=1

    else:

        j +=1

If after this, i and j have not processed all elements up to the sum? Wait, no. Because sa and sb both end with the sum. So the loop will process all elements up to the sum. Because after the loop ends, either i is at len(sa) or j is at len(sb). But since sa[-1] == sb[-1], which is the sum, the loop would have processed both.

So the count will include the sum as the last element.

Thus, the answer is count-1.

So, in code:

print(count-1 if count >= 2 else -1)

But wait, the count can't be less than 2. Because sum is same and each array's sa and sb start with 0 and end with sum. So the first element is 0, which is in both. The last element is sum, which is in both. So the two-pointer approach will at least count 0 and sum. So count will be at least 2. So the answer is always count-1. Unless the sum is zero, but according to the constraints, sum is sum of 1e9 elements, which is at least 1. So the answer is count-1.

Thus, code can return count-1.

So putting it all together:

Read n, read A.

Read m, read B.

Compute sa and sb.

if sa[-1] != sb[-1], output -1.

Else:

i = j = 0

count = 0

while i < len(sa) and j < len(sb):

    if sa[i] == sb[j]:

        count +=1

        i +=1

        j +=1

    elif sa[i] < sb[j]:

        i +=1

    else:

        j +=1

output count -1.

Now, considering the constraints for Python.

The arrays can be up to 3e5 elements, so the prefix sums for each can be up to 3e5 +1 elements. But in Python, building lists of that size is manageable. Each element is a 64-bit integer, but Python can handle that.

But what about the time? For 3e5 elements, building the prefix sum array is O(n), which is acceptable. The two-pointer approach is O(n + m), which is also acceptable.

So this should work.

Testing the first example:

Sample Input 1:

5

11 2 3 5 7

4

11 7 3 7

sa is computed as:

0, 11, 13, 16, 21, 28

sb is:

0, 11, 18, 21, 28.

The common elements are 0,11,21,28 → count=4 → 4-1=3 → correct.

Sample Input 2:

2

1 2

1

100 → sum A is 3, sum B is 100 → output -1.

Sample Input3:

3

1 2 3

3

1 2 3 → sa is 0,1,3,6. sb is same. count is 4 → 4-1=3 → correct.

Another test case where sum is same but no other common elements:

A = [2,2], B = [1,3]

sa = [0,2,4]

sb = [0,1,4]

common elements are 0,4 → count=2 → answer 1.

Another test case where A and B have overlapping elements:

A = [1,1], B = [2].

sa = [0,1,2]

sb = [0,2]

common elements are 0,2 → count=2 → answer 1.

Yes.

So the code should work.

Thus, the code is as follows.
