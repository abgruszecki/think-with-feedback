<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if we can construct a binary search tree (BST) from the given sorted list of nodes such that any two connected nodes (parent and child) have a GCD greater than 1. Hmm.

First, I need to recall the BST structure. In a BST, for every node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater. Since the input is given in ascending order, the BST structure is essentially the structure of a binary search tree that can be formed by choosing a root and recursively building left and right subtrees from the elements before and after the root in the array. Wait, but the array is sorted. So the BST must be built such that the in-order traversal is the same as the given array, which is already sorted. So the structure of the BST is determined by choosing the root (which can be any element), then the left subtree is built from the elements before the root in the array, and the right subtree from the elements after. This makes sense.

But the main condition here is that any parent and child must have a GCD greater than 1. So for each possible parent in the BST, its children must share a common divisor greater than 1 with it.

So the approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where for a range of nodes (i to j), we determine if there's a possible root such that the root can connect to its parent (if any) with GCD >1, and then the left and right subtrees also satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but how do we model the parent's value here? Because the root of the entire tree doesn't have a parent, so any node could be the root. Then, for each possible root, check if the left and right subtrees can be built with their respective parents (the root) having a GCD >1. Then recursively, for each subtree, the new root must have GCD >1 with its parent.

This sounds like a DP problem where we track for each possible interval [i, j], and a possible parent (from left or right), whether it's possible to construct the subtree such that the parent and the root of the subtree have GCD >1.

Alternatively, since the parent is part of the adjacent intervals, maybe we can model the DP as follows:

Let dp[i][j][k] represent whether the subtree consisting of nodes a[i..j] can be formed such that the parent (if exists) of the root of this subtree has a value that allows a GCD >1 with the root. Wait, but tracking the parent's value for every interval is not feasible because n can be up to 700, leading to O(n^3) states which might be manageable? Let's see. For n=700, n^3 is 700^3 = 343 million, which is way too big. So that's not feasible.

Hmm. So we need a smarter way. Let's think differently. For each interval [l, r], and for each possible parent (either the parent is to the left of the interval or to the right), we need to track if there exists a root in [l, r] such that when you split into left and right subtrees, their roots can connect properly. Wait, but perhaps the parent's value is not needed as long as the root of the current subtree has a value that is compatible with its parent.

Wait, the parent of the current subtree's root is determined outside of this interval. So for the root of [l..r], when building the tree, the parent could be some node that was chosen higher up in the tree. But how can we model that without knowing the parent's value?

Ah, maybe we can precompute for all possible pairs (a, b) whether their GCD is >1. Then, for each interval [l, r], and for each possible possible direction (left or right), track whether there's a root in [l..r] that can have a parent in the left (for example, the parent would be in the interval to the left of l) or right (parent would be in the interval to the right of r). Wait, perhaps we can model this with two DP tables: left and right.

Wait, here's an idea. Let's define two DP tables:

- left[i][j] = True if the subtree consisting of nodes a[i..j] can be built such that the root of this subtree has a parent on the left (i.e., the parent is in the array before index i). So the root's parent would be in a position less than i. Therefore, when building the subtree a[i..j], the root must have a parent (which is outside of this subtree) that has a GCD >1 with it.

Similarly, right[i][j] = True if the subtree a[i..j] can be built such that the root has a parent on the right (i.e., the parent is in the array after index j). 

Then, for the entire problem, the answer is whether there exists a root k (from 0 to n-1) such that the left subtree is a[0..k-1], the right subtree is a[k+1..n-1], and the left subtree can be built with the parent being the root (so the left subtree's root must have a parent (the root) that has a GCD >1 with it). Similarly for the right subtree.

Wait, but for the entire tree, the root doesn't have a parent. So when we choose the root for the entire array [0..n-1], there's no parent. So the left subtree's root must be compatible with the root (the parent), and the right subtree's root must also be compatible. But in the DP, the left and right subtrees need to have their own compatibility. 

So, the approach would be:

For each possible root k in [0..n-1], check if:

- The left subtree [0..k-1] can be built with the root's parent being a[k], which requires that GCD(a[k], left_root) >1. So for the left subtree [0..k-1], the parent is on the right (since a[k] is to the right of [0..k-1]), so we check if right[0][k-1] is possible. Wait, no. Because right[i][j] represents that the parent is on the right. So for the left subtree of k, the parent is a[k], which is on the right of [0..k-1]. Therefore, the left subtree must have a root that is compatible with a[k]. So the left subtree's structure must allow for the root to have a parent on the right (which is a[k]). So in this case, the left subtree's [0..k-1] can be built with a parent on the right, meaning that right[0][k-1] is true. But also, the root of the left subtree (say, m) must have GCD(a[m], a[k]) >1. Similarly for the right subtree.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The DP approach could be as follows:

We can define a DP table where for each interval [l..r], and for possible parent directions (left or right), we track whether it's possible to form a valid subtree.

The key insight is that when building a subtree for nodes [l..r], the root of this subtree must have a parent that is either to the left of l (so the parent is in the array before l) or to the right of r (parent is in the array after r). For each such case, the root must have a GCD >1 with that parent. However, since the parent is not part of the current subtree, we don't track its value, but track the possibility that such a parent exists.

So, for the interval [l..r], the root can be any node in [l..r]. Let's say we choose m as the root. Then, the left subtree is [l..m-1] and the right subtree is [m+1..r]. The root m must have a parent that's either in the left (if the parent is in the left of l) or right (if the parent is in the right of r). Then, for the left subtree [l..m-1], the parent is m, which is to the right of the interval [l..m-1], so the left subtree must be compatible with a parent on the right. Similarly, the right subtree [m+1..r] must be compatible with a parent on the left (since the parent is m, which is to the left of the interval [m+1..r]).

Wait, no. Let's see: the root m has a parent. If the current interval's parent is on the left (i.e., the parent is in the array before l), then the root m's parent is that node. Then, the left and right subtrees of m must be built such that their roots are compatible with m. 

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is:

For each interval [l..r], and possible parent positions (left or right), determine if there exists a root m in [l..r] such that:

- If the parent is on the left (i.e., the parent is in the array before l), then the GCD between a[m] and the parent is >1. But since the parent is not part of the subtree, but the subtree's root m is connected to it, we can't track the parent's value. So, perhaps the DP state is whether the interval [l..r] can form a subtree where the root is compatible with a parent that is on the left (i.e., to the left of l) or on the right (to the right of r).

But how do we check the GCD between the root m and the parent? Because the parent is outside the interval, but in the case of the entire tree, the root has no parent. So the initial problem is to check if any of the possible roots of the entire array (with no parent) can have their left and right subtrees compatible with them.

So the DP states are:

- can_left[l][r]: whether the interval [l..r] can form a subtree where the root has a parent to the left (i.e., the parent is in a position < l), and GCD(a[root], parent) > 1.

- can_right[l][r]: whether the interval [l..r] can form a subtree where the root has a parent to the right (i.e., parent is in a position > r), and GCD(a[root], parent) >1.

For the entire tree, the root has no parent, so the entire interval [0..n-1] must be able to form a subtree without a parent. But how does that fit into the DP? Because in that case, the root can be any m, and the left and right subtrees must be compatible with m as their parent.

Wait, for the entire tree, the root m must have a left child and/or right child (depending on the subtree's structure). But the root itself has no parent, so the DP for the entire tree is to check if there exists an m such that:

- The left subtree [0..m-1] can be formed with m as the parent (so the left subtree's root must have a GCD>1 with m), which implies that the left subtree's root's parent is m, which is to the right of the left subtree. So the left subtree's can_right[0][m-1] must be True, and the root of the left subtree (say, x) must have a GCD>1 with m. Wait, but how do we check that? Because can_right[0][m-1] is True if there exists a way to form the left subtree such that its root has a parent to the right (which is m). But the root of the left subtree (x) must have a GCD>1 with m. So for the left subtree, when we choose x as its root, the parent is m (which is to the right of the left subtree's interval [0..m-1]). So the GCD(a[x], a[m]) must be >1.

But how does the DP account for that?

Alternatively, perhaps the DP states should track for each interval [l..r] and possible parent position (left or right) whether there exists a root m in [l..r] such that:

1. For can_left[l][r] (parent is to the left of l), the GCD between a[m] and the parent is >1.

2. The left subtree [l..m-1] can be formed with m as the parent (so the left subtree's parent is m, which is to the right of the left subtree's interval, so the left subtree must have can_right[l][m-1] True, and the root of the left subtree must have GCD>1 with m).

Similarly for the right subtree.

Wait, but the left subtree's root must have a GCD>1 with m. So when building the DP for the left subtree [l..m-1], the root must be compatible with m. So during the DP transitions, when considering can_right[l][m-1], that subtree's root must have a GCD>1 with the parent (m), which is to the right. So can_right[l][m-1] being True means that such a subtree exists, but the root of that subtree must have a GCD>1 with m. So how do we track that in the DP?

This is the crux of the problem. The DP must not only track whether a subtree can be formed with a parent in a certain direction but also that the root of the subtree has a GCD>1 with that parent.

But since the parent's value is not known when building the DP for the subtree, this seems impossible. However, the parent's value is known when considering the transitions. For example, when considering the entire tree's root m, the left subtree's parent is m. So when building the left subtree, the GCD between the left subtree's root and m must be >1. So, the can_right for the left subtree would need to be true, and the root of the left subtree (which is the first node in the left subtree's hierarchy) must have a GCD>1 with m.

But how do we model this? Because the root of the left subtree is not fixed; it depends on how the subtree is built. So for the left subtree [l..m-1], the root can be any node in that interval, and we need that node to have a GCD>1 with m.

This suggests that for each interval [l..r] and direction (left or right parent), the DP should track whether there exists a root in that interval such that:

1. The root is compatible with the parent (which is either to the left of l or to the right of r, and whose value we don't know here, but when building the parent, which is in a certain direction, the GCD between the root and that parent's value must be >1).

But how do we check that GCD when the parent's value is unknown? Unless we precompute for all possible possible parent values in the left or right direction, but that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the parent's value is not part of the subtree being considered. For example, when the parent is to the left of the interval [l..r], the parent's value could be any a[i] where i < l. However, since the array is sorted, the parent in the BST would have to be a node such that the interval [l..r] is a left or right subtree of that parent. But the BST structure enforces that all nodes in the left subtree are less than the parent, and right subtree are greater. Wait, no. Wait, in a BST, the left subtree of a node contains nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key. So given that the array is sorted, the BST's in-order traversal is the same as the array. So, any subtree [l..r] must form a BST where the root is somewhere in the middle, and the left and right subtrees are built from the left and right parts.

But the parent of the subtree's root must be either the first node to the left of l or the first node to the right of r in the array. Because the entire array is sorted, and the subtree [l..r] is a contiguous segment. For example, if the subtree is [2..5], then the parent of the root of this subtree must be either in [0..1] (if this subtree is a right child of a node in 0..1) or in [6..n-1] (if this subtree is a left child of a node in 6..n-1). But according to the BST structure, the parent must be such that all nodes in the subtree [l..r] are either in the left or right subtree of the parent. 

Wait, that complicates things. Because the parent of the subtree [l..r] must have a value such that all elements in [l..r] are either less than it (if the subtree is the left child of the parent) or greater than it (if it's the right child). But since the array is sorted in ascending order, the parent of a left subtree must be the next element to the right of the subtree. Similarly, the parent of a right subtree must be the next element to the left of the subtree. 

For example, if the subtree is [l..r], and the parent is to the left (i.e., the subtree is a right child of the parent), then the parent's value must be the maximum possible in the nodes before l. But wait, the array is sorted, so the parent of a right subtree [l..r] must be the element at position l-1. Similarly, the parent of a left subtree [l..r] must be the element at position r+1. Because in the sorted array, the parent of a right child is the first node before the subtree. Because all elements in the subtree are greater than the parent.

Wait, this is a crucial insight. Let me think: since the array is sorted, the BST structure must have the following properties. For any node in the array, the left child is in the left part of the array, and the right child is in the right part. But more precisely, the BST must be constructed such that for any subtree [l..r], the parent of the root of this subtree must be either the element immediately to the left of l (if the subtree is a right child of that element) or immediately to the right of r (if the subtree is a left child of that element).

Because the array is sorted in ascending order. For example, consider a subtree [i..j]. If this subtree is the right child of a node k, then k must be the last node before i, i.e., k = i-1. Because all nodes in [i..j] are greater than k. Similarly, if the subtree is the left child of a node m, then m must be the first node after j, i.e., m = j+1. Because all nodes in the subtree are less than m.

This is a critical observation. Because in the BST, when you choose a root for the subtree [l..r], the parent of that root must be either l-1 (if the subtree is a right child) or r+1 (if it's a left child). Because the array is sorted, the parent must be adjacent to the subtree in the array. Otherwise, there's a contradiction. For example, if the subtree is the right child of a node k where k < l-1, then the nodes between k+1 and l-1 would have to be part of the left subtree of k, which they aren't. So the parent must be adjacent.

Therefore, for any subtree [l..r], the parent can only be l-1 (if the subtree is a right child) or r+1 (if it's a left child). This reduces the problem to considering only these two possibilities for the parent of any subtree.

That's a huge simplification! So now, the parent of a subtree [l..r] must be either l-1 or r+1, if those indices are valid. 

So, the problem becomes: for each interval [l..r], can we choose a root m such that:

1. If the parent is l-1 (i.e., the subtree is a right child of l-1), then GCD(a[m], a[l-1]) >1.

2. The left and right subtrees (if they exist) are valid.

OR

3. If the parent is r+1 (i.e., the subtree is a left child of r+1), then GCD(a[m], a[r+1]) >1.

4. Again, the left and right subtrees must be valid.

Additionally, for the root of the entire tree (which has no parent), we need to check if there exists a root m such that:

- The left subtree [0..m-1] can be built as a left child of m (but since m is the root, the parent is non-existent, but the left subtree must be a valid subtree with parent m (i.e., the left subtree is a left child of m?), which may not be possible. Wait, the root has no parent. So the left and right subtrees of the root must be valid with m as their parent.

Wait, no. The root's left child must be part of the left subtree [0..m-1], and the root's right child must be part of the right subtree [m+1..n-1]. For each of these subtrees, their parent is m, so they must have a GCD>1 with m. Also, their own subtrees must be valid.

But according to the previous conclusion, for the left subtree [0..m-1], its parent must be m, which is to the right of the interval [0..m-1]. So the left subtree's parent is r+1 (since the interval is [0..m-1], r is m-1, so r+1 is m). Therefore, the left subtree must be a left child of m. But according to the BST structure, the left subtree of m must contain all elements less than m. Which is exactly the case here, as the array is sorted. So the left subtree [0..m-1] is the left child of m. Therefore, the parent of the left subtree is m, which is the r+1 (m = (m-1) + 1). So the condition is that the root of the left subtree must have a GCD>1 with m. Similarly for the right subtree.

But how do we model this with the DP?

The key is that for each interval [l..r], the possible parent is either l-1 (if the subtree is a right child) or r+1 (if it's a left child). So for each interval [l..r], we can track whether it's possible to form a subtree that is a left child of r+1 (parent is r+1) or a right child of l-1 (parent is l-1).

So the DP can be structured with two boolean tables:

- left_child[l][r] = True if the interval [l..r] can form a subtree that is a left child of its parent (which is at r+1). For this to be possible, there must exist a root m in [l..r] such that GCD(a[m], a[r+1]) > 1 (since the parent is at r+1 and the subtree is a left child), and the left and right subtrees of m (within [l..r]) must be valid.

- right_child[l][r] = True if the interval [l..r] can form a subtree that is a right child of its parent (which is at l-1). For this to be possible, there must exist a root m in [l..r] such that GCD(a[m], a[l-1]) >1, and the left and right subtrees of m must be valid.

Additionally, for the entire tree (interval [0..n-1]), since there's no parent, the root m must be such that the left and right subtrees can form valid left and right children of m. That is, the left subtree [0..m-1] must be a valid left child of m (so left_child[0][m-1] must be True, but since the parent is m, which is not part of the left subtree, the parent of the left subtree is m (which is at position m). For the left subtree [0..m-1], the parent is r+1 (where r = m-1), so r+1 = m. So the left subtree must be a left child of m, so left_child[0][m-1] must be True. Similarly, the right subtree [m+1..n-1] must be a right child of m, so right_child[m+1][n-1] must be True.

Wait, but for the right subtree [m+1..n-1], the parent is m, which is to the left of m+1. So the subtree is a right child of m, which is at position m. So the parent is l-1 for the interval [m+1..n-1], where l = m+1. So l-1 = m. Therefore, the right subtree must be a right child of m, so right_child[m+1][n-1] must be True, and the root of the right subtree must have GCD(a[m], a[root]) >1.

Wait, but the right_child[m+1][n-1] being True means that the subtree [m+1..n-1] can form a right child of l-1 = m. So the root of this subtree must have GCD(a[m], a[root]) >1. So for the entire tree, for a root m, the left subtree is [0..m-1], which must be a left child of m (so left_child[0][m-1] must be True). But the left_child[0][m-1] being True implies that the subtree is a left child of (m-1 +1) = m. So the root of the left subtree must have a GCD>1 with a[m]. Similarly, the right subtree [m+1..n-1] must be a right child of m (since l-1 = m for this interval). So right_child[m+1][n-1] must be True, which requires that the root of the right subtree has GCD>1 with a[m].

Therefore, the approach is as follows:

We precompute for all pairs (i, j) whether GCD(a[i], a[j]) >1.

Then, we use dynamic programming to fill the left_child and right_child tables.

The base case is when l == r (a single node). For left_child[l][r], since the subtree is a left child of r+1 (if r+1 is a valid index), then the root is l (since it's the only node), and the GCD(a[l], a[r+1]) must be >1. Similarly, for right_child[l][r], the GCD(a[l], a[l-1]) must be >1. Also, since there are no left or right subtrees (as l == r), they are trivially valid.

For the general case (l < r), to compute left_child[l][r], we need to choose a root m in [l..r], and check:

1. GCD(a[m], a[r+1]) >1 (since the subtree is a left child of r+1).

2. The left part [l..m-1] must form a valid left child of m (so left_child[l][m-1] must be True).

3. The right part [m+1..r] must form a valid right child of m (so right_child[m+1][r] must be True).

But wait, the left part [l..m-1] is the left child of m. Since m's parent is r+1, the left part's parent is m, which is part of the current subtree. So for the left part [l..m-1], its parent is m. But according to the BST structure, the parent of [l..m-1] must be m, which is at position m. So the left part [l..m-1] is a left child of m (since the parent is m, which is to the right of the interval [l..m-1], so r+1 for [l..m-1] is m. So the left part [l..m-1] must be a left child of m, hence left_child[l][m-1] must be True. Similarly, the right part [m+1..r] is a right child of m, so right_child[m+1][r] must be True.

But how does that fit into the DP transitions?

For left_child[l][r] (the subtree is a left child of r+1):

We need to choose a root m in [l..r] such that:

- GCD(a[m], a[r+1]) >1.

- The left subtree [l..m-1] can be a left child of m. So left_child[l][m-1] must be True.

- The right subtree [m+1..r] can be a right child of m. So right_child[m+1][r] must be True.

Similarly, for right_child[l][r] (subtree is a right child of l-1):

Choose a root m in [l..r] such that:

- GCD(a[m], a[l-1]) >1.

- The left subtree [l..m-1] can be a left child of m (left_child[l][m-1] is True).

- The right subtree [m+1..r] can be a right child of m (right_child[m+1][r] is True).

If any such m exists for the interval, then left_child[l][r] or right_child[l][r] is True.

Once we have filled these DP tables, the answer is whether there exists a root m such that:

- The left subtree [0..m-1] is a left child of m (left_child[0][m-1] is True) OR there is no left subtree (m=0).

Wait, no. For the root m of the entire tree, the left subtree is [0..m-1]. Since the root has no parent, the left subtree must be a left child of m. However, the left_child[l][r] for the left subtree [0..m-1] would require that the parent is r+1, which is m. So left_child[0][m-1] must be True. Similarly, the right subtree [m+1..n-1] must be a right child of m, which requires right_child[m+1][n-1] must be True.

But if m has no left subtree (m=0), then left_child[0][m-1] is not applicable. Similarly, if m has no right subtree (m = n-1), then right_child[m+1][n-1] is not applicable.

So for the root m of the entire tree:

- If m has a left child (i.e., m > 0), then left_child[0][m-1] must be True.

- If m has a right child (i.e., m < n-1), then right_child[m+1][n-1] must be True.

So, the answer is Yes if there exists an m in 0..n-1 such that:

- left_child[0][m-1] is True (if m > 0).

- right_child[m+1][n-1] is True (if m < n-1).

And, when there's no left subtree (m=0), we don't need to check left_child. Similarly for no right subtree.

So putting this all together:

We precompute a GCD table for all pairs (i, j) to check if GCD(a[i], a[j])>1.

Then, we build the left_child and right_child tables using dynamic programming.

For the DP:

- For intervals of length 1 (l == r):

   left_child[l][r] is possible if r+1 is a valid index and GCD(a[r], a[r+1])>1.

   right_child[l][r] is possible if l-1 is a valid index and GCD(a[l], a[l-1])>1.

But wait, no. Because for left_child[l][r], the subtree is a left child of r+1. So the root is the single node l (since l == r), and the parent is at r+1. So GCD(a[l], a[r+1]) must be >1.

Similarly, for right_child[l][r], the subtree is a right child of l-1. So the root is l, and GCD(a[l], a[l-1]) must be >1.

But for the case where the interval is l=r, and we're considering left_child or right_child, the parent must exist (r+1 must be <=n-1 for left_child, or l-1 >=0 for right_child). Otherwise, the subtree cannot be a left or right child of a parent that doesn't exist.

So for the base case:

left_child[l][r] (where l == r) is True if r+1 <n and GCD(a[l], a[r+1])>1.

right_child[l][r] is True if l-1 >=0 and GCD(a[l], a[l-1])>1.

For intervals longer than 1:

For left_child[l][r], we iterate all possible m in l..r:

   if GCD(a[m], a[r+1]) >1 (and r+1 exists), then check if left_child[l][m-1] (left subtree is a left child of m) and right_child[m+1][r] (right subtree is a right child of m) are True. If for any m, this holds, left_child[l][r] is True.

Similarly, for right_child[l][r], iterate m in l..r:

   if GCD(a[m], a[l-1]) >1 (and l-1 exists), then check if left_child[l][m-1] and right_child[m+1][r] are True. If any m satisfies this, right_child[l][r] is True.

Now, the order in which we process the intervals is important. Since the DP for larger intervals depends on smaller intervals, we need to process them in increasing order of interval length.

So the steps for the code would be:

1. Read n and the sorted array a.

2. Precompute a GCD table for all pairs (i, j) to check if GCD(a[i], a[j])>1.

   But since n is up to 700, this would be a 700x700 table, which is manageable.

3. Initialize left_child and right_child as 2D arrays of size n x n, filled with False.

4. Fill the base cases (length 1 intervals):

   For each i from 0 to n-1:

      if i+1 <n, check GCD(a[i], a[i+1])>1. If yes, left_child[i][i] = True.

      if i-1 >=0, check GCD(a[i], a[i-1])>1. If yes, right_child[i][i] = True.

5. For intervals of length 2 up to n:

   For each possible l and r where r = l + len -1 (len starts from 2 up to n):

      For left_child[l][r]:

         if r+1 >=n: cannot be a left child of r+1 (since r+1 is out of bounds). So left_child[l][r] remains False.

         else:

             iterate m from l to r:

                 if GCD(a[m], a[r+1])>1:

                     check if left_child[l][m-1] (if m > l) or True (if m == l) and right_child[m+1][r] (if m < r) or True (if m == r).

                     So:

                     left_valid = (m == l) or left_child[l][m-1]

                     right_valid = (m == r) or right_child[m+1][r]

                     if left_valid and right_valid:

                         left_child[l][r] = True

                         break (no need to check other m)

      Similarly for right_child[l][r]:

         if l-1 <0: cannot be a right child of l-1. So remains False.

         else:

             iterate m from l to r:

                 if GCD(a[m], a[l-1])>1:

                     left_valid = (m == l) or left_child[l][m-1]

                     right_valid = (m == r) or right_child[m+1][r]

                     if left_valid and right_valid:

                         right_child[l][r] = True

                         break

6. Once the DP tables are filled, check for the entire interval [0..n-1] (the root has no parent):

   For each possible root m in 0..n-1:

       left_ok = True

       if m >0:

           left_ok = left_child[0][m-1] 

       right_ok = True

       if m <n-1:

           right_ok = right_child[m+1][n-1]

       if left_ok and right_ok:

           return "Yes"

   If any m satisfies this, output "Yes", else "No".

Now, considering the constraints. n is up to 700. The DP tables are O(n^2) each (left_child and right_child). For each interval [l..r], which is O(n^2) intervals, we iterate up to O(n) possible m's. So total time complexity is O(n^3) which is 700^3 = 343 million operations. But Python is somewhat slow for such operations. Hmm. 343 million operations would take more than a second. But perhaps with optimizations, like precomputing GCDs and using memoization, and breaking early when a valid m is found, it might pass.

Wait, but 343 million operations in Python is way over the 1e8 operations per second. So that's a problem. So we need to find a way to optimize this.

But let's think. For each interval [l..r], when checking possible m's, once we find a valid m, we can break the loop and mark the interval as True. So for each interval, the inner loop runs until a valid m is found, which may take O(1) steps if the first m is valid, or O(n) steps in the worst case.

In practice, perhaps this can be manageable with some optimizations.

But to optimize, perhaps precompute all possible GCDs between all pairs. But even that is O(n^2) which for n=700 is 490,000. That's manageable.

Another optimization: precompute a matrix gcd_matrix where gcd_matrix[i][j] is 1 or 0 indicating whether GCD(a[i], a[j]) >1.

Then, during the DP steps, checking GCD is O(1).

So let's proceed.

Now, implement this step by step.

First, read the input:

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then, precompute the gcd_matrix:

gcd_matrix = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if math.gcd(a[i], a[j]) > 1:
            gcd_matrix[i][j] = True
        else:
            gcd_matrix[i][j] = False

But this is O(n^2), which is acceptable.

Then, initialize left and right DP tables.

left_child = [[False]*(n) for _ in range(n)]
right_child = [[False]*(n) for _ in range(n)]

Fill the base case for intervals of length 1:

for i in range(n):
    # left_child[i][i]: can be a left child of i+1
    if i+1 <n:
        left_child[i][i] = gcd_matrix[i][i+1]
    else:
        left_child[i][i] = False
    # right_child[i][i]: can be a right child of i-1
    if i-1 >=0:
        right_child[i][i] = gcd_matrix[i][i-1]
    else:
        right_child[i][i] = False

Then, for intervals of length >=2:

for length in range(2, n+1):
    for l in range(n):
        r = l + length -1
        if r >=n:
            continue
        # Compute left_child[l][r]
        if r+1 <n:
            # possible to be left child of r+1
            for m in range(l, r+1):
                if not gcd_matrix[m][r+1]:
                    continue
                # check left and right subtrees
                left_valid = True
                if m > l:
                    left_valid = left_child[l][m-1]
                right_valid = True
                if m < r:
                    right_valid = right_child[m+1][r]
                if left_valid and right_valid:
                    left_child[l][r] = True
                    break
        # Compute right_child[l][r]
        if l-1 >=0:
            # possible to be right child of l-1
            for m in range(l, r+1):
                if not gcd_matrix[m][l-1]:
                    continue
                left_valid = True
                if m > l:
                    left_valid = left_child[l][m-1]
                right_valid = True
                if m < r:
                    right_valid = right_child[m+1][r]
                if left_valid and right_valid:
                    right_child[l][r] = True
                    break

Wait, but in the code above, for each interval length, l starts from 0 and r is l+length-1. However, for some l, r may exceed n-1, so we need to skip those.

Now, after filling the DP tables, check for the entire tree:

for m in range(n):
    left_ok = True
    if m >0:
        if not left_child[0][m-1]:
            left_ok = False
    right_ok = True
    if m <n-1:
        if not right_child[m+1][n-1]:
            right_ok = False
    if left_ok and right_ok:
        print("Yes")
        exit()
print("No")

This is the code.

But let's test it against the examples.

First example:

Input:
6
3 6 9 18 36 108

Let's see for m=2 (a[2] =9). Then left subtree is 0..1 (3,6). left_child[0][1] must be True. And right subtree is 3..5 (18,36,108). right_child[3][5] must be True.

But according to the example, the answer is yes.

Another example:

Input:
2
7 17

Check for m=0: left subtree is empty, right subtree is 1. right_child[1][1] must be True. right_child[1][1] is True only if 1-1 >=0 (i.e., 0 is the parent) and GCD(17,7) >1. But 17 and7 have GCD 1, so right_child[1][1] is False. So for m=0, right_ok is False.

For m=1: left subtree is 0. left_child[0][0] must be True. left_child[0][0] is True only if 0+1 <2 and GCD(7, 6) (wait, a[0+1] is 17. So left_child[0][0] is whether a[0] (7) and a[0+1] (17) have GCD>1. 7 and 17 GCD is 1. So left_child[0][0] is False. So left_ok is False. So overall output is No.

Third example:

Input:
9
4 8 10 12 15 18 33 44 81

The answer is Yes.

Now, possible m is somewhere in the middle. For example, m=4 (a[4]=15). Then left subtree is 0..3, which must be left_child[0][3], and right subtree is 5..8, which must be right_child[5][8].

But how this is computed depends on the DP steps.

But the code should handle it.

Now, about the time constraints. For n=700, the code would run O(n^3) operations, which is 700^3 = 343 million. But Python can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second, so this would take 3.43e8 / 1e8 = ~3.43 seconds, which is over the 1-second time limit.

So this approach may not be feasible for n=700. So we need to find a way to optimize.

Alternative idea: memoize the possible m for each interval and direction.

Alternatively, precompute for each interval [l..r] and direction (left or right) the possible roots m.

But I'm not sure.

Another observation: in the DP transitions, when checking for a valid m, for left_child[l][r], we can check m in a specific order. For example, for the left_child, the parent is at r+1, and the root m must have a GCD>1 with a[r+1]. So perhaps we can precompute for each r+1 the list of possible m in [l..r] that have GCD with a[r+1] >1.

But again, this may not save enough time.

Alternative idea: in the DP loops, for each interval [l..r], when checking m for left_child[l][r], we can break early once we find a valid m, which may save some time. For example, if the first m in the loop satisfies the conditions, we can skip the rest.

But the worst case is still O(n^3), but with some practical optimizations, it might pass.

Alternatively, we can reverse the order of m in the loop. For example, for left_child[l][r], the parent is r+1, which is to the right. So perhaps the root m is the last element in the interval (r) because it's the closest to the parent. So checking m starting from r down to l may find a valid m quickly.

This is a heuristic and may vary per case, but could lead to speedups.

So modifying the code for left_child[l][r] loops m from r downto l:

for left_child[l][r], iterate m from r downto l:

   if GCD(a[m], a[r+1])>1:

       check left and right sub-intervals.

       if valid, set left_child[l][r] to True and break.

Similarly for right_child[l][r], iterate m from l to r.

But why? Because for left_child[l][r], the parent is r+1, which is to the right. So choosing the root m as close to r as possible might be better, as the left and right subtrees may be smaller. Or maybe not. This is just a heuristic.

Alternatively, for left_child, the root m must have a GCD>1 with a[r+1]. So precompute for each r+1, the list of m in [l..r] where this is true. Then, during the DP, for left_child[l][r], we only iterate over those m's.

This could save time, but requires precomputing for each r+1, which is O(n^2) storage. For example, for each j (r+1), store a list of m's in each interval [l..r] (where r+1 = j).

But this is not feasible.

Alternatively, during the DP step for left_child[l][r], we can loop m from l to r, and check if gcd_matrix[m][r+1] is True. So, for each interval [l..r], and for each m in [l..r], check if m can connect to r+1.

But this doesn't save any steps.

So, given the time constraints, perhaps the code is not feasible for Python with n=700.

But perhaps with certain optimizations, like using bitsets or early termination, it can pass.

Another possible optimization is to note that when building the left_child and right_child tables, for a given interval [l..r], the left_child depends on the left_child and right_child of smaller intervals, so processing the intervals in order of increasing length is correct.

But how to optimize the innermost loops.

Alternatively, precompute for each possible m, the list of intervals where m is the root.

But I'm not sure.

Another observation: the left_child and right_child tables can be filled using memoization. But in Python, recursion is too slow, so iterative approach is better.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code is acceptable, but in practice, for n=700, it may be too slow.

An alternative approach is to realize that the root of the entire tree must be such that the left and right subtrees can be connected to it. So, for the entire tree, the root must have left_child[0][m-1] and right_child[m+1][n-1] True. But perhaps the root is a node that has many common divisors. So, precompute for each node m, whether there exists a left subtree and right subtree that can connect to it.

This is what the code does. But the code checks all possible roots m, and for each, checks the left and right subtrees.

But again, the DP steps are O(n^3), which is a problem.

Another idea: the problem is similar to the problem of validating a Cartesian tree. But the condition here is different.

Alternatively, use memoization with l and r and parent direction.

But I don't see a way to reduce the time complexity.

In the given problem's constraints, n is up to 700, and the time limit is 1 second. For Python, O(n^3) is likely to be too slow. So we need a better approach.

Alternative approach:

For each node, precompute the possible left and right children, then build the tree recursively.

But this seems similar to the DP approach.

Another idea: the problem can be viewed as a tree structure where each node's children must have a GCD>1 with it. The tree must be a BST with the given in-order traversal.

So the problem reduces to finding a way to split the array into a root, left and right subtrees, such that all parent-child edges have GCD>1.

This is similar to the problem of building a binary tree with certain properties. The DP approach is standard for such problems.

But with the given time constraints, perhaps we can find a way to optimize the DP.

Wait, but in the current DP approach, for each interval [l..r], we are checking all possible m. But for a given interval and direction (left or right), the choice of m is constrained by the GCD with the parent (r+1 or l-1).

So for left_child[l][r], the parent is r+1, and the root m must have GCD(a[m], a[r+1])>1.

So during the loop over m in [l..r], we can precompute the possible m's for each r+1. For example, for each j (r+1), we can have a list of m's where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1. This way, for left_child[l][r], we can iterate only those m's in [l..r] that are in the list for j=r+1.

This reduces the number of m's we need to check for each interval.

For example, if a[j] is even, then all even m's in [l..r] are possible. So for each j, we can precompute the list of indices m where GCD(a[m], a[j])>1.

Precomputing this for all j can help.

Yes! This is a crucial optimization.

Precompute for each j, the list of indices m where GCD(a[m], a[j])>1.

Then, for left_child[l][r], which requires j = r+1, we can iterate only the m's in the list for j that are within [l..r].

Similarly for right_child[l][r], which requires j = l-1.

This way, the number of m's we check for each interval can be reduced.

For example, if j has a small number of compatible m's, this reduces the inner loop's iterations.

This can significantly reduce the number of operations, especially when there are many j's with few compatible m's.

So let's implement this optimization.

First, precompute for each j, a list of m's where GCD(a[m], a[j])>1.

compatible_left = [[] for _ in range(n)]  # j's compatible m's for left_child (parent is j)
compatible_right = [[] for _ in range(n)] # j's compatible m's for right_child (parent is j)

Wait, no. For left_child, the parent is j=r+1, so for left_child[l][r], the parent is j=r+1. So for each j, compatible_left[j] is the list of m's where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1.

Similarly, for right_child, the parent is j=l-1, so for each j, compatible_right[j] is the list of m's where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1.

But for the code, it's the same as compatible_left and compatible_right are the same data. Because compatible_left[j] is list of m's where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1. So for both left_child and right_child, the compatible m's are the same. So we can precompute for each j, a list of m's where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1.

So precompute for each j, a list of m's where GCD(a[m], a[j})>1. This is O(n^2) in time and space.

Then, for left_child[l][r], the parent is j = r+1. So for left_child[l][r], we need to check m in compatible[j] that are within [l..r].

Similarly, for right_child[l][r], the parent is j = l-1. So check m in compatible[j] that are within [l..r].

This way, instead of iterating all m in [l..r], we only iterate those m's that have GCD>1 with the parent.

This can significantly reduce the number of m's considered in the inner loops.

So let's proceed.

Precompute:

compatible = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for j in range(n):
    for m in range(n):
        if gcd_matrix[m][j]:
            compatible[j].append(m)

Then, for left_child[l][r], parent j = r+1:

if j >=n: continue.

Else, iterate m in compatible[j] that are between l and r inclusive.

But how to efficiently get the m's in compatible[j] that are in [l..r].

We can pre-sort each compatible[j] list, and then use binary search to find the range.

Yes! Because compatible[j] is a list of indices m where a[m] and a[j] have GCD>1. If we sort compatible[j], then for a given interval [l..r], we can use binary search to find the start and end indices in compatible[j] that fall within [l..r].

For example, using the bisect module in Python.

So, for each j, compatible[j] is sorted in increasing order.

Then, for left_child[l][r], j = r+1. If j >=n: continue.

Else, find in compatible[j] all m where l <= m <=r.

We can use bisect_left to find the first m >= l, and bisect_right to find the first m >r. The slice is the m's in compatible[j][left..right-1].

Iterate these m's in reverse order (from larger to smaller) or forward order, depending on which might find a valid m quicker.

This can drastically reduce the number of m's considered for each interval.

For example, if compatible[j] is empty for j=r+1, then left_child[l][r] is False without any iteration.

This optimization can make the code feasible for n=700.

So, the steps now are:

1. Precompute compatible[j] for each j, sorted in increasing order.

2. For each interval [l..r] in increasing order of length:

   a. Compute left_child[l][r]:

      j = r+1

      if j >=n: continue.

      Using bisect, find all m in compatible[j] that are in [l..r].

      Iterate these m's (in reverse order, hoping to find a valid m quickly).

      For each m in this list:

          check if left_child[l][m-1] and right_child[m+1][r] are True.

          if yes, set left_child[l][r] to True and break.

   b. Compute right_child[l][r]:

      j = l-1

      if j <0: continue.

      Using bisect, find all m in compatible[j] that are in [l..r].

      Iterate these m's (perhaps in reverse order).

      For each m:

          check if left_child[l][m-1] and right_child[m+1][r] are True.

          if yes, set right_child[l][r] to True and break.

This optimization can reduce the number of iterations in the inner loops.

Now, let's implement this.

First, precompute the compatible lists and sort them:

import bisect

compatible = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for j in range(n):
    for m in range(n):
        if gcd_matrix[m][j]:
            compatible[j].append(m)
    # sort the list
    compatible[j].sort()

Then, in the DP loops:

For left_child[l][r]:

j = r +1

if j >=n: continue.

We need to iterate m in compatible[j] that are >=l and <=r.

Use bisect to find the left and right positions:

left_pos = bisect.bisect_left(compatible[j], l)

right_pos = bisect.bisect_right(compatible[j], r)

m_candidates = compatible[j][left_pos:right_pos]

Iterate m_candidates in reverse order (to try larger m first), since for left_child, the parent is j = r+1, which is to the right. Perhaps choosing m closer to r may allow for smaller intervals.

Similarly for right_child, iterate m_candidates in reverse order.

So, for left_child[l][r]:

for m in reversed(m_candidates):

    check if left_child[l][m-1] and right_child[m+1][r] are True.

    if so, set left_child[l][r] to True and break.

Similarly for right_child.

This should reduce the number of iterations.

This way, the code's time complexity is still O(n^3) in the worst case, but with a much better constant factor.

With this optimization, the code should pass for n=700.

Now, integrating this into the code.

So the code becomes:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys
import math
import bisect


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline())
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))

    gcd_matrix = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if math.gcd(a[i], a[j]) >1:
                gcd_matrix[i][j] = True
            else:
                gcd_matrix[i][j] = False

    # Precompute compatible lists
    compatible = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for j in range(n):
        for m in range(n):
            if gcd_matrix[m][j]:
                compatible[j].append(m)
        compatible[j].sort()

    left_child = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        # left_child[i][i] can be True if j = i+1 is valid and compatible
        j = i +1
        if j < n and i in compatible[j]:

Another example:

2
7 17

compatible[1] (j=1, 17) has m's where a[m] and 17 have GCD>1. But since 7 and 17 are coprime, compatible[1] is empty. So for m=0, the right_child[1][1] is False. So output is No.

Third example:

9
4 8 10 12 15 18 33 44 81

The code should find a valid root m.

Thus, this approach should work.
