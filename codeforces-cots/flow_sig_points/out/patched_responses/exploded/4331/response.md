<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit tricky. Let's break it down.

So, we have m = n * k staves. We need to make n barrels, each with k staves. The volume of each barrel is the minimum stave in it. The sum of these volumes needs to be as large as possible, but with the condition that the maximum difference between any two volumes is at most l. If it's impossible to meet this condition, we output 0.

First, I need to find a way to group the staves such that all the volumes (the minima of each barrel) are within l of each other. And among all possible such groupings, choose the one with the maximum total sum.

Let's think about the key constraints here. The volumes of all barrels must differ by at most l. So, the maximum possible minimum in any barrel minus the minimum possible minimum should be <= l. Wait, no. The problem states that for any two barrels, the absolute difference between their volumes must be <= l. So the maximum volume minus the minimum volume across all barrels must be <= l. Because if that's the case, then any pair will automatically satisfy the condition. So, all the volumes must lie within a range of l.

So, how to maximize the sum of the volumes? We need all the volumes to be as high as possible. But they must lie within a range of l. So the optimal scenario is that all volumes are in some interval [x, x + l], where x is as large as possible. But since all volumes are in this range, the maximum possible sum is x * n if all are x, but perhaps we can have some higher ones up to x + l, but that's not possible because the maximum minus the minimum must be <= l. Wait, but if we have some in x and some in x + l, then the maximum difference would be exactly l, which is allowed. However, the sum would be maximized if as many as possible of the volumes are as high as possible.

So, the approach might be to sort the staves, then find a window of possible minima that can form the required volumes, with the maximum and minimum in that window differing by <= l. Then select the highest possible window and compute the sum accordingly.

Wait, but the volumes are determined by the minimum of each barrel's staves. So, for each barrel, we need to choose k staves, and the minimum of those is the volume. So, the volume of a barrel is the minimum of the k staves selected for it. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we want each volume to be as large as possible. But all volumes must lie within a range of l.

Hmm. Let's consider sorting all the staves in non-decreasing order. Then, perhaps the best approach is to select the largest possible possible minima that can form n barrels, with the maximum and minimum of these n minima differing by at most l.

So, let's sort the array a in ascending order. Then, for each possible position i where a[i] could be the smallest volume (the minimum of the group), we need to check if there's a group of n elements (the minima of each barrel) such that each is between a[i] and a[i] + l. Then, select the largest possible a[i] such that this is possible.

But how to model this? Let's think. Let's say we have the staves sorted. Then, the minimal volume of a barrel is the minimum of the k staves in it. So, to maximize the sum, we need the volumes to be as large as possible, but all within l of each other.

So, the plan is:

1. Sort the array a in non-decreasing order.

2. Find the largest possible x such that there are at least n staves >= x, and the maximum of these x's (the largest x) minus the minimum (x itself) is <= l. Then, the sum would be the sum of the first n staves in this group, but that's not necessarily correct. Wait, no. Because the minimal staves chosen as the volumes could be spread out. Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to select the largest possible group of n staves where the largest among them is <= the smallest plus l, and then use each of these as the volume of a barrel. Then, arrange the remaining staves in such a way that each barrel has k staves.

Wait, but the volume of a barrel is the minimum of its k staves. So, each volume must be the minimum of its own barrel. So, if we choose n staves (each being the minimum of their respective barrels), then those n staves must be such that the maximum among them minus the minimum is <= l. And the rest of the staves (n*k - n) must be assigned to the barrels such that they are not the minimum of any barrel. That is, each of the n selected staves must be the minimum of their barrel, and each of the other staves must be part of a barrel that has a minimum <= to their own value.

So, the steps could be:

- Sort the array in ascending order.

- Find the maximum possible position i such that a[i + n -1] - a[i] <= l. Because in this case, the n staves from a[i] to a[i + n -1] can be the minima of the barrels, each contributing to the sum, and their maximum difference is a[i + n-1] - a[i] <= l.

Wait, but there are more constraints here. Because each of those n staves (the minima of the barrels) must be part of a barrel of k staves. So, for each of these n staves (say, at positions i, i+1, ..., i+n-1), we need to have enough staves after them (including themselves) to form their barrel. For example, the first selected minimum (a[i]) must have at least k staves >= a[i] (since it's the minimum of its barrel). Wait, no. Because the barrel for a[i] must consist of k staves, including a[i], which is the minimum. So the other staves in the barrel can be any staves, as long as they are >= a[i]. So, to assign each of these n minima to their own barrels, we need to have enough staves to the right (higher or equal) of each of them.

But perhaps a better way to think is that after selecting the n minima (each as the minimum of their barrel), each of them must have at least (k-1) staves that are >= themselves. But these staves can't be used for other barrels' minima. Wait, but the other staves (those not selected as minima) can be part of any barrel as long as their barrel's minimum is <= them.

So the problem reduces to:

After sorting the array, select n positions (the minima) such that:

1. The maximum of these n positions' values - minimum <= l.

2. For each of the n positions, there are at least (k-1) staves to the right (including those selected as minima in other positions) that can be used to form their barrels.

But how to ensure that? Let's think in terms of the sorted array.

Once we have sorted the array, the first step is to find the largest possible x such that there's a group of n elements in the sorted array where each element is >= x, the maximum element in this group is <= x + l, and there are enough elements in the array to form the n*k staves into barrels with these minima.

But how?

Alternatively, the approach is to find the rightmost possible group of n elements (the minima) such that their maximum and minimum differ by <= l, and there are enough staves after each of these elements to form their barrels.

Wait, here's an idea. The sorted array is a_0, a_1, ..., a_{m-1} (m = n*k). Let's find the largest possible group of n elements (indices i_0 <= i_1 <= ... <= i_{n-1}) such that a[i_{n-1}] - a[i_0] <= l. For this group to be valid, we need that for each element a[i_j], there are at least (k-1) elements >= a[i_j] (including a[i_j] itself) that can be allocated to the barrel. But how?

Wait, perhaps this can be modeled as follows. Once the sorted array is arranged, the minimal possible group of n minima (to maximize the sum) is the largest possible such group. Let's find the rightmost possible index i where a[i + n - 1] - a[i] <= l, and check if there are enough elements to form the barrels.

Wait, but the group must consist of exactly n elements (the minima of the barrels). So, the minimal element in this group is a[i], and the maximal is a[i + n - 1], which must be <= a[i] + l.

But also, each of these n elements must be able to form a barrel by selecting k-1 elements from the remaining staves (not part of the minima group) or from the other minima (but wait, no, because those minima are part of other barrels).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of an example.

Take the first sample input:

4 2 1

Staves: [2,2,1,2,3,2,2,3] sorted becomes [1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3]. The minima are 1,2,2,3. The volumes are 1, 2, 2, 3. Max difference is 2 (3-1=2, but l is 1 here). Wait wait, the sample input's output is 7, and the note says that the volumes are 1,2,2,2. Wait, perhaps the sample explanation's staves are sorted as [1,2,2,2,2,3,3,2], but I need to look back. Wait, the input is 2 2 1 2 3 2 2 3. When sorted, it's 1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3? Wait, let's see:

Original input array: 2,2,1,2,3,2,2,3. After sorting: 1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3. So the sorted array is [1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3]. Then the possible group of n=4 minima could be starting at position 0: 1,2,2,2 (but their max is 2, 2-1=1 <= l=1). But in the sample explanation, the minima are 1,2,2,2. So sum is 7. But how to arrange the barrels.

Each barrel must have k=2 staves. The first barrel has 1 as the minimum. So it takes 1 and another stave >=1. The second takes 2 as minimum, and another stave >=2, etc.

But how do we ensure that there are enough staves to allocate to each barrel.

So, the approach here is to select n minima (each from the sorted array) such that their max - min <= l. Then, arrange the remaining staves into these barrels in such a way that each barrel has exactly k staves, and the selected minimum is the minimal in each barrel.

To do this, perhaps the earliest possible minima are selected. For example, in the first sample, the minima are 1,2,2,2. Each of these must have at least k-1 staves after them (since the remaining staves in the barrel can be any of the staves >= the minimum). But how?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:

After sorting the array, find the largest possible index i such that a[i + n -1] - a[i] <= l, and there are at least (n * k) - (i + n) +1 staves remaining. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

Suppose we select the first n minima as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. Then, the maximum difference between any two is a[n-1] - a[0]. If this is <= l, then the sum is the sum of these n elements. But perhaps we can find a group of n elements further to the right (higher values) that still satisfies the max difference <= l, thus giving a higher sum.

So the idea is to find the rightmost possible group of n elements where the maximum in the group minus the minimum <= l. Then, the sum of the elements in this group will be the maximum possible. However, this is only possible if we can form the barrels with those minima.

But how to check if it's possible to form the barrels?

Let me think. Once we have such a group, each element in the group is the minimum of a barrel. Each barrel must have exactly k staves. So, for each element in the group (the minima), we need to have at least (k-1) staves >= it. These staves can be from anywhere else in the array, but once assigned to a barrel, they can't be used for others.

But how to model the availability of staves?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to:

Once we select the n minima (the group) in the sorted array, the total number of staves required is n*k. The selected group's elements are the minima. For each of these elements, we need to have enough staves in the array (including those in the group) that are >= a[i] (the minimum of the barrel) to form the k-1 other staves.

But how to calculate this.

Wait, the sorted array is in non-decreasing order. So, for each a[i], all staves from i to the end are >= a[i].

So, the minimal way to assign staves is as follows:

For the first barrel (minimum a[i_0]), we need to take a[i_0], and k-1 staves from the remaining staves (those not selected as minima). But the remaining staves after the minima group may not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to select the n minima from the sorted array such that the earliest possible minima are as large as possible.

Wait, perhaps the solution is:

Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Find the largest possible index i such that a[i + n - 1] - a[i] <= l. Then, check if the remaining staves (i + n to m-1) plus the staves in the group (excluding those selected as minima) are sufficient to assign k-1 staves to each of the n barrels.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the total number of staves in the array after position i (including those in the group) is >= n * k.

Wait, no. Because the group is i to i + n -1. Then, all staves after i are >= a[i]. So, for each of the n barrels (with minima a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i + n - 1]), we need to have enough staves >= their minimum to form the k staves.

But the staves can be arranged in a way that each barrel's staves are selected from the earliest possible positions to maximize the number of available staves for the next barrels.

For example, the first barrel (with minimum a[i]) needs k-1 staves >= a[i]. The earliest possible is to take the next (k-1) staves after the minima group. But perhaps we can model this as follows:

After the group of n minima (positions i to i + n -1), the remaining staves (positions i + n to end) are all >= a[i]. Then, the total number of staves available to assign to the barrels is (m - (i +n)) + (n * k - n) (since the group has n elements, and each barrel needs k staves, so total needed is n*k. The group has n staves, so the remaining needed is n*k - n = n(k-1)).

Wait, the remaining staves (from position i +n to the end) are (m - (i +n)) staves. Then, the total available staves (excluding the n minima) is (m -n) staves (since we have m = n*k, which is n*k -n = n(k-1) staves). But the available staves must be >= a[i], so all staves from i onwards are >= a[i]. So, the available staves are (m - i) staves (including the group). But the group's n elements are the minima, so the remaining staves after the group are (m - (i +n)).

So, the total staves available for the barrels' other k-1 staves is (m - (i +n)) + (n * (k -1)).

Wait, no. The staves in the group (i to i +n-1) are the minima of the barrels. Each of these n barrels must have k-1 staves from the staves that are >= their minimum. So, for each barrel j (with minimum a[i+j]), the k-1 staves can be any staves >= a[i+j]. But since the array is sorted, these staves can be from the right side.

But how to model the required number of staves.

Alternatively, here's a way to model it:

Once the group is chosen (positions i to i +n-1), the first barrel (minimum a[i]) requires k-1 staves >= a[i]. The next barrel (a[i+1]) requires k-1 staves >= a[i+1], and so on.

But since the array is sorted, all staves from position i onwards are >= a[i]. However, the staves from i+1 onwards are >= a[i+1], which is >= a[i]. So, perhaps the optimal way to assign staves is to assign the earliest possible staves to the earliest barrels. For example:

The first barrel (minimum a[i]) can take the next (k-1) staves from the end of the group. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of the sample.

Sample 1:

Sorted array: [1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3]. n=4, k=2.

Suppose the group is from index 0 (1, 2, 2, 2). Wait, but the maximum in this group is 2, so 2-1=1, which is <= l=1. So this group is valid. Then, each barrel needs 2 staves. The first barrel (min 1) can take staves from the rest (staves 0 is the min, and needs 1 more stave. The remaining staves are from index 1 to 7. So assign stave 1 to this barrel, making it [1,2]. The second barrel (min 2) takes staves 2 and 3. Wait, no. Because each barrel's min is part of the group. So the group is indices 0,1,2,3. Then, each of these must be the min of their barrels. The first barrel (min 1) can take stave 0 and 7 (as long as 1 is the min). So, the other stave can be any >=1. The second barrel (min 2) can take stave 1 and another >=2. Then, the sum of the minima is 1+2+2+2=7.

But how to ensure that there are enough staves to assign for each barrel.

Another approach is to model the problem as follows:

After choosing the group of n minima (i to i+n-1), the total number of staves available to assign to the barrels (excluding the n minima) is m - n. Each barrel needs (k-1) staves. So, the total required is n*(k-1) = m - n. Which is exactly the available staves, so as long as the group is valid (max - min <= l), the assignment is possible.

Wait, because m =n*k. So, m -n =n*(k-1). So the required staves for the (k-1) per barrel is exactly the available. So, perhaps the only condition is that the group of n minima is such that a[i +n -1] -a[i] <= l.

But wait, in sample 4, the input is 3 2 1. Staves: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. n=3, k=2. So m=6. The group of n=3 minima would need to be a consecutive group where a[i+2] -a[i] <=1. Let's see:

Possible groups:

i=0: 1,2,3 → 3-1=2>1 → invalid.

i=1: 2,3,4 → 4-2=2>1 → invalid.

i=2: 3,4,5 → 5-3=2>1.

i=3: 4,5,6 →6-4=2>1. So no group possible. Hence output is 0.

Which matches the sample.

But how?

So, the key is that when a group of n minima exists where the max in the group minus the min is <= l, then the assignment is possible. Because there are exactly (n*k -n) =n(k-1) staves left, which is exactly the required number of (k-1) per barrel. And since the array is sorted, each of the remaining staves is >= a[i], which is the minimum of their respective barrels. Wait, but the other staves are assigned to the barrels. For example, a barrel whose minima is a[i] can take any (k-1) staves from the remaining ones (including those in the group, but that's not possible since those are minima of other barrels. Oh right, the group consists of exactly n minima, each being the minimum of a barrel. So the other staves in the group (those not in the minima) are part of other barrels as minima. So, no, they can't be used as staves in other barrels. Therefore, the remaining staves are those not in the group (the group is the n minima), which are m-n staves, which is exactly the required n*(k-1). So, the only condition is that the group of n consecutive elements (since the array is sorted) has max - min <= l. Then, the assignment is possible.

Wait, but why consecutive? For example, what if the group is not consecutive? Like, in the first sample, could we pick a group of minima as [1,2,3,3] (indices 0,1,6,7) but the max is 3, min is 1, difference is 2>1. So it's invalid.

But in the sorted array, the group must be consecutive. Because to have the maximum possible sum, the group must be as far to the right as possible. But the group must be consecutive to minimize the max - min difference.

Ah, right. Because if we select a group that is not consecutive, the max - min would be larger than or equal to the consecutive group. So, the optimal way is to select a consecutive group of n elements in the sorted array, such that their max - min is <= l, and then select the rightmost such group.

So the algorithm is:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Check if the last n elements (the largest possible) have max - min <= l. If yes, sum them.

3. Otherwise, find the rightmost possible group of n consecutive elements where max - min <= l.

4. If no such group exists, output 0.

5. Otherwise, sum the elements of the group.

But wait, no. Because the group needs to have exactly n elements, and when you take a group starting at i, the elements are a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+n-1]. The max in this group is a[i+n-1], min is a[i]. So the difference is a[i+n-1] - a[i]. If this <= l, then the group is valid.

So, the steps would be:

- Sort the array.

- For each i from 0 to m -n, check if a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l. The largest possible i for which this is true would give the maximum sum (since the elements are sorted, a[i] is as large as possible).

But how to find the largest possible i?

We can iterate from the end (i starts from m-n down to 0) and find the first i where a[i +n -1] -a[i] <= l. Once found, compute the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+n-1]. If no such i is found, output 0.

But wait, in the sample input 3:

Input:

1 2 1

5 2

After sorting: [2,5]. n=1, k=2. So the group is of size 1. The elements are a[i], and i can be 0 or 1? Wait, m =n*k=2. So n=1, so the group is size 1. So possible i is 0 and 1.

Check for i=1: the group is a[1] (5). The max and min are 5, 5. Difference is 0 <= l=1. So valid. So sum is 5. But the sample output is 2.

Wait, this contradicts. So what's wrong here?

Wait sample input 3 is:

1 2 1

5 2 → sorted as [2,5].

n=1, k=2, l=1. The output is 2.

Ah, because when you form one barrel, you need to take two staves. The minimal stave is the volume. So the possible options are:

Barrel can be [5,2] → min is 2. Or [2,5] → min 2. So the volume is 2. So the sum is 2.

But according to the algorithm above, the group is the rightmost possible i. i can be 1 (the group is [5]). Then sum is 5, but how to form the barrel. Because the group is the minima. So the barrel must have 5 as the minimum, but the other stave (2) is less than 5. Which is not allowed. So the algorithm's logic is incorrect.

Ah, this shows that the previous reasoning is flawed. So the approach of just selecting a group of n minima and assuming that the remaining staves can be allocated is not correct. Because in this case, the group is [5], but there's only one other stave (2) which is less than 5. So the barrel would have to consist of 5 and 2, but then the min is 2, not 5. So this group is invalid.

So the algorithm's logic must be wrong.

So the group selection must also ensure that for each of the selected minima, there are enough staves >= them to form the k-1 other staves in the barrel.

So, the key is that after selecting the group of n minima (each being the minimum of a barrel), the total number of staves >= a[i] (the minimum of the entire group) must be >= n*k. Because all the selected minima are >= a[i], and each barrel's staves must be >= their own minimum. So the minimal possible requirement is that there are at least (k-1) staves >= each selected minimum, but that's complicated to check.

Alternatively, since the array is sorted, the rightmost possible group (i as large as possible) would have a[i] as the minimum of the group, and a[i +n-1] <= a[i] + l.

But in order for each barrel to have k staves, each selected minimum (from the group) must have at least (k-1) staves that are >= it (including those in the group). Wait, but the group itself contains the selected minima. For example, if the selected group is a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+n-1], then each a[i+j] (j from 0 to n-1) is the minimum of their respective barrels. So each barrel for a[i+j] must have (k-1) staves that are >= a[i+j]. Since the array is sorted, all staves from i+j onwards are >= a[i+j]. So for each a[i+j], the number of staves >= a[i+j] is (m - (i + j)). So, for each a[i+j], (m - (i +j)) >= (k-1 +1) → m - (i+j) >=k → i +j <= m -k. Because each barrel needs k staves, the minimum's own position is part of the k staves, so (k-1) more.

Wait, but for each selected minimum a[i+j], the total number of available staves >= a[i+j] is (m - (i +j)), since the array is sorted. So for each a[i+j], we need (m - (i +j)) >= k. Because the barrel for a[i+j] must have k staves, including a[i+j]. So the other k-1 staves must be >= a[i+j], and they can be selected from the staves starting at i+j.

So for each a[i+j], the number of available staves (including a[i+j]) is m - (i +j). This must be >=k.

But since the array is sorted, the earliest possible i+j for the group is i (for j=0) and the latest is i +n-1 (for j=n-1). So, the most restrictive condition is for j =n-1. Because i +n-1 + (k-1) <= m-1. So:

i +n-1 + (k-1) <= m-1 → i +n +k-2 <= m-1 → i <= m -n -k +1.

But m =n*k. So:

i <= n*k -n -k +1 = n(k-1) -k +1. Which is a bit unclear. Maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, for each selected minimum in the group (positions i to i+n-1), the position i+j must satisfy (m - (i+j)) >=k. So:

i+j +k <= m → i+j <= m -k.

But j ranges from 0 to n-1, so the maximum j is n-1. So, for j =n-1, i +n-1 <= m -k → i <= m -k -n +1.

But m =n*k. So:

i <= n*k -k -n +1 = (n-1)(k-1) +1 -1? Not sure.

But in sample input 3, the selected group is i=0. Then j can be 0. So m - (i+j) =2 -0 =2 >=k=2. So that's okay. But for j=0, the staves available are 2 and 5. But in the sample, the barrel must consist of 2 and5, and the minimum is 2. So the group is [2], and the sum is 2. Which is correct.

But according to the previous approach, the group would be i=1 (a[1] =5), but then m - (i+j) = 2 -1+0 =1 <k=2. So that's invalid.

So the condition is that for each selected minimum in the group, the position i+j must satisfy (m - (i+j)) >=k.

Which for each j in 0..n-1, i+j <= m -k → i <= m -k -j.

But to ensure this for all j, the worst case is j= n-1. So i must be <= m -k -(n-1) → i <= m -k -n +1.

But m =n*k. So:

i <= n*k -k -n +1 → i <= (n-1)(k-1) +1 -n +1 ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute for sample input3:

n=1, k=2, m=2.

i <= m -k - (n-1) → 2-2 -0 =0. So i can be 0.

Which is correct. So for i=0, j can be 0. The condition is m - (0+0) >=2 → 2 >=2. Which is true.

So, the group is [2], and the sum is 2, which is correct.

So the steps need to be:

Find the largest i such that:

1. a[i +n -1] -a[i] <= l.

2. For all j in 0..n-1, i +j <= m -k → i <= m -k -j.

But since j can be up to n-1, this becomes i <= m -k - (n-1) → i <= m -k -n +1.

So combining these two conditions: i must be as large as possible such that a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l and i <= m -k -n +1.

Wait, but how to find such i.

So the approach is:

Sort the array.

Compute m =n*k.

Then, for i in 0..(m -n - (k-1)), check if a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l. And i can be up to m -k -n +1.

Wait, m -k -n +1 =n*k -k -n +1 =k(n-1) -n +1. Not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum possible i is m -k - (n-1) → i <= (m -k) - (n-1) → i <= m -k -n +1.

So, the possible i's are from 0 to m -k -n +1.

For example, in sample input3, m=2, n=1, k=2. m -k -n +1 =2-2-1+1=0. So i can be 0.

In sample input1:

m=8, n=4, k=2. m-k -n +1 =8-2-4+1=3. So i can be up to 3.

So the group would be i=3. Check a[3+3] -a[3] =a[6]-a[3] =3-2=1 <= l=1. So valid.

But for each j in 0..3 (since n=4), check i +j <= m -k → 3+ j <=8-2=6. For j=3, 3+3=6 <=6. Valid.

So the group i=3, which gives the minima 2,2,3,3 (sum 10). But sample output is 7. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait sample input1's correct group is i=0 (a[0] =1, a[3] =2, 2-1=1 <=l=1). But according to the new condition, i can be up to 3.

So the algorithm would select i=3 as the largest possible i where the group is valid.

But the sum would be a[3] +a[4] +a[5] +a[6] =2+2+2+3=9. But sample output is 7.

So this is incorrect.

So the approach is wrong. What's the problem here?

Ah, because in sample input1, the group i=3 gives the minima [2,2,2,3]. The max is 3, min is 2 → difference 1 <=l=1. But when creating the barrels, each must have k=2 staves. For the first barrel (min 2, from a[3]), the available staves >=2 are positions 3 to7. So there are 5 staves (including a[3]). The barrel for a[3] (min 2) can take a[3] and a[4]. Then the next barrel (min 2) takes a[5] and a[6]. Then the third barrel (min 2) takes a[7]. But wait, no. Because each barrel needs 2 staves.

Wait, the group is [a[3], a[4], a[5], a[6]] → 2,2,2,3. But m=8, n=4, k=2. So the group has 4 elements (the minima), and there are 8-4=4 other staves. Each barrel needs 2 staves, so 4 *1 =4. So the other staves are from positions 0,1,2,7 (since the group is 3-6). The staves not in the group are 0,1,2,7. Which are 1,2,2,3.

But the first barrel (min 2) needs to have k=2 staves. So the barrel can consist of a[3] (the min) and another stave >=2. But the other staves not in the group (positions 0,1,2,7) are 1,2,2,3.

So the first barrel can take a[3] (2) and a[0] (1) → but then the min is 1, which is not part of the group. So this is invalid. Hence, the approach of selecting the group is invalid.

So the previous approach's condition is insufficient. We need to not only have the group's max - min <= l, but also ensure that for each of the group's elements, there are enough staves to form their barrels.

But how to compute this.

Let me think again. The group of n minima must be chosen such that:

1. The max in the group minus the min <= l.

2. For each of the n minima (positions i, i+1, ..., i+n-1), the number of staves >= a[i_j] (including a[i_j] itself) must be at least k. Because each barrel requires k staves, and the minimum is a[i_j], so all staves in the barrel must be >= a[i_j].

But since the array is sorted, the staves >= a[i_j] are from position i_j onwards.

So for each i_j in the group, the number of staves from i_j to m-1 (inclusive) must be >=k.

So for each i_j in the group, (m - i_j) >=k → i_j <= m -k.

So the earliest possible position for i_j is i_j <= m -k.

But the group is positions i to i +n-1. So for the last element in the group (i +n-1), we need i +n-1 <= m -k → i <= m -k -n +1.

So the maximum possible i is m -k -n +1. So the group must start at i <= this value.

Ah! So the group must start at i <= m -k -n +1. Otherwise, even if the group's max - min is <= l, there's not enough staves for the barrels.

So the correct approach is:

Sort the array.

Compute m =n*k.

Find the largest possible i (starting from the largest possible) where:

- i <= m -k -n +1 (so that i +n-1 <= m -k).

- a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

If such i exists, sum the elements from a[i] to a[i+n-1].

Else, output 0.

So in sample input1:

m=8, n=4, k=2.

m -k -n +1 =8 -2 -4 +1=3.

So i can be up to 3.

Check for i=3:

i+n-1=3+3=6. a[6] -a[3] =3-2=1 <= l=1 → valid.

So the group is a[3],a[4],a[5],a[6]. Sum is 2+2+2+3=9. But the sample's correct answer is 7.

This suggests that this approach is incorrect. So where's the mistake?

In the sample input1, according to this approach, the group would be selected as i=3, but when forming the barrels, the other staves may not be sufficient.

Wait, for each of the group's elements (i_j =3,4,5,6):

For i_j=3: m -i_j=8-3=5 >=k=2 → ok.

For i_j=4: 8-4=4 >=2 → ok.

For i_j=5: 8-5=3 >=2 → ok.

For i_j=6:8-6=2 >=2 → ok.

So all are valid.

But in this case, how to assign the staves.

The group is 3,4,5,6 (staves 2,2,2,3).

The remaining staves are 0,1,2,7 (1,2,2,3).

Each barrel (four barrels) need to have 2 staves, with their minima as 2,2,2,3.

Barrel 1: min 2 (a[3]). Need to take one more stave >=2. Available are positions 4,5,6,7, but wait, those are part of the group. Or the remaining staves are 0,1,2,7.

Wait, no. The group's staves are 3,4,5,6. The remaining staves are 0,1,2,7. Those are the ones not in the group.

So each barrel in the group must take their min and k-1 other staves >= their min.

For the first barrel (min a[3]=2):

We need to take one more stave >=2. The available staves are 4,5,6 (from the group), 7 (from remaining). But the group's staves (3,4,5,6) are already allocated as minima. So the other staves in the group cannot be used in other barrels' minima, but can they be used as part of other barrels' staves?

No. Because the group's staves are the minima of their own barrels. So each group's stave is part of a barrel as the minimum. So the other staves in the group can't be used in other barrels, except as their own minima.

Wait, no. For example, if a group's stave is at position 3 (value 2), it is the minimum of its own barrel. The other staves in the group (positions4,5,6) are minima of other barrels. So, the other staves in the group are already assigned as minima of their own barrels and cannot be part of other barrels. So the available staves for the first barrel (min 2) are the remaining staves (0,1,2,7) and the other staves not in the group.

Wait, no. The group consists of four minima. Each of these minima must be part of their own barrels. The other staves (non-group) can be assigned to any barrel as long as they are >= the barrel's min.

So for the first barrel (min 2, position3), we need to select one more stave >=2. The available staves are:

- Those in the group: positions4,5,6 are minima of other barrels, so they cannot be used here. So the other staves are positions0,1,2,7. So, from these, which are >=2? positions1,2,7 (values 2,2,3). So three staves available.

So for the first barrel (min2), take position3 (min) and one of positions1,2,7.

Second barrel (min2, position4): must take position4 (min) and one of positions1,2,7 (remaining). But after taking one from these, there are two left.

Third barrel (min2, position5): take position5 (min) and one of the remaining.

Fourth barrel (min3, position6): take position6 (min) and position7 (3), but position7 is already used in the first barrel? If we use it there.

This is getting complicated. The key point is whether there are enough staves >= each group's minima to form the barrels.

But according to the previous condition, since for each group's minima i_j, m -i_j >=k, there are sufficient staves in the array to form the barrel. So why is the sample's correct answer different?

In the sample input1:

Group is i=3, minima are 2,2,2,3. Sum is 9. But sample's correct sum is7.

This suggests that the algorithm's approach is incorrect.

But according to the sample explanation, the selected minima are 1,2,2,2. Sum 7.

So why is that the case?

Because when the group is i=0 (min1), the group's max is a[3] =2, which is 1 <= l=1. So the group is valid. Then, for each of the minima:

- For a[0] (1): m -0 =8 >=k=2. So can take 1 more stave >=1. Which is possible.

- For a[1] (2): m -1=7 >=2.

- For a[2] (2): m -2=6 >=2.

- For a[3] (2): m -3=5 >=2.

So this group is valid.

But why is the previous group (i=3) not valid?

Because when we select i=3, the group is 2,2,2,3. The other staves are 1,2,2,3. But for the fourth barrel (min3 at position6), the available staves >=3 are positions6 and7. So the barrel would need to take 3 and another >=3. There's only position7 (3) available. So the fourth barrel would consist of 3 and3. The other barrels:

Barrel1 (min2 at3): take 2 and 2 (from positions3 and4) → but wait, position4 is part of the group (minima of another barrel), so can't be used here. Or can it?

Ah, here's the crux of the problem. The group's staves are the minima of their own barrels. But other staves in the group can be used as part of other barrels' staves.

For example, the group is positions3,4,5,6 (values 2,2,2,3). The other staves are positions0,1,2,7 (1,2,2,3).

Barrel for position3 (min2) can use any staves >=2, including those in the group (4,5,6). But those are already the minima of their own barrels. So they cannot be used as part of other barrels' staves.

Because each stave can be part of exactly one barrel.

So the group's staves (3,4,5,6) are each used as the minima of their own barrels. The other staves (0,1,2,7) are to be assigned to the barrels as part of their k-1 staves.

So for the first barrel (position3, min2), we need to choose one more stave >=2 from the other staves. The other staves are 0 (1), 1 (2), 2 (2),7 (3). So the possible choices are 1,2,7. So take one of them.

Then, for the second barrel (position4, min2), choose one from the remaining (if any). But after assigning one to the first barrel, there may not be enough.

For example, if the first barrel takes 3 (min2) and 1 (2), then the second barrel needs to take 4 (min2) and another >=2. But the remaining staves are 0 (1), 2 (2), 7 (3). So 2 is available. Then third barrel (5,2) can take 5 and 7. Fourth barrel (6,3) needs two staves >=3. But only 6 and7 are available. But 7 is already used in third barrel. So this would be impossible.

Hence, the group i=3 is invalid because there are not enough staves to assign to the barrels.

So the algorithm's previous conditions are insufficient. We need to also check that after selecting the group, there are enough staves in the non-group part to fill the barrels.

So the problem is more complex.

So, how to model this.

The group of n minima is selected. The remaining staves are m -n =n*(k-1).

Each of the barrels needs to have k-1 staves from the remaining staves. But these staves must be >= the respective minima.

But since the array is sorted, the remaining staves are from positions0 to i-1 and i+n to m-1.

But the group is from i to i+n-1. The remaining staves are those before i and those after i+n-1.

But the staves before i are <= a[i], and the staves after i+n-1 are >=a[i+n-1].

But each barrel's minimum is >=a[i]. So the staves before i are <= a[i], which is less than the minima of the barrels. So they cannot be used in any of the barrels. Hence, the only available staves are those after i+n-1 (from i+n to m-1), which are >=a[i+n-1] >= a[i].

So the available staves for the barrels are the ones after the group (i+n to m-1), which have count = m - (i+n).

But we need to assign n*(k-1) staves (since each barrel has k-1 staves besides the minimum).

But m - (i+n) must be >=n*(k-1).

So the condition is:

m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But m =n*k, so:

n*k -i -n >=n*(k-1).

n*k -i -n >=n*k -n.

Subtracting n*k from both sides:

-i -n >=-n → -i >=0 → i <=0.

Which is only possible when i=0. But this is not the case in many samples.

So this suggests that the available staves after the group are insufficient except when i=0.

But this is not correct. For example, in sample input1, when i=0, the group is positions0-3 (1,2,2,2). The available staves after the group are positions4-7 (2,2,3,3), which are 4 staves. n*(k-1) =4*(2-1)=4. So available staves are exactly 4. So they can be assigned.

In this case, the barrels can be formed by taking each minima in the group and assigning the available staves from the end.

For example:

Barrel 0 (min1) takes 1 and 2 (from position4).

Barrel1 (min2) takes 2 and2 (position5).

Barrel2 (min2) takes 2 and3 (position6).

Barrel3 (min2) takes 2 and3 (position7). 

But wait, no. Because the available staves after the group are positions4-7 (values2,2,3,3). So each barrel's k-1 staves are taken from these.

For the first barrel (min1), we need to take k-1=1 stave >=1. Which can be any of the available staves. But the available staves are after the group (i+n=4), which are 4 staves. These are assigned as follows:

The first barrel (min1) takes 1 (from group) and 2 (from available).

The second barrel (min2) takes 2 (from group) and 2.

Third barrel (min2) takes 2 and 3.

Fourth barrel (min2) takes 2 and3.

But this uses all available staves.

But in this case, the group is i=0, and the available staves after the group are 4. Which equals n*(k-1) =4*1=4. So it works.

But for group i=3:

available staves after the group (i+n =3+4=7) are positions7 (3). So m - (i+n) =8 -7=1. n*(k-1) =4*1=4. 1<4, so it's impossible.

So the condition is:

m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But since m =n*k, this simplifies to:

n*k -i -n >=n*(k-1) → n*k -i -n >=n*k -n → -i >=0 → i <=0.

So this condition can only be true when i=0.

But in sample input1, i=0 is valid. And that's the case used in the sample.

So the correct condition for selecting the group is:

a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

and

m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But m =n*k.

So the second condition is:

n*k -i -n >=n*k -n → i <=0.

Which is only possible when i=0.

But this can't be right. Because in the sample input2:

Input:

2 1 0

10 10.

m=2, n=2, k=1.

The group is i=0 and i=1. For each barrel, k=1. So each barrel is just the selected minima.

For i=0:

group is [10,10], max - min=0 <=0. And m - (0+2) =0 >=0. So condition holds.

Sum is 20.

But according to the condition m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1):

n*(k-1) =2*0=0. m - (0+2) =0 >=0. So yes.

So group is i=0. Sum 20.

Which is correct.

But for i=1:

group is [10], n=2? No, group must be n elements. So in this case, n=2, so group is positions i=0 and1. But for k=1, each barrel is just the minima.

So, this shows that when k=1, the group must be of n elements, and the other condition is satisfied.

So the general approach is:

The group must be such that:

1. a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

2. m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But m =n*k. So substituting:

n*k - i -n >=n*(k-1) → n*k -i -n >=n*k -n → -i >=0 →i <=0.

Thus, the only possible i is 0.

But this is not the case for other examples.

Wait, this can't be. For example, sample input3:

n=1, k=2, m=2.

Condition 2: m - (i +1) >=1*(2-1) →2 -i -1 >=1 →1 -i >=1 →i <=0.

So i can be 0. Which is correct.

But sample input4: n=3, k=2, m=6.

Condition for i=0: m - (0+3) >=3*(2-1) →6-3=3 >=3 →3>=3 →yes.

Group is a[0], a[1], a[2]. max is a[2]-a[0}=3-1=2>1. So no.

So the conditions must be both checked.

So the correct approach is:

Sort the array.

For each i from 0 up to (m -n) where the group of n elements starting at i is valid (a[i+n-1] -a[i] <=l) and (m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1)), find the largest possible i. The sum is the sum of the elements from i to i+n-1.

But according to the condition m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1), which simplifies to i <=0, the only possible i is 0.

But this is not true for sample input1. Because in sample input1, when i=0:

m - (0+4) =8-4=4. n*(k-1) =4*(2-1)=4. 4 >=4 → yes.

So i=0 is valid.

When i=3:

m - (3+4)=8-7=1. 4*(1)=4. 1 <4 → invalid.

So the only valid i is 0.

Thus, the group is i=0.

So the algorithm is:

Sort the array.

Iterate over all possible i where:

1. a[i +n-1] - a[i] <= l.

2. m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

The largest possible i is the maximum i that satisfies both conditions.

So, to find the maximum possible i, we can iterate i from 0 to (m -n), but only consider those i where m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1), and a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

The largest such i is the best.

So the steps are:

- Sort the array.

- Check if the first n elements (i=0) have a[i +n-1] -a[0] <=l. And m -n >=n*(k-1). If yes, then i=0 is valid.

- If not, check other i's where m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1). But since m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1) → i <= (m -n) -n*(k-1) → i <= m -n -n*(k-1) → i <= m -n*(k) → i <=0. So the only possible i is 0.

So, the only possible i is 0.

But this seems conflicting with sample input3.

Sample input3:

n=1, k=2, m=2.

i can be 0 and 1.

But the condition m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1) → m -(i+1) >=1*1 →2 -i -1 >=1 →1 -i >=1 →i <=0.

So i=0 is the only possible.

So, the group is i=0. a[0+1-1] -a[0] =a[0] -a[0] =0 <=1. So sum is a[0] =2. Which is correct.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to check i=0 and possibly other i's where m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But according to the condition, the only possible i is 0.

So the algorithm is:

Sort the array.

Check if i=0 is valid (a[n-1] -a[0] <=l and m -n >=n*(k-1)).

If yes, sum the first n elements.

Else, check other i's where m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1).

But m - (i +n) >=n*(k-1) → i <= (m -n) -n*(k-1) → i <= m -n -n(k-1) → m =n*k → i <=n*k -n -n(k-1) → i <=n*k -n -n*k +n →i <=0.

So only i=0 is possible.

So, the algorithm is:

Sort the array.

If a[n-1] -a[0] <=l and m -n >=n*(k-1) → which is always true since m -n =n*k -n =n(k-1) → so m -n >=n(k-1) → equality.

So the condition is always true for i=0 if a[n-1] -a[0] <=l.

So the algorithm is:

Sort the array.

If the first n elements (after sorting) have a[n-1] -a[0] <=l → then sum them.

Else, output 0.

But this is not correct in the sample input1.

Sample input1's group is i=0, which has a[3] -a[0] =2-1=1 <=l=1. So sum is 1+2+2+2=7, which is correct.

So the correct algorithm is:

Sort the array.

Check if a[n-1] -a[0] <=l. If yes, sum the first n elements. Else, output 0.

But why does this work?

Because when we select the first n elements as minima, the remaining staves are m -n =n(k-1). Each of these staves is >=a[0], since the array is sorted. So each barrel's minima is in the first n elements, and the remaining staves are all >=a[0]. So each barrel's minima (which is >=a[0]) can take any of the remaining staves (which are >=a[0] and thus >= the minima).

Thus, the algorithm is:

Sort the array.

If the first n elements have max - min <=l, then sum them.

Else, output 0.

But this contradicts the first sample's other group (i=3) which would have sum 9.

But why is that group invalid?

Because in that case, the remaining staves after the group (i=3) are not sufficient to fill the barrels' required k-1 staves. For example, for the group i=3, the remaining staves are 8-3-4=1 stave (position7). Which is less than the required 4*1=4. So the group is invalid.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to select the first n elements in the sorted array. If their max - min <=l, then sum them. Else, output 0.

But why?

Because for the first n elements to be valid, they must be such that the remaining staves (m-n) can be allocated to the barrels as the k-1 staves. Since the array is sorted, the remaining staves are all >=a[0]. Each barrel's minima (a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]) is >=a[0], so all remaining staves are >= the minima. Thus, each barrel can take any of the remaining staves, as long as the total is sufficient.

The total remaining staves is m-n =n*(k-1), which is exactly what is needed. So, the assignment is possible.

For example, in sample input3, the first n=1 element is 2. The remaining staves are 5. But the barrel requires k=2 staves, so take 2 and5. The min is 2, sum is 2.

So the algorithm works.

But wait, in sample input1, the first n=4 elements are 1,2,2,2. The remaining staves are 4,5,6,7 (indices4-7), which are 2,2,3,3. Each barrel (4 barrels) needs 1 more stave.

These remaining staves are assigned to the barrels in reverse order to maximize the available staves.

For example:

Barrel4 (min2) takes 2 and3.

Barrel3 (min2) takes 2 and3.

Barrel2 (min2) takes 2 and2.

Barrel1 (min1) takes 1 and2.

But the staves are assigned in such a way that the largest remaining staves are used first for the last barrels. This way, each barrel has enough staves.

Thus, the algorithm is correct.

So the steps are:

Sort the array.

Check if the first n elements have max - min <= l.

If yes, sum those n elements.

Else, output 0.

But why does this work for all cases?

Because:

- The remaining staves are exactly n*(k-1), which is needed.

- All remaining staves are >= a[0], which is <= a[i] for all i in the group (since the group is sorted). Thus, each barrel's minima (a[i]) is >= a[0], and the remaining staves are >=a[0], so >= the minima.

Thus, each barrel can take any remaining staves.

But how to ensure that each barrel's minima is the minimal stave in its barrel.

For example, if a barrel's minima is a[i], then the other staves in the barrel must be >= a[i]. Since the remaining staves are >= a[0], but a[i] could be larger than a[0], but the remaining staves could be < a[i]. For example, a[i] is 3, and the remaining staves include 2. Then the barrel's stave would be 3 and 2, and the minima would be 2, not 3. Which is invalid.

But this is not possible because the array is sorted. So the remaining staves are >= a[0], but since the group is the first n elements, the remaining staves are after the group. For example, the first n elements are a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. The remaining staves are a[n], a[n+1], ..., a[m-1]. All of which are >= a[n-1], because the array is sorted.

But wait, no. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[m-1].

So the first n elements are the smallest n elements. The remaining staves are larger or equal.

So the remaining staves (after the first n elements) are >= a[n-1], which is the maximum of the group.

So for any barrel with minimum a[i] (which is part of the first n elements, a[i] <= a[n-1]), the remaining staves are >= a[n-1] >= a[i]. So they are all >= a[i].

Thus, when we assign the remaining staves to the barrels, each barrel's minima is a[i], and the other staves in the barrel are >= a[i].

Thus, the algorithm is correct.

So the correct solution is:

Sort the array.

Check if the difference between the first n elements' max and min is <= l.

If yes, sum the first n elements.

Else, output 0.

So this explains the sample input3: the first n=1 element is 2. The remaining stave is 5, which is >=2. So the barrel is [2,5], sum is2.

Sample input1: first 4 elements are 1,2,2,2. difference is 1 <=1. sum is 7.

Sample input4: first3 elements are1,2,3. difference 3-1=2>1. output 0.

Thus, the correct algorithm is to sum the first n elements if their max - min <= l.

This seems counterintuitive, but it works.

So the implementation steps are:

Read n, k, l.

Read the array, sort it.

Check if the first n elements' max (a[n-1]) - min (a[0]) <=l.

If yes, sum the first n elements.

Else, output 0.

But wait, what about the case where there's a group of n elements somewhere else in the array with max - min <=l and a higher sum?

For example, consider:

n=2, k=2, l=1.

Staves: [1,2,3,4]. sorted.

The first 2 elements are 1 and2. Their max - min is1 <=1. Sum is3.

But there's another group [2,3] with sum5. max - min is1.

But according to the algorithm, we would take the first group. Sum 3. But the optimal sum is5.

So why is this not handled by the algorithm?

Because according to the algorithm, the group must be the first n elements. But in this case, the group [2,3] is not the first two elements. So the algorithm would not consider it.

But according to the problem's conditions, the group [2,3] is valid (max - min=1 <=l=1), and the remaining staves are 4-2=2 staves (1,4). But the required staves are n*(k-1)=2*(2-1)=2. So the available staves are 2, which is sufficient. But according to the algorithm, this group is not considered.

Thus, the algorithm is incorrect.

But according to the problem's conditions, the group [2,3] would have sum 5. But according to the algorithm, the group is not selected. So this is a problem.

So why is this?

Because the algorithm's approach is incorrect.

So the problem is that the algorithm's logic is incorrect, and the correct approach requires considering groups other than the first n elements.

But how to model this correctly.

This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, and that the correct approach must involve finding the largest possible group of n elements in the sorted array such that:

1. The group's max - min <= l.

2. The group's elements are followed by at least (k-1)*n staves.

Because the remaining staves after the group must be allocated to the barrels.

So, the algorithm should find the largest possible i such that:

a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

and

(m - (i +n)) >= (k-1)*n.

Because the remaining staves after the group must be at least (k-1)*n to fill each barrel's k-1 staves.

But in this new example, m=4, n=2, k=2, l=1.

The group i=1 has a[1+2-1] =a[2] =3. a[2] -a[1] =3-2=1 <=1. And m -(i +n) =4 - (1+2)=1. (k-1)*n=2. 1<2. So this group is invalid.

But the group i=0:

a[1] -a[0] =2-1=1 <=1.

m - (0+2) =4-2=2 >=2. So valid.

Sum is1+2=3.

But there's another group i=2: a[2], a[3]. a[3]-a[2]=4-3=1 <=1. m - (2+2)=0 >=2? No. So invalid.

So the algorithm would select i=0, sum3.

But there's no other valid group.

But the other example I mentioned:

Staves [1,3,4,5], n=2, k=2, l=2.

Sorted as [1,3,4,5].

The first group is i=0. max -min=3-1=2 <=l=2. sum1+3=4.

Another group is i=1: a[2] -a[1] =4-3=1 <=2. remaining staves are 5- (1+2) =2. (k-1)*n=2. So 2 >=2. Valid. Sum3+4=7.

So according to this, the algorithm would select i=1, sum7, which is better.

But according to the previous algorithm, it would select i=0.

So this shows that the algorithm must consider other groups.

Thus, the correct approach is to find the largest possible i where:

a[i +n-1] -a[i] <=l.

and

m - (i +n) >= (k-1)*n.

Then, select the group with the largest possible i that satisfies both conditions.

The sum would be the sum of a[i] to a[i +n-1].

If no such i exists, output 0.

Thus, the correct algorithm must iterate over possible i's and check these two conditions.

So how to implement this.

Sort the array.

For each i from 0 to m-n:

if a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l and (m - (i +n) ) >= (k-1)*n:

record this i.

The largest such i is the best.

Once i is found, sum the group.

So in the example with staves [1,3,4,5], n=2, k=2, l=2.

m=4.

For i=0:

a[1] -a[0] =3-1=2 <=2.

m - (0+2) =4-2=2 >= (2-1)*2=2 → yes.

For i=1:

a[3] -a[1] =5-3=2 <=2.

m - (1+2) =4-3=1 >=2 → no.

For i=2: group is a[2], a[3]. 5-4=1 <=2. m -4=0 >=2 → no.

So only i=0 is valid. sum 4.

But what about the example I mentioned earlier where there's a group with higher sum but the conditions are met.

Let me create such an example.

Example:

n=2, k=2, l=1.

Staves: [1,2,3,4]. sorted.

We want to select i=1: group is [2,3]. max - min=1 <=1.

remaining staves after group: m - (i+n) =4 - (1+2) =1. (k-1)*n=2*1=2. 1<2 → invalid.

So cannot select.

Another example:

n=2, k=3, l=1.

Staves: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. sorted.

m=6.

We need to select groups of n=2 elements.

For i=0: group is [1,2]. max - min=1 <=1.

remaining staves:6 -0-2 =4. (k-1)*n=2*2=4. 4 >=4 → yes.

Sum is 1+2=3.

For i=1: group is [2,3]. max - min=1 <=1.

remaining staves:6 -3=3 >=4? No. 3<4 → invalid.

For i=2: group [3,4]. remaining staves:6-4=2 <4 → invalid.

So i=0 is the only valid.

Sum is3.

But if we could select i=2, sum 3+4=7, but it's not possible.

So the algorithm works.

Another example:

n=2, k=3, l=1.

Staves: [2,3,4,5,6,7]. m=6.

Group i=0: [2,3]. remaining staves 4 staves. sum5.

Group i=1: [3,4]. remaining staves 3. (3 >= (3-1)*2=4 → no.

No valid.

Sum5.

Another example:

n=3, k=2, l=2.

m=6.

Staves: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. sorted.

We want to select a group of 3 elements with max -min <=2.

 possible groups:

i=0: [1,2,3], max 3-1=2 <=2. remaining staves 3. (k-1)*n=3*1=3. 6-0-3=3 >=3 → yes. sum6.

i=1: [2,3,4]. max 4-2=2 <=2. remaining staves 6-1-3=2. 2 <3 → invalid.

i=2: [3,4,5]. 5-3=2. remaining 6-2-3=1<3 → invalid.

i=3: [4,5,6]. 6-4=2. remaining 6-3-3=0 >=3 → no.

Thus, only i=0 is valid. sum6.

But group i=0 is the first three elements.

Thus, the algorithm works.

So, to implement this:

We need to iterate i from 0 to m-n.

For each i, check:

1. a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l.

2. (m - (i +n)) >= (k-1)*n.

If both conditions are met, track the maximum i.

Once the maximum i is found, sum the elements from i to i+n-1.

If no such i exists, output 0.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that m can be up to 1e5.

Iterating from i=0 to m-n is O(m), which is acceptable.

Sorting is O(m log m), which is acceptable.

So the steps are:

Read n, k, l.

Read the array, sort.

Compute m =n*k.

Initialize max_sum =0.

Iterate i from 0 to m-n:

 if a[i+n-1] -a[i] > l: skip.

 if (m - (i +n)) < (k-1)*n: skip.

 else: compute sum of a[i..i+n-1], track the maximum i (since array is sorted, the sum is maximized for the largest possible i).

Thus, the code should iterate from i=0 to m-n, and for each i, check the two conditions, and track the largest i that satisfies both.

The sum of the largest i's group will be the maximum possible.

Thus, the code:

Sort the array.

Find the largest i in 0 ≤ i ≤ m-n, such that:

a[i +n-1] -a[i] <= l.

and

(m - (i +n)) >= (k-1)*n.

If such i exists, sum a[i..i+n-1].

Else, output 0.

So in code:

Read n, k, l.

a = list of m =n*k integers.

sort a.

m = len(a)

max_i = -1

for i in range(m - n +1):

    if a[i +n-1] -a[i] > l:

        continue

    available = m - (i +n)

    needed = (k-1)*n

    if available >= needed:

        if i > max_i:

            max_i = i

if max_i ==-1:

    print(0)

else:

    sum_vol = sum(a[max_i : max_i +n])

    print(sum_vol)

But wait, in the example where i=0 is valid and another i is larger and also valid, the code will pick the largest i, which gives the highest sum.

For example, in the example where i=0 and i=1 are both valid. The largest i is selected.

So this code should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, k, l = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    a.sort()
    m = len(a)
    max_i = -1
    required = (k - 1) * n
    for i in range(m - n + 1):
        if a[i + n - 1] - a[i] > l:
            continue
        available = m - (i + n)
        if available >= required:
            max_i = i
    if max_i == -1:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
    else:
        total = sum(a[max_i : max_i + n])
        print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

10 10
""",
            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Another example:

n=2, k=2, l=1.

Staves: [1,2,3,4].

m=4.

i=0:

a[1]-a[0]=1 <=1.

available=4-0-2=2 >= (2-1)*2=2 → yes. sum1+2=3.

i=1:

a[2]-a[1]=3-2=1 <=1.

available=4-1-2=1 >=2 → no.

i=2:

a[3]-a[2]=4-3=1 <=1.

available=4-2-2=0 >=2 → no.

So sum is3.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.

Thus, the correct code is as described.

        max_i = i
if max_i == -1:
