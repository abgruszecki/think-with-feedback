<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of triplets of cards that form a set. Let me read the problem carefully again.

So, each card has k features, each of which is S, E, or T. A set is three cards where for each feature, all three are the same or all different. So, for each feature, the three cards must either all have the same value, or each have a unique value. 

The input gives n cards (up to 1500), which is a lot. The naive approach of checking all possible triplets would be O(n^3), which for n=1500 would be about 3.3 billion operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle maybe 1e8 operations per second. So we need a smarter approach.

Hmm, how can I optimize this? Let's think about how to represent the features and check for possible triplets.

First, let's think about for a given pair of cards, what the third card must look like to form a valid set. Because if we can compute that quickly, we can check if that third card exists in our set.

For each feature, the third card's value is determined by the first two. Let's see:

If the two cards have the same value for a feature, the third must also have the same. If they are different, the third must be the remaining possible value. Because, for example, if two are S and E, then the third must be T to have all different.

So for each feature, given two values a and b, the third value c is uniquely determined. So for the entire k features, given two cards, there's exactly one possible third card that would form a set with them. Then, if this third card exists in our list of cards, this triplet is a valid set.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate through all pairs of cards (O(n^2) time).
2. For each pair, compute the required third card.
3. Check if that third card exists in our collection.
4. Sum the number of such valid triplets, then divide by 3 (since each triplet is counted three times: once for each pair in the triplet).

Wait, why divide by 3? Because for a triplet (A,B,C), each of the three pairs (A,B), (A,C), (B,C) would generate the third card. For example, pair (A,B) generates C, pair (A,C) generates B, pair (B,C) generates A. So each triplet is counted three times. So to get the correct total, we need to count all occurrences and then divide by 3.

So the steps would be:

- Precompute a set (or a hash map) of all cards for O(1) lookups.
- For each pair of cards (i,j), compute the required third card c.
- If c is in the set and the index of c is greater than j (to avoid counting duplicates?), wait no. Because when considering all pairs (i,j) where i < j, then the third card c must be in the set, and c can be either before i, between i and j, or after j. But that approach would require checking if c exists in the set, regardless of position.

But how to avoid overcounting? Let's think:

Suppose we have triplet (A,B,C). The pair (A,B) will generate C. The pair (A,C) will generate B. The pair (B,C) will generate A. All three pairs will find the third card. But when we iterate over all possible pairs (i,j) where i < j, then (A,B) is considered once, (A,C) once (if C is after A), and (B,C) once (if C is after B). Wait, but if the pairs are considered in any order (like all possible ordered pairs), then the count would be 3 per triplet. So if we iterate through all possible ordered pairs (including all permutations), then each triplet is counted exactly 3 times. But if the code iterates through all combinations (i,j) where i < j, then each triplet is counted once for each pair (i,j) where i and j are part of the triplet and i < j. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Wait, the approach of considering all ordered pairs (i,j) where i != j and then counting how many times the third card exists would count each triplet exactly three times. Because for a triplet (A,B,C), the three pairs (A,B), (A,C), (B,C) would each generate the third card. So the total count would be the number of valid triplets multiplied by 3. So, the correct answer would be (total count) / 3.

But if we consider all possible pairs (including i and j in any order), but the third card is uniquely determined. For example, in triplet (A,B,C), when you process pair (A,B), you compute C. If C exists, then you count 1. Then, pair (A,C) would compute B, which exists, so count another 1. Pair (B,C) computes A, which exists, count another 1. So in total, this triplet contributes 3 to the count. Then, when you sum all pairs and divide by 3, you get the correct answer.

Therefore, the algorithm is:

Initialize a set S of all cards.

Initialize a counter to 0.

For each i from 0 to n-1:

   For each j from i+1 to n-1:

       compute the required third card c for the pair (i,j).

       if c is in S and c is not card i or j (but since all cards are distinct, this is automatically handled?), and c comes after j, then increment the counter by 1.

Wait, no. Because in the pair (i,j), the third card could be any card in the list except i and j. But the list may have the third card in any position. So the approach where for each pair (i,j), compute c and check if it's present in the set (and is a different card) will count all possible triplets where the third card is in the set.

But the problem is that when you process the pair (i,j), and c exists, but c is already in the set but is not part of the triplet (i,j,c) in the list. Wait, no: because if the third card exists, then the triplet (i,j,c) is a valid set. However, the third card may not be after j in the list. But in that case, when you process other pairs, like (i,c) if i < c, then j would be the third card. Hmm.

Alternatively, the approach of iterating over all pairs (i,j) where i < j, and then checking if the third card c exists in the set, and c is different from both. Then, for each such triplet, how many times is it counted?

Take a triplet (i,j,c) where i < j < c. Then when processing (i,j), c is computed. If c exists, then the count increases by 1. Also, when processing (i,c), the required third card would be j. But j is before c, so when i < j < c, (i,c) is a pair, and the third card j is before i? No, in this case, i < j < c. So (i,c) is a pair where i < c. The third card for (i,c) would be a card that, when combined with i and c, forms a set. But in this case, the third card would have to be j only if for each feature, the three cards i, c, j form a valid set. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, for the triplet (i,j,c) to form a set, each feature must be either all same or all different. So when considering pair (i,j), the third card c is determined as the required one. Similarly, when considering pair (i,c), the third card is determined, but it's j only if the features of i, c, j meet the condition. So in this scenario, the triplet (i,j,c) is considered once when we process (i,j) and compute c. Also, when processing (i,c), the required third card would be j only if the pair (i,c) has the same features as needed. But that's only true if the triplet (i,j,c) is a valid set. So if the triplet is valid, then when processing (i,j), we find c. When processing (i,c), we find j. When processing (j,c), we find i. So each valid triplet is counted three times, once for each pair in the triplet. But when we process all possible pairs (i < j), each pair is considered once, but the third card can be anywhere in the list. So for example, for triplet (i,j,k), where i < j < k: when processing (i,j), find k. When processing (i,k), find j. But j is less than k, so the pair (i,k) is processed as i < k. So the third card j would be in the set. So (i,k) would contribute a count if j is present. So in this case, each triplet (i,j,k) where i < j < k is counted three times: once for (i,j), once for (i,k), once for (j,k). So the total count would be the number of triplets multiplied by 3. Therefore, the algorithm would need to count all the pairs (i,j) where the third card exists, then divide by 3 to get the correct answer.

Wait, but in the case where the triplet is (i,j,k) with i < j < k, the three pairs are (i,j), (i,k), (j,k). Each of these pairs would generate the third card. For example:

- Pair (i,j) generates k. If k is present, count +=1.
- Pair (i,k) generates j. If j is present, count +=1.
- Pair (j,k) generates i. If i is present, count +=1.

So each valid triplet contributes exactly 3 to the count. Therefore, the total number of valid triplets is count / 3.

So the approach is:

1. Store all the cards in a set (or a hash set) for O(1) lookups.
2. For every pair of cards (i,j) where i < j, compute the required third card.
3. If that third card exists in the set, increment the count by 1.
4. After processing all pairs, divide the total count by 3 to get the correct number of triplets.

Yes, that makes sense. So the steps are:

- Read n and k.
- Read the n cards into a list, and also store them in a set for O(1) lookups.
- Iterate over all pairs (i,j) where i < j.
- For each pair, compute the required third card's features.
- Check if this card exists in the set.
- If yes, add 1 to the count.
- Finally, the answer is count // 3.

Because each triplet is counted three times (once per pair in the triplet), so dividing by 3 gives the correct count.

Now, the key part is to compute the third card for a given pair (i,j).

How to compute the third feature for each of the k features?

For each feature position (from 0 to k-1), look at the values of the i-th card and the j-th card.

If the two values are the same, then the third card must have the same value.

If the two values are different, then the third value is the one that's not present in the pair. For example, if i's feature is S and j's is E, then the third must be T.

So, for each feature, the possible scenarios are:

Case 1: a == b â†’ c must be a.

Case 2: a and b are different. Then c must be the third possible value.

But how to compute the third value when a and b are different? Let's see:

The possible values are S, E, T.

If a is S and b is E â†’ c is T.

If a is E and b is T â†’ c is S.

If a is S and b is T â†’ c is E.

So, the third value is the one not present in {a, b}.

We can model this with a function that takes two characters and returns the third.

For example, a dictionary that maps pairs to the third value. But since the order of a and b doesn't matter (since a and b are different), we can precompute all possible pairs and their results.

Alternatively, for two different values, the third is the one that's not in the pair.

So for a pair (x, y), where x != y, the third is the element in {'S','E','T'} that is not x or y.

So for each feature of the third card, we can compute it as follows:

def get_third(a, b):

    if a == b:

        return a

    else:

        return ( {'S','E','T'} - {a, b} ).pop()

But how to implement this efficiently?

In Python, for a pair of a and b (each is a character), we can do:

if a == b:

    third_char = a

else:

    for char in ['S', 'E', 'T']:

        if char != a and char != b:

            third_char = char

            break

Alternatively, since the three possible values are S, E, T, we can compute the third character as follows:

The sum of the three is S + E + T in some order. So for example, the set of characters {a, b} has size 2. The third character is the one not in the set.

But since the order is not fixed, perhaps using the sum of the ASCII values. But maybe that's not the best way.

Alternatively, for a and b, if they are different, then the third character can be determined by:

if a and b are different, then the third is the one that's not a or b. So for example, if a is 'S' and b is 'E', the third is 'T'. So:

third_char = ( {'S','E','T'} - {a, b} ).pop()

But in Python, set operations are possible. So for a given a and b, if they are different, create a set of all three, subtract the set {a, b}, and get the remaining element.

But for performance, perhaps precompute a lookup table.

But for k up to 30 and n up to 1500, and pairs up to ~1e6 (1500^2 is 2.25e6), each pair requires k operations. So 2.25e6 * 30 = 6.75e7 operations. That's manageable in Python, but must be optimized.

So, the code would:

For each pair (card1, card2) in the list where i < j:

    compute the required third card's features.

Then check if that third card exists in the set.

Now, how to represent the cards? Each card is a string of length k. So the list is a list of strings, and the set is a set of strings.

So, for each pair of cards, we can loop through each of their features and compute the third feature.

For example:

card1 = "SET"

card2 = "ETS"

for each index in 0..2:

    a = card1[i]

    b = card2[i]

    compute c.

So the third card's features are the concatenation of these c's.

Once we have this third card's string, check if it's in the set.

If it is, then increment the count.

So in code:

cards = [ ... list of strings ... ]

card_set = set(cards)

count = 0

n = len(cards)

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        card1 = cards[i]

        card2 = cards[j]

        third = []

        for c in range(k):

            a = card1[c]

            b = card2[c]

            if a == b:

                third_char = a

            else:

                # find the third character not in a and b

                third_char = list({'S', 'E', 'T'} - {a, b})[0]

            third.append(third_char)

        third_card = ''.join(third)

        if third_card in card_set:

            count +=1

total = count // 3

print(total)

This should work, but the problem is the performance for n=1500. Let's see:

n is 1500, so the number of pairs is 1500*1499/2 = around 1.1e6 (since 1500^2 is 2.25e6, divide by 2 gives ~1.1e6). For each pair, we process k=30 features. So 1.1e6 * 30 = 3.3e7 operations. And for each, we check the existence in a set, which is O(1).

But in Python, even 3e7 operations can be manageable if they are optimized. However, the inner loop for k features in Python can be slow. For example, if k=30, and for each pair, looping 30 times, each time processing characters, this may take a while.

So we need to optimize the computation of the third card.

Alternative idea: precompute for each possible pair of characters, the third character. Create a dictionary that maps (a, b) to the third character. Since a and b can be in any order when they are different, but the third is the same, perhaps we can precompute all possible combinations.

Wait, but when a and b are different, the third character is the same regardless of the order of a and b. So for example, (a, b) and (b, a) would generate the same third character. So for the lookup table, we can handle that.

So the precomputed dictionary could have entries for (a, b) where a <= b (sorted), and then when looking up a pair (x, y), we sort them first and then look up the key.

But maybe it's easier to compute the third character on the fly using set operations, but optimized.

Alternatively, for a and b, if a != b, the third character can be found using the XOR-like method. Let's assign each character to a number:

S â†’ 0, E â†’ 1, T â†’ 2.

Then, for a and b, if they are different, the third can be (3 - a - b) % 3. Let's see:

If a and b are 0 and 1: 3 -0-1=2 â†’ 2 mod 3 â†’ 2 (T), which is correct.

If a and b are 1 and 2: 3-1-2=0 â†’ 0 (S). Correct.

If a and b are 0 and 2: 3-0-2=1 â†’ 1 (E). Correct.

Yes. So, if we map each character to 0, 1, 2, then the third character's code can be (3 - a - b) % 3 if a != b, else a.

So the steps would be:

1. Preprocess each card into a list of integers (0,1,2) for each feature.

2. For each pair of cards (i,j), compute the third card's features as follows:

   For each feature:

      if a == b â†’ code is a.

      else â†’ code is (3 - a - b) %3.

   Then convert the codes back to the characters (S, E, T).

   Then check if the resulting string is in the set.

This approach could be faster because integer operations are quicker than set lookups for each feature.

So, let's proceed with this plan.

First, create a mapping from each character to its code, and vice versa.

char_to_code = {'S':0, 'E':1, 'T':2}

code_to_char = {0:'S', 1:'E', 2:'T'}

Then, for each card, convert it into a list of codes. For example, 'SET' becomes [0, 1, 2].

But wait, the problem is that each card is a string. So for each card in the input, we can precompute a list of integers representing their features. So, for all cards, we can precompute a list of lists, where each sublist is the codes of the features.

Then, for each pair (i,j), and for each feature, compute the code for the third card.

Once all features are computed, convert the list of codes back into a string (using code_to_char for each code) and check if that string is in the card_set.

This approach may save time because:

- Converting the characters to codes once, during preprocessing.

- For each pair, the computation of the third feature is integer operations, which are faster.

So the steps would be:

Read all the cards, convert each into a list of codes. Also, store the original strings in a set.

Then, for each pair (i, j), compute the third card's code list, convert it to a string, and check if it's in the set.

So, code outline:

n, k = map(int, input().split())

cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

card_set = set(cards)

# Precompute the code lists for each card (optional, but we can compute them on the fly)

# Or, for each card in cards, precompute the code list.

pre = []

for card in cards:

    code_list = [char_to_code[c] for c in card]

    pre.append(code_list)

count = 0

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        # get code lists for i and j

        code_i = pre[i]

        code_j = pre[j]

        third_code = []

        for c in range(k):

            a = code_i[c]

            b = code_j[c]

            if a == b:

                third_code.append(a)

            else:

                third = (3 - a - b) %3

                third_code.append(third)

        # convert third_code to string

        third_str = ''.join([code_to_char[code] for code in third_code])

        if third_str in card_set:

            count +=1

total = count //3

print(total)

But this would require precomputing the code lists for all cards, which is O(nk) time. Then, for each pair, processing each feature as O(1) operations.

This should be more efficient than the previous approach.

But what about the time taken to convert the code list back to a string? For each pair, this is O(k) operations. For n=1500, this is 1e6 pairs, each requiring O(30) operations â†’ 3e7 operations. That's manageable, but perhaps we can optimize this.

Alternative idea: precompute all possible third cards for pairs (i,j), but this is not feasible as there are too many pairs.

Another idea: memoize the third_str. But for each pair, the third_str is unique. But there's no overlap, so memoization won't help.

Alternatively, can we compute a hash of the third card's features without converting to a string? For example, precompute the code lists for all cards, and for each code list, compute a tuple or some hashable representation, and store these in a set. Then, when computing the third card's code list, check if that code list exists in the precomputed set.

But how?

Wait, the cards are stored as strings, but we could precompute a set of tuples (each code list is a tuple) as well. So for each card, the code list is a tuple, and we have a set of these tuples. Then, when we compute the third code list as a tuple, we can check if it's in the tuple set.

But the problem is that the original card strings are all unique, so the tuples would also be unique. So, for example:

card_set_tuples = set( tuple(pre[i]) for i in range(n) )

Then, for the third_code list, convert it to a tuple and check if it's in card_set_tuples.

This way, converting from code list to tuple is O(k) time, but checking is O(1). But for each pair, this is O(k) time to create the tuple.

But in Python, creating a tuple of length 30 is not too bad, but for 1e6 pairs, 30*1e6 = 3e7 operations. It's manageable, but maybe the time is comparable to converting to a string.

Alternatively, maybe the code to generate the third_str can be optimized.

Wait, but converting the code list to a string requires k steps: for each code in the list, look up the character in code_to_char, then join. For k=30, that's 30 steps per pair.

But using the tuple approach would avoid the need to generate the string, but the original card_set is a set of strings, so the code list's tuple is not in that set. So that approach wouldn't work unless we also store the code list tuples in a set.

So, the idea is:

precompute a set of all code list tuples.

card_tuples = set( tuple(code_list) for code_list in pre )

Then, when we generate the third_code as a tuple, check if it exists in card_tuples.

But how to map the third_code tuple back to the original string? Because the original card strings are unique, but the code list tuples are unique as well. So, if the third_code tuple is in card_tuples, then there exists a card in the original list that has exactly those codes. Then, that card's string is the one that forms the set.

But how to verify that the third_code tuple is present in the card_tuples.

So in code:

third_tuple = tuple(third_code)

if third_tuple in card_tuples:

    count +=1

But this is O(1) check. And generating the third_tuple is O(k) steps.

But generating the tuple may be faster than generating a string.

So, perhaps using tuples instead of strings for the set could be faster.

So, let's adjust the code:

precompute the code lists as tuples.

card_tuples = set()

pre = []

for card in cards:

    code_list = tuple([char_to_code[c] for c in card])

    pre.append(code_list)

card_tuples = set(pre)

Then, for each pair (i,j):

compute the third_code as a list, then convert to a tuple. Check if it's in card_tuples.

So, the code becomes:

count =0

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        third_code = []

        for c in range(k):

            a = pre[i][c]

            b = pre[j][c]

            if a == b:

                third = a

            else:

                third = (3 - a - b) %3

            third_code.append(third)

        third_tuple = tuple(third_code)

        if third_tuple in card_tuples:

            count +=1

This avoids converting to a string and checking in the original set of strings. However, the original cards are stored as strings, but their code tuples are stored in card_tuples. But since each card's code tuple is unique and corresponds to the original string, the check is equivalent.

This approach may be faster because tuples are hashable and can be compared more quickly. But in practice, the time saved by avoiding the string conversion (k steps for each pair) could be significant.

So this seems like a viable optimization.

But how much time would this save? Let's see.

For each pair:

Original approach:

- For each of k features, compute third_char (using set operations or code lookup).

- Convert the list of third_chars into a string: k steps.

- Check if the string is in the card_set: O(1).

New approach:

- For each of k features, compute the third code (integer operations).

- Convert the code list into a tuple: k steps (since creating a list and then converting to a tuple is O(k)).

- Check if the tuple is in card_tuples: O(1).

But the code for generating the third code is integer arithmetic, which is faster than set operations. So this is a win.

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    cards = [input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip() for _ in range(n)]

    pre = [tuple([char_to_code[c] for c in card]) for card in cards]

    count =0

    n_cards = len(pre)

        for j in range(i+1, n_cards):

            for c in range(k):

                a = pre[i][c]

                    third.append(a)

                else:

                    third.append( (3 - a - b) %3 )

            third_tuple = tuple(third)

            if third_tuple in card_tuples:

Third example:

Not sure, but according to the sample, the code would output 2.

Assuming the code works.

Now, the code's time complexity is O(n^2 *k) + O(nk) (preprocessing). For n=1500, k=30, 1500^2*30 = 67,500,000 operations, which is manageable in Python, given that 3 seconds is 3e8 operations. 67 million is 6.7e7, which is about 0.067e9. So within 3 seconds, this should be possible.

But in Python, loops are generally slower than in C++. So can this code handle the maximum case?

Yes, for 1500 *1500 = 2.25e6 pairs. For each pair, 30 steps, that's 67.5e6 steps. Then, creating a tuple of 30 elements each time and checking in the set. Python can handle this.

But there's another optimization: precompute all the code lists as tuples, then for each pair, generate the third tuple using list comprehensions or other vectorized operations.

Alternatively, using bitmasking for the features, but since there are 3 possibilities per feature, and k is up to 30, which is 3^30 possible combinations. But that's way too big for any bitmasking.

Another optimization: precompute the third tuple for each pair (i,j) using a vectorized approach. For example, using numpy arrays for the code lists and compute the third code in a vectorized way. But in Python, with the given constraints, perhaps it's not necessary, and the code as written is sufficient.

Another possible optimization: precompute for each card's code list, and for each pair, compute the third code list as a list comprehension.

In Python, list comprehensions are faster than appending in a loop.

So in the code, for each pair (i,j), the third code list can be generated as:

third = [ (a if a == b else (3 -a -b)%3 ) for a, b in zip(pre[i], pre[j]) ]

third_tuple = tuple(third)

So this would replace the loop over the features with a list comprehension, which is faster.

So modifying the code:

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        third = [ (a if a == b else (3 -a -b)%3 ) for a, b in zip(pre[i], pre[j]) ]

        if tuple(third) in card_tuples:

            count +=1

This way, the loop over k features is replaced with a list comprehension, which is faster in Python.

Yes, this should save some time.

So the code becomes:

n, k = map(int, input().split())

cards = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

char_to_code = {'S':0, 'E':1, 'T':2}

pre = [tuple([char_to_code[c] for c in card]) for card in cards]

card_tuples = set(pre)

count = 0

n_cards = len(pre)

for i in range(n_cards):

    ci = pre[i]

    for j in range(i+1, n_cards):

        cj = pre[j]

        third = [ (a if a == b else (3 - a - b) %3 ) for a, b in zip(ci, cj) ]

        if tuple(third) in card_tuples:

            count +=1

print(count //3)

This should be faster, as the list comprehension is more optimized.

Another possible optimization is to avoid creating a list and then converting to a tuple each time. For example, use a generator expression to create the tuple directly.

third = tuple( (a if a == b else (3 - a - b) %3 ) for a, b in zip(ci, cj) )

So:

third = tuple( (a if a == b else (3 - a - b) %3 ) for a, b in zip(ci, cj) )

if third in card_tuples:

    count +=1

Yes, this way, we directly create a tuple without the intermediate list. This is more efficient.

So the code is further optimized:

...

third = tuple( (a if a == b else (3 - a - b) %3 ) for a, b in zip(ci, cj) )

if third in card_tuples:

    count +=1

...

This should save some time, as creating the tuple directly from the generator is faster.

Another possible optimization: precompute all the code tuples and store them in a list. Then, for each pair, compute the third tuple as described.

Yes, this is what the code does.

In terms of memory, for n=1500 and k=30, each code tuple is 30 integers. So each tuple is 30 * 28 bytes (assuming 28 bytes per int in a tuple, but in reality, tuples are more compact). But even if each tuple is 300 bytes, 1500 of them would be 450 KB, which is manageable.

The set of tuples would take more memory, but again, for 1500 elements, it's acceptable.

Thus, the code should work within the time and memory constraints.

Now, let's verify the third example.

Third example input:

5 4

SETT â†’ codes 0,1,2,2

TEST â†’ 2,1,0,2

EEET â†’ 1,1,1,2

ESTE â†’ 1,0,2,1

STES â†’ 0,2,1,0

So the code tuples are:

SETT â†’ (0,1,2,2)

TEST â†’ (2,1,0,2)

EEET â†’ (1,1,1,2)

ESTE â†’ (1,0,2,1)

STES â†’ (0,2,1,0)

card_tuples is the set of these tuples.

Now, for each pair (i,j):

For example, pair (0,1):

compute third tuple.

For each feature:

0 vs 2 â†’ different â†’ 3-0-2 =1.

1 vs1 â†’ same â†’1.

2 vs0 â†’ different â†’3-2-0=1.

2 vs2 â†’ same â†’2.

third tuple is (1,1,1,2), which is EEET (third card 2). So this triplet (0,1,2) is valid. So count increments by1.

Similarly, other pairs may contribute.

Another valid triplet is (1,3,4). Let's see:

TEST (1) â†’ (2,1,0,2)

ESTE (3) â†’ (1,0,2,1)

STES (4) â†’ (0,2,1,0)

Pair (1,3):

compute third tuple.

feature 0: 2 vs1 â†’ 0.

feature1:1 vs0 â†’ 2.

feature2:0 vs2 â†’ (3-0-2) =1.

feature3:2 vs1 â†’ 0.

so third tuple is (0,2,1,0) â†’ which is STES (4). So the triplet (1,3,4) is valid. So when processing pair (1,3), the third is 4. Since 4 is present, count +=1.

But the pair (1,3) is i=1, j=3. The third is card4, which is in the set. So this contributes to count.

Other pairs:

When the code processes all possible pairs, the two valid triplets will each contribute 3 to the count, resulting in a total of 6 (2 triplets *3 pairs each), so 6//3=2.

Thus, the code will output 2 as required.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.

The code is now optimized as much as possible, using tuples and integer codes, and list comprehensions to minimize loop overhead.
