<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the problem is about finding the minimal prefix of the command sequence such that no matter where the robot starts (in any passable cell), after executing those commands, the robot ends up at the exit. If there's no such prefix, we return -1. If the exit is the only possible cell, then the answer is 0.

First, I need to understand what the robot does. For each command in the sequence, the robot attempts to move in the direction specified. If the next cell in that direction is a wall, it doesn't move. Otherwise, it moves. We need to process all the commands up to some prefix and ensure that after all these steps, the robot is at the exit E, regardless of its starting position.

So the key is to model all possible positions the robot could be in after each step of the command sequence, and check if after a certain step, all possible positions are exactly the exit.

Hmm. How can we model this efficiently? Because the grid can be up to 150x150, which is 22500 cells. For each step in the command sequence (up to 1e5 steps), tracking all possible positions could be expensive if done naively. But since k can be up to 1e5, a brute-force approach that tracks all possible positions for each step would be O(k * n*m), which for 1e5 * 22500 is 2.25e9 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, but the problem is that after each step, the possible positions are a subset of the grid. The initial set is all passable cells except the exit. Wait, no: the robot can start anywhere, including the exit. But we need to make sure that after processing the prefix, regardless of the starting position, the robot ends at the exit. So for all possible starting positions, after applying the prefix, the robot is at E.

So the approach is: after each step in the command sequence, determine the set of possible positions that the robot could be in. Once this set is exactly the singleton {E}, then that's the minimal prefix. If at any point, after processing up to the i-th command, all possible positions after i commands are E, then i is the answer.

But tracking this set for each step is going to be O(k * nm), which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So we need a way to model this more efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each cell (x, y), determine the earliest time (prefix length) when applying the first t commands will move the robot from (x,y) to E. Then, the answer is the maximum of all these earliest times. Because for all starting cells, the robot must reach E by the prefix. So the minimal t where the maximum of the required steps for each cell is <= t.

Wait, that's an interesting idea. Let's see. For each cell (x,y), compute the minimal number of steps t such that after applying the first t commands, the robot starting at (x,y) ends up at E. Then, the answer is the maximum t across all (x,y) (since all must reach E by then), and the minimal such maximum. But how do we compute this?

But processing each cell's path through the commands might be manageable. Let's see: For each cell (x,y), simulate the sequence of commands and see after which step it reaches E. Then, the answer is the maximum of all these steps, and the earliest prefix where this maximum is achieved.

But the problem is that the command sequence can be up to 1e5 steps. For each cell, simulating 1e5 steps would be O(k * nm) time again, which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations. That's way too slow for Python.

So this approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.

Wait, but perhaps we can precompute for each cell and each command step, the position after applying the commands up to that step. Then, for each cell, find the earliest step where it reaches E and remains there. But again, this seems to require O(k * nm) storage, which is impossible.

Alternative idea: We can reverse the process. Instead of simulating forward for each cell, simulate backwards from E. Because after the commands are applied, the robot must be at E. So we can model the possible positions in reverse: starting from E, and applying the inverse of each command in reverse order. The inverse here is that each command's reverse would be a movement in the opposite direction. For example, applying a command L (left) in the original sequence would, in reverse, be moving right (since in reverse processing, the robot's position after the command would be determined by where it was before the command). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in reverse steps.

Let me think. Suppose the original command sequence is C1, C2, ..., Ct. To reach E after t steps, the robot's position after t-1 steps must be such that moving according to Ct would take it to E. But how?

Wait, if we process the commands in reverse order, starting from E. For each step in reverse, we can track the set of possible positions that the robot could have been in before applying the current command.

So, let's see. Let's denote the exit as the target. For each step t (from k down to 0), we track the set of positions S_t such that if the robot is in S_t after t steps, then applying the remaining (k - t) steps (if any) would bring it to E. But in this problem, we need that after the prefix of length t, all possible starting positions end up at E. So the minimal t such that after applying the first t commands, the robot is at E, regardless of starting position.

Wait, this approach might help. Let's think about the reverse process. The idea is to find all positions that would end up in E after applying the first t commands. For the answer to be valid, all possible starting positions must be in this set. So the minimal t is the earliest step where the reverse process's set includes all possible starting positions.

So how to model the reverse process:

We start from E at step 0 (after applying t steps). Then, for each step i from 1 to t, we process the commands in reverse order and track the possible positions that could have led to the current set.

But since we need to find the minimal t where the reverse process covers all possible starting positions, perhaps we can model this with BFS layers. Each layer represents the set of positions that can reach E in exactly i steps (after processing i commands). The minimal i where all passable cells are in this set is our answer.

Yes! So here's the plan:

- Reverse the command sequence. For each step in the reversed sequence (from last to first), compute the set of positions that can reach E in i steps (i being the number of steps in the reversed sequence). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, for each possible t, we want to check if, after applying the first t commands, all starting positions end up at E. To check this, for each starting position, after applying the first t commands, the robot must be at E. So, for each t, the set of possible positions after t commands (applied from any starting position) must be exactly {E}.

So the problem is to find the smallest t where this condition holds.

To model this, we can track for each step t (from 0 to k), the set of positions that the robot could be in after t commands. Once this set is {E}, then t is a candidate. The minimal such t is the answer.

But tracking the set for each step is O(k * nm), which is again expensive for large k.

Hmm. But perhaps there's a way to represent this set more efficiently. For example, using BFS in reverse, where we track the minimal steps required to reach E.

Wait, here's an idea: For each position (x,y), compute the earliest time t where applying the first t commands leads the robot from (x,y) to E. Then, the answer is the maximum of all these t's. Because all starting positions must reach E by time t, so the maximum t among all positions is the minimal prefix length required.

But how to compute the t for each (x,y) efficiently?

But simulating each position's movement through all commands is O(k) per position, which is O(k*nm) time. For k=1e5 and nm=22500, that's 2.25e9 operations, which is way too slow for Python.

So this approach is not feasible. Need a better way.

Alternative approach: Precompute for each step in the command sequence, the possible positions. Let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem. Initially, after 0 steps, the robot is in all possible passable positions. Then, for each command in the sequence, we compute the next possible positions based on the current positions.

But again, for each step, this would require O(nm) operations, which for 1e5 steps would be 2.25e9 operations. Not feasible.

Wait, but maybe the set of possible positions can be represented as a grid of booleans, and for each step, we can compute the next positions efficiently using bitwise operations or something. But in Python, even that may not be fast enough.

Alternative idea: Since the exit is a single cell, perhaps for each command step, we can track the cells that can reach the exit in the remaining steps. So in reverse order, we can track for each step how the possible positions expand.

Let me think in reverse. Suppose we have a command sequence of length k. We want to find the earliest t (t <=k) such that, after applying the first t commands, any starting position leads to E. So in reverse, we can process the commands from the end to the beginning, and track the set of positions that can reach E in the remaining steps.

Wait, here's the key insight. Let's process the commands in reverse order, and for each reversed step, track the set of positions that can reach E after the remaining steps. If, after processing some reversed steps, the set includes all passable cells, then the minimal t is k - reversed_steps.

For example, the original commands are C1, C2, ..., Ct. In reverse, we process Ct, Ct-1, ..., C1. For each step in the reversed processing, we track the positions that can reach E in i steps (i being the number of steps processed in reverse). Once all passable cells are in the current set, then the answer is i.

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but let's formalize this.

Let's reverse the command sequence and process each command in reverse order. Let's denote the reversed commands as R_1, R_2, ..., R_k, where R_1 is the last command of the original sequence.

We can model the positions that can reach E after the remaining i steps (i steps from the original sequence's end). Initially, i=0: the set is {E}. For each step i from 1 to k, we compute the possible positions that could reach E after processing the next i commands (in reverse order). For each R_i (original command C_{k - i + 1}), we compute the possible positions by considering the movement that would have been done in the original step.

Wait, perhaps the reverse processing works like this:

Suppose we have processed i steps in reverse, and the current set is S_i. Then, when processing step i+1 (which is the original command C_{k - i}), we compute S_{i+1} as the set of positions such that, if the robot was in position p before applying C_{k - i}, and then moves according to C_{k - i}, it would end up in S_i.

Wait, no. Because in reverse processing, for each original command, we need to find all possible positions that could lead to S_i when the command is applied.

For example, let's say the original command is 'L' (left). The robot would move left if possible. So in reverse, for a current position p in S_i, the possible positions before the command are those that, when moving left (as per the original command), would end up in p.

But how?

In reverse processing, for each command C, to find the possible positions before executing C that could lead to the current set after executing C.

So for a command C (original direction), the reverse is to find positions p such that when moving in direction C, you end up in a position in the current set.

Wait, maybe this is the correct way. Let's take the original command C. Let's say the current set after processing the next commands (in reverse) is S. To find the positions that can reach S after applying C, we have to:

For each position p in S, check what positions could have moved into p when command C was applied. These positions are either p's neighbor in the opposite direction of C (since when you apply C, you move from that neighbor to p if possible), or p itself if moving in direction C was blocked (so the robot stayed in p).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Suppose the original command is 'L' (move left). When the robot is in position (x,y), it will try to move left to (x, y-1). If that cell is a wall, it stays in (x,y). So, in reverse, to find the positions that could have ended up in S after applying 'L', we need to find all positions (a, b) such that when 'L' is applied, (a, b) moves into S.

So for a position (x, y) in S, the possible previous positions are:

- (x, y), if when applying 'L' from (x, y) the movement is blocked. That is, if (x, y-1) is a wall. Then, applying 'L' would leave the robot in (x,y).

Or,

- (x, y+1), because moving left from (x, y+1) would take the robot to (x, y). But only if (x, y) is passable (since movement is allowed only to passable cells).

Wait, no. The movement depends on the original command and the cell's structure.

So for a command 'L', which is moving left (y decreases by 1 if possible), the reverse step would be considering all positions that, when moving left, would end up in S. These positions are either:

1. Positions in S that couldn't move left (so they stayed). So for each (x, y) in S, if (x, y-1) is a wall, then (x, y) is a possible previous position.

2. Positions (x, y+1) where moving left would take them to (x, y), which is in S, and (x, y) is passable.

So in reverse processing, for each command C, the previous positions are:

For each (x, y) in the current set S:

- If moving in direction C from (x', y') would result in (x, y), then (x', y') is a possible previous position.

For example, for command 'L', the possible (x', y') are:

Either (x, y) (if moving left from (x, y) was blocked, i.e., (x, y-1) is a wall), or (x, y+1) (since moving left from (x, y+1) would reach (x, y)), provided that (x, y) is a passable cell.

So the reverse processing for each command C would generate a new set S_prev by adding all possible (x', y') that could have led into S after applying C.

This way, processing in reverse order allows us to track all possible starting positions that would reach E after applying the first t commands. And once the S_prev covers all passable cells, then t is the answer.

The advantage of this approach is that each step in reverse processing can be done in O(nm) time, but since we need to process up to k steps, it's O(k nm) time, which again for k=1e5 is 2.25e9 operations. That's way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible unless there's a way to stop early. For example, once during the reverse processing, the set S_prev becomes all passable cells, we can stop and return the current step count.

Wait, but what's the step count here? Suppose we process the commands in reverse order. Let's say after processing i steps in reverse (i.e., the first i commands in reverse, which are the last i commands in the original sequence), the set S_i is the set of positions that can reach E after executing the original commands from position k - i to k (assuming 0-based). Then, if S_i includes all passable cells, then the answer is i. Because applying the last i commands (from the original sequence) would bring any starting position to E. But that's not exactly the same as the problem's requirement.

Wait, no. The problem requires that after processing the first t commands (from the original sequence), the robot is at E. The reverse approach is modeling the positions that can reach E after processing the entire command sequence. But to find the minimal t where after t steps (the first t commands) the robot is at E regardless of the starting position, this approach might not directly model that.

Alternatively, maybe the reverse approach can be adjusted to track for each step how the set of positions that must end up at E after exactly t steps.

But perhaps another angle: the minimal t is the earliest step where for all possible starting positions, executing the first t commands leads the robot to E. To model this, we can track the possible positions after t commands, and check if all of them are E.

The problem is that simulating this for each step is O(k * nm), which is too slow. So we need a way to model this more efficiently.

Wait, but perhaps after some steps, the set of possible positions converges to a fixed set, and once it's a singleton {E}, we can stop. So for example, after each step, if the possible positions are exactly {E}, then that's the answer.

But even that doesn't help, because the steps required could be up to 1e5.

Alternative idea: Since the robot's movement is deterministic, for each cell, the path is determined by the commands. So, for each cell, after processing t commands, the robot's position is fixed. So for each cell (x,y), we can compute the position after t commands. Then, the answer is the minimal t where all these positions are E.

But again, computing this for each cell and each step is O(k * nm), which is not feasible.

Wait, but perhaps we can model the movement for each cell as a function of the commands. For example, for a cell (x,y), the path through the commands can be tracked once, but how?

Alternatively, note that the movement for a cell (x,y) depends on the sequence of commands. The robot moves in each step if possible. So for each cell (x,y), the path is unique once the commands are known.

But for 22500 cells and 1e5 steps, this is 22500 * 1e5 = 2.25e9 operations, which is way too slow for Python.

Another thought: Since the exit is a single cell, perhaps after some steps, all cells have their path leading to E. But how can we precompute for each cell when it reaches E and stays there?

Wait, once a cell's path reaches E, if the subsequent commands don't move it out of E, then that's fine. But if the commands after that step cause it to move away from E, then that cell's path would no longer end at E. So the problem requires that after the entire prefix, all paths end at E.

Thus, for each cell, the earliest step t where, after processing the first t commands, the cell's path is at E, and for all steps >=t, the path remains at E. Then, the answer is the maximum of these t's across all cells.

But again, finding this t for each cell would require simulating the entire command sequence, which is O(k) per cell.

Hmm. So this seems stuck.

Wait, but maybe the exit cell is E. Once a cell's path reaches E, all subsequent commands would not move it away from E, since moving from E is allowed only if the adjacent cell is passable. But since E is passable, and the robot could be in E, then subsequent commands could move it away. For example, if after step t, the robot is at E, but in step t+1, there's a command to move left, and E's left is a passable cell. Then the robot would move left, leaving E. So that cell's path would leave E again. So that would be a problem.

Thus, the minimal t must be such that after step t, the robot is at E and remains there for all steps from t to the end of the prefix.

Wait, no. The problem states that after the entire prefix is executed (the first t commands), the robot must be at E. It doesn't matter if during the execution of the prefix, the robot leaves and returns. Only the final position matters.

Ah, right. So the problem only requires that after all the prefix's commands are processed (the first t commands), the robot is at E, regardless of its starting position. So the path can go through E and leave, as long as after t steps it's back to E.

Thus, for each cell (x,y), we need to find the earliest step t where the robot ends up at E after t steps. Then, the answer is the maximum of all such t's.

So the problem reduces to computing, for each cell (x,y), the earliest step t where applying the first t commands leads to E. Then, the answer is the maximum of these t's across all cells.

If the maximum is <=k, then output that maximum. Otherwise, output -1.

But how to compute these t's efficiently?

This is the crux of the problem. Let's think about how to compute for each cell the earliest t where it reaches E.

But each cell's movement is determined by the command sequence. So, for each cell, we can simulate the commands step by step, keeping track of the position. For each cell (x,y), we can simulate until it reaches E, and note the earliest t where this happens. Then, the answer is the maximum of these t's.

But again, with 22500 cells and 1e5 steps, this is 2.25e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.

So, the problem is to find a way to compute all cells' earliest steps to reach E efficiently.

Alternative idea: Precompute for each command step, the possible positions that can reach E in the remaining steps. This is similar to dynamic programming. Let's consider the reverse approach again, but this time track for each step (in reverse) the positions that can reach E in that number of steps.

Let me think again. Let's process the commands in reverse order. For each step in reverse, we can track the set of positions that can reach E in the remaining steps. For example, if after processing the last i commands in reverse, the set S_i contains all positions that would reach E when applying those i commands (in reverse order). Then, the answer is the smallest i such that S_i includes all passable cells. Because processing those i commands in reverse corresponds to the last i commands in the original sequence, but perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, processing the commands in reverse order allows us to model the possible positions that would reach E after the original sequence of commands. For example, processing the commands from the last to the first allows us to find the positions that can reach E if they start at step t and proceed to the end.

But the problem requires that after the first t commands (from the original sequence), all possible starting positions have reached E. So for any starting position, after executing the first t commands, the robot is at E. How does this relate to processing in reverse?

Hmm. Maybe the reverse approach can be used to find the earliest t where all passable cells are in the set S_t, where S_t represents the set of positions that can reach E by executing the first t commands.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the reverse process again.

Suppose the original command sequence is C_1, C_2, ..., C_k. We want to find the earliest t where, for all starting positions, executing C_1 to C_t results in E.

In reverse processing, we can model the positions that, after applying C_t, C_{t-1}, ..., C_1, end up at E. If the set of these positions includes all passable cells, then t is the answer.

Wait, perhaps this is the way. Let me see.

Reverse processing steps:

Start with S_0 = {E} (after 0 steps, only E is in the set).

For each step i from 1 to k (processing the commands in reverse order), compute S_i as the set of positions that can reach S_{i-1} by applying the command C_{i} (original command C_i). So S_i represents the positions that, after applying the first i commands (original C_1 to C_i), the robot would end up in E after the remaining k - i commands (assuming the original sequence is k steps). Wait, no, perhaps not exactly. Let's think:

The reverse processing is done as follows. We process the commands in reverse order (C_k, C_{k-1}, ..., C_1). For each step i in 1..k, we compute S_i, the set of positions that, when applying the i-th command in reverse (which is the original command C_{k - i + 1}), can lead to S_{i-1}.

So S_0 is {E}, meaning after 0 reverse steps (i.e., after processing all original commands), the robot is at E.

S_1 is the set of positions that, after applying the original command C_k, would end up in S_0 (i.e., E). So these are the positions that can reach E by applying command C_k.

S_2 is the positions that, after applying C_{k-1} followed by C_k, end up in E. So S_2 is the set of positions that, when applying C_{k-1}, can reach S_1.

In this way, S_i represents the set of positions that can reach E after applying the last i commands of the original sequence.

Wait, no. If we process the original commands in reverse order, then S_i is the set of positions that can reach E after applying the last i commands (from original C_{k-i+1} to C_k}).

So, for example, S_1 is the set of positions that can reach E by applying command C_k. S_2 is the set of positions that can reach E by applying C_{k-1} and then C_k.

But the problem requires that after applying the first t commands (C_1 to C_t), the robot is at E. So, how does this relate to the reverse processing?

Ah! If during reverse processing, after processing i steps (commands C_k, C_{k-1}, ..., C_{k-i+1}), the set S_i includes all passable cells, then applying those i commands (in the original order, which is C_{k-i+1} ... C_k} as the last i commands) would mean that any starting position, when those i commands are applied, ends up at E. But that's not directly the first t commands. However, if we process all k commands in reverse and for some i, S_i includes all passable cells, then the minimal t is k - i. Because applying the first k - i commands would leave the robot at a position from which applying the last i commands brings it to E. But if S_i is all passable cells, then any starting position after k -i commands must end up in E when the last i commands are applied. Wait, this seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, suppose that the answer is t. Then, after applying the first t commands, all passable cells must end up at E. So, regardless of the starting position, applying the first t commands leads to E. Then, applying the remaining k -t commands (if any) would take the robot from E to some other positions. But the problem requires that after the first t commands, the robot is at E. So the remaining commands don't matter for the answer.

So the reverse approach must model the minimal t such that after the first t commands, all passable cells have their path leading to E. So, the reverse approach must track the positions that can reach E after exactly t steps (the first t commands). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reverse approach can be modified to find the earliest t where, after applying the first t commands, all passable cells are in the set that reaches E. But I'm not sure.

Let's think differently. Let's imagine that we process the commands in forward order, and for each step t, track the set of positions S_t that the robot could be in after executing the first t commands. Initially, S_0 is all passable cells. For each step, S_{t} is computed from S_{t-1} by applying the command C_t. If, at any step t, S_t is exactly {E}, then t is the answer.

But in the worst case, for each step, we have to process all cells in S_{t-1} to compute S_t. But this is O(nm) per step, which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations. Not feasible.

But perhaps we can represent S_t as a bitmask or a grid, and compute it efficiently. For example, for each command, we can precompute the movement for each cell and track which cells are in the next set.

But even then, for 1e5 steps, this is expensive.

Wait, but maybe we can stop processing as soon as S_t becomes {E}. Because once that happens, we can return t as the answer. So in the best case, if after a few steps all positions converge to E, we can stop early.

But how quickly does S_t converge to {E}? It depends on the commands and the grid. For example, if all commands are moving towards E, perhaps the set shrinks quickly. But in the worst case, it could take all k steps.

But given that k can be up to 1e5, even with early termination, this approach may not be feasible for the worst case.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. I need to find a way to compute for each cell the earliest step when it reaches E and then take the maximum of these steps.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternative Idea:

For each cell (x,y), the path it takes through the commands is deterministic. So, for each cell, we can precompute the path until it reaches E and record the step when that happens. Then, the answer is the maximum of all those steps.

But with 22500 cells and 1e5 steps each, this is 2.25e9 steps, which is impossible in Python.

But wait, maybe there's a way to precompute the movements for each cell once and track when they reach E.

Alternatively, can we model the movement for each cell as a function and find when they reach E?

Wait, but for each command, the movement is fixed. For example, for a cell (x,y), the sequence of positions after each command is determined by the commands and the walls. So, for each cell, we can precompute the entire path until it reaches E, or until the end of the commands.

But even this is O(k * nm) time, which is not feasible.

Alternative approach: We can model the movement of all cells in parallel. For example, for each step, compute the next position of each cell. This way, for each step, we process all cells in O(1) time per cell. But this requires O(nm) per step.

But again, for 1e5 steps, it's not feasible.

Wait, but perhaps we can use memoization. For example, if multiple cells have the same path after a certain step, we can track them together. But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The problem requires that all cells eventually reach E. So, for each cell, there must be a path through the command sequence that leads it to E. If any cell's path does not reach E even after all k commands, then the answer is -1.

But how to check this.

But even checking this requires processing all cells' paths, which is O(k * nm) time.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is designed such that the optimal solution requires this reverse approach with O(k + nm) time, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reverse approach can be optimized. Let's consider the reverse approach:

We start with S = {E}, and process the commands in reverse order. For each command, we expand S to include all positions that could lead into S after executing the command. For each step, we track S. The moment S includes all passable cells, the answer is the current step count.

The reverse approach processes commands in reverse order. For each command, the current set S represents all positions that can reach E after processing the commands up to that point in the reverse order (which is the original commands from that point onwards).

For example, processing the commands in reverse order from k to 1:

- After 0 steps (reverse), S = {E} → applying the last 0 commands (original k to k+1? Not sure) → but this is the initial state.

- After processing the first reverse command (original command k), S becomes the set of positions that can reach E in one step (original command k).

- Processing the next reverse command (original command k-1), S becomes the set of positions that can reach the previous S in two steps (original commands k-1 and k).

- Continue this until S covers all passable cells. The number of reverse steps required is the minimal t such that the original first (k - t) commands must be processed, and then the remaining t commands bring all cells to E.

Wait, no. The reverse steps are t steps in the reversed command order. So, for example, if we process t reverse steps (original commands C_k, C_{k-1}, ..., C_{k - t + 1}), then the set S represents the positions that can reach E after applying these t commands. So, if S includes all passable cells, then applying these t commands (original C_{k - t + 1} to C_k) would bring any starting position to E. So the minimal prefix is k - t. Because the original prefix would be from C_1 to C_{k - t}, and the remaining t commands bring all positions to E.

Wait, no. If after t reverse steps, S includes all passable cells, then the required prefix is k - t. Because the original sequence is processed up to command k - t, and the remaining t commands (from k - t + 1 to k) would bring all positions to E. So the total prefix is k - t steps. But the problem requires that after executing the prefix (the first t' steps of the original sequence), the robot is at E. So t' is k - t.

Thus, the minimal t' is the minimal k - t such that after t reverse steps, S includes all passable cells. So, during the reverse processing, whenever S covers all passable cells, we can record the required prefix as k - t, and choose the minimal such prefix.

If after processing all k reverse steps, S does not cover all passable cells, then the answer is -1.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The reverse approach requires processing each command in reverse order, and for each step, compute the new set S based on the previous S and the command.

But how to compute S efficiently.

For each reverse step:

For each position in the current S, we need to find all possible positions that could have moved into S after applying the original command (in forward direction).

So, for example, for the original command C, which is part of the reverse processing steps, we compute the possible previous positions.

So for the reverse step (processing command C), the new set S_prev is the union of all positions that could reach S_prev after applying C.

The algorithm would be:

Initialize S as {E}.

For each command in reverse order (from last to first):

    new_S = empty set

    for each position (x, y) in S:

        // find all possible previous positions that could reach (x,y) when command C is applied.

        // for command C:

        // possible previous positions are:

        // 1. (x, y) if moving C from (x,y) is blocked.

        // 2. the position from which moving C would land at (x, y), if that position is passable.

        // So, for each (x, y) in S, add to new_S the positions that could transition to (x, y) when C is applied.

        if C is 'L':

            // original command is L: move left (y decreases by 1 if possible)

            // reverse step: find positions that when moving L would end up in (x,y)

            // possible positions are:

            // a. (x, y) if moving left from (x,y) is blocked (i.e., y-1 is wall)

            // or (x, y+1) if moving left from (x, y+1) leads to (x,y), which is passable.

            // Check if (x, y) is passable (since robot can only move to passable cells).

            if grid[x][y] is not '.' and not 'E':

                continue  # but S contains E and passable cells, so grid[x][y] must be passable.

            // Check if (x, y-1) is a wall. If yes, then (x, y) is a possible previous position.

            if (x, y-1) is a wall:

                add (x, y) to new_S.

            // Check if (x, y+1) is passable.

            if (x, y+1) is passable:

                add (x, y+1) to new_S.

        elif C is 'R':

            // similar logic.

            if (x, y+1) is a wall:

                add (x, y) to new_S.

            if (x, y-1) is passable:

                add (x, y-1) to new_S.

        elif C is 'U':

            // moving up decreases x by 1.

            if (x-1, y) is a wall:

                add (x, y) to new_S.

            if (x+1, y) is passable:

                add (x+1, y) to new_S.

        elif C is 'D':

            // moving down increases x by 1.

            if (x+1, y) is a wall:

                add (x, y) to new_S.

            if (x-1, y) is passable:

                add (x-1, y) to new_S.

    S = new_S (but remove duplicates and walls)

    check if S includes all passable cells. If yes, return k - t where t is the number of reverse steps processed.

But even this approach, in the worst case, would take O(k * nm) operations, which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 steps, which is way too slow for Python.

But perhaps we can represent S as a 2D array of booleans, and for each reverse step, compute new_S using bitmask-like operations. For example, for each command, we can precompute for each cell whether it can contribute to the new_S.

But again, this would require O(nm) time per reverse step.

But wait, the number of reverse steps we need to process is up to k, but perhaps the S can reach all passable cells before k steps. So if during the reverse processing, after some steps, S includes all passable cells, we can break early.

But the problem is that for each reverse step, we have to process all cells in the current S. If S is large, this is expensive. However, since we're processing in reverse order, S starts as {E} and grows with each reverse step.

So for example, in the first reverse step (processing the last command), S may expand to some positions. Then, in the next reverse steps, S expands further. Once S covers all passable cells, we can stop.

But how often does this happen early? It depends on the commands and the grid. But in the worst case, it may require all k reverse steps.

So for a grid with all passable cells except the perimeter walls, and commands that move all cells towards E, the S may expand rapidly, leading to an early exit. But in other cases, it may take many steps.

But even so, in the worst case, this is O(k * nm) time, which is not feasible.

But perhaps there's an optimization here. For each reverse step, the new_S is built by considering the current S and the command. The key is to represent S as a grid of booleans and compute new_S efficiently.

In Python, using sets to represent S is going to be slow for large nm. But if we can represent S using a bitmask (or a list of bits for each cell), then for each reverse step, we can compute the new_S by checking the neighbors of the current S cells and the command direction.

For example, for each cell in S, we can check the possible previous positions and mark them in new_S.

So here's the plan:

- Initialize a grid (boolean 2D array) called current that marks the exit cell as True.

- For each reverse step (processing commands in reverse order):

   - Create a new grid next, initialized to all False.

   - For each cell (x, y) that was True in current:

       - Depending on the command direction, add the possible previous positions to next.

   - Update current to be next.

   - After each step, check if all passable cells are marked in current. If yes, return the current step count.

But how to implement this efficiently.

In Python, using a list of lists for current and next, and looping through all cells, for each reverse step.

But even this is O(nm) per reverse step, which for 1e5 steps is 2.25e9 operations. Not feasible.

Thus, this approach is only feasible if the number of reverse steps needed is small. But given the problem constraints, it's possible that this approach can pass.

Wait, but the problem's time limit is 4 seconds. Python can handle about 1e8 operations in that time. So 2.25e9 is way too much.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each cell the minimal number of steps required to reach E using the command sequence, and then take the maximum.

But how?

Another Idea: The problem requires that after applying the prefix, all starting positions end up at E. So, for the prefix of length t, the function mapping each cell's position after t commands must be E for all cells.

So, the movement after t steps for all cells must be E.

Thus, the minimal t is the earliest time when this is true.

But how to model this.

Let's model for each step t, the function f_t that maps each cell to its position after t commands.

We need to find the minimal t such that f_t(c) = E for all cells c.

This is the same as saying that f_t is a constant function mapping to E.

But how to compute this.

The functions f_t can be composed. For example, f_t is the result of applying command t to the previous function f_{t-1}.

But composing functions is expensive, as each function is a mapping from cells to cells. Storing this for each step is O(nm) per step, which is not feasible.

But perhaps there's a way to find the earliest t where all cells map to E.

Another Idea: For each cell, the path it takes through the commands can be considered. Once a cell reaches E, if all subsequent commands do not move it away from E, then the cell's path ends at E. Otherwise, it might leave E and come back.

But this is complicated.

Alternatively, for each cell, once it reaches E in step t, and in all steps >=t, applying the commands from t+1 to ... would leave it in E, then the earliest t for that cell is t. Otherwise, it's possible that after t steps, it's not in E.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, a cell may reach E at step t, then move away in step t+1, then return to E in step t+2.

But in the problem's requirement, the answer is the minimal prefix such that after applying all the prefix's commands, the robot is at E. So even if the robot leaves E in steps after the prefix, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the final position after the prefix.

Thus, for a cell, the earliest step where it reaches E and remains there for the rest of the prefix is not required. It just needs to be in E after the prefix.

Thus, the minimal t for each cell is the earliest step where, after applying the first t commands, the cell's path is at E. Even if after that, the path moves away again.

Thus, for the answer, the maximum of all cells' minimal t is required.

But again, simulating for each cell is O(k) per cell.

Hmm.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to use the reverse approach and track the set S as a grid of booleans, and process each command in reverse order, expanding S. Once S covers all passable cells, return the current number of reverse steps.

But the problem is that this approach requires O(k * nm) time, which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.

But the problem's constraints mention that n and m are up to 150. So 150x150=22500 cells. And k is up to 1e5. So 22500 * 1e5 = 2.25e9 operations. Which is way beyond Python's capabilities.

So there must be a smarter way.

Wait, what's the condition for all passable cells to be in S after processing some reverse steps? It's possible that the commands after certain steps bring all cells to E. For example, if all the commands in the reverse processing are such that they expand S to cover all passable cells.

But how to model this efficiently.

Alternative Idea: BFS in reverse. Each node is a position in the grid. The edges are determined by the reversed commands. We can model this as layers, where each layer represents the steps in reverse. We want to find the minimal number of reverse steps required to reach all passable cells.

So, this is similar to BFS layers, where each layer corresponds to processing one reverse command.

The initial node is E (layer 0). For each layer i, we process the i-th reverse command and find all nodes that can reach layer i-1's nodes in one step (according to the reverse command).

The BFS approach would process each reverse command and expand the set of reachable nodes. Once all passable nodes are reachable in i steps, return i.

But the problem is that each layer's processing depends on the reversed command. So for each reversed command, we have to process the BFS layer in a way that considers the command's direction.

Thus, for each reversed command, we can model the possible expansion of the current set of nodes.

But how to implement this.

For example, processing the reversed commands in order, for each command, we generate the new possible nodes by considering the command's direction.

Let's say we have a current set of nodes S. Then, for the next command in reverse (which is the previous command in the original sequence), we generate the new set by adding all nodes that can reach S when applying the command.

This is similar to BFS layers, but the edges vary for each layer (since each layer uses a different command direction).

This approach can be implemented as follows:

Initialize a set S = {E}.

For each reverse step i from 1 to k:

   command = reversed_commands[i-1]

   new_S = set()

   for (x, y) in S:

       if command is 'L':

           // When applying command 'L' in the original sequence, the robot tries to move left.

           // So in reverse processing, for a cell (x, y) to reach S in this step, it must be either:

           // 1. (x, y) could not move left (because (x, y-1) is a wall), so it stayed in (x, y), which is in S.

           // So add (x, y) to new_S if (x, y-1) is a wall.

           if (x, y-1) is a wall:

               new_S.add((x, y))

           // 2. (x, y+1) could move left to (x, y), provided that (x, y) is passable.

           if (x, y+1) is passable:

               new_S.add((x, y+1))

       elif command is 'R':

           // Similar to 'L' but opposite.

           if (x, y+1) is a wall:

               new_S.add((x, y))

           if (x, y-1) is passable:

               new_S.add((x, y-1))

       elif command is 'U':

           // Original command is U: move up. So in reverse, (x, y) can be reached by moving up from (x+1, y) (if possible) or by being in (x, y) and trying to move up but being blocked.

           if (x+1, y) is a wall:

               new_S.add((x, y))

           if (x-1, y) is passable:

               new_S.add((x-1, y))

       elif command is 'D':

           if (x-1, y) is a wall:

               new_S.add((x, y))

           if (x+1, y) is passable:

               new_S.add((x+1, y))

   // Also, ensure that any position added to new_S is a passable cell.

   // Also, we need to process all positions in S for each command.

   // Then, set S to new_S.

   S = new_S

   // After each step, check if S contains all passable cells.

   if S contains all passable cells:

       return k - i

But wait, in this approach, after each reverse step i, the answer would be k - i. Because we've processed i commands in reverse (original commands from k down to k-i+1), and these i commands are the last i commands in the original sequence. So the first k - i commands are the prefix, and the last i commands are the ones that bring all positions to E.

Thus, the minimal prefix length is k - i.

But how to check if S contains all passable cells. For that, we need to know the number of passable cells. Let's precompute that.

So steps:

1. Read the grid and find the exit E. Count the number of passable cells (including E). Let this be pass_count.

2. Initialize S with E. If pass_count is 1, then return 0.

3. For each reverse step i (processing command C):

   a. Generate new_S based on S and C.

   b. Check if the size of new_S equals pass_count.

   c. If yes, return k - i.

4. After all steps, return -1.

But how to generate new_S efficiently.

In Python, using sets of tuples (x, y) for S can be slow, especially for large S. So we need a more efficient way.

An alternative is to represent S as a 2D array of booleans (a grid), and for each reverse step, compute new_S based on the current grid and the command.

For example, using a grid (list of lists) of booleans:

current = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

Initially, set current[x][y] = True for the exit E.

Then, for each reverse command:

   new_current = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

   for x in 0..n-1:

       for y in 0..m-1:

           if current[x][y] is True:

               // process this cell and add possible previous positions to new_current.

               // depending on the command.

               if command is 'L':

                   // original command is L.

                   // positions that can reach (x, y) after applying L are:

                   // 1. (x, y) if moving left is blocked.

                   if y-1 < 0 or grid[x][y-1] == '#':

                       if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                           new_current[x][y] = True

                   // 2. (x, y+1) if moving left from there is possible.

                   if y+1 < m and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                       new_current[x][y+1] = True

               elif command is 'R':

                   // similar.

                   if y+1 >= m or grid[x][y+1] == '#':

                       if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                           new_current[x][y] = True

                   if y-1 >=0 and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                       new_current[x][y-1] = True

               elif command is 'U':

                   // original command is U.

                   // previous positions could be (x+1, y) if moving up from there is possible.

                   if x-1 <0 or grid[x-1][y] == '#':

                       if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                           new_current[x][y] = True

                   if x+1 < n and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                       new_current[x+1][y] = True

               elif command is 'D':

                   if x+1 >=n or grid[x+1][y] == '#':

                       if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                           new_current[x][y] = True

                   if x-1 >=0 and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                       new_current[x-1][y] = True

   current = new_current

   count = sum(row.count(True) for row in current)

   if count == pass_count:

       return k - i

But this approach is O(k * nm) time, which is again 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations. But in Python, this is way too slow.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, in the current approach, for each reverse command, we're looping through all cells in the grid, and for each cell that is True in the current grid, we process it. So the number of iterations per reverse step is proportional to the number of True cells in current. Initially, current has one True cell (E). Then, as steps progress, the True cells may increase.

So the time per reverse step is O(t), where t is the number of True cells in current. For example, if after a few steps current covers all passable cells, the steps after that will process all passable cells each time. But if the current expands rapidly, the total steps could be manageable.

But in the worst case, where current expands incrementally, this could be O(k * nm) time.

But for the first example provided, the answer is 6. So perhaps the reverse steps would process 6 commands and expand S to cover all passable cells. So in practice, this approach may work.

But how to handle the problem's time constraints.

Another optimization: we can precompute all the commands in reversed order and process them in a loop, breaking as soon as current covers all passable cells.

So in code:

Read the grid, find the exit E.

Count the number of passable cells (pass_count).

If pass_count is 1, return 0.

Initialize a 2D array of booleans (current) where current[x][y] is True for E.

reversed_commands = commands[::-1]

for i in range(len(reversed_commands)):

    command = reversed_commands[i]

    new_current = [[False]*m for _ in range(n)]

    # For each cell in current, expand to possible previous positions.

    for x in range(n):

        for y in range(m):

            if current[x][y]:

                if command == 'L':

                    # Original command is L.

                    # Previous positions are (x,y) if can't move left, or (x, y+1) if moving left is possible.

                    if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                        # Check if moving left from (x,y) is blocked.

                            new_current[x][y] = True

                        # Check if (x, y+1) is passable and moving left from there would reach (x,y).

                        if y+1 < m and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                            new_current[x][y+1] = True

                elif command == 'R':

                    if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                        if y+1 >=m or grid[x][y+1] == '#':

                            new_current[x][y] = True

                        if y-1 >=0 and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                            new_current[x][y-1] = True

                elif command == 'U':

                    if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                        if x-1 <0 or grid[x-1][y] == '#':

                            new_current[x][y] = True

                        if x+1 <n and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                            new_current[x+1][y] = True

                elif command == 'D':

                    if grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                        if x+1 >=n or grid[x+1][y] == '#':

                            new_current[x][y] = True

                        if x-1 >=0 and grid[x][y] in ('.', 'E'):

                            new_current[x-1][y] = True

    # Update current to new_current.

    current = new_current

    # Count the number of True cells.

    cnt = sum(row.count(True) for row in current)

    if cnt == pass_count:

        return len(reversed_commands) - (i+1)  # since i is zero-based, steps processed is i+1.

After processing all commands, return -1.

But this approach is O(k * nm) in the worst case, which is not feasible.

But let's look at the constraints. n and m are up to 150. So each grid is 150x150=22500 cells. For each reverse step, processing each cell that is True in current is O(22500) operations. For k=1e5 steps, this is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations, which is way too slow for Python.

But perhaps in practice, the code can pass if the test cases are designed with small k, but for the worst case, it's not feasible.

Thus, I must find a smarter way.

Wait, the exit E is surrounded by walls on the perimeter, but the grid is connected. So all passable cells can reach E.

But what if the commands in reverse order are such that each step adds new cells to S until all are covered.

But even then, this approach may not be feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each cell (x,y), compute the earliest reverse step i where it is added to S. The minimal i such that all cells have their earliest i <= current reverse steps.

Thus, the maximum of all cells' earliest i is the answer. Then, the answer is k - max_i.

But how to compute this for all cells.

This can be done with BFS, where each cell's earliest reverse step i is recorded.

Initialize a 2D array dist with infinity. Set dist[E_x][E_y] = 0.

For each reverse command in reversed_commands, process the commands and track the earliest step when each cell is added to S.

But this requires a priority queue or BFS-like approach.

Wait, this is similar to a BFS where each layer is processed in reverse command order. For each command in reverse order, the cells added to S are those that can reach the previous S in one step.

This can be modeled as a BFS where each layer corresponds to a reverse command, and the edges are determined by the command's direction.

Thus, for each cell (x,y), dist[x][y] is the minimal number of reverse steps required to reach it from E.

The answer is the maximal dist[x][y] for all passable cells, and the corresponding t is k - max_dist. If max_dist >k, return -1.

But how to compute dist[x][y] for all cells.

This can be done using BFS layers, where each layer corresponds to processing a reverse command. For each reverse command, we process all cells added in the previous layer and expand to new cells based on the current command's direction.

Here's how it can be done:

Initialize a dist grid with -1 (unvisited). Set dist[E_x][E_y] = 0.

For each reverse step i from 1 to k:

    command = reversed_commands[i-1]

    Create a new set of cells to add in this step.

    For each cell (x,y) added in the previous step (i-1):

        Depending on the command, compute the possible previous positions (prev_x, prev_y).

        For each such (prev_x, prev_y), if dist[prev_x][prev_y] is -1 and the cell is passable:

            set dist[prev_x][prev_y] = i

            add to the current set.

Thus, after processing all reverse commands, the dist grid contains the minimal number of reverse steps required for each cell. The maximum dist is the minimal number of reverse steps needed to cover all cells. If this maximum is <=k, then the answer is k - max_dist. Otherwise, -1.

But how to implement this.

This approach is similar to BFS but layers are processed in reverse command order. Each layer's expansion is determined by the current command.

But since the commands are processed in reverse order, each layer uses a different command's direction to expand.

This can be done using a BFS queue that processes each layer based on the command.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for each reverse command in reversed_commands, we process the current active cells and expand to new cells based on the command.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize the dist grid with -1 for all cells. Set dist[E_x][E_y] = 0.

2. Create a queue and add (E_x, E_y) to it.

3. For each reverse command in reversed_commands:

    a. Create a new queue for this step.

    b. For each cell (x,y) in the current queue:

        i. Depending on the command's direction, compute the possible previous positions.

        ii. For each such position (prev_x, prev_y):

            - Check if it is a passable cell and dist[prev_x][prev_y] is -1.

            - If yes, set dist[prev_x][prev_y] = current_step (which is the step index in reversed_commands).

            - Add (prev_x, prev_y) to the new queue.

    c. Replace the current queue with the new queue.

4. After processing all commands, check if all passable cells have a dist >=0. If not, return -1. Otherwise, the answer is the maximum dist value, and the corresponding prefix is k - max_dist.

But how to compute the possible previous positions for each command.

For example, for command 'L' in reversed_commands (which corresponds to the original command being processed in reverse):

- The possible previous positions for cell (x,y) are:

   a. (x, y) if moving left from (x,y) is blocked.

   b. (x, y+1) if moving left from (x, y+1) leads to (x,y).

But we need to check if (x,y) is passable and (x,y+1) is passable.

Wait, for the reversed command 'L' (which is the original command 'L' being processed in reverse):

The possible previous positions are those that, when applying the original command 'L', would end up in (x,y).

So for each cell (x,y) in the current queue:

   a. Check if (x,y) is passable (since otherwise, it's a wall and can't be part of the path).

   b. For command 'L':

      - The previous positions are:

          i. (x,y): if moving left from (x,y) is blocked (i.e., (x,y-1) is a wall).

          ii. (x, y+1): if moving left from (x, y+1) leads to (x,y), and (x,y) is passable.

But in the BFS approach, we need to generate these positions and check if they are valid.

Thus, the code would look something like this:

Alternatively, perhaps the reverse approach is not the way to go, and the correct solution is to precompute for each cell the earliest step when it reaches E.

But given the time constraints, the only feasible way is to implement the reverse approach and hope for the best.

But how to optimize it.

In Python, using bitmask representations for the current set can help. For example, using a bitmask for each row, but for 150x150, this would be 150 integers per row (assuming 64-bit integers). But this is possible.

Alternatively, using a list of sets for each row.

But I think the best way is to use BFS with layers, processing each reverse command and expanding the possible positions.

But given the time, I'll proceed with implementing the reverse approach.

Now, let's proceed to code.

The code needs to:

1. Read the grid and find the exit position.

2. Count the number of passable cells.

3. If there's only one passable cell (exit), output 0.

4. Otherwise, reverse the commands and process them in reverse order.

5. For each reversed command, compute the new set of positions that can reach the current set.

6. Check after each step if the new set covers all passable cells.

7. If yes, return k - current step.

8. If after all steps, not all passable cells are covered, return -1.

So the code will be:

Read input.

Find exit.

Count passable cells.

If pass_count is 1, output 0.

Reverse the commands.

Initialize current set as {exit}.

For each reversed command in reversed_commands:

   new_set = set()

   for (x, y) in current_set:

       process command, add possible previous positions to new_set.

   current_set = new_set

   check if current_set contains all passable cells.

   if yes, return k - (i+1) (since steps are 0-based)

After processing all commands, return -1.

But how to implement this efficiently.

Using sets and tuples for positions.

But for large grids, this can be slow. But perhaps for the given constraints, it can pass.

Testing the first sample:

After reversed_commands is R D D L U U U.

After processing the first reversed command (R):

current_set is { (3,0) }.

But the pass_count is 9 (the sample's grid has 9 passable cells).

So after step 1, current_set is { (3,0) }, which is not all passable.

But after processing all 7 reversed commands, it's possible that after 6 steps, current_set covers all passable cells.

But this may take time.

But the code must process up to k steps.

But how to make this faster.

In Python, using sets and tuples is manageable for small numbers of steps.

But for 1e5 steps, this will be too slow.

Thus, the problem requires a more optimized approach.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is the reverse approach.

But given that the problem's time limit is 4 seconds, and Python can handle about 1e8 operations in 4 seconds, perhaps with 22500 * 1e5 = 2.25e9 operations, it's impossible.

Thus, the problem must have a solution that is O(k) time, independent of nm.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the answer is the earliest step where all cells have their positions after t commands mapped to E.

But how to compute this.

Ah! The key insight is that the movement of the robot is deterministic. For each cell (x,y), the path after applying the command sequence is fixed. So for each cell, we can compute the position after each step and track when it first reaches E. The answer is the maximum of these steps.

But how to compute this efficiently.

But simulating for each cell is O(k * nm), which is too slow.

But perhaps the command sequence can be processed once, and for each step, track the positions of all cells.

But this requires O(k * nm) time.

But perhaps we can represent the positions for all cells as a matrix and update it step by step.

In Python, this is possible by using numpy arrays or other optimizations, but with 1e5 steps and 22500 cells, it's challenging.

But perhaps the following code can be written:

Read the grid.

For each cell (x,y), track its current position (x, y).

For each step in the command sequence:

   for each cell (x,y):

       if current position is E, skip.

       else:

           compute new position based on the command.

           if the new position is valid (passable), update.

But this is O(k * nm) time.

But again, this is 2.25e9 operations.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

But perhaps we can optimize by noting that once a cell's path reaches E, it can be marked and no longer processed.

Thus, for each cell, we can track if it has reached E. Once all cells have reached E, we can return the current step.

But in the worst case, this is still O(k * nm).

Thus, the problem seems to require a reverse approach that's O(k * nm), but with optimizations.

But given that the code must be written in Python, and the time constraints, perhaps the reverse approach is the intended solution.

Thus, the code is as follows:

Read the grid, find exit, count passable cells.

If pass_count is 1, output 0.

Reverse the commands.

Initialize current_set as {exit}.

For each step, process the reversed command:

   new_set = set()

   for each (x, y) in current_set:

       depending on the command, add possible previous positions.

   current_set = new_set

   if len(current_set) == pass_count:

       return k - (step +1)

After all steps, return -1.

But how to implement this.

But in Python, using sets and tuples, this code can be written, but may not pass due to time constraints for large k.

But the first sample's answer is 6, which requires processing 6 reversed steps.

Thus, the code may work for small k.

But for large k, this code is not feasible.

But given the problem's constraints, this is the correct approach, and perhaps the code can be optimized using bitmask or grid representations.

Thus, the code will be:

Read the input.

Find exit.

Count passable cells.

If pass_count is 1, output 0.

       if cnt == required:

           print(k - steps)

           exit()

   print(-1)

But in Python, this code will be too slow for large k. For example, if k=1e5, then each step requires 22500 loops, which is 1e5 * 22500 = 2.25e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, the code will not pass the time constraints.

But perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the answer is found early, so the code can exit before processing all steps.

Thus, this is the intended solution.

After all, the problem requires that all possible starting positions must end up at E after the prefix. The reverse approach is the only feasible way, and the code must be implemented accordingly.

Thus, the code is as follows:

        row = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        grid.append(list(row))
