Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about a program with set and if-end blocks. Polycarp wants to make sure that the variable x is never set to s. To do that, he can either remove certain set instructions by paying their cost v. The goal is to find the minimum total cost required to prevent x from ever being s.

Hmm. The first thing I need to understand is how the program flows. The initial x is 0. Each set instruction can either be kept (so x is set to y) or removed (so x remains as it was). The if blocks are only executed if the current x is equal to y when the if is encountered. So the execution path depends on the current value of x and the set instructions that are active.

The challenge is to model all possible execution paths and ensure that no path leads to x being set to s. But considering that n can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to handle this. Brute-forcing all possibilities is impossible.

Let me think about the structure of the program. The if blocks form a hierarchy. Each if starts a block that ends with an end. These blocks can be nested. So the structure is like a tree, where each if is a node, and its children are the instructions inside the block until the corresponding end.

The key idea here is that the if blocks are conditional. The code inside an if block (including nested blocks) is only executed if the current x matches the if's y at the time the if is processed. But once inside, the code can change x, which might affect nested ifs.

But since we can choose to remove some set instructions, we have to decide for each set whether to remove it (cost v) or not. However, if a set is inside an if block that's not entered, then that set doesn't affect the flow.

So the problem is about ensuring that every possible set instruction that could set x to s (and is not removed) is made impossible to execute. That is, whenever a set y is not removed and y equals s, then the execution path leading to that set must not be possible.

Wait, no. The forbidden is that x is ever assigned to s. So any set instruction that is not removed and sets y = s must be avoided. So the presence of such a set in the code means that if the code path reaches that set, it's a problem. So to prevent x from being s, we must ensure that any such set is either removed or that the code path leading to it is impossible.

Alternatively, for each set instruction that has y = s, we must either remove it (pay v) or make sure that the code path leading to it is not possible.

So the problem is to model the possible code paths, and for each set instruction where y is s, either remove it or block all paths that reach it.

But how do the code paths work? The code paths are determined by the if conditions. For a set instruction to be executed, all the enclosing if blocks must have their conditions satisfied at the time they are encountered.

Wait, but the if conditions are evaluated at runtime. So when processing an 'if y', the current x determines whether the block is entered. But x can be modified by previous set instructions. So the execution path is dynamic. However, because we can choose to remove some sets, the execution paths are affected by which sets are removed.

This seems complicated. So maybe we need to model the possible states of x and see which paths can lead to a forbidden set. But with n up to 2e5, a BFS approach tracking x's state is impossible.

Another approach: since x can be modified by sets, and each set is either kept or removed, perhaps we can model the possible values of x at each point in the code and ensure that any set that would set x to s is either removed or the path to it is impossible.

But how?

Alternative idea: The program can be represented as a tree of nested if blocks. Each set instruction is in some nested structure of ifs. For a set to be executed, all the surrounding if conditions must have been true when their respective ifs were processed. But since the conditions are dynamic (depend on x's value at that moment), the path leading to a set instruction depends on the choices made (which sets are removed) and the sequence of x values.

Wait, but the problem requires that all possible paths (under the choices of which sets to remove) do not set x to s. So we have to choose a subset of set instructions to remove, such that in any possible execution path (determined by the kept sets and the if conditions' evaluations), x is never set to s.

So the minimal cost is the sum of the costs of the removed sets that are necessary to ensure that in all possible scenarios, x never becomes s.

This is a problem of blocking all possible paths that could lead to setting x to s.

Hmm. So for each set instruction that has y equal to s (call it a 'dangerous' set), we have two options: remove it (pay v) or ensure that the path leading to it is impossible.

But how do we model the path leading to it?

Wait, the path leading to a dangerous set is possible only if the surrounding if conditions, at the time they were processed, had their y equal to the current x. So for the dangerous set to be executed, all the enclosing if blocks must have their conditions met (based on the x's value at the time of the if check) which depends on the sets kept before that.

This seems very complex, but perhaps we can model the necessary conditions for a dangerous set to be executed.

Alternatively, think recursively. For each dangerous set, we can model the conditions under which it is reachable, and then find the minimal cost to either remove it or block all possible paths to it.

But this seems tricky. Let's think about the structure of the program.

The program is a sequence of instructions, with nested if blocks. The execution path is determined by the if conditions, which are checked in order. So, for each if block, the code inside is only executed if the current x (after processing all previous instructions) matches the if's y.

So the code inside an if block can only be entered if the x at that moment equals y. But once inside, x can be modified, which affects nested ifs.

So, the approach could be to model, for each instruction, the possible x values that could reach it, and ensure that any dangerous set (y = s) is either removed, or its path is impossible.

But how do we track possible x values efficiently?

Another Idea: The problem is similar to dynamic programming. We can process the instructions and track for each possible x value the minimal cost required to prevent s from being set. But given that x can be up to 2e5 and n is 2e5, this is not feasible.

Alternative Plan:

1. For each set instruction where y != s, leaving it as is is possible. For those where y == s, we must either remove them (cost v) or ensure that the code path leading to them is impossible.

2. The code path leading to a dangerous set (y = s) is determined by the surrounding if conditions. If all the if blocks enclosing the dangerous set have their conditions such that, when executed, x would not be in a state that allows entering all of them. For example, if the dangerous set is inside an if block that can only be entered when x is 5, but the code leading up to that if can't have x as 5, then the dangerous set is unreachable.

So, perhaps we can model for each dangerous set the set of constraints (the path leading to it) and see if there's a way to block that path by removing certain sets that affect the x values in those if conditions.

But this seems complicated.

Alternative Idea:

The minimal cost would be the sum of the costs of the dangerous sets that are not covered by their enclosing if conditions. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Suppose a dangerous set is inside an if block that requires x to be 3. If there's a way to make x never be 3 when that if is processed, then the dangerous set is unreachable, and we don't need to remove it.

So for each dangerous set, the options are:

- Remove it (cost v), or

- Ensure that in all possible execution paths, the code does not reach this set. That can be done by making sure that at least one of the enclosing if conditions is not satisfied.

But how to compute that?

Another way: For a dangerous set to be reachable, all the if conditions enclosing it must have their y equal to the current x at the time they were processed. So the path to the dangerous set is determined by the sequence of if conditions that must be satisfied. To prevent the dangerous set from being executed, either:

a) Remove the dangerous set, or

b) Ensure that at least one of the enclosing if conditions cannot be true when the code reaches that if statement.

So the problem reduces to, for each dangerous set, choose between paying its cost or modifying the code in such a way that one of the enclosing if conditions is impossible to be true. The minimal cost is the sum of the minimum between these options for all dangerous sets.

But how do we model the cost of making an if condition's path impossible?

Alternatively, for each if statement, if modifying the code such that the if's condition is never true (i.e., x != y when the if is processed), then all the code inside the if (including nested code) can be safely ignored. This could potentially cover multiple dangerous sets at once.

But how do we determine the minimal cost to block all dangerous sets, considering that blocking a higher-level if can prevent multiple dangerous sets inside it?

This seems similar to a problem where we can block certain paths by modifying the code higher up, which affects multiple dangerous sets. So perhaps the optimal solution is to model the hierarchy of if blocks and find for each dangerous set the minimal cost between removing it or blocking all possible paths leading to it.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Let me think of the code structure as a tree. Each if block is a node, and the parent nodes are the enclosing if blocks. The dangerous sets are leaves in this tree. For each dangerous set, the path from the root (the outermost if) to the set is a chain of if conditions that must all be true for the set to be executed.

So for each dangerous set, the minimal cost is the minimum between:

- Removing it (cost v)

OR

- Ensuring that at least one of the if conditions in its path is not met. How? By ensuring that when each if in the path is processed, x is not equal to y of that if. But x's value at those if points is determined by the sets that are executed before them. So, to block an if in the path, we can remove all sets that could set x to y for that if, and also prevent any path that could lead to x being y at that point.

Wait, but the initial x is 0. So for each if in the path of a dangerous set, we need to make sure that when that if is executed, x is not equal to the if's y. How can we do that?

For example, the if's y is 3. To block this if, we need to ensure that when processing the if statement, x is not 3. How can that be achieved?

Well, the x's value before the if is processed depends on the previous set instructions (which may have been removed or not). So to ensure that x is not equal to 3 at the if, all possible paths leading up to that if must have x !=3.

But how can we model that? It seems complicated.

Alternative Idea: For each if, compute the minimal cost to prevent that if from being entered. Then, for each dangerous set inside the subtree of that if, we can block them by paying the cost of blocking the if. So the problem becomes choosing for each dangerous set whether to remove it or to block one of the ifs in its path.

So this is similar to the classic problem where nodes have a cost, and we need to cover all dangerous sets by either paying their own cost or the cost of some ancestor. The minimal total cost is the sum of the selected nodes (either dangerous sets or their ancestors) such that every dangerous set is covered by at least one node in its path.

Wait, this seems promising. Let me rephrase:

Each dangerous set (with y = s) must be either:

- Removed (cost v), or

- Blocked by ensuring that one of its ancestor if blocks is not entered. To block the if block, the if's y must not be equal to x when processed. So, the minimal cost to block the if is the cost to prevent x from being equal to y at that if.

But how do we compute that cost? Because the x at that if is determined by the code before the if. So, the code leading up to the if may set x to y via some set instructions, and we need to prevent that.

So, for an if with y = Y, the cost to block it is the minimal cost of removing all set instructions that set x to Y in the code that is executed before reaching the if. Because if any of those sets are kept, then x could be Y when the if is processed, leading to the block being entered.

Alternatively, if there is at least one set before the if that could set x to Y (and is kept), then x can be Y at the if. So to block the if, we have to remove all such sets. The cost is the sum of the v's of those sets.

But wait, maybe there are multiple paths. For example, if before the if there are multiple set instructions that could set x to Y, but some are inside if blocks that may not be entered. So the code could reach the if with x=Y via multiple paths.

So, to ensure that the if is never entered, we must make sure that in all possible code paths leading up to the if, x is not equal to Y. Which would require that all possible sets that could set x to Y before the if are removed.

Thus, the cost to block an if is the sum of the minimal costs required to remove all possible sets that can set x to Y before the if.

But this seems complicated. Let's take an example.

Suppose before the if (Y=3), there is a set 3 5 (cost 5) in the main code, and another set 3 10 inside an if block that checks if x is 2. So, if x is 2, then the code enters that if and sets x to 3. Otherwise, it skips. So, to ensure that when the if Y=3 is processed, x is not 3, we need to remove the first set (cost 5) and also remove the set inside the if (cost 10). Because even if the first set is removed, the second set can be executed if the code enters that if block. So, the cost to block the if Y=3 would be 5 + 10 =15.

But that's not necessarily the case. Because the code path that enters the inner if (Y=2) and executes the set 3 10 depends on x being 2. So, if there are other sets before the inner if that set x to 2 (and are not removed), then the inner if could be entered. But if we remove those sets, then the inner if's set 3 10 is not executed.

This seems very complex. So, the cost to block an if Y=3 depends on all possible code paths that could set x to Y before the if. To block all such possibilities, we need to remove all sets that could set x to Y in any code path before the if.

But how can we track that efficiently?

Alternative Idea: For each if statement, the minimal cost to block it (i.e., ensure x != Y when it is processed) is the sum of the minimal costs required to remove all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code that can be executed before the if.

But how to find all such sets?

Perhaps we can model for each if, the set of all possible code paths that reach it, and collect all set instructions that could set x to Y in those paths. But with n up to 2e5, this is impossible.

Another Idea: For each position in the code, track the possible values of x that can reach it. But this is again impossible for large n and x values.

Alternative Plan:

The problem can be approached by considering the hierarchical structure of the if blocks and tracking for each level the possible x values that can reach it. However, given the time constraints, this might not be feasible.

Alternative Approach:

We can model the problem as a tree where each node represents an if block and its corresponding end. The dangerous sets are the leaves that set y = s. For each such set, we can choose to either remove it (cost v) or ensure that none of the paths leading to it are possible. The latter can be achieved by blocking at least one if in the path from the root (the outermost if) to the dangerous set. Blocking an if means ensuring that when it is processed, x is not equal to its y. To compute the minimal cost for blocking an if, we need to find the sum of the costs of all set instructions in the code before the if that set y to the if's y. Because any such set that is kept allows x to be set to the if's y, leading to entering the block.

Wait, but how can x be set to the if's y before the if is processed? For example, if there's a set instruction before the if with y = Y, and that set is not removed, then x can be Y when the if is processed. So to block the if, we need to remove all such sets. Thus, the cost to block the if is the sum of the v's of all set instructions with y=Y that are executed before the if.

But how do we collect all such set instructions?

This is the crux of the problem. For each if statement, we need to know all set instructions that can potentially set x to Y (the if's y) and are in the code that is executed before the if (but not inside any if block that is not entered). But since the code is structured with nested if blocks, perhaps we can track for each if block the set of sets that are in the same scope or outer scopes.

So, for example, the code before the if (but in the same or outer blocks) can contribute set instructions that are executed before the if. Sets inside if blocks that are not entered would not be executed.

But this seems difficult to track. However, perhaps we can model the code as a stack of active if blocks. For each if, when we enter it, we push it onto the stack, and when we exit (end), we pop. Then, for any set instruction, the current stack represents the path of if blocks that must be entered for this set to be executed.

So, the idea is:

- Each set instruction is in the context of a stack of active if blocks. For example, a set inside two nested ifs is only executed if both if conditions are satisfied.

But how can we track which set instructions can be executed before a particular if block? That's not directly possible, as the if blocks can be nested and their conditions depend on previous sets.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of each set instruction that sets y to a particular value as contributing to the possibility of x being that value. For each if block with y=Y, the minimal cost to block it is the sum of the costs of all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code paths that could execute before the if. If we can find that, then for each dangerous set, the minimal cost is min(its own cost, the minimal cost to block any of its ancestor if blocks).

But how do we compute, for each if, the sum of the costs of all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code paths before the if and can set x to Y.

Alternatively, maybe for each if block, the set instructions that can affect x when entering the if are those in the same scope and outer scopes. So, for example, the if is in the main code (no enclosing if), then all set instructions before it in the main code can affect x. If the if is inside another if block, then the set instructions before it in that block (and outer blocks) can affect x.

But this approach ignores the nested conditions. For example, a set inside an if block that is not entered would not affect x. So, the problem is that the code paths leading to the if are dynamic, and the set instructions that are executed depend on the previous if conditions.

But perhaps the key insight is that the if blocks are processed in a hierarchical way. For a set instruction to be executed before a certain if, it must be in an outer block or in the same block as the if and appear before it. But whether the set is executed depends on the if conditions of the blocks that contain it.

But this seems too vague. Let's look for a way to model the problem that can be implemented efficiently.

Alternative Plan:

1. For each dangerous set (y = s), we have two options: remove it (cost v) or block all possible paths leading to it. Blocking the paths can be done by blocking any if in its ancestor chain (so that the code path cannot reach the set). The cost to block an if is the sum of all set instructions with y equal to the if's y that are in the code before the if and can be executed in some path leading to the if. 

But how to compute that sum?

Wait, perhaps the cost to block an if with y=Y is the sum of the costs of all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code before the if and are not inside any if blocks. Or, more accurately, that are in the code that is always executed before the if, regardless of the if conditions. But this is not the case. For example, a set inside an if block that is before the if in question may or may not be executed.

Alternatively, the cost to block an if with y=Y is the sum of all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code paths that could lead to the if. For each such set, if it's not removed, then x could be Y when the if is processed. So to block the if, all such sets must be removed.

But how to find these sets?

Maybe the code is processed as a stack of if blocks. Each set instruction is recorded with the stack state (the current path of if blocks) when it is encountered. Then, for a given if, any set instruction that appears before it and is in a code path that can be executed (i.e., in the same scope or outer scopes) would contribute to the possible x values.

But this approach is not feasible for large n.

Alternative Idea: Let's precompute for each if block the list of set instructions with y equal to the if's y that are in the code paths that could be executed before the if. Then, the cost to block the if is the sum of the costs of those sets. Then, for each dangerous set, we can compare the cost of removing it versus the minimal cost of blocking any of its ancestor ifs.

But how to compute that list?

An alternative approach is to realize that during the code's execution, the x value can be modified by any set instructions that are not removed, and the if conditions are checked based on the current x.

But considering that the problem requires that x is never set to s, perhaps the key is to track the possible x values and see how they can reach dangerous sets.

But this seems unmanageable for large n.

Another Idea: The problem can be viewed as a tree of possible code paths, where each node represents a set or if instruction, and edges represent transitions. But given the constraints, building such a tree is not feasible.

Alternative Plan:

We need to find all dangerous set instructions (y = s) and for each, decide whether to remove it or block all paths leading to it.

But blocking a path can be done by ensuring that for some if in the path, the code doesn't enter that if block. For that, we need to ensure that when the if is processed, x is not equal to the if's y. So for each such if, we need to remove all set instructions with y = if's y that are in the code executed before the if.

Thus, the minimal cost is the sum for all dangerous sets of the minimum between:

- The cost to remove the set.

- The minimal cost among the costs to block any of the ifs in its path (i.e., the sum of all sets with y equal to the if's y that are in the code before the if and can be executed in some path leading to the if).

But again, the problem is to efficiently compute the sum of such sets for each if.

Let's think of the code as a list of instructions. For each if instruction, the code before it (i.e., all previous instructions that are not inside a deeper block) can have sets that could set x to the if's y. So, for each if instruction, the sum of the costs of all set instructions with y = Y (the if's y) that are in the code before the if and not inside any unclosed if blocks.

But how do we track this?

Possible Approach:

We can maintain a stack that represents the current nesting of if blocks. For each set instruction, when we process it, we can record the current stack (the path of if blocks that must be entered for this set to be executed). Then, for each if instruction, we can collect all set instructions with y = Y (the if's y) that are in the code before it and whose stack is a prefix of the stack of the if. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, for each if, all set instructions that are not inside any if blocks that come after it. No, that's not correct.

Alternative Idea: The code is processed in a linear order. For each if, the sets that are before it in the code and not inside a deeper block (i.e., in the same or outer blocks) would be executed if their enclosing if conditions are met. So, for example, if we have a set instruction in the main code before the if, then it's executed unconditionally (unless it's inside an if block that is not entered). So, for each if, the sets before it in the code that are in the same or outer blocks and have y = Y (the if's y) contribute to the possible x value when the if is processed.

Thus, the sum of the costs of those sets is the cost to block the if. Because if any of those sets is kept, then x could be Y when the if is processed, leading to entering the block.

So, to block the if, we must remove all such sets. So the cost is the sum of their v's.

But how to compute this for each if?

We can process the code and keep track of the current stack of active if blocks (each time we encounter an if, push it to the stack; when we encounter end, pop). Then, for each set instruction with y=Y, we can record it in a list associated with Y. Then, for each if instruction with y=Y, the cost to block it is the sum of all set instructions in the same or outer blocks (i.e., those sets that are in the code before the if and are in the same or outer blocks) with y=Y.

Wait, but the same or outer blocks would mean that the set is in the same level of nesting or higher. For example, if the if is inside a block, then any set in the same block (before the if) or in the parent block (before the if's block) would contribute.

But how to track that. Maybe for each if, the stack depth is the number of active if blocks when the if is processed. Then, any set instruction with stack depth less than or equal to the if's stack depth and appearing before it would be in the same or outer blocks.

No, because the stack depth can vary. For example, a set instruction can be in an if block that is deeper than the current if's stack depth, but that if block was closed before the current if is processed.

So, perhaps we can model the stack of if blocks as a series of nested scopes. For each if, we can record the indices of the scopes it is in. Then, for a set to be in the same or outer scopes as an if, it must be in a scope that is an ancestor of the if's scope.

But how to track this. Let's think of the code as a sequence of nested scopes. Each if block starts a new scope. For example:

Main scope (scope 0)
  set1
  if1 -> scope1
    set2
    if2 -> scope2
      set3
    end
    set4
  end
  if3 -> scope3
    set5
  end

In this example, the scopes are 0 (main), 1 (if1), 2 (if2), 3 (if3).

For each instruction, we can track which scopes it is in. For example, set1 is in scope 0. set2 is in scope 1. set3 is in scope 2. set4 is in scope 1. set5 is in scope3.

An if's scope is determined by the stack when it is processed. So, when processing an if, we push its scope onto the stack, and when processing an end, we pop.

Thus, for any instruction, the current stack (list of scopes) represents the path of nested if blocks that must be entered for the instruction to be executed.

Now, for an if instruction with y=Y, the sets that can affect x when it is processed are those sets that are in scopes that are prefixes of the if's scope stack. For example, the if in scope3 (stack [0,3]) can be affected by sets in scope0 or scope3 (before the if). Sets in scope1 or scope2 are in different branches and are not executed when processing if3.

Wait, no. Because if3 is in the main scope (after the end of if1's block). So, the stack when processing if3 is [0]. The set5 is in scope3 (stack [0,3]). But to reach if3, the code is in the main scope (stack [0]). So, any set in the main scope before if3 would be executed. For example, set1 is in scope0 and before if3, so it's executed. set4 is in scope1, but the code after end (which ends scope1) comes before if3. So, set4 is after the end of scope1 and is in scope0.

So, the scopes are not nested in the code structure, but in the execution path. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternative Idea: For each if instruction, the path of scopes leading to it is the sequence of if blocks that are open when the if is processed. For example, the main scope is always open. When we process an if, a new scope is created. When we process an end, the innermost scope is closed.

Thus, for each if, the scopes are those that are active at the time the if is processed. For example, in the code:

if0 (scope0)
  set1 (scope0)
  if1 (scope1)
    set2 (scope1)
  end
  if2 (scope2)
    set3 (scope2)
  end
end

Here, when processing if1, the active scopes are [0]. When processing if2, the active scopes are [0] again. So, the scopes for if1 and if2 are 1 and 2, but their parent is 0.

So, for each if, the path of scopes is determined by the stack at the time it is processed. So, for each if, we can record the list of scopes (the path) leading to it. Similarly, for each set instruction, the scopes path is recorded.

Thus, for an if with y=Y, the set instructions that can affect x when processing the if are those set instructions that are:

- Before the if in the code.

- In scopes that are prefixes of the if's scope path.

For example, if the if's scope path is [0,1,2], then any set in scope paths [0], [0,1], or [0,1,2] and appearing before the if would be considered.

But this is not correct. Because the code path leading to the if may not have entered those scopes. For example, a set instruction inside a different if block would not be executed.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the code structure as a tree, where each node is an if block, and the children are the instructions inside the block. The root is the main program. So, the code is a tree where each if is a node, and its children are the instructions (including other ifs) inside the block. The end instructions mark the end of the block.

Thus, the code is a tree. The dangerous sets are leaves in this tree. For each dangerous set, the path from the root to the set is the sequence of if blocks that must be entered for the set to be executed.

Thus, for each dangerous set, the minimal cost is either removing it (cost v) or the sum of the costs to block each if in its path (the sum of the costs to block that if, which is the sum of all sets with y equal to the if's y that are in the path up to that if).

But how to compute this sum for each if?

An alternative approach inspired by the problem's structure:

We can model the code as a tree of if blocks. For each if block, we track the minimal cost to block it, which is the sum of all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the same or ancestor blocks and are executed before the if. Then, for each dangerous set, the minimal cost is min(its own v, the minimal cost of blocking any if in its path).

The total minimal cost is the sum of these min values for all dangerous sets.

So, the steps are:

1. Parse the code into a tree structure, tracking the hierarchy of if blocks.

2. For each if block, compute the sum of set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that appear before the if in the code and are in the same or ancestor blocks. This sum is the cost to block the if.

3. For each dangerous set (y = s), collect all if blocks in its path (from root to the set's parent if block) and calculate the minimal cost between removing the set (cost v) or the minimal cost among the sum of blocking any if in the path.

The key challenge is efficiently computing the sum of sets with y=Y for each if block.

But how?

Maybe for each if block, during the parsing phase, we can track the sum of set instructions with y=Y that are in the code up to that if. For example, as we process each set instruction, we can maintain a dictionary that maps y values to the sum of their v's, but this sum is only for sets in the current active blocks (i.e., the stack of if blocks that are open).

Wait, perhaps during the parsing of the code, we can track for each y the sum of the v's of set instructions that are in the code path that could be executed. For example, when processing a set instruction, if it's inside a series of if blocks, the sum for y would be added to the current y's total. But if those if blocks are not entered, the set instruction is not executed. However, in our problem, we need to consider all possible paths. So, for a set instruction to affect an if block, it must be in a code path that can be executed before the if.

But given that the code is static, the set instructions that can be executed before an if are those that are in the same or outer blocks and appear before the if in the code.

Thus, for each if block, the sum of set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code before the if and not inside any deeper blocks. Because those sets could have been executed, leading x to Y when the if is processed.

So, during parsing, we can track the current path of if blocks (the stack). For each if block, when we process it, we can look at all set instructions with y=Y (its y) that are before it in the code and have a stack that is a prefix of the current stack. But this seems challenging.

Alternative Idea: For each y, maintain a list of the sum of v's for each position in the code. But this might not be feasible.

Alternative Plan:

We can process the code in a linear fashion, maintaining a stack of if blocks. For each set instruction, we record its y and v. For each if instruction, when encountered, we need to calculate the sum of all set instructions before it (in the code) that have y equal to the if's Y and are in the same or outer blocks. 

To do this, for each if instruction, we can collect the sum of all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code before it and are in the same or outer blocks (i.e., their stack is a subset of the current stack up to that point).

But how to track this.

Here's a possible way:

1. Process the code in order, maintaining a stack of active if blocks. Each time an if is encountered, push it onto the stack. Each end encountered pops the stack.

2. For each if instruction, when processing it, record the current stack depth (number of active if blocks). Also, note the y of the if.

3. For each set instruction, when processing it, record the current stack depth and the current stack (the list of if blocks active at the time). Then, for any subsequent if instruction, the sum of all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are before it in the code, and whose stack is a prefix of the if's stack.

Alternatively, for each if with y=Y, the sum is the sum of all set instructions before it in the code that have y=Y and are in the same or outer scopes. 

But how to model this.

Perhaps, for each if instruction, the sum of set y=Y before it can be computed by maintaining a dictionary that tracks, for each y, the sum of v's of set instructions in each scope level. For example, for each y, we can have an array where the index is the scope level (stack depth), and the value is the sum of v's for set instructions with y=y at that scope level. 

But this may not capture the nested structure correctly.

Alternative Idea: For each y, track the sum of v's of set instructions with y=y in the current active scopes. Each time an if is processed, record the current sum for y=Y (the if's y), which represents the total cost of sets that could set x to Y before this if. Then, the cost to block this if is this sum.

Yes! Here's how this works:

- As we parse the code, we maintain a dictionary `current_sum` which maps y values to the sum of v's of all set instructions with y=y that are in the current active scopes (i.e., in the path of the current stack).

- When processing a set instruction, if we decide to keep it (i.e., not remove it), then it contributes to the current_sum. So, for a set instruction with y and v, we add v to current_sum[y]. But since the set instruction is inside some if blocks, whether it's executed depends on the if conditions. However, in our problem, we are considering the scenario where we want to block the if by removing all sets that could set x to Y before it. So, any set instruction that is in the code before the if and could be executed in some path leading to the if (i.e., in the same or outer scopes) must be considered.

Thus, when processing a set instruction, regardless of the current stack (active if blocks), we add its v to the current_sum[y]. Then, when we encounter an if instruction with y=Y, the current_sum[Y] is the total cost of all sets before this if that could set x to Y. So, the cost to block this if is current_sum[Y].

But this isn't correct because the set could be inside an if block that's not entered. For example, a set instruction is inside an if block with y=5. If the code path does not enter that if block, then the set is not executed. However, in this model, we're adding the set's v to current_sum[Y] regardless of the if conditions. So the current_sum[Y] would include all sets before the current if, regardless of their enclosing if blocks.

This approach overcounts the sets. For example, a set inside an if block that is not entered would not contribute to x's value. But according to this model, it's counted, which would lead to a higher cost than necessary.

Thus, this approach is not correct.

Alternative Idea: The sum for an if's Y should include all set instructions with y=Y that are in the code before the if and in the same or outer blocks, and are not inside any if blocks that are not part of the path to the if.

But how to model this.

Wait, but the code is static. The if blocks are nested. So, for a set instruction that is in the code before the if and in the same or outer blocks, it can be executed if the enclosing if conditions are met. However, whether those if conditions are met depends on the previous set instructions. So, the code paths are dynamic.

This seems impossible to model efficiently. So perhaps the key insight is that for the purposes of blocking an if, we need to consider all possible sets that could possibly set x to Y before the if. The minimal cost to block the if is the sum of the v's of those sets. Because if any of those sets are not removed, then x could be Y when the if is processed, leading to the block being entered.

Thus, the cost to block an if with Y is the sum of all set instructions with y=Y that appear before the if in the code and are in the same or outer blocks (i.e., their stack is a prefix of the if's stack).

So, during parsing, for each if, we need to know the sum of all sets with y=Y that are in the code before it and are in the same or outer blocks.

To compute this, we can use a stack and for each set instruction, track the path of if blocks it is in. Then, for each if instruction, the sum is the sum of all sets with y=Y whose path is a prefix of the if's path.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Here's a possible approach:

- As we process the code, we maintain a stack representing the current path of if blocks.

- For each set instruction, when processed, we store its y, v, and the current stack (the list of if blocks' y values leading to this set).

- For each if instruction, when processed, we store its y and the current stack.

Then, for each if, the cost to block it is the sum of all sets before it in the code that have y = if's y and whose stack is a prefix of the if's stack.

But with n up to 2e5, checking all previous sets for each if is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Thus, we need a way to efficiently compute this sum.

Alternative Idea: For each possible stack prefix, we can track the sum of sets with y=Y. For example, for each stack state s, and for each y, maintain a map that stores the sum of sets with y=y and stack prefix s. Then, for an if with stack s, the sum would be the sum for y=Y and all prefixes of s.

But this is also not feasible for large stack sizes.

Alternative Idea: The stack can be represented by a unique identifier. For example, each time a new if is pushed onto the stack, a new identifier is generated. But this doesn't help with the prefix check.

Another Idea: Since the code is a well-formed nested structure, the stack is a sequence of if blocks that are opened and closed. For each set instruction, the stack when it is processed is a list of if blocks that are active. For an if instruction, the sum of sets with y=Y and stack prefix s, where s is the stack of the if up to any point.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Plan:

We can precompute for each if instruction the sum of all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code before it and are in the same or outer blocks. 

To compute this efficiently, we can process the code and track the current path (stack) of if blocks. For each set instruction, we can note the current stack. For each if, when processing it, the stack represents the path to it. The sum of all sets with y=Y that have a stack which is a prefix of the if's stack.

This can be represented using a trie-like structure where each node represents a stack state, and for each node, we track the sum of sets for each y. When processing an if, we look up all nodes in the trie that are prefixes of the current stack and sum the values for y=Y.

But this is complex and may not be feasible to implement within the time constraints.

Final Idea:

The problem requires that we find for each dangerous set the minimal cost between removing it or blocking one of the if blocks in its path. To block an if, we need to remove all sets with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code before it and can be executed in some path leading to the if.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to realize that for each dangerous set, the minimal cost is the minimum between its own v and the minimal cost of blocking any of the if blocks in its path.

The cost to block an if is the sum of all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code before the if and are not inside any if blocks. Because those sets are executed unconditionally and thus would set x to Y, leading to the if being entered.

But this is not correct. For example, a set inside an if block that is before the if in the code would not be executed unless the enclosing if's condition is met. But since the code is static, the presence of such a set in a different if block may not affect the if in question.

Wait, but for the code:

set 3 5 (cost 5)
if 3
  set 3 10 (cost 10)
end
if 3
  set 1 100 (dangerous if s=1)
end

In this case, the second if block has Y=3. The sets that can set x to 3 before the second if are the first set (cost 5) and the set inside the first if block (cost 10). But the set inside the first if is only executed if the first if's condition is met (x=3). But if the first set is kept, then x=3 when the first if is processed, so the set inside is executed, setting x to 3 again. So, the second if is processed with x=3, leading to entering the block.

Thus, to block the second if, we need to remove both the first set (cost5) and the set inside the first if (cost10), because otherwise, the first set is kept and allows x to be 3 when the first if is processed, leading to the set inside being executed. But this seems to require considering all possible paths, which is not feasible.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:

- Each dangerous set must be removed or have all paths to it blocked.

- For each dangerous set, the minimal cost is the minimum between its v and the minimal cost of blocking any if in its path.

- Blocking an if requires removing all set instructions with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the code before the if and are not inside any if blocks (i.e., in the main code).

This is incorrect, but perhaps it's the only way to proceed given time constraints.

But according to the first sample input:

Sample 1:

5 1

set 1 10 (dangerous, y=1, s=1)
set 2 15 (non-dangerous)
if 2 (y=2)
set 1 7 (dangerous)
end

The dangerous sets are the first and third instructions.

The correct output is 17, which is 10+7.

But according to the options:

For the first dangerous set (y=1), the only option is to remove it (cost 10), since it's in the main code. The third instruction is inside an if block (y=2). To block the if, we need to remove all sets with y=2 before the if. The only set before the if with y=2 is the second set (v=15). So the cost to block the if would be 15. But the third set's cost is 7. So the minimal cost for the third set is min(7, 15) =7. Total 10+7=17, which matches the sample.

So, this approach works for the first sample.

But according to the model where blocking an if requires removing all sets with y=Y in the code before it and not inside any if blocks, this seems to work. But what about sets inside if blocks?

In the first sample, the third dangerous set is inside an if block that is entered only if x=2. The set before the if (y=2, v=15) is in the main code, so to block the if, we remove it. Thus, x would be 0 (since the first set is removed) before the if. Then, x=0 !=2, so the if is not entered, and the third dangerous set is not executed. Thus, blocking the if by removing the second set (cost15) would save the third set's cost (7), but since the third set's cost is cheaper, it's better to remove the third set.

So, the model where the cost to block an if is the sum of sets with y=Y in the main code before the if seems to work for this sample.

But this is not the case in other examples.

Sample 3:

9 200

if 0
set 5 5
if 5
set 100 13
end
if 100
set 200 1 (dangerous)
end
end

Output is 1.

The dangerous set is inside a nested if structure. The path to it is:

if0 (y=0) → if5 (y=5) → if100 (y=100) → dangerous set.

To block this set, the minimal cost is to remove it (cost1). Alternatively, block any of the ifs in the path.

For example, blocking if0 would require removing all sets with y=0 before it. But there are no such sets. So the cost to block if0 is 0. So the dangerous set's cost is min(1, 0) → 0. But the sample output is 1.

Wait, this suggests that the model is incorrect. Because according to the sample, the correct answer is to remove the dangerous set. But according to the model, blocking if0 would cost 0 (since no sets with y=0 before it), and thus the dangerous set's cost would be 0. But the sample output is 1.

This indicates that the model is incorrect.

So, this suggests that the previous approach is not correct. Thus, there's a flaw in the model.

Thus, the model must be incorrect, and we need to rethink.

So, what's wrong with the model?

In sample3, the dangerous set is inside if0, if5, if100. To block any of these ifs:

- Block if0: requires that x !=0 when processing if0. Since the initial x is 0, if there are no sets before if0 that set x to 0, then x is 0, and the if is entered. So to block if0, the initial x is 0, which equals y=0. Thus, the if is entered. So the cost to block if0 is the sum of all sets with y=0 before it. But there are no such sets. So cost is 0. But this is impossible, because x is 0 at that point. Thus, the if is entered, and the code inside is executed.

Thus, the model's assumption that blocking an if by removing all sets with y=Y before it is not sufficient. Because the initial x is 0, and if the if's y is 0, then the if is entered unless there are sets before it that change x. But if there are no sets before the if, then x is 0, and the if is entered.

Thus, the model is incorrect. The cost to block an if with y=Y is not just the sum of sets before it with y=Y. Because even if there are no sets, x could be Y at the time of the if.

Thus, the initial x is 0. So for an if with y=0, even if there are no sets before it, the if is entered. So to block such an if, we must have at least one set before it that changes x from 0 to something else. Or, all possible paths leading to the if must have x != Y.

Thus, the problem is more complex than previously modeled.

Thus, the previous approach is incorrect. So, how to proceed?

Alternative Idea: For an if with y=Y, the cost to block it is the sum of all set instructions before it that can set x to Y, plus the initial x (0) if Y is 0. Because if Y is 0 and there are no sets before the if, then x is 0, and the if is entered.

Thus, for an if with y=Y:

If Y == 0, then to block the if, we need to have at least one set before it that changes x from 0. Otherwise, even if there are no sets, the if is entered.

Thus, the cost to block such an if is the sum of all sets before it with y=Y (including Y=0), plus (if Y=0) check if the initial x is 0. But this complicates things.

But how can we model the initial x?

The initial x is 0. Thus, for any if with y=0, unless there is a set before it that sets x to a value different from 0, the if will be entered.

Thus, to block such an if, we need to remove all sets before it that set x to 0 (so that x remains 0), but also ensure that there is at least one set before it that sets x to something else. Or not. This is getting very complicated.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is to track for each if the possible values of x when it is processed. But with large n and x values, this is impossible.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is to model the code using a dynamic programming approach, where for each instruction, we track the possible x values and the minimal cost to reach that state without having x=s.

But given the time and memory constraints, this is not feasible for large n.

Thus, the problem requires a different insight.

Let's consider that the forbidden value is s. Our goal is to prevent x from ever being s.

So, we need to ensure that every set instruction that sets y=s is either removed or is in a code path that is never executed.

To prevent the code path from being executed, all if blocks enclosing the dangerous set must have at least one if that is not entered.

Thus, for each dangerous set, we can choose to either:

- Remove it (cost v), or

- Ensure that at least one of the if blocks in its path is not entered.

To ensure that an if is not entered, we must make sure that when that if is processed, x is not equal to its y. This can be done by removing all set instructions that set x to that if's y, and are in the code before that if and can be executed in some path leading to that if.

But again, this is difficult to track.

Alternative Idea:

Each if block's execution depends on the x value at the time of processing. Thus, for each if block, the code inside is executed only if x equals the if's y. To prevent a dangerous set from being executed, we must either remove it or ensure that at least one of the enclosing if blocks is not entered.

The minimal cost for each dangerous set is the minimum between removing it or the minimal cost of blocking any if in its path.

The cost to block an if is the sum of the costs of all set instructions that can set x to the if's y before that if, plus any necessary costs to ensure that x is not equal to the if's y at that point.

But again, this seems unmanageable.

Perhaps the correct approach is to model the code as a tree and for each dangerous set, compute the minimal cost to block it by considering all if blocks in its path. For each if block in the path, the cost to block it is the sum of all sets with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the path leading to the if. 

But how to compute this sum.

Perhaps during parsing, we can track for each y the cumulative sum of set instructions that set y and are not inside any if block. But this is not correct.

Alternatively, for each if block, we can track the sum of sets with y=Y (the if's y) that are in the same or outer blocks and are before the if.

For example, during parsing, maintain a stack of if blocks. For each if block, when processed, record its y and the current sum of sets for y=Y in the code before it and in the same or outer blocks. This sum is the cost to block the if.

Thus, for each if block, the cost to block it is the sum of all sets with y=Y that are before it in the code and in the same or outer blocks.

This can be computed by maintaining a global dictionary that maps y values to the sum of v's of sets encountered so far in the current stack. When processing a set, add its v to the global sum for its y. When entering an if block, push the current sum for y=Y and reset the global sum for y=Y. When exiting the if block (end), pop the previous sum.

Wait, this might work.

Here's the idea:

- Use a stack to track the current if blocks. Each stack entry contains a dictionary that keeps track of the sum of v's for each y in the current scope.

- When processing a set instruction, add its v to the current sum (the top of the stack) for y.

- When processing an if instruction, push a new dictionary onto the stack. This new dictionary is initialized with the current sum for y=Y (the if's y) from the previous scope. This represents the sum of all sets with y=Y in outer scopes.

- When processing an end instruction, pop the top of the stack.

This way, for each if instruction, when it is processed, the sum from the previous scope (outer blocks) is stored in the new dictionary. This sum represents the total cost of all sets with y=Y in the outer blocks before the if.

Thus, the cost to block the if is the sum stored in the new dictionary when it is processed. This sum includes all sets with y=Y in the outer blocks before the if, but not those inside deeper blocks.

For example, consider the following code:

set 3 5 (y=3, v=5) → in the main scope.

if 3 (y=3) → push a new scope. The sum for y=3 is 5 (from the main scope).

Inside this if:

set 3 10 → add 10 to the current scope's sum for y=3.

end → pop the scope.

Another if 3 → push a new scope. The sum for y=3 is 5 (from the main scope) plus any sets in outer scopes before the if.

Thus, the cost to block the second if is 5.

This approach correctly captures the sum of sets with y=Y in the outer scopes before the if.

Thus, during parsing, for each if instruction, we can record the sum of sets with y=Y in the outer scopes before it. This sum is the cost to block the if.

Now, for each dangerous set, we can compute the minimal cost as min(v, the minimal sum of any if in its path).

So, the steps are:

1. Parse the code, maintaining a stack of dictionaries. Each dictionary tracks the sum of set instructions for each y in the current scope.

2. When encountering a set instruction, add its v to the current scope's sum for y. Also, if y == s, record this as a dangerous set.

3. When encountering an if instruction:

   a. Determine its y (Y).

   b. The current sum for Y in the previous scope (outer blocks) is the cost to block this if.

   c. Push a new dictionary onto the stack, initialized with the current sum for Y.

4. When encountering an end instruction, pop the stack.

5. For each dangerous set, collect all if blocks in its path. The minimal cost for the dangerous set is min(v, the minimal cost among the if's blocking costs in its path).

Finally, sum all these minimal costs to get the answer.

This approach seems promising. Let's test it against the samples.

Sample 1:

Code:

set 1 10 (dangerous)
set 2 15
if 2
set 1 7 (dangerous)
end

Parsing:

- Stack starts with a main scope dict, which is empty.

- Process set 1 10: add to y=1. Current scope (main) has sum for y=1: 10. This is a dangerous set.

- Process set 2 15: add to y=2. Current scope sum y=2:15.

- Process if 2:

   Y is 2. The previous scope (main) has sum for y=2:15. So the cost to block this if is 15. Push a new scope.

- Process set 1 7: add to current scope (inside if 2). sum for y=1:7. This is dangerous.

- Process end: pop the stack.

The dangerous sets are:

1. First set: cost 10. The path is no ifs. So, the only option is to remove it (cost10).

2. Third set: inside if 2. The path includes if 2. The blocking cost for if 2 is 15. So min(7, 15) → 7.

Total 10+7=17. Correct.

Sample3:

Code:

if 0 → push scope. The sum for y=0 in outer scope is 0 (since initial x is 0, but no sets have been processed). So the cost to block this if is 0. But since initial x is 0, this if will be entered unless blocked. But according to the model, the cost is 0. However, the sample's answer requires paying 1 for the dangerous set. Thus, the model's approach would suggest that for the dangerous set in the innermost if, blocking any of the parent ifs is possible. 

Let's see:

The dangerous set is in an if block nested three deep.

The path to it is:

if0 (Y=0) → sum for Y=0 is 0. Cost to block is 0.

if5 (Y=5) → sum for Y=5 in outer scopes before it. But there are no sets, so cost to block is 0.

if100 (Y=100) → sum for Y=100 in outer scopes before it is 0.

Thus, for the dangerous set, the minimal cost is min(1, min(0, 0, 0)) → 0. But the sample's answer is 1. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the model is not capturing the initial x=0 for if Y=0.

Ah! The problem is that the initial x is 0. So for an if with Y=0, even if there are no sets before it, the initial x is 0, so the if is entered. Thus, the cost to block this if is 0, but it's impossible to block it. Thus, the model's approach is incorrect.

Thus, the model must account for the initial x=0 when processing ifs with Y=0.

Thus, the cost to block an if with Y=0 is the sum of all sets with y=0 before it plus whether the initial x is 0.

But how to model this.

For example, if an if has Y=0 and there are no sets before it that set y=0, then the initial x is 0, so the if is entered. Thus, to block the if, the sum of sets must include a virtual set with y=0 and v=infinity (since there's no way to block it).

But this is not feasible.

Thus, the model must be modified to account for the initial x=0.

Thus, for an if with Y=0:

The cost to block it is the sum of all sets with y=0 before it. If this sum is 0 (no sets), then the initial x is 0, and the if is entered. Thus, the cost to block such an if is infinity (impossible to block) unless there is at least one set before it that sets y to a value other than 0.

But this is getting too complicated.

Thus, the correct approach must be:

For each if with Y=Y_i:

The cost to block it is the sum of all sets with y=Y_i that are in the code before it and in the same or outer blocks. Additionally, if Y_i is 0 and there are no such sets, then the cost is infinity, as the initial x is 0.

Thus, the cost for such ifs is:

if Y_i == 0 and sum_sets == 0 → infinity (cannot block)

else → sum_sets

Thus, the model must be modified to handle this case.

But how to implement this.

Thus, during parsing, when processing an if with Y=0:

If the sum of sets with y=0 before it is 0, then the cost to block it is infinity.

Else, the cost is sum_sets.

But this requires checking for Y=0 and sum_sets=0.

In sample3, the first if has Y=0 and sum_sets=0. Thus, the cost to block it is infinity. Thus, the dangerous set inside must be removed, costing 1.

Thus, the model would correctly handle sample3.

Thus, the correct approach is:

For each if instruction:

   if Y == 0 and sum_sets == 0:

       cost = infinity (cannot block)

   else:

       cost = sum_sets

Thus, the model now correctly handles sample3.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Parse the code, maintaining a stack of scopes. Each scope is a dictionary mapping y to the sum of set costs in that scope.

2. For each if instruction, compute the sum of sets with y=Y in the outer scopes (sum_prev). If Y ==0 and sum_prev ==0, then the cost to block is infinity. Else, it's sum_prev.

3. For each dangerous set (y=s), collect all ifs in its path. Compute the minimal cost between its own v and the minimal blocking cost of the ifs in its path.

4. Sum all these minimal costs.

Thus, the steps are:

- Track the stack of scopes.

- For each set, update the current scope.

- For each if, compute the blocking cost (sum_prev or infinity if Y==0 and sum_prev is 0).

- For each dangerous set, collect the ifs in its path and compute the minimal cost.

Now, the code can be implemented.

To implement this:

- Use a stack where each element is a dictionary (defaultdict(int)) to track the sum of sets in each scope.

- For each if, when processing, compute sum_prev as the sum of all previous scopes' sums for Y.

- For dangerous sets, track the path of ifs they are in.

But how to track the path for each dangerous set.

Thus, during parsing, we can track the current stack of ifs (their blocking costs). For each dangerous set, record the current stack of ifs. Then, for each dangerous set, the path is the list of ifs in the stack at the time of processing the set.

But the stack during processing the dangerous set is the list of ifs enclosing it. Thus, the path is the list of ifs in the stack when the set is processed.

Thus, during parsing:

- When processing a set instruction, if y == s, record it as a dangerous set and save the current stack's blocking costs (sum_prev for each if in the stack).

Thus, each dangerous set has a list of blocking costs for each if in its path.

Thus, the minimal cost for the dangerous set is the minimum between its v and the minimal blocking cost in its list.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

- Parse the code, maintaining a stack of scopes (each scope is a defaultdict(int)).

- Also, maintain a list of if_blocks, which tracks the blocking costs and Y for each if.

- For each if instruction, compute sum_prev and add it to the list of if_blocks.

- For each dangerous set, record the current list of if_blocks indices that are in the stack.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, during parsing, whenever an if is processed, its blocking cost (sum_prev or infinity) is added to a list, and the current stack of if_blocks can be tracked as indices into this list.

Thus, for each dangerous set, the path of if_blocks is the indices in the list that are active when the set is processed.

But this requires maintaining a stack of indices.

Thus, during parsing:

- A stack of if_indices. Each time an if is processed, append its index to the stack. When end is processed, pop the stack.

- A list if_costs, which contains the blocking cost of each if.

Thus, for a dangerous set, the stack contains the indices of the if_blocks in its path. The minimal blocking cost is the minimal if_costs[i] for all i in the stack.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Initialize:

stack = [0]  # dummy scope for main

scope_stack = [defaultdict(int)]

if_stack = []  # stores indices of if_blocks

if_costs = []

dangerous_sets = []

for each line in code:

    if line starts with 'set':

        parts = line.split()

        y = int(parts[1])

        v = int(parts[2])

        current_scope = scope_stack[-1]

        current_scope[y] += v

        if y == s:

            # dangerous set

            path = if_stack.copy()

            dangerous_sets.append( (v, path) )

    elif line starts with 'if':

        y = int(line.split()[1])

        sum_prev = 0

        # sum_prev is the sum of all scopes except the current

        # iterate through the scope_stack, excluding the current scope (which is being pushed)

        for scope in scope_stack[:-1]:

            sum_prev += scope.get(y, 0)

        # handle Y ==0 and sum_prev ==0

        if y == 0 and sum_prev ==0:

            cost = float('inf')

        else:

            cost = sum_prev

        if_costs.append( cost )

        if_stack.append( len(if_costs)-1 )  # index of this if

        # push a new scope for this if block

        scope_stack.append( defaultdict(int) )

    elif line == 'end':

        # pop the current scope

        scope_stack.pop()

        if_stack.pop()

Thus, for each dangerous set, we record its v and the path (list of if indices in if_stack). For each index in the path, we can retrieve the cost from if_costs.

Thus, the minimal cost for each dangerous set is min(v, min( if_costs[i] for i in path )).

The total cost is the sum of these minima.

This approach should handle all cases.

Testing sample3:

The first if is Y=0. sum_prev is 0 (no sets before it). Y=0, so cost is infinity.

Thus, for the dangerous set inside, the path includes this if. Thus, the minimal cost is min(1, infinity) → 1. Which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach should be correct.

Now, let's implement this code.

But in Python, defaultdict may be too slow for 2e5 instructions. Thus, we can use a list of dictionaries, perhaps with default 0.

But for efficiency, using ordinary dictionaries and checking if the key exists.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read n and s.

Parse the next n lines.

Initialize scope_stack as [{}], a list of dictionaries.

if_costs = []

if_stack = []

dangerous_sets = []

for each line in lines:

    if line starts with 'set':

        parts = line.split()

        y = int(parts[1])

        v = int(parts[2])

        current_scope = scope_stack[-1]

        if y in current_scope:

            current_scope[y] += v

        else:

            current_scope[y] = v

        if y == s:

            path = list(if_stack)

            dangerous_sets.append( (v, path) )

    elif line starts with 'if':

        y = int(line.split()[1])

        sum_prev = 0

        for scope in scope_stack[:-1]:

            sum_prev += scope.get(y, 0)

        if y == 0 and sum_prev ==0:

            cost = float('inf')

        else:

            cost = sum_prev

        if_costs.append(cost)

        if_stack.append( len(if_costs)-1 )

        scope_stack.append( {} )

    elif line == 'end':

        scope_stack.pop()

        if_stack.pop()

total_cost = 0

for v, path in dangerous_sets:

    min_block = v

    for i in path:

        if if_costs[i] < min_block:

            min_block = if_costs[i]

    total_cost += min_block

print(total_cost)

This code should work.
