Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of strings t that have exactly a certain beauty relative to a given string s. The beauty is the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring of t from i to j is lex greater than the corresponding substring of s. And I have to compute this modulo 1e9+7.

Hmm. Let's start by understanding the problem. For each possible string t of length n, we calculate the number of (i,j) pairs where t's substring i..j is lex larger than s's substring i..j. We need to find how many such t's have exactly k such pairs.

Constraints are n up to 2000 and k up to 2000. So the solution has to be O(n^2 * k) time, maybe. Because with n=2000, O(n^3) is 8e10 which is way too big. So we need a dynamic programming approach that can handle this.

First, think about how the beauty is calculated. For each possible (i,j), the substring t[i..j] must be larger than s[i..j]. So for each position (i,j), if in t, the first differing character in the substring i..j from s's substring is at some position, and t's character is larger than s's, then that contributes 1 to the beauty. Otherwise, if t's substring is equal or smaller, then it doesn't contribute.

But checking all possible (i,j) for all possible t's is impossible. So we need a way to model this efficiently.

Let me think about each (i,j) pair. For a given (i,j), the contribution to the beauty is 1 if t's substring i..j is larger than s's. The key is to find the number of ways that t's substring is larger for exactly k pairs (i,j).

But how do these pairs interact? For example, if t[i..j] is larger than s[i..j], then any pair (i', j') that is contained within (i,j) might also have their own contributions. Wait, but each (i,j) is considered independently. Wait, the problem counts all (i,j) pairs where the substring t[i..j] is larger than s's. So even if a longer substring includes a smaller one, each is considered separately. So each (i,j) is a separate condition. So the total beauty is the sum over all possible (i,j) pairs of 1 if t's substring is larger, else 0.

So the problem reduces to, for each (i,j) pair, whether t[i..j] is lex larger than s[i..j], and the total sum of all such 1's must be exactly k.

The challenge is to model this sum with DP.

But how to model the dependencies between different (i,j) pairs. Because changing a character in t can affect multiple (i,j) pairs. For example, changing t[i] can affect all substrings starting at i. So it's a complex interaction.

Hmm. So perhaps we need to find a way to model the problem by considering each position and how the choices affect the various (i,j) pairs. But this seems complicated.

Alternative approach: For each position i in the string t, determine how the choice of t[i] affects the number of (i,j) pairs that become lex larger. Wait, but each (i,j) pair depends on the entire substring. So for a substring i..j, the lex order is determined by the first position where t and s differ. So, if for some position m in i..j, t[m] > s[m], and all positions before m (from i to m-1) are equal, then t[i..j] is larger. Similarly, if all characters are equal, then the substring is not larger.

So for each (i,j), the contribution to the beauty is 1 if there exists a position m in [i, j] such that t[m] > s[m], and for all positions i <= k < m, t[k] = s[k]. Otherwise, the contribution is 0.

So the total beauty is the sum over all (i,j) pairs where this condition holds.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to model this with DP by considering the earliest position where a character differs.

Another idea: For each position i, determine the possible choices for t[i] and track how each choice affects the count of (i,j) pairs. For example, if t[i] is chosen to be larger than s[i], then all substrings starting at i and ending at j >= i where the first differing character is i will contribute 1. Similarly, if t[i] is equal to s[i], then we have to look further to the right for a differing character.

But how to model this in a DP. Let's think: for each position, we can track the state of how the previous characters compare. The key is that the earliest differing position determines the contributions of certain (i,j) pairs.

Wait, here's an approach. Let's process the string from left to right. For each position i, when choosing t[i], we can track for each possible j >= i whether this choice affects the (i,j) pairs. But this is again O(n^2), which is too much for n=2000.

Alternatively, perhaps for each position i, the choice of t[i] can affect all substrings that start at i. For example, if t[i] is larger than s[i], then all j >= i, the substring i..j will be considered as contributing 1 to the beauty, provided that all previous positions from i to j-1 (if any) are equal. Wait, no. For a substring i..j, the first differing position can be i, i+1, ..., j. If the first differing position is m (in [i, j]), then the substring i..j is considered as contributing 1 if t[m] > s[m]. So for each m, any substring starting at i <= m and ending at j >= m would have a contribution if their first differing position is m and t[m] > s[m].

Hmm. Maybe we can model for each position m (from 1 to n), the number of substrings (i,j) where m is the first differing position in i..j. Then, for each m, the total contribution from this m is the number of such (i,j) pairs multiplied by whether t[m] is chosen to be larger than s[m].

Wait, that might be a way. Let me think. For each position m, if t[m] is greater than s[m], then all substrings that start at i <= m and end at j >= m, and for which m is the first differing position in i..j, will contribute 1 to the beauty. So, the total number of such substrings is the number of possible i's that are <= m and such that for all positions from i to m-1, t[k] equals s[k], multiplied by the number of j's >= m such that for all positions from m+1 to j, if any, they are equal (but this may not matter). Wait, no. Because the first differing position is m, so all positions from i to m-1 must be equal. The j can be any position >= m. So for a fixed m, the number of substrings (i,j) where m is the first differing position and t[m] > s[m] is equal to the number of possible i's (from the earliest possible i to m) multiplied by the number of possible j's (from m to the latest possible j).

Wait, for example, if m is the first differing position in i..j, then i can be any position in [1, m], but such that for all positions from i to m-1, t[k] == s[k]. Then, j can be any position from m to n. So the number of such (i,j) pairs for a particular m is the number of possible i's multiplied by (n - m + 1), since j can be any from m to n.

But the number of possible i's depends on how many consecutive positions from the left of m are equal. Because i can be any position such that from i to m-1, all t[k] == s[k]. So for example, if m is 3, then i can be 3 (so i=m), or i=2 if t[2] == s[2], and i=1 if t[1] == s[1] and t[2] == s[2].

So for each m, the number of possible i's is equal to the length of the prefix up to m where all previous characters are equal. Let's call this l_m. Then the number of i's for m is l_m, and the number of j's is (n - m + 1). So for each m, the contribution to the beauty is l_m * (n - m + 1), provided that t[m] > s[m].

If t[m] is less than s[m], then no contribution. If t[m] is equal, then l increases by 1 (so l_{m+1} = l_m + 1). If t[m] is greater, then l_{m+1} = 0 (because any substring starting after m will have their first differing position at m+1 or beyond, but after m, since m's t is greater, but maybe that's not right). Wait, no. l_m represents the number of possible i's where i can be as far left as possible such that all characters from i to m-1 are equal to s's. If at m, t[m] is not equal to s[m], then for any i <= m, the first differing position is m (if i <= m and the previous characters are equal). So when t[m] is not equal to s[m], then l_{m+1} is 0, because any substring starting at m+1 will have their own first differing positions.

So the idea is to track l_m, which is the length of the current run of equal characters starting from some i up to m-1. Then, when choosing t[m], there are three possibilities:

1. t[m] < s[m]: Then, for all substrings where m is the first differing position (i.e., i's in l_m), those contribute 0. Also, since the current character is smaller, all possible i's for future positions (m+1) would be 0, because once a character is less, any substring starting at i <= m would have a first differing position before m+1, which is smaller. So in this case, l_{m+1} = 0.

2. t[m] == s[m]: Then, the current run continues. The number of i's for m is l_m, but since t[m] is equal, the first differing position for i..j (where j >= m) is beyond m. So the contribution for m is zero. However, l_{m+1} = l_m + 1. Because now, for position m+1, the possible i's can be from i to m+1, but only if all characters up to m are equal. So the run length increases by 1.

3. t[m] > s[m]: Then, the contribution from m is l_m * (n - m + 1). Then, since this character is larger, the run length resets to 0, because any substring starting after m can't have their first differing position before m. So l_{m+1} = 0.

Wait, but maybe l is the maximum possible number of i's for which the current prefix up to m-1 is equal. For example, if up to m-1, the run is l_m, then for m, if t[m] is equal, the run becomes l_m + 1. Otherwise, it's 0.

So for each position m, when we choose t[m], the choice affects the current contribution (if t[m] > s[m], then add l_m * (n - m +1) to the beauty) and the next run length (l_{m+1} = 0 if t[m] != s[m], else l_m+1).

So this suggests that the state of the DP can be (current position, current run length l, current total beauty). But since l can be up to m (which is up to 2000), and the beauty k is up to 2000, the state would be O(n^2 k), which for n=2000 and k=2000 is 8e9, which is way too big.

Wait, but the run length l can't exceed the current position. For example, at position m, the maximum l is m. Because l is the number of consecutive equal characters starting from m - l +1 to m-1, so l can't be larger than m. But with n up to 2000, l can be up to 2000. So the state would be m (2000), l (2000), k (2000). The total number of states would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10, which is way too much. That's impossible.

So this approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the run length l can be represented as the maximum possible, but maybe we can model it in a way that doesn't track the exact value of l, but instead tracks l in a compressed way. For example, when t[m] is equal to s[m], then l increases by 1. Otherwise, it resets to 0. So, for each position m, the possible choices are to take t[m] as equal, less, or greater, and track the possible l values.

Wait, but even with this, the l can be up to 2000. So for each m, the possible l's are up to m. So this seems tricky.

Wait, but maybe for each position m, the contribution when t[m] is greater than s[m] is l * (n - m +1). So the maximum possible contribution for a single position is l * (n -m +1). Since n can be 2000, and l can be up to m, which is up to 2000, the maximum possible contribution per position could be up to 2000*2000 = 4e6. But k is up to 2000, which is way smaller. So in the DP, once the current total beauty exceeds k, we can ignore those states. So perhaps the DP state can be optimized by only considering up to k.

So, for each position m, and current run length l, and current total beauty b, we can track the number of ways to reach this state. Then, when processing each step, we can:

- For the current state (m, l, b), consider the possible choices for t[m] (greater than, equal to, less than s[m]).

For each choice, compute the new beauty and new run length.

But the problem is that even with this approach, the state space is O(n * l_max * k), where l_max is up to 2000, and n and k are 2000 each. So 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9 states, which is way too big. Even with optimizations, this is not feasible.

We need a way to reduce the state space.

Alternative approach: Observe that when a character is chosen to be greater than s[m], the contribution is l * (n -m +1). Then, the run length l' for the next step is zero. So, for this choice, the beauty increases by l * (n -m +1), and l' is zero.

If the character is equal, the contribution is zero, and l' is l +1.

If the character is less than, the contribution is zero, and l' is zero.

But the key point is that when the choice is to take a character greater than s[m], the contribution is fixed as l * (n -m +1), and this is added to the beauty. Since the maximum possible contribution per step is l * (n -m +1), and k is up to 2000, perhaps we can model the DP with state (m, l), and track the possible beauty counts up to k. Wait, but for each m and l, the possible beauty counts can be up to k. So the DP state would be (m, l, b), which is again O(n^2k), which is 8e10. Not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Let's model the DP with states (m, l), and track for each possible beauty count up to k. Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Another angle: For each position m, the maximum possible contribution to the beauty from this position is (m) * (n -m +1). For example, when l is m (which is possible only if all previous characters are equal), then the contribution would be m * (n -m +1). But when m increases, this value could be up to 2000*2000=4e6, which is way larger than k=2000. So, if the total beauty is allowed to be up to 2000, then for a lot of choices (where the contribution is more than k - current_b), we can ignore those states because they would exceed k.

So in the DP, whenever adding the current contribution would make the beauty exceed k, we can ignore those transitions. This can reduce the number of states.

So, the DP can track for each position m, the current run length l, and the current beauty b. For each state, we process the possible transitions.

The transitions are:

For each possible state (m, l, b), for each possible choice of t[m]:

Case 1: t[m] > s[m]:

- The contribution is l * (n - m + 1). So new_b = b + contrib. If new_b > k, skip.
- The new run length is 0.
- So next state is (m+1, 0, new_b).

Case 2: t[m] == s[m]:

- Contribution is 0. new_b = b.
- new run length is l + 1.
- next state is (m+1, l+1, new_b).

Case 3: t[m] < s[m]:

- Contribution is 0. new_b = b.
- new run length is 0.
- next state is (m+1, 0, new_b).

Now, the initial state is (0, 0, 0). Then, after processing all positions (up to m=n), the answer is the sum of all states (n, l, k).

But the problem is that the state space is still O(n * l * k), which for n=2000, l up to 2000, k=2000 is 8e9. But with the optimizations that for each step, the possible l is up to m (since at position m, the run length can't be longer than m steps). So for m=2000, l can be up to 2000. But even so, this is way too big.

So we need a way to model the DP more efficiently.

Alternative Idea: Notice that the run length l can be tracked in a way that, for a given position m, the possible l is up to m. But perhaps for some steps, when m is large, and l is large, but the current beauty is such that adding the contribution would exceed k, those can be pruned.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that for a given m and l, the possible contribution from m is l * (n - m + 1). So if l * (n - m +1) > k, then taking this choice would exceed k, so we can ignore such transitions.

But since k can be up to 2000, this would allow us to limit l for each m. For example, for position m, the maximum l that can contribute to the beauty (without exceeding k) is floor(k / (n - m +1)).

So for each m, the possible l is up to min(m, k // (n -m +1)). So when (n -m +1) is large, like when m is small, the maximum l allowed is small. For example, when m=0, n -m +1 is 2001. Then l can be up to 0, because 2000 / 2001 is 0. So for m=0, the l can't contribute much. Wait, but m starts from 1 to n. Hmm.

Wait, m ranges from 1 to n. For each m, the maximum possible contribution is l * (n -m +1). So for l to contribute to a transition where adding to b doesn't exceed k, we must have l * (n -m +1) ≤ k - current_b. Since current_b can be up to k, the maximum possible l for a given m is k / (n -m +1). For example, if (n -m +1) is 1 (when m = n), then the maximum l that can contribute is k. So for m = n, l can be up to k. But l is also up to m (since for m, l can be up to m). So for m=2000, the maximum l is min(m, k). Since m=2000 and k=2000, it's 2000. So this approach doesn't help much for large m.

Hmm. So this idea might not help enough.

Alternative Idea: Let's consider that the run length l is the number of consecutive equal characters up to position m-1. So for each m, l can be up to m-1. But how does this affect the transitions?

Wait, perhaps we can model the run length l in a compressed way. For example, for a given m, the run length can't exceed m. So for m steps, the maximum possible l is m. But perhaps during transitions, the run length can only increase by 1 when we choose to take equal characters, and reset to 0 otherwise.

Another observation: When the current run length is l, then choosing to take a character equal to s[m] increases the run length to l+1, but choosing any other option (greater or less than) resets it to 0. So the possible transitions for the run length are limited. For example, from a run length of l, after choosing equal, it becomes l+1. Otherwise, 0.

But how can this help with the DP? Maybe the run length can be represented in terms of the previous run length, but it's not clear.

Wait, let's think about the possible ways to reach a certain run length l' at position m+1. For example, to have a run length l' at m+1:

- If we choose to take t[m] equal to s[m], then the previous run length must have been l' -1. Because the run length increases by 1.

- Otherwise, if we take t[m] as not equal, then the new run length is 0.

So, when processing position m, the run length l can be up to m. But perhaps for each m, the possible l's are up to m, but this is unavoidable.

Alternative Idea: The problem requires that the total beauty is exactly k. So, during transitions, whenever adding the current contribution would cause the beauty to exceed k, those transitions can be ignored. This can help in pruning the state space.

So, in the DP, for each state (m, l, b), if adding the contribution for choosing t[m] > s[m] (which is l * (n -m +1)) would make b + contrib >k, then we can skip this transition.

This way, the beauty b can only be up to k. So the possible values of b are from 0 to k.

But the l can be up to m, which is up to 2000. So the total state space is n * l_max * k = 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9. That's way too big. Even with pruning, it's impossible to handle in Python.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps, for each position m, we can precompute the maximum possible contribution that can be added from m onwards. If even adding all possible contributions from the remaining positions can't reach k, then we can prune that state. But this requires a way to calculate the maximum possible remaining contributions, which may not be straightforward.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is similar to a knapsack problem where each step adds a certain amount to the total. The maximum possible contribution for a step is l * (n -m +1). But how to model this.

Alternatively, we can model the problem as follows:

At each position m, we track the current possible run length l and the current beauty b. The transitions depend on the choice of t[m].

The key insight is that when we choose t[m] to be greater than s[m], the contribution to the beauty is l * (n -m +1), and the run length resets to 0. Choosing equal or less adds 0 to the beauty, but equal increases the run length, and less resets it.

But to model this in a way that avoids tracking l up to 2000, perhaps we can note that for each m, the run length l can be up to m, but considering that the maximum possible contribution from m is l * (n -m +1). Since k is up to 2000, for a particular m and l, if l * (n -m +1) is larger than the remaining needed beauty (k - current_b), then even if we choose to take this option, it will exceed k. So in such cases, we can ignore this transition. This can help in pruning the possible l's for each m.

For example, for a current state (m, l, b), the remaining beauty needed is rem = k - b. If l * (n -m +1) > rem, then choosing to take the greater option will result in a contribution that's too large, so we can skip this choice.

Thus, for each m and l, the maximum possible l that can contribute without exceeding k is rem // (n -m +1). Since rem can be up to k, for each m, the maximum l is min(l, rem // (n -m +1)).

This can reduce the possible l's for each m. For example, for m=1000 and n=2000, (n -m +1) is 1001. Then the maximum l is rem//1001, which for rem up to 2000 is 2. So l can be up to 2. But in other positions, like m=2000, (n -m +1) is 1, so rem can be up to 2000, which allows l up to 2000. So for this case, the pruning won't help.

But this approach can still help reduce the number of states. However, in the worst case, this may not be enough. So perhaps we can find another way.

Alternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of independent positions. For example, if we can model the DP such that the run length l is represented by the number of consecutive equal characters up to position m-1, but this can be tracked in a way that allows us to compute the possible contributions without explicitly tracking l.

Wait, perhaps the run length l can be determined by the choices made in the previous steps. For example, if up to position m-1, the run length is l, then this implies that the last l characters (from position m-l to m-1) were equal to s's characters. So the run length is the maximum possible l such that all characters from m-l to m-1 are equal to s's. 

But how to model this? It's not clear.

Alternative Idea: Let's consider that for each position m, the run length l is the maximum possible i such that all characters from i to m-1 are equal to s's. Then, the contribution when choosing to take a greater character at m is l * (n - m +1). So for each position m, the possible l can be up to m, but maybe we can model this in terms of the previous run lengths.

Wait, here's an important observation: when a character is chosen to be equal to s[m], the run length increases by 1. If the character is not equal, the run length becomes 0. So the run length depends only on the previous run length and the current choice. For example:

At position m, if the previous run length was l_prev, then:

- If we choose to take t[m] equal to s[m], then the new run length is l_prev + 1.

- If we choose to take t[m] greater or less than s[m], then the new run length is 0.

So, the run length is determined by the previous run length and the choice made at position m. This allows us to model the transitions for the run length.

So, the run length l_prev at step m is the number of consecutive equal characters up to m-1. Then, the choices for t[m] determine the new run length l_new.

With this, the DP state can be represented as (m, l_prev, b). But how to manage the transitions.

But even with this, the state space is O(n * l_prev * b) = 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9, which is too large.

So we need a way to compress this state.

Alternative Idea: Let's think about the possible values of l_prev. For each position m, the maximum l_prev is m. But when m increases, l_prev can be up to m. However, when choosing to make the run length l_prev +1, this can only happen if the character is equal. But in such cases, the contribution is 0. So, the beauty is not increased, but the run length increases.

So, perhaps the run length l_prev can be tracked for each position m, and the beauty b. But the problem is that even with this, the state space is too large.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the run length can be represented in a way that allows us to merge certain states. For example, if two different run lengths at position m have the same possible contribution for future steps, then they can be merged.

But I'm not sure how to do this.

Wait, when a character is chosen to be equal, the run length increases. But the contribution to the beauty is only when a character is greater than s[m]. So the run length only affects the possible contribution of future steps. For example, a higher run length at position m allows a larger contribution if we choose to take a greater character at some future position.

But how to model this without tracking all possible run lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that the optimal way to choose characters is to have as much run length as possible when making a greater choice, thereby maximizing the contribution. But since the problem requires exactly k, this is not necessarily helpful.

Alternative Idea: Let's model the DP in terms of the possible run length and the current beauty. But since the run length can be up to m, which is 2000, perhaps we can find that for each m, the run length can be up to m, but for beauty up to k, we can manage this with some optimizations.

Wait, let's proceed with the DP approach and see if it can be optimized.

The initial state is (m=0, l=0, b=0). Then, for each position m from 1 to n, we process the transitions.

At each step, for each possible (l_prev, b_prev), we compute the possible new states (l_new, b_new) based on the choices for t[m].

But in practice, for each m, the possible l_prev can be up to m-1, and b_prev up to k.

We can model this with a DP table where dp[m][l][b] is the number of ways to reach position m with a run length l and beauty b.

But given the size constraints, this is impossible. So we need to find a way to represent this more efficiently.

Alternative Idea: Since for each position m, the run length l can only transition to l+1 (if choosing equal) or 0 (otherwise), perhaps we can model the DP for each position m with two layers: the current m and the next m+1. This way, we can use a 2D array (current l and b) for each step, and reuse space.

But even this would require O(l_max * k) space for each step. With l_max up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this is 4e6 per step. For 2000 steps, this is 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow in Python.

Alternative Idea: Let's think about the maximum possible contribution from each position. For example, the contribution from position m is l_prev * (n -m +1). So if l_prev is large, this can contribute a lot. But since k is up to 2000, any contribution that would make the beauty exceed k can be pruned.

So, for each position m, the maximum possible contribution is l_prev * (n -m +1). For a given current beauty b, the allowed contribution is at most k - b. So for each possible (m, l_prev, b), the possible choices are:

- If choosing to take t[m] > s[m], then the contribution is l_prev * (n -m +1). If this is more than k - b, then this choice is invalid.

So, during the transitions, we can skip any (l_prev, b) where l_prev * (n -m +1) > k - b.

This can help reduce the number of transitions.

Another optimization is that the run length l_prev can be up to m. But when m increases, this can get up to 2000. So this is still problematic.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the run length l_prev can be merged with the current position m, such that l_prev can't exceed m. So for position m, the maximum possible l_prev is m. But for each m, when processing, we can iterate l_prev up to m.

But even this, with m up to 2000 and l_prev up to m, for each step m, we have up to m possible l_prev values. So for m=2000, this is 2000 * 2000 = 4e6 operations per step, which is 8e9 total operations. Which is way too slow in Python.

So this approach isn't feasible.

Hmm. Maybe there's a mathematical way to model this problem.

Let's think differently. For each position m, there are three possibilities for t[m]:

1. t[m] < s[m]: This choice contributes 0 to the beauty. All substrings (i,j) that include m and have their first differing position at m will not contribute (since t[m] is less than s[m]). The run length l resets to 0.

2. t[m] == s[m]: This choice contributes 0 to the beauty. The run length l increases by 1.

3. t[m] > s[m]: This choice contributes l_prev * (n -m +1) to the beauty. The run length l resets to 0.

So, for each position m, the number of choices for t[m] depends on the current l_prev and the character s[m].

For example, the number of possible t[m] < s[m] is the number of characters less than s[m], which is (s[m] - 'a') possible choices. The number of choices for t[m] == s[m] is 1. The number of choices for t[m] > s[m] is 26 - (s[m] - 'a' + 1) = 25 - (s[m] - 'a').

So, for each position m, the possible choices and their counts are:

less = ord(s[m-1]) - ord('a')  (since Python uses 0-based indices)
equal = 1
greater = 25 - (ord(s[m-1]) - ord('a')) 

Wait, because s is a string, and the problem is 1-based in the problem statement. But in Python, the indices are 0-based. So for position m (1-based), s[m-1] is the character.

So, for each position m (1-based), the counts are:

char = s[m-1]
less_count = ord(char) - ord('a')
equal_count = 1
greater_count = 25 - (ord(char) - ord('a')) 

But if char is 'a', then less_count is 0. If char is 'z', greater_count is 0.

So, for each position m, these three counts are precomputed.

Now, the key is to model the DP transitions based on these counts and the contributions to the beauty.

But how to model this efficiently.

Let's think of the DP as a 2D array where for each step m, we track the current run length l and the current beauty b. For each step, we can iterate through all possible l and b values and compute the next state.

But given the time constraints, this approach is not feasible for large n and k.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the run length l can be represented implicitly. For example, when we choose to make a character equal, the run length increases, but the beauty is not affected. So for positions where the run length is increasing, the beauty remains the same. So perhaps for each position m, the beauty can be represented as b plus the contributions from previous steps, and the run length can be managed as a separate parameter.

But again, this leads back to the same state space.

Hmm. Let's try to proceed with this approach and see if we can find a way to optimize it.

We'll represent the DP as a dictionary or a 2D array where dp[l][b] represents the number of ways to achieve a run length of l and beauty of b after processing the first m characters.

But for each step, we can have a current DP table and a next DP table. For each m, we iterate through the current DP table, process the three possible choices, and update the next DP table accordingly.

But given the size, even with this, it's going to be O(n * l_max * k) operations. Let's see:

For each m in 1..n:

   For each l_prev in 0..m-1:

      For each b_prev in 0..k:

          if dp_prev[l_prev][b_prev] is 0, skip.

          process the three choices:

              choice 1: greater

              contrib = l_prev * (n - m +1)

              if b_prev + contrib > k: skip.

              new_b = b_prev + contrib

              next_dp[0][new_b] += dp_prev[l_prev][b_prev] * greater_count

              choice 2: equal

              new_l = l_prev + 1

              next_dp[new_l][b_prev] += dp_prev[l_prev][b_prev] * equal_count

              choice 3: less

              next_dp[0][b_prev] += dp_prev[l_prev][b_prev] * less_count

But even with this, for m=2000, l_prev can be up to 2000, and b_prev up to 2000. So for each m, it's 2000 * 2000 =4e6 operations. For 2000 steps, this is 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.

But wait, in practice, for each m, the maximum possible l_prev is m-1. So for m=1, l_prev can be 0. For m=2, l_prev can be 0 or 1. So the total number of (m, l_prev) pairs is 1 + 2 + ... + 2000 = 2000*2001/2 = ~2e6. And for each of these, multiplied by the possible b_prev values (up to k=2000), it's 2e6 * 2000 = 4e9 operations. Which is way too much.

So this approach is not feasible. We need a better way.

Alternative Idea: Let's notice that the run length can be tracked in a way that allows us to aggregate the contributions. For example, the contribution from position m when choosing greater is l_prev * (n -m +1). So the beauty increases by this amount. So perhaps we can model the problem as a dynamic program where, for each position m and current beauty b, we track the possible l_prev values and their counts.

But this still requires tracking l_prev and b, which is O(n*k) per step.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps we can find that the contribution for each position m can be represented as a certain number of ways to add a certain amount to the beauty. For example, when we choose to take a greater character at m with run length l_prev, then the beauty increases by l_prev * (n -m +1). So this is similar to a knapsack problem where each item (m) has a variable weight depending on the previous state (l_prev). But knapsack with variable weight is hard.

Alternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in reverse. For example, process the string from right to left. But I'm not sure how this would help.

Alternative Idea: Let's think about each position m, and for each possible run length l_prev, precompute the possible contributions and transitions. But this again brings us back to the same state space.

Hmm. Let's look for patterns in the examples.

First example:

Input:

2 2

yz

Output: 26

So, the string s is "yz". For n=2, we need t's beauty to be exactly 2. How is this possible?

The beauty is the number of pairs (i,j) where t's substring i..j is lex larger than s's. For s=yz:

The possible (i,j) pairs are:

(1,1), (1,2), (2,2).

For t to have beauty 2, exactly two of these pairs must be lex larger.

The possible t's must have:

Either:

t[1..1] > 'y' (so t[1] must be > 'y' → 'z'). But then t[1..2] would be 'z' followed by t[2]. To have t[1..2] > 'yz', the first character is 'z' which is equal, so the second must be > 'z' → which is impossible. So this case is not possible.

Alternatively, t could have two pairs where i=1 and j=2, and perhaps others. Or, maybe two pairs of (2,2) and another pair. But the sample output is 26, which suggests that all 26 possible t's are those where t is "ya", "yb", ..., "yz" (but no, wait). Wait the output is 26, which is 26^1. So perhaps in this case, all possible t's have exactly two pairs. Wait, maybe the correct answer is when t[2] is any character greater than 'z' (but that's impossible), so perhaps another scenario.

Wait, let's think again. For s=yz, the possible t's that have beauty 2 must have exactly two pairs (i,j) where t's substring is larger. For example, t could be "yz", but then no pairs. Or t could be "yy", then compare each substring.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine the sample:

The first sample input is:

2 2

yz

The output is 26.

So there are 26 possible t's that have beauty 2.

Each of these t's must have exactly two pairs where their substring is larger than s's.

So how can that happen?

For example, consider t = 'za' where s is 'yz'. The substrings:

i=1, j=1: 'z' > 'y' → contributes 1.

i=1, j=2: 'za' > 'yz' → since first character is 'z' (equal), second 'a' is less than 'z'. So this substring is less. So contributes 0.

i=2, j=2: 'a' > 'z' → no.

So total beauty is 1. Not enough.

But the sample output is 26. So what's the correct t's?

Ah, perhaps the correct case is when t's second character is larger than 'z' (which is impossible, as 'z' is the largest). So this approach is not working.

Alternatively, perhaps the beauty is calculated as 2 in the first example when both (1,2) and (2,2) contribute. But for that, t's substring (1,2) must be larger than 'yz', and (2,2) must be larger than 'z'.

But how? For (1,2) to be larger than 'yz', the first character must be 'y' (since it's equal), and the second must be larger than 'z', which is impossible. So this is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem statement. Let me re-read it.

The problem says that the beauty is the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring t[i..j] is lex larger than s[i..j].

The lex order comparison is done as per the standard definition: find the first position where they differ, and compare.

So for two substrings of the same length, it's straightforward. But for substrings of different lengths, it's possible that one is longer but the other is lex larger.

Wait, no. The problem says that the comparison is between substrings of the same length, because we are comparing s[i..j] and t[i..j]. So the substrings are of the same length. So for (i,j) pairs, the length is j -i +1.

So in the first example, for s=yz (n=2), the pairs are:

(1,1): compare 'y' and t[1].

(1,2): compare 'yz' and t[1..2].

(2,2): compare 'z' and t[2].

The sample output is 26, which suggests that all possible t's have beauty 2. But that's not possible unless all t's have two pairs where their substrings are larger. How?

Ah, wait, perhaps the sample is such that the only way to achieve beauty 2 is to have t be a string where t[2] is greater than 'z' (which is impossible), but this isn't the case. So maybe the sample's explanation is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct scenario is when t is 'yz' and some other conditions. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, let's think of the sample input:

n=2, k=2, s=yz.

What's the answer?

The output is 26. So 26 possible t's.

Which t's?

Let me think:

We need exactly two pairs (i,j) where t's substring is larger than s's.

For each t:

For (1,1) to be larger than 'y', t[1] must be > 'y' (i.e., 'z'). For (1,2), the substring must be larger than 'yz'. So if t[1] is 'z', then the first character is larger, so the entire substring is larger, regardless of t[2]. So for (1,1) and (1,2) pairs, t's substring would contribute 2. But then the beauty would be 2. So any t where t[1] is 'z' would have beauty at least 1 (for (1,1)), and also (1,2) would contribute 1 if the entire substring is larger. So if t[1] is 'z', then for (1,2), since the first character is larger, the entire substring is larger. So this contributes 2 to the beauty. But what about the (2,2) pair? If t[2] is larger than 'z', but that's impossible. So the (2,2) pair would contribute 0.

So the total beauty would be 2 (from (1,1) and (1,2)) for any t where t[1] is 'z'. The (2,2) pair would contribute 0, since t[2] can't be larger than 'z'.

So the number of such t's is 26: t[1] is 'z', and t[2] can be any character (since the first two pairs contribute 2, and the third pair contributes 0). So the total beauty is 2.

So the answer is 26.

Thus, the sample makes sense.

So in this case, the choice of t[1] being 'z' (greater than s[1] = 'y') contributes two pairs: (1,1) and (1,2). The run length for m=1 is l_prev=0. So when choosing t[1] as greater, the contribution is 0 * (2 -1 +1) =0*2=0. Wait, that's not possible. What's wrong here?

Wait, according to our previous model, when choosing t[m] greater than s[m], the contribution is l_prev * (n -m +1). In the first example, m=1 (position 1), l_prev is 0. So the contribution would be 0 * (2 -1 +1) =0. But the actual contribution is 2 pairs. So the model is incorrect.

This suggests that our previous model is wrong. Which means that our approach is flawed.

So we need to re-examine the problem.

Ah! The error is in how the model calculates the contribution. Earlier reasoning assumed that the contribution from position m is l_prev * (n -m +1), but in the sample, this is not the case.

So the model is incorrect. Hence, the approach based on this model is invalid.

This is a critical error and requires rethinking the problem.

So, let's re-express the contribution of choosing t[m] > s[m].

When t[m] is greater than s[m], the contribution is the number of pairs (i,j) where i <= m <= j, and the first differing position between t and s in the substring i..j is m.

In this scenario, for each such i and j, the pair (i,j) is counted in the beauty.

So the number of such pairs is the number of possible i's (from i to m) where all characters from i to m-1 are equal to s's, multiplied by the number of possible j's (from m to n).

The number of i's is the run length l_prev, which is the maximum number of consecutive equal characters up to m-1.

So the contribution is l_prev * (n - m +1) + 1 * (n - m +1) ? Wait, no. Because the run length l_prev represents the number of possible i's for which i can be as low as m - l_prev +1, up to m. So the number of i's is l_prev +1? Or is l_prev the number of possible i's?

Wait, earlier analysis said that l_prev is the number of possible i's such that all characters from i to m-1 are equal. So for example, if l_prev is 2, then i can be m-2, m-1, m. Wait, no. Wait, l_prev is the number of consecutive equal characters up to m-1.

For example, suppose m=3, and the previous run length is 2. This means that t[1] and t[2] were equal to s[1] and s[2], and t[3] is being considered. The run length l_prev is 2, which means that the i's can be 2 (m-1 -1 +1) ? Or perhaps l_prev is the maximum number of consecutive equal characters ending at m-1. So, for example, if the run length is l_prev, then the positions m - l_prev, m - l_prev +1, ..., m-1 are all equal to s's. So i can be any position from m - l_prev to m-1, or m.

Wait, perhaps the run length l_prev is the number of consecutive equal characters ending at position m-1. So for example, if l_prev is 3, then positions m-3, m-2, m-1 are all equal to s's. So when we choose to make t[m] greater than s[m], the number of i's is l_prev + 1. Because i can be m - l_prev, m - l_prev +1, ..., m.

So the number of i's is (l_prev +1), and the number of j's is (n - m +1). So the contribution is (l_prev +1) * (n -m +1).

Ah! This is the critical mistake. The run length l_prev is the number of consecutive equal characters ending at position m-1. So the number of i's that can form a substring starting at i and ending at j >= m, where the first differing position is m, is (l_prev +1) (i can be m - l_prev, m - l_prev +1, ..., m). So the contribution for choosing t[m] > s[m] is (l_prev +1) * (n -m +1).

This explains why in the first sample, when choosing t[1] as 'z' (greater than 'y'), the contribution is (0 +1) * (2 -1 +1) = 1 * 2 = 2. Which matches the sample's beauty of 2.

So the previous model was wrong. The correct contribution is (l_prev +1) * (n -m +1).

This changes everything. Now, the model must be adjusted.

So, the correct transitions are:

When choosing t[m] > s[m], the contribution is (l_prev +1) * (n -m +1). Then, the new run length is 0.

When choosing t[m] == s[m], the new run length is l_prev +1.

When choosing t[m] < s[m], the new run length is 0.

So, the key error was in the initial model's calculation of the contribution. The correct contribution is (l_prev +1) multiplied by the number of j's.

Now, the model is correct.

So, the DP state should be (m, l_prev, b), where l_prev is the current run length (number of consecutive equal characters up to m-1). The transitions are:

For each state (m, l_prev, b):

1. Choosing t[m] > s[m]:

   contribution = (l_prev +1) * (n - m + 1)
   new_b = b + contribution
   if new_b >k: skip
   new_l = 0
   add to next_dp[new_l][new_b] += count * greater_count

2. Choosing t[m] == s[m]:

   contribution = 0
   new_b = b
   new_l = l_prev + 1
   add to next_dp[new_l][new_b] += count * equal_count

3. Choosing t[m] < s[m]:

   contribution = 0
   new_b = b
   new_l = 0
   add to next_dp[new_l][new_b] += count * less_count

The initial state is (m=0, l_prev=0, b=0), with count 1.

After processing all positions, the answer is the sum of all counts in states (m=n, l, k), for any l.

This is the correct model.

Now, the state space is (m, l_prev, b). For each m, l_prev can be up to m (since run length is the number of consecutive equals up to m-1, which can be at most m). But for m=2000, l_prev can be 2000, and k=2000, so the state space is 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9, which is still too large.

But with the contribution now being (l_prev+1) * (n -m +1), the maximum possible contribution per step is (2000 +1) * 2000 = 4e6, but k is only 2000. So, for each step, the contribution must not exceed k - current b. So, for each state (m, l_prev, b), the possible contribution is (l_prev+1) * (n -m +1). This must be <= k - b. Otherwise, the transition is invalid.

This allows us to prune the l_prev values for each m.

For example, for a given m and b, the maximum allowed l_prev is floor( (k - b) / (n -m +1) ) - 1.

So, for each m and b, l_prev can be up to min(m, floor( (k - b) / (n -m +1) ) - 1 ). This can significantly reduce the possible l_prev values.

Let's see:

For m=1, n=2000, and k=2000:

n -m +1 = 2000 -1 +1 = 2000.

Contribution per l_prev is (l_prev+1) * 2000. For this to be <= k -b, which for b=0 is 2000.

So (l_prev+1) * 2000 <= 2000 → l_prev+1 <=1 → l_prev can be 0.

Thus, for m=1, only l_prev=0 is allowed when contributing.

Similarly, for m=2000, n-m+1 =1. The contribution is (l_prev+1) *1 <=k -b. So l_prev can be up to (k -b) -1. If k=2000 and b=0, then l_prev can be up to 1999. But since m=2000, l_prev can't exceed 2000-1=1999 (since run length is up to m-1). So in this case, l_prev can be up to 1999.

But this is still 2000 possible l_prev values for each m=2000 and b=0.

But the key is that for early m steps, the allowed l_prev values are very small. For example, when m is small, (n-m+1) is large, so (l_prev+1) must be <= (k -b)/(n-m+1). Since (n-m+1) is large, this division results in a small number, thus limiting l_prev.

So for steps where (n-m+1) is large, the possible l_prev values are limited, which can help reduce the state space.

Thus, even though the worst case is still O(n^2k), in practice, it's manageable for the given constraints.

So, the plan is to implement this DP with pruning of the l_prev values based on the remaining budget.

Now, let's proceed to code this.

The steps are:

1. Read n, k, and s.

2. Precompute for each position m (1-based) the counts of less, equal, greater.

3. Initialize the DP. We'll use a 2D array for the current state (l_prev, b) and update it for each step.

4. For each step m from 1 to n:

   a. Compute the current character's possible choices (less_count, equal_count, greater_count).

   b. For each possible (l_prev, b) in the current DP:

      i. If the current count is zero, skip.

      ii. Process the three choices:

         - Greater: compute contrib = (l_prev +1) * (n -m +1). If b + contrib >k, skip. Otherwise, add to the next state (0, b + contrib) with count * greater_count.

         - Equal: new_l = l_prev +1. Add to next state (new_l, b) with count * equal_count. But new_l can't exceed m (since for position m+1, the maximum run length is m+1 -1 = m).

         - Less: Add to next state (0, b) with count * less_count.

   c. After processing all current states, set the current DP to the next DP, and reset the next DP.

5. After processing all steps, sum all counts in states where the beauty is exactly k.

Now, implementing this in Python with 2D arrays and pruning is possible.

But handling the DP efficiently is key. We'll use a dictionary or a list of dictionaries to track the current states.

However, given the time constraints, using a list of lists (or a 2D array) for the current and next states is better.

But for space efficiency, we can represent the current DP as a dictionary where keys are tuples (l_prev, b), and values are counts. But in Python, dictionaries are slower than lists.

Another approach is to represent the current DP as a 2D list where dp_prev[l_prev][b] is the count.

But with l_prev up to m and b up to k, for each m, we can pre-allocate a 2D array of size (m+1) x (k+1). But for m up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this would require 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9 elements, which is impossible.

Thus, using a dictionary or defaultdict for each m is better.

But in Python, the way to handle this is to use dictionaries for the current and next states, which allows us to only track the (l_prev, b) pairs that are reachable and non-zero.

So, for each m, we'll use a dictionary (current_dp) where the keys are tuples (l_prev, b), and the values are counts modulo 1e9+7.

The steps in code:

- Initialize current_dp as {(0, 0): 1}.

- For each m in 1 to n:

   - Compute the current character's counts.

   - Initialize next_dp as defaultdict(int).

   - For each (l_prev, b) in current_dp:

      - count = current_dp[(l_prev, b)]

      - # Greater option

      contrib = (l_prev +1) * (n - m +1)

      new_b = b + contrib

      if new_b <=k:

          next_dp[(0, new_b)] = (next_dp[(0, new_b)] + count * greater_count) % MOD

      # Equal option

      new_l = l_prev + 1

      # new_l can't exceed m (since after processing m, the run length is new_l, which can be up to m (since m-1 +1 = m)

      next_dp[(new_l, b)] = (next_dp[(new_l, b)] + count * equal_count) % MOD

      # Less option

      next_dp[(0, b)] = (next_dp[(0, b)] + count * less_count) % MOD

   - Set current_dp to next_dp.

- After processing all m, sum all counts in current_dp where the b is k.

This approach uses dictionaries to track the states efficiently, only storing non-zero counts.

But for n=2000 and each m having a manageable number of states, this should work within the time constraints.

Testing this code against the sample input:

Sample 1:

n=2, k=2, s=yz.

Processing m=1 (character 'y'):

current_dp starts with {(0,0):1}.

For each (l_prev=0, b=0):

   greater_count is 25 - (121 - 97) = 25 - 24 = 1.

   contrib = (0+1)*2 = 2.

   new_b=0+2=2, which is <=k=2. So add to next_dp[(0, 2)] += 1 * 1 = 1.

   equal_count is 1. new_l=1. next_dp[(1,0)] += 1 *1 =1.

   less_count is 24 ( 'y' - 'a' = 24). next_dp[(0,0)] +=1 *24 =24.

So after m=1, next_dp has:

(0,2): 1

(1,0): 1

(0,0): 24

Processing m=2 (character 'z'):

For each state in current_dp (which is the next_dp from m=1):

Now, m=2, n -m +1 = 1.

For state (0,2):

   greater_count = 25 - (122-97) = 25 -25 =0. So no contribution.

   equal_count=1.

   contrib for greater is (0+1)*1=1. new_b=2+1=3 >k=2, so skipped.

   equal: new_l=0+1=1. Add to next_dp[(1,2)] +=1 *1=1.

   less_count is 25 ( 'z' - 'a' =25). Add to next_dp[(0,2)] +=1 *25=25.

For state (1,0):

   contrib for greater is (1+1)*1=2. new_b=0+2=2.

   greater_count is 0. So contribution is 0. So no addition.

   equal: new_l=1+1=2. Add to next_dp[(2,0)] +=1 *1=1.

   less_count is 25. Add to next_dp[(0,0)] +=1 *25=25.

For state (0,0):

   contrib for greater is (0+1)*1=1. new_b=0+1=1.

   greater_count is 0. So no contribution.

   equal: new_l=0+1=1. Add to next_dp[(1,0)] +=24 *1=24.

   less_count is 25. Add to next_dp[(0,0)] +=24 *25=600.

So after m=2:

next_dp has:

From (0,2) in m=1:

   (1,2):1 (equal) → but equal_count for 'z' is 1.

   (0,2):25 (less).

From (1,0) in m=1:

   (2,0):1 (equal).

   (0,0):25 (less).

From (0,0) in m=1:

   (1,0):24 (equal).

   (0,0):600 (less).

Now, after processing m=2, the next_dp is:

- (1,2): 1 (from (0,2) equal choice).

- (0,2):25 (from (0,2) less choice).

- (2,0):1.

- (0,0):25 + 600 =625.

- (1,0):24.

- (0,0) from (0,0) in m=1's less choice: 24*25=600.

Wait, perhaps the code would track all these.

But the beauty k=2 is achieved in the states (1,2) and (0,2) (from m=2 processing).

So the sum is 1 (from (1,2)) plus 25 (from (0,2)) → 26, which matches the sample output.

Thus, the code seems correct.

So the plan is to implement this approach using dictionaries for current and next states, and pruning transitions where the contribution exceeds k.

Now, the code.

We need to read n, k, s. Compute for each character in s the counts for less, equal, greater. Then process each position, updating the DP as described.

The code will look like this:

Testing against sample inputs 1, 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 +7

    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n")

    current_dp = {(0, 0): 1}

    for m in range(1, n+1):
        char = s[m-1]
        ord_char = ord(char) - ord('a')
        less = ord_char
        equal = 1
        greater = 25 - ord_char

        next_dp = dict()

        for (l_prev, b), cnt in current_dp.items():
            # Greater option
            contrib = (l_prev +1) * (n - m +1)
            new_b = b + contrib
            if new_b <= k:
                key = (0, new_b)
                next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * greater) % MOD

            # Equal option
            new_l = l_prev +1
            key = (new_l, b)
            next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * equal) % MOD

            # Less option
            key = (0, b)
            next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * less) % MOD

        current_dp = next_dp

    # Sum all counts where b ==k
    result = 0
    for (l, b), cnt in current_dp.items():
        if b ==k:
            result = (result + cnt) % MOD

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 3:

Input:

4 7

abcd

Output:21962.

Thus, the code should handle these cases.

Potential optimizations:

- Using defaultdict with int for next_dp to avoid checking for key existence.

But in the current code, using get and setting the key directly is efficient.

Thus, the code should work.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

current_dp = {(0, 0): 1}

for m in range(1, n + 1):
    char = s[m - 1]
    ord_char = ord(char) - ord('a')
    less = ord_char
    equal = 1
    greater = 25 - ord_char

    next_dp = {}

    for (l_prev, b), cnt in current_dp.items():
        # Greater choice
        contribution = (l_prev + 1) * (n - m + 1)
        new_b = b + contribution
        if new_b <= k:
            key = (0, new_b)
            next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * greater) % MOD

        # Equal choice
        new_l = l_prev + 1
        key = (new_l, b)
        next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * equal) % MOD

        # Less choice
        key = (0, b)
        next_dp[key] = (next_dp.get(key, 0) + cnt * less) % MOD

    current_dp = next_dp

result = sum(cnt for (_, b), cnt in current_dp.items() if b == k) % MOD
print(result)
```
