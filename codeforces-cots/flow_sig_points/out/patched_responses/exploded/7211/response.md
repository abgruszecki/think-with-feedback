<think>
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about finding the maximum possible value of c, which is the number of distinct prefixes that are present in at least one of the k strings written by the Fair Nut. These strings all lie between s and t lexicographically. We need to maximize c given that we can choose exactly k strings in that range.

Hmm. So the first thing I need to understand is how the prefixes contribute to c. Each string contributes all of its prefixes. But since c counts each distinct prefix once, the total is the union of all prefixes of the selected strings. So the goal is to choose k strings between s and t such that their prefixes cover as many different strings as possible.

The key here is to model the problem in terms of the trie structure. Each string's prefixes are the nodes along its path from the root to the leaf in the trie. The total number of nodes in the trie (counting all prefixes of all selected strings) would be the value of c. So the problem reduces to selecting k strings between s and t such that their combined trie has as many nodes as possible.

But how do we compute this efficiently? Let's think about the structure of the lex order between s and t. The strings allowed are all those in [s, t]. The maximum c is achieved by choosing the k strings that contribute the most unique prefixes. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to select the first k strings in the range, but maybe that's not always the case. Wait, but maybe the maximum c is achieved by selecting the first and last strings, and then some in between, to cover as many branches as possible in the trie.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal c is the sum of the number of nodes in the trie formed by the minimal set of strings that cover all possible branches. For example, if the range from s to t includes all possible a's followed by anything, then selecting the leftmost and rightmost would include all possible prefixes.

But how do we model this?

Another approach is to find all possible prefixes that are present in the range [s, t], and then see how many of those can be covered with k strings. However, even that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the union of all possible prefixes in the entire interval [s, t], and then the maximum c is the size of that union. But if the entire interval is covered with more than k strings, then we can only take a subset. But maybe the entire interval's union is possible with k=1. Like, if the entire interval is covered by a single string's prefixes, then c would be n. But if the interval includes multiple branches, then taking multiple strings would add more prefixes.

So the problem is to select k strings in [s, t] such that the union of their prefixes is as large as possible.

Let me think of some examples.

In the first example, n=2, k=4. s is "aa", t is "bb". The strings allowed are all 4 possible 2-letter strings (since aa, ab, ba, bb). Choosing all four gives all possible prefixes: a, aa, aab (wait, no, the prefixes are of each string. Each 2-length string contributes three prefixes: the empty string (maybe not?), the first character, and the entire string. Wait, the problem says "prefixes of at least one of the written strings". So for each written string, all of its prefixes (from length 1 up to n). So in the first example, the four strings are aa, ab, ba, bb. Their prefixes are:

aa: a, aa

ab: a, ab

ba: b, ba

bb: b, bb

So the union is a, aa, ab, b, ba, bb. Total of 6. So the empty string is not considered? Because the problem says "prefixes of at least one of the written strings", but the written strings have length n. So each string of length m contributes m prefixes (length 1 to m). But since n is given as the length of the strings written, then each written string has exactly n prefixes (length 1 to n). Wait, no: the problem states that the written strings are of length n. So each written string has n prefixes (each of length 1, 2, ..., n). So for a written string of length 2, like "aa", the prefixes are "a" and "aa".

So for the first example, the total c is 6. So that's the sum of all the possible 1 and 2-length prefixes in all four strings. But the union is the unique ones.

So the problem is to select k strings in the [s, t] interval such that their combined prefixes are as many as possible.

The approach here is to model the prefixes that can be formed by the selected strings, and find the maximum possible count.

But how do we compute this efficiently given the constraints (n up to 5e5, k up to 1e9)?

Hmm, perhaps the key is to model the problem as the union of the intervals of all possible prefixes in the [s, t] range, and then find how many of those can be covered by at most k strings in a way that maximizes the coverage.

Wait, but the selected strings are within [s, t], and each contributes their own prefixes. So the union of their prefixes is the total c.

The maximum possible c would be the number of all possible prefixes that appear in any string in [s, t]. But if the entire interval can be covered with k strings, then c is the total possible. However, if the interval is so large that even the minimal number of strings required to cover all possible prefixes is larger than k, then we have to choose a subset of those, selecting the ones that contribute the most new prefixes.

So the problem is similar to covering a trie with paths (strings) such that the total number of nodes (prefixes) is maximized, using at most k paths.

This is similar to the set cover problem, but since we can select up to k sets (strings) and the universe is all possible prefixes in [s, t], but the problem is to maximize the union. However, set cover is NP-hard, but here the structure of the problem allows a greedy approach.

But with the problem constraints, we need an O(n) solution.

Alternative approach: The maximum number of prefixes is the sum of the number of unique prefixes that can be obtained by selecting k strings in the range [s, t]. So the problem reduces to finding how many distinct prefixes exist in the entire [s, t] range, and how many of them can be covered with k strings.

But how?

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: the entire [s, t] interval forms a certain set of possible prefixes. For each possible prefix length l (from 1 to n), how many distinct prefixes of length l exist in [s, t]? The sum of these across l gives the maximum possible c (if k is large enough). However, if the number of required strings to cover all those prefixes is more than k, then we have to choose the best k strings (or arrange the selection such that the sum of the maximum possible prefixes is achieved with k strings).

Wait, perhaps each prefix contributes some number of "nodes" to the c. The problem is to select k strings such that the sum of the nodes (prefixes) they cover is as large as possible, but the union is the sum of the unique ones.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the trie structure.

Each string in [s, t] corresponds to a path from the root to a leaf in the trie. The union of all their paths gives the trie, and the total number of nodes (excluding the root?) is the maximum possible c. However, if we can select k such paths that cover as many nodes as possible, that's our answer.

But how do we model this? The maximum c is the number of nodes in the trie formed by the entire [s, t] interval. But if the number of nodes is such that the minimal number of strings needed to cover all nodes is <= k, then the answer is the sum of all nodes. Otherwise, we need to select k paths that cover as many nodes as possible.

But how do we compute the minimal number of strings required to cover all possible nodes in the trie of [s, t], and then determine if k is sufficient?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the sum of the number of possible prefixes for each level l (from 1 to n), but capped by some function of k. For example, at each level l, the number of distinct prefixes in [s, t] is some value, but the number of strings that can contribute to that level may depend on how many branches we have.

Wait, perhaps this can be broken down into each position in the string. For each position l (from 1 to n), the number of possible choices for the first l characters, given that the entire string is in [s, t]. Then, the sum of these over l is the maximum possible c. But if the number of required strings to cover all these possibilities is <=k, then that's the answer. Otherwise, we need to find a way to select k strings to maximize the sum of the distinct prefixes.

But how does the selection of k strings affect the coverage of these prefixes?

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible c is the sum for each l from 1 to n of the minimum between the number of distinct prefixes of length l in [s, t] and the number of such prefixes that can be covered by k strings. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the maximum possible c is the sum over l from 1 to n of the number of distinct prefixes of length l that exist in the entire [s, t] interval. Because each such prefix can be covered by at least one string in the interval, so if we can select enough strings to cover all these, then the sum is the answer. But if the number of required strings is larger than k, then we can't cover all and need to find a way to maximize the sum.

But how to model that?

Hmm, perhaps for each possible prefix of length l, if there exists a string in the interval that starts with that prefix, then it's counted. So the maximum possible c is the total number of distinct prefixes of all lengths present in the interval [s, t]. Then, the problem becomes: how many strings do we need to cover all of these prefixes? If that number is <=k, then answer is the sum. Otherwise, we need to select the most "efficient" strings in terms of covering new prefixes.

But how do we compute the minimal number of strings needed to cover all the prefixes in [s, t]? For example, in the first sample, all 4 strings are needed to cover all 6 prefixes, but maybe in some cases, a single string can cover all prefixes.

Alternatively, think of the interval [s, t] as a binary trie. The minimal number of strings needed to cover all possible prefixes is the number of leaves in the trie. Each leaf is a path from root to a node of length n, and each such leaf represents a string. But the trie structure would have some branches. The minimal number of strings to cover all possible prefixes is the number of leaves in the trie. Because each leaf (string) covers all prefixes along its path. So if the interval [s, t] has m leaves (strings), then the minimal number of strings needed to cover all possible prefixes is m. So if k >= m, then the answer is the sum of all possible prefixes (for each l, the count of distinct prefixes at that level in [s, t]). But if k < m, then we can't cover all, and need to find the maximum coverage possible by selecting k leaves in the trie.

But how to compute this?

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using a trie structure. However, given that n can be up to 5e5, building an explicit trie is impossible. So we need an efficient way to compute the required values without building the trie.

Alternative approach: compute the number of distinct prefixes for each level l in [s, t], and then find how many of these can be covered with k strings.

But again, how?

Wait, perhaps the total number of distinct prefixes in [s, t] is equal to the sum over l from 1 to n of (the number of distinct prefixes of length l in the interval). Let's denote this sum as total_c. Then, if the minimal number of strings required to cover all these prefixes is m, then:

if k >= m, the answer is total_c.

if k < m, the answer is the sum of the first k strings' contributions when selecting the strings that cover the most new prefixes each.

But how to compute m and the sum when k < m.

Alternatively, for each l from 1 to n, the number of prefixes of length l is the number of possible choices in the first l characters such that the entire string is between s and t. Let's compute for each l the count of possible prefixes. Then, the total_c is the sum of all these counts.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Additionally, the minimal number of strings required to cover all these prefixes is the number of leaves in the trie of [s, t]. Each leaf is a string in [s, t], and each string covers exactly the prefixes along its path. The minimal number of strings is the number of leaves. So if the number of leaves is m, then:

if k >= m: answer is total_c.

if k < m: then we need to select k leaves such that their paths cover as many nodes as possible. But how?

Alternatively, when the minimal number of leaves m is larger than k, the best way to maximize the sum is to select the first k leaves, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum when k < m is the sum of all possible prefixes up to a certain depth, and then for the remaining, select k strings that cover as much as possible.

But this is getting a bit stuck.

Let me think of the problem differently. Let's compute two things:

1. The total number of distinct prefixes in [s, t]. Let's call this total_c.

2. The minimal number of strings m required to cover all these prefixes.

If k >= m, then the answer is total_c. Otherwise, the answer is total_c minus the sum of the (m -k) least contributing prefixes. But this is probably not correct.

Alternatively, when m > k, we need to select k strings such that their coverage is maximized. The maximum possible coverage would be the total_c minus the minimal possible sum of nodes not covered. But this is unclear.

Wait, but perhaps the way to maximize the coverage is to select the k strings that each contribute as many new nodes as possible. So the greedy approach would be to select the strings that have the longest possible unique branches.

But how to model this in terms of the given s and t.

Alternatively, think of the interval [s, t] as a binary tree, where each node represents a prefix. The leaves are the strings in [s, t]. The problem is to select k leaves such that the union of their paths covers as many nodes as possible.

The maximum possible coverage is achieved by selecting the leaves that are as spread out as possible. For example, choosing the leftmost and rightmost leaves would cover the most nodes.

But again, how to compute this.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows:

The interval [s, t] can be represented as a range of binary numbers (a=0, b=1). The number of leaves (strings) in the interval is m. If m <=k, then all prefixes are covered, so the answer is the sum of the number of distinct prefixes at each level l. Otherwise, when m >k, we need to select k leaves such that their coverage is maximized.

The key is that when m >k, the maximum coverage is the sum of the prefixes covered by the entire interval minus the number of prefixes that can only be covered by the leaves not selected. But how to find that.

Alternatively, each additional string (leaf) after the first few contributes some new nodes. For example, the first string contributes n nodes. The second string may diverge from the first at some level l, contributing (n - l +1) new nodes. The third string may diverge from the existing paths at some level, etc.

But with m up to 2^5e5, which is way too big, we can't process each string.

So perhaps the problem requires a way to compute the minimal number of strings required to cover all possible prefixes, and if k is larger than that, return the total_c. Otherwise, find a way to compute the maximum coverage with k strings.

But how?

Alternatively, the minimal number of strings needed to cover all prefixes in the interval [s, t] is equal to the number of branching points in the interval. For example, in the first sample, the interval includes all possible two-letter strings, so the minimal number of strings required to cover all prefixes is 4. But that's exactly the number of leaves (m=4). So in this case, if k >=4, answer is 6.

But how to compute m?

Wait, m is simply the number of strings in the interval [s, t]. Because each string is a leaf in the trie. So m is the count of strings between s and t, inclusive.

Wait, but if s and t are such that there are a lot of strings between them (like, up to 2^n), then m could be up to 1e9 or even 1e18, but k is up to 1e9. So if m <=k, then the answer is the sum of all possible prefixes. Otherwise, when m >k, then we need to choose k strings to cover as many prefixes as possible.

But how to compute the sum when m >k.

Hmm. Let's first find out m, the number of strings in [s, t]. Then:

If m <=k: answer is sum of the number of distinct prefixes of each length l (from 1 to n).

Else: answer is sum of all distinct prefixes minus the minimal possible number of prefixes that can't be covered by any k strings.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, when m >k, the maximum coverage is the sum of the number of distinct prefixes minus the sum of the (m -k) * ... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy when m exceeds k is to select the first k strings in the interval. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, maybe selecting the first and last strings would cover more prefixes.

Wait, let's take the third example:

Input:

4 5

abbb

baaa

So s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa'. But since s is lex <= t, but in this case, abbb is lex smaller than baaa. So the interval includes all strings from abbb to baaa.

But wait, what is the lex order here? Let's see:

abbb comes before abba? No, wait, the first position where s and t differ is the first character. s starts with 'a', t with 'b'. So the interval is all strings starting with 'a' followed by any combination (since s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa'), but wait, that's not possible. Because 'abbb' is lex smaller than 'baaa', but any string starting with 'a' is lex smaller than any string starting with 'b'. So the interval [s, t] includes all strings starting with 'a' and with length 4 (if s is the smallest such) up to the maximum 'a' string (aaaa?), and also all strings starting with 'b' up to 'baaa'? Wait, no. Because s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa'. So the interval includes all strings from 'abbb' to 'baaa' in lex order.

But that's possible only if the first character is 'a' followed by something, or 'b' followed by something. But 'abbb' is lex less than 'baaa' because the first character is 'a' vs 'b'.

So the interval includes:

- All strings starting with 'a' and >= 'abbb' (since they are lex >= s).

- All strings starting with 'b' and <= 'baaa' (since they are lex <= t).

Wait, no. The lex order is such that the entire first group is strings starting with 'a' and >= 'abbb', followed by all strings starting with 'b' and <= 'baaa'. For example, the string 'abbb' is the first, then 'abba' would be lex smaller than 'abbb' but not in the interval. So the interval is the set of all strings between 'abbb' and 'baaa', inclusive. But since the first character of 'abbb' is 'a' and that of 'baaa' is 'b', all strings starting with 'a' that are >= 'abbb' and all strings starting with 'b' that are <= 'baaa' are included.

So the number of strings in the interval is (number of 'a' strings >= 'abbb') + (number of 'b' strings <= 'baaa').

But how to compute this.

But perhaps for the purpose of solving the problem, we need to compute the number of strings in the interval [s, t], which is m. If m <=k, then the answer is the sum of all distinct prefixes in the interval. Otherwise, when m >k, the answer is sum of all distinct prefixes minus something. But how?

Alternatively, when m exceeds k, the maximum c is the sum of all distinct prefixes minus the sum of (m -k) * (some value), but this is not clear.

Alternatively, the problem can be split into two parts:

1. Compute the total number of distinct prefixes in [s, t], which is total_c.

2. Compute the minimal number of strings required to cover all these prefixes, which is m.

If k >= m, then answer is total_c. Otherwise, the answer is total_c - (m -k) * 1. But this is not necessarily true.

Alternatively, when m >k, the maximum number of prefixes is total_c - (m -k). But this would imply that each additional string beyond k contributes 1 to the sum. But in reality, each new string can contribute more than 1.

Hmm. Let's look at the third example. The input is:

4 5

abbb

baaa

The output is 8.

The explanation says that there are only two different strings that Nut could write. So m=2. Since k=5, which is >=2, the answer is the sum of all distinct prefixes in the interval.

The sum for each l:

l=1: 'a' and 'b' are both present. So count 2.

l=2: for l=2, the prefixes could be 'ab', 'aa' (if there are any strings starting with 'a' after 'abbb' that have aa as the first two characters), but perhaps in this case, the interval includes only the strings 'abbb' and 'baaa'.

Wait, wait, let's see. The interval is from 'abbb' to 'baaa'. Let's compute the possible strings in between:

'abbb' is the first. Then, any 'a' followed by three 'b's? Or perhaps 'abbb' is the only 'a' string in the interval. Because the next possible 'a' string would be 'abba', but that's lex smaller than 'abbb', so not included. Wait, no. The interval includes all strings between s and t. So 'abbb' is the start. The next possible string after 'abbb' would be 'abba', but since 'abbb' is the start, and the interval is [s, t], which includes s and t. So any string >= s and <= t.

But 'abba' is lex smaller than 'abbb', so it's not included. So the only 'a' string in the interval is 'abbb'?

Then, the next string after 'abbb' is 'abba'? No, wait, no. Let's think about the binary representation. Let's consider 'a' as 0 and 'b' as 1. Then, the strings are in binary order. For example, 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1. For two characters, 'aa' is 00, 'ab' is 01, 'ba' is 10, 'bb' is 11. So the lex order is correct.

The string 'abbb' is 0 followed by 111. The next possible string after that would be 0 followed by 111 +1. But since the length is 4, 'abbb' is 0 followed by 111 (binary 7). Adding 1 would be 1000, which is 8 in binary. So the next string is 'baaa' (1 followed by 000). But that's larger than 'baaa' (the t is 'baaa')?

Wait, no. The t is 'baaa', which is '1000' in binary. So 'abbb' is 0111 (binary) and 'baaa' is 1000. So the interval between them is exactly two strings: 'abbb' and 'baaa'. So m=2. Hence, if k=5, which is >=2, then all possible prefixes are covered.

The sum of the prefixes:

For 'abbb' (a, ab, abb, abbb).

For 'baaa' (b, ba, baa, baaa).

So the union is a, ab, abb, abbb; b, ba, baa, baaa. So total 4 +4=8. Which matches the sample output.

So in this case, the sum of the distinct prefixes is 8.

But how to compute this sum programmatically.

So the first step is to compute for each l from 1 to n the number of distinct prefixes of length l in the interval [s, t].

Let's denote this count as cl for each l.

Then, the total_c is sum cl for l from 1 to n.

Now, to compute cl for each l.

How to find cl for each l?

For a given l, the possible prefixes of length l are all the prefixes of strings in [s, t]. So the cl is the number of distinct prefixes of length l that appear in any string between s and t.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Let's think of the lex range [s, t], and for each l, find the minimal and maximal possible prefix of length l in the interval. Then, the number of distinct prefixes of length l in the interval is the number of possible prefixes between the minimal and maximal, including all possible a's and b's in between.

Wait, but the minimal and maximal prefix at level l may not be contiguous. For example, there might be a range where some prefixes are allowed and others are not. However, considering that all strings in [s, t] are between s and t, any prefix of a string in the interval is a prefix that is >= s's prefix up to l characters and <= t's prefix up to l characters.

Wait, perhaps not. Because a string in the interval may have a prefix of length l that is between s's prefix and t's prefix. For example, consider l=1: the first character of s is 'a', and first character of t is 'b'. Then, all possible prefixes of length 1 are 'a' and 'b', so cl=2.

Wait, but how to compute the minimal and maximal prefix of length l for the interval.

But the minimal prefix of length l in the interval is the minimal prefix of any string in [s, t], which would be the prefix of s up to l characters, but possibly extended if s's prefix is not the minimal. Wait, perhaps not. For example, if s is 'ab', and l=1, then the minimal prefix is 'a', but if s is 'ba', and the interval includes 'aa', then the minimal prefix is 'a' even though s's first character is 'b'. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, the minimal prefix for length l is the minimal possible prefix of length l among all strings in [s, t]. Similarly for the maximal.

But how to compute this?

Alternatively, for a given l, the minimal possible prefix is the prefix of the minimal string in the interval. The maximal prefix is the prefix of the maximal string in the interval. Then, the number of prefixes of length l in the interval is the number of strings between these two prefixes (inclusive) of length l.

But this is only true if all prefixes between the minimal and maximal are present in the interval. However, this is not the case.

For example, consider l=2, and the interval is ['abbb', 'baaa']. The minimal prefix is 'ab' (from 'abbb') and the maximal is 'ba' (from 'baaa'). So between 'ab' and 'ba', there are prefixes like 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb'? No, 'ab' comes before 'ba', but any string starting with 'ab' is between 'abbb' and 'baaa'. So for l=2, the prefixes are 'ab' (from 'abbb'), and 'ba' (from 'baaa'). Are there any other prefixes of length 2 in the interval?

No. Because any string starting with 'ab' has prefix 'ab' for l=2. The 'abbb' is the only 'a' string in the interval. For the 'b' strings, the minimal is 'baaa', which has prefix 'ba' for l=2. So for l=2, the prefixes are 'ab' and 'ba', so cl=2.

But according to the sample input, for l=2, the count is 2.

But how to compute this.

So the problem is to find for each l the number of possible prefixes of length l that can appear in any string in [s, t].

But how?

Alternative approach:

The minimal and maximal possible prefixes of length l in the interval [s, t] can be found by the following method:

The minimal prefix is the minimal between the first l characters of s and the first l characters of the minimal string in the entire interval.

Wait, perhaps the minimal prefix of length l in the interval is the minimal possible prefix of length l among all strings >= s and <=t.

But how to compute that.

Alternatively, the minimal prefix of length l is the minimal possible string of length l that is a prefix of any string in the interval [s, t]. Similarly for the maximal.

But again, how to compute this.

Another idea: for each l, the minimal prefix is the minimum between the prefix of s up to l and the prefix of t up to l. Wait, but not necessarily. For example, if s is 'aab', t is 'abb', then for l=2, the prefixes of s and t are 'aa' and 'ab' respectively. So the minimal is 'aa', maximal is 'ab'. So the count is the number of prefixes between 'aa' and 'ab', which is 2 (aa, ab).

But if the interval includes 'aab' and 'abb', then any string between them must start with 'aa' (if the first two characters are 'aa') or 'ab' (if the first two characters are 'ab').

So for l=2, the count is 2.

But perhaps this is the case in general. For each l, the minimal prefix is the minimal between s's prefix and the prefix of the minimal string in the interval. Similarly for the maximal. But this seems tricky.

Alternatively, the minimal prefix for l is the minimal possible between the prefix of s and the prefix of t, adjusted based on the possible prefixes of the entire interval.

Alternatively, let's consider that the minimal prefix for l is the minimum of the first l characters of s and the first l characters of the first string in the interval that starts with the minimal possible prefix of length l.

But I'm not sure.

Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimal and maximal prefixes for each l by considering the entire interval.

For a given l, let's compute the minimal possible prefix of length l that can appear in the interval [s, t], and the maximal possible prefix. Then, the number of distinct prefixes of length l is the number of possible prefixes between these two, inclusive.

But how to compute these min and max prefixes.

Let's think of the interval [s, t]. For a given l, the minimal prefix of length l is the minimal possible prefix of any string in the interval. Similarly for the maximal.

The minimal prefix would be the prefix of s if s is the first string in the interval. But wait, for example, if s is 'ab' and the interval includes 'aab', then the minimal prefix for l=2 would be 'aa', which is smaller than 'ab'.

But in this case, the entire interval is s= 'ab' to t='something'? No, because if s is 'ab', then any string in the interval must be >= 'ab'. So 'aab' is less than 'ab' and thus not in the interval. So the minimal string in the interval is s, and the maximal is t.

So for any string in the interval, the first l characters must be >= the first l characters of s, and <= the first l characters of t.

So, for each l, the minimal possible prefix is the first l characters of s, but only if there exists a string in the interval with that prefix. Otherwise, it's higher.

Similarly, the maximal possible prefix is the first l characters of t, but only if there exists a string in the interval with that prefix. Otherwise, it's lower.

Wait, but how to find the minimal and maximal prefixes.

Let me try to model this.

For a given l:

The minimal prefix is the first l characters of s, but perhaps there are strings in the interval that start with a prefix lex smaller than s's prefix. But no, because the interval is [s, t], so all strings in the interval are >= s. So the minimal prefix for any l is the first l characters of s, unless s's prefix up to l is not the minimal possible. But since s is the minimal string in the interval, any prefix of s up to l is the minimal possible prefix.

Wait, no. For example, s is 'ab', which is lex greater than 'aa'. But since the interval starts with 'ab', there are no strings in the interval with a prefix of 'aa'. So for l=2, the minimal prefix is 'ab'.

Similarly, the maximal prefix for l is the first l characters of t.

But this is only true if there exists a string in the interval with that prefix.

For example, consider the third sample where s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa'. For l=1, s's first character is 'a' and t's is 'b'. So the minimal prefix is 'a', maximal is 'b', so the count is 2.

For l=2, the first two characters of s are 'ab', and of t are 'ba'. So the minimal possible prefix is 'ab' and the maximal is 'ba'.

But are there any strings in the interval with prefixes between 'ab' and 'ba' (exclusive)?

Well, 'ab' is the prefix of s. 'ba' is the prefix of t. But between them, any prefix like 'ac' (but 'c' is not part of the alphabet). Or 'a' followed by something higher than 'b'? Wait, the alphabet is only 'a' and 'b'. So 'ab' is the minimal possible prefix for l=2 in the interval. The maximal is 'ba'.

But what about strings like 'abba'? Wait, 'abbb' is the first string in the interval, so any string in the interval must be >= 'abbb'. So the prefix of length 2 for any string in the interval must be 'ab' (since the first character is 'a', and the second is 'b' in 'abbb') or higher. But 'ab' is the only possible two-character prefix for strings starting with 'a', since the next character after 'ab' would be 'b' followed by other 'b's. So for the 'a' part of the interval, all strings start with 'ab', and then the third character is 'b's. For the 'b' part of the interval, the prefix is 'ba'.

So for l=2, the prefixes are 'ab' and 'ba', hence cl=2.

So for each l, the minimal and maximal prefixes are the first l characters of s and t, respectively. But this is only true if s's first l characters are lex <= t's first l characters. Otherwise, there are no prefixes for that l.

Wait, no. If s's prefix is larger than t's prefix, then there are no strings in the interval with that l-length prefix. So the count cl is zero.

But since s is lex <= t, for each l, the first l characters of s are lex <= the first l characters of t. So the prefixes for each l form a range from the s's l-prefix to t's l-prefix.

So for each l, the minimal prefix is the first l characters of s, and the maximal is the first l characters of t. Then, the number of distinct prefixes of length l in the interval is the number of distinct strings between these two prefixes (inclusive), considering only the first l characters.

But how to compute the number of distinct strings between two prefixes of length l.

For example, between 'ab' (l=2) and 'ba' (l=2), how many possible prefixes are there?

Each character can be 'a' or 'b'. So 'ab' is 0 followed by 1 (if 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1). 'ba' is 10 in binary. The number of possible prefixes between 'ab' (01) and 'ba' (10) is 01, 10. So count is 2.

But how to compute this in general.

Another example: s's prefix is 'aab', t's prefix is 'abb' for l=3. So the minimal is 'aab', maximal is 'abb'. How many possible prefixes are there between them?

In binary terms, 'aab' is 001, 'abb' is 011. So the numbers from 1 (binary 001) to 3 (binary 011). So 001, 010, 011. So count is 3.

So the number of distinct prefixes between s_l and t_l is (value of t_l - s_l + 1) if s_l <= t_l. Otherwise, zero.

But how to calculate the numeric value of a prefix.

So the approach would be:

For each l from 1 to n:

1. Compute s_l = s[0..l-1]

2. Compute t_l = t[0..l-1]

3. Compute the numeric value of s_l and t_l, considering 'a' as 0 and 'b' as 1.

4. If s_l > t_l: then there are no prefixes of length l in the interval. So cl=0.

5. Else: the number of cl is (numeric value of t_l - numeric value of s_l + 1).

But wait, this is not correct. Because the numeric values of the prefixes may not be consecutive. For example, if s_l is 'ab' (01) and t_l is 'ba' (10), then the numeric values are 1 and 2. So 2 - 1 +1=2, which matches the count.

Another example: s_l is 'aab' (001=1), t_l is 'abb' (011=3). 3-1 +1=3, which is correct.

Another example: s_l is 'aaa', t_l is 'aab'. Then the numeric value is 0 and 1, so count is 2.

So the formula seems to work.

But how to compute the numeric value of a prefix.

Each prefix of length l can be represented as a binary number of l bits, where 'a' is 0 and 'b' is 1. For example, 'ab' is 0 followed by 1 → 01 → 1 in decimal.

So for each l, we need to compute the binary value of s's prefix and t's prefix.

Once we have these two values, if s_val > t_val, cl is zero. Otherwise, cl is t_val - s_val + 1.

But wait, what if the entire interval has strings that have prefixes between s_l and t_l, but the actual prefixes in the interval are not contiguous. For example, if the interval for l is such that there are some prefixes between s_l and t_l that are not present in any string of the interval.

But according to our previous reasoning, the interval [s, t] includes all strings between s and t. So any prefix that is between s_l and t_l (inclusive) is present in some string in the interval. For example, any prefix of length l between s_l and t_l is the prefix of the string that is formed by that prefix followed by the minimal possible suffix (all 'a's) or maximal possible suffix (all 'b's), depending on whether the prefix is s_l or t_l.

Wait, but this is not necessarily the case. For example, the prefix 'ab' (for l=2) may be in the interval, but the string 'abaa' may not be in the interval because it's lex smaller than s.

Hmm, this is a problem. For example, let's say s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa'. For l=2, the prefixes are 'ab' and 'ba'. But the string 'abaa' is not in the interval because it's lex smaller than 'abbb'. So the prefix 'ab' is allowed only if there exists at least one string in the interval with that prefix. But the only string with prefix 'ab' in the interval is 'abbb', so the prefix 'ab' is included. So cl is 2 in this case.

But according to the formula, s_l is 'ab' (binary 01 → 1), t_l is 'ba' (binary 10 → 2). So the count is 2-1+1=2, which is correct.

But how to ensure that the prefixes between s_l and t_l are all present in the interval.

Let's think of a string with a prefix of length l equal to some value between s_l and t_l. Can we find a string in the interval [s, t] that has this prefix?

Yes. Because if the prefix is between s_l and t_l, then the string formed by that prefix followed by the minimal possible suffix (e.g., all 'a's) may be >= s and <= t.

Wait, for example, suppose the prefix is P, which is between s_l and t_l. Then, the string P followed by 'a's (to make the suffix as small as possible) may be >= s, and P followed by 'b's (to make the suffix as large as possible) may be <= t.

But this depends on the original s and t.

Alternatively, the prefix P is between s_l and t_l. Then, the minimal string with prefix P is P followed by all 'a's (of length n-l). The maximal string with prefix P is P followed by all 'b's.

To have a string in the interval [s, t], we need that this minimal string <= t and the maximal string >= s.

But since P is between s_l and t_l, perhaps there exists at least one string with prefix P in the interval.

But how to confirm this.

Alternatively, since the prefix P is between s_l and t_l, the minimal string with prefix P (P followed by 'a's) must be <= t, and the maximal string with prefix P (P followed by 'b's) must be >= s.

Wait, no. For example, suppose P is s_l. Then, the minimal string with prefix P is s itself (if P is exactly s_l). But if s is 'abbb', then the minimal string with prefix 'ab' is 'abaaa' (but since the length is 4, it's 'abaa') which is lex smaller than 'abbb'. So this string would not be in the interval.

But the prefix 'ab' is part of the string 'abbb', which is in the interval.

Ah, right. So for a given prefix P of length l, if there exists any string in [s, t] with prefix P, then P is counted in cl.

But how to find whether P is present in the interval.

This complicates things. Because the initial formula (cl = t_val - s_val + 1) counts all prefixes between s_l and t_l, but some of these prefixes may not have any strings in the interval.

So the initial approach may overcount.

So the problem is to compute for each l the number of prefixes P of length l such that there exists at least one string in [s, t] with prefix P.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This seems very challenging. Let's think of how to model this.

For each l, the minimal possible prefix of length l in the interval is the minimal prefix of any string in [s, t]. This is the minimal possible P such that there exists a string in [s, t] with prefix P.

Similarly, the maximal prefix is the maximal P such that there exists a string in [s, t] with prefix P.

But how to compute these min and max.

An alternative idea: the minimal prefix for l is the first l characters of the minimal string in [s, t], which is s. Similarly, the maximal prefix is the first l characters of t. However, this is only true if there exists a string in [s, t] with that prefix. Otherwise, we need to adjust.

Wait, but s is in the interval, so the prefix s_l exists. Similarly, t is in the interval, so the prefix t_l exists.

So the minimal possible prefix is s_l and the maximal is t_l.

Thus, the number of prefixes between s_l and t_l (inclusive) is the value computed by the formula, but only if all prefixes in between are possible.

But this is not the case. For example, consider s = 'abbb' and t = 'baaa' for l=3. The prefixes are 'abb' and 'baa'. The formula would compute t_val - s_val + 1. Let's compute s_val and t_val:

For 'abb' (l=3): 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'b' is 1. So binary 011 → 3.

For 'baa' (l=3): 'b' is 1, 'a' is 0, 'a' is 0 → binary 100 → 4.

So the formula gives 4-3+1=2. But are there any prefixes between 'abb' (3) and 'baa' (4)?

Yes, there's 3 (011), 4 (100), but nothing in between. So count is 2.

But in reality, the strings in the interval are 'abbb' and 'baaa'. The prefix 'abb' comes from 'abbb', and 'baa' comes from 'baaa'. Are there any other prefixes of length 3 in the interval?

No. Because the only 'a' string is 'abbb', so for l=3, the prefix is 'abb'. The 'b' strings are 'baaa', so the prefix is 'baa'. So the count is 2, which matches the formula.

So in this case, the formula works.

Another example: s is 'aab', t is 'abb' for l=3. So s_val is 0 (binary 001), t_val is 3 (binary 011). The count is 3-0+1=4. But possible prefixes are 'aab', 'aaa', 'aab', 'abb'? Wait, no. Wait, the prefix 'aab' is 001 → 1, 'aaa' is 000 → 0, 'aab' is 001 → 1, 'abb' is 011 → 3. So between 0 and 3, the possible prefixes are 0 (000), 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011). But the formula gives 3-0+1=4. However, the interval [s, t] includes strings between 'aab' and 'abb'. So the minimal string is 'aab', which has prefix 'aab' (001). The maximal string is 'abb' (011). So the possible prefixes of length 3 are 'aab' (001), 'aba' (010), 'abb' (011). So count is 3. But according to the formula, it's 3-0+1=4. But this is incorrect.

Wait, so in this example, s is 'aab' (001), t is 'abb' (011). The interval [s, t] includes all strings between 'aab' and 'abb', inclusive. For l=3, the possible prefixes of length 3 are 'aab', 'aab' (if the string is 'aab'), 'aab', 'aba' (if the string is 'aba'), 'abb' (if the string is 'abb'). So the prefixes are 'aab' (1), 'aba' (2), 'abb' (3). So count is 3.

But according to the formula, s_val is 1 (binary 001), t_val is 3 (binary 011). So 3-1+1=3, which is correct.

Ah, right. So I made a mistake in the previous example: s is 'aab', which is 001 (value 1), and t is 'abb' (011, value 3). So the formula gives 3-1+1=3, which matches the correct count.

So the formula works when s_l and t_l are correctly computed.

Thus, the formula for cl is:

cl = max(0, t_val - s_val + 1), where s_val is the numeric value of s's prefix of length l, and t_val is the numeric value of t's prefix of length l.

But how to compute s_val and t_val.

Each prefix is a binary number of l bits, where 'a' is 0 and 'b' is 1. For example, for 'ab', l=2: 0*2^(1) + 1*2^0 = 1.

So we can precompute for s and t the binary value for each possible l.

But how to do this efficiently.

We can precompute for each position l the binary value of the prefix up to that l for s and t.

For example, for s:

s_val = 0

prefix_s = [0]*(n+1)

for i in 0 to n-1:

    s_val = s_val * 2 + (s[i] == 'b')

    prefix_s[i+1] = s_val

Similarly for t.

But since n can be up to 5e5, this requires O(n) time, which is acceptable.

Once we have prefix_s and prefix_t, for each l, s_val is prefix_s[l], t_val is prefix_t[l].

Then, for each l, cl is max(0, t_val - prefix_s[l] + 1) if prefix_s[l] <= prefix_t[l], else 0.

But wait, the formula is cl = max(0, prefix_t[l] - prefix_s[l] + 1) if prefix_s[l] <= prefix_t[l].

So, for each l from 1 to n, compute cl as follows:

if prefix_s[l] > prefix_t[l]:

    cl = 0

else:

    cl = prefix_t[l] - prefix_s[l] + 1

Sum all cl to get total_c.

But this assumes that all prefixes between s's prefix and t's prefix are present in the interval. Which may not be the case.

But in the previous example where s is 'abbb' and t is 'baaa', the formula correctly computes cl=2 for l=2.

So why is this correct?

Because for any prefix P between s's prefix and t's prefix, there exists a string in the interval that has prefix P.

But how to confirm this.

Suppose for a given l, we have a prefix P such that s_l <= P <= t_l.

Can we construct a string in the interval [s, t] that has prefix P?

Yes.

The minimal string with prefix P is P followed by all 'a's (of length n-l).

The maximal string with prefix P is P followed by all 'b's.

We need to show that there exists at least one string in [s, t] between s and t that has prefix P.

For that, the minimal string with P must be <= t, and the maximal string with P must be >= s.

But since P is between s_l and t_l:

For the minimal string with P (P followed by 'a's):

- The prefix P is >= s_l. So the minimal string with P is >= s. Because s's first l characters are s_l, and if P >= s_l, then P followed by 'a's is >= s.

Because s is the minimal string in the interval.

Similarly, the maximal string with P (P followed by 'b's) must be <= t.

Because P <= t_l, and P followed by 'b's is <= t.

But why?

Because t's first l characters are t_l. So if P <= t_l, then P followed by 'b's is <= t. Because even if the next characters of t are 'a's, the maximal string with prefix P is P followed by 'b's, which is lex greater than any string with prefix P followed by 'a's.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, t's first l characters are t_l, but the rest of the characters could be 'a's. So the maximal string with prefix P would be P followed by 'b's, which could be larger than t.

Wait, this is a problem.

For example, suppose P is t_l. Then, the maximal string is P followed by 'b's. But if the actual t has some 'a's after the prefix, this string would be larger than t.

So in this case, the maximal string is not in the interval.

So the presence of a string with prefix P in the interval depends on whether the minimal string with P is <= t and the maximal string with P is >= s.

But how to model this.

The minimal string with P is P followed by 'a's. This must be <= t.

The maximal string with P is P followed by 'b's. This must be >= s.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, for a prefix P of length l:

P is between s_l and t_l.

We need to check if the minimal string with P (P + 'a'^(n-l)) <= t, and the maximal string with P (P + 'b'^(n-l)) >= s.

But for all l and P in between s_l and t_l, this is true?

Not necessarily. So the formula may overcount.

But how to handle this.

This seems to complicate the problem significantly, but given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial formula and compute cl as (prefix_t[l] - prefix_s[l] + 1), then compute m as the number of strings in the interval [s, t], and then the answer is total_c if k >= m, else total_c minus some value based on k.

But how to compute m.

The number of strings in the interval [s, t] can be computed as (numeric value of t) - (numeric value of s) + 1.

Because each string is a binary number of n bits, 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1. So the numeric value of s is vs, t is vt. The number of strings is vt - vs + 1, provided that s <= t.

But since the problem states that s is lex <= t, so this is valid.

So m = vt - vs + 1.

Now, the problem becomes:

Compute total_c as the sum of cl for l from 1 to n.

Compute m = vt - vs + 1.

If k >= m: output total_c.

Else: output total_c - (m -k) * 1.

Wait, no. Because when m exceeds k, the maximum possible c is the sum of all prefixes covered by the first k strings selected. But how to model this.

Alternatively, when m >k, the answer is the sum of cl for all l, minus the sum of the number of prefixes that are only covered by the (m -k) strings not selected.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows:

The total_c is the sum of all prefixes in the entire interval. But when we select k strings, each string contributes exactly n prefixes. But because prefixes are shared among strings, the total_c is the sum of the unique prefixes.

But how to model the contribution of each string.

This seems intractable.

Another observation: when m >k, the maximal possible c is the sum of all possible prefixes in the interval minus (m -k) * 1. This is based on the idea that each string after the first k contributes one unique prefix (itself), and the others are already covered.

But this is only possible if the strings are chosen such that all their prefixes except the last character are already covered by other strings.

But this is unlikely.

For example, in the first sample, m=4 and k=4. If k were 3, then the answer would be 6-1=5. But that's not the case. If we select 3 strings, like 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', the prefixes would be a, aa, ab, b, ba. So c=5. But according to this formula, it's 6-1=5. Which matches.

In this case, the formula would work.

Another example: m=3, k=2. The answer would be 6-1=5.

But how to confirm this.

But this is just a hypothesis. Need to see if this holds in general.

But how to model this.

The idea is that when you have m strings in the interval, each of them has a unique prefix of length n (the string itself). So each string contributes exactly one new prefix at level n. When you select k strings, you cover k of these level-n prefixes. The remaining (m -k) strings would each contribute 1 prefix (their own string) that is not covered. So the total c would be total_c - (m -k).

So the answer would be total_c - max(m -k, 0).

But this is only true if all other prefixes (levels 1 to n-1) are covered by the selected k strings.

But is this true?

Yes. Because any prefix of a string in the interval is covered by the selected k strings if and only if there exists at least one string in the selected k strings that shares that prefix. But since the selected k strings are part of the interval, and the entire interval's prefixes are considered in total_c, the only prefixes not covered when m >k are the level-n prefixes of the unselected strings.

But this is not correct. For example, if two strings share a prefix of length l, but only one of them is selected, the prefix is still covered.

So the only prefixes that may be missing are those of level n, which are the strings themselves. Because those are unique to each string.

So when you select k strings, you have k unique prefixes of level n. The remaining (m -k) strings' level-n prefixes are not covered. But all other prefixes (levels 1 to n-1) are covered by the selected k strings.

So the total_c is the sum of all prefixes from level 1 to n. But when you select k strings, the total c is:

sum_{l=1 to n-1} cl + k.

Because the level-n prefixes are exactly the k selected strings.

But this is only true if the sum of cl includes the level-n prefixes as part of the initial calculation.

Wait, no. The cl for level n is the number of distinct level-n prefixes in the interval. Which is exactly m, because each string is unique. So when you select k strings, the number of level-n prefixes covered is min(k, m). So when m >k, the level-n contribution is k instead of m.

So the correct formula for the answer is:

if m <=k:

    answer = total_c

else:

    answer = (total_c - m) + k

Because total_c includes the level-n contribution of m. If we select k strings, the level-n contribution is k. So the total c is total_c - m + k.

But this is only true if the sum of cl for l=1 to n-1 is (total_c - m).

Yes. Because total_c is sum_{l=1 to n} cl. For l=n, cl is m.

So if k >=m, the answer is sum_{l=1 to n} cl = total_c.

If k <m, the answer is sum_{l=1 to n-1} cl + k = (total_c - m) +k = total_c - (m -k).

This is a key insight.

Thus, the answer is:

answer = total_c - max(0, m -k)

So, putting it all together:

Compute total_c = sum_{l=1 to n} cl, where cl is computed as max(0, prefix_t[l] - prefix_s[l] + 1) if prefix_s[l] <= prefix_t[l], else 0.

Compute m = vt - vs + 1.

If k >=m, answer is total_c.

Else, answer is total_c - (m -k).

This seems to fit the examples.

Let's test the first sample:

Sample 1:

n=2, k=4.

s=aa (00 → 0), t=bb (11 → 3).

For each l:

l=1: s_val=0, t_val=3 (binary 0 and 1 for l=1?), wait no. Wait, for l=1, s_val is the first character of s, which is 'a' → 0. t_val is 'b' → 1.

So cl = 1-0+1 = 2.

l=2: s_val=0 (binary 00), t_val=3 (binary 11). cl=3-0+1=4.

total_c = 2+4=6.

m=3-0+1=4 (since vs is 0, vt is 3 → 3-0+1=4).

k=4 >=m=4 → answer is 6. Which matches the sample.

Sample 3:

n=4, k=5.

s=abbb → binary 0 1 1 1 → vs= 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 1*1 = 7.

t=baaa → binary 1 0 0 0 → vt= 8.

m=8-7+1=2. k=5 >=2 → answer is total_c.

For each l:

l=1: s_val=0, t_val=1. cl=2.

l=2: s_val=0*2 +1 =1, t_val=1*2 +0=2. cl=2-1+1=2.

l=3: s_val=0*4 +1*2 +1 =3, t_val=1*4 +0*2 +0 =4. cl=4-3+1=2.

l=4: s_val=7, t_val=8. cl=8-7+1=2.

total_c= 2+2+2+2=8.

So answer is 8. Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

n=3, k=3.

s=aba → binary 0 1 0 → vs= 0*4 +1*2 +0 =2.

t=bba → binary 1 1 0 → vt= 6.

m=6-2+1=5. k=3 <5.

answer = total_c - (5-3) = total_c -2.

Compute total_c:

l=1:

s_val=0, t_val=1. cl=2.

l=2:

s is 'ab' → 0*2 +1 =1.

t is 'bb' →1*2 +1=3.

cl=3-1+1=3.

l=3:

s_val=2 (binary 010), t_val=6 (binary 110).

cl=6-2+1=5.

total_c=2+3+5=10.

answer=10 - (5-3) = 8. Which matches the sample.

Yes, this works.

So the approach is:

1. Compute the numeric values of s and t, vs and vt.

2. Compute m = vt - vs + 1. If m <=k, the answer is the sum of cl for all l, which is computed as the sum of max(0, t_val -s_val +1) for each l where s_val <=t_val.

3. Else, the answer is sum_cl - (m -k), where sum_cl is the total_c.

Thus, the steps are:

- Precompute prefix sums for s and t.

- Compute vs and vt.

- Compute sum_cl.

- Compute m.

- The answer is sum_cl if k >=m else sum_cl - (m -k).

So now, the code can be written.

Now, the code steps:

1. Read n, k.

2. Read s and t.

3. Compute prefix_s and prefix_t for each l from 0 to n.

4. Compute vs and vt as the numeric values of s and t.

5. Compute m = vt - vs + 1.

6. Compute sum_cl:

   sum_cl = 0

   for l in 1 to n:

       s_val = prefix_s[l]

       t_val = prefix_t[l]

       if s_val > t_val:

           continue

       sum_cl += t_val - s_val +1

7. Compute answer as sum_cl - max(0, m -k) if m >k else sum_cl.

Now, the key part is efficiently computing the prefix_s and prefix_t arrays.

But n is up to 5e5, which is manageable.

But for n up to 5e5, and two loops (for s and t), each of O(n) steps, this is acceptable.

But in Python, for n=5e5, this is manageable as well.

Now, let's code this.

For example, in the first sample:

s = 'aa' → prefix_s for l=1 is 0, l=2 is 0*2 +0 =0.

t = 'bb' → prefix_t for l=1 is 1, l=2 is 1*2 +1 =3.

Thus, sum_cl is 2 (l=1) +4 (l=2) =6.

m=3-0+1=4. k=4 >=4 → answer 6.

Another example:

Third sample:

s=abbb → l=1:0, l=2:0*2+1=1, l=3:1*2+1=3, l=4:3*2 +1=7.

t=baaa → l=1:1, l=2:1*2+0=2, l=3:2*2+0=4, l=4:4*2+0=8.

sum_cl is:

l=1:1-0+1=2.

l=2:2-1+1=2.

l=3:4-3+1=2.

l=4:8-7+1=2.

sum_cl=8.

m=8-7+1=2. k=5>2 → answer 8.

So the code works.

Now, code:

Read n, k.

Read s.

Read t.

Compute prefix_s and prefix_t:

prefix_s = [0]*(n+1)

prefix_t = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_s[i+1] = prefix_s[i] * 2 + (s[i] == 'b')

    prefix_t[i+1] = prefix_t[i] * 2 + (t[i] == 'b')

vs = prefix_s[n]

vt = prefix_t[n]

m = vt - vs +1

sum_cl =0

for l in range(1, n+1):

    s_val = prefix_s[l]

    t_val = prefix_t[l]

    if s_val > t_val:

        continue

    sum_cl += t_val - s_val +1

if k >= m:

    print(sum_cl)

else:

    print(sum_cl - (m -k))

Yes.
