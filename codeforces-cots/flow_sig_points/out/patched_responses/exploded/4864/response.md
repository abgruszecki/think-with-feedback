Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about Thumbelina choosing a frog whose jump pattern results in the least number of mosquitoes being smashed. Each frog has a jump length d. The frog jumps from the island (position 0) to d, then 2d, 3d, etc., until they reach beyond the shore, which is at position n + 1. So for each frog, we need to count how many of their jumps land on hills that have a mosquito.

The input gives us m frogs with their d values, and k mosquitoes located on specific hills. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e9, but m and k are up to 100. So we need an efficient way to compute for each d, how many mosquito positions are multiples of d and are â‰¤n.

Wait, but the frog jumps on positions d, 2d, 3d, etc., until they exceed n. So the frog's path is all multiples of d that are â‰¤n. So for each mosquito's hill number x, we need to check if x is a multiple of d, and x <=n. If yes, then that mosquito is smashed by the frog with d.

So for each frog's d, the number of mosquitoes smashed is the count of x in the mosquito list where x is divisible by d and x <=n.

So the approach is:

1. For each d in the list of frogs' jump lengths:
   a. Iterate through each mosquito's x.
   b. Check if x is divisible by d and x <=n.
   c. Count how many such x exist.

Then, find all frogs with the minimum count, output how many there are and their indices in order.

But since m and k are small (up to 100 each), this approach is feasible even for large n. Because for each of the m frogs, we check k mosquitoes. So total operations are 100*100 = 10,000, which is manageable.

Wait, but what if d is very large, like 1e9, and x is 1e9. Then x/d is 1, so that's a possible case. So in code, for each x in the mosquito list, we need to check two conditions: x <=n (since the frog stops when it's beyond n, so x must be <=n) and x is divisible by d.

So for each frog d, the count is the number of x in mosquitoes where x mod d == 0 and x <=n.

But wait, the frog's path is d, 2d, 3d,... until the step exceeds n. So the maximum multiple is floor(n/d) *d. So x must be a multiple of d, and x <=n.

So the steps for the solution:

- Read n, m, k.
- Read the list of d's (m elements).
- Read the list of mosquito positions (k elements).
- For each d in the list:
   - count = 0
   - for each x in the mosquito list:
       if x <=n and x % d ==0:
           count +=1
   - store this count along with the frog's index (1-based)
- Then find the minimum count among all frogs.
- Collect all frogs that have this minimum count, sort their indices, output the count and the sorted indices.

This seems straightforward. But what about possible duplicates in the mosquito list? The problem statement says "no more than one mosquito can sleep on each hill." So each x in the mosquito list is unique, so we don't have to worry about duplicates. So each x in the list is unique.

But when reading the input, we can process the mosquito list as a set for faster lookups, but since k is small, a list would suffice.

But for each frog, we need to check each x in the mosquito list. So even with k=100, for each frog, 100 checks. So for m=100, total 10,000 operations. Which is acceptable.

So the code will be:

Read n, m, k.

Then read m integers as a list, say d_list.

Then read k integers as a list, say mosquitoes.

Then for each index i (starting from 0 to m-1), for d in d_list[i], compute the count as the sum over x in mosquitoes of (x <=n and x %d ==0).

But wait: for each x, we have to check two conditions. For example, even if x is a multiple of d, but x is larger than n, then the frog's path doesn't reach that x, so it's not counted.

So in code:

for each frog in 1..m:

   count =0

   d = d_list[i]

   for x in mosquitoes:

       if x <=n and x %d ==0:

           count +=1

   add (count, original index (i+1)) to the list of frog counts.

Once we have all counts, find the minimum count, collect all frogs with that count, sort them, output the count and the indices.

So that's the plan.

But let's test this with the sample input.

First sample:

Input:

5 3 5

2 3 4

1 2 3 4 5

So n=5, m=3 frogs, k=5 mosquitoes.

The frogs' d's are 2,3,4.

Mosquitoes are on hills 1,2,3,4,5.

For each d:

Frog 1 (d=2):

Check each x:

1: 1%2=1 !=0. So no.

2: 2<=5 and 2%2=0. Count=1.

3: 3%2=1. No.

4: yes. Count=2.

5: 5%2=1. No.

So total 2 mosquitoes.

Frog 2 (d=3):

Check x:

1: 1%3=1. No.

2%3=2. No.

3%3=0: yes. Count=1.

4%3=1. No.

5%3=2. No. So count=1.

Frog3 (d=4):

Check each x:

1%4=1. No.

2%4=2. No.

3%4=3. No.

4%4=0. x=4<=5: yes. Count=1.

5%4=1. No. So count=1.

So frogs 2 and 3 have count 1 each, which is the minimum. So output 2 frogs, indices 2 and 3.

But wait sample output shows 2 and 3 as the answer. So in the sample input, the frogs' counts are:

Frog1: 2 (x=2 and 4 are multiples of 2 and <=5).

Frog2: 3's x=3 is a multiple, and 3 is <=5. So count 1.

Frog3: 4's x=4 is a multiple, and 4<=5. So count 1.

So yes, the min is 1, achieved by frogs 2 and 3.

So the code would correctly compute that.

Another sample input:

n=1e9, m=2 frogs with d=2 and 5. Mosquitoes are 999999995, 999999998, 999999996.

We need to check for each d:

For d=2:

Check each x:

x1=999999995: is it even? 999,999,995 is odd. So no. And 999999995 <=1e9: yes, but not divisible by 2. So no.

x2=999999998: even. Yes. So count +=1.

x3=999999996: even. Yes. So count +=1. So total 2.

For d=5:

x1=999999995 mod5: 999999995 /5 is 199999999, 5*199999999=999,999,995. So mod 0. So yes.

x2=999999998 mod5: let's see 999,999,998 /5 is 199999999.6, so 5*199999999=999,999,995. 999,999,998-999,999,995=3. So mod3. Not 0. So no.

x3=999999996 mod5: 999,999,996 -999,999,995=1, so mod1. No. So for d=5, count is 1.

So the min is 1, achieved by frog2 (d=5). So the output is 1 and the index 2.

Which matches the sample.

So the code works for these cases.

Now, the problem is to implement this correctly, considering that n can be up to 1e9, but since we are checking x <=n, which is O(1) per check, there's no problem.

So the code steps:

Read the first line as n, m, k.

Read the next line as a list of m integers (d_list).

Read the next line as a list of k integers (mosquitoes list).

For each frog index (starting from 1), compute the count:

count = 0

d = current d from d_list.

for x in mosquitoes:

   if x >n: skip.

   if x %d ==0: count +=1

Store the count and the index.

Then collect all frogs' counts, find the min, collect all frogs with that min count, sort their indices, output the count and the list.

Now, code in Python:

But in Python, when you read inputs, you can process them as integers. But note that the mosquito list can have numbers up to 1e9, but in Python, that's no problem.

But for handling very large numbers, but since the processing is per x, it's okay.

So code:

Read first line: n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

Then d_list = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then mosquitoes = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then, for each i in 0..m-1:

d = d_list[i]

count = 0

for x in mosquitoes:

   if x >n:

       continue

   if x %d ==0:

       count +=1

Store the count and the index (i+1).

Then collect all the counts and indices.

Then find the minimum count.

Then collect all frogs (indices) with that count, sort them, output the count's occurrence count and the sorted list.

So code:

frogs = []

for idx in range(m):

    d = d_list[idx]

    cnt = 0

    for x in mosquitoes:

        if x > n:

            continue

        if x % d == 0:

            cnt +=1

    frogs.append( (cnt, idx+1) )  # idx+1 is the 1-based index.

min_cnt = min(frogs, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]

result = [frog[1] for frog in frogs if frog[0] == min_cnt]

result.sort()

print(len(result))

print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

Yes.

This should handle all cases.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    d_list = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    mosquitoes = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    frog_counts = []
    for idx in range(m):
        d = d_list[idx]
        count = 0
        for x in mosquitoes:
            if x <= n and x % d == 0:
                count += 1
        frog_counts.append((count, idx + 1))

    min_count = min(frog_counts, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    result = [frog[1] for frog in frog_counts if frog[0] == min_count]
    result.sort()

    print(len(result), file=output_stream)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)), file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
1000000000 2 3
2 5
999999995 999999998 999999996
""",
            "output": \
"""\

2
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Another case: d is larger than n. For example, n=5, d=10. Then the frog's first jump is 10, which is beyond n (5). So no mosquitoes are hit.

So any x in the mosquito list that is <=5 and divisible by 10 would count, but since x can't be >=1 and <=5 and divisible by 10, it's zero.

So for d=10 and n=5, the count is zero.

So code handles that.

Another test case: mosquito x=0. But the problem says the frogs start at 0 (the island), but according to the problem statement, the mosquito's x is the hill number, which starts at 1. Because the sample input's first mosquito is on hill 1. So x is >=1. So the input may not have x=0, but code will check for x <=n. So x=0 is allowed in the code? Well, according to the problem statement, the input for mosquitoes is the hill numbers, which are from 1 to n. So the code can safely process any x, even if x is 0. Because the problem says "the numbers of the hills on which each mosquito is sleeping" â€” the hills are numbered from 1 to n, so the input for the third line is k integers between 1 and n. So code can assume that x <=n, but it's better to check x <=n in code regardless.

So in the code, even if a mosquito's x is 0, which is impossible according to the problem statement, the code would check x <=n. So if n >=0, then x=0 is allowed. But according to the input constraints, n >=1, so x can't be 0. But the code is correct regardless.

So the code is correct.

Now, considering the memory constraints: m and k are up to 100, so the lists are manageable. The code uses O(m) space for frogs (each with a count and index) and O(k) for mosquitoes. So no problem with memory.

Time: For m=100, k=100: 100*100=1e4 operations. Each operation is a modulo and a comparison. Even for 1e4, in Python, it's acceptable within 2 seconds.

Yes.

So this should work.
