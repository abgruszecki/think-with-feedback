<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the goal is to find the minimal cost to expand the scopes of the antennas so that all positions from 1 to m are covered. Each expansion of an antenna's scope by 1 costs 1 coin. 

First, I need to think about the constraints. The number of antennas is up to 80, which is manageable with dynamic programming approaches, maybe. But m can be up to 1e5, which is quite big. So any approach that is O(m) or O(m*n) might be feasible, but O(n^something * m) could be problematic. 

Let me think about possible approaches. Since the problem is about covering a range with intervals (antennas' coverage), the key is to find a way to cover all positions from 1 to m with the minimal expansion cost. 

Each antenna can be expanded any number of times. The initial coverage of antenna i is [x_i - s_i, x_i + s_i]. Expanding by k_i gives coverage [x_i - (s_i + k_i), x_i + (s_i + k_i)]. The cost for each k_i is the sum of all k_i's. We need to choose k_i's such that the union of all intervals covers [1..m], and the sum is minimized.

This looks like a covering problem. The problem can be transformed into selecting a set of expanded intervals that cover [1, m], with the minimal total cost (sum of (k_i)).

But how to model this? Since n is small (up to 80), perhaps a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current position covered up to, and we track the minimal cost to reach that position. Then, for each antenna, we consider expanding it to cover some range and update the DP state accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe a greedy approach could work, but I'm not sure. For example, selecting the antenna that can cover the furthest to the right with the least cost. But the problem is that overlapping expansions might have better combined cost. So perhaps a DP approach is better.

Let's think of dynamic programming. The state could be dp[pos], which represents the minimal cost to cover up to position pos. The initial state is dp[0] = 0, since we need to cover up to 0 (which is the start, and then we need to reach m). Then, for each position, we iterate through all antennas and see how much we can extend their coverage to cover up to a certain position. 

But how to model the transitions. For each antenna i, if we decide to expand it by k_i, then the coverage becomes from a_i = x_i - (s_i + k_i) to b_i = x_i + (s_i + k_i). The cost is k_i. But considering all possible k_i for all antennas is not feasible. So perhaps we can precompute for each antenna the possible coverage ranges and the required cost, then use these to update the DP.

Wait, but even that might be tricky. Let's think: For each antenna, expanding it's scope can allow it to cover a certain range. The minimal cost to cover a certain part of the street can be determined by combining the coverage from different antennas.

Alternatively, the DP approach could track the furthest position covered so far. For example, we can model the DP as the minimal cost to cover up to a certain position. For each step, we process all possible antennas and see how much they can extend the coverage when expanded, and update the DP accordingly.

Let me outline this:

- Sort the antennas by their positions. Not sure if necessary, but maybe helps in processing.
- The DP array, dp[pos], represents the minimal cost to cover up to pos. We want to find dp[m], but since the antennas can cover beyond m, but we need up to m, perhaps we can cap it at m.

Initialize dp as infinity for all positions, except dp[0] = 0. Then, for each position from 0 up to m, for each antenna, we calculate how much we need to expand it to cover from some start point up to the current position, and then see where it can extend to.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think: For each current state in the DP (i.e., the maximum covered position is 'current_end'), we can iterate through each antenna and see how expanding that antenna can help us cover more positions. For each antenna, we can calculate the minimal expansion needed so that the antenna's coverage starts at or before 'current_end + 1' (so that there's no gap). Then, the new end would be the maximum of current_end and the antenna's new end. The cost would be the expansion required plus the current cost.

Yes! So the idea is:

For each possible current_end (tracked by the DP), and for each antenna, compute the minimal cost required to expand that antenna such that it covers from some position <= current_end + 1 (so that there's no gap) and extends as far as possible. Then, the new_end would be the maximum of current_end and the antenna's new coverage end. The cost to reach new_end is the current cost plus the expansion cost for this antenna.

This approach would allow us to model the problem as a state transition where each transition uses an antenna to expand coverage.

But how do we efficiently compute the minimal expansion cost for an antenna to cover a certain start position and extend as far as possible?

Let's break it down for an antenna i with position x_i and initial scope s_i. The initial coverage is [a_i, b_i] = [x_i - s_i, x_i + s_i]. When we expand it by k_i, the coverage becomes [x_i - (s_i + k_i), x_i + (s_i + k_i)]. The cost is k_i.

We want to use this antenna to cover from some position start (which must be <= current_end + 1) and extend as far as possible. So, for the antenna to cover up to current_end + 1 when expanded, the left end of the antenna's coverage must be <= current_end + 1, and the right end is x_i + s_i + k_i. But how much do we need to expand the antenna to ensure that the left end is <= current_end + 1, and then the right end is as far as possible.

Wait, perhaps the minimal expansion needed for antenna i to cover a certain start position. Let's say the current_end is 'end'. The next position that needs to be covered is end + 1. So to cover this, an antenna's coverage must include end+1. So, maybe the optimal way is to expand the antenna so that its left coverage reaches as far left as possible (as much as needed) but also extends as far right as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps for each antenna, given a required start point (like current_end + 1), we can compute the minimal expansion needed to cover that start point, and then see how much further right it can cover.

Wait, maybe here's the approach. For each antenna i, when considering the current_end, we can calculate the minimal k_i needed to make sure that the antenna's coverage starts at a point <= current_end + 1, which would allow it to cover the next position (end + 1). Then, expanding it beyond that would extend the coverage to the right. So for each antenna i, the required expansion is:

k_i >= (current_end + 1) - (x_i - s_i) - 1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: the left end of the antenna's coverage is x_i - (s_i + k_i). We need this left end to be <= current_end + 1. Wait, no. Because the antenna's coverage can start anywhere, but to cover the end+1, the antenna's coverage must include end+1. Wait, perhaps the antenna's coverage can start after current_end, but if it's left end is after current_end + 1, then there's a gap between current_end and the start of this antenna's coverage. So to avoid gaps, the antenna's coverage must start before or at current_end +1. Wait, maybe not. Because maybe we have another antenna that covers the gap. Hmm, but the DP approach tracks the maximum covered position. So, to cover positions up to new_end, we need the union of all antennas' coverage to cover up to new_end. So when considering an antenna, we can use it to extend the coverage as long as it covers some part that starts before or at current_end + 1, but even if there's a gap, as long as the union covers up to new_end. Wait, no. The problem is that the DP tracks the furthest covered position. So if the current_end is at position 5, and we have an antenna that covers from 7 to 10, then we can't use it to extend the coverage until the current_end is at 6 (so that the next position to cover is 7). But that antenna's coverage starts at 7, so it can't help unless another antenna covers up to 6. So in the DP approach, when considering transitions, the new coverage must start at a position <= current_end + 1. Because otherwise, there's a gap between current_end +1 and the start of the new coverage. So for the antenna to help cover the next positions, it must be expanded such that its left end is <= current_end +1. 

So, for a given current_end, to use antenna i to extend coverage, we need to expand it such that x_i - (s_i + k_i) <= current_end + 1. Also, the right end is x_i + s_i +k_i. We want to maximize the right end (to cover as far as possible), but the minimal k_i required to satisfy the left end condition.

Wait, let's compute the minimal k_i needed for the left end to be <= current_end +1. 

The left end after expansion is L = x_i - (s_i + k_i). We require L <= current_end + 1. So:

x_i - (s_i + k_i) <= current_end + 1

=> k_i >= x_i - s_i - (current_end + 1)

But k_i can't be negative. So the minimal k_i is max(0, x_i - s_i - (current_end + 1)).

Wait, solving for k_i:

k_i >= (x_i - s_i) - (current_end + 1) → rearranged:

k_i >= (x_i - s_i) - (current_end + 1) ?

Wait, let me re-arrange the inequality:

x_i - s_i - k_i <= current_end +1 → 

k_i >= (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)

But since k_i can't be negative, the minimal k_i is max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)).

Wait, that's not correct. Let's think again. The left end is L = x_i - (s_i +k_i). We need L <= current_end +1.

So:

x_i - (s_i + k_i) ≤ current_end + 1

=> (s_i + k_i) ≥ x_i - (current_end + 1)

=> k_i ≥ (x_i - (current_end + 1)) - s_i 

But since k_i can't be negative, the minimal k_i is max(0, (x_i - (current_end +1)) - s_i). 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let's re-express:

L = x_i - (s_i +k_i) ≤ current_end + 1

=> x_i - s_i -k_i ≤ current_end +1 

=> -k_i ≤ current_end +1 - x_i + s_i 

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverses inequality):

k_i ≥ x_i - s_i - (current_end +1) 

Yes. So the minimal k_i required is k_i ≥ x_i - s_i - (current_end +1). But since k_i can't be negative, so if x_i - s_i - (current_end +1) is negative, then k_i can be 0. So the minimal k_i is max(0, x_i - s_i - (current_end +1)).

Wait, but x_i - s_i is the left end of the original coverage. If this left end is already ≤ current_end +1, then no expansion is needed (k_i can be zero). Otherwise, we need to expand to bring the left end to current_end +1.

Wait, for example, if the original left end is 5, and current_end is 3. Then current_end +1 is 4. So 5 >4. So we need to expand the antenna so that its left end is ≤4. So the expansion required is 5 -4 =1. So k_i must be at least (5 - (3+1)) =1. So yes.

So for each antenna, given current_end, the minimal k_i needed to have L ≤ current_end +1 is k_i_min = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)).

Wait, no. Because x_i - s_i is the original left end. So when we expand by k_i, the new left end is x_i - s_i -k_i. So the expansion required is such that x_i -s_i -k_i ≤ current_end +1. So solving for k_i gives k_i ≥ (x_i -s_i) - (current_end +1). So the minimal k_i is max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)).

Wait, but (x_i -s_i) - (current_end +1) can be negative, which would mean that the original left end is already ≤ current_end +1. So no need to expand. So k_i_min is 0.

But if (x_i -s_i) - (current_end +1) is positive, then k_i must be at least that value. So the minimal k_i is max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)).

Then, after expanding by k_i_min, the left end is (x_i -s_i) - k_i_min = (x_i -s_i) - max(0, (x_i -s_i) - (current_end +1)) = min(x_i -s_i, current_end +1).

So the left end is adjusted to be at most current_end +1.

Then, the right end after expansion is (x_i +s_i) + k_i_min. Because the expansion is added to the original scope.

Wait, the original scope is s_i. Expanding by k_i gives s_i +k_i. So the right end is x_i + (s_i +k_i). So the right end after expansion is x_i + s_i + k_i.

So once we have the minimal k_i to get the left end to current_end +1 (or less), then the right end is x_i + s_i +k_i. But k_i is the minimal required. However, perhaps expanding more than k_i_min could allow the right end to be even further, but that would cost more. But since we're trying to minimize the total cost, we should take the minimal k_i that allows covering up to the left end. Because expanding more would cost more. But wait, maybe expanding more could cover a larger right end, which could allow us to skip some steps. For example, expanding a little more could give a much larger coverage, which might be cheaper in the long run. But how to account for that?

Ah, right. So the minimal k_i for a given antenna might not be the optimal choice. Because maybe expanding a bit more could cover a larger right end, which could help cover more positions and save cost in future steps.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the approach of taking the minimal k_i for each antenna at each step might not lead to the optimal solution.

So perhaps this suggests that we need to consider all possible k_i for each antenna, but that's not feasible given that m is up to 1e5. So how else can we model this?

Alternatively, perhaps for each antenna, the optimal expansion is such that the left end is as far left as possible (to allow coverage starting as early as possible), but the right end is as far right as possible with minimal cost. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps for each antenna, when considering the current_end, the minimal expansion to have the left end <= current_end +1 is the way to go, but then the right end is x_i + s_i + k_i_min. But perhaps expanding more could allow the right end to be larger, which would help in covering more positions, but at a higher cost. So we need to choose between these options.

But how can we model this in the DP?

Maybe the key is that for each antenna, when considering expanding it, the minimal cost to cover the current_end +1 and possibly extend as far as possible. But expanding more might be better if the cost per unit of coverage is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model all possible expansions for each antenna, but considering that the cost increases linearly with the expansion. But given that m is up to 1e5, and n is 80, this could be manageable.

Wait, here's another approach. Let's model the DP as the maximum position covered so far, and for each state, we process all possible antennas and compute the best possible expansion for that antenna to cover as far as possible. But even that might be time-consuming if there are many states.

But with n up to 80 and m up to 1e5, perhaps the DP can be optimized. Let's see:

The DP state is the current_end. For each current_end, we can process all n antennas and compute the new_end and the cost. Then, for each new_end, we keep the minimal cost.

The initial state is current_end=0, cost=0. Then, for each state, we iterate through all antennas and compute the possible transitions.

But how many states can there be? Each transition can potentially jump to a new_end up to x_i + s_i + k_i. But since k_i can be up to, say, m. However, if we process the states in order, perhaps we can use a BFS-like approach with a priority queue (Dijkstra's algorithm), since we want to find the minimal cost to reach each new_end.

Wait, that's an interesting idea. Let's model this as a graph where each node is a current_end, and edges represent the cost to expand an antenna and reach a new_end. The goal is to find the minimal cost to reach a node where current_end >= m.

But how to model the edges. For each node (current_end), and for each antenna, we can compute the minimal k_i that allows the antenna's coverage to start at <= current_end +1. Then, the new_end would be max(current_end, x_i + s_i + k_i). The cost for this edge is k_i.

But wait, what if expanding the antenna by more than the minimal k_i would result in a higher new_end, but with a higher cost. For example, if expanding by k_i_min gives new_end = a, but expanding by k_i_min + t gives new_end = a + t, with cost increased by t. Whether this is worth depends on the next steps. For example, if expanding by t gives a larger new_end, but costs t more. If that saves more than t in the next steps, it's better. But how to model this?

This seems complicated. But perhaps the optimal solution is to take the minimal k_i, because any additional expansion would cost more. But that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose expanding an antenna by 1 allows you to cover up to 100, but expanding by 2 allows you to cover up to 200. If the next antenna is at 150, expanding by 2 could save you from having to expand that next antenna. So the minimal total cost could be lower. 

So this suggests that considering only the minimal k_i may not be sufficient. But how can we handle this in the DP? Because considering all possible k_i for each antenna is not feasible.

Hmm. Another approach is to realize that for each antenna, the optimal expansion to cover a certain range is to have the left end as far left as possible (to cover as much as possible), but this depends on the existing coverage. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to use an antenna is to expand it to cover as much as possible to the right once it is used. 

Alternatively, for each antenna, when it's used to cover a certain position, the best way is to expand it such that the left end is as far left as possible (so that it covers from the earliest possible position) and the right end is as far right as possible. But this is a bit vague.

Let me think of the problem differently. Suppose that all the antennas are sorted by their position. Then, to cover the entire range [1, m], the antennas must cover overlapping intervals. The minimal cost is the sum of expansions needed to make their coverage intervals overlap and cover [1, m].

But how to arrange the intervals. Maybe it's optimal to have the antennas' coverage intervals arranged in a way that each subsequent antenna starts just after the previous one's end, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to select a subset of antennas, expand them such that their expanded intervals cover the entire [1, m], and the sum of expansions is minimal.

But with n up to 80, the subsets are 2^80, which is impossible to check. So that's not feasible.

Back to the DP idea. Let's model the state as the furthest position covered. For each state, the minimal cost to reach it. Then, for each antenna, when considering expanding it, we can compute the cost and the new furthest position.

But how to model all possible ways of expanding the antenna. For each antenna, given current_end, the minimal k_i is k_i_min = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end + 1)), and then the right end is x_i + s_i + k_i_min. Alternatively, expanding more than k_i_min would give a higher right end, but cost more. But perhaps expanding more can lead to a better new_end, which might save cost in the future.

But this could be considered as a trade-off. For example, if expanding an antenna by an additional t coins gives a right end that is t more, but costs t coins. Whether this is worth depends on how much the next steps would cost. If expanding by t allows the next step to cover a large range with minimal cost, it might be better.

But given that the problem requires the minimal total cost, it's possible that the optimal solution involves such choices. Therefore, the DP approach must consider all possible expansions of the antennas, not just the minimal k_i.

But how can we model this without considering all possible k_i for each antenna? That would be O(m * n) operations, which for m=1e5 and n=80, is 8e6 operations. Which is manageable. 

Wait, but for each antenna and each current_end, we can compute the minimal k_i that allows the antenna to cover from current_end +1. Then, the new_end would be x_i + s_i + k_i. But since k_i can be any value >= k_i_min, but higher k_i gives higher new_end and higher cost. So for each antenna and current_end, the minimal cost is to take k_i_min and new_end. Because if you take k_i_min, you get new_end as x_i + s_i +k_i_min. If you take a larger k_i, then new_end increases by (k_i - k_i_min) and cost increases by (k_i - k_i_min). So whether this is better depends on whether the increased new_end allows future steps to save more than (k_i -k_i_min) coins.

But in the DP approach, since we track the minimal cost for each new_end, perhaps taking k_i_min is sufficient, because any larger expansion would cost more for the same or less new_end. Wait, no. For example, if you expand by k_i_min and get new_end a, then expanding by k_i_min + t would give new_end a + t, but cost increases by t. So for the same new_end a + t, the minimal cost would be the cost to reach current_end plus k_i_min + t. But if someone else can reach a + t with a lower cost, then that's better.

So, in other words, for a given antenna, when expanding by k_i_min, you get a certain new_end. If you expand by more, you get a higher new_end, but each unit of expansion costs 1. So the cost to reach new_end a + t would be (cost to reach current_end) + (k_i_min + t). But if there's another way to reach a + t with a lower cost, that's better.

But considering that the minimal cost for a new_end is the minimal cost over all possible transitions, perhaps considering only the minimal k_i (k_i_min) is sufficient. Because any expansion beyond k_i_min would require paying more for the same new_end. Wait, no. For example, expanding by k_i_min gives new_end a. Expanding by k_i_min +1 gives new_end a +1, but costs 1 more. But if you need to cover up to a +1, maybe there's another way to reach a +1 with lower cost. So, the DP approach would naturally choose the minimal cost for each new_end.

Thus, perhaps the optimal way is to for each state (current_end), and for each antenna, compute the minimal k_i required to expand the antenna such that it can cover from current_end +1, then the new_end is x_i + s_i +k_i. Then, for each possible new_end, we keep track of the minimal cost to reach it.

In this way, the transitions would be O(n) per current_end. And the number of current_end is up to m. So the total time is O(n*m), which for n=80 and m=1e5 is 8e6 operations, which should be manageable.

But how to implement this efficiently. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize a DP array where dp[pos] is the minimal cost to reach pos. Initially, dp[0] = 0, and others are infinity.

2. For each current_end from 0 to m-1, if dp[current_end] is not infinity, then for each antenna, compute the minimal k_i required to cover from current_end +1. Then compute the new_end as x_i + s_i + k_i. If the new_end is >= current_end, then update dp[new_end] to be the minimum between its current value and dp[current_end] + k_i.

But wait, this approach would process the current_end in order. But the new_end could be larger than current_end, so we need to process states in a way that allows us to process them in order. Alternatively, we can use a priority queue to always pick the state with the current_end that has the minimal cost. But that's more like Dijkstra's algorithm, which could be more efficient.

Wait, but the cost is additive. So the first time we reach a certain new_end with a cost, it's the minimal possible. So using a priority queue (like Dijkstra's) is better because once we process a new_end, we can ignore any future higher-cost entries for the same new_end.

So here's the plan:

- Use a priority queue (min-heap) that keeps track of the current_end and the cost to reach it. The priority is the cost.

- Initialize the heap with (0, 0), which is cost 0 to reach position 0.

- Use a dictionary or array to track the minimal cost for each position. Initially, all are infinity except position 0 which is 0.

- While the heap is not empty:

   - Pop the current_end with the minimal cost.

   - If current_end >= m, return the cost.

   - For each antenna in the list:

      - Compute k_i_min = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)) 

      - new_end = x_i + s_i + k_i_min

      - new_end = max(new_end, current_end)  # in case the antenna's coverage is entirely before current_end.

      - if new_end >= m: new_end = m

      - cost = current_cost + k_i_min

      - if cost < dp[new_end]:

         - update dp[new_end] to cost

         - add (cost, new_end) to the priority queue.

But wait, this approach will process each possible new_end once, but only the first time it's popped from the heap (since that's when the minimal cost is found). However, since new_end can be up to m (1e5), the heap could have a lot of entries. But with n=80 and m=1e5, and each step possibly adding 80 entries, the total number of operations could be up to 8e6, which is manageable.

But wait, in the worst case, each step can generate multiple entries for the same new_end, but with higher costs. However, Dijkstra's algorithm would process the minimal cost first and then ignore higher costs for the same new_end. So using a priority queue here is the right approach.

But what about the new_end being beyond m? For example, if the antenna's coverage extends beyond m. But since we only need to cover up to m, perhaps we can cap the new_end at m. Because once we cover up to m, we don't care about anything beyond. So in the code, when computing new_end, we can set new_end = min(new_end, m). Wait, no. Because if the antenna's coverage is up to new_end which is larger than m, then the new_end would be m, since we only need to cover up to m. So whenever the new_end exceeds m, we can cap it at m. But in that case, the coverage is sufficient. So once new_end is m, we can stop.

So during the processing, whenever a new_end >= m is found, the code can immediately return the cost, because that's the minimal cost to reach m. Alternatively, once the heap's popped a state where current_end >= m, return that cost.

But how to handle that. For example, if new_end is m, then that's a candidate. But if another antenna can reach m with a lower cost, the code should process that first.

So in the code:

Each time we pop a state (current_end, current_cost) from the heap:

   if current_end >= m: return current_cost.

So the first time we reach a new_end >= m, that's the minimal cost.

But how to ensure that the first time is the minimal. Because the priority queue is a min-heap sorted by cost. So the first time we reach a new_end >= m, that's with the minimal cost.

Yes. Because the first entry in the priority queue for any new_end is the one with the minimal cost. So the first time we process a new_end >= m, that is the minimal cost. So the code can return immediately.

This seems like a viable approach.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

3 595

43 2 → initial coverage [41, 45]

300 4 → initial coverage [296, 304]

554 10 → initial coverage [544, 564]

The optimal solution is expanding the first antenna by 40 (k=40) → coverage [1, 85], the second by 210 → coverage [86, 514], third by 31 → coverage [513, 595]. Total cost 281.

Let's see how the algorithm would process this.

The initial state is current_end=0, cost=0.

For each antenna:

Antenna 1 (43,2):

k_i_min = max(0, (43 - 2) - (0+1) ) → (41 -1) =40 → k_i_min=40.

new_end =43 +2 +40 =85.

Add (40, 85) to the heap.

Antenna 2 (300,4):

k_i_min = (300-4) -1 =296-1=295. → current_end is 0, so (300-4)=296. 296-1=295. So k_i_min=295. So new_end =300 +4 +295= 599. But since m=595, new_end is 595. Cost is 0 +295=295.

Add (295, 595) to the heap.

Antenna3 (554,10):

k_i_min =554-10 -1=543 →543. So new_end=554+10+543=1107 → cap to 595. Cost 543. So added to the heap.

But the minimal cost first entry is (40,85). Then, process current_end=85, cost=40.

For each antenna:

Antenna1:

k_i_min = (43-2) - (85+1) →41-86 =-45 →k_i=0. new_end=43+2+0=45. 45 <85 → new_end remains 85. So no change.

Antenna2:

k_i_min =300-4 - (85+1) →296-86=210 →k_i=210. new_end=300+4+210=514. Cost=40+210=250.

Add (250,514) to the heap.

Antenna3:

k_i_min=554-10 -86=554-10 is 544 →544-86=458 →k_i=458. new_end=554+10+458=1022 →595. Cost=40+458=498.

Add (498,595).

Now the heap has (250,514), (295,595), (498,595). The next is 250, 514.

Process current_end=514, cost=250.

Check if 514 >=595? No. So proceed.

For each antenna:

Antenna1: k_i_min=41- (514+1)=41-515= -474 →0. new_end=45. So new_end remains 514. No update.

Antenna2: k_i_min=296 -515= -219 →0. new_end=304. So new_end is 514. No change.

Antenna3: k_i_min=554-10 -515=544-515=29 →k=29. new_end=554+10+29=593. So cost=250+29=279. new_end=593. Since 593 <595, add (279,593) to the heap.

Now, the heap has (279,593), (295,595), (498,595). Next is 279,593.

Process current_end=593, cost=279. Check if 593 >=595? No. Proceed.

For each antenna:

Antenna1: k_i_min=41 -594 →-553 →0. new_end=45. No change.

Antenna2: k_i_min=296 -594= -298 →0. new_end=304. No change.

Antenna3: k_i_min=544 -594= -50 →0. So new_end=554+10+0=564. Which is 564, but current_end is 593. So new_end remains 593. No change. So we need to expand antenna3.

Wait, current_end is 593. So current_end +1 is 594.

For antenna3, x_i=554, s_i=10. So the left end after expansion must be ≤594.

Original left end is 554-10=544. So when expanded by k_i, it's 554 - (10 +k_i) ≤594. 

Wait, 554 - (10 +k_i) ≤594 →554-10 -k_i ≤594 →544 -k_i ≤594 →-k_i ≤50 →k_i ≥-50. Since k_i can't be negative, k_i_min is 0. So the left end is 544, which is <=594. So no expansion needed. So new_end is 554+10+0=564. But current_end is 593. So new_end is max(593, 564) =593. So no change. So adding a transition that new_end remains 593, but cost is 279+0=279. Which is same as current cost. So no update.

Thus, this doesn't help. So the next step is to process the (295,595) entry. But wait, when we process the current_end=514, we added (250,514) and then when processing that, we added (279,593). 

But then, when processing 593, the only possible expansion is antenna3 with k_i_min= (554-10) - (593+1) =544-594= -50 →k_i_min=0. So new_end=554+10+0=564. So new_end is 564, but current_end is 593. So new_end is max(593,564) →593. So cost remains 279.

But then, how do we reach 595?

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let's see.

When current_end is 593, the next position to cover is 594. So for any antenna, we need to expand it such that its coverage includes 594 and 595.

So for antenna3, after expanding, the coverage is [554 - (10 +k_i), 554 + (10 +k_i)].

We need to cover 594 and 595. So the left end must be <=593+1=594, and the right end must be >=595.

So:

554 + (10 +k_i) >=595 →564 +k_i >=595 →k_i >=31.

But also, the left end must be <=594. So:

554 - (10 +k_i) <=594 →544 -k_i <=594 →k_i >=544 -594 →k_i >=-50. Since k_i >=0, so this is automatically satisfied.

So to cover up to 595, antenna3 needs to be expanded by at least 31. Then, the right end is 564+31=595.

The cost for this expansion is 31. So new_end becomes 595.

The current_end is 593. So the new_end is max(593, 595) →595. The cost is 279 +31=310. But wait, but in the sample input, the cost is 281. So where is the mistake?

Ah, here's the problem. Because the algorithm as described would not consider expanding antenna3 beyond the minimal required to cover the current_end+1. But in the sample input, the third antenna's expansion is 31. But according to the algorithm, when current_end is 85 (from the first antenna), the third antenna's k_i_min is 458. But in the sample solution, the third antenna is only expanded by 31. So how is this possible?

This suggests that the algorithm is not considering all possibilities. For example, the third antenna's expansion to cover the later parts may require a different k_i that is not computed when processing earlier current_end steps.

So perhaps the algorithm is missing some transitions. Like, when current_end is 85, processing the third antenna requires expanding by 458, but in reality, a different path could have been taken where the third antenna is expanded less.

This indicates that the algorithm's approach is incorrect. It's not considering that some antennas may be expanded in a later step with a smaller cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the algorithm's approach assumes that the antenna must be expanded to cover current_end+1, but in reality, the antenna may be used to cover a later part of the range, not necessarily immediately after the current_end.

For example, in the sample input, after the second antenna is expanded to cover up to 514, the third antenna is expanded to cover from 513 to 595, which requires an expansion of 31. But according to the algorithm, when processing current_end=514, the third antenna's k_i_min is (554-10) - (514+1) =544-515=29. So expanding by 29 gives coverage up to 554+10+29=593. Then, expanding by 2 more would get to 595. But that would require two steps: first to 593, then another expansion. But according to the algorithm, when current_end is 514, the new_end is 593, cost 279. Then, when processing current_end=593, the algorithm would check for all antennas again.

At current_end=593, the required next position is 594. For the third antenna, expanding by 31 would allow it to cover 595. But how to compute this.

Wait, the current_end is 593. So for the third antenna:

k_i_min is max(0, (554-10) - (593+1)) →544-594= -50 →0. So expansion is 0. The right end is 564. So new_end is 593 (max(593,564)).

But to cover 594 and 595, we need to expand the third antenna by 31. So in the current_end=593 state, we need to expand it by 31. But according to the algorithm, the k_i_min is 0, but we need to expand by 31. So how?

Ah, here's the problem. The algorithm only considers the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1. But in this case, the current_end is 593. The next positions are 594 and 595. Expanding the third antenna by 31 would allow it to cover up to 595. But in the current_end=593 state, the antenna's coverage after expansion by 31 is [554 - (10+31) = 513, 595]. So the left end is 513, which is <=593+1=594. So the expansion is allowed. But the k_i required is 31.

So in this case, the algorithm's approach of taking k_i_min as max(0, (x_i -s_i) - (current_end+1)) would compute:

x_i -s_i is 554-10=544. current_end+1 is 594. So (x_i -s_i) - (current_end+1) is 544-594= -50. So k_i_min is 0. So expanding by 31 would cost 31. But the algorithm only considers expanding by k_i_min, which is 0. So the new_end would be 564, which is 564 <595. But then, how to get to 595?

Ah, this is the crux of the problem. The algorithm's approach only considers expanding the antenna to cover current_end +1. But in reality, the antenna can be expanded to cover positions beyond current_end +1, but in that case, the left end might not need to be as far left as current_end+1. For example, the third antenna's left end is 513 (after expanding by 31), which is <=593+1. So the expansion is allowed. But the algorithm would not compute this expansion when processing current_end=593. Because it calculates the minimal k_i required to have the left end <=594. But expanding by 31 is allowed, and the new_end is 595.

But how to find this expansion.

The problem is that the algorithm's current approach only computes the minimal k_i required to have the left end <= current_end+1. However, expanding the antenna further (with higher k_i) can also be allowed as long as the left end is <= current_end+1. But the algorithm's approach is to take the minimal k_i (0) and compute the new_end as 564. But this misses the case where expanding by 31 would allow the new_end to be 595.

So, the algorithm's approach is missing this possibility. Because when expanding by 31, the left end is 554 - (10+31) =513, which is <=594. So it's allowed. So the expansion is possible. But according to the algorithm's current approach, the minimal k_i is 0, so new_end is 564. But expanding by 31 would require k_i=31, which is allowed. So the algorithm needs to consider expanding by k_i >=0, and select the one that gives the best new_end for the cost.

But how to model this.

Ah! So for each antenna and current_end, the possible k_i is any value >=k_i_min. For each such k_i, the new_end is x_i + s_i +k_i. The cost is current_cost +k_i. So for each antenna and current_end, there are infinitely many possible k_i, but each possible k_i gives a new_end and cost. But this is not feasible to model directly.

But perhaps there's a way to find the optimal k_i for each antenna and current_end.

The optimal k_i would be the one that maximizes new_end minus cost. Because for each unit of cost, you get (x_i + s_i +k_i) - new_end_prev. So the ratio is (x_i +s_i +k_i) - new_end_prev) /k_i.

But since cost increases by 1 for each unit of new_end, perhaps the optimal is to expand as much as possible. Because each additional expansion of k_i increases new_end by 1 and increases cost by 1. So the ratio is 1. So in terms of cost per new_end, it's the same as any other expansion. So, there's no advantage in expanding more than the minimal required. Because for each additional expansion, you pay 1 to get 1 more new_end.

But wait, in the sample input, expanding the third antenna by 31 gives new_end 595. The cost is 31. But according to the algorithm's approach, when processing current_end=593, expanding by 31 (k_i=31) would give new_end=595, cost=279+31=310. But the sample's solution has a total cost of 281. So how does that fit?

Wait, the sample's solution uses the third antenna's expansion to cover from 513 to 595, which is an expansion of 31. How did they reach that in the algorithm.

Let's think of the steps:

The first step is expanding the first antenna by 40 to reach 85. Cost 40.

The second step is expanding the second antenna by 210 to reach 514. Cost 40+210=250.

The third step is expanding the third antenna by 31 to reach 595. Cost 250+31=281.

But according to the algorithm's approach, when processing current_end=514, the third antenna's k_i_min is 29. Because:

k_i_min = (554-10) - (514+1) =544-515=29. So expanding by 29 gives new_end=554+10+29=593. Cost 250+29=279. Then, from current_end=593, expanding the third antenna by 31 (k_i=31) would require k_i_min=0 (since 544 -594= -50), but that's allowed. So expanding by 31 would cost 31. new_end=554+10+31=595. So total cost 279+31=310. Which is higher than the sample's 281.

So the algorithm's approach would find a higher cost than the sample's solution.

This indicates that the algorithm's approach is incorrect, and there's a flaw in the logic.

The problem is that the algorithm's approach requires the antenna's left end to be <= current_end+1, but in the sample solution, the third antenna's left end is 554 - (10 +31) = 513, which is <= current_end (514) +1 =515. So when processing current_end=514, the third antenna can be expanded by 31, which requires k_i=31. But according to the algorithm's current logic, the minimal k_i is 29, leading to new_end=593, but expanding by 31 is also allowed, but not considered.

So the algorithm's approach is missing this possibility. Because for current_end=514, the minimal k_i is 29, but expanding by 31 is allowed, leading to new_end=595. But why would that not be considered?

Because when processing current_end=514, the algorithm computes k_i_min=29 and new_end=593. The cost is 250+29=279. But expanding by 31 (k_i=31) would cost 250+31=281 and new_end=595. This is a valid transition. But according to the algorithm's approach, this transition is not considered.

So the problem is that the algorithm only considers the minimal k_i for each antenna, which gives the minimal cost for that antenna's expansion. But there are other possible expansions (with higher k_i) that could lead to a better total cost.

So the algorithm's approach is incomplete. It needs to consider all possible k_i for each antenna, which is impossible. So what's the solution?

Hmm. Perhaps there's another way to model the problem. Let's think of each antenna's contribution as a possible interval expansion. The expansion cost is k_i, and the new coverage is [x_i - (s_i +k_i), x_i + (s_i +k_i)]. We need to select a set of these intervals to cover [1, m], with minimal sum of k_i.

But how to model this. The problem is similar to interval covering with the minimal cost. But the intervals are not fixed; each antenna can generate infinitely many intervals based on k_i.

But perhaps the key is to find for each antenna the best possible way to expand it to cover certain parts of the range. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to select for each position the best possible antenna to cover it, but this seems unclear.

Another idea is to model the problem using dynamic programming, but for each current_end, we track the minimal cost and allow transitions by expanding any antenna to cover from any possible position to a new_end. But this requires a way to compute the minimal cost for each possible new_end.

But given that the antennas can be expanded to cover varying ranges, perhaps we can precompute for each antenna the possible ways it can contribute to covering the range.

Alternatively, think of each antenna as providing a certain cost to reach a certain new_end. For example, for a given antenna i, the cost to reach a new_end of e is (e - (x_i + s_i)) + max(0, (x_i - s_i - (current_end +1))). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, for each antenna i, and for any possible current_end, the minimal cost to expand it to cover a certain new_end e. For example, given current_end, the minimal k_i to expand antenna i so that it covers current_end+1 and up to e. The k_i would be max( (e - (x_i + s_i)), max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1)) ) ). Wait, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, think of for an antenna i, the expansion k_i can be written as:

k_i = a + b, where a is the expansion required to cover the left side (to current_end+1), and b is additional expansion to cover more to the right.

The cost is a +b. The new_end is x_i + s_i + a +b.

But a is max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end+1)), and b is >=0.

So, for a given current_end, the minimal a is determined. Then, any b >=0 can be added. The new_end is x_i + s_i + a +b = (x_i + s_i +a) +b. The cost is a +b. 

But adding b gives new_end = (x_i + s_i +a) +b. The cost increases by b. So for each unit of b, new_end increases by 1, and cost increases by 1. So, in terms of cost per new_end, it's 1:1. So, whether to add b depends on whether any future steps can save cost by having a higher new_end. But since each unit of new_end costs 1, there's no benefit in expanding more than the minimal required a. Because any future steps would have to pay 1 per unit to cover the same new_end. So, it's better to expand by the minimal a and let future steps decide whether to expand other antennas.

Thus, the algorithm's initial approach is correct. But then why does the sample input not get handled correctly?

Ah, in the sample input, the third antenna's expansion is 31, but according to the algorithm's approach, the minimal a for current_end=514 is 29. So expanding by 29 gives new_end=593. Then, from current_end=593, the algorithm would process other antennas. 

But in the sample input, the third antenna is expanded by 31 to cover up to 595. So how to reach that.

At current_end=514, the third antenna's a is 29, new_end=593. So cost is 250+29=279. Then, processing current_end=593, the algorithm would look for antennas to cover 594 and 595. 

At current_end=593, the next position is 594. For the third antenna:

a = max(0, (554-10) - (593+1)) = max(0,544-594) =0. So expanding by 0 gives new_end=554+10+0=564. Which is less than 593. So new_end remains 593. But to cover up to 595, the third antenna needs to expand by 31. 

But how can that be done. The algorithm's approach would not consider expanding the third antenna beyond the minimal required a (0) in this case. 

So the algorithm's approach is missing the case where the third antenna's expansion is more than a. But in this case, the expansion of 31 would require k_i=31. But since a is 0 (for current_end=593), the new_end would be 554+10+31=595. The cost is 279+31=310. But according to the sample solution, the cost is 281. So the algorithm's approach is not finding the optimal path.

So, this indicates that the initial approach is incorrect. Because the algorithm's approach would miss certain paths where expanding an antenna by more than the minimal a leads to a lower total cost.

This suggests that the DP approach needs to consider not just the minimal a, but also any possible expansion of the antenna beyond a. But how?

But considering all possible expansions is not feasible. So perhaps there's another way to model this.

Alternative approach:

Instead of considering the current_end, model the problem as the minimal cost to cover the interval [1, current_end]. Then, for each antenna, when expanding it, compute the new coverage [L, R], and the new_end is max(current_end, R). The cost is the sum of the expansions.

But the problem is to find the minimal cost such that the new_end >=m.

But this is again similar to the DP approach.

Another idea: For each antenna, the optimal expansion is to have its coverage start as far left as possible and end as far right as possible. So perhaps for each antenna, we can precompute all possible possible coverage ranges where the left end is <= some position, and the right end is as far as possible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the key insight is that the optimal solution consists of expanding some antennas in such a way that their coverage intervals overlap. So, the problem is to select a subset of expanded intervals that cover [1, m], and their sum of expansions is minimal.

But with n up to 80, this is not feasible to check all subsets.

Another idea: The minimal cost is achieved by expanding each antenna exactly once. Because expanding the same antenna multiple times would not be optimal. For example, expanding an antenna once to cover a certain range, then expanding it again later to cover a larger range. But this would cost more than expanding it once to cover the larger range in the first place. So, it's optimal to expand each antenna once, if used.

So the problem reduces to selecting for each antenna a single expansion amount k_i, and the sum of all k_i is minimized, such that their coverage intervals cover [1, m].

But how to model this.

This is a classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard. However, since m is up to 1e5 and n is 80, we need a more efficient approach.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach can be modified to consider expanding antennas in a way that allows for larger k_i.

The problem with the initial approach is that for each transition, it only considers the minimal a (k_i_min) for the current_end. But perhaps, for each antenna and current_end, we should compute the minimal k_i such that the antenna's coverage covers current_end +1 and as far right as possible, and then also consider expanding the antenna to cover further.

But how to model that.

Alternatively, for each antenna and current_end, compute the minimal k_i required to cover current_end +1, and then compute the new_end. Then, the new_end can be up to x_i + s_i +k_i, which depends on k_i. But k_i can be increased beyond the minimal. 

But since the cost increases by 1 per unit k_i, and the new_end increases by 1 per unit k_i, it's better to take the maximal new_end possible with minimal cost. 

Wait, no. Because each unit of expansion costs 1. So, the cost per unit new_end is 1. So if we expand an antenna by t units, paying t coins, and the new_end increases by t units. So, for any t, the cost and the new_end increase by the same amount. So there's no benefit in expanding more than the minimal required. Because if you expand by t units, you're paying t coins to cover t new positions, but those positions could be covered by other antennas with lower cost. So, it's better to expand by the minimal required and then let other antennas cover the remaining positions.

So, the initial approach should work. But why does it fail in the sample case?

Because in the sample case, after expanding the second antenna to 514, the third antenna's minimal expansion is 29, leading to new_end=593. Then, from 593, expanding the third antenna by 31 is allowed, but this would require paying 31 coins to cover up to 595. But in the sample solution, the third antenna is expanded by 31 from the start, which would require a cost of 31, but the initial approach's path requires 29 +31=60 coins for the third antenna. So why is the sample's solution better?

Because in the sample solution, the third antenna is expanded in a single step (cost 31), whereas the algorithm's path requires two steps (29 and 31), totaling 60.

So the initial approach's path is more expensive than the sample's solution. But why is the algorithm's approach not finding the better path?

Because in the algorithm's approach, when processing current_end=85 (cost 40), the third antenna's k_i_min is 458, which would give new_end=554+10+458=1022 → capped at 595. So cost is 40+458=498. Which is higher than the sample's total cost of 281. So that path is not taken.

Then, after processing the second antenna's expansion (current_end=514, cost 250), the third antenna's k_i_min is 29, leading to new_end=593 (cost 279). Then, expanding the third antenna again by 31 (cost 310). But this totals 310, which is higher than the sample's 281.

So why is the sample's solution cheaper? Because the third antenna is expanded once by 31, and the other expansions are 40 and 210, totaling 281.

Ah, I see. The algorithm's approach is not considering that the third antenna can be expanded by 31 when the current_end is 85. Because in that step, the third antenna's k_i_min is 458 (for current_end=85), which is way higher than 31. But how can the third antenna's expansion by 31 be allowed when current_end is 85.

When current_end is 85, current_end+1 is 86. The third antenna's expansion by 31 gives a left end of 554 - (10+31) =513. Which is <=86. No, 513 is way larger than 86. So the left end is 513, which is greater than 86. So that's not allowed. So expanding the third antenna by 31 would not cover 86, which is required.

Ah, this is the key. The sample's solution uses the third antenna to cover from 513 to 595. But when the current_end is 514, expanding the third antenna by 31 (k_i=31) allows it to cover from 513 to 595. Because 513 is <=514+1=515. So this is allowed. So the expansion is allowed when current_end is 514. 

In this case, the k_i_min is 29, but expanding by 31 is allowed as well. Because expanding by 31 will result in the left end being 513, which is <=515 (current_end+1=514+1=515). So the expansion by 31 is allowed, but the algorithm's approach would not consider this.

Because the algorithm's approach calculates k_i_min as 29, but expanding by 31 (k_i=31) is allowed, and gives new_end=595. The cost is 250+31=281. Which is the sample's solution.

But why does the algorithm's approach not consider this possibility?

Because the algorithm's approach only considers the minimal k_i for each antenna and current_end. But in this case, expanding by 31 is allowed, and gives a higher new_end but a higher cost. But in this case, the higher cost (31) leads to a new_end of 595, which is the desired m. So the algorithm's approach would find this path if it's considered.

But how to modify the algorithm to consider this possibility.

Ah, I see. The algorithm's current approach is to compute the minimal k_i to cover current_end+1. But expanding by more than that k_i_min is allowed, but the algorithm doesn't consider it. So the algorithm's approach is incorrect because it misses the case where expanding an antenna by more than the minimal k_i could cover a larger new_end, thus reaching m in a single step and having a lower total cost.

So, how to adjust the algorithm to account for this.

The solution is to compute for each antenna and current_end the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1, but also compute the minimal k_i required to cover up to m, which could be higher. But how.

Alternatively, for each antenna and current_end, compute the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1 and the minimal k_i required to cover up to m. But this would not be feasible.

Alternatively, for each antenna and current_end, when expanding, compute the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1, and also compute the required k_i to cover up to m. But how.

Alternatively, for each transition from current_end, consider the antenna's expansion to cover up to m. For example, the required k_i for antenna i to cover m is k_i >= (m - (x_i + s_i)). Because the right end must be >=m. So the minimal k_i to cover m is max( (m - (x_i + s_i)), a_i ), where a_i is the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1.

So, in the sample case, when current_end is 514, the third antenna's a_i is 29. The required k_i to cover m is max(29, (595 - (554+10))=595-564=31). So the k_i must be 31. So expanding by 31 gives new_end=595. The cost is 250+31=281, which is the sample's solution.

Thus, the algorithm's approach needs to consider not just the minimal k_i to cover current_end+1, but also the required expansion to reach m. But how to model this.

Ah! For each antenna and current_end, the minimal k_i required to cover current_end+1 and also reach m. Because expanding to cover m might require a larger k_i.

So, for each transition, the minimal k_i is the maximum between:

- The required k_i to cover current_end+1 (a_i).

- The required k_i to cover m (b_i = max(0, m - (x_i + s_i))).

But in this case, if the antenna can cover m by expanding by b_i, then the new_end would be m, and the cost is a_i + b_i. Wait, no. Because a_i is the expansion required to cover current_end+1, and b_i is the expansion required to cover m. So the total k_i is max(a_i, b_i). 

But no. The expansion k_i must be such that the antenna's left end is <= current_end+1 and the right end >=m. So the required k_i is:

k_i >= max( a_i, b_i )

Where a_i = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1) )

b_i = max(0, m - (x_i + s_i) )

So, if you expand the antenna by k_i = max(a_i, b_i), then the left end is <= current_end+1, and the right end is >=m. So new_end would be min(x_i + s_i +k_i, m). 

Thus, in this case, the new_end is m. So for each antenna and current_end, if the antenna's right end after expanding by max(a_i, b_i) is >=m, then we can transition to new_end = m with cost current_cost + max(a_i, b_i).

So, the algorithm's approach should also consider this possibility.

Thus, the adjusted algorithm would:

For each current_end and each antenna, compute two transitions:

1. Expand by a_i (k_i_min) to reach new_end = x_i + s_i + a_i.

2. Expand by max(a_i, b_i) to reach new_end = m.

Then, the minimal cost between these transitions would be considered.

But why would this help? Because in the sample case, when current_end is 514 and antenna 3 is considered, a_i is 29, b_i is 31. So expanding by 31 (max(29,31)) gives new_end =m (595). The cost is 250+31=281, which is the sample's solution.

Thus, the algorithm should consider both transitions.

But how to implement this.

So, the algorithm would process each antenna in two ways for each current_end:

a) Expand to cover current_end+1, with new_end = x_i + s_i + a_i.

b) Expand to cover m, with new_end = m and k_i = max(a_i, b_i).

This way, the algorithm considers the possibility of expanding the antenna not only to cover current_end+1, but also to cover m in a single step.

Thus, the algorithm's steps would be:

For each current_end and antenna:

1. Compute a_i = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1) )

   new_end_a = x_i + s_i + a_i

   if new_end_a >=m → new_end_a =m

   cost_a = current_cost + a_i

   if cost_a < dp[new_end_a], then update.

2. Compute b_i = max(0, m - (x_i + s_i) )

   k_i = max(a_i, b_i)

   new_end_b = min(x_i + s_i +k_i, m)

   cost_b = current_cost +k_i

   if new_end_b >=m → new_end_b =m

   if cost_b < dp[new_end_b], then update.

This way, for each antenna and current_end, we consider both expanding to cover the next position and expanding to cover m.

But this doubles the number of transitions (from n to 2n per current_end). But with n=80 and m=1e5, this would be 160 transitions per current_end, leading to 1.6e7 operations, which should be manageable.

Let's test this adjusted approach against the sample input.

Sample input 1:

current_end=514, cost=250.

Antenna3:

a_i = max(0, 544 -515)=29.

new_end_a =564 +29=593. cost_a=250+29=279.

b_i = max(0,595-564)=31.

k_i = max(29,31)=31.

new_end_b =564+31=595 → m. cost_b=250+31=281.

So when processing current_end=514, the code would add two transitions: (279,593) and (281,595).

The latter transition (281,595) would be added to the heap. 

When the heap is processed, the entry (281, 595) would be popped. Since 595 >=m, return cost 281.

This matches the sample's solution.

Thus, the adjusted approach would correctly handle this case.

So the key adjustment is to consider both transitions: expanding to cover current_end+1, and expanding to cover m.

So the algorithm's code needs to be adjusted to compute both transitions for each antenna.

Thus, the code should for each antenna and current_end compute two possible expansions: one for covering the next position, and another for covering m in a single step.

This way, all possible options are considered, including expanding the antenna to cover m in a single step even if that requires a larger k_i.

Thus, the code should be modified as follows:

In the processing loop for each current_end:

for each antenna:

   compute a_i = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end +1) )

   new_end_a = x_i + s_i + a_i

   new_end_a = min(new_end_a, m)

   new_end_a = max(new_end_a, current_end)  # in case the antenna's coverage is before current_end.

   cost_a = current_cost + a_i

   if cost_a < dp[new_end_a]:

      update dp[new_end_a] and add to the heap.

   compute b_i = max(0, m - (x_i + s_i) )

   k_i = max(a_i, b_i)

   new_end_b = x_i + s_i +k_i

   new_end_b = min(new_end_b, m)

   new_end_b = max(new_end_b, current_end)

   cost_b = current_cost +k_i

   if cost_b < dp[new_end_b]:

      update dp[new_end_b] and add to the heap.

Thus, each antenna contributes two transitions to the heap.

This would ensure that the algorithm considers expanding antennas to cover m in a single step, which is crucial for cases like the sample input.

This adjusted approach should handle all cases correctly.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

The steps are:

- Read n and m.

- Read the n antennas, store their x_i and s_i.

- Initialize the DP array (a dictionary or list) with infinity for all positions, except 0 which is 0.

- Use a priority queue (heapq) to process states in order of increasing cost.

- For each state (current_end, current_cost) popped from the heap:

   - If current_end >=m, return current_cost.

   - For each antenna:

      - Compute a_i = max(0, (x_i - s_i) - (current_end + 1))

      - Compute new_end_a = min(x_i + s_i +a_i, m)

      - new_end_a = max(new_end_a, current_end)  # because expanding can't reduce coverage.

      - cost_a = current_cost +a_i

      - If cost_a < dp[new_end_a], update and add to heap.

      - Compute b_i = max(0, m - (x_i + s_i))

      - k_i = max(a_i, b_i)

      - new_end_b = min(x_i + s_i +k_i, m)

      - new_end_b = max(new_end_b, current_end)

      - cost_b = current_cost +k_i

      - If cost_b < dp[new_end_b], update and add to heap.

But for large m (1e5), using a list for the DP array is feasible. So in Python, we can use a list of size m+1.

But m can be up to 1e5. So in Python, a list of 1e5+1 elements is manageable.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.

Now, let's implement this.

But wait, there's a problem. The new_end_a and new_end_b can be up to m, which is 1e5. So the DP array needs to have at least m+1 elements.

But in Python, creating a list of size 1e5+1 is acceptable.

So, the code:

import heapq

n, m = map(int, input().split())
antennas = []
for _ in range(n):
    x, s = map(int, input().split())
    antennas.append( (x, s) )

INF = float('inf')
dp = [INF] * (m + 2)  # m can be 1e5, indexes up to m+1
dp[0] = 0
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, (0, 0))

while heap:
    cost, current_end = heapq.heappop(heap)
    if current_end >= m:
        print(cost)
        exit()
    if cost > dp[current_end]:
        continue
    for x, s in antennas:
        # Compute a_i and new_end_a
        a_i = max(0, (x - s) - (current_end + 1))
        new_end_a = x + s + a_i
        new_end_a = min(new_end_a, m)
        new_end_a = max(new_end_a, current_end)
        cost_a = cost + a_i
        if new_end_a <= m and cost_a < dp[new_end_a]:
            if cost_a < dp[new_end_a]:
                dp[new_end_a] = cost_a
                heapq.heappush(heap, (cost_a, new_end_a))
        # Compute b_i and new_end_b
        b_i = max(0, m - (x + s))
        k_i = max(a_i, b_i)
        new_end_b = x + s + k_i
        new_end_b = min(new_end_b, m)
        new_end_b = max(new_end_b, current_end)
        cost_b = cost + k_i
        if new_end_b <= m and cost_b < dp[new_end_b]:
            if cost_b < dp[new_end_b]:
                dp[new_end_b] = cost_b
                heapq.heappush(heap, (cost_b, new_end_b))

print(dp[m])

But wait, the code has some redundancy. For example, new_end_a and new_end_b may be the same if expanding to m. Also, there might be overlapping transitions. However, using the priority queue ensures that the first time a new_end is processed, it's with the minimal cost.

Testing this code against the sample input:

Sample input 1:

3 595
43 2
300 4
554 10

When current_end=514, processing the third antenna (554,10):

a_i = max(0, 554-10 -515) →544-515=29. 

new_end_a =554 +10 +29=593. cost_a=250+29=279.

b_i = max(0, 595-564)=31.

k_i = max(29,31)=31.

new_end_b =554+10+31=595 → cost_b=250+31=281.

Thus, the code adds (279,593) and (281,595) to the heap. When the (281,595) is popped, since 595 >=m, it returns 281, which is correct.

Another sample input:

Sample input 2:

1 1

1 1

The initial coverage is [0, 2], which covers 1. So cost is 0. The code should return 0.

Sample input 3:

2 50

20 0

3 1

The initial coverage:

Antenna1: 20-0=20 to 20+0=20.

Antenna2: 3-1=2 to 3+1=4.

After expanding:

Antenna1 needs to cover from 5 to 50. But it's at 20, with s=0. So the required expansion is 20 - (5) =15 (k_i_min=15). new_end_a is 20+0+15=35. cost_a=15. Then, from 35, expand again to cover up to 50. But the optimal solution is to expand antenna2 to cover up to 50.

But according to the code, when current_end=0:

Antenna2: x=3, s=1.

a_i = max(0, (3-1) - 0+1) →2-1=1. So a_i=1. new_end_a=3+1+1=5. cost_a=1.

b_i = max(0, 50 -4)=46. k_i= max(1,46)=46. new_end_b=3+1+46=50. cost_b=46. So the code adds (1,5) and (46,50) to the heap.

The (1,5) is processed first. 

When current_end=5, processing antenna1 (20,0):

a_i = max(0, 20-0 -6)=14. new_end_a=20+14=34. cost_a=1+14=15.

b_i =50-20=30. k_i= max(14,30)=30. new_end_b=20+30=50. cost_b=1+30=31.

So new_end_b=50, cost 31.

Meanwhile, the (46,50) entry is still in the heap. But when current_end=5 is processed, the code adds these transitions. However, when the (46,50) is popped, the cost is 46, which is higher than 31. But the code would first process the (31,50) transition when current_end=34.

But this requires further steps. But the sample's expected output is 30. So the code may not be handling this correctly.

Wait, the sample input 3's expected output is 30.

The code's approach may not find this. Let's see.

Sample input3:

Antenna1: x=20, s=0 → initial coverage [20, 20].

Antenna2: x=3, s=1 → initial coverage [2,4].

The optimal solution is to expand Antenna2 by 46 to cover up to 50. Because expanding by 46 gives coverage [3-47, 3+47] → [-44, 50]. But the required coverage is up to 50. But since the problem allows covering positions outside [1, m], this is allowed. The cost is 46. But according to the sample input's expected output, the answer is 30. 

Wait, the sample input3's expected output is 30. So what's the correct way to get this.

Wait the sample input3:

Input:

2 50

20 0

3 1

The output is 30.

The optimal solution is to expand antenna2 (3,1) by 46. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps the optimal solution is to expand antenna1 (20,0) by 30. Then, its coverage is [20 -30, 20+30] → [-10,50], which covers 1-50. The cost is 30. Which matches the sample's expected output.

Ah, right! So the code must find this path.

So the code needs to consider expanding antenna1 by 30, which allows it to cover up to 50.

Let's see what the code does.

When current_end=0, processing antenna1 (20,0):

a_i = max(0, (20-0) - (0+1)) →20-1=19. So a_i=19. new_end_a =20+0+19=39. cost_a=19.

b_i =50 -20=30. So k_i= max(19,30)=30. new_end_b=20+30=50. cost_b=30.

So the code adds (19, 39) and (30, 50) to the heap.

The (30,50) entry would be processed after other lower-cost entries. But when current_end=0, processing antenna1 gives cost_b=30, new_end=50. So this is added to the heap.

So when the code processes the heap, the first entry is (0,0), then (1,5) (from antenna2), (19,39), (30,50), etc.

The (30,50) entry is in the heap. When it's popped, the code checks if 50 >=m (50 is equal to m). So it returns 30, which is the correct answer.

Thus, the code would correctly handle this case.

Thus, the code seems to handle all the sample cases correctly.

Now, the code uses a priority queue and tracks the minimal cost to each new_end. By considering both transitions (a_i and b_i), it covers both the minimal expansion to cover the next position and the expansion to reach m.

This should handle all cases correctly.
