Okay, so the problem is to find the minimum number of characters to replace in the AI name (let's call it S) such that the phone's name (P) does not appear as a substring. The goal is to determine the minimal replacements needed.

Hmm. Let's think about the approach. We need to make sure that every occurrence of P in S is somehow "broken" by replacing at least one character in each occurrence. But if there are overlapping occurrences, we might be able to cover multiple with a single replacement. For example, if P is "aa" and S is "aaaaa", then the occurrences are at positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. If we replace position 2, that breaks all overlapping occurrences. So the optimal here is 1 replacement.

So the key is to find all the positions where P occurs in S, and then find the minimal number of positions to replace such that each occurrence of P has at least one replaced character.

But how do we model this? It's like an interval covering problem. Each occurrence of P is an interval of length len(P), and we need to place the minimal number of points (replacements) such that each interval has at least one point. Then, the minimal points would give us the answer.

Yes, exactly. So the steps would be:

1. Find all the starting indices in S where P occurs as a substring.
2. For each of these intervals (start, start + len(P) - 1), we need to cover them with points (replacements) such that each interval has at least one point. The minimal number of points is the answer.

But how to find all the occurrences of P in S efficiently? The constraints are len(S) up to 1e5 and len(P) up to 30. So a naive approach for each possible substring would be O(n*m), which could be up to 3e6, which is manageable. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, using the KMP algorithm for pattern matching would be more efficient. KMP can find all occurrences in O(n + m) time. That's better for large n. But since m is up to 30, even a naive approach would be O(n * m) which is 1e5 * 30 = 3e6 operations. That's acceptable.

Wait, but for each position in S, check if the substring starting at i matches P. For each i from 0 to len(S) - len(P), check if S[i:i+len(P)] == P. That's O(m) per i, leading to O((n - m +1)*m). But if m is 30, and n is 1e5, then (n - m) is about 1e5, multiplied by 30 is 3e6 operations. That's acceptable for Python, right? Because even 1e8 operations might be tight, but 3e6 is manageable.

So perhaps the first step is to collect all the starting indices where P occurs. Once we have all the intervals, then we can model the problem as the interval covering problem where we need to select points (positions to replace) such that each interval has at least one point. The minimal points is the answer.

The interval covering problem here is similar to the classic activity selection greedy problem where we select the earliest possible end points to maximize coverage with minimal points. Wait, but in this case, the optimal strategy is to select the earliest end of each interval as the point, which allows covering as many overlapping intervals as possible.

So the approach would be:

Sort the intervals by their end. Then, for each interval, if it's not covered by the last selected point, select its end as a point and add it to the count.

Wait, the interval is [start, end], where end is start + len(P) -1. For each occurrence, the interval is of length len(P). We need to cover each such interval with at least one point. The optimal way is to select the earliest possible end of the intervals, sorted by their end, and greedily pick points.

For example, arrange the intervals in order of their end. Then, for the first interval, select the end. Then any overlapping intervals that include this point are covered. Then proceed to the next interval not covered, select its end, etc.

This is the standard greedy algorithm for interval covering, which gives the minimal number of points.

So steps:

1. Find all occurrences of P in S. For each occurrence, create an interval [start, start + len_p -1], where len_p is the length of P.

2. Sort these intervals based on their end values in ascending order.

3. Initialize a variable last_selected_point = -infinity. Count = 0.

4. Iterate through the sorted intervals. For each interval, if the start > last_selected_point, then we need to select a point. Select the end of this interval as the point, increment count, and set last_selected_point to this end.

This way, each selected point covers all overlapping intervals that include it.

This will give the minimal number of points required.

So for the first example:

AI name: "intellect", P is "tell" (length 4).

Occurrences start at index 2. The interval is [2,5]. The optimal point is 5. So replacing position 5 (the 'l') would break this occurrence. So the answer is 1.

Another example, in the third sample input:

S is "sirisiri", P is "sir" (length 3). Occurrences are at 0, 4. So intervals [0,2] and [4,6]. These are non-overlapping, so each requires a point. But wait, no, the first interval is 0-2, the second is 4-6. So two points needed. But the sample output is 2. So that's correct.

Another possible occurrence if S is "sirsir". Then occurrences are at 0 and 3. The intervals are [0,2] and [3,5]. They don't overlap, so two points.

Wait, but if there's overlapping occurrences, like if P is "aaa" and S is "aaaaa", then the occurrences are at 0,1,2. The intervals are [0,2], [1,3], [2,4]. These are overlapping. The optimal here is to choose point 2, which covers all three intervals. So count is 1.

So the approach of selecting the end of each interval when it's not covered by previous points is correct.

So the plan is:

- Find all intervals where P occurs.

- Apply the greedy interval covering to find the minimal points.

Now, the problem reduces to:

a) Efficiently find all occurrences of P in S.

b) Apply the interval covering algorithm.

Now, for part a), given that len(P) can be up to 30, and len(S) up to 1e5, the O(n*m) approach may be feasible, but KMP is better.

Let's think about implementing the KMP algorithm to find all occurrences.

But in Python, for len(S) up to 1e5 and len(P) up to 30, perhaps a sliding window approach would be manageable.

But let's see.

For example, for each possible starting position i in S, check if the substring S[i:i+len_p] equals P.

In Python, comparing substrings of length up to 30 is O(m) time, but for m=30 and n=1e5, it's 1e5 *30 = 3e6 operations, which is acceptable.

So perhaps for simplicity, it's better to implement the sliding window approach.

So code steps:

Read S and P.

len_s = len(S), len_p = len(P).

If len_p > len_s, then output 0.

Else:

Check all i from 0 to len_s - len_p:

   if S[i:i+len_p] == P:

       add interval [i, i + len_p -1] to the list.

Once all intervals are collected, proceed with the interval covering.

But comparing each substring with P could be time-consuming. Wait, but for each i, the check is O(m) time. So for len_p=30 and len_s=1e5, 3e6 operations. In Python, each character comparison is O(1), so the total time would be acceptable.

Alternatively, precompute a rolling hash for S and compute the hash for P, then compare the hashes. But that might be overkill here. For m up to 30, the straightforward approach is manageable.

So let's proceed with the sliding window approach.

Once all intervals are collected, sort them by their end.

Then, apply the greedy algorithm.

So the code steps in Python:

s = input().strip()

p = input().strip()

len_s = len(s)

len_p = len(p)

if len_p > len_s:

    print(0)

    exit()

intervals = []

target = p

for i in range(len_s - len_p + 1):

    if s[i:i+len_p] == target:

        intervals.append( (i, i + len_p -1) )

Now, after collecting intervals, sort them by end.

Then, the greedy approach.

count = 0

last = -1

for interval in intervals:

    start, end = interval

    if start > last:

        # need to place a point here

        count +=1

        last = end

return count

So the answer is count.

But wait, how to handle overlapping intervals? For example, if intervals are [0,2], [1,3], sorted by end as [2,3], then the first interval is [0,2]. Select end 2. Then the next interval starts at 1 <= 2, so no need to select. So count is 1.

Yes, correct.

Another example: in the third sample input, the intervals are [0,2], [4,6]. So after sorting by end, first interval is [0,2], select end 2. Next interval starts at 4 >2, so select end 6. Count is 2.

Which matches the sample.

So the code works.

Now, let's test the code with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

intellect

tell

Processing:

len_p is 4. len_s is 8. So check i from 0 to 4.

Check substring from 2: s[2:6] is 'tell', which matches. So interval is [2,5].

So intervals list is [ (2,5) ].

Sort by end (already sorted).

Count starts at 0, last is -1.

First interval start 2 > -1: count becomes 1, last is 5.

No more intervals. Output is 1. Correct.

Sample 3:

Input:

sirisiri

sir

s is 'sirisiri' (len 8). p is 'sir' (len 3). So check i from 0 to 5.

i=0: 'sir' matches. interval [0,2].

i=1: s[1:4] is 'iri' no.

i=2: s[2:5] is 'ris' no.

i=3: s[3:6] is 'isi' no.

i=4: s[4:7] is 'sir' yes. interval [4,6].

i=5: s[5:8] is 'iri' no.

So intervals are [(0,2), (4,6)].

Sort by end: same order.

Processing:

First interval start 0 > -1: count becomes 1, last=2.

Next interval start 4 >2: count becomes 2, last=6.

So output is 2. Correct.

Another test case where overlapping occurs.

For example, S is 'aaaaa', P is 'aa'. len_p is 2. So intervals are [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]. Sorted by end.

The code would process:

First interval (0,1). Select end 1. Then next intervals start at 1 (which is <=1) are skipped. Then interval (2,3): start >1. Select end 3. Then interval (3,4) is covered by 3? No. Wait, the next intervals would be [1,2], but when sorted by end, the intervals would be in order (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4). Wait no, sorted by end:

The original intervals are (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4). Their ends are 1,2,3,4. So sorted as is.

Processing:

0,1: start 0 > -1 → count=1, last=1.

Next interval (1,2): start 1 is ≤1 → no.

Next interval (2,3): start 2>1 → count=2, last=3.

Next interval (3,4): start3>3 → count=3, last=4.

Total count is 3. But the optimal is 2. Wait, what's wrong here?

Wait, in this example, the optimal solution is to replace positions 1 and 3. Then, all occurrences are covered. Because:

Occurrences are at 0-1 (covers 0 and 1), 1-2 (covers 1 and 2), 2-3, 3-4.

If we replace position 1 and 3:

Each occurrence is covered. So the minimal count is 2. But according to the code, the answer would be 3.

Wait, that's a problem. So the code's approach is not optimal here. Oh no! So this suggests that the interval covering approach is incorrect for overlapping intervals.

Wait, what's the issue here?

Let me see. The code's approach is to select the end of the earliest-ending interval first. So in the example:

The intervals sorted by end are [0-1], [1-2], [2-3], [3-4].

The code selects 1 (end of first interval). Then, the next interval that starts after 1 is [2-3], selects 3. Then [3-4] starts after 3, selects 4. So count is 3.

But the optimal is 2: replace positions 1 and 3. How?

Because the intervals [0-1] is covered by 1, [1-2] is covered by 1, [2-3] is covered by 3, [3-4] is covered by 3. So replacing 1 and 3 gives 2, which is better.

So the code's approach is not optimal in this case. So the problem is that the intervals are overlapping in such a way that a different selection can cover more intervals with fewer points.

So what's wrong with the approach? It seems like the standard interval partitioning approach is not applicable here. Wait, no. Wait, the standard interval covering problem is to find the minimal number of points that "hit" every interval. The greedy algorithm (select the earliest possible end) is optimal. So why is this not working here?

Wait, let's re-examine the example:

Intervals (sorted by end):

[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]

The code picks 1 (covers first two intervals), then 3 (covers third and fourth), but how? Because the third interval is [2,3], which starts at 2. After selecting 1, the next interval to process is [1,2], which starts at 1. Since 1 <=1, it's covered. Then the next is [2,3], which starts at 2>1: select 3. Then [3,4] starts at3>3 → no, so select 4. So total 3 points. But the optimal is 2.

Wait, but how can that be? Let's see:

If I select 1 and 3. Then:

[0-1] is covered by 1.

[1-2] is covered by 1.

[2-3] is covered by 3.

[3-4] is covered by 3.

Yes, that's correct. So the minimal points are 2. But the code's approach gives 3. So why?

Ah, because the code's approach picks the first interval's end, then skips all overlapping intervals. But in this case, the next interval after [0-1] is [1-2], which starts at 1. Since 1 is <=1 (the last selected point), it's covered. So after selecting 1, the code will process the next interval [1-2], but since start is 1 <=1, it's covered, so no action. Then the next interval is [2-3], start is 2>1. So select end 3. Now, [2-3] and [3-4] start at 3 which is >3 (after selecting 3, next interval is [3-4], start=3>3 is false (3 is not >3), so no. Wait, no, the code checks if start > last. So after selecting 3, last is 3. The next interval is [3-4], start is3, which is not >3, so it's not covered. So the code would select 3 as a point, but [3-4] is not covered. So the code would then process [3-4], see that start 3 is <=3 (last is 3), so no action. So count remains 2?

Wait, no. Let's walk through the code step by step.

The intervals sorted by end are:

(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4).

Processing starts with count=0, last=-1.

First interval (0,1):

start=0 > last (-1) → yes. So count +=1 (now 1). last is set to 1.

Next interval (1,2):

start=1 > last (1) → no. So skip.

Next interval (2,3):

start=2>1 → yes. count +=1 (now 2). last is set to 3.

Next interval (3,4):

start=3 >3 → no. So skip.

So the code returns count=2. Wait, that's correct. But earlier analysis thought that the code would process [3,4] as start=3 > last=3 is false. So no.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Let me re-calculate.

After first interval (0,1) is processed, last=1.

Next interval (1,2). start=1. 1 <= last (1). So no action.

Next interval (2,3). start=2>1 → yes. count becomes 2. last=3.

Next interval (3,4). start=3 <= last (3). So no action.

So code returns 2, which is correct.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So in that case, the code's approach would give the correct answer.

But then, why did I get the initial thought that the code would select 3 points? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the example.

So perhaps the code is correct. Let me check again.

Another example:

S = 'aaaaa', P='aa' → len_p=2. The intervals are:

0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.

Sorted by end: same as above.

Processing:

First interval (0,1). start=0 >-1 → count 1, last=1.

Next interval (1,2). start=1 <=1 → no.

Next interval (2,3). start=2>1 → count 2, last=3.

Next interval (3,4). start=3 <=3 → no.

Total count is 2. Which is optimal. So the code is correct.

So why did I think earlier that the code would return 3? Because I must have made a mistake in the code walk-through. So the code is correct.

So the code's approach works.

Another test case:

S= 'abcde', P= 'abcde' → len_p=5. So one interval [0,4]. The code would select 4, count=1.

Which is correct.

So the code works.

Thus, the approach is:

Find all intervals where P occurs as a substring.

Sort these intervals by their end.

Apply the greedy algorithm to select the minimal points that hit each interval.

The answer is the number of points selected.

Now, the key part is efficiently finding all the occurrences of P in S.

In Python, checking each possible i from 0 to len_s - len_p is O((n - m +1)*m) time. For n=1e5 and m=30, it's 1e5 *30 = 3e6 operations. Which is acceptable.

But for larger m, like m=1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is not acceptable. However, in the problem statement, the len(P) is up to 30. So it's manageable.

So implementing the sliding window approach is feasible.

Now, let's code this.

Edge cases:

- When P is longer than S: output 0.

- When P is not found: output 0.

- When multiple overlapping intervals.

Another example:

Sample 3:

Input:

sirisiri

sir

The code correctly finds two intervals and returns 2.

Another edge case: S is P. So interval is [0, len_p-1]. So count is 1.

Another edge case: S has multiple non-overlapping occurrences. For example, S is 'abcabcabc', P is 'abc' → intervals are [0,2], [3,5], [6,8]. Sorted by end. Each interval is non-overlapping with the previous. So code returns 3.

But if we can select positions 2,5,8. But the code would select 2 (for first interval), then next interval starts at 3>2, so select 5, then next interval starts at6>5, select 8. Total 3. Correct.

Thus, the code is correct.

So now, implement the code.

Potential optimizations:

In the sliding window approach, comparing substrings can be optimized by pre-checking the first character. For example, if the first character of the window doesn't match P's first character, skip. Otherwise, check the rest.

But in Python, the substring comparison is optimized in C, so perhaps it's faster to just do the s[i:i+m] == p check directly.

Now, code:

Read S and P.

Compute len_p and len_s.

If len_p > len_s: print 0.

Else:

Collect all intervals where s starts with p.

Then, sort intervals by end.

Apply the greedy algorithm.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    p = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    n = len(s)

    m = len(p)

    if m > n:

        print(0, file=output_stream)

        return

    intervals = []

    target = p

    p_len = m

    for i in range(n - m + 1):

        if s[i:i+m] == target:

            intervals.append( (i, i + m -1) )

    if not intervals:

        print(0, file=output_stream)

        return

    # Sort intervals by end

    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    count = 0

    last_end = -1

    for start, end in intervals:

        if start > last_end:

            count +=1

            last_end = end

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [

    print('Tests passed 😎')

```

Sample 2:

s = 'google' p='apple' → no matches. Output 0.

Sample3:

s = 'sirisiri' p='sir' → two intervals. count 2.

Another test case:

s='aaaaa', p='aa' → intervals are [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]. Sorted by end.

The code will select 1 and 3, count=2. Correct.

Another test case: s='aabaaab', p='aaa' → occurrences? Let's see. len_p=3.

Possible substrings:

i=0: 'aab' no.

i=1: 'aba' no.

i=2: 'baa' no.

i=3: 'aaa' (assuming the string is 'a a a a ...') → no. Wait, example s='aaaaa' for p='aa' gives 4 intervals.

But in any case, the code seems to handle it.

Thus, the code is correct.

```python
