Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says we need to compute the product of f(x, i) for i from 1 to n, modulo 1e9+7. And each f(x, i) is the product of g(i, p) for each prime p in the prime factors of x. 

First, I need to understand what g(i, p) is. Oh right, g(y, p) is the highest power of p that divides y. Like, for example, if y is 45 and p is 3, then 3^2 divides 45 but 3^3 doesn't. So g is 9.

So for each prime p in the prime factors of x, we need to calculate the product of the highest power of p dividing each number from 1 to n. Then multiply all those results for each prime together, modulo 1e9+7.

Wait, but how do primes in x's prime factors affect this? Because x could have multiple primes. Like, if x is 30 (primes 2, 3, 5), then for each number y from 1 to n, we compute the product of the highest power of 2 in y, the highest power of 3 in y, and the highest power of 5 in y. Then multiply all those for y from 1 to n.

So the overall approach is:

1. Factorize x into its prime factors. For example, x=140 gives primes 2,5,7. So the primes are unique here. So for x, we can find all unique primes in its factorization.

2. For each such prime p, compute the product of the highest exponent of p dividing each number from 1 to n. Then multiply all these products for each p together, modulo 1e9+7.

So the key steps are:

- Factorizing x into its prime factors. Since x can be up to 1e9, factorization is manageable.

- For each prime p in the factors, compute the product of p^k for each y in 1..n, where k is the maximum exponent such that p^k divides y. Wait, no. Wait, for each y in 1..n, and for a given p, the contribution to the product is the highest power of p that divides y. Then for all y from 1 to n, multiply all these contributions for p, and then do this for all p in primes of x.

Wait, but for each y, the product over p in primes of x of g(y, p) is f(x, y). So the total product is the product for each p of (product for y from 1 to n of g(y, p)), since multiplication is commutative and associative. Because when you multiply all f(x,y) for y=1 to n, each term is product of g(y,p) for p in primes. So the overall product is the product over p of (product over y of g(y,p)). 

Ah, that's a crucial insight. Because the product of products can be reordered into the product for each prime p of the product of g(y,p) for all y in 1..n. So for each prime p, we compute the product of the highest power of p dividing each y in 1..n, and then multiply all these per-prime products together.

So the problem reduces to, for each prime p in the prime factors of x, compute the product of the highest power of p that divides each number from 1 to n. Then multiply all these per-p products, modulo 1e9+7.

So the steps are:

1. Factorize x into primes. Let's call the primes S = {p1, p2, ..., pk}.

2. For each p in S:

   a. Compute the product of g(y, p) for all y from 1 to n.

3. Multiply all these products for each p in S, modulo 1e9+7.

So the main challenge is, for each p, compute the product of the highest power of p dividing each number in 1..n. Let's think about how to compute that.

For a given p, the product would be p^sum, where sum is the sum of the exponents of p in each y in 1..n. Wait, no. Wait, for each y in 1..n, the maximum power of p that divides y is p^k, where k is the exponent of p in y's prime factors. For example, y=12 and p=2: 12 has 2^2, so the contribution is 4. The product of all these p^k terms is p^(sum of exponents for each y). So the product for p is p^(sum_{y=1}^n (k where p^k is the maximum in y)).

Wait, but how to compute this sum?

Wait, the sum of the exponents of p in the prime factorization of each number from 1 to n. Because for each y, the maximum exponent of p dividing y is exactly the exponent of p in y's prime factors. Because if y is divisible by p^k but not p^{k+1}, then the exponent is k. So the sum over all y from 1 to n of the exponents of p in y is equal to the sum of the exponents in each of their prime factors. 

Wait, but how does that relate to Legendre's formula? Legendre's formula gives the exponent of p in n! as sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n/p^i). Because each multiple of p contributes at least 1, each multiple of p^2 contributes an additional 1, etc. But here, for each y in 1..n, the exponent of p in y is the sum of floor(y/p^i) for i=1 to infinity, but that's not the case. Wait, no. Wait, the exponent of p in y is the maximum k such that p^k divides y. So for each y, it's the sum of 1 for each i where p^i divides y. Wait no, that's not. The exponent of p in y is the maximum k where p^k divides y. For example, y=12 and p=2: exponent is 2, because 2^2 divides 12, but 2^3 doesn't.

Wait, Legendre's formula gives the sum of the exponents of p in the prime factors of each number from 1 to n, when multiplied together (i.e., in n! ), as the sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n/p^i). But in this problem, for each y in 1..n, the exponent of p in y is the maximum k such that p^k divides y. So the sum for all y of exponents of p in y is exactly equal to the sum of floor(n/(p^1)) + floor(n/(p^2)) + ... because each multiple of p contributes once for each power. Wait no, wait. Let's think. For example, numbers divisible by p but not p^2: they contribute 1. Numbers divisible by p^2 but not p^3: contribute 2. And so on. So the total sum is the sum for each i ≥1 of the number of multiples of p^i in 1..n. Because for each i, each multiple of p^i contributes 1 to the exponent. For example, for a number like p^3, it's divisible by p, p^2, p^3. So each of these contributes 1, so the exponent is 3. So the sum over all exponents of p in y is the sum for each i≥1 of the count of numbers in 1..n divisible by p^i. Which is exactly the same as Legendre's formula. So sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n/p^i). 

But wait, in the problem, for each y, the contribution to the product is p^{k}, where k is the exponent of p in y. So the product for p is the product of p^{k} for each y. Which is equal to p^{sum_{y=1}^n k}, where k is the exponent of p in y. So the product is p^total_sum, where total_sum is sum_{y=1}^n (exponent of p in y). 

Thus, for each prime p, we need to compute total_sum = sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n / p^i), and then compute p^total_sum mod MOD. 

Wait, but wait. That sum is exactly the exponent of p in n! So the sum is the same as the exponent of p in n! 

So for each prime p in the factorization of x, the product of the g(y, p) for y from 1 to n is equal to p^{e}, where e is the exponent of p in n! 

So the problem reduces to, for each prime p in the prime factors of x, compute p^{e} mod MOD, where e is the exponent of p in n! Then multiply all those terms together mod MOD.

Wait, that's a huge simplification! Because then, for each prime p in x's factorization, compute the exponent of p in n! (using Legendre's formula) and then multiply p^exponent mod MOD, then multiply all those mod MOD together.

So the steps are:

1. Factorize x into primes, say primes = [p1, p2, ..., pk].

2. For each pi in primes:

   a. Compute e_i = sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / (pi^m)) 

   b. Compute (pi^e_i) mod MOD.

3. Multiply all the (pi^e_i) mod MOD terms together, mod MOD.

This is the correct approach. So the main steps are factorization, computing exponents, and computing exponents modulo MOD-1 (due to Fermat's little theorem? Wait, MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime. So when computing p^e mod MOD, we can compute e mod (MOD-1) since p and MOD are coprime (if p is not MOD itself). But since x can be up to 1e9, and MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime larger than 1e9, the primes in x's factorization can't be MOD. So all primes p in the factorization are coprime with MOD, so by Fermat's theorem, p^(k) mod MOD can be computed as p^(k mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD. Because MOD is prime, so phi(MOD) = MOD-1. So for exponents, we can take them modulo (MOD-1), but only if p is not a multiple of MOD, which they can't be here.

So, for each prime p in x's factorization:

- Compute exponent e_i = sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n/(p^m)). 

- Compute exponent e_i modulo (MOD-1), since p and MOD are coprime. Then compute p^(e_i mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD.

Wait, but if e_i is very large, like up to 1e18, then exponentiating p to e_i would be time-consuming. But using the pow function with mod and exponent mod (MOD-1) would allow us to compute this efficiently. For example, pow(p, e_i, MOD) can be done quickly using Python's built-in pow with three arguments, which is optimized. 

So the steps are:

For each prime p in primes:

- Compute e_i as the sum of floor(n / p^m) for m from 1 until p^m >n.

- Compute pow(p, e_i, MOD).

Multiply all these results modulo MOD.

So the key parts are:

1. Factorizing x into its prime factors. For x up to 1e9, trial division is feasible. Since 1e9's square root is 3e4, which is manageable. Or we can use some optimized trial division.

2. For each prime p in the factors, compute e_i. For example, for p=2 and n=1e18, we need to compute sum_{m=1} while 2^m <=n. For each m, compute floor(n/(2^m)). The sum is O(log n) steps per prime.

But n can be up to 1e18, so for each m, p^m can be up to n. So for p=2, m can go up to log2(n), which is 60 steps. For p=1e9 (if x is a prime like 1e9+7), then p^2 is 1e18+... which is larger than n=1e18. So for p=1e9, m can be 1, since p^1 is 1e9, and p^2 is 1e18, which is equal to n=1e18, then m=2. So the number of steps per prime is O(log_p n), which is manageable.

So for each prime p, the loop to compute e_i is O(log n), which is acceptable.

Now, the code steps:

First, factorize x. Let's write a function to get the unique primes of x. For example, x=140 gives 2,5,7. So, we need the set of primes in x's factorization.

Then, for each prime p in that set, compute e_i. Then compute (p^e_i) mod MOD, multiply all of them together mod MOD.

Now, handling the exponents: e_i can be up to sum_{m=1}^infty n/(p^m) ≤ n/(p-1). For p=2, this is up to n. But for n=1e18, e_i can be up to 1e18, which is a huge exponent. Computing pow(p, e_i) mod MOD directly would be impossible unless we use the built-in pow with three arguments, which is efficient. But since p and MOD are coprime, we can compute e_i modulo (MOD-1) (using Fermat's little theorem) because p^(k mod (MOD-1)) ≡ p^k mod MOD when MOD is prime. So, for each e_i, we compute e_mod = e_i % (MOD-1), then compute pow(p, e_mod, MOD). Wait, but is this correct?

Wait, Fermat's little theorem states that if p is not divisible by MOD, then p^(MOD-1) ≡ 1 mod MOD. So, p^k ≡ p^(k mod (MOD-1)) * (p^(MOD-1))^(k/(MOD-1)) ) mod MOD. But since the (p^(MOD-1)) term is 1 mod MOD, this simplifies to p^(k mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD. So yes, we can compute e_mod = e_i mod (MOD-1), and then compute pow(p, e_mod, MOD). Wait, but this is only true if p and MOD are coprime. Since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime larger than x (since x is up to 1e9), all primes in x's factorization are less than MOD, hence coprime with MOD. So yes, we can use this approach.

Wait, but if MOD is 1e9+7, which is prime. So for each p in the primes of x, p < MOD. So p and MOD are coprime (since MOD is prime and p < MOD, so p can't be a multiple of MOD). Therefore, Fermat's applies, and exponents can be reduced modulo MOD-1.

So the steps for each prime p:

Compute e_i as the sum of floor(n / p^m) for all m >=1 where p^m <=n.

Then, compute exponent e_mod = e_i % (MOD-1). Then the contribution for p is pow(p, e_mod, MOD).

Wait, but what if e_i is very large, like 1e18? The pow function in Python can handle exponents as big as that when using three arguments, but if we first compute e_mod = e_i % (MOD-1), which is up to MOD-1, then we can compute pow(p, e_mod, MOD) efficiently.

So, the code steps:

Read x and n.

MOD = 10**9 +7

Compute primes = unique primes in x's factorization.

If x is 1, primes would be empty, but according to the input constraints, x >=2. So no problem.

For each p in primes:

   compute e = sum of floor(n / p^m) for m from 1 to ... while p^m <=n.

   e_mod = e % (MOD-1)

   contribution = pow(p, e_mod, MOD)

Multiply all contributions modulo MOD.

So, the code structure is:

Read x, n.

Factor x into primes (unique).

Compute the product as the product of (p^sum_floor) mod MOD for each p.

Now, the factorization function. Let's implement trial division. For x up to 1e9, trial division is acceptable. So:

def factorize(x):

    primes = set()

    i =2

    while i*i <=x:

        if x%i ==0:

            primes.add(i)

            while x%i ==0:

                x =x//i

        i +=1

    if x>1:

        primes.add(x)

    return primes

Yes. This function will return the unique primes in the factorization of x.

Then, for each p in primes, compute the sum of floor(n/p^m).

But how to compute that sum. Let's see.

Initialize sum_e =0

current = p

while current <=n:

    sum_e += n//current

    current *=p

So for example, p=2, n=10:

current=2: 10//2=5. sum_e=5.

current=4: 10//4=2. sum_e=7.

current=8: 10//8=1. sum_e=8.

current=16: exceeds n, loop ends. sum_e=8.

Which is correct, since 10! has 8 factors of 2.

Yes.

So in code:

for p in primes:

    e =0

    current = p

    while current <=n:

        e += n//current

        current *=p

        if current >n:

            break

    e_mod = e % (MOD-1)

    product = product * pow(p, e_mod, MOD) % MOD

Wait, but what if e is 0? For example, p is a prime divisor of x, but p >n. Then, current = p >n, so the loop doesn't run, e=0. Then pow(p, 0, MOD) is 1. So the contribution is 1, which is correct because for all y in 1..n, p does not divide any y, so g(y,p) is 1. So the product for p is 1.

So yes.

But in code, for exponents, even if e is 0, pow(p, 0) is 1.

So the code steps:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9+7

    x, n = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    primes = set()

    # factorize x into primes

    temp = x

    i =2

    while i*i <= temp:

        if temp%i ==0:

            primes.add(i)

            while temp%i ==0:

                temp = temp//i

        i +=1

    if temp>1:

        primes.add(temp)

    result =1

    mod = MOD

    phi_mod = mod -1 # since mod is prime

    for p in primes:

        e =0

        current = p

        while current <=n:

            e += n // current

            next_current = current * p

            # prevent overflow? For p=2, current could be 1e18, next_current would be 2e18, but n is 1e18, but in Python, it's okay.

            # but wait, for n=1e18 and p=2, current can be 2^60 which is 1e18, then next_current would be 2^61. But since n is 1e18, current*p may exceed 1e18, so after adding n//current, we break.

            # So, the loop condition is current <=n.

            if next_current >n:

                current = next_current

                break

            current = next_current

        # compute e mod (mod-1)

        e_mod = e % phi_mod

        # multiply result by p^e_mod mod mod

        result = (result * pow(p, e_mod, mod)) % mod

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Another example: input 10,2.

Another test case: 20190929 1605. Let's see, but the code should handle it.

What about x=947 (a prime), and n=987654321987654321. The code would compute e as sum of 987654321987654321 // (947^m) for m=1,2,... until 947^m >n.

But Python can handle very large integers, so no problem.

Thus, the code should work.

Potential optimizations:

- Factorizing x: using a better method. But for x up to 1e9, trial division is acceptable.

- Precomputing primes. Not necessary.

So the code is correct.
