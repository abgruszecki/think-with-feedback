<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem is about simulating operations where we remove certain points based on their neighbors' colors. The goal is to find out how many such operations we can perform until no more points are removed.

First, I need to understand the process. Each operation, we look at all points and check if either their left or right neighbor has a different color. If so, the point gets marked for deletion. All marked points are removed at once in one step. We repeat this until an operation removes nothing.

The challenge is to model this efficiently, especially since the input can be up to 1e6 characters. A naive approach of simulating each step by checking each point and building the next state would be O(n^2) in the worst case, which would be way too slow for n=1e6.

So, the key is to find an algorithm that can compute the number of steps without simulating each operation step-by-step for every point. Let's think about how the deletions happen.

Let's consider each point's contribution to the steps. For example, some points might be deleted in the first step, others in the second, etc. The total steps required would be the maximum step number across all points that get deleted.

So the problem reduces to determining for each point in the original string, during which operation it gets removed, and then the maximum of those values is the answer.

But how do we compute the step in which each point is removed?

Hmm. Let's think of the process as layers. Each point that is removed in the first step is part of the first layer. Then, after removing those, the next layer is determined based on the new neighbors. And so on.

Alternatively, maybe each point's deletion step depends on how far away they are from a "stable" region. For example, points that are sandwiched between two same-color points might never be deleted, unless their neighbors get removed, which could expose them to different colors.

Wait, but the deletions happen in waves. So, for a point to be deleted in step k, it must have at least one neighbor (in the current state of that step) that is of a different color. But the current state depends on previous deletions.

This seems complex. Let's think of some examples.

Take the first example: "aabb". The initial string is a a b b. The first step: check each point.

The first 'a' has a right neighbor 'a' (same color). So no. The second 'a' has a right neighbor 'b' (different color). So it gets deleted. Similarly, the first 'b' has left neighbor 'a' (different) so it's deleted. The last 'b' has left neighbor 'b' (same). So after step 1, the string becomes 'ab', which in step 2, both are deleted. So total steps 2.

In this case, the middle two points are in step 1, and the outer two in step 2. Wait, no. Wait, after the first step, the remaining points are 'a' and 'b', each other's neighbors. So both get deleted in step 2.

So, the key is that each deletion can create new neighbors, leading to new deletions in the next steps.

So, how to model this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model each point's deletion time based on how many adjacent differing colors exist and how they propagate.

I recall a similar problem where you have to compute the time when each cell in a grid becomes rotten, where rotten cells spread to adjacent cells each day. The solution uses BFS, starting with cells that are initially rotten. Maybe we can apply a similar approach here.

In this problem, the points that are removed in the first step are those that have at least one neighbor of different color. Then, in the next steps, their removal might cause their neighbors to now have a neighbor of different color in the next state. So, the deletion times propagate outwards.

So, perhaps we can model this with BFS. Each point's deletion time is the earliest step in which it can be removed, based on the deletion times of its neighbors.

But how?

Let's think: For each point, when will it be removed. The initial points to be removed are those with at least one neighbor of different color. Once those are removed, the remaining points might have new neighbors. For example, if a point A is between B and C. If B and C are removed in step 1, then in step 2, A's neighbors are the points next to B and C. But if B and C are removed, then A's new neighbors are the ones that were next to B and C before B and C were removed.

Wait, perhaps the way to model it is to consider the original string, and for each position, determine how soon it is deleted based on the waves of deletions propagating from the initial differing colors.

Alternatively, here's an idea inspired by the BFS approach:

- For each position, compute the earliest time it will be deleted. The answer is the maximum time across all deleted positions.

The steps to compute this:

1. Initialize a queue with all positions that are to be deleted in step 1. These are positions where either left or right neighbor is of different color.

2. For each position in the queue, determine their deletion time (step 1). Then, for their neighbors, check if they are not already scheduled for deletion, and if their other neighbor (after considering the deletions) now has a different color. If so, schedule them for deletion in the next step.

But how do we track the left and right neighbors as deletions happen? Because when a point is deleted, the left and right of adjacent points become connected.

Wait, this seems similar to the problem of removing elements from a linked list, and needing to track the previous and next elements efficiently. So, perhaps we can model the points as a doubly linked list, where each node keeps track of its left and right neighbors. When a node is deleted, the left and right nodes are connected, and their neighbors updated. Then, in each step, we can check the left and right of each node to see if they are of different color.

But for 1e6 nodes, this approach would be manageable if we can process it efficiently.

But how to compute the deletion times efficiently.

Let me outline the approach:

- Represent the points as a linked list. Each node has a left and right pointer.

- For each node, precompute whether it is going to be deleted in the first step. If yes, add it to a queue with deletion time 1.

- Then, process the queue. For each node being deleted at time t, check its left and right neighbors. For each neighbor, after the current node is deleted, the neighbor's new left and right may change. But since the current node is being deleted, the left and right neighbors of the current node's left and right must be updated.

Wait, perhaps when a node is deleted, we can check its left and right neighbors and see if they now have a neighbor (their new left or right) that is a different color. If so, and if they weren't already scheduled for deletion, then schedule them for deletion at time t+1.

But how do we track the current left and right of each node after deletions?

This requires a way to efficiently track the left and right neighbors of each node as nodes are removed. So, the linked list approach makes sense here.

So, the algorithm steps would be:

1. Initialize a linked list structure for all nodes. Each node has left and right pointers.

2. For each node, check if it has a left or right neighbor with different color. If yes, add to the initial queue with step 1.

3. Mark these nodes as to be deleted in step 1.

4. For each node in the queue:

   a. Record its deletion time.

   b. For each of its left and right neighbors (before deletion), check if they are not already deleted.

   c. For each such neighbor, after the current node is deleted, their left or right neighbor changes. For example, if the current node is the right neighbor of node L, then after deletion, L's right becomes current node's right.

   d. However, we need to process deletions in steps. So, when a node is processed (i.e., deleted in step t), we can look at its left (L) and right (R) neighbors. Then, after deletion, L's right becomes R, and R's left becomes L.

   e. Then, after this, check if L and R now have different colors. If so, and if they were not marked for deletion already, then they can be scheduled for deletion in step t+1.

Wait, but this is a bit tricky. Because when a node is deleted, its left and right neighbors are connected. Then, after the deletion, those neighbors may now have each other as neighbors. So, for example, if node X is between L and R, and X is deleted, then L's right becomes R and R's left becomes L. Then, we need to check if L and R now have different colors. If so, and if either of them wasn't already deleted, then they might be candidates for deletion in the next step.

But how do we track when these changes happen and when the nodes become eligible for deletion.

Alternatively, for each node, the earliest time it can be deleted is determined by the earliest time when one of its neighbors (in the current state) has a different color. But since the neighbors change as deletions happen, we need a way to track these.

This is similar to the BFS approach where each node's deletion time is determined by the earliest step in which it's possible.

So, here's a possible algorithm:

- Each node can be in the queue only once. Once processed (deleted at a certain step), it's marked as deleted.

- For each node in the queue, when it's processed (say, at step t), we check its left and right neighbors (L and R) in the original linked list. But wait, after deletion, L and R become neighbors. So, after processing the current node X (deleting it), L's right is R, and R's left is L.

- Now, we need to check if L and R (after being connected) have different colors. If so, they may need to be deleted in the next step. But how?

Wait, perhaps when X is deleted, we need to check the new neighbors (L and R) for possible deletion in the next step.

But how do we track the current state of the linked list?

An efficient way to model this is to use a data structure that allows us to track, for each node, its current left and right neighbors, even as nodes are deleted.

So, for each node, we can store the left and right pointers. Initially, these are set to their immediate neighbors. When a node is deleted, for each of its left and right neighbors, we update their pointers. For example, if node X has left L and right R, then after deleting X:

- L's right pointer becomes R.

- R's left pointer becomes L.

Then, we can check if L and R now have neighbors (each other) of different colors. If so, and if they haven't been scheduled for deletion yet, they can be added to the queue with step t+1.

But how to efficiently check if L and R are in a state where their colors differ, after the deletion of X.

Wait, the color of L and R are fixed. The deletion of X just connects L and R. So, after X is deleted, L's right is R, and R's left is L. So, for L, its neighbors are now L's previous left (if any) and R. For R, neighbors are L and R's previous right (if any).

So, when X is deleted, after updating L and R's pointers, we can check if L and R need to be considered for deletion in future steps.

But since L and R might have been processed before, we need to check if they are not already deleted and if their current left and right neighbors (after the deletion of X) are of different color.

Wait, but for L, after X is deleted, L's right becomes R. So, L's right neighbor is R. So, if L's color is different from R's color, then L and R will be candidates for deletion in the next step. But how do we check that?

But in this case, after X is deleted, the next step's deletion is determined by the current neighbors. So, for L and R, after X's deletion, their left and right neighbors are their new neighbors. So, to check if they now have a neighbor of different color, we can look at their new left and right.

But how do we track this.

Let me outline the steps:

Initialize:

- For each node, left and right pointers are set to their immediate left and right in the original string.

- For each node, check if left exists and color is different, or right exists and color is different. If yes, add to the initial queue with step 1.

- Also, maintain a visited array or a set to track which nodes have been scheduled for deletion.

Process the queue:

While the queue is not empty:

   Dequeue a node X (current step is t).

   If X is already deleted, skip.

   Mark X as deleted and record its deletion time as t.

   Get left neighbor L of X (before deletion), and right neighbor R of X (before deletion).

   Update L's right pointer to R (if L exists).

   Update R's left pointer to L (if R exists).

   Now, check L and R:

   For each of L and R (if they exist and are not deleted):

      For node Y (either L or R):

         Check if Y's new left or new right (after X's deletion) has a different color.

         For example, Y's left is its current left (after X's deletion), and Y's right is its current right (after X's deletion).

         So, Y's left could be the same as before (if X was Y's right), but after X's deletion, Y's right is R.

         Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after X is deleted, Y (either L or R) has new left and right pointers. So, for Y, we can check:

For Y's current left and right (after X's deletion), if either of them is different in color from Y. If yes, then Y needs to be considered for deletion in step t+1. But how do we do this?

Wait, but Y might have other neighbors besides the ones affected by X's deletion. For example, Y could have a left neighbor that was already processed and deleted. So, when X is deleted, Y's right is R. But Y's left could be another node that was deleted earlier.

So, to check whether Y is to be deleted, we need to look at its current left and right neighbors (after X's deletion) and see if either of them exists and has a different color.

So, after X is deleted, we need to check for both L and R:

For each of L and R:

   If Y (L or R) hasn't been deleted yet, check if Y's left or Y's right (as per the updated pointers) has a different color.

   If either left or right neighbor exists and has a different color, and Y hasn't been scheduled for deletion yet, then schedule Y for step t+1.

But how to efficiently check this?

The steps would be:

After X is deleted, for L:

- new_left = L's left (unchanged, since X was to the right of L)

- new_right = R (since X was L's right, which is now R)

So, L's new neighbors are new_left and new_right.

For L to be deleted in step t+1, either new_left exists and has a different color than L, or new_right exists and has a different color than L.

Similarly for R.

But how can we check this? Because when X is deleted, L and R's pointers are updated. So, after processing X, for L, we can check the current left and right.

So, for L:

left_neighbor = L's left (could be a node that's already deleted)

right_neighbor = R (which may or may not be deleted yet)

Wait, but if R is already deleted, then right_neighbor would be R's right (but R is deleted, so how?)

No, in the linked list structure, once a node is deleted, its left and right pointers are no longer valid. So, during the processing of X, when we update L and R's pointers, we need to ensure that the pointers are to existing nodes (not deleted).

Wait, but when a node is marked as deleted, its left and right pointers can be set to None or some sentinel value. So, during processing, when we check for L and R, we need to make sure that they are still active (not deleted).

So, the steps for processing X (deletion step t):

- Mark X as deleted.

- Get L = X.left (original left before deletion)

- Get R = X.right (original right before deletion)

- If L exists (not None and not deleted), set L.right = R.

- If R exists (not None and not deleted), set R.left = L.

- Now, for L and R:

   For each in [L, R]:

      if the node exists and is not deleted:

         check if (node.left exists and node.left.color != node.color) or (node.right exists and node.right.color != node.color):

            if yes, and if the node hasn't been scheduled yet (i.e., not in the queue already), then schedule it for step t+1.

But how do we track whether a node has been scheduled yet?

We can maintain a scheduled array (a boolean array) which marks whether the node is already in the queue. This is necessary because a node might be added to the queue multiple times (from different neighbors being deleted) but we only want to process it once.

Wait, but once a node is scheduled, and added to the queue, when it's processed, it's marked as deleted and the scheduled flag is reset (or not). Hmm.

Wait, in the BFS approach, each node is processed exactly once. So, the scheduled array can track whether a node is already in the queue. So, when we check if a node (L or R) needs to be scheduled, we first check if it's not already scheduled and not deleted.

So, for example:

When processing X, after updating L and R's pointers:

For each Y in [L, R]:

   if Y is not deleted and not scheduled:

      check if Y has a left or right neighbor of different color.

      if yes:

          add Y to the queue with step t+1.

          mark Y as scheduled.

So, this way, each node is added to the queue once, and processed once.

But how do we check if Y's current neighbors (after X's deletion) have different colors?

Because Y's neighbors could have changed after X's deletion. For example, Y was L, and after X's deletion, Y's right is R. So, we need to check Y's current left and right (after X's deletion) for color differences.

So, for Y:

current_left = Y.left (which could have been updated if previous deletions occurred)

current_right = Y.right (same as above)

So, for Y, the code would be:

if (current_left is not None and current_left.color != Y.color) or (current_right is not None and current_right.color != Y.color):

    then Y must be scheduled.

But how to get current_left and current_right for Y? Because after X's deletion, Y's left and right pointers have been updated.

Yes, because when we updated L's right to R (and R's left to L), Y's pointers are already updated. So, when Y is L, Y's right is R. So, checking Y's right (current) is R.

So, in code, for Y:

current_left = Y.left (could be None if Y is the first node)

current_right = Y.right (could be None if Y is the last node)

if (current_left and current_left.color != Y.color) or (current_right and current_right.color != Y.color):

    schedule Y.

But this needs to be done after X's deletion, so that Y's pointers are correct.

So, the algorithm steps are:

1. Preprocess all nodes, setting their left and right pointers.

2. For each node, check if it has any neighbor (left or right) of different color. If yes, add to the initial queue with step 1. Mark them as scheduled.

3. Process the queue in BFS order:

   a. Dequeue node X.

   b. If X is already deleted, skip.

   c. Mark X as deleted. Record step t.

   d. Get L = X.left, R = X.right.

   e. Update L and R's pointers:

      if L is not None and not deleted: L.right = R.

      if R is not None and not deleted: R.left = L.

   f. For each Y in [L, R]:

      if Y is not None and not deleted and not scheduled:

          check if Y has any current neighbor (Y.left or Y.right) of different color.

          if yes:

              add Y to the queue with step t+1.

              mark Y as scheduled.

4. The answer is the maximum step recorded.

But how to represent the nodes efficiently in Python for 1e6 elements?

In Python, using a list of objects or dictionaries might be slow for 1e6 elements. So, perhaps we can use arrays to store left and right pointers, as well as the scheduled and deleted flags.

Yes. For example, using separate arrays:

left = [0] * n

right = [0] * n

scheduled = [False] * n

deleted = [False] * n

color = list(s)  # the input string.

Then, for each node i:

left[i] = i-1 if i>0 else -1

right[i] = i+1 if i <n-1 else -1

Initially, for each node i, check if (left[i] !=-1 and color[left[i]] != color[i]) or (right[i]!=-1 and color[right[i]] != color[i]):

   if yes, add to queue with step 1, and mark scheduled[i] = True.

Then, process the queue as a deque.

For each i in the queue:

   if deleted[i], skip.

   deleted[i] = True.

   step = ... (we need to track the step for each node, perhaps via a queue that holds (i, step) pairs).

   l = left[i]

   r = right[i]

   # update left and right pointers for l and r.

   if l != -1 and not deleted[l]:

       right[l] = r

   if r != -1 and not deleted[r]:

       left[r] = l

   # check l and r

   for y in [l, r]:

       if y == -1:

           continue

       if deleted[y]:

           continue

       if scheduled[y]:

           continue

       # check if y has any neighbor with different color.

       # current left and right of y are left[y] and right[y]

       # which have been updated if necessary.

       has_diff = False

       if left[y] != -1:

           if color[y] != color[left[y]]:

               has_diff = True

       if not has_diff and right[y] != -1:

           if color[y] != color[right[y]]:

               has_diff = True

       if has_diff:

           scheduled[y] = True

           queue.append( (y, step +1) )

So, each node is processed once. The queue holds tuples of (node index, step). The maximum step encountered is the answer.

This approach would be O(n), as each node is processed once. Each step in the queue takes O(1) time per node, plus checking neighbors. But since each node is checked at most once when it's added to the queue, the overall time is O(n).

This should handle 1e6 nodes efficiently.

Let me test this approach with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1: "aabb" (indices 0:a, 1:a, 2:b, 3:b)

Initial left and right pointers:

left: [ -1, 0, 1, 2 ]

right: [1, 2, 3, -1 ]

Check initial candidates:

For each node i:

i=0:

left is -1. right is 1 (a). color same. no. not added.

i=1:

left is 0 (a). right is 2 (b). a != b. so added to queue. step 1.

i=2:

left is 1 (a). right is 3 (b). a != b. added. step 1.

i=3:

left is 2 (b). same. no.

So initial queue has 1 and 2, step 1.

Processing:

Take i=1, step=1. deleted[1] = True.

left[1] is 0, right[1] is 2.

Update:

For l=0: right[0] becomes 2.

For r=2: left[2] becomes 0.

Check l=0:

y=0. not deleted. not scheduled.

Check y's left (left[0] is -1) and right (right[0] is 2). color of 0 is a. right is 2 (b). different. So has_diff is True. Add to queue with step 2. scheduled[0] = True.

Check r=2:

y=2. not deleted. not scheduled.

Check y's left (0, color a) and right (3, color b). a != b. So has_diff is True. Add to queue with step 2. scheduled[2] = True.

Next, process i=2 (step 1). But it's already deleted (because after processing i=1, the step is 1. But wait, no. Because when we process i=1, we set deleted[1] = True. But the queue entry for i=2 is still there. When processing i=2, check if deleted[2] is True. Initially, no. So process.

Wait, no. Because the initial queue has i=1 and i=2. So first we process i=1, then process i=2.

Processing i=2, step 1:

deleted[2] = True.

left[2] is 0 (after previous update), right[2] is 3.

Update:

For l=0: right[0] becomes 3.

For r=3: left[3] becomes 0.

Check l=0:

y=0. not deleted. but scheduled is already True (from previous step). So no action.

Check r=3:

y=3. not deleted. not scheduled.

Check y's left (0, a) and right (-1). color of 3 is b. left is a. different. So has_diff is True. Add to queue with step 2. scheduled[3] = True.

Now, the queue has (0,2), (2,2), (3,2).

Wait, after processing i=1 and i=2, the next elements in the queue would be (0,2), (2,2?), but when i=2 is processed, step is 1, and after that, adding r=3 to the queue for step 2.

But the queue entries for step 1 are processed first. So after processing the initial queue entries (step 1), the queue entries for step 2 are added.

Now, processing the queue entries for step 2:

Take (0,2). Check deleted[0] is False. So mark as deleted.

l = left[0] = -1.

r = right[0] =3 (after previous update).

Update:

For l=-1, do nothing.

For r=3: left[3] becomes -1.

Check y=l (-1) and r=3.

For y=3:

not deleted. scheduled?

Yes, it was added to queue with step 2. So scheduled[3] is True. So when processing y=3, after deletion of 0, what happens.

Processing i=0, step 2:

deleted[0] = True.

l = -1.

r =3.

Update:

For r=3: left[3] becomes -1.

Check r=3:

y=3. Check if not deleted, not scheduled.

Now, after deletion of 0:

left[3] is -1, right[3] is -1 (original right was 3's right was -1, but after 0's deletion, right[3] remains -1.

So, for y=3:

check left and right. both are -1. So no neighbors. So has_diff is False. So not added to queue.

So after processing 0, no new entries.

Next, process (2,2) but wait, i=2 was already deleted in step 1. So when we process (2,2), check deleted[2] is True, so skip.

Then process (3,2):

i=3. deleted[3] is False.

Mark as deleted. step=2.

left[3] is -1, right[3] is -1.

No left or right to update.

Check l=-1 and r=-1. Nothing added.

So the maximum step is 2.

Which matches the sample.

So the algorithm works for the first sample.

Another sample: "aabcaa" (input 2) → output 1.

Original string is a a b c a a.

Indices 0:a, 1:a, 2:b,3:c,4:a,5:a.

Initial left and right pointers:

left: [-1,0,1,2,3,4]

right: [1,2,3,4,5,-1]

Check initial candidates:

i=0: left is -1. right is 1 (a). same. no.

i=1: left 0 (a). right 2 (b). a vs b. yes. added to queue.

i=2: left 1 (a) vs b. yes. added.

i=3: left 2 (b) vs c. yes. added.

i=4: right 5 (a). same. left is c (3). c vs a. yes. added.

i=5: right is -1. left is a (4). same. no.

So initial queue has i=1,2,3,4, step 1.

Processing step 1:

Process i=1 (step 1):

mark deleted[1] = True.

left[1] is 0, right is 2.

Update:

left 0's right becomes 2.

right 2's left becomes 0.

Check y=0 and 2.

y=0: left is -1, right is 2 (b). color a vs b → different. So added to step 2.

y=2: left is 0 (a), right is 3 (c). a vs b → different. c vs b → different. So added to step 2.

Process i=2 (step 1):

mark deleted[2] = True.

left was 0, right was3.

Update:

left 0's right becomes3.

right 3's left becomes0.

Check y=0 and 3.

y=0: left is -1, right is3 (c). a vs c → different. added to step2.

y=3: left is0 (a), color c. a vs c → different. added to step2.

Process i=3 (step1):

mark deleted[3] = True.

left was0, right was4.

Update:

left 0's right becomes4.

right 4's left becomes0.

Check y=0 and4.

y=0: right is4 (a). same. left is -1. no. not added.

y=4: left is0 (a), right is5 (a). a vs a. no. but left is a, same. right is a. same. So no. So not added.

Process i=4 (step1):

mark deleted[4] = True.

left was3 (c, but deleted?), but during processing i=4's left is 3 (deleted now?), but how?

Wait, when processing i=4, which is part of the initial queue (step1):

left[4] is 3 (which was marked as deleted in step1 when processing i=3).

right[4] is5.

Update:

For left[4] =3 (deleted):

so when updating, since 3 is deleted, we do nothing.

For right[4] =5:

left[5] was4. update to -1? No, because during processing i=4, which is now deleted, we have:

left =4's left (3, but deleted), right =4's right (5).

So:

For l=3 (deleted), so no update.

For r=5: set left[5] to 4's left (3, which is deleted). So no, because 4's left is 3, which is deleted, so left[5] becomes 3, but 3 is deleted. So in the code:

when processing i=4, l is left[i] =3 (deleted, so no action), r is right[i]=5 (not deleted).

So for r=5:

left[r] =4, which is being deleted. So update left[r] =3. But 3 is already deleted. So no.

Wait, no. The code for processing i=4 is:

i=4 is being processed. left[i] is3. right[i] is5.

In code:

l = left[i] =3

r = right[i] =5

if l is not None and not deleted: set l's right to r.

But l=3 is deleted (marked in step1). So no action for l.

if r is not None and not deleted: set r's left to l (3). But l=3 is deleted. So, even though r=5 is not deleted, we set left[5] =3 (which is deleted). But then, when checking for r=5, if the code checks whether the left or right of 5 is not deleted.

But in the code, when checking if a neighbor exists, we check whether the index is valid (i.e., not -1), but the code does not check whether that neighbor is deleted. Because in the linked list structure, left and right pointers point to existing (non-deleted) nodes. So, perhaps after updating left and right pointers, the code may have pointers to deleted nodes, but those are ignored in the neighbor checks.

Wait, for example, after processing i=4, r=5's left is set to 3 (which is deleted). So, in the code, when checking y=5 (r of i=4):

current_left = left[5] =3 (deleted). So current_left exists (index 3 is not -1), but is deleted. So in the code, when checking if current_left's color is different, we need to check if it's not deleted.

Wait, no. The code for checking if a neighbor exists and has a different color:

For Y=5:

current_left = left[Y] =3. But since Y=5's left is3, and 3 is deleted, then during the check, current_left is3, but the code checks if current_left is not None (i.e., not -1) and then checks color. But in this case, current_left is3, which is a deleted node. So color[3] is 'c', but since the node is deleted, it's no longer part of the current structure.

So, the code would incorrectly consider Y=5's left neighbor (3) as existing and check its color, but the node 3 has been deleted. So this is a problem.

This indicates a flaw in the algorithm. Because when a node's left or right pointers point to a deleted node, we should not consider those as existing neighbors.

So, the code's current approach of checking if the left or right neighbor is not -1 is insufficient. Because even if the index is valid (non -1), the node might be deleted.

Therefore, in the code, when checking if a neighbor exists and has a different color, we need to check not only if the index is not -1, but also if that neighbor is not deleted.

So, for Y:

has_diff = False

current_left = left[y]

if current_left != -1 and not deleted[current_left]:

    if color[y] != color[current_left]:

        has_diff = True

current_right = right[y]

if not has_diff and current_right != -1 and not deleted[current_right]:

    if color[y] != color[current_right]:

        has_diff = True

If this is the case, then in the sample input 2, after processing i=4 (step1), the code would check:

For Y=5 (r of i=4):

current_left is3 (deleted), so current_left !=-1 but deleted. So current_left is invalid.

current_right is -1. So no neighbors. So has_diff is False. So Y=5 is not added to the queue.

Thus, after processing all initial candidates (i=1,2,3,4) in step1, the queue for step2 would have entries added during processing i=1,2,3.

Let's see:

When processing i=1 (step1):

y=0 and y=2.

y=0: check if any neighbors not deleted and different color.

current_left is left[0] = -1. current_right is right[0] =2 (which is being processed in step1. But when processing i=1, after deleting i=1, the right of 0 is 2.

But when processing y=0 (after i=1's deletion), which is added to the queue for step2.

When processing i=0 in step2:

check current_left (left[0] =-1) and current_right (right[0] =3, which is deleted (i=3 was processed in step1)).

So for y=0 (step2):

current_left is -1.

current_right is3 (deleted). So no valid neighbors. has_diff is False. So no addition.

But during processing i=1, when adding y=0 and y=2 to step2.

Processing i=2 (step1):

y=0 and3.

y=0 is added to step2.

y=3 (step2) is added.

When processing i=3 (step1):

y=0 and4.

y=0 is added to step2.

y=4 is processed in step1.

But during step1 processing of i=3:

mark as deleted.

Update left=0's right to4. (i=3's left is0, right is4).

But when processing i=3, after deletion:

For y=0:

current_right is4. But 4 is deleted (processed in step1).

So in the code:

when checking y=0's current_right (4) is not -1, but deleted[4] is True.

So no, has_diff is false.

But during processing i=3, when checking y=0:

current_left is -1. current_right is4 (deleted).

Thus, no.

So for step2, the queue has i=0 (added during i=1 processing), i=2 (added during i=1 processing?), i=0 (added during i=2 processing?), and i=3 (added during i=2 processing).

Wait, perhaps the code would have multiple entries for the same node. But since the scheduled array is marked as True once the node is added to the queue, the code would prevent adding it again.

But let's see:

When processing i=1 (step1):

y=0 is checked. since not deleted and not scheduled, add to queue step2. scheduled[0] = True.

Then, when processing i=2 (step1):

y=0 is already scheduled, so no.

Then, when processing i=3 (step1):

y=0 is already scheduled.

So, after step1 processing, the queue has i=0, step2; i=2, step2; i=3, step2; i=4, step1 (but i=4 is processed in step1, and during that processing, added nothing).

But during processing i=0 in step2:

when checking its current neighbors, which are left=-1 (invalid) and right=3 (deleted). So no neighbors. So not added.

Similarly, when processing i=3 in step2:

current neighbors are left=0 (but 0's right is3, which is deleted). So no.

Thus, after step2, no new additions. The maximum step is 1.

Wait, but wait. What about the step2 processing.

No, because the initial maximum step is 1. Because all the nodes added to step2 are processed, but in step2, when we process them, their deletion steps are recorded as 2. But in the sample input 2, the answer is 1. So this suggests a problem.

Ah! Because in the sample input 2, after step1, the remaining nodes are 0,5. Which are both 'a's. So no neighbors of different color. So the maximum step is 1.

But according to the algorithm, some nodes are added to step2. However, after processing step1, their deletion steps would be recorded, but the nodes may not actually be deleted.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the algorithm.

Wait, the sample input 2:

Original string: aabcaa → "a a b c a a".

Initial deletions in step1:

i=1,2,3,4.

After step1:

nodes 0 and 5 remain. They are 'a' and 'a', adjacent. But according to the algorithm, after step1, when processing i=1 (step1), after deletion, the right of 0 is 2 (i=1 is deleted, so 0's right is 2). But during processing i=1's deletion, 0's right is updated to 2. Then, during processing i=2's deletion, 0's right is updated to3. Then, during i=3's deletion, 0's right is updated to4. Then, during i=4's deletion, 0's right is updated to5.

Wait, no. Let's walk through step1 processing:

Processing i=1 (step1):

left[1] is0, right[1] is2.

Update 0's right to 2.

Update 2's left to0.

So after this, node 0's right is2 (which is not deleted yet).

Then, processing i=2 (step1):

left[2] is0, right[2] is3.

Update 0's right to3.

Update 3's left to0.

So now, node0's right is3.

Processing i=3 (step1):

left[3] is0, right[3] is4.

Update 0's right to4.

Update4's left to0.

So node0's right is4.

Processing i=4 (step1):

left[4] is3 (deleted), right[4] is5.

Update 3's right to5 (but 3 is deleted, so no action.

Update5's left to3 (but 3 is deleted. So after processing i=4's deletion, node5's left becomes3 (which is deleted).

So after all step1 deletions:

node0's right is4 (which is deleted). node5's left is3 (deleted).

So, node0 and node5 are now adjacent?

No. Because after processing i=4, node0's right is4 (deleted), so node0's right is4, which is deleted. So, after deletion of 4, node0's right is5?

No. Let's see:

During processing i=4:

l = left[i=4] =3 (deleted), so no action.

r=5 (not deleted).

So, for r=5:

set left[r=5] = l=3 (deleted). But since l=3 is deleted, but during processing i=4, after deletion, left[5] is3.

But node3 is deleted, so node5's left is3 (deleted). So, node0's right is4 (deleted), and node5's left is3 (deleted). So, node0 and node5 are not connected. They are isolated nodes.

Thus, in the linked list structure, after step1, node0's right is4 (deleted), and node5's left is3 (deleted). So, node0 and node5 are not connected. So, they have no neighbors, so no further deletions. So step2 would not process anything.

But according to the algorithm, during step1 processing, some nodes are added to the queue for step2.

For example, processing i=1 (step1) adds y=0 and y=2 to step2.

Processing i=2 (step1) adds y=0 and y=3 to step2.

Processing i=3 (step1) adds y=0 and y=4 to step2.

Processing i=4 (step1) adds y=5 to step2?

Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

When processing i=4 (step1):

y's are l=3 (deleted) and r=5.

For y=5:

check if it's not deleted and not scheduled.

y=5 is not deleted. scheduled? No.

Check if y's current left or right neighbors (after deletion of i=4) have different colors.

current_left of y=5 is3 (deleted). So, even though left is3, which is deleted, the code checks:

current_left = left[y=5] =3.

But since deleted[3] is True, the code will not consider it as a valid neighbor.

current_right is -1.

So, for y=5:

if (current_left !=-1 and not deleted) → 3 is deleted. So, no.

current_right is -1. So, no.

Thus, y=5 is not added to the queue.

Thus, the code for sample input2 would have:

After step1, the queue has entries for step2 (i=0, i=2, i=3, i=0, i=3, i=0).

But these are all scheduled, but when processed in step2:

i=0:

check if it's not deleted.

Yes. So mark as deleted. step=2.

l= -1, r=5.

Update:

for l=-1, nothing.

for r=5:

left[5] is3 (deleted), so no update.

Check y=5:

current_left is3 (deleted), current_right is-1. So no.

Thus, after processing i=0 in step2, the answer would be 2, which is wrong. But the sample output is 1.

Ah! So this indicates that the algorithm is incorrect.

So, what's the problem here.

The issue is that during step1 processing, the algorithm marks nodes for deletion even if their new neighbors are deleted. For example, when processing i=1 (step1), after deletion, node0's right is2 (node2 is not deleted yet). So node0 is added to the queue for step2. But node2 is then processed in step1, which updates node0's right to3. Then, node3 is processed in step1, updating node0's right to4. Then, node4 is processed in step1, updating node0's right to5. So, during step1 processing, node0's right is changing, but the code adds node0 to the queue based on its state after i=1's deletion. But the subsequent deletions during step1 modify node0's right. However, the code adds node0 to the queue for step2, but during step2, node0's right is5 (a), which is same color.

But node0's scheduled for step2 because during i=1's processing, its right was2 (b), which was different from a. But after step1 processing, node0's right becomes5 (a), which is same color. But the code has already added node0 to the queue for step2.

Thus, the algorithm may incorrectly schedule nodes for deletion in a step where they no longer have differing neighbors.

This is a problem.

The root cause is that when a node is added to the queue for a certain step, the code does not re-check its neighbors at the time of processing. So, during the time between being added to the queue and being processed, the node's neighbors may have changed (due to deletions in the same step), leading to the node no longer being eligible for deletion.

Thus, the algorithm's current approach may overcount steps.

How to handle this?

In other words, when a node is scheduled for step t, but during the processing of previous nodes in step t-1, its neighbors may have changed, making it no longer eligible for deletion in step t.

Thus, when processing a node in the queue, we need to re-check whether it actually has any neighbors of different color.

In the current algorithm, when a node is added to the queue, it's added based on the state of its neighbors at the time of the parent node's deletion. But by the time the node is processed, its neighbors may have changed.

So, the correct approach is: when processing a node from the queue (step t), we first check whether it still has any neighbors of different color. If not, we skip processing it.

This adds an extra check when dequeuing a node.

So, modifying the algorithm:

When dequeuing a node X (step t):

- If X is already deleted, skip.

- Check if X has any neighbor (left or right) that is not deleted and has a different color.

   If not, skip processing X.

   Else, mark X as deleted, proceed to update its neighbors, and schedule any eligible neighbors.

This way, nodes that were scheduled for deletion in step t but no longer have differing neighbors are skipped.

This extra check is necessary to ensure that the node is still eligible for deletion in the current state.

So, the revised algorithm steps:

Processing the queue:

For each (X, t) dequeued:

   if deleted[X] is True → skip.

   check if X has any neighbor (left or right) that is not deleted and has a different color.

   if not → skip.

   else:

      mark deleted[X] = True.

      record step t.

      update left and right pointers.

      check L and R as before.

Thus, in the sample input2, when node0 is dequeued in step2:

Check if node0 has any neighbors not deleted and different color.

node0's left is -1.

node0's right is5 (a). same color.

So, no. Thus, the code skips processing node0, and it is not marked as deleted.

Thus, the maximum step remains 1.

This revised algorithm would produce the correct answer.

So, the key fix is to add a check when dequeuing a node to see if it still has any eligible neighbors. If not, skip deletion.

This complicates the algorithm but is necessary for correctness.

So, in code:

When dequeuing (X, step):

   if deleted[X] → skip.

   current_left = left[X]

   current_right = right[X]

   has_diff = False

   if current_left != -1 and not deleted[current_left] and color[X] != color[current_left]:

       has_diff = True

   elif current_right != -1 and not deleted[current_right] and color[X] != color[current_right]:

       has_diff = True

   if not has_diff:

       scheduled[X] = False  # Allow it to be re-scheduled if necessary?

       continue

   else:

       mark as deleted.

       proceed with updating left and right.

This additional check ensures that the node is only deleted if it still has a differing neighbor.

But how to handle this.

In code:

For each node X dequeued:

   if deleted[X] → continue.

   current_left = left[X]

   current_right = right[X]

   has_diff = False

   if current_left != -1 and not deleted[current_left] and color[X] != color[current_left]:

       has_diff = True

   if not has_diff and current_right != -1 and not deleted[current_right] and color[X] != color[current_right]:

       has_diff = True

   if not has_diff:

       scheduled[X] = False  # So that it can be re-scheduled in the future if needed.

       continue

   # Proceed to delete X.

   deleted[X] = True

   max_step = max(max_step, step)

   l = left[X]

   r = right[X]

   # Update pointers.

   if l != -1 and not deleted[l]:

       right[l] = r

   if r != -1 and not deleted[r]:

       left[r] = l

   # Check L and R.

   for y in [l, r]:

       if y == -1:

           continue

       if deleted[y]:

           continue

       # Check if y should be added to the queue.

       # Check if y has any neighbor (left or right) that is not deleted and has different color.

       has_diff_y = False

       y_left = left[y]

       y_right = right[y]

       if y_left != -1 and not deleted[y_left] and color[y] != color[y_left]:

           has_diff_y = True

       elif y_right != -1 and not deleted[y_right] and color[y] != color[y_right]:

           has_diff_y = True

       if has_diff_y and not scheduled[y]:

           scheduled[y] = True

           queue.append( (y, step+1) )

This way, when a node is dequeued, we check if it still has a valid neighbor of different color. If not, we skip processing it and mark it as not scheduled, allowing it to be reconsidered if other changes occur.

But this is more computationally intensive, but necessary for correctness.

Thus, the algorithm is now correct.

So, with this fix, the sample input2's node0, when dequeued in step2, is found to have no valid differing neighbors and is skipped. So, the maximum step remains 1.

This solves the problem.

Now, the code can be implemented in Python.

But considering the input size of up to 1e6, the code must be efficient.

In Python, using arrays for left and right pointers, and deque for the queue should be efficient enough.

Now, let's write the code.

The steps are:

Read the input string.

Initialize n = len(s).

If n is 0, output 0.

Initialize left and right arrays.

For each i in range(n):

   left[i] = i-1 if i>0 else -1

   right[i] = i+1 if i <n-1 else -1

Initialize scheduled = [False]*n

deleted = [False]*n

max_step =0

Initialize queue as deque.

For each i in range(n):

   current_left = left[i]

   current_right = right[i]

   has_diff = False

   if current_left != -1 and s[current_left] != s[i]:

       has_diff = True

   elif current_right != -1 and s[current_right] != s[i]:

       has_diff = True

   if has_diff:

       scheduled[i] = True

       queue.append( (i, 1) )

Process the queue:

from collections import deque

q = deque()

... 

Then process as per the algorithm.

So, the code:

import sys
from collections import deque

def main():
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    n = len(s)
    if n ==0:
        print(0)

    scheduled = [False]*n
    deleted = [False]*n
    max_step =0
    q = deque()
    # Initial check

        if current_left != -1 and color[current_left] != color[i]:
            has_diff = True

        if current_left != -1 and not deleted[current_left] and color[current_left] != color[x]:
            has_diff = True
        elif current_right != -1 and not deleted[current_right] and color[current_right] != color[x]:
            has_diff = True
        if not has_diff:

        r = right[x]
        if l != -1 and not deleted[l]:
            right[l] = r
        if r != -1 and not deleted[r]:
            left[r] = l
        # Check l and r
        for y in [l, r]:
            if y == -1 or deleted[y]:
                continue
            # Check if y has any valid differing neighbors
            y_left = left[y]
            y_right = right[y]
            has_diff_y = False
            if y_left != -1 and not deleted[y_left] and color[y_left] != color[y]:
                has_diff_y = True
            elif y_right != -1 and not deleted[y_right] and color[y_right] != color[y]:
                has_diff_y = True
            if has_diff_y and not scheduled[y]:
                scheduled[y] = True
                q.append( (y, step +1) )
    print(max_step)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Testing this code on sample input1:

Input "aabb" → output 2.

Sample input2 "aabcaa" → output 1.

So the code should work.
