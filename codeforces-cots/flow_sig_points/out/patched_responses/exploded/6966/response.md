Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given a variable name and a value, I have to create the Hungarian notation prefix. The problem says that integers get 'i' and real numbers get 'f'. Then the variable name's first letter is capitalized and the prefix is added.

First, I need to determine if the given value is an integer or a real. The input for the value is a string. So how do I check that? Let's think. The integer case is when there's no decimal point. But wait, the problem says that real numbers are written with a mandatory decimal point. So for example, if the value string has a '.', then it's a real, otherwise integer.

Wait, but the second line's constraints mention that the value is a string of digits and zero or one decimal points. Also, the decimal point is not the last character. So, the presence of a '.' means it's a real number, and absence means integer. That's the key. So the first thing to do is check if the second input string contains a '.'.

So the steps are:

1. Read the two lines: the variable name and the value.
2. Check if the value contains a '.'.
3. If yes, then the prefix is 'f' (real). Otherwise, 'i' (integer).
4. Take the variable name, capitalize the first letter, and prepend the prefix.

But wait, the variable name is given in lowercase. So for example, if the name is "count", the meaningful part becomes "Count", then add 'i' or 'f' in front. So for the first example, input 'count' and '18', the output is 'iCount'.

So the code steps would be:

Read the variable name (s) and the value (v).

Check if '.' is in v. If so, prefix is 'f', else 'i'.

Then, process the variable name: capitalize the first character, then append the rest as lowercase. Wait, the problem says the variable name is given as a string of lowercase letters. So the input is already in lowercase. So for the name, we just need to capitalize the first letter. For example, 'count' becomes 'Count'.

So the transformed name is s[0].upper() + s[1:].

Then, combine the prefix and the transformed name.

So putting it all together:

prefix = 'i' if '.' not in value else 'f'

result = prefix + s[0].upper() + s[1:]

Yes. That's the core logic.

Now, considering edge cases. Let's see.

What if the value is something like '0.5'? Then it's real, so 'f'.

If the value is '123', no '.' so 'i'.

What if the value is '.5'? According to the problem statement, the input ensures that the decimal point is not the last character. So '.5' is allowed and is a real number. So in that case, check for '.' in the string. So yes, prefix is 'f'.

Another case: '3.14', which is real.

So the logic is solid.

Now, code-wise:

Read the two lines. The first line is the variable name. The second line is the value.

In Python, input().strip() for both. Then check for '.' in the value string.

Then construct the prefix.

Then capitalize the first letter of the variable name.

So the code could be written as:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    v = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    if '.' in v:
        prefix = 'f'
    else:
        prefix = 'i'

    var_part = s[0].upper() + s[1:]
    print(prefix + var_part, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
weight
3.95
""",
            "output": \
"""\
fWeight
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second example: weight and 3.95. '.' present â†’ 'f' + 'Weight' â†’ fWeight. Correct.

Another test case: variable 'a' and value '.9' â†’ 'fA'.

Another test: variable 'number' and value '123' â†’ 'iNumber'.

Yes. That should work.

So the code seems correct. Let's see if there's any possible edge cases.

What if the value is '100.'? Wait, the problem states that in the input, the decimal point will not be the last character. So that's not allowed. The input is guaranteed to have the value with decimal point not last. So the code is safe.

So the code is straightforward. No issues with leading zeros or anything else because the problem's input is valid as per the constraints.

So this should be the correct and optimal solution. Since it's O(1) time (checking for a character in a string of up to 11 characters is negligible), and the operations are minimal. So it's efficient in both time and memory.

s = input().strip()
v = input().strip()
prefix = 'f' if '.' in v else 'i'
print(prefix + s[0].upper() + s[1:])
