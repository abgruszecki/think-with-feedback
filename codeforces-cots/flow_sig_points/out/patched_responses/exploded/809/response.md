<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to parse it carefully.

So, the robot starts at (x0, y0) and follows a sequence of commands. Each test case is a unique mine placement on the grid. For each possible mine position (excluding the starting cell, because the tests are exactly x*y tests and each mine is in a unique cell), we need to determine when the robot steps on that mine, if ever. The answer is the count of mines that cause the robot to explode exactly after k steps, for k from 0 to the length of the command string.

Wait, no. Wait, the mine is placed in a cell. Then, during the robot's movement, whenever the robot is on the mine's cell, it explodes. So the mine could be hit during any step, including the starting position (step 0). But the robot's starting position is (x0, y0). So if the mine is placed there, then the robot explodes at step 0. Otherwise, during each step of the command execution, if the robot moves into the mine's cell, that's when it explodes. If it never steps on the mine, then it explodes after executing all commands (because of the code bug). But in that case, how do we count? Because the mine was placed, but the robot didn't hit it. So that test contributes to the count at k = length(s).

So, for each mine position (excluding the starting cell?), wait no. Wait, the problem says that each test uses a square that has never been used before. So exactly x*y tests. The starting cell is (x0, y0). So in each test, the mine is placed in a unique cell. So the starting cell is one of them, right? Because the mine can be placed there. So in that case, if the mine is placed in (x0, y0), then the robot explodes at step 0. Otherwise, during movement steps.

So the output is an array of length len(s)+1, where each element at position k is the number of tests where the robot exploded exactly after k commands. So for each mine, we need to find the earliest time (step) when the robot is on that mine. If it's never on the mine, then the k is len(s).

So the plan is:

1. Simulate the robot's path, including all positions it occupies during each step. For each step (including step 0, which is the initial position), record the positions.

2. For each mine position (all possible cells except the starting cell?), no, wait: each test uses exactly one cell. So all cells are used once. So for each cell (i,j), if (i,j) is the starting cell, then the mine is placed here, and the robot will explode at step 0. But if (i,j) is any other cell, then we need to check when the robot steps on (i,j) for the first time.

Wait, no. Because the robot starts at (x0,y0) in every test. The mine is placed in a cell that hasn't been used before. So each test uses a different cell. So for the test where the mine is in (x0,y0), the robot is on that cell at step 0, so it explodes immediately. For other tests, the mine is placed in a cell that's not the starting position. So in that case, we need to track when the robot first steps onto that mine cell. If it does so during step k (the k-th move), then that test contributes to the count for k. If the robot never steps on the mine cell during any step (including step 0), then the test contributes to the count for len(s) steps.

Wait, step 0 is the starting position. So for a mine placed at (x0,y0), the explosion is at step 0. For any other mine cell (i,j), the earliest step where the robot is on (i,j) is when the explosion occurs. If it's never on (i,j) during any step (including step 0), then the explosion is after all commands, which is step len(s).

So the problem reduces to:

For each cell (i,j) in the grid:

- If (i,j) is the starting cell: contributes to k=0.

Else:

- Find the earliest step (from 0 to len(s)) where the robot is at (i,j). If found, contribute to that step. If not, contribute to len(s).

But how do we track this efficiently, given that the command string can be up to 1e5 characters?

The grid is up to 500x500, so 250,000 cells. The commands are up to 1e5 steps. So for each cell, we need to find the first occurrence in the robot's path.

So the approach is:

1. Precompute the entire path of the robot. For each step, record the coordinates. The steps are from 0 (starting position) to len(s) (after all commands).

Wait, the steps are 0 (before any command is executed), then after the first command (step 1), then after second command (step 2), etc. So for a command string of length N, there are N+1 steps (0 to N).

Wait, no. Let's think. Let's say the command sequence is "UDRL". Then:

- Step 0: starting position.

- After first command (U), step 1.

- After second command (D), step 2.

- etc. So the total steps are N+1? Or N steps? Wait, the commands are executed in sequence. So for each command, there's a movement (if possible). So for each command, the robot's position changes (or not, if the movement is impossible). The explosion can happen at any time during the movement. So for the initial position (step 0), if the mine is there, then the explosion is at step 0. Then, after each command, the robot moves. So for each of the N commands, there's a step where the position is updated.

Wait, the problem statement says: "as soon as the robot fulfills all the sequence of commands, it will blow up due to a bug in the code. But if at some moment of time the robot is at the same square with the mine, it will also blow up, but not due to a bug in the code."

So the robot can explode during the processing of the commands. So for each step k (from 0 to len(s)), if during the processing of the first k commands the robot is in the mine's position, then it explodes at step k. Wait, perhaps step 0 is before any command is executed. Then step 1 is after the first command, step 2 after the second, etc. So the steps are 0 (initial), 1 (after first command), ..., len(s) (after all commands). So the total possible steps where the robot can explode are len(s)+1 possibilities.

So the output array has len(s)+1 elements. For each mine cell (i,j), we need to find the earliest step in the robot's path where (i,j) is visited. Then, increment the count for that step. If it's never visited (except for the starting cell case), then the step is len(s).

Wait, the starting cell is (x0,y0). So the mine can be placed here. For that mine, the robot is there at step 0. So the count for k=0 increases by 1. For other cells, if the robot's path includes (i,j) at step t (t can be 0 if (i,j) is (x0,y0) again?), but no, (x0,y0) is the starting cell, and other cells are considered as mines in different tests.

So for a cell (i,j) not the starting cell, if the robot steps on it at step t (t could be 0, but since the starting position is (x0,y0), unless the path revisits the starting cell at step t>0, but that's possible). For example, in the second sample input, the robot starts at (2,2) and the commands are U, L, D. Let's see:

Sample Input 2:

2 2 2 2

ULD

Sample Output: 1 1 1 1

So the robot's path is:

Step 0: (2,2). So if mine is here, count[0] +=1.

Then, first command U: try to move up. Since x is 2 (max x is 2), moving up would decrease x. So x becomes 1. So step 1 is (1,2).

Second command L: move left. y decreases from 2 to 1. So step 2 is (1,1).

Third command D: move down. x increases from 1 to 2. Step 3 is (2,1).

So all steps are:

0: (2,2)

1: (1,2)

2: (1,1)

3: (2,1)

So for each mine cell:

If mine is (2,2): step 0.

Other cells:

(1,2): step 1.

(1,1): step 2.

(2,1): step 3.

So the output counts are 1 (step 0) +1 (step 1) +1 (step 2) +1 (step 3) = 4, which matches the output of 1 1 1 1 (since the command length is 3, the array has 4 elements).

So for each cell, except the starting cell, the earliest occurrence in the robot's path (steps 0 to len(s)) determines which step count it contributes to.

But wait, the starting cell is (x0,y0). So if the robot's path returns to (x0,y0) in step t>0, then the mine placed at (x0,y0) is already considered in the first test. But for other tests, the mine can't be placed there again. So in those steps, it's possible that the robot is on (x0,y0) again, but those steps would not be considered because the mine in those positions is already tested in the first test.

Wait, but each mine is placed in a unique cell once. So the starting cell is one of the possible mine positions. So in that case, if the mine is placed at (x0,y0), the robot explodes at step 0, contributing to count[0]. All other mines are in other cells, and their earliest occurrence in the path (steps 0 to len(s)) is considered.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the robot's entire path for all steps (including step 0 and up to len(s)).

2. For each cell (i,j):

   a. If (i,j) is (x0,y0), then contribute 1 to count[0].

   b. Else, find the earliest step t where the robot is at (i,j). If such t exists, contribute 1 to count[t]. Else, contribute 1 to count[len(s)].

3. Sum all these contributions for each cell and output the counts from 0 to len(s).

But the problem is that the command string can be up to 1e5 characters. So the robot's path can be up to 1e5+1 steps (including step 0). For each step, we need to track the current position, but we also need to record the first time each cell is visited.

But how do we efficiently track the first occurrence of each cell in the robot's path?

The grid is up to 500x500 cells. So for each cell, we can keep track of the earliest step when it's visited. Initially, all cells (except the starting cell) have their earliest step set to infinity. The starting cell's earliest step is 0.

Then, as we simulate the robot's movement step by step (from step 1 to len(s)), for each step, we check the current position. For that position, if it's the first time we are here (earliest step is infinity), we record the current step as the earliest. Otherwise, we do nothing.

Once we've processed all steps, for each cell (i,j), the earliest step is the minimum between 0 (if it's the starting cell) and the earliest step found during simulation. Then, the contribution is:

- If (i,j) is the starting cell: count[0] +=1.

- Else, if earliest step is not infinity: count[earliest step] +=1.

- Else: count[len(s)] +=1.

Wait, but for the starting cell, the earliest step is 0, and the mine placed there contributes to count[0]. So for the rest of the cells (excluding the starting cell), we check their earliest step. If earliest step is found (i.e., not infinity), then the count for that step is incremented. Otherwise, they contribute to len(s).

So this approach would work. The key is to precompute for each cell (except the starting cell) the first occurrence in the path.

So the steps to implement:

1. Initialize a 2D array (steps) of size x rows and y columns. All initialized to infinity.

2. The starting cell (x0-1, y0-1) (assuming 0-based indexing) has steps[x0-1][y0-1] = 0.

3. For other cells, steps[i][j] = infinity.

4. Simulate the robot's movement step by step. For each step from 1 to len(s), compute the current position (current_x, current_y) based on the previous position and the command.

   a. For each command in the sequence, compute the next position.

   b. Check if the next position is within the grid. If not, stay in the same position.

   c. For the current position (after applying the command), if steps[i][j] is still infinity, set it to the current step (which is the step number, starting from 1 to len(s)).

   d. Move to the next step.

5. After processing all commands, for each cell (i,j):

   a. If (i,j) is (x0-1, y0-1), add 1 to count[0].

   b. Else:

      i. If steps[i][j] is not infinity, add 1 to count[steps[i][j]].

      ii. Else, add 1 to count[len(s)].

6. The count array is then the answer.

But wait, in step 4c, we set steps[i][j] only if it's the first time. So for each cell, the earliest step is stored.

But the robot's path could revisit a cell multiple times, but we only record the first occurrence.

This approach is feasible because the grid is 500x500 (250,000 cells), and the command sequence is 1e5 steps. So simulating each step and checking the current cell is O(1e5) steps, which is manageable.

But how to handle the grid coordinates correctly?

We need to represent the grid with (i,j) where i is the row (x coordinate) and j is the column (y coordinate). The starting position is (x0, y0). But in the problem statement, the robot's movement is:

- Moving left decreases y, right increases y.

- Moving up decreases x, moving down increases x.

Wait, the problem says:

"Moving to the left decreases coordinate y, and moving to the right increases it. Similarly, moving up decreases the x coordinate, and moving down increases it."

But the grid is x rows and y columns. So for example, if the robot is at (x0, y0) (1-based) and moves up, the x coordinate decreases by 1. But since x is the row, moving up would take it to (x0-1, y0) (if possible).

So the initial position is (x0, y0) (1-based), which we can convert to 0-based (x0-1, y0-1).

So during simulation, for each command:

- 'L': j decreases by 1.

- 'R': j increases by 1.

- 'U': i decreases by 1.

- 'D': i increases by 1.

But need to check if the new position is within 0 <= i < x and 0 <= j < y.

So for the simulation:

Initialize current_i = x0-1, current_j = y0-1.

For each command in s:

   new_i = current_i

   new_j = current_j

   if command is 'L' and current_j > 0:

       new_j -=1

   elif command is 'R' and current_j < y-1:

       new_j +=1

   elif command is 'U' and current_i >0:

       new_i -=1

   elif command is 'D' and current_i < x-1:

       new_i +=1

   else:

       # movement not possible, new_i and new_j remain the same

   # now, check if new_i and new_j have been visited before

   if steps[new_i][new_j] == infinity:

       steps[new_i][new_j] = current_step

   # then update current_i and current_j for next step

   current_i, current_j = new_i, new_j

Wait, but the step numbers start at 1. Because step 0 is the starting position, step 1 is after the first command.

So for the first command, after processing it, the current position is step 1.

So in the steps array, the starting position is 0, then each step after a command increments the step count.

So during the simulation:

steps is initialized with all infinity except the starting cell (0).

current_i, current_j = x0-1, y0-1.

current_step starts at 1.

for each command in s:

   process the command, compute new_i and new_j.

   if new_i and new_j are within the grid, then check steps[new_i][new_j]. If it's infinity, set it to current_step.

   current_i and current_j become new_i and new_j.

   current_step +=1.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Each command corresponds to a step. So for example, the first command is processed, and the new position is step 1. The steps array for the new position is set to 1 if not already set.

Wait, no. The first step (after first command) is step 1. So the steps array for the new position after first command is set to 1, if it's the first time.

Yes. So the loop is:

current_step = 1

for cmd in s:

   compute new position based on cmd.

   if new position is not visited (steps[new_i][new_j] is infinity), set steps[new_i][new_j] = current_step.

   update current position.

   current_step +=1.

But wait, after processing all commands, the number of steps processed is len(s) steps. So current_step ranges from 1 to len(s).

So the steps array is filled with the first occurrence step (1-based) for each cell. The starting cell's step is 0.

So now, for each cell (i,j):

if (i,j) is the starting cell: count 1 to step 0.

else:

if steps[i][j] is not infinity: count 1 to steps[i][j].

else: count 1 to len(s) (which is len(s) steps, since steps are 0-based up to len(s)).

Wait, no. The step numbers for the commands are 1 to len(s). So after all commands, the robot is at step len(s). So the steps array for the cells visited during the commands (steps 1 to len(s)).

So for a cell that is first visited during the first command (step 1), steps[i][j] is 1.

So when processing each cell (i,j):

if (i,j) is the starting cell: contribute to step 0.

else:

if steps[i][j] is not infinity: contribute to step steps[i][j].

else: contribute to len(s) (because the robot completes all commands and then explodes).

Wait, no. Because the steps array is filled with the step numbers (1-based) for when the cell is first visited. So for example, if the robot first steps into (i,j) during the third command (step 3), then steps[i][j] is 3.

But the count array's index is the step when the explosion occurs. So for that cell, the mine would explode at step 3.

Yes.

So the steps are:

Initialize count array of len(s)+1 elements to zero.

Then:

for each cell (i,j):

   if (i,j) == (x0-1, y0-1):

       count[0] +=1

   else:

       if steps[i][j] is not infinity:

           count[steps[i][j]] +=1

       else:

           count[len(s)] +=1

But wait, the len(s) is the number of commands. So the maximum step is len(s), which is the last index of the count array.

Yes. For example, if the commands are length 3, then the count array is size 4 (indices 0,1,2,3). So len(s) is 3, which is the index of the last element.

So the algorithm is correct.

Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.

But simulating each step for 1e5 commands is O(1e5) time, which is acceptable. And the grid is 500x500, so for each step, we just check the new position and update steps if needed.

Now, code.

In Python, we can represent the steps as a 2D list. However, for x up to 500 and y up to 500, this is manageable.

First, read x, y, x0, y0.

Then read s.

Then, steps = [[inf for _ in range(y)] for _ in range(x)].

Set steps[x0-1][y0-1] = 0.

current_i = x0-1

current_j = y0-1

current_step = 1

for cmd in s:

   new_i = current_i

   new_j = current_j

   if cmd == 'L':

       if current_j > 0:

           new_j -=1

   elif cmd == 'R':

       if current_j < y-1:

           new_j +=1

   elif cmd == 'U':

       if current_i >0:

           new_i -=1

   elif cmd == 'D':

       if current_i < x-1:

           new_i +=1

   # else, no change

   # check if new position is visited for the first time

   if steps[new_i][new_j] == inf:

       steps[new_i][new_j] = current_step

   # update current position

   current_i, current_j = new_i, new_j

   current_step +=1

After this loop, steps array is filled with the earliest steps for each cell (except the starting cell, which is 0).

Then, count array is initialized to 0 for all len(s)+1 elements.

For the starting cell, count[0] +=1.

Then, for each cell (i,j):

   if i == x0-1 and j == y0-1:

       continue  # already counted

   else:

       if steps[i][j] != inf:

           count[steps[i][j]] +=1

       else:

           count[len(s)] +=1

So the total steps:

Total cells: x*y.

The starting cell contributes 1 to count[0].

Other (x*y -1) cells are processed.

But wait, in the initial steps array, (x0-1, y0-1) is 0, and other cells are inf except those visited during the command steps.

Wait no. The steps array is initialized to inf for all cells except (x0-1, y0-1). Then during the simulation, for each new position after each command, if steps[new_i][new_j] is inf, set it to current_step (which is 1-based). So steps array after simulation contains 0 (for the starting cell), and some steps for other cells, others are inf.

So for the cells that are not the starting cell, and steps[i][j] is inf, then the mine at (i,j) is not visited during any step (including 0). So the robot completes all commands and explodes, contributing to count[len(s)].

But wait, in the starting cell, the mine is placed once, contributing to count[0]. For other cells, the mine can be placed in any of the other x*y-1 cells, each once.

So in code:

count = [0] * (len(s) + 1)

count[0] = 1  # because the starting cell is (x0, y0), and it's a mine in one test.

for i in range(x):

   for j in range(y):

       if i == x0-1 and j == y0-1:

           continue

       if steps[i][j] == inf:

           count[-1] +=1

       else:

           count[steps[i][j]] +=1

But wait, no. Because the mine can be placed in any cell except the starting cell once. Wait, no. The problem states that exactly x*y tests are conducted. Each test places the mine in a unique cell. So each cell is used once. So for the starting cell, there's one test (the mine is there), contributing to count[0]. For all other cells, each is tested once. So the loop over all cells (i,j) must process each cell once. So the code should be:

count = [0] * (len(s) + 1)

# handle the starting cell (count[0] +=1)

count[0] = 1

# process all other cells

total_cells = x * y -1  # since starting cell is counted once

processed = 0

for i in range(x):

   for j in range(y):

       if i == x0-1 and j == y0-1:

           continue

       if steps[i][j] != inf:

           count[steps[i][j]] +=1

       else:

           count[len(s)] +=1

       processed +=1

       # but since it's x*y-1 cells, we can break once processed reaches x*y-1

       # but perhaps not needed.

But in code, we can loop through all cells, skip the starting cell, and process the others. For each such cell, add 1 to the appropriate count.

Yes.

So now, the code is manageable.

But let's test with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3 4 2 2

UURDRDRL

So x=3, y=4. starting cell (2,2) in 1-based is (1,1) in 0-based.

The command sequence is "UURDRDRL" → 8 commands.

Sample output is 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6 → which is 9 elements (0 to 8 steps).

So the code should process this.

The robot's path is:

Step 0: (1,1) → (2,2 in 1-based).

Then commands:

U → move up. Current i is 1. Moving up to 0.

So steps[0][1] is 1. So this cell is first visited here.

Next command U: try to move up again. i is 0, can't move up. So stays at (0,1). steps[0][1] is already 1.

So step 2: same position. So steps[0][1] is not updated.

Then R: move right. j is 1 → 2. steps[0][2] is set to 3.

Wait, let's simulate step by step.

Let's redo the path.

Sample Input 1:

x=3, y=4, x0=2, y0=2 → 0-based (1,1).

s = "UURDRDRL" → commands in order: U, U, R, D, R, D, R, L.

Simulate each step:

current_i, current_j = 1, 1. steps[1][1] =0.

current_step =1.

First command U: check if current_i >0. 1>0 → yes. new_i =0, new_j=1.

steps[0][1] is inf → set to 1.

current_i, j becomes 0,1. current_step is 2.

Second command U: new_i =0-1= -1? No. So can't move. So new_i remains 0.

steps[0][1] is already 1. So no change. current remains (0,1). current_step is 2.

Third command R: current_j=1. Can move to 2 (since y=4 → max j is 3 (0-based), 1 <3-1=3? Wait, y=4 → j can be 0,1,2,3. So current_j=1 can move to 2 (since 1 <4-1=3). So new_j=2.

steps[0][2] is inf → set to 3 (current_step is 3).

current becomes (0,2). current_step is 4.

Fourth command D: current_i=0 → can move down to 1.

new_i=1. steps[1][2] is inf → set to 4.

current becomes (1,2). current_step is5.

Fifth command R: current_j=2. can move to 3. new_j=3. steps[1][3] set to5.

current becomes (1,3). current_step=6.

Sixth command D: current_i=1 can move to 2. new_i=2. steps[2][3] set to6.

current becomes (2,3). current_step=7.

Seventh command R: current_j=3 → can't move. new_j remains 3. steps[2][3] is already 6. current_step=8.

Eighth command L: current_j=3 → move to 2. new_j=2. steps[2][2] set to8.

current becomes (2,2). current_step=9.

So after all commands, steps array has:

steps[0][1] =1.

steps[0][2] =3.

steps[1][2] =4.

steps[1][3] =5.

steps[2][3] =6.

steps[2][2] =8.

Also, the starting cell (1,1) is steps[1][1] =0.

Other cells may have steps set during the simulation.

So for each cell (i,j) not (1,1):

If steps[i][j] is set, then count[steps[i][j]] +=1.

Else, count[8] +=1.

The total cells are 3*4=12. So count[0] is 1 (the starting cell). The remaining 11 cells are processed.

Now, the steps for each cell:

- (0,0): inf → count[8] +=1.

- (0,1): 1 → count[1] +=1.

- (0,2):3 → count[3] +=1.

- (0,3):inf → count[8] +=1.

- (1,0):inf → count[8] +=1.

- (1,1): starting cell, skip.

- (1,2):4 → count[4] +=1.

- (1,3):5 → count[5] +=1.

- (2,0):inf → count[8] +=1.

- (2,1):inf → count[8] +=1.

- (2,2):8 → count[8] +=1.

Wait, no. (2,2) is steps[2][2] =8 (current_step was 8 when processing the 8th command). So steps[2][2] is 8. So cell (2,2) (0-based) is (3,3) in 1-based. So in the code, for this cell, steps[2][2] is 8. So the count[8] +=1.

Other cells:

(2,3): steps[2][3] =6 → count[6] +=1.

So let's count all non-starting cells:

Total non-starting cells: 12-1=11.

For each:

(0,0): count[8] → +1.

(0,1): count[1] → +1.

(0,2): count[3] →+1.

(0,3): count[8] →+1.

(1,0): count[8] →+1.

(1,2): count[4] →+1.

(1,3): count[5] →+1.

(2,0): count[8] →+1.

(2,1): count[8] →+1.

(2,2): count[8] →+1.

(2,3): count[6] →+1.

So:

count[0] =1.

count[1] +=1.

count[3] +=1.

count[4] +=1.

count[5] +=1.

count[6] +=1.

count[8] +=6 (from (0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)).

Wait, let's count:

Cells contributing to count[8] are:

(0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Wait no:

Wait, (2,2) is steps[2][2] =8. So for cell (2,2), steps[i][j] is 8. So count[8] +=1. But in the code, steps[2][2] is 8, which is not inf, so count[8] is incremented. Wait, no. Because steps[2][2] is 8, which is not inf, so count[8] +=1.

Wait, steps[2][2] is 8, so it's not inf. So in the code:

for cell (2,2) (which is not starting cell):

steps[i][j] is 8 → count[8] +=1.

Yes.

So the cells contributing to count[8] are:

(0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) → no, wait:

No, (2,2) is processed as steps[2][2] =8 → count[8] +=1.

So:

count[8] is incremented by:

(0,0) → yes.

(0,3) → yes.

(1,0) → yes.

(2,0) → yes.

(2,1) → yes.

(2,2) → no, steps[2][2] is 8 → count[8] +=1.

Wait, no. Because (2,2) is not the starting cell (the starting cell is (1,1)).

So (2,2) is a different cell. So steps[2][2] is 8 → count[8] +=1.

So total for count[8] is (0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) → 6 cells. But wait:

Looking at the cells:

(0,0) → steps is inf → count[8].

(0,3) → steps is inf → count[8].

(1,0) → steps is inf → count[8].

(2,0) → steps is inf → count[8].

(2,1) → steps is inf → count[8].

(2,2) → steps is 8 → count[8].

So (2,2) contributes to count[8], not to count[8]? Wait, no: steps[2][2] is 8, which is not inf. So count[8] is incremented. Because steps[i][j] is 8, so in the code, count[steps[i][j]] +=1 → count[8] +=1.

So for (2,2), steps[i][j] is 8, so count[8] +=1.

Then, the cells contributing to count[8] are:

(0,0) → 1.

(0,3) →1.

(1,0) →1.

(2,0) →1.

(2,1) →1.

(2,2) →1.

(2,3) → steps is 6 → count[6] +=1.

Wait, (2,3) is steps[i][j] =6 → count[6] +=1.

So the cells contributing to count[8] are (0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) → 6 cells. So count[8] has 6.

Other cells:

count[1] is 1 (0,1).

count[3] is 1 (0,2).

count[4] is 1 (1,2).

count[5] is 1 (1,3).

count[6] is 1 (2,3).

count[8] is 6 (from 6 cells).

But the sample output is 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6.

Wait, the sample output is for steps 0 to 8 (9 elements). So count[0] =1 (starting cell).

count[1] =1 (0,1).

count[3] =1 (0,2).

count[4] =1 (1,2).

count[5] =1 (1,3).

count[6] =1 (2,3).

count[8] =6 (six cells).

But the sample output shows:

1 (step 0), 1 (step 1), 0 (step 2), 1 (step3), 1 (step4), 1 (step5), 1 (step6), 0 (step7), 6 (step8).

So in the code, the steps for commands are 1-based. So step 1 is after first command, step 2 after second, etc. So the sample's steps are:

The code's count[steps[i][j]] is set to the command's step (1-based).

So for step 1 (command 1), step 2 (command 2), etc.

In the sample, steps 1,3,4,5,6,8 are the steps where other cells are first visited. So the code's count array should have 1 at positions 1,3,4,5,6,8, and 6 at 8.

But the sample's output is:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6.

Which has 1 at steps 0,1,3,4,5,6, and 6 at step8.

So the code's count array would be:

count[0] =1

count[1] =1 (0,1).

count[3] =1 (0,2).

count[4] =1 (1,2).

count[5] =1 (1,3).

count[6] =1 (2,3).

count[8] =6 (six cells).

Other counts (step 2,7) are zero.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code is correct.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But in Python, for big x and y, the steps array can be initialized as a list of lists. For x=500 and y=500, this is manageable.

Now, the code:

Read x, y, x0, y0.

Convert x0 and y0 to 0-based.

Read s.

Initialize steps array with inf, except steps[x0][y0] =0.

Simulate each command.

Then compute the count array.

Edge cases:

If x=1 and y=1. Then the starting cell is (0,0), and the mine can be placed here. So count[0] =1, and no other cells. So the output is 1 followed by len(s) zeros and then 0? Wait, len(s) is the number of commands. But if x*y is 1, then there's only one mine test, which is in the starting cell. So count[0] is 1, and all other counts (for steps 1 to len(s)) are zero. The output would have len(s)+1 elements. For example, if s is 'L' (len 1), the output is '1 0'.

But according to the code:

In x=1 and y=1:

steps is initialized with steps[0][0] =0.

Then, for each command in s:

the robot can't move (since it's in the corner). So new_i and new_j are the same. steps[0][0] is already 0. So steps remains 0 for (0,0), and all other cells are not present (since x=1, y=1). So when processing all cells:

count[0] =1 (starting cell).

Other cells: none. So the code's loops for i and j will not process any other cell. So count's other elements are 0.

So the output is 1 followed by len(s) zeros. Which is correct.

Another edge case: when the robot moves back to the starting cell in step t>0. For example, starting at (0,0), then moving away and back. But the mine is placed in the starting cell once (step 0). The other mines are in other cells. So steps for the starting cell is 0. If the robot returns to the starting cell in step 5, the steps array for (0,0) remains 0. So no impact.

So the code correctly handles this.

Now, code:

Read input:

x, y, x0, y0 = map(int, input().split())

x0 -=1

y0 -=1

s = input().strip()

Then steps = [[inf for _ in range(y)] for _ in range(x)].

But in Python, how to represent inf? We can use a large number, like 1e18.

But for code:

INF = float('inf')

steps = [ [INF] * y for _ in range(x) ]

steps[x0][y0] = 0

current_i, current_j = x0, y0

current_step =1

for cmd in s:

   new_i = current_i

   new_j = current_j

   if cmd == 'L':

       if current_j >0:

           new_j -=1

   elif cmd == 'R':

       if current_j < y-1:

           new_j +=1

   elif cmd == 'U':

       if current_i >0:

           new_i -=1

   elif cmd == 'D':

       if current_i < x-1:

           new_i +=1

   # check if new position is unvisited

   if steps[new_i][new_j] == INF:

       steps[new_i][new_j] = current_step

   # update current position

   current_i, current_j = new_i, new_j

   current_step +=1

Then compute the count array.

count = [0] * (len(s)+1)

count[0] =1  # starting cell

for i in range(x):

   for j in range(y):

       if i == x0 and j == y0:

           continue

       if steps[i][j] == INF:

           count[-1] +=1

       else:

           count[steps[i][j]] +=1

print(' '.join(map(str, count)))

This should work.

Testing the first sample:

After simulation, steps for (0,1) is 1.

steps for (0,2) is 3.

steps for (1,2) is4.

steps for (1,3) is5.

steps for (2,3) is6.

steps for (2,2) is8.

Other cells are INF.

So count[0] =1.

count[1] +=1 (0,1).

count[3] +=1 (0,2).

count[4] +=1 (1,2).

count[5] +=1 (1,3).

count[6] +=1 (2,3).

count[8] +=1 (2,2).

Other cells contribute to count[8] (the others are 6-1=5 cells? Wait, no. Let's see:

Total cells:3x4=12. Starting cell is 1. Other cells are 11.

In the code, count starts as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Then, for each non-starting cell:

- (0,0): INF → count[8] +=1.

- (0,1): steps 1 → count[1] +=1.

- (0,2):3 → count[3].

- (0,3):INF → count[8].

- (1,0):INF → count[8].

- (1,1): skipped.

- (1,2):4 → count[4].

- (1,3):5 → count[5].

- (2,0):INF → count[8].

- (2,1):INF → count[8].

- (2,2):8 → count[8].

- (2,3):6 → count[6].

So:

count[8] +=6 (0,0;0,3;1,0;2,0;2,1;2,2) → 6?

Yes. So count[8] is 6.

Other steps:

count[1] is 1.

count[3] is 1.

count[4] is1.

count[5] is1.

count[6] is1.

count[8] is6.

Other steps (0,2, etc.) are zero.

So the output is:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6 → which matches the sample.

So the code is correct.
