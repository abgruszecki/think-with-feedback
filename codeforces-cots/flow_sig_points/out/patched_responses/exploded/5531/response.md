Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimal time to destroy the enemy ship by using two lasers with certain power and reload times. Hmm. So, Monocarp can shoot either laser when it's charged, or wait to shoot both together for more damage. The goal is to find the minimal time possible such that the total damage is at least h.

First, let's understand the damage mechanics. Each shot (single or dual) reduces the enemy's durability by (P - s), where P is the sum of the lasers fired. So, if he shoots only laser 1, the damage is p1 - s. If both, then p1 + p2 - s. And each time you shoot, the lasers need to be recharged. But the reload times are t1 and t2 for each laser. So the charging happens over time.

The key here is to model all possible ways of shooting the lasers such that the cumulative damage reaches h as quickly as possible. Since the problem allows for multiple shots, and each shot can be either individual or both together, this feels like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming or some state-based BFS, but given the constraints, especially t1 and t2 up to 1e12, we need a more efficient approach.

Wait, let's look at the constraints. h is up to 5000. That's manageable. p1 and p2 are up to 5000 as well. So maybe we can model the damage and track the minimal time needed for each possible damage amount. But how?

Hmm. Let's think of the possible ways to accumulate damage. The main decisions are when to shoot one or both lasers. But the timing is crucial here because each shot resets the reload time for that laser. Alternatively, if we shoot a laser multiple times, the time between shots must be multiples of t1 or t2, respectively.

Wait, but the initial state is both lasers being zero charged. So the first time each laser can be fired is after their respective t_i times. So for laser 1, first shot can be at time t1, then next at t1*2, etc. Similarly for laser 2.

But when you fire both at the same time, that's a combined shot. For example, if laser 1 is ready at time a and laser 2 is ready at time b, and a is later than b, then you can wait until a to fire both. Then both start recharging again. But this might not always be optimal.

The problem is to find the sequence of shots (single or dual) that accumulates enough damage in the least time.

But how do we model all possible combinations efficiently?

Alternative approach: For each possible number of times we shoot each laser, compute the minimal time needed. But considering that some shots are done together. Hmm. Maybe the optimal solution involves shooting some combination of individual shots and combined shots.

Wait, perhaps the optimal time can be found by considering all possible numbers of dual shots and then filling in the remaining damage with individual shots. Because dual shots do more damage per time, perhaps using as many as possible is better, but not necessarily. Also, dual shots can be timed such that they are aligned at certain intervals.

Alternatively, think of all possible combinations where we have k dual shots. Then, for each k, compute how much time and damage that contributes, then see what's left and how to cover it with individual shots.

But even that might be tricky. Let's think: each dual shot requires that both lasers are charged. So the time between dual shots would be the maximum of t1 and t2, right? Because after a dual shot, both lasers start recharging. So the next dual shot can only happen after max(t1, t2) time. Wait, no. Wait, after a dual shot, each laser is at 0 charge and needs to charge for t1 or t2 time again. So the next time you can fire the dual shot is when both are charged again. So the time between consecutive dual shots is the maximum of t1 and t2. Because if t1 is larger than t2, then after each dual shot, laser 1 takes t1 time to charge again, so the next dual shot is at intervals of t1 (since laser 2 will be ready earlier, but you have to wait for laser 1). So the minimal possible time between dual shots is max(t1, t2).

So for k dual shots, the total time would be k * max(t1, t2). But wait, no. Because the first dual shot happens after the first time both are charged. Let's see: the initial state is both at 0. So the first time they are both charged is at time max(t1, t2). Because each laser starts charging from 0. So laser 1 is ready at t1, laser 2 at t2. So the earliest possible dual shot is at max(t1, t2). Then, after that, each dual shot takes max(t1, t2) more time. So for k dual shots, the time is k * max(t1, t2) + (k-1)*0? Wait, no. Wait, the first dual shot is at time max(t1, t2). Then, after that, each subsequent dual shot is at max(t1, t2) after the previous. So the time for k dual shots is k * max(t1, t2). Because each shot takes max(t1, t2) time. Wait, no. Let's see:

First dual shot at time m = max(t1, t2). Then, both lasers are discharged. Then, after another m time (since each laser takes their respective t_i time to recharge, but the next dual shot can happen at m again). So for k dual shots, total time is m * k. Because each shot occurs every m time.

Each dual shot contributes (p1 + p2 - s) damage. So k dual shots do k*(p1 + p2 - s) damage.

But maybe this is not the only way. Because between dual shots, you can fire individual shots. For example, after firing a dual shot, you might have some time before the next dual shot where one laser is ready earlier. So you can fire that laser again, which would reset its timer, but that might allow for more damage in a shorter time.

But this complicates things. So perhaps the optimal solution is a combination of some dual shots and some individual shots. But considering all possibilities could be time-consuming.

Alternative plan: precompute all possible times when dual shots can be made and individual shots, and track the minimal time for each possible damage. But how?

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled with dynamic programming, where the state is the current damage and the charge levels (or next available times) of each laser. But the problem is that the next available times can be very large (up to 1e12), making this approach infeasible.

Wait, but the damage is up to 5000, which is manageable. So perhaps we can model the minimal time to reach each damage value, and track the next possible times for each laser. But how?

Alternatively, for each possible time when a laser is fired, track the damage. But that's not feasible since the time can be up to 1e12.

Another approach: since the damage needed is up to 5000, and each shot contributes at least (p1 - s) or (p2 - s), which is at least 1 (since s < min(p1, p2)), the maximum number of shots needed is 5000. But even that, considering all possible combinations of shots, could be tricky.

Wait, but the damage per shot varies. For example, a dual shot does more damage than a single shot. So maybe using as many dual shots as possible is better. But sometimes it's better to do individual shots if the reload times are very long.

Alternatively, the minimal time could be the minimum between two possibilities: using only individual shots (for one or both lasers) or combining some dual shots with individual shots.

Wait, let's think of all possible scenarios:

1. Only use individual shots from laser 1. Time is (ceil(h/(p1 - s))) * t1. Similarly for laser 2.

2. Only use individual shots from both lasers. For example, alternate between them. But timing would be tricky. But perhaps this is not better than just using one.

3. Use a combination of dual shots and individual shots.

So the minimal time is the minimum between all possible combinations.

But how to model the combination?

Another idea: precompute all possible numbers of dual shots (k), and for each k, compute the minimal time needed to reach the required damage when using k dual shots. Then take the minimum over all possible k.

But how?

For each k, the damage from the dual shots is k*(p1 + p2 - s). The remaining damage is rem = h - k*(p1 + p2 - s). If rem <=0, then the time is k * max(t1, t2). Otherwise, we need to find the minimal time to deal the remaining damage using individual shots from either laser, after the k dual shots.

But how to model the individual shots after k dual shots?

Wait, after k dual shots, the time taken is k * max(t1, t2). But each dual shot resets both lasers. So after the last dual shot (the k-th), both lasers are discharged and start recharging. So their next available times are (k * m) + t1 and (k * m) + t2, where m = max(t1, t2).

Wait, no. Let's think step by step.

After the first dual shot at time m = max(t1, t2). Both lasers are discharged. Then, they start recharging. So after the first dual shot, the next time they can be fired (individually) is at time m + t1 for laser 1, and m + t2 for laser 2. But if we want to fire another dual shot, the next time would be m + m = 2m. But if after the first dual shot, we decide to fire individual shots, then the timing would be different.

So for each k, after the k-th dual shot at time k*m, the lasers are available again at k*m + t1 and k*m + t2. So any individual shots after the dual shots can be fired when their respective times are up.

So for a given k, the remaining damage is rem = max(0, h - k*(p1 + p2 - s)).

If rem <=0: then the total time is k * m.

Else: we need to cover rem damage with individual shots from either laser, which can be done by firing a certain number of shots from either or both lasers. The time for this would be the earliest time after k*m where the required shots can be made.

But how to compute that?

Let's say after the k dual shots (time k*m), the lasers can be used again at:

time_l1 = k*m + t1

time_l2 = k*m + t2

So, after that, each individual shot of laser 1 would take t1 time each. Similarly for laser 2.

But the initial time after the dual shots is the time when the lasers are next available. So, for example, if after k*m, we decide to fire laser 1 once, it would happen at time_l1, then again at time_l1 + t1, etc.

So the total damage from individual shots after k dual shots can be the sum of (p1 - s) per shot for laser 1 and (p2 - s) per shot for laser 2. We need to find the minimal time such that the sum of these shots is at least rem.

So for each k, the problem becomes: compute the minimal time to reach rem damage with individual shots, starting from time k*m, with the next available times for each laser as k*m + t1 and k*m + t2.

But how to compute this minimal time?

This seems like a subproblem that can be solved by considering all possible combinations of shots from each laser. But since rem is up to 5000, and the individual damage per shot is up to (5000-1) (since p can be up to 5000 and s is at least 1), the number of shots needed for rem is at most 5000 (since each shot does at least 1 damage).

So for a given rem, we can model the minimal time by considering how many shots to take from each laser. Let’s call them x and y, where x is the number of shots from laser 1 and y from laser 2. Then:

x*(p1 - s) + y*(p2 - s) >= rem

We need to find x and y >=0 such that the sum is >= rem, and the time taken is minimal.

The time taken for these x and y shots is the maximum between the time taken for x shots of laser 1 and y shots of laser 2, given their next available times.

For example, after k dual shots:

The first shot of laser 1 is at time_l1 = k*m + t1, the next is time_l1 + t1, etc. So x shots take time_l1 + (x-1)*t1.

Similarly for laser 2: y shots take time_l2 + (y-1)*t2.

The total time for the individual shots is the maximum of these two times. Because the individual shots can be scheduled in parallel. For example, if x=2 and y=3, the first shot of laser 1 is at time_l1, the next at time_l1 + t1. For laser 2: time_l2, time_l2 + t2, etc. The overall time is the maximum between the last shot of laser 1 and the last shot of laser 2.

So the total time for individual shots is max( time_l1 + (x-1)*t1, time_l2 + (y-1)*t2 )

But x and y must satisfy x*(p1-s) + y*(p2-s) >= rem.

So for each k, we need to find x and y >=0 such that x*(a) + y*(b) >= rem (where a = p1-s, b = p2-s), and then compute the time as k*m + max( t1*x_start, t2*y_start ), where x_start is the time taken for x shots (but I'm not sure here).

Wait, let's clarify:

After k dual shots, the next available times are:

time_l1 = k*m + t1 (since the dual shot was at k*m, and then t1 time to recharge)

time_l2 = k*m + t2.

So the first individual shot for laser 1 can be at time_l1. Each subsequent shot takes t1 time. So x shots take time_l1 + (x-1)*t1.

Similarly for laser 2: y shots take time_l2 + (y-1)*t2.

The time when all these shots are done is the maximum of these two values. So the total time after k dual shots is:

max( time_l1 + (x-1)*t1, time_l2 + (y-1)*t2 )

But x and y need to satisfy x*a + y*b >= rem.

Our goal is to find x and y that minimize this max value, given that x*a + y*b >= rem.

So for each k, the total time is:

time_dual = k * m

time_individual = max( time_l1 + (x-1)*t1, time_l2 + (y-1)*t2 )

total_time = time_dual + max( t1 * x, t2 * y )

Wait, no. Wait, time_l1 is already k*m + t1. So:

time_l1 + (x-1)*t1 = k*m + t1 + (x-1)*t1 = k*m + x * t1.

Similarly for the other: k*m + y * t2.

So the time for the individual shots is max( k*m + x * t1, k*m + y * t2 ) → k*m + max( x * t1, y * t2 )

Because k*m is a common term. So the total_time is:

k * m + max( x * t1, y * t2 )

But x and y must satisfy x*a + y*b >= rem.

So the problem reduces to, for each k (number of dual shots), compute the minimal possible max(x*t1, y*t2) such that x*a + y*b >= rem. Then, the total time is k*m + that minimal max.

So the minimal max(x*t1, y*t2) for x and y such that x*a + y*b >= rem.

We need to find x and y >=0 integers that minimize max(x*t1, y*t2) with x*a + y*b >= rem.

This is a key part of the problem. How to compute this minimal max efficiently for given a, b, rem, t1, t2.

Once we can compute this for each rem, then for each possible k (number of dual shots), compute rem = h - k*(p1+p2 -s). If rem <=0, then the time is k * m. Else, compute the minimal max(x*t1, y*t2) for x*a + y*b >= rem, add that to k*m, and find the overall minimum over all k.

So the steps are:

1. Iterate over all possible k (number of dual shots) from 0 to kmax where kmax is the maximum possible such that k*(p1+p2 -s) <= h. kmax can be up to h/(p1+p2 -s) → since h is up to 5000, and (p1+p2 -s) can be up to 5000+5000-1=9999, kmax can be up to 5000.

2. For each k, compute rem = h - k*(p1+p2 -s). If rem <=0, then candidate time is k*m. Else, compute the minimal time needed for the individual shots.

3. The minimal time for individual shots is the minimal max(x*t1, y*t2) such that x*(a) + y*(b) >= rem, where a = p1-s, b=p2-s.

So the question is, how to compute this minimal max(x*t1, y*t2) given a, b, rem, t1, t2.

This seems like a problem that can be approached with mathematical analysis. Let's see.

We need to find x and y >=0 such that a*x + b*y >= rem. We need to minimize max(t1*x, t2*y).

Let’s think of x and y as variables. We can model this as an optimization problem.

Assume that x and y can be real numbers (then find the minimal max, and then take the ceiling for x and y to get integers). But since x and y must be integers >=0, this complicates things. However, perhaps we can find the optimal x and y by iterating over possible x and y in a certain range.

But for a, b up to 5000, and rem up to 5000, perhaps a brute force approach is possible.

But even with a=1, rem=5000, x can be up to 5000, but then y would be 0. So for each x from 0 to ceil(rem/a), compute y = ceil( (rem - a*x) / b ), and then compute max(t1*x, t2*y). Then take the minimal such max.

But for rem up to 5000, and a up to 5000, x can range up to 5000, which is manageable. Similarly for y.

But for each x, we can compute the minimal y needed. So for each x in 0 ... x_max (where x_max is ceil(rem/a)), compute y = max(0, ceil( (rem - a*x) / b ) ), then compute max(t1*x, t2*y). Similarly, for each y in 0 ... y_max (ceil(rem/b)), compute x and do the same. Then take the minimal among all possibilities.

But doing this for each k (up to 5000) and for each x (up to 5000) per k would result in 5000 * 5000 * 5000 = 125e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each k, compute the minimal possible max(t1*x, t2*y) given a*x + b*y >= rem. To find this, perhaps we can find the optimal x and y by considering the ratio between t1 and t2 and the damage per unit time.

Alternatively, we can model this as a linear programming problem where we minimize the maximum of t1 x and t2 y, given a x + b y >= rem, x,y >=0. Then find the optimal real x and y, and check the nearby integer points.

But how?

Let’s model this for real variables.

We can set t1 x = t2 y. Because if one of them is larger, we can reduce the larger one to make them equal. So the minimal max is achieved when t1 x = t2 y. Because otherwise, say t1 x > t2 y. Then we can decrease x a bit and increase y, keeping a x + b y >= rem. This could result in a lower max.

So the optimal point is when t1 x = t2 y. Let's denote this as y = (t1 x) / t2.

Substituting into the damage equation:

a x + b * (t1 x / t2) >= rem → x (a + (b t1)/t2 ) >= rem → x >= rem / ( a + (b t1)/t2 )

So x >= rem * t2 / (a t2 + b t1 )

Similarly, y would be (t1 x)/t2.

But since x and y must be integers, we can compute x and y in real numbers, then take the ceiling and check nearby integers.

But this is a possible approach. Let's work through this.

Let’s find x_real = (rem * t2) / ( a t2 + b t1 )

y_real = (t1 x_real ) / t2 → ( rem * t1 t2 ) / ( a t2 + b t1 ) ) / t2 → rem * t1 / ( a t2 + b t1 )

So x_real and y_real are the real values where t1 x = t2 y and a x + b y = rem.

But since rem may not be exactly divisible by (a x + b y), we need to find x and y such that a x + b y >= rem, and t1 x and t2 y are as balanced as possible.

So the optimal real solution would be x = x_real, y = y_real, but since they are real, we need to check the integer points around them.

So possible steps:

1. Compute x_real and y_real as above.

2. Generate x candidates around x_real (floor, ceil, etc.), and compute y for each x, then check if a x + b y >= rem. For each valid (x, y), compute the max(t1 x, t2 y).

3. Similarly, generate y candidates around y_real and compute x for each.

4. Take the minimal max among all these candidates.

But since a x + b y must be >= rem, we need to ensure that. For example, for a given x, the minimal y is max(0, ceil( (rem - a x)/b )).

Alternatively, compute for x in [ x_floor - 1, x_floor, x_floor + 1, x_ceil -1, x_ceil, x_ceil +1 ] and similar for y. But perhaps even this would be manageable.

But how to handle the edge cases where a or b is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, s is less than min(p1, p2), so a and b are at least 1. So we don't need to worry about division by zero.

Let's see an example. Suppose rem=16, a=4 (p1-s=5-1=4?), t1=10, b=3 (p2-s=4-1=3?), t2=9.

Wait, in the first example, the input is:

p1=5, t1=10

p2=4, t2=9

h=16, s=1.

So a =5-1=4, b=4-1=3.

So for k=0, rem=16, need x*4 + y*3 >=16.

We can compute x_real = (16 *9)/(4*9 +3*10) → (144)/(36 +30) → 144/66 = 2.1818.

y_real = (10 *2.1818)/9 ≈ 2.4242.

So possible x candidates are 2, 3.

For x=2: y must be >= (16 -4*2)/3 → (16-8)/3=8/3≈2.666 → y=3.

So x=2, y=3: a*x +b*y= 8+9=17 >=16. max(2*10,3*9)= max(20,27)=27.

For x=3, y= ceil( (16-12)/3 )= ceil(4/3)=2. So y=2. a*x +b*y=12+6=18 >=16. max(30, 18)=30.

So the minimal max is 27. So total time would be 0*10 (since m=10) +27=27. But the example's solution uses two dual shots. So for k=2, rem=16-2*8=0. So time is 2*10=20. Which is better.

But this shows that for k=0, the individual shots would take 27, which is worse than the dual shots.

So the approach works.

So, for each k, compute the minimal max(t1 x, t2 y) for x and y that cover the required rem.

Now, the steps for the code:

1. Compute m = max(t1, t2). For each possible k (from 0 up to kmax where k*(p1+p2-s) <= h), compute rem = h -k*(p1+p2-s). If rem <=0: candidate is k*m. Else:

   a. Compute a = p1 -s, b=p2-s.

   b. Compute the minimal max(t1 x, t2 y) where x a + y b >= rem.

   c. The candidate time is k*m + max(t1 x, t2 y).

2. Find the minimal candidate across all k.

So, the key part is step 1.b. How to compute this efficiently.

The approach is to generate possible x and y around the optimal real solution.

So the code for step 1.b can be:

def compute_min_time(a, b, rem, t1, t2):

    min_time = infinity

    if rem <=0:

        return 0

    # Compute optimal x and y in real numbers.

    denominator = a * t2 + b * t1

    if denominator ==0:

        # a and b are 0? But according to constraints, a and b are >=1.

        # So this can't happen.

        pass

    x_real = (rem * t2) / denominator

    y_real = (rem * t1) / denominator

    # Generate possible x and y around x_real and y_real.

    # Check x from floor(x_real - 2) to ceil(x_real + 2), and same for y.

    for x_candidate in [math.floor(x_real)-1, math.floor(x_real), math.ceil(x_real), math.ceil(x_real)+1]:

        if x_candidate <0:

            continue

        # compute minimal y for this x.

        y_needed = max(0, (rem - a *x_candidate + b -1) // b )

        # compute y_needed as ceil( (rem -a x)/b )

        # but if rem -a x is <=0, y can be 0.

        if a *x_candidate >= rem:

            y_needed =0

        else:

            y_needed = (rem - a *x_candidate + b -1 ) // b

        current_time = max( x_candidate *t1, y_needed * t2 )

        if current_time < min_time:

            min_time = current_time

    # Now do the same for y candidates.

    for y_candidate in [math.floor(y_real)-1, math.floor(y_real), math.ceil(y_real), math.ceil(y_real)+1]:

        if y_candidate <0:

            continue

        x_needed = max(0, (rem - b * y_candidate +a -1 ) //a )

        if b * y_candidate >= rem:

            x_needed =0

        else:

            x_needed = (rem - b*y_candidate + a -1 ) //a

        current_time = max( x_needed *t1, y_candidate *t2 )

        if current_time < min_time:

            min_time = current_time

    # Also check cases where x=0 or y=0.

    # For x=0, compute y_needed = ceil(rem /b )

    y_needed = (rem +b -1 ) //b 

    current_time = max(0, y_needed * t2 )

    if current_time < min_time:

        min_time = current_time

    # For y=0, x_needed = ceil(rem /a )

    x_needed = (rem +a -1 ) //a 

    current_time = max( x_needed * t1, 0 )

    if current_time < min_time:

        min_time = current_time

    return min_time

But this code may miss some candidates, but perhaps by checking x and y around the real solution and also the extremes (x=0 or y=0), we can find the minimal time.

Alternatively, we can iterate x up to some upper limit, but for rem up to 5000 and a up to 5000, x can be up to 5000, which is manageable. But for each k, this would be O(5000) per k, leading to 5000 * 5000 = 25 million operations, which is acceptable for Python.

But wait, but 5000 is per k, and k can be up to 5000. So 5000 * 5000 = 25 million operations. Which should be manageable.

But perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each possible x in 0 ... ceil(rem/a), compute the required y and calculate the max(t1 x, t2 y). Then, take the minimal over all x. Similarly for y.

So the code would be:

min_time = infinity

for x in 0 to x_max:

    rem_x = max(0, rem - a *x)

    y = (rem_x + b -1 ) // b 

    current_time = max(x * t1, y * t2)

    if current_time < min_time:

        min_time = current_time

for y in 0 to y_max:

    rem_y = max(0, rem - b *y)

    x = (rem_y + a -1 ) //a 

    current_time = max(x * t1, y * t2)

    if current_time < min_time:

        min_time = current_time

But this would have O(x_max + y_max) steps. x_max is (rem +a -1 ) // a. For rem up to 5000 and a up to 5000, x_max can be up to 5000. Similarly for y_max. So total steps per k is 5000 + 5000 = 10,000 steps. For 5000 k's, this is 50 million steps. Which should be manageable.

But perhaps even this can be optimized.

Alternatively, iterate x from 0 to x_max, which is up to (rem // a) +1, and compute y for each x.

But let's proceed.

So, in code, for each k:

rem = h - k * (p1 + p2 - s)

if rem <=0:

   candidate_time = k * m

else:

   a = p1 -s

   b = p2 -s

   compute the minimal max(x*t1, y*t2) where x*a + y*b >= rem.

   candidate_time = k *m + minimal_max

then, take the minimal candidate_time over all k.

So, the code structure would be:

p1, t1 = map(int, input().split())

p2, t2 = map(int, input().split())

h, s = map(int, input().split())

a = p1 -s

b = p2 -s

m = max(t1, t2)

max_k = (h) // (p1 + p2 -s) + 2  # ensure we cover all possible k where k * (p1+p2 -s) could be <= h.

min_time = float('inf')

for k in range(0, max_k +1):

    total_dual_damage = k * (p1 + p2 -s)

    rem = h - total_dual_damage

    if rem <=0:

        candidate = k * m

        if candidate < min_time:

            min_time = candidate

        continue

    # Compute the minimal time for individual shots.

    # Now compute x and y such that a x + b y >= rem.

    # Method: iterate x from 0 to x_max, compute y needed.

    # Also iterate y from 0 to y_max, compute x needed.

    current_min = float('inf')

    # Iterate x:

    x_max = (rem + a -1) //a 

    for x in range(0, x_max +1):

        damage_x = a * x

        rem_y = rem - damage_x

        if rem_y <=0:

            y =0

        else:

            y = (rem_y + b -1) //b 

        time_x = x * t1

        time_y = y * t2

        current_time = max(time_x, time_y)

        if current_time < current_min:

            current_min = current_time

    # Iterate y:

    y_max = (rem + b -1) //b 

    for y in range(0, y_max +1):

        damage_y = b * y

        rem_x = rem - damage_y

        if rem_x <=0:

            x =0

        else:

            x = (rem_x + a -1) //a 

        time_x = x * t1

        time_y = y * t2

        current_time = max(time_x, time_y)

        if current_time < current_min:

            current_min = current_time

    # Also check the cases where x and y are derived from the real optimal.

    # Maybe not necessary, but perhaps adds a few candidates.

    # But since we are iterating x and y up to x_max and y_max, perhaps the code above is sufficient.

    candidate = k * m + current_min

    if candidate < min_time:

        min_time = candidate

print(min_time)

But this code may not handle some edge cases. For example, when one of a or b is very large, and the other is small, but the t_i's are such that it's better to shoot the other laser.

But considering that the code iterates all possible x and y up to the maximum required, this should find the minimal time.

For k=1:

total_dual_damage=8. rem=8.

So compute x and y for rem=8.

x_max=8//4 +1=2+1=3.

So x ranges from 0 to 3:

x=0: y=(8 +3-1)/3=10/3=3.333 → y=4. Time is max(0,4*9)=36.

x=1: damage_x=4 → rem_y=4. y= (4+3-1)/3 =6/3=2 → y=2. time_x=10*1=10. time_y=9*2=18. max=18. current_min is 18.

x=2: damage_x=8 → y=0. time_x=20. max(20,0) →20. current_min is 18.

x=3: damage_x=12 → y=0. time_x=30. max=30.

Then iterate y:

y_max = (8 +3-1)/3= (10)/3=3.333 →4.

y ranges 0-4.

y=0: x=2 (8/4=2). time_x=2*10=20. → max(20,0)=20.

y=1: damage_y=3 → rem_x=5. x= (5 +4-1)/4=8/4=2. time_x=20. time_y=9. max is 20.

y=2: damage 6 → rem_x=2. x=1. time_x=10. max(10, 18) →18.

y=3: damage 9 → rem_x=-1. x=0. time_y=27. max(0,27)=27.

y=4: damage 12 → x=0. time_y=36. max 36.

So the current_min is 18.

So candidate is k=1: 10 +18=28. Which is higher than 20.

So the code would find 20 as the minimal.

Second example:

Input:

10 1

5000 100000

25 9

So a=10-9=1, b=5000-9=4991.

h=25.

m= max(1, 100000) =1e5.

k can be from 0 to 25/(10+5000 -9) →25/(5001) →0.

So only k=0.

rem=25.

So compute x and y:

x_max =25 /1 +1=25+1=26.

Iterate x from 0 to 26.

x=25: y= (25 -25*1)/4991 →0. So y=0. time_x=25*1=25. time_y=0. max=25.

Which is the correct answer.

Thus, the code would return 0*1e5 +25=25.

So the code works for the examples.

Another test case: when using a combination of dual shots and individual shots.

But the code seems to cover all possibilities.

Now, the code's complexity is O(max_k * (x_max + y_max)).

max_k can be up to (h) // (p1+p2 -s) + 2. For h up to 5000, and p1+p2 up to 1e4, max_k can be up to 5000/ (2) +2 →2500+2=2502.

x_max for each k is up to (rem + a-1)//a. For rem up to 5000 and a up to 5000, x_max can be up to 5000.

Same for y_max.

But for each k, the x and y iterations are O( (rem/a) + (rem/b) ), which for a=1 and rem=5000 is 5000 steps. But in that case, the y part would have rem/b steps, which for b=5000 would be 1.

But overall, the code's time complexity is O(5000 * (5000 + 5000)) →50 million operations. Which should be manageable in Python within 4 seconds. But perhaps we can optimize further.

But given the problem constraints, this approach should work.

Thus, the code should work correctly.
