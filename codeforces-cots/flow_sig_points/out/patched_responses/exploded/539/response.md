<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find how many numbers n have exactly m trailing zeros in their factorial. And then list them all in order. Hmm.

First, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros in n! is the sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.

So, the main challenge here is to find all n such that the count of trailing zeros in n! is exactly m. Then we need to output how many such n exist and list them.

Wait, but how do we find these n values efficiently? Let's think. For a given m, the possible n's could be a range of consecutive numbers. Because when you increase n by 1, the trailing zero count increases only when n is a multiple of 5. Wait, not exactly. For example, 24! has 4 trailing zeros, 25! has 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. Hmm, right. So the trailing zero count can jump by more than 1. Therefore, there might be some m values for which there are no n's. Like in the second example where m=5 gives output 0.

So, the approach is: for the given m, find the range of n's where the trailing zeros count is exactly m. But how?

I think the way to do this is to find the lower and upper bounds where the trailing zeros equal m. Since the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing, once we find the first n where the count is m and the last n where the count is m, the numbers in between (inclusive) that have exactly m zeros form a consecutive sequence. Wait, but is that the case? Because if the trailing zero count increases by more than 1 at some point, there could be gaps. For example, between n=24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6, so m=5 would have no n's. So the key is to find the minimal n where the count is m, then find the next n where the count is m+1. Then check if all numbers between these two have exactly m zeros. Wait no. Because the trailing zero count could have steps larger than 1. So, for example, m=5, there's no n where the count is 5. So in that case, the answer is 0.

So the steps needed are:

1. Find the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if trailing_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then the answer is 0.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Let's say we want to find all n where trailing_zeros(n) is m. Let's use binary search to find the first n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Then find the first n where trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1. The difference between these two would give the range of n's where trailing_zeros(n) is exactly m. But only if the first n's trailing_zeros is exactly m. Otherwise, there's no solution.

Wait, let's see. For example, in the first test case, m=1. Let's find the first n where trailing_zeros(n) >=1. That would be 5. Then the first n where trailing_zeros(n) >=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (since 10 is excluded) have trailing zeros 1. So the count is 5-10-1? Wait, 5 to 9 inclusive is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Which matches the first example. So the approach would be:

- Find the lower bound using binary search (the minimal n with trailing_zeros >=m)
- Find the upper bound (the minimal n with trailing_zeros >=m+1)
- Then, if the trailing_zeros(lower_bound) is exactly m, then the answer is upper_bound - lower_bound. Otherwise, zero.

But wait, how do we check if there's any n in [lower_bound, upper_bound -1] that has exactly m trailing zeros? Because in some cases, even if the lower bound's trailing zeros is m, but upper_bound's is m+1, but in between, there's a jump. Like for m=4. The lower bound would be 20. The upper bound for m+1=5 is 25. So numbers 20-24 have trailing zeros of 4+1 (20/5=4, 20/25=0.8, so sum is 4. Wait, 20! has 4 trailing zeros. 24! is 24/5=4, 24/25=0, sum 4. 25! is 25/5=5, 25/25=1, sum 6. So for m=5, there are no numbers. So between 20 and 25 (exclusive), the trailing zeros are 4, then jumps to 6. So for m=5, the lower bound would be 25 (since trailing_zeros(25) is 6 >=5?), but wait no. Wait for m=5, the trailing_zeros(n) for n=25 is 6. So the lower bound would be the minimal n where trailing_zeros(n)>=5. Let's compute trailing_zeros(n) for 20: 4. 21:4. 22:4. 23:4. 24:4. 25:6. So the minimal n where trailing_zeros >=5 is 25. Then the upper bound for m+1=6 is the minimal n where trailing_zeros >=6. For n=25, trailing_zeros is 6. So upper bound would be 25. So the numbers in between lower (25) and upper (25) would be 0. So the count is zero. So the approach works.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n: count_zeros(n).

2. Find the smallest n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) >= m.

3. Find the smallest n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) >= m+1.

4. Check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then there are no numbers (output 0). Otherwise, the answer is (n_high - n_low), and the numbers are n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.

So, for example, when m=1:

n_low is 5 (count_zeros(5) =1), which is exactly m. n_high is 10 (count_zeros(10) =2). So the numbers are 5-9 inclusive, which is 5 numbers.

For m=5:

n_low is 25 (count_zeros(25) =6), which is higher than m. So there's no solution. So output 0.

So the key is to perform two binary searches: one for m and another for m+1. Then check if the count_zeros(n_low) equals m. If yes, the answer is the range from n_low to n_high-1.

Now, how to implement the count_zeros function efficiently.

The function count_zeros(n) computes the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division becomes zero. So for n=25, 25//5=5, 25//25=1, sum is 6. That's correct.

Implementing this is straightforward.

Then, for binary search, we need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. The maximum possible n can be up to 5*m. Because each 5 contributes at least one zero. So the maximum n can't be more than 5*m, since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one. Wait, for example, m=5. Then 5*5=25, but 25's count is 6. Hmm. So maybe 5*m is not enough, but perhaps 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search. Wait, let's think. For m=1, 5*1=5 is correct. For m=6, which is the count for 25, 5*6=30. Let's see count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6, 30//25=1, 6+1=7. So 30's count is 7. So perhaps 5*m can be a starting upper bound, but sometimes we need higher. Alternatively, perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m, but when m is up to 1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.

Wait, but when m=1e5, what is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1e5? Let's compute. Let's see, the count_zeros(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... which is approximately n/4. So for m=1e5, n is around 4e5. So 5*m would be 5e5, which is higher. So using 5e5 as upper bound for binary search is acceptable. So in the binary search for n_low, the high can be set to 5*m. Similarly for n_high, the high can be 5*(m+1). Or perhaps even higher, but 5e5 is manageable.

But perhaps for larger m, 5*m might not be sufficient. For example, m=1e5, the actual minimal n could be 400,000 (assuming count_zeros(400,000) is 400,000/5 = 80,000; 80,000 /5 = 16,000; 16,000 /5=3,200; 3,200/5=640; 640/5=128; 128/5=25.6 → sum is 80,000 +16,000=96,000 +3,200=99,200 +640=99,840 +128=99, 968 +25=99,993. Hmm, that's not enough. Wait, I'm trying to compute for n=5e5. Let's see:

n=5e5.

count_zeros(5e5) = 5e5//5 +5e5//25 +5e5//125 +5e5//625 + ... 

Each term is 1e5, 2e4, 4e3, 8e2, 160, 32, 6, 1. Summing all gives 1e5 + 2e4 = 120,000 +4e3 =124,000 +8e2=124,800 +160=124,960 +32=124,992 +6=124,998 +1=124,999. So 5e5 gives 124,999 zeros. So for m=1e5, the minimal n would be lower than 5e5.

Wait, but 5e5 is 500,000, which gives 124,999 zeros. So for m=1e5 (100,000), the minimal n would be somewhere around 400,000. Because 400,000//5 is 80,000. 400,000//25 is 16,000. 400,000//125 is 3,200. 400,000//625=640. 400,000//3125=128. 400,000//15625=25.6 → 25. 400,000//78125=5.12 →5. 400,000//390625=1. So sum is 80k+16k=96k +3.2k=99.2k +640=99,840 +128=99,968 +25=99,993 +5=99,998 +1=99,999. So 400,000 gives 99,999 zeros. Which is one short of 1e5. So the next step would be 400,000 +5 =400,005. Let's compute count_zeros(400,005):

Each step as before, but 400,005//5=80,001. Then 400,005//25=16,000 (since 400,005 /25=16,000.2). So 16,000. Then 400,005//125=3200.04 →3200. And so on. So the sum would be 80,001 +16,000 +3,200 +640 +128 +25 +5 +1 = 80,001 +16k =96,001 +3,200=99,201 +640=99,841 +128=99,969 +25=99,994 +5=99,999 +1=100,000. So for 400,005, the count is exactly 1e5. So n_low is 400,005. Then n_high is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=1e5+1=1e5+1. Which would be 400,010? Let's see. Let's compute count_zeros(400,010):

400,010//5=80,002. 400,010//25=16,000.4 →16,000. Then the same as before. So 80,002 +16,000=96,002 +3,200=99,202 +640=99,842 +128=99,970 +25=99,995 +5=100,000 +1=100,001. So count_zeros(400,010) is 100,001. So n_high would be 400,005, since the count for 400,005 is 1e5, and for 400,010 it's 1e5+1. Wait no. Wait, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, in this case m+1 is 1e5+1. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=1e5+1 is 400,005, because 400,005 gives exactly 1e5. Then for m+1, we need to find n where count_zeros(n)>=1e5+1. So maybe 400,005's count is 1e5, so the next possible is 400,006. Let's check for 400,006. The count would be:

400,006//5 = 80,001.2 →80,001. Then 400,006//25 is 16,000.24 →16,000. So same as 400,005. So the count would still be 1e5. So the next possible n where count increases is when you hit a multiple of 5. So 400,005 is a multiple of 5 (since it's 5*80,001). Adding 1, 2,3,4 won't change the division by 5, 25, etc. So the next step where count_zeros increases is 400,010 (the next multiple of 5). So in that case, the count_zeros(n_high) would be 80,002 (from 400,010//5=80,002), and sum would be 80,002+16,000 (from 400,010//25=16,000) + ... which gives the same as before: 100,001.

So for m=1e5, the n_low is 400,005, and n_high is 400,010. Then the answer is 400,010 -400,005 =5. So the numbers would be 400,005,400,006,400,007,400,008,400,009. Because all of these numbers have count_zeros equal to 1e5. Wait, but how? Because those numbers are 400,005, which is 5 * ... so the count is 1e5. The next numbers, 400,006, 400,007, etc. up to 400,009. The count_zeros for those would still be 1e5. Because the next multiple of 5 is 400,010. So between 400,005 and 400,010, all numbers have the same count_zeros. So the answer would be 5 numbers.

But how? Let me see. Let's take n=400,005: count is 1e5. Then n=400,006: when you compute count_zeros, it's 400,006//5=80,001 (since 400,005 is 5*80001, so 400,006 divided by 5 is 80001.2, floor is 80001). Then 400,006//25 is 16,000 (400,006 divided by 25 is 16000.24). Similarly, all higher terms would be the same as for 400,005. So count_zeros(400,006) is 80001 +16,000 +3,200 +640 +128 +25 +5 +1 = let's compute:

80,001 +16,000 =96,001

+3,200 =99,201

+640=99,841

+128=99,969

+25=99,994

+5=99,999 

+1=100,000.

Wait, but earlier calculation for 400,005 gave sum of 100,000. So how come 400,006 gives the same sum? Because 400,005 is 5*80001, so count_zeros is 80001 (from 5) + 80001//5=16,000 (from 25) + 16,000//5=3,200 (from 125) + etc. Wait, wait, the count_zeros function is the sum of n divided by 5, 25, 125, etc. So for n=400,006, the divisions by 5,25, etc. would be as follows:

5: 400,006 //5 = 80,001 (since 5*80,001 =400,005, so 400,006//5 is 80,001).

25: 400,006 //25 =16,000 (25*16,000=400,000, so 400,000/25=16,000, 400,006-400,000=6, which gives 16,000 + 6/25=0.24, so floor is 16,000.

125: 400,006 //125= 3,200 (since 125*3,200=400,000. 400,006-400,000=6, 6//125=0. So 3,200).

625: 400,006//625=640.0096... →640.

3125: 400,006//3125=128.002 →128.

15625: 400,006//15625=25.6 →25.

78125: 400,006//78125=5.12 →5.

390625: 400,006//390625=1.024 →1.

So sum is 80,001 +16,000=96,001 +3,200=99,201 +640=99,841 +128=99,969 +25=99,994 +5=99,999 +1=100,000. So yes, 400,006's count is 1e5. So all numbers from 400,005 up to 400,009 (the next multiple of 5 minus 1) will have the same count of trailing zeros. So the answer is 5 numbers: 400,005,400,006,400,007,400,008,400,009.

So the approach works.

So now, the steps to implement this are:

1. Implement the count_zeros function.

2. Binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Call this n_low.

3. Binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this n_high.

4. Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0. Else, the answer is (n_high - n_low), and the numbers are n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.

Now, the binary search for n_low and n_high.

For the binary search, the initial low can be 0 (since n has to be positive), and high can be 5e14 or some large number. Wait, but m can be up to 1e5. For m=1e5, the minimal n is around 4e5. So setting high to 1e18 is safe but may take more steps. But binary search is logarithmic, so even high=1e18 is manageable.

Wait, but for binary search steps, the maximum number of steps would be around 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). So it's acceptable.

So the code steps:

Read m.

Compute n_low via binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m.

Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.

Else, compute n_high via binary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=m+1.

The answer's count is n_high -n_low. The numbers are n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1.

Now, code.

Implement count_zeros as a function:

def count_zeros(n):
    res = 0
    while n >0:
        n = n//5
        res +=n
    return res

Then, binary search for the lower bound.

Function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=target.

def find_min(target):
    low = 0
    high = 5 * target  # arbitrary upper bound, but maybe not enough. Maybe better to use higher.
    # but in practice, binary search with high as 5*target may not be sufficient. For example, when target is 1e5, 5e5 is 500,000, but the actual n_low is 400,005, which is 5*80001. So 5*target is 5e5, which is higher than 4e5, so it's safe. Wait, 5*target here is 5*1e5=5e5. So the high is 5e5, which is larger than 4e5. So the binary search will find the correct value.

    # but maybe in some cases, 5*target is not sufficient. Let's think for target=1e5. So high is 5e5. The binary search would check mid values. Let's see.

    # So perhaps using 5e18 as the upper bound.

    high = 5 * 10**18  # A very large number to cover all cases.

    answer = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) //2
        cz = count_zeros(mid)
        if cz >= target:
            answer = mid
            high = mid -1
        else:
            low = mid +1
    return answer

Wait, but the initial answer is 0. So for example, if target is 0, but since m starts from 1, perhaps this is not an issue.

But in the code, when m is given, target is m or m+1.

So, for m=1, target is 1. The binary search will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=1, which is 5.

Once n_low is found, check if count_zeros(n_low) ==m.

If yes, then compute n_high.

Then the answer is n_high -n_low.

But wait, let's see. For example, in the first sample:

n_low is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1 == m=1. So proceed.

n_high is find_min(m+1=2). The minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2 is 10. So 10-5=5. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.

Another example: m=5. Then find_min(5) would be 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6 >=5). Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No. So output 0.

So the code would output 0.

So the code logic is correct.

Now, putting it all together.

Read m.

Compute n_low = find_min(m).

If count_zeros(n_low) !=m → output 0.

Else, compute n_high = find_min(m+1).

Then the answer is n_high -n_low, and the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.

But how to handle when m=0? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need.

Now, code.

But for the binary search, when target is m=1e5, the high is 5e18, which is manageable. Because each step of binary search is O(1) for count_zeros. How efficient is count_zeros? For n up to 1e18, the loop runs log5(n) times. For 1e18, log5(1e18) is around log(1e18)/log(5) → 18*log(10)/log(5). Log10(5) is about 0.7. So 18 /0.7 ≈25.7. So about 26 steps per count_zeros. Binary search takes about 60 steps. So per binary search, 26*60=1560 steps. And there are two binary searches. So total steps are manageable even for Python. So the code should run within 2 seconds.

So the code is feasible.

Now, coding in Python.

But note that in Python, for large numbers, integer division is manageable.

Now, the code:

Read m from input.

Compute n_low = find_min(m). Check if count_zeros(n_low) ==m. If not, output 0.

Else, compute n_high = find_min(m+1). The numbers are from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.

But for m=1e5, this could be a large range. But according to the problem statement, we need to output all the numbers. However, when m is up to 1e5, the answer could have up to 5 numbers (like in the example where m=1e5, there are 5 numbers). So the maximum possible k is 5. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible k is how many numbers have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m=3, then find_min(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). n_high is find_min(4) which is 20. So the numbers are 15-19 →5 numbers. So for any m that is possible, the answer can be up to 5 numbers. Because the trailing zeros can increase by more than 1 only when n is a multiple of 5's higher powers. For example, when n increases from 24 to 25, the count jumps by 2. So between two consecutive multiples of 5, the count can only increase by 1. So for example, between 5k and 5k+5, the count increases by 1. So for numbers between 5k and 5k+5-1, the count is the same. So when the minimal n_low is 5k, then the numbers 5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4 will all have the same count. So the answer is 5 numbers. But if n_high is 5k+5, then the answer is 5 numbers.

But wait, in some cases, the count could jump by more than 1. For example, n=25 (count_zeros is 6), then next number is 26, which adds 0. So the count for 25 is 6, 26 is 6, etc. So when m=6, the answer would be 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers. But if m=5, there's no such numbers.

So the maximum possible k is 5. So in code, for all valid cases, the output will be a list of 5 numbers. Wait, but what about when m=6, the answer would be 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers.

But wait, what about when the count increases by more than 1 in some cases? Like for m=24. Let's compute n_low and n_high.

Wait, count_zeros(24) is 4. 25's count is 6. So for m=5, there's no n. For m=6, n_low is 25. n_high would be 30 (count_zeros(30) is 7). So 25-29: 5 numbers. So output is 5 numbers.

So the maximum possible k is 5. So when the answer exists, the output will have up to 5 numbers. So the code can generate the list from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers.

So the code can output those numbers as a space-separated list.

So, putting it all together.

Now, code.

But in Python, for numbers up to 1e18, the code handles them as integers.

Now, the code:

def count_zeros(n):
    res = 0
    while n >0:
        n = n //5
        res +=n
    return res

Testing this code with the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

1 → output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.

n_low = find_min(1). Let's compute:

binary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=1.

The low starts at 0, high at 5e18. The mid steps.

But for n=5, count_zeros is 1. So the minimal is 5.

Check count_zeros(5) is 1 → yes.

n_high = find_min(2). Which is 10. So 10-5=5. The numbers are 5-9.

Sample input 2: 5 → output 0.

n_low = find_min(5). Let's compute:

Looking for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5.

The minimal n is 25. Because count_zeros(20)=4, 24 is 4. 25 gives 6. So n_low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.

Thus, code works for samples.

Another test case: m=6.

n_low is 25. count_zeros(25)=6 → yes.

n_high is find_min(7). What's the first n where count_zeros(n)>=7?

count_zeros(25) is 6. 25,26,27,28,29 all have 6. 30 gives count_zeros(7). So n_high is 30. So 30-25=5 → output 5 25 26 27 28 29.

Thus, code works.

Another test case: m=100000. The code should find the correct n_low and n_high.

Thus, the code should be correct.
