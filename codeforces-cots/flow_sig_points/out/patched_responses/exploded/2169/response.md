Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.

The problem is about determining the maximum length of a consecutive integer sequence starting from m, where each term added to the sequence costs S(n)*k, and the total cost cannot exceed w. S(n) is the number of digits in n. So, for each number n in the sequence, the cost is the digit count multiplied by k. We need to find the maximum number of elements we can have starting from m such that the sum of their costs is <= w.

Hmm. Let's see the examples.

First example: w=9, m=1, k=1. The numbers are 1,2,...9. Each has S(n)=1. So 9 elements, sum is 9*1=9. So output 9. That makes sense.

Second example: 77 7 7. So each number's cost is digits *7. Let's see. The starting number is 7. Let's see how many numbers can be added.

Let's compute each term:

7 has 1 digit. Cost per term is 1*7=7. Let's see how many such terms we can take. The sum is 7 * x <=77. x can be 11, but maybe when numbers change their digits.

Wait, but m starts at 7. So the numbers are 7,8,9,10,11,... Wait, when m is 7, the next numbers are 8,9, then 10. So S(7)=1, S(8)=1, S(9)=1, S(10)=2, etc.

The cost for each number:

7:7*7=7?

Wait, the cost for n is S(n)*k. So in this example, k=7. So each cost is S(n)*7.

So for the first three numbers (7,8,9), each contributes 1*7=7. So three terms would cost 3*7=21. Then 10 is next, contributing 2*7=14. Let's see the total allowed is 77. Let's track:

Let's compute how many numbers can be added until the sum exceeds 77.

Let's think: the initial numbers are in ranges where the digits are the same. For example, 1-digit numbers (7-9), 2-digit (10-99), 3-digit (100-999), etc. For each such range, compute how many numbers we can take from that range given the remaining budget.

The approach would be:

1. Find the digit lengths of the numbers starting from m, and group consecutive numbers with the same digit length.

2. For each group, calculate how many numbers can be taken from it given the remaining budget.

3. Subtract the cost from the budget and add the count to the answer.

But how to model this efficiently, especially considering that m and w can be up to 1e16, which is a huge number. We need an algorithm that doesn't iterate each number but computes in chunks based on digit lengths.

Let me outline the steps:

Initialize current number as m. The remaining budget is w. The count is 0.

While the remaining budget >0 and current number can be added with its cost:

- Determine the digit length d of the current number.

- Find the next number where the digit length increases. That is, the next number after the current group is 10^d. For example, if current number is 7 (d=1), the next group starts at 10 (d=2). So the numbers from 7 to 9 are in the d=1 group. The next group starts at 10.

- So the maximum number in the current group is (10^d -1). For example, d=2: 10 to 99.

- So for the current group, the start is current m. The end is min(next_start -1, current m + max_possible). But the next start is 10^d. So the numbers from m to 10^d -1 are all d digits.

But wait, what if the current number is 100 (d=3), then next start is 1000 (d=4). So the group is 100-999.

So for each current m, first determine the current digit length d. Then compute the next_start as 10^d. The end of this group is next_start -1.

So the numbers in this group are from current m to next_start-1. The count in this group is next_start - current m.

But wait, the next_start could be larger than the maximum possible when considering the budget. So in each group, we can take as many numbers as possible, limited by either the group's end or the budget.

So for each group:

- Compute the maximum possible numbers in this group: numbers_in_group = next_start - m.

- Compute the cost per number: d * k.

- The total cost for taking all numbers_in_group would be numbers_in_group * d * k.

- If the remaining budget is >= this total cost, then take all numbers in the group. Add numbers_in_group to the count. Subtract the total cost from the budget. Then set m to next_start.

- Else, compute how many numbers can be taken from this group with the remaining budget. That is, possible = remaining_budget // (d * k). Add possible to count. Subtract possible * d *k from the budget. Then break, since there's no more budget.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize count =0

current = m

remaining = w

loop:

d = number of digits in current (S(current))

next_start = 10^d

max_in_group = next_start - current

cost_per = d * k

total_cost = max_in_group * cost_per

if total_cost <= remaining:

    count += max_in_group

    remaining -= total_cost

    current = next_start

else:

    possible = remaining // cost_per

    if possible ==0:

        break

    count += possible

    remaining -= possible * cost_per

    break

repeat until remaining <=0 or current exceeds possible.

Wait, but how to compute the number of digits in current? For example, for m=1, d=1. For m=9, d=1. For m=10, d=2.

So the number of digits can be found by converting the number to a string and getting its length. But for large m (up to 1e16), converting to a string each time is O(1) for practical purposes. Alternatively, compute it via logarithms. But in Python, for very large numbers, even converting to a string is manageable.

Alternatively, compute the digits via log10:

d = len(str(current)) 

But for m up to 1e16, str conversion is trivial.

But in code, for each current, compute d as the number of digits. Then next_start is 10^d. For example, if current is 123, then d=3, next_start=1000.

But 10^d can be computed as 10 ** len(str(current)).

Wait, but for current=999, len(str(current))=3, 10**3=1000. So yes.

So code steps:

Read w, m, k.

count =0

current = m

remaining = w

while True:

    d = len(str(current))  # digits in current

    next_start = 10 ** d

    max_numbers = next_start - current

    cost_per = d * k

    # compute how much can be taken from this group

    if cost_per > remaining:

        # even one number is not possible

        break

    # maximum possible numbers is max_numbers, but need to check cost

    total_cost = max_numbers * cost_per

    if total_cost <= remaining:

        count += max_numbers

        remaining -= total_cost

        current = next_start

    else:

        possible = remaining // cost_per

        count += possible

        remaining -= possible * cost_per

        break

    # check if remaining is zero after subtraction

    if remaining <=0:

        break

return count

Wait, but what if after processing a group, the remaining is zero but current is next_start. Then the loop would continue. But after processing the group, current is set to next_start. But if there's no remaining, the next iteration would check if cost_per (for next group) is possible. So, in code, after processing a group, check remaining again.

But let's see with the first example:

w=9, m=1, k=1.

current=1, d=1.

next_start=10.

max_numbers=9 (10-1=9). cost_per=1*1=1. total_cost=9*1=9. remaining is 9. So 9 <=9: yes. count +=9, remaining=0. current becomes 10. Then loop checks again: remaining is 0. Break. So total count is 9. Correct.

Another example: input 77 7 7.

current=7. d=1. next_start=10. max_numbers=3 (7,8,9). cost_per=1*7=7. total_cost=3*7=21. remaining=77. 21 <=77: yes. count +=3, remaining=77-21=56. current=10.

Now, current=10. d=2. next_start=100. max_numbers=90 (100-10=90). cost_per=2*7=14. total_cost=90*14=1260. remaining 56. 1260>56. So possible =56//14=4. count +=4, remaining 56-4*14=0. So total count is 3+4=7. Which matches the sample.

Another example: input 1 1 2. The cost per number (digits*2). m=1. d=1. cost_per=2. The remaining is 1. 1 <2, so can't take any. Output 0.

So this algorithm works for the samples.

Now, the problem is to implement this correctly, handling large numbers.

But wait, how to compute next_start? For example, for current=1000, len(str(current)) is 4, next_start=10^4=10000. Correct.

Now, in Python, computing len(str(current)) for very large numbers (up to 1e16) is okay, but perhaps for numbers up to 1e16, converting to a string is manageable. But what about numbers larger than that? Wait, according to the input constraints, m can be up to 1e16, which when converted to a string is a 17-digit number. So len(str(m)) is 17. So the code will handle that.

But what about when current is 1e16. Then next_start is 10^17. But in Python, 1e16 is 10000000000000000, which is 17 digits, but 10^17 is a 1 followed by 17 zeros. Wait, no. 10^d is 10 to the power of the number of digits. For example, if current is 10^16-1 (9999999999999999, 16 digits), then next_start is 10^16. But current=1e16 (which is 10000000000000000, 17 digits), next_start is 10^17.

Wait, but for m up to 1e16, len(str(m)) could be up to 17 digits. For example, 1e16 is 1 followed by 16 zeros, which is 17 digits. So 10^17 is the next_start. So the code handles that correctly.

Now, the code as outlined is O(log m) steps, since each iteration moves to the next group of digits, which increases the number of digits. So for m up to 1e16, there are at most 17 steps (since each step increases the number of digits by 1, starting from 1-digit numbers up to 17 digits). Each step is O(1) operations, so the code is very efficient, even for the largest possible input.

But wait, in Python, exponentiation can be expensive for very large exponents, but 10^d where d is up to 17 is manageable. 10**17 is 100000000000000000, which is a big integer, but in Python, it's handled as an integer.

So the code should work.

But let's test another example.

Third sample input: 114 5 14.

Output is 6.

Let's compute:

m=5, k=14, w=114.

Each number's cost is digits *14.

Numbers:

5: d=1, cost 14. 114 >=14: yes. How many can we take?

Group starts at 5, next_start is 10. So numbers 5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers. Total cost for group:5*14=70. remaining becomes 114-70=44.

current is now 10. d=2. next_start is 100. max_numbers=90. cost per is 2*14=28. Total cost 90*28=2520. Which is larger than 44.

Possible numbers: 44//28=1. 1*28=28. Remaining 44-28=16. Add 1. So total count is 5+1=6. Remaining 16, but next possible is 11 (next number after 10 is 11, which is 2 digits. But cost is 28 per. 16 <28. So no more.

Thus total 6. Which matches the sample.

So the code works.

So the code is correct.

Now, let's code this in Python.

But for very large m, converting to a string each time could be a problem? For example, m is up to 1e16. len(str(m)) is O(1) in Python. So yes.

Now, the code:

Read w, m, k.

Then, current = m.

count =0

remaining = w

loop:

compute d as len(str(current)).

next_start = 10 **d.

max_numbers = next_start - current.

cost_per = d *k.

if cost_per > remaining: break.

total_cost = max_numbers * cost_per.

if total_cost <= remaining:

    count += max_numbers

    remaining -= total_cost

    current = next_start.

else:

    possible = remaining // cost_per

    count += possible

    remaining -= possible * cost_per

    break.

Check if remaining is zero after each step.

Wait, but after possible is added, the code breaks. Because even if possible is less than max_numbers, but after adding possible, there's no remaining budget.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, implement this.

But note that in Python, when we compute 10 ** len(str(current)), for current=1, len(str(1))=1, 10^1=10. Correct.

So code:

Read the inputs: w, m, k.

But in Python, input is read as a string, then split into integers. So:

w, m, k = map(int, input().split())

But since w can be up to 1e16, which is within Python's integer capabilities.

Then, the loop:

count =0

current = m

remaining = w

while True:

    # compute digits of current

    d = len(str(current))

    next_start = 10 ** d

    max_numbers = next_start - current

    cost_per = d * k

    # check if even one number can be added

    if cost_per > remaining:

        break

    # compute total cost for the group

    total_group_cost = max_numbers * cost_per

    if total_group_cost <= remaining:

        # take all in group

        count += max_numbers

        remaining -= total_group_cost

        current = next_start

    else:

        # take as much as possible

        possible = remaining // cost_per

        count += possible

        remaining -= possible * cost_per

        break

    # check remaining after processing

    if remaining <=0:

        break

print(count)

Wait, but after processing the group and moving to next_start, the loop continues. For example, if current is set to next_start (like 10), but then in the next iteration, len(str(10)) is 2, next_start is 100, and so on.

Yes. So this code should handle all cases.

Now, let's test the code with the samples.

Sample 1:

Input:

9 1 1

Code steps:

current=1, d=1, next_start=10.

max_numbers=9.

cost_per=1*1=1.

total_group_cost=9*1=9 <=9. So count +=9, remaining=0. current=10.

Loop checks remaining, which is 0, breaks. Output 9. Correct.

Sample 2:

77 7 7

current=7, d=1. next_start=10. max_numbers=3. cost_per=7.

total_group_cost=21 <=77. count=3. remaining=77-21=56. current=10.

Next iteration: d=2. next_start=100. max_numbers=90. cost_per=14. total_group_cost=90*14=1260. 1260>56. So possible=56//14=4. count=3+4=7. remaining=56-4*14=0. break. Output 7. Correct.

Sample3:

114 5 14.

current=5. d=1. next_start=10. max_numbers=5 (5,6,7,8,9). cost_per=14. total_group_cost=5*14=70 <=114. remaining becomes 44. current=10.

d=2. next_start=100. max_numbers=90. cost_per=28. total_group_cost=90*28=2520>44. possible=44//28=1. 44-28=16. count becomes 5+1=6. break. Output 6. Correct.

Sample4: input 1 1 2.

current=1. d=1. cost_per=2. remaining=1. 2>1. So loop breaks. count 0. Correct.

Another test case: input 1 1 1. Then cost per is 1. remaining is 1. So max_numbers is 9 (10-1=9). But 9*1=9>1. So possible=1//1=1. count=1. So output 1. Correct.

Another test: w=10, m=9, k=1.

current=9. d=1. next_start=10. max_numbers=1 (9). cost per 1. total cost 1. remaining 10-1=9. current=10.

d=2. next_start=100. max_numbers=90. cost per 2. total cost 180. 180>9. possible=9//2=4. 4*2=8. count=1+4=5. remaining=1. break. Output 5. So numbers 9,10,11,12,13 (costs 1,2,2,2,2. sum 1+2*4=9. which is 9. 5 numbers. Correct.

Yes, the code handles all these cases.

Now, considering that for very large numbers, the code is efficient. For example, if m is 1e16, then len(str(m)) is 17, so next_start is 1e17. Then max_numbers is 9e16. But in the code, this is handled as a single step. So the code is O(number of digit changes), which is O(17 steps for the worst case), which is negligible.

Thus, the code is optimal and handles all cases efficiently.
