Okay, let's see. The problem is about adjusting a melody to fit certain conditions. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest possible melody B that follows the constraints based on the original melody A, and also satisfies the vocal range L to R, and the maximum difference K between consecutive notes.

Hmm. So first, we need to model the constraints. For each consecutive pair in A, we have a relation (increasing, equal, decreasing) that must be mirrored in B. And also, the absolute difference between consecutive B's can't exceed K. Plus, all B's must be between L and R.

The challenge is to find the lex smallest B possible. Lex smallest usually means that we want the earliest possible elements to be as small as possible.

Let's think about how to model the possible ranges for each B_i. For each position i, B_i must be within some range determined by the relations with the previous and next elements. But since the relations can be in either direction (like, for i and i+1), perhaps we need to process the array forward and backward, adjusting the possible ranges, then combine them to find a valid value for each position.

Wait, this sounds familiar. Like, for each position, we need to determine the minimum and maximum possible value that B_i can take, considering both the constraints from the left (previous elements) and the right (next elements). Then, for lex smallest, we take the smallest possible value within the allowed range that also satisfies all constraints.

So the approach might involve two passes: one forward pass to set lower and upper bounds based on previous elements, and a backward pass to adjust these bounds based on the next elements. Then, after combining these, we can check if the ranges are valid and pick the smallest possible values.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, initial setup. Each B_i must be between L and R. But then, for each i, B_i's possible range is further constrained by B_{i-1} and B_{i+1}, based on the relations in A.

But how do we model this? For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] must be less than B[i+1], and the difference can't be more than K. So B[i+1] can be at most B[i] + K, but also must be at least B[i] + 1 (since B[i] < B[i+1]). Wait, no. Because B[i] < B[i+1], but the difference can be up to K. So B[i+1] can be in [B[i] + 1, B[i] + K]. But also, B[i] must be at least B[i-1] + 1 (if the previous relation is increasing), etc.

Alternatively, for each i, we can track the possible min and max values of B[i], considering the relations from both directions.

Let's consider processing the array forward and backward.

In the forward pass, for each i from left to right, we compute the possible range [lo[i], hi[i]] based on the previous element and the relation between A[i-1] and A[i]. For example, if A[i-1] < A[i], then B[i] must be greater than B[i-1], and also B[i] can't be more than B[i-1] + K. So the previous lo and hi for i-1 will affect the current i's lo and hi.

Similarly, in the backward pass, we process from right to left, adjusting the ranges based on the next element's relation.

Wait, perhaps the forward pass sets possible min and max for each B[i] based on the previous elements, and the backward pass then adjusts these based on the next elements. The final valid range for B[i] is the intersection of the forward and backward ranges.

Yes. Let's formalize this.

Forward pass:

Initialize min_forward and max_forward arrays.

For i=0 (first element), min_forward[0] = L, max_forward[0] = R. Wait, no. Wait, the first element must be within L and R. So min_forward[0] is L, max_forward[0] is R.

Then for i from 1 to N-1:

The relation between A[i-1] and A[i] determines the constraints between B[i-1] and B[i].

Case 1: A[i-1] < A[i]. So B[i] must be > B[i-1], and |B[i] - B[i-1]| <= K. So B[i] must be in (B[i-1], B[i-1] + K]. So, the min for B[i] is B[i-1] + 1, max is B[i-1] + K.

But since B[i-1] is in [min_prev, max_prev], then B[i] must be at least (min_prev + 1) and at most (max_prev + K).

But wait, in the forward pass, for each i, we can compute the possible min and max based on the previous i-1's min and max.

So for case 1 (A[i-1] < A[i]):

min_forward[i] = min_forward[i-1] + 1

max_forward[i] = max_forward[i-1] + K

But wait, no. Because if B[i-1] can vary between min_prev and max_prev, then the minimal possible B[i] is (min_prev + 1), and the maximal is (max_prev + K). So min_forward[i] = min_prev + 1, max_forward[i] = max_prev + K.

But then, these must also be within [L, R]. So after computing, we have to cap them to L and R. Wait, no. Because each B[i] must be between L and R. So during the forward pass, after computing the min and max based on the previous step, we have to take the intersection with [L, R].

Wait, no. Because in the forward pass, the min_forward[i] and max_forward[i] are the possible minimum and maximum values for B[i] based on the constraints from the left. But these must also be within the global L and R.

So, during the forward pass, after computing the min and max from the previous step, we take the intersection with L and R. For example:

min_forward[i] = max(prev_min + 1, L)

max_forward[i] = min(prev_max + K, R)

But wait, that's not correct. Because if the relation is A[i-1] < A[i], then B[i] must be greater than B[i-1], and within K. So the possible B[i] is (B[i-1], B[i-1] + K]. So the minimal possible B[i] is B[i-1] + 1, and the maximum is B[i-1] + K. But B[i-1] can vary between min_prev and max_prev (from the previous step). So the overall min for B[i] is min_prev + 1, and the overall max is max_prev + K. Then, after that, we need to clamp this to [L, R], because B[i] must be within L and R.

So during forward pass, for each i, after computing the min and max based on the previous step, we set:

min_forward[i] = max(computed_min, L)

max_forward[i] = min(computed_max, R)

If at any step, min_forward[i] > max_forward[i], then it's impossible.

Then, after the forward pass, we do a backward pass.

In the backward pass, for each i from N-2 down to 0:

We look at the relation between A[i] and A[i+1], and compute the possible min and max for B[i] based on B[i+1]'s min and max.

For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] must be less than B[i+1], and the difference is at most K. So B[i] must be in [B[i+1] - K, B[i+1] - 1]. But B[i+1] can vary between the backward pass's min and max (from i+1's perspective).

So during the backward pass, for each i:

The relation between A[i] and A[i+1] determines how B[i] is constrained by B[i+1].

So let's think about the possible cases for the backward pass.

Case 1: A[i] < A[i+1]. Then B[i] < B[i+1]. Also, |B[i+1] - B[i]| <= K. So B[i+1] - B[i] >=1 and <=K. So B[i] <= B[i+1] -1, and B[i] >= B[i+1] - K.

In the backward pass, we process i and i+1. So during the backward pass, for i, the allowed B[i] is between (B[i+1] - K) and (B[i+1] - 1), but also B[i] must be within L and R.

But during the backward pass, the min and max for i+1 are already computed (since we process from right to left). So for i's backward constraints:

If A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] can be as low as (back_min[i+1] - K) and as high as (back_max[i+1] - 1). But then, the backward pass for i must take this into account.

Wait, maybe the backward pass is similar to the forward pass but in reverse. The backward pass starts from the end and moves left, considering the next element (i+1) in the array.

So during the backward pass, for each i from N-2 downto 0:

We compute the possible min and max for B[i] based on the next element's backward min and max.

Then, the backward min and max for i is the intersection of the forward and backward constraints.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The forward pass gives for each i a [min_forward[i], max_forward[i]] which is the possible range based on the previous elements. But the backward pass will compute another range [min_backward[i], max_backward[i]] based on the next elements.

The actual allowed range for B[i] is the intersection of these two ranges. So for each i, the allowed min is the maximum of min_forward[i] and min_backward[i], and the allowed max is the minimum of max_forward[i] and max_backward[i]. If this min exceeds the max, then it's impossible.

Once we have these combined ranges, we can then construct the lex smallest B by choosing the smallest possible value in the allowed range for each i, ensuring that the chosen value also satisfies the constraints with the next element.

Wait, but even after combining the forward and backward ranges, the selection of B[i] must also be compatible with B[i+1]. Because the forward and backward passes only consider the possible ranges, but the actual assignment must satisfy the pairwise constraints.

Hmm, maybe the two-pass approach is not sufficient. Let's think of an example where after forward and backward passes, the ranges are valid, but there's no possible assignment of B that satisfies all pairwise constraints.

So perhaps we need to process the array in a way that ensures that each step's choice is compatible with both the previous and next elements.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where for each position, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible value, and then greedily assign the smallest possible value that is within the allowed range and also allows the remaining elements to be assigned.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach, choosing the smallest possible B[i] in each step, considering the constraints from the left (previous elements) and the right (future elements).

But how to model the right constraints? Because the future elements depend on the current choice. So this might require some look-ahead.

Alternatively, after the forward and backward passes, we can determine for each i the allowed min and max. Then, when constructing the B array, for each position i, we choose the smallest possible value within the allowed range [current_min, current_max], but also such that the next elements can be assigned values that fit the constraints.

But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

1. Perform the forward pass to compute for each i the min_forward and max_forward ranges.

2. Perform the backward pass to compute for each i the min_backward and max_backward ranges.

3. For each i, the allowed range is [lo, hi], where lo = max(min_forward[i], min_backward[i]), hi = min(max_forward[i], max_backward[i]). If lo > hi at any step, output -1.

4. Now, the problem is to assign B[i] such that B[i] is in [lo[i], hi[i]], and the relations between consecutive elements are satisfied, and the lex order is minimized.

But even after steps 1-3, it's possible that the combined ranges are valid, but there's no way to choose the B[i] such that the consecutive constraints are satisfied. Because the forward and backward passes might have considered only one direction.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the forward pass ensures that the constraints from the left are satisfied, and the backward pass ensures that the constraints from the right are satisfied. So the combined ranges would ensure that for each i, there exists a B[i] that is compatible with both the left and right constraints.

But how to prove that? Let's see.

In the forward pass:

For each i, min_forward[i] and max_forward[i] are the minimal and maximal possible values that B[i] can take, considering all constraints from the left (elements 0 to i-1).

In the backward pass:

For each i, min_backward[i] and max_backward[i] are the minimal and maximal possible values that B[i] can take, considering all constraints from the right (elements i+1 to N-1).

The combined ranges [lo[i], hi[i]] = [max(f_min, b_min), min(f_max, b_max)] would thus represent all possible B[i] values that are compatible with both the left and right constraints. So as long as these ranges are valid (lo[i] <= hi[i] for all i), then there exists a possible B array.

But perhaps this is not the case. Maybe the combined ranges are valid, but no assignment exists. For example, if the combined range for i is [2,3], and for i+1 it's [4,5], and the relation between A[i] and A[i+1] is increasing. Then B[i] must be < B[i+1]. So choosing B[i] =3 and B[i+1] =4 is allowed. So in this case, the ranges are compatible. But perhaps if the combined range for i is [3,3] and for i+1 is [3,3], but the relation requires B[i] < B[i+1], then it's impossible. But in this case, the forward and backward passes would have computed these ranges, but their intersection would lead to lo[i] =3, hi[i]=3, and lo[i+1] =3, hi[i+1] =3. But then, during the forward pass, for i+1, since the relation is increasing, the min_forward[i+1] would be B[i]+1, but if B[i] is 3, then min_forward[i+1] is 4. But if the backward pass allows i+1 to have a min_backward[i+1] of 3, then the lo[i+1] would be max(4,3) =4, but the hi[i+1] would be min( ... ), which would lead to 4 <= ... etc. So perhaps in that case, the combined ranges would have a lo[i+1] higher than hi[i+1], making the overall solution impossible.

So perhaps the two passes are sufficient to capture all constraints. Therefore, if the combined ranges for all i are valid, then a solution exists, and the lex smallest can be constructed by greedily choosing the smallest possible B[i] in each step, considering the constraints from the previous step and the allowed ranges.

So here's the plan:

After computing the combined lo and hi for each i, we can iterate through the array from left to right. For each i, we select the smallest possible B[i] within [lo[i], hi[i]] that is >= (B[i-1] + 1 if A[i-1] < A[i]) or (B[i-1] - K if A[i-1] > A[i], etc.) and also ensures that the next elements can be chosen within their ranges.

Wait, but how can we ensure that selecting the smallest possible B[i] now allows the next elements to have valid options?

This seems like the crux of the problem.

So here's an alternative approach:

Once we have the combined lo and hi for each i, we can greedily choose the smallest possible B[i] in [lo[i], hi[i]], but also making sure that the choice of B[i] allows B[i+1] to be in [lo[i+1], hi[i+1]] and satisfy the constraints.

For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] must be < B[i+1], and the difference between B[i+1] and B[i] must be <= K.

But B[i+1] must be >= lo[i+1] and <= hi[i+1].

So when choosing B[i], we need to make sure that there exists a B[i+1] in [lo[i+1], hi[i+1]] such that B[i] < B[i+1] and B[i+1] - B[i] <= K.

In this case, for the lex smallest B, we want B[i] as small as possible, but also ensuring that B[i+1] can be as small as possible. So perhaps when choosing B[i], we can pick the smallest possible B[i] in its allowed range, but also such that B[i] <= hi[i] and B[i] < B[i+1], and B[i+1] - B[i] <= K.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, during the left-to-right assignment, after selecting B[i], the next step is to set B[i+1] as small as possible, but within the constraints. So perhaps during the assignment, for each i, we first set B[i] to the minimal possible value (lo[i]), but then check if this allows the next elements to be assigned.

Wait, but that could be computationally expensive for large N. We need an O(N) approach.

Alternatively, perhaps once the combined lo and hi ranges are correct, we can proceed greedily by selecting the smallest possible B[i] in the combined range, considering the constraints from the previous B[i-1] and the allowed lo[i] and hi[i].

So here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Compute the forward and backward ranges.

   a. Forward pass:

      - Initialize min_forward[0] = L, max_forward[0] = R.

      - For each i from 1 to N-1:

          - Based on the relation between A[i-1] and A[i], compute the min and max for B[i].

          - For example, if A[i-1] < A[i], then B[i] must be > B[i-1], and <= B[i-1] + K. So the min_forward[i] = min_forward[i-1] + 1, max_forward[i] = max_forward[i-1] + K. Then, clamp these to L and R.

          - If A[i-1] == A[i], then B[i] must equal B[i-1]. So min_forward[i] = min_forward[i-1], max_forward[i] = max_forward[i-1]. Clamp to [L, R].

          - If A[i-1] > A[i], then B[i] must be < B[i-1], and >= B[i-1] - K. So min_forward[i] = max_forward[i-1] - K, max_forward[i] = min_forward[i-1] - 1. Then clamp.

      - After each step, if min_forward[i] > max_forward[i], then it's impossible.

   b. Backward pass:

      - Initialize min_backward[N-1] = L, max_backward[N-1] = R.

      - For each i from N-2 downto 0:

          - Based on the relation between A[i] and A[i+1], compute the min and max for B[i].

          - For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] must be < B[i+1], and B[i+1] - B[i] <= K. So B[i] >= B[i+1] - K and B[i] < B[i+1]. So in the backward pass, since B[i+1] is in [min_backward[i+1], max_backward[i+1]], then the possible B[i] is in [min_b_next - K, max_b_next - 1], where min_b_next is min_backward[i+1], max_b_next is max_backward[i+1].

          - So min_backward[i] = min_b_next - K, max_backward[i] = max_b_next - 1.

          - Then clamp these values to [L, R].

          - If A[i] == A[i+1], B[i] must equal B[i+1]. So min_backward[i] = min_backward[i+1], max_backward[i] = max_backward[i+1].

          - If A[i] > A[i+1], then B[i] must be > B[i+1], and B[i] - B[i+1] <= K. So B[i] >= B[i+1] +1, B[i] <= B[i+1] + K. So min_backward[i] = min_backward[i+1] + 1, max_backward[i] = max_backward[i+1] + K. Then clamp.

          - If any step's min_backward[i] > max_backward[i], return -1.

   c. For each i, compute lo[i] = max(min_forward[i], min_backward[i]), hi[i] = min(max_forward[i], max_backward[i]). If any lo[i] > hi[i], return -1.

2. Once the combined lo and hi ranges are computed, then construct B by selecting the lex smallest possible values.

   a. Initialize B[0] as lo[0], because we want lex smallest. But wait, need to check if this choice allows subsequent elements to be selected.

   Hmm, but here's the problem: choosing B[i] as the minimal possible in its range may not allow the next elements to be chosen. For example, suppose B[i] is set to lo[i], but then the next element's lo[i+1] is higher than what B[i] allows.

   So perhaps the correct way is to greedily set B[i] to the smallest possible value in [lo[i], hi[i]], which also satisfies the constraints from the previous element.

   Wait, but during the forward and backward passes, the constraints from previous and next elements are already considered, so the combined lo and hi should ensure that B[i] can be chosen in such a way that the constraints are satisfied.

   Wait, but maybe not. For example, during the forward pass, we have constraints from the left, and during the backward pass, from the right. But the actual assignment must satisfy both.

   Let me think of an example.

   Suppose N=2, L=1, R=5, K=3.

   A = [1, 2]. So A[0] < A[1], so B[0] < B[1], and B[1] - B[0] <= K.

   Forward pass:

   min_forward[0] = 1, max_forward[0] =5.

   For i=1: since A[0] < A[1], B[1] must be > B[0], and <= B[0]+3.

   So min_forward[1] = 1 +1 =2, max_forward[1] =5+3=8. Clamped to R=5, so max_forward[1] =5. So lo[1] after forward pass is 2, hi[1] is5.

   Backward pass:

   For i=0:

   A[0] < A[1], so B[0] < B[1], and B[1] - B[0] <= K.

   The backward pass starts from i=0, with i+1=1.

   For the backward pass, B[0] must be < B[1], and B[1] - B[0] <= K.

   The backward pass for i=0 is processed after i=1.

   min_backward[1] =1, max_backward[1]=5.

   For i=0, since A[0] < A[1], B[0] can be at most B[1]-1, and at least B[1]-3.

   So min_backward[0] = min_backward[1] -3 =1-3= -2. Clamped to L=1. So min_backward[0] =1.

   max_backward[0] = max_backward[1] -1 =5-1=4. Clamped to R=5. So 4.

   So combined lo[0] = max(1 (from forward), 1 (from backward)) =1. hi[0] = min(5,4) =4.

   So B[0] must be in [1,4], and B[1] must be in [2,5], and B[0] < B[1], with B[1] - B[0] <=3.

   So the lex smallest B is [1, 2]. Which is possible.

   So in this case, during the assignment, B[0] can be 1, then B[1] can be 2.

   So the combined ranges are correct.

   But how to ensure that when choosing B[i] as the minimal possible in [lo[i], hi[i]], the next elements can be chosen.

   Another example: N=2, L=2, R=5, K=3.

   A = [1,2]. Then forward pass for B[0] is [2,5], then B[1] must be in [3, min(5+3,5)] = [3,5]. Backward pass for B[0] must be [ B[1]-3, B[1]-1]. B[1] is in [3,5], so B[0] can be in [3-3=0 (clamped to 2),5-1=4]. So lo[0] is max(2, 2) =2, hi[0] min(5,4) =4.

   So B[0] can be 2,3,4. Then B[1] must be in [3,5], and > B[0].

   If B[0] is 2, then B[1] can be 3 (diff 1 <=3). So lex smallest is 2,3.

   So the approach of choosing B[i] as the minimal possible in [lo[i], hi[i]] and the constraints with the previous element seems to work.

   So here's the plan for constructing B:

   Iterate from left to right.

   For each i, the possible B[i] is in [lo[i], hi[i]], and must satisfy the relation with B[i-1].

   To get the lex smallest B, choose the smallest possible B[i] in [lo[i], hi[i]] that also satisfies the relation with B[i-1], and allows for the next elements to be chosen.

   Wait, but how to handle the next elements? Because even if B[i] is chosen as the smallest possible, if the next elements can't be assigned values within their ranges, then this choice is invalid.

   For example, suppose i=0 is chosen as 1 (min possible), but then i=1 has to be 2 (because A[0] < A[1]), but the next elements' ranges may not allow that.

   However, according to the forward and backward passes, the combined ranges should ensure that for each i, there exists a possible assignment.

   So perhaps the combined ranges are sufficient, and once we have those ranges, we can greedily assign B[i] as the minimal possible value in [lo[i], hi[i]] that also satisfies the constraints from B[i-1].

   So during the assignment:

   B[0] is set to lo[0].

   For i >=1:

   The previous B[i-1] is known.

   We must choose B[i] in [lo[i], hi[i]], and:

   - If A[i-1] < A[i], B[i] must be > B[i-1] and B[i] - B[i-1] <= K.

     So B[i] can be at most B[i-1] + K, but also >= B[i-1] +1.

     So the possible range for B[i] is [B[i-1]+1, B[i-1]+K], but also within [lo[i], hi[i]].

     So the new possible range is the intersection of these two ranges.

   - If A[i-1] == A[i], B[i] must equal B[i-1]. So B[i] must be in [lo[i], hi[i]] and B[i] = B[i-1]. So if B[i-1] is not in [lo[i], hi[i]], it's impossible.

   - If A[i-1] > A[i], B[i] must be < B[i-1] and B[i-1] - B[i] <= K. So B[i] can be as low as B[i-1] - K, and up to B[i-1] -1. So the possible range is [B[i-1]-K, B[i-1]-1], intersected with [lo[i], hi[i]].

   So for each i, after B[i-1] is fixed, the possible B[i] is constrained by both the previous B[i-1] and the combined lo[i] and hi[i].

   So the algorithm would be:

   Initialize B[0] as lo[0].

   Then, for each i from 1 to N-1:

      Determine the relation between A[i-1] and A[i].

      Compute the allowed B[i] based on B[i-1] and the relation.

      The allowed B[i] must be within [lo[i], hi[i]] and satisfy the constraints from B[i-1].

      Then, choose the smallest possible B[i] in that allowed range.

      If there's no such B[i], return -1.

   This approach should work, because the combined lo and hi ranges are derived from forward and backward passes, which ensure that there's at least one possible B[i] in each step.

   But wait, perhaps not. Because during the assignment, the choice of B[i] could restrict the options for B[i+1]. For example, even if B[i] is within the allowed range, but the next step's constraints cannot be satisfied.

   So in this case, even though the combined ranges are valid, the choice of B[i] may leave no valid options for B[i+1].

   For example, let's say:

   N=3, K=2.

   A = [1, 2, 3].

   L=1, R=5.

   Forward pass:

   B[0] in [1,5].

   B[1] must be > B[0], up to B[0]+2. So lo_forward[1] = 2, hi_forward[1] = min(5, 5+2) =5+2=7 but clamped to R=5. So hi_forward[1]=5.

   B[1] is in [2,5].

   B[2] must be > B[1], up to B[1]+2. So lo_forward[2] = 2+1=3, hi_forward[2] =5+2=7 clamped to 5. So [3,5].

   Backward pass:

   B[2] is in [1,5]. For i=1, since A[1] < A[2], B[1] must be <= B[2]-1 and >= B[2] -2.

   So min_backward[1] = (B[2] can be as low as 1) => 1-2= -1, clamped to 1. max_backward[1] =5-1=4.

   So combined lo[1] = max(2,1) =2. hi[1] = min(5,4)=4.

   For i=0, B[0] must be <= B[1]-1, >= B[1]-2. But B[1] is in [2,4].

   So B[0] can be as low as B[1] -2, and up to B[1]-1.

   For B[1] in [2,4], B[0] can be in [0,3]. Clamped to [1,5]. So min_backward[0] is 1, max_backward[0] is 3.

   Combined lo[0] = max(1,1) =1. hi[0] = min(5,3) =3.

   So B[0] is in [1,3], B[1] in [2,4], B[2] in [3,5].

   Now, during assignment:

   B[0] is set to 1.

   B[1] must be >1, <=1+2=3. And B[1] must be in [2,4]. So allowed B[1] is [2,3].

   Choose B[1] as 2.

   Then B[2] must be >2, <=2+2=4. Also must be >=3 (lo[2] is3), so B[2] can be 3 or4.

   Choose 3. So the melody is [1,2,3]. Which is valid.

   Now, if during the assignment, B[1] is chosen as 3 (the minimal possible in this case? Wait, no: the allowed B[1] is [2,3], and the minimal is 2.)

   So the approach works.

   So the algorithm would be:

   For each i from left to right:

      Based on the previous B[i-1], and the relation between A[i-1] and A[i], compute the allowed range for B[i].

      The allowed range is:

         If A[i-1] < A[i]: B[i] must be in (B[i-1], B[i-1] + K], and within [lo[i], hi[i]].

         So the actual allowed range is [max(B[i-1]+1, lo[i]), min(B[i-1] + K, hi[i])].

         If this range is invalid (max > min), return -1.

         Then choose B[i] as the minimal possible value in this range.

      If A[i-1] == A[i]: B[i] must be equal to B[i-1]. So check if B[i-1] is within [lo[i], hi[i]]. If not, return -1. Otherwise, set B[i] = B[i-1].

      If A[i-1] > A[i]: B[i] must be in [B[i-1] - K, B[i-1] -1], and within [lo[i], hi[i]].

         So allowed range is [max(B[i-1] - K, lo[i]), min(B[i-1] -1, hi[i])].

         If invalid, return -1. Choose B[i] as the minimal possible in this range (since lex smallest).

   So this way, the B array is built step by step, ensuring that each step's choice is compatible with the previous element and the combined ranges.

   Now, the key is to compute the forward and backward passes correctly.

   So the steps are:

   - Compute forward min and max.

   - Compute backward min and max.

   - Compute lo and hi for each i.

   - If any lo[i] > hi[i], return -1.

   - Then proceed to assign B[i] from left to right, using the previous B[i-1] and the current constraints.

   Now, let's think about the forward pass.

   For the forward pass:

   Initialize:

   min_forward = [L] * N

   max_forward = [R] * N

   For i from 1 to N-1:

      if A[i-1] < A[i]:

         new_min = min_forward[i-1] + 1

         new_max = max_forward[i-1] + K

      elif A[i-1] == A[i]:

         new_min = min_forward[i-1]

         new_max = max_forward[i-1]

      else:

         new_min = max_forward[i-1] - K

         new_max = min_forward[i-1] - 1

      new_min = max(new_min, L)

      new_max = min(new_max, R)

      if new_min > new_max:

          return -1

      min_forward[i] = new_min

      max_forward[i] = new_max

   Wait, wait. For A[i-1] > A[i], the relation is B[i] < B[i-1], and B[i-1] - B[i] <= K.

   So B[i] can be as low as B[i-1] - K, and up to B[i-1] -1.

   So the minimal possible B[i] is B[i-1] - K (the smallest possible for B[i]).

   The maximal possible B[i] is B[i-1] -1 (the largest possible for B[i]).

   But B[i-1] can be in [min_forward[i-1], max_forward[i-1]].

   So to compute the possible min and max for B[i] in this case:

   The minimal B[i] is (min_forward[i-1] - K) ??? No.

   Wait, no. Because B[i-1] can be up to max_forward[i-1], and B[i] must be at least B[i-1] - K.

   So the minimal possible B[i] is the minimal B[i-1] minus K. Because the minimal B[i] is when B[i-1] is as small as possible. Wait, no: B[i-1] can vary, and B[i] must be <= B[i-1] -1 and >= B[i-1] - K.

   So for all possible B[i-1] in [min_prev, max_prev], what is the minimal and maximal B[i]?

   The minimal B[i] is when B[i-1] is as large as possible (max_prev), so B[i] can be as low as max_prev - K.

   The maximal B[i] is when B[i-1] is as small as possible (min_prev), so B[i] can be as high as min_prev -1.

   So for the forward pass, when A[i-1] > A[i], the min_forward[i] = max_prev - K, and max_forward[i] = min_prev -1.

   Then, clamp to L and R.

   For example, if i-1 has min_prev=3 and max_prev=5, then min_forward[i] =5 - K, and max_forward[i] =3-1=2.

   So for K=3, min_forward[i] =5-3=2. So B[i] must be between 2 and 2. So if K=3, then B[i] is 2.

   Wait, but this depends on K. Hmm.

   So for the forward pass, when A[i-1] > A[i], the new_min and new_max are computed as:

   new_min = max_prev - K

   new_max = min_prev -1

   Then, clamp to [L, R].

   So in code:

   if A[i-1] > A[i]:

      new_min = max_forward[i-1] - K

      new_max = min_forward[i-1] - 1

   So this is the correct way to compute the new_min and new_max.

   For example, suppose A[i-1] > A[i], and K=3.

   Previous min_forward[i-1] = 3, max_forward[i-1] =5.

   Then new_min =5 -3=2.

   new_max =3-1=2.

   So B[i] must be between 2 and 2. So 2.

   So in this case, B[i] is 2.

   Now, during the backward pass:

   For each i from N-2 downto 0:

      based on A[i] and A[i+1], compute the min_backward and max_backward.

      For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], then B[i] must be < B[i+1], and B[i+1] - B[i] <= K.

      So B[i] >= B[i+1] - K and B[i] <= B[i+1] -1.

      So the backward pass for i is based on the backward ranges of i+1.

      So:

      if A[i] < A[i+1]:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1] - K

          new_max = max_backward[i+1] - 1

      elif A[i] == A[i+1]:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1]

          new_max = max_backward[i+1]

      else:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1] + 1

          new_max = max_backward[i+1] + K

      Then clamp new_min and new_max to [L, R].

   For example, if A[i] < A[i+1], and for i+1, min_backward is 3 and max_backward is 5.

   Then B[i+1] can be between 3 and 5. So B[i] must be between 3-K and 5-1.

   So for K=3, new_min is 3-3=0, new_max is5-1=4. Then clamp to L and R.

   So if L is 1, then new_min is 1.

   So during the backward pass, for each i, new_min and new_max are computed based on the i+1's min_backward and max_backward.

   So the code for the backward pass would be:

   min_backward = [0] * N

   max_backward = [0] * N

   min_backward[-1] = L

   max_backward[-1] = R

   for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):

      if A[i] < A[i+1]:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1] - K

          new_max = max_backward[i+1] - 1

      elif A[i] == A[i+1]:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1]

          new_max = max_backward[i+1]

      else:

          new_min = min_backward[i+1] + 1

          new_max = max_backward[i+1] + K

      new_min = max(new_min, L)

      new_max = min(new_max, R)

      if new_min > new_max:

          return -1

      min_backward[i] = new_min

      max_backward[i] = new_max

   Now, after combining the forward and backward ranges:

   For each i:

      lo[i] = max(min_forward[i], min_backward[i])

      hi[i] = min(max_forward[i], max_backward[i])

      if lo[i] > hi[i]:

          return -1

   Then, during assignment:

   Initialize B[0] = lo[0]

   for i in 1 to N-1:

      if A[i-1] < A[i]:

          lower = B[i-1] + 1

          upper = B[i-1] + K

      elif A[i-1] == A[i]:

          lower = B[i-1]

          upper = B[i-1]

      else:

          lower = B[i-1] - K

          upper = B[i-1] - 1

      # Now, the allowed range is [lower, upper] intersected with [lo[i], hi[i]]

      current_low = max(lower, lo[i])

      current_high = min(upper, hi[i])

      if current_low > current_high:

          return -1

      B[i] = current_low

   So for each i, after computing current_low and current_high, we set B[i] to the smallest possible value (current_low).

   This should give the lex smallest B.

   Now, let's test this with the sample input.

   Sample Input 1:

   16 1 8 6

   A = [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,12]

   The output is the lex smallest.

   Let's see how the forward and backward passes work.

   For the first part of the array (the increasing sequence up to 10, then a drop to 3):

   For example, for the first 8 elements (1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10), which are increasing.

   Forward pass for these elements:

   B[0] in [1,8].

   B[1] must be >= B[0] +1, <= B[0]+6. Since B[0] can be up to 8, the max_forward[1] is 8+6=14, but clamped to R=8. So max_forward[1] is 8. min_forward[1] = 1+1=2. So B[1] is [2,8].

   But in the backward pass, for the first 8 elements, the constraints would allow B[0] to be as low as possible.

   But in the combined ranges, during the assignment, B[0] is set to 1.

   Then B[1] is set to 2, and so on up to 8.

   Then, at the 8th element (original A is 10, next is 3, which is a drop. So A[7] > A[8], so B[8] must be < B[7] (which is 8), and >= B[7] -6 = 8-6=2.

   But during the forward pass:

   B[7] is in [7,8]. So when processing B[8], since A[7] > A[8], B[8] must be in [max_forward[7] -6, min_forward[7] -1].

   max_forward[7] (B[7] max) is 8. min_forward[7] (B[7] min) is 7+1=8? Wait, no.

   Wait, let's compute the forward pass for the first 8 elements.

   B[0] is in [1,8].

   B[1] must be in [2,8], since A[0] < A[1].

   B[2] must be in [3, min(8+6=14,8)] → [3,8].

   Similarly, B[3] is [4,8], and so on until B[7] is [8,8], since each step adds 1.

   So for B[7], min_forward[7] = 8, max_forward[7] =8.

   Then, for B[8], since A[7] > A[8], the new_min is max_forward[7] -6 → 8-6=2. new_max is min_forward[7]-1 →8-1=7. So B[8] in [2,7], but clamped to L=1 and R=8. So new_min is 2, new_max 7. So forward pass for B[8] is [2,7].

   Now, the backward pass for B[8] (i=8) depends on the next elements.

   The next elements after 3 in A are 7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,12.

   So during the backward pass, for i=8, A[8] < A[9] (3 <7), so B[8] must be < B[9], and B[9] - B[8] <=6.

   So in the backward pass, B[8] can be as low as B[9] -6 and up to B[9]-1.

   But B[9] is in [lo[9], hi[9]], which in the backward pass is determined by B[10] and so on.

   But this is getting complicated. However, the sample output shows that B[8] is set to 2, which is the minimal possible. So during the assignment phase, after the combined ranges are valid, the code would choose the minimal possible B[i].

   Now, during the assignment phase, after the first 8 elements are set to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, then for B[8], the previous B[7] is 8. The relation is A[7] > A[8], so B[8] must be <8 and >=8-6=2. So allowed range for B[8] is [2,7], and the combined lo and hi must be [2,7]. So B[8] is set to 2.

   Then, for B[9], since A[8] < A[9], B[9] must be >2 and <=2+6=8. Also, the combined lo and hi for B[9] must be such that this is possible. The sample output sets B[9] to 3, which is the minimal possible.

   So the algorithm seems to work.

   Now, let's code this.

   But we need to handle large N (up to 1e5), so the code must be efficient.

   So steps:

   1. Read N, L, R, K.

   2. Read A as a list.

   3. Compute forward min and max.

   4. Compute backward min and max.

   5. Compute lo and hi for each i. Check if any lo[i] > hi[i], return -1.

   6. Assign B[i] step by step, left to right.

   7. If at any step the allowed range is invalid, return -1.

   Now, in code:

   For handling large N, the code must be O(N) time and space.

   Let's proceed.

   First, compute the forward pass.

   Then, compute the backward pass.

   Then, compute lo and hi.

   Then, assign B[i] step by step.

   Let's code this.

   Edge cases to consider:

   - N=1. Then B must be between L and R. So if L<=R, output L. Else, -1.

   - All elements in A are equal. So B must be all equal, within L and R.

   - When K is very large (like 1e9), but the constraints are still possible.

   Now, let's code this.

   Sample Input 3:

   16 1 10 10

   A = [1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,1,11,12,13]

   Output is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4.

   Let's see the assignment steps.

   For example, at i=12 (original A[12] is 1), the previous element is 9 (A[11] =9, A[12] =1: A[11] > A[12]). So B[12] must be < B[11], and B[11] - B[12] <=10.

   B[11] is 4. So B[12] must be <=3, >=4-10= -6. Clamped to L=1. So allowed range is [1,3]. So B[12] is 1.

   Then, the next element (A[12] < A[13]), so B[13] must be >1, <=1+10=11. But in the combined ranges, B[13] is set to 2.

   So the algorithm works.

   Now, code:

   First, read N, L, R, K.

   Then read A.

   Then compute forward min and max.

   Then compute backward min and max.

   Then compute lo and hi.

   Check if any lo[i] > hi[i], output -1.

   Else, assign B.

   Let's code this.

   But for N up to 1e5, using arrays of size N is acceptable.

   So code in Python:

   Read input.

   Handle N=0? No, N >=1.

   Now, code:

   Read N, L, R, K.

   A = list of integers.

   if N ==0:

       ... but N >=1.

   Compute forward min and max:

   min_forward = [L] * N

   max_forward = [R] * N

   for i in range(1, N):

       if A[i-1] < A[i]:

           new_min = min_forward[i-1] + 1

           new_max = max_forward[i-1] + K

       elif A[i-1] == A[i]:

           new_min = min_forward[i-1]

           new_max = max_forward[i-1]

       else:

           new_min = max_forward[i-1] - K

           new_max = min_forward[i-1] -1

       new_min = max(new_min, L)

       new_max = min(new_max, R)

       if new_min > new_max:

           print(-1)

           exit()

       min_forward[i] = new_min

       max_forward[i] = new_max

   Then backward:

   min_backward = [L] * N

   max_backward = [R] * N

   for i in range(N-2, -1, -1):

       if A[i] < A[i+1]:

           new_min = min_backward[i+1] - K

           new_max = max_backward[i+1] -1

       elif A[i] == A[i+1]:

           new_min = min_backward[i+1]

           new_max = max_backward[i+1]

       else:

           new_min = min_backward[i+1] + 1

           new_max = max_backward[i+1] + K

       new_min = max(new_min, L)

       new_max = min(new_max, R)

       if new_min > new_max:

           print(-1)

           exit()

       min_backward[i] = new_min

       max_backward[i] = new_max

   Then compute lo and hi:

   lo = [max(f, b) for f, b in zip(min_forward, min_backward)]

   hi = [min(f, b) for f, b in zip(max_forward, max_backward)]

   for i in range(N):

       if lo[i] > hi[i]:

           print(-1)

           exit()

   Then assign B.

   Initialize B = [lo[0]]

   for i in range(1, N):

       prev = B[i-1]

       a_prev = A[i-1]

       a_curr = A[i]

       if a_prev < a_curr:

           lower = prev +1

           upper = prev + K

       elif a_prev == a_curr:

           lower = prev

           upper = prev

       else:

           lower = prev - K

           upper = prev -1

       # Now, allowed range is between lower and upper, and between lo[i] and hi[i]

       current_low = max(lower, lo[i])

       current_high = min(upper, hi[i])

       if current_low > current_high:

           print(-1)

           exit()

       B.append(current_low)

   Then, print B.

   But in the sample input 3, after the 12th element (B[12] =1), the next element (A[12] < A[13], so B[13] must be >1 and <=1+10=11. The combined lo and hi for B[13] is [2, ...], so B[13] is set to 2.

   So the code works.

   Now, let's test this code against the samples.

   Sample Input 1:

   16 1 8 6

   A is as given.

   The code should compute the correct lo and hi ranges, then assign B as per the sample output.

   Now, the code should output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8.

   Let's see.

   For the first 8 elements, the forward pass allows B[i] to be up to 8. The backward pass for i=7 (the 8th element) would require B[7] to be equal to B[8] - ... but since the sample output sets B[7] to 8, which is allowed.

   Then, during the assignment phase, B[8] is set to 2.

   So the code should handle that.

   Now, the code in Python:

   But in Python, for N=1e5, creating lists of size N is manageable.

   So this should be efficient enough.

   Now, code:

   Read the inputs.

   Compute the forward and backward passes.

   Check lo and hi.

   Assign B.

   So this should work.

   So the code is as follows.
