<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The robot starts at X=0 and wants to reach X=n. Each segment is part of the path from i-1 to i. For each segment, the robot can choose to use either the battery or the accumulator. But there are certain rules when using each. The goal is to maximize the number of segments passed before running out of both energy sources.

The key points are:

- Battery and accumulator have capacities b and a, respectively. They start at full charge.
- When using the battery on a sunny segment (s_i=1), the accumulator's charge increases by 1 (but can't exceed its max a).
- Using the battery: battery decreases by 1. If the segment is sunny, accumulator is recharged if possible.
- Using the accumulator: accumulator decreases by 1, regardless of the sun.

So the problem is to choose for each segment whether to use battery or accumulator, in a way that maximizes the steps taken before both are exhausted.

The output is the maximum number of segments the robot can pass.

Constraints: n up to 2e5. So O(n) algorithms are needed.

Approach:

We need to model the state of the battery and accumulator as the robot moves step by step. At each step, the robot can choose to use either, but subject to the current charges.

We need to track the current battery and accumulator levels. But since n is up to 2e5, a DP approach with states (b_charge, a_charge) is impossible because the values can be up to 2e5 each. So that's not feasible.

So perhaps we can find a greedy strategy. Because the optimal path would be to use the accumulator first when possible, or the battery in a way that maximizes future steps. Wait, but maybe not. Let's think.

The accumulator can only be recharged when the battery is used on a sunny segment. So using the battery on sunny segments can allow the accumulator to gain charge, which can be useful for later steps.

But the accumulator can be used on any segment. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to prioritize using the accumulator when it's not possible to gain charge for it, and use the battery when it can recharge the accumulator.

Wait, but when the accumulator is full, using the battery on a sunny segment doesn't help. So maybe:

- For each step, if the current segment is sunny, using the battery here would allow the accumulator to recharge (if possible). But if the accumulator is already full, then there's no gain. So perhaps, when the accumulator is not full and the segment is sunny, using the battery here is better to charge the accumulator.

But the robot can only proceed until either the steps are all done, or both battery and accumulator are empty.

So how to model this?

Let's think of the problem as making a choice at each step: use battery or accumulator. We need to make choices that maximize the steps.

At each step, the possible choices depend on the current battery and accumulator levels. The decision affects future steps.

But since the state space is too big for DP, we need a greedy approach.

Alternative idea: always prefer to use the accumulator first, but when the segment is sunny and the accumulator is not full, use the battery here to charge it. Wait, but that might not always be optimal.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to use the battery when the segment is sunny (to gain accumulator charge if possible) and use the accumulator otherwise. But need to balance the usage to maximize the steps.

Another approach: track the current battery and accumulator levels, and for each step, choose the option that maximizes the remaining steps.

But how to model this? Since it's step by step, perhaps we can greedily decide which option to take based on current conditions.

Let me think of the variables:

current_b: remaining battery (starts at b)
current_a: remaining accumulator (starts at a)

For each step i from 0 to n-1:

If we can choose to use accumulator:

If current_a > 0, then using it will decrease a by 1. But the battery remains. But this choice might leave the battery for later steps where using it would generate a charge.

Alternatively, using the battery here (if possible) might allow the accumulator to charge (if s_i is 1 and a is not full).

So perhaps the optimal approach is to use the accumulator when:

- The segment is not sunny, and using the battery here doesn't help recharge the accumulator.

But how to balance this.

Let me think of the example:

First example:

n=5, b=2, a=1

s: 0 1 0 1 0

In the first step (s_1 is 0), the robot uses the accumulator (a becomes 0). Then the next segment is sunny (s_2=1). The robot uses the battery (b becomes 1), which allows the accumulator to charge to 1. Then the next steps can use the accumulator again.

So here, the choice was to save the battery for a sunny segment where it can recharge the accumulator.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to save battery usage for segments where s_i is 1, and use the accumulator when possible on non-sunny segments.

But when s_i is 1 and the accumulator is not full, using the battery here will recharge the accumulator, which can be used in the future. So using the battery here is better.

So here's a possible strategy:

At each step, prefer to use the accumulator if possible (current_a >0), unless the segment is sunny and the accumulator is not full. In that case, use the battery (if possible) to recharge the accumulator.

But how to model this.

Let's try to model the process:

We need to track current_b, current_a.

For each step i (from 1 to n):

Check if we can proceed (either current_b or current_a >0).

If yes:

If s_i is 1:

   If current_b >0 and current_a < a:

      Use battery: current_b -=1. current_a = min(current_a +1, a)

   Else if current_a >0:

      Use accumulator: current_a -=1

   Else if current_b >0:

      Use battery: current_b -=1

   else: can't proceed.

Else (s_i is 0):

   Prefer to use accumulator first.

   If current_a >0:

      use accumulator: current_a -=1

   else:

      use battery: current_b -=1

But this might not cover all cases. Let's test with the examples.

First example:

Segments: 0 1 0 1 0 (indexes 0 to 4, but the problem's input is s_1 to s_5. Wait, the problem says the second line is s_1, s_2, ..., s_n. So for 5 segments.

So in the first example:

At step 1 (s_1=0):

We are in the s_i=0 case.

current_a is 1 (initial a=1).

So use accumulator. current_a becomes 0.

Step 2 (s_2=1):

s_i is 1. Check if current_b (2) >0 and current_a (0) < a (1). Yes. So use battery: current_b=1, current_a=1.

Step 3 (s_3=0):

s_i=0. current_a=1. So use accumulator. current_a=0.

Step 4 (s_4=1):

s_i=1. current_b=1>0, current_a=0 <1. So use battery. current_b=0. current_a becomes 1.

Step5 (s_5=0):

current_a=1>0. Use accumulator. current_a=0.

Total steps:5. Which matches the example.

Second example:

Input:

6 2 1

s:1 0 0 1 0 1

Output is 3.

Let's see. According to the strategy:

Initial current_b=2, current_a=1.

Step1 (s=1):

s_i=1. current_b>0, current_a=1 is equal to a (1). So can't recharge. So check if current_a>0. current_a is 1. So use accumulator: current_a=0. Now, we have current_b=2, current_a=0.

But s_i is 1 here. Alternatively, perhaps the strategy is not correct here.

Wait, according to the strategy for s_i=1:

If s_i is 1 and current_b>0 and current_a < a: use battery.

In this case, current_a is 1, which is equal to a (1). So current_a is not less than a. So the first condition is false. Then check if current_a>0: yes. So use accumulator.

So after step 1, current_a=0.

Step 2 (s=0):

s_i=0. Use accumulator if possible. But current_a is 0. So use battery. current_b=1.

Step3 (s=0):

current_a is 0. Use battery. current_b=0.

Now, after 3 steps, battery and accumulator are 0. So output 3. Which matches the example.

So the strategy works here.

Another example: suppose a segment is sunny, but the accumulator is full. Then, using the battery here won't recharge the accumulator, so the choice is between battery and accumulator. But perhaps using the accumulator here saves the battery for other uses.

Wait, for example: a segment is sunny, and the accumulator is full. Then, if we use the accumulator here, we decrease the accumulator. But if we use the battery here, the accumulator remains full (so no gain). So in this case, perhaps using the accumulator here is better, as the battery can be saved for a later segment where s_i is 0, where the accumulator can't be used.

So the strategy's approach for s_i=1 is:

If possible, use the battery here to recharge the accumulator (if the accumulator is not full). Otherwise, use whichever is available.

But when the accumulator is full, using the battery here gives no gain. So in that case, it's better to use the accumulator if possible.

So the strategy for s_i=1 is:

If using battery here can recharge the accumulator (i.e., current_a is not full), then use battery. Else, prefer to use the accumulator first (since using the battery here would not help, and using the accumulator preserves battery for non-sunny segments where it's needed).

So the strategy seems to hold.

So the algorithm can be:

Initialize current_b = b, current_a = a.

max_steps = 0

for each step from 1 to n:

    if current_b == 0 and current_a ==0:

        break

    if s_i is 1:

        # sunny segment

        if current_b >0 and current_a < a:

            # can use battery here to recharge accumulator

            use battery: current_b -=1

            current_a +=1

            if current_a >a: current_a =a

        else:

            # cannot gain charge, use whichever is possible

            if current_a >0:

                use accumulator: current_a -=1

            elif current_b >0:

                use battery: current_b -=1

            else:

                break

    else:

        # not sunny

        # prefer to use accumulator first to save battery for sunny days

        if current_a >0:

            use accumulator: current_a -=1

        elif current_b >0:

            use battery: current_b -=1

        else:

            break

    max_steps +=1

So this approach seems to work for the examples. Let's test another scenario.

Test case where using battery on a sunny segment when the accumulator is full is not helpful. For example:

n=3, b=3, a=1

s = [1,1,0]

Initial a=1 (full). So for the first two steps (s_i=1):

In step 1:

s_i=1. current_a is 1 (full). So cannot recharge. So we check if current_a is >0. Yes. Use accumulator. current_a becomes 0.

Step 2: s_i=1. Now, current_a is 0. current_b is 3. So use battery here (since current_a <a (1)). current_b becomes 2. current_a becomes 1.

Step3: s_i=0. current_a is 1, so use accumulator. current_a becomes 0. So steps taken: 3.

But what if in step 2, we used battery instead of accumulator in step 1?

Alternative approach: step1 uses battery. So current_b=2, current_a becomes 1+1=1 (since a is 1). Then step2: again use battery (current_a is 1, so cannot recharge). So current_b=1, current_a remains 1. step3: use accumulator. So total steps 3. Same as before.

So the strategy would work the same.

Another scenario: when using battery on a non-sunny segment. For example:

n=2, b=1, a=1.

s = [0, 0]

Step1: non-sunny. Use accumulator. a becomes 0. step2: non-sunny. Use battery. So total steps 2.

Another scenario: when there are multiple sunny segments and the accumulator can be recharged.

n=4, b=2, a=1.

s = [1,1,1,0]

Initial a=1.

Step1: s=1. current_a is 1 (full). So strategy uses accumulator (since current_a>0). current_a becomes 0.

But then, step2: s=1. current_b=2>0, current_a=0 <1. So use battery. current_b=1, current_a becomes 1.

step3: s=1. current_b=1>0, current_a=1 (full). So use accumulator (since current_a>0). current_a=0.

step4: s=0. current_a=0, use battery. current_b=0.

Total steps 4.

So in this case, the strategy works.

So the algorithm seems to work. Let's code this.

Now, considering the constraints, the code must process up to 2e5 steps, which is O(n), so acceptable.

So the code would:

Read n, b, a.

Read the s array.

Initialize current_b = b, current_a = a.

max_steps =0

for each s_i in s:

    if current_b ==0 and current_a ==0:

        break

    if s_i ==1:

        # sunny

        if current_b >0 and current_a < a:

            current_b -=1

            current_a +=1

            if current_a >a:

                current_a =a

        else:

            if current_a >0:

                current_a -=1

            elif current_b >0:

                current_b -=1

            else:

                break

    else:

        # not sunny

        if current_a >0:

            current_a -=1

        else:

            current_b -=1

    max_steps +=1

print(max_steps)

Wait, but in the code, after checking s_i, and handling, then increment max_steps. But the loop is over each segment. So for each step, the code runs once.

Wait, but the s array is of length n, as each of the n segments. So the code loops through all elements of s.

Now, in code:

In Python:

Read the inputs:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, b, a = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    s = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    current_b = b

    current_a = a

    max_steps =0

    for si in s:

        # Check if both are empty

        if current_b ==0 and current_a ==0:

            break

        if si ==1:

            # sunny

            if current_b >0 and current_a < a:

                current_b -=1

                current_a = min(current_a +1, a)

            else:

                # choose either a or b, whichever is available

                # prefer a first

                if current_a >0:

                    current_a -=1

                elif current_b >0:

                    current_b -=1

                else:

                    break

        else:

            # not sunny, use a first

            if current_a >0:

                current_a -=1

            else:

                if current_b ==0:

                    break

                current_b -=1

        max_steps +=1

    print(max_steps, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [

        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

    print('Tests passed 😎')

```

Second example:

s = [1,0,0,1,0,1]

current_b=2, current_a=1.

Step1 (si=1):

current_a is 1 (full). So check if current_b>0 and current_a <a (a is 1). current_a is not less than a. So else clause. use a. current_a=0. steps=1.

Step2 (si=0):

current_a=0. use battery. current_b=1. steps=2.

Step3 (si=0):

use battery. current_b=0. steps=3.

Now, next steps (si=1,0,1):

But current_b and current_a are 0. So loop breaks. steps=3.

So code returns 3.

Another test case where using battery when possible to charge:

n=3, s = [1,1,1], b=3, a=1.

Step1: use battery (since a is 0 (after initial a=1? Wait, initial a is 1. So step1:

si=1, current_b=3>0, current_a=1 (a=1). So can't recharge. So use a. current_a=0. steps=1.

step2: si=1. current_b=3>0, current_a=0 <1. So use battery. current_b=2. current_a=1. steps=2.

step3: si=1. current_b=2>0, current_a=1. So cannot recharge. So use a. steps=3.

Total steps 3. But using battery again here would allow steps 3, but a is 1.

Hmm. So steps are 3.

But the code seems correct.

So the code should work. Now, let's code it.
</think>

```python
n, b, a = map(int, input().split())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))
current_b, current_a = b, a
max_steps = 0

for si in s:
    if current_b == 0 and current_a == 0:
        break
    if si == 1:
        if current_b > 0 and current_a < a:
            current_b -= 1
            current_a = min(current_a + 1, a)
        else:
            if current_a > 0:
                current_a -= 1
            elif current_b > 0:
                current_b -= 1
            else:
                break
    else:
        if current_a > 0:
            current_a -= 1
        else:
            if current_b == 0:
                break
            current_b -= 1
    max_steps += 1

print(max_steps)
```
