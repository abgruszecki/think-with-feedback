<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem says we need to calculate the sum of a & b for each step where b is divided by 2 (right shift) until it becomes zero. And then take the sum modulo 998244353.

First, let's understand the process. For each iteration, we compute the bitwise AND of a and b, add that to the answer, then right shift b by 1 bit. Repeat until b is zero.

But since a and b are very large (up to 2e5 bits each), we can't process them as actual integers. We need a way to compute the sum efficiently without iterating each bit every time.

Wait, the bitwise AND of a and b would be a number where all the bits that are 1 in both a and b are set. So for each position where a has a 1, we need to check how many times that position in b is 1 across all shifts. Then multiply by the corresponding power of two for that bit position, and sum all those contributions.

Oh right! Because each bit in a contributes to the sum whenever the corresponding bit in b (after shifting) is 1. But since after each step, b is shifted right, the positions of the bits in b are effectively moving. So for a bit in a at position i (counting from the least significant bit, which is the rightmost?), and a bit in b at position j, how do their positions align during each shift?

Wait, let's think about the positions. Let's consider the binary numbers as strings. Suppose a is given as a string of length n, with the first character being the most significant bit (MSB). Similarly for b. For example, if a is "1010", that's 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 10 in decimal.

When we compute a & b, each bit in the result is the AND of the corresponding bits of a and b. But when b is shifted right (divided by 2), it's like moving the bits to the right, and the next step's b is shorter by one bit.

Wait, for each iteration:

1. Compute a & current_b, add to sum.
2. current_b = current_b >> 1 (right shift, which is equivalent to integer division by 2).

So the process continues until current_b is zero.

Let's model this. Let's say the original a is a binary number, and the original b is also a binary number. The initial a is fixed, and the initial b is fixed. Then, each step, b is shifted right once. But since we can't store these as numbers, we need to find a way to compute the sum over all shifts.

Let me think of each bit in a and each bit in b. For a given bit in a at position i (where the LSB is position 0), how many times does a 1 in that position contribute to the sum? It would depend on how many times the corresponding bit in b (after shifting) is 1. Wait, no. Because when you shift b, the bits move. So the j-th bit (from the right, 0-based) in the original b will, after k shifts, be in position j - k. But this is only possible if j >= k. Otherwise, the bit has been shifted out.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider for each bit in a and each bit in b, how their positions align during the shifts.

Let me index the bits of a and b as follows:

- For a: the original string is a_0 a_1 ... a_{n-1}, where a_0 is the MSB (leftmost), and a_{n-1} is the LSB (rightmost). So the value of a is sum_{i=0 to n-1} a_i * 2^{n-1 - i}.

Wait, no. Wait, for example, "1010" as a binary number is 8 + 2 = 10. So the first character is 1 (2^3), then 0 (2^2), then 1 (2^1), then 0 (2^0). So the positions in the string are 0-based from left to right, each representing a power of 2^(n-1 - i). So for a string of length n, the i-th character (starting at 0) is the coefficient of 2^{n-1 - i}.

Similarly for b: the j-th character in the string (0-based) represents 2^{m-1 - j}.

Now, when we perform the process, each step shifts b to the right (equivalent to integer division by 2). So the first step is original b. Then after k shifts, the current b is b's original value shifted right by k bits. So the original bits of b are in positions j, and after k shifts, the bit at position j in the original b will be in position j - k. But only if j >= k. Otherwise, it's shifted out and no longer part of b.

So, for each bit in a (bit a_i, which is in position i of the a string, contributing 2^{n-1 -i} when set), and for each bit in the original b (bit b_j, contributing 2^{m-1 -j} when set), we need to find all the shifts k where the a's bit and the shifted b's bit are both 1. Then, the contribution of a_i and b_j is 1 when a_i is 1, and during a shift k where the original b's bit j is at position j -k in the shifted b, and that position in a is the same as the shifted bit's position. Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let's think of each bit in a at position i (in the a's string, which corresponds to 2^p where p is the exponent, which is (n-1 -i) for a's i-th bit). For each such a's bit, during the k-th shift of b (starting from 0 shifts), the current b is shifted right by k bits, so the original b's bits are now in positions j >=k. The shifted b's bit at position (j -k) in the original is now in position (j -k) of the shifted b. But the a's bit is at position (n-1 -i) in terms of its value. Wait, no, the a's bit is part of the binary number a, so in the AND operation, each bit of a is aligned with the corresponding bit of b (shifted).

Wait, when we compute a & current_b, each bit in the result is 1 only if both a's bit at position s and current_b's bit at position s are 1. But current_b is the original b shifted right by k times. So during the k-th step (0-based?), current_b is the original b shifted right by k bits. So the bits of current_b are the original b's bits j >=k. So for each bit in current_b at position s, it's the original b's bit j = s +k.

So during the k-th iteration, the AND is computed between a and (b >> k). So the bits that contribute are those where a has a 1 and (b >>k) has a 1 in the same position.

So for each bit position s in a and (b >>k), we check if both are 1. The value of this is 2^s. So the sum over all k is the sum for each s of (number of times a's s-th bit is 1 and (b >>k)'s s-th bit is 1) multiplied by 2^s.

But how can we model this for all possible k?

Alternatively, for each bit in a, we can determine how many times during the process the corresponding bit in the shifted b is 1. Multiply that by the value of the bit in a (0 or 1) and the power of two for that position. Sum all these.

Wait, that's a good way to model it. Let's break it down:

For each bit position s in the binary numbers (from 0 to ...), the contribution to the sum is:

a_has_s * b_shifted_has_s_count * 2^s

Where a_has_s is 1 if a has a 1 in position s, else 0.

b_shifted_has_s_count is the number of times, during the iterations, that the shifted b (after k shifts) has a 1 in position s.

So the total sum is the sum over s of (a_has_s * (number of shifts where shifted b has 1 in s) * 2^s).

But how do we compute a_has_s and the count for each s?

First, let's note that the positions s are determined by the lengths of a and b. The maximum possible s is the maximum of (n-1 + shifts) or something? Wait, perhaps for a given a and b, the maximum s that can contribute is the maximum between the bit positions in a and the bit positions in shifted b.

Wait, in a's binary representation, the highest bit is 2^{n-1} (since a has n bits, and starts with 1). So the bits in a are at positions from 0 to n-1 (but that's not correct in terms of the actual binary digits). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the a string is given as a binary number of length n. The first character is the most significant bit. So for example, "1010" (n=4) is 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10. The bits here are at positions 3, 2, 1, 0. So each character in the a string corresponds to a power of 2 equal to (n-1 - index). So the i-th character in the a string (0-based) is the coefficient for 2^{n-1 - i}.

Similarly for the b string. The j-th character in the b string is the coefficient for 2^{m-1 - j}.

So when we compute a & (b >> k), each bit in the result is 1 if and only if a has 1 at position s and (b >>k) has 1 at position s. But (b >>k) is the original b shifted right by k bits, which effectively removes the first k bits (the most significant ones) and shifts the rest. So (b >>k) has bits in positions s where s ranges from 0 to (m-1 -k). The original b's bit at position j (0-based in the string) is in the (j -k) position of (b >>k) if j >=k. Otherwise, it's not present.

So, for a given s (the bit position in the result of a & (b >>k)), the (b >>k) has a 1 at position s only if there exists a j >=k such that j -k = s (i.e., j = s +k) and the original b's j-th bit is 1. But j must be within the original b's bits, i.e., s +k < m (since j ranges from 0 to m-1). Wait, j can't exceed m-1. So s +k <= m-1.

So for (b >>k) to have a 1 at position s, the original b must have a 1 at position j = s +k, and k can be up to (m-1 -s), since j must be <= m-1.

So for a given s, the number of times (across all shifts k) that (b >>k) has a 1 at position s is equal to the number of k where (s +k < m) and b's bit at position (s +k) is 1.

But k starts from 0 and increments each step. However, the process stops when b becomes zero. So the maximum k is when the original b shifted by k bits is zero. The maximum possible k is (number of bits in original b) - 1, but since after each shift, the length decreases by 1. The original b has m bits, which is at least 1 (since it starts with 1). So the number of shifts possible is exactly m steps (including the initial step where k=0? Wait, no. Let's see: when you have a binary number of m bits, how many times can you shift right until it becomes zero? For example, for m=4 (like 1000), after 4 shifts, it becomes 0. Because:

Original is 1000 (8 in decimal). Shift once: 100 (4), then 10 (2), then 1 (1), then 0. So 4 shifts. So the number of shifts is m, but the loop runs until b is zero, which takes m steps. So for each k from 0 to m-1 inclusive, because after m shifts, the b is zero and the loop stops.

So for each possible shift k (0 <= k <= m-1), we have (b >>k) as the value in the k-th iteration. So the process runs exactly m times, but only adds to the sum when (b >>k) is non-zero. Wait, no. Because after each shift, even if (b >>k) is zero, in the next iteration, the loop condition is b >0. So the process stops when b becomes zero. So the number of iterations is the number of shifts until (b >>k) becomes zero. Which is when the original b shifted by k bits is zero. For a binary number starting with 1, the maximum shifts possible is m. For example, the original number is of m bits. After m-1 shifts, it becomes 1 (since the first bit is 1, then after shifting m-1 times, the remaining is 1 followed by m-1 zeros shifted away, leaving 1). Then one more shift (k = m) gives zero. But wait, how many shifts until zero?

Wait, the original b is a m-bit number. For example, m=4: 1000 (8) becomes 100 (4) after 1 shift, 10 (2) after 2, 1 (1) after 3 shifts. Then after 4 shifts, it's 0. So the loop runs 4 times (k from 0 to 3?), but during the fourth iteration (k=3), the shifted value is 1, which is non-zero. Then after processing, b is shifted once more (k=4) and becomes zero. So the number of iterations is m.

So for each k in 0 to m-1, inclusive, we have the shifted value (b >>k). So the total number of iterations is m.

So, for each s (bit position in the AND result), the count of shifts where (b >>k) has a 1 in position s is equal to the number of k such that s +k < m (because j = s +k must be a valid index in the original b string, which is 0-based up to m-1). So 0 <= k <= m-1-s.

For each such k, if the original b's j-th bit (j = s +k) is 1, then it contributes 1 to the count for s.

So the count for s is the number of positions j in the original b where j >=s (since j = s +k implies k = j -s, and since k >=0, j >=s). But j must also be <= m-1. So j can range from s to min(s + (m-1 -s), m-1). Wait, no. For each j in the original b, if j >= s, then k can be j -s. But since k must be <= m-1 (because the maximum k is m-1). So j -s <= m-1. So j <= s + (m-1) → j <= m-1 + s. But j can't be larger than m-1. So j ranges from s to m-1. So for each j in [s, m-1], the corresponding k is j -s. The count is the number of j in this range where b's j-th bit is 1.

But j can't exceed m-1, so the count is the number of 1s in the original b's bits from j=s to j=m-1.

Wait, that's a key insight! For a given s, the count of shifts k where (b >>k) has a 1 in position s is equal to the number of 1s in the original b's bits starting from position s (since for j >=s, each j in the original b's bits contributes to a k = j -s). So the count for s is the number of 1s in b from j=s to j=m-1.

But wait, j must be >=s and <=m-1. So the count is the sum of b_j for j from s to m-1.

But how do we compute this efficiently for all s?

We can precompute a prefix sum array for the original b's bits. Wait, but since the bits are in the original order (MSB to LSB), and the bits are given as a string, let's see.

The original b's bits are in positions 0 (MSB) to m-1 (LSB). For example, if the string is '1101', then the bits are j=0 (1), j=1 (1), j=2 (0), j=3 (1). So the value is 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 =13.

So for each j in 0 to m-1, the bit at position j is b_j (0 or 1). For a given s, the count of 1s is the number of j >= s where b_j is 1. So the count is the sum of b_j for j in [s, m-1].

To compute this efficiently, we can precompute a suffix sum array for b. Let's create an array suffix_b where suffix_b[s] is the number of 1s from position s to m-1 in the original b. This can be computed by iterating from the end (m-1) to the start (0) and accumulating the sum.

Once we have this suffix sum array, for any s, the count is suffix_b[s].

Now, for a's bit position. Let's consider each bit in a. The a's string is given as a string of n bits. The i-th character (0-based) in a's string represents a bit at position (n-1 -i). So the first character (i=0) is the MSB (2^{n-1}), and the last character (i=n-1) is the LSB (2^0).

So for each i in 0 to n-1, the a's bit is a_i (0 or 1) and it's at position s_a = n-1 - i. So for example, if a's string is '1010' (n=4), then the positions are 3, 2, 1, 0 for i=0,1,2,3. So for i=0 (s_a=3), the value is 8.

So for each a's bit at i (0-based in the string), which is at position s_a = n-1 -i, if a_i is 1, then it contributes to the sum when the shifted b has a 1 in position s_a. The count of such shifts is suffix_b[s_a], but only if s_a <= m-1. Because if s_a >= m, then there are no j >= s_a in the original b (since j can be up to m-1). So in that case, suffix_b[s_a] would be 0.

So the contribution from a's bit i is:

if a_i == '1' and s_a < m:

    contribution += 2^{s_a} * suffix_b[s_a]

else if a_i == '1' and s_a >= m:

    contribution += 0 (since suffix_b[s_a] is zero)

But wait, when s_a >= m, then in the original b, j >=s_a is impossible (since j can be up to m-1). So the count is zero.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the suffix sum array for the original b, which for each s in 0..m-1 gives the number of 1s from position s to m-1. For s >=m, it's zero.

2. For each bit in a (i from 0 to n-1):

   a. Compute s_a = n-1 -i (the bit position in terms of the power of 2).

   b. If a's bit is '1' and s_a < m, then the contribution is (1) * (suffix_b[s_a] if s_a <m else 0) * 2^s_a.

   c. Sum all such contributions, modulo 998244353.

Wait, but wait: the maximum possible s_a is n-1 (when i=0). So if n-1 < m, then for some a's bits, s_a could be in the range of 0 to m-1. Otherwise, some s_a may be >=m.

For example, if a is of length 5 (n=5), then the maximum s_a is 4. If m=3, then s_a=4 is >=m, so any a's bits with s_a >=3 will not contribute.

So, the plan is:

- Precompute suffix_b for s in 0..m-1.

- For each a's bit at position s_a (from 0 to n-1):

   - If a's bit is '1', then check if s_a < m. If yes, then add 2^s_a multiplied by suffix_b[s_a] to the answer.

But wait, no. Because s_a can be up to n-1. For example, if a has n=2e5 and m=2e5, then s_a can be up to 2e5-1. But suffix_b is only up to m-1. So for s_a >=m, suffix_b[s_a] is zero (since j cannot be >=s_a if s_a >=m).

So the steps are:

Compute for each a's bit:

   s_a = n-1 -i (i is the index in a's string, 0-based from left to right).

   if a's character is '1' and s_a < m:

       add (2^s_a) * suffix_b[s_a] to the answer.

   else:

       no contribution.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

- Compute the suffix sum of the bits in b.

- For each bit in a, compute s_a, check if it's <m and a's bit is 1. If so, multiply 2^s_a by suffix_b[s_a] and add to the answer.

But how to compute 2^s_a mod 998244353?

We can precompute the powers of 2 modulo 998244353 up to the maximum possible s_a, which is n-1. Since n can be up to 2e5, precomputing these is feasible.

So here's the plan:

1. Read n, m.

2. Read a's string and b's string.

3. Precompute the suffix_b array for s from 0 to m-1.

   a. Iterate j from m-1 down to 0:

      - suffix_b[j] = (b[j] == '1') + (suffix_b[j+1] if j+1 <m else 0)

4. Precompute pow2 up to max_s = max(n-1, m-1) or similar. Because the maximum s_a is n-1, and for suffix_b, s can be up to m-1. So the maximum exponent needed is max(n-1, m-1). Since n and m are up to 2e5, precomputing up to 2e5 is manageable.

   a. pow2[0] =1, pow2[k] = (pow2[k-1] * 2) mod MOD.

5. Iterate over each bit in a's string. For each i (0-based), compute s_a =n-1 -i. If a[i] is '1' and s_a <m, then add (pow2[s_a] * suffix_b[s_a]) to the answer.

Now, let's test this against the examples.

First example:

Input:
4 4
1010 (a)
1101 (b)

a's bits:

i=0: '1' → s_a =3. Since m=4, 3 <4. So contributes 2^3 * suffix_b[3].

suffix_b for b's string (1101):

For j from 3 downto 0:

j=3 (bit '1') → suffix_b[3] =1 + suffix_b[4] (which is 0) →1.

j=2 (bit '0') → suffix_b[2] =0 + suffix_b[3] →1.

j=1 (bit '1') → suffix_b[1] =1 + suffix_b[2] →2.

j=0 (bit '1') → suffix_b[0] =1 + suffix_b[1] →3.

So for s_a=3:

pow2[3] =8. suffix_b[3] =1 → contribution 8 *1=8.

Then i=1: a's bit is 0 → no contribution.

i=2: a's bit is 1 → s_a =4-1 -2=1. s_a <4.

pow2[1] =2. suffix_b[1] is 2. 2*2=4.

i=3: a's bit is 0 → no.

Wait, wait. Wait, the a string is '1010', which is indexes 0,1,2,3: '1', '0', '1', '0'.

So for i=0, s_a=3. a[i] is '1' → contribute 8 * suffix_b[3] (1) →8.

i=1: a[i] is '0' → no.

i=2: a[i] is '1' → s_a =4-1-2=1. pow2[1] is 2. suffix_b[1] is 2. 2*2=4.

i=3: a[i] is '0' → no.

But according to the first example, the sum is 8+2+2+0=12.

Wait, but according to our method, the sum is 8 (from i=0) + 2*2 (from i=2, s_a=1) → 8 +4=12. Which matches the example. Oh right! Because the a's bit at s_a=3 (i=0) contributes 8 (from the first step), then the a's bit at s_a=1 (i=2) contributes 2 * 2 (since during shifts where s=1 in (b>>k), the count is suffix_b[1] =2. So 2 shifts where (b>>k) has a 1 at position 1. But according to the example, there are two steps where this contributes. Let's see:

In the first example:

Steps:

k=0: b is 1101 (s=3 for a's bit 3) → AND with a's bit 3 (8) gives 8.

Then, for the a's bit at position 1 (s=1, which is 2^1=2):

We need to count how many times in the shifted b, there's a 1 at position 1.

In the original b (1101), j ranges for s=1:

j >=1. The bits at j=1, 2,3 are 1,0,1. So the count is 2 (j=1 and j=3). Wait, but j must be s +k =1 +k. For each k, j=1 +k must be in the original b (<=3). So:

k can be 0,1,2,3? Wait, for s=1, j =1 +k. But j must be <=3 (since original b has m=4 bits, j up to 3).

So:

For k=0: j=1 → bit is 1.

k=1: j=2 → bit 0.

k=2: j=3 → bit 1.

So total 2 instances where b's j=1 and j=3 are 1. So count is 2. So the a's bit at s=1 (2^1) contributes 2 * 2 =4. Summing 8+4 gives 12. Which matches the example.

So our approach is correct.

The second example:

Input:
4 5
1001 (a)
10101 (b)

a's bits:

i=0: '1' → s_a=3 (n=4, 4-1-0=3). m=5. 3 <5. So contribute 2^3 * suffix_b[3].

b's suffix sum:

The b is '10101' (m=5). Let's compute suffix_b:

j starts from 4 downto 0.

j=4 (bit '1') → suffix_b[4] =1.

j=3 (bit '0') → 0 + suffix_b[4] =1.

j=2 (bit '1') →1 + suffix_b[3]=2.

j=1 (bit '0') →0 + suffix_b[2] =2.

j=0 (bit '1') →1 + suffix_b[1] =3.

So suffix_b[3] is 1 (j=3, sum of j=3,4: 0+1=1).

For s_a=3: 2^3 *1 =8.

a's i=0 contributes 8.

Other a's bits:

i=1: '0' → no.

i=2: '0' → no.

i=3: '1' → s_a=4-1 -3=0. m=5 → s_a=0 <5. suffix_b[0] is 3. 2^0 *3=3. So contribute 3.

Additionally, a's i=0 contributes 8, and i=3 contributes 3. But according to the example, the sum is 1+8+1+0+1=11.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's see: the a's bits are '1001', which is '1' at i=0 (s_a=3), '0' at i=1 (s_a=2), '0' at i=2 (s_a=1), and '1' at i=3 (s_a=0).

So:

i=0: s_a=3. 2^3 * suffix_b[3] =8 *1 =8.

i=3: s_a=0. 1 * suffix_b[0] =3. So 8+3=11. Which matches the example. But according to the example's breakdown, the sum is 1+8+1+0+1=11. How does our approach account for that?

Ah, because in the example:

In the first step (k=0), the shifted b is 10101 (k=0). The a is 1001 (binary 9).

a & b is 1001 & 10101. Let's compute that:

1001 in binary is 9 (8+1). 10101 is 21 (16+4+1). The AND is 1 (since only the LSB is 1 in both). So the first contribution is 1.

But according to our approach, the contribution from a's bit s_a=0 (LSB) is 1 * suffix_b[0] =3. But why?

Because during all shifts k where (b >>k) has a 1 in position 0. The count for s=0 is the number of 1s in the original b's bits from j=0 to j=4. Which is 3 (bits at j=0, 2,4 are 1). So for s=0, the count is 3. So the contribution is 1*3=3.

But in the example, during the iterations, the LSB of a (s=0) contributes when the shifted b's LSB is 1. For each k, the shifted b's LSB is j=k (since s=0 → j =0 +k). So during shifts k=0,1,2,3,4:

k=0: j=0 → b's bit is 1 → contributes 1.

k=1: j=1 → b's bit is 0 → no.

k=2: j=2 → b's bit is 1 → contributes 1.

k=3: j=3 → b's bit is 0 → no.

k=4: j=4 → b's bit is 1 → contributes 1.

Total of 3 contributions. So 3 *1 (a's bit) * 2^0 =3. So that's correct.

But in the example, the a's LSB is contributing three times. So the approach works.

So the approach is correct.

Now, to implement this:

We need to:

- Compute suffix_b for the original b.

- Precompute pow2 up to max(n-1, m-1).

But wait, for s_a can be up to n-1, which is up to 2e5-1. So precomputing pow2 up to 2e5 is needed.

So steps in code:

Read n, m.

Read a as a string.

Read b as a string.

Compute suffix_b for b:

Initialize a list suffix_b of size m+2 (to handle s up to m-1). Start from the end.

suffix_b = [0]*(m+1)  # 0-based up to m-1.

for j in range(m-1, -1, -1):

    suffix_b[j] = (1 if b[j] == '1' else 0) + suffix_b[j+1]

Then precompute pow2:

max_pow = max(n-1, m-1)

pow2 = [1]*(max_pow +1)

for i in range(1, max_pow+1):

    pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] *2 ) % MOD

Then iterate through each bit in a:

ans =0

for i in range(n):

    if a[i] == '1':

        s_a = (n-1) - i

        if s_a < m:

            count = suffix_b[s_a]

            ans = (ans + pow2[s_a] * count) % MOD

print(ans)

Wait, but how to handle cases where s_a >=m? In that case, count is zero, so no contribution.

So this code should work.

Testing this on the first example:

n=4, m=4.

a is '1010'.

b is '1101'.

suffix_b for b:

j=3: 1 → suffix_b[3] =1.

j=2: 0 +1=1.

j=1:1 +1=2.

j=0:1 +2=3.

But wait, the original code's suffix_b[j] is the sum from j to m-1. So for the first example, suffix_b[3] is 1, j=2 is 0+ suffix_b[3] =1. j=1:1 + suffix_b[2] =2. j=0:1 + suffix_b[1] =3.

So when s_a=3 (i=0 in a):

pow2[3] =8, count is suffix_b[3] =1 → 8*1=8.

When s_a=1 (i=2 in a):

pow2[1] is 2, count is suffix_b[1]=2 → 2*2=4. Sum is 8+4=12.

Which matches.

The second example:

a is '1001' (n=4). For i=3 (s_a=0), count is suffix_b[0] =3. pow2[0] is 1. Contribution 3.

For i=0 (s_a=3), suffix_b[3] is 1. pow2[3] =8. 8*1=8. Sum is 3+8=11. Which matches.

So the code should work.

Now, considering the constraints:

n and m are up to 2e5. All loops are O(n), O(m), so acceptable.

The suffix_b array can be built in O(m) time. The pow2 array in O(max(n,m)) time. The final loop is O(n).

So total time is O(n + m + max(n,m)), which is acceptable for 2e5.

Now, handling the MOD correctly (mod 998244353) is important.

Potential edge cases:

- a and b have maximum lengths (2e5), and all bits are 1. Then the suffix_b for s=0 would be m. For each a's bit, s_a =n-1 -i. For i from 0 to n-1, s_a ranges from n-1 downto 0. For each s_a <m, the contribution would be 2^s_a * (m -s_a). Summing all such terms.

But this would be manageable.

Another edge case: a is longer than b. For example, n=2e5, m=1. Then most of a's bits have s_a >=m (since m=1, s_a can be 2e5-1, which is >=1). Only those a's bits with s_a <1 (i.e., s_a=0) contribute. Which is possible only when i =n-1 (since s_a =n-1 -i =0 → i =n-1).

But in code, the check 's_a <m' handles that.

Now, code:

MOD = 998244353

Read n, m.

a = input().strip()

b = input().strip()

Compute suffix_b:

m_b = len(b) # should be m.

But since the input ensures that the second line is exactly n bits and the third is m bits.

Compute suffix_b:

suffix_b = [0]*(m+1) # indexes 0..m.

for j in range(m-1, -1, -1):

    suffix_b[j] = (1 if b[j] == '1' else 0) + suffix_b[j+1]

Compute pow2:

max_pow = max(n-1, m-1)

pow2 = [1]*(max_pow+1)

for i in range(1, max_pow+1):

    pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] *2 ) % MOD

ans =0

for i in range(n):

    if a[i] == '1':

        s_a = (n-1) - i

        if s_a < m:

            ans = (ans + pow2[s_a] * suffix_b[s_a]) % MOD

print(ans)

Yes, this should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 998244353

    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    a = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    b = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    # Compute suffix sum for b
    suffix_b = [0] * (m + 1)  # suffix_b[j] is sum from j to m-1
    for j in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        suffix_b[j] = (1 if b[j] == '1' else 0) + suffix_b[j+1]

    max_pow = max(n-1, m-1)
    pow2 = [1] * (max_pow + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_pow + 1):
        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD

    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == '1':
            s_a = (n-1) - i
            if s_a < m:
                result = (result + pow2[s_a] * suffix_b[s_a]) % MOD

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4 5
1001
10101
""",
            "output": \
"""\
11
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example:

4 5

1001

10101

suffix_b for b (m=5):

j=4:1 → suffix_b[4] =1.

j=3:0 +1=1 → suffix_b[3]=1.

j=2:1 +1=2 → suffix_b[2]=2.

j=1:0 +2=2 → suffix_b[1]=2.

j=0:1 +2=3 → suffix_b[0]=3.

max_pow is 4 (n-1=3, m-1=4).

pow2[0]=1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (up to 4).

a's bits:

i=0: '1', s_a=3. 3 <5 → pow2[3] is 8. suffix_b[3] is 1 → 8*1=8.

i=1: '0' → no.

i=2: '0' → no.

i=3: '1', s_a=0. 0 <5 → pow2[0] is 1. suffix_b[0] is3 → 3. Sum 8+3=11.

Yes.

So the code works for the examples.

Therefore, this approach is correct and efficient.

```python
MOD = 998244353

n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = input().strip()
b = input().strip()

# Compute suffix sum for b
suffix_b = [0] * (m + 1)  # suffix_b[j] is sum from j to m-1
for j in range(m-1, -1, -1):
    suffix_b[j] = (1 if b[j] == '1' else 0) + suffix_b[j+1]

max_pow = max(n-1, m-1)
pow2 = [1] * (max_pow + 1)
for i in range(1, max_pow + 1):
    pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD

result = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == '1':
        s_a = (n-1) - i
        if s_a < m:
            result = (result + pow2[s_a] * suffix_b[s_a]) % MOD

print(result)
```
