Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of stable arrays of length k that are strictly increasing and within 1 to n. The definition of a stable array is such that any permutation of the array doesn't change the result of the mod operations for any x. 

Hmm, first, I need to understand what makes an array stable. Let's think about the condition. For any permutation p of the array, the sequence of mod operations must yield the same result. So, the order of the elements in the array doesn't matter for the final mod result. What's the property that allows this?

Let's consider small examples. Suppose the array has elements a1, a2, ..., ak. Let's think about the mod operations. The mod operation is not commutative. However, for the result to be the same regardless of the order, the elements must somehow constrain each other. 

Maybe the key is that all elements after the first one are divisors of the first element. Wait, no. For example, take the array [2,4]. Let's see. If x is 5, then (5 mod 2) mod 4 is 1 mod4 =1. If we reverse the order, (5 mod4) mod2 is 1 mod2=1. So that works. But 4 is a multiple of 2. Wait, but what if the array is [2,3]. Then for x=3: (3 mod2) mod3 is 1 mod3=1. If reversed: (3 mod3) mod2 is 0 mod2=0. Which is different. So that array isn't stable. So the order matters here. 

So the array [2,4] might be stable. Let's check other values. For x=5: same as above. For x=6: (6 mod2) mod4 is 0 mod4=0. Reverse order: (6 mod4) mod2 is 2 mod2=0. Same. For x=7: (7 mod2)=1, mod4 is1. Reverse: (7 mod4)=3 mod2=1. So yes. So perhaps if the elements are in the form where each element is a multiple of the next? Or maybe all elements after the first are divisors of the first. Wait, in the array [2,4], the second element is a multiple of the first. Hmm, but when the order is reversed, [4,2], the mod operations might behave differently. Wait, but the array is considered stable if any permutation gives the same result. So the original array could be in any order, but since the problem requires the array to be strictly increasing, the permutation here refers to any reordering. So the original array is in increasing order, but the permutations can be any order, and for all x, the mod operations must yield the same result regardless of the permutation.

Wait, but the problem states that the array is stable if for every permutation of the array's elements, the mod sequence gives the same result. So the array's elements must be such that their order does not affect the result of the mod operations. So what's the structure of such an array?

An important observation here is that the stable array must consist of elements where all elements after the first are divisors of the first element. Because modding by a larger number first and then a smaller can lead to different results. Let's see. Suppose the array is [a, b], where a < b. Then, (x mod a) mod b would be x mod a, since x mod a is less than a < b. But (x mod b mod a) is equivalent to (x mod b) mod a. Which is x mod (gcd(a,b)), perhaps. Wait, no. For example, x mod b can be up to b-1. Then mod a gives (x mod b) mod a. So unless a and b have some relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps all elements except the first can be divisors of the first. Let me think. If the array is in any order, then modding by the elements in any order must give the same result. Let's say the array is [a, b, c], and a is the maximum element. Then, if all other elements are divisors of a, then modding by a first would give a remainder less than a. Then modding by the other elements (which are divisors of a) would have a certain structure. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of [4,2]. If x is 5: mod 4 first gives 1, mod 2 gives 1. If we do mod 2 first (x mod2 is 1, mod4 is 1. So same result. So in this case, the order doesn't matter. So if the elements are such that each element is a divisor of the first element, then the order might not matter. Because modding by a divisor of a in any order would end up modding by the maximum element first? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the array must have all elements except the first one be 1. But that's not possible because the array is strictly increasing, so the first element would be 1, but then the next elements can't be 1. So that's only possible when k=1.

Another approach is to find the necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be stable. Let's think of the minimal such array. For example, in the first sample input (7,3) the answer is 16. So for k=3, n=7, there are 16 stable arrays. Let's see what these arrays look like. Let's suppose that the arrays are of the form [a, a*d1, a*d1*d2], where each subsequent element is a multiple of the previous. Wait, but how does that ensure the stability?

Alternatively, perhaps the first element is a, and all other elements are divisors of a, and each subsequent element is a divisor of the previous. But the array is strictly increasing, so each element must be larger than the previous. So divisors of a must be in increasing order and divisors. But that's not possible unless the array is [a, a], but since the array is strictly increasing, that's not allowed. So this line of reasoning might not be correct.

Wait, maybe the stable arrays are those where all elements after the first are equal to the first element. But since the array must be strictly increasing, this is impossible. So that's not it.

Another idea: The result of applying the mod operations in any order must be equivalent to the result of applying them in some specific order, such as the maximum element first, followed by the next largest, etc. So if the maximum element is applied first, then all subsequent mod operations can't increase the value. Then, perhaps the maximum element determines the result. For example, modding by the maximum element first gives a value less than the maximum, and then modding by smaller elements (which are all larger than the remainder) would leave it unchanged. Wait, no. If the maximum element is applied first, then the remainder is x mod max, which is less than max. Then modding by any of the other elements, which are less than max, would take the remainder again. But if the array is in any order, then the maximum element must be the first to be modded, otherwise, the other elements might affect the result. 

Wait, perhaps the stable arrays are those where all elements are divisors of the maximum element. Because then, modding by the maximum first would give a remainder that is then modded by the divisors, but since those divisors divide the maximum, their mod would be equivalent to mod the remainder by the divisors. But if the array is in any order, then the maximum is the first element in the original array (since it's strictly increasing). Wait, the array is strictly increasing, so the maximum is the last element. So for example, if the array is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], then a_k is the maximum. So the order in which permutations are considered could include permutations where a_k is not the first element. So in that case, modding by a_k first would leave a remainder less than a_k, but if a_k is not the first element in the permutation, then modding by other elements first could lead to a larger intermediate value. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find the condition that must be satisfied for the array to be stable. Let's consider that for all x, the result of modding in any order is the same. Let's think about the maximum element in the array. Let m be the maximum. Suppose the array has m as one of its elements. Then, when processing x mod any permutation, if m is the first element in the permutation, then the remainder is x mod m, and then subsequent mods by the other elements (which are <= m) can't increase it. But if the permutation starts with some other element a_i < m, then x mod a_i can be up to a_i -1, which is less than m. Then modding by m next would leave it as is. But then modding by other elements in the permutation could change it. 

Wait, but for the result to be the same regardless of permutation, the order in which the mods are applied must not affect the final value. So perhaps the maximum element m must be present, and all other elements must divide m. Because then, any permutation's mod operations would result in x mod m, followed by mods by the divisors of m. But how?

Alternatively, the maximum element must be the smallest element in the array. But that's not possible unless k=1. So this approach may not be correct.

Let's think about when all elements except the maximum are divisors of the maximum. Let m be the maximum. Then, any permutation's mod sequence would start with mod m (if it's in the permutation) first, giving x mod m. Then, modding by the other elements (divisors of m) would take the remainder modulo each of them. However, since the other elements are divisors of m, perhaps the order doesn't matter. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that all elements except the maximum must divide the maximum. Let's see. Suppose the array is [a1, a2, ..., a_{k-1}, m], where m is the maximum. And all a_i's divide m. Then, for any permutation, if we process m first, the remainder is x mod m, then modding by a_i (divisors of m) would be x mod m mod a_i, which is equivalent to x mod a_i. But if the permutation processes m not first, then the initial mods are by a_i (divisors of m). For example, suppose the permutation is [a_i, m]. Then x mod a_i gives some value less than a_i, then mod m leaves it as is. So the result is x mod a_i. But if the permutation is [m, a_i], then the result is x mod m mod a_i, which is x mod a_i. So both permutations give the same result. 

Wait, but x mod a_i mod m is the same as x mod a_i, since a_i divides m. Because x mod a_i is less than a_i, and m is a multiple of a_i, so mod m leaves it as is. But in the permutation [a_i, m], the result is (x mod a_i) mod m = x mod a_i. Then mod m is x mod a_i mod m, which is x mod a_i. Then, in the permutation [m, a_i], the result is (x mod m) mod a_i, which is x mod a_i. So these are the same. So in this case, the order doesn't matter. 

So if all elements except the maximum are divisors of the maximum, then the array is stable. Because regardless of the order in which you mod, the final result is x mod a_1 mod a_2 ... mod a_k. But if all a_i's (except m) divide m, then the final result would be x mod (the minimal a_i?), or x mod the GCD of all elements. Wait, perhaps the final result is x mod the minimal element in the array. Or maybe x mod the GCD of the elements. Let's see. 

Suppose the array is [2,4,8]. Then m is 8. All elements are divisors of m. For any x, applying the mods in any order would result in x mod 2. Let's see. For example, x=10. Mod 8 first gives 2. Then mod 4 gives 2 mod4=2. Then mod2 gives 0. But x mod 2 is 0. Wait, that's different. Hmm, maybe my assumption is incorrect here. 

Wait, let's take x=10. The array [2,4,8]. Let's try different permutations:

Permutation [8,4,2]: (10 mod8) mod4 mod2 → 2 mod4 mod2 → 2 mod2 →0.

Permutation [2,4,8]: (10 mod2=0) mod4=0 mod8=0. So result is 0. Same as before. 

Another permutation [4,8,2]: (10 mod4=2) mod8=2 mod2=0. So same result. 

Another example x=5. Original permutation: 5 mod2=1, mod4=1, mod8=1 →1. Any other permutation: 5 mod8=5, mod4=1, mod2=1. Or 5 mod4=1 mod8=1 mod2=1. So same result. 

Hmm, so in this case, the result is x mod the minimal element. Because the minimal element is 2. So for any x, the result is x mod 2. 

So if the array is [d, 2d, 4d, ...], where all elements are multiples of the minimal element, then the final result is x mod d. Because modding by any larger multiples would leave the remainder mod d, but then mod d again. Wait, but modding by a larger multiple first would give a remainder mod d. Let's see. Suppose the array is [d, m], where m is a multiple of d. Then x mod m mod d is (x mod m) mod d, which is x mod d. Because x mod m is x - km, and m is a multiple of d, so x mod m mod d is x mod d. Similarly, x mod d mod m is x mod d, which is then mod m (since x mod d is less than d < m) so remains x mod d. So in this case, regardless of order, the result is x mod d. 

So the minimal element in the array is d, and all other elements are multiples of d. Then, for any x, the result of applying the mods in any order is x mod d. So the array is stable. 

Thus, the condition for the array to be stable is that all elements are multiples of the minimal element. Moreover, the minimal element must be the first element in the array (since the array is strictly increasing). Wait, no. Because the array is strictly increasing, the minimal element is the first one, a_1. So if the array is [d, ...], and all other elements are multiples of d, then any permutation will have modding operations that, when applied in any order, will give x mod d. Thus, the array is stable. 

So the problem reduces to counting the number of strictly increasing arrays of length k, where the first element is d (for some d), and all subsequent elements are multiples of d, and all elements are <=n. 

Wait, but this seems to fit the first sample input. Let's check. 

Sample Input 1:
7 3 → Output 16.

Let's see. For d=1: the array has elements [1, a2, a3], where a2 and a3 are multiples of 1 (so any a2 and a3> a2), up to 7. So the count for d=1 is the number of combinations of 2 elements from 2 to 7, but since the array must be strictly increasing and of length 3 (including the 1). Wait, the array is [1, a2, a3], with a2>1 and a3> a2, and a2 and a3 can be any numbers <=7. So the number of possible arrays for d=1 is C(m, 2), where m is the number of elements greater than 1 and <=7. Since 7-1=6 elements. So C(6,2) = 15. 

But sample output is 16. So there's another case. So d must be allowed to be other values. 

Wait, what's the sample output for d=2? For example, possible arrays where the first element is 2, and all subsequent elements are multiples of 2. So possible elements after 2 are 4,6. So for k=3, we need 3 elements. So the array would be [2,4,6]. So for d=2, how many options? The elements after 2 must be multiples of 2. So the array has to be [2, a2, a3], a2>2, a3> a2. So the possible elements are 4,6, etc. Let's see: for d=2, the elements must be multiples of 2. So the possible numbers are 4,6,8... but n=7. So possible elements after 2 are 4,6. So for k=3, we need two elements after 2. The possible options are 4 and 6. So the array is [2,4,6]. So that's 1 array. So adding to d=1's 15 gives 15+1=16, which matches the sample. So yes. 

So the approach is to find all possible d (the minimal element in the array) such that there are at least (k-1) elements in the array that are multiples of d, and all elements are in increasing order and <=n. 

So the problem reduces to:

For each d from 1 to n, find the number of ways to choose (k-1) elements from the set {d*2, d*3, ..., m} where m is the maximum multiple of d <=n. Then sum these counts over all possible d where such a selection is possible. 

Wait, because the array must be strictly increasing and start with d. So the first element is d. The next elements must be multiples of d, and larger than the previous element. So the elements after d must be multiples of d, strictly increasing, and greater than d. 

So for each d, the possible elements after d are the multiples of d greater than d and <=n. Let's call the count of such elements as t. Then, the number of possible arrays for this d is C(t, k-1) if t >=k-1. 

So for example, in the first sample:

n=7, k=3.

For d=1: possible multiples after 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7. So t=6. We need to choose k-1=2 elements. So C(6,2)=15.

For d=2: possible multiples after 2 are 4,6. t=2. So C(2,2)=1. Total 15+1=16.

For d=3: multiples after 3 are 6. t=1. We need 2 elements, which is impossible. So no contribution.

Similarly, higher d's (d>=4) will have t <2 (since 4*2=8>7, etc.), so no contribution.

Thus, the sum is 15+1=16. Which matches the sample. 

So the problem now is to compute, for all possible d, the number of combinations C(t, k-1), where t is the number of multiples of d greater than d and <=n. 

But how do we compute this efficiently?

Constraints are up to 5e5 for n and k. So O(n) approaches are acceptable.

So for each d from 1 to n:

- compute the number of multiples of d that are >d and <=n. That is, floor(n/d) -1. Because the multiples are 2d, 3d, ..., up to m*d where m is floor(n/d). So the count is floor(n/d) -1. Let's call this t.

Wait, for example, d=2, n=7:

floor(7/2)=3 → multiples are 2*2=4, 3*2=6 → 3-1=2 elements. Which is correct.

So t = floor(n/d) -1.

But for d=1, floor(7/1)=7 → t=6, which is correct.

So for each d, t = (n // d) -1.

But we need to count the number of combinations C(t, k-1) if t >=k-1. Sum over all d.

So the problem becomes: compute the sum over d=1 to n of C( (n//d) -1, k-1 ), but only when (n//d)-1 >=k-1 → n//d >=k.

Wait, because for (n//d)-1 >= k-1 → (n//d) >=k → n//d -1 >=k-1.

So the steps are:

1. For each d from 1 to n:

   a. compute t = (n//d) -1.

   b. if t >=k-1, then add C(t, k-1) to the answer.

   c. else, add 0.

But how to compute this for large n (up to 5e5) and k up to 5e5?

The problem is that computing combinations C(t, k-1) for varying t and k could be computationally expensive if done naively. Also, when k is large, many d's will not contribute anything (since t has to be >=k-1 → (n//d)-1 >=k-1 → n//d >=k → d <= n//k).

But for k=5e5, n=5e5, n/k=1. So d can be at most 1, so for k>1, there's no solution. So the code needs to handle these cases efficiently.

So the plan is:

- Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo 998244353 up to the maximum possible t. What's the maximum possible t? For d=1, t = n//1 -1 = n-1. Since n can be up to 5e5, we need to precompute up to 5e5-1.

So precompute factorial and inv factorial arrays up to 5e5.

Then, for each d, compute t = (n//d) -1. If t <k-1, skip. Else, compute comb(t, k-1) as (fact[t] * inv_fact[k-1] * inv_fact[t - (k-1)]) % mod.

But wait, the combination C(t, r) is zero if t <r. So in code, for each d, if t >=r (r=k-1), then compute C(t, r), else 0.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute fact and inv_fact up to 5e5.

2. Iterate d from 1 to n:

   a. compute t = (n//d) -1.

   b. if t >= r (r=k-1), then add C(t, r) to the answer.

   c. else, add 0.

But for n up to 5e5 and k up to 5e5, this loop is O(n). For each iteration, it's O(1) to compute t and check.

But wait, when k is 1, then r=k-1=0. So C(t, 0) is 1 for any t >=0. So when k=1, each d contributes 1 (since t=(n//d)-1 >=0 when d<=n). But wait, when k=1, the array is [d], which is valid as long as 1<=d <=n. So the answer should be n. Which matches the sample where input is 500000 1, output 500000.

So the code needs to handle k=0? Wait, but the problem says k is at least 1. Because the constraints are 1<=k<=5e5.

So for k=1, the answer is the number of d's where (n//d)-1 >=0. Which is all d's <=n. So sum over d=1 to n of C(t, 0) = sum 1 for each d. So n.

So the code for k=1 will return n, which is correct.

So the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, the next step is to implement this.

But precomputing factorials up to 5e5 is manageable.

But wait, the maximum possible t is (n//d)-1. For d=1, t=5e5-1. So for n up to 5e5, the maximum t is 5e5-1. So precomputing up to 5e5 is sufficient.

So precompute fact up to 5e5, inv_fact up to 5e5.

But how to precompute factorial mod 998244353?

We can compute fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i mod mod.

Compute inv_fact using Fermat's little theorem. Since mod is a prime, inv_fact[i] = pow(fact[i], mod-2, mod). But for large i, precomputing inv_fact in reverse order is better.

Yes:

Compute fact[0] = 1.

for i in 1 to max_n:

   fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i mod mod.

Compute inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], mod-2, mod).

for i in max_n-1 down to 0:

   inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) mod mod.

This way, inv_fact[i] = 1/(i!) mod mod.

Then, combination C(n, k) is fact[n] * inv_fact[k] * inv_fact[n-k] mod mod.

So for each d, compute t = (n//d)-1.

If t >= r (r =k-1), then compute C(t, r) as (fact[t] * inv_fact[r] % mod) * inv_fact[t-r] % mod.

Sum all such terms.

But wait, when r=0, C(t,0) is 1. So for k=1, r=0, and we need to sum for each d where t >=0. Since t = (n//d) -1 >=0 → n//d >=1 → d <=n. Which is all d from 1 to n. So sum is n*1= n, which is correct.

Thus, the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, the code steps:

Read n and k.

If k==0: not possible, since constraints say k>=1.

If k==1: output n mod 998244353.

Else:

r =k-1.

If r > max_t (which is when for some d, t can be up to 5e5-1. So if r>5e5-1, then all terms are 0. So if r>5e5-1, then the answer is 0. Because for the maximum possible t, which is when d=1, t=5e5-1. If k-1 is larger than that, then no solution.

So first check if r>5e5-1. If yes, output 0.

Else precompute fact and inv_fact up to 5e5.

Then, for each d from 1 to n:

t = (n//d) -1.

if t >=r:

   add comb(t, r) to the answer.

Else, add 0.

Sum all these and mod 998244353.

But for n up to 5e5, the loop is O(5e5), which is acceptable.

But what about the precomputing step? For n=5e5, precomputing up to 5e5 is manageable.

So in code:

mod =998244353

n, k = map(int, input().split())

if k ==0:

   print(0)

elif k==1:

   print(n % mod)

else:

   r =k-1

   max_needed =n-1 # when d=1, t=n//1-1= n-1.

   if r>max_needed:

       print(0)

   else:

       # precompute fact and inv_fact up to max_needed.

       max_fact =max_needed

       fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)

       for i in range(1, max_fact+1):

           fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i %mod

       inv_fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)

       inv_fact[max_fact] = pow(fact[max_fact], mod-2, mod)

       for i in range(max_fact-1, -1, -1):

           inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) %mod

       ans =0

       for d in range(1, n+1):

           t = (n//d) -1

           if t >=r:

               comb = fact[t] * inv_fact[r] % mod

               comb = comb * inv_fact[t -r] % mod

               ans = (ans + comb) % mod

       print(ans)

But wait, when k=1, r=0. So the code would go into the 'else' part and check if r>max_needed. For example, when n=500000 and k=1, r=0. max_needed=500000-1=499999. So 0 <=499999, so proceed.

But then, the code precomputes up to max_needed=499999. Then for each d from 1 to n=5e5:

t = (5e5//d) -1.

We need to compute C(t, 0), which is 1 for any t>=0.

But in this case, t can be (5e5//d) -1. For example, d=1: t=5e5-1. Which is >=0. So comb is C(5e5-1,0) =1.

d=2: (5e5//2)-1 =250000-1=249999. >=0. So add 1.

And so on, for all d from 1 to 5e5. So the sum is 5e5. Which is correct.

But for k=1, the code in the else part would compute this correctly.

But for k=1, the code would go into the else part, compute r=0, and proceed. So the code's handling of k=1 is correct.

But what about when k=0? The problem constraints say 1<=k<=5e5, so k=0 is not possible, but the code has a check for k==0.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's test the code against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

7 3 → k=3 → r=2.

max_needed=7-1=6. r=2<=6. Precompute up to 6.

For d=1: t=7//1 -1=6. C(6,2)=15.

For d=2:7//2=3, t=2. C(2,2)=1. So sum 15+1=16.

Other d's: for d=3, t=(7//3)-1=2-1=1 <2 → no. So sum is 16.

Sample Input 2:

3 7 →k=7, r=6. max_needed=3-1=2. r=6>2 → output 0.

Sample Input 3:

1337 42 → r=41. Compute for all d where t >=41.

t = (1337//d) -1 >=41 → 1337//d >=42 → d <=1337//42 → 1337//42=31. So d can be from 1 to 31. For each d, compute t= (1337//d)-1, then check if t>=41. For example, d=31 → 1337//31=43 → t=42. So t=42 >=41 → C(42,41)=42. Similarly for other d's.

But the actual code will sum all such possibilities.

Sample Input 4:

1 1 →k=1, output is 1.

Sample Input 5:

500000 1 →k=1, output 500000.

Thus, the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, the code needs to handle very large n and k, but the precomputation is O(n), and the loop is O(n). For n=5e5, this is acceptable.

But in Python, even O(n) loops can be slow for 5e5 iterations. However, given the time constraints (2 seconds), and Python's speed, it's possible that 5e5 iterations are manageable. But perhaps there is a way to optimize the loop.

Wait, the loop is for d in 1 to n:

But for certain ranges of d, the value of (n//d) is the same. For example, all d in (n/(m+1), n/m] will have n//d =m. So for m from 1 to sqrt(n), there are ranges where d can be grouped.

But in Python, even with 5e5 iterations, each iteration is O(1), and 5e5 steps would take around 0.5 seconds, which is acceptable.

Thus, the code should pass within the time constraints.

Now, the code also needs to precompute factorial and inverse factorial up to 5e5. For n=5e5, this is manageable.

So the code is correct.

```python
mod = 998244353

n, k = map(int, input().split())

if k == 1:
    print(n % mod)
else:
    r = k - 1
    max_needed = (n // 1) - 1  # maximum possible t is n-1 when d=1
    if r > max_needed:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial up to max_needed
        max_fact = max_needed
        fact = [1] * (max_fact + 1)
        for i in range(1, max_fact + 1):
            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod
        
        inv_fact = [1] * (max_fact + 1)
        inv_fact[max_fact] = pow(fact[max_fact], mod - 2, mod)
        for i in range(max_fact - 1, -1, -1):
            inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod
        
        ans = 0
        for d in range(1, n + 1):
            t = (n // d) - 1
            if t >= r:
                c = fact[t] * inv_fact[r] % mod
                c = c * inv_fact[t - r] % mod
                ans = (ans + c) % mod
        
        print(ans)
