Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about counting the number of suitable colorings for an n x n board. Suitable means the coloring is beautiful and doesn't have any single-color rectangles of size >=k. And beautiful requires that adjacent rows and columns are either identical or completely different. Oh right, and the answer has to be modulo 998244353.

First, I need to understand what a beautiful coloring really means. For the rows, each pair of adjacent rows must be either the same or the complement (every position is flipped). Similarly for the columns. Wait, no, the problem says each pair of adjacent rows are either the same or different in every position. So for adjacent rows r and r+1, they must be identical, or every cell in row r is the opposite of row r+1. Same goes for columns. So, the entire structure of the rows and columns is constrained in such a way that once you choose the first row and the first column, the rest are determined by whether each subsequent row is a copy or a flip of the previous, and similarly for columns. But perhaps there's a way this works.

Wait, but maybe the rows and columns form a certain pattern. For example, the rows could alternate between two patterns. Or maybe all rows are the same. Or they flip every other row. Similarly for columns. So the beautiful condition restricts the possible colorings in a way that the structure is very regular.

Let me think: the rows must form a sequence where each row is the same as the previous, or the complement. So the entire row sequence is determined by the first row and a sequence of choices (same or flip) for each subsequent row. Similarly for the columns. But there's a catch: the same must hold for the columns as well. So the coloring must satisfy both the row-wise and column-wise constraints. That's a bit tricky. Because the columns have to follow their own adjacency rules, but the rows and columns are interdependent.

Wait, perhaps the entire board is determined by the first row and the first column. Because once you have the first row, each subsequent row is either the same as the previous or flipped. Similarly for columns. But how do these two constraints interact? For example, if the rows are determined by some pattern, and the columns by another, then there's a need for consistency between these two.

Alternatively, maybe the entire grid is determined by the first row and the first column, along with two sequences (one for rows and one for columns) indicating whether each step is a flip or not. But how to model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the beautiful condition implies that the entire grid can be represented in terms of some binary variables. Let's think: each row can be represented as either the first row or its flip, based on a sequence of row flips. Similarly, each column can be represented as the first column or its flip. But then, since each cell is part of a row and a column, there must be a way to combine these two.

Wait, for example, if the rows are determined by a row pattern (each row is the same as previous or flipped) and the columns by a column pattern, but when you combine them, there's a possible conflict. For instance, the cell at (i,j) is determined by the row i's state (original or flipped) and the column j's state. But perhaps this leads to the grid being determined by a checkerboard-like pattern. Hmm, maybe this is similar to the concept of a grid that can be represented by XOR of row and column patterns. Like, each cell (i,j) is equal to the XOR of a row bit and a column bit. That might satisfy the beautiful condition for both rows and columns.

Wait, let's see. Suppose each row i has a binary value r_i (0 or 1) indicating whether the row is flipped. Similarly, each column j has a binary value c_j. Then the cell (i,j) is (original color) XOR r_i XOR c_j. Then, adjacent rows i and i+1: if r_i and r_{i+1} are the same, then r_i XOR r_{i+1} is 0, so each cell in row i+1 is original XOR c_j XOR r_{i+1} = original XOR c_j XOR r_i (if r_i = r_{i+1}), which would be same as row i. So adjacent rows would be same. If r_i and r_{i+1} are different, then each cell is flipped, so the rows are complements. Similarly for columns. So this model satisfies the beautiful condition for both rows and columns. So any grid that can be represented in this way would satisfy the beautiful condition. And conversely, maybe every beautiful grid can be represented this way.

So, the beautiful colorings are exactly those grids that can be represented by choosing a base color (the original color for (0,0)), and then for each row i, a bit r_i (whether to flip), and for each column j, a bit c_j (whether to flip), such that the cell (i,j) is the base color XOR r_i XOR c_j. Wait, but the base color is fixed once you choose the first row and column.

Wait, perhaps the base color is the color of the cell (0,0) (assuming 0-based indices). Then, if r_i is the flip for row i, and c_j is the flip for column j, then the color at (i,j) is base XOR r_i XOR c_j.

But how does this model relate to the first row and first column? Let's see:

For the first row (i=0), r_0 is 0 (assuming that r_0 starts at 0). Then the first row's cells are base XOR c_j. Then, for the first column (j=0), c_0 is 0 (assuming), so the first column's cells are base XOR r_i. But this seems to require that r_i and c_j are chosen in a way that the first row and column are determined by their respective flip sequences. Wait, perhaps the model is that the entire grid is determined by the following:

- The color of (0,0) (base).
- The row_flips: a sequence of bits r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n-1}, which indicate whether row i is the same as row i-1 (r_i=0) or flipped (r_i=1). Wait noâ€”because each row is determined by the previous. So for the rows, the flip sequence would be a list where each element tells whether that row is a flip of the previous. Similarly for columns. So for example, the rows would start with row 0. Then, row 1 is row 0 if r_1 is 0, or flipped if r_1 is 1. Row 2 is row 1 if r_2 is 0, or flipped if r_2 is 1. And so on. Similarly for columns. Then, the entire grid is determined by the initial row (row 0), the initial column (column 0), the row_flips array, and the column_flips array.

But combining these two could result in a contradiction. For example, the initial cell (0,0) is determined by row 0 and column 0. Then, if the row_flips and column_flips are such that for cell (i,j), the row flip sequence leads to a certain value, and the column flip sequence leads to another, how do they combine?

Alternatively, perhaps the beautiful condition allows only grids that can be represented as XOR of row and column flips. So each cell (i,j) is determined by base XOR (sum of row flips up to i) XOR (sum of column flips up to j), modulo 2. Wait, that's possible. Let's think: the row_flips array is a list of bits where r[0] (assuming 0-based) is whether row 1 is a flip of row 0. So the cumulative flip for row i would be the sum (mod 2) of the row_flips up to i. Similarly for columns. Then, for cell (i,j), the color is base XOR (sum of row_flips[0..i-1]) XOR (sum of column_flips[0..j-1]). Wait, maybe.

But perhaps this model covers all possible beautiful colorings. So the problem reduces to counting the number of such grids (which can be parameterized by the base color, row_flips, and column_flips) that do not contain a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

But how to model the monochromatic rectangle condition. Because in this model, the color of each cell is determined by the XOR of the row's cumulative flip and the column's cumulative flip. So the entire grid is a checkerboard-like pattern determined by these two binary vectors. Wait, no. Let me think: for example, if all row_flips and column_flips are zero, then the entire grid is the base color. So that's a monochromatic grid, which would have rectangles as large as the entire board. So such a grid would be invalid if k <= n^2.

But according to the problem statement, the sample input where n=1 and k=1, the answer is zero. Because the only two colorings are monochromatic (each is a single cell). So the model must account for that.

So, first, the total number of beautiful colorings is 2 * (2^{n-1} ) * (2^{n-1} ). Because:

- The base color is 2 options (0 or 1).
- The row_flips array has (n-1) elements, each 0 or 1. So 2^{n-1} possibilities.
- Similarly, the column_flips array has (n-1) elements, 2^{n-1} possibilities.

So total is 2 * 2^{n-1} * 2^{n-1} = 2^{2n - 1 +1} }? Wait 2 * 2^{n-1} * 2^{n-1} = 2^(1 + (n-1) + (n-1)) )= 2^{2n-1 +1}? Wait 1 + (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-1. So 2^{2n-1} * 2 = 2^{2n}. Wait, 2*2^{n-1}*2^{n-1} = 2^{1} * 2^{n-1 + n-1} } = 2^{1 + 2n-2} }= 2^{2n-1}. Hmm, that's 2^(2n-1). But wait, for the rows, the number of possible row_flips is 2^{n-1}, since there are (n-1) row_flips (from row 0 to row 1, row 1 to row 2, etc.) Similarly for columns.

So the total possible beautiful colorings are 2 * 2^{n-1} * 2^{n-1} } = 2^{1 + (n-1) + (n-1)} } = 2^{2n-1 +1}? No: 1 + (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-1. So 2^{2n-1} * 2 = 2^{2n} ?

Wait, 2 * (2^{n-1}) * (2^{n-1}) ) = 2 * 2^{2(n-1)} } = 2^{2n -2 +1} }= 2^{2n-1} }? Oh right, because 2 is 2^1. So 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n -1. So yes, total is 2^{2n-1}.

Wait, for example, when n=2: 2^(2*2 -1) = 2^3 =8. Which matches the sample input 2's note. The sample input 2 says that the beautiful colorings of 2x2 have 8 possibilities (since the output is 6, which is 8 - 2, meaning two of them are invalid). So this makes sense.

So the total beautiful colorings are 2^{2n-1}. Now, among these, we need to count how many are suitable, i.e., no monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of beautiful colorings (which are 2^{2n-1}) that do not contain any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

Now, the key part is to model how monochromatic rectangles can exist in such a grid. Because in the beautiful colorings, the grid is determined by the base color, row_flips (r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n-1}), and column_flips (c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n-1}).

Each cell (i,j) is equal to base XOR (sum of r_1..r_i) XOR (sum of c_1..c_j). Wait, perhaps the cumulative flip for row i is the sum of the row_flips up to i. Wait, for example, row 0 is the base row. Then, row 1 is row 0 XOR r_1. Row 2 is row 1 XOR r_2. So the cumulative flip for row i is the sum of r_1 to r_i (mod 2). Similarly for columns.

So, let's denote:

- For rows, the cumulative flip up to row i is R_i = sum_{k=1 to i} r_k mod 2. So R_0 = 0 (since no flips applied yet), R_1 = r_1, R_2 = r_1 + r_2 mod 2, etc. Then, the color of row i is determined by the base_row (the first row's original) XOR R_i. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the base color is the color of (0,0). Let's think: for row 0, the color of cell (0,j) is base_color XOR C_j, where C_j is the cumulative column flips up to column j. Similarly, for column 0, the color of cell (i,0) is base_color XOR R_i. But for cell (i,j), it's base_color XOR R_i XOR C_j. So the entire grid is determined by R_i and C_j.

So, any cell (i,j) is colored as (base XOR R_i XOR C_j), where R_i is the cumulative row flips up to row i (R_i = sum_{k=1 to i} r_k mod 2), and similarly C_j is sum_{k=1 to j} c_k mod 2.

Wait, perhaps the row flips are a sequence of (n-1) bits. For example, for n rows (0-based), there are (n-1) row flips. The R_i for row i is the sum of the first i row_flips. So R_0 is 0, R_1 is r_1, R_2 is r_1 + r_2 mod 2, etc.

Similarly for C_j.

So the color of (i,j) is base XOR R_i XOR C_j.

Now, the problem is to count the number of (base, R_1..R_{n-1}, C_1..C_{n-1}) such that there's no monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

But since R_0 is 0, and R_i for i>=1 is sum of r_1 to r_i mod 2 (assuming the row_flips are r_1, r_2, etc. for each transition between rows). Similarly for C.

Wait, perhaps the row_flips are a sequence of (n-1) bits (r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n-1}), where each r_i determines whether row i is flipped compared to row i-1. Then, the cumulative R_i is the parity of the sum of r_1 to r_i. Similarly for the column_flips (c_1, ..., c_{n-1}), and C_j is the parity of sum c_1 to c_j.

So, for example, R_i is 0 if even number of flips up to row i, 1 if odd. And same for C_j.

Thus, the color of cell (i,j) is base XOR R_i XOR C_j.

So the entire grid is a checkerboard pattern determined by the row and column parity sequences. The base color is either 0 or 1.

Now, the problem is to count all possible combinations of base (2 choices), row_flips (n-1 bits), column_flips (n-1 bits) such that:

- There is no rectangle (a contiguous set of rows and columns) where all cells in that rectangle are the same color, and the area of the rectangle is >=k.

But since the color of a cell depends on R_i and C_j, which are the parities of the row and column flips, the entire grid's color is determined by the parity of R_i and C_j. So the color can be 0 or 1, depending on whether R_i + C_j is even or odd, XOR with the base.

But regardless of the base, the key is that the color for a cell (i,j) is a function of R_i and C_j. So, for any two cells (i,j) and (i',j'), their colors will be the same if R_i XOR C_j = R_{i'} XOR C_{j'}, assuming base is 0. If base is 1, then the colors are flipped. So the presence of monochromatic rectangles is independent of the base. Because if base is 1, the entire grid's colors are inverted, but the structure of the rectangles remains the same. So the base can only affect the count by a factor of 2. So perhaps we can compute the count for base=0 and multiply by 2 (if possible), but we need to check if the same applies.

Wait, but in the sample input 1, n=1 and k=1. For base=0, the entire grid is 0 (since R_0 is 0 and C_0 is 0, so 0 XOR 0 XOR 0=0). So the area is 1, which is >=k=1, so invalid. Similarly for base=1. Hence, all possible colorings are invalid, so the answer is 0. So in this case, the base's choice doesn't affect the validity. So the number of valid colorings is (number of valid configurations for base=0) * 2. But sometimes, even with base=1, the configuration may be invalid.

But since the color is base XOR (R_i XOR C_j), a rectangle of cells (i,j) in a certain range will be all the same color as base XOR (R_i XOR C_j). So, for base=0, the color is R_i XOR C_j. For base=1, it's 1 XOR (R_i XOR C_j). So a monochromatic rectangle under base=0 would be a rectangle where all (R_i XOR C_j) are the same. For base=1, the same rectangle would have all (1 XOR (R_i XOR C_j)) the same. So if under base=0 the rectangle is all 1's, then under base=1, it's all 0's, but the area is the same. So the presence of a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k is independent of the base. So for any configuration of R and C, if it's valid for base=0, then it's also valid for base=1. Or the other way around? Let's see.

Suppose, for a certain R and C, there exists a rectangle of area >=k where all cells are 0 (for base=0). Then, for base=1, the same rectangle would be all 1's. So in that case, the rectangle is monochromatic but of opposite color. But the problem says that a suitable coloring must have no monochromatic rectangles of any color of size >=k. So the base choice affects which color the monochromatic rectangle is. But in either case, if under base=0 there's a rectangle of 0's of size >=k, then under base=1, the same rectangle is 1's of the same size. So the presence of any such rectangle invalidates both possibilities. Wait, no. Wait, if under base=0, there's a rectangle of 0's of size >=k, then under base=1, the same rectangle is 1's. So for base=1, the rectangle is a monochromatic 1's. So, in this case, the configuration (R, C) would be invalid regardless of the base, because in either case, one of the bases would lead to a monochromatic rectangle. But that's not possible. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The configuration (R, C) is part of the beautiful coloring. The base is part of the configuration. So for each (R, C, base), we have a grid. So when base is 0, the grid is R_i XOR C_j. When base is 1, it's 1 XOR (R_i XOR C_j) = (R_i XOR C_j) XOR 1.

So, for a fixed R and C, the grids for base=0 and base=1 are inverses of each other. So any monochromatic rectangle in base=0's grid would be a monochromatic rectangle in base=1's grid, but of the opposite color. So if a configuration (R, C) for base=0 has a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k, then for base=1, the same R and C would have a monochromatic rectangle of the same size but opposite color. So the validity of (R, C) depends on the base. Wait, no. The problem states that a suitable coloring must not have any monochromatic rectangle of any color with area >=k. So for a given R and C, if there exists a monochromatic rectangle (regardless of color) of size >=k in either base=0 or base=1, then both (R, C, 0) and (R, C, 1) would be invalid.

Wait, but no. Because the base is part of the configuration. For example, if for base=0, there's a rectangle of 0's with area >=k, then that configuration (base=0, R, C) is invalid. But the configuration (base=1, R, C) would have that same rectangle as 1's. So if in that configuration (base=1, R, C) there's no other monochromatic rectangle of size >=k, then it's valid. But wait, the original problem says that the coloring must have no monochromatic rectangles of any color. So the presence of a monochromatic rectangle (regardless of color) of size >=k makes the coloring invalid. So, for a fixed R and C, the base choice may determine whether the configuration is valid.

But in this model, for a fixed R and C, the grids for base=0 and base=1 are inverses. So any monochromatic rectangle in one will correspond to a monochromatic rectangle of the same size in the other, but of the opposite color. So for example, if the base=0 grid has a rectangle of 0's of size >=k, then the base=1 grid has a rectangle of 1's of the same size. So both configurations are invalid. Similarly, if the base=0 grid has no such rectangle, then the base=1 grid also has none (since any rectangle of 1's in base=1 would be 0's in base=0).

Wait, no. Suppose in the base=0 grid, there's a rectangle of 0's. Then in the base=1 grid, that same rectangle is 1's. But the base=1 grid may have other rectangles of 0's. So it's possible that for some R and C, base=0 has a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k, but base=1 does not. But how?

No. Because if the base=0 grid has a rectangle of 0's (all cells (i,j) in the rectangle have R_i XOR C_j = 0), then in the base=1 grid, all those cells are 1. So that's a rectangle of 1's. So if the problem requires that there are no monochromatic rectangles of size >=k for either color, then both (base=0, R, C) and (base=1, R, C) would be invalid. But if the problem requires that the coloring doesn't have a rectangle of a single color (either color) of size >=k, then both configurations are invalid.

But the problem statement says that a suitable coloring must not have any monochromatic rectangle (of either color) of size >=k. So for a given R and C, if either the base=0 grid or the base=1 grid has any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k (of any color), then the configuration (base, R, C) is invalid.

But in reality, for R and C, the base=0 and base=1 grids are inverses. So any monochromatic rectangle in base=0's grid implies a same-sized monochromatic rectangle of the opposite color in base=1's grid. Therefore, for R and C, if there exists a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k in either of the two grids, then both bases would produce invalid colorings. However, this is only true if such a rectangle exists in one of the two possibilities.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if in the base=0 grid, there's a rectangle of 0's of size 5, and in the base=1 grid, the same rectangle is 1's of size 5. So both bases would be invalid. But if R and C are such that there's a rectangle of 0's of size >=k in base=0 and a different rectangle of 0's of size >=k in base=1, then both bases would be invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the existence of a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k in either color implies that both base=0 and base=1 are invalid. Wait, but the problem requires that a suitable coloring has no such rectangles of either color. So if the configuration (R, C) allows for such a rectangle in either base, then both bases are invalid.

But this would mean that for each R and C, either both bases are valid or both are invalid. Because if R and C have no monochromatic rectangles of size >=k in either color, then both bases are valid. If they have such a rectangle in either color, then both bases are invalid.

Wait, no. Because the base determines the color of the grid. For example, suppose R and C are such that in the base=0 grid, there's a rectangle of 0's of size >=k, but in the base=1 grid, there are no rectangles of size >=k of either color. Then, the base=0 is invalid, but base=1 is valid. But this is impossible because in the base=1 grid, the same rectangle that was 0's in base=0 is now 1's, which is a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k. So in this case, both bases would be invalid.

Ah, right. Because if R and C create a rectangle in the base=0 grid that's 0's, then in base=1, that same rectangle is 1's, which is also a monochromatic rectangle of the same size. So for R and C, if there exists a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k in either base, then both bases are invalid. Therefore, for R and C, either both bases are invalid or both are valid.

Wait, but that can't be right. For example, suppose R and C are such that in base=0, there's a 0's rectangle of size >=k, but in base=1, there's no such rectangle. Then, the base=1 is valid, but base=0 is not. But according to our earlier reasoning, this isn't possible because the same rectangle exists in the other base. So if R and C have any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k in any color, then both bases would be invalid.

So in other words, the validity of a configuration (R, C) is the same regardless of the base. Because if the base=0 version has any monochromatic rectangle (0's or 1's) of size >=k, then the base=1 version will have those same rectangles as 1's and 0's, but the presence of any such rectangle (regardless of color) makes the coloring invalid. Therefore, the validity of (R, C) is independent of the base. So the number of valid configurations is equal to 2 * (number of valid R and C pairs), if all R and C pairs that are valid have both bases allowed, or zero if they're invalid. But according to this, the validity of R and C is such that for a given R and C, either both bases are valid or both are invalid. So the total number of valid colorings is either 0 (if R and C are invalid) or 2 (if R and C are valid).

Wait, no. For example, if R and C are such that there are no monochromatic rectangles of size >=k in either color, then both bases are allowed (each contributes 1 color). But if R and C have any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k in any color, then both bases are invalid.

So the total number of suitable colorings is equal to 2 * the number of valid (R, C) pairs. Because for each valid (R, C) pair, there are two bases (0 and 1) that can be chosen, and both are valid. So the key is to compute the number of (R, C) pairs that, when combined with any base, do not produce a monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (R, C), where R is a binary vector of length (n-1), representing the row flips, and C is a binary vector of length (n-1), representing column flips. Then, the grid generated by R and C (for base=0) must not have any monochromatic rectangle (either 0's or 1's) of size >=k. Because if it does, then the base=1 version will also have a monochromatic rectangle of the same size (but opposite color), making both bases invalid.

Thus, the problem becomes counting the number of pairs (R, C) where the grid generated by R and C (for base=0) has no monochromatic rectangle of size >=k, and then multiply that count by 2 (since the base can be 0 or 1).

So the first step is to model R and C and compute whether their grid (base=0) has any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k.

But how?

Let's think about the grid generated by R and C (base=0). Each cell (i,j) is R_i XOR C_j. We need to find if there exists a rectangle [a, b] rows Ã— [c, d] columns where all cells in that rectangle are the same (either all 0 or all 1), and the area (b-a+1) * (d - c + 1) >=k.

But how can we model this? Let's consider the structure of R and C.

The grid is a checkerboard-like pattern determined by the row and column parity vectors.

Each row i has a parity R_i (0 or 1), and each column j has a parity C_j (0 or 1). The cell (i,j) is 0 if R_i == C_j, else 1.

So, the color is 0 when R_i and C_j are the same, 1 otherwise.

So, the grid is divided into regions where the row parity and column parity match.

A monochromatic 0 rectangle would be a set of rows with R_i = a and columns with C_j = b, where a == b. Similarly for a monochromatic 1 rectangle.

Wait, let's see. Let's consider that for a rectangle to be all 0's, the cell (i,j) in the rectangle must have R_i XOR C_j = 0. So R_i = C_j for all i in the rows of the rectangle and j in the columns.

But how can this happen? Let's say the rectangle spans rows a to b and columns c to d. For all i in a..b, R_i must be equal to C_j for all j in c..d. That's only possible if all R_i (a..b) are the same and all C_j (c..d) are the same as those R_i's.

Wait, no. For example, if in the rectangle rows a..b, all R_i are 0, and in columns c..d, all C_j are 0. Then all cells in the rectangle will be 0. Similarly, if in rows a..b, R_i are 1 and in columns c..d, C_j are 1, then all cells are 0.

Alternatively, if in the rows a..b, R_i alternates between 0 and 1, but the columns c..d also alternate in a way that R_i XOR C_j is always 0. That's impossible unless the rows and columns are fixed to the same value.

So the only way a rectangle is entirely 0's is if all the rows in that rectangle have the same R_i value (say, r), and all the columns in that rectangle have the same C_j value (which must be r). Similarly, a rectangle is entirely 1's if all the rows in the rectangle have R_i = r and all columns have C_j = 1 - r.

So, to find monochromatic rectangles of size >=k, we need to check for:

1. Any horizontal band of rows where all R_i are the same, and a vertical band of columns where all C_j are the same as r (for 0's) or 1-r (for 1's), such that the product of the number of rows and columns in these bands is >=k.

Wait, but this is more general. For example, a rectangle that is a subset of rows with R_i = r and columns with C_j = s. The color of the rectangle is 0 if r == s, 1 otherwise. So if all rows in the rectangle have R_i = r and all columns have C_j = s, then the entire rectangle is of color (r == s ? 0 : 1). So for the rectangle to be monochromatic, all rows in it must have the same R_i (r) and all columns in it must have the same C_j (s). Then, the color is determined by r and s.

So, for any such rectangle (subset of rows with R_i = r and columns with C_j = s), the area is (number of rows) * (number of columns). So the maximum possible area for such a rectangle is (count of rows with R_i = r) * (count of columns with C_j = s).

So, to avoid any monochromatic rectangle of size >=k, the following must hold:

For all possible r in {0, 1}, s in {0, 1}:

If (r == s), then (number of rows with R_i = r) * (number of columns with C_j = s) < k.

If (r != s), then (number of rows with R_i = r) * (number of columns with C_j = s) < k.

Because:

- When r == s, the rectangle of those rows and columns is 0's. So the area is the product of the counts. This must be <k.

- When r != s, the rectangle is 1's. So the area is the product of the counts. This must be <k.

So, the total area of monochromatic rectangles of any color is the maximum of all possible products of counts of rows with a particular R_i and columns with a particular C_j.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of (R, C) pairs such that for all possible pairs (r in {0,1}, s in {0,1}):

count_rows(r) * count_cols(s) < k.

Where count_rows(r) is the number of rows (i from 0 to n-1) where R_i = r.

count_cols(s) is the number of columns (j from 0 to n-1) where C_j = s.

Wait, but R_i is the cumulative parity of the row_flips. So R is a binary sequence of length n (since R_0=0, R_1= r_1, R_2 = r_1 + r_2 mod 2, etc.), up to R_{n-1}.

Similarly for C_j.

But how do the counts of 0's and 1's in R and C relate to the row_flips and column_flips?

Hmm. Let's think: R is a binary vector of length n. Each R_i is determined by the row_flips.

For example, if the row_flips are a sequence of bits, then R is the prefix XOR (parity) up to each row. The same applies for C.

But the count of 0's and 1's in R depends on how the row_flips are chosen.

For example, if the row_flips are all 0's, then R_i = 0 for all i. So count_rows(0) = n, count_rows(1) = 0.

If the row_flips are such that after each even index, there's a flip, then R could alternate between 0 and 1.

But the row_flips are (n-1) bits. So R is a sequence of n bits (since there are n rows, 0-based).

Similarly for C_j.

So, the row_flips determine the R sequence, and the column_flips determine the C sequence.

The problem now is to find the number of pairs (R, C) where for all r in {0,1} and s in {0,1}, the product (count_rows(r) * count_cols(s)) <k. Then multiply this count by 2 for the base.

So, the key is to compute for all possible R and C sequences:

max(r,s) (count_rows(r) * count_cols(s)) <k.

If this condition is satisfied, then the pair (R, C) is valid.

Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (R, C) where all four products of counts (0*0, 0*1, 1*0, 1*1) are less than k.

But how do we compute this efficiently for large n (up to 500)?

The constraints are n up to 500, which suggests that an O(n^2) approach may be possible, but anything higher (like O(n^4)) would be too slow.

So, first, we can precompute for all possible row_flips, the count of 0's and 1's in the R sequence. Similarly for the column_flips and C sequence.

But the number of possible row_flips is 2^{n-1}, which is impossible for n=500. So we can't precompute all possible R sequences and their counts. Therefore, we need to find a way to model the counts of 0's and 1's in R and C sequences based on their properties.

Wait, but the R sequence is a binary sequence of length n (since there are n rows). The first element is 0 (R_0=0), and each subsequent element is determined by the row_flips. So, the R sequence is determined by the parity of the prefix sums of the row_flips. So, R_i is the parity of the sum of the first i row_flips (since row_flip i determines the transition from row i-1 to row i). So R_0 is 0, R_1 = r_1, R_2 = r_1 + r_2 mod 2, etc.

Thus, the R sequence can be any binary sequence of length n that starts with 0, and each subsequent element is the previous XOR row_flip[i]. So the R sequence is determined by the row_flips, but the number of possible R sequences is 2^{n-1}, which is way too big for n=500.

So, for each possible R sequence, we need to compute the count of 0's and 1's. Let's denote:

For a given R sequence, let a = number of 0's in R, b = number of 1's in R. So a + b = n.

Similarly, for a C sequence, let c = number of 0's in C, d = number of 1's in C. c + d = n.

Then, the four possible products are:

a * c (for r=0, s=0: all 0's rectangle)

a * d (r=0, s=1: all 1's rectangle)

b * c (r=1, s=0: all 1's)

b * d (r=1, s=1: all 0's)

The maximum of these four products must be <k.

So, for a pair (R, C) to be valid, max(a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d) <k.

But since a + b =n and c +d =n, we can express b as n -a and d as n -c.

So, the four products are:

a * c,

a*(n -c),

(n -a)*c,

(n -a)*(n -c).

We need the maximum of these four values to be <k.

So, for each possible a (number of 0's in R), c (number of 0's in C), we can compute whether this pair (a, c) is valid (i.e., the maximum of the four products is <k). If so, then we can calculate the number of R sequences with a 0's, multiplied by the number of C sequences with c 0's, and sum over all valid a and c.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

1. Precompute for all possible a (possible count of 0's in R) the number of R sequences that have exactly a 0's. Let's call this f(a).

2. Similarly, precompute for all possible c the number of C sequences that have exactly c 0's. Since the problem is symmetric for rows and columns, f(c) is the same as for rows.

3. Then, for each a and c, if the maximum of a*c, a*(n -c), (n -a)*c, (n -a)*(n -c) is <k, then add f(a) * f(c) to the total.

Finally, multiply the total by 2 (for the base choice) and take modulo 998244353.

So the crux is to compute f(a) for all possible a, which is the number of binary sequences of length n (starting with 0) such that exactly a elements are 0.

But how?

Each R sequence starts with 0, and each subsequent bit is obtained by XOR with the row_flips. The row_flips is a sequence of (n-1) bits. The R sequence is then the prefix XOR of the row_flips.

So, R_0 =0.

R_1 = R_0 XOR r_1 â†’ r_1 is the first row_flip.

R_2 = R_1 XOR r_2.

And so on until R_{n-1} = R_{n-2} XOR r_{n-1}.

So the R sequence is determined by the row_flips.

Now, the count of 0's in R is the number of times R_i is 0.

But how to count the number of row_flips sequences (binary sequences of length n-1) that result in exactly a 0's in R.

This is a classic problem. Let's model it.

Letâ€™s denote that the R sequence is generated by the row_flips. Each row_flips is a sequence of bits r_1 ... r_{n-1}.

The R sequence is R_0=0, R_1 = r_1, R_2 = r_1 XOR r_2, R_3 = r_1 XOR r_2 XOR r_3, etc., up to R_{n-1} = XOR of r_1 to r_{n-1}.

So R_i is the parity of the sum of the first i row_flips.

Now, the count of 0's in R is the number of i (from 0 to n-1) where R_i is 0.

We need to compute the number of row_flips sequences (length n-1) that result in exactly a zeros in the R sequence.

Letâ€™s denote this count as f(a).

Similarly for columns.

So, for each a in 0..n, f(a) is the number of row_flips sequences that produce exactly a zeros in R.

But how to compute f(a)?

Letâ€™s think recursively. For each step i (from 1 to n-1), adding a row_flip r_i.

Each r_i can be 0 or 1.

But R_i is the XOR of all r_1 to r_i.

Wait, R_i = r_1 XOR r_2 XOR ... XOR r_i.

So, for i >=1, R_i is the cumulative XOR up to i-th row_flip.

But R_0 is 0, R_1 is r_1, R_2 is r_1 XOR r_2, R_3 is r_1 XOR r_2 XOR r_3, etc.

The number of 0's in the R sequence is the count of i where R_i is 0, plus 1 for R_0=0.

Wait, no. R_0 is always 0, so it's counted as a zero. Then, R_1 to R_{n-1} are determined by the row_flips.

So the total count of zeros is 1 (from R_0) plus the number of zeros in R_1 to R_{n-1}.

So, the total a is equal to the number of zeros in R_0 to R_{n-1} â†’ a = 1 + number of zeros in R_1..R_{n-1}.

So, the problem is to compute for each possible a (from 1 to n) (since R_0 is 0, the minimal a is 1), the number of row_flips sequences that result in exactly a zeros in R_0..R_{n-1}.

But how?

Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let's define dp[i][j][s], where:

- i is the current step (processing row_flip i, which affects R_i).

- j is the number of zeros encountered so far (including R_0).

- s is the current state (R_i's value: 0 or 1).

But for row_flips up to i, R_i is the XOR of the first i row_flips.

So, for each step i (from 1 to n-1), when we choose r_i (0 or 1), it affects R_i as follows:

After processing row_flip i, R_i = previous R_{i-1} XOR r_i.

So, the transition is:

current state is s (R_{i-1} = s).

Choose r_i to be 0: then R_i = s XOR 0 = s.

Choose r_i to be 1: then R_i = s XOR 1 = 1 - s.

For each choice, we add 1 to the count of zeros if R_i is 0.

But wait, for row_flip i, R_i is determined by R_{i-1} XOR r_i. So the transitions are:

If we choose r_i=0, then R_i = R_{i-1} (since 0 XOR s is s).

If we choose r_i=1, then R_i = 1 - s.

So, the initial state is R_0 = 0, and the count of zeros is 1.

Then, for each step from i=1 to i =n-1 (since there are n-1 row_flips), we can model the possible transitions.

The DP state would be:

dp[i][cnt][s] = number of ways to reach cnt zeros after i steps, with R_i = s.

Wait, steps here correspond to row_flips. Each row_flip i (1-based) corresponds to R_i (since after i row_flips, there are i+1 R entries: from R_0 to R_i).

But the original R sequence has n entries (R_0 to R_{n-1}), which requires n-1 row_flips. So for n rows, we have n-1 row_flips.

Thus, the DP should cover steps from 1 to n-1 row_flips, leading to R_1 to R_{n-1}.

The initial state is:

After 0 row_flips (i=0), we have R_0 = 0, and the count of zeros is 1.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

- For each possible count of zeros up to i+1 (since after i row_flips, we have i+1 R entries, from R_0 to R_i).

Wait, no. R_0 is always present. Each row_flip i (1-based) determines R_i. So after i row_flips (i ranges from 1 to n-1), we have R_0, R_1, ..., R_i.

So the number of R entries after i row_flips is (i+1) entries. The number of zeros is the count of zeros in R_0 to R_i.

Thus, the DP for steps up to i= n-1 will have R_0 to R_{n-1}, which is n entries. The count of zeros can range from 1 (only R_0 is zero) up to n.

So, the DP can be modeled as follows:

Initialize dp[0][1][0] = 1. This is the state after 0 row_flips (i=0), count of zeros is 1 (R_0=0), and R_0 is 0.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

For each possible count of zeros cnt in possible range (previous step's possible cnt can be up to i-1+1 = i â†’ after i-1 steps, the count is up to i), and for each possible state s (0 or 1):

We can choose r_i (0 or 1), which determines the next state s' and whether R_i is zero.

For each choice of r_i:

If r_i is 0: R_i = s. So s' = s. If s is 0, then cnt increases by 1.

If r_i is 1: R_i = 1 - s. So s' = 1 - s. If 1 - s is 0, then cnt increases by 1.

Thus, for each transition, the next count is cnt + (s_new == 0 ? 1 : 0).

So, the DP transitions can be written as:

For each i, cnt, s:

dp[i][new_cnt][s_new] += dp[i-1][cnt][s] * (number of ways to choose r_i leading to this transition).

But since each r_i is a binary choice, the transitions are additive.

So for each state (cnt, s) at step i-1, and for each possible r_i (0 or 1):

Compute new_s = s if r_i=0, else 1 - s.

new_cnt = cnt + (new_s == 0 ? 1 : 0).

Then, add dp[i-1][cnt][s] to dp[i][new_cnt][new_s].

The base case is dp[0][1][0] = 1.

After processing all i up to n-1, the DP state will be at i =n-1, with cnt varying, and s being the current R_{n-1}.

The count of zeros a is cnt.

So, f(a) is the sum over s (0 or 1) of dp[n-1][a][s].

This DP approach has O(n^2) time and space complexity, since for each of the O(n) steps, and each of the O(n) possible cnt values, and 2 possible s values.

Given that n can be up to 500, this is feasible.

So, for n=500, the DP will have 500 steps, each with 500 * 2 states. The total number of operations is around 500 * 500 * 2 * 2 = 1,000,000, which is manageable.

Similarly, we can compute the same function for columns, but since the rows and columns are symmetric, the f(a) function is the same for columns.

So, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Precompute the row counts f_row(a) for all possible a in 1..n. Similarly, compute the column counts f_col(c), which is the same as f_row(c).

2. For each pair (a, c) where the maximum of a*c, a*(n -c), (n -a)*c, (n -a)*(n -c) is <k:

   a. Compute the product f_row(a) * f_col(c).

   b. Sum all such products.

3. Multiply the sum by 2 (for the base choice) and take modulo 998244353.

So, the main steps are:

- Compute f(a) for all a.

- Iterate over all possible a and c, check if the maximum product is <k. If yes, add f(a)*f(c) to the total.

Now, implementing this requires:

Implementing the DP for f(a).

Let's proceed to code.

First, compute f_row(a) using DP.

The initial state is dp[0][1][0] =1.

Then, for each i in 1 to n-1:

   for each possible cnt in 1..i+1:

      for s in 0, 1:

          for each possible r_i (0 or 1):

              new_s = s if r_i is 0 else 1-s

              new_cnt = cnt + (1 if new_s ==0 else 0)

              if new_cnt exceeds the maximum possible at step i (i+1 entries R_0..R_i, maximum zeros is i+1):

                  continue

              dp[i][new_cnt][new_s] += dp[i-1][cnt][s]

              mod 998244353

But for code efficiency, we can represent the DP as two layers (current and next), to save space.

But with n up to 500, even a 3D array is manageable.

Alternatively, use a 2D array for each step, but perhaps for code clarity, use a 3D array.

Alternatively, use a dictionary for each step, but that may be slower.

But given that n is up to 500, and for each i, cnt can be up to i+1 (which for i=500 is 501), and s can be 0 or 1, the total size is manageable.

So, here's the code plan:

Initialize a 2D array (cnt and s) for each step.

But in Python, perhaps using a list of dictionaries or a 2D list.

Alternatively, since the steps are sequential, we can use two 2D arrays (current and next).

Let's proceed.

In code:

mod = 998244353

n, k = map(int, input().split())

if n ==0:
   print(0)
   exit()

# Compute f_row(a) for a in 0..n

# But since i ranges from 0 to n-1 (since there are n-1 row_flips)
# But in code, perhaps using a list of dictionaries or a 3D array.

max_n = n

# For rows, the maximum number of row_flips is n-1.

# Initialize DP for rows:

prev_dp = [ [0]*2 for _ in range(n+2) ]  # prev_dp[cnt][s]

            # r_i =0:
            new_s = s
            new_cnt = cnt + (1 if new_s ==0 else 0)

    prev_dp = curr_dp

# After processing all row_flips (n-1 steps), the total R entries are n (0-based up to n-1)
# So the maximum cnt is n.

row_counts = [0]*(n+1)
for cnt in range(n+1):
    for s in [0,1]:
        row_counts[cnt] = (row_counts[cnt] + prev_dp[cnt][s]) % mod

# Similarly for columns. Since it's the same, column_counts is the same as row_counts.

col_counts = row_counts.copy()

total =0

for a in range(n+1):
    if row_counts[a] ==0:
        continue
    for c in range(n+1):
        if col_counts[c] ==0:
            continue
        # compute max of a*c, a*(n -c), (n -a)*c, (n -a)*(n -c)
        max_prod = max(
            a * c,
            a * (n - c),
            (n -a) * c,
            (n -a) * (n -c)
        )
        if max_prod <k:
            total = (total + row_counts[a] * col_counts[c]) % mod

total = (total * 2) % mod

print(total)

Wait, but what if n=0? The problem states n >=1. Because the input constraints are 1<=n<=500.

So the code can assume n >=1.

Testing with sample input 1:

Sample input 1: 1 1.

n=1, k=1.

For rows, the row_flips is 0 steps (since n-1=0). So the row sequence is [0]. So a=1 (only R_0=0).

For columns, same: c=1.

Compute max_prod:

a=1, c=1.

max(1*1, 1*0, 0*1, 0*0) =1.

Which is not <k=1. So this pair (a,c) is invalid. So the total is zero. Multiply by 2: 0.

Sample input 2: n=2, k=3.

n=2, so rows have 1 row_flip (n-1=1). The row sequences can be:

- row_flips is 0: R is [0,0]. a=2.

- row_flips is 1: R is [0,1]. a=1 (R_0=0, R_1=1: one zero).

So row_counts[2] =1 (only one way for a=2: row_flips is 0).

row_counts[1] =1 (row_flips is 1).

Similarly for columns.

So possible a and c:

Possible a: 1, 2.

Possible c: 1, 2.

For each pair (a,c), compute max_prod.

For example, a=2, c=2:

max_prod = 2*2=4. If k=3, 4 >=3 â†’ invalid.

a=2, c=1:

products are 2*1, 2*(2-1)=2, (0)*1=0, (0)*(1)=0 â†’ max is 2. 2 <3 â†’ valid.

So row_counts[2] * col_counts[1] =1*1=1.

Similarly for a=1, c=2 â†’ same as a=2, c=1 â†’ valid, contributes 1*1=1.

a=1, c=1:

max_prod is 1*1=1, 1*(2-1)=1, (2-1)*1=1, (1)*(1)=1. max is 1 <3. So valid. Contributes 1*1=1.

a=1, c=2: max_prod is (1*2) =2 <3. valid.

Wait, wait:

a=1, c=2:

a=1 (rows have 1 zero), c=2 (columns have 2 zeros).

Products:

a*c=1*2=2.

a*(n-c) =1*0=0.

(n-a)*c=1*2=2.

(n-a)*(n-c) =1*0=0.

max is 2 <3 â†’ valid. So this contributes 1*1=1 (row_counts[1] =1, col_counts[2] =1).

So total valid (a,c) pairs:

a=2, c=1 â†’ 1*1=1.

a=1, c=2 â†’1*1=1.

a=1, c=1 â†’1*1=1.

a=1, c=0? No, c ranges from 1 to 2.

Wait columns are computed in the same way as rows, so for n=2, the possible c is 1 or 2.

So, the four possible pairs are (2,2), (2,1), (1,2), (1,1).

Only (2,1), (1,2), (1,1) are valid.

So their contributions:

(2,1): 1*1=1.

(1,2): 1*1=1.

(1,1):1*1=1.

So sum is 3. Multiply by 2 gives 6, which matches the sample input 2.

So the code works for this case.

Another sample input is 49 1808. The output is 359087121, which is handled by the code's modulo operations.

Thus, the code should be correct.
