Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the problem is about simulating a queue of children where each time a child is treated, there are some effects on the remaining queue. Then, after that, there might be some children leaving the queue because their confidence drops below zero, which in turn affects others. And we have to track the order in which children are treated.

First, let's understand the process step by step. The main steps are:

1. The first child in the queue goes to the doctor. Add their number to the result list.
2. When the doctor treats them, their crying (v_i) affects the first few children in the queue. Specifically, the first child in the line after them loses v_i, the next v_i-1, then v_i-2, etc., until it's 1. So for each k-th child (starting from the next one), the confidence decreases by (v_i - (k-1)), but only as long as (v_i - (k-1)) is positive. So for example, if v_i is 4, the next four children (positions 2,3,4,5) get reduced by 4,3,2,1 respectively. If there are fewer children, then only those get reduced. Like if there are 3 children after, they get 4,3,2 subtracted.
3. After this, any children whose confidence is now negative will cry and leave the queue. But leaving the queue is a chain reaction. So when a child j leaves, all children after them get their confidence reduced by d_j. This can cause more children to leave. And this process happens immediately and completely before the next child is treated.

So the challenge is to model this efficiently, especially given the constraints (n up to 4000). Because if we naively simulate each step, it could be O(n^2) or worse, which might be acceptable for 4000, but maybe not. Let's think about how to optimize this.

Let's break down the steps and see what data structures we can use.

First, the queue of children. Each time the first child is treated, they are removed from the queue. So perhaps a deque or a list would work here, but when we process the queue, we need to handle the v_i effect first, then handle the chain reaction of children leaving due to negative p.

But for the chain reaction part, whenever a child leaves (due to p < 0), all the children after them in the queue have their p reduced by d_j. This can trigger more children to leave. So the order here is important: we need to process all possible children leaving after each treatment step.

The problem is simulating this process efficiently. Let's think about how to model the queue.

An initial approach is to represent the queue as a list, and after each treatment, apply the v_i effect, then check each child in order for p < 0. However, each time a child leaves, all children after them have their p reduced by d_j, which can cause more children to leave. So this is a cascading effect that needs to be processed.

But doing this for each possible child in the queue could be O(n^2) in the worst case. For n=4000, that's 16 million operations, which might be manageable, but perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each child, we can track their current p and whether they are active. But when a child is removed, we need to process the children after them.

Wait, but the chain reaction is such that when a child j (position k in the queue) leaves, all children after position k in the queue have their p reduced by d_j. This can cause some of them to now have p <0, which would then cause their own d reductions. So this is a process that must be handled in a way that any child who's p becomes negative (after any step) is immediately processed (i.e., leaves the queue and triggers their own d reduction on the remaining children after them).

This seems similar to a BFS approach where when a child leaves, we scan the remaining queue for any children whose p is now negative, and process them in the order they appear. But how to model this efficiently.

Let me think: after applying the v_i effect, we need to process the queue and find any child whose p is <0. For those children, when they leave, their d_j is subtracted from all children after them. So perhaps the order of processing is important. For example, if two children are in positions 2 and 3 in the queue. If after the v_i effect, both have p <0, then the one in position 2 is processed first. When it leaves, the child in position 3 (now in position 2 of the remaining queue) has their p reduced by d_j of the first child. If that makes their p <0, then they leave, and their d is applied to the remaining children, etc.

So the correct approach is to process the children in the queue in order, checking if their p is <0. If so, remove them, subtract their d from all subsequent children, and continue checking from the start of the queue again? Or maybe from the next child?

Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose after the v_i effect, the queue is [child A, child B, child C, ...]. We check each child in order. When we find a child (say A) whose p is <0, we remove it, add their d to a cumulative sum, then continue checking the remaining children. Because when A leaves, all children after A (B, C, etc.) have their p reduced by d_A. So for each of them, their current p is p - d_A. Then, after that, any of them that are now <0 would leave, and their d would be subtracted from the subsequent children, and so on.

So this suggests that we can model the d reductions as a cumulative value. Wait, perhaps for each child in the queue, we can track their initial p, and then track the cumulative d that has been subtracted from them due to children leaving before them in the chain.

Alternatively, for each child, the actual p is their original p minus the sum of all d's of children who left before them in the same chain reaction.

But how to compute this efficiently.

For example, during the chain reaction phase, whenever a child leaves, we need to subtract their d from all children after them. But subtracting d from each subsequent child can be time-consuming if done naively (O(n) per subtraction). For n=4000, and in the worst case, each child leaves and we subtract d for each, leading to O(n^2) operations.

This would be O(4000^2) = 16 million operations per test case, which might be acceptable. But maybe we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, we can track for each child a "delta" value that represents the sum of all d's that have been subtracted from them. Then, when a child j is processed (leaves), we can add d_j to a running total for the current chain reaction. Then, for each subsequent child, their effective p is original_p - delta - current_chain_delta.

But how to manage this.

Another idea: during the chain reaction processing, we can iterate through the queue, and for each child, compute their current effective p. If it's negative, process them, and add their d to a cumulative delta. Then, for the next children, their effective p is original_p minus the cumulative delta. So, instead of updating each child's p, we just track the cumulative delta.

Wait, this seems promising. Let's think:

Suppose during the chain reaction processing (after the v_i effect), we have a list of children in the queue. Each child has an initial p. We can track a variable 'current_delta' which is 0 initially. Then, as we iterate through the queue:

For each child in order:

effective_p = p - current_delta

if effective_p < 0:

   add this child to a list to be removed.

   add their d to current_delta.

But wait, the d of this child affects all children after them. So when we process this child, their d is added to current_delta. Then, for all subsequent children, their effective_p is p - current_delta (which includes all previous d's, including the latest one).

But this way, when processing the children in order, we can track the current_delta and compute the effective_p on the fly, without modifying the actual p of the children. Only those children whose effective_p <0 are removed, and their d contributes to the current_delta for the next children.

But after processing all children, the ones that remain in the queue would have their original p minus the sum of all d's from the children that were removed before them in this chain reaction.

So during this processing, we can collect all the children to remove, and then after processing all, we can remove them from the queue. But how to handle this.

Wait, but during the processing, the order is important. For example, suppose after the v_i effect, the queue is [A, B, C, D], and their p's are 1, -3, -2, 5. Then current_delta starts at 0.

Processing A: effective_p = 1 -0 >=0. Not removed.

Processing B: effective_p = -3 -0 = -3 <0. So removed. current_delta += d_B. Then, for C, effective_p is original_p - current_delta (which is d_B). Then D's is original_p - current_delta (d_B). But after B is removed, C and D are now next in line. Suppose d_B is 5. Then for C, effective_p is (-2) -5 = -7. So C is removed, current_delta += d_C. Then D's effective_p is 5 - (5 + d_C). If d_C is 3, then 5 -8 = -3 <0. So D is removed, etc.

So the approach would be:

- Iterate through the current queue, track a current_delta (starts at 0).

- For each child in the queue:

   compute effective_p = child.p - current_delta.

   if effective_p <0:

      mark child to be removed.

      current_delta += child.d

   else:

      child's new p (if they remain) would be effective_p (since current_delta has been accounted for).

Wait, but how do we track the actual p values for the remaining children. Because after the chain reaction, the remaining children's p would be original_p minus the sum of all d's from the children that were removed before them in the chain reaction.

So if a child is not removed during the chain reaction, their effective p is p_initial - sum_d_removed_so_far. But after the chain reaction, their p_initial is adjusted to be p_initial - sum_d_removed_so_far. Because the chain reaction is a single event, and all the d's from the removed children are applied to the remaining ones.

Wait, no. Because when a child is removed, their d is applied to all children after them. So if during the chain reaction processing, we remove children in positions i1, i2, etc., then the remaining children are those that are not removed, and their p's are adjusted by the sum of d's of all removed children that were before them in the queue.

So for example, if during the chain reaction, children at positions 2,4,5 are removed, then each remaining child's p is adjusted by the sum of d's of children removed before them. So the first child (not removed) has their p adjusted by the sum of d's of children before them (like if child 2 was removed, then the first child's p isn't affected, since they are before child 2). Wait, no. The d of a removed child j affects all children that come after j in the queue. So if in the original queue, child j is at position k, then all children after k (positions k+1, k+2, etc.) have their p reduced by d_j.

So the order in which the children are processed and removed affects the sum.

But during the chain reaction processing, the children are processed in the order they are in the queue. So for example, in the initial queue [A, B, C, D], when we process B (removed), then C and D are after B, so their p is reduced by B's d. Then processing C (if removed), then D's p is reduced by C's d, etc.

So in the approach where we track the current_delta as the sum of d's of all removed children that are before the current child in the queue, then the effective_p is the original p minus current_delta. So when processing each child in order:

- For child i in the queue (original order before any removal):

   effective_p = original_p[i] - current_delta.

   if effective_p <0:

      remove child i.

      current_delta += d[i].

   else:

      leave in queue, and their new p is effective_p.

So after this processing, the remaining children's p is original_p minus the sum of all d's of the children that were removed before them in the queue.

Therefore, in code:

We can process each child in the queue in order. For each child, compute effective_p as their original p minus current_delta. If it's negative, we add their d to current_delta and mark them as removed. The remaining children will have their p updated to effective_p (original p minus current_delta at the time of processing). But since some children are removed, the order of processing is the original queue order, and the current_delta accumulates as we go.

So, the steps would be:

1. Collect the initial queue (children in order).

2. For each treatment step:

   a. Take the first child, add to result list.

   b. Apply the v_i effect to the remaining children (if any).

   c. Then process the chain reaction to remove children with p <0, applying d's to subsequent children.

   d. The remaining children form the new queue.

So the key parts are steps 2b and 2c.

Let's think about step 2b: applying the v_i effect.

The v_i is the volume of the treated child. The first child after the treated one (index 0 in the remaining queue) is reduced by v_i. The next by v_i-1, etc. So for the remaining children after the treated one (the queue after popping the first element), each child j (starting from index 0) gets p[j] -= (v_i - j), but only if (v_i -j) >0. Wait, no. The first child (the next one) is reduced by v_i. Then the next by v_i-1, then v_i-2, etc., until the reduction is 1. So for each child in the queue after the treated one, the reduction is max(0, v_i - k + 1), where k is the index (starting from 0). Wait, no. Let's think: after the treated child is removed, the queue is Q = [child_2, child_3, ..., child_n]. For each child in Q, the first (child_2) is at position 0, next (child_3) at position 1, etc. The reduction for child at position k is (v_i - k), but only if (v_i -k) >0. Otherwise, no reduction.

Wait, the problem statement says:

When the i-th child is treated, the first child in the line is reduced by v_i, the second by v_i-1, etc. So for the first child after i-th, subtract v_i. The second subtract v_i-1, third v_i-2, etc., until the value to subtract is 1. So the number of children affected is up to v_i. For example, if v_i is 5, then the first 5 children in the queue after the treated one are each reduced by 5,4,3,2,1. If the queue has fewer than 5 children, then all are reduced as per the formula.

So, for each child in the queue (after treated child is removed), the reduction is (v_i - (position in the queue)), but only if (v_i - position) >0. Position starts at 0.

Wait, no. Because for the first child in the remaining queue (the next one after the treated child), their reduction is v_i. Then the second in line is reduced by v_i-1, third by v_i-2, etc. So for the k-th child (0-based index), the reduction is (v_i -k) if v_i -k >0. So the maximum number of children affected is v_i, but if the queue is shorter, then all are processed. For each such child in the queue, their p is reduced by (v_i - k), where k is their index in the remaining queue.

So to compute this, after removing the treated child, for each k in 0, 1, ..., min(v_i-1, len(queue)-1):

   queue[k].p -= (v_i -k)

Wait, but for k >=v_i, the value (v_i -k) would be <=0, so no reduction. So the maximum k is min(v_i, len(queue)) -1. Because for k up to v_i -1, (v_i -k) is positive.

So for example, if v_i is 4, then k can be 0,1,2,3 (v_i-1 is 3). So the first four children in the queue after the treated child (if available) get their p reduced by 4,3,2,1.

So the code for step 2b would be:

After removing the treated child, for the remaining queue:

for k in range(len(queue)):

    reduction = v_i -k

    if reduction <=0:

        break

    queue[k].p -= reduction

But since len(queue) can be up to 4000, and v_i can be up to 1e6, but the loop would only run up to min(v_i, len(queue)) steps. For v_i up to 1e6, but len(queue) up to 4000, the loop will run up to 4000 steps, which is manageable.

So that's O(4000) per treatment step.

Now step 2c is the chain reaction processing.

The way to process the queue after applying the v_i effect and the chain reaction:

We need to process the queue to find all children that have p <0, considering any d's from prior children leaving.

So the approach is:

- current_delta = 0

- create a new list for the remaining children.

- for each child in the queue (after step 2b):

   effective_p = child.p - current_delta

   if effective_p <0:

       current_delta += child.d

       # do not add to the new list

   else:

       # add to new list, but their p is now effective_p (since current_delta is applied)

       child.p = effective_p

       new_list.append(child)

- set queue = new_list

But wait, this approach would process each child in the original queue (after step 2b) in order, tracking current_delta. If a child's effective_p is <0, they are removed, and their d is added to current_delta. The remaining children (those not removed) have their p adjusted to effective_p (original p - current_delta up to their position). Because the current_delta for subsequent children is cumulative.

This seems correct. Because when a child is removed, all subsequent children have their p reduced by the d of the removed child. So by tracking current_delta, we can compute the effective_p for each subsequent child as original_p minus the sum of all previous d's.

But the problem is that the actual p of the remaining children must be adjusted. Because if a child is not removed, their new p is their original p (after step 2b) minus the sum of d's of all removed children that were before them in the queue.

So by updating their p to effective_p, which is original_p (after step 2b) minus current_delta (sum of d's up to the current point), we correctly reflect the effect of all prior d reductions.

Yes, this approach would work.

But how to implement this. Let's see.

For example:

Original queue after step 2b: [A(p=5), B(p=3), C(p=10), D(p=1)]

Then, during chain reaction processing:

current_delta starts at 0.

Process A: effective_p =5-0=5 >=0. Add to new list, p becomes 5.

Process B: effective_p=3-0=3 >=0. Add to new list, p becomes3.

Process C: 10-0=10 >=0. Add to new list, p=10.

Process D:1-0=1 >=0. Add to new list, p=1. So queue remains same.

Another example:

After step 2b, queue is [A(p=-2, d=3), B(p=5, d=1), C(p=-1, d=4)].

Processing:

current_delta=0.

A: effective_p =-2 -0 =-2 <0. So not added to new list. current_delta=3.

B's effective_p=5 -3=2 >=0. Add to new list, p=2.

C's effective_p= -1 -3= -4 <0. So not added. current_delta=3+4=7.

So new list is [B(p=2)].

So in this case, after processing, B's p is 5-3=2.

So this approach works.

So the code for step 2c would be:

current_delta = 0

new_queue = []

for child in queue_after_step_2b:

    effective_p = child.p - current_delta

    if effective_p <0:

        current_delta += child.d

    else:

        child.p = effective_p

        new_queue.append(child)

queue = new_queue

This is O(n) per chain reaction processing, which is acceptable.

Putting this all together:

We can model the queue as a list, where each element has v, d, p, and the original index (number). Because when the queue is processed, we need to know the original numbers of the children to output in the result.

So each child in the queue is represented as a tuple or a class with attributes v, d, p, and index.

But in Python, using a list of dictionaries or a list of objects may be manageable. However, for speed, perhaps using a list of tuples (v, d, p, index) would be better.

So the steps are:

Initialize the queue with all children, in order.

result = []

while the queue is not empty:

   treated_child = queue.pop(0)

   result.append(treated_child's index)

   # apply v effect to the remaining queue

   v = treated_child.v

   for k in range(len(queue)):

       reduction = v -k

       if reduction <=0:

           break

       queue[k] = (queue[k][0], queue[k][1], queue[k][2] - reduction, queue[k][3])

   # process chain reaction

   current_delta = 0

   new_queue = []

   for child in queue:

       effective_p = child[2] - current_delta

       if effective_p <0:

           current_delta += child[1]

       else:

           new_p = effective_p

           new_queue.append( (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3]) )

   queue = new_queue

Repeat until queue is empty.

Wait, but in Python, tuples are immutable, so modifying the p would require creating new tuples each time. So for the v effect:

When we process the remaining queue after treating a child, we need to loop through the first min(v, len(queue)) children and subtract (v -k) from their p. But since tuples are immutable, we need to create new tuples. So for each index k in the queue:

queue[k] = (v_i, d_i, p_i - reduction, index_i)

But this is feasible.

But for n=4000, and each step having O(4000) operations for the v effect, and O(n) for the chain reaction, the total time would be O(n^2) steps. For n=4000, 4000^2=16 million steps. Which should be acceptable within 1 second.

But wait, each treatment step involves:

- Popping the first element (O(1) for a list, but popping from the front is O(n) for a list). Wait, in Python, popping from index 0 of a list is O(n) time because the list has to shift all elements. So for 4000 steps, that's O(4000 * 4000) = 16 million operations. That might be acceptable, but for n=4000, 16 million is manageable.

Alternatively, using a deque for the queue. Deques allow O(1) appends and pops from both ends. But for the queue, after step 2b and 2c, the queue is modified into a new list each time. So maybe a deque is not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using a list and popping from the front each time, even if it's O(n) time. For n=4000, 4000 pops from the front would be O(4000^2) time. Which may be acceptable, but perhaps better to use a deque for the initial queue.

Wait, the initial queue is built once, and then modified each time. Let's think:

In the code:

Initially, the queue is a list of children, each represented as a tuple (v, d, p, index).

In each treatment step:

1. Treated child is the first element. We remove it (O(n) for a list, O(1) for deque).

2. Apply v effect to the remaining elements (which is a list or deque, but in the code above, when we do for k in range(len(queue)), it's O(v) steps, but after the treated child is removed, the remaining queue is a list. So using a deque here would require converting to a list for the k-based processing. So perhaps it's easier to use a list for the queue.

But for n=4000, popping from the front 4000 times would take O(n^2) time, which is 16 million operations. But in Python, list.pop(0) is O(n), so 4000 * 4000 = 16 million operations. Each being a shift of the list elements. For 4000 elements, each shift is moving 3999 elements, then 3998, etc. That's O(n^2) time, which may be too slow for 1 second.

Wait, 16 million operations in Python can take about a second or more. So for n=4000, this could be a problem.

So how to optimize this.

Alternative approach: represent the queue as a deque, but when processing the v effect, since we need to process the first (up to v) elements, perhaps using a deque and modifying the elements in place.

But in Python, deque elements can be accessed by index, but modifying them in place is O(1) per access. So for example, after treating a child, the remaining queue is the deque. Then, for k in 0 to min(v, len(deque))-1:

   deque[k] = (v, d, p - (v_i -k), index)

But modifying deque elements by index is possible. Because deque allows indexed access (though it's O(n) for elements in the middle, but for k up to v which can be up to 1e6, but in reality, len(deque) is up to 4000. So for each treatment step, the code would be:

After popping the treated child from the deque:

v_i = treated_child.v

for k in range(min(v_i, len(deque))):

    reduction = v_i -k

    if reduction <=0:

        break

    child = deque[k]

    new_p = child[2] - reduction

    deque[k] = (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3])

But deque allows assignment to index k. However, the underlying implementation of deque is a doubly-linked list, which allows O(1) access to the front and back, but O(n) for arbitrary indices. So accessing deque[k] for k up to 4000 would take O(k) time each. For example, in the worst case, if v_i is 4000, then for each k from 0 to 3999, accessing deque[k] would take O(k) time. So the total time for this loop would be O(v_i^2), which for v_i=4000 would be 16 million operations. Which again could be a problem.

So this approach may not be feasible.

Alternative idea: convert the deque to a list for the processing of the v effect, then convert back to deque. But that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, just use a list for the queue. When we process the treated child, we pop index 0 (O(n) time). Then, apply the v effect to the remaining list. For the v effect, loop through the first min(v, len(queue)) elements, subtract (v -k) from their p. Then process the chain reaction on this list, and then the remaining elements form the new queue.

But in this case, the cost of popping from the front is O(n) per step, which is O(n^2) total.

So for n=4000, this is 16 million operations, which may be tight in Python.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to model the queue to avoid popping from the front each time.

Alternative idea: manage the queue as a list, but track the starting index. For example, use a list and a pointer to the front. But this complicates the code, especially when applying the v effect (since the first element after the treated child is the start of the queue).

Alternatively, perhaps using a linked list structure, but that's not feasible in Python for speed.

Another alternative: precompute the order in which the children will be treated, but that's not possible because the queue is modified dynamically.

Hmm. So perhaps the only way is to proceed with the list-based approach and see.

But let's think about the example where n=4000. Each treatment step:

- Pop the first element: O(n) time (since list.pop(0) shifts all elements).

So for 4000 steps, this is O(n^2) time. Which is 4000*4000=16 million operations. Each operation is shifting a list of 4000, then 3999, etc. Each shift is O(n) time. So total time is O(n^2). Which in Python is probably too slow for 1 second.

So for n=4000, this approach may not work.

Alternative approach: model the queue as a deque, and for the v effect, process the first min(v_i, len(queue)) elements. But in a deque, modifying elements by index is possible, but how to do it efficiently.

Wait, in Python, the deque allows __getitem__ and __setitem__, but the time per access is O(n) in the worst case. So for example, accessing deque[k] would take O(k) time, since the deque is a doubly-linked list. So for each k in the loop, it's O(k) time. So for k up to 4000, the total time per treatment step is O(v_i^2) (for v_i=4000, it's 4000^2 steps). Which is 16 million steps per treatment step, and 4000 steps would be 64e9 operations. Which is impossible.

Therefore, using a deque is not feasible for the v effect step.

Alternative idea: precompute the v effect steps.

Wait, the v effect affects the first len(queue) elements, but up to v_i steps. So for each treatment step, we need to apply the reduction to the first min(v_i, len(queue)) elements. For each of these elements, the reduction is (v_i -k), where k is 0-based.

But how to apply this to the queue quickly.

Another approach: when applying the v effect, collect the indices that need to be modified, then create a new list for the queue. For example:

After popping the first child, the remaining queue is a list. For the first min(v_i, len(queue)) elements, each k in 0 to min(v_i, len(queue)) -1:

queue[k] = (..., p - (v_i -k))

But this can be done with list comprehensions or slicing.

But in Python, modifying the elements in the list in place is O(1) per element. So for k in 0 to m-1:

queue[k] = (v, d, p - (v_i -k), index)

Each assignment is O(1), and the loop is O(m) time, where m is min(v_i, len(queue)).

So for v_i up to 1e6, but len(queue) up to 4000, the loop runs 4000 times per step.

This is manageable.

But the problem remains with the list.pop(0) being O(n) time. For 4000 steps, each with O(n) pop(0), the total time is O(n^2), which is 16 million operations. Which may be acceptable, but perhaps in Python it's tight.

Alternative idea: reverse the queue and use pop from the end. Wait, no. Because the first child is the next to be treated. So reversing the queue would make the first child the last element, but then popping from the end would be O(1). But this would require reversing the queue each time.

Alternatively, manage the queue as a list, but track the start and end indices. But this requires more complex code.

Alternatively, instead of popping from the front, keep track of the current position in the list.

Wait, for example, the queue is a list, and a variable 'start' which is the index of the first element. But when we need to pop the first element, we just increment start. Then, the actual queue is the slice [start:].

But how to manage the v effect. When applying the v effect, the first element in the queue is start. So when we need to access the k-th element, it's start +k.

But this approach can lead to O(1) pop from the front (just increment start), but the list can have unused elements in the front. However, for memory management, we can periodically slice the list to remove the unused elements.

But for the v effect, when we need to process the first m elements (m = min(v_i, len(queue))), which are elements [start, start+1, ..., start +m -1], the code would need to loop from k=0 to m-1, and access the element at start +k.

But in Python, lists are zero-based, so if the queue is stored as a list, and start is the index of the first element, then for the current queue, the available elements are from start to the end.

So for example:

queue = [A, B, C, D, E]

start = 0. The queue is [A, B, C, D, E].

After popping the first element (A), start becomes 1. The queue is [B, C, D, E].

When applying the v effect, the first m elements are B, C, etc. For each k in 0 to m-1, the index in the list is start +k.

So modifying the elements in the queue list in place.

This approach can reduce the time for popping the front to O(1) (just incrementing start). But the problem is that the list can grow large. For example, after popping many elements, the start index could be 4000, but the list could be of size 4000. So when we need to access elements start +k, if start +k exceeds the list's length, then we can't. But in practice, the queue length is len(queue) - start.

So the steps would be:

- Initialize queue as a list of all children.

- start = 0.

In each treatment step:

   if start >= len(queue):

       break

   treated_child = queue[start]

   start +=1

   append treated_child's index to result.

   # apply v effect to remaining queue (elements from start to end).

   current_length = len(queue) - start

   m = min(treated_child.v, current_length)

   for k in range(m):

       reduction = treated_child.v -k

       pos = start +k

       queue[pos] = (queue[pos][0], queue[pos][1], queue[pos][2] - reduction, queue[pos][3])

   # process chain reaction on the remaining queue.

   # current queue is queue[start:]

   current_delta =0

   new_queue = []

   for i in range(start, len(queue)):

       child = queue[i]

       effective_p = child[2] - current_delta

       if effective_p <0:

           current_delta += child[1]

       else:

           new_p = effective_p

           new_queue.append( (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3]) )

   # update queue and start:

   queue = new_queue

   start =0

This way, after processing the chain reaction, the queue is replaced with new_queue, and start is reset to 0.

But what about the elements in the original queue after start + i? For example, during the chain reaction processing, we process all children in the current queue (from start to end). Then, new_queue contains the remaining children after applying the chain reaction. So the queue is replaced with new_queue, and start is reset to 0.

This way, each treatment step:

- Popping the first element is O(1) (start +=1).

- Applying the v effect is O(m) time, where m is up to 4000.

- Processing the chain reaction is O(n) time (processing the current queue, which is up to 4000 elements).

- Replacing the queue with new_queue and start=0.

So the total time for each treatment step is O(m + n) time, which for n=4000 is manageable.

This approach would avoid the O(n) pop(0) time, by using a start index. The actual popping is done by incrementing start. However, when applying the v effect, we need to access elements at start +k, which is O(1) per access. Then, after processing the chain reaction, the queue is replaced with a new list, which is O(n) time.

So this approach would significantly reduce the time compared to using list.pop(0) each time.

Yes, this seems like a better approach.

Let's outline the code:

Read n.

children = []

for _ in range(n):

    v, d, p = map(int, input().split())

    children.append( (v, d, p, _+1) )  # _+1 is the original index (1-based)

queue = children.copy()

start =0

result = []

while start < len(queue):

    treated_child = queue[start]

    start +=1

    result.append(treated_child[3])

    # apply v effect to remaining queue (from start onwards)

    current_length = len(queue) - start

    v_i = treated_child[0]

    m = min(v_i, current_length)

    for k in range(m):

        reduction = v_i -k

        if reduction <=0:

            break

        pos = start +k

        # modify queue[pos]

        # queue is a list, and we can directly modify it

        # since pos is start +k, which is <= start +m-1 <= start +v_i-1

        # but since start is now >=1, pos could be >=1.

        # child is queue[pos]

        new_p = queue[pos][2] - reduction

        # update the child's p

        queue[pos] = (queue[pos][0], queue[pos][1], new_p, queue[pos][3])

    # process chain reaction on the remaining queue (from start to end)

    # collect all children from start to end:

    remaining_children = queue[start:]

    # process chain reaction:

    current_delta =0

    new_remaining = []

    for child in remaining_children:

        effective_p = child[2] - current_delta

        if effective_p <0:

            current_delta += child[1]

        else:

            new_p = effective_p

            new_remaining.append( (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3]) )

    # update the queue: queue = new_remaining (from start onwards)

    # but after this, the start is reset to 0, and the queue is new_remaining

    queue = new_remaining

    start =0

So, after processing the chain reaction, the queue becomes new_remaining (the children that are left after the chain reaction). The start is reset to 0, and the next iteration begins.

This approach should be O(k) per treatment step, where k is the number of children remaining after each step. But since each step processes each child in the queue once for the v effect and once for the chain reaction, the total time is O(n^2), which for 4000 is manageable.

But let's test this with the first example:

Input:

5

4 2 2

4 1 2

5 2 4

3 3 5

5 1 2

After initial queue:

children = [
    (4,2,2,1),
    (4,1,2,2),
    (5,2,4,3),
    (3,3,5,4),
    (5,1,2,5)
]

start is 0.

First treatment step:

treated_child is (4,2,2,1). added to result. start becomes 1.

Apply v effect: v_i=4. current_length is len(queue) - start =5-1=4. m= min(4,4)=4.

For k in 0 to3:

reduction =4 -k.

pos =1 +k.

queue[pos] is the child at index 1 +k.

So:

k=0: pos=1. queue[1] is (4,1,2,2). subtract 4. new_p=2-4=-2. So queue[1] becomes (4,1,-2,2).

k=1: pos=2. queue[2] is (5,2,4,3). subtract 4-1=3. new_p=4-3=1.

k=2: pos=3. subtract 4-2=2. queue[3] (3,3,5,4) becomes 5-2=3.

k=3: pos=4. subtract 4-3=1. queue[4] (5,1,2,5) becomes 2-1=1.

So after v effect, queue is:

[
    (4,2,2,1),
    (4,1,-2,2),
    (5,2,1,3),
    (3,3,3,4),
    (5,1,1,5)
]

But start is 1, so remaining children are queue[1:] (indexes 1,2,3,4).

Then, process chain reaction:

remaining_children = [ (4,1,-2,2), (5,2,1,3), (3,3,3,4), (5,1,1,5) ]

current_delta =0.

Process each child:

1. (4,1,-2,2): effective_p = -2 -0 =-2 <0. current_delta +=1 (now 1). Not added.

2. (5,2,1,3): effective_p=1-1=0 >=0. added with p=0.

3. (3,3,3,4): effective_p=3-1=2 >=0. added with p=2.

4. (5,1,1,5): effective_p=1-1=0 >=0. added with p=0.

new_remaining is [ (5,2,0,3), (3,3,2,4), (5,1,0,5) ].

So queue becomes this new_remaining, start is 0.

Next treatment step:

treated_child is (5,2,0,3). added to result. start=1.

v_i=5. current_length is 3-1=2 (since len(queue)=3). m= min(5,2)=2.

Apply v effect to queue[start:] (indexes 1 and 2).

k=0: reduction=5-0=5. pos=1+0=1. queue[1] is (3,3,2,4). subtract 5. new_p=2-5=-3.

k=1: reduction=5-1=4. pos=2. queue[2] is (5,1,0,5). subtract 4. new_p=0-4=-4.

So after this, queue is:

[
    (5,2,0,3),
    (3,3,-3,4),
    (5,1,-4,5)
]

start=1, so remaining_children are queue[1:] → indexes 1 and 2.

Process chain reaction:

current_delta=0.

For child (3,3,-3,4): effective_p =-3 -0 =-3 <0. current_delta +=3.

For child (5,1,-4,5): effective_p =-4 -3 =-7 <0. current_delta +=1.

So new_remaining is empty.

queue is now empty. So the result is [1,3].

Which matches the example.

So this approach works.

Now, let's think about the code:

But in Python, lists are mutable, and we can directly modify their elements. So during the v effect processing, we can loop through k in 0 to m-1, and modify queue[start +k]. This is done in the code.

After that, the remaining_children is queue[start:], which is all the elements from start to end. Then, process them for chain reaction, and collect new_remaining.

Then, set queue = new_remaining and start=0.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, testing for the second example:

Input:

5

4 5 1

5 3 9

4 1 2

2 1 8

4 1 9

The code should output 4 children treated.

But the code should process it correctly.

Overall, this approach should work.

Now, let's code this in Python.

But in Python, lists are zero-based. The code needs to manage the queue as a list, with the start index.

Each child is represented as a tuple (v, d, p, index).

In the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    children = []

    for i in range(n):

        v, d, p = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

        children.append( (v, d, p, i+1) )

    queue = children.copy()

    start = 0

    result = []

    while start < len(queue):

        # Treat the first child (at start index)

        treated_child = queue[start]

        start +=1

        result.append( treated_child[3] )

        # Apply v effect to the remaining children (start to end of queue)

        current_length = len(queue) - start

        v_i = treated_child[0]

        m = min(v_i, current_length)

        for k in range(m):

            reduction = v_i - k

            if reduction <=0:

                break

            pos = start + k

            # Update the child's p

            child = queue[pos]

            new_p = child[2] - reduction

            queue[pos] = (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3])

        # Process chain reaction on remaining_children = queue[start:]

        remaining_children = queue[start:]

        current_delta = 0

        new_remaining = []

        for child in remaining_children:

            effective_p = child[2] - current_delta

            if effective_p <0:

                current_delta += child[1]

            else:

                new_p = effective_p

                new_remaining.append( (child[0], child[1], new_p, child[3]) )

        # Update queue and reset start

        queue = new_remaining

        start =0

    # Output the result

    print(len(result), file=output_stream)

    print(' '.join(map(str, result)), file=output_stream)
