Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if, starting with a certain number of details 'a', the production process will eventually stop. The stopping condition is when the number of details becomes divisible by 'm'. Each day, the factory adds x mod m details, where x is the current number of details. 

Hmm, let's think about the process. Each day, the number of details increases by x mod m. So the next day's x is x + (x mod m). Wait, right. So we start with a, then each step we compute x = x + (x mod m). We need to check if at any point x becomes a multiple of m. If yes, output "Yes", else "No".

But how do we model this? Let's see some examples. Like the first sample input: 1 and 5. The steps would be:

Day 1: x=1. 1 mod 5 is 1. So next x is 1+1=2. Then 2 mod5 is 2, so x becomes 4. Then 4 mod5 is 4 → x=8. Then 8 mod5 is 3 → 8+3=11. Then 11 mod5 is 1 → 12. Then 12 mod5 is 2 → 14. Hmm, this seems to be increasing but not hitting a multiple of 5. So output is No. 

In the second example, 3 and 6. The first step: x=3. 3 mod6 is 3, so x becomes 6. Which is divisible by 6. So output Yes.

So the problem reduces to simulating the steps until either x becomes a multiple of m (return Yes) or we detect that it will never happen (return No).

But the problem is, for large a and m, simulating each step could be time-consuming. For example, if a and m are up to 1e5, then in the worst case, each step could take up to m steps. But 1e5 steps per test case is manageable? Let's see. The time limit is 1 second, which is about 1e8 operations. So for 1e5 steps, even 1e5 test cases would be okay, but here each test case is a single input. So if each test case can take up to 1e5 steps, then 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations would be way too slow. Wait, but in this problem, each test case is a single input. So the input size is two numbers, so in practice, per test case, we need an O(1) or O(m) algorithm. Wait, but m can be up to 1e5. So O(m) is acceptable for 1e5 steps, which would take about a millisecond. But is there a smarter way?

Wait, let's think about the mathematical properties here. Let's model the problem. Each step x becomes x + x mod m. Let's denote x mod m as r. So x = k*m + r. Then x mod m is r. So the next x is k*m + r + r = k*m + 2r. The new x mod m would be (k*m + 2r) mod m = (2r) mod m. Wait, but that's the new r. But maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see. 

Wait, maybe after each step, the remainder when divided by m doubles. Let's see. Suppose that initially, the remainder is r0. Then x0 = a, r0 = x0 mod m. Then x1 = x0 + r0. The new remainder r1 = x1 mod m. But x1 = x0 + r0. Since r0 = x0 mod m, x0 can be written as q*m + r0. Then x1 = q*m + r0 + r0 = q*m + 2r0. So x1 mod m is (2r0) mod m. So r1 = (2r0) mod m. Similarly, the next step x2 = x1 + r1, which is (x1) + (x1 mod m). But x1 mod m is r1, which is 2r0 mod m. So x2 mod m is (r1 + r1) mod m = 2r1 mod m. But r1 is (2r0) mod m. So r2 = 2r1 mod m = 2*(2r0 mod m) mod m. 

Wait, so the remainder at each step is doubling each time, modulo m. So the sequence of remainders is r0, (2r0) mod m, (2^2 r0) mod m, ..., (2^k r0) mod m. 

But wait, is that the case? Let's test this with the first example. 

First example: a=1, m=5. So r0=1. Then x1 = 1+1=2. r1=2 mod5=2. Then x2=2+2=4. r2=4 mod5=4. Then x3=4+4=8. r3=8 mod5=3. Then x4=8+3=11. r4=11 mod5=1. Then x5=11+1=12 → r5=2 mod5=2. Wait, here the sequence of r is 1, 2,4,3,1,2,4,3,... which is a cycle. So the remainders aren't just doubling each step. So my previous conclusion was incorrect. So there's a mistake in that reasoning. 

So maybe the initial approach was wrong. Let's re-examine the process. 

Each step, x becomes x + (x mod m). Let's denote x as k*m + r, where 0 ≤ r < m. Then x mod m is r. So the next x is x + r = k*m + r + r = k*m + 2r. The new x is (k*m) + 2r. So the new remainder when divided by m is (2r) mod m. So the remainder after each step is 2r mod m. 

Wait, that's a crucial insight. Because the new x is k*m + 2r, and when divided by m, the remainder is 2r mod m. So the remainder at each step is (2 * previous remainder) mod m. 

So the remainder sequence is r0, (2r0) mod m, (4r0) mod m, (8r0) mod m, and so on. But this would imply that the remainder is doubling each time, modulo m. 

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier example. Let's re-examine the first example. 

In the first example, a=1, m=5. So r0 is 1. Then according to the model, the next remainder should be 2*1 mod5=2, then 2*2=4 mod5=4, then 2*4=8 mod5=3, then 2*3=6 mod5=1. Then again 2*1=2, and so on. So the sequence of remainders is 1,2,4,3,1,2,4,3,... which is exactly what we observed. So in this case, the remainder is indeed doubling each step modulo m. So the process is equivalent to repeatedly multiplying the remainder by 2 modulo m. 

If that's the case, then the problem reduces to checking whether 0 is in the sequence generated by starting with r0 = a mod m and then each step is (previous * 2) mod m. 

Wait, but what's the original x? For example, even if the remainder becomes zero, that's when x is a multiple of m. So the problem is equivalent to checking if during this process, the remainder ever becomes zero. 

But wait, the remainder can't be zero unless the current x is a multiple of m. Because the remainder is x mod m, which is zero only when x is a multiple of m. So the problem reduces to: starting with r0 = a mod m, does the sequence r_{n} = (2^n * r0) mod m ever equal zero? 

Wait, but wait. Let's see. Let's model the sequence as r_{n} = (2^n * r0) mod m. Then, we need to check if there exists some n ≥0 such that (2^n * r0) mod m ==0. 

But is that correct? Because in each step, the remainder is multiplied by 2 mod m. So the sequence is r0, 2r0 mod m, 4r0 mod m, 8r0 mod m, etc. So the nth term is r0 * 2^n mod m. 

So the question becomes: does there exist an n ≥0 such that 2^n * r0 ≡0 mod m. 

But r0 is a mod m. So r0 is in [0, m-1]. But wait, a can be greater than m. For example, if a=7 and m=5, then r0=7 mod5=2, and the initial x is 7. Then the next x is 7 +2=9, whose mod5 is 4. Then x=9+4=13, mod5=3. Then 13+3=16 mod5=1, etc. So the remainder sequence is 2,4,3,1,2,... which is 2*2=4 mod5, 4*2=8 mod5=3, etc. 

So the problem now is to check if for some n ≥0, 2^n * r0 ≡0 mod m. 

But how can this equation hold? Let's see. Let's denote r0 as a mod m. So r0 could be 0, but if a mod m is zero, then the first day x is a, which is a multiple of m. So output would be yes. So first check: if a mod m is zero, then answer is yes. 

Otherwise, we need to check if 2^n * r0 mod m can be zero for some n ≥1. 

So the problem reduces to: given r0 (a mod m) and m, is there some exponent k ≥0 such that 2^k * r0 ≡0 mod m. 

But how to compute this? 

Let's consider that 2^k * r0 ≡0 mod m → m divides 2^k * r0. 

So, m must divide 2^k * r0. Let's factor m into its prime factors. Let’s compute the greatest common divisor of m and r0. Let's denote d = gcd(r0, m). Then, we can write m = d * m', r0 = d * r0', where gcd(r0', m') =1. Then, the condition becomes d*m' divides d*r0' * 2^k → m' divides r0' * 2^k. But since r0' and m' are coprime, m' must divide 2^k. So, m' should be a divisor of some power of 2. That is, m' must be of the form 2^s for some s ≥0. 

So, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Compute r0 = a mod m. If r0 ==0, output yes.
2. Else, compute d = gcd(r0, m). Then m = d * m', r0 = d * r0'. Then, m' must divide 2^k for some k. So m' must be a power of two. So check if m' is a power of two. If yes, output yes. Else, no.

Wait, that's a key insight. Let me think again. 

We need m' to be a divisor of 2^k for some k. So m' must have all its prime factors equal to 2. Because 2^k's prime factors are just 2. So m' must be a power of two. 

So the steps are:

- If r0 ==0 → yes.
- Else compute d = gcd(r0, m). Then m' = m/d. Then check if m' is a power of two. If yes, then yes; else, no.

Because, in that case, there exists a k such that 2^k >= s (where m' is 2^s). So for example, m' is 8 (which is 2^3), then 2^3 * ... will be divisible by 8. 

Wait, but why is this the case? Let's see. 

After factoring, we have:

r0 = d * r0'
m = d * m'

with gcd(r0', m') =1. 

We need 2^k * r0 ≡0 mod m → 2^k * d r0' ≡0 mod d m' → 2^k r0' ≡0 mod m'. 

Since r0' and m' are coprime, m' must divide 2^k. Because since r0' and m' are coprime, the product 2^k r0' can only have factors of 2 and factors from r0'. But since m' is coprime to r0', the only possible common factors between m' and 2^k r0' are the factors of 2. So m' must be a power of two.

Thus, the problem reduces to checking if after dividing m by d (where d is gcd(r0, m)), the remaining part is a power of two.

So the algorithm steps are:

Compute r0 = a % m. If r0 is zero, output yes.

Else, compute d = gcd(r0, m). Then compute m' = m / d. Check if m' is a power of two. If yes, output yes, else no.

This is a O(1) approach (assuming efficient checking for power of two). 

Let's test this with the examples.

First example: input 1 5.

a=1, m=5.

r0 = 1 mod5 =1. Which is not zero.

d = gcd(1,5) =1. m' =5/1=5. Check if 5 is a power of two. 5 is not, so output no. Which matches the sample.

Second example: input 3 6.

a=3, m=6.

r0=3 mod6=3.

d = gcd(3,6) =3. m' =6/3=2. 2 is a power of two. So output yes.

Another example: a=4, m=6.

r0=4 mod6=4.

d= gcd(4,6)=2. m' =6/2=3. 3 is not a power of two. So output no.

But let's see what happens. The remainders would be 4 mod6=4. Next x is 4 +4=8. 8 mod6=2. Then next x is 8+2=10. 10 mod6=4. Then x=10+4=14 mod6=2. So cycle between 4,2,4,2... never hitting zero. So output is no. Which matches the condition.

Another example: a=6, m=6 → r0=0 → output yes.

Another example: a=2, m=8. r0=2 mod8=2. d=2 and m'=8/2=4. 4 is 2^2 → yes. So output yes. Let's see:

x starts at 2. next x is 2 +2=4. 4 mod8=4 → x=4. Then x+4=8. 8 mod8=0. So output yes.

So the algorithm seems correct.

So the steps in code would be:

1. Read a and m.

2. r0 = a % m. If r0 is 0: print yes.

3. Else compute d = gcd(r0, m).

4. Compute m_prime = m // d.

5. Check if m_prime is a power of two.

6. If yes, output yes. Else no.

So now, how to check if m_prime is a power of two.

A number is a power of two if it's greater than zero and (n & (n-1)) == 0.

For example, 8: 1000 in binary. 8-1=7 (0111). 8 &7=0. So yes.

For 0, but m_prime can't be zero since m >=1, and d divides m, so m_prime is at least 1.

So code for checking power of two:

def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n !=0 and (n & (n-1)) ==0

But wait, for n=1. 1 is 2^0. So yes.

Testing n=1: 1-1=0. 1 &0 ==0. So returns True. Which is correct.

So the code steps:

Read a, m.

r0 = a % m.

if r0 ==0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    d = gcd(r0, m)
    m_prime = m //d
    if (m_prime & (m_prime -1)) ==0:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

But how to compute gcd in Python. We can use math.gcd, but note that in Python's math.gcd, if both numbers are zero, but since in our case, r0 is non-zero (since we checked r0 !=0 before), and m is >=1. So no problem.

Wait, when r0 is zero, we have already handled that case. So in the else case, r0 is non-zero, so math.gcd(r0, m) can be computed.

But let's think about possible edge cases.

For example, when a=0 (but according to the input constraints, a and m are >=1. So the problem says 1 ≤ a, m ≤ 1e5. So a can't be zero. So the input a is at least 1. So r0 can't be zero unless m divides a. For example, a=5, m=5: r0=0. So the code handles that.

Another test case: a=2, m=7. r0=2. d=gcd(2,7)=1. m_prime=7. 7 is not a power of two. So output no.

But let's see:

x starts at 2. Then next x is 2+2=4. mod7=4. Then x=4+4=8 → mod7=1. Then x=8+1=9 mod7=2. Then x=9+2=11 mod7=4. Then x=11+4=15 mod7=1. Then x=15+1=16 mod7=2. So the remainders cycle between 2,4,1,2,4,1, etc. So zero is never reached. So output is no.

Which matches the code's output.

Another test case: a=4, m=8. r0=4 mod8=4. d=gcd(4,8)=4. m_prime=8/4=2. Which is a power of two. So output yes. 

Process: x=4 → 4+4=8 mod8=0 → yes.

So code works.

Thus, the code can be written as:

Read a and m. Compute r0 = a % m. If zero, yes. Else compute d = gcd(r0, m). m_prime = m//d. Check if m_prime is a power of two. If yes, output yes, else no.

Now, code in Python:

But need to handle the case where m_prime is 1. Because 1 is 2^0.

So the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import math


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    a, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    r0 = a % m
    if r0 == 0:
        print("Yes", file=output_stream)
    else:
        d = math.gcd(r0, m)
        m_prime = m // d
        if (m_prime & (m_prime - 1)) == 0:
            print("Yes", file=output_stream)
        else:
            print("No", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 2:

Input:3 6.

r0=3%6=3. d=3. m_prime=6/3=2. 2 is 10. 2&1=0 → yes.

Another test case: a=3, m=3 → r0=0 → yes.

Another test case: a=2, m=8. r0=2. d=2. m_prime=4. 4 is 100, 4&3=0 → yes. So output yes. Which is correct.

Thus, this code should work correctly.
