<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about a calculator with two cells. The first starts at 1, the second at 0. Each move, we can either increment the second cell by 1 (operation 1) or multiply the first cell by the second cell's current value (operation 2). We need to find how many integers x between l and r (inclusive) can be produced in at most p moves.

Hmm. The key is to model all possible sequences of operations that can generate these x values efficiently, especially considering the constraints. Since p can be up to 100, and l and r up to 1e9, a brute-force approach might not work. Let's think of this as a state problem where each state is (a, b, steps_used). But even then, the possibilities could explode quickly.

Wait, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about the possible sequences. For example, to get a value a in the first cell, you need to have done operation 2 at some points. Each operation 2 multiplies the first cell by the current value of the second cell. But the second cell can only be incremented via operation 1. So the steps must be a combination of incrementing and multiplying.

Let me consider how to generate a possible a. Each a is the product of some sequence of b values. But each b is built up by increment operations. So for example, suppose you have a sequence of operations like: increment several times, then multiply, then increment more, multiply again, etc.

Each time you perform a multiply operation (operation 2), the current b is added to the product. So the a is the product of the b values at each multiplication step. But the order of operations matters. Let's model the possible states.

Let's think in terms of when the multiply operations happen. Each multiply takes the current b and multiplies a by it. Then, the b can continue to be incremented. So the possible a values are products of a subset of the b values generated through the steps.

For example, if after some steps, the b's that were used in multiplies are b1, b2, ..., bk. Then a is the product of those b's. The steps taken would be the sum of (the increments between each multiply) plus the multiplies themselves.

Wait, how does the sequence work?

Let's say the operations are:

1. Do some increments (operation 1) to get b up to x1. Then multiply (operation 2). Now a becomes 1 * x1 = x1. Then do more increments to get b up to x2. Multiply again. Now a is x1 * x2. And so on.

So each multiplication step uses the current value of b. The increments between multiplies determine the x_i values.

So the total number of operations is (sum of the increments between multiplies) + the number of multiplies. Because each multiply is one operation, and each increment between multiplies is the number of increments done before that multiply.

For example, if you have x1, x2, x3 as the multipliers. The steps would be:

- Increment x1-1 times (since initial b is 0, the first operation must be at least one increment to get to x1=1? Wait, no. Wait, initial state is a=1, b=0. So the first operation can be either:

Option 1: Do operation 1. Now b becomes 1. Then, perhaps do another operation 1 (b becomes 2), then multiply. So the x1 is 2. So the steps are 2 increments (2 operations) and 1 multiply (total 3 steps), leading to a = 2.

Alternatively, after the first increment (operation 1), b is 1, then multiply (operation 2). That uses 2 steps (1 increment and 1 multiply). So a becomes 1 * 1 = 1. But that's the initial value. Not useful.

Hmm, but the problem says that the first cell starts at 1, the second at 0. So the first operation must be operation 1. Otherwise, if you try to multiply first, the second cell is 0, which would set a to 0. But once a is 0, all subsequent operations can't change it (since multiplying by anything else leaves it 0). So the first operation must be operation 1 to get b to 1, then maybe multiply.

So the sequence of operations must start with some number of increments (at least one), then a multiply, then more increments, then multiply, etc. Each multiply step uses the current b.

So the possible x values (the a's) are products of a set of b's, where each b is at least 1, and the sum of (the increments between multiplies) plus the number of multiplies is <= p.

Wait, let's break it down. Let's say that there are k multiplies. Each multiply is an operation. So for k multiplies, that's k operations. Then, between each multiply, there are some increments. Also, before the first multiply, there must be some increments.

So the total steps would be:

sum_{i=0}^{k} (number of increments before the i-th multiply) ) + k <= p.

Wait, indexes might be tricky here. Let's consider that before the first multiply, you have m0 increments (must be >=1?), then a multiply. Then between multiply 1 and 2, m1 increments (can be 0?), then multiply. And so on, until after the k-th multiply, there's no multiply. So total steps would be (sum of all m_i from i=0 to k) ) + k.

Wait, no. Because each multiply is one step, and each increment is one step. So for each multiply, there's a sequence of increments (each one step) followed by a multiply (another step). But the increments after the last multiply don't contribute to the a value.

Wait, but the a is only the product of the b's at the time of multiplication. So any increments after the last multiply don't affect a. So for the purpose of generating a, the steps after the last multiply (if they are increments) are irrelevant. However, the problem allows up to p moves. So if after generating a certain a, you can have some more steps (like increments) as long as the total steps do not exceed p.

But the a will be fixed once the last multiply is done. So the way to model this is that the product of the b's at the times of the multiplies gives the a. Then, the steps used are the sum of the increments between multiplies (including before the first multiply) plus the number of multiply steps (each is one step). The remaining steps (up to p) can be filled with any operations (like increments) that don't affect a. So to model all possible a's, we need to consider all possible sequences of multiply steps and increments between them, such that the sum of the increments between multiplies plus the number of multiplies is <= p. Because the remaining steps can be filled with increments (operation 1), which don't affect a.

So the key insight here is that to generate a possible a, the steps needed are the sum of (m_0 + m_1 + ... + m_{k-1}) ) + k, where m_i is the number of increments between the i-th and (i+1)-th multiply. Then, the remaining steps (p - (sum m_i + k)) can be any steps (increments or multiplies, but after the last multiply, any multiply would multiply a by the new b, which would change a. But since after generating a, we can't have any more multiplies, because that would change the a. So any steps after the last multiply must be increments (operation 1) only. Otherwise, if you do a multiply after that, the a would be multiplied again, leading to a different a.

Wait, but the problem allows us to perform at most p moves. So the a is the value after performing exactly some number of moves (<= p). So the a could be generated by a sequence of steps where the last step is a multiply. Or, if the last step is an increment, then the a remains as it was after the last multiply.

So the a is the product of the b's at the times of the multiply steps. The steps used for generating that a is the sum of the increments between multiplies (each m_i steps) plus the number of multiplies (k steps). The remaining steps can be filled with increments (since adding them doesn't change a). But the total steps must be <= p. So the sum (sum m_i) +k + s <=p, where s is the number of increments after the last multiply (s >=0). But since s can be up to (p - (sum m_i +k)), and we can choose to take any s in that range, then the minimal steps required to generate a particular a is sum m_i +k. As long as this minimal steps is <=p, then the a can be generated in s' steps where s' = sum m_i +k + s, for s >=0 and s' <= p. So the a is possible as long as sum m_i +k <= p.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible a's that can be generated by any sequence of multiply steps and increments between them, such that sum m_i +k <= p. Because then, with the remaining steps (up to p), you can do whatever (but not affect a).

So the minimal steps to generate a is sum m_i +k. So as long as sum m_i +k <=p, then a is possible.

So the problem now is to generate all possible a's that can be written as the product of some sequence of b's, where each b is the sum of the increments up to that point. Let's model the possible sequences.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The first multiply happens after m0 increments. So the first b is m0. Then, after the first multiply, the a becomes 1 * m0 = m0. Then, after m1 increments (each adding 1 to b), the next multiply uses b = m0 + m1. Then the a becomes m0 * (m0 +m1). Then, after m2 increments, the next multiply uses b = m0 +m1 +m2, and so on. So the product is m0 * (m0 + m1) * (m0 + m1 + m2) * ... * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} m_i). So each term in the product is the sum of the m_i's up to that point.

Wait, no. Let's see:

The first multiply is after m0 increments. So the initial b is 0. Then, after m0 increments, b becomes m0. Then multiply, so a becomes 1 * m0 = m0. Then, the next m1 increments: each adds 1, so b becomes m0 + m1. Then multiply again: a becomes m0 * (m0 + m1). Then m2 increments: b becomes m0 + m1 + m2. Multiply again: a becomes m0*(m0 +m1)*(m0 +m1 +m2), etc. So for k multiplies, the product is the product of the terms:

term_1 = m0

term_2 = m0 + m1

term_3 = m0 + m1 + m2

...

term_k = m0 + m1 + ... + m_{k-1}

Each m_i is >=0, except m0 must be >=1 (since after initial state, first operation must be increment to get b to 1 or higher). Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is a=1, b=0. So the first operation must be operation 1 (since if you do operation 2 first, you multiply a by 0, which sets it to 0, and then all subsequent operations can't change a). But to have a non-zero a, the first operation must be operation 1. So m0 must be at least 1. Then, after m0 increments, you multiply.

But wait, m0 is the number of increments before the first multiply, which is m0 steps. So after m0 increments, the b is m0 (since initial b is 0, adding 1 m0 times gives m0). Then multiply.

So the first term is m0, which must be at least 1. The subsequent terms can be zero? Wait, the m1 is the number of increments between first and second multiply. So if m1 is zero, then between the first and second multiply, there are no increments. So after the first multiply, the b is m0. Then, you do zero increments (so m1=0) and perform a multiply. Then the second term is m0 + m1 = m0. So the product is m0 * m0. Then, if you do m2 increments, etc.

But the m's after m0 can be zero. Because between multiply steps, you can choose to do zero increments. So the sum of m_i from i=0 to k-1 is the total number of increments between multiplies. And the sum plus k (the number of multiply steps) must be <=p.

So the problem reduces to finding all possible products of sequences of integers, where each term in the product is the sum of the first i+1 m's (for the i-th term), and the sum of all m's (m0, m1, ..., m_{k-1}) plus k (the number of multiplies) must be <=p. And m0 >=1, the other m_i >=0.

Wait, but the sum of m's plus k is the total steps taken for the multiplies and the increments between them. So for each possible sequence of m0, m1, ..., m_{k-1} where m0 >=1, and m_i >=0 for i >=1, and sum (m_i) + k <=p, the product of the terms (sum_{j=0}^i m_j) for i from 0 to k-1 is a possible a. Then, we need to collect all such a's and count how many fall into [l, r].

So the approach is to generate all possible products that can be formed by such sequences, considering all possible k (number of multiplies) up to p (since each multiply is a step). For each k, the sum of the m_i's plus k must be <=p. Also, m0 >=1, m1, m2, ... >=0.

But how can we generate all these products efficiently? Because for p up to 100, the number of possibilities might be manageable if we can model it as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me think: for each possible step count s (from 1 to p), and for each possible current value of the product and current sum of m's, we can track the possible a's. Wait, but the product can get very large (up to 1e9), which is the upper limit for r. So tracking all possible a's for each step could be feasible if the number of possible a's per step is manageable.

Alternatively, we can model this with BFS, where each state is (current product, current sum of m's, remaining steps). The sum of m's here is the sum of m0 + m1 + ... up to the current point, but perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, each time we perform a multiply, the new term added is the sum of m0 + ... + m_{i} for the i-th multiply. Wait, perhaps the sum of m's up to the current point is the current value of b before the multiply. So each term in the product is the value of b when the multiply is performed.

Let me see: the first multiply is after m0 increments (so b = m0). The second multiply is after m1 increments (b becomes m0 + m1). The third multiply is after m2 increments (b becomes m0 + m1 + m2). So each term in the product is the sum of m0 + ... + m_{i} for the i-th multiply (0-based?).

Wait, for the first multiply (k=1), the term is m0. For the second multiply (k=2), the term is m0 + m1. For the third multiply (k=3), the term is m0 + m1 + m2. So the product is m0 * (m0 +m1) * (m0 +m1 + m2) * ... for each multiply.

But the sum of all m_i's (including those up to the (k-1)-th) is equal to the sum of m0 + m1 + ... + m_{k-1} = S. Then, the steps used are S + k (since each m_i is increments and each multiply is a step). So S +k <= p.

But S can be up to (p -k). Since S +k <=p → S <= p -k. So S can be from (m0 >=1) for k=1: m0 <= (p -1) (since S +1 <=p → m0 <= p-1).

So for each possible k (number of multiplies), the sum S = sum m_i from i=0 to k-1 must be <= p -k, and m0 >=1, m_i >=0 for i>=1.

But how to generate all possible products for all possible k and possible S.

This seems challenging. Let's think of k as the number of multiplies. For each k, the minimal steps is k + sum m_i >=k (since sum m_i >= m0 >=1 for k>=1). Wait, no. For example, for k=1, sum m_i = m0 >=1. So steps used are m0 +1. Which must be <=p.

So for each k, the possible sum S = sum m_i must be >=k (if m0 >=1 for k=1, sum m_i >=1. For k=2, sum m_i = m0 + m1 >=1 (since m0 >=1) etc. Not sure. Wait, for k=2, sum m_i is m0 +m1. m0 >=1, m1 >=0. So sum >=1. So steps used is sum m_i + 2. So sum m_i can be up to p-2.

But how can we model all possible combinations for different k.

Alternative approach: Let's model the possible products using dynamic programming. For each possible step s (up to p), track all possible pairs (current product, current sum of m's). The sum of m's here is the sum of all m_i's up to the current multiply steps. Because when you add a new multiply, the new term is sum_m_prev + m_new_increments.

Wait, here's a possible way to model this:

We can use a BFS approach where each state is (current product, sum_b, steps_used), where sum_b is the sum of m_i's up to the current point (i.e., the value of b before the next multiply). steps_used is the total steps taken so far (sum m_i's up to now plus the number of multiplies done). Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

When we start, there are 0 steps used, and the product is 1, sum_b is 0 (since no increments have been done). But the first step must be an increment. So perhaps the initial state is after the first increment. Wait, maybe the initial state is (product=1, sum_b=0, steps_used=0). Then, for each possible state, we can decide to perform some increments followed by a multiply.

Alternatively, think of the state as the product so far, the current value of b (sum of m's up to now), and the number of steps used (sum of increments and multiply steps). Then, for each state, we can choose to perform a multiply (adding the current b to the product, and steps_used increases by 1). Or perform some increments (steps_used increases by the number of increments), and then a multiply (steps_used increases by 1).

Wait, but the sequence must be that after each multiply, you can increment as much as you want (up to remaining steps) before the next multiply. So perhaps the BFS approach would be:

Each state is (product, current_b, steps_used, k), where product is the current product (a), current_b is the value of the second cell (b), steps_used is the number of steps taken so far, and k is the number of multiplies done.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, think of each possible step as the possible number of increments followed by a multiply. For example, from a state (product, current_b, steps_used), after m increments (each adding 1 to current_b and 1 step per increment), then a multiply (steps_used increases by 1, product becomes product * (current_b + m), current_b becomes current_b + m + ... ? No, after the increments, current_b is current_b + m. Then multiply step sets a to product * (current_b + m). Wait, current_b is the value before the increments. So if we do m increments, current_b increases by m, then multiply.

But the state after the multiply would have a new product (product * (current_b + m)), and the current_b would be (current_b + m). Because after the multiply, the next increments would start from that new current_b. So the next multiply would add the sum of increments after that.

Hmm. So the state transitions would be:

For a current state (product, current_b, steps_used), the remaining steps is p - steps_used. We can choose to perform m increments (m >=0) such that m + 1 (for the multiply) <= remaining steps. Then, after m increments, current_b becomes current_b + m. Then, multiply: product becomes product * (current_b + m), steps_used increases by m + 1. The new current_b is current_b + m. Then, this new state can be used for further steps.

But how do we model this? Because for each state, we can choose any m >=0 such that m +1 <= remaining steps. For example, if remaining steps is s, then m can be from 0 to s -1.

But considering all possible m for each state could be computationally expensive. Especially if p is up to 100.

But given that p is up to 100, and the possible current_b values can be up to (p steps of increments), maybe the total number of states is manageable.

So the approach would be:

- Initialize a set of possible products. Start with product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0.

- For each state, consider all possible m (number of increments) that can be done before the next multiply. For each possible m, check if steps_used + m +1 <=p.

- For each m, compute new_steps = steps_used + m +1, new_b = current_b + m, new_product = product * (current_b + m).

- Add this new state (new_product, new_b, new_steps) to the queue, and track all possible products generated.

- Also, even if after a multiply, there are remaining steps, but not enough to perform any more multiplies (since you can do increments after the last multiply). However, those increments don't change the product. So once a product is generated with steps_used <=p, any additional steps can be filled with increments, which don't affect the product. So for each state (product, current_b, steps_used), even if steps_used <=p, the product is valid. So all such products are possible.

Thus, the algorithm can proceed as follows:

1. Use BFS to generate all possible products by considering each possible state and the possible m increments followed by a multiply.

2. For each state, track the product, current_b, steps_used.

3. For each state, generate all possible m (number of increments before multiply) such that steps_used + m +1 <=p.

4. Add the new states to the queue.

5. Keep a memoization (like a visited set) to avoid revisiting the same product, current_b, steps_used state, which could have multiple paths leading to it.

Wait, but even if two different paths lead to the same product, current_b, steps_used, it's redundant to process them again. So we can track visited states as (product, current_b, steps_used). But given that product can be up to 1e9, and current_b up to p (since each step can add m increments, but steps are limited to 100), the number of possible states is manageable.

Wait, product can be up to (sum of increments and multiplies) to the power of the number of multiplies. For p=100, this can be very large, but the problem says that l and r are up to 1e9. So any product exceeding r can be ignored. So during the BFS, whenever the product exceeds r, we can prune that branch.

So the steps would be:

- Initialize a queue with (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0).

- For each state in the queue:

   - If steps_used > p: skip.

   - Else, add the product to a set of possible a's if steps_used <=p.

   - Then, consider all possible m increments (m >=0) followed by a multiply.

   - For each possible m, compute new_steps = steps_used + m +1. If new_steps > p: skip.

   - Compute new_b = current_b + m. The new product is product * new_b.

   - If new_product > r: skip (since any further multiplies would make it larger, and we can't have x <= r).

   - Check if (new_product, new_b, new_steps) has been visited. If not, add to the queue and mark as visited.

- After processing all possible states, collect all a's in the set where l <=a <=r.

But wait, when steps_used is less than p, even after a multiply, there can be steps left. For example, after steps_used + m +1 steps (the new_steps), the remaining steps is p - new_steps. These can be filled with increments, which do not affect the a. So the product a is already determined, and the remaining steps can be used for any operations (but since after the last multiply, any multiply would change a, but we can't do that as steps are limited). So the a is valid as long as new_steps <=p.

So in the BFS, when we reach any state (product, current_b, steps_used), then product is a valid a if steps_used <=p, regardless of whether there are remaining steps. Because those remaining steps can be filled with increments. So for each state in the BFS, even if steps_used is less than p, the product is a candidate. So during the BFS, whenever we process a state (product, current_b, steps_used), we should add product to the possible a's if steps_used <=p.

Wait, but what about when steps_used is less than p? For example, after generating a product with steps_used = s <=p, there are (p - s) steps left. These can be any combination of operations (increment or multiply). But if you do a multiply, that will change the product. However, in that case, the BFS would have generated that possibility through the m steps.

Wait, no. Because the BFS models sequences where you choose to perform some increments and then a multiply. So, in the BFS, when you have a state (product, current_b, steps_used), you can choose to do m increments (with m >=0) followed by a multiply, provided steps_used +m +1 <=p. So any multiply steps after the current state are considered in the BFS.

But after the last multiply in the BFS, any remaining steps can be filled with increments, which do not affect the product. So the product is valid even if steps_used is less than p. Therefore, all products generated in the BFS (i.e., products that have steps_used <=p) are valid, because the remaining steps (p - steps_used) can be filled with increments, which do not change the product.

Therefore, in the BFS, whenever we process a state (product, current_b, steps_used), we can immediately add the product to the possible a's if steps_used <=p. But wait, that's not correct. Because the steps_used is the steps taken to reach that product, but steps_used can be less than p. However, in that case, the remaining steps can be used for other operations that do not affect the product. But the product is generated by the steps taken up to steps_used steps. So the product is valid as long as steps_used <=p.

But for example, if a product is generated after s steps, then even if s <p, there are p -s steps left. But those steps can be filled with increments (operation 1), which do not change the product. So the a will remain the same. So the product is valid.

Therefore, in the BFS, whenever we have a state (product, current_b, steps_used), and steps_used <=p, then the product is a possible a.

But wait, the steps_used includes the steps taken to reach that product, but if steps_used is less than p, the user can choose not to perform any more multiplies, and just do increments. So the product remains the same, and the a is valid. So every product generated in the BFS is a possible a, and the steps_used can be <=p.

So during the BFS, whenever we process a state (product, current_b, steps_used), if steps_used <=p, then the product is added to the possible a's.

Therefore, the algorithm should collect all products generated during the BFS where steps_used <=p, and then count how many of them fall into [l, r].

But how to track all possible products. The problem is that the same product can be generated through different paths, but we need to count each product once, even if it's generated multiple times. So a set is needed to track all unique products.

So the steps are:

Initialize a queue with the initial state (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0).

Initialize a set of possible_a's.

For each state in the queue:

   if steps_used >p → skip.

   if product >=1 (which it always is) → add to possible_a's if steps_used <=p.

   then, generate all possible m increments followed by a multiply:

      for m in 0 to (p - steps_used -1):

          new_b = current_b + m

          new_product = product * new_b

          if new_product > r → skip (since even if multiplied further, it can't be <=r).

          new_steps = steps_used + m +1 (m increments plus 1 multiply step).

          if new_steps >p → skip.

          check if (new_product, new_b, new_steps) has been visited. If not, add to queue and mark as visited.

So, in code, we can model this as a BFS with a visited set. The visited set tracks (product, current_b, steps_used) to avoid revisiting the same state.

But even with that, the number of possible states may be manageable for p=100 and product up to 1e9.

But wait, for example, if product is 2, current_b is 2, steps_used is 3. Then, in the next step, m can be from 0 to (p -3 -1) = p-4. For p=100, m can be up to 96. For each m, new_b becomes 2 + m, new_product is 2*(2+m). But if m is 0 → new_product=4, steps_used=4. If m is 1 → product=6, steps_used=5, etc. But each new_product could be up to 2*(2+96) = 196, which is still within 1e9. So for each step, the new_product can be up to (sum of possible increments) times previous product. So if the product is already larger than r, we can prune that branch.

So during the BFS, whenever a new_product is generated that is larger than r, it is skipped. Because further multiplies would only make it larger, and thus it's not a candidate for the answer.

Therefore, pruning when new_product > r can significantly reduce the number of states.

Another important optimization is to track the visited states. For example, if two different paths reach the same product, current_b, and steps_used, there's no need to process them again. So the visited set will store tuples (product, current_b, steps_used), and when a new state is generated, it's checked against this set.

So putting this all together, the code would proceed with BFS, tracking the visited states, and adding valid products to the possible_a's set.

Once all states are processed, the possible_a's set is filtered to those between l and r (inclusive), and the count is output.

Let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input: 2 10 3.

The BFS starts with (1, 0, 0). Since steps_used=0 <=3, product 1 is added. But l is 2, so 1 is not counted. Then, possible m increments:

steps_used=0, so new_steps must be <=3.

m can be from 0 to (3 -0 -1) = 2.

So m=0: new_steps=0+0+1=1. new_b=0+0=0. new_product=1*0=0. But product becomes 0, which when multiplied in future steps remains 0. So possible_a includes 0, but it's below l=2. So this path is pruned.

Wait, but wait. The first multiply can't be done unless current_b is at least 1, because the initial state is (1, 0). So the first operation must be increment. So m0 must be at least 1. So in the first step, m can't be 0. Because after the initial state (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0), the first step must be m increments (m >=1) followed by a multiply. Otherwise, m=0 would mean that in the first multiply step, the product is 0, which is invalid (as after that, any further steps would leave a=0).

Wait, this is a problem with the initial approach. Because in the initial state (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0), when considering m=0, the new_b is 0, and the product becomes 0, which is invalid, but the code would generate that. However, according to the problem statement, the first operation must be an increment (operation 1), because the initial state has b=0, and the first operation cannot be a multiply (as that would set a to 0). But according to the problem statement, the user can perform any sequence of operations as long as the total steps are <=p. So if the user chooses to do a multiply first (operation 2), then a is 0, but this is allowed. However, the problem requires that the final a is x, which must be >=l. So a=0 would be considered only if l=0. But in the first example, l=2, so it's irrelevant.

But in the code's BFS, the initial state (product=1, steps_used=0) allows m=0. So after 0 increments and a multiply, new_steps=1, product=0. This is a valid state, but the product is 0. However, the code will add this to possible_a, but since l=2, it's not counted.

But in the first example, how does the code get the correct answer of 1? Let's see.

Let's walk through the first example.

Sample Input 1:

2 10 3.

The only possible x is 2.

The steps needed to reach 2 are:

First, m0=1 increments (steps:1), then multiply (step 2). a=1*1=1. Then, after that, m1=0 increments (so step 3 is multiply: a=1*1 (but that's same as before). Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the correct path is:

- First, increment once (steps_used=1). Then multiply (step 2). a=1*1=1. steps_used=2. Then, increment once (step3: steps_used=3). But this is after the multiply. So a remains 1. So this would not get 2.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to do two increments and a multiply. For example:

Steps:

1. Increment (steps=1, b=1).

2. Multiply (steps=2, a=1*1=1, b=1).

3. Increment (steps=3, b=2). Then, multiply (step4 exceeds p=3, so can't). So a remains 1. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps another path.

Wait, maybe the first example's solution is achieved by:

- 3 increments (steps 1,2,3) then multiply (step4 exceeds p=3). So no, can't.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

In 3 steps:

First, m0=2 increments (steps 1,2). Then multiply (step3). So a=1*2=2. steps_used=3. This is allowed.

So in the BFS, the initial state is (1,0,0). steps_used=0.

Then, m can be from 0 to (3-0-1)=2.

So possible m values are 0,1,2.

For m=2: new_steps=0+2+1=3. new_b=0+2=2. product=1*2=2. steps_used=3. This is added to the possible_a's. So in the code, this product would be added, and since 2 is between 2 and 10, it's counted. So the answer is 1.

But how does the BFS reach this path?

Let's see:

Processing the initial state (1,0,0). steps_used=0 <=3, so add 1 to possible_a's (but l=2, so not counted). Then, generate all m where 0 <=m <=2 (since steps_used +m +1 <=3 → m <=2).

For each m:

m=0: new_b=0, new_product=0. steps_used=1. So this state is (0, 0, 1). steps_used=1 <=3 → add 0 to possible_a's. Then, process this state. Now, for m in 0 to (3-1-1)=1. For each m:

m=0 → new_steps=1+0+1=2. new_b=0+0=0. product=0*0=0. steps_used=2. Add 0 to possible_a's. Then process this state. m can be 0 up to (3-2-1)=0. So m=0: new_steps=3, new_b=0, product=0. Add 0 to possible_a's. steps_used=3. Then, from that state, no more steps can be taken (3+ m+1 <=3 → m+1 <=0 → m=-1, invalid). So this path is unproductive.

m=1: steps_used=1, m=1. new_steps=1+1+1=3. new_b=0+1=1. product=0*1=0. steps_used=3. Add 0 to possible_a's.

Then, processing other possibilities.

But all paths where the initial multiply is 0 will have a product of 0, which is invalid for l=2.

Now, back to the initial state: m=1. So m=1:

new_steps=0 +1 +1=2. new_b=0+1=1. new_product=1*1=1. steps_used=2. So state is (1,1,2). steps_used=2 <=3 → add 1 to possible_a's.

Then, in this state, steps_used=2. So remaining steps is 1. So m can be from 0 to (3-2-1) =0. So m=0. new_steps=2+0+1=3. new_b=1+0=1. product=1*1=1. steps_used=3. Add 1 to possible_a's.

Then, processing this state: steps_used=3. So m can be 0, but steps_used +m +1 would be 4>3. So no more steps.

So the product 1 is added again.

Now, the initial state's m=2:

m=2: new_steps=0+2+1=3. new_b=0+2=2. product=1*2=2. steps_used=3. Add 2 to possible_a's. 2 is within [2,10], so counted. So the answer is 1.

Thus, the code would generate the correct answer.

So the BFS approach seems correct.

Now, the code needs to implement this BFS with pruning for product exceeding r, and tracking visited states.

Implementing this in Python:

We can use a deque for BFS, a set for visited states, and a set for possible_a's.

But to handle large values, we need to track product and current_b and steps_used.

So steps:

Initialize possible_a as a set.

Initialize deque with (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0).

Mark (1,0,0) as visited.

Then, process each state in the deque.

For each state:

   if steps_used >p → skip.

   if product is between l and r → add to possible_a.

   compute remaining_steps = p - steps_used.

   if remaining_steps <0 → skip.

   max_increments = remaining_steps -1 (since after increments, we need to do a multiply which takes 1 step).

   So the maximum m is max(0, max_increments). So m can be from 0 to max_increments.

   for m in 0 to max_increments:

      new_b = current_b + m.

      new_product = product * new_b.

      if new_product > r → skip.

      new_steps = steps_used + m +1.

      if new_steps >p → skip.

      check if (new_product, new_b, new_steps) is in visited. If not, add to deque and visited.

But wait, even if new_product is 0, it's allowed. Because steps_used is <=p.

But when new_product is zero, further steps can't generate anything else. But since l >=2, those would not be counted.

So the code can handle this.

But in Python, looping from m=0 to max_increments could be time-consuming if max_increments is large. For example, when steps_used is 0 and p=100, max_increments is 100-0-1=99. So m can be up to 99. For each state, we loop m from 0 to 99. But with BFS, and considering that product can quickly reach over r and be pruned, the total number of states is manageable.

But for p=100, and with each step allowing up to 100 increments, this could be a problem. Let's see.

But the key is that each state is processed once. So for each state (product, current_b, steps_used), the code tries all possible m's (0 to max_increments) for that state. However, if the product is already larger than r, then new_product will be even larger, and thus pruned. So the code will quickly skip those.

So the code should be efficient enough.

Now, let's code this.

But wait, in the initial state, steps_used is 0. So possible_a includes product=1 (steps_used=0). But according to the problem statement, the first cell starts at 1, but the steps can be zero. So in the case where p=0 steps, the a would be 1. But according to the problem's input constraints, l >=2. So this would not be counted. But the code would correctly ignore it.

In the code, when processing the initial state (1,0,0), steps_used=0 <=p. So the product 1 is added to possible_a. But since l is >=2, it's not included in the answer. So the code would work.

Now, code:

Implement BFS with a deque. Possible steps:

- Read l, r, p.

- Initialize possible_a = set()

- Initialize deque with (product=1, current_b=0, steps_used=0)

- visited = set containing (1, 0, 0)

- While deque not empty:

   state = deque.popleft()

   product, current_b, steps_used = state

   if steps_used > p: continue

   if product >= l and product <= r:

      possible_a.add(product)

   remaining_steps = p - steps_used

   if remaining_steps <0:

      continue

   max_increments = remaining_steps -1

   if max_increments <0:

      # can't do any multiply after increments

      continue

   for m in 0..max_increments:

      new_b = current_b + m

      new_product = product * new_b

      if new_product > r:

          continue

      new_steps = steps_used + m +1

      if new_steps >p:

          continue

      new_state = (new_product, new_b, new_steps)

      if new_state not in visited:

          visited.add(new_state)

          deque.append(new_state)

- Finally, count the number of elements in possible_a.

But wait, this would iterate m from 0 to max_increments. For large max_increments (like 99), this could be slow. Because for each state, we're looping m=0 to 99, and for each m, creating a new state.

But given that the product could quickly become larger than r, which would skip processing, this may be manageable.

But there's a way to optimize this. Since in each state, the m is the number of increments before a multiply. The new_b is current_b + m, and new_product is product * (current_b + m). So for a given state (product, current_b, steps_used), the new_product is product * (current_b + m), for m ranging from 0 to max_increments. So for each possible m, the new_product is product multiplied by (current_b + m). But if product is already 0, then new_product remains 0, and we can skip processing further steps (since any further multiply will keep it 0). But since l >=2, those are not counted. So the code can handle this.

But for m in 0 to max_increments, the loop could be optimized. For example, when current_b is zero (initial state), and product is 1, m can be 0, which leads to new_product=0, but if l=2, that's not useful. So the code must process all m's.

But in Python, loops over 100 elements are not a big deal, even if done multiple times.

Now, code:

But wait, the code must read l, r, p. Then process as above.

But when steps_used is <=p, the product is added to possible_a. So in the code:

In each state processing:

if steps_used <=p:

   if product is between l and r:

      add to possible_a.

So the code would process all such states.

Now, testing the first example:

Sample Input 1: 2 10 3.

The possible_a's would include 2 (from m=2 in the initial state), which is the only value between 2 and 10.

Thus, the code's output is 1.

Sample Input 2: 2 111 100.

The output is 106. So the code must generate 106 numbers between 2 and 111.

The code would generate all possible products that can be formed with up to 100 steps, which would include many numbers. But with the BFS approach and pruning, it should work.

Now, the code.

But we need to handle large products. For example, multiplying many terms could result in numbers up to 1e9. But since we check if new_product > r before adding to the queue, it's okay.

Now, code:

We need to read l, r, p from input.

Then, perform BFS as described.

Implementing this in Python:

But note that in Python, tuples are hashable and can be added to a set. So visited can be a set of tuples (product, current_b, steps_used).

But for performance, it's important to use a deque (from collections import deque) for BFS.

Now, the code:

Read input:

l, r, p = map(int, input().split())

Initialize possible_a as a set.

visited as a set.

deque for BFS.

Now, the code:

from collections import deque

l, r, p = map(int, input().split())

possible = set()
visited = set()

initial_product = 1
initial_b = 0
initial_steps = 0

queue = deque([(initial_product, initial_b, initial_steps)])
visited.add( (initial_product, initial_b, initial_steps) )

while queue:
    product, current_b, steps_used = queue.popleft()
    
    if steps_used <= p:
        if l <= product <= r:
            possible.add(product)
    
    if steps_used >= p:
        continue
    
    remaining = p - steps_used
    max_m = remaining -1  # steps_used + m +1 <= p → m <= remaining -1
    if max_m <0:
        continue
    
    # m can be from 0 to max_m
    for m in range(0, max_m +1):
        new_b = current_b + m
        new_product = product * new_b
        if new_product > r:
            continue
        
        new_steps = steps_used + m +1
        new_state = (new_product, new_b, new_steps)
        if new_state not in visited:
            visited.add(new_state)
            queue.append(new_state)

print(len(possible))

But wait, this code may not process all possibilities. For example, after generating a product, steps_used may be less than p, and the remaining steps can be filled with increments. But the product remains the same. So in the code, the product is added to possible only once, when steps_used is <=p.

Wait, no. The code adds the product to possible if steps_used <=p. So for example, if a product is generated with steps_used=2 and p=3, and then there's another step_used=3 with the same product, it would be added again, but since possible is a set, it's stored once.

So the code should collect all possible products that can be generated with steps_used <=p.

But in the code, the check for adding to possible is done once per state. But the same product can be generated through different paths (different states), but it's added to the set once.

Thus, the code should correctly count all possible x in [l, r] that can be generated in at most p steps.

But there's a possible error in the code: when steps_used is <=p, but the product is already added. For example, if a product is generated with steps_used=2 (p=3), and then again with steps_used=3, but since it's the same product, it's added only once.

Yes, because the possible is a set.

Testing this code with sample input 1:

Sample Input 1:

2 10 3 → output 1.

Let's see:

The code's queue starts with (1,0,0).

Processing (1,0,0):

steps_used=0 <=3. product=1 is added to possible if between 2 and 10. Not added.

remaining steps=3. max_m=3-0-1=2.

So m can be 0,1,2.

For m=0:

new_b=0. new_product=0. new_steps=1. add to queue.

For m=1:

new_b=1. new_product=1. steps_used=0+1+1=2. new_state (1,1,2).

For m=2:

new_b=2. new_product=2. steps_used=3. new_state (2,2,3).

Then, when processing (0,0,1):

steps_used=1 <=3. product=0 not in [2,10]. So not added.

remaining steps=3-1=2. max_m=2-1=1.

m can be 0,1.

new_b=0+0=0. new_product=0*0=0. steps_used=2. added.

...

But all these paths generate 0, which is not in the desired range.

When processing (1,1,2):

steps_used=2 <=3. product=1 not in [2,10].

remaining steps=3-2=1. max_m=0.

m=0:

new_b=1+0=1. new_product=1*1=1. steps_used=3. added. product is 1, not in range.

When processing (2,2,3):

steps_used=3 <=3. product=2 is in range → added to possible.

So possible now has 2. So the answer is 1.

Sample input 2:

2 111 100 → output 106.

Sample input 3:

2 111 11 → output 47.

The code should handle these correctly.

Now, the code needs to handle the case where steps_used <p, but after the multiply, there are remaining steps. For example, steps_used=5, p=10. After multiply, steps_used=6. Remaining steps 4 can be filled with increments, which do not affect the product. So the product is added to possible.

So the code's approach of adding the product to possible whenever steps_used <=p is correct.

Thus, the code should work correctly.
