<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasya wants to erase the minimum number of measurements so that the remaining ones have their max and min differing by no more than two times. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says that after removing some elements, the maximum should be at most twice the minimum. And we need to find the minimal number of elements to remove, which is equivalent to finding the largest possible subset where this condition holds, then subtracting its size from n.

So the key is to find the largest possible subset where for all elements x in the subset, x is between min and 2*min. Wait, but wait: the min of the subset is x_min, and the max is x_max. The condition is x_max <= 2 * x_min. So the subset must have all elements >= x_min and <= 2*x_min.

But how do we choose x_min? Because if we fix x_min as the smallest element in the subset, then all elements must be <= 2*x_min. So the largest possible subset would be the one where x_min is as small as possible, but allows as many elements as possible to be <= 2*x_min.

Alternatively, perhaps we can sort the list of measurements, and then for each possible x as the minimum in the subset, find how many elements in the sorted list are <= 2x, starting from x. Then the maximum count of such elements would give the minimal removals.

Wait, let's think. Suppose we sort the array in non-decreasing order. Then, for each element in the array (let's say at position i), we can consider this element as the minimum of the subset. Then, the maximum allowed in the subset is 2*arr[i]. Since the array is sorted, all elements after i (including i) are >= arr[i]. So, we need to find the largest j such that arr[j] <= 2*arr[i]. The number of elements from i to j (inclusive) is j - i + 1. We can then find for each i the maximum j where this condition holds, and track the maximum count. The answer would be n minus this maximum count.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the sorted array allows us to efficiently find the range where elements are between arr[i] and 2*arr[i], given that arr[i] is the minimum. Since the array is sorted, once we find j for each i, we can compute the maximum possible size of the subset.

So the steps would be:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. For each i from 0 to n-1, find the maximum j where arr[j] <= 2*arr[i]. The elements from i to j form a valid subset.
3. The maximum count of such elements (j -i +1) across all i is the largest subset possible. The answer is n minus this maximum count.

Now, how to efficiently find j for each i?

Since the array is sorted, we can use binary search for each i. For each i, the upper bound is 2*arr[i], and we need to find the largest index j where arr[j] <= 2*arr[i]. The binary search would take O(log n) time per i. Since n can be up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n log n), which should be acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Sort the array.
- For each i in 0..n-1:
   - Use binary search to find the largest j where arr[j] <= 2*arr[i].
   - The count is j - i +1.
   - Keep track of the maximum count.
- The minimal removal is n - max_count.

Let's test this with the examples.

First example:

Input array is [4,5,3,8,3,7]. When sorted, it becomes [3,3,4,5,7,8].

Now, for each i:

i=0 (3): 2*3=6. The elements <=6 are up to 5 (value 7 is 7>6). Wait, sorted array is 3,3,4,5,7,8. So 2*3=6. The largest element <=6 is 5 (index 3). So j=3. Count is 3-0+1=4. So possible subset size is 4. Which matches the first example's solution where 6-2=4 elements remain.

But according to the example, the answer was 2. Which means 4 elements are kept, so the maximum count is 4, and 6-4=2. So yes, that would be correct.

Another example: input is [4,3,2,4]. Sorted becomes [2,3,4,4]. For each i:

i=0: 2*2=4. Find j where elements <=4. All elements are <=4. j=3. count 4-0+1=4. So possible subset size is 4. So answer is 0, which matches the example.

So the approach works for these cases.

Now, how to implement this in Python efficiently.

In Python, the bisect module can help. For each i, we can compute the rightmost index where arr[j] <= 2 * arr[i]. Using bisect_right. But since the array is sorted, we can perform a bisect_right for 2*arr[i]. However, since the array is sorted, the bisect_right would give the insertion point, which is the first element larger than 2*arr[i], so j is the index before that.

But wait, arr is sorted in non-decreasing order. For each i, the elements >= arr[i], so the elements from i onwards. So for each i, we can only consider elements from i onwards. So when we perform the binary search, we need to find the largest j >= i where arr[j] <= 2*arr[i].

So the binary search should be done on the subarray starting from i to end. Therefore, the bisect_right can be called with lo=i. For example, in the sorted array, for each i, we find the rightmost index j in the entire array where arr[j] <= 2 * arr[i], and j >=i.

So in Python:

from bisect import bisect_right

sorted_arr = sorted(c)

max_count = 0

for i in range(len(sorted_arr)):

    target = 2 * sorted_arr[i]

    j = bisect_right(sorted_arr, target, lo=i) - 1

    # since bisect_right returns the insertion point, the elements before are <= target.

    current_count = j - i + 1

    if current_count > max_count:

        max_count = current_count

result = n - max_count

So this should work.

But wait, the bisect_right returns the insertion point, which is the first element greater than the target. So the elements before that insertion point are <= target. So the maximum j is insertion_point -1.

But we have to make sure that the insertion_point is within the array. For example, if all elements are <= target, then bisect_right returns len(arr), and j is len(arr)-1.

Yes.

But also, since we start the search from lo=i, bisect_right starts looking from index i onwards. So the j will be >=i.

So this code should correctly find the maximum j >=i where arr[j] <= 2*arr[i].

Testing with the first example:

sorted_arr is [3,3,4,5,7,8]

For i=0 (3):

target is 6. bisect_right looks for 6 in the array starting from index 0. The elements are 3,3,4,5,7,8. The insertion point would be 4 (since 7 is the first element >6). So j is 4-1=3. current_count is 3-0 +1=4.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

Another test case: the second example.

sorted_arr is [2,3,4,4]. For i=0, target is 4. bisect_right finds the insertion point for 4 starting from i=0. The array is 2,3,4,4. The insertion point after the last 4 is 4. So j is 3. current_count is 4. Which is correct.

Another test case: what if all elements are the same?

For example, n=5, [5,5,5,5,5]. Then for each i, target is 10. All elements are <=10. So j is 4, current_count is 5 -i +1. The maximum is 5 (when i=0). So answer is 5-5=0.

Another case: n=2, elements 1 and 3. sorted is [1,3]. For i=0: target is 2. The elements <=2 are 1. So j=0. current_count 1. For i=1: target 6. j=1. count 1. So the maximum is 1. Answer is 2-1=1. Which makes sense because we can only keep one element (either 1 or 3, since 3 is 3 times 1, which is more than two times).

So this approach works.

Now, what about the time complexity? Sorting is O(n log n). Then for each of the n elements, we perform a binary search which is O(log n). So total time is O(n log n + n log n) = O(n log n), which for n=1e5 is acceptable.

In Python, this should work within the time constraints.

Now, let's think about possible optimizations.

The sorted array is needed. So the first step is to sort the list.

But in Python, the bisect module's bisect_right function is O(log n) per call. So for n=1e5, the total operations would be around 1e5 * 20 (log2(1e5) is ~17) = 2e6 operations, which is manageable.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Read the list of integers.

Sort them.

Initialize max_count to 0.

Loop over each index i in the sorted list.

For each i, compute target as 2*arr[i].

Use bisect_right to find the insertion point of target in the array starting from i.

j is insertion_point -1.

current_count = j - i +1.

Update max_count if current_count is larger.

At the end, output n - max_count.

Now, code.

But in Python, the bisect module's bisect_right function can take a lo parameter. So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import bisect


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    c = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    c.sort()

    max_size = 0

    for i in range(n):

        target = 2 * c[i]

        j = bisect.bisect_right(c, target, i) -1

        current_size = j - i +1

        if current_size > max_size:

            max_size = current_size

    print(n - max_size, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')

    test()

target=6 again. bisect_right starts at i=1. The elements are 3,4,5,7,8 (starting from index 1). Wait, no. The entire array is [3,3,4,5,7,8]. Starting from index 1, the elements are 3,4,5,7,8. Wait, no: the list is the same. So for i=1, the elements from i onwards are 3,4,5,7,8. So target is 6 again. bisect_right(c,6,1) would look from index 1. The elements are 3,4,5,7,8. Wait, no, the entire array is the same. So when you start at i=1, the elements are [3,4,5,7,8], but wait, no. The original array after i=1 is the same as before. So for i=1, the element is 3. So target is 6 again. The elements starting from index 1 are 3,4,5,7,8. Wait, the original array is [3,3,4,5,7,8]. So the elements from index 1 are 3 (index 1), 4,5,7,8. So when we look for 6 starting at i=1, the bisect_right would find that the insertion point is 4 (since the elements at indices 1,2,3 are 3,4,5, which are <=6. Then 7 is at index 4 (since the list starts from i=1, the indices in the list are 1,2,3,4,5. Wait, no. The bisect_right function in Python uses the lo and hi parameters to specify the range. So when we call bisect.bisect_right(c, target, i), that's equivalent to looking in the slice c[i:hi], but since hi is not provided, it's up to len(c). So in the first example, for i=1, the target is 6. The elements from index 1 onwards are [3,4,5,7,8]. bisect_right for 6 in this subarray is the first position where elements are >6. The elements are 3,4,5,7,8. The 7 is the first element >6, which is at index 3 in the subarray. But in the original array, that's index 1+3=4. So the insertion point is 4. So j=4-1=3. current_size is 3-1+1=3. Which is 3 elements (indices 1,2,3: 3,4,5). So the subset size is 3, which is smaller than the previous 4.

But perhaps there's a better i where the subset is larger.

Wait, perhaps when i=2 (element 4), target is 8. bisect_right in the array starting at i=2. The elements from 2 are 4,5,7,8. The insertion point for 8 is 4 (since all elements up to index 5 (original array) are <=8. So j is 5-1=5. current_size is 5-2+1=4. So subset size is 4 again.

So this would be another possible subset. So the maximum count is 4, which is correct.

So the code would capture that.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Another test case: n=2, [1,3]. After sorting [1,3]. For i=0: target 2. bisect_right returns 1 (since 3 is >2). j=0. current_size 1. For i=1: target 6. j=1. current_size 1. So maximum is 1. Answer is 2-1=1.

Which is correct.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, edge cases. What if all elements are 5000. Then 2*5000 is 10000, which is larger than any element (since all are 5000). So for each i, j is n-1. So the maximum subset size is n. So answer is 0. Which is correct.

Another edge case: n=1e5, all elements 1. The code runs quickly, sorted is O(n log n), but since all elements are same, for each i, j is n-1, so current_size is n -i. The maximum is n (for i=0). So answer is 0.

Another case: elements sorted as [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]. For each element, the maximum j is when i is such that 2*arr[i] is as large as possible. For example, for i=0 (1), target 2. The elements <=2 are 1,2. So j=1. current_size 2. For i=1 (2), target 4. elements up to 4. j=2. current_size 2. For i=2 (4), j=3 (8 is 8>8? Wait, 2*4=8. So j=3 (element 8 is allowed). So current_size is 2 (elements 4 and 8). Wait, no: 8 is 2*4. So j=3. 3-2+1=2. So subset size is 2. So in this case, the maximum subset size is 2. So answer is n-2. For example, if n=5, then answer is 3.

So code works.

Thus, the code seems correct.

n = int(input())

    j = bisect.bisect_right(c, target, i) - 1
    current_size = j - i + 1

        max_size = current_size
