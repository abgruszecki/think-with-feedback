Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the game is between Petya and Gena, taking turns to remove k stickers from the left (k >=2) and replace them with their sum. The game ends when there's one sticker left. The score is the sum of all the sums they took, and we need to find the difference between Petya's and Gena's scores when both play optimally.

Hmm. The key here is that each move's choice of k affects the remaining stickers and the subsequent moves. The goal is to maximize the difference between your total and the opponent's. So, this feels like a dynamic programming problem where the state represents the current subarray and whose turn it is. But given the constraints of n up to 200,000, a standard DP approach with O(n^2) time is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the problem structure. Each move takes the first k stickers and replaces them with their sum. So the next state is the new array: sum of first k, followed by the remaining stickers. The sum added to the player's score is that sum. So the player's choice of k determines their immediate gain and the structure of the remaining game.

But considering that the sum is part of the player's score, perhaps there's a way to model this using prefix sums and some recurrence.

Wait, let's think of it in terms of prefixes. Suppose we have a prefix sum array S where S[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, when a player takes k elements, the sum added is S[k], and the next state is a new array where the first element is S[k], followed by the elements from k+1 onwards.

But the problem is that after the first move, the array changes. So the next state's array is [sum, a_k+1, ..., a_n]. Then, the next player takes some k' elements starting from the left. But the sum in the next step would be the sum of the first k' elements of this new array. Which includes the previous sum.

This seems complicated. However, maybe we can model the game recursively by considering the current array as a sequence, and for each possible move, compute the optimal difference between the current player's score and the opponent's.

Let's denote dp[i] as the maximum difference the current player can achieve when considering the first i elements. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Suppose the current array is [x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]. The current player can choose k (from 2 to m). They take the first k elements, sum them (sum = x_1 + ... + x_k), and their score increases by sum. Then the array becomes [sum, x_{k+1}, ..., x_m]. The next player will make their move, and the difference for the current player is sum (their gain) minus whatever the next player's optimal difference is. Because the next player's optimal play would maximize their own difference, which is equivalent to subtracting from the current player's total.

So for the current state (array), the optimal choice is the maximum over all possible k of (sum_k) minus the optimal value of the resulting array. Because the next player's optimal difference is subtracted from the current player's gain.

But how can we model this for large n? Because each state is the entire array, which is impossible for n up to 2e5.

Hmm. Let's look for patterns or a way to model this with a linear DP approach.

Wait, maybe the order of the elements after the first sum is merged. Let's think about the process. Each time a player picks k elements, the first k are replaced by their sum. So the next array is [sum_k, x_{k+1}, x_{k+2}, ..., x_m]. Then, the next move can take k' elements from this array. But any k' chosen would merge some elements from the sum and the following elements.

But perhaps there's a way to model this using a prefix sum array and some mathematical recurrence.

Alternatively, let's consider that all moves are merging prefixes. Let's see:

The initial array is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

When the first player takes k1 elements, the array becomes [S1, a_{k1+1}, ..., a_n], where S1 is sum(a_1..a_k1).

Then the next player takes k2 elements from this new array. So if k2 is 2, they take S1 and a_{k1+1}, sum to S1 + a_{k1+1} = S1 + a_{k1+1} = sum(a_1..a_{k1+1}).

Wait, that's interesting. So when a player takes k elements from the current array, the sum is the sum of the first k elements of the current array, which is equivalent to the sum of the original elements up to some position.

Wait, perhaps all possible moves can be represented as merging prefixes of the original array. Because each time you merge a prefix, the new sum becomes part of the next array's prefix. So, for example, merging the first k1 elements in the first step, then merging the first k2 elements in the new array (which would be equivalent to merging the first k1 + k2 -1 elements of the original array? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps each move's sum is equivalent to a prefix sum of the original array. Let's see:

Suppose the initial array is a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4. Suppose first player takes k=3. Then the new array is [sum(a_1+a_2+a_3), a_4]. The next player takes k=2, which sums sum(a_1+a_2+a_3) + a_4, which is sum(a_1..a_4). So the total sum in this case is the sum of all elements. But each move's sum is a prefix sum of the original array. Wait, in this case, the first sum is sum of the first 3, then the next sum is sum of first 4. So the total sum for the two players is 3 elements sum (player 1) and sum of all 4 (player 2). But the initial array's sum is sum(a_1..a_4), so the two players' sums add up to (sum3) + (sum4) = sum4 + sum3. Which is more than sum4. So that's possible only when the initial array has negative elements. Wait, but in the problem statement, the sample input 2 shows that the sum can be negative.

But perhaps the key insight here is that each move's sum is a prefix sum of the original array. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

If the initial array is a1, a2, a3, a4.

First move: take k=2. Sum is a1+a2. The new array is [s1, a3, a4].

Second move: take k=3. Sum is s1 + a3 + a4 = a1+a2 +a3 +a4. So in this case, the sum is the total sum. But the original array's sum is the same. So in this case, the sum added to the second player's score is the total sum, but the first player's sum is s1.

But the sum added at each step is a prefix of the current array, which may be a combination of previous merges. So perhaps the sum added in each move is the sum of a certain subset of the original array's elements. But modeling that seems difficult.

Alternative approach: let's model the problem as a game where each merge operation combines some elements into a single element, and the sum of the merged elements is added to the player's score. The goal is to choose the merges such that the players' difference is maximized.

But how to model this efficiently?

Another thought: the game is equivalent to partitioning the array into some groups, where each group is a consecutive starting from the left, and each group has size at least 2. Then, the players take turns choosing the next group. The players' scores are the sum of their groups, and the difference is (sum of Petya's groups) minus (sum of Gena's groups).

Wait, but the order in which the groups are formed matters because each merge affects the next possible merges. For example, after merging the first k elements, the next merge can merge the new sum with some of the remaining elements. So the grouping is not fixed but depends on the moves chosen.

But perhaps the key is that each merge operation adds a new element to the left of the array, which is a sum of some previous elements. So the problem reduces to merging prefixes in a way that the sum of each merge is part of the player's score. The challenge is to model the optimal choices for both players.

Let's think recursively. For a given array, the current player can choose any k >=2. For each possible k, compute the sum of the first k elements (s), then the next state is the array [s] + remaining elements. The current player's gain is s, and the next player's gain will be determined by their optimal play on the new array. The total difference for the current player is s (their gain) minus the next player's optimal difference (since the next player's difference is their own gain minus the next player after them, and so on).

But for large n, this recursive approach is not feasible. So we need a way to model this with dynamic programming, but in O(n) or O(n^2) time, which for n=2e5 would require O(n) time.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a prefix sum-based dynamic programming approach.

Let's denote the prefix sums of the original array. Let's compute the prefix sum array S, where S[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, when a player takes k elements from the current array (which is built from merging steps), their sum is the sum of the first k elements of the current array. However, the current array is a result of previous merges, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps all possible moves can be represented as selecting some indices in the original array. For example, each merge corresponds to grouping the first x elements of the original array into a sum, then the next merge groups some elements after that. Wait, but this is not necessarily the case. Because after merging, the new sum is part of the array and can be merged again.

But perhaps the optimal strategy can be determined by considering the prefix sums of the original array. Let me think of a small example.

Take the first sample input:

3
2 4 8

The prefix sums are S[1]=2, S[2]=6, S[3]=14.

Petya can take all 3 elements. Sum is S[3] =14. Then the game ends. So difference is 14-0=14.

Another possibility: Petya takes 2 elements (sum 6), array becomes [6,8]. Then Gena can take 2 elements (sum 14). Difference would be 6-14= -8. So Petya would choose to take all elements.

So the optimal play is to take the largest possible sum that gives the best difference.

But how to model this for any array?

Alternative idea: let's model the problem using the original array's prefix sums and a dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the maximum difference a player can achieve when the current game starts with the first i elements (from the original array) being merged into a single element, and the remaining elements are as per the original array. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think of dp[i] as the optimal difference a player can achieve when considering the subarray starting at position i.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a game where the players are choosing split points in the array. Let's see: when a player takes k elements from the left, they are effectively choosing to split at position k. But after that, the array is modified, so the next split is on the new array. But this is not directly a split in the original array.

Another approach: Since each move merges the first k elements into a sum, the game can be viewed as a sequence of merges, each time merging the first k elements. The sum of each merge is added to the player's score. The key is to choose these k's such that the players alternate, and the sum difference is maximized.

But the problem is to find the optimal sequence of merges. The total number of merges is until there's one element left. For example, if n=3, then after two merges (each taking two elements), but in the sample, the first player takes all three elements and the game ends.

Wait, no. The first player takes k elements (k>=2), and then the array size is m - k + 1. So for m=3, taking k=3 leaves m=1, so the game ends. So the first player can take all three elements, and that's their only move.

So the game can end in a single move if the first player takes all elements (if possible, i.e., n >=2).

So the process is:

- For each move, the player takes k elements (>=2) from the start of the array, replaces them with their sum. The sum is added to their score. The game continues with the new array until only one element remains.

We need to model this process optimally for both players.

Let's model the problem with DP. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum difference between the current player's score and the opponent's when the current array starts at position i of the original array (assuming that all elements before i have been merged into some sum).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the array can be in a state where some merges have been done, leading to a certain configuration. But how to model this efficiently?

Alternatively, let's consider that the game can be represented as a series of splits. Each time a player takes k elements (from the current array's left), the sum of those elements is added to their score. The remaining elements are the merged sum followed by the rest of the array. But this seems difficult to model.

Wait, but perhaps the order in which elements are merged can be represented by a certain structure. Let's think of the array as a list of elements, and each merge combines the first few elements into a sum. The process is such that the first element of the array is always the sum of some merged elements. So the array can be represented as a list of merged sums followed by the original elements that haven't been merged yet.

But even so, for n up to 2e5, we need a way to model the optimal choice of k in O(n) time.

Another idea: the optimal choice for the current player is to choose the best possible k, considering that the next player will also play optimally. Let's model this with DP, where for each position i (the current leftmost element being part of a merged sum), we can compute the optimal difference.

Wait, maybe the problem can be viewed as selecting a sequence of split points in the original array, such that each split corresponds to taking a certain number of elements. Each split must be after the previous split.

For example, the first split is at position k1, which merges a_1 to a_k1. The next split is at position k2 in the new array, which would be k2 elements after the merged sum. But since the new array after the first split is [sum1, a_{k1+1}, ..., a_n], the next split would take some number of elements starting from sum1. So the second split could be taking 2 elements (sum1 and a_{k1+1}), which would correspond to merging the first two elements of the new array, leading to sum1 + a_{k1+1} = sum of a_1 to a_{k1} + a_{k1+1} = sum of a_1 to a_{k1+1}.

So in this case, the split points are cumulative. The first split is at k1, the second split is k1+1, etc. So the splits form a sequence of positions in the original array.

Wait, maybe this is the key. Each merge operation corresponds to a split at some position in the original array. For example, the first merge is splitting after position k1, merging a_1..a_k1. The next merge is splitting after position k2 in the new array, which would correspond to a split after (k1) + (k2 -1) elements in the original array (since the new array's first element is sum of a_1..a_k1, followed by a_{k1+1}..a_n). So taking k2 elements from the new array would take the sum of the first k2 elements of the new array. Which could be sum1 + sum of a_{k1+1}..a_{k1 + k2 -1}.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, let's think that the entire game can be represented by a sequence of splits in the original array, where each split is after position t_i, and the splits are ordered in such a way that each split comes after the previous one. For example, the first split is after t1, merging a_1..t1. The second split is after t2, merging the sum of a_1..t1 and a_{t1+1}..t2, etc. But this might not capture all possibilities.

Alternatively, each time a merge is done, the current array is modified, but all merges are of the form of taking the first k elements. Thus, the sequence of merges can be represented as a list of k's, such that after each merge, the array size decreases by (k-1). For example, initial size is n. After first k1, the size is n -k1 + 1. Then next k2 is >=2, and the size after that is (n -k1 +1) -k2 +1 = n -k1 -k2 +2. And this continues until the size is 1.

But the problem is that the sum added at each step depends on the elements merged, which may have been merged in previous steps. However, the sum added in the first merge is sum(a_1..a_k1). The sum added in the next merge is sum( sum(a_1..a_k1), a_{k1+1}, ..., a_{k1 + k2 -1} ) = sum(a_1..a_{k1 + k2 -1}).

Wait, that's a key insight! Because when you merge the first k1 elements, their sum is S1 = sum(a_1..a_k1). Then, the next merge could be taking k2 elements from the new array. The first element is S1, and the next elements are a_{k1+1}, ..., a_n. So if the next merge takes 2 elements, the sum would be S1 + a_{k1+1} = sum(a_1..a_{k1+1}).

Similarly, if the next merge takes 3 elements, the sum would be S1 + a_{k1+1} + a_{k1+2} = sum(a_1..a_{k1+2}).

So, in general, each merge's sum is the sum of a consecutive range in the original array, starting from a_1 up to some position. For example:

- The first merge's sum is sum(a_1..a_k1) → which is a prefix sum up to k1.
- The next merge's sum is sum(a_1..a_{k1 + k2 -1}).
- And so on.

Therefore, each merge step corresponds to taking a prefix of the original array. The merge steps form a sequence of prefixes where each prefix is longer than the previous one.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see. Suppose the first merge is k1=2: sum(a1 + a2). The new array is [a1+a2, a3, a4]. The next merge is k2=3: sum of (a1+a2) + a3 + a4 = sum a1..a4. So this corresponds to a prefix of 4 elements in the original array.

Another example: first merge k1=3 (sum a1..a3). New array is [sum1, a4, a5]. Next merge k2=2: sum of sum1 + a4 = a1+a2+a3 +a4 = sum a1..a4. So again, this is a prefix of the original array.

So every merge step's sum is the sum of a prefix of the original array. Therefore, the total sum added by all merges is the sum of certain prefixes of the original array. But the order in which these prefixes are taken depends on the players' choices, and each prefix must be longer than the previous one.

Wait, not necessarily. For example, first merge could be k1=3 (sum a1..a3). Then the next merge could be k2=2 (sum a1..a4). Then another merge could be k3=2 (sum a1..a5). So the prefixes are 3, 4, 5, etc. Each prefix is longer than the previous.

But what if the next merge is of k2=1? No, because k must be at least 2. So each merge must take at least two elements, which in terms of the original array's prefix, each merge's prefix is longer than the previous.

Wait, no. Let's see. The first merge is sum a1..a3 (k1=3). The new array is [sum1, a4, a5]. Then, the next player can choose k2=2. That would take sum1 and a4, which is sum a1..a3 + a4 = sum a1..a4. So the next prefix is 4 elements. So the next prefix is longer than the previous (3 elements).

Another example: first merge k1=2 (sum a1+a2). New array is [sum1, a3, a4, a5]. Next merge k2=2: sum1 + a3 → sum a1..a3. So prefix length is 3, which is longer than the previous prefix (2).

So each merge corresponds to a prefix of the original array that is longer than the previous one. Therefore, the sequence of merges must form a strictly increasing sequence of prefix lengths.

But wait, if the first merge is k1=2 (sum a1+a2). Next merge is k2=3: sum (sum1) + a3 + a4 (but the new array is [sum1, a3, a4, a5]. So k2=3 would take sum1 + a3 + a4 = sum a1..a2 + a3 +a4 = sum a1..a4. So prefix length is 4. Which is longer than 2.

So yes, each merge's prefix is longer than the previous. Therefore, the entire game can be viewed as a sequence of prefixes of the original array, where each subsequent prefix is longer than the previous. The players take turns choosing the next prefix length, and the sum of each prefix is added to the current player's score. The game ends when the next prefix would cover all elements (since merging all elements would end the game).

Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a sequence of positions 1 < p1 < p2 < ... < pt = n such that each p_i is the sum of the first p_i elements. Each player alternately chooses the next p_i (which must be larger than the previous), and the sum s_i (sum of a_1..a_p_i) is added to their score. The difference between Petya's and Gena's scores is the total of s_i multiplied by 1 or -1 based on the turn.

But how to model this? Because each choice of p_i affects the subsequent choices. The problem is to choose the sequence of p_i's such that the difference is maximized.

But even with this model, for n up to 2e5, we need a way to compute the optimal choice efficiently.

Another observation: the sum of the entire array is fixed. Each merge's sum is a prefix sum of the original array. So the sum of all merge steps' sums is equal to the sum of all prefixes chosen in the sequence. For example, if the sequence is p1, p2, ..., pt, then the sum of all merge sums is S[p1] + S[p2] + ... + S[pt], where S is the prefix sum array.

But the players alternate taking these sums, with Petya taking the first, third, etc., and Gena the second, fourth, etc. So the difference is (sum of Petya's terms) - (sum of Gena's terms) = sum_{i} (s_i * (-1)^(i-1))).

Wait, yes. Because for each term s_i, if i is odd (Petya's turn), it's added to Petya's score. Gena's terms are added to his score. The difference is (sum of odd terms) - (sum of even terms) = sum (s_1 - s_2 + s_3 - s_4 + ... ).

But how does this relate to the problem? Because the sequence of prefixes must be increasing, and each step must be chosen optimally to maximize this difference.

So the problem is now: select a sequence of prefixes p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_t = n, where each step is chosen by the current player (starting with Petya), and each step must add a new p_i greater than the previous. The goal is to maximize the alternating sum of S[p_i] (sum_{i} S[p_i] * (-1)^(i+1)).

But how to compute this maximum value?

Let's model this with dynamic programming. For each position i in the original array, we can keep track of the maximum possible difference that can be achieved if the current merge ends at i, and it's the current player's turn to choose the next merge.

But given that the sequence must be strictly increasing, the next merge's p must be greater than i. So for each i, we can precompute the best possible choice for the next player.

Let's define dp[i] as the maximum difference (current player's score minus the opponent's) achievable when the last merge ends at position i (i.e., the next merge must start from i+1). Wait, but since each merge is a prefix, the next merge must start from position 1 (since each merge is a prefix of the original array). Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the merges are prefixes of the original array. So the sequence of prefixes must be increasing in length. For example, the first merge is of length k1 (a prefix), the next merge is of length k2 > k1 (another prefix), and so on. So after each merge, the next merge must take a longer prefix. Wait, no. Because after a merge, the array is modified. For example, if the first merge takes k1=2 elements (sum a1+a2), the new array is [s1, a3, a4]. Then the next merge could take k2=2 elements (s1 + a3), which is a sum of a1+a2+a3. So the prefix here is length 3. So the next merge's prefix is longer than the first merge's prefix (k1=2, k2=3). So each subsequent merge's prefix must be longer than the previous one. Because each merge takes a prefix of the current array, which is a sum of a longer prefix of the original array.

So the sequence of merges in terms of the original array's prefixes is a sequence of positions p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_t =n, where each p_i is the end of the prefix merged in step i.

So the problem reduces to selecting such a sequence, and the difference is the sum of S[p_1] - S[p_2] + S[p_3] - ... etc.

The challenge is to find the maximum possible difference.

Now, how to model this with dynamic programming. Let's think of the DP state as the current position up to which the last merge was done. For example, dp[i] represents the maximum difference that can be achieved if the last merge ended at position i. Then, for each i, the next merge can be any j >i, and the player's choice is to select j and add S[j] - dp[j] (since the next player will then choose optimally, and the current player's gain is S[j] minus the next player's optimal difference).

But for this to work, the transitions would be dp[i] = max over j>i of (S[j] - dp[j]). The base case is dp[n] = S[n] (if it's the player's turn, and they take the entire array, which ends the game, so the difference is S[n]).

But wait, the problem allows the players to choose any k >=2 in their turn. However, in this model, each step j must be a prefix longer than the previous. So for the initial state, the first player can choose any j >=2. Then the next player can choose any j' >j, etc., until j' =n.

So the initial state is 0, and the first player can choose any j >=2. So the maximum difference is the maximum over j >=2 of (S[j] - dp[j]).

But how do we compute this efficiently?

Let's formalize this:

Let dp[i] be the maximum difference the current player can achieve when the last merged prefix ends at position i. Wait, no. Maybe the DP should be defined as follows:

dp[i] is the maximum difference the current player can achieve considering the subarray starting from the i-th position. Wait, but the game is always dealing with prefixes of the original array. So the DP can be defined based on the current position up to which the array has been merged.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to define dp[i] as the maximum difference the current player can achieve if the next merge must start from position i. But in the game, the array is being merged from the left. So the next merge will always take some k elements starting from the current first element, which is the sum of a prefix up to i. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternative idea: the DP state is the current position up to which the merged prefixes have been taken. For example, after merging up to position i, the next merge must start from position i+1. But since the game involves merging prefixes, after merging up to position i, the next merge can be any j >=i+1 +1 (since the next merge's prefix must be longer than i). Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, the sequence of merges is p_1, p_2, ..., p_t where each p_i is a prefix of the original array, and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_t =n. The difference is sum_{k=1 to t} S[p_k] * (-1)^(k+1).

The problem is to choose the sequence of p's such that this sum is maximized.

Now, the first player chooses p_1 >=2. Then the second player chooses p_2 >p_1. Then the first chooses p_3>p_2, etc., until p_t =n.

We need to find the maximum possible sum of S[p_1] - S[p_2] + S[p_3] - ... etc.

To model this, we can use dynamic programming, where for each position i, we compute the maximum value of the difference when the last merge is at position i.

Let's define dp[i] as the maximum difference achievable from position i onwards. That is, if the last merge was at position i, and it's the current player's turn. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think recursively.

Suppose the current player has to choose a merge ending at position j >=i+1 (since the last merge was at i). Then the current player will select j and gain S[j] (since it's their turn), and then the next player will have to choose a merge ending at k >j, and the difference will be S[j] minus the next player's optimal difference (which is dp[j]).

So, the recurrence is:

dp[i] = max_{j >i} (S[j] - dp[j])

The base case is when i =n-1, which is not possible since the game ends when there's one sticker. Or when j can't be chosen. Wait, when the current position is i, and the remaining array has length m =n -i. So to make a merge, we need to choose k >=2. But since the merge is a prefix, j must be >=i+2, so j can range from i+2 to n.

Wait, but in terms of the original array, when the last merge was at position i, the next merge can be any j >=i+1 +1? Because merging a prefix of the current array requires taking at least 2 elements. But the current array after merging up to i is [sum_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ..., a_n}. So the next merge can take k elements from this array. For example, if the current array is size m, then k can be from 2 to m.

But in terms of the original array, merging k elements from the current array would correspond to taking sum_i and the next (k-1) elements. So the sum is sum_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i + (k-1)} = S[i +k-1], since sum_i is S[i], and adding a_{i+1} to a_{i +k-1} is S[i +k-1] - S[i].

So the sum for the next merge is S[i +k-1]. And the j would be i +k-1. But k must be at least 2, so j must be i+1 + ... ?

For example, to merge 2 elements, j =i+1 (sum_i +a_{i+1} = S[i+1]).

So for the current position i, the possible next j's are i+1, i+2, ..., i + (m-1), where m is the current array size. But m =n -i +1. So the current array size after merging up to i is (n -i) +1 =n -i +1. So the maximum j possible is i + (n -i +1 -1) =n.

So j can range from i+1 (merge 2 elements: sum_i and a_{i+1}, sum S[i+1]) up to i + (m-1) =i + (n -i +1 -1) =n.

But for j to be at least i+1 (since k >=2, so j =i+1 when merging 2 elements).

Thus, the recurrence is:

dp[i] = max_{j from i+1 to n} (S[j] - dp[j])

But this would be O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=2e5.

So we need to find a way to compute this recurrence efficiently.

Let's think of the possible transitions. For each i, dp[i] is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=i+1.

So, if we can compute this maximum for all i in O(1) or O(n) time, we can compute the DP in O(n) time.

But how to precompute these maximum values.

Let's think of it from the end. Let's compute dp[i] starting from i =n downto 0.

For i =n: the array has only one element (since j cannot be larger than n). So no more moves can be made. So dp[n] =0?

Wait, no. If the current player is at position i=n, there's no more elements to merge (the array is size 1). So the game ends, and the difference is zero. So dp[n] =0.

For i =n-1: can we merge j =i+1 =n? Which would require merging 2 elements (sum_i and a_{n}). But sum_i is S[i], and sum_{i+1} is S[n]. So merging 2 elements gives sum S[n], which is j=n. Then dp[i] = S[j] - dp[j] = S[n] -0 =S[n].

But for i =n-1, the next j can be n. So dp[n-1] = S[n] - dp[n] = S[n] -0 =S[n].

For i =n-2: j can be i+1 =n-1, or n.

dp[i] = max( S[n-1] - dp[n-1], S[n] - dp[n] )

But S[n] - dp[n] =S[n] -0 =S[n].

So for each i, the maximum is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=i+1.

So if we can precompute the maximum from j =i+1 to n of (S[j] - dp[j]) for each i, then dp[i] is this maximum.

To compute this efficiently, we can use a suffix maximum array.

Let's define a suffix array max_suffix[i] which represents the maximum value of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=i.

Then, dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

So the recurrence becomes:

dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

and max_suffix[i] = max( S[i] - dp[i], max_suffix[i+1] )

We can compute dp and max_suffix from the end (i =n downto 0) as follows:

Initialize dp[n] =0, since no moves can be made.

max_suffix[n] = S[n] - dp[n] = S[n] -0 = S[n]

But wait, for i =n, j can't be larger than n, so there's no move possible. So dp[n] should be 0.

Then, for i =n-1 downto 0:

dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

max_suffix[i] = max( S[i] - dp[i], max_suffix[i+1] )

But wait, why is max_suffix[i] computed this way?

Because for i, the possible j's are >=i+1. So the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=i+1 is max_suffix[i+1]. So dp[i] is this maximum.

Then, when building max_suffix[i], it's the maximum between (S[i] - dp[i]) and max_suffix[i+1]. But why?

Because max_suffix[i] represents the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=i.

So for j >=i, it's the maximum between (S[i] - dp[i]) and the maximum of j >=i+1, which is max_suffix[i+1]. So:

max_suffix[i] = max(S[i] - dp[i], max_suffix[i+1])

But when we compute this, the max_suffix array can be built from right to left.

So for i from n-1 downto 0:

dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

then compute max_suffix[i] as the max between S[i] - dp[i] and max_suffix[i+1]

But wait, what's the initial value of max_suffix?

At i =n, the max_suffix[n] is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=n. Which is only j =n. So S[n] - dp[n] = S[n] -0 =S[n].

Then, for i =n-1:

dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1] = max_suffix[n] = S[n]

max_suffix[i] = max( S[i] - dp[i], max_suffix[i+1] )

So S[i] is S[n-1], dp[i] is S[n], so S[i] - dp[i] = S[n-1] - S[n]. Then compare this with max_suffix[i+1] (which is S[n]). So max_suffix[i] is max( S[n-1] - S[n], S[n] )

Which is S[n] if S[n] is larger.

But what does this represent? For each position i, max_suffix[i] is the maximum value of S[j] - dp[j] for j >=i.

So this approach allows us to compute dp[i] in O(n) time.

Let's test this with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3

2 4 8

Prefix sums S[0]=0, S[1]=2, S[2]=6, S[3]=14.

Compute dp and max_suffix from i=3 downto 0.

Initialize dp[3] =0.

max_suffix[3] = S[3] - dp[3] =14-0=14.

i=2:

dp[2] = max_suffix[3] =14.

max_suffix[2] = max( S[2]-dp[2], max_suffix[3] ) = max(6-14,14) = max(-8,14)=14.

i=1:

dp[1] = max_suffix[2] =14.

max_suffix[1] = max( S[1]-dp[1], max_suffix[2] ) = max(2-14,14) = max(-12,14) =14.

i=0:

dp[0] = max_suffix[1] =14.

max_suffix[0] = max( S[0] - dp[0], max_suffix[1] ) = max(0-14,14) =14.

The result is dp[0] =14, which matches the sample.

Another sample:

Sample Input 2:

4

1 -7 -2 3

S[0] =0.

S[1]=1.

S[2] =1-7= -6.

S[3] =-6-2= -8.

S[4] =-8+3 =-5.

Compute dp and max_suffix from i=4 downto 0.

i=4: dp[4] =0. max_suffix[4] = S[4] -0 =-5.

i=3:

dp[3] =max_suffix[4] =-5.

max_suffix[3] = max( S[3]-dp[3], max_suffix[4] ) = max( -8 - (-5) =-3, -5 ) → max(-3, -5) =-3.

i=2:

dp[2] =max_suffix[3] =-3.

max_suffix[2] = max( S[2] - dp[2], max_suffix[3] ) → S[2]=-6 - (-3) →-6 - (-3) =-3 → max(-3, -3) =-3.

i=1:

dp[1] =max_suffix[2] =-3.

max_suffix[1] = max( S[1] - dp[1], max_suffix[2] ) → 1 - (-3) =4 → max(4, -3)=4.

i=0:

dp[0] =max_suffix[1] =4.

max_suffix[0] = max(0-4,4) →max(-4,4) =4.

The result is dp[0] =4, but the sample output is -3. What's wrong here?

Wait, the sample output is -3. But according to this calculation, dp[0] is 4. Clearly, something's wrong.

Hmm. Let's see. The second sample's explanation says that Petya's score is -8 and Gena's is -5. So difference is -3. But according to this approach, the result is 4, which is incorrect.

So where is the error?

The error must be in the model. Perhaps the model is incorrect.

Let's re-express the problem.

The DP approach above assumes that the first merge can be any j >=1 (since i starts at 0, and j >=i+1=1). But the first move must choose k >=2 elements. So the first merge must be j >=2, since j is the prefix sum up to j. So the first player can choose j >=2.

But in the model above, dp[0] is the maximum difference when starting from position 0. But position 0 represents the state where no elements have been merged. The first player can choose any j >=1, but j must be >=2.

Ah, here's the mistake. The initial state is that the last merged position is 0 (nothing merged yet). So the next merge can choose j >=1+1=2. Because the first merge must take at least two elements. So j must be >=2.

But in the DP model above, when i=0, the next j can be >=i+1=1. So the model allows j=1, which corresponds to merging the first 1 elements (which is invalid).

So the problem is that the model allows j to be i+1, but when i=0, j=1 is allowed, which is invalid. Because the first merge must take at least two elements, so j must be >=2.

So the DP approach is incorrect.

We need to adjust the model to account for the initial merge requiring j >=2.

So the correct approach is:

The first player can choose any j >=2.

Then, the recurrence for dp[i] should start from j >=i+1, but in the initial case (i=0), j must be >=2.

So the DP model needs to be adjusted.

How to handle this?

The recurrence for the general case is that j must be >=i+1 and the merge is possible (i.e., j-i >=1, but since j is the prefix sum's end, that's already handled). However, the first move requires j >=2.

So the initial calculation of the answer is not dp[0], but the maximum over j >=2 of (S[j] - dp[j]).

Because the first player must choose j >=2.

But in the previous model, dp[0] is the maximum over j >=1 of (S[j] - dp[j]). So for the first sample, this works because j=3 is included. But in the second sample, the correct j is 3 (merge first three elements, sum is -8). Then the next player can merge j=4 (sum is -5). Difference would be (-8) - (-5) = -3.

So let's recompute the DP for the second sample.

Sample Input 2:

n=4.

a = [1, -7, -2, 3]

prefix sums S:

S[0] =0.

S[1]=1.

S[2]=1-7 =-6.

S[3]=-6-2=-8.

S[4]=-8+3=-5.

Compute dp and max_suffix as follows:

Initialize dp[4] =0.

max_suffix[4] = S[4] - dp[4] =-5.

i=3:

dp[3] =max_suffix[4] =-5.

max_suffix[3] = max( S[3] - dp[3], max_suffix[4] ) → S[3] is -8 - (-5) =-3. max(-3, -5) =-3.

i=2:

dp[2] =max_suffix[3] =-3.

max_suffix[2] = max( S[2] - dp[2], max_suffix[3] ) → S[2] is -6 - (-3) =-3. max(-3, -3) =-3.

i=1:

dp[1] =max_suffix[2] =-3.

max_suffix[1] = max( S[1] - dp[1], max_suffix[2] ) → S[1] is 1 - (-3) =4. max(4, -3)=4.

i=0:

dp[0] =max_suffix[1] =4.

max_suffix[0] =max( S[0] - dp[0], max_suffix[1] ) → 0 -4 =-4 → max(-4,4)=4.

But the correct answer is the maximum between j >=2. So the answer is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=2.

So for j=2: S[2] - dp[2] =-6 - (-3) =-3.

j=3: S[3] - dp[3] =-8 - (-5) =-3.

j=4: S[4] - dp[4] =-5-0=-5.

So the maximum is -3 (either j=2 or j=3).

So the answer would be -3.

But according to the DP model, the answer is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=2. But in the current model, the initial i=0 allows j >=1, which includes j=1, which is invalid.

So the correct answer is not dp[0], but the maximum of the values (S[j] - dp[j]) for j >=2.

So the solution should compute the answer as the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j in 2..n.

So in the second sample, this maximum is -3 (for j=3), which would give the answer -3.

Thus, the correct approach is:

- Compute the DP and max_suffix arrays as before.

- The answer is the maximum value of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=2.

So the model's initial approach was incorrect because it assumed that the first move could start from j=1, which is not allowed.

Thus, to fix the model, after computing the DP and max_suffix arrays, the answer is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=2.

Let's adjust the code accordingly.

In the first sample, j=3 is allowed. The maximum would be S[3] - dp[3} =14-0=14. Which is correct.

In the second sample, the maximum among j >=2 is j=3: S[3} - dp[3} =-8 - (-5) =-3. Which matches the sample output.

So the correct answer is this maximum.

Thus, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Compute the prefix sums S.

2. Compute the dp and max_suffix arrays from right to left.

3. The answer is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=2.

So the code should compute this maximum.

Now, let's see how to compute this efficiently.

After building the dp and max_suffix arrays, we can iterate j from 2 to n and compute the maximum of S[j] - dp[j].

But given that the max_suffix array is already tracking the maximum from j to n, we can compute this maximum as max_suffix[2].

Because max_suffix[2] is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=2.

Yes! Because max_suffix[i] is the maximum of (S[j] - dp[j}) for j >=i.

So the answer is max_suffix[2].

Because we need the maximum for j >=2.

So the answer is max_suffix[2].

Let's check this with the two samples.

Sample 1:

max_suffix[2] is 14 (from earlier computation). Which is correct.

Sample 2:

max_suffix[2] is -3 (from earlier computation). Which matches the sample output.

Yes! So the answer is simply max_suffix[2}.

Thus, the correct approach is to compute the max_suffix array as before, and the answer is max_suffix[2}.

So the steps are:

- Compute prefix sums.

- Compute dp and max_suffix from right to left.

- The answer is max_suffix[2}.

Now, let's implement this.

The code structure would be:

Read n.

Read the array a.

Compute the prefix sums S.

Initialize dp array (can be a list) and max_suffix array.

But for n up to 2e5, using arrays of size n+2 is feasible.

But in Python, since we're dealing with large n, we can compute this with O(n) time and space.

The code steps:

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

S = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    S[i] = S[i-1] + a[i-1]

dp = [0]*(n+2)  # maybe up to n+1 is sufficient.

max_suffix = [0]*(n+2)

dp[n] =0

max_suffix[n] = S[n] - dp[n]

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

    current = S[i] - dp[i]

    max_suffix[i] = max(current, max_suffix[i+1])

print(max_suffix[2])

Wait, but what if n is 2? Then the maximum j is 2. So max_suffix[2} is S[2} - dp[2}.

Let's test with n=2.

Sample input:

2

5 5

S = [0,5, 10]

Compute dp and max_suffix:

i=2:

dp[2] =0.

max_suffix[2}=10-0=10.

i=1:

dp[1} =max_suffix[2}=10.

max_suffix[1} =max(5-10= -5, 10) →10.

i=0:

dp[0} =max_suffix[1}=10.

max_suffix[0} =max(0-10= -10, 10) →10.

The answer is max_suffix[2}=10.

Which is correct. The first player takes both elements (sum 10), difference is 10-0=10.

So this works.

Another test case: sample 2.

max_suffix[2} is-3.

Yes.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, let's write the code.

Read n.

Read a as list.

Compute S.

Initialize dp and max_suffix arrays.

Compute from i=n downto 0.

Then, output max_suffix[2}.

This should work.

Now, implement this in Python.

But for n up to 2e5, the code must be efficient.

In Python, the code would be:

Read n.

Read a.

Compute prefix sums S.

Initialize dp and max_suffix as lists of size n+2.

But since in Python lists are dynamic, we can build them as follows:

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

prefix = [0] * (n +1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]

dp = [0] * (n+2)  # index from 0 to n

max_suffix = [0] * (n+2)

dp[n] =0

max_suffix[n] = prefix[n] - dp[n]

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    dp[i] = max_suffix[i+1]

    current = prefix[i] - dp[i]

    max_suffix[i] = max(current, max_suffix[i+1])

print(max_suffix[2])

Wait, but what if n is 2?

Then i ranges down to 0.

But when i=1:

dp[1] =max_suffix[2} = prefix[2} - dp[2} (since max_suffix[2} is prefix[2} -0 =10 in previous example.

But this code should work.

Testing sample 2:

prefix is [0,1, -6, -8, -5]

max_suffix[4} = prefix[4} -0 =-5.

i=3: dp[3} = max_suffix[4} =-5. current = prefix[3} - dp[3} =-8 - (-5) =-3. max_suffix[3} =max(-3, -5) =-3.

i=2: dp[2} = max_suffix[3} =-3. current =prefix[2} - (-3) =-6 +3 =-3. max_suffix[2} =max(-3, -3) =-3.

i=1: dp[1} = max_suffix[2} =-3. current =1 - (-3)=4. max_suffix[1} =max(4, -3) =4.

i=0: dp[0} =max_suffix[1} =4. current =0-4 =-4. max_suffix[0} =max(-4,4) =4.

So max_suffix[2} is-3. Which is correct.

Thus, the code works.

Another test case:

Sample 1:

prefix[3}=14.

max_suffix[3}=14-0=14.

i=2: dp[2}=14. current=6-14= -8. max_suffix[2} =max(-8,14) =14.

i=1: dp[1}=14. current=2-14= -12. max_suffix[1} =max(-12,14)=14.

i=0: dp[0}=14. current=0-14=-14. max_suffix[0} =max(-14,14)=14.

max_suffix[2} is14.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code works.

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
