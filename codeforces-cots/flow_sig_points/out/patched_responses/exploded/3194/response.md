Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the next lucky year after the current year n. A lucky year is one that has at most one non-zero digit. So, for example, numbers like 5, 100, 40000 are lucky. But 12, 3001, 12345 are not. So, the task is to find the smallest year y > n such that y is a lucky year, then output y - n.

Hmm, how to approach this? Let's think about the structure of lucky years. A lucky year is of the form d * 10^k, where d is a digit from 1 to 9, and k is the number of zeros following it. For example, 5 is 5*10^0, 100 is 1*10^2, etc. So all lucky years are numbers with exactly one non-zero digit, except when they have trailing zeros. Wait, but the problem statement says "no more than 1 non-zero digit", which allows numbers with exactly zero non-zero digits? No, wait, but zero can't be a year here. So all lucky years have exactly one non-zero digit followed by any number of zeros (including zero zeros). So the possible candidates are all numbers of the form d followed by m zeros, where d is from 1-9 and m is >=0.

So the plan is: generate all possible lucky years greater than n and find the smallest one. Then subtract n from that year to get the answer.

The question is, how to efficiently generate the next possible candidates.

Let's think about the possible candidates. For example, if the current year is 4, the next is 5. For 201, the next is 300. For 4000, it's 5000. Wait, but 4000 is already a lucky year? Because 4000 has one non-zero digit (4) followed by three zeros. So in the third example, the input is 4000. The next lucky year would be 5000. So the answer is 5000 -4000=1000.

So, the steps to find the next lucky year after n are:

1. Find the smallest number larger than n that is of the form d*10^k, where d is a digit 1-9 and k >=0.

How can we generate all possible candidates and find the minimal one?

Let's think about possible candidates. For a given n, the next possible lucky year could be:

- The next number with the same number of digits as n. For example, if n is 201 (3 digits), the next possible in the same digit count is 300. Then, also numbers like 400, ..., 900. But 300 is the first one larger than 201.

- The next possible candidate could have one more digit. For example, if n is 999, the next would be 1000. So for numbers where all digits are 9, the next is 1000, which is a lucky year.

So the approach is to generate all possible candidates that could be larger than n and then find the minimum among them.

But how to generate these candidates?

Let's consider the possible candidates as follows:

For each possible length (number of digits) starting from the length of n up to length+1 (since adding a digit could be needed), generate all possible lucky numbers of that length and check which ones are larger than n.

But generating all possible candidates for all possible lengths might be manageable because the numbers of such candidates per length is limited.

For example, a length of m digits can have m possible positions for the non-zero digit. Wait, no. For a lucky year, the non-zero digit must be the first digit followed by all zeros. So a lucky number with m digits is a number where the first digit is d (1-9), followed by m-1 zeros.

Wait, wait. Oh right, a lucky year is a number that has exactly one non-zero digit, which is the first digit, followed by all zeros. So for example, 5000 is 5 followed by three zeros. So all lucky years are of the form d * 10^k, where d is from 1-9 and k >=0. So for a 4-digit number, the possible lucky years are 1000, 2000, ..., 9000. For a 3-digit number: 100, 200, ..., 900. For a 1-digit: 1-9. So, for each possible length, the candidates are 9 possibilities (d from 1-9) multiplied by 10^(k), where k is the number of zeros, which is (length-1).

Wait, for example, for a 3-digit number, length is 3. So the first digit is d (1-9), followed by two zeros. So d * 10^2.

So the candidates can be generated by considering all possible lengths (from the length of n up to length +1) and for each length, generate the possible d values (from 1 to 9) multiplied by 10^(length-1). Then, collect all these candidates that are larger than n, and find the smallest among them.

But how do we do this efficiently?

Let's take the example of n=201.

The length of n is 3. So possible candidates in the same length are 300, 400, ..., 900. Then, the next possible length is 4 digits: 1000, 2000, etc. So the candidates for 3 digits would be 300, 400, etc. The minimal candidate larger than 201 is 300. Then compare with 1000 (which is 1000>201, but 300 is smaller). So the answer is 300.

So the algorithm is:

1. Find all possible candidate lucky years that are larger than n.

   a. Generate candidates with the same number of digits as n.

   b. Generate candidates with one more digit than n.

   Because, for example, n=999. The same digits (3) would generate candidates like 1000? Wait no. Wait, the same digits as 999 is 3. So candidates with 3 digits are 1000? Wait no. Wait, 3-digit candidates would be 100, 200, ..., 900. But 999's next possible is 1000 (which is 4 digits). So in that case, the candidate is 1000.

So the steps would be:

For the current n:

- Generate all candidates for the current number of digits (m) where the candidate is d * 10^{m-1}, d ranges from 1 to 9.

   For example, n=201 (3 digits), m=3. Candidates are 100, 200, ..., 900. Wait, but 100 is 3 digits. Wait, 100 is 3 digits (1 followed by two zeros). Wait, 201 is 3 digits, so the candidates for 3 digits are 100, 200, ..., 900. Wait, but 100 is 100, which is less than 201. So we need to find the candidates in the same digit count that are larger than n.

Wait, but for n=201, the next candidate in the same digits is the minimal d*100 where d*100 >201. So d can be 3,4,...9. So 300 is the first. Then, the minimal candidate in the same digit count is 300.

But also, we need to check if there's a candidate in the next digit count (4 digits). For example, if n is 999, the candidates in same digit count (3 digits) would be 100, 200, ..., 900 (all less than 999), so none are valid. Then, the next candidates are 1000, 2000, etc. The smallest is 1000.

So the approach is:

- Generate all possible candidates that are:

   a. Of the same number of digits as n, but larger than n.

   b. Of the next possible number of digits (length +1), which would be the smallest possible for that length (i.e., 10^m, where m is the number of digits of n, but 10^m is 1 followed by m zeros. So for m digits, 10^(m) is 1 followed by m zeros, which is m+1 digits. So the next possible length is m+1 digits, with the minimal candidate being 10^m, which is 1 followed by m zeros. Then, other candidates would be 2*10^m, ...,9*10^m. So the minimal candidate in the next length is 10^m.

So, for example, for n=201 (3 digits), the next length is 4 digits. The candidates in 4 digits are 1000, 2000, ...,9000. The minimal is 1000, which is larger than 300 (the candidate in same digits).

So in this case, the answer is 300.

So the algorithm is:

1. Generate all possible candidates in the same digit count as n, which are larger than n. Among these, find the minimal.

2. Generate the minimal candidate in the next digit count (which is 10^m, where m is the number of digits of n). Compare this with the minimal candidate from step 1.

3. The answer is the minimal between these two.

But wait, maybe there are other candidates in the next digit count that are smaller than 10^m. No, because the next digit count's minimal candidate is 10^m (like 1000 for 3 digits). So any other candidate in the next digit count (like 2000, 3000, etc) is larger than 10^m. So the minimal candidate for next digit count is 10^m.

So the steps are:

- Compute all possible candidates in same digits (d*10^{m-1} where d is from 1 to 9 and d*10^{m-1} >n).

   For each d in 1..9, compute candidate =d * 10^{m-1}. Collect those candidates >n. The minimal among them is the best in same digits.

- Compute the candidate for next digits: 10^m.

- Compare the minimal same-digit candidate and the next-digit candidate. The answer is the minimum of the two.

So, for example, if n=4000 (4 digits):

Same-digit candidates are d*1000 where d*1000>4000. So d can be 5,6,7,8,9. The minimal is 5000.

Next-digit candidate is 10^4 =10000. So between 5000 and 10000, 5000 is smaller. So the answer is 5000 -4000=1000.

Another example: n=4 (1 digit). Same-digit candidates are d*1 where d>4. The minimal is 5. Next-digit candidate is 10. So 5 is better. Answer is 1.

Another example: n=999. Same-digit candidates (3 digits) are d*100 where d*100>999. But 999 is 999, and 100*10=1000 (but wait, no. Wait, 3-digit candidates are d*100 (since m-1 is 3-1=2 zeros). For example, d=1 gives 100, which is less than 999. d=10? No, d can't be 10. So d ranges from 1 to 9. So for 3 digits, all same-digit candidates are 100, 200, ...,900. All are <=999. So no candidates in same digits. So the minimal same-digit candidate is None. Then the next-digit candidate is 10^3=1000. So the answer is 1000-999=1.

So the algorithm steps are:

Compute m = number of digits of n.

Generate same_digit_candidates: for d in 1..9, compute d * 10^(m-1). Collect those >n. The minimal among them.

Generate next_digit_candidate: 10^m.

If same_digit_candidates exist, the minimal candidate is min(min_same, next_digit_candidate). Else, it's next_digit_candidate.

So how to compute the number of digits of n?

Well, in Python, converting to a string and checking len(str(n)), but that's O(1) for small n. Alternatively, we can compute m as the length of the string representation of n.

But for n up to 1e9, converting to string is manageable.

Once we have m, same_digits is the same digit count as n. For each d from 1 to 9:

candidate = d * (10 ** (m-1)).

If candidate >n, add to the list of possible candidates.

Then, find the minimal in that list (if any).

Then compute next_digit_candidate = 10**m.

Compare the minimal same_digit candidate (if exists) with next_digit_candidate.

The answer is the minimal between these two, minus n.

So code steps:

Read n.

Compute m = len(str(n)).

same_digit_candidates = [d * 10^(m-1) for d in 1..9 if d*10^(m-1) >n]

if same_digit_candidates is not empty:

   min_same = min(same_digit_candidates)

else:

   min_same = infinity

next_digit = 10**m

result = min( min_same, next_digit ) -n

return result

Yes, that's the approach.

Let's test this against the examples.

Example 1:

Input:4

m =1 digits.

same_digit_candidates: d*10^0 =d*1. We need d>4. So d ranges 5-9. Candidates 5,6,7,8,9. min_same is5.

next_digit is10^1=10.

min(5,10) is5. 5-4=1. Correct.

Example2:

Input:201.

m=3.

same_digit_candidates: d*100 where d*100>201.

d can be 3-9. So 300, 400, ...,900. min_same is300.

next_digit is10^3=1000.

min(300,1000) is300. 300-201=99. Correct.

Example3:

Input:4000. m=4.

same_digit_candidates: d*1000>4000. d=5-9. candidates are5000,6000, etc. min is5000.

next_digit is10^4=10000.

min(5000,10000) is5000. 5000-4000=1000. Correct.

Another example: n=999.

m=3.

same_digit_candidates: d*100>999. For d=1:100>999? No. d=2:200>999? No. ... up to d=9: 900>999? No. So same_digit_candidates is empty. So min_same is infinity. Then next_digit is1000. So answer is 1000-999=1.

Another example: n=5000. Then same_digit_candidates would be d*1000>5000. d=6,7,8,9. The minimal is6000. next_digit is10000. So the next lucky year is6000. 6000-5000=1000. But if n is 5000, the answer would be 1000. So the code works.

Another case: n=100. The same-digit candidates are d*100>100. So d from 2-9. The minimal is200. next_digit is1000. So answer is200-100=100. But what's the next lucky year after 100? It's 200. So yes.

So this logic seems correct.

Now, code:

First, read n as an integer. Then compute m as the number of digits of n. Then generate same_digit_candidates. Then compute min_same and next_digit.

But how to compute m? For example, len(str(n)).

But what about leading zeros? Well, n is given as a positive integer, so no leading zeros.

So code:
