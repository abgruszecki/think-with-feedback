Okay, let's see. The problem is about counting the number of ways to replace question marks in two string templates such that the resulting strings are non-comparable. Non-comparable here means that there exists at least one position where s[i] > w[i] and another position where s[j] < w[j]. 

Hmm. So the key is to calculate all possible pairs of s and w that satisfy this condition. But since the input can be up to 1e5 characters, we need an efficient approach. 

First, the total possible pairs is (number of ways for s) multiplied by (number of ways for w). Then, we need to subtract the cases where s and w are comparable. What are the comparable cases? They are when for all i, s[i] >= w[i], or for all i, s[i] <= w[i]. But wait, those two scenarios might overlap when all s[i] = w[i], which is counted in both. So the inclusion-exclusion principle would apply here. The number of comparable pairs would be (A + B - C), where A is the number of pairs where s >= w in all positions, B is the number where s <= w in all positions, and C is the number where s equals w in all positions. Then the non-comparable pairs would be total_pairs - (A + B - C).

So the formula is: result = (total_s * total_w) - A - B + C. Because subtracting A and B, but adding back C since it's subtracted twice.

Now, the challenge is to compute A, B, C efficiently. Let's think about how to compute each of these.

Let's first compute the total number of possibilities for s and w. For each character in the template s, if it's a '?', it can be replaced by any digit (0-9). So for s, the total possibilities is the product of 10 for each '?', similarly for w. Let's compute this as total_s and total_w.

Then, A is the number of pairs where s[i] >= w[i] for all positions i. How to compute A? For each position i, the pair (s_i, w_i) must satisfy s_i >= w_i. But each of s and w may have fixed digits or question marks.

Similarly, B is the number of pairs where s[i] <= w[i] for all positions i.

C is the number of pairs where s[i] == w[i] for all positions i.

So for each position i, we need to compute the number of possible (s_i, w_i) pairs that satisfy the condition. Then multiply across all positions to get A, B, or C.

For example, for A: for each i, the number of (s_i, w_i) pairs where s_i >= w_i. Multiply all these counts for each i to get A. Similarly for B, and for C.

But how to compute the count for each position i, given the possible s and w characters.

Let's break it down:

For each position i, the s_char is either a digit or '?', and same for w_char. Let's denote the possibilities for s_i and w_i as possible_s and possible_w. For each possible pair (a, b) in possible_s × possible_w, we check if a >= b. The number of such pairs contributes to the multiplicative product for A.

So for each position i, compute the count of valid (a, b) pairs for the current condition (for A, B, C). Then multiply all these counts across all positions.

So, for each position i, we need to compute:

- For A: the number of pairs (a, b) where a is in s_i's possible digits, b is in w_i's possible digits, and a >= b.
- For B: similar, but a <= b.
- For C: a == b.

Wait, but how do we compute the possible digits for s_i and w_i?

For example, if s_i is '5', then possible_s is {5}. If it's '?', possible_s is 0-9. Similarly for w_i.

So for each position i, possible_s is a set of digits allowed, and possible_w is a set of digits allowed. Then, the count for A_i (contribution to A) is the number of pairs (a, b) where a is in possible_s, b is in possible_w, and a >= b.

But calculating this for each position i can be done efficiently. Let's precompute for each position the possible_s and possible_w.

Now, considering that n can be up to 1e5, and for each position, we need to calculate A_i, B_i, C_i, then multiply them across all positions. So each of these steps must be O(1) per position.

So the approach is:

1. Precompute for each position i, the possible_s and possible_w digits.
   For each i, if the character is a digit, possible_s[i] is a list with that digit. If it's '?', possible_s[i] is all digits 0-9. Same for possible_w.

2. For each position i, compute the number of pairs for A_i (a >= b), B_i (a <= b), C_i (a == b).

3. The total A is the product of all A_i's modulo 1e9+7. Similarly for B and C.

4. Compute the total pairs (total_s * total_w) mod MOD.

5. The answer is (total_pairs - A - B + C) mod MOD. But since subtraction can lead to negative numbers, we need to add MOD and take mod again to ensure it's positive.

So the main steps are:

- Precompute possible_s and possible_w for each position.
- Compute the product of A_i, B_i, C_i for each i.
- Calculate the formula.

Now, the key part is efficiently calculating A_i, B_i, C_i for each position.

Let's think about how to compute, for a given pair of possible_s and possible_w, the counts.

Possible_s is a list of digits (maybe 1 element, maybe 10). Same for possible_w.

For A_i (a >= b), the count is sum_{a in s} sum_{b in w} (1 if a >= b else 0).

Similarly for B_i (a <= b), and C_i (a == b).

But for each possible a and b, we need to check these conditions.

But the maximum possible s is 10 digits, same for w. So for each position, the possible combinations are up to 10 * 10 = 100 possibilities. For each, we can precompute the counts for A_i, B_i, C_i.

But for n=1e5, even 1e5 * 100 operations is 1e7, which is manageable.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about possible_s and possible_w as sets of digits, and compute the required counts using mathematical calculations instead of iterating all possible pairs.

For example, for possible_s S and possible_w W:

A_i = sum_{a in S} sum_{b in W} [a >= b]

Which can be rewritten as sum_{a in S} (number of elements in W that are <= a).

So for each a in S, the count is the number of elements in W that are <= a. Summing over all a in S gives the total for A_i.

Similarly, B_i is sum_{a in S} sum_{b in W} [a <= b] = sum_{b in W} sum_{a in S} [a <= b] = sum_{b in W} (number of a in S <= b). Which is the same as sum_{b in W} (count of a <= b in S).

For C_i, it's sum_{a in S} sum_{b in W} [a == b] = sum_{d=0 to 9} (count of d in S) * (count of d in W).

So for each position, we can compute these values efficiently.

Let's see. Let's represent S and W as multisets (counts for each digit). For example, for possible_s, we can have a frequency array s_counts where s_counts[d] is 1 if d is in possible_s, 0 otherwise. Similarly for w_counts.

But in practice, possible_s is either a single digit (when the character is fixed) or all 10 digits (when it's '?').

So for each position, possible_s and possible_w can be represented as their possible digits. Let's see:

Case 1: s_char is a digit (d1). Then S is {d1}.

Case 2: s_char is '?'. Then S is 0-9.

Same for w_char.

So for each position, possible_s is either a single digit or all digits. Similarly for possible_w.

So for each position, we can precompute the possible digits for S and W.

Then, for A_i:

If S is a single digit (a), then the count is the number of digits in W that are <= a.

If S is all digits (0-9), then for each a in 0-9, count the number of digits in W that are <= a, and sum them all. Which is equivalent to sum_{b in W} (number of a >= b in 0-9). Wait, that's the same as sum_{b in W} (10 - b) if a is 0-9. Because for a particular b, the number of a in S (0-9) that are >= b is 10 - b. Because a can be from 0 to 9. So for example, if b is 3, then a >=3 can be 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → 7 digits. 10-3=7. So yes, sum over all b in W of (10 - b) when S is all digits.

But wait, if W is a single digit (b), then for S being all digits, the count is (10 - b). If W is all digits (0-9), then the sum is sum_{b=0 to9} (10 - b) → sum from 0 to9 of (10 - b) = sum from 1 to10 of x → 55. So when S is all digits and W is all digits, A_i is 55.

Similarly, for B_i when S is all digits and W is all digits, B_i is sum_{b in 0-9} (b +1) (since for each b, the number of a <= b in 0-9 is b+1). So sum from 0 to9 (b+1) is 55 as well.

Hmm. So perhaps for each position, depending on the possible_s and possible_w types (fixed or all digits), we can compute A_i, B_i, C_i in O(1) time.

Let's formalize this.

For a given position, possible_s is either a single digit (s) or all digits (represented as '?').

Possible_w is either a single digit (w) or all digits.

So there are 4 possible cases for each position:

1. s is fixed, w is fixed.

2. s is fixed, w is '?'.

3. s is '?', w is fixed.

4. s is '?', w is '?'.

For each of these cases, we can compute A_i, B_i, C_i.

Let's create a table for each case.

Case 1: s is fixed (s_digit), w is fixed (w_digit).

A_i = 1 if s_digit >= w_digit, else 0.

B_i = 1 if s_digit <= w_digit, else 0.

C_i = 1 if s_digit == w_digit, else 0.

Case 2: s is fixed (s_digit), w is '?'. Possible_w is 0-9.

Compute A_i: number of w in 0-9 where s_digit >= w. So s_digit can be 0-9. For example, if s_digit is 5, then w can be 0-5 → 6 options. So A_i = s_digit + 1.

B_i: number of w in 0-9 where s_digit <= w. That's (9 - s_digit) + 1 = 10 - s_digit.

C_i: number of w in 0-9 where s_digit == w. That's 1 (only w = s_digit).

Case 3: s is '?', w is fixed (w_digit).

A_i: number of s in 0-9 where s >= w_digit. That's 10 - w_digit.

B_i: number of s in 0-9 where s <= w_digit. That's w_digit + 1.

C_i: 1 (s must be equal to w_digit).

Case 4: both are '?'.

A_i: sum for s in 0-9 and w in 0-9 where s >= w. Let's calculate this. For each possible w, count the number of s >= w. For w=0, s can be 0-9 (10). For w=1, s can be 1-9 (9). ... up to w=9, s can be 9 (1). So the sum is 10 +9+8+...+1 = 55.

B_i: same as A_i, since a <= b is equivalent to b >= a, but when s and w are both all digits, swapping their roles. Wait, sum over s and w where s <= w. For each s, count the number of w >= s. So for s=0, 10 options. s=1: 9, etc. Sum is 55. So B_i is 55.

C_i: sum for s in 0-9 and w in 0-9 where s ==w. There are 10 such pairs (0-0, 1-1, ...,9-9). So C_i is 10.

So for each case, we can compute A_i, B_i, C_i in O(1) time.

So the plan is:

For each position i:

- Determine the type (case) based on s and w characters.

- Compute A_i, B_i, C_i based on the case.

- Multiply all A_i's to get A, all B_i's to get B, all C_i's to get C.

Once we have A, B, C, the formula is (total_s * total_w - A - B + C) mod MOD.

Now, how to compute total_s and total_w?

Each '?' in s contributes a factor of 10. So total_s is 10^count_s_question_marks. Similarly for total_w.

So for each string, count the number of '?', and compute 10^count mod MOD.

But since n can be up to 1e5, and exponents can be up to 1e5, we need to precompute the powers of 10 modulo MOD. So we can precompute an array pow10 where pow10[k] is 10^k mod MOD. This can be done in O(n) time.

Alternatively, for each count, compute pow(10, count, MOD). But in Python, pow can compute this efficiently.

So:

count_s_q = number of '?' in s.

count_w_q = number of '?' in w.

total_s = pow(10, count_s_q, MOD)

total_w = pow(10, count_w_q, MOD)

Then, total_pairs = (total_s * total_w) % MOD.

Now, the steps for the code:

Read n.

Read s and w strings.

Compute count_s_q and count_w_q.

Compute total_s and total_w.

Initialize variables A, B, C as 1 each.

For each i in 0..n-1:

   s_char = s[i]

   w_char = w[i]

   Determine the case (1-4), compute a_i, b_i, c_i.

   Multiply A by a_i mod MOD.

   Multiply B by b_i mod MOD.

   Multiply C by c_i mod MOD.

Then compute the result as (total_pairs - A - B + C) mod MOD. Since the result can be negative, add MOD and then mod again.

So (result = (total_pairs - A - B + C) % MOD).

But since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and all operations are mod MOD, this should handle it.

Now, let's test the examples.

First example:

Input:

2

90

09

s is '9' and '0'. w is '0' and '9'.

For each position:

Position 0:

s_char is '9', w_char is '0' → case 1.

A_i: 9 >=0 → 1.

B_i: 9 <=0 → 0.

C_i: 0.

Multiply A *=1, B *=0 → B becomes 0.

Position 1:

s_char '0', w_char '9' → case 1.

A_i: 0 >=9 → 0.

B_i: 0 <=9 → 1.

Multiply A *=0 → A=0, B *=1 → B=0.

C is 1 * 0 (position 0) * 0 (position 1) → 0.

So total_pairs is (10^0 * 10^0) * (10^0 *10^0) → 1*1=1.

Result is (1 -0 -0 + 0) mod MOD → 1. Which matches the example.

Second example:

Input:

2

11

55

s is '1' and '1', w is '5' and '5'.

Each position:

s is 1, w is5. Case1.

A_i: 1 >=5 → 0. So A is 0*0=0.

B_i: 1 <=5 → 1. So B is 1*1=1.

C is 0 for both positions. So C=0.

total_pairs is 1*1=1.

Result is (1 -0 -1 +0) mod MOD → 0.

Third example:

Both are all '?'. So n=5.

Each position is case4.

For A_i, B_i, each is 55, C_i is10.

A = 55^5 mod MOD.

B=55^5 mod MOD.

C=10^5 mod MOD.

total_s = 10^5 mod MOD.

total_w =10^5 mod MOD.

total_pairs = (10^5 * 10^5) mod MOD = 1e10 mod MOD.

But the sample output is 993531194.

So the formula would be:

total_pairs - A - B + C.

Let's compute:

total_pairs = (10^5 *10^5) mod MOD = 1e10 mod MOD. 1e10 / 1e9+7 → 1e10 = 10*(1e9) → 10 * (1e9+7 -7) + 0 → 10*(1e9+7) -70 → remainder is -70 mod MOD. So 1e10 mod MOD is (1e10 % MOD) → 1e10 = 10000000000, MOD=1e9+7=1000000007.

Compute 10000000000 / 1000000007:

1000000007 * 9 is 9000000063. Subtract from 10000000000 → 999999937. Which is 10000000000 -9*1000000007 = 999999937.

So total_pairs is 999999937.

A and B are 55^5 mod MOD. Let's compute 55^5:

55^2 = 3025 → mod 1e9+7 is 3025.

55^3 = 3025 *55 = 166375 → mod MOD is 166375.

55^4 = 166375 *55 = 9,150,625 → mod MOD is 9150625.

55^5 = 9150625 *55 = 503,284,375 → mod MOD is 503284375.

So A = 503284375, B same.

C is 10^5 mod MOD → 100000.

So formula:

999999937 - 503284375 -503284375 +100000 → 999999937 - 1006568750 +100000 → 

Let's compute:

999999937 - 1006568750 = -6568, 813?

Wait, 1006568750 -999999937 = 656, 8813?

Wait, 1006568750 is 1,006,568,750. Subtract 999,999,937: 1,006,568,750 -999,999,937 = 6,568,813.

So 999,999,937 -1,006,568,750 = -6,568,813. Then add 100,000 → -6,568,813 +100,000 = -6,468,813.

Now, mod 1e9+7. Let's compute:

MOD is 1,000,000,007.

So -6,468,813 mod 1e9+7 is 1,000,000,007 -6,468,813 = 993,531,194.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code should work.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The code steps:

Read n.

Read s and w.

Compute count_s_q and count_w_q.

Compute total_s = pow(10, count_s_q, MOD)

total_w = pow(10, count_w_q, MOD)

total_pairs = (total_s * total_w) % MOD

Initialize A, B, C as 1.

For each character pair in s and w:

   get s_char and w_char.

   determine the case.

   compute a_i, b_i, c_i.

   multiply A, B, C by a_i, b_i, c_i modulo MOD.

Then compute (total_pairs - A - B + C) % MOD.

But since in Python, modulo can be negative, so the final step is (result) % MOD.

So code:

MOD = 10**9 +7

n = int(input())

s = input().strip()

w = input().strip()

count_s_q = s.count('?')

count_w_q = w.count('?')

total_s = pow(10, count_s_q, MOD)

total_w = pow(10, count_w_q, MOD)

total_pairs = (total_s * total_w) % MOD

A = 1

B = 1

C = 1

for sc, wc in zip(s, w):

    # determine possible_s and possible_w

    # compute a_i, b_i, c_i

    # case 1: both fixed
    if sc != '?' and wc != '?':
        s_d = int(sc)
        w_d = int(wc)
        a_i = 1 if s_d >= w_d else 0
        b_i = 1 if s_d <= w_d else 0
        c_i = 1 if s_d == w_d else 0
    elif sc != '?':  # sc is fixed, wc is ?
        s_d = int(sc)
        # w is ?, possible_w is 0-9
        a_i = s_d + 1  # number of w_d <= s_d
        b_i = 10 - s_d  # number of w_d >= s_d
        c_i = 1  # only w_d == s_d
    elif wc != '?':  # sc is ?, wc is fixed
        w_d = int(wc)
        a_i = 10 - w_d  # number of s_d >= w_d
        b_i = w_d + 1   # number of s_d <= w_d
        c_i = 1
    else:  # both are ?
        a_i = 55
        b_i = 55
        c_i = 10

    A = (A * a_i) % MOD
    B = (B * b_i) % MOD
    C = (C * c_i) % MOD

result = (total_pairs - A - B + C) % MOD
print(result % MOD)

Yes, this should work. Let's test the sample inputs.

First sample:

n=2

s = '90', w = '09'

Processing each position:

Pos 0: sc='9', wc='0' → case 1. s_d=9, w_d=0.

a_i=1, b_i=1 (since 9<=0 is false, so b_i=0? Wait, wait.

Wait, in case 1, when sc is fixed and wc is fixed:

b_i is 1 if s_d <= w_d. So here, s_d is 9, w_d is 0. 9 <=0 is false. So b_i is 0.

So pos 0:

a_i=1, b_i=0, c_i=0.

A becomes 1 *1 =1.

B becomes 1 *0=0.

C becomes 1 *0=0.

pos1: sc='0', wc='9'.

case1.

s_d=0, w_d=9.

a_i=0 (0 >=9? No). b_i=1 (0 <=9 yes). c_i=0.

A becomes 1*0=0.

B becomes 0 *1 =0.

C remains 0*0=0.

So A=0, B=0, C=0.

total_pairs is 1*1=1.

result = 1-0-0 +0 =1 mod MOD → 1.

Which matches.

Yes. So the code works for the first sample.

Another example where both are fixed and not comparable.

So the code should be correct.
