<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of flats to turn off their lights so that no one is disturbed. The disturbed condition is when a flat i (where 1 < i < n) has a_i=0 and the adjacent flats (i-1 and i+1) are both 1. So we need to eliminate all such cases by turning off some lights.

Hmm. So the main idea is to find all the disturbed people first. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that after turning off exactly k flats, there are no disturbed people left. So our goal is to find the minimal k such that all possible disturbed conditions are prevented by turning off certain flats.

Wait, but the disturbed condition depends on the current state of the a array. So when we turn off some flats, we might create new disturbed conditions. Or wait, no. Because when you turn off a flat's light, you set a_i to 0. But the existing a array is given, and we need to choose which flats to turn off (i.e., set their a to 0). Wait, no. Wait, the original a array has some 1s and 0s. When you turn off a light in a flat, you're changing a 1 to 0. Because the problem states that the people in exactly k distinct flats will turn off their lights. So if a flat is already 0, you can't turn it off again. So the process is: start with the given a array. Then, choose a subset of flats (which are currently 1) to turn their a to 0. The question is, after doing so, there are no disturbed people. We need the minimal number of such flats to turn off.

Wait, wait. Let me re-read the problem statement. Oh right! The problem says "people from exactly k pairwise distinct flats will turn off the lights". So the original a array has some 0s and 1s. The people in some flats (which are currently 1) turn their lights off, changing them to 0. The others remain as they are.

So the process is: select a subset S of flats that are currently 1 (since you can't turn off a light that's already off) such that after turning those to 0, there are no disturbed people. The minimal size of S.

So the first thing is to find all the current disturbed people in the initial state. If there are none, then the answer is 0. But when we turn off some lights, we might create new disturbed people. For example, suppose there's a pattern 1 1 1. If the middle 1 is turned off (so it's 1 0 1), then the middle flat (now 0) has neighbors both 1, so it becomes a disturbed person. So turning off certain flats can introduce new disturbances. So we need to make sure that after turning off some flats, the resulting array has no disturbed people.

This complicates things. Because the initial array might not have any disturbed people, and the answer is 0. But if after turning off some flats, new disturbed people appear, then our solution must account for that.

So the problem isn't just about handling existing disturbed people but ensuring that in the modified array, there are none. So how do we model this?

The approach here is to model the problem as selecting a subset of 1s to turn into 0s such that in the resulting array, there are no positions i (2<=i<=n-1) where a[i-1] and a[i+1] are 1, and a[i] is 0.

But the problem is that when you turn off a flat, you can affect multiple positions. For example, turning off flat i could affect i-1 (if i-1 is 1) and i+1 (if i+1 is 1) and create new disturbed people.

So the naive approach of checking all possible subsets is not feasible for n up to 100. But n is 100, so even O(2^100) is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.

So what's the structure of the problem? Let's think.

We need to ensure that in the final array, for every i between 2 and n-1, it's not the case that a[i] is 0 and a[i-1] and a[i+1] are 1. So the forbidden patterns are 1 0 1 in any consecutive triplet. So how can we model this?

An initial idea is that for any such triplet, either the middle 0 must be turned into 1 (but that's impossible because turning off a flat only changes 1 to 0) or one of the left or right 1s must be turned off (so that either the left or right becomes 0, breaking the triplet).

Wait, but the middle 0 is in the original array. So if the original a[i] is 0, then even if the original a[i-1] and a[i+1] are 1, then that's a disturbed person. Unless we turn off either a[i-1] or a[i+1].

Wait, no. Wait, the original a array may have 1 0 1. Then the middle flat is a disturbed person. To eliminate this disturbance, we have to turn off either the left (i-1) or the right (i+1) flat. Because turning those from 1 to 0 would make their respective a values 0, which would break the 1 0 1 pattern.

Alternatively, if the original a[i] is 1, but after turning off a[i], it becomes 0. Then if the neighbors are 1, that creates a new disturbance. So we have to prevent that.

So the problem is to find a set of 1s to turn off such that:

- All existing disturbed people (i.e., original 1 0 1 triplets) are fixed by turning off either left or right.

- Any new disturbed people that could be created by turning off a flat (like creating a 1 0 1 triplet) are also prevented.

This seems complicated. So how can we model this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph where each node represents a position that is a 1 in the original array. Turning off a position (i) is equivalent to selecting it. The selection must cover all existing and potential disturbed positions.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as an interval problem. Let's think about the required constraints.

For each existing disturbed position i (original a[i] is 0 and a[i-1] and a[i+1] are 1), we must turn off either i-1 or i+1.

Additionally, for any position j that is turned off (originally a[j] was 1, now 0), we need to ensure that after turning off j, the new a[j] is 0, and if either j-1 or j+1 is 1, then the adjacent positions can't form a 1 0 1 triplet.

Wait, but when we turn off j, the positions j-1 and j+1 may be 1. So turning off j could create a new disturbance at j-1 or j+1.

For example: original array is 1 1 1. Suppose we turn off position 2 (so the array becomes 1 0 1). Then the middle position (2) is 0, and neighbors are 1. So it's a new disturbance.

So when we turn off j, we need to check whether doing so creates any new disturbances. So to prevent that, turning off j would require that either j-1 is 0, or j+1 is 0. Or, perhaps, that after turning off j, the positions j-2, j, j+2 are considered.

This seems very complex. So how can we model all these possibilities?

Alternative idea: For any position j that is turned off (i.e., in the selected set), we must ensure that any new disturbances caused by turning j off are also handled. So the selection of j may require that some other positions are also turned off.

But this could lead to a chain reaction, which is tricky to model.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to model this as a graph problem where each possible disturbance (existing or potential) must be covered by turning off certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem where we process the array from left to right, keeping track of the necessary state to avoid creating disturbances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to selecting a minimal set of positions to turn off such that:

1. For every existing disturbance (original 1 0 1 triplet), either the left or right is turned off.

2. For every position j turned off (originally 1), check that after turning it off, the positions j-1 and j+1 are not both 1. Because if they are, then j is now 0, creating a disturbance at j.

Wait, but j was turned off (so original a[j] was 1). So after turning it off, a[j] is 0. So if a[j-1] and a[j+1] are both 1 (in the original array), then turning j off would create a new disturbance at j. Unless those positions are also turned off.

Wait, but in the original array, a[j] was 1. So, for example, the original array could have a[j-1] = 1, a[j] = 1, a[j+1] = 1. So turning off j makes the array 1 0 1. Then, j becomes a disturbance. So we must avoid that.

So when we decide to turn off j, we need to make sure that either j-1 or j+1 is also turned off (if they were 1 in the original array). Otherwise, j becomes a disturbance.

Alternatively, perhaps turning off j is allowed only if either j-1 or j+1 is already 0 (in the original array) or will be turned off.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent conflicts. But I'm not sure.

Let's think of an example. Suppose the original array is 1 1 1. Then, to turn off the middle 1. Then the array becomes 1 0 1. This creates a disturbance at position 2. So we need to turn off either position 1 or 3. But if we turn off position 1 and 3, then the array becomes 0 0 0, which is okay. But that requires turning off 3 positions (original 1s) which is worse than other options.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way to approach this is to model the problem as a graph where each 1 in the array is a node, and edges connect nodes that are adjacent. Then, selecting nodes (turning them off) in such a way that any 3-node path (like 1-1-1) is broken by turning off either the middle or one of the ends. But this is vague.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this problem as a graph where for each possible disturbance (original or created), we need to cover it by turning off at least one of the two adjacent 1s.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think of another approach. Let's model the problem as follows:

The minimal number of 1s to turn off such that:

1. For every existing 1-0-1 triplet (i-1, i, i+1) in the original array, we turn off either i-1 or i+1 (since the middle is already 0, changing it is not possible).

2. For every 1 that is turned off (j), which was originally 1, check if in the original array, j-1 and j+1 are both 1. If so, then turning off j would create a new 1-0-1 triplet at j, so we need to turn off either j-1 or j+1.

But this creates dependencies. So each time we turn off a 1, we may need to turn off some others to prevent new disturbances.

But how can we model this?

This seems like a problem that can be reduced to a graph where each node is a 1 in the original array. Turning off a node j requires also turning off nodes j-1 or j+1 if they are 1. But this could lead to cycles, making the problem difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to greedily turn off 1s in such a way that each decision covers as many existing and potential disturbances as possible.

For example, when encountering an existing disturbance (1-0-1), we can choose to turn off the left or right 1. But turning off the left (i-1) may affect other disturbances.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is to model this as an interval covering problem, where each existing disturbance requires covering either left or right, and each potential disturbance (from turning off a 1) requires covering adjacent nodes.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the examples.

First example:

Input is 10 flats:

1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0

Original a array: indices 0-9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the problem statement. The problem says "i-th flat" with i from 1 to n. So the first example's array is 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 (for 10 elements). Let's process the initial disturbances.

Looking for positions i where 1 < i < n (so i ranges from 2 to 9-1=9-1=8 if 1-based. Wait, n is 10. So for 1-based indices, i ranges from 2 to 9 (since 1 < i < n, n is 10, so i < 10, so up to 9). Wait, the problem statement says "1 < i < n", but the original example's answer says in the first example, people in flats 2 and 7 can turn off their lights.

In the first example, the initial array is:

1 (1) 0 (1) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) → but wait the input is [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]. So indices 0-9 (0-based) for 10 elements.

In 1-based, the array is a1=1, a2=1, a3=0, a4=1, a5=1, a6=0, a7=1, a8=0, a9=1, a10=0.

The existing disturbances are where a[i-1] and a[i+1] are 1 and a[i] is 0. Let's check each possible i (from 2 to 9 in 1-based).

i=2: a1=1, a3=0. No.

i=3: a2=1, a4=1. a3=0. So yes, this is a disturbance. So i=3 is disturbed.

i=5: a4=1, a6=0. No.

i=7: a6=0, so no.

i=8: a7=1, a9=1. a8=0. So i=8 is a disturbance.

So in the original array, there are two disturbances: i=3 and i=8 (1-based).

To fix these, we need to turn off either i-1 or i+1 for each disturbance.

For disturbance at i=3 (1-based): turn off i=2 (a2) or i=4 (a4). Similarly for disturbance at i=8: turn off i=7 or i=9.

But turning off these positions may create new disturbances.

Wait, suppose we turn off a2 (original a2 is 1, turned to 0). Then, in the array, position 2 (0-based index 1) becomes 0.

Check if this creates any new disturbances. For i=2 (1-based index 3?), no. Wait, in 0-based:

Original array after turning off a2 (index 1):

Original a[1] was 1, now 0.

So the new array would be [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0].

Now, check for disturbances:

Looking at each i (0-based) from 1 to 8 (since 0-based, and n=10, so i from 1 to 8):

i=1: a0=1, a2=0. No.

i=2: a1=0, a3=1. No.

i=3: a2=0, a4=1. No.

i=4: a3=1, a5=0. No.

i=5: a4=1, a6=1. a5=0. So yes, this is a new disturbance at i=5 (0-based index 5, which is 1-based 6).

So turning off a2 (index 1) creates a new disturbance. So now we have to handle that.

So this approach requires not only handling the original disturbances but also any new ones introduced by turning off a 1.

This complicates the problem, because each decision can create new disturbances that need to be addressed.

So the problem is to find a set of 1s to turn off such that:

- For every original disturbance, either left or right is turned off.

- For every 1 turned off, if turning it off creates a disturbance (i.e., both left and right were 1), then either left or right is also turned off.

But how to model this?

Perhaps the key insight is that when you turn off a 1, you need to also turn off at least one adjacent 1 (if they exist) to prevent creating a disturbance.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find all the runs of consecutive 1s and handle them in such a way that no three consecutive 1s are left after turning off certain positions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the problem of placing guards in a graph to cover all edges, where each guard can cover certain edges. Or like the interval covering problem where each interval is a potential disturbance, and covering it requires selecting certain positions.

Alternatively, think of the array as a graph where each position is a node, and edges represent potential disturbances. But I'm not sure.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each existing disturbance (original 1-0-1) must be covered by turning off either left or right. Additionally, for each 1 turned off (say position j), if the original a[j-1] and a[j+1] are 1, then this creates a new disturbance at j. To prevent this, we need to turn off at least one of j-1 or j+1. But j-1 and j+1 may themselves be part of other disturbances.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a 1 in the original array. For each existing disturbance (original 1-0-1), the left and right 1s form a pair where at least one must be chosen. For each 1 that is chosen (turned off), if its left and right are 1s in the original array, then those left and right 1s must form a pair where at least one is chosen.

This seems to be a problem that can be modeled as a bipartite graph and solved using maximum matching, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a graph where edges represent the required constraints. For example:

- For an existing disturbance at position i (the 0 in a 1-0-1 triplet), we must choose between turning off i-1 or i+1. So create an edge between i-1 and i+1, meaning that at least one of them must be selected.

- For a 1 that is turned off (j), if the original a[j-1] and a[j+1] are 1s, then turning off j creates a new disturbance. So we must turn off either j-1 or j+1. So for this, create an edge between j-1 and j+1, requiring that at least one is selected.

But how to model this as a graph and find the minimal set of nodes to select such that all edges are covered (i.e., for each edge, at least one of the two nodes is selected). This is the classic vertex cover problem. But vertex cover is NP-hard in general graphs. However, for bipartite graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time using maximum matching. But the constraints here may not form a bipartite graph.

But since n is up to 100, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is to model this as a vertex cover problem on a graph constructed from these constraints and then find the minimal vertex cover. However, since vertex cover is NP-hard, this approach may not be feasible for n=100. But maybe the graph has some structure that allows for a polynomial solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a bipartite graph. For example, arrange the nodes in such a way that edges only connect nodes from two different partitions. Then, the vertex cover can be found using maximum flow.

But how to model the constraints properly.

Let me think again.

Each existing disturbance gives a constraint: (i-1) OR (i+1) must be chosen.

Each 1 that is chosen (j) and has a[j-1] and a[j+1] as 1s in the original array gives another constraint: (j-1) OR (j+1) must be chosen.

So all these constraints can be represented as edges in a graph where each edge is between two nodes, and the minimal vertex cover is the minimal number of nodes to select such that at least one node from each edge is selected.

This is exactly the vertex cover problem. However, since the graph can be arbitrary (not bipartite), finding a minimal vertex cover is computationally hard. But for n=100, even a O(2^n) approach is impossible.

But wait, n is up to 100. How can we find a solution here?

Alternatively, perhaps the graph has a certain structure that allows for a dynamic programming solution. For example, if the graph is a chain, like in a line, then a DP approach can be used.

Alternatively, considering that the constraints are between adjacent nodes (since each edge connects i-1 and i+1 for some i), perhaps the graph is a bipartite graph. Let's see.

For example, edges connect nodes i and i+2. So for even and odd positions, perhaps the graph is bipartitioned.

Suppose all nodes are arranged in such a way that even and odd nodes form two partitions. Then, edges would connect nodes from even to even, or odd to odd, which would not form a bipartition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the edges are between nodes i and i+2. For example, in the first example, the existing disturbance at position 3 (1-based) requires choosing between 2 and 4. These are even and even (since 2 and 4 are even). So the edge is between 2 and 4. Then, the new disturbance when turning off 2 would require choosing between 1 and 3. But 1 is odd, 3 is even. So edges between odd and even. This would imply that the graph is bipartite.

If the graph is bipartite, then the vertex cover can be found in polynomial time using maximum matching. But how to determine whether the graph is bipartite.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is bipartite. Because each edge connects two nodes that are two apart (i and i+2). Then, nodes can be partitioned into even and odd indices. So edges would connect nodes of the same parity. For example, edge between 2 and 4 (even), edge between 4 and 6 (even). Similarly, edge between 1 and 3 (odd and even? No, 1 is odd, 3 is odd. So 1 and 3 are in the same partition. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, 1 and 3 are two apart. So 1 is odd, 3 is also odd. So edges can connect nodes of the same parity. So if we model the graph as a bipartition between even and odd, the edges would be within the same partition. Which makes the graph not bipartite. Because in bipartite graphs, edges can only connect between partitions.

So this approach is not possible.

Hmm. So given that the vertex cover approach is NP-hard, and n is up to 100, perhaps we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: Greedily choose the best option.

But greedy approaches can fail. For example, choosing to turn off the right option for a disturbance may lead to more required selections.

But perhaps in practice, for the given problem constraints, a dynamic programming approach could work, considering the positions in order.

Wait, considering that the problem is on a line (array), perhaps a dynamic programming approach that tracks the last few positions and whether they were turned off could be possible.

Let's model the DP state as follows: for each position i (which is a 1 in the original array), decide whether to turn it off or not, keeping track of the necessary conditions to avoid disturbances.

But the problem is that turning off a position can affect the next positions. For example, turning off i may require turning off i+2 (if i+1 is 1 and i+2 is 1).

Alternatively, think of the array as a sequence of 1s and 0s. We need to process the 1s and decide which to turn off, ensuring that:

- For every existing disturbance (original 1-0-1), at least one of the neighboring 1s is turned off.

- For every 1 turned off (j), if j-1 and j+1 are 1s in the original array, then at least one of them is turned off.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal set of positions to turn off can be found by considering overlapping intervals. For example, each existing or potential disturbance requires covering certain positions, and overlapping intervals can be handled optimally.

Wait, perhaps this problem can be transformed into a problem similar to interval covering. Let's see.

Each existing disturbance (original 1-0-1) requires that either the left (i-1) or right (i+1) is turned off. So this is a choice between two positions.

Each potential disturbance (turning off j) requires that if j-1 and j+1 are 1s in the original array, then either j-1 or j+1 is turned off. So this is again a choice between two positions.

Thus, all these constraints can be modeled as pairs (edges) between the left and right positions. The minimal vertex cover of this graph would give the minimal number of positions to turn off.

But since the graph is formed by edges between pairs, the vertex cover is the minimal set of nodes that covers all edges. However, vertex cover is NP-hard in general, but for bipartite graphs, there's a solution using maximum matching. However, since our graph may not be bipartite, this approach may not work.

But wait, perhaps the edges are all between positions that are two units apart, which could form a bipartite graph.

For example, edges are between positions i and i+2. Let's see: suppose positions are even and odd. For example, i=2 and i+2=4 (even and even), so same parity. Or i=3 and i+2=5 (odd and odd). So edges connect nodes of the same parity. So the graph is made up of edges within even nodes and edges within odd nodes. So this is not a bipartite graph. Therefore, the bipartition approach won't work.

This suggests that the vertex cover approach is not feasible for n=100.

Alternative idea: Let's model this as an independent set problem. Since vertex cover is the complement of an independent set, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph by creating two nodes for each position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two separate problems: one for even positions and one for odd positions. Because edges are between positions of the same parity, so the graph is split into even and odd components. Then, solving each component separately.

For example, for even positions, all edges are between even positions, so their graph is a collection of edges between even nodes. Similarly for odd positions.

Then, the vertex cover for even positions can be found using maximum matching (if the graph is bipartite), but even that may not be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is bipartite for each parity.

Wait, for even parity nodes: edges are between nodes i and j where i and j are even. But how can edges be arranged here? For example, a node 2 and node 4 are connected because there's a disturbance between them. Then, node 4 and node 6 are connected, etc. This forms a path graph where each node is even. The path graph is bipartite. For example, nodes 2, 4, 6 can be divided into two sets: {2,6} and {4}. Each edge connects a node from the first set to the second. So in this case, the maximum matching can be found.

But perhaps the graph for each parity (even and odd) is bipartite, allowing the use of Konig's theorem to find the minimal vertex cover.

If that's the case, then for each parity, we can compute the vertex cover, and sum them.

But how to split the graph into even and odd components.

Alternatively, the edges for even parity form a graph where each edge is between even nodes, and similarly for odd. Then, each of these subgraphs can be processed separately.

So, the minimal vertex cover would be the sum of the minimal vertex covers for the even and odd subgraphs.

But how to verify this.

For example, suppose we have two edges: (2,4) and (4,6) in the even subgraph. The minimal vertex cover would be nodes 4, which covers both edges. So the size is 1. For the even subgraph, this is possible.

Similarly, for the odd subgraph, edges like (1,3) and (3,5) would be covered by node 3.

Thus, splitting into even and odd subgraphs and solving each separately could work.

But how to model the edges.

So the approach would be:

1. For each existing disturbance, create an edge between (i-1) and (i+1).

2. For each 1 in the original array, check if turning it off (j) would create a disturbance (i.e., j-1 and j+1 are both 1 in the original array). If so, create an edge between (j-1) and (j+1).

Then, for each edge (u, v), we need to select at least one of u or v in the vertex cover.

The minimal vertex cover for this graph is the minimal number of 1s to turn off to satisfy all constraints.

But since the graph can be split into even and odd subgraphs (edges are between even nodes or between odd nodes), then each subgraph is a bipartite graph.

Wait, if edges are between even nodes (u and v are even), then the subgraph for even nodes is a graph where each edge connects even nodes. How can this be bipartite? Well, for example, in a chain of even nodes (2-4-6), the edges are 2-4, 4-6. The graph is a path of three nodes, which is bipartite. The bipartition would be {2,6} and {4}. So the minimal vertex cover is 1 (node 4). So Konig's theorem applies here.

Thus, for each even subgraph and odd subgraph, we can compute the minimal vertex cover using maximum bipartite matching.

So the steps are:

- Build the graph of constraints (edges between pairs of nodes).

- Split the graph into even and odd subgraphs.

- For each subgraph, compute the minimal vertex cover using Konig's theorem (maximum matching in bipartite graphs).

- Sum the minimal vertex covers of both subgraphs.

But how to implement this.

First, we need to build the edges.

First, collect all existing disturbances. For each such disturbance, create an edge between i-1 and i+1 (1-based indices).

Then, for each j that is a 1 in the original array, check if turning j off would create a disturbance. That is, check if j-1 and j+1 (original) are both 1. If so, then turning j off would create a disturbance at j. So to prevent this, we need to turn off either j-1 or j+1. Thus, add an edge between j-1 and j+1.

Once all edges are added, split them into even and odd subgraphs.

For each subgraph (even or odd), model the nodes and edges. Then, find the maximum matching, and the minimal vertex cover is the size of the maximum matching (per Konig's theorem for bipartite graphs).

Wait, but Konig's theorem states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimal vertex cover. So yes.

Thus, for each subgraph (even and odd), compute the maximum matching. The sum of those is the minimal vertex cover size.

But wait, no. Konig's theorem states that the size of the minimal vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching in bipartite graphs. So for each even subgraph, compute the maximum matching, which gives the minimal vertex cover for that subgraph. Similarly for the odd subgraph. The sum of these two gives the total minimal vertex cover for the entire graph.

Thus, this approach would work.

So the steps are:

1. Collect all edges from existing disturbances and potential disturbances caused by turning off a 1.

2. Split the edges into even and odd subgraphs (based on the parity of the nodes in the edge).

3. For each subgraph, model it as a bipartite graph (even subgraph and odd subgraph may each be bipartite).

4. Compute maximum matching for each bipartite subgraph, then the minimal vertex cover for each is equal to the maximum matching size.

5. The sum of the two minimal vertex covers is the answer.

Now, the key is to model each subgraph as a bipartite graph. But how?

For example, for the even subgraph: nodes are even positions.

Each edge connects two even positions. How to split them into two partitions.

Wait, even positions can be arranged in a chain. For example, 2, 4, 6, 8. Edges may be between consecutive nodes, like 2-4, 4-6, etc. Or edges may connect nodes further apart.

But to form a bipartition, we can split the even positions into two groups based on their index modulo 4. For example, even indices can be split into those congruent to 0 mod 4 and 2 mod 4. Then, edges in the even subgraph would connect nodes between these two groups.

But how to verify this.

Alternatively, for even nodes, arrange them in a way that each node is connected to its next even node. For example, 2 and 4 are connected, 4 and 6 are connected. The graph becomes a path. A path is bipartite, as you can alternate grouping nodes.

So for even nodes, the subgraph is a bipartite graph. Similarly for odd nodes.

Thus, for each subgraph (even and odd), it's a bipartite graph, so we can apply Konig's theorem.

Thus, the algorithm is as follows:

- Build all edges for existing disturbances and potential disturbances.

- For each edge (u, v), check the parity of u. Since u and v are two apart (because each edge is between nodes i-1 and i+1 for some i), their parity is the same. For example, i-1 and i+1 are both even or both odd.

- Split the edges into even and odd subgraphs.

- For each subgraph, model it as a bipartite graph and compute the maximum matching. The minimal vertex cover for that subgraph is equal to the maximum matching.

- Sum the two minimal vertex covers to get the answer.

Now, how to implement this.

First, collect all edges.

For existing disturbances:

Loop through each position i (1-based) from 2 to n-1.

For each i, check if a[i-2] is 1 (i-1 in 1-based is i-2 in 0-based), a[i-1] is 0, a[i] is 1.

If so, add an edge between (i-1) and (i+1) (1-based indices).

Wait, no. Wait, for a disturbance at position i (1-based), the triplet is a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1]. So i is between 2 and n-1.

Wait, in the problem statement, disturbed people are at positions i where 1 < i < n (1-based). So i ranges from 2 to n-1 (1-based). For each such i, if a[i-1] = 1 (i-1 in 1-based), a[i] = 0, a[i+1] = 1 (i+1 in 1-based), then it's a disturbance.

So the two positions are (i-1) and (i+1) in 1-based indices. So in the original array, these are the positions to the left and right of the disturbed i.

Thus, for each existing disturbance, add an edge between (i-1) and (i+1) (1-based).

For potential disturbances:

For each j in 1-based indices (1 to n) where a[j] is 1, check if a[j-1] and a[j+1] (original) are both 1. If so, then turning j off would create a disturbance at j (since j becomes 0, and j-1 and j+1 are 1). So to prevent this, we need to add an edge between (j-1) and (j+1) (1-based).

So for each j in 1-based indices where a[j] is 1, and j is not the first or last position (since j-1 and j+1 must be valid), check if a[j-1] and a[j+1] are 1. If so, add an edge between (j-1) and (j+1).

Now, after collecting all edges, split them into even and odd subgraphs based on the parity of the nodes in the edge. For example, an edge between 2 and 4 (both even) is added to the even subgraph. An edge between 3 and 5 (both odd) is added to the odd subgraph.

Once the edges are split, each subgraph is bipartite, and we can compute the maximum matching for each.

The maximum matching can be computed using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for bipartite graphs.

Once the maximum matching for each subgraph is found, the minimal vertex cover for each subgraph is equal to the size of the maximum matching.

Thus, the answer is the sum of the minimal vertex covers for the even and odd subgraphs.

Now, how to model the bipartition for each subgraph.

For the even subgraph:

The nodes are even numbers. To model them as a bipartite graph, we can split the even nodes into two groups: those congruent to 0 mod 4 and 2 mod 4.

For example:

Even nodes: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.

Split into group A (2, 6, 10, ...) and group B (4, 8, 12, ...). Then, edges in the even subgraph (like 2-4, 4-6) will connect group A and group B. Thus, the even subgraph is bipartite.

Similarly for the odd subgraph: nodes are odd numbers. Split into group A (1, 5, 9, ...) and group B (3, 7, 11, ...). Edges like 1-3, 3-5 will connect group A and B.

Thus, each subgraph is bipartite, and Hopcroft-Karp can be used.

Now, the code steps:

1. Read n and a array (0-based in code, but 1-based in problem statement).

2. Collect edges for existing disturbances.

3. Collect edges for potential disturbances.

4. Split edges into even and odd subgraphs.

5. For each subgraph, model as a bipartite graph and compute maximum matching.

6. Sum the maximum matchings for even and odd subgraphs. That is the answer.

So the code will need to:

- Represent the edges for each subgraph.

- For each subgraph, build the adjacency list.

- Run Hopcroft-Karp to find maximum matching.

Now, implementing Hopcroft-Karp in Python.

But wait, for n up to 100, the number of nodes in each subgraph is up to 50 (since 100 even or odd nodes). So Hopcroft-Karp is feasible.

Now, let's code this.

But first, collect all edges.

For example, in code:

- Convert the input to 1-based indices.

For existing disturbances:

for i in 2 to n-1 (1-based):

   if a[i-1] == 0 and a[i-2] == 1 and a[i] == 1:

       add edge (i-2 +1, i +1 -1) ?

Wait, no. Let's see. For a disturbance at position i (1-based), the left is i-1, the right is i+1 (both 1-based). So in 1-based indices, left is i-1, right is i+1.

So for example, i=3 (1-based), then left is 2 (1-based), right is 4 (1-based).

Thus, the edge is (2,4).

Similarly, for a potential disturbance when turning off j (1-based) which was originally 1, and j-1 and j+1 (1-based) are both 1, then the edge is (j-1, j+1).

Now, collect all edges.

Once edges are collected, split them into even and odd.

For each edge (u, v):

if u is even:

   add to even_edges.

else:

   add to odd_edges.

Now, for even_edges and odd_edges, build the bipartite graphs.

For even_edges:

Split the even nodes into two groups based on u mod 4. For example:

Group 0: even nodes where u % 4 == 2 (since 2 mod 4 is 2, 6 mod 4 is 2, etc.)

Group 1: even nodes where u % 4 == 0 (4 mod 4 is 0, 8 mod 4 is 0, etc.)

Then, edges in even_edges are between group 0 and group 1.

Similarly for odd_edges:

Split into group 0 (1,5,9,...) and group 1 (3,7,11,...).

Thus, edges in odd_edges are between group 0 and group 1.

So the code can model each subgraph as a bipartite graph between two groups.

Now, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can be implemented for each bipartite graph.

Now, let's think about how to code this.

First, collect the edges.

Then, for each subgraph (even and odd):

   collect all unique nodes in the edges.

   split into left and right partitions based on mod 4 (for even) or mod 4 (for odd).

   build adjacency lists for each node in the left partition.

Then, run Hopcroft-Karp to find the maximum matching.

The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for bipartite graphs involves BFS to compute layers and then DFS to find augmenting paths. It's efficient for large graphs.

But implementing Hopcroft-Karp requires some effort.

Once we have the maximum matching for each subgraph, sum them for the answer.

Now, let's code this.

First, read input.

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

Now, collect edges.

edges = []

# existing disturbances

for i in range(1, n-1):  # 0-based, corresponds to 1-based i+1 between 2 and n-1.

   # i is 0-based. So 1-based position is i+1.

   # So in 1-based, i ranges from 2 to n-1.

   # a[i] is the middle element.

   if a[i] == 0:

       # check left and right

       left = a[i-1]

       right = a[i+1]

       if left == 1 and right == 1:

           # existing disturbance at i (0-based) which is 1-based i+1.

           # edge is between (i) and (i+2) in 0-based? Wait no.

           # In 1-based, left is (i) in 0-based +1 ?

           # Wait, in 1-based, the position of the disturbance is i+1.

           # So the left and right are (i) and (i+2) in 1-based.

           # So in 1-based, left is (i), right is (i+2).

           # So their 1-based indices are u = i, v = i+2.

           # So the edge is between u and v (1-based).

           # So in 0-based, u-1 and v-1.

           # For example, if i is 1-based, then u is i-1+1 = i.

           # Wait, this is getting confusing.

           # Let's re-express:

           # in 1-based, the disturbance is at position i.

           # So i ranges from 2 to n-1.

           # For each such i, if a[i-1] is 0 (in 1-based), but the problem states a_i is 0.

           # Wait, the problem states that a_i =0 and a_{i-1}=a_{i+1}=1.

           # So in 1-based, the disturbance is at i where a_i=0, a_{i-1}=1, a_{i+1}=1.

           # So in 0-based terms, this is at position i-1 (if 1-based i is the index).

           # So for 1-based i in 2 to n-1:

           # in 0-based, the position is i-1.

           # So in code:

           # for i_1based in 2 to n-1 (inclusive):

           #   0-based i = i_1based -1

           #   if a[i] ==0 and a[i-1] ==1 and a[i+1] ==1:

           #       add edge between (i_1based-1) and (i_1based+1) in 1-based.

           # So for the existing disturbance at 1-based i, add edge between (i-1) and (i+1) in 1-based.

           # For example, if i is 3 (1-based), then edge is between 2 and 4.

           # So in code:

           u_1based = (i)  # 0-based i is the middle of the triplet. So left is i-1+1 = i in 0-based.

           # Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up between 0-based and 1-based.

           # Let's take an example.

           # For the existing disturbance in the first example: the input array is 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 (0-based 0-9).

           # The existing disturbances are at 0-based 2 (1-based 3), which is 0, with left 1 (0-based 1) and right 1 (0-based 3). So in 1-based, left is 2, right is 4. So edge between 2 and 4.

           # So in code, when i is 2 (0-based), the current a[i] is 0, a[i-1] is 1 (0-based 1), a[i+1] is 1 (0-based 3). So we add an edge between (i-1+1) and (i+1+1) in 1-based.

           # i-1 in 0-based is 1 → 1-based is 2. i+1 in 0-based is 3 → 1-based is 4.

           # So the edge is (2,4).

           # So code:

           left_1based = (i)  # 0-based i-1 is (i-1), which in 1-based is (i-1)+1 = i.

           right_1based = (i+2)  # 0-based i+1 is (i+1), which in 1-based is (i+1)+1 = i+2.

           edges.append( (left_1based, right_1based) )

           # Or wait, no. i is 0-based. The current position is i.

           # a[i] is 0. So the disturbance is at i+1 in 1-based.

           # So the left is i (0-based) which is 1-based i+1-1 = i.

           # Wait, no. For the disturbance at 1-based i, the left is i-1, right is i+1.

           # So for 0-based i, the disturbance is at 1-based (i+1).

           # So the left and right in 1-based are (i+1-1) = i and (i+1+1) = i+2.

           # So yes, the edge is between i and i+2 in 1-based.

So for each existing disturbance (i is 0-based), the edge is between (i) and (i+2) in 1-based indices.

So the code for existing disturbances is:

for i in range(n):

   if i < 1 or i >= n-1:

       continue  # can't be a disturbance

   if a[i] == 0 and a[i-1] == 1 and a[i+1] == 1:

       u = i  # 0-based i-1 is left (i-1 is 0-based) → 1-based is i.

       v = i + 2  # 0-based i+1 is right (i+1 in 0-based is i+1, 1-based is i+2.

       edges.append( (u, v) )

Wait, no. For example, i is 2 (0-based), a[i] is 0. a[1] =1, a[3]=1. So the disturbance is at 1-based 3. The left is 1-based 2 (0-based 1), the right is 1-based 4 (0-based 3). So the edge is between 2 and 4 (1-based). Which in code would be u=2, v=4.

But in code, for i=2 (0-based), the code would compute u = i = 2 (0-based), v = i+2 = 4 (0-based) → no, that's not right.

Wait, no. The code in the current setup is using 1-based indices for the edges. So when the code finds a disturbance at 0-based i, it needs to add an edge between the left and right in 1-based indices.

So for 0-based i, the left is 0-based i-1 → 1-based (i-1 +1) = i. The right is 0-based i+1 → 1-based (i+1 +1) = i+2.

So the edge is between i (1-based) and i+2 (1-based).

So in code, for the existing disturbance at 0-based i (where 1 <= i < n-1):

edges.append( (i, i+2) )

But since i is 0-based, the 1-based index for the left is i (0-based i-1 → 1-based i-1 +1 = i). The right is 0-based i+1 → 1-based i+1 +1 = i+2.

Yes.

So code for existing disturbances:

for i in range(1, n-1):

   if a[i] == 0 and a[i-1] == 1 and a[i+1] == 1:

       u = i  # 1-based left (i-1 + 1 = i)

       v = i + 2  # 1-based right (i+1 + 1 = i+2)

       edges.append( (u, v) )

Now for potential disturbances.

For each j in 1-based indices (1 to n), where a[j-1] ==1 (0-based j-1 is 1-based j).

Wait, the original a[j] (0-based j-1) is 1. We need to check if j-1 and j+1 (1-based) are both 1.

So in code:

for j_1based in range(1, n+1):

   j_0based = j_1based - 1

   if a[j_0based] == 1:

       # check if j_1based is not the first or last

       if j_1based == 1 or j_1based == n:

           continue

       # check j-1 and j+1 (1-based) are 1.

       left_j = j_1based -1

       right_j = j_1based +1

       left_0based = left_j -1

       right_0based = right_j -1

       if left_j >=1 and right_j <=n:

           if a[left_0based] ==1 and a[right_0based] ==1:

               # turning off j_1based would create a disturbance at j_1based.

               # So add edge between (left_j, right_j) in 1-based.

               edges.append( (left_j, right_j) )

So for j_1based, if it's 1 in the original array, and its left and right (1-based) are both 1, then turning off j_1based creates a disturbance. Thus, we need to add an edge between left_j and right_j.

Once all edges are collected, split them into even and odd.

even_edges = []

odd_edges = []

for u, v in edges:

   if u % 2 ==0 and v %2 ==0:

       even_edges.append( (u, v) )

   elif u %2 ==1 and v%2 ==1:

       odd_edges.append( (u, v) )

But wait, since u and v are two apart (like j-1 and j+1), their parity must be the same. So for example, if j is even, j-1 and j+1 are odd. If j is odd, j-1 and j+1 are even. Wait, no. Let's see:

j_1based can be any position. For example, j is 3 (1-based). j-1 is 2 (even), j+1 is 4 (even). So edge is between 2 and 4, both even.

If j is 4 (1-based), j-1 is 3 (odd), j+1 is 5 (odd). Edge is between 3 and 5, both odd.

So for any edge (u, v) added, u and v have the same parity.

Thus, edges can be split into even and odd.

Thus, in code:

for u, v in edges:

   if u %2 ==0:

       even_edges.append( (u, v) )

   else:

       odd_edges.append( (u, v) )

Because u and v are even or odd.

Now, for each subgraph (even_edges and odd_edges), build the bipartite graph and compute maximum matching.

Now, how to model the bipartite graph.

For even_edges:

Each node is even. Split them into two groups:

Group A: even nodes where u %4 == 2.

Group B: even nodes where u %4 == 0.

For example, u=2 → 2 mod4=2 → group A.

u=4 → 0 mod4 → group B.

u=6 → 2 mod4 → group A.

Thus, edges in even_edges are between group A and group B.

Similarly for odd_edges:

Group A: odd nodes where u mod4 == 1 (like 1, 5, 9).

Group B: odd nodes where u mod4 == 3 (like 3,7, 11).

Thus, edges in odd_edges are between group A and group B.

Thus, for each subgraph, the bipartition is possible.

Now, to model the bipartition, for each node u in even_edges:

if u %4 == 2 → left partition.

else → right partition.

For each node u in odd_edges:

if u %4 == 1 → left partition.

else → right partition.

Thus, for the even subgraph:

left_nodes = {u for u in even_nodes if u %4 == 2}

right_nodes = {u for u in even_nodes if u %4 ==0}

For the odd subgraph:

left_nodes = {u for u in odd_nodes if u %4 ==1}

right_nodes = {u for u in odd_nodes if u %4 ==3}

Now, build the adjacency list for each bipartition.

Once the adjacency list is built, run Hopcroft-Karp to find maximum matching.

Now, let's code the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.

The algorithm maintains a pairing for each node in the right partition. It uses BFS to find layers of nodes and then DFS to find augmenting paths.

The code for Hopcroft-Karp is somewhat long, but can be implemented as follows.

First, collect all nodes in even_edges and odd_edges.

For even_edges:

even_nodes = set()

for u, v in even_edges:

   even_nodes.add(u)

   even_nodes.add(v)

even_nodes = sorted(list(even_nodes))

For each node in even_nodes, assign to left or right partition.

Similarly for odd_edges.

But this may not be necessary. Instead, for each node u in the edges of the even subgraph:

if u %4 == 2 → left.

else → right.

Similarly for odd subgraph.

So, for even_edges:

left = set()

right = set()

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2:

       left.add(u)

       right.add(v)

   else:

       left.add(v)

       right.add(u)

But this may not cover all nodes. So perhaps it's better to check each node.

Alternatively, for a given node u in even_edges:

if u %4 == 2 → left.

else → right.

Thus, for even_edges:

graph = defaultdict(list)

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2:

       graph[u].append(v)

   else:

       graph[v].append(u)

But no. We need to model the adjacency list for left nodes to right nodes.

Thus, for even_edges:

adj = defaultdict(list)

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2 and v %4 == 0:

       adj[u].append(v)

   elif v %4 == 2 and u %4 ==0:

       adj[v].append(u)

   else:

       # this is impossible as u and v are even.

       # but perhaps there's a mistake.

       pass

Alternatively, for each edge in even_edges:

if u is in left (u %4 == 2), then add to adj[u] → v (which is in right).

else, if v is in left, add to adj[v] → u.

But this is redundant.

Alternatively, create a bipartition where even nodes with u %4 == 2 are in left, others in right.

Thus:

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u in left_partition:

       adj[u].append(v)

   else:

       adj[v].append(u)

Wait, perhaps not.

The correct way is to assign left and right partitions based on u mod4.

For even_edges, for each u:

if u %4 == 2 → left.

else (u %4 ==0 or u%4 == other) → right.

Wait, even_edges are even nodes. So u can be 2,4,6,8, etc. 2 mod4 is 2, 4 mod4 is 0, 6 mod4 is 2, 8 mod4 is 0, etc.

Thus, the left partition consists of even nodes with u mod4 == 2.

The right partition consists of even nodes with u mod4 ==0.

Thus, for even_edges, the bipartition is left (mod4 ==2) and right (mod4 ==0).

Thus, for an edge (u, v) in even_edges, one must be mod4 2 and the other mod4 0.

But since u and v are even and two apart (since edges are between i-1 and i+1 for some i), u and v are two apart.

For example, 2 and 4: 2 mod4 is 2, 4 mod4 is 0. Edge is between left and right.

Another example, 4 and 6: 4 mod4 is 0, 6 mod4 is 2. Edge is between right and left.

Thus, for even_edges, each edge connects left and right partitions.

Thus, the bipartition is valid.

So for each even edge (u, v):

if u is in the left (mod4 ==2), then add u →v.

else, v is in the left (mod4 ==2), add v → u.

But since the edges can be either 2-4, 4-6, etc., we need to process them properly.

But in code, for each edge in even_edges:

u, v = edge

if u %4 == 2 and v %4 ==0:

   adj[u].append(v)

elif v %4 ==2 and u%4 ==0:

   adj[v].append(u)

else:

   # invalid edge, but according to problem constraints, this cannot happen.

Thus, the adjacency list can be built.

Similarly for odd_edges.

Now, Hopcroft-Karp implementation.

The code for Hopcroft-Karp is as follows:

def hopcroft_karp(graph, left_nodes):

   pair_u = {}

   pair_v = {}

   dist = {}

   for u in left_nodes:

       pair_u[u] = None

   for v in graph.values():

       for node in v:

           pair_v[node] = None

   def bfs():

       queue = deque()

       for u in left_nodes:

           if pair_u[u] is None:

               dist[u] = 0

               queue.append(u)

           else:

               dist[u] = float('inf')

       dist[None] = float('inf')

       while queue:

           u = queue.popleft()

           if u is not None:

               for v in graph.get(u, []):

                   if dist.get(pair_v[v], float('inf')) == float('inf'):

                       dist[pair_v[v]] = dist[u] + 1

                       queue.append(pair_v[v])

       return dist[None] != float('inf')

   def dfs(u):

       if u is not None:

           for v in graph.get(u, []:

               if dist.get(pair_v[v], float('inf')) == dist[u] + 1:

                   if dfs(pair_v[v]):

                       pair_u[u] = v

                       pair_v[v] = u

                       return True

           dist[u] = float('inf')

           return False

       return True

   result = 0

   while bfs():

       for u in left_nodes:

           if pair_u[u] is None:

               if dfs(u):

                   result +=1

   return result

But this code may have some errors. So implementing Hopcroft-Karp correctly is crucial.

Alternatively, use a standard implementation.

But given time constraints, perhaps using a simpler BFS-based approach for maximum bipartite matching.

Alternatively, use the standard DFS-based approach for maximum bipartite matching, which is O(VE), but for n=50, this is manageable.

But for n=50, O(VE) could be 50*50*50 = 125,000 steps, which is manageable.

Thus, implementing a simple maximum bipartite matching via DFS.

The code for maximum matching using DFS:

def max_matching(graph, left_nodes):

   match_to = {}  # for right nodes, their match.

   used = {}

   def dfs(u):

       used[u] = True

       for v in graph.get(u, []:

           if v not in match_to or (not used.get(match_to[v], False) and dfs(match_to[v])):

               match_to[v] = u

               return True

       return False

   result =0

   for u in left_nodes:

       used = defaultdict(bool)

       if dfs(u):

           result +=1

   return result

But this is O(VE) and may be too slow for n=50. But for n=50 and E=50, it's 50*50=2500 steps, which is acceptable.

But for Hopcroft-Karp, the code is more efficient.

But for the purposes of this problem, given the small constraints (n=100), even a O(VE) approach may work.

Thus, for each subgraph, build the adjacency list, collect the left nodes, and compute the maximum matching.

Once the maximum matching is computed, sum the even and odd matchings to get the answer.

Now, putting it all together.

The code:

Read the input, collect edges.

Split into even and odd.

For each subgraph:

   build adjacency list.

   collect left nodes.

   compute maximum matching.

Sum and print.

But how to build the adjacency list.

For even_edges:

left_nodes = {u for u, v in even_edges if u %4 == 2}

for u in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2:

       left_nodes.add(u)

Similarly for right nodes.

But perhaps, for each even edge, check if u is in the left partition (mod4 == 2) and add to adjacency list.

Alternatively, for each edge in even_edges:

u, v = edge

if u %4 == 2:

   adj_even[u].append(v)

else:

   adj_even[v].append(u)

Thus, adj_even contains edges from left to right.

Thus, the left_nodes for even subgraph are all nodes in adj_even's keys.

Similarly for odd_edges.

Thus, code:

from collections import defaultdict, deque

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

edges = []

# Existing disturbances

for i in range(1, n-1):

   if a[i] == 0 and a[i-1] == 1 and a[i+1] == 1:

   j_0based = j_1based - 1

   if a[j_0based] == 1:

           continue

       left_j_1based = j_1based - 1

   return matching

even_matching = max_bipartite_matching(even_edges)

odd_matching = max_bipartite_matching(odd_edges)

print(even_matching + odd_matching)

But this code may have bugs. For example, the way edges are split into left and right partitions may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the code for max_bipartite_matching is not properly splitting the left and right partitions.

Another approach is to process each edge and add it to the adjacency list based on whether the node is in the left partition.

For even_edges:

adj = defaultdict(list)

left_nodes = set()

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2:

       adj[u].append(v)

       left_nodes.add(u)

   else:

       # check if v is in left partition.

       if v %4 == 2:

           adj[v].append(u)

           left_nodes.add(v)

But this may not be correct, because for even_edges, the edges are between nodes in the even subgraph (even indices), and the left partition is those even nodes where mod4 is 2.

For example, edge (2,4):

u=2 is mod4 2 → left. v=4 is mod4 0 → right. So add u → v.

For edge (4,6):

u=4 is mod4 0 → right. v=6 is mod4 2 → left. So add v → u.

Thus, adj should have 2 →4, 6 →4, etc.

Thus, the adjacency list is built correctly.

For each even_edge, if u is in left (mod4 2), add u→v. If v is in left, add v →u.

But in code:

for u, v in even_edges:

   if u %4 == 2:

       adj[u].append(v)

       left_nodes.add(u)

   elif v %4 == 2:

       adj[v].append(u)

       left_nodes.add(v)

But this may not cover all edges. For example, if both u and v are in left, which is impossible since u and v are two apart.

Thus, this code should work.

Similarly for odd_edges.

Thus, the code for max_bipartite_matching should be:

def max_bipartite_matching(edges, is_even):

   adj = defaultdict(list)

   left_nodes = set()

   for u, v in edges:

       if is_even:

           if u %4 == 2:

               adj[u].append(v)

               left_nodes.add(u)

           elif v %4 == 2:

               adj[v].append(u)

               left_nodes.add(v)

       else:

           if u %4 == 1:

               adj[u].append(v)

               left_nodes.add(u)

           elif v %4 == 1:

               adj[v].append(u)

               left_nodes.add(v)

   # Hopcroft-Karp code.

   # ... same as before.

But integrating this into the code.

But in any case, given the time constraints and the problem's small input size, perhaps the code can be written as follows.

But given the complexity of the code, perhaps there is a simpler approach.

Alternative approach:

We can model the problem as a graph where each constraint is an edge between two nodes. The minimal vertex cover is the answer.

But for each edge in the graph, which represents a constraint that at least one of the two nodes must be selected.

The minimal vertex cover for this graph is the minimal number of nodes to select.

But given that each edge is between nodes of the same parity, we can split the graph into even and odd subgraphs, each being a bipartite graph.

Thus, the minimal vertex cover for each subgraph is the maximum matching for that subgraph.

Thus, the code should correctly compute the sum of the maximum matchings for even and odd subgraphs.

Thus, the code as written, with Hopcroft-Karp for each subgraph, should work.

But given time, let's test the code with the first example.

First example:

Input:

10

1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0

Original array (0-based):

Indices 0-9: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0]

Existing disturbances:

i ranges from 1 to 8 (0-based) because 1 <=i < n-1 → 1<=i <=8 (n=10).

For i=2 (0-based):

a[i] =0. a[1] =1, a[3]=1 → disturbance. edge between 2 and 4 (1-based). So 1-based i=3 (0-based 2).

u=2, v=4 (1-based).

For i=7 (0-based):

a[i]=0. a[6] =1, a[8] =1 → disturbance. edge between 7 and 9 (1-based i=8: 1-based 8 is 0-based 7+1=8? No. Wait, i is 7 (0-based). a[i] is 0. a[i-1] =1 (i-1=6), a[i+1] =1 (i+1=8). So disturbance at 0-based 7. Edge between 7+1-1=7-1+1 =7 (0-based i-1 is 6, 1-based is 7). 7 (0-based i-1 is 6 → 1-based 7? No.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's re-calculate.

For existing disturbances:

For each 0-based i in [1, 8] (since i <n-1 → i <9):

For i=2 (0-based):

a[i] =0.

a[i-1] =a[1] =1.

a[i+1] =a[3] =1.

So disturbance at i=2 (0-based), which is 1-based i+1 =3.

Thus, edge between 2 (1-based) and 4 (1-based).

For i=7 (0-based):

a[7] =0.

a[6] =1, a[8] =1.

So disturbance at i=7 (0-based), 1-based i+1 =8.

Edge between 7 (1-based) and 9 (1-based).

Thus, edges are (2,4) and (7,9).

Potential disturbances:

For each j_1based where a[j_1based-1] is 1.

For j_1based=2 (0-based 1):

Check if j-1 and j+1 (1-based) are 1.

j=2: j-1=1, j+1=3.

a[0] =1, a[2] =0. So no.

For j_1based=4 (0-based 3):

a[3] is 1.

Check j-1=3, j+1=5 (1-based).

a[2] (3-1=2, 0-based) is 0. So no.

For j_1based=7 (0-based 6):

a[6] is 0. So no.

For j_1based=9 (0-based 8):

a[8] is 1.

Check j-1=8 and j+1=10 (n=10, j+1=10 is valid? No, since n=10. So j+1=10 is invalid. So skip.

So no potential disturbances.

Thus, the edges are (2,4), (7,9).

These are even edges (2 mod2=0, 4 mod2=0; 7 mod2=1,9 mod2=1).

Thus, even_edges has (2,4), odd_edges has (7,9).

For even_edges:

Each node is even. 2 mod4=2, 4 mod4=0. So edge between left and right.

Thus, the maximum matching for even_edges is 1 (select either 2 or 4).

For odd_edges:

7 mod4=3, 9 mod4=1. So 7 is in right partition (mod4=3), 9 is in left (mod4=1).

Thus, edge between 7 and 9 is between right and left. So maximum matching is 1.

Thus, sum is 1 + 1 =2, which matches the first example.

Thus, the code should correctly compute this.

Thus, the code seems correct.
