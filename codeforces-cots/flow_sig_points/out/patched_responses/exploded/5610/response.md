Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem is about a game between Shrek and Donkey with toy soldiers on an n x m grid. Each row can have at most two soldiers. The players take turns moving their soldiers either to attack or retreat. The goal is to determine who wins if both play optimally, considering possible draws.

Hmm. The key here is to model this as a combinatorial game, probably using Grundy numbers (Nimbers) because each row's state contributes to the overall game outcome. Since each row can be considered independently (since moves in different rows don't interfere), we can compute the Grundy number for each row and then XOR them all. If the XOR is non-zero, the first player (Shrek) can win. But if it's zero, then the second player (Donkey) can win. But wait, there's a catch: the players can choose to take moves from any of their soldiers in any rows, but in such a way that the number of soldiers moved in a single move is between 1 and k. Also, the move can be either attack or retreat.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that during a move, a player selects 1 to k soldiers belonging to him and makes them either all attack or all retreat. So each move is a selection of some soldiers (from 1 to k of their own) and then perform attack or retreat with all of them. However, each soldier can only move on their own row. So each move can affect multiple rows, but each selected soldier is in their own row (since each row can have up to two soldiers: one from each player). So each row can have a state that contributes to the game in a certain way.

But how to model this. Let's think of each row as a separate game. Then, the overall game is the XOR of these individual games. However, in each turn, the player can make moves on up to k of these games (since selecting up to k soldiers, each in their own row). Wait, but each move can involve multiple soldiers (from different rows) but the action (attack or retreat) must be the same for all. Oh no, wait: the move is either attack or retreat. So if a player selects multiple soldiers (from different rows), all of them must perform the same action (attack or retreat). So for example, if a player selects two soldiers from two different rows, they can both attack or both retreat.

So this complicates things. Because each move can affect multiple rows (up to k rows), but each of these rows is modified based on the same action (attack or retreat). So this isn't the standard impartial game where each move is in a single pile. Instead, each move can modify multiple piles (rows) in a way that depends on the selected action.

This makes the problem much more complex. Because each move can affect multiple rows, and the same action is applied to all selected soldiers. So the Grundy number approach may not directly apply here.

Hmm. Wait, but the key is that each move is a choice of action (attack or retreat) and a set of up to k soldiers (all belonging to the current player), each in their own row. So each move consists of selecting a subset of rows (each row contributes one soldier) and choosing an action for all. Then, for each such row, the soldier's movement is determined by the action and the current state of the row.

So each row's state is determined by the positions of G and R in that row. For each row, the possible moves (for each player) depend on whether they are attacking or retreating, and how they can move their soldiers.

But since the players can choose any combination of their soldiers (from 1 to k) and apply the same action (attack or retreat) to all, the game is a combination of these possibilities. This seems complicated, but perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that each row's possible contributions to the game can be modeled as a pile, and the selection of up to k piles to take a certain value. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps each row can be considered as a pair of heaps: one for G's possible moves and one for R's possible moves. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each row, we can model the possible options as a game state that can be broken down into options where the current player can take 0 or more stones (like in Nim), but considering that each move can affect up to k rows.

Wait, but in the standard Nim game, each move affects exactly one pile. Here, a move can affect multiple piles (rows) by taking some from each. So perhaps the game is equivalent to a Nim variant where each turn allows you to subtract 1 from up to k piles. Then, the Grundy number for such a game is the XOR of each pile's value, but modulo (k+1) or something like that. Wait, maybe there's a known theory here.

Alternatively, think of each row as contributing a certain value, and when a player makes a move, they can select up to k rows (but possibly fewer) and subtract 1 from each (or whatever the possible moves are). But in our case, the possible moves for each row may not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a variant of Nim where each move consists of selecting between 1 and k piles and subtracting 1 from each. Then, the Grundy number for each pile is its value modulo (k+1). Because for such a game, the optimal play would require that the XOR of all the pile values modulo (k+1) is zero for a losing position.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let's see: for example, if each pile's Grundy number is x_i mod (k+1), then the XOR of all these mod values would determine the outcome. But this depends on the move structure.

Alternatively, maybe each row contributes a certain number of "moves", and when a player can take up to k of these moves in a single turn. Then the game is equivalent to taking from multiple piles, up to k per turn. Hmm.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's try to model the rows first.

For each row, we need to find out how the possible moves for each player (Shrek and Donkey) contribute to the game. Let's look at a single row.

In a row, the soldiers can be in different positions. Let's consider the possible configurations of G and R. Since each row can have at most two soldiers (one G and one R, perhaps), the possible scenarios are:

Case 1: Only G is present in the row. Then, Shrek can move his G soldiers (but according to the attack or retreat rules). Similarly for Donkey if there's only R.

Case 2: Both G and R are present. Then, their positions determine the possible moves. For example, if G is to the left of R, then when Shrek attacks, he moves G towards R, and when he retreats, he moves G away. Similarly for Donkey.

The key is to model each row as a game where the possible moves (for each player) determine the game's outcome. But since this is a two-player impartial game (assuming that the moves available depend only on the current state and player), but in reality, the moves are partisan (different players have different options). Wait, no: Shrek controls the G soldiers, Donkey controls the R soldiers. So the moves available depend on which player's turn it is. So this is a partisan game, which complicates things.

Partisan games are harder to model with standard Grundy numbers. However, the problem says that the game is played optimally by both players. So perhaps we can model each row's state as a pair of values: the Grundy number for the first player (Shrek) and the second player (Donkey). But that might not be tractable.

Alternatively, perhaps each row can be considered as a game where the outcome depends on the parity of some value, or if the row is a losing or winning position for the current player. But given the complexity, perhaps we need to find a way to represent each row's state as a single number that contributes to the overall game's outcome.

Wait, but how? Let's think again. The game is a combination of multiple rows. Each player's move can select any 1 to k soldiers (from their own) and perform an attack or retreat. Each soldier is in a different row (since each row can have at most two soldiers, and per move, you can select any of your soldiers from any rows, up to k).

But each soldier's movement affects only their own row. So when a player selects a set of soldiers (each in their own row) and performs an action (attack or retreat), this is equivalent to making a move in each of the selected rows, but the move is dependent on the action (attack or retreat) and the player's current color (G or R).

So, for each row, depending on the current positions of G and R, the player can perform certain actions. For example, when Shrek (G) chooses to attack, he must move his soldiers towards the enemy (R), if present. Otherwise, he can move in any direction. But during the attack, the movement can't cross other soldiers, etc.

Hmm. Let's model each row's possible moves. Let's take a row and see what options are available to the player when they choose to attack or retreat.

Let's consider a row where there is a G and an R. For example:

G is at position i, R is at position j, where i < j. So the distance between them is j - i - 1 (since there's a gap in between).

In attack mode, Shrek can move his G towards R. He can move it by any number of cells (as long as it's at least 1), but can't cross into R's cell. Also, the movement can't cross any other soldiers (but in this row, there's only R, which is behind). So Shrek's G can move up to (j - i - 1) cells to the right. So the possible moves for attack would be to move G to any position from i+1 to j-1. Similarly, retreat would allow G to move to the left, but only if there are no enemy soldiers in the row (but there is R here, so retreat is moving away from R. Wait, retreat is moving in the direction away from enemy soldiers. So if there's an enemy (R) in the row, then during retreat, G must move away from R. So in this case, since R is to the right of G, retreating would require G to move left. But if G is already at the leftmost position, then he can't retreat. But the problem states that each selected soldier must move at least one cell, so in that case, retreat is not possible.

So for a row with G and R (i < j), Shrek's possible options when choosing attack are to move G to positions i+1 ... j-1. When choosing retreat, he can only move G to positions left of i, but that's only possible if there's space to the left. For example, if G is at position 0, he can't move left, so retreat isn't possible. So in that case, Shrek can't choose to retreat for that G.

Similarly, for Donkey's R in that row. When attacking, R can move left towards G (since G is to the left). But R can't move into G's cell. So the possible attack moves are to move R to positions from j-1 down to i+1. For retreat, R would move to the right (away from G), but only if possible.

So each row's possible moves depend on the positions of G and R (if any) and the action (attack or retreat) chosen.

But how do we model this for the game?

Let's consider each row as a separate game. Then, the overall game's outcome is determined by the combination of these games. However, the players can make moves that affect up to k rows at a time (since they can select up to k soldiers, each in their own row). But the action (attack or retreat) must be the same for all soldiers in the move.

Wait, no. The problem says that during a move, the player selects 1 to k soldiers (all their own) and makes them either all attack or all retreat. So in a single move, the player chooses an action (attack or retreat) and a subset of their soldiers (1 to k), each in different rows. For each such soldier, their movement is determined by the action and the row's current state.

But each row can be considered as an independent subgame. However, each move in the main game can involve making a move in up to k subgames (rows), but all using the same action (attack or retreat). So this complicates things.

For example, suppose a player can choose to attack in 3 rows (if they have soldiers there) by selecting 3 soldiers (each in separate rows) and attack. Each of those rows would then have their state updated according to their own attack rules.

So the key here is that each move consists of choosing an action (A or R) and a set S of soldiers (size between 1 and k) of the current player. For each soldier in S, the player must perform the action (A or R) on their respective row. If any of those soldiers can't perform the action (e.g., retreat is impossible), then the entire move is invalid.

Wait, no. The problem statement says that during a move, the player selects not less than 1 and not more than k soldiers, and makes them either attack or retreat. But all selected soldiers must be able to perform the action. Because if a selected soldier cannot attack or retreat (as per the rules), then that move isn't allowed. So the player can only choose a subset of soldiers where each can perform the chosen action (attack or retreat) in their row.

So for a move to be valid, all selected soldiers must be able to move according to the chosen action. Therefore, when considering possible moves, the player must select a group of soldiers (from 1 to k) such that each can execute the action (attack or retreat) in their respective row.

This complicates the analysis. Because each move is a combination of actions across multiple rows, but each action is only possible if all selected soldiers can perform it.

But given the problem's constraints, perhaps we can model each row's state as a pair of options: whether it's possible for the current player to attack, retreat, or both. Then, for each possible move (attack or retreat), the player can choose any subset of up to k rows where that action is possible.

But even that seems tricky. Let's think differently.

Suppose for each row, the possible options (for the current player) are to attack, retreat, both, or neither. Then, during the player's turn, they can select a subset of their soldiers (up to k) where the action (attack or retreat) is possible in their row, and apply that action to all selected.

Each such selection would lead to a new state of the game. The outcome depends on the possible moves and the Grundy numbers of the resulting states.

But this is a very complex scenario. Given the time constraints (n, m up to 100), and the need to process this efficiently, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to model each row's contribution as a single value that can be XORed or combined in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps each row can be considered as a pile in a variant of Nim, and the allowed moves are to subtract 1 from up to k piles. Then the solution would be similar to the standard Nim game, but modified to account for the k limit. However, this depends on whether the row's possible options can be represented as such piles.

But how to model the row's state as a number of stones in a pile.

Let's think about a row where there's only a G. Then, Shrek can move his G in attack or retreat. But since there's no enemy in the row, attack can move in any direction. Similarly for retreat. Wait, but the problem says: during attack, if there's no enemy in the line, the soldier can move in any direction. So for a row with a single G, Shrek can choose to attack or retreat. But during attack, movement is any direction, and during retreat, since there's no enemy, it's also any direction. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:

An attack is moving all selected soldiers along their lines in the direction of an enemy soldier if there is one. If not, can move any direction. Similarly, retreat is moving away from enemy soldier if present; else any direction.

Wait, but for a row with only G (no R), then during attack, the direction can be any. But during retreat, since there's no enemy, direction can be any. So for a row with only G, both attack and retreat allow moving in any direction. But the movement must be at least one cell, and cannot overlap with other soldiers (but there are none). So in this case, the G can move left or right by any number of cells (as long as within the battlefield and not overlapping others).

Wait, but the row has only G, so the movement would be to any position, but during the move, the soldier can't cross cells where other soldiers stood. But since there are no others, the movement is allowed as long as the destination is empty and within the battlefield.

Wait, no. The problem statement says: during attack, the soldiers are not allowed to cross cells where other soldiers stand (or stood immediately before the attack). Also, can't finish in cells where others stand (or stood).

So if there's only G, then during attack, the G can move left or right. Let's say the G is at position i. During attack, the player can choose to move the G to any position j (j > i) by moving right, or j < i by moving left, as long as the movement is possible (within the battlefield, and no overlapping with others).

But in this case, since there are no other soldiers, the movement is allowed as long as the destination is within the battlefield, and the path (cells passed) are empty. Wait, no. The problem says: during attack, the soldiers are not allowed to cross cells where other soldiers stand (or stood immediately before the attack). So, in a row with only G, when moving, the cells between the original position and the new position must be empty, and the new position must be empty. So the G can move any number of cells to the left or right, provided that all cells in between (including the destination) are empty. But since the row is empty except for G, the movement is allowed to any position, as long as the path is empty and the destination is empty. But since there are no other soldiers, the entire row is empty except for G's original position. So the G can move to any position in the row, as long as it's not the same as before, and the movement is at least one cell. Wait, no: the problem says that each soldier must move at least one cell. So for a single G in a row, during attack, the G can move to any other cell in the row, as long as the path is clear. But since all cells are empty except the starting position, the path is clear. So for example, if the row is "-G--", then G can move left (but it's already at position 1, moving left to position 0 is allowed, but the battlefield is 0-based?), or right to positions 2, 3, etc. So the G can move to any other cell in the row. But how many options are there here? This would result in an infinite number of possible moves, which is impossible for a game. So perhaps we're missing something.

Wait, no. The game is finite. Because once a player moves a soldier to a certain position, future moves can be blocked. But in this case, for a row with a single G, Shrek can move it left or right any number of cells. But since the movement must be done during the move, and each move is a finite step, perhaps each such movement is considered a single option. For example, moving G from position i to i+1 is one option, moving to i+2 is another, etc. Similarly for moving left. But this would mean that the number of possible moves is (m-1) * 2 (since the row has m cells, and G can move to any of m-1 other positions, either left or right). But considering that the battlefield is of finite size (m is up to 100), this is manageable.

But how does this affect the game? If a row with a single G has many possible moves (like moving it left or right by any amount), then the game could have a large state space. However, given the problem constraints, we need a way to model this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps each row's state can be represented by the positions of G and R (if present), and for each such state, we precompute the possible moves and Grundy numbers. But even then, with m up to 100 and n up to 100, this could be computationally expensive.

But perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical model that can represent each row's contribution as a certain value, which can then be combined across all rows to determine the overall outcome.

Let's try to think of each row as a game where the outcome depends on the distance between G and R. For example, if G and R are adjacent, then no moves are possible (since during attack, you can't move into the enemy's cell, and during retreat, you have to move away but there's no space). So, in such a case, the player can't move in that row.

Alternatively, when G and R are not adjacent, the players can move their soldiers in certain ways. Let's consider the distance between G and R as a key parameter.

Suppose in a row, G is at position g and R is at position r, with g < r. The distance between them is d = r - g - 1. So, the space between them is d cells.

When Shrek (G) attacks, he can move his G towards R by any number of cells between 1 and d. For each such movement, the distance decreases by the amount moved. For example, moving G by x cells reduces the distance to d - x.

Similarly, when Shrek retreats (if there's an R present), he must move G away from R. So he can move to the left by any number of cells, but he can't cross other soldiers (but there's no other soldiers except R). So the possible movement is up to g steps to the left (since he can't go beyond the battlefield). For example, if G is at position 2, he can move left to position 1 or 0, assuming those are empty.

Wait, but during retreat, the movement is away from the enemy. So if there's an enemy to the right (R is to the right of G), retreat means moving left. But if there's no enemy (like in a row with only G), retreat allows any direction.

But in the case where there's an enemy (R), during retreat, G must move left. So for each row with G and R, the possible retreat steps for G are the number of cells to the left (positions g-1, g-2, etc., down to 0) that are empty. But in a row with only G and R, the cells to the left of G are empty (since R is to the right). So the number of possible steps for retreat is g positions (since G is at position g, moving left to 0, 1, ..., g-1).

But during retreat, each move must be at least one cell, and the path must be clear. Since the cells to the left of G are empty, G can move left by any number of cells (as long as it's at least 1 and doesn't go beyond the battlefield). So for example, if G is at position 3, he can move left to 2, 1, or 0.

Similarly, for R's retreat when there's a G to the left. But this is getting complicated.

But the key insight might be that each row's state can be represented by a certain value (like the distance between G and R, or the sum of possible moves for each player), and when these values are combined across all rows, the outcome can be determined.

Another angle: the problem is similar to the game of Kayles or Nimbers, but with the ability to affect up to k piles per move. So perhaps the solution involves computing the Grundy number for each row, then taking the XOR of all Grundy numbers. But the move rules are different. Let's suppose that each row's Grundy number is the mex (minimum excludant) of all possible moves available in that row. Then, the XOR of all Grundy numbers would determine the outcome. But this only works if the moves are independent, which may not be the case here since a player's move can affect multiple rows (up to k) per turn.

Wait, but if the game is a variant where a player can select up to k rows and make a move in each of them (like subtracting 1 from each selected row's pile), then the Grundy number would be the XOR of all the individual Grundy numbers modulo (k+1). This is similar to the standard Nim game, but with a limit on the number of piles you can modify per turn. For example, if k is 1, it's standard Nim. If k is 2, then each move can affect up to 2 piles, and so on.

But I'm not sure about the exact theory here. However, according to some sources, when you can take stones from up to k piles, the Grundy number is the XOR of all pile sizes modulo (k+1). So if the XOR mod (k+1) is zero, the position is losing. So perhaps the solution is to compute the XOR of all Grundy numbers for each row and then take modulo (k+1). If the result is non-zero, first player wins; else, second.

But this depends on whether each row's Grundy number is equal to the number of possible moves or something similar. But how to compute the Grundy numbers for each row.

Alternatively, perhaps each row's state can be represented as a single integer (like the distance between G and R), and the Grundy number for that row is the distance. Then, the total XOR is the sum of all distances. But I'm not sure.

Let's try to think of a simple example.

Take the first sample input:

2 3 1
R-G
RG-

The rows are:

Row 1: R-G → R at position 0, G at position 2. Distance is 1 (positions 0 and 2: two cells apart, so d = 2 - 0 -1 =1).

Row 2: RG- → R at 0, G at 1. Distance is 0 (adjacent). So no moves possible in this row.

So for row 1: Shrek can attack (move G towards R). Since d is 1, moving G by 1 cell would bring G to position 1, making the new distance zero. But then, in that row, no further moves are possible. Alternatively, Shrek can retreat (move G away from R), which would require moving left. But G is at position 2, so retreat would be moving left (since R is to the left). But moving left would take G to position 1 (distance 0-1-1= -2? No, maybe this isn't the right way to model.

Wait, maybe the key is to model the possible moves for each player in each row. For a row with both G and R, the players can take certain moves, which affect the distance between them. Let's consider that for such a row, the game is equivalent to a pile of stones equal to the distance. Each attack move reduces the distance (by moving towards the enemy), and each retreat move increases the distance (by moving away). But wait, retreating increases the distance. But how? If G and R are at positions g and r (g < r), and G retreats, he moves left (away from R), which increases the distance between them. For example, if G was at position 2, R at 4 (distance 1), and G moves left to position 0, then the new positions are G at 0, R at 4: distance is 3 (4-0-1=3). So retreating increases the distance. Similarly, attacking reduces the distance.

But in this case, the possible moves for attack are 1 to d steps (d is the current distance). For retreat, the possible moves are 1 to g steps (since G can move left up to g positions). But g is the current position of G. So this complicates the model.

Alternatively, perhaps for each row with both G and R, the possible moves are similar to a pile where the distance is d, and each player can choose to reduce d (attack) or increase it (retreat) by certain amounts. But this seems like a variant of a two-dimensional game, which is not standard.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Let's consider each row independently and determine if it's a winning position for the first player (Shrek), the second player (Donkey), or leads to a draw.

But how?

The problem says that if the game can continue forever, it's a draw. So for a row to contribute to a draw, there must be some cycle in the state transitions. For example, a row where players can move back and forth between states infinitely, never reaching a terminal state.

Alternatively, perhaps the rows are such that the game can't end, leading to a draw.

But how to model this.

Let's think of a row where there's a single G. In such a row, Shrek can always move it left or right (as long as possible). So each move changes the position of G. However, since the battlefield is finite, eventually G will reach a position where no further moves are possible (like the edge of the battlefield). But this depends on the movement rules.

Wait, no. For example, a row of m=3: "-G-". Shrek can attack or retreat. During attack, he can move G to the left or right. If he moves to the left (position 0), then in the next move, he can't retreat (since there's no enemy), so he can attack again, moving right to position 1 or 2. So this can cycle between positions, leading to an infinite game. This would result in a draw.

So rows with a single soldier can contribute to a draw. But how to model this.

If a row has only G, then Shrek can move it any way he wants (since attack and retreat allow any direction). Each move changes the position. However, the game can cycle between positions, leading to a draw. But how to determine this.

Alternatively, if a row has only G, then the game can never end for that row. Because Shrek can always move the G back and forth between positions. For example, move from position 1 to 2 (attack), then in the next move, move back to 1 (retreat), and so on. So the game could loop indefinitely.

In this case, the row contributes a "draw" component. But if there are other rows where players can make moves, the overall game may not be a draw. But if all rows are such that they can cycle indefinitely, then the game is a draw.

But this complicates the analysis. The presence of such rows (with possible infinite play) would affect the overall outcome.

But how can we model this?

The problem requires us to determine whether the first player can force a win, the second player can force a win, or the game can continue forever.

Let's think of each row as contributing to one of three possibilities:

1. The row is a "winning" row for the current player (i.e., the player can take the last move in this row).
2. The row is a "losing" row (the current player has no moves).
3. The row is a "cycle" row (the game can continue indefinitely in this row).

But how to categorize each row.

For example, a row with only G can have infinite moves, so it's a cycle row. A row with G and R adjacent has no moves (so it's a losing row). A row with G and R with distance d >= 1 is a winning row if there's a move that leads to a losing state.

But this is getting too vague. Let's think of the row's possible moves.

Let's consider the row as a state, and model it using Grundy numbers. For each row, compute the Grundy number for each player's turn. But since the players can only move their own soldiers, the Grundy numbers would depend on whether it's Shrek's or Donkey's turn.

But given the time constraints, it's challenging to model this for each row.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into independent games for each row, where each game is a variant of a neutral game (both players can make moves) and the outcome depends on the parity of the number of moves available. But I'm not sure.

An alternative approach is to consider that each row's contribution can be modeled as a value that is 0 if the row is a losing position for the current player, or 1 if it's a winning position, and then XOR all these values. But this is a simplification and may not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps each row's state can be represented by a number, and the XOR of all such numbers will determine the outcome. If the XOR is non-zero, the first player can win. Otherwise, the second. But the presence of rows that can loop indefinitely (like those with a single soldier) would lead to a draw.

So, the steps could be:

1. For each row, compute its state's contribution to the overall game.
2. Sum these contributions (using XOR or another method).
3. If the sum is non-zero, first player wins.
4. If zero, second player wins.
5. However, if there are any rows that allow infinite play (like a single soldier), then the sum is ignored, and the result is a draw.

But this is not necessarily correct. For example, if there are both rows with infinite play and other rows where the sum is non-zero, the first player can choose to make moves in the other rows to win, ignoring the infinite rows. So the presence of infinite rows may not lead to a draw if there are other rows that can be played to a winning state.

Alternatively, the presence of even one row that allows infinite moves would allow the players to loop, leading to a draw. But this is also not correct. Because the first player may have a winning strategy that forces the game to end before any infinite loop can occur.

So, the presence of rows that can contribute to infinite play complicates the analysis. The overall game is a draw only if all rows are of the type that can loop infinitely, or if there's a way for the players to avoid making progress in the other rows and thus loop forever.

But given the complexity of this problem, perhaps the key is to find that the game is a draw if and only if there exists at least one row with a single soldier (either G or R) and no other rows contribute to the game. Or something along those lines.

But how?

Alternatively, let's consider the following:

A row with a single soldier (G or R) allows the player to move it indefinitely. For example, in a row with a G, Shrek can move it back and forth between positions. So as long as there's at least one such row, the game can potentially loop forever. But if there are other rows that can be forced to end the game, then the first player may choose to win by making moves in those rows, ignoring the infinite ones.

However, the problem states that the players play optimally. So if there's a way for the first player to win, they will take it. The draw scenario occurs only when neither player can force a win, and the game can continue indefinitely.

So, the presence of rows with a single soldier (which can loop) can allow for a draw scenario, but only if there are no rows that contribute to a winning strategy for either player.

But this is not clear. For example, if there's a row with a single G and another row with a winning position for Shrek, then Shrek can win by playing in the winning row. The infinite row doesn't affect the outcome.

So, the game is a draw only if all rows are such that:

- There are no rows with a Grundy number contributing to a non-zero XOR (i.e., the sum is zero)
- And there exists at least one row that allows infinite play (like a single soldier)

Otherwise, the outcome depends on the Grundy sum.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row, compute its Grundy number. If the row can contribute to infinite play (like a single soldier), mark it as having an infinite option.
2. Compute the XOR of all Grundy numbers. If it's non-zero, the first player can win.
3. If the XOR is zero, then check if there's any row with infinite play. If yes, it's a draw. Otherwise, the second player wins.

But how to compute the Grundy number for each row.

Let's model each row's state.

Case 1: Row contains only G.

In this case, Shrek can move G in any direction during attack or retreat (since there's no enemy). So each move can be to any position in the row (except the current one). The number of possible moves is (m-1)*2 (moving left or right by varying steps). But each move leaves the row in a state with only G in a new position. Since the next time Shrek's turn comes around, he can move it again, and so on. This leads to an infinite loop. So such a row contributes a Grundy number of 0 (since there's no winning move that leads to a losing state), but also allows infinite play. So for such a row, we can't model it with a finite Grundy number, and instead, it allows the game to loop.

So, for a row with only G or only R, the player can move their soldier back and forth, leading to an infinite game. So these rows contribute to the possibility of a draw.

Case 2: Row contains G and R, with distance d between them.

In this case, each player can attack or retreat, but their options are limited by the presence of the enemy.

For example, if G is to the left of R, Shrek can attack (move G to the right) or retreat (move G to the left). But during attack, the G can move up to d cells (distance d). During retreat, the G can move up to (g) cells to the left (since the current position is g).

But if Shrek chooses to attack, the distance between G and R decreases. If he chooses to retreat, the distance increases.

Similarly for Donkey's R.

In this scenario, each move by a player affects the distance and the possible moves in future.

This seems similar to the game of Kayles or Nim, but with varying options.

But how to model this as a Grundy number.

Perhaps the distance d and the positions of G and R determine the Grundy number.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model each row as follows:

If the row has both G and R, then the possible moves are to reduce the distance (attack) or increase it (retreat) by certain amounts. The Grundy number for this row is the distance d. Then, the overall game's XOR is the sum of all d values.

If the XOR is non-zero, first player wins. Otherwise, second.

But what about rows with a single soldier? Those would have a distance of zero (since there's no enemy), but allow infinite play. So, in such cases, the row's contribution to the XOR is zero, but it allows the game to be a draw.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row, compute the distance d between G and R. If there's only one soldier, mark the row as "infinite" and set d=0.

2. Compute the XOR of all d values.

3. If the XOR is non-zero, first player wins.

4. Else, if there's at least one "infinite" row (with a single soldier), then the game is a draw.

5. Else, second player wins.

But is this correct?

Let's test this with the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

2 3 1
R-G → R at 0, G at 2. Distance is 2-0-1=1.
RG- → R at 0, G at 1. Distance is 1-0-1=0.

XOR of 1 and 0 is 1. Non-zero, so first player wins. Which matches the sample output.

Sample input 2:

3 3 2
G-R → G at 0, R at 2. Distance 2-0-1=1. So d=1.
R-G → R at 0, G at 2. Distance 2-0-1=1. So d=1.
G-R → d=1.

XOR is 1^1^1 = 1. So first player wins. But the sample output is "Second". So this approach must be incorrect.

Hmm. So the approach of using the distance d as the Grundy number is incorrect.

So this suggests that the initial model is flawed.

Another sample input:

Sample input 3:

2 3 1
-R- → only R. So "infinite" row.
-G- → only G. So "infinite" row.

XOR is 0. And there are infinite rows. So output is Draw, which matches the sample.

Sample input 4:

2 5 2
-G-R- → G at 1, R at 3. Distance 3-1-1=1. So d=1.
-R-G- → R at 1, G at 3. Distance 3-1-1=1. So d=1.

XOR is 1^1 = 0. But the sample output is First. So the model is incorrect.

So the approach of using the distance as the Grundy number is not correct.

This means we need a different model.

Alternative approach: the game is a variant of the impartial game where each move consists of selecting up to k piles and making a move in each. For each row, the possible moves are to take away certain options. The key is to find the Grundy number for each row, then compute the XOR of all these numbers. The move of selecting up to k rows and making a move in each (with the same action) would require a different way to combine the Grundy numbers.

But how?

Another thought: since each move can involve up to k rows, the Grundy number of the entire game is the sum of the individual Grundy numbers modulo (k+1). So the total is XOR modulo (k+1). But again, the sample input 4 has k=2. For two rows with Grundy number 1 each, sum is 2. Modulo 3 (k+1=3) is 2. Which is non-zero, so first player wins. Which matches the sample output. But how to determine the Grundy numbers for each row.

So perhaps the correct model is:

Each row's contribution is its Grundy number, and the total is the sum of all Grundy numbers. Then, the outcome is determined by whether the sum is zero or not. But the presence of any row that allows infinite play (single soldier) turns it into a draw.

Wait, but sample input 4's two rows have Grundy numbers of 1 each. Sum is 2. k=2. So according to the modulo (k+1) theory, sum mod 3 is 2. So first player wins. Which matches the sample.

Sample input 2 has three rows with Grundy numbers 1 each. Sum is 3. k=2. mod 3 is 0. So second player wins. Which matches the sample.

Sample input 1: sum 1, mod 2 (k+1=2) is 1. First player wins.

Sample input 3: sum is 0 mod 2 (k=1, mod 2) is 0. But there are infinite rows, so draw.

This seems to fit all samples.

So the model would be:

For each row, compute its Grundy number (which is the distance d between G and R if they are present, or 0 if it's a single soldier). Then, the total is the XOR of all Grundy numbers. But since each move can affect up to k rows, the effective XOR is the total XOR modulo (k+1). If the modulo is non-zero, first player wins. Otherwise, if there are any rows with single soldiers, it's a draw. Otherwise, second player wins.

But how to compute the Grundy number for a row.

But according to the samples, when the distance is 1, the Grundy number is 1. When the distance is 0 (adjacent), the Grundy number is 0.

But what about other distances? For example, if d=2. Let's see.

For a row with G and R at distance 2 (like G--R). Shrek can attack, moving G by 1 or 2 steps. If he moves by 1 step, the new distance is 1. If he moves by 2 steps, the new distance is 0. Both are possible.

But the Grundy number for this row would be mex of the possible next states' Grundy numbers. So for d=2, the possible moves (attack) reduce d to 1 or 0. The possible Grundy numbers are 1 and 0. So mex is 2.

Similarly, if retreat is possible, that would create new states with higher d. But in the case of G and R, the retreat for G (if present) may increase the distance. For example, in a row where G is at position 1 and R is at position 3 (d=1). If G retreats, moving to position 0, new distance is 3-0-1=2. So the new d is 2.

But according to the model, the Grundy number for d=2 would be 2. So the mex of 0, 1 is 2.

But how to model this.

Wait, the problem is that each row's state has not only the distance d but also the positions of G and R. For example, retreating may increase the distance, but attacking decreases it. So the distance can vary up and down, leading to possible cycles.

But the samples suggest that the Grundy number is d (distance), and the total is XOR of all d's modulo (k+1). But according to this model:

Sample input 4's rows have d=1 each. XOR is 0. But according to the model, sum mod (k+1) is 1 + 1 = 2 mod 3 = 2. Which is non-zero. Hence first player wins. Which matches the sample.

Sample input 2's rows have d=1 each. Sum 3 mod 3=0. So second player wins. Which matches.

So this suggests that the model is:

Grundy number for a row with both G and R is the distance d. For rows with a single soldier, it's 0. The total is the XOR of all d's. Then, if this total modulo (k+1) is non-zero, first player wins. Else, check if there are any rows with a single soldier (infinite possible moves), leading to a draw if present. Otherwise, second player wins.

But why does modulo (k+1) work?

According to the theory of Nim with a maximum of k piles played per turn, the Grundy number for the game is the sum modulo (k+1). So perhaps this is the case here.

So the algorithm would be:

For each row:

- If there's no G and no R: contribution 0.
- If there's only G or only R: contribution 0, and mark the row as having a single soldier.
- If there's both G and R: compute the distance d = abs(r_pos - g_pos) - 1. Contribution is d.

Compute the total XOR of all contributions.

Compute total_mod = total_xor % (k + 1).

If total_mod != 0:

- First player wins.

Else:

- If there's any row with a single soldier (G or R), output Draw.
- Else, output Second.

But wait, in sample input 4:

Rows are:

Row 1: G at 1, R at 3. d=3-1-1=1. Contribution 1.

Row 2: R at 1, G at 3. d=3-1-1=1. Contribution 1.

Total_xor = 1 ^ 1 = 0. Then total_mod = 0 % 3 (k=2, so 3) is 0. But the sample output is First. So this model would output Second, which is incorrect.

But the sample input 4's output is First. So there's a contradiction here. Hence, the model is incorrect.

Hmm. So this approach is not correct.

So what's wrong?

Sample input 4:

2 5 2

Rows:

Row 1: -G-R- → G at 1, R at 3. Distance is 3-1-1 = 1.

Row 2: -R-G- → R at 1, G at 3. Distance is 3-1-1 = 1.

Total_xor is 1 XOR 1 = 0.

k=2. So modulo 3 is 0. According to the model, output would be Second. But sample output is First. So the model is wrong.

Thus, the model is not correct. So there must be a different approach.

This indicates that the Grundy numbers are not simply the distance, and the way they are combined is not a simple XOR modulo (k+1). So we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: For each row, the number of possible moves (attack and retreat) determines the Grundy number. For example, if a row allows a player to choose between multiple moves, the mex of those moves' Grundy numbers gives the current row's Grundy number.

But how to compute this for each row.

Let's consider the row with both G and R.

Let's model each row's state as the distance d between G and R. Let's compute the Grundy number for d.

For d=0 (G and R are adjacent):

No moves are possible. So Grundy number is 0.

For d=1:

Shrek can attack, moving G by 1, leading to d=0 (Grundy 0). Or retreat, moving G to the left (if possible). If G's position is 0, retreat isn't possible. But if G can retreat, then the new d increases. But how much?

For example, if G is at position 0 and R is at position 2 (d=1), then retreating (moving left) isn't possible. So the only move is attack, leading to d=0. So the mex of {0} is 1. So the Grundy number is 1.

If G is at position 1 and R at position 3 (d=1), then retreating (moving left) would take G to position 0, increasing the distance to 3-0-1=2. So possible moves after retreat are d=2. So the mex of {0, grundy(2)}.

But what is grundy(2)?

For d=2:

Attack would reduce d by 1 or 2 (if possible). So moves to d=1 or d=0. Their grundy numbers are 1 and 0. Retreat can increase d to 3 (if G moves left from position 1 to 0, then new distance is 3-0-1=2. Wait, no. If G was at position 1, R at 3, then d=1. Retreating G to 0, new distance is 3-0-1=2. So d=2. So grundy(2) is mex of {grundy(1), grundy(0), ...} plus any other moves from retreat.

But this seems complex. It's clear that modeling the grundy numbers for each d requires a recursive approach.

But given time constraints, perhaps we can precompute the grundy numbers for different d values.

Let's try to compute grundy(d) for small d:

d=0: grundy(0) = 0 (no moves).

d=1: possible moves are attack (d becomes 0) and retreat (if possible).

If retreat is possible, then what's the new d. For example, if G is at position 0 and R at 2, then retreating is not possible. So the only move is attack (d=0). So mex of {0} is 1. So grundy(1) = 1.

If G is at position 1 and R at 3 (d=1), retreating (moving left to 0) would new d=3-0-1=2. So the possible moves are attack (d=0) and retreat (d=2). So mex of {0, grundy(2)}.

If grundy(2) is 2, then mex(0, 2) is 1. So grundy(1) would still be 1.

But what is grundy(2)?

For d=2, attack allows moving G by 1 or 2 steps, leading to d=1 or d=0. So possible moves are d=1 and d=0. Their grundy numbers are 1 and 0. So mex is 2. So grundy(2) = 2.

Retreat for d=2: moving G to the left, increasing d by the number of steps moved. For example, if G is at position 1 and R at 4 (d=2), retreating to position 0 would new d=4-0-1=3. So grundy(3) would need to be computed.

But this suggests that the grundy numbers for d are d itself. Because for d=0, 0; d=1, 1; d=2, 2; etc.

But in the case where retreat is possible, this may not hold. Let's see.

For d=2:

Possible moves from attack: d=1 and 0 (grundy 1 and 0). mex is 2.

Possible moves from retreat: depends on whether retreat is possible. If G is at position 1 (R at 4), then retreating to 0 would give d=3. So mex of grundy(3).

If grundy(3) is 3, then the possible moves from retreat would be 3. So mex of {0,1,3} is 2. So grundy(2) remains 2.

But this requires that grundy(d) = d for all d.

Assuming this is the case, then the Grundy number for a row with distance d is d.

Then, the overall XOR is the sum of d's for all rows where both G and R are present.

But how to handle the moves that can affect up to k rows.

If the game is equivalent to Nim with the option to subtract 1 from up to k piles, then the winning condition is the sum modulo (k+1).

So, for each row with d, the contribution is d. The total is the sum of d's.

The effective total is the sum modulo (k+1). If this is non-zero, first player wins.

But sample input 4 has d1 =1, d2=1. sum is 2. k=2. sum mod (3) is 2. So first player wins. Which matches the sample.

Sample input 2 has 3 rows with d=1. sum is 3. mod 3 is 0. So second player wins. Which matches.

Sample input 1 has sum 1. mod 2 is 1. first player wins.

Sample input 4's model now works.

But what about rows with a single soldier.

For such rows, the player can move the soldier infinitely. So this allows the game to be a draw if the sum mod (k+1) is zero.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Compute the sum of d's (distance between G and R) for all rows with both soldiers.

2. Compute sum_mod = sum_d % (k+1).

3. If sum_mod != 0, output First.

4. Else, check if there are any rows with a single soldier (G or R). If yes, output Draw.

5. Else, output Second.

This seems to handle all the sample cases correctly.

Let's verify:

Sample input 4: sum_d=2, k=2. sum_mod=2%3=2 !=0. Output First.

Sample input 2: sum_d=3, k=2. sum_mod=0. No single soldiers. Output Second.

Sample input 1: sum_d=1, k=1. sum_mod=1%2=1. Output First.

Sample input 3: sum_d=0. sum_mod=0. Have single soldiers. Output Draw.

This matches all samples.

Thus, the correct approach is:

- For each row where both G and R are present, compute the distance d between them (d = abs(g_pos - r_pos) - 1).

- Sum all d's and compute sum mod (k+1).

- If the mod is non-zero, First wins.

- Else, if there are any rows with a single soldier (G or R), output Draw.

- Else, Second wins.

Thus, the solution is to:

1. Iterate through each row.

2. For each row, check if it contains both G and R. If so, compute their distance.

3. Sum all distances.

4. Check if the sum modulo (k+1) is non-zero.

5. Also, check if there are any rows with a single soldier.

6. Output according to the rules above.

Now, the code.

First, for each row, we need to find the positions of G and R.

For a row, collect all positions of G and R.

If there's exactly one G or exactly one R, then it's a single-soldier row.

If there are both, compute the distance.

Sum all distances.

Then, compute sum_mod = sum_dist % (k+1).

If sum_mod !=0: First.

Else, if any single-soldier rows: Draw.

Else: Second.

Now, let's code this.

We'll read each row, process it, and track:

- sum_dist: sum of distances for rows with both G and R.

- has_single: boolean indicating if there's any row with exactly one soldier (G or R).

Processing each row:

For a row:

- find positions of G and R.

- if len(G positions) + len(R positions) ==0: no soldiers, nothing.

- elif len(G positions) + len(R positions) ==1: has_single = True.

- else:

   - assume one G and one R.

   - compute their positions.

   - d = abs(g_pos - r_pos) - 1.

   - sum_dist += d.

Then, compute sum_mod = sum_dist % (k+1).

If sum_mod !=0: print First.

Else:

   if has_single: print Draw.

   else: print Second.

But how to find the positions of G and R in a row.

For each row in the input:

- g_pos = None

- r_pos = None

for each character in the row:

   if char == 'G':

       g_pos = current index.

   elif char == 'R':

       r_pos = current index.

Then:

if g_pos is not None and r_pos is not None:

   d = abs(g_pos - r_pos) - 1.

   sum_dist += d.

elif (g_pos is not None and r_pos is None) or (g_pos is None and r_pos is not None):

   has_single = True.

So this code will handle all rows.

Now, test with sample input 4:

Rows are:

Row 1: -G-R- → G at 1, R at 3 → d=3-1-1=1.

Row 2: -R-G- → R at 1, G at 3 → d=3-1-1=1.

sum_dist = 2.

k=2 → k+1=3.

sum_mod=2%3=2 → non-zero. So output First.

Sample input 2:

3 rows with d=1 each. sum_dist=3.

k=2 → sum_mod=0.

No single-soldier rows. So output Second.

Sample input 3:

Both rows have single soldiers. sum_dist=0. sum_mod=0. has_single=True → Draw.

Sample input 1:

Row 1: R and G → d=1. Row 2: R and G → d=0. sum_dist=1+0=1. k=1. sum_mod=1%2=1 → First.

But wait, the second row in sample input 1 is "RG-". So G is at position 1, R at position 0. So d=1-0-1=0. So sum_dist is 1 + 0 = 1. k=1. sum_mod=1%2=1 → First. Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code should handle this.

Now, the code.

Read n, m, k.

sum_dist =0

has_single = False

for each of n rows:

   g_pos = None

   r_pos = None

   for idx, c in enumerate(row):

       if c == 'G':

           g_pos = idx

       elif c == 'R':

           r_pos = idx

   # process the row

   if g_pos is not None and r_pos is not None:

       # both present

       distance = abs(g_pos - r_pos) - 1

       sum_dist += distance

   else:

       # check if exactly one

       if (g_pos is not None) ^ (r_pos is not None):

           has_single = True

sum_mod = sum_dist % (k+1)

if sum_mod !=0:

   print("First")

else:

   if has_single:

       print("Draw")

   else:

       print("Second")

This should handle all cases.

Testing against sample input 2.
