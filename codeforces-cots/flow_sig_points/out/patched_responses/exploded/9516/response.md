Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the optimal order of five students in a line so that their total happiness is maximized based on the interactions they have while waiting for the shower. 

Hmm, the main idea is that as each person leaves the line to take a shower, the remaining people form pairs in the order they stand. Each time, pairs are formed as (2i-1, 2i) for all possible i. For example, if the line is 2,3,1,5,4 initially, before the first person showers, the pairs are 2&3, 1&5. Then after the first leaves, the line is 3,1,5,4. Then the pairs are 3&1,5&4. And so on. Each pair contributes their g values to each other's happiness.

So the goal is to find a permutation of 1-5 (since there are 5 students) that, when processed through this shower queue scenario, maximizes the sum of all g_ij and g_ji for each pair that interacts in each step.

First, I need to model how the pairs are formed at each step. Let's think about the process step by step.

The line starts as a permutation of 5 elements. Then, the first person leaves, leaving 4. The next step, the new first leaves, leaving 3. Then, next leaves, leaving 2. Then next leaves, leaving 1. So the line length decreases by one each time. 

At each step, when there are k people in the line (from k=5 down to 1), the pairs are formed as (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2i-1,2i). For example, when k=5, the pairs are (1,2), (3,4). When k=4, pairs are (1,2), (3,4). When k=3, pairs are (1,2). When k=2, pairs are (1,2). When k=1, no pairs.

So for each permutation of 5 elements, we need to simulate the process where after each person leaves, the remaining line forms pairs as described, and accumulate the sum of g_ij and g_ji for each pair in each step.

The challenge is to compute this sum for all possible permutations (there are 5! = 120 possible permutations) and find the maximum sum.

Since the number of permutations is small (120), a brute-force approach is feasible here. We can iterate through all possible permutations, compute the total happiness for each, and track the maximum.

But how to compute the total happiness for a given permutation?

Let's break it down. For a given permutation (order), we process each step where the line length is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Wait, no. The line starts as 5 elements. Then after the first person leaves, the line is 4 elements. Then after the second leaves, 3, etc., until one remains. But each time, the line is processed for pairs before the person leaves. So for each of these steps (k=5,4,3,2), we form pairs and sum the contributions.

Wait, the line in each step before the next person enters the shower. Let's see:

The process is:

1. The line is in order [p1, p2, p3, p4, p5] (initial permutation).

   - The pairs here are (p1,p2), (p3,p4), (p5 has no pair). So pairs are (0,1), (2,3) indices.

   - Each pair contributes g[a][b] + g[b][a] for each pair a and b.

2. Then, p1 leaves. The line becomes [p2, p3, p4, p5].

   - Now, the line length is 4. Pairs are (p2,p3), (p4,p5). So (0,1), (2,3) indices. Each contributes their g values.

3. Then p2 leaves. The line is [p3, p4, p5].

   - Line length 3. Pairs are (p3,p4). So (0,1) indices. p5 is alone.

4. Then p3 leaves. Line becomes [p4, p5]. Pair is (p4,p5). So (0,1).

5. Then p4 leaves. Only p5 remains. No pairs.

6. Then p5 leaves. The process ends.

Wait, but when each person leaves, the remaining line is processed for pairs. So for each step (before each person leaves), the line is processed for pairs. Let's see:

The initial line is of length 5. We process the pairs. Then the first person leaves. Then, the new line (length 4) is processed for pairs. Then the first person leaves again. And so on until the line is empty.

So for the line [p0, p1, p2, p3, p4], the steps are:

- Before p0 leaves: pairs (0,1), (2,3) (since 5 elements, pairs are 0-1 and 2-3, leaving p4 alone).

- After p0 leaves, the line is [p1, p2, p3, p4].

   Before p1 leaves: pairs (0,1), (2,3) (since length 4, even).

- After p1 leaves, line is [p2, p3, p4].

   Before p2 leaves: pairs (0,1) (since length 3, only first two form a pair).

- After p2 leaves, line is [p3, p4].

   Before p3 leaves: pairs (0,1).

- After p3 leaves, line is [p4].

   Before p4 leaves: no pairs.

So for each step, the line is processed once, and the pairs are formed as per the current line length.

Thus, for a given permutation, the process is as follows:

sum = 0

current_line = permutation.copy()

while len(current_line) > 0:

   # process pairs in current_line

   k = len(current_line)

   for i in 0, 2, 4, ... up to k-1 if even:

      if i+1 < k:

         a = current_line[i]

         b = current_line[i+1]

         sum += g[a-1][b-1] + g[b-1][a-1]

   # remove first person

   current_line.pop(0)

But how many steps are there? For 5 elements, the loop runs 5 times. Wait, the loop runs until the line is empty. So steps for 5 elements:

1. initial line (5 elements) → process pairs, then remove first.

2. line is 4 elements → process, remove first.

3. 3 → process, remove.

4. 2 → process, remove.

5. 1 → process (no pairs), remove.

Wait, the loop runs 5 times. Each time, the current_line is processed for pairs, then the first element is removed.

Yes. So for each permutation, the total happiness is the sum of all the pairs formed in each of the 5 steps (though after the 5th step, the line is empty).

So, for each permutation, we need to compute this sum.

Since the number of permutations is 120, which is manageable, the approach is to generate all permutations of 1-5, compute the sum for each, and find the maximum.

Now, the key steps are:

1. Generate all possible permutations of [1,2,3,4,5].

2. For each permutation, simulate the process of processing the line 5 times (each time with a line of length 5,4,3,2,1, but actually the line starts as 5 elements, then each step reduces the length by 1).

Wait, no. The line in each step after the first is the previous line minus the first element. So the steps are:

Initial line: 5 elements → process pairs, remove first → line becomes 4.

Then process pairs of the 4 elements → remove first → line becomes 3.

Process pairs of 3 elements → remove first → 2.

Process pairs of 2 → remove → 1.

Process pairs of 1 (no pairs) → remove → line is empty.

So the steps for processing the line's pairs are 5 in total. So for each permutation, the simulation is:

sum = 0

line = [p0, p1, p2, p3, p4]

for step in 0 to 4:

   process the line's pairs for step (i.e., current line length)

   sum += the contributions from those pairs

   line = line[1:]

So, the code for a given permutation is:

def compute_total(perm, g):

    total = 0

    current_line = perm.copy()

    for _ in range(5):

        n = len(current_line)

        i = 0

        while i < n:

            if i + 1 < n:

                a = current_line[i]

                b = current_line[i+1]

                total += g[a-1][b-1] + g[b-1][a-1]

            i += 2

        current_line = current_line[1:]

    return total

Wait, but each step, the current_line is processed for pairs, then the first element is removed. So for each of the 5 steps:

In the first iteration, current_line is the initial permutation (5 elements). Then process pairs as (0,1), (2,3). Then line becomes line[1:], which is 4 elements.

Next step: process line (4 elements) → pairs (0,1), (2,3). Then line becomes line[1:] → 3 elements.

Third step: process 3 elements → pairs (0,1). Then line becomes line[1:] → 2 elements.

Fourth step: process 2 → pair (0,1). Then line becomes line[1:] → 1 element.

Fifth step: process 1 → no pairs. Then line becomes line[1:] → empty.

Yes.

So the code correctly simulates the steps.

Now, the problem is to generate all permutations of 1-5, compute each permutation's total, and find the maximum.

But generating all permutations in Python is straightforward using itertools.permutations.

But since the number is small, this is feasible.

So the plan is:

- Read the 5x5 matrix.

- Generate all 5! permutations of [1,2,3,4,5].

- For each permutation, compute the total happiness as per the steps.

- Keep track of the maximum total.

The question is, how efficient this is. For 120 permutations, each with 5 steps (5,4,3,2,1), and each step processing up to 2 pairs (for 5 elements, 2 pairs), 2 pairs for 4 elements, 1 for 3, 1 for 2, 0 for 1. So each permutation has (2+2+1+1) pairs processed. Wait, no:

Wait, in each step, the number of pairs is floor(n/2). So for step 1 (n=5): 2 pairs (indices 0-1 and 2-3). Step 2 (n=4): 2 pairs (0-1, 2-3). Step 3 (n=3): 1 pair (0-1). Step 4 (n=2): 1 pair. Step 5 (n=1): 0. So total pairs per permutation: 2+2+1+1=6. So for each permutation, 6 pairs. 120 *6 = 720 operations. Each involving looking up the g matrix. So this is very manageable.

So the code will run in acceptable time. Python can handle this easily even with the permutations.

So the code outline is:

Read the 5x5 grid into a 2D list.

Generate all permutations of [1,2,3,4,5].

For each permutation:

   compute the total as per the steps.

   compare to the current maximum, update if larger.

Finally, output the maximum.

Now, the code.

Implementing the compute_total function.

But to optimize, perhaps we can precompute the pairs for all possible line positions. But given that it's manageable, perhaps better to just code it directly.

Now, code steps:

Read 5 lines, each with 5 numbers. So g is a list of lists.

Then, generate permutations.

But wait, permutations in Python's itertools.permutations returns tuples. So for each perm in permutations([1,2,3,4,5], 5), which is all 5-element permutations.

For each such perm (tuple), process as per the steps.

In the compute_total function, for each step, the current_line starts as the permutation, then slices after each step.

For example, initial line is perm. Then, line = line[1:], etc.

So here's the code.

But code in Python:

We can read the grid as:

g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(5)]

Then, for each permutation in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]):

Compute the total.

So the code would look like:

import itertools

g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(5)]

max_total = 0

for perm in itertools.permutations([1,2,3,4,5]):

    current_line = list(perm)

    total = 0

    for _ in range(5):

        n = len(current_line)

        i = 0

        while i < n:

            if i+1 < n:

                a = current_line[i]

                b = current_line[i+1]

                total += g[a-1][b-1] + g[b-1][a-1]

            i += 2

        current_line = current_line[1:]

    if total > max_total:

        max_total = total

print(max_total)

Yes. Let's test this code against the sample inputs.

First sample input:

0 0 0 0 9

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0

7 0 0 0 0

So the grid is:

g[0][4] = 9 (person 1 and 5: when they are a pair, 1's happiness increases by 9, 5's by 7).

The sample output is 32, which is achieved by the permutation 2,3,1,5,4.

Let's see how the code would compute this.

Let's take perm = (2,3,1,5,4).

Processing step by step:

Step 1 (current_line is [2,3,1,5,4], n=5):

i=0: a=2, b=3. Add g[1][2] + g[2][1]. g[1][2] is 0 (since all second row is 0). So 0+0=0.

i=2: a=1, b=5. Add g[0][4] (9) + g[4][0] (7) → 16.

i=4: no i+1 (5 is beyond 4). So total now 16.

Then current_line becomes [3,1,5,4].

Step 2 (n=4):

i=0: 3 and 1 → add g[2][0] (0) and g[0][2] (0) → 0.

i=2: 5 and 4 → add g[4][3] (33? Wait the sample input is first line: 0 0 0 0 9. The fifth line is 7 0 0 0 0. So g[4][0] is 7, but other entries for g[4][j] are 0 except j=0. So 5 and 4 are 4 and 5 in the grid. Wait, a=5, b=4. So g[4][3] (since a is 5-1=4, b is 4-1=3). But according to the first sample, the fifth line is 7 0 0 0 0. So g[4][0] is 7, others are 0. So for a=5 and b=4, which is (5-1=4,4-1=3). So g[4][3] is 0. So contribution is 0+0=0. So this adds 0.

Total now 16.

current_line becomes [1,5,4].

Step 3 (n=3):

i=0: 1 and 5. a=1, b=5. g[0][4] (9) + g[4][0] (7) → 16. Add 16 to total → 32.

i=2: beyond n (3). So total becomes 16+16=32.

current_line becomes [5,4].

Step 4 (n=2):

i=0: 5 and 4. a=5, b=4. g[4][3] (0) + g[3][4] (from fourth line, which is 0 0 0 0 0). So 0 +0=0. Total remains 32.

current_line becomes [4].

Step5 (n=1): no pairs. Total remains 32.

So the total is 32, which matches the sample. So the code would find this permutation and return 32.

So the code works for the first sample.

Second sample's output is 620. The code would compute the maximum sum as 620.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, considering optimizations. Since 5! is small, the code is acceptable. However, perhaps using itertools.permutations is efficient enough. Since each permutation is generated as a tuple, converting to a list for current_line is okay.

In Python, the permutations are generated in order, but for the problem, the order of generation does not matter. So the code will work.

So the code is correct.
