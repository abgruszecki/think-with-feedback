Okay, let's see. The problem is about closing certain tabs and finding the maximum possible |e - s| after closing. Hmm. So Roman closes every k-th tab starting from some b. Then, the remaining tabs are all except those that are part of the arithmetic sequence with difference k starting at b.

Wait, the way the example works: when he chooses b=8 and k=3, the closed tabs are 8 -3*3= 8-9= -1? No, wait no. Because the formula is c = b + i*k. So i can be any integer as long as 1 ≤ c ≤n. So in the example, when b=8 and k=3, then i can be 0 (so c=8), then i=-1 gives 5, i=-2 gives 2. i=1 gives 11, i=2 gives 14. So the closed tabs are 2,5,8,11,14. Right.

So the approach is: for each possible b (from 1 to k, perhaps?), determine which tabs are closed, subtract those from the total counts of 1s and -1s. Then compute |e-s| and find the maximum over all possible b.

But wait, how do the possible values of b work? Because when you choose b, the closed tabs are all numbers congruent to b mod k. Because each time you add k, you get the next closed tab. So for any b, the closed tabs are the ones where (c - b) is divisible by k. So the closed tabs are those in the arithmetic sequence starting at b, step k, until you go out of the 1..n range.

But wait, the problem statement says that Roman chooses a tab (b) and then closes all tabs with numbers c = b + i*k that are in 1..n. So for a given b, the closed tabs are all positions in the set {b + i*k | i integer} that are within 1 to n.

But since i can be any integer (positive, negative, zero), the closed positions are all positions congruent to b modulo k. Because adding or subtracting k multiples to reach other positions. Wait, no. Because if k is fixed, then for any c in the closed set, (c - b) must be a multiple of k. So c ≡ b mod k. So all positions that are congruent to b modulo k are closed.

Wait, but the problem statement's example: n=4, k=2. Choosing b=1. Then closed tabs are 1, 3. Because 1 + 0*2=1, 1+1*2=3. Then the closed tabs are positions 1 and 3. Wait, but in the first example input, when k=2 and n=4, the input is 1 1 -1 1. So the closed tabs would be 1 and 3. So the remaining tabs are 2 and 4. The original counts of 1s are 3 (positions 1,2,4) and -1s 1 (position3). After closing, the closed 1s are 1 and3's -1 is removed. So remaining 1s are 2 (positions 2 and4) and -1s are 0. So |2-0|=2, which matches the example.

So for each possible b in 1..k (since modulo k, the residues are 0..k-1?), wait, maybe. Because if you choose a b that's larger than k, like b=k+1, then the residue is (k+1) mod k=1. So the closed positions would be 1 mod k. So the same as choosing b=1. Therefore, for all possible residues from 1 to k, each possible residue corresponds to a unique set of closed tabs. So the possible choices of b are the residues 0 mod k? Wait, no. Wait, the residues modulo k can be from 0 to k-1. But in the problem, the initial b can be any tab (any number from 1 to n). However, different values of b that have the same residue mod k will result in the same set of closed tabs. Because if two different b's have the same residue mod k, then their closed tabs are the same as all positions with that residue mod k.

Therefore, the maximum possible distinct closed sets is k possible residues (0 to k-1), but since k is between 2 and n-1, and n is up to 100, then for each possible residue (mod k), we can compute the closed tabs as all positions congruent to that residue mod k. Wait, wait, no. Because the residue of b mod k is r. So the closed positions are all positions congruent to r mod k. So for each residue r in 0 to k-1, there's a possible closed set. But in the problem, the way b is chosen can't be zero. Because the tabs are numbered from 1 to n. So when you choose b, it's between 1 and n. But the residue mod k can be from 0 to k-1. But for example, if k=2, and b=2, then 2 mod 2 is 0. So the closed tabs are all even numbers (since they are congruent to 0 mod 2). So residues can be from 0 to k-1.

But how many unique residues can there be? Exactly k residues. So for all possible residues r in 0 to k-1, we can compute the closed set as all tabs with numbers congruent to r mod k. Then, for each such r, compute the number of 1s and -1s remaining (original counts minus the sum of the closed tabs in their respective types). Then compute |e - s| and find the maximum over all possible r.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the example shows that for k=3, choosing b=8 (which mod 3 is 8 mod3=2) gives closed tabs 2,5,8,11,14. So the residue is 2 mod3. So for each residue r (0,1,2 in this case), we can compute the closed tabs as all positions congruent to r mod k. So the key insight is that for any possible b, the closed tabs are determined by the residue r = (b mod k). Therefore, there are k possible residues to consider (0 to k-1). However, some residues may not have any tabs in the 1..n range. For example, if k=3 and n=4, then residue 0 would include 3. Residue 1 would include 1,4. Residue 2 would include 2.

But when considering all possible residues, even if some of them do not exist in the 1..n range, the code can still check for each residue, compute the closed positions, and then the counts. But for residues that have no positions in 1..n, then closing those would mean not closing any tabs, which would result in e and s being the original counts minus zero. So the |e - s| would be the same as the original difference. But since the problem requires that Roman must close every k-th tab (i.e., in the example, he must close some tabs), wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that he will close every k-th tab. So he must choose a b such that there's at least one closed tab. But according to the problem statement, k is between 2 and n-1. So for example, if k=2 and n=5, then residues 0 and 1 mod2. Each residue would have at least one tab (since 5 >= k). So the code can consider all residues from 0 to k-1.

Wait, for example, k=2 and n=3. Then residues are 0,1. For residue 0 mod2: tabs 2. For residue 1 mod2: 1,3. So for each residue, there is at least one tab. Because k is at least 2 and n is greater than k. So for all residues in 0..k-1, there exists at least one tab. So the code can loop through all residues from 0 to k-1, compute the closed tabs (all positions ≡ r modk), then compute the remaining e and s, then take the maximum |e - s|.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the initial counts of 1s and -1s. Let total_1 = sum of all 1s in the array. total_neg1 = sum of all -1s (sum of array) - total_1? Or wait, the array is given as a list of 1s and -1s. So total_1 is the count of 1s. s is the count of -1s, so s = total_neg1 = total_1 + sum of array? Wait, sum of array is (1 * count_1) + (-1 * count_neg1) = count_1 - count_neg1. So count_1 - count_neg1 = sum. Also, count_1 + count_neg1 = n. So solving these two equations: sum = count_1 - (n - count_1) => sum = 2count_1 -n => count_1 = (sum +n)/2. Similarly, count_neg1 = (n - sum)/2. But maybe it's easier to just compute count_1 and count_neg1 by iterating through the array.

But given that n is up to 100, it's trivial to loop through the array and count the 1s and -1s.

So first, count_1 = 0, count_neg1 = 0. For each element in the array, if it's 1, add to count_1, else add to count_neg1.

2. For each residue r in 0..k-1:

   a. Find all tabs that are congruent to r modk. So for each tab index (1-based), check if (index - r) %k ==0.

   b. For these closed tabs, compute how many 1s and -1s are there. Let closed_1 be the count of 1s in closed tabs, closed_neg1 the count of -1s.

   c. The remaining e is count_1 - closed_1. The remaining s is count_neg1 - closed_neg1.

   d. Compute |e - s|. Keep track of the maximum.

3. The answer is the maximum of all such |e - s| for all residues r in 0..k-1.

So the algorithm's time complexity is O(nk) which is acceptable for n up to 100 and k up to 99 (since k <n <=100). So even in the worst case, 100*100=10^4 operations, which is very manageable.

Now, the code steps:

Read n and k.

Read the array of n elements (as a list). Convert each to integer.

Compute count_1 and count_neg1.

max_diff = 0.

For r in 0 to k-1:

   closed_1 = 0

   closed_neg1 =0

   for i in 0 to n-1:

       position = i+1 (since the tabs are 1-based)

       if (position - r) %k ==0:

           if array[i] ==1:

               closed_1 +=1

           else:

               closed_neg1 +=1

   e = count_1 - closed_1

   s = count_neg1 - closed_neg1

   current_diff = abs(e - s)

   if current_diff > max_diff:

       max_diff = current_diff

Output max_diff.

Wait, but what if the closed set is empty? But according to the problem statement, k is between 2 and n-1. So for example, if k=2 and n=3, then for residue 0 mod2 (r=0), the closed tabs are 2. Which is allowed. Because Roman must choose a b such that there is at least one tab closed. Wait, the problem says: Roman will close every k-th tab. So in the code, for each residue, even if there are no tabs in that residue, but in the problem constraints, since k is between 2 and n-1, and n >= k+1 (since k <n), then for example, when n=3, k=2. Then residues 0 mod2 (r=0) is 2, and 1 mod2 is 1 and 3. So for any residue r in 0..k-1, there is at least one tab closed. So in code, all residues will have at least one closed tab, so we don't have to worry about cases where no tabs are closed. Because k is at least 2, and n is at least k+1 (since k <n). For example, when n=3 and k=2, residues 0 and 1 both have tabs (2, and 1 and 3). So all residues r in 0..k-1 will have at least one tab closed.

Therefore, the code can proceed as described.

Testing the first example:

Input:
4 2
1 1 -1 1

count_1 is 3 (positions 1,2,4), count_neg1 is 1 (position3).

For r=0 (mod2), the closed positions are 2 and 4 (since (2-0) mod2=0, (4-0) mod2=0). So closed_1=2 (positions 2 and4 are 1s). closed_neg1=0. e=3-2=1, s=1-0=1. |1-1|=0.

For r=1 (mod2), closed positions are 1 and3. closed_1 is 1 (position1) and closed_neg1=1 (position3). e=3-1=2, s=1-1=0. |2-0|=2. So the maximum is 2.

Which matches the first example.

Second example:

Input:
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

The array is:

Indices 1 to14:

1: -1

2:1

3:-1

4:-1

5:1

6:-1

7:-1

8:1

9:-1

10:-1

11:1

12:-1

13:-1

14:1

So count_1: positions 2,5,8,11,14 → 5. count_neg1 is 14-5=9.

For each residue r=0,1,2.

r=0 mod3:

positions are 3,6,9,12 → which are indices 3,6,9,12. Let's check the values:

3: -1

6:-1

9:-1

12:-1 → closed_neg1=4. closed_1=0.

e=5-0=5, s=9-4=5. |5-5|=0.

r=1 mod3:

positions 1,4,7,10,13.

values:

-1, -1, -1, -1, -1 → closed_neg1=5. So e=5, s=9-5=4. |5-4|=1.

r=2 mod3:

positions 2,5,8,11,14.

values:1,1,1,1,1 → closed_1=5. So e=5-5=0, s=9. |0-9|=9. Which is the maximum.

So the code outputs 9, which matches the second example.

Therefore, the approach is correct.

Now, coding this in Python:

Read n and k.

Read the array as list of integers.

count_1 = sum(1 for x in array if x == 1)

count_neg1 = n - count_1

max_diff = 0

for r in range(k):

    closed_1 = 0

    closed_neg1 = 0

    for i in range(n):

        pos = i +1

        if (pos - r) %k ==0:

            if array[i] ==1:

                closed_1 +=1

            else:

                closed_neg1 +=1

    e = count_1 - closed_1

    s = count_neg1 - closed_neg1

    current_diff = abs(e - s)

    if current_diff > max_diff:

        max_diff = current_diff

print(max_diff)

That's the code. It's straightforward. Now, test the first example. For n=4, k=2. r ranges 0,1.

For r=0, closed positions 2 and4 (0-based indices 1 and3). array[1] is 1, array[3] is1. So closed_1=2. e=3-2=1, s=1-0=1. difference 0.

For r=1, closed positions 1 and3 (indices 0 and2). array[0] is1, array[2] is-1. closed_1=1, closed_neg1=1. e=3-1=2, s=1-1=0. diff 2. So output is 2.

Yes.

So the code works.
