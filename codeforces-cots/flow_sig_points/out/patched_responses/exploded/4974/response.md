<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether we can make all puppies the same color using certain operations. The allowed operation is choosing a color x that has at least two puppies, and then recolor all puppies of x to some color y (which can be any color, including existing ones). We can do this multiple times.

Hmm, the key is to figure out the conditions under which it's possible to achieve uniformity.

Let's think about the possible cases.

First, if all puppies are already the same color, then the answer is obviously "Yes".

Otherwise, we need to see if there's a way to perform operations to reach a single color.

What's crucial here? Let's think about the operation. Each operation requires that the color we choose to recolor (x) has at least two puppies. So, for example, if there's a color that occurs exactly once, we can't directly choose it as x. But maybe we can create more of it first?

Wait, no. Because when you recolor x to y, you change all x's to y. So for x to be chosen, it must have at least two instances. But after that, all x's become y, so x's count drops to zero, and y's count increases by the number of x's.

But how can we model this process? Maybe there's a pattern here.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

Case 1: All puppies are the same color. Output Yes.

Case 2: There's exactly one color that has a count of 1, and the rest are in counts ≥2. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

Wait, the operation allows us to merge two or more of the same color into another. So, the strategy might be to merge colors step by step until only one remains.

But how?

For example, in the first sample input: "aabddc" (counts: a:2, b:2, d:2, c:1). Wait, no. Let's check the first example input:

Sample 1: 6 puppies, "aabddc". Let's count the letters:

a:2, b:2, d:2, c:1. Wait, the original string is 6 characters. So maybe the counts are a:2, b:2, d:2, c:1? That sums to 2+2+2+1 =7? Wait, no, that's a mistake. Oh wait, the sample input given in the first example is 6 puppies. Let's recheck:

Wait, the input is 6, and the string is "aabddc". Let's count the letters:

a appears in positions 0,1 → count 2.

b: position 2 → count 1?

Wait no, "aabddc" is a string of length 6. Let's break it down:

Indices 0:a, 1:a, 2:b, 3:d, 4:d, 5:c. So counts: a:2, b:1, d:2, c:1. Wait, but that adds up to 6 (2+1+2+1=6). Oh right, the first sample input is 6, but the explanation says that after some steps, they can turn into all 'c's.

But according to the initial counts here, there are two a's (can be chosen), two d's (can be chosen), but the b and c have counts 1 each. So in the first step, they can choose a, recolor to b. Then the counts would be a:0, b:3 (1+2?), d:2, c:1. Then choose d's (two), recolor to c. Now counts are b:3, c:3. Then choose b (3, which is ≥2), recolor to c. All become c.

So the key is that even if there are colors with count 1 initially, as long as there's a way to merge other colors into them, perhaps through multiple steps.

But how to model this.

Another example: in the second sample, input is 3, "abc". All counts are 1. So no operation can be performed. So answer is No.

So the main idea is that if there's at least one color with count ≥2, then maybe it's possible. Wait, but what if all other colors are 1 except one?

Wait, let's think. Suppose we have a color x that has count ≥2. Then, we can recolor x to some other color y. But after that, y's count increases by the count of x. So if x has count 2, and y's count was 1, then after recoloring, y's count becomes 3. Then, we can recolor y (since 3 ≥2) into another color, etc. So perhaps as long as there's at least one color with count ≥2, and the other colors can be handled through operations, then it's possible.

But wait, what if there's exactly one color with count ≥2, and others are 1.

For example: n=5, string is a a a b c. So counts: a:3, b:1, c:1.

First, recolor a to b. Now counts: b becomes 4 (3+1?), c:1. Then recolor b to c. All become 5 c's. So it's possible.

But what if the initial counts are a:2, and all others (if any) are 1?

In that case, the first operation would be to recolor a to some color (say b). Then, the count of b becomes 2 (since a's count was 2, and adding to b's original 1 would make 3? Wait, no. Wait, when you recolor all a's (2) to b, then a's count becomes 0, and b's count increases by 2. So if original b was 1, then after recoloring a's to b, b's count becomes 1+2=3. Then you can recolor b's (3) to any color (say c). Now c's count is 1 + 3 =4. So all can be merged into one.

Thus, in this case, possible.

So the key condition seems to be: if there's at least one color with count ≥2, then it's possible to perform operations to merge all into one.

Wait, but what if all colors except one have count 1, and the remaining color has count 1 as well? Like the sample input 2: 3 puppies, each a different color. So all counts are 1. Then no operation is possible, so answer is No.

But the presence of at least one color with count ≥2 is necessary.

But is that sufficient? Let's see.

Suppose all colors except one have count ≥2. Wait, no. Suppose the counts are 2,2,2. Then, you can merge them step by step. For example:

Take one color (say a) with count 2, recolor to b. Then b's count becomes 4. Then recolor to c, all become 6.

So possible.

So the necessary and sufficient condition is:

Either all puppies are already the same color, or there exists at least one color with count ≥2, and the total number of colors is such that it can be reduced to one via operations.

Wait, but perhaps the only case when it's impossible is when all colors have count 1 (i.e., each color occurs exactly once), except when n=1 (but n is at least 1). But for n=1, the problem allows zero operations (since you can't choose x with at least two puppies), but the answer is Yes because all are already the same color.

Wait, looking at the problem statement:

In the third example, input is 3 j's. Output is Yes.

Another example: n=1. The input is a single a. Then the answer is Yes.

But if n is 3 and each color is different, like 'abc', then answer is No.

So the conclusion is:

If all puppies are already the same color: Yes.

Else, if there's at least one color that has count ≥2, then Yes.

Wait, wait. Because in that case, even if there are some colors with count 1, you can use the colors with count ≥2 to merge into other colors, then handle the remaining ones.

Wait, for example: suppose you have counts a:2, b:1, c:1.

You can recolor a to b. Now counts are a:0, b:3. Then recolor b to c. All become c's.

So yes.

Another example: counts a:2, b:1. Recolor a to b. Now counts are a:0, b:3. Then possible.

So the condition is: if all counts are 1, then it's impossible. Otherwise, possible.

Wait, but when n is 2 and the two puppies are of different colors, each count is 1, then answer is No.

But if n is 2 and the two puppies are same color, answer is Yes.

So the correct condition is: the answer is Yes if either all are same color, or there exists at least one color with count ≥2 and the number of colors is not such that all are 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is:

The answer is "Yes" if:

Either:

- All puppies are the same color already (so nothing to do).

OR

- There exists at least one color with count ≥2, and the total number of puppies is not all 1 (but that's implied by having a color with count ≥2).

Wait, maybe that's redundant.

Alternatively, the answer is "Yes" if:

The number of puppies is 1 (trivially same color), or there's at least one color with count ≥2, and it's possible to merge all colors into one through the allowed operations.

But how to determine that.

Wait, perhaps the key is that if there's at least one color with count ≥2, then it's possible. Because:

If there's any color x with count ≥2, then you can recolor x to another color y. Then y's count becomes (original count of y) + count_x. Then, if the new count of y is ≥2, you can recolor y to another color, and so on until all are merged.

But how to ensure that this can be done.

Wait, perhaps the existence of at least one color with count ≥2 (and the total number of puppies is ≥2) implies that it's possible. Because:

Let's suppose there's a color x with count m ≥2. Then, for any other color y (with count 1), we can recolor x into y. But wait, when you recolor x to y, all x's become y's. So the new count for y is (original y's count) + m. So if the original y's count was 1, then after recoloring x to y, y's count becomes m+1. Which is ≥2 (since m is ≥2). Then, you can recolor y (now with m+1 ≥3) into any other color z (if there are any remaining), but if there are no other colors, then you have all y's. Wait, but maybe there are multiple colors.

Wait, let's think through this process. Let's say we have colors x (count m ≥2), and other colors y1, y2, ..., yk (each with count 1). So total n = m + k*1.

The steps would be:

1. Recolor x to y1. Now y1's count is m + 1.

2. Now, since y1's count is ≥2, we can recolor y1 to y2. Now y2's count is (m+1) + 1 = m+2.

3. Repeat this process until all colors are merged into one.

So in the end, all can be merged.

But what if after merging x into y1, there's another color y2 with count 1. Then, the next step is to recolor y1 (now count m+1 ≥2) into y2. Then y2's count becomes (m+1) + 1 = m+2, which is ≥3. Then, if there's a y3, we can recolor y2 into y3, and so on. So all the y's can be merged into one.

But in the end, the final color is the last yk. So all will be yk's.

Thus, as long as there is at least one color with count ≥2, the answer is Yes.

But wait, what if the initial counts are x:2, y:1, z:1. So after recoloring x to y, y becomes 3. Then, recolor y to z: z becomes 4. All are z's. So yes.

Another example: initial counts x:2, y:1. Recolor x to y. Now y's count is 3. All are y's.

So in all cases where there's at least one color with count ≥2, answer is Yes. The only case when answer is No is when all colors have count 1. Because then you can't perform any operation. For example, n=3 and s=abc. All counts are 1. So no operation can be done, so answer is No.

So the conclusion is:

If the string is already all same characters → Yes.

Else, if there exists at least one character with count ≥2 → Yes.

Else → No.

Wait, but when n=2 and s is "ab", each count is 1. Then answer is No.

If n=2 and s is "aa" → Yes.

So the condition is correct.

So the approach is:

- Check if all characters are the same → Yes.

- Else, check if any character occurs at least two times → if yes, output Yes, else No.

Because:

In the case where all characters are the same, output is Yes.

Else, if there is at least one character with count ≥2, then answer is Yes.

Else (i.e., all counts are 1, but there are multiple characters, like n ≥2 and each count is 1), answer is No.

So how to implement this.

In code:

Read n and s.

Check if all characters are the same → output Yes.

Else, create a frequency dictionary. Check if any frequency is >=2. If yes → output Yes. Else → No.

But for n=1, the first condition (all same) is true. So it's covered.

Testing the examples:

Sample 1: 6, "aabddc". The counts are a:2, b:1, d:2, c:1. So there are a and d with counts >=2 → Yes.

Sample 2: 3, "abc" → all counts 1 → No.

Sample 3: 3, "jjj" → all same → Yes.

Another test case: n=2, "ab" → counts 1 and 1 → No.

n=2, "aa" → all same → Yes.

n=4, "aabc" → counts a:2, b:1, c:1 → Yes.

So the code can be written as follows:

Read n and s.

if all characters are same:

    print("Yes")

else:

    check if any character has count >=2. If yes → "Yes", else "No".

So in Python:

        counts = {}
        for c in s:
            counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1
            if counts[c] >=2:
                print("Yes", file=output_stream)
                return
        # after checking all characters, if none have count >=2, then all have count 1
        print("No", file=output_stream)

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    if len(set(s)) == 1:
        print("Yes", file=output_stream)
    else:
        # check if any character has count >=2
        counts = {}
        for c in s:

            if counts[c] >=2:
                print("Yes", file=output_stream)
                return
        # after checking all characters, if none have count >=2, then all have count 1
        print("No", file=output_stream)



def test():

    TEST_CASES = [

    ]

        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output

```

Third sample: 3, "jjj". The code's first check (all same) is true, so output Yes.

Another test case: "abbaa" → first 'a' is 1, then 'b' is 1, then 'b' becomes 2 → code exits with Yes.

Thus, the code works.

This approach is O(n) time and O(1) space (since there are at most 26 characters, the counts dictionary will have at most 26 entries, and even if n is 1e5, it's manageable).

So the code is efficient and handles all cases.

```python
n = int(input())

else:
    counts = {}

        counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1
        if counts[c] >= 2:
            print("Yes")
            exit()
    print("No")
```
