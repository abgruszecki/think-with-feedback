Okay, I need to solve this problem where Katie has a code with some asterisks, and I need to replace each asterisk with a lowercase letter to maximize the difference between the number of occurrences of her favorite string s and the not-favorite string t. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of f(c', s) - f(c', t) after replacing all the stars.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The main challenge is that each star can be replaced with any lowercase letter, and we need to choose these letters in a way that maximizes the difference between the counts of s and t in the resulting string. But since s and t can overlap, just naively maximizing s and minimizing t might not be straightforward. We need a way to model all possible choices efficiently.

First, let's think about the possible ways to model the state transitions. For each position in the string c, when replacing a star, we have 26 choices. However, for a string of length up to 1000, trying all possible combinations is impossible (like 26^1000 possibilities). So brute force is out of the question. We need a dynamic programming approach that tracks the state of the current partial matches for both s and t.

Hmm, the key idea here is to use dynamic programming (DP) with states that represent the progress in matching s and t. For each position in the original string, and for each possible state of the automata for s and t (like the current position in the KMP failure function), we track the maximum possible difference (number of s occurrences minus t occurrences) up to that point.

So the DP state will need to keep track of:

- The current index in the string c.
- The current position in the KMP automaton for s (i.e., how much of s we've matched so far).
- The current position in the KMP automaton for t (same for t).

For each step, when processing a character (either fixed or a star that can be replaced with any of 26 letters), we transition the automaton states for both s and t. Whenever a full match of s is completed, we add 1 to the count. Similarly, if a full match of t is completed, we subtract 1. The DP will track the maximum possible difference.

The transitions for the automata can be precomputed using the KMP failure functions (prefix functions) for s and t. This allows us to efficiently compute the next state when a character is added.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Precompute the KMP automaton (failure function and transitions) for s and t. This will allow us to quickly determine, for any current state in the automaton and a new character, what the next state is.

2. Use a DP table that keeps track of the maximum possible difference (s_count - t_count) for each position in c, and each possible pair of states in the s and t automata.

3. Initialize the DP with the starting states (0 for both automata) and a difference of 0.

4. For each character in the input string c, whether it's fixed or a star (which can be replaced by any of 26 letters), iterate over all possible current states and update the DP for the next states based on the possible characters chosen.

5. The answer will be the maximum value in the DP after processing all characters.

Let me think about the details.

First, how to model the KMP automaton for s and t. For each string (s and t), the automaton's state represents the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix. When a new character is added, the automaton transitions to the next state. If the character matches, it increments the state. If not, it uses the failure function to backtrack.

So for each possible current state and input character, the next state can be determined. We need to precompute these transitions for s and t.

For example, for string s, the transitions for each state and character can be stored in a 2D array trans_s where trans_s[i][c] gives the next state when in state i and character c is added.

Similarly for t.

Once these transitions are precomputed, during the DP steps, for each possible state pair (u, v) (current states in s's automaton and t's automaton), and for each possible character that can be placed (if the current character is a star, all 26 letters; else, the fixed character), we compute the next states (u', v') and update the DP accordingly.

Now, the DP state needs to track:

- The current index i in the string c (from 0 to len(c)-1).
- The current state u in s's automaton (ranging from 0 to len(s)).
- The current state v in t's automaton (ranging from 0 to len(t)).

The value stored in DP[i][u][v] is the maximum possible difference (s_count - t_count) achievable up to index i with those states.

The transitions would be as follows:

For each position i in c, for each possible state (u, v) and possible character (if current character is a star, all 26; else, just the fixed character):

- Compute next_u = transition_s[u][char]
- Compute next_v = transition_t[v][char]
- The new s_count_diff is (if next_u == len(s), then 1 else 0)
- The new t_count_diff is (if next_v == len(t), then 1 else 0)
- The total delta is (new_s_count_diff - new_t_count_diff)
- Then, the new DP[i+1][next_u][next_v] would be the maximum between its current value and (current DP[i][u][v] + delta)

But wait, since when we reach the end of s, each occurrence adds 1. Similarly for t. However, each time a full match is found, we need to check how many times it occurs. For example, if s is 'aba', and the string is 'ababa', there are two occurrences overlapping. The KMP automaton would track this correctly.

So the transitions for the automata must handle overlapping matches correctly. This is why using the KMP automaton is essential here.

The initial state for both automata is 0. Then, as each character is processed, we track the states and increment the counts whenever a full match is found.

So the DP needs to track the number of matches of s and t, but storing the actual counts would be too memory-intensive. Instead, we can track the difference (s_count - t_count) directly. Since the DP transitions involve adding the delta (either 0, +1, -1, or combinations?), but for each step, the delta is the sum of any new s matches and any new t matches.

Wait, for each character processed, when we transition to next_u and next_v, if during the processing of that character, a full match of s is completed (i.e., next_u equals the length of s), then the s_count increases by 1. Similarly for t. However, when a full match is found, it's possible that multiple overlaps could trigger multiple counts, but KMP automata are designed to count each occurrence once, even if they overlap. Wait, no. For example, the string 'aaaa' and the pattern 'aaa' would have two occurrences: positions 0-2 and 1-3. The KMP automaton would track the maximum possible. So, in the KMP automaton, when the state reaches the length of the pattern, it increments the count and uses the failure function to backtrack, allowing for overlapping matches.

But in our case, when processing a character, if the transition leads to the full state (len(s)), then that indicates that a new occurrence of s has ended at this position. So each time the automaton reaches the end state, we count +1 for s. Similarly for t.

Therefore, in the DP step, each time we process a character that leads to a transition to len(s) state, we add 1 to the difference (since s's count increases by 1), and if it leads to len(t) state, subtract 1 (since t's count increases by 1).

So the delta for that step is (is_s_completed) ? 1 : 0 minus (is_t_completed) ? 1 : 0.

Therefore, when moving from state u to next_u, and v to next_v:

delta = 0

if next_u == len(s), then delta += 1

if next_v == len(t), then delta -= 1

But wait, for each transition, the delta is determined by whether a new occurrence of s or t is completed. However, in the KMP automaton, when you reach the end state, you have to check how many times that occurs. For example, in the case of overlapping matches, the KMP automaton would allow for multiple counts. So, for each character processed, the transition to next_u could reach len(s), but then the failure function would backtrack. Wait, no. Let's think: when building the KMP automaton, the transitions are such that when a character is processed and the next state is len(s), that's one occurrence of s. Then, the failure function would allow for the possibility of overlapping matches. For example, if the string is 'aaab' and the pattern is 'aaa', then for the input 'aaaa', the occurrences would be at positions 0,1 (overlapping). The KMP automaton would correctly count both.

Wait, the KMP automaton is built in such a way that once you reach the end state (len(s)), you can backtrack using the failure function to find if there's another possible occurrence. Wait, no. The KMP failure function is used to build the automaton transitions. When processing a character, after moving to the next state, if that state is len(s), it means a full match has been found. However, the automaton's transition for that state would be based on the failure function. Hmm, perhaps the way the transitions are built allows for overlapping matches.

Wait, let's take the example of s = 'aaa'. The failure function (prefix function) for s would be [0, 1, 2]. The transition table for state 2 (third 'a') would, upon adding another 'a', transition to state 3 (len(s)), which is a match. Then, the failure function for state 3 is computed as the longest proper suffix which is a prefix of s, but since the length is 3, the failure would be the value of the prefix function for the entire string. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the KMP automaton construction.

Alternatively, perhaps the KMP automaton for pattern s can be built such that each state represents the length of the current match. For each state i (0 <= i <= len(s)), and for each possible character c, the transition is determined by the failure function steps. The transitions can be precomputed so that when in state i and character c is processed, we find the maximum possible j <= i where the j-th state (the j characters) of s can be extended by c.

So, for example, when in state i, and we process a character c. We check if s[i] == c. If yes, then we move to state i+1. If not, we backtrack using the failure function (i = failure[i-1]) and check again until we find a state where s[i] == c or reach state 0. This process is optimized by precomputing the transitions for each state and character.

Thus, the automaton is built so that transitions are precomputed for each state and character. Once that's done, for any current state and character, we can immediately get the next state.

Therefore, when we process a character that causes the state to reach len(s), that's a full match. Then, for overlapping matches, the automaton's transitions would correctly track possible subsequent matches. For example, in the case of 'aaaaa' and 'aaa', processing each 'a' would first reach state 3 (match), and then for the next 'a', the automaton would transition from state 3 (which after backtracking via the failure function) would be state 2 (since the failure of state 3 is 2), then adding 'a' would go to 3 again, leading to another match.

Wait, no. Let's see. Let's build the automaton transitions for s = 'aaa'. The failure function (prefix function) for each position is:

s = 'a', 'a', 'a'

prefix function for s:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 1 (since the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix of 'aa' is 'a' of length 1)

prefix[2] = 2 (longest proper prefix which is also a suffix of 'aaa' is 'aa' of length 2)

So, for state 3 (the full match), the failure function would be the prefix function of the entire string, which is 2. But how is this handled in the automaton transitions?

Wait, the transitions are built for each state from 0 to len(s)-1. For state 3 (the full match), perhaps it's not part of the transition table. Wait, maybe the states are from 0 to len(s), but when in state len(s), we process the next character. How do transitions work then?

Alternatively, perhaps the automaton is built for the pattern, and the states represent the current number of matched characters. For example, state i means that the first i characters of the pattern have been matched. So, for each state i (0 <= i < len(s)), and for each character c, we compute the transition to state j, which is the next state after appending c. For state len(s), perhaps transitions are not considered because once a full match is found, the next state would be determined by the failure function.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the process for building the transitions for the automaton.

The standard KMP approach builds a transition table for each state (current length of the matched prefix) and each possible character. For each state i (from 0 to len(s)), and character c, the next state is computed as follows:

- If c == s[i], then next state is i+1.
- Else, backtrack using the failure function (prefix function) until a state j is found where s[j] == c, then next state is j+1. If j is 0 and s[0] != c, then next state is 0.

Wait, the standard KMP automaton transitions can be built as follows:

For each state i (0 <= i < len(s)), and for each character c:

- If the next character is c, and s[i] == c, then transition to i+1.
- Else, we find the largest possible j (less than i) such that the prefix of length j (s[0..j-1]) is a suffix of s[0..i-1], and s[j] == c. Then, transition to j+1.
- If no such j exists, then transition to 0 if c == s[0], else 0.

Wait, maybe the process is to compute for each state i, and for each character c, the next state. This can be precomputed using the failure function (prefix function) to avoid recomputing each time.

So for each state i and character c:

next_state = 0

if s[i] == c:
    next_state = i+1
else:
    j = failure[i]
    while j > 0 and s[j] != c:
        j = failure[j-1]  # Not sure here, perhaps j = failure[j]
    if s[j] == c:
        next_state = j+1
    else:
        next_state = 0

But this is done for each i < len(s). For state i = len(s), perhaps it's not part of the transition table, but in our problem, since the automaton can reach state len(s) (indicating a full match), we need to handle transitions from state len(s).

Wait, but when you reach state len(s), processing the next character would require transitions. For example, in the 'aaa' example, after matching three 'a's (state 3), the next 'a' would transition to state 3 again. Wait, no. Let's think: the failure function for the full string (state 3) would be 2 (the prefix function for the full string is 2). So, when in state 3 (which is len(s)), and you process a new 'a', what happens?

In the KMP automaton, after a full match (state len(s)), the next transition would be determined by the failure function of the full length. So, the failure for state len(s) is computed as the prefix function for the entire string. For 'aaa', that's 2. So, when in state 3 (full match), and processing a new 'a', the next state would be determined by looking at the failure of 3, which is 2, then checking if s[2] (which is 'a') matches the character. Since it does, the next state is 3 (2+1). So each new 'a' after a full match would keep the state at 3, leading to another match.

Wait, but this would mean that processing a character that brings the state from len(s) to a new state, which could be len(s) again. So, each time the state transitions into len(s), it counts as a new occurrence of s.

Therefore, for our DP, whenever the transition to next_u is len(s), we add 1 to the s count. Similarly for t. So, in the DP transitions, whenever the next state is len(s), that's a new occurrence of s. The same applies to t.

So, for each character processed in the string c, when we transition to a new state u for s and v for t, if u equals len(s), that's an additional occurrence of s (so delta +=1), and if v equals len(t), delta -=1. Then, the delta is added to the current difference.

Thus, the DP state will track the maximum possible difference up to that point for each possible (u, v) state pair.

Now, the DP needs to be initialized with the starting state (u=0, v=0) and a difference of 0. Then, for each character in c, and for each possible (u, v) in the DP, we process the possible characters (depending on whether the current character is a star or fixed) and update the next state's DP value accordingly.

The key challenge here is handling the states efficiently. Since the maximum lengths of s and t are 50 each, the number of possible state pairs is (51) * (51) = 2601. For each of these, and for each position in the string c (up to 1000), the DP table would have 1000 * 51 * 51 = about 2.6 million entries. Since Python can handle this with a 3D array (or using dictionaries for transitions), but given that 1000 * 51 *51 is manageable, the approach is feasible.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute the transition tables for s and t using KMP automata.

2. Initialize a DP table where dp[i][u][v] represents the maximum difference (s_count - t_count) achievable after processing the first i characters of c, ending in state u for s and v for t.

3. For each position i in c, for each possible (u, v) state in the DP, and for each possible character (if the current character is a star, 26 options; else, just the fixed character), compute the next states (u', v') and update dp[i+1][u'][v'] with the maximum value between its current value and (current dp[i][u][v] + delta), where delta is 1 if u' is len(s), minus 1 if v' is len(t).

4. After processing all characters, the maximum value in the final DP states (after processing all characters) is the answer.

Now, implementing the transitions:

First, precompute the transition tables for s and t. For each string, we can create a function that builds a transition table, where for each state (current match length) and character, returns the next state.

So, for a given pattern (like s), the transition function can be built as follows:

- Compute the prefix function (failure function) for the pattern.
- For each state i (from 0 to len(pattern)), and for each character c in 'a' to 'z', compute the next state after processing c.

Wait, but for i from 0 to len(pattern)-1, because the next state after processing a character can be up to len(pattern). For example, if the pattern is 'abc', then state 0 can transition to 1 on 'a', state 1 can transition to 2 on 'b', etc. When in state 3 (len(pattern)), which is the full match, how do transitions work?

Wait, perhaps for the purpose of our problem, the states for s's automaton go up to len(s), and similarly for t. So, for each state up to len(s), we need to compute transitions for all possible characters.

So, to handle the full match case (state len(s)), when building the transition table, we need to compute the transitions for all possible states, including len(s). Because after a full match (state len(s)), processing another character could lead to a new state.

So, for the transition table, the steps would be:

For each state i in 0 ... len(pattern):

   for each character c in 'a' ... 'z':

       if i == len(pattern):

           # After a full match, compute the next state based on the failure function.

           # But how?

           # Let's think: when in state len(pattern), processing a character c.

           # The failure function for the state len(pattern) is the same as the failure function for the entire string.

           # So, the failure for len(pattern) is the prefix function of the entire string.

           # So, the next state is computed by:

           j = failure[len(pattern)-1]

           while True:

               if j < len(pattern) and pattern[j] == c:

                   next_state = j + 1

                   break

               elif j == 0:

                   if pattern[0] == c:

                       next_state = 1

                   else:

                       next_state = 0

                   break

               else:

                   j = failure[j-1]

       else:

           # For states before len(pattern):

           if i < len(pattern) and pattern[i] == c:

               next_state = i + 1

           else:

               j = failure[i-1] if i > 0 else 0

               while j > 0 and pattern[j] != c:

                   j = failure[j-1]

               if pattern[j] == c:

                   next_state = j + 1

               else:

                   if pattern[0] == c:

                       next_state = 1

                   else:

                       next_state = 0

       transition[i][c] = next_state

Wait, perhaps there's a standard way to compute the transition tables for KMP automaton, including after a full match. Alternatively, perhaps when building the transition table, we can handle all states up to len(pattern), and compute transitions for them.

Alternatively, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can model the transitions correctly even for the state len(pattern), which represents a full match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a function that, given a pattern, builds the transition table for all possible states (including len(pattern)), and for all possible characters.

Wait, let's take an example. Let's say the pattern is 'ab'. The failure function for the pattern is [0,0]. The transition table for each state and character would be:

State 0:

a → 1

others → 0

State 1:

b → 2

others → for example, if c is a, then check failure[0] (0), then check if pattern[0] is a. Yes, so transition to 1.

Wait, perhaps the way to compute transitions is as follows. For state i and character c:

If i is the length of the pattern (full match), then the next state is determined by processing the character c, starting from the failure function of the entire pattern.

For example, the failure function of the entire pattern is the value of the prefix function for the entire string. For 'ab', the prefix function for the entire string (len 2) is 0.

So, when in state 2 (len(ab)), processing c:

We start with j = failure[len(pattern) -1] = failure[1] = 0.

Then, check if pattern[j] (pattern[0] is 'a') equals c. If yes, next state is j+1 = 1.

If not, then check the failure function again. Since j is 0, if pattern[0] != c, then next state is 0.

So for state 2 (len(ab)) and c = 'a', next state is 1. For c = 'b', next state is 0.

Wait, but perhaps the transitions for the state len(pattern) (i=2) are built using the same logic as for the other states.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions for the state len(pattern) can be built by using the failure function of the entire pattern. So, for each state i (including len(pattern)), the transition for character c is computed by the same process: start with j = failure[i-1], then look for the longest possible prefix that allows a transition.

But perhaps the code for building the transitions for all states can be written in a uniform way.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let's think of code to compute the transition table for a given pattern.

An alternative approach is to compute the failure function (prefix function) for the pattern, and then for each state i (from 0 to len(pattern)), and each possible character c, compute the next state as follows:

def build_transitions(pattern):
    n = len(pattern)
    fail = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = fail[i-1]
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = fail[j-1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        fail[i] = j

    transitions = [[0]*26 for _ in range(n+1)]
    for state in range(n+1):
        for c in range(26):
            char = chr(ord('a') + c)
            if state < n and pattern[state] == char:
                transitions[state][c] = state + 1
            else:
                # Backtrack using the failure function
                # But state can be n (len(pattern)), which is the state after full match
                # Need to compute j for state-1? Or for state?
                # Wait, when state is n, the failure is fail[state-1] (since the original fail array is for the pattern)
                # For example, in the 'aaa' case, state 3 (n=3), the failure is fail[2] = 2.
                j = state
                while True:
                    if j == 0:
                        # No more backtracking possible
                        if pattern[0] == char:
                            transitions[state][c] = 1
                        else:
                            transitions[state][c] = 0
                        break
                    j = fail[j-1] if j-1 < n else fail[n-1]  # Wait, not sure here.
                    if j < n and pattern[j] == char:
                        transitions[state][c] = j + 1
                        break
    return transitions

Wait, maybe this code isn't correct, but let's think. For state i (ranging from 0 to len(pattern)), and for each character c:

- If i < len(pattern), and the character matches pattern[i], then next state is i+1.

- Otherwise, we backtrack using the failure function until we find a state j where pattern[j] == c, and then next state is j+1. If no such j, then 0.

But when i is len(pattern), which is the state after a full match, the failure function to backtrack would be the failure function of the entire pattern. For example, for 'aaa', the failure function for the last character (index 2) is 2. So for state 3 (len(pattern)), the backtracking would start with j = state -1 = 2 (but len(pattern) is 3), so j = 2. Then, the failure function of j-1 is 2-1=1, but that's for the pattern up to index 1. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust how the backtracking is done for state len(pattern).

Alternatively, when in state i (which could be len(pattern)), the backtracking process should start with the failure function of the entire pattern. For example, for state i = len(pattern), the failure is the same as the failure of the last character in the pattern (since the failure array is built for the pattern up to each position). Then, the backtracking proceeds as usual.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the code can be written to handle all states, including state len(pattern).

Alternatively, perhaps the code for the transition table can be written as follows:

def build_transitions(pattern):
    n = len(pattern)
    # Compute the failure function (prefix function) for the pattern
    fail = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = fail[i-1]
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = fail[j-1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        fail[i] = j

    # Create transitions for each state (0 to n) and each character
    transitions = []
    for state in range(n + 1):
        transitions_for_state = [0] * 26
        for c in range(26):
            char = chr(ord('a') + c)
            current = state
            while True:
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    transitions_for_state[c] = current + 1
                    break
                if current == 0:
                    transitions_for_state[c] = 0
                    break
                current = fail[current-1]
        transitions.append(transitions_for_state)
    return transitions

Wait, this code builds transitions for states 0 to n (inclusive). For each state and character, it uses the failure function to backtrack until it finds a position where the character matches. But for state n (len(pattern)), which is beyond the length of the pattern, how is current handled?

Let's see. For state n:

current = state (n). Then, in the loop:

if current < n and pattern[current] == char:

But current is n, which is >= len(pattern) (since n is len(pattern)), so this condition is false.

So then, check if current ==0: no, current is n.

So then, current = fail[current-1]. But current is n, so current-1 is n-1. The fail array is only of length n. So for i in 0..n-1. So fail[current-1] is fail[n-1], which is the failure for the last character of the pattern.

So this code handles state n by using the failure function of the last character. Then, backtracking as usual.

So for example, if the pattern is 'aaa', state 3 (n=3). For a character 'a', current starts at 3. Since current is >=n, it goes to current = fail[2] (which is 2). Then, check again: current is 2 <3, and pattern[2] is 'a' == 'a', so transitions_for_state['a'] is 3.

For the next 'a', again, current is 3, and the same process leads to 3 again.

This code seems to handle state n correctly.

So, in this way, the transitions for state len(pattern) are computed by backtracking using the failure function of the last character of the pattern, which allows overlapping matches to be counted.

Therefore, the code for building the transitions seems correct.

Once the transitions are built for both s and t, the next step is to implement the DP.

The DP can be represented as a 2D array (since we process the string character by character, and for each step, we only need the current and next state). To save memory, we can use two 2D arrays: one for the current step (i) and one for the next step (i+1).

But in Python, with the given constraints (s and t up to 50 in length), the maximum state pairs are 51 * 51 = 2601. For each step (up to 1000), we can manage a 3D array, but using two layers (current and next) is more efficient.

So, the steps are:

Initialize a DP array (current_dp) which is a 2D array of size (len(s)+1) x (len(t)+1). The values are the maximum possible difference for each state pair (u, v). Initially, for the starting state (u=0, v=0), the difference is 0, and all others are -infinity.

For each character in the input string c:

   Create a new next_dp array initialized to -infinity.

   For each possible state pair (u, v) in current_dp where current_dp[u][v] is not -infinity:

       Determine the possible characters to process. If the current character is '*', then iterate over all 26 letters. Else, only the fixed character.

       For each possible character in this set:

           Compute the next_u by looking up transitions_s[u][char_index]

           Compute the next_v by looking up transitions_t[v][char_index]

           Compute delta:

               delta = 0

               if next_u == len(s): delta += 1

               if next_v == len(t): delta -= 1

           new_value = current_dp[u][v] + delta

           if new_value > next_dp[next_u][next_v]:

               next_dp[next_u][next_v] = new_value

   Set current_dp to next_dp for the next iteration.

After processing all characters, the maximum value in current_dp is the answer.

But wait, how do we handle the transitions? For example, transitions_s is a list where transitions_s[u][c] gives the next state for the s automaton when in state u and the character is 'a' + c. Similarly for transitions_t.

So, in code:

For each character in c:

   if char is '*', loop over all 26 possible c in 'a' to 'z'

   else, loop over only the fixed character

   for each possible character (ch) in this set:

       c_code = ord(ch) - ord('a')

       for each (u, v) in current_dp where current_dp[u][v] is not -infinity:

           next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

           next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

           delta = 0

           if next_u == len_s:

               delta +=1

           if next_v == len_t:

               delta -=1

           new_value = current_dp[u][v] + delta

           if next_dp[next_u][next_v] < new_value:

               next_dp[next_u][next_v] = new_value

So, in Python, the code can be structured as follows:

First, build the transitions for s and t.

Then, initialize the DP. Since the initial state is (0, 0) with a difference of 0, we can use a dictionary or a 2D array.

But for efficiency, using a list of lists for current_dp and next_dp would be better.

So, len_s = len(s), len_t = len(t)

Initialize current_dp as a (len_s +1) x (len_t +1) array filled with -infinity, except current_dp[0][0] = 0.

Then, for each character in the input string:

   For each possible (u, v) in current_dp where current_dp[u][v] is not -infinity:

       Determine the possible characters to try.

       For each such character:

           c_code = ord(ch) - ord('a')

           next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

           next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

           delta = (1 if next_u == len_s else 0) - (1 if next_v == len_t else 0)

           if next_dp[next_u][next_v] < current_dp[u][v] + delta:

               next_dp[next_u][next_v] = current_dp[u][v] + delta

At each step, after processing all possible transitions for a character, the current_dp is replaced with next_dp, which is initialized to -infinity for all (u, v) at the start of each step.

Now, the problem is to handle the current_dp and next_dp efficiently.

But given that len_s and len_t are up to 50, the 2D arrays are manageable.

Now, let's consider the time complexity. For each character in c (up to 1000), for each possible (u, v) pair (51*51=2601), and for each possible character (1 or 26), the transitions are computed. So for the worst case where all characters are stars, it's 1000 * 2601 * 26 = 67,626,000 operations. Python can handle that within 2 seconds, I think.

Now, handling the transitions correctly is crucial. So let's code the build_transitions function as described earlier.

Testing with the examples:

First example:

Input:

*****

katie

shiro

s is 'katie' (len 5), t is 'shiro' (len 5).

The transitions for s and t are built, and the DP proceeds.

The optimal replacement is to replace the stars with 'katie', leading to one occurrence of s and 0 of t.

So, the DP should compute this.

Another example:

Input: caat

caat

a

The only possible c' is 'caat'. The occurrences of s (caat) is 1, and occurrences of t (a) are 3. So the difference is -2. Wait, but the sample output is -1. Wait, the sample says output is -1. Wait, let's check the second example:

Sample input 2:

caat

caat

a

The output is -1. Wait, the string is 'caat'. The s is 'caat', so there's 1 occurrence. The t is 'a', which occurs at positions 1, 2. So two occurrences. 1-2 = -1. Which matches the output. So the code must count overlapping occurrences.

In this example, the code for the DP should correctly count the occurrences of 'a' as 2, leading to 1-2 = -1.

So the code must handle overlapping occurrences correctly.

Now, let's code the build_transitions function.

But first, perhaps the code for the transitions is as follows:

def build_transitions(pattern):
    n = len(pattern)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    # Compute failure function
    fail = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = fail[i-1]
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = fail[j-1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        fail[i] = j

    # Build transitions for each state (0 to n)
    transitions = []
    for state in range(n + 1):
        trans = []
        for c in range(26):
            char = chr(ord('a') + c)
            current = state
            while True:
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    next_state = current + 1
                    break
                if current == 0:
                    next_state = 0
                    break
                current = fail[current-1]
            # After possible break, check if the next_state is correct
            # Wait, after breaking from the loop, we have next_state?
            # No, need to recompute.

            # Wait, the loop is to find the next_state:

            next_state = 0
            current = state
            while True:
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    next_state = current + 1
                    break
                if current == 0:
                    if pattern[0] == char:
                        next_state = 1
                    else:
                        next_state = 0
                    break
                current = fail[current-1]
            trans.append(next_state)
        transitions.append(trans)
    return transitions

Wait, perhaps the code needs to be corrected. Let's think: for a given state and character, how do we compute the next state.

Alternative approach: for a given state and character, the next state is determined by:

Start with current = state.

Loop:

- If current < len(pattern) and pattern[current] == char, next state is current+1.

- Else, if current is 0, next state is 0 if pattern[0] != char, else 1.

- Else, current = failure[current-1], and repeat.

So the code for the transition is:

def build_transitions(pattern):
    n = len(pattern)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    # Compute failure function
    fail = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = fail[i-1]
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = fail[j-1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        fail[i] = j

    # Build transitions for each state (0 to n)
    transitions = []
    for state in range(n + 1):
        trans = []
        for c in range(26):
            char = chr(ord('a') + c)
            current = state
            while True:
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    next_state = current + 1
                    break
                # current >=n or pattern[current] != char
                if current == 0:
                    # can't backtrack further
                    next_state = 0
                    if pattern[0] == char:
                        next_state = 1
                    break
                current = fail[current-1]
                # Now check again
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    next_state = current + 1
                    break
                # else, loop again
            trans.append(next_state)
        transitions.append(trans)
    return transitions

But I'm not confident. Let's test this with a simple example.

Test case 1: pattern 'a', transitions for state 0 and character 'a' should be 1. For state 1 (n=1), which is the full match. For character 'a', transitions from state 1:

current = 1 (state is 1).

current < n (1 is not < 1). So, enter the loop.

current is not 0, so current = fail[current-1] = fail[0] = 0.

Now, check again: current=0 < n and pattern[0] is 'a'. So next_state=0+1=1.

Thus, transitions for state 1 and 'a' would be 1. So processing 'a's after the first 'a' would keep transitioning to 1, counting a new occurrence each time.

Yes, this works.

Another test case: pattern 'ab'.

State 0, character 'a' → next_state 1.

State 0, character 'b' → next_state 0.

State 1, character 'b' → next_state 2 (len(ab)).

State 1, character 'a' → current is 1, which is not < 2. So backtrack to fail[0] = 0. Check if pattern[0] == 'a', yes. next_state is 1.

So for state 1, character 'a' transitions to 1.

State 2 (len(ab)), character 'a':

current is 2. current >=n (2 >=2). So, current = fail[1] (fail for state 1 is 0). Now current is 0.

Check pattern[0] == 'a' → yes. next_state = 0+1=1.

So transitions for state 2 and 'a' is 1.

This seems correct.

So the code for building the transitions is correct.

Once the transitions are built, the DP can proceed.

Now, coding the entire solution.

Let's outline the steps:

Read input:

c = input().strip()

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

Build transitions for s and t.

Build transitions_s = build_transitions(s)

Build transitions_t = build_transitions(t)

Initialize DP:

current_dp is a 2D array of (len(s)+1) x (len(t)+1), filled with -infinity, except current_dp[0][0] = 0.

For each char in c:

   create next_dp filled with -infinity.

   for each (u, v) in current_dp where current_dp[u][v] is not -infinity:

       if current character is '*':

           for all 26 letters:

               c_code = ord(ch) - ord('a')

               next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

               next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

               delta = (1 if next_u == len(s) else 0) - (1 if next_v == len(t) else 0)

               new_val = current_dp[u][v] + delta

               if new_val > next_dp[next_u][next_v]:

                   next_dp[next_u][next_v] = new_val

       else:

           ch = current character

           c_code = ord(ch) - ord('a')

           next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

           next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

           delta = (1 if next_u == len(s) else 0) - (1 if next_v == len(t) else 0)

           new_val = current_dp[u][v] + delta

           if new_val > next_dp[next_u][next_v]:

               next_dp[next_u][next_v] = new_val

   current_dp = next_dp

After processing all characters, the maximum value in current_dp is the answer.

Now, implement this in Python.

But how to represent the DP tables? Using lists of lists.

For example:

len_s = len(s)

len_t = len(t)

current_dp is a list of len_s+1 lists, each of len_t+1 elements, initialized to -infinity.

Initially:

current_dp = [[-inf] * (len_t + 1) for _ in range(len_s + 1)]

current_dp[0][0] = 0

Then, for each character in c:

   next_dp = [[-inf] * (len_t + 1) for _ in range(len_s + 1)]

   for u in range(len_s + 1):

       for v in range(len_t + 1):

           if current_dp[u][v] == -inf:

               continue

           # process possible characters

           if c_char == '*':

               for c_code in range(26):

                   ch = chr(ord('a') + c_code)

                   next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

                   next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

                   delta = 0

                   if next_u == len_s:

                       delta += 1

                   if next_v == len_t:

                       delta -= 1

                   if next_dp[next_u][next_v] < current_dp[u][v] + delta:

                       next_dp[next_u][next_v] = current_dp[u][v] + delta

           else:

               c_code = ord(c_char) - ord('a')

               next_u = transitions_s[u][c_code]

               next_v = transitions_t[v][c_code]

               delta = 0

               if next_u == len_s:

                   delta += 1

               if next_v == len_t:

                   delta -= 1

               if next_dp[next_u][next_v] < current_dp[u][v] + delta:

                   next_dp[next_u][next_v] = current_dp[u][v] + delta

   current_dp = next_dp

Finally, find the maximum value in current_dp.

But how to loop through all possible u and v in Python.

Now, the code:

Implementing this.

But in Python, the transitions_s and transitions_t are lists where transitions_s[u][c_code] gives the next state.

Now, testing with the first example:

Input:

*****

katie

shiro

s is 'katie' (length 5), t is 'shiro' (length 5).

The code builds transitions for s and t.

The transitions for s would have states 0 to 5.

When processing each of the 5 '*'s, the code tries all 26 letters, but the optimal choice is to replace each '*' with the corresponding character of 'katie' to form the string 'katie'. This gives one occurrence of s and 0 of t.

The code should find that the maximum difference is 1.

Another test case: the fourth example.

Input:

***

cc

z

The code should replace all stars with 'c's, forming 'ccc'. Then, the occurrences of s (cc) are 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2), and t (z) has 0. So 2-0=2.

The code should output 2.

Now, implementing the code.

Potential issues:

- Handling the transitions for state 0 to len(s) and len(t) correctly.

- Initializing the current_dp correctly.

- Efficiency: using lists of lists and pre-allocating the next_dp each step.

Now, the code:

Here's the complete code:

Read the inputs, build transitions, initialize DP, process each character, update DP, and find the maximum.

Now, the code in Python:

But in Python, initializing the DP with -infinity can be done using a list comprehension with float('-inf').

But since Python's list comprehensions can't directly assign values, we need to create the 2D arrays correctly.

Here's the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def build_transitions(pattern):
    n = len(pattern)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    # Compute failure function
    fail = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = fail[i-1]
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = fail[j-1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        fail[i] = j

    # Build transitions for each state (0 to n)
    transitions = []
    for state in range(n + 1):
        trans = []
        for c in range(26):
            char = chr(ord('a') + c)
            current = state
            next_state = 0
            while True:
                if current < n and pattern[current] == char:
                    next_state = current + 1
                    break
                if current == 0:
                    if pattern[0] == char:
                        next_state = 1
                    else:
                        next_state = 0
                    break
                current = fail[current-1]
            trans.append(next_state)
        transitions.append(trans)
    return transitions

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    c = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    t = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    len_s = len(s)

    transitions_t = build_transitions(t)
