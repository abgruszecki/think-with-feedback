Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the number of distinct decompositions of m into n ordered positive integers, where m is the product of the given a1 to an. And we need to output the count modulo 1e9+7. 

Hmm. Let's start by understanding the problem. The input gives us n numbers, and their product is m. We need to count all possible ordered tuples (b1, b2, ..., bn) such that the product of all bi equals m. And each decomposition is considered different if any position differs.

First, the key here is to factorize m into its prime factors and then compute the number of ways to distribute each prime's exponents across the n factors. Because the order matters (since the tuple is ordered), each prime's exponents can be handled independently once we factorize m.

Wait, right. Because the primes are multiplicative. So for example, if m = p^a * q^b, then the total decompositions would be the product of the number of ways to distribute a exponents of p into the n factors multiplied by the number of ways to distribute b exponents of q into the n factors.

So the plan is:

1. Factorize the product of all a_i into primes.
2. For each prime's exponent, compute the number of ways to split that exponent into n non-negative integers (since each bi can have zero exponents for a prime, as long as their product is the total exponent). The sum of exponents for each prime across all bi must equal the exponent in m.
3. Multiply all these numbers for each prime together, modulo 1e9+7.

But wait, how do we compute the number of ways to split a prime's exponent into n terms? That's a classic stars and bars problem. For a prime p with exponent k, the number of ways is combination(k + n - 1, n - 1). Because each of the n factors can take some of the exponents, and the sum is k. So for each prime, it's C(k + n-1, n-1), and the total is the product of all these values.

So the steps are:

- Compute the product of all a_i, but actually factorizing each a_i and then combining all the exponents. Because directly multiplying a_i's (which can be up to 1e9 each) would lead to a very large m that's impossible to factorize quickly. So we need to factorize each a_i individually and then aggregate the exponents.

Yes. So first, factorize each a_i into primes, then sum all the exponents for each prime across all a_i. That gives us the exponents of each prime in m.

Once we have the exponents for each prime, for each exponent k, compute C(k + n-1, n-1), then multiply all those combinations together modulo 1e9+7.

So the main challenges here are:

1. Efficiently factorizing each a_i. Since a_i can be up to 1e9, but for n up to 500, we need to factorize 500 numbers each up to 1e9. So for each a_i, we can do trial division up to sqrt(a_i). Alternatively, use Pollard's algorithm for factorization, but trial division might be sufficient here given that 1e9's square root is 3e4, which is manageable for 500 numbers.

Wait, trial division for a_i up to 1e9. The square root is 31622. For each a_i, trial division up to sqrt(a_i) would take O(sqrt(a_i)) time. For 500 numbers, each up to 1e9, that's acceptable? Let's see: 500 * 3e4 = 1.5e7 operations. That's manageable in Python, but maybe tight. But perhaps we can optimize by checking primes up to sqrt(a_i), but even trial division should be okay.

But we can also note that for a_i=1, we can skip. So first, we need to process each a_i, factorize into primes, accumulate the exponents.

Once all primes are collected, for each prime's total exponent k, compute the combination C(k + n-1, n-1).

But how to compute combinations here, especially since n can be up to 500 and k can be up to (sum of exponents across all a_i). For example, each a_i is 1e9, so each can contribute up to exponents. So the total exponent for a prime could be up to 500 * log2(1e9) (since 1e9 is 2^30, so 30*500=15,000). So k could be up to, say, 5e5 or even higher. But the combination C(k + n-1, n-1) needs to be computed modulo 1e9+7.

So the problem is to compute combinations where the numerator can be up to (5e5 + 500) choose (500), but n can be up to 500, and the modulus is 1e9+7.

But how can we compute C(k + n-1, n-1) for varying k? Let's see. For each prime, we need to calculate this value.

The standard way to compute combinations modulo a prime (since 1e9+7 is a prime) is to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to the maximum possible value of k + n-1. But since k can be up to 5e4 or even more, but if the maximum possible k is 500 * 30 (if all a_i are 2^30), that's 15,000. So for n up to 500, the maximum (k +n-1) is 15,000 + 499 = 15,499. So precomputing factorial up to 15,500 would be feasible.

Wait, but each a_i could be a prime number up to 1e9. For example, if each a_i is a prime, then the exponent for each prime would be 1 per a_i. But if all a_i are the same prime, then the total exponent is n. For example, if all a_i are 2, then the total exponent for 2 is n. So for n up to 500, the exponent can be up to 500. So for primes that appear once in each a_i, the exponent is n. But if a_i's have higher exponents, for example, if an a_i is 2^100, then the exponent for 2 increases by 100.

Wait, but the maximum possible exponent for a prime is when all a_i are the same prime, each with as high an exponent as possible. For example, each a_i is 2^30 (since 1e9 is about 2^30), so each a_i contributes 30 exponents. So the total exponent would be 30*500=15,000.

So the maximum (k + n-1) would be 15,000 + 500-1 = 15,499. So precomputing factorials up to 15,500 is manageable.

But wait, n can be up to 500. So for each combination C(k + n-1, n-1) = (k +n-1 choose n-1). For example, for n=500, and k=15000, then (15000 +499) choose 499. So the maximum needed is 15499 choose 499. But the problem is that when k varies, we can precompute factorials up to 15499 and then compute combinations as fact[k +n-1] * inv_fact[n-1] * inv_fact[k] mod MOD.

Wait, but the combination formula is C(a, b) = fact[a]/( fact[b] * fact[a-b] ). So for C(k +n-1, n-1), a = k +n-1, b =n-1, so it's fact[a] * inv_fact[b] * inv_fact[a -b] mod MOD. Here, a -b = (k +n-1) - (n-1) =k. So the formula is fact[a] * inv_fact[n-1] * inv_fact[k] mod MOD.

So precomputing fact up to maximum a (like 15,500), inv_fact up to same, then for each k, compute the product of fact[k +n-1] * inv_fact[n-1] * inv_fact[k] mod MOD.

But wait, the maximum a is k +n-1. For example, if the maximum k is 15000, then a is 15000 +500-1=15499. So precompute fact up to 15499.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 15499.

But wait, how do we know the maximum possible a in advance? Because the maximum k depends on the input. For example, if in the input all a_i are primes, and each is different, then each prime's exponent is 1, and the number of such primes is 500, which would lead to k=1 for each. Then, for each, a=1 +500-1=500. So for each such case, a is 500. But if a prime's exponent is 15000, then a is 15499.

But during precomputation, since the maximum possible a is not known in advance, perhaps we can compute the maximum possible a based on the input.

Wait, but precomputing for each test case is not feasible because the precomputation could take O(m) time, which for m=1e5 is manageable. But in Python, precomputing fact and inv_fact up to 2e5 is possible.

Alternatively, during the problem solving process, first factorize all a_i to find the maximum possible k (sum of exponents for each prime). Then compute the maximum a as max_k +n-1, and precompute fact up to that maximum a. But this would require factorizing first, then precomputing, then processing each prime's exponents.

But factorizing first would require processing all a_i, which is necessary. So the steps would be:

- Factorize all a_i into primes, aggregate exponents. For each prime, compute the sum of exponents. Let's call this sum k for the prime.

- For all primes in the factorization, compute their k, and find the maximum (k +n-1) across all primes.

- Precompute fact and inv_fact up to this maximum value.

- Then, for each prime's k, compute C(k +n-1, n-1) using the precomputed fact and inv_fact.

Multiply all these combinations together modulo 1e9+7.

But how to precompute the fact and inv_fact after knowing the maximum required? Let's see:

In Python, the steps would be:

1. Read n and the list a.

2. For each number in a, factorize into primes, and accumulate the exponents in a dictionary (prime: total_exponent).

3. For each prime in the dictionary, calculate (k +n-1) and track the maximum such value.

4. Precompute fact and inv_fact up to this maximum value.

5. For each prime's k, compute the combination C(k +n-1, n-1) as fact[k +n-1] * inv_fact[n-1] * inv_fact[k] % MOD.

6. Multiply all these values together, modulo MOD.

So the main challenge is factorizing each a_i efficiently, and then precomputing the necessary factorials.

Let's start with the factorization part. Let's implement a trial division function.

For factorization:

def factorize(x):
    factors = {}
    while x % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) +1
        x = x //2
    i =3
    max_i = math.isqrt(x) +1
    while i <= max_i and x !=1:
        while x %i ==0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) +1
            x = x //i
            max_i = math.isqrt(x) +1 # update the max_i after division
        i +=2
    if x !=1:
        factors[x] = factors.get(x, 0)+1
    return factors

But for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible. For example, 1e9's square root is 31622, which is manageable.

But let's think about edge cases. For example, x is a prime number itself. Then, the code will find it after checking up to sqrt(x). For x=1e9, sqrt(x) is 31622. So when x is a prime larger than that, it will be added as a factor.

So this function should work.

Once all a_i are factorized, we can accumulate the exponents into a global dictionary.

Next, for each prime's exponent k, compute the combination.

The key is precomputing factorials and inverse factorials up to the maximum a =k +n-1.

So let's say after processing all primes, the maximum a is max_a. Then, we need to compute fact[0..max_a], inv_fact[0..max_a], mod 1e9+7.

The mod is 1e9+7, which is a prime, so we can compute inv_fact using Fermat's little theorem.

So precompute fact as:

max_fact = max(k +n-1 for primes' k)
fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)
for i in 1 to max_fact:
    fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)
inv_fact[max_fact] = pow(fact[max_fact], MOD-2, MOD)
for i in max_fact-1 down to 0:
    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

Then, for each k in primes' exponents, compute:

comb = fact[k +n-1] * inv_fact[n-1] % MOD
comb = comb * inv_fact[k] % MOD
result *= comb
result %= MOD

But what if a prime has k=0? Wait, no. Because m is the product of a_i's. If a prime is present in m, then its exponent is the sum of exponents from a_i's. So during the factorization, each prime in the dictionary has k>=1.

So the steps are correct.

Now, let's think about possible edge cases.

For example, the first sample input:

n=1, a=[15]. m=15. The possible decompositions are [15]. So the answer is 1.

Because when n=1, the decomposition must be [m], since the product has to be m. So the combination for each prime's exponent is C(k +0, 0) = 1. So for each prime's exponent, the combination is 1. So product is 1*1=1. So correct.

Second sample: 3 numbers [1,1,2]. m=2. The primes are 2^1. So the combination is C(1 +3-1, 3-1) = C(3,2) =3. Which matches the sample output.

Third sample: [5,7], product 35. The primes are 5 and 7, each with exponent 1. For each, combination is C(1+2-1, 2-1) = C(2,1) =2. So total is 2*2=4, which is the sample output.

So the approach works.

Now, the code steps:

1. Read n.

2. Read the list a.

3. For each number in a, factorize into primes and accumulate the exponents in a dictionary.

4. If the dictionary is empty (all a_i are 1), then m=1, and the decomposition is (1,1,...,1). So answer is 1. But wait, if all a_i are 1, then the product is 1. So the decomposition is a tuple of n 1s. So only one decomposition. So the code needs to handle that.

But according to the problem statement, the decomposition into n ordered multipliers must be considered. So if m=1, then all the b_i must be 1. So the answer is 1 in that case.

So during the code, if after factorization, there are no primes (since m=1), then the answer is 1.

Otherwise, proceed to compute the combinations.

So code outline:

- Initialize a primes dictionary.

- For each number in a:

   if the number is 1, skip (since 1 has no prime factors)

   else, factorize, then add each prime to the primes dict.

So in the code:

primes = defaultdict(int)

for num in a:

   if num ==1:

       continue

   factors = factorize(num)

   for p, cnt in factors.items():

       primes[p] += cnt

if not primes:

   print(1)

else:

   compute the combinations.

So that's handled.

Next, compute the maximum (k +n-1) across all primes. Let's call it max_a.

max_a = 0

for k in primes.values():

    current = k + (n-1)

    if current > max_a:

        max_a = current

Now, precompute fact and inv_fact up to max_a.

But what if max_a is 0? That can't happen because primes is not empty here.

Once fact and inv_fact are precomputed, the result is the product of combinations for each prime.

Now, code for precomputing:

MOD = 10**9+7

max_fact = max_a

fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)

for i in range(1, max_fact+1):

    fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(max_fact+1)

inv_fact[max_fact] = pow(fact[max_fact], MOD-2, MOD)

for i in range(max_fact-1, -1, -1):

    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

Then, for each prime's exponent k:

res =1

for k in primes.values():

    a = k + n-1

    b = n-1

    # compute C(a, b) = fact[a] * inv_fact[b] * inv_fact[a -b] mod MOD

    c = fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD

    c = c * inv_fact[k] % MOD # since a -b =k

    res = res * c % MOD

print(res)

So this should work.

But let's test for the third sample:

n=2, primes 5 and 7 each with k=1.

max_a =1+2-1=2.

precompute fact up to 2: fact = [1,1,2]

inv_fact[2] = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) = 500000004.

Then inv_fact[1] = inv_fact[2] *2 mod MOD = 500000004*2 mod MOD = 1,000,000,008 mod 1e9+7 =1.

inv_fact[0] = inv_fact[1] *1 mod MOD =1.

So for each k=1:

a=1+1=2.

C(2,1) = fact[2] * inv_fact[1] * inv_fact[1] = 2 *1 *1 =2 mod MOD.

So 2*2=4.

Yes, correct.

Another example: when n=500 and k=15000.

But code will handle that.

Now, code for factorization:

But the factorization function may need to handle 1, but in the code, numbers equal to 1 are skipped.

But what if a number is 0? But according to the problem statement, the a_i are positive integers, so 0 is not allowed. So no problem.

Now, code for factorize:

But in the problem statement, the input a_i are positive integers, so we can assume that.

So, code for factorize:

import math

def factorize(x):

    factors = {}

    while x % 2 ==0:

        factors[2] = factors.get(2,0)+1

        x = x//2

    i=3

    max_i = math.isqrt(x) +1

    while i <= max_i and x !=1:

        while x %i ==0:

            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0)+1

            x = x //i

            max_i = math.isqrt(x) +1 # update max_i after division

        i +=2

    if x !=1:

        factors[x] = factors.get(x,0)+1

    return factors

But wait, for x=1, the function returns empty dict. Which is correct. But in our code, numbers equal to 1 are skipped, so the factors for 1 are not added to the primes dict.

So this should be okay.

Putting it all together.

So the code steps:

Read n.

Read list a.

primes = defaultdict(int)

for num in a:

    if num ==1:

        continue

    factors = factorize(num)

    for p, cnt in factors.items():

        primes[p] += cnt

if not primes:

    print(1)

else:

    # compute max_a

    max_a = max(k +n-1 for k in primes.values())

    # precompute fact and inv_fact up to max_a

    MOD = 10**9 +7

    fact = [1]*(max_a +1)

    for i in range(1, max_a+1):

        fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i % MOD

    inv_fact = [1]*(max_a +1)

    inv_fact[max_a] = pow(fact[max_a], MOD-2, MOD)

    for i in range(max_a-1, -1, -1):

        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

    res =1

    for k in primes.values():

        a_val = k +n-1

        comb = fact[a_val] * inv_fact[n-1] % MOD

        comb = comb * inv_fact[k] % MOD

        res = res * comb % MOD

    print(res)

But need to import necessary modules.

So the code will need to import math and from collections import defaultdict.

But in Python, the code should start with those imports.

So the complete code would be:
