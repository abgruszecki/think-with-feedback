Okay, let's see. The problem is about a glider jumping out of a plane and trying to maximize the horizontal distance flown. The plane is moving along the Ox axis at height h. The glider can jump out at any integer x-coordinate. When he's in the air, he descends 1 unit per second unless he's in an ascending airflow segment. Those segments make him not descend. The segments are given in order, non-overlapping, sorted.

So the task is to find the maximum possible distance between the start and end points of his flight. The flight ends when he hits the ground (y=0). The key is to find the best starting point (x) such that the glider can utilize as many ascending segments as possible to prolong his flight time.

Hmm. Let's think about how the glider's flight works. When he starts at some x0, he moves right at 1 unit per second. His altitude starts at h. For each second, if he's on a segment that's an ascending airflow, he doesn't lose altitude. Otherwise, he loses 1 per second. The flight ends when his altitude reaches 0. So the total time he can stay in the air is h (initial) minus the number of seconds he wasn't in an ascending segment. Wait, no. Because during the ascending segments, he doesn't lose altitude, so the total time in the air is h plus the number of seconds he's in ascending segments. Wait, no. Let's see:

The initial altitude is h. Each second he's not in a segment, he loses 1. For each such second, the altitude decreases by 1. The flight ends when altitude becomes 0. So the total time he can fly is h + (time spent in ascending segments). Because during those segments, he doesn't lose altitude. So the total time is the number of seconds in non-segment time where he's losing altitude. Wait, maybe not. Let's model it.

Suppose he starts at time t=0 at position x0. Each second, he moves right by 1. Let's say his altitude is h. For each second, if he's in a segment, he stays at the same altitude. Otherwise, his altitude decreases by 1. The flight ends when his altitude reaches 0. So the total time is the number of seconds he can survive until altitude 0.

Alternatively, the flight duration is the initial h plus the number of ascending seconds. Because every second not in a segment reduces altitude by 1, and every second in a segment doesn't. So the total time is the number of seconds until h - (non_ascending_seconds) = 0. So non_ascending_seconds = h. So the total time is non_ascending_seconds + ascending_seconds = h + ascending_seconds. Because during each ascending second, he doesn't lose altitude, so those seconds don't count towards the altitude loss. So the total flight time is h + (number of ascending seconds), but only if the sum of non-ascending seconds is exactly h. Wait, maybe not. Let me re-express this.

Let T be the total flight time. Let A be the number of seconds spent in ascending segments. Then, the altitude lost is (T - A) = h. So T = h + A. Because T is the total time, and (T - A) is the number of seconds where he's descending, each of those seconds subtracts 1 from altitude. So (T - A) = h. Therefore, T = h + A. So the total flight time is h plus the number of ascending seconds. So the maximum possible T is when A is maximized. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible consecutive sequence of ascending segments where the sum of their lengths (since each segment is a consecutive x interval, so length is x2 - x1, which equals the number of seconds in that segment) is as large as possible, but also the starting position allows the glider to reach those segments and stay in them as much as possible.

Wait, but the segments are sorted. So perhaps the optimal path is a window of consecutive segments where the glider can land in all of them, and the sum of their lengths plus the gaps between them (if any) plus the initial and final parts?

Wait, perhaps the optimal scenario is when the glider starts just before a group of consecutive segments, such that the time he spends in the air (h + sum of their lengths) allows him to cover those segments plus any possible movement before and after. Wait, maybe not. Let's think with an example.

Take the first sample input:

3 4

Segments: [2,5], [7,9], [10,11]

The optimal starting point is x=2. The glider starts at x=2, then moves right. The first segment is 2-5 (3 seconds). Then, after that, he's in non-segment areas. The total time is h + A = 4 + 3 (from the first segment) + 1 (the second segment 7-9 is length 2, but perhaps he uses 2 seconds there) + 1 (third segment). Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:

Wait the sample output is 10. The flight is from x=2 to x=12, which is 10 units. So time is 10 seconds. Because h=4. So h + A = 10. Therefore A must be 6. So the sum of ascending seconds is 6. Looking at the first sample's segments: 5-2=3 (3 seconds), 9-7=2, 11-10=1. 3+2+1=6. So all three segments. But how does the glider reach them all?

Starting at x=2. The first segment starts at x=2. So he is in the first segment from x=2 to x=5 (3 seconds). Then, he's moving into x=5,6,7. The next segment is 7-9. So x=5 and 6 are outside segments. So for each of those two steps (x=5,6), he is not in a segment, so he loses altitude. But in this case, the total time is 10 seconds. So h + A = 4 +6=10. So that makes sense.

But how does he get through the non-segment regions between 5 and 7? Because during that time (x=5 to 6, 6 to7) he's not in a segment. So for each of those steps, he loses altitude. Let's see: he starts at x=2, altitude 4. Time steps:

After 3 seconds in the first segment: altitude remains 4. Then, he moves into x=5 (time 3). Then x=6 (time4). Then x=7 (time5). At time3, he's at x5. Since the first segment is x2=5, the segment includes x5? Wait, the segments are given as x1 and x2. So the segment is [x1, x2), or [x1, x2]? The problem statement says "segments characterized by x1 and x2 (x1 < x2) representing its endpoints." So the segment is [x1, x2], inclusive? Because in the first sample, the first segment is 2-5. So when the glider is at x=2,3,4,5, he's in the segment.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, the glider starts at x=2 (which is part of the first segment). So during that first second (or each second) he is moving right by 1. So for each x in [2,5], he's in the segment. The segment is x1=2, x2=5. So length 3 (5-2 =3? Or 5-2+1=4? Wait no, because x1 and x2 are endpoints, and the segment is from x1 to x2. So the number of units is x2 -x1. Because each second, he moves 1 unit. So for a segment from x1 to x2, he spends (x2 -x1) seconds in it. For example, if x1=2 and x2=5, that's 3 units (from x=2 to x=5, 3 steps: 2→3→4→5? Wait, 2→3 is step 1, 3→4 step 2, 4→5 step 3. So 3 steps. So the length is 5-2=3.

So in the first sample, the three segments have lengths 3, 2, 1, sum 6. So the total time is h +6 =10. So during those 10 seconds, he is moving right 10 units. So starting at x=2, ends at x=12. So the distance is 10.

So the problem is to find a set of consecutive segments (possibly just one) that the glider can pass through, such that the total time is h plus the sum of the lengths of the segments in the set, and the starting position allows him to reach those segments.

But how? Let's model it.

The glider's flight starts at some x0. The flight lasts T seconds, which is h + A, where A is the total time spent in ascending segments. During T seconds, he moves from x0 to x0 + T. The segments that he covers during this time are a subset of the given segments. The key is to select a window of consecutive segments such that the sum of their lengths (A) plus h equals T, which is the total flight time. The starting x0 must be chosen such that the entire flight path (x0 to x0+T) covers as many segments as possible, but also the non-segment parts in between don't require the glider to run out of altitude.

Wait, perhaps not. The key is that the glider can start at any x0 (integer) such that during his flight time T = h + A, he can collect as much A as possible, but the x0 must be such that all the segments he uses are within [x0, x0 + T), and the segments are consecutive.

Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to find a consecutive set of segments such that the sum of their lengths (A) plus h is the maximum possible. Then, the distance is T = h + A, which would be the maximum.

But how do the segments need to be arranged for that? Let's think of the segments as sorted. So they are given in order, so x1 of each next segment is after x2 of the previous. So there's no overlapping.

Suppose we select a window of consecutive segments. The sum of their lengths is A. Then the total flight time is h + A. During that time, the glider moves h + A units to the right. So the flight starts at x0 and ends at x0 + h + A.

But to collect all the A time from the segments in the window, the entire window of segments must be covered during the flight. So the starting x0 must be <= the first segment's x1, and the ending x0 + h + A must be >= the last segment's x2. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the glider's flight path is from x0 to x0 + T. The segments in the window must be entirely within this interval, otherwise the glider would not spend the entire length of the segments in the flight.

Wait, for example, if a segment is [a, b], then to have the glider spend (b -a) seconds in it, the entire segment must be covered by the flight path. So a >= x0 and b <= x0 + T. Because during the flight, the glider is moving from x0 to x0 + T. So any segment that is within this interval contributes their full length to A. But if a segment is partially covered, then the time spent in it is min(x0 + T, x2) - max(x0, x1). But in that case, how can that be optimized?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to select a set of consecutive segments (since they are sorted) such that the sum of their lengths is as large as possible, and the time needed to cover the gaps between the segments (the non-segment regions between them) plus the initial and final gaps is within the h available.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to maximize A (sum of lengths of consecutive segments) and minimize the required h.

Wait, the problem is to maximize T = h + A, which is the flight time. But T is the distance (since each second the glider moves 1 unit). So maximizing T is the same as maximizing the distance. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible h + A, where A is the sum of a consecutive set of segments, and the required 'h' must be at least the sum of the gaps between those segments and the initial and final gaps.

Wait, this seems like a sliding window problem.

Let me explain. Suppose we select a window of consecutive segments. The sum A is the sum of (x2 - x1) for each segment in the window. The required time T is h + A. But during this T, the glider must have enough time to cover the entire window plus any gaps between the segments, and the initial and final parts.

Wait, maybe the required 'h' must be enough to cover the gaps between the start of the flight and the first segment, the gaps between consecutive segments in the window, and the gap after the last segment until the flight ends. Because during those gaps, the glider is not in any segment, so he's losing altitude. But since the flight ends when altitude reaches 0, the total of these gaps plus the h must be exactly equal to the time not covered by ascending segments. Hmm, perhaps this is the key.

Wait, the flight time T is h + A. The time not in ascending segments is T - A = h. So the total time not in ascending segments is exactly h. But those h seconds are spent in the gaps: the initial part (from x0 to the first segment's x1), the gaps between consecutive segments, and the final part (from the last segment's x2 to x0 + T). Each of these gaps contributes to the h seconds. So the sum of these gaps must be <= h. Because those gaps are the time when the glider is not in a segment, and those are the times when altitude is lost. Since the total time not in segments is h, which is the initial altitude, the sum of all the gaps (initial, between, and final) must be exactly h.

So the problem is to find a consecutive window of segments such that the sum of the gaps (initial, between, and final) is <= h, and the sum of the gaps is exactly h. Wait, no. Because the total time not in segments is h, which equals the sum of all gaps. So for a window of segments, the sum of the initial gap (x1_start - x0), the gaps between segments (x_{i+1}_start - x_i_end for each consecutive pair in the window), and the final gap (x0 + T - x_end) must equal h. Because each of these gaps represents the time the glider is not in a segment and thus losing altitude. So sum_gaps = h.

But how can we model this?

Let's say we have a window of segments from i to j. The initial gap is the distance between x0 and x_i1 (the start of the first segment in the window). But x0 can be anywhere such that x0 + T (T = h + A) covers all these segments and the gaps sum to h.

Alternatively, the optimal approach is to find a window of consecutive segments such that the required initial and final gaps plus the gaps between the segments sum up to exactly h, allowing the glider to use all the segments in the window.

But how to model this?

Let me think in terms of the window of segments. Suppose the window is segments from i to j. The sum of their lengths is A = sum_{k=i to j} (x2_k - x1_k). The total time is T = h + A.

The flight starts at x0 and ends at x0 + T. The segments in the window must be covered during this flight.

The first segment in the window is x_i1. So the glider must reach x_i1 during his flight. The flight starts at x0. So x0 <= x_i1. Similarly, the flight ends at x0 + T >= x_j2 (the end of the last segment). But perhaps that's not the case. For example, maybe the flight starts after x_i1, but in that case, the initial part of the segment is not covered. So to collect the entire A, the entire window of segments must be covered by the flight.

Wait, but how can the flight include a segment if x0 is before x_i1? For example, if the flight starts at x0 = x_i1 - 5, then the first 5 seconds are not in the segment. Then, during those 5 seconds, the glider is losing altitude. But then, the sum of the gaps (like the initial gap here) would be part of the h.

So, to model this correctly:

For a window of segments from i to j:

- The sum of the gaps is (x_i1 - x0) + (x_i2 to x_{i+1}1) for all consecutive segments in the window) + (x0 + T - x_j2) = sum_gaps.

This sum_gaps must equal h. Because those are the seconds when the glider is not in any segment, so each second contributes 1 to the altitude loss. Since initial altitude is h, sum_gaps must be exactly h.

But how do we choose x0 and T such that this is the case?

But T is h + A. So substituting T = h + A, we get:

sum_gaps = (x_i1 - x0) + sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (x_{k+1}1 - x_k2) ) + (x0 + h + A - x_j2) ) = h.

Let's compute this:

sum_gaps = x_i1 - x0 + sum(gaps between segments) + (x0 + h + A - x_j2)

sum_gaps = x_i1 -x0 + sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (x_{k+1}1 - x_k2) ) + x0 + h + A - x_j2

Simplify:

x_i1 -x0 + x0 + ... → the x0 terms cancel.

sum_gaps = x_i1 + sum(gaps) + h + A -x_j2

sum(gaps) between the segments is sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (x_{k+1}1 - x_k2) )

The sum of the gaps between segments is the total distance between the end of a segment and the start of the next. So for segments i to j, the total gaps between them is (x_{i+1}1 - x_i2) + (x_{i+2}1 -x_{i+1}2) + ... + (x_j1 - x_{j-1}2} )

The sum of these gaps plus the sum of the segments' lengths (A) gives x_j2 - x_i1. Because:

sum_{k=i}^j (x2_k -x1_k) = x_j2 - x_i1 + (sum of gaps between segments). Wait no. Let me see:

The sum of the segments (each x2 -x1) is (x_i2 -x_i1) + (x_{i+1}2 -x_{i+1}1) + ... + (x_j2 - x_j1).

The sum of the gaps between segments is (x_{i+1}1 -x_i2) + ... + (x_j1 -x_{j-1}2} )

So the total length from x_i1 to x_j2 is (x_j2 -x_i1) = sum(segments) + sum(gaps between segments).

So in the sum_gaps equation:

sum_gaps = x_i1 + sum(gaps between segments) + h + A - x_j2

But A is sum(segments) = (x_i2 -x_i1) + ... + (x_j2 -x_j1) = x_j2 - x_i1 - sum(gaps between segments) ?

Wait, no. Because sum(segments) = (x_i2 -x_i1) + (x_{i+1}2 - x_{i+1}1) + ... + (x_j2 -x_j1) ) 

Which can be rewritten as (x_j2 -x_i1) - sum(gaps between segments). Because:

sum(segments) + sum(gaps between segments) = (x_i2 -x_i1) + (gaps) + ... etc. = x_j2 -x_i1.

So sum(segments) = x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(gaps between segments).

So substituting back into the sum_gaps equation:

sum_gaps = x_i1 + sum(gaps between) + h + A -x_j2

But A is x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(gaps between), so substituting:

sum_gaps = x_i1 + sum(gaps between) + h + (x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(gaps between)) ) -x_j2 

= x_i1 + sum(gaps between) + h + x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(gaps between) -x_j2 

= h 

So sum_gaps = h, which is exactly what we need. So regardless of the window of segments, sum_gaps is equal to h. So this equation holds for any window of segments.

Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of the window of consecutive segments, the sum_gaps is exactly h. Because when you choose T = h + A, the sum_gaps automatically equals h. So this suggests that for any consecutive window of segments, there's a way to choose x0 such that the sum_gaps is exactly h. So the maximum possible A is the maximum sum of consecutive segments' lengths, and the maximum possible T is h + A, which is the distance.

Wait, but this can't be. Because the sum_gaps is always h. Then, for any consecutive window of segments, you can find an x0 such that the sum of the initial gap, gaps between, and final gap equals h. So in that case, the maximum possible T is h + A, where A is the maximum sum of consecutive segments. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible A (sum of consecutive segments) and then adding h to get T. But then the answer would be T, which is the maximum possible distance.

But this contradicts the sample inputs. Let's see.

In the first sample:

A is 3 + 2 + 1 =6. h=4. T=10. Which matches the sample. So yes.

In the third sample, the sum A is 999,999,999. h is 1e9. T is 1e9 + 999,999,999 = 1,999,999,999. Which matches the sample.

But what about the second sample?

Second sample input:

5 10

Segments:

5-7 (2), 11-12 (1), 16-20 (4), 25-26 (1), 30-33 (3)

The sum of consecutive segments that gives the maximum A is 4 (16-20) +1 (25-26) +3 (30-33) = 8? Or wait, perhaps the window is 16-20, 25-26, 30-33. Their lengths are 4, 1,3. Sum 8. Adding h=10, T=18. Which matches the sample output of 18.

So indeed, the maximum A is 8, and h=10 gives T=18.

So according to this logic, the maximum T is the sum of the maximum consecutive segments' lengths plus h.

But why? Because for any consecutive window of segments, the sum_gaps is automatically h. So the initial x0 can be chosen such that the sum of the initial, between, and final gaps is h.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of consecutive segments' lengths, then adding h to get the answer.

Wait, but how? Because the segments are sorted, so the maximum consecutive sum would be the sum of all segments. But in the first sample, the sum of all three is 6, which with h=4 gives 10. Which is correct.

But what if there are segments that are spaced far apart, such that the sum of their lengths is maximum, but the required initial and final gaps would have to be such that the sum_gaps equals h. But according to our earlier conclusion, sum_gaps is always h for any consecutive window of segments. So regardless of which window we choose, the sum of gaps is h. So the answer is simply h plus the maximum sum of consecutive segments.

So the problem is to find the maximum sum of consecutive segments, then add h. That's the answer.

But that's seems too easy. Let me check with the third sample. The sum is 999,999,999 (the only segment). h=1e9. So T is 1e9 + 999,999,999 = 1,999,999,999. Which matches the sample.

So why is the answer in the second sample 18? Because the sum of the selected segments is 8 (16-20 (4), 25-26 (1), 30-33 (3)), sum 8. 8+10=18.

So according to this logic, the correct approach is to find the maximum possible sum of consecutive segments, then add h.

But how can that be? Let's think of another example. Suppose there are two segments: [1,3] (2 units) and [5,6] (1 unit). h=2. So the maximum sum is 3 (1+2). Then T=2+3=5. But how can the glider cover both segments with h=2.

The sum of the gaps would be:

sum_gaps = initial gap (1 - x0) + gap between segments (5-3) + final gap (x0 +5 -6).

sum_gaps = (1 - x0) + 2 + (x0 +5 -6) = 1 -x0 +2 + x0 -1 = 2. Which equals h=2.

So yes. The sum_gaps is 2. So the x0 can be any value such that:

1 -x0 >=0 (so x0 <=1) and x0 +5 >=6 (x0 >=1). So x0 must be 1. Then the initial gap is 0 (1-1), the gap between is 2, final gap is (1+5-6)=0. Sum is 0+2+0=2=h.

So the flight is from x0=1 to x0+5=6. The segments [1,3] and [5,6] are covered. So during the flight, the glider spends 2+1=3 seconds in segments, sum_gaps=2. So T=3+2=5. So the distance is 5.

So this seems to work. So the approach is correct.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of consecutive segments' lengths (A) and adding h to get T, which is the answer. Because the sum_gaps is always h for any consecutive window of segments, and there exists an x0 (specifically, x0 = x_i1 - initial_gap, where initial_gap + ... = h) that allows the glider to start such that all the segments in the window are covered, and the sum of the gaps is exactly h.

So the solution is:

- Compute the sum of all possible consecutive segments' windows, and find the maximum sum (A_max).

- The answer is A_max + h.

But wait, why can't the glider fly through a set of segments that are not consecutive? For example, if there are three segments, and the first and third have large lengths, but the second is small. Then maybe selecting the first and third would have a larger sum. But according to our earlier logic, the sum_gaps is computed for consecutive segments, and non-consecutive would have larger gaps between, leading to higher sum_gaps (but sum_gaps must equal h).

But in that case, the sum of the segments' lengths plus h is the same as the sum of the consecutive segments. But since the sum of the consecutive segments would be larger (because the non-consecutive case would require more gaps between, which reduces the sum of the segments that can be covered within h sum_gaps).

Wait, no. Because the sum of the gaps is h. But for non-consecutive segments, the gaps between them would be larger. So for example, if we have segments A and C (with B in between), the sum of the gaps would include the gap between A and B and between B and C. So for the same sum of segments (A and C's lengths), the sum of gaps is larger, thus requiring h to be larger. But since h is fixed, we can't choose that. So the only way to maximize A is to choose consecutive segments, as any non-consecutive segments would require more gaps, leading to a lower possible A for a fixed h.

Thus, the optimal solution is to select consecutive segments. Therefore, the problem is indeed to find the maximum sum of consecutive segments' lengths (A), and the answer is A + h.

So the approach is to compute the maximum possible sum of any consecutive subarray of the segments' lengths.

But wait, the segments are given in order. So the maximum sum of consecutive segments is simply the maximum sum of a consecutive subarray of the list of segments' lengths.

So this becomes the classic maximum subarray problem (Kadane's algorithm), but with the entire array being processed. Since the segments are already in order, and their lengths are non-negative (since x1 < x2 for all), then the maximum subarray is either the entire array or a part of it. But wait, the segments' lengths are all positive (since x1 < x2). So the maximum possible sum is the sum of all segments. But perhaps there's a case where some segments are not part of the maximum subarray.

For example, if there are segments with lengths 3, 4, -5, 6. But in our case, all lengths are positive. So the maximum subarray is the entire array. But in our case, all lengths are positive, so the maximum sum is the sum of all segments. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the segments are arranged such that there's a gap between them that requires a large initial or final gap. But according to our previous analysis, the sum of gaps is automatically h, regardless of the window. So the maximum sum of consecutive segments is the answer.

Wait, but the maximum sum of consecutive segments is the sum of all segments. So the answer is sum(all segments) + h. But this isn't the case for the second sample.

Wait, in the second sample:

Segments lengths are:

5-7:2

11-12:1

16-20:4

25-26:1

30-33:3

Sum all segments: 2+1+4+1+3=11. So the answer would be 11+10=21. But the sample's answer is 18. So why is this the case?

Ah! So my previous analysis is wrong. What's the issue here?

In the second sample, the maximum sum of consecutive segments is 4+1+3=8 (segments 3,4,5). So the answer is 8+10=18. But according to the previous logic, why isn't the sum of all segments (11) plus h (10) =21 the answer?

Because in that case, the sum of gaps would be h=10, but the required sum of gaps for the entire window would be:

sum_gaps = initial gap (x1 -x0) + sum of gaps between segments ( (11-7)+(16-12)+(25-20)+(30-26) ) = (4 +4 +5 +4) =17, plus final gap (x0 +21 -33). Wait, sum_gaps must equal h=10. But according to the previous calculation, sum_gaps is h=10. But in this case, with the entire window of segments (sum A=11), sum_gaps is 10. So how does that work?

Wait, let's compute sum_gaps:

sum_gaps = (x_i1 -x0) + sum(gaps between segments) + (x0 + T -x_j2 )

T = h + A =10+11=21.

x_i1 is the first segment's x1 (5). x_j2 is last segment's x2 (33).

sum(gaps between) is (11-7) + (16-12) + (25-20) + (30-26) =4+4+5+4=17.

So sum_gaps =5 -x0 +17 + (x0 +21 -33) 

=5 -x0 +17 +x0 +21 -33 

=5 +17 +21 -33 

=43-33=10.

Which equals h=10. So sum_gaps is correct.

But then why isn't the answer 21 in this sample?

Ah! Because the flight path must start at x0 such that:

x0 <=5 (x_i1=5)

x0 +21 >=33 → x0 >=12.

But 5 >=x0 >=12 is impossible. So there's no x0 that satisfies both conditions. Thus, even though the sum_gaps equals h, there's no possible x0 that allows the flight to cover all segments. Hence, the window of all segments is not possible.

Ah, this is a flaw in the previous logic. The initial analysis assumed that sum_gaps equals h, but it's possible that the x0 required to achieve that is invalid. For example, if the sum_gaps equations require x0 to be in a range that's impossible.

So the problem is more complex. So the previous approach is incorrect.

So the initial assumption that any consecutive window of segments can be used is wrong. Because there's no valid x0 that satisfies the required constraints.

So what's the correct way to model this?

The sum_gaps must equal h, but the x0 must be such that:

x0 <= x_i1 (the first segment's start)

x0 + T >=x_j2 (the last segment's end)

But T = h + A.

So substituting T:

x0 + h + A >=x_j2 → x0 >=x_j2 - (h + A)

Also, x0 <=x_i1.

Combining these:

x_j2 - (h +A) <=x0 <=x_i1

So the feasible x0 exists only if x_j2 - (h +A) <=x_i1.

Which can be rewritten as x_j2 -x_i1 <= h + A.

But x_j2 -x_i1 = sum of the segments in the window plus the sum of the gaps between them.

sum_segments (A) + sum_gaps_between = x_j2 -x_i1.

So x_j2 -x_i1 <= h + A → sum_segments + sum_gaps_between <= h + sum_segments → sum_gaps_between <=h.

But sum_gaps_between is the sum of the gaps between consecutive segments in the window.

But sum_gaps_between is part of the sum_gaps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to re-express the condition.

The feasible x0 exists if x_j2 -x_i1 <= h +A.

But A is the sum of the segments in the window.

So x_j2 -x_i1 = sum(segments) + sum(gaps between segments) → sum(gaps between) = x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(segments).

So substituting into the condition:

x_j2 -x_i1 <=h + sum(segments) → sum(gaps between) + sum(segments) <= h + sum(segments) → sum(gaps between) <=h.

But sum(gaps between) is the sum of the gaps between consecutive segments in the window. So the sum of gaps between segments in the window must be <=h.

But sum(gaps between) can vary depending on the window.

So the window of segments must satisfy:

sum(gaps between segments in the window) <=h.

Because sum(gaps between) = x_j2 -x_i1 - sum(segments).

Which must be <=h.

So for a window of segments i to j, the sum of the gaps between consecutive segments in the window (sum_gaps_between) must be <=h.

Otherwise, even though sum_gaps is h, there's no x0 that allows the flight to cover all segments in the window.

So this adds a new constraint to the problem. The window i to j must have sum_gaps_between <=h.

So the problem now is to find a consecutive window of segments i to j, such that sum_gaps_between (sum of gaps between consecutive segments in the window) <=h. Among all such possible windows, find the one with the maximum sum of segments' lengths (A), and the answer is A +h.

So how do we compute this?

We can model this as a sliding window problem. For each j, find the earliest i such that the sum of gaps between segments from i to j is <=h. For each j, compute the maximum possible A (sum of segments from i to j) where sum_gaps_between <=h.

The sum_gaps_between for the window i to j is sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (x_{k+1}1 -x_k2).

So the problem is similar to the maximum subarray sum with the constraint that the sum of the gaps between segments in the window is <=h.

So how can this be efficiently computed?

We need to find for each j, the earliest i where the sum of gaps between i to j-1 is <=h. Then, the maximum sum of segments from i to j is the sum of their lengths.

But since the segments are sorted, the gaps between consecutive segments (x_{k+1}1 -x_k2) are all positive. So sum_gaps_between is the sum of these gaps between segments in the window. So for a window of consecutive segments, the sum_gaps_between is the sum of the gaps between each pair in the window.

The sum of gaps_between for the window i to j is the sum from k=i to j-1 of (x_{k+1}1 - x_k2).

Let's denote this as G[i][j].

We need to find windows where G[i][j] <=h.

For each j, we need to find the smallest possible i such that G[i][j] <=h. Then, for each j, compute the sum of segments from i to j (A) and take the maximum A +h.

So the approach would be to use a sliding window (two pointers) approach.

Initialize left=0, current_gaps=0, max_A=0.

For each right in 0 to n-1:

   if right >0:

       current_gaps += (x[right].x1 - x[right-1].x2)

   while current_gaps >h and left < right:

       current_gaps -= (x[left+1].x1 - x[left].x2)

       left +=1

   current_A = sum of x[k].x2 -x[k].x1 for k from left to right.

   max_A = max(max_A, current_A)

But this requires maintaining the sum of segments in the current window and the sum of gaps between segments.

But maintaining the sum of segments can be done with a prefix sum array.

Yes. Let's precompute prefix sums of the segment lengths.

prefix_sum[0] =0

prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + (x[i-1].x2 -x[i-1].x1)

Then, sum of segments from i to j is prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].

Sum of gaps between segments from i to j-1 is the sum of gaps between i and j-1.

Which can be precomputed with another prefix array.

Let's create an array gaps, where gaps[i] is the gap between segment i and segment i+1.

gaps[i] = x[i+1].x1 - x[i].x2.

Then, the prefix_gaps array:

prefix_gaps[0] =0

prefix_gaps[i] = prefix_gaps[i-1] + gaps[i-1]

So the sum of gaps between segments i and j-1 is prefix_gaps[j] - prefix_gaps[i].

Thus, for a window from left to right:

sum_gaps_between = prefix_gaps[right] - prefix_gaps[left]

We need sum_gaps_between <=h.

So the two pointers approach can be used.

Initialize left=0.

For each right in 0 to n-1:

   if right>0:

       sum_gaps_between += gaps[right-1]

   while sum_gaps_between >h and left < right:

       sum_gaps_between -= gaps[left]

       left +=1

   current_A = prefix_sum[right+1] - prefix_sum[left]

   max_A = max(max_A, current_A)

So this way, for each right, we find the earliest left such that sum_gaps_between (gaps from left to right-1) <=h. Then compute the sum of segments from left to right.

Yes, that's correct.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the gaps between consecutive segments.

2. Precompute prefix_sum for the segment lengths.

3. Precompute prefix_gaps for the gaps between segments.

4. Use a sliding window approach to find, for each right, the earliest left where the sum of gaps between left and right-1 is <=h.

5. For each such window, compute the sum of the segments and track the maximum.

6. The answer is the maximum sum plus h.

This approach is O(n) time, which is suitable for n=2e5.

Let's test this with the second sample.

Sample input 2:

5 10

5 7 → length 2

11 12 → length 1

16 20 → length4 

25 26 → length1 

30 33 → length3 

The gaps between segments are:

Between 0 and 1: 11-7=4

Between 1 and 2:16-12=4

Between 2 and 3:25-20=5

Between 3 and4:30-26=4

So gaps array is [4,4,5,4].

prefix_gaps is [0,4,8,13,17].

sum_gaps_between between left=0 and right=0 (window 0) is 0. Because right=0 implies no gaps.

For right=0, left=0. sum_gaps_between=0<=10. current_A=2. max_A=2.

right=1: sum_gaps_between=4.

sum 4 <=10. current_A=2+1=3. max_A=3.

right=2: sum_gaps_between=4+4=8. 8<=10. current_A=2+1+4=7. max_A=7.

right=3: sum_gaps_between=4+4+5=13>10.

So we need to move left forward. Subtract gaps[0] (4) → sum_gaps_between=9. still>10.

sum_gaps_between=9. left=1. sum_gaps_between= gaps[1] + gaps[2] =4+5=9<=10.

current_A=1+4+5's sum? Wait, no. The current window is left=1 to right=3 (segments 1,2,3). The sum of segments is 1 (seg1) +4 (seg2) +1 (seg3) → sum 6. So current_A=6. max_A remains 7.

right=4: sum_gaps_between=9 (from left=1) +4 (gap between 3 and4 is 4) → 9+4=13>10.

So subtract gaps[1]=4 → sum_gaps_between=13-4=9. left=2.

sum_gaps_between=5 (gap 2) +4 (gap3) →9. Which is <=10. sum of segments is 4 (seg2) +1 (seg3) +3 (seg4) →8. current_A=8. max_A=8.

Thus, the maximum A is8. So answer is 8+10=18. Which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Now, the third sample: one segment of length 999,999,999. gaps array is empty. sum_gaps_between is 0. So sum_gaps_between=0 <= h=1e9. So current_A=999,999,999. answer is 1e9+999,999,999=1,999,999,999.

Which is correct.

Another test case: segments [1,3] and [5,6], h=2.

gaps between them is 5-3=2.

prefix_gaps: [0,2].

sum_gaps_between for window 0-1 is 2 <=h=2.

sum of segments is 2+1=3. answer is 3+2=5.

Yes.

So the approach is correct.

Now, the code.

We need to:

- Read n and h.

- Read the segments, which are given in sorted order, non-overlapping.

- Compute the gaps between consecutive segments.

- Compute prefix sums for the segments' lengths.

- Compute the gaps array.

- Use a sliding window to find the maximum sum of segments' lengths where the sum of gaps between them in the window is <=h.

Implementing this.

But how to compute the gaps between segments:

for i in 0 to n-2:

   gaps[i] = x[i+1][0] - x[i][1]

prefix_gaps is a prefix sum array of the gaps.

But in code, the gaps array can be built as:

prev_segment = first segment.

then, for each next segment, compute the gap.

Then, the sliding window:

Initialize left=0, current_gaps=0, max_A=0.

for each right in 0 to n-1:

   if right >0:

       current_gaps += gaps[right-1]

   while current_gaps >h and left < right:

       current_gaps -= gaps[left]

       left +=1

   current_A = prefix_sum[right+1] - prefix_sum[left]

   max_A = max(max_A, current_A)

Then, answer is max_A +h.

So code:

Read n, h.

segments = [tuple of x1, x2 for each of n lines]

compute the gaps:

gaps = []

for i in range(n-1):

   next_x1 = segments[i+1][0]

   curr_x2 = segments[i][1]

   gaps.append(next_x1 - curr_x2)

compute prefix_sum for segments:

prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

   prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + (segments[i][1] - segments[i][0])

then, sliding window:

left =0

current_gaps=0

max_A=0

for right in range(n):

   if right >0:

       current_gaps += gaps[right-1]

   while current_gaps >h and left < right:

       current_gaps -= gaps[left]

       left +=1

   current_A = prefix_sum[right+1] - prefix_sum[left]

   if current_A > max_A:

       max_A = current_A

answer = max_A +h

print(answer)

Yes.
