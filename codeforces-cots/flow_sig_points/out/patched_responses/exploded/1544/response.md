Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we track contacts over days and answer queries about how many people are in the same connected component as a given person, considering only the last k days. Hmm. The challenge is to handle the dynamic nature of the contacts, where each day's contacts might expire after k days, but merging and splitting components efficiently is tricky.

First, the problem requires that when we process a query of type 2, we have to find the size of the connected component that the person is in, considering all contacts from the last k days. Each day, new contacts are added (type 1), and when days pass (type 3), the older contacts might expire.

So, the key here is that each contact has a time when it was added. But since the days can pass with type 3 queries, we need to track the current day, and whenever the day advances, any contacts older than k days are removed. Wait, but how are the contacts stored? Because each contact between x and y on day d would be active for k days, including day d. So, for example, if k is 2, and a contact is added on day 1, then on days 1, 2, 3: days 1 and 2 are within the incubation period. Wait, no. Because the problem says "last k days". So when the current day is T, the contacts from days T - k + 1 to T are considered. So each time the day increments (type 3), the window of relevant days shifts.

Wait, but when a type 3 query is processed, the current day increments by one. So, for example, if the initial day is 0, and we process a type 3 query, it becomes day 1, etc. So, the contacts are stored with their day, and whenever the day increases, we need to check if any contacts are now older than k days, and remove them.

But how do we manage the union-find structure when edges can expire? Because union-find (disjoint set union) structures are good for merging sets, but not for splitting. So if we have edges that are active for a certain period, handling their expiration is challenging.

This is a classic problem with dynamic connectivity, especially with time-based edges. One approach is to use a segment tree over time to track the intervals during which each edge is active. However, that might be complex, especially for handling the queries in the order they come.

Alternatively, considering that k is fixed, perhaps we can model the problem using a union-find structure that can roll back changes. This is the "rollback" or "persistent" DSU approach. The idea is that when edges are added, they are only active for a certain number of days, and when the day increments, old edges are removed. But with a fixed k, each edge added on day d is valid for days d, d+1, ..., d + k - 1. So when the current day T exceeds d + k -1, the edge is no longer active.

But handling this with a DSU that can rollback is tricky. Because when an edge is added, it's part of the DSU until it's removed. But since the edges can be added and removed over time, we need a way to track the state of the DSU at each day T. However, with the current day advancing via type 3 queries, which can be up to 1e5 times, this approach might not be feasible.

Wait, but the type 3 queries just increment the current day. So the current day is T, and after a type 3 query, it becomes T+1. So the edges added on day d are active for exactly k days. So, if k is 5, an edge added on day 3 would be active on days 3,4,5,6,7. Once the current day T becomes 8, the edge is no longer active.

So, the edges' active periods are [d, d + k -1]. So, when the current day T increases, any edges that were added on days <= T -k are now expired and need to be removed.

The problem is that when edges are removed, the DSU's structure can split, which is something DSU isn't designed for. So this complicates things.

An alternative approach is to model the DSU as a structure that can handle time-based edges. One possible way is to use a DSU with rollback, where each union operation is stored with a timestamp, and when querying, we can find the earliest timestamp such that the union is valid up to the current time T. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the edges are added in chronological order, and they expire after exactly k days. So when the current day is T, any edge added on a day <= T -k is now expired. So, for example, if T is 10, and k is 3, edges added on day 7 or earlier are expired.

So the problem requires that for each query of type 2, the connected components are determined by all edges added in the last k days (current day T, the edges added in T -k +1 to T days). Wait, no. Wait, when the current day is T, the edges that are active are those added in days >= T -k +1. Because the edges added on day d are active for exactly k days. For example, if k=2, and edge is added on day 1, then it's active on days 1 and 2. So if current day is 2, the edge is active. But if current day is 3, the edge is no longer active.

So when processing queries, the current day is T. Any edges added on day d where d > T -k are active. So d >= T -k +1 (since T -k +1 + (k-1) days is T). So the edges are active for k days, including the day they were added.

So, when the current day increases to T+1, the window of active edges shifts. Now, edges added in days >= (T+1) -k +1 = T -k +2 are active.

So, the problem requires that when processing queries, the edges that are considered are those added in the last k days, up to the current day.

The challenge is how to manage the DSU such that when the current day moves forward, the edges that have expired are removed, and the DSU structure is adjusted accordingly.

But since DSU is a structure that merges sets and cannot split them, this is not straightforward. So perhaps we need a different approach.

Alternative Idea: Since the edges are only active for exactly k days, perhaps we can model the DSU as a structure that tracks the current active edges. Each time the day advances, we need to remove all edges that were added exactly k days ago. Wait, no. Because when the current day is T, the edges added on days T -k +1 to T are active. So when T increases by 1, the edges added on day T -k +1 are now out of the window. So each day increment, the edges added on day (current T -k) are removed.

Wait, when day is T, active edges are those added on days >= (T -k +1). When the day increments by 1 to T+1, active edges are those added on days >= (T+1 -k +1) = T -k +2. So the edges that are now removed are those added on (T -k +1). So each time the day increments, we need to remove all edges added on (current_day -k) day.

Wait, that's a key insight. For example, current day is T. The active edges are those added on days T -k +1, T -k +2, ..., T. When the day increments to T+1, the active edges are days (T+1 -k +1) = T -k +2, up to T+1. So the only day that is no longer active is T -k +1. So, each time the day increases, the edges added exactly (current_day -k) days ago are removed.

So, if we can track, for each day, the edges added on that day, then when the day advances, we can process all edges added on day (current_day -k) and remove them. But how to remove edges from the DSU?

This is the crux of the problem. Because once edges are added and the DSU merges sets, removing an edge could split the set into two parts, but DSU doesn't support that.

This is a dynamic connectivity problem with deletions, which is difficult to handle efficiently.

Alternative Approach: Since we can't split the DSU, perhaps we can model the problem using a DSU that tracks the time when each union happened, and for each query, we check the current time and determine which unions are active. But this seems challenging.

Another Idea: Instead of trying to track the DSU as edges are added and removed, perhaps we can model the problem using a DSU that has all possible edges, but when processing a query, only considers the edges added in the last k days. But that's not feasible for large n and q.

Wait, but the queries are of type 2, which ask for the size of the connected component including the person, considering only the edges added in the last k days. So perhaps, for each query of type 2, we can build the connected component on the fly by considering the active edges. However, this is O(q * (n + m)), which would be too slow for q up to 5e5.

Alternative Idea: We can use a DSU with a time component, where each union is timestamped, and when checking the connectivity, we only consider unions that are active. This is similar to the offline dynamic connectivity problem. However, implementing this in Python for 5e5 queries may be challenging.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached using a DSU with rollbacks. Here's the idea: every edge added on day d is active for exactly k days. So, when the day is T, the edge is active if T is in [d, d +k -1]. So, each edge has a start and end day. The DSU needs to track all edges active at the current day T. As T increases, edges can expire.

But handling dynamic T with edges being added and removed is difficult. However, since the edges are added in chronological order (since the day can only advance via type 3 queries), we can process the expiration of edges in a batch when the day increments.

Let me think: Each time we process a type 3 query (day increments by 1), we need to remove all edges that were added (d) where d = current_day -k. Because current_day becomes T, and the edges added on T -k are now expired.

So the idea is:

- Maintain a list of edges for each day. For each day d, store all edges added on that day.

- The DSU structure represents the current active edges (all edges added in the last k days).

- When the day increments by 1 (type 3), we need to remove all edges added on (current_day -k) day, because they are now expired.

But how to remove edges from the DSU? Since DSU operations are union, which are not invertible. So, when you union two sets, you can't later split them. So, if an edge was added on day d and then removed, the DSU would not know how to split the merged set.

This seems like a problem. So, perhaps we need a way to track the DSU state for each possible day. But that's impossible for large k and n.

Alternative Idea: Use a link-cut data structure with time-based information. Each union operation is associated with a time interval. For a given query, the connectivity is determined by the unions active during the last k days. But this is probably too complex to implement, especially in Python.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of each edge as being active for exactly k days. So when an edge is added on day d, it is active for days d, d+1, ..., d +k -1. Then, the edges that are active at any time T are those added on days T -k +1 to T. So, the active edges are those added in the last k days.

So, when T increases by 1, the edges added on (T -k) are no longer active. So, each time T increments, we need to "undo" all the edges added on day (T -k).

If we can keep track of all the edges added each day, and when T increments, we can process the edges added on day (T -k) and "undo" their unions. But how to undo the unions?

This is where a DSU with rollback (persistent DSU) comes into play. The DSU supports union operations and can be rolled back to a previous state. Each time we process a day increment, we can roll back all the unions done on the edges added on (T -k) day. However, this requires that all operations can be reversed, which is possible if we track the parent and size changes during each union.

But how to manage this when multiple unions may have happened on different days?

Let me think. For each day d, when we add edges, we can record the operations (unions) that were performed. Then, when the day T becomes such that d = T -k, we need to roll back those unions. However, the order of unions matters. If multiple unions were done on day d, they might have merged several components. To undo them, we need to reverse the order of operations, which requires a stack-based approach.

A DSU with rollback can be implemented using a union-find structure that keeps track of the changes made during each union, allowing them to be rolled back in reverse order. This is typically done using a stack that records the previous parent and size of the roots involved in each union.

So the plan is:

- Use a DSU with rollback support.

- For each day d, when edges are added (type 1 queries), perform the union operations and record these operations in a list for day d.

- When the day T increases (type 3 queries), for each day d where d = T -k, we need to undo all the unions made on day d. For each union in that day's list, we roll back the DSU to before that union was performed.

- For type 2 queries, we simply query the size of the component containing the given node in the current DSU state.

This approach requires that the DSU can efficiently handle multiple unions and rollbacks in the correct order. Each time a day increments, we process the day that's falling out of the k-day window and roll back all the unions made on that day.

Now, considering the constraints:

- n can be up to 1e5, q up to 5e5.

- Each type 1 query adds an edge (so each day could have multiple edges).

- Each type 3 query increments the day and may require rolling back all edges added (k days ago).

The key is to handle the rollbacks efficiently. Let's think about the maximum possible number of rollback operations. For each day d, when T increases past d +k, we need to roll back all the unions made on day d. Each such rollback is O(1) per union, assuming the DSU's stack-based approach.

But the DSU with rollback has an O(alpha(n)) time per operation, but with path compression and union by size, the amortized time is acceptable.

So, how to structure this:

- The DSU will have a stack that records the operations (parent changes) made during each union. When a union is performed, the necessary parent and size changes are pushed onto the stack. When rolling back, we pop from the stack and restore the parent and size values.

But implementing this in Python may be challenging due to the stack's size and the overhead of function calls. However, given the problem's constraints, it's manageable.

So steps for the solution:

1. Maintain the current day T, starting at 0.

2. For each type 1 query (x, y), add this edge to the list of edges for the current day.

3. For each type 3 query, increment T and check if T >=k (since when T is less than k, there's nothing to expire). Then, the day that is now being expired is d = T -k. For all edges added on day d, we need to undo their unions. To do this, we process each edge added on day d, but in reverse order (since unions may have dependencies). Wait, no—each edge added on day d is processed by the DSU as a union. To undo them, we need to roll back each union in reverse order. Because if we have multiple unions in a day, their order affects the DSU state. However, the rollback must undo the unions in the reverse order of their application. So if during day d we have edges (A,B), (C,D), (B,C), then the unions would have been processed in that order, and the rollback must undo (B,C), then (C,D), then (A,B). So for each day's edges, we need to process them in reverse order when rolling back.

Wait, but how to track the order of unions? For each day d, we can keep a stack of the unions (the order in which they were processed). When rolling back, we process them in reverse order. So for each day d, we have a list of unions performed that day. When we need to roll back, we iterate through this list in reverse order and undo each union.

But how to track which unions are part of which day? For each day d, we can have a list of checkpoints in the DSU's stack. For example, for day d, after processing all unions for that day, we can note how many operations are in the DSU's stack. Then, when rolling back, we can pop operations until we reach that checkpoint. Alternatively, for each day d, when we add edges, for each union, we push the operation to the stack, and also track the number of operations added each day.

This way, when rolling back day d, we know how many operations were performed for that day and can undo them by popping that many times from the stack.

This approach would work. Let's formalize it:

- For each day d, when processing type 1 queries (edges added), for each edge (x,y), perform the union in the DSU and record the number of operations added for that day. For example, each union may involve multiple parent changes (due to path compression), but the DSU's stack-based rollback would track each individual change.

Wait, but the DSU's stack-based approach might track each individual parent change. So, when a union is performed, the DSU may perform path compressions, which modify multiple nodes' parents. So, each union could result in multiple entries in the stack. Therefore, when we undo a union, we need to revert all those changes. But this complicates tracking the number of operations per day.

Alternatively, for each union operation (x,y) in day d, we can wrap the entire union process, and track how many stack entries are created during that union. Then, when rolling back, we can revert all those entries. But this could be difficult.

Alternatively, the DSU's rollback stack can be a list of (old_parent, current_node) entries. Each time a node's parent is changed, the entry is pushed to the stack. Then, when rolling back, we pop entries and restore the parent of current_node to old_parent.

In this model, when we perform a union, it may result in a certain number of stack entries. For example, during the find operation with path compression, each time a node's parent is updated, an entry is pushed to the stack.

So, to track how many stack entries are added for a particular union, we could:

- Before processing a union, note the current stack length.

- Perform the union, which may add some entries to the stack.

- After the union, calculate how many entries were added (new length - old length) and store this count for the current day.

Then, when rolling back a day's unions, for each union in reverse order, we pop the corresponding number of stack entries.

But this would require storing, for each day d, a list of counts of stack entries per union. For example, if day d has three unions, each adding 2, 3, and 1 stack entries, respectively, then when rolling back, we process the unions in reverse order and for each, pop 1, then 3, then 2 entries.

This approach allows us to properly roll back the unions in reverse order, restoring the DSU to its prior state.

But how to implement this in Python?

We can structure it as follows:

- The DSU has a parent array and a size array.

- The stack is a list of tuples representing the state changes. Each entry is (node, previous_parent).

- For each day d, we maintain a list called 'day_ops' which tracks the number of stack entries added for each union operation in that day.

- When processing a type 1 query (x, y), before performing the union, we record the current stack length (prev_len), then perform the union, which may add entries to the stack. We then compute the number of entries added (new_len - prev_len) and append this to the current day's 'day_ops' list.

- When rolling back the unions of day d, we iterate over the 'day_ops' list in reverse order. For each count in reverse order, we pop 'count' entries from the stack, and restore the parent and size arrays.

Wait, but how to restore the size? Because when you perform a union, you may have changed the size of the root. So during the union, you might have code like:

root_x = find(x)
root_y = find(y)
if root_x == root_y: return
if size[root_x] < size[root_y]:
    parent[root_x] = root_y
    size[root_y] += size[root_x]
else:
    parent[root_y] = root_x
    size[root_x] += size[root_y]

So, when undoing this, you need to reset the parent and the size. But in the stack entries, we stored only the parent changes, not the size changes. Hmm, this is a problem. So to properly roll back, the stack must track both the parent and size changes.

So, perhaps each stack entry should be a tuple of (node, old_parent, old_size, was_root). But this complicates the stack structure. Alternatively, for each operation that changes the parent of a node, we need to record the previous parent and the previous size. For example, when a node's parent is changed, if it was a root, then its size would have been part of the union. So, in the stack, we need to track:

For each node whose parent is changed during path compression, we need to track the old parent and the old size of the root(s) involved in the union.

This is getting complicated. But to properly roll back, the DSU must be able to undo all changes made during a union, including path compressions and size updates.

An alternative approach is to use a DSU without path compression and without union by size, but that would make the time complexity worse. So, perhaps it's better to use a DSU with union by rank and path compression, and track all the changes made during each find and union to enable proper rollback.

This requires that each time the parent of a node is changed (either during path compression or during a union), that change is recorded in the stack. Then, when rolling back, the parent is restored, and the size of the root nodes is also restored.

But how to track the size changes. For example, during a union, when you merge two roots, the size of the new root is updated. So, when rolling back this union, you need to restore the size of both roots. So, for the union operation, the stack must track the previous size of the roots.

Let me think. For each union between x and y:

- Find the roots of x and y.

- If they are the same, no action.

- Otherwise, merge the smaller into the larger.

So, during the union, the parent of one root is set to the other, and the size of the new root is increased.

So, the changes that need to be recorded are:

1. The parent of the root that was changed (say, root_y's parent is set to root_x).

2. The size of the root that absorbed the other (root_x's size is increased by root_y's size).

So, during the union, these two changes are made. To undo this, we need to:

a. Restore the parent of root_y to itself.

b. Restore the size of root_x to its original value before the union.

So, the stack entry for a union would need to store:

- The node whose parent was changed (root_y) and its previous parent (root_y).

- The root whose size was changed (root_x) and its previous size (original size).

Wait, but during the union, root_y's parent is changed to root_x, and root_x's size is increased by root_y's size.

So, the stack entry for the union would be a tuple indicating:

- root_y's old parent (root_y).

- root_x's old size (size[root_x] - size[root_y]).

But wait, after the union, root_x's size becomes size[root_x] + size[root_y]. So, when undoing, we subtract size[root_y] from size[root_x].

But how do we track that? So, during the union, the stack entries would be:

For the parent change of root_y: (root_y, root_x, 'parent'), and for the size change of root_x: (root_x, size_before, 'size').

But this may require multiple entries for a single union.

Alternatively, we can represent the union's effect as two operations: changing the parent of root_y and changing the size of root_x. So, when we perform a union, we first record the previous parent of root_y (which was root_y itself, since it was a root) and the previous size of root_x. Then, during rollback, we restore these two values.

Thus, for each union, the stack would have two entries: one for the parent change of root_y, and one for the size change of root_x.

In addition, during path compression (in the find function), each time a node's parent is updated, that change is also pushed to the stack. For example, during find(x), when we set x's parent to its grandparent, we need to record the previous parent of x so that it can be restored during rollback.

So, the stack will have entries for all parent changes made during find and union operations. But this can be a lot, but it's necessary for accurate rollbacks.

So, in code:

The DSU's find function would be implemented with path compression, but each time a node's parent is updated, the previous parent is pushed to the stack. The union operation would push the parent change of the merged root and the size change of the absorbing root.

Then, when rolling back, for each entry in the stack (in reverse order), we restore the parent or size.

But in Python, how to implement this efficiently?

The DSU can be represented with:

- parent: list where parent[i] is the parent of node i.

- size: list where size[i] is the size of the tree rooted at i.

- stack: list of tuples indicating the type of change.

Each entry in the stack can be of the form:

('parent', node, previous_parent)

or

('size', node, previous_size)

So, during a find operation with path compression:

def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        prev_parent = parent[x]
        root = find(parent[x])
        if parent[x] != root:
            # This is a path compression step. Record the change.
            stack.append( ('parent', x, prev_parent) )
            parent[x] = root
        return root
    return x

Wait, but in the find function, path compression can change the parent of x and possibly other nodes along the path. So, for each node whose parent is changed during path compression, we need to record the previous parent.

So, during find, every time we change a node's parent (during path compression), we push an entry to the stack.

Then, during a union:

x_root = find(x)
y_root = find(y)
if x_root == y_root:
    return
if size[x_root] < size[y_root]:
    x_root, y_root = y_root, x_root
# Merge y_root into x_root
stack.append( ('parent', y_root, y_root) )  # previous parent of y_root was y_root
parent[y_root] = x_root
stack.append( ('size', x_root, size[x_root] ) )
size[x_root] += size[y_root]

This way, when rolling back, each entry in the stack can be processed. For example, when we encounter a 'parent' entry (node, prev_parent), we set parent[node] = prev_parent. For a 'size' entry (node, prev_size), we set size[node] = prev_size.

Now, for each union, the find operations may add path compression entries to the stack. So, when the union is rolled back, all these entries need to be processed in reverse order.

But this approach could be very memory-intensive, as every path compression step adds an entry to the stack. For large n and q, this could be a problem. However, given the problem constraints (q up to 5e5), and the fact that each query may generate O(alpha(n)) entries in the stack, this may be manageable.

But how to track the entries for each day. For example, when processing a type 3 query, we need to roll back all unions added on day d = T -k. Each of these unions may have multiple entries in the stack (from path compressions and the actual union steps).

So, for each day d, when we process the unions (type 1 queries), we can record the number of entries added to the stack during each union. Then, when rolling back, for each union in the day's list in reverse order, we pop the corresponding number of entries and process them in reverse.

But how to track the number of entries per union per day.

Alternatively, for each day d, we can record the start and end indices of the stack entries that belong to that day. Then, when rolling back day d, we process all stack entries from end to start, restoring the state.

But this requires that we track for each day d the range of stack indices that were added during that day. However, days are processed in order, and when a day is rolled back, all stack entries added on that day are removed.

Wait, but when the day advances, and we process a type 3 query, which increments T, the current day becomes T+1. The edges added on day (T+1 -k) are now expired. So, for each type 3 query, we need to process the day d = T (before increment) -k +1 ?

No, let me think again. Let's say current day is T. After processing a type 3 query, T becomes T+1. The day that is now expired is (T+1 -k) = T -k +1. So, for example, if k=3 and T was 5, after incrementing to 6, the expired day is 6-3=3. So, the edges added on day 3 are now expired.

So, when processing a type 3 query, we need to process all edges added on day d = (T after increment) -k. Because after incrementing T to T+1, the expired day is (T+1) -k.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to track T as the current day. Initially, T starts at 0. Each type 3 query increases T by 1. The active edges are those added on days >= (T -k +1). So, any edges added on days <= (T -k) are expired.

So, when T increases by 1, the new T is T_new = T_old +1. The edges added on day d = T_old +1 -k are now expired.

So, whenever T increases, the edges added on day d = (current T after increment) -k are expired.

Thus, each time we process a type 3 query (which increments T by 1), we need to process the day d = T -k (since T is now the new value). For example:

Initial T is 0. After increment, T is 1. If k=2, then d=1-2= -1. No days to process.

After T increases to 3 and k=2, d=3-2=1. So day 1 is now expired.

Thus, in code:

for each type 3 query:

    T += 1

    d = T -k

    if d >=0:

        process all edges added on day d, rolling back their unions.

But how to track which stack entries belong to day d.

This is where the problem becomes tricky. Because each day's unions contribute to the stack. So, for each day d, we need to track the number of stack entries added during that day. Or, more precisely, for each day d, we can track the number of operations (unions) and for each union, the number of stack entries it added.

But how to structure this.

Perhaps for each day d, we can maintain a list that records the number of stack entries added during each union operation on that day. So, for example, if day d has three unions, and each added 5, 3, and 2 stack entries respectively, then for that day, the list would be [5,3,2]. When rolling back, we process the list in reverse order (2,3,5) and pop those entries from the stack.

But how to track the number of stack entries per union.

Each time we process a type 1 query (adding an edge x, y):

- We perform a find on x and y, which may add stack entries due to path compression.

- Then, if the roots are different, we perform a union, which adds more stack entries.

So, for each type 1 query, we need to track how many stack entries were added during this entire process (find x, find y, and possibly union).

But this seems complicated. Because each find can generate multiple stack entries.

Alternatively, for each type 1 query (edge x,y), we can:

- Record the current stack length as start_len.

- Perform the union of x and y.

- Record the current stack length as end_len.

- The difference (end_len - start_len) is the number of stack entries added for this union. This number is appended to the current day's list of operations.

Then, when we need to roll back the unions of day d, we iterate through the list of operations for that day in reverse order, and for each operation, pop (end_len - start_len) entries from the stack, restoring the DSU.

This approach would work, but how to implement it.

In code:

For each day d, we have a list called 'day_ops' which stores the number of stack entries added for each type 1 query processed on that day.

When processing a type 1 query:

- start_len = len(stack)

- process the union of x and y (which includes find and possible union steps)

- end_len = len(stack)

- delta = end_len - start_len

- append delta to the current day's 'day_ops' list.

Then, when rolling back day d:

- for delta in reversed(day_ops[d]):

    for _ in range(delta):

        entry = stack.pop()

        if entry is 'parent' type:

            parent[entry.node] = entry.old_parent

        elif entry is 'size' type:

            size[entry.node] = entry.old_size

But how to manage this efficiently.

In Python, popping from a list is O(1), but doing this for each delta in reverse order would take O(delta) time per entry. For example, if a day has m unions, each with delta entries, the total time is O(m*delta). For large m and delta, this could be slow.

But given the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable. Let's consider that each union can generate O(alpha(n)) entries due to path compression and the union itself. For 5e5 queries, the total stack entries could be up to O(5e5 * alpha(n)) which is manageable.

But given the time constraints (5 seconds per test case), this approach might work.

So, the steps are:

- Initialize the DSU with parent[i] = i and size[i] = 1.

- Initialize a dictionary (or list) to track for each day d, the list of 'delta' values (number of stack entries added per union).

- Track the current day T, initially 0.

- For each query:

    if type 1:

        x and y are given.

        start_len = len(stack)

        perform the find and possible union.

        end_len = len(stack)

        delta = end_len - start_len

        append delta to the current day's list (day_ops[T]).

    elif type 2:

        z is given.

        find the root of z.

        output the size of the root.

    elif type 3:

        T += 1

        d = T -k

        if d >=0:

            for each delta in reversed(day_ops[d]):

                for _ in range(delta):

                    entry = stack.pop()

                    if entry[0] == 'parent':

                        node, prev_parent = entry[1], entry[2]

                        parent[node] = prev_parent

                    elif entry[0] == 'size':

                        node, prev_size = entry[1], entry[2]

                        size[node] = prev_size

            day_ops[d].clear()  # to save memory, but not necessary.

But wait, the day_ops[d] could be stored in a list where the index is the day. For example, a list called 'day_ops_list', where day_ops_list[d] is the list of deltas for day d.

But since the day can be up to T = q (since each type 3 query increments T by 1), and q can be up to 5e5, the day_ops_list needs to be a list of 5e5+ elements, each possibly empty. But in Python, lists can't be pre-allocated to 5e5+ elements, but we can use a dictionary to store the day_ops for each day. However, for efficiency, perhaps a defaultdict(list) is better.

But let's think about the maximum possible day. Each type 3 query increases T by 1. The maximum number of type 3 queries is up to q (if all queries are type 3). So T can be up to q. But q is 5e5, so the day can be up to 5e5. So using a list of size O(q) is possible, but in Python, list indices start at 0, and days start at 0, so it's manageable.

But for days up to 5e5, initializing a list of size 5e5+1 is possible, but may take up memory. However, since each day starts with no operations, using a defaultdict(list) is more memory-efficient.

Alternatively, during processing, for each day d, if a type 1 query occurs, the current day is T, and we append to day_ops[T], which is a list. If no type 1 queries are made on a day, then day_ops[T] is empty.

So, in code:

We can use a list of lists called day_ops, where day_ops[d] contains the list of deltas for day d. Initially, we can use a defaultdict(list) to handle days dynamically.

But in Python, the standard way is to use a list, and for days up to T_max, we can append empty lists as needed.

But given that the day T can increase up to 5e5, we need to initialize a list that can grow up to that size.

Alternatively, since the day starts at 0 and increments by 1 each type 3 query, but type 1 queries are processed for the current day T (before any type 3 queries).

Wait, the day_ops are tracked for the current day T when type 1 queries are processed. For example, when processing a type 1 query, the edge is added to the current day T (before any type 3 queries have been processed). So, when multiple type 3 queries are processed, the current day T increases, and type 1 queries are added to the new current day.

So, for example:

- Initially, T=0.

- Process a type 1 query: added to day_ops[0].

- Process a type 3 query: T becomes 1.

- Process a type 1 query: added to day_ops[1].

Thus, the day_ops list needs to be indexed by the day d. So, for each day d, we need to track the deltas of the unions processed on that day.

So, in Python, we can use a list where the index is the day d, and each entry is a list of deltas. We can initialize this list with empty lists for days up to a certain point, but since days can be up to 5e5, we need to dynamically manage this.

But in Python, appending to a list with indexes up to 5e5 is possible. Alternatively, we can use a dictionary where the key is the day d, and the value is the list of deltas. However, checking for the existence of a day and appending is easier with a dictionary.

So, code structure:

from collections import defaultdict

parent = list(range(n+1))  # 1-based indexing
size = [1]*(n+1)
stack = []

    type_q = query[0]
    if type_q == '1':
        x = int(query[1])
        y = int(query[2])

        # Need to implement find with stack tracking
        def find(u):

                pu = parent[u]
                stack.append(('parent', u, pu))
                parent[u] = parent[pu]
                u = pu
            return u
        # So find function may modify parent during path compression and push to stack
        # But the code for find in Python can't have a recursive function here. So, iterative find is needed.
        # Alternative approach for iterative find with path compression and stack tracking.
        # Let's implement find as a loop that traces the path and compresses.

            parent[py] = px

            size[px] += size[py]
        end_len = len(stack)
        delta = end_len - start_len

    elif type_q == '2':
        z = int(query[1])
        # Find root of z
        # Need to find without path compression, or use path compression but track it (but for query, path compression would affect future operations)
        # However, since queries don't modify the DSU, we can perform find with path compression but not track the changes (since during rollback, these changes are not recorded). Wait, but during a query, the find function could perform path compression which would modify the parent array. However, these changes are not recorded in the stack. So when a rollback happens, these changes would not be undone. This is a problem.

        # This is a major issue. Because during a query (type 2), if we perform find with path compression, it modifies the parent array. But these changes are not tracked in the stack, so when we roll back, these changes are not undone, leading to an incorrect state.

        # So, we need to avoid modifying the parent array during a type 2 query. Thus, for type 2 queries, we need to perform find without path compression, or find in a way that does not modify the parent array.

        # How to implement this?

        # For type 2 queries, we can find the root by following the parent pointers without modifying anything. This is necessary to avoid changing the DSU state.

        # So, find without path compression.

                        elif entry[0] == 'size':
                            node, prev_size = entry[1], entry[2]
                            size[node] = prev_size
                # Remove the day from day_ops to free memory
                del day_ops[d]

But wait, this code has several issues:

1. The find function used during type 1 queries is implemented in a way that may not track all path compressions. The code provided for find in the type 1 query is not correct. Because the current find implementation is not properly tracking all path compression steps. For example, the code for find x's root:

        # Find x's root
        px = x
        path = []
        while parent[px] != px:
            path.append(px)
            px = parent[px]
        for node in path:
            stack.append(('parent', node, parent[node]))
            parent[node] = px

This code compresses the path from x to px. For each node in the path, the parent is set to px, and these changes are recorded in the stack. This is correct. So, this code will generate the necessary stack entries for path compression.

2. During type 2 queries, the find_root function does not perform path compression. This is correct, as the parent array should not be modified during a type 2 query. Hence, the find_root function is a simple loop that follows the parent pointers without changing anything.

3. During rollback (type 3 queries), the code iterates through the day_ops[d] in reverse order and pops delta entries from the stack for each delta in the list. This is correct, as each delta represents the number of stack entries added during that union. Reversing the order ensures that the unions are undone in reverse order.

However, the code uses a defaultdict for day_ops, and when a day is rolled back, the entries are processed and then deleted. This should be correct.

Now, what about the time and space complexity?

Each type 1 query involves two find operations and possibly a union. Each find can generate O(alpha(n)) stack entries due to path compression. The union can generate a fixed number of entries (the parent change and size change). So each type 1 query generates O(alpha(n)) stack entries. For 5e5 type 1 queries, this is O(5e5 * alpha(n)) stack entries, which is manageable.

Each type 3 query processes O(m) stack entries, where m is the number of stack entries added on day d. This can be up to O(5e5 * alpha(n)) in total, but averaged over all queries, it's acceptable.

The space used by the stack is O(total stack entries), which is O(q * alpha(n)). For Python, this could be a problem if the stack entries are too many, but given the time constraints of 5 seconds and the problem's limits, it might work.

But in Python, popping elements from a list is O(1), and for each stack entry, we just restore the parent or size. This should be efficient enough.

Another potential issue is the find_root function for type 2 queries. Since it doesn't perform path compression, the find operation could take O(n) time in the worst case, leading to O(qn) time, which is not acceptable for large n and q.

For example, if there are many type 2 queries after a long chain of unions, each query could take O(n) time. This would be too slow.

This is a major problem. So, the find_root function for type 2 queries must be efficient. However, the path compression during type 1 queries and the rollbacks during type 3 queries would have optimized the parent pointers, but during type 2 queries, without path compression, the parent pointers might be out of date.

For example, if during type 1 queries, path compression is done and the parents are updated, but then a rollback happens, the parent pointers are restored. However, during type 2 queries, the find_root function would follow the parent pointers as they are in the current DSU state.

But even with that, the find_root function may take O(log n) time per query on average due to path compression done during type 1 queries.

But how to optimize the find_root function for type 2 queries.

An alternative is to allow path compression during type 2 queries, but this would modify the parent array, and those changes would not be tracked in the stack, leading to incorrect rollbacks. This is not acceptable.

So, the find_root function must not modify the parent array, which means it can't perform path compression. This can lead to worst-case O(n) time for each type 2 query, which is not acceptable.

This is a critical issue. How can we handle this?

Possible Solution: Use a different approach to find the root during type 2 queries. For example, during type 1 and type 3 queries, the DSU is maintained with path compression, but during type 2 queries, we use a different find function that uses memoization or some other technique to find the root quickly.

But memoization is not feasible because the DSU state can change over time.

Another Idea: Use a binary lifting table for each node to quickly find the root. But this would require O(n log n) memory and O(log n) time per query. However, maintaining such a structure is not possible because the parent pointers are dynamic and can change with unions and rollbacks.

Alternative Idea: Accept that the find_root function for type 2 queries can be slow. But given that type 2 queries are up to 5e5, each with O(log n) steps, this may be manageable.

But in the worst case, for a chain, each find_root could take O(n) time, which is 5e5 * 1e5 = 5e10 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. We need a better way.

Alternative Approach: Use a DSU with no path compression during unions, but that makes find operations O(log n) time. But this would also affect the time for unions.

But if the DSU uses union by size (or rank) without path compression, then the find operation takes O(log n) time per query, which for 5e5 queries would be O(5e5 * log n) operations, which is manageable.

But in this case, during type 1 queries, the find function would take O(log n) time, and the path compression steps would not be done, leading to a tree structure that is not flattened. But during type 2 queries, the find_root function would also take O(log n) time, which is acceptable.

But wait, this approach would avoid path compression, so the find function during type 1 queries would take O(log n) time per find. Unions would be O(log n) time. And type 2 queries would take O(log n) time.

This could be acceptable if log n is manageable. For n=1e5, log n is around 17, which is acceptable.

But how does this affect the rollback process?

If the DSU doesn't use path compression, then the parent pointers remain as they were during the unions. So, when a union is rolled back, the parent pointers are restored to their previous state. This would work.

Thus, the solution is to avoid path compression in the DSU. This way, during type 2 queries, the find_root function can be implemented with O(log n) time by following the parent pointers.

So, modifying the DSU to use union by size without path compression:

In the type 1 query's find function, we don't perform path compression. Thus, the parent pointers are not modified during find, and the find function simply returns the root.

Thus, during a union:

x_root = find(x)
y_root = find(y)
if x_root == y_root:
    return
if size[x_root] < size[y_root]:
    x_root, y_root = y_root, x_root
parent[y_root] = x_root
size[x_root] += size[y_root]

And the find function is:

def find(u):
    while parent[u] != u:
        u = parent[u]
    return u

But this find function can take O(log n) time per find.

But during type 1 queries, each union involves two finds (O(log n) time each) and a possible union (O(1) time). Thus, each type 1 query is O(log n) time.

Type 2 queries are O(log n) time as well.

Type 3 queries involve rolling back a day's unions. For each union in that day, we need to undo the parent and size changes. Each union in the day is stored as two stack entries: the parent change of y_root and the size change of x_root.

So, for each union in a day, when rolling back, we can restore the parent of y_root to its previous value (y_root), and restore the size of x_root to its previous value (size[x_root] - size[y_root]).

But this approach requires that the stack entries are correctly stored for each union.

Thus, the DSU without path compression would have a much simpler rollback process, as the stack entries per union are only two: the parent change and the size change.

This significantly reduces the number of stack entries and makes the rollback process manageable.

Let's rework the code with this approach:

Implement the DSU without path compression. For each union, record the parent and size changes in the stack. During type 3 queries, when rolling back a day's unions, process the stack entries for that day's unions in reverse order.

Thus, the code would look like:

Got: '4\n1\n4\n4\n1'

```

Thus, the final Python code is as follows.
