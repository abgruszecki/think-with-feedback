Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimal possible difference between the maximum and minimum fret indices used when playing a sequence of notes. Each note can be played on any of the 6 strings, and the fret for a string i and note b_j is (b_j - a_i). So for each note in the melody, there are 6 possible fret options (assuming that all a_i are such that b_j > a_i, which the problem states is true).

The goal is to assign one of these options to each note such that the difference between the largest and smallest frets used across all notes is minimized. Hmm.

So the approach here should be to consider all possible fret options for each note, and select one per note such that the range (max - min) is as small as possible.

But with n up to 1e5, trying all possible combinations is impossible. We need a smarter approach.

Let's think about possible fret values. For each note, we have up to 6 possible frets (some could be duplicates if different strings give the same value for a note). So for each note j, collect all possible (b_j - a_i) for i in 0..5. Then, the problem becomes selecting one value from each note's list such that the overall max and min in the selected values is minimized.

This sounds similar to the problem where we have to select a number from each list (each list corresponds to a note's possible frets) such that the range is as small as possible.

So, how can we approach this?

A possible approach is to collect all possible fret values, sort them, and then use a sliding window to find the smallest window where each list (note's possible frets) has at least one element in the window. The size of the window would be the current max - min. The minimal such window is the answer.

But how to efficiently check that all lists have at least one element in the current window?

Wait, each note's possible frets are a list. So for example, note 1 has fret options [x1, x2, x3, ...], note 2 has [y1, y2, ...], etc. For each note, we need to pick at least one of its fret options that is within the window [min_val, max_val]. So the problem reduces to finding a window where all n notes have at least one fret in that window, and the window's size (max - min) is minimized.

But this is the classic problem of finding the minimal range that covers at least one element from each of the n lists. However, the classic problem's solution is O(k * log k) where k is the total number of elements across all lists. Here, each note can have up to 6 elements, so k = 6 * 1e5 = 6e5, which is manageable.

Wait, in the classic problem, each list is sorted, and we need to pick one element from each list such that the range is minimized. The approach involves a min-heap and tracking the current maximum. But the problem here is that each note's list can have 6 elements. So perhaps we can model this as the classic problem.

Wait, but in our case, each note is a list of possible frets (sorted), and we need to choose one from each list such that the range (max - min) is minimized.

Yes, this is exactly the problem known as the "smallest range covering elements from each list" problem, which is a known hard problem. The optimal solution for that problem is O(k), where k is the total number of elements, using a heap-based approach.

In the original problem, the solution works as follows:

1. Insert the first element of each list into a min-heap. Keep track of the current maximum of these elements. The initial range is current_max - current_min.

2. Extract the minimum element from the heap. Then, insert the next element from the same list (if any). If there's no next element, the process stops. Update the current_max (if the new element is larger) and check if the new range is smaller than the current minimum. Repeat until one of the lists is exhausted.

But in our case, each list is for a note, and each list has 6 elements. So for each note, we need to have at least one of its elements included in the current window.

So the approach would be:

- Collect all possible frets for each note, sort each of their lists (though the problem allows for any order, but sorting each list might help in processing).

But wait, each note's possible frets are (b_j - a_i) for each of the 6 a_i. So for each note, compute all 6 possible frets, then sort them. Then, each list is sorted in ascending order.

Once all lists are sorted, the problem reduces to the classic smallest range problem.

So the solution is to model this as the classic problem and apply the heap-based approach.

But let's think about the constraints. For n=1e5, each list has 6 elements. So the total number of elements is 6e5. The heap approach for the classic problem would process O(k) elements, where k is 6e5. Each step involves a heap operation (O(log n)), but n here is 1e5. Wait, no. Wait, the heap in the classic problem has one element per list. Because the approach is that for each step, you have a pointer in each list, and you take the current element from each list, track the min and max. But wait, no. The heap-based approach for the classic problem works by keeping track of one element from each list, and the current maximum is tracked. The heap is a min-heap. Let's see:

In the classic problem:

- Each of the k lists is sorted.

- For each list, we take the first element and push it into the heap. The current maximum is the maximum of these elements.

- The initial range is max - min (the min is the top of the heap).

- Then, you pop the min element from the heap. Then, from the list that this element came from, you take the next element and push it into the heap. Update the current max if necessary.

- Each time you check if the new range (current max - new min) is smaller than the previous minimum range.

- The process stops when you can't take the next element from a list (i.e., one list is exhausted).

In this approach, the number of operations is O(k * m), where m is the average number of elements per list. But in our case, each list has 6 elements, but n is 1e5 lists. So for each list, you can have up to 6 elements, but the number of lists is n=1e5.

So the heap would have n elements (one from each list) at the start. But n is 1e5. Inserting 1e5 elements into a heap would take O(n log n) time, which is 1e5 log 1e5 ≈ 1e5 * 17 ≈ 1.7e6 operations. Then, each step involves popping and pushing into the heap. But each list has 6 elements, so each list can be advanced 5 times. So the total number of steps is O(n * 6) = 6e5 steps, each step involving O(log n) operations. So 6e5 * log (1e5) ≈ 6e5 * 17 ≈ 1e7 operations, which should be manageable within 2 seconds.

Wait, but for each of the 6e5 elements, how many times do we process them? Let me think again. The initial step is to pick the first element from each list, which is the smallest element in each list. Then, we track the current maximum. The range is current_max - min (the min is the top of the heap). Then, we pop the min, and advance that list to the next element. If the list has more elements, we push the next element into the heap, and update the current max if needed. So, for each list, we process all 6 elements. So total steps is the sum of the lengths of all lists. But each list has 6 elements, so sum is 6e5. So the total steps are 6e5. Each step involves a heap push and pop. So the time complexity is O(k log m), where m is the number of lists (n). Because each insertion into the heap is O(log m), since the heap has m elements (one per list). Wait, the heap can have up to m elements at any time (since each list is being processed in order, and for each list, we have a pointer to the current element). So for each list, the pointer can move from 0 to 5 (6 elements). So for each of the 6e5 elements, the heap operation is O(log m), where m is the number of lists (n=1e5). So 6e5 * log(1e5) ≈ 6e5 * 17 ≈ 1e7 operations, which is acceptable.

So this approach should work.

But how to model the data structures here?

First, for each note, generate all possible frets (b_j - a_i for each i in 0-5). Then sort each list. Then, for each list (note), we have a sorted array of possible frets.

Then, for all lists, we need to track the current index in each list. We start with index 0 for all lists. The initial elements are the first elements of each list. The heap will store tuples of (value, list_index, current_index_in_list). The current_max is the maximum of all initial elements.

Then, the minimal range is current_max - min_element (which is the top of the heap).

At each step:

- Extract the minimum element from the heap. This gives the list (note) index, and the current index in that list.

- Check if there are more elements in the list. If so, increment the index, and add the next element to the heap. Update the current_max if this new element is larger than the previous current_max.

- Compute the new range (current_max - new heap top), and see if it's smaller than the minimal range found so far.

- Repeat until one of the lists can't provide more elements (i.e., we've processed all elements in any list). Because once a list is exhausted (all elements have been processed), we can't proceed further, as we need at least one element from each list.

Wait, but in the problem, we must select exactly one element from each list. So once any list has all elements processed (i.e., when the current index reaches the end of the list), there's no way to select an element from that list. Therefore, when we reach that point, we can stop.

So the algorithm stops when any list has no more elements to process.

So the steps are:

1. For each note, collect all possible (b_j - a_i) for each string i. Sort each of these lists.

2. Initialize a pointer for each list starting at 0.

3. Create a min-heap, and for each list, push the first element (smallest in the list). Track the current maximum of all these elements.

4. The initial minimal range is current_max - heap's top element.

5. While True:

   a. Extract the minimum element from the heap. This gives the list index and the position in that list.

   b. If this list has more elements (current pointer +1 < len(list)), then move the pointer to the next element, push the new element into the heap, and update the current_max if needed.

   c. Else, break the loop (since this list can't provide more elements, and once we process the current step, we can't proceed further).

   d. Check if the new range (current_max - new heap top) is smaller than the current minimal range. Update if so.

6. Return the minimal range found.

Wait, but the initial step and the processing steps need to track which lists are contributing elements. Wait, no. Because each list must have at least one element in the window. So, the heap must have exactly one element from each list. But in the algorithm, when you extract the min element from a list, you replace it with the next element from the same list. So the heap always contains exactly one element from each list (as long as there are elements left in the list). So the window is formed by all the elements in the heap, which are one per list. The current_max is the maximum of these elements, and the current_min is the top of the heap.

So the algorithm is correct as long as each list is not exhausted. Once any list is exhausted (i.e., all elements have been considered), the algorithm stops. But why?

Because once you can't select a next element from a list, you can't form a valid window anymore. Because when you pop the current element of that list, you can't replace it with the next element (since there is none), so the heap would be missing that list's element, hence the window would no longer include that list, making it invalid. Therefore, the algorithm must stop when any list is exhausted.

But in our problem, each note's list has 6 elements. So when processing a list, after processing the 6th element (index 5), you can't advance further. So after that, when you extract the element from that list, you can't replace it, so the algorithm stops.

Wait, but in the algorithm, when you process the last element (the 6th) of a list, you can still proceed. Let me see:

For example, a list has elements [x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]. The pointers start at 0. The first element is x0. Then when x0 is popped, we replace it with x1, then x2, and so on until x5 is pushed. Then, when x5 is popped, we check if there's a next element. Since x5 is the last (index 5, and the list has 6 elements, len=6), there's no next element, so we can't push anything. At that point, the algorithm breaks.

So the process would process all 6 elements of each list. Wait, no. Because each time you pop an element from a list, you advance that list's pointer by 1, and push the next element. So, for a list with 6 elements, the pointers go from 0 to 5. When you push the 5th element (index 5), that's the last. Then, when you pop that element (index 5), you check if there's a next element (index 6, which is beyond the list's length). So you can't proceed, and the algorithm stops.

Thus, the algorithm processes all possible elements, but only as long as all lists can contribute. Wait, no. Because even if one list is exhausted (all elements processed), the algorithm stops. So in the case where some lists have more elements, but one list is exhausted, the algorithm stops.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Suppose we have two lists:

List1: [1,2,3]

List2: [4,5,6,7]

At the start, heap contains 1 and 4. Current max is 4. The initial range is 4-1=3.

We pop 1 (from List1). Then, since List1 has next element (2), push 2. Current max becomes max(4,2)=4. The new range is 4-2=2.

Then, the heap contains 2 and 4. Pop 2. Next element in List1 is 3. Push 3. Current max is max(4,3)=4. New range is 4-3=1.

Then, heap contains 3 and 4. Pop 3. List1 has no more elements (since it's at index 2, next is 3 which is out of bounds). So we can't push anything. The algorithm breaks. So the minimal range is 1.

But what if List2 had more elements? Like:

List1 has 3 elements. List2 has 5 elements.

After processing List1's elements, List1 can't contribute more, so the algorithm stops. But the algorithm would not consider the later elements of List2. But that's because once List1 is exhausted (all elements processed), the algorithm can't proceed, as any further step would require selecting a new element from List1, which isn't possible. So the algorithm correctly stops.

In our problem, since all lists have 6 elements, the algorithm will process until one list is exhausted. But when would a list be exhausted?

Each list starts with index 0. Each time you process an element from a list, you advance its index by 1. So after 6 steps for a list, you reach index 5. Then, when you process that element (index 5), the next index is 6, which is beyond the list's length (since each list has 6 elements). So, the algorithm will process all elements of all lists. Wait, no. Because each list has exactly 6 elements. For example, each list has elements at indices 0-5.

Suppose all lists have 6 elements. The algorithm would process each list's elements until all are processed. But how?

Wait, when you start, all lists have their first element (index 0) in the heap. Each time you pop an element from a list, you push the next element from that list (if exists). So for a list with 6 elements, you can process each of them. So for a list with 6 elements, the pointers can go from 0 to 5. Each time you process the i-th element, you push (i+1)-th if i+1 <6.

So when you process the 5th element (index 5) of a list, you try to push the next element (index 6, which is invalid). So the algorithm stops.

But all lists have 6 elements. So when the algorithm starts, each list is at index 0. The first element popped is the min of all initial elements. Then, the next element from the same list is pushed (index 1). This continues until a list's index reaches 5, and when that element is popped, the next index would be 6, which is invalid, so the algorithm stops.

Thus, the total number of steps would be the sum of the lengths of all lists minus the number of lists. Because each list contributes (number of elements) steps. Wait, not sure. Let me think with an example.

For a list with 6 elements:

Each element (0 to 5) is pushed once. When you pop the 0th element, you push 1st. When you pop 1st, you push 2nd, and so on. Finally, when you pop the 5th element, you can't push anything. So for each list, there are 6 elements processed. The number of steps (pops) is 6 per list. But since the algorithm stops as soon as any list is exhausted, and all lists have the same length, the algorithm will process 6 steps per list. Wait, but how does that work across multiple lists.

Wait, for n=2 lists, each with 3 elements:

List1: [1, 2, 3]

List2: [4, 5, 6]

Initial heap: 1 (List1) and 4 (List2). Max is 4. Range is 3.

Pop 1. Push 2. Now heap has 2 and4. Max is4. Range is4-2=2.

Pop 2. Push3. Heap has3 and4. Max4. Range 1.

Pop3. Can't push anything (next index is3, which is out of bounds). So algorithm stops.

So for list1, we processed 3 elements. For list2, only the initial element. But after processing list1's third element, the algorithm stops. So list2's other elements are not considered.

But in the original problem, all lists have 6 elements. So for each list, the algorithm processes 6 elements. But when you process the 6th element (index5) of any list, the algorithm stops. So the maximum number of steps is 6 * n.

Wait, but in the first step, you process the first element. Then, for each step, you process the next element of a list. So for each list, you process all 6 elements. For example, each list's elements are pushed into the heap one after another. So the algorithm would process all possible elements for all lists until the first list runs out of elements. But since all lists have 6 elements, the first time a list runs out is when all lists have their 6th element processed. Wait, no.

No. For example, suppose all lists have 6 elements. The algorithm starts by inserting the first element of each list into the heap. Then, the first step pops the smallest element (from some list) and pushes the next element from that list. Then, again, the next smallest element is popped, etc. So for a list, the first element is popped, then the second is pushed, then perhaps another list's element is popped, and so on. So each list's elements are being processed in order, but interleaved with elements from other lists.

But when any list's elements are exhausted (i.e., after popping its 6th element and trying to push the 7th, which doesn't exist), the algorithm stops. So if all lists have exactly 6 elements, then the algorithm will process each list's elements in order until all lists have their 6th element processed. Because once all lists have processed their 5th element (index 5), when you pop the 5th element of a list, you can't push the next. So the algorithm stops.

Wait, for example, all lists have 6 elements. The algorithm processes elements until one list's 6th element is popped. At that point, the next element would be beyond the list's length, so the algorithm stops.

But for each list, the 6 elements are processed in order, one after another.

So for n lists, each with 6 elements, the total steps (number of elements popped from the heap) is 6 * n. Because each list's elements are pushed into the heap once. But when you pop the first element of a list, you push the second, etc. So for each list, the number of elements popped is 6. But since the algorithm stops when any list's elements are exhausted, if all lists have 6 elements, the algorithm will process exactly 6 * n steps. But that's not possible. For example, in the case of 2 lists each with 3 elements, the algorithm stops after 3 steps.

Wait, in the 2-list example, each list has 3 elements. The algorithm processes 3 steps:

Step 1: pop 1, push 2. Step 2: pop 2, push3. Step3: pop3. Can't push, so stop.

So each step is a pop and possible push. The number of steps is equal to the total number of elements across all lists minus the number of lists. Because each list contributes (elements -1) steps (since the first element is pushed initially, and then each subsequent element is pushed when the previous is popped). For example, a list with k elements contributes (k) pops. But since the algorithm stops when any list can't push, the total steps would be the sum of (k_i) for all lists, but only until the first list is exhausted. Wait, no. Because once a list can't be pushed after a pop, the algorithm stops. So the total steps is the sum of the lengths of the lists, but in reality, it's more complicated.

In any case, given that each note has 6 elements, and n can be up to 1e5, the total number of elements is 6e5. The algorithm processes each element once (since each element is pushed into the heap once). But each element is popped once. So the total number of steps is 6e5.

Each step involves a heap insertion (log n) and a heap deletion (log n). So 6e5 * 2 * log(1e5) ≈ 6e5 * 2 * 17 ≈ 2.04e7 operations. Which is acceptable for Python in 2 seconds.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess each note's possible frets (6 per note) and sort each list.

2. Use the classic heap-based approach to find the minimal range that includes at least one element from each list.

Now, the code structure.

First, read the a array. Then read n, then the b array.

For each note in b:

   compute the possible frets as (b_j - a_i) for each a_i in the a array.

   collect these 6 values, sort them in ascending order.

So, for each note, we have a sorted list of possible frets.

Then, create a list of pointers for each note's list. Initially, each pointer is 0.

Create a min-heap. The heap will contain tuples of (current_fret, note_index, current_pointer).

The initial elements are the first element of each note's list. So for each note i, the current_pointer is 0, and the current_fret is sorted_frets[i][0].

The current_max is the maximum of all these initial elements.

We can compute this initial max by iterating through all notes and taking their first element.

Then, the minimal range is initialized as current_max - (heap top's value).

Then, the algorithm proceeds as follows:

While True:

   current_min is the top of the heap (the smallest element).

   current_range = current_max - current_min.

   update the minimal_range if current_range is smaller.

   Extract the current_min element (note_index, pointer) from the heap.

   Check if the note's list has next element (pointer +1 < len(list)).

   If yes:

       next_pointer = pointer + 1

       next_fret = sorted_frets[note_index][next_pointer]

       push (next_fret, note_index, next_pointer) into the heap.

       update current_max if next_fret > current_max.

   else:

       break the loop.

   Then, check the new range (current_max - new heap top's value).

So in code, we need to:

- Read a as a list of 6 integers.

- Read n, then read the list b of n integers.

- For each b_j in b, compute the list of (b_j - a_i) for each a_i, then sort the list.

- Sort each of these lists.

- Collect all sorted lists into a 2D array.

- For each list, track the current index (initially 0).

- Create a heap with elements (value, note_index, index_in_list).

- Compute the initial current_max as the maximum of the first elements of all lists.

- Push all the first elements into the heap.

- Then, track the minimal_range as current_max - (heap[0][0]).

Wait, but the heap is a priority queue, so heap[0] is the smallest. So initial current_max is the max of all first elements. The initial minimal range is current_max - heap[0][0].

Then, in each iteration:

   Pop the smallest element from the heap. This gives the note index and current pointer.

   If the note's list has a next element, push that into the heap. Update current_max if necessary.

   Then, compute the new current_max (which is either the same or the new element, if it's larger than previous current_max).

   The new range is current_max - heap[0][0].

   Update the minimal range if this new range is smaller.

But how to track the current_max? For example, when you push a new element into the heap, it could be larger than the current_max. So after each insertion, current_max is the maximum between current_max and the new element.

Yes. So when you push a new element into the heap, you compare it with the current_max and update if needed.

So the code steps:

Read a list of 6 integers.

Read n.

Read list b.

For each note in b:

   create a list of frets: [b_j - a_i for each a_i in a]

   sort the list in ascending order.

Now, for each note i, sorted_frets[i] is the sorted list.

Initialize pointers as [0] * n.

heap = []

current_max = -infinity

for i in range(n):

   val = sorted_frets[i][0]

   heapq.heappush(heap, (val, i, 0))

   if val > current_max:

       current_max = val

min_range = current_max - heap[0][0]

Then, loop:

while True:

   current_min, note_idx, ptr = heapq.heappop(heap)

   # Check if there is next element in note_idx's list

   if ptr + 1 < len(sorted_frets[note_idx]):

       next_ptr = ptr +1

       next_val = sorted_frets[note_idx][next_ptr]

       heapq.heappush(heap, (next_val, note_idx, next_ptr))

       # Update current_max if next_val is larger

       if next_val > current_max:

           current_max = next_val

       # Update the minimal range

       current_range = current_max - heap[0][0]

       if current_range < min_range:

           min_range = current_range

   else:

       break

Thus, after each push, we check the new range.

But in Python, the heap is a min-heap, so heap[0] is the current minimum.

So after each iteration, after pushing the new element (if possible), we calculate the current_range and compare with the min_range.

But in the case where we pop the current_min, then push a new element, which could be larger than the previous current_max, the current_max is updated, and the new range is current_max (new) - new heap top.

So this code should correctly track the minimal range.

Now, test case 1:

Sample input 1:

1 4 100 10 30 5

6

101 104 105 110 130 200

For each note:

b_j is 101: frets are 101 - a_i for each a_i:

101-1=100, 101-4=97, 101-100=1, 101-10=91, 101-30=71, 101-5=96. So sorted list would be [1, 71, 91, 96, 97, 100].

Wait no. Wait the a array is [1,4,100,10,30,5]. So for j=101:

The a_i's are 1,4,100,10,30,5. So the frets are:

100, 97, 1, 91, 71, 96. Sorted gives [1, 71,91,96,97,100].

Similarly for other notes. But according to the sample input, all notes can be played with fret 100, leading to a range of 0.

So the code should find that each note has 100 as an option, leading to all elements being 100. So the minimal range is 0.

But when processing the code:

Each note's sorted list would include 100. For example, in the first note's sorted list, 100 is the last element. But how would the algorithm find that all notes can pick 100?

The algorithm would start by pushing the first element of each note's list (the smallest possible). Then, the current_max is the maximum of all these first elements. Then, when you pop the smallest element, you replace it with the next element in that note's list, which is the next smallest.

So if each note's list contains 100, but they are not the first elements, the algorithm would have to process through the elements until all notes are at 100.

For example, in the first note's list, the first element is 1. The algorithm would process this first, replace it with 71, then process 71, then 91, etc., until all notes have their pointers at the position of 100.

But in this case, how would the algorithm find that all notes have 100 as an option? Because once all notes have their pointers at 100, the current_max and current_min would be 100, so the range is 0.

But the algorithm would process until all notes have their elements processed up to 100, but how?

This depends on how the sorted lists are structured. For each note, in their list, is 100 one of the elements?

In the first note's case, 100 is part of the list (101-1=100). So when the algorithm processes through all elements of that note's list, it would eventually reach 100.

But how to ensure that all notes are able to reach 100 in their lists.

But in the first sample, each note can be played on a string such that the fret is 100. So each note's list contains 100.

Thus, the algorithm would eventually reach a state where each note's pointer is at 100. At that point, the current_max and current_min would be 100, so the range is 0.

But the algorithm would find this when processing the elements.

So the code should work.

Now, the code's implementation.

But note that in Python, the heap is a min-heap. For each note, the list is sorted in ascending order, so the first element is the smallest. So the algorithm pushes the first elements, then replaces them with the next in order.

Now, for the first sample input, the code would process each note's list:

For each note, the list would have 100 as one of the options (for example, the first note's list is [1,71,91,96,97,100], the second note's list (104) would have 104-1=103, 104-4=100, etc. So the second note's list sorted would include 100. So for each note, there is a 100 in the list. So when the algorithm processes each note's elements, eventually, each note's pointer would reach 100, and the current_max and current_min would be 100, leading to a range of 0.

But the algorithm would process all elements until all lists have their 100 selected. However, the algorithm would stop when any list's pointer reaches the end. But in this case, since all lists have 6 elements (including 100), the algorithm would process until all lists' pointers are at 5 (the last element). But when processing the last element of any list (100), the next pointer would be 5+1=6, which is beyond the list's length. So the algorithm would break when any list's pointer reaches 5. But in that case, if all lists' last element is 100, then when the algorithm processes the first list's last element (100), then pushes the next (which is not possible), the algorithm breaks, but the current_max would be 100, and the heap's top would be 100. So the range would be 0.

Wait, but perhaps the algorithm could find the minimal range before processing all elements.

For example, when all lists have their 100 elements in some position. Once all lists have their pointers pointing to elements >=100, then the current_max would be 100 and the current_min would be 100.

But how?

The algorithm would process the elements step by step. For each step, it's possible that the current_max is 100 and the current_min is 100, leading to a range of 0, which would be the minimal possible.

Thus, the code would find this scenario.

So the code should handle the first sample correctly.

The second sample is more complex, but the code should process all possible elements and find the minimal range.

Now, for the code's memory constraints.

Each note's list has 6 elements. For n=1e5, that's 6e5 elements. Storing these as a list of lists is feasible. Each list takes O(6) space, so 1e5 lists would take 6e5 elements. That's manageable.

The heap will have 1e5 elements (each note's current element) initially, and during processing, each element is popped and replaced (if possible). So the maximum heap size is 1e5, which is manageable.

Thus, the code should be efficient.

Now, the code:

Read a as 6 integers.

Read n.

Read b as n integers.

For each b_j in b:

   compute the list of b_j - a_i for each a_i.

   sort the list.

sorted_frets is a list of lists.

Then, initialize the heap.

current_max is initialized by iterating each note's first element.

Then, the loop.

But in Python, the heapq module allows us to push and pop elements.

Now, code steps:

Testing against sample input 1.

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

        frets = []
        for ai in a:

        frets.sort()
        sorted_frets.append(frets)

    heap = []
    current_max = -float('inf')

    for i in range(n):
        val = sorted_frets[i][0]

        if val > current_max:

            if next_val > current_max:
                current_max = next_val
            # Update the minimal range
            current_range = current_max - heap[0][0]
            if current_range < min_range:
                min_range = current_range
        else:
            break

    print(min_range, file=output_stream)

The code for the second sample:

Sample input:

1 1 2 2 3 3

7

13 4 11 12 11 13 12

The a array is [1,1,2,2,3,3]

The notes are:

13,4,11,12,11,13,12.

For each note, compute all possible frets (note - a_i):

For example, the first note 13:

13-1=12, 13-1=12, 13-2=11, 13-2=11, 13-3=10, 13-3=10 → sorted [10,10,11,11,12,12]

The second note 4:

4-1=3, 4-1=3, 4-2=2, 4-2=2, 4-3=1, 4-3=1 → sorted [1,1,2,2,3,3]

The third note 11:

11-1=10, 11-1=10, 11-2=9, 11-2=9, 11-3=8, 11-3=8 → sorted [8,8,9,9,10,10]

The fourth note 12:

12-1=11, 12-1=11, 12-2=10, 12-2=10, 12-3=9, 12-3=9 → sorted [9,9,10,10,11,11]

The fifth note 11: same as third → [8,8,9,9,10,10]

The sixth note 13: same as first → [10,10,11,11,12,12]

The seventh note 12: same as fourth → [9,9,10,10,11,11]

Now, the code's algorithm starts by pushing the first elements of each note's list:

Note 0 (13): 10

Note 1 (4): 1

Note 2 (11):8

Note 3 (12):9

Note 4 (11):8

Note 5 (13):10

Note 6 (12):9

The initial heap elements are (10,0,0), (1,1,0), (8,2,0), (9,3,0), (8,4,0), (10,5,0), (9,6,0). The current_max is the maximum of these values, which is 10. The initial range is 10 - 1 =9.

But then, the algorithm starts popping the minimum elements.

The first element popped is 1 (note 1, index 0). The next element in note1's list is 1 (since the list is [1,1,2,2,3,3], sorted). So next_ptr is 1. Push (1,1,1) into the heap. current_max remains 10. New range is 10 - 8 (since the new heap's top is 8 from note2). So range is 2. But min_range is now 2.

Then, the next popped element is 8 (note2, index0). Next_ptr is1. Push 8. current_max remains 10. New range is 10 -8 = 2. No change.

Then, the next popped element is 8 (note4, index0). Next_ptr is1. Push 8. current_max remains 10. New range is 10-8=2.

Then, the next popped is 8 (note2, index1). Push next element, 9. Now the heap's top is 9 (note3's 9). current_max is max(10,9) =10. range is 10-9=1. min_range is now 1.

Continue this process until the algorithm eventually finds a window where all notes have their elements in a certain range. But the sample's optimal solution is 7. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the algorithm isn't finding the correct window.

Wait, the sample's optimal solution is to play the second note (4) on the first string (fret 3?), wait, wait. Let's recheck the sample's explanation.

In the second example, the sample input a is [1,1,2,2,3,3]. The melody is [13,4,11,12,11,13,12].

The solution explanation says: play the second note (4) on the first string (fret 4-1=3), and all other notes on the sixth string (3+ j = note). The sixth string has a_i=3, so fret is note -3. For example, note 13 is fret 10. So the second note is played on fret 3, others on fret 10. So the max is 10, min is 3. Range is 7.

So in the code's algorithm, how would this be found.

Each note has to select a fret. For the second note (4), its possible frets are 3,3,2,2,1,1 (sorted [1,1,2,2,3,3]). So the possible frets for note1 are 1,1,2,2,3,3.

To have the second note's fret as 3, the code would need to process the fifth or sixth element of its list. But in the algorithm's initial steps, the code is processing the earliest elements first.

So for the second note's list, the code would first push 1 (elements 0 and 1), then when popped, push 1 (elements 1), then when popped again, push 2 (element 2), and so on.

At some point, the code would process the fifth element (3) of the second note's list. At that point, the current_max would be 10 (from other notes), and the current_min would be 3. The range is 7.

But the algorithm needs to find that combination.

This suggests that the code's approach is correct and would find the minimal range of 7.

But how?

Perhaps after processing several elements, the heap contains some 3 from the second note, and 10 from other notes.

The code would track the current_max and current_min as the range.

But this requires that at some step, the current_max is 10, and the current_min is 3.

So the algorithm would have to process the second note's list until it reaches 3.

But the code's approach is to process the elements in order of their values. So if the code's current_max is 10 (from other notes) and the heap's top is 3, then the range would be 7.

So the code should find this.

But how does the code arrive at that scenario.

For example, after the second note's list has been processed until the fifth element (3), and other notes' elements are processed up to 10.

So, the code's algorithm would process the elements in order, and eventually reach a state where some notes have their frets as 10, and the second note's fret is 3.

But the code is designed to find the minimal range, so it must find that scenario.

But how?

Well, the code's algorithm is designed to consider all possible combinations where each note's current element is as small as possible, but the code tries to minimize the range.

In the sample scenario, the code would have to process the second note's list until it reaches 3, and other notes' lists reach 10. Then the current_max would be 10, and the current_min would be 3, leading to a range of 7.

But how does the algorithm reach that state.

Let's think step by step.

Initially, the code's heap contains the first elements of each note's list.

The second note's first element is 1. Other notes' first elements are 8,9, etc.

The initial current_max is 10 (from note 0's first element, which is 10? Or no: note 0 is 13. So 13-1=12, but wait, no. Let's recalculate.

Wait, the first note in the second sample is 13.

The a array is [1,1,2,2,3,3].

So for note 13: the frets are:

13-1=12, 13-1=12, 13-2=11, 13-2=11, 13-3=10, 13-3=10. So sorted is [10,10,11,11,12,12].

So the first element is 10.

Similarly, the sixth note is 13, which also has first element 10.

The seventh note is 12: 12-3=9. So sorted list for note 12 is [9,9,10,10,11,11].

So the initial heap's elements are:

note0:10

note1:1

note2:8 (from 11-3=8)

note3:9 (12-3=9)

note4:8 (11-3=8)

note5:10 (13-3=10)

note6:9 (12-3=9)

current_max is 10.

The initial range is 10-1=9.

Then, the algorithm starts processing.

Step 1: pop 1 (note1's first element). Push note1's next element (1). current_max remains 10. New range is 10-8=2. min_range is 2.

Step 2: pop 8 (note2's first element). Push 8 (next element). current_max still 10. New range is 10-8=2.

Step3: pop 8 (note4's first element). Push 8 (next element). current_max 10. New range 10-8=2.

Step4: pop 8 (note2's second element). Push 9. current_max is 10. new range 10-8=2. Heap top is now 8 (note4's 8).

Wait, no. After note2's second element is 8, pushing 9 (element 2 of note2's list). Then, the heap's new elements include 9. But the current_max is still 10. The new heap's top is 8 (note4's 8).

So the new range is 10-8=2.

Step5: pop 8 (note4's second element). Push 8 (element 2 of note4's list). current_max 10. range 10-8=2.

Step6: pop 8 (note4's element 2). Push 9 (element 3 of note4's list). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1. min_range is now 1.

Step7: pop 9 (note3's element 0). Push 9 (element 1). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step8: pop 9 (note6's element 0). Push 9 (element 1). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step9: pop 9 (note3's element 1). Push 10 (element 2). current_max becomes 10 (since 10 is pushed). new range 10-9=1.

Step10: pop 9 (note6's element 1). Push 10 (element 2). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step11: pop 9 (note3's element 2). Push 10 (element3). current_max remains 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step12: pop 9 (note6's element 2). Push 10 (element3). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step13: pop 10 (note0's element0). Push 10 (element1). current_max 10. new range 10-9=1.

Step14: pop 10 (note0's element1). Push 11 (element2). current_max is now 11. new range 11-9=2.

Step15: pop 10 (note5's element0). Push 10 (element1). current_max 11. new range 11-9=2.

Step16: pop 10 (note5's element1). Push 11 (element2). current_max 11. new range 11-9=2.

Step17: pop 10 (element3 of note3). Push 10 (element3). current_max 11. new range 11-10=1.

Step18: pop 10 (element3 of note6). Push 10 (element3). current_max 11. new range 11-10=1.

Step19: pop 10 (element3 of note0). Push 11 (element4). current_max remains 11. new range 11-10=1.

Step20: pop 10 (element1 of note1's list). The note1's list is [1,1,2,2,3,3]. The first elements were 1,1. Now, after the first pop, the next element is 1 (element1). Then, the next push is element2 (2). So after processing step1 (popping 1, element0 and pushing element1), the note1's current element is 1. When that is popped (now in step20?), we push element2 (2). current_max becomes max(11, 2) → 11. new range 11-2=9. But min_range is still 1.

But this seems to suggest that the code would not find the range of 7. Hmm.

But perhaps the code's algorithm is not considering all possible combinations, but only those where the current elements are the earliest possible. But the sample's optimal solution requires that the second note is played at fret3 (the fifth element of its list), while other notes are played at fret10 (the fifth element of their lists).

But the code's algorithm would process the second note's list step by step. For example:

Each time the second note's element is popped, the code pushes the next element. So the second note's pointer increments from 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4,5.

So, after processing:

Note1's elements: 1 (element0), 1 (element1), 2 (element2), 2 (element3), 3 (element4), 3 (element5).

So when the code processes note1's element4 (3), the current_max could be 10 from other notes, leading to a range of 10-3=7.

But how does this happen.

The code would have to process the note1's list until element4 (3) is pushed into the heap. Then, when this element is the current_min in the heap, and the current_max is 10, the range would be 7.

So the code would need to process the second note's list until the element4 (3) is pushed into the heap.

But during the steps, the algorithm may have already processed other notes to higher elements.

But how would the code reach this scenario.

This requires that other notes are at higher elements (like 10), while note1's element is at3.

But in the code's algorithm, the current_max is the maximum of all elements in the heap. So when note1's element is3, other notes must have elements less than or equal to3, but this is not possible because other notes have higher elements.

Wait, no. If other notes have elements like 10, then the current_max would be 10, and the heap's top is3. So the range would be 7.

But how can other notes have elements higher than3 while the current_max is10.

For example, if some notes are at10 (their elements are10), and the second note is at3.

But in that case, the current_max is10, the current_min is3. The range is7.

But how does the code get to that state.

Let's think. The code's algorithm processes elements in order of their values. So once the heap contains elements like3 (from note1) and10 (from other notes), the current_max is10, and the current_min is3.

But in order for the heap to contain those elements, all other notes must have elements >=3.

But how to get to that state.

The code's algorithm would have to process the second note's list until it's at3 (element4 or5). Meanwhile, other notes must have their elements >=3 and possibly as high as10.

But how.

For example, let's say after many steps, the code processes the second note's element4 (3) and pushes it into the heap. At that time, other notes' current elements are10.

So the heap would have a mix of 3 (from note1) and 10s (from other notes). The current_max is10, and the current_min is3. The range is7.

The algorithm would record this range if it's better than the previous minimal range.

But the code's current_min is3, and current_max is10. So the range is7.

But how does the code reach this scenario.

The code processes each note's elements in order. So for other notes to be at10, they must have processed their elements up to the fifth or sixth element.

For example, the first note's list is [10,10,11,11,12,12]. To reach 10, the pointer is at index0 or 1. But once the code pushes the next elements (10, then 11, etc.), the first note's elements are no longer 10.

So in this case, other notes' elements would have higher values, but the code's algorithm would not allow them to be 10 once they've been processed.

Thus, the code's algorithm may not find the desired scenario.

This suggests that the code's approach is not sufficient for the second sample. But according to the problem statement, the code's approach is the correct one for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's approach.

Wait, perhaps the code's approach is correct and the sample's optimal solution is indeed found. Let me think.

In the sample's optimal solution, the second note is played on the first string (fret 3), and the other notes are played on the sixth string (fret 10). So for each of the other notes (notes 0,3,4,5,6,2), their fret is10.

For example, note0 (13) is played on the sixth string (3+10=13). So fret is 10.

For note3 (12), played on sixth string (3+9=12), so fret is9. Wait, no. Wait, the sixth string's a_i is3, so fret is b_j - a_i. So for note3 (12), fret is 12-3=9.

But in the sample's explanation, all other notes are played on the sixth string, which has a_i=3. So the fret for note3 is9, for example.

So the sample's optimal solution has notes0 (13) on sixth string (fret 10), notes3 (12) on sixth string (fret9), note6 (12) on sixth string (fret9), etc.

Thus, the fret values for the other notes vary. So the code's algorithm would need to select for each note the appropriate fret to minimize the overall range.

But according to the sample's explanation, the maximal fret is10 (from note0) and the minimal is3 (from note1), leading to a range of7.

So in the code's algorithm, during processing, when the second note's fret is3, and note0's fret is10, the range is7. So the code must have such a state.

But how does the code reach that state.

Note that the code's algorithm tracks the current_max as the maximum of all elements in the heap. So when the second note's element is3, and note0's element is10, the current_max is10. The current_min is3, leading to range7.

But how does the code's algorithm reach such a state.

This would require that after processing certain elements, the heap contains 3 (from note1) and 10 (from note0), along with other elements between3 and10.

But how.

For example, suppose note0's current element is10 (element0 or1 of its list). Note1's current element is3 (element4 or5). Other notes' current elements are between3 and10.

But how does the algorithm get to this state.

The algorithm processes elements in order of their values. So when the code processes elements from other notes, they may have higher values. For example, note0's elements are10,10,11,11,12,12. So if the code has pushed the first two elements (10 and10), then when the code processes other elements, note0's elements would be replaced with higher values.

But in the scenario where note0's element is10 (element1), note1's element is3 (element4), and other notes' elements are9 or10, the current_max is10, current_min is3. Range is7.

But how does the code get here.

This requires that the algorithm processes the second note's list until element4 (3) is pushed, while other notes' elements are processed to higher values.

But the code's algorithm processes elements in order of their values. So once the code has processed the second note's element4 (3), that element is pushed into the heap. Then, when it is the minimum element in the heap, the code would pop it and compute the range.

But at that moment, the current_max is the maximum of all elements in the heap, which could be10 from note0.

Thus, the code would record a range of7.

But this scenario requires that when the second note's element3 is pushed, other notes' elements are higher than3.

But how.

The code's algorithm is designed to process the elements in order, but each time you pop the minimum element from the heap.

So for example, after pushing the second note's element4 (3), the heap may have other elements like9,10, etc. But the new element3 is the new minimum, so it would be popped next.

When popped, the code would check if there is a next element (element5, which is3). Push it into the heap. The current_max would remain10.

The new heap's top would be3 again (element5 of note1). The range is10-3=7.

But the code would then pop this3 and push the next element (element5+1=6, which is out of bounds). So the algorithm would break.

Thus, in this case, the code would have recorded a range of7 during the previous steps.

Thus, the code would output7.

But how to confirm.

This depends on the code's processing steps, which are complex. But given that the code's algorithm is the correct approach for the classic problem, it should handle the sample correctly.

Thus, the code should work for both samples.
