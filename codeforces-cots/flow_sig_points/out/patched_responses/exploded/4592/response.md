Okay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of pairs (i, j) where the substring from i to j contains at least one occurrence of "bear". Hmm. The straightforward approach would be to check all possible substrings, but that's O(n²) time, which for n=5000 would be 25 million operations. But maybe there's a smarter way.

First, we need to find all positions where "bear" occurs. For example, if "bear" starts at position k, then any substring that includes this occurrence will be counted. So, for each occurrence of "bear", we can calculate how many substrings include it and haven't been counted before (to avoid overlapping counts).

Wait, but overlapping or multiple occurrences might complicate things. Let's think: for each occurrence of "bear" starting at k, the substring x(i,j) must include this occurrence. So for this k, the possible i's are from 1 to k, and j's from k+3 to the end. Because the substring has to start before or at k and end after or at k+3. So for each such occurrence, the number of possible pairs (i,j) is k * (n - (k+3) + 1). Wait, let's see. Let me rephrase.

Suppose "bear" is at positions k to k+3. Then, for this occurrence to be included in x(i,j), i must be ≤k and j must be ≥k+3. Because the substring x(i,j) must include the entire "bear" sequence. So the number of possible (i,j) pairs for this occurrence is (k) * (n - (k+3) + 1). Wait, k is the number of possible i's (from 1 to k) and (n - (k+3) +1) is the number of possible j's (from k+3 to n). So multiply them gives the count for this occurrence.

But wait, overlapping. For example, if there's another occurrence starting at k+1. Then, some substrings might include both occurrences. So if we just sum all the counts for each occurrence, we'd be double-counting those substrings that include multiple "bear" occurrences.

So the problem here is overlapping ranges. So the correct approach is to find all the positions where "bear" starts, and then for each such position, calculate the earliest possible i and j such that the occurrence is included, and then subtract overlapping counts.

Alternatively, we can find all the occurrences of "bear", then for each occurrence, compute how many new substrings are added by this occurrence that haven't been counted by the previous occurrences.

Hmm. Let's think of the first occurrence. The first occurrence at position k. Then the substrings that include this occurrence are those i <=k and j >=k+3. The total for this is (k) * (n - (k+3) +1) = k*(n -k -2).

Now, for the next occurrence at position m. But any substring that includes m's occurrence might also include the first occurrence. So the substrings that include m's occurrence but haven't been counted before are those where i is between the previous occurrence's start +1 and m, but perhaps we need to track the earliest i that hasn't been covered yet.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to process each occurrence and calculate the number of possible i's that are <= the current occurrence's start, and j's >= the occurrence's end (start+3), but subtract the ones that were already counted by previous occurrences.

Alternatively, for each occurrence, the earliest possible i is 1, and the earliest possible j is the occurrence's end. But when there are previous occurrences, the i can start from the previous occurrence's start +1, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to track the last position where a "bear" started. For each occurrence, the number of new substrings contributed is (k - prev) * (n - (k+3) + 1). Here, prev is the previous occurrence's start. Because the i can be from (prev + 1) to k. So this ensures that we don't count overlapping i ranges. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Suppose we have two occurrences: first at k1, then at k2 (k2 >k1). For the first occurrence, the substrings are all i <=k1 and j >=k1+3. For the second occurrence, the substrings are all i <=k2 and j >=k2+3. But some of these substrings were already counted in the first occurrence. So to avoid overcounting, we need to find the contribution of the second occurrence that is not already covered by the first.

So the way to do this is to find for each occurrence, the leftmost i that hasn't been considered before. For example, the first occurrence's left is from i=1 to k1. The second occurrence's left is from i=1 to k2. But any i <=k1 is already covered in the first occurrence's contribution. So the new contribution for the second occurrence is (k2 - k1) * (n - (k2 +3) +1). Because the i can be from (k1 +1) to k2. Then the j has to be >=k2+3. But wait, maybe j can also be between k1+3 and k2+3, but then those j's would have been covered by the first occurrence.

Wait, no. Because j has to be >=k2+3 for the second occurrence's contribution. So in this case, the j's are >=k2+3, which is larger than k1+3 (since k2>k1). So the j's for the second occurrence are larger, so those substrings would not have been counted in the first occurrence. Therefore, the overlapping i's would be from 1 to k1, but j's are >=k2+3, which were not counted before. So the first occurrence's contribution includes i from 1 to k1 and j from k1+3 to n. The second's contribution includes i from 1 to k2 and j from k2+3 to n. So the overlapping i's (1 to k1) with j >=k2+3 are new. So the total contribution for the second occurrence is k2 * (n - (k2+3) +1). But this counts the i's from 1 to k2, which includes the i's from 1 to k1. But those i's with j >=k2+3 are not part of the first occurrence's j's (since j in first's case is >=k1+3). So those would be new substrings.

Wait, maybe summing all contributions is correct. For example, each occurrence contributes (k_i) * (n - (k_i +3) +1). Summing all of those. But that would count some substrings multiple times. For example, a substring that includes two "bear" occurrences would be counted once for each occurrence. But the problem requires that the substring has at least one occurrence. So even if a substring has multiple "bear" occurrences, it's still counted once. Therefore, the initial approach of summing all (k_i * (n -k_i -3 +1)) would overcount, because a substring that includes multiple "bear"s would be counted multiple times. So the total would be higher than the correct answer.

So that's the problem. So the correct approach is to find all possible (i,j) pairs where there's at least one "bear" in x(i,j). So the inclusion-exclusion principle isn't straightforward here.

Alternative approach: the total number of possible (i,j) pairs is n*(n+1)/2. The number of pairs where the substring does not contain "bear" is the complement. So the answer is total_pairs - pairs_without_bear.

Calculating pairs_without_bear might be easier. Because then we can find all regions where "bear" does not occur, and compute the number of pairs in those regions.

Wait, how? Let's think. A substring that does not contain "bear" must be such that it does not have any occurrence of "bear" as a substring. So the entire substring must lie between occurrences of "bear".

For example, if the original string has "bear" starting at positions k1, k2, ..., km, then any substring that is entirely before k1, or between k1+3 and k2, etc., and does not include any of the "bear" substrings.

So the idea is to split the string into segments where there are no "bear" occurrences. Then, for each such segment of length L, the number of pairs (i,j) within that segment is L*(L+1)/2. Sum all these, then subtract from the total to get the answer.

But this approach requires that we find all the regions where there are no "bear" substrings. Let me think.

Alternatively, the approach is to find all the intervals where there's no "bear" and compute their contribution. Let's proceed step by step.

First, find all the starting indices where "bear" occurs. For example, if the string is "bearbtear", then "bear" starts at index 0 (assuming 0-based) and index 5 (since "btear" would start at 5 in the string "bearbtear"? Wait, the input example is "bearbtear" and the output is 6. Let me check. In the first sample input, the correct pairs are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). So in that case, the "bear" starts at position 1 (since in 1-based, the first 'b' is at 1). So the occurrence is at positions 1-4. Then, any substring that includes this occurrence. The j must be >=4. So the i can be 1 to 1 (since the first occurrence starts at 1?), so the count is 1*(n -4 +1) where n is 9? 1*(9-4+1) =1*6=6, which matches the sample.

So the approach where we sum for each occurrence the product of (k) * (n - (k+3) +1) seems to work for this case. But when there are multiple occurrences, how does that work?

Let's take the second example. Input is "bearaabearc" (length 11). The "bear" occurs at positions 0 (0-based) and 5 (since "bearaabearc" has "bear" starting at 0 and then "aabearc" — the next "bear" starts at 5). So the occurrences are at 0 and 5 (0-based) or 1 and 6 in 1-based.

For each occurrence, the contribution is:

First occurrence (0-based, starts at 0):

k=0 (1-based? No, perhaps the code should be 0-based. Wait, the problem statement uses 1-based indices for i and j. So in code, the string is 0-based, but when processing the occurrence positions, we need to adjust.

Wait, maybe the code will process the string as 0-based, and for each occurrence at position k (0-based, start of "bear"), the substring is s[k..k+3]. So for each occurrence at k (0-based), the i can be from 0 to k (inclusive) in 0-based, which is 1-based i from 1 to k+1. Wait, maybe it's easier to process in 0-based. So, for the occurrence starting at k (0-based), the i must be <=k (0-based) and j must be >=k+3 (0-based). So the number of possible pairs (i,j) for this occurrence is (k+1) * (n - (k+3) +1). Because i can be 0-based from 0 to k (k+1 options), and j can be from k+3 to n-1 (inclusive) which is (n-1 - (k+3) +1) = n -k -3 options. So total (k+1)*(n -k -3).

But when we have multiple occurrences, if a substring (i,j) includes multiple "bear" occurrences, it would be counted multiple times in the sum. But the problem requires that each such pair is counted exactly once. So summing all (k+1)*(n -k -3) for each occurrence would overcount the total. So this approach is incorrect.

So that's the problem. So the initial approach is wrong because it counts overlapping pairs multiple times. Therefore, we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: For a substring (i,j) to be valid, it must contain at least one occurrence of "bear". So the earliest occurrence in the substring determines the earliest possible i and j. So perhaps we can process the occurrences in order and calculate the contribution of each occurrence, ensuring that the pairs counted for this occurrence are those that include this occurrence and do not include any earlier occurrence.

Wait, no. Because a substring may include both this occurrence and a previous occurrence, but we need to count it exactly once. So perhaps the way is to find for each occurrence, the earliest possible i and j that can be contributed by this occurrence and not by any previous occurrence.

Alternatively, the leftmost occurrence of "bear" in the substring (i,j) would determine how much the current occurrence contributes. Hmm. Not sure.

Let's think of the example where there are two occurrences. Let's say occurrence1 at k1 and occurrence2 at k2 >k1. Any substring (i,j) that includes occurrence2 and is such that the earliest occurrence is occurrence2. Then, for such substrings, i can be from (k1+4) to k2, and j >=k2+3. But that's not correct. Wait, perhaps for a substring that includes both occurrence1 and occurrence2, the earliest occurrence is occurrence1, so it would have been counted in the contribution of occurrence1. Therefore, when considering occurrence2, we only want to count the substrings that include occurrence2 but do not include occurrence1. Or wait, no. Because if a substring includes both occurrence1 and occurrence2, then it is already counted in occurrence1's contribution (since occurrence1 is earlier). So for occurrence2's contribution, we should count only the substrings that include occurrence2 and do not include any previous occurrence.

Wait, maybe that's the key. For each occurrence, the valid pairs (i,j) are those where i <=k (the occurrence's start) and j >=k+3, but i is after the end of all previous occurrences. Wait, no. Let's think again.

For occurrence1 (start at k1), the valid pairs are i <=k1, j >=k1+3.

For occurrence2 (start at k2 >k1), the valid pairs are i <=k2, j >=k2+3. But if i is <=k1 and j >=k1+3, those pairs are already counted in occurrence1. So to avoid overcounting, the contribution of occurrence2 should be (k2 - (k1 +4) +1) * (n - (k2+3) +1). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, for occurrence2, the possible i's are from the previous occurrence's start + occurrence's length (k1 +4) up to k2. Because if i is <=k1, then j >=k2+3 would include both occurrences, but those pairs would have been counted in occurrence1's contribution. So the new pairs for occurrence2 are those where i is between (k1 +4) and k2, and j >=k2+3. Then the count would be (k2 - (k1+4) +1) * (n - (k2+3) +1). But perhaps this is the way to go.

Wait, let's take the second sample input: "bearaabearc" (1-based: positions 1-11). The "bear" starts at 1 and 6. So for the first occurrence, k1=1 (1-based) (0-based would be 0). The contribution is (1) * (11 - (1+3) +1) = 1*(8) =8. Then the second occurrence k2=6 (1-based), contribution is (6- (1+3) +1) * (11 - (6+3) +1) = (6-4 +1) * (3) =3*3=9. Then sum 8+9=17, but the sample output is 20. So this approach is wrong.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternative approach: Let's model the valid (i,j) pairs as those that include at least one occurrence of "bear". To count these pairs, perhaps it's better to find for each position i, the earliest occurrence of "bear" that starts at or after i, and then compute for each i the number of j's that are >= the end of that occurrence.

Wait, here's an idea: For each i, find the earliest occurrence of "bear" that starts at or after i. Let's say this occurrence starts at k (i <=k). Then, any j >=k+3 will include this occurrence. The number of j's for this i is (n - (k+3) +1) if k exists. If there's no such k, then this i contributes nothing. Summing over all i gives the total number of valid pairs.

This approach would work because each valid pair (i,j) is counted once, specifically when i is considered and k is the first occurrence of "bear" in the substring starting at i. So, for example, if there are multiple occurrences in the substring, the first one is considered.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute all the occurrences of "bear" in the string. Let's call this list starts, which contains all the starting indices (0-based) where "bear" occurs.

2. For each i from 0 to n-1, find the smallest k in starts such that k >= i. If such a k exists, then the earliest occurrence that starts at or after i is k. The earliest possible j for this i is k+3. So the number of valid j's is max(0, n - (k+3) +1) = max(0, n -k -3 +1) = max(0, n -k -2). Sum this for all i where such a k exists.

3. The sum will be the total number of valid pairs.

Let's test this approach with the first sample input. The input is "bearbtear", which is "bearbtear". The occurrences are at 0 (0-based). So starts = [0]. For each i from 0 to 8 (since length is 9):

For i=0: the earliest k is 0. j can be from 3 to 8. So 8-3+1=6. So 6 j's. So contribution is 6.

For i=1: earliest k is 0 (but k >=i is 1? Wait no, 0 >=1 is false. So no, no k >=i. So the earliest k is None. So no contribution.

Wait wait, starts is [0]. So for i=0, the earliest k is 0. For i=1, there is no k >=i (since starts[0] is 0 <1). So contribution is 0. Similarly for i>=1, no contribution. So sum is 6, which matches the sample.

In the second sample input: "bearaabearc". Let's parse this. The string is "bearaabearc" which is 11 characters. Let's find the starts of "bear". "bear" starts at 0 (b at 0, e at1, a at2, r at3), and again at 5 (b at5, e at6, a at7, r at8). So starts = [0,5]. Now, for each i from 0 to 10:

For each i in 0-10:

We need to find the earliest k >=i in starts. Let's list this for each i.

i=0: earliest k is 0. j >=0+3=3. The number of j's is 10 -3 +1 =8.

i=1: k=0 is not >=1. So next k is 5. So j >=5+3=8. Number of j's is 10-8 +1=3.

i=2: k=0 is not >=2. Next is 5. j >=8. 3.

i=3: same as i=2. 5 is >=3. j>=8. 3.

i=4: same. 5 >=4. j>=8. 3.

i=5: k=5. j >=5+3=8. 10-8 +1=3.

i=6: next k after 6 is None (since starts are 0 and5, both less than 6). So no contribution.

Wait, wait. Starts is [0,5]. So for i=5, k=5 is >=5. For i=6, the starts are 0,5, both <6. So no occurrence starts >=6. So contribution for i=6 is 0.

Similarly for i=7,8,9,10: no k >=i. So contribution is 0.

So let's calculate the contributions:

i=0: 8
i=1: 3
i=2:3
i=3:3
i=4:3
i=5:3
others: 0.

So sum is 8 +3*5 =8+15=23. But the sample output is 20. So something's wrong here.

Wait, but the sample output is 20. So this approach gives 23, which is wrong. So where's the mistake?

Hmm. Let's recheck the sample.

Sample Input 2: "bearaabearc" which is 11 characters. The occurrences are at 0 and5 (0-based). The sample output is 20.

Wait, according to the note, the valid pairs are:

(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (2,10), (2,11), (3,10), (3,11), (4,10), (4,11), (5,10), (5,11), (6,10), (6,11), (7,10), (7,11).

Total 20 pairs.

But according to the approach, for i=0 (1-based i=1?), the earliest k is 0. j can be >=3 (0-based j=3, which is 4 in 1-based). So for i=0 (1-based i=1), j can be from 3 (4) up to 10 (11). So the number of j's is 11 -3 =8 (since j can be 3,4,...,10: 8 elements). Wait, 10-3+1=8. So 8. So that's correct. The i=0 in 0-based is 1 in 1-based. The contribution for i=0 (1-based i=1) is 8 j's (from j=3 to j=10 (0-based) which is 4 to 11 in 1-based).

Then for i=1 (0-based, 1-based i=2), the earliest k is 5 (0-based). So j must be >=8 (0-based). j can be 8,9,10. So 3 j's. So for 1-based i=2, j can be 9,10,11. So 3 options. So the pairs (2,9), (2,10), (2,11) are counted. But according to the sample, (2,10) and (2,11) are valid. Wait, why?

Wait the sample says (2,10) and (2,11) are valid. So in 0-based terms, i=1 (1-based i=2) and j=9 (1-based j=10) and j=10 (11). The occurrence at 5 (0-based) starts at 5, so the substring from i=1 to j=9 (0-based) includes 5,5+3=8. So 5+3=8 is the end of the "bear". So j=9 >=8. So j=9 is allowed. So the j's for i=1 (0-based) are 8,9,10. So three j's. So the pairs (i=1, j=8), (i=1, j=9), (i=1, j=10) (0-based) correspond to 1-based (2,9), (2,10), (2,11). But according to the sample, the pairs (2,10) and (2,11) are included. What's j=9 in 0-based? 0-based j=9 is 10 in 1-based. So the substring from 2 to 10 (1-based) is i=2, j=10 (1-based) which includes the "bear" at 5 (0-based) which is 6 in 1-based. So in this case, for i=1 (0-based, 1-based 2), the j's allowed are 8,9,10 (0-based), which are 9,10,11 in 1-based. So the pairs (2,9), (2,10), (2,11). But according to the sample note, (2,10) and (2,11) are present. So why is (2,9) not present?

Ah, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's see. In the sample note, the pairs (i,j) are listed as (2, 10), (2,11), etc. So for (2,10), i=2 (1-based), j=10 (1-based). The substring is from 2 to 10. Does this include any "bear"?

Looking at the original string: "bearaabearc" (1-based indices 1-11). The first occurrence is 1-4, the second is 6-9 (since the "bear" starts at 6). The substring from 2 to 10 is "earaabear". Let's see if it contains "bear". Let's check positions 6-9 (since that's the second "bear" in the original string). The substring from 2-10 (1-based) is positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. So the second "bear" starts at 6 (1-based), which is within this substring. So the substring (2,10) does include the "bear" at 6-9. So it's valid. Similarly, (2,9) would be from 2 to9, which includes the same "bear". So why isn't (2,9) in the sample note?

Wait, the sample note's pairs for the second sample include (2,10), (2,11), (3,10), (3,11), etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the sample explanation. Let me check again.

The note says:

In the second sample, the following pairs (i, j) match:

(1, 4), (1,5), ..., (1,11), (2,10), (2,11), (3,10), (3,11), (4,10), (4,11), (5,10), (5,11), (6,10), (6,11), (7,10), (7,11).

So, for i=2 (1-based), j=10 and 11. So j=10 is 10 (1-based), which is 9 in 0-based. So according to our approach, the j's allowed are 8,9,10 (0-based), which are 9,10,11 in 1-based. So the pairs (2,9), (2,10), (2,11) should all be valid. But the sample note includes only (2,10), (2,11). So this suggests that the approach is overcounting.

Hmm, this discrepancy suggests that the approach is incorrect. So why is (2,9) not in the sample's list?

Wait, let's look at the original sample's note. Let's parse it again.

The sample's note lists:

(1, 4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), (1,11),

(2, 10), (2, 11),

(3, 10), (3, 11),

(4, 10), (4, 11),

(5, 10), (5, 11),

(6, 10), (6, 11),

(7, 10), (7, 11).

So for i=2 (1-based), j=10 and 11. So why isn't j=9 included? Because in the substring (2,9) (1-based), which is 2<=i <=j <=9. The substring is from 2 to9. Let's check if this contains any "bear". The original string is "bearaabearc" (1-based):

Indices 1: b, 2:e,3:a,4:r,5:a,6:a,7:b,8:e,9:a,10:r,11:c.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the string. Let me re-examine the sample input 2: "bearaabearc".

Original string (0-based):

0: b

1: e

2: a

3: r

4: a

5: a

6: b

7: e

8: a

9: r

10: c

So the first "bear" is at 0-3 (indices 0,1,2,3: 'b','e','a','r').

Then the next part is a a b e a r c. So the next "bear" would start at 6-9 (6: b,7:e,8:a,9:r). So yes, starts are 0 and6 (0-based). Wait, so in the second occurrence, the "bear" is from 6 to 9 (0-based).

So for i=1 (0-based), j must be >=k+3. k is 6 in this case. So j >=9 (0-based). So j can be 9 or10.

So for i=1 (0-based), j can be 9 or 10. So the contribution is 2.

But according to the approach, for i=1 (0-based), the earliest k is 6. j >=9. So number of j's is 10-9+1=2. So the contribution is 2.

So why did the previous calculation say 3? Because earlier, I thought starts were 0 and5. But in reality, the second occurrence starts at6 (0-based). So the starts list is [0,6].

So for i=1 (0-based), the earliest k is6. So j >=6+3=9. The j can be 9 or10. So 2 j's.

Ah, this is where the error was. The second occurrence starts at6, not5. So the starts list is [0,6].

So let's redo the calculation for the second sample.

The sample input is "bearaabearc", which in 0-based indices is:

0: b

1: e

2: a

3: r

4: a

5: a

6: b

7: e

8: a

9: r

10: c

So the first "bear" is at0-3. The next "bear" starts at6 (6,7,8,9). So starts = [0,6].

Now, for each i from0 to10 (0-based):

For i=0: earliest k is0. j >=3. So j can be3-10. 8 j's (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). So contribution 8.

i=1: earliest k is0? No. i=1. k=0 is <1. So next k is6. j >=9. j=9,10. 2 j's. Contribution 2.

i=2: earliest k is6. j >=9. 2 j's. Contribution 2.

i=3: same as i=2. 2.

i=4: same. 2.

i=5: same. 2.

i=6: earliest k is6. j >=9. j=9,10. 2.

i=7: next k after7 is None. Because starts are0 and6. So no contribution.

i=8: same as i=7.

i=9: same.

i=10: same.

So the total contributions are:

i=0:8

i=1:2

i=2:2

i=3:2

i=4:2

i=5:2

i=6:2

sum=8 + (2*6) =8+12=20. Which matches the sample. So the approach is correct.

So the mistake earlier was due to incorrect starts for the second occurrence. So the approach works if we correctly find the starts.

Therefore, the correct algorithm is:

1. Find all the starting positions where "bear" occurs in the string. These are the indices k (0-based) where s[k:k+4] == 'bear'.

2. For each i in 0-based, find the earliest k in starts that is >=i. If such a k exists, then the number of valid j's is max(0, (n - (k+3) +1)), where n is the length of s. Sum this over all i.

So to implement this, we need to:

- Precompute the list of starts.

- For each i, find the first k in starts that is >=i. This can be done efficiently using binary search, as the starts are in increasing order.

The steps are:

For the string s:

- Preprocess the list of starts by scanning s from left to right, checking each position k where k+3 < len(s), and s[k] to s[k+3] are 'b', 'e', 'a', 'r'.

Once we have the list starts, which is sorted, we can for each i, perform a binary search to find the first k >=i.

If such a k exists, then the number of j's is max(0, len(s) - (k+3) +1) = max(0, len(s) -k -3 +1) = max(0, len(s) -k -2).

Sum all these values for all i where such a k exists.

Now, the question is: what is the time complexity?

Let's say the length of s is n (up to 5000). The list starts can be built in O(n) time. For each of the n i's, we perform a binary search on the list starts, which is O(m) where m is the number of starts (up to n/4). Binary search is O(log m) per i. So total time is O(n log m), which for n=5e3 is acceptable.

This approach should work within the time constraints.

Now, let's think about the code.

First, find all starts:

starts = []
for k in range(len(s)-3):
    if s[k] == 'b' and s[k+1] == 'e' and s[k+2] == 'a' and s[k+3] == 'r':
        starts.append(k)

Then, for each i in 0..n-1:

We need to find the first k in starts that is >=i.

In Python, the bisect module can help. bisect_left finds the first index in the list where the element is >=i. So:

from bisect import bisect_left

total =0

n = len(s)
for i in range(n):
    idx = bisect_left(starts, i)
    if idx < len(starts):
        k = starts[idx]
        j_min = k +3
        if j_min < n:
            # number of j's is n - j_min
            # because j can be j_min to n-1
            # which is (n-1 - j_min +1) = n -j_min
            count = n - j_min
            total += count
        else:
            # j_min >=n, so no j's
            pass
    else:
        # no such k >=i
        pass

So in code:

import bisect

s = input().strip()
n = len(s)
starts = []
for k in range(n -3):
    if s[k] == 'b' and s[k+1] == 'e' and s[k+2] == 'a' and s[k+3] == 'r':
        starts.append(k)

total =0
for i in range(n):
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, i)
    if idx < len(starts):
        k = starts[idx]
        j_min = k +3
        if j_min >=n:
            continue
        count = n - j_min
        total += count
print(total)

Testing this code with sample 1:

Sample1 input: "bearbtear" (n=9)

starts is [0]. For i in 0..8:

i=0: idx=0. k=0. j_min=3. count=9-3=6.

i=1: idx=0 (since starts[0] is 0 <1). starts is length 1, so idx=1 >=len(starts) (1 >=1 is no). So no contribution.

So sum is 6. Correct.

Sample2 input: "bearaabearc" (n=11)

starts is [0,6]. 

Loop for i from 0 to10:

i=0: idx=0. k=0. j_min=3. count=11-3=8. total=8.

i=1: bisect_left([0,6],1) is 1. k=6. j_min=9. count=11-9=2.

i=2: same as i=1. count=2.

i=3: same. count=2.

i=4: same. count=2.

i=5: same. count=2.

i=6: bisect_left([0,6],6) is 1. k=6. j_min=9. count=11-9=2.

i=7: bisect_left([0,6],7) is 2 (len starts is 2, so no). no contribution.

i=8-10: no.

sum is 8 + 2*5 +2 = 8+10+2=20. Correct.

So this code should work.

Thus, this is the correct approach.
