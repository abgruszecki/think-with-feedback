<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the number of pairs of positions in a such that swapping the bits at those positions changes the bitwise OR of a and b. Hmm.

First, let's understand what the bitwise OR between a and b is. For each bit position i, if either a[i] or b[i] is 1, then the OR's i-th bit is 1. Otherwise, it's 0. Now, swapping two bits in a can affect the OR only if at least one of the swapped bits is in a position where the original OR was determined by a's bit. Otherwise, if in a position i, b[i] is 1, then even if a's bit changes, the OR's bit there will still be 1. So those positions might not contribute to changing the OR when swapped.

So, the key is to identify positions where the original OR is determined by a. That is, for a position i, if b[i] is 0. Because then, the OR at i is exactly a[i]. So any swap that affects such positions could potentially change the OR.

Let me break it down. Let's consider each bit position i:

- If b[i] is 1: then the OR at i is always 1, regardless of a's bit. Changing a[i] here (like swapping it with another) won't affect the OR here. So such positions are not useful for changing the OR when swapped unless another position involved in the swap is in a b[j] = 0 area.

Wait, swapping two bits in a: positions i and j. So after swapping, the OR at i and j may change. Let's see:

Original OR at i is c_i = a[i] | b[i], and at j, c_j = a[j] | b[j].

After swapping, new a's bits are swapped. So new OR at i is (a[j] | b[i]), and at j is (a[i] | b[j]).

The overall OR of a and b will change if at least one of these two new OR values is different from the original c_i and c_j.

So the swap will affect the OR if either (a[j] | b[i]) != c_i OR (a[i] | b[j]) != c_j.

But the original c_i is a[i] | b[i], and c_j is a[j] | b[j].

So let's think for each possible pair (i,j) what happens.

But considering all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is impossible for n up to 1e5. So we need a smarter way.

The total number of possible swaps is n*(n-1)/2. But we need to count only those swaps that cause the OR to change.

So how can we model this?

Let me think about the conditions under which swapping i and j in a will not change the OR.

The swap will not affect the OR if, for both positions i and j, after the swap, the OR remains the same as before.

So for the OR to remain the same after swapping, the following must hold:

At position i: (a[j] | b[i]) == c_i (which is a[i] | b[i])

At position j: (a[i] | b[j]) == c_j (which is a[j] | b[j])

If both conditions are true, then the OR remains the same. Otherwise, the swap contributes to the answer.

So our task is to count all pairs (i,j) where at least one of the two conditions is not met. Then subtract those pairs where both conditions are met from the total possible pairs to get the answer.

But how do we compute the number of pairs that do not contribute (i.e., those that leave the OR unchanged), then subtract that from the total possible pairs?

The total possible pairs is total_swaps = n*(n-1)//2.

The answer will be total_swaps - number_of_unchanged_pairs.

So now the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (i,j) where swapping i and j in a leaves the OR unchanged.

So how do we compute that?

Let's model the conditions for a swap (i,j) to leave the OR unchanged.

Condition 1: a[j] | b[i] == c_i (original OR at i)

But c_i is a[i] | b[i]. So:

a[j] | b[i] must equal a[i] | b[i].

Similarly, condition 2: a[i] | b[j] must equal a[j] | b[j].

So for the swap to not change the OR, both conditions must hold.

We need to find the number of pairs (i,j) where both conditions are satisfied.

So, let's first compute for each i:

c_i = a[i] | b[i].

Now, for the swap (i,j), the new OR at i is a[j] | b[i], which must equal c_i. Similarly, new OR at j is a[i] | b[j], which must equal c_j.

So, we can split the problem into four cases based on the values of b[i] and b[j], and a[i] and a[j].

Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.

Let's consider possible scenarios for positions i and j.

Case 1: Both b[i] and b[j] are 1.

In this case, the original OR at i and j is 1, since a's bits OR with 1 gives 1.

After swapping a[i] and a[j], the OR at i is a[j] | 1 = 1, same as before. Similarly, OR at j is a[i] | 1 = 1. So in this case, the swap does not change the OR. So all swaps between positions where both b[i] and b[j] are 1 will not affect the OR. Therefore, any pair (i,j) where b[i] and b[j] are 1 will not contribute to the answer. So these pairs are part of the 'unchanged_pairs' count.

Case 2: b[i] is 1, b[j] is 0.

Then, original c_i is 1 (since b[i] is 1), and c_j is a[j] | 0 = a[j].

After swap:

OR at i is a[j] | 1 = 1 (same as before), so condition 1 holds.

OR at j is a[i] | 0 = a[i]. This must equal c_j (a[j]). So for condition 2 to hold: a[i] must equal a[j].

So if b[i] is 1 and b[j] is 0, then the swap (i,j) will not change the OR only if a[i] == a[j].

So in this case, the pair (i,j) is counted in unchanged_pairs only if a[i] == a[j].

Similarly, if i and j are in this case (b[i] is 1, b[j] is 0), then the swap is allowed to be in the unchanged set only if a[i] and a[j] are the same.

Case 3: b[i] is 0, b[j] is 1.

This is symmetric to case 2. The OR at i after swap is a[j] | 0 = a[j], which must equal original c_i (a[i] | 0 = a[i]). So condition 1 is a[j] == a[i]. OR at j is a[i] | 1 =1, which equals original c_j (1). So condition 2 is automatically satisfied. So for the swap (i,j) in this case (b[i] is 0, b[j] is 1), the pair is in the unchanged set if a[i] == a[j].

Case 4: Both b[i] and b[j] are 0.

Original c_i = a[i], c_j = a[j].

After swapping, OR at i is a[j], which must equal a[i]. OR at j is a[i], which must equal a[j]. So, condition 1 is a[j] == a[i], condition 2 is a[i] == a[j]. So both conditions are equivalent to a[i] == a[j]. So in this case, the swap (i,j) is in the unchanged set if a[i] == a[j].

So, to sum up:

The pair (i,j) contributes to unchanged_pairs if:

- Both b[i] and b[j] are 1. OR:

- One of b[i] or b[j] is 1 and the other is 0, and a[i] == a[j]. OR:

- Both b[i] and b[j] are 0, and a[i] == a[j].

So, the problem is to count all such pairs.

Now, how to compute this efficiently.

Let me think of categorizing each position into different types based on the values of b and a.

Let's categorize each index i into a type based on (b[i], a[i]).

But perhaps we can precompute counts for different combinations.

Let's consider different groups:

Group 1: b[i] = 1. Then, regardless of a[i], any swap between two positions in this group will not change the OR (as in case 1).

Group 2: b[i] = 0. Then, when paired with another j where b[j] is 0, a[i] must equal a[j]. Also, when paired with j where b[j] is 1, a[i] must equal a[j].

Wait, no. Wait, when j is in group1 (b[j]=1), then i is in group2 (b[i]=0). So the swap (i,j) will be in case 2 or 3. For such pairs, the condition is that a[i] == a[j].

So, the pairs (i,j) where one is in group1 and the other in group2 are counted in unchanged_pairs only if a[i] == a[j].

Similarly, pairs within group2 are counted in unchanged_pairs only if a[i] == a[j].

So, the total number of unchanged_pairs is:

number of pairs within group1 (all possible pairs, since all are allowed) + 

number of pairs within group2 where a[i] == a[j] + 

number of pairs between group1 and group2 where a[i] == a[j].

Hmm. Let's formalize this.

Let:

count_1 = number of positions where b[i] is 1.

count_0 = number of positions where b[i] is 0. (count_0 = n - count_1)

Within group1 (b=1), the number of pairs is C(count_1, 2).

Within group2 (b=0), the number of pairs where a[i] == a[j] is:

sum over each a value of C(k, 2), where k is the number of positions in group2 with a[i] = that value.

For example, if in group2, there are x zeros and y ones, then it's C(x,2) + C(y, 2).

Additionally, pairs between group1 and group2 where a[i] == a[j]. For these, each such pair (i in group1, j in group2) contributes 1 if a[i] == a[j]. So the total is (number of group1 elements with a=0) * (number of group2 elements with a=0) + (number of group1 elements with a=1) * (number of group2 elements with a=1).

So, putting this together:

unchanged_pairs = C(count_1, 2) + (C(x0, 2) + C(x1, 2)) + (g1_0 * g0_0 + g1_1 * g0_1 )

Where:

x0 is the number of group2 elements (b=0) with a=0.

x1 is the number of group2 elements (b=0) with a=1.

g1_0: number of group1 elements (b=1) with a=0.

g1_1: group1 elements (b=1) with a=1.

g0_0: group0 elements (b=0) with a=0.

g0_1: group0 elements (b=0) with a=1.

So the steps to compute this are:

1. Precompute count_1 (number of b[i] = 1).

2. Precompute for group1: count how many have a=0 (g1_0) and a=1 (g1_1).

3. Precompute for group0 (b=0):

   a. x0 (a=0) and x1 (a=1).

4. Compute C(count_1, 2) which is count_1 * (count_1-1) // 2.

5. Compute the group0 internal pairs: C(x0,2) + C(x1,2).

6. Compute cross pairs between group1 and group0 where a[i] == a[j]: (g1_0 * x0) + (g1_1 * x1).

So adding all these gives the total unchanged_pairs.

Once we have this, the answer is total_swaps - unchanged_pairs.

The total_swaps is n*(n-1)//2.

So the steps are:

- For each position, classify into group1 or group0.

- For group1, count the a bits.

- For group0, count the a bits (x0 and x1).

Then compute all the components as above.

Let me test this logic against the sample input.

First sample:

n=5

a=01011 → [0,1,0,1,1]

b=11001 → [1,1,0,0,1]

So group1 (b=1) are positions where b[i] is 1.

Looking at b:

b is 1,1,0,0,1 → positions 0,1,4 are group1 (count_1=3).

group0 (b=0) are positions 2,3 (count_0=2).

For group1:

a in those positions (0,1,1) → a=0 (position 0), a=1 (positions 1 and 4).

So g1_0 =1, g1_1=2.

group0's a values: positions 2 and 3. a[2]=0, a[3]=1 → x0=1, x1=1.

Compute:

C(count_1,2) = 3*2/2=3.

group0 internal pairs: C(1,2) + C(1,2) → 0 +0=0.

cross pairs: (g1_0 * x0) + (g1_1 * x1) → (1*1) + (2*1) = 1+2=3.

So unchanged_pairs = 3 + 0 + 3 = 6.

Total swaps: 5*4/2=10.

Answer is 10-6=4. Which matches the first sample. Great.

Second sample:

n=6

a=011000 → [0,1,1,0,0,0]

b=010011 → [0,1,0,0,1,1]

group1 (b=1) are positions where b[i] is 1: positions 1,4,5 (count_1=3).

group0: positions 0,2,3 (since b is 0,0,0,0,1,1 → wait no, wait original b is "010011".

Wait, let's recheck:

b is 0,1,0,0,1,1 → group1 is positions 1,4,5 (indices 0-based? I think the problem uses 0-based or 1-based? The sample notes mention indexes (1,4) etc., which may be 1-based. But in the code, when we process the input, the positions are 0-based.

But in any case, the actual code will process the input as strings.

So in the second sample:

b is '010011' → for each position:

index 0: '0' → group0.

index 1: '1' → group1.

index2: '0' → group0.

index3: '0' → group0.

index4: '1' → group1.

index5: '1' → group1.

So group1 has count_1 =3 (positions 1,4,5).

group0 has count_0=3 (positions 0,2,3).

In group1, the a's bits are:

a is '011000' → indices 1: '1', 4: '0',5: '0' → group1 a values: 1,0,0 → g1_0 =2, g1_1=1.

group0's a bits: positions 0,2,3 → a is 0,1,0 → x0=2 (since a is 0 in positions 0 and 3?), x1=1 (position2 is 1).

So group0 has x0=2 (a=0) and x1=1 (a=1).

Now compute:

C(count_1,2) =3*2/2=3.

group0 internal pairs: C(2,2) + C(1,2) → 1 +0=1.

cross pairs: (g1_0 * x0) + (g1_1 * x1) → 2*2 (g1_0=2, x0=2) → 4, plus 1*1 (g1_1=1, x1=1) →1. Total 5.

So unchanged_pairs =3 +1 +5=9.

Total_swaps =6*5/2=15.

Answer is 15-9=6. Which matches the sample.

Great. So the logic works for the samples.

Now, let's code this.

The steps:

1. Read n, a, b.

2. For each i in 0..n-1:

   a. Check if b[i] is '1' → group1.

   else → group0.

3. For group1:

   count_1 is the number of '1's in b.

   Also, count the number of group1 elements with a[i] '0' (g1_0) and '1' (g1_1).

4. For group0:

   count the number of '0's and '1's in a[i] → x0 and x1.

5. Compute all components.

Let's code this.

In Python:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    a = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    b = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    count_1 = 0

    g1_0 = 0

    g1_1 = 0

    x0 = 0

    x1 = 0

    for ai, bi in zip(a, b):

        if bi == '1':

            count_1 +=1

            if ai == '0':

                g1_0 +=1

            else:

                g1_1 +=1

        else:

            if ai == '0':

                x0 +=1

            else:

                x1 +=1

    # Compute unchanged_pairs

    unchanged = 0

    # group1 internal pairs

    unchanged += count_1 * (count_1 -1) // 2

    # group0 internal pairs where a is same

    unchanged += (x0 * (x0 -1) //2) + (x1 * (x1 -1) //2)

    # cross pairs between group1 and group0 where a is same

    unchanged += (g1_0 * x0) + (g1_1 * x1)

    total_swaps = n * (n-1) //2

    answer = total_swaps - unchanged

    print(answer, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')

    test()


```

Sample 2:

a='011000', b='010011'

Loop:

i=0: a=0, b=0 → group0. ai=0 →x0 +=1.

i=1: a=1, b=1 → group1. ai=1 →g1_1 +=1. count_1=1.

i=2: a=1, b=0 → group0. ai=1 →x1 +=1.

i=3: a=0, b=0 → group0. ai=0 →x0 +=1.

i=4: a=0, b=1 → group1. ai=0 →g1_0 +=1. count_1=2.

i=5: a=0, b=1 → group1. ai=0 →g1_0 +=1. count_1=3.

So group1_0=2, group1_1=1.

x0=2 (i=0,3), x1=1 (i=2).

group1 internal pairs:3*2//2=3.

group0 internal: (2 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) →1 +0=1.

cross pairs: 2*2 (g1_0 *x0) →4, plus 1*1 (g1_1 *x1) →1. total 5.

unchanged=3+1+5=9. total_swaps=6*5//2=15. 15-9=6.

Correct.

So the code works.

Now, edge cases. For example:

All b's are 1: then all pairs are in group1, so unchanged_pairs is C(n,2). So answer is 0.

Another case: all b's are 0. Then, the swap (i,j) is in unchanged_pairs only if a[i] ==a[j]. So the answer is total_swaps - (C(x0,2)+C(x1,2)), where x0 and x1 are counts of 0 and 1 in a.

Another example: n=2, a=01, b=00.

original OR is 0 |0 =0 and 1|0=1 → OR is 01.

After swapping, a becomes 10. OR is 10. So the OR is same as before. So answer is 0.

But according to code:

group0: all positions (since b is 00).

x0: how many a's are 0 in group0. a is '0' and '1' → x0=1, x1=1.

group0 internal pairs: (1*0//2) + (1*0//2) →0. So unchanged_pairs=0+0=0.

Wait, group0 internal pairs are C(1,2) + C(1,2) =0+0=0.

cross pairs: since group1 is empty, so 0.

unchanged_pairs=0. total_swaps=1. answer=1-0=1. But in reality, swapping the two bits would result in a OR which is same as before. So the code gives 1, but correct answer is 0.

Wait, wait, that's a problem. What's wrong here.

Wait in the example: a=01, b=00.

Original OR is a OR b: 01 | 00 → 01.

After swapping a's bits, a becomes 10. OR with b (00) is 10. So the OR is 10. Which is different from original 01. So the answer should be 1.

But according to code:

unchanged_pairs is the number of pairs (i,j) that when swapped, the OR remains the same. So for this case, group0 is all positions (since b is 00).

group0: x0 is the number of a's 0's (1), x1 is 1 (a's 1).

group0 internal pairs: (i,j) where a[i] == a[j].

In group0, the pairs (0,1) is a swap between a=0 and a=1. So a[i] != a[j], so swapping them would change the OR.

Thus, the code would compute group0 internal unchanged pairs as 0 (since x0=1 and x1=1, C(1,2) + C(1,2) =0). So unchanged_pairs is 0.

Total swaps is 2*1//2=1. So answer is 1-0=1. Which is correct. So the code works here.

But in reality, swapping i=0 and i=1 (a=0 and 1), the new OR is 10, which is different from original 01. So the code correctly counts this as a valid swap (so answer is 1). So the code is correct.

Another example: n=2, a=00, b=00.

original OR is 00. After swapping, a remains 00. So OR is same. So answer is 0.

code:

group0 is all positions.

x0=2, x1=0.

group0 internal pairs: C(2,2) + C(0,2) =1 +0=1.

unchanged_pairs=1.

total_swaps=1. answer=1-1=0. Correct.

Another example: n=3, a=011, b=101.

But maybe better to think through.

So the code seems correct.

Thus, the code should work.
