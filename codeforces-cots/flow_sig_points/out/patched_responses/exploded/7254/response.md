Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to determine the winner between Koyomi and Karen based on the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where xi XOR yj is present in the combined set of all 2n integers. The winner is Karen if the count is even, otherwise Koyomi.

First, let's think about the approach. The problem requires checking for each (xi, yj) pair whether xi XOR yj is in the combined set S of x's and y's. Then, count how many such pairs exist and determine if it's even or odd.

The constraints are n up to 2000. So the total possible pairs are 2000 * 2000 = 4,000,000. For each pair, we need to check if the XOR result is present in the set. The checking needs to be O(1) to handle 4 million operations efficiently. So, the first thing is to store all elements in a set for quick lookups.

But even with O(1) lookups, 4 million operations are manageable, right? Let's see. For each of the 4 million pairs, compute XOR and check in a set. That should be feasible within 1 second. Because Python can handle millions of operations in a reasonable time.

But wait, 4 million is 4e6. Let's think: each iteration involves a XOR (fast) and a set lookup (also O(1)). So, 4e6 iterations, each taking maybe a few nanoseconds. That's acceptable. But let's confirm. For Python, even 1e8 operations would be too slow, but 4e6 is manageable.

So the plan is:

1. Read all x and y values.
2. Create a set containing all x and y values.
3. For each xi in x's, and each yj in y's, compute xi ^ yj. Check if it's in the set.
4. Count the total number of such pairs.
5. If the count is even, Karen wins. Else, Koyomi.

But wait, n can be 2000. So 2000*2000 = 4,000,000. For each pair, check if the XOR is in the set.

But the problem states that all 2n integers are distinct. So the set will have exactly 2n elements.

Now, the problem is to compute the count efficiently.

But how to handle this in Python? Let's outline the steps.

First, read n. Then read the two lines as lists x and y. Then create a set S that combines x and y. Then initialize a count variable. Then loop over all xi in x, and yj in y. For each pair, compute xi ^ yj. If the result is in S, increment the count.

Once the count is obtained, check if it's even or odd, and output the winner accordingly.

But wait, even with 4 million iterations, this should be okay. Let's see. For Python, each iteration is a few operations. Let's do a rough calculation. Suppose each iteration takes 100 nanoseconds (which is a very rough estimate). 4e6 * 100e-9 seconds = 0.4 seconds. But Python is slower than that. For example, a loop in Python might take about 0.1 seconds per million iterations, depending on what's inside. So 4e6 iterations with a XOR and a set lookup might take around 0.4 seconds. But we have to account for the set lookup.

In Python, checking if an element is in a set is O(1), but the actual time depends on the size of the set and the hashing. For 4000 elements, the set is small, so lookups should be fast.

Wait, 2n can be up to 4000 elements. So the set has 4000 elements. Each lookup is O(1), but the actual time for each lookup is negligible.

So the total time for the nested loops would be acceptable.

But wait, in Python, nested loops (for i in x, for j in y) would take O(nÂ²) time. For n=2000, that's 4 million iterations. Let's think about how to make this as efficient as possible.

So, the steps in code would be:

Read n.

Read x list as integers.

Read y list as integers.

Create a set S = set(x) | set(y).

Initialize count = 0.

Then, for each xi in x:

    for each yj in y:

        if (xi ^ yj) in S:

            count += 1

Then, check if count is even. Output Karen if even, else Koyomi.

But in Python, loops can be slow. So for n=2000, the loops would be 2000 * 2000 = 4e6 iterations. Let's see: how much time does that take in Python?

Each iteration: compute the XOR, check in the set. In Python, the XOR is a single operation, and the set lookup is a single check. But looping in pure Python might be slow.

Alternative approach: use list comprehensions or generators to make it faster, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, precompute all possible XORs and check against the set. But it's the same as the nested loops.

Another idea: precompute all possible xi ^ yj and check if they are in S. But the way to generate all pairs is the same as nested loops.

Hmm. So, perhaps the code as written is acceptable, but for n=2000, 4 million iterations in Python might be tight for the 1 second time limit.

Wait, in Python, 1e6 loops take about 0.1 seconds (depending on the operations inside). So 4e6 would take 0.4 seconds. Add the XOR and the set check, maybe that's 1e6 loops take 0.2 seconds, leading to 0.8 seconds for 4e6. Which is under 1 second. So perhaps this approach is feasible.

But let's think of possible optimizations.

Alternative approach: convert the set into a hash set (which it already is), and precompute all possible XORs. But that's what the code is already doing.

Wait, another thing: the problem requires that all 2n numbers are distinct. So S has exactly 2n elements.

But how can xi XOR yj be equal to one of the 2n elements?

But that's exactly what the problem requires.

Another possible optimization: precompute the set as a Python set, which has O(1) lookups. So the code as written is correct.

But in Python, nested loops can be slow. Let's think of using itertools.product to generate all pairs. For example:

from itertools import product

count = 0
s = set_x_union_y
for a, b in product(x, y):
    if (a ^ b) in s:
        count +=1

But itertools.product might be faster than nested loops, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using list comprehensions and sum. For example:

count = sum( (a ^ b) in s for a in x for b in y )

But that's a generator expression, and sum would add up all the True (1) and False (0) values. But this is a single line, but would it be faster?

In Python, list comprehensions and generator expressions are generally faster than explicit loops. So maybe using that would save time.

So, the code could be written as:

s = set(x) | set(y)
count = sum( (a ^ b) in s for a in x for b in y )

Then, output based on count % 2.

But even this may not be faster than the nested loops. Let's see.

In any case, the code has to be written as efficiently as possible. So perhaps using the generator expression with sum is better.

Another thing to consider: converting the set into a frozenset, but that probably doesn't make a difference.

Alternatively, precompute a set of integers and use that for lookups.

So, the code could look like:

n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = set(x) | set(y)
count = 0
for a in x:
    ax = a
    for b in y:
        if (ax ^ b) in s:
            count += 1
print("Karen" if count % 2 == 0 else "Koyomi")

But again, for n=2000, this is 4e6 loops. Let's see how long this would take in Python.

Let's test with some example.

The first example input:

3

1 2 3

4 5 6

The code should compute 6 pairs. So in this case, the code would generate 3*3=9 pairs. For each pair, compute XOR. For example, 1^4=5 (which is in the set?), 1^5=4 (which is in the set?), etc.

Wait, the combined set is {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So 1^4 is 5 (which is in the set). So (1,4) is a valid pair. Similarly, 1^5 is 4 (in the set). So (1,5) is valid. So for the first example, the code would count 6 pairs.

So the code works.

But what about the time for n=2000? Let's see.

In Python, each iteration is a loop. Let's think about the time.

Another possible optimization is to precompute the set once, and use local variables for the loops. Because in Python, looking up variables in the global scope can be slower than in local scope.

So, modifying the code to make the set a local variable. For example:

def main():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set(x) | set(y)
    count = 0
    for a in x:
        for b in y:
            if (a ^ b) in s:
                count += 1
    print("Karen" if count % 2 ==0 else "Koyomi")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This way, s is a local variable inside the function, which might be accessed faster. Also, using a function can sometimes speed up Python code because variables are accessed more quickly in the local scope.

Another possible optimization is to precompute the y list and x list as tuples or something else, but probably not.

Another idea: using a bitset for the set. But in Python, the set is already efficient for lookups.

Alternatively, use a bitmask if the numbers are small. But the numbers can be up to 2e6, so a bitmask would require 2e6 bits, which is about 250KB. But checking whether a number is in the set would then be a bit check. However, in Python, bitmask operations can be tricky. Also, the set approach is probably better here.

So the code as written is correct and as efficient as possible.

Another possible optimization: precompute all the y elements and x elements, and then loop through them in a way that is as fast as possible.

Alternatively, for each a in x, precompute a ^ b for all b in y, and check each against the set. But that's the same as the original approach.

Another thing to note is that the order of loops (x then y) doesn't affect the total count. So the code is correct.

Now, what about the maximum memory usage? The set will contain 4000 elements (for n=2000). Each integer is up to 2e6, so the memory required is negligible. So the code is within the memory constraints.

So the code seems to be correct and efficient enough.

Now, test the second example:

Input:

5

2 4 6 8 10

9 7 5 3 1

The combined set is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

The code counts 16 pairs, which is even. So output is Karen.

So the code works.

Now, the code should work for all test cases, and with the given constraints, it should be efficient enough.

But wait, in Python, the for loops for 2000x2000=4e6 iterations may take too long. Let's think: in Python, a loop with 4e6 iterations, each doing a few operations.

In Python, each loop iteration is relatively slow. For example, a loop that does nothing but loop over 4e6 elements would take about 0.4 seconds. But when each iteration involves a XOR and a set check, it's possible that the code may take more than 1 second.

So perhaps we need a faster approach.

Alternative approach: precompute all the elements in a set, and for each pair (xi, yj), compute the XOR and check if it's in the set. But the same as the original code.

Hmm. What's the time complexity here? O(nÂ²) time. For n=2000, that's 4e6 operations. So even in Python, with each iteration taking a few operations, the code may pass.

But to optimize, perhaps using a generator expression with sum is faster, as it's implemented in C.

So, the code could be rewritten as:

s = set(x) | set(y)
count = sum( (a ^ b) in s for a in x for b in y )

This way, the entire computation is done in a generator expression, which is handled more efficiently by Python's internal optimizations.

So the code would look like:

n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))
s = set(x + y)
count = sum( (a ^ b) in s for a in x for b in y )
print("Karen" if count % 2 == 0 else "Koyomi")

Wait, wait. Wait, x and y are lists of n elements each. So set(x + y) is the same as the union of x and y. So the code is correct.

Using this approach, the sum is computed by iterating through all pairs, and for each, checking if the XOR is in s. Each check returns a boolean (True/False), which is treated as 1 or 0. Summing all these gives the total count.

In Python, this is likely faster than explicit loops with a count variable because the loop is handled in C code rather than Python bytecode. So this may save a lot of time.

For example, for 4e6 iterations, a generator expression in sum may be executed much faster than a Python for loop.

So this code is better optimized for speed.

Thus, this is the code that should be used.

Let me test this approach.

In the first example, sum would be 6, which is correct. In the second example, sum is 16. So code is correct.

So the code is correct and efficient.

Now, considering that the code uses sum with a generator expression, which is handled efficiently, the code should run within the time constraints.

Another possible optimization: precompute the set once and use a local variable. Since the code is inside a function, which is not the case here. But even if it's not in a function, the set is a local variable in the code.

So the code should work.

So the code is as follows:

Read n, read x and y.

Create s as the union of x and y.

Sum over all a in x, b in y: 1 if (a^b) is in s else 0.

Check if the sum is even or odd, and output the winner.

Thus, the code is correct and optimized.
