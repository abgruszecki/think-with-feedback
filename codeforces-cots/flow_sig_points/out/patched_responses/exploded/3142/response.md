Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of snooze presses y such that when you subtract x*y minutes from the given time hh:mm, the resulting time contains a digit '7'. And y has to be non-negative. The answer is the smallest possible y.

Hmm. So the approach here is probably to check for each possible y (starting from 0 upwards) whether the time (hh:mm - x*y minutes) has a 7 in any digit of the hours or minutes. The first such y we find is the answer.

But how do we efficiently compute this? The maximum possible x is 60, and the time could be up to 23:59. Let's think about the maximum possible y we might need to check. Since each step is x minutes back, and the maximum possible steps before cycling through all possible times is up to the LCM of x and 1440 (since there are 1440 minutes in a day). But since the alarm can be set days before, we need to check all possible times that are x*y minutes before the given time. But since the time loops every 1440 minutes, we can compute the possible times modulo 1440.

Wait, but how far back do we need to check? Since the time loops every 1440 minutes, after subtracting 1440 minutes, we're back to the same time. So for each possible y, the time after subtracting x*y minutes can be considered modulo 1440. But since x can be up to 60, and 1440 is divisible by x when x is a divisor of 60 (like 60, 30, etc.), but not in all cases. So maybe the maximum number of steps we need to check is up to 1440 / gcd(x, 1440), which could be as high as 1440 if x and 1440 are coprime. But 1440 is 24*60 = 24*60. The GCD of x and 1440. Let's see: For x=1, the GCD is 1, so 1440 steps. For x=60, the GCD is 60, so 1440/60=24 steps. So the maximum steps would be 1440 steps. But 1440 is manageable for a loop, right? Because even 1e4 iterations are manageable in Python. So we can loop y from 0 upwards and check each possible time.

So the algorithm is:

For y in 0, 1, 2, ...:

- Compute the time that is x*y minutes before the given time.

- Check if that time has a '7' in any digit (hours or minutes).

- The first y for which this is true is the answer.

But how do we compute the time x*y minutes before hh:mm?

Let's convert the original time to total minutes since 00:00. Then subtract x*y, then take modulo 1440 (since 1440 is the number of minutes in a day). Then convert back to hours and minutes.

So for example, the original time is hh * 60 + mm minutes. Let's call this total = hh*60 + mm.

Then, for each y, compute (total - x*y) mod 1440. Then convert this back to hours and minutes.

Then check if either the hours (as two digits) or the minutes (as two digits) contain a 7.

So the steps would be:

1. Read x, hh, mm.

2. Compute total = hh * 60 + mm.

3. For y in 0, 1, 2, ...:

   a. Compute time = (total - x * y) % 1440. If x*y is larger than total, subtracting gives a negative number, but mod 1440 will wrap around.

   b. Convert time back to hours and minutes: new_hh = time // 60, new_mm = time % 60.

   c. Check if new_hh has a digit '7' (since new_hh can be 0-23, need to check both digits, even if it's a single digit. Wait, but in the problem statement, the time is considered as two-digit. For example, 07:00 is allowed. So new_hh can be 7 (07) or 17 (17), etc. Similarly, new_mm can be 07, 37, etc. So, for the hours part, even if the hour is 7 (which is 07 in two digits), the digit '7' is present.

Wait, when the problem says "the time representation of the time xÂ·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'", the time is represented in 24-hour format, with leading zeros for hours and minutes. For example, 7:5 would be 07:05, which contains a 7 in the hour's first digit. So when converting new_hh and new_mm to two digits (with leading zeros if necessary), check if any digit is '7'.

So for each time, check the two digits of the hour and the two digits of the minute.

So for new_hh, format it as two digits. For example, 5 becomes '05', which doesn't have a 7. But 7 becomes '07', which has a 7. Similarly, 17 is '17', which has 7 as the second digit.

So steps for checking:

- Format new_hh as two digits (with leading zero if necessary) into a string.

- Format new_mm as two digits.

- Concatenate the two strings (or check each separately) and see if any character is '7'.

So for example, if new_hh is 7, new_mm is 30: the hour part is '07', which has a 7. So yes.

So the checking function is straightforward.

Now, the key is to iterate y starting from 0 upwards, compute the time for each y, and check if any of the digits is '7'. The first such y is the answer.

Now, what's the maximum possible y we need to check?

Well, the worst case is when we have to check until the time loops back to the original time. Since the time is modulo 1440, x*y can be up to 1440 steps. Because after 1440 steps, x*y would be 1440 * x. But modulo 1440, x*y mod 1440 cycles. Wait, but for each y, the time steps back by x minutes. So the possible times are (total - x*y) mod 1440. So y can be from 0 to (1440-1) because after that, the (x*y) mod 1440 would start repeating. So, for example, if x is 1, then x*y cycles through all possible mod 1440 residues. So to cover all possible residues, y could be up to 1439. Because 1440 *1 =1440, mod 1440 is 0, so y=1440 would give the same as y=0. So in the worst case, y can go up to 1439. But since x can be up to 60, the maximum number of steps is 1440 steps. But even that is manageable.

Wait, for x=60, the maximum steps would be 24 (since 60*24=1440). So for each possible y in 0 to 23, then 24 steps would loop.

So for the algorithm, we can loop y from 0 to (1440-1), and for each y, compute the time. Check if any of the digits is 7. The first y where this is true is the answer.

But why 1440 steps? Because after that, the times would start repeating.

So the maximum number of steps needed is 1440. Since 1440 is manageable (each step is a simple calculation), even in Python, this would be fast enough.

So the plan is:

Read x, hh, mm.

Compute total = hh *60 + mm.

For y in 0, 1, 2, ... up to 1440:

   compute time = (total - x * y) % 1440.

   h = time //60

   m = time %60

   check if any digit in h (as two digits) is '7' or any digit in m (as two digits) is '7'.

   if yes, return y.

So since the problem states that there is a solution, we can loop until we find the first y.

Now, the code.

But how to format h and m as two digits with leading zeros?

In Python, we can format as:

h_str = f"{h:02d}"

m_str = f"{m:02d}"

Then check if '7' is in h_str or m_str.

So the code:

Read x.

Read hh and mm.

total = hh*60 + mm.

for y in 0 to ...:

   time = (total - x*y) % 1440

   h = time //60

   m = time %60

   h_str = f"{h:02d}"

   m_str = f"{m:02d}"

   if '7' in h_str or '7' in m_str:

       print(y)

       exit()

Since the problem says that there is a solution, this loop will terminate.

Now, in code:

In Python:

x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

total = hh * 60 + mm

for y in range(1440):  # since after 1440 steps, it would have cycled

    current_time = (total - x * y) % 1440

    h = current_time // 60

    m = current_time % 60

    hh_str = f"{h:02d}"

    mm_str = f"{m:02d}"

    if '7' in hh_str or '7' in mm_str:

        print(y)

        exit()

Wait, but why 1440? Because in the worst case, you might have to check all possible times. For example, if x=1, and the only possible time with a 7 is 1440 steps back, which is the same as the original time. Wait, but maybe not. Let's see: Suppose x=1, and the original time is 00:00. Then, subtracting 1*y minutes. The first time with a 7 would be 00:07 (y=53? Wait, 00:07 is 7 minutes after 00:00, but subtracting 53 steps would be 00:00 -53*1 = -53 minutes, which is 23:07. So y=53 would give 23:07, which has a 7. So in that case, y is 53.

But in the worst case, when x is 1, the maximum y could be up to 1439 steps, but after 1440 steps, the time cycles. So the loop can be up to 1440 steps. Because in the worst case, the first occurrence of a 7 is after 1439 steps. But since the problem states that there is at least one solution, the loop will find it within 1440 steps.

So in code, looping up to 1440 times is sufficient.

Testing the sample input.

Sample 1:

Input:

3

11 23

total = 11*60 +23= 683.

For y=0: 683 -0 =683. 683 mod 1440 is 683. 683 minutes is 11 h 23 m. Check: 11:23. No 7. So no.

y=1: 683-3=680. 680 minutes is 11*60=660, 20: 680-660=20. 11:20. No.

y=2: 683-6=677. 677//60 = 11 (11*60=660), 677-660=17. 11:17. The minutes are 17, which has a 7. So yes. So y=2 is the answer. Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input: 5 01 07.

total is 1*60 +7=67.

y=0: 67-0=67. 01:07. Which is 07 in minutes. So yes. So output 0.

So code works.

Another example: if the time is 07:00, then y=0 is the answer. If time is 23:59, x=1. Then subtracting 1* y steps. Let's see:

y=0: 23:59. No 7 in 23 or 59. y=1: 23:58. No. ... until y= (23*60 +59 - (7*60 + ...)). Wait, perhaps the first 7 could be in hours. Like, when subtracting 16*60 + ... minutes. For example, subtract 16*60 minutes from 23:59 gives 7:59. So 7:59 would have a 7 in the hour. So y would be 16*60 /x. But x is 1, so y= 16*60=960 steps. But in the code, the loop runs up to 1439 steps, which is sufficient.

But since x can be up to 60, and 960 is less than 1440, the code would find it.

So the code is correct.

Now, to code this in Python.

The code reads x from input, then hh and mm. Then computes total. Then loops y from 0 to 1439 inclusive (since 1440 steps), and for each y, computes current_time, then h and m. Formats as two digits and checks for 7.

Once found, print y and exit.

So code:

x = int(input())
hh, mm = map(int, input().split())
total = hh * 60 + mm

for y in range(1440):
    time = (total - x * y) % 1440
    h = time // 60
    m = time % 60
    if f"{h:02d}{m:02d}".count('7') > 0:
        print(y)
        exit()

But wait, perhaps checking '7' in hh_str or mm_str is more efficient. But in code, f"{h:02d}{m:02d}" combines the two, and checking if any '7' exists.

Alternatively:

h_str = f"{h:02d}"
m_str = f"{m:02d}"
if '7' in h_str or '7' in m_str:

Which is equivalent. The first approach is shorter code, but the second might be slightly more efficient. However, in Python, string concatenation is O(n), but for 4 characters, it's negligible.

But for code brevity, perhaps the first approach is better.

Another optimization: once a y is found, return immediately, so the loop stops.

This code should handle all cases correctly.

Another test case: x=60, hh=07, mm=00. Then y=0 is the answer. But if hh is 08:00, then the time x*y is 60*y minutes. For y=0: 08:00 (no 7). y=1: 08:00 -60=07:00, which has 7. So y=1.

So code would return 1.

Another case: x=60, hh=00, mm=00. Then for y=1: time is 00:00 -60 = 23:00. 23:00: no. y=2: 22:00. ... y=5: 19:00. No. y=7: 17:00. Which has 7. So y=7. So code would find that.

Thus, the code seems correct.

    h, m = divmod(time, 60)
