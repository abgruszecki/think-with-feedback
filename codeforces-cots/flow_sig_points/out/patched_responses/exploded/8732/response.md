Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of string s that is strictly larger than string t. If there's no such permutation, return -1. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the problem correctly. So, the output must be a permutation of s (so same characters, same counts as in s) that is lexicographically greater than t, and among all possible such permutations, choose the smallest one. If it's impossible, output -1.

Let me think about the constraints. Both s and t can be up to 5000 characters long. Oh, that's a problem. Because generating all permutations would be O(n!) which is impossible for n=5000. So brute force is out of the question. We need an efficient approach.

So how to approach this? Let's think of the problem as finding the next permutation of s that is larger than t. But since s is a multiset of characters, the next permutation approach needs to be adjusted.

Wait, but the next permutation method for generating the next lex order permutation is O(n), but that's for unique elements. However, for multisets, the same approach can work with some modifications.

But the main issue here is comparing with t. Because t can be longer or shorter than s, and we need to generate a permutation of s that is lex greater than t. So there's two cases: when s's length is different from t's, and when they are the same.

Wait, the problem says that the output must be a permutation of s. So the length of the output is the same as s. So if s's length is not equal to t's length, then:

- If len(s) > len(t): then any permutation of s is lex greater than t. Because lex order considers the prefix first. For example, if t is "a" (length 1) and s is "aa", then "aa" is longer and thus lex greater. So the minimal permutation here is the lex smallest permutation of s. For s's permutations, the lex smallest is sorted in ascending order.

- If len(s) < len(t): then no permutation can be lex greater than t. Because even the lex largest permutation of s (sorted in descending order) will be shorter, and thus considered lex smaller. So in this case, output -1.

So first, check the lengths. If len(s) < len(t): output -1. If len(s) > len(t), then the minimal permutation is the lex smallest permutation of s (sorted ascending), which is the smallest possible. But wait, we have to make sure that this minimal permutation is indeed larger than t. Wait, but when len(s) > len(t), the minimal permutation of s (sorted) would have length greater than t. So if t is a prefix of s's sorted permutation, then it's possible. Wait, no. For example, if t is "abc" and s is "aabbccd", then the sorted s is "aabbccd", which is longer. So when comparing t (length 3) and s (length 7), the sorted s is lex greater than t because it's longer. So in this case, the answer is sorted(s). So if len(s) > len(t), then the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s (sorted) unless there's a permutation of s that is lex smaller than t and has the same length as s. Wait, no. Because the length is different. Lex order is such that a longer string is considered larger if the prefix up to the shorter's length is the same. So for example, "aab" is smaller than "aabc" because "aab" is a prefix of "aabc" and is shorter. So any permutation of s with len(s) > len(t) will be larger than t. So in that case, the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s.

So the steps are:

1. Check if len(s) < len(t). If yes, output -1.

2. Else if len(s) > len(t): output the lex smallest permutation of s (sorted in ascending order).

3. Else (lengths are equal): find the smallest permutation of s that is lex greater than t. If no such permutation exists, output -1.

So the main problem is case 3. How to handle when lengths are equal.

So the problem reduces to, when len(s) = len(t) = n, find the lex smallest permutation of s that is strictly greater than t. If no such permutation exists, output -1.

Now, how to approach this?

The approach is similar to finding the next lex permutation of s, but in this case, the next permutation must be larger than t. Also, since s can have duplicate characters, we need to handle that.

So, the steps for the case where len(s) = len(t):

We can generate the minimal permutation of s that is larger than t.

This can be done by trying to build the permutation character by character, ensuring that at each step, the current prefix is as small as possible, but such that the entire string can be greater than t.

This is similar to generating the next higher number with certain digits, but with the constraint of having to be larger than a specific target.

Let me think of a recursive approach. For each position i in the string (from 0 to n-1), we choose the smallest possible character that is available (from the remaining characters) such that:

- Choosing this character and some arrangement of the remaining characters can result in a permutation that is larger than t.

But since n can be up to 5000, a recursive approach is not feasible. So we need an efficient way.

Alternatively, we can model this as a greedy algorithm. Let's iterate through each position from left to right. At each step, we try to place the smallest possible character that allows the remaining characters to form a permutation that is greater than the corresponding suffix of t.

But how to check if the remaining characters can form a suffix that allows the current prefix to be greater than t's prefix.

Let's break it down:

For position i, we have:

- The current prefix built so far (s[0..i-1]).

- The remaining characters (count of each character left).

We need to choose a character c for position i such that:

If the current prefix (s[0..i-1] + c) is lex greater than t's first i+1 characters (t[0..i]), then even if the remaining characters are arranged in the lex smallest way (sorted ascending), the entire string will be larger than t. So in this case, we can choose the smallest possible c (greater than t[i], and then arrange the remaining characters in sorted order to get the minimal possible permutation).

Alternatively, if the current prefix (s[0..i-1] + c) is equal to t's first i+1 characters (i.e., the prefix up to i is same as t's prefix up to i), then the remaining characters must form a suffix that is lex greater than the suffix of t starting at i+1. So in this case, we need to select a c that is equal to t[i], and then proceed to the next position with the remaining characters, ensuring that the suffix can be formed to be greater than t's suffix.

So the algorithm would proceed as:

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

1. Keep track of the current prefix (built so far) and the remaining characters.

2. For the current position i, consider all possible characters in the remaining characters, in sorted order (to find the minimal possible overall permutation).

3. For each candidate character c in sorted order:

   a. If c > t[i], then we can take this c, append the smallest possible permutation of the remaining characters (sorted), and return the result. Because this would form the minimal possible permutation that is larger than t.

   b. If c == t[i], then we proceed to the next position with the remaining characters (after removing c), and check if the suffix can be formed to be larger than t[i+1..n-1]. If yes, then this c is acceptable, and proceed recursively. If no, then we can't choose c here, so try the next character.

   c. If c < t[i], then even if we choose this c, the entire prefix will be smaller than t's prefix, so any permutation of the remaining characters won't help. So skip this c.

So the key is to find the earliest position where we can choose a character larger than t[i], and then fill the rest with the minimal possible permutation (sorted), or, if all characters up to position i are equal to t's, then the suffix must be larger.

So this approach is O(n^2), which for n=5000 would be 25 million operations. That's manageable in Python, but we need to optimize.

Now, let's outline the steps for the code:

Case 1: len(s) < len(t) → Output -1.

Case 2: len(s) > len(t) → Output sorted(s) in ascending order.

Case 3: len(s) == len(t):

   a. Check if sorted(s) is larger than t. If not, output -1. Else, proceed.

   b. Try to build the answer character by character, as described.

So let's handle each case.

But wait, for case 3a: sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation. If sorted(s) is larger than t, then the answer is sorted(s) only if it's larger. But what if sorted(s) is exactly equal to t? Then we need a permutation that is larger. So even if sorted(s) is not larger than t, there might be permutations that are larger.

Wait, the initial check for case 3 is whether s can form any permutation that is larger than t. For example, if sorted(s) is smaller than or equal to t, then there's no possible permutation. Because sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation, so any other permutation would be larger. So if sorted(s) is <= t, then no permutation can be larger. So in this case, output -1.

Wait no, wait. Because sorted(s) is the lex smallest. So if the lex smallest permutation of s is <= t, then all other permutations are >= the lex smallest. So if the lex smallest is not larger than t, then there is no permutation that is strictly larger than t. So in case 3, the first check is: if sorted(s) (lex smallest) is <= t, then output -1. Otherwise, proceed to find the minimal permutation that is larger than t.

Wait no. Wait, for example, suppose s is 'aab' and t is 'aab'. Then the sorted s is 'aab', which is equal to t. So no permutation is strictly larger than t, so output -1. If s's sorted is 'aab' and t is 'aaa', then the sorted s is 'aab' which is larger than t. So output 'aab'.

Wait, but the sorted s is the lex smallest permutation, which is the minimal possible. So if that is larger than t, then that's the answer. But perhaps there's a permutation that is larger than t but smaller than sorted(s). No, because sorted(s) is the minimal possible. So if sorted(s) is larger than t, then that's the answer. Otherwise, there's no solution.

Wait, that's not correct. For example, if s is 'acb' and t is 'abc'. The sorted s is 'abc' which is equal to t, so no solution. But if s is 'bac', sorted is 'abc', which is equal to t. So no solution. But if s is 'cba', sorted is 'abc' which is equal to t. So again, no solution.

Wait, but if sorted(s) is greater than t, then sorted(s) is the answer, as it's the lex smallest permutation. So in case 3, the minimal permutation that's larger than t is the sorted(s) if it's larger. Otherwise, no solution.

But that's only true if the entire sorted(s) is larger than t. So perhaps the initial check is to see if the sorted(s) is greater than t. If yes, output it. Else, see if there's a permutation that's larger than t but not the sorted(s). But according to the problem statement, the answer must be the lex smallest possible permutation that is strictly larger than t. So the lex smallest permutation of s is sorted(s) in ascending order. So if that permutation is larger than t, then that's the answer. Otherwise, no.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, suppose s is 'aab', which sorted is 'aab'. Suppose t is 'aaa'. Then the sorted s is 'aab' which is larger than t. So output 'aab'. But what if t is 'aab'? Then the sorted s is equal to t, so output -1.

Another example: s is 'abc', t is 'abd'. The sorted s is 'abc', which is less than 'abd'. So no permutation of s can be larger than 'abd', so output -1.

But what if s is 'acb', t is 'abc'? The sorted s is 'abc', which is equal to t. So output -1.

So the correct approach for case 3 is:

If the lex smallest permutation of s (sorted) is greater than t → output that.

Else → check if there exists any permutation of s that is larger than t. If not, output -1. Else, find the minimal one.

Wait, but how can there be a permutation that is larger than t but not the lex smallest? For example, if s is 'aab', t is 'aab'. Then sorted(s) is equal to t. So no solution. But if s is 'aba', sorted is 'aab', which is equal to t. So again, no solution. But if s is 'cba', sorted is 'abc'. If t is 'ab', then len(s) is 3, len(t) is 2 → len(s) is longer, so output 'abc'.

But when lengths are equal, the logic is different.

So, in case 3 (len(s) == len(t)):

We need to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is strictly larger than t.

But the approach of checking if the sorted(s) is larger than t is not sufficient. Because even if sorted(s) is not larger, perhaps there's a permutation that's larger. For example, s is 'ab', t is 'aa'. sorted(s) is 'ab', which is larger than 'aa', so output 'ab'. But if s is 'aba', t is 'aab'. sorted(s) is 'aab', which is equal to t. So no solution.

Wait, no. If s is 'aba', which has counts a:2, b:1. The sorted s is 'aab', which equals t. So no permutation is larger than t. So output -1.

So the conclusion is: when len(s) == len(t), then the answer exists only if the multiset of characters in s can form a permutation that is lex greater than t. And to find the minimal such permutation.

So the algorithm is:

If len(s) != len(t), proceed as per earlier steps.

Else:

   Check if s's character counts can form a permutation greater than t.

   If not, output -1.

   Else, construct the minimal permutation that is greater than t.

So how to construct that minimal permutation.

The approach is similar to the next permutation algorithm, but adjusted for multiset and target t.

Let's think about building the permutation character by character.

We can proceed as follows:

We have a multiset of characters available (the counts from s).

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

   For the current position, try to choose the smallest possible character c in the available characters (sorted), such that:

      The current character c, combined with the remaining characters, can form a permutation that is greater than t.

   Once such a c is found, add it to the result, remove it from the available characters, and proceed to the next position.

So the key is, for each position, find the minimal possible character that allows the remaining positions to form a permutation that, when combined with the current prefix, is larger than t.

To determine this, for each candidate c (sorted order), we need to check two possibilities:

1. If c > t[i]: Then, choosing c and appending the remaining characters in sorted order (to make the minimal possible permutation) will form a string that is larger than t. So this is a valid choice. We can take the smallest such c, append the sorted remaining characters, and that's the minimal possible.

2. If c == t[i]: Then, we need to check if the remaining characters (after choosing c) can form a suffix that is >= the suffix of t starting at i+1. However, since the entire permutation must be strictly larger than t, the suffix must be >=, but if the entire prefix up to i is equal to t's prefix up to i, then the suffix must be strictly larger than t's suffix.

Wait, no. For example, if the prefix up to i is equal to t's prefix up to i, then the suffix (from i+1 onward) must be lex greater than t's suffix. Because the entire string must be lex greater than t.

So when c == t[i], we need to proceed to the next position and check if the remaining characters can form a suffix that, when combined with the current prefix (which is equal to t's prefix up to i), makes the entire string lex greater.

But how to check if the remaining characters can form such a suffix.

But when building the suffix, the minimal approach would be to choose the smallest possible permutation of the remaining characters that is larger than the corresponding suffix of t.

But this seems like a recursive problem, but for large n, recursion is not feasible. So, perhaps, we can proceed greedily.

So, for each position i:

   For the current available characters (sorted), try each possible c in order (ascending to find the smallest possible).

   For each c:

      if c < t[i]: skip, because even if we choose c, the current prefix would be smaller than t's, so the entire string would be smaller.

      elif c > t[i]:

         Then, append the remaining characters sorted (smallest possible suffix), and the entire string would be larger than t. So this is a valid option. We choose the smallest such c, append the sorted remaining characters, and return the result.

      else (c == t[i]):

         Check if the remaining characters (after removing c) can form a permutation that, when placed after the current prefix (which is equal to t's up to i), the suffix is larger than t's suffix from i+1.

         If yes, then proceed by choosing this c, and move to the next position with the remaining characters and the suffix of t (i+1 onward).

         If no, skip this c.

So the algorithm is:

At each step, try to choose the smallest possible c that allows the suffix to be formed.

Now, how to implement this.

Implementing this requires:

1. For each position i, track the available characters (counts).

2. For each possible c (sorted) in available characters:

   a. if c > t[i]: append the sorted remaining characters and return.

   b. if c == t[i]: check if the remaining characters can form a suffix that is larger than t[i+1:]. If yes, proceed with c, and move to i+1.

   c. else: skip.

So the key part is, in step 2.b, how to check if the remaining characters can form a suffix that, when added to the current prefix (equal to t's prefix up to i), the entire string is larger than t.

In this case, the prefix up to i is the same as t's up to i. So, the suffix (from i+1 onward) must be strictly larger than t's suffix.

So the suffix can be formed by the remaining characters, and the minimal such suffix is the sorted remaining characters in ascending order. Wait, no. Because if the suffix is formed by the remaining characters in sorted order (ascending), that's the lex smallest possible suffix. So if even that is larger than the t's suffix, then any permutation of the remaining characters would work. Otherwise, we need to see if there's a permutation that is larger.

Wait, no. The minimal possible suffix (sorted in ascending) is the lex smallest. If this is larger than the t's suffix, then the entire string (prefix + sorted suffix) is the minimal possible. If the sorted suffix is not larger, then there is no way to form a suffix that makes the entire string larger than t, even if the prefix is same up to i.

Wait, for example, suppose:

prefix up to i is same as t's, and the remaining characters can form a suffix that is larger than t's suffix.

Then, the minimal suffix is sorted in ascending order. So if the sorted suffix is larger than t's suffix, then the entire string is valid. But if the sorted suffix is not larger than t's suffix, then even if there's a permutation of the remaining characters that is larger than t's suffix, we cannot choose it. Because the minimal overall permutation is the one with the sorted suffix, which would be smaller than any other permutation. So in that case, even if the remaining characters can form a larger suffix, the minimal overall permutation (with the sorted suffix) would be smaller than t, thus invalid. So the only way to proceed is if the sorted suffix (the minimal possible) is larger than t's suffix.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let's think of an example.

Suppose the current prefix up to i is equal to t's prefix up to i. The remaining characters must form a suffix that is lex greater than t's suffix.

The minimal possible suffix (sorted ascending) is the lex smallest possible. So if even this minimal suffix is larger than t's suffix, then the entire string is valid. Otherwise, no.

So, for the case where c == t[i], we need to check if the sorted suffix of the remaining characters is larger than the t's suffix. If yes, then proceed. Otherwise, even if there's a way to arrange the remaining characters, it's impossible because the sorted suffix is the lex smallest possible and it's not larger.

Wait, no. For example, suppose t's suffix is 'abc', and the remaining characters can form 'abd', which is larger. The sorted suffix would be 'abd', which is larger. So in this case, it's okay.

But if t's suffix is 'abc', and the remaining characters are ['a', 'c', 'b'], the sorted suffix is 'abc' which is equal to t's suffix. So even if there's a permutation like 'acb' which is larger than 'abc', but the sorted suffix is equal. So when we choose the sorted suffix (lex smallest), it's equal, thus the entire string would be equal to t. So we can't proceed with c == t[i] in this case. So to check whether the remaining characters can form a suffix that is larger than t's suffix, we need to see if the sorted suffix (lex smallest) is larger than t's suffix. If not, then even if there's some permutation that is larger, the lex smallest permutation (sorted suffix) would be <= t's suffix, thus the entire string would not be larger than t. Hence, in this case, we cannot choose c == t[i].

Thus, the check for c == t[i] is: after taking c, the sorted suffix (lex smallest possible) of the remaining characters must be greater than t's suffix.

If this is true, then proceed. Else, skip this c.

So, the algorithm steps are:

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

   sorted_candidates = sorted(available_characters)

   for c in sorted_candidates:

      if c < t[i]: continue

      elif c > t[i]:

          append c and the sorted remaining characters (after removing c) → this is the minimal possible permutation. Return the result.

      else: # c == t[i]

          check if the remaining characters (after removing c) can form a suffix that is lex greater than t[i+1:]

          To check this:

              create the sorted suffix (sorted remaining chars in ascending order) and see if it's lex greater than t[i+1:]

              if yes:

                  append c to the result, proceed to next position with remaining characters (without c) and the suffix t[i+1:].

                  break the loop over candidates.

              else:

                  continue.

   if no candidate found:

       return -1

So, in code, for each step i:

- Keep track of the available characters (as a frequency count).

- For each possible c in sorted order of available characters:

   if c < t[i]: skip.

   elif c > t[i]:

      take this c, then append the remaining characters in sorted order. Return the result.

   else:

      if the current position is the last (i == n-1), then since c == t[i], the entire string is equal to t. So this is invalid.

      else:

          create a sorted suffix of remaining characters (after removing c), and compare it to the t[i+1:] part.

          if the sorted suffix is lex greater than t[i+1:], then proceed with this c.

          else: continue.

So, the code must implement this.

Now, the key is to efficiently manage the frequency counts of characters and generate the sorted suffix.

Implementing this in Python:

We can represent the available characters as a Counter (dictionary) with counts for each character.

At each step, for a given c, we need to:

1. Check if c is present in the counter (count > 0).

2. If so, create a new counter with c's count reduced by 1 (and possibly remove the key if count becomes 0).

3. Generate the sorted suffix by taking the characters in the new counter, sorted in ascending order, and forming a string.

4. Compare the sorted suffix with t's suffix.

But generating the sorted suffix each time can be O(n) per check, which for n=5000 and per each candidate c (up to 26 steps per i) could be O(26*5000^2) = 65 million operations. Which may be acceptable for Python, but perhaps we can optimize.

Alternatively, when the current i is at position k, the suffix of t is t[k+1:], and the sorted suffix is the sorted list of remaining characters after taking c.

If the sorted suffix is larger than t[k+1:], then proceed.

So the code steps for each candidate c when c == t[i]:

   new_counter = copy of current_counter, subtract 1 from c.

   if new_counter[c] == 0, delete it.

   sorted_suffix = generate the sorted string from new_counter.

   if sorted_suffix > t[i+1:]:

       proceed with this c.

   else:

       skip.

But generating the sorted_suffix each time can be time-consuming for large n.

An alternative approach is to generate the sorted suffix as a list, and compare it character by character with t's suffix.

But even this may be O(n) time per check. However, considering that n can be up to 5000 and for each i we have up to 26 possible c's, the total time would be O(5000 * 26 * 5000) = 65,000,000 operations, which should be manageable in Python, given the 1 second time limit (which can handle about 1e8 operations).

But perhaps we can optimize further. Let's think:

For the remaining characters after choosing c, their sorted suffix is the sorted list of characters (ascending). So, comparing this to the t's suffix can be done in O(n) time.

But when we have to compare two strings of length m (m = n - i - 1), we can do it character by character.

So, for example, in the code:

suffix_t = t[i+1:]

sorted_suffix = ''.join(sorted([char for char in remaining_chars]))

if sorted_suffix > suffix_t:

    proceed with c.

Else:

    skip.

But generating the list of remaining chars each time may be expensive. So, perhaps, we can pre-sort the list of characters, and generate the suffix efficiently.

Alternatively, since the available characters are tracked via a counter, to generate the sorted list of remaining characters, we can iterate through the sorted keys of the counter and append each character the number of times equal to its count.

For example, if the counter is {'a':2, 'b':1}, then the sorted list is ['a', 'a', 'b'].

So, for the sorted_suffix, we can build it by:

sorted_chars = sorted(remaining_counter.keys())

sorted_suffix = []

for char in sorted_chars:

    sorted_suffix.extend([char] * remaining_counter[char])

sorted_suffix_str = ''.join(sorted_suffix)

Then compare with suffix_t.

But building this string each time can be O(n), but for n=5000, it's manageable.

So, in code:

At each step, for the current c:

if c == t[i], then:

   new_counter = current_counter.copy()

   new_counter[c] -= 1

   if new_counter[c] == 0:

       del new_counter[c]

   # generate sorted suffix

   sorted_suffix = []

   for char in sorted(new_counter):

       sorted_suffix.append(char * new_counter[char])

   sorted_suffix_str = ''.join(sorted_suffix)

   if sorted_suffix_str > t[i+1:]:

       # proceed with this c.

       current_counter = new_counter

       result.append(c)

       break

   else:

       continue

But even this can be optimized. For example, using the fact that the sorted suffix is the minimal possible. So, if the minimal suffix is not larger than t's suffix, then no permutation can be larger.

So, the code must proceed in this way.

Now, let's outline the steps for the code.

First, handle the case where len(s) < len(t): output -1.

Else if len(s) > len(t): output sorted(s).

Else (len(s) == len(t)):

   sorted_s = sorted(s)

   if ''.join(sorted_s) > t:

       output ''.join(sorted_s)

   else:

       # check if there's any permutation larger than t.

       # if not, output -1.

       # else, find the minimal one.

       # proceed with building the string.

But wait, even if sorted_s is not larger than t, there may be a permutation larger than t. For example, s is 'aba', which sorted is 'aab'. If t is 'aaa', then sorted(s) is 'aab' which is larger than 'aaa', so output 'aab'. But if sorted(s) is equal to t, like s is 'aab', t is 'aab', then no solution. So the initial check of sorted(s) is sufficient.

Wait, no. Because sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation of s. So if sorted(s) is larger than t, then output it. Else, there is no permutation of s that is larger than t. Because any other permutation is larger than or equal to sorted(s), which is <= t. So the answer is -1.

Wait, this is the key insight.

Because the sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation of s. So if sorted(s) is not larger than t, then no permutation can be larger. Because all other permutations are lex >= sorted(s), which is <= t.

So, in case 3 (len(s) == len(t)), the steps are:

1. Check if sorted(s) is larger than t. If yes, output sorted(s).

2. Else, output -1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because what if s has characters that allow a permutation which is larger than t, but sorted(s) is equal to t? For example:

s = 'ab', t = 'ab'. sorted(s) is 'ab', which is equal to t. So output -1.

Another example:

s = 'abc', t = 'abd'. sorted(s) is 'abc' < 'abd' → no solution.

Another example:

s = 'acb', t = 'abc'. sorted(s) is 'abc' == t → output -1.

But what about s = 'cba', t = 'cba'. sorted(s) is 'abc' < t → output -1?

Wait, no. sorted(s) is 'abc', which is lex smaller than 'cba' (t). So sorted(s) is not larger than t, but there are permutations of s that are larger than t, like 'cab', 'cba', etc. But the problem requires the lex smallest permutation that is larger than t.

Wait, the original problem states: find the lex smallest permutation of s that is strictly larger than t.

If sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation, and it is not larger than t, then any other permutation is larger than sorted(s), but may still be larger than t.

But in the case where sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation, then if it's not larger than t, all other permutations (which are lex larger than sorted(s)) could be larger than t.

So the initial approach of checking if sorted(s) is larger than t is incorrect.

Wait, this is a critical error in my reasoning.

For example, suppose s = 'cba' (sorted is 'abc'), and t is 'abx'. Then, the sorted(s) is 'abc', which is less than 'abx' (since 'abc' < 'abx'). But there are permutations of s that are larger than t, such as 'cab' (which is 'cab' > 'abx'? Let's see: 'abx' is compared with 'cab'. The first character 'c' vs 'a' → 'c' is larger. So 'cab' is larger than 'abx'. So even though sorted(s) is 'abc' (which is < 'abx'), there exists permutations of s that are larger than t. So the initial approach of checking sorted(s) is wrong.

Ah, this changes everything.

So the correct approach is:

In case 3 (len(s) == len(t)), we need to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is strictly larger than t. This may not be the sorted(s) if sorted(s) is less than t, but there exists permutations larger than t.

But how can this happen? Because sorted(s) is the lex smallest permutation. So any permutation larger than sorted(s) is lex larger. So if sorted(s) is less than t, then can there exist a permutation of s that is larger than t?

Yes. For example, sorted(s) may be 'abc', which is less than 'abx', but 'abx' is longer than 'abc'? No, same length. So s is 'cba' (permutations include 'cab', 'cba', 'acb', etc.), and t is 'abx'. Wait, but t is 'abx' and s is 'cba' (characters c, b, a). So s can form permutations like 'cba', 'cab', 'bca', etc. But since s's characters are c, b, a, the permutations can't form 'abx' since x is not present. So in this case, no permutation of s is larger than t.

Wait, perhaps my example is bad.

Let me think of a correct example where sorted(s) is less than t, but there exists a permutation of s that is larger than t.

Let's say s is 'acb' → sorted(s) is 'abc'.

t is 'abz'.

So sorted(s) is 'abc' < 'abz' (since c < z). So the sorted(s) is less than t. But s can form permutations like 'acb' (which is 'acb' < 'abz'?), 'bac' (bac < abz?), 'cab' (cab < abz?), 'cba' (cba > abz, since c > a). So 'cba' is larger than 'abz', thus the answer would be 'cba', which is the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

So in this case, the sorted(s) is 'abc', which is less than t. But there exists a permutation (cba) that is larger than t. So the initial approach of checking sorted(s) is incorrect.

So the conclusion is: the initial approach is wrong. The correct approach must handle the case where even if sorted(s) is not larger than t, there might be a permutation of s that is larger. Thus, the algorithm must find the lex smallest permutation that is larger than t, regardless of sorted(s)'s relation to t.

So back to the original problem.

The key insight is that even if the lex smallest permutation (sorted(s)) is not larger than t, there might be a permutation that is larger. So the initial check is not sufficient.

Thus, for the case where len(s) == len(t), we must proceed with the algorithm of building the permutation character by character, as outlined earlier.

So the steps for the code are:

Handle the cases where len(s) < len(t) → -1.

Else if len(s) > len(t) → output sorted(s).

Else:

   Proceed to build the permutation as per the algorithm outlined earlier.

So now, the code must implement the algorithm for case 3.

Now, the code:

Implementing the algorithm for case 3 (len(s) == len(t)).

First, we need to track the available characters (a Counter), and build the result step by step.

In Python, we can use a Counter from collections.

We also need to check at each step whether the remaining characters can form a suffix that is larger than t's suffix.

So the code outline is:

from collections import Counter

s = input().strip()
t = input().strip()

if len(s) < len(t):
    print(-1)
elif len(s) > len(t):
    print(''.join(sorted(s)))
else:
    # len(s) == len(t)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    result = []
    t_list = list(t)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Iterate through sorted characters
        for c in sorted(s_counter):
            if c < t_list[i]:
                continue
            elif c > t_list[i]:
                # Take this c and append the remaining sorted chars
                remaining = []
                for char in sorted(s_counter):
                    if char == c:
                        remaining.append(char * (s_counter[char] - 1))
                    else:
                        remaining.append(char * s_counter[char])
                remaining_chars = ''.join(remaining)
                temp_result = ''.join(result) + c + remaining_chars
                if temp_result > t:
                    print(temp_result)
                    exit()
            else:
                # c == t_list[i]
                # Check if remaining chars can form a suffix larger than t[i+1:]
                new_counter = s_counter.copy()
                new_counter[c] -= 1
                if new_counter[c] == 0:
                    del new_counter[c]
                # Generate the minimal suffix
                sorted_suffix = []
                for char in sorted(new_counter):
                    sorted_suffix.append(char * new_counter[char])
                sorted_suffix_str = ''.join(sorted_suffix)
                # Compare with t[i+1:]
                suffix_t = t[i+1:]
                if sorted_suffix_str > suffix_t:
                    # Proceed with this c
                    result.append(c)
                    s_counter = new_counter
                    break
                else:
                    continue
        else:
            # No candidate found for this position i
            print(-1)
            exit()
    # After all positions are processed, check if the built string is larger than t
    final_str = ''.join(result)
    if final_str > t:
        print(final_str)
    else:
        print(-1)

But wait, in the code above, when we reach the last character (i = len(s) - 1), the remaining characters is 1 character. So sorted_suffix_str is empty (since after taking c, new_counter is empty). Then, suffix_t is t[i+1:] which is empty. So sorted_suffix_str is empty, which is equal to suffix_t. So the check sorted_suffix_str > suffix_t is false. Thus, in the case where the entire prefix is equal to t, the code would proceed to append c, but after all steps, the final_str would be equal to t. So the code outputs -1.

But in the code, after building the entire string (final_str), it checks if it's larger than t, and outputs it, else -1.

So this code should handle all cases.

Let's test the code against the examples.

First example:

Input:

aad

aac

s is aad (len 3), t is aac (len 3).

sorted(s) is 'aad', which is larger than 'aac'. So code outputs 'aad'.

Second example:

Input:

abad

bob

s's length is 4, t's length is 3. So code outputs sorted(s) which is 'aabd'? Or wait, s is 'abad', sorted is 'aabd' → len(s) is 4, which is longer than t's len of 3. So code outputs 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab'.

Wait, no. Wait, 'abad' is the input s. sorted(s) is 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab'. What's the correct answer?

Wait, the second sample:

s is 'abad' → characters are a, a, b, d.

sorted(s) is 'aabd'.

t is 'bob' (len 3). len(s) is 4, which is longer than 3. So the minimal permutation is sorted(s) → 'aabd'.

But sample output is 'daab'.

This is a contradiction. What's the correct answer?

Wait, the sample input is:

abad

bob

The output is daab.

Hmm, why?

Ah, because len(s) is 4, len(t) is 3. So any permutation of s is larger than t. So the minimal permutation is sorted(s) in ascending order, which is 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab'.

Wait, this indicates that the code's approach for case 2 is incorrect.

Wait, this is a problem.

So, in the sample input 2:

s is 'abad' (characters a, b, a, d → sorted is 'aabd').

t is 'bob' (length 3). So len(s) is 4 > len(t). So according to the code, the output should be sorted(s), 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab'.

This indicates a bug in the code's logic.

Wait, this is a major issue. What's wrong here?

Ah! Because when len(s) > len(t), the code outputs sorted(s) which is the lex smallest permutation of s. But according to the sample input 2, the code's approach would output 'aabd', but the sample output is 'daab'.

So this is a problem. Why is this happening?

Because the code's logic is flawed.

Wait, the sample input 2's output is 'daab', which is a permutation of 'abad' (a, a, b, d). 'daab' is lex larger than 'bob' (len 3), which is correct. But 'aabd' is also larger than 'bob'. So why is the sample output 'daab'?

Wait, this indicates that the code's logic for case 2 (len(s) > len(t)) is incorrect.

But why? Because when len(s) is larger than len(t), any permutation of s is larger than t, so the minimal permutation is the lex smallest of s. But the sample output in case 2 is not the lex smallest permutation. So what's wrong here?

Looking at the sample input 2's output explanation:

Input:

abad → s is 'abad' (characters a, a, b, d → sorted is 'aabd').

t is 'bob' (len 3).

But according to the sample output, the answer is 'daab', which is lex larger than 'bob' (since len is 4 > 3). But why isn't the sorted(s) the answer?

Because the code's logic for case 2 is wrong.

Wait, the sample input's output is 'daab', which is a permutation of s. But 'aabd' is lex smaller than 'daab' and is also a permutation. So why is the sample output 'daab'?

This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, when len(s) > len(t), the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s. Because any permutation of s (which has a larger length than t) is lex greater than t. So the minimal permutation is the lex smallest of s, which is sorted(s).

But sample input 2's output is 'daab', which is not the lex smallest permutation of s. This indicates that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the sample input explanation is wrong.

Wait, no. Let's recheck the sample input 2.

Sample input 2:

s = 'abad' → characters are a, a, b, d.

The sorted permutation is 'aabd' (sorted in ascending order). But the sample output is 'daab'.

But this is impossible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, no. Let's read the sample input 2's note:

Sample input 2:

abad

bob

Sample output: daab.

But 'daab' is a permutation of 'abad' (d, a, a, b). The lex smallest permutation of 'abad' is 'aabd'.

So why is the sample output 'daab'?

Ah! Because the problem statement says that when len(s) > len(t), the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s that is strictly larger than t. Wait, no. The problem statement says:

When len(s) > len(t), the name is lex strictly larger than t. So any permutation of s would satisfy this condition. So the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s, which is 'aabd'.

But the sample input 2's output is 'daab', which is lex larger than 'aabd'. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the sample.

But according to the problem statement's second sample input, the output is 'daab'.

This indicates that the code's logic is incorrect.

So what's wrong here?

Let me re-read the problem statement.

Problem statement:

When the parents want the name to be lex strictly larger than t, and lex smallest possible.

So if len(s) > len(t), then any permutation of s is larger than t. So the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s. So for sample input 2, why is the answer 'daab'?

But according to the sample input 2's output, the answer is 'daab', which is not the lex smallest permutation of s. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the sample input or the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, looking at the sample input 2:

Input:

abad

bob

The output is daab.

But according to the problem's logic, when len(s) is 4 and len(t) is 3, the answer should be the lex smallest permutation of s, which is 'aabd'. But 'daab' is a permutation of s but is lex larger than 'aabd'.

So why is the sample output 'daab'?

This indicates a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the sample input 2 has a typo, but according to the problem statement, the sample input 2's output is 'daab' because it's possible that the code is incorrect. But according to the problem's logic, the code's approach for case 2 is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the sample input 2's output is correct because the code's approach is wrong.

But how?

Let me re-examine the sample input 2:

s is 'abad' (characters a, a, b, d). sorted(s) is 'aabd'.

But the sample output is 'daab', which is a permutation of s. 'daab' is larger than 'bob' because its length is longer. But why isn't the lex smallest permutation 'aabd' the correct answer?

Because 'aabd' is larger than 'bob' (since its length is longer), so the minimal permutation is 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab'.

This suggests that the sample output is wrong. But according to the problem statement, the sample input 2's output is 'daab'.

This indicates that there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input 2 has len(s) equal to len(t), but no. Let's check:

Sample input 2:

s is 'abad' (length 4), t is 'bob' (length 3). So len(s) is 4, len(t) is 3. So according to the code's logic, the output should be the lex smallest permutation of s, which is 'aabd'. But the sample output is 'daab', which is a contradiction.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect, or the sample is wrong.

But this can't be. So where is the mistake?

Ah! No. Because in the problem statement's second sample, the output is 'daab', which is a permutation of s. But according to the code's logic for case 2 (len(s) > len(t)), the code outputs the sorted(s), which is 'aabd', which is lex smaller than 'daab'. But the sample expects 'daab' as the answer.

This is a contradiction. So what's the correct answer for sample input 2?

The correct answer should be 'aabd', but the sample says 'daab'.

So either the code's logic is wrong, or the sample is wrong.

But according to the problem statement, the sample input 2's output is correct. So why is 'daab' the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's second sample input has len(s) equal to len(t), but no. The sample input's s is 'abad' (length 4), and t is 'bob' (length 3). So according to the problem statement's first two cases, the answer should be the lex smallest permutation of s.

But why is the sample's answer 'daab'?

This suggests that the code's logic for case 2 is wrong.

But according to the problem statement's note, the second sample's explanation says:

In the second sample, the output is 'daab', which is a permutation of 'abad' and is the lex smallest possible one that is larger than 'bob' (since any permutation of s is larger than 'bob' due to length).

But 'daab' is larger than 'bob' because of the length, but why is it the answer instead of 'aabd'?

Because 'aabd' is lex smaller than 'daab' and is also a valid permutation. So 'aabd' is the correct answer according to the problem's logic. But the sample output says 'daab' which is not the lex smallest permutation. This is a contradiction.

Thus, the sample input 2 must have an error, or perhaps the problem statement is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement requires the permutation to be lex larger than t even when len(s) > len(t). For example, if the permutation's prefix of len(t) is equal to t, but the permutation has more characters. But according to the lex order definition, a longer string is considered larger than a shorter one if the shorter is a prefix of the longer. So in this case, any permutation of s with len(s) > len(t) is larger than t. So the lex smallest permutation is the sorted(s), which is the correct answer.

But sample input 2's output is 'daab', which is not the sorted(s). So this suggests that the sample is incorrect.

This is a critical issue. So, why is the sample input 2's output 'daab'?

Let me re-examine the problem statement's note for sample input 2:

In the second sample, the output is 'daab'. 'bob' has length 3, s has length 4. So any permutation of s is larger than 'bob'. The lex smallest permutation is sorted(s) 'aabd', but the sample output is 'daab'. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement.

But perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement requires that the permutation of s must be lex larger than t even when considering only the first min(len(s), len(t)) characters. No. According to the problem statement's definition, the lex order is determined as per the standard definition.

So, the sample input 2's output is wrong.

But according to the problem's own note, the sample input 2's output is 'daab', which is a permutation of 'abad' and is lex larger than 'bob'. But 'aabd' is also a valid permutation, which is lex smaller than 'daab', and thus the correct answer should be 'aabd', not 'daab'.

Thus, this suggests that the sample input 2's output is incorrect, or the problem statement is wrong.

But perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the permutation must be a string that is lex larger than t, but not necessarily that the entire permutation is considered. For example, perhaps the problem considers the lex order in a way that even when len(s) > len(t), the string is not automatically larger. But according to the problem statement's definition, this is not the case.

The problem statement says:

A string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m if one of the two statements is correct:

- n < m and p is a prefix of q.

- there exists some k where p's first k-1 characters are equal to q's, and p's k-th character is smaller.

Thus, if len(p) > len(q), p is considered larger than q only if the first len(q) characters of p are a prefix of q. Otherwise, it's compared based on the first differing character.

Wait, no. The first condition for p < q is:

- n < m and p is a prefix of q.

Otherwise, if there's a k where the first k-1 characters are equal and the k-th is smaller.

But if len(p) > len(q), then p is larger than q unless q is a prefix of p. For example, p is 'ab', q is 'a': p is larger. p is 'abc', q is 'abd': p is smaller.

Wait, no. For example, p is 'abc' (len 3), q is 'ab' (len 2). Since p is longer, but q is not a prefix of p (p starts with 'ab' but is longer), then according to the first condition, since len(q) < len(p), p is larger than q only if q is a prefix of p. But q is 'ab', p is 'abc' → q is a prefix of p, so according to the first condition, p is larger than q.

Wait, the first condition says p is less than q if n < m and p is a prefix of q. So if p is 'ab' (len 2), q is 'abc' (len 3): 'ab' is a prefix of 'abc', so 'ab' < 'abc'.

Conversely, if p is longer than q, then p is larger than q if q is a prefix of p. Otherwise, the comparison is done at the first differing character.

Wait, no. The problem statement defines p < q. So, the first condition is p is less than q if n < m and p is a prefix of q. So, if p has a length greater than q, then p can't be less than q via the first condition. But whether p is greater than q depends on other conditions.

For example, p has length 4, q has length 3. If q is a prefix of p (e.g., q is 'abc' and p is 'abcd'), then p is larger than q. If q is not a prefix of p (e.g., q is 'abc', p is 'abdx'), then the comparison is made at the first k characters where they differ. So, for k=3, p's third character is 'd' and q's third character is 'c' → p is larger than q.

Wait, no. When comparing p and q where p's length is 4 and q's length is 3:

- Since p's length is greater than q's, the first condition (p < q) is not satisfied.

- The second condition applies only if one of the strings is a prefix of the other. For example, if q is a prefix of p (e.g., q is 'abc', p is 'abcd'), then p is larger than q.

- If q is not a prefix of p, then the comparison is based on the first differing character.

But the problem statement's definition may not be clear. For example, if p is 'abx' (len 3) and q is 'aby' (len 3), then p is compared character by character. But if p is 'abx' (len 3) and q is 'ab' (len 2), then p is considered larger than q because p's length is longer and q is a prefix of p's first 2 characters.

So, in the case of sample input 2:

s is 'abad' (len 4), t is 'bob' (len 3). The code's logic is to output the lex smallest permutation of s, which is 'aabd'. The sample's output is 'daab', which is larger than 'aabd'. So according to the problem statement's own logic, the sample is wrong.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the sample input or the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement's own definition, when len(s) > len(t), the minimal permutation is sorted(s), which is the lex smallest permutation.

Thus, the sample input 2's output is incorrect.

But the sample input 2's output is 'daab', which suggests that the code's logic is wrong. So what's the reason for this?

Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic for case 2 is incorrect, and the correct approach is to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t even when len(s) > len(t).

But that's not the case. Because any permutation of s is larger than t when len(s) > len(t).

So the code's logic for case 2 is correct.

Thus, the sample input 2's output must be incorrect. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

But according to the problem's own note for sample input 2, the output is 'daab', which implies that the code's logic is wrong. So where is the mistake?

Ah! I see now. The code's logic for case 2 is correct, but the sample input 2's output is correct because the code's logic is wrong.

Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, when len(s) > len(t), any permutation of s is larger than t, so the answer is the lex smallest permutation of s.

But in the sample input 2, the lex smallest permutation is 'aabd', but the sample output is 'daab'. This can't be correct.

Thus, this indicates that the sample input 2's output is wrong. But according to the problem statement, it's correct.

This is a contradiction. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the permutation be larger than t when compared up to the same length. For example, if s's length is 4 and t's length is 3, then compare the first 3 characters of s's permutation with t. If the first 3 characters are larger, then it's acceptable. Otherwise, even if the permutation's length is longer, but the first 3 characters are equal or smaller, then the permutation is not considered larger.

But according to the problem statement's definition, this is not the case. The problem states that a string p is larger than q if either:

- p is longer than q and p's first len(q) characters are exactly q.

Or, the first differing character between p and q (up to the minimum of their lengths) is larger in p.

So, for example, if p is 'aabdx' (length 5) and q is 'aabc' (length 4), then p is larger than q because the first 4 characters of p are 'aabd', which is larger than q's 'aabc' (since 'd' > 'c' at the fourth character).

If p is 'aab' (length 3) and q is 'aa' (length 2), then p is larger than q because q is a prefix of p (the first two characters are 'aa').

If p is 'ab' (length 2) and q is 'a', then p is larger than q because q is a prefix of p.

But if p is 'ab' (length 2) and q is 'ac' (length 2), then p is compared character by character. The first character is equal, the second character 'b' < 'c', so p is smaller.

So, in the sample input 2, s is 'abad' (length 4), t is 'bob' (length 3). The minimal permutation of s is 'aabd', which has the first three characters 'aab', which is larger than 'bob'? No, 'aab' is less than 'bob' because the first character 'a' < 'b'. So, the entire permutation 'aabd' is longer than 'bob' (len 4 > 3), but the first three characters 'aab' are not a prefix of 'bob' (since 'aab' != 'bob'). So the comparison between 'aabd' and 'bob' would be based on the first character. 'a' < 'b', so 'aabd' is considered lex smaller than 'bob', even though it's longer.

Ah! This is the key mistake.

So, the code's logic for case 2 is wrong. Because when len(s) > len(t), the permutation of s is larger than t only if either:

- t is a prefix of the permutation (so the first len(t) characters are exactly t), or

- the first differing character between the permutation and t (up to the first len(t) characters) is larger.

So, when len(s) > len(t), the permutation of s may not be larger than t. For example, if s's permutation starts with characters that are lex smaller than t's first len(t) characters.

Thus, the code's initial approach for case 2 is wrong. Because it assumes that any permutation of s is larger than t when len(s) > len(t), but this is not the case.

So, the code's logic for case 2 is incorrect. This explains why the sample input 2's output is 'daab' instead of 'aabd'.

Thus, the code must handle case 2 (len(s) > len(t)) by finding the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t, considering the first len(t) characters.

This changes everything.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect for case 2, and must be revised.

Thus, the problem has three cases:

1. len(s) < len(t): output -1.

2. len(s) == len(t): find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

3. len(s) > len(t): find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t, considering the first len(t) characters. If no such permutation exists, output -1.

Wait, but if len(s) > len(t), the permutation's first len(t) characters must form a string that is larger than t. Or, if the permutation's first len(t) characters are a prefix of t, then the permutation is larger than t.

No. According to the lex order definition:

If len(p) > len(q):

p is larger than q if q is a prefix of p.

Otherwise, compare the first min(len(p), len(q)) characters. If they are equal, then p is larger if len(p) > len(q).

Wait, no. The lex order is defined as follows:

A string p is lex smaller than q if either:

- p is a prefix of q and shorter, or

- at the first differing position, p's character is smaller.

So, if p is longer than q, but q is not a prefix of p, then the comparison is done up to the first min(len(p), len(q)) characters. If those are equal, then p is larger (since it's longer). But if they are not equal, then the comparison is based on the first differing character.

So, for example:

p = 'aab' (len 3), q = 'aa' (len 2). Then, the first two characters are 'aa' in both, but p is longer. So p is larger than q.

p = 'aab' (len 3), q = 'aac' (len 3). p is smaller than q.

p = 'aab' (len 3), q = 'a' (len 1). p is longer and q is a prefix of p, so p is larger.

p = 'ab' (len 2), q = 'aa' (len 2). p is larger because at position 1, 'b' > 'a'.

p = 'ab' (len 2), q = 'a' (len 1). p is longer and q is a prefix of p, so p is larger.

p = 'abx' (len 3), q = 'ab' (len 2). p is larger.

p = 'abx' (len 3), q = 'abc' (len 3). p is smaller.

p = 'abx' (len 3), q = 'aby' (len 3). p is smaller.

p = 'abx' (len 3), q = 'ab' (len 2). p is larger.

p = 'abx' (len 3), q = 'abcde' (len 5). p is smaller.

Thus, for case 2 (len(s) > len(t)), the permutation of s must be lex larger than t. This can happen in two ways:

- The first len(t) characters of the permutation form a string that is larger than t.

- The first len(t) characters of the permutation are equal to t, and the permutation is longer than t.

Thus, for case 2, the code must find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t, considering the first len(t) characters.

Thus, case 2 is similar to case 3, but the permutation is of length len(s) > len(t), and we need to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

But how to handle this.

Thus, the code's initial approach for case 2 is wrong. So the code must be modified to handle all three cases.

Thus, the problem's solution must handle:

- len(s) < len(t) → output -1.

- else (len(s) >= len(t)):

   We need to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

Thus, the code must be modified to handle both cases (len(s) == len(t) and len(s) > len(t)) in a unified way.

Thus, the code must be written to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t, considering the full lex order.

Thus, the code must handle all cases where len(s) >= len(t) with the same algorithm, and output -1 if no such permutation exists.

Thus, the code must proceed as follows:

Check if len(s) < len(t) → output -1.

Else:

   We need to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

But since len(s) can be greater than or equal to len(t), the code must handle this.

Thus, the code must:

- Check if the lex smallest permutation of s (sorted in ascending order) is larger than t. If yes, output it.

- Else, proceed to build the permutation character by character, as per the earlier algorithm.

But this is not correct, because when len(s) > len(t), the sorted permutation may not be larger than t.

Thus, the code must handle both cases (len(s) == len(t) and len(s) > len(t)) with the same algorithm.

Thus, the code's initial approach must be modified to handle all cases where len(s) >= len(t).

Thus, the code must:

If len(s) < len(t):

   output -1.

Else:

   proceed to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

Thus, the code must handle both cases (len(s) == len(t) and len(s) > len(t)) using the same algorithm.

Thus, the code's previous approach for case 3 must be extended to handle all cases where len(s) >= len(t).

Thus, the code must be modified to:

Read s and t.

If len(s) < len(t):

   print(-1)

Else:

   proceed to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than t.

   if such a permutation exists, output it.

   else, output -1.

Thus, the code must use the same algorithm as case 3 for both cases where len(s) >= len(t).

Thus, the code must be adjusted to handle the case where len(s) > len(t) by padding t with dummy characters (e.g., lower than 'a') up to len(s), but this approach may not be straightforward.

Alternatively, when len(s) > len(t), we can pad t with a new character that is lower than 'a' (e.g., a zero character) to make its length equal to s. Then, proceed as in case 3, but during the comparison, the padded characters are considered as lower than any existing character.

But how to handle this.

Alternatively, during the algorithm, when len(s) > len(t), the code can compare the permutation with t as follows:

- If the permutation's first len(t) characters are larger than t, then the permutation is larger.

- Else, if the first len(t) characters are equal to t, then since the permutation is longer, it is larger.

- Else, permutation is not larger.

Thus, to handle the case where len(s) > len(t), the code must compare the permutation with t as if t is padded with a character that is lower than any other character. This way, any permutation of s that is longer than t is considered larger than t if the first len(t) characters are equal to t.

Thus, the algorithm can be modified to handle this by padding t with a special character when len(s) > len(t).

For example, when len(s) > len(t):

   new_t = t + '0' * (len(s) - len(t))

   but '0' is considered to be lower than 'a'.

Then, during the algorithm, we compare the permutation of s with new_t.

But in Python, the '0' character has an ASCII code lower than 'a', so any permutation of s will have characters >= 'a', so '0' is treated as lower.

But the code must treat the padded characters as lower than any other characters.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

if len(s) < len(t):

    print(-1)

else:

    new_t = t.ljust(len(s), chr(ord('a') - 1))  # pad with a character lower than 'a'

    proceed as in case 3, comparing the permutation with new_t.

Thus, the code can handle both cases (len(s) >= len(t)) by padding t to the same length as s with a character that is considered lower than any possible character in s.

This way, when comparing the permutation with new_t, the code can proceed as in case 3.

Thus, the code must be modified to:

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

if len(s) < len(t):

    print(-1)

else:

    new_t = t.ljust(len(s), chr(0))  # pad with null characters, which are lower than 'a'

    # proceed to find the lex smallest permutation of s that is larger than new_t.

Thus, the code can proceed with the same algorithm as case 3.

But in practice, the code must pad t with a character that is lower than any character in s. For example, the empty character or a character with ASCII code lower than 'a'.

In Python, the comparison between strings of different lengths is done as per the problem statement's definition. But to handle len(s) > len(t), we can pad t with a character that is lower than any character in s.

Thus, the code can be modified to:

pad_char = chr(ord('a') - 1)

new_t = t + pad_char * (len(s) - len(t))

Then, compare the permutation of s with new_t.

Thus, the code can proceed with the same algorithm as in case 3, but using new_t.

Thus, the code can handle all cases.

Thus, the code must be rewritten to:

from collections import Counter

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

if len(s) < len(t):

    print(-1)

else:

    # Pad t with a character lower than 'a' to match the length of s

    pad_char = chr(ord('a') - 1)

    new_t = t + pad_char * (len(s) - len(t))

    s_counter = Counter(s)

    result = []

    t_list = list(new_t)

    for i in range(len(s)):

        # Iterate through sorted characters

        for c in sorted(s_counter):

            if c < t_list[i]:

                continue

            elif c > t_list[i]:

                # Take this c and append the remaining sorted chars

                remaining = []

                for char in sorted(s_counter):

                    if char == c:

                        remaining.append(char * (s_counter[char] - 1))

                    else:

                        remaining.append(char * s_counter[char])

                remaining_chars = ''.join(remaining)

                temp_result = ''.join(result) + c + remaining_chars

                if temp_result > new_t:

                    print(temp_result)

                    exit()

            else:

                # c == t_list[i]

                # Check if remaining chars can form a suffix larger than new_t[i+1:]

                new_counter = s_counter.copy()

                new_counter[c] -= 1

                if new_counter[c] == 0:

                    del new_counter[c]

                # Generate the minimal suffix

                sorted_suffix = []

                for char in sorted(new_counter):

                    sorted_suffix.append(char * new_counter[char])

                sorted_suffix_str = ''.join(sorted_suffix)

                # Compare with new_t[i+1:]

                suffix_t = new_t[i+1:]

                if sorted_suffix_str > suffix_t:

                    # Proceed with this c

                    result.append(c)

                    s_counter = new_counter

                    break

                else:

                    continue

        else:

            # No candidate found for this position i

            print(-1)

            exit()

    # After all positions are processed, check if the built string is larger than new_t

    final_str = ''.join(result)

    if final_str > new_t:

        print(final_str)

    else:

        print(-1)

Now, let's test this code against sample input 2.

Sample input 2:

s is 'abad' (length 4), t is 'bob' (length 3). new_t is 'bob' + chr(97-1) → 'bob' + 'Z' (assuming pad_char is chr(96)). So new_t is 'bobZ'.

The code will proceed to build the permutation character by character.

i=0:

t_list[0] is 'b'.

sorted(s_counter) is ['a', 'a', 'b', 'd'].

Iterate through 'a', 'a', 'b', 'd' → but the first two are 'a's.

For c='a':

c < 'b', skip.

For c='b':

c == t_list[0] (b).

Check if remaining characters (after removing 'b') can form a suffix larger than 'obZ' (new_t[1:]).

new_counter is {'a': 2, 'd': 1}.

sorted_suffix is 'aad', which is 'aad' compared to 'obZ'.

The code compares 'aad' with 'obZ'.

In Python, 'aad' < 'obZ' because 'a' < 'o' in the first character.

Thus, this path is skipped.

Next candidate is 'd' (c='d').

c='d' > 'b' → take this c.

Append 'd' and the remaining characters sorted (a, a, b).

Thus, the permutation is 'd' followed by 'aab' → 'daab'.

Compare 'daab' with new_t 'bobZ'.

The first character 'd' > 'b', so 'daab' > 'bobZ' → output 'daab'.

Thus, the code gives the sample input 2's correct output.

Thus, the code's logic is correct.

Thus, the code must be modified to pad t to the length of s with a character lower than 'a' when len(s) > len(t), and then proceed as in case 3.

This explains why the sample input 2's output is 'daab' instead of 'aabd'. Because the code now correctly handles the comparison between the permutation of s and the padded t.

Thus, the code's logic for case 2 (len(s) > len(t)) is corrected by padding t to the same length as s with a character lower than 'a', thus ensuring that the permutation is compared correctly.

Thus, the code now handles all cases correctly.
