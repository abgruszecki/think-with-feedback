Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the next palindromic time after a given input time. The input is in HH:MM format, and we need to output the earliest time that's a palindrome and comes after the input time. If the input is already a palindrome, then we still need to find the next one.

Hmm. So first, I need to check each subsequent time, minute by minute, until I find a palindrome. But how to efficiently iterate through the possible times without checking every single minute, which could be up to 24*60=1440 steps. Well, even 1440 steps is manageable, right? Because 1e3 operations are acceptable for Python in 2 seconds. So maybe a brute force approach is acceptable here.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think: a time is a palindrome if the string HH:MM is a palindrome. So for example, 12:21 is a palindrome because reversing it gives 12:21. Wait, no. Wait, the actual string is "HH:MM". So the full string must read the same forwards and backwards. Let's take the example input 12:21. The string is "12:21". Let's check: first character is '1', next is '2', then ':', then '2', then '1'. Reversed, it's '12:21' again. So yes, it's a palindrome. So the next time after that would be 13:31, as in the example.

So the approach is: increment the time by one minute each step, check if the resulting time string is a palindrome, and return the first such occurrence.

The steps would be:

1. Parse the input time into hours and minutes.
2. Starting from that time, check each subsequent minute (including wrapping around midnight) to see if it's a palindrome.
3. The first such time is the answer.

But how to handle the time increment. Let's model the time as minutes since 00:00. For example, 00:00 is 0 minutes, 23:59 is 23*60 +59 = 1439 minutes. Then, each minute we can add 1, modulo 1440 (since 24*60=1440 minutes in a day). So for each possible time from current_time +1 to current_time +1439 (mod 1440), we can check if that time converted to HH:MM is a palindrome.

So for each candidate time in that order, convert to hours and minutes, format as a string with leading zeros (like 05:09 becomes "05:09"), and check if it's a palindrome.

If any of those is a palindrome, return the first one.

So the plan is:

- Parse the input into hours and minutes. Convert to total minutes.
- Iterate over the next 1440 possible times (since after 1440 steps, we loop back to the same time, but since we start from current_time +1, the loop will cover all possible times once).
- For each time in the iteration, check if the HH:MM string is a palindrome.
- The first such occurrence is the answer.

Now, the key steps are:

1. Parsing the input time correctly.
2. Incrementing the time by one minute each step.
3. Formatting the time as a string with leading zeros (like 1 hour 5 minutes becomes "01:05").
4. Checking if the formatted string is a palindrome.

Parsing the input: split on colon. For example, input "12:21" becomes H=12, M=21.

Convert to total minutes: total = H*60 + M.

Then, for each candidate in 1..1440 steps:

current_total = (original_total + step) % 1440

Then, convert current_total back into hours and minutes:

hours = current_total // 60

minutes = current_total % 60

Then, format as hh:mm with leading zeros. So for hours, if it's 0, it's "00"; if 5, "05", etc. Same for minutes.

So using Python's f-strings: f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}".

Then check if this string is a palindrome. For example, "12:21" is a palindrome because the reversed string is the same.

To check if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the string to its reverse. In Python, s == s[::-1].

Yes.

So, the algorithm is:

Read input time as a string.

Parse into H and M.

original_total = H*60 + M.

For step in 1 to 1440:

   current_total = (original_total + step) % 1440

   H = current_total // 60

   M = current_total % 60

   time_str = f"{H:02}:{M:02}"

   if time_str == time_str[::-1]:

       return time_str

This loop will run at most 1440 times, which is acceptable for Python even in 2 seconds.

But wait, 1440 steps is 1440 iterations. For each iteration, we generate the string and check the palindrome. Since each iteration is O(1) (the string is fixed length 5, so reversing is O(1)), the total time is acceptable.

Yes. So this brute force approach is feasible.

So now, the code:

Read input as s.

h, m = map(int, s.split(':'))

total = h * 60 + m

for i in range(1, 1441):

    current = (total + i) % 1440

    hours = current // 60

    mins = current % 60

    time_str = f"{hours:02}:{mins:02}"

    if time_str == time_str[::-1]:

        print(time_str)

        exit()

So this code will loop from i=1 to i=1440 (since after 1440 steps, we've checked all possible times except the original, which we start from current_time +1).

Wait, for example, if the input time is 23:59, adding 1 step (i=1) will be 0 minutes (since 23*60+59=1439, 1439+1=1440 mod 1440 is 0. So hours =0, mins 0: "00:00", which is a palindrome. So the code would output 00:00.

Another example: input is 12:21. The code starts adding 1 minute (12:22), then 12:23, etc. until 13:31. The next palindrome after 12:21 is 13:31.

So the code seems correct.

Now, edge cases:

- Input is a palindrome. For example, input 12:21. The code starts checking the next minute (12:22), and proceeds until the next palindrome. So the code handles this correctly.

- The next palindrome is the same day. Like input is 23:59, next is 00:00.

- When the input is 00:00. The next palindrome would be 00:00? No. Wait, if input is 00:00 (which is a palindrome), then the code would check the next times. But 00:00 is a palindrome. So according to the problem statement, if the input time is palindromic, output the soonest after. So the code will skip the current time and look for the next. So in this case, the next possible would be 01:10, but wait, 01:10 is not a palindrome. Wait, wait:

Wait, the time "01:10" as a string is "01:10". Reversed, it's '01:10' reversed is '01:10'[::-1] is '01:10' reversed as a string. Let's see: "01:10" -> reverse is '01:10'[::-1] gives '01:10' -> no. Wait, the original string is '01:10', reversed is '01:10'[::-1] which is '01:10' reversed as characters. Let's see:

Original: '0','1',':','1','0'

Reversed: '0','1',':','1','0' â†’ same. Wait, yes! So "01:10" is a palindrome. Wait, no. Wait:

Original string is "01:10". Let's reverse each character:

Original characters: 0,1,:,1,0 â†’ reversed is 0,1,:,1,0 â†’ same. So yes, "01:10" is a palindrome.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 01:10 â†’ as a time, when reversed, would it be 01:10 â†’ no. Wait, the entire string reversed is '01:10' â†’ same as original. So yes. So 01:10 is a palindrome.

So in that case, after 00:00, the next palindrome is 00:00 again? Wait, no. Because 00:00 is a palindrome, but the code checks the next time. So if input is 00:00, the code starts checking i=1 (current_total = 1 minute â†’ 00:01 â†’ "00:01" which reversed is '10:00' â†’ no). Then it checks all times until the next palindrome. The next palindrome after 00:00 would be 01:10 (as that's a palindrome). Wait, no. Let's see: 01:10 â†’ as a string "01:10". Reversed, it's "01:10" â†’ same as original. So yes, it's a palindrome. So the next palindrome after 00:00 would be 01:10.

Wait, but what about 00:00? The code will check from i=1 to 1440. So when the input is 00:00 (palindrome), the code looks for the next palindrome. Let's see:

input is 00:00. Then the code will check 00:01 (i=1), then 00:02, ..., 00:59 (i=59), then 01:00 (i=60), then 01:01 (i=61), which is "01:01" â†’ reversed "10:10", which is not the same. So 01:01 is not a palindrome. But 01:10 is "01:10", reversed is '01:10' â†’ no, wait. Wait, the string "01:10" reversed is '01:10' â†’ no. Wait, let's write the string as characters:

Original: '0', '1', ':', '1', '0' â†’ reversed would be '0', '1', ':', '1', '0' â†’ same. So yes, it's a palindrome.

So after 00:00, the next palindrome is 01:10. So the code would find that.

Wait, but what about 00:00 itself? The code would check i from 1 to 1440. So 00:00 is only considered if i=0 (original_total +0 = 0 â†’ same as input). But the code starts at i=1, so it's not considered. So the code is correct.

So the code will correctly find the next palindrome.

Another example: input is 23:59 â†’ next is 00:00.

Another case: input is 11:11 â†’ which is a palindrome. The code would check the next minute, 11:12. The next palindrome would be 12:21, etc.

So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Now, in Python, how to handle the formatting. For hours and minutes less than 10, leading zeros are required. Using f-strings with 02d format.

Yes.

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    h, m = map(int, s.split(':'))

    total = h * 60 + m

    for i in range(1, 1441):

        current = (total + i) % 1440

        hours = current // 60

        mins = current % 60

        time_str = f"{hours:02}:{mins:02}"

        if time_str == time_str[::-1]:

            print(time_str, file=output_stream)

            break



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
23:59
""",
            "output": \
"""\
00:00
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second example: 23:59 â†’ total is 23*60 +59= 1439.

i=1 â†’ total+1=1440 â†’ mod 1440 is 0 â†’ 0 hours, 0 mins â†’ 00:00 â†’ which is a palindrome. So the code outputs 00:00.

Another test case: input is 00:00 â†’ code checks i from 1. So the next time is 00:01, not a palindrome. Then 00:02, etc. The first palindrome after 00:00 would be 01:10, which is 70 minutes later (i=70). So when i=70, current is 70 â†’ 70//60=1, 70%60=10 â†’ "01:10" â†’ reversed is "01:10", which is a palindrome. So output is 01:10.

Yes.

So the code should work.

```python
s = input().strip()
h, m = map(int, s.split(':'))
total = h * 60 + m
for i in range(1, 1441):
    current = (total + i) % 1440
    hours = current // 60
    mins = current % 60
    time_str = f"{hours:02}:{mins:02}"
    if time_str == time_str[::-1]:
        print(time_str)
        break
```
