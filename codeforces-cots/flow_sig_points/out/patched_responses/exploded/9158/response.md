Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we have a tree with n nodes. Each node has some apples. Sagheer can swap the apples of any two distinct nodes. Then, he and Soliman play a game where they take turns taking apples. Soliman goes first. We need to find the number of swap pairs (u, v) such that after swapping, Sagheer can win the game if both play optimally.

Hmm. The key here is to model the game as a combinatorial game where each node contributes some Grundy number (nimber) and the overall XOR of these determines the winner. Because in normal play Nim-like games, the first player wins if the XOR is non-zero. But wait, in this problem's note, after swapping nodes 1 and 3, the leaves have 2 apples each. The example explanation says that Sagheer can mirror moves, leading to a win. So perhaps the parity of the game's Grundy numbers depends on the levels of the nodes or something related to their depths.

Wait, the problem states that all paths from root to leaves have the same parity. So, all leaves are at the same parity depth. Let's call the parity of the root to leaf paths as either even or odd. Since the tree's structure has this special property, the game's outcome might depend on the parity of the nodes' depths.

Let me think about how each node contributes to the game. For a leaf node (which is at a certain depth), the options are to take any non-empty subset of apples. That's equivalent to a nim heap of size a_i, since each move removes any number from 1 to a_i. So the Grundy number for a leaf node is a_i.

But for a non-leaf node, when you take a subset of apples, you move them to one of the children. So the apples are effectively moved into the child's pile. So, the move here is similar to splitting the pile, but the choice of which child to move to. How does that affect the Grundy number?

Wait, let's model the game. For a non-leaf node, the current player can take a subset S of apples (non-empty) and move them to a child. The key is that the player can choose which child to move them to. So the possible moves for a node u with apples a are:

For each child v of u:

   The player can take k apples (k >=1) from u and add them to v. So the move affects the state of v's apples (since moving k apples to v would increase v's apples by k, but the next players can then act on v). However, the game is such that the apples in a node are handled as per their rules. Wait, but the initial state after the swap is the starting point of the game. The players make moves by taking a subset from a node and either eating (if it's a leaf) or moving to a child. So during the game, the apples can be in transit, but the problem's rules specify that each move involves taking apples and either eating (if leaf) or moving to a child (if non-leaf). So the apples in a non-leaf node can't be eaten; they must be moved down the tree towards the leaves.

So the game is played by moving apples down the tree until they reach a leaf, where they can be eaten. Each move affects the current node's apples (taking some) and possibly a child's apples (if moving to a child). But how does this translate into Grundy numbers?

Let me think recursively. The Grundy number of a node depends on its children's Grundy numbers.

For a leaf node, the Grundy number is the number of apples. Because each move takes some subset (equivalent to choosing any number from 1 to a_i, so it's a nim heap of size a_i).

For a non-leaf node, the possible moves are to take a subset S (non-empty) of apples and move them to a child. But moving them to a child v: when you move k apples to v, that adds k apples to v's pile. Wait, but each time you move to a child, the next move could be on that child. However, when you move apples to a child, the child's apples are now increased by k, and that changes the possible moves for that child. So the game is a bit more complex. The game state is determined by the apples in each node. The game is a DAG because apples can only move towards the leaves.

But considering that each node's Grundy number is based on the possible options, perhaps for a non-leaf node u, the Grundy number is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all its children. Because when you move some apples to a child, the number of apples you can move (the subset taken) affects the possible moves. Wait, maybe the Grundy number for a non-leaf node is the XOR of its children's Grundy numbers multiplied by the number of apples in u? Or perhaps the Grundy number for u is (number of apples) * (XOR of children's Grundy numbers + 1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the key insight here might be that for a non-leaf node, the Grundy number is equal to the XOR of the Grundy numbers of its children. Because when you move apples to a child, the player can choose which child to move to, but the Grundy number of the node depends on the options available. Let's see:

Suppose node u has two children v and w. If the player moves k apples to v, then the Grundy number contributed by u's move would be the k * (Grundy of v), but since the player can choose any subset, maybe it's equivalent to the mex (minimum excludant) of all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the Grundy number for u is (a_u) multiplied by the XOR of the children's Grundy numbers. Or perhaps the XOR of the children's Grundy numbers multiplied by the parity of the depth?

Wait, let's think in terms of the game rules. For a non-leaf node u, each move consists of choosing a non-empty subset of apples (let's say k apples) and moving them to one of the children. When you move k apples to child v, this is equivalent to adding k apples to v's pile. However, the player can choose any child. So the possible moves for u are:

For any child v of u, the player can take any k >=1 apples from u, and add them to v. So each such move is equivalent to converting u's k apples into v's apples. The Grundy number for u would then be the mex over all possible moves. But since the player can choose any child and any k, perhaps the Grundy number for u is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of its children, multiplied by the number of apples in u. Or perhaps the Grundy number for u is the XOR of the children's Grundy numbers, and the number of apples determines how many times this can be done. Wait, no. Because each time you take k apples from u and move them to a child, you can only do it once (since after moving, u's apples are reduced by k, but the player's move is to take a subset once). Wait, no. Wait, each move is a single operation: take a subset of apples from u, and move them to a child. So the player can take 1 apple, 2 apples, etc., up to a_u apples. But each time, they move all the taken apples to one child. So each possible move for u is to choose a child v and a number k (1 <=k <=a_u). Then, the effect is that u's a_u decreases by k (since we took k apples from u), and v's a_v increases by k. But the next moves would then depend on the new a_u and a_v. However, this seems complicated to model, as the game state is dynamic. But since Sagheer can swap apples once before the game starts, the initial state is the swapped a_u and a_v. So the initial state's Grundy numbers determine the game outcome.

Wait, but the game's outcome depends on the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all nodes. But how does moving apples affect this? Because when you take k apples from u and move them to v, you are changing the state of u and v. So perhaps the initial state's Grundy numbers are sufficient to compute the outcome. But this seems unlikely, as the moves affect the nodes' apples. So perhaps the initial Grundy numbers are not sufficient, but there's a way to model the game's Grundy number as the XOR of each node's a_i multiplied by some value based on their depth's parity.

Alternatively, the key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all nodes, where the Grundy number of a node is a_i multiplied by a coefficient that depends on the parity of the node's depth relative to the leaves.

Wait, the tree's paths from root to leaves all have the same parity. Let's say the parity is even. Then, the depth of each leaf is even (if root is at depth 0). But the depth parity of non-leaf nodes varies. So for each node, depending on whether the number of steps from it to a leaf is even or odd (or perhaps the depth parity), the contribution of its apples to the overall Grundy number is either a_i or a_i XOR something.

Alternatively, the parity of the node's depth (relative to the root) can determine whether the node's apples contribute as a nim-heap or not. For example, nodes at even depths (like the root) contribute their apples to the XOR, while nodes at odd depths do not. Or the other way around. But how?

Let's look at the first example. The tree has nodes 1 (root), 2 and 3 (children of 1). The leaves are 2 and 3. So the root is depth 0, leaves are depth 1. The path length is 1, which is odd. So the problem's condition says all paths have the same parity. So in this case, the root to leaf path is of odd length (depth 1 for leaves). After swapping node 1 and node 3, node 1 has 3 apples, nodes 2 and 3 have 2 each. Let's see:

Original a was [2, 2, 3]. After swap, a is [3, 2, 2]. Now, how does the game work?

The game's initial state is the swapped a. Then Soliman and Sagheer play. The overall XOR of the Grundy numbers must be non-zero for Soliman to win (since he goes first), but wait no. Because in normal play, if the XOR is non-zero, the first player can win. But here, we need Sagheer to win. Wait, after the swap, the players start playing, and Sagheer is the second player. So the XOR of the Grundy numbers must be zero for Sagheer to win. Because if the XOR is zero, the first player (Soliman) cannot make a move that results in a non-zero XOR, so Sagheer would have a winning strategy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The game's outcome is determined by the initial position. The first player (Soliman) can win if the initial position's Grundy number is non-zero. So Sagheer wants the initial position's Grundy number to be zero. Because then Soliman has no winning moves, and Sagheer wins. So the problem reduces to finding the number of swaps (u, v) such that the XOR of all nodes' Grundy numbers after swapping is zero.

But how do we compute the Grundy numbers for each node?

Let's think recursively. For a leaf node, the Grundy number is a_i. Because each move takes a subset of apples and eats them, which is equivalent to a nim heap of a_i.

For a non-leaf node u, when you take k apples and move them to a child v, the effect is that the apples are now in v. But v's Grundy number depends on its own a_i. However, since the player can choose any child, the possible moves from u are to any of its children, with any k >=1. So the Grundy number for u is the mex of all possible options after making such moves.

But calculating mex for all possible moves would be time-consuming for large trees. There's a smarter way here. Maybe the Grundy number for a non-leaf node is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of its children. Let's see:

Suppose u has children v and w. Then, moving k apples to v would contribute k * G(v) to the overall game state. But how is this handled? Hmm, perhaps each non-leaf node u's Grundy number is equal to the XOR of its children's Grundy numbers. Because when you move apples to a child, you can choose which child, so the possible moves would be equivalent to XORing with the child's Grundy number multiplied by k. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the node's depth (relative to the root) plays a role. Let's consider that for a node u, the contribution to the overall XOR is (a_u) multiplied by some factor based on the parity of the depth. For example, nodes at even depths contribute a_u, and nodes at odd depths contribute 0. Or vice versa.

Wait, in the first example after swapping, the root (depth 0) has 3 apples. The leaves (depth 1) have 2 and 2. The total XOR would be 3 (root) XOR 2 XOR 2 = 3 XOR 0 = 3. But according to the example, Sagheer wins, which implies the XOR is zero. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. Let's re-examine the example. After swapping node 1 and 3:

- Root (node 1) has 3 apples. Since it's a non-leaf, moving apples to its children (nodes 2 and 3). The leaves are 2 and 3, which are now each with 2 apples.

The game's outcome is that the XOR is zero. How?

In this scenario, the root can't eat apples. The leaves can each take apples. But the root can move apples to either child. Let's think of each node's contribution.

But maybe the correct model is that the Grundy number for a node is a_i multiplied by 2^d, where d is the depth. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the Grundy number for a node depends on the parity of the number of steps from the node to the leaves. For example, nodes that are an even number of steps away from a leaf (including themselves) contribute a_i, and those with an odd number contribute 0. Or vice versa.

Wait, considering that the tree has all paths from root to leaves with the same parity. Let's denote that parity as P (which can be even or odd). For each node, the depth from root is such that when you subtract it from the path length to a leaf, you get a certain value. For example, the depth of a leaf is P (since the path from root to leaf has length P). So for a non-leaf node u, the depth is such that when you go down to a leaf, the remaining path has length (P - depth of u). Since all leaves are at the same parity, the (P - depth) mod 2 gives the parity of the path from u to a leaf.

Wait, the path from u to a leaf has length (depth of leaf - depth of u). All leaves have depth d, where d has parity P. So the path from u to a leaf has length (d - depth_u). Since d is fixed parity, the parity of (d - depth_u) is (P - depth_u mod 2) mod 2. But all leaves are at the same depth parity, so for all leaves, the parity of their depth is P. So, the parity of the path from u to a leaf is (P - depth_u) mod 2. But since all paths from root to leaves are parity P, then the parity of the path from u to a leaf is (P - depth_u) mod 2. Since all leaves are at the same parity, this is the same for all leaves. So for each node u, the parity of the path from u to a leaf is (P - depth_u) mod 2.

Let me call this value the 'parity' of the node. For example, if P is even, then nodes with even depth have (P - depth_u) even, which mod 2 is 0. So their path to a leaf has even length. Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose the root is depth 0. If all paths to leaves have even length (even parity), then the leaves are at even depths. For a node u at depth k, the path from u to a leaf has depth (leaf_depth - k). Since leaf_depth is even, this is even -k. So if k is even, the path length is even; if k is odd, it's even - odd = odd. So the parity of the path from u to a leaf is (even depth of leaf - k) mod 2. Which is (0 - k) mod 2 = (-k) mod 2 = (1 -k mod 2) if the original parity is even. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

But according to the problem statement, the tree has all root-to-leaf paths with the same parity. So, for each node u, the parity of the path from u to any leaf is the same. Let's call this the 'subtree parity' of u.

So for each node u, the subtree parity is (P - depth_u) mod 2, where P is the parity of the root-to-leaf path length. For example, if the root-to-leaf path has even length (P=0), then for a node at depth k, the subtree parity is (0 -k) mod 2 = (-k) mod 2 = (k mod 2) * (-1 mod 2) = (k mod 2) * 1. So if k is even, subtree parity is 0; if k is odd, it's 1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the subtree parity as (depth of u) mod 2 XOR P. Because:

The path from u to a leaf has length L, which is (depth of leaf) - (depth of u). Since all leaves have depth D with D mod 2 = P, then L mod 2 = (D - depth_u) mod 2 = (D mod 2 - depth_u mod 2) mod 2 = (P - depth_u mod 2) mod 2.

So, the subtree parity for u is (P - depth_u mod 2) mod 2. Which is equivalent to (P + depth_u mod 2) mod 2? No, because (P - (depth_u mod 2)) mod 2. For example, if P is 1 (odd), and depth_u is 2 (even), then (1-0) mod2 =1. So subtree parity is 1.

The key idea is that for each node, the subtree parity (the parity of the path from the node to a leaf) depends on the original P and the node's depth.

Now, according to some game theory concepts, the Grundy number for a node u is determined by its subtree parity. For example, if the subtree parity is even (the path from u to a leaf is even), then the Grundy number is the number of apples in u, otherwise it's zero. Or vice versa. Let's see.

In the first example, after swapping, the root (depth 0) has 3 apples. The subtree parity for the root is P (since the root's path to a leaf is length D, where D mod 2 is P. Since in the example, P is 1 (because the root to leaf path is length 1, which is odd), then the subtree parity for the root is (1 - 0) mod 2 = 1. So the subtree parity is 1, which is odd. If the Grundy number is a_i when subtree parity is even, then root's contribution is zero. The leaves (depth 1) have subtree parity (1 - 1) mod 2 = 0. So their contributions are a_i. After swapping, the leaves have 2 apples each, so their contributions are 2 each. The root's contribution is zero. The total XOR is 2 XOR 2 = 0. Which is the case where Sagheer wins, which matches the example. So this model makes sense.

So, the model is: each node contributes a_i to the XOR if its subtree parity is even (path from u to leaf has even length), and zero otherwise.

Wait, but how to determine subtree parity for each node?

The process is as follows:

1. Compute the original parity P of the root-to-leaf paths. Since all leaves have the same parity, this is fixed for the entire tree.

2. For each node u, compute its depth.

3. The subtree parity for u is (P - depth_u) mod 2. If this is 0, then the path from u to a leaf is even, so the contribution is a_i. Otherwise, the contribution is zero.

Wait, but in the first example, after swapping, the root has subtree parity 1 (since P is 1, depth is 0: 1 -0 mod2 =1). So the root's contribution is zero. The leaves (depth 1) have subtree parity (1-1) mod2 =0. So their contribution is 2 and 2. XOR is zero. So Sagheer wins. This aligns with the example.

In this model, the total XOR is the XOR of a_i for all nodes u where (P - depth_u) mod 2 is 0. Let's call this the 'effective' XOR. The problem reduces to counting the number of swaps (u, v) such that after swapping a_u and a_v, the effective XOR is zero.

So, the plan is:

- Precompute for each node u the parity (P - depth_u) mod 2. Let's call this 's_parity' for each node.

- The effective apples are the sum (XOR) of a_i where s_parity is 0. Let's call this total_xor.

- For the game to be a win for Sagheer after the swap, the effective_xor (after swap) must be zero.

- So, we need to count the number of pairs (u, v) where swapping a_u and a_v will result in the effective_xor being zero.

Now, how to model the effect of swapping u and v on the effective_xor.

Let's denote:

- For each node u, let's compute the current contribution to effective_xor. For example, if s_parity[u] is 0, then contribution is a[u], else 0.

The initial effective_xor is the XOR of all such contributions.

When we swap u and v, their contributions to effective_xor will change. Let's compute the new effective_xor as:

old_effective_xor ^ (current contribution of u) ^ (current contribution of v) ^ (new contribution of u) ^ (new contribution of v).

But the new contribution of u is a[v] if s_parity[u] is 0, else 0.

Similarly, new contribution of v is a[u] if s_parity[v] is 0, else 0.

So, the delta is:

delta = (new_u_contribution ^ new_v_contribution) ^ (old_u_contribution ^ old_v_contribution)

The new effective_xor is old_effective_xor ^ delta.

We want this new effective_xor to be zero.

So, the condition is:

old_effective_xor ^ delta = 0 → delta = old_effective_xor.

So, delta must equal old_effective_xor.

Let me rephrase:

delta = ( (s_parity[u] ? 0 : a[v]) XOR (s_parity[v] ? 0 : a[u]) ) XOR ( (s_parity[u] ? 0 : a[u]) XOR (s_parity[v] ? 0 : a[v]) )

We need this delta to be equal to the original effective_xor.

So, for each pair (u, v), compute delta and check if delta equals original effective_xor.

If yes, then swapping u and v would result in effective_xor being zero, and Sagheer wins.

Now, the problem is to count all such pairs (u, v), u < v (since pairs are considered unordered).

But with n up to 1e5, checking all pairs O(n^2) is impossible. So we need a smarter way.

Let's precompute for each node u:

If s_parity[u] is 0, then the contribution is a[u], else 0. Let's call this c[u].

So, the original effective_xor is xor of all c[u].

When we swap u and v:

new_c_u = a[v] if s_parity[u] is 0, else 0.

new_c_v = a[u] if s_parity[v] is 0, else 0.

delta = (new_c_u XOR new_c_v) XOR (c[u] XOR c[v])

We need delta == original_effective_xor.

So, the equation is:

(new_c_u XOR new_c_v) XOR (c[u] XOR c[v]) = original_effective_xor

Which can be rewritten as:

(new_c_u XOR new_c_v) = original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v])

Let me denote the right-hand side as target: target = original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v])

We need new_c_u XOR new_c_v = target.

But new_c_u and new_c_v depend on the s_parity of u and v, and the swapped a's.

Let's break down new_c_u and new_c_v:

new_c_u is a[v] if s_parity[u] is 0, else 0.

new_c_v is a[u] if s_parity[v] is 0, else 0.

So, new_c_u XOR new_c_v can be written as:

(s_parity[u] ? 0 : a[v]) XOR (s_parity[v] ? 0 : a[u])

So, for a pair (u, v), we need:

(s_parity[u] ? 0 : a[v]) XOR (s_parity[v] ? 0 : a[u]) = target.

But target is known for each pair (u, v) as original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v]).

Hmm. So the problem now reduces to counting the number of pairs (u, v) where the above equation holds.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

We can precompute for each node u, the s_parity, and a[v] (but a[v] is for node v). Wait, but for each pair (u, v), we need to check the equation based on their s_parity and a values.

Let's consider all possible cases for the s_parity of u and v.

Case 1: s_parity[u] is 0 and s_parity[v] is 0.

Then new_c_u = a[v], new_c_v = a[u].

The equation becomes:

a[v] XOR a[u] = target.

But target is original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v]) = original_effective_xor XOR (a[u] XOR a[v]).

So the equation is:

a[v] XOR a[u] = original_effective_xor XOR (a[u] XOR a[v]).

But (a XOR b) XOR (a XOR b) is 0. So:

a[v] XOR a[u] = original_effective_xor XOR (a[u] XOR a[v])

Let me compute the left side and the right side.

Let me denote x = a[u], y = a[v].

Left side: y XOR x.

Right side: original_effective_xor XOR (x XOR y).

So:

y XOR x = original_effective_xor XOR (x XOR y)

Let me rearrange:

y XOR x XOR (x XOR y) = original_effective_xor.

But (y XOR x XOR x XOR y) = 0, since XOR is associative and commutative, and a XOR a is 0. So 0 = original_effective_xor. So the equation holds only if original_effective_xor is zero. But the original effective_xor is the XOR of all c[u], which is the original state's effective_xor. So, in this case, for pairs u and v where both have s_parity 0, the equation holds only if original_effective_xor is zero, and the left side equals the right side. Which would mean that the equation is true only if original_effective_xor is zero. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible combination of s_parity for u and v.

Let me enumerate all possible combinations of s_parity for u and v, which are 4 possibilities:

1. u is 0, v is 0.

   new_c_u = a[v], new_c_v = a[u].

   equation: (a[v] XOR a[u]) = target.

   where target = original_effective_xor XOR (a[u] XOR a[v}).

   So the equation becomes (a[v] XOR a[u}) = (original_effective_xor) XOR (a[u] XOR a[v}).

   Rearranged: (a[v] XOR a[u}) XOR (a[u] XOR a[v}) ) = original_effective_xor.

   Which is 0 = original_effective_xor.

   So this case contributes only if original_effective_xor is zero, and the left side is 0, which requires that original_effective_xor is zero.

   But this is only possible if the original_effective_xor is zero. So, in this case, for pairs u and v both with s_parity 0, swapping them contributes to the solution only if original_effective_xor is zero. But this is a special case.

But this seems not useful. Let's proceed.

Case 2: u's s_parity is 0, v's is 1.

Then new_c_u = a[v], new_c_v = 0 (since s_parity[v] is 1). So new_c_u XOR new_c_v = a[v] XOR 0 = a[v].

The target is original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v} ). c[u] is a[u] (since s_parity 0), c[v] is 0 (s_parity 1). So target = original_effective_xor XOR (a[u} XOR 0) = original_effective_xor XOR a[u}.

So equation is a[v] = original_effective_xor XOR a[u}.

So the equation is a[v] = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[u}.

So for pairs where u has s_parity 0 and v has s_parity 1, the condition is a[v] = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[u}.

Case 3: u's s_parity is 1, v's is 0.

Similar to case 2, but swapped.

new_c_u = 0 (s_parity[u] is 1), new_c_v = a[u}.

new_c_u XOR new_c_v = 0 XOR a[u} = a[u}.

target is original_effective_xor XOR (c[u] XOR c[v} ).

c[u} is 0, c[v} is a[v}.

So target = original_effective_xor XOR (0 XOR a[v}) = original_effective_xor XOR a[v}.

Equation is a[u} = original_effective_xor XOR a[v}.

Which is same as a[u} XOR a[v} = original_effective_xor.

But since XOR is commutative, this is the same as case 2's equation.

Case 4: u's s_parity is 1, v's is 1.

new_c_u = 0, new_c_v = 0.

new_c_u XOR new_c_v = 0.

target is original_effective_xor XOR (c[u} XOR c[v} ) = original_effective_xor XOR (0 XOR 0) = original_effective_xor.

So equation is 0 = original_effective_xor.

So this case contributes only if original_effective_xor is zero.

So, the possible cases are:

For pairs u and v:

- If s_parity[u] is 0 and s_parity[v] is 0: equation holds iff original_effective_xor is zero.

- If s_parity[u] is 0 and v is 1: a[v} = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[u}.

- If s_parity[u] is 1 and v is 0: a[u} = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[v}.

- If both are 1: equation holds iff original_effective_xor is zero.

But how do we count the pairs efficiently?

We can precompute for all possible combinations:

1. For case where u and v have s_parity 0 and 0:

   The number of such pairs is C(count_0, 2) if original_effective_xor is zero.

2. For case where u and v have s_parity 1 and 1:

   Similarly, C(count_1, 2) if original_effective_xor is zero.

3. For cases where u has s_parity 0 and v has s_parity 1 (and vice versa):

   We need to count the number of pairs (x, y) where x is a node with s_parity 0, y is a node with s_parity 1, and a[y} = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[x}.

   And vice versa (y with s_parity 0 and x with s_parity 1), which would be the same as a[x} = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[y}.

But since the pairs are unordered, we can handle these two cases together.

Alternatively, we can split into two groups: group A (s_parity 0) and group B (s_parity 1). Then the pairs where one is in A and the other in B. For each x in A, we can count the number of y in B such that a[y} = (original_effective_xor) XOR a[x}.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the original_effective_xor as the XOR of all c[u}.

2. Split the nodes into group0 (s_parity 0) and group1 (s_parity 1).

3. Compute count_case1: if original_effective_xor is zero, then the number of pairs in group0 is C(g0, 2) + C(g1, 2), where g0 = len(group0), g1 = len(group1).

4. For cross-group pairs (group0 and group1), for each x in group0, find how many y in group1 have a[y} = (original_effective_xor) XOR x's a value.

   Sum over all x in group0 the number of such y.

5. The total valid pairs is count_case1 + cross_count.

But how to compute cross_count efficiently.

For cross_count, we can:

- Precompute a frequency map for group1's a values.

Then for each x in group0, compute the target as original_effective_xor XOR x.a, and add the frequency of target in group1.

But since group0 and group1 are separate, and pairs are unordered, but in this case, each pair (x from group0, y from group1) is considered once. Because in the cross-group case, each pair is considered once (since group0 and group1 are distinct groups).

But the cross_count is the sum over x in group0 of freq_in_group1[ (original_effective_xor) XOR x.a ].

This can be done efficiently by:

- Building a frequency dictionary (hash map) for the a values in group1.

- For each x in group0, query the frequency of (original_effective_xor XOR x.a) in group1's frequency map.

Summing all these gives the cross_count.

So the steps are:

Compute original_effective_xor.

group0: list of nodes with s_parity 0.

group1: list of nodes with s_parity 1.

Compute count_case1 = 0 if original_effective_xor !=0. Else, count_case1 = (g0 choose 2) + (g1 choose 2).

Compute cross_count:

build a frequency map for group1's a values: freq1 = Counter( [y.a for y in group1] )

cross_count = 0

for x in group0:

   target = original_effective_xor ^ x.a

   cross_count += freq1.get(target, 0)

Then, the total is count_case1 + cross_count.

But wait, in the cross_count, we are considering all pairs (x in group0, y in group1) where y.a = target. However, each pair (x, y) is considered once, and since the pairs are unordered, but x is in group0 and y in group1, there's no overlap. So the cross_count is correct.

So the total valid pairs is count_case1 plus cross_count.

But wait, let's think again.

In the cross_count, we are counting all pairs where x is in group0 and y in group1, and a[y} = original_effective_xor XOR a[x}.

These are the valid pairs for cases where u is group0 and v is group1. But what about the other case, where u is group1 and v is group0? Because in the equation for case 3, it's a[u} = original_effective_xor XOR a[v}.

But in this case, u is in group1 (s_parity 1) and v is in group0 (s_parity 0).

So for such pairs, the equation is a[u} = original_effective_xor XOR a[v}, which can be rewritten as a[v} = original_effective_xor XOR a[u}.

So, if we consider pairs where v is in group0 and u is in group1, then the condition is a[v} = original_effective_xor XOR a[u}. Which is the same as the condition for x in group0 and y in group1. So when we build the frequency map for group1 and iterate over group0, we are effectively counting all such pairs. Because for any pair (u in group1, v in group0) that satisfies a[v} = original_effective_xor XOR a[u}, it's equivalent to a[u} = original_effective_xor XOR a[v}, and thus this would have been counted when we consider v in group0 and u in group1.

But since the pairs are unordered, (u, v) and (v, u) are considered the same pair. However, in our cross_count, when x is in group0 and y is in group1, and x and y form a valid pair, we count it once. So we don't need to account for the reverse, because group0 and group1 are distinct, and each pair (x in group0, y in group1) is considered once.

Wait, but group0 and group1 are separate. So when we process group0 and group1's frequency map, we are counting all pairs where x is in group0 and y is in group1. But what about pairs where x is in group1 and y is in group0, but the condition is also met? Are those already counted?

No. Because for x in group1 and y in group0, the condition is a[y} = original_effective_xor XOR a[x}, which is the same as a[x} = original_effective_xor XOR a[y}. But since the equation is symmetric, these pairs are already covered when we process group0 and group1 in the cross_count.

Wait, no. Because x is in group0 and y in group1. For example, suppose x is in group0 with a[x} = a, and y is in group1 with a[y} = b. Then if b = original_effective_xor ^ a, then (x, y) is counted in cross_count. The pair (y, x) would require a = original_effective_xor ^ b. Which is the same as b = original_effective_xor ^ a. So the same condition. Thus, each such pair is only counted once, in the cross_count step. Because when x is in group0 and y is in group1, and a[y} = original_effective_xor ^ a[x}, then (x, y) is counted once. (y, x) is not considered because y is in group1 and x is in group0, but when processing x in group0, we look for y in group1.

So cross_count captures all pairs between group0 and group1 that satisfy the condition. So the cross_count is correct.

Therefore, the approach is correct.

Now, the steps for the code:

1. Compute the depth for each node and determine P (the parity of the root-to-leaf path).

2. For each node, compute s_parity = (P - depth) mod 2. If this is 0, the node contributes a_i to the effective_xor.

3. Compute the effective_xor as the XOR of all c[u}.

4. Split the nodes into group0 and group1 based on s_parity.

5. Compute count_case1 as (g0 choose 2) + (g1 choose 2) if effective_xor is zero. Otherwise, count_case1 is zero.

6. Compute cross_count by building a frequency map of group1's a values and checking for each a in group0 how many in group1 have a value equal to effective_xor XOR a.

7. The total pairs is count_case1 + cross_count.

But wait, the problem requires that u and v are different, but the code automatically handles that since pairs are considered as unordered and u and v are distinct.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, compute the tree's depth and determine P.

But how to compute the parity P of the root-to-leaf path.

First, find all leaves (nodes with no children). Then compute the depth of each leaf. Since the problem states that all leaves have the same parity in their depth, we can take any leaf's depth and compute P = (depth % 2).

So steps:

- Build the tree structure (parent array to adjacency list).

- Find all leaves (nodes with no children except their parent).

- Compute the depth of each node.

- For each leaf, get its depth mod 2. All leaves must have the same parity. So we can pick one leaf and compute P as (depth_leaf % 2).

Once P is known, compute s_parity for each node.

Then proceed as outlined.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

Read a as list (indexes 0 to n-1).

Read p as list (parent for nodes 2 to n, 1-based). So in code, nodes are 1-based.

We need to build adjacency list. Let's represent the tree as a dictionary where each node's children are stored.

For example, children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)] (since nodes are 1-based). For i from 2 to n, p[i] is the parent of node i. So children[p[i-2]].append(i).

Wait, in code:

The third line of input is p2, p3, ..., pn, which are the parents of nodes 2,3,...n. So for node i (2<=i<=n), parent is p_i (given in the input's third line as the (i-2)th element in the list).

So in code:

parents = list(map(int, input().split()))  # for nodes 2..n, parents are parents[0], parents[1], ..., parents[n-2]

children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # 0 unused, 1..n

for i in range(2, n+1):

    parent = parents[i-2]  # since for node i, parents[i-2] is p_i.

    children[parent].append(i)

Then, find all leaves: nodes with no children. So leaves = [node for node in 1..n if children[node] is empty]

Once we have the leaves, pick any leaf and compute its depth mod 2 to get P.

But how to compute depths?

We can compute the depth for each node using BFS or DFS.

We can start from the root (node 1), which has depth 0. Then for each child, depth is parent's depth +1.

So, compute depths using BFS:

depth = [0]*(n+1)

visited = [False]*(n+1)

from collections import deque

queue = deque()

queue.append(1)

visited[1] = True

while queue:

    u = queue.popleft()

    for v in children[u]:

        if not visited[v]:

            depth[v] = depth[u] + 1

            visited[v] = True

            queue.append(v)

Once depths are computed, find any leaf's depth and compute P.

Then, for each node u, compute s_parity[u] = (P - depth[u]) % 2.

Then, compute effective_xor as the XOR of a[u-1] (since a is 0-based) if s_parity[u] is 0, else 0.

Once we have effective_xor, split nodes into group0 and group1.

group0: list of a values for nodes with s_parity 0.

group1: list of a values for nodes with s_parity 1.

Then, count_case1 is 0 if effective_xor !=0. Else, it's combinations(g0, 2) + combinations(g1, 2).

cross_count is sum for each x in group0, the number of y in group1 where y == effective_xor ^ x.

So, code steps:

import sys

from collections import defaultdict

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())

a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

parents = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

for i in range(2, n+1):

    p = parents[i-2]

    children[p].append(i)

# Compute depth of each node

depth = [0]*(n+1)

visited = [False]*(n+1)

from collections import deque

queue = deque([1])

visited[1] = True

while queue:

    u = queue.popleft()

    for v in children[u]:

        if not visited[v]:

            depth[v] = depth[u] + 1

            visited[v] = True

            queue.append(v)

# Find leaves (nodes with no children)

leaves = [u for u in range(1, n+1) if len(children[u]) == 0]

# Compute P (parity of root-to-leaf path)

P = depth[leaves[0]] % 2

# Compute s_parity for each node

s_parity = [ (P - depth[u]) % 2 for u in range(n+1) ]

effective_xor = 0

group0 = []

group1 = []

for u in range(1, n+1):

    if s_parity[u] == 0:

        effective_xor ^= a[u-1]

        group0.append(a[u-1])

    else:

        group1.append(a[u-1])

g0 = len(group0)

g1 = len(group1)

count_case1 = 0

if effective_xor == 0:

    # compute combinations(g0,2) and combinations(g1,2)

    count_case1 = (g0 * (g0 -1)) //2 + (g1 * (g1 -1)) //2

# Compute cross_count

from collections import defaultdict

freq1 = defaultdict(int)

for num in group1:

    freq1[num] +=1

cross_count = 0

for x in group0:

    target = effective_xor ^ x

    cross_count += freq1.get(target, 0)

total = count_case1 + cross_count

print(total)

Wait, but in the code, the group0 and group1 are lists of a values. For example, group0 contains a[u-1] for all u with s_parity 0.

Yes.

Testing the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

3

2 2 3

1 1

The tree is:

1 is root, children are 2 and 3.

Leaves are 2 and 3.

depth of 2 and 3 is 1. P = 1 % 2 = 1.

s_parity for node 1: (1 -0) mod 2 = 1 → contributes 0.

nodes 2 and 3 have s_parity (1-1) mod2 =0 → contribute their a values.

So effective_xor is 2 XOR 3 → which is 1.

But in the original input, the effective_xor is 2 XOR 3 =1. Then, after swap, we need to have effective_xor zero.

But according to the first example, after swapping nodes 1 and 3 (a[0] and a[2], which are 2 and 3), the new a values are [3, 2, 2].

So group0 is nodes with s_parity 0. Those are nodes 2 and 3 (s_parity 0). Their a values are 2 and 3 → group0 is [2,3]. effective_xor is 2 XOR3 =1.

In the code:

group0 = [2,3], group1 = [2].

effective_xor is 2^3 = 1.

count_case1 is zero since effective_xor is 1 !=0.

cross_count: for each x in group0 (2 and 3):

x=2: target = 1 ^ 2 =3. freq1 is group1's a values, which is [2]. So 3 not in group1's freq1 → 0.

x=3: target=1^3=2. group1 has 2 → add 1.

cross_count=1.

So total is 0+1=1, which matches the sample.

Another sample:

Sample Input 2:

3

1 2 3

1 1

After processing:

Tree structure same as sample 1.

P is 1.

group0: nodes 2 and 3. Their a values are 2 and 3 → effective_xor is 2^3 =1.

count_case1=0.

cross_count:

for x in group0 (2 and3):

x=2: target=1^2=3 → check group1 (which has a[0] =1, but group1 is s_parity 1 nodes. Only node 1 has s_parity 1. a[u-1] for node 1 is 1. So group1 is [1]. So target for x=2 is 3: no in group1.

x=3: target=1^3=2. group1 has 1 → no. So cross_count=0.

Total is 0 → matches sample.

Sample Input3:

8

7 2 2 5 4 3 1 1

1 1 1 4 4 5 6

The tree's structure is:

Parent array for nodes 2-8 is [1, 1, 1,4,4,5,6].

So:

Node 2's parent is 1.

3's parent is 1.

4's parent is 1.

5's parent is4.

6's parent is4.

7's parent is5.

8's parent is6.

So the tree is:

1 is root.

Children of 1: 2,3,4.

Children of 4:5,6.

Children of5:7.

Children of6:8.

Leaves are 2,3,7,8.

Compute depth of leaves:

leaf 2 has depth 1.

leaf3 has depth 1.

leaf7: path is 1→4→5→7 → depth 3.

leaf8: path is 1→4→6→8 → depth 3.

So depth of leaves is 3. P =3 mod2=1.

For each node:

node 1: depth 0 → s_parity = (1-0) mod2=1 → contributes 0.

node 2: depth 1 → (1-1) mod2=0 → contributes a=2.

node3: depth 1 → same as node2 → contributes a=2.

node4: depth 1 → (1-1) mod2=0 → contributes a=5.

node5: depth 2 → (1-2) mod2= ( -1 mod2)=1 → contributes 0.

node6: depth 2 → same as node5 → contributes 0.

node7: depth3 → (1-3) mod2= ( -2 mod2)=0 → contributes a=1.

node8: depth3 → same → contributes a=1.

So effective_xor is 2 XOR2 XOR5 XOR1 XOR1 → 0 XOR5 → 5.

Then, group0 contains nodes with s_parity 0: nodes 2,3,4,7,8.

Their a values are 2,2,5,1,1. XOR of these is 2^2=0, 0^5=5, 5^1=4, 4^1=5.

Group1: nodes 1,5,6. Their a values are7,4,3.

So group0 has g0=5, group1 has g1=3.

effective_xor is 5 !=0 → count_case1=0.

cross_count: for each x in group0 (values 2,2,5,1,1), compute target=5^x.

For x=2: target=5^2=7 → check freq1 (group1's a values:7,4,3). How many 7's? There is one (node1's a is7). So adds 1.

x=2 again: adds 1.

x=5: 5^5=0 → look for 0 in group1's a (7,4,3). None. So 0.

x=1: 5^1=4 → group1 has 4 → count 1.

x=1 again: same as above → count 1.

So cross_count=1+1+0+1+1=4.

Total is 0+4=4, which matches the sample.

So the code works for the samples.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

Building the tree: O(n).

Computing depths: O(n).

Finding leaves: O(n).

Grouping the nodes: O(n).

Building frequency map for group1: O(g1).

Calculating cross_count: O(g0).

g0 and g1 are up to n, so overall O(n) time.

Space complexity: O(n).

So this should work for n=1e5.

Now, the code is correct.
