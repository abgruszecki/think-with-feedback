Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding all possible codes that match all the given attempts' correct counts. Each attempt gives a code and the number of correct positions, which is up to 5. The answer is the number of possible codes that fit all these constraints.

Hmm, the constraints are n up to 35 and m up to 10. The naive approach would be to generate all possible 2^35 possible codes and check each against all m constraints. But 2^35 is way too bigâ€”like 34 billion billion. That's impossible to process directly. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but maybe the number of possible codes that fit all constraints is manageable. For each of the m constraints, when checking a candidate code, the number of matching bits with each attempt's code must equal the given ci. So the candidate code must agree in exactly ci bits with each attempt's code.

So how can we compute the intersection of all these constraints?

Let me think. For each candidate code, check if for every (si, ci), the Hamming distance between the candidate and si is (n - ci). Because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. So the correct count is n - Hamming distance. Wait, no. Wait, the correct count is the number of bits that are the same. So for each attempt si and ci, the candidate code must have exactly ci bits matching with si.

Yes. So for each candidate code, for each attempt, the number of positions where candidate and si have the same bit must equal ci.

So the problem reduces to counting all possible codes that satisfy this condition for all m attempts.

The problem is to compute the number of such codes efficiently.

But with n up to 35, even iterating over all possibilities is impossible. So we need a way to compute this without brute-forcing.

An alternative approach is to represent the constraints as bitwise operations and find the possible codes that meet all of them.

Let me think of the problem as a system of equations. Each code must have exactly c1 matches with s1, c2 with s2, etc. So for each code x, the count of bits where x and s_i are equal is c_i for all i.

But how to compute the number of x's that satisfy all these counts.

Another angle: For each x, for each i, the Hamming distance between x and s_i is (n - c_i). So x must be in the set of codes that are at Hamming distance (n - c_i) from s_i for each i. And the intersection of all these sets is the answer.

But again, how to compute this intersection's size efficiently.

Hmm. Let's think of the first attempt. For s1 and c1, the number of codes x that have exactly c1 bits matching with s1 is C(n, c1). But when adding subsequent attempts, we need to find the codes that also satisfy the other constraints.

But with m up to 10, and each step possibly reducing the possible candidates, maybe the way is to iterate over all possible candidate codes that satisfy the first constraint, and for each, check the other constraints.

But even that might be too slow. For example, if the first constraint allows, say, 1e5 possibilities, and m=10, then 1e5 * 10 steps is manageable, but if the first constraint allows 1e9 possibilities, that's impossible.

So we need a better way. Let's think of the problem as a bitwise problem where each code is a bitstring of length n. For each code x, compute for each i the number of bits where x and s_i are the same, and check if it equals c_i.

But the problem is that 2^35 is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: Precompute for all possible candidate codes x, the number of matches with each s_i. But again, that's not feasible for n=35.

So perhaps we can represent each code x as a bitmask and find the counts for each s_i. But again, 35 bits is 3.4e10 possibilities. No way.

Hmm, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial approach. For example, for two constraints, the number of codes x that match exactly c1 bits with s1 and exactly c2 bits with s2. How can we compute this?

But even for two constraints, the calculation might be non-trivial. For m constraints, it's even more complicated.

Wait, maybe for each pair of attempts, we can find how the two constraints interact. For example, for each pair (s1, c1) and (s2, c2), the code x must have exactly c1 bits matching s1 and c2 bits matching s2. How can we model this?

The number of bits where x matches s1 is c1. Similarly for s2. Let's think of the overlap between s1 and s2. For example, let's consider how the two codes s1 and s2 differ. Suppose s1 and s2 have a Hamming distance of d between them. Then, when x matches s1 in c1 bits and s2 in c2 bits, the overlapping bits between s1 and s2 could influence this.

But perhaps there's a way to model the problem with bitwise operations and some combinatorial mathematics.

Alternatively, for each code x, the bits must satisfy that for all i, the count of x's bits that match s_i is exactly c_i.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each possible x (but that's not feasible for n=35), but perhaps find a way to represent the problem in terms of the given attempts.

Wait, let's think of x as a bitstring. For each attempt s_i, the bits of x can be considered in terms of how they differ from s_i.

But how can the constraints from multiple attempts be combined?

Alternatively, for each of the m attempts, the code x must lie in the set S_i, which is the set of all codes that have exactly c_i bits matching s_i. We need to find the size of the intersection of all S_i.

The problem is that S_i can be very large, and their intersection can't be computed directly.

But perhaps the number of possible codes that satisfy all m constraints is small enough to check. For example, in the third sample input, the answer is 1. So maybe we can generate all possible candidate codes that satisfy all constraints, but only up to a certain number.

Wait, but how? Let's think: For each possible code x, check if it satisfies all the constraints. But how to generate x's that are in the intersection of all S_i.

Another idea is to represent the problem for each bit position. But since each constraint is about the sum of matches across all bits, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

For each code x, the sum (over each bit position j) of (x_j == s_i_j) is c_i, for each i.

But x is a binary string. Let's represent x as a list of bits. Then for each i, the sum of (x_j == s_i_j) for j in 0..n-1 must equal c_i.

This is a system of equations where each equation is a sum over variables (x_j) that are 0 or 1. But the variables are the bits of x.

But how can we model this? For each i, the sum of the bits where x matches s_i is c_i. For example, if s_i is a binary string, then for each bit j, x_j equals s_i_j's value in some positions, and different in others.

But perhaps, for each code x, the sum for s_i is the number of bits in x that are equal to s_i's bits.

So the problem is to count the number of x's such that, for each i, this sum equals c_i.

So the variables are the bits of x. Each equation is a linear equation over the bits? Not exactly, because the sum is over (x_j == s_i_j), which is 1 when x_j equals s_i_j. But x_j can be 0 or 1. So, for a given s_i_j, (x_j == s_i_j) is 1 if x_j is s_i_j, else 0. So for each i, the sum over j of (x_j == s_i_j) is c_i.

But how to model this as equations. For example, (x_j == s_i_j) can be rewritten as (x_j XOR (1 - s_i_j))? Wait, no. Let's see: if s_i_j is 0, then (x_j == 0) is equivalent to x_j being 0. If s_i_j is 1, then (x_j == 1) is equivalent to x_j being 1. So (x_j == s_i_j) is equivalent to x_j = s_i_j. So the sum is the number of positions where x matches s_i, which is c_i.

This is a system of constraints. The variables are the bits of x, which are 0 or 1. Each constraint is a sum over a subset of the variables (those where s_i_j is 0 or 1, but how?), but perhaps this isn't straightforward.

Alternative approach: For each of the m constraints, we can precompute the required sum of matches. Let's model this as a problem where we need to find x (a binary vector of length n) such that for each i, the inner product of x with some vector equals some value.

Wait, let's think. For a given s_i, the sum of (x_j == s_i_j) for all j. Let's think of s_i as a binary vector. Then, x_j == s_i_j is equivalent to (x_j XOR (1 - s_i_j)) = 1. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

If s_i_j is 0, then x_j must be 0 for a match. So (x_j == s_i_j) is 1 when x_j is 0, 0 otherwise. So that's (1 - x_j) when s_i_j is 0.

If s_i_j is 1, then x_j must be 1 for a match. So that's x_j when s_i_j is 1.

So the sum for s_i is the sum over j of (x_j * s_i_j + (1 - x_j)*(1 - s_i_j)). Because when s_i_j is 0, the term is (1 - x_j), and when s_i_j is 1, it's x_j. So:

sum_{j} [ x_j * s_i_j + (1 - x_j)(1 - s_i_j) ] = c_i.

Simplify this term:

x_j * s_i_j + (1 - x_j)(1 - s_i_j) 
= x_j s_i_j + (1 - x_j - s_i_j + x_j s_i_j)
= s_i_j x_j + 1 - x_j - s_i_j + x_j s_i_j 
= 1 - x_j - s_i_j + 2 x_j s_i_j 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to write this. Let's see:

The sum is equal to the number of positions where x and s_i agree. So for each bit j, if s_i_j is 0, then (x_j == 0) contributes 1. If s_i_j is 1, then (x_j == 1) contributes 1.

So the sum is equal to the number of 0's in x where s_i is 0 plus the number of 1's in x where s_i is 1.

Alternatively, let's represent s_i as a bitmask. Let a be the number of positions where s_i is 1. Then, the sum for x and s_i would be (number of 1's in x that are in s_i's 1 positions) plus (number of 0's in x in s_i's 0 positions).

But this doesn't directly lead to a way to model the problem.

Another approach: For each x, the sum for s_i can be written as (number of positions where x and s_i agree) = c_i.

This can be rewritten as (number of 1's in x that are 1 in s_i) + (number of 0's in x that are 0 in s_i) = c_i.

Which can be written as:

sum_{j where s_i_j=1} x_j + sum_{j where s_i_j=0} (1 - x_j) = c_i.

Rearranging:

sum_{j} [ x_j * (s_i_j) + (1 - x_j) * (1 - s_i_j) ] = c_i.

Which simplifies to:

sum_{j} x_j * s_i_j + sum_{j} (1 - x_j)(1 - s_i_j) = c_i.

But this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider that for a code x, the sum for s_i is (number of positions where x_j = s_i_j) = c_i. Let's subtract this equation from the equation for s_0. But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the differences between the first attempt and the others.

Let's consider the first attempt s_0. For code x, the number of matches with s_0 is c_0. For each subsequent attempt s_i, the number of matches with s_i is c_i.

The difference between the two can be expressed as the sum over j of (x_j == s_i_j) - (x_j == s_0_j) = c_i - c_0.

But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, the difference between s_i and s_0 can be considered. For code x, how does the number of matches with s_i compare to the number of matches with s_0?

Let's denote the bits where s_0 and s_i are the same as A, and the bits where they differ as B. Then, for code x:

In the A positions, if x matches s_0 (and hence s_i, since they're the same), then that contributes to both counts. In the B positions, x can match either s_0 or s_i, but not both.

So, let's split the analysis into these two parts.

Suppose the number of A positions is same. Let's denote the number of positions where s_0 and s_i are the same as same, and the number where they differ as diff.

Then, for code x:

matches_with_s0 = a + b, where a is the number of A positions where x matches s_0, and b is the number of B positions where x matches s_0.

matches_with_si = a + (diff - b) (since in B positions, x matches s_i if it doesn't match s_0).

So, matches_with_si = a + (diff - b) = a + diff - b.

But matches_with_s0 = a + b.

So, the difference between matches_with_si and matches_with_s0 is (a + diff - b) - (a + b) = diff - 2b.

Which must equal c_i - c_0.

So, diff - 2b = c_i - c_0.

Rearranged: 2b = diff - (c_i - c_0).

So, b must be (diff - (c_i - c_0)) / 2.

Which implies that (diff - (c_i - c_0)) must be even and non-negative, and b must be an integer between 0 and diff.

This could be a way to model the constraints between two attempts.

But how does this help with m constraints?

This approach may get complicated when there are multiple attempts. For example, considering the constraints between all pairs of attempts.

But perhaps the key insight is that for each code x, the number of bits where x matches s_i must be exactly c_i for each i. So the code x must lie in the intersection of all the sets S_i, where S_i is the set of codes that have exactly c_i matches with s_i.

The challenge is to compute the size of this intersection efficiently.

An alternative idea is to generate all possible candidates that satisfy the first few constraints and then check the remaining constraints. For example, if the first two constraints reduce the possible candidates to a manageable number, then for each of those candidates, we can check the remaining constraints.

But how to generate the candidates that satisfy the first few constraints?

Let's think about the first constraint. The number of possible codes x that have exactly c_0 matches with s_0 is C(n, c_0). For n=35 and c_0 up to 5, this could be manageable. For example, C(35,5) is 324,632. If m=10, then for each of these 3e5 candidates, checking the other 9 constraints (each being a check against the code) would take 3e5 * 10 = 3e6 operations. That's feasible.

Wait, that's a possible approach. Let's break it down:

1. Generate all possible codes x that match the first attempt (s_0) in exactly c_0 positions. This can be done by generating all possible subsets of size c_0 of the positions where x and s_0 are the same.

Wait, no. Wait, the code x must have exactly c_0 bits matching with s_0. So for each of these, x can have any combination of bits that has exactly c_0 positions where it matches s_0. But generating all such codes is equivalent to selecting exactly c_0 positions where x matches s_0, and the remaining (n - c_0) positions must differ.

But how?

Alternatively, for each position j, x can either match s_0[j] or not. The total number of matches must be c_0.

So, the number of possible codes x for the first constraint is C(n, c_0) multiplied by (for each of the c_0 positions, you choose to match, and for the others, you choose to differ). Wait, no: once you choose exactly c_0 positions where x matches s_0, the bits in those positions are fixed (equal to s_0's bits), and the remaining positions must be the opposite of s_0's bits. Because in those positions, x must differ from s_0.

Wait, yes! Because for x to have exactly c_0 matches with s_0, you need to select exactly c_0 positions where x is equal to s_0, and the remaining (n - c_0) positions must be different. So for each such subset of c_0 positions, x is determined as follows: in the subset positions, x's bits are same as s_0's, and in the others, they are flipped.

So generating all possible x's that satisfy the first constraint can be done by generating all possible combinations of c_0 positions (out of n) and setting x to match s_0 in those positions and differ in others.

But the problem is that for c_0 up to 5, the number of such combinations is C(n, c_0), which for n=35 is manageable. For example:

C(35,0) = 1 (but if c_0=0, then x is the inverse of s_0 in all bits).

C(35,5) is 324,632.

So if m is up to 10, and the first constraint's possible candidates are up to 3e5, then for each candidate, checking the remaining m-1 constraints (each requiring a count of matches) is feasible.

But how to generate these candidates efficiently?

Wait, the first candidate's code x is determined by the set of positions where it matches s_0. So for each subset of c_0 positions, the code x can be generated by flipping the bits of s_0 in all positions except those in the subset. But wait, no: in the subset positions, x is equal to s_0, and elsewhere, it's flipped.

So, for example, s_0 is '000000', and c_0=2. Then x must have exactly 2 positions where it is 0, and the other 4 positions must be 1. So each subset of 2 positions defines a unique x, where those positions are 0 and others are 1.

So the idea is:

1. Generate all possible x candidates that satisfy the first constraint (s_0 and c_0). The number of such candidates is C(n, c_0), which could be up to 3e5 when n=35 and c_0=5.

2. For each such x candidate, check whether it satisfies all other constraints (i.e., for each i >=1, the number of matches with s_i is exactly c_i).

3. Count the number of x candidates that pass all these checks.

The problem is that generating these x candidates may be time-consuming if n is 35 and c_0 is up to 5. But generating all combinations of c_0 positions out of 35 can be done using itertools.combinations in Python. However, for 35 choose 5, which is 324,632 combinations, this is manageable.

But for each combination, generating the corresponding x may take O(n) time. For 3e5 combinations and n=35, this is 1e7 operations, which is acceptable.

Then, for each x candidate, check m-1 constraints, each of which requires O(n) time to compute the number of matches with s_i. So for 3e5 * 10 * 35 = 1e7 operations. Which is acceptable.

But wait, the candidate x is generated as a bitstring (e.g., a string of 0s and 1s), but comparing to each s_i (which is a string) could be optimized by precomputing for each s_i the positions where it differs from s_0. Or perhaps precompute for each s_i the bits, and for a candidate x (represented as a bitmask or a list of bits), compute the number of matches with each s_i.

But the key is to make the per-check as efficient as possible.

Let's outline the steps:

First, read all m attempts. For each attempt, store the binary string and the ci.

Then, process the first attempt (s_0, c_0). Generate all possible x candidates that match s_0 in exactly c_0 positions.

For each such x, check for all other attempts (s_i, c_i) whether the number of matches between x and s_i is exactly c_i. If all are satisfied, count this x as valid.

The count of all valid x is the answer.

But how to generate x efficiently?

An optimized approach:

Generate the positions where x matches s_0. For each subset of c_0 positions, x in those positions is same as s_0, and in other positions, it's the opposite.

But in Python, generating all possible combinations and building the x strings can be time-consuming. So perhaps we can represent x as a bitmask (integer) and compute the matches using bitwise operations.

But for n=35, the bitmask can be represented as an integer (since 35 bits fit in a 64-bit integer).

So here's the plan:

1. Convert each s_i into a bitmask (integer) and store it.

2. For the first attempt s_0 (bitmask), generate all possible subsets of c_0 bits where x matches s_0. For each subset, the x bitmask is:

   x_mask = (s_0_mask & subset_mask) | (~s_0_mask & ~subset_mask) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think: For the subset of positions where x matches s_0, x has the same bit as s_0. For other positions, x has the opposite bit.

So, to compute x_mask:

subset_mask is a mask with 1s in the positions where x matches s_0.

Then, x_mask would be (s_0_mask & subset_mask) | (~s_0_mask & (~subset_mask)).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:

For each bit position j:

If the subset_mask has a 1 in position j (meaning x matches s_0 here), then x's bit is s_0's bit.

If subset_mask has 0 in position j, then x's bit is the opposite of s_0's.

So x_mask can be calculated as:

x_mask = (s_0_mask & subset_mask) | (~s_0_mask & (~subset_mask & full_mask)) ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute x_mask by flipping s_0_mask and then applying the subset_mask.

Wait, another way: x_mask is equal to s_0_mask XOR (the positions where x differs from s_0).

The positions where x differs from s_0 are all positions not in the subset.

So, the mask of differing positions is (all positions) XOR subset.

So, x_mask = s_0_mask XOR (full_mask ^ subset_mask) ?

Because:

For each bit j in s_0_mask, if j is in the subset (x matches s_0), then the XOR with (full_mask ^ subset_mask) would flip the bits that are not in the subset.

Wait, perhaps:

s_0_mask XOR (full_mask ^ subset_mask) ?

But full_mask is a mask with all bits set. For example, for n=6, full_mask is 0b111111.

Let me take an example:

Suppose s_0_mask is 000000 (binary), c_0 is 2. So subset_mask is a mask with exactly 2 bits set. For example, bits 0 and 1. subset_mask is 0b000011.

full_mask ^ subset_mask is 0b111111 ^ 0b000011 = 0b111100.

Then, s_0_mask XOR (full_mask ^ subset_mask) is 0b111100. So x is 111100, which has 2 bits set (positions 0 and 1 of x are 0, same as s_0. The rest are 1, different from s_0. So the number of matches is 2. Correct.

Another example: s_0_mask is 010100 (binary 010100), and subset_mask is 0b000011 (positions 0 and 1). Then, full_mask ^ subset_mask is 0b111111 ^ 0b000011 = 0b111100. s_0_mask XOR 0b111100 is 0b010100 ^ 0b111100 = 0b101000. So x is 101000. So the bits where x matches s_0 are positions 0 and 1? Wait, s_0 is 010100, x is 101000. So positions where they match: looking at each bit:

s_0: 0 1 0 1 0 0

x:    1 0 1 0 0 0 ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe my approach for generating x_mask is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute x_mask as follows:

For each position j:

if j is in subset_mask (i.e., x matches s_0 here), then x's j-th bit is s_0's j-th bit.

else, x's j-th bit is 1 - s_0's j-th bit.

So, x_mask can be built by:

For the subset, set bits where x matches s_0. For other bits, set the opposite.

So, the mask can be computed as:

x_mask = (s_0_mask & subset_mask) | ((~s_0_mask) & (~subset_mask)) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think:

For a given j:

If j is in subset_mask:

x_j = s_0_j.

So, in bitmask terms, this is (s_0_mask & subset_mask) for those bits.

For j not in subset_mask:

x_j = 1 - s_0_j.

But how to compute that. If s_0_j is 0, x_j is 1. If s_0_j is 1, x_j is 0.

So, this is equivalent to ~s_0_j (flipping the bits) in those positions.

So, for j not in subset_mask:

x_j = (s_0_j ^ 1).

So, the mask for those bits is (s_0_mask ^ full_mask) & (~subset_mask).

Thus, x_mask is:

(s_0_mask & subset_mask) | ((s_0_mask ^ full_mask) & (~subset_mask)).

But s_0_mask ^ full_mask is the same as ~s_0_mask (assuming that full_mask has all bits set for the first n positions). So, x_mask can be written as:

x_mask = (s_0 & subset) | ((~s_0) & (~subset)).

But since in Python, integers are treated as two's complement, we need to make sure that the mask only considers the first n bits. So perhaps full_mask is a mask with the first n bits set.

Yes. So first, we compute full_mask as (1 << n) - 1. Then:

x_mask = ( (s_0_mask & subset) | ((~s_0_mask) & (~subset)) ) & full_mask.

This ensures that only the first n bits are considered.

So, given s_0_mask and a subset (represented as a bitmask with exactly c_0 bits set), we can compute x_mask using this formula.

Now, the next step is to generate all possible subset masks that have exactly c_0 bits set. Each subset corresponds to a combination of c_0 positions. For each such subset, compute x_mask as above.

Once x_mask is generated, for each of the other m-1 attempts (s_i, c_i), we need to compute the number of bits where x_mask matches s_i_mask, and check if it equals c_i.

But how to compute the number of matching bits between x_mask and s_i_mask?

The number of matching bits is equal to n minus the Hamming distance between x_mask and s_i_mask. The Hamming distance is the number of differing bits, which can be computed as bin( (x_mask ^ s_i_mask) ).count('1').

So for each x_mask generated from the first constraint, compute for all i >=1:

count = n - bin( (x_mask ^ s_i_mask) ).bit_count()

If count == c_i for all i, then this x_mask is valid.

So the plan is:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read m pairs of (s, c). Convert each s into a bitmask (integer). Store s_masks and c_list.

3. Take the first s_mask and c0.

4. Generate all possible subset masks with exactly c0 bits set. For each subset:

   a. Compute x_mask using the formula above.

   b. For each i from 1 to m-1:

      i. Compute the number of matching bits between x_mask and s_masks[i].

      ii. If any of these counts is not equal to c_list[i], reject this x_mask.

   c. If all counts match, increment the answer.

5. Return the total count.

But generating all subsets with exactly c0 bits is the critical part. For n=35 and c0 up to 5, this is manageable.

But how to generate all subsets with exactly c0 bits in Python.

We can use itertools.combinations to generate all combinations of c0 positions (from 0 to n-1), then for each combination, create the subset mask by setting those bits.

For example, for a combination of positions [0, 2, 3], the subset_mask is (1 << 0) | (1 << 2) | (1 << 3).

But generating all combinations for 35 choose 5 is feasible. For example:

For n=35, c0=5: combinations are 35C5= 324,632.

In Python, generating these combinations with itertools.combinations may take some time, but it's manageable.

So the steps in code would be:

- Precompute full_mask = (1 << n) - 1.

- For each combination in combinations(range(n), c0):

   - Create subset_mask by OR'ing 1 << j for each j in the combination.

   - Compute x_mask as ( (s0_mask & subset_mask) | ((~s0_mask) & (~subset_mask)) ) & full_mask.

   - For each other (s_i_mask, c_i), compute (x_mask ^ s_i_mask).bit_count().

   - If all (n - count) == c_i, increment the result.

But wait, for x_mask ^ s_i_mask, the number of set bits is the number of differing positions. So the number of matching positions is n - (x_mask ^ s_i_mask).bit_count().

So for each i, check if n - (x_mask ^ s_i_mask).bit_count() == c_i.

Now, some optimizations:

- Precompute all the s_masks and c_list.

- Precompute full_mask.

- For each combination, generate the subset_mask and compute x_mask.

- Then, for each i in 1..m-1, compute the hamming distance between x_mask and s_i_mask. Then check if the count is correct.

But in Python, for large n=35, using integers to represent masks is efficient. Also, the bit_count() method (Python 3.10+) is very fast.

Another optimization: If m is 0 (but m >=1 according to constraints), but according to the input, m can be 1.

So, code steps:

Read n, m.

Read m lines, for each line:

   s is the binary string. Convert to integer mask.

   c is the integer.

So, for example, '000000' becomes 0, '010100' becomes 0b010100 = 20.

Store s_masks and c_list.

s0_mask = s_masks[0], c0 = c_list[0]

Then, generate all combinations of c0 positions from 0 to n-1.

For each combination:

   subset_mask = sum(1 << j for j in combination)

   x_mask = ( (s0_mask & subset_mask) | ( (~s0_mask) & (~subset_mask) ) ) & full_mask

   Then, check for each i in 1..m-1:

       if (n - (x_mask ^ s_masks[i]).bit_count()) != c_list[i], break.

   If all pass, increment count.

Now, how to generate the combinations.

In Python, itertools.combinations can handle this.

But for n=35 and c0=5, the number of combinations is 324,632, which is manageable.

Now, code example:

import itertools

n, m = map(int, input().split())

s_masks = []
c_list = []
for _ in range(m):
    s, c = input().split()
    c = int(c)
    mask = int(s, 2)
    s_masks.append(mask)
    c_list.append(c)

if m ==0:
    print(0)
    exit()

s0 = s_masks[0]
c0 = c_list[0]

full_mask = (1 << n) - 1

result =0

from itertools import combinations

for bits in combinations(range(n), c0):
    subset_mask = 0
    for bit in bits:
        subset_mask |= 1 << bit
    
    # compute x_mask
    x = (s0 & subset_mask) | (~s0 & (full_mask ^ subset_mask))
    x &= full_mask  # mask to n bits
    
    valid = True
    for i in range(1, m):
        s_i = s_masks[i]
        required = c_list[i]
        xor = x ^ s_i
        cnt = xor.bit_count()
        if (n - cnt) != required:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        result +=1

print(result)

Wait, but wait. Let's test the first sample input.

Sample 1:

Input:

6 2

000000 2

010100 4

So, s0 is 0, c0 is 2.

The code generates all combinations of 2 bits (positions) from 6 bits (0-5).

Each subset_mask has 2 bits set.

Then, x is (0 & subset_mask) | ( ~0 & (full_mask ^ subset_mask) )

~0 is all 1's, but in Python, it's negative, so we need to mask.

Wait, in Python, ~0 is -1 (binary ...11111111). But when we do (full_mask ^ subset_mask), for 6 bits, full_mask is 0b111111.

So, full_mask ^ subset_mask is subset_mask XOR 0b111111.

But subset_mask has exactly 2 bits set. So full_mask ^ subset_mask will have 6-2=4 bits set.

Then, ~0 is -1, but when we compute (~0) & (full_mask ^ subset_mask), since (full_mask ^ subset_mask) is 0b111111 ^ subset_mask, and subset_mask is 2 bits, then this is 4 bits set. But when & with ~0 (all bits set), it's same as (full_mask ^ subset_mask). So:

x = (0 & subset_mask) | ( (full_mask ^ subset_mask) )

But 0 & subset_mask is 0. So x is (full_mask ^ subset_mask). For example, subset_mask is 0b000011 (bits 0 and 1), then full_mask ^ subset_mask is 0b111100. So x is 0b111100.

Which is 111100. The number of matches with s0 (000000) is 2 (positions 0 and 1 are 0 in x), correct.

Then, for the second attempt, s_i is 010100 (binary 20), and required c_i is 4.

The code computes x ^ s_i: 111100 ^ 010100 = 101000. Which has 2 bits set. So the number of differing bits is 2. So the number of matches is 6 -2 =4, which matches c_i. So this x is valid.

So this combination would be counted, contributing to the result.

In the sample input, the answer is 6. Which implies that there are 6 such x's that meet both constraints. So the code would generate 6 valid candidates.

So the code seems correct.

But what about performance?

In Python, the combinations are generated efficiently. For 35 choose 5, it's 324k combinations. For each combination, generating the subset_mask is O(c0) steps. Then, for each m-1 constraints, each step is O(1) (bit operations and bit_count).

Assuming that for each combination, m-1 steps are O(1), then for 324k combinations and m=10, it's 324k *9 steps. Which is about 3 million steps. That's manageable within 5 seconds.

But in Python, even 1e6 operations can take a second. So 3e5 * 10 * 35 could be 1e7 operations, which is manageable.

Another optimization: Precompute all the s_masks and c_list for i >=1. Then, for each x_mask, precompute the required counts for each i.

But the code as written is already efficient.

Now, the code may have some issues with handling the mask correctly. For example, when subset_mask is built using combinations, but for n=35, the code uses integers which are up to 2^35. But Python handles big integers well, albeit with some memory and speed overhead.

Another possible optimization is to represent the subset_mask as an integer, which is built by setting the bits in the combination. For example, for a combination (0, 1, 2), subset_mask is 0b111 (assuming n >=3), but for combinations of 5 bits in n=35, subset_mask is up to 2^35-1.

But in Python, this is manageable.

Another thing to consider: when c0 is zero. For example, if the first attempt has c0=0. Then, the code would generate combinations of 0 bits. Which is a single combination (empty set), subset_mask is 0. Then, x_mask is (0 & 0) | (~0 & (full_mask ^ 0)) ) & full_mask. Which is (0) | ( (full_mask) ) & full_mask. So x_mask is full_mask. Which is all 1's. So for example, if s0 is 000000 and c0=0, then x is 111111. Which has 0 matches with s0. Correct.

Similarly for other c0 values.

So the code should handle all cases.

So this approach should work.
