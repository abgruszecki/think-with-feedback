Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of ordered pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j and the absolute difference between their heights is at most d. Let's think about how to approach this efficiently.

First, the problem says that the order matters. So for each valid pair (a, b), where a and b are different soldiers and their heights differ by at most d, both (a, b) and (b, a) are counted. So the total count will be twice the number of unordered pairs if i and j are considered in order, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the ordered pairs are considered different. So for example, if there are two soldiers with heights 10 and 20, and d is 10, then (1,2) and (2,1) are both valid and counted. So the way to compute this is to find all ordered pairs where i != j and |a[i] - a[j]| <= d.

The constraints are n up to 1000. So the brute-force approach would be O(n²), which for n=1000 is 1e6 operations. That's acceptable because even 1e6 operations are manageable within 2 seconds. But wait, 1e6 operations are about a million, which in Python can take maybe 0.1 seconds. So maybe even a brute force approach would work here. But let's check.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think. If we sort the array, then for each element a[i], we can find the range of elements a[j] where a[j] is between a[i] - d and a[i] + d. For each such a[j], the pair (i, j) would be valid. But since the array is sorted, we can use binary search to find the boundaries.

But wait, the problem requires ordered pairs (i, j) where i and j can be in any order, but they are considered different. However, when we sort the array, the indices are changed, so we can't directly apply this approach. Wait, but perhaps the actual positions in the original array don't matter, only the values. Because the count is based on all possible ordered pairs regardless of their original positions. Wait, no. Because the soldiers are distinct based on their positions. For example, if two soldiers have the same height, then each pair (i,j) where i != j is counted, even if the heights are the same. So in the sorted array, the actual order of processing doesn't affect the count as long as we consider all possible ordered pairs where the difference in their heights is <=d.

But if we sort the array, then for each element, we can find how many elements are within [a[i] - d, a[i] + d], and then subtract 1 (the element itself) and multiply by 1. Then sum all these, but that would count each ordered pair once. Wait, no. Wait, suppose after sorting, the array is sorted. For each position i, the elements j where a[j] is within [a[i]-d, a[i]+d] and j != i. For each such j, the ordered pair (i, j) in the original array may be a valid pair. But since the sorted array's indices are not the same as the original, that approach might not work. Because the original array's order is not preserved. So perhaps this approach isn't applicable here. Wait, but maybe the problem counts all possible ordered pairs, regardless of their original positions. So if after sorting, the count of valid pairs (i,j) in the sorted array would be the same as in the original array. But no, that's not true. Because in the original array, there could be multiple soldiers with the same height. For example, if there are three soldiers with heights 10, 10, 10, and d is 0. Then all ordered pairs (i,j) where i != j are valid. The count is 3*2=6. If we sort the array, the sorted array is [10,10,10]. For each element in the sorted array, the number of elements in [10-0, 10+0] is 3, so subtract 1 (the same element) gives 2. Summing 3 elements gives 3*2=6. Which matches the correct count. So this approach works.

So here's the plan:

Sort the array.

For each element in the sorted array, find the number of elements in the array that are between (a[i] - d) and (a[i] + d). Let's call this count as c. Then the number of valid pairs for this element is (c - 1), since we exclude the element itself. Summing this over all elements gives the total number of valid ordered pairs. Because in the sorted array, any pair (i,j) where j is in the allowed range for i will contribute to the sum, and since the array is sorted, the binary search can find the left and right boundaries efficiently.

Wait, but how does that account for ordered pairs (j, i) where i < j but a[j] - a[i] <=d? Because for each element i, we are counting all j's where |a[i] - a[j]| <=d. Since the array is sorted, when i is at position k, the j's can be on either side as long as their value is within the allowed range. So the binary search approach would capture all possible j's for each i, including those j's that are after i. So the sum would correctly count all ordered pairs where the values are within the allowed range, regardless of their positions in the sorted array.

Wait, but the original array's order is irrelevant. The problem counts all possible ordered pairs (i,j) where i != j and the heights' difference is <=d. So the sorted approach works because the sum (c-1) for each i in the sorted array will count all j's (in the original array) that have a value within the allowed range, but in the sorted array. However, the original array's order is not important. Because the sorted array's elements are the same as the original, just ordered. The problem counts all pairs where the two soldiers (regardless of their positions in the original array) have a height difference within d. So the sum (sum of (c_i -1) for all i) will give the correct count. Because each (i,j) pair in the original array where the heights are within d will be counted once in the sorted array as (i',j') where i' is the position in the sorted array. Wait, but the problem is that in the sorted array, each element's count is the number of elements within the allowed range. So for example, in the sorted array, for element a, the number of elements that can pair with it (as j) is (c -1). But when the array is sorted, this counts all j's in the entire array (original indices may vary). But since the problem counts all possible ordered pairs (i,j) in the original array where the heights are within d, then the sorted array approach correctly captures this. Because regardless of how the original array is arranged, the count is based on the values. So even if there are duplicates, the sorted approach will count each pair once for each occurrence.

So this approach should work.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the array.
2. For each element in the sorted array, find the number of elements that are >= (a[i] - d) and <= (a[i] + d). Let's call this count 'count_i'.
3. The number of valid pairs for this element is (count_i - 1), because we subtract the element itself.
4. Sum all (count_i -1) for each element. This gives the total number of valid ordered pairs.

But wait, let's test this with the first example.

First example input:

5 10

10 20 50 60 65

After sorting: [10,20,50,60,65]

For each element:

10: allowed range is 0-20. Elements in [0,20] are 10,20. So count is 2. Subtract 1 gives 1.

20: allowed range is 10-30. Elements are 10,20,50? No. Wait, sorted array is 10,20,50,60,65. 20's allowed range is 10-30. So elements are 10 and 20. So count is 2. Subtract 1: 1.

50: allowed range is 40-60. Elements are 50,60. So count is 2. Subtract 1:1.

60: allowed range is 50-70. Elements are 50,60,65. So count is 3. Subtract 1: 2.

65: allowed range is 55-75. Elements are 60,65. So count is 2. Subtract 1:1.

Summing all (1+1+1+2+1) =6. Which matches the sample output. So yes, this approach works.

Another example:

Input 2:

5 1

55 30 29 31 55

After sorting: 29,30,31,55,55.

For each element:

29: allowed range 28-30. Elements are 29,30. count=2-1=1.

30: allowed 29-31. Elements are 29,30,31. count=3-1=2.

31: allowed 30-32. Elements 30,31. count=2-1=1.

55: allowed 54-56. Elements 55,55. count=2. Subtract 1:1 for each 55. Wait, but there are two 55s. For each 55:

First 55: allowed 54-56. Elements 55 and 55. So count is 2. subtract 1 gives 1.

Second 55: same. So each contributes 1. So total for the two 55s is 2.

So sum is 1+2+1+1+1 =6, which matches the sample.

So this approach works.

Now, the question is how to implement this efficiently. For each element in the sorted array, find the number of elements in [a[i]-d, a[i]+d]. Since the array is sorted, we can use binary search for the left and right boundaries.

In Python, the bisect module can be used. For each a_i, the lower bound is a_i -d, the upper bound is a_i +d.

For the leftmost index where a_j >= (a_i -d), we can use bisect_left. For the rightmost index where a_j <= (a_i +d), we use bisect_right. The count is right_idx - left_idx.

Then subtract 1 if a_i is included in that range (which it always is, since a_i -d <=a_i <= a_i +d). So the count will include a_i, so when we subtract 1 (because we need j !=i), the total pairs for that a_i is (count-1).

So for each element, we compute the number of elements in the interval and subtract 1.

So the steps in code:

- Read n and d.

- Read the array of heights.

- Sort the array.

- For each element in the sorted array, compute the number of elements in [a_i -d, a_i +d], subtract 1, sum all these.

So the code would look something like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import bisect


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, d = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    a.sort()

    total =0

    for num in a:

        left = bisect.bisect_left(a, num -d)

        right = bisect.bisect_right(a, num +d)

        count = right - left

        total += count -1

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
5 1
55 30 29 31 55
""",
            "output": \
"""\
6
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Another test case: the second sample input:

After sorting: 29,30,31,55,55.

For 55 (the first one):

allowed range is 54 to 56.

In the array, the elements >=54 are 55,55. So left is 3 (bisect_left(54) returns 3, since 55 is the first element >=54). bisect_right(56) is 5. So count is 5-3=2. 2-1=1.

Same for the second 55: same calculation. So each contributes 1. So sum is correct.

So the code works for all cases.

Thus, the approach is correct and efficient.

```python
import bisect

n, d = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
total = 0
for num in a:
    left = bisect.bisect_left(a, num - d)
    right = bisect.bisect_right(a, num + d)
    total += right - left - 1
print(total)
```
