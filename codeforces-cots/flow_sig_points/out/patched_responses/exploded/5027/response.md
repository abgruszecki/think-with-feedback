Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the problem is about determining for each query whether a certain subarray of the original array (after rearrangement) can have a sum of zero. The array consists of only 1s and -1s. Hmm.

Let me think. For a segment [li, ri], the sum of the elements in that segment must be zero. But since the elements can be rearranged, the order doesn't matter. So the sum of the elements in that segment must be zero. Wait, no. Wait, rearrangement allows us to arrange the elements in any order, but the sum is the sum of all elements in that segment. Wait, no. The sum of the elements in the segment is fixed. Because rearrangement doesn't change the sum. Oh right! Because when you add numbers, the order doesn't matter. So the sum of the elements in the query's segment must be zero. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, but the answer isn't just checking if the sum is zero. Because the problem says, rearrange the elements of the array so that the sum of the subarray from li to ri is zero. Wait, no. Wait, no. The sum after rearrangement is the same as the original sum. Because sum is commutative. So the sum is fixed. So the sum of the elements in the segment [li, ri] must be zero. Otherwise, the answer is zero. But then why the problem says "can be rearranged"? Oh right, because when the array is rearranged, the subarray from li to ri (positions) would contain the same elements as before, but arranged in any order. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: "the elements of array a can be rearranged so that the sum ali + ... + ari =0". Wait, but rearranging the array elements would change the elements in the subarray [li, ri]. Because the entire array is rearranged, and then we take the elements in positions li to ri. Oh, right! So the sum of the elements in positions li to ri after rearrangement must be zero. But the entire array is rearranged. So the sum of the elements in the query's range after rearrangement is the sum of the elements that are placed in positions li to ri. But those elements could be any subset of the array, right? Wait no. Because when you rearrange the entire array, the elements are permuted, but the counts of 1s and -1s remain the same. So for a query [li, ri], the length of the segment is (ri - li + 1). Let's call this k. Then, the sum of the elements in this segment after rearrangement must be zero. But the sum can be zero only if k is even. Because each 1 and -1 pair cancels each other. So, the sum can be zero only if k is even, and there's an equal number of 1s and -1s in the segment. Wait, but the problem allows us to choose any rearrangement. So the question is, can we arrange the array in such a way that in the subarray [li, ri] (after rearrangement), the sum is zero. But how?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is: For a query [l, r], the length of the subarray is (r - l +1). Let's call this k. The sum of the elements in this subarray after rearrangement must be zero. So the sum is zero if and only if the number of 1s and -1s in that subarray is equal. Because each 1 and -1 pair sums to zero. So, for the sum to be zero, the total number of elements in the subarray must be even (since each pair contributes zero), and the number of 1s and -1s in the subarray must be exactly k/2 each. Wait, no. Because for example, if the subarray has 2 elements, then one must be 1 and the other -1. So sum is zero. So the total number of 1s in the subarray must equal the number of -1s. Which implies that k must be even, and the total count of 1s in the entire array must be at least (k/2), and the count of -1s must be at least (k/2), but considering the entire array? Wait, no. Wait, because in the subarray, the elements can be arranged. So the sum is zero only if the total number of 1s in the subarray (after rearrangement) is equal to the number of -1s. But the elements in the subarray after rearrangement are the same as the elements in that subarray before rearrangement, but reordered. Wait, no. Wait, when you rearrange the entire array, the subarray [l, r] refers to the elements in positions l to r of the rearranged array. So those elements are a subset of the entire array. Wait, no. The entire array is a permutation of the original array, so all elements are present. The subarray [l, r] is a contiguous sequence in the rearranged array. So the sum of the elements in that subarray is the sum of the elements in that contiguous part. But the problem allows us to choose any rearrangement (permutation) of the entire array. So for each query, we need to determine if there exists a permutation of the array such that the sum of the elements in positions l to r (in the permutation) is zero.

So the problem reduces to: For the query [l, r], can we arrange the array such that the sum of the elements in positions l..r is zero. How to model this?

Hmm. Let's think about what's required for this sum to be zero. The sum of the elements in the l..r positions must be zero. Let the number of elements in this range be k = r - l +1. So the sum of these k elements is zero. Since each element is 1 or -1, the sum is (number of 1s) - (number of -1s) = 0. So number of 1s must equal the number of -1s. So k must be even, and the count of 1s in the l..r positions is k/2, and same for -1s.

But the permutation can arrange the elements in any way. So the question is: Can we select k elements from the entire array (since the permutation can arrange any elements in the l..r positions) such that exactly half are 1s and half are -1s, and the remaining elements (in positions outside l..r) can be arranged in any way.

Wait, because the permutation can arrange the entire array. So the l..r positions in the permutation can contain any k elements (since the permutation is a rearrangement of all elements). So, for the sum to be zero in positions l..r of the permutation, the number of 1s in those k positions must be exactly k/2. So the problem becomes: For the query [l, r], is it possible that the entire array has at least (k/2) 1s and at least (k/2) -1s (since we need k/2 1s and k/2 -1s in the l..r positions). Wait, but the total number of 1s in the entire array is fixed. Let's call total_ones the number of 1s in the array, total_neg_ones the number of -1s (which is n - total_ones). So, for a query of length k, to have a sum of zero, two conditions must be met:

1. k must be even. Because otherwise, it's impossible to split into equal numbers of 1s and -1s.

2. The total number of 1s in the array must be at least k/2, and the total number of -1s must be at least k/2. Because we need to select k/2 1s and k/2 -1s to place in the l..r positions.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the entire array has total_ones 1s and total_neg_ones -1s. To have exactly (k/2) 1s and (k/2) -1s in the l..r positions, the array must have at least (k/2) 1s and at least (k/2) -1s. Because those 1s and -1s are part of the entire array.

So for a query [l, r], the answer is 1 if and only if:

- k is even.

AND

- (total_ones >= k/2) AND (total_neg_ones >= k/2).

Wait, that's the key insight. Because the permutation can arrange any elements in the l..r positions. So the problem reduces to: can we choose k elements (the ones in the l..r positions of the permutation) such that exactly k/2 are 1s and k/2 are -1s. Because the sum of those is zero.

But how does that selection affect the rest of the array? Well, the rest of the array (the elements not in l..r) can be arranged in any order. So the main constraints are whether the entire array has enough 1s and -1s to provide k/2 of each in the selected positions. So the answer for a query is yes if and only if:

k is even, and the total number of 1s in the array is >= k/2, and the total number of -1s is >= k/2.

Because even if the entire array has more 1s than needed, but as long as we have at least k/2 of each, we can select exactly k/2 1s and k/2 -1s for the l..r positions, and leave the rest in the other positions.

So the steps for solving this problem would be:

1. Precompute the total number of 1s and -1s in the array.

2. For each query [l, r], compute k = r - l + 1.

3. Check if k is even. If not, output 0.

4. Else, check if (total_ones >= k/2) AND (total_neg_ones >= k/2). If yes, output 1; else, output 0.

Wait, but why does the actual positions of l and r not matter? Because the permutation allows us to arrange the elements in any order. So the positions l and r are just the positions in the rearranged array. So, regardless of where l and r are in the array, as long as the length of the segment is k, and the total counts of 1s and -1s in the entire array are sufficient, then we can arrange the array such that the l..r segment contains exactly k/2 1s and k/2 -1s. So the actual positions of l and r in the original array are irrelevant. The answer depends only on the length of the query segment and the total counts of 1s and -1s in the entire array.

So for example, in the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

2 3

1 -1

Queries:

1 1: k=1 (odd) → output 0.

1 2: k=2 even. total_ones = 1, total_neg_ones=1. So k/2=1. 1 >=1 and 1 >=1 → yes. Output 1.

2 2: k=1 → 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

Sample Input 2:

5 5

-1 1 1 1 -1

Total_ones: 3 (elements 2,3,4). Total_neg_ones: 2 (elements 1 and 5).

Queries:

1 1 → k=1 → 0.

2 3 → k=2. Need 1 one and 1 neg. But total_ones is 3 >=1, total_neg is 2 >=1. So yes. Output 1.

3 5 → k=3 (odd) → 0.

2 5 → k=4. Need 2 ones and 2 negs. Total_ones is 3 >=2, total_neg is 2 >=2 → yes. So output 1.

1 5 → k=5 (odd) → 0.

Which matches the sample output.

So this approach works. So the problem reduces to for each query, checking if k is even and the counts of 1s and -1s in the entire array are at least k/2 each.

Therefore, the steps to solve the problem are:

- Read n and m.

- Read the array a.

- Compute total_ones = number of 1s in a. total_neg_ones = n - total_ones.

- For each query, compute k = r - l +1.

- If k is odd → output 0.

- Else:

   required = k // 2.

   if total_ones >= required and total_neg_ones >= required → output 1.

   else → output 0.

So the solution is O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for the constraints (n and m up to 2e5).

Now, the code can be written as:

Read n and m.

Then the array: list(map(int, input().split())) → then count the number of 1s.

Then for m queries:

each line gives l and r. Compute k = r - l +1.

if k % 2 !=0 → 0.

else:

required = k//2

if (total_ones >= required) and (total_neg_ones >= required) → 1 else 0.

But wait, total_neg_ones is (n - total_ones). So perhaps in code, we can compute total_ones, then total_neg = n - total_ones.

Yes.

So code:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_ones = a.count(1)

total_neg = len(a) - total_ones

for _ in range(m):

    l, r = map(int, input().split())

    k = r - l + 1

    if k % 2 !=0:

        print(0)

    else:

        required = k //2

        if total_ones >= required and total_neg >= required:

            print(1)

        else:

            print(0)

Yes. Let's test this code against the samples.

Sample 1:

Input:

2 3

1 -1

Queries:

1 1 → k=1 → 0.

1 2 → k=2 → required 1 each. total_ones=1, total_neg=1 → yes →1.

Sample 2:

Array: [-1,1,1,1,-1] → count 3 ones. total_neg=5-3=2.

Queries:

1 1 → k=1 →0.

2 3 → k=2 → required 1. 3 >=1 and 2 >=1 →1.

3 5 → k=3 →0.

2 5 → k=4 → required 2. total_ones=3 >=2, total_neg=2 >=2 →1.

1 5 → k=5 →0.

Which matches the sample outputs.

So this code should be correct.

Now, considering the constraints. n and m can be up to 2e5, and this code is O(n + m), which is acceptable.

The code uses minimal memory, only storing the counts, not the array (well, the array is stored in a list, but that's unavoidable as per the input method).

But in Python, for very large n (2e5), reading the array via input().split() and then a.count(1) is O(n) time. Which is acceptable.

Yes. So this is the optimal solution.

n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
total_ones = a.count(1)
total_neg = n - total_ones
for _ in range(m):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    k = r - l + 1
    if k % 2:
        print(0)
    else:
        required = k // 2
        print(1 if total_ones >= required and total_neg >= required else 0)
