Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining how many possible x values (from 00 to 99) are "good" given a certain displayed number n. The idea is that the actual x might have some broken sticks, leading the display to show n instead. So we need to find all x where x could be the intended number, and when displayed with some broken sticks (possibly none), it looks like n.

First, I need to model how each digit is displayed with the 7-segment display. Each digit has a certain pattern of segments that are lit. For example, the digit 0 uses all segments except the middle one (assuming the standard 7-segment layout). So maybe I should create a map that tells which segments are lit for each digit.

Wait, right. So each digit (0-9) has a set of segments that are on. Then, for each x (a two-digit number), we compare it to the displayed n (two digits). The x is considered good if for each of the two digits, the segments that are lit in x's digit are a superset of those in n's digit. Because broken sticks are the ones that are supposed to be on but are off. So when x's digit has a segment lit, the display must also show that segment as lit. So any segment that is on in n's digit must be on in x's digit. Otherwise, the display would have to turn off a segment that should be on, which isn't possible if the stick is broken (since broken sticks can't be turned on again).

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that some sticks are broken. The broken sticks are those that are stuck off. So, when x is the actual number, the display shows a number n where each segment that is on in n must be a subset of the segments that are on in x. Because any segment that's supposed to be on in x (as part of the digit) might have some broken (stuck off) segments. So, the segments that are lit in n must be a subset of those in x. Because the broken segments (the ones that are off) in x's digit would cause the display to not light up those segments. So for x to be a possible candidate, every segment that is lit in n's digit must also be lit in x's digit. Because if x's digit has a segment turned on, but the display's segment is off, that's impossible. So the display's segments can only have segments that are on if x's digit has those segments on. Otherwise, you can't get that.

So for each digit in x (the actual number), the segments that are on must include all the segments that are on in the corresponding digit of n. Because the broken segments are those that are off. So, the displayed digit n's segments can't have any segments that are on if x's digit doesn't have them on. So the x's digit's segments must be a superset of the displayed digit's segments.

So the approach is:

For each possible x (00 to 99), check each of the two digits. For each digit position (tens and units), the x's digit must have all the segments that are lit in n's digit. If this is true for both digits, then x is a good integer.

So first, we need to model the segments for each digit. Let's define the 7 segments as a bitmask. For example, each digit can be represented by a 7-bit number, where each bit represents a segment. Let's choose a convention for which bit represents which segment. The standard 7-segment layout has segments a to g arranged in a particular way. Let's say:

Segments are arranged as follows (using the standard lettering):

 a 
f b
 g 
e c
 d 

Wait, maybe I should look up the standard 7-segment representation. Let me recall: The standard segments are usually labeled a (top), b (upper right), c (lower right), d (bottom), e (upper left), f (lower left), g (middle). Each digit is formed by lighting certain segments:

0 uses segments a, b, c, d, e, f (all except g)
1 uses b, c
2 uses a, b, g, e, d
3 uses a, b, g, c, d
4 uses f, g, b, c
5 uses a, f, g, c, d
6 uses a, f, g, c, d, e
7 uses a, b, c
8 uses all segments
9 uses a, b, c, d, f, g

So each digit's segments can be represented as a set. Let's create a list or a dictionary where each digit (0-9) has a set of active segments.

For example:

digit_segments = {
    0: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'},  # missing g
    1: {'b', 'c'},
    2: {'a', 'b', 'g', 'e', 'd'},
    3: {'a', 'b', 'g', 'c', 'd'},
    4: {'f', 'g', 'b', 'c'},
    5: {'a', 'f', 'g', 'c', 'd'},
    6: {'a', 'f', 'g', 'c', 'd', 'e'},
    7: {'a', 'b', 'c'},
    8: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'},
    9: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g'},
}

Alternatively, since each segment can be represented as a bitmask. Let's assign each segment a bit position. For example:

a: 1 << 0 (bit 0)
b: 1 << 1 (bit 1)
c: 1 << 2 (bit 2)
d: 1 << 3 (bit 3)
e: 1 << 4 (bit 4)
f: 1 << 5 (bit 5)
g: 1 << 6 (bit 6)

Then each digit can be represented as the OR of the bits corresponding to its active segments.

So for 0: a, b, c, d, e, f. So bits 0,1,2,3,4,5. So mask is 0b111111 (63) but let's calculate:

a (bit 0) is 1
b (1) is 2
c (2) is4
d (3) is8
e (4) is16
f (5) is 32
g (6) is64.

So 0's mask is 1 + 2 +4 +8 +16 +32 = 63.

Wait:

1 << 0 = 1 (a)
1 << 1 = 2 (b)
1 << 2 =4 (c)
1 <<3 =8 (d)
1 <<4=16 (e)
1 <<5=32 (f)
1 <<6=64 (g)

So let's compute for each digit:

0: a, b, c, d, e, f → bits 0-5 → 1+2+4+8+16+32 =63 → 0b111111 → 63.

1: b, c → 2+4=6.

2: a, b, g, e, d → bits 0,1,6,4,3 → 1 +2 +64 +16 +8 = 91? Let's see: 1+2=3, 3+8=11, 11+16=27, 27+64=91. So 91.

3: a, b, g, c, d → bits 0,1,6,2,3 → 1+2+4+8 +64 → 79.

4: f, g, b, c → bits 5,6,1,2 → 32+64 +2+4 = 102.

5: a, f, g, c, d → bits 0,5,6,2,3 → 1 +32 +64 +4 +8 = 109.

6: a, f, g, c, d, e → bits 0,5,6,2,3,4 → 1+32+64+4+8+16= 125.

7: a, b, c → bits 0,1,2 → 7.

8: all bits → 127 (63+64=127, since 0 is 63 plus g (64) makes 127).

9: a, b, c, d, f, g → bits 0,1,2,3,5,6 → 1+2+4+8+32+64= 111.

So the masks for each digit would be:

digit_masks = [63, 6, 91, 79, 102, 109, 125, 7, 127, 111]

So for each digit in n (tens and units place), we can get their masks. Then, for each possible x (0-99), split into tens and units digits. For each of those digits, check if the mask of x's digit includes all the bits set in n's digit. In other words, x_digit_mask & n_digit_mask == n_digit_mask. Because that would mean all segments that are on in n's digit are also on in x's digit.

So the steps are:

1. Read the input as a two-digit string, possibly with leading zero. So n is a two-digit number (like '89', '00', etc.)

2. Split into two digits: first_digit (tens) and second_digit (units). So for '89', first is 8, second is 9.

3. For each possible x in 0..99:

   a. Split x into tens (x_tens) and units (x_units) digits. For example, x=5 would be 05, so x_tens=0, x_units=5.

   b. Check if for the tens digit of x (x_tens), its mask includes all the bits of the n's tens digit mask. Similarly for the units.

   c. If both digits pass, then x is a good integer.

4. Count all such x.

Now, how to model this in code.

First, precompute the digit_masks as a list, where index is the digit (0-9), value is the mask.

Then, for each x in 0 to 99:

   x_str = f"{x:02d}"

   x_tens = int(x_str[0])

   x_units = int(x_str[1])

   get the mask for x_tens and check if (x_tens_mask & n_tens_mask) == n_tens_mask.

   Similarly for x_units.

   If both are true, count +=1.

So the code can be structured as:

- Precompute the masks.

- Read n as a two-digit string.

- Split into two digits: n_tens and n_units.

- Get their masks.

- Iterate over all x from 0 to 99, split into x_tens and x_units.

- For each, check if (x_tens_mask & n_tens_mask) == n_tens_mask and (x_units_mask & n_units_mask) == n_units_mask.

- If yes, increment count.

But wait, the problem states that the displayed number is n. So x's digit must have all segments that are on in the displayed digit. For example, if n's tens digit is 8 (mask 127), then x's tens digit must also be 8, because 8's mask is all 1s. Because any x's tens digit must have a mask that includes all the segments of n's tens digit. So if the mask of n's tens digit is 127 (all bits set), then x's tens digit mask must also be 127. Which only 8 has. So in that case, x's tens digit must be 8.

So the code for checking each digit is: (x's mask) AND (n's mask) must equal n's mask. Which is equivalent to (x's mask) includes all bits set in n's mask.

So in code:

mask_x_tens = digit_masks[x_tens]

if (mask_x_tens & n_tens_mask) != n_tens_mask:

   skip.

Same for units.

So the steps are:

Compute n_tens_mask and n_units_mask.

For each x in 0..99:

   x_tens = x // 10

   x_units = x % 10

   mask_xt = digit_masks[x_tens]

   mask_xu = digit_masks[x_units]

   if (mask_xt & n_tens_mask) == n_tens_mask and (mask_xu & n_units_mask) == n_units_mask:

      count +=1

So now, the code structure is clear.

Now, let's precompute the digit_masks.

digit_masks = [
    0b111111,   #0: 63
    0b000110,   #1: 6
    0b1011011,  #2: 91 (binary 1011011 is 91)
    0b1001111,  #3: 79 (1001111 is 79)
    0b1100110,  #4: 102
    0b1101101,  #5: 109
    0b1111101,  #6: 125
    0b0000111,  #7:7
    0b1111111,  #8:127
    0b1101111,  #9:111
]

Wait, let me verify the masks again:

Digit 0: 63 → 0b111111 (6 bits). Yes.

Digit 1: 6 → 0b000110. Yes.

Digit 2: 91 in binary is 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 → 64+16=80 +8=88 +2=90 +1=91. So binary 1011011 (since 64 is 64 (bit 6), then 16 is bit 4, 8 is bit 3, 2 is bit 1, 1 is bit 0). So 1011011 (binary 91) is correct.

Digit 3: 79. Let's see: 64 + 8 + 7 (64+8=72, 72+7=79). Wait, 64 is bit 6, 8 is bit 3. Then 7 is 4+2+1 (bits 2,1,0). Wait, 64 (bit6) + 8 (bit3) + 4 (bit2) + 2 (bit1) + 1 (bit0) = 64 +8=72 +4=76 +2=78 +1=79. So binary is 1001111 (bit6 is 1, bits 3-0 are 1111, bits 5 and 4 are 0). Yes, that's 79.

Digit4: 102. Let's break down: 64 (bit6) + 32 (bit5) + 4 (bit2) + 2 (bit1) → 64+32=96 +4=100 +2=102 → binary 1100110 (bits6:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1; others 0). So yes.

Digit5: 109. 64 (bit6) + 32 (bit5) + 8 (bit3) +4 (bit2) + 1 (bit0) → 64+32=96 +8=104 +4=108 +1=109. So binary is 1101101. Yes.

Digit6: 125. 64+32=96, 16=112, 8=120, 4=124, +1=125. Wait, 64 (bit6) + 32 (bit5) + 16 (bit4) + 8 (bit3) +4 (bit2) + 1 (bit0) → 64+32=96 +16=112 +8=120 +4=124 +1=125. So binary is 1111101. Yes.

Digit7: 7 → 0b0000111 (bits 0-2). Correct.

Digit8: 127 → 0b1111111. Correct.

Digit9: 111. Let's see: 64+32=96 + 8=104 +4=108 + 2=110 +1=111. So 64 (bit6), 32 (bit5), 8 (bit3), 4 (bit2), 2 (bit1), 1 (bit0). Binary 1101111 (bits6,5,3,2,1,0 → 1101111 is 111 in decimal). Wait, 1101111 in binary is:

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 → 64 +32 +8 +4 +2 +1 = 107? Wait no. Wait 64 is 64, 32 is 32, 8 is 8, 4 is4, 2 is2, 1 is1. Sum 64+32=96+8=104+4=108+2=110+1=111. So yes. But 64 (bit6 is 1), 32 (bit5 is1), 8 (bit3 is 1), 4 (bit2 is1), 2 (bit1 is1), 1 (bit0 is1). So binary is 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 → which is 7 bits. So yes, 1101111 is 111. So that's correct.

So the digit_masks array is correctly defined as:

digit_masks = [
    0b111111,   #0 → 63
    0b0000110,  #1 → 6 (binary 0000110 is 6)
    Wait, wait. Wait, 0b000110 is 6. Because 4 + 2 =6. So for digit1, the mask is 6, which is 0b0000110 (but 6 is 0b110 in 3 bits, but in 7 bits it's 0b0000110). So the initial digit_masks may have been written in a way that's leading with zeros. So the digit_masks list should have each digit's mask as the correct integer value.

Wait, the way the code works is that each mask is stored as an integer. So the code can just precompute the masks correctly.

So for example, for digit 1, the mask is 6 (binary 110, but in 7 bits it's 0000110). But when stored as an integer, 6 is 6. So when we do the bitwise AND operation, the code will handle it correctly.

So the digit_masks list is:

digit_masks = [63, 6, 91, 79, 102, 109, 125, 7, 127, 111]

But in Python, numbers can be written in hex or binary. But for clarity, perhaps write them as integers. For example, 63 is 0x3f, but perhaps it's easier to write in decimal.

So the code can have:

digit_masks = [
    63,    # 0
    6,     # 1
    91,    # 2
    79,    # 3
    102,   # 4
    109,   # 5
    125,   # 6
    7,     #7
    127,   #8
    111    #9
]

So that's the array. Now, in code, for each of the two digits in the input n, we get their masks.

Now, the code steps:

Read the input as a two-character string. For example, input '89' → n_tens is 8, n_units is9. So their masks are digit_masks[8] = 127, digit_masks[9]=111.

Then, for each x in 0..99:

x_tens = x //10

x_units = x %10

Check if (digit_masks[x_tens] & n_tens_mask) == n_tens_mask, and similarly for units.

If both, count +=1.

Now, how to handle x when it's a single digit. For example, x=5 → 05. So x_tens is 0, x_units is5.

So, code for x in 0..99:

Yes, that's straightforward.

Now, testing the examples.

First example: input is 89. The displayed digits are 8 and9.

n_tens_mask is 127 (digit 8), n_units_mask is 111 (digit9).

For x to be a good integer, x's tens digit must have a mask that includes all bits of 127 (so only 8's mask is 127). So x_tens must be 8.

x_units must have a mask that includes 111. Which digits have masks that include 111? Let's see:

digit_masks for possible x_units digits:

digit 9: 111 → 111 &111 =111 → okay.

digit 8: 127 → 127&111=111 → yes.

digit 3: 79 → 79 &111 is 79. 79 is not 111. So no.

Wait, for the units digit in the first example (n_units is9, mask 111), x_units must have a mask that includes all the bits set in 111. So x_units_mask must have bits set where 111 has them. Let's see:

111 is 64+32+8+4+2+1= 111. So which digits have a mask that includes all these bits.

Looking at each digit's mask:

digit 0: 63 → binary 00111111. So 63 & 111 is 63, which is less than 111 → no.

digit1:6 → 00000110. &111 is 6 <111 → no.

digit2:91 → 0b1011011 is 91 → binary 1011011. 111 is 0b1101111. So 91 has bits 6,4,3,1,0. 111 has 6,5,3,2,1,0. So 91's bits are 6,4,3,1,0. So 91's mask does not include 5 (bit5) and 2 (bit2) which are set in 111. So 91 &111 is 91 & 0b1101111 (111) → 91 is 0b1011011 → 1011011 & 1101111 = 1001011 → which is 75. Not equal to 111. So no.

digit3:79 → 1001111. 79 in binary is 1001111. 111 is 1101111. So 79 &111 is 1001111 & 1101111 = 1001111 (79), which is not equal to 111. So no.

digit4:102 → 1100110. &111 is 1000010 (66). No.

digit5:109 → 1101101. 109 in binary is 1101101. &111 (1101111) → 1101101 & 1101111 = 1101101 → 109. Which is not 111. So no.

digit6:125 → 1111101. &111 (1101111) → 1101101 → 109. No.

digit7:7 → 0000111. &111 → 0000111 → 7. No.

digit8:127 → 127 &111 is 111 → yes.

digit9:111 → yes.

So the units digit can be 8 or9.

So for the first example, x must have tens digit 8 (since 127 can only be matched by 8), and units digit 8 or9. So possible x's are 88 and89. Hence the output is 2.

Which matches the first example.

Second example: input is 00. So n_tens is 0, mask 63. n_units is 0, mask63.

For x's tens digit, x_tens_mask must include all bits of 63 (0b111111). So x_tens can be any digit whose mask includes 63. Let's see which digits have masks >=63.

digit0:63 → 63. So mask includes all bits in 63 (since 63 &63 =63).

digit8:127 → includes 63.

So x_tens can be 0 or8.

Same for x_units: 0 or8.

So possible x's are 00, 08, 80, 88. So 4, which matches the example.

Third example: input 73. So n_tens is7 (mask7, which is 0b0000111), n_units is3 (mask79, which is 0b1001111).

For x_tens: mask must include 7 (0b0000111). So any digit whose mask includes all bits of 7. Let's see:

Which digits have masks where (x_tens_mask &7) ==7. Because 7 is the mask for n's tens digit (7). So x_tens's mask must have the first three bits set (bits0-2). Let's see which digits have that:

digit0:63 → 63 &7 =7 → yes.

digit1:6 → 6 &7 =6 → not equal to7. No.

digit2:91 → 91 &7 is 3 → no.

digit3:79 → 79 &7=7 → yes.

digit4:102 → 102 in binary is 1100110. &7 is 6 → no.

digit5:109 → 109 is 1101101. &7=5 → no.

digit6:125 → 125 &7=5 → no.

digit7:7 → yes.

digit8:127 → yes.

digit9:111 → 111 &7=7 → yes.

So x_tens can be 0,3,7,8,9.

For the units digit, n_units is3 (mask79, 0b1001111). So the x_units must have a mask that includes all bits of79. 79 in binary is 1001111 (bits6,3,2,1,0). So x_units's mask must have all those bits set.

Which digits have masks that include 79's bits? Let's check each digit:

digit0:63 → 63 in binary is 00111111. So bits5 (32), 4 (16), etc. Bits6 is 0. So 63 &79 =63. 63 <79 → no.

digit1:6 → 6 is 0000110. &79 is 6 → no.

digit2:91 → 1011011 (bits6,4,3,1,0). So 91 &79 is 0011011 (bits3,1,0 and 4? Wait, 91 is 64+16+8+2+1=91. So bits6 (64), 4 (16), 3 (8), 1 (2), 0 (1). 79 is 64 (bit6) + 8 (bit3) + 4 (bit2) + 2 (bit1) + 1 (bit0) → 64+8=72+4=76+2+1=79. So bits6,3,2,1,0. So 91's mask has bits6,4,3,1,0. So 91's mask includes bits6,3,1,0. But 79's mask requires bits6,3,2,1,0. So 91's mask has bit2 not set. So 91's mask &79 is 64+8+1+2+0 (bits6,3,1,0), but missing bit2. So (91 &79) is 64+8+2+1 =75. Which is not equal to79. So no.

digit3:79 → yes. Because 79 &79=79.

digit4:102 → 102 is 1100110 (bits6,5,2,1). So 102 &79 is 64 (bit6) +2 (bit1) → 66 <79. No.

digit5:109 → 109 in binary is 1101101. Which is bits6,5,3,2,0. So 109 &79 is 64 (bit6) +8 (bit3) +0 (bit2 not set?) → 64+8=72. Then 109's bit2 is set (4). Wait, 109 is 64+32=96 +8=104 +4=108 +1=109. So bits6 (64),5 (32),3 (8),2 (4),0 (1). So 109's mask includes bits6,5,3,2,0. 79's mask is 64,3,2,1,0. So the AND would be 64 (bit6), 3 (8?), wait no. Wait 109's mask is 1101101 (binary). 79 is 1001111. AND is 1001101 → which is 77. 77 !=79. So no.

digit6:125 → 1111101. AND with79 (1001111) → 1001101 →77. No.

digit7:7 → 0000111. AND with79 is 0000111 (7) → no.

digit8:127 → 127 &79=79 → yes.

digit9:111 → binary 1101111. AND with79 (1001111) → 1001111 →79 → yes.

So units digits can be 3,8,9.

So possible combinations for x_tens (0,3,7,8,9) and x_units (3,8,9). Let's count all possible pairs:

x_tens has 5 options, x_units has3 options → 5 *3=15, which matches the third example's output.

So the code works.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

First, read the input. The input is a two-digit string, possibly with leading zero.

n = input().strip()

n_tens_digit = int(n[0])

n_units_digit = int(n[1])

Then, precompute the digit_masks.

digit_masks = [
    63,    #0
    6,     #1
    91,    #2
    79,    #3
    102,   #4
    109,   #5
    125,   #6
    7,     #7
    127,   #8
    111    #9
]

n_tens_mask = digit_masks[n_tens_digit]

n_units_mask = digit_masks[n_units_digit]

Then, count the number of x in 0..99 where:

x_tens = x //10

x_units = x %10

mask_xt = digit_masks[x_tens]

mask_xu = digit_masks[x_units]

if (mask_xt & n_tens_mask) == n_tens_mask and (mask_xu & n_units_mask) == n_units_mask:

count +=1

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    digit_masks = [63,6,91,79,102,109,125,7,127,111]

    n = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    n1 = int(n[0])

    n2 = int(n[1])

    mask1 = digit_masks[n1]

    mask2 = digit_masks[n2]

    count =0

    for x in range(100):

        xt = x //10

        xu = x %10

        mxt = digit_masks[xt]

        mxu = digit_masks[xu]

        if (mxt & mask1) == mask1 and (mxu & mask2) == mask2:

            count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

```output

```

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    digit_masks = [63,6,91,79,102,109,125,7,127,111]

    n = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    n1 = int(n[0])

    n2 = int(n[1])

    mask1 = digit_masks[n1]

    mask2 = digit_masks[n2]

    count =0

    for x in range(100):

        xt = x //10

        xu = x %10

        mxt = digit_masks[xt]

        mxu = digit_masks[xu]

        if (mxt & mask1) == mask1 and (mxu & mask2) == mask2:

            count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
73
""",
            "output": \
"""\

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Third example: 15 possibilities.

This code seems correct.

In terms of performance: for 100 iterations, each with a few operations. Even for the maximum input, it's O(1) time. So no problem with the time constraints.

Memory: very minimal. So it's acceptable.

Thus, this should be the correct and optimal solution.

```python
digit_masks = [63, 6, 91, 79, 102, 109, 125, 7, 127, 111]
n = input().strip()
n1, n2 = int(n[0]), int(n[1])
mask1, mask2 = digit_masks[n1], digit_masks[n2]
count = 0

for x in range(100):
    xt, xu = x // 10, x % 10
    if (digit_masks[xt] & mask1) == mask1 and (digit_masks[xu] & mask2) == mask2:
        count += 1

print(count)
```
