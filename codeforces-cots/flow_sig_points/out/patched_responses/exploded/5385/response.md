Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest possible b such that when we compute a tor b, we get c. The tor operation here is a digit-wise addition modulo 3, with no carry-over. So each digit in the result is (a_digit + b_digit) mod 3. 

Hmm, the first thing I need to do is understand how to reverse this operation. Because given a and c, we need to find b. For each digit in c, we can compute the corresponding b digit by (c_digit - a_digit) mod 3. But since mod can be tricky, we have to make sure that we subtract correctly. Wait, maybe for each digit position, the value of c's digit is (a's digit + b's digit) mod 3. So solving for b's digit: b_digit = (c_digit - a_digit) mod 3. But wait, subtraction modulo 3: yes. So for each digit in the ternary representations of a and c (padded to the same length), we compute the corresponding digit of b as (c_digit - a_digit) mod 3. Then we convert that ternary number back to decimal. That makes sense. 

But the challenge is handling the digits properly when a and c have different numbers of digits. Because we need to pad the shorter one with leading zeros so they have the same length. Then process each digit pair. 

So the steps are:

1. Convert both a and c to their ternary representations, padding with leading zeros so they have the same length.
2. For each digit position, compute b's digit as (c_digit - a_digit) mod 3. But since mod can be negative, we need to ensure the result is positive. For example, if c_digit is 0 and a_digit is 2, then (0-2) is -2, mod 3 is 1 (since -2 +3 =1). So the correct digit is 1.
3. Once all digits are computed, convert the ternary digits of b into a decimal number. That's the minimal possible b because leading zeros in ternary don't contribute to the value, but when there are multiple possibilities, the smallest number would have leading zeros in the higher digits. Wait, but wait: for example, if a's ternary is 12 and c's is 21 (both two digits), then each digit is (2-1) mod 3 = 1 for the first digit, (1-2) mod3 = (1-2 is -1) mod3 is 2. So the b is 12 in ternary, which is 5. 

So the approach is correct. Therefore, the algorithm is:

- Convert a and c to ternary, ensuring they have the same number of digits by padding with leading zeros.
- For each digit pair (a_digit, c_digit), compute b_digit = (c_digit - a_digit) % 3. 
- Convert the resulting ternary digits back to decimal, which will be the minimal possible b.

So the main steps are converting a and c to ternary, padding them, then computing each digit of b.

Now, how to convert a decimal number to ternary? Let's think. For example, 14 in decimal is 112 in ternary. Let's confirm:

14 divided by 3 is 4, remainder 2.

4 divided by 3 is 1, remainder 1.

1 divided by 3 is 0, remainder 1. So digits are 1,1,2, which is 112 ternary (which is 1*9 + 1*3 + 2 = 14). So yes.

So the conversion function would take a decimal number and return a list of digits in ternary, least significant digit first (since when we divide and mod, we get the digits in reverse order). Wait, no. Wait, when we divide a number by 3, the remainder is the least significant digit. So for example, 14: 14 /3 is 4, remainder 2 (LSB). Then 4/3 is 1 rem 1, then 1/3 is 0 rem 1. So the digits are 2,1,1. But we need the digits from MSB to LSB. Wait no. Wait, the remainders are the digits in reverse order. Because the first remainder is the LSB. So in the example, the ternary digits are 1,1,2 (MSB to LSB). But the remainders are collected as 2,1,1, which is reversed.

So to get the correct order, when converting, we collect the remainders in the order of LSB first, then reverse the list to get MSB first.

For example, 14:

divmod(14,3) gives 4,2. Then 4,3 gives 1,1. Then 1,3 gives 0,1. So the digits collected are 2,1,1. Reverse to get 1,1,2. So the ternary digits are [1,1,2].

So the conversion function for a number to ternary is:

digits = []
n = number
if n is 0, digits is [0]
else:
    while n>0:
        digits.append(n%3)
        n = n//3
then reverse the digits.

Wait, no. Because in the first step, 14%3 is 2 (LSB), so digits becomes [2], n becomes 4. 4%3 is 1 (next digit), digits becomes [2,1], n becomes 1. 1%3 is 1, digits becomes [2,1,1], n becomes 0. Then reverse to get [1,1,2], which is the correct ternary digits (112).

Yes. So the conversion function for a number to ternary is correct.

So the steps for converting a number to ternary as a list of digits (from MSB to LSB):

def decimal_to_ternary(n):
    if n ==0:
        return [0]
    digits = []
    while n >0:
        digits.append(n %3)
        n = n //3
    digits.reverse()
    return digits

Wait, but when n is 0, the list is [0]. Otherwise, for example, 5 in decimal is 12 in ternary. Let's see:

5 divided by 3 is 1, remainder 2.

1 divided by 3 is 0, remainder 1.

digits collected as [2,1], then reversed to [1,2]. Which is correct.

So the function works.

Now, the same for c. Then, after converting a and c to their ternary digits, we need to pad them with leading zeros to the same length.

For example, if a is 14 (digits [1,1,2], length 3) and c is 34 (digits [1,0,2,1], length 4). Then we need to pad a's digits to 4 digits by adding a leading zero, making [0,1,1,2]. Then process each digit.

Once the digits are aligned, for each position i, compute b_digit[i] = (c_digit[i] - a_digit[i]) %3. Then collect all these digits to form b's ternary digits, which are then converted back to decimal.

So the plan is:

1. Convert a and c to their ternary digit lists (MSB first).
2. Find the maximum length between the two. Pad each with leading zeros to reach this length.
3. For each digit position, compute b's digit as (c_digit - a_digit) mod3.
4. Convert the resulting digits (MSB first) back to a decimal number. This is the minimal possible b.

Wait, why is this the minimal possible? Because when there are leading zeros in the ternary digits, they contribute nothing. So for example, if the computed digits for b are [0, 1, 2], then the actual value is 0*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0 = 5. But if there are leading zeros, the minimal possible is to have those zeros. Because any leading zeros would make the number smaller. For example, 012 in ternary is 5. But if you add a leading zero, it's still the same. Wait, leading zeros are not part of the number. Wait, the ternary digits list could have leading zeros, but when converting back to decimal, they don't affect the value.

Wait, for example, ternary digits [0, 1, 1, 2] would represent 0*3^3 +1*3^2 +1*3 +2 = 9 +3 +2=14. But the actual ternary number is 0112, which is the same as 112. So leading zeros can be removed. But the problem is that when we pad a and c with leading zeros to the same length, the digits for b could have leading zeros, but when converting back to decimal, those leading zeros don't contribute. So the resulting b is the minimal possible because any leading zeros in the ternary representation would make the decimal value smaller. Wait, no. Because leading zeros in a number's representation don't affect its value. For example, 0123 is the same as 123. So when the ternary digits of b have leading zeros, the decimal number is the same as if those zeros were not there. Wait, no. Wait, the way the digits are stored in the list is MSB first, so for example, [0, 1, 2] would be 0*3^2 +1*3^1 +2*3^0 = 5. Which is same as [1,2] (12 in ternary). So the leading zeros in the digit list do affect the value. Wait, no. Because the leading zero is part of the digit list. Wait, if you have [0,1,2] as the digits, that's 0*9 +1*3 +2*1 =5. But if the digits are [1,2], that's 1*3 +2=5. So leading zeros do affect the value. Wait, but in the problem statement, when a and c have different lengths, they are padded with leading zeros. So for example, a is 14 (ternary 112), c is 34 (ternary 1021). So after padding, a becomes 0112 (but wait, no: the example given in the problem is 14 (which is 112 in ternary) and 50 (1212). So 14 is 112, so when adding leading zeros to match the length of 4 digits (like 50 is 1212), then a becomes 0112. Then tor is done digit by digit. So the leading zeros are part of the digits. So when converting b's digits, which may have leading zeros, they are part of the number.

Wait, but when you convert the digits to a decimal, leading zeros in the digit list (MSB first) would contribute 0 to higher place values, but the remaining digits would contribute as per their positions. For example, if the digits are [0, 0, 1], then the decimal value is 0*3^2 +0*3 +1 =1, which is same as [1]. So leading zeros can be omitted. But in the process of creating the digit list for b, leading zeros would be part of the list. However, when converting back to decimal, leading zeros are irrelevant. So to get the minimal possible b, we need to compute the digits as per the problem's requirements, but when converting those digits to a decimal number, leading zeros can be ignored. Wait, no. Because the digits are part of the ternary number, including leading zeros. But in decimal, leading zeros in a number's representation don't exist. For example, the ternary number 0012 is 5, which is the same as 12 in ternary. So leading zeros in the ternary digits of b would make the decimal value smaller. Wait, no. For example, if the digits for b are [0, 0, 0], then the value is 0. If the digits are [0,0,1], the value is 1. So leading zeros are part of the digits, but when converting to decimal, they contribute to the value. Wait, but in the example where a is 5 (12 in ternary) and c is 5 (12 in ternary), then for each digit, (c_digit - a_digit) mod3 is (1-1 mod3=0, 2-2 mod3=0). So the digits for b are [0,0], which is 0 in decimal. So the output is 0, which matches the sample input 4.

So leading zeros in the digits of b are part of the number, but when converting to decimal, the leading zeros contribute to the value. But in that case, leading zeros would make the number larger, right? Wait, no. Wait, let's take an example. Suppose b's ternary digits are [0, 0, 1]. That's 0*3^2 +0*3 +1 =1. If the digits were [0,1], that's 0*3 +1 =1. So leading zeros in higher digits (like leading zeros to the left) do not affect the decimal value. Wait, no. Wait, if the digits are [0,1], the value is 0*3^1 +1*3^0 =1. If the digits are [0,0,1], the value is 0*3^2 +0*3^1 +1*3^0 =1. So the decimal value is the same. So leading zeros in the ternary digits (i.e., digits to the left of the most significant non-zero digit) do not affect the decimal value. So when converting the list of digits to decimal, leading zeros can be safely ignored. 

But in the problem statement, the digits are computed for each position after padding a and c to the same length. So, for example, if a is 5 (12 ternary) and c is 5 (12 ternary), then the digits for b are 00 in ternary, which is 0. But according to the problem's sample input 4, the output is 0, which is correct. So in that case, the leading zeros are part of the digits but when converted to decimal, they sum to zero.

Wait, no. Because the ternary digits for b would be 00. So each digit is 0. So 0*3^1 +0*3^0 =0. So yes, the correct value.

So in the conversion from the ternary digits to decimal, the leading zeros are considered as part of the digits. So even if the digits list is [0,0,0], the value is 0. But if the digits list is [0,1,0], the value is 0*9 +1*3 +0=3.

So in order to get the correct decimal value, the digits list must be processed as-is, including leading zeros. Wait, but leading zeros in the digits list (MSB first) are part of the number. For example, [0,1,0] is 0*3^2 +1*3^1 +0*3^0 =3. So the value is 3. So leading zeros in the digits list contribute to the value only if they are followed by non-zero digits.

Therefore, when building the digits list for b, leading zeros are part of the digits, but their presence may or may not contribute to the decimal value. However, the minimal possible b is achieved when the digits list has as few digits as possible. Wait, but in the problem statement, the digits for a and c are padded to the same length. So the digits list for b will have the same length as the padded a and c. Therefore, the digits list for b can have leading zeros. For example, in the first sample input, a is 14 (112 in ternary, length 3), c is 34 (1021 in ternary, length 4). So a's digits are padded to 4 digits as [0,1,1,2]. c's digits are [1,0,2,1]. Then for each position:

b_digits[0] = (1 - 0) mod3 =1 mod3=1

b_digits[1] = (0 -1) mod3= (-1) mod3=2

b_digits[2] = (2 -1) mod3=1 mod3=1

b_digits[3] = (1 -2) mod3= (-1) mod3=2

So the digits list for b is [1,2,1,2]. Wait, but in the sample input, the correct answer is 50. Let's see: 50 in decimal is 1212 in ternary. Let's check:

50 /3 is 16 rem 2

16/3 is 5 rem 1

5/3 is 1 rem 2

1/3 is 0 rem 1.

Digits collected as [2,1,2,1], reversed? Wait, wait, when converting 50 to ternary:

50 divided by 3 is 16, rem 2 (LSB)

16 divided by 3 is 5, rem 1

5 divided by 3 is 1, rem 2

1 divided by 3 is 0, rem 1.

So the digits list is [2,1,2,1], then reversed to get [1,2,1,2], which is 1*3^3 +2*3^2 +1*3 +2 = 27 + 18 +3 +2 =50. So the digits list for b is [1,2,1,2], which when converted is 50. So the approach works.

So the algorithm is correct.

Now, the steps to code this:

First, write a function to convert a decimal number to a list of ternary digits (MSB first, with leading zeros as needed).

Then, for a and c, generate their ternary digits, pad with leading zeros to the same length.

Then, for each digit position, compute (c_digit - a_digit) mod 3. This gives the ternary digits of b.

Then, convert this list of digits back to decimal.

Edge cases to consider:

- a=0 and c=0: then b is 0.

- a=0, c= some value. Then b is c, because 0 tor b = b. Because 0's digits are all zeros (after padding), so each digit of b is (c_digit -0) mod3 = c_digit mod3. But since c is given, the digits are correct.

Wait, if a is 0 and c is 5, then the digits of a are [0], digits of c are [12], but wait, no. Let's see. 5 in decimal is 12 in ternary. So a is 0 (digits [0]), c is 12 in ternary. Then after padding, a's digits become [0,0], c's digits [1,2]. Then for each digit:

0-0 mod3=0-0=0 mod3=0? No, wait, c_digit is first digit 1, a_digit is 0. So (1-0) mod3 is 1. Then (2-0) mod3 is 2. So digits of b are [1,2], which is 1*3 +2=5. So yes. So if a is zero, then b is c's value, but with each digit mod3. Wait, but c is given in decimal. So when converting c to ternary, the digits are correct. So the result would be c's digits mod3? Or not? Because when a is zero, the digits of a are all zeros, so b's digits are (c_digit -0) mod3, which is c_digit mod3. But the c_digits are derived from c's decimal value. So for example, if c is 5 (12 in ternary), then each digit is 1 and 2, which are mod3 1 and 2, so the digits for b are 1 and 2, which sum to 5. So yes, correct.

Another edge case: a=5 (12 in ternary), c=5 (12 in ternary). Then each digit of b is (1-1) mod3=0 and (2-2) mod3=0. So digits are 00, which is 0. Which matches sample input 4.

Another edge case: a=50 (1212 in ternary), c=34 (1021 in ternary). The sample input 2 has a=50 and c=34. The output is 14. Let's see:

Digits of a (50) are [1,2,1,2], c's digits (34) are [1,0,2,1]. Then for each position:

1-1 mod3=0

0-2 mod3= (0-2) =-2 mod3=1

2-1 mod3=1 mod3=1

1-2 mod3= -1 mod3=2.

So digits of b are [0,1,1,2], which is 0*3^3 +1*3^2 +1*3 +2 = 9+3+2=14. Correct.

So the algorithm works.

Now, the code steps:

Implement decimal_to_ternary(n) function.

But note that when n is 0, the function returns [0].

Then, pad the a and c ternary digits lists with leading zeros to the same length.

Then, for each digit pair, compute (c_digit - a_digit) %3, append to b_digits list.

Then convert the b_digits list back to decimal.

Implementing this in Python.

Now, the code:

First, the conversion functions.

But in Python, how to handle leading zeros?

For example, for a and c:

a_ter = decimal_to_ternary(a)
c_ter = decimal_to_ternary(c)

max_len = max(len(a_ter), len(c_ter))

pad a_ter with [0]*(max_len - len(a_ter)) at the beginning.

Similarly for c_ter.

For example, a_ter is [1,1,2], len 3. max_len is 4. Then pad with one zero: [0,1,1,2].

Once both are padded, process each digit.

Then, compute b_ter digits.

Then, convert b_ter to decimal.

To convert from ternary digits (MSB first) to decimal:

sum( digit * (3 ** i) for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(digits)) )

Wait, no. For example, digits [1,1,2], which is 1*3^2 +1*3^1 +2*3^0 =9 +3 +2=14.

If the digits are in a list [1,1,2], then the indices are 0,1,2 (MSB first). So 3^2, 3^1, 3^0.

So for each index i in 0..n-1, the value is digit[i] * 3^(n-1 -i).

Alternatively, reverse the list and multiply each digit by 3^i where i starts at 0.

For example, digits [1,1,2] reversed is [2,1,1]. Then 2*3^0 +1*3^1 +1*3^2 =2 +3 +9=14.

Yes.

So the code for converting ternary digits to decimal:

def ternary_to_decimal(digits):
    total =0
    power =0
    for digit in reversed(digits):
        total += digit * (3 ** power)
        power +=1
    return total

Yes.

Now, let's code this.

Putting it all together:

Read a and c from input.

Convert a and c to ternary digits.

Pad with leading zeros to same length.

For each digit pair, compute (c_digit - a_digit) mod3. Note that if the lists are of the same length, but if one was shorter, after padding, they are same.

Then, collect the b_digits.

Convert to decimal and output.

Now, handle the case where a and/or c is zero.

Test case 1: a=14 (112), c=34 (1021). After padding, a is 0112 (digits [0,1,1,2]), c is 1021 (digits [1,0,2,1]). Then:

digits of b are (1-0) mod3=1, (0-1) mod3=2, (2-1)=1, (1-2)= -1 mod3=2. So digits [1,2,1,2], which is 1*3^3 + 2*3^2 +1*3 +2=27+18+3+2=50.

Which matches the sample.

Now, code:

But note that when converting a number to ternary, the digits are stored in a list from MSB to LSB. So when padding, leading zeros are added to the front.

For example, a is 14 (112) as [1,1,2]. To pad to 4 digits, add one leading zero: [0,1,1,2].

So in code:

a_ter = decimal_to_ternary(a)
c_ter = decimal_to_ternary(c)

max_len = max(len(a_ter), len(c_ter))

a_ter_padded = [0]*(max_len - len(a_ter)) + a_ter
c_ter_padded = [0]*(max_len - len(c_ter)) + c_ter

Then, for each i in 0..max_len-1:

b_digit = (c_ter_padded[i] - a_ter_padded[i]) %3

Collect these into b_ter.

Then convert to decimal.

Edge case when a or c is zero:

If a=0, then a_ter is [0]. So when max_len is longer, a_ter_padded is [0,0,...0] (length max_len). So for each digit, c_ter_padded[i] -0 mod3. So the digits of b are same as c_ter_padded mod3. But since c_ter_padded is the padded version of c, which when converted to decimal gives c. So in this case, the answer is c. But only if a is zero. Wait no. For example, a is zero, c is 5 (12 in ternary). Then the digits of a are [0], c is [1,2] after padding. So a_ter_padded is [0,0]. c_ter_padded is [1,2]. Then for each digit:

0 and 1: 1-0=1 mod3=1.

0 and 2: 2-0=2 mod3=2.

So b_ter is [1,2], which is 5. So yes, correct.

But if c is 4, which is 11 in ternary. Then a_ter_padded is [0,0], c_ter_padded is [1,1]. Then b_ter is [1-0=1, 1-0=1], which is 11 in ternary (1*3 +1=4). So correct.

Another edge case: a=5, c=5. Then a_ter is [1,2], c_ter is [1,2]. After padding (same length), for each digit:

1-1=0 mod3, 2-2=0 mod3. So b_ter is [0,0], which is 0. Correct.

Now, code for decimal_to_ternary:

def decimal_to_ternary(n):
    if n ==0:
        return [0]
    digits = []
    while n >0:
        digits.append(n%3)
        n = n//3
    digits.reverse()
    return digits

Yes.

So the code steps:

Read a and c.

Convert to ternary.

Pad with leading zeros.

Compute b_ter digits.

Convert to decimal.

Sample 3's code will process a_ter as [1,0,0,...0] (18 zeros?), wait no: 3^18 is 387,420,489. So the ternary representation is 1 followed by 18 zeros. So a_ter is [1] followed by 18 zeros. So len 19.

c's ternary is ... Well, the code will process it correctly.

But regardless, the code should handle large numbers because the conversion is O(log n) steps.

The code seems correct.

Another sample:

Sample 4: input 5 5.

a_ter is [1,2], c_ter is [1,2]. After padding (same length), each digit subtracted gives 0 and 0. So b_ter is [0,0] → 0. Correct.

So the code works.

Thus, the code should be as written.

```python
a, c = map(int, input().split())

def decimal_to_ternary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % 3)
        n = n // 3
    digits.reverse()
    return digits

a_ter = decimal_to_ternary(a)
c_ter = decimal_to_ternary(c)

max_len = max(len(a_ter), len(c_ter))
a_padded = [0] * (max_len - len(a_ter)) + a_ter
c_padded = [0] * (max_len - len(c_ter)) + c_ter

b_ter = []
for a_digit, c_digit in zip(a_padded, c_padded):
    b_digit = (c_digit - a_digit) % 3
    b_ter.append(b_digit)

def ternary_to_decimal(digits):
    total = 0
    power = 0
    for d in reversed(digits):
        total += d * (3 ** power)
        power += 1
    return total

print(ternary_to_decimal(b_ter))
```
