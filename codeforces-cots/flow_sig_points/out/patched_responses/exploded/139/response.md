<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about removing elements from a sequence to maximize the number of positions where the element equals its index. So after removing some elements, the remaining elements are concatenated, and their indices are adjusted. For example, if we have elements [4, 2, 3, 1], removing the third element gives [4,2,1], which has indices 1,2,3. So the third element here is 1, which doesn't match. But if we didn't remove anything, the original array has 4 at index 1, 2 at index 2 (so that's a match), 3 at index 3 (another match), and 1 at index 4. Wait, but in the second example, the output is 2. Oh right, because the original array has a_2=2 and a_3=3. So two matches. The answer is 2. So no operations needed.

So the task is to find the maximum possible number of fixed points (a_i = i) after possibly removing some elements. The key is that after removal, the indices of the remaining elements are adjusted. For example, if elements before position k are kept, their indices remain as before. But elements after k are shifted left by how many elements were removed before them.

Hmm. How to model this?

Let's think: for each element a_j, when could it end up in a position i such that a_j = i in the final array. The final array is a subsequence of the original array, right? Because when you remove elements, the order of the remaining elements is preserved.

Wait, but the way you remove elements can be arbitrary. So the final array is a subsequence (elements in order, not necessarily contiguous) of the original array.

Wait, but when you remove elements one by one, each time you remove any element, the remaining elements form a new array. So the order is preserved. So the final array after some deletions is a subsequence of the original array.

So the problem reduces to selecting a subsequence of the original array, such that the number of positions i where the i-th element in the subsequence equals i is maximized.

So the core problem is: find a subsequence S of the original array A (elements in order) such that for each element s_k in S, s_k = k. The goal is to maximize the count of such elements.

Now, how do we model this?

Let's think for each element in the original array. Suppose the element is A[j] (original index j). If this element is part of the subsequence S, and in S it's at position k, then for it to contribute to the count, we need A[j] = k. But in the subsequence S, the positions are determined by their order. So the position k in S is the same as the number of elements in S up to and including this element.

So when building the subsequence S, each element added to S must have a value equal to the current length of S plus 1. Because when we add it as the next element in S, its position is k = len(S) + 1. So for example, the first element in S must be 1, the second must be 2, and so on.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because some elements in S could be skipped. For example, if the original array is [1,3], then the subsequence [1,3] would have positions 1 and 2, but 3 is not equal to 2. Alternatively, the subsequence [3] would have position 1. 3 is not equal to 1. So the maximum is 1 (the first element alone). Wait, but in this case, the maximum possible is 1. So the idea is that the subsequence must be such that each element in the subsequence is exactly equal to its position in the subsequence.

So the problem is equivalent to finding the longest possible sequence of elements in the original array, in order, such that each element s_k = k. Because each such element contributes 1 to the count, and the maximum possible is the length of the longest such sequence.

Wait, that's a key insight. Because each element in the sequence must satisfy s_1=1, s_2=2, s_3=3, etc. So the maximum count is the length of the longest possible such sequence. Because every element in this sequence contributes to the count, and any longer sequence would have a higher count.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible length of a subsequence S of A where each element s_k = k. Then the answer is this maximum length.

Wait, let's test this with the examples.

First example input:

7
2 1 4 2 5 3 7

The output is 3.

Looking for a subsequence where each element is 1,2,3,4,... as per their positions in the subsequence.

Possible sequences:

Looking for elements that can form such a sequence.

For example, the first element in the subsequence must be 1. But where is 1 in the array? The second element is 1. So if we pick the second element as the first element of S (position 1), then the next elements in S must be 2 in position 2, 3 in position 3, etc.

But wait, let's see:

Looking for elements in the array that can form a sequence where each s_k = k. Let's see:

Looking for s_1=1. The earliest occurrence of 1 is at index 2. So take that as the first element.

Then, we need s_2=2. After index 2, the next elements are 4,2,5,3,7. The earliest 2 here is at index 4 (original index 4, but after index 2). So take that as the second element. Now s_2=2.

Then, we need s_3=3. The next elements after index 4 are 5,3,7. The first 3 is at index 6. Take that as the third element.

Now, we need s_4=4. But after index 6, there's 7. So no. So the length here is 3. Which matches the sample output.

Alternatively, is there a longer sequence? Let's see another possible path.

Suppose we take index 1 (element 2) as part of the subsequence. But then s_1 would need to be 1, but 2 is not 1. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: take index 3 (element 4) as s_4. But to get to that, the previous elements in the subsequence would have to be 1,2,3. Let's see:

Is there a way to form a longer sequence? Like 1,2,3,4.

Wait, in the original array, after index 2 (element 1), we have 4 at index 3. Then, can we have a 2 after that?

Wait, for s_2=2, we need to have a 2 after the first element (which is 1). The first occurrence of 2 after index 2 is at index 4. Then, after that, looking for 3: the next occurrence is at index 6. Then, after that, looking for 4: but there's no 4 after index 6. So that gives us s_3=3 (position 3), so the sequence length is 3.

Alternatively, maybe a different order.

Alternatively, after taking s_1=1 (element at index 2), then s_2=2 (element at index4), then s_3=3 (element at index6), then s_4=7 (element at index7). But 7 is not 4. So that's no good.

Another approach: maybe some elements can be skipped. For example, maybe we can have a sequence where some numbers are skipped, but their positions are adjusted. Wait no, because the positions in the subsequence are consecutive. So the sequence must be 1,2,3,... in order. Because the k-th element in the subsequence must equal k.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that there exists a subsequence in the array where the first element is 1, the second is 2, ..., the k-th is k.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the k-th element in the subsequence must be k, but the order of the original array must be preserved.

So the solution is to find the maximum length of a sequence 1,2,3,...,k, in order, appearing as a subsequence in the array. The maximum such k is the answer.

Wait, but in the first example, the sample output is 3. So the maximum k is 3. Let's see: does the array have 1,2,3 in order? Yes. The elements at indices 2 (1), 4 (2), 6 (3). So the subsequence 1,2,3. Then the count is 3.

But then, in the second example, the array is [4,2,3,1]. The elements 2 and 3 are in positions 2 and 3, so the subsequence [2,3] gives a count of 2. But according to the problem statement, the answer is 2. So that's correct.

So the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum k where the array has elements 1,2,...,k in order as a subsequence. Then the answer is k.

Wait, but in the first example, after deleting some elements, the subsequence becomes [1,2,3], which gives k=3. So yes.

So the answer is the maximum possible k such that there exists a subsequence in the array A of elements 1,2,...,k in order.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where 1,2,...,k appear in order in the array. The answer is k.

But wait, is that always the case? Are there cases where not taking the entire 1..k sequence but leaving some elements in between could give a higher count?

No. Because the count is the number of elements in the subsequence where each element equals its position in the subsequence. So each element s_i in the subsequence must equal i. Therefore, the subsequence must be exactly 1,2,3,...,k in order. Because for each position i in the subsequence, the element must be i.

So the maximum possible count is the maximum k such that 1,2,...,k can be found as a subsequence in the original array. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the length of the longest such consecutive sequence starting from 1.

So the solution is to find the maximum k where the array contains a subsequence 1,2,...,k, and output k.

So how do we compute this k efficiently?

This is similar to the problem of finding the length of the longest consecutive increasing subsequence starting at 1, where each element is exactly the next integer. The approach here is similar to checking if 1 exists, then 2 after 1, then 3 after 2, etc.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize current = 1.

Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, if it's equal to current, then increment current.

The maximum current-1 (since current is incremented after finding the element) is the answer.

Wait, no. Wait, this is the standard approach for checking if a sequence contains 1,2,3,...k as a subsequence. For example, if you want to find the maximum k such that the elements 1..k appear in order, you can track the current number you're looking for. Start with 1. As you iterate through the array, whenever you find the current number, you increment current. The maximum current-1 is the answer.

For example:

In the first sample input: [2,1,4,2,5,3,7]

Iterate through the elements:

element 2: not current (1). current remains 1.

element 1: found current. current becomes 2.

element 4: not current (2).

element 2: found current. current becomes 3.

element5: not 3.

element3: found current. current becomes4.

element7: not 4.

So current is 4. The maximum k is 3 (current-1=3). Which matches the sample.

In the second example: [4,2,3,1]

Looking for 1:

elements 4: no. 2: no. 3: no. 1: found. current becomes 2. Then, look for 2. But after the 1, there are no elements. So current is 2. So current-1 is 1. But the sample output is 2. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait wait, in the second sample, the array is [4,2,3,1]. So when we iterate through the array:

element4: looking for 1. No.

element2: looking for 1. No.

element3: looking for 1. No.

element1: found 1. current becomes 2.

After that, there are no elements left. So the current is 2, which implies the maximum k is 1. But the sample output is 2.

Hmm, so this approach doesn't work. What's wrong here?

In the second example, the correct answer is 2. Because in the original array, the elements 2 and 3 are at positions 2 and 3. So the subsequence [2,3] (positions 2 and 3) would have s_1=2 (no), s_2=3 (no). Wait no. Wait, if the subsequence is [2,3], then their positions in the subsequence are 1 and 2. So s_1=2 (not equal to 1), s_2=3 (not equal to 2). So this contributes 0. But the sample output is 2. Oh wait, the sample's explanation says that in the second example, the original array has two elements that are equal to their original indices. So a_2=2 and a_3=3. So when you remove no elements, the count is 2. So the answer is 2.

But according to the approach above, the algorithm would output 1. Which contradicts the sample. So the previous approach is incorrect.

Ah, I see. The mistake here is that the approach of looking for the sequence 1,2,3,...k in order in the array gives k as the answer. But in the sample where the array is [4,2,3,1], there's a subsequence [2,3], but this doesn't contribute to the count because in the subsequence, their positions are 1 and 2. But 2 != 1 and 3 != 2. So how does the original array have two elements contributing?

Because in the original array, a_2=2 and a_3=3. So when no elements are removed, their indices are 2 and 3. So in the original array, those elements contribute to the count, which is 2. So the answer is 2, even though the 1 and 4 are present.

So the approach of finding the longest consecutive sequence 1,2,3...k is not sufficient. Because in some cases, elements in the array may already be in their original positions, but not part of such a consecutive sequence. For example, elements 2 and 3 in the second sample are in their original positions, but 1 is not present. So the answer is 2.

So the previous approach is wrong. So the problem is not equivalent to finding the maximum k where 1,2,3...k appear in order. There's a different approach needed.

So the original idea was incorrect. So we need to re-express the problem.

Let's think again.

Each element in the final subsequence (after deletions) must satisfy s_i = i. So each element in the subsequence must equal its position in the subsequence.

So the final subsequence is a sequence of elements s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, where s_1 =1, s_2=2, ..., s_k=k. So the problem is to find the maximum k possible, such that the array contains 1,2,...,k in order as a subsequence.

But the sample input 2 shows that this is not the case. Because the answer is 2, but according to this approach, the maximum k would be 1 (since 1 is present, but 2 is present after 1). Wait, in the array [4,2,3,1], the 1 is the last element. So in the original array, the 2 (element 2) is at position 2, but in the subsequence that includes 2 and 3, their positions would be 2 and 3. Wait, no. Let's think: the original array is [4,2,3,1]. Suppose we delete the first and fourth elements. The remaining elements are [2,3]. So their positions in the new array are 1 and 2. So s_1=2 (which is not 1), s_2=3 (not 2). So this gives zero. So the maximum comes from not deleting anything. So in the original array, a_2=2 and a_3=3. So their positions are 2 and 3. So those two elements contribute to the count, giving 2.

But according to the approach of finding the maximum consecutive sequence 1,2,3...k, the answer would be 1 (since 1 is present after 2 and 3). So the previous approach is not sufficient.

So the problem is not equivalent to finding the maximum k where 1,2,...,k are present in order. So what's the correct approach?

Hmm. The key is that each element in the final subsequence must be exactly equal to their position in the final array. So the elements can be any numbers, but in the final array, they must form a sequence 1,2,3,...,k where k is the length of the array.

But the way the elements are chosen (as a subsequence of the original array) allows for elements in the original array to be placed in positions in the subsequence where their value equals their new index.

So for example, in the second sample, the elements 2 and 3 are in positions 2 and 3 in the original array. So when you take them (without deleting anything), their positions are 2 and 3. So a_2=2 and a_3=3. So they contribute 2 to the count.

But according to the previous approach, which looks for the sequence 1,2,3,...k in order, the answer would be 2 only if the sequence 1,2 is present. But in the second sample, the 1 is at position 4 (original index 4). So 2 comes before 1 in the array, so the approach would not find 2 in the array after 1. So the maximum k would be 1. But the correct answer is 2. So the previous approach is incorrect.

So this suggests that the problem is not just about finding the longest consecutive sequence starting with 1, but also considering elements that are already in their original positions, even if they don't form a consecutive sequence.

So what's the correct way to model this?

Alternative approach:

Each element in the final array can contribute to the count if and only if in the final array, the element's value is equal to its position in the final array.

So for each possible element a_j in the original array, if we can position it at position i in the final array (i <= j's new position after deletions), then a_j must equal i. So how can we model this?

The idea is to find all elements a_j where a_j <= their possible position in the final array. For example, if we decide to include a_j in the final array, then in the final array, the position of a_j is i. Then a_j must equal i.

But how can we model the positions in the final array?

The final array is a subsequence of the original array. So for each element in the final array, their order is preserved. The position in the final array is determined by their order in the original array and which elements are included.

So for example, in the original array [4,2,3,1], if we include elements 2 (original index 2) and 3 (original index3), then their positions in the final array are 1 and 2. Because they are the first two elements in the final array. So a_j for element 2 is 2, which would be in position 1, which doesn't match. Element3 is 3 in position 2: also doesn't match. So this gives zero.

But in the original array, if we don't delete anything, the elements are in positions 1,2,3,4. So a_2=2 (matches position 2), a_3=3 (matches position3). So this gives count 2.

So how to model this.

The problem is to select a subset of elements, in order, such that for each element in the subset, its value equals its position in the subset. The maximum possible count is the maximum number of such elements.

This seems similar to finding a sequence S where S_i = i for all i in S. So each element in S is exactly its position in S.

So how can we model this?

Another way to look at this: For a given element a_j in the original array, if we include it in the final array, and in the final array, it is the k-th element, then a_j must equal k. So the question is: for which elements a_j can they be placed in the k-th position of the final array, where k = a_j, and the elements before j in the original array can form the first (k-1) elements.

But how can we track this?

Dynamic programming approach:

Let's consider the maximum possible count up to each element. Let dp[k] be the earliest position in the original array where we can form a subsequence of length k, such that the k-th element is exactly k.

Wait, but that's perhaps not feasible for large n. Since n can be up to 2e5, a O(n) or O(n log n) approach is needed.

Alternative idea: For each possible k, can we find a way to have elements in the array that can be arranged in a way that the first element is 1, the second is 2, ..., the k-th is k. But this is the same as the initial approach, which failed for the second sample.

But wait, in the second sample, the elements 2 and 3 are in their original positions, which are positions 2 and 3. So in the final array, if we don't delete anything, their positions are 2 and 3. So their values are 2 and 3. So they contribute to the count.

But according to the initial approach, the code would look for the sequence 1,2. But since 1 is at position 4 in the array, which comes after 2 and 3, the code would not find 1, then 2. So the maximum k would be 1. But the correct answer is 2.

So the initial approach is incorrect because it's looking for a consecutive sequence starting at 1, but the actual answer can have elements that are not part of such a sequence but are in their original positions.

So this suggests that the problem is more complex. How can we model the selection of elements that may not form a consecutive sequence starting at 1, but individually satisfy s_i = i in the final array?

Alternative approach: For each element a_j in the array, if a_j is at position i in the final array, then a_j must equal i. So for a_j to contribute to the count, the final array must have a_j at position i where i = a_j. So for a_j to be part of the count, we need to have at least a_j elements in the final array, and a_j is the i-th element where i = a_j.

But how can we track which elements can be part of such a sequence?

Another idea: For each element a_j, the maximum possible contribution it can have is 1 if there exists a way to arrange the elements such that it is placed at position a_j in the final array. But how to arrange this.

The problem is similar to placing elements in their required positions. For example, element a_j can be placed at position i = a_j in the final array. So for that to happen, the final array must have exactly a_j elements, and a_j is the i-th element. But this is not possible if a_j is larger than the possible length of the array.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to find all elements that have a_j <= their original index, and for each such a_j, check if there are at least a_j-1 elements before it with a_i <= a_j-1 and in positions that allow them to form a subsequence where each is placed at their respective a_i positions.

But this seems complicated.

Alternative plan:

We can model this as follows: For the final array to have k elements, the k-th element must be exactly k, and the first k-1 elements must form a valid sequence of length k-1.

So this is similar to building the sequence incrementally. To have a sequence of length k, the k-th element in the sequence must be k, and the first k-1 elements must form a valid sequence of length k-1.

Thus, this resembles the problem of finding the longest possible sequence where each element in position i is exactly i.

So the approach would be:

Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the earliest position in the original array where a sequence of length i can be formed, with the i-th element being i.

Then, for each element in the original array, we check if it can extend some sequence.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, for each element a_j, if a_j is a possible candidate to be in the final array at position k = a_j, then we need to ensure that there are enough elements before a_j to form the first k-1 elements.

But how?

Alternatively, for each element a_j, the maximum possible contribution it can make is 1 (if it can be placed at position a_j in the final array). So for each a_j, we can check if it's possible to have a subsequence of a_j elements where the first a_j-1 elements form a valid sequence and the a_j-th element is a_j.

So for example, if a_j is 3, then we need to have a subsequence of length 3, where the third element is a_j, and the first two elements are 1 and 2 in order.

But this is similar to the initial approach.

But how does this handle cases where elements are in their original positions?

For example, in the second sample, the element 2 is at position 2. To be in the final array's position 2, we need to have a_j=2 and that there are two elements in the final array. Also, the first element must be 1.

But in the original array, there is no 1 before the 2. However, the sample answer includes the 2 in position 2 of the original array, which is part of the final array (no deletions). So the final array's position 2 is 2. So the first element is 4 (position 1 of the original array) but in the final array, it's at position 1, which equals 4. So it doesn't contribute. But the 2 is at position 2 in the final array, which equals 2, so it contributes. The 3 is at position 3 in the final array, which equals 3. So the count is 2. So this is allowed even though the first element in the final array is 4, which doesn't contribute.

Wait, but in the final array, the first element is 4 (position 1 in the final array), which doesn't contribute. The second element is 2 (position 2 in the final array), which contributes. The third element is 3 (position 3 in the final array), which contributes. The fourth element is 1 (position4), which doesn't contribute. So the count is 2. So the elements 2 and 3 are contributing.

But according to the initial approach, since there's no 1 before the 2, the 2 can't be part of a sequence 1,2. So the initial approach would output 1. But the correct answer is 2.

So this suggests that the initial approach is not sufficient. So the problem is not about finding a consecutive sequence 1,2,3,...,k, but rather individual elements that are in their final positions.

So how do we model this?

Alternative idea: For each element a_j in the array, if a_j <= j (the original index), then it's possible that after removing some elements before a_j, a_j can be placed in position a_j in the final array. For example, if a_j is 2, and it's at original index 5. To have it in position 2 of the final array, there must be exactly one element before it in the final array, which is placed in position 1. But that element must be 1. But if there's no 1 before a_j, then this is not possible.

Wait, but this is getting complicated.

Another approach: For each element a_j in the array, if a_j is k, then to be placed at position k in the final array, there must be at least k-1 elements before it in the array (possibly after deletions) that form a sequence of length k-1, where each element in position i (of the final array) is i.

But this seems like a recursive problem.

But how can we model this efficiently?

Perhaps, for each possible k, track the earliest position where the k-th element can be placed. This is similar to the standard problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence in O(n log n) time.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by that approach:

We can maintain an array 'best', where best[k] is the smallest index j where a_j can be the k-th element in the final array (i.e., a_j = k and there exists a subsequence of the first j elements that includes a subsequence of length k-1 ending before j).

For example, to compute best[k], we look for elements a_j where a_j =k and there exists a subsequence of length k-1 ending before j.

But how can we compute this?

Let's initialize best[0] = 0. Then for each element a_j in the array:

If a_j is k, then we can check if best[k-1] < j. If so, then best[k] can be updated to min(best[k], j).

This is similar to the approach for the longest increasing subsequence problem. Let's see.

For example, in the second sample:

Original array is [4,2,3,1].

Processing each element:

element 4 (a_j=4):

We check k=4. best[3] is initially infinity (assuming we initialize best as all infinity except best[0]=0). So no update.

element 2 (a_j=2):

Check k=2. best[1] is infinity (since we haven't found any element for k=1 yet). So no update.

element3 (a_j=3):

Check k=3. best[2] is still infinity. No update.

element1 (a_j=1):

Check k=1. best[0] =0 <4. So best[1] is updated to 4 (the index of this element? Or the current j, which is 4 (if indices are 1-based). Assuming indices are 1-based, then j=4 for this element.

Now, best[1] =4.

So after processing all elements, the best array would have best[1] =4. But the answer is 2. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. Because in the second sample, the elements 2 and 3 are at indices 2 and 3. So for k=2, we need best[1] <2 and a_j=2. So when processing j=2 (a_j=2), check if best[1] <2. best[1] is initially infinity, so no. But after processing the first element (a_j=4), no changes. Then when processing j=2 (a_j=2), k=2. best[1] is infinity, so no. Then when processing j=3 (a_j=3), k=3. best[2] is infinity, so no. Then when processing j=4 (a_j=1), best[1] becomes 4.

So after processing all elements, the maximum k for which best[k] is not infinity is 1. But the answer is 2. So this approach is also not working.

So what's wrong here?

Because in the second sample, the elements 2 and 3 are in their original positions. So their indices in the original array are 2 and 3. So when we don't delete any elements, the final array has elements 4,2,3,1. The indices in the final array are 1,2,3,4. So a_2=2 (contribution), a_3=3 (contribution), others no. So the count is 2.

But according to this approach, the best array would not capture this scenario. Because the elements 2 and 3 are not part of a sequence where they are the k-th element in a sequence formed by the previous elements.

So this approach captures sequences where each element is part of a chain that builds up the sequence 1,2,3,...k. But the sample shows that elements can contribute even if they are not part of such a sequence.

So this suggests that the problem is not about building a sequence where each element builds on the previous ones. But how can we model this?

Alternative idea: For each element a_j, if a_j <= j, then it can potentially be part of the final array. Because after deleting some elements before j, j's new position could be a_j. So the number of elements retained before j is a_j -1.

So for example, if j=3 and a_j=2, then in the final array, there must be 1 element before j (since a_j=2), so j's position is 2. But how to ensure that those elements are properly arranged.

But the key is, for each a_j, if there are enough elements before it (exactly a_j-1) that can be retained to form the first a_j-1 positions.

But this seems complex.

Alternatively, for each element a_j, the maximum contribution it can make is 1, provided that in the final array, it is placed at position a_j, and there are a_j-1 elements before it. The elements before it can be any elements, but their positions in the final array must be such that they are placed before a_j.

But how to model this.

Let's think of it as for each a_j, the position in the final array is i. Then, i = a_j. So the number of elements in the final array up to and including a_j is i = a_j. So the number of elements after a_j in the final array can be arbitrary, but the elements before a_j must be a_j-1 in number.

But the order is preserved.

So for a_j to be part of the final array at position i = a_j, there must be at least a_j-1 elements before it in the original array that are selected and form the first a_j-1 positions.

But these elements can be any elements, but each of them must be placed in their respective positions (i.e., for each element selected before a_j, if it's placed at position k, then its value must be k).

But this is again recursive.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: the maximum possible count is the maximum number of elements a_j in the array such that a_j <= their original index j, and there are at least a_j-1 elements before j (in the original array) that can form a sequence of a_j-1 elements each satisfying their own a_i <= their original index and arranged such that their final positions are 1,2,...,a_j-1.

But this is getting very abstract.

Alternatively, for each element a_j, if a_j is k, then there must be k-1 elements before j in the array that can form a sequence of length k-1, each element in the sequence contributing to their own count. But how can we track this?

Alternatively, let's think of each possible k. We can collect all elements in the array where a_j =k. For each such element j, we can see if there are at least k-1 elements before j with a_i <=k-1. But this is not sufficient, as they need to form a sequence of length k-1.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming.

Let's consider dp[k] as the minimal index j where a_j is part of a sequence that has exactly k elements, each at their respective positions. Then, for each element a_j in the array, if a_j =k, then we can check if dp[k-1] < j. If so, then we can set dp[k] = min(dp[k], j).

This is similar to the standard approach for the longest increasing subsequence problem, where each element builds upon the previous elements.

But how does this work for the second sample?

Let's walk through the second sample with this approach.

Sample 2:

n=4

array = [4,2,3,1]

Process each element in order.

Initialize dp[0] =0, and dp[1...] = infinity.

element 4 (a_j=4):

k=4. We check if dp[3] <1 (index j=1). dp[3] is infinity, so no.

element 2 (a_j=2):

k=2. Check dp[1] <2. dp[1] is infinity, so no.

element3 (a_j=3):

k=3. Check dp[2] <3. dp[2] is infinity, so no.

element1 (a_j=1):

k=1. Check dp[0] <4 (j=4). Yes. So dp[1] is min(inf, 4) →4.

Now, the dp array after processing all elements is:

dp[0] =0, dp[1]=4, others are infinity.

So the maximum k is 1. But the correct answer is 2.

So this approach also fails for this case.

Hmm. So this approach doesn't capture the elements that are in their original positions but not part of the 1,2...k sequence.

So what's the crux of the problem?

The problem is that elements can contribute to the count even if they are not part of a consecutive sequence starting from 1. For example, in the second sample, 2 and 3 are in positions 2 and 3 of the original array, which are their correct positions in the final array even if there's no 1 before them.

But according to the problem statement, the final array can have elements that are not part of such a sequence.

Wait, but how can the elements 2 and 3 in the second sample be part of the count? Because in the final array (the original array), their positions are 2 and 3, and their values are 2 and 3. So they each contribute 1 to the count. So the answer is 2.

But according to the initial approach, the code would not count these elements unless they are part of a sequence starting with 1.

So the problem is not to find a consecutive sequence 1,2,3..., but to count all elements in the final array where a_i = i in the final array.

So the final array can have elements in any order (as long as it's a subsequence of the original array), and the count is the number of elements where their value equals their position in the final array.

Thus, the problem is to select a subsequence S of the original array, such that the number of elements s_i in S where s_i = i is maximized.

So each element in S contributes 1 if s_i =i, and 0 otherwise. We need to maximize the sum.

This is the same as choosing a subsequence S, and for each element in S, if the element's value is equal to its position in S, it contributes 1.

So how can we model this optimally?

Dynamic programming approach:

Let's think in terms of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum number of fixed points (elements satisfying s_j =j) in a subsequence ending at position i of the original array.

But this may not be efficient enough.

Alternatively, for each position i in the array, we can consider whether including a_i in the final subsequence contributes to the count. If we include a_i, then in the final subsequence, its position is k (the length of the subsequence up to and including a_i). So to contribute, we must have a_i =k.

So, the problem becomes finding a subsequence S where the elements are ordered, and each element s_j in S must satisfy s_j = j (the position in S).

So the elements must form a sequence 1,2,3,...k, but not necessarily consecutive. But each element must be exactly at its position in S.

Wait, no. The sequence S is ordered, and the positions in S are 1-based. For example, if S has elements [2,3], then their positions are 1 and 2. So 2 !=1, 3 !=2. So the count is zero. But if S is [2], the position is 1, but 2 !=1. So count is zero.

But in the second sample, the subsequence is the entire array, which has elements 4,2,3,1. The positions in S are 1,2,3,4. The elements are 4 (no), 2 (yes), 3 (yes), 1 (no). So count is 2.

So the elements contributing are at positions 2 and 3 of S. So their values are 2 and 3, which equal their positions in S.

But how to model this.

Wait, the key is that each element in S contributes 1 if and only if its value equals its position in S. So S can have elements at various positions, and the sum is the count of such elements.

So the problem is to select a subsequence S of the original array, where for as many elements as possible, their position in S equals their value.

So the challenge is to find a way to select such a subsequence that maximizes the count.

Dynamic programming approach:

We can model the problem using a dynamic programming array where dp[k] represents the minimal index j in the original array where a subsequence of length k can be formed such that exactly k elements contribute to the count (i.e., s_1=1, s_2=2, ..., s_k=k). But this is similar to the initial approach and fails for the second sample.

Alternatively, we can track for each possible k, the minimal index j where a subsequence ending at j can contribute to the count with s_j =k, and there are exactly k-1 elements before j that contribute to their positions.

But this seems complex.

Alternative idea: For each element a_j, if a_j is k, then to have this element contribute to the count, there must be exactly k-1 elements before j that form a subsequence S where their positions in S are 1, 2, ..., k-1, and their values are 1, 2, ..., k-1, respectively. So the maximum count up to j is k.

So the problem becomes similar to the initial approach. But this would give the maximum count as the maximum k for which there exists a subsequence 1,2,..k. But this doesn't capture cases where elements are not part of such a sequence but contribute to the count.

So how to reconcile this?

The second sample's answer is 2, which comes from two elements that are part of the original array's positions 2 and 3, but not part of a sequence 1,2. So the initial approach, which requires the sequence to start with 1, would miss these.

So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum between the initial approach's result and the maximum number of elements in the original array that satisfy a_j =j (i.e., the original count).

But in the second sample, the original count is 2. So the answer is 2. The initial approach's result is 1. So the maximum between the two is 2.

In the first sample, the original count is 0, but the initial approach gives 3. So the maximum is 3.

In the second sample, the initial approach's result is 1, but the original count is 2. So the answer is 2.

So this suggests that the correct answer is the maximum between the initial approach's result and the original count.

But how?

Wait, in the first sample, the original array is [2,1,4,2,5,3,7]. The original count is the number of elements where a_i =i:

Check each element:

a_1=2 !=1.

a_2=1 !=2.

a_3=4 !=3.

a_4=2 !=4.

a_5=5=5 → count +=1.

a_6=3 !=6.

a_7=7=7 → count +=1.

So the original count is 2. But the sample's answer is 3. So the maximum is 3, which is higher than the original count. So this approach would not work.

So this suggests that the maximum is not necessarily the maximum between the original count and the initial approach's result.

Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the optimal answer is the maximum between the original count and the maximum k from the initial approach.

But in the first sample, the original count is 2, and the initial approach's result is 3. So the answer is 3.

In the second sample, the original count is 2, initial approach's result is 1. So answer is 2.

But how do we compute the original count?

The original count is the number of elements in the original array where a_i =i.

So the idea is that sometimes, the optimal answer is to keep some elements that are in their original positions, even if they don't form a sequence starting with 1.

But how can we model this?

Perhaps the answer is the maximum between the initial approach's result and the original count.

But in the first sample, the original count is 2, and the initial approach's result is 3. So the answer is 3.

In the second sample, the original count is 2, initial approach's result is 1. So answer is 2.

But why would the first sample's answer be 3, which is higher than the original count? Because by removing elements, we can form a longer sequence of consecutive 1,2,3. So the initial approach's result is better.

Thus, the correct answer is the maximum between the initial approach's result and the original count.

But how to prove this?

Suppose that the optimal answer is either the maximum k from the initial approach or the original count. Because the initial approach gives the maximum possible k where we can form a sequence 1,2,...,k, which contributes k to the count. Alternatively, there may be elements in the original array that are already in their correct positions, and their count is higher than k.

But how to verify this.

In the first sample, the original count is 2 (elements 5 and7). But the initial approach's result is 3 (elements 1,2,3). So the answer is 3.

In the second sample, the original count is 2 (elements 2 and3), which is higher than the initial approach's result of 1. So the answer is 2.

Thus, the answer is the maximum between the initial approach's result and the original count.

So the solution is to compute two values:

1. The maximum k where there exists a subsequence 1,2,...,k.

2. The number of elements a_i =i in the original array.

The answer is the maximum of these two values.

But how can this be true?

Let's take another example.

Example:

n=3

array = [1, 3, 2]

Original count: 1 (a_1=1).

Initial approach's result: 2 (sequence 1,3 is not possible, but wait:

In the initial approach, current starts at 1. element1 is 1: current becomes 2. Then look for 2 in the remaining elements. The array has elements 3,2. Element3 is not 2. Element2 is 2. So current becomes 3. So initial approach's result is 2.

So the answer would be max(2,1)=2.

But in the original array, the count is 1. By selecting the subsequence [1,2], the count would be 1 (element1=1, element2=2. So positions are 1 and 2. So contributes 2. So the answer is 2.

Yes.

Another example:

n=4

array = [2, 1, 2, 3]

Original count: a_3=3 (third element is 3, a_4=3 no. So count is 1.

Initial approach's result: current=1. Looking for 1.

Elements 2,1. At index 2, a_j=1. current becomes 2. Then look for 2. elements after 2 are 2,3. The first 2 is at index3. current becomes3. look for3 after index3. element3. current becomes4. So initial approach's result is3. So answer is max(3,1)=3.

But what is the actual maximum count?

The subsequence [1,2,3] (indices 2,3,4) in the original array. Positions in the subsequence are 1,2,3. So elements are 1,2,3: each contributes 1. So count is3. Which matches the initial approach's result.

So the approach seems to work.

Another example where the original count is higher than the initial approach's result:

n=5

array = [1,3,3,4,5].

Original count: a_1=1, a_4=4, a_5=5. So count is3.

Initial approach's result: current=1. Element1=1, current becomes2. Look for2. No 2 in the array. So result is1. So the answer is max(3,1)=3.

Yes.

So the solution is to compute both the initial approach's result (maximum k where 1,2,...,k appear in order) and the original count (number of elements where a_i =i), and take the maximum of the two.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the original count: iterate through the array, count how many elements have a_i ==i.

2. Compute the maximum k using the initial approach: iterate through the array, track the current expected value, increment when found.

3. The answer is the maximum between the original count and the maximum k.

But wait, in the second sample, the initial approach's result is1 (because we find 1 at index4), but the original count is2. So the answer is2.

Yes.

But how do we compute the initial approach's result?

The initial approach's code is:

current =1

for each element in array:

    if element == current:

        current +=1

max_k = current -1

But in the second sample, this code gives current=2 (after finding 1 at index4), so max_k=1. But the answer is 2.

But according to this code, the maximum k is1, but the original count is2, so the maximum is2.

Thus, the code would output the correct answer by taking the maximum between the two.

So the code would:

- Compute the initial approach's max_k (1 in the second sample).

- Compute original_count (2 in the second sample).

- Output the maximum of the two.

So this approach works.

So the solution is to compute both values and output the maximum.

So in code, the steps are:

Read n and array.

Compute original_count: sum(1 for i in range(n) if a[i] == i+1)

Compute max_k: iterate through the array, and track current (starting at1). For each element, if it equals current, increment current. The max_k is current-1.

Output the maximum between original_count and max_k.

Let's test this with the samples.

First sample:

Original array: [2,1,4,2,5,3,7]

original_count: elements at indices (0-based) 4 (5th element) is5 → yes. 6th element is7 →7 ==7 (index6+1=7). So count is2.

max_k computed via the code is3 (current starts at1, finds1 at index1 (element1), current becomes2. Finds2 at index3, current becomes3. Finds3 at index5, current becomes4. So max_k is3.

max(2,3) →3. Correct.

Second sample:

array [4,2,3,1] → indices are 0-based.

original_count: check each element:

a[0] =4 → 0+1=1 → no.

a[1] =2 →1+1=2 → yes.

a[2] =3 →2+1=3 → yes.

a[3] =1 →3+1=4 → no.

count is2.

max_k: current starts at1. Iterate elements:

element4: no.

element2: no.

element3: no.

element1: equals current (1). current becomes2.

max_k is1.

max(2,1) →2. Correct.

Another example where the original_count is higher:

array [1,3,3,4,5].

original_count: 1 (index0),4 (index3),5 (index4) → count3.

max_k: current starts at1. Find1, current becomes2. Look for2 → no. So max_k is1. Max(3,1) →3.

Another example where max_k is higher:

array [1,2,3]. original_count is3. max_k is3. So answer is3.

Thus, this approach works.

So the code is as follows:

Read n.

Read the array.

Compute original_count by checking each a[i] == i+1 (since Python uses 0-based indices).

Compute max_k by iterating through the array and tracking current.

Then output the maximum of the two.

This is efficient and runs in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

Thus, the code would be:

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

original_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if a[i] == i + 1)

current = 1
max_k = 0
for num in a:
    if num == current:
        current += 1
max_k = current - 1

print(max(original_count, max_k))

This should handle all cases correctly.

Testing the second sample:

Input:

4

4 2 3 1

original_count is 2 (elements 2 and3).

max_k is1.

Output is 2.

First sample:

7

2 1 4 2 5 3 7

original_count is 2 (elements5 and7).

max_k is3. Max is3.

So the code works.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

original_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if a[i] == i + 1)

current = 1
for num in a:
    if num == current:
        current += 1

max_k = current - 1
print(max(original_count, max_k))
```
