<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.

So, the problem is about a tree where each node is colored black or white. Anton wants to make all nodes the same color using the minimum number of paint operations. The paint(v) operation changes the color of all nodes u such that every node along the path from v to u is the same color. So when you paint a node v, it affects all nodes in regions where the path to v is monochromatic.

The goal is to find the minimal number of such operations required to turn the entire tree into a single color, either all black or all white.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, considering that each operation can flip certain regions. But the key here is to model the optimal sequence of operations. Since the tree is connected, the order of operations might matter, but perhaps there's a way to model this as layers of regions that need to be flipped.

An example: if all nodes are already the same color, the answer is 0. That's the second sample input.

In the first sample, after painting 3 and 6, the entire tree becomes black. Let's see why. Painting 3 changes some regions, and then painting 6 affects others. So how do these operations combine?

I need to find a way to model the regions that can be affected by each operation and how to cover the entire tree with the minimal number of such operations.

Let me think about the structure of the tree. Each paint operation affects nodes that form a connected region (since the tree is connected). Because the condition is that all nodes along the path from v to u are the same color. So when you perform paint(v), all u in the maximal monochromatic region containing v (with the current color) are flipped.

Wait, but when you paint a node v, you look at all nodes u where the path from v to u is all the same color as the current color of v. Then, all those nodes get flipped. So after the flip, those nodes' color changes, which might affect the regions for subsequent operations.

But perhaps the optimal approach is to perform operations in a way that each subsequent operation affects a new region that can be optimally covered. But how?

Another angle: Let's consider that each operation can target a certain area. The problem is similar to covering the tree with such regions, where each region is a set of nodes that can be flipped with a single paint operation. But since after flipping, the regions change, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding certain patterns in the tree that dictate where operations must be applied.

Let me consider the case where all nodes are already the same color. Then the answer is zero. So we can first check if the entire tree is monochromatic and return zero in that case.

If not, then we have to find the minimal steps for both possible target colors (all black or all white) and choose the minimum of the two.

Wait, but maybe one target color requires fewer operations than the other. So the approach is to compute for both target colors (0 and 1) the minimal steps required, then take the minimum of those two.

So first, check if all nodes are the same. If so, return 0. Else, compute for target 0 and target 1, the minimal steps, and take the minimum.

But how to compute for each target color?

Let's pick a target color, say target T. We need to find the minimal number of paint operations to turn all nodes into T. Let's think of the process as flipping certain regions in a way that, after all operations, all nodes are T.

Each paint operation flips a connected region (the maximal monochromatic region containing v in the current color). But after each paint, the color of the nodes in that region changes, which affects future operations.

This seems like a dynamic problem, but perhaps there's a way to model it as a graph of necessary operations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a structure where the required operations are determined by the structure of the current color arrangement.

Another idea: the paint operations can be thought of in reverse. Suppose we start from the target state (all T) and reverse the operations to reach the initial state. Each reversed operation would also flip a region (since flipping the same region again would return it to the original state). But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a set of nodes such that their regions cover all nodes that need to be flipped. For example, if the target is all black, then any white regions need to be flipped. But each flip can affect certain regions, and overlapping regions might be optimized.

Wait, let's model the problem for a target color T. Let's say that the initial colors are C_1, C_2, ..., C_n. For the target T, all nodes must be T. So nodes that are already T don't need to be changed (unless their color is flipped during some operation). But nodes that are not T need to be flipped an odd number of times, and those that are T need to be flipped an even number (possibly zero) of times.

But each operation affects a certain region, which is determined by the current colors. However, since each operation changes the colors, the regions for subsequent operations depend on prior operations. This interdependency complicates the problem.

But perhaps there's a way to model this problem by considering the tree's structure and the color changes required. Let's think of the tree as a collection of monochromatic regions. For each such region of color different from T, we need to flip it. But flipping a region may split it into different regions, which may require more operations. Wait, but each flip affects the region in the current color. So when you flip a region, it's possible that adjacent regions (of the same color) get merged or split.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to paint the deepest possible nodes first. For example, in the first sample input, painting node 3 and then 6. Painting 3 first flips a large region, then painting 6 flips a smaller region. But how to model this?

Another approach is to model the problem as layers. Let's consider the tree as a hierarchy, and each operation must be applied in a certain order. For example, if there's a node in the subtree that needs to be flipped, perhaps flipping the parent first would allow the child to be flipped with fewer operations.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of the problem in terms of the required regions. Each time we perform a paint operation, we flip all nodes in the maximal monochromatic region containing the painted node. So each operation is applied to a connected region of the same color. After flipping, that region's color changes, which may affect adjacent regions.

But how to model the minimal steps? It's similar to graph covering, but the regions are dynamic based on previous operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached greedily. For each target color T, we can find the minimal number of operations by considering the required regions that need to be flipped. For example, in the initial tree, find all the maximal connected regions of color different from T. Then, each such region must be flipped exactly once. But is this correct?

Wait, no. Because when you flip a region, it may merge with adjacent regions of the same color (after flipping). For example, consider two adjacent regions of color C. After flipping one, their color becomes 1-C, but if they are adjacent, they form a single region. So flipping one region might affect the required operations for adjacent regions.

But perhaps the minimal number of operations required for target T is equal to the number of "clusters" of nodes that need to be flipped. Let's think: each cluster is a connected component of nodes that are not T. Then, each cluster can be flipped with one operation. But that's only possible if each cluster is a connected monochromatic region. Wait, but the initial clusters (nodes that need to be flipped) may be connected but have varying colors. Wait no, because the initial clusters (if target is T) would be the regions of color (1-T). So those regions are already connected and monochromatic. Because the initial tree has monochromatic regions (since the color is 1-T, and the tree is connected via edges). So for example, if the target is T, then all regions of color (1-T) are connected (since the tree is connected) and form a single connected component. Wait no, the tree is connected, but the colors may split it into multiple regions.

Wait, no. The tree's connectivity doesn't imply that the same-color regions are connected. For example, if the tree is a chain of nodes with colors alternating 0 and 1. Then the regions of 0 are disconnected. But the tree as a whole is connected. So the initial color regions can be multiple disconnected regions even though the tree is connected.

Wait, but in the tree, the color regions are connected if they are the same color. Because any two nodes in the same color region that are adjacent in the tree would form part of the same region. But if the color alternates along a path, then those regions are split. So the tree's color regions can be multiple connected regions, each of the same color, but separated by nodes of the opposite color.

So for a target T, the number of connected components of color (1-T) in the initial tree may determine the number of operations required. But how?

Wait, each paint operation can flip a connected region of color (current color). So for example, if the current color is (1-T) in a region, painting a node in that region would flip that entire connected region. So after flipping, that region becomes T. So for target T, each connected region of (1-T) in the initial tree must be flipped once. So the minimal number of operations for target T is equal to the number of connected components of (1-T) in the initial tree.

But wait, no. Because when you flip a region, adjacent regions of (1-T) (which was part of the original (1-T) components) might now become (T) after flipping. But wait, no. Let's think: suppose there are two adjacent regions of (1-T). Let's say the first region is flipped. It becomes T. The second region is still (1-T). But since they were adjacent in the tree, after flipping the first, the second is still (1-T). So the initial count of (1-T) regions is the number of operations required.

Wait, but perhaps not. For example, consider a tree where the root is 0, and all children are 0, but their children are 1. Suppose the target is 1. Then the initial regions of 0 (the root and its children) form a connected component. If we paint the root, that entire region flips to 1, but the children (originally 0) are now 1, but their children (originally 1) would now be part of regions of 0? Wait, no. Let's take a concrete example.

Example: A root node (0) connected to two children (0). Each of those children has a child (1). So the tree is:

0 (root)
|
0
|
1

and another branch:

0 (root)
|
0
|
1

The initial connected components of 0 are the root and its two children. The components of 1 are the leaves.

The target is 1. So the required operations would be to flip the root's component (0s). Flipping the root would turn all nodes in the root's component (the root and the two children) into 1. Then, the leaves are 1, but the children (now 1) have children that are 1. So after flipping the root's component, all nodes become 1, and the answer is 1.

So in this case, the number of initial 0 regions (which is 1) equals the required operations.

But what if the initial tree has multiple 0 regions? Suppose the tree is split into two separate 0 regions, but connected via 1 nodes. Then each 0 region would need to be flipped once. So the total operations would be the number of 0 regions.

Thus, for a target T, the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of connected components of (1-T) in the initial tree.

Wait, but that's not considering the order of operations. For example, flipping a parent region first might merge some regions. Let's take another example.

Suppose the tree is a chain: 0-1-0-1-0. The target is 1. The initial connected components of 0 are three separate regions (the first node, the third, and the fifth). So according to the previous idea, we need three operations. But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, flipping the third node (0), which is in the middle. Let's see:

Original colors: 0,1,0,1,0.

Painting the third node (0). The path from 3 to itself is 0, so it flips. Now the third node becomes 1. The path from 3 to the first node is 3 (now 1) ← 2 (1) ← 1 (0). Wait, the path from 3 to 1 is 3 (original 0, now flipped to 1?), no. Wait, when you paint a node, the operation changes the color of all nodes u where the path from v to u is all the same color as v's current color. So when you paint node 3 (original color 0), you look for all u where the path from 3 to u is all 0. Then flip those u's colors.

In this example:

Original tree: 0 (node1) -1 (node2) -0 (node3) -1 (node4) -0 (node5)

Painting node3 (color 0). The path from 3 to 3 is just 3, so it's flipped. Then, check paths from 3 to other nodes:

- Path to node2: node3 (0) → node2 (1). Since node2 is 1, which is different from node3's original color (0), the path is not all 0. So only node3 is flipped. After flipping, node3 becomes 1. The colors are now 0,1,1,1,0.

Now, the connected components of 0 are nodes1 and 5. So two regions. So now, painting node1 and node5 would require two more operations, total 3. But according to the initial approach, the answer would be 3, which matches.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's see.

Alternatively, after painting node3 (resulting in colors 0,1,1,1,0), then paint node1 (0). The path from node1 to itself is 0. Flipping it changes node1 to 1. Then, the path from node1 to node2 (1) is all 1? Wait, node1 is now 1, node2 was 1. So the path from node1 to node2 is all 1. So when you paint node1, which is now 1, you look for all u where the path is all 1. So node1, node2, node3, node4 would be part of this. So flipping all of them to 0. Then, the colors would be 0 (after flipping from 1), 0,0,0,0. Wait, but node5 is 0. Then the colors are 0,0,0,0,0. But the target is 1. So that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps this example is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the minimal number of operations is indeed the number of connected components of (1-T) in the initial color array.

But how to verify this?

In the first sample input:

The target is 1. The initial colors are [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1].

Looking for connected components of 0 (since 1-T is 0 when target is 1). Let's see:

The tree structure is given, but perhaps the connected components of 0 are:

- The root (1) and its children (2,3), but node4 is 1. Wait, the initial colors are:

0 (node1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 0 (6), 1 (7), 0 (8), 0 (9), 1 (10), 1 (11).

The tree structure is:

1 connected to 2 and 3.

2 connected to 4 and 5.

5 connected to 6 and 7.

3 connected to 8,9,10.

9 connected to 11.

So, the connected components of 0 are:

- The subtree starting at 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's see:

Nodes 1 (0) is connected to 2 (0), which is connected to 5 (1). So node1 and 2 form a connected component. But wait, node5 is 1, so the connected component of 0 includes node1, 2, and any adjacent nodes that are 0. Wait, node3 is 0 and connected to 1. So node1, 2, 3 are all 0 and connected. So this forms a connected component. Then node6 is 0, connected to 5 (1), which is part of the 1 component. So node6 is another connected component of 0. Similarly, node8 (0) is connected to 3 (0) which is part of the first component. So node8 is part of the first component. Wait, no. Node3 is 0, connected to node8 (0), so they are in the same component.

Wait, let me re-express the tree structure and colors:

Nodes and their colors:

1:0, connected to 2 and 3.

2:0, connected to 1,4,5.

4:1, so not part of 0 component.

5:1, connected to 2,6,7.

6:0 → connected to 5 (1), so 6 is a separate component of 0.

3:0, connected to 1,8,9,10.

8:0 → connected to 3 (0), so part of same component.

9:0 → connected to 3 (0), so part of same component.

9 is connected to 11 (1), which is not part of the component.

10:1 → not part of the 0 component.

So the connected components of 0 are:

Component 1: 1,2,3,8,9.

Component 2: 6.

So two components. So according to the initial approach, the minimal steps for target 1 would be 2, which matches the sample output. So that's correct.

So the approach is:

For each possible target color (0 and 1), compute the number of connected components of (1-T) in the initial tree, then take the minimum between the two. But wait, how about when the target is 0?

In the first sample, the initial colors have 1's. The connected components of 1 (1-T for target 0 is 1) would be:

Nodes 4,5,7,10,11.

But how connected?

Looking at the tree structure:

4 is connected to 2 (0), so 4 is isolated as 1. So component 1:4.

5 is connected to 2 (0), but 5's color is 1. So 5 is in a separate component. 5 is connected to 7 (1). So component 2:5,7.

10 is 1 and connected to 3 (0). So component3:10.

11 is 1, connected to 9 (0). So component4:11.

So for target 0, the number of connected components of 1 is 4. So the steps needed would be 4. So the minimal between 2 (for target 1) and 4 (target 0) is 2, which is the correct answer.

So the approach is to compute, for each target color T, the number of connected components of (1-T) in the tree, then the minimal between the two.

But wait, what about cases where flipping a component can merge other components, thus reducing the required steps? For example, if after flipping a component, adjacent components of the same color (but now their color is flipped) merge, thereby allowing a single operation to flip them all.

But according to the initial model, the steps are based on the initial connected components, not considering the dynamic changes after flips. So why is this model correct?

Because each connected component in the initial (1-T) regions must be flipped exactly once, and these flips are independent. Because when you flip a component, it changes color to T. Adjacent components of (1-T) in the initial state are not adjacent (they are separated by T-colored nodes). So flipping one component doesn't affect the others.

Wait, but in the initial tree, the (1-T) components are connected in the tree? No. Because the tree is a single connected graph, but the (1-T) components are the connected regions of (1-T) color, which may not be connected. For example, in a chain 0-1-0-1-0, the (1-T) components for T=0 are the 1's. Each 1 is a separate component.

So when you flip each 1 (to turn the target to 0), each 1 is a separate component and requires one flip. So the number of operations is the number of (1-T) components.

So the model is correct. The minimal number of steps is the minimal between the two possibilities (target 0 and target 1) of the number of connected components of (1-T) in the initial tree.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Check if all nodes are already the same color. If yes, return 0.

2. Else, for each target T (0 and 1), compute the number of connected components of (1-T) in the tree.

3. The answer is the minimum of the two numbers computed.

But how to compute the number of connected components for each color?

The connected components can be found using a BFS or DFS approach, but considering the colors. For each color c (0 and 1), the connected components are the maximal subsets of nodes with color c such that any two nodes in the subset are connected via edges through nodes of the same color.

So for the tree structure, we can model each node's color, and for each color c, traverse the tree and count the number of connected components where all nodes in the component have color c.

But since the tree is connected, the components for color c are the connected parts of the tree that have color c. For example, in a chain of 0-1-0-1-0, the components for color 0 are three separate components.

But how to compute this efficiently for a tree with up to 2e5 nodes?

An efficient approach would be to traverse the tree once, and for each node, if it has color c and hasn't been visited yet, increment the component count for c, and perform a BFS or DFS to mark all connected nodes of color c.

But since the tree is a graph with edges only between nodes (as per the input), we can represent it as an adjacency list.

But the problem is that for two colors, we need to compute the connected components twice. For example, once for color 0, once for color 1.

But since the tree can have up to 2e5 nodes, doing two full traversals (one for each color) would take O(n) time each, which is acceptable.

So the steps in code would be:

- Read the input.

- Check if all colors are the same. If yes, output 0.

- Else:

   For target T (0 and 1):

      Compute the number of connected components of color (1-T) in the tree.

   The answer is the minimum of these two counts.

So the code structure would be:

n = int(input())

colors = list(map(int, input().split()))

if all same:

   print(0)

else:

   compute count_0 (number of connected components of color 0)

   compute count_1 (number of connected components of color 1)

   for target T=0: required steps is count_1 (since 1-T is 1)

   for target T=1: required steps is count_0

   answer = min(count_1, count_0)

   print(answer)

Wait, no. For target T=0, we need to flip all components of color 1. So the number of steps is the number of connected components of 1. For target T=1, the steps are the number of connected components of 0.

So the code should compute count_1 and count_0 (number of connected components for colors 1 and 0), then the answer is the minimum between count_1 (for target 0) and count_0 (for target 1).

Wait, no. Because for target T=0, the (1-T) is 1. So the required steps are the number of connected components of 1. For target T=1, the required steps are the number of connected components of 0.

Yes. So the code is:

Compute count_0 and count_1 (the number of connected components for color 0 and 1, respectively).

Then, possible answers are:

ans0 = count_1 (steps to flip all 1 components to 0)

ans1 = count_0 (steps to flip all 0 components to 1)

the minimal answer is min(ans0, ans1).

Wait, but in the first sample:

ans0 is count_1 = number of connected components of 1.

Which in the first sample, as per earlier analysis, the connected components of 1 are 4. So ans0 is 4, ans1 is 2. So min(4, 2) is 2, which is correct.

In the second sample, all colors are 0, so count_1 is 0. ans0 is 0, ans1 is count_0 (which is 1). So min is 0, which is correct.

Another example:

n=4, colors [0,0,0,0]. All same. So output 0.

But if the colors are [0,1,0,1], then count_0 is 2 (each 0 is a separate component?), but in a chain structure. So ans0 is count_1 (number of 1 components: 2), ans1 is count_0 (2). So answer is 2.

Wait, but in such a case, the minimal steps would be 2. Let's say the target is 0. Then there are two components of 1. Each needs to be flipped once, so two steps. Same for target 1.

So the approach seems correct.

Thus, the code needs to compute the number of connected components for each color. Then, the minimal of the two counts (for the two targets) is the answer.

So how to compute the number of connected components for each color?

The tree is represented as an adjacency list. For each color c (0 and 1), we need to find the number of connected components where all nodes in the component have color c.

The way to do this is:

For each node in the tree:

   if its color is c and not visited:

      perform BFS/DFS to mark all connected nodes (via edges) that have color c.

      increment the component count for c.

So the steps for each color:

Initialize a visited array (but since the tree can be up to 2e5 nodes, using a list of booleans for each color is feasible.

But wait, for each color, we can process the nodes and track visited for that color.

But in practice, for each color c:

Initialize a visited array (size n) to False.

For each node u from 1 to n:

   if color[u-1] == c and not visited[u-1]:

      perform BFS/DFS to visit all nodes connected to u via edges, but only moving to nodes of color c.

      increment the component count for c.

This way, for each color c, we process all nodes of that color and find their connected components.

But in a tree of 2e5 nodes, this would take O(n) time for each color. So overall O(n) time.

So in Python, this is manageable as long as the code is efficient.

But how to represent the adjacency list? Since the tree is undirected, each edge is added to both nodes' adjacency lists.

Now, let's code this.

First, read n.

Then read the colors.

Check if all colors are the same.

If not, proceed.

Build the adjacency list.

Then, for each color c (0 and 1), compute the number of components.

But how to handle the nodes (since in the problem statement, nodes are 1-based).

So code steps:

n = int(input())

colors = list(map(int, input().split()))

if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors):

    print(0)

else:

    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]

    for _ in range(n-1):

        u, v = map(int, input().split())

        adj[u-1].append(v-1)

        adj[v-1].append(u-1)

    def count_components(target_color):

        visited = [False] * n

        count = 0

        for i in range(n):

            if colors[i] == target_color and not visited[i]:

                count +=1

                stack = [i]

                visited[i] = True

                while stack:

                    node = stack.pop()

                    for neighbor in adj[node]:

                        if colors[neighbor] == target_color and not visited[neighbor]:

                            visited[neighbor] = True

                            stack.append(neighbor)

        return count

    count0 = count_components(0)

    count1 = count_components(1)

    ans = min(count1, count0)

    print(ans)

Wait, but for the target T=0, the required steps are count_components of (1-T) = count_components(1). For T=1, steps are count_components(0). So the minimal of count1 and count0 is the answer.

Yes.

So this code should work.

Testing on sample input 1:

n=11.

colors are 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1.

Compute count_components(0): the number of connected components of 0.

As discussed earlier, count0 is 2 (components 1-2-3-8-9 and 6).

count_components(1) is 4 (components 4,5-7,10,11).

ans = min(4, 2) = 2.

Sample input 2: all 0. So code prints 0.

Another test case: chain 0-1-0-1-0.

count_components(0) is 3 (each 0 is a component).

count_components(1) is 2 (each 1 is a component).

So ans is min(2,3) = 2.

But if the target is 0, steps needed are 2 (each 1 component is flipped once). If target is 1, steps are 3. So the answer is 2.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, let's think about time and memory.

The code uses BFS (stack in the code uses a list and pop() for DFS, which is okay). For each color, we process all nodes. For each node, each edge is checked once per color.

But since each edge is processed twice (once for each color), but the check is O(1). So overall time is O(n) for each color, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

Memory: adjacency list is O(n) for each node's edges. The visited arrays are O(n) each, but for each color, we use a separate array. However, in the code, the visited array is created inside the count_components function, which is called twice. So for each call, a new visited array is created, which may take O(n) space. But for n=2e5, this is 2e5 * 2 * 2 (two visited arrays, each of 2e5 booleans) → around 0.8 MB for two arrays, which is manageable.

So the code should work within the time and memory constraints.

Thus, the correct Python code is as written above.
