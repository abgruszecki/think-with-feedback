<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum product of digits for any number from 1 to n. Hmm. So, for example, when n is 390, the best is 389, which gives 3*8*9=216. 

First, I need to figure out how to approach this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2e9, which is a pretty big number. Iterating through every number from 1 to n is obviously not feasible here. So, brute force is out of the question. We need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the digits of the number. The maximum product is achieved when the digits are as large as possible. But how to structure that?

Wait, for numbers with the same number of digits, the maximum product is likely to be a number composed of as many 9s as possible. But maybe not always. For example, if the number is 390, the maximum is 389, which is 3*8*9. So 8 and 9 here. Hmm. So sometimes, reducing a higher digit by 1 and then filling the rest with 9s might be better.

So the idea is to generate candidates by considering numbers that are just below a certain digit position. For example, take the original number and for each digit, decrease it by 1, set all following digits to 9, and compute the product. Then compare all these candidates plus the original number. The maximum among them is the answer.

Let me think. Let's take the example of 390. The original digits are 3,9,0. For each position:

First digit (3): decrease it by 1 to 2, then set the rest to 9. That would give 299. Product is 2*9*9=162. Not better than 389.

Second digit (9): decrease to 8, set the rest to 9. But that would be 3 8 9 → 389. Product is 3*8*9=216.

Third digit (0): decreasing it would not make sense (since it's already 0), but maybe for other digits.

So the candidate generated is 389, which gives the maximum product. So the approach would generate all such possibilities and take the maximum.

Another example: when n is 7. The candidates are the original (7) and maybe others, but since it's a single digit, the maximum is 7.

For n=1000000000 (1 followed by 9 zeros), the maximum product is 9^9 from 999,999,999. So the candidate here would be the number where the first digit is reduced by 1 (from 1 to 0, but that's not possible). Wait, maybe we should split the number into different lengths. For example, in this case, 1 followed by 9 zeros. But 999,999,999 (9 digits of 9) is 9^9, which is better than 1000000000. So here, the approach would generate 999,999,999 by considering that the original number is 10^9, and the candidate with one fewer digit (all 9s) gives a better product.

So the general approach is:

1. Convert n into a string to process its digits.
2. For each digit position, generate a candidate number by:
   a. Decreasing the current digit by 1. If the digit is 0, maybe skip? Or handle leading zeros?
   b. Set all digits after the current position to 9.
   c. Ensure that this candidate is less than or equal to n. Wait, no. Because when you decrease a digit, the resulting number is definitely less than the original. So for example, in 390, the candidate 299 is less than 390, so it's valid. The candidate 389 is generated by decreasing the second digit (9) to 8 and setting the rest to 9, but wait, that's allowed as long as the digits up to that point are not exceeded. Wait, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps the process is to generate all possible candidates by considering each digit position, then check if the candidate is <=n. Or perhaps the candidate is generated in a way that is guaranteed to be <=n?

Alternatively, for each position i (from 0 to len(s)-1), create a candidate by taking the first i digits, subtract 1 from the i-th digit (if possible), then set the rest to 9. Then, among all these candidates and the original number, compute the product for each and take the maximum.

Wait, but how to handle leading zeros when the first digit is 1? For example, if the number is 1000, then the candidate for i=0 would be 0 followed by 999. But 0999 is 999, which is a valid number. So in that case, the candidate is 999, which is less than 1000. So when generating candidates, even if the first digit is reduced to 0, we just ignore leading zeros? Or perhaps we need to generate the candidate as a number (so 0999 becomes 999). So when processing each candidate, we need to convert it into a valid integer, which would automatically handle leading zeros.

So the steps would be:

- For the original number, generate all possible candidates by modifying each digit position as described.
- For each candidate, process it as a number (so leading zeros are removed).
- Compute the product of digits for each candidate (including the original number).
- The maximum of these products is the answer.

But how to generate the candidates?

Let's take the example of 390 again. The original number is 390. The candidates would be:

- For i=0 (the first digit, 3): subtract 1 to get 2, then set the rest to 9 → 299. Product is 2*9*9=162.
- For i=1 (the second digit, 9): subtract 1 to get 8, then set the rest to 9 → 389. Product is 3*8*9=216.
- For i=2 (the third digit, 0): subtract 1 (but 0-1 is -1, which is invalid. So perhaps in this case, this candidate is not possible. Wait, maybe the original approach is to subtract 1 from the digit at position i, but if the digit is 0, then subtracting 1 would result in a negative, so this candidate is invalid. So perhaps for digits that are 0, we skip generating the candidate? Or maybe we allow it, but then when generating the candidate, it's possible that the number is invalid (like 39-1 at position 2 would be 38-1? Not sure. Maybe the candidate generation is only possible when the digit can be subtracted by 1 without causing a carry over. Wait, perhaps the approach is to take the digits up to i, subtract 1 from the i-th digit, then set the rest to 9. But if the i-th digit was 0, subtracting 1 would make it 9 (but with a borrow from previous digits). Oh right, that's a problem. So maybe this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to generate the candidate is as follows: take the first i digits, subtract 1 from the i-th digit (if possible, i.e., the i-th digit is at least 1), then append 9s for the remaining digits.

Wait, for example, let's take the number as a string. For each position i where the digit is at least 1, we create a candidate by:

- Taking the first i digits as a number, subtract 1 from the i-th digit (so if the digits up to i are 'abc', then subtract 1 from the i-th character, and then append 9s for the rest).

But perhaps the correct way is:

For each i from 0 to length-1:

- Split the digits into two parts: left part up to i, and the rest.
- If the left part is empty (i=0?), then subtract 1 from the first digit. But if the first digit is 1, subtracting 1 would result in 0, then all 9s. But the candidate would be 0 followed by 9s, which is 9s of length one less. For example, if the number is 1000, then the candidate for i=0 is 0999, which is 999. Which is allowed.

So the steps would be:

Generate all candidates where for some position i, the first i+1 digits are modified by subtracting 1 (if possible) and then the rest are 9. Then, compute the product of the digits of each candidate, as well as the original number. The maximum is the answer.

But how to generate those candidates properly?

Let's see. For a number like '390' (digits '3','9','0'):

- i=0: take first 1 digits (3), subtract 1 → 2, then append two 9s → 299. Product is 2*9*9=162.
- i=1: take first 2 digits (3,9), subtract 1 from the second digit (9 becomes 8), then append 9 for the last digit → 389. Product 3*8*9=216.
- i=2: take first 3 digits (3,9,0). Subtract 1 from the third digit (0 becomes -1, which is invalid). So skip this candidate.

So for each i, we check if the digit at i is >=1. If not, then subtracting 1 would require a borrow, which would make the previous digits change. But in that case, the approach of simply subtracting 1 from the current digit and setting the rest to 9 may not work.

Wait, but this approach might not capture all possibilities. For example, if the digit is 0, subtracting 1 would require a borrow. But generating such candidates would not be possible with the current method, leading to missing some potential candidates. So perhaps this approach isn't sufficient.

Alternative approach: For each possible candidate, the number is formed by decreasing a certain digit by 1 and filling the rest with 9's. But for digits that are 0, subtracting 1 would not be possible. So perhaps only generate candidates for digits that are >=1.

Wait, but for the third digit in 390 (0), subtracting 1 is not possible. So the candidate for i=2 is invalid. So the correct candidates are those generated for digits >=1.

So the steps would be:

1. Convert the input number n into a string s.
2. Generate all possible candidates by modifying each digit (s[i]) to s[i]-1 (if s[i] > '0'), then set the following digits to '9'. Also, include the original number as a candidate.
3. For each candidate, convert it to an integer (which automatically removes leading zeros), then check if it is <=n. Wait, but the candidate may be larger than n. For example, if the original number is 999, then any candidate (by modifying digits) would be 999, 998, 999 (no change?), but in that case, the original number is the maximum.

Wait, no. Because when you modify a digit, you subtract 1 from that digit, then set the rest to 9. The resulting number is always less than the original number. For example, the original number is 390. The candidates are 299, 389, and 390 (original). Wait, 389 is less than 390, right? Because 389 < 390. So all the generated candidates are <= the original number. So the original number is included as a candidate. Therefore, all candidates are valid (<=n), so no need to check.

Wait, because when you generate a candidate by modifying s[i], you subtract 1 from s[i], and set the rest to 9. Since the original number is s, which is the maximum possible number (n), modifying any digit to be smaller (since we subtract 1) and the rest to 9 (which can't exceed the original digits if they were higher). Wait, no. For example, suppose the original number is 1000. The candidate generated for i=0 would be 0 followed by 999 (which is 999), which is less than 1000. For i=1, the first digit is 1, then subtract 1 from the second digit (0 becomes 9? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the original digits are '1','0','0','0'. For i=1 (the second digit), which is 0. But according to the approach, you can't subtract 1 from 0. So this candidate is not generated. So in this case, the only candidates are the original (1000) and the candidates where the digit is >0.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to generate for each i, the candidate where we subtract 1 from the i-th digit (regardless of whether it's possible?), but then that could result in a number that's lower than n. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to generate candidates where we take the first i digits as a number, subtract 1, then append 9's. But in this case, even if the first i digits are 100...0, subtracting 1 would reduce it to 99...9.

Wait, perhaps this is a better way. For example, for the original number s, for each possible split into two parts: the first part is s[0...i], and the second part is s[i+1...]. The candidate is formed by:

candidate = s[0...i] - 1 followed by all 9s in the remaining positions.

But how to handle cases where s[0...i] is 0? For example, if the original number is 1000, and i=0 (split after the first digit, which is 1). Then s[0...0] is 1, subtract 1 gives 0, then the remaining digits are 999. So the candidate is 0999 → 999, which is valid.

Another example: original number is 999. For each i:

i=0: 9-1=8, followed by 99 → 899. Product 8*9*9=648.
i=1: 99 → 98 followed by 9 → 989. Product 9*8*9=648.
i=2: 999-1=998 → 998. Product 9*9*8=648. So the maximum is the original, 999 (product 729).

So including the original number as a candidate is necessary.

So the algorithm steps are:

1. Convert the input number n to a string s.
2. Generate all possible candidates by modifying each possible i (from 0 to len(s)-1) as follows:
   a. Take the first i+1 digits as a number, subtract 1.
   b. If the result is a number with i+1 digits (i.e., no leading zeros after subtraction?), append as many 9s as needed to reach the original length minus (i+1) digits?
   c. For example, s is "390". For i=1 (first two digits, "39"), subtract 1 to get 38, then append 9 for the third digit → 389.
3. Also include the original number as a candidate.
4. For each candidate, convert it to an integer (which removes leading zeros), but ensure that it's a valid positive integer (since 0 is allowed only if n is 0, but n is at least 1). However, when generating the candidate, if the first i+1 digits become zero after subtraction (like in the 1000 example), the candidate would start with 0 followed by 9s. Converting to integer would remove leading zeros, so for example, 0999 becomes 999, which is valid.
5. For each candidate, compute the product of its digits.
6. Take the maximum product among all candidates.

Wait, but when we subtract 1 from the first i+1 digits, it's possible that the number becomes a number with fewer digits. For example, if the first i+1 digits are "10", subtracting 1 gives "9", but then when appending 9s, the length of the candidate would be same as the original. So perhaps the candidate is formed by taking the first i+1 digits, subtracting 1, then appending 9s to make the total length equal to the original.

So for example, s = "390" (length 3). For i=0, subtract 1 from "3" to get "2", then append two 9s → "299". For i=1, subtract 1 from "39" (which is 39) to get 38, then append one 9 → "389". For i=2, subtract 1 from "390" (390) to get 389, append zero 9s → "389" (but in this case, the third digit is 0-1 which would require a borrow. Wait, but when we subtract 1 from the entire number up to i=2 (which is 390), subtract 1 to get 389. But the original number is 390, which is larger than the candidate. But this candidate is the same as the candidate for i=1. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct. Wait, perhaps the candidate for i=2 would be 389, which is 390-1. But in that case, the candidate for i=2 is 389, which is the same as the candidate for i=1. So in this example, it's redundant, but in other cases, perhaps not.

But how to generate these candidates correctly. For each i, the candidate is (number formed by first i+1 digits minus 1) followed by len(s) - (i+1) 9s. So for example, in the case where s is "1000", len(s) is 4. For i=0, first i+1=1 digits: "1". Subtract 1 to get 0. Then append 3 9s → "0999", which becomes 999 when converted to integer. For i=1, first two digits are "10", subtract 1 to get 9 (as a two-digit number would be 09?), but wait, that's not right. Wait, "10" is 10, subtract 1 → 9. Then append two 9s → "9" + "99" → "999". Which is 999, which is less than 1000. So the candidate here would be 999. But how to handle the leading zeros in the first part after subtraction?

Ah, perhaps the first part is treated as a number. So for the first i+1 digits, we subtract 1 to get a number, then we convert that number back to a string with leading zeros as necessary to have i+1 digits. For example, if the first part is "10" (i+1=2 digits), subtract 1 to get 9, which is a one-digit number. So we need to pad it with leading zeros to make it two digits: "09". Then append the 9s. So for i=1 in "1000", the candidate would be "09" + "99" → "0999" → 999. Which is correct.

So the algorithm steps would be:

For each i in 0 to len(s)-1:

1. Take the first i+1 characters of s as a substring.
2. Convert this substring to an integer and subtract 1. If the result is negative (like when the substring is "0"), skip this candidate. But wait, in the problem, n is at least 1, so the original number can't be 0. So for i=0, the first digit is at least 1. So subtracting 1 would be at least 0. For example, if the first digit is 1, subtracting 1 gives 0. So the candidate is 0 followed by 9s. Which is allowed.

So even if after subtraction the first part is 0, that's okay. Because when you pad it to the same length as i+1 digits (with leading zeros if needed?), then append the 9s. Wait, but how to pad it? For example, first part is "1" (i=0), subtract 1 gives 0. Then, the next step is to create a string of length i+1 (1) digits. So "0". Then append len(s) - (i+1) 9s (3 in this case for "1000"). So the candidate is "0" + "999" → "0999" → 999.

Another example: first part is "10" (i=1, s is "1000"). Subtract 1 gives 9. Need to represent this as a two-digit string. So leading zero is added → "09". Then append two 9s → "09" + "99" → "0999" → 999.

So the correct way is:

After subtracting 1 from the first i+1 digits, we need to format the result as a string of length i+1, possibly with leading zeros. Then append the remaining digits as 9s.

So for each i:

- first_part_str = s[0..i]
- first_part_num = int(first_part_str)
- first_part_num -=1
- if first_part_num <0: skip (but since s is at least 1, first_part_str can't be zero for i=0)
- new_first_part_str = str(first_part_num).zfill(i+1) → pads with leading zeros to make it length i+1
- candidate_str = new_first_part_str + '9'*(len(s) - i -1)
- candidate_num = int(candidate_str)
- if candidate_num <1: skip (but since n >=1, the original candidate can't be zero)
- add candidate_num to the list of candidates

But in the case where first_part_num becomes zero after subtraction, like when i=0 and first_part_num is 1 (n=1000), then new_first_part_str is '0', and the candidate is 0999 → 999.

So the process would generate all possible candidates correctly.

Once all candidates are generated, including the original number, we compute the product of digits for each candidate and take the maximum.

Now, the question is how to compute the product of digits for a number. For a number like 999, the product is 9*9*9=729. For 389, it's 3*8*9=216.

But how to compute this efficiently. For numbers up to 2e9, the maximum number of digits is 10. So for each candidate, which can have up to 10 digits, the product can be computed in O(10) time, which is acceptable.

So the steps for the code would be:

1. Read the input n as a string (since handling digits is easier as a string).
2. Generate all possible candidates as described.
3. Also add the original number (n) as a candidate.
4. For each candidate, convert it to a string (without leading zeros), compute the product of its digits.
5. Keep track of the maximum product.

Now, handling leading zeros: when we generate a candidate like '0999', converting to an integer gives 999, but when converting back to a string, it's '999'. So the product would be 9*9*9=729. But in reality, the candidate is 999, which is correct. So the code can process the candidate as an integer, then convert it to a string to get the digits.

But wait, when the candidate is generated as '0999', converting to integer gives 999. So when we convert it to a string, it's '999'. The code will compute 9*9*9=729, which is correct. So this approach works.

But what if the candidate after conversion is 0? For example, if the original number is 1. Then the candidate for i=0 is 0, which is 0. But the product is 0, which is less than 1. So the code would take the maximum between 0 and 1, which is correct.

So the code will generate all possible candidates, including those that, after leading zeros are stripped, become numbers less than n. But since the original number is included as a candidate, the maximum is correctly considered.

Now, let's think about the edge cases.

Case 1: n=1. Then the only candidate is 1. The product is 1.

Case 2: n=10. The original number is 10. The candidates are:

i=0: 0 followed by 9 → 09 → 9. Product is 9.

i=1: first two digits (10) minus 1 →9 → append 0 9s →9 → product is 9.

Original candidate is 10 → product 0.

So maximum is 9.

But wait, the maximum product between 1 and 10 is 9 (digits of 9). So the code would generate 9 as a candidate (from i=0: 0 followed by 9 →9). So the code works.

Another example: n=10. The code would generate candidates 09 (9), 19 (from i=1: 10-1=9, append 0 9s →9?), wait, no. Let's see.

Original number is 10, which is '10' as a string. len(s) is 2.

For i=0:

first_part_str is '1', subtract 1 →0. new_first_part_str is '0' (since it's length i+1=1). append len(s)-i-1=1 9s → '0' + '9' → '09' →9. product is 9.

For i=1:

first_part_str is '10', subtract 1 →9. new_first_part_str must be 2 digits → '09'. append 0 9s → '09' →09 →9. product 9.

Original candidate is 10 → product 0.

So the maximum is 9. Correct.

Another edge case: n=4321. The maximum product is 9*9*9=729 (from 999?), but wait, 4321 is less than 999. So no. Wait, 4321 is a four-digit number. The candidate generated by i=0 would be 3 followed by three 9s → 3999. Which is 3999. But 3999 is larger than 4321. Oh wait, no. 3999 is less than 4321. So the candidate 3999 would be valid. The product is 3*9*9*9 = 2187. But that's higher than 4321's product (4*3*2*1=24). So the code would generate 3999 as a candidate and compute its product. But wait, how?

Wait, the original number is 4321. The candidates are generated by each i from 0 to 3.

For i=0:

original first digit is 4. subtract 1 →3. append three 9s →3999. product is 3*9*9*9=2187.

For i=1:

first two digits are '43'. subtract 1 →42. append two 9s →4299. product is4*2*9*9= 648.

For i=2:

first three digits are '432'. subtract 1 →431. append one 9 →4319. product is4*3*1*9= 108.

For i=3:

first four digits are '4321'. subtract 1 →4320. append zero 9s →4320. product is 4*3*2*0=0.

Original candidate is 4321 → product 4*3*2*1=24.

So the maximum is 2187. So the answer would be 2187. Which is correct. So the code would generate that.

So the approach works for this case.

Now, the code implementation.

In Python:

We need to generate all possible candidates, including the original number. Then compute the product for each and return the maximum.

Steps:

1. Read n as a string.

2. Generate all candidates.

For each i in 0 to len(n)-1:

   a. Take first i+1 characters.

   b. Convert to integer, subtract 1.

   c. If the result is negative, skip (but since n >=1, the first digit is >=1, so i=0's first part is >=1, subtracting 1 gives 0 or higher. So no need to check.)

   d. Convert back to string, pad with leading zeros to make i+1 digits.

   e. Append '9's for the remaining digits.

   f. Convert the candidate string to integer, then to string again (to handle leading zeros).

3. Also add the original number as a candidate.

4. Compute the product of digits for each candidate.

5. Return the maximum.

But how to handle the original number as a candidate? For example, if n is 999, the original is included. For each candidate generated, the code will check all possibilities.

So in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n_str = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    max_product = 0

    candidates = []

    length = len(n_str)

    for i in range(length):

        # first i+1 digits

        first_part = n_str[:i+1]

        # subtract 1

        first_num = int(first_part)

        first_num -=1

        if first_num <0:

            continue # shouldn't happen for n >=1

        # convert to string, pad with leading zeros to i+1 digits

        new_first_part = str(first_num).zfill(i+1)

        # create the candidate

        candidate = new_first_part + '9'*(length - (i+1))

        # convert to integer and then back to string to avoid leading zeros

        candidate_str = str(int(candidate)) if candidate else '0'

        # but if the candidate is 0, then it's not considered (since n >=1)

        # but when first_num is 0 followed by 9s, it's possible.

        # but in code, after converting to int and back to str, leading zeros are removed.

        # so for candidate_str, it's the number without leading zeros.

        # but candidate_str can't be empty. For example, when candidate is '0'.

        # So, add all possible candidates except those that are zero?

        # But since n >=1, the original number is at least 1. So the code can process all candidates, including 0 (but the original number will have a higher product).

        candidates.append(candidate)

    # add the original number as a candidate

    candidates.append(n_str)

    # now process all candidates:

    for candidate in candidates:

        # convert to integer, then to string to process digits.

        num = int(candidate)

        if num ==0:

            product =0

        else:

            product = 1

            s = str(num)

            for ch in s:

                product *= int(ch)

        if product > max_product:

            max_product = product

    print(max_product, file=output_stream)

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n_str = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    max_product = 0

    candidates = []

    length = len(n_str)

    for i in range(length):

        # first i+1 digits

        first_part = n_str[:i+1]

        # subtract 1

        first_num = int(first_part)

        first_num -=1

        if first_num <0:

            continue # shouldn't happen for n >=1

        # convert to string, pad with leading zeros to i+1 digits

        new_first_part = str(first_num).zfill(i+1)

        # create the candidate

        candidate = new_first_part + '9'*(length - (i+1))

        # convert to integer and then back to string to avoid leading zeros

        candidate_str = str(int(candidate)) if candidate else '0'

        # but if the candidate is 0, then it's not considered (since n >=1)

        # but when first_num is 0 followed by 9s, it's possible.

        # but in code, after converting to int and back to str, leading zeros are removed.

        # so for candidate_str, it's the number without leading zeros.

        # but candidate_str can't be empty. For example, when candidate is '0'.

        # So, add all possible candidates except those that are zero?

        # But since n >=1, the original number is at least 1. So the code can process all candidates, including 0 (but the original number will have a higher product).

        candidates.append(candidate)

    # add the original number as a candidate

    candidates.append(n_str)

    # now process all candidates:

    for candidate in candidates:

        # convert to integer, then to string to process digits.

        num = int(candidate)

        if num ==0:

            product =0

        else:

            product = 1

            s = str(num)

            for ch in s:

                product *= int(ch)

Third example: input 1000000000 → '1000000000'.

Generate candidates:

i=0: first_part '1' →0 → append 9 9s → '0999999999' → converted to 999999999 → product 9^9.

i=1: first_part '10' →10-1=9 → '09' → append 8 9s → '0999999999' → 999999999.

Similarly, all i from 0 to 8 (since the number has 10 digits):

For any i <9, the candidate would be 999999999. For example, i=9 (the last digit) → first_part is '1000000000', subtract 1 → 999999999 → append 0 9s → 999999999.

Original candidate: 1000000000 → product 0.

So the maximum product is 9^9=387420489. Correct.

So the code should work.

Another test case: n=10.

Candidates generated:

For i=0: '0' + '9' → '09' →9. product 9.

For i=1: '10' →9 → '09' →9 → product 9.

Original candidate: 10 → product 0.

So maximum is 9. Correct.

Another test case: n=4321.

The code would generate candidate for i=0: 3999 → product 3*9*9*9=2187. Which is the maximum.

Thus, the code works.

Now, the code needs to handle the case where the candidate is 0, but since the original number is included, and the original number is >=1, the product for 0 is 0, which will be less than the original's product (which is at least 1 if the original is 1). So no problem.

Now, in code:

But in Python, for the candidates list, when generating the candidates, the code adds the string representations of the candidates (before converting to integer). So for example, when generating a candidate for i=0 in '1000', the code would add '0999' to the candidates list. Then, when processing each candidate, the code converts it to an integer (like 999) and then to a string '999' to compute the product.

So the code for generating candidates is:

for i in range(len(n_str)):

    first_part = n_str[:i+1]

    first_num = int(first_part) -1

    new_first_part = str(first_num).zfill(i+1)

    candidate = new_first_part + '9'*(len(n_str) - i -1)

    candidates.append(candidate)

Then append the original n_str.

So for each candidate in candidates, the code converts to integer and then to a string.

But what if the candidate is '0' (for example, when n_str is '1', then i=0 gives first_part '1' →0, new_first_part '0' → candidate is '0'). But when converting to integer, it's 0. Then, when processing, the product is 0. The original number is 1, product is 1. So the maximum is 1. Correct.

Thus, the code works.

So the code is as follows.
</think>

```python
n = input().strip()
max_product = 0
candidates = []
length = len(n)

for i in range(length):
    first_part = n[:i+1]
    first_num = int(first_part) - 1
    if first_num < 0:
        continue
    new_first_part = str(first_num).zfill(i+1)
    candidate = new_first_part + '9' * (length - i - 1)
    candidates.append(candidate)

candidates.append(n)

for candidate in candidates:
    num = int(candidate)
    if num == 0:
        product = 0
    else:
        product = 1
        s = str(num)
        for ch in s:
            product *= int(ch)
    if product > max_product:
        max_product = product

print(max_product)
```
