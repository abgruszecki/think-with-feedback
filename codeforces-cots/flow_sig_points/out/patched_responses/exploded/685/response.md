Okay, let's see. We need to find out how many monsters are "afraid" of Limak. A monster is afraid if it can be hit by an arrow that Limak shoots after teleporting using some combination of his stones. Since he can use the stones in any order, but each stone at most once, the problem is about considering all possible subsets of stones (since order might not matter here, depending on the scenario) and then for each possible teleportation point (each stone's location) that he uses in sequence, determine if a monster can be hit.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each stone can be used at most once. So the stones are used in sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the description says that each stone can be used at most once. So Limak can teleport using a stone once. But how? Like, he starts at some initial position (maybe not specified), and then uses each stone once to teleport to their locations. But the order of using the stones might affect the positions he's in. Because after each teleport, he can shoot an arrow from that position. So the total number of arrows he can shoot is up to the number of stones used, because each stone is used once, and each time he uses a stone, he can shoot an arrow from that new position.

Wait, the problem statement says: "Limak can use stones in any order. After each teleportation, Limak can shoot an arrow in some direction. An arrow will hit the first monster in the chosen direction. Then, both an arrow and a monster disappear. Itâ€™s dangerous to stay in one place for long, so Limak can shoot only one arrow from one place."

So for each stone he uses, he teleports to that stone's location, then shoots one arrow. So the order in which he uses the stones determines the sequence of positions from which he can shoot. For example, if he uses stone A then stone B, he will first be at A's position and shoot an arrow (hitting a monster in some direction), then teleport to B's position and shoot another arrow. Each arrow is shot from a different position (the position after teleporting using a stone), and each stone is used exactly once if he chooses to use it.

Wait, but the stones can be used in any order, and each stone can be used at most once. So Limak can choose any subset of stones (including all of them) to use. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each stone can be used at most once. So Limak can use any subset of the stones, possibly all of them. For example, if he has k stones, he can choose to use 0 stones (so he never teleports, but then he can't shoot any arrows?), but that's probably not allowed. Wait, the problem says "each stone can be used at most once. Each stone can be used at most once. The i-th stone allows to teleport to (axi, ayi). So when he uses a stone, he teleports to that point, and can then shoot an arrow. So the total number of arrows he can shoot is equal to the number of stones he uses. Because each stone's use gives him a position to shoot from.

Wait, but the problem says "Limak can use stones in any order." So the order in which he uses the stones determines the sequence of positions he can shoot from.

So for example, if there are 2 stones, he can use stone 1 first (teleport there and shoot), then stone 2 (teleport there and shoot). Or use stone 2 first, then stone 1. Each of these sequences allows two shots, each from a different position.

But when considering whether a monster can be hit, we have to think of all possible subsets of stones (including all possible permutations, since the order of teleporting affects the order in which arrows are shot, which could affect which monsters are still present when each arrow is shot). Because each arrow shot removes the monster it hits. So the order of shooting matters: if a monster is hit in the first shot, it's no longer there for the second shot.

But considering all possible subsets and permutations of stones is computationally expensive. However, given that k is up to 7, even permutations of all possible subsets (like for k=7, the number of permutations is 7! = 5040) is manageable, especially since n is up to 1000. Because for each permutation (sequence of stones used), we need to simulate the arrows being shot and see which monsters are hit. But n is 1000, and for each permutation, we need to process each step (each stone in the permutation) and for each step, determine which monster is hit when shooting in a certain direction. However, for each permutation, the maximum steps are up to 7 (since k is up to 7). So the total possible permutations are up to 7! = 5040. For each permutation, for each step (up to 7), we need to check for each monster if it's the first in some direction. Wait, but how do we model the direction chosen by Limak? Because Limak can choose any direction. So, for each step (position), Limak can choose a direction that hits a monster (if any exists in that direction). The problem is, for a given position (after teleporting), which monsters are possible to hit, considering that the direction can be chosen optimally to hit any of the first monsters in some direction.

But the problem is to find all monsters that can be hit in at least one possible scenario (i.e., in some sequence of stone usages and direction choices). So the question is: for a monster m, is there a subset of stones (possibly all of them) arranged in some order (permutation of the subset) such that, when Limak uses the stones in that order, he can shoot arrows in directions that hit m in one of those steps, given that any monsters hit in earlier steps are no longer present.

This seems computationally intensive. Because for each possible permutation of any subset of the stones (including all possible subsets), we have to track which monsters are hit in each step, and then for each monster, check if there's at least one permutation where it is hit.

But with k up to 7, the total number of possible permutations of subsets is sum_{s=1 to k} (k choose s) * s! ) = sum_{s=1 to 7} P(k, s) ). For k=7, sum from s=1 to 7 of 7!/(7-s)! ). Let's compute that for k=7: s=1:7, s=2:7*6=42, s=3: 7*6*5=210, s=4:7*6*5*4=840, s=5: 7*6*5*4*3=2520, s=6:7!/(7-6)! = 5040, s=7: 5040. Sum all these: 7+42=49, +210=259, +840=1099, +2520=3619, +5040=8659, +5040=13699. So for k=7, there are 13,699 possible permutations of subsets. For each of these permutations, we need to simulate the process of shooting arrows, each time choosing a direction that hits a monster (if possible), and the direction is chosen optimally to hit a monster that is in the direction chosen. But since Limak can choose any direction, for each position, the arrows can hit any monster that is in the line of sight (i.e., the first monster in that direction). But the problem says that Limak can choose the direction optimally. So for each step (position), when Limak is there, he can choose any direction that allows him to hit a monster (if any are left). So the order of shooting in the steps affects which monsters are available.

The key is to find, for each monster, whether there exists a permutation of a subset of stones, and a sequence of direction choices in each step of that permutation, such that the monster is hit in one of the steps.

But how to model this efficiently?

Alternative approach: For a monster to be hit, there must be at least one position (from the stones) such that the monster is visible from that position. But even that's not sufficient, because maybe after using that stone, in the sequence of steps, another arrow could have hit a monster that's in the same direction, making the target monster not the first one anymore. Wait, no. Because when you use the stone's position, you can choose the direction optimally. So if the monster is visible (i.e., no other monster is in the same direction closer to the position), then Limak can choose to shoot in that direction, thereby hitting the monster. However, the problem is that other steps (earlier steps) might have already eliminated that monster.

Wait, but the monster can be hit in any of the steps. For example, if a stone's position is such that the monster is visible from there, then in the permutation that uses that stone first, Limak can choose to hit that monster. If that's possible, then the monster should be counted as afraid.

But the problem is that other stones' positions may also have the same or other monsters in their line of sight. So the monster is considered "afraid" if there exists at least one way (a permutation of a subset of stones) such that in one of the steps (when Limak is at that stone's position), the monster is visible (i.e., no other monster is along the line from the stone's position to the monster's position, and the monster is the first in that direction), and Limak chooses to shoot in that direction during that step, and that step occurs before any other steps that could have hit the monster.

Wait, no. Because once a monster is hit in a step, it's removed and can't be hit again. So for the monster to be hit, it must be the case that during some step (when Limak is at a position from a stone), the monster is visible (i.e., there's a direction from that position where the monster is the first in that direction), and Limak chooses to shoot in that direction during that step. Also, that step must occur before any step where another arrow is shot that would hit the monster (but that's impossible, since once hit, it's gone).

So the problem reduces to: for each monster m, is there at least one stone's position (from the k stones) such that m is visible from that position (i.e., there's a direction from that position to m where m is the first monster in that direction). And also, the stone's position is part of a subset of stones used in some permutation where, when Limak is at that position, the m hasn't been hit in a previous step.

But how can we model this? Because the order of the stones used determines the order of steps. For example, if a monster is visible from position A and position B, then even if in some permutation where A comes after B, if in B's step the monster is not hit (because Limak chose to shoot another direction), then in A's step, he can hit the monster. So for a monster to be counted as afraid, it's sufficient that there exists at least one position (stone) where the monster is visible from that position, and in some permutation where that position is used in a step where the monster is still present (i.e., hasn't been hit in a prior step).

But how to model that for all possible permutations and possible choices of direction? Because in permutations where the position is used in the first step, the monster is definitely present. If the monster is visible from that position, then Limak can choose to hit it. So if a monster is visible from any stone's position, then it can be hit in the permutation where that stone is used first, and the direction is chosen towards the monster. Therefore, the monster should be considered afraid.

But wait, this is not true. Because when the stone's position is used in the first step, the monster is visible (i.e., there's a direction where the monster is the first one). So Limak can choose that direction, hit the monster, and then the monster is removed. So in that case, the monster is hit, so it's counted.

But what if there are other monsters along the same direction from that position? For example, if a stone's position is at (0,0), and there are two monsters at (1,0) and (2,0). Then, from (0,0), the first monster in the (right) direction is (1,0). So Limak can shoot in that direction, hitting (1,0), and the (2,0) monster is not hit. But if Limak chooses to shoot in the direction of (2,0), he can't hit it unless (1,0) is already removed. But in the first step, (1,0) is present, so the direction towards (2,0) would have (1,0) in front. So in that case, the first hit would be (1,0), and (2,0) would not be hit unless (1,0) is removed first. So for (2,0) to be hit, there must be a position where (2,0) is the first monster in some direction, and Limak can choose to hit it in that step.

So the key insight is: a monster m is afraid if and only if there exists at least one stone's position s such that m is the first monster along some direction from s, and there are no other monsters (other than m) along the line from s to m that are closer to s. In other words, m is visible from s. Because if that's the case, then in the permutation where s is the first stone used, Limak can choose to shoot in the direction of m, hitting it, and thus m is considered afraid.

Wait, that's the key. Because if m is visible from s, then if s is used in a step where m is present (i.e., prior steps didn't hit m), then Limak can choose to hit m in that step. But if s is used in the first step, then m is present, and thus can be hit. So if any stone's position s has m visible, then m can be hit in the permutation where s is the first stone. So regardless of other permutations, if there's even one stone from which m is visible, then m should be counted as afraid.

But wait, perhaps there's a scenario where m is visible from s, but in the permutation where s is used, but m is hit in a previous step by another stone's position. For example, suppose there's another stone s', and from s', m is visible, and in a permutation where s' is used before s. Then when Limak uses s' first, he can choose to hit m. So when the permutation is s' followed by s, m is hit in the first step, and thus s's step can't hit m. But in the permutation where s is used first, m is hit. So regardless of other permutations, as long as m is visible from at least one stone's position, then m can be hit in some permutation (e.g., the one where that stone is the first step). Thus, the presence of any such stone's position s where m is visible implies that m is afraid.

Therefore, the problem reduces to: for each monster m, check if there exists at least one stone's position s (among the k stones) such that m is visible from s, i.e., there is no other monster lying on the line segment between s and m. Because if that's the case, then in the permutation where s is used first, Limak can choose to hit m.

Wait, no. Because the line from s to m may have other monsters that are not in between s and m, but in the same direction but farther away. Those monsters are not in the line segment between s and m, but are in the same direction. For example, s is at (0,0), m is at (2,0), and another monster is at (4,0). Then, from s's position, m is the first in the direction of (2,0). So Limak can hit m by shooting in that direction. So the presence of other monsters in the same line but farther away doesn't block m from being hit. So the visibility here is defined as: m is the first monster in some direction from s. So the question is, for a given s and m, are there any other monsters lying along the line from s to m, and are strictly between s and m (i.e., closer to s than m is)? Because that's what would block m from being the first hit in that direction.

So the steps are:

For each monster m, check if there exists a stone s such that no other monster lies on the line segment between s and m. Because if there are no other monsters in between, then m is the first in that direction from s. Then, Limak can choose to use s first and hit m. Therefore, m is considered afraid.

So the problem reduces to, for each monster, check if there exists any stone s such that the line segment from s to m has no other monsters. If so, then the monster is afraid.

But wait, this is not the case. Because even if there's a monster in the same line but beyond m (i.e., farther from s than m is), that doesn't block m. So the line segment between s and m is the key. Any other monsters on that line segment (i.e., between s and m) would block m from being the first hit.

Therefore, the solution is:

For each monster m, check if there exists any stone s (among the k stones) such that there is no other monster lying on the line segment between s and m. If yes, then m is afraid.

So how to implement this?

The steps would be:

1. For each stone s in the stones list:

   a. For each monster m in the monsters list:

      i. Check if there is any other monster (other than m) that lies on the line segment between s and m.

      ii. If there are none, then m is visible from s, and thus can be hit by shooting from s in the direction of m.

2. For each monster m, count 1 if there exists at least one stone s where the above condition is true. Otherwise, count 0.

The sum of all such counts is the answer.

So this approach is O(k * n^2), which for k=7 and n=1000 would be 7*1000*1000 = 7,000,000 operations. Which is manageable.

But how to check whether any other monster lies on the line segment between s and m?

For each pair (s, m), we need to check for all other monsters (m') whether m' is on the line segment between s and m.

So for each s, m:

   check all m' (other than m) if they are colinear with s and m, and lie on the segment between s and m.

But this is O(k * n * (n-1)) = O(knÂ²) time, which is acceptable for n=1000 and k=7: 7 * 1000 * 999 = about 6,993,000 operations. That's manageable.

So the plan is:

- Iterate over each stone s.

- For each monster m:

   - Check if any other monster m' is on the line segment between s and m.

   - If not, then m can be hit from s (so the answer for m is yes).

- After checking all s, if any s allows m to be visible, count m.

Now, how to check if a monster m' is on the line segment between s and m.

Given two points s (ax, ay) and m (mx, my), and a third point m' (mx', my'), check if:

a. m' is colinear with s and m.

b. m' lies between s and m.

For colinearity:

The vectors s -> m and s -> m' must be scalar multiples. So, the cross product of (m - s) and (m' - s) should be zero.

So, (mx - ax)*(my' - ay) - (my - ay)*(mx' - ax) should be zero.

For the point m' to be between s and m, it's coordinates must lie within the bounding box of s and m. So:

the x-coordinate of m' must be between min(ax, mx) and max(ax, mx), and the y-coordinate must be between min(ay, my) and max(ay, my).

But even that's not sufficient. For example, the point could be colinear but not lie within the segment. But with the colinearity checked, then checking that the coordinates are between is sufficient.

But to avoid floating point operations, we can do integer-based checks.

So, for a point m' (x, y), to lie on the segment between s (ax, ay) and m (mx, my):

1. The cross product of (m - s) and (m' - s) is zero. That's for colinearity.

2. The dot product of (m' - s) and (m - s') must be non-negative and less than or equal to the squared distance between s and m. Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, after ensuring colinearity, check that m' is between s and m. To do this:

We can check that:

- the x-coordinate of m' is between ax and mx (inclusive), assuming the line is not vertical. For vertical lines, check the y-coordinates.

But this approach may have edge cases. For example, if the line is horizontal, and the x-coordinate is between, but the y is same. But given that the cross product is zero (colinear), then if the x is between, the point is on the segment.

Alternatively, the parametric approach. For the line segment from s to m, any point on the segment can be written as s + t*(m - s), where t is between 0 and 1 (inclusive). So for m' to be on the segment, there must exist t in [0, 1] such that:

x = ax + t*(mx - ax)

y = ay + t*(my - ay)

But solving for t for each coordinate (assuming mx != ax or my != ay) would require that both equations give the same t. However, this can lead to division operations which can introduce floating points. But since all coordinates are integers, perhaps we can avoid floating points.

Alternatively, for integers:

If the line from s to m is vertical (mx == ax), then m' must have x == ax, and y between min(ay, my) and max(ay, my).

If the line is horizontal (my == ay), then m' must have y == ay, and x between ax and mx (the min and max).

Otherwise, we can check if (mx - ax)*(y' - ay) == (my - ay)*(x' - ax), which is the cross product (colinearity), and then check that x' is between ax and mx, and y' is between ay and my.

But perhaps the following approach is better:

For the line segment between s and m, after verifying colinearity, check that:

min(ax, mx) â‰¤ x' â‰¤ max(ax, mx)

and

min(ay, my) â‰¤ y' â‰¤ max(ay, my)

But even this is not sufficient. For example, consider s=(0,0), m=(4,4). A point (2,3) is colinear (since the cross product is zero?), but (2,3) lies on the line y = x, but not on the segment between s and m. Wait, no: (2,3) is not colinear. Wait, (0,0) to (4,4) is the line y=x. The cross product for (2,3) would be (4-0)*(3-0) - (4-0)*(2-0) =4*3 -4*2 =12-8=4 !=0. So that's not colinear.

Hmm, maybe the approach is correct.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose s is (0,0), m is (2,2). Consider a point m' (1,1): it's on the segment, colinear. The cross product is (2-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(1-0) = 2*1 -2*1=0. So yes. Then, check that x is between 0 and 2, y between 0 and 2. So yes.

Another example: s=(0,0), m=(2,2). m' is (3,3). Then cross product is (2)*(3) - (2)*(3) =6-6=0. So colinear. Then, x is 3, which is >2. So the x is not between 0 and 2, so the point is not on the segment.

But how about m'=(1,1)? Then yes. So the approach of checking the coordinates is correct.

Therefore, the steps are:

For each s (stone), m (monster):

Check if there exists any m' (other than m) such that:

1. m' is colinear with s and m (cross product is zero).

2. m' is between s and m (x' is between ax and mx inclusive, and y' is between ay and my inclusive).

If any such m' exists, then m is not visible from s. Otherwise, m is visible.

So for each s and m, iterate through all other monsters (excluding m) and check these two conditions.

Now, in code:

We can represent each stone as a tuple (ax, ay). Each monster as a tuple (mx, my).

For each stone in stones:

   for each monster in monsters:

       visible = True

       for other_monster in monsters:

           if other_monster == monster:

               continue

           # check if other_monster is on the segment between stone and monster

           ax, ay = stone

           mx, my = monster

           ox, oy = other_monster

           # compute cross product (mx - ax)*(oy - ay) - (my - ay)*(ox - ax)

           cross = (mx - ax) * (oy - ay) - (my - ay) * (ox - ax)

           if cross != 0:

               continue

           # collinear, now check if other_monster is on the segment

           # check x and y coordinates are between ax and mx, and ay and my (including endpoints)

           if (ox < min(ax, mx)) or (ox > max(ax, mx)):

               continue

           if (oy < min(ay, my)) or (oy > max(ay, my)):

               continue

           # if here, other_monster is on the segment between stone and monster

           visible = False

           break

       if visible:

           mark monster as afraid (add to a set)

At the end, the size of the set is the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(k * n^2). For k=7 and n=1000, this is 7 * 1000 * 1000 = 7,000,000 operations, which should be manageable.

But in Python, even 7 million operations can be a bit tight. Let's see: 7e6 loops. Each iteration involves some calculations, but in Python, that's manageable. For the given constraints, 3 seconds is 3e9 operations. 7e6 is way under that.

So the code can be written as follows:

Read k and n.

Read k stones into a list.

Read n monsters into a list.

Initialize a set of afraid_monsters.

For each stone in stones:

   for each monster in monsters:

       ax, ay = stone

       mx, my = monster

       # check for other monsters on the segment between stone and monster

       blocked = False

       for other in monsters:

           if other == (mx, my):

               continue

           ox, oy = other

           # cross product

           cross = (mx - ax) * (oy - ay) - (my - ay) * (ox - ax)

           if cross != 0:

               continue

           # check if ox is between ax and mx, inclusive

           if not (min(ax, mx) <= ox <= max(ax, mx)):

               continue

           # check oy similarly

           if not (min(ay, my) <= oy <= max(ay, my)):

               continue

           # if here, other is on the segment

           blocked = True

           break

       if not blocked:

           afraid_monsters.add( (mx, my) )

The answer is the length of afraid_monsters.

Wait, but each monster is a tuple, so adding it to a set (since tuples are hashable) will avoid duplicates. But in the problem statement, the monsters are distinct (the input's k + n points are pairwise distinct). So each monster is unique.

So the code should be correct.

Testing this code against the examples:

First example input:

2 4

Stones: (-2,-1), (4,5)

Monsters: (4,2), (2,1), (4,-1), (1,-1)

For each stone and monster:

Check if any other monster is on the segment between stone and monster.

Let's take the first stone (-2,-1):

Check each monster:

Monster (4,2):

Check all other monsters (2,1), (4,-1), (1,-1).

For other = (2,1):

Check cross product:

(4 - (-2))*(1 - (-1)) - (2 - (-1))*(2 - (-2)) 

= (6)*(2) - (3)*(4) = 12 -12 =0 â†’ collinear.

Check if (2,1) is between (-2,-1) and (4,2):

x: 2 is between -2 and4 â†’ yes.

y:1 is between -1 and2 â†’ yes. So (2,1) is on the segment. So blocked. So this monster (4,2) is not visible from the first stone.

Then check the second stone (4,5) for (4,2):

Check other monsters (4,2 is the current monster. Other monsters are (2,1), (4,-1), (1,-1).

Check if any are on the segment between (4,5) and (4,2). The segment is vertical (x=4). For other monsters:

Take (4,-1): x is 4, which is same. Check y: between 5 and2 (since 5 is bigger than 2). The segment is from y=5 to y=2. (4,-1) has y=-1, which is outside. So no. Other monsters:

(2,1): x is 2, which is not 4 â†’ collinearity check fails.

(1,-1): x=1, no.

So no other monsters on the segment. So (4,2) is visible from (4,5). So this monster is added to the set.

Similarly, for each stone and monster:

Another example: monster (4,-1). Check all stones.

Take stone (4,5). The segment from (4,5) to (4,-1) is vertical. Any other monsters on this line? Check other monsters:

(4,2) is on the line. So when checking (4,-1) and stone (4,5):

Check if other monsters (4,2) is on the segment between (4,5) and (4,-1). (4,2) is between 5 and -1 in y-coordinate. So yes. So (4,-1) is blocked from stone (4,5). Check other stones.

Stone (-2,-1) to (4,-1): this is a horizontal line y=-1. The segment is from x=-2 to x=4. For other monsters:

Check if any monster is on this line. For example, (1,-1) is on the line y=-1. So for the monster (4,-1), checking stone (-2,-1):

Are there any other monsters (like (1,-1)) between (-2,-1) and (4,-1)?

(1,-1) is between x=-2 and x4, y=-1. So (1,-1) is on the segment between (-2,-1) and (4,-1). So the monster (4,-1) is blocked from this stone. Are there any other stones? No. So (4,-1) is not visible from any stone, so not counted. Which matches the first example's note.

So the code should work.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.
</think>
