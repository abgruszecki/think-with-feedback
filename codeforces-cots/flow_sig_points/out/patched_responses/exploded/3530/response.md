Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to perform k operations on the given string, where k is the floor of log2(n). Each operation i (starting from 1?) involves deleting a substring of exactly 2^i -1 characters. And the goal is to get the lexicographically smallest possible string after all these operations.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the problem statement. The i-th operation requires erasing a substring of length exactly 2^{i} - 1. Wait, the problem says "during the i-th operation you must erase some substring of length exactly 2i - 1". Wait, maybe the subscript is i, so 2^i minus 1. Because in the first example, the initial string is length 6. The number of operations k is floor(log2(6)) which is 2. So operations 1 and 2. For i=1, the length is 2^1-1=1. So first operation removes a substring of length 1. Then the second operation removes a substring of length 3. Let's see the example: input adcbca (length 6). k is floor(log2(6))=2. So first operation removes 1 character, then second removes 3. The steps in the example are adcbca → adcba (after removing the 4th character 'c') → aba (after removing the substring 'dcb' of length 3). So the total removed lengths are 1 and 3, which add up to 4. Original length 6, after removing 4, ends up with 2 characters. But wait, in each operation, the length of the substring to delete is 2^i -1. So for i=1, 2^1-1=1, i=2, 2^2-1=3. So sum of lengths is 1+3=4. Original length is 6, after two operations, 6-4=2? Wait no. Because each operation is performed on the current string. So first operation: length is 6. Remove 1, so 5. Then i=2, remove 3, leaves 5-3=2. So yes. So the output is aba, which is length 3? Wait no, the output in the example is 'aba' which is length 3. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's check the first example again. Wait the example input is adcbca (6 letters). Then after first operation, they remove a substring of length 1 (like the 'c'), resulting in adcba. Then in the second operation, they remove a substring of length 3 (like 'dcb'), resulting in aba (3 letters). Oh right, because 6 -1=5, then 5-3=2? Wait 5-3=2. But the output is 3 letters. Hmm, wait that doesn't add up. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the i-th operation refers to the index starting from 1, and the length is 2^{i} -1. So for the first example:

n=6 → log2(6) is about 2.58, so floor is 2. So k=2 operations.

Operation 1 (i=1): delete a substring of length 1 (2^1-1=1). So the string becomes length 5.

Operation 2 (i=2): delete a substring of length 3 (2^2-1=3). So the string becomes 5-3=2. But the example output is 'aba', which is 3 characters. So that suggests that maybe the i is 0-based? Or perhaps the problem statement has a different way of counting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's recheck the example.

Original input is adcbca (length 6). The first operation deletes a substring of length 1. Let's see: the original string is a d c b c a. Suppose they delete the third character 'c', then the string becomes a d b c a → which is 5 characters. Then the second operation (i=2) must delete a substring of length 3. For example, deleting 'd b c' gives a a → but that's length 2. But the example output is 'aba', which is 3 characters. Hmm. Wait the example's first step shows adcba. Oh wait, maybe after the first deletion, the string is a d c b a. Then deleting 'd c b' gives a a → but then the output would be 'aa', but the example output is 'aba'. Wait that's confusing. Let me check the example explanation again.

In the first example, after first operation, the string becomes adcba. The original input is 'adcbca' (6 letters). Removing the fourth character 'c' (index 3, 0-based?), gives 'adcba' (5 letters: a, d, c, b, a → wait no, that's 5 letters. Then the second operation removes a substring of length 3. So the string is a d c b a (5 letters). Removing 'd c b' (positions 1-3) leaves a a → which is two letters. But the example output is 'aba', which is three letters. So that can't be right. So perhaps my understanding of the problem is incorrect.

Wait maybe the problem statement says that during the i-th operation, you delete a substring of length exactly 2^{i-1} +1? Or perhaps the exponent is (i-th) operation is 2^(i) -1. Let's see the example again.

First example: 6 letters. So k= floor(log2(6)) = 2. So two operations.

In the first operation (i=1), delete a substring of length 2^1 -1 =1. Then in the second (i=2), delete 2^2-1=3. So total removed is 4. So 6-4=2 letters. But the output is 'aba', which is 3 letters. So that can't be. So maybe the exponents are i-th operation uses 2^{i} -1. Wait wait, perhaps the i starts from 0? Let's see: perhaps the first operation is i=0, which is 2^0=1, so length 1. Then i=1: 2^1=2, but 2^1-1=1. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement's k is floor(log2(n)), but the number of operations is k, and the i-th operation (starting from 1 to k) uses 2^{i} -1. Let's recalculate the example.

First example: n=6. log2(6) is ~2.58, so k=2. So i runs from 1 to 2.

First operation (i=1): delete length 1. Second (i=2): delete length 3. Total 4. So 6-4=2. But output is 3 letters. So that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait the example's first step: adcbca → adcba. So after first operation, the string is length 5. Then second operation removes 3 letters, resulting in 5-3=2. But the example's output is 'aba', which is length 3. So something's wrong here. Wait maybe the example is not following the problem's steps correctly. Let's check the note given in the problem.

In the first example's note: the steps are adcbca → adcba → aba. So first operation deletes a substring of length 1 (the 'c' at position 3?), leaving adcba (5 letters). Then the second operation deletes a substring of length 3 (like 'dcb'), leaving aba (5-3=2? No, because aba is 3 letters). Wait, that's a contradiction. Unless the substring is not contiguous. Wait, the problem says "erase some substring of length exactly...". So a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters. So when you delete a substring, the remaining parts are concatenated.

Original adcbca (6 letters). After deleting a substring of length 1 (say, the 'c' in position 2, assuming 0-based indexes), the string becomes 'adcbca' → removing index 2: 'ad bca' → adbca (5 letters). Then in the next operation, delete a substring of length 3. For example, positions 1-3 (d, b, c), leaving 'aa' → but the example's next step is adcba → aba. Wait no.

Alternatively, perhaps the first deletion is the fourth character (the 'c' in position 3) of the original string. So the original is a d c b c a (indices 0-5). Deleting index 3 (the 'b'?), wait no. Wait maybe the first step is to delete the third character (index 2) 'c' from adcbca → then the string is adbca. Then in the second operation, they delete a substring of length 3. For example, delete positions 1-3 (d, b, c) → leaves 'a a' → output 'aa', but the example's output is 'aba'.

Hmm, this suggests that maybe the problem's note is correct, but my understanding of the steps is wrong. Let's re-examine the note. The first example's steps are adcbca → adcba → aba. So after the first operation, the string becomes adcba. The original is adcbca. How? If we delete the fourth character (the 'c' in position 3?), but that's part of 'cbca' perhaps. Wait original is a d c b c a → indices 0 to 5. Deleting the 'b' (position 3) gives a d c c a → that's length 5. But the note says after first operation it's adcba. Oh wait, maybe the original is 'adcbca' which is a d c b c a. Then deleting the 'c' at position 4 (the 'c' in the fifth position) gives a d c b a → which is adcba (5 characters). Then in the next operation, delete a substring of length 3. For example, positions 1-3 (d, c, b) → leaves a a → output 'aa'. But the example's output is 'aba'.

Wait this is conflicting. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the first operation is to delete a single character (length 1), and the second is to delete a substring of length 3. But the resulting string has 6-1-3 = 2 characters. But the example's output is 'aba' which is 3 letters. So this suggests that the problem's note has a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the operations are not cumulative in the way I'm thinking. Let me re-express the example:

Original string: adcbca (6 letters).

First operation (i=1): delete a substring of length 1. Suppose the 'c' at position 3. Then the string becomes 'adcba' (5 letters: a, d, c, b, a). Then the second operation (i=2) deletes a substring of length 3. So in 'adcba', the possible substrings of length 3 are positions 0-2 (a,d,c), 1-3 (d,c,b), or 2-4 (c,b,a). Deleting the substring 1-3 (d,c,b) leaves 'aa' → which is length 2. But the example's output is 'aba', which is 3 letters. So this contradicts. So perhaps the problem's note is correct, but my reasoning is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the first operation is not the first step. Wait, in the example's note, the steps are:

adcbca → adcba (after first operation) → aba (after second). So in the first step, they delete a substring of length 1 (the 'c' at position 3?), resulting in adcba (5 letters). Then in the second operation, they delete a substring of length 3. So, in adcba (length 5), deleting a substring of length 3 leaves 5-3=2 letters. But the output is aba, which is 3 letters. So this is impossible.

Wait this is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem statement's note is wrong, but that's unlikely. So there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the operations are applied in reverse. Or perhaps the i-th operation uses 2^{i} -1, but the operations are ordered in such a way that the sum is larger than the initial length. That can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the number of operations is floor(log2(n)), but the sum of the lengths is n - m, where m is the final length. So for the first example, the sum is 1 +3=4. Original length is 6. So 6-4=2. But the output is 3 letters, which is impossible. So there's a fundamental misunderstanding here.

Wait perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me read the problem statement again.

The problem says: perform k operations, where k is floor(log2(n)). Each i-th operation must erase a substring of exactly 2^i -1. So the first operation (i=1) deletes 2^1-1 =1 character. Second (i=2) deletes 3, etc. The sum of these lengths must be the total deleted.

In the first example, n=6, so k=2. So sum is 1+3=4. So the final length is 6-4=2. But the example's output is 'aba', which is 3 letters. So this is impossible. Therefore, my understanding of the problem is incorrect.

Wait the example's first input is adcbca (length 6). The output is 'aba' (3 letters). So 6-3=3 characters were deleted. So sum of the operations' lengths must be 3. But according to the problem statement, the sum is 1+3=4, which is more than 3. So this suggests that perhaps the i-th operation uses 2^{i-1} as the exponent. Let's see:

For the first example, k=2. So i runs from 1 to 2.

i=1: 2^{0} =1, minus 1 → 0. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the operation is (2^{i} -1). So for i=1, 2^1-1=1, i=2, 2^2-1=3. Sum 4. But 6-4=2. So again, the example's output is 3 letters. So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem with my understanding of the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of operations k is floor(log2(n)) +1. Let's compute for n=6: log2(6) is approx 2.58, floor is 2. So 2 operations, but the sum is 1+3=4. So 6-4=2. But the example's output is 3 letters. So this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way the operations are applied. Let's look at the first example's note: the steps are adcbca → adcba → aba. The first operation deletes a substring of length 1 (from adcbca to adcba). The original string is 6 letters. After deleting one character, it's 5. Then the next step deletes 3 characters, leaving 5-3=2. But the result is 'aba' which is 3 letters. So this is impossible. Therefore, my only conclusion is that the problem's note is not matching the problem statement, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement allows the same operation to be applied multiple times. But according to the note, in the first example, two operations are applied. So perhaps the sum is 1+3=4, but the output is 2 letters. But the example's output is 3. So this is confusing.

Wait perhaps the problem's note is wrong. Let me check the first example again. Input adcbca. The output is aba. The steps are: delete 1 character (length 1) and then delete 3 characters (length 3). So total deleted 4. Original length 6-4=2. But the output is 3 letters. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps the problem's note is a typo. For example, maybe the first operation deletes a substring of length 2 and the second of length 2. Then sum is 4, but that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's i-th operation uses 2^{i} as the length. So i=1: 2^1=2, i=2: 2^2=4. Sum 6. So 6-6=0. That's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note is correct and the problem statement has a different formula. For example, the length in the i-th operation is 2^{i} -1, but the operations are done in reverse order. For example, for k=2, the first operation is i=2 (length 3), then i=1 (length 1). Then sum is 3+1=4. So same result.

But even then, the output in the example would be 2 characters. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's k is the number of operations, and each operation's length is 2^{k - i +1} -1, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note is correct, and the actual i-th operation's length is 2^{i} -1, but the initial k is computed as floor(log2(n)), but the sum of the lengths is allowed to be more than the initial length. But that's impossible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the k is floor(log2(n)) +1. Let's compute for n=6: log2(6) is ~2.58, floor is 2. So +1 would be 3 operations. Then the sum is 1+3+7=11, which is way more than 6. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note is wrong, and the actual output for the first example is 'aa', but the sample shows 'aba'. That can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's formula for k is different. Maybe k is the maximum number of operations such that the sum of the lengths of the deletions is ≤n-1, and each operation i deletes 2^{i} -1. For example, for n=6, possible operations:

i=1: delete 1 → sum 1. Remaining length 5.

i=2: delete 3 → sum 4. Remaining length 6-4=2. Which would require two operations. But output is 'aba' (3 letters). So this is impossible.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement's example, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me try to approach this differently. Let's focus on solving the problem.

The problem requires us to perform k operations where k is floor(log2(n)). For each i-th operation (i ranges from 1 to k), the length of the substring to delete is exactly 2^i - 1. The goal is to choose the deletions in a way that the final string is lex smallest.

So, for example, the first example's n is 6. log2(6) is 2.58 → floor is 2. So two operations. The first is delete 1 character, second delete 3. The sum is 4. So the final string has 6-4=2 characters. But the example's output is 'aba' which is 3 characters. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem's i-th operation is 2^{i} -1. But the sum of the lengths for k operations is 2^{k+1} -k -2. Wait for k=1, sum is 1. For k=2, 1+3=4. For k=3, 1+3+7=11. So the sum is 2^{k+1} -k-2. But for n=6, k=2, sum 4. So 6-4=2. But the example's output is 3. So this is impossible.

This suggests that the problem's note is incorrect. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the problem's formula for the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1} + 1. For example, for i=1: 1+1=2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula is 2^{i} -1, but the operations can be applied in any order, but that's not the case since each operation is i-th in order. So i is sequential from 1 to k.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's note has a typo, but the actual steps are as follows:

First example:

Original: adcbca (6 letters). After first operation (length 1), the string becomes adcba (5 letters). Then, second operation (length 3) deletes 'dcb', leaving 'a a', which is 'aa'. But the example's output is 'aba'. So this is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first operation deletes a substring of length 3 and the second of length 1. But according to the problem statement, the i-th operation must be length 2^i-1. So for k=2, the first operation is i=1 (length 1), then i=2 (length 3). So the order is fixed.

Therefore, there's a discrepancy here, which suggests that perhaps the problem's note is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the operations can be performed in any order. But the problem states that during the i-th operation, you delete a substring of exactly 2^i-1. So i starts from 1 to k. So first delete 1, then 3, etc.

But this leads to a problem in the example. So perhaps the problem's note is wrong, but that's not possible. So I must find a different approach to understand.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of operations k is floor(log2(n)), but the sum of the lengths is 2^{k} -1. For example, for k=2, sum 3. Which would fit for n=6: 6-3=3 (the example's output is 3 letters). So perhaps the length of the i-th operation is 2^{i} -1, but the sum of the first k terms. Wait, but the sum of the first k terms of 2^i -1 for i from 1 to k is sum(2^i) -k → sum(2^i) is 2^{k+1}-2 → so sum is 2^{k+1} -2 -k. For k=2, sum is (8-2) -2=4. So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula is floor(log2(n)) +1. For n=6, log2(6) is 2.58 → floor is 2 → +1=3. Then sum 1+3+7=11. Which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the length is 2^{i-1}. So for i=1, length 1. i=2, length 2. i=3, length 4. Sum 1+2+4=7. So for n=7, that's correct. But for n=6, k= floor(log2(6))=2. Sum 1+2=3. 6-3=3 letters. Which matches the example. So first example's output is 3 letters. So perhaps the formula is 2^{i-1} for the i-th operation. Let's check.

Wait for the first example, k=2. Then the sum of lengths is 1+2=3. So 6-3=3 letters, which matches the output. Then the first operation is to delete a substring of length 1, and the second of length 2. So the steps would be:

Original: adcbca (6). Delete 1 character (e.g., 'd'), becomes acbca (5). Then delete 2 characters (e.g., 'cb'), becomes a ca (3 letters: 'aca'). But the example's output is 'aba'. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the first deletion is of length 2. But the problem statement's formula may have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1} +1. For i=1: 1+1=2. i=2: 2+1=3. So sum for k=2 would be 2+3=5. 6-5=1. Which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula is 2^{i} -1, but the number of operations k is such that 2^{k+1} -1 <=n. For example, n=6: 2^{3} -1=7>6. So k=2. So sum 1+3=4. 6-4=2. But example's output is 3 letters. So again conflicting.

At this point, I'm stuck. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem statement is correct, and I'm missing something. Let's try to proceed.

The problem is to find the lex smallest possible string after k operations. Each operation i deletes a substring of exactly 2^i-1 length. The key is to model the deletions in such a way that after each step, the remaining string is as lex smallest as possible.

But how to model this? Since each operation's deletion depends on the previous steps, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. However, given that n can be up to 5000, and each step can involve choosing a substring of certain length to delete, the naive approach is not feasible.

Let me think. For each operation, we need to delete a substring of a certain length. The optimal choice is to choose the substring whose deletion leaves the lex smallest possible string. So for each step, we need to find the minimal possible string by considering all possible deletions of the required length.

But the problem is that the number of possible deletions is O(n) per operation. For example, in the first operation, there are O(n) possible positions to delete a substring of length 1 (since each single character is a possible substring). For each of these choices, the remaining string is processed in the next step.

But with k up to log2(n) (floor), which for n=5000 is about 12 (since 2^12=4096, 2^13=8192 → log2(5000)=~12.28, floor is 12). So 12 operations. For each operation, the number of possibilities could be O(n) for each step. But 5000^12 is way beyond feasible.

Therefore, a brute-force approach is impossible. So we need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Since the deletions are done in steps, and each step's deletion is dependent on the previous steps, perhaps we can model the possible intervals to delete in each step, and track the best possible string at each step.

But even that would be difficult. Instead, perhaps we can model the problem as a series of greedy choices. At each step, choose the deletion that gives the lex smallest possible string, then proceed.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Let's think for each operation. For the current string, we need to find the best possible substring of length L=2^i-1 to delete, such that the resulting string is lex smallest.

The key is that, for a given string and a deletion length L, the optimal choice is to find the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible substring. For example, among all possible substrings of length L, find the one that, when removed, leaves the smallest possible string.

But how to compute this. For example, given a string S and length L, the best way to delete a substring of length L is to find the position where the substring is the lex largest possible, so that deleting it leaves the lex smallest string. Wait, no. Deleting a substring of length L will result in the remaining parts being concatenated. To find the lex smallest possible string after deletion, the best approach is to find the leftmost occurrence of the smallest possible window of length L. Wait, no. Because the deletion of a substring may affect the entire structure of the string.

Alternatively, the lex smallest string after deletion is obtained by choosing the earliest possible occurrence of a substring that, when removed, the remaining parts form the lex smallest possible string.

For example, consider the string 'abc'. If we delete a substring of length 1, the possible deletions are a, b, or c. The resulting strings are 'bc', 'ac', 'ab'. The lex smallest is 'ab' (deleting 'c').

So, in this case, we would choose to delete the third character.

But in general, for a given current string S, and a required deletion length L, we need to find all possible substrings of length L, delete each, and select the lex smallest resulting string.

The problem is to compute this efficiently.

But for each operation, the current string can be up to O(n) length, and for each possible deletion (O(n) possibilities), we need to compute the new string. For n=5000, and 12 operations, this would be O(n^2 * log n), which for n=5000 is 5000*5000*12=3e8 operations, which might be manageable.

Wait, but for each operation, the string's length decreases. For example, first operation: length is up to 5000. Second: 5000- (2^1-1) = 4999, but next operation deletes 3, so 4999-3=4996, etc. But in the worst case, the sum of the deletions is up to 2^12 -1, but perhaps for n=5000, the initial k is 12. So the sum is 1+3+7+15+31+63+127+255+511+1023+2047+4095= sum from i=1 to 12 of (2^i -1) = sum(2^i) -12 → sum(2^1 to 2^12) is 2^13 -2 → 8192-2=8190. So sum is 8190-12=8178. For n=5000, 5000-8178 would be negative, which is impossible. So the actual k for n=5000 is the maximum possible such that the sum of the deletions is <=n-1.

Wait, no. Because the problem states that k is floor(log2(n)). So for n=5000, log2(5000) is about 12.28, so floor is 12. So k=12. But sum of (2^1-1) + ... + (2^12 -1) is sum(2^1 to 2^12) -12. Sum(2^1 to 2^12) = 2^13 -2 =8190. So 8190 -12= 8178. For n=5000, 5000 -8178 would be negative. So this is impossible. Therefore, my previous understanding must be wrong.

This suggests that the problem statement's formula for k is different. Perhaps the k is the maximum number of operations such that the sum of (2^i -1) for i from 1 to k is <=n-1. For example, for n=6, the sum for k=2 is 1+3=4. 6-4=2≥1. So allowed. For k=3, sum 1+3+7=11, which would require n=12. So for n=6, k=2. So the formula for k is the largest integer where sum_{i=1}^k (2^i -1) ≤n-1.

But how to compute that. For example, sum_{i=1}^k (2^i-1) = sum(2^i) - sum(1) → sum(2^1 to 2^k) = 2^{k+1}-2. So sum_{i=1}^k (2^i-1) = 2^{k+1} -2 -k.

We need this sum to be ≤n-1. So 2^{k+1} -k -2 ≤n-1 → 2^{k+1} ≤n +k +1 -1 → 2^{k+1} ≤n +k.

Wait, but solving for k is not straightforward. For example, for n=6:

We need 2^{k+1} -k-2 ≤5.

Check k=2: 2^3 -2-2=8-4=4 ≤5 → yes.

k=3: 2^4 -3-2=16-5=11>5 → no. So k=2. Which matches the example.

So the correct formula for k is the maximum k where 2^{k+1} -k-2 ≤n-1.

But how to compute k for a given n? It's not straightforward. However, the problem statement says that k is floor(log2(n)). So perhaps the problem statement's formula for k is correct, but in practice, the sum may exceed n-1, making it impossible. But the problem statement's examples show that it is possible, so perhaps the formula for k is correct, and the sum of the lengths of the deletions is exactly n - m, where m is the final length. But how to reconcile this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows the sum of the deletions to be larger than n, which is impossible. So there must be a misunderstanding.

But perhaps the problem statement's formula for k is floor(log2(n)), regardless of whether the sum of the deletions is possible. However, for some n, the sum of the deletions would be larger than n, making it impossible. But the problem's examples must be possible, so the formula must be correct.

This suggests that the problem's note is incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's k is computed as the largest possible such that the sum of the deletions is <=n-1. Then the formula for k is the largest integer where sum_{i=1}^k (2^i-1) <=n-1.

So, for n=6:

sum_{i=1}^2} 1+3=4 ≤5 (since n=6, 6-1=5). sum for k=3 is 11>5. So k=2. Which matches the problem's example.

In this case, the sum of the deletions is 4, and the final length is 6-4=2. But the example's output is 3 letters. So there's a contradiction.

Thus, this suggests that my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect, and perhaps the problem's formula for the i-th operation's length is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula for the i-th operation's length is 2^{i} -1, but the number of operations k is the largest integer such that the sum of the lengths is <=n -1. For example, in the first example, sum is 4. 4 <=5. So allowed. The final string is 6-4=2. But the example's output is 3 letters. So again, this is a contradiction.

At this point, I think I must proceed to find a solution that matches the examples, regardless of the initial confusion.

Looking at the first example's note: the first operation deletes a single character (length 1), and the second deletes a substring of length 3. The sum is 4. The final string is 'aba' (3 letters). So this is impossible unless the sum is 3. So perhaps the problem's formula for the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1}. For example, first operation: 2^0=1, second 2^1=2. Sum is 3. So for n=6, 6-3=3, which matches the example.

So the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1}. Then for the first example, k=2. Sum 1+2=3. Final length 3. Which matches.

But how does this fit with the problem statement's description?

The problem statement says: during the i-th operation, erase some substring of length exactly 2i-1. So if i-th operation's length is 2i-1, then for i=1: 2*1-1=1. i=2: 3. sum 1+3=4. So again, for n=6, final length 2. But the example's output is 3 letters. So this still doesn't fit.

Therefore, the only way the example's output is possible is if the sum of the deletions is 3. Which would mean that the problem's formula for the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1}.

Assuming that, then for n=6, k is floor(log2(n))=2. So sum 1+2=3. Final length 3. Which matches the example. Then, the problem statement's note has a typo. So perhaps the problem statement's actual formula is that during the i-th operation, the length is 2^{i-1}. Then, the first operation (i=1) is 1, second (i=2) is 2, etc.

But the problem statement's description says the i-th operation's length is exactly 2i-1. So perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement. This seems likely, given the example.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's formula is 2^{i} -1, but the example's note is wrong. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's example is correct, but the formula for the i-th operation's length is different. For example, the i-th operation's length is 2^{i-1} +1. For i=1, 1+1=2. i=2: 2+1=3. Sum 2+3=5. For n=6, 6-5=1. But example's output is 3 letters.

This is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the example.

In the first example's note, after two operations:

Original: adcbca → after first operation (deleting length 1) becomes adcba. Then deleting length 3 gives aba.

So sum of deletions is 1+3=4. Original length is 6. 6-4=2. But the result is 3 letters. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the example's note. Or perhaps the problem statement's formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula is that the i-th operation's length is 2^{i} -1, but the operations are 0-based. For example, k= floor(log2(n)), and the operations are 0-based from 0 to k-1. Then, for i=0, the length is 2^0 -1 =0, which is invalid. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 2^{i} +1, but for i=1, that's 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's formula is 2^{i} -1, but the i starts from 0. For example, k= floor(log2(n)). The i-th operation (0-based) uses 2^{i} -1. For example, for n=6, log2(6)=~2.58, floor is 2. So k=2. The operations are i=0 and i=1. Then lengths are 1 and 3. Sum 4. Again, same problem.

At this point, I'm stuck. The only way forward is to look for a solution that can pass the examples, assuming that the problem's note is correct.

In the first example, after deleting a substring of length 1 and then of length 3, the result is 'aba' of length 3. So the sum of deletions is 3. Thus, the sum of the operations' lengths must be 3. So the lengths must be 2 and 1. Or the operations are 3 and 0 (invalid). So perhaps the problem's formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's formula is that the i-th operation's length is 2^{k-i} -1. For example, if k=2, the first operation's length is 2^1-1=1, and the second is 2^0-1=0. Which is invalid. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is that the sum of the lengths is n - m, where m is the final length. So for the first example, sum is 3. So n=6, m=3. Sum is 3. So the operations' lengths could be 1 and 2 (sum 3). For example, first delete 1 character, then delete 2. Sum 3. 6-3=3. Which matches.

So, perhaps the problem statement's formula is that the i-th operation's length is 2^{i} -1, but the number of operations k is such that the sum of the lengths is exactly n -m, and m is the final length. But how to determine k.

But this is unclear. Given the time constraints, perhaps the way forward is to find a solution that works for the examples, regardless of the formula.

The key observation is that after each operation, the string is modified by deleting a substring of certain length. The goal is to choose these deletions in such a way that the lex smallest possible string is obtained.

So, the approach is:

For each step from 1 to k (k is floor(log2(n))), determine the current string, and then find the best possible substring of length L=2^i-1 to delete, resulting in the lex smallest string.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The key challenge is to compute, for a given string and length L, the best possible substring to delete.

An efficient way to find the best deletion for a given string and L is to find all possible substrings of length L, and select the one whose deletion results in the lex smallest string.

But comparing all possible deletions is O(n) for each step, which for n=5000 and k=12 is manageable, as each step is O(n^2) (for each possible deletion, create a new string and compare lex order).

But this would be O(k * n^2), which for n=5000 is 12 * 5000 * 5000 = 3e8 operations. Which might be tight for Python's time limit.

Alternative idea: For each possible deletion, the resulting string can be represented as the concatenation of the part before the substring and the part after. The lex smallest string is the one where the concatenated parts form the smallest possible sequence.

But comparing all possible deletions directly would be O(n^2) per operation, which is not feasible for large n.

Thus, we need a more efficient way to find the best deletion.

The key insight is that the optimal deletion for a given L is the one where the remaining string (after deletion) is lex smallest. This can be found by finding the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible window.

But how?

Alternatively, the optimal deletion is the one that removes a substring such that the remaining string is lex smallest. For example, when you delete a substring, you're left with the prefix and suffix. So the minimal possible string is the one where the prefix is as small as possible, and the suffix is as small as possible.

So for each possible start index i of the substring of length L, the resulting string is s[0..i-1] + s[i+L..n-1]. We need to find the i that minimizes this concatenation.

The problem reduces to finding the i that minimizes s[0..i-1] + s[i+L..n-1].

This is equivalent to finding the i where the combined string is lex smallest.

To find this efficiently, we can compare all possible i's in O(n) time per L.

But how?

For example, given L, the possible positions i are from 0 to len(s) - L. For each i, the candidate string is s[:i] + s[i+L:]. We need to find the i that gives the lex smallest such string.

This can be done by comparing the candidates in pairs and selecting the minimal one.

But comparing two candidates is O(n) time, and doing this for all candidates is O(n^2) time. Which is not feasible for large n.

Alternative idea: We can model the problem as follows. The optimal i is the one where the concatenated string is lex smallest. The concatenated string can be compared lex order by comparing the first position where the two candidates differ.

To find the minimal candidate, we can iterate through all possible i and keep track of the best i found so far.

The key is to compare the current best candidate with the new candidate, and update the best if the new one is better.

This can be done in O(n) time per L by finding the minimal i using a sliding window approach.

But how?

Another approach: the best i is the one where the first occurrence of the minimal possible prefix is found. For example, for each possible i, the minimal candidate is the one where the prefix s[:i] is as small as possible, and the suffix s[i+L:] is as small as possible.

But this is a two-part comparison. It's possible that a longer prefix in the first part can lead to a better lex order.

Let's think of two candidates i and j. How to compare their concatenated strings.

Compare the two strings character by character:

The concatenated string for i is s[:i] + s[i+L:].

For j, it's s[:j] + s[j+L:].

To compare these, we can proceed as follows:

Compare the characters of both concatenated strings up to the minimum of their lengths. The first differing character determines the order.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, note that the concatenated string for i is the original string with the substring from i to i+L-1 removed. So the concatenated string can be viewed as a new string formed by two parts: the prefix up to i-1, and the suffix starting at i+L.

The minimal concatenated string is the one where:

- The prefix up to i-1 is as small as possible. If two prefixes are the same up to i-1, then the suffix starting at i+L must be as small as possible.

So the optimal i is the leftmost position where the prefix is lex smallest possible, and the suffix is also lex smallest possible.

But how to find this efficiently.

An efficient way to find the minimal i for a given L is as follows:

We can precompute for each possible i the concatenated string, but this is not feasible for large L.

Alternative idea: the minimal candidate is the one that is lex smallest when compared to all others. We can find this by iterating through all possible i and keeping track of the best i.

For example:

Initialize best_i = 0.

For each i in 0 to len(s) - L:

   Compare the concatenated string for i and best_i.

   If the concatenated string for i is smaller, update best_i to i.

The key is to compare the two concatenated strings efficiently.

But comparing the entire strings is O(n) per comparison, which is O(n^2) time.

To optimize this, we can compare the two concatenated strings incrementally and break at the first differing character.

But in the worst case, this is still O(n) per i.

But with the following optimization: for each candidate i, the concatenated string is s[:i] + s[i+L:]. The length of the concatenated string is len(s) - L.

For two candidates i and j, the concatenated strings differ in two regions:

1. The prefix up to i-1 and j-1.

2. The suffix from i+L and j+L.

But comparing these two strings can be done by comparing the original string, taking into account the deleted regions.

For example, when comparing i and j:

We can compare the original string character by character, but skipping the deleted regions.

But this requires checking whether the current position is in the deleted region for either candidate.

Alternatively, for positions k in 0 to len(s) - L - 1:

The character in the concatenated string for i is s[k] if k < i, or s[k + L] if k >= i.

Similarly for j.

Thus, comparing the two concatenated strings can be done by iterating through all possible positions and finding the first position where the two differ.

But this seems complex.

Another approach is to note that the minimal i is the one where the concatenated string is the lex smallest. To find this, we can model it as follows:

The concatenated string is the original string with a window of length L removed. The minimal such string is the one where the window is such that the remaining parts are lex smallest.

This can be considered as finding the minimal string that is a subsequence of the original string, with exactly a window of length L removed.

But this is not a subsequence but a specific deletion of a window.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the window of length L whose deletion results in the lex smallest possible string.

To find this efficiently, we can iterate through all possible windows and select the minimal one.

But comparing all possible windows is O(n) per step, which for n=5000 and k=12 is O(6e4) steps. But each step involves comparing O(n) possible windows, each requiring O(n) time for comparison. Which would be O(n^2) time, which is 25e6 operations for n=5e3. But for Python, this might be too slow.

Alternative idea: find the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible window.

For example, the minimal concatenated string is obtained by choosing the earliest window where the characters are the largest possible, thus their deletion leaves the minimal string.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, deleting a window that contains a large character early might be better.

Alternatively, the minimal string after deletion is the one that starts with the smallest possible character. So, for the concatenated string, the first character is the first character of the original string, unless the deleted window includes the first character.

So, the optimal deletion window is the one that allows the earliest possible occurrence of the smallest possible first character.

But this is not sufficient. For example, if after deletion, the first character is 'a', but the rest of the string is worse.

But perhaps the minimal concatenated string can be found by finding the earliest possible window that allows the earliest possible occurrence of the minimal possible characters in the resulting string.

But this requires a way to compare the candidates efficiently.

An alternative approach is to precompute the best possible window for each L in O(n) time.

Let me think of the concatenated string as s' = s[:i] + s[i+L:].

The first character of s' is s[0] if i > 0, else s[L].

Similarly, the second character depends on whether the index is in the window.

To find the minimal s', we can compare the candidates i and j by their s':

- Find the first position where s' differs between i and j. The candidate with the smaller character at that position is better.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This seems similar to the problem of comparing two suffixes of a string, which can be done with a suffix array. However, here we need to compare two prefixes and suffixes.

But perhaps we can precompute certain information to make this comparison faster.

Another idea: for a given L, the minimal s' is the one where the earliest possible occurrence of the minimal possible character in the original string is not part of the deleted window. However, this is not necessarily true, but it can be a heuristic.

Alternatively, the best window to delete is the one where the window is the lex largest possible substring of length L. Deleting this window would leave the lex smallest possible string.

This is possible because deleting a larger substring would remove larger characters, leading to a smaller string.

For example, if the window contains a 'z', deleting it would help.

But this may not hold in all cases.

But perhaps the approach is to find the lex largest window of length L and delete it. This may not work for all cases, but perhaps it's a way to proceed.

For example, in the first example's first operation (L=1), the window is a single character. The largest character in the string is 'd' (in 'adcbca'). Deleting 'd' leaves 'acbca' → which is 'acbca' → but the example's first step deletes 'c' (position 3 in the original string) to get 'adcba'.

Wait, but 'adcba' is lex smaller than 'acbca'. So deleting 'c' (position 3) gives a better result than deleting 'd' (position 1). So this approach of deleting the lex largest window is not correct.

Therefore, this suggests that the approach must be to find the deletion that results in the lex smallest concatenated string.

Thus, the only way is to compare all possible candidates.

But this is O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for large n.

So, the question is: can we find an efficient way to find the best i for each L?

Let me think of the problem as follows. For a given L, the concatenated string s' = s[:i] + s[i+L:] can be viewed as the original string with a window from i to i+L-1 removed.

We need to find the i that minimizes s'.

The problem reduces to finding the i where s' is lex smallest.

To find this i, we can compare the candidates i and j as follows:

Compare the characters of s' for i and j until a difference is found.

But doing this for all pairs of i and j is O(n^2) time.

But perhaps there is a way to find the best i by finding the earliest occurrence where the concatenated string is minimal.

For example, for each possible i, compare s' for i with the current best candidate. Update the best candidate whenever s' for i is smaller.

The question is, how to compare s' for i and best_i efficiently.

One way to compare two candidates i and j is to find the first position where their concatenated strings differ. This can be done by comparing the characters in the original string, skipping the deleted regions.

For example, let’s consider comparing i and j, where i < j.

The concatenated string for i is s[:i] + s[i+L:].

The concatenated string for j is s[:j] + s[j+L:].

The positions where these two strings differ are:

- For positions before i: same for both.

- For positions between i and j-1 (in i's concatenated string, these are s[i+L], s[i+L+1], etc., while in j's concatenated string, these are s[i], s[i+1], ..., s[j-1].

- For positions between j and i+L-1: in i's concatenated string, these are s[j], s[j+1], ..., s[i+L-1], while in j's concatenated string, these are skipped.

- For positions after j+L: same for both.

This seems complicated.

Alternative approach: model the concatenated string as follows.

For a candidate i, the concatenated string is s' = s[:i] + s[i+L:].

To compare s' for i and j, we can iterate through each position of s' and compare.

But this is O(n) per comparison, which is O(n^2) time for all candidates.

But for n=5000 and k=12, this is 5000*12=6e4 steps, each involving O(n) comparisons. For 6e4 * 5e3 = 3e8 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: find the best candidate i in O(n) time per L.

To do this, we can find the i where the concatenated string s' is lex smallest.

This can be done by iterating through all possible i and keeping track of the best candidate so far.

To compare the current candidate i with the best candidate so far, we can find the first position where the two concatenated strings differ.

The key is to find this first differing position efficiently.

But how?

Let me think of the two concatenated strings as s1 and s2.

s1 is the original string with window i1 of length L removed.

s2 is the original string with window i2 of length L removed.

We need to compare s1 and s2.

The first difference between s1 and s2 can occur in one of the following regions:

1. Before the start of both windows.

2. In the prefix part (before i1's window) but after i2's window.

3. In the suffix part (after i1's window) but before i2's window.

4. After both windows.

But this is complex.

Alternatively, think of the concatenated strings s1 and s2 as follows:

s1 is the string with the interval [i1, i1+L-1] removed.

s2 is the string with the interval [i2, i2+L-1] removed.

The first differing position between s1 and s2 is the first position k where s1's k-th character is not equal to s2's k-th character.

To find this efficiently, we can note that the concatenated strings are made by joining the parts of the original string before and after the deleted window.

Thus, for any position k in s1 or s2:

- If k < min(i1, i2), then s1[k] and s2[k] are both s[k].

- If i1 < i2:

   - For k < i1: same.

   - For i1 <=k < i2 - L: s1[k] = s[k + L], s2[k] = s[k].

   - For i2 - L <=k < i2: s1[k] = s[k + L], s2[k] = s[k].

   - For i2 <=k < i1 + L: s1[k] = s[k + L], s2[k] = s[k + L] (since their windows overlap? Not sure.)

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps a smarter way is to realize that the concatenated string for i is the same as the original string except for the deleted window. So, for comparing two candidates i and j, the first position where they differ is either:

- In the original string, before both windows.

- In the original string, in the window of one candidate but not the other.

- After both windows.

Thus, to compare two candidates i and j, we can find the first position in the original string where they differ, taking into account the deleted windows.

But this is still tricky.

Alternative idea: find the earliest position where the two candidates differ.

For example, compare the characters of the original string in order, but skipping the deleted window for each candidate.

We can model this with two pointers, one for each candidate's concatenated string.

For each candidate, the concatenated string is formed by the characters before the window and after the window.

Thus, for candidate i, the concatenated string is:

prefix_i = s[0..i-1]

suffix_i = s[i+L..n-1]

So, the concatenated string is prefix_i + suffix_i.

For candidate j, it's prefix_j + suffix_j.

To compare these two strings, we can compare them character by character.

The first position where they differ determines which is lex smaller.

But comparing them character by character is O(n) time per pair.

But since we need to compare all i to find the best candidate, this approach is O(n^2) time per operation.

This is not feasible for n=5000.

Thus, we need a better approach.

Alternative approach:

For a given L, the optimal window to delete is the one that creates the lex smallest possible string. To find this window, we can find the earliest window where the first differing character in the concatenated string is as small as possible.

This seems vague. Perhaps we can find the best window by comparing the concatenated strings in a way that allows us to determine the best i without explicitly comparing all possible i.

Another idea: the best window is the one where the concatenated string starts with the smallest possible character. Among all such windows, we choose the one where the next character is smallest, and so on.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, the minimal concatenated string is the minimal possible suffix of the original string after deleting a window of length L.

This can be modeled as follows: for each possible i, the concatenated string is a combination of the prefix and suffix. To find the minimal such string, we can find the minimal combination.

But the challenge is to find this efficiently.

A possible solution is to realize that the minimal concatenated string is the minimal between all possible i of the string formed by s[0..i-1] + s[i+L..n-1].

To compare two candidates i and j, the minimal of these two can be determined by comparing their strings as follows:

- Find the first position where the two strings differ.

This can be done by iterating through the characters of both strings and comparing them. The first differing character determines which is smaller.

But again, this is O(n) per comparison.

But what if we can precompute for each possible i the positions where the characters are different?

This seems difficult.

Alternative idea: the minimal concatenated string is the one that, when the windows are removed, leaves the lex smallest possible string. To find this, we can find the leftmost window where the original string after removing the window is lex smallest.

But how to find this leftmost window.

This is similar to finding the minimal string after removing one character. For example, to find the lex smallest string after deleting one character, you iterate through each possible character and find the earliest occurrence where deleting it gives the minimal string.

But in this case, the window is of length L, which can vary.

But for a fixed L, the same approach can be used: iterate through each possible i from 0 to len(s) - L, and for each i, compute the concatenated string, keeping track of the minimal one.

But this approach is O(n^2) time for each operation, which is feasible for n=5000 and k=12? Let's calculate:

For n=5000, each operation has O(n) possible i. For each i, the concatenated string is of length n - L, which is up to 5000. Comparing two strings of this length takes O(n) time. So for each operation, the time is O(n^2). For 12 operations, it's 12 * 5000^2 = 3e8 operations. In Python, this is probably too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: for each possible i, the concatenated string's first differing character with the current best candidate can be found quickly.

For example, for the current best candidate i_best and a new candidate i, we can find the first position where s'[i_best] and s'[i] differ.

If we can find this first differing position in O(1) time, then comparing two candidates would take O(1) time, and the total time per L would be O(n).

But how?

This requires preprocessing the string to allow quick comparisons between any two candidates.

This seems like a job for a suffix array or a segment tree, but I'm not sure.

Another approach is to realize that the concatenated string for i can be viewed as the original string with a gap of L characters starting at i. The minimal such string would be the one where the earliest possible character in the concatenated string is as small as possible.

So, for each possible i, the first character of the concatenated string is s[0] if i>0, or s[L] if i=0.

Similarly, the second character is s[1] if i>1, or s[L] if i=1, etc.

Thus, for each i, the first character of the concatenated string is s[0] if i>0, else s[L]. The second character is s[1] if i>1, else s[L+1] if i=0, etc.

Thus, the first character of the concatenated string for i is s[0] if i >0, and s[L] if i=0.

So to find the minimal concatenated string, we can first compare the first character of all possible i. The minimal first character is preferred.

If multiple i's have the same first character, we compare the second character, and so on.

Thus, the best i is the one that gives the earliest occurrence of the smallest possible first character, then second, etc.

But how to find this.

For the first character:

- For all i where the concatenated string's first character is s[0], we must have i >0. Otherwise, for i=0, the first character is s[L].

So, the minimal possible first character is the minimal between s[0] and s[L], s[L+1], ... up to s[ len(s) - L ].

Wait, no. For i=0, the first character is s[L]. For i=1, the first character is s[0]. For i=2, the first character is s[0]. For i>0, the first character is s[0].

So, the first character of the concatenated string is s[0] for all i >0, and s[L] for i=0.

Thus, the minimal first character is the minimum between s[0] and s[L].

If s[0] is smaller than s[L], then all i>0 will give a first character of s[0], which is better than i=0's s[L]. So the best candidates are all i>0.

If s[L] is smaller than s[0], then i=0 is the best candidate.

If they are equal, then we need to look at the second character.

Thus, this gives a way to filter out candidates.

For example, in the first step:

Compare s[0] and s[L].

If s[0] is smaller, then the best candidate is among i>0. For these i>0, the first character is s[0]. So we need to compare the second character.

The second character for i>0 is s[1] if i>1, else s[L+1] (when i=1).

So, for i>0, the second character is s[1] if i>1, else s[L+1] (for i=1).

Thus, the minimal second character among i>0 is the minimum between s[1] and s[L+1], s[L+2], etc.

But this seems complicated.

But this approach can be generalized. For each position in the concatenated string, we can determine the minimal possible character, and filter out candidates that do not achieve this.

This is similar to the way we find the minimal string by greedily choosing the earliest occurrence of the minimal character at each step.

Thus, the algorithm would proceed as follows:

For a given L, determine the best i by greedily choosing the earliest position where each subsequent character is minimized.

But how to implement this.

For example:

We start by considering all possible i.

For the first character of the concatenated string, find the minimal possible character. All i that do not have this character in the first position are discarded.

Among the remaining candidates, look at the second character of the concatenated string, find the minimal possible character. Discard candidates that do not have this character in the second position.

Repeat until a single candidate remains.

This is a greedy approach and can be implemented efficiently.

The key is to find, for each step, the minimal possible character at position k among the remaining candidates, and filter out candidates that do not have this character at k.

This approach can be implemented in O(n^2) time, but perhaps there's a way to optimize it.

Alternatively, this approach can be implemented using pointers and range queries.

For example, for each position k in the concatenated string:

- Determine the minimal character among all remaining candidates at position k.

- For each candidate i in the remaining set, determine what the character is at position k of their concatenated string.

- Keep only those candidates i where the character at position k is equal to the minimal.

This can be done by maintaining a list of candidate indices and for each step, updating them based on the minimal character.

But for large n and L, this could still be O(n^2) time in the worst case.

But perhaps, in practice, this approach is manageable for n=5000 and k=12.

But this requires implementing this logic.

For example, in Python, for a given L, we can precompute for each position k in the concatenated string the minimal character among the current candidates.

But this is getting complex.

Alternative approach:

For a given L, the best i is the one where the concatenated string s[:i] + s[i+L:] is lex smallest.

This can be found by finding the earliest i where the concatenated string is minimal.

But how?

Here's an idea inspired by the way we find the lex smallest string by removing k characters:

For each possible i, the concatenated string can be compared lex order with the current best candidate.

The comparison can be done in O(1) time using precomputed data structures.

But what data structures?

The key is to compare two candidates i and j by their concatenated strings.

This can be done using a sliding window approach.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, precompute for each possible i the concatenated string as a tuple of characters, and compare them. But this is not feasible for memory.

Another idea: realize that for the concatenated string to be lex smallest, the earliest possible difference between two candidates i and j must be in the first differing character.

Thus, the best candidate is the one where the first differing character between any two candidates is the smallest possible.

Thus, the best candidate is the one that has the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible character in the first position where candidates differ.

But again, this is not helpful for implementation.

At this point, given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible approach for Python is to implement the O(n^2) solution, and hope that it passes within the time limits.

So, the plan is:

1. Compute the number of operations k as floor(log2(len(s))).

2. For each operation from 1 to k:

   a. Compute the required deletion length L = 2^i -1, where i is the operation number (1-based).

   b. Iterate over all possible i (starting indices) where a substring of length L can be deleted from the current string.

   c. For each possible i, compute the resulting string after deletion.

   d. Keep track of the lex smallest resulting string.

   e. Update the current string to be this lex smallest string.

3. After all operations, output the final string.

But for n=5000, and k=12, this is O( (n^2) * k) time, which may be too slow.

But perhaps in Python, with optimizations, it can pass.

But how to compute the resulting string for each i quickly.

Wait, in each step, the current string is a Python string. For each possible i, the resulting string is s[:i] + s[i+L:]. Creating this string for each i is O(n) time. For each operation, with O(n) possible i's, this is O(n^2) time.

For n=5000, 5000^2 = 25 million operations per step. For 12 steps, 300 million operations. This is way beyond Python's capacity (Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second).

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea:

To find the best i for each L without explicitly building the resulting string.

Instead, compare the candidates i and j by comparing their concatenated strings in a way that finds the first differing character without building the entire string.

For example, for candidates i and j:

We can compare the characters of their concatenated strings incrementally until a difference is found.

But how to model this.

For candidate i, the concatenated string is s[:i] + s[i+L:]. Let's call this s_i.

The length of s_i is len(s) - L.

For candidate j, the concatenated string is s_j = s[:j] + s[j+L:].

We need to find the first position k where s_i[k] != s_j[k], and compare the characters.

To compute s_i[k], we can determine whether k is in the prefix part (before i) or the suffix part (after i+L).

For example:

if k < i:

   s_i[k] = s[k]

else:

   s_i[k] = s[k + L]

Similarly for j.

Thus, to compare s_i and s_j:

Iterate k from 0 to len(s_i) -1:

   a = s_i[k] = s[k] if k < i else s[k + L]

   b = s_j[k] = s[k] if k < j else s[k + L]

   if a < b: s_i is better.

   if a > b: s_j is better.

   else: continue.

Thus, the first differing k determines the better candidate.

The key is to find the first k where a and b differ.

But comparing this way for all possible pairs is O(n^2) time.

But for the purpose of finding the best candidate i, perhaps we can do this in O(n) time per L.

The algorithm would be:

Initialize best_i = 0.

For each i in 1 to len(s) - L:

   Compare the concatenated strings of best_i and i.

   If i is better, update best_i to i.

The comparison between best_i and i is done by finding the first k where their characters differ.

This can be done in O(1) to O(len(s)) time, but in the worst case, it's O(len(s)) time.

But for n=5000 and 12 steps, this is 5000 * 12 * 5000 = 3e8 operations. Which is too slow.

Thus, another optimization is needed.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each possible i and j the first position where their concatenated strings differ. But this is O(n^3) time, which is impossible.

Alternative Idea: For each possible i, precompute the concatenated string's characters in a way that allows quick comparison.

But this is not feasible for memory.

Another Idea: Realize that the minimal candidate i is the one where the concatenated string has the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible character, then the next character, etc.

Thus, for each candidate i, the concatenated string can be viewed as a sequence of characters that can be compared lex order.

The best candidate is the one that is the smallest in lex order.

Thus, the minimal candidate can be found by iterating through all possible i and keeping track of the current best.

The problem is to find an efficient way to compare two candidates.

An alternative approach is to model the concatenated string as a tuple of indices into the original string, and compare them.

But this is abstract.

An alternative approach is to realize that the best candidate i is the one where the concatenated string is lex smallest. This can be found by comparing each candidate with the current best, and updating the best if a smaller candidate is found.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

best_i = 0

for i in 1 to len(s) - L:

   compare s[:best_i] + s[best_i+L:] and s[:i] + s[i+L:]

   if the latter is smaller, set best_i = i

After iterating all i, the best_i is the optimal.

But again, this requires comparing two strings of length O(n), which is O(n) per comparison.

Thus, this is O(n^2) time per operation.

To optimize this, we can compare the two strings incrementally, breaking as soon as a difference is found.

For example, when comparing i and best_i:

for k in 0 to len(s) - L -1:

   a = s[k] if k < best_i else s[k + L]

   b = s[k] if k < i else s[k + L]

   if a < b:

       break, best_i remains

   elif a > b:

       best_i = i

       break

   else:

       continue

Thus, the comparison can break early when a difference is found.

This reduces the average time per comparison.

In practice, this can be much faster than O(n) per comparison.

For example, if the first character of the concatenated strings differs, the comparison takes O(1) time.

Thus, this approach is worth trying.

Thus, the plan is:

For each operation:

1. Compute L = 2^i -1 (where i is the operation number, 1-based).

2. Iterate through all possible i in 0 to len(current_s) - L.

3. For each i, compare the concatenated string of i with the current best.

4. Update the best_i if the new i is better.

5. After processing all i, delete the best_i substring.

Implementing this comparison efficiently is key.

Thus, the code for comparing two candidates i and j can be written as follows:

def is_better(i, j, s, L):

    n = len(s)

    len_conc = n - L

    for k in range(len_conc):

        # get the character from i's concatenated string

        if k < i:

            a = s[k]

        else:

            a = s[k + L]

        # get the character from j's concatenated string

        if k < j:

            b = s[k]

        else:

            b = s[k + L]

        if a < b:

            return True  # i is better

        elif a > b:

            return False  # j is better

    return False  # equal, so j remains

Then, during each step:

current_s = list of characters.

best_i = 0

for i in range(1, len(current_s) - L + 1):

    if is_better(i, best_i, current_s, L):

        best_i = i

# delete the substring from best_i to best_i + L -1

current_s = current_s[:best_i] + current_s[best_i + L:]

But converting the string to a list and slicing is O(n) time per operation.

Thus, for each step, the time is O(n^2) in the worst case, but with the comparison breaking early, it's likely much faster.

But for n=5000 and k=12 steps, this is 12 * 5000^2 = 3e8 operations, which is way beyond Python's capabilities.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each possible i and L the characters of the concatenated string and compare them using binary representations or hashing. But this is also not feasible.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to implement this approach and see if it passes.

But let's think about the example:

Sample Input 1: 'adcbca' → len=6. k=floor(log2(6))=2.

Operations:

Operation 1 (i=1, L=2^1-1=1):

current_s = 'adcbca'

Possible i ranges from 0 to 5 (since len(current_s) -1 =5).

For each i in 0..5, the concatenated string is current_s[:i] + current_s[i+1:].

The possible candidates are:

i=0 → 'dcbca'

i=1 → 'acbca'

i=2 → 'adbca'

i=3 → 'adcca'

i=4 → 'adcbc'

i=5 → 'adcbca' (since deleting the last character)

We need to find the lex smallest among these.

The lex smallest is 'abca' (i=3 is 'adcba'? Wait, no. Let's compute:

current_s is 'a','d','c','b','c','a'.

For i=3, current_s[:3] is 'a','d','c', current_s[4:] is 'c','a'. So the concatenated string is 'a d c c a' → 'adcca'.

But the example's first step is to delete the 'c' at position 3 (0-based?), resulting in 'adcba'. So perhaps in the first step, L=1, and the best i is 2 (assuming 0-based indices).

Wait, perhaps the code is using 0-based indices.

But according to the code, for L=1, the possible i ranges from 0 to 5 (for a string of length 6).

If the current_s is 'adcbca', then:

i=0 → delete the first 'a' → 'dcbca'

i=1 → delete 'd' → 'acbca'

i=2 → delete 'c' → 'adbca'

i=3 → delete 'b' → 'adcca'

i=4 → delete 'c' → 'adcba'

i=5 → delete 'a' → 'adcb c'.

Among these, the lex smallest is 'acbca' (i=1) → 'acbca' is 'a c b c a', which is lex 'abca' when sorted.

Wait, no. 'acbca' is 'a', 'c', 'b', 'c', 'a' which is lex larger than 'abca'.

Wait, but the example's first step results in 'adcba', which is 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'.

Which is achieved by deleting the fourth character (0-based index 3) which is 'b'.

So for i=3, the resulting string is 'adc' + 'ca' → 'adc ca' → 'adc ca' → 'adcca'? Wait, no. Because i=3 is the starting index of the substring to delete of length 1.

So current_s is 'a','d','c','b','c','a'.

Deleting i=3 (length 1) gives 'a','d','c','c','a' → 'adcca'.

But in the example's note, after the first step, the string is 'adcba' (a d c b a), which is 5 characters.

This suggests that the problem's note is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the example's explanation.

But according to the code's logic, the first operation would choose the best i, which in this case may be i=4 (deleting the 'c' at index 4) which gives 'adcba'.

Yes! Because deleting i=4 (the 'c' at index 4) gives 'a','d','c','b','a' → 'adcba', which is lex smaller than 'adcba' and 'adcca'.

So the code would compare all possible i and find that deleting i=4 (the 'c' at index 4) gives the lex smallest string.

Thus, the code will select the best i=4.

Thus, the code should handle this correctly.

Thus, the code's approach is correct.

Thus, despite the initial confusion about the problem's note, the code should correctly compute the optimal deletions.

Thus, the plan is to implement this approach.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But for large n=5000, this will be too slow.

So, to optimize:

- Represent the current string as a list for faster slicing.

- For comparing two candidates i and j, compare character by character, but break early.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read the input string.

Compute k = floor(log2(n)), where n is the initial length of the string.

current_s = list(input().strip())

for i in 1 to k:

   L = 2^i - 1

   len_s = len(current_s)

   if L > len_s:

       break  # no possible deletion

   best_i = 0

   best_str = current_s[0:L-0] + current_s[L+0:]  # not sure

   for each possible i in 0 to len_s - L:

       compare with current best_i and update.

But for the comparison, use the is_better function.

But in code:

current_s is a list.

For each operation:

   L = 2^i - 1

   len_s = len(current_s)

   if len_s < L:

       break

   best_i = 0

   # compare all i from 0 to len_s - L

   for i in range(1, len_s - L + 1):

       # compare i and best_i

       # find the first differing character

       is_i_better = False

       for k in range(len_s - L):

           # get char for best_i

           if k < best_i:

               a = current_s[k]

           else:

               a = current_s[k + L]

           # get char for i

           if k < i:

               b = current_s[k]

           else:

               b = current_s[k + L]

           if a < b:

               # best_i is better

               break

           elif a > b:

               best_i = i

               break

           else:

               continue

       # after loop, if all chars are equal, best_i remains

   # after choosing best_i, update current_s

   current_s = current_s[:best_i] + current_s[best_i + L:]

Finally, print(''.join(current_s)).

But this code is O(k * n^2) time.

For n=5000 and k=12, this is 12 * 5000^2 = 3e8 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.

Thus, we need to find a way to optimize this.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each possible i and L the position where the characters start to differ from the current best_i.

But how.

Another Idea: For each operation, the minimal concatenated string is the one where the concatenated string is the smallest. We can find the minimal i by finding the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible character in the concatenated string's first differing position.

But how.

Alternatively, for each possible i, compute the concatenated string's first character and compare.

If the first character is the same, compare the second character, and so on.

But this can be done by precomputing for each position the minimal possible character.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The minimal concatenated string is the one where the window to delete is the lex largest possible. Because deleting a larger substring would result in a smaller string.

But this is not necessarily true, but perhaps it's a heuristic.

For example, for L=1, delete the largest possible character.

Thus, for each L, the best i is the one where the substring to delete is the lex largest possible.

Thus, the code can be modified to find the lex largest substring of length L, and delete it.

This approach can be implemented in O(n) time per operation.

Thus, this would reduce the time complexity to O(k * n), which is manageable.

But how to verify if this approach is correct.

Let's test the first example.

Example 1:

Input: adcbca.

First operation (L=1).

The largest possible character in the string is 'd' (ascii 100), 'c' (99), 'b' (98), etc.

The lex largest substring of length 1 is 'd' (position 1).

Deleting it gives 'acbca', which is 'a c b c a'. But the example's first step deletes the 'b' (position 3), which is 'adcba'.

But 'acbca' is lex smaller than 'adcba'.

Wait, 'acbca' is 'a', 'c', 'b', 'c', 'a' → which is lex larger than 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a' (adcba). So this approach would not select the correct i.

Thus, the approach of deleting the largest possible substring is incorrect.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the only way is to proceed with the original plan, but optimize the code.

Possible optimizations:

1. Represent the current string as a list.

2. For comparing two candidates i and j, use a loop that breaks as soon as a difference is found.

3. Precompute the current string as a list, and use indices to avoid creating new strings.

But even with these optimizations, it's unclear if Python can handle it.

Another Idea: Precompute the current string and for each possible i, compute the first position where the concatenated string differs from the current best candidate.

This can be done using a while loop that breaks at the first differing character.

Here's the code for comparing i and best_i:

def compare(i, j, s, L):

    n = len(s)

    len_conc = n - L

    for k in range(len_conc):

        if k < j:

            a = s[k]

        else:

            a = s[k + L]

        if k < i:

            b = s[k]

        else:

            b = s[k + L]

        if a < b:

            return j

        elif a > b:

            return i

    return j  # equal, keep j

But this returns the better of i and j.

Thus, during each step, the code can iterate through all possible i and keep track of the best_i.

But even this is O(n^2) time.

Another Idea: For each possible i, the concatenated string can be represented as the original string with a window removed. To find the lex smallest such string, the minimal i is the leftmost i where the window is such that the remaining string is lex smallest.

Thus, the minimal i is the one where, for the earliest possible k, the character at k in the concatenated string is the smallest possible.

Thus, the algorithm can proceed as follows:

For each k from 0 to len_conc-1:

   Find the minimal possible character at position k among all candidates.

   For each candidate i, compute the character at position k.

   Keep only those candidates i where the character at position k is equal to the minimal.

   If only one candidate remains, break.

   Otherwise, proceed to the next k.

This is similar to the way in which a trie is built.

This approach is O(n * len_conc) time per operation.

But len_conc is up to n.

Thus, it's O(n^2) time per operation, but the average case may be better.

But for n=5000, this is still O(25 million) per operation.

But perhaps this is manageable.

Thus, the code would be:

for each operation:

   L = 2^i -1

   len_s = len(current_s)

   len_conc = len_s - L

   candidates = list(range(len_s - L +1))

   for k in range(len_conc):

       min_char = 'z'

       for i in candidates:

           if k < i:

               c = current_s[k]

           else:

               c = current_s[k + L]

           if c < min_char:

               min_char = c

       # filter candidates to those with min_char at position k

       new_candidates = []

       for i in candidates:

           if k < i:

               c = current_s[k]

           else:

               c = current_s[k + L]

           if c == min_char:

               new_candidates.append(i)

       candidates = new_candidates

       if len(candidates) == 1:

           break

   best_i = candidates[0]

   current_s = current_s[:best_i] + current_s[best_i + L:]

This approach is O(n^2) per operation, but the actual time may be better due to early termination when only one candidate remains.

For example, for k=0, if there's a candidate with 'a', and others have higher characters, then after processing k=0, only those candidates with 'a' are left. If there's only one such candidate, we break.

Thus, this approach can be much faster in practice.

Thus, this is a viable approach.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows.

But even this approach is O(n^2) per operation.

For n=5000, this is 25 million operations per step, multiplied by 12 steps: 3e8 operations.

But in Python, even this is too slow.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to find a way to compute the best_i efficiently.

Another Idea: For each possible i, the concatenated string can be uniquely determined by the original string. Thus, the best_i is the one where the concatenated string is the lex smallest. This is the same as finding the minimal suffix of the original string when considering the deletion of a window of length L.

But how.

Alternatively, consider the concatenated string as a combination of the prefix and suffix. The minimal such string is the minimal combination of prefix and suffix.

But how to find this combination.

Another Idea: The minimal concatenated string is the minimal between all possible s[:i] + s[i+L:].

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal such string.

This is similar to finding the minimal string after deleting a substring of length L.

Thus, we can model this as a sliding window problem.

For example, for each possible i, the concatenated string is s[:i] + s[i+L:].

The minimal such string is the minimal among all these possibilities.

But how to find this efficiently.

But the problem remains.

Thus, given the time constraints, the only way to proceed is to implement the optimized code and hope that it passes.

Thus, here's the code:

Read the input string.

Compute k as the floor of log2(n).

For each operation from 1 to k:

   L = 2^i -1.

   len_s = len(current_s).

   if len_s < L: break.

   candidates = list(range(len_s - L + 1)).

   for k in 0 to len_s - L -1:

       find the minimal character among all candidates at position k.

       filter candidates to those with that character.

       if len(candidates) == 1: break.

   best_i = candidates[0].

   current_s = current_s[:best_i] + current_s[best_i + L:].

Thus, the code is implemented as follows.

But to compute log2(n), we can use the math module.

But in Python:

import math

n = len(s)

k = math.floor(math.log(n, 2))

But for n=1, log2(1) is 0. So k=0, and no operations are performed.

Thus, the code must handle this.

Thus, the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import math


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = list(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip())

    n = len(s)

    k = math.floor(math.log(n, 2)) if n > 0 else 0

    for op in range(1, k + 1):

       L = 2 ** op - 1

       len_s = len(s)

       if L > len_s:

           break

       len_conc = len_s - L

       candidates = list(range(len_s - L + 1))

       for k_pos in range(len_conc):

           min_char = 'z'

           # find the minimal character at position k_pos among candidates

           for i in candidates:

               if k_pos < i:

                   char = s[k_pos]

               else:

                   char = s[k_pos + L]

               if char < min_char:

                   min_char = char

           # filter candidates to those that have min_char at k_pos

           new_candidates = []

           for i in candidates:

```

Thus, the code's approach is not handling the examples correctly.

But according to the problem's note, the first example's first operation is to delete the 'c' at position 3 (original string) to get 'adcba', and the second operation deletes 'dcb' (positions 1-3) to get 'aba'.

Thus, the code's approach is not finding the correct i's.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

Thus, this suggests that the code's algorithm is not correct.

Thus, the initial approach of comparing all possible i's and choosing the best is needed.

But how to implement this correctly.

Thus, the correct code must compare the concatenated strings for all possible i's and select the lex smallest.

But the previous approach is too slow.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to find a way to find the best_i in O(n) time per operation.

Another Idea: The best_i is the leftmost i where the concatenated string is lex smallest.

Thus, we can find the best_i by comparing the concatenated strings in a way that prefers earlier i's if they are the same as others.

But how.

An alternative approach is to realize that for a given L, the best_i is the one that minimizes the string s[:i] + s[i+L:].

To find this, we can iterate through each possible i and keep track of the best candidate.

But to compare two candidates efficiently, we can find the first position where their concatenated strings differ.

But in Python, comparing two strings is optimized and is done in C, which is much faster.

Thus, perhaps the code can be written as follows:

current_s = input().strip()

n = len(current_s)

k = math.floor(math.log(n, 2)) if n >0 else 0

for op in range(1, k+1):

   L = 2 ** op -1

   if L > len(current_s):

       break

   best = None

   best_str = None

   for i in range(len(current_s) - L + 1):

       new_str = current_s[:i] + current_s[i+L:]

       if best is None or new_str < best_str:

           best_str = new_str

   current_s = best_str

print(current_s)

This code explicitly constructs all possible new_str and compares them.

But for n=5000 and L=1, this is O(n^2) time, which is 25 million operations. For 12 steps, 3e8 operations.

This is way too slow for Python.

But perhaps for smaller n, this code works.

But for the first example, this code would correctly find the best_str.

Thus, the code works correctly, but is not efficient enough for large n.

Thus, the problem requires an O(n) or O(n log n) per operation algorithm.

Thus, the key is to find a way to find the best_i in O(n) time per operation.

An efficient way to find the best_i is needed.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:

The optimal i for a given L is the one where the concatenated string s[:i] + s[i+L:] is lex smallest.

This is equivalent to finding the minimal possible string after deleting a window of length L.

To find this efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach.

The minimal string can be found by finding the earliest occurrence of the minimal possible prefix.

But how.

For example, the minimal string after deletion must start with the earliest occurrence of the smallest possible character.

Thus, the best i is the one that allows the minimal possible first character.

If multiple i's allow this, then we look for the minimal second character, and so on.

Thus, the algorithm can be:

For each operation:

   L = 2^op -1.

   len_s = len(current_s).

   best_i = 0.

   for i in 1.. len_s - L:

       compare the concatenated strings of best_i and i.

       if the concatenated string of i is smaller, update best_i to i.

   current_s = concatenated string of best_i.

But comparing the two strings is done by comparing them directly.

In Python, comparing two strings is efficient as it's implemented in C.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

current_s = input().strip()

n = len(current_s)

k = math.floor(math.log(n, 2)) if n >0 else 0

for op in range(1, k+1):

   L = 2 ** op -1

   if L > len(current_s):

       break

   best_i = 0

   best_str = current_s[:0] + current_s[0+L:]

   for i in range(1, len(current_s) - L +1):

       candidate_str = current_s[:i] + current_s[i+L:]

       if candidate_str < best_str:

           best_str = candidate_str

           best_i = i

   current_s = best_str

print(current_s)

But this code is O(k * n^2) time.

For n=5000 and k=12, this is 3e8 operations, which is way too slow for Python.

But for the given examples, this code works.

For example, the first example:

Operation 1: L=1.

The possible i's are 0-5.

The best_str is found by comparing all i's.

But for i=3 (deleting 'b'), the resulting string is 'adc' + 'ca' → 'adcca'.

But in the example's note, the first step deletes the 'c' (i=2) to get 'adcba'.

Thus, the code must choose the i that gives the lex smallest string.

But why is 'adcba' not considered?

Wait, the original string is 'adcbca'.

Deleting i=3 (L=1) → 'adc' + 'ca' → 'adcca'.

Deleting i=4 (L=1) → 'adcba' → which is 'a d c b a'.

Comparing 'adcca' and 'adcba', 'adcba' is lex smaller.

Thus, the code would select i=4 as best_i.

Thus, the code correctly finds the best_i.

Thus, the code is correct, but it's too slow for large n.

Thus, the only way to proceed is to find a way to compare the candidate strings without explicitly constructing them.

Another Idea: Precompute the order of candidates by comparing their concatenated strings using the original string.

For example, for two candidates i and j, the concatenated strings are s_i and s_j.

We can compare s_i and s_j by comparing the original string, skipping the deleted window.

Thus, comparing s_i and s_j can be done without building the entire string.

This reduces the time per comparison to O(1) time in the best case (if the first differing character is found quickly).

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

current_s = input().strip()

n = len(current_s)

k = math.floor(math.log(n, 2)) if n >0 else 0

for op in range(1, k+1):

   L = 2 ** op -1

   if L > len(current_s):

       break

   best_i = 0

   len_s = len(current_s)

   for i in range(1, len_s - L +1):

       # compare i and best_i

       is_i_better = False

       for k_pos in range(len_s - L):

           # get char from best_i's concatenated string

           if k_pos < best_i:

               a = current_s[k_pos]

           else:

               a = current_s[k_pos + L]

           # get char from i's concatenated string

           if k_pos < i:

               b = current_s[k_pos]

           else:

               b = current_s[k_pos + L]

           if a < b:

               break

           elif a > b:

               is_i_better = True

               break

       if is_i_better:

           best_i = i

   # delete best_i

   current_s = current_s[:best_i] + current_s[best_i+L:]

print(current_s)

But this code is O(k * n^2) time, which is still too slow.

Thus, this problem requires an O(n) time per operation algorithm, which I'm not seeing.

Given the time constraints, the correct code for this problem is the one that correctly implements the O(n^2) approach, but optimized to pass within the time limits.

But given that the problem allows n up to 5000 and k up to 12, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, there must be a smarter way.

Another Idea: For each possible i, the concatenated string can be viewed as the original string with a window removed. The lex smallest such string is the one where the window is the lex largest possible substring of length L.

But this is not necessarily true, but perhaps it's a valid approach.

For example, the lex largest window of length L, when deleted, leaves the lex smallest string.

Thus, the code can be modified to find the lex largest window of length L and delete it.

This can be done in O(n) time per operation.

But does this approach work for the examples?

Example 1:

Original string: 'adcbca'.

L=1. The lex largest window is 'd' (i=1). Deleting it gives 'acbca'.

But the example's note deletes 'b
