Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of 2x2 squares in an image that form the word "face". Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that a face is a 2x2 square where the four letters can be rearranged to form "face". So each of the four characters must be exactly 'f', 'a', 'c', 'e', and there's one of each. So for each possible 2x2 square in the image, I need to check if the four characters are a permutation of those four letters.

The constraints are n and m up to 50. So the maximum number of 2x2 squares possible would be (n-1) * (m-1), since the square starts at row i and column j, where i ranges from 0 to n-2 and j from 0 to m-2 (assuming zero-based indices). For n=50 and m=50, that's 49*49=2401 squares. Checking each of these should be manageable even with a straightforward approach, since 2400 iterations are nothing for Python's speed.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a 2x2 square.
2. For each square, collect the four characters.
3. Check if these four characters are exactly 'f', 'a', 'c', 'e' (each appearing once).
4. Count how many such squares exist.

Now, how to collect the four characters? For each (i, j) as the top-left corner, the four positions are (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). So for each i from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), and j from 0 to m-2 (inclusive), check those four cells.

To check if the four characters form "face", perhaps the simplest way is to create a set of the four characters and see if the set equals {'f','a','c','e'}, and also ensure there are exactly four characters (since a set would eliminate duplicates). Wait, but if all four are the same, the set size would be 1. So yes, checking that the set is exactly those four letters would suffice.

For example, in the first sample input:

The square has characters 'f', 'a', 'c', 'e' (in any order). The set of these would be {'f','a','c','e'}, so that's valid.

So the steps for each 2x2 square:

- Collect the four characters into a list or set.
- Check if the set has exactly four elements and contains all four required letters.

Wait, but the set approach would work because the required letters are all distinct. So if the four characters form a set of size 4 and the set is equal to {'f','a','c','e'}, then it's a valid face.

So the code would look something like:

count = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        chars = [image[i][j], image[i][j+1], image[i+1][j], image[i+1][j+1]]
        if set(chars) == {'f', 'a', 'c', 'e'}:
            count +=1

That's straightforward.

But what about the order of the characters? No, the problem states that you can rearrange the four letters to make "face". So any permutation is allowed. So the set check is correct.

So the approach is correct.

Now, handling the input. The input is read as n lines, each line being a string of m characters.

In Python, read the first line as n and m, then read n lines, stripping any whitespace (since each line is a string of m lowercase letters). Then, process each possible 2x2 square as described.

Let me test this logic against the sample inputs.

First sample input:

4 4
xxxx
xfax
xcex
xxxx

The image rows are:

Row 0: 'xxxx'
Row 1: 'xfax'
Row 2: 'xcex'
Row 3: 'xxxx'

Looking for 2x2 squares. The valid squares are (i from 0 to 2, j from 0 to 2):

i=1, j=1: The square is f, a, c, e. So the set is {'f','a','c','e'}, which counts. So that's the one.

Another possible square is at i=1, j=2. The characters are a, x, e, x. So set is {'a','x','e'}, which is invalid.

So the code correctly counts 1.

Second sample input:

4 2
xx
cf
ae
xx

The rows are:

Row0: 'xx'

Row1: 'cf'

Row2: 'ae'

Row3: 'xx'

The possible 2x2 squares are when i can be 0,1,2 (since n=4, i ranges up to 4-2=2). j can be 0 (since m=2, j can be 0 up to 2-2=0). So i=1, j=0: the square is c, f, a, e. The set is {'c','f','a','e'}, which is valid.

Thus the code would count 1.

Third sample:

2 3
fac
cef

The possible 2x2 squares are i can be 0 (since 2-2=0), j can be 0 and 1 (since 3-2=1). So two squares.

First square (i=0, j=0): 'f','a','c','e' â†’ set is correct. Counts as 1.

Second square (i=0, j=1): 'a','c','e','f' â†’ set is correct. So two squares, output is 2. Which matches the sample.

Fourth sample: 1x4, "face". Since n=1, there are no 2x2 squares (need i to be up to 0, but 1-2= -1, so loop doesn't run). So output 0.

So the code works for all samples.

Now, considering the constraints. Even for n=50 and m=50, the code will run 49*49=2401 iterations. Each iteration involves extracting four characters and checking a set. In Python, this is very fast. So even with 50x50, it's okay.

So the code is optimal. There's no need for any more optimized data structures here. Since the possible input size is small, the O(nm) approach (actually O((n-1)(m-1)) ) is acceptable.

Now, let's implement the code.

Read n and m from input. Then read n lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace (though the problem says each line has exactly m letters). So read each line as input().strip()

Then, for each possible i from 0 to n-2, and j from 0 to m-2:

Check the four characters.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    image = [input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip() for _ in range(n)]

    count = 0
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(m-1):
            a = image[i][j]
            b = image[i][j+1]
            c = image[i+1][j]
            d = image[i+1][j+1]
            s = {a, b, c, d}
            if s == {'f', 'a', 'c', 'e'}:
                count += 1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4 2
xx
cf
ae
xx
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Wait, the first sample's image is:

Line 1 after the first input line (n=4, m=4) is 'xfax' â†’ row 1 (0-based). The next line is 'xcex' â†’ row 2.

So for i=1 (second row), j=1 (second column):

The four characters are:

image[1][1] = 'f'

image[1][2] = 'a'

image[2][1] = 'c'

image[2][2] = 'e' â†’ so the set is {'f','a','c','e'}, which is correct.

So the code would count that.

In the first sample, the code correctly outputs 1.

So yes, the code works.

Another test case: third sample.

n=2, m=3.

image[0] = 'fac' â†’ indexes 0: 'f', 1: 'a', 2: 'c'.

image[1] = 'cef' â†’ indexes 0: 'c', 1: 'e', 2: 'f'.

i can be 0 (since 2-1=1-1=1-2=0).

j can be 0 and 1.

For j=0:

a = 'f', b = 'a', c = 'c', d = 'e' â†’ set is {'f','a','c','e'} â†’ valid.

For j=1:

a = 'a', b = 'c', c = 'e', d = 'f' â†’ set is {'a','c','e','f'} â†’ valid.

Thus, count is 2.

So code works.

This code should handle all cases. Now, for memory optimization: since the constraints are small, there's no issue. Even reading the entire image into a list is okay.

The code is straightforward and optimal for the given constraints.

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
image = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
count = 0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(m-1):
        a, b = image[i][j], image[i][j+1]
        c, d = image[i+1][j], image[i+1][j+1]
        if {a, b, c, d} == {'f', 'a', 'c', 'e'}:
            count += 1
print(count)
```
