Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the maximum number of paths in an efficient timetable. The efficient timetable means no path is contained within another. So each path in the set must not be a subset of another. And the paths must have length at least 2 (so at least two vertices, but since the length is the number of vertices in the path, that's two or more, meaning the path has at least two edges? Wait, no. Wait the length is the number of vertices. So a path with two vertices is length 2, which is allowed. So each path in the set must have at least two vertices. And the main constraint is that no path is a subset of another.

So the problem reduces to selecting as many paths as possible such that none are contained in each other. How do we maximize this count?

First, let's think about the structure of such a set. Each selected path must be maximal in the sense that there's no longer path that includes it. So maybe we should choose paths that are as "small" as possible. Because then, they can't be contained in a larger path. Wait, but the problem requires that no two paths are in a subset relationship. So for any two paths in the set, neither is a subset of the other. So each path is a maximal path in the set. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to select all possible edges (since each edge is a path of length 2) that are not part of any longer path. But wait, edges can be part of longer paths. For example, in a star-shaped tree, all edges are part of longer paths. So in that case, maybe choosing all the edges (each as a path of length 2) would not be allowed if any longer path is selected. So in the first example, they chose three paths of length 2 (edges) and the answer was 3. But another option was choosing three paths of length 3. So the maximum possible is 3 for that case.

So the answer depends on the tree's structure. The goal is to select as many paths as possible, each not contained in another.

Let me think of the possible approach. Maybe the problem is equivalent to finding a matching of paths where no path is a subset of another. How can we model this?

Alternatively, think about the tree's structure. Each path can be characterized by its two endpoints. A path is uniquely determined by its endpoints. So any path between two nodes u and v is the unique simple path between them in a tree. So perhaps the problem can be rephrased as selecting a set of paths (each of length >=2) such that for any two paths in the set, neither is a subset of the other.

So we need to maximize the number of such paths.

Now, how to model this? Let's consider all possible paths. The key is that for a path P to be included, no longer path that includes P can be in the set. So the selection must consist of paths that are "maximal" in their own way, but not necessarily all of the same length.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to select all possible paths that are edges (length 2), except for those that lie on longer paths. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, but in the first example, all edges (length 2) are connected to the root. If you select all edges, then each is a path of length 2, and none contain each other. So that gives three paths. Which is the answer. Alternatively, if you select paths of length 3, like the star's three paths (each combining two edges), but then those paths would be longer. But in that case, you can't select the edges. So the maximum between the two options is 3, which is the same as selecting the edges. So the optimal solution here is to select all the edges.

But in the second example, the answer is 7. Let's see the structure. The tree is a chain-like structure. Let me visualize it:

The tree is 2-1-3-4-6 and 4-7, and 3-5. So the structure is:

1 connected to 2 and 3. Then 3 is connected to 4 and 5. 4 is connected to 6 and 7.

So the sample input's tree looks like this:

2
|
1
|
3
/ | \
2 5 4
       / \
      6   7

Wait, the input is:

7 nodes. The edges are:

2-1

3-2 (Wait no, the edges are:

The input lines are:

2 1

3 2

4 3

5 3

6 4

7 4

So the tree is:

1 connected to 2.

2 connected to 3.

3 connected to 4 and 5.

4 connected to 6 and 7.

So the tree structure is like a chain:

1 - 2 - 3 -4 -6

and 3 has 5, 4 has 7.

So the example's optimal solution is 7 paths. Let's see how those paths are selected. The paths in the sample note are:

{1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {3,4,6}, {2,3,5}, {3,4,5}, {3,4,7}, {4,6,7}.

Wait, each of these is a path of length 3 (3 vertices), except the last one {4,6,7} which is a path of length 3 (since it's a path from 6 to 7 through 4). Hmm, but how are these paths arranged such that none is a subset of another.

For example, the path {2,3,4} is part of a longer path like 2-3-4-6. But none of the selected paths in the set are longer. So in this case, all selected paths are of length 3 (3 vertices), which are edges of length 2 (since the path has two edges). Wait, no. A path with three vertices has two edges, so length 3. So the problem statement allows any path of length >=2. So the paths in the sample are all allowed.

But how can they all be non-overlapping in the subset sense. For example, {3,4,5} is a path from 3 to 5 through 4? Wait no. Wait the path from 3 to 5 is directly via edge 3-5. So the path is just two vertices. But in the sample, it's written as {3,4,5} which must be a path from 3 to 5 via 4. But in the tree, 3 is connected to 5 directly. So such a path doesn't exist. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the note? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tree structure.

Wait the sample input edges are:

Edges are:

2-1

3-2

4-3

5-3

6-4

7-4.

So the tree structure is:

1 is connected to 2.

2 is connected to 3.

3 is connected to 4 and 5.

4 is connected to 6 and 7.

So, for example, the path between 3 and 5 is the direct edge (3-5), which is length 2. So the path {3,5} is a path of length 2. But in the sample note, one of the paths is {2,3,5}, which is the path from 2 to 5 via 3. So that's a path of length 3 (vertices 2,3,5). So the path is 2-3-5. Then, another path is {3,4,5}? Wait, but how? 3 is connected to 4 and 5. So the path between 4 and 5 would be 4-3-5. So the path {3,4,5} would be the vertices 4,3,5. So that's a path of length 3. So in the sample's solution, these paths are included. Each of these paths is of length 3, and none is a subset of another.

So the maximum number here is 7. So how can we model this to find such paths.

Now, the key seems to be that each selected path must be a "maximal" path in some way, but perhaps not the longest possible. Alternatively, the approach could be to model the problem as selecting as many paths as possible, each of which cannot be extended to form a longer path. But that's not exactly right. For example, in the first sample, each edge (path of length 2) can be extended (if you take the root and two edges). But in that sample, selecting the edges gives the maximum.

Hmm. So perhaps the optimal approach is to find a way to select all possible edges (paths of length 2) and some other paths, but ensuring that none of them are contained in others.

Alternatively, the problem might be related to the number of leaves in the tree. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: model the problem as an interval graph. Each path can be considered as an interval on the tree (if the tree is arranged in a linear structure). Then, the problem becomes selecting a maximum set of intervals where none contains another. This is similar to the interval scheduling problem where we select non-overlapping intervals in a certain way. But for trees that are not linear, this approach might not work.

Wait, but trees can have various branching structures. So perhaps we need to model the problem by considering each possible path and determining which paths can be included in the set without being subsets of each other. But with n up to 3000, considering all possible paths (which could be O(n^2) in number) is not feasible for a naive approach.

Thus, we need a smarter way to compute the maximum possible set size.

Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a possible path (of length >=2), and edges represent the subset relation. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. However, this is computationally infeasible for n=3000.

Therefore, a greedy approach or some dynamic programming approach is needed, possibly based on the tree's structure.

Alternative idea: For each edge in the tree, count the number of leaves in each of the two subtrees formed by removing the edge. The product of these two numbers gives the number of paths that pass through this edge. Then, summing over all edges might give a total. Wait, but how does this relate to the problem's constraints?

Alternatively, the maximum number of paths is the sum over each node's children of (number of leaves in the subtree of the child) multiplied by (sum of leaves in the subtrees of other children). But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each path in the optimal set must be a path between two leaves. Because a path between two leaves can't be contained in any longer path (since it's already the longest possible path between those two leaves). So selecting all possible pairs of leaves and their paths. However, in a star-shaped tree, the number of leaves is 3, and the paths between any two leaves go through the center. So each such path has length 3. But the maximum possible set size here would be 3 (as in the first example), which is the number of edges (each path of length 2). So this approach wouldn't work because selecting all leaf-to-leaf paths would give C(3,2) =3 paths, each of length 3. So that's the same as the first example's maximum. But in that case, the answer is 3. So maybe this approach could work.

Wait, but in the second example, the tree has leaves at 1,5,6,7. So the paths between leaves would be 1-5 (path length 3), 1-6 (path length 5), 1-7 (path length 5), 5-6 (path length 5), 5-7 (path length 5), 6-7 (path length 3). So there are 6 possible leaf-to-leaf paths, but the sample answer is 7. So this approach would not account for all possible paths. Thus, this suggests that the optimal solution includes non-leaf paths.

Hmm. So perhaps the approach of selecting all possible paths that are not contained in any longer paths. But how to model this.

Let's think: a path is called maximal if there is no longer path that contains it. So, for example, in the first sample, the edges (paths of length 2) are not maximal because each is contained in longer paths (like the path from 2 to 3 through 1). However, in the sample, the edges are selected, but since no longer path is in the set, it's allowed. Wait, no. Wait the problem states that in the efficient timetable, no path in the set is redundant. So if two paths are in the set, neither can be a subset of the other. So in the first sample, the edges are all in the set, and none are subsets of each other. So that's allowed.

Alternatively, the optimal solution is to select all the edges (paths of length 2) where each edge is a leaf edge. Because a leaf edge is not part of any longer path except those that start or end at the leaf.

Wait, but in the first sample, all edges are connected to the root. The leaves are 2,3,4. Each edge is a leaf edge. So selecting those gives three paths. But the paths between any two leaves (like 2-3) would be longer, but those are not in the set. So in this case, the maximum is achieved by selecting all leaf edges.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to select all possible edges (paths of length 2) that are leaves. But how to count them.

Wait, a leaf edge is an edge connected to a leaf node. So for each leaf, its adjacent edge is a leaf edge. So the number of leaf edges is equal to the number of leaves. But in the first example, there are three leaves (nodes 2,3,4), each connected to the root (node 1). So three leaf edges, which gives three paths, which is the maximum.

In the second example, the leaves are nodes 1,5,6,7. Each has a leaf edge. So four leaf edges, but the sample's answer is 7. So this approach is not sufficient.

Hmm. So the solution must be more complex than just selecting all leaf edges.

Alternative approach: model the tree and find for each node the number of children, then compute the maximum possible paths based on that.

Another idea: For each node, consider all the edges between the node and its children. The maximum number of paths that can be selected which are edges (paths of length 2) under this node is the number of children. But if we select these edges, then we cannot select any longer paths that pass through this node. So perhaps the optimal solution is to greedily select as many edges as possible, and then see if there's a way to include longer paths where possible.

But how to balance this.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where each path is a node and edges represent subset relations. Then the maximum independent set would give the answer. But this is not feasible computationally.

Alternatively, think in terms of the tree's edges. Each path can be represented by a pair of nodes. To ensure no path contains another, perhaps the selected paths must be such that their endpoints do not lie on a single path. For example, if a path between u and v is selected, then no path between u and any ancestor of v (or vice versa) can be selected, as that would create a subset.

But this is unclear.

Wait, let's think of a path as a set of vertices. Two paths P and Q are such that neither is a subset of the other. So their sets are incomparable. So the problem is to select as many vertex sets (paths) as possible, each of size >=2, such that no two are comparable.

This is equivalent to selecting an antichain of paths in the inclusion lattice of all paths. According to Sperner's theorem, the maximum size of an antichain in a Boolean lattice is the binomial coefficient of n choose floor(n/2). But this is for subsets of a set. However, here the elements are paths in a tree, which form a different structure. So Sperner's theorem doesn't directly apply.

But perhaps the maximum antichain is achieved by choosing all paths of a certain length. For example, in the first sample, all paths of length 2 (edges) are selected, giving the maximum. In the second sample, all paths of length 3 are selected, which sum up to 7. But how to determine which length to choose for maximum count.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to choose all paths of a certain length k, where k is chosen such that there are as many such paths as possible, and none are contained in another.

But in a tree, the paths of a certain length may overlap. For example, two paths of length 3 may be such that one is a subset of another. For example, path A-B-C-D and path B-C-D-E would have B-C-D as a subset, but these are different paths. Wait no, if the tree is a chain A-B-C-D-E, then the path from B to D is of length 3 (B-C-D), and the path from B to E is B-C-D-E (length 4), which contains B-C-D. So including B-C-D in the set would exclude B-C-D-E, but the B-C-D path could be part of the set.

But in the sample where the answer is 7, all selected paths are of length 3. So perhaps the optimal approach is to select all possible paths of length 3 (three vertices) which are not contained in any longer paths. But how to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the maximum number of paths such that each path has exactly two edges (so three vertices). Because these paths can't contain each other unless one is a subpath of the other. But if the paths are such that none is a subpath of another, then they can all be selected.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of such three-node paths that are not contained in any longer path. But how to model this.

Another idea: for each edge in the tree, count the number of ways to form a three-node path that uses this edge. Then, summing these counts would give the total number of possible three-node paths. But some of these paths might be contained in longer paths.

Alternatively, perhaps each three-node path is a simple path of two edges. So each such path is a chain of three nodes connected in a straight line. To avoid having one such path contained in a longer one, perhaps the three-node path must be a maximal path (i.e., cannot be extended on either end). For example, in a chain A-B-C-D, the three-node paths are A-B-C, B-C-D. Each of these can be selected as they are not contained in any longer three-node paths. Wait, but the path B-C-D is part of a longer path A-B-C-D (length 4). So if we select B-C-D, then we cannot select any longer path that includes it. But if all selected paths are three-node paths, then none of them can contain each other. Because a three-node path can only be contained in a longer path (four or more nodes). So by selecting all possible three-node paths, we can ensure that none are subsets of each other. Thus, the maximum possible count is the number of three-node paths.

But in the first sample, the three-node paths are 1-2-3 (if that's allowed?), wait the first sample's tree is a star with root 1 connected to 2,3,4. So any three-node path would be 1 connected to two of its children. For example, the path 2-1-3 is a three-node path. Similarly, 2-1-4, etc. But each of these paths has length 3. So there are three possible three-node paths. So selecting them gives the answer 3, which matches the first sample. But the sample's answer can also be achieved by selecting the edges (paths of length 2). So why is the three-node approach better? Because in this case, both approaches give the same count.

In the second sample, the number of three-node paths may be higher. Let's see. For example:

Each three-node path is a chain of three nodes. Let's see the structure:

The tree is 1-2-3-4-6 and 4-7, and 3-5.

Three-node paths:

1-2-3 → yes.

2-3-4 → yes.

3-4-6 → yes.

3-4-7 → yes.

3-5 (only two nodes; no. So what about 2-3-5 → yes, that's three nodes. Path 2-3-5.

Also, 3-4-6 is three nodes. 3-4-7 is three nodes. 4-6-7 is another three-node path (path 6-4-7).

Also, in the tree, node 3 is connected to 4 and 5. So for the path 3-4-6, 3-4-7, 4-6-7 (three nodes). So how many three-node paths are there?

Let's list all possible three-node paths:

1. 1-2-3 → length 3.

2. 2-3-4 → length 3.

3. 3-4-6 → length 3.

4. 3-4-7 → length 3.

5. 2-3-5 → length 3.

6. 4-6-7 → length 3. (path 6-4-7)

7. 3-4-5 → but how? 3 is connected to 5 directly, so the path from 3 to 5 is length 2. But the path from 4 to 5 would be 4-3-5. So that's three nodes: 4,3,5. So that's a three-node path.

So that's 7 three-node paths, which matches the sample's answer of 7. So by selecting all possible three-node paths, the sample's answer is achieved.

So perhaps the optimal solution is to count all possible three-node paths (paths of length 3, consisting of two edges) and that's the maximum possible. Because these paths can't contain each other, as any two three-node paths that are contained within each other would have to be the same path. Because a three-node path cannot be a subset of another three-node path unless they are the same.

Wait, for example, consider a chain A-B-C-D. The three-node paths are A-B-C and B-C-D. Neither is a subset of the other. So they can both be selected. Now, if there's a longer path like A-B-C-D-E, the three-node paths are A-B-C, B-C-D, C-D-E. All three can be selected, and none are contained in each other.

Thus, the number of three-node paths in the tree is the answer.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of three-node paths in the tree.

So how to compute that.

Each three-node path is a path of exactly two edges, i.e., a chain of three nodes. So for each such path, the middle node is the one connecting the two edges. So for each node u, we can count the number of pairs of distinct neighbors (v, w) such that v and w are not connected via a path through u (which is not possible in a tree). Wait, no. Because in a tree, any two neighbors of u are in different subtrees, so the path between v and w must go through u. So for any two distinct neighbors of u, the path v-u-w is a three-node path. Thus, for each node u, the number of three-node paths with u as the middle node is equal to C(k, 2), where k is the number of neighbors of u. Because for each pair of neighbors, there is a three-node path.

So the total number of three-node paths is the sum over all nodes u of C(k_u, 2), where k_u is the degree of u.

Wait, let's check this.

In the first sample:

The root node 1 has degree 3. So C(3,2) = 3. The other nodes (2,3,4) have degree 1. So their contribution is 0. So total is 3, which matches the sample.

In the second sample:

Let's look at the degrees:

Node 1: degree 1 (connected to 2). So C(1,2) = 0.

Node 2: degree 2 (connected to 1 and 3). C(2,2) = 1.

Node 3: degree 3 (connected to 2,4,5). C(3,2) =3.

Node 4: degree 3 (connected to 3,6,7). C(3,2)=3.

Node 5: degree 1 → 0.

Node 6: degree 1 → 0.

Node 7: degree 1 → 0.

So sum is 1 +3 +3 =7. Which matches the sample's output.

So this formula gives the correct answer for both samples.

Thus, the problem reduces to summing C(k_u, 2) for all nodes u, where k_u is the degree of u.

That's a brilliant insight! Because each three-node path is determined by the middle node and two of its neighbors. So for a node with degree d, the number of three-node paths centered at it is d choose 2, which is d*(d-1)/2.

So the answer is simply the sum over all nodes of (degree(u) choose 2).

Thus, the code is straightforward. We compute the degree of each node and sum d*(d-1)//2 for each node.

So the steps are:

1. Read n.

2. Read n-1 edges.

3. Compute the degree of each node.

4. For each node, compute (degree choose 2) and sum all.

5. Output the sum.

But why does this approach work? Because each three-node path is counted exactly once, and all such paths are non-nested (as a three-node path can't be contained in another three-node path, since they have the same length). Moreover, no longer paths are included in the set, so there's no nesting possible. Thus, the set of all three-node paths is a valid efficient timetable, and the maximum possible size is the sum of C(d,2) for all degrees d.

But why is this the maximum possible? Suppose there's a way to select more paths by including some of longer length. But according to the sample, when including longer paths, the count may not be higher. For example, in the first sample, the three-node paths (sum 3) is the same as the number of edges. But the sample's second option also uses three paths of length 3. So the count is the same.

But in the case of a chain of four nodes: A-B-C-D. The degrees are B:2, C:2, A and D have degree 1. So sum is 1 +1 =2. The three-node paths are A-B-C and B-C-D. So two paths. But if we select paths of length 4 (A-B-C-D), then we can only select one path, which is worse. So the sum of C(d,2) gives the optimal count.

Another example: a star with 4 nodes. The root has degree 3. The sum is 3 choose 2=3. Which is correct.

Thus, the conclusion is that the maximum number of paths is the sum over all nodes of (degree choose 2).

Thus, the code is simply to compute this sum.

So the code is:

Read n.

Initialize a list for degrees.

For each of the next n-1 edges, increment the degrees of the two nodes.

Sum for each node, d*(d-1)//2.

Output the sum.

Yes! That's the solution.

Let's test this with the given examples.

First example input:

4 nodes.

Edges:

1-2, 1-3, 1-4.

Degrees:

1:3, others:1.

Sum is 3*(3-1)/2 =3.

Second example:

7 nodes.

Edges as given.

Degrees:

Node 2: degree 2 (edges 1 and 3)

Node 3: degree 3 (2,4,5)

Node 4: degree 3 (3,6,7)

Other nodes have degree 1.

So sum is (2C2)+(3C2)+(3C2) =1 +3 +3=7.

Which matches the sample.

So the code is correct.
