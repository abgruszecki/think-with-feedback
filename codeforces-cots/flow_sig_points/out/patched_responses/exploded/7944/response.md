Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by selecting certain positions in the original string such that every m-length window has at least one selected position. Then, we can rearrange the selected characters in any order. So the goal is to pick the optimal set of characters that allows for the smallest possible arrangement, which would just be the sorted characters in ascending order.

First, I need to understand the selection constraints. The selected positions must cover every window of size m. So for every position j in the string (from 0 to len(s) - m), the window [j, j + m -1] must have at least one selected index.

But how do we choose these indices optimally to get the lex smallest string? Since after selection we can rearrange the characters, the order of selection doesn't matter for the final string. The key is to select the minimal possible set of characters (sorted) that satisfies the coverage condition.

Wait, but the problem allows rearrangement, so the optimal approach is to select the smallest possible characters in such a way that their positions cover all m-length windows, and then arrange them in order. But how to model this?

Hmm, perhaps the strategy is to find the minimal required set of characters (the ones with the smallest possible lex order) such that their positions cover all the m-length windows. For example, in the first sample, choosing the 'a' in the third position (index 2, 0-based) covers all possible windows of length 3. Since the string is "cbabc", the windows are [0-2], [1-3], [2-4]. The selected index 2 is in all three windows, so it's sufficient. Then the result is 'a' which is the smallest possible.

So the approach is to select the earliest possible smallest characters such that their positions are spaced in a way that every m-length window is covered. The key is that the selected positions must form a covering set, and among all possible covering sets, we need the one with the lex smallest multiset of characters (which would be sorted in order).

But how to model the selection of such a set. Let's think of it as a greedy problem. We want the earliest occurrence of the smallest possible character, but ensuring that their positions are no more than m-1 apart. Because each selected position can cover a window of m. So if two selected positions are more than m-1 apart, there's a window between them that isn't covered.

Wait, the positions need to be such that any m consecutive positions in the original string have at least one selected index. So the selected indices must form a set where no two consecutive are more than m-1 apart, but also considering overlaps.

Alternatively, the problem is similar to interval covering. The entire string is covered by overlapping intervals of length m. We need to select a set of points (indices) such that each interval contains at least one point. Then, the multiset of characters at these points is sorted lex smallest.

So the goal is to find a minimal (in terms of lex order) multiset of characters such that their positions cover all m-length intervals. But how?

The lex smallest possible multiset is the sorted list of the smallest possible characters. So perhaps the strategy is to select the earliest possible smallest characters in such a way that the coverage is maintained.

This feels like a problem that can be approached greedily. Let's process the string and select characters in a way that ensures coverage and picks the smallest possible characters first.

But how to model the coverage. Let's think of the positions that need to be covered. For example, the first window is positions 0 to m-1. There must be at least one selected position here. Then, the next window is 1 to m. So the selected positions need to cover all these.

An efficient way to model this is to track the earliest position in the current window that can be chosen, ensuring that the selection covers up to that point and allows the rest of the string to be covered.

Alternatively, we can model this as follows: For each position i in the string, the earliest position where the next selection can be made to ensure coverage. So after selecting a position at i, the next selection must be no later than i + m - 1. Because if we select a position at i, then the next selection needs to be within the next m-1 positions to cover the next window that starts at i+1, etc.

Wait, perhaps that's a possible approach. Let me think. When we select a position, say at index k, the next selection must be at most k + m - 1 + 1? Not sure.

Alternatively, the selected positions must be such that between any two consecutive selected positions, the distance is at most m-1. Because if two selected positions are more than m-1 apart, then there's a window between them that is not covered.

Wait, no. Because the windows are of length m. For example, if two selected positions are at i and j, where j = i + m, then the window starting at j - m + 1 would end at j. So the window from j - m +1 to j includes j. But the window i+1 to i+m (if j is i + m) would be the window starting at i+1 and ending at i+m. But the selected positions are i and j. So the window i+1 to i+m has no selected positions. So that's a problem.

Therefore, the maximum allowed distance between two consecutive selected positions is m. Because if they are m apart, then the first is at i, next at i + m. Then, the window starting at i+1 will end at i+m. So in that window, there's no selected position. Hence, the maximum allowed distance between consecutive selected positions is m-1. So, consecutive selected positions must be at most m-1 apart. That way, any window will have at least one selected position.

Wait, but how? Let's see. Suppose we have selected positions at i and j, where j = i + m-1. Then the next selected position can be at j + k, where k <= m-1. Wait, perhaps the idea is that the selected positions must form a sequence where each consecutive pair is at most m-1 apart. Because then, any window of size m will have at least one selected position.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example. Suppose m=3. The selected positions are 0, 3. The distance between them is 3, which is m. Then the window starting at 1 (positions 1,2,3) includes 3. The window starting at 2 (positions 2,3,4) includes 3. The next window after 3 is 3,4,5 which includes 3. Then, the next selected position after 3 is 6. The distance is 3 again. So the window starting at 4 (4-6) would have 6. So maybe it's possible to have selected positions spaced m apart. Hmm, but then some windows would not be covered.

Wait, in the case where selected positions are 0,3,6,... with m=3. Then the window starting at 1 (positions 1,2,3) has 3. The window starting at 2 (2,3,4) has 3. The window starting at 3 (3,4,5) has 3, but the next selected position is 6. So the window starting at 4 (4,5,6) has 6. The window starting at 5 (5,6,7) has 6. So all windows are covered. So in that case, even though the selected positions are spaced m apart, the coverage is maintained. Because each window of size m must contain at least one selected position.

Wait, that's possible. So for example, the selected positions are at positions 0,3,6,... (m=3). Then, each window of size m is covered. Because the selected positions are spaced exactly m apart. So for example, the window starting at 1 (positions 1,2,3) includes 3. The next window at 2 (2,3,4) includes 3. The next at 3 (3,4,5) includes 3. Then, the next at 4 (4,5,6) includes 6. So yes, each window has at least one selected position.

So the maximum allowed distance between consecutive selected positions is m. Because if they are m apart, then the first window starts at i, and the next selected is at i + m. Then, the window i+1 to i + m (since m=3, window size is 3, that's positions i+1, i+2, i+3). The selected position is at i + m, which is included in that window.

Wait, but in that case, the distance between selected positions can be m. So the maximum allowed is m, not m-1. So earlier reasoning was wrong. Hmm. So this complicates the approach.

So the key is to model the selection of positions such that between any two consecutive selected positions, the distance is <= m. Because if two positions are m apart, then each of the m windows in between will have at least one selected position.

So the problem reduces to selecting a set of positions where consecutive positions are at most m apart. But how to select the lex smallest possible multiset of characters.

The lex smallest possible result is the sorted list of the characters at the selected positions. So the problem is to select the minimal possible multiset (sorted) such that the positions of those characters form a covering set (every window of m consecutive positions has at least one selected).

Thus, the approach is to find the minimal possible multiset (sorted) of characters, which can be achieved by selecting the earliest possible occurrences of the smallest characters, ensuring that their positions are spaced such that no two consecutive are more than m apart.

So the problem is similar to interval covering, but with the aim to collect the minimal lex characters.

But how to model this.

Another approach: since the final multiset is sorted, the lex smallest possible is the combination of the earliest possible smallest characters. So for example, if there's a character 'a' available in the string, we want as many 'a's as possible (but only if they can be part of a valid covering set). Then, if we need more characters, we take the next smallest possible, etc.

So the algorithm should first count the frequencies of each character in the optimal selection. Then, the answer is the sorted list of these characters.

But how to find the minimal possible multiset.

Let me think step by step.

We need to select positions such that:

1. Every window of m consecutive positions has at least one selected position.

2. The multiset of characters at selected positions, when sorted, is lex smallest possible.

So the problem is to choose a covering set S, such that the sorted list of s[i] for i in S is lex smallest.

The lex order of the multiset is determined by the characters sorted in non-decreasing order. So the minimal possible multiset is the one that uses as many small characters as possible.

So the strategy is to greedily select the smallest possible characters first, as long as their selection allows the remaining positions to form a covering set.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach: For each possible candidate character c (starting from 'a' to 'z'), determine the maximum number of c's that can be used in the optimal solution. Once we have the maximum count for c, subtract that from the required selection and proceed to the next character.

But how to compute the maximum possible count of c's that can be used, given the coverage constraints.

Alternatively, for each character c, we can try to select as many c's as possible, ensuring that the positions of these c's form a covering set (i.e., between any two consecutive selected c's, there's a distance of at most m). If the positions of these c's form a valid covering set, then we can use all of them and return the sorted list. Otherwise, we need to mix in some higher characters.

Wait, but even if the c's are not sufficient to cover all the windows, perhaps combining them with higher characters can give a better lex result. For example, in the second sample input:

Input is 2, 'abcab'. Output is 'aab'.

The selection is positions 0,1,3 (a, b, a). So the a's are at positions 0,1,3. The window [0,1] has 0 and 1. Window [1,2] has 1. Window [2,3] has 3. Window [3,4] has 3. So the selected a's and b's (but actually, the selection includes a, b, a. Wait, the sorted list is aab. So the problem is that the minimal lex is achieved by taking the earliest a's and then some others.

So in this case, even though the first two a's are at positions 0 and 3, but m=2. Wait, 0 and 3 are 3 apart, which is larger than m=2. So the consecutive a's would leave a gap. But in this case, the selection includes a third a at position 1, which allows coverage.

Hmm, maybe the approach is to model the selection as follows:

We need to select positions such that any two consecutive positions in the selected set are at most m apart. Because if two selected positions are more than m apart, then there exists a window in between that isn't covered. Wait, no. For example, if two selected positions are i and j where j = i + m, then the windows that start at i+1, i+2, etc. up to j - m +1 may not include any selected positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that between any two consecutive selected positions, the distance is at most m. Because then, any window between them will have at least one selected position.

Wait, let's suppose we have two selected positions i and j, where j - i > m. Then, the window starting at j - m +1 would end at j. So j is included. But the window starting at i+1 would end at i + m, which is j - (j - i - m) ?

Not sure. Let's take an example. Let's say m=3. If selected positions are 0 and 4 (distance 4). The windows are:

0-2 (covers 0)

1-3 (no selected positions here)

2-4 (covers 4)

So the window 1-3 is not covered, which violates the condition. Hence, the distance between consecutive selected positions must not exceed m. So in this example, the distance is 4, which is more than m=3. Hence, the window 1-3 is uncovered. Therefore, the maximum allowed distance between consecutive selected positions is m.

Wait, but in the previous example where selected positions are 0,3,6 for m=3, the distance is 3, which is equal to m, and the windows are covered. So the maximum allowed is m, not m-1.

Ah, right. So the condition is that between any two consecutive selected positions, the distance is <= m. Because if it's exactly m, then the window that starts at (i+1) and ends at (i+1 + m -1) = i+1 + m-1 = i + m. The selected position is at i + m, which is included in that window. So that window is covered.

So the rule is that consecutive selected positions must be at most m apart. Thus, the problem becomes selecting a subset of positions where consecutive positions are at most m apart, and the multiset of their characters is lex smallest possible.

So the problem is to select such a subset, and then arrange the characters in sorted order.

The key challenge is to select the lex smallest possible multiset, which is the same as choosing as many small characters as possible, in the earliest possible positions.

An approach that comes to mind is to model this as a greedy algorithm where, for each possible character starting from 'a', we try to include as many as possible in the selection, ensuring that the coverage condition is satisfied.

So here's an outline of the approach:

1. For each character c in 'a' to 'z':

   a. Find the earliest positions where c occurs, such that between any two consecutive selected positions, the distance is <= m.

   b. Check if the selected positions cover the entire string.

   c. If possible, collect all these c's, and then proceed to the remaining parts of the string (the gaps between the c's) to select the minimal possible characters.

But this seems a bit vague. Let's think in terms of the maximum number of c's we can include. For example, if the string has a lot of 'a's spaced such that their positions are at most m apart, then selecting all those 'a's would be optimal, and we don't need any other characters. But if some gaps between 'a's are larger than m, then we need to insert some other characters in between.

Alternatively, the problem can be split into two parts:

- Determine the minimal set of characters (sorted) that can cover the entire string with their positions.

- Among all possible such sets, choose the lex smallest one.

But how to model this.

An alternative idea: The optimal solution is to select the minimal possible set of characters (sorted) such that their positions form a covering set. To find this, we can model the selection as follows:

We need to choose a set S of positions such that:

1. The selected positions cover all m-length windows.

2. The multiset of characters in S, when sorted, is lex smallest possible.

So the problem reduces to selecting the lex smallest possible multiset of characters that can form a covering set.

To find the lex smallest multiset, we can greedily select the smallest possible character first, as many as possible, then the next smallest, etc.

So the algorithm could proceed as:

- Iterate over characters from 'a' to 'z'.

- For each character c, determine the maximum number of c's that can be selected, given that their positions must form a covering set (i.e., consecutive positions are <= m apart), and that after selecting those c's, the remaining parts (the gaps between the selected c's) can be filled with higher characters to form a covering set.

But this seems complicated.

Another approach: Find the minimal possible characters in the multiset. For example, the earliest possible positions where the minimal character (say, 'a') can be placed such that their positions cover the entire string. If such positions exist, then the minimal lex is all 'a's. If not, then some 'a's and 'b's, etc.

But how to determine this.

Alternatively, the optimal solution is formed by selecting all occurrences of the smallest character possible, as long as they are spaced in a way that covers the entire string. If they can't cover the entire string, then we need to add some higher characters.

This suggests that the problem can be broken down into two parts:

1. Find the earliest positions where a character 'a' can be placed to form a covering set. If possible, then the answer is all 'a's sorted.

2. If not, find the minimal combination of 'a's and higher characters.

But how to model this.

Let's think about the first sample input:

m=3, s=cbabc.

The positions are 0: 'c', 1: 'b', 2: 'a', 3: 'b', 4: 'c'.

We need to select positions such that every window of 3 consecutive positions has at least one selected. The 'a' is at position 2. The window 0-2 (indices 0,1,2) includes 2. The window 1-3 (indices 1,2,3) includes 2. The window 2-4 (indices 2,3,4) includes 2. So selecting just position 2 (the 'a') is sufficient. So the minimal solution is 'a'.

So in this case, selecting the earliest possible 'a' (position 2) covers all windows.

Another example: the second sample input.

m=2, s=abcab.

The string is a, b, c, a, b.

The output is aab.

The selected positions are 0,1,3. The characters are 'a', 'b', 'a'. Sorted gives aab.

The coverage:

Windows are [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4].

Selected positions 0 is in window 0-1.

Position 1 is in window 1-2.

Position 3 is in window 2-3 (since m=2, window 2-3 is positions 2 and 3. 3 is selected). And window 3-4 includes 3.

So the coverage is achieved.

But why not select more 'a's? The earliest 'a's are at 0 and 3. The distance between 0 and 3 is 3, which is greater than m=2. So between them, the window 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) is not covered by either 0 or 3. So to cover that, we need to select another position in window 1-2. The minimal possible character here is 'b' (position 1) or 'c' (position 2). So selecting 1 (b) and 3 (a) would allow coverage.

But the selected positions are 0,1,3. The 0 and 1 are consecutive (distance 1 <= 2). Then 1 to 3 is distance 2 <= 2. So the coverage is achieved.

But why include position 0 here? Because if we select 0, 1, 3, the multiset is a, b, a → sorted as aab. Which is better than selecting 1 and 3, which would give a and a, but perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, if we select positions 1 and 3, the distance between them is 2 (m=2). Then, the windows would be:

0-1: includes 1.

1-2: includes 1.

2-3: includes 3.

3-4: includes 3.

But the window 0-1 is covered by 1, but the window 0-1 is the first window. So that's okay. Wait, but the selected positions must cover all possible windows. So if m=2 and the string is 5 characters, the windows are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.

So selecting 1 and 3 would cover:

window 0-1: includes 1 → covered.

window 1-2: includes 1 → covered.

window 2-3: includes 3 → covered.

window 3-4: includes 3 → covered.

So why not select positions 1 and 3, which gives the multiset 'b' and 'a' → sorted as ab. But the sample output is aab, which is lex smaller.

Ah, right. Because the problem allows selecting more positions than necessary, as long as the coverage is met. So selecting 0,1,3 gives more 'a's, which when sorted gives aab, which is better.

So the approach is not just to select the minimal number of positions required, but to select as many small characters as possible, even if that requires more positions.

Therefore, the key is to select as many small characters as possible, provided that their positions are in a way that covers all m-length windows.

So how can we model this?

Perhaps the algorithm is:

1. For each character c starting from 'a' to 'z':

   a. Collect all the positions where the character is c.

   b. Check if selecting these positions, possibly adding more positions of c, can form a valid covering set.

   c. Then, determine if there are gaps between these positions that can be filled with other instances of c to maximize the count of c in the selected set.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, the approach is similar to the classical interval covering problem, but here the covering is the entire string with overlapping intervals, and the selected positions must cover all these intervals. The goal is to select positions with the lex smallest multiset.

An alternative approach is inspired by the greedy interval covering algorithm. For the classical problem where you need to select the minimal number of points to cover all intervals, you select the earliest possible end of each interval.

But here, the goal is not to minimize the number of selected positions but to maximize the number of small characters. So perhaps, for each interval (window), we need to select the leftmost possible position that has the smallest possible character.

Wait, but the windows are overlapping. Let me think.

Each window is of length m. So the first window is positions 0 to m-1. We need to select at least one position in this window.

To get the lex smallest multiset, it's optimal to select the smallest character in this window, and among those, the earliest occurrence.

But once a position is selected in this window, it can cover subsequent windows as well.

For example, if the first window is 0-2 (m=3), and we select position 2 (the earliest 'a'), then this selection covers the first window (0-2), the second window (1-3), and the third window (2-4). So selecting the 'a' at position 2 is sufficient to cover all these windows.

But if we have a later window that doesn't include any of the selected positions, then we need to select a position in that window.

So this suggests a greedy approach where for each window that is not yet covered, select the smallest possible character in the window, and the rightmost occurrence of that character in the window. Because selecting the rightmost occurrence allows covering more subsequent windows.

Wait, this is similar to the interval covering algorithm where selecting the earliest end of the interval allows covering more intervals. But here, selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in the window allows covering as many subsequent windows as possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Initialize the current position to 0.

2. While current position < len(s):

   a. Find the next window starting at current position.

   b. In this window (from current to current + m -1), find the smallest character.

   c. Among all positions in this window where the character is the smallest, select the rightmost one. This allows covering as many subsequent windows as possible.

   d. Add this position to the selected set.

   e. Update current to the position + 1 (since the next window must start after this position's window).

But why the rightmost occurrence? Because selecting the rightmost occurrence allows covering more windows. For example, if the window is 0-2, and the smallest character is at 2, selecting 2 covers windows up to 2. Then, the next window starts at 1. But since 2 is part of window 1-3, it's already covered. So this approach would allow selecting as few positions as possible, but perhaps not maximize the number of small characters.

But our goal is to select as many small characters as possible. So perhaps, in each window, we should select the earliest occurrence of the smallest character in the window, thus leaving more room for other small characters in later windows.

Alternatively, this is tricky. Let's think with an example.

Example 2: m=2, s=abcab → positions 0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:a, 4:b.

The windows are [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4].

The optimal selection is 0,1,3.

If we use the greedy approach of selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in each window:

First window [0,1]. The smallest character is 'a' at 0 and 0 is the leftmost. So select 0. Then, current becomes 1 (next window starts at 1). Next window [1,2]. The smallest character is 'b' at 1. Select the rightmost occurrence (1). Current becomes 2. Next window [2,3]. The smallest character is 'a' at 3. Select 3. Current becomes 4. Next window [3,4], which is covered by 3. So selected positions are 0,1,3. The characters are a, b, a → sorted as aab. Which matches the sample. So this approach works.

But how does this approach ensure that we collect as many small characters as possible.

Alternatively, the greedy approach of selecting the smallest possible character in the current window, and the rightmost occurrence of that character, allows us to cover as many windows as possible, thereby reducing the number of positions needed, but perhaps allowing more small characters to be selected in other windows.

Another example: third sample input:

Input is m=3, s=bcabcbaccba → output is aaabb.

Let's see. The string is:

Indices: 0: b, 1:c, 2:a, 3:b, 4:c, 5:b, 6:a, 7:c, 8:c, 9:b, 10:a.

m=3.

The windows are:

[0,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5], [4,5,6], [5,6,7], [6,7,8], [7,8,9], [8,9,10].

The optimal selected positions are those that have the earliest possible a's and some b's.

The output is 'aaabb', which suggests that there are three a's and two b's.

Let's see:

The first window [0,1,2]. The smallest character is a at 2. Select 2. Next window starts at 3 (since 2 is part of windows 0-2, 1-3, 2-4). So the next window to process is 3 (current = 3). The next window [3,4,5]. The smallest character is b at 3. So select 3. Then current becomes 4. Next window [4,5,6]. The smallest character is a at 6. Select 6. current becomes 7. Next window [7,8,9]. The smallest character is b at 9. Select 9. current becomes 10. Next window [10, ...] but it's beyond the string. So selected positions are 2,3,6,9. But the sample output is 'aaabb'. So perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe the algorithm is different.

Hmm, perhaps in this case, the selected positions are 2,3,6,8,9,10? Or maybe there's a better way to select more a's.

But the sample output has 3 a's and 2 b's. So the selected positions must include three a's.

So in the string, the a's are at positions 2, 6, and 10.

If we select positions 2,6,10, then the distance between them is 4 and 4, which is larger than m=3. So between 2 and 6, the distance is 4, which would require additional selections. For example, between 2 and 6, there are three windows: 3-5 (positions 3,4,5), 4-6 (positions 4,5,6), etc. So selecting 2,6,10 would leave some windows uncovered. Hence, additional positions must be selected.

So the algorithm must select positions to cover all windows.

Thus, the problem is more complex than just selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in each window.

Perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:

We need to find the minimal possible multiset of characters (sorted) that can cover all m-length windows. To do this, we can process the string from left to right, greedily selecting the earliest possible smallest characters that allow the rest of the string to be covered.

But how to implement this.

Another idea comes from the problem's requirement that the selected positions must form a covering set, which is equivalent to the selected positions forming a sequence where any two consecutive positions are at most m apart.

Wait, no. Because the selected positions can be anywhere, but each consecutive pair must be at most m apart. Because if they are more than m apart, then there's a window between them that is not covered. So the selected positions must form a sequence where each consecutive pair is at most m apart.

So the problem reduces to selecting a sequence of positions i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k such that i_{j+1} - i_j <= m for all j, and also the first position is <= m-1 (so that the first window is covered), and the last position is >= len(s) - m (so that the last window is covered).

But how to model the selection of these positions to get the lex smallest multiset.

An alternative approach is to model the selection as a dynamic programming problem, where for each position, we track the minimal possible multiset (sorted) of characters selected up to that position, considering the coverage constraints.

But given the constraints (n up to 1e5), a DP approach is not feasible due to time and memory limitations.

Thus, we need a greedy approach.

Another observation: the optimal multiset is the sorted list of all characters at the selected positions. To minimize this list, we want as many small characters as possible, even if that means selecting more positions.

Thus, the problem can be viewed as a priority queue problem where, for each possible position, we track the minimal character that can be selected, ensuring coverage.

But how.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem of selecting the minimal number of positions to cover all intervals:

- For each position i in the string, determine the earliest position j >= i such that all windows starting before j must be covered.

But this isn't directly helpful.

Another angle: the selected positions must form a sequence where each consecutive pair is <= m apart. To cover the entire string, the first position must be <= m-1 (so that the first window is covered), the next position must be <= first position + m, and so on.

So the problem is to select such a sequence of positions, and the multiset of their characters is lex smallest possible.

The lex smallest multiset is the sorted list of these characters. To minimize this, we need to select as many small characters as possible.

Thus, the algorithm should select the earliest possible occurrence of the smallest possible character in each possible segment, ensuring that the selected positions are no more than m apart.

So here's a possible approach:

1. Start from position 0. The next position can be up to 0 + m.

2. In the range [current position, current + m], select the earliest occurrence of the smallest possible character. This allows us to cover up to that position + m.

3. Repeat this process until the end of the string.

Wait, but this may not capture the optimal selection. For example, selecting a slightly later position but with a smaller character could allow for more small characters to be selected in the future.

Alternatively, the optimal strategy is to select the smallest possible character in the current window of possible positions (current to current + m), and among those, the one that allows the maximum coverage (i.e., the furthest possible occurrence of the smallest character). This way, we can cover more positions in the future and possibly include more small characters.

So, the algorithm is:

- Initialize current position to 0.

- While current < len(s):

   a. Find the furthest position in [current, current + m - 1] that has the smallest possible character.

   b. Select that position.

   c. Set current to the selected position + m (since the next window starts at selected position + 1, but after selecting a position at i, the next window must start at i + 1. Wait, no. The next window must be covered by a selected position within i+1 to i + m).

But this is getting complicated.

Let me try to model this with code.

For example, in the first sample:

m=3, s=cbabc.

The initial current is 0. The window is [0, 1, 2]. The characters are 'c', 'b', 'a'. The smallest character is 'a' at position 2. Select position 2. Now, current becomes 3 (since the next window starts at 2 +1 =3. But the selected position is 2. So the next possible window is 3, but since the selected position is 2, the next window must start at 3. However, the selected position 2 is part of windows 0-2, 1-3, 2-4. So after selecting 2, the next position to start is 3, but the next window is 1-3 (already covered by 2). So the algorithm would end here, but the string has 5 characters, and the windows up to 2+3-1=4.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm should find the next position after the current selected position plus m, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after selecting a position i, the next position to cover is i + 1. Because the next window starts at i - m + 2 (but this is not clear).

Alternatively, after selecting position i, the next possible position can be up to i + m. Because the selected position i covers windows up to i. The next selected position must be <= i + m to ensure coverage between i and i + m.

This is getting a bit stuck.

Another idea is to model the problem as follows:

The selected positions must form a sequence where each consecutive pair is <= m apart. So the first position must be <= m-1. Then, the next position must be <= first position + m. And so on, until the end.

But the end of the string is len(s) - 1. The last selected position must be >= len(s) - m.

So, to cover the entire string, the selected positions must form a sequence that starts no later than m-1, each consecutive pair at most m apart, and ends at or after len(s) - m.

The lex smallest multiset is formed by selecting the smallest possible characters in these positions.

Thus, the problem is to select a sequence of positions that satisfies these constraints, and the multiset of their characters is lex smallest possible.

But how to select such a sequence.

This feels like a problem that can be modeled using a greedy algorithm, where at each step, we select the smallest possible character in the current allowable range, and the furthest possible occurrence of that character to maximize coverage.

So here's an algorithm outline:

Initialize:

- current = 0 (the earliest possible start of the next selected position).

- selected = empty list.

- last_selected = -infinity.

Loop:

While current < len(s):

   a. Determine the window of possible positions: from current to min(current + m -1, len(s)-1).

   b. In this window, find the smallest character.

   c. Among all positions in this window with that smallest character, select the rightmost one (to cover as many subsequent positions as possible).

   d. Add this position to selected.

   e. Update current to the selected position + 1.

   f. Update last_selected to the selected position.

The idea is that by choosing the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in the current window, we cover as much as possible, allowing us to skip over more positions and possibly select smaller characters in later steps.

Wait, let's test this algorithm with the first sample.

Sample 1:

m=3, s=cbabc (indices 0-4).

current =0.

window is 0-2. The characters are c, b, a. The smallest is a at position 2. Add to selected. current becomes 3.

current=3: window is 3-4 (since current + m-1 =3+2=5, which is beyond len(s)-1=4). So window is 3-4.

Characters are b and c. smallest is b at 3. Select rightmost occurrence in window (3). current becomes 4.

current=4: window is 4-4. character c. select it. current becomes5.

Now, current >= len(s), so loop ends.

selected positions are 2,3,4. characters a, b, c → sorted as abc. But the sample output is a.

But this is wrong. So clearly, the algorithm is not correct.

Wait, but the sample solution selected only position 2. The algorithm's selection of 2,3,4 would also cover all windows. But why would the algorithm select 3 and 4?

Ah, because after selecting 2, the current is set to 3 (selected position +1). The next window is 3-5 (but len(s) is5, so 3-4). Select the smallest character in that window (b and c → b is smallest). So position 3 is selected. Then current is 4. The next window is 4-6 (but only 4). Select position4. So the selected positions are 2,3,4. But the coverage is achieved with just 2. So this algorithm is not optimal.

Thus, the algorithm's approach of selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in the current window is not correct, as it leads to selecting more positions than necessary and larger characters in the multiset.

So why does this algorithm fail? Because in the first step, the algorithm selects 2, which covers all possible windows. The next steps are unnecessary. But the algorithm proceeds to select 3 and 4, which are not needed.

So the error is in the way the current position is updated. After selecting position 2, the current should be set to 2 + m (since the selected position 2 covers up to 2 + m -1 =2+3-1=4. So the next window starts at 2+1=3. But after selecting position 2, all windows up to 4 are covered. So the next window to process should be 5, which is beyond the string. So the algorithm should terminate after selecting 2.

Ah, right. So the current should be updated to the selected position + m. Because the selected position i can cover all windows that include it. The next window that needs to be covered is the one that starts at i + m.

Thus, the correct algorithm should:

After selecting a position i, the next window starts at i + m. Because the current selected position covers all windows up to i + m -1. So the next window to cover is i + m.

But wait, if the selected position is i, then the next possible window that is not covered is i + m, which starts at i + m and ends at i + m + m-1 = i + 2m -1. But this is only if i + m is within the string.

So, the algorithm should be:

Initialize current =0.

While current < len(s):

   a. The window is from current to min(current + m -1, len(s)-1).

   b. Find the smallest character in this window.

   c. Among all positions in this window with that character, select the rightmost one (to allow covering more windows).

   d. Add this position to the selected list.

   e. Update current to the selected position + m.

This way, after selecting a position i, the next window starts at i + m, because i can cover up to i + m -1.

Let's test this with sample 1:

m=3, s=cbabc (length 5).

current =0. window is 0-2. Smallest character 'a' at 2. Select 2. current becomes 2 +3=5. Loop ends. Selected positions are [2]. Characters are a. Sorted is a → correct.

Sample 2:

m=2, s=abcab (length 5).

current=0. window 0-1. smallest is 'a' at0. select rightmost 'a' (0). current becomes 0+2=2.

current=2. window is 2-3. smallest character is 'a' at3. select3. current becomes 3+2=5. loop ends. selected positions are 0 and3. characters are a and a → sorted 'aa'. But the sample output is 'aab'. So this approach is not correct.

But wait, the selected positions 0 and 3 are spaced 3 apart. m=2. So consecutive selected positions are 0 and3, distance is3>2. Thus, the coverage is not achieved. For example, the window starting at 2 (positions 2 and3) would include 3. The window starting at 1 (1,2) would not be covered by any selected positions. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, right. Because in this case, the algorithm selected positions 0 and3. The distance between them is3, which is larger than m=2. Hence, the window starting at 1 (positions1 and2) is not covered.

Thus, the algorithm's approach of selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character and then jumping m steps is incorrect, as it may leave gaps between the selected positions.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. So the problem is that the algorithm doesn't ensure that the selected positions are spaced at most m-1 apart. Because if two selected positions are spaced more than m-1 apart, then there are windows between them that are not covered.

Thus, the correct approach must ensure that selected positions are no more than m-1 apart.

But how to model this.

Another idea: The selected positions must form a sequence where each consecutive pair is at most m-1 apart. Because if two positions are m apart, then the window between them would have a length of m, but not including either position.

For example, positions i and i+m. The window starting at i+1 and ending at i+m (length m) would include neither i nor i+m. So this window is not covered.

Thus, the selected positions must be such that each consecutive pair is at most m-1 apart. So the algorithm should ensure that the next selected position is within m-1 of the previous one.

But how to greedily select the smallest characters while maintaining this constraint.

This seems like a problem that can be approached with a sliding window.

Here's a possible approach:

- Maintain a sliding window that represents the next possible position to select. The window starts at the current position and spans up to m positions ahead (i.e., from current to current + m -1).

- In this window, select the smallest possible character, and among those, the rightmost occurrence. This allows us to cover as many future windows as possible.

- Add this position to the selected list, and set the current to the selected position +1. Repeat until the end of the string is covered.

Let's test this with sample 2:

Sample 2:

m=2, s=abcab → positions 0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:a,4:b.

current=0.

window is 0-0+2-1=0-1. The window is [0,1]. The smallest character is 'a' at0. Among the 'a's in this window, the rightmost is 0. Select 0. current becomes 0+1=1.

Now, current=1. window is 1-1+1=1-2 (since m=2, 1+2-1=2). The window is [1,2]. The smallest character is 'b' at1 and 'c' at2. The smallest is 'b' at1. Select 1. current becomes 2.

window is 2-3. The smallest character is 'a' at3. Select 3. current becomes4.

window is4-5 (but 4+1=5 is beyond the string). The window is4. The character is 'b'. Select4. current becomes5.

Now, selected positions are 0,1,3,4. characters are a, b, a, b. Sorted is aab b → 'aabb'. But the sample output is 'aab', which is lex smaller.

Thus, this approach is not optimal. So the problem is that this approach selects more positions than necessary, leading to a larger multiset.

So the algorithm is incorrect.

But what's the correct way to model this?

Perhaps the key is to realize that the minimal lex multiset is achieved by selecting the earliest possible small characters, even if it means selecting more positions. But how to model this.

Another observation: the optimal selection of positions must be such that between any two consecutive positions, there is no gap larger than m-1. So the first position must be in [0, m-1], the second must be within [first +1, first + m], etc.

Thus, the problem is to select a sequence of positions covering the entire string, with each consecutive pair at most m-1 apart, and the multiset of characters is lex smallest possible.

To find the lex smallest multiset, we need to select as many small characters as possible, even if that requires selecting more positions. For example, selecting two 'a's and one 'b' is better than selecting one 'a' and two 'b's.

Thus, the algorithm must select the earliest possible small characters, even if they are close together, to allow for more small characters in the multiset.

But how to implement this.

An alternative approach inspired by the problem of finding the minimal lex string under certain constraints is to model this as a priority queue that tracks the best possible options.

For example, we can model the selection as a greedy choice at each step:

At each step, find the smallest possible character in the current window (current to current + m -1), and select the earliest occurrence of that character. This allows us to proceed to the next window (current = selected position +1) and select more small characters.

Let's test this with sample 2:

Sample 2:

m=2, s=abcab.

current=0. window is 0-1. The smallest character is 'a' at0. Select 0. current becomes0+1=1.

current=1. window is1-2. The smallest character is 'b' at1. Select 1. current becomes2.

window is2-3. The smallest character is 'a' at3. Select3. current becomes4.

window is4. Select4 (b). current becomes5.

Selected positions are0,1,3,4. characters a, b, a, b → sorted as aab b → 'aabb', which is worse than the sample's 'aab'.

But the sample's selection includes 0,1,3. Which characters are a, b, a → sorted as aab. So this approach selects more positions, leading to a worse lex order.

Thus, this approach is not correct.

So what's the problem here? The algorithm is selecting the earliest occurrence of the smallest character in each window. But this leads to selecting more positions than necessary, and possibly higher characters.

In the sample, the selected positions 0,1,3 cover all windows:

- Windows [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4].

- Selected 0 covers [0,1].

- Selected 1 covers [1,2].

- Selected3 covers [2,3] (since m=2, window [2,3] includes position3) and [3,4].

Thus, the selection of 0,1,3 is sufficient. But how to model this.

Another idea is to find all possible positions where the character is the smallest possible, and arrange them in such a way that they form a covering set.

For example, in sample 2, the 'a's are at 0 and3. The 'b's are at 1 and4. The 'c' is at2.

We need to select positions that include 0 and3, but the gap between them is3. m=2. So between0 and3, there's a gap of3 positions. So the distance is3, which is larger than m-1=1. So to cover this, we need to select a position in between, say 1. But that gives us a, b, a.

This suggests that the algorithm must select positions of small characters and fill the gaps with higher characters if necessary.

Thus, the approach is to select the minimal possible characters and fill the gaps with the minimal possible higher characters.

But how to model this.

This feels like a problem that requires dynamic programming. But with n up to 1e5, a DP approach with O(n) time might be possible.

But what would the DP state be?

Perhaps, for each position i, we track the minimal lex multiset of characters that can be selected up to i, with the last selected position at j (where j >= i -m +1).

But this is not feasible due to the high constraints.

Alternative idea: To find the minimal lex multiset, we can greedily select the earliest possible occurrence of the smallest possible character, and then recursively solve the remaining part of the string.

But recursion is not feasible.

Another idea is to model the problem as a greedy selection of the smallest possible character in the current possible window, but allowing for the selection of multiple characters in the same window if that leads to a better lex multiset.

But this is unclear.

Perhaps the correct approach is to find all the positions where the character is the smallest possible in the entire string, then see if they can form a valid covering set. If not, combine with the next smallest character.

For example:

1. Find all positions where the character is 'a'. Check if these positions form a valid covering set (i.e., consecutive positions are no more than m-1 apart, and the first and last positions cover the start and end of the string).

If yes, then the answer is all 'a's.

If no, then the answer is a combination of 'a's and 'b's, and so on.

This approach is feasible but requires checking for each character.

But how to check whether a set of positions covers all windows.

Another way to check if a set of positions covers all m-length windows is:

- The first position must be <= m-1.

- The last position must be >= len(s) - m.

- For any two consecutive positions i and j in the set, j -i <= m-1.

Additionally, all positions between the first and last must be covered.

So, the algorithm could be:

For c in 'a' to 'z':

   a. Collect all positions where s[i] <=c.

   b. Check if these positions form a valid covering set (as per the three conditions above).

   c. If yes, then among all such possible selections, find the minimal possible multiset.

But this seems computationally expensive.

Alternatively, find the minimal lex character c such that the set of positions of c (and lower) can form a covering set.

But again, how to model this.

Another possible approach is to realize that the optimal solution will consist of a set of characters c, where the first k characters are the smallest possible, and the rest are higher. For example, the solution may consist of some 'a's and 'b's, but no higher characters.

Thus, the algorithm can be:

For each character c from 'a' to 'z':

   a. Find all positions where s[i] <=c.

   b. Check if these positions can form a valid covering set (i.e., every m-length window contains at least one of these positions).

   c. If yes, then the minimal solution is the sorted list of the minimal possible multiset of characters <=c.

   d. The minimal multiset can be found by selecting the earliest possible positions of the smallest possible characters, while ensuring coverage.

But how to efficiently check step b and find the minimal multiset.

To check step b, we can process the positions of characters <=c in sorted order, and check if they are spaced no more than m-1 apart, and cover the entire string.

For example, if the positions are sorted in increasing order, then:

- The first position must be <=m-1.

- The last position must be >= len(s) - m.

- Between consecutive positions, the difference must be <=m-1.

If all these conditions are met, then the positions form a valid covering set.

Thus, for a given c, the steps are:

1. Collect all positions where s[i] <=c, sorted in increasing order.

2. Check if the first position is <=m-1.

3. Check if the last position is >= len(s) - m.

4. Check that between any two consecutive positions, the difference is <=m-1.

If all these conditions are met, then the answer is possible with characters <=c.

Once we find the smallest c for which this is possible, the next step is to find the minimal multiset of characters <=c that forms a covering set.

But how to find this minimal multiset.

The minimal multiset would consist of as many small characters as possible. For example, if we can select 'a's and 'b's, but 'a's are better, then we would select as many 'a's as possible, and fill the remaining gaps with 'b's.

Thus, for the found c, we can greedily select as many as possible of the smallest characters (starting from 'a') and fill the gaps with higher characters.

Thus, the algorithm would proceed as:

- Find the smallest c for which the positions of characters <=c can form a valid covering set.

- For this c, greedily select the minimal possible multiset by selecting as many small characters as possible.

But this is quite involved.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Find the smallest possible c such that the positions of characters <=c can form a valid covering set.

This can be done via binary search on the characters from 'a' to 'z'.

For each candidate c, collect all positions where s[i] <=c, sorted, and check if they form a valid covering set.

Once we find the smallest c for which this is possible, proceed to the next step.

2. For this c, select a subset of positions (including positions with characters <=c) that form a valid covering set, and the multiset of their characters is lex smallest possible.

To select the lex smallest multiset, we need to select as many of the smallest possible characters (i.e., 'a's first, then 'b's, etc.) as possible, ensuring that the covering set conditions are met.

This can be done via a greedy approach:

- Iterate through the string from left to right.

- Whenever possible, select the smallest possible character in the current window, and the rightmost occurrence of that character to maximize coverage.

But this is similar to the earlier algorithm.

Alternatively, for the selected c, we can generate the minimal multiset by:

a. Starting from position 0, find the earliest possible position in [current, current + m -1] where the character is as small as possible, but <=c.

b. Select the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in this window.

c. Update current to selected position + m.

But this may not work.

Alternatively, using the same algorithm as before, but restricted to characters <=c.

But perhaps this can be optimized.

Let's consider the sample 2 again.

After finding that c is 'b' (since 'a' positions are [0,3], which are spaced 3 apart, which for m=2 is invalid), we need to select a covering set including 'a's and 'b's.

The positions <= 'b' are 0,1,3,4.

These positions sorted are [0,1,3,4].

Check conditions:

- first position 0 <=1 (m-1=1) → ok.

- last position 4 >=5-2=3 → ok.

- Consecutive differences: 1-0=1 <=1 → ok. 3-1=2 >1 → invalid. So the positions do not form a valid covering set. Thus, adding 'b's may not help.

Wait, but in sample 2, the correct answer uses 'a's and 'b's. How is that possible?

Ah, perhaps my approach is incorrect. The positions of characters <=c may not form a valid covering set, but the algorithm may require combining characters <=c with some higher characters.

Wait, no. Because once we select c as the minimal character for which the positions of characters <=c can form a valid covering set, then we can include those characters and higher ones are not needed.

But sample 2's correct answer includes 'a's and 'b's. So the minimal c is 'b'. But the positions of characters <= 'b' are 0,1,3,4. The problem is that 1 and3 are 2 apart. m=2, so maximum allowed is 1. So consecutive positions must be <=1 apart. Thus, this set is invalid.

But sample 2's answer uses positions 0,1,3. The characters are 'a', 'b', 'a'. The positions are 0,1,3.

The differences between consecutive positions are 1 (0 to1) and 2 (1 to3). The distance 2 is > m-1=1, so this should be invalid. But in reality, the selected positions must form a covering set. How does this work?

Because the selected positions 0,1,3 cover all windows of length 2.

Windows are [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4].

- [0,1] has 0 and1.

- [1,2] has 1.

- [2,3] has3.

- [3,4] has3.

Thus, all windows are covered. So even though the distance between 1 and3 is 2, which is larger than m-1=1, the covering is achieved.

This suggests that the previous approach of checking consecutive positions is incorrect. Because the selected positions can be non-consecutive but spaced in a way that allows overlapping windows to be covered.

Thus, the earlier condition (consecutive positions must be no more than m-1 apart) is not correct. This is a critical realization.

The correct condition is that every window of m consecutive positions contains at least one selected position. This is different from the consecutive positions being no more than m-1 apart.

For example, in sample 2, the selected positions are 0,1,3. The distance between 1 and3 is 2, but in the windows:

- [1,2] has position1.

- [2,3] has position3.

Thus, all windows are covered.

So the earlier approach of checking consecutive positions' distances is incorrect.

Thus, the correct approach must model the coverage of all windows, not just the consecutive positions' distances.

This complicates the problem.

Thus, the previous approaches are not sufficient, and a new strategy is needed.

The correct way to ensure coverage of all windows is to have at least one selected position in each window of m consecutive positions.

Thus, the problem is to select a subset of positions such that for every possible window of m consecutive positions, at least one is selected. The goal is to find the subset with the lex smallest possible multiset of characters (sorted).

To model this, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate through the string and for each window, select the smallest possible character that allows coverage of that window and future windows.

But how to do this efficiently.

An efficient way to model this is to use a sliding window approach:

For each position i from 0 to len(s) - m:

   a. Ensure that the window [i, i + m -1] has at least one selected position.

But this is not helpful directly.

Another approach inspired by the problem's constraints is to track the earliest position that needs to be covered. We can greedily select the best possible position for each required window.

For example:

Initialize the earliest position that needs to be covered as 0.

While there are positions to cover:

   a. Find the smallest character in the current window [earliest, earliest + m -1].

   b. Among the positions in this window with that character, select the rightmost one to cover as many future windows as possible.

   c. Add this position to the selected list.

   d. Set the new earliest position to (selected position) +1.

This approach ensures that each window is processed once, and the best possible character is selected for each required window.

Let's test this with sample 2:

Sample 2:

m=2.

earliest=0. window is [0,1]. The smallest character is 'a' at0. Select the rightmost occurrence of 'a' in this window, which is0. Add to selected. earliest becomes0+1=1.

Now, earliest=1. window is [1,2]. The smallest character is 'b' at1. Select1. earliest becomes2.

earliest=2. window is [2,3]. The smallest character is 'a' at3. Select3. earliest becomes4.

earliest=4. window is [4,5] (but len(s) is5, so window is4). Select4. earliest becomes5.

Selected positions are0,1,3,4 → characters a, b, a, b → sorted aabb. But the sample output is aab. So this approach is not correct.

But why? Because the sample output selects positions0,1,3. This covers all windows.

Thus, the algorithm's approach is selecting more positions than needed.

The problem is that selecting the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in the current window may lead to overlapping coverage, but it's possible to select fewer positions with a better multiset.

Thus, the algorithm is not optimal.

So, what's the correct way to model this?

Another idea is to realize that once a position is selected, it covers all windows that include it. Thus, the selection should be made to cover as many future windows as possible.

Thus, for each window that needs to be covered, we select the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in that window. This allows covering as many future windows as possible.

Let's try this approach:

Sample 2:

earliest=0. window [0,1]. smallest is 'a' at0. rightmost 'a' is0. select0. This covers windows [0,1], and any window that includes0. The next window to cover is1+1=2 (window [1,2]).

earliest=1. window [1,2]. smallest is 'b' at1. select1. covers window [1,2]. next window is2.

earliest=2. window [2,3]. smallest is 'a' at3. select3. covers [2,3], [3,4]. next window is4+1=5. loop ends.

Selected positions are0,1,3. characters a, b, a → sorted aab → correct.

So this approach works for sample 2.

Thus, the correct algorithm is:

Initialize earliest=0.

selected = empty list.

While earliest <= len(s) - m:

   a. window is [earliest, earliest + m -1].

   b. Find the smallest character in this window.

   c. Among all positions in this window with that character, select the rightmost one.

   d. Add this position to selected.

   e. Set earliest to the selected position + 1.

Once this loop ends, check if the last selected position covers the remaining windows.

But wait, after the loop, there might be windows beyond the selected positions. For example, if the string is longer than the selected position + m -1.

But len(s) - m +1 is the number of windows. For example, if len(s) is5, m=2, there are4 windows. The loop runs until earliest is len(s) -m +1 -1? Not sure.

Alternatively, the loop should continue until earliest +m -1 < len(s). Let's re-examine.

The loop runs while earliest <= len(s) -m. Because the window [earliest, earliest +m-1] must be a valid window. The earliest can be up to len(s) -m.

For example, if len(s) is5, m=2, the last window starts at3 (positions3,4).

So the loop runs while earliest <=3.

Thus, in sample 2:

earliest starts at0.

After selecting0, earliest becomes1.

Select1, earliest becomes2.

Select3 (window [2,3]), earliest becomes4.

But len(s) -m =5-2=3. So earliest=4 is larger than3, loop ends.

Thus, the selected positions are0,1,3.

Which covers all windows.

Thus, this algorithm works for sample2.

Now, sample1:

m=3, s=cbabc (len5).

earliest=0.

window [0,2]. smallest is 'a' at2. select2. earliest becomes3. len(s)-m=5-3=2. earliest=3>2 → loop ends.

selected positions is [2], which is correct.

Sample3:

Not sure, but this approach seems promising.

Thus, the correct algorithm is:

1. Iterate over the string, for each window starting at 'earliest'.

2. In each window, find the smallest character.

3. Select the rightmost occurrence of that character in the window.

4. Add to selected list.

5. Set earliest to selected position +1.

6. Repeat until earliest exceeds len(s) -m.

After this, check if the last selected position covers the remaining windows.

But wait, what about the windows after the selected positions?

For example, if the last selected position is i, then i covers windows up to i +m -1. So if i +m -1 >= len(s) -1, then all windows are covered.

Thus, the algorithm correctly covers all windows.

This approach selects the minimal number of positions, but not the minimal lex multiset. Because it selects the smallest character in each window, and the rightmost occurrence. This ensures that each selection covers as many future windows as possible, thereby reducing the number of positions needed. But since the multiset is sorted, having fewer positions may not be optimal. But in the sample2, this approach selects three positions (0,1,3) which gives a multiset of a, b, a → sorted aab. Which is better than selecting four positions (a, b, a, b → aabb).

Thus, this approach works.

Thus, the algorithm is:

While there are windows to cover:

   a. For the current window, select the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character.

   b. Add that position to the selected list.

   c. Move to the next window after the selected position.

Thus, the selected positions form a covering set, and the multiset is the sorted list of their characters.

Thus, the code should:

- Iterate over the string, maintaining 'earliest' as the start of the current window.

- For each window, find the smallest character and the rightmost occurrence.

- Add that position to the selected list.

- Update 'earliest' to the selected position +1.

Once all windows are processed, collect the characters at the selected positions, sort them, and output.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

The key steps are:

1. For each window [earliest, earliest + m -1], find the smallest character and the rightmost occurrence of that character.

This can be done efficiently using a sliding window and a data structure that allows querying the minimum character and their rightmost occurrence in O(1) time.

But for large m (up to 1e5), we need an efficient way to find the minimum and rightmost occurrence in each window of size m.

This is challenging. A naive approach of scanning each window would result in O(nm) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.

Thus, we need a data structure that can handle sliding window minimum queries efficiently.

One possible data structure is a deque to maintain the indices of the minimum elements in the current window.

But since we need to find the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in each window, we can process the window from right to left.

Another approach is to preprocess for each position i the rightmost occurrence of the minimum character in the window starting at i.

This can be done with a sliding window approach in O(n) time.

Here's how:

Preprocess an array 'rightmost_min' where rightmost_min[i] is the index of the rightmost occurrence of the minimum character in the window [i, i+m-1].

This can be computed using a sliding window technique:

- For each i, the window [i, i+m-1].

- The minimum character is the smallest in this window.

- Among all positions in the window where the character is this minimum, rightmost_min[i] is the largest index.

To compute this, we can use a deque to track the indices in the window in a way that allows us to find the minimum and its rightmost occurrence.

Alternatively, the following steps can be used:

1. For each position i from 0 to len(s)-1:

   a. Keep track of the current window's minimum and its rightmost occurrence.

This can be done by maintaining a list of potential minima for the current window.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, process the string in reverse order.

For each position i from len(s)-1 downto 0:

   a. Keep track of the current window [i, i + m -1] (but the window must not exceed the string length).

   b. For each i, maintain the rightmost occurrence of the minimum character in the window starting at i.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the window size is fixed at m, we can precompute for each position i the minimum character in the window and its rightmost occurrence.

This can be done using a sliding window approach.

An efficient way to compute the minimum in each window of size m is to use a deque that stores indices in a way that their corresponding characters are in non-decreasing order.

But in this case, we need the minimum's rightmost occurrence, so perhaps a different approach is needed.

Here's an approach to precompute the rightmost_min array:

Initialize rightmost_min as an array of length len(s) - m + 1.

For each window starting at i:

   a. Find the minimum character in the window [i, i+m-1].

   b. Among all positions j in this window where s[j] is the minimum, select the largest j.

We can compute this using a deque that stores indices in the current window in such a way that the minimum is known.

But how to track the rightmost occurrence.

An alternative approach is to process each window from i to i+m-1 and find the minimum character and its rightmost occurrence.

But this is O(nm), which is not feasible for large m.

Thus, a more efficient approach is needed.

Another idea is to use a segment tree or a sparse table to answer range minimum queries (RMQ), and then find the rightmost occurrence of the minimum in the range.

But once the minimum is found, finding its rightmost occurrence would require scanning the range from the end to find the last occurrence of the minimum. This could be O(m) in the worst case.

Thus, this is not efficient for large m.

But for a problem with n up to 1e5, an O(n) approach is needed.

An alternative approach is to note that when processing the window [i, i+m-1], the rightmost occurrence of the minimum is either in the previous window's rightmost occurrence or in the new element added to the window.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to precompute for each position i the next occurrence of each character. But this may not be feasible.

Alternatively, for each character c from 'a' to 'z', precompute a list of positions where c occurs. Then, for each window, check if c is present, and find the rightmost position.

But this would require checking for each c in ascending order until we find the smallest c present in the window, and then find the rightmost position.

This approach would be O(n * 26), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.

Thus, here's the plan:

For each window [i, i+m-1], iterate over characters from 'a' to 'z' and check if any occurrence of that character exists in the window. For the first character that has at least one occurrence, find the rightmost position in the window and record it.

This can be done using a list of prefix sums for each character.

For example, for each character c, precompute a prefix sum array cnt_c, where cnt_c[i] is the number of occurrences of c up to position i.

Then, for a window [l, r], the number of c's in the window is cnt_c[r] - cnt_c[l-1].

For each c from 'a' to 'z':

   a. If the count is >0, then c is present in the window.

   b. The rightmost occurrence of c in the window can be found using a precomputed array last_occurrence[c][i], which gives the last occurrence of c up to position i.

But how to compute last_occurrence[c][i].

We can precompute for each position i, for each character c, the last occurrence of c up to i.

This can be done in O(n * 26) time and space.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Precompute for each character c, an array last_occurrence[c], where last_occurrence[c][i] is the last position <=i where c occurs.

This can be done by iterating over the string once, and for each character, update the last_occurrence for that character.

2. For each window [i, i+m-1], iterate c from 'a' to 'z':

   a. Check if there's any occurrence of c in the window.

   b. This can be done by checking if last_occurrence[c][i+m-1] >=i.

   c. If yes, then the rightmost occurrence is last_occurrence[c][i+m-1].

   d. Record this position as the rightmost_min for the window.

   e. Break and proceed to the next window.

This approach is O(26 * (n - m +1)), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.

Thus, this is the way to proceed.

Once we have the rightmost_min array, the algorithm can proceed as follows:

Initialize earliest=0.

selected_positions = empty list.

While earliest <= len(s) - m:

   a. current_window starts at earliest.

   b. The rightmost_min for current_window is precomputed.

   c. selected_pos = rightmost_min[current_window].

   d. add selected_pos to selected_positions.

   e. earliest = selected_pos + 1.

Once all windows are processed, collect the characters at selected_positions, sort them, and output.

This should be efficient.

Thus, the code steps are:

1. Precompute last_occurrence for each character.

2. Precompute rightmost_min for each window.

3. Iterate through the windows, selecting the rightmost_min for each window.

4. Collect the characters, sort, and output.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

First, precompute last_occurrence.

We can represent last_occurrence as a dictionary of lists for each character. But for efficiency, perhaps we can use a 2D array.

But in Python, for a string of length 1e5, and 26 characters, this would require 2.6e6 storage, which is manageable.

Thus, the steps are:

- Initialize a list of lists, last_occurrence, with 26 entries (for each character) and len(s) entries.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute for each character c, a list last_occurrence_c, where last_occurrence_c[i] is the last occurrence of c before or at i.

This can be computed as follows:

For each character c in 'a' to 'z':

   last_occurrence = [ -1 ] * len(s)

   current_last = -1

   for i in range(len(s)):

       if s[i] == c:

           current_last = i

       last_occurrence[i] = current_last

Thus, for each i, last_occurrence[i] gives the last occurrence of c up to i.

Once this is done, for any window [l, r], the last occurrence of c in this window is last_occurrence[r] if it >= l, else -1.

Then, for each window starting at i, the rightmost_min can be found by checking each character from 'a' to 'z' in order, and seeing if that character has a last_occurrence >= i in the window [i, i+m-1].

Thus, for the window [i, i+m-1], the rightmost_min[i] is the last_occurrence of the smallest character present in the window.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows.

Implementing this in Python:

Read m, s.

Precompute for each character c in 'a' to 'z', the last_occurrence array.

Then, for each window starting at i (from 0 to len(s)-m):

   for c in 'a' to 'z':

       r = i + m - 1

       last_pos = last_occurrence[ord(c)-ord('a')][r]

       if last_pos >= i:

           rightmost_min[i] = last_pos

           break

Once rightmost_min is computed.

Then, select positions:

earliest =0

selected = []

while earliest <= len(s) - m:

   window_start = earliest

   if window_start > len(s) -m:

       break

   pos = rightmost_min[window_start]

   selected.append(pos)

   earliest = pos +1

Finally, collect the characters at selected positions, sort, and print.

But wait, there's a possibility that the last window may not be covered. For example, if the selected positions do not cover the end of the string.

But according to the algorithm, the selected positions cover all windows up to len(s) -m. Once the earliest exceeds len(s) -m, the loop ends. But the remaining windows (if any) are not covered.

Wait, no. The loop runs while earliest <= len(s) -m. Because the window starts at earliest and has m positions. Thus, the loop covers all possible windows.

Once the loop ends, the selected positions cover all windows. Because each selected position is the rightmost occurrence of the smallest character in its window. By selecting the rightmost, the next window starts at pos+1, which ensures that no window is missed.

Thus, the selected positions form a valid covering set.

Thus, the code should work.

Testing sample 2:

s=abcab, m=2.

Precompute last_occurrence for each character:

For 'a':

i=0: a → last_occurrence[0] =0.

i=1: no → 0.

i=2: no →0.

i=3: a →3.

i=4: no →3.

For 'b':

i=0: no →-1.

i=1: b →1.

i=2: no →1.

i=3: no →1.

i=4: b →4.

For 'c':

i=2: c →2.

...

Now, for each window:

window 0:

i=0, r=1.

Check 'a' → last_pos =0 >=0 → yes. rightmost_min[0]=0.

window1:

i=1, r=2.

Check 'a' → last_occurrence[1] =0 <1 → no.

Check 'b' → last_occurrence[1] =1 >=1 → yes. rightmost_min[1] =1.

window2:

i=2, r=3.

Check 'a' → last_occurrence[3] =3 >=2 → yes. rightmost_min[2]=3.

window3:

i=3, r=4.

Check 'a' → last_occurrence[4]=3 >=3 → yes. rightmost_min[3]=3.

Thus, rightmost_min = [0,1,3,3].

But len(s)-m =5-2=3. So the windows are 0,1,2,3.

The algorithm:

earliest=0 → select 0 → earliest=1.

earliest=1 → select1 → earliest=2.

earliest=2 → select3 → earliest=4.

Now, earliest=4 > len(s)-m=3 → loop ends.

Selected positions are0,1,3. characters a, b, a → sorted aab.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the algorithm works.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows.
