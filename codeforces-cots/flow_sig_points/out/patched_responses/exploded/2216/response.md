<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of distinct substrings in a given string t that start with sbegin and end with send. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's understand the problem. The substrings must start exactly with sbegin and end exactly with send. And the substring must be continuous. Also, the substrings are considered different if their content is different, regardless of their positions. So, even if two occurrences have the same substring, they count as one if they are the same.

The main challenge is to efficiently find all such substrings and count the distinct ones, especially considering the input size constraints. The maximum length of t is 2000, which suggests that an O(n^2) solution might be feasible, but we need to be careful with the approach to avoid timeouts.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Find all the starting indices in t where sbegin occurs.
2. Find all the ending indices in t where send occurs.
3. For each possible pair of a start index and end index (such that the start is before the end plus the length of send), check if the substring from start to end (plus send's length) is valid. But this might be too slow if done naively, especially if there are many start and end positions.

Wait, but how do we generate all possible substrings that start with sbegin and end with send? For a substring to satisfy the conditions, it must start with sbegin exactly (so the substring starts at some index i and the next len(sbegin) characters are sbegin). Similarly, it must end with send, so the substring ends at some index j where the substring from j - len(send) + 1 to j is send.

So the approach could be:

- Collect all the starting positions of sbegin in t. Let's call this list starts. Each element is the index where sbegin starts.
- Collect all the ending positions of send in t. Let's call this list ends. Each element is the index where send ends (so the substring is from (index - len(send) + 1) to index inclusive).

Then, for each possible start in starts and end in ends, we need to check if the start is <= (end - len(send) + 1), because the start's sbegin starts at i, and the end's send starts at (j - len(send) + 1). So the substring from i to j must be such that the sbegin is at the beginning and send is at the end, with possible overlap. So the start position i must be <= (j - len(send) +1), and the substring from i to j (inclusive) must include both sbegin and send.

Wait, the substring must start with sbegin and end with send. So the entire sbegin is the prefix of the substring, and the entire send is the suffix. So for a substring starting at i and ending at j (inclusive), the length must be at least len(sbegin) + len(send) -1 (if they overlap completely) or longer.

Wait, no. Let's think: the substring starts with sbegin. So the first len(sbegin) characters of the substring are sbegin. Then, the substring must end with send, so the last len(send) characters are send. The substring can be of any length that allows both, which could be as short as len(sbegin) + len(send) -1 (if the send starts right after sbegin starts, but overlaps). For example, if sbegin is "ab", send is "ba", then the substring "aba" would start with "ab" (positions 0-1) and end with "ba" (positions 1-2). So the substring is from 0 to 2, which is 3 characters long (len(sbegin) is 2, len(send) is 2: 2+2-1=3).

So the conditions are:

The substring starts at position i, and the substring from i to i + len(sbegin) -1 is sbegin.

The substring ends at position j (the end of the substring), and the substring from j - len(send) +1 to j is send.

Moreover, the substring's end must be >= start + len(sbegin) -1 (since the substring must start with sbegin) and the send must start at some position after or overlapping with the sbegin.

So for a valid substring, the start index i (where sbegin starts) and the end index j (where send ends) must satisfy:

i <= j - len(send) +1 + len(send) -1 ?

Wait, no. Let me rephrase: the substring starts at i and ends at some position k. The substring's first len(sbegin) characters are sbegin, so k >= i + len(sbegin) -1 (since the substring has to be at least len(sbegin) characters long). The substring's last len(send) characters are send, so k - len(send) +1 must be >= i (since send starts at k - len(send) +1 and ends at k). So the send's starting position is s = k - len(send) +1. The substring starts at i, and the send starts at s. So s must be >= i. Also, the send's start s must be such that s + len(send) -1 = k. So the entire substring is from i to k.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the possible substrings as follows:

Each valid substring must start with sbegin (so starts at some i, and the next len(sbegin) characters are sbegin). Then, the substring can have any length as long as the ending part (the last len(send) characters) is equal to send. So the substring's end must be such that the last len(send) characters are send.

So, for a substring starting at i (with sbegin) and ending at k (inclusive), the substring must be of length L >= len(sbegin) and L >= len(send), but the send must be the last part. So the substring's length must be >= max(len(sbegin), len(send)). Wait, but maybe the send is shorter than sbegin, but in that case, the substring must still end with send. For example, sbegin is 'abc', send is 'd', then the substring could be 'abcd' (starts with 'abc', ends with 'd').

So the correct approach is:

For each occurrence of sbegin in the string (i.e., each start i where t[i:i+len_sbegin] == sbegin), and for each occurrence of send (each end j where t[j - len_send + 1 : j+1] == send), if j >= i + len_sbegin -1 (because the substring must start at i, include the sbegin (length len_sbegin), then the send must end at j. The send starts at j - len_send +1. For the substring to include both, the send's start must be >= i, and the send's end is j. So the substring is from i to j.

But wait, the substring starts at i, includes the sbegin, and ends at j (inclusive), and the send must be the end of the substring. So the substring's length is j - i + 1. The send is of length len_send, so the last len_send characters of the substring must be send. So the substring is t[i ... j], and t[j - len_send + 1 ... j] must equal send.

But j - len_send + 1 must be >= i, because otherwise the substring starting at i and ending at j is shorter than the required len_send for the send.

So for a pair (i, j) where i is a start of sbegin and j is the end of send (i.e., j is the end of an occurrence of send), and j >= i + len_sbegin - 1, then the substring from i to j is a candidate if the send part is at the end. Wait, but the send part could be overlapping with the sbegin part.

But how to model this?

Alternative approach: For each occurrence i of sbegin, collect all possible substrings that start at i and have at least len(sbegin) characters, and end with send. The substring must be from i to j (inclusive), where j is the end of an occurrence of send, and j >= i + len(sbegin) -1 (since the start part is sbegin). Additionally, the substring must end with send, which is t[j - len_send + 1 ... j] == send.

But how to efficiently find all possible j's for each i, such that j is the end of an occurrence of send and j >= i + len_sbegin -1, and then check if the substring i..j ends with send.

Wait, but j is already part of the send's end. So the send's occurrence ends at j, meaning that t[j - len_send + 1 ... j] == send. So the substring from i to j will have the send as its end.

But what if the substring i to j includes the send occurrence, but the send is not at the end? For example, if the send occurs earlier in the substring. But according to our selection of j as the end of send occurrence, the send is at the end.

So, for a given i (start of sbegin) and j (end of send), the substring from i to j will have sbegin at the start and send at the end. Because the start is sbegin, and the end is send. So all such substrings are valid.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute all the start positions of sbegin in t. Let's call this list starts. For each start in starts, i is the index where sbegin starts.

2. Precompute all end positions of send in t. For each occurrence, j is the index where send ends (so send starts at j - len_send + 1 and ends at j).

3. For each start i in starts, and for each end j in ends, check if j >= i (since the substring must start at i and end at j, and the sbegin is i..i+len_sbegin-1, which is part of the substring. So j must be >= i + len_sbegin -1. Because the sbegin takes up len_sbegin characters starting at i, so the substring must be at least len_sbegin long. But the send's end is j, which must be >= i + len_sbegin -1. So j >= i + len_sbegin -1?

Wait, the sbegin starts at i and is len_sbegin long. So the sbegin ends at i + len_sbegin -1. The send starts at j - len_send +1 and ends at j. So for the substring to include both, the send's start must be >= i (so that the send is within the substring i..j). Also, the send's end must be j. So j >= i + len_sbegin -1 is not necessarily required. For example, if sbegin is "ab" (len 2), and send is "ba" (len 2). If i is 0 and j is 1. Then the substring is 0-1, which is "ab", but the send is "ba" which is not in this substring. Wait, no. j is 1, which is the end of send. So send is j - len_send +1 to j: 0 to 1. So in this case, i=0 (sbegin starts at 0), j=1 (send ends at 1). The substring is 0-1 (length 2), which is "ab". The send part is 0-1, which is "ab", but the send is supposed to be "ba". So this example would not be valid. So j must be such that the send occurrence is valid. So perhaps the steps are:

For each i in starts:

   For each j in ends where j >= i (since the substring starts at i and ends at j. The send's end is j, which must be >= i to have a non-negative length substring. But the substring could be just sbegin followed by send, but overlapping. For example, sbegin is "ab", send is "ba", and the substring is "aba" (i=0, j=2: the send ends at 2. Then the send starts at 1, which is within the substring 0-2. So the substring is "aba", starts with "ab", ends with "ba".

So the condition is that the send's start (j - len_send +1) must be >= i (since the send is part of the substring starting at i). Because the send starts at s_start = j - len_send +1. For s_start to be >= i, since the substring starts at i, the send can't start before i.

So the condition for a pair (i, j) to be valid is:

s_start = j - len_send +1 >= i 

and 

i + len_sbegin -1 <= j 

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: The sbegin starts at i and ends at i + len_sbegin -1. The send starts at s_start and ends at j. The substring is from i to j. So the send must be entirely within the substring, so s_start >= i, and j >= i.

But also, the send can start anywhere in the substring. But for the substring to start with sbegin, the sbegin must be the prefix of the substring. So the first len_sbegin characters (from i to i+len_sbegin-1) must be sbegin. The send is at the end of the substring, so the last len_send characters (from j - len_send +1 to j) must be send. So regardless of how the rest of the substring is structured, as long as these two conditions are met, the substring is valid.

Therefore, the substring is valid if:

1. The substring starts with sbegin (i is in starts).

2. The substring ends with send (j is in ends).

3. The send starts at s_start = j - len_send +1, which must be >= i (so that the send is part of the substring).

So the valid (i, j) pairs are those where i is a start of sbegin, j is an end of send, and s_start >= i.

So for each i in starts and j in ends, check if (j - len_send +1) >= i. If yes, then the substring from i to j is valid.

But how do we collect all such substrings and count the distinct ones?

The problem requires counting the distinct substrings. So even if two different (i,j) pairs generate the same substring, they count as one.

So the challenge is to collect all the substrings t[i..j] (inclusive) for all valid (i,j) pairs, then count the unique ones.

But for t of length 2000, starts could be up to O(n) (n=2000) entries (if sbegin is a single character and all characters are the same). Similarly, ends could be O(n) entries. So the total possible pairs are O(n^2), which is 2000*2000=4,000,000. For each pair, we extract the substring and store it in a set. But for n=2000, a substring of length up to 2000 could take O(n) time to generate, and storing 4 million such substrings in a set would take O(n^3) time and O(n^3) space. Which is way too much for the constraints (2 seconds and 256MB).

So the naive approach is not feasible. We need a more efficient way to compute the number of distinct substrings that meet the criteria.

Alternative approach: Using a suffix automaton or a trie to represent all possible valid substrings and count the unique ones. However, building a suffix automaton for all possible valid substrings might be manageable, but how?

Another idea: For each valid (i,j) pair, the substring is t[i..j]. We need to collect all such substrings and find their count. To optimize, perhaps we can find all possible i and j pairs efficiently and then use hashing (like a set of tuples (i,j)), but even that would take O(k) space where k is the number of valid pairs. But for k up to 4 million, that's manageable in Python's memory? Maybe not. But in Python, each tuple is about 40 bytes. 4 million tuples would be 160MB, which is manageable.

But storing all the substrings in a set would require O(k * average substring length) space. For average length 1000, 4 million entries would take 4 million * 1000 = 4e9 bytes, which is 4GB. That's way over the memory limit.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Find all possible valid substrings and compute their hash (like a rolling hash) to store in a set. This way, the storage is O(k) in terms of the number of hashes. But even this, for 4 million entries, each hash being a 64-bit integer (8 bytes) would take 32MB, which is manageable.

But how to compute the hash of t[i..j] quickly for all possible i and j pairs?

We can precompute the prefix hashes using a rolling hash (like Rabin-Karp) with a base and mod. Then, the hash of substring t[i..j] can be computed in O(1) time using the prefix hashes.

Yes. So precompute the prefix hashes and then for each (i,j) pair, compute the hash quickly and store it in a set.

This would reduce the time and space needed.

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute all starts (i) where sbegin occurs (t[i:i+len_sbegin] == sbegin).

2. Precompute all ends (j) where send occurs (t[j - len_send + 1 ... j] == send).

3. Precompute a rolling hash for the entire string t. For example, using a base of 911 and mod of 1e18 + 3 (a large prime). The prefix hash array and the power array.

4. For each i in starts and j in ends, check if (j - len_send +1) >= i. If yes, compute the hash of t[i..j] using the precomputed hash arrays and add to a set.

5. The size of the set is the answer.

But even with this, the time may be O(k), which for k=4 million is acceptable. However, in Python, 4 million iterations are manageable, but need to be optimized.

But there's another problem: the starts and ends could be overlapping. For example, if sbegin is 'a' and send is 'a', then the starts are all positions and ends are all positions. Then, the number of pairs could be O(n^2), which is 2000^2 = 4 million. So for each of these 4 million pairs, check if j - len_send +1 >= i (len_send is 1, so j >= i). So for len_send=1, j >= i. So for each i, j must be >= i. For a string of length 2000, starts and ends each have 2000 entries. The number of valid pairs is (2000 * 2001)/2 = 2,001,000 pairs. For each, compute the hash and add to a set.

But with the precomputed rolling hash, each hash computation is O(1). So for 2 million iterations, this is manageable.

So this approach would work.

Now, the next steps are:

Implement the code to precompute starts and ends.

Then precompute the rolling hash.

Then iterate through all possible (i,j) pairs that are valid, compute their hash, add to a set, and finally output the size of the set.

But how to compute starts and ends?

For starts: we need to find all i such that the substring t[i:i + len_sbegin] == sbegin.

Similarly for ends: all j such that t[j - len_send + 1 : j+1] == send.

To compute starts:

len_sbegin = len(sbegin). So iterate i from 0 to len(t) - len_sbegin. For each i, check if t starts with sbegin at i.

Similarly for ends: j must be >= len_send -1 (since the substring is j - len_send +1 to j, which needs to be within the string). So j ranges from len_send-1 to len(t)-1.

Check if the substring t[j - len_send +1 : j+1] equals send.

So in Python, for starts:

starts = []
len_sbegin = len(sbegin)
for i in range(len(t) - len_sbegin +1):
    if t[i:i+len_sbegin] == sbegin:
        starts.append(i)

Similarly for ends:

ends = []
len_send = len(send)
for j in range(len_send -1, len(t)):
    start = j - len_send +1
    if t[start:j+1] == send:
        ends.append(j)

Once we have starts and ends, we need to process all pairs (i,j) where j >= (i + len_sbegin -1) ?

No, the earlier condition is that the send starts at j - len_send +1 >= i.

Wait, for the substring i..j to start with sbegin and end with send, the sbegin is the first part (i to i+len_sbegin-1) and the send is the last part (j - len_send +1 to j). So the entire substring is i..j. For the send to be part of the substring, the send's start (s_start = j - len_send +1) must be >= i, so that the send is entirely within the substring.

But the sbegin is of length len_sbegin, so the substring must have at least len_sbegin characters. But if the send's len is longer than the substring's length, then it's impossible. However, since j >= s_start >= i, the substring's length is j - i +1. The send's length is len_send. So j - i +1 >= len_send. So the substring's length is at least len_send.

But perhaps the sbegin and send can be of any lengths. So for a valid (i,j) pair, the send's start (s_start) must be >= i and the send's end is j. The sbegin's start is i, and its end is i + len_sbegin -1. The send can start anywhere after or equal to i. So the send's start can be >= i, and j >= s_start.

So the condition is j - len_send +1 >= i.

So, for each i in starts and j in ends:

if (j - len_send +1) >= i:

then the substring i..j is a candidate.

So, in code:

valid_pairs = set()

len_sbegin = len(sbegin)
len_send = len(send)

for i in starts:
    for j in ends:
        s_start = j - len_send +1
        if s_start >= i:
            # substring is t[i..j]
            # compute its hash and add to the set
            hash_val = get_hash(i, j)
            valid_pairs.add(hash_val)

So the key is to compute the hash of t[i..j] efficiently.

Implementing the rolling hash.

Let's choose two different bases and mod values to minimize collision probability, but for the problem constraints, perhaps a single hash is sufficient. But since the problem counts distinct substrings, any collision would lead to incorrect counts, so we need to use a double hash (store pairs of hash values) to reduce the collision probability. However, for the sake of time and code length, perhaps a single large mod is sufficient. Alternatively, in Python, we can use a tuple of (prefix_hash, i, j) as the key, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, just use the start and end indices and the substring's hash.

But even with the rolling hash, for each (i,j) pair, the hash can be computed as (prefix_hash[j+1] - prefix_hash[i] * power[j - i +1]) % mod.

So, to compute this, we need to precompute the prefix hashes and the power array.

Let's proceed with a base of 911382629 (a prime), mod of 10^18 + 3 (another large prime).

So first, precompute the prefix hash array and the power array.

But according to the code, for each (i,j) pair, the code computes the hash of the substring t[i..j]. For example, when i=0 and j=1: t[0:1+1] → 'ab' → hash is stored. Then, when i=2 and j=3: t[2:4] → 'ab' → same hash. So in the set, 'ab' is added once. But according to the problem statement, the distinct substrings are considered, so the code's approach counts this as one. But in the third example, the answer is 4. Wait, but according to the example note, the answer is four: 'ab', 'abab', 'ababab', 'abababab'.

Wait, but according to the code, the pairs (i,j) would be:

For i=0:

j can be 1,3,5,7. The substrings are:

0-1: ab (len 2)

0-3: abab (len4)

0-5: ababab (len6)

0-7: abababab (len8)

For i=2:

j can be 3,5,7. The substrings are 2-3 (ab, len2), 2-5 (abab, len4), 2-7 (ababab, len6).

For i=4:

j can be 5,7. Substrings 4-5 (ab, len2), 4-7 (abab, len4).

For i=6:

j=7: ab (len2).

So the code's code would collect all these substrings. But the code uses a hash to store each unique substring. So in the code's code, the substrings 'ab' (appearing in (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7)) would have the same hash. Similarly, 'abab' would be generated by (0,3), (2,5), (4,7). 'ababab' by (0,5), (2,7). 'abababab' by (0,7). So in the set, these four unique substrings are added, giving a count of 4. So the code's code would output 4, which is correct.

But according to the code, the code's set would have four elements. So the code works.

Fourth example:

aba
ab
ba

t = 'aba', len 3.

sbegin is 'ab' (len 2). So starts are positions where t[i:i+2] == 'ab'. Check i=0: 'ab' (yes). i=1: 'ba' (no). So starts = [0].

send is 'ba' (len 2). ends are j >=1 (since len_send-1 =1). For j=1: start 0-1 (t[0:2] = 'ab' → no. j=2: start 1-2 (t[1:3] = 'ba' → yes. So ends = [2].

So for i=0, j=2. Check s_start = 2-2+1=1. s_start=1 >=0 → valid. The substring is 0-2 → 'aba'. It starts with 'ab' (0-1) and ends with 'ba' (1-2). So the substring is 'aba', which is valid. So the code's set will have this substring's hash. So the answer is 1, which matches the example.

So the code works.

Now, let's think about the code's time and space.

For the code:

- Precomputing starts and ends is O(n * len_sbegin) and O(n * len_send), which for n=2000 is acceptable.

- Precomputing the prefix_hash and power is O(n).

- The main loop is O(k), where k is the number of valid (i,j) pairs. For worst case, if starts and ends are O(n) each, and for each i, all j's are valid, then k is O(n^2) which is 4e6. But in Python, 4e6 iterations are manageable.

Each iteration involves a check and a hash computation. The hash computation is O(1) with precomputed arrays.

The set storage is O(k) entries. For k=4e6, each entry is a 64-bit integer. So 4e6 * 8 bytes = 32MB, which is acceptable.

So the code should pass the constraints.

Potential optimizations:

- Precompute len_send and len_sbegin once.

- Precompute ends and starts first, then process.

Other optimizations may not be needed.

Now, code:

But in Python, the code must read three lines, compute the answer, and print it.

So the code is as follows:
</think>

```python
mod = 10**18 + 3
base = 911382629

t = input().strip()
sbegin = input().strip()
send = input().strip()

len_t = len(t)
len_sbegin = len(sbegin)
len_send = len(send)

starts = []
for i in range(len_t - len_sbegin + 1):
    if t[i:i+len_sbegin] == sbegin:
        starts.append(i)

ends = []
if len_send > 0:
    for j in range(len_send - 1, len_t):
        start = j - len_send + 1
        if t[start:j+1] == send:
            ends.append(j)

prefix_hash = [0] * (len_t + 1)
power = [1] * (len_t + 1)
for i in range(len_t):
    prefix_hash[i+1] = (prefix_hash[i] * base + ord(t[i])) % mod
    power[i+1] = (power[i] * base) % mod

def get_hash(l, r):
    length = r - l + 1
    return (prefix_hash[r+1] - prefix_hash[l] * power[length]) % mod

unique = set()

for i in starts:
    len_i = len_send
    for j in ends:
        s_start = j - len_send + 1
        if s_start >= i:
            current_hash = get_hash(i, j)
            unique.add(current_hash)

print(len(unique))
```
