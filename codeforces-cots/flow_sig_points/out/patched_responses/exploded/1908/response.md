Okay, let's see. The problem is about three people on a rope, and we need to find the minimum time (in seconds) such that after moving, each pair of them is at least distance d apart. Each second, only one person can move one unit. So, each second contributes exactly one movement. So the total time is the sum of all the moves required.

Hmm. The key is to figure out how to arrange the three people such that the pairwise distances are at least d, and then compute how many steps are needed to reach that arrangement from the initial positions.

First, the initial positions are a, b, c. But since the order might not be sorted, maybe we should sort them. Because the optimal arrangement would probably have them in a line with certain spacing. Let's think about the optimal positions.

Let me think: after moving, the three people need to be in positions x, y, z (sorted) such that y - x >=d and z - y >=d. Then the pairwise distances would be at least d. Because x <= y <= z, the distances between x and y is >=d, y and z is >=d. So the other pairs (x and z) would have distance at least 2d, which is >=d. So the minimal required arrangement is when they are spaced exactly d apart. Like x, x +d, x + 2d. Or maybe the initial positions are such that they can be adjusted with minimal movement.

Wait, maybe the optimal way is to arrange them as a sorted triplet where the two gaps between consecutive elements are exactly d. Because that's the minimal possible required to meet the pairwise distance constraints. Because if you have any larger gaps, that might require more total movement. So, for example, if the sorted initial positions are a, b, c (sorted), then we can arrange them into a new sorted triplet where the leftmost is as far right as possible, and the middle is leftmost +d, and the right is middle +d. Alternatively, maybe adjust the middle positions to minimize the total movement.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal positions are the minimal possible adjustments from the original sorted positions, ensuring that the gaps between the first and second, and second and third are at least d.

Wait, let's sort the initial positions. Let's say after sorting, we have x, y, z. So x <= y <= z. Then, the required is that y must be at least x +d, and z must be at least y +d. So the minimal possible positions after movement would be x_new, y_new, z_new where:

y_new >= x_new +d

z_new >= y_new +d

The problem is to find x_new, y_new, z_new such that these inequalities hold, and the sum of |x_new - x| + |y_new - y| + |z_new - z| is minimized. Because each step is moving one person by one unit, the total steps are the sum of the absolute differences between initial and final positions.

So the problem reduces to arranging the three sorted positions into a new triplet that satisfies the spacing constraints, with minimal total movement.

So the first step is to sort the initial positions. Let's sort them into x, y, z. Then, we need to compute the minimal moves required to adjust x, y, z into a new triplet (a, b, c) where a <= b <= c, and b >= a +d, c >= b +d.

Wait, but in this case, a, b, c would be the new positions. So the constraints are:

b >= a + d

c >= b +d

So the minimal arrangement would be when a is as high as possible (so that the initial x is as close as possible to a), and similarly for the others.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal a, b, c is such that:

a = x + delta1 (but delta1 could be positive or negative, depending on what's needed to meet the spacing)

But perhaps the best way is to fix a and c such that between a and c, there's exactly 2d space. Then, the middle position is a +d. Then, how does this compare to other possibilities?

Alternatively, let's imagine that after adjusting, the new positions are x', y', z', sorted, such that x' is as close as possible to the original x, y to the original y, z to original z, but ensuring that y' -x' >=d and z' - y' >=d.

So how to model this? Let's think about the sorted initial positions x, y, z.

The required is that after movement, the new positions (sorted) are x', y', z' where:

y' >= x' +d

z' >= y' +d

We need to minimize the total movement: (x' - x) if x' >=x, else (x -x') ... same for others.

Wait, but movement can be in any direction. So the sum is |x' -x| + |y' - y| + |z' - z|. But since the new positions are sorted, x' <= y' <= z', but the original positions are already sorted. However, after movement, x' can be adjusted to be lower or higher than x, as long as the constraints are met.

But perhaps the optimal positions are to adjust the middle and right positions as little as possible, given the left position. Or perhaps the left position is adjusted to the maximum possible, given the constraints.

Let's think of the minimal movement required. For example, the initial x, y, z.

To satisfy y' >= x' +d, and z' >= y' +d. So the minimal possible arrangement is x' = x, y' = max(y, x +d), z' = max(z, y' +d). But that's not necessarily correct because maybe moving x' to the right would allow y' and z' to be adjusted with less movement.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal positions are x', x' +d, x' + 2d. But where x' is chosen to minimize the sum of the distances from x, y, z to these points.

Wait, for example, if the original sorted positions are 2, 3, 10, and d=4. Then the required is that the new positions are spaced with gaps >=4. So, 2, 6, 10 would give gaps 4 and 4. Then the movement is (3 to 6 is +3, so sum is 0 +3 +0 =3. Which matches the fourth test case's output.

Wait, the fourth test case input is 2 3 10 4. Output 3. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal positions are x', x' +d, x' +d +d. So x' can be chosen as the maximum between x, (y -d), (z - 2d). Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Let's suppose the new positions are x', x' +d, x' +2d. Then, the new positions must be such that:

x' +d >= x' (obviously)

x' +2d >= x' +d +d → yes.

But also, the new positions must be >= the original positions' movement to minimize the sum.

Wait, but that's just one possible arrangement. The minimal sum could come from another arrangement where the middle position is higher than x' +d but lower than the required. For example, if the original positions are 5,2,6 (sorted as 2,5,6). d=3. The required positions are 2, 5, 8. The sum is 0 (for 2) +0 (for 5) +2 (for 6 to 8) → sum 2. Which matches the first example.

So in that case, the new positions are x' =2, y' =5 (since 2+3=5), z' =5+3=8. So x' is same as original, y' is same, z' is 8. So the sum is 0+0+2=2.

So in this case, the arrangement is x', x'+d, x' + 2d. So that's the minimal possible.

Another example: input 3,1,5,6. So sorted as 1,3,5. The required is that each pair is at least 6. So the minimal possible positions would be such that the first and second are 6 apart, and second and third are 6 apart. So for example, 1, 7, 13. The sum would be (3-7 is 4 moves, 5-13 is 8 moves. Total 4+8=12. But the example's output is 8. Oh, wait that's not matching.

Wait the second example's input is 3 1 5 6. Output is 8. Let's see. The sorted positions are 1,3,5. The required distances are >=6 between all pairs. How to arrange that?

The minimal positions would have to be such that the first is at x', second at x' +6, third at x' +12. But that's a big stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the new positions can be arranged with the middle as x' +6, and the third as x' +6 +6. Then, the sum would be |x' -1| + |x' +6 -3| + |x' +12 -5|. To find x' that minimizes this sum.

Alternatively, maybe arrange the three as a, a+6, a+12. Let's find the a that minimizes the sum of |a-1| + |a+6 -3| + |a+12 -5|.

Simplify:

sum = |a-1| + |a+3| + |a+7|.

We need to find a that minimizes this. The optimal a is likely around the median of the points 1, -3, -7. Wait, but that's for absolute values. Wait, the sum is |a-1| + |a - (-3)| + |a - (-7)|. The median of 1, -3, -7 is -3. Let's check a=-3:

sum is 4 +0 +4 =8. Which matches the example's output. So the new positions are a=-3, a+6=3, a+12=9. So the sum of movement is:

-3 (from 1 → -3: movement is 4 steps)

3 (from 3 →3: 0 steps)

9 (from 5 →9:4 steps). Sum 4+0+4=8.

Yes, that's correct.

So in this case, the optimal arrangement is x' = -3, y' =3, z' =9. Which gives the required spacing. The sum is 8.

So the approach here is to arrange the three positions as a, a+d, a+2d, and find a such that the sum of the distances from the original points (sorted) to these new positions is minimized. Then, the minimal sum for this arrangement is the answer.

But why is that the case? Because in this arrangement, the three points are spaced exactly d apart, which is the minimal required. Any other arrangement that satisfies the constraints would require that the total sum is not smaller. Because if the new positions are a, b, c, sorted, then to meet the constraints, b must be at least a +d and c must be at least b +d. So the minimal total sum would be achieved when each is exactly d apart. Otherwise, if you have more spacing, you'd have to move more.

Wait, but suppose the original positions are such that when you arrange them as a, a+d, a+2d, you have to move a lot. Maybe there's a better arrangement where the three are spaced more than d, but the total movement is less.

Wait, for example: original positions are 0, 0, 0. d=1. Then the minimal arrangement would be 0,1,2. Total movement is 0+1+2=3. Alternatively, if you arrange them as 0,1,3: then movement is 0+1+3=4. Which is worse. So the minimal is when arranged as exactly spaced by d. So that seems to hold.

Another example: original positions are 1, 2, 100. d=3. If arranged as a, a+3, a+6. To minimize sum |a-1| + |a+3-2| + |a+6-100|. Let's see. Let's find a that minimizes this sum.

sum = |a-1| + |a+1| + |a -94|.

The median of 1, -1, 94 is 1. So a=1. Then sum is 0 +2 +93=95. Alternatively, a= -1: sum is 2 +0 +95=97. So the best is a=1, sum 95. The positions are 1,4,7. But then 7 is way less than 100, so movement for that is 93. But maybe another arrangement where the third position is at 100. Let's see. For example, a=1, a+3=4, a+6=7. So that's sum 95. Alternatively, arrange as 1,4,100. Then the sum is 0 (for 1) +2 (from 2 to4) +0 (100 to100) → sum 2. Which is better, but this arrangement has 4-1=3 >=d=3, 100-4=96 >=3. So that's valid. So the sum is 2 steps. Which is way better. So the initial approach of arranging as a, a+d, a+2d is not optimal in this case.

Oh! So that suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. So there's a flaw in the reasoning.

So why is that possible? Because in this example, moving the third person from 100 to 100 (so no movement) is better than moving them to a+6. So in this case, the optimal arrangement is not to arrange the three in a, a+d, a+2d, but to adjust the first two to be spaced exactly d, and leave the third as it is (if possible). So the minimal sum here is 2 steps (moving the second from 2 to4).

So the initial approach of assuming that the three must be in a, a+d, a+2d is incorrect. Therefore, the problem requires a different approach.

So, the problem is to arrange the three sorted positions x <= y <= z into new positions x' <= y' <= z', such that y' >= x' +d and z' >= y' +d, and the sum |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z| is minimized.

So how to model this?

Let's think of the constraints again. The new positions must satisfy:

y' >= x' +d --> (1)

z' >= y' +d --> (2)

We can model this as x' can be as small as possible, but y' is at least x' +d. Then, z' is at least y' +d. But how to find x', y', z' that meet these constraints and minimize the sum of movements.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as three variables x' <= y' <= z' such that:

y' >= x' +d

z' >= y' +d

The sum of |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z| must be minimal.

But how do we find such x', y', z'?

An alternative approach is to model this as:

After sorting the initial positions as x, y, z, the new positions x', y', z' must satisfy:

x' <= y' -d

y' <= z' -d

But also, x' <= y' <= z'.

So combining these, the constraints are:

y' >= x' +d

z' >= y' +d

So x' can be as small as possible, but subject to these constraints. However, we need to minimize the sum of movements.

But perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when the new positions are as close as possible to the original ones, but satisfying the constraints.

Let's model this step by step.

After sorting, the original positions are x <= y <= z.

We need to find new positions x', y', z' (sorted) such that:

y' >= x' +d --> (1)

z' >= y' +d --> (2)

The minimal sum of |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z|.

Let's consider that to minimize the sum, x' should be as close as possible to x, y' as close as possible to y, and z' as close as possible to z. But the constraints must be met.

So let's first compute the minimal possible x' and z' given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps the optimal positions are such that:

x' is as large as possible (to minimize movement from x) but not so large that it forces y' and z' to move more.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the constraints as:

The minimal possible y' is max(y, x' +d)

But then, once y' is determined, the minimal possible z' is max(z, y' +d).

But x' can be adjusted to minimize the sum.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

We need to choose x' and z' such that:

x' <= y' -d

y' <= z' -d

But also, y' is between x' and z'.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the constraints can be rewritten as:

x' can be any value <= (y' -d)

y' can be any value between x' +d and z' -d.

z' >= y' +d.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by adjusting the leftmost and rightmost positions first, then the middle.

Wait, maybe the middle position (y') is forced to be at least x' +d, and z' is forced to be at least y' +d. But perhaps x' can be increased from x to a certain value, which reduces the required movement for y' and z'.

Alternatively, let's think of the minimal required positions as follows:

The middle position (y') must be >= x' +d. So the minimal x' that allows y' to be as small as possible is x' = y' -d. But since y' can be as small as possible to be as close to the original y, perhaps the optimal x' is such that x' +d <= y. So that y' can be at most y. But this might not be possible if x +d is already larger than y.

Wait, perhaps the optimal positions are:

x' = x (original left)

y' = max(y, x +d)

z' = max(z, y' +d)

But this might not account for cases where moving x' to the right reduces the required movement for y' and z'.

Alternatively, another approach: the required is that y' >= x' +d and z' >= y' +d.

These can be combined as z' >= x' + 2d.

So the minimal possible x' and z' must satisfy x' <= z' - 2d.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by moving x as little as possible and z as little as possible, but ensuring that z' - x' >= 2d. Then, the middle position y' can be adjusted between x' and z' as much as needed.

But wait, in that case, the middle position y' can be any value between x' and z', but it must be at least x' +d, and z' must be at least y' +d. But if z' >= x' + 2d, then setting y' = x' +d and z' = x' + 2d would satisfy all constraints.

But in that case, the sum would be |x' -x| + |x' +d -y| + |x' +2d - z|.

But perhaps this is the same as the earlier approach of setting x', x'+d, x'+2d, and finding the x' that minimizes the sum.

But the previous example shows that this is not always optimal. For example, when x=1, y=3, z=5, and d=6, the optimal arrangement is x'=-3, y'=3, z'=9. Sum is 4+0+4=8. But if we arrange as x', x'+6, x'+12, then x' must be such that x' +12 >=5. So x' can be at least -7 (since x' +12 >=5 → x' >=-7). Then, the sum for x'=-3 is 4+0+4=8. For x'=-7, sum is |1 - (-7)| →8 + |3 - (-7+6)=3-(-1)=4 steps? Wait x' is -7. x' +6 = -1. x' +12=5. So sum is |1 - (-7)|=8, |3 - (-1)|=4, |5-5|=0. Sum 12. Which is worse than 8.

So the minimal sum in that example comes from choosing x'=-3, which gives the sum 8. But according to the earlier approach of finding the x' that minimizes |x' -x| + |x'+d -y| + |x' +2d -z|, the optimal x' is the median of x, y -d, z - 2d. Let's see:

In the example where x=1, y=3, z=5, d=6.

The terms are x' -1, x' +6 -3, x' +12 -5. So sum is |x' -1| + |x' +3| + |x' +7|.

The median of 1, -3, -7 is -3. So x'=-3 gives sum 4 +0 +4=8. Which is correct.

So perhaps the initial approach of finding x' as the median of x, y -d, z - 2d is correct. Then, the sum would be minimized.

But what about the previous example where x=1, y=2, z=100, d=3. Let's see.

The terms are |x' -1| + |x' +3 -2| + |x' +6 -100|.

So sum is |x' -1| + |x' +1| + |x' -94|.

The median of 1, -1, 94 is 1. So x'=1.

Sum is 0 + 2 +93=95. But the optimal arrangement is to set x'=1, y'=4, z'=100, which gives sum 0+2+0=2.

So this approach gives a sum of 95, but the optimal sum is 2. So this indicates that the approach of arranging as x', x'+d, x'+2d is not correct.

So what's the problem here?

Ah, because in this example, the third position can be left as 100 (no movement) if the other two positions are adjusted to satisfy the constraints.

So in this case, the middle position y' must be >=x' +d. The third position z' must be >= y' +d. But the third position can be 100, which is larger than y' +d. So how?

In this example, the initial positions are x=1, y=2, z=100. d=3.

To meet the constraints:

y' >=x' +3.

z' >=y' +3.

But z' can be 100. So let's set x' to as large as possible, but such that y' can be as close to 2 as possible.

But how?

Let me think. Let's set x' to be the minimal possible so that y' can be 2. But x' must be <= y' -3 = 2-3 =-1. So x' can be any value <=-1. But then, z' must be >= 2+3=5. But 100 is >=5, so that's okay.

But the sum of movements is (x' -1) [if x' is >=1, but in this case x' <=-1] → the movement for x is |x' -1|. For y, movement is |2 -2|=0. For z, 0.

So to minimize |x' -1|, the best x' is as close to 1 as possible, but <=-1. The closest possible is x' =-1.

So sum is |-1 -1| =2 (for x), 0 (for y), 0 (for z). Total 2. Which is the optimal.

So in this case, the new positions are x'=-1, y'=2, z'=100. Then:

y' -x' =3 >=d=3.

z' -y' =98 >=3.

So all constraints are met. The sum is 2.

But according to the previous approach of arranging as x', x'+3, x'+6, the sum would be 95, but the optimal sum is 2. So the previous approach is not correct.

So the problem is that the new positions don't have to be spaced exactly d apart. They can have more than d, as long as the minimal sum is achieved.

So how to model the correct solution?

Alternative approach:

The new positions must satisfy:

y' >=x' +d

z' >=y' +d

But they can be arranged in any way that satisfies these two inequalities.

So, after sorting the initial positions as x, y, z, we need to find x', y', z' such that:

x' <= y' -d

y' <= z' -d

And x' <= y' <= z'

But how to find x', y', z' that minimizes the sum of |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z|.

We can model this as:

For the new positions, x' can be any value, but it must be at most y' -d.

Similarly, y' can be any value as long as it's at least x' +d and at most z' -d.

z' can be any value >= y' +d.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps there's a way to express x', y', z' in terms of two variables.

Alternatively, we can think of the constraints as:

x' <= y' -d

y' <= z' -d

Which can be combined into x' <= y' -d <= z' - 2d.

So, x' can be at most z' - 2d.

But perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when we set x' to be as large as possible (to minimize movement from x), and z' to be as small as possible (to minimize movement from z), given the constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to find for each possible arrangement:

Case 1: x' is fixed as x. Then, y' must be at least x +d, and z' must be at least y' +d. So y' can be max(y, x +d). Then z' can be max(z, y' +d). The sum is |x -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z|.

Case 2: z' is fixed as z. Then, y' must be at most z -d. x' must be at most y' -d. So y' can be min(y, z -d). x' can be min(x, y' -d). The sum is |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z -z|.

Case 3: x' and z' are adjusted to allow y' to remain as close as possible to y.

But how to model all possible cases.

Alternatively, let's consider all possible ways to arrange the new positions. The minimal sum will be the minimum between:

1. The sum when we arrange the three in a line spaced exactly d apart (previous approach).

2. The sum when we leave z as is and adjust x and y to satisfy the constraints.

3. The sum when we leave x as is and adjust y and z.

4. Other combinations where two of the positions are fixed and the third is adjusted.

But how many cases are there?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is the minimum of the following:

a) The sum when the three are arranged as x', x' +d, x' +2d (the previous approach).

b) The sum when we leave z as is, and adjust x and y to meet the constraints for the first two and then for the third.

For example, x' can be min(x, z - 2d), then y' is x' +d. z' is z. The sum is |x' -x| + |y' -y| + 0.

But this may not satisfy z' >= y' +d. Because if x' is z -2d, then y' = z -2d +d = z -d. Then z' is z, which is >= y' +d → z >= (z-d) +d → z >=z → yes. So in this case, this arrangement is valid.

So this is another possible arrangement.

Similarly, there's another arrangement where x' is fixed as x, y' is x +d, z' is max(z, y' +d).

So the sum for this case is 0 (x' =x) + |x +d - y| + |max(z, x +d +d) - z|.

So perhaps the minimal sum is the minimum between the sum from the a) approach and the sum from the b) approach, and other similar approaches.

So let's see:

The problem can have multiple possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints, and we need to find the one with minimal sum.

So, possible arrangements:

1. All three are adjusted to form a line with exactly d spacing between them (x', x' +d, x' +2d). The sum is calculated by finding x' that minimizes the sum of distances from x, y, z to x', x' +d, x' +2d.

2. Leave z as is, adjust x and y to form x' <= y' -d, and y' <= z -d. Then, x' can be as large as possible (<= y' -d), and y' can be as large as possible (<= z -d). So the maximum possible x' is (z -d) -d = z-2d. Then, y' = z -d. So x' must be <= z-2d, but can be as large as possible to minimize movement. So x' = min(x, z-2d). y' = z -d. So sum is |x' -x| + |(z-d) - y| + 0.

But wait, what if x' is larger than z-2d? Then, x' can't be larger than z-2d, so x' is set to z-2d. So x' is the minimum between x and z-2d. But if x is larger than z-2d, then x' is z-2d.

So the sum in this case is |min(x, z-2d) -x| + |(z-d - y)|.

But when x is less than or equal to z-2d, then x' is x. Then y' =x' +d. But if x' +d > z -d → x' > z -2d. So if x is <= z-2d, then x' +d = x +d. Then y' = x +d. Then z' must be at least y' +d = x +2d. But if z is already >= x+2d, then z' can be z. Otherwise, z' has to be x+2d.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: generate all possible candidate arrangements that could be optimal and compute their sums, then choose the minimal.

Let's think of possible candidates:

Candidate 1: arrange the three in a line spaced exactly d apart: x' = a, y' =a+d, z' =a+2d. Find a that minimizes the sum.

Candidate 2: fix x' =x. Then y' must be at least x +d, and z' must be at least y' +d. So y' = max(y, x +d). z' = max(z, y' +d). Sum is 0 + (y' -y) if y' >=y, else (y - y') → but since y' is max, sum is (y' -y) if y' >=y, else 0. Then z' is max(z, y' +d). So sum += (z' -z) if z' >=z else (z - z')?

No. The sum is |x' -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z|. Since x' =x, the first term is zero.

So sum is |max(y, x+d) -y| + |max(z, max(y, x+d) +d) -z|.

Which simplifies to (max(y, x+d) -y) if x +d > y, else 0, plus (max(z, (max(y, x+d)) +d) -z) if the max is larger than z, else 0.

Candidate 3: fix z' =z. Then y' must be <= z -d. x' must be <= y' -d. So y' is min(y, z -d). x' is min(x, y' -d). Sum is |x' -x| + |y' -y| +0.

Candidate 4: fix y' =y. Then x' <= y -d, z' >= y +d. So x' = min(x, y -d), z' = max(z, y +d). Sum is |x' -x| +0 + |z' -z|.

So these are four possible candidates. For each candidate, compute the sum and choose the minimal.

So the minimal sum would be the minimum of these four candidates.

Additionally, there might be other candidates, but these are the main ones.

So for example, in the previous example where x=1, y=2, z=100, d=3.

Candidate 1: a is the median of 1, (2-3)= -1, (100-6)=94. So a =-1. Sum is | -1 -1 | + | -1 +3 -2 | + | -1 +6 -100 | → 2 +0 + 95 =97. Which is higher than the optimal sum of 2.

Candidate 2: x'=1. y' = max(2, 1+3=4). So y'=4. z'= max(100,4+3=7). Sum is 0 + (4-2=2) +0 → sum 2. Which is the optimal.

Candidate 3: z'=100. y' = min(2, 100-3=97) → y'=2. x'= min(1, 2-3=-1) → x'=-1. Sum is |-1-1|=2 + |2-2|=0 +0 → sum 2. Which is also optimal.

Candidate4: y'=2. x'= min(1, 2-3=-1) →-1. z' =max(100, 2+3=5) →100. Sum is |-1-1|=2 +0 +0=2.

So in this case, candidates 2, 3,4 all give sum 2. So the minimal is 2.

So the approach would be to compute all possible candidates and take the minimal.

So the steps for solving the problem are:

1. Sort the initial positions a, b, c into x, y, z.

2. Compute the following candidate sums:

   a. The sum when the three are arranged as a line spaced exactly d apart (x' = a, y' =a+d, z'=a+2d). The optimal a is the median of x, y-d, z-2d.

   b. The sum when x is fixed (x'=x), y' is max(y, x+d), z' is max(z, y' +d).

   c. The sum when z is fixed (z'=z), y' is min(y, z-d), x' is min(x, y' -d).

   d. The sum when y is fixed (y'=y), x' is min(x, y-d), z' is max(z, y+d).

3. Additionally, compute other possible candidates like leaving x and z as is (if possible), but that's probably covered in the above candidates.

4. The minimal sum among all these candidates is the answer.

So, in code, after sorting the initial positions into x, y, z, compute all four candidate sums and take the minimal.

But how to compute each candidate.

For candidate 1: arranging as a line spaced d apart.

The sum is the sum of absolute differences between x and a, y and a +d, z and a+2d.

To find a that minimizes this sum.

The minimal sum for this case is achieved when a is the median of x, y-d, z-2d. Because the sum is |a -x| + |a +d -y| + |a +2d -z|. Let's set variables:

term1 = a -x → but absolute.

term2 = a +d -y → absolute.

term3 = a +2d -z → absolute.

The sum is the sum of these three absolute terms.

The minimal sum is achieved when a is the median of (x, y-d, z-2d). Because the sum of absolute differences is minimized at the median.

For example, in the case where x=1, y=2, z=5, d=3 (second example). The terms are x=1, y-d=2-3=-1, z-2d=5-6=-1. So the median of 1, -1, -1 is -1. So a=-1. Sum is | -1 -1 | + | -1 +3 -2 | + | -1 +6 -5 | →2 +0 +0=2.

Wait, but in that example, the sum for candidate 1 is 2. But the actual arrangement for the second example (input 3 1 5 6) is a=-3. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up examples.

Wait, the second example's input is 3 1 5 6. The sorted x, y, z are 1,3,5. d=6.

So for candidate1:

The terms are x=1, y-d=3-6=-3, z-2d=5-12= -7.

The median of 1, -3, -7 is -3. So a=-3. sum is |-3 -1|=4, |-3+6 -3|=0, |-3+12 -5|=4. Sum 8.

Which matches the example's output. So candidate1 sum is 8.

But in that example, the optimal is candidate 3 or 4.

But the minimal sum is 8, which is correct.

So, in code, compute this candidate's sum.

For candidate2:

x'=x (sorted x). y' = max(y, x +d). z' = max(z, y' +d). So sum is:

|x -x| + |y' -y| + |z' -z| →0 + (y' -y if y' >y else 0) + (z' -z if z' >z else 0).

But wait, no. Because the movement could be either positive or negative. For example, if y' is less than y, then the movement would be y - y', but since y' is max(y, x +d), then y' >= y. So in this case, sum for y' is y' -y.

Similarly, z' is max(z, y' +d). So if y' +d > z, then z' is y' +d. Otherwise, z' is z. So sum for z' is (y' +d -z) if y' +d >z else 0.

So the sum for candidate2 is (y' -y) + max(0, y' +d -z).

But since y' = max(y, x +d), then:

sum_candidate2 = max(0, max(y, x +d) - y) + max(0, max(y, x +d) +d - z).

But since max(y, x +d) is either y (if x +d <=y) or x +d (otherwise), we can split into cases.

For example, if x +d <= y: then y' =y. sum for y' is 0. z' = max(z, y +d). sum is max(0, y +d - z).

If x +d >y: then y' =x +d. sum for y' is (x +d -y). z' = max(z, x + 2d). sum is (x +d -y) + max(0, x +2d - z).

Similarly for candidate3:

z' =z. y' is min(y, z -d). x' is min(x, y' -d).

sum_candidate3 = |x' -x| + |y' -y| + 0.

But since y' is min(y, z -d), and x' is min(x, y' -d).

So if z -d >=y → y' =y. x' = min(x, y -d).

sum is |x' -x| + 0.

If z -d <y → y' =z -d. x' = min(x, (z -d) -d) = min(x, z - 2d).

sum is |min(x, z-2d) -x| + (y - (z-d)) → since y' =z-d <y → |y' -y| = y - (z-d).

For candidate4:

y' =y. x' is min(x, y -d). z' is max(z, y +d).

sum is |x' -x| + 0 + |z' -z|.

So x' is min(x, y -d). If x <= y -d →x' =x. sum is 0. z' is max(z, y +d). sum is max(0, y +d -z).

Else, x' =y -d. sum is (x - (y -d)). z' is max(z, y +d). sum is (x - y +d) + max(0, y +d -z).

So in code, compute each candidate's sum.

So the approach is to generate all four candidates and choose the minimal sum.

But there might be other candidates. For example, perhaps leaving x and z as is, and adjusting y to be at least x +d and z >= y +d.

But in this case, if x and z are fixed, then y must be in [x +d, z -d]. If the original y is already in that interval, then sum is zero. Otherwise, adjust y to the nearest end.

But this is covered by candidate4.

So after considering all four candidates, the minimal sum is the answer.

So in code:

Sort the input a, b, c into x, y, z.

Compute the four candidates:

Candidate1: sum when arranged as a line spaced d apart.

Compute a as the median of x, (y -d), (z - 2d). Then x' =a, y' =a +d, z'=a +2d. Sum is |x -a| + |y - (a +d)| + |z - (a +2d)|.

Candidate2: x'=x. y' = max(y, x +d). z' = max(z, y' +d). Sum is (y' -y) + (z' -z).

Candidate3: z'=z. y' = min(y, z -d). x' = min(x, y' -d). Sum is (x' -x) + (y - y').

But since y' can't be larger than y (because we take min(y, ...)), then y - y' is positive or zero. So sum is |x' -x| + (y - y').

Wait, no. Because x' is min(x, y' -d). So if x <= y' -d, then x' =x → |x' -x|=0. Else, x' =y' -d → sum is (y' -d -x) → since x was larger than y' -d.

So sum is max(0, y' -d -x) if x > y' -d. But it's easier to compute as |x' -x|.

So sum for candidate3 is |x' -x| + (y - y').

Candidate4: y'=y. x' = min(x, y -d). z' = max(z, y +d). Sum is |x' -x| + |z' -z|.

Compute all four candidate sums, take the minimal.

Then, the answer is the minimal of these four sums.

So in code:

x, y, z = sorted([a, b, c])

Then compute each candidate:

For candidate1:

median_a = median of [x, (y -d), (z - 2*d)]

sum1 = abs(x - median_a) + abs(y - (median_a +d)) + abs(z - (median_a + 2*d))

For candidate2:

y2 = max(y, x +d)

z2 = max(z, y2 +d)

sum2 = (y2 - y) + (z2 - z)

For candidate3:

y3 = min(y, z -d)

x3 = min(x, y3 -d)

sum3 = (x - x3) if x3 <x else (x3 -x) → abs(x3 -x) + (y - y3)

sum3 = abs(x3 - x) + (y - y3)

For candidate4:

x4 = min(x, y -d)

z4 = max(z, y +d)

sum4 = abs(x4 -x) + (z4 -z)

Then, the answer is the minimum of sum1, sum2, sum3, sum4.

But wait, candidate3's sum is (x3 -x) if x3 >x else (x -x3) plus (y -y3). But since y3 is min(y, z -d), y3 can be <=y. So y - y3 is >=0.

Similarly for other candidates.

But how to compute this in code.

Testing this approach with the previous examples:

First example:

Input:5 2 6 3 → sorted x=2, y=5, z=6. d=3.

Candidate1:

a is median of x=2, y-d=5-3=2, z-2d=6-6=0 → sorted 0,2,2 → median 2. So a=2.

sum1= |2-2| + |5- (2+3)| + |6- (2+6)| →0 +0 + |6-8|=2 → sum 0+0+2=2.

Candidate2: x'=2. y'=max(5, 2+3=5) →5. z'=max(6,5+3=8) →8. sum2= (5-5)+(8-6)=0+2=2.

Candidate3: z'=6. y'=min(5,6-3=3). y'=3. x'=min(2,3-3=0) →0. sum3= (2-0)+(5-3)=2+2=4.

Candidate4: y'=5. x'=min(2,5-3=2) →2. z'=max(6,5+3=8) →8. sum4=0 + (8-6)=2.

So sum1=2, sum2=2, sum3=4, sum4=2. Minimal is 2.

Which is correct.

Second example:

Input:3 1 5 6 → sorted x=1, y=3, z=5. d=6.

Candidate1:

a is median of 1, 3-6=-3, 5-12=-7 → sorted [-7, -3, 1] → median is -3.

sum1= |1 - (-3)| + |3 - (-3 +6)| + |5 - (-3 +12)| →4 + 0 + |5 -9|=4 → sum 4+0+4=8.

Candidate2: x'=1. y'=max(3,1+6=7) →7. z'=max(5,7+6=13). sum2=7-3=4 +13-5=8 → sum 12.

Candidate3: z'=5. y'=min(3,5-6=-1) →-1. x'=min(1, -1 -6=-7) →-7. sum3= |1 - (-7)|=8 + (3 - (-1))=4 → sum 12.

Candidate4: y'=3. x'=min(1,3-6=-3) →-3. z'=max(5,3+6=9) →9. sum4= |1 - (-3)|=4 +9-5=4 → sum 8.

So sum1=8, sum2=12, sum3=12, sum4=8. Minimal is 8.

Which is correct.

Third example:

Input:8 3 3 2 → sorted x=3, y=3, z=8. d=2.

Candidate1:

a is median of 3, 3-2=1, 8-4=4. Sorted 1,3,4. median is 3.

sum1= |3-3| + |3 -5| + |8 -5| →0 +2 +3=5.

Candidate2: x'=3. y'=max(3,3+2=5) →5. z'=max(8,5+2=7) →8. sum2=5-3=2 +8-8=0 → sum 2.

Candidate3: z'=8. y'=min(3, 8-2=6) →3. x'=min(3,3-2=1) →3. sum3=0 +0 →0+ (3-3)=0. sum3=0.

But wait, sum3 is |x3 -x| + (y -y3). x3=min(3,3-2=1) →1. x is 3. So |1-3|=2. y is 3, y3=3. So sum3=2 + (3-3)=2. Wait, that's not right.

Wait for candidate3:

y' = min(y, z -d) → y=3, z -d=8-2=6. So y'=3.

x' = min(x, y' -d) → min(3,3-2=1) →1.

sum3= |1-3|=2 + (3-3)=0 → sum 2.

So sum3 is 2.

Candidate4: y'=3. x'=min(3,3-2=1) →1. z'=max(8,3+2=5) →8. sum4= |3-1|=2 + (8-8)=0 → sum2.

So candidate2 sum is 2, candidate3 sum is 2, candidate4 sum is 2. So minimal is 2.

But the correct output is 2. So the minimal among the four candidates is 2.

But what about candidate2's sum:

x'=3. y'=max(3,3+2=5) →5. sum2=5-3=2. z'=max(8,5+2=7) →8. sum2=2 +0=2.

Yes. So the minimal sum is 2.

Fourth example:

Input:2 3 10 4 → sorted x=2, y=3, z=10. d=4.

Candidate1:

a is median of 2, 3-4=-1, 10-8=2. Sorted [-1, 2, 2] → median is 2.

sum1= |2-2|=0 + |3-(2+4)|=3-6=3 → abs(3-6)=3 → sum1=0 +3 + |10 -10|=3. Total sum 3.

Candidate2: x'=2. y'=max(3, 2+4=6) →6. sum2=6-3=3. z'=max(10,6+4=10) →10. sum2=3 +0=3.

Candidate3: z'=10. y'=min(3, 10-4=6) →3. x'=min(2,3-4=-1) →-1. sum3= |2 - (-1)|=3 + (3-3)=0 →3.

Candidate4: y'=3. x'=min(2,3-4=-1) →-1. z'=max(10,3+4=7) →10. sum4= |2-(-1)|=3 +0 →3.

So all candidates sum to 3. So the minimal is 3, which matches the example.

So the approach seems to work.

Thus, the code should compute all four candidates and take the minimal.

Now, the code.

First, sort the a, b, c into x, y, z.

Then compute the four candidates.

For candidate1:

We need to compute the median of x, y -d, z-2d.

In Python, to find the median of three numbers:

def median(a, b, c):
    return sorted([a, b, c])[1]

So for a, b, c being x, y-d, z-2d:

median_val = sorted([x, (y -d), (z - 2*d)])[1]

sum1 = abs(x - median_val) + abs(y - (median_val +d)) + abs(z - (median_val + 2*d))

For candidate2:

y2 = max(y, x +d)

z2 = max(z, y2 +d)

sum2 = (y2 - y) + (z2 - z)

For candidate3:

y3 = min(y, z -d)

x3 = min(x, y3 -d)

sum3 = abs(x3 - x) + (y - y3)

For candidate4:

x4 = min(x, y -d)

z4 = max(z, y +d)

sum4 = abs(x4 -x) + (z4 - z)

Finally, the answer is the minimal sum among sum1, sum2, sum3, sum4.

But wait, what about cases where the candidates generate positions that do not satisfy the constraints?

For example, candidate3's x3 is min(x, y3 -d). But y3 is min(y, z -d).

So x3 <= y3 -d.

Which ensures that x3 <= y3 -d.

But y3 <= z -d.

And z is fixed. So x3 <= y3 -d <= (z -d) -d = z-2d.

But how does this affect the constraints?

x3 is <= y3 -d.

y3 is <= z -d.

So, x3 <= y3 -d <= z -d -d = z-2d.

But since z' is fixed as z, then z >= y3 +d.

Yes.

So candidate3's arrangement satisfies the constraints.

Thus, all four candidates generate valid positions that meet the constraints.

Therefore, the code can safely compute these four candidates and take the minimal sum.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

The code should read a, b, c, d from input, sort them into x, y, z, compute the four candidates, and output the minimal.

Let's code this step by step.

Read the input as four integers:

a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = sorted([a, b, c])

Compute the four sums:

# Candidate1: line arrangement with spacing d.
median_val = sorted([x, y -d, z - 2*d])[1]
sum1 = abs(x - median_val) + abs(y - (median_val +d)) + abs(z - (median_val +2*d))

# Candidate2: x is fixed, y and z adjusted.
y2 = max(y, x +d)
z2 = max(z, y2 +d)
sum2 = (y2 - y) + (z2 - z)

# Candidate3: z is fixed, y and x adjusted.
y3 = min(y, z -d)
x3 = min(x, y3 -d)
sum3 = abs(x3 - x) + (y - y3)

# Candidate4: y is fixed, x and z adjusted.
x4 = min(x, y -d)
z4 = max(z, y +d)
sum4 = abs(x4 - x) + (z4 - z)

# Compute the minimal sum.
result = min(sum1, sum2, sum3, sum4)

print(result)

    a, b, c, d = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

Candidate3: y3=min(3,10-4=6) →3. x3= min(2,3-4=-1) →-1. sum3=3 +0 →3.

Candidate4: x4= min(2,3-4=-1) →-1. sum4=3. z4= max(10,7) →10. sum4=3+0=3.

Result is 3.

All examples are handled correctly.

So the code is correct.
</think>

```python
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
x, y, z = sorted([a, b, c])

# Candidate 1: Line arrangement spaced exactly d apart
median_val = sorted([x, y - d, z - 2 * d])[1]
sum1 = abs(x - median_val) + abs(y - (median_val + d)) + abs(z - (median_val + 2 * d))

# Candidate 2: Fix x, adjust y and z
y2 = max(y, x + d)
z2 = max(z, y2 + d)
sum2 = (y2 - y) + (z2 - z)

# Candidate 3: Fix z, adjust y and x
y3 = min(y, z - d)
x3 = min(x, y3 - d)
sum3 = abs(x3 - x) + (y - y3)

# Candidate 4: Fix y, adjust x and z
x4 = min(x, y - d)
z4 = max(z, y + d)
sum4 = abs(x4 - x) + (z4 - z)

print(min(sum1, sum2, sum3, sum4))
```
