Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the task is to reverse a string by only swapping adjacent characters and find the minimum number of swaps required. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that each swap is between neighboring elements, and we need to find the minimal number of swaps to reverse the string. Wait, but reversing the string would mean that each character needs to move to the position that's mirrored around the center. For example, the first character moves to the last position, the second to the second last, and so on. So, the reversed string is the original string in reverse order.

But how do the swaps translate into moving characters to their positions? Each swap can move a character one position to the left or right. The total number of swaps required for a single character to move from position i to position j (assuming i < j) would be j - i swaps if we can move it directly. But since other characters are also moving, there's some interaction here. So the problem is similar to inversion counts, perhaps?

Wait, maybe there's a way to model this as the number of inversions needed. Because when you reverse the string, each character in the original string has to end up in a position where all the characters that were after it in the original are now before it. Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let's think: the original string is s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1}. The reversed string is s_{n-1}, s_{n-2}, ..., s_0. So each character s_i in the original has to end up in position n-1 - i in the reversed string.

Now, the order in which the characters are moved might affect the total number of swaps. For example, moving a character from position i to position n-1-i would require (n-1-i - i) swaps if there's a straight path. But when multiple characters are moving, their paths can interfere, leading to additional swaps. So how can we model this?

Another approach: the minimal number of swaps required to transform the original string into the reversed string is equal to the number of inversions needed when considering the positions of the characters in the reversed string. Wait, inversions here mean the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j but in the target arrangement, the element at i comes before the element at j in the original. Or perhaps, the problem is similar to finding the number of swaps required to permute the original into the reversed string, which is the same as the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original to the reversed string.

Yes! Because when you need to sort a permutation, the minimal number of adjacent swaps required is equal to the number of inversions in the permutation. So in this case, the reversed string is a permutation of the original string (since it's just reversed). Wait, but the reversed string is a specific permutation. So if we model the problem as permuting the original string into the reversed string, then the minimal number of adjacent swaps needed is equal to the number of inversions in the permutation that takes the original indices to their target indices.

But wait, the reversed string may not be a permutation of the original if there are duplicate characters. Oh, but the problem allows the characters to be rearranged as long as the end result is the reversed string. Wait no: the reversed string is exactly the original string reversed. So for example, if the original is 'abc', the reversed is 'cba'. So the problem is to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps required to turn the original string into the reversed string.

But how do we model this? Let's think of the reversed string as the target, and we need to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps needed to convert the original into the target. This is equivalent to finding the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original positions to the target positions. But this only holds if the target is a permutation of the original. Oh right, but the reversed string is just a rearrangement of the original's characters. So the problem reduces to finding the permutation that takes the original to the reversed string and computing the inversion count of that permutation.

But how do we model this permutation? Let's see. For each character in the original string, we need to find where it goes in the reversed string. For example, in the original string, the first character (s_0) must end up at position n-1 in the reversed string. The second character (s_1) must end up at position n-2, and so on. So the permutation π is such that π(i) = n-1 - i. But this is a specific permutation, and the inversion count here would be (n-1)*n/2, but that's not the case. Wait, no. For example, in the second test case, the input is 'cbaabc', which when reversed is 'cbaabc' again. So the permutation is the identity, and the inversion count is 0, which matches the sample output.

But the problem allows for duplicate characters. So when characters are the same, their order in the reversed string might not require as many swaps. For example, the first sample input is 'aaaza' which reversed is 'azaaa'. The sample output is 2. How does that happen?

In the first sample, original s is 'a a a z a' (indices 0-4). Reversed is 'a z a a a' (indices 4-0). So each character in the original needs to be moved to position 4 - i. But let's see:

Original positions (0-4): a(0), a(1), a(2), z(3), a(4). Reversed: a(4), z(3), a(2), a(1), a(0). So the target is 'a z a a a'.

Wait, but how to model the permutation. Let's list the characters in reversed order: the original reversed string is s[::-1], which is 'azaaa'.

So the target is s[::-1]. So for each character in the original string s, when building the target, each position i in the target corresponds to the original s[n-1 - i].

So the problem is: transform s into s[::-1] via adjacent swaps. The minimal number of swaps is the inversion count between the original sequence and the target sequence.

But inversion count here is the number of inversions in the permutation that takes the original positions to the target positions. Wait, but each character in the original may have to be mapped to a specific position in the target. But when there are duplicate characters, there's ambiguity. For example, in the original, if there are multiple 'a's, how do we know which 'a' in the original corresponds to which 'a' in the target to minimize the number of inversions?

Ah! Right, because when there are duplicates, the order in which we process them can affect the total inversion count. For example, if the target has two 'a's that can be matched with two 'a's in the original, arranging them in a certain order might lead to a lower inversion count.

So the key is to assign each character in the original to the corresponding character in the reversed string in such a way that the total inversions (the number of swaps needed) is minimized.

So how to model this? Let's think of the target string as the reversed string. For each character in the original string, we need to find their positions in the reversed string. However, when there are duplicates, the positions are not unique, and we need to choose which occurrence of a character in the original maps to which occurrence in the reversed string. The goal is to choose such a mapping that the inversion count (the number of pairs i < j where the original's i-th character is mapped to a position after the original's j-th character's mapped position) is minimized.

Wait, that's exactly the problem of finding the minimal inversion count when matching elements with duplicates. This is similar to the problem where you have two arrays with the same multiset of elements, and you want to find a permutation of the second array such that the inversion count between the original indices and the new positions is minimized.

In such cases, the optimal strategy is to process the elements in such a way that for each element in the original, the earliest possible occurrence in the target is used. Wait, no. Wait, when the target is the reversed string, each character in the original needs to be matched to a position in the reversed string. For example, the original's first character (position 0) must be placed at position n-1 in the target. The original's second character (position 1) must be placed at position n-2, etc. But in the target, each character in position i is s_rev[i] = s[n-1-i]. So the target is fixed as the reversed string.

Wait, no. Wait, the reversed string is the target. So the target is fixed. So for example, if the original is 'abc', the target is 'cba'. So the target is fixed. The problem is to rearrange the original string into the target string with adjacent swaps, and find the minimal number of swaps needed.

But the original and target might have the same multiset of characters. So how is this possible? Because each character in the original must be moved to the corresponding position in the target.

So the problem is equivalent to finding the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original indices to their positions in the target string. However, when there are duplicate characters in the target, the permutation is not uniquely defined. For example, if in the target, there are multiple 'a's, then when multiple 'a's are present in the original, which 'a's go where in the target? The choice here affects the inversion count.

Wait, but the target is the reversed string. So each character in the target is s_reversed[i] = s_original[n-1 - i]. So for example, the target's first character is s_original's last character, the target's second character is s_original's second last character, etc.

Wait, no. Wait, the target string is s[::-1], which is the reversed original. So the target is a specific string. So the problem is to transform the original into this exact target. So each character in the target must be in a specific position. For example, in the first sample, the target is 'azaaa'. So the first character must be 'a' (which is the last character of the original), the second must be 'z' (the fourth character of the original, which was at index 3), etc.

Wait, but the original's last character is 'a' (index 4). So in the target, this 'a' is at position 0. The original's index 3 is 'z', which is at position 1 in the target. The original's index 2 is 'a' (position 2 in the target), index 1 is 'a' (position 3 in target), index 0 is 'a' (position 4 in target). So the target is made up of the characters of the original in reverse order.

So each character in the target is a character from the original, but in reverse order. So the problem is to arrange the original's characters into the target's order, which is the reversed original. The minimal number of swaps is the inversion count between the original and the target, but taking into account that for each character in the target, we need to map it to the original's corresponding position.

But how do we model this?

Let me think of the problem as: the target is the reversed original. So for each index i in the target (from 0 to n-1), the target's character at i is s_original[n-1 - i]. So the target is the reversed string.

We need to model the permutation that takes each character in the original and moves it to the target's position. However, if there are duplicate characters, like in the first sample, how to assign which 'a' from the original goes where in the target to minimize the inversion count.

For example, in the first sample, the original is 'a a a z a' (indices 0-4), reversed is 'a z a a a' (indices 4,3,2,1,0). So the target is the reversed string. So the original's index 4 (a) is at position 0 in the target. Original index 3 (z) is at position 1. Original index 2 (a) at position 2. Original index 1 (a) at position 3. Original index 0 (a) at position 4.

So in this case, the target is formed by taking the original's characters in reverse order. So each character in the original is moved to the position in the target that is the reversed index. But when the original has duplicate characters, like multiple 'a's, their positions in the target are fixed. So for example, the 'a' in original position 4 (the last character) is at position 0 in the target. The 'a' in original position 0 is at position 4 in the target.

But when the original has multiple same characters, how do we track which original character ends up where in the target? Because the problem requires that the final string is exactly the reversed original. So each original character must be moved to the target's position. For instance, in the first sample, the original's first 'a' (index 0) must be moved to position 4 (the last in the target). The 'a' at index 4 must be moved to position 0. The 'a's at indexes 1 and 2 must be moved to positions 3 and 2, respectively. The 'z' at index 3 is moved to position 1.

So the permutation is a specific one: each original position i is mapped to target position j = n-1 - i. So the permutation is π(i) = n-1 -i. But then the inversion count of this permutation is (n-1)*n/2 - (sum over i of π(i)) ). Wait, no. The inversion count is the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and π(i) > π(j). Let's compute that for permutation π(i) = n-1 -i.

For example, if n=5, π is 4,3,2,1,0. The inversion count is 4+3+2+1 = 10. But in the first sample, the answer is 2. So this approach is not correct. Therefore, there's a misunderstanding here.

So perhaps the permutation approach is not correct because the problem allows for moving the characters in any way as long as the end result is the reversed string, but when there are duplicates, there are multiple ways to permute the characters to reach the reversed string, each with a different inversion count. The minimal number of swaps is the minimal possible inversion count among all possible permutations that form the reversed string.

Ah! Right. So the problem is not to find the inversion count of the permutation that reverses each character's position, but to find the minimal possible inversion count among all permutations that result in the reversed string. Because when there are duplicate characters, multiple permutations can lead to the same reversed string, and we need the one with the least inversion count.

So for example, in the first sample, the original is 'aaaza' (n=5). The reversed is 'azaaa'. The possible permutations that create 'azaaa' from the original's characters can vary in how the 'a's are arranged. For instance, which 'a's are moved to which positions. The minimal inversion count among all such permutations is the answer.

So the problem reduces to: find the permutation of the original string that results in the reversed string, and which has the minimal number of inversions (adjacent swaps needed). The inversion count here is the minimal possible.

This is equivalent to finding the inversion count when building the reversed string from the original by mapping each character in the original to a position in the reversed string, such that the inversion count is minimized.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of swaps when the target is a certain permutation and there are duplicates. The solution approach for such cases is to process the characters from right to left and assign the closest possible occurrence of the same character in the original to the current target position.

So here's the plan:

1. The target string is the reversed original. So for each position i in the target, the required character is s_rev[i] = original[n-1 -i].

But wait, the reversed original is s[::-1]. So the target is fixed. So the required character at each position i is the original's character at position n-1 -i. So the target is s_reversed = s[::-1].

But to form s_reversed from the original, the characters of the original must be rearranged to exactly match s_reversed. So when there are duplicates in the original, the same characters can be arranged in different orders as long as the final string is s_reversed.

Wait, no. Because s_reversed is the exact reversed string. So the target is fixed. So for example, if the original is 'aaaza', the reversed is 'azaaa', which is fixed. So the problem is to rearrange the original's characters into this exact string. So each character in the original must be moved to the position that makes the reversed string.

But how does that work when there are multiple same characters? For instance, in the original 'aaaza' (indices 0:a,1:a,2:a,3:z,4:a), the reversed is 'azaaa' (indices 0:a,1:z,2:a,3:a,4:a). So the first character in the reversed is the original's index 4. The second is original's 3. Third is original's 2. Fourth is original's 1. Fifth is original's 0. So the reversed string is a specific arrangement. So the problem is to move each original's character to a specific position. For example, the original's index 4's 'a' must be moved to position 0. Original's index 3's 'z' must be moved to position 1. Original's index 2's 'a' must be moved to position 2. Original's index 1's 'a' must be moved to position 3. Original's index 0's 'a' must be moved to position 4. So the permutation is fixed as π(i) = n-1 - i. However, in this case, the inversion count for π would be 4+3+2+1+0=10, but the sample's answer is 2. So clearly, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the sample's answer is 2. How is that possible? Because the sample's input is 'aaaza' and the reversed is 'azaaa'. So the minimal number of swaps is 2. So according to the permutation π(i) = n-1 -i, which would require 10 swaps, but the actual answer is 2. So there must be a different permutation that achieves the same target with fewer inversions. How?

Ah! Because the target is the reversed string, but when there are multiple same characters, they can be arranged in any order among their positions. So the problem is not to follow the permutation π(i) = n-1 -i, but to arrange the characters such that the target string is the reversed original, but allow the same characters to be placed in any order that matches the target. So the key is to find the permutation of the original's characters that matches the reversed string, and which has the minimal inversion count.

But how? Let's see. For example, in the first sample, the reversed string is 'azaaa'. So the target is a string where the first character is 'a', the second is 'z', followed by three 'a's. So the original's 'a's must be arranged in a way that the 'z' is at position 1, and the rest are 'a's. But since all the 'a's in the original are the same, their order in the target can vary. Wait no, because the target is exactly the reversed string. So the 'a's must be arranged exactly as they appear in the reversed string. For example, the reversed string in the first sample is 'azaaa', which has 'a' at position 0, 'z' at 1, then 'a's at 2,3,4. So the original's 'a's must be moved into positions 0,2,3,4, and 'z' into 1. So the problem is that the target is fixed, but the same characters can be placed in any order as long as the target is matched. Wait no. The target is fixed. So the positions of the characters in the target are fixed. For example, in the first sample, the target is 'a z a a a'. So the 'z' must be in position 1, and the other positions are 'a's. But the order of the 'a's in the target (positions 0,2,3,4) doesn't matter as long as they are 'a's. Wait, but the target is the reversed original. So the original string's reversed is the target. So the target's 'a's are exactly the same as the original's 'a's, but in reverse order. But since the characters are the same, the order among them in the target may not affect the outcome. So, for example, in the target, as long as there's a 'z' in position 1 and 'a's elsewhere, the arrangement of 'a's can vary. But that's not the case. Because the target is the reversed original. So the target's 'a's are in the same order as the original's 'a's, but reversed. So for example, if the original is 'a1 a2 a3 z a4' (positions 0-4), then the reversed is 'a4 z a3 a2 a1'. So the target must be 'a4 z a3 a2 a1'. Therefore, each 'a' in the original must be placed in a specific position in the target. But since they are all 'a's, how do we track their movement?

Ah, here's the problem: when the original and target have multiple identical characters, the order in which they are placed in the target affects the inversion count. For example, in the first sample, the original is 'a a a z a', reversed is 'a z a a a'. So the target's 'a's are the original's 'a's in reverse order. So the first 'a' in the target is the original's fifth character (index 4), the third 'a' is original's third character (index 2), etc. So to form the target, the original's 'a' at index 4 must be moved to position 0, the original's 'z' at 3 to position 1, the original's 'a' at 2 to position 2, original's 'a' at 1 to position 3, and original's 'a' at 0 to position 4. But in this case, the permutation is π(i) = n-1 -i, and the inversion count is indeed 10. But the sample's answer is 2. So this suggests that the permutation is not π(i) = n-1 -i.

So this implies that there's a different way to assign the original's 'a's to the target's 'a's such that the total inversion count is minimized. For instance, perhaps the 'a's can be rearranged in a way that requires fewer swaps.

Wait, perhaps the 'a's in the original can be considered as indistinct. So when the target has multiple 'a's, we can arrange the original's 'a's in any order among those positions, leading to a lower inversion count.

Yes! Because the 'a's in the target are all the same, we can choose which original 'a' goes to which position in the target's 'a's, as long as the 'z' is in the correct position. The goal is to choose this assignment to minimize the inversion count.

So the approach is to model the problem as follows:

For each character in the target (from left to right), we need to select which occurrence of that character in the original is used. For example, the first character in the target is 'a', so we need to choose an 'a' from the original to place there. The choice of which 'a' to pick affects the inversion count. To minimize the total inversions, we should pick the rightmost possible 'a' in the original that hasn't been used yet. Because by choosing the rightmost available 'a', we minimize the number of elements that need to be moved past it, thus reducing the number of inversions.

So the algorithm is as follows:

1. For the target string (s_reversed), iterate from left to right (i from 0 to n-1).
2. For each position i in the target, which requires character c = s_reversed[i], find the corresponding occurrence in the original string. To minimize the inversion count, choose the rightmost occurrence of c in the original that hasn't been used yet. This is because selecting the rightmost available character leaves as many characters as possible to the left (which would contribute to inversions) for the remaining positions.
3. Once the original's index j is selected for the target's position i, the number of inversions contributed by this selection is the number of elements already processed (i.e., those in the original that were to the left of j and have already been moved to the target's left part) because those elements would have to cross over j during the swaps, contributing j - (number of elements already processed from the left of j) inversions.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the problem of counting the number of inversions by processing elements in reverse and using a Fenwick tree (BIT) to track the available positions.

Alternatively, here's a standard approach for this kind of problem: when there are duplicate characters, the optimal way to arrange them to minimize inversions is to process the target from right to left and assign the original's characters in a way that the earliest possible occurrence in the original is used. Wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let's think through an example.

In the first sample:

Original: positions 0-4: a a a z a (indices 0,1,2,3,4)
Reversed target: positions 0-4: a z a a a (characters from original's 4,3,2,1,0)

But if we can assign the 'a's in the target in a way that uses the original's 'a's in positions that are closer to their target positions, then the inversion count would be minimized.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model each character in the target and, for each occurrence of a character c in the target, find the corresponding occurrence in the original in reverse order and track their positions. Then the minimal inversion count is computed by the number of swaps needed to arrange the original into the target, considering the order in which the characters are mapped.

An efficient way to compute this is to:

1. Preprocess the original string to record the positions of each character. For each character c, keep a list of indices in the original where c occurs, sorted in reverse order (so that we can pop from the end efficiently).
2. For each position in the target (from left to right), take the character c, find the rightmost occurrence of c in the original that hasn't been used yet. Then, compute how many of the original's elements that are to the left of this position have already been used. The difference gives the number of swaps needed for this character.

But how to compute the number of elements to the left of j (the chosen original position) that have already been used. This can be done using a Fenwick Tree (BIT) that tracks the used positions.

Wait, here's the plan:

- For each character in the target, we need to find the corresponding position in the original. To minimize the inversion count, we should select the rightmost available occurrence of the character in the original. Because selecting a rightmost occurrence leaves as many characters to the left as possible (which may have been used already) which would contribute fewer inversions.

- For example, suppose in the original, we have multiple 'a's. When building the target, the first 'a' in the target should be the rightmost 'a' in the original. The next 'a' in the target should be the next rightmost 'a' in the original that's not yet used. And so on.

- Once we select a position j in the original for the current target position i, the number of inversions contributed by this selection is the number of positions in the original that are less than j and have already been selected. Because those elements would have been moved to the left of j, which requires j - (number of selected positions to the left) swaps. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let's think:

Each time we select a position j in the original, the number of elements that were to the left of j in the original and have already been selected (and thus are to the left in the target) is the count of selected elements in the original that are < j. Because those elements were processed earlier (since we process the target from left to right) and thus must have been moved to the left of j. But each such element contributes to the inversion count as j is moved to the left.

Alternatively, the inversion count for j is the number of elements that were processed before j and are located to the left of j in the original. Because for each such element, j comes after it in the original, but in the target, j's element comes before. So this creates an inversion pair. The total inversion count is the sum over all selected positions j of the number of elements already processed that are in positions < j in the original.

So the algorithm is:

1. For each character c in the original, maintain a list of indices where c occurs, sorted in reverse order (so that we can pop from the end to get the rightmost occurrence first).
2. For each character in the target string (from left to right), get the rightmost occurrence of c in the original (using the list from step 1), say position j.
3. The number of inversions contributed by this j is the number of positions already processed (i.e., selected) that are less than j. This can be computed using a Fenwick Tree that tracks the count of selected positions in the original.

So the steps are:

- Preprocess the original string to create a dictionary mapping each character to a list of indices (sorted in reverse order) where the character occurs.
- Initialize a Fenwick Tree (BIT) of size n to track the selected positions.
- Initialize the inversion count to 0.
- For each character c in the target (left to right):
   - Pop the last element (rightmost occurrence) from the list of indices for c. This gives j.
   - Query the Fenwick Tree for the sum of elements in [0, j-1]. This is the number of positions already selected that are less than j. Add this to the inversion count.
   - Update the Fenwick Tree to add j (mark it as selected).
- The total inversion count after processing all characters is the answer.

This makes sense. Let's test this approach against the first sample.

Sample 1:
n=5, s= 'aaaza' → reversed is 'azaaa'.

Original indices (0-based) for 'aaaza' are 0:a, 1:a, 2:a,3:z,4:a.

Reversed target is 'a z a a a' → characters in order: a, z, a, a, a.

Preprocessing:
For each character, list of indices (sorted in reverse order):
a: [4,3,2,1,0] → Wait, no. Original 'a's are at indices 0,1,2,4. The third 'a' is at index 2, then the next 'a's are at 1 and 0. Wait, wait: original string is 'a','a','a','z','a'. So 'a's are at 0,1,2,4. So the list for 'a' is sorted in reverse order: [4,2,1,0]. 'z' is at 3.

Processing the target's first character (a):

Pop the last element from 'a's list. The list is [4,2,1,0]. Wait, sorted in reverse order, so when we pop from the end, we get 0? No, the list is sorted in reverse order (descending), so when you pop from the end (the end of the list), it's the smallest. Wait, no. For example, if the list is sorted in reverse order, then the first element is the largest. So for 'a's in the original, the indices are 4,2,1,0. So the list is [4,2,1,0]. So when you pop from the end, you get 0. That's not right. Because we want to select the rightmost available occurrence of 'a' in the original. Wait, but the rightmost occurrence is 4. Then the next is 2, then 1, then 0.

Wait, the 'a's are at positions 0,1,2,4. So sorted in reverse order (descending) gives [4,2,1,0]. So the rightmost available 'a's are picked first. For example, when the target's first character is 'a', we pick the rightmost 'a' in the original (index 4). Then the next 'a's are at indices 2, then 1, then 0.

So in the first step, the target's first character is 'a'. We pop 4 from the 'a' list. Then, we query the Fenwick Tree for the sum of elements less than 4. Since no elements have been selected yet, this sum is 0. The inversion count is 0. Then we add 4 to the Fenwick Tree.

Second character in target is 'z'. The list for 'z' is [3]. Pop 3. The sum of elements <3 in the Fenwick Tree is the number of elements already selected (only 4) that are <3. So 0. Add 3 to the Fenwick Tree. Inversion count remains 0.

Third character is 'a'. The 'a' list is now [2,1,0]. Pop 0? No. Wait, the 'a' list is sorted in reverse order. After popping 4, the list is [2,1,0]. When we pop from the end (using list.pop()), which in Python, popping from a list's end (pop() removes the last element). So the list is [4,2,1,0], after popping 4, it becomes [2,1,0]. Then next pop() returns 0? No. Wait, list is [4,2,1,0]. When you pop the last element (0), the list becomes [4,2,1]. But in the first step, we have to pop the rightmost available 'a', which is index 4. Then, next 'a' is index 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the list structure wrong. Let's think again. For the original 'a's, the indices are 0,1,2,4. So sorted in reverse order (descending) gives [4,2,1,0]. So when we create a list for 'a' as [4,2,1,0], then to select the rightmost 'a', we need to take the largest index first. So for the first 'a' in the target, we take 4. For the next 'a's, we take 2, then 1, then 0.

So for the third character in the target (a), we select 2. Then, we check how many positions have been selected already (4 and 3) and are less than 2. There are none. So inversion count += 0. Add 2 to the Fenwick Tree.

Fourth character is 'a' → select 1. The positions already selected are 4,3,2. How many are less than 1? None. So inversion count +=0. Add 1.

Fifth character is 'a' → select 0. Already selected positions are 4,3,2,1. How many are less than 0? None. So inversion count +=0. Add 0.

Total inversion count is 0. But the sample's answer is 2. So this approach is not correct. So what's wrong here?

Wait, the sample's answer is 2. But according to this approach, the inversion count is zero. Which is impossible. So something is wrong with this reasoning.

Hmm. Let's re-examine the sample.

Sample 1:

Original: 'aaaza' (indices 0:a,1:a,2:a,3:z,4:a).

Reversed target: 'azaaa'.

The steps according to the approach:

Process each character in the target:

1. 'a' → select index 4. Inversion contribution: 0 (no elements processed yet). Add 4.
2. 'z' → select index 3. Inversion contribution: sum of elements <3 → elements selected are 4. So no. So 0. Add 3.
3. 'a' → select index 2. Now, sum of elements <2: elements are 4 and 3, which are not <2. So 0. Add 2. Inversion count is 0.
4. 'a' → select index 1. Sum elements <1: none. So 0. Add 1. Inversion count remains 0.
5. 'a' → select index 0. Sum elements <0: none. Add 0. Inversion count remains 0.

But the answer is 2. So this suggests that the algorithm is not correct.

But why?

Because the problem is to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps to turn the original into the target. The algorithm computes the inversion count as 0, but the sample's answer is 2. So this indicates that the approach is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Ah! Because the target is the reversed string, which is 'azaaa'. The original is 'aaaza'. To reach the target from the original, the 'z' needs to move from index 3 to index 1. The 'a' at index 4 moves to index 0, and the 'a's at 0,1,2 must move to positions 4,3,2, respectively.

Wait, in the target 'azaaa', the positions are:

0: a (original index 4)
1: z (original index 3)
2: a (original index 2)
3: a (original index 1)
4: a (original index 0)

So according to this mapping, the permutation is 4 → 0, 3 → 1, 2 → 2, 1 →3, 0 →4.

The inversion count for this permutation is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and π(i) > π(j).

Let's list the permutation indices:

Original indices (sorted as 0,1,2,3,4):

π(0) =4 (original index 0 → target position4)
π(1) =3 (original index 1 → target position3)
π(2) =2 (original index2 → target position2)
π(3) =1 (original index3 → target position1)
π(4) =0 (original index4 → target position0)

So the permutation array is [4,3,2,1,0]. The inversion count is 4+3+2+1=10. But sample answer is 2.

But the sample's answer is 2. So there's a discrepancy. So why?

Because the sample's answer is 2, which suggests that there's a different way to arrange the original's 'a's into the target's 'a's such that the inversion count is 2. For example, moving the 'z' from index3 to position1 requires two swaps, and the 'a's in positions4 and3 can be moved in a way that requires fewer swaps.

So the key is that the algorithm described earlier is not capturing the correct way to assign the 'a's to their target positions. Because the algorithm selects the rightmost available 'a' first, but perhaps this leads to a higher inversion count. Wait, but according to the algorithm, the inversion count would be zero. So the algorithm must be incorrect.

So perhaps the algorithm is not considering the correct order of assigning the original's characters to the target's positions.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be to process the target from right to left and assign the leftmost possible occurrence of the character in the original. Let's try this.

Alternative approach:

Process the target from right to left. For each character in the target's position i (starting from the end), choose the leftmost occurrence of c in the original that hasn't been used yet. Then, the inversion count is the number of elements to the right of the selected position that have already been processed.

But how to model this.

Let's think of the first sample again. The target is 'azaaa'. Processing from right to left:

Position4: 'a' → choose leftmost 'a' in original (index0). Inversion count is the number of elements already processed (none) → 0. Add 0 to the Fenwick Tree.

Position3: 'a' → choose leftmost remaining 'a' in original (index1). Elements already processed (0) and to the right of 1: 0. So inversion count +=0. Add 1.

Position2: 'a' → choose index2. Already processed elements are 0,1. Elements to the right of 2: none. So inversion count +=0. Add 2.

Position1: 'z' → choose index3. Elements already processed are 0,1,2. Sum of elements >3 in Fenwick Tree? No, 3 is the selected index. Wait, the inversion count is the number of elements already processed that are to the right of 3. There are none. So 0. Add3.

Position0: 'a' → choose index4. Already processed elements are 0,1,2,3. Sum of elements >4: none. So inversion count +=0. Total inversion count is 0. But the sample's answer is 2. So this approach also gives zero. Which is not correct.

So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the algorithm is not correctly capturing the number of swaps required. Because the minimal number of swaps is not the same as the inversion count computed by this approach.

But why? Let's think about the sample.

The sample's original string is 'a a a z a', which is:

Indices 0:a, 1:a, 2:a,3:z,4:a.

The reversed string is 'a z a a a'.

To get this, the required swaps are:

First, swap z (index3) with a (index4) → 'a a a a z' becomes 'a a a z a' (wait, no, original is 'aaaza', reversed is 'azaaa'. So the original is aaaza (a a a z a). The reversed is a z a a a. So how to transform the original into the reversed with swaps.

Sample's explanation:

They swap the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and3?), wait, perhaps the explanation is written with 1-based indices.

Wait, the sample's note says:

In the first example, you have to swap the third and the fourth elements, so the string becomes "aazaa". Then swap the second and third elements to get "azaaa".

Wait, the original is 'aaaza' (indices 0-4):

Original: positions 0:a,1:a,2:a,3:z,4:a.

After first swap (indices3 and4): string becomes a a a a z. Then swap indices2 and3: a a z a a. Then swap indices1 and2: a z a a a. But that's three swaps. But the sample's answer is 2. Wait, the sample says the output is 2. So this suggests that the sample's explanation is perhaps using 1-based indices.

Ah, right. The sample says that after swapping the third and fourth elements, the string becomes "aazaa". Then swapping the second and third elements gives "azaaa".

In 0-based indices, the first swap is between indices 2 and3 (elements a and z), resulting in a a z a a. Then swap indices 1 and2 (a and z), resulting in a z a a a. So two swaps. That's correct.

So the steps are:

Original: a a a z a → swap indices2 and3 → a a z a a → swap indices1 and2 → a z a a a.

So two swaps. So the inversion count is 2.

But according to the initial approach, the inversion count was computed as zero. So why?

Because the algorithm we are using is not capturing the correct inversion count. So there's a flaw in the algorithm's logic.

So why does the algorithm give zero when the correct answer is two?

Because the algorithm's way of selecting the original's indices for the target's positions is not correct. Let's see:

The algorithm processes the target from left to right. For each character in the target, it selects the rightmost available occurrence in the original. Then, the inversion count is the sum of the number of elements already selected that are less than the current j.

In the sample's case:

Target is 'a','z','a','a','a'.

Processing the first 'a' → select j=4. Fenwick Tree is empty. Inversion contribution 0.

Second 'z' → select j=3. Fenwick Tree has 4. The number of elements <3 is zero. Contribution 0. Total 0.

Third 'a' → select j=2. Fenwick Tree has 4,3. Number of elements <2: zero. Contribution 0. Total 0.

Fourth 'a' → select j=1. Fenwick Tree has 4,3,2. Elements <1: zero. Contribution 0. Total 0.

Fifth 'a' → select j=0. Fenwick Tree has 4,3,2,1. Elements <0: zero. Contribution 0. Total 0.

Total inversion count is 0. But the correct answer is 2. So the algorithm is wrong.

What's the mistake?

Ah, because the algorithm's way of selecting the original's indices for the target's positions is leading to a different permutation of the original's characters, which does not match the target. For example, the target is 'a z a a a', but the selected permutation would be:

target positions 0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, 4:0. Which gives the string 'a z a a a', which is correct. But the inversion count is 0. But in reality, moving these indices requires swaps.

Wait, this suggests that the algorithm's logic is incorrect. Because the inversion count computed by the algorithm is the number of elements already selected to the left of j. But the actual number of swaps required is the number of elements to the left of j that are not selected yet. Because each such element will have to be swapped past j's element as they are moved to the right.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm's logic is inverted. Because when you select j as the next element in the permutation, the number of elements that are to the left of j in the original and are yet to be selected will have to move to the right of j in the target. This would create swaps. So the number of swaps contributed by j is the number of elements to the left of j in the original that are selected after j. Which is the total number of elements to the left of j minus the number of elements to the left of j that are already selected.

Alternatively, the inversion count is the number of elements that appear before j in the original and are processed after j. Which is the number of elements to the left of j that are processed later. So the total inversion count is the sum over all j of (number of elements to the left of j in the original that are processed after j).

This is equivalent to the number of inversions in the permutation formed by the selected positions.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, when we select j for processing i-th in the target, any elements to the left of j that are selected later will contribute to inversions. So the total inversions is the sum for each j of the number of elements to the left of j in the original that are selected after j.

But how to compute this in O(n log n) time.

Another approach is to model the problem as a permutation, and compute the inversion count of this permutation. But how to construct the permutation.

The correct permutation must be such that the i-th character in the target is the j-th character in the original, and the order of the j's in the permutation is the order in which they are selected.

So in the first sample, the permutation is [4,3,2,1,0], which has inversion count 10. But sample's answer is 2, which implies that this permutation is not the one being used.

Ah! But this suggests that the sample's answer is not based on this permutation. So the problem is not to reverse the original string but to find any permutation of the original's characters that forms the reversed string, and which has the minimal inversion count.

But how?

The sample's answer suggests that there's a way to form the reversed string with fewer swaps. How?

The reversed string is 'azaaa'. The sample's explanation says that after two swaps, the string becomes 'azaaa'. Let's see:

Original is 'a a a z a'. After two swaps:

First swap the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3). Then swap indices 1 and 2.

Original is indexes 0-4: 0:a, 1:a, 2:a, 3:z,4:a.

After first swap (indices3 and4): string becomes 0:a,1:a,2:a,4:a,3:z → 'aaaaz'.

Then swap indices2 and3 (a and a) → no change. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the sample explanation uses 1-based indices.

If the first swap is between indices 3 and4 (elements z and a), then the string becomes 'aaaaz' → but then the next swap between indices 2 and3 (a and a) does nothing. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let's see the sample's explanation:

In the first example, you have to swap the third and the fourth elements, so the string becomes "aazaa". Then you have to swap the second and the third elements, so the string becomes "azaaa".

Ah, so in 1-based indices:

Original is a a a z a (positions 1-5).

Third and fourth elements are a and z. Swapping them gives a a z a a → "aazaa" (in 5 letters). Then swapping the second and third elements (a and z) gives a z a a a → "azaaa". So two swaps.

So the permutation is:

Original positions 1,2,3,4,5: a, a, a, z, a.

After swapping 3 and4: a, a, z, a, a.

Then swapping 2 and3: a, z, a, a, a.

The permutation of the original's indices is 0,1,3,2,4.

So the permutation array is [0,1,3,2,4], which maps to the target string. The inversion count of this permutation is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and permutation[i] > permutation[j]. In this case, permutation is [0,1,3,2,4]. The inversions are (3,2) → one inversion. So the inversion count is 1. But the sample's answer is 2. This suggests that the inversion count is not the same as the number of swaps. Hmm.

But wait, this permutation's inversion count is 1. But the sample's answer is 2. So this suggests that the inversion count is not the correct measure here. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the number of adjacent swaps needed to sort a permutation is equal to the number of inversions in that permutation. So if the permutation has one inversion, that would take one swap. But the sample's answer is two. So this is conflicting.

Ah, but in this case, the permutation is [0,1,3,2,4]. The inversion count is 1. But the sample required two swaps. So this suggests that the permutation's inversion count is not the correct way to model the problem.

So there's a fundamental error in the approach of using inversion count as the minimal number of swaps. Perhaps the initial approach is not correct.

This suggests that the problem is more complex than initially thought. So what's the correct approach?

Let's think again. The problem requires transforming the original string into the reversed string using adjacent swaps, and the minimal number of swaps is required. The minimal number of swaps is equal to the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original's indices to their positions in the target.

But when there are duplicate characters, the permutation is not unique. Therefore, the minimal inversion count among all possible valid permutations (those that result in the target string) is the answer.

So the problem reduces to finding the permutation of the original's characters that matches the target string and has the minimal inversion count.

To find this permutation, we need to assign the original's characters to the target's positions such that the resulting permutation has the minimal possible inversion count.

The key insight is to greedily assign the rightmost possible character in the original to the target's current position. This ensures that we have as few elements to the left of the current position as possible that will need to be processed later, thereby minimizing the number of inversions.

The algorithm using Fenwick Tree and processing from left to right in the target, selecting the rightmost available occurrence of each character in the original, and tracking the number of elements already processed to the left of the current position. This should compute the minimal inversion count.

But in the first sample, this approach gives zero, but the correct answer is 2. So why?

Because the algorithm's way of selecting the permutation is leading to a different permutation than the one used in the sample. Let's see what permutation is selected by the algorithm in the first sample:

The target is 'a','z','a','a','a'.

Processing each character:

1. 'a' → select rightmost 'a' in original (index4). Fenwick Tree is empty. Inversion count +=0. Add 4 to Fenwick Tree.
2. 'z' → select index3. Fenwick Tree has 4. Elements <3: 0. Inversion count +=0. Add3.
3. 'a' → select index2. Fenwick Tree has4,3. Elements <2:0. Add2. Inversion count 0.
4. 'a' → select index1. Fenwick Tree has4,3,2. Elements <1:0. Add1.
5. 'a' → select index0. Fenwick Tree has4,3,2,1. Elements <0:0. Add0.

The permutation is [4,3,2,1,0]. The inversion count of this permutation is 10. But the sample's answer is 2. So this suggests that the algorithm's approach is wrong.

So why is the sample's answer 2, but the algorithm gives 10?

Because the sample's solution involves a different permutation that results in the same target string but with a lower inversion count.

But how is that possible? Because the target string is fixed. How can there be multiple permutations of the original's characters that result in the same target string?

Ah! Because the original and target have duplicate characters. For example, in the first sample, the target's 'a's can be filled by any 'a's from the original, but in such a way that their order in the target is determined by their positions in the original. However, since the 'a's are the same, swapping their positions in the target doesn't change the resulting string. So multiple permutations can lead to the same target string, and we need to find the permutation with the minimal inversion count.

So the algorithm's approach of assigning the rightmost possible 'a' first is not the correct strategy for minimizing the inversion count. Instead, we need to assign the 'a's in a way that minimizes the number of swaps required.

So what's the correct way to assign the 'a's?

In the first sample's case, the target is 'a','z','a','a','a'. The 'z' must be at position1 in the target, which corresponds to the original's index3. The 'a's can be arranged in the remaining positions. The minimal number of swaps is achieved when the 'a's are arranged in such a way that their movement requires the fewest swaps.

So for the 'a's in the target's positions0,2,3,4:

- Position0: original index4 (a)
- Position2: original index2 (a)
- Position3: original index1 (a)
- Position4: original index0 (a)

This arrangement gives the permutation [4,3,2,1,0], which has inversion count 10. But the sample's explanation uses a different arrangement:

The 'a's in positions0 and4 are swapped, and the 'a's in positions1 and3 are swapped. This requires two swaps. But how does this fit into the permutation model?

Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm needs to process the characters in the target and assign the original's characters in such a way that the inversion count is minimized. But the previous approach of choosing the rightmost occurrence is not working.

Another idea is to process the target from right to left and assign the leftmost possible occurrence of the character in the original. This is the standard approach for problems where we need to minimize the number of swaps.

Let me try this approach for the first sample.

Processing the target from right to left:

Target's positions4 →0:

Position4: 'a' → select leftmost 'a' in original (index0). Add to Fenwick Tree. Inversion count is 0.

Position3: 'a' → select next leftmost 'a' (index1). Fenwick Tree has0. Number of elements already processed (0) that are to the right of 1: 0. So inversion count +=0. Add1.

Position2: 'a' → select index2. Fenwick Tree has0,1. Elements to the right of 2:0 and1 are to the left. So 0. Add2.

Position1: 'z' → select index3. Fenwick Tree has0,1,2. Elements to the right of3: none. So 0. Add3.

Position0: 'a' → select index4. Fenwick Tree has0,1,2,3. Elements to the right of4: none. So inversion count 0.

Total inversion count is 0. Again, not correct.

But the sample requires two swaps. So this approach also doesn't work.

So what's the correct approach?

Another idea is to realize that the minimal number of swaps is equal to the number of swaps required to reverse the string, but considering the relative positions of the characters. For each character that needs to move to the left, the number of swaps required is the number of characters that need to pass over it to the right.

But this feels vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the original and target positions.

Each character in the original must be moved to its target position in the reversed string. For characters that are the same, the order in which they are moved can affect the total number of swaps.

The minimal number of swaps is achieved by moving the characters in such a way that when a character is moved to its target position, it passes over as few characters as possible that are also being moved.

Thus, for characters that are the same, we should move them in the order that minimizes the number of times they have to pass over each other.

In the first sample, the 'z' needs to move from position3 to position1. This requires two swaps (moving left twice). The 'a' at position4 needs to move to position0. This requires four swaps (moving left four times). But when the 'a' at position4 is moved first, it would pass over the 'z' and the other 'a's. But if the 'z' is moved first, then the 'a' at position4 can be moved without passing over the 'z', reducing the total swaps.

So moving the 'z' first to position1 requires two swaps, and then moving the 'a's would require fewer swaps.

But how to model this for all characters?

The problem seems to require simulating the process for each character, but for large n (up to 2e5), we need an efficient algorithm.

Another idea is to note that the minimal number of swaps is the same as the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original's indices to their target's positions. But when there are duplicates, the permutation is not unique. Therefore, the minimal inversion count is achieved by choosing the permutation that orders the duplicates in such a way that their target positions are ordered in the same way as their original positions. This way, the inversion count is minimized.

This is similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of swaps when transforming one array into another array with duplicates. The solution is to assign each occurrence of a character in the original to the corresponding occurrence in the target in a way that minimizes the inversion count. This is done by processing the target from left to right and for each character, select the earliest possible occurrence in the original that hasn't been used yet.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct approach. Let's try.

For example, in the first sample:

Target is 'a','z','a','a','a'.

Processing left to right:

For the first 'a' in the target, select the first occurrence of 'a' in the original. But this would be index0. However, this would require moving it to position0, which is not possible. Or wait, the target's first 'a' is the original's fourth character (index4). So how to map this?

Alternatively, perhaps for each character in the target, we track the order in which they appear and assign the original's characters to the target's characters in the same order.

But I'm getting stuck.

Another approach is to realize that the problem is similar to the problem of transforming a string into another by adjacent swaps, where the other string is the reverse. The minimal number of swaps is the number of inversions between the original and the target, considering the target as a permutation of the original.

But the target is fixed as the reversed string. So the permutation is the one that reverses the order of the original's characters. However, when there are duplicates, the permutation may not be unique, and we need to find the permutation that leads to the minimal number of inversions.

This problem is known as the "minimum number of swaps to transform one array into another when there are duplicates". The standard approach for this is to process the array and assign the elements in a way that for each element in the target, we pick the corresponding element in the original array in such a way that the relative order is preserved as much as possible, thus minimizing the inversions.

The algorithm for this problem involves:

1. For each value, create a list of indices in the original array where the value occurs.
2. For each value in the target array, keep a pointer to the next available index in the original array for that value.
3. Iterate through the target array, and for each element, select the first occurrence of that element in the original array's list (starting from the pointer) such that the index is the smallest possible that hasn't been used yet.

This ensures that we process the elements in the order they appear in the target, thus minimizing the inversions.

But how to compute the inversion count for this permutation.

The key is to model the permutation as the one where for each element in the target, we select the earliest possible occurrence of that element in the original array. This leads to the minimal possible inversion count.

To compute this, we can use a Fenwick Tree to track the selected indices and calculate the number of elements already processed that are greater than the current index. This is because each such element would contribute to an inversion.

Wait, here's the correct approach:

For each character in the target (from left to right), select the leftmost occurrence of that character in the original that hasn't been used yet. Then, the number of inversions contributed by this selection is the number of elements already processed (selected) that are to the right of the current index. Because those elements have to be swapped past the current element to get to their positions.

For example, if we select an index j for the current target position, any elements that were already selected and are located to the right of j in the original will contribute to inversions. Because they have to be moved to the left of j in the target.

So the algorithm is:

1. For each character c in the original, store a list of indices in the original where c occurs. This list should be sorted in ascending order (left to right).
2. For each character in the target (processed left to right), find the leftmost occurrence of c in the original's list (using a pointer to track which indices have been used).
3. For each selected index j, the number of elements already processed that are greater than j (i.e., are to the right of j in the original) is the number of inversions contributed by j. This can be computed using a Fenwick Tree that tracks the processed indices.
4. Add j to the Fenwick Tree and accumulate the inversion count.

Let's test this approach on the first sample:

Sample1:

Original indices:0,1,2,3,4 → 'a','a','a','z','a'.

Target is 'a','z','a','a','a'.

Processing target left to right:

For the first 'a' in target:

The leftmost 'a' in original is 0. But we need to map this to the first 'a' in the target. But the first 'a' in the target is the original's index4. So this approach would not work.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The target is the reversed original. So the target is 'azaaa', which is s_reversed = 'a z a a a'. So for each position in the target, the required character is the original's reversed index.

But in the first sample, the target's first 'a' is the original's index4. So how can selecting the leftmost 'a' in the original's 'a's (0) help? Because this would require moving it to position0, which is the target's first position.

But the target's first position is supposed to be the original's index4.

Ah, this approach seems to be selecting the wrong indices for the target's positions. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

This is getting too confusing. Let's look for an alternative solution.

Looking up similar problems, I found that this problem is equivalent to finding the number of swaps needed to transform the original string into the reversed string. The minimal number of swaps is the number of inversions in the permutation that maps the original to the reversed string. However, when there are duplicate characters, the permutation is not unique. To find the minimal inversion count, we need to assign the characters in the original to the target in a way that preserves their relative order as much as possible.

The optimal way to do this is to process the target from left to right. For each character in the target, select the leftmost occurrence of that character in the original that hasn't been used yet. This ensures that we process the characters in the order of the target and minimize the number of elements to the right of the current index that have already been processed, thereby minimizing the inversions.

So the correct algorithm is:

1. For each character c in the original, collect their indices in a list, sorted in ascending order.
2. For each character in the target, from left to right:
   a. Find the first occurrence of c in the original's list of indices (using a pointer for each character's list to track used indices).
   b. The selected index j contributes a number of inversions equal to the number of already processed indices that are greater than j.
   c. Add j to the processed indices and update the Fenwick Tree.

Let's apply this to the first sample:

Original 'a's are at indices0,1,2,4. Sorted in ascending order: [0,1,2,4].

Original 'z' is at index3.

Target is 'a', 'z', 'a', 'a', 'a'.

Processing each character:

1. Target[0] is 'a'. Select leftmost available 'a' → 0. Number of processed indices >0:0 (no elements processed yet). Inversion count +=0. Add0 to Fenwick Tree.
2. Target[1] is 'z'. Select index3. Number of processed indices >3:0 (only 0 is processed, which is <3). Inversion count +=0. Add3.
3. Target[2] is 'a'. Select next leftmost 'a' →1. Number of processed indices (0,3) greater than1:1 (3). Inversion count +=1. Add1. Total inversion count is1.
4. Target[3] is 'a'. Select next leftmost 'a' →2. Number of processed indices (0,3,1) greater than2:1 (3). Inversion count +=1. Total is2. Add2.
5. Target[4] is 'a'. Select next leftmost 'a' →4. Number of processed indices (0,3,1,2) greater than4:0. Total remains 2. Add4.

Total inversion count is2, which matches the sample's answer.

So this approach works for the first sample. Let's test the second sample:

Sample2:

n=6, s='cbaabc'. Reversed is 'cbaabc' (a palindrome). So target is the same as the original. So the inversion count is0.

Processing each character:

All characters in target are same as original, so the selected indices are processed in order, and inversion count is0. So the answer is0.

Third sample:

Sample3: input is 'icpcsguru' (n=9). Reversed is 'urugsppci' (assuming the sample's output is 30). The approach should calculate the correct inversion count.

So the algorithm seems to work for the first sample when we select the leftmost occurrence of each character in the target.

Thus, the correct approach is to:

- Process the target from left to right.
- For each character in the target, select the leftmost occurrence of that character in the original that hasn't been used yet.
- For each selected index j, the number of already processed indices that are greater than j is added to the inversion count.
- Use a Fenwick Tree (BIT) to track the processed indices and efficiently compute the number of elements greater than j.

So the steps to implement this are:

1. Preprocess the original string to create a dictionary that maps each character to a list of indices (sorted in ascending order). For example, for 'aaaza', the 'a's are at [0,1,2,4], sorted in ascending order.

2. For each character in the target (which is the reversed original string), iterate from left to right.

3. For each character c in the target, find the leftmost index in the original's list for c that hasn't been used yet. This can be done using a pointer for each character's list.

4. Once the index j is selected, query the Fenwick Tree for the number of elements in the range [j+1, n-1], which is the number of already processed indices that are greater than j. This gives the number of inversions contributed by j.

5. Update the Fenwick Tree to include j.

6. Sum all the inversion contributions to get the total minimal number of swaps.

Now, let's implement this.

For the Fenwick Tree, we need to support two operations:

- Query the number of elements <= x (but wait, we need to count the number of elements >j. So the number of elements in [j+1, n-1] is equal to the total number of elements processed so far minus the number of elements <=j.

Alternatively, the Fenwick Tree can be used to track the count of elements <= x. Then, the number of elements >j is the current size of the Fenwick Tree (number of elements processed so far) minus the query(j).

So the Fenwick Tree will support:

- Update: add an index j.
- Query: sum of elements <= j.

Each time we process j, the number of elements already processed that are >j is (current size of Fenwick Tree (i elements processed) - query(j)).

But the current size is i+1 (since we are processing the i-th character). Wait, no. The current size is incremented after processing.

But the steps are:

For each character in the target (i from 0 to n-1):

   select j.

   inversions += (number of elements processed so far) - query(j).

   add j to the Fenwick Tree.

Yes. Because when processing the i-th character (0-based), the number of elements processed so far is i. Then, the number of elements >j is i - query(j).

So the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size n, and for each j, we add 1 at position j, and query the sum from 0 to j.

So the code would be:

for each c in reversed(s):
   get the leftmost occurrence of c in the original's list for c.
   inversions += (number of processed elements) - fenwick.query(j)
   fenwick.update(j, 1)
   processed_elements += 1

Wait, but reversed(s) is the target string. Or is the target string s[::-1]?

Yes, the target string is s[::-1]. So we process each character in the target string from left to right (i.e., the first character of the target is s[-1], the last character of the original).

So the code steps:

s = input().strip()
target = s[::-1]

We need to build for each character in the original s, a list of indices in sorted order. For example, for each c in s, a list of indices where s[i] == c, in increasing order.

Then, for each character in target (left to right), we pick the first available index from the corresponding list and compute the inversions.

So the code outline is:

from collections import defaultdict, deque

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()
target = s[::-1]

# Preprocess original string: for each character, list of indices in order.
char_indices = defaultdict(deque)
for i, c in enumerate(s):
    char_indices[c].append(i)

fenwick = FenwickTree(n)
inversion_count = 0

for c in target:
    # Get the leftmost index for c
    j = char_indices[c].popleft()
    # Number of elements processed so far: current_size = fenwick.size()
    current_size = fenwick.size()
    inversion_count += current_size - fenwick.query(j)
    fenwick.update(j, 1)

print(inversion_count)

But wait, the Fenwick Tree's size is tracked by the sum of all the elements added. So the Fenwick Tree should support the query of the sum of elements from 0 to j, and the update adds 1 to the j-th position.

Implementing a Fenwick Tree that can handle this.

The Fenwick Tree for this problem will have operations:

- update(pos, delta): add delta to the pos-th index.
- query(pos): returns the sum of elements from 0 to pos.

The number of elements processed so far is the sum of all updates (since each update adds 1). So current_size = fenwick.query(n-1).

But for efficiency, we can track the current_size separately as a variable, incrementing by 1 each time.

But perhaps it's better to track it as the sum of all elements in the Fenwick Tree.

But in the code, when we call fenwick.query(j), we get the number of elements <=j. So the number of elements >j is current_size - fenwick.query(j).

But current_size is the total number of elements added so far, which is the same as fenwick.query(n-1).

But since we are adding elements one by one, current_size can be tracked as a variable.

So the code should track current_size as a variable, incrementing by 1 after each update.

Alternatively, the Fenwick Tree can be used to track the count. So when we add j to the tree, it's represented as adding 1 to position j. Then, the sum from 0 to j gives the count of elements <=j.

So the code would be:

class FenwickTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.n = size
        self.tree = [0] * (self.n + 1)

    def update(self, idx, delta):
        idx += 1  # 1-based indexing
        while idx <= self.n:
            self.tree[idx] += delta
            idx += idx & -idx

    def query(self, idx):
        idx += 1  # 1-based indexing
        res = 0
        while idx > 0:
            res += self.tree[idx]
            idx -= idx & -idx
        return res

Then, for each j:

current_size = number of elements added so far.

When processing the i-th character (0-based), current_size is i. Because before processing it, i elements have been added.

So inversion_count += i - fenwick.query(j).

Wait, no. Let's say we process the first character (i=0). current_size is 0 before processing. After processing, current_size becomes 1.

But during processing, for i=0:

inversion_count += current_size (0) - fenwick.query(j) (0) → 0.

Then, after adding j, current_size becomes 1.

So the code should track the current_size as the number of elements added before processing the current character.

So:

current_size = 0

for c in target:
    j = ... 
    inversion_count += current_size - fenwick.query(j)
    fenwick.update(j, 1)
    current_size += 1

Yes.

So putting it all together:

The code should read n, s, reverse s to get the target. Preprocess the original's indices for each character. Then, for each character in the target, pick the leftmost index, compute the number of elements already processed and greater than j, add to inversion count.

Testing this on the first sample:

Sample1:

Original indices for 'a' are [0,1,2,4]. Stored in char_indices['a'] as deque([0,1,2,4]).

Processing target 'a','z','a','a','a'.

First 'a' in target:

j = 0. current_size is 0. inversion_count += 0 - query(0). query(0) is 0. inversion_count is 0. update j=0. current_size becomes1.

Second 'z' in target:

j=3. current_size is1. inversion_count +=1 - query(3). query(3) is0 (only j=0 is added). 1-0=1. inversion_count becomes1. update j=3. current_size=2.

Third 'a' in target:

j=1. current_size=2. query(1) is 1 (j=0 and j=1 is not added yet). So 2-1=1. inversion_count becomes2. update j=1. current_size=3.

Fourth 'a' in target:

j=2. current_size=3. query(2) is 1 (0 and1 are added). 3-1=2. inversion_count becomes2+2=4. No. Wait, no. query(2) is the sum of elements <=2. Which are j=0,1 added. So query(2) is 2.

Wait, after adding j=0,3,1:

After j=0: Fenwick Tree has 1 at 0.

After j=3: Fenwick Tree has 1 at 3.

After j=1: Fenwick Tree has 1 at 1.

So when processing j=2 (the third 'a' in target):

query(2) is sum of 0,1,2. But 2 hasn't been added yet. So sum is 0 (j=0) +1 (j=1) + 0 (j=2) → total 1.

So current_size is3.

inversion_count +=3 -1=2. inversion_count is1+2=3.

But the sample's answer is2. So this approach is not working.

Wait, no. Let's re-calculate.

Processing the third character (the third 'a' in target):

At this point, the current_size is2. The processed j's are0 and3.

The third character in the target is 'a', so we select j=1.

current_size is2.

query(1) returns the sum of elements <=1 in the Fenwick Tree. The Fenwick Tree contains j=0 and j=3. query(1) returns 1 (only j=0 is <=1). So inversion_count += 2 -1=1. inversion_count becomes1 (previous from 'z') +1=2.

Then, add j=1. current_size becomes3.

Fourth 'a' in target: select j=2.

current_size is3. query(2) returns the sum of elements <=2. j=0,1, and2 (but 2 has not been added yet). The Fenwick Tree contains j=0,3,1. So query(2) returns 0+1+0=1 (sum of j=0 and j=1, which are <=2).

inversion_count +=3 -1=2. Total becomes2+2=4.

But sample's answer is2. So this is incorrect.

So what's wrong here?

Ah, no. The sample's answer is2, but according to this approach, the inversion count is2 after processing the third character (j=1), and then becomes4 after processing the fourth and fifth.

So this approach is not working.

But this contradicts the earlier analysis. What's wrong?

I think I've made a mistake in the selection of the indices for the target's 'a's.

Let's re-examine the first sample's processing steps:

target is 'a','z','a','a','a'.

Processing:

1. First 'a' → j=0. current_size=0. inversion_count +=0-0=0. Fenwick has 0. current_size becomes1.

2. 'z' → j=3. current_size=1. inversion_count +=1-0=1. Fenwick has 0,3. current_size 2.

3. 'a' → j=1. current_size=2. Fenwick.query(1) =1 (since j=0 is <=1). inversion_count +=2-1=1 → total 2. Fenwick has0,3,1. current_size3.

4. 'a' → j=2. current_size3. Fenwick.query(2) = sum of elements <=2. j=0 and1. So query returns2. inversion_count +=3-2=1 → total 3. Fenwick adds2. current_size4.

5. 'a' → j=4. current_size4. Fenwick.query(4) = sum of 0,1,2,3,4. Fenwick has0,1,2,3. So query returns4. inversion_count +=4-4=0. total remains3. Fenwick adds4. current_size5.

Total inversion_count is3. But sample's answer is2.

So why is this discrepancy?

Because the correct permutation for the sample requires two inversions, but the algorithm's approach gives3.

This suggests that the algorithm's approach is not correct.

But according to the sample's explanation, the swaps are between indices3 and4 (z and a), and between indices1 and2 (a and z).

The permutation that achieves this is:

Original indices:0,1,2,3,4 → target indices0,1,2,3,4 are4,3,2,1,0. But sample's explanation uses a different permutation.

Wait, the sample's explanation involves moving the 'z' from index3 to index1, which requires two swaps. The 'a' at index4 moves to index0, which requires four swaps, but the other 'a's move to their positions. So the total swaps is2.

But according to the algorithm's approach, the inversion count is3. So the algorithm is not capturing the correct permutation.

So what's the problem here?

Ah! The algorithm is not selecting the correct permutation. The algorithm's approach of selecting the leftmost occurrence of each character in the target may not lead to the minimal inversion count.

But why?

In the first sample, the algorithm selects j=0 for the first 'a', which is the leftmost 'a' in the original. But this 'a' needs to be moved to position0 in the target. However, in the original, this 'a' is already in position0. So no swaps are needed for it.

But moving 'z' to position1 requires moving it two positions to the left. This would require two swaps. The 'a's at indices1,2,4 are moved to positions3,2,0. Moving the 'a' at index4 to position0 would require four swaps, but in the sample's explanation, this 'a' is not moved. So there's a contradiction.

It seems that the algorithm is not handling the movement of 'a's correctly.

This indicates that the algorithm's approach is not the correct one for this problem. Therefore, the correct approach must be different.

Another idea: the problem is to reverse the string, so the required permutation is the one that maps each original index i to target index n-1 -i. For duplicate characters, the order in which they are mapped can be optimized.

The inversion count for this permutation is the number of swaps required. But when there are duplicates, the permutation may not be unique, and the minimal inversion count is the minimal number among all possible permutations that form the reversed string.

But how to compute this.

The correct approach is to assign the original's characters to the target's positions in a way that the relative order of the original's characters is preserved as much as possible, thus minimizing the inversion count. This is achieved by processing the target from right to left and selecting the rightmost occurrence of each character in the original.

Wait, this is the initial approach, but that didn't work for the first sample. Let's try it again.

Processing target from right to left:

Sample1:

target is 'azaaa' → processing from right to left:

 position4: 'a' → select rightmost 'a' in original (index4). Inversion count +=0. Add4.

position3: 'a' → select rightmost remaining 'a' (index2). inversion count +=number of elements already processed (4) and less than2 → elements less than2: none. So 0.

position2: 'a' → select index1. elements already processed:4,2. less than1: none. inversion_count +=0.

position1: 'z' → select index3. elements already processed:4,2,1. less than3:4 is not less than3. 2 and1 are less than3. So count is2. inversion_count +=2.

position0: 'a' → select index0. elements processed:4,2,1,3. less than0: none. inversion_count remains2.

Total inversion_count is2, which matches the sample's answer.

So this approach is correct.

So the correct approach is to process the target from right to left and select the rightmost available occurrence of each character in the original. The number of inversions contributed by each selection is the number of elements already processed that are less than j.

So the algorithm is:

1. Preprocess the original string's characters into a dictionary of lists, with each list sorted in reverse order (so that we can pop from the end to get the rightmost occurrence).

2. Process the target string from right to left (i from n-1 downto 0). For each character c in the target:

   a. Select the rightmost occurrence of c in the original's list (pop from the end of the list).

   b. The number of inversions contributed is the number of elements already processed that are less than j.

   c. Add j to the Fenwick Tree.

The inversion count is the sum of all the contributions.

But why does this approach work?

Because by processing the target from right to left and selecting the rightmost occurrence, we ensure that the selected j is as large as possible, which minimizes the number of elements already processed (which are to the right of j in the original) that are less than j. Because when processing from right to left, the elements already processed are those that have been selected for positions to the right of the current position in the target. These elements must come from the original's indices that are to the right of j (since we are processing right to left and selecting the rightmost available indices first). Therefore, the number of elements already processed that are less than j is the number of elements to the left of j that have been processed, which would have to be swapped past j to reach their positions.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Let's re-analyze the first sample with this approach.

Sample1:

Original 'a's are at indices0,1,2,4. Sorted in reverse order: [4,2,1,0].

'z' is at3.

Processing target from right to left (positions4,3,2,1,0).

Target is 'a','z','a','a','a' → reversed is 'a','a','a','z','a'.

Processing from right to left:

Position4 (target's last character 'a') → select rightmost 'a' in original's list (4). Add to Fenwick Tree. Inversion count 0.

Position3 (target's fourth 'a') → select next rightmost 'a' (2). Inversion count is the number of elements already processed (4) and less than2 → 0. Add2.

Position2 (target's third 'a') → select next rightmost 'a' (1). Elements processed are4,2. Query Fenwick Tree for j=1 → number of elements less than1 →0. Add1. inversion_count 0.

Position1 (target's 'z') → select3. elements processed are4,2,1. Query for3: number of elements less than3 →4 is >3, 2,1 are <3. So count is2. inversion_count +=2. Total2.

Position0 (target's first 'a') → select0. elements processed are4,2,1,3. Query for0: number of elements less than0 is0. Add0. inversion_count remains2.

Total inversion_count is2, which matches the sample's answer.

Thus, this approach is correct.

So the correct algorithm is:

Process the target string from right to left.

For each character c in the target (processed right to left):

   select the rightmost occurrence of c in the original that hasn't been used yet.

   the number of inversions contributed is the number of elements already processed that are less than j.

   add j to the Fenwick Tree.

So the steps are:

1. For each character c in the original, create a list of indices sorted in descending order (reverse order).

2. Process the target string in reverse order (from last character to first).

3. For each character in the reversed target:

   a. Pop the last element from the list for c (which is the rightmost available index in the original).

   b. Query the Fenwick Tree for the number of elements already processed that are less than j. This is the same as querying the Fenwick Tree for j-1.

   c. Add this count to the inversion count.

   d. Update the Fenwick Tree to include j.

This way, each selected j contributes inversions equal to the number of elements already processed that are to the left of j in the original. These elements are already processed (selected for positions to the right in the target), and thus must be swapped past j to reach their positions, leading to inversions.

Implementing this approach.

So the code should:

- Preprocess the original string's indices for each character in descending order.

- Process the target in reverse order (from the last character to the first).

For example, the target is s_reversed = s[::-1]. Processing in reverse order means iterating from the end of s_reversed to the beginning. So for s_reversed[i], i goes from n-1 downto0.

But wait, the target is s_reversed. To process from right to left in the target, we need to iterate over s_reversed in reverse order. So for example, for s_reversed = 'azaaa' (sample1), processing from right to left would be 'a','a','a','z','a'.

Wait, no. Processing the target from right to left means processing the characters in the order of target's indices from n-1 downto0.

So for sample1's target 'azaaa', processing from right to left would be:

i=4: 'a', i=3: 'a', i=2: 'a', i=1: 'z', i=0: 'a'.

So the code should iterate over the target in reverse order.

So the code steps:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()
target = s[::-1]

# Preprocess the original's indices for each character in descending order.
char_indices = defaultdict(deque)
for i in reversed(range(n)):  # iterate from n-1 to0
    c = s[i]
    char_indices[c].append(i)

# Fenwick Tree to track processed indices.
fenwick = FenwickTree(n)
inversion_count =0

# Process the target in reverse order (from right to left)
for c in reversed(target):
    # Get the rightmost available index for c
    j = char_indices[c].popleft()
    # Query the number of elements already processed and less than j.
    # Which is query(j-1)
    inversion_count += fenwick.query(j-1)
    fenwick.update(j, 1)

print(inversion_count)

Now, the Fenwick Tree's query method returns the sum of elements <= j-1. Which is the number of elements already processed and less than j.

Let's test this code for sample1.

Sample1:

Original indices for 'a's are processed in reversed order:4,2,1,0. 'z' is3.

char_indices['a'] = deque([4,2,1,0]) (since the original is 'a','a','a','z','a' → when processed in reversed order (4,3,2,1,0), the 'a's are 4,2,1,0.

 target is 'azaaa' → s_reversed is 'azaaa'.

Processing the target in reverse order: iterate over 'azaaa' reversed → 'aaaza'.

Wait, no. The target is 'azaaa', and reversed(target) is 'aaaza'. So the code processes each character in reversed(target), which is the same as the original string.

Wait, no. reversed(target) is a generator that yields characters in reverse order. For target 'azaaa' (indices0-4), reversed(target) is 'aaaz a'? No. target is 'a','z','a','a','a'. reversed(target) is 'a','a','a','z','a'.

So processing the characters in reversed(target) order: 'a','a','a','z','a'.

For each of these characters:

1. 'a' → select j from char_indices['a'] → deque has4,2,1,0. Pop left (4). query(j-1=3). Fenwick Tree is empty → 0. inversion_count +=0. Add4.

2. 'a' → select j=2. query(1). Fenwick has4 → no elements <=1. inversion_count +=0. Add2.

3. 'a' → select j=1. query(0). Fenwick has4,2 → query(0) is0. inversion_count +=0. Add1.

4. 'z' → select j=3. query(2). Fenwick has4,2,1. elements <=2 are 2 and1. sum is2. inversion_count +=2. Total2.

5. 'a' → select j=0. query(-1) → 0. inversion_count remains2. Add0.

Total inversion_count is2, which is correct.

Yes! This matches the sample's answer.

So this is the correct approach.

Thus, the final code should:

- Preprocess the original string's indices for each character, stored in reverse order (descending).

- Process the target string in reverse order (from last character to first).

- For each character in this order, select the rightmost available index in the original.

- Use a Fenwick Tree to track the processed indices and compute the number of elements less than the selected index j, which contributes to the inversion count.

The code will be:

Now, implementing this in Python.

But note that the original code's Fenwick Tree needs to handle queries for j-1. So when j=0, j-1 is -1, and the query returns zero.

Also, the Fenwick Tree's indices must be handled correctly. The indices in the original are 0-based.

The Fenwick Tree implementation:

class FenwickTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.tree = [0] * (self.size + 1)  # 1-based indexing

    def update(self, index, delta):
        index += 1  # convert to 1-based
        while index <= self.size:
            self.tree[index] += delta
            index += index & -index

    def query(self, index):
        # returns sum of elements <= index (0-based)
        index += 1  # convert to 1-based
        res = 0
        while index > 0:
            res += self.tree[index]
            index -= index & -index
        return res

Thus, the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    class FenwickTree:
        def __init__(self, size):
            self.size = size

        def update(self, index, delta):
            index += 1
            while index <= self.size:
                self.tree[index] += delta
                index += index & -index

        def query(self, index):
            res = 0
            index += 1
            while index >0:

                index -= index & -index
            return res

Sample3:

Input is 'icpcsguru' (n=9).

The code should compute 30. Assuming the code is correct.

Thus, this is the correct approach.
