Okay, let's see. So the problem is to convert a number from scientific notation to a decimal representation with minimal digits. Hmm. The input is a string like a.deb where a is a digit, d is some possibly long number (like up to 1e100 digits?), and then e followed by an exponent b. Oh right, the constraints say that d has no trailing zeros and a can't be zero if b is non-zero. Wait, no, the problem statement says that in the input, a and b have no leading zeros, d has no trailing zeros. Also, if a is zero, then b must be zero. So the input is properly formatted.

So the input is structured as A followed by .d, then e, then B. So the original number is A * 10^B plus the d part, which is d * 10^(-len(d)) * 10^B. Wait, no. Wait, the entire number is (A + d * 10^{-m}) ) * 10^B, where m is the number of digits in d. So for example, 8.549e2 is (8 + 549/10^3) ) * 10^2 = (8.549) * 10^2 = 854.9.

The output needs to be in the form of a decimal number with as few digits as possible. So the goal is to combine the exponent with the current decimal part to shift the decimal point appropriately.

Let's break it down. Let's say the input is A.dParteB. So the number is equal to (A + dPart * 10^{-k}) ) * 10^B, where k is the length of dPart. Then, this can be rewritten as A * 10^B + (dPart * 10^{-k}) * 10^B = A*10^B + dPart * 10^{B -k}.

So the overall number is (A followed by dPart) multiplied by 10^{B - len(dPart)}. Wait, no. Let's see: Suppose dPart is "549" (length 3), and B is 2. Then, 8.549e2 is 8.549 * 10^2 = 854.9. So the original structure is A is 8, d is 549, B is 2. So the number is (8 + 549/1000) ) * 100 = 8.549 * 100 = 854.9.

So the general approach is: Combine the exponent B with the decimal digits. The decimal part (after the dot) has len(d) digits, so when we multiply by 10^B, we are effectively shifting the decimal point B places to the right. So the combined effect is that the decimal part's digits (d) are shifted by B places. But since the original decimal part was after the dot, which is equivalent to being divided by 10^len(d), and then multiplied by 10^B, the total exponent is B - len(d).

So the number can be represented as A followed by d, then shifted by (B - len(d)) decimal places. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of the number as A followed by d. Then, the exponent B shifts the decimal point. Let me try to model this.

The original number is (A + d / 10^m) ) * 10^B, where m is the length of d. Let's say m is 3, B is 2. Then, that's (A + d / 1000) * 100. For example, A=8, d=549, B=2. Then 8.549 * 100 = 854.9.

So the way to think about this is that the decimal point in A.d is moved B places to the right, but also considering the existing digits in d. Alternatively, when you have A.d multiplied by 10^B, the resulting number is A * 10^B + d * 10^{B - m}, where m is the length of d.

So the number can be broken into two parts: the integer part contributed by A and the decimal part from d, scaled by the exponent.

So the problem reduces to combining A and d into a single number (A followed by d) and then shifting the decimal point (B - len(d)) times. Wait, that might not be exactly correct, but perhaps that's a way to model it.

For example:

Take the first example: 8.549e2. So A is 8, d is 549 (length 3), B is 2. The combined digits are 8549. Then, the exponent is B - len(d) = 2 - 3 = -1. So the number is 8549 * 10^-1 = 854.9. Which is correct.

Another example: input is 8.549e3. B is 3, len(d) is 3. So exponent is 3 -3=0. So 8549 * 10^0 = 8549, so the output is 8549.

So the approach is:

1. Combine A and d into a string (A followed by d). Let's call this the significant digits S. For example, A=8, d=549 gives S=8549.

2. The exponent is B. The original position of the decimal point in A.d is after the first digit (A). So in S, the decimal point is after the first digit. Then, when we multiply by 10^B, the decimal point moves B places to the right. So the new position of the decimal point is after the first digit + B positions. But wait, the original number is A.d * 10^B. The original decimal is after the A. So in A.d, the decimal is after 1 digit (A is 1 digit). Then, multiplying by 10^B shifts the decimal point B places to the right, so the new position is after 1 + B digits. However, the d part adds len(d) digits after the decimal. So when you combine the two, maybe the total number of digits after the decimal is len(d) - B. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the way to model this is:

The original number is A.d * 10^B. Let's write A.d as a number. For example, A is 8, d is 549. So A.d is 8.549. Multiplying by 10^B (say 2) gives 854.9, which is 8.549 * 100.

So the way to construct the result is to take the digits of A followed by d (so 8549) and then shift the decimal point (B - len(d)) times. Wait, in the first example, B is 2, len(d) is 3. So 2-3 = -1. So 8549 * 10^-1 is 854.9, which is correct.

So the formula is: the number is S (A followed by d) multiplied by 10^(B - len(d)).

Wait, but 8.549e3 is (8.549) * 10^3 = 8549. S is 8549, B is 3, len(d) is 3. So exponent is 3-3=0, 8549 * 10^0 = 8549. Correct.

Another example: input is 0.33e0. So A is 0, d is 33. B is 0. So S is 033 (A followed by d), but that's 033. But leading zeros are a problem. Wait, but according to the input constraints, A and B have no leading zeros. So in this case, A is 0, but d is 33. The number is 0.33 * 10^0 = 0.33. So S is 033, exponent B - len(d) = 0-2= -2. So 033 * 10^-2 is 0.33.

So the steps are:

- Combine A and d to form S. But A is a single digit (0-9), and d is a string (possibly empty? Well, the input is a string of form a.deb. So d can be 0, but the problem says that d has no trailing zeros. So the input could be, like, 3.0e5? But according to the problem statement, d has no trailing zeros. So in that case, d must be 0. So for example, 3.0e5 is allowed, but d is 0. So when A is 3, d is 0, len(d) is 1. So S is 30, exponent is B - len(d) =5-1=4. So 30 * 10^4 is 3*10^5? Wait, no. Wait, original number is 3.0 * 10^5 = 3 * 10^5 = 300000. But according to S and exponent, S is 30, exponent 4. 30 * 1e4 is 3e5. Yes.

So the approach seems to work.

So the steps to compute the number are:

1. Combine A and d into a string S. For example, A=8, d=549 → S=8549.

2. The exponent is (B - len(d)). So the number is S * 10^(exponent). But how to model this? Because exponent can be positive or negative.

But the problem is to represent the number in decimal form with minimal digits. So the key is to find where the decimal point is placed in S, then adjusted by the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model the number as S, and then move the decimal point (B + len(S) -1) times? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the number as S (digits) with the decimal point shifted by (B - len(d)).

Wait, S is the combination of A and d, so S has 1 (from A) + len(d) digits. Then, the original exponent is B. So when we multiply by 10^B, the decimal point is shifted right by B places. But the original number is (A + d * 10^{-m}) * 10^B, which equals S * 10^{B - m} where m is the length of d. Because S is A followed by d, which is equal to A*10^m + d. Then, when divided by 10^m (from the decimal part) and multiplied by 10^B, it's S * 10^{B -m}.

So the total is S * 10^{B - m}, where m is the length of d.

So, for example:

Input 8.549e2: S=8549 (A=8, d=549, m=3). B=2. So exponent is 2 -3 = -1. So 8549 * 10^-1 = 854.9.

Another example: input 0.33e0. S=033 (A=0, d=33, m=2). B=0. exponent 0-2= -2. 033 is 33, but leading zeros are a problem. Wait, but when we process S, perhaps leading zeros are allowed here? Because S is formed by combining A (which can be zero) and d (which can be 33). So S is 033. But 033 as a number is 33. Wait, but in this case, the exponent is -2. So 33 * 10^-2 is 0.33. But the leading zero in S is part of the digits, but in reality, A can be zero. So S is 0 followed by d. So if A is zero and d is 33, S is 033. So 033 is 33. But when multiplied by 10^-2, 33 * 0.01 is 0.33.

But how to model this? Because leading zeros in S would affect the number. Wait, no. Because S is the digits, so leading zeros would make the number smaller. But according to the input constraints, when A is zero, B is zero. So the case where A is zero is only possible when B is zero. So in that case, the exponent is B - m = 0 - m. So for example, input is 0.33e0: B is zero, m is 2. So exponent is -2. So S is 033 (0 followed by 33). But S is 033, which is 33. Then 33 * 1e-2 is 0.33.

But in that case, S can have leading zeros, but since A is zero, but d can be zero only if d is exactly 0 (since d has no trailing zeros). For example, input 0.0e0. So S is 00. Then exponent is 0 -1 = -1. So 00 *1e-1 is 0.0. Which would be output as 0.

But the output requires that for integers, we remove the decimal point. So how to handle that.

So the key steps are:

- Combine A and d into S. So S is a string formed by concatenating A and d. For example, A=8, d=549 → S='8549'.

- The exponent is B - len(d). So the total exponent is (B - len(d)).

So the number is S multiplied by 10^(B - len(d)).

So S is a string of digits (without decimal points), and the exponent is (B - len(d)).

Now, the problem is to represent this number in the required format, with minimal digits.

So the number can be written as S followed by the exponent (B - len(d)) zeros. But that's only if the exponent is positive. Wait, no. Because 10^exponent is the same as moving the decimal point.

So the actual value is S * 10^exponent. So for example, if exponent is positive, then it's adding exponent zeros to the right of S. If exponent is negative, then it's moving the decimal point left by exponent digits.

So the way to represent S * 10^exponent is as follows:

The number is the digits of S, with the decimal point placed in a certain position, determined by the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is the number of digits to shift the decimal point to the right. For example:

If S is 8549 and exponent is -1: 8549e-1 → 854.9.

If exponent is 3: 8549e3 → 8549000.

If exponent is 0: 8549.

But how to model this in code.

So the approach is to split S into two parts: the integer part and the fractional part, based on the exponent.

The exponent (let's call it E) is B - len(d). So E can be positive, zero, or negative.

If E is positive: then we need to append E zeros to the right of S, because multiplying by 10^E shifts the decimal point E steps to the right. So for example, S is '12', E=3 → 12000.

If E is negative: then we need to insert a decimal point such that there are |E| digits to the right of the decimal. For example, S is '1234', E=-2 → 12.34.

So the problem is to represent S followed by E zeros if E is positive, or insert a decimal point len(S) + E digits from the left if E is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model as follows:

The number is S followed by the decimal point at position len(S) + E. So:

If E is positive, then the decimal point is after len(S) + E digits. For example, S is 123, E=2: len(S) is 3, so 3+2=5. So the decimal point is after the 5th digit. Since S has only 3 digits, this means appending two zeros. So 123 becomes 12300.

If E is negative, len(S) + E could be positive or negative. For example:

S is 1234, E is -2. len(S) is 4. 4 + (-2) = 2. So the decimal point is after the second digit: 12.34.

If S is 12, E is -3. len(S) is 2. 2 + (-3) = -1. So the decimal point is before the first digit, adding leading zeros. So 12 becomes 0.012.

But S can't have leading zeros unless A is zero. Wait, S is formed by A (which is a single digit, possibly zero) followed by d (which may start with any digit except leading zeros if d is non-zero? Wait, no. d can have any digits, but the input says that d has no trailing zeros. For example, if d is '05', that's allowed? Or wait, the input constraints state that d has no trailing zeros. So d can be '05' only if it's zero, but that's impossible. Because if d is non-zero, it can't have trailing zeros. So in the input, d is such that there are no trailing zeros. So for example, d can be '0' (if the input is a.0eB), but in that case, the input must have a non-zero B only if a is non-zero.

So when combining A and d, S can have leading zeros only if A is zero, which is allowed.

But back to the problem: S is a string of digits. The decimal point needs to be placed len(S) + E digits from the left. Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let's think again.

The formula is S * 10^E.

So when E is positive, multiplying by 10^E appends E zeros.

When E is negative, it's equivalent to dividing by 10^|E|, which is moving the decimal point |E| steps to the left.

So S is the digits. For example:

Case 1: E = 3. S = '12' → 12 * 10^3 = 12000. So the decimal point is after the fifth digit (len(S) + E = 2 +3=5). But since S is '12', adding three zeros gives 12000.

Case 2: E = -2. S = '1234' → 1234 * 1e-2 = 12.34.

Case 3: E = -5. S = '1234' → 0.01234 (since 1234e-5 is 0.01234).

So the approach is:

- The number has the digits of S, followed by E zeros if E is positive.

- If E is negative, the decimal point is placed len(S) + E positions from the start. So if len(S) + E > 0, the decimal is placed between digits. If len(S) + E <=0, leading zeros are added before the decimal.

But how to model this in code.

An alternative approach is to construct the number as a string, considering the position of the decimal point.

Let's compute the position of the decimal point as follows:

The original number is S (digits) with a decimal point after the first digit (since A is a single digit and d is the decimal part). Then, multiplying by 10^B shifts the decimal point B places to the right. So for example:

Original S is '8.549' (but S is formed by A=8 and d=549, so S is 8549, and the decimal is after the first digit, 8.549). Then multiplying by 10^2 moves the decimal point two places to the right, making it 854.9.

So the original decimal position is 1 (after the first digit). Then, after multiplying by 10^B, the decimal position is 1 + B.

But in S, the digits are all the digits from A and d. So the length of S is 1 + len(d). Let's call that len_S.

So the decimal point is at position (1 + B) relative to the start of S. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial decimal point is after the first digit (A). Then, when you multiply by 10^B, the decimal point is moved B positions to the right. So the new decimal position is 1 + B.

For example, in the first example, A=8, d=549 (len(d)=3), B=2. So S is 8549. The initial decimal point is after 8 (position 1). After multiplying by 10^2, the decimal moves two positions to the right, so position 3. So the number is 854.9.

So the decimal point is at position (1 + B) in the S string.

But len(S) is 1 + len(d) (since A is 1 digit, and d is len(d) digits).

So in the first example, len(S) is 4 (8+549), B is 2. position is 1+2=3. So inserting decimal after the third digit: 854.9.

In the second example: B=3. position is 1+3=4. len(S) is 4. So decimal after position 4, which is the end. So 8549 → 8549.

In the third example: input is 0.33e0. So A=0, d=33. len(d)=2. B=0. position is 1+0=1. So inserting decimal after first digit: 0.33.

So the problem is to determine where the decimal point is placed in the S string.

Once that position is determined, we can split the digits into integer and fractional parts.

But how to handle leading and trailing zeros, and the required output format.

So the steps are:

1. Combine A and d into S (a string of digits).

2. Compute the decimal position as (1 + B). Because the initial decimal is after A (position 1), and multiplying by 10^B shifts it B places right.

Wait, but the initial decimal is after A, which is 1 digit. Then, when you multiply by 10^B, the decimal moves B places to the right. So the new decimal position is 1 + B.

So in S, which is A followed by d (length 1 + len(d)), the decimal is placed at position (1 + B).

But what if (1 + B) is greater than the length of S? For example, S is 8549 (len 4), B=3. decimal position is 4. So the decimal is after the fourth digit, which is the end. So the number is 8549, which is an integer.

If the decimal position is 0 or negative? For example, S is 0 (A=0, d=0), B=0. decimal position is 1. But if S is '0', then the decimal position is 1, but the length is 1, so decimal is after the 0. So the number is 0., which is 0. But according to the output format, if it's an integer, we output without decimal.

Wait, perhaps the decimal position can't be zero or negative. Because B is a non-negative integer (since the input constraints say B is non-negative), and A is a single digit. So 1 + B is always at least 1. So the decimal position is always at least 1.

Wait, in the third example: A=0, d=33, B=0. decimal position is 1. So in S (0 followed by 33), which is '033', the decimal is after position 1. So S becomes '0.33'.

But leading zeros in the integer part are not allowed. So the output is 0.33.

Another example: A=0, d=0, B=0. S is '00', decimal position 1. So the number is 0.0 → output as 0.

So the approach is:

- The decimal position is (1 + B) digits from the start of S.

But wait, the decimal is placed after (1 + B) digits. So for example, in S = '8549', decimal position is 3 (1+2), which is after the third digit → '854.9'.

So the plan is:

- Split S into two parts: the integer part (digits before the decimal) and the fractional part (digits after the decimal).

The integer part is S[0: (1+B)] if (1+B) <= len(S), otherwise S followed by (1+B - len(S)) zeros.

Wait, no. Because if the decimal position is beyond the length of S, then the fractional part is empty, and the integer part is S followed by (decimal_pos - len(S)) zeros. Because adding those zeros would make the decimal_pos at the end of the new string.

For example, S is '8549', len is 4. decimal_pos is 4 (from B=3). So the number is '8549' → integer part 8549, fractional part empty. So output as 8549.

If S is '12', decimal_pos is 5 (B=4). len(S) is 2. So the integer part is '12' followed by 5-2=3 zeros → 12000. So the number is 12000.

But this is not correct. Because the decimal is at position 5. So after the fifth digit. So S is '12', which is length 2. So 12 followed by three zeros: 12000. So decimal is after fifth digit (after 12000 → 12000.0?), but since the decimal is after the fifth digit, it's an integer.

But according to the problem statement, the output should have no decimal point if it's an integer.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

If the decimal position is after all digits (i.e., decimal_pos = len(S)), then there's no fractional part, so it's an integer.

But in the case where decimal_pos exceeds len(S), that would require adding zeros. For example:

S is '12', decimal_pos is 5. So the digits are '12' followed by 3 zeros. The decimal is after the fifth digit. So the integer part is 12000, no fractional part. So output is 12000.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the number can be represented as:

- The integer part is the first (decimal_pos) digits of S, padded with zeros if necessary.

- The fractional part is the remaining digits of S after the decimal_pos, if any.

But if decimal_pos exceeds len(S), then the integer part is S followed by (decimal_pos - len(S)) zeros, and fractional part is empty.

If decimal_pos is less than len(S), then the integer part is S[0:decimal_pos], and the fractional part is S[decimal_pos:].

But leading zeros in the integer part are not allowed, except when the integer part is zero (e.g., 0.123).

So the steps are:

1. Form S = A + d.

2. Compute decimal_pos = 1 + B.

3. Split S into integer_part and fractional_part:

   a. If decimal_pos <= len(S):

      - integer_part = S[0:decimal_pos]

      - fractional_part = S[decimal_pos:]

   b. If decimal_pos > len(S):

      - integer_part = S + '0' * (decimal_pos - len(S))

      - fractional_part = ''

   c. If decimal_pos < 0: (But since B is non-negative, decimal_pos is 1 + B >=1, so this can't happen.)

4. Now, process integer_part and fractional_part to remove leading/trailing zeros as per the output rules.

So, the integer_part should have no leading zeros (unless it's a single zero and there is a fractional part). Wait, no. The output rules state that if x is an integer, output it without decimal. Otherwise, p is the integer part (no leading zeros), q is the fractional part (no trailing zeros).

So for example:

Case 1: integer_part is '854', fractional_part is '9'. → 854.9.

Case 2: integer_part is '8549', fractional_part is ''. → 8549.

Case 3: S is '033' (from A=0, d=33), decimal_pos is 1. So integer_part is '0', fractional_part is '33'. So output is 0.33.

Another example: S is '00' (A=0, d=0), decimal_pos is 1. So integer_part is '0', fractional_part is '0'. But the fractional part has a trailing zero, which should be removed. So fractional_part becomes '0' (but according to the problem statement, fractional_part cannot be empty and must have no trailing zeros). So output is 0.0 → but according to the output rules, if x is an integer, output without decimal. So in this case, the output is 0.

Wait, but how to determine if x is an integer. If the fractional_part is empty or consists of all zeros. But in the example where S is '00', decimal_pos is 1, the fractional_part is '0' (since S is '00', decimal_pos=1 → integer_part '0', fractional_part '0'). So the number is 0.0, which is an integer. So the output is 0.

So after splitting into integer_part and fractional_part, the fractional_part may have trailing zeros. Wait, but according to the input constraints, d has no trailing zeros. So in the input, d is such that there are no trailing zeros. But when we combine it with B, the fractional_part in the output may have trailing zeros, which need to be removed.

Wait, but in the case where S is '00', decimal_pos is 1, the fractional_part is '0'. So 0.0 → which is an integer. So output is 0.

So the steps to process integer_part and fractional_part:

- Strip trailing zeros from fractional_part. If after stripping, fractional_part is empty, then output as integer_part (if it's non-zero), or 0 if integer_part is all zeros.

- Strip leading zeros from integer_part. If integer_part is empty after stripping (which can only happen if the original integer_part was all zeros), set it to '0'.

But how to handle the cases:

For example:

integer_part is '000', fractional_part is '4500' → leading zeros in integer_part are stripped to '0', trailing zeros in fractional_part are stripped to '45'. So output is 0.45.

Another example: integer_part is '0000', fractional_part is '000' → stripped to integer '0' and fractional_part '', so output is 0.

But how to process leading zeros in the integer_part and trailing zeros in the fractional_part.

So, steps:

Process integer_part:

- Remove leading zeros. If all digits are zero, leave as '0'.

Process fractional_part:

- Remove trailing zeros. If all digits are zero, fractional_part becomes empty.

Then, if fractional_part is empty, output the integer_part (without decimal). If not, output integer_part + '.' + fractional_part.

But what if the integer_part is '0' and the fractional_part is non-empty? Like 0.33 → output as 0.33.

But if the integer_part is empty (after stripping leading zeros), which can't happen because leading zeros are stripped, and if all zeros, it's set to '0' → so integer_part is always at least '0'.

So the code steps would be:

1. Process the integer_part:

   a. Strip leading zeros. If the result is empty (only possible if integer_part was all zeros), set to '0'.

   b. So for example, integer_part '000' becomes '0'.

2. Process the fractional_part:

   a. Strip trailing zeros. If the result is empty, then no fractional part.

3. If fractional_part is empty after processing → output integer_part.

4. Else → output integer_part + '.' + fractional_part.

But there's a corner case when the integer_part is '0' and the fractional_part is processed to non-empty. For example, 0.33 → output is 0.33.

Another case: if after processing, the integer_part is '0' and fractional_part is '0' → but fractional_part can't be '0' after processing because trailing zeros are stripped, so in that case, fractional_part would be empty, so output is 0.

So let's test this logic with some examples:

Example 1: input 8.549e2 → S=8549, decimal_pos=3.

integer_part = S[:3] → '854', fractional_part = S[3:] → '9'.

Processing:

integer_part → '854' (no leading zeros).

fractional_part → '9' (no trailing zeros).

So output 854.9.

Example 2: input 8.549e3 → S=8549, decimal_pos=4 (1+3=4). len(S) is 4 → integer_part is '8549', fractional_part is ''.

Output 8549.

Example 3: input 0.33e0 → S=033, decimal_pos=1. integer_part '0', fractional_part '33'.

Processing integer_part → '0' (leading zeros stripped to '0').

fractional_part → '33' (no trailing zeros). Output 0.33.

Another example: input is 3.0e5 → S=30, decimal_pos=6 (1+5=6). len(S) is 2 → integer_part is 30 + 4 zeros → 300000. So integer_part '300000', fractional_part is empty → output 300000.

Another example: input is 0.0e0 → S=00, decimal_pos=1. integer_part '0', fractional_part '0'. Process fractional_part → strip trailing zeros, becomes empty. So output is 0.

Another case: input is 1.200e1 → but according to input constraints, d (200) cannot have trailing zeros. So this input is invalid. So the code doesn't have to handle that. So in the input, d is given with no trailing zeros.

So the code can safely process the fractional_part by stripping trailing zeros.

Another example: input is 2.000e0 → d is '000' which is allowed (but according to constraints, d can be zero but must have no trailing zeros. So the input can't have d as '000' unless it's exactly '0'. So in the input, d is '0' (so S is 20). Then, B is 0. decimal_pos=1. integer_part '2', fractional_part '0'. After processing fractional_part becomes empty. So output is 2.

But wait, the input for d can't be '000' because that has trailing zeros. So the input must have d as '0' if it's zero. So in that case, S is A followed by 0. So S is '20' when A is 2 and d is 0. B is zero. decimal_pos is 1. integer_part '2', fractional_part '0'. After processing fractional_part is empty. Output 2.

So code steps:

Now, the code needs to read the input, parse A, d, B.

First, parse the input string. The input is of the form a.deb, where a is a single digit (0-9), d is a string of digits (possibly empty?), e is the character, and b is an integer (possibly up to 100 digits).

Wait, no. The input is a string like 'a.deb', where a is a digit, d is a non-empty string (since the input is a.deb, so the . is present), but wait, the problem says that the input is a string of form a.deb. So the format is "a.d" followed by "e" and then "b".

Wait, the problem says the input is a single string of form a.deb. So the parts are a, d, and b. For example, the first input is 8.549e2 → a=8, d=549, b=2.

But the input can also be like 0.0e0 → a=0, d=0, b=0.

So to parse the input:

Split the string into three parts: a, d, and b.

The steps to parse are:

1. Split the input string into two parts using 'e' as the separator. The first part is the part before 'e', the second is the exponent B.

So for example, '8.549e2' → split into '8.549' and '2'.

Then, split the first part into a and d using '.' as the separator.

So '8.549' → a is '8', d is '549'.

But what if the first part is like '0.0' → a is '0', d is '0'.

So, code steps:

s = input().strip()

parts = s.split('e')

left_part = parts[0]

b_part = parts[1]

a, d_part = left_part.split('.')  # since the input is in the form a.deb, left_part must have a '.'.

Then, a is a single digit (0-9), d_part is a string (possibly empty?), but according to the constraints, d has no trailing zeros and can be zero. So d_part is non-empty.

So a is a string of one character (0-9), d_part is a string of digits with no trailing zeros, and B is a non-negative integer (given as a string, but can be up to 100 digits).

But B can be up to 100 digits, so we need to parse it as an integer. But in Python, converting a string to int is possible even for 100-digit numbers.

So:

a = a_str

d = d_part

B = int(b_part)

Then, S = a + d.

So len(d) = m. The exponent E = B - m.

So decimal_pos = 1 + B.

But how to compute decimal_pos correctly.

Wait, no. The decimal_pos is 1 + B. Because the initial decimal is after a (position 1), and multiplying by 10^B shifts it B places to the right.

But the original number is (a + d/(10^m)) * 10^B → which can be written as (a * 10^m + d) * 10^{B -m} → (a followed by d digits) multiplied by 10^{B -m} → which is S * 10^{B - m}.

But S has len(S) = 1 + m digits.

So the decimal_pos is 1 + B digits from the start.

Yes.

Now, we need to split S into integer_part and fractional_part based on decimal_pos.

So len_S = len(S) = 1 + len(d).

If decimal_pos (1 + B) <= len_S → integer_part is S[:decimal_pos], fractional_part is S[decimal_pos:].

Else → integer_part is S + '0'*(decimal_pos - len_S), fractional_part is empty.

So code steps:

S = a + d

decimal_pos = 1 + B

len_S = len(S)

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    integer_part_str = S[:decimal_pos]

    fractional_part_str = S[decimal_pos:]

else:

    integer_part_str = S + '0' * (decimal_pos - len_S)

    fractional_part_str = ''

But then, we need to process these parts.

Processing integer_part_str:

Strip leading zeros. If all zeros → becomes '0'.

Processing fractional_part_str:

Strip trailing zeros. If all zeros → becomes empty.

If fractional_part_str is empty after processing → output integer_part_str.

Else → output integer_part_str + '.' + fractional_part_str.

But there are some edge cases to consider:

Case 1: integer_part_str is '0' and fractional_part_str is '0' after processing. But in this case, fractional_part_str would be stripped to empty, so output is '0'.

Case 2: integer_part_str is empty → but after stripping leading zeros, it becomes '0'.

Case 3: S is '0' (a is 0, d is empty?), but according to the problem statement, the input is in the form a.deb, which means d is present. So d can't be empty. So S will be a followed by d.

So for example, if a is 0 and d is 0, S is '00'. decimal_pos is 1 (if B is 0). So integer_part_str is '0', fractional_part_str is '0'. Processing:

integer_part_str → '0' (no leading zeros).

fractional_part_str → '0' → stripped to empty. So output '0'.

Another example: S is '033' (a=0, d=33, B=0 → decimal_pos is 1). integer_part_str is '0', fractional_part_str is '33'. Processed fractional_part is '33', so output is '0.33'.

Another example: a=9, d=999, B=100. decimal_pos = 1 +100=101. len(S) is 4 (9 + 999 → len 4). So decimal_pos is 101, which is longer than len(S). So integer_part_str is '9999' + '0' * (101 -4) → 9999 followed by 97 zeros. So the output is 9999... (97 zeros), which is a very large integer. So the code must handle this without converting to integer (since for B=100, the output can be up to 10^100 digits, which is impossible to handle as an integer in Python, but since we can construct the string directly, this is manageable.

So the code must handle S and B up to len(d) = 1e100, which implies that S can be up to 1e100 +1 digits. But in Python, handling very long strings is possible, but we need to process them carefully.

But given the time constraints (1 second per test), even for very long strings (like 1e100 digits), the code must process them efficiently.

So the steps in code:

Read the input string.

Split into a, d, B.

Construct S = a + d.

Compute decimal_pos = 1 + B.

Split into integer_part_str and fractional_part_str.

Process integer_part_str:

if decimal_pos <= len(S):

    integer_part = S[:decimal_pos]

    fractional_part = S[decimal_pos:]

else:

    integer_part = S.ljust(decimal_pos, '0')  # pads with zeros to make it length decimal_pos

    fractional_part = ''

Then, process leading zeros in integer_part:

integer_part_stripped = integer_part.lstrip('0')

if not integer_part_stripped:

    integer_part_stripped = '0'

else:

    integer_part_stripped = integer_part_stripped

Process fractional_part:

fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part.rstrip('0')

if fractional_part_stripped:

    result = f"{integer_part_stripped}.{fractional_part_stripped}"

else:

    result = integer_part_stripped

But there's a corner case when integer_part_stripped is '0' and fractional_part_stripped is non-empty. For example, 0.123 → correct.

Another corner case: integer_part_stripped is '0' and fractional_part_stripped is '0' → but fractional_part_stripped would be empty, so result is '0'.

But according to the code, fractional_part_stripped is obtained by stripping trailing zeros. So if the original fractional_part is '0', stripping trailing zeros gives '', so result is '0'.

But what if the integer_part is empty after stripping leading zeros? For example, if the integer_part_str is '000', then integer_part_stripped becomes '0'.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

Another example: input is 0.0e0 → a=0, d=0, B=0. S is '00'. decimal_pos=1. So integer_part_str is '0', fractional_part_str is '0'. Processing:

integer_part_stripped is '0'.

fractional_part_stripped is ''. So output is '0'.

Another example: input is 0.123e5. a=0, d=123, B=5. So S is '0123', decimal_pos=6. len_S is 4. decimal_pos (6) > len_S. So integer_part_str is '0123' + '00' (since 6-4=2). So integer_part_str is '012300'. Processing:

integer_part_stripped is '12300' (after stripping leading zeros). fractional_part is empty. So output is 12300.

But wait, the original number is (0 + 123/1000) * 1e5 → 0.123 * 1e5 = 12300 → correct.

So code works.

Now, coding this in Python.

But what about the case when B is a very large number (like up to 1e100)? But in Python, converting B from string to integer is possible.

So the code steps:

Read the input string.

Split into left and right parts on 'e'.

left_part, b_part = s.split('e')

a, d_part = left_part.split('.')

Then, B is int(b_part).

S = a + d_part

decimal_pos = 1 + B

len_S = len(S)

Then, construct integer_part_str and fractional_part_str.

But when decimal_pos is very large (like 1e100), adding zeros would create a very long string. However, for Python, creating such a string may take time. But given the constraints, perhaps the problem allows this, since the time limit is 1 second.

But for len(S) up to 1e100 (since d can be up to 1e100 digits), and B up to 1e2 (since B is up to 100), decimal_pos can be up to 1+1e2 = 101. So len(S) can be up to 1e100 +1 digits, but adding zeros up to decimal_pos (101) is manageable, since 1e100 is impossible to handle. Wait, no. If d is 1e100 digits, then len(S) is 1e100 +1. Then, when B is 100, decimal_pos is 101. So len(S) is 1e100 +1, which is larger than 101 → no, because 1e100 is way larger than 101. So in that case, decimal_pos is 101, len(S) is 1e100 +1 → 101 is less than len(S). So the code would take S[:101], which is possible. But S is 1e100 +1 digits, which is impossible to handle in Python due to memory constraints. But according to the problem's memory constraints (256MB per test), it's impossible to store a string of 1e100 digits. So the problem must have some constraints on the input size.

Wait, the problem says that d can be up to 1e100 digits. So len(S) can be up to 1e100 +1, which is impossible to handle. So there's a mistake here. How can the code handle d up to 1e100 digits?

But in practice, the code must read the input as a string and process it as a string. But for very large d (like 1e100 digits), the code would take O(n) time and memory, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem's constraints are not as written, but perhaps there's a typo. But the user's problem statement says that d can be up to 1e100, so the code must handle that.

But in Python, even for 1e100 digits, the code would not be able to process it within the memory or time constraints. So perhaps the problem has a different approach.

Wait, but the problem may allow len(d) up to 1e100, which is impossible to handle directly. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that when decimal_pos is B +1, and len(S) is 1 + len(d).

But when len(d) is very large (like 1e100), and B is up to 100, then decimal_pos is 1 + B (up to 101). So len_S is 1e100 +1. So in this case, decimal_pos is 101, which is much smaller than len_S. So integer_part_str is S[:101], and fractional_part_str is S[101:].

But S has 1e100 +1 digits, so S[:101] is manageable (only 101 digits). S[101:] is 1e100 +1 - 101 digits → which is 1e100 digits. But stripping trailing zeros from this would require processing all those digits, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem requires that after S[101:], all digits are zero. But according to the input constraints, d has no trailing zeros. So S is a + d, where d has no trailing zeros. So if a is non-zero, then S is a followed by d. For example, a=8, d=549 → S=8549. But if a is 8 and d is a very long string (like 1e100 digits) with no trailing zeros, then S[101:] would be the digits after position 101. Which would have no trailing zeros (since d has no trailing zeros). So when processing fractional_part_str, which is S[101:], which is a very long string, but to strip trailing zeros, we need to find the first trailing zero and cut it. But if S[101:] has no trailing zeros, then fractional_part_stripped is the entire string. But this would require processing 1e100 digits, which is impossible.

So this suggests that the problem's test cases do not have such large d with len(d) up to 1e100. Or perhaps there's a smarter way.

But given the problem's constraints, the code must handle these cases.

So the code would have to process the fractional_part_str, which can be up to 1e100 digits. Stripping trailing zeros from such a long string would take O(n) time, which is impossible. So how to avoid this?

But in reality, the fractional_part_str is S[decimal_pos:], which is the part after the decimal_pos. But in the input, d has no trailing zeros. So d's last digit is non-zero. So S is a + d. Since d has no trailing zeros, the last digit of S is the last digit of d, which is non-zero. So the fractional_part_str, which is S[decimal_pos:], can end with a non-zero digit, but the digits after the decimal_pos may have trailing zeros.

Wait, no. For example, if a is 8, d is '123450', which is invalid input (d has trailing zero). So the input d is guaranteed to have no trailing zeros. So d's last digit is non-zero. So S is a + d. For example, a=8, d=12345 → S=812345. The last digit is 5, which is non-zero. So in the fractional_part_str (S[decimal_pos:]), if any, the last digit is non-zero. So when processing fractional_part_str, any trailing zeros would have been added by the code's processing. Wait, no. Let's see:

If decimal_pos is within len(S), then fractional_part_str is S[decimal_pos:], which is a substring of S. The last digit of S is the last digit of d, which is non-zero. So the fractional_part_str can end with any digit except zero, unless the entire S is followed by zeros added by the code.

Wait, no. For example, S is 812345 (a=8, d=12345, len(d) =5). Suppose B is 3. decimal_pos is 1+3=4. S[:4] is 8123, fractional_part_str is '45'. So the fractional part is '45' → no trailing zeros. So when processing, we strip trailing zeros (which there are none), so output is 8123.45.

Another example: S is 812340 (but d is 12340, which is invalid input because d has trailing zero). So input is invalid.

Thus, in all valid inputs, S ends with a non-zero digit (since d has no trailing zeros and a is a single digit). So in the fractional_part_str (S[decimal_pos:]), the last digit is non-zero. So when processing the fractional_part_str, which is part of S, there are no trailing zeros. So when we call rstrip('0'), it will not remove any digits, except possibly if some zeros are present in the middle. So for example, if S is 8120345 (d is 120345, which is allowed as long as the last digit is 5, which is non-zero). Then, fractional_part_str may be '0345', which has trailing zeros? No, because the last digit is 5. So in this case, '0345' has no trailing zeros. So after rstrip('0'), it's still '0345'.

So in the code, the fractional_part_str, which is part of S (if decimal_pos <= len_S), will have no trailing zeros. So when we call fractional_part_str.rstrip('0'), it will return the same string if the last character is non-zero. Only if there are trailing zeros in the fractional_part_str (which can only happen if decimal_pos > len_S, but then fractional_part_str is empty). Wait, no.

Wait, when decimal_pos <= len_S, fractional_part_str is S[decimal_pos:], which is a substring of S. Since S ends with a non-zero digit (because d has no trailing zeros), if decimal_pos is less than len_S, then the fractional_part_str ends with the same non-zero digit. So in that case, the fractional_part_str has no trailing zeros. So when processing, rstrip('0') would leave the string as is, unless there are some zeros in the middle. For example, if fractional_part_str is '045', then after rstrip('0'), it becomes '045' → no, wait, '045' → trailing '5' is not a zero. So rstrip('0') will remove any trailing zeros. So in '045', there are no trailing zeros → rstrip('0') gives '045'. So in this case, trailing zeros are only at the end of the fractional_part_str.

But in S, since the entire S ends with a non-zero digit, the fractional_part_str also ends with a non-zero digit. So when we call rstrip('0'), the fractional_part_str is not modified. So the code can safely call rstrip('0') and get the correct result.

But for cases where decimal_pos > len_S, the fractional_part_str is empty. So no problem.

Thus, the code can process the fractional_part_str as follows:

fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part.rstrip('0')

So in all valid cases, if decimal_pos <= len_S, the fractional_part_str ends with a non-zero digit, so no trailing zeros. So fractional_part_stripped is the same as fractional_part_str.

Thus, for cases where d is very long (like 1e100 digits), the code will have to process a fractional_part_str of length up to 1e100 digits. This is impossible, but according to the problem's input constraints, this is allowed. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but the user's statement says that.

But in Python, even if the code is given a string of 1e100 digits, it would not be able to process it due to memory constraints. So this suggests that the problem's actual test cases do not include such large inputs, or that there's a smarter way to handle it.

But according to the problem statement, the code must handle the input as per the given constraints.

So the code will be written as per the steps outlined, and in practice, it will work for the given examples and cases where d is up to a reasonable length.

But for len(d) up to 1e100, the code will not run due to memory constraints. However, the problem's memory limit is 256MB, which can't handle a 1e100-character string. So perhaps the problem's constraints are actually len(d) up to 1e2 or something. But the user's problem statement says d can be up to 1e100 digits.

But perhaps the code can be optimized to handle this.

Alternative approach:

The key observation is that in the fractional_part_str, after the decimal_pos, all the digits are part of d, which has no trailing zeros. So the fractional_part_str will have no trailing zeros. So we can avoid calling rstrip('0') on the fractional_part_str when decimal_pos <= len_S.

So the code can be optimized as follows:

If decimal_pos <= len_S:

    fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str

    # because the last digit is non-zero (as d has no trailing zeros), so no trailing zeros in fractional_part_str

    # but wait, what if the fractional_part_str has trailing zeros in the middle? For example, d is 450, which is invalid. So the input would not have such a case.

    # So in the valid input, fractional_part_str has no trailing zeros, so rstrip is not needed.

But wait, if decimal_pos is 3, and S is '8549', then fractional_part_str is '9' → no trailing zeros.

Another example: S is '123456', decimal_pos is 4. fractional_part_str is '56' → no trailing zeros.

Thus, for valid inputs, when decimal_pos <= len_S, the fractional_part_str has no trailing zeros. So we can skip the rstrip('0') step for that case.

But when decimal_pos > len_S, the fractional_part_str is empty. So the code can handle it.

So the code can be optimized:

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str.rstrip('0') if fractional_part_str else ''

else:

    fractional_part_stripped = ''

But wait, in the case of decimal_pos <= len_S, fractional_part_str is S[decimal_pos:], which is a substring of S. Since S ends with a non-zero digit (because d has no trailing zeros), if decimal_pos <= len_S, then fractional_part_str is either empty (if decimal_pos == len_S) or non-empty. If it's non-empty, then the last digit of fractional_part_str is the last digit of S, which is non-zero. So fractional_part_str.rstrip('0') is the same as fractional_part_str.

Thus, the code can skip the rstrip('0') step for fractional_part_str when decimal_pos <= len_S. But wait, if the fractional_part_str has zeros in the middle followed by non-zero digits, then trailing zeros are not present. For example, fractional_part_str is '045' → ends with '5', so no trailing zeros. So rstrip('0') is safe.

But the code can safely call rstrip('0') regardless. So for the general case, the code should proceed as before.

But for large fractional_part_str (like 1e100 digits), the rstrip('0') would take O(n) time. Which is impossible. So how to handle this?

The key insight is that in the valid input, the fractional_part_str (when decimal_pos <= len_S) has no trailing zeros. So the rstrip('0') is redundant and can be skipped. So the code can optimize by not calling rstrip('0') in this case.

Thus, the code can be modified as follows:

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str

else:

    fractional_part_stripped = ''

# Then, process fractional_part_stripped:

fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_stripped.rstrip('0')

But wait, even if decimal_pos <= len_S, we need to strip trailing zeros from fractional_part_str. But according to the input constraints, this is not possible.

Wait, for example:

S is '8123405', but d is '123405' → but according to input constraints, d can't have trailing zeros. So the input would have d as '123405' only if the last digit is 5, so no trailing zeros. So S's last digit is 5. So fractional_part_str is the substring of S after decimal_pos, which, if it's non-empty, ends with 5.

Thus, the fractional_part_str cannot have trailing zeros. So the rstrip('0') call is redundant and can be omitted.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Process fractional_part_str:

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str.rstrip('0') if fractional_part_str else ''

else:

    fractional_part_stripped = ''

But even better:

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str

else:

    fractional_part_stripped = ''

fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_stripped.rstrip('0')

But since in the valid input, fractional_part_str has no trailing zeros, the rstrip('0') does nothing. So the code can safely do this.

But what if the input is invalid, and the code is given a d with trailing zeros? But according to the problem statement, the input is valid. So the code can proceed.

Thus, the code can handle even very large fractional_part_str by simply calling rstrip('0'), which in valid cases, returns the same string.

But for cases where decimal_pos is very large and fractional_part_str is very long, this could be a problem. However, the problem's constraints are probably such that in practice, the test cases do not have such large inputs.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows.

Now, implementing all this in Python:

Read the input:

s = input().strip()

Split into left_part and b_part:

left, b_part = s.split('e')

a, d = left.split('.')  # a is a single character, d is a string of digits with no trailing zeros.

B = int(b_part)

S = a + d

decimal_pos = 1 + B

len_S = len(S)

Construct integer_part_str and fractional_part_str:

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    integer_part_str = S[:decimal_pos]

    fractional_part_str = S[decimal_pos:]

else:

    integer_part_str = S + '0' * (decimal_pos - len_S)

    fractional_part_str = ''

Process integer_part_str:

integer_part_stripped = integer_part_str.lstrip('0')

if not integer_part_stripped:

    integer_part_stripped = '0'

else:

    integer_part_stripped = integer_part_stripped

Process fractional_part_str:

fractional_part_stripped = fractional_part_str.rstrip('0')

if fractional_part_stripped:

    result = f"{integer_part_stripped}.{fractional_part_stripped}"

else:

    result = integer_part_stripped

Handle the case when integer_part_stripped is '0' and there is a fractional part:

For example, if the result is '0.123', it's correct.

Now, code:

s = input().strip()

left_part, b_part = s.split('e')

a_part, d_part = left_part.split('.')

B = int(b_part)

S = a_part + d_part

decimal_pos = 1 + B

len_S = len(S)

if decimal_pos <= len_S:

    integer_part_str = S[:decimal_pos]

    fractional_part_str = S[decimal_pos:]

else:

    integer_part_str = S + '0' * (decimal_pos - len_S)

Let's test this code with the examples.

Example 1: input 8.549e2 → a='8', d='549', B=2.

S = '8549', len_S=4. decimal_pos=3.

integer_part_str = '854', fractional_part_str='9'.

integer_stripped → '854' (no leading zeros).

fractional_stripped → '9' → not empty. Output '854.9'.

Example 2: input 8.549e3 → B=3. decimal_pos=4. len_S=4.

integer_part_str = '8549', fractional_part_str is ''. fractional_stripped is ''. Output '8549'.

Example 3: input 0.33e0 → a='0', d='33', B=0.

S = '033', len_S=3. decimal_pos=1.

integer_part_str = '0', fractional_part_str='33'.

integer_stripped → '0' (since leading zeros stripped, then becomes '0').

fractional_stripped → '33' → output '0.33'.

Another test case: input 3.0e5 → a='3', d='0', B=5. decimal_pos = 1+5=6. len_S=2 (3+0=30). decimal_pos 6 > 2. So integer_part_str = '30' + '0'*4 → '300000'. fractional_part_str is ''. Output '300000'.

Another test case: input 0.0e0 → a=0, d=0, B=0. S= '00', decimal_pos=1. integer_part_str = '0', fractional_part_str= '0'. fractional_stripped → '0' → stripped to empty. So output '0'.

Another test case: input 1.2e1 → a=1, d=2, B=1. S= '12', decimal_pos=2. integer_part_str = '12', fractional_part_str ''. Output '12'.

Another test case: input 1.2e0 → a=1, d=2, B=0. decimal_pos=1. integer_part_str = '1', fractional_part_str = '2'. Output '1.2'.

Another test case: input 1.200e0 → invalid, since d has trailing zeros. But according to input constraints, this can't happen.

Thus, the code should handle all valid cases.
</think>

```python
s = input().strip()
left, b = s.split('e')
a, d = left.split('.')
B = int(b)
S = a + d
decimal_pos = 1 + B
len_S = len(S)

if decimal_pos <= len_S:
    integer_part = S[:decimal_pos]
    fractional_part = S[decimal_pos:]
else:
    integer_part = S + '0' * (decimal_pos - len_S)
    fractional_part = ''

integer_stripped = integer_part.lstrip('0') or '0'
fractional_stripped = fractional_part.rstrip('0')

if fractional_stripped:
    print(f"{integer_stripped}.{fractional_stripped}")
else:
    print(integer_stripped)
