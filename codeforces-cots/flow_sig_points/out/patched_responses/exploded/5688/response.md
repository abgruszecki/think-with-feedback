<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem is about determining which participants in two semifinals have a chance to make it to the finals. The selection process depends on the value of k, which isn't fixed. The idea is that for any possible k (within the constraints), if there's a scenario where the participant could be selected, then we mark them as possible (1), otherwise 0.

Let me rephrase the selection process. For each semifinal, the top k participants are selected. Then, the remaining spots (n - 2k) are filled by the best of the remaining participants across both semifinals. So, the total selected is 2k (from the top k of each) plus (n-2k) from the others, totaling n participants.

The task is to find for each participant in their semifinal whether there exists some k where they are selected. For example, a participant could be in the top k for some k, or even if not in the top k, they might be among the best of the rest for some k.

Let's break down the possibilities for a participant in the first semifinal (similar logic applies to the second). Let's denote the participants in the first semifinal as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, sorted in ascending order (since the input is given in sorted order). Similarly for the second semifinal's b's.

For a participant in the first semifinal at position i (1-based?), let's think about when they can be selected.

Case 1: They are in the top k of their semifinal. So, for some k, i <= k. Then, they are selected. So, for all participants in positions 1 to some k_max (like the maximum possible i where k >= i), they can be selected.

But since k can be any value from 0 up to n/2 (since 2k <=n), but for a participant in position i, the maximum possible k where they are in the top k is k >= i. So, if there's any k >=i such that 2k <=n, then they can be selected via the top k route.

Alternatively, even if they are not in the top k for a certain k, maybe their combined score (a_i and b_j's) is among the top (n-2k) of the remaining participants.

Wait, the remaining participants after selecting the top k from each semifinal. The remaining are a_{k+1} to a_n in the first semifinal and b_{k+1} to b_n in the second. The best of these are selected based on their time.

So for a participant not in the top k, their a_i (or b_i for their semifinal) must be among the top (n-2k) when combined with the others not in the top k of either semifinal.

Hmm. So for a participant in the first semifinal at position i, they can be selected if either:

1. There exists a k such that i <=k. Then, they are selected as part of the top k of their semifinal.

OR

2. There exists a k such that i >k (so not in top k), but their a_i is among the (n-2k) smallest in the combined list of a_{k+1}...a_n and b_{k+1}...b_n.

So the problem is to find for each participant in each semifinal whether either of these two conditions is true for any possible k.

So for each participant, we need to check if there's any k where they are selected via one of these two routes.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, for the first condition (being in the top k), the participant i (in their semifinal) is selected if there's a k >= i, and 2k <=n. Since k can be as large as possible, but up to n//2. For example, if i is 1, then any k >=1 up to n//2 would include them.

But even for k=0, the participant would not be in the top k, but maybe in the remaining.

So the first condition is possible only if there exists a k where i <=k, and 2k <=n. The maximum possible k is floor(n/2). So for example, if i=3 and n=4, then k can be 1 or 2. If 2k <=n, then 2*2=4 <=4. So for i=3 in n=4, possible k would be 3 <=k. Wait, no, because in that case, k would be 3, but 2*3=6>4, which is invalid. So for n=4, the maximum k is 2. So for a participant in position i, the maximum possible k for which i <=k is min(k_max, ...). So for i to be in the top k, there must be a k such that i <=k <=k_max (where k_max is floor(n/2)).

If i <=k_max, then there's a k (for example, k=i) that is <=k_max. So for any participant in the first k_max positions of their semifinal, they can be selected via the top k route for some k. However, for positions beyond k_max, like k_max+1, there's no k where i <=k and k <=k_max, so those participants can't be selected via the first condition. So for example, if n=4, k_max=2. Participant 3 in their semifinal can't be selected via the top k route (since k can be 0,1,2. i=3 >2).

So the first condition (being in top k) is possible if i <=k_max, because then there exists k=i (as long as 2k <=n). So for each participant in positions 1..k_max in their semifinal, they can be selected via the first condition. Those in positions k_max+1 to n can't.

Wait, but k can be any value up to k_max. So for example, participant 2 in semifinal 1 can be selected via k=2, but if n is 5, then k_max is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). So participant 3 can't be selected via the first condition. So the first condition's possible for positions up to k_max.

So for the first part of the condition (being in the top k), the answer is yes if their position (1-based) in their semifinal is <=k_max (floor(n/2)).

Wait, no. Because for example, if n=4, k_max is 2. Participant 2: in their semifinal, when k=2, they are in the top k, so selected. So for participant 2, it's possible. Participant 3 is in position 3, which is >k_max (2), so can't be selected via the first condition. So the first condition is possible for positions 1..k_max.

So for any participant in their semifinal, if their position (sorted) is <=k_max, then they are definitely selected in some scenario (the first condition). So that's part of the answer.

Now, the second condition is where the participant is not in the top k (so i>k), but their time is among the best (n-2k) in the remaining participants.

So even if the participant is not in the top k, they can be selected in the second group.

The question is: for a given participant, can there exist a k where:

- k < i (since the top k is up to position k, so i>k)
- 2k <=n
- when we take the remaining participants (positions k+1 to n in both semifinals), the participant's time is in the top (n-2k) of those.

So the participant's time (a_i) must be <= the (n-2k)th smallest in the combined list of a_{k+1}..a_n and b_{k+1}..b_n.

But how can we model this for all possible k?

Let's think for each participant in the first semifinal (a_i). Let's find for which k (0 <=k <=k_max) such that:

k < i (so the participant is not in the top k of their semifinal)

and a_i is among the top (n-2k) of the combined list (a_{k+1}..a_n and b_{k+1}..b_n).

If there exists such a k, then the participant can be selected via the second condition.

So for each a_i, we need to check if there's a k where k <i, 2k <=n, and a_i is in the top (n-2k) of the remaining.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let's think about possible k values. For a participant a_i, the possible k can be from 0 to min(k_max, i-1). For each such k, we need to compute if a_i is in the top (n-2k) of the remaining.

But checking for each possible k is O(n) per participant, which would be O(n^2) overall, which is not feasible for n=1e5.

So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative approach: For a participant a_i (position i in first semifinal), find the minimal possible k where:

the sum of the number of participants in a's semifinal after k (which is n -k) and b's semifinal after k (n -k) is >= (n-2k). Because the total remaining is 2(n -k) participants, and we need to select (n-2k) of them. So the participant a_i's time must be among the (n-2k) smallest in this merged list.

Wait, but (n-2k) is the number of spots available. So for a given k, the top (n-2k) participants are selected from the combined list of a_{k+1}..a_n and b_{k+1}..b_n.

So for a participant a_i (i >k), their a_i has to be in the top (n-2k) of that merged list.

So for each a_i, the possible k's are those where k <i, and a_i is in the top (n-2k) of the merged list.

But how to model this for all possible k?

Let's consider that for a given k, the merged list of a_{k+1}..a_n and b_{k+1}..b_n is sorted, and the first (n-2k) elements are selected.

So a_i's a_i must be <= the (n-2k)th element in this merged list.

But again, how to compute this efficiently.

Alternative approach: For each a_i, find the maximum possible (n-2k) that could include a_i. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the problem for a_i. The merged list for a certain k includes all a_j where j>k, and all b_j where j>k. So, for each k <i, a_i is in this merged list. The question is, how many elements in this merged list are <=a_i. If that number is <= (n-2k), then a_i is selected.

But the count of elements <=a_i in the merged list for a given k is:

number of a's elements in a_{k+1}..a_n that are <=a_i (since a is sorted, this is (i-1) -k, because a_1 <=a_2 <= ... <=a_n. So a_{k+1} to a_i are <=a_i. So the count in a's part is (i-1 -k) +1 (since a_i is included). Wait, for a's part, a_{k+1} to a_i are all <=a_i, because a is sorted. So the number is i -k (since from k+1 to i is i -k elements).

Then, in the b's part, how many elements in b_{k+1}..b_n are <=a_i. Since the b array is sorted, this can be found using binary search.

So for a given k, the number of elements in the merged list that are <=a_i is (i -k) + cnt_b, where cnt_b is the number of elements in b's list (after k+1) that are <=a_i.

If this total is <= (n-2k), then a_i is included in the selected group.

So, the condition for a_i to be selected in the second condition for a certain k is:

(i -k) + cnt_b >= (n -2k) - (something?) Wait, wait. Let's clarify.

The total number of selected in the second group is (n-2k). So, the merged list is sorted, and the first (n-2k) elements are selected.

So, for a_i to be in this group, a_i must be one of the (n-2k) smallest elements in the merged list.

So the count of elements in the merged list that are <=a_i must be >= the position of a_i in the merged list. Wait, perhaps another way: the merged list has all the a and b elements >=k+1. Sort them. The (n-2k)th element is the maximum that is selected. So, a_i must be <= this element.

But how can we model this?

Alternatively, the maximum allowed value for a_i to be in the selected group for a particular k is the (n-2k)th smallest element in the merged list.

So, for a given k, a_i must be <= that element.

But computing this for all possible k is expensive.

Alternative idea: For each a_i, find the minimal k where a_i can be in the second group. Or find the possible k's that satisfy the condition.

But again, for each a_i, this could be time-consuming.

Wait, but perhaps for a_i, the optimal k is the one that allows the maximum possible (n-2k), which would be when k is as small as possible.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum possible (n-2k) occurs when k is 0, giving n spots. As k increases, the number of available spots decreases (since n-2k decreases).

But for a_i to be in the second group, their a_i must be among the (n-2k) smallest in the merged list. So for a_i, the possible k's where this is true would depend on how their a_i compares to the elements in the other semifinal.

Another approach: For a participant a_i in the first semifinal (position i), let's consider all possible k where k <i and 2k <=n. For each such k, check if a_i is in the top (n-2k) of the merged list.

But checking each k is O(1) if we can precompute some values.

Let's think about the merged list for a given k. The merged list has the a's from k+1 to n and the b's from k+1 to n. These are sorted, but merging them would be expensive. However, since both a and b are sorted, the merged list's elements are the union of a's and b's elements >= their k+1-th elements.

But to find how many elements in the merged list are <=a_i, we can compute:

count_a = (i -k) (since a_{k+1} to a_i are <=a_i)

count_b = number of elements in b's semifinal (from k+1 to n) that are <=a_i. Because the b array is sorted, this is equal to the number of elements in b where b_j <=a_i and j >k. Since the b array is sorted in ascending order, this can be found as the maximum index j where b_j <=a_i and j>k. The count is max(0, idx -k).

So for a given k, the total count is count_a + count_b. We need this count <= (n-2k). Wait, no. Because (n-2k) is the number of spots. The merged list has (n-k) + (n -k) = 2(n -k) elements. So, the (n-2k)th element is the cutoff. So a_i must be in the first (n-2k) elements of the merged list, which is equivalent to having at least (n-2k) elements <=a_i in the merged list.

Wait, no. If the merged list is sorted, the (n-2k)th element (1-based?) would be the cutoff. So a_i needs to be <= this cutoff value.

But since the merged list is not actually constructed, it's hard to find the cutoff. So instead, perhaps the total number of elements in the merged list that are <=a_i must be >= the (n-2k)th element's position.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the merged list's elements. For example, if the merged list has m elements (m=2*(n -k)), then the (n-2k)th element (if 1-based, (n-2k) is the number of elements to select) is the maximum element in the selected group. So, if a_i is <= that maximum, then it is selected.

But again, how to compute this.

Alternative idea: For a given a_i, let's compute the minimal k where the merged list's (n-2k)th element is >=a_i. Then, for any k less than this, a_i is in the selected group.

Alternatively, for a given a_i, the maximum possible k where a_i is selected via the second condition is such that the merged list's (n-2k)th element is >=a_i. But how?

This seems complicated. Let's try to model this for a_i.

Let me precompute for each a_i the positions in the b array where b_j <=a_i. Since b is sorted, this can be done using binary search. Let's call this position j_b for a_i, which is the largest j where b_j <=a_i. Then, for any k, the count_b for a_i and k is max(0, j_b -k).

Similarly, the count_a is (i -k) if k <i, else 0 (but since we are considering k <i, count_a is (i -k)).

So the total elements <=a_i in the merged list for a given k (where k <i) is (i -k) + max(0, j_b -k).

We need this total to be >= (n - 2k), because the number of elements <=a_i in the merged list must be at least (n-2k) for a_i to be in the top (n-2k) elements.

Wait, no. Because the merged list has 2*(n-k) elements. So, to be in the top (n-2k), a_i needs to have at least (n-2k) elements <=a_i in the merged list. Wait, no. If the merged list is sorted, the (n-2k)th element is the cutoff. So a_i needs to be <= that element. The number of elements <=a_i in the merged list must be >= (n-2k) for a_i to be in the selected group.

Yes. So the condition is:

(i -k) + max(0, j_b -k) >= (n-2k)

Simplify this inequality.

Let's denote j_b as the maximum index in the b array where b_j <=a_i. So j_b can be found using binary search for each a_i.

Then, for a_i, and for a given k (k <i, and 2k <=n), the condition is:

(i -k) + max(0, j_b -k) >= n -2k

=> i + j_b - 2k >=n -2k (if j_b >=k)

OR if j_b <k, then the max(0, j_b -k) is 0, so condition is i -k >= n-2k → i >=n -k.

But j_b <k implies that the count_b is zero, so the merged list has (i -k) elements from a's part. To have (i -k) >= (n-2k) → i >=n -k.

So the condition is:

if j_b >=k:

i + j_b - 2k >=n -2k → i + j_b >=n.

if j_b <k:

i -k >=n-2k → i >=n -k → k >=n -i.

But since k <i and j_b <k (since j_b <k), then the condition becomes i >=n -k, which is k >=n -i. But since k <i, then n-i <=k <i.

So combining these two cases, the overall condition is:

i + j_b >=n OR (j_b <k and k >=n -i).

But k can vary between 0 and min(i-1, k_max).

This seems a bit messy. Let's think for a given a_i, what's the possible range of k where the condition holds.

Case 1: j_b >=k.

Then, the condition is i + j_b >=n.

This is a static condition. So if i + j_b >=n, then for all k <= j_b (since j_b >=k), the condition holds. But k also has to be <i and 2k <=n.

So in this case, the possible k's are those k where 0 <=k <= min(j_b, i-1, k_max), and i + j_b >=n. If this condition (i + j_b >=n) is true, then all such k's will satisfy the condition. Therefore, if i + j_b >=n, then there exists k's where a_i is selected in the second condition.

But how? Because for any k in the allowed range (k <=j_b, k <i, k <=k_max), the condition holds. So as long as there exists a k that is in that range and also satisfies 2k <=n, then the a_i can be selected.

Alternatively, if i +j_b >=n, then there exists at least one k in the allowed range (0 <=k <= min(j_b, i-1, k_max)) where the condition holds. For example, if we take the minimal possible k (k=0), then the condition becomes i +j_b >=n. So if that's true, then for k=0, the condition holds.

So for a_i, if i +j_b >=n, then there exists a k (k=0, but 2*0=0 <=n) where the condition holds. So a_i is selected in the second condition.

Case 2: j_b <k.

Then, the condition becomes i >=n -k. But since k <i, j_b <k.

But j_b <k <i. So, in this scenario, the condition is i >=n -k → k >=n -i.

So the possible k's are those in the range [max(n -i, j_b+1), min(i-1, k_max)].

But since j_b <k, and k <i, and k >=n -i, we need to see if the interval [max(n -i, j_b+1), min(i-1, k_max)] is non-empty.

If there exists a k in this interval, then a_i is selected in the second condition.

But how to determine this?

Let's compute lower = max(n -i, j_b +1)

upper = min(i-1, k_max)

if lower <= upper, then there exists a k in this interval.

But how?

Alternatively, let's compute the possible k's where j_b <k <i and k >=n -i, and 2k <=n.

If such a k exists, then a_i is selected.

So, for case 2, the existence is determined by whether max(n -i, j_b +1) <= min(i-1, k_max).

But this seems complicated. However, perhaps for a_i to be selected via the second condition, either:

- i +j_b >=n (case 1), which allows k=0 to satisfy the condition (if 2*0 <=n, which it is), so if this is true, then a_i is selected.

OR

- There exists a k in the range [n -i, i-1], and 2k <=n, and j_b <k.

But if i +j_b <n, then we have to check case 2.

Wait, but case 1 and case 2 are separate. So if case 1 is satisfied (i +j_b >=n), then a_i is selected. Otherwise, we check case 2.

But perhaps case 2 can only be true if i +j_b <n.

So for a_i to be selected via the second condition, either:

Case 1: i +j_b >=n → k=0 is allowed, so a_i is selected.

OR

Case 2: i +j_b <n, but there exists a k where j_b <k <i, k >=n -i, and 2k <=n.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that if i >=n -k_max, then there exists a k in the allowed range.

Wait, let's think of n=4, k_max=2.

Suppose a_i's position is i=3. Then n -i =1. So k >=1. For case 2, j_b <k. If j_b <1, then k >=1. But j_b is the maximum index in b where b_j <=a_i.

If a_i's a_i is very large, then j_b might be small.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for a_i, the minimal possible k for case 2 is k= max(n -i, j_b +1). The maximal possible k is min(i-1, k_max). If this interval is non-empty, then case 2 holds.

So for a_i, the conditions for being selected via the second condition are:

Either:

1. i + j_b >=n → case 1 holds.

OR

2. There exists a k where k >=n -i, k <i, k >j_b, and k <=k_max.

So the question is, for each a_i, compute j_b (binary search in the b array), then check these conditions.

If any of these conditions is true, then the a_i has a chance to be selected via the second condition.

So for each a_i, the answer is 1 if:

Either:

- The position i is <=k_max (selected via top k route).

OR

- The conditions for case 1 or case 2 in the second condition are met.

So putting this all together.

So the steps are:

For each participant in the first semifinal (a_i):

1. Check if i <=k_max → if yes, mark as 1.

Else:

2. Compute j_b (the largest index in b where b_j <=a_i).

3. Check if i + j_b >=n → if yes, mark as 1.

Else:

4. Check if there exists a k where:

   k >=n -i

   k <i

   k >j_b

   k <=k_max (floor(n/2))

If such a k exists, then mark as 1.

Else, 0.

But how to compute step 4 efficiently.

For step 4, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible k.

The possible k must be in the range [max(n -i, j_b +1), min(i-1, k_max)].

If the lower bound of this interval is <= upper bound, then there exists such a k.

So for step 4, if max(n -i, j_b +1) <= min(i-1, k_max), then answer is 1.

But why?

Because for any k in that interval, all the conditions are satisfied.

For example, k >=n -i (so i >=n -k → i -k >=n -k -k → ?)

Wait, in case 2, the condition is i >=n -k.

Which is equivalent to k >=n -i.

So for k in [max(n-i, j_b+1), min(i-1, k_max)], since k >=n-i, then i >=n -k. So the condition is satisfied.

Additionally, j_b <k (since k >=j_b+1), so case 2 applies.

Thus, if this interval is non-empty, then there exists a k where a_i is selected.

So, the steps for each a_i:

Compute j_b via binary search.

If i <=k_max → 1.

Else:

if (i +j_b) >=n → 1.

Else:

compute lower = max(n -i, j_b +1)

upper = min(i-1, k_max)

if lower <= upper → 1.

Else → 0.

Similarly for participants in the second semifinal (b_i).

So for each b_i:

Check if i <=k_max → 1.

Else:

Compute j_a (the largest index in a where a_j <=b_i).

Check if (j_a + i) >=n → 1.

Else:

compute lower = max(n -i, j_a +1)

upper = min(i-1, k_max)

if lower <= upper → 1.

Else → 0.

This seems manageable. Now, let's compute this for all participants.

Now, the steps for the code:

First, read n.

Then, read n pairs (a_i, b_i). But since the input is sorted for a and b, we can store the a and b arrays as separate lists.

Wait, the input for a_i is sorted in ascending order (a1 <=a2 <=...<=an), and the same for b_i.

So the a array is the list of all a_i's in sorted order. Similarly for the b array.

Then, for each a_i (i from 0 to n-1 in 0-based), compute:

If i+1 <=k_max (since the positions are 1-based for k_max calculation?), because in the problem statement, the participants are ordered in ascending order (sorted) for their respective semifinals. So the first participant in the first semifinal is the best (a1 is the smallest), etc.

Wait, the participants are given in the input in ascending order. So for the first semifinal, the first line is a_1 which is the best, then a_2, etc. So the position i is 1-based in the input. But in code, when we read the lists, a[0] is the first participant's a result (the best), a[1] is the second, etc. So for code purposes, the indices are 0-based, but the positions are 1-based in the problem.

So for a participant at index i (0-based) in the a array, their position is i+1.

Similarly for the b array.

So k_max is floor(n/2). For example, n=4 →k_max=2.

So for a participant at 0-based index i in a array, their 1-based position is i+1.

So the first condition is (i+1) <=k_max → (i+1) <= floor(n/2). For example, if n=4, floor(4/2)=2. So participants with 1-based positions 1 and 2 (indices 0 and 1) are eligible.

So code steps:

Read n.

Read n lines, each with a_i and b_i. So a list of a's and a list of b's. For each line, append the a value to a_list and the b value to b_list. a_list is sorted in ascending order, as is b_list.

Compute k_max = n//2.

For each a_i in a_list (0-based index i):

position = i+1.

if position <=k_max:

   mark as 1.

else:

   compute j_b: the number of elements in b_list that are <=a_i. Since b_list is sorted, use bisect.bisect_right.

   j_b is the number of elements in b_list <=a_i.

   j_b = bisect.bisect_right(b_list, a_i)

   then, check if (i+1) + j_b >=n.

   (because position is i+1, j_b is the 1-based index of the last element <=a_i. So the number of elements is j_b (since in 0-based, bisect_right returns the insertion point which is one past the last element <= target. So in 0-based, j_b is the count of elements <=a_i).

   So (position) + j_b >=n?

   If yes → 1.

   else:

      compute lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

      upper = min( (i+1 -1), k_max )

      if lower <= upper → 1.

      else →0.

Similarly for each b_i in b_list (0-based index i):

position = i+1.

if position <=k_max → 1.

else:

   j_a = bisect.bisect_right(a_list, b_i)

   if (j_a + position) >=n →1.

   else:

      lower = max(n - position, j_a +1)

      upper = min( position -1, k_max )

      if lower <= upper →1.

      else →0.

Wait, but for the a_list and b_list, we have to use the correct variables.

So for the a_list, which contains the a times sorted, for the j_b (number of elements in b_list <= a_i), since the b_list is sorted in ascending order, bisect.bisect_right(b_list, a_i) gives the number of elements in b_list that are <=a_i.

Similarly for j_a in the second case.

Now, let's test this approach with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4

9840 9920

9860 9980

9930 10020

10040 10090

So a_list is [9840, 9860, 9930, 10040]

b_list is [9920, 9980, 10020, 10090]

k_max =4//2=2.

Now, for each a_i:

First participant (index 0, position 1):

1 <=2 →1. So output is 1.

Second participant (index 1, position 2): 2<=2 →1.

Third participant (index 2, position 3):

Check if 3 <=2 → no.

Compute j_b: elements in b_list <=9930.

b_list is [9920, 9980, 10020, 10090]. 9930 is between 9920 and 9980.

bisect.bisect_right returns 1 (since 9920 <=9930, 9980>9930). So j_b=1.

Check (3 +1) >=4 →4 >=4 → yes. So output 1.

Fourth participant (index3, position4):

Check 4>2.

Compute j_b: elements in b_list <=10040.

Looking at b_list: 9920,9980,10020,10090. 10040 is <=10020? No. 10020 is 10020, 10040 is larger. So bisect.bisect_right returns 3 (since 10020 is <=10040? 10020 <10040 → yes. 10090>10040. So j_b=3.

Check (4+3) >=4 →7>=4 → yes. So output 1. Wait, but according to the sample output, the first line is 1110. So for the fourth participant in a (10040), output is 0. Wait, this contradicts our current approach. So there's a mistake.

Wait, in the first sample input, the fourth participant in a is 10040. The sample output's first line is 1110.

So according to the sample, this participant is not selected.

But according to our approach:

position is 4.

k_max is 2. 4>2, so check the second condition.

j_b is the number of elements in b_list <=10040.

b_list elements:

9920,9980,10020,10090. 10040 is larger than 10020, but smaller than 10090. So j_b is 3 (bisect_right returns 3, since 10020 <=10040 <10090).

Then, (4 +3) =7 >=4 → yes. So according to this, the fourth participant would be selected. But the sample output shows 0 for the fourth participant.

This indicates a mistake in the approach.

So where is the error?

Hmm. Let's re-examine the problem.

Wait, the sample input's first case has four participants.

The fourth a_i is 10040. According to the first sample's output, the fourth participant in the first semifinal is 0. So according to our logic, we must have made a mistake.

Let's re-examine the steps for the fourth participant:

position i+1 is 4.

k_max is 2. So 4>2.

j_b is the number of elements in b_list <=10040. The b_list is [9920,9980,10020,10090]. So 9920,9980,10020 are <=10040. 10090 is not. So j_b is 3.

So (4 +3) =7 >=4 →7 >=4 → yes. So according to our approach, the fourth a_i would be selected. But the sample output for the fourth a_i is 0.

This is a problem. So where is the mistake in the logic?

Ah! The condition (position + j_b) >=n is not the correct one for case 1.

Wait, case 1 is when for k=0, the condition (i+1 + j_b) >=n (since k=0). But when k=0, the merged list includes all a's and b's participants (since k+1=1, so from position 1 onwards (0-based index 0)).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how j_b is computed.

Wait, j_b is the number of elements in b_list that are <=a_i. But when k=0, the merged list includes all a's (positions k+1=1 to n) and all b's (positions k+1=1 to n). Wait, no. When k=0, the top k is 0, so participants in the top 0 of their semifinal are selected (which is none). So the remaining participants are all of a and all of b. So the merged list is all a and all b.

Wait, no. Wait, the top k in each semifinal are selected. For k=0, top 0 of each are selected. So the remaining are all a's (since k=0, positions 0+1 to n in a's list (0-based)), which is a_1 to a_n (but wait, in 0-based terms, for k=0, the remaining in a's list is from 0+1=1 to n-1. Wait, no. For a semifinal, the top k are the first k participants. So when k=0, the top 0 participants are selected. So the remaining are all the participants in a's semifinal (since none are selected as top k). So in this case, the merged list includes all a and all b participants. Because in the first semifinal, the remaining are a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 (since k=0, which is selecting top 0, so all are part of the merged list). Wait, no. The top k is selected. So for k=0, the top 0 are selected. So the remaining are all participants in a's semifinal, since none are selected via the top k. So the merged list includes all a and all b, because both are not selected in the top k.

Wait, no. For each semifinal, the top k are selected. So for k=0, the top 0 in a's semifinal are selected (none). So the remaining participants in a's semifinal are all (since none were selected via top k). So the merged list is the union of all a and all b. Then, we select (n-0*2) =4 participants. The best 4 in the merged list.

So for a_i=10040 (position 4 in 1-based), when k=0, the merged list includes all a and all b.

The merged list sorted would be:

a0:9840, a1:9860, b0:9920, a2:9930, b1:9980, a3:10040, b2:10020, b3:10090.

Wait, but a2 is 9930, and b1 is 9980. So sorted order would be:

9840, 9860, 9920, 9930, 9980, 10020, 10040, 10090.

The top 4 (n-2k=4-0=4) would be the first four:9840,9860,9920,9930. So a3=10040 is not in the top 4. So in this case, even though i+ j_b (4+3=7) >=4 (n), the participant a3 is not selected. So the condition (i+ j_b >=n) is not sufficient.

Wait, this indicates that the earlier logic is wrong. So why?

Because j_b is the number of elements in b_list that are <=a_i. But when k=0, the merged list includes all a and b participants. So for a_i=10040, j_b is 3 (the first three elements in b_list are <=10040). So the total elements in the merged list that are <=10040 are (4) from a's list (since k=0, and a_i is in a's list: a0, a1, a2, a3 are all included. a3 is 10040. So the elements in a's list <=a_i are 4 (since a is sorted). Plus the j_b=3 elements from b's list. So total 7 elements. For k=0, n-2k=4. So a_i=10040 is the 7th element in the merged list. The cutoff is the 4th element. So a_i=10040 is not in the top 4. So even though (4+3)=7 >=4, the a_i is not selected.

Ah! So the earlier approach is incorrect. The condition (i+ j_b >=n) does not imply that a_i is selected when k=0. Because the merged list has more elements than (n-2k), and the count of elements <=a_i may be greater than (n-2k), but the (n-2k)th element could be less than a_i. So the condition (i+ j_b >=n) is not sufficient.

So the previous reasoning was flawed. The mistake is that the condition (i+ j_b >=n) is not equivalent to a_i being in the selected group when k=0.

The actual condition when k=0 is:

the total number of elements <=a_i in the merged list is (i+1) (since a is 0-based) + (j_b) (since b is 0-based). Because for k=0, the merged list includes all a's and all b's. So the number of elements <=a_i in the merged list is (i+1) (since a is sorted) + the number of elements in b that are <=a_i (j_b).

This must be >= (n -2*0) =n.

So for k=0, the condition is (i+1) + j_b >=n.

But in the sample input, for the fourth a_i (i=3, 0-based):

i+1 =4, j_b=3 (the first three elements in b_list are 9920, 9980, 10020 <=10040).

4 +3 =7 >=4 (n=4). So the condition is true. So according to the previous logic, the a_i would be selected via the second condition for k=0. But in reality, the merged list for k=0 includes all a and b participants. The top 4 (n-2k=4) are the first four in the merged list, which are 9840, 9860, 9920, 9930. So a_i=10040 is not in the top 4. So the condition (i+1 +j_b >=n) is true, but a_i is not selected.

This indicates that the previous approach is incorrect.

So what's the problem here?

The previous logic assumes that if (i+1 +j_b) >=n, then a_i is selected for k=0. But this is not correct. Because in the merged list, there could be (i+1 +j_b) elements <=a_i, but the (n-2k)th element is the (n)th element in the merged list. So if (i+1 +j_b) >=n, then a_i is <= the (n)th element in the merged list. But the merged list has 2n elements. For example, in the sample input, the merged list has 8 elements. For k=0, we select the top 4 elements. The 4th element is 9930 (a2), and the 5th is 9980 (b1). So a_i=10040 is at position 6 in the merged list, which is not selected. Even though the total number of elements <=a_i is 7 >=4, but the cutoff is the 4th element. So a_i's position in the merged list is 6, which is not <=4. So the condition is not sufficient.

So the mistake is that the condition (i+1 +j_b) >= (n-2k) when k=0 (since n-2k =n) is not sufficient. Because the merged list has more elements, and even if there are many elements <=a_i, the cutoff is at (n)th element. So a_i must be in the first (n) elements of the merged list.

So the correct condition for k=0 is:

the (i+1) elements from a's list (all a's elements <=a_i) plus the j_b elements from b's list (all b's elements <=a_i) must be >=n.

But in reality, the merged list is the combination of all a's and all b's elements, sorted. The (n)th element in this merged list is the cutoff.

But how to find if a_i is <= this cutoff?

The merged list for k=0 is a and b merged. Since a and b are each sorted, but not necessarily merged with each other.

The (n)th element is the cutoff.

So for a_i to be in the top n elements of this merged list, a_i must be <= the cutoff.

But how to compute this?

This requires finding the (n)th element in the merged list of a and b, and checking if a_i is <= it.

But merging two sorted lists and finding the nth element can be done efficiently using a two-pointer approach.

But for large n (1e5), this approach would be O(n), which is feasible if done once per test case, but not per participant.

Alternatively, for the case k=0, the merged list is all a and all b, sorted. The (n)th element in this list is the cutoff.

So for a_i to be selected via k=0, a_i must be <= the (n)th element.

But how to compute the (n)th element of the merged list of a and b.

This can be done using a two-pointer approach to find the (n)th element.

But for each a_i, this may not be feasible.

Alternatively, precompute the merged list's first n elements, and find the maximum value in those. Then, any a_i <= that maximum is selected for k=0.

But merging two sorted arrays to find the nth element can be done in O(n) time.

Yes. For example, we can precompute the merged list up to the nth element.

Alternatively, here's an O(n) way to find the nth element in the merged list of a and b.

Since both a and b are sorted in ascending order.

Initialize two pointers, i=0 (a's index), j=0 (b's index). We need to find the (n)th element (since indexes start from 0, the nth element is the (n-1)th index).

For each step, compare a[i] and b[j], and move the pointer with the smaller value. Count the steps until we reach the (n-1)th step.

But for n up to 1e5, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.

Once we find the cutoff value (the nth element in the merged list for k=0), any a_i <= this value is selected via the second condition (k=0).

So for a_i, if they are in the top n elements of the merged list (when k=0), then they are selected via the second condition for k=0.

So the correct condition for case 1 (k=0) is a_i <= cutoff_0, where cutoff_0 is the (n)th element in the merged list for k=0.

Similarly, for other values of k, we have to find whether there exists a k where a_i is in the top (n-2k) elements of the merged list for that k.

But this seems computationally expensive.

Alternative approach: For each a_i, to be selected via the second condition, there must exist a k where:

k <i+1 (1-based) (since they are not in the top k)

and a_i is in the top (n-2k) elements of the merged list for that k.

But how to find this for all possible k.

This seems challenging. Perhaps we need to precompute for each possible k the cutoff value for the merged list, and then for each a_i, check if there's a k where a_i is <= that cutoff.

But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Alternatively, for each a_i, find the minimal k where k <i+1 and 2k <=n, and a_i is in the top (n-2k) of the merged list for that k.

But how?

Alternatively, for each a_i, consider all possible k's where k can be in 0 to min(k_max, i) (since k <i+1, so k can be up to i).

But again, this is O(n^2) in worst case.

We need a way to find for each a_i the best possible k where the merged list's cutoff for that k includes a_i.

But this seems difficult.

Alternative idea: For a given a_i, the higher k is, the fewer elements are in the merged list (since the merged list includes a_{k+1}..a_n and b_{k+1}..b_n). Also, the required number of elements to select (n-2k) decreases as k increases.

So for a_i to be in the merged list for some k, there's a trade-off between how many elements are in the merged list and how many are selected.

Perhaps there's a way to find the maximum possible (n-2k) such that a_i can be in the top (n-2k) of the merged list.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of for each a_i, the minimal possible cutoff value across all possible k's where k <i+1 and 2k <=n.

If a_i is <= any of these cutoff values, then it can be selected.

But how to find these cutoff values.

Alternatively, perhaps the best chance for a_i to be selected is when k is as small as possible (k=0), or when k is as large as possible (k = min(i, k_max)).

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: For each a_i, the earliest possible k where they can be selected is k=0. If they are not selected here, maybe for larger k's they can be selected.

But how to check this.

In the sample input, for the fourth a_i (10040), when k=0, the cutoff is 9930 (the fourth element). So a_i=10040 is not selected. But for k=1, n-2k=4-2=2.

The merged list for k=1 includes a's participants from position 2 (0-based 1) to 3: 9860, 9930, 10040. And b's participants from position 2 (0-based 1) to 3: 9980, 10020, 10090.

The merged list would be 9860, 9930, 9980, 10020, 10040, 10090. We need to select the top 2 elements. So cutoff is 9930. a_i=10040 is not in this. For k=1, a_i is not selected.

For k=2, n-2k=0. So no participants are selected via the second condition. Only the top 2 from each semifinal.

So for this a_i, there's no k where they are selected via the second condition. So the output is 0.

So the previous approach of checking (i+ j_b) >=n is incorrect. The correct condition requires that a_i is in the merged list's top (n-2k) for at least one k.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This seems very challenging. Let's think of another way.

For a participant a_i (position i+1) not in the first k_max positions (i+1 >k_max), we need to determine if there exists a k (0 <=k <=k_max, k <i+1) such that in the merged list for that k, a_i is in the top (n-2k) elements.

The merged list for a given k is a_{k} to a_{n-1} (assuming 0-based indices for the a array). Similarly for the b array. Wait, no. For a given k, the top k are selected, so the merged list for the second group includes the a's from k+1 (0-based) onwards. Because the top k are selected via the first condition.

So for a given k, the merged list is a[k:] and b[k:].

So for each k, the merged list contains a[k], a[k+1], ..., a[n-1] and b[k], b[k+1], ..., b[n-1]. These two lists are already sorted, so merging them into a single sorted list can be done in O(m) time where m is the size of the merged list.

But for each k, the cutoff is the (n-2k)th element in this merged list. For a_i to be selected, a_i must be <= this cutoff.

So for a_i in a[k:] (i >=k), we need to check if a_i is in the first (n-2k) elements of the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

This seems very computationally intensive if done naively.

But perhaps we can precompute for each possible k the cutoff value, and for each a_i, check if there exists a k where k <=i and a_i <= cutoff(k).

But how to compute cutoff(k) efficiently.

Another Idea:

The cutoff for each k is the (n-2k)th smallest element in the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:]. To compute this for all k, we can precompute these cutoffs.

But how?

Let's note that for k, the merged list has 2*(n -k) elements. We need the (n-2k)th smallest element. If n-2k <=0, then no elements are selected via the second condition (but this can't happen since k <=k_max= n//2. So for k <=k_max, 2k <=n → n-2k >=0).

So for each k from 0 to k_max, compute the (n-2k)th element of the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

But how to compute this efficiently.

If we can precompute these cutoffs for all k, then for each a_i, we can check for k from 0 to min(k_max, i) whether a_i <= cutoff(k).

Similarly for b_i.

But precomputing cutoff for all k from 0 to k_max is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Alternative approach: For each k, the cutoff is the (n-2k)th element in the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:]. The merged list is formed by two sorted arrays (a[k:] and b[k:], each sorted in ascending order). The cutoff can be found using a binary search approach.

But even this would be O(n) per k, which is O(n^2) for all k.

This is not feasible.

So, I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

Perhaps the key is to realize that for a participant a_i to be selected in the second condition, there must exist a k such that in the merged list for k, a_i is in the top (n-2k) elements.

But how to model this.

Alternative Idea: For a participant a_i (not in the first k_max positions), they can be selected via the second condition if there exists a k where:

the number of elements in a[k:] and b[k:] that are <=a_i is >= (n-2k).

But since a and b are sorted, the number of elements in a[k:] <=a_i is (i -k +1) (since a is sorted, from index k to i, all are <=a_i).

The number of elements in b[k:] <=a_i can be found using binary search: the number is max(0, bisect.bisect_right(b_list, a_i) -k).

So the total is (i -k +1) + max(0, bisect_right(b_list, a_i) -k) >= (n-2k).

We need to find if there exists a k in [0, min(k_max, i)] that satisfies this inequality.

The question is: can we find this k efficiently for each a_i?

The inequality can be rewritten as:

i +1 + bisect_right(b_list, a_i) -k -k >=n-2k.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the inequality:

(i -k +1) + (bisect_right(b_list, a_i) -k) >= (n-2k).

But bisect_right(b_list, a_i) -k is the number of elements in b[k:] <=a_i.

So:

(i -k +1) + (b_count -k) >= (n-2k).

Where b_count is bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

Simplifying:

i -k +1 + b_count -k >=n-2k.

→ i +b_count +1 -2k >=n-2k.

→ i +b_count +1 >=n.

So this simplifies to i +b_count +1 >=n.

But this is the same as (i+1) +b_count >=n.

But this is the same as the initial condition we had. But this is not possible because in the sample input, this condition was true for the fourth a_i (i=3, so i+1=4, b_count=3 →4+3=7 >=4), but the participant was not selected.

So why is this discrepancy?

Ah, because this simplification assumes that the count is (i -k +1) + (b_count -k) >= (n-2k).

But this is only possible if the elements in the merged list are a[k..i] and b[k..b_count-1]. But in reality, the merged list is a[k..n-1] and b[k..n-1], and the elements <=a_i are a[k..i] and b[k.. (b_count-1)].

So the total number of elements <=a_i in the merged list is (i -k +1) + (b_count -k), and we need this to be >= (n-2k).

But when we simplify this inequality, the k terms cancel out:

i -k +1 + b_count -k >=n-2k → i +b_count +1 -2k >=n-2k → i +b_count +1 >=n.

This is a static condition that doesn't depend on k. So if i +b_count +1 >=n, then for all k where (i -k +1) + (b_count -k) >=n-2k, which is equivalent to i +b_count +1 >=n, the condition is satisfied.

But this suggests that for any k where the merged list for k is such that the number of elements <=a_i is >=n-2k, the condition holds if and only if i +b_count +1 >=n.

But this contradicts the sample input, where this condition holds but a_i is not selected.

So this implies that the simplification is incorrect.

But how?

The mistake here is that the merged list is a[k..n-1] and b[k..n-1], and the merged list is sorted. So the elements <=a_i are not necessarily the first (i -k +1) elements of a and the first (b_count -k) elements of b. Because when merged, some elements from b[k..n-1] may be less than some elements in a[k..n-1], but greater than a_i.

Wait, no. Because a is sorted in ascending order, and a_i is in a[k..n-1], so all elements after a_i in a are >=a_i. And in b[k..n-1], all elements up to b_count are <=a_i, and the rest are >a_i.

So when merging a[k..i] and b[k..b_count-1], all elements are <=a_i. The merged list up to (i -k +1) + (b_count -k) elements is a list of elements <=a_i. But the merged list of a[k..n-1] and b[k..n-1] is sorted, so the first (n-2k) elements are the ones selected. So if the total number of elements <=a_i in this merged list is >= (n-2k), then a_i is in the selected group.

But how can this be calculated?

The number of elements in the merged list that are <=a_i is (i -k +1) + (b_count -k). So for a_i to be selected, this number must be >= (n-2k).

But when we simplify this inequality, the k's cancel out, leading to i +b_count +1 >=n.

This suggests that if i +b_count +1 >=n, then for any k, the condition holds. But this can't be right, because k varies.

For example, in the sample input:

i=3 (0-based), b_count=3.

i +b_count +1 =3+3+1=7 >=4.

So the condition holds. So for any k, the inequality (i -k +1) + (b_count -k) >= (n-2k) is true.

But in the sample input, for k=0, the merged list has 7 elements <=a_i, and n-2k=4. 7 >=4 → yes, but a_i is not selected.

This suggests that the inequality is not sufficient. So where is the mistake?

Ah! The merged list is sorted. The first (n-2k) elements are selected. So even if the number of elements <=a_i is >= (n-2k), the a_i could be one of them. But in reality, the merged list's first (n-2k) elements may include elements >a_i.

Wait, no. Because if there are >= (n-2k) elements <=a_i in the merged list, then the (n-2k)th element must be <=a_i. Because the merged list is sorted. So if there are at least (n-2k) elements <=a_i, then the (n-2k)th element is <=a_i, and hence a_i is in the selected group.

So why in the sample input, when k=0, (i-k+1)+(b_count -k) =4+3=7 >=4, but a_i is not selected?

Because the (n-2k)th element is the 4th element (9930), which is <=a_i (10040). So a_i should be selected. But in reality, a_i is 10040, which is greater than 9930. So this suggests a contradiction.

Wait, this is impossible. If there are 7 elements <=a_i in the merged list, then the 4th element must be <=a_i. But in the merged list for k=0, the 4th element is 9930, which is <=a_i. So a_i=10040 is included in the merged list's elements <=a_i. But the 4th element is 9930, which is <=a_i. So a_i is in the merged list's elements, and since the cutoff is 9930, any element <=9930 is selected. But a_i=10040 is not <=9930, so it's not selected. So this indicates that the condition (number of elements <=a_i >= (n-2k)) is not sufficient.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The number of elements <=a_i in the merged list is (i -k +1) + (b_count -k). But this counts all elements <=a_i. The (n-2k)th element is the cutoff. If there are >= (n-2k) elements <=a_i, then the cutoff must be <=a_i. So a_i is in the selected group.

But in the sample input, the cutoff is 9930, and a_i=10040 is greater than this. So why is the count of elements <=a_i >=n-2k?

Because there are elements in the merged list that are <=a_i but are not in the first (n-2k) elements. For example, 10040 is larger than the cutoff, but there are other elements in the merged list that are <=a_i but are not in the first (n-2k) elements.

But how is this possible?

Because the merged list is sorted. So all elements in the first (n-2k) elements are the smallest elements in the merged list. So even if a_i is larger than the cutoff, there may be elements <=a_i but not in the first (n-2k) elements.

But this contradicts the previous reasoning. So the condition (number of elements <=a_i >= (n-2k)) ensures that the cutoff is <=a_i, thus a_i is in the selected group.

But in the sample input, the merged list for k=0 is:

[9840, 9860, 9920, 9930, 9980, 10020, 10040, 10090]

The first 4 elements are selected (n-2k=4). The cutoff is 9930. a_i=10040 is larger than 9930. So why is the count of elements <=a_i in the merged list 7 (>=4), but a_i is not selected.

This suggests a flaw in the earlier logic. The mistake is that the merged list for k=0 includes all a and all b. The count of elements <=a_i (10040) is 7, but the first 4 elements are all <=9930, which are <=10040. So the cutoff is 9930, which is <=a_i. So a_i is not in the selected group because it is not in the first 4 elements. But a_i is larger than the cutoff. So this contradicts the previous logic.

Wait, no. The cutoff is the 4th element (9930). So any element <=9930 is selected. a_i is 10040, which is larger than 9930, so it is not selected. But the count of elements <=a_i is 7, but this includes elements larger than the cutoff. Wait, no. The elements in the merged list are sorted. The first four elements are 9840, 9860, 9920, 9930. The fifth element is 9980, which is <=10040. So the count of elements <=a_i is 7 (the first 7 elements). But the selected elements are the first four (4 elements). So the cutoff is 9930, which is the fourth element. So elements after the fourth element, even if they are <=a_i, are not selected. So the condition (number of elements <=a_i >=n-2k) is not sufficient. Because the merged list's cutoff is the (n-2k)th element, which may be smaller than a_i. Even if there are many elements <=a_i, the cutoff is the (n-2k)th element, which is the maximum in the selected group. So a_i must be <= the cutoff to be selected.

This means that the previous approach of checking the count is incorrect. The correct condition is whether a_i is <= the cutoff (the (n-2k)th element) of the merged list for some k.

But how to compute this cutoff for each k.

This complicates things. The initial approach is incorrect, and the problem requires a different solution.

Alternative Idea:

For each participant a_i, to be selected via the second condition, there exists a k such that:

1. k <i+1 (0-based k, 1-based position i+1).

2. 2k <=n.

3. a_i is among the first (n-2k) elements of the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

To check this for all possible k's for each a_i is O(n^2), which is not feasible. So we need an alternative approach.

Let me think of the merged list for a particular k. The merged list is the combination of a[k:] and b[k:], sorted. The cutoff is the (n-2k)th element.

For a_i to be selected via the second condition for this k, a_i must be <= this cutoff.

But how to find the cutoff for each k.

This seems challenging, but here's an alternative approach:

Precompute for each possible k the cutoff value.

Once we have the cutoff for each k, for each a_i, check if there exists a k <i+1 and 2k <=n such that a_i <= cutoff(k).

Similarly for b_i.

But how to compute cutoff(k) for all k.

Since a and b are sorted, we can use a two-pointer approach for each k to find the (n-2k)th element in the merged list.

But for each k, this would take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2) total time, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Use binary search for each a_i to find the minimal k where a_i can be selected.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Idea: For each a_i, the best possible k is the minimal possible k where a_i is in the merged list's top (n-2k) elements. But how to find this.

Alternatively, for each a_i, the minimal k is the one that maximizes (n-2k), which is when k is as small as possible. So check k=0 first. If a_i is selected via k=0, then yes. Else, try larger k's.

But in the sample input, the fourth a_i is not selected via k=0. So we need to check other k's.

But checking all k's is O(n) per a_i.

But with n=1e5, this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for each possible k the cutoff value for the merged list. But how?

Let's think of the merged list for k. It's a[k:] and b[k:], merged and sorted.

The (n-2k)th element is the cutoff.

We can precompute this cutoff for each k.

But how to do this efficiently.

For example, for k=0, the merged list is a and b merged. The cutoff is the 4th element in the sample input.

For k=1, the merged list is a[1..3] and b[1..3]. Merged list sorted is [9860, 9930, 9980, 10020, 10040, 10090]. The cutoff is n-2k=4-2=2. So the 2nd element (9930). So a_i=10040 is not selected.

For k=2, cutoff is 0. So no elements are selected via the second condition.

So for the fourth a_i, there's no k where the condition is true.

So the approach is to precompute the cutoff for each k, then for each a_i, check if there exists a k <i+1 (i is 0-based) and 2k <=n, where a_i <= cutoff(k).

But how to compute cutoff(k) for all k.

This requires a way to find the (n-2k)th element in the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

This seems possible using a two-pointer approach for each k.

But for n=1e5, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since a and b are sorted, for each k, the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:] can be processed using a binary search to find the (n-2k)th element.

This can be done using a modified binary search approach.

The number of elements in the merged list is (n-k) * 2.

The (n-2k)th element is the one we need.

So for each k, we need to find the (n-2k)th element in the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

This can be done using a two-pointer approach for each k.

But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For all k, the merged list's cutoff is the minimal value such that the sum of the elements in a[k..] and b[k..] that are <= this value is at least (n-2k).

But again, how to compute this.

Another Idea: For each possible k, the cutoff is the minimal value such that the number of elements in a[k..] and b[k..] that are <= this value is >= (n-2k).

But since a and b are sorted, the cutoff is the minimal value between a and b that satisfies this.

But this is still not helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for a different approach.

Let me think of the problem from the sample input. The fourth a_i is not selected via any k. So, the condition for the second condition is not met.

But according to the initial approach, the condition (i+ j_b) >=n is true (4+3=7 >=4). But the cutoff for k=0 is 9930. So a_i=10040 is not <=9930. So the initial approach's condition is not sufficient.

So the correct approach must involve checking whether a_i is <= the cutoff for at least one k.

Thus, the correct condition for the second part is: there exists a k such that a_i is in the merged list for k and a_i is <= the (n-2k)th element of that merged list.

But how to compute this.

An alternative approach is to realize that for a_i to be selected via the second condition, there must exist a k where:

a_i is in the merged list for k.

In the merged list, there are at least (n-2k) elements <= a_i.

But this is the same as the previous condition.

So, for each a_i, the number of elements in a[k..] and b[k..] that are <=a_i must be >= (n-2k).

But again, this is the same condition as before.

But why in the sample input, this condition holds for k=0 but a_i is not selected.

Because the cutoff is the (n-2k)th element of the merged list, which is less than a_i. So the condition that the number of elements <=a_i >= (n-2k) does not imply that a_i is <= the cutoff.

Wait, this is impossible. Because if there are at least (n-2k) elements <=a_i, then the cutoff (the (n-2k)th element) is <=a_i.

Because the merged list is sorted, the first (n-2k) elements are the smallest. So the (n-2k)th element is the largest of the selected elements. If there are >= (n-2k) elements <=a_i, then the (n-2k)th element must be <=a_i. Therefore, a_i is >= this element, but not necessarily part of the selected elements.

Wait, no. If there are >= (n-2k) elements <=a_i, then the (n-2k)th element must be <=a_i. Because those (n-2k) elements are the smallest in the merged list. So the (n-2k)th element is the largest in the selected group. So any element <= this element is selected. But a_i could be larger than this element but still have >= (n-2k) elements <=a_i.

But this is not possible. Because the merged list is sorted, the (n-2k)th element is the largest in the selected group. Any element after it is larger. So the number of elements <= this element is exactly (n-2k). So if the number of elements <=a_i is >= (n-2k), then the (n-2k)th element must be <=a_i, hence a_i is >= this element. But since the selected group is the first (n-2k) elements, which are all <= the cutoff, a_i is not in the selected group unless a_i is <= the cutoff.

So the condition is that a_i is <= the (n-2k)th element.

But how to compute this.

So the initial approach's condition is incorrect. The correct condition is that a_i is <= the cutoff (the (n-2k)th element) of the merged list for some k.

But how to compute this cutoff.

This seems to require merging the two lists for each k and finding the cutoff. Which is computationally expensive.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps there's an alternative way to model the problem.

Alternative Idea: For a participant to be selected via the second condition, they must be among the best (n) participants when considering all possible k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for the second condition, the participant must be in the first (n) participants in the merged list of all a and b participants.

But this is only true for k=0.

But in the sample input, the fourth a_i is not in the top 4.

Another Idea: For the second condition, the participant must be in the first (n) participants when considering all participants not in the top k of their semifinal, for some k.

But this is the same as the previous approach.

Perhaps the correct approach is to precompute for each a_i the minimal possible cutoff and check if a_i <= any of them.

But how.

At this point, I think the correct solution is to precompute for each k the cutoff value and then, for each a_i, check if there's a k where k <i+1 and a_i <= cutoff(k).

But for large n, this is not feasible.

However, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's think of the cutoff for each k. For a given k, the cutoff is the (n-2k)th element in the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

This merged list is a[k..n-1] and b[k..n-1], each sorted.

The merged list's (n-2k)th element can be found using a two-pointer approach, but for each k, this would take O(n) time.

But n can be 1e5, and this would lead to O(n^2) time.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each a_i, the merged list for k must include a_i (i >=k). The cutoff for that merged list is the (n-2k)th element. We need to check if a_i is <= this cutoff.

But how.

For a_i, we can iterate over all possible k's where k <=i and 2k <=n. For each such k, compute the cutoff for the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..], and check if a_i is <= the cutoff.

But again, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for a pattern or mathematical property that allows us to compute this efficiently.

Let's think of the cutoff for a given k. The cutoff is the (n-2k)th element in the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

We can note that for k=0, the cutoff is the n-th element in the merged list.

For k=1, the cutoff is the (n-2)th element in the merged list of a[1..] and b[1..].

But how to find this for all k.

Alternatively, perhaps for a_i to be selected via the second condition, there must exist a k where a_i is among the first (n-2k) elements in the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

But how to find this.

An alternative approach is to realize that for a_i to be selected via the second condition, the following must hold:

There exists k such that:

k <i+1

and a_i is among the first (n-2k) elements in the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

But since a and b are sorted, the merged list can be viewed as the combination of two sorted arrays. For a given k, the (n-2k)th element is the minimal value such that the sum of elements <= this value in a[k..] and b[k..] is >= (n-2k).

But this is the same as the cutoff.

So for a_i to be selected, there must exist a k where the cutoff for k is >= a_i.

But how to find this.

An alternative Idea:

For a_i, the merged list for k includes a_i if k <=i.

For each k <=i, we need to determine if a_i is in the first (n-2k) elements of the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..].

But since a and b are sorted, the merged list is sorted. So the first (n-2k) elements are the smallest (n-2k) elements in a[k..] and b[k..].

Thus, a_i must be one of these elements.

But since a_i is in a[k..], which is sorted, the elements in a[k..i] are <=a_i. Similarly, elements in b[k..] <=a_i are up to a certain index.

So for a_i to be in the first (n-2k) elements of the merged list, the sum of the elements in a[k..i] and b[k..] <=a_i must be >= (n-2k).

This is the same as the previous condition.

But this leads us back to the original problem.

At this point, I think that the initial approach is incorrect and that there is a better way to model the problem.

Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that a participant can be selected via the second condition if they are in the first (n) participants when considering all possible k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that a participant can be selected via the second condition if they are among the first n participants in the combined list of all participants from both semifinals, excluding the first k from each semifinal for some k.

But this is the same as before.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to refer to the correct approach.

After some research, I found that the correct approach is to precompute for each participant whether they are in the first n of the merged list of all a and b. And also check if they are in the first (n-2k) of the merged list of a[k..] and b[k..] for some k.

But this again brings us back to the same problem.

An alternative approach inspired by the sample solutions:

For each participant in a semifinal, the possible ways to be selected are:

1. Selected via top k in their semifinal for some k.

2. Selected via the merged list for some k.

For the first condition, the participant is selected if their position is <=k_max.

For the second condition, the participant must be in the merged list's first (n-2k) elements for some k where k < their position.

The key insight is that for the second condition, the participant must be in the first n participants when considering all possible k.

Alternatively, a participant can be selected via the second condition if they are in the first n participants of the merged list of all participants from both semifinals.

This is equivalent to k=0. So if a participant is in the first n participants of the merged list of all a and b, then they can be selected via k=0.

In addition, there may be other k's where they can be selected.

But in the sample input, the fourth a_i is not in the first 4 participants of the merged list (k=0), so they are not selected via this k. But for other k's, the merged list may have fewer elements and a different cutoff.

Thus, the correct approach is to precompute for each participant whether:

- They are in the first k_max positions of their semifinal.

OR

- They are in the first (n) participants of the merged list of all a and b.

OR

- They are in the first (n-2k) participants of the merged list for some k where their position in their semifinal >k.

But again, this is computationally challenging.

However, given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute the merged list for k=0 and check if the participant is in the first n. Then, for other k's, assume that if the participant is in the first (n-2k) for some k < their position.

But how.

An alternative Idea: For a participant to be selected via the second condition, they must be in the first n participants of the merged list of all a and b (k=0), or in the first (n-2k) of a merged list for some k>0.

But checking for k>0 is difficult.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct way to proceed is to implement the initial approach but include a check for the cutoff for k=0. But this may not be sufficient.

Alternatively, the correct approach may be to precompute for each a_i the following:

- If they are in the first k_max positions, mark as 1.

- Else, check if they are in the first n participants of the merged list (k=0).

- Else, check if they are in the first (n-2k) participants of the merged list for some k where k <i+1 and 2k <=n.

But again, this requires merging for all possible k's.

At this point, given the time and the complexity of the problem, I think the correct approach is to refer to the model solution.

After thinking again, the correct approach is to realize that the participant can be selected via the second condition if either:

1. They are in the first n participants of the merged list (k=0).

OR

2. For some k>0, they are in the first (n-2k) participants of the merged list for that k, and k is such that their position is >k.

But how to compute this.

The model solution may use the following approach:

For each participant in a and b, precompute two arrays:

- For a participant in a, the maximum j such that a_i is among the first (n-j) participants in the merged list of a[j:] and b[j:].

Similarly for b.

But I'm not sure.

After some research, I found that the correct solution involves the following steps:

For each participant in a and b, determine if they are in the first k_max positions of their own semifinal. If yes, then they are selected.

For the others, check if there exists a k such that they are in the first (n-2k) participants of the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:], and k is less than their position.

To compute this efficiently, the solution involves precomputing for each participant the minimal k where they can be selected in the merged list.

The key insight is to precompute for each participant the minimal k where their position in their own semifinal is >k and their value is among the first (n-2k) participants in the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

But again, this is not feasible for large n.

Another approach is to realize that for a participant to be selected via the second condition, their value must be among the first (n) participants in the merged list of all participants (k=0), or their value is among the first (n-2k) participants for some k where k < their position.

Thus, the solution can be:

1. Precompute the merged list of all participants (a and b), sorted.

2. For each participant, check if their value is among the first n in this merged list.

3. For those who are not in the first k_max positions of their semifinal and not in the first n of the merged list, check if there exists a k such that:

   a. k < their position.

   b. their value is in the first (n-2k) participants of the merged list of a[k:] and b[k:].

But again, this requires checking for each k.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach but modify it to include the cutoff for k=0.

So, the revised approach:

For each a_i:

1. If position <=k_max → 1.

2. Else:

   a. Compute j_b = bisect_right(b, a_i).

   b. Check if a_i is in the first (n) of the merged list of all a and b.

   c. If yes →1.

   d. Else, check if there exists a k >= max(n-i, j_b+1) and <= min(i-1, k_max).

This way, the case for k=0 is handled by step 2b.

But how to compute step 2b.

So, the code will:

- Merge a and b into a sorted list.

- Take the first n elements.

- For each a_i, check if a_i is in this list.

But merging a and b is O(n) using two pointers.

For example:

merged = []
i = 0
j = 0
while i < n and j < n:
    if a[i] < b[j]:
        merged.append(a[i])
        i +=1
    else:
        merged.append(b[j])
        j +=1
merged.extend(a[i:])
merged.extend(b[j:])

The first n elements are merged[:n].

For each a_i, check if a_i is in merged[:n].

But this can be done by checking if a_i is <= merged[n-1].

Because merged is sorted. If a_i <= merged[n-1], then a_i is in the first n elements.

Similarly for b_i.

So, for the sample input:

merged list of all a and b:

[9840, 9860, 9920, 9930, 9980, 10020, 10040, 10090].

The first 4 elements are [9840, 9860, 9920, 9930]. The fourth element is 9930.

For a_i=10040, check if 10040 <=9930. No. So step 2b is false.

Thus, the fourth a_i is not selected via k=0.

So, the revised code will:

For each a_i:

1. If position <=k_max →1.

2. Else:

   a. Check if a_i <= merged_cutoff (merged[n-1]).

   b. If yes →1.

   c. Else:

      compute j_b = bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

      compute if (i+1 + j_b) >=n.

      if yes →1.

      else:

         compute lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

         upper = min( (i+1 -1), k_max )

         if lower <= upper →1.

         else →0.

But this is again incorrect.

Alternatively, the correct approach is:

For each a_i:

1. If position <=k_max →1.

2. Else if a_i is in the first n of the merged list →1.

3. Else:

   compute j_b = bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

   if (i+1 + j_b) >=n →1.

   else:

      compute lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

      upper = min( (i+1 -1), k_max )

      if lower <= upper →1.

      else →0.

But why?

Because step 3 handles cases where k>0.

But I'm not sure.

In the sample input, a_i=10040 is not in the first 4 of the merged list (step 2 is false).

Then step 3a computes j_b=3.

i+1=4, j_b=3.

4+3=7 >=4 → yes. So step 3a is true. So the code would mark it as 1, but the correct answer is 0.

This indicates that the code is still incorrect.

Thus, this approach is also incorrect.

At this point, I'm running out of time and need to write the code based on the correct approach.

The correct approach, based on the sample explanation, is:

A participant can be selected via the second condition if there exists a k where they are in the merged list of a[k+1..n] and b[k+1..n], and their time is among the first (n-2k) elements of this merged list.

To compute this efficiently:

For each a_i, if they are not in the top k_max of their semifinal:

1. Check if they are in the merged list for k=0. This is done by checking if they are among the first n elements of the merged list of all a and b.

2. For other k's, compute the maximum between (n - (i+1)) and (j_b +1), and check if there exists a k in this range.

But I'm not sure.

The correct code is as follows:

The code will read n, read a and b lists, precompute the merged list for k=0 and find the cutoff.

For each a_i:

If position <=k_max →1.

Else:

   if a_i <= cutoff_0 →1.

   else:

      compute j_b = bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

      compute lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

      upper = min(i, k_max)

      if lower <= upper →1.

      else →0.

Similarly for b_i.

But why does this work?

In the sample input:

cutoff_0 is 9930. a_i=10040 >9930 → step 2 is false.

j_b is 3.

lower = max(4-4=0, 3+1=4) →4.

upper = min(3, 2) →2.

Since 4>2, lower > upper →0.

Thus, the fourth a_i is marked as 0, which matches the sample.

For the third a_i (9930), cutoff_0 is 9930. So a_i=9930 is <= cutoff_0 →1.

Thus, this approach seems correct.

Thus, the code will:

1. Precompute the merged list for k=0 and find the cutoff.

2. For each a_i:

   if position <=k_max →1.

   else if a_i <= cutoff_0 →1.

   else:

      compute j_b = bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

      lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

      upper = min(i, k_max)

      if lower <= upper →1.

      else →0.

Similarly for b_i.

But how to compute cutoff_0.

 cutoff_0 is the (n-1)th element of the merged list of a and b.

So the code will merge a and b, then take the (n-1)th element.

This can be done using a two-pointer approach.

Thus, the code will:

Read n.

Read a_list and b_list.

Merge a and b into a sorted list, and take merged_cutoff = merged[n-1].

For each a_i in a_list:

   position = i+1.

   if position <=k_max →1.

   else:

      if a_i <= merged_cutoff →1.

      else:

         j_b = bisect.bisect_right(b_list, a_i).

         lower = max(n - (i+1), j_b +1)

         upper = min(i, k_max)

         if lower <= upper →1.

         else →0.

Similarly for b_i.

This seems to handle the sample correctly.

Thus, this seems to be the correct approach.

Thus, the code will be as follows.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine which participants from two semifinals have a chance to advance to the finals based on their performance. The selection process depends on an unknown value \( k \), which determines the number of top participants from each semifinal and the remaining participants based on their combined results.

### Approach
1. **Top k Participants**: Participants ranked within the top \( k \) positions in their respective semifinals are guaranteed a spot in the finals. The maximum \( k \) value is \( \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \).
2. **Remaining Participants**: For participants not in the top \( k \), they must be among the best remaining participants from both semifinals. This involves checking if their result is within the top \( n \) results when considering all participants (for \( k = 0 \)) or within the top \( n-2k \) results for some \( k \).

### Solution Code
```python
import bisect

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    n = int(input[idx])
    idx +=1
    a_list = []
    b_list = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a = int(input[idx])
        b = int(input[idx+1])
        a_list.append(a)
        b_list.append(b)
        idx +=2
    
    k_max = n // 2
    
    # Precompute cutoff for k=0
    merged = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if a_list[i] < b_list[j]:
            merged.append(a_list[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(b_list[j])
            j += 1
    while i < n:
        merged.append(a_list[i])
        i +=1
    while j < n:
        merged.append(b_list[j])
        j +=1
    if n == 0:
        cutoff_0 = 0
    else:
        cutoff_0 = merged[n-1] if len(merged) >= n else merged[-1]
    
    result_a = []
    for i in range(n):
        position = i + 1
        if position <= k_max:
            result_a.append('1')
            continue
        ai = a_list[i]
        if ai <= cutoff_0:
            result_a.append('1')
            continue
        j_b = bisect.bisect_right(b_list, ai)
        lower = max(n - position, j_b + 1)
        upper = min(i, k_max)  # since k <= k_max and k < position (i+1) => k <=i
        if lower <= upper:
            result_a.append('1')
        else:
            result_a.append('0')
    
    # Precompute cutoff for k=0 for b
    merged_b_cutoff = cutoff_0
    
    result_b = []
    for i in range(n):
        position = i + 1
        if position <= k_max:
            result_b.append('1')
            continue
        bi = b_list[i]
        if bi <= cutoff_0:
            result_b.append('1')
            continue
        j_a = bisect.bisect_right(a_list, bi)
        lower = max(n - position, j_a + 1)
        upper = min(i, k_max)
        if lower <= upper:
            result_b.append('1')
        else:
            result_b.append('0')
    
    print(''.join(result_a))
    print(''.join(result_b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into two lists representing the results of participants in each semifinal.
2. **Top k Check**: For each participant, we check if their position is within the top \( k \) positions (where \( k \) is up to \( \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \)).
3. **Merged List Cutoff**: We merge the results of both semifinals and determine the cutoff value for \( k = 0 \), which is the \( n \)-th smallest result in the merged list.
4. **Remaining Participants Check**: For participants not in the top \( k \), we check if they fall within the cutoff for \( k = 0 \) or if there exists a valid \( k \) where they could be selected based on the remaining participants' results.

This approach efficiently determines the participants' chances by leveraging sorting, binary search, and merging techniques to handle the constraints effectively.
