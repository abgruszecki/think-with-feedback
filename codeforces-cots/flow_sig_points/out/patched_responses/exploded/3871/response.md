Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the Grasshopper needs to jump on vowels in the string, and we need to find the minimal jump ability he needs so that he can reach the end. The jump ability is the maximum distance he can jump, and each jump has to be at least 1, up to that maximum. The key is to find the largest gap between consecutive vowels (including the starting position before the first character and the ending position after the last character), because that gap will determine the minimal required jump ability.

First, I need to parse the input string and identify all the positions of vowels. Then, I should include the starting point (position 0) and the end point (position len(s)+1) as part of the positions to check. Wait, no, the starting position is before the leftmost character (so position 0), and the ending is after the rightmost (so position len(s)+1). For example, the first sample input is "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". Let's see: the vowels here are A (positions 0?), wait, wait, no. Wait the string is zero-based or one-based? Wait, the problem statement says that the Grasshopper starts in front of the leftmost character. The characters of the string are in positions 1 to N, perhaps? Or maybe the initial position is 0, and each character is at positions 1, 2, ..., len(s). Then the end is at position len(s)+1. Or maybe the positions are considered as the indices of the string. Hmm, maybe the initial position is considered as 0 (before the first character), and each character is in positions 1 to len(s), and the end is at position len(s)+1. So the positions where the Grasshopper can land are the vowels in the string, plus the initial and end positions. Wait, no. The problem says that he can jump only on vowels. Wait, the problem says that the vowels are the positions he can land on, except the starting and ending positions. Wait, no. The problem states: he starts in front of the leftmost character (position 0), and wants to reach the position right after the rightmost (position n+1, where n is the length). But during his jumps, he can only land on vowels. So the initial position (0) and the final position (n+1) are not part of the string, but the vowels in the string are the positions where he can land. So the steps are:

- Start at position 0.
- Jump to a vowel in the string (positions 1 to n), each such vowel's position is a possible landing spot.
- Then, from there, jump to another vowel further ahead, until finally jumping from some vowel to the end position (n+1).

So the key is to compute the distances between consecutive vowels, including the start (0) and the end (n+1). The maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels (including start and end) will be the minimal required jump ability.

For example, in the first sample input: the vowels are at positions where the letters are A, B, A, B, B, A, C, F, E, Y, U, K, O, T, T. Wait, no. Let's look at the first example input: "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". Let's check each character:

Indices (assuming 0-based): 0:A, 1:B, 2:A, 3:B,4 B,5 B,6 A,7 C,8 F,9 E,10 Y,11 U,12 K,13 O,14 T,15 T.

So the vowels are at 0, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13. Then the positions are 0 (start), then the vowels in the string (indices+1?), wait wait, maybe the positions are 1-based. Let's clarify:

The string's characters are each at position 1 to n. The initial position is 0, and the end is n+1. So, for a string of length len(s), the end is at position len(s)+1.

So, each character in the string is at position i+1 where i is the 0-based index of the character in the string. For example, the first character is position 1, the second is 2, etc. So the initial position is 0, and the end is len(s)+1.

The Grasshopper can jump to vowels in the string (i.e., positions 1..n where the character is a vowel). So, the steps are:

Collect all the positions in the string that are vowels (their 1-based index).

Then, the list of positions to consider is [0] + [vowel positions] + [n+1], where n is the length of the input string.

Then, for each consecutive pair in this list, compute the difference. The maximum of these differences is the minimal required jump ability.

For example, in the first sample input:

The input is "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT", which has length 16. So the end position is 17.

The vowels in the string are at positions where the character is a vowel. Let's check each character (0-based indices):

Character 0: A → vowel → position 1.

Character 2: A → position 3.

Character 6: A → position 7.

Character 9: E → position 10.

Character 10: Y → position 11.

Character 11: U → position 12.

Character 13: O → position 14.

So the list of positions is [0, 1, 3,7,10,11,12,14,17].

Now, compute the differences between consecutive positions:

1-0=1

3-1=2

7-3=4

10-7=3

11-10=1

12-11=1

14-12=2

17-14=3.

The maximum is 4, which is the answer. So the minimal jump ability is 4.

Yes, that matches the first sample.

In the second sample input, "AAA", the string is length 3. So end is at 4.

The vowels are at positions 1,2,3.

The list is [0,1,2,3,4]. The differences are 1,1,1,1. Max is 1 → answer 1.

So the approach is:

1. Read the input string.

2. Find all the 1-based positions in the string where the character is a vowel (A,E,I,O,U,Y).

3. Prepend 0 (initial position) and append len(s)+1 (end position) to this list of positions.

4. Iterate through the list, compute the differences between consecutive positions.

5. The maximum difference is the answer.

If there are no vowels in the string, then the list would be [0, len(s)+1], and the difference is len(s)+1. So the answer would be len(s)+1.

But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the input string is non-empty, but there's no guarantee that it contains vowels. For example, input "BCD", then the Grasshopper must jump from 0 to 4 (since len(s)=3, end is 4), which is a distance of 4. So the answer is 4.

So, the steps are straightforward.

Now, to implement this.

In Python:

First, read the input string. Then, collect the 1-based indices where the character is a vowel. Then add 0 and len(s)+1 to the list, sort them (but adding 0 first and len(s)+1 last, and the vowels in order, so the list is already in order if we collect them in order). Wait, the vowels in the string are processed left to right, so their positions are 1-based and in order. So the list is:

[0] followed by [i+1 for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] is vowel], then len(s)+1.

Then, iterate through the list to compute consecutive differences.

So code steps:

s = input().strip()

vowel_positions = [0]

for i in range(len(s)):

    if s[i] in {'A','E','I','O','U','Y'}:

        vowel_positions.append(i+1)

vowel_positions.append(len(s)+1)

max_diff = 0

for i in range(1, len(vowel_positions)):

    diff = vowel_positions[i] - vowel_positions[i-1]

    if diff > max_diff:

        max_diff = diff

print(max_diff)

Yes. That's the code.

Testing the first example:

Input is ABABBBACFEYUKOTT (length 16). The vowels are at positions 0 (added), then 1,3,7,10,11,12,14 (from the vowels in the string), then 17. The differences are 1,2,4,3,1,1,2,3. Max is 4.

So code would output 4.

Second example: input "AAA" (length 3). vowel_positions is [0,1,2,3,4]. differences are 1,1,1,1. Max is 1.

Third example: input "BCD" (length 3). vowel_positions is [0,4]. difference is 4. Output 4.

So the code seems correct.

Now, handling edge cases. What if the string starts with a vowel? For example, input "A", then the code adds 0, 1 (vowel at position 1), then 2 (end). The differences are 1 and 1. Max is 1. Correct.

What if the string is empty? But according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty. So no problem.

So this code should handle all cases.

```python
s = input().strip()
n = len(s)
vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
positions = [0]
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] in vowels:
        positions.append(i + 1)
positions.append(n + 1)
max_jump = 0
for i in range(1, len(positions)):
    diff = positions[i] - positions[i-1]
    if diff > max_jump:
        max_jump = diff
print(max_jump)
