Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to compute the maximum possible beauty of an array after performing any number of improvement operations. The beauty is calculated by summing the f(s) for each element in the array. And f(s) is determined based on the minimal prime factors and whether they are good or bad.

First, let's unpack the definition of f(s). For a given s, we look at its minimal prime divisor p. If p is good (not in the bad primes set), then we add 1 to the result of f(s/p). Otherwise, we subtract 1. For s=1, it's 0.

So, the key is to process each element in the array and compute its contribution to the total beauty. But since we can perform operations that divide a prefix by their GCD, this changes the elements and thus their f values. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of such operations to maximize the sum.

Hmm. Let's think about how the operations affect the array. Each operation involves choosing a prefix (up to some r), computing the GCD of that prefix, then dividing each element in the prefix by that GCD. This can be done multiple times. However, each time we do this, the elements in the prefix are divided by a common factor, which may affect future GCDs.

Wait, but the order of operations might matter. For example, if we perform an operation on a prefix, then again on a longer prefix, but the GCDs might have changed. However, it's possible that after dividing by a GCD, the new elements have a GCD of 1, so further operations might not do anything. But maybe there's a smarter way to model the possible operations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each possible prefix and the factors we can divide out. Since each operation can be done any number of times, but each time the elements are divided by their GCD, perhaps the optimal strategy is to apply the operations in such a way that for each prefix, we divide out all possible factors that can contribute to a higher beauty.

Wait, but each operation on a prefix reduces the elements in that prefix. For example, if I first divide the first element by its GCD (which is itself), then the first element becomes 1. Then, if I apply another operation on a larger prefix that includes it, since the first element is 1, the GCD would be the GCD of 1 and the other elements, which is 1. So in that case, the operation would have no effect.

So maybe the optimal approach is to perform a sequence of operations where each operation is on a prefix that hasn't been divided yet. But this is a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a set of factors to divide each prefix such that the overall beauty is maximized. Let me think about this.

Each operation on a prefix r divides all elements in that prefix by their GCD. But since this can be done multiple times, the effect is cumulative. For example, if we perform the operation on prefix r once, then again, the GCD would be the GCD of the modified elements, which might be different. However, if the GCD after the first division is 1, then subsequent divisions on the same prefix have no effect. So, each prefix can be divided by multiple factors, but perhaps the optimal approach is to divide each prefix by all possible factors that can contribute to a better beauty, but in a way that the order of divisions is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps each element can be divided by a product of GCDs chosen for prefixes that include it. For example, element i is part of prefixes 1, 2, ..., i. So each time a prefix j >= i is divided by some g, element i is divided by that g. But since the GCD for a prefix j is the GCD of the elements up to j at the time of the operation, this becomes a bit complex.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a dynamic programming approach here. Let's consider the prefixes in order and track the possible GCDs that have been divided out so far, then decide whether to perform an operation on the current prefix.

Alternatively, let's model the process as a series of steps where for each prefix r, we can decide to divide it by some g, which is the GCD of the current elements up to r. But how does this affect the beauty?

Wait, the beauty is the sum of f(a[i]) after all operations. So for each a[i], after all divisions, the value is a[i] divided by all the GCDs of the prefixes that include it. Let's think about how the divisions affect each a[i].

Suppose we have a sequence of operations where for each k, we perform an operation on prefix r_k. Then, for each a[i], it is divided by the product of all GCDs of prefixes r >= i. Because each time a prefix r >= i is chosen, the GCD is computed (which includes a[i] at that time), and a[i] is divided by that GCD. So the final value of a[i] is the initial a[i] divided by the product of all GCDs chosen for prefixes that include i.

Wait, no. Because each operation's GCD depends on the current values of the elements in the prefix. So, when you perform an operation on a prefix, the elements are divided by the GCD of their current values. If you perform multiple operations on the same prefix, each subsequent operation's GCD is based on the elements after prior divisions.

But perhaps there's an optimal way to choose the operations such that for each prefix, you divide out as much as possible to maximize the beauty. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the order of operations doesn't matter. For example, if you process prefixes from left to right, and for each prefix, you choose to divide by the GCD as much as possible. Let's see.

Wait, when you divide a prefix by its GCD, the GCD of that prefix becomes 1. So any subsequent operations on the same prefix will not do anything. So each prefix can be operated on at most once. But that's only if the operation is applied after the previous divisions. Hmm, maybe. For example, suppose the GCD of a prefix is g. After division, the elements are a[i]/g for i in 1..r. The GCD of this new prefix is 1. So any further operations on this prefix would compute GCD=1 and divide by 1, which does nothing. Therefore, each prefix can be operated on at most once. So the number of possible operations is O(n), each on a different prefix, and in some order.

But the problem allows performing the operations in any order. So the order in which we apply the operations on prefixes affects the resulting values.

Wait, but suppose you first perform an operation on prefix r, then on prefix s > r. The operation on prefix s includes elements that were divided by the GCD of prefix r. Then, the GCD of prefix s is computed over the elements after the first operation. But this may allow for a larger GCD in the s prefix.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to process the prefixes in reverse order, from largest to smallest. Let's see: for example, when you process prefix n (the entire array) first. You divide all elements by their GCD. Then, processing smaller prefixes (like prefix n-1) would have elements that are already divided by that GCD. But the GCD of the entire array is now 1, so processing prefix n again would have no effect. Hmm, but maybe processing prefixes in a certain order allows us to extract more factors.

But how do we model this? Since each prefix can be operated on once, and the order affects the GCDs, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to perform operations on certain prefixes in such a way that each operation is applied to a prefix that is a superset of previous ones. For example, first operate on prefix 1, then prefix 2, up to prefix n. Or maybe the other way around.

But this is unclear. Let's think of the problem differently. Since each operation divides a prefix by its GCD, the effect is that the elements in the prefix are divided by that GCD, which is a factor common to all elements in the prefix. The key is to find for each element a[i], the product of the GCDs of the prefixes that include it. Each such GCD contributes a factor that divides a[i], and the final value of a[i] is a[i] divided by all these factors. Then, the f value of this final a[i] is added to the total beauty.

So, for each a[i], the factors by which it is divided are the GCDs of the prefixes that include it, applied in some order. However, since the GCD of a prefix depends on the current elements, the product of these GCDs is not necessarily the product of all possible GCDs but rather depends on the order of operations.

This seems complicated to model. Let's think about the possible factors that can be divided from each element. Each element's final value is a[i] divided by some product of divisors, each of which is the GCD of a prefix that includes it. But how do these divisors relate to the primes in the element's prime decomposition?

Alternatively, for each element a[i], the maximum possible division is the product of all possible GCDs of prefixes that include it. However, since the GCDs are determined based on the current elements (after previous divisions), perhaps the optimal strategy is to divide each a[i] by as many factors as possible that contribute positively to the beauty. That is, factors that, when divided out, lead to a higher sum of f values.

Wait, but each division of a prefix r affects all elements in that prefix. So for example, if I divide a prefix r by g, then all elements up to r are divided by g. This would affect their subsequent f values.

So the problem is to select a set of prefixes (with possible overlaps) and divide each by their respective GCDs (computed at the time of the operation) such that the sum of the f values of the resulting elements is maximized.

Hmm. Let's consider that each operation on a prefix r can be represented as a decision: whether to perform the operation, given the current state of the array, and how this affects the f values.

But given the constraints (n up to 5000), a brute-force approach is impossible. We need a dynamic programming approach that tracks the possible factors that have been divided out so far.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal set of operations is such that for each position i in the array, the GCDs applied to prefixes that include i form a chain. For example, the GCDs for prefixes 1, 2, ..., i.

But how?

Another approach: For each element a_i, after all operations, the value is a_i divided by some product of divisors. Let's denote for each element a_i the product of the divisors as d_i. The final value is a_i / d_i. Then, the f(a_i / d_i) contributes to the total beauty. We need to choose d_i's such that for each i, d_i is a product of GCDs of prefixes that include i, computed in some order.

But the problem is that d_i's are not independent. For example, if you divide a prefix r by g, then all elements 1..r have their d_i multiplied by g. So the choice of which prefixes to divide affects all elements in the prefix.

Thus, the key is to select a set of prefixes (r_1, r_2, ..., r_k) and compute the product of their GCDs for each element. But since the GCD of a prefix depends on the current elements (after previous divisions), this is non-trivial.

Wait, but perhaps the optimal strategy is to apply operations in such a way that each operation is on a prefix of increasing length. For example, process prefixes from left to right, and for each prefix, decide whether to apply the operation. Because once you process a prefix r, all elements up to r are divided by their GCD (which could be 1 after that), and then any further operations on larger prefixes would have their GCDs computed based on the modified elements.

This seems manageable. Let's model this with dynamic programming. Let's process the prefixes in order, from 1 to n, and for each prefix, decide whether to apply the operation (divide by the current GCD) or not. The state of the DP would track the current GCD product for each element up to the current prefix.

But how to model the state? Since the elements up to the current prefix have been divided by some factors, the GCD of the current elements in the prefix is crucial for the next decision.

Wait, perhaps for each position i in the array, when processing the prefix up to i, we can track the current GCD (after all previous operations) of the elements up to i. Then, for each i, we can choose to divide by this GCD, which would multiply the divisors of all elements up to i by the GCD, and then the new GCD for the next steps would be 1 (since all elements in the prefix are now divided by their previous GCD). Alternatively, we can choose not to divide, leaving the GCD as it is.

This seems promising. Let's formalize this.

Let's process the array from left to right. For each position i, we track two things:

1. The current GCD of the elements up to i (after all previous divisions).
2. The sum of the f values for the elements up to i.

At each step, for the i-th element, we can decide whether to perform the operation on the current prefix (up to i) or not.

If we decide not to perform the operation, then the current GCD remains the same as the GCD of the previous elements (up to i-1) and the current element (divided by its divisors so far). But this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the current GCD is the GCD of the elements up to i, considering all prior divisions.

Wait, when processing prefix i, the elements up to i have been divided by the GCDs chosen in previous operations. The GCD of these elements is some g. Then, the decision is whether to divide all elements up to i by g (thereby setting their new values to (current value) / g), which would make their GCD 1. The effect on the beauty is the sum of the f values of the elements up to i after this division, minus the sum before the division.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, for each i, we can track the possible divisors applied to the elements up to i. Let's define dp[i] as a dictionary where the keys are possible current GCDs of the elements up to i, and the values are the maximum possible beauty sum up to i for that GCD.

At each step, when processing element i+1, we can compute the possible GCDs and update the DP accordingly.

Wait, this might be a way to model it. Let's think:

Initially, for i=0 (before processing any elements), the GCD is 1 (since there are no elements), and the sum is 0.

When processing the first element a[0], we can compute the current GCD (which is a[0] divided by any divisors from previous operations). But since there are no previous operations, the current GCD is a[0]. Then, we have two choices:

1. Not perform the operation: the current GCD is a[0], and the sum is f(a[0]).

2. Perform the operation: divide a[0] by a[0], resulting in 1. The sum is f(1) = 0. The current GCD for the next steps is 1 (since the element is 1).

So, for the first element, the DP state would track two possibilities: GCD=1 (sum 0) and GCD=a[0] (sum f(a[0})).

But how do we proceed to the next elements?

For the second element (i=1), the current element is a[1] divided by any divisors from operations on prefixes that include it. But since we are processing prefixes in order, the operations on prefixes up to i=1 can only be performed once.

Wait, perhaps each step i corresponds to the i-th element (1-based?), and when considering the i-th element, the possible GCDs up to i are determined by the previous GCD and the current element's value divided by prior divisors.

This seems complex. Let's see:

Suppose after processing the first i elements, we have a set of possible GCDs. For each possible GCD g, we track the maximum possible sum of beauty up to i elements, given that the current GCD of the first i elements is g.

When processing the (i+1)-th element (a[i+1]), which is the (i+1)-th element divided by all divisors from prior operations. But how?

Wait, perhaps the current GCD for the first i+1 elements can be computed as the GCD of the GCD of the first i elements and the (i+1)-th element's current value. The current value of the (i+1)-th element is the original a[i+1] divided by the product of all divisors chosen in operations on prefixes that include it.

But this is not tracked in the DP state. So, perhaps the DP state should track the product of divisors applied to each element up to i. However, that's impossible for n=5000.

Alternatively, perhaps the current GCD of the first i elements is the GCD of their original values divided by the product of all divisors chosen in operations on their prefixes. Wait, but the divisors are applied in a way that each operation on a prefix r divides all elements up to r by the GCD at that time.

So, for example, if we first perform an operation on prefix 2, then the elements 1 and 2 are divided by the GCD of the original a[1] and a[2]. Then, if we perform an operation on prefix 3, the elements 1-3 are divided by the GCD of the modified elements (after the first division). So the divisors multiply, but the order of operations affects the factors.

This is very tricky. Let's think again: the key is that when you perform an operation on a prefix r, you divide all elements in that prefix by their current GCD. Therefore, the factors that each element is divided by are the product of the GCDs of all prefixes that include it and are operated on.

But how to model this in a way that allows for an efficient solution?

Another observation: Each element can be divided by the GCD of its prefix at the moment when the prefix is operated on. The order of operations matters for the GCDs. But perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved by dividing each prefix exactly once, in such a way that each element is divided by all possible beneficial factors.

Wait, perhaps for each prefix, the optimal decision is to divide by the GCD if doing so increases the sum of f values for the elements in the prefix. But how to compute this.

Alternatively, consider that dividing a prefix by g reduces each element in the prefix by a factor of g. The effect on the sum is the sum of (f(a[i]/g) - f(a[i])) for each element in the prefix. So, the total change is the sum of (delta_i), where delta_i is the difference in f(a[i]/g) minus f(a[i]). We need to decide whether this total delta is positive; if yes, then performing the operation is beneficial.

But this depends on the current value of a[i], which is divided by the product of all previous factors. So for each prefix, when considering whether to perform the operation, we need to compute the current GCD of the prefix (which is the GCD of the elements in the prefix after all previous divisions) and then compute the delta.

But how to compute the delta for all elements in the prefix efficiently?

Hmm. Let's think of it this way: When we process the prefix up to position r, the current GCD of the elements up to r is g. If we divide them by g, then each element's value becomes (current value) / g. The delta for each element is the difference in their f value after and before the division.

So, the total delta is the sum of (f(x/g) - f(x)) for each x in the current elements up to r. If this delta is positive, then performing the operation increases the total beauty.

But how to compute this delta quickly?

The key challenge here is to compute, for a given g, the sum of (f(x/g) - f(x)) for all x in the current elements up to r. To do this, we need to precompute the f values for all possible x/g and x, but that's not feasible for large x.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute the f value for each possible x and for all possible divisors of x. But since x can be up to 1e9, this is impossible.

Another approach: For each possible x and a divisor g of x, f(x/g) can be computed based on the minimal prime of x/g. But since x/g is a divisor of x, and x's prime factors are known, perhaps we can compute this efficiently.

Wait, but first, let's precompute the f values for all elements in the array. Then, when we divide by some g, compute the new f value.

But even this is not straightforward. Let's think:

The function f(s) depends on the minimal prime divisor of s. So for each element a[i], after dividing by a factor g, the new s is a[i]/g. But the minimal prime divisor of a[i]/g may change.

So, for each a[i] and possible g, we need to compute f(a[i]/g) efficiently. But since g can be any divisor of a[i], this is a lot.

However, in the problem, the operations divide by GCDs of prefixes. So for each element, the factors by which it is divided are the product of GCDs chosen for prefixes that include it. Each such GCD is a divisor of the element's value at the time of the operation.

This suggests that the factors are built up as products of divisors chosen during each operation. But this again complicates the modeling.

Alternative idea: For each element, the final value is a[i] divided by some product of factors. Each factor is the GCD of a prefix that includes the element. But these factors are applied in sequence, and each GCD is computed based on the elements after previous divisions.

This seems really difficult to model. So perhaps we need to find a way to represent the state in the DP such that the current GCD of the prefix up to i is tracked, and for each step, we can decide whether to divide by that GCD.

So, here's the plan:

We'll process the array from left to right, maintaining a dynamic programming state that tracks the current GCD of the elements processed so far (after all prior divisions) and the maximum possible sum of f values up to that point.

At each step i, for the i-th element, we can:

- Compute the current GCD of the elements up to i (which is GCD of the previous GCD and the current element's value after prior divisions).
- Then, decide whether to perform the operation (divide the prefix up to i by this GCD) or not.

If we choose not to perform the operation, the current GCD remains the GCD computed, and the sum is the previous sum plus the f value of the current element (divided by the product of prior factors).

If we choose to perform the operation, the elements up to i are divided by the current GCD. This means that their new value is (current value) / GCD. The sum for these elements becomes the previous sum plus the sum of f((element / prior factors) / GCD) for each element up to i. The new GCD for the next steps is 1, since the elements are now divided by their GCD.

Wait, but when we perform the operation, all elements up to i are divided by their current GCD. So their new GCD is 1. So for the next steps, when considering the next elements, their GCDs would be based on these new values.

So, the DP state can be represented as follows:

- For each position i, track all possible current GCDs of the elements up to i (after prior divisions) and the maximum sum of beauty up to i for that GCD.

At each step, when processing element i+1:

1. Compute the possible new GCDs for not dividing.

   The new GCD is GCD(g_prev, x), where g_prev is the GCD from the previous state, and x is the current element's value (after prior divisions, which is a[i+1] divided by the product of factors chosen in operations that include it).

   Wait, but how is x computed? Because the current element's value depends on whether we have performed operations on prefixes that include it. For example, if we are processing element i+1, and the current GCD for the elements up to i is g_prev, then the element i+1's value is a[i+1] divided by any factors from prior operations. But since we process elements in order, the element i+1 hasn't been part of any prior operations except those up to i. Wait, no. Because the operations can be on any prefixes. But in our DP approach, we're processing elements in order and considering operations on the prefix up to the current element.

Hmm, perhaps the DP approach can model the current GCD of the elements processed so far (up to i), and when processing element i+1, the current element's value is a[i+1] divided by all factors chosen in operations on prefixes that include i+1. But how are these factors tracked?

This seems impossible. So perhaps the DP approach is not feasible for this problem.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem's note in the sample input:

The sample input 2 has the array [2,4,8,16] and the bad primes are [3,5,7,11,17]. The answer is 10, which is higher than the initial sum. Let's see why.

The initial elements:

For 2: minimal prime is 2, which is bad (assuming the bad primes are 3,5,7,11,17; 2 is good). So f(2) = f(2/2) +1 = f(1)+1=0+1=1.

Wait, no. Wait, the bad primes are 3,5,7,11,17, so 2 is good. So f(2) = f(2/2) +1 = f(1)+1=1.

Similarly, for 4: minimal prime is 2. So f(4) = f(4/2) +1 = f(2) +1 = 1+1=2.

For 8: f(8) = f(4) +1 = 2+1=3.

For 16: f(16) =3+1=4.

Sum is 1+2+3+4=10. Which matches the sample's output. So the initial sum is already 10. So in this case, no operations are needed. But why?

Because when you perform an operation on a prefix, you divide all elements in the prefix by their GCD. For example, the GCD of the entire array is 2. Dividing each element by 2 gives [1,2,4,8]. The f values then become:

1: 0

2:1 (since 2 is good. f(2) =1)

4:2 (f(4/2) = f(2) +1 = 2)

8:3 (f(8/2=4) → 2+1=3).

Sum is 0+1+2+3=6, which is worse than 10. So in this case, not performing any operations is better.

Hmm. So the key is to determine for each prefix whether dividing it by its GCD would improve the sum. But how?

Let me think of the delta when dividing a prefix by its GCD. For each element in the prefix, the delta is f(s/g) - f(s), where s is the current value (after prior divisions) and g is the GCD of the prefix.

So, the total delta for the operation is the sum over all elements in the prefix of (f(s/g) - f(s)).

If this delta is positive, performing the operation increases the total sum, so it's beneficial.

But how to compute this delta for all possible prefixes and possible GCDs?

An important observation: For the elements in a prefix, after dividing by their GCD, each element s becomes s/g. Since g is the GCD of the elements in the prefix, each element s is a multiple of g. So s/g is an integer.

Moreover, since g is the GCD of the elements, the GCD of the elements after dividing by g is 1. So any subsequent operations on this prefix will have no effect.

Thus, for each prefix, we can compute whether performing the operation (dividing by the current GCD) improves the sum, and if so, perform it. But since the order of processing prefixes affects the GCDs, this complicates things.

However, if we process the prefixes in reverse order (from n downto 1), perhaps each decision can be made greedily. For example, when processing a prefix, we can decide whether to divide it by its current GCD, considering that all larger prefixes have already been processed (or not), which may have affected the elements in this prefix.

But this is unclear.

Another idea: The problem allows us to perform any number of operations in any order. Each operation divides a prefix by its current GCD. Since after division, the GCD becomes 1, performing the same operation again would have no effect. So each prefix can be operated on at most once.

Thus, the total number of possible operations is n (each prefix can be operated on once). But the order of operations matters.

So, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of prefixes to operate on, in an order, such that the sum of f values is maximized.

But how to model this?

Another observation: The order of operations affects the GCD of prefixes. For example, if you first operate on prefix r, then on prefix s > r. The first operation divides the first r elements by their GCD (g1). The second operation divides the first s elements by their current GCD (which is GCD(g1, GCD(r+1..s)), but after division by g1, the elements up to r are 1, so the GCD of the entire prefix s would be GCD(1, ...) which is the GCD of elements r+1 to s after division by any factors from prior operations.

This is complicated, but perhaps the optimal strategy is to process the prefixes from largest to smallest, because dividing a larger prefix first would not affect smaller prefixes. Or perhaps the other way around.

Alternatively, let's consider that each operation on prefix r can be done only once. So the set of operations can be represented as a sequence of prefixes, possibly with overlapping, but each can be done once.

But given the time constraints, we need an O(n^2) approach.

Hmm. Let's think of the following approach:

For each possible prefix r (from 1 to n), compute the optimal decision (whether to operate on it or not), considering the impact of previous operations.

But how?

Another angle: For each element a[i], the factors by which it is divided are the product of the GCDs of all prefixes r >= i that have been operated on. Because each time you operate on a prefix r >= i, the element is divided by the GCD of that prefix (computed at the time of the operation).

The GCD of the prefix r is the GCD of the elements up to r after any prior divisions. But when you operate on a prefix r, the elements up to r are divided by their GCD. This makes the GCD of those elements 1, so any further operations on prefixes >= r will not affect them.

So, the optimal strategy is to decide for each prefix r, whether to operate on it (divide by its current GCD), and the order in which to do so. However, after operating on prefix r, any prefix s >= r will have their GCD affected by the division of elements up to r.

This is getting too vague. Perhaps there's a way to model the problem using dynamic programming where the state is the current GCD of the entire array processed so far, and the maximum possible sum.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

We can model the problem using dynamic programming where for each prefix i (processed up to the i-th element), we track the possible current GCD of the entire prefix (after all prior operations) and the maximum sum achievable.

When processing the i-th element, the current GCD is the GCD of the previous GCD (from the i-1 prefix) and the current element's value after prior divisions.

At each step, we have two choices:

1. Do not perform the operation on the current prefix (i). Then, the current GCD is the GCD of the previous GCD and the current element's value (divided by any prior factors). The sum is increased by the f value of the current element (divided by prior factors).

2. Perform the operation on the current prefix. This requires calculating the current GCD (g), then dividing all elements up to i by g. This results in the elements up to i being divided by g. The sum is increased by the sum of f(s/g) for each element up to i, where s is their value before division. The new GCD for the next steps is 1.

However, this approach would require tracking all possible GCDs for each prefix. For example, after processing i elements, the GCD could be any divisor of the product of the elements up to i, which is not feasible for n=5000.

But perhaps the number of distinct GCDs encountered during processing is manageable, especially since each step's GCD is the GCD of the previous GCD and the current element.

This is the key. For each step, the possible GCDs are the divisors of the current element's value and the previous GCD. Thus, the number of possible GCDs at each step is limited by the number of divisors of the current element and the previous GCD.

Given that each a[i] can be up to 1e9, but the number of divisors for any number up to 1e9 is at most 1008 (for a number like 735134400), but on average much smaller, this might be feasible.

Thus, the dynamic programming approach can proceed as follows:

- Initialize a dictionary (prev_dp) that tracks possible GCDs and their corresponding maximum sum. Initially, after processing 0 elements, there's nothing, so the GCD is undefined. Wait, perhaps for the first element, the initial GCD is a[0] divided by factors from prior operations (which is none). So for the first element, we can compute the possible GCDs by considering whether to perform the operation or not.

Wait, let's try to formalize this:

We process elements from left to right. For each element i (1-based?), we maintain a DP dictionary that maps a GCD value g (of the elements up to i) to the maximum possible sum achievable up to i with that GCD.

Initially, for i=0 (no elements processed), the DP is empty. When processing the first element a[0], the possible choices are:

- Do not operate: GCD is a[0], sum is f(a[0]).
- Operate: divide by a[0], so elements become 1. GCD is 1, sum is f(1) = 0.

So the DP after first element has two entries: GCD a[0] with sum f(a[0]), and GCD 1 with sum 0.

For the next elements, we proceed as follows:

For each possible GCD g in the previous DP (for the first i elements), we compute the new possible GCDs when adding the (i+1)-th element (a[i]).

The new GCD is gcd(g, a[i] / d), where d is the product of divisors from prior operations. But wait, this is not tracked. So how can we model this?

Ah, this is where the problem gets tricky. Because the current element's value depends on the operations performed on prefixes that include it. However, since we are processing elements left to right and only considering operations on the current prefix (up to i+1), perhaps the (i+1)-th element's value is the original a[i+1] divided by the product of GCDs of prefixes up to i+1 that include it. But this is not directly tracked.

Alternatively, perhaps when processing the (i+1)-th element, the current value is the original a[i+1] divided by the product of all GCDs of prefixes that include it. But how to model this in the DP.

Alternatively, perhaps the current element's value is a[i+1] divided by the product of the GCDs of all prefixes that include it. But when processing elements left to right, the current element's value is only affected by operations on prefixes up to the current position. So for the (i+1)-th element, the value is a[i+1] divided by the product of all GCDs of prefixes r >= i+1 that have been operated on. But this is again not directly trackable.

This suggests that the DP approach may not be feasible due to the dependencies on prior operations.

Alternative idea inspired by the problem's sample:

For each element, the optimal way to process it is to divide out all possible good primes from it, as each good prime division adds 1 to the f value. Bad primes subtract 1.

But the problem is that dividing by a GCD affects multiple elements and depends on the current state.

Alternatively, think of the f(s) as the number of good primes in the minimal prime decomposition path minus the number of bad primes in the same path.

Each time you divide by the minimal prime, which is good or bad, and the function f accumulates this.

For example, s can be represented as p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... where p1 is the minimal prime. Then, f(s) is 1 (if p1 is good) plus f(s/p1), or -1 plus f(s/p1) if p1 is bad.

Thus, the f(s) can be precomputed for each possible s by decomposing it into its minimal primes.

But how to compute this efficiently for a large number of elements?

The key here is to precompute f for all elements in the array, and then for each possible division by a GCD, compute the new f value.

But again, for large elements, this is challenging.

Wait, but perhaps the f function can be computed using a memoization approach. For example, for each element x, we can compute f(x) by finding its minimal prime factor, check if it's good or bad, and recursively compute f(x / p).

We can memoize this computation to avoid redundant calculations.

So, first, precompute all primes up to sqrt(1e9) to factorize numbers quickly. Then, for each a[i], compute f(a[i]).

But even this may be time-consuming for n=5000, but since each a[i] is up to 1e9, and factorization of 5000 numbers may be manageable with optimized trial division.

But then, when considering dividing elements by their GCD, we need to compute f(x/g) for each x in the prefix, which could be time-consuming.

Another idea: For each x, precompute all possible values of f(x/g) for all possible g that are divisors of x. But this is not feasible for large x.

Alternatively, since when dividing by g (the GCD of the prefix), which is a divisor of each x in the prefix, the minimal primes of x/g may be different from x's. However, the function f can be computed recursively for x/g.

But if we have to compute f(x/g) on the fly for each x and g, this could be computationally intensive. However, memoization can help here.

So, the steps could be:

1. Precompute the set of bad primes for O(1) lookups.

2. Precompute the function f(s) for all possible s that could appear in the array or after divisions. But since s can be as large as 1e9 divided by 1 (i.e., up to 1e9), memoization would require a lot of memory. So, instead, compute f(s) recursively with memoization.

But even with memoization, for large s, the number of unique calls could be large, but given that each a[i] is up to 1e9 and the test cases are limited, perhaps it's manageable.

Now, back to the problem. Let's consider that for each prefix, the decision to divide by the current GCD depends on whether the sum of f(x/g) for x in the prefix is better than the sum of f(x).

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Perhaps the optimal approach is to precompute for each element x, the sum of f(x/g) - f(x) for all possible divisors g of x. Then, for a given prefix, the sum delta is the sum over the elements of (f(x/g) - f(x)), where g is the GCD of the prefix.

But this seems impractical.

Alternative plan:

We need to find the set of prefixes to operate on such that the total sum of the f values after all operations is maximized.

Assume that we process prefixes in order from 1 to n. For each prefix r, compute the current GCD of the elements up to r (after prior operations), and decide whether to divide by this GCD.

But the current GCD depends on the elements' values after prior divisions. So, when processing prefix r, the elements up to r have been divided by all GCDs chosen for prefixes up to r-1.

Wait, but this is not the case. If we process prefix r in order, then the elements up to r have been divided by the GCDs chosen for prefixes 1, 2, ..., r-1. So, for example, if we have previously operated on prefix 5, then elements up to 5 are divided by that GCD. When processing prefix 10, the elements up to 10 have been divided by all GCDs chosen for prefixes up to 9 and 10.

But this is not correct, because prefixes can be operated on in any order. However, if we process them in order and decide for each prefix whether to operate on it, then the previous divisions are only those prefixes that were processed before.

This suggests that the decision for prefix r can be made based on the current state of the elements up to r.

But how to model this?

Maybe the answer is to use dynamic programming, where for each prefix r, we track the possible GCD of the elements up to r after all prior operations, and the maximum sum of f values up to r. When processing prefix r, the decision to divide or not depends on the current GCD.

So, the dynamic programming state would be:

dp[r][g] = maximum sum achievable up to prefix r, where the current GCD of the elements up to r is g.

To transition from r to r+1:

For each possible GCD g_prev in dp[r], and the next element a[r+1] (divided by prior factors), compute the new GCD when adding this element.

This new GCD is gcd(g_prev, a[r+1] / product_of_factors). But product_of_factors is the product of all GCDs chosen for prefixes that include r+1, which is unknown.

This is the crux of the problem. The product_of_factors for element r+1 depends on the operations chosen for prefixes that include it, which haven't been processed yet.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the problem's constraints:

Each operation on a prefix r divides the elements up to r by their GCD. The result is that the elements' values are divided by g, and their new GCD is 1. Therefore, any subsequent operations on prefixes that include r will have no effect on these elements (since their GCD is 1).

Thus, once you operate on a prefix r, you can't get any further benefit from operating on prefixes that include r. Hence, it's optimal to operate on prefixes in a way that maximizes the sum of deltas, and once a prefix is operated on, any larger prefixes that include it cannot be operated on again.

Wait, no. Because operating on a larger prefix (s > r) after operating on r would compute the GCD of elements up to s, which includes elements divided by the GCD of r. The GCD of these elements could be something other than 1. For example, if after dividing prefix r by g, the elements r+1 to s are not divided by any factors, their GCD could be a new value. Then, operating on prefix s would divide all elements up to s by their current GCD (which could be the GCD of 1's and the elements r+1 to s).

But this depends on the elements.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's think of a different approach.

Suppose we process the prefixes in reverse order. For each prefix r from n downto 1, compute whether operating on it would improve the sum. If yes, perform the operation and divide all elements up to r by the current GCD.

But how to compute the current GCD of the elements up to r, given that elements after r may have been divided by their own GCDs.

This seems challenging. But perhaps by processing in reverse order, we can avoid the dependency on future operations.

For example, when processing prefix r, the elements up to r have not been modified by any operations on prefixes larger than r (since we are processing in reverse). So the current GCD of the elements up to r is the GCD of their original values divided by any factors from previous operations (those on prefixes >= r).

But I'm not sure.

Another observation: Each operation on prefix r can be considered as a decision that affects all elements up to r. The delta is the sum of f(a[i]/g) - f(a[i]) for each i up to r. If this delta is positive, then performing the operation is beneficial.

But the key is to compute the maximum possible sum of these deltas across all chosen prefixes.

However, the order in which operations are performed affects the deltas. For example, if you first operate on prefix r, then the elements up to r are divided by g, and any subsequent operation on a larger prefix s will have elements up to s divided by g (if they are part of prefix r). This changes their contribution to the delta of the prefix s.

But how to model this without considering all possible orders?

An alternative approach is to model the problem as a graph, where each node represents the current state of the array (or some summary of it), and edges represent the choice of operating on a particular prefix. But for n=5000, this is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Since each operation on a prefix r can only be done once, and the order of operations affects the outcome, perhaps the optimal strategy is to operate on a set of non-overlapping prefixes in a way that maximizes the sum of deltas. But this is not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to operate on all prefixes for which the delta is positive. But the problem is that the delta for a prefix depends on the current state of the elements, which is influenced by prior operations.

Thus, this requires a greedy approach where, for each prefix, we decide whether to operate on it based on the current state.

But how to determine the optimal order.

Another observation: The delta for a prefix r is the sum of the changes in f values for the elements up to r when divided by their current GCD. If the delta is positive, operating on the prefix increases the total sum.

However, the delta depends on the current GCD of the prefix, which is the GCD of the elements up to r after all prior operations. So, the order of processing prefixes affects the current GCD and thus the delta.

To maximize the total sum, we need to process the prefixes in an order that allows us to capture the largest possible deltas first.

This suggests that the optimal order is to process prefixes in the order of the largest possible delta first. However, this is not straightforward to implement.

But given the time constraints, perhaps we can model this as follows:

For each prefix r from n downto 1, compute the current GCD of the elements up to r (assuming no prior operations have been performed on any prefixes), and compute the delta if we operate on this prefix. If the delta is positive, perform the operation and divide all elements up to r by the GCD. Repeat this process for smaller prefixes.

But this approach ignores the fact that prior operations may have already divided elements up to r by some factors, thus changing the current GCD.

But in the reverse order, processing prefix r after larger prefixes (s > r) may not have affected the elements up to r. So, the current GCD of prefix r is the original GCD of the elements up to r, divided by the product of factors from operations on prefixes s > r. But since we are processing in reverse order, the factors from larger prefixes have already been applied.

Thus, when processing prefix r in reverse order, the elements up to r have already been divided by the GCDs of prefixes s > r. So, the current GCD of the elements up to r is the original GCD divided by the product of those factors. But how to compute this?

This seems like a viable approach.

Let's outline this approach step by step:

1. Initialize the current array as the original array.

2. Initialize the total sum as the sum of f(a[i]) for the original array.

3. Process prefixes from n downto 1:

   a. For each prefix r, compute the current GCD of the elements up to r.

   b. Compute the delta: sum of f(a[i]/g) - f(a[i]) for i=1 to r.

   c. If delta is positive:

      i. Add delta to the total sum.

      ii. Divide all elements up to r by g.

4. After processing all prefixes, return the total sum.

This approach works under the assumption that operating on larger prefixes first, then smaller ones, allows us to apply the maximum possible beneficial divisions. However, is this correct?

Let's test this with the first sample input:

Sample input 1:

5 2

4 20 34 10 10

Bad primes: 2,5.

Original array: [4, 20, 34, 10, 10]

Original sum of f values:

For each element:

4: minimal prime is 2 (bad). f(4) = f(4/2) -1 = f(2) -1. 2 is bad. f(2) = f(1) -1 = -1. So f(4) = -1 -1 = -2.

20: minimal prime is 2. f(20) = f(10) -1. 10's minimal is 2, f(10) = f(5) -1. 5 is bad. f(5) = f(1) -1 = -1. So f(10) = -1 -1 = -2. f(20) = -2 -1 = -3.

34: minimal prime is 2. f(34) = f(17) -1. 17 is good. f(17) = f(1) +1 = 1. So f(34) = 1 -1 = 0.

10: same as before, f is -2.

10: same, -2.

Sum is (-2) + (-3) + 0 + (-2) + (-2) = -9.

Sample output is -2. So the optimal solution is better than the initial sum.

When processing in reverse order (prefixes 5,4,3,2,1):

For prefix 5 (all elements):

Current elements are [4, 20,34,10,10]. GCD is 2.

delta is sum of f(x/2) - f(x) for each element.

Compute f(x/2):

4/2=2 → f(2) = -1 → delta: -1 - (-2) = 1.

20/2=10 → f(10) is -2 → delta: -2 - (-3) = 1.

34/2=17 → f(17) is 1 → delta: 1 -0 =1.

10/2=5 → f(5) is -1 → delta: -1 - (-2) =1.

10/2=5 → delta: 1.

Sum delta: 1+1+1+1+1 =5. So total sum becomes -9 +5 = -4. Then, divide all elements by 2 → [2,10,17,5,5].

Next, process prefix 4:

Elements up to 4 are [2,10,17,5]. GCD is 1. Delta is 0, so no change.

Processing prefix 3: elements [2,10,17]. GCD is 1. Delta 0.

Prefix 2: [2,10]. GCD is 2. delta is sum(f(2/2) - f(2) + f(10/2) -f(10)) → f(1)=0 - (-1) → delta for 2 is 1. f(5) is -1 - (-2) → 1. So delta is 2. Adding this to sum gives -4 + 2 = -2. Divide elements up to 2 by 2 → [1,5]. Now, the array is [1,5,17,5,5].

Processing prefix 1: element 1. GCD is 1. Delta 0.

Final sum is -2, which matches the sample.

So the approach of processing in reverse order and applying each operation if the delta is positive works for the first sample.

Another test with sample input 2:

Original sum is 10. Processing in reverse order:

Prefix 4 (entire array). GCD is 2. delta is sum of f(16/2) - f(16), etc.

Wait, the array is [2,4,8,16].

Original sum is 1+2+3+4=10.

Processing in reverse order:

Prefix 4 (all elements): GCD is 2. Dividing by 2 gives [1,2,4,8]. The delta for each element:

2/2=1 → f(1)=0 → delta 0 -1 = -1.

4/2=2 → delta 1-2 =-1.

8/2=4 → delta 2-3 =-1.

16/2=8 → delta 3-4 =-1.

Sum delta: -1*4 =-4. Not beneficial, so no change.

Next prefixes 3, 2, 1: their GCDs are 2, 2, 2, respectively. Delta for each would be negative. So no operations are performed. Sum remains 10.

So the approach works for sample 2.

Thus, the approach of processing prefixes in reverse order and applying the operation if delta is positive seems to work.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Precompute the function f for all possible values.

2. For the current array, compute the sum of f values.

3. Process each prefix r from n downto 1:

   a. Compute the GCD of the current elements up to r.

   b. Compute the delta: sum of f(current_elements[i] / g) - f(current_elements[i]) for i=0 to r-1.

   c. If delta > 0:

      i. Add delta to the total sum.

      ii. Divide each element up to r by g.

4. Return the total sum.

The key steps are:

- Efficiently compute the GCD for each prefix.

- Efficiently compute the delta for each prefix.

- Efficiently update the array elements when dividing by the GCD.

But for n=5000, this approach would require O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=5000 (5000^2 = 25 million operations).

But how to compute the GCD for each prefix efficiently?

For each prefix r (processed in reverse order), the GCD of the elements up to r is the GCD of the current elements. Since after processing a prefix s > r, the elements up to s have been divided by their GCD. But since we process r in reverse order, the elements up to r are not modified by processing larger prefixes. So, for prefix r, the elements up to r are in their original state, modified only by operations on prefixes larger than r.

Wait, no. When processing prefixes in reverse order, after processing prefix s (s > r), the elements up to s are divided by their GCD. So, when processing prefix r, the elements up to r have been modified by operations on prefixes larger than r. For example, if s=5 and r=3, processing prefix 5 may divide elements 1-5, then processing prefix 3 may divide elements 1-3. But when processing prefix 3, the elements 1-3 have already been divided by the GCD of prefix 5 if 5 was processed first.

But in reverse order, we process prefix 5 first. So, elements 1-5 are divided by their GCD (say g5). Then, when processing prefix 3, the elements up to 3 are those from the original array divided by g5. The GCD of these elements is computed, and if we divide by g3, then elements up to 3 are divided by g3.

Thus, for each prefix r, the elements up to r are the original elements divided by the product of the GCDs of prefixes s > r that include them.

But when processing in reverse order, the elements up to r are modified by operations on prefixes s >= r. So, when processing r, the elements up to r are already divided by the GCDs of prefixes s > r.

Thus, the algorithm correctly processes prefixes in reverse order, capturing the maximum possible benefit.

But to compute the GCD of the current elements up to r, we need to compute the GCD of the modified elements (after any previous divisions). Thus, for each prefix r, we need to compute the GCD of the elements up to r in their current state.

To compute this efficiently, we can iterate through the elements from 1 to r (assuming 1-based indices) and compute the GCD step by step. However, for large r, this is O(r) time, leading to O(n^2) total time for all prefixes. Which is acceptable for n=5000.

The steps in code would be:

- Initialize the array as a list.

- Compute the initial sum by calculating f for each element.

- Iterate r from n downto 1:

   a. Compute the GCD of the first r elements.

      i. Initialize current_gcd = array[0].

      ii. For i in 1 to r-1:

          current_gcd = gcd(current_gcd, array[i]).

          if current_gcd == 1, break.

   b. Compute the delta: sum over the first r elements of (f(element / current_gcd) - f(element)).

   c. If delta > 0:

      i. Add delta to the total sum.

      ii. Divide each of the first r elements by current_gcd.

Thus, the code will have a nested loop: for each prefix r, compute the GCD in O(r) time, compute the delta in O(r) time, and possibly divide the elements in O(r) time. For n=5000, this is O(n^2) time.

But for n=5000, O(n^2) is 25 million operations, which should be manageable in Python within 1 second.

But wait, for each of the 5000 prefixes, the inner loop for computing GCD and delta is O(r). The total time is sum_{r=1 to 5000} r = 5000*5001/2 ≈ 12.5 million operations. Each operation involves computing a GCD and possibly other steps. Python's built-in math.gcd function is optimized, but it's for positive integers. However, since we are dividing elements by their GCDs, the elements are integers greater than or equal to 1.

But there's a problem: the elements can be zero if divided by their GCD (which is the element itself). Wait, no. When you divide a number by its GCD (which is the current GCD of the prefix), the result is an integer >=1, because the GCD is a divisor of the current elements. For example, if the current element is 4 and the GCD is 2, dividing by 2 gives 2. If the GCD is 4, dividing by 4 gives 1. So, the elements are always >=1.

Thus, the GCD computation is valid.

Another point: the GCD function in Python's math module returns the absolute value of the GCD, but since all elements are positive, this is not a problem.

Thus, the code can proceed as outlined.

Now, the remaining task is to compute the function f(s) efficiently.

Computing f(s) recursively with memoization:

We can memoize the results of f(s) for all s encountered. For each s, we find the minimal prime divisor, check if it's bad, and compute f(s) based on that.

But how to find the minimal prime divisor of s efficiently.

To compute the minimal prime factor (mpf) of a number s, we can factorize s.

Factorizing s can be done via trial division up to sqrt(s), checking for divisibility starting from 2.

But for s up to 1e9, trial division is manageable for numbers up to 1e9, especially since the function f is memoized and each s will be factorized only once.

So, the plan is:

- Preprocess the set of bad primes into a hash set for O(1) lookups.

- For a given s, compute its minimal prime factor:

   a. If s is 1, return 0.

   b. Check divisibility by 2, then odd numbers up to sqrt(s). The first divisor is the minimal prime.

   c. If no divisors found, then s is a prime, and its minimal prime is itself.

Once the minimal prime is found, check if it's in the bad primes set. If it is, then f(s) = f(s/p) -1. Otherwise, f(s) = f(s/p) +1.

This is a recursive process, which can be memoized.

Implementing this in Python with memoization:

Use a dictionary to memoize the computed f values.

But for numbers up to 1e9, the memoization could be memory-intensive. However, in practice, the numbers encountered during the algorithm are limited by the original array and the divisions by GCDs. For example, each division reduces the elements' values, so the numbers s encountered are factors of the original elements, which are up to 1e9. The number of unique s values can be large, but with memoization, we can avoid redundant computations.

Now, the code structure:

Read n and m.

Read the array a.

Read the bad primes into a set.

Precompute the set of bad primes.

Memoize the f function.

Compute the initial sum.

Process each prefix in reverse order.

For each prefix r:

   Compute current_gcd of a[0..r-1].

   Compute delta: sum of f(a[i] / current_gcd) - f(a[i]) for i=0..r-1.

   If delta > 0:

      total_sum += delta

      divide each a[i] for i=0..r-1 by current_gcd.

Output total_sum.

Now, the code:

First, handling the f function:

Implement a memoized function for f(s):

def f(s, memo, bad_primes):
    if s == 1:
        return 0
    if s in memo:
        return memo[s]
    # Find minimal prime divisor
    if s % 2 == 0:
        mp = 2
    else:
        mp = s
        for i in range(3, int(s**0.5) +1, 2):
            if s % i == 0:
                mp = i
                break
    if mp in bad_primes:
        res = f(s // mp, memo, bad_primes) -1
    else:
        res = f(s // mp, memo, bad_primes) +1
    memo[s] = res
    return res

But for s=1, returns 0.

But when s is divided by current_gcd, which could be a large number, s//mp may be 1, which is handled correctly.

Now, the code:

Implement the steps:

Sample 2:

The initial sum is 10. For each r=4, the current_gcd is 2. delta is sum of:

2/2=1 → delta 0-1= -1.

4/2=2 → delta 1-2= -1.

8/2=4 → delta 2-3= -1.

16/2=8 → delta 3-4= -1.

sum delta is -4. So no change. So the sum remains 10.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

Now, the code needs to be optimized for speed. Possible optimizations:

1. Precompute the f values for the original array and cache them.

But the code already uses memoization.

2. Precompute the current_gcd in a more efficient way. For example, using a segment tree or other data structure to compute the GCD for any range in O(1) time. But for n=5000, this is not necessary.

3. Avoid repeated divisions in the array. For example, when processing prefix r, dividing each element by current_gcd. But for large r, this is O(r) time.

But given the constraints, it's manageable.

Another possible optimization is to memoize the f function using lru_cache, but since the input numbers can be up to 1e9, the memoization cache may become too large. Using a dictionary is better in this case.

But in Python, function calls are expensive. To speed up the compute_f function, we can precompute the minimal primes for all numbers up to a certain limit. But this is not feasible for 1e9.

Alternatively, optimize the minimal prime computation:

For the compute_f function, when looking for the minimal prime divisor, first check if the number is even. If yes, then mp is 2. Otherwise, check up to sqrt(s) with step 2.

This is already implemented.

Another optimization is to precompute all primes up to sqrt(1e9) (which is 3e4) using sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, for each number, check divisibility by the primes in order. But this would require generating primes up to 3e4, which is manageable. However, for numbers up to 1e9, even this may not save time compared to trial division.

Thus, the code as written should be acceptable.

Now, the code should handle all cases correctly.
