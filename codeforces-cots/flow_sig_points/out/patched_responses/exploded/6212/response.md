Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum paint required to color the uncolored trees such that the beauty (number of contiguous groups) is exactly k. If it's not possible, return -1.

First, I need to understand the constraints. The maximum n is 100, m is 100. The beauty has to be exactly k, which can be up to n. So, how do I model this?

Hmm, dynamic programming might be the way to go here. Because for each position, the choice of color affects the current group and the next group. The key parameters in the DP would be the current position, the current number of groups formed, and the last color used. That way, we can track transitions where adding a new color either continues the current group or starts a new one.

Let's think about the state. Let's define dp[i][j][c] as the minimum paint required to color the first i trees, forming j groups, and the last group's color is c. The transitions would be:

For the (i+1)th tree, which can be either already colored (fixed color) or uncolored (choose a color from 1..m):

- If the next tree's color is the same as the current last color (c), then the number of groups remains the same (j).
- If the next tree's color is different, then the number of groups increases by 1 (j+1).

But we need to handle cases where the existing trees are already colored. So, for each tree, if it's already colored (ci != 0), we can't change it. Only the 0s can be colored.

So the DP approach would need to track:

- Current position (i from 0 to n)
- Number of groups formed so far (j from 1 to k)
- Last color (c from 1 to m)

The initial state would be dp[0][0][*] = something, but probably the starting state is after processing 0 trees, 0 groups. Then for each step, we process the next tree and update the states.

Wait, let's see. For the first tree, it's either colored (fixed) or can be chosen. Then the number of groups becomes 1. So for i=1, j=1.

So the base case is that when we process the first tree, if it's colored, then j=1 and color is that. If it's uncolored, then for each possible color chosen, j=1 and cost is the paint for that color.

Then, for each subsequent tree (i from 2 to n), for each possible previous state (j_prev, c_prev), we check the current tree's possible color.

But the current tree's color is determined by whether it's pre-colored. So for each position i, if c_i is 0, we can choose any color (but need to pay the cost), else it's fixed and no cost.

So, the steps:

1. Precompute the cost for each tree and possible color. For trees with c_i !=0, their allowed color is fixed (so cost is 0 if chosen color is their own, else invalid). Wait, no: the problem says you can't color already colored trees. So for a tree with c_i !=0, its color is fixed. So when processing that tree, we have to take its color as given. So for such a tree, if in the DP step we are considering a color that's not c_i, that's invalid and can't be part of the solution.

So during the DP transitions, when processing tree i, if the tree is pre-colored (c_i !=0), then the color for that tree must be c_i, and the cost is 0. Otherwise, we can choose any color (from 1..m), and add the cost of p_i,j (where j is the chosen color).

Therefore, for each tree i, we can precompute the allowed color(s) and the cost associated with them.

So, for each tree i:

- if c_i !=0: allowed color is c_i, cost is 0.
- else: allowed colors are 1..m, cost is p_i,j for color j.

Now, the DP transitions:

For each position i from 1 to n:

For each possible previous state (j_prev, c_prev) where j_prev ranges from 1 to k, and c_prev is a color:

Then, when considering the current tree's allowed color (curr_color):

- if curr_color == c_prev: then the current group continues. So the new j is j_prev.
- else: the group count increases by 1, so j_new = j_prev + 1.

But the j_new must not exceed k.

So the transitions would be:

If current tree's color is same as previous group's color, then same group count. Else, group count increases by 1.

But we have to process each tree in order and track these possibilities.

The DP state is:

dp[i][j][c] = the minimum cost to reach up to tree i, with j groups, and last color c.

Initialize the DP with dp[0][0][c] for all c as infinity or something, except maybe for the initial state. Wait, for i=0 (no trees processed), j=0 groups, but this is before any trees.

But when processing the first tree (i=1), we have to start. So maybe the base case is when i=0, j=0. Then for each tree, we build from there.

Wait, for i=1, we can only have j=1. So for the first tree, the color is fixed (if pre-colored) or chosen (if 0), and j is 1.

So the initial state is:

After processing 0 trees (i=0), we have j=0 groups. The color here is undefined. But when processing the first tree, we transition from j=0 to j=1.

So for the first tree, the cost is the cost of its color (if allowed), and j=1.

Therefore, the initial DP is:

dp[0][0][any color] = 0? No, perhaps the initial state is that before processing any trees, there are 0 groups, and the next group starts. But that's not applicable.

Alternatively, the initial state is that for i=0, j=0, and the previous color is some dummy value (like 0), but perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, the DP starts with i=0, j=0, and then for each possible i, j, and color, we process the next tree.

But perhaps the correct approach is to initialize dp[0][0][c] as 0 for all c? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

For the first tree, the only possible group count is 1. So the first transition is from i=0, j=0 to i=1, j=1. For this, the color of the first tree is set to whatever it is (fixed or chosen). So the initial state for i=0, j=0 would be possible, and the first step would transition to j=1.

So the DP can be initialized as:

dp[0][0][0] = 0 (using a dummy color 0 for the initial state), and then for the first tree, we transition from j=0 to j=1, choosing the first color.

Alternatively, perhaps handling the first tree as a separate case.

But maybe it's easier to have a dummy state where after 0 trees, there are 0 groups, and the color is a special value (like 0). Then, for the first tree, when you choose its color (either fixed or chosen), you transition from j=0 to j=1, and the new color is the color of the first tree.

So the initial state is dp[0][0][0] = 0. Then for the first tree (i=1), the color can be determined (fixed if c_i !=0, else chosen from 1..m with cost). Then, for each possible color (allowed by the tree), the new state is i=1, j=1, color is that color. The cost is the cost of painting that color (if needed).

So the transitions are:

For each i from 1 to n:

   For each possible j from 1 to k:

      For each possible color c_prev in possible colors (for i-1):

          For the current tree (i), get the allowed colors (curr_colors). For each curr_color in curr_colors:

              if curr_color == c_prev:

                  new_j = j

              else:

                  new_j = j + 1

              if new_j > k: skip

              then, the cost is dp[i-1][j][c_prev] + cost_of_curr_color.

              Then, for the new state (i, new_j, curr_color), we take the minimum of the existing value and this new cost.

Wait, but the way the DP is structured, when processing the i-th tree, the j refers to the number of groups up to i.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to have dp[i][j][c] represent the minimum cost to color the first i trees, forming j groups, with the i-th tree's color being c.

So for the transitions:

When processing the (i+1)-th tree, which has color c_new (fixed or chosen), we check:

If the previous color (c_prev) is equal to c_new, then the group count j remains the same.

Otherwise, the group count increases by 1, so j_new = j_prev + 1.

But j_new can't exceed k.

So, the transitions would be:

For each possible state (i, j_prev, c_prev), and for the next tree's color c_new:

   if c_new == c_prev:

       new_j = j_prev

   else:

       new_j = j_prev + 1

   if new_j > k: skip

   Then, the cost is added, and the new state is (i+1, new_j, c_new). We update the dp for that state with the minimum value.

Now, considering that for each tree i, the color is fixed if c_i !=0. So for such a tree, we can only choose c_new = c_i (and cost is 0), else it's impossible. So when processing a tree that's already colored (c_i !=0), the allowed c_new is fixed, so the transitions for that tree are only considering that color.

For trees that are uncolored (c_i ==0), we can choose any color from 1..m, and add the cost p_i-1 (since input for p is 1-based in the problem? Wait, the problem's input says "the j-th number on the i-th of them line denotes pi,j â€” the amount of litres the friends need to color i-th tree with color j". So for the i-th tree, the line is pi,1 to pi,m. So for a 0-based index in code, we have to be careful. For example, in Python, the trees are 1-based in the input, but in code, perhaps 0-based.

So, the code would read n, m, k. Then the color array is c = list of integers (1-based input, but stored as 0-based in code?), then n lines follow. Each line has m integers, which are the p for that tree (1-based index). So in code, for tree i (0-based in code?), p[i][j] is the cost to color it with j+1? Or perhaps the input is 1-based for the trees. Let's see.

The input is:

The second line is n integers c1, c2, ..., cn. So these are the colors for trees 1 to n. Then, each of the next n lines corresponds to tree 1 to n. So the i-th line (after the c array) is for the i-th tree. Each line has m integers, which are the p_i,j for j=1 to m.

So in code, when we read the trees, for the 0-based index in the code, tree 0 in the code is tree 1 in the problem. So for example, the first line of p is for tree 0 in code. But the c array in code is zero-based, with c[0] being the color of the first tree in the problem.

So, when handling the trees, in code, for each tree in 0-based index i (from 0 to n-1), if c[i] is 0, then the allowed colors are 1..m, and the cost for choosing color j is p[i][j-1], since the j-th color in 1-based is j-1 in zero-based in the list.

So, for code:

c = list(map(int, input().split()))
p = []
for _ in range(n):
    p.append( list(map(int, input().split())) )

So for tree i (0-based), if c[i] ==0, possible colors are 1..m. So, for each possible color j (1 to m), cost is p[i][j-1]. If c[i] !=0, then allowed color is c[i], cost is 0.

Now, the DP needs to track for each tree i (0-based in code), the possible states (j groups, color c).

The maximum possible n is 100, k is up to 100, and m up to 100. So the DP state has size O(n * k * m) = 100 * 100 * 100 = 1e6. Which is acceptable for time constraints.

But the transitions would be O(n * k * m * m) in the worst case (for each tree, each possible j and color, and for each possible next color). For n=100, k=100, m=100, this is 100 * 100 * 100 * 100 = 1e8 operations. Which is a bit tight, but manageable, especially since Python is slower than C++, but for 1e8 operations, it's way too slow. Wait, no. 1e8 operations in Python would take about 10 seconds, which is way over the time limit. So this approach may not be feasible.

Wait, but maybe we can optimize the transitions. Let's see.

For each tree, for each possible (j, c_prev), and for each possible color of the current tree (c_curr), we compute the new j_new and update the DP.

But when the current tree is already colored, then c_curr is fixed. So for this case, we can process the transitions for c_curr only once, which reduces the m factor.

So for trees that are pre-colored, the transitions per tree are O(1) in terms of possible c_curr. For uncolored trees, it's O(m) possible c_curr.

So the total number of transitions would be:

For each tree i:

   if c[i] is fixed:

       possible c_curr is 1 (only the fixed color). So for each (j_prev, c_prev), the transition is to c_curr (fixed), and new j is j_prev or j_prev+1, based on color equality.

       So transitions per tree: O(k * m) possible previous states, multiplied by 1 possible c_curr. So O(k * m) per tree.

   else:

       possible c_curr is m. So transitions per tree: O(k * m) previous states multiplied by m possible c_curr. So O(k * m^2) per tree.

So for n trees:

Total transitions would be O(n * k * m^2) in the worst case (if all trees are uncolored). Which for n=100, k=100, m=100, gives 1e6 * 100 = 1e8 operations. That's 1e8 steps. Python can handle that, but perhaps with some optimizations.

Wait, 1e8 operations in Python can take around 10 seconds, but the time limit is 2 seconds. So this approach may be too slow.

Hmm. So perhaps we need to optimize further.

Alternative approach: when processing a tree that is uncolored, we can precompute the best possible transitions for each possible new color. For example, for each possible new color c_curr, for each possible previous j and c_prev, compute the best possible cost when transitioning to c_curr.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when handling transitions for the current tree's color, perhaps we can split into two cases: when the current color is the same as previous color (so j remains the same), or different (so j increases by 1). For each possible c_prev, we can track the minimum cost for each j and c_prev, and then for the current tree's color c_curr, we can compute the possible transitions.

Another optimization is to represent the DP as two layers: previous and current. So for each tree, we can have a 2D array (j, c) that represents the current state, and the previous state. This could save some memory, but the main issue is time.

Alternatively, for each tree, when the current tree's color is fixed (pre-colored), then the transitions can be done efficiently. For example, for each (j_prev, c_prev), we check if c_prev == c_curr (current tree's color). If yes, j_new is j_prev. Else, j_new is j_prev +1. Then, for each of these, if j_new <=k, we take the minimum cost between the existing value and (dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + cost).

In this case, the cost is zero if the tree is pre-colored. So for each pre-colored tree, the cost is zero. For uncolored trees, the cost is added based on the chosen color.

Wait, but for a pre-colored tree, the color is fixed. So when processing such a tree, the current color is fixed. So transitions are as follows:

Current color is c_curr (fixed). For each previous state (j_prev, c_prev):

   if c_prev == c_curr:

       j_new = j_prev

   else:

       j_new = j_prev +1

   if j_new exceeds k, skip.

   Then, the new state is (j_new, c_curr) with cost equal to the previous cost plus 0 (since pre-colored tree's color is fixed, no cost).

For uncolored trees, the current color can be any of m possibilities, each with their own cost. So for each possible c_curr (1..m), the transitions are:

For each previous state (j_prev, c_prev):

   if c_prev == c_curr:

       j_new = j_prev

   else:

       j_new = j_prev +1

   if j_new >k: skip.

   new cost is previous cost + p[i][c_curr-1] (since p is stored as a list of lists, with each entry for the i-th tree (0-based) and the j-th color (0-based, which is j+1 in the problem's terms).

So, the problem is that for uncolored trees, for each possible c_curr, we have to loop through all possible j_prev and c_prev. But with m possible c_curr, this could be O(k * m^2) per tree.

Hmm. Let's compute the worst case. For a tree that's uncolored, the transitions are:

For each c_curr in 1..m:

   for each j_prev in 1..k:

       for each c_prev in 1..m:

           check if c_prev == c_curr:

               j_new = j_prev

           else:

               j_new = j_prev +1

           if j_new <=k:

               update dp_new[j_new][c_curr] with min value.

But this is O(m) * O(k) * O(m) = O(k*m^2) per uncolored tree.

If all trees are uncolored, then for n=100, k=100, m=100, this is 100 * 100*100^2 = 1e8 operations, which is too slow for Python.

So, perhaps there's a smarter way to handle the transitions for uncolored trees.

Alternative idea: for each possible j_prev and c_prev, when the next color is chosen (for uncolored tree), what's the best possible way to choose the color to minimize the cost, given the transitions.

Wait, perhaps for each possible j_prev and c_prev, we can compute the minimum cost when choosing a color that is same as c_prev (so j remains j_prev), and the minimum cost when choosing a different color (so j increases by 1).

So for each j_prev and c_prev, we can find:

1. The minimum cost of choosing a color same as c_prev (if allowed) plus the cost for that color. This would contribute to j_prev in the next step.

2. The minimum cost of choosing a color different from c_prev, which would contribute to j_prev+1 in the next step.

But how to compute this efficiently?

For case 1 (same color as c_prev):

If the current tree is uncolored, then the color must be c_prev, but the cost is the cost of that color. So for this case, the cost added is p[i][c_prev-1], and the j remains the same.

But c_prev can be any possible color from the previous state.

Alternatively, for case 1, the new color is c_prev. So for each j_prev and c_prev, the new state is j_prev, c_prev, with cost dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + p[i][c_prev-1].

Wait, but if the tree is uncolored, then the allowed colors are all. So, for case 1, the color is same as previous, so the j remains same. So for each j_prev and c_prev, we can compute the cost of choosing c_prev again, and add that to the current state.

Then, for case 2 (different color), the color can be any color except c_prev. So for each j_prev and c_prev, we need to find the minimum cost among all possible colors != c_prev, and add the cost of that color. Then, the new j is j_prev +1.

But how to compute the minimum cost for different colors.

Wait, perhaps for case 1, the cost is the same as c_prev, and the cost is added. For case 2, the best possible choice is the color with the minimal cost among all colors except c_prev.

So, for each j_prev and c_prev:

   cost_same = p[i][c_prev-1] (if the tree is uncolored; if it's pre-colored, then this is zero, but only allowed if c_prev is the tree's color).

   Then, for the new state (j_prev, c_prev), the cost is dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_same.

   For case 2, we need to find the minimum cost among all colors c_curr != c_prev. So the cost_diff_min is min(p[i][c_curr-1] for c_curr != c_prev) and the minimal dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_diff_min. Then, the new state is (j_prev +1, c_curr), but the c_curr here is the one that gives the minimal cost.

Wait, but this approach may not work because the minimal cost_diff_min could vary depending on c_prev. For each j_prev and c_prev, the best choice for a different color is the minimal cost among colors not equal to c_prev.

So for each j_prev and c_prev:

   case 1: same color â†’ j_prev remains.

   case 2: different color â†’ j_prev +1.

So for case 1, the cost is the cost of c_prev (if allowed), added to the previous state. For case 2, the cost is the minimal cost of any color != c_prev (if allowed), plus the previous state's cost.

But how do we find the minimal cost for colors != c_prev?

Hmm. For a given tree i (uncolored), precompute the minimal cost for each color, and also precompute the minimal cost excluding each color.

For example, for tree i, compute min_cost_all = min(p[i][j] for j in 0..m-1) (since j is 0-based in code, corresponding to color 1..m).

Then, for each color c_prev, the minimal cost for colors != c_prev is min_cost = min(p[i][j] for j in 0..m-1 if (j+1) != c_prev). But this is O(m) per c_prev, which could be expensive.

Alternatively, precompute the two smallest costs and their colors. For example, find the two colors with the smallest costs. Then, for any color c_prev, the minimal cost for colors != c_prev is the minimal between the two, but excluding c_prev.

But how?

Suppose for tree i, the minimal cost is min1, achieved by color c1. The second minimal is min2, achieved by color c2. Then, for a color c_prev:

if c_prev is not c1, then the minimal cost for colors != c_prev is min1.

if c_prev is c1, then the minimal cost is min2.

This would work if the minimal for colors !=c_prev is either min1 (if c_prev is not the minimal color) or min2 (if c_prev is the minimal color).

So, for each uncolored tree, we can precompute the two minimal costs and their colors. Then, for any previous color c_prev, the minimal cost for a different color is either min1 (if c_prev's color is not the same as the minimal) or min2 (if it is).

This would allow us to compute case 2 in O(1) per c_prev, which would reduce the transition time.

So the steps are:

For each uncolored tree i:

   compute all m possible colors' costs (p[i][j]).

   find the two smallest costs and their corresponding colors.

   For each j_prev in 1..k:

       for each c_prev in 1..m:

           case 1: if current color is c_prev:

               new_j = j_prev

               new_cost = dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_same (p[i][c_prev-1])

               update dp_new[new_j][c_prev] with new_cost if it's better.

           case 2: choose a different color (c_curr not equal to c_prev):

               new_j = j_prev +1. If new_j >k, skip.

               if c_prev != c1:

                   min_diff_cost = min1

                   chosen_color = c1

               else:

                   min_diff_cost = min2

                   chosen_color = c2

               new_cost = dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + min_diff_cost

               update dp_new[new_j][chosen_color] with new_cost if it's better.

Wait, but in this approach, the chosen_color is either c1 or c2, depending on c_prev. But when you choose a different color, you can choose any color except c_prev. So the minimal cost would be the minimal of all colors except c_prev, which is either min1 or min2, as explained.

But this would not cover all possibilities. For example, if the minimal cost is c1, but c_prev is c3 (which is not c1), then the minimal cost for a different color would be min1 (c1). But if there's a color c4 that's cheaper than c1 but not considered in min1, then this approach would miss it.

Wait no, because min1 is the minimal of all colors. So if c_prev is not the minimal color (c1), then the minimal cost for colors not c_prev is min1 (since c1 is allowed). If c_prev is c1, then the minimal is min2.

So this approach works if we have the two smallest costs and their colors. For example:

Suppose the colors are 1,2,3,4. Their costs are 10, 5, 3, 20.

Then min1 is 3 (color 3), min2 is 5 (color 2).

If c_prev is color 1 (cost 10), then colors not c_prev are 2,3,4. The minimal is 3 (color 3).

If c_prev is color 3 (cost 3), then colors not c_prev are 1,2,4. The minimal is 5 (color 2).

So in this case, the approach would correctly select the minimal possible cost for a different color.

Thus, this approach would allow us to find the minimal possible cost for case 2 transitions (different color) in O(1) per c_prev.

So for each uncolored tree, we can precompute min1, c1, min2, c2. Then, for case 2 transitions:

   for each j_prev, c_prev:

       if c_prev != c1:

           cost_diff = min1, color is c1.

       else:

           cost_diff = min2, color is c2.

       new_j = j_prev +1.

       if new_j >k: skip.

       then, the new cost is dp_prev[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_diff.

       we compare this with the current value in dp_new[new_j][chosen_color] and take the minimum.

This reduces the transitions for case 2 from O(m) per c_prev to O(1). So for an uncolored tree, the transitions would be O(k * m) for case 1 (same color) and O(k * m) for case 2 (different color), leading to O(k * m) per tree. For all uncolored trees, this would be O(n * k * m), which for n=100, k=100, m=100 is 1e6 operations, which is manageable.

But wait, how does this work when there are multiple colors with the same minimal cost? For example, if two colors have the same min1, then when c_prev is not either of them, you can choose either. But the chosen color in this case would be one of them. However, since the problem requires the minimal total cost, the specific color chosen doesn't matter as long as the cost is minimal. So for the purpose of computing the minimal cost, it's sufficient to track the minimal cost and the corresponding color, even if there are multiple colors with the same cost.

But the actual color chosen will affect the next transitions, as the color becomes the new c_prev. So if two colors have the same minimal cost, but different colors, this approach would choose one of them (like the first encountered), which might not be optimal in future steps.

Hmm. This is a problem. Because the chosen color in case 2 transitions (different color) affects future transitions. For example, if you choose color A with cost x, and color B with the same cost x, but in the next step, color A allows for a lower cost transition than color B, then the approach would miss the optimal path.

So this optimization might not work correctly in all cases, because it selects the color based on the current step's cost, but not considering future steps. Therefore, this approach may not yield the correct minimal cost.

So this suggests that the original O(k * m^2) approach is necessary, but perhaps there's a way to optimize it.

Alternative idea: for each uncolored tree, precompute for each possible color the minimal cost to choose that color, and then for the transitions, process each color once.

But I don't see a way to avoid processing all possible colors for uncolored trees.

Another alternative is to note that the minimal cost for a group ending with color c is either:

- continuing the previous group (same color as previous), which requires that the previous group's color is c.

- starting a new group (different color than previous), which requires that the previous group's color is any color except c.

So for each current color c and group count j, the minimal cost can be computed as the minimum between:

1. the cost of continuing the previous group (same color) â†’ which is the previous group's cost for j-1 groups (if j is the same as previous j?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for each color c and j, the minimal cost is:

dp[i][j][c] = min(

   // case 1: same color as previous, so j remains the same

   dp[i-1][j][c] + cost_current_c,

   // case 2: different color from previous, so j increases by 1. We need to take the minimal of all dp[i-1][j-1][c_prev] for c_prev !=c.

   (min_over_c_prev !=c (dp[i-1][j-1][c_prev])) + cost_current_c

)

But in this approach, for each color c, and j, we can compute the minimal of case 1 and case 2.

But how to compute the minimal_over_c_prev !=c (dp[i-1][j-1][c_prev]) efficiently.

If we can precompute for each j-1 the minimal value among all colors except c, then this would allow us to compute case 2 in O(1) per color.

For example, for each j, compute the minimal value in dp[i-1][j][*], and also track the second minimal and the color that achieves the minimal. Then, for a given c, if the minimal for j-1 is achieved by a color different than c, then case 2 is that minimal. Otherwise, case 2 is the second minimal.

So the steps would be:

For each j in 1..k:

   compute the minimal value and the color that achieved it for dp_prev[j][*].

   also compute the second minimal.

Then, for case 2 transitions, when adding a new color c:

   if the minimal color for j_prev-1 is not c, then the minimal value is the minimal value.

   else, it's the second minimal.

This would allow case 2 transitions to be computed in O(1) per color.

But wait, this is for a different problem setup. Let's re-express the transitions.

The DP for each tree and each j and color c:

dp[i][j][c] = min(

   // case 1: previous color is c, so same group.

   dp[i-1][j][c] + cost_current_c,

   // case 2: previous color is not c, new group.

   (min_prev_val) + cost_current_c

)

where min_prev_val is the minimal value of dp[i-1][j-1][c_prev] for c_prev !=c.

So, for each j and c, we need to find the minimal value of dp_prev[j-1][c_prev] where c_prev !=c.

If we precompute for each j-1 the global minimal (over all c_prev) and the minimal that excludes each c, then we can get this value quickly.

But precomputing for each j-1 and c, the minimal of dp_prev[j-1][c_prev] where c_prev !=c is O(m^2) per j, which would be O(k * m^2) per tree. But since k is 100 and m is 100, this is 1e4 * 1e4 = 1e8 operations, which is again not feasible.

Alternative idea: for each j, compute the global minimal and the color that achieved it. For each j, also compute the second minimal. Then, for a given c:

   if the global minimal's color is not c, then min_prev_val is the global minimal.

   else, it's the second minimal.

This way, for each j and c, min_prev_val is either the global minimal or the second minimal.

But this is only correct if there exists at least two colors with different minimal values. For example, if all colors except c have a higher value than the global minimal, then if the global minimal's color is c, the next best is the second minimal, which could be another color. But this approach would work if the second minimal is indeed the minimal when the global minimal's color is c.

But this approach is not correct in all cases. For example, suppose for j-1, the minimal values are as follows:

colors 1, 2, 3 have values 10, 5, 5. Then the global minimal is 5 (colors 2 and 3). For a current color c=2, the minimal_prev_val is min(10,5) for colors 1 and 3, which is 5. But according to the approach, if the global minimal's color is 2, but it's actually color 2 and 3. So the approach would compute the second minimal as 5 (color 3), which is correct.

But if the global minimal's color is 2, and the second minimal is 5 (color 3), then for c=2, the minimal_prev_val is 5 (color 3's value). Which is correct.

So, this approach can work if for each j, we track the global minimal and the second minimal (which could be the same as the global minimal if multiple colors have the same value).

So for each j, during the previous step, we can compute:

   min1_val: the minimal value in dp_prev[j][*]

   min1_colors: list of colors that achieve min1_val.

   min2_val: the next minimal value.

Then, for any current color c:

   if c is not in min1_colors, then min_prev_val is min1_val.

   else:

       if there are other colors in min1_colors (i.e., other colors also have min1_val), then min_prev_val is min1_val.

       else, min_prev_val is min2_val.

So this would correctly find the minimal of dp_prev[j-1][c_prev] for c_prev !=c.

But this requires more complex bookkeeping.

Alternatively, for each j, compute the minimal value of dp_prev[j][c_prev] for all c_prev, and the minimal value excluding each color c. But that's O(m) per j.

Hmm. Let's think about how to compute this efficiently.

For each j, compute the global_min as the minimal of dp_prev[j][c_prev] for all c_prev.

Also, for each j, compute an array where for each color c, we store the minimal of dp_prev[j][c_prev] where c_prev !=c. Let's call this array exclude_min[j][c].

To compute exclude_min[j][c], it's the minimal value among all colors except c. How to compute this efficiently.

An efficient way is to find for each j:

- the global_min and the second_min, along with their colors.

But this only works if the exclude_min[j][c] is:

   if c is the color of global_min:

       exclude_min[j][c] = second_min

   else:

       exclude_min[j][c] = global_min

But this is only valid if the second_min is the minimal value among all colors except the global_min's color.

But if the global_min is achieved by multiple colors, then excluding any of them would still leave other colors with global_min.

For example, if global_min is 5 and achieved by colors 2 and 3. Then, for c=2, exclude_min[j][2] is 5 (from color 3), and for c=3, exclude_min[j][3] is 5 (from color 2). So in this case, even if the second_min is higher than global_min, the exclude_min is still global_min.

So in this case, the approach of tracking global_min and second_min would fail, because the actual exclude_min for colors 2 and 3 would be 5 (the same as global_min), but the second_min might be higher.

So this suggests that the approach of tracking global_min and second_min is not sufficient.

Thus, the correct way to compute exclude_min[j][c] is to compute the minimal value of dp_prev[j][c_prev] where c_prev !=c. To compute this for all c, we can use the following method:

For each j:

   Compute a list of all dp_prev[j][c_prev] for c_prev in 1..m.

   For each c in 1..m:

       exclude_min[j][c] = min of the list excluding the element at c.

But this is O(m^2) per j, which is O(k * m^2) per tree. For k=100 and m=100, this is 1e4 * 1e4 = 1e8 operations per tree, which is again not feasible.

So perhaps this optimization is not viable.

Alternative idea: for each j, compute the global_min and the count of how many colors achieve this global_min. Then, for a given c:

   if the global_min is achieved by colors other than c, then exclude_min[j][c] is global_min.

   else:

       if there are multiple colors achieving global_min (including c), then exclude_min[j][c] is global_min.

       else, exclude_min[j][c] is the second_min.

But how to track this?

For example, if the global_min is 5, and it's achieved by colors 2,3, then for any c not in 2 or 3, exclude_min[j][c] is 5. For c=2 or 3, exclude_min[j][c] is 5 (since there are other colors with the same min). But if the global_min is achieved by only color 2, then exclude_min[j][c=2] is the second_min.

So, for each j:

   Compute global_min and the set of colors that achieve it.

   Compute the second_min.

Then, for each c:

   if c is not in the global_min colors:

       exclude_min[j][c] = global_min

   else:

       if len(global_min_colors) >1:

           exclude_min[j][c] = global_min

       else:

           exclude_min[j][c] = second_min

This way, the exclude_min can be computed in O(m) per j, as long as we have the global_min, the global_min_colors, and the second_min.

This requires storing for each j:

- global_min_val

- global_min_colors (set)

- second_min_val

So during processing of each j, we can find these values.

This would allow us to compute exclude_min[j][c] in O(1) per c.

But how to compute global_min, global_min_colors, and second_min_val for each j?

Yes. For each j, iterate through all colors and collect all dp_prev[j][c] values, then find the global_min and second_min.

But this is O(m) per j, which is O(k * m) per tree. For k=100 and m=100, that's 1e4 per tree.

This is manageable.

So, the steps for an uncolored tree would be:

For each j_prev in 0..k:

   compute global_min_prev[j_prev], global_min_colors_prev[j_prev], second_min_prev[j_prev].

Then, for each color c_curr (1..m):

   for each j_prev in 0..k:

       case 1: same color as previous.

           if j_prev >=1:

               cost_same = dp_prev[j_prev][c_curr] + p[i][c_curr-1]

               if j_prev <=k:

                   update dp_current[j_prev][c_curr] = min( current value, cost_same )

       case 2: different color from previous â†’ j_new = j_prev +1.

           if j_prev +1 >k: continue.

           if j_prev ==0: then this case is not possible. Because j_prev is 0 (no groups yet), and we are adding the first tree. So case 2 would require j_prev=0 â†’ j_new=1, which is allowed.

           exclude_min = compute exclude_min_prev[j_prev][c_curr]

           cost_diff = exclude_min + p[i][c_curr-1]

           update dp_current[j_prev+1][c_curr] = min( current value, cost_diff )

Wait, but j_prev is the number of groups before processing this tree. For case 2, the new group count is j_prev +1.

But for the first tree (i=1), j_prev can be 0. Then, case 2 would be j_prev +1 =1.

So for the first tree, case 1 is when j_prev=0, but the previous color is not available. So case 1 is not applicable, and case 2 is the only option. But this depends on how the DP is structured.

Hmm. This suggests that the approach is getting too complex.

Maybe it's better to proceed with the original O(k * m^2) approach for uncolored trees and see if it can pass in Python with optimizations.

So, the plan is:

Initialize a 3D DP array, but since n is up to 100 and k up to 100, and m up to 100, using a 3D array may be memory-intensive. But in Python, using a list of lists of lists should be manageable.

But for each step, we can use two 2D arrays: previous and current.

The previous array holds the state for i-1, and the current array for i.

For each tree i:

   if the tree is pre-colored:

       c_curr = c[i]

       cost_curr = 0

       for each j_prev in 0..k:

           for each c_prev in 0..m (if allowed):

               if j_prev is 0 (initial state):

                   if i is 0: then j_new =1, but the initial state is j=0.

                   wait, perhaps the initial state is j=0, c_prev=0 (dummy color) for i=0.

                   So for the first tree (i=0 in code?), j_prev=0, c_prev=0.

                   then, j_new =1 (since color changes from dummy to c_curr).

                   cost is 0 if the tree is pre-colored.

                   So for i=0, j_new=1, c_curr is fixed.

       Or perhaps:

       For the current tree's color c_curr (fixed), iterate over all possible j_prev and c_prev in previous state.

       For each (j_prev, c_prev) in previous:

           if c_prev == c_curr:

               j_new = j_prev

           else:

               j_new = j_prev +1

           if j_new >k: skip.

           cost_new = previous[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_curr.

           update current[j_new][c_curr] with min(current[j_new][c_curr], cost_new)

   else:

       for each possible color c_curr (1..m):

           cost_curr = p[i][c_curr-1]

           for each (j_prev, c_prev) in previous:

               if c_prev == c_curr:

                   j_new = j_prev

               else:

                   j_new = j_prev +1

               if j_new >k: continue

               cost_new = previous[j_prev][c_prev] + cost_curr

               if cost_new < current[j_new][c_curr]:

                   current[j_new][c_curr] = cost_new

So, for uncolored trees, this would loop over all possible previous states (j_prev, c_prev) and all possible c_curr (1..m), leading to O(k * m^2) operations per tree.

But for n=100, k=100, m=100, this is 100 * 100 * 100^2 = 1e8 operations. Which is likely too slow for Python.

But perhaps we can optimize by using a more efficient data structure, like dictionaries or using numpy arrays. But in Python, using lists and nested loops with integer indices is likely the fastest.

Alternatively, we can represent the DP tables as lists of lists, where each entry is initialized to a large value (inf), and we update them in-place.

In Python, for each step, the current DP is initialized to infinity, and for each possible transition, we compute the new state and update the current DP if the new cost is lower.

But for 1e8 operations, even in C++ this would be tight for a 2-second time limit. Python is much slower. So this approach may not be feasible.

Alternative approach: if the tree is uncolored, and there are m possible colors, but the problem asks for the minimal cost, perhaps for each j and c_curr, we can find the minimal cost by considering the best possible previous j_prev and c_prev.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: precompute for each tree the allowed colors and their costs. For each tree i:

   allowed_colors = [c[i]] if c[i] !=0 else list(range(1, m+1)).

Then, for each tree i:

   for each allowed_color in allowed_colors:

       cost = 0 if c[i] !=0 else p[i][allowed_color-1]

       for each possible j_prev in 0..k:

           for each possible c_prev in allowed_colors of previous step:

               compute j_new and update.

But this doesn't reduce the number of operations.

Hmm.

Maybe the problem is manageable if we use the initial approach, but represent the DP tables as lists of lists, and minimize the number of operations.

Let me try to outline the code.

First, read the input:

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

c = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

Then, for each tree, we process it and update the DP.

Initialize the DP:

prev_dp is a 2D array where prev_dp[j][c] is the minimal cost to have j groups and last color c after processing i trees.

Initially, for i=0, we have processed 0 trees. So prev_dp is initialized with:

prev_dp = [[inf] * (m+1) for _ in range(k+1)]

prev_dp[0][0] = 0  # dummy state for j=0, color 0.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is after processing 0 trees, we have 0 groups, and the color is a dummy value (0). Then, for the first tree, we can transition from j=0 to j=1, and set the color to the first tree's color.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is j=0, and color is 0 (dummy), and cost is 0.

Then, for each tree i in 0-based:

   current_dp = [[inf] * (m+1) for _ in range(k+1)]

   if c[i] ==0:

       # uncolored, can choose any color with cost p[i][j]

       allowed_colors = range(1, m+1)

       for j_prev in range(k+1):

           for c_prev in range(m+1):

               if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] == inf:

                   continue

               for c_curr in allowed_colors:

                   cost = p[i][c_curr-1]

                   if c_curr == c_prev:

                       j_new = j_prev

                   else:

                       j_new = j_prev + 1

                   if j_new >k:

                       continue

                   if current_dp[j_new][c_curr] > prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost:

                       current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost

   else:

       # colored, color is fixed to c[i]

       c_curr = c[i]

       cost = 0

       for j_prev in range(k+1):

           for c_prev in range(m+1):

               if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] == inf:

                   continue

               if c_curr == c_prev:

                   j_new = j_prev

               else:

                   j_new = j_prev +1

               if j_new >k:

                   continue

               if current_dp[j_new][c_curr] > prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost:

                   current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost

   prev_dp = current_dp

At the end, the answer is the minimal value in prev_dp[k][c] for c in 1..m. If none are <inf, output -1.

But for m=100 and k=100, and n=100, this code would run 100 * 100 * 100 * 100 = 1e8 operations for uncolored trees, which is too slow for Python.

But perhaps we can optimize the code by precomputing allowed_colors and looping through them only once.

Another optimization is to precompute for each tree whether it's colored or not, and process them accordingly.

But even with that, the code is likely to be too slow for the worst cases.

Alternative idea: use numpy arrays for the DP states, which can speed up the operations. But in Python, this may not be straightforward and could require a lot of memory.

Alternatively, note that for pre-colored trees, the transitions are O(k*m) per tree, which is manageable. For uncolored trees, the transitions are O(k*m*m), but perhaps with some early pruning, like breaking loops when prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] is infinity.

But in Python, nested loops are generally slow. So perhaps we can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where for each j_prev, we track the possible c_prev and their costs, but this may not help.

Another optimization is to represent the DP tables as lists of lists, and for each j_prev, track the minimum cost for each color c_prev, and use that to prune the transitions.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for uncolored trees, for each j_prev and c_prev, we can precompute the best possible color choices.

But I'm not seeing a way.

So perhaps the only way to make this code pass in Python is to find a way to reduce the number of operations for uncolored trees.

Wait, perhaps for uncolored trees, we can precompute for each j_prev and c_prev, the best possible c_curr that minimizes the cost. But this requires knowledge of the previous state.

Alternatively, for each j_prev, we can find the minimal cost for each c_prev, and then for each c_curr, compute the cost for case 1 and case 2.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, for each j_prev, we can track the minimal cost for all c_prev, and use that to compute the case 2 transitions.

For example:

For case 1 (same color as c_prev), for each j_prev and c_prev, we need to consider c_curr = c_prev.

For case 2 (different color), the minimal cost would be the minimal cost of all c_prev != c_curr.

But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, for each j_prev, we can track the minimal cost of all c_prev, and then for case 2 transitions, we can compute:

cost_case2 = min_prev_cost + cost_curr, where min_prev_cost is the minimal cost in j_prev-1.

But this would work if case 2 transitions are allowed to start a new group, which requires j_prev to be j_new-1.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to precompute for each j_prev and c_prev, and for each possible c_curr, the j_new and cost.

But this doesn't reduce the number of operations.

In the sample inputs, the first case has all trees uncolored. Let's see how the code would handle it.

Sample input 1:

3 2 2

0 0 0

1 2

3 4

5 6

So the trees are uncolored. For each tree, the code would loop over all possible c_prev, j_prev, and c_curr.

For the first tree (i=0), allowed_colors are 1 and 2.

The initial prev_dp is j=0, color 0, cost 0.

For each c_prev in 0:

   for j_prev=0:

       for c_curr in 1 and 2:

           since c_prev is 0 (dummy), c_curr !=c_prev, so j_new = j_prev +1 =1.

           cost is 0 + p[0][c_curr-1] = for c_curr=1, 1; for c_curr=2, 2.

So after first tree, current_dp has j=1, colors 1 and 2, costs 1 and 2.

For the second tree (i=1), uncolored. For each j_prev in 0..k (which is 0 and 1), and c_prev in 0..m (0,1,2). But prev_dp is after first tree, which is j_prev can be 1, and c_prev can be 1 or 2.

For each j_prev (1), c_prev (1 or 2):

   for each c_curr in 1,2:

       if c_curr == c_prev:

           j_new =1.

           cost = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + p[1][c_curr-1].

       else:

           j_new = 2.

           cost = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + p[1][c_curr-1].

So for c_prev=1:

   c_curr=1 â†’ j_new=1, cost 1+3=4.

   c_curr=2 â†’ j_new=2, cost 1+4=5.

For c_prev=2:

   c_curr=2 â†’ j_new=1, cost 2+4=6.

   c_curr=1 â†’ j_new=2, cost 2+3=5.

So after second tree, possible states:

j=1, c=1: cost 4.

j=1, c=2: cost 6.

j=2, c=2: cost5.

j=2, c=1: cost5.

Then, for third tree (i=2), uncolored.

We need to reach j=2.

For each possible state from the second tree.

For example, if j_prev=1 and c_prev=1:

   c_curr can be 1 or 2.

   if c_curr=1:

       j_new=1 â†’ which is j=1. Since we need j=2, this is not considered.

   if c_curr=2:

       j_new=2 â†’ allowed. cost is 4 +6=10.

Similarly, other transitions.

So the code would find the minimum cost of 10.

But how to implement this in Python efficiently.

In code, for each uncolored tree, the nested loops are:

for j_prev in range(k+1):

   for c_prev in range(m+1):

       if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] is inf:

           continue

       for c_curr in allowed_colors:

           compute j_new.

           update current_dp[j_new][c_curr].

This is O(k * m * m) per tree.

But in Python, even with m=100, k=100, and n=100, this is 100 * 100 * 100 * 100 = 1e8 operations. Which is likely to be too slow.

So perhaps there's no way around this, and the problem requires an O(k*m^2) solution, which is possible only if the code is optimized as much as possible.

Some optimizations to consider:

1. Represent the DP tables as lists of lists of integers, initialized with a large value (like INF = 1e18).

2. For each tree, when processing, first determine if it's colored or uncolored.

3. For colored trees, processing is O(k*m) per tree.

4. For uncolored trees, processing is O(k*m^2) per tree.

But to make this code as efficient as possible in Python, we can try to minimize the number of loops and operations inside them.

For example, for uncolored trees:

allowed_colors = range(1, m+1)

for j_prev in range(k+1):

    for c_prev in range(m+1):

        if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] == INF:

            continue

        for c_curr in allowed_colors:

            # compute j_new

            if c_prev == c_curr:

                j_new = j_prev

            else:

                j_new = j_prev + 1

            if j_new > k:

                continue

            # compute cost

            cost = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + p[i][c_curr - 1]

            if cost < current_dp[j_new][c_curr]:

                current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = cost

But in Python, loops are slow. So perhaps using a precomputed list of allowed_colors and other optimizations can help.

Another optimization is to precompute the p_i for each uncolored tree. For example, for uncolored tree i, create a list of tuples (c_curr, cost) where c_curr is in 1..m and cost is p[i][c_curr-1].

But this is not going to significantly reduce the time.

Alternatively, for uncolored trees, precompute the allowed_colors once and iterate over them.

But the main problem is the nested loops.

Another idea: since in Python, list comprehensions and generator expressions are faster than nested loops, perhaps rewrite the code to use them. But this may not be feasible.

Alternatively, use a more optimized data structure for current_dp. For example, using a list of dictionaries where each entry is a dictionary mapping colors to costs for each j. But this may not be faster.

Alternatively, precompute all possible transitions and use bitmasking. But I don't see a way.

In the end, the code may have to be written as per the initial approach, and hope that the problem's constraints are not tight enough to TLE in Python.

So, the final code would be as follows:

Read the input, initialize the DP with a dummy state, and process each tree, updating the DP as per whether the tree is colored or uncolored.

Finally, find the minimal cost among the j=k states.

The code:

Read n, m, k.

Read c array.

Read p array.

Initialize prev_dp as a 2D list of INF, except prev_dp[0][0] =0.

For each i in 0 to n-1:

    current_dp is initialized to INF for all j and c.

    if c[i] !=0:

        c_curr = c[i]

        cost =0

        for j_prev in 0 to k:

            for c_prev in 0 to m:

                if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] == INF:

                    continue

                if c_prev == c_curr:

                    j_new = j_prev

                else:

                    j_new = j_prev +1

                if j_new >k:

                    continue

                if current_dp[j_new][c_curr] > prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost:

                    current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost

    else:

        for j_prev in 0 to k:

            for c_prev in 0 to m:

                if prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] == INF:

                    continue

                for c_curr in 1 to m:

                    cost = p[i][c_curr-1]

                    if c_prev == c_curr:

                        j_new = j_prev

                    else:

                        j_new = j_prev +1

                    if j_new >k:

                        continue

                    if current_dp[j_new][c_curr] > prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost:

                        current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = prev_dp[j_prev][c_prev] + cost

    prev_dp = current_dp

Finally, check the minimal value in prev_dp[k][1..m]. If it's INF, output -1, else output it.

But the code is missing the initial state for j=0, color 0, and the first tree's transitions.

But according to the code, for the first tree (i=0), which is uncolored:

prev_dp starts with j=0, color 0 (dummy), cost 0.

For each c_prev=0 (dummy), j_prev=0:

   for each c_curr in 1..m:

       j_new = j_prev +1 (since c_prev != c_curr)

       cost = p[0][c_curr-1]

       current_dp[j_new][c_curr] = cost.

Which is correct.

So the code should work.
