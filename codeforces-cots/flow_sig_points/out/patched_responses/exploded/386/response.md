Okay, let's see. The problem is to replace all the question marks in the string s such that the number of occurrences of t in the new string is maximized. Hmm. So, the main challenge is to figure out how to replace the '?'s optimally to create as many instances of t as possible, possibly with overlapping.

First, I need to understand how to count occurrences. Since occurrences can overlap, even a single character can be part of multiple matches. For example, if t is "ababa", then in the string "abababa", there are two occurrences starting at positions 0 and 2.

But how do we model this? The naive approach of checking every possible position for t after replacing '?'s is going to be too slow, especially considering the constraints where |s| and |t| can be up to 1e5, but their product is up to 1e7, which suggests that O(|s|*|t|) algorithms are acceptable.

Wait, the product is allowed up to 1e7. So maybe the intended solution has that complexity.

Let's think. The approach would be to find a way to replace '?'s so that as many positions in s as possible can be part of a match of t. But since replacing a '?' affects all possible overlapping occurrences, we need a way to model which choices maximize the count.

Let me think of dynamic programming. Maybe we can track the maximum number of occurrences up to each position in s, considering the possible states of the current partial match of t.

Alternatively, perhaps using the KMP algorithm's failure function to track the current state of the partial match. That way, for each position in s, we can track the maximum number of occurrences possible up to that point, given the possible states of the automaton.

But how to integrate the '?' characters which can be any letter. For each '?', we can choose a letter that allows the best possible continuation towards forming t's occurrences.

So here's an outline:

1. Precompute the KMP failure function (partial match table) for the pattern t. This will help in determining the next state in the automaton when processing each character.

2. Use dynamic programming where each state represents the current position in the KMP automaton (the length of the longest prefix of t that matches the current suffix). For each position i in s and state j in KMP, we track the maximum number of occurrences of t that can be achieved up to i, given that after processing i, the automaton is in state j.

3. For each position in s, and each possible state in the KMP automaton, consider all possible transitions. If the current character in s is a '?', we need to try all possible characters (but this seems expensive unless optimized).

Wait, but trying all 26 letters for each '?' might not be feasible. However, given that |s|*|t| is up to 1e7, and for each step, we have |t| possible states, and for each state, perhaps considering all possible transitions (for each possible character), but with some optimizations.

But perhaps, for each state j, and for each possible next character c (if the current s[i] is '?'), we can compute the next state in the automaton, and update the DP accordingly.

Alternatively, for each position in s, and for each possible state in the KMP automaton (from 0 to len(t)), we compute the maximum number of occurrences possible up to that point, and the transitions based on the current character (fixed or variable if '?').

So, here's a more detailed plan:

- Precompute the KMP automaton transitions for t. That is, for each state j (0 to len(t)-1), and each character c in 'a' to 'z', what is the next state when we read c after state j. This is O(26*|t|) time and space.

- Then, use dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of occurrences of t achievable up to the i-th character of s, ending in state j of the KMP automaton. The initial state is dp[0][0] = 0. All others are -infinity or something.

- For each i from 0 to len(s)-1, and for each possible state j, if dp[i][j] is not feasible (i.e., not the maximum), skip. Then, for the current character s[i], if it's a '?', we need to try all possible 26 letters. For each possible c, compute the next state j' by following the KMP transitions from j with c. Then, if j' reaches len(t), then adding 1 occurrence (since we completed a full match), and then the next state is the failure state (since after a match, the automaton can restart from the failure function's value). Otherwise, the next state is j'.

Wait, KMP automaton works as follows: when you are in state j (which is the length of the current match), and you read a character c. The next state is the longest possible prefix of t that is a suffix of the current string plus c. For example, if the current state is j, and adding c gives a match of length j', then j' is the next state. If j' equals len(t), then a full match is found. However, even when a match is found, the automaton can still process the next characters for overlapping matches.

So, the transitions are:

If current state is j, next character is c:

- Compute j' = the next state after adding c. This can be computed by the KMP automaton's transition function.

But to compute this, the KMP failure function (also known as the partial match table) is used.

Alternatively, the transition for j and c is:

We start with j, and check if t[j] == c. If yes, then j' = j+1. If no, we backtrack using the failure function until we find a k where t[k] == c, and then j' = k+1. If no such k exists, j' = 0.

But precomputing all possible transitions for j and c would make this O(1) per transition.

So, precompute a 2D array next_state where next_state[j][c] gives the next state when in state j and character c is read.

Once this is precomputed, for each character in s (fixed or variable if '?'), we can compute possible transitions.

So, the dynamic programming approach would be:

Initialize a DP array where for each position i in s, and each possible state j (0 <= j < len(t)), we track the maximum number of occurrences possible up to i, ending in state j.

For each i, and each j, if the current character is fixed (not '?'), then the next possible characters are only that character. So, for each possible j, we compute the next state j' based on the fixed character. Then, if j' equals len(t), we add 1 to the occurrence count. Otherwise, the count remains the same.

If the current character is '?', then we can choose any character c (a-z) to maximize the occurrence count. For each possible c, compute the next state j', and take the maximum possible count.

The key here is to model the DP transitions correctly, considering that choosing a particular c for a '?' can lead to different states and occurrence counts.

But how do we manage the transitions efficiently?

Let's formalize this.

Let len_t = len(t), len_s = len(s).

The DP will be a 2D array (or two 1D arrays for space optimization) where dp[j] represents the maximum number of occurrences achievable when in state j after processing the first i characters.

We start with dp[0] = 0 (no occurrences) and all other states as -infinity.

Then, for each character in s:

- For each possible state j in the current DP, and for each possible character c (if current char is '?') or the fixed c, compute the next state j' and the new count (current count plus 1 if j' == len_t).

So, for the transition:

When processing character c (either fixed or chosen for '?'), from state j:

next_j = next_state[j][c]

count_increase = 0

if next_j == len_t:

    count_increase = 1

    # After a full match, the automaton can reset to the failure state of len_t (but since the failure function for len_t is not part of the original KMP, perhaps we need to compute it as well).

    # Wait, in the KMP automaton, once you reach len_t, the failure function would take you to the failure value of len_t. Wait, the failure function for the KMP is usually defined for 0 <= j <= len_t-1. So when you reach len_t, that's a full match, and then the next state would be the failure function of len_t (which is the same as the failure function of len_t-1 plus one, but perhaps we need to precompute the failure function for len_t as well).

Wait, perhaps we need to precompute the failure function for all positions up to len_t. Let's clarify.

In KMP, the failure function (partial match table) is computed for the pattern t. For each position j in t (from 0 to len_t-1), the failure function, fail[j], is the length of the longest proper prefix of t[0..j] which is also a suffix. For example, for j=0, fail[j] is 0.

When processing a character that allows us to reach len_t (a full match), the next state would be the failure function of len_t. So perhaps when we reach state len_t, the next state is fail[len_t], but how is that computed?

Alternatively, after a full match, the automaton should backtrack to the failure function of len_t-1. Let's think of the standard KMP: when a match is found, the automaton can continue processing by treating the next state as fail[len_t-1], but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the KMP automaton is designed such that after a full match (state len_t), the next state is determined by the failure function. However, the failure function is usually only defined for states up to len_t-1. So, perhaps in practice, when a full match occurs (j = len_t), the next state is the failure function of len_t-1. For example, in the standard KMP implementation, when you reach j = len_t, you can consider that as a match, and then reset j to fail[j-1], and continue.

So, perhaps for our purposes, whenever we reach state len_t (the full match), the next state is the failure value of len_t-1. Therefore, when we process a character that takes us to len_t, the next state after processing that character is fail[len_t-1], and the occurrence count is incremented by 1.

Therefore, in our DP transitions:

When processing character c, from state j:

current_count = dp_prev[j]

next_j = next_state[j][c]

if next_j == len_t:

    count_increase = 1

    new_state = next_state[j][c]

    # but then, after the match, the next state is the failure function of new_state (which is len_t - 1's failure)

    # Wait, perhaps next_j is len_t, but in our next_state transitions, we have to handle this.

Wait, perhaps the next_state array includes transitions for all states up to len_t. So, perhaps for the states up to len_t, including len_t itself. So when j is len_t, the next character c would transition to next_state[len_t][c].

But that's not part of the original KMP. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after a full match (j = len_t), the next state is computed as the failure of len_t. So we need to compute the failure function for len_t as well.

But how to compute the failure function for j = len_t?

Wait, the failure function is computed for the pattern t. The standard KMP algorithm computes the failure array up to index len_t-1. To compute the failure for len_t, perhaps we can extend the logic.

The failure function for j is the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. For j = len_t, the entire string is considered, but the longest proper prefix would be the failure for j = len_t-1, which is fail[len_t-1], but then we check if t[fail[len_t-1]] == c (the next character). Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, when a full match is found (j = len_t), we can treat the next state as the failure of len_t-1. Because in KMP, after a full match at position i, you set j = fail[j], which for j = len_t would be j = fail[len_t-1], allowing overlapping matches.

Wait, maybe the KMP automaton is designed so that when you reach j = len_t, you process the next character as follows: after a match, you set j = fail[j-1], then check if the current character matches t[j]. So, in our next_state transitions, when j is len_t, we first compute j' = fail[j-1], then proceed as usual.

But how do we model this in the transitions? Maybe the next_state array only includes transitions for j up to len_t-1, and when j reaches len_t, we have to handle it as a special case.

Alternatively, perhaps the next_state array includes transitions for j up to len_t. Let's adjust the code for building the next_state.

Wait, when building the next_state array for KMP, the standard approach is to precompute for each state j (0 <= j <= len_t) and each character c, the next state.

But the standard KMP failure function is built for j from 1 to len_t-1. So perhaps, to handle transitions after a full match (j = len_t), we need to compute the failure function for j = len_t.

Let me think. Let's consider that when j is len_t (the full match), the failure function for j is the same as the failure function for j-1 (len_t-1). Because the failure function for j represents the longest prefix that is also a suffix of the string up to j. But since j is len_t, the entire string, which has no proper prefix, so the failure function is 0? Or perhaps the failure function for len_t is the same as for len_t-1.

Alternatively, perhaps after a full match, the next state is the failure function of len_t-1. For example, after a full match at position i, the next state is fail[len_t-1], and then process the next character.

So, the next_state array for j = len_t would be computed as follows:

For each character c, next_state[len_t][c] is the same as next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

So, when building the next_state array, after building for all j up to len_t-1, we can compute the transitions for j = len_t by using the failure function of j-1.

This way, when a full match is found (j = len_t), the next character will transition based on the failure function of j-1, allowing overlapping matches.

So, in code:

Compute the failure function for t, up to j = len_t-1.

Then, compute the next_state for j = len_t as follows:

for each c in 'a' to 'z':

    next_state[len_t][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c]

Thus, in the DP transitions, whenever j is len_t, we use this next_state.

But this is getting a bit complex. Let me proceed step by step.

First, precompute the failure function and the next_state transitions for all j from 0 to len_t.

Wait, perhaps the standard KMP approach can be extended to compute next_state for j up to len_t. Let's see.

The next_state for j and c is the maximum possible length of a prefix of t that matches a suffix of the current string after adding c.

So, for j < len_t, if t[j] == c, then next_state is j+1. Otherwise, we backtrack using the failure function until we find a k where t[k] == c, and next_state is k+1. If none, then 0.

But for j = len_t, which is the state after a full match, the next_state is computed based on the failure function of len_t-1.

Wait, after a full match (j = len_t), the next character c would be processed by the failure function of len_t-1, so the next_state for j = len_t and c is:

k = fail[len_t-1]

while k > 0 and t[k] != c:

    k = fail[k-1]

if t[k] == c:

    k +=1

so next_state[len_t][c] = k

But this is the same as next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c], which is how the next_state is computed for j = len_t-1.

Wait, perhaps the failure function for j = len_t is the same as the failure function for j = len_t-1. Because the failure function for j = len_t would be the length of the longest proper prefix of t that is a suffix of t. Which is the same as the failure function for j = len_t-1.

No, wait, the failure function for j is defined for the substring t[0..j-1]. So when j is len_t, which is the entire string, the failure function is the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix. For example, for "abab", the failure function for j=4 (len_t=4) would be 2, since "ab" is both prefix and suffix.

But in standard KMP, the failure array is computed for j up to len_t-1. So j represents the length of the current match. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the KMP algorithm.

In KMP, the failure function for the pattern t is an array of length len_t, where fail[j] is the length of the longest prefix of t that is also a suffix of t[0..j].

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let's clarify.

The failure function (also called the partial match table) for the KMP algorithm is typically computed as follows:

- For each position i in the pattern t (starting from 0), fail[i] is the length of the longest prefix of t which is also a suffix of t[0..i].

So, for example, if t is "ababcabab", the failure function would be computed for each index up to len(t)-1.

Once the failure function is computed, the KMP automaton transitions can be built as follows:

For each state j (the current length of the matched prefix) and each character c, the next state is determined by checking if c matches t[j]. If yes, then next state is j+1. If not, we backtrack using the failure function until we find a state where c matches t[k], then set the next state to k+1. If no such state exists, the next state is 0.

So, the next_state[j][c] can be precomputed for all j from 0 to len_t-1 and all c.

But when j reaches len_t (the entire pattern is matched), the automaton needs to transition based on the failure function. So for state len_t, the next character is processed by looking at the failure function of len_t-1.

Wait, maybe after a full match (state len_t), the next state is the same as if we had matched up to fail[len_t-1]. So, the next_state for j = len_t is computed as the next_state for j = fail[len_t-1], and then processing the character c.

Thus, to model this, when j reaches len_t, the next state is next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

Therefore, in the precomputed next_state array, we need to handle j = len_t, and for each c, set next_state[len_t][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

So, during the precomputation:

Compute the failure array for j from 0 to len_t-1.

Then, for j = 0 to len_t:

   for each character c:

       if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

           next_state[j][c] = j+1

       else:

           k = fail[j-1] (if j > 0)

           while k > 0 and t[k] != c:

               k = fail[k-1]

           if t[k] == c:

               k +=1

           next_state[j][c] = k

Wait, but for j = len_t, we need to compute the next state as if j was len_t-1, but then backtracked using the failure function. So perhaps for j >= len_t, but in our case, j can't be larger than len_t. So, after a full match (j = len_t), processing a character c would involve backtracking using the failure function of j-1 (which is len_t-1).

But how to compute next_state for j = len_t?

Wait, perhaps j can only be up to len_t. So, during the transition after a full match, the next state is computed as follows:

current j is len_t. Then, for character c, the next state is computed as follows:

k = fail[len_t-1]

then, check if t[k] == c. If yes, then next state is k+1. Else, backtrack using the failure function.

But this is the same as the next_state transition for j = fail[len_t-1].

So, for j = len_t, next_state[j][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

Therefore, during the precomputation of next_state, for j from 0 to len_t, and for each c, compute next_state[j][c] as follows:

For j in 0 to len_t-1:

   for each c:

       if t[j] == c:

           next_state[j][c] = j+1

       else:

           k = fail[j]

           while k > 0 and t[k] != c:

               k = fail[k-1]

           if t[k] == c:

               k +=1

           next_state[j][c] = k

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the standard KMP code for building the failure function and next_state might look like this:

Compute the failure array for j from 1 to len_t-1.

Then, for each j from 0 to len_t-1:

   for each character c:

       if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

           next_state[j][c] = j+1

       else:

           k = fail[j]

           next_state[j][c] = next_state[k][c]

But perhaps this is not exactly correct.

Alternatively, the code to compute next_state[j][c] for each j is as follows:

for j in 0 to len_t:

   for each c in 'a' to 'z':

       if j < len_t and c == t[j]:

           next_state[j][c] = j + 1

       else:

           next_state[j][c] = next_state[fail[j]][c]

But to compute fail[j], we need the failure function for each j.

This approach is inspired by the Aho-Corasick automaton, where the failure function is used to build the transitions.

But how to compute the failure function?

The standard KMP failure function is computed as follows:

Initialize fail[0] = 0.

For j from 1 to len_t-1:

   k = fail[j-1]

   while k > 0 and t[j] != t[k]:

       k = fail[k-1]

   if t[j] == t[k]:

       k += 1

   fail[j] = k

But perhaps we need to compute the failure function for j up to len_t.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the next_state for j = len_t is handled by using the failure function of len_t-1.

So, perhaps the failure function for j = len_t is not required, as we can compute transitions for j = len_t as next_state[len_t][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

Therefore, during the precomputation of next_state, we can handle j = len_t as follows:

Once we have computed the failure function up to j = len_t-1, and computed next_state for j up to len_t-1, then for j = len_t, for each character c, next_state[len_t][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c].

So, now, after precomputing next_state for j up to len_t, we can model the transitions in the DP.

Now, for the DP:

We need to track for each position in s, the possible states (from 0 to len_t) and the maximum number of occurrences possible up to that point.

The initial state is state 0, with 0 occurrences.

For each character in s:

   For each possible state j in the previous step:

       For each possible character c that the current character can be (if it's '?', all 26 letters; else, only the fixed character):

           compute the next state j' = next_state[j][c]

           count_increase = 0

           if j' == len_t:

               count_increase = 1

           then, the new count would be the previous count + count_increase

           update the DP for state j' with the maximum value between its current value and (current count + count_increase)

But since each step's DP depends only on the previous step, we can optimize space by using two 1D arrays: previous and current.

Moreover, since the transitions can be done for each state j and each possible c, we need to iterate over all possible j's and possible c's (if the current character is a '?').

But considering that the current character may be a '?', which allows 26 possibilities, the time complexity per step would be O(len_t * 26), which is acceptable since len_t can be up to 1e5 and s up to 1e5, leading to 1e5 * 1e5 * 26 = 2.6e10 operations, which is way too slow.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 1e5 * 1e5 is 1e10, multiplied by 26 gives 2.6e11 operations. That's way beyond the acceptable limits for a 3-second time constraint (which can handle around 3e8 operations).

But the problem statement says that the product of |s| and |t| is up to 1e7. So, if s is 1e5 and t is 1e2, their product is 1e7. So, in that case, 1e5 * 1e2 * 26 = 2.6e7, which is manageable.

Ah, right! The product |s| * |t| is up to 1e7. So, the total possible operations for the DP would be O(|s| * |t| * 26). Since 1e7 * 26 is 2.6e8, which is manageable within 3 seconds (assuming each operation is simple).

So, this approach is feasible given the constraints.

Now, the steps to implement this:

1. Precompute the failure function for t.

2. Precompute the next_state transitions for each j (0 to len_t) and each character c (a-z).

3. Initialize the DP with previous state 0, count 0.

4. For each character in s:

   a. Initialize the current DP array as all -infinity.

   b. For each possible state j in the previous DP:

       i. If the previous count for j is -infinity, skip.

       ii. For each possible character c (either fixed or all 26 if '?'):

           - compute j' = next_state[j][c]

           - compute the new count as previous_count + (1 if j' == len_t else 0)

           - update current[j'] to be the maximum between its current value and the new count.

   c. Set previous = current for the next iteration.

5. After processing all characters, the answer is the maximum value in the previous DP array.

Now, the key is to efficiently handle the transitions for each character.

But how to handle the case where the current character is '?', which allows all 26 possible letters.

So, for each '?', we need to iterate through all 26 letters and compute transitions for each possible c. For fixed characters, we only process that one c.

But even when the current character is a fixed one, we can use the same code path by iterating only that c.

So, the code can be structured as follows:

For each character in s:

   if current_char is not '?':

       chars = [current_char]

   else:

       chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

   for each j in 0..len_t:

       if previous[j] is -infinity:

           continue

       for c in chars:

           j_next = next_state[j][c]

           count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

           if current[j_next] < previous[j] + count_inc:

               current[j_next] = previous[j] + count_inc

This way, for fixed characters, the loop over c runs once; for '?', it runs 26 times.

This approach should fit within the time constraints given the product of |s| and |t| is up to 1e7.

Now, let's consider the implementation details.

First, precomputing the failure function for t.

Implementing the failure function correctly is crucial. Let's write code for that.

def compute_failure(t):
    len_t = len(t)
    fail = [0] * len_t
    k = 0
    for j in range(1, len_t):
        while k > 0 and t[j] != t[k]:
            k = fail[k-1]
        if t[j] == t[k]:
            k += 1
        fail[j] = k
    return fail

Then, precompute the next_state array.

We can represent next_state as a list of dictionaries, where next_state[j] is a dictionary mapping characters to the next state. However, using a list of lists (with 26 entries per j) would be more efficient, as we can convert characters to indices (0-25).

So, for each j in 0 to len_t:

   for each c in 'a' to 'z':

       compute next_state[j][c]

But to compute this, for each j, and each c, we need to:

if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

   next_state[j][c] = j+1

else:

   backtrack using the failure function.

But for efficiency, we can compute next_state[j][c] using the failure function.

Alternatively, the code can be written as:

def compute_next_state(t, fail):

    next_state = [ [0]*26 for _ in range(len_t + 1) ]  # 0...len_t

        for c_idx in range(26):
            c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)

                    # for j = len_t, the failure is fail[len_t-1]
                    # so, if j == len_t:
                    #    k = fail[len_t-1]
                    # else:
                    #    k = fail[j-1] (but j can be up to len_t)
                    # Wait, the failure array is of length len_t, for j from 0 to len_t-1.
                    # So, for j >= len_t, perhaps it's treated as a special case.

                    # For j in 0..len_t:
                    if j == len_t:
                        # handle as per after a full match
                        k = fail[len_t-1]
                    else:
                        # j < len_t
                        k = fail[j] if j < len_t else 0  # not sure. Maybe j can't be len_t here.

                    # Now, backtrack using k to find the next possible state
                    # but perhaps we can use the precomputed next_state[k][c_idx]
                    # Wait, but how?

                    # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute next_state[j][c] as follows:
                    # if j is len_t:
                    #     k = fail[len_t-1]
                    #     next_state[j][c] = next_state[k][c]
                    # else:
                    #     if t[j] == c:
                    #         next_state[j][c] = j+1
                    #     else:
                    #         next_state[j][c] = next_state[fail[j]][c]

                    # So, recursively using the next_state for fail[j].

                    # But this requires that the next_state for fail[j] has already been computed.

                    # Therefore, to compute next_state[j][c], we can:

                    # For j from 0 to len_t:
                    if j < len_t and t[j] == c:
                        next_state[j][c_idx] = j + 1
                    else:
                        if j == len_t:
                            # use fail[len_t-1]
                            k = fail[len_t-1]
                        else:
                            # j < len_t
                            k = fail[j] if j > 0 else 0
                        next_state[j][c_idx] = next_state[k][c_idx]

    # Then, handle the j = len_t case.

    # Wait, j can be up to len_t. So, for j in 0..len_t:

    # But when j is len_t, we can't compare t[j], since t has len_t characters (0-based up to len_t-1).

    # So, for j = len_t:

    # next_state[len_t][c] = next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c]

    # So, for j = len_t, iterate through each c:

    for c_idx in range(26):
        c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)
        # j = len_t
        # So, the next state is next_state[fail[len_t-1]][c]
        k = fail[len_t-1] if len_t > 0 else 0
        next_state[len_t][c_idx] = next_state[k][c_idx]

    return next_state

Hmm, perhaps this approach will build the next_state correctly.

Alternatively, during the initial loop for j from 0 to len_t, compute next_state[j][c] as follows:

for j in 0 to len_t:

   for each c in a-z:

       if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

           next_state[j][c] = j + 1

       else:

           if j == 0:

               next_state[j][c] = 0

           else:

               if j <= len_t-1:

                   k = fail[j]

               else:

                   k = fail[len_t-1]

               next_state[j][c] = next_state[k][c]

But this would recursively use the next_state for k. However, this approach can be implemented by iterating j from 0 to len_t, and for each j, and each c, compute next_state[j][c] based on the fail[j] (or fail[len_t-1] if j == len_t).

But how to handle this correctly?

This seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, the standard way to compute the next_state is by using the failure function, and building next_state[j][c] for each j and c.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the KMP automaton:

The next_state[j][c] is the state you transition to when in state j and encounter character c.

To compute this, for each j from 0 to len_t:

   if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

       next_state[j][c] = j + 1

   else:

       next_state[j][c] = next_state[fail[j]][c]

But here, fail[j] is the failure function for state j.

Wait, but the failure function for state j in KMP is the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix of t[0..j-1]. So, for j = len_t, the failure function would be the same as for j = len_t-1.

But in our case, the next_state array includes transitions for j up to len_t. So, how is the failure function extended for j = len_t?

Alternatively, for j >= len_t, we treat j as len_t. But perhaps the failure function for j = len_t is the same as for j = len_t-1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's proceed with the code.

Once the next_state array is correctly built, the DP can be handled.

Now, let's move to the DP part.

Initialize previous as a dictionary (or list) where previous[j] is the maximum number of occurrences achievable when in state j after processing the first i characters.

Initially, previous[0] = 0, and all others are -infinity.

For each character in s:

   create a new current list initialized to -infinity.

   for each j in 0..len_t:

       if previous[j] is -infinity:

           continue

       for each possible c in the allowed characters (based on s[i]):

           c_idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

           j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

           count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

           new_count = previous[j] + count_inc

           if new_count > current[j_next]:

               current[j_next] = new_count

   previous = current.copy()

After processing all characters, the maximum value in previous is the answer.

Now, handling the allowed characters:

For each character in s:

   if it's '?', iterate through all 26 letters.

   else, only iterate through that single character.

But in code, we can represent this as:

current_char = s[i]

if current_char == '?':

   chars = [chr(ord('a') + c_idx) for c_idx in range(26)]

else:

   chars = [current_char]

Then, for each c in chars:

   c_idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

But wait, the next_state is indexed by c's 0-25 index. So, for example, 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.

So, the code for processing each character would be:

for i in range(len_s):

    current_char = s[i]

    if current_char == '?':

        # iterate over all possible characters

        for c_idx in range(26):

            ... process c_idx ...

    else:

        c_idx = ord(current_char) - ord('a')

        ... process c_idx ...

But wait, the current_char is not '?', so it's a fixed character, possibly not in 'a'-'z'? But according to the problem statement, s and t consist of small Latin letters and '?', so the characters other than '?' are lowercase letters. So no problem.

So, in code:

for each character in s:

   if it's '?', loop through all 26 c_idx.

   else, loop through the single c_idx.

Now, putting it all together.

The steps are:

1. Read s and t.

2. Compute the failure function for t.

3. Compute the next_state array.

4. Initialize previous array.

5. For each character in s:

   a. For each state j in previous:

       i. if previous[j] is -infinity, skip.

       ii. for each possible c_idx (based on current character):

           compute j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

           compute count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

           update current[j_next] with max(current[j_next], previous[j] + count_inc)

6. The answer is the maximum value in the previous array after processing all characters.

But in code, how to represent the previous and current arrays?

We can represent them as lists of integers of length len_t + 1 (since j can be 0..len_t).

Initially, previous is [ -infinity ] * (len_t + 1), then set previous[0] = 0.

Now, code outline:

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

len_s = len(s)

len_t = len(t)

if len_t == 0:

    print(0)

    exit()

# Precompute failure function and next_state

fail = compute_failure(t)

next_state = compute_next_state(t, fail)

# Initialize DP

prev_dp = [ -float('inf') ] * (len_t + 1)

prev_dp[0] = 0

for i in range(len_s):

    curr_dp = [ -float('inf') ] * (len_t + 1)

    current_char = s[i]

    if current_char == '?':

        # iterate all 26 characters

        for c_idx in range(26):

            c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)

            # process each possible c for this step

            for j in range(len_t + 1):

                if prev_dp[j] == -float('inf'):

                    continue

                j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

                count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

                new_count = prev_dp[j] + count_inc

                if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                    curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

    else:

        c = current_char

        c_idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

        # process only this c

        for j in range(len_t + 1):

            if prev_dp[j] == -float('inf'):

                continue

            j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

            count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

            new_count = prev_dp[j] + count_inc

            if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

    prev_dp = curr_dp

max_occurrences = max(prev_dp)

print(max_occurrences if max_occurrences != -float('inf') else 0)

But this code has a problem: the loops for j in range(len_t + 1) are inside the loop for c_idx. Which would be O(len_t * 26) per character for '?', and O(len_t) for fixed characters. However, given the product of |s| and |t| is up to 1e7, this is acceptable.

But wait, no. For each character in s, and for each possible j in previous, we iterate through all possible c in chars. So, for '?', for each j, we loop 26 times. This would be O(len_t * 26) per character. And since |s| * |t| is up to 1e7, this would be 1e7 * 26 = 2.6e8 operations. Which is acceptable for a 3-second time limit.

But the code as outlined above is O(len_s * len_t * 26), which is acceptable.

But wait, the code for the '?' case is:

for each possible c_idx (26):

    for each possible j in prev_dp (len_t + 1):

        process j and c_idx.

But this is O(26 * len_t) per character.

But in the code outline, for the '?' case, the loop is:

for c_idx in 0..25:

    for j in 0..len_t:

        compute j_next and update curr_dp[j_next].

But this is O(26 * len_t) per character.

Which is correct.

But in the code as written, for each j in prev_dp, and for each c in chars (26 for '?'), the code checks all j's. However, this approach is not optimal because for each j, we process all c's, which may lead to multiple updates to curr_dp.

But in practice, this is manageable.

Now, let's test the code against the examples.

First example:

Input:

winlose???winl???w??
win

The t is 'win', len_t=3.

Precompute failure function for 'win':

t[0] = 'w', fail[0] = 0.

t[1] = 'i', comparing with j=1, k=0.

t[1] != t[0], so fail[1] = 0.

t[2] = 'n', comparing with j=2, k=0.

t[2] != t[0], so fail[2] = 0.

So fail = [0, 0, 0].

Now, next_state for j=0:

For 'w': next_state[0][w's index] = 1.

For other characters, since j=0 and t[0] != c, next_state[0][c] = next_state[fail[0]][c] = next_state[0][c], which is 0 except for 'w'.

Wait, perhaps the code for next_state isn't correct. Let's take j=0 and c is not 'w'.

For j=0, c != 'w', then:

next_state[0][c] = next_state[fail[0]][c] = next_state[0][c], which would be 0.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the code for next_state.

Wait, perhaps the code for next_state is not correctly handling the case where j=0 and c is not t[j].

In the code for compute_next_state, for j=0:

if j < len_t and t[j] == c: then next_state[j][c] = j+1.

Else:

if j == 0:

   next_state[j][c] = 0.

Else:

   k = fail[j-1], etc.

Wait, perhaps the code for next_state[j][c] is:

if j < len_t and t[j] == c: next_state[j][c] = j+1.

Else:

   if j == 0:

       next_state[j][c] = 0.

   else:

       if j <= len_t-1:

           k = fail[j-1]

       else:

           k = fail[len_t-1]

       next_state[j][c] = next_state[k][c]

But for j=0 and c != t[0], next_state[0][c] is 0.

Which is correct. Because in state 0, if the character is not t[0], the next state remains 0.

So, in the first example, when the current character is 'w', the next state increases to 1. For other characters, the next state is 0.

But in the first example, after processing the first 'w' in s, the state becomes 1. Then 'i' makes it 2, then 'n' makes it 3 (len_t), which increments the count by 1, and the next state is next_state[3][c], which is next_state[fail[2]][c], which is next_state[0][c].

So, the transitions after a full match (state 3) will reset the state to 0 for the next character.

This code should correctly model the overlapping cases.

Now, the third example:

Input:

??c?????
abcab

Output: 2.

The output string is 'abcabcab'.

The t is 'abcab'.

The occurrences are at positions 0 and 3:

abcab occurs at 0-4, and then the next 'ab' starts at position 3 (assuming overlapping).

So, after processing 'abcab', the next characters are 'c', which may allow another occurrence.

But according to the example, the maximum is 2.

The code should model this correctly.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, let's implement it in Python.

But in Python, using lists and loops, we need to handle the next_state as a list of lists, where each sublist is for each character (a-z).

But since the code may be slow for large cases, we need to optimize.

An optimized way to represent next_state is as a list of lists, where each sublist is 26 integers (for the 26 letters). This allows O(1) access.

But building next_state can be done as follows:

def compute_failure(t):

    len_t = len(t)

    fail = [0] * len_t

    k = 0

    for j in range(1, len_t):

        while k > 0 and t[j] != t[k]:

            k = fail[k-1]

        if t[j] == t[k]:

            k += 1

        fail[j] = k

    return fail

def compute_next_state(t, fail):

    len_t = len(t)

    next_state = [ [0]*26 for _ in range(len_t + 1) ]

    for j in range(len_t + 1):

        for c_idx in range(26):

            c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)

            if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

                next_state[j][c_idx] = j + 1

            else:

                if j == 0:

                    next_state[j][c_idx] = 0

                else:

                    if j <= len_t - 1:

                        k = fail[j-1]

                    else:

                        k = fail[len_t-1]

                    next_state[j][c_idx] = next_state[k][c_idx]

    return next_state

But this code may not handle j = len_t correctly. Let's see.

For j = len_t, the code checks:

if j < len_t: no.

else:

   if j ==0: no.

   else:

       j <= len_t-1: no (since j is len_t).

       so k = fail[len_t-1]

       next_state[j][c_idx] = next_state[k][c_idx]

Which is correct.

Thus, this code should correctly compute the next_state.

Now, the DP part.

But in Python, using nested loops for j and c_idx may be slow for large cases. So, we need to optimize.

One possible optimization is to precompute for each j, the possible transitions for all c, and when processing a fixed character, only process the corresponding c_idx.

But in Python, loops are generally slower than in compiled languages. So, perhaps we can precompute the next_state as a list of lists and use integer indices for characters.

But given the constraints, this should be manageable.

Another optimization is to avoid using floating-point infinity and instead use a very large negative number (like -1e18) to represent invalid states.

But in Python, using a list for prev_dp and curr_dp initialized to -infinity and updated with max.

Putting it all together:

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

len_s = len(s)

len_t = len(t)

if len_t == 0:

    print(0)

    exit()

if len_t > len_s:

    print(0)

    exit()

# Precompute failure function and next_state

fail = [0] * len_t

k = 0

for j in range(1, len_t):

    while k > 0 and t[j] != t[k]:

        k = fail[k-1]

    if t[j] == t[k]:

        k += 1

    fail[j] = k

# Compute next_state

next_state = [ [0]*26 for _ in range(len_t + 1) ]

for j in range(len_t + 1):

    for c_idx in range(26):

        c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)

        if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

            next_state[j][c_idx] = j + 1

        else:

            if j == 0:

                next_state[j][c_idx] = 0

            else:

                if j <= len_t - 1:

                    k_val = fail[j-1]

                else:

                    k_val = fail[len_t - 1]

                next_state[j][c_idx] = next_state[k_val][c_idx]

# Initialize DP

prev_dp = [ -1e18 ] * (len_t + 1)

prev_dp[0] = 0

for i in range(len_s):

    curr_dp = [ -1e18 ] * (len_t + 1)

    current_char = s[i]

    if current_char == '?':

        for c_idx in range(26):

            for j in range(len_t + 1):

                if prev_dp[j] == -1e18:

                if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

    else:

        for j in range(len_t + 1):

            count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

            new_count = prev_dp[j] + count_inc

            if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

print(max(max_occurrences, 0))

Wait, but in Python, loops inside loops may be slow. For example, for each '?', we loop over 26 c_idx and for each j in len_t+1. Let's see.

But given the problem constraints, and the product |s|*|t| is up to 1e7, and len_t+1 up to 1e5+1, then for each '?', the number of operations is 26 * 1e5, which for 1e5 characters would be 2.6e9 operations, which is way too much.

But the problem states that the product |s|*|t| is up to 1e7, so 1e7 * 26 is 2.6e8 operations, which is manageable.

But in Python, even 1e8 operations take around 10 seconds. So, this code may not pass within the time limit.

Hmm, this is a problem. So, the code as written may be too slow for large inputs.

What can be done to optimize it?

The key is to find a way to reduce the number of operations.

An observation: when processing a character, whether it's fixed or '?', for each j in the previous state, we can compute the possible transitions and update the current state.

But the current code iterates over all j in the previous state and for each possible c, computes j_next.

However, many j's in the previous state may have a value of -infinity, which can be skipped.

So, for each character, instead of iterating over all j in 0..len_t, we can track only the j's that have a valid previous_dp[j] value.

This way, for each character, we only process j's that are active (i.e., have a non -infinity value), which could reduce the number of iterations.

For example, if in the previous step, only a few j's are active, the loop can process those j's and ignore the others.

So, we can modify the code to:

For each character:

   create a list of active j's where prev_dp[j] != -infinity.

   for each active j:

       process possible c's.

This can significantly reduce the number of iterations.

Let's modify the code accordingly.

During each step, after processing a character, we can collect the active j's for the next step.

But since the transitions can lead to multiple j_next, and curr_dp[j_next] is updated, we can track active j's for the current step.

But perhaps it's easier to, for each step, iterate over the active j's from the previous step.

So, the code would be:

prev_dp is a list where prev_dp[j] is the maximum occurrences for state j.

active_js = list of j's where prev_dp[j] != -infinity.

For each character:

   curr_dp initialized to -infinity.

   active_js_current = []

   for j in active_js:

       process all c's for this character.

   active_js for next step is the j_next's where curr_dp[j_next] is updated.

But how to track active_js_current?

Alternatively, during each character processing, iterate over all j in active_js (from previous step), and for each j, process all possible c's.

This reduces the number of j's to process.

So, the code can be optimized as follows:

Initialize active_js as a list of j's where prev_dp[j] is not -infinity.

Initially, active_js = [0] since prev_dp[0] = 0.

Then, for each character in s:

   curr_dp = [ -inf ] * (len_t + 1)

   new_active_js = set()

   for j in active_js:

       current_val = prev_dp[j]

       if current_val == -inf:

           continue

       if current_char == '?':

           for c_idx in range(26):

               j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

               count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

               new_count = current_val + count_inc

               if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                   if curr_dp[j_next] == -inf:

                       new_active_js.add(j_next)

                   curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

       else:

           c_idx = ord(current_char) - ord('a')

           j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

           count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

           new_count = current_val + count_inc

           if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

               if curr_dp[j_next] == -inf:

                   new_active_js.add(j_next)

               curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

   prev_dp = curr_dp

   active_js = list(new_active_js)

But this approach may miss some j_next's that are updated to a higher value but were already present.

For example, if a j_next is already in new_active_js, but another j' in active_js processes a c that leads to the same j_next with a higher count.

So, we need to make sure that all possible j's that can update j_next are considered.

But if we process all j's in active_js, and for each j, process all possible c's, then the new_active_js will collect all j_next's that have at least one transition leading to them.

But in this approach, when multiple j's lead to the same j_next, the curr_dp[j_next] is updated to the maximum possible value.

But the new_active_js is the set of j_next's that have been updated from -inf to a valid value.

However, if a j_next was already in new_active_js, but a higher value is found, it's still part of new_active_js.

But the problem is that when you process multiple j's, a j_next can be added to new_active_js once, and later j's may update it again but not add it again.

But this doesn't matter because the new_active_js is just the set of j_next's that have at least one valid entry. Processing all active_js j's ensures that all possible transitions are considered.

But to track all j_next's that have been updated, perhaps it's better to use a dictionary or a boolean array to track which j_next's have been added.

Alternatively, we can ignore tracking active_js and instead, during the next step, process all j's where curr_dp[j] is not -inf. But this would require iterating through all len_t +1 j's again, which is not efficient.

But with the initial approach of tracking active_js, the number of j's processed per step is reduced.

So, modifying the code to track active_js:

prev_dp = [ -inf ] * (len_t + 1)

prev_dp[0] = 0

active_js = [0]

for i in range(len_s):

    curr_dp = [ -inf ] * (len_t + 1)

    new_active = set()

    current_char = s[i]

    for j in active_js:

        current_val = prev_dp[j]

        if current_val == -inf:

            continue

        if current_char == '?':

            for c_idx in range(26):

                j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

                count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

                new_count = current_val + count_inc

                if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                    curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

                    new_active.add(j_next)

        else:

            c_idx = ord(current_char) - ord('a')

            j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

            count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

            new_count = current_val + count_inc

            if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

                new_active.add(j_next)

    # After processing all j in active_js:

    # Update prev_dp and active_js

    prev_dp = curr_dp

    active_js = list(new_active)

This way, in each step, only the j's in active_js are processed, which can significantly reduce the number of iterations.

For example, if in the previous step, active_js has only a few j's, then the loop over active_js is much faster.

This optimization is crucial to make the code run within the time limits.

Thus, the code should be modified to track active_js.

This reduces the number of j's processed per character from len_t + 1 to the number of active j's, which can be much smaller.

Thus, this should make the code fast enough.

Now, implementing this in Python:

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

len_s = len(s)

len_t = len(t)

if len_t == 0 or len_t > len_s:

    print(0)

    exit()

# Precompute failure function and next_state

k = 0

for j in range(1, len_t):

    while k > 0 and t[j] != t[k]:

        k = fail[k-1]

    if t[j] == t[k]:

        k += 1

    fail[j] = k

next_state = [[0]*26 for _ in range(len_t +1)]

for j in range(len_t +1):

    for c_idx in range(26):

        c = chr(ord('a') + c_idx)

        if j < len_t and t[j] == c:

            next_state[j][c_idx] = j+1

        else:

            if j == 0:

                next_state[j][c_idx] = 0

            else:

                if j <= len_t -1:

                    k_val = fail[j-1]

                else:

                    k_val = fail[-1]

                next_state[j][c_idx] = next_state[k_val][c_idx]

prev_dp = [-1e18]*(len_t +1)

prev_dp[0] = 0

active_js = [0]

for i in range(len_s):

    curr_dp = [-1e18]*(len_t +1)

    new_active = set()

    current_char = s[i]

    for j in active_js:

        current_val = prev_dp[j]

        if current_val == -1e18:

            continue

        if current_char == '?':

            for c_idx in range(26):

                j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

                count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

                new_count = current_val + count_inc

                if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                    curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

                    new_active.add(j_next)

        else:

            c_idx = ord(current_char) - ord('a')

            j_next = next_state[j][c_idx]

            count_inc = 1 if j_next == len_t else 0

            new_count = current_val + count_inc

            if new_count > curr_dp[j_next]:

                curr_dp[j_next] = new_count

                new_active.add(j_next)

    prev_dp = curr_dp

    active_js = list(new_active)

max_occurrences = max(prev_dp)

print(max(max_occurrences,0))

This code should handle the cases efficiently.

Testing the first example:

Input:
winlose???winl???w??
win

After processing, the code should output 5.

The code should correctly track the state transitions and count each occurrence.

Another example:

Input:
??c?????
abcab

The code should output 2.

Thus, the code is likely correct.
