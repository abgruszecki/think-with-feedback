Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of ways to choose two suspects such that at least p coders agree with the choice. Each coder has two suspects they named, and a coder agrees if at least one of their two is chosen. The output is the count of all possible pairs of suspects (unordered) that meet the p threshold.

First, let's understand the problem. For each possible pair (a, b), I need to determine how many coders have at least one of a or b in their pair (xi, yi). If that count is >= p, then this pair is valid. The task is to find the total number of such valid pairs.

But considering the constraints, n can be up to 3e5. If we check all possible pairs naively, that's O(n^2) which is 9e10 operations—way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Hmm. Let's think about how to compute for a given pair (a, b) the number of coders who have a or b in their xi or yi.

Each coder's contribution to a pair (a, b) is 1 if either a or b is in their pair. So the total for (a,b) is the sum over all coders of 1 if a or b is in their pair, else 0.

So the problem reduces to, for each possible pair (a,b), calculate S_ab = the number of coders whose pair includes a or b. Then count how many pairs (a,b) have S_ab >= p.

The challenge is to compute S_ab efficiently for all possible pairs.

Let me think about how to model this. For each coder i, their two suspects are x_i and y_i. So the pairs that include x_i will get a contribution from this coder. Similarly for y_i.

But when considering a pair (a, b), S_ab is the number of coders where x_i is a or b, or y_i is a or b.

Wait, no. For each coder, their two options are x_i and y_i. So the coder will agree with (a, b) if either a is x_i or y_i, or b is x_i or y_i. Wait no—the coder's own pair is (x_i, y_i). So a coder i agrees with the pair (s, t) if s is x_i or y_i, OR t is x_i or y_i. Because the chosen pair must include at least one of the two the coder mentioned.

So S_ab is the number of coders i where x_i is a or x_i is b or y_i is a or y_i is b.

Wait, no. Wait, the pair (a, b) must have at least one of the coder's x_i or y_i. So for coder i to agree, a must be x_i or y_i, OR b must be x_i or y_i. Wait, no. Wait, the coder i's pair is (x_i, y_i), and the chosen pair is (a, b). So the coder i will agree if either a is in {x_i, y_i} OR b is in {x_i, y_i} OR both. So yes. So for each i, if a is x_i or y_i, or b is x_i or y_i, then the coder agrees.

So S_ab is the number of coders i where (x_i or y_i) is a or (x_i or y_i) is b. Which can be written as the number of coders where x_i or y_i is in {a, b}.

So S_ab is the count of coders i for which {a, b} ∩ {x_i, y_i} is non-empty.

So how can we compute S_ab for all possible pairs (a, b) efficiently?

The straightforward approach is for each pair (a, b), compute the sum of all coders where either x_i is a, x_i is b, y_i is a, or y_i is b. But checking each pair directly is O(n^2), which is impossible for n=3e5.

Alternative approach: precompute for each a, the set of coders that have a in their pair. Then, for a pair (a, b), S_ab is the size of the union of the two sets (a's coders and b's coders). The size of the union is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. So if we can precompute for each a, |A| (number of coders that have a in their pair), and for each pair (a,b), the size of the intersection (number of coders that have both a and b in their pair), then S_ab = count[a] + count[b] - intersect[a][b].

But storing intersect for all pairs is O(n^2), which is again impossible. So this approach is not feasible unless we can find a way to compute intersect[a][b] quickly.

Wait, but the number of possible pairs (a, b) that have a non-zero intersection might be manageable. Let's think: for each coder i, their pair (x_i, y_i) contributes to the intersect of x_i and y_i. So for a pair (a, b), the intersect count is the number of coders i where (x_i, y_i) is (a, b) or (b, a), since the order in the coders' pairs doesn't matter. Wait, no: for a coder i with x_i = a and y_i = b, then a and b are in their pair. So in the intersect of a and b, this coder is counted once. So the intersect for (a, b) is the number of coders where (x_i, y_i) is (a, b), (b, a), or any permutation where both a and b are present in the coder's pair.

Wait, no. For a coder i, their pair is (x_i, y_i). So the intersect between a and b is the number of coders i where both a and b are in the coder's pair. So for example, if x_i is a and y_i is b, that's a +1. If x_i is b and y_i is a, that's another +1. Also, if a coder has x_i = a and y_i = c (some other), but then their pair includes a but not b. So the intersect is 0 for (a, b) unless both a and b are in the coder's pair.

So the total intersect between a and b is the number of coders i where (x_i, y_i) is either (a, b), (b, a), or (a, c) where c is b, or (c, a) where c is b. Wait, no. For a coder i, their pair can be (a, b), (b, a), (a, c) where c is b, etc. Wait, no. For a coder's pair (x_i, y_i), the intersect between a and b is 1 if x_i is a and y_i is b, or x_i is b and y_i is a. Or if x_i is a and y_i is some other value, but if the other value is also a? No, because the problem states that xi != yi. So for each coder i, their pair is two distinct numbers. So the only way a coder i contributes to the intersect of a and b is if their pair is (a, b) or (b, a). Because otherwise, if their pair is (a, c) and c is not b, then the intersect between a and b would require both a and b to be present in the coder's pair, which they are not. So for example, if a coder has x_i = a and y_i = c (c != b), then a is in their pair, but b is not. So in S_ab, this coder would be counted if a is part of the pair (a, b), but the intersect (a, b) counts coders where both a and b are in the pair. So this coder's pair (a, c) doesn't contribute to the intersect between a and b.

So the intersect between a and b is the number of coders i where (x_i, y_i) is (a, b) or (b, a). Because those are the only pairs where both a and b are present in the coder's pair.

So for each coder i, if their x_i and y_i are a and b (in any order), then that contributes 1 to the intersect between a and b.

So first, for all coders, we can precompute the count for each (a, b) where a < b, and for a and b in the coder's pair. Wait, but since (a, b) and (b, a) are considered the same in the pair (since the pair is unordered?), no. Wait, the coder's pair is ordered (xi, yi), but in the problem statement, the pair (xi, yi) is a pair, but perhaps it's unordered. Wait, no, the problem says each coder i said either x or y. So the coder's pair is two distinct people, but the order doesn't matter for our purposes. Because for S_ab, we just check if either a or b is in the coder's pair.

Wait, no. The coder's pair is two people, but when a and b are the suspects, the coder agrees if either a is in their pair, or b is in their pair. So the order in which the coder said x or y doesn't matter. So for example, if a coder's pair is (x, y), then for S_ab, it's sufficient that a is x or y, or b is x or y. So the order between x and y in the coder's pair doesn't affect anything.

So for the intersect between a and b, it's the number of coders whose pair includes both a and b. So the pairs (a, b) and (b, a) in the coder's pair are considered the same. So for each coder i, if their pair (x_i, y_i) is a and b (regardless of order), then they contribute to the intersect of a and b.

Therefore, the intersect between a and b is the number of coders i where x_i and y_i are a and b, in any order.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each a, count[a] is the number of coders that include a in their pair. So for a coder with pair (x, y), x and y each contribute 1 to count[x] and count[y].

2. Precompute for each unordered pair (a, b), the number of coders that have both a and b in their pair. Let's call this overlap[(a, b)].

Then, for any pair (a, b), S_ab = count[a] + count[b] - overlap[(a, b)].

Because count[a] includes all coders that have a in their pair (which includes those that have both a and b), and count[b] includes all coders that have b (including those with both a and b). But the overlap (those with both) are counted twice, so we subtract once.

So the formula is correct.

Now, the problem is to compute for all possible unordered pairs (a, b) the value of count[a] + count[b] - overlap[(a, b)], and count how many such pairs have this value >= p.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The steps are:

- Compute count for each a.
- Compute overlap for each unordered pair (a, b) where a < b (to avoid duplicates).
- Then, for each possible unordered pair (a, b), compute S_ab = count[a] + count[b] - overlap.get((a, b), 0), and check if S_ab >= p.

The main challenge is handling the overlaps. How many possible overlaps are there?

Each coder's pair (x, y) contributes to one overlap pair (the pair sorted as (min(x,y), max(x,y))). So the total number of possible overlap entries is O(n), since each coder contributes exactly one pair, but multiple coders can contribute to the same pair. So for example, if two coders have pairs (a, b), then overlap[(a, b)] is 2.

Therefore, the number of keys in the overlap dictionary is up to n, but each key is an unordered pair (a, b). So for each coder, we can process their pair, sort it (so a < b), and increment the count in the overlap for that pair.

So, steps:

1. Read all n coders' pairs (x_i, y_i).

2. For each a, count[a] is the number of times a appears in x_i or y_i.

3. For each pair (x_i, y_i), create a sorted tuple (min(x_i, y_i), max(x_i, y_i)), and for each such tuple, increment the overlap count for that pair.

Once these are computed, then for each possible pair (a, b) where a < b, the overlap is stored. For pairs (a, b) where a >= b, we can swap them to get the correct key. But since we need to process all possible unordered pairs (a, b), perhaps it's easier to generate all possible a < b pairs first.

Now, the problem is to compute all possible pairs (a, b), which is O(n^2) in the worst case. But n is 3e5, which makes O(n^2) impossible. So there's a need for an O(n) or O(n sqrt(n)) approach.

Wait, but if we can precompute all possible pairs (a, b) such that count[a] + count[b] - overlap[(a, b)] >= p.

But how?

Alternative approach:

The total number of possible pairs (a, b) is C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2, which for n=3e5 is around 4.5e10—way too big. So iterating over all possible pairs is impossible.

So this suggests that the solution must involve some mathematical approach to count the valid pairs without enumerating them all.

Hmm. So the problem is to find the number of unordered pairs (a, b) such that count[a] + count[b] - overlap[(a, b)] >= p.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let me think differently. Let's consider that overlap[(a, b)] is the number of coders whose pair is exactly (a, b) or (b, a). So when we compute S_ab = count[a] + count[b] - overlap[(a, b)], this is exactly the number of coders that have a in their pair OR b in their pair (since overlap is the count of those who have both, and we subtract it once to avoid double-counting).

So S_ab is the number of coders that have a or b in their pair.

But how can we find all pairs (a, b) where S_ab >= p?

But even for this, the problem is that for each (a, b), S_ab depends on the individual counts and their overlap.

An alternative idea: For a pair (a, b), S_ab is equal to the sum of count[a] + count[b] minus the number of coders who have both a and b in their pair (overlap). So S_ab is count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab.

Now, to find all pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab >= p.

But how to model this?

Suppose for a moment that overlap_ab is zero. Then the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p. But this is not the case, but perhaps it's a starting point.

But in reality, overlap_ab can vary between 0 and some maximum, which depends on how many coders have both a and b in their pair.

But even if overlap_ab is positive, S_ab is count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab, which is less than count[a] + count[b]. So if we can find pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p, and subtract those pairs where count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, let's consider the set of all possible pairs (a, b). For each such pair, we can compute S_ab as:

S_ab = (number of coders that have a) + (number of coders that have b) - (number of coders that have both a and b).

So the S_ab is equal to the size of the union of the sets of coders that have a and those that have b.

So to find pairs where the size of the union is >= p.

The question is: how can we compute this without checking all possible pairs?

Hmm. Let's think of it in terms of inclusion-exclusion. The size of the union is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|, where A is the set of coders with a in their pair, B is the set with b in their pair.

But the problem is that the overlap (A ∩ B) varies per pair.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each a, the count[a], and then for each pair (a, b), compute S_ab as count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab. Then check if this is >= p.

But again, the problem is the number of pairs.

But maybe there's a way to find the pairs where count[a] + count[b] >= p, and then subtract those pairs where count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, we can compute the total number of pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p, and then subtract the number of pairs where count[a] + count[b] >= p but count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p. But that seems complicated.

Another angle: For a pair (a, b) to be valid, count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab >= p. So, the pairs that are valid are those where count[a] + count[b] >= p + overlap_ab. But since overlap_ab is non-negative, this implies that count[a] + count[b] >= p.

But even if count[a] + count[b] >= p, it's possible that count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p. For example, if count[a] = 3, count[b] = 3, and overlap_ab = 5, then S_ab = 1. If p is 2, then this pair is invalid.

So pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p but their overlap is such that count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p must be excluded.

But how can we efficiently compute this?

Alternatively, the total valid pairs is equal to the number of pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p, minus the number of pairs where count[a] + count[b] >= p but count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p.

But how to compute the latter?

Hmm. Let me think about this. Let's denote:

Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p = number of pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >= p.

Invalid_pairs = number of pairs (a, b) where count[a] + count[b] >= p but (count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab) < p.

Then the answer is Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p - Invalid_pairs.

But how to compute Invalid_pairs?

An invalid pair (a, b) must satisfy:

count[a] + count[b] >= p,

and (count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab) < p.

Which can be rewritten as:

count[a] + count[b] >= p,

and overlap_ab > count[a] + count[b] - p.

But since overlap_ab can be up to min(count[a], count[b]).

But how to find all such pairs (a, b) where overlap_ab > count[a] + count[b] - p.

But since overlap_ab is the number of coders that have both a and b in their pair, and this is stored in the overlap dictionary, perhaps we can iterate over all pairs in the overlap dictionary and check if they contribute to invalid pairs.

Wait, because overlap_ab can only be non-zero for pairs that are present in the overlap dictionary. So for a pair (a, b) not present in the overlap dictionary, overlap_ab is zero, and the condition becomes:

count[a] + count[b] >= p,

and 0 > count[a] + count[b] - p.

Which implies count[a] + count[b] - p < 0.

But count[a] + count[b] >= p (from the first condition), so this is impossible. So the only pairs that can be invalid are those that are present in the overlap dictionary.

So, the Invalid_pairs can be calculated by checking each pair (a, b) in the overlap dictionary, and seeing if:

count[a] + count[b] >= p,

and overlap_ab > count[a] + count[b] - p.

So for each such pair (a, b), if these conditions are met, then this pair is invalid and needs to be subtracted.

Additionally, the pair (a, b) must have been counted in the Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p. So for each such pair (a, b) in the overlap dictionary, we need to check if count[a] + count[b] >= p, and in that case, if the overlap_ab is large enough to make S_ab < p. If so, then this pair is part of the invalid pairs.

So the steps are:

1. Compute count for all a.

2. Compute Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p: the number of unordered pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >= p.

3. Compute Invalid_pairs: for each pair (a, b) in the overlap dictionary (i.e., pairs that have overlap_ab > 0), check if count[a] + count[b] >= p, and overlap_ab > (count[a] + count[b] - p). For each such (a, b), increment Invalid_pairs by 1 if the pair is counted in Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p and the overlap causes S_ab to be < p.

Then the answer is Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p - Invalid_pairs.

But how to compute Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p?

Computing the number of pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >= p.

This is a classic problem, and can be solved efficiently by sorting the counts and using a two-pointer approach.

Let me explain:

- Sort the array of counts in non-decreasing order.

- For each a, find the minimal b where count[a] + count[b] >= p, and sum the number of elements from b to the end.

But since the array is sorted, for each index i (representing a), we can find the smallest j >= i+1 where count[i] + count[j] >= p. The number of elements from j to end (n-1) is (n - j) if j <= n-1. Summing over all i gives the total.

But since the array is sorted, for each i, the required j can be found using binary search.

However, since the array is sorted, a two-pointer approach can also be used, which is O(n) time.

Yes. So here's the algorithm for two pointers:

Initialize two pointers, left and right. For each left, find the minimal right such that count[left] + count[right] >= p. Then all pairs from left+1 to right-1 would sum less than p, and from right to end, sum >= p.

But since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the two pointers can be maintained as follows:

Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Initialize right = n-1.

For left from 0 to n-1:

   while right > left and count[left] + count[right-1] >= p:

       right -= 1

   if count[left] + count[right] >= p:

       total += (n - right)

So the idea is that for each left, right starts from the end and moves left as much as possible while the sum is still >= p. The number of valid pairs for this left is (n - right). We then move to the next left.

But since after each left increment, right can only move left or stay the same. This way, the two pointers traverse the array in O(n) time.

This approach gives the total number of unordered pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >= p. But the array is sorted, so the indices are different from the original a and b values. However, since we only need the count, the actual values are not important, just their sorted order.

So, after sorting, the two-pointer approach works.

Once Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p is computed, then we need to compute Invalid_pairs.

For Invalid_pairs:

Iterate over all pairs (a, b) in the overlap dictionary. For each such pair, check:

1. a < b (since the overlap dictionary is stored as sorted pairs).

2. count[a] + count[b] >= p (so they were counted in Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p).

3. overlap_ab > (count[a] + count[b] - p) → which implies that count[a] + count[b] - overlap_ab < p → thus S_ab < p.

If all three conditions are met, then this pair is invalid and should be subtracted from the total.

So for each (a, b) in the overlap:

Check if a < b (which they are, as stored in the sorted tuple).

Check if count[a] + count[b] >= p → if not, then this pair is not part of the Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p, so no need to consider.

If count[a] + count[b] >= p, then check if overlap_ab > (count[a] + count[b] - p). If yes, then this pair is invalid.

So for each (a, b) in the overlap dictionary:

if count[a] + count[b] >= p and (overlap_ab > (count[a] + count[b] - p)), then increment Invalid_pairs by 1.

So the process is:

Initialize Invalid_pairs = 0.

For each key (a, b) in the overlap dictionary:

   if a >= b: continue (but since we stored them as sorted, this shouldn't happen).

   current_sum = count[a] + count[b]

   if current_sum >= p:

       required_overlap = current_sum - p + 1

       if overlap[(a, b)] >= required_overlap:

           Invalid_pairs +=1

Wait, because the condition is overlap_ab > (current_sum - p). So:

overlap_ab > current_sum - p → since overlap_ab is an integer >=0.

But current_sum >= p → current_sum - p is >=0.

So if overlap_ab > (current_sum - p), then:

current_sum - overlap_ab < p → S_ab = current_sum - overlap_ab < p.

So in that case, the pair (a, b) was counted in the Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p (since current_sum >= p) but S_ab < p → invalid.

So for each such pair (a, b), if this condition holds, we add 1 to Invalid_pairs.

Thus, the answer is Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p - Invalid_pairs.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

4 2

2 3

1 4

1 4

2 1

Let's compute count for each a:

count[1] = number of coders that have 1 in their pair.

Looking at the input:

Coder 0: 2,3 → count[2] +=1, count[3] +=1.

Coder 1: 1,4 → count[1] +=1, count[4] +=1.

Coder 2: 1,4 → count[1] +=1, count[4] +=1.

Coder 3: 2,1 → count[2] +=1, count[1] +=1.

So counts:

count[1] = 1 (from coder1) + 1 (coder2) + 1 (coder3) → 3.

count[2] = 1 (coder0) + 1 (coder3) → 2.

count[3] = 1 (coder0).

count[4] = 2 (coders 1 and 2).

Wait, let's list all:

count[1] is in coders 1, 2, 3:

Yes. So count[1] = 3.

count[2] appears in coders 0, 3: count[2] = 2.

count[3] in coder 0: 1.

count[4] in coders 1, 2: 2.

count[5+] is 0.

So count array (assuming a ranges up to 4) is:

count[1] = 3, count[2] =2, count[3]=1, count[4]=2.

Then, overlap is built from each coder's pair:

Coder 0: (2,3) → sorted (2,3). So overlap[(2,3)] +=1.

Coder1: (1,4) → overlap[(1,4)] +=1.

Coder2: (1,4) → overlap[(1,4)] +=1.

Coder3: (2,1) → sorted as (1,2) → overlap[(1,2)] +=1.

So overlap dictionary:

(2,3): 1

(1,4): 2

(1,2): 1

Now, compute Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p = 2.

We need to find pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >= 2.

Wait, in the first sample, p=2.

So sorted counts are [1, 2, 2, 3]. Let's see:

But wait, the counts are for a=1,2,3,4. So the list of counts is [3,2,1,2], but when sorted, the sorted list would be [1,2,2,3].

Wait, the counts are for each a in 1..4.

So the list is count[1] =3, count[2]=2, count[3]=1, count[4]=2. So when sorted in non-decreasing order, the sorted list is [1,2,2,3].

So the two-pointer approach will compute the number of pairs where a < b (indices i < j) and sum >= 2.

Wait, p is 2 here. So any pair where sum >=2.

The sorted list is [1, 2, 2, 3].

For each i from 0 to 3:

For i=0 (value 1):

Find the minimal j where j > i and 1 + sorted[j] >=2.

sorted[j] can be 2, 2, 3. All are >= (2-1=1). So j starts at 1. So the number of elements from j=1 to end (3) is 3-1=3 elements. So 3 pairs.

Wait, but i=0, j starts at 1. For j=1, sum is 1+2=3 >=2. So all j >=1 are valid. So there are 3 elements (j=1,2,3). So 3 pairs.

For i=1 (value 2):

j starts at 2. sum is 2+2=4 >=2. j can be 2,3. So 2 elements. So 2 pairs.

For i=2 (value 2):

j starts at 3. sum is 2+3=5 >=2. So j=3. 1 pair.

For i=3 (value3): j must be >3, which is invalid. So 0.

Total pairs: 3+2+1=6. But wait, the sample output is 6. So the Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p is 6. Then, we subtract Invalid_pairs.

Now, compute Invalid_pairs.

Check each pair in the overlap:

(2,3) → count[2] is 2, count[3] is1. sum is 3. p=2. current_sum=3 >=2. overlap is 1. required_overlap = 3 -2 +1 =2. Is overlap_ab > (3-2) → 1>1? No. So no invalid.

So this pair does not contribute to Invalid_pairs.

(1,4): count[1] =3, count[4]=2. sum is5 >=2. overlap is 2. required_overlap is5-2+1=4. So 2 >=4? No. So no.

(1,2): count[1] =3, count[2]=2. sum=5 >=2. overlap=1. required_overlap=5-2+1=4. 1> (5-2)=3? 1>3? No. So no.

So Invalid_pairs is 0. So the answer is 6-0=6, which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input:

8 6

5 6

5 7

5 8

6 2

2 1

7 3

1 3

1 4

So count:

Each coder's pair:

Coder0:5,6 → count5 +=1, count6 +=1.

Coder1:5,7 → count5 +=1, count7 +=1.

Coder2:5,8 → count5 +=1, count8 +=1.

Coder3:6,2 → count6 +=1, count2 +=1.

Coder4:2,1 → count2 +=1, count1 +=1.

Coder5:7,3 → count7 +=1, count3 +=1.

Coder6:1,3 → count1 +=1, count3 +=1.

Coder7:1,4 → count1 +=1, count4 +=1.

So counts:

count1: 3 (coders4,6,7)

count2: 2 (coders3,4)

count3: 2 (coders5,6)

count4:1 (coder7)

count5:3 (coders0,1,2)

count6:2 (coders0,3)

count7:2 (coders1,5)

count8:1 (coder2)

others: 0.

So count array sorted in non-decreasing order: [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]. Wait, let's list all counts:

count1=3, count2=2, count3=2, count4=1, count5=3, count6=2, count7=2, count8=1.

So sorted list is [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3].

p=6. We need to find pairs (a, b) where a < b and count[a] + count[b] >=6.

Let's compute this with two pointers.

sorted list: [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]

Total elements n=8.

Initialize right=7 (index starts at 0).

For left in 0 to 7:

left=0 (value 1):

right=7. sum=1+3=4 <6. So need to move left until sum >=6.

But all elements after left=0 are:

1,2,2,2,2,3,3.

So for left=0, no j>0 gives sum >=6. So contribution 0.

left=1 (1):

sum with right=7 (3) is 1+3=4 <6. No contribution.

left=2 (2):

sum with right=7 (3) → 2+3=5 <6. No.

left=3 (2):

sum 2+3=5 <6.

left=4 (2):

sum 2+3=5 <6.

left=5 (2):

sum 2+3=5 <6.

left=6 (3):

sum 3+3=6 >=6. So j=7 (right=7), contribution 1 (only j=7).

left=7: no j>7.

Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p=1.

Now, check Invalid_pairs.

The overlap dictionary:

For each coder's pair:

Coder0:5,6 → sorted (5,6) → overlap[(5,6)] +=1.

Coder1:5,7 → (5,7) → overlap +=1.

Coder2:5,8 → (5,8) → +=1.

Coder3:6,2 → (2,6) → +=1.

Coder4:2,1 → (1,2) → +=1.

Coder5:7,3 → (3,7) → +=1.

Coder6:1,3 → (1,3) → +=1.

Coder7:1,4 → (1,4) → +=1.

So overlap pairs are:

(5,6):1

(5,7):1

(5,8):1

(2,6):1

(1,2):1

(3,7):1

(1,3):1

(1,4):1

Now, for each of these pairs:

Check if count[a] + count[b] >=6, and overlap_ab > (count[a]+count[b] -6).

Compute for each:

1. (5,6):

count[5]=3, count[6]=2 → sum 5. 5 <6 → no.

2. (5,7):

count[5]=3, count[7]=2 → sum 5 <6.

3. (5,8): sum 3+1=4 <6.

4. (2,6): count2=2, count6=2 → sum 4 <6.

5. (1,2): count1=3, count2=2 → sum 5 <6.

6. (3,7): count3=2, count7=2 → sum 4 <6.

7. (1,3): sum 3+2=5 <6.

8. (1,4): sum 3+1=4 <6.

None of these pairs have sum >=6. So Invalid_pairs=0.

So the answer is 1-0=1, which matches the sample.

So the approach works for the samples.

Now, the code steps:

Implement the following:

1. Read n and p.

2. For each of the next n lines, read x_i, y_i.

3. Compute count for each a. For each (x, y) in coders, increment count[x] and count[y].

4. Compute overlap: for each (x, y) in coders, create a sorted tuple (min(x, y), max(x, y)), and increment the count in a dictionary.

5. Sort the list of counts (for all a in 1..n) in non-decreasing order.

6. Compute Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p using the two-pointer approach on the sorted counts.

7. Compute Invalid_pairs by iterating over all (a, b) in the overlap dictionary. For each, check if a < b (which they are), and:

   a. Compute sum_ab = count[a] + count[b]

   b. If sum_ab >= p, check if overlap_ab > (sum_ab - p). If yes, increment Invalid_pairs.

8. The answer is Total_pairs_with_sum_ge_p - Invalid_pairs.

Now, code considerations:

- For count, we need a dictionary or array where indices are the a's (which are up to n, which can be 3e5). So use an array of size n+1 (since coders are numbered from 1 to n).

- The coders' pairs x_i and y_i can be up to n.

Implementing steps:

In Python:

But in Python, for n=3e5, using a list for counts is feasible.

But for the overlap, using a defaultdict to count the occurrences of each sorted pair.

But in Python, tuples can be keys in a dictionary.

Now, code steps:

Read n and p.

Initialize count = [0]*(n+1). Because coders are numbered from 1 to n.

overlap = defaultdict(int)

Then, for each of the n lines:

x, y = map(int, input().split())

count[x] +=1

count[y] +=1

a = min(x, y)

b = max(x, y)

overlap[(a, b)] +=1

Then, sorted_counts = sorted(count[1: n+1])

But wait, the count array is 1-based? Because coders are numbered 1 to n. So for a in 1..n, count[a] is the number of times a appears.

So when we take the counts for all a in 1..n, sorted in non-decreasing order.

Once we have sorted_counts, perform two-pointer approach.

Implement two-pointer:

sorted_counts.sort()

n_c = len(sorted_counts) → n.

total_pairs =0

left =0

right =n-1

for left in range(n):

    # find the smallest right where sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >= p and right > left.

    # adjust right as left increases.

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right-1] >= p:

        right -=1

    if sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >= p and right > left:

        total_pairs += (n- right)

    # reset right to n-1 if left >= right?

    if right <= left:

        right = left+1

But wait, the standard two-pointer approach for this problem is:

Initialize right to n-1.

For left in 0 to n-1:

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right-1] >= p:

        right -=1

    if sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >= p:

        total_pairs += (n - right)

    else:

        # no pairs for this left.

But after processing left, the right may have to reset for the next left. However, the two-pointer approach works by moving right only leftwards as left increases. So the code would be:

sorted_counts.sort()

total_pairs =0

right = n-1

for left in range(n):

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >= p:

        right -=1

    # after the loop, right is the first position where the sum is <p.

    # So the minimal position where sum >=p is right+1, but we need to check.

    # Wait, no. The loop condition is: while right>left and sorted[left] + sorted[right-1] >=p.

    # Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the code.

Wait, the correct two-pointer approach is:

Initialize right to n-1.

For left in 0 to n-1:

    while right > left and sorted[left] + sorted[right] >= p:

        right -=1

    # Now, right is the largest index such that sum < p.

    # So the number of elements from right+1 to n-1 is (n-1 - (right+1) +1) = n - right -1.

    # But how to adjust this.

Alternatively, another approach:

After sorting the array, for each left, find the smallest right such that left < right and sorted[left] + sorted[right] >= p. Then the number of pairs for this left is (n- right).

But to find that right efficiently, for each left, we can use a binary search.

But for n=3e5, binary search for each left would be O(n log n), which is acceptable.

So perhaps code:

sorted_counts.sort()

total_pairs =0

for i in range(n):

    a = sorted_counts[i]

    # find the smallest j >i where a + sorted_counts[j] >=p.

    low = i+1

    high = n

    while low < high:

        mid = (low + high) //2

        if mid >=n:

            break

        if a + sorted_counts[mid] >= p:

            high = mid

        else:

            low = mid +1

    j = low

    if j <n:

        total_pairs += (n - j)

But this binary search approach is O(n log n), which for n=3e5 would be acceptable.

But the two-pointer approach is O(n), which is better. So let's implement the two-pointer correctly.

Wait, the correct two-pointer approach would be:

sorted_counts is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Initialize right =n-1.

total_pairs =0

for left in range(n):

    # move right as far left as possible while sum >=p.

    # since array is sorted, for left increasing, right can't increase.

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >=p:

        right -=1

    # Now, if right is left, then check if left < right.

    # So after the loop, sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] <p, or right <=left.

    # but we need to find the first right where sum >=p.

    # the current right is the first where sum <p. So the next right is right +1.

    current_right = right +1

    if current_right >=n:

        continue

    if current_right > left:

        total_pairs += (n - current_right)

So for example, after moving right to the leftmost position where sum <p, the valid positions are from current_right to n-1.

But this needs to be adjusted.

Let's think with an example. sorted_counts is [1,2,3,4,5], p=5.

For left=0 (1):

We want the minimal j>0 where 1 + a[j] >=5. The values are 2,3,4,5.

sum=1+2=3 <5 → j increases. 1+3=4 <5 → j increases. 1+4=5 >=5. So j=3 (index 3, value 4).

So the number of pairs is 5-3=2 (indices 3 and 4).

But using two pointers:

Initialize right=4 (index 4, value5).

left=0.

sum=1+5=6 >=5. So we decrement right to 3 (value4).

sum=1+4=5 >=5 → decrement right to 2 (value3).

sum=1+3=4 <5. So loop stops.

current_right = 2+1=3.

sum is 1+3=4 <5. But current_right is 3. So sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[3] =1+4=5 >=5.

So the number of pairs is (5-3) =2 (indices 3 and4).

Yes.

So the correct code after the loop is:

current_right = right +1

if current_right <=n-1 and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[current_right] >=p:

    total_pairs += (n - current_right)

But how to handle this.

Alternatively, the code should track the minimal right where the sum is >=p. So after the loop, right is the largest index where sum <p, but the next index (right+1) may be a valid sum.

But if after the loop, right is left, then there's no j>left.

So in code:

for left in 0 to n-1:

    # during loop, right is decremented while sum >=p.

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >=p:

        right -=1

    # now, after the loop, right is the largest index <= previous right where sum <p.

    # but the next possible j is right+1.

    # check if right+1 is within bounds and j>left.

    j = right +1

    if j <n and j > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[j] >=p:

        total_pairs += (n - j)

    else:

        # check if right is j=left+1 and sum is >=p.

        # but after the loop, the sum is <p.

        pass

Wait, this seems error-prone.

Alternative approach using two pointers:

Initialize right =n-1.

for left in 0 to n-1:

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >=p:

        right -=1

    # Now, after the loop, right is the largest index where sum <p (if such exists) or right is left.

    # So the number of valid pairs for this left is the number of elements from (right +1) to n-1.

    # Because right is the largest index where sum <p. So elements after right (right+1) may be >=p.

    if right <n-1:

        start = right +1

        if start <=n-1:

            if sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[start] >=p:

                total_pairs += (n - start)

    else:

        # right is n-1, which is j=left+1? Not sure.

        pass

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, using the two-pointer approach correctly:

Initialize right =n-1.

total_pairs =0

for left in range(n):

    # Find the minimal right such that sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >=p.

    # We can start from the previous right.

    # So for left increasing, right can only move left.

    # So we don't reset right for each left.

    # So for each left, we start from the current right, and move left until sum >=p.

    # Wait, no. Because we need to find the minimal right where sum >=p.

    # So for left=0, we start right at n-1 and move left as much as possible.

    # For left=1, we can start right from the previous value.

    # Because array is sorted, as left increases, the minimal right may not decrease.

    # Wait, perhaps the two-pointer approach is:

    # Initialize right to n-1.

    # For each left in 0..n-1:

    #   while right>left and sorted[left] + sorted[right-1] >=p:

    #       right -=1

    #   if sorted[left] + sorted[right] >=p:

    #       total += n - right

    #   else:

    #       # no pairs.

    # But I'm not sure.

    # This is the code from earlier example.

    while right > left and sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right-1] >= p:

        right -=1

    if sorted_counts[left] + sorted_counts[right] >= p and right > left:

        total_pairs += (n - right)

    else:

        # after moving right as left as possible, if sum is still <p, then no pairs.

        pass

But in this case, for left=0, right starts at n-1.

Wait, but initial right is n-1.

Wait, let's take the first sample:

sorted_counts = [1,2,2,3]. n=4.

p=2.

Loop for left=0:

sum =1+3=4 >=2.

We check right-1: 3-1=2. sorted_counts[0] + sorted_counts[2] =1+2=3 >=2. So right decreases to 3-1=3-1=2.

Then check if sorted_counts[0] + sorted_counts[2] >=p → yes. So right becomes 2.

But now right is 2> left=0.

Check sum again: 1+2=3 >=2. Then right decreases to 1.

Check sum 1+2=3 >=2. right becomes 1.

Now, right is 1> left=0.

sum sorted[0] + sorted[1] =1+2=3 >=2 → right decreases to 0.

Now right is not > left. So loop stops.

Then check if sorted[0] + sorted[0] >=p → 1+1=2 >=2, but right ==left → invalid pair (a and b must be different).

So code does not add anything. But in reality, the valid pairs for left=0 are all j>0 where sum >=2.

But according to this code, it's not working.

So perhaps the two-pointer approach is more complex than initially thought.

Given the time constraints, perhaps using the binary search approach is better, even though it's O(n log n), which is acceptable for n=3e5.

So code for binary search:

sorted_counts = sorted(count[a] for a in range(1, n+1))

total_pairs =0

for i in range(n):

    a = sorted_counts[i]

    # find smallest j >i where a + sorted_counts[j] >=p.

    low = i+1

    high =n

    while low <high:

        mid = (low + high)//2

        if a + sorted_counts[mid] >=p:

            high =mid

        else:

            low = mid +1

    j = low

    if j <n:

        total_pairs += (n - j)

This code correctly finds the first j>i where the sum is >=p. The number of elements from j to n-1 is (n-j).

Testing this code with the first sample:

sorted_counts = [1,2,2,3]

For i=0 (a=1):

low=1, high=4.

mid=2 → a=1 + sorted_counts[2]=2 → 3 >=2. high=2.

mid= (1+2)/2=1 → sorted_counts[1]=2 → 1+2=3 >=2. high=1.

Loop ends. j=1. elements from 1 to3 (indexes 1,2,3) → 3 elements. So 3 pairs.

i=1 (a=2):

low=2, high=4.

mid=3 → a=2 + sorted[3]=3 →5 >=2. high=3.

mid= (2+3)/2=2 → a=2 + sorted[2]=2 →4 >=2. high=2.

Loop ends. j=2. elements from 2 to3 → 2 elements. So 2 pairs.

i=2 (a=2):

low=3, high=4.

mid=3 → 2+3=5 >=2. high=3.

loop ends. j=3. elements from 3 →1 pair.

i=3: j=4, which is out of range. So 0.

Total 3+2+1=6. Correct.

So the binary search approach works.

Thus, in code, we'll use the binary search approach.

Now, code:

Now, putting it all together.

Read n and p.

Read n pairs.

Compute count and overlap.

Sort the counts.

Compute total_pairs via binary search.

Compute Invalid_pairs by checking each (a, b) in overlap.

But how to get the count[a] and count[b] for each a and b?

Because count is a list where count[x] is the count for x.

So for a given (a, b) in overlap.keys():

sum_ab = count[a] + count[b]

if sum_ab >=p:

    required_overlap = sum_ab - p

    if overlap[(a,b)] > required_overlap:

        Invalid_pairs +=1

So code:

invalid =0

for (a, b), cnt in overlap.items():

    sum_ab = count[a] + count[b]

    if sum_ab >= p:

        required = sum_ab - p

        if cnt > required:

            invalid +=1

ans = total_pairs - invalid

print(ans)

Now, code in Python:

But note that in Python, dictionaries are iterated over keys and values. So overlap is a defaultdict(int), and items() gives (key, value).

But in code, count is a list where count[x] is the count for x.

Now, the code.

But wait, the count array is built correctly:

count = [0]*(n+1)  # indices 0 to n.

Then, for each x, y in the input:

count[x] +=1

count[y] +=1

So count[1] is the count for 1, etc.

So yes.

Now, let's write the code.

But for handling large n=3e5, in Python, this is feasible.

The code:

import sys
from bisect import bisect_left

n, p = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
count = [0] * (n + 1)
overlap = dict()  # keys are sorted tuples (a, b), values are counts.

for _ in range(n):
    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    count[x] += 1
    count[y] += 1
    a = min(x, y)
    b = max(x, y)
    key = (a, b)
    if key in overlap:
        overlap[key] += 1
    else:
        overlap[key] = 1

sorted_counts = sorted(count[1:n+1])

total_pairs = 0

for i in range(n):
    a = sorted_counts[i]
    # Find the smallest j > i such that a + sorted_counts[j] >= p
    target = p - a
    j = bisect_left(sorted_counts, target, i + 1, n)
    total_pairs += (n - j)

invalid = 0
for (a, b), cnt in overlap.items():
    sum_ab = count[a] + count[b]
    if sum_ab >= p:
        required = sum_ab - p
        if cnt > required:
            invalid += 1

print(total_pairs - invalid)

Wait, but the bisect_left approach for finding j is different.

Wait, the bisect_left function finds the first index j >= i+1 where sorted_counts[j] >= target.

Because sum_ab = a + sorted_counts[j] >= p → sorted_counts[j] >= p -a.

So j is the first index where sorted_counts[j] >= (p - a).

But this is correct because once sorted_counts[j] >= (p -a), then a + sorted_counts[j] >= p.

Yes.

So this code works.

Testing with sample 1:

sorted_counts = [1,2,2,3]

For i=0 (a=1), target =2-1=1. So bisect_left finds the first j>0 where sorted_counts[j] >=1. All elements are >=1. So j=1. n-j =4-1=3 → adds 3.

Similarly for other i's.

Sample 2:

count after processing is [0,3,2,2,1,3,2,2,1]. sorted_counts is [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]. For p=6, each i from 0-7:

i=0 (a=1), target=6-1=5 → find j>0 where sorted_counts[j] >=5. The sorted_counts are [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]. The first j where sorted_counts[j] >=5 is 8 (out of range). So adds 0.

i=1 (a=1), target=5 → same.

i=2 (a=2), target=4 → sorted_counts[j] >=4. The first j is 6 (value3). 8-6=2.

But sum_ab=2+3=5 <6. So why is this counted? Wait, the code adds (n-j) which is 8-6=2. But 2+3=5 <6. So why?

Ah, because the code is using bisect_left to find sorted_counts[j] >= (p -a).

But p is 6. For a=2, target=6-2=4. The code finds j=6, sorted_counts[6] is3. 3 >=4? No. So this is a problem.

Wait, no. For a=2, the target is 6-2=4. So we are looking for sorted_counts[j] >=4. But in the sorted_counts array, the largest value is 3. So bisect_left returns 8 (since all elements are <4). So j=8, which is out of range, so adds 0.

Hmm, this suggests that the code is incorrect.

But in sample 2, the code should compute total_pairs =1.

But let's see:

sorted_counts = [1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3]

n=8.

For i=6 (a=3):

target=6-3=3. Find j>6 (since i=6). j starts at7. sorted_counts[7] is3, which is >=3. So j=7. n-j=8-7=1. So adds 1.

For i=7 (a=3): j>7 is not possible. Adds 0.

So total_pairs is 1.

Which is correct.

But how?

The code for i=6 (a=3):

sorted_counts[i] =3.

target =6-3=3.

bisect_left looks for the first j>6 where sorted_counts[j] >=3.

The elements from j=7 to7 (since n=8):

sorted_counts[7] is3 >=3. So j=7.

n-j =8-7=1.

So total_pairs +=1.

Yes.

So the code works.

So for the second sample, the code correctly computes total_pairs=1.

Thus, the code is correct.
