<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the city's towers non-decreasing in height. Each operation allows us to merge a tower with a neighboring one, and this reduces the count of towers by one each time. So the goal is to merge some towers such that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing, and we need the fewest possible merges.

Hmm. So the key here is to model how merging affects the sequence. Let's think about what the final arrangement could look like. Each tower in the final sequence is a sum of some consecutive original towers. Because each merge operation combines adjacent towers. So the problem reduces to partitioning the original array into consecutive segments, where the sum of each segment is non-decreasing, and the number of segments is maximized. Because the number of operations is (original n) minus the number of segments. So the more segments we can have (each forming a non-decreasing sequence), the fewer operations we need.

So the problem is equivalent to finding the longest possible sequence of consecutive merged segments where each segment's sum is >= the previous one. And then subtract the length of this sequence from n to get the minimum operations.

So the approach is to find the maximum possible k (number of segments) such that the sum of each segment is non-decreasing. Then the answer is n - k.

Now, how to compute this? This seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think of dp[i] as the maximum number of segments we can form up to index i (0-based?), such that the last segment's sum is as small as possible. Wait, maybe we need to track for each position i and possible sum s, the maximum number of segments. But since the sum can be up to 1e5*5000 = 5e8, tracking sums directly isn't feasible.

Alternative approach: For each position i, find the earliest j where the sum from j to i is >= the sum of the previous segment. But how to structure this.

Let's think of building the segments from left to right. For each i, we can track the maximum number of segments up to i (call it dp[i]) and the sum of the last segment in that optimal configuration. Then, for each i, we can look back to some j < i, compute the sum from j+1 to i, and check if this sum is >= the last segment's sum up to j. If yes, then dp[i] = dp[j] + 1, and the last sum would be the sum from j+1 to i.

But the problem is that for each i, there might be multiple j's that could lead to a valid configuration, but we need to choose the one that allows the maximum number of segments.

Wait, but how to track this efficiently. The DP approach would be O(n^2), which for n=5000 is 25 million operations. That's manageable within 2 seconds, perhaps.

So here's the plan:

We can compute a DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum number of segments possible when considering the first i elements. For each i, we can look for all j < i, and check if the sum of elements from j+1 to i is >= the sum of the last segment in dp[j]. Then, among all possible j's that satisfy this, the maximum dp[j] +1 is dp[i]. However, keeping track of the sum of the last segment for each possible j is necessary.

But how to track that? Because for each j, the sum of the last segment in the optimal partition up to j could vary. So for each i, we need to track not just the maximum number of segments up to i, but also the sum of the last segment in that configuration.

So perhaps the DP state should be (i, sum_last), but this is not feasible. Instead, for each i, we can keep track of the minimal possible sum of the last segment when the number of segments is maximized. Because for a given i, if we have two different j's that can reach the same number of segments, but different last sums, the one with the smaller sum is better, as it allows more possibilities for the next segments.

So here's the approach:

We can have two arrays:

- dp[i]: the maximum number of segments up to index i (0-based or 1-based? Let's say 1-based for the original array)
- last_sum[i]: the minimal possible sum of the last segment in the optimal partition (with dp[i] segments) up to index i.

Then, for each i, we look back at j from i-1 down to 0 (or some lower bound), compute the sum s = sum(h[j+1..i]). For each j, if s >= last_sum[j], then we can consider updating dp[i] to be max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1), and track the minimal possible last_sum[i] for that dp[i].

Wait, but for each i, there might be multiple j's that can give the same dp[j] +1. Among those j's, the one with the minimal s would be better, but actually, the sum s is fixed as the sum from j+1 to i. So for each i, we need to find the j with the maximum dp[j] such that the sum from j+1 to i is >= last_sum[j]. Then, for that j, the dp[i] would be dp[j] +1, and the last_sum[i] would be sum(j+1..i).

Alternatively, for each i, we can iterate j from i-1 down to 0, compute the sum from j+1 to i, and check if this sum is >= last_sum[j]. If yes, then we can take dp[j] +1 and see if it's better than the current dp[i]. However, once we find such a j, we can break early because the sum increases as j decreases (since we're adding more elements). Wait, no. Because j is from i-1 down to 0. For example, j = i-1 gives sum h[i], j = i-2 gives sum h[i-1] + h[i], etc. So the sum increases as j decreases. So the sum from j+1 to i is larger as j decreases.

So, for a given i, the sum s for j is the sum of h[j+1 ... i]. So when j is smaller (j approaches 0), the sum is larger. So the first j (starting from i-1 down to 0) where s >= last_sum[j] would give the maximum possible dp[i], but perhaps there's a j further left (i.e., j is smaller) that allows for a higher dp[j] +1.

Wait, no. Because dp[j] could be higher for j closer to i. For example, suppose for j1 < j2, dp[j1] is 3 and dp[j2] is 2. Then if the sum from j1+1 to i is >= last_sum[j1], then dp[i] would be 4. Whereas if the sum from j2+1 to i is >= last_sum[j2], then dp[i] would be 3. So we need to find the j that gives the maximum dp[j] +1.

But how to do that efficiently. Because for each i, checking all possible j's from 0 to i-1 is O(n^2), which for n=5000 is 25 million steps. But that's manageable.

Alternatively, for each i, we can precompute the prefix sums. Let's compute prefix_sum[i], the sum of the first i elements. Then, the sum from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j].

So for each i, we can compute for all j < i, the sum s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]. For each j, if s >= last_sum[j], then we can consider dp[j] + 1.

But even with this, for each i, we have to check all j's from 0 to i-1, which is O(n^2) time.

Hmm. Let's see for n=5000, 5000^2 is 25 million. Each iteration is simple: a subtraction and a comparison. So maybe this is manageable.

But can we optimize this? Let's think.

For each i, we need to find the maximum dp[j] such that prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= last_sum[j]. Rearranging, prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]. Let's denote for each j, the value of prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j] as a threshold. Then, for each i, we need to find all j where prefix_sum[i] >= threshold_j, and among those j's, take the one with the largest dp[j].

But how to find such j's quickly. If we can precompute the thresholds and for each i, find the j with the maximum dp[j] where threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], that would be O(n log n) time. But for that, the thresholds must be ordered in a way that allows binary search.

Wait, but the thresholds (prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]) for j=0,1,...,i-1 may not be in any particular order. So binary search might not be possible.

Alternatively, for each j, the threshold_j is equal to prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]. However, last_sum[j] is the sum of the last segment in the optimal partition up to j, which is the sum of the j-th segment. So, for example, if the optimal partition up to j is of k segments, then the sum of the last segment is sum of the j's segment. So, the threshold_j is prefix_sum[j] (sum up to j) plus the last_sum[j], which is the sum of the last segment. Wait, no. Because the last_sum[j] is the sum of the last segment in the partition up to j. So the prefix_sum[j] is the sum of all elements up to j. But the partition into segments up to j would have some sum for the last segment. So the prefix_sum[j] is equal to the sum of all segments up to j. But the last_sum[j] is the sum of the last segment. So prefix_sum[j] = sum_1 + sum_2 + ... + sum_k, where sum_k is last_sum[j]. So the threshold is prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j] = sum_1 + ... + sum_k + sum_k. Which is sum_1 + ... + sum_{k} + sum_{k} = sum_1 + ... + sum_{k-1} + 2 sum_k.

But how does this relate to anything? Maybe not helpful.

So perhaps the initial approach of O(n^2) DP is the way to go. Let's outline the steps.

Initialize:

- prefix_sum[0] = 0
- prefix_sum[i] = h[0] + ... + h[i-1] (assuming 0-based for the array h)

For the DP:

- dp[0] = 0, last_sum[0] = 0 (since zero elements)
- For each i from 1 to n:
   max_segs = 0
   best_last_sum = infinity
   for j from 0 to i-1:
       s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]  // sum of j+1 to i elements
       if s >= last_sum[j]:
           if dp[j] + 1 > max_segs or (dp[j] +1 == max_segs and s < best_last_sum):
               max_segs = dp[j] +1
               best_last_sum = s
   dp[i] = max_segs
   last_sum[i] = best_last_sum

Wait, but for j from 0 to i-1, we need to check all possible j's and find the one that gives the maximum dp[j] +1. If multiple j's give the same dp[j] +1, we choose the one with the smallest possible s (since that would allow more possibilities in the next steps). Because a smaller s for the last segment would make it easier for the next segments to be >= s.

So for each i, after considering all j's, we take the maximum dp[j] +1, and among those j's that give this maximum, we take the minimal possible s (sum from j+1 to i) as the last_sum[i].

This way, when processing the next i, we have the best possible last_sum to allow for more segments.

But for each i, this is O(n) time, leading to O(n^2) overall.

But for n=5000, this is 25 million operations. Each iteration is checking a j, computing s, comparing with last_sum[j], and tracking the max and best last_sum.

But in Python, 25 million operations may be tight. So we need to optimize as much as possible.

Let's think about possible optimizations.

First, precompute the prefix sums. Then, for each i, iterate j from i-1 down to 0, and compute s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]. For each j, check if s >= last_sum[j]. If so, then see if this j gives a better (or equal) count than the current max. Since when j decreases (i.e., moving leftwards), s increases, once we find a j that gives a certain dp[j] +1, any j' < j would have a larger s, but could potentially have a higher dp[j'].

Wait, but for j' < j, the s is larger (since sum from j' to i is more than j to i). So even if j' gives a higher dp[j'] +1, but the s is larger. So perhaps once we find a j that gives a certain dp[j] +1, and if we can't find a higher dp[j] +1 by moving to j' < j, then we can break early.

But how to know if moving left would find a higher dp[j'] +1?

Alternatively, since we are looking for the maximum dp[j] +1, perhaps we can iterate j from 0 to i-1, but track the maximum dp[j] and check if the sum is >= last_sum[j]. But that's not helpful.

Wait, here's another idea. For each i, the maximum possible dp[i] is the maximum dp[j] +1 where s >= last_sum[j]. So for each i, we can iterate j in decreasing order (from i-1 down to 0). For each j, compute s and check if s >= last_sum[j]. Once we find a j where dp[j] +1 is equal to the current maximum possible (which could be, say, the maximum possible for i), then we can break early. But how to know what the maximum possible is.

Alternatively, since dp[j] can be up to j (since each element is a segment by itself if possible), then for j from i-1 down to 0, the maximum possible dp[j] is i-1 - j (if all segments are individual). But that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the earliest j where s >= last_sum[j] and dp[j] is as large as possible.

Alternatively, the optimal j for i is the one with the largest possible dp[j], and s >= last_sum[j]. So for each i, the optimal j is the one that has the largest dp[j] and sum from j+1 to i >= last_sum[j].

So perhaps for each i, we can track the maximum dp[j] and then find the rightmost j where the condition holds.

But I'm not sure how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, for each j, precompute the minimum i where prefix_sum[i] >= threshold_j. But I'm not sure.

Another optimization: for each i, precompute the j in a way that reduces the number of checks.

But maybe the O(n^2) approach is the best we can do here.

So, let's outline the code.

First, compute the prefix sums. Then, for each i from 1 to n (since the original array is of length n), compute dp[i] as the maximum possible segments up to i. Then, the answer is n - dp[n], since dp[n] is the maximum number of segments possible, and each operation reduces the number of towers by 1.

Wait, let's clarify:

Original n towers. Each merge reduces the number of towers by 1. The number of operations is (original n) - (final number of towers). So the minimum operations is n - k, where k is the maximum possible number of segments in the non-decreasing sequence.

Yes.

So the code would be:

Compute the prefix sums.

Initialize dp[0] = 0, last_sum[0] = 0.

For i in 1 to n:

   current_max = 0

   best_sum = infinity

   for j in 0 to i-1:

       s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

       if s >= last_sum[j]:

           if dp[j] + 1 > current_max or (dp[j] +1 == current_max and s < best_sum):

               current_max = dp[j] +1

               best_sum = s

   dp[i] = current_max

   last_sum[i] = best_sum

The answer is n - dp[n]

But for example, in the first sample input:

5

8 2 7 3 1

The prefix sums would be [0, 8, 10, 17, 20, 21].

Then, let's see:

For i=1 (h[0] is 8):

Check j=0:

sum is 8-0 =8. Check if 8 >= last_sum[0] (0). Yes.

dp[j] is 0, so current_max is 1. best_sum is 8.

So dp[1] =1, last_sum[1]=8.

For i=2 (sum is 10):

Check j=0:

sum is 10-0=10. Compare with last_sum[0] (0). Yes. dp[j]+1 is 1. current_max is 1. sum is 10. Then j=1: sum is 10-8=2. Check 2 >= last_sum[1] (8). No. So only j=0 is valid. So dp[2]=1, last_sum=10.

But wait, maybe j=1. sum is 2. last_sum[j=1] is 8. 2 <8, so no. So only j=0 is possible. So for i=2, dp is 1, sum 10.

But perhaps the correct partition is [8,2+7=9] which sum 8 and 9. So two segments. But according to the code, this is not possible.

Wait, maybe the code is missing something. Let's see.

Wait, for i=2, the sum is 8+2=10.

Wait, for j=1 (sum from j+1=1 to i=2 is sum of 2, which is 2. The last_sum[j=1] is 8. So 2 >=8 is false. So no.

So the code for i=2 would have dp[2] =1, sum 10.

But the correct maximum segments here is 1. Because the two towers are 8 and 2, which is not non-decreasing. So we have to merge them. So the code is correct.

Then, for i=3, sum 17.

Check j from 0 to 2.

j=0: sum is 17-0=17. last_sum[0] is 0. So yes. dp[j] is 0. So dp is 1.

j=1: sum is 17-8=9. last_sum[1] is 8. 9 >=8: yes. dp[j=1] is 1. So dp[j]+1 is 2. So current_max is 2, sum is9.

j=2: sum is 17-10=7. last_sum[j=2] is10. 7 <10: no.

So for i=3, dp[3] =2, sum=9.

Which corresponds to [8,2+7=9]. So two segments. The sum array is 8,9 which is non-decreasing. So this is correct.

So the code seems to be working.

But for the first sample input, the code should compute dp[5] as 2, which would imply the answer is 5-2=3. But the correct answer is 3. Wait, no. Wait, the first sample input is:

Original towers: 8,2,7,3,1.

The answer is 3 operations, which leaves 5-3=2 towers. Wait, no. Wait, the answer is 3 operations. So the final number of towers is 5-3=2. But according to the code, dp[5] would be 2, so answer 5-2=3. That's correct.

So let's proceed.

But how to code this efficiently in Python.

First, compute the prefix sums. Then, for each i in 1..n, we need to loop j from 0 to i-1.

But for n=5000, this is O(n^2) operations, which is 25 million. In Python, each loop iteration is a bit slow, but maybe manageable with some optimizations.

But perhaps we can precompute the prefix sum array, and use a list for dp and last_sum.

So let's code this.

In Python:

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))
prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)
for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + h[i]

dp = [0]*(n+1)
last_sum = [0]*(n+1)

dp[0] = 0
last_sum[0] = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    max_segs = 0
    best_s = float('inf')
    for j in range(i):
        s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]
        if s >= last_sum[j]:
            current = dp[j] + 1
            if current > max_segs or (current == max_segs and s < best_s):
                max_segs = current
                best_s = s
    dp[i] = max_segs
    last_sum[i] = best_s

print(n - dp[n])

Wait, but for j in 0 to i-1 (since in Python, range(i) is 0..i-1). So for i in 1..n, j runs from 0 to i-1.

But for n=5000, this is 5000*5000=25 million iterations. In Python, this may be slow. For example, 25 million loops in Python can take around 5 seconds, but the time limit is 2 seconds. So this code may not pass the time constraints.

Hmm. So we need to optimize this.

What's the bottleneck here? The inner loop.

Let's think: for each i, we can iterate j from i-1 down to 0. Since the sum s increases as j decreases (since the sum from j+1 to i is larger when j is smaller). So perhaps once we find a j that gives the maximum possible dp[j] +1, we can break early.

But how?

For example, if we can find the j that gives the maximum dp[j] +1, and since as j decreases, s increases, the first j (when iterating from i-1 down to 0) that allows s >= last_sum[j] and has the maximum dp[j] +1, we can take that j and break.

But how to find that j.

Alternatively, track the maximum possible dp[j] +1. Let's suppose that the current maximum is m. Then, as we iterate j from i-1 down to 0, once we find a j where dp[j] +1 == m and s >= last_sum[j], then there's no need to check j's further left (since dp[j] +1 can't be larger than m, but even if another j' has the same m, the s would be larger, which may not be better, but we need the minimal s for the same m).

Wait, but for the same m, we need the minimal s. So when iterating j from i-1 down to 0, the first j that gives dp[j] +1 == m and s >= last_sum[j], the s would be the largest possible for that m. So that's not helpful. But we need the minimal s. So perhaps we need to iterate j from 0 up to i-1, and track the minimal s for the maximum m.

But that's not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, the maximum possible dp[j] +1 is the maximum of dp[j] for j < i, where s >= last_sum[j]. So if we can find the j with the maximum dp[j] such that s >= last_sum[j], then that's the best j.

But how to do that.

Another idea: for each j, track the maximum possible dp[j], and precompute for each j the threshold (prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]).

Because s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= last_sum[j] → prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j].

So for each i, we need to find all j < i where prefix_sum[i] >= threshold_j, and among them, select the j with the maximum dp[j]. Then, dp[i] = dp[j] + 1.

If we can find the j with the maximum dp[j] where threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], then that's the optimal j.

So, the problem reduces to, for each i, find the j with the maximum dp[j] where threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], and j < i.

But how to do this efficiently.

If we can maintain a data structure that allows us to query for the maximum dp[j] where threshold_j <= x, and x is the current prefix_sum[i], then this can be done in O(log n) per query.

But how to build such a data structure.

The thresholds are not necessarily sorted. So if we can keep them in a sorted order, we can perform binary search. But since j can be up to i-1, and thresholds can be arbitrary, this is not possible.

Alternatively, we can process the j's in the order of increasing threshold_j, and for a given i, use binary search to find all j's with threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i]. But even then, finding the maximum dp[j] among them requires a range maximum query structure.

So the idea is to precompute a list of j's sorted by threshold_j, and for each prefix_sum[i], find the j's with threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], and among them find the maximum dp[j].

But this would require building a structure that allows for this query. This can be done with a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) or a segment tree, but the keys (threshold_j) need to be coordinate-compressed.

But the thresholds can be up to (sum of all elements) * 2. Let's see:

sum of elements is up to 5000 * 1e5 = 5e8. So threshold_j can be up to (sum up to j) + last_sum[j] (which is sum of some segment up to j). So threshold_j could be up to (5e8) * 2 = 1e9. So coordinate compression would require sorting all the thresholds and mapping them to indices.

But for n=5000, this would require 5000 elements. So it's manageable.

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute all threshold_j = prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j] for j from 0 to n.

2. Sort all unique thresholds and assign a coordinate to each.

3. For each i, compute x = prefix_sum[i]. Then, find all j's where threshold_j <= x. Among these j's, find the maximum dp[j], and the corresponding j.

4. The dp[i] would then be this maximum dp[j] + 1.

But to do this, we need to process the j's in a way that allows us to query for the maximum dp[j] up to x.

This can be done with a segment tree or a Fenwick tree that is built over the sorted thresholds. For each j, when processed, we insert threshold_j into the structure and keep track of the maximum dp[j] up to that threshold.

But since the thresholds may not be sorted in increasing order as j increases, we can't process them incrementally. So perhaps we need to precompute all threshold_j, sort them, build a static structure, and then for each query, use binary search to find the relevant thresholds.

Alternatively, during processing, we can maintain a list of (threshold_j, dp[j]) pairs, and for each new j, we insert this into a sorted list. Then, for each i, perform a binary search to find all threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], and find the maximum dp[j] in that range. However, inserting into a sorted list is O(n) per insertion, leading to O(n^2) time again.

Hmm. So this seems challenging.

Another approach: For each j, track threshold_j. For each i, we can iterate j from i-1 down to 0, and compute threshold_j. If threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], then we can consider dp[j]. Once we find the first j (starting from i-1) where threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i], then since the threshold_j's for j < current j can be higher or lower, but the sum s (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) is larger, perhaps there's a better j with higher dp[j].

Alternatively, for each i, the maximum dp[j] for j < i where threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i] is the maximum possible. So if we can find this maximum efficiently.

But how?

An alternative idea inspired by the problem's constraints: since each threshold_j is a sum of prefix_sum[j] and last_sum[j], and last_sum[j] is a sum of a segment in the optimal partition up to j. Which is non-decreasing. So, for the optimal partition, the last_sum[j] is non-decreasing. Because the segments are non-decreasing.

Wait, yes! Because the partition is non-decreasing, the last_sum[j] is >= the previous last_sum. So the last_sum array is non-decreasing. Because each segment in the partition must be >= the previous one.

So, last_sum[j] is non-decreasing. So for j1 < j2, last_sum[j1] <= last_sum[j2].

Wait, because when processing j2, the last_sum[j2] is the sum of the last segment in the partition up to j2, which is >= the sum of the last segment in the partition up to j1 (if j1 < j2). Because the partition up to j2 must be non-decreasing.

So the last_sum array is non-decreasing. Therefore, the thresholds array (threshold_j = prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]) is also non-decreasing.

Because:

threshold_j = prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]

prefix_sum[j] is increasing (since elements are positive), and last_sum[j] is non-decreasing. So threshold_j is also increasing.

Because prefix_sum[j] increases by h[j], and last_sum[j] is non-decreasing.

Wait, but j can be any index. So if j increases by 1, prefix_sum[j] increases by h[j], and last_sum[j] could be greater than or equal to last_sum[j-1]. So threshold_j increases by at least h[j] + (last_sum[j] - last_sum[j-1]). Since h[j] is positive, threshold_j is strictly increasing.

Because prefix_sum is strictly increasing (since h[j] is at least 1), and last_sum[j] is non-decreasing, then threshold_j is strictly increasing.

So, threshold_j is a strictly increasing sequence.

This is a crucial insight. Because this allows us to process j in order of increasing threshold_j, which is the same as j in order of increasing index. So for any j1 < j2, threshold_j1 < threshold_j2.

This means that for a given x (prefix_sum[i]), the j's that satisfy threshold_j <= x form a prefix of the j's. Because the threshold_j is strictly increasing, all j's up to a certain k will have threshold_j <= x, and j's after k will have threshold_j >x.

Thus, for each i, the j's that can be considered are those up to the largest j where threshold_j <= x. And among those j's, we need to find the one with the maximum dp[j].

Since the j's are ordered by increasing threshold_j, the maximum j that satisfies threshold_j <= x is the largest j where threshold_j <= x. But since we need the maximum dp[j] among all j's up to that point, perhaps we can track the maximum dp[j] up to each j.

Wait, but even if we have j_max where threshold_j_max <= x, the maximum dp[j] could be somewhere before j_max. For example, j_max has a dp[j_max] that is smaller than some j_prev < j_max.

But since we need the maximum dp[j] among all j's where threshold_j <= x, and j's are processed in order of increasing j, we can precompute a prefix maximum array. For each j, track the maximum dp[j'] for j' from 0 to j. Then, for a given x, find the largest j where threshold_j <= x, and the maximum dp[j'] up to j is the maximum in the prefix up to j.

But how to find the largest j where threshold_j <= x.

Because the thresholds are strictly increasing, we can binary search for x in the thresholds array. The largest j where threshold_j <= x is the rightmost j in the array where threshold_j <=x.

Once we find that j, the maximum dp[j'] up to j is the maximum in the prefix up to j.

But how to track the maximum dp up to each j.

We can maintain an array max_dp_up_to[j], which is the maximum dp[0..j]. Then, for a given j_max found via binary search, the maximum dp is max_dp_up_to[j_max].

But how to compute max_dp_up_to[j]. Since max_dp_up_to[j] = max(max_dp_up_to[j-1], dp[j]).

Yes. So this array can be computed in O(n) time.

So here's the new approach:

Compute for each j, threshold_j = prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j].

Since threshold_j is strictly increasing, we can binary search for x = prefix_sum[i] in the thresholds array to find the maximum j where threshold_j <=x. Then, the maximum dp[j'] up to j is max_dp_up_to[j].

Then, dp[i] = max_dp_up_to[j] +1.

But we also need to track the minimal s (sum from j+1 to i) for the best j. Wait, no. Because for j_max found via binary search, the maximum dp[j'] is the maximum up to j_max. But the j that gives this maximum may not be j_max, but some j_prev <=j_max. But since the threshold_j_prev <=x, it's allowed.

But once we find the maximum possible dp[j], we can choose any j' that contributes to this maximum. However, for the purpose of computing last_sum[i], we need to choose the j' that gives the minimal s. Because the minimal s will allow for more possibilities in the future.

So the problem is that even if we find the maximum possible dp[j], there may be multiple j's with that same maximum. Among those, the one with the minimal s (sum from j+1 to i) would be better for future steps.

So this approach of using binary search and a prefix maximum allows us to find the maximum possible dp[j], but we still need to find the minimal s among all j's that contribute to this maximum.

But how to track this.

This complicates things, because the previous approach required checking all j's to find the minimal s for the maximum dp[j].

But perhaps with this new approach, we can find the maximum dp[j] +1 quickly, but still need to find the minimal s among the j's that have dp[j] == max_dp and threshold_j <=x.

But how?

This seems like a separate problem. For example, suppose that after finding the maximum possible dp[j] (call it m), we need to find the minimal s among all j where dp[j] = m-1 and threshold_j <=x.

But even with this, it's not clear how to proceed.

So maybe the initial approach of O(n^2) is the best way, but with some optimizations.

Let's think again about the initial code.

In the first sample input, the code correctly computes the answer. But for n=5000, in Python, the code may be too slow.

Another optimization idea: precompute the prefix_sum array once, and during the inner loop, compute s as prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j], and compare with last_sum[j]. But since in Python, list accesses are fast, perhaps this is manageable.

But for 25 million iterations, even with each iteration being a few operations, it's possible to take too long.

Alternative idea: precompute the threshold_j for each j, and store them in a list. Then, during the inner loop for j in 0 to i-1, compute the threshold_j and check if it's <= prefix_sum[i].

But since the threshold_j is prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j], which is stored in a list.

So threshold = [prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j] for j in range(n+1)]

Then, for each i, during the inner loop over j, compute if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i]. If yes, then check if s (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) >= last_sum[j].

Wait, no. Because threshold[j] is prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]. So if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i], then prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j] → s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= last_sum[j]. So the condition s >= last_sum[j] is automatically satisfied.

Ah! This is a key point.

Because threshold_j is prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]. So for j to be considered, threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i] implies that s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= last_sum[j]. So the condition s >= last_sum[j] is equivalent to threshold_j <= prefix_sum[i].

So, during the inner loop, for j in 0 to i-1:

if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i], then s >= last_sum[j], so the condition is satisfied.

Thus, we can replace the inner loop's condition check with threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

This simplifies the condition, but how does this help?

Now, the problem reduces to, for each i, find j in 0..i-1 where threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i], and among those j's, select the one with the maximum dp[j], and among those, the one with minimal s (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]).

But since the threshold_j is strictly increasing, for each i, there is a maximum j where threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i]. Let's call this j_max.

So j_max is the largest j <i where threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

And since the threshold array is strictly increasing, j_max can be found via binary search.

Then, all j's from 0 to j_max are valid (since their thresholds are <= prefix_sum[i]).

Among these j's, we need to find the one with the maximum dp[j], and the minimal s (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) if there are ties.

But the minimal s is achieved by the largest j possible, since prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] is minimal when j is largest (since prefix_sum is increasing). So for j in 0 to j_max, the largest j that has the maximum dp[j] will give the minimal s.

So the steps are:

For each i:

1. Compute j_max via binary search on the threshold array (for j <i) to find the largest j where threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

2. Among j=0 to j_max, find the j with the maximum dp[j].

3. Among those j's with maximum dp[j], choose the largest j (to minimize s).

Then, dp[i] = max_dp +1, and last_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j], and threshold[i] = prefix_sum[i] + last_sum[i].

So, how to find the maximum dp[j] in the range j=0..j_max.

We can precompute a prefix maximum array for dp. Let's create an array max_dp where max_dp[j] is the maximum dp[0..j]. Then, for a given j_max, the maximum dp[j] is max_dp[j_max].

But there could be multiple j's in 0..j_max with dp[j] = max_dp[j_max]. Among them, we want the largest j, since that would give the smallest s.

So the approach is:

For each i:

- Compute j_max via binary search.

- The maximum dp in 0..j_max is max_dp[j_max].

- Find the largest j in 0..j_max where dp[j] == max_dp[j_max].

- Then, set dp[i] = max_dp[j_max] + 1.

- last_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j].

- threshold[i] = prefix_sum[i] + last_sum[i].

So, to implement this, we need to precompute:

1. The threshold array.

2. The max_dp array.

3. For each j_max, find the largest j where dp[j] == max_dp[j_max].

This requires another data structure. For example, for each possible value of dp[j], track the largest j where dp[j] is equal to that value, up to j_max.

But this can be precomputed with an array that, for each j, tracks the last occurrence of each dp value.

Alternatively, during preprocessing, for each j, we can track for each possible dp value, the maximum j where dp[j] is that value.

But this is not feasible for large dp values.

An alternative approach is to binary search within the j_max range for the largest j where dp[j] equals max_dp[j_max].

But since j_max can be up to i-1 (which is up to 5000), and for each i this would be a linear scan from j_max down to 0, checking if dp[j] equals the maximum. However, this would be O(n) per i, leading to O(n^2) again.

But if the max_dp[j_max] is known, and j_max is found via binary search, then perhaps the largest j in 0..j_max with dp[j] == max_dp[j_max] can be found by iterating from j_max down to 0 and checking.

But in the worst case, this is O(n) per i, leading to O(n^2) time.

So the total time would be O(n log n) for the binary search steps, plus O(n^2) for the linear searches. Which for n=5000 is 25 million steps, which is still too slow.

So perhaps this approach isn't better than the original O(n^2) approach.

But what if the max_dp array is strictly increasing? Then, the maximum dp[j] in the range 0..j_max is max_dp[j_max], and the j that achieved this is j_max. Because if the max_dp array is strictly increasing, then the last j in the range will have the maximum dp[j].

But is this the case?

Yes! Because if the maximum dp[j] up to j is stored in max_dp[j], and since dp[j] can be up to j (each segment is a single tower), and the max_dp[j] is non-decreasing. But why would max_dp be strictly increasing?

Not necessarily. For example, if a new j does not contribute to a higher dp than previous j's.

But in our case, since threshold_j is strictly increasing, for j+1, threshold[j+1] is higher than threshold[j]. So, the maximum j_max for i = j+1 would be j+1 itself, assuming prefix_sum[i] >= threshold[j+1]. But not necessarily.

But this line of thinking may not be helpful.

Another idea: since threshold_j is strictly increasing, and the prefix_sum[i] increases with i, when processing i+1, the j_max for i+1 is likely larger than or equal to the j_max for i.

But again, this may not help directly.

Perhaps the best way to proceed is to implement the original O(n^2) approach and see if it passes. But in Python, 25 million iterations might be too slow.

Let's see the sample code for the first example.

Sample 1:

n=5, h=[8,2,7,3,1]

prefix_sum: [0,8,10,17,20,21]

threshold is computed as prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j].

For j=0, threshold[0] =0 +0=0.

j=1: prefix_sum[1] =8, last_sum[1] =8 → threshold 8+8=16.

j=2: prefix_sum=10, last_sum=10 → threshold 20.

j=3: prefix_sum=17, last_sum=9 → threshold 17+9=26.

j=4: prefix_sum=20, last_sum=9+3=12? Wait, not sure. Need to compute.

But the threshold array is strictly increasing.

For each i, the code's inner loop checks j's in 0..i-1 where threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

So for i=5, prefix_sum[i] is 21. The threshold array up to j=4 is [0, 16, 20, 26, ...].

So j_max for i=5 is the largest j where threshold[j] <=21. Let's see:

j=0:0 <=21 yes.

j=1:16 <=21 yes.

j=2:20 <=21 yes.

j=3:26 <=21 no.

j=4: threshold[j] is prefix_sum[4] + last_sum[4]. Let's see:

For j=4, prefix_sum[4] is 20. last_sum[4] is the sum of the segment up to j=4. Let's see how the code proceeds.

But perhaps this approach can be optimized with binary search.

So here's the plan:

- Precompute the threshold array.

- For each i, perform a binary search to find j_max, the largest j <i such that threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

- Then, among j's from 0 to j_max, find the j with the maximum dp[j], and the largest j in case of ties.

This j would be the optimal j for i.

Then, dp[i] = dp[j] +1.

last_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j].

threshold[i] = prefix_sum[i] + last_sum[i].

So the steps are:

1. Precompute prefix_sum.

2. Initialize dp[0] =0, last_sum[0] =0, threshold[0] =0.

3. For i from 1 to n:

   a. Compute x = prefix_sum[i].

   b. Perform binary search on threshold[0...i-1] to find the largest j where threshold[j] <=x. This gives j_max.

   c. Among j in 0...j_max, find the j with the maximum dp[j]. If there are multiple j's with the same dp[j], choose the largest j (since that gives the minimal s).

   d. If no such j exists (j_max is -1), then we can't form any segments. But according to the problem statement, the initial array can be merged into one segment, but that's not possible here.

   e. Set dp[i] = dp[j] +1.

   f. Set last_sum[i] = x - prefix_sum[j].

   g. Set threshold[i] = x + last_sum[i].

The problem is step 3c: finding the j with the maximum dp[j] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

If we can precompute a data structure that allows us to query the maximum dp[j] and the largest j achieving it in a range [0, j_max], then this approach becomes feasible.

To do this, we can maintain a segment tree that tracks, for each interval, the maximum dp value and the largest j with that value.

Building such a segment tree would allow us to query for the range [0, j_max] and get the maximum dp and the largest j where it occurs.

This would allow each query to be O(log n) time.

So the steps are:

- Precompute prefix_sum.

- Initialize threshold, dp, last_sum.

- Build a segment tree that tracks for each node the maximum dp and the largest j with that dp.

- For each i from 1 to n:

   a. x = prefix_sum[i].

   b. Binary search in threshold[0..i-1] to find j_max.

   c. Query the segment tree for the range [0, j_max] to get the maximum dp and the largest j in that range with that dp.

   d. dp[i] = max_dp +1.

   e. last_sum[i] = x - prefix_sum[j].

   f. threshold[i] = x + last_sum[i].

   g. Update the segment tree with the new dp[i] and threshold[i].

But wait, the segment tree needs to be built incrementally. For each i, after processing it, we add threshold[i] to the list and update the segment tree. So during the processing of i, the segment tree contains all j's up to i-1.

So for each i, the binary search is performed on the threshold array up to i-1, and the segment tree is queried for the range [0, j_max].

This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n), as each step involves a binary search (O(log n)) and a segment tree query (O(log n)).

But implementing a segment tree in Python for this purpose is possible, but may be time-consuming and somewhat involved.

Let's outline the code steps.

First, the binary search for j_max in the threshold array up to i-1:

Since threshold is strictly increasing, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of x in threshold[0..i-1], then j_max is the index -1.

For example:

import bisect

j_max = bisect.bisect_right(threshold, x, 0, i) -1

If j_max is >=0, then proceed.

Next, the segment tree needs to track for each interval the maximum dp value and the largest j with that value.

The segment tree will have each node representing a range of j's. Each node will store two values: the maximum dp in the range, and the maximum j in the range where dp[j] equals this maximum.

The merge operation for two child nodes would be:

- If left's max_dp > right's max_dp: take left's max_dp and left's max_j.

- If right's max_dp > left's: take right's.

- If equal: take the larger j.

Thus, each node can be constructed with this logic.

The segment tree is built incrementally. Initially, all j's are added one by one. For each i, after computing dp[i], we insert j=i into the segment tree.

But since we are processing i from 1 to n, and for each i, the segment tree must include all j from 0 to i-1 when processing i, the segment tree is built incrementally. So after processing i-1, we insert j=i-1 into the segment tree.

Wait, but j starts from 0. So for i=1, j can be 0. So the segment tree should have j=0 when processing i=1.

So the segment tree is built as we process j from 0 to n. For each j, after processing i=j+1, the j is added to the segment tree.

Thus, during the processing of i, the segment tree contains j from 0 to i-1.

Thus, the code would look like:

Initialize the segment tree with n+1 elements.

For i from 1 to n:

   x = prefix_sum[i]

   j_max = bisect.bisect_right(threshold, x, 0, i) -1

   if j_max < 0:

       current_max = 0

       best_j = -1

   else:

       current_max, best_j = segment_tree.query(0, j_max)

   if best_j == -1:

       dp_i = 0

       last_sum_i = 0

   else:

       dp_i = current_max +1

       last_sum_i = x - prefix_sum[best_j]

   dp[i] = dp_i

   last_sum[i] = last_sum_i

   threshold[i] = x + last_sum_i

   segment_tree.update(i, dp_i, i)

Wait, but the segment tree is indexed by j, and when we process i, we are adding j=i into the segment tree. So during the processing of i, the segment tree contains j=0 to j=i-1. For i=1, j=0 is in the segment tree.

But the initial segment tree should have all j's from 0 to n. But that's not possible because threshold[i] is computed as we go.

Hmm, this may be getting complicated. Let's think again.

The segment tree needs to be dynamic. For each j, after we compute dp[j], we add it to the segment tree. Then, when processing i, the segment tree contains all j's from 0 to i-1.

So for i=1, j ranges from 0 to 0. So after processing j=0, add it to the segment tree. Then, when processing i=1, the segment tree has j=0.

Thus, the code would be:

Initialize the segment tree.

segment_tree.insert(0, dp[0], 0)

For i from 1 to n:

   compute x = prefix_sum[i]

   j_max = binary search in threshold[0..i-1]

   query the segment tree for range [0..j_max], get (max_dp, best_j)

   dp[i] = max_dp +1 if best_j != -1 else 0 (but best_j can't be -1 for i >=1?)

   last_sum[i] = x - prefix_sum[best_j]

   threshold[i] = x + last_sum[i]

   insert j=i into the segment tree with dp[i] and i as j.

But wait, j=i is not processed yet. The j's in the segment tree are those from 0 to i-1.

So during the processing of i, the j's in the segment tree are 0 to i-1. So after processing i, we need to add j=i to the segment tree.

But the initial code for j=0:

Initially, segment_tree is empty. For j=0, after processing i=0 (dp[0] is set), we insert j=0 into the segment tree.

Then, for i=1, the segment tree contains j=0.

Thus, the correct approach is to insert j into the segment tree after processing i=j.

But this requires that when processing i, we have j's up to i-1 in the segment tree.

Thus, the code should be:

Initialize dp[0] =0, last_sum[0] =0, threshold[0] =0.

segment_tree.insert(0, dp[0], 0)

for i in 1 to n:

   x = prefix_sum[i]

   # binary search in threshold[0..i-1]

   j_max = bisect.bisect_right(threshold, x, 0, i) -1

   if j_max >=0:

       max_dp, best_j = segment_tree.query(0, j_max)

   else:

       max_dp = 0

       best_j = -1

   if best_j == -1:

       dp_i = 0

       last_sum_i = 0

   else:

       dp_i = max_dp +1

       last_sum_i = x - prefix_sum[best_j]

   dp[i] = dp_i

   last_sum[i] = last_sum_i

   threshold[i] = x + last_sum_i

   segment_tree.insert(i, dp_i, i)

But this way, for each i, after processing, we add j=i to the segment tree. But when processing i+1, j ranges up to i.

This seems correct.

But how to implement the segment tree.

Implementing a segment tree that supports range maximum queries with tracking of the maximum j.

Each node in the segment tree will store:

- max_dp: the maximum dp value in the range.

- best_j: the largest j in the range with this max_dp.

The merge function for two children is as follows:

def merge(left, right):

    if left.max_dp > right.max_dp:

        return Node(left.max_dp, left.best_j)

    elif right.max_dp > left.max_dp:

        return Node(right.max_dp, right.best_j)

    else:

        # same max_dp, take the larger j

        return Node(left.max_dp, max(left.best_j, right.best_j))

The segment tree needs to support range queries for [0, j_max], and updates to insert new j's.

But in Python, implementing a dynamic segment tree for this purpose is possible, but may be time-consuming.

Alternatively, since the j's are processed in order, and the segment tree is built incrementally, we can use a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) if possible.

But Fenwick trees are not straightforward for this type of query (range maximum with tracking of j). So a segment tree is probably better.

Alternatively, precompute a list of thresholds and j's, and use a list-based approach.

But perhaps the most practical way is to proceed with the original O(n^2) code and see if it can be optimized enough.

Let's try to implement the original code with some optimizations.

First, precompute the prefix sum.

Then, for each i, iterate j from i-1 down to 0. Why down to 0? Because as j decreases, the sum s increases, so once we find a j that gives a certain dp[j]+1, any j further to the left may give a larger dp[j]+1. But since the dp[j] can be up to j, which increases as j increases, iterating j from i-1 down to 0 may find the maximum dp[j] +1 early and break.

Wait, for example, when j is i-1, the sum s is h[i-1], which is the smallest possible sum for j in the current i. If this sum is >= last_sum[j], and dp[j] is the maximum possible, then this j is the best, and we can break early.

So the idea is to iterate j from i-1 down to 0, and for each j, check if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i]. If yes, then compute current = dp[j] +1. If this current is larger than the current max, update the max and best_s. If current is equal to the current max, check if s is smaller than best_s and update.

But if we iterate from j_max down to 0, once we find a j that gives the current_max equal to the possible maximum, we can break early.

For example, the maximum possible dp[j] +1 is the current_max. If we find a j where dp[j] +1 is equal to the possible maximum, and there's no j that can give a higher value, then we can break early.

But how to know the possible maximum.

The possible maximum is the current maximum of dp[j] +1 for j in 0..i-1.

But during the iteration, once we find a j where dp[j] +1 is higher than the current_max, we update current_max. Once we find a j where dp[j] +1 is equal to the current_max and s is minimal, we can continue to see if there's a j with higher dp[j].

But this seems uncertain.

Alternatively, during the iteration from j=i-1 down to 0, once we find a j that gives dp[j] +1 equal to the current_max and s is minimal, we can break early because any j left will have a larger s, but the dp[j] +1 may be higher.

Wait, no. Because j decreases, the sum s increases, but dp[j] may increase or decrease.

But if we find a j where dp[j] +1 is higher than any previously found, then we can set current_max to this value and continue, but if a higher value is found, the current_max would be updated.

But in practice, for large n, this approach may not save enough time.

Another optimization is to precompute the threshold array and use it in the inner loop, replacing the condition s >= last_sum[j] with threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

So the inner loop becomes:

for j in range(i):

    if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i]:

        current = dp[j] +1

        s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

        # check if current is better than current_max

This can save some time because the threshold[j] is precomputed and stored in a list, avoiding the need to compute s and compare with last_sum[j] in each iteration.

So the code becomes:

threshold = [0]*(n+1)

threshold[0] = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):

    threshold[i] = prefix_sum[i] + last_sum[i]

But no, because threshold[i] is computed after dp[i] and last_sum[i]. So during the inner loop for i, threshold[j] is already computed for j <i.

So during the inner loop for i, the threshold[j] for j <i is already available.

Thus, the code can be modified to precompute the threshold array.

So the code becomes:

n = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))
prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)
for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + h[i]

dp = [0]*(n+1)
last_sum = [0]*(n+1)
threshold = [0]*(n+1)  # threshold[j] = prefix_sum[j] + last_sum[j]

dp[0] = 0
last_sum[0] = 0
threshold[0] = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    max_segs = 0
    best_s = float('inf')
    for j in range(i):
        if threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i]:
            current = dp[j] + 1
            s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]
            if current > max_segs or (current == max_segs and s < best_s):
                max_segs = current
                best_s = s
    dp[i] = max_segs
    last_sum[i] = best_s
    threshold[i] = prefix_sum[i] + last_sum[i]

print(n - dp[n])

This code precomputes threshold[j] for each j, which allows the inner loop to replace the s >= last_sum[j] check with a simple comparison of threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i].

This should save some time in the inner loop.

Additionally, since the threshold array is strictly increasing, during the inner loop, once a j is found where threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], we can break the loop, since j decreases, but threshold[j] increases. Wait, no. Because in the current code, j runs from 0 to i-1. But threshold[j] is strictly increasing. So for j in 0 to i-1, threshold[j] increases with j.

Thus, in the inner loop, j runs from 0 to i-1, but the threshold[j] increases with j. So for i=5, j=0 has threshold 0, j=1 has threshold 16, j=2 has 20, etc.

But prefix_sum[i] is fixed. So threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i] is true for j up to j_max.

But in the current code, j runs from 0 to i-1. So for j > j_max, threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], and the condition threshold[j] <= prefix_sum[i] is false.

Thus, in the inner loop, j runs through all possible values, but only j up to j_max are considered.

But since j is running from 0 to i-1 in order, and the threshold[j] increases with j, once j exceeds j_max, all subsequent j's will have threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i]. So once j exceeds j_max, we can break the loop early.

Thus, the code can be optimized by finding j_max via binary search, then iterate j from 0 to j_max. Or, since j runs in order 0 to i-1, and threshold[j] is increasing, once we find the first j where threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], we can break the loop.

But in Python, the loop is from j in range(i), which is 0 to i-1. So in this case, the loop would check j=0, j=1, ..., j=i-1. But since threshold[j] is increasing, once j exceeds j_max, all j's after that will also have threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i]. So once we find j where threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], we can break the loop.

Thus, in the inner loop, after checking j, if threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], we can break the loop, since all subsequent j's (j+1 to i-1) will have threshold[j+1] >= threshold[j] > prefix_sum[i], thus their threshold is also > x.

So the inner loop can be optimized as follows:

for j in range(i):

    if threshold[j] > x:

        break

    current = dp[j] +1

    s = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

    # update max_segs and best_s

This would drastically reduce the number of iterations.

For example, for i=5 and x=21, j_max is 2 (threshold[2] =20 <=21, threshold[3] =26>21). So the loop would break after j=2. Thus, the inner loop would only run 3 times instead of 5.

This optimization can reduce the inner loop's iterations from O(n) to O(j_max +1). Since j_max can vary from 0 to i-1, but on average, this can save a lot of iterations.

This is a crucial optimization. So the code should be modified as follows:
