Okay, let's see. So the problem is about replacing zeros in sequence a with elements from b such that each element in b is used exactly once. And the resulting sequence must not be increasing. If that's possible, output yes, otherwise no.

Hmm, the first thing I need to do is figure out the conditions under which the sequence becomes not increasing. Because if even when we try to make it as increasing as possible (like inserting the elements in a way that maintains the increasing order), but even then it's not possible, then we can answer yes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says we need the sequence to be not increasing. So even if the optimal way (for making it increasing) exists, but there's another way that makes it non-increasing, then answer is yes. So the question is: can we arrange the elements from b into the zeros such that the resulting sequence is not strictly increasing (i.e., there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements where the next is not larger than the previous).

Alternatively, the problem is to check if it's possible to have at least one insertion of the elements from b into the zeros such that the entire sequence is not increasing. If even the best possible insertion (sorted in a way to make the sequence increasing) doesn't result in an increasing sequence, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, if the best possible insertion (sorted) makes the sequence increasing, then we have to check if there's another way to insert the elements to break the increasing order.

Wait, but if the optimal way (sorted) leads to an increasing sequence, then any other way might or might not break it. For example, inserting a smaller element in a position where it's allowed. So perhaps the approach is to first check if the "best" possible insertion (sorted in a way to make the sequence as increasing as possible) is still increasing. If even that fails (i.e., the best possible insertion leads to a non-increasing sequence), then we can immediately return yes. Otherwise, if the best insertion is strictly increasing, then we have to see if there's another insertion that breaks the increasing order.

But how do we find the best possible insertion that maximizes the chance of the sequence being increasing? Because if even that insertion results in a non-increasing sequence, then the answer is definitely yes. Otherwise, if the best insertion is strictly increasing, we need to check if there's any possible permutation of the inserted elements that would break that.

So the plan might be:

1. Sort the elements of b in a particular way (ascending or descending) and insert them into the zeros to form a candidate sequence. If this candidate is not strictly increasing, then output yes. Otherwise, check if there's another way to insert the elements such that the sequence is not strictly increasing.

Wait, but how to efficiently find the best possible insertion for making the sequence increasing? Because if the best possible insertion (sorted in a way to make the entire sequence as increasing as possible) is itself not increasing, then answer is yes. Otherwise, if the best is increasing, then maybe the only way to get a non-increasing sequence is to have some elements in b that when inserted in a different order, break the increasing sequence.

So perhaps the approach is:

- Generate the optimal insertion (sorted in a way to make the sequence as increasing as possible). If even that insertion doesn't result in an increasing sequence, then return yes.

- If the optimal insertion is increasing, then check whether there's an alternative insertion that breaks the sequence.

But how to check that alternative insertion efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: can we place the elements from b into the zeros in a way that the resulting sequence is not strictly increasing? So even if there's one possible way to do this, the answer is yes.

But the problem is that the elements from b must be used exactly once, and the original non-zero elements in a and the elements in b are all unique except for the zeros.

So, the first idea is: if after replacing all zeros with the elements of b sorted in a way that makes the entire sequence as increasing as possible, the resulting sequence is not strictly increasing, then answer yes. Otherwise, check if there's any other permutation of the b elements that can be inserted into the zeros to make the sequence not increasing.

But how to compute the optimal insertion (the one that gives the best chance for the sequence to be increasing)?

The optimal way to fill the zeros with elements from b in order to have the sequence increasing is to place the elements of b into the zeros such that each inserted element is as small as possible, given the constraints from the left and right. Wait, perhaps sorting the elements of b in ascending order and placing them in the zeros in such a way that they form the minimal possible increasing sequence. Alternatively, maybe the optimal approach is to sort the b elements in ascending order and insert them in the zeros in order, which would allow the sequence to be as increasing as possible.

Alternatively, the optimal way to make the sequence as increasing as possible is to insert the elements of b in ascending order. Let's think of the zeros as positions where we can choose the elements. For each zero, the inserted element must be larger than the previous element (if any) and smaller than the next element (if any). If we sort the b elements and try to place them in the zeros in order, we can maximize the possibility of the sequence being increasing. If even that arrangement is not increasing, then any other arrangement would also not be increasing, so the answer is yes. But if that arrangement is increasing, then we need to see if any other arrangement of the b elements would break the increasing order.

Wait, no. Suppose the sorted arrangement (ascending) is the best possible for making the sequence increasing. If even that is not possible, then there's no way to make the sequence increasing, so the answer is yes. Otherwise, if the sorted arrangement is indeed increasing, then perhaps there's a way to arrange the b elements in a different order such that the sequence becomes non-increasing.

So the approach could be:

1. Sort the elements in b in ascending order. Then, replace the zeros in a with these elements in the order they appear in the sorted list, and check if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing. If it's not, then answer yes.

2. If the sorted arrangement results in a strictly increasing sequence, then check if there exists any permutation of the elements in b such that when inserted into the zeros, the sequence is not strictly increasing. If such a permutation exists, answer yes. Otherwise, answer no.

But checking all permutations is not feasible for k up to 100, since permutations would be 100! which is way too big. So we need a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by checking if the sorted arrangement (ascending) is the only possible way to make the sequence increasing, and if there's any possibility to insert elements in a way that violates the increasing order.

Wait, but how? Let's think of some cases.

Take the first example: a is [11,0,0,14], b is [5,4]. The sorted arrangement would be 4,5. Inserted into the zeros: 11,4,5,14. Wait, but the first sample's possible arrangements are [5,4] and [4,5]. Oh wait, the zeros are in positions 2 and 3 of the array. So inserting 5 and 4 in order gives 11,5,4,14. That sequence is 11 <5 is false. So 5 is after 11, but 4 is after 5. So 5 is in the first zero, 4 in the second. Then the sequence is 11,5,4,14. Which is 5 < 11 is false. Wait no: 11 is the first element. Then 5 is next. So 11 >5, so the sequence is not increasing here. So the resulting sequence is not increasing, hence the answer is yes.

But in this case, the sorted arrangement of b (ascending is [4,5]) would be inserted into the zeros in the order of the zeros. Wait, perhaps the way to insert the elements in the optimal (for increasing) way is to arrange the elements such that each inserted element is as small as possible given the constraints. But in this case, the sorted arrangement may not be the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way to insert the elements in order to form an increasing sequence is to sort the elements in b in ascending order and then place them in the zeros in such a way that each inserted element is between the previous and next elements.

Wait, but how to arrange that. For example, if the zeros are in positions that require the inserted elements to be in a certain order.

Hmm, perhaps the optimal approach for creating an increasing sequence is to sort the elements of b in ascending order and insert them into the zeros in order (from left to right), ensuring that each inserted element is as small as possible but still greater than the previous element and less than the next element.

But this might not be possible. For example, if the zeros are in a sequence where the next non-zero element is smaller than the previous one.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to arrange the elements of b to make the entire sequence as increasing as possible is to sort them in ascending order and insert them into the zeros in order. If even this arrangement is not increasing, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, if this arrangement is increasing, then we need to check if there's a way to permute the elements to create a non-increasing sequence.

But how?

Let's think of the second sample input:

Input is 6 1, a is [2,3,0,8,9,10], and b is [5]. The only possible insertion is 2,3,5,8,9,10. Which is strictly increasing. So the answer is no.

So in this case, the optimal arrangement is the only possible, and it's strictly increasing, so answer is no.

So the idea is that if the sorted arrangement is the only possible way to insert elements and it's strictly increasing, then answer is no. Otherwise, if there's any other arrangement possible, maybe even inserting a higher element earlier, which could cause a decrease.

But how to check that.

Another example: suppose the a sequence is [0,0,0], and b is [1,2,3]. The sorted insertion gives [1,2,3], which is increasing. But any permutation of the elements would also be in order. So inserting [3,2,1] would result in a non-increasing sequence. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but in this case, the sorted arrangement is increasing. But another permutation exists that breaks the increasing order. So even though the optimal sorted arrangement is increasing, there exists another permutation that makes the sequence non-increasing. So in this case, the answer is yes.

So the problem reduces to: if the sorted arrangement (ascending) of b inserted into the zeros is strictly increasing, then we need to check if there exists a way to permute the elements of b such that the insertion into the zeros leads to a non-increasing sequence.

If such a permutation exists, then answer yes. Otherwise, no.

But how to check if such a permutation exists.

Another approach: once we have the optimal arrangement (sorted ascending) leading to an increasing sequence, then the answer is yes if and only if there's a way to permute the elements of b such that when inserted into the zeros, the sequence is not increasing. So how to check that.

An alternative idea is to check whether all possible permutations of b, when inserted into the zeros, result in a strictly increasing sequence. If even one permutation breaks this, then answer yes. Otherwise, answer no.

But generating all permutations is not feasible for k up to 100. So we need a smarter approach.

Another thought: if after inserting the sorted b in ascending order into the zeros, the sequence is strictly increasing, then the answer is yes if and only if there exists at least two elements in b such that swapping them in their positions (within the zeros) would lead to a non-increasing sequence.

But how to check that.

Alternatively, the answer is yes if the sorted arrangement is not strictly increasing, OR, even if it is, there's a way to choose a different permutation of b that breaks the sequence.

So the steps could be:

1. Replace the zeros in a with the elements from b, sorted in ascending order, in the order of the zeros. Check if this resulting sequence is strictly increasing. If not, output yes.

2. If the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, then check if there exists any possible way to arrange the elements in b such that the sequence is not increasing. If yes, output yes. Otherwise, no.

But how to check step 2 efficiently.

Wait, here's an idea: if the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, then to make the sequence non-increasing, there must be at least two elements in b such that if their positions are swapped in the insertion, the resulting sequence has a place where a[i] >= a[i+1].

But how to find such a pair.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to insert a larger element earlier in the zeros, leading to a decrease.

For example, in the third sample input:

4 1

a is [8,94,0,4], b is [89]

The sorted arrangement would be inserting 89 into the zero, resulting in 8,94,89,4. Which is 8 <94, 94 >89 (so here's a decrease), so the answer is yes. Wait, but the sample output is yes. So in this case, the sorted arrangement is not strictly increasing, so the answer is yes.

Wait, but in this case, the sorted arrangement is the only possible (since k=1), and it's already non-increasing, so answer yes.

Hmm, so in this case, the sorted arrangement is non-increasing, so answer is yes.

Another example: if a has two zeros in a row, and b has two elements. The sorted arrangement is [x, y] (x < y), but inserting them as y, x would create a decrease. So if the sorted arrangement is increasing, but swapping the two elements would create a decrease, then the answer is yes.

So, perhaps the approach is: if after inserting the sorted elements in ascending order, the sequence is strictly increasing, then check if there are any two elements in b that are adjacent in the insertion and can be swapped to create a decrease.

Alternatively, for any two elements in the inserted positions (from b), if swapping them would cause a decrease in the sequence, then answer yes.

But again, how to check this without trying all pairs.

Alternatively, in the sorted arrangement, if all elements are in the correct order (strictly increasing), then the answer is no only if all permutations of the inserted elements would also result in a strictly increasing sequence. That can only happen if all elements of b are in a position where each inserted element is strictly between the previous and next elements of a. But that's unlikely unless the b elements are placed in such a way that any permutation would fit into the same constraints.

Wait, let's think: suppose the zeros are in positions that form a contiguous block. For example, a is [1,0,0,5], and b is [2,3]. The sorted insertion would be [1,2,3,5], which is strictly increasing. But if we swap them to [3,2], then the sequence is [1,3,2,5]. Here, 3>2, so there's a decrease. Hence, the answer would be yes.

So, in this case, even if the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, swapping the inserted elements can create a non-increasing sequence.

Thus, the answer is yes unless all possible permutations of the inserted elements would result in a strictly increasing sequence. But when is that possible?

Only if, for every permutation of the elements in b, inserting them into the zeros in any order would still result in a strictly increasing sequence. Which can only happen if the elements in b, regardless of their order, are placed such that each element is greater than the previous element in a and less than the next.

But given that the elements in b are unique and must be used exactly once, and the problem states that apart from 0, all elements in a and b are unique. So for example, if the zeros are in positions that are between two existing elements in a, and the elements in b are all between those two elements. Then, any permutation of the elements in b would still fit into the sequence. For instance, a is [1,0,0,4], and b is [2,3]. Then inserting [3,2] gives [1,3,2,4]. Here, 3>2, which is a decrease. So even though the sorted insertion is increasing, another permutation breaks it.

But what if the zeros are not contiguous? For example, a is [0, 5, 0], and b is [1, 6]. Then sorted insertion would be [1,5,6], which is increasing. But inserting [6,1] gives [6,5,1], which is 6>5 and 5>1. So the sequence is not increasing. So the answer is yes.

Hmm, so even when the zeros are non-contiguous, swapping elements can lead to a non-increasing sequence.

Therefore, the only case when the answer is "No" is when the sorted arrangement of b (ascending) into the zeros leads to a strictly increasing sequence, and any permutation of the elements of b would also lead to a strictly increasing sequence. Which is only possible if all elements of b are inserted into positions that are strictly between the elements of a, such that any permutation of the elements of b would fit into their respective positions.

But how can that happen?

For example, suppose a has two zeros separated by a non-zero element, and the elements of b must fit into their respective positions. For example, a is [0, 3, 0], and b is [1,4]. Then inserting [1,4] gives [1,3,4] (increasing). But inserting [4,1] gives [4,3,1], which is 4>3 and 3>1 (non-increasing). So answer is yes.

Another example: a is [0, 0], and the elements before the first zero are all less than the elements after the zeros. For example, a is [0,0], and the previous elements (if any) are less than the elements after. Wait, a has two zeros. Suppose the entire array is [0,0], and b is [1,2]. Then inserting sorted gives [1,2], which is increasing. Any permutation would give [2,1], which is non-increasing. So answer is yes.

Wait, so in all cases, if the sorted arrangement is increasing, but there's at least two elements in b, then there exists a permutation that breaks the increasing sequence.

Wait, this suggests that whenever the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing and the size of b is more than 1, then the answer is yes. Because swapping any two elements in the inserted positions would create a non-increasing sequence.

Wait, for example, if the sorted arrangement is [b1, b2, ..., bk], sorted in ascending order. Then, swapping any two elements in this list (say, the first and the last) would create a permutation where the first element is larger than the next. So if inserting them in that order would cause a decrease.

But this depends on where the zeros are placed. For example, if the zeros are separated by non-zero elements that are larger than all elements of b, then inserting in any order may not affect the overall sequence.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's take an example where a is [0, 5, 0], and b is [1, 2]. The sorted arrangement is [1,5,2]. Wait, but a is [0,5,0], and inserting 1 and 2 into the zeros. So the first zero is replaced with 1, the second with 2. So the array becomes [1,5,2]. Which is 5>2, so the sequence is not increasing. So even the sorted arrangement is not increasing, so answer is yes.

Hmm, but that's a different scenario. Let's think of a case where the sorted arrangement is increasing, but there are two elements in b. For example, a is [0,0], and the elements before and after the zeros are such that inserting any permutation of b would not break the sequence.

Wait, but if the zeros are at the end. For example, a is [0,0], and there are no elements after. Then, any permutation would be possible. So if b is [2,3], then the sorted arrangement is [2,3], which is increasing. But swapping gives [3,2], which is decreasing. So the answer is yes.

So in all cases where k >=2 and the sorted arrangement is increasing, there exists a permutation of b that breaks the sequence. So in such cases, the answer is yes.

Only when k ==1, inserting the element into a zero can result in a strictly increasing sequence, and there's no other way to insert it (since there's only one element in b). So in that case, if the sorted arrangement (the only possible) is strictly increasing, then answer is no. Otherwise, yes.

So the conclusion is:

If the sorted arrangement of b (ascending) inserted into the zeros results in a sequence that is not strictly increasing, then answer is yes.

Otherwise, if k >=2, then answer is yes.

Otherwise (k ==1 and sorted arrangement is strictly increasing), answer is no.

Because when k >=2, even if the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, we can swap two elements in the inserted positions to create a non-increasing sequence.

Wait, but how to confirm this.

For example, let's take a scenario where a is [1, 0, 0, 4], and b is [2,3]. The sorted arrangement is [1,2,3,4], which is strictly increasing. But if we swap the two elements in b to get [3,2], the sequence becomes [1,3,2,4]. Here, 3>2, which is a decrease. So the answer is yes.

Another example: a is [0,0,0], and b is [1,2,3]. The sorted arrangement is [1,2,3], which is increasing. But swapping any two elements (e.g., [2,1,3]) would create a sequence like 2>1, leading to a decrease. So answer is yes.

Another example: a is [0,0], and the surrounding elements are such that the two elements in b must fit into a strict increasing order. Like a is [0,0] and the elements before the first zero are less than the elements after the second zero. But since there are no elements after, the two zeros are the end. Then, inserting in reverse order (like [3,2]) would make a non-increasing sequence.

So, in all cases where k >=2, even if the sorted arrangement is increasing, there's a way to permute the elements to make the sequence non-increasing. So the answer is yes.

Only when k=1 and the sorted arrangement is increasing, then there's no other permutation, so the answer is no.

So the algorithm becomes:

1. Replace the zeros in a with the elements of b sorted in ascending order, in the order they appear in the zeros. Check if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing. If not, output yes.

2. Else, check if k >=2. If yes, output yes.

3. Else (k=1), output no.

Because when the sorted arrangement is increasing and k >=2, there's always a permutation of the elements (swapping two elements) that breaks the increasing sequence.

So the steps for code:

- Read n, k.

- Read a, which has k zeros.

- Read b.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Create a new array by replacing zeros in a with elements of sorted b, in order.

- Check if this new array is strictly increasing.

   - If not, output yes.

   - Else:

      - If k >=2, output yes.

      - Else, output no.

Wait, but why is that the case? Because when k >=2, even though the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, we can permute the elements in b in a way that breaks the increasing sequence.

For example, in a scenario where the zeros are in a way that the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, but permuting the elements in b would cause at least one pair to be out of order.

But why would that permutation necessarily exist?

Yes. Because the sorted array is strictly increasing. So the elements in the sorted list are in order: b1 < b2 < ... < bk. If we swap any two elements, say, bi and bj where i < j and bi < bj, and j is not the immediate next, but the key is to swap two adjacent elements. Wait, but even if the elements are inserted into the zeros, which are in order in a, then inserting them in a different order could create a decrease.

For example, a is [1,0,0,4], and b is [2,3]. The sorted arrangement is [1,2,3,4], which is strictly increasing. If we insert [3,2], the sequence becomes [1,3,2,4]. Here, 3>2, which is a decrease. So the answer is yes.

Thus, in any case where k >=2 and the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, we can swap the first two elements in the sorted list to create a permutation that, when inserted, creates a decrease.

But wait, what if the elements in the sorted list are all placed in positions where they are between the previous and next elements in a, such that any permutation would not violate the order?

But that's impossible. For example, consider a case where a is [0, 0, 5], and b is [1,2]. The sorted arrangement is [1,2,5], which is increasing. If we swap the elements to [2,1,5], then the sequence becomes [2,1,5], which has 2>1. So even though the first two elements are in the same position, their order affects the sequence.

Another example: a is [0, 0], and there are no elements after. The sorted arrangement is [1,2], which is increasing. But inserting [2,1] gives [2,1], which is decreasing. So answer is yes.

So in all cases where k >=2 and the sorted arrangement is strictly increasing, there exists a permutation of the elements of b that breaks the sequence, hence the answer is yes.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

Implement the sorted replacement, check if it's not increasing. If not, output yes. Else, if k >=2, output yes. Else, output no.

Let's test this logic against the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

4 2

11 0 0 14

5 4

sorted b is [4,5]

Replacing zeros gives: 11,4,5,14.

Check if strictly increasing: 11 <4? No. So the sequence is not increasing. So output yes.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

6 1

2 3 0 8 9 10

5

sorted b is [5].

Replaced sequence is [2,3,5,8,9,10], which is strictly increasing. Since k=1, output no.

Sample 3:

4 1

8 94 0 4

89

sorted b is [89].

Replaced sequence is 8,94,89,4. Check if strictly increasing: 94>89, so no. So output yes.

Sample4:

7 7

All zeros. b is 1-7 sorted.

Replaced sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Which is strictly increasing. But since k=7 >=2, output yes.

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: k=2, sorted arrangement is increasing. So code outputs yes.

Another test case: a is [0,0], b is [1,2]. sorted arrangement is increasing. Since k=2 >=2, output yes.

Another test case: a is [0,5,0], b is [3,4]. sorted arrangement is [3,5,4]. Check if strictly increasing: 3 <5 <4? 5>4, so no. So output yes.

Another test case: a is [0,0,0], and b is [1,2,3]. sorted arrangement is increasing. since k=3 >=2, output yes.

Another case where sorted arrangement is increasing but k=1: output no.

Thus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Now, the code steps:

1. Read n, k.

2. Read a as a list.

3. Read b as a list.

4. Sort b in ascending order.

5. Create a list filled with the elements of a, replacing zeros with elements from sorted b in order.

6. Check if this list is strictly increasing.

7. If not, output yes.

8. Else:

   if k >=2, output yes.

   else, output no.

So the code can be written as:

Read n, k.

Read a.

Read b.

sorted_b = sorted(b)

new_a = []

b_idx = 0

for num in a:

    if num ==0:

        new_a.append( sorted_b[b_idx] )

        b_idx +=1

    else:

        new_a.append(num)

Then check if new_a is strictly increasing.

If not, print yes.

Else:

   if k >=2: yes

   else: no

How to check if the new_a is strictly increasing.

We can loop from 0 to len(new_a)-2, check if each element is less than the next.

For example:

is_increasing = True

for i in range(len(new_a)-1):

    if new_a[i] >= new_a[i+1]:

        is_increasing = False

        break

if not is_increasing:

    print("Yes")

else:

    if k >=2:

        print("Yes")

    else:

        print("No")

That's the code.

Testing sample 4:

input:

7 7

0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

new_a is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is strictly increasing. Since k=7 >=2, output yes.

Yes, correct.

Sample 2:

new_a is [2,3,5,8,9,10], strictly increasing. k=1, output no.

Sample3:

new_a is [8,94,89,4]. 94>89: not increasing. So output yes.

Sample1: new_a is [11,4,5,14]. 11>4: not increasing. So output yes.

Thus, code works.

So the code seems correct.
