Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given sequence is a geometric progression, or can become one by deleting exactly one element. If neither, output 2. Otherwise, 0 or 1 accordingly.

First, I need to understand what a geometric progression is. Oh right, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. But wait, according to the problem's definition, the sequence can have zero elements. Hmm, like the example [0,0,0,0] is allowed, but if there's a zero followed by non-zero, that's a problem because after a zero, you can't multiply by a ratio to get a non-zero. So need to handle zeros carefully.

The steps are:

1. Check if the original sequence is a geometric progression. If yes, output 0.
2. If not, check if removing exactly one element can make it a geometric progression. If possible, output 1.
3. Otherwise, output 2.

Now, the challenge is to do this efficiently given that n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. So any O(n) or O(n) approaches are needed. We can't check all possible deletions (like for each position, remove it and check) for n=1e5, that would be O(n^2), which is way too slow.

So, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the possible scenarios where removing one element can turn the sequence into a geometric progression.

First, for the original sequence:

Check if all consecutive pairs have the same ratio. That's straightforward. But handling zeros is important. For example, if the sequence has a zero followed by a non-zero, then it's not a geometric progression. But if after that, all elements are zero again, that's possible. Wait no: for example [0, 0, 5, 0], the ratio between 0 and 0 is undefined (since 0/0 is undefined). So in such cases, the sequence isn't considered a geometric progression unless all elements after the first are zero. Wait, according to the problem's definition, a geometric progression is a sequence where a_i = c * b^{i-1}. For example, [0,0,0,0] is valid (c is 0, any b?), but maybe the ratio can be zero. Wait, perhaps the problem's definition allows any ratio as long as the formula holds. So for the sequence [0,0,0], c=0, and any b would work, but the ratio between consecutive terms would be 0/0, which is undefined. Hmm, perhaps the problem's definition is a bit ambiguous here. But according to the examples given, like [0,0,0,0] is considered a geometric progression. So perhaps, the ratio is allowed to be undefined in the case where consecutive elements are zero, but the sequence as a whole must be a geometric progression. So the ratio is only checked between non-zero elements. Or maybe, the way the problem is structured, any two consecutive elements must form a ratio that's consistent. But that's not the case. For example, if all elements are zero, then each term is zero. So the ratio between consecutive terms is 0/0, which is undefined, but the problem says [0,0,0,0] is a geometric progression. So perhaps the problem's definition is that the sequence can be written as a geometric progression according to the formula, regardless of the actual ratio between consecutive terms. That makes sense. For example, if c=0, then all terms are zero. So in this case, the ratio doesn't matter. So in the code, when checking if a sequence is a geometric progression, if all elements except the first are zero, but the first is non-zero, then that's invalid. But if all elements are zero, then it's valid. Wait, if a sequence is [0,0,0], then according to the formula, c=0 and any b would work. But in reality, the terms would be 0, 0*b, 0*bÂ², etc. So regardless of b, all terms after the first are zero. So any sequence of all zeros is a valid geometric progression. So for the code, in the case of all zeros, the answer is yes.

So, to check if a sequence is a geometric progression:

Case 1: All elements are zero. Then yes.

Case 2: The first element is zero but others are non-zero. Then no.

Case 3: The first element is non-zero. Then we need to compute the initial ratio and check if all subsequent terms follow the ratio. But if any term except the first is zero, then the ratio can't be maintained. For example, if the first term is non-zero, but the second is zero, then the ratio is zero, but the third term must be zero as well, which would have a ratio 0/0 which is undefined. So in that case, the sequence can't be a geometric progression.

Wait, but according to the problem's definition, a_i = c * b^{i-1}.

So, for example, if c=2, b=0, then the sequence is 2, 0, 0, 0, etc. So the first term is 2, next terms are zero. So the ratios between consecutive terms would be 0/2 = 0, then 0/0 (undefined). So according to the problem's example, such a sequence would be considered a geometric progression. Because the formula is satisfied. So even if some ratios are undefined, as long as the terms fit the formula, it's a valid geometric progression.

Wait, no. Let's take the example [2,0,0,0]. According to the formula, a_1 = 2, a_2 = 2*0^1=0, a_3=2*0^2=0, etc. So the sequence is a geometric progression. So the ratios between consecutive terms are 0/2=0 (but the ratio between the first and second is zero), then 0/0 which is undefined. But the problem's definition allows this. Therefore, when checking the sequence, the approach must be to check if there's a ratio that works for all elements, not just check consecutive ratios.

But how can we check that? Because the ratio could be determined from the first two elements, but if any of them is zero, then the rest must be zero, or maybe not? Wait, no. Let's see:

If the first two elements are 2 and 0, then the ratio is 0. So the third element must be 0 * 0 = 0. Fourth element is 0 * 0 = 0. So yes. The entire sequence would be [2,0,0,0], which is a valid geometric progression. So in this case, the code must accept it.

But if the first element is non-zero, second element is zero, and third element is non-zero, then it's invalid. Because a3 would have to be 0 * ratio, which is zero. So in that case, the sequence is invalid.

So how to check for geometric progression?

The steps are:

If the sequence has length 1: it's always a GP.

Else:

If all elements are zero: valid.

Else:

Check if there exists a common ratio such that each element can be derived from the previous one multiplied by this ratio. But since the elements are integers (from the input), but the ratio can be a real number. So the ratio can be a fraction. For example, [2, 6, 18] has ratio 3, [6, 4, 8/3] is not integer, but according to the problem's input, all elements are integers. So the input sequences have integer elements, but the ratio can be a real number. So the code can't just check for ratios between integers, but must compute the ratio as a real.

But when checking the ratio, the code can't use floating points because of precision errors. So how to handle this?

Alternative approach: To avoid floating points, represent the ratio as a fraction (numerator and denominator), but even that can get complicated. Alternatively, for the original sequence, compute the ratio between the first two elements, and then check if each subsequent element is equal to the previous multiplied by that ratio.

But if one of the first two elements is zero, then this approach might not work. For example, if a[0] is zero and a[1] is non-zero, then the ratio is undefined, so the sequence is not a GP. If a[0] is non-zero and a[1] is zero, then all subsequent elements must be zero.

So here's a plan to check if a sequence is a GP:

def is_gp(sequence):
    if len(sequence) <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if all elements except first are zero
    if sequence[0] != 0:
        ratio = sequence[1] / sequence[0]  # possible division by zero?
        # but if sequence[0] is non-zero, then division is allowed
        # check that for all i >=2, sequence[i] == sequence[i-1] * ratio
        # but since the elements are integers, ratio can be a float, but multiplication must match exactly
        # but how to handle this with possible floating point precision issues?
        # Alternatively, represent the ratio as a fraction (numerator and denominator)
        # To compare without floating points, check cross products.
        # For each i, sequence[i] * denominator == sequence[i-1] * numerator
        # where numerator is sequence[1], denominator is sequence[0]
        # But for sequences where denominator is zero (sequence[0] is zero), then we need to check if all other elements are zero.
        # So let's split into cases.
        # Case 1: sequence[0] is zero.
        # Then all elements must be zero to be a GP.
        # Because a_1 is zero, so c=0. Then all terms must be zero.
        # So for sequence starting with zero, check if all elements are zero.
        # Case 2: sequence[0] is non-zero. Then ratio is a[1]/a[0]
        # Then for each i >= 2, check if a[i] * a[0] == a[i-1] * a[1]. Because:
        # (a[i]/a[i-1]) should equal (a[1]/a[0]), so cross multiply.
        # This avoids floating points.
        # So here's the approach:
        # if sequence has at least two elements:
        if sequence[0] == 0:
            # check all elements are zero
            return all(x == 0 for x in sequence)
        else:
            # compute the ratio as a fraction a[1]/a[0]
            # then check for each i >=2, a[i] * a[0] == a[i-1] * a[1]
            numerator = sequence[1]
            denominator = sequence[0]
            for i in range(2, len(sequence)):
                if sequence[i] * denominator != sequence[i-1] * numerator:
                    return False
            return True
    else:
        # sequence[0] is zero. So check if all elements are zero.
        return all(x == 0 for x in sequence)

Wait, but if the sequence is [0,0,0], then the code returns True. If the sequence is [0,0,5], then returns False, which is correct.

But what about when the first element is zero but the rest are zero? Then it's valid.

So this function should correctly check if the sequence is a GP.

Now, the first step is to check if the original sequence is a GP. If yes, output 0.

If not, then check if removing exactly one element can make it a GP.

The next part is tricky. How to check if removing one element can make it a GP, in O(n) time.

Because n can be up to 1e5, we need an O(n) approach.

Let's think: when you remove an element, the new sequence must be a GP. So the candidate positions to remove are those where the existing sequence has a violation of the GP condition. So we need to find possible positions to remove and check if that makes the rest a GP.

But trying all possible positions is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Alternative approach: find the first position where the GP condition is violated. Then try to remove either the current element or the previous one and see if the rest can form a GP.

For example, suppose the original sequence is a GP up to index i-1, then at index i, there's a problem. Then try removing index i, check if the remaining sequence from 0 to i-1 and i+1 to end forms a GP. Or try removing index i-1, check the same.

But this approach may not cover all possibilities, but perhaps in practice, the number of candidates is small. However, for large n, even this might not be feasible.

But for the problem, perhaps the candidate positions are limited to the first few elements where the GP condition is violated, so trying to remove those positions and check the entire array may be manageable.

But how to find the positions where the violation occurs.

Alternative plan:

Find the first position where a[i] * denominator != a[i-1] * numerator (using the same approach as the GP check). Then, when such a position is found, check two possibilities: remove a[i], or remove a[i-1], and see if either of the modified sequences is a GP.

If either is a GP, then return 1. Else, proceed to check other possible positions. But if the code checks all possible violation points, it's possible that there are multiple candidates, but for the problem's constraints, perhaps the code can check up to two possibilities (the first violation point) and see if removing either of the two positions fixes the problem.

Because in a valid scenario where exactly one element is causing the problem, the code would detect it in the first violation and the removal would fix the rest.

Wait, but for example, the original sequence could have a problem at multiple positions, but removing one element could fix all of them. For example:

Original sequence: [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]. The first violation is at index 4 (element 9). But the problem is that 8*2 !=9*1. If we remove index 4, the sequence becomes [1,2,4,8], which is a GP. So the code would detect this.

But if the first violation is at index i, but removing a different index may fix it. For example:

Consider a sequence where the first few elements are correct, then a violation occurs. But the problem is not due to the violation point, but perhaps a previous element. For example:

Original sequence: [2,4,8,16,32, 64, 130, 256]. The violation is at index 6 (130). But the correct element should be 128, then 256. So removing index 6 (130) would make the sequence [2,4,8,16,32,64,256], which is not a GP. But perhaps the error is in index 6. Alternatively, maybe removing index 5 (64) would make the sequence [2,4,8,16,32,130,256], which is not a GP.

But in this case, the code would check the first violation (index 6) and try to remove index 6 or 5.

Wait, the first violation is at index 6 (a[6] = 130). The previous elements up to index 5 are correct. The code would check two possibilities: removing index 6 (the 130) and check if the remaining sequence up to index 5 plus 7 is a GP. Or remove index 5 (64) and check if the remaining sequence (including 130) is a GP.

But in this case, neither of those removals would fix the problem, so the code would return 2.

But let's take the example given in the problem:

Sample Input 2:
4
-8 -16 24 -32

The original sequence is not a GP. Let's check why:

Compute the initial ratio: (-16)/-8 = 2. The next term should be -16 *2 = -32, but instead it's 24. So the violation is at index 2 (24).

So the code would try to remove index 2 (24) or index 1 (-16). Let's see:

If we remove index 2 (24), the sequence becomes [-8, -16, -32]. Check if it's a GP:

ratio is -16/-8=2. Next term is -16 *2 = -32. So yes. So the code returns 1.

Alternatively, removing index 1 (-16), the sequence is [-8,24,-32]. Check if this is a GP. The ratio is 24/-8 = -3. Next term should be 24*(-3) = -72, but it's -32. So no. So only removing index 2 works. So the code would detect this.

So the approach is to:

1. Check the original sequence. If it's a GP, output 0.

2. Else, find the first index where the GP condition is violated.

3. Check two possibilities: remove the violating index, or remove the previous index. Check if either modified sequence is a GP.

4. If either is a GP, output 1.

5. Else, check another possibility: maybe the problem is in the first few elements. For example, if the first two elements have a ratio, but the third element is correct with a different ratio. So removing the first element may allow the rest to form a GP. For example:

Sequence [a, b, c, d], where a and b's ratio is r1, but b and c's ratio is r2. Then perhaps removing a allows the sequence [b, c, d] to be a GP with ratio r2.

But in the code's initial approach, the first violation is at index 2. So the code would try removing index 2 (c) or index 1 (b). But if the correct removal is index 0 (a), then the code would miss it.

So the initial approach may not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider the sequence [1, 3, 6, 12]. The original ratios are 3/1=3, 6/3=2 (violation). The code would check removing index 2 (6) or index 1 (3). Removing index 2 gives [1,3,12], which has ratios 3 and 4, not a GP. Removing index 1 gives [1,6,12], which has ratio 6 and 2. Not a GP. But if we remove index 0 (1), the sequence [3,6,12] has ratio 2, which is a GP. But the code's initial approach would not check this.

So the code would miss this case, leading to a wrong answer.

So the approach of only checking the first violation and its neighboring elements is insufficient. Hence, the code needs to consider other possibilities.

Alternative plan:

In addition to checking the first violation, also check the possibility of removing the first element or the second element. Because sometimes, the problem is in the first elements.

So the steps would be:

After checking the original sequence is not a GP:

- Check the first position where the GP condition is violated (call it pos).

- Generate two modified sequences: one without pos, one without pos-1. Check each for GP.

- Additionally, check two more possibilities: removing the first element, and removing the second element.

Because in some cases, the error is in the first few elements.

But this increases the number of possibilities to check. However, since each check is O(n), and the number of possibilities is small (like 4), this is manageable.

Wait, but even checking four possibilities (each O(n)) would be O(4n), which is acceptable for n=1e5.

But how to handle the case where the sequence is very long and the error is in the first two elements?

For example:

Sequence [1,2,4,8,16,32]. It's a GP. So output 0.

Another example: [1,2,5,8,16]. The first violation is at index 2 (5). Check removing 2 (5) gives [1,2,8,16], which is 2,4,2 ratio. No. Removing index 1 (2) gives [1,5,8,16], which is 5/1=5, 8/5=1.6, which is not a GP. So the code would proceed to check other possibilities, but none. So output 2. But perhaps there's another element to remove elsewhere. For example, if the sequence is [2, 1, 2, 4, 8], the first violation is at index 1 (1). Check removing index 0 (2) gives [1,2,4,8], which is a GP. But in the code's initial approach, this case is not covered because the first violation is at index 1. So the code would try to remove index 1 (1) or index 0 (2). Removing index 0 gives [1,2,4,8], which is a GP. So the code would check this and return 1.

Wait, but according to the code's approach, after finding the first violation at index 1 (the second element), the code would generate modified sequences by removing index 1 (element 1) or index 0 (element 2). Then check if either modified sequence is a GP.

So in this case, removing index 0 gives [1,2,4,8], which is a GP. So the code would return 1.

Thus, in this scenario, the code would work correctly.

So the initial approach of checking the first violation and the two possible positions (current and previous) would handle some cases. But there are cases where the violation occurs later, but the correct element to remove is the first one. For example:

Sequence [a, b, c, d], where the first two elements are a and b. The first violation is at index 2 (c). The code would try removing index 2 or index 1. But the correct element to remove might be index 0 (a). For example:

Original sequence: [2,4,8,16]. Suppose the third element is 15 instead of 16. Then the sequence is [2,4,8,15]. The first violation is at index 3 (15). So the code would check removing index 3 or 2. Removing index 3 gives [2,4,8], which is a GP. So the code returns 1. But if the error is in the first element:

Example: [3, 6, 12, 24, 48]. Suppose the first element is 3 but should be 6. Then the sequence is [6,6,12,24,48]. The first violation is at index 0 (6), but the code's approach to check the first violation would be when i=1. Wait, let's see:

In the code's GP check, for the first two elements (6 and 6), the ratio is 1. Then the third element is 12. Check 6*1 =6. 12 should be 6*1=6. So 12 !=6. So the first violation is at index 2. The code would check removing index 2 (12) or index 1 (6). Removing index 1 gives [6,12,24,48], which has ratios 2, 2, 2. So that's a GP. So the code would return 1.

So the code's approach would handle this case correctly.

Another example where the first element is wrong:

Original sequence: [2,4,8,16,32]. But suppose the first element is 3. So the sequence is [3,4,8,16,32]. The first violation is at index 1 (4). Because 3 is the first element, the code checks the ratio between index 0 and 1. 4/3 is not an integer, but the code uses cross multiplication. The code would check if 4 * 3 == 3 *4 (since the next element is 8). Wait, the first two elements are 3 and 4. Then for index 2 (8), check 8 *3 =4 *4? 24 vs 16. No. So first violation is at index 2. Then the code tries removing index 2 (8) or index 1 (4). Removing index 1 gives [3,8,16,32], which has ratios 8/3, 16/8=2. Not a GP. Removing index 2 gives [3,4,16,32], which has ratios 4/3, 16/4=4. Not a GP. But the correct element to remove is index 0 (3). Removing index 0 gives [4,8,16,32], which is a GP. The code's approach would miss this case. So the code would output 2, which is wrong.

So in this scenario, the code's approach is insufficient.

Hmm. So how can this be handled?

So the problem is that the first violation occurs later in the sequence, but the correct element to remove is earlier. How can the code detect that?

In this example, the code's approach would check the first violation at index 2 (element 8). It would try removing 8 (index 2), which leads to [3,4,16,32]. Check if this is a GP: 4/3 is the ratio. Next element should be 4*(4/3) = 16/3 â5.333, but it's 16. So no. Removing index 1 (4) gives [3,8,16,32]. Ratio is 8/3. Next is 8*(8/3) = 64/3 â21.333, but 16 is not equal to that. So no. So the code would output 2, but the correct answer is 1 (removing index 0).

So the code's approach would fail in this case.

So how to handle this?

This suggests that the code's approach of checking the first violation and the two possible positions may not cover all possible cases. Hence, the code needs to check other possibilities as well.

Alternative idea: In addition to checking the first violation, also check removing the first element and the second element, even if there's no violation in the first two elements.

Because maybe the error is in the first element, which leads to a violation later.

But how to do this efficiently?

But checking all possibilities would take O(n) time for each check. For example:

Possible steps:

Check the original sequence. If it's a GP, output 0.

Else:

Check the following possibilities:

1. Try removing the first element, and check if the rest form a GP.

2. Try removing the second element, and check if the rest form a GP.

3. Find the first violation and try removing either of the two positions (i or i-1).

4. Also, check the last element. Because sometimes the error is at the end.

Wait, but the code would then check up to 5 possibilities (remove first, second, last, i-1, i). For each possibility, generate the modified sequence and check if it's a GP.

But for n=1e5, this would be O(5n) time, which is acceptable.

But how to generate the modified sequence efficiently?

Wait, but in Python, creating a new list for each modified sequence (by omitting one element) would take O(n) time and space, which is not acceptable for n=1e5. So instead, we need a way to check the modified sequence without creating a new list.

For example, when checking the possibility of removing index k, the code can check the entire sequence, skipping index k.

But how?

The code can write a helper function that takes the original list and a list of indices to skip, and checks if the modified list is a GP.

But even for checking a single skipped index, this helper function would need to loop through the list, skipping that index. For example:

def check_removed(arr, skip):
    n = len(arr)
    if n - 1 <= 1:
        return True
    # Check if after removing skip, the rest is a GP.
    # Need to check the first two elements after removal.
    first = -1
    second = -1
    count = 0
    prev = None
    for i in range(n):
        if i == skip:
            continue
        if count == 0:
            first = arr[i]
            count +=1
            prev = arr[i]
        elif count == 1:
            second = arr[i]
            count +=1
            if first == 0:
                if second !=0:
                    return False
                else:
                    # Check all remaining elements are zero.
                    for j in range(i+1, n):
                        if j == skip:
                            continue
                        if arr[j] !=0:
                            return False
                    return True
            else:
                numerator = second
                denominator = first
                # Check the rest
                prev = second
        else:
            if arr[i] * denominator != prev * numerator:
                return False
            prev = arr[i]
    return True

But this approach for checking the modified sequence (with one element skipped) is O(n) time. So for each of the possibilities (like 5 possibilities), the code would run O(n) time.

So total time would be O(5n), which is acceptable for n=1e5.

But this may be tight for Python, but perhaps manageable.

So the plan is:

Check the original sequence. If it's a GP, output 0.

Else:

Check the following possibilities (each time O(n)):

1. Remove the first element and check.

2. Remove the second element and check.

3. Remove the last element and check.

4. Find the first violation position i. Check removing i.

5. Find the first violation position i. Check removing i-1.

If any of these checks returns True, then output 1.

Else, output 2.

But why check the last element? For example, consider a sequence where the error is in the last element. Like [2,4,8,16,33]. Removing the last element gives [2,4,8,16], which is a GP. So the code would find this.

So how many possibilities are there? Up to 5 possibilities (first, second, last, i, i-1). But perhaps this covers all possible cases.

But there's a problem with this approach: for example, when the sequence is [a, b, c, d], and the error is in the third element. Then the first violation is at i=2. The code checks removing i=2, i=1, first, second, and last. But if the correct solution requires removing an element after the first violation, like in a longer sequence, but the code's approach may miss it.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can check all possibilities of removing the first three elements and the last three, but that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: check all possible candidates where the error may be. But for n=1e5, how to manage this?

Another approach is to collect all possible candidates where the error may be and check them. But the number of candidates must be O(1).

But how to collect these candidates.

Alternatively, the code can check the following candidates:

- The first two elements (removing first or second)

- The last two elements (removing last or second last)

- The first violation and its previous index.

But this may not cover all cases, but may handle most.

But this may still miss some cases.

Alternatively, when the original sequence is not a GP, we can collect all possible positions where the violation occurs (i.e., positions where a[i] * denominator != a[i-1] * numerator), but there could be many such positions.

But perhaps the code can collect the first three such positions and check their neighboring indexes.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the code can generate a list of possible candidates to remove (say, up to 10 candidates) and check each.

But for n=1e5, even 10 candidates would take O(10n) time.

But how to generate these candidates.

Alternatively, the code can proceed as follows:

If the original sequence is not a GP, collect the first three positions where the violation occurs, and for each such position, check removing it and the previous index. Then, also check removing the first, second, last, and second last elements.

But this approach may be overkill.

Alternatively, the code can check all possible candidates in the first three violation positions and their previous positions, plus the first and last elements.

But perhaps this is manageable.

But for the sake of time, perhaps the code should check the following candidates:

- The first violation position and the previous one.

- The first element.

- The second element.

- The last element.

Thus, for example:

In the case where the error is in the first element, but the first violation is detected later, the code would check removing the first element and find that it works.

So the code would:

Check the original sequence. If not a GP:

Generate a list of candidate indices to remove: [0, 1, -1, first_violation, first_violation-1]

For each candidate in this list, check if removing it results in a GP.

If any of these checks returns True, output 1. Else, output 2.

But how to handle duplicates in the candidate list (e.g., first_violation-1 could be 0, which is already in the list).

But even if some duplicates are checked, it's not a problem.

So, let's implement this approach.

Now, the steps:

1. Check if the original sequence is a GP. If yes, output 0.

2. Else, find the first violation position. Let's call it i.

3. Generate the list of candidates to remove: [0, 1, -1, i, i-1]. (Note: -1 is the last element)

4. For each candidate in this list:

   a. If the candidate is out of bounds (like, i-1 is -1 when i=0), skip.

   b. Check if removing the candidate index makes the sequence a GP.

   c. If any of them returns True, then output 1.

5. If none of them work, output 2.

But how to handle when the first violation is at index 0? For example, the first two elements are wrong.

Wait, the first violation is when i=1 (since for the first two elements, the ratio is computed, then the third element is checked. So the first violation can be at i=2 (third element). So the first violation i is >=2.

Wait, no. Let's think:

The code checks the GP condition for the original sequence. The code for checking the GP is:

for i in range(2, len(sequence)):

So if the sequence has length 3 (elements 0, 1, 2). The first violation can be at i=2.

So the first violation is detected when the third element (index 2) is not in line with the first two.

So for the first violation, i is the index where the check failed.

But in the case of the first two elements not being a valid ratio, but the sequence is longer than 2 elements, then the code would check the third element, and since the first two are invalid, the third element's check is done, and it's found to be invalid. But this is not correct.

Wait, no. The code for checking the GP is:

def is_gp(sequence):

    if len(sequence) <=1:

        return True

    if sequence[0] ==0:

        return all(x ==0 for x in sequence)

    else:

        numerator = sequence[1]

        denominator = sequence[0]

        for i in range(2, len(sequence)):

            if sequence[i] * denominator != sequence[i-1] * numerator:

                return False

        return True

So in this code, the first check is between elements 0 and 1. If those two are invalid (e.g., sequence[0] is zero and sequence[1] is non-zero), then the code returns False. But if sequence[0] is non-zero, and sequence[1] is zero, then the code proceeds to check the rest.

So for example, a sequence like [2,0,0,0] is considered a GP. Because after the first element (2), the next is 0. So the code checks whether all subsequent elements are zero (since the first is non-zero, but the second is zero, which implies that all subsequent elements must be zero. So in this example, the code returns True.

But for a sequence like [2,0,3], the code would check:

sequence[0] is 2 (non-zero), sequence[1] is 0. numerator is 0, denominator is 2.

Then for i=2, sequence[2] * 2 must equal sequence[1] * 0.

sequence[2] is 3: 3*2=6, sequence[1] *0=0. So 6 !=0. So returns False. So the code correctly detects that this sequence is not a GP.

But the first violation is at i=2.

So the first violation is detected in the third element. But the problem may be in the second element.

So in the code's approach for checking after removing candidate positions, it's possible that the code needs to check removing the second element (index 1) to see if the remaining sequence is a GP.

So in the code's plan for generating candidates, the first violation's i is 2. So the candidates to remove are 0,1,-1, 2, 1 (i-1).

So the code would check removing index 1 (the second element), leading to the sequence [2,3]. Which is a GP (ratio 3/2). So the code would return 1.

Thus, the code would handle this case.

But how to find the first violation in the original sequence.

The code's GP checker returns False, but how to find the first i where the condition is violated.

To find the first violation, we need to modify the GP checker to track where the violation occurs.

But the problem is that the code needs to find the first violation position to generate the candidates.

So, perhaps, when checking if the original sequence is a GP, we can track the first position where the violation occurs.

So here's the plan:

Modify the is_gp function to return not just a boolean, but also the first violation index (if any).

But for the purpose of checking whether the original sequence is a GP, we can have a helper function that returns both a boolean (whether it's a GP) and the first violation index (if it's not a GP).

But this is more efficient than re-checking.

Alternatively, when the original sequence is not a GP, we can find the first violation index by iterating through the sequence.

So:

def find_first_violation(sequence):

    if len(sequence) <=1:

        return -1

    if sequence[0] ==0:

        # Check if all are zero. If not, find the first non-zero.

        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):

            if sequence[i] !=0:

                return i

        return -1  # is GP

    else:

        numerator = sequence[1]

        denominator = sequence[0]

        for i in range(2, len(sequence)):

            if sequence[i] * denominator != sequence[i-1] * numerator:

                return i

        return -1  # is GP

But this function returns the first index where the violation occurs. Or returns -1 if the sequence is a GP.

Wait, no. Because if the first two elements are zero (sequence[0] is zero, but sequence[1] is zero), but the other elements are zero, then it's a GP. So in that case, the function returns -1.

But if sequence[0] is zero and sequence[1] is non-zero, then it's not a GP, and the first violation is at index 1.

So the function find_first_violation(sequence) returns the first index where the sequence violates the GP condition. If the sequence is a GP, returns -1.

Thus, when the original sequence is not a GP, we can find the first violation index (i), and generate the candidates to remove as i and i-1.

But for the example where the sequence is [3,4,8,16,32], the first violation is at i=2 (since a[2] is 8, but according to the first two elements (3 and 4), the next term should be 4*(4/3) = 5.333, which is not 8. So the code would find i=2. The candidates are 0,1,-1,2,1.

Checking removing index 0 gives [4,8,16,32], which is a GP. So the code would detect this.

Thus, the code's approach would work.

So the plan is:

Check if the original sequence is a GP. If yes, output 0.

Else, find the first violation index i.

Generate candidates to remove: 0,1,-1,i,i-1.

Check each candidate (if within bounds) by removing that index and checking if the resulting sequence is a GP.

If any of them is valid, output 1. Else, output 2.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But for large n (like 1e5), we need to avoid creating new lists. So for each candidate, we need to check the sequence by skipping the candidate index.

So, implementing a helper function that checks if removing a certain index makes the sequence a GP.

The helper function can be:

def is_valid_after_removal(sequence, skip_index):

    n = len(sequence)

    if n ==1:

        return True  # because after removal, the list is empty? No. Wait, original sequence has n=1. But we are to remove one element. So the new sequence has n-1 elements, which is zero. But according to the GP definition, a single-element sequence is a GP.

    # So when n-1 is zero, after removal, it's empty. But the problem states that the new sequence must be a GP. But according to the problem's definition, a GP can be of length 1. So if the new sequence has length 0, it's not considered as a GP.

    # Wait, the problem says that after deletion, the sequence must be a GP. So if after deletion, the sequence has zero elements (n-1=0), then it's not considered a valid GP. So when n is 1 and the code is checking after removing that element, the new sequence is empty, which is not a valid GP.

    # So in the helper function, we need to handle this.

    # So, for the helper function:

    # The new sequence is the original sequence with 'skip_index' removed.

    # The new sequence must have at least one element and be a GP.

    new_len = n-1

    if new_len ==0:

        return False  # empty sequence is not a GP.

    # Now, check the new sequence.

    # To avoid creating a new list, iterate through the original sequence, skipping 'skip_index'.

    # Collect the first two elements (if available), then check the rest.

    first = None

    second = None

    prev = None

    zero_in_first = False

    for i in range(n):

        if i == skip_index:

            continue

        if first is None:

            first = sequence[i]

            prev = first

        elif second is None:

            second = sequence[i]

            prev = second

            # Check if first is zero.

            if first ==0:

                # If second is not zero, then the new sequence cannot be a GP.

                if second !=0:

                    return False

                # Else, all remaining elements must be zero.

                zero_in_first = True

            else:

                ratio_num = second

                ratio_den = first

        else:

            # Check subsequent elements.

            if zero_in_first:

                if sequence[i] !=0:

                    return False

            else:

                # Check if sequence[i] * ratio_den == prev * ratio_num

                if sequence[i] * ratio_den != prev * ratio_num:

                    return False

                prev = sequence[i]

    # After collecting the elements.

    # Handle cases where new_len is 1: valid.

    if new_len ==1:

        return True

    # If new_len >=2.

    # Check if the first two elements are zero.

    if first ==0:

        # All elements must be zero.

        # But we have already checked that.

        # So if new_len >=2, and first is zero, and second is zero, then the rest are zero (checked).

        return True

    else:

        if second is None:

            # new_len is 1. Which is handled above.

            pass

        else:

            # The ratio_num and ratio_den are set.

            # So the rest of the elements (if any) are checked.

            return True

    return True

But this helper function has to handle various edge cases. Let's test it.

Test case 1:

sequence = [3,4,8,16,32], skip_index = 0.

The new sequence is [4,8,16,32]. The helper function should return True.

Let's see:

first =4, second=8. first !=0.

ratio_num=8, ratio_den=4=2.

Check third element (16): 16*4 == 8*8? 64=64. Yes.

Fourth element (32): 32*4 = 16*8 â 128=128. Yes. So returns True.

Test case 2:

sequence = [3,4,8,16,32], skip_index=1 â new sequence [3,8,16,32].

Check:

first=3, second=8. ratio_num=8, ratio_den=3.

Next element is 16. 16*3 =48. 8*8=64. 48 !=64 â returns False.

So helper function returns False.

Test case 3:

sequence = [2,0,0,0], skip_index=0 â new sequence [0,0,0]. first=0. second=0. So zero_in_first is True. All elements are zero. Returns True.

Test case4:

sequence = [0,0,5], skip_index=2 â new sequence [0,0]. All elements are zero â returns True.

Test case5:

sequence = [0,0,5], skip_index=0 â new sequence [0,5]. first=0. second=5. second is not zero. So returns False.

Thus, the helper function seems to handle these cases.

Thus, the code can proceed with the helper function.

Now, the code:

Read n, then the sequence.

Check if n is 0 â but according to the input constraints, n >=1.

Check if the original sequence is a GP. If yes, output 0.

Else:

Find the first violation index.

Generate the list of candidates.

Check each candidate.

If any of the candidates, when removed, makes the sequence a GP, output 1.

Else, output 2.

Thus, the code would look something like:

Sample Input 3:

4

0 1 2 3

Original sequence is not a GP.

First violation: since first element is zero, check if all are zero. But second element is 1. So first violation is index 1.

Candidates are 0,1,-1,1,0.

Check removing 0: new sequence [1,2,3]. Check:

1,2. ratio 2. Next term 3. 2*2=4 !=3. Invalid.

Removing 1: new sequence [0,2,3]. first element 0. second element 2. Not zero â invalid.

Removing -1 (3): new sequence [0,1,2]. first element is zero, second is 1. Invalid.

Removing 1 (same as previous).

Removing 0 (same as previous).

None of the candidates work. So output 2.

So the code works for these samples.

Another test case:

Sequence [3,4,8,16,32], remove index 0.

Helper function returns True.

Another test case:

sequence [2,4,8,15], remove index 3 (15). new sequence [2,4,8]. Which is a GP. So code would output 1.

Another test case:

sequence [3,4,8,16,32], first violation is at 2. Candidates are 0,1,4,2,1. Checking removing 0 gives a GP.

Thus, the code would output 1.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.
