Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about performing some operations on a list of numbers and then maximizing the sum of their squares. Hmm. The operation is to pick two distinct indices, replace one with the AND of the two and the other with the OR. And we can do this any number of times. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of squares after these operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. Let's take two numbers x and y. After the operation, they become x AND y and x OR y. Wait, but wait, the sum of these two numbers changes? Let's see: (x AND y) + (x OR y) = x + y. Because when you add them, each bit in x and y is counted. For example, for a particular bit position, if x has it set and y has it set, then AND gives 1 and OR gives 1, sum 2. Which is same as x's bit (1) plus y's bit (1) which is 2. If x has 1 and y has 0, then AND is 0, OR is 1. Sum is 1, same as x's 1 + y's 0. So yes, the sum of the two numbers remains the same after each operation. So the total sum of all elements in the array is preserved. But the sum of squares can change.

But we need to maximize the sum of squares. So how can we arrange the numbers to get the maximum sum of squares possible, given that the total sum remains the same. Wait, but sum of squares is maximized when the numbers are as unequal as possible. For example, given a fixed sum, the maximum sum of squares is when one number is as large as possible and the others are as small as possible. Because (a^2 + b^2) is maximized when a and b are as far apart as possible, given a fixed a + b. So maybe the optimal strategy is to create as many zeros as possible and one or a few large numbers.

But how can the operations help us achieve that? Let's think about the effect of the operations. Let's take two numbers x and y. After the operation, they become x' = x & y and y' = x | y. Let's compute the sum of squares before and after. Before: x² + y². After: (x&y)² + (x|y)². How do these compare?

Let's compute (x&y)² + (x|y)². Let's see. For any two numbers, the sum after operation is (x & y)^2 + (x | y)^2. Let's compare it to x² + y². Let's expand the squares.

We can note that (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical identity here. Let's compute (x & y) + (x | y) = x + y. So sum is preserved. But what about the sum of squares?

Let's take some examples. For example, x=3 (011), y=5 (101). After operation, x becomes 1 (001), y becomes 7 (111). Sum of squares before: 9 + 25 = 34. After: 1 + 49 = 50. Which is higher. So in this case, performing the operation increases the sum of squares.

Another example: x=2 (10), y=2 (10). After operation, x and y are 2&2=2 and 2|2=2. Sum of squares remains the same. So no change.

Another example: x=4 (100), y=1 (001). After operation, x becomes 0 (000), y becomes 5 (101). Sum of squares before: 16 + 1 =17. After: 0 +25=25. So again, sum increases.

So it seems that when we perform the operation on x and y, the sum of squares increases. But when is that the case? Let's see. Let's compute the difference between the sum after and before.

After sum - before sum = (x&y)^2 + (x|y)^2 - (x² + y²).

Let me expand x|y. x|y = x + y - x&y. So x|y = x + y - (x&y).

So substituting into the difference:

(x&y)^2 + (x + y - x&y)^2 - (x² + y²).

Let me let a = x&y. Then x|y = x + y - a.

So difference is a² + (x + y -a)^2 - x² - y².

Expanding the second term: (x + y)^2 - 2a(x+y) + a².

So overall:

a² + x² + y² + 2xy - 2a(x+y) + a² - x² - y².

Simplify:

a² + a² + 2xy - 2a(x+y).

So 2a² + 2xy - 2a(x + y).

Factor out 2:

2[ a² + xy - a(x+y) ]

= 2[ a² - a(x + y) + xy ]

But note that a is x&y. Let's think about x and y in binary. For each bit, the AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. So a is the sum of the bits where both are set. Let's also note that x + y = (x | y) + (x & y). Because when you add two numbers, each bit position contributes 2 times the number of overlapping set bits (since x and y have 1s in that position) plus 1 for each non-overlapping. Wait, maybe that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for a² + (x | y)^2. Let's see. Let's see, x | y = x + y - a. Then (x | y)^2 = (x + y - a)^2 = x² + y² + a² + 2xy - 2x a - 2y a. So when we add a² to that, we get:

a² + x² + y² + a² + 2xy - 2x a - 2y a.

So sum after is 2a² + x² + y² + 2xy - 2a(x + y).

Original sum is x² + y². So difference is 2a² + 2xy - 2a(x + y).

Factor 2: 2(a² + xy - a(x + y)).

Hmm. Let's see: a is x&y, which is the sum over all bits where both x and y have a 1. So for each bit, if x and y both have 1, that contributes 2^k to a. So, for example, if x and y have overlapping bits, then a is the sum of those overlapping bits.

But perhaps this difference is equal to 2(xy - a(x + y - a))). Wait, maybe not. Let me compute:

Let me see, a = x & y. Then x ^ y is the bits where exactly one of x or y is set. So x | y = a + (x ^ y). So x + y = (a) + (a) + (x ^ y) = 2a + (x ^ y). Wait, no: x + y = (x | y) + (x & y) → because when you add, the overlapping bits (a) contribute twice, and the non-overlapping bits contribute once. So x + y = (x | y) + (x & y) → which is (a + (x|y - a)) ) → no, wait. x | y is a + (x ^ y), because x ^ y is the bits that are set in exactly one of x or y. So x + y = (x | y) + (x & y) → a + (x|y) → but x | y is a + (x ^ y), right? Wait, maybe not. Let's see: for example, x=3 (011), y=5 (101). x|y=7 (111). x&y=1 (001). So x+y=8. x|y + x&y=7+1=8. So yes, x + y = (x|y) + (x&y). So the sum of x and y is equal to the sum of their OR and AND. So that's correct.

But how does that help with the difference in the sum of squares?

Hmm. Let's try to find the difference again.

After sum - before sum = 2(a² + xy - a(x + y)).

But since x + y = a + (x|y), substituting here:

a² + xy -a(a + (x|y)) → a² + xy -a² - a(x|y) = xy - a(x|y).

But x|y is the OR of x and y. So the difference is 2(xy - a(x|y)).

But a is x&y. So the difference is 2(xy - (x&y)(x|y)).

But wait, xy is equal to (x&y)(x|y) + (x^y)^2 /4? Hmm. Let me check. For example, x=3, y=5. x&y=1, x|y=7. (x&y)(x|y) =7. xy=15. So 7 + something equals 15? (x^y) is 6. So (6)^2 /4 = 36/4=9. 7 +9=16, which is not 15. So that identity isn't correct. Wait, maybe I should think of x and y in terms of their bits.

Alternatively, perhaps (x&y)(x|y) = x y. Let me see for x=3, y=5: 1*7=7, which is less than 15. So no. So (x&y)(x|y) is less than xy. So the difference is 2(xy - (x&y)(x|y)) → which is positive. So this implies that after the operation, the sum of squares increases by 2*(xy - (x&y)(x|y)).

Wait, but for x=3 and y=5: xy is 15. (x&y)(x|y) is 1*7=7. So 15-7=8. Multiply by 2 gives 16. The sum after minus sum before is 50-34=16. Which matches. So the difference is indeed 2*(xy - (x&y)(x|y)).

So the sum of squares increases by this amount when we perform the operation on x and y. So as long as xy > (x&y)(x|y), performing the operation increases the sum. Wait, but that's always true? Let's see. Let's take x=2, y=2. xy=4. (x&y)(x|y)=2*2=4. So difference is zero. So no change. So in that case, performing the operation leaves the sum the same.

Another example: x=4, y=1. xy=4. (x&y)=0, (x|y)=5. So (x&y)(x|y) =0. Difference is 4*2=8. Sum after is 0 +25=25, sum before 16+1=17. Difference 8. So yes.

So the operation increases the sum of squares if and only if xy > (x&y)(x|y). But when is that the case?

Wait, let's compute (x&y)(x|y) = (x&y) * (x | y) = (x&y) * (x + y - (x&y)) ), since x|y = x + y - x&y.

So expanding (x&y)(x + y - x&y) = (x&y)(x + y) - (x&y)^2.

So the difference between xy and that is:

xy - [ (x&y)(x + y) - (x&y)^2 ] = xy - (x&y)(x + y) + (x&y)^2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can see that (x&y)(x|y) is equal to x*y when x and y are such that they have no overlapping bits. For example, x=4 (100), y=1 (001). x&y is 0, x|y is 5. So (x&y)(x|y) =0, which is not equal to x*y=4. So in that case, xy > (x&y)(x|y) → 4>0 → true, so the sum increases.

But when x and y share some bits, like x=3 and y=5, then (x&y) is 1, x|y is 7 → 1*7=7 <15. So the difference is positive. So in all cases except when x and y are such that (x&y) * (x|y) = xy, which would be when?

Wait, (x&y) * (x|y) = xy → ?

Let me rearrange. Let a = x&y, b =x|y. Then a*b = x*y. But since x + y = a + b (from earlier), and x * y = a * b. So substituting x + y = a + b into x * y = a*b. Let's see. Suppose x and y are such that x + y = a + b and x*y = a*b. Then, substituting a + b = x + y into x*y = a*b. So x*y = a*( (x + y) - a ). So x*y = a(x + y) - a². But x + y = a + b → substituting, x*y = a*(a + b) - a² = a b. So this is consistent. So the equation x*y = a*b holds. So in this case, the difference is zero. So when x and y are such that x*y = (x&y)*(x|y), which holds when x and y are such that (x&y)*(x|y) =x*y. But this seems to only hold when x and y are such that they don't have overlapping bits. Wait, no. Let me see. Let x=2 and y=2. Then x&y=2, x|y=2. So (x&y)*(x|y) =4 = x*y. So in this case, the difference is zero. So when x and y are equal, performing the operation leaves the sum the same.

So the sum of squares increases when (x&y)*(x|y) < x*y. Wait, but how can that be possible? Because (x&y) is a part of x and y. Or maybe it's possible when x and y have overlapping bits, leading to a higher product when multiplied. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this condition is equivalent to x and y having overlapping bits. Because when x and y have overlapping bits, then (x&y) is non-zero, and (x|y) is x + y - (x&y). So (x&y)*(x|y) = (x&y)(x + y - (x&y)) = (x&y)(x) + (x&y)(y) - (x&y)^2. But x and y's product is x*y. So for the product (x&y)(x|y) to be less than x*y, perhaps there's some condition on the bits.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference between x*y and (x&y)(x|y) is equal to (x ^ y)^2 /4. Let me check with x=3 (011) and y=5 (101). x^y is 6 (110). (6^2)/4 is 36/4=9. x*y is 15. (x&y)(x|y) is 1*7=7. 15-7=8. 9 is not equal to 8. So that's not correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is (x ^ y)^2 /2. For x=3 and y=5, (6^2)/2=18. But 15-7=8. So no. Not matching. So maybe that's not the case.

So maybe the sum of squares increases whenever x and y are not such that one is a subset of the other's bits. For example, if x and y have overlapping bits, then performing the operation increases the sum. But when they are orthogonal (no overlapping bits), then (x&y) is zero, so (x&y)(x|y) is zero, and x*y is non-zero. So difference is positive. So in that case, sum increases.

Wait, so in all cases except when x and y are such that (x&y)(x|y) =x*y, performing the operation increases the sum. But when does (x&y)(x|y) =x*y?

We can see that x&y is a part of x and y. So for example, when x and y are the same, then x&y=x, x|y=x. So (x&y)(x|y) =x². Which equals x*y (since x=y). So in that case, the difference is zero. So performing the operation on two equal elements does nothing.

Another example: x=0 and y=5. x&y=0, x|y=5. So product is 0. x*y=0. So difference is zero. So no change.

So the sum of squares can be increased only when x and y are not equal and have overlapping bits. Wait, but in the example where x=3 and y=5, they have overlapping bits (the 1st bit), but the sum increases. So perhaps the only time the sum doesn't increase is when x and y are such that x = a and y = a, so that x&y = a, x|y =a, so product is a², which equals x*y =a². So no change.

So for any two distinct numbers, performing the operation will either increase the sum of squares (if they are not equal and have overlapping bits) or leave it the same (if they are equal or no overlapping bits). Wait, but even if two numbers are distinct but their AND and OR product equals their product, then performing the operation would leave the sum the same. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the sum increases whenever x and y are not such that x|y = x + y. Which is when x and y have no overlapping bits. Because when x and y have no overlapping bits, x&y is zero, x|y is x + y. So (x&y)*(x|y) =0. x*y is the product. So difference is 2*(x*y -0) =2xy. So in that case, performing the operation increases the sum by 2xy. But wait, that's the same as when you have two numbers with no overlapping bits.

Wait, for example, x=4 (100) and y=1 (001). x&y=0, x|y=5. So the sum after the operation is 0^2 +5^2=25. Before, it's 16+1=17. Difference is 8, which is 2*(4*1) =8. So yes, in this case, the difference is 2xy. So when x and y have no overlapping bits, performing the operation increases the sum by 2xy. Which is a significant gain. So perhaps the optimal approach is to perform as many operations as possible on pairs that have overlapping bits, so that we can get their sum of squares higher.

But how do we reach the maximum possible sum? Let's think: the sum of squares is maximized when the elements are as unequal as possible, given the total sum. Because sum of squares is maximized when one element is as big as possible, and the others are as small as possible. So perhaps the best way is to collect all the bits and arrange them such that each bit is concentrated in as few elements as possible.

But how does the operation allow us to redistribute the bits? Let's think about each bit independently. For example, suppose there are two numbers that have a certain bit set. The operation allows us to combine the bits. Let's see: suppose two numbers x and y both have the k-th bit set. Then after the operation, x becomes x AND y, which has the k-th bit set (since both had it), and y becomes x OR y, which has the k-th bit set. So in this case, the bit is preserved in both. So nothing changes for that bit. But if x has the bit and y does not, then after the operation, x becomes x AND y (bit 0), and y becomes x OR y (bit 1). So the bit moves from x to y. Wait, no. If x has the bit and y doesn't:

Original x: ...1..., y: ...0...

After operation, x becomes x AND y: ...0..., y becomes x OR y: ...1...

So the bit is moved from x to y. So after the operation, the bit is present in y, but not in x.

So this suggests that through these operations, we can move bits from one number to another. So for each bit position, we can collect all the bits and put them into a single number. Because each time we have a number with the bit set and another without, we can transfer the bit to the other number, but how?

Wait, if we have a number a that has the k-th bit, and a number b that does not, then after the operation, a will lose the bit (since a AND b will have the k-th bit only if both have it, which they don't), but b will gain it (since a OR b will have it). So after the operation, a has the k-th bit cleared, and b has it set. So the bit is moved from a to b. So through this, we can collect all the bits of a particular position into a single number.

But how? Let's say we have multiple numbers with the k-th bit set. For example, three numbers: a, b, c with the k-th bit set. We can perform operations between them to collect the bits into one.

Wait, suppose a and b both have the k-th bit. Then performing the operation on them leaves a as a AND b (which has the k-th bit) and b as a OR b (which also has the k-th bit). So the count of bits in this position remains the same. So the total number of bits in each position is preserved. Because each operation on x and y leaves the OR and AND of x and y, but the sum x + y is preserved. So for each bit, the total number of times it appears across all numbers is preserved. Because adding x and y for any two numbers preserves the sum, and thus the sum of bits in each position (since each bit's contribution is 2^k multiplied by the number of times it is set).

So the key insight is that the total number of set bits in each position is fixed. So for each bit position k, the sum across all numbers of the k-th bit is fixed. So the maximum sum of squares can be achieved by distributing the bits in such a way that the sum of squares is maximized, given that each bit's count is fixed.

So how to distribute the bits? For each bit position, the sum of squares depends on how many numbers have that bit set. Because each occurrence of the bit in a number contributes 2^k to that number. So for the sum of squares, each bit's contribution is (number of times it's set in a number) * (2^k)^2, but that's not directly additive because the numbers are sums of their bits. Wait, perhaps the sum of squares can be broken down into the sum over all bits and their interactions.

Alternatively, the sum of squares can be written as the sum for each number of (sum of bits in that number) squared. Which expands to the sum over all pairs of bits in the same number, multiplied by their contributions. So for each pair of bits in the same number, their product (2^i * 2^j) is added to the sum. So the sum of squares is maximized when as many high pairs of bits as possible are combined into the same numbers.

Alternatively, the sum of squares can be written as the sum of (sum of bits in each number)^2. Expanding this, it's the sum of each individual bit squared plus twice the sum of all pairs of bits in the same number. But individual bits squared are 4^k (since (2^k)^2 = 4^k), and the cross terms are 2 * 2^i * 2^j = 2^{i + j + 1}.

So the sum of squares can be maximized by grouping as many bits as possible into the same numbers, because the cross terms contribute more. For example, if two bits are in the same number, their cross term contributes 2*2^i * 2^j. If they are in different numbers, they contribute nothing. So to maximize the sum of squares, we want as many pairs of bits as possible to be in the same numbers.

Therefore, the optimal arrangement is to have as few numbers as possible with as many bits as possible, and the rest with zero. Because that way, all the bits are grouped together, maximizing the cross terms.

But since for each bit position k, the count of set bits across all numbers is fixed (equal to the original count), the best way to arrange them is to have for each bit, the set bits are all in the same number. Wait, no. Wait, for example, suppose for bit positions i and j, if you have them in the same number, you get a cross term. So the optimal strategy is to group as many bits as possible into the same numbers. But given that for each bit, the number of times it appears is fixed, how can we arrange them?

Wait, let's think about each bit's count. Let’s say for bit k, there are c_k set bits across all numbers. Then, in any configuration, the total contribution of the k-th bit to the sum of squares is c_k * 4^k (since each occurrence is (2^k)^2), plus the cross terms between different bits in the same numbers.

But the cross terms depend on how the bits are grouped. For example, if two bits i and j are in the same number, their cross term is 2 * 2^i * 2^j. So the total sum of cross terms for all pairs of bits in the same numbers is sum_{i < j} [ (number of numbers that have both bits i and j) * 2 * 2^i * 2^j ].

But since the counts of each bit are fixed (c_i for bit i), how can we maximize this sum? We want to group as many bits as possible into the same numbers. For example, if all bits are in the same number, then all pairs contribute. But if they are spread across different numbers, some pairs don't contribute.

So the maximum sum of squares is achieved when all bits are grouped into as few numbers as possible. But how? Because each bit's count is fixed, but the way to group them depends on the counts.

Wait, for each bit k, there are c_k occurrences. So for example, if c_k is 3, then in the optimal arrangement, we would have three different numbers each with the k-th bit set. But that's not possible because the sum of the bits for that position is fixed. Wait, no. The sum of the bits for each position is fixed. For example, if the original numbers have a total of 3 set bits in position k, then in any configuration after the operations, the total number of set bits in position k is 3. So for that bit, each number can have 0 or 1 in that position. So the total sum across all numbers for that bit is 3.

So how can we arrange these 3 set bits to maximize the sum of squares? The sum of squares for that bit's contribution is sum_{numbers} (bit k's contribution) squared. For each set bit, the contribution is 2^k. So for three set bits, the sum would be (2^k)^2 + (2^k)^2 + (2^k)^2 = 3*4^k. But if we can group these bits into a single number, then that number would have 3 * 2^k (if possible?), but no. Because each number can only have 0 or 1 in that bit position. So grouping them into a single number is not possible. Because a bit in a number is either set or not set. So for bit k, if the total count is 3, you can't have three set bits in a single number. So each of the three set bits must be in different numbers. So the sum of squares for that bit is 3*(2^k)^2.

But wait, each occurrence of the bit in a number contributes (2^k) to that number. So the sum of squares for that bit's contribution is the sum over all numbers of (bit's presence * 2^k)^2. So for each occurrence of the bit in a number, it's (2^k)^2. So for three occurrences, the sum is 3*(2^k)^2. But if the three bits are in three different numbers, then each contributes (2^k)^2, sum 3*4^k. If two bits are in one number and one in another, then the sum is ( (2^k + 2^k)^2 ) + (2^k)^2 ) = (2*2^k)^2 + (2^k)^2 = 4*4^k + 4^k =5*4^k. Which is higher than 3*4^k. So in this case, grouping two bits into the same number increases the sum. Wait, but how can two bits of the same position be in the same number? Because each number can have 0 or 1 in that bit. So each bit can only appear once in a number.

Ah! Right. Because a bit in a number is either 0 or 1. So each number can have at most one occurrence of a particular bit. So for example, if the total count of a bit is 3, then exactly three numbers have that bit set. So regardless of how we arrange the bits, each occurrence is in a different number. So the sum of squares for that bit's contribution is 3*(2^k)^2. But this is fixed. Because you cannot group multiple occurrences of the same bit into a single number. So the sum of squares for each individual bit's contribution is fixed as c_k * 4^k.

Therefore, the only variable part of the sum of squares comes from the cross terms between different bits in the same numbers. So the maximum sum of squares is achieved when as many pairs of different bits as possible are in the same number.

Thus, the problem reduces to arranging the bits (for each position) into the numbers such that the sum of cross terms (between different bits in the same number) is maximized.

So how to maximize the sum of 2 * 2^i * 2^j for every pair of bits i and j that are present in the same number. The total sum of cross terms is sum_{i < j} [ (number of numbers that have both bits i and j) * 2 * 2^i * 2^j ].

So to maximize this sum, we need to maximize the number of numbers that have as many pairs of bits as possible. The best way to do this is to have as many bits as possible concentrated into as few numbers as possible. For example, if we can have a single number that has all the bits, then every pair of bits contributes to the cross terms. But given that each bit's count is c_k (the total number of times it appears across all numbers), how can we arrange the bits into numbers to maximize the number of pairs?

For example, suppose we have three bits: bit 1, bit 2, bit 3. Let's say each has a count of 1. Then, if we arrange all three bits into one number, the cross terms for all pairs (1-2, 1-3, 2-3) would be 2*(2^1*2^2 + 2^1*2^3 + 2^2*2^3). If we arrange them into separate numbers, then there are no cross terms. So the maximum is achieved by grouping them into one number.

But if the counts are higher, like bit 1 has count 2, bit 2 has count 3. Then, how to arrange them to maximize the cross terms?

The key idea is that for each bit, the number of numbers that have that bit set is exactly c_k (since each number can have at most one occurrence of that bit). So for each bit k, there are exactly c_k numbers that have the bit set. Now, to maximize the number of pairs of bits i and j that are in the same number, we can arrange the bits such that whenever possible, two different bits are placed into the same number.

But how?

This seems like a matching problem. Let's think of the bits as items, and for each bit i, we have c_i instances. We need to distribute these instances into numbers (each number can be a collection of bits) such that each instance of a bit is in a different number, and for each number, the bits in it contribute to cross terms. To maximize the sum of cross terms, we want to arrange the bits such that the same numbers contain as many different bits as possible.

An optimal approach is to distribute the bits such that the numbers are filled with as many different bits as possible, given their counts.

For example, consider the counts for each bit. Let's sort the bits in decreasing order of their counts. Then, for each position, we create a number that includes as many bits as possible. But how?

This sounds similar to the problem of maximizing the sum of cross terms by arranging items into groups. This is analogous to the problem where you have a set of elements, and you want to group them into bins such that the sum of the products of all pairs in each bin is maximized.

In that problem, the optimal solution is to make as many groups as possible with as many elements as possible. For example, if you have elements a, b, c, with counts 3, 2, 2, then you want to form groups that contain all three elements. But since each element has a certain count, the number of groups for each element is fixed. So the maximum number of groups that can contain all three elements is the minimum of their counts. Then, the remaining elements are grouped into pairs, etc.

In our case, each group (number) can contain multiple bits. The cross terms for each group are the sum over all pairs of bits in the group multiplied by 2 * 2^i * 2^j. So the goal is to create groups with as many bits as possible.

Thus, the optimal way is to arrange the bits into numbers in such a way that the numbers with the most bits possible are created first. This is equivalent to taking the bits with the highest counts and combining them with other bits.

So, the algorithm is as follows:

1. For each bit position, compute the count c_k (number of times it is set across all input numbers).

2. Sort the bits in descending order of their counts. This is because bits with higher counts are more valuable to group together.

3. Then, for each position in the sorted list, we create as many numbers as possible that include this bit and as many other bits as possible. But how?

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as for each number, we can assign any subset of bits (each appearing once) to it, and the count of how many times a bit is used is exactly c_k. So the problem is to assign the bits to numbers such that each number can have multiple bits, but each bit can be assigned to at most c_k numbers.

The sum to maximize is sum_{numbers} (sum_{bits in number} 2^bit)^2.

Expanding this sum, it's equal to sum_{bit} c_k * 4^bit + 2 * sum_{i < j} (number of times bits i and j are in the same number) * 2^i * 2^j.

The first part is fixed, so the goal is to maximize the second part.

The second part is 2 * sum_{i < j} (x_{i,j}) * (2^i * 2^j), where x_{i,j} is the number of numbers that contain both bits i and j.

So the problem reduces to maximizing the sum of x_{i,j} * (2^i * 2^j) for all i < j.

To maximize this, for each pair (i,j), x_{i,j} should be as large as possible. But x_{i,j} is bounded by the minimum of c_i and c_j, because each time bits i and j are together in a number, they must be placed in the same number. However, after placing them once, the available counts for each bit are reduced by 1.

But this is similar to the problem of maximizing the sum of products of pairs, given that each element has a certain number of occurrences.

The optimal strategy here is to greedily pair the bits with the highest remaining counts first. This is because the product (2^i * 2^j) is larger for higher bits, so we want to maximize the number of times higher pairs are placed together.

But how to model this? Let's think of the counts as a priority queue. For each step, we take the two bits with the highest remaining counts, create a number that contains them, and decrement their counts by 1. Repeat until all counts are zero. But this is not exactly correct, because a number can contain more than two bits. For example, if there are three bits with high counts, combining them into a single number would contribute three pairs (i,j), (i,k), (j,k) in one step.

But in terms of maximizing the sum, adding a third bit to a pair would add more pairs. So the optimal approach is to create numbers with as many bits as possible, combining the highest remaining counts each time.

But how to model this? This seems complicated. Let's think of another way. For each bit, its count is the number of numbers it's present in. So for each bit k, it appears in exactly c_k numbers. Each such number can contain any combination of other bits, but each other bit j can be in at most c_j numbers.

The problem is equivalent to creating a matrix where each row represents a number, and each column represents a bit. The entry is 1 if the number contains the bit, 0 otherwise. The sum we want to maximize is the sum over all pairs (i,j) of (number of rows where both i and j are 1) multiplied by (2^i * 2^j).

This is equivalent to the sum over all pairs (i,j) of (min(c_i, c_j, overlapping_counts)), but how to maximize this overlapping count.

This is similar to the problem of maximizing the sum of overlaps between pairs of sets. Here, each bit's set is the numbers where it appears. The overlap is the size of the intersection of the sets for bits i and j. To maximize the sum of overlaps multiplied by their products (2^i * 2^j), we want the sets for higher product pairs to have as much overlap as possible.

But how to model this? It's a complex combinatorial problem. However, there's a greedy approach that can be taken. For each number, we include as many high-value bits as possible. High-value here refers to the product 2^i * 2^j for the pairs they form. But since higher bits have larger products, it's better to pair higher bits together.

But another approach is to think that for each number, we can assign as many bits as possible, starting from the highest bits down. For example, take the bit with the highest remaining count, then the next, and so on, until all counts are zero.

But how does this work? Let's consider an example. Suppose we have counts for three bits: c1=3, c2=2, c3=2. So:

- The first number will have bits 1, 2, 3. Counts become 2,1,1.

- The next number will have bits 1, 2, 3. Counts become 1,0,0.

- The next number will have bit 1. Count becomes 0.

So, the sum of overlaps for pairs (1,2) is 2 (they are together in two numbers), (1,3) 2, (2,3) 2. For pairs (2,3), their count is 2. So the contribution for those pairs is 2 * 2^2 * 2^3 = 2*4*8=64. For (1,2), 2*2*4=16. Wait, 2^i * 2^j where i=1 and j=2 is 2*4=8. Multiply by 2 (overlap) gives 16.

But if we instead create two numbers with bits 1, 2, 3, then the counts for 1 is 2, 2 is 1, 3 is 1. Then another two numbers: one with 1, and another with 1. But how?

Alternatively, the way to maximize the overlaps is to create as many numbers as possible that include the maximum possible bits.

But how to implement this? Let's think about the counts as a frequency array, sorted in non-increasing order. We can process the counts and create for each possible number the maximum possible bits.

The optimal way is to arrange the bits into the numbers such that the number of overlapping pairs is maximized, which would be achieved when the same group of bits is used as much as possible.

So, the steps could be:

1. Sort the counts in non-increasing order.

2. For each position from 0 to the maximum count of any bit:

   a. For each bit, if its count is greater than or equal to the current position, include it in the current number.

3. For each number created in this way, compute the sum of squares.

But how does this work? Let's take the example where counts are [3,2,2]. The maximum count is 3.

At position 0 (the first number), include all bits with count >= 1. All three bits are included. Then, their counts are decremented by 1. But how to model this.

Alternatively, the number of numbers that contain the first k bits is equal to the minimum of their counts. For example, if we have bits A, B, C with counts 3, 2, 2. The first two numbers will contain all three bits. Then, for the third number, only bit A is left (count 1). So the total pairs for A and B are 2 (from the first two numbers), pairs A and C are 2, pairs B and C are 2. Then, in the third number, there's no pairs. So the sum of pairs is 2*(A&B) + 2*(A&C) + 2*(B&C), plus the individual squares.

This approach seems to maximize the overlaps for the higher counts.

So the algorithm is:

- Sort the bits in non-increasing order of their counts.

- For each level from 0 to max_count -1:

   - Take all bits that have a count greater than the current level.

   - For each such bit, this level contributes to one number.

   - So, the number of numbers that have exactly these bits is equal to 1, but for each level, the numbers formed are those bits with count > level.

For example, counts sorted as [3,2,2]. The levels are 0,1,2.

At level 0: bits A, B, C. So one number with all three bits. This is level 0.

At level 1: bits A, B, C. So another number with all three bits. Level 1.

At level 2: bits A. So a number with only A. Level 2.

So each level represents the i-th occurrence of the bits. So for a bit with count c, it appears in all levels from 0 to c-1.

Each level corresponds to a number. The number at level i includes all bits that have count > i.

Thus, for each level i, the number includes all bits where c_k > i.

So, the sum of squares can be computed as the sum over all levels (numbers) of the square of the sum of 2^k for each bit included in that level.

The sum of squares for each number is (sum of 2^k for bits in the number)^2. Summing this for all numbers gives the maximum possible sum of squares.

Let me test this with the example from the problem.

Sample input 2:

3

1 3 5 → [1, 3,5]. Binary representations:

1: 001

3: 011

5: 101

The counts for each bit:

Bit 0 (1): 1 (appears in 1,3,5? Wait, 1 is 001 → bit 0 is set. 3 is 011 → bits 0 and 1 set. 5 is 101 → bits 0 and 2 set. So for each bit:

Bit 0: count is 3 (appears in 1,3,5).

Bit 1: count is 2 (appears in 3, which is 11, and also in 3's bit 1 and 1's bit 0? Wait, no. Let's list the bits:

Each number is a_i, so let's break down the bits for each a_i:

1 → binary 001: bits 0.

3 → binary 011: bits 0 and 1.

5 → binary 101: bits 0 and 2.

So counts per bit:

Bit 0: 3 (all three numbers have bit 0 set).

Bit 1: 1 (only 3 has bit 1 set).

Bit 2: 1 (only 5 has bit 2 set).

Other bits: 0.

So sorted counts in non-increasing order are 3 (bit 0), then 1 (bit 1), 1 (bit 2).

The levels are from 0 to 2 (max count is 3, levels 0,1,2).

For each level:

Level 0: bits with count >0 → bits 0,1,2. So the first number is sum of 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 =1+2+4=7 → square 49.

Level 1: bits with count>1 → only bit 0. Sum is 1 → square 1.

Level 2: bits with count>2 → none. So sum is 0 → square 0.

So total sum is 49 +1 +0 + (sum of individual bits) ?

Wait, no. Wait, each level represents a number. But the counts are being handled as follows. For each bit k, the number of times it is included in the numbers is equal to its count. Because for a count of c_k, the bit is included in levels 0 to c_k-1. So for each level i, the bit is present if i < c_k.

So for bit 0 with count 3: present in levels 0,1,2 → three numbers.

Bit 1 (count 1): present in level 0 → one number.

Bit 2 (count 1): present in level 0 → one number.

So the numbers are:

Level 0: bits 0,1,2 → 7 → square 49.

Level 1: bit 0 → 1 → square 1.

Level 2: bit 0 →1 → square 1.

So total sum is 49 +1 +1 =51, which matches the sample output.

Another example: sample input 3:

2

349525 699050 → which are 349525 = binary 1010101010101010101 (17 bits), 699050 = binary 10101010101010101010 (18 bits). The sum of the two numbers is 349525 + 699050 = 1,048,575 = 2^20-1.

After the operation, according to the sample, the sum of squares is 1099509530625. Which is (349525 +699050)^2 = (1,048,575)^2 = 1099509530625. Which is the sum of squares when they are combined into a single number (since after one operation, the two numbers become 349525 AND 699050 and 349525 OR 699050. Let's compute that:

349525 in binary is 1010101010101010101 (19 bits?), 699050 is 10101010101010101010 (20 bits). So AND is 1010101010101010101 & 10101010101010101010. Let's see: the first number has 19 bits, the second 20. So leading 0 in the first. The AND would be 0 where the second number has a 1 in the 20th bit. But perhaps the two numbers are such that their OR is 1,048,575, and the AND is zero. Because 349525 is 1010101010101010101, and 699050 is 10101010101010101010. So the first is shifted left by one (plus a zero at the end). So AND is zero, OR is 101010101010101010111 (which is 1,048,575). So after the operation, the two numbers become 0 and 1,048,575. The sum of squares is 0^2 + (1,048,575)^2 = 1,048,575^2 = sample output. So according to our approach, let's see:

The counts for each bit. Both numbers have bits set in every other position. For example, 349525 is 1010101010101010101 (bits 0, 2, 4, ..., 18). 699050 is 10101010101010101010 (bits 1, 3, 5, ..., 19). So for each bit position from 0 to 19:

Bits 0: count 1 (only 349525 has it).

Bit 1: count 1 (only 699050).

Bit 2: count 1 (349525).

Bit 3: count 1 (699050).

And so on. So for all bits from 0 to 19, each has a count of 1. So sorted counts are all 1's. So levels are 0 (max count is 1, levels 0).

Each level 0 has all 20 bits. So the sum for this number is sum of all 2^k for k=0 to 19. Which is 2^20 -1 = 1,048,575. Square is (2^20-1)^2. So sum of squares is 1^2 for each bit (but no, wait: the sum of squares for this number is (sum of bits)^2 = (2^20-1)^2. There are no other numbers, since each bit's count is 1. So the total sum of squares is exactly (2^20-1)^2, which matches the sample.

So this approach seems to work.

Thus, the algorithm is:

- For each bit position, compute the count c_k.

- Sort the counts in non-increasing order.

- For each level from 0 to (max_count - 1), create a number that includes all bits whose count is greater than the current level.

- For each such number, compute its square and sum them all.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute the count of each bit.

2. Sort the counts in descending order.

3. The maximum possible level is the maximum count minus 1.

4. For each level from 0 to max_level:

   a. Sum all 2^k where the bit's count is greater than the level.

   b. Square this sum and add to the total.

This approach ensures that all bits are grouped into numbers in such a way that higher bits are grouped together as much as possible, maximizing the cross terms.

Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently. Given that n can be up to 2e5 and bits up to 2^20, we need an efficient way to compute the counts for each bit.

Implementation steps:

- Read the input numbers.

- For each number, compute which bits are set and increment the count for those bits.

- Sort the counts in descending order.

- Find the maximum count (the first element in the sorted list).

- For each level from 0 to (max_count -1), compute the sum of 2^k for each bit where c_k > level.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The sorted counts are in non-increasing order. So for level i, the sum includes all bits up to a certain index where c_k > i.

Since the counts are sorted, for each i, we can find the largest j where c[j] > i. All bits up to j are included.

But for each level i, the number of bits that have count >i is the number of elements in the sorted counts that are >i.

So for each i, we can compute the sum of 2^bit for those bits where count >i.

But the problem is that the bits are sorted by count, not by their actual bit positions. So the order of the counts does not correspond to their bit values. So when we compute the sum for a level, the bits included are those with counts >i, but their actual bit positions are not necessarily contiguous.

But how can we track the sum for each level?

Wait, the sum for each level is the sum of 2^b for each bit b where the count of b is greater than the current level. However, the bits are not ordered by their value. For example, a bit with higher value may have a lower count and thus appear later in the sorted list.

So, for each level i, we need to sum all 2^b where the count of b is >i. The sorted list of counts is in descending order, but the associated bits are not ordered. So the sum for level i is the sum of 2^b for all bits where their count is greater than i.

Thus, to compute this sum for each level, we need to know all bits whose count is greater than i.

But if we have the counts sorted in descending order, then for each i, the bits with count >i are the first k bits in the sorted list where their count >i.

But no, because the sorted list is in descending order, but the i can be such that the first few bits have counts >i, then others.

For example, sorted counts are [3,2,2,1]. For i=2, the first two bits (3 and 2) are greater than i=2? No. 3>2, 2 is not. So the first bit (count 3) is >i=2. The other bits are 2, 2, 1, which are not. So for i=2, the sum is 2^b for the first bit.

But how do we track which bits have counts greater than i for each level i?

An alternative approach is to precompute for each bit, all the levels where it is included. For each bit b with count c, it is included in levels 0 to c-1. So for each level i, if i < c, then the bit is included.

But the sum for level i is the sum of 2^b for all bits where i < c.

Thus, the sum for level i is the sum of 2^b for all bits where c_b >i.

But how to compute this efficiently for all levels i from 0 to max_c-1.

The naive approach is, for each level i, iterate through all bits and add 2^b if c_b >i. But for n up to 2e5 and max_c up to 2e5, this would be O(max_c * m), where m is the number of bits (up to 20). But 2e5 * 20 is 4e6, which is acceptable.

But wait, the maximum possible count for a bit is up to 2e5 (since n can be 2e5 and each of the n numbers could have that bit set). So max_c can be up to 2e5, but for each level i from 0 to max_c-1, the loop would run max_c times. For max_c=2e5, this is 2e5 iterations, each needing to loop through all bits (20 bits). So 2e5 *20=4e6 operations, which is manageable.

So the steps are:

- Compute for each bit (0..19) its count.

- For each level i from 0 to (max_count-1):

   - sum = 0

   - for each bit in 0..19:

      - if count[bit] >i:

          sum += 2^bit

   - add sum^2 to the result.

- sum all the squares for each level.

But this is manageable.

But in Python, even 4e6 operations are acceptable. Let's test with the sample input 3. Let's see:

Sample input 3:

n=2

Numbers are 349525 and 699050.

We compute the count for each bit. Let's see:

349525 in binary is 1010101010101010101 (19 bits):

Bits set at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., 18 (even positions).

699050 is 10101010101010101010 (20 bits):

Bits set at positions 1,3,5,...,19 (odd positions).

So counts for each bit:

even positions (0,2,4,...,18): count 1 each.

odd positions (1,3,5,...,19): count 1 each.

So total 20 bits with count 1 each.

Sorted counts: 20 times 1.

max_count is 1. So levels are 0 to 0 (only level 0).

For level 0:

sum includes all bits with count >0 → all 20 bits. Sum is sum(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^19) = 2^20 -1. Square is (2^20-1)^2, which is the sample output.

Thus, the algorithm works.

Another example: sample input 2:

counts are 3,1,1 (bit 0, 1, 2). Sorted as 3,1,1.

max_count is 3 → levels 0,1,2.

Level 0: sum bits with count>0 → all three bits. Sum 1+2+4=7. Square 49.

Level 1: count>1 → only bit 0 (count 3>1). sum 1. Square 1.

Level 2: count>2 → no bits (bit 0 has count 3>2, so sum 1. Square 1.

Sum is 49 +1 +1=51.

Thus, the algorithm works.

So the steps are:

1. Read the input numbers.

2. For each number, iterate through its bits and increment the count for each set bit.

3. Collect all counts for bits 0..19.

4. Sort the counts in descending order.

5. Find the maximum count (first element in sorted list).

6. For each level i from 0 to max_count-1:

   a. Compute the sum of 2^b for each bit where count[b] >i.

   b. Add (sum)^2 to the result.

7. Output the result.

But wait, after step 4, we have the counts sorted in descending order, but the actual bits are not stored. Because when we sort the counts, we lose track of which bit corresponds to which count. For example, if we have counts [3,1,1], we don't know which bits those are. So for step 6a, how do we determine which bits have count>i?

Ah, here's the problem. Sorting the counts and then losing track of which bit they belong to. Because when we sort the counts in descending order, we don't track which bit they are for. So the algorithm I described earlier is incorrect.

Wait, the counts are stored per bit. So each count is associated with a specific bit position. For example, count[0] is the number of times bit 0 is set, count[1] for bit 1, etc. So when we sort the counts in descending order, but lose the association with the bits, we can't compute the sum for each level.

This is a critical mistake. So the previous approach is flawed.

So the correct approach must not sort the counts, but instead, for each level i, we need to sum all bits where their count is greater than i. The order in which the counts are processed does not affect the sum, but for each bit, its count is checked individually.

So the correct algorithm is:

1. For each bit position (0 to 19), compute the count of how many numbers have that bit set.

2. The maximum count is the maximum of these counts.

3. For each level i from 0 to (max_count -1):

   a. Compute the sum of 2^bit for each bit where count[bit] >i.

   b. Add this sum squared to the result.

Thus, the sorted order of the counts is irrelevant. We need to check each bit's count individually for each level.

So the steps are:

For each level i, we check all 20 bits to see if their count is >i. If yes, add 2^bit to the sum for that level.

The maximum possible level is the maximum count minus 1. So for example, if the maximum count is 3, then levels are 0,1,2.

Thus, the implementation steps in code are:

- Read n.

- Read the list of a_i.

- For each bit in 0..19, compute count[bit] as the number of a_i that have that bit set.

- Compute max_count = max(count).

- result =0.

- For i in 0 to max_count -1:

   current_sum =0

   for bit in 0..19:

       if count[bit] >i:

           current_sum += (1 << bit)

   result += current_sum * current_sum

- Output result.

This is correct. Because for each level i, the current_sum is the sum of all bits that are present in at least (i+1) numbers. Thus, each such bit is added to exactly i+1 numbers. And for each level, the sum is squared and added to the result.

Let's verify this with sample input 2:

count for bit 0 is 3, bits 1 and 2 are 1.

max_count is 3. Levels 0,1,2.

Level 0:

current_sum = 1 + 2 +4=7. Square 49.

Level 1:

bit 0's count is 3>1 → yes. bits 1 and 2 are count 1 which is not >1. So sum=1. Square 1.

Level 2:

bit 0's count is 3>2 → yes. others are 1>2 → no. sum=1. Square 1.

Total 49+1+1=51.

Which matches.

Another example:

Sample input 3. For each of the 20 bits (0-19), count is 1. max_count is 1. So levels 0.

Level 0:

sum is sum of 2^0 to 2^19. Which is 2^20-1. Square is (2^20-1)^2.

Correct.

Sample input 1: n=1, a=123. So count for each bit is 1 if bit is set in 123. The binary of 123 is 64+32+16+8+2+1= 64+32=96, +16=112, +8=120, +2+1=123. So bits 0,1,3,4,5,6 are set (since 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64). So counts for these bits are 1. max_count is 1. Level 0:

sum is 123 (sum of all set bits). Square is 123^2=15129. Correct.

Thus, the correct algorithm is as follows.

In Python, this can be implemented efficiently as follows:

Read n.

Read the list of a_i.

Initialize a count array of size 20 (since a_i <2^20) to zero.

For each number in a_i:

   for each bit from 0 to 19:

       if the number has that bit set, increment count[bit].

Compute max_count as the maximum of the count array.

Initialize result=0.

For i in 0 to max_count-1:

   current_sum =0

   for bit in 0..19:

       if count[bit] >i:

           current_sum += (1 << bit)

   result += current_sum * current_sum

Print(result)

Now, let's check the time complexity.

For each test case:

- Reading the n numbers: O(n).

- For each number, checking 20 bits: O(n*20).

- Finding max_count: O(20).

- Then, for each level i up to max_count-1, which can be up to 2e5 (if a bit is set in all n=2e5 numbers), for each of these levels, loop 20 bits.

So time complexity is O(n*20 + max_count *20).

In the worst case, n=2e5 and max_count=2e5. Then, total operations are 2e5*20 + 2e5*20 = 8e6, which is acceptable.

But wait, if n=2e5, and all numbers have a certain bit set, then count[bit] =2e5. So max_count=2e5. Then, the loop runs 2e5 times, each checking 20 bits. 2e5 *20 =4e6 operations, which is manageable.

Thus, this approach is efficient and correct.

So the Python code would be:

Read n.

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    count = [0] * 20

    for num in a:

       for b in range(20):

           if num & (1 << b):

               count[b] +=1

    max_count = max(count) if count else 0

    res =0

    for i in range(max_count):

       current =0

       for b in range(20):

           if count[b] >i:

               current += (1 << b)

       res += current * current

    print(res, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

""",
            "output": \
"""\

""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

```

Another sample: input3.

count array for bits 0-19 is all 1.

max_count=1. loop i=0.

sum all bits 0-19 → sum is 2^20-1. square is correct.

Thus, code works.

Thus, the code is correct.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
count = [0] * 20

for num in a:
    for b in range(20):
        if num & (1 << b):
            count[b] += 1

max_count = max(count) if count else 0
res = 0

for i in range(max_count):
    current = 0
    for b in range(20):
        if count[b] > i:
            current += (1 << b)
    res += current * current

print(res)
```
