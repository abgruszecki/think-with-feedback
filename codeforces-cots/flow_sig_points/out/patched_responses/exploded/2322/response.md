Okay, let's try to solve this problem. The task is to find the longest subarray where the bitwise AND of all elements is greater than the XOR of all elements. Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to understand the properties of AND and XOR in subarrays. Let's think about what conditions make a subarray good. The AND of the subarray must be larger than the XOR. But how can that happen?

Wait, bitwise operations can be tricky. Let's think in terms of the highest set bit. For the AND to be greater than the XOR, there must be a bit position where the AND has a 1 and the XOR has a 0, and all higher bits are the same in both. But maybe a better approach is to analyze when AND > XOR.

Let's consider a single element. For a subarray of length 1, the AND is the element itself, and the XOR is also the element. So the condition is a_i > a_i, which is false. So all single-element subarrays are invalid. Therefore, the minimum possible valid subarray length is 2.

So the problem reduces to checking subarrays of length >=2. Now, the question is how to find the longest such subarray efficiently, given the constraints of up to 1e6 elements.

Brute-force approach is O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible for n=1e6. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the AND and XOR properties. The AND of a subarray is always less than or equal to the minimum element in the subarray. Because each AND operation can only turn bits off. So, as the subarray grows, the AND can stay the same or decrease. On the other hand, the XOR can vary a lot, but for longer subarrays, the XOR might not accumulate in a predictable way.

But how can the AND be greater than the XOR? Let's think of some examples.

Take the first sample input: 5 and 6. 5 is 101, 6 is 110. The AND is 4 (100), the XOR is 3 (011). So 4>3. So for two elements, the AND is a bitwise AND of the two, and the XOR is the XOR. So in this case, the AND is higher.

Another example: the third test case. The subarray [1,3,3,1]. AND is 1 & 3 &3 &1. Let's compute that:

1 in binary is 0001. 3 is 0011. AND of 1 and 3 is 0001. Then AND with 3 again is 0001. AND with 1 again is 0001. So the AND is 1. The XOR is 1 ^3 ^3 ^1. Let's compute step by step: 1^3 is 2 (0010), then XOR with 3 gives 1 (0001), XOR with 1 gives 0. So 1>0. So this is a good subarray.

So in this case, the AND is 1, which is the same as the AND of all elements. The XOR ends up being 0. So how does that happen?

I notice that when the number of elements in the subarray is even, especially when some elements cancel each other's XOR. For example, pairs of elements that XOR to 0. But maybe the key here is that the AND of the entire subarray is higher than the XOR.

Hmm. So what's the pattern here? Let's think about the bits.

Suppose that in a subarray, the AND has a bit set that is higher than the highest bit set in the XOR. Then the AND would be larger. For example, if the AND has the highest bit at position k, and the XOR has all bits below that. Then AND would be larger.

But how can this happen? For the AND to have a certain bit set, all elements in the subarray must have that bit set. So the AND of the subarray will have all bits that are common to all elements. So the highest bit set in the AND is the highest bit that is common to all elements in the subarray.

The XOR of the subarray will have bits up to some highest bit. So for the AND to be greater than the XOR, the highest bit in the AND must be higher than the highest bit in the XOR. Because if the AND's highest bit is higher, then regardless of lower bits, the AND is larger.

So, if the AND's highest bit is higher than the XOR's highest bit, then the condition is satisfied. So the problem reduces to finding a subarray where the common highest bit (i.e., the highest bit set in the AND of all elements of the subarray) is higher than the highest bit set in the XOR of the subarray.

So how can we find such subarrays?

Let me approach this step by step.

First, for any subarray, the AND's highest bit is the maximum bit that is set in all elements of the subarray. Let's call this bit 'k'. Then, for the XOR of the subarray, its highest bit must be less than k.

Because if the XOR's highest bit is less than k, then the AND is at least 2^k, and the XOR is at most 2^{k} -1. So the AND would be larger.

So the key is to find the maximum k such that there exists a subarray of length >=2 where all elements have bit k set, and the XOR of the subarray has its highest bit less than k.

So the plan is to find for each possible bit k (from 30 down to 0, since a_i can be up to 1e6 which is less than 2^20 but let's say up to 2^20), check if there exists a subarray where all elements have bit k set, and the XOR of the subarray has highest bit <k. Then, among all such possible k's, the largest possible subarray length is our answer.

But how to compute this efficiently.

So first, for each possible bit k (starting from highest to lowest), we can check all possible subarrays where all elements have bit k set. Then, among those subarrays, check if their XOR's highest bit is less than k. If such a subarray exists, then the maximum possible answer for this k is the maximum length of such a subarray, and since we are checking from higher k to lower, once we find a k where the maximum subarray length is m, we can stop and return m as the answer (since higher k's would yield higher possible ANDs, and thus better answer).

Wait, but even if a higher k has a shorter maximum length, maybe a lower k has a longer maximum length. For example, suppose k=3 has a maximum subarray length of 4, and k=2 has a maximum of 5. Then even though k=3 is higher, the answer is 5. So that approach might not work.

So perhaps the correct approach is to check for each bit k (from highest to lowest), compute the maximum length of a subarray where all elements have bit k set, and the XOR of the subarray has highest bit less than k. Then take the maximum over all such k's.

But how do we check for this efficiently?

Alternatively, for each possible k, find the maximum length of a subarray where all elements have bit k set, and then compute the XOR for such subarrays and check if any of them has XOR with highest bit <k. The maximum possible length for such a subarray would be the maximum possible answer for that k. Then, the overall answer is the maximum among all k's.

But even this approach could be expensive if we process each k separately.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given k, all elements in the subarray must have bit k set. Then, the AND for the subarray will have bit k set (since all elements have it). The XOR of the subarray could have a highest bit that is less than k. If that's the case, then the AND is at least 2^k, and the XOR is less than 2^k, so AND > XOR. So the problem reduces to finding for each k, the maximum length of a subarray where all elements have bit k set, and the XOR's highest bit is <k. Then, the answer is the maximum of such lengths over all k.

So the plan is:

1. For each bit k from 30 down to 0:

   a. Collect all the elements that have bit k set. Then, the subarrays to consider are those that are contiguous in the original array and consist entirely of elements with bit k set.

   b. For each such subarray, compute the XOR. If the highest bit of the XOR is less than k, then this subarray is valid. We need the maximum length of such a subarray.

   c. For each contiguous block of elements with bit k set (i.e., runs in the original array where all elements in the run have bit k set), we need to find the maximum length of a subarray within this run where the XOR's highest bit is less than k.

   d. The maximum across all such runs for this k is a candidate for the answer. If for this k, there exists at least one such subarray, then the candidate is the maximum length found. Then, since k is considered from highest to lowest, once we find a candidate, we can compare it with the maximum found so far. But since a higher k's candidate may be shorter than a lower k's, we need to check all k's and take the maximum.

2. The overall maximum candidate across all k's is the answer. If no candidate exists, return 0.

But how to compute step 1b and 1c efficiently?

First, for each k, collect the runs where all elements in the run have bit k set. For example, for the array [8,1,3,3,1,2], and k=0 (bit 0 is the least significant bit). Elements with bit 0 set are 1,3,3,1. So the runs would be [1,3,3,1], but perhaps broken into contiguous blocks. Wait, in this array, the elements are 8 (1000), 1 (0001), 3 (0011), 3 (0011), 1 (0001), 2 (0010). So for bit 0 (LSB), the elements 1,3,3,1 have bit 0 set. So the run is from index 1 to 4 (0-based?), so the subarrays within this run would be of length 2,3,4. For each of these, compute the XOR and check if the highest bit is less than k (which in this case is 0). Wait, but k=0. So the XOR must have highest bit less than 0, which is impossible. So the condition can't be satisfied for k=0. Hmm, but in the sample input 3, the valid subarray is [1,3,3,1], which is for k=0. Let's check the XOR: 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 1 = 0. The highest bit is 0 (since 0 has no bits set). So highest bit is -infinity? So in that case, the highest bit of the XOR is less than k=0. So how is that possible?

Wait, the highest bit of 0 is undefined. So perhaps for the XOR being 0, the highest bit is considered as -1. So for k=0, the XOR's highest bit is -1, which is less than k=0. So the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the subarray is valid.

So in this case, for k=0, the run is length 4. The XOR is 0. So the condition is met, so the subarray is valid, hence the maximum length is 4.

But when k=0, the AND of the subarray would be 1 &3 &3 &1 = 1. The XOR is 0. So 1>0. Which is correct.

So for k=0, the subarray's AND is at least 1 (since all elements have bit 0 set). The XOR's highest bit is -1 (if it's zero), which is less than k=0. So the condition is satisfied.

So for each run in the array where all elements have bit k set, we need to find the maximum possible length of a subarray (>=2) where the XOR of the subarray has all bits <=k-1. Because the highest bit must be <k.

Wait, the highest bit in the XOR of the subarray must be less than k. So, the XOR's value must be less than 2^k.

But how can we check that?

Alternatively, the XOR of the subarray must have all bits above or equal to k as 0.

Wait, perhaps the XOR's value is less than 2^k. So for any subarray where the XOR is less than 2^k, and the AND has bit k set (so the AND is at least 2^k), then AND > XOR.

So for a subarray where all elements have bit k set, the AND will have bit k set (since all elements have it). So the AND is at least 2^k. The XOR of the subarray is some value. If that value is less than 2^k, then the AND (>=2^k) is larger than the XOR (which is <2^k). So the condition is satisfied.

So the key insight is: for a subarray where all elements have bit k set, the condition holds if the XOR of the subarray is less than 2^k. Because in that case, the AND is >= 2^k (since all elements have bit k set), and the XOR is less than 2^k. So AND > XOR.

So the problem reduces to, for each k, find the maximum length of a subarray consisting of elements all with bit k set, and the XOR of the subarray is less than 2^k. The maximum such length over all k is the answer.

This is a crucial realization. Because now, for each k, we can process all possible runs of elements with bit k set, and for each such run, find the maximum possible subarray length where the XOR is less than 2^k.

So how do we compute this efficiently?

First, for each k, collect all the runs of consecutive elements with bit k set. Then, for each run, we need to find the maximum subarray length (>=2) where the cumulative XOR from the start to some end is less than 2^k.

Wait, the XOR is a cumulative operation. But XOR is not like addition. So cumulative XOR can be computed using a prefix XOR array. Let's think.

Let's consider a run of elements with bit k set. Let this run consist of elements x_1, x_2, ..., x_m. We need to find a subarray x_i to x_j (i <=j) of length at least 2 (so j-i+1 >=2) such that the XOR of x_i to x_j is less than 2^k. The maximum j-i+1 for such a subarray.

But the problem is that for each run, we need to find the maximum possible j-i+1 where the XOR from i to j is less than 2^k.

How can we compute this efficiently?

Let's consider that the prefix XOR array for the run. Let prefix_xor[0] =0, and prefix_xor[i] = x_1 XOR x_2 XOR ... XOR x_i.

Then, the XOR of the subarray from i to j (1-based in the run) is prefix_xor[j] XOR prefix_xor[i-1]. So for this to be less than 2^k.

But for each j in the run, we need to find the earliest i-1 such that (prefix_xor[j] XOR prefix_xor[i-1]) < 2^k. Then, the maximum j - (i) +1 would be j - (i) +1 = j - i +1 = (j - (i-1)).

But how to find such i's efficiently.

Alternatively, for each j, we can look for the smallest i such that prefix_xor[i] XOR prefix_xor[j] < 2^k. But this seems challenging.

Another approach: Since all elements in the run have bit k set, each x in the run has x >= 2^k (since the k-th bit is set). But that's not necessarily true, because other bits could be set. For example, 3 has bits 0 and 1 set, so for k=1, 3 >= 2^1=2.

But the AND of the entire subarray (x_i to x_j) is the AND of all elements, which will have the k-th bit set. So the AND is >= 2^k. And the XOR is some value. So if the XOR is less than 2^k, then the AND (>=2^k) is greater than the XOR (less than 2^k). So the condition is satisfied.

So the problem reduces to finding the longest subarray in each run of elements with bit k set, where the XOR of the subarray is less than 2^k. Then, the maximum of these across all runs and all k's is the answer.

So for each run (contiguous elements with bit k set), we need to find the maximum length of a subarray (>=2) where the XOR is less than 2^k.

But how to compute this?

Let's think about the XOR of the subarray. For a run of elements x_1, x_2, ..., x_m, all with bit k set. The XOR of the entire run (if m is even?) may be zero, but that's not guaranteed. For example, in the third sample, the XOR is zero when the run is four elements.

But the XOR can be any number. However, since all elements have the k-th bit set, the XOR's k-th bit may be 0 or 1, depending on the parity of the count of elements with higher bits set.

Wait, but the XOR of the subarray's bits. Let's think for each bit in the XOR:

The XOR's bit at position k is the parity (even or odd) of the number of elements in the subarray that have the k-th bit set. Because XOR accumulates the count mod 2 for each bit.

But in our case, all elements in the subarray have the k-th bit set, so for the k-th bit in the XOR, the parity is equal to the length of the subarray mod 2. Because each element contributes 1 to the k-th bit. So if the subarray length is even, the k-th bit in the XOR is 0. If it's odd, it's 1.

So for the XOR's k-th bit: it is 1 if the subarray length is odd, else 0.

But the XOR's value is less than 2^k, which implies that all bits >=k are 0. So for the XOR to be less than 2^k, the highest bit must be less than k. So the XOR can have bits set up to (k-1).

But since all elements in the subarray have the k-th bit set, the XOR's k-th bit is the count of elements mod 2. So:

If the subarray length is even, then the k-th bit in XOR is 0. So XOR can be up to 2^k -1 (if higher bits are 0). If the subarray length is even, then the k-th bit is 0, so the XOR is less than 2^k.

If the subarray length is odd, then the k-th bit is 1, so the XOR is at least 2^k. So in that case, the XOR is >=2^k, which means it's not less than 2^k. So the condition (XOR < 2^k) can only be satisfied for even-length subarrays.

Wait, that's an important point. Because if the subarray length is even, then the k-th bit of the XOR is 0. So the XOR is at most (2^k -1) + ... (lower bits). So for even-length subarrays, the XOR can be up to 2^k -1. For odd-length subarrays, the k-th bit is 1, making XOR >= 2^k, which is >= 2^k, so the condition fails.

Therefore, for a subarray in the run (all elements with bit k set), the condition is satisfied if and only if:

- The subarray has even length (so the k-th bit in XOR is 0), and

- The XOR of the subarray is less than 2^k (but since the k-th bit is 0, the maximum possible is 2^k -1, so this is automatically satisfied if the subarray's XOR's highest bit is less than k).

Wait, no. Wait, the XOR's highest bit can be k-1 or lower. So the XOR is less than 2^k. So even-length subarrays automatically have their k-th bit in XOR as 0. So XOR is less than 2^k if and only if the highest bit in XOR is less than k. Which is equivalent to XOR being less than 2^k. So for even-length subarrays, the XOR is automatically less than 2^k if and only if their XOR (with even length) has all bits from k and above as 0. Which is exactly what we need.

Wait, but for even-length subarrays, the k-th bit in the XOR is 0. But there can be higher bits (if any elements have bits higher than k set). But since all elements have bit k set, but higher bits may vary.

Wait, no. Because the elements in the run have bit k set, but higher bits may be set or not. So the XOR of the subarray can have bits higher than k set. For example, suppose in the run, the elements are 3 (11), 3 (11), and the k is 1. The XOR is 0. So that's okay. But if the elements are 3, 5, and the k is 1. Both have bit 1 set. 3 is 11, 5 is 101. XOR of 3 and 5 is 110 (6). The k is 1 (bit 1 is set in both). So the subarray is of length 2 (even). The XOR is 6, which is 110. The highest bit is 2 (since 6 is 110). So the highest bit is 2, which is higher than k=1. So the XOR is 6 >= 2^1 =2. So the condition is not met.

So the conclusion is: even-length subarrays in the run (elements all have bit k set) can have XOR >=2^k if the XOR's highest bit is >=k. Which is possible. So the condition is not automatically satisfied for even-length subarrays.

But how?

Wait, the k-th bit in the XOR is zero (since the subarray length is even). But higher bits (k+1, etc.) can be set. For example, take two elements: 3 (11) and 5 (101). Both have bit 1 set. The XOR is 3 ^5 = 6 (110). So the XOR is 6, which is 110. The highest bit is 2 (since 6 >= 4 (2^2) and <8 (2^3)). So the highest bit is 2. Which is higher than k=1. So the XOR is 6 >= 2^1=2, which is not less than 2^1. So even though the subarray is even-length (2), the XOR is 6 >=2, so the condition is not satisfied.

So the condition for the subarray to be valid is:

- The subarray has even length, and the XOR of the subarray is less than 2^k.

But how do we efficiently find the maximum-length even-length subarray where the XOR is less than 2^k?

Alternatively, for each run of elements with bit k set, we can precompute the prefix XOR array and then look for pairs (i, j) where j-i is even (since j-i+1 is the length, which must be even) and the XOR between i and j is less than 2^k.

But for large runs (like 1e6 elements), this could take O(m^2) time, which is not feasible.

So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, but for even-length subarrays, the length is even. So the subarray can start and end at even positions. Wait, perhaps not. For example, a subarray of even length can start at position 0 and end at position 1 (length 2), which is even.

But how to model this. Let's think of the prefix XOR array. Let's say we have a run of elements x_1, x_2, ..., x_m. The prefix XOR array is P[0] =0, P[1] =x_1, P[2] =x_1 ^x_2, P[3] =x_1^x_2^x_3, etc.

For a subarray from x_i to x_j (indices 1-based in the run), the XOR is P[j] ^ P[i-1].

The length of the subarray is j -i +1. For it to be even, j -i +1 must be even. So j -i must be odd. So i-1 and j must have opposite parity (since (i-1) and j differ by an odd number).

Wait, if i-1 is even, then j must be even + odd = odd. Or something like that. So for the subarray to have even length, i and j must be such that (i-1) and j have opposite parity.

So for the XOR to be less than 2^k, we need P[j] ^ P[i-1] < 2^k.

But how do we find such pairs (i-1, j) where:

1. i-1 and j have opposite parity (so j - (i-1) is odd +1, which is even length).

2. P[j] ^ P[i-1] < 2^k.

We need the maximum j - (i-1) for such pairs.

But for each j, we can look for the earliest i-1 with opposite parity such that P[j] ^ P[i-1] < 2^k. Then, the maximum j - (i-1) is the possible maximum for j.

But how to do this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to split the prefix XOR array into even and odd indices. For each j, if j is even, then we look for i-1 in the odd indices (since j - (i-1) must be odd to get even length), and vice versa.

But even this may not be straightforward.

Alternatively, let's split the prefix XOR into two groups: even positions (indices 0, 2, 4, ...) and odd positions (indices 1, 3, 5, ...).

For each j, depending on whether j is even or odd, we look in the opposite group for the earliest index i-1 such that P[j] ^ P[i-1] < 2^k. The maximum j - (i-1) would be the length of the subarray.

But even this requires for each j to search through the previous group's elements. For m up to 1e6, this would be O(m) per run, which is acceptable.

But how to find, for a given j and group, the earliest index in that group such that P[j] ^ P[index] < 2^k.

But even this is O(m^2) in the worst case.

So perhaps we need another approach.

Let's think about the maximum possible even-length subarray in the run. For each possible even-length subarray, compute the XOR and see if it's less than 2^k. But this is O(m^2) time, which is not feasible for m up to 1e6.

So there must be a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible even-length subarray where the XOR is less than 2^k can be found by looking for the longest possible even-length subarray. But how?

Alternatively, for the XOR to be less than 2^k, all bits higher than or equal to k must be zero. But since in the XOR of the even-length subarray, the k-th bit is zero (because even number of elements), the XOR can have higher bits (like k+1, etc.) set, which would make it >= 2^k.

So the condition is that the XOR is less than 2^k. Which implies that all bits from k onwards are zero. So the highest bit in the XOR must be less than k.

So how can we model this?

Let's think for a given run (elements with bit k set) and for even-length subarrays. The XOR of the subarray must have all bits >=k as 0. So, the bits from k onwards in the XOR must be 0.

But how to check this.

Another approach: For each even-length subarray, the XOR's k-th bit is 0. But higher bits (k+1, etc.) could be 1 or 0. So to have XOR < 2^k, the XOR must have all higher bits (>=k) as 0. Which is equivalent to saying that the XOR is less than 2^k.

But how to efficiently find even-length subarrays where the XOR is less than 2^k.

Hmm. This seems challenging. Let's try to think of some properties.

The XOR of an even-length subarray in a run where all elements have bit k set. Let's denote that XOR as x.

We have x = P[j] ^ P[i-1], where j is even or odd depending on the parity of the subarray's starting index.

But since all elements in the run have bit k set, each x in the prefix XOR array has bit k set only if the number of elements up to that point is odd. Because each element contributes 1 to the k-th bit, so for even numbers of elements, the k-th bit is 0, and for odd, it's 1.

Wait, yes. The prefix XOR up to an even index (even number of elements) will have the k-th bit 0, and up to an odd index, it will have k-th bit 1.

But this is only considering the k-th bit. What about higher bits?

But the higher bits depend on the XOR of the elements' higher bits.

So for example, if the elements are 3 (11), 5 (101), then the prefix XOR for even indices (after two elements) is 3 ^5 = 6 (110), which has bit 2 set (k=1 for this example). So even though the elements have bit 1 set, their XOR can have higher bits set.

So, the XOR of a even-length subarray can have higher bits set, but the k-th bit is zero.

But to have x < 2^k, x must be less than 2^k, meaning that all bits higher than or equal to k are zero.

So the maximum possible x for which x < 2^k is (2^k -1). So the highest bit in x must be less than k.

But how can we track this in the prefix XOR array.

Let's think of it this way: for each j, we need to find the earliest index i in the prefix XOR array (of the same parity as j) such that P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k.

The XOR is P[j] ^ P[i], and we need this to be less than 2^k.

But how to find the maximum (j -i) for such pairs (i, j).

But with j and i being of the same parity (since even-length subarray requires j and i-1 to have opposite parity, but i-1 and j must have opposite parity. So j and i-1 must be different parity. So for j even, i-1 must be odd. For j odd, i-1 must be even. So the parity of i-1 is opposite to j's parity. So when j is even, i-1 is odd; when j is odd, i-1 is even.

Thus, for j even, we look at the odd indices in the prefix XOR array. For j odd, look at even indices.

So for each j, we can split the prefix XOR into even and odd groups, and look for the earliest occurrence in the opposite group where P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k.

But how to find this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to maintain for each parity (even and odd) a dictionary that maps the prefix XOR value to the earliest index where it occurs. Then, for each j, we can look up in the opposite parity's dictionary all possible P[i] values such that P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k, and find the earliest index i. Then, the length is j - i.

But even this is not straightforward, because for each j, we need to find the earliest i in the opposite parity's group where P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k. How can we compute that efficiently?

This seems like a problem where we need to precompute for each possible P[j], the earliest i in the opposite parity group such that P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k. But how?

But considering the constraints of time, perhaps there's a way to model this with a sliding window or similar technique.

Alternatively, for a given k, the maximum possible subarray length in a run is 2. So even if we can't find longer subarrays, we can check if there exists a pair of consecutive elements where their XOR is less than 2^k. So for each run, we can at least check the pairs and see if any of them satisfy the condition.

But that would only give us a maximum of 2. But in the third sample input, the maximum is 4. So there must be a way to find longer subarrays.

Another thought: the XOR of an even-length subarray may have a higher chance of being zero. For example, if the subarray is made up of pairs of elements that cancel each other out. So, for example, elements a, a, b, b would have XOR zero. But this is just a particular case.

But how to find such cases.

Alternatively, for the even-length subarrays, the XOR can be zero, which is certainly less than 2^k. So if there exists a subarray of even length with XOR zero, then that's a candidate.

The longest such subarray would be the maximum possible.

But how to find the longest even-length subarray with XOR zero.

To find the longest even-length subarray with XOR zero, we can track the prefix XOR and for each even index j, look for the earliest even index i where P[j] = P[i], and similarly for odd indices.

But this would give the longest such subarray with even length and XOR zero.

But this is a specific case. The problem requires XOR < 2^k, not necessarily zero.

But if we can find such a subarray with XOR zero, it's a valid candidate, but there may be longer subarrays with XOR not zero but still less than 2^k.

But this approach is only a partial solution.

So, the crux of the problem is to find for each run (elements with bit k set) the maximum even-length subarray with XOR < 2^k. How to do this efficiently.

Another approach is to note that for each run, the maximum possible even-length subarray is the entire run if its length is even and the XOR of the entire run is less than 2^k. Otherwise, we need to check shorter even-length subarrays.

But this would again require checking multiple possibilities.

Wait, but perhaps for a given run of m elements, the maximum even-length subarray is m if m is even and the total XOR is <2^k, or m-1 (even) if m is even but total XOR is >=2^k, etc. But this is not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, for a run of elements, the maximum possible even-length subarray with XOR <2^k could be up to the entire run if possible.

So perhaps for each run, we can compute the prefix XOR array and for each possible even length, check the XOR of the entire run. If it's less than 2^k, then the entire run is valid. Otherwise, check shorter lengths.

But even this approach could take O(m) time per run.

But given that for n=1e6, and with each run being processed per k, and with k up to 30, this could be O(3e7) operations, which may be manageable.

But this depends on how we process each run.

Alternatively, for each run, we can compute the prefix XOR array and then for each j in the run, look for the earliest i in the opposite parity group where P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let's consider that for a given j, the XOR P[j] ^ P[i] must be less than 2^k. Which is equivalent to P[j] ^ x < 2^k, where x is a prefix XOR from the opposite parity group.

We can rewrite this as x > P[j] ^ (2^k -1). Because XOR is tricky, but perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, since we need P[j] ^ x < 2^k, this is equivalent to x belongs to the set of numbers where x ^ P[j] < 2^k.

But how to find such x's in the prefix XOR array of the opposite parity group.

This seems like a problem that can be solved with a trie data structure, storing the binary representations of the prefix XOR values and allowing us to query for the minimum x such that x ^ current is less than 2^k.

But building a trie for each run would be time-consuming, especially for large runs.

Alternatively, for each run and each k, we can process the prefix XOR values and maintain a dictionary for each parity group, storing the earliest occurrence of each prefix XOR value. Then, for each j in the run, we can check all possible x in the opposite parity group's dictionary where x ^ P[j] < 2^k, and find the earliest x which gives the longest possible subarray (j - i).

But for large 2^k (e.g., up to 1e6), this is not feasible.

But wait, 2^k for k up to 20 is 1e6. So the threshold 2^k can be up to 1e6.

So for a given j, and given that x can be up to 1e6, how to efficiently find all x in the opposite parity group's dictionary such that x ^ P[j] < 2^k.

But even this is not straightforward.

Another thought: for x ^ P[j] < 2^k, the binary representation of x ^ P[j] must have all bits higher than or equal to k as 0, and the first k bits can be any combination that makes the value less than 2^k.

But since x and P[j] are known, we can model this.

For example, the first bit where x and P[j] differ is the highest bit where x ^ P[j] is 1. If that bit is less than k, then the condition is satisfied.

So the maximum possible value for x ^ P[j] is 2^k -1. So the highest bit of x ^ P[j] must be less than k.

So, the highest bit where x and P[j] differ is less than k. Or, x and P[j] have the same bits from k onwards. So for each x in the opposite parity group's prefix XOR values, we need to check if x and P[j] agree on all bits >=k. If they do, then x ^ P[j] will have all higher bits as 0, and the value will be less than 2^k.

So the problem reduces to, for each j, find the earliest x in the opposite parity group such that x and P[j] share the same bits from position k onwards.

If such x exists, then x ^ P[j] will be the XOR of the lower k bits, which is less than 2^k.

So how can we efficiently find such x's for each j?

This is similar to a bitmasking problem. For each j, we can create a mask that includes all bits >=k in P[j], and look for x's in the opposite parity group that share this mask.

For example, the mask is the value of P[j] with the lower k bits cleared. So mask = P[j] & (~((1 <<k) -1)).

Then, x must have the same mask. So x & mask == mask.

Because then, x and P[j] have the same bits in positions >=k, so their XOR will be zero in those positions, making the XOR less than 2^k.

So for each j, the mask is P[j] with the lower k bits zeroed. Then, we need to find x's in the opposite parity group with x & mask == mask. The earliest such x gives the maximum possible subarray length.

So, for each run and each k, we can precompute the mask for each j and look for x's with that mask in the opposite parity group.

But how to store these masks.

For each parity group (even and odd), we can maintain a dictionary that maps masks to the earliest index where that mask occurred.

Then, for each j, compute the mask (P[j] with lower k bits cleared), and look up in the opposite parity group's mask dictionary for the earliest occurrence of this mask. If found, the subarray from that index +1 to j has even length and XOR less than 2^k.

This seems promising.

So the steps would be:

For each run of elements with bit k set:

1. Compute the prefix XOR array P[0...m], where m is the length of the run.

2. Split the prefix XOR into even and odd indices. For even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

3. For each parity group (even and odd), maintain a dictionary that maps masks (P[i] & mask) to the earliest index i where this mask occurred. The mask is P[i] with the lower k bits cleared.

4. For each j in 0 to m:

   a. Compute the current prefix XOR value P[j].

   b. Determine the parity group of j (even or odd).

   c. The opposite parity group is the one we need to look into.

   d. Compute the mask for P[j] as (P[j] & (~((1 <<k) -1))).

   e. Check if this mask exists in the opposite parity group's mask dictionary. If it does, get the earliest index i where this mask occurred.

   f. The length of the subarray is j - i. We need to ensure that this is at least 2 (since j -i >=1, but the subarray is i+1 to j, which is j - (i+1) +1 = j -i. Which is >=1. But we need even length. Wait, j and i are indices in the prefix XOR array. The subarray from i+1 to j has length j - (i+1) +1 = j -i. Which must be even. Since j and i are of opposite parity (i is from the opposite group), j -i is odd. So j -i is odd. Then the length is j -i, which is odd. But we need even length. Wait, this suggests a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, no. Because j is even, and i is from the opposite parity (odd). So j -i is even minus odd = odd. So the length is j -i. Which is odd. Which is invalid. So this approach seems incorrect.

Ah, I see the confusion. Let's re-examine:

The parity of j (even or odd) in the prefix array depends on the parity of the number of elements considered. For example, j=0 is even (zero elements, even), j=1 is odd (one element), j=2 even (two elements), etc.

For a subarray from i+1 to j (elements x_{i+1} ... x_j), the length is j - (i+1) +1 = j -i. So j -i is the length.

The subarray's length must be even. So j -i must be even.

But j and i are indices in the prefix array. So j and i+1 have the following relationship:

i+1 to j is a subarray of length j - (i+1) +1 = j -i.

The parity of j is determined by the number of elements considered. So j is even if the number of elements is even (since prefix array starts at 0, which is even).

Wait, no. For example:

prefix array index 0: 0 elements.

index 1: 1 element.

index 2: 2 elements.

index 3: 3 elements.

So j is the index in the prefix array. The number of elements is j. So the parity of j is the parity of the number of elements. So for even j, the number of elements is even.

So when we look for even-length subarrays, the subarray's length is even. So the number of elements is even. So j -i must be even. Because j (number of elements) - i (number of elements) = j -i = even.

So for the subarray from i to j (prefix indices i and j), the number of elements is j -i. So to have even length, j -i must be even.

Which means j and i must have the same parity (even-even or odd-odd).

But earlier reasoning said that j and i must have opposite parity. So there's a contradiction.

This suggests that there's a mistake in earlier reasoning.

Let's re-express:

The subarray from i+1 to j has length j -i (number of elements). We need this length to be even. So j -i must be even.

This requires that j and i have the same parity. Because even minus even is even, odd minus odd is even.

So when j is even, i must be even. When j is odd, i must be odd.

So the earlier approach of looking for j and i in the same parity group is correct.

So to find even-length subarrays, for each j in even parity group, look for i in even parity group with i < j and j -i even (so same parity). Then, the subarray from i+1 to j has even length.

But how does this affect the mask approach?

Wait, this changes everything. So the previous approach of looking for opposite parity groups was incorrect. The correct approach is to look for the same parity groups.

So for each j, we need to look into the same parity group (even if j is even, odd if j is odd) to find i's such that j -i is even (so same parity), and P[j] ^ P[i] < 2^k.

So the mask approach would require that for each j, we look into the same parity group's mask dictionary.

So the correct steps are:

For each run of elements with bit k set:

1. Compute the prefix XOR array P[0...m], where m is the length of the run.

2. For each parity (even and odd), maintain a dictionary that maps masks (P[i] & mask) to the earliest index i, where mask is ~((1 <<k) -1). The mask is used to check that the higher bits (>=k) are the same as P[i] and P[j].

3. For each j in 0 to m:

   a. Compute current mask as P[j] & mask.

   b. Look up the same parity group's mask dictionary for this mask.

   c. If found, get the earliest index i where this mask occurred in the same parity group.

   d. The subarray from i+1 to j has length j -i, which is even (since j and i are of the same parity, j -i is even).

   e. The XOR of this subarray is P[j] ^ P[i], which has higher bits (>=k) zero (since mask is the same), so XOR is less than 2^k.

   f. Record the length j -i. The maximum such length is a candidate.

   g. Update the mask dictionary for the current parity group: if the current mask is not present or the current index j is earlier than the stored index, store j as the earliest occurrence.

But why do we need to update the mask dictionary? Because for the same parity group, we want to track the earliest occurrence of each mask, which allows us to find the longest possible subarray (j -i is maximized when i is as small as possible).

So for each j, we look into the same parity group's mask dictionary for the earliest i with the same mask. If found, the subarray from i+1 to j is even-length and the XOR is less than 2^k.

Thus, the maximum length among all such j's in the run is the answer for this k.

So this approach can be implemented efficiently.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

For each bit k from 30 down to 0:

   a. Iterate through the array and find runs of consecutive elements where each element has bit k set.

   b. For each such run:

      i. Compute the prefix XOR array.

      ii. For each prefix XOR in the run, compute the mask (P[j] & ~((1 <<k) -1)).

      iii. For each parity (even and odd), maintain a dictionary that maps mask values to the earliest index in that parity group.

      iv. For each j in 0 to len(run):

         - Compute the current parity (even or odd) based on j's parity.

         - Check if the current mask is in the same parity's dictionary.

         - If found, the length is j - earliest_index. If this is the maximum so far, update.

         - If the current mask is not in the dictionary or the current j is earlier than the stored index, update the dictionary.

   c. Record the maximum length found for this k.

Once all k's are processed, the overall maximum length is the answer.

But how to implement this efficiently.

But first, how to find the runs of elements with bit k set.

For each k, iterate through the array and collect contiguous segments of elements where each element has bit k set. This can be done in O(n) time per k. For k up to 30, this is O(30n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e6.

Once the runs are identified, for each run, process the prefix XOR array and compute the mask for each j.

Now, for each j in the run's prefix array (0-based), the parity is determined by j's value. For example, j=0 (even), j=1 (odd), etc.

The mask is P[j] with the lower k bits cleared, i.e., mask = P[j] & (~((1 <<k) -1)).

For each parity group (even and odd), we maintain a dictionary (like a hash map) that maps mask values to the earliest index where that mask was encountered with the same parity.

So, for each j:

   current_parity = j % 2

   current_mask = P[j] & (~((1 <<k) -1))

   if current_mask is in the same_parity_dict:

       earliest_i = same_parity_dict[current_mask]

       candidate_length = j - earliest_i

       if candidate_length >= max_length:

           max_length = candidate_length

   else:

       same_parity_dict[current_mask] = j

   // However, we need to store the earliest index for each mask and parity, so if the current_mask is not in the dict, add it with j as the index.

   // Also, if the current j is earlier than the stored index, update it.

Wait, no. Because we want the earliest occurrence of the mask. So for each mask and parity group, we store the earliest index where that mask was encountered. So when processing j in order (0 to m), for the same mask and parity, we only store the first occurrence (earliest index) to maximize the possible length.

So for example, when j=0, store mask and parity. Then, for j=2, if the mask is the same, the length is 2-0=2. If mask is encountered again later, j=4, the length is 4-0=4, which is better.

So for each mask and parity group, we store the first occurrence of the mask. So when processing j, if the mask is not in the same_parity_dict, we add it. If it is already present, we don't update it (since we want the earliest index).

Thus, the code for this part would be:

if current_mask not in same_parity_dict:

    same_parity_dict[current_mask] = j

Then, whenever we process j, we check if the current_mask is in the same_parity_dict. If yes, then the earliest_i is same_parity_dict[current_mask], and the candidate_length is j - earliest_i.

So for each j, we check if the mask exists in the same_parity_dict. If yes, compute the length. If not, add it to the dict.

But we need to initialize the same_parity_dict for each run. Because each run is processed independently for each k.

Now, the steps for processing a run for a given k:

Initialize same_parity_dict_even and same_parity_dict_odd.

For even parity (j even), use same_parity_dict_even.

For odd parity (j odd), use same_parity_dict_odd.

Wait, but the parity is determined by j's parity. For j=0 (even), parity is even, and we need to look into the same_parity_dict_even.

But for j=0, the prefix XOR is 0 (before any elements are processed). So for the first element of the run (j=0), the mask is 0 & mask (mask is ~((1 <<k) -1)). Which is zero. So the mask is zero. Then, if the same_parity_dict_even doesn't contain mask zero, it will be added with j=0.

Then, when processing j=2 (even parity), if mask is the same as j=0, then the candidate_length is 2-0=2.

So this is correct.

Now, the maximum candidate_length for the run is the maximum j - earliest_i found.

Once all runs for all k's are processed, the overall maximum candidate_length is the answer.

But also, the candidate_length must be >=2. Because the subarray must be of even length and >=2 elements.

Wait, no. For example, j=0 and i=0 gives candidate_length 0. But the subarray is from i+1 (0+1=1) to j=0, which is invalid. So we need to ensure that j > i.

So during processing, for each j, when we find a mask in the same_parity_dict, and j > i, then the length is j - i. Which must be >=1 (since j > i). But the subarray length is j -i elements. For this to be even, j -i must be even.

But j and i have the same parity (since same_parity_dict is for the same parity group), so j -i is even. So the length is even.

But the minimal even length is 2. So j -i must be >=2.

Wait, no. j -i can be 2, 4, etc. For example, j=2 and i=0: length 2. j=4 and i=0: length 4. So yes, the subarray length is j-i, which is even.

But how do we ensure that j -i >=2?

Because the earliest index i is as small as possible. So for j=0, i=0 would give length 0, which is invalid. But j must be processed in order from 0 to m. So when j=0, i=0 is the same index, so length 0. But j=0 has parity even. The same_parity_dict_even is initialized empty. So when j=0 is processed, mask is computed. If it's not in the dict, add it. Then, for j=2, if the mask is in the dict with i=0, then j-i=2, which is valid.

So the code will generate candidate_lengths of 2,4, etc., which are valid even lengths.

But what about when j=1 (odd parity). Then, i must be in the same_parity_dict_odd. But for j=1, the prefix is after 1 element, which is x_1. But the subarray from i+1 to j is of length j -i. For j=1 and i=1, length is 0. But if i is 1 (same parity), then j=1 and i=1 gives 0. So we need to ensure that j > i.

Thus, during processing, when j is processed, any i stored in the same_parity_dict must be <=j. So when j=0, i=0 is stored, but when j=2 comes, i=0 is considered, and j -i is 2, which is valid.

So the code correctly captures the maximum possible even-length subarrays where the XOR is less than 2^k.

Now, the code structure:

Read n and the array a.

Initialize the maximum_length to 0.

For each bit k from 30 down to 0:

   current_max = 0

   i = 0

   while i < n:

       if a[i] does not have bit k set:

           i +=1

           continue

       # find the end of the run

       j = i

       while j < n and (a[j] & (1 <<k)) !=0:

           j +=1

       run = a[i:j]

       # process this run for bit k

       m = len(run)

       prefix_xor = [0] * (m+1)

       for l in range(1, m+1):

           prefix_xor[l] = prefix_xor[l-1] ^ run[l-1]

       # initialize dictionaries for even and odd parity groups

       even_masks = {}

       odd_masks = {}

       current_run_max = 0

       for idx in range(m+1):

           # idx is the index in prefix_xor array (0-based)

           p = prefix_xor[idx]

           mask = p & (~((1 <<k) -1))

           parity = idx % 2

           if parity ==0:

               # even parity group

               if mask in even_masks:

                   # candidate length is idx - even_masks[mask]

                   candidate = idx - even_masks[mask]

                   if candidate > current_run_max:

                       current_run_max = candidate

               else:

                   even_masks[mask] = idx

           else:

               # odd parity group

               if mask in odd_masks:

                   candidate = idx - odd_masks[mask]

                   if candidate > current_run_max:

                       current_run_max = candidate

               else:

                   odd_masks[mask] = idx

       # update current_max

       if current_run_max > current_max:

           current_max = current_run_max

       i = j

   # update global maximum_length

   if current_max > maximum_length:

       maximum_length = current_max

# after processing all k's, output the maximum_length if >=2, else 0.

But wait, the current_run_max is the maximum j-i for the run. But j and i are indices in the prefix_xor array, so the actual subarray length is j-i, which is the number of elements in the subarray. For example, if the run has m elements, then the prefix_xor has m+1 elements (from 0 to m). So idx ranges from 0 to m.

For example, a run of length 4 (m=4) has prefix_xor of length 5 (0, x1, x1^x2, x1^x2^x3, x1^x2^x3^x4).

When idx is 4, then the parity is 4%2=0 (even). The prefix_xor is x1^x2^x3^x4. The mask is computed as this value with lower k bits cleared.

If even_masks contains this mask, then the candidate length is 4 - even_masks[mask], which would be the number of elements in the subarray. Because the subarray is from even_masks[mask]+1 to 4 (prefix_xor indices), which corresponds to elements in the run from even_masks[mask]+1 to 4 (since run is 0-based in the prefix_xor array).

So the candidate length is idx - even_masks[mask], which is the number of elements in the subarray. Which is even.

So for example, even_masks[mask] is 0, idx is 4: 4-0=4 elements. Which is valid (even length).

So current_run_max is the maximum even-length subarray for this run. If current_run_max is 4, then this is a valid candidate.

Now, after processing all runs for this k, current_max is the maximum for this k. We compare it with the global maximum_length and update if needed.

But what if current_run_max is 0? That would mean no valid subarrays for this run. So current_max would be 0 for this k.

Once all k's are processed, the maximum_length is the maximum even-length subarray found. But since the problem requires the subarray to be of length at least 2, if the maximum_length is 0, we output 0. Otherwise, we output the maximum_length.

But wait, current_run_max can be 2, 4, etc. For example, in the first sample input, the run is 2 elements. The prefix_xor array has indices 0,1,2. For idx=2 (even parity), the mask is computed. The even_masks would have stored the mask for idx=0. So candidate length is 2-0=2. Which is valid.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's test this logic with the third sample input.

Third sample input:

6

8 1 3 3 1 2

The valid subarray is from a2 to a5 (1-based), which is elements [1,3,3,1]. All have bit 0 set (the least significant bit). So k=0.

The mask for k=0 is P[j] & ~( (1<<0)-1 ) = P[j] & ~0x1 = P[j] & 0xfffffffe (assuming 32-bit numbers). Which clears the 0th bit.

But wait, for k=0, 1 <<0 is 1. So (1 <<k) -1 is 0. So the mask is P[j] & ~0 = P[j]. So mask is the entire P[j], but with the lower 0 bits cleared. Which is P[j] itself.

So for k=0, mask is the same as P[j].

So the code would check for even-length subarrays where P[j] and P[i] have the same mask (same P[j] and P[i] values).

Because for k=0, mask is P[j] & ~0x1. But ~0x1 is all bits except the 0th. So if P[j] has 0th bit cleared, mask is P[j]. If the 0th bit is set, mask is P[j] with 0th bit cleared.

But in the run of elements [1,3,3,1], which all have bit 0 set.

The prefix_xor array for this run is:

idx 0: 0 (even parity)
idx 1: 1 (odd parity)
idx 2: 1^3=2 (even parity)
idx 3: 2^3=1 (odd parity)
idx 4: 1^1=0 (even parity)
So mask for k=0 is P[j] & ~0x1.

For example, idx=4 (even parity):

prefix_xor is 0. mask is 0 & ~0x1 = 0.

Check even_masks for mask 0. even_masks is built as follows:

idx=0 (even parity):

mask = 0 & ~0x1 =0. even_masks[0] =0.

idx=2 (even parity):

prefix_xor is 2. mask=2 & ~0x1= 2 (since 2 is 10 in binary, 0th bit is 0). So mask is 2. even_masks doesn't have 2, so add it with idx=2.

idx=4 (even parity):

prefix_xor is 0. mask=0. even_masks has 0 with idx=0. candidate length is 4-0=4. current_run_max becomes 4.

So the code correctly captures this.

Thus, for k=0, current_run_max is 4. Which is the correct answer.

So this approach works.

Now, the code needs to handle all bits from 30 down to 0, and find the maximum possible even-length subarray for each bit, then take the maximum.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

For each bit k:

   O(n) time to find runs.

   For each run of length m:

       O(m) time to compute the prefix_xor.

       O(m) time to process each idx in the run's prefix_xor.

Thus, for each bit, the total time is O(n).

There are 31 bits (from 0 to 30), so total time is O(31n) = O(n), which is acceptable for n=1e6.

Space complexity:

For each run and bit, the prefix_xor array is O(m), and the even_masks and odd_masks dictionaries are O(m) in the worst case. But since runs are processed sequentially, and each run's processing is independent, the space per bit is O(m), which is manageable.

Thus, this approach should work.

Now, let's write the code.

But note that in Python, for large n (1e6), using lists for prefix_xor may be memory intensive. But since for each run, the prefix_xor is computed on the fly, and each run's processing is independent, this should be manageable.

But to save memory, we can compute the prefix_xor on the fly instead of storing it in a list.

Wait, in the current approach, the code for the run processing is:

run = a[i:j]

m = len(run)

prefix_xor = [0]*(m+1)

for l in range(1, m+1):

    prefix_xor[l] = prefix_xor[l-1] ^ run[l-1]

But for m up to 1e6, this is O(m) time and space. But for n=1e6, and 31 bits, this is O(31*1e6) space, which is acceptable.

But perhaps to optimize memory, we can compute the prefix_xor on the fly without storing the entire list.

Yes, because for each run, we can compute the prefix_xor as we go:

prev_xor = 0

for idx in range(len(run)):

    current_xor = prev_xor ^ run[idx]

    # compute prefix_xor[idx+1] as current_xor

    prev_xor = current_xor

But in the code, the prefix_xor is needed for each idx from 0 to m. But perhaps we can compute the prefix_xor incrementally and process each step.

But for the current code, perhaps it's easier to compute the prefix_xor array.

But for the sample input where n is 1e6 and each run is 1e6 elements, the prefix_xor array would require 1e6+1 integers. But in Python, this is manageable.

Thus, proceed with the code.

Now, the code:

Read n and array a.

Initialize maximum_length to 0.

For each k from 30 down to 0:

   current_max = 0

   i = 0

   while i < n:

       if (a[i] & (1 <<k)) ==0:

           i +=1

           continue

       # find the run

       j = i

       while j <n and (a[j] & (1 <<k)) !=0:

           j +=1

       run = a[i:j]

       m = len(run)

       # compute prefix_xor

       prefix_xor = [0]*(m+1)

       for l in range(1, m+1):

           prefix_xor[l] = prefix_xor[l-1] ^ run[l-1]

       # process the run

       even_masks = {}

       odd_masks = {}

       current_run_max = 0

       for idx in range(m+1):

           p = prefix_xor[idx]

           mask = p & (~((1 <<k) -1))

           parity = idx % 2

           if parity ==0:

               # even parity

               if mask in even_masks:

                   candidate = idx - even_masks[mask]

                   if candidate > current_run_max:

                       current_run_max = candidate

               else:

                   even_masks[mask] = idx

           else:

               # odd parity

               if mask in odd_masks:

                   candidate = idx - odd_masks[mask]

                   if candidate > current_run_max:

                       current_run_max = candidate

               else:

                   odd_masks[mask] = idx

       # update current_max for this run

       if current_run_max > current_max:

           current_max = current_run_max

       i = j

   # update global maximum_length

   if current_max > maximum_length:

       maximum_length = current_max

Finally, output maximum_length if it's at least 2, else 0.

But wait, in the code, current_run_max can be 0, 2,4, etc. For example, if a run has no even-length subarrays with XOR <2^k, current_run_max remains 0. But if the code finds a candidate_length of 2, which is valid.

But the problem requires the subarray to have length >=2. So maximum_length can be 0, 2, etc. But the code is tracking the maximum even-length subarrays found. So for example, if current_run_max is 4, then that's the maximum for this run.

The code will then select the maximum across all runs and all k's.

But in the code, current_max is initialized to 0 for each k. For each run, current_run_max is the maximum for that run. For example, a run that has a current_run_max of 4 would set current_max for this k to 4. After processing all runs for this k, if current_max is 4, the global maximum_length is updated to 4.

Finally, after processing all k's, if maximum_length is >=2, output it. Else, 0.

Thus, the code should output the correct answer.

Now, let's test the code with the first sample input:

Sample 1:

Input: 2

5 6

The array has elements 5 (101) and 6 (110). The AND of the entire array is 4, XOR is 3. So it's valid.

For k=2 (since 4 is 100, the highest bit set is 2), the run is the entire array.

Processing this run for k=2:

mask for each prefix_xor:

prefix_xor[0] =0. mask is 0 & ~ (2^2-1) = 0 & ~3 (assuming 32-bit) is 0 & 0xfffffffc = 0.

prefix_xor[1] =5. mask 5 & ~3 = 5 & 0xfffffffc = 4.

prefix_xor[2] =5^6=3. mask 3 & ~3 =0.

Processing idx=0 (even parity):

even_masks[0] =0.

idx=1 (odd parity):

mask 4 is not in odd_masks, so added.

idx=2 (even parity):

mask 0. even_masks has 0 at 0.

candidate is 2-0=2. current_run_max becomes 2.

Thus, current_max for k=2 is 2. Which is the maximum.

For other k's (like k=3, but 5 and 6 have no higher bits set), their runs are empty. So maximum_length becomes 2.

Thus, output is 2.

Sample 2:

Input:3

2 4 3

No good subarrays. The code will check all k's, but no run will have even-length subarrays with XOR < 2^k. So output 0.

Sample3:

As discussed, the code finds a subarray of length 4 for k=0.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's write the code.

But note that in Python, the bitwise operators are & and ^. Also, shifting is done with <<.

Handling large numbers (up to 1e6) is fine.

But for the mask computation, for k=0, (1 <<k) is 1, so (1 <<k) -1 is 0. mask is p & ~0, which is p.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, the code:

Read n, a.

max_length =0

for k in reversed(range(31)):

    current_max =0

    i=0

    n_ = len(a)

    while i <n_:

        if not (a[i] & (1 <<k)):

            i +=1

            continue

        j=i

        while j <n_ and (a[j] & (1 <<k)):

            j +=1

        run = a[i:j]

        m = len(run)

        prefix_xor = [0]*(m+1)

        for l in range(1, m+1):

            prefix_xor[l] = prefix_xor[l-1] ^ run[l-1]

        even_masks = dict()

        odd_masks = dict()

        current_run_max =0

        for idx in range(m+1):

            p = prefix_xor[idx]

            mask = p & (~((1 <<k) -1))  # mask is p with lower k bits cleared

            parity = idx %2

            if parity ==0:

                if mask in even_masks:

                    candidate = idx - even_masks[mask]

                    if candidate > current_run_max:

                        current_run_max = candidate

                else:

                    even_masks[mask] = idx

            else:

                if mask in odd_masks:

                    candidate = idx - odd_masks[mask]

                    if candidate > current_run_max:

                        current_run_max = candidate

                else:

                    odd_masks[mask] = idx

        if current_run_max > current_max:

            current_max = current_run_max

        i =j

    if current_max > max_length:

        max_length = current_max

print(max_length if max_length >=2 else 0)

But wait, the code has a problem. For example, the run may be processed, and the current_run_max could be 2, but if the maximum_length is already larger, it will not be updated.

But the code correctly tracks the maximum_length across all k's.

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

Sample3:

Input:

6

8 1 3 3 1 2

For k=0:

runs where elements have bit 0 set are elements 1 (0x1),3 (0x3),3,1. So indices 1 to 4.

run is [1,3,3,1].

prefix_xor:

0, 1, 1^3=2, 2^3=1, 1^1=0.

Processing each idx:

idx=0 (even):

mask is 0 & ~0 =0. even_masks[0]=0.

idx=1 (odd):

mask is1 & ~0 =1. added to odd_masks.

idx=2 (even):

mask is2 & ~0 =2. added to even_masks.

idx=3 (odd):

mask is1. added to odd_masks.

idx=4 (even):

mask is0. even_masks has 0 at 0. candidate is4-0=4. current_run_max=4.

Thus, for k=0, current_max=4.

Other k's may have runs, but the maximum is 4.

Thus, output is4.

Thus, the code works.

But the code has a potential issue for k=30, which could lead to mask computation with negative numbers if using signed integers. But in Python, integers are arbitrary-precision and unsigned shifts are not needed. The mask computation is correct as is.

Thus, this should be the correct code.
