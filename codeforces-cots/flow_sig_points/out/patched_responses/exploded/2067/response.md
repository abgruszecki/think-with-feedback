Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find the period of the sequence generated by the recurrence relation r_i = (a * r_{i-1} + b) mod m. Hmm, I remember that this is a linear congruential generator (LCG) problem. The challenge is to determine the cycle length once it starts repeating.

First, I need to understand how the sequence works. The sequence starts with r0, then each term is generated using the formula. The period is the smallest t such that after some k, all terms from r_k onwards repeat every t steps. So, the period is the length of the cycle once the sequence starts looping.

The problem is to find the minimal t. How do I approach this?

One idea is to track the values of r_i as they are generated and look for when a value repeats. Once a value repeats, the period can be determined by the distance between two occurrences. However, since the sequence could have a pre-period (like in the first example where the pre-period is 1 and the period is 2), we need to find the point where the cycle starts and then compute the length of the cycle.

But tracking all possible values could be memory-intensive if m is large (up to 1e5). But m is up to 1e5, which is manageable. So perhaps using a hash map (dictionary) to record the first occurrence of each r_i would work. Once a duplicate is found, the current index minus the first occurrence's index gives the possible period. But we have to be careful because the first occurrence might not be part of the cycle. Wait, no. Because once a value repeats, the sequence from that point onward will repeat the same steps as before. So the cycle starts at the first occurrence of that value, and the period is the current index minus the first occurrence's index.

Wait, that's the key. For example, if at step 3 we get a value that was seen at step 1, then the cycle length is 3-1=2. Because from step 1 onwards, the sequence repeats every 2 steps.

So the approach is:

1. Simulate the sequence step by step, keeping track of each r_i and the step when it was first seen.
2. Once a value is encountered again, compute the current step minus the step it was first seen. This is the period.
3. Return that period as the answer.

But how to handle cases where the entire sequence becomes constant? Like the third example, where after a point, all terms are 78. The period is 1, because each term is the same as the next. So the cycle length is 1.

So the algorithm is to iterate through each term, track the positions of each r_i. The moment a duplicate is found, return the difference between the current position and the first occurrence's position.

But this could be O(m) time and space, which is acceptable since m is up to 1e5. 1e5 elements in a dictionary is manageable in terms of memory.

So the steps are:

- Initialize a dictionary to map each r value to its index.
- Start with r = r0, and index 0.
- Then, for each next index i (starting from 1), compute r = (a * previous_r + b) mod m.
- Check if r is in the dictionary.
   - If yes, the period is i - dict[r]. Return this.
   - If no, add r to the dictionary with index i.
- Continue until a duplicate is found.

But wait, this approach will find the first occurrence of a duplicate. But the first occurrence may not be the start of the cycle. Wait, no. Because once a value repeats, the cycle is between the first occurrence and current index. Because the generator is deterministic. So once a value is repeated, all subsequent values will repeat the same steps as before. Therefore, the cycle starts at the first occurrence, and the length is current index - first occurrence index.

Yes. So the algorithm is correct.

Let's test this against the examples.

First example:

Input: 2 6 12 11.

Sequence is 11 (index 0), then 2*11+6=28 mod12=4 (index1), then 2*4+6=14 mod12=2 (index2), then 2*2+6=10 mod12=10 (index3), then 2*10+6=26 mod12=2 (index4), etc.

Looking at the indexes:

0:11
1:4
2:2
3:10
4:2 (duplicate found at index2). So the period is 4-2=2. Correct.

Second example:

Input: 2 3 5 1.

Sequence:

0:1
1: (2*1 +3) mod5 =5 mod5=0
2: (2*0 +3) mod5=3 mod5=3
3: (2*3+3) mod5=9 mod5=4
4: (2*4+3)=11 mod5=1
5: (2*1+3)=5 mod5=0. Wait, here, when we reach 0 again (index5), the first occurrence was index1. So period is 5-1=4. Which matches the example's output.

Third example:

3 6 81 9.

r0=9.

r1=3*9+6=33 mod81=33. index1.
r2=3*33 +6=105 mod81=24. index2.
r3=3*24 +6=78 mod81=78. index3.
r4=3*78 +6=240 mod81. 81*2=162, 240-162=78. 240 mod81 is 78. So r4=78. Now, this is a duplicate of index3. So period is 4-3=1. Correct.

So the algorithm works for these cases.

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum m is 1e5. So the loop can run up to m steps. Because once we have generated m+1 numbers, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. So the loop will terminate in at most m steps. Which for m=1e5 is acceptable. Each step is O(1) in a dictionary. So the time is O(m), which is acceptable for a 2-second time limit.

Now, the code.

We can use a dictionary (hash map) to track the indices of each r_i.

Initialize:

positions = {r0: 0}

current_r = r0

current_index = 0

Then, loop:

for each next step:

current_index +=1

current_r = (a * current_r + b) % m

if current_r is in positions:

   return current_index - positions[current_r]

else:

   positions[current_r] = current_index

Continue.

Yes. So the code can be written as:

Read a, b, m, r0.

If m is 0? No, constraints say 1 <= m <=1e5.

So code:

a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

positions = {}
current_r = r0
positions[current_r] = 0

for step in range(1, 10**5 *2):  # m can be up to 1e5, but in the worst case, after m steps, a collision must happen
    current_r = (a * current_r + b) % m
    if current_r in positions:
        print(step - positions[current_r])
        exit()
    else:
        positions[current_r] = step

Wait, but how many steps can there be? The maximum possible steps before a collision is m, since there are m possible remainders (0 to m-1). So for m steps, the loop can run up to m steps. So the loop can be written as:

for step in range(1, m+1):

But wait, in Python, the step would be 1, 2,..., m steps. For example, m=5. The loop runs from 1 to 5 (inclusive?), no. Because the range(1, m+1) is 1,2,...m steps. Because the loop runs m times.

But what's the maximum possible steps before a collision occurs? For example, if all possible m values are generated without collision until the m-th step. Then, the (m+1)th step must collide. So the loop can run up to m steps. So, the code can loop up to m steps, which is 1e5. So in the code, the loop can be for step in range(1, m+1):

But in the code, if after m steps (step from 1 to m), the maximum steps is m. For m=1e5, that's manageable.

But what if the loop runs m steps and no collision is found? That's impossible, because after m+1 steps, there must be a collision. So the loop will exit before that. So the code is correct.

So the code:

Read a, b, m, r0.

positions = {r0: 0}

current_r = r0.

Then, for step in 1 to m:

   compute next_r.

   check if next_r is in positions. If yes, return step - positions[next_r].

   else add to positions.

But in Python, after m steps, if no collision, then the loop ends, but according to the problem, there must be a collision. So the code will always find a collision within m steps.

Wait, the code for step runs from 1 to m (inclusive?), no. The range(1, m+1) generates steps 1,2,...,m. So the loop will run m times, generating up to the (m)th step.

But the initial r0 is at step 0. Then, after m steps, we have generated m+1 numbers. So by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Therefore, the code will always find the collision before m steps. So the loop can run up to m steps. So the code is correct.

Testing with the third example: after 3 steps (indexes 1,2,3,4?), let me see.

Third example: r0=9 (step 0). Then step1: 33 (index1), step2:24 (index2), step3:78 (index3), step4: (3*78 +6) = 240 mod81. 81*2=162, 240-162=78. So r4=78, which is in positions at step3. So in step4, current_r is 78. The code checks if 78 is in positions (which it is, at step3). So the code returns 4-3=1. Correct.

So the code works.

Now, handling the case when the entire sequence is a cycle from the start. For example, a=0, b=0, m=5, r0=0. The sequence is 0,0,0,... The period is 1. The code will check step1: r is 0. It's in positions (step0). So returns 1-0=1. Correct.

Another test case: a=1, b=1, m=3, r0=0. The sequence is 0,1,2,0,1,2,0... So after step1 (r=1), step2 (r=2), step3 (r=0). Now, in step3, r=0 is in positions (step0). So returns 3-0=3. But the actual period is 3. Correct.

So the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The code:

Read a, b, m, r0 from input.

Initialize a dictionary. Since m can be up to 1e5, using a list instead of a dict would be more efficient, but in Python, the list would need to be of size m, which is manageable. However, for m=1e5, a list of size m is 1e5 elements, which is acceptable. But using a dictionary (hash table) is easier here because we can check for the presence of a key in O(1) time.

So:

a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input().split())

positions = {}
current_r = r0
positions[current_r] = 0

step = 0

for step in range(1, m + 1):
    current_r = (a * current_r + b) % m
    if current_r in positions:
        print(step - positions[current_r])
        exit()
    positions[current_r] = step

Wait, but in the code, the loop is from 1 to m. But if m is 1e5, then in the worst case, the loop runs 1e5 steps, which is acceptable. But in the code, the step variable starts at 1. For each iteration, current_r is computed, then checked. For example, in the first example, the code would loop until step2. Then step is 2, current_r is 2, which is in positions (added at step2). Wait, wait the first example:

r0 is 11 (step0). Then step1: r=4. step2: r=2. step3: r=10. step4: r=2. At step4, the current_r is 2, which was added at step2. So step4 - step2 =2. So the loop in the code would run step from 1 to m. So in step4, the code would return 4-2=2.

But in the code, the loop is up to m steps. So for m=12, the code can run up to step12. But in the first example, the collision occurs at step4 (i.e., the fourth iteration of the loop?), wait, let's see.

Wait, the loop in the code is for step in 1 to m+1? No. The code uses range(1, m+1), which in Python is steps from 1 to m, inclusive. So for m=12, the loop runs 12 times, steps 1 through 12.

Wait, in the first example:

r0 is 11 (step0). Then the loop starts with step=1:

current_r = (2*11 +6) mod12 = 28 mod12=4. Check if 4 is in positions (no). Add 4 with step1.

step=2: compute (2*4+6)=14 mod12=2. Check if 2 is in positions (no). Add step2.

step=3: (2*2+6)=10 mod12=10. Add step3.

step=4: (2*10+6)=26 mod12=2. Now, 2 is in positions (step2). So step4 - step2 = 2. Return 2.

So the code returns correctly. So the code works.

Another case: when the sequence enters a cycle immediately. Like r0=0, a=0, b=0. Then r1=0. So step1, current_r=0 is in positions (step0). So return 1-0=1. Correct.

Now, code in Python:

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    a, b, m, r0 = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    seen = {}
    current = r0
    seen[current] = 0

    for step in range(1, m + 1):
        current = (a * current + b) % m
        if current in seen:
            print(step - seen[current], file=output_stream)
            return
        seen[current] = step



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3 6 81 9
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Yes.

So the code works for all the examples and edge cases. The code runs in O(m) time and space, which is acceptable for the constraints.
