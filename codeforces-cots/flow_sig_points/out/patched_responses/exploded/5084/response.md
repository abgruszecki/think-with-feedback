<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to parse it carefully.

So, the marbles are on a number line. We can choose to pin some of them. The cost of pinning is the sum of their ci values. For the marbles not pinned, they roll left to the next pinned marble. If there's no such pinned marble to the left, they roll infinitely, which is bad because we get an infinite penalty. So our goal is to select a subset of marbles to pin such that all unpinned marbles have a pinned marble to their left (so they can stop there), and the total cost (sum of c_i for pinned marbles plus sum of the path lengths) is minimized.

So first, we need to make sure that for every unpinned marble, there's a pinned marble to its left. Otherwise, the solution is invalid (infinite penalty). So the arrangement must be such that all marbles are either pinned or have a path to a pinned marble on the left.

Now, the key is to model this in a way that allows us to compute the minimal cost. Let's think about dynamic programming. Since the marbles are arranged on a number line, maybe we can process them in order from left to right.

Wait, but the marbles can be in any order. So first, we need to sort them by their x-coordinate. Because the problem is about left positions, the order of marbles from left to right is crucial. So step one: sort all marbles in increasing order of x.

Once sorted, marbles are in order x1 < x2 < ... < xn. Now, for each marble i, if we decide to pin it, then any marbles after i (to the right) that are not pinned can roll to i, but only if there's no other pinned marble between them and i. Wait, no: the unpinned marbles roll to the next pinned marble to the left. So, for example, if marbles are arranged as A (pinned), then B (unpinned), then C (pinned), then B would roll to A, not to C. Wait, no: the problem statement says "the marble rolls all the way up to the next marble which has a pin stuck in it and stops moving there." Wait, but the direction is left. So for an unpinned marble, it moves left until it finds the next pinned marble. Wait no, wait: the marbles are on a number line directed from left to right. So if an unpinned marble is to the right of a pinned one, does it roll left (towards lower x values) to the next pinned one? For example, if a marble is at position 5, and the next pinned marble to the left is at 3, then it rolls to 3. So the path length is 5-3=2. So for each unpinned marble, the path is (x_i - x_j), where x_j is the position of the first pinned marble to the left of x_i.

So the approach is to select a set of marbles to pin such that all marbles to the right of any pinned marble have a pinned marble in their left. That is, the rightmost pinned marble must be the last one (or after all unpinned marbles?), no. Wait, the marbles are sorted in increasing x. So suppose we have marbles ordered x1 < x2 < ... < xn. Let's say we choose to pin x3. Then marbles x4, x5, etc. can only be pinned, or if not pinned, they must have a pinned marble to their left. But if we pin x3 and x5, then x4 (unpinned) would have x3 as the next pinned to the left. But x5 is to the right of x4, so it's not considered. So, the arrangement of pinned marbles must form a sequence where each unpinned marble has a pinned one before it (to the left) in the sorted list.

So the structure of the solution is that the pinned marbles must be in a non-decreasing order of x (since they are sorted). So, for the marbles sorted in x order, when we select marbles to pin, they must be in such a way that between any two consecutive pinned marbles, there are marbles that are not pinned. But for each such non-pinned marble, their next pinned is the previous one in the pinned list.

So the problem reduces to selecting a subset of marbles (indices i_1, i_2, ..., i_k) in sorted order such that:

- All marbles not in the subset have their next pinned marble to the left. So, the subset must cover the marbles in a way that all marbles after the first pinned one (i_1) must either be pinned or have a pinned marble in their left. Wait, but if the first pinned is i_1 = 0 (assuming 0-based), then marbles before it (if any) would have no pinned marbles to the left, so those marbles must be pinned. Wait, but the marbles are sorted in increasing x. So the leftmost marble is x1, the next x2, etc. So the first pinned marble in the sorted list must be x1. Because if x1 is not pinned, then there's no pinned marble to its left (since it's the leftmost), so it would roll infinitely, which is invalid. Therefore, the first marble in the sorted list must be pinned. Otherwise, the solution is invalid. Therefore, the first marble in the sorted list must be pinned. So that's a critical observation. So x1 must be in the pinned set. Otherwise, the solution is invalid (infinite penalty). So in any valid solution, the first marble is pinned.

So that's a key point. So the first marble must be pinned. So that's a constraint we can enforce. Similarly, for other marbles, any unpinned marble must have a pinned marble to the left. So the pinned marbles must form a chain that covers all marbles. So the dynamic programming approach can model the problem by considering the marbles in order and tracking the last pinned marble.

So the dynamic programming state could be dp[i], representing the minimal cost when considering the first i marbles, with the i-th marble being the last pinned one. Then, for each j < i, we can consider that j was the last pinned before i. Then, when we choose to pin i, the cost would be dp[j] + c_i (cost of pinning i) plus the sum of the distances for marbles between j and i (they all roll to j's position, which is the last pinned before i). Wait, no. Wait, if j is the last pinned before i, then marbles j+1, j+2, ..., i-1 are not pinned and must roll to j's position. But wait, no. Wait, when i is pinned, the marbles between j and i (j+1 to i-1) can choose to be pinned or not. Wait, no. Because if we have marbles between j and i (sorted in order), then any marbles between j and i that are not pinned must have a pinned marble to their left. But j is the last pinned before i. So if we are considering i as the next pinned marble, then between j and i, all marbles must either be unpinned (and thus roll to j) or be pinned. But if they are pinned, then their position would split the group. So, perhaps the DP approach is to select a sequence of marbles where each subsequent marble is to the right, and between any two consecutive pinned marbles (say j and i), all marbles in j+1 to i-1 must not be pinned, and thus their cost is the sum of (x_k - x_j) for each k in j+1 to i-1. But if some of those marbles are pinned, then j and i would not be consecutive in the pinned list. Hmm, this seems complicated. But perhaps the DP approach can model the last pinned marble. So for each i (sorted in order), dp[i] is the minimal total cost when the i-th marble is the last pinned one. Then, for each j < i, we can compute the cost of j being the previous last pinned, and then adding the cost for the marbles between j and i (i is pinned, marbles between j and i are either pinned or not). Wait, but this seems like it's not considering all possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as selecting a set of marbles where each new marble is pinned, and the cost is the sum of c_i for the pinned marbles plus the sum of (x_k - x_j) for each k not pinned and j is the last pinned before k. So for the DP state, when we have selected up to j as the last pinned, and now adding i as the next pinned, the marbles between j and i are not pinned (since i is the next pinned). Wait, but marbles between j and i could have been pinned. So perhaps the optimal way is to decide for each i, the previous pinned marble j, and then the marbles between j and i are not pinned, so their cost is the sum of (x_k - x_j) for k from j+1 to i-1. Then, the cost of adding i is dp[j] + c_i + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} (x_k - x_j). But if there are marbles between j and i that are pinned, then j would not be the previous pinned marble. So this approach would not consider those possibilities. But perhaps this approach is correct, assuming that between j and i, all marbles are not pinned and thus their path lengths contribute to the sum. But then, this would imply that the marbles between j and i are not pinned. Wait, but if we pin some marbles between j and i, then those can't be part of this transition. So this suggests that the DP[j] represents the minimal cost when j is the last pinned marble up to that point, and when adding i as the next pinned, all marbles between j and i are not pinned. But that's not possible if there are other pinned marbles in between. So perhaps the DP approach requires that the last pinned marble is j, and the next is i. So between j and i, any marbles are not pinned and thus must contribute to the sum. Therefore, in this scenario, the only pinned marbles are j and i, and the marbles in between are not pinned. But that's only possible if there are no other pinned marbles between j and i. So the transitions in DP would consider adding i as the next pinned marble after j, and all marbles between j and i are not pinned. However, this would require that all marbles between j and i are not pinned, which might not be the case. Wait, but if there's another pinned marble between j and i, say k, then the DP state would have considered j -> k, then k -> i. So in that case, the marbles between j and k are not pinned, and the marbles between k and i are not pinned. So the DP approach, considering all possible j < i, and for each j, calculate the cost of adding i as the next pinned marble, with marbles between j and i not being pinned, would cover all possibilities. Because the marbles between j and i would have been handled by previous transitions. So the DP[i] = min over j < i of ( dp[j] + c_i + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} (x_i - x_j) ). Wait, no. Wait, the marbles between j and i, if not pinned, would have rolled to j. So their path length is (x_k - x_j). But if i is the next pinned marble, then marbles after i (like k > i) can roll to i if they are not pinned. But in the DP transition from j to i, we are only considering the marbles between j and i. So the sum of their path lengths (x_k - x_j) is added to the cost. Then, the cost for marbles after i would be considered in future transitions. So for each i, when it's the last pinned marble, the DP[i] is the minimal total cost up to i, considering all possible j's that could have been the previous pinned marble. So the idea is that, for each j < i, the marbles between j and i are not pinned, and thus their path lengths are added. The sum of their path lengths is (x_{j+1} - x_j) + (x_{j+2} - x_j) + ... + (x_{i-1} - x_j) = (sum of x's from j+1 to i-1) - (i - j - 1) * x_j. Then, when you choose to pin i, the cost is dp[j] (the minimal cost up to j) plus c_i (the cost of pinning i) plus this sum. So the DP recurrence would be: dp[i] = min_{j < i} ( dp[j] + c_i + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} (x_k - x_j) ) ). But how do we compute this sum efficiently? Let's precompute prefix sums. Let's define prefix_sum_x as an array where prefix_sum_x[i] is the sum of x_1 to x_i. Then, the sum from j+1 to i-1 of x_k is prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j]. The number of terms is (i-1) - (j+1) + 1 = i - j -1. So the sum of (x_k - x_j) is (prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j]) - x_j * (i - j -1). So that's the total path sum for marbles between j and i when they are not pinned. Therefore, the DP transition can be written as: dp[i] = min over j < i ( dp[j] + c_i + (prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j] - x_j*(i-j-1)) ). But since the marbles are sorted, j can be any from 0 to i-1. Wait, but the marbles are sorted in x order. Wait, perhaps the indices are 0-based. Let's say after sorting, marbles are 0-based. Then for i-th marble (after sorting), the previous j can be from 0 to i-1. But wait, the first marble (index 0) must be pinned, as otherwise the solution is invalid. So the initial condition is dp[0] = c_0. Then, for i from 1 to n-1, we compute dp[i] as the minimum of dp[j] + c_i + sum for k=j+1 to i-1 (x_k - x_j). Wait, but in this case, the first marble is pinned. Then, the marbles after can choose to be pinned or not. But according to the DP approach, any marbles between j and i are not pinned. Wait, but j is the last pinned before i, so marbles between j and i must not be pinned, otherwise j wouldn't be the last. So the DP approach is building a sequence of pinned marbles where each transition j → i implies that marbles between j and i are not pinned and thus their path lengths contribute to the cost. Then, after processing all marbles, the last pinned marble must be the rightmost one (n-1), because otherwise, marbles after the last pinned would have nowhere to roll. Wait, but the rightmost marble (n-1) may not be pinned. But according to the problem statement, if a marble is not pinned and there's no pinned marble to the left, it rolls infinitely. But since the marbles are sorted in increasing order, the rightmost marble (n-1) is the largest x. So if it's not pinned, there must be a pinned marble to its left (some j < n-1). But marbles after the last pinned would be to the right of it, but the last marble is the largest. So if the last pinned marble is j, then all marbles after j (i.e., j+1 to n-1) must be unpinned. But in that case, each of those marbles would have j as their next pinned marble. So in the DP approach, the minimal cost is the minimal dp[j] plus the sum of (x_k - x_j) for k from j+1 to n-1. So after processing all marbles, the total cost would be the minimal dp[j] plus the sum for k=j+1 to n-1 of (x_k - x_j). Wait, no. Because in the DP approach, dp[j] represents the cost up to j being the last pinned marble, and any marbles after j up to some i (when j is part of a transition) are considered. But for the marbles after the last pinned marble, they need to have their sum added. So the DP approach must account for all marbles. Therefore, the final answer would be the minimum of dp[j] + sum_{k=j+1 to n-1} (x_k - x_j), for all j from 0 to n-1. Because if j is the last pinned marble, then all marbles after j must be unpinned, and their path lengths are summed. So the DP approach must compute for each j the cost of j being the last pinned marble, and then add the sum of the marbles after j. Therefore, the steps are:

1. Sort the marbles by x in increasing order.
2. Precompute prefix sums of x to allow efficient calculation of the sum between j and i.
3. Initialize a DP array where dp[i] is the minimal cost when the i-th marble is the last pinned one.
4. For each i, compute dp[i] as the minimum over j < i of (dp[j] + c_i + sum between j and i-1 of (x_k - x_j)).
5. After filling the DP array, compute the final answer as the minimum of dp[j] + sum from j+1 to n-1 of (x_k - x_j) for all j.

But wait, when considering the marbles after the last pinned j, they are all unpinned and must roll to j. So the total cost is the sum of their (x_k - x_j) (since x_k >= x_j, as marbles are sorted). So the final answer is the minimum of (dp[j] + sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} (x_k - x_j)).

So the steps are:

- Sort marbles by x in increasing order.
- Compute prefix sums of x array.
- Compute prefix_sum_x[i] = x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_i.
- Then, for j and i, sum x from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j].
- The sum of (x_k - x_j) for k in j+1 to i-1 is (sum_x) - x_j * (number of terms), where number of terms is (i-1 - j) terms.

Now, the DP transitions can be computed efficiently with these precomputed values.

Now, the initial condition is that the first marble must be pinned. So dp[0] = c_0.

Then, for each i >=1, dp[i] is computed as the minimal value over all j < i of:

dp[j] + c_i + (prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j] - x_j * (i - j -1)).

Then, after computing all dp[i], the final answer is the minimal (dp[j] + (sum_{k=j+1 to n-1} (x_k - x_j))).

But how do we compute sum_{k=j+1 to n-1} (x_k - x_j) efficiently? Again, using the prefix sums. The sum x from j+1 to n-1 is (prefix_sum_x[n-1] - prefix_sum_x[j]). Then, subtract x_j multiplied by the number of terms, which is (n-1 - (j+1) + 1) = n - j -1.

So sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} (x_k - x_j) = (prefix_sum_x[n-1] - prefix_sum_x[j]) - x_j * (n-1 - j) = (total_sum - prefix_sum_x[j]) - x_j*(n-1-j).

Where total_sum is prefix_sum_x[n-1].

So the steps are:

1. Sort marbles by x.
2. Compute prefix_sum_x.
3. total_sum = prefix_sum_x[-1]
4. Compute dp array, then compute for each j, dp[j] + (total_sum - prefix_sum_x[j] - x_j*(n-1 -j)).

The minimal of these is the answer.

Now, the challenge is to compute this in O(n^2) time, since n can be up to 3000, which would be manageable (3000^2 is 9 million operations, which is acceptable for Python in 2 seconds).

So the plan is:

- Sort marbles by x.
- Compute prefix_sum_x.
- Initialize dp array. dp[0] = c_0 (since first marble must be pinned).
- For i from 1 to n-1:
   - Compute dp[i] = min over all j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + c_i + (prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j] - x_j * (i - j - 1)) )
   - So for each i, iterate through j from 0 to i-1, compute the value, and take the minimum.
- After filling dp, compute for each j, dp[j] + (total_sum - prefix_sum_x[j] - x_j * (n-1 - j)), and take the minimal of these as the answer.

Now, let's verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3
2 3
3 4
1 2

After sorting by x:

1 2 (x=1, c=2)
2 3 (x=2, c=3)
3 4 (x=3, c=4)

prefix_sum_x = [1, 3, 6]

n=3.

Compute dp:

dp[0] = c_0 = 2.

For i=1 (second marble, x=2, c=3):

j can be 0.

sum from j+1 to i-1 is j=0, i-1=0. So j+1=1, i-1=0. So no terms. Sum is 0. So the cost is dp[0] + c_i + 0 = 2 + 3 =5. So dp[1] =5.

For i=2 (third marble, x=3, c=4):

Check j=0 and j=1.

j=0:

sum from 1 to 1 (i-1=1) is x_1=3. sum x from 1 to 1 is 3. Subtract x_j*(i-j-1) where x_j=1, i-j-1=2-0-1=1. So sum =3 - 1*1 =2. So total is dp[0] +4 +2 =2+4+2=8.

j=1:

sum from 2 to 1 (i-1=1) is nothing. So sum is 0. So total is dp[1]+4+0=5+4=9. So minimum is 8. So dp[2]=8.

Then, compute for each j the final cost:

j=0:

sum from 1 to 2: x_1=2, x_2=3. Sum x is 5. prefix_sum_x[j] is 1. total_sum is 6. sum =6 -1 -1*(3-0-1) =6-1 -1*2=3. So the sum is 3. So total is dp[0] +3 =2+3=5.

j=1:

sum from 2 to 2: x_2=3. sum is 3. sum_x is 3. sum_x[j] is 3. total_sum - sum_x[j] =6-3=3. x_j=2. terms=3-1-1=1. So 3-2*1=1. So total is 5+1=6.

j=2:

sum from 3 to 2: nothing. sum is 0. So total is 8+0=8.

So the minimal is 5, which matches the sample output.

So the approach works for the first sample.

The second sample:

Input:

4
1 7
3 1
5 10
6 1

After sorting by x:

1 7 (x=1, c=7)
3 1 (x=3, c=1)
5 10 (x=5, c=10)
6 1 (x=6, c=1)

prefix_sum_x = [1,4,9,15]

n=4.

Compute dp:

dp[0] =7.

i=1 (x=3, c=1):

Check j=0.

sum from 1-0 to 0 (i=1, j=0: j+1 to i-1 is 1 to 0, no terms. sum=0. So cost is 7 +1 +0=8. So dp[1]=8.

i=2 (x=5, c=10):

Check j=0 and j=1.

j=0:

sum from 1 to 1 (marble 1, x=3). sum_x is 3. subtract x_j*(i-j-1) where x_j=1, (2-0-1)=1. So 3 -1*1=2. So cost is 7 +10 +2 =19.

j=1:

sum from 2 to 1: no terms. sum=0. So cost is 8 +10 +0=18. So dp[2] is 18.

i=3 (x=6, c=1):

Check j=0,1,2.

j=0:

sum from 1 to 2: marbles 1 and 2. x1=3, x2=5. sum is 3+5=8. subtract x_j*(3-0-1)=1*2=2. sum contribution 8-2=6. cost is 7 +1 +6=14.

j=1:

sum from 2 to 2 (marble 2). x=5. sum_x is 5. subtract x_j*(3-1-1)=3*(1) =3. sum contribution 5-3=2. cost is 8 +1 +2=11.

j=2:

sum from 3 to 2: no terms. sum=0. cost is 18 +1 +0=19. So dp[3] = min(14,11,19) → 11.

Then, for each j:

j=0: sum from 1 to 3.

sum x is 3+5+6=14. prefix_sum[j] is 1. total_sum is 15. sum_x[j+1..3] is 14. subtract x_j*(4-0-1) =1*3=3. sum contribution is 14-3=11. So total cost is 7 +11 =18.

j=1: sum from 2 to3 (x=5,6). sum is 11. subtract x_j=3*(4-1-1) =3*2=6. 11-6=5. So cost is 8 +5=13.

j=2: sum from3 to3:6. subtract x_j=5*(4-2-1) →5*(1) →5. 6-5=1. cost is 18+1=19.

j=3: sum from4 to3 → none. cost is 11+0=11.

So the minimal is 11, which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Now, the code steps:

Implement the following steps:

1. Read n.
2. Read n pairs of xi and ci.
3. Sort the marbles by xi.
4. Compute the prefix_sum_x array.
5. Compute the DP array.
6. Compute the minimal final answer.

Now, for the code:

Implement the sorting.

Then, prefix_sum = [x0, x0+x1, ...].

Then, the DP array is of size n, initialized with infinity except dp[0] = c0 (since first marble must be pinned).

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

   for each j in 0 to i-1:

       compute the cost of choosing j as previous.

       sum_terms = (prefix_sum[i-1] - prefix_sum[j]) - x[j] * (i - j -1)

       total = dp[j] + c[i] + sum_terms

       if this total is less than current dp[i], update dp[i]

Then, after filling the DP array, compute for each j in 0 to n-1:

   sum_terms = (prefix_sum[n-1] - prefix_sum[j]) - x[j] * (n-1 -j)

   total = dp[j] + sum_terms

   keep the minimal total.

Return the minimal total.

Now, handling large numbers (since x can be up to 1e9, but sums could be up to 3e3 * 1e9 = 3e12, which fits in Python's integers).

Now, code:

Read the marbles as list, sort them by x, compute prefix sums, compute DP, then compute the answer.

Sample code:

Read n.

Then read n lines, store as list of tuples (x, c).

Sort the list based on x.

Compute prefix_sum_x as a list, where prefix_sum_x[i] is sum of x_0 to x_i.

Compute total_sum = prefix_sum_x[-1]

Initialize dp array with infinity, except dp[0] = sorted_marbles[0][1]

Then loop for i from 1 to n-1:

   for each j in 0 to i-1:

       terms = prefix_sum_x[i-1] - prefix_sum_x[j]

       terms -= sorted_marbles[j][0] * (i - j -1)

       cost = dp[j] + sorted_marbles[i][1] + terms

       if cost < dp[i]:

           dp[i] = cost

Finally, compute for each j:

sum_terms = (total_sum - prefix_sum_x[j]) - sorted_marbles[j][0] * (n-1 -j)

current = dp[j] + sum_terms

min_answer = min of all current.

Output min_answer.

So, in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    marbles = []
    for _ in range(n):

    prefix_sum[0] = marbles[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):

Ah, in the manual analysis, when j=0 and i=2 (third marble), the marbles between j and i are 1 (marble 1), x=2. The sum of (x_k -x_j) is (2-1) =1. So sum_terms is 1. So code is correct. So why earlier manual calculation said 2? Because perhaps there was a mistake in the manual steps.

Wait, in the first sample's DP[i=2], j=0 gives:

sum_terms =1. So cost is 2 (dp[j=0]) +4 (c_i) +1 (sum_terms) =7. Then j=1 gives cost 5 +4 +0=9. So dp[i=2] is min(7,9) →7. Then, the final answer is the min over j=0,1,2 of (dp[j] + sum_terms_after_j).

For j=0: sum_terms_after_j is sum from 1 to 2. marbles 1 and 2 (x=2 and 3). sum_terms_after_j is (2+3) -1*(2) (since (n-1 -j) =2-0=2. 2 terms). So sum_terms_after_j is 5 -2 =3. So dp[j=0] +3 =2+3=5.

Which matches the sample. So the code would compute the correct value. But earlier manual calculation for DP[i=2] said dp[2] was 8. That was a mistake. So the code is correct. So this code works for the first sample.

But wait, the code's calculation for dp[2] in the first sample would be 7, but according to the sample, the answer is 5, which comes from j=0 in the final step. So what's wrong here?

Wait, no. Let's re-calculate the first sample with code:

Original marbles sorted as (1,2), (2,3), (3,4).

prefix_sum is [1,3,6].

For i=2 (third marble, x=3, c=4):

Loop j from 0 to 1.

j=0:

sum_terms = prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0] =3-1=2. Then subtract x_j=1 * (2-0-1) =1*(1) →1. sum_terms=2-1=1. So cost is dp[0] (2) +4 +1=7.

j=1:

sum_terms is prefix_sum[1-1] (since i-1=1, j=1: j+1=2 > i-1=1, so sum_terms=0. So cost is 5 (dp[1]) +4 +0=9. So dp[2] is 7.

Then, in the final step:

For j=0:

sum_terms_after = (6-1) -1*(2) →5-2=3. dp[0] +3=2+3=5.

For j=1:

sum_terms_after: (6-3) -3*(1) →3-3=0. dp[1] +0=5+0=5.

For j=2: sum_terms_after is (6-6) -3*0=0. dp[2] +0=7+0=7.

So the minimal is 5. Which comes from j=0 and j=1. But according to the code, the answer would be min(5,5,7) →5.

So the code would output 5. So why is the code's dp[2] 7? Because the code is considering the case where marble 2 is pinned, but the final answer doesn't require that. For example, the optimal solution is to pin marbles 0 and 2 (sum c=2+4=6, and the sum of path lengths is (2-1) (marble 1's path) and no others. But according to the sample output, the answer is 5. So in the sample's optimal solution, the marbles pinned are marbles 0 and 2, but why?

Wait, the sample input's marbles are sorted as 1,2,3. The correct solution is to pin marbles 0 (x=1, c=2) and 2 (x=3, c=4). Then:

marble 0 is pinned (cost 2).

marble 1 is not pinned, rolls to 0 (path length 2-1=1).

marble 2 is pinned (cost 4).

Total cost is 2+4 +1=7. But the sample output is 5. So this suggests there's a mistake.

Wait, the sample input's output is 5. Wait the input is:

3

2 3

3 4

1 2

So marbles are initially ordered as 2,3,1. After sorting, they are 1, 2,3 (x=1, c=2; x=2, c=3; x=3, c=4). So in the correct solution, the optimal is to pin marble 0 (x=1) and marble 2 (x=3). The sum of c is 2+4=6. The sum of path lengths is marble 1 rolls to 0: path length 2-1=1. So total cost is 6+1=7. But sample output is 5. So there's a mistake here. But according to the sample input, the output is 5. So what's the correct solution?

Ah, the sample input's output is 5, which suggests that the optimal is to pin marble 0 and 1 (x=1 and x=2). Then:

marble 0: cost 2.

marble 1: cost 3.

marble 2: not pinned. Rolls to marble 1 (x=2), path length 3-2=1.

Total cost: 2+3 +1 =6. But sample output is 5. Wait, no. Then why is the sample output 5?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The fine is the sum of the costs of the pinned marbles plus the sum of the path lengths of all marbles (pinned or not? No: the pinned marbles don't move. The unpinned marbles roll to the next pinned to the left.)

So in the case where marbles 0 and 2 are pinned:

marble 0: pinned (cost 2). Doesn't move.

marble 1: not pinned. Rolls to 0 (path 2-1=1). Adds 1.

marble 2: pinned (cost 4). Doesn't move.

Sum is 2+4 +1=7. But sample output is 5.

So this is not the correct solution.

The sample output is 5. So where is the error?

Wait, perhaps the sample solution pins marbles 0 and 2. But wait, in the sample input's output, the answer is 5. Let's see:

Wait, maybe the optimal solution is to pin marbles 0 (x=1, c=2) and 1 (x=2, c=3). Then:

marble 0: cost 2.

marble 1: cost 3.

marble 2: not pinned. Rolls to marble 1 (x=2 → path is 3-2=1).

Sum of c: 2+3=5. Sum of paths: 1. Total 6.

But sample output is 5.

Hmm. So this can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to pin marble 0 and 2, but one of their c's is negative. Wait, in the sample input, the marbles are:

marble 0: x=1, c=2.

marble 1: x=2, c=3.

marble 2: x=3, c=4.

So all c's are positive. So the sum of c's would be at least 2. But the sample output is 5. So this suggests that the solution is to pin only marble 0. But then marble 1 and 2 would have to roll to 0. So path lengths are (2-1) and (3-1) → sum 1+2=3. Sum c is 2. Total 5.

Yes! That's the case. So the optimal solution is to pin only the first marble (x=1, cost 2). Then, marbles 1 and 2 roll to it. Their path lengths are (2-1)+(3-1) =1+2=3. So total cost is 2+3=5.

Ah! So why does the code not consider this possibility?

Ah, because according to the code, the last pinned marble must be j, and marbles after j must be unpinned and roll to j. But in this scenario, j=0, and marbles after j (1 and 2) are unpinned, so their path lengths are summed. So the code's final calculation for j=0 is:

sum_terms_after_j = sum (x1 -x0) + (x2 -x0) → (2-1) + (3-1) =1 +2=3. So dp[0] +3 =2+3=5, which is the correct answer. So the code does consider this scenario.

But in the code's DP array, when j=0 is the last pinned marble, marbles after j (1 and 2) are unpinned. So the code's calculation is correct.

But in the code's DP array, the DP for i=2 (third marble) would have j=0 as one of the possible transitions. So why isn't this considered in the DP array?

Because the code's DP[i] represents the cost up to the i-th marble being the last pinned. So if the optimal solution is to have j=0 as the last pinned, then marbles 1 and 2 are not pinned. So the code's final step, which computes for each j, the cost of j being the last pinned, plus the sum of the marbles after j, would capture this.

So in the code's final calculation, when j=0, the sum_terms_after is 3. dp[j=0] is 2. So 2+3=5. Which is the correct answer.

So why is the code's DP array for i=2 7? Because the DP array represents the case where the last pinned is i=2. But the optimal solution is to have j=0 as the last pinned. So the code's final step is correct.

So the code works. The DP array is not the final answer, but the final answer is computed in the final step.

So the code correctly captures the scenario where the last pinned marble is j=0, and all marbles after are unpinned.

Thus, the code is correct.

So the code should work for all test cases.
