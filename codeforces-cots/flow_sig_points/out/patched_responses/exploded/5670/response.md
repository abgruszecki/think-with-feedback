<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the total number of "abc" subsequences across all possible replacements of the question marks in a given string. The constraints are tight, up to 200,000 characters, so I need an efficient approach. Let's think about how to model this.

First, let's understand the problem. For each question mark, there are 3 choices. The total number of possible strings is 3^k where k is the number of '?'. For each such string, we need to count the number of "abc" subsequences and sum all those counts. But directly generating all possibilities is impossible because k can be up to 200,000, leading to 3^200000 possibilities which is way too big.

So, we need a dynamic programming approach that tracks the possible contributions of each character (including question marks) to the formation of 'a's, 'ab's, and 'abc's, considering all possible replacements of '?'.

Let me think: For each position in the string, depending on the current character (a, b, c, or ?), we can compute how it contributes to the counts of a, ab, abc. Because each '?' can be replaced by a, b, or c, each with a certain probability or multiplicative factor.

Wait, but how do we model this? Let's see.

Let's track three variables:

- a_count: the total number of ways to form 'a's up to the current position.
- ab_count: the total number of ways to form 'ab's up to the current position.
- abc_count: the total number of ways to form 'abc's up to the current position.

But since each '?' can contribute different letters, each with a multiplicative factor based on the number of possible choices, we need to track these counts with weights that account for the possible options from the question marks.

Additionally, there's the factor of the number of possible ways the question marks can be replaced. Each '?' contributes a multiplier of 3 for each choice. But when processing a '?', the current character can be one of three options, each of which affects the a_count, ab_count, etc., differently.

Let me outline the approach:

We can model the problem with dynamic programming where each state represents the number of ways to form sequences up to a certain point, considering all possible substitutions of the '?'s. The multipliers will be based on the possibilities that each '?' can take, and how that affects the current counts.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initialize:

- a = 0 (number of a's considering all possible substitutions up to now)
- ab = 0 (number of ab's)
- abc = 0 (number of abc's)
- multiplier = 1 (this represents the number of ways we can replace the question marks processed so far)

For each character in the string:

Case 1: current character is 'a'

Then, for this character, every existing possible substitution (multiplier) can add a new 'a'. So the a count becomes a * 1 (since previous multiplier is already accounted for) plus the new possibilities. Wait, no:

Wait, when the current character is fixed as 'a', then each existing path (multiplier) will contribute a new 'a'. So the new a_count is a * 1 (since no new choices) plus the new a's added by this 'a'. Wait, maybe the formula is:

a = a * 1 + multiplier. Because this 'a' can start a new sequence of a's, and existing a's are from previous steps. The multiplier here is because if there were previous '?', each possible combination up to now is multiplied by 1 (since this character is fixed as 'a'). But wait, the multiplier is the number of possible ways to replace previous '?'. So when we process a non-'?', all the existing possibilities are multiplied by the current character's contribution.

Wait, let's re-express this. The multiplier represents the number of possible substitution combinations up to the current position. For example, if we have processed some '?', each substitution choice for those '?'s contributes to the multiplier. So, when processing a new character:

- If the current character is 'a', then for all possible substitutions up to this point (multiplier), this 'a' can add to the a_count. So, a_count = a_count * 1 (since this character is fixed as 'a') + multiplier (since each substitution path can now have this 'a' as a new a).

But wait, the existing a_count already accounts for all possible substitutions up to the previous steps. So when processing this 'a', each existing a_count is multiplied by 1 (since this character is fixed as 'a', no new options here), and the new a's added are the multiplier (since each of the substitution paths so far can take this 'a' as a new a).

Similarly, for 'b', it contributes to the ab_count. The number of new ab's is the current a_count (number of a's before this character) multiplied by 1 (since this is a 'b') and added to ab_count. But again, considering the multiplier.

Wait, perhaps I need to track a, ab, abc, and the multiplier. Let's think:

The variables a, ab, abc represent the total count of a's, ab's, abc's in all possible strings up to the current character. The multiplier represents the number of ways to replace the question marks up to this point. Wait, no. Because when a character is a '?', it can be replaced by a, b, or c. So each replacement choice would affect a, ab, abc in different ways. So, perhaps the variables a, ab, abc are calculated by considering all possibilities of replacing the current character (if it's a '?') with a, b, or c, each contributing their own part.

So, for each character, depending on what it is (a, b, c, or ?), we can calculate the new a, ab, abc.

For example, when the current character is 'a':

- The new a is previous a (since adding this 'a' doesn't affect existing a's) plus the number of ways to add a new a here, which is the current multiplier (since each substitution path up to now can have this 'a' as a new a). Because the current character is fixed as 'a', all substitution paths contribute to this.

So, new_a = a * 1 + multiplier.

Similarly, when the current character is 'b':

- It can contribute to the ab count. The number of new ab's is the previous a count (since each a before can pair with this b). So new_ab = ab * 1 + a * 1 (since each a before can form a new ab with this b). The multiplier here is 1, because the current character is fixed as b.

But wait, the multiplier is the number of substitution possibilities so far. So for a fixed character, the multiplier remains the same. However, if the current character is a '?', the multiplier increases by a factor of 3, because each substitution path now branches into three possibilities (a, b, c).

Wait, perhaps the variables a, ab, abc are computed as follows:

For each character in the string:

If the character is 'a':

- The new a is (current a) * 1 (since existing a's are carried forward) + multiplier (since each of the possible substitution paths can have this 'a' as a new a).
- The new ab remains ab * 1 (since this 'a' can't contribute to ab).
- The new abc remains abc * 1.
- The multiplier remains the same (since this character is fixed).

If the character is 'b':

- The new a is a (since adding a 'b' doesn't add to a).
- The new ab is ab * 1 + a * 1 (since each existing a can form an ab with this 'b').
- The new abc is abc * 1 (since adding a 'b' doesn't form abc).
- Multiplier remains same.

If the character is 'c':

- The new a is a.
- The new ab is ab.
- The new abc is abc + ab (since each existing ab can form abc with this 'c').
- Multiplier remains same.

If the character is '?':

Then, this '?' can be replaced by a, b, or c. So we need to account for all three possibilities. Each possibility contributes to a, ab, abc.

But how to model this? Let's think of the '?' as contributing to all three possibilities, but each with a weight of 1 (for a, b, c) multiplied by the current multiplier. But since each choice (a, b, c) is part of the substitution, the total multiplier after this step would be multiplied by 3 (since each substitution path up to now branches into three paths). So when the character is '?', the new multiplier is multiplier * 3.

But how to model the contributions from each of the three possible choices.

So for '?', we can model it as the sum of the contributions of each possible substitution. So:

The new a after processing '?' would be:

a_new = (a * 3) + multiplier * 1 (since for each of the three choices, we have to multiply the existing a by 3 (since each path branches into three), but when the choice is 'a', we add 1 * multiplier (the number of paths where this '?' is replaced by 'a').

Similarly, when the '?' is replaced by 'a', it contributes to a. When replaced by 'b', it contributes to ab (based on existing a's). When replaced by 'c', it contributes to abc (based on existing ab's).

Wait, perhaps for a '?', we need to compute the sum of the contributions from each possible replacement (a, b, c), and then combine them. Since each replacement is one of three options, and each contributes their own parts. Let's model each case:

When '?', the possible choices are a, b, c. Each choice contributes to the new a, ab, abc in different ways. The total for each variable (a, ab, abc) will be the sum of the contributions from each possible choice, multiplied by the weight of that choice (since each choice is part of the substitution possibilities).

But since each of the three choices are equally possible, the contributions are additive. Let's break it down:

For the '?', the new a is:

sum over the three possibilities:

- if replaced by 'a': adds multiplier to a.
- if replaced by 'b' or 'c': does not add to a.

So, the contribution to a is 1/3 * (a_prev * 3) + (1 * multiplier) for the 'a' case. Wait, no. Wait, when processing a '?', each of the three options is possible. So for each of the three options, the variables a, ab, abc are updated as if that character was chosen, and then multiplied by the number of possibilities. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute for each variable (a, ab, abc) the sum of the possibilities when the '?' is replaced by a, b, or c, each multiplied by 1 (since each choice is a separate path), and the overall multiplier increases by a factor of 3.

Alternatively, since each '?' has three options, the total contribution for the current character is the sum of the three possibilities, each multiplied by the current multiplier. But how?

Alternatively, for a '?', the contributions to a, ab, abc are as follows:

The new a is (a * 3) + (multiplier) * 1 (since replacing with 'a' adds multiplier a's, but replacing with 'b' or 'c' adds 0 to a. But the existing a's are multiplied by 3, because each existing path now splits into three paths (each of the three options). Wait, no. Wait, the existing a's are from before this character. For each of those paths, when the current character is a '?', there are three possibilities. So existing a's (a_prev) would be carried forward multiplied by 3 (since each path splits into three). But in addition, if the '?' is replaced by 'a', then each of the previous paths (multiplier) would add a new a. So the new a would be:

a_new = a_prev * 3 (since each of the three options could have been chosen, but the existing a_prev is part of all three choices) + (number of times 'a' is chosen) * multiplier.

But how many times is 'a' chosen? For each of the previous paths (multiplier paths), replacing the '?' with 'a' is one possibility. So the number of new a's added from choosing 'a' is multiplier * 1 (since each path contributes one 'a' for the 'a' choice). The other two choices (b and c) don't add to a.

So for 'a' choice: a_prev * 3 (all existing a's are multiplied by three options) plus multiplier (from 'a' choice).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of each possible substitution path. For each substitution path up to the previous character (there are m = multiplier paths), when processing a '?', each path branches into three new paths (for a, b, c). So the total number of paths becomes m * 3.

Now, for each of these three choices, the a, ab, abc counts are updated accordingly.

So for each choice (a, b, c) of the '?', we have:

Case 1: choice is 'a'

In this case:

new_a = previous_a + 1 (per substitution path where this choice is made)
But since there are m paths before, each of these paths branches into one path here (for 'a'), so the total new a added is m * 1.

But existing a's (from previous steps) would carry over, but multiplied by 3 (since each path is split into three). Wait, no. For the existing a's, when the current character is a '?', each path that had a certain a count now has three possibilities. So, the existing a count (a_prev) is multiplied by 3 (since each path contributes to all three choices). But for the new a's added by the 'a' choice, it's m * 1 (since in those paths where the '?' is replaced by 'a', each contributes a new a).

So the new a after processing a '?' is:

a_new = a_prev * 3 (existing a's are in all three choices) + m (the new a's from 'a' choice).

Similarly, for the 'b' choice:

The new ab is ab_prev * 3 (existing ab's in all three choices) + a_prev (the number of a's in the paths where the '?' is replaced by 'b').

Wait, for the 'b' choice, each path where the '?' is replaced by 'b' contributes to ab. The number of new ab's in those paths is the previous a_prev (number of a's before this step) multiplied by 1 (since each 'b' in this position pairs with those a's).

So for the 'b' choice, the contribution to ab is a_prev * m (but wait, no, because each of the m paths would have a_prev a's, and for the 'b' choice, each such path contributes a_prev a's to form new ab's. So the total is a_prev * m (since for each of the m paths, the 'b' choice adds a_prev new ab's).

But how does this fit into the ab calculation?

Similarly, when the '?' is replaced by 'c', the contribution to abc is ab_prev * m (since each of the m paths that choose 'c' here adds ab_prev new abc's).

But since the '?' can be any of the three, the overall contributions are the sum of all three possibilities.

So, for the '?', the new a, ab, abc would be:

a_new = (a_prev * 3) + (m * (choice is 'a' ? 1 : 0) summed over all three choices).

But the three choices contribute 'a' once, so the sum is 1 (for the 'a' choice) multiplied by m.

Thus, a_new = a_prev * 3 + m.

Similarly, for ab_new:

ab_new = ab_prev * 3 (since all three choices carry over existing ab's) + (a_prev * 1) (from the 'b' choice) * m (since each 'b' choice in m paths contributes a_prev new ab's) + (from the 'a' or 'c' choice, 0).

Wait, no. For the 'b' choice, each path that chooses 'b' will have a_prev a's (from before this step) that can form ab with this 'b'. So the number of new ab's from 'b' is a_prev * number of paths that chose 'b'. The number of such paths is m (since each previous path branches into three, so m paths choose 'b' here, leading to m new paths for each 'b' choice). So the contribution from 'b' choice to ab is a_prev * m.

For the other choices ('a' and 'c'), the 'a' choice may contribute to a_new, but not to ab in this step, and 'c' choice contributes to abc if there are existing ab's.

So, for the '?', the ab_new is:

ab_prev * 3 (existing ab's multiplied by three choices) + a_prev * m (from 'b' choice) + 0 (from 'a' choice) + 0 (from 'c' choice).

Similarly, abc_new:

abc_prev * 3 (from all three choices) + ab_prev * m (from 'c' choice, since in those paths where 'c' is chosen, existing ab's contribute to abc) + 0 from other choices.

So, putting it all together:

When processing a '?', the variables are updated as follows:

a_new = a_prev * 3 + m * (1 if choice is 'a' else 0 for each of three choices)

But since there are three choices, the sum is 1 (for the 'a' choice) + 0 (others) = 1, multiplied by m.

So:

a_new = a_prev * 3 + m * 1

ab_new = ab_prev * 3 + a_prev * m (from 'b' choice)

abc_new = abc_prev * 3 + ab_prev * m (from 'c' choice)

Additionally, the multiplier after processing the '?' becomes m * 3.

So, for a '?', the updates are:

a, ab, abc = (a * 3 + m) % MOD, (ab * 3 + a_prev * m) % MOD, (abc * 3 + ab_prev * m) % MOD

m = (m * 3) % MOD

Wait, but wait: when we process a '?', the new multiplier is m * 3, because each of the previous m paths splits into three (for each choice of a, b, c). So, the multiplier becomes m * 3.

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize a = 0, ab = 0, abc = 0, multiplier = 1.

For each char in s:

    if char == 'a':
        new_a = (a + multiplier) % MOD
        new_ab = ab
        new_abc = abc
        multiplier remains the same.
    elif char == 'b':
        new_a = a
        new_ab = (ab + a) % MOD
        new_abc = abc
        multiplier remains the same.
    elif char == 'c':
        new_a = a
        new_ab = ab
        new_abc = (abc + ab) % MOD
        multiplier remains the same.
    else: # '?'
        # For each possible choice, sum the contributions
        new_a = (a * 3 + multiplier) % MOD
        new_ab = (ab * 3 + a) % MOD  # because 'b' adds a * multiplier
        new_abc = (abc * 3 + ab) % MOD  # 'c' adds ab * multiplier
        multiplier = (multiplier * 3) % MOD

    # Update the variables
    a, ab, abc = new_a, new_ab, new_abc

Wait, but for the '?', when calculating new_ab, why is it ab *3 + a (without multiplying a by the multiplier)? Because in the 'b' case, the contribution is a_prev (a before processing this step) multiplied by the multiplier (m), because each path that chooses 'b' contributes a_prev to ab. But in the code above, when we have a '?', the code for new_ab is ab *3 (from the existing ab's multiplied by 3 choices) plus a (from the 'b' choice). But shouldn't that a be a_prev * m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's re-express.

In the case of a '?', the three possible replacements are a, b, c. Each contributes to a, ab, abc as follows:

For a:

- a increases by m (since each path before branches into a, and the a contributes 1 new a per path)
- ab remains ab * 3 (because existing ab's are multiplied by 3 for the three choices)
- abc remains abc * 3

For b:

- a remains a * 3 (but no new a)
- ab increases by a * m (since each path that chooses 'b' adds a new ab for each a before)
- abc remains abc * 3

For c:

- a remains a * 3
- ab remains ab *3
- abc increases by ab * m (each path choosing 'c' adds ab new abc)

So, the total contributions for a '?' would be:

new_a = (a * 3) (from all three choices) + m (from a choice)

new_ab = (ab * 3) (from all three choices) + a * m (from b choice)

new_abc = (abc *3) (from all three choices) + ab * m (from c choice)

Yes, that's correct. Because for each choice:

- a is multiplied by 3 (since each of the three choices is considered)
- plus for the a choice, add m (since in each of the m paths, the a choice adds a new a)
- For the b choice, the contribution to ab is a_prev (the a before this step) multiplied by m (since each path can choose 'b', which is m paths)
- For the c choice, the contribution to abc is ab_prev * m.

So, the code for '?' is:

new_a = (a * 3) + multiplier
new_ab = (ab * 3) + a * multiplier
new_abc = (abc * 3) + ab * multiplier
multiplier *= 3

So, that's the correct way to model it. Then, after processing each character, the variables a, ab, abc are updated to new_a, new_ab, new_abc, and multiplier is updated if the current character is a '?'.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

First example input:

6
ac?b?c

Processing each character:

Initialize a=0, ab=0, abc=0, multiplier=1.

First character 'a':

new_a = 0 + 1 = 1
ab remains 0
abc remains 0
multiplier remains 1.

a=1, ab=0, abc=0.

Second character 'c':

It's a 'c'. So:

new_a = 1 (a remains)
new_ab = 0 (ab remains)
new_abc = 0 + 0 (ab is 0) = 0.
multiplier remains 1.

So after this step, abc is 0.

Third character '?': 

We need to compute new_a, new_ab, new_abc.

current a is 1, ab is 0, abc is 0, multiplier is 1.

new_a = 1 * 3 + 1 * 1 = 3 +1 =4

new_ab = 0 *3 + 1 *1 = 0 +1=1

new_abc =0 *3 + 0 *1=0.

multiplier becomes 1 *3=3.

Now a=4, ab=1, abc=0, multiplier=3.

Fourth character 'b':

It's 'b'. So:

new_a =4 (remains)
new_ab =1 +4=5
new_abc=0 (abc remains)
multiplier remains 3.

Now a=4, ab=5, abc=0.

Fifth character '?':

current a=4, ab=5, abc=0, multiplier=3.

new_a =4 *3 +3 =12 +3=15.

new_ab=5*3 +4*3=15 +12=27.

new_abc=0 *3 +5 *3=0 +15=15.

multiplier becomes 3*3=9.

Now a=15, ab=27, abc=15.

Sixth character 'c':

It's 'c'. So:

new_a=15.

new_ab=27.

new_abc=15 +27=42.

multiplier remains 9.

So after processing all characters, abc is 42. Then the answer is 42. But according to the first example, the output is 24. Wait, this doesn't match. So where is the mistake?

Wait, the first example's input is "ac?b?c". Let's process it step by step again.

Let me re-calculate:

Processing each character:

Initial state: a=0, ab=0, abc=0, multiplier=1.

First character is 'a':

new_a = 0 +1 =1.

others remain 0.

state: a=1, ab=0, abc=0, m=1.

Second character 'c':

so, new_a remains 1.

new_ab remains 0.

new_abc = 0 + ab (0) → 0.

so abc is 0.

state: a=1, ab=0, abc=0, m=1.

Third character '?':

new_a = 1 *3 +1 =4.

new_ab =0 *3 +1 *1=1.

new_abc=0*3 +0 *1=0.

m=3.

state after '?': a=4, ab=1, abc=0, m=3.

Fourth character 'b':

Processing 'b':

new_ab = ab_prev + a_prev =1 +4=5.

So state becomes a=4, ab=5, abc=0, m=3.

Fifth character '?':

Processing '?'.

new_a =4 *3 +3 =15.

new_ab =5 *3 +4 *3 =15 +12=27.

new_abc=0 *3 +5 *3=15.

m becomes 9.

state: a=15, ab=27, abc=15, m=9.

Sixth character 'c':

Processing 'c':

new_abc =15 +27=42.

So final abc is 42.

But the first example's output is 24. So this indicates that there's a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, that's a problem. So according to this calculation, the answer is 42, but the correct answer is 24. So the approach is wrong.

What's wrong here?

Wait, in the first example, the code produces 42, but the correct answer is 24. So there's a flaw in the model.

Let's think again. Maybe the model is not considering that the multiplier represents the number of substitution paths up to the current point. For example, when a '?' is processed, the multiplier increases by a factor of 3, which is correct. However, the contributions from each of the three possible choices may not be properly accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way we model the '?'. Let's re-examine the '?' case.

The '?' can be replaced by a, b, or c. For each of these three possibilities, the current a, ab, abc variables are updated as if that character was present, and all three possibilities are summed together. However, the way we model the variables for '?' is that a, ab, abc are the sum of the three possibilities.

But in reality, each of the three possibilities contributes to the variables, and the multiplier (the number of paths) is multiplied by 3. So, the model should account for each of the three possibilities, each contributing to the variables, and then sum those contributions.

But perhaps the way we handle the variables for '?' is not correctly considering that the existing a, ab, abc are multiplied by 3 (because each existing path splits into three new paths for each choice).

Wait, for example, when a '?' is processed:

The existing a_prev is the number of a's in all paths up to that point. Each path will split into three new paths (a, b, c). So, for each of the three choices, the a_prev is carried forward (since existing a's are present in all three choices). For example, if a_prev is 2, then after processing the '?', each of the three choices will have 2 a's from before, but in addition, the 'a' choice adds 1 per path.

So, in the 'a' choice: a_prev *1 (carried over) +1 (new a).

In the 'b' choice: a_prev *1 (carried over) +0.

In the 'c' choice: a_prev *1 (carried over) +0.

So, the total a after processing '?' is (a_prev *1 *3) (sum over all three choices) + (1 for 'a' choice multiplied by the number of paths before '?', which is m).

Thus, new_a = a_prev *3 + m.

This is correct.

But how about ab?

In the 'a' choice: ab_prev is carried over (since adding 'a' doesn't contribute to ab).

In the 'b' choice: ab_prev is carried over (existing ab's) plus new ab's from a_prev (number of a's before) *1 (since this 'b' is added to each a in the paths).

In the 'c' choice: ab_prev is carried over.

So, for ab:

sum over all three choices:

- 'a' choice: ab_prev *1.
- 'b' choice: ab_prev *1 + a_prev *1.
- 'c' choice: ab_prev *1.

Total ab_new = ab_prev *3 (from all three choices) + a_prev *1 (from 'b' choice) * m (number of paths before '?')? Wait, no. Because for the 'b' choice, each path that chooses 'b' contributes a_prev new ab's. The number of paths that choose 'b' is m (since for each previous path, there's one 'b' choice). So, the total contribution from 'b' choice is a_prev * m.

Thus, ab_new = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * m.

Which is what was coded.

Similarly, for abc:

sum over all three choices:

- 'a' choice: abc_prev.
- 'b' choice: abc_prev.
- 'c' choice: abc_prev + ab_prev (from the 'c' choice, which adds ab_prev new abc's).

So, total abc_new is abc_prev *3 (from the three choices) + ab_prev * m (from 'c' choice).

So the code for '?' seems correct.

But in the first example, according to this code, the answer is 42, but the correct answer is 24. So there's a mistake in the model.

Let's re-examine the first example.

The input is "ac?b?c", which is 6 characters. Let's list all possible substitutions. The two '?'s are in positions 3 and 5.

The first '? can be a, b, c. The second can be a, b, c. So 3 *3 =9 possible strings.

The code's approach is to compute the total number of abc subsequences across all 9 possibilities. According to the example, this sum is 24.

But according to the code's calculation, the final abc is 42. So why the discrepancy?

Hmm. Let's trace the code step by step again for the first example.

Original steps:

Initial state: a=0, ab=0, abc=0, m=1.

Processing first character 'a':

a becomes 0 +1 =1. m remains 1.

Processing second character 'c':

abc becomes 0 + ab (0) → 0. So abc remains 0.

Processing third character '?' (first ?):

new_a = a_prev *3 + m → 1*3 +1=4.

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *m → 0*3 +1*1=1.

new_abc = abc_prev *3 + ab_prev *m → 0*3 +0*1=0.

m becomes 3.

Now, after first '?', a=4, ab=1, abc=0, m=3.

Fourth character is 'b':

new_ab = ab_prev + a_prev →1 +4=5.

So ab becomes5.

Processing fifth character '?' (second ?):

new_a =4*3 +3 =15.

new_ab =5*3 +4 *3 →15 +12=27.

new_abc =0*3 +5*3 →15.

m becomes3 *3=9.

So after this step, abc=15.

Sixth character is 'c':

new_abc =15 +27 =42.

So the final abc is42. But the correct answer is24. So this suggests that the model is wrong.

Wait, but why is this happening?

Let's think about each possible substitution.

In the first example, the string after substitution is "acXYZbYc", where X and Y are the two ?s. Each can be a, b, c.

For example, in the sample explanation, one of the strings is "acabac". Let's count the number of abc subsequences in this string.

The string is a c a b a c.

Looking for a's followed by b's followed by c's.

Possible a's are at positions 0, 2, 4.

Possible b's are at position3.

Possible c's are at positions 1,5.

So the possible abc subsequences are:

a0, b3, c5.

a2, b3, c5.

a4, b3, c5.

But wait, how many are there? The sample explanation says "acabac" has 2. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the sample explanation lists the first example's possible strings. For "acabac", the two subsequences are (0,3,5) and (2,3,5). Because the a's are at 0, 2,4; the b is at3; the c is at5.

So a0 + b3 + c5 → yes.

a2 + b3 + c5 → yes.

a4 + b3 + c5 → yes? But the sample says 2. So what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sample's explanation. Let me check the sample input again.

Sample input:

6
ac?b?c

The possible strings are generated by replacing the two ?s. The first ? is at position 2 (0-based?), and the second at position4.

Original string is indexes 0:a, 1:c, 2:?, 3:b, 4:?,5:c.

Replacing first ? (index 2) with a, b, or c, and the second ? (index4) with a, b, or c.

The sample says the first example's output is24, and the list of strings includes "acabac" (which would have two 'a's in positions 0 and 2, and another 'a' in position4. The 'b' is at3, and the 'c's at1 and5.

So in "acabac", the 'a's are at 0, 2,4; 'b' at3; 'c's at1,5.

So the possible abc subsequences would be:

For each a before the b (positions0,2,4), and a c after the b (position5).

So for a0, b3, c5 → valid.

a2, b3, c5 → valid.

a4, b3, c5 → valid.

Wait, that's three, but the sample says the first string has 2. So why?

Ah, maybe I'm miscounting. The string is "a c a b a c".

Wait, the 'c's are at positions1 and5. So for abc subsequence, the c has to come after the b. So the c can only be at position5.

So the b is at3, and the c is at5. So for each a before the b (positions0,2,4?), but wait, the a at position4 is after the b at3. So that a can't be part of a subsequence.

Ah, right. Because the b is at3, any a after that can't be used. So the a's are at positions0,2. So in the string "acabac", the a's are positions0,2 (before the b) and the a at4 is after the b. So it can't be used.

So in "acabac", the abc subsequences are (0,3,5) and (2,3,5) → total of 2. But according to the code's calculation, this string's contribution is 2. However, according to the code's model, the final abc count is42. So why?

In the code's model, after processing all characters, abc is42. So the code's approach would be summing all abc's across all substitution possibilities, which would be 42. But according to the sample, the total is24.

So there's a discrepancy. That implies that the model is incorrect.

So where's the mistake in the model?

Let me think again. The code's approach is to track for each position, the total number of a's, ab's, and abc's across all possible substitution paths.

But perhaps the model is not considering the order of characters properly. For example, when a 'c' is processed, the code adds ab_prev to abc. But ab_prev represents the total number of ab's up to the previous character. However, the 'c' can form abc's only if the ab's are before it.

But the code's approach is correct for that. For example, when processing a 'c', the code adds ab_prev to abc. This is because each ab that was formed before this 'c' can combine with this 'c' to form an abc.

But in the first example, according to the code's calculation, the final abc is42, but the correct answer is24. So what's wrong?

Let me think of another approach. Let's consider that the code's model accumulates the sum of abc's for all possible substitution paths. Each substitution path contributes its own abc count, and the code's model is summing them all.

So for the first example, the code's model says that across all 9 substitution paths, the sum is42. But the correct sum is24. So the model is incorrect.

Let me try to manually calculate the sum for the first example.

The first example's input is "ac?b?c".

The two '?'s are at positions 2 and4 (assuming 0-based index).

Each of these two '?'s can be a, b, c. So there are 3*3=9 substitution paths.

Let's list all 9 possibilities and compute the abc count for each:

Possible replacements for first ? (X) and second ? (Y):

Case 1: X=a, Y=a → string "aca bac" (spaces for clarity: "acabac"? Wait, original string is ac?b?c. Replacing X and Y as a and a gives "acabac".

As per sample note, this case contributes 2 abc's.

Case 2: X=a, Y=b → string "acabbc" → sample says 4.

Case3: X=a, Y=c → "acabcc" →4.

Case4: X=b, Y=a → "acbbac" →2.

Case5: X=b, Y=b → "acbbbc" →3.

Case6: X=b, Y=c → "acbbcc" →4.

Case7: X=c, Y=a → "accbac" →1.

Case8: X=c, Y=b → "accbbc" →2.

Case9: X=c, Y=c → "accbcc" →2.

Summing these: 2+4+4+2+3+4+1+2+2=24 → which is the correct answer.

But according to the code's model, the sum is42. So the code's approach is incorrect.

What's the problem?

The code's model must be overcounting somewhere.

Let's take the first example's code steps again. Let's see where the model's calculation goes wrong.

After processing all characters, the code's abc is42. So according to the model, the sum of all abc's across all substitution paths is42. But the actual sum is24.

So there's a big discrepancy here. So why?

Let's think of how the model processes the first example.

Let me step through each character again, but perhaps with more detailed steps.

Initial state: a=0, ab=0, abc=0, m=1.

Processing first character 'a':

a becomes 0 +1*1=1 (multiplier is1, so add 1*1=1 → a=1).

m remains1.

Processing second character 'c' (index1):

This is a 'c'. So:

abc += ab_prev → ab is0, so abc remains0.

So after processing 'c', abc=0.

Processing third character '?': this is X in the example.

At this point, a=1, ab=0, abc=0, m=1.

Processing '?' as a:

new_a = 1 *3 +1*1=4.

new_ab= 0*3 +1*1=1.

new_abc=0*3 +0*1=0.

m becomes3.

But wait, this '?' can be a, b, or c. Let's see what happens for each choice.

If X is a:

Then, the string so far is "aa" (after first two characters? No, first two characters are 'a' and 'c', then third is 'a' → "aca".

But the code's model for '?' would have:

a_prev is1 (before processing '?'), multiplier is1.

Processing '?' as a, b, c:

But in the code, the model treats the '?' as contributing a new a, ab, and abc based on each possible choice.

But perhaps the code is assuming that each choice is multiplied by the current multiplier (m), but the current multiplier is1 for the first '?'.

So after processing the first '?', the model's a=4, which represents the sum of all possible substitutions for X. For X=a, the a count is 1 (original a) +1 (from X=a). For X=b, the a count remains1. For X=c, the a count remains1. So total a's across all three choices is (1+1) +1 +1 =4, which is correct. So the code's a=4 is correct.

Similarly, ab after processing the first '?' is1. For X=a, the ab count is0. For X=b, the ab count is1 (from a_prev=1). For X=c, ab count is0. So sum is0 +1 +0 =1. Correct.

So code's model correctly calculates a=4 and ab=1.

Then processing the fourth character 'b' (index3):

Processing 'b' adds ab_prev + a_prev → ab becomes1 +4=5.

So ab=5. So after processing 'b', the model's ab is5.

This represents the sum of ab's across all possible X choices (a, b, c) and up to this point.

For example, X=a: after 'b' (third character is a, fourth is b), the ab count is (a=2 (original a plus X=a), then processing 'b' adds a_prev=2 → ab=0 (initial) +2=2. But across all X choices, the sum would be:

X=a: ab count is 2 (from a=2, then adding a_prev=2).

X=b: a=1, processing 'b' adds a_prev=1 → ab=1 (from X=b processing) +1=2.

X=c: a=1, processing 'b' adds a_prev=1 → ab=0 +1=1.

Sum is 2 (X=a) + 2 (X=b) +1 (X=c) =5. Which matches the model's ab=5. So the model is correct here.

Processing fifth character '?': Y.

At this point, a=4, ab=5, abc=0, m=3.

Processing this '?':

new_a =4 *3 +3 =15.

new_ab=5*3 +4 *3=15 +12=27.

new_abc=0*3 +5*3=15.

m becomes9.

So after processing the fifth character '?', the abc is15.

But how does this correspond to the actual contributions from Y?

Let's think:

At this point, the model's variables represent the sum over all possibilities of X and Y up to this point.

After processing Y (the fifth character), which is a '?', the abc is15. Let's see:

For each possible substitution of X and Y:

After X (third character) has three options, and Y (fifth) has three options. So 3*3=9 possibilities.

At the fifth character (before processing the sixth 'c'), the code's abc is15.

Each of these possibilities contributes to abc in some way. So the model's abc=15 is the sum of abc counts for all substitution paths up to this point.

But after processing the sixth character 'c', which is a 'c', the code adds ab_prev (27) to abc_prev (15), resulting in 15 +27=42.

But according to the example, the sum is24. So the code's model must be overcounting.

But where?

The issue is that when the model processes the sixth character 'c', it adds ab_prev (27) to abc. So this represents that each ab formed up to this step (after processing the fifth character) can combine with this 'c' to form an abc.

But in reality, the sixth 'c' is fixed. So for each substitution path, the sixth character is 'c', so for each path, the number of abc's added is the number of ab's up to that point.

But according to the model, after processing the fifth character, the ab count is27 (sum of all ab's across all substitution paths up to fifth character).

Then, when processing the sixth 'c', the code adds 27 to the abc count (15), resulting in 42.

But according to the example, the sum of abc's across all substitution paths is24. So why is the model adding 27?

Ah, here's the mistake.

The model's ab_prev is27, which represents the total number of ab's across all substitution paths up to the fifth character. When processing the sixth 'c', each of these ab's contributes to abc's. So for each substitution path, the number of new abc's added is the ab's in that path before processing the sixth 'c', multiplied by 1 (since the sixth character is 'c').

Thus, the sum of all new abc's added by the sixth 'c' is equal to the sum of ab's across all substitution paths before processing the sixth 'c', which is27. So the model's code adds27 to abc_prev (15), resulting in42. But according to the example, the correct sum is24.

But where is the model wrong?

Wait, the model's calculation for the sixth 'c' is adding ab_prev (27) to abc. But according to the example, the sum of abc's after processing all characters is24. So the model's calculation of27 is incorrect.

But why?

Let's think: after processing the fifth character (the second '?'), the code's variables are:

a=15, ab=27, abc=15, m=9.

Then, processing the sixth character 'c':

abc becomes15 +27=42.

But this implies that for each substitution path, the number of abc's is the abc count up to the fifth character plus the number of ab's up to the fifth character. But in reality, the sixth 'c' adds to each path the number of ab's present in that path before the sixth character.

But the sum of ab's across all paths is27. So adding 27 to the abc count (15) should give the correct total of42. But the sample's correct answer is24.

This suggests that the model's approach is not correctly capturing the abc's added by the sixth 'c'.

But why?

Let's take a specific substitution path and compute the number of abc's.

Take the path where X=a and Y=a (first example's first case: string "acabac").

The sixth character is 'c'. How many abc's are added by this 'c'?

The ab's before this 'c' are those formed up to the fifth character.

In the string "acabac", the fifth character is Y=a, which is the fourth position (index4). So after processing Y=a, the fifth character, which is a 'a', the ab's are:

Let's process this path step by step.

Processing first 'a' → a=1.

Processing 'c' → abc remains 0.

Processing X=a → a increases by multiplier (1) → a=2. ab increases by a_prev (1) * multiplier (1) → ab=1.

Processing 'b' → ab increases by a_prev (2) → ab becomes1 +2=3.

Processing Y=a → a increases by multiplier (3) → a=3*3 +3=12 (wait, no. For Y=a, which is a '?', the code's processing would be:

But in this specific path, Y is replaced by 'a'. How does the code model this?

The code's model treats all possibilities of Y, but this specific path is one of them.

But according to the code's model, after processing the fifth character (the second '?'), the ab count is27. For this path, the actual ab count is3 (from before Y is processed) plus 2 (from Y being processed as a 'a')? Or is this a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's model counts the sum of all possible ab's across all substitution paths. But the code's approach seems to be correct in accumulating the sum.

But in the specific case of the sixth 'c', the code's model adds27 (sum of ab's across all paths) to the abc count. But in reality, each path's contribution is the ab count for that path before processing the 'c', multiplied by whether the 'c' is present (which it is, since it's fixed).

So why is the model's sum27 not matching the actual sum of ab's across all paths?

Let's compute the sum of ab's across all substitution paths after processing the fifth character (second '?'), then multiply by 1 (since the sixth character is 'c') to get the total new abc's added.

For the first example, after processing the fifth character (the second '?'), there are9 substitution paths. Let's compute the ab count for each of these9 paths and sum them.

Let's enumerate all9 paths and compute ab after processing fifth character (before sixth 'c'):

We need to compute the ab count after processing the fifth character (Y) for each of the 3 choices of X and 3 choices of Y.

For each X (a, b, c), and Y (a, b, c), compute the ab count after processing fifth character (which is Y, a '?') and the fourth character is 'b'.

But this is going to be time-consuming, but perhaps necessary.

Let's start by processing each X choice (first '?') and then Y choice (second '?') and track ab count for each case.

Case 1: X = a, Y = a.

String up to fifth character: "a c a b a".

Processing the first 'a' (X) adds to a, as follows:

After X=a:

a =1 +1=2.

ab is0 +1 (from X=a being a 'a'? No. Wait, the first '?' is X.

Wait, the first '?' is processed as follows:

original a is1 (from first two characters 'a' and 'c').

Processing X (third character) as a:

a becomes1 *3 (for three choices) + multiplier (1) → 4. But this is the sum for all three choices. But in the case where X is a, the code's model is considering all three possibilities. So the actual ab count for X=a is1 (from the code's model's calculation for the third character).

But this is not directly applicable. Let's instead track each substitution path individually.

Alternative approach: track each substitution path manually.

For each substitution path (X and Y):

Let's compute the ab count after processing fifth character (before sixth 'c').

Then, the sixth character is 'c', which adds ab count to abc.

So for each substitution path, the number of new abc's added by the sixth character 'c' is equal to the ab count after processing fifth character.

Thus, the total abc's across all substitution paths is the sum of abc's generated before the sixth character plus the sum of ab's after fifth character multiplied by1 (since the sixth character is 'c').

In the code's model, the abc after processing fifth character is15. Then, the sixth character adds27 to it, totaling42. But according to the sample, the correct sum is24.

So the sum of ab's after fifth character is27. But according to the code's model, adding27 gives42, but the correct sum is24. So why is the code's sum of ab's after fifth character 27?

Let's compute the sum of ab's after fifth character manually for all9 substitution paths.

Let's start by processing each substitution path:

Processing each substitution path requires simulating the string up to the fifth character (before sixth 'c').

Let's consider each substitution path:

1. X=a, Y=a → string up to fifth character: "acab a".

But the fifth character is Y=a. The fourth character is 'b'.

Let's compute ab count:

- After first 'a': a=1.

- 'c' → abc remains0.

- X=a → a=2. 'b' (fourth character) → ab +=a (2) → ab=2.

- Y=a → a +=1 (multiplier is1? Not sure. Wait, each substitution path is considered individually.

Wait, this approach is getting complicated. Perhaps another way is to model each substitution path and compute the ab count.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's model is correct, but the sixth character is adding all ab's after fifth character, which includes all possibilities, but in reality, the sixth 'c' can't form abc's if the 'c' is not after the ab's.

But wait, the sixth character is fixed as 'c', so it's after the fifth character. So any ab formed before the fifth character (i.e., up to fifth character) can combine with this 'c' to form an abc.

So the code's model is correct in adding ab_prev (sum of ab's across all paths up to fifth character) to the abc count.

But according to the sample, this sum is27, leading to abc=15+27=42. But the sample's sum is24. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the code's model is adding the abc count from before the sixth character (15) to the new abc's added by the sixth character (27), resulting in42. But according to the sample, the total is24. So where is this 15 coming from?

The code's model tracks the total abc's for all paths up to each step.

The abc count after processing the fifth character is15, which represents the sum of abc's formed up to that point (before processing sixth character). Then, the sixth character adds the sum of ab's (27) to abc, resulting in42.

But according to the sample, the total sum of abc's is24. So the code's model's abc after processing fifth character is15, and the sixth character adds27, totaling42. But sample sum is24. So where is this discrepancy coming from?

Ah, perhaps the code's model is counting abc's that are formed before the sixth character, but in reality, in the sixth character, which is a 'c', all abc's are formed by combining ab's up to that point with this 'c'.

But the code's model allows abc's to be formed from previous steps (before sixth character) and also from this step.

For example, the abc's counted in abc_prev (15) are those formed up to the fifth character, and the abc's added by the sixth character's 'c' are27.

But according to the sample, the sum of abc's across all substitution paths is24, which is the sum of abc's formed by all steps, including the sixth character.

So according to the code's model, the sum is15+27=42. But the correct sum is24. So the code's model is overcounting.

This suggests that the model's approach is incorrect.

Where is the mistake?

The issue must be that the code's model counts abc's formed before the sixth character (abc_prev=15), but these abc's are not possible. Because in the sixth character, which is a 'c', any abc's formed before must have a 'c' that is part of the substitution.

Wait, but the sixth character is a 'c' (fixed), so any abc's formed before must have their 'c' in positions before the sixth character. But the sixth character's 'c' is part of the substitution paths. For example, in the substitution path where Y=c (fifth character), the fifth character is a 'c', which can form abc's with ab's before it.

Ah! The code's model tracks the total number of abc's formed up to each step, including those formed by previous 'c's. But the sixth character's 'c' can form new abc's with ab's up to the fifth character.

But the code's model's abc_prev after fifth character (15) includes abc's formed in the fifth character (Y substitution), which could be a 'c'. So in some substitution paths, the abc's are formed before the sixth character, and the sixth character's 'c' forms new abc's.

But according to the sample, in substitution paths where Y is a 'c', the abc's formed by the fifth character's 'c' (Y) are already counted, and the sixth character's 'c' forms additional abc's.

But the code's model counts both.

For example, let's take substitution path X=b, Y=c (string "acbbcc"). According to the sample, this case contributes4 abc's.

Let's see:

String: a c b b c c.

Processing:

- a → a=1.

- c → abc=0.

- X=b → a remains1, ab increases by1 (a_prev=1) → ab=1.

- 'b' → ab becomes1 +1=2.

- Y=c → adds ab_prev (2) to abc → abc=2. Also, this 'c' can form abc's with any ab's before.

- sixth character 'c' → adds ab_prev (2) to abc → abc=2+2=4.

So total abc's is4, which matches the sample's contribution of4.

In this substitution path, the code's model would have:

After processing fifth character (Y=c):

abc is15 (sum across all paths). But for this specific path, after fifth character, abc is2 (from Y=c's contribution). Then, sixth character adds2, total4.

But according to the code's model:

After fifth character, abc_prev=15 (sum of all paths' abc's up to fifth character). Then, sixth character adds27 (sum of all paths' ab's up to fifth character), leading to total abc=42. But in reality, the sum is24.

So the model's approach is incorrect because it's summing the abc's formed up to each step, but in reality, abc's can be formed at multiple steps (earlier steps and the current step).

But the code's model is adding the abc's from all possible steps correctly.

So why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the model is correct, but the way the problem is defined, each substitution path is a separate string, and the abc's in each string are computed as the number of subsequences in that string. The code's model is summing these counts correctly.

But according to the first example's code, the model produces42, but the correct answer is24. So the model is incorrect.

This suggests that the initial approach is wrong. So what's wrong with the model?

Alternative approach: think in terms of dynamic programming with state tracking the expected contributions.

The problem is to compute the expected number of abc subsequences multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of '?'.

But since each '?' can be replaced by a, b, or c, perhaps we can model the expected value of a, ab, abc for each position, then multiply by 3^k at the end.

But how?

Let's consider that each '?', when processed, has a probability of 1/3 of being a, b, or c.

The expected number of a's, ab's, and abc's can be tracked, then multiplied by 3^k to get the total sum.

But this approach might work.

For example:

Each character in the string can be:

- a: contributes 1 to a_count, 0 to ab_count, 0 to abc_count.

- b: contributes 0 to a_count, a_prev to ab_count, 0 to abc_count.

- c: contributes 0 to a_count, 0 to ab_count, ab_prev to abc_count.

- ?: contributes (1/3) a's, (1/3) b's, (1/3) c's.

So the expected value of a_count, ab_count, and abc_count can be tracked, and then multiplied by 3^k to get the total sum.

This approach would have O(n) time complexity, which is suitable for the constraints.

But let's see:

Initialize a, ab, abc as 0, and pow3 =1 (which represents 3^k_processed so far).

For each character:

if it is 'a':

a_new = a + pow3

ab_new = ab

abc_new = abc

pow3 remains the same.

if it is 'b':

a_new = a

ab_new = ab + a

abc_new = abc

pow3 remains.

if it is 'c':

a_new = a

ab_new = ab

abc_new = abc + ab

pow3 remains.

if it is '?':

a_new = a * (1) * (prob a, b, c) + contribution from each choice.

Wait, more precisely:

When the current character is '?', which can be a, b, or c with equal probability (1/3 each):

The expected value of a_new is:

E[a_new] = (a + pow3) * (1/3) (case when ? is a) + a * (1/3) (case when ? is b) + a * (1/3) (case when ? is c).

So:

E[a_new] = (a + pow3) * 1/3 + a * 1/3 + a * 1/3 = a * (1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) + pow3 * 1/3 = a + pow3/3.

Similarly for ab_new:

When ? is a: ab_new = ab (since adding a doesn't contribute to ab).

When ? is b: ab_new = ab + a_prev.

When ? is c: ab_new = ab.

So expected value:

E[ab_new] = ab * 1/3 + (ab + a) * 1/3 + ab * 1/3 = ab * (1/3 + 1/3 +1/3) + a * 1/3 = ab + a/3.

For abc_new:

When ? is a: abc_new = abc.

When ? is b: abc_new = abc.

When ? is c: abc_new = abc + ab.

So expected value:

E[abc_new] = abc * 1/3 + abc * 1/3 + (abc + ab) * 1/3 = abc + ab/3.

Additionally, for each '?', the pow3 should be multiplied by 3, since each '?' contributes 3 possibilities.

But the expected value approach would track the average per substitution, and then multiply by 3^k to get the total sum.

So the approach would be:

Track a, ab, abc as expected values per substitution (divided by 3^k up to that point). Then, after processing all characters, multiply abc by 3^k to get the total sum.

But this is a different approach. Let's see:

Initialize a=0, ab=0, abc=0, and pow3=1.

For each character:

if c == 'a':

a = a + pow3 (since each substitution up to now can add this 'a')

elif c == 'b':

ab += a

elif c == 'c':

abc += ab

else: # '?'

a_new = a * 3 + pow3 (since each of the three possibilities: a, b, c. For 'a' case, a increases by pow3. For others, no. So total is a*3 + pow3. Then divided by 3 to get the expected value?)

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

When processing a '?', the expected value of a increases by (a * (number of possible choices that don't add a) + (a + pow3) * (number of choices that add a)) / 3.

But for a '?', the possible choices are a, b, c. So:

a_new is:

a * 3 (since for each choice, the a_prev is carried forward) + pow3 (from the 'a' choice).

But the expected value is (a *3 + pow3) /3 = a + pow3/3.

Similarly, ab_new is:

ab *3 (from all three choices) + a_prev (from 'b' choice) * pow3.

But the expected value is (ab*3 + a_prev * pow3) /3 = ab + (a_prev * pow3)/3.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

For ab:

When the '? is replaced by 'a', the ab remains the same.

When replaced by 'b', ab increases by a_prev.

When replaced by 'c', ab remains.

So the sum of ab's across the three choices is ab *3 (from each choice) + a_prev *1 (from 'b' choice).

The average is (ab *3 + a_prev) /3 = ab + a_prev/3.

But how does this relate to the previous variables?

Hmm. Maybe this approach is not as straightforward. Let me think of the variables as expected values multiplied by 3^{k_processed}, where k_processed is the number of '?' processed so far.

This way, each time a '?' is processed, the pow3 is multiplied by 3.

For example:

Initialize pow3 =1 (no '?' processed).

For each character:

- if it's 'a', then a = a + pow3.

- if it's '?', then a = a * 3 + pow3 (since the 'a' choice contributes a new pow3, and the other choices contribute a*1).

Then, pow3 *=3.

This is the same as the code's original approach.

But in the code's original approach, the variables a, ab, abc are the sum over all substitution paths, multiplied by the multiplier (pow3) for the '?' processed so far.

So, the variables are already multiplied by 3^k_processed.

But according to this, the code's variables are correct, but the first example's model calculation gives42, but the correct answer is24.

So what is the issue here?

Let's re-calculate the first example using this approach.

First example:

n=6, s=ac?b?c.

Processing steps:

pow3 starts as1.

Processing 'a' (first character):

a =0 +1*1=1.

ab=0.

abc=0.

pow3=1.

Processing 'c' (second character):

abc += ab → abc=0.

Processing third character '?' (X):

a =1 *3 +1 =4.

ab =0 *3 +1 *1 =1.

abc =0 *3 +0 *1=0.

pow3=3.

Processing 'b' (fourth character):

ab =1 +4=5.

Processing fifth character '?' (Y):

a =4 *3 +3 =15.

ab =5 *3 +4 *3=27.

abc =0 *3 +5 *3=15.

pow3=9.

Processing sixth character 'c':

abc += ab →15 +27=42.

pow3 remains9.

So the code's abc is42. pow3 is9, but the code's final answer is42, but the sample's correct answer is24.

But according to the model, the answer is42. But according to the sample, it's24.

So where is the mistake?

Ah! The code's model is accumulating the sum of abc's for all substitution paths, but the sixth character is a 'c' and the code adds ab_prev (27) to abc. But according to the sample's manual calculation, the sum of ab_prev for all substitution paths is not27.

But according to the code's model, ab_prev is27. But manual calculation shows that the sum of ab's after fifth character is27. Let's verify.

For the fifth character (second '?'):

Each substitution path is:

X can be a, b, c.

Y can be a, b, c.

For each of these 9 paths, compute the ab count after processing Y.

Let's compute for each combination:

1. X=a, Y=a:

String up to fifth character: a c a b a.

ab count: after processing fourth character 'b', ab is2 (from a=2).

Processing Y=a (fifth character):

Since Y is 'a', it doesn't contribute to ab. So ab remains2.

2. X=a, Y=b:

Processing Y=b (fifth character):

ab increases by a_prev (2) → ab becomes2 +2=4.

3. X=a, Y=c:

Y=c → no contribution to ab. ab remains2.

4. X=b, Y=a:

Processing X=b (third character):

a remains1.

After fourth character 'b', ab is1 +1=2.

Processing Y=a (fifth character): ab remains2.

5. X=b, Y=b:

Processing Y=b (fifth character): ab becomes2 +1=3.

6. X=b, Y=c:

Y=c: ab remains2.

7. X=c, Y=a:

Processing X=c (third character): a remains1.

After fourth character 'b', ab is1 (from a=1) +1=2.

Y=a: ab remains2.

8. X=c, Y=b:

Y=b: ab becomes2 +1=3.

9. X=c, Y=c:

Y=c: ab remains2.

So the ab counts for each of the 9 paths are:

Path | ab after fifth character

1 → 2

2 →4

3 →2

4 →2

5 →3

6 →2

7 →2

8 →3

9 →2.

Summing these: 2+4+2 +2+3+2 +2+3+2 = 20.

So the sum of ab's after fifth character is20. But according to the code's model, ab_prev is27. This indicates that the model's calculation of ab_prev is27, which is incorrect.

This explains the discrepancy. The code's model says the sum is27, but the actual sum is20. So the model is wrong.

So why is the code's model's ab_prev for fifth character 27?

In the code's model, after processing the fifth character (second '?'):

ab_prev is27. But according to manual calculation, it's20.

So what's wrong with the code's model?

The code's model calculates ab_prev as ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier.

After processing the fifth character (second '?'), the code's variables are:

a_prev =4, ab_prev=5, multiplier=3.

Processing the fifth character '?' (Y):

new_ab =5 *3 +4 *3 =15 +12=27.

But according to the manual calculation, the sum of ab's is20. So the code's model is overcounting.

The code's model's formula for new_ab when processing a '?' is:

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier.

In this case, ab_prev is5, a_prev is4, multiplier is3.

So new_ab =5*3 +4*3=15+12=27.

But according to manual calculation, the actual sum is20. So the model's formula is incorrect.

But why?

The code's formula assumes that for a '?', the sum of ab's is the sum of ab_prev multiplied by 3 (for each choice) plus a_prev multiplied by multiplier (the number of paths before processing the '?').

But according to the manual calculation for the second '?', the sum of ab's is20, but the model's calculation is27.

So the model's formula is incorrect.

What's the correct formula for new_ab when processing a '?'?

Let me re-examine the case where the current character is '?' and how the ab_prev is updated.

When processing a '?', the ab_prev is updated as follows:

For each of the three choices (a, b, c):

- a: ab remains the same.

- b: ab increases by a_prev (a_prev is a before processing this '?').

- c: ab remains the same.

So the sum of ab's after processing the '?' is:

sum_ab = (ab_prev * (number of a and c choices)) + (ab_prev + a_prev) * (number of b choices).

Since there are three choices, one for each a, b, c.

So sum_ab = ab_prev *2 (a and c) + (ab_prev + a_prev) *1 (b) → ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

But the code's model uses ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier (current multiplier before processing the '?').

In the case of the second '?', the multiplier before processing is3.

So according to the code's model, the sum_ab is5*3 +4*3=27.

But according to the manual calculation, the correct sum is20.

So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Because a_prev in the code's model is the sum of a's before processing the '?', which is4. But in the case of the second '?', a_prev is4, which is the sum of a's after processing the fourth character (the 'b').

But in the manual calculation, for the fifth character (second '?'), a_prev is4, which is the sum of a's across all substitution paths up to fourth character.

But when processing the second '?', each substitution path may have a different a_prev.

For example, when X is a, Y is a, the a_prev after processing fourth character is2.

When X is b, Y is a, the a_prev after processing fourth character is1.

When X is c, Y is a, the a_prev after processing fourth character is1.

So the a_prev in the code's model is4, which is the sum of a's across all substitution paths up to fourth character. But when processing the second '?', the a_prev in each substitution path is different. So multiplying a_prev (4) by multiplier (3) would give 12, which is the sum of a_prev across all substitution paths.

But in the manual calculation, the sum of a_prev for each substitution path when processing the fifth character (second '?') is:

For each substitution path up to the fourth character (after processing 'b'):

The a_prev for each substitution path is:

X=a → a_prev=2.

X=b → a_prev=1.

X=c → a_prev=1.

Each of these has multiplier 1 (since there are three paths for X, and multiplier after first '?' is3).

Wait, after processing X (third character '?'), the multiplier is3. So for each of the three X choices, there are1 path each (total3).

When processing the fourth character 'b', each of these3 paths has their own a and ab counts.

For X=a:

a after X=a is2, ab is1.

Processing 'b' → ab becomes1 +2=3.

For X=b:

a after X=b is1, ab is1.

Processing 'b' → ab becomes1 +1=2.

For X=c:

a after X=c is1, ab is0.

Processing 'b' → ab becomes0 +1=1.

So after processing the fourth character 'b', the a and ab counts for each X choice are:

X=a: a=2, ab=3.

X=b: a=1, ab=2.

X=c: a=1, ab=1.

Then, processing the fifth character '?' (Y):

For each substitution path (X and Y):

For each X choice (a, b, c), and each Y choice (a, b, c), the ab count after processing Y is calculated as follows.

Let's take X=a:

a_prev for X=a after fourth character is2.

Processing Y=a: a becomes2 +1=3 (multiplier is1?), but according to the code's model, when processing Y=a (second '?'):

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's model is correct in that new_ab is ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier.

But according to the manual calculation, this formula is not correct.

In the case of the second '?':

After processing the fourth character 'b', the code's model has a=4 and ab=5.

But according to the manual calculation, the sum of a's across all substitution paths (three paths for X) is:

X=a: a=2 → multiplied by1 path (since after X=a, multiplier is1).

X=b: a=1 → multiplied by1 path.

X=c: a=1 → multiplied by1 path.

So sum of a's is2 +1 +1 =4 → which matches the code's model.

The code's model's a_prev is4, which is correct.

Similarly, sum of ab's after fourth character is3 (X=a) +2 (X=b) +1 (X=c) → sum=6. But according to the code's model, ab_prev after fourth character is5. So why discrepancy?

Wait, after processing the fourth character 'b', the code's model's ab is5. But according to the manual calculation, the sum of ab's for X=a, X=b, X=c is3+2+1=6.

So this indicates that the code's model is incorrect.

Ah! So here's the mistake.

The code's model is not correctly calculating the sum of ab's after processing the fourth character 'b'.

In the code's model, after processing fourth character 'b', ab becomes5. But manual calculation says the sum is6.

So the model is wrong here.

How?

Let's re-examine the code's processing of fourth character 'b':

Processing fourth character 'b':

Previous state after third character '?':

a=4, ab=1, abc=0, m=3.

Processing 'b':

new_ab = ab_prev + a_prev →1 +4=5.

So the code's model's ab becomes5.

But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's after fourth character is3+2+1=6.

So why is there a discrepancy?

Because the code's model is using a_prev (sum of a's across all paths) as the a_prev for processing 'b'. But when processing 'b', the ab_prev is increased by a_prev (sum of a's), which is4.

But in reality, for each substitution path (X=a, X=b, X=c), the a_prev for that path is added to ab_prev for that path.

So the sum of ab's after processing 'b' is:

sum (ab_prev for each path after processing third character) + sum (a_prev for each path after processing third character).

After processing third character (first '?'):

For X=a: a_prev=2, ab_prev=1.

For X=b: a_prev=1, ab_prev=1.

For X=c: a_prev=1, ab_prev=0.

Sum of a_prev for all paths: 2+1+1=4 (matches code's a=4).

Sum of ab_prev for all paths:1+1+0=2 (but code's ab is1).

Wait, the code's model's ab after processing third character '?' is1. But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's for X=a, X=b, X=c is1 (X=a's ab_prev is1) +1 (X=b's ab_prev is1) +0 (X=c's ab_prev is0) → sum=2.

So here's the mistake. The code's model's ab after processing third character is1, but the actual sum of ab's is2. So the model's calculation is incorrect.

This explains why, after processing fourth character 'b', the code's model's ab is5, but the actual sum is6 (2 +4).

So where is the mistake in the code's model?

It seems that the code's model's handling of the 'b' character is incorrect.

When processing a 'b':

new_ab = ab_prev + a_prev.

But a_prev is the sum of a's across all substitution paths, not the sum of a's per path.

But in reality, for each substitution path, the new ab is the ab_prev for that path plus the a_prev for that path.

So the total new ab is sum (ab_prev for each path) + sum (a_prev for each path) = ab_prev_sum + a_prev_sum.

But in the code's model, new_ab is ab_prev_sum + a_prev_sum.

But according to the code's model after processing third character '?', ab_prev_sum is1. But according to manual calculation, it's2. So why is there a discrepancy?

Because during the processing of the third character '?', the code's model computes new_ab as ab_prev *3 + a_prev * m.

But for the third character '?', which is the first '?':

ab_prev before processing is0.

m is1.

So new_ab =0 *3 +1 *1=1.

But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's after processing third character is1 (X=a: ab_prev=1) +0 (X=b: ab_prev=0 +1) +0 (X=c: ab_prev=0) → sum=1.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine processing the third character '?' (first '?'):

The code's model after processing third character '?' is:

a=4 (sum of a's for X=a, X=b, X=c), ab=1, abc=0, m=3.

But according to manual calculation:

For X=a:

a_prev after third character is2, ab_prev is1.

For X=b:

a_prev is1, ab_prev is1.

For X=c:

a_prev is1, ab_prev is0.

Sum of ab's is1+1+0=2.

But code's model has ab=1. So there's a discrepancy.

This indicates that the code's model's formula for ab when processing '?' is incorrect.

So why is the code's model's ab=1 after processing third character '?', but the manual sum is2?

Because the code's model uses:

ab_prev *3 + a_prev * m.

In this case, ab_prev is0 (before processing third character '?'), a_prev is1 (before processing third character), and m is1.

So new_ab =0*3 +1*1=1.

But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's after third character is2.

So the code's model is incorrect.

Ah! This is the root of the problem.

The code's model for processing '?' is incorrect for ab.

The correct formula should be:

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier.

But in this case, multiplier is the number of paths before processing the '?', which is1.

So new_ab =0 *3 +1 *1=1.

But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's after third character is:

For X=a: ab=1.

For X=b: ab=1.

For X=c: ab=0.

Sum is1+1+0=2.

So the code's model is incorrect. So why?

Because the formula for new_ab when processing a '?' is ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier.

But in this case, ab_prev is the sum of ab's before processing the '?', which is0. a_prev is1 (sum of a's before processing the '?'), multiplier is1.

But when processing the '?' as a, b, c:

- For 'a' choice: ab remains0.

- For 'b' choice: ab increases by a_prev (1) →0 +1=1.

- For 'c' choice: ab remains0.

So sum of ab's after processing '?' is0 (a) +1 (b) +0 (c) =1.

But according to manual calculation, for X=a, the ab is1 (from previous step?), no. Wait, when X is a, the third character is 'a', which does not contribute to ab. So ab remains0.

Wait, for X=a:

After processing third character 'a', the ab is0.

For X=b:

After processing third character 'b', the ab is0 + a_prev (1) =1.

For X=c:

After processing third character 'c', ab remains0.

So sum of ab's after processing third character '?' is0 (X=a) +1 (X=b) +0 (X=c) =1. Which matches the code's model's new_ab=1.

But according to manual calculation earlier, the sum was2. What's wrong here?

Ah! I think I made a mistake in the manual calculation earlier.

The third character is the first '?'. So for X=a, the third character is 'a'. After processing this, the a increases by1 (from 1 to 2). The ab_prev is0. Processing 'a' does not affect ab. So ab remains0.

For X=b: third character is 'b'. Processing 'b' adds a_prev (1) to ab. So ab becomes0 +1=1.

For X=c: third character is 'c', which does not affect ab. So ab remains0.

Sum of ab's after processing third character is0 +1 +0=1. Which matches the code's model.

So why was my manual calculation earlier wrong? Because I was considering X=b's ab as1, but for X=a and X=c, ab is0. So sum is1.

Then, after processing the fourth character 'b' (which is a fixed 'b'), the ab_prev is1.

Processing fourth character 'b':

new_ab = ab_prev + a_prev →1 +4=5.

Which would be the sum of ab's for each path.

For each path after processing third character:

X=a: ab=0. a_prev=2. processing 'b' adds2 → ab becomes0+2=2.

X=b: ab=1. a_prev=1. processing 'b' adds1 → ab becomes1+1=2.

X=c: ab=0. a_prev=1. processing 'b' adds1 → ab becomes0+1=1.

Sum of ab's after fourth character is2+2+1=5. Which matches the code's model.

So the code's model is correct up to this point.

Then processing fifth character '?' (second '?'):

a_prev=4, ab_prev=5, m=3.

Processing '?':

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * m =5*3 +4*3=15+12=27.

But according to manual calculation, the sum of ab's after processing fifth character is20.

So there's a discrepancy. Why?

Let's compute it manually for each substitution path.

After processing fourth character 'b', the three substitution paths (X=a, X=b, X=c) have:

X=a:

a=2, ab=2.

X=b:

a=1, ab=2.

X=c:

a=1, ab=1.

Processing fifth character '?', which can be Y=a, Y=b, Y=c.

For each of these three X choices, we have three Y choices.

Total 9 substitution paths.

For each of these 9 paths, compute the ab after processing fifth character:

X=a:

Y=a:

ab remains2.

Y=b:

ab += a_prev (2) →2+2=4.

Y=c:

ab remains2.

Sum for X=a: 2+4+2=8.

X=b:

Y=a:

ab remains2.

Y=b:

ab += a_prev (1) →2+1=3.

Y=c:

ab remains2.

Sum for X=b: 2+3+2=7.

X=c:

Y=a:

ab remains1.

Y=b:

ab += a_prev (1) →1+1=2.

Y=c:

ab remains1.

Sum for X=c: 1+2+1=4.

Total sum of ab's after fifth character:8 +7 +4 =19.

But according to the code's model, it's27.

So why the discrepancy?

Because the code's model is new_ab =5*3 +4*3=27, which is supposed to be the sum of ab's after processing fifth character.

But manual calculation gives19.

So why is the code's model incorrect?

Because the code's formula new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier is not correct.

In reality, the sum of ab's after processing the fifth character is:

sum (ab_prev for each substitution path) *3 (since each path splits into three for Y choices) + sum (a_prev for each substitution path) *1 (since only Y=b contributes a_prev per path).

But sum (ab_prev for each substitution path) is5, and sum (a_prev for each substitution path) is4.

So according to the code's model, sum_ab =5*3 +4*3=27.

But according to manual calculation, sum_ab is19.

This indicates that the code's formula is incorrect.

The correct formula should be:

sum_ab = (sum_ab_prev) * 3 + (sum_a_prev) * (number of paths where Y is b).

But number of paths where Y is b is equal to the multiplier before processing the fifth character, which is3.

So sum_ab = sum_ab_prev *3 + sum_a_prev * (1/3 *3) = sum_ab_prev *3 + sum_a_prev *1.

But according to the manual calculation, sum_ab_prev is5, sum_a_prev is4.

5*3 +4=19. Which matches the manual calculation.

But the code's model uses sum_ab_prev *3 + sum_a_prev *3, which gives 15+12=27.

So the code's model is incorrect. The correct formula for new_ab when processing a '?' is:

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

But the code uses new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier (current multiplier).

Ah! Here's the mistake. The multiplier at the time of processing the fifth character is3.

But the correct formula should be new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier_prev, where multiplier_prev is the multiplier before processing the fifth character.

But when processing a '?', the multiplier_prev is m. For example, when processing the fifth character (second '?'), the multiplier_prev is3.

So the code's formula new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * m (3) is incorrect. It should be new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

But why?

Because when processing a '?', the number of paths where Y is b is equal to the multiplier_prev (3), but each of those paths contributes a_prev (sum of a's) for that path.

But sum_a_prev is4, which is the sum of a's across all paths before processing the fifth character.

For each path where Y is b, the a_prev for that path is added to the ab.

But summing across all paths where Y is b, the total contribution is sum_a_prev (4) * 1 (since each of the multiplier_prev paths contributes a_prev).

Wait, no. For each substitution path before processing Y, there are three possibilities for Y. For each such path, when Y is b, the ab increases by a_prev of that path.

So the total contribution is sum (a_prev for each path) *1 (since each path has a 1/3 chance of choosing Y=b, and there are 3 choices per path).

But sum (a_prev for each path) is4.

So the total contribution is4 *1 =4.

Thus, new_ab = (ab_prev *3) +4.

Which is5*3 +4=19.

So the correct formula is new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

But the code's model uses new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier_prev (which is3), leading to 5*3 +4*3=27.

So the code's model is incorrect. It multiplies a_prev by the multiplier_prev, but it should multiply by 1.

This is the root of the problem.

So the correct formula for processing a '?' is:

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

But why?

Because when processing a '?', for each of the existing paths, there are three new paths (Y=a, Y=b, Y=c). For each existing path, when Y is b, the ab increases by a_prev of that path. So the total contribution is sum of a_prev for all existing paths, which is a_prev (sum).

So new_ab = ab_prev *3 (existing ab multiplied by three choices) + a_prev *1 (each existing path contributes a_prev once when Y is b).

But why multiply by1? Because for each existing path, only one of the three new paths (Y=b) contributes a_prev of that path to ab.

So the sum over all paths is:

sum_ab_prev *3 (for all three choices) + sum_a_prev *1 (only Y=b for each existing path).

Thus, the correct formula for new_ab when processing a '?' is:

new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev *1.

The code's model uses new_ab = ab_prev *3 + a_prev * multiplier_prev, which is incorrect.

So the correct code should have:

For processing a '?':

new_a = a *3 + multiplier.

new_ab = ab *3 + a.

new_abc = abc *3 + ab.

multiplier = multiplier *3.

This is because, when processing a '?', the multiplier_prev (before processing) is m, and the contribution for Y=b is a_prev (sum of a's across all existing paths) multiplied by 1 (since each existing path contributes a_prev once when Y is b).

Thus, the correct formula for new_ab is ab_prev *3 + a_prev.

So in the code's model, during processing of a '?', the new_ab should be ab_prev *3 + a_prev, not multiplied by the multiplier.

This is the key mistake in the original code.

So, the correct code would be:

When the character is '?':

new_a = (a *3) + multiplier

new_ab = (ab *3) + a

new_abc = (abc *3) + ab

multiplier *=3

Let's re-calculate the first example with this correction.

First example:

Processing third character '?' (first '?'):

a_prev=1, ab_prev=0, multiplier=1.

new_a =1*3 +1=4.

new_ab=0*3 +1=1.

new_abc=0*3 +0=0.

multiplier=3.

Processing fourth character 'b':

new_ab =1 +4=5.

Processing fifth character '?' (second '?'):

a_prev=4, ab_prev=5, multiplier=3.

new_a=4*3 +3=15.

new_ab=5*3 +4=19.

new_abc=0*3 +5=5.

multiplier=9.

Processing sixth character 'c':

new_abc =5 +19=24.

Thus, the code's model now gives abc=24, which matches the first example.

So the mistake in the original code was multiplying a_prev by the multiplier in the new_ab calculation for '?'. The correct approach is to multiply a_prev by1.

Thus, the corrected code should have for '?':

new_ab = ab *3 + a.

Not ab*3 + a * multiplier.

So the correct code is:

When character is '?':

new_a = a *3 + multiplier

new_ab = ab *3 + a

new_abc = abc *3 + ab

multiplier = multiplier *3

With this correction, the first example now returns24.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    a = 0
    ab = 0
    abc = 0
    multiplier = 1

    for char in s:
        if char == 'a':
            new_a = (a + multiplier) % MOD
            new_ab = ab % MOD
            new_abc = abc % MOD
        elif char == 'b':
            new_a = a % MOD
            new_ab = (ab + a) % MOD
            new_abc = abc % MOD
        elif char == 'c':
            new_a = a % MOD
            new_ab = ab % MOD
            new_abc = (abc + ab) % MOD
        else:  # char is '?'
            new_a = (a * 3 + multiplier) % MOD
            new_ab = (ab * 3 + a) % MOD
            new_abc = (abc * 3 + ab) % MOD
            multiplier = (multiplier * 3) % MOD
        
        a, ab, abc = new_a, new_ab, new_abc

    print(abc % MOD, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()

```output

We need to adjust the way new_ab is calculated for '?' characters.

Thus, the correct code is:

Read the input, process each character, and for each '?', update new_ab as ab *3 + a, not ab *3 + a * multiplier.

With this correction, the code should now work correctly.

To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of subsequences "abc" in all possible strings formed by replacing the question marks in the given string with 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes up to 200,000 characters.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with State Tracking**: We track the number of subsequences 'a', 'ab', and 'abc' as we process each character in the string.
2. **Handling Question Marks**: Each question mark can be replaced by 'a', 'b', or 'c'. We need to consider all possible replacements and their contributions to the subsequences.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to keep the numbers manageable.

### Key Insights
- **State Variables**: Use three variables to track the number of 'a's, 'ab's, and 'abc's formed up to the current position.
- **Question Marks Contribution**: When encountering a question mark, each possible replacement ('a', 'b', 'c') contributes to the subsequences. We compute the contributions for all possibilities and update the state variables accordingly.
- **Efficient Calculation**: For each question mark, the number of possible strings triples. We handle this by scaling the current counts and adding contributions from each possible replacement.

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

a = 0
ab = 0
abc = 0
multiplier = 1

for char in s:
    if char == 'a':
        new_a = (a + multiplier) % MOD
        new_ab = ab % MOD
        new_abc = abc % MOD
    elif char == 'b':
        new_a = a % MOD
        new_ab = (ab + a) % MOD
        new_abc = abc % MOD
    elif char == 'c':
        new_a = a % MOD
        new_ab = ab % MOD
        new_abc = (abc + ab) % MOD
    else:  # char is '?'
        new_a = (a * 3 + multiplier) % MOD
        new_ab = (ab * 3 + a) % MOD
        new_abc = (abc * 3 + ab) % MOD
        multiplier = (multiplier * 3) % MOD
    
    a, ab, abc = new_a, new_ab, new_abc

print(abc % MOD)
```

### Explanation
- **State Variables Initialization**: `a`, `ab`, and `abc` start at 0. `multiplier` tracks the number of possible strings formed due to question marks.
- **Character Processing**:
  - For 'a', increment the count of 'a's by the current multiplier.
  - For 'b', update the count of 'ab's by adding the current count of 'a's.
  - For 'c', update the count of 'abc's by adding the current count of 'ab's.
  - For '?', compute contributions from all three possible replacements and update the state variables accordingly. The multiplier is tripled as each question mark introduces three possibilities.
- **Modulo Operations**: Ensure all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

This approach efficiently tracks the necessary counts and handles all possible replacements of question marks in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
