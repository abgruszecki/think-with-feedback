Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to process a string according to specific rules about consecutive vowels. Let's break down the problem.

First, the rules: all consecutive equal vowels should be combined into one, except if the vowel is 'e' or 'o' and they appear exactly two times in a row. In those cases, we leave them as two. So, for example, three 'e's would become one, but two 'e's stay as two. But wait, wait. Wait, the example given in the problem statement shows that 'iiii' becomes 'i', which is correct. The example with 'eeemeentatioon' becomes 'eemeentatioon'—so let me check the third example.

Wait, the third example input is "iiiimpleeemeentatiioon". The output is "implemeentatioon". Let's see: the input starts with 'iiii', which becomes 'i'. Then 'mpleeem'—the 'eeee' becomes 'e', but there's an 'm' in between. Wait, perhaps the consecutive 'e's after the 'm'? Let's see. The 'eeem' part: the first 'ee' (exactly two) would stay, but then another 'e' would make it three, so those three would collapse into one. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.

The problem statement says: consecutive equal vowels are combined except for 'e' or 'o' when they repeat exactly two times. So the rule is: for any group of consecutive same vowels, if the vowel is 'e' or 'o' and the count is exactly 2, leave it. Otherwise, replace the group with a single occurrence.

Wait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.

The exception is: if letters "e" or "o" repeat in a row exactly 2 times, like in "feet" and "foot", the program must skip them. So, when we have exactly two 'e's or two 'o's, we don't merge them. But if they are in a group longer than two, then they are merged into one. But if they are in a group of exactly two, they are left as two.

So, for example, a group of two 'e's becomes two 'e's, but a group of three 'e's becomes one. Similarly, a group of two 'o's remains two, but longer groups are merged.

Other vowels (a, i, u, y) when in consecutive groups, regardless of the length (even if exactly two), are merged into one. So, for example, two 'a's become one, three 'i's become one, etc.

So the approach is to iterate through the string, group consecutive same characters, and apply these rules.

Now, the steps to solve the problem:

1. Iterate through the string, group consecutive same characters.
2. For each group:
   a. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y):
      i. If the character is 'e' or 'o' and the group's length is exactly 2: keep both.
      ii. Else: keep one.
   b. If it's not a vowel: keep all the characters (since non-vowels are not processed).
3. Build the resulting string from the processed groups.

So, the key is to process each group of same characters. For vowels, check if they are 'e' or 'o' and have a length of exactly two. Otherwise, reduce to one.

Now, the challenge is to process this efficiently for large inputs (n up to 1e5). So, the algorithm needs to be O(n) time.

How to implement this?

We can iterate through the string, track the current group's character and count. For each character:

- If it's the same as the current group's character, increment count.
- Else, process the current group, reset current to the new character.

After the loop ends, process the last group.

Processing each group:

If the group's character is a vowel:

   Check if it's 'e' or 'o' and the count is exactly 2: then append two of them.

   Else, append one.

Else:

   Append all the characters (since non-vowel groups are not modified).

Wait, no. For non-vowel groups, all consecutive same characters are left as is. Because the problem statement says that the program must combine all consecutive equal vowels. Non-vowels are not affected.

So, for non-vowel groups, we just append the entire group as is.

So the steps are:

Loop through each group:

For group (char, count):

   if char is in vowels:

      if (char is 'e' or 'o') and count == 2:

          append two of the char

      else:

          append one of the char

   else:

      append count copies of char (i.e., the group as is)

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that non-vowel groups are not processed. So consecutive non-vowel characters are left as is. For example, if the input has 'bb', which is non-vowel, then they stay as 'bb'.

So for non-vowel groups, we append all the characters (count times the character).

But for vowel groups, we process according to the rules.

So the approach is correct.

Now, how to efficiently group the characters. For example, in Python, we can loop through each character and track the current group.

Let's think of code:

Initialize previous_char as first character, count as 1.

Then, for each next character in s[1:]:

   if same as previous_char, increment count.

   else:

       process the group (previous_char, count)

       reset previous_char to current, count to 1.

After loop ends, process the last group.

But in Python, for a string of 1e5 characters, this approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable.

But in code, how to handle this.

So, the code steps:

n = int(input())

s = input().strip()

result = []
prev_char = None
count = 0

for char in s:
    if char == prev_char:
        count +=1
    else:
        if prev_char is not None:
            # process the group
            if prev_char in {'a','e','i','o','u','y'}:
                # vowel group
                if prev_char in {'e','o'} and count ==2:
                    result.append( prev_char *2 )
                else:
                    result.append( prev_char )
            else:
                # non-vowel group, append all
                result.append( prev_char * count )
        prev_char = char
        count =1
# process the last group
if prev_char is not None:
    if prev_char in {'a','e','i','o','u','y'}:
        if prev_char in {'e','o'} and count ==2:
            result.append( prev_char *2 )
        else:
            result.append( prev_char )
    else:
        result.append( prev_char * count )

Then, join the result list and print.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when the group is a vowel group, and the count is 2 for e or o, then we append two. Otherwise, we append one. But for non-vowel groups, we append the entire group as is.

But in code, for a non-vowel group, the code appends prev_char multiplied by count, which is the same as the group.

But for vowel groups, we append either 2 characters (if e/o and count 2) or 1 otherwise.

Yes.

Testing this with the examples:

First example:

Input: pobeeeedaaaaa

Group breakdown:

p: non-vowel, count 1 → append 'p'

o: vowel, count 1 → append 'o'

b: non-vowel, count 1 → append 'b'

e's: count 4 (since 'eeee' in input). So group is e, count 4. Since e is in e/o, but count is not 2. So append 'e'.

Then d: non-vowel, count 1 → append 'd'.

a's: count 5. So vowel group. a is not e/o. So append 'a'.

So the result is p o b e d a → 'pobeda', which matches the first example.

Second example input: iiiimpleeemeentatiioon

Group breakdown:

i's: count 4 → vowel (i), so append 'i'

m: non-vowel, count 1 → 'm'

p: non-vowel → 'p'

l: non-vowel → 'l'

e's: count 3 → e is e/o. count 3 is not 2 → append 'e'

e's again (from 'eeem'?), wait the input is 'iiiimpleeemeentatiioon'.

Let me parse the input as:

Original input string is 'iiiimpleeemeentatiioon'.

Breaking down into groups:

i (4) → 'i'

m (1) → 'm'

p (1) → 'p'

l (1) → 'l'

e (3) → group of e's, count 3 → since count is not 2, append 'e'.

Then e (in 'eemeent') → next group? Wait, after the 3 e's, there's another e? Let's see:

Original string after 'iiiimple' is 'eemeentatiioon'.

So after 'iiiimple', we have 'eemeent...'.

So the next group is 'e' with count 2 (from 'ee')? Wait, let's step through:

Original input after 'iiiimple' is 'eemeentatiioon'.

So first 'ee' (count 2) → e group of 2. Then 'm' (non-vowel), then 'ee' (count 2 again?), then 'nt...'.

Wait, perhaps the input is 'iiiimpleeemeentatiioon' which breaks down into:

i (4), m (1), p (1), l (1), e (3), e (2), m (1), e (2), n (1), t (1), a (1), t (1), i (2), o (2), n (1).

So processing each group:

i (4) → vowel, not e/o. append 'i'.

m → append 'm' (count 1)

p → append 'p'

l → append 'l'

e (3) → e is e, count 3 !=2 → append 'e'

e (2) → e, count 2 → append 'ee'

m → append 'm' (count 1)

e (2) → append 'ee'

n → append 'n'

t → append 't'

a → append 'a' (count 1)

t → append 't'

i (2) → vowel, not e/o → append 'i'

o (2) → o, count 2 → append 'oo'

n → append 'n'

So the resulting string is 'im' + 'p' + 'l' + 'e' + 'ee' + 'm' + 'ee' + 'ntationn' → which becomes 'implemeentatioon' as per the example. So the code works here.

Another example: the third input is 'aeiouyaaeeiioouuyy' → output 'aeiouyaeeioouy'.

Let's see:

Groups:

a → vowel, count 1 → append 'a'.

e → count 1 → 'e'

i → count 1 → 'i'

o → count 1 → 'o'

u → count 1 → 'u'

y → count 1 → 'y'

a → count 2 → a is vowel, not e/o → append 'a'

e → count 2 → e is e, count 2 → append 'ee'

i → count 2 → not e/o → append 'i'

o → count 2 → o, count 2 → append 'oo'

u → count 2 → vowel, not e/o → append 'u'

y → count 2 → vowel, not e/o → append 'y'

So the output is a e i o u y a ee i oo u y → 'aeiouyaeeioouy', which matches the third example.

So the code works.

Now, considering edge cases:

Test case where a group is exactly two e's: should be left as two.

Test case where a group is two o's: left as two.

Another case: a group of three e's → becomes one.

Non-vowel groups like 'bbb' → left as 'bbb'.

So the code seems correct.

Now, in terms of code optimization.

In Python, appending to a list is efficient, but multiplying strings (like prev_char * count) for non-vowel groups can be a problem if count is up to 1e5. For example, if the input is a non-vowel group of 1e5 'a's, then for that group, we append 'a' * 1e5, which would create a string of length 1e5. However, this is acceptable because that's part of the output.

But in Python, concatenating large strings can be slow, but in this code, since we are building a list of strings (each group's contribution) and then joining them once, it's efficient. Because list appends are O(1) (amortized), and the final join is O(total length), which is the same as the input size.

So for the code, it's acceptable.

Now, in terms of memory. The list 'result' holds all the parts. For each group, we have a string part. For example, a group of 1e5 non-vowel 'a's would be represented as 'a'*1e5. But in Python, this is stored as a single string, which is efficient.

But what about if the input is all non-vowel characters? For example, a string of 1e5 'b's. Then, the code would process this as one group, append 'b'*1e5, which is correct and efficient. So no problem.

But in terms of code, when handling non-vowel groups, appending the entire count is necessary. But for non-vowel groups, even if the count is 1, we have to append that character once.

So the code is correct.

Another possible optimization is to check if the current character is a vowel before processing. Wait, but for each group, it's necessary to check if it's a vowel.

So the code is correct.

Now, possible issues:

- For the first group, when prev_char is None. The code initializes prev_char as None, count as 0. Then, for the first character, since prev_char is None, it will enter the else clause. So the first character is handled correctly.

Wait, let's see. The code starts with prev_char = None, count =0.

Wait, initial code:

prev_char = None

count = 0

Then, for char in s:

   if char == prev_char → first iteration, prev_char is None → no, so enters else.

So in the else block, since prev_char is None (first iteration), the code checks if prev_char is not None (which it is), so skips processing. Then sets prev_char to char (first character), count to 1.

But this misses processing the first character. Wait, no. Let's see:

In the first iteration (char is the first character of s):

prev_char is None → so char != prev_char → enters else clause.

In the else clause, checks if prev_char is not None (which it's not) → skips processing.

Then sets prev_char to char (first character), count =1.

So the first group starts here.

Then, for the next characters, if same as prev_char, count increases.

When the loop ends, the code processes the last group (prev_char is set, so it's processed).

But for a single-character string, this code works.

Wait, for example, n=1, s='a':

Loop runs once (char is 'a').

prev_char is None → enters else.

prev_char is None → skips processing.

sets prev_char to 'a', count=1.

Loop ends.

Then, code processes the last group: 'a' is a vowel. count=1. So append 'a'.

So the code works.

Another example: n=2, s='ee'.

Loop:

First iteration: char 'e'.

prev_char is None → else: no processing, set prev to 'e', count 1.

Second iteration: char 'e' → same as prev_char. count becomes 2.

Loop ends.

Processing last group: 'e' is e/o, count 2 → append 'ee'.

Which is correct.

So the code handles all cases correctly.

So the code is correct.

Testing the fourth example:

Input: 24
aaaoooiiiuuuyyyeeeggghhh

The output should be 'aoiuyeggghhh'.

Breaking down the groups:

aaa → a, vowel. count=3 → append 'a'

ooo → o, count=3. Since o is in e/o, and count !=2 → append 'o'

iiiu → i's count=3 → append 'i'

uuu → u, count=3 → append 'u'

yyy → y, count=3 → append 'y'

eee → e, count=3 → append 'e'

ggg → non-vowel, count=3 → append 'ggg'

hhh → non-vowel, count=3 → append 'hhh'

So the output is a o i u y e ggg hhh → 'aoiuyeggghhh' which matches the example.

So the code works.

Now, the code in Python:

But in the code, for non-vowel groups, the code appends prev_char * count. For example, a group of 3 'g's would be 'ggg'.

But in the code, when the group is non-vowel, we append the entire group (prev_char * count). So that's correct.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, handling the input. The first line is n, which is the length of the string. But in Python, reading the string via input().strip() will handle the input correctly. Since the problem says that the input string has length exactly n.

Thus, the code is:

Read n, then read the string.

Now, code:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

result = []
prev_char = None
count = 0

for char in s:
    if char == prev_char:
        count += 1
    else:
        if prev_char is not None:
            # process previous group
            if prev_char in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'}:
                if prev_char in {'e', 'o'} and count == 2:
                    result.append(prev_char * 2)
                else:
                    result.append(prev_char)
            else:
                result.append(prev_char * count)
        prev_char = char
        count = 1

# process the last group
if prev_char is not None:
    if prev_char in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'}:
        if prev_char in {'e', 'o'} and count == 2:
            result.append(prev_char * 2)
        else:
            result.append(prev_char)
    else:
        result.append(prev_char * count)

print(''.join(result))

Testing this code with the examples.

In the third example:

Input: 18
aeiouyaaeeiioouuyy

Processing each group:

a → count 1 → append 'a'.

e → count 1 → append 'e'.

i → append 'i'.

o → append 'o'.

u → append 'u'.

y → append 'y'.

a → count 2 → a is not e/o → append 'a'.

e → count 2 → e is e, count 2 → append 'ee'.

i → count 2 → append 'i'.

o → count 2 → append 'oo'.

u → count 2 → append 'u'.

y → count 2 → append 'y'.

Result is a e i o u y a ee i oo u y → which is 'aeiouyaeeioouy'.

Which matches the third example's output.

Thus, the code works.

Now, possible optimizations.

But in Python, appending to a list is efficient, and ''.join(result) is the fastest way to concatenate the parts.

Now, code is O(n) time and O(n) space, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Thus, this code should be correct and efficient.
