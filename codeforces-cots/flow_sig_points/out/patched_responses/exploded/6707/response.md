Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So we need to count the number of valid subsequences in the array b that meet certain conditions. The array b is built from a using bi = a_{i mod n}. And the constraints on the subsequences are a bit tricky. Let's break it down.

First, the conditions for the subsequence. The second condition says that for consecutive elements in the subsequence, the floor(i_j / n) + 1 equals floor(i_{j+1} / n). Let's think about that. The floor(i/n) gives the quotient when i is divided by n. So adding 1 would mean that i_{j+1} must be in the next block of n elements. For example, if i_j is in the m-th block (positions m*n to (m+1)*n -1), then i_{j+1} must be in the (m+1)-th block. So the subsequence's indices must be such that each consecutive pair is from consecutive blocks. So the entire subsequence is formed by selecting one element from each of x consecutive blocks. But wait, the first element can be from any block, but the next has to be from the next block after the previous one's block. Oh right, because the condition applies for each consecutive pair. So the subsequence must be such that each consecutive element comes from the next block. So the indices are in increasing order and their blocks are consecutive.

Also, the subsequence must be non-decreasing. So each element in the subsequence is >= the previous one.

So the problem reduces to counting all possible non-decreasing sequences where each element is taken from consecutive blocks, and the length of the sequence is between 1 and k, inclusive.

Now, the array b is built by repeating the array a multiple times. Since l can be up to 1e18, we can't process each element of b directly. So we need a way to model the blocks.

Let me think about the structure of b. The array b is constructed by concatenating copies of a. Each copy is a "block". The total number of complete blocks is m = l // n, and there are r = l % n remaining elements in the last incomplete block. So the array b consists of m full blocks and a partial block of r elements.

For example, if n=3 and l=5, then m=1 (since 5//3=1, 3 elements in the first block) and r=2 (5%3=2), so the blocks are [a0,a1,a2], [a0,a1].

But according to the problem statement, the indices of b are from 0 to l-1. So for each index i in b, the block number is floor(i / n). The first block is block 0 (indices 0..n-1), then block 1 (n..2n-1), etc. For l=5, the blocks are block 0 (indices 0-2), block 1 (3-4, since 5 elements: 3,4 are in block 1).

So the maximum number of complete blocks is m = (l-1) // n. Because the first block is 0, the next is 1, etc. So for l elements, the last block is (l-1) // n. So total number of complete blocks is (l-1) // n + 1? Wait, no. Wait, if l is exactly a multiple of n, then the number of complete blocks is l/n. But (l-1)//n +1 would be (n*m -1)//n +1 = m-1 +1 = m. Which is correct. So m = (l-1) // n + 1? Wait, no. Wait, for l=5, n=3: (5-1)//3 =4//3=1 → +1 → 2. But in that case, the first two blocks are 0 (indices 0-2) and 1 (indices 3-4). So the number of blocks is 2. Which is correct. So m = (l-1) // n + 1. So the total number of blocks is m. But each block except possibly the last one has n elements. The last block has r = l % n elements if l mod n !=0. Otherwise, it has n elements. Wait, no: for l=3, n=3, the last block (block 0) has 3 elements. For l=4, n=3, the last block is block 1 (indices 3), which has 1 element. So the total number of blocks is ceil(l /n). Which is the same as (l +n -1) //n. Alternatively, m = (l-1) //n +1. Because (l-1) //n is the 0-based index of the last block, so the number of blocks is (l-1)//n +1. So the total blocks is m = (l-1) //n +1. Each block 0, 1, ..., m-1.

So the first (m-1) blocks are full (each has n elements), and the last block (block m-1) has (l - (m-1)*n) elements. Wait, no. Let's see:

For example, l=5, n=3: m=(5-1)/3 +1=1 +1=2. Then (m-1)*n=3 → 5-3=2. So the last block has 2 elements. Which is correct.

Another example, l=3, n=3: m=(3-1)/3 +1=0 +1=1. So the last block has 3 elements (3 -0*3=3). Correct.

So for the blocks: each block i (0 ≤ i < m-1) is full (n elements). The last block (i = m-1) has s = l - (m-1)*n elements. So s can be up to n (if l is a multiple of n, s =n). Otherwise, s is less than n.

Now, the problem is to count all possible sequences of length x (1<=x<=k) where:

- The sequence is non-decreasing.

- Each consecutive element in the sequence comes from consecutive blocks. So the first element can be in block t, the next in t+1, etc., up to t + x-1 -1. Wait, for x elements, the blocks must be t, t+1, ..., t +x-1-1? Or t, t+1, ..., t+x-1? Wait, the first element is in some block, then each next element is in the next block. So for x elements, the blocks are consecutive. Like, for a sequence of x elements, the first is in block t, next in t+1, etc., the last in t+x-1. So the total blocks covered are x in number. So the maximum t where t + x-1 < m. So the starting block can be 0 up to m -x.

Wait, but how many possible starting blocks are there for a sequence of x elements? For x elements, the blocks are consecutive, starting from t, then t+1, ..., t +x-1. So all these blocks must be present. So the starting block t must be <= m-1 - (x-1) → t can be from 0 to (m-1) - (x-1) = m -x. So for each x, the number of possible starting blocks is m -x +1. But wait, if x exceeds m, then there are zero possible. So for each x, if x >m, then the number of sequences of length x is zero.

But since x can be up to k, and m can be up to (1e18-1)/n +1. But given that n can be up to 1e6, and k up to 1e6 (n*k <=1e6). So m can be up to (1e18-1)/1 +1 = 1e18. But that's way too big. So we need a way that doesn't iterate over each possible x for each possible t.

So the approach is to model the possible sequences based on their block structure and their non-decreasing nature.

Let me think about dynamic programming. Let's model the DP based on the last element's value and the number of elements in the sequence.

But given that the elements can be up to 1e9, we can't track each possible value. So perhaps we need to sort and use coordinate compression. The a array is sorted, then the elements in each block are the same as a, but repeated. So each block is a copy of a (or part of it for the last block).

Wait, the problem says that b_i = a_{i mod n}. So each block is a copy of a. The first block (block 0) is a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. Block 1 is a[0], a[1], ... again. Except for the last block which may be shorter. So in the last block, the elements are the first s elements of a.

So for the full blocks (all except the last one), each block is a full copy of a. The last block may be a partial copy.

So the problem can be split into two parts: sequences that are entirely within the full blocks, and sequences that end in the last block.

Wait, but the sequences can consist of elements from any consecutive blocks, which may include the last partial block.

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute the number of sequences in the full blocks (m_full = m-1 if the last block is partial, or m if all blocks are full). Wait, m is the total number of blocks. If m is (l-1)//n +1, then if l is a multiple of n, then the last block is full. Otherwise, it's partial.

So for the full blocks, there are m_full = (m -1) full blocks (if the last block is partial) or m (if last is full). Wait, m = (l-1)//n +1. So if l mod n ==0, then the last block is full. Because (l-1) //n +1 = l/n. For example, l=3, n=3: (3-1)/3=0, +1=1. So the last block is 0 (since index is m-1=0), which has 3 elements, which is full.

So for all blocks except possibly the last one, the blocks are full. The last block may be full or not. So m-1 blocks are full, and the last (m-th) block is possibly partial.

Wait, m is the number of blocks. So if l is not a multiple of n, then the last block is (m-1)th and has s = l %n elements. Otherwise, it has s =n elements.

So the first (m-1) blocks (if m>0) are all full. Wait, no. Let me see:

For example, when l=5, n=3: m=(5-1)/3 +1 =1 +1=2. So blocks 0 and 1. Block 0 is full (3 elements), block 1 has 2 elements. So the first (m-1) =1 blocks are full.

So in general, the first (m-1) blocks are full if m-1 >=0 (i.e., m >=1). Wait, no. Wait, m=2: blocks 0 and 1. If l=5, block 0 is full (3 elements), block 1 is partial (2 elements). So the first (m-1) =1 blocks (block 0) are full, and the last block (block 1) is partial.

So the number of full blocks is (m-1) if the last block is not full. If the last block is full (l mod n ==0), then all m blocks are full.

Wait, but m is (l-1)//n +1. So when l is a multiple of n, l =n * (m-1). Wait, for l=3, m=(3-1)/3 +1=0 +1=1. So l =3 =n*(m-1) +n → because m-1=0. So yes, in that case all blocks are full.

So in general, the first (m-1) blocks are full, and the m-th block (the last) is full only if l mod n ==0. Otherwise, it's partial.

So to split the problem, perhaps we can consider:

- Sequences that are entirely in the first (m-1) full blocks. So their x elements are spread across x consecutive blocks, starting from any t up to (m-1) -x. Then, the sequences can have x elements (x<=k) from these blocks.

- Then, sequences that end in the last block (m-1). The last element must be in the last block, which may be full or partial.

So the approach is to compute the contributions from the full blocks (handling up to x elements in sequences that can be taken from the full blocks) and then handle the sequences that end in the last block.

But how to model this?

Let me think about dynamic programming. For the full blocks, each block is a copy of a. So the elements in each full block are the same as in a. So the possible transitions between elements in consecutive blocks can be precomputed.

The key idea is that for sequences in full blocks, since each block is the same as a, the transitions between elements can be precomputed once and then raised to the number of possible transitions (number of full blocks minus x +1 or something like that). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can model the DP for sequences of length up to k, where each step represents adding an element from the next block.

Let's think of DP[i][j] as the number of sequences of length j, ending with a value <=i. Then, for each block, we can process the elements and update the DP.

But since the blocks are repeated, perhaps we can compute for how many times a full block contributes, and then use matrix exponentiation or similar techniques.

Alternatively, for the full blocks, since they are the same, the transitions between consecutive blocks can be represented as a matrix, and then multiplied by the number of possible starting points (since the same transitions happen for each full block).

Wait, here's an alternative approach. Let's sort the array a and compute for each possible value the number of elements <= that value. Then, for a sequence of length x, the total sequences would be the product of the counts in each step, but considering the transitions. But perhaps not.

Another idea: the problem resembles counting non-decreasing sequences of length up to k, where each element must come from consecutive blocks. So for each possible starting block t, and for each x (1<=x<=k), the number of sequences starting at t and spanning x blocks.

But since the blocks are full (except possibly the last), we can model the count for sequences that start in block t and take x elements from t, t+1, ..., t+x-1. For the full blocks, each sequence of x elements is a product of choosing elements from each of x consecutive blocks, each element >= the previous. So the total for x is (number of possible t) * (number of non-decreasing sequences of x elements from a, considering that each element is from the next position in the next block).

Wait, no. Because for sequences that span x blocks, each element is chosen from a (for the full blocks), and the next element must be >= the previous. So the total number for x elements is (number of possible starting blocks) multiplied by the number of non-decreasing sequences of length x in a.

But wait, no. Because the elements in the blocks are arranged as copies of a. So for each block, the elements are a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. So when considering sequences that take one element from each of x consecutive blocks (each from the same a), the sequence must be non-decreasing. For example, if x=2, then the first element is from a, the second element is from a again, and the second must be >= the first. So the number of such sequences for x=2 is the number of pairs (i,j) where a[i] <=a[j], multiplied by the number of possible starting blocks. But the starting blocks would be t where t +x-1 < m_full (the number of full blocks is m_full = m-1 if last block is partial, else m).

Wait, but m is the total number of blocks (full or partial). So for sequences of x elements in full blocks, the starting block can be any t such that t +x-1 <= m_full -1, where m_full is the number of full blocks. So the number of starting positions is (m_full -x +1) if x <=m_full. Otherwise, zero.

So for sequences of x elements from full blocks, the count is (number of starting t) * (number of non-decreasing sequences of x elements from a).

Wait, but the elements are chosen from each consecutive block, so each element comes from the next block. But since all the blocks are the same, the choice of elements depends only on the sequence of a's elements. So for a sequence of x elements, the first element is any element from a, the second any element from a that is >= the first, etc. So the number of such sequences is the same for any x consecutive full blocks. So for each x, the total is (number of starting t) multiplied by the number of non-decreasing sequences of length x in a.

Similarly, for the last block (if it's partial), sequences that end in that block can be handled by considering sequences of x elements where the first x-1 elements are from x-1 full blocks, and the last element is from the partial block.

So the problem breaks down into two parts:

1. Compute the number of sequences that can be formed from the full blocks, for x from 1 to k.

2. Compute the number of sequences that can be formed with their last element in the partial block (if any), for x from 1 to k.

Now, how to compute the number of non-decreasing sequences of length x in a for part 1.

Let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem. For each position in the sequence (from 1 to x), and for each possible value in a, track the number of sequences ending with that value. The initial state is x=1: each element in a is a sequence of length 1. For x=2, the number of sequences is the sum for each a_j >= a_i of the counts from x=1. So this can be optimized with prefix sums.

This approach would have time complexity O(nk), which is acceptable since nk <=1e6.

So the plan is:

- Sort a, and compute for each element a_i, the number of elements >= a_i (but perhaps in a sorted way).

Wait, but for the DP, when building sequences of length x, the next element must be >= the last. So for DP[x][v] = number of sequences of length x ending with value v. Then, for x+1, the next value must be >=v. So for DP[x+1][u] += DP[x][v] for all u >=v.

But the values of a can be up to 1e9, so we need to compress them into a sorted list and map each a_i to its rank. Then, we can use prefix sums to compute the DP efficiently.

Here's how:

1. Sort the array a and assign each element a rank in the sorted order. Let's call the sorted array s, where s[0] <= s[1] <= ... <= s[n-1].

2. For each x from 1 to k:

   a. For x=1, the count is n (each element is a sequence of length 1).

   b. For x>1, the count is the sum over all possible sequences of x elements where each is >= the previous. This can be computed using a DP array where dp[x][i] is the number of sequences of length x ending with s[i]. Then, dp[x][i] = sum_{j <=i} dp[x-1][j}. To compute this efficiently, we can use a prefix sum array.

So the DP for sequences in a is O(kn), which is acceptable.

Once we have for each x the number of sequences of length x (call this cnt[x]), then the total sequences from the full blocks is sum_{x=1 to min(k, m_full)} (m_full -x +1) * cnt[x]. But wait, m_full is the number of full blocks, which is m-1 if the last block is partial, else m. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The number of full blocks is (m-1) if the last block is partial. Because m is the total number of blocks. So for example, in l=5 and n=3, m=2 (blocks 0 and 1). The last block (block 1) is partial. So the number of full blocks is 1 (block 0). So in general:

full_blocks = m-1 if (l %n !=0) else m.

But how to compute full_blocks?

Alternatively, full_blocks = (l //n). Because for l elements, each full block has n elements. The number of full blocks is l//n. Then, the remaining elements are r = l %n, which form the partial block. So for example, l=5, n=3: 5//3=1 (full blocks of 3 elements each), r=5%3=2 (partial block of 2 elements).

But earlier calculation of m (number of blocks) is (l-1)//n +1, which for l=5 is (4)//3 +1=1+1=2, which matches.

So the number of full blocks is m_full = l //n. Then, the number of full blocks is m_full, and the number of blocks is m_full + (1 if r>0 else 0). So the total blocks m = m_full + (r>0 ?1:0). But since m = (l-1)//n +1, this is equivalent.

So for sequences that are entirely in the full blocks (i.e., their x blocks are all full), the number of sequences for x elements is:

count_in_a = cnt[x] (number of non-decreasing sequences of x elements in a)

number_of_start_blocks = max(0, m_full -x +1)

contribution = count_in_a * number_of_start_blocks

So summing over x from 1 to min(k, m_full) gives the first part.

Now, the second part is sequences that involve the last block (if it exists). So the last block is the m_full-th block (if there is a remainder r>0), which has s =r elements (the first s elements of a). So sequences can end in this block. For these sequences, the first x-1 elements are from x-1 consecutive full blocks, and the last element is from the last block. The x elements must be non-decreasing.

So for x >=1 (since the last element can be part of a sequence of x=1), the number of such sequences is:

count_in_a_partial = number of non-decreasing sequences of x-1 elements in the full blocks (each from consecutive blocks) plus one element from the last block (which is a subset of a). So for x elements, the first x-1 elements are from x-1 consecutive full blocks (so x-1 elements from a, non-decreasing), and the last element is from the partial block (elements a_0, a_1, ..., a_{s-1}), and must be >= the previous element.

So for each x from 1 to min(k, m_full +1):

Wait, the last block is a single block. So sequences can start from a full block t, such that t +x-1 <= m_full. Because the first x-1 elements are in full blocks (t, t+1, ..., t+x-2), and the last element is in the partial block (t+x-1 must be <= m_full (since the partial block is m_full-th block)). So the number of starting blocks t is max(0, m_full - (x-1) +1) = max(0, m_full -x +2).

Wait, no. For sequences of x elements where the last is in the partial block, the first x-1 elements must be in consecutive full blocks (t, t+1, ..., t+x-2), and the last element is in the t+x-1-th block, which is the partial block (if any). So the condition is that t +x-1 <= m_full (since the partial block is m_full-th, but only exists if r>0). So t can be from 0 to m_full - (x-1). The number of possible t's is (m_full - (x-1) +1) if x-1 <= m_full. Otherwise zero.

So the number of starting positions for x elements (x-1 full blocks and the partial block) is (m_full -x +2) if x <=m_full +1. Because x-1 <= m_full → x <=m_full +1.

So for each x in 1<=x<=k:

- If x ==1: the last element is in the partial block. So the number of sequences is (number of possible t) * (number of elements in the partial block). But t +0 (x-1=0) <=m_full → t <=m_full. So t can be any of the m_full +1 possible blocks (since m_full is the number of full blocks, which are 0-based up to m_full-1, so t can be 0 to m_full → but wait, no. The partial block is the m_full-th block. So for x=1, the sequence is a single element in the partial block, which exists only if the partial block exists (r>0). The number of such elements is s =r. So the contribution is s * (number of possible starting t's, but for x=1, the starting t is t such that the element is in the partial block. Wait, for x=1, the sequence is a single element from the partial block, but how many such t's are there? The sequence has x=1 elements, which must be in the partial block. But the starting block is the partial block (t= m_full), but the partial block is only present if r>0. So in this case, the number of sequences is s (since each element in the partial block contributes 1 sequence) multiplied by the number of possible starting t's, which is 1 (since t must be m_full, which is the partial block). But wait, for x=1, the starting block is m_full (the partial block), and the number of possible sequences is s. So the contribution is s.

But how is this handled in the general case?

Wait, for x elements where the last is in the partial block:

The x elements are taken from x consecutive blocks: t, t+1, ..., t+x-1. The first x-1 blocks must be full blocks (so t, t+1, ..., t+x-2 <= m_full-1), and the x-th block (t+x-1) is the partial block (m_full). So the condition is t +x-1 = m_full. So t = m_full -x +1. But t must be >=0 → m_full -x +1 >=0 → x <=m_full +1.

So for each x, the number of possible starting t's is (m_full -x +2) if x <=m_full+1. Wait, no. Because t has to satisfy t +x-1 = m_full → t = m_full -x +1. But t must be >=0. So for each x, t can be m_full -x +1. But this has to be >=0. So x <= m_full +1.

So for each x, if x <= m_full +1, then there is 1 possible starting t (t = m_full -x +1), but only if t >=0. So for x <= m_full +1, and t >=0 → x <=m_full+1 and m_full -x +1 >=0 → x <=m_full+1 and x <=m_full+1 → x <=m_full+1. So the number of starting positions is 1 if x <=m_full +1 and t >=0.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

The sequence has x elements. The first x-1 elements are taken from x-1 consecutive full blocks (t, t+1, ..., t+x-2), and the x-th element is taken from the partial block (t +x-1 = m_full). So t +x-1 = m_full → t = m_full -x +1. But t must be >=0. So m_full -x +1 >=0 → x <=m_full +1.

So for each x where x <=m_full +1 and x >=1, there is exactly one possible t (t = m_full -x +1) as long as t >=0. So for x <=m_full +1:

t = m_full -x +1.

But t must be >=0 → m_full -x +1 >=0 → x <=m_full +1.

So the number of possible t's is 1 if x <=m_full +1 and m_full -x +1 >=0. Otherwise zero.

So for x elements ending in the partial block, the number of possible starting positions is 1 if x <=m_full +1 and x <=m_full +1. Wait, that's redundant. So the condition is x <=m_full +1.

But for the partial block to exist, r>0. So if there's no partial block (r=0), then this part contributes nothing.

So for each x from 1 to min(k, m_full +1), and if r>0, the contribution is the number of sequences of x elements where the first x-1 are from a (full blocks) and the x-th is from the first s elements of a (the partial block), with the x-th element >= the (x-1)th.

So to compute this, for each x, we need to:

1. Find the number of sequences of x-1 elements in a (non-decreasing), and then for each such sequence's last element, count the number of elements in the partial block (a_0 to a_{s-1}) that are >= the last element.

Multiply this by the number of possible starting positions (which is 1 if x <=m_full +1 and r>0).

So to compute this, for each x in 1..k:

- if r>0 and x <=m_full +1 and x<=k:

   count = (number of sequences of x-1 elements in a) * (sum for each possible last element in the x-1 sequences, the number of elements in the partial block >= that element) multiplied by 1 (number of starting positions).

So the problem now is to precompute two arrays:

- cnt[x]: the number of non-decreasing sequences of length x in a.

- For each element v in a, the number of elements in the partial block (a_0 to a_{s-1}) that are >=v. We can precompute this as a prefix sum in the sorted array.

But since the partial block's elements are a_0, a_1, ..., a_{s-1}, we can sort the partial block (or just process the first s elements of a, sorted). Wait, but the partial block is the first s elements of a, so the elements are a_0, a_1, ..., a_{s-1}. So to compute how many elements in the partial block are >= v, we can sort the partial block and use binary search for each v. But to optimize, perhaps we can sort the entire a array once and then, for the partial block, compute the sorted list of the first s elements. Then, for any query v, the count is the number of elements in the sorted partial block that are >=v. But the partial block is the first s elements of a. So their sorted list is a sublist of the sorted a array. Wait, no. The a array may have elements in any order. So the sorted partial block is the sorted list of a_0...a_{s-1}.

Alternatively, pre-sort the entire a array. Then, for the partial block, we can find the sorted list by taking the first s elements of a (if a is unsorted, this is not possible). So perhaps we need to sort the entire a array, but then when handling the partial block, we need to sort the first s elements. That's O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, the partial block's elements are a_0 ...a_{s-1}. So regardless of the original a array, these elements are the first s elements. So to compute for each v, how many elements in a_0..a_{s-1} are >=v, we can sort the partial block and use binary search.

But for each query, this could take O(s) time, which is O(n) in the worst case (s can be up to n). But if we pre-sort the partial block, then each query is O(log s).

So the steps are:

1. Sort the entire a array and compute the DP for sequences of length x (cnt[x]).

2. Sort the partial block (if exists) and compute for each possible value v, the number of elements in the partial block that are >=v.

But for the partial block, the elements are a[0..s-1], so we can sort this subarray once.

Now, for the second part:

For each x in 1..min(k, m_full+1):

   if x ==1: the contribution is s (number of elements in the partial block) multiplied by the number of sequences of length 1 in the partial block. But since the partial block is part of the sequences, x=1 here refers to sequences that have 1 element in the partial block. So the count is s (each element in the partial block contributes a sequence of length 1). But this is only added if r>0.

   else: the contribution is (number of sequences of x-1 elements in a) multiplied by the sum over all possible last elements of these sequences of the number of elements in the partial block >= that element. Then multiplied by the number of starting positions (which is 1 if x <= m_full+1).

But how to compute the sum over all possible last elements of sequences of x-1 elements in a of the count of elements in the partial block >= that element.

Wait, for each sequence of x-1 elements in a, the last element is some a_i. The next element (from the partial block) must be >=a_i. So the total is sum_{v} (number of sequences of x-1 elements ending with v) * (number of elements in the partial block >=v).

So for the DP, we can track for each x-1, the count of sequences ending at each possible value v. Then, for each such v, multiply by the count of elements >=v in the partial block, and sum all these products.

This can be done efficiently if we have for each x, the cumulative sum of the DP for sequences ending at values <=v. For example, after sorting the a array, we can use a prefix sum array.

Wait, let's think:

Let s be the sorted list of a. For each x, after computing the DP for sequences of length x, we can have a prefix sum array where for each i, sum up to i is the number of sequences ending with elements <=s[i].

Then, for a given value v, the number of elements in the partial block >=v is equal to the number of elements in the sorted partial block that are >=v. Let's call this function f(v).

So for sequences of length x-1, the sum over all possible last elements v of (count[x-1][v] * f(v)) is the total contribution for x-1 sequences followed by a valid element in the partial block.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative approach:

After sorting the a array, and the partial block's elements (sorted_partial), for each element in the DP for x-1, which is stored as a count for each value in sorted a, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the sorted partial block, and for each v in sorted a, compute how many elements in sorted_partial are >=v. Then multiply the count of sequences ending at v by this number and sum all.

But this would take O(n) per x, which for k up to 1e6 and n up to 1e6 would be O(nk) time. Which is acceptable.

But perhaps we can optimize this using binary search and prefix sums.

Let's proceed step by step:

First, compute the sorted a array.

sorted_a = sorted(a)

Compute the DP for sequences of up to k elements.

Then, for each x in 1..k, cnt[x] is the total number of sequences of length x in a.

But for the second part, we need more detailed information: for each x, the distribution of the last elements of the sequences.

So instead of just cnt[x], we need for each x an array dp_x, where dp_x[i] is the number of sequences of length x ending with sorted_a[i].

Then, for each x, we can compute the sum over i of dp_x[i] * (number of elements in the partial block >= sorted_a[i]).

To compute this sum efficiently:

1. Sort the partial block's elements (sorted_partial).

2. For each i in 0..n-1, compute the count of elements in sorted_partial that are >= sorted_a[i]. This can be found using binary search for sorted_a[i] in sorted_partial, and subtracting the index from the length of sorted_partial.

3. Precompute this count for all i, then for each x, compute the sum over i of dp_x[i] * count_i.

This would take O(n log s) time for the binary searches, where s is the size of the partial block (up to n). But if we pre-sort the partial block once, and then for each sorted_a[i], compute the count once, then during the DP processing, we can compute the sum.

But since the partial block is fixed (s is the number of elements in the last block), this precomputation can be done once.

So here's the plan:

- Compute sorted_a.

- Compute the DP for sequences of up to k elements. For each x, store dp_x as an array where dp_x[i] is the number of sequences of length x ending with sorted_a[i].

- Compute the partial block's elements (if r>0) and sort them as sorted_partial.

- For each i, compute count_partial_ge_i = the number of elements in sorted_partial >= sorted_a[i]. This can be done with binary search.

- For each x in 1..k:

   contribution_partial = 0

   if r>0 and x <= m_full +1 and x <=k:

      if x ==1:

         contribution_partial = s (since each element in the partial block contributes 1 sequence of length 1, and there are s elements)

      else:

         sum_val = sum over all i (dp_prev[i] * count_partial_ge_i), where dp_prev is the dp array for x-1.

         contribution_partial = sum_val * 1 (since there is 1 starting position)

      add this contribution_partial to the total.

So putting it all together:

The steps are:

1. Read n, l, k, and a.

2. Compute m_full = l //n (number of full blocks).

   r = l %n (elements in last partial block).

   s = r if r>0 else 0.

3. sorted_a = sorted(a)

4. Compute dp arrays for sequences of length up to k.

   Initialize dp[1][i] = 1 for all i.

   For x from 2 to k:

      Compute prefix sums of dp[x-1], then for each i, dp[x][i] = prefix_sum[i]

      where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of dp[x-1][0..i]

5. Compute the counts for sequences in full blocks.

   total_full = sum over x in 1..min(k, m_full) of (max(0, m_full -x +1)) * cnt[x]

   where cnt[x] is sum(dp[x][i] for i in 0..n-1)

6. Compute the contribution from sequences ending in the partial block (if r>0).

   sorted_partial = sorted(a[0:s]) if s>0 else []

   precompute count_partial_ge for each element in sorted_a:

      for each i in 0..n-1:

         v = sorted_a[i]

         use bisect_left to find the first index in sorted_partial >=v.

         count_partial_ge[i] = len(sorted_partial) - idx

   compute for each x in 1..min(k, m_full +1):

      if x >k: continue

      if x ==1:

         contribution = s

      else:

         if x-1 >k: continue (since x-1 >=1)

         sum_val = sum(dp[x-1][i] * count_partial_ge[i] for i in 0..n-1)

         contribution = sum_val

      num_start = 1 if (m_full -x +1) >=0 else 0

      contribution_partial += contribution * num_start

   add contribution_partial to the total.

So the total answer is (total_full + contribution_partial) mod 1e9+7.

But wait, for x>1, the num_start is 1 only if x-1 <= m_full. Because t = m_full -x +1 must be >=0.

So x-1 <= m_full → x <= m_full +1. So for x in 1..min(k, m_full +1), and r>0.

So the code needs to handle x from 1 to min(k, m_full+1), and for each x:

if x==1: contribution is s * 1 (since the starting t is m_full (the partial block) and x=1, so there's 1 possible starting t).

But for x>1:

the number of possible starting t is 1 if x-1 <= m_full → t = m_full -x +1 >=0 → m_full -x +1 >=0 → x <= m_full +1.

So the num_start is 1 if x <=m_full +1.

So for each x in 1..min(k, m_full+1):

if x ==1:

   contribution is s (number of elements in the partial block) * 1 (number of starting t's) → s *1.

else:

   sum_val (sum of dp[x-1][i] * count_partial_ge[i]) * 1.

So this contribution_partial is added only if r>0.

Now, the problem is to implement this efficiently.

But considering that n and k can be up to 1e6, and the steps involve O(nk) operations, this should be manageable.

But how to compute the dp arrays efficiently.

The DP can be computed using prefix sums. For each x, the dp[x] can be computed by taking the prefix sum of the previous dp.

For example:

sorted_a is sorted.

dp[x][i] = sum_{j=0 to i} dp[x-1][j]

But to compute this, we can precompute the prefix sums.

So for each x:

prefix_sum = 0

prefix = [0]*(n)

prefix_sum = 0

for i in 0..n-1:

   prefix_sum += dp[x-1][i]

   dp[x][i] = prefix_sum

   prefix[i] = prefix_sum

But this can be done in O(n) per x.

Thus, for k steps, this is O(nk) time.

This is acceptable since n*k <=1e6.

Now, code implementation steps:

- Read n, l, k.

- Read the array a.

- Compute m_full = l //n

- r = l %n

- s = r if r !=0 else 0

- sorted_a = sorted(a)

- Initialize dp as a list of lists. Since k can be up to 1e6, but we need to compute up to k steps, but n*k <=1e6, we can use a list of lists where each list has size n.

But in Python, this may require O(k*n) space. However, since n*k <=1e6, this is acceptable.

Alternatively, since each step x only depends on x-1, we can use two arrays: previous and current.

This reduces the space complexity to O(n) instead of O(kn).

Yes, that's better.

So:

prev_dp = [1] *n (for x=1)

current_dp for x=2 is the prefix sums of prev_dp.

But wait, for x=1, the sequences are of length 1, each element in a. Since sorted_a is sorted, each element is considered, and dp[1][i] =1 (the count is 1 for each element in the sorted array). But the actual count is n, since each element in a can be part of a sequence of length 1.

Wait, no. Because sorted_a is sorted, and the elements are a's elements sorted. So the count for x=1 is n, which is sum(prev_dp) = sum(1 for each element) =n.

For x=2, each element in sorted_a can be the end of a sequence of length 2. The number of sequences ending at i is the sum of all sequences of length 1 ending at j where j <=i.

So for each x, the current_dp[i] is sum_{j=0 to i} prev_dp[j].

Which can be computed with a prefix sum array.

So the code can be:

Initialize prev_dp as [1] *n.

cnt = [0]*(k+1)

cnt[1] = sum(prev_dp) =n.

Then, for x from 2 to k:

   compute prefix_sum =0

   current_dp = [0]*n

   prefix_sum =0

   for i in 0 to n-1:

       prefix_sum += prev_dp[i]

       current_dp[i] = prefix_sum

   prev_dp = current_dp

   cnt[x] = prefix_sum (sum of current_dp)

But wait, for x=2, cnt[x] is sum(current_dp) = sum_{i=0 to n-1} current_dp[i]

But current_dp[i] is the sum of prev_dp[0..i], so sum(current_dp) would be sum_{i=0 to n-1} (sum_{j=0 to i} prev_dp[j}) ) = sum_{j=0 to n-1} prev_dp[j] * (n -j). Which is not the same as the total sequences of length x. Wait, no. The cnt[x] is the total number of sequences of length x, which is sum_{i=0 to n-1} current_dp[i]. Because current_dp[i] is the number of sequences of length x ending with sorted_a[i]. So the sum of current_dp is the total.

Yes. So for each x, cnt[x] = sum(current_dp).

But in the code above, current_dp[i] is the prefix sum up to i. So sum(current_dp) is sum_{i=0..n-1} sum_{j=0..i} prev_dp[j} }.

Which is the same as sum_{j=0..n-1} prev_dp[j} * (n-j).

Wait, no. For each j, prev_dp[j} is added to all i >=j. So sum_{i=0..n-1} sum_{j=0..i} prev_dp[j} = sum_{j=0..n-1} prev_dp[j} * (n-j).

But sum(current_dp) is sum_{i=0..n-1} sum_{j=0..i} prev_dp[j}.

Which can be rewritten as sum_{j=0..n-1} prev_dp[j} * (n-j).

But for x=2, cnt[x] should be the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 2. Which is the number of pairs (i,j) where sorted_a[i] <= sorted_a[j]. Which is sum_{j=0..n-1} (number of elements <= sorted_a[j} in the array). Since sorted_a is sorted, the number of elements <= sorted_a[j} is j+1. So sum_{j=0..n-1} (j+1) = n(n+1)/2. But this is only if the array is non-decreasing and all elements are unique. But in reality, sorted_a may have duplicate elements, so the sum is correct.

But the code's approach is correct.

So the code for the DP is:

prev_dp = [1] *n

cnt = [0]*(k+1)

cnt[1] =n

for x in range(2, k+1):

   current_dp = []

   prefix =0

   for i in range(n):

       prefix += prev_dp[i]

       current_dp.append(prefix)

   cnt[x] = sum(current_dp)

   prev_dp = current_dp.copy()

But for large n and k, this can be slow. So we need to optimize the computation of the current_dp and the sum.

Wait, the sum of current_dp is prefix at i =n-1. Because current_dp[i] is the prefix sum up to i for the prev_dp. So the sum of current_dp is the sum of the prefix sums up to each i.

But the sum of current_dp is equal to the sum_{i} current_dp[i} = sum_{i} sum_{j=0 to i} prev_dp[j} }.

But this is the same as sum_{j} prev_dp[j} * (n-j), since for each j, it appears in all i >=j.

But this is not the same as the last element of the current_dp multiplied by something. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

But the code is correct as written, and for n up to 1e6 and k up to 1e6 (but n*k <=1e6), the code will run in acceptable time.

But wait, the constraints say n × k ≤ 1e6. So the product of n and k is at most 1e6. So for example, if n=1e6 and k=1, then the loop runs once. If n=1e3 and k=1e3, the loop runs 1e3 times, each with O(n) operations. So total operations are 1e6, which is acceptable.

So the code is feasible.

Now, for the contribution from full blocks:

total_full = sum over x in 1..min(k, m_full) of cnt[x] * max(0, m_full -x +1)

For example, if m_full=5 and x=3, then the number of starting positions is 5-3 +1=3.

For x=1, it's m_full -1 +1= m_full.

So this is correct.

Now, for the partial block contribution:

sorted_partial = sorted(a[:s]) if s>0 else []

precompute count_partial_ge[i] for each i (0..n-1):

count_partial_ge[i] = number of elements in sorted_partial >= sorted_a[i]

This can be computed using bisect_left.

Then, for each x in 1..min(k, m_full +1):

   if x >k: continue

   if r ==0: continue

   if x ==1:

      contribution = s

   else:

      sum_val = sum( prev_dp[x-1][i] * count_partial_ge[i] for i in 0..n-1 )

      contribution = sum_val

   num_start = 1 if (m_full - (x-1)) >=0 else 0

   contribution_partial += contribution * num_start

Wait, prev_dp[x-1] is the current_dp for x-1. But in the code above, after processing x, prev_dp is current_dp. So for x-1 steps, prev_dp holds the current_dp for x-1.

But the code for the partial contribution needs to access the dp[x-1] values, which may have been overwritten.

Wait, the way the code is structured, after processing x up to k, the prev_dp array is for x=k. But for the partial contribution, when x is up to m_full +1, which can be up to 1e18 +1, but since k is up to 1e6, the x in the partial contribution is up to min(k, m_full +1). So when m_full +1 is larger than k, we only go up to k.

So during the computation of the partial contribution, for x >=2, we need to get the dp[x-1] array. But in our code, after processing the DP up to k, the prev_dp is the dp[k], but we need to get the dp[x-1] for x-1 <=k.

But the code as written computes the cnt array and the DP arrays up to x=k. However, storing all the DP arrays would require O(kn) space, which is not feasible. So the code uses a rolling array, which only stores the current and previous steps. So after processing x steps, the prev_dp is the dp[x], and the previous steps are lost.

Therefore, to compute the sum_val for x steps in the partial contribution, we need to have the dp[x-1] array. But if the code computes the DP arrays up to x=k, and then for each x in the partial contribution, we need to access dp[x-1], this is not possible unless we store all the DP arrays.

This is a problem.

So the code approach must be modified to store all the DP arrays, which requires O(kn) memory, but with the constraint that nk <=1e6, this is manageable.

But storing arrays for each x from 1 to k:

In Python, this can be done by using a list of lists.

So modify the DP code to store all dp arrays:

sorted_a = sorted(a)

dp = []
dp.append([1]*n)  # x=1

for x in range(2, k+1):
    current = []
    prefix =0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix += dp[x-2][i]
        current.append(prefix % MOD)  # MOD is 1e9+7
    dp.append(current)
    cnt[x] = sum(current) % MOD

But for k up to 1e6 and n up to 1e6, this would require O(kn) memory. But since nk <=1e6, this is acceptable.

But the initial code can't use this approach because the constraints said that nk <=1e6. So this is manageable.

So the code should precompute all the dp arrays up to x=k, and store them in a list.

Then, for the partial contribution, for each x in 1..min(k, m_full+1):

   if x ==1:

      contribution is s

   else:

      sum_val = sum( dp[x-2][i] * count_partial_ge[i] for i in 0..n-1 )

      contribution is sum_val

So the code must store all the dp arrays. This is possible.

Alternatively, we can precompute for each x from 1 to k, the sum of the dp arrays multiplied by count_partial_ge[i], but that's O(kn) time.

But with the constraints, this is feasible.

So the code steps are:

Compute the sorted_a and sorted_partial.

Compute the DP arrays for x from 1 to k.

Compute the count_partial_ge for each sorted_a[i].

Then, for each x in 1..min(k, m_full+1):

   if x ==1:

      contrib = s if r>0 else 0

   else:

      sum_val = sum( dp[x-2][i] * count_partial_ge[i] for i in 0..n-1 )

      contrib = sum_val

   if x <= m_full +1:

      if r>0:

         contribution_partial += contrib

Then multiply by 1 (number of starting positions).

Wait, the number of starting positions is 1 if x <= m_full+1. So for each x, as long as x <= m_full+1 and r>0, the contribution is added once.

So the code for the partial contribution is:

contribution_partial =0

if r>0:

   sorted_partial = sorted(a[:s])

   # precompute count_partial_ge[i] for each i in 0..n-1

   count_partial_ge = [0]*n

   for i in range(n):

       v = sorted_a[i]

       # find the first index in sorted_partial >= v using bisect_left

       idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_partial, v)

       count_partial_ge[i] = len(sorted_partial) - idx

   max_x_partial = min(k, m_full +1)

   for x in range(1, max_x_partial +1):

       if x >k:

           continue

       if x ==1:

           contrib = s

       else:

           if (x-1) >k:

               continue

           # x-1 is the length of the DP array

           # x-1 ranges from 1 to k-1

           # dp[x-2] is the array for sequences of length x-1

           sum_val = 0

           for i in range(n):

               sum_val += dp[x-2][i] * count_partial_ge[i]

               sum_val %= MOD

           contrib = sum_val

       # check if there is at least one starting position

       # x <= m_full +1 → t = m_full -x +1 >=0 → m_full >=x-1 → x <= m_full +1

       contribution_partial += contrib

       contribution_partial %= MOD

So the code is:

Now, putting it all together with the MOD 1e9+7.

But there's one more thing to handle: the modulo operations. All calculations should be done modulo 1e9+7.

So in the code:

MOD = 10**9+7

Now, the code:

Read n, l, k.

a = list of integers.

Compute m_full = l //n

r = l %n

s = r if r>0 else 0

sorted_a = sorted(a)

Compute dp arrays for x from 1 to k:

   dp is a list of lists. dp[0] is for x=1.

   dp[0][i] =1 for all i.

   For x from 2 to k:

       current_dp is computed as prefix sums of dp[x-2].

Another test case:

Sample Input 2:

5 10 3

1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:25

m_full=10//5=2. r=0. So no partial block.

So the code's contribution_partial is 0.

For full blocks:

max_x_full= min(3,2) =2.

x=1: cnt[1] =5, start_count=2-1+1=2 → contribution 5*2=10.

x=2: cnt[2] = sum of current_dp, which is for x=2:

dp[1] (x=2) is [1, 3,6, 10, 15] → sum is 35.

cnt[2] =35. start_count=2-2+1=1 → contribution 35*1=35.

x=3: min(3,2) is 2, so no contribution.

So total_full=10+35=45. But sample output is 25. So this suggests that the code is wrong.

Wait, what's wrong here.

Wait, sample input 2's output is 25, but according to the code's logic for full blocks, the answer is 10+35=45. But the sample output is 25. So there's a mistake.

Hmm, this indicates a problem in the code's logic.

Wait, sample input 2:

n=5, l=10, k=3.

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

l=10, which is 5*2, so m_full=2, r=0. So there are two full blocks.

The array b is [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5].

But the sequences must be such that each consecutive element is from consecutive blocks.

For example, a sequence of length 2 must have elements from block t and t+1.

The sample output is 25. So what's the correct calculation.

The code's current approach is:

For x=1: sequences from any single block. So each of the 2 full blocks contributes 5 elements. So 2*5=10.

For x=2: sequences of two elements from two consecutive blocks. The number of such sequences is the number of non-decreasing pairs (a_i, a_j) multiplied by the number of starting blocks (2-2+1=1 → 1 starting block).

But the number of non-decreasing pairs (a_i, a_j) is sum_{j=0..4} (j+1) → 1+2+3+4+5=15. So 15 *1=15.

So total_full is 10 +15=25, which matches the sample output.

But according to the code's calculation:

cnt[2] = sum(current_dp), which for x=2:

sorted_a is [1,2,3,4,5].

dp[1] (x=2) is:

current_dp[i] = sum_{j=0..i} dp[0][j].

dp[0] for x=1 is [1,1,1,1,1].

So for x=2:

current_dp[0] =1

current_dp[1] =1+1=2

current_dp[2] =1+1+1=3

current_dp[3] =4

current_dp[4] =5.

sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15 → cnt[2] =15.

For x=2, the start_count is 2-2+1=1. So contribution is 15 *1=15.

x=1: 5 *2=10.

So total_full=25, which matches the sample output. But according to the code's previous calculation, the code would compute cnt[2] as sum(current_dp) =15. So why in the previous code's example, the code computed it as 35?

Ah, I see the mistake. The code in the previous example had:

For x=2, the current_dp is computed as the prefix sum of the previous_dp (which is [1,1,1,1,1]).

So the current_dp is [1, 2, 3,4,5]. Sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15.

So cnt[2] is 15. So the code's contribution for x=2 is 15 *1=15.

So the total_full is 10+15=25, which matches the sample.

So why did the code's initial analysis in sample 2 compute cnt[2] as 35? Because I made a mistake.

So the code is correct.

So the code's calculation for the sample input 2 would be:

total_full =10 (x=1) +15 (x=2) =25.

contribution_partial is 0.

So the answer is 25, which matches the sample.

Thus, the code is correct.

Another edge case to consider: when the partial block exists, but the starting t is negative. For example, m_full=1 and x=3. Then m_full +1 =2, x=3 exceeds m_full+1=2. So no contribution.

Thus, the code handles this.

Finally, the code must be written to handle all these cases.

Now, the code with these steps:

But there's a small mistake in the code for the cnt array. For x=1, the code adds sum(dp[0]). dp[0] is [1,1,1,1,1], sum is5 → cnt[1] =5.

But in the code:

for x in range(1, k+1):

   if x ==1:

       cnt[1] = sum(dp[0]) % MOD

   else:

       cnt[x] = sum(dp[x-1]) % MOD

Yes.
