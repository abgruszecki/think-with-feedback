Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to remove up to k road signs to minimize the total travel time. The signs are along a road, each setting a speed limit that applies until the next sign. So removing signs can potentially make the journey faster by allowing us to have longer stretches of lower speed limits. But how do we model this optimally?

First, let's understand the input. The first sign is at 0, which we can't remove. The others are in increasing order. For each sign that's kept, the time added is (distance from next sign - current sign's position) multiplied by the current sign's a_i. So the total time is the sum over all consecutive pairs of signs (d[i+1] - d[i]) * a[i].

If we can remove up to k signs (excluding the first), we need to choose which ones to remove to minimize the total time. The key here is that removing a sign allows the previous sign's speed to apply for a longer stretch. So, for example, if there's a slow sign followed by a faster one, removing the faster one's sign would mean we stay at the slow speed longer, which is worse. But if there's a fast sign followed by a slow one, maybe removing the slow one could help. Wait, no. Because the first sign's speed applies until the next sign. So, if you have a fast sign, followed by a slower one, removing the slower one's sign would make the fast speed apply for a longer stretch. Which is better. So the goal is to eliminate signs that are causing us to switch to higher a_i values as soon as possible.

But how do we model this? Since we can remove up to k signs, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is suitable here. Let's think about DP.

Let's consider the signs in order. For each position i in the signs (after the first), we can decide whether to keep it or remove it, provided we don't exceed the allowed k removals.

Wait, but the signs are in a sequence. So for dynamic programming, perhaps the state can be dp[i][j], which represents the minimum time when considering the first i signs (0-based?), and having removed j signs so far. Then, for each new sign, we can decide whether to keep it or remove it.

But how to model the transitions? Let's think:

Suppose we have a list of signs sorted by their position. The first is always kept. For each i-th sign (starting from 0), and j possible removed signs, we can track the last kept sign. Because the time between the last kept sign and the current one depends on the a value of the last kept sign.

Wait, right. Because if the current sign is kept, then the time added is (d[i] - d[last]) * a[last], where last is the index of the previously kept sign. So the DP state needs to track the last kept sign's index. Hmm, but that would make the state O(n * k * n), since for each i and j, we could have multiple possible 'last' values. That's O(n^2 *k) which could be manageable if n is 500 and k is 500. 500^3 is 125 million. But maybe that's a bit tight for Python, but perhaps manageable with optimizations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP as follows: dp[i][j] represents the minimal time to reach the i-th sign (after possibly removing some signs) with j signs removed, and the i-th sign is kept. Then, for each i, and for each possible j, we can look back to some previous position m (m < i), and if between m and i, there are (i - m - 1) signs that can be removed. So for each i, we can look back to all possible m < i where (i - m - 1) <= j, and compute the minimal time by adding the time from m to i, and the number of removed signs so far is j - (i - m - 1). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think: if there are m and i, and between them are (i - m - 1) signs. So if we choose to keep m and i, then all the signs between m and i can be removed. So for each i and j, we can consider all possible m such that (i - m -1) <= (j - s), where s is the number of signs removed up to m. Wait, maybe it's better to model the transitions as follows.

For each i (current sign kept), and j (number of signs removed up to and including this step), we can look for m in 0 to i-1. The number of signs removed when jumping from m to i is (i - m - 1), since between m and i there are (i - m - 1) signs. So when considering m, the previous state would be dp[m][j - (i - m - 1)], which requires that j >= (i - m -1). Then, the time added would be (d[i] - d[m]) * a[m]. So the transition would be:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m][j - (i - m -1)] + (d[i] - d[m]) * a[m])

But the base case is dp[0][0] = 0, since the first sign is kept and no time has been accumulated yet. Then, after processing all possible signs, we have to consider the final segment from the last kept sign to the end (Olymp City at l). So after considering all the kept signs, the last one's a is multiplied by (l - d[last]).

So the overall steps would be:

1. Compute the initial DP table where dp[i][j] is the minimal time to reach the i-th sign (kept) with j signs removed so far.

2. For each i from 1 to n-1 (since the first is 0 and must be kept), and for each possible j up to k, check all possible m < i where the number of signs between m and i is (i - m -1) and this number must be <= j. Then, compute the new dp[i][j] as the minimum of previous possibilities plus the time from m to i.

3. After building the DP table, for each possible state (i, j) where j <=k, calculate the time from d[i] to l (the end) multiplied by a[i], and add that to dp[i][j]. The minimum of all these possible values (after adding the final segment) is the answer.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the end is at l, which may not be covered by the signs. So the last segment is from the last kept sign's position to l. So for any kept sign at position i (d[i]), the time added is (l - d[i]) * a[i]. So after processing all possible kept signs, we have to account for that.

So the approach would be:

- Compute the DP table for the kept signs, then for each possible state (i, j) where j is the number of signs removed (can't exceed k), compute the total time as dp[i][j] + (l - d[i]) * a[i]. The minimal among all such possibilities (with j + (number of signs removed after i) <=k) is our answer.

Wait, no. Because after the last kept sign i, there are (n-1 - i) signs after it. If we remove all of them, then the last kept sign is i, and the time is (l - d[i]) * a[i]. The number of signs removed after i is (n-1 - i). Because the total number of signs after i (including i+1 to n-1) is (n-1 -i). So the total signs removed would be j (from the DP) plus (n-1 -i), but we need that j + (n-1 -i) <=k.

So for each state (i, j), the maximum allowed is j + (n-1 -i) <=k. Because in the DP, j is the number of signs removed up to and including i. The signs after i can all be removed, which adds (n-1 -i) to j, and that total must be <=k.

So the steps would be:

- For each i in 0..n-1, and j in 0..k:

   if j + (n-1 -i) <=k:

       compute total_time = dp[i][j] + (l -d[i])*a[i]

   keep the minimum of all such total_time.

So the DP must track all possible i and j where after removing up to k signs, including the ones after i.

Now, let's model the DP.

The initial state is dp[0][0] = 0. The first sign is kept.

For each i in 1 to n-1 (since the first sign is 0 and kept), we need to consider all possible m < i, where the number of signs between m and i is (i -m -1). So when moving from m to i, we can remove those (i -m -1) signs, which costs (i -m -1) removals. So for j in 0..k:

   for each possible m < i:

       required_removals = i - m -1

       if j >= required_removals:

           then dp[i][j] could be updated by dp[m][j - required_removals] + (d[i] -d[m]) *a[m]

But for each i and j, we have to check all possible m, which would take O(n^2 *k) time. With n=500 and k=500, that's 500*500*500 = 125,000,000 operations, which in Python is manageable, but perhaps tight. But let's see.

Additionally, the DP array can be represented as a 2D array, where for each i and j, we track the minimum possible time.

Let's outline the steps:

Initialize a DP table with dimensions (n) x (k+1). All entries are initialized to infinity, except dp[0][0] =0.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

   for each possible j_prev in 0..k:

       for each m in 0..i-1:

           required = (i - m -1)

           if j_prev + required >k:

               continue

           current_j = j_prev + required

           time = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

           if time < dp[i][current_j]:

               dp[i][current_j] = time

Wait, no. Wait, when moving from m to i, we remove the (i -m -1) signs between them. So for each m < i, the number of signs removed in this step is (i -m -1). So the previous state must have j_prev, and then the new j is j_prev + (i -m -1). So for each i, j_prev can be up to (current j) - (i -m -1). So perhaps the code would look like:

for i in 1..n-1:

   for m in 0..i-1:

       required = i - m -1

       for j_prev in 0..k - required:

           if dp[m][j_prev] is not infinity:

               new_j = j_prev + required

               new_time = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

               if new_time < dp[i][new_j]:

                   dp[i][new_j] = new_time

But this approach requires for each i, m, and j_prev, which is O(n^3) time. For n=500, that's 500^3 = 125,000,000 operations. In Python, that's going to be way too slow. Because each loop iteration in Python is expensive, and 1e8 operations would take a few seconds. But 1e8 is 100 million, which would be a problem for a 3-second time limit.

So this approach may not be feasible. Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Alternative approach: find that the problem is similar to the problem where you can remove up to k elements from a sequence to minimize some cost. For such problems, dynamic programming with O(nk) time is possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let's think again. The DP state is dp[i][j] representing the minimal time when the last kept sign is the i-th one, and we have removed j signs so far.

Then, for each i, and j, we can consider all previous m such that m < i, and the number of signs removed between m and i is (i -m -1). So for each i, j, we can iterate over all possible m where (i -m -1) <= j. Then, the previous j_prev is j - (i -m -1). So the transition is:

dp[i][j] = min_{m < i} (dp[m][j - (i - m -1)] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m])

The key is that for each i and j, we need to check all m < i, and compute the required j_prev as j - (i -m -1). So for each i and j, the possible m's are those where j_prev >=0, i.e., j - (i -m -1) >=0 → m >= (i - (j +1) -1) ??? Not sure, but in code, for each i and j, iterate m from 0 to i-1, and check if (i -m -1) <= j.

But for each i and j, m can be from 0 to i-1. So the total operations would be O(n^2 *k). Because for each i (n), j (k), and m (up to i-1). But if we loop i from 1 to n-1, j from 0 to k, and m from 0 to i-1, then the total is O(n^2 *k). For n=500, k=500, that's 500*500*500 = 125 million. Which is manageable in C++ but might be challenging in Python.

Hmm. So perhaps we can find a way to optimize this. Let's think: for each i and j, the possible m is up to i-1, but perhaps we can precompute some ranges or find a way to compute transitions more efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each i and j, the best m in O(1) or O(n) time. But I'm not sure.

Let's think about the constraints again. The problem allows n up to 500, k up to 500. So for a DP table of size 500*501 = 250,500 entries, and each entry requires considering up to 500 previous entries, that's 500*500*500 = 125 million operations. In Python, even with 1e8 operations, it's about a second, but 1e8 is 100 million. Wait, 125 million is 1.25e8. Let's say each loop iteration is a few operations. For example, in Python, each loop iteration may take around 10 nanoseconds (very rough estimate), but in reality, loops in Python are much slower. For example, a for loop in Python can take about 0.1 nanoseconds per iteration in C terms, but in Python, it's more like 10-100 times slower. So 1e8 operations could take around 10 seconds. Which is way over the time limit.

So we need a more optimized approach.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model the DP with O(nk) time. Let's think: for each position i, and number of removed signs up to j, can we find the best m in a way that reduces the time?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the problem where you select a subset of signs with at least (n -k) signs (since you can remove up to k), and the first sign is included. The goal is to select the subset that gives the minimal total time. But how to model that?

But even then, how to model the transitions between the selected signs?

Another approach: when building the subset of signs that are kept (must include the first one), the time is determined by the sum of (d_i -d_prev) * a_prev for consecutive signs. So the problem is to choose a subset of signs (including the first and possibly the last, but not necessarily) such that the number of removed signs is at most k. Then, the minimal total time is the sum of the intervals between consecutive kept signs, multiplied by the a of the earlier sign, plus the final segment from the last kept sign to l.

So the problem reduces to selecting a subset of signs where the first is kept, and the number of removed signs is up to k, such that the sum is minimized.

This is similar to the problem of selecting a subset of points with certain constraints to minimize a cost function, which can be approached with dynamic programming.

So the DP[i][j] represents the minimal time when the i-th sign is the last kept one, and j signs have been removed up to i. Then, the transitions are as before.

But with n=500 and k=500, the O(n^2k) approach is O(500^3) which is 125 million operations. So in Python, perhaps with some optimizations, it could pass. Let's think: in Python, a 3D loop of 500*500*500 would take about 125 million steps. Each step involves a few operations, but in Python, even with 100 million steps, it's going to take longer than the 3 seconds allowed. So perhaps this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: note that the transitions for j can be optimized. For each i, when considering j, we can iterate over possible m and required j_prev = j - (i -m -1). But maybe we can precompute for each i and j, the best possible m up to i-1.

Alternatively, for each i, the j can be up to k. And for each i and j, the possible m can be from 0 to i-1, but perhaps for a given i and j, the best m is the one that gives the minimal dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m], where j_prev = j - (i -m -1). But how?

Wait, the term (d[i] -d[m])*a[m] can be rewritten as d[i] *a[m] -d[m] *a[m]. So for each m, the contribution to the new DP[i][j] is (d[i] * a[m] - d[m] *a[m]) + dp[m][j_prev].

But j_prev = j - (i -m -1) → j_prev = j - i + m +1.

So for each i and j, we can express j_prev as j -i +m +1. So for each m, the required j_prev is j_prev = j -i +m +1. And this j_prev must be >=0 and <=k.

So for each i and j, the possible m's must satisfy:

0 <= m < i

and j_prev = j - (i -m -1) = j -i +m +1 >=0 → m >= i - j -1.

Also, since m <i, we have m can be in [max(0, i-j-1), i-1].

Wait, but j_prev can't exceed the possible j values. So j_prev must be <=k.

So for each i and j, the valid m's are those where:

m >= (i - j_prev -1) ??? Not sure. Let me re-express:

We have j_prev = j - (i -m -1). So m = i - (j - j_prev) -1. But perhaps it's easier to loop over m in 0..i-1 and check if j_prev is >=0 and <=k.

But for each i and j, the m can be from 0 to i-1, and j_prev must be >=0 and <=k. So for each m in 0..i-1, compute j_prev = j - (i - m -1). If j_prev is >=0 and <=k, then m is a candidate.

But this approach requires checking all m for each i and j. Which brings us back to O(n^2k) time.

Alternative idea: precompute for each m and j_prev, the best way to reach m with j_prev removals, and then for each i, j_prev can be j - (i -m -1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, can we precompute for each m, the possible transitions to i >m, and for each j_prev, calculate the new j and update accordingly. But I don't see a way to do this.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be solved with a different DP state. For example, let's model the problem by considering that when processing the i-th sign (must be kept), the number of signs removed before i is j. Then, for each i, j, the previous sign must be some m <i, and between m and i, there are (i -m -1) signs which are removed. So j must be at least (i -m -1) plus the j_prev from m.

Wait, no. The j in the state for i is the total number of signs removed up to and including i. So when moving from m to i, the number of signs removed in this step is (i -m -1). So the j for i is j_prev (the number of signs removed up to m) plus (i -m -1).

So j_prev = j - (i -m -1). So for each i and j, the possible m's are those where j_prev >=0 and j_prev <=k.

Thus, for each i and j, m can be in 0..i-1, and (i -m -1) <=j.

But again, this approach leads to O(n^2k) operations.

So perhaps in Python, even with 125 million operations, it's possible if we use some optimizations like using lists and precomputing things.

Another observation: the signs are sorted in increasing order of d_i, which is given. So no need to sort them.

So, perhaps proceed with the DP approach.

Let me outline the steps again:

Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimal time to reach the i-th sign (kept) with j signs removed up to and including i. The initial state is dp[0][0] =0. All others are infinity.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

   for j in 0..k:

       for m from 0 to i-1:

           required = i -m -1

           if required > j: continue

           j_prev = j - required

           if dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m]) * a[m] < dp[i][j]:

               dp[i][j] = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

So for each i, j, and m, this is O(n^3k) which is not feasible.

Wait, no. Wait, the code above is for each i in 1..n-1, and for each j in 0..k, and for each m in 0..i-1, which is O(n^3 k). Wait, but for each i, j ranges up to k, and m up to i-1. So for each i, it's O(k * i) operations. For n=500, sum i from 1 to 499 is about (500^2)/2 = 125,000. Multiply by k=500: 125,000 *500 = 62,500,000 operations. Which is 62.5 million. That's manageable, but in Python, each loop iteration is expensive. So 62 million steps could take longer than 3 seconds.

But perhaps in practice, with some optimizations, it can work. Let's think about the code.

We can precompute the list of d and a. Then, for the DP, we can use a list of lists, perhaps using a 2D array where each row is i, and each column is j.

In Python, using a list of lists for dp, with each row initialized to a large value (like INF = 1e18), and then updating the values as we go.

So code steps:

Read n, l, k.

Read d as a list of integers.

Read a as a list of integers.

Add a dummy sign at the end with d = l and a = 0, but wait, no. Because the last segment is from the last kept sign to l. So the code has to handle that.

But the input has n signs, with d[0] =0, and d[i] <d[i+1]. So after processing all signs, the last segment is from the last kept sign's d[i] to l.

So the code would proceed as:

Initialize dp = [[inf]*(k+1) for _ in range(n)]

dp[0][0] =0

for i in 1..n-1:

    for m in 0..i-1:

        required = i -m -1

        for j_prev in 0..k:

            if j_prev + required >k:

                continue

            current_j = j_prev + required

            if dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m] < dp[i][current_j]:

                dp[i][current_j] = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

But no, the loops are ordered differently. The correct order is for each i, then for each m <i, then for j_prev, compute current_j = j_prev + required, and update dp[i][current_j].

But this way, for each i and m, required is fixed. So for each i, m, required = i -m -1. Then, for each possible j_prev in 0..k:

   if current_j = j_prev + required <=k:

       update dp[i][current_j] with the value from dp[m][j_prev] plus the time between m and i.

This way, the code is:

for i in range(1, n):

    for m in range(i):

        required = i - m -1

        for j_prev in range(k+1):

            if j_prev + required >k:

                continue

            if dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m] < dp[i][j_prev + required]:

                dp[i][j_prev + required] = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

But this is again O(n^3 k) time. For n=500, that's 500 *500 *500 = 125 million operations. Which may be too slow.

Alternative approach: for each m and j_prev, precompute the transitions to i and j where i >m and j = j_prev + (i -m -1) <=k. But I don't see how to optimize this.

Alternatively, note that for a given m and j_prev, the j that can be updated is j_prev + (i -m -1), and i can be any index after m. But not sure.

Alternative idea: perhaps we can precompute for each possible m and j_prev, the maximum i that can be reached given j_prev + (i -m -1) <=k. But this may not be helpful.

Alternatively, for each m, j_prev, the maximum i is m + (k -j_prev) +1. Because i -m -1 <=k -j_prev → i <=m + (k -j_prev) +1. So for each m and j_prev, iterate i from m+1 to m + (k -j_prev) +1. But this again may not reduce the total operations.

Hmm. Let's think of the example. Suppose m=0, j_prev=0. Then required for i=1 is 0 (i=1: m=0, required=0). So current_j=0+0=0. For i=2, required=2-0-1=1. So current_j=0+1=1. For i=3, required=3-0-1=2, current_j=0+2=2. And so on. So for each m and j_prev, the maximum i is m + (k - j_prev) +1. So for each m and j_prev, the possible i's are m+1 to m + (k -j_prev) +1. But how does this affect the total number of operations?

Well, for each m and j_prev, the number of i's is (k -j_prev) +1. So if k is 500, then for each m and j_prev, up to 500+1 steps. But since m can be up to 500 and j_prev up to 500, that's 500*500*(500) = 125 million again. So no gain.

Thus, perhaps there's no way around this and the O(n^2k) approach is the only way. Let's proceed with implementing this and see if we can optimize.

Another observation: the a array is given, and for each transition from m to i, the time added is (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]. So for each m, the a[m] is fixed. So for each i, the term (d[i] -d[m])*a[m] can be computed as a[m] * (d[i] -d[m]).

But how to compute this quickly. Well, no way to precompute here. So each term has to be calculated on the fly.

But perhaps for each i and m, the term is a[m]*(d[i] -d[m]). So precomputing all possible (d[i] -d[m]) for i and m, but for n=500, that's 500*500=250,000 entries, which is manageable. But in Python, even with a 2D list, it's possible.

But I'm not sure if that's worth the precomputation. Maybe not.

So the code outline is:

Read n, l, k.

Read d as list.

Read a as list.

Compute the DP table.

Then, for each possible state (i, j), where j + (n-1 -i) <=k (since after i, we can remove all (n-1 -i) signs), compute the total time as dp[i][j] + (l -d[i])*a[i]. Find the minimal such value.

So the steps:

Initialize dp as 2D array with INF.

Set dp[0][0] =0.

For each i in 1 to n-1:

   for m in 0 to i-1:

       required = i - m -1

       for j_prev in 0 to k:

           if j_prev + required >k:

               continue

           current_j = j_prev + required

           candidate = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m]) * a[m]

           if candidate < dp[i][current_j]:

               dp[i][current_j] = candidate

Then, for the answer:

ans = INF

for i in 0 to n-1:

   for j in 0 to k:

       if j + (n-1 -i) <=k:

           total = dp[i][j] + (l -d[i]) *a[i]

           ans = min(ans, total)

return ans

But the initial code will have to handle the DP transitions.

But in Python, nested loops can be slow. So perhaps using arrays of arrays and precomputing the required steps can help. Let's see.

Implementing this in Python:

We can use a list of lists for dp. Initially, each dp[i][j] is set to a very large value (like 1e18). Then, for each i, m, j_prev, we check if the new value is better.

But in Python, for better performance, perhaps preallocate the list and use loops that are as efficient as possible.

Now, let's test with the first example:

Input:

4 10 0

0 3 4 8

5 8 3 6

In this case, k=0. So we can't remove any signs. The DP for i=1 (second sign) would have required = 1-0-1=0. So j_prev must be 0. So current_j=0. The time added is (3-0)*5=15. So dp[1][0] =15.

For i=2 (third sign), m can be 0 or 1. But required for m=0 is 2-0-1=1. j_prev must be 0. current_j=1. So since k=0, this is invalid. So only m=1 can be considered. required=2-1-1=0. j_prev=0. current_j=0. The time added is (4-3)*8=8. So dp[2][0] =15+8=23.

For i=3 (fourth sign), m can be 0,1,2.

m=0: required=3-0-1=2. j_prev=0 → current_j=2>0 → invalid.

m=1: required=3-1-1=1. j_prev=0 → current_j=1>0 → invalid.

m=2: required=3-2-1=0. j_prev=0 → current_j=0. time added is (8-4)*3=12. dp[3][0] =23+12=35.

Then, the final segment is (10-8)*6=12. So total time 35+12=47.

Which matches the first example.

The second example:

4 10 2

0 3 4 8

5 8 3 6

We can remove up to 2 signs. The optimal is to remove signs at 3 and 8.

So the kept signs are 0 and 4 (third sign). Then, the time between 0 and 4 is (4-0)*5=20. The final segment is (10-4)*3=18. Total 38.

But according to the DP approach:

Let's see.

For i=3 (fourth sign), m can be 0,1,2.

But when considering m=0 and required=3-0-1=2. j_prev can be up to 0 (since j_prev+2 <=k=2). So j_prev=0 → current_j=2. So the candidate is (8-0)*5=40 → dp[3][2] =40. Which is possible.

Then, when considering m=2 and j_prev=0:

required=0. current_j=0. So the time added is (8-4)*3=12 → dp[3][0] =35.

But when i=3 and j=2 (allowed), the time is 40. Then, the final segment is (10-8)*6=12 → total 52. But the optimal solution is to remove two signs. So perhaps the DP approach would find the case where i=2 (third sign) with j=1 (since to get to i=2, m=0 and required=2-0-1=1. j_prev=0 → current_j=1. time is (4-0)*5=20. Then, after i=2, we can remove the remaining 1 sign (since n-1 -i =4-1 -2=1 → j=1+1=2, which is <=k=2). So the final segment is (10-4)*3=18. total is 20+18=38. So in the code, for i=2 and j=1, the time is 20, then adding (10-4)*3=18 gives 38. So in the DP for i=2, j=1: how is that achieved?

Let's see:

For i=2, m can be 0 or 1.

For m=0, required=2-0-1=1. j_prev must be 0. current_j=0+1=1. So candidate is (4-0)*5=20. So dp[2][1] =20.

For m=1, required=2-1-1=0. j_prev can be 1, but initially dp[1][j_prev] may not have been set. For example, when i=1 (sign at 3), j_prev=0, required=0 → j=0. So dp[1][0] =15. Then, for m=1 and j_prev=1 (but j_prev can't be 1 because we can't have j_prev=1 when m=1, since j_prev is up to 0 for m=1 (since m=1 is i=1, and in that case, for j_prev up to k). So perhaps, the code would have dp[2][1] =20.

Then, when considering the answer, for i=2 and j=1, we can remove the remaining 4-1 -2 =1 (n-1 -i=4-1 -2=1 (since n is 4, indices are 0,1,2,3). So j=1 and n-1 -i=3-2=1. So 1+1=2 <=k=2. So the total time is 20 + (10-4)*3=20+18=38.

Thus, the code would find this case.

So the code works.

Thus, the approach seems correct.

Now, the code implementation in Python.

But how to handle the DP in Python efficiently.

In Python, using a list of lists for dp, initialized with infinity. Then, for each i, m, j_prev, calculate the current_j and update dp[i][current_j] if possible.

But for large n and k, this can be slow. So to optimize, perhaps using for each i, precompute the possible m and j_prev.

But perhaps we can use a 2D array for dp, and for each step, iterate m from 0 to i-1, and for each m, compute required = i -m -1. Then, for each j_prev in 0 to k:

   if j_prev + required >k → skip.

   current_j = j_prev + required.

   if dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m] < dp[i][current_j], then update.

But in Python, nested loops are slow. So perhaps we can find a way to vectorize some operations or use precomputed ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps using a 1D array for each row. For example, for each i, maintain a current row, and for each m, iterate through j_prev and update the current row.

But not sure.

Alternatively, use a list of lists and loop in a way that minimizes the number of operations.

Now, code steps:

Read n, l, k.

Read d list.

Read a list.

Compute the DP:

n is up to 500. So create a dp array of size n x (k+1), initialized to infinity.

INF = 1e18.

dp = [[INF]*(k+1) for _ in range(n)]

dp[0][0] =0

for i in range(1, n):

    for m in range(i):

        required = i - m -1

        for j_prev in range(k+1):

            if j_prev + required >k:

                continue

            if dp[m][j_prev] == INF:

                continue

            current_j = j_prev + required

            time_candidate = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] - d[m]) * a[m]

            if time_candidate < dp[i][current_j]:

                dp[i][current_j] = time_candidate

But this loops over i from 1 to n-1, m from 0 to i-1, j_prev from 0 to k. Which is O(n^2k) operations.

But with n=500 and k=500, this is 500*500*500=125 million steps. In Python, this is too slow.

Hmm. So, how to optimize this?

Alternative idea: for each m, j_prev, precompute all possible i that can be reached by removing the required number of signs between m and i. But this may not help.

Alternative approach: reverse the loops. For each m and j_prev, precompute the possible i and current_j.

For example:

for m in range(n):

    for j_prev in range(k+1):

        if dp[m][j_prev] == INF:

            continue

        # For this m and j_prev, find all possible i >m.

        # The required for i is i -m -1.

        # current_j = j_prev + (i -m -1) <=k

        # So i can be up to m + (k - j_prev) +1.

        max_i = m + (k - j_prev) +1

        max_i = min(max_i, n-1)

        for i in range(m+1, max_i+1):

            required = i -m -1

            current_j = j_prev + required

            if current_j >k:

                continue

            time_candidate = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m]) *a[m]

            if time_candidate < dp[i][current_j]:

                dp[i][current_j] = time_candidate

This way, for each m and j_prev, the code computes the possible i's that can be reached. This way, for each m and j_prev, the code loops through the possible i's.

This approach's complexity is O(n *k * average number of i's per m and j_prev).

But for each m and j_prev, the maximum i is m + (k -j_prev) +1.

But the total number of i's per m and j_prev is (k -j_prev) +1. So the average number of i's per m and j_prev is O(k).

Thus, the total complexity is O(n *k *k), which for n=500 and k=500 is 500*500*500 = 125 million again.

So no gain.

But perhaps this approach is faster in practice because it skips some steps.

Another optimization: precompute all possible (m, i) pairs where i can be reached from m with required signs removed, and j_prev is such that j_prev + required <=k.

But this may not help.

Alternative idea: for each m, compute for all possible i >=m+1, and for each i, compute required = i-m-1. Then, the j_prev can vary from 0 to k - required. For each such j_prev, update dp[i][j_prev + required].

But this would again be O(n^2 *k) operations.

Hmm. So, perhaps the code can be written in a way that iterates m from 0 to i-1, and for each m, required = i -m -1. Then, for j_prev in 0 to k - required:

   current_j = j_prev + required

   update dp[i][current_j] = min(dp[i][current_j], dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i]-d[m])*a[m])

But in this case, for each i and m, the j_prev can be up to k - required.

So the code would look like:

for i in 1 to n-1:

    for m in 0 to i-1:

        required = i -m -1

        max_j_prev = k - required

        if max_j_prev <0:

            continue

        for j_prev in 0 to max_j_prev:

            if dp[m][j_prev] is not INF:

                current_j = j_prev + required

                time_candidate = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

                if time_candidate < dp[i][current_j]:

                    dp[i][current_j] = time_candidate

This way, for each i and m, j_prev ranges from 0 to (k - required), which can be less than k.

But for cases where required is large, this reduces the number of j_prev steps.

But in the worst case, this is the same as the previous approach.

But perhaps it's slightly better.

Let's see:

In the code:

for i in range(1, n):

    for m in range(i):

        required = i - m -1

        max_j_prev = k - required

        if max_j_prev <0:

            continue

        for j_prev in range(0, max_j_prev +1):

            if dp[m][j_prev] == INF:

                continue

            current_j = j_prev + required

            time_candidate = dp[m][j_prev] + (d[i] -d[m])*a[m]

            if time_candidate < dp[i][current_j]:

                dp[i][current_j] = time_candidate

This code loops over j_prev from 0 to max_j_prev. So for cases where required is large, this loop is shorter. For example, if required is 500, then max_j_prev is k -500. If k=500, then max_j_prev is 0, and j_prev can only be 0.

But for required=0, max_j_prev is k.

Thus, this approach can save some iterations in the inner loop.

So this is a better approach. Let's implement this.

But how to calculate max_j_prev.

So for each i and m, required is computed as i-m-1. Then, max_j_prev = k - required. If required >k, then max_j_prev is negative, so we skip this m.

Thus, this way, for each i and m, we only iterate j_prev up to (k - required), which can be less than k.

This can reduce the number of iterations.

So let's implement this.

In Python, this code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, l, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    d = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

            required = i - m -1

            max_j_prev = k - required

            if max_j_prev <0:

                continue

            for j_prev in range(max_j_prev +1):

                if dp[m][j_prev] == INF:

                    continue

                current_j = j_prev + required

Sample Input 2:

4 10 2

0 3 4 8

5 8 3 6

The code should compute the answer as 38.

Let's see:

In the DP for i=2:

m=0: required=2-0-1=1. max_j_prev=2-1=1. So j_prev can be 0 or 1.

j_prev=0: current_j=1. candidate =0 + (4-0)*5=20 → dp[2][1] =20.

j_prev=1: but dp[0][1] is INF.

Thus, dp[2][1] =20.

Then, for i=3:

possible m's:

m=0: required=3-0-1=2. max_j_prev=2-2=0 → j_prev can be 0.

current_j=0+2=2. candidate=0 + (8-0)*5=40 → dp[3][2] =40.

m=1: required=3-1-1=1. max_j_prev=2-1=1. So j_prev can be 0 or 1.

For j_prev=0: current_j=1. candidate=15 + (8-3)*8=15+40=55 → dp[3][1] is 55.

For j_prev=1: dp[1][1] is INF.

m=2: required=3-2-1=0. max_j_prev=2-0=2. So j_prev can be 0,1,2.

For j_prev=0: current_j=0. candidate=23 + (8-4)*3=23+12=35 → dp[3][0] =35.

j_prev=1: candidate=20 + (8-4)*3=20+12=32 → current_j=1 → dp[3][1] becomes 32.

j_prev=2: dp[2][2] is INF.

So for dp[3][1], the value is 32.

Then, when calculating the answer:

For i=2 and j=1:

j + (3-2) =1+1=2 <=2.

So time is 20 + (10-4)*3=20+18=38.

Which is the correct answer.

So the code works.

Thus, the code should handle the cases correctly.
