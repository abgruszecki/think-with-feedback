Okay, I need to solve this Zuma problem. Let's see what the problem says. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds to remove all gemstones by deleting palindromic substrings each time. Each second, you can remove one palindromic substring. So, I have to find the optimal sequence of removals to minimize the steps.

Let's think about the examples. The first example is [1,2,1], which is a palindrome itself. So you can remove it all in one step. That's straightforward. The second example is three different colors. Each is a palindrome of length 1, so you have to remove them one by one, three steps. The third example shows that sometimes grouping even non-consecutive palindromes after some steps can help. Like removing the two 4s first allows the remaining parts to form a longer palindrome.

Hmm. So this seems like a dynamic programming problem. Because the problem involves making choices (which palindrome to remove first) and the optimal solution for a subarray can be built from smaller subarrays. The key is to model the transitions correctly.

The constraints are n up to 500. So a DP approach with O(n^3) time complexity might be feasible. Let's think about how to model this.

Let's consider a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps to remove the subarray from index i to j (inclusive). The base case would be when i > j (empty array, 0 steps), and when i == j (single element, 1 step).

For the transitions, if the first and last elements are the same, maybe we can combine the steps. For example, if we have a subarray like a ... a, then the steps could be the steps to remove the middle part plus maybe some optimization. Or, maybe there's a scenario where removing some inner palindromic part allows the outer parts to merge.

Another approach is to consider that when you have the same elements at the ends, you might not need to add a step. For example, if the entire subarray i+1 to j-1 is removed in k steps, then the outer a's can be removed in the same step as the last step of the inner removal. Wait, but how does that work? Because the palindrome can be extended. Like, if you have a sequence like a b a. Then removing the middle b (step 1) leaves a a, which can be removed in step 1 as well, but in this case, the entire sequence is a palindrome, so you can remove it in one step. Hmm, but that's a case where the ends are same and the middle can be removed in a way that allows the entire thing to be a palindrome.

Alternatively, the recurrence might be:

If c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1]) but only if the inner part can be merged. But that's not sufficient. For example, if the inner part takes k steps, maybe the outer a's can be merged into one of those steps. For example, consider the subarray a x x a. If the inner xx is removed in one step, then the remaining a and a form a palindrome of length 2. So the total steps would be 2. But the entire a x x a is a palindrome, so removing it in one step is possible. So the DP needs to account for that.

Wait, but in that case, the minimal steps for the a x x a would be 1. So the DP should find that. So the approach is, if the first and last elements are same, then check if the inner part can be merged in such a way that the outer elements are part of the same step.

Alternatively, the recurrence could be:

For each i <= k < j, split the subarray into i..k and k+1..j. Then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j], ...). But also, if c[i] == c[j], then maybe there's a better way by combining the two parts.

So the standard approach for such DP is to consider all possible splits and take the minimum. But for n=500, the DP would be O(n^3), which is 500^3 = 125 million operations. That's manageable within 2 seconds, as each step is simple.

But maybe there are optimizations. Let's outline the possible transitions:

The DP[i][j] can be computed as follows:

- If i == j: 1.

- Else if c[i] == c[j]:

   - If j == i+1: then it's a palindrome of length 2, so 1 step.

   - Else: check if the inner part (i+1 to j-1) can be removed in steps, and then the outer two can be part of that. For example, if the inner part is removed in k steps, then the entire i..j can be removed in k steps if the inner step's last removal allows the outer a's to form a palindrome. But how to model that?

Alternatively, dp[i][j] could be min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], ...) but I'm not sure.

Another idea is that when c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] can be dp[i][j-1] or dp[i+1][j], because adding the same character as the end might allow merging. For example, if you have a ... a, then if the inner part can be removed in k steps, then adding the outer a's can be merged into one of the steps. But how?

Alternatively, the minimal steps could be the same as the steps for the inner part. For example, if the inner i+1..j-1 requires m steps, then the entire i..j can be done in m steps. But only if the inner steps allow the outer a's to form a palindrome. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, when c[i] == c[k], for some k in i..j, then maybe splitting into i..k and k+1..j, and see if the colors can be merged. But that's again not straightforward.

This seems tricky. Let's look for similar problems. This problem resembles the classic "minimum number of palindromic substrings to partition the string" but that's different. Or, it's similar to the problem of finding the minimum number of palindromic substrings to cover the string. But in this case, each step removes a substring, which may allow the remaining parts to form new palindromes.

But in our problem, each step removes a substring, and the remaining parts are concatenated. So the order of removals affects the structure. However, the problem allows us to choose any palindromic substring each time. So, the optimal approach is to find a sequence where each step removes as much as possible, leveraging palindromes formed by previous removals.

But modeling the DP to account for this is challenging.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows: the DP[i][j] represents the minimum steps to remove the gemstones from i to j. For the transitions:

Case 1: If the first element is removed alone. Then the steps are 1 + DP[i+1][j].

Case 2: If the last element is removed alone. Then steps are 1 + DP[i][j-1].

Case 3: Find a k in i to j-1, and split into i..k and k+1..j. Then steps are DP[i][k] + DP[k+1][j].

Case 4: If c[i] == c[j], then perhaps the steps can be minimized by considering the possibility of combining. For example, if the entire segment i..j is removed in one step if it's a palindrome. Or, if we can merge steps by using the same color at the ends.

Wait, but how? Let's think. Suppose the subarray i..j has c[i] = c[j]. Then, if we first remove a palindrome in the middle, then the remaining parts might form a new palindrome. For example, in the third sample input:

1 4 4 2 3 2 1

If we first remove the two 4's (positions 2 and 3), then the remaining array is 1,2,3,2,1, which is a palindrome. So the steps are 2.

So the DP[i][j] for the entire array can be DP[i][k] + DP[k+1][j], but if after removing some parts, the remaining parts can form a palindrome that allows combining steps.

But how to model this in the DP? Because the order in which you remove the palindromes affects the structure of the array. But the DP approach would not track the order of removals, which could lead to incorrect transitions. However, perhaps the DP can still work because it's considering all possible splits and the minimal steps, regardless of the order.

Wait, the DP approach for such interval problems usually works when the order of processing the subsegments can be considered independent, as long as the transitions are correct.

Let's think again. For the general case of DP[i][j], when i < j and c[i] == c[k] for some k in i+1..j, then perhaps combining the steps for i..k and k+1..j in a certain way can reduce the steps.

Alternatively, the key idea is that when two ends are the same, the minimal steps could be the same as the steps required for the inner segment. For example, if we have a sequence like a ... a, then the steps for i..j could be the steps for i+1..j-1, because once you remove the inner part, the two a's form a palindrome of length 2, which can be removed in one step. But that step would have been accounted for in the DP[i+1][j-1] steps? Or not?

Wait, let's take an example. Consider the case where the subarray is a x x a. The inner x x is a palindrome and can be removed in one step. Then, the two a's are left, which form a palindrome of two, which can be removed in another step. So total steps are 2. But the entire a x x a is a palindrome, so it can be removed in one step. So the DP[i][j] should be 1, not 2. So the transition that uses the inner steps (i+1, j-1) would have given 1 (since inner x x is removed in one step) plus 1 for the outer a's? But that's 2, which is higher than the optimal 1. So that approach is not correct.

Hmm. So the problem arises because the order in which you remove the palindromes affects the steps. If you remove the inner part first, you need two steps. But if you remove the entire a x x a in one step, it's better.

Thus, the DP must account for the possibility of the entire segment being a palindrome. So, for each segment i..j, if the entire segment is a palindrome, then the answer is 1. But how to check that? It's possible but for longer segments, but it's not feasible to check for every possible i and j whether the segment is a palindrome.

Alternatively, perhaps precompute a 2D array that indicates if a segment i..j is a palindrome. Then, for the DP[i][j], if it's a palindrome, then the answer is 1. Otherwise, proceed as per the transitions.

But even with that, it's possible that combining segments could yield a better result than checking individual palindromes.

Let me outline the DP transitions more clearly.

The initial approach is:

dp[i][j] = minimum steps to remove the segment i..j.

Base cases:

- If i > j: dp[i][j] = 0.

- If i == j: dp[i][j] = 1.

For the transitions:

For i < j:

Option 1: Remove the first character (i) in one step. Then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j].

Option 2: Remove the last character (j) in one step. Then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i][j-1].

Option 3: Split the segment into two parts, i..k and k+1..j, and sum their steps. For all k in i <= k < j. So dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]) for all k.

Option 4: If c[i] == c[j], then perhaps the steps can be reduced. For example, if the inner segment i+1..j-1 is removed in dp[i+1][j-1] steps, then the outer two characters can be merged into one of the steps. Wait, but how? Let's say the inner steps take m steps, then the outer two characters form a palindrome of length 2. So in that case, the total steps would be m + 1. But if the entire segment is a palindrome, then it's 1 step. So in that case, if c[i] == c[j], then perhaps the steps can be min(dp[i+1][j-1], 1 + ...). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's take an example where i and j are the same, but the inner segment is not a palindrome. Like, the segment is a x a. Here, i=0, j=2. The entire segment is a palindrome, so steps are 1. If we split into a and x a (but that's not the case), but the optimal is to remove the entire segment. So the DP must account for this.

Another example: a x y a. The inner segment is x y, which would take 2 steps. Then, the outer a's would form a palindrome of length 2, requiring 1 more step. So total steps 3. But if the entire segment is not a palindrome. So the minimal steps would be 3. But if there's a way to remove a x and then y a, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, if x y can be removed in a way that allows the a's to form a palindrome. But that's not possible here.

So, for the case when c[i] == c[j], perhaps the minimal steps can be min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] where c[k] == c[i], etc.).

Wait, perhaps when c[i] == c[j], we can consider the scenario where after removing some part of the middle, the remaining parts can form a longer palindrome. For instance, if we have a x x a. The entire segment is a palindrome, so 1 step. But if we split into a and x x a, then steps would be 1 (a) + 1 (x x a) = 2. But the optimal is 1. So, the DP transitions must capture that.

So the key is that when the ends are the same, we can look for a position k where c[k] is equal to c[i], and then combine the steps for i..k and k+1..j-1.

Alternatively, here's an alternative approach inspired by the problem of removing all balls with certain conditions:

The DP[i][j] can be computed as follows:

If c[i] == c[j], then:

   dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1]) if the entire segment is a palindrome.

But this is not sufficient. Alternatively, even if the entire segment is not a palindrome, but the ends are the same, perhaps merging steps from the inner part and the outer parts.

Another approach is to check all possible splits where c[i] == c[k], then the steps could be dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k][j], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's a possible transition when c[i] == c[j]:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Wait, no. Let's think. For example, in the case where i and j are the same, then the steps are 1. If j is i+1, then if the two elements are same, steps are 1. If they are different, steps are 2.

So, perhaps for the general case where i < j and c[i] == c[j], the minimal steps can be min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1]). Because maybe the inner part can be removed in some steps and the outer two can be merged into one of those steps.

Alternatively, if c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] could be dp[i+1][j-1] if the inner part's steps allow the outer elements to form a palindrome. But how to model this.

Wait, let's think of a scenario where the inner part i+1 to j-1 is removed in k steps. Then, the outer elements i and j are left. But since they are the same, they form a palindrome and can be removed in one step. So the total steps would be k + 1. But in some cases, maybe there's a way to merge the steps. For example, if the inner steps include a step that allows the outer elements to be part of a larger palindrome. Like in the case where the entire segment is a palindrome.

So, perhaps the correct transition is:

If c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i+1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps when c[i] == c[j] is min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1] + (if the inner is not a palindrome then 0 else 0)). Not sure.

Alternatively, the minimal steps can be found by checking if the ends are same and then looking for a split point k between i and j where c[k] == c[i], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - 1). Because the two parts could share the same color and be merged into one step.

But this is getting complicated.

An alternative idea comes from the problem of minimum number of steps to remove all, which is similar to the problem of burst balloons. But in that case, the order of bursting affects the coins collected. However, in this problem, the order of removals affects the structure of the remaining array, which complicates things. However, the DP approach for interval problems can sometimes work by considering the first or last step taken.

Wait, let's think about the last step. Suppose the last step is to remove a palindrome that starts at i and ends at j. Then the entire segment is removed in one step. Otherwise, the last step could be part of some split.

But the problem is to find the minimal steps. So the DP[i][j] can be considered as the minimal steps where the entire segment i..j is removed by first removing some palindromes and then the last step.

Alternatively, for the interval i..j, the minimal steps could be:

- 1 if the entire interval is a palindrome.

- Otherwise, split into i..k and k+1..j, sum their steps and find the minimum.

But this is not correct. For example, in the third sample, the entire array is not a palindrome. So according to this approach, you split into parts, but the optimal solution involves removing a palindrome in the middle first, which allows the remaining parts to form a palindrome.

But this approach would not consider that. So perhaps the standard DP approach isn't sufficient, and we need a more nuanced transition.

Another possible approach is that when the ends are same, then the steps can be the same as for the inner segment. For example, if i..j's ends are same, then the steps would be dp[i+1][j-1] if the inner steps allow the ends to be merged. But how?

Alternatively, if you have a segment a ... a, then the steps could be:

- If the inner segment can be removed in such a way that the two a's form a palindrome. For example, the inner segment is removed, leaving the two a's, which are a palindrome. So steps would be dp[i+1][j-1] + 1. But if the inner steps already include a step where the two a's are part of a larger palindrome, then the steps could be dp[i+1][j-1].

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, consider that the two a's can be merged with some step in the inner steps. For example, if during the removal of the inner segment, one of the steps is a palindrome that includes either the left or right a. Then, the two a's could be part of that step.

But how to model this in the DP.

An alternative approach is inspired by the following observation: the minimal steps for i..j is at least the minimal steps for i+1..j, but when the first character is merged with some in i+1..j.

Alternatively, here's a possible recurrence:

dp[i][j] = min over all possible k in i..j where c[i] == c[k] of (dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k+1][j])

This would imply that if we can find a k where c[i] == c[k], then after removing the segment from i+1 to k-1 (which takes dp[i+1][k-1] steps), the i and k positions are next to each other (since the middle part is removed). Then, since c[i] == c[k], the remaining segment from i to k can be removed as a palindrome, possibly in a single step, but perhaps combining with the next part.

Wait, perhaps this is the right way. Let's take an example where i=0, j=2, and c[i] = a, c[j] = a. Then, for k=0, it's the same as the first character, but k can be 2. Then, the split would be:

dp[0][2] = min(dp[1][1] (steps to remove the middle) + dp[3][2] (invalid, so 0). So it's 1 + 0 = 1. Which is correct.

Another example: i=0, j=3, with colors a, b, b, a. Then, choosing k=3 (c[3] = a). Then, the split is dp[0+1][3-1] (dp[1][2]) + dp[4][3] (invalid). dp[1][2] is 1 (since it's a palindrome of two b's). So total steps 1 + 0 = 1. Which is correct because the entire a b b a is a palindrome.

So, this recurrence would handle cases where the ends are same and there's a k in the middle that is same, allowing merging.

So the general idea is:

For each i <= j, the minimal steps can be found by:

1. Check if c[i] == c[j], then the steps could be as low as dp[i+1][j-1].

2. Check for all k in i to j where c[k] == c[i], then the steps can be dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k][j].

But how does this work?

Alternatively, the recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]) for all k in i <= k < j.

Additionally, if c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1]).

Wait, but that may not capture all possibilities.

Alternatively, the standard approach for such problems is to use:

Initialize dp[i][j] as dp[i+1][j] + 1 (removing the first character) and dp[i][j-1] + 1 (removing the last character), then check for splits between i and j, and take the minimum.

But then, if the ends are same, also check for the case where removing the inner part and adding the two ends. For example, if c[i] == c[j], then the steps could be min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1]).

But that's not correct in all cases. For example, the case where the inner part can be removed in one step and the outer two can be removed in another step. Then, the total is 2 steps. But if the entire segment is a palindrome, it's 1 step.

So the recurrence could be:

dp[i][j] = min(
    1 + dp[i+1][j],  // remove first character
    1 + dp[i][j-1],  // remove last character
    min over k in [i, j-1] (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]),  // split into two parts
    (if c[i] == c[j]) then dp[i+1][j-1] else infinity
)

But wait, in the case where c[i] == c[j], and the inner part is not a palindrome, then dp[i+1][j-1] might be higher than other options. For example, if the inner part takes m steps, then adding the two ends would require m steps plus something?

Hmm, perhaps not. Let's think of a case where the inner part is a x a, and the outer two are a and a. Then, the entire segment is a a x a a. If the inner a x a can be removed in 1 step, then the remaining two a's can be removed in one step. So total steps would be 2. But the entire segment is a palindrome, so it can be removed in 1 step. So the recurrence must choose the minimal between these options.

So, the transition for c[i] == c[j] is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition is:

If c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] can be min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j], dp[i+1][j-1])

But again, not sure.

An alternative way to model this is to consider that when c[i] == c[j], then the steps required could be the same as for the segment i+1..j or i..j-1. For example, if you have a x a, the steps could be the same as for x (which is 1), but since the entire a x a is a palindrome, it's 1 step. So the recurrence would not capture that.

So perhaps the key is to precompute for all intervals i..j whether the segment is a palindrome. Then, for the DP[i][j], if it's a palindrome, then dp[i][j] is 1. Otherwise, proceed with the other transitions.

But that's not correct either. For example, in the third sample input, the entire array is not a palindrome, but the optimal solution is to remove a palindrome in the middle first. So the DP must consider splits.

But how to model that.

Alternatively, the minimal steps can be found by considering that removing a palindrome from the middle first allows the remaining parts to be merged into a larger palindrome, which can be removed in fewer steps.

But how to model that in the DP.

An alternative approach is to precompute the palindrome structure of the array. Then, for each interval i..j, if it is a palindrome, then dp[i][j] = 1. Otherwise, compute the minimal steps by splitting into two parts.

But for intervals that are not palindromes, the minimal steps can be found by considering splits and also checking if the ends are same and then merging steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct DP transitions are:

For each interval i..j:

If i > j: 0

Else if i == j: 1

Else:

Initialize dp[i][j] to a large value.

If c[i] == c[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])

If c[i] == c[j] and j == i+1, then dp[i][j] = 1

Else:

For all k in i <=k <j:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])

Additionally, check if there exists a k where c[k] == c[i], and see if combining the left and right parts can reduce the steps.

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to use the following DP recurrence:

dp[i][j] = min over all possible splits and the case when ends are same.

So, the code would look something like this:

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if i == j:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            # Initialize to split into i and i+1..j, or j and i..j-1
            dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[i+1][j], 1 + dp[i][j-1])
            # Check if c[i] == c[j], then possibly merge
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                if j == i+1:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])
            # Check all possible splits into i..k and k+1..j
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])

But this approach may not capture all possibilities where removing a palindrome in the middle allows the ends to merge.

For example, in the third sample input, after removing 4 4 (positions 2-3), the remaining array is 1,2,3,2,1. The DP for the entire array (0-6) would have to find that splitting into 0-0 and 1-6 gives 1 + 2 = 3 steps. Splitting into 0-1 and 2-6 gives 2 + 2 =4 steps. But according to the sample, the answer is 2 steps. So the code must find a split where one part is 1-3 (4,4), which takes 1 step, and the other part is 0-0, 4-6 (2,3,2,1) which is not. Wait, perhaps the code needs to find the optimal split for the entire array.

But according to the code, the code considers all possible splits. So in the third sample input, the entire array is 1 4 4 2 3 2 1.

The code would compute for interval 0-6:

Initially, dp[0][6] is min(1 + dp[1][6], 1 + dp[0][5]).

But then, since c[0] == c[6], we check if dp[1][5] is better.

Then, for all splits k between 0 and 6, the code checks each possible split.

But in this case, when k=3, split into 0-3 and 4-6. dp[0][3] would be the steps for the segment 1,4,4,2. Which is 2 steps (remove 4,4 first, then 1 and 2). dp[4][6] is the steps for 3,2,1. Which is 3 steps. So total 2+3=5 steps. Not helpful.

But in reality, the optimal is to remove 4,4 first (steps 1) and then remove the remaining 1,2,3,2,1 (step 1). So the total steps 2. How does the code capture this?

Because the code's dp[0][6] would need to find that the split into 0-6 is possible by first splitting into 1-3 (4,4) and then the remaining parts. But the code doesn't split into arbitrary splits; it only splits into i..k and k+1..j. So in the case of the third sample, after removing 1-3 (4,4) which is part of the array, the code would have to model the steps for the remaining parts.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach will not find this, and thus would not work for the third sample.

So, perhaps the standard DP approach is not sufficient. Let's think again.

The problem with the standard approach is that it doesn't account for the possibility of merging steps when a palindrome is removed from the middle. For example, in the third sample, removing 4,4 (steps 1) allows the remaining array to form a palindrome. The DP approach for the entire array would need to see that.

But how can the DP model this? Because after removing a palindrome from the middle, the left and right parts are merged, which could form a new palindrome. But the DP approach as described earlier doesn't account for this.

Thus, the DP transitions need to consider the scenario where removing a certain part in the middle allows the left and right parts to merge into a palindrome.

But modeling this is challenging. Perhaps the correct approach is to model the DP[i][j] as the minimal steps to remove the segment i..j, and for each i..j, consider not only splitting into two parts but also considering that if some part in the middle is removed first.

But this would require considering all possible splits, which is computationally expensive.

Alternatively, the DP can be modified as follows:

For each interval i..j, the minimal steps can be found by considering that the first step is to remove a palindrome that starts at i and ends at k (for some k >=i). Then, the steps would be 1 (for this removal) plus the steps to remove the remaining parts (i..k-1 and k+1..j). Wait, no. Because removing a substring from i to k would leave the remaining parts as the elements before i and after k. But in the problem, the entire segment i..j is considered, so the removal of a palindrome in i..j would split into two segments: the left part (before the palindrome) and the right part (after the palindrome). But this seems to complicate the transitions.

Alternatively, think of the first step in removing the entire segment i..j as removing a palindrome. Then, the steps would be 1 if the entire segment is a palindrome. Otherwise, the first step removes a palindrome inside the segment, and then the remaining parts are processed. But this approach would require considering all possible palindromic substrings that can be removed first, which is O(n^3) in the worst case.

But given that n is up to 500, O(n^3) might be feasible.

So, the steps for the DP[i][j] would be:

If the entire segment i..j is a palindrome: 1 step.

Otherwise, the minimal steps are the minimal over all possible palindromic substrings s in i..j, then the steps are 1 (remove s) + steps for the remaining parts.

But the remaining parts are not necessarily contiguous. For example, if the palindrome s is in the middle, then the remaining parts would be the left part and the right part.

So, this leads to the following recurrence:

dp[i][j] = 1 + min over all possible splits where s is a palindrome in i..j, and then sum the steps for the left and right parts.

But how to find all possible palindromic substrings s and compute the sum of steps for the remaining parts.

This approach seems computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, the recurrence can be written as:

dp[i][j] = min over all k in i..j and l in k..j, if i..k is a palindrome, then 1 + dp[k+1][j].

But this is not correct. Because after removing i..k, the remaining parts are k+1..j. Then, the steps would be 1 + dp[k+1][j]. But this is similar to the earlier approach where the first step is to remove a palindrome starting at i. But this is not considering all possible palindromes that can be removed in the first step.

Wait, but the first step could remove any palindrome in the segment i..j. For example, in the third sample, the first step removes the palindrome 4,4 (positions 2-3). The remaining segment is 0-1 and 4-6. But the problem is that the remaining segments are split into two parts: 0-1 and 4-6. So the steps after that would be dp[0][1] + dp[4][6]. But in this case, after removing 2-3, the remaining segments are 0-1 and 4-6. So the total steps would be 1 (removing 2-3) + dp[0][1] + dp[4][6].

But in the third sample, dp[0][1] is 2 (remove each of the 1 and 4), and dp[4][6] is 3 (remove 3, then 2, then 1). So the total steps would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is way more than the optimal 2.

But this is incorrect, because after removing 2-3, the remaining array is 1,4,2,3,2,1. Wait, no. The original array is 1 4 4 2 3 2 1. Removing 4,4 (positions 2 and 3) leaves 1,4,2,3,2,1. Which is 6 elements, not split into two parts. So the code's DP approach, which models the entire segment as i..j, must capture that the remaining segment is a single contiguous part. So, after removing a palindrome in the middle, the remaining parts are merged. So, the remaining segment is the part before the removed substring concatenated with the part after.

Thus, when removing a palindrome substring from position k to l (k <= l), the remaining parts are i..k-1 and l+1..j. Thus, the steps would be 1 + dp[i][k-1] + dp[l+1][j].

But considering all possible palindromic substrings in i..j and taking the minimal steps would be O(n^3), which is 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which might be feasible within the time limit.

But how to model this.

The problem is that for each interval i..j, we need to consider all possible palindromic substrings within it, and compute 1 + steps for the remaining parts.

But this approach would require iterating over all possible k and l (start and end of the palindrome) within i..j. For each possible k and l where the substring k..l is a palindrome, compute 1 + dp[i][k-1] + dp[l+1][j]. Then, take the minimal of all these possibilities and compare with the current dp[i][j].

But precomputing all possible palindromic substrings would take O(n^2) time. Then, for each interval i..j, we need to check all possible palindromic substrings within i..j and compute the steps.

This seems computationally heavy, but for n=500, n^3 is 125 million operations, which should be manageable within 2 seconds if the code is optimized.

So the steps to solve the problem would be:

1. Precompute a 2D array is_palindrome[i][j] which is True if the substring i..j is a palindrome.

2. Initialize a DP table of size n x n.

3. Fill the DP table using the following approach:

   For all i from n-1 down to 0:

      For all j from i to n-1:

         If i == j:

             dp[i][j] = 1

         Else:

             dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[i+1][j], 1 + dp[i][j-1])

             if c[i] == c[j]:

                 if j == i+1:

                     current_min = 1

                 else:

                     current_min = dp[i+1][j-1]

                 dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], current_min)

             for k in i to j-1:

                 dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])

             # Now check all possible palindromic substrings in i..j and see if removing any of them gives a better result.

             for k in i to j:

                 for l in k to j:

                     if is_palindrome[k][l]:

                         if k == i and l == j:

                             option = 1

                         else:

                             option = 1

                             if i <= k-1:

                                 option += dp[i][k-1]

                             if l+1 <= j:

                                 option += dp[l+1][j]

                         dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], option)

But this is O(n^4) time, which is 500^4 = 625 billion operations. That's way too much.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So this indicates that considering all possible palindromic substrings for each interval is not feasible. Thus, the standard DP approach must be used with some optimizations.

So, going back to the standard DP approach, let's see why it doesn't work for the third sample.

The third sample's array is [1,4,4,2,3,2,1].

Let's compute the DP table for this case.

For the interval i=0, j=6 (entire array):

The code would first set dp[0][6] to min(1+dp[1][6], 1+dp[0][5]). But what are dp[1][6] and dp[0][5]?

Let's see:

dp[1][6] corresponds to the array [4,4,2,3,2,1]. The minimal steps for this.

Similarly, dp[0][5] is the array [1,4,4,2,3,2]. The minimal steps for that.

But the code would then check if c[0] == c[6], which they are (both 1). So then, it would consider dp[1][5], which is the steps for [4,4,2,3,2].

What's the minimal steps for [4,4,2,3,2]?

The optimal steps here would be 2: remove 4,4 (steps 1), then 2,3,2 (step 1), total 2 steps. So dp[1][5] would be 2.

Then, the code would set dp[0][6] to min(1+dp[1][6], 1+dp[0][5], dp[1][5]) → which would be min(1+..., 1+..., 2).

But then, what is dp[1][6]?

The array [4,4,2,3,2,1]. The optimal steps for this.

The code would compute this as follows:

For i=1, j=6:

c[1] =4, c[6] =1. So no equality. The code would initialize dp[1][6] to min(1+dp[2][6], 1+dp[1][5]).

dp[2][6] is the array [4,2,3,2,1]. How is this computed?

But this could be time-consuming to compute manually.

But in the sample, after removing the two 4's, the remaining array is [1,2,3,2,1], which is a palindrome. So the minimal steps for the entire array is 2.

But according to the code's transitions, how does it capture this?

The code's DP for i=0, j=6 would consider the split into i=0 and k=2 (the two 4's). But the code's split is into i..k and k+1..j. So, in this case, if k=2, then i..k is [0..2], which is 1,4,4. This is a palindrome? 1,4,4: no. So removing this would take steps. dp[0][2] would be 1 step if the segment is a palindrome, but it's not. The first element is 1, the last is 4. So no. So dp[0][2] would be 2 steps (remove 1, then 4,4). Then, the other part is 3..6: [2,3,2,1]. The minimal steps for this would be 2 steps (remove 3, then 2,2,1, but wait, 2,3,2 is a palindrome. So remove 2,3,2 (step 1), then 1 (step 1). So total 2 steps. So dp[3][6] is 2. So the split into 0..2 and 3..6 would give 2 + 2 =4 steps, but the code would have other options.

But in the code's current approach, it's not considering the possibility of removing the 4,4 first and then the remaining array. Because when splitting into 0..2 and 3..6, the code's approach would split the entire array into two parts, and process each part. But in reality, removing the 4,4 allows the remaining parts to form a palindrome. So the code's current approach does not capture this, which suggests that the code is incorrect.

So the problem is that the standard DP approach does not consider that removing a palindrome in the middle can allow the left and right parts to form a larger palindrome, which can be removed in one step. The code's approach only considers splitting into two parts, but not the possibility of merging after a split.

Thus, the key is to find a way to capture this in the transitions.

An alternative idea comes from the problem of removing palindromic subsequences, but this problem requires removing substrings (which must be contiguous).

Another observation: the minimal steps for the entire array can't exceed the minimal steps for each individual element (i.e., n steps). But some cases require that.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct approach is to model the DP as follows:

dp[i][j] = min steps to remove the segment i..j.

The transitions are:

If i > j: 0.

If i == j: 1.

Else:

dp[i][j] = min(

   1 + dp[i+1][j],   // remove i

   1 + dp[i][j-1],   // remove j

   min_{k=i to j-1} (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])   // split into two parts

)

Additionally, if c[i] == c[j], then:

   if j == i+1:

      dp[i][j] = 1

   else:

      dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])

   // Also, look for any k between i+1 and j-1 where c[k] == c[i]

   for k from i+1 to j-1:

      if c[k] == c[i]:

          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k][j])

)

But I'm not sure. Let's see.

In the third sample, for i=0 and j=6 (c[i] = 1, c[j] =1), the code would check:

dp[0][6] = min(1 + dp[1][6], 1 + dp[0][5], ...)

Then, since c[0] == c[6], it would check dp[1][5]. dp[1][5] is the steps for [4,4,2,3,2]. This would be 2 steps (remove 4,4 then 2,3,2). So dp[0][6] would be min(..., 2).

But according to the sample, the answer is 2. But this would require that the code's transitions capture that. So in this case, the code's transition when c[i] == c[j] and j != i+1, set dp[i][j] to min(..., dp[i+1][j-1]).

In this case, the code would set dp[0][6] to 2.

So the code's transitions may work.

But why? Because the inner part (i+1..j-1) is [4,4,2,3,2], which is processed in 2 steps. Then, the outer 1's are added, and the entire segment can be processed in 2 steps. But how does that work?

Wait, the code's transition when c[i] == c[j] and j != i+1 sets dp[i][j] to min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1]). So in this case, dp[0][6] would be set to 2.

But why would that be the case? Because the two outer 1's are merged with the inner steps. How?

Ah, perhaps the code's transition assumes that after removing the inner part in m steps, the two outer 1's form a palindrome of length 2 and can be removed in one step. So total steps m + 1. But if the inner steps are m steps, then adding the two 1's would require m+1 steps. But in the code's transition, it's possible that the code sets dp[i][j] to m steps.

So, this suggests that the code's transitions are not correct. Because in this case, the inner steps would take 2 steps, then the outer 1's would form a palindrome of length 2, requiring an additional step. So total 3 steps, but the code would set dp[i][j] to 2 steps, which is not correct.

But in the sample, the answer is 2 steps. How is this achieved?

Ah, because the first step removes the 4,4 (steps 1), then the remaining array is 1,2,3,2,1, which is a palindrome and can be removed in one step. So total 2 steps.

But how does the code capture this?

In this case, the code's transitions would compute dp[0][6] as follows:

When considering the split between i=0 and j=6, and c[0] == c[6], the code would set dp[0][6] = min(dp[0][6], dp[1][5]).

dp[1][5] is the steps for the array [4,4,2,3,2]. This array's optimal steps are 2. So dp[1][5] = 2.

Thus, the code would set dp[0][6] to 2, which is correct.

But how does dp[1][5] become 2 steps?

For the array [4,4,2,3,2], the code's transitions would:

Check the case where i=1, j=5. c[1] =4, c[5]=2. So no equality.

Then, the code would check splits. For example, when k=2 (4,4), the split would be [4] (steps 1) + [4,2,3,2] (steps 3). So total 4.

But the optimal is to remove 4,4 (steps 1) and then 2,3,2 (steps 1). Total 2 steps.

So how does the code compute dp[1][5] = 2?

Let's see. For i=1, j=5 (array [4,4,2,3,2]):

The code would initialize dp[1][5] to min(1 + dp[2][5], 1 + dp[1][4]).

Then, since c[1] != c[5], it would not set anything from the c[i] == c[j] case.

Then, it would check all possible splits, including k=2.

But when k=2, the code splits into [4,4] and [2,3,2].

dp[1][2] is 1 step (since c[1] == c[2], j == i+1).

dp[3][5] is the steps for [2,3,2], which is 1 step (palindrome). So the split would give 1+1=2 steps.

Thus, the code would set dp[1][5] to 2.

Ah, I see. So the code's approach does capture this case.

Thus, the code's transitions are sufficient to find the correct answer.

So the code's approach is as follows:

The code fills the DP table in a bottom-up manner, considering all possible splits and the case where the ends are the same.

The key is that when the ends are the same, it allows for merging the steps from the inner segment.

The code for the third sample would compute dp[0][6] as min(1+dp[1][6], 1+dp[0][5], dp[1][5], and other splits).

But in this case, the code's transition for c[i] == c[j] would set dp[0][6] to dp[1][5], which is 2, leading to the correct answer.

Thus, the code's approach seems correct.

So, the steps for the code are:

Initialize a 2D DP table of size n x n.

Precompute the palindrome array.

But the code does not precompute the palindrome array. Instead, the code's transitions handle the case where the entire segment is a palindrome via the case where c[i] == c[j] and the inner segment is a palindrome.

But how?

In the code's transition, when c[i] == c[j], then the steps for i..j can be min(..., dp[i+1][j-1]). For example, if i+1..j-1 is a palindrome, then dp[i+1][j-1] is 1. So the code would set dp[i][j] to 1. Which is correct.

Thus, the code's approach is correct.

Now, let's code this.

The code will use dynamic programming, filling the DP table for all intervals of length 1, then 2, etc.

Here's the code outline:

n = int(input())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
n = len(c)
dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if i == j:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            # Initialize with removing left or right
            min_val = min(1 + dp[i+1][j], 1 + dp[i][j-1])
            # Check if ends are same
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                if j == i+1:
                    min_val = 1
                else:
                    min_val = min(min_val, dp[i+1][j-1])
            # Check all possible splits
            for k in range(i, j):
                min_val = min(min_val, dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
            # Check for cases where c[i] == c[k], and merge
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                for k in range(i+1, j):
                    if c[k] == c[i]:
                        if k == i+1:
                            temp = 1 + dp[k+1][j-1]
                        else:
                            temp = dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k][j]
                        min_val = min(min_val, temp)
            dp[i][j] = min_val

print(dp[0][n-1])

But wait, this code includes an additional loop for checking when c[i] == c[k]. This is based on the idea that if there is a k between i and j where c[k] == c[i], then perhaps the steps can be reduced by merging i's steps with k's steps.

But this part is not part of the standard approach and may not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's initial approach, without this loop, would work. Let's test the third sample.

In the third sample, the code's initial approach (without the loop) would compute:

For i=0, j=6:

c[0] == c[6] (1 == 1). So min_val is min(1+dp[1][6], 1+dp[0][5], dp[1][5]).

dp[1][5] is 2. So min_val would be 2.

Then, the code checks all possible splits between i=0 and j=6, including k=2.

For k=2, dp[0][2] is 2 (steps to remove 1,4,4: 1 step for 4,4, and 1 for 1).

dp[3][6] is [2,3,2,1]. The code computes this as:

i=3, j=6:

c[3] =2, c[6] =1. So no equality.

The code checks splits. For example, k=5:

dp[3][5] is 1 (palindrome 2,3,2) and dp[6][6] is 1. Total 2.

So dp[3][6] is 2. So split into 0..2 (steps 2) and 3..6 (steps 2) gives total 4.

But there's another split in between. For example, when k=3:

dp[0][3] is steps to remove 1,4,4,2. This would take 2 steps (remove 4,4 and then 1 and 2). dp[4][6] is steps to remove 3,2,1. That's 3 steps. So total 2+3=5.

But the code's initial approach would have already found the min_val of 2, which is correct.

Thus, the code's initial approach, without the additional loop, works.

So perhaps the code can be written as:

n = int(input())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
if n == 0:
    print(0)
    exit()
dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if i == j:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            # Base cases: remove first or last
            dp[i][j] = min(1 + (dp[i+1][j] if i+1 < n else 0), 1 + (dp[i][j-1] if j-1 >=0 else 0))
            # Check if ends are same
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                if j == i + 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])
            # Check all possible splits
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
print(dp[0][n-1])

But let's test this code on the third sample.

The third sample:

n=7

c = [1,4,4,2,3,2,1]

Let's compute dp[0][6].

When i=0, j=6:

c[i] == c[j], so the code checks j ==i+1? No. Then, the code sets dp[i][j] to min(current value, dp[1][5]).

What is dp[1][5]?

dp[1][5] corresponds to the array [4,4,2,3,2].

For i=1, j=5:

c[1] =4, c[5] =2. So not same.

The code initializes to min(1+dp[2][5], 1+dp[1][4]).

What is dp[2][5]?

i=2, j=5: [4,2,3,2].

For this, the code initializes to 1+dp[3][5] (which is 1+ dp[3][5]) and 1+dp[2][4].

dp[3][5] is [2,3,2], which is a palindrome. So dp[3][5] is 1.

So 1+1=2 for the first option.

1+dp[2][4] is 1 + steps for [4,2,3].

Steps for [4,2,3]: each is separate. So steps 3.

 So the code initializes to min(2, 4) → 2.

Then, splits are considered. For example, k=2,3.

For k=3: dp[2][3] is [4,2], which takes 2 steps. dp[4][5] is [3,2], which takes 2 steps. Total 4.

But then, the code checks all splits and finds the minimal.

However, there's a split at k=3 where the left is [4,2,3], steps 3, and the right is [2], steps 1. Total 4.

But the code's initial value is 2.

Then, the code sets dp[2][5] to 2.

Back to dp[1][5]:

The code initializes to min(1+2, 1+dp[1][4]).

dp[1][4] is [4,4,2,3].

For i=1, j=4:

c[1] == c[4] (4 ==3?), no.

So code initializes to min(1+dp[2][4], 1+dp[1][3]).

dp[2][4] is [4,2,3]. Steps 3.

dp[1][3] is [4,4,2]. Steps: c[1] ==c[3] (4 vs 2: no). So code splits. For example, split into [4,4], steps 1, and [2], steps 1. So total 2.

Thus, dp[1][3] is 2.

So code initializes to min(1+3, 1+2) → 3.

Then, check splits.

For k=1: dp[1][1] + dp[2][4] → 1+3=4.

For k=2: dp[1][2] (steps for [4,4] → 1) + dp[3][4] (steps for [2,3] → 2) → 3.

For k=3: dp[1][3] (2) + dp[4][4] (1) → 3.

So the minimal is 3. Thus, dp[1][4] is 3.

So back to dp[1][5]: initial value is min(1+2, 1+3) → 3.

Then, check splits:

For k=1: dp[1][1] (1) + dp[2][5] (2) → 3.

For k=2: dp[1][2] (1) + dp[3][5] (1) → 2. So this is better.

So dp[1][5] is 2.

Thus, dp[1][5] is 2.

So back to dp[0][6], which is min(1 + dp[1][6], 1 + dp[0][5], dp[1][5] = 2).

Now, what is dp[1][6]?

dp[1][6] is for [4,4,2,3,2,1].

For i=1, j=6:

c[1] =4, c[6] =1. Not same.

Initial value is min(1+dp[2][6], 1+dp[1][5] = 2).

dp[2][6] is [4,2,3,2,1]. Let's compute that.

For i=2, j=6:

c[2] =4, c[6] =1. Not same.

Initial value is min(1+dp[3][6], 1+dp[2][5] = 2).

dp[3][6] is [2,3,2,1]. Steps would be 2 steps: remove 2,3,2 (step 1), then 1 (step 1). So dp[3][6] is 2.

So initial value for dp[2][6] is min(1+2, 1+2) → 3.

Then, check splits:

For k=2,3,4,5.

For k=3: dp[2][3] ([4,2] → steps 2) + dp[4][6] → [3,2,1] → steps 3. Total 5.

For k=4: dp[2][4] ([4,2,3] → steps 3) + dp[5][6] ([2,1] → steps 2). Total 5.

For k=5: dp[2][5] is 2 (from earlier) + dp[6][6] (1) → 3.

So the minimal is 3. So dp[2][6] is 3.

Thus, back to dp[1][6], initial value is min(1+3, 1+2) → 3.

Then, check splits:

For example, split into k=1 and k+1=2..6: 1 + 3 =4.

Split into k=2: dp[1][2] (1) + dp[3][6] (2) → 3.

So the minimal is 3.

Thus, dp[1][6] is 3.

So back to dp[0][6], the code's initial value is min(1+3=4, 1 + dp[0][5] ... , 2).

So the code would set dp[0][6] to 2, which is correct.

Thus, the code's approach works for this case.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, to implement this in Python.

The code will fill the DP table bottom-up.

Let's write the code.

Read n, then the list of colors.

Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n.

Loop i from n-1 downto 0:

   for j in range(i, n):

      if i ==j: dp[i][j] =1.

      else:

         option1 = 1 + dp[i+1][j]

         option2 = 1 + dp[i][j-1]

         dp[i][j] = min(option1, option2)

         if c[i] == c[j]:

             if j == i+1:

                 dp[i][j] =1

             else:

                 dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])

         for k in range(i, j):

             dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])

Finally, output dp[0][n-1].

But in Python, for the loops, we need to manage the indices correctly.

Now, implementing this.

The code will be:

n = int(input())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
if not c:
    print(0)
    exit()
n = len(c)
dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if i == j:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            # Base cases: remove first or last
            option1 = dp[i+1][j] + 1 if (i+1 < n) else 1
            option2 = dp[i][j-1] + 1 if (j-1 >=0) else 1
            dp[i][j] = min(option1, option2)
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                if j == i + 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])
            # Check all possible splits
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])

print(dp[0][n-1])

Testing this code with the third sample:

Input:

7

1 4 4 2 3 2 1

Output is 2, which is correct.

Second sample:

3

1 2 3 → output 3.

First sample:

3

1 2 1 → output 1.

Yes.

Thus, the code should work.

But to handle the case when n=0 (though according to constraints, n >=1), the code checks if not c, but the problem states n ≥1.

Thus, the code should be correct.

```python
n = int(input())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if i == j:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            # Initialize with removing left or right
            option1 = dp[i + 1][j] + 1 if (i + 1 < n) else 1
            option2 = dp[i][j - 1] + 1 if (j - 1 >= 0) else 1
            dp[i][j] = min(option1, option2)
            if c[i] == c[j]:
                if j == i + 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][j - 1])
            # Check all possible splits
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j])

print(dp[0][n - 1])
