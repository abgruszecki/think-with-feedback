Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum cost Misha has to pay to buy exactly k shovels, using the best possible combination of offers. The offers allow him to get some of the cheapest shovels in a purchase for free. Hmm.

First, I need to process the input. The shovels are given in a list, and we need to select k of them. Since we want the minimal cost, it's optimal to choose the k cheapest shovels. Because, even if using offers, the more expensive ones would cost more. So step one: sort the array and take the first k elements.

Once we have the sorted list of the k cheapest shovels, the problem reduces to finding how to optimally apply the offers to minimize the sum paid. Each offer (x_j, y_j) allows us to take x_j shovels in a purchase and get y_j cheapest ones free. But how do we combine these offers?

Wait, but offers can be used multiple times. So for example, if there's an offer (2,1), using it multiple times would mean grouping shovels into batches of 2, each time getting one free. But the order in which we group them matters. But since the shovels are sorted, the cheapest are first, so when applying offers, the free ones are the first y_j in each group. Wait no. Wait, during a purchase, when you take exactly x_j shovels, the y_j cheapest in that group are free. So the way to maximize savings is to have each group's cheapest y_j shovels be as expensive as possible. Wait, no. Wait, in a group of x shovels, the y cheapest are free. So to save the most money, you want those y cheapest in the group to be the most expensive possible within that group. Because then, the sum saved is the sum of those y shovels. So for example, if in a group of 3 shovels sorted as a, b, c (a <= b <= c), then using an offer (3,1) would save a. But if the group is c, b, a (assuming they are sorted), then the saved is a again. So regardless of the order, the sum saved is the sum of the first y_j in the sorted group. But since we have the shovels sorted in ascending order, grouping consecutive shovels and using an offer would save the sum of the first y_j in that group. Wait, no. Let's see. Let's say the shovels are sorted in ascending order, so the first is the cheapest. If during a purchase, you take a group of x_j shovels, the first y_j (cheapest) are free. So, for example, if the group is [1,2,3], and the offer is (3,1), then you save 1. But if the group is [3,2,1], sorted would be [1,2,3], so again you save 1. Wait, no. Because the offer says during the purchase, the subset is bought. The shovels are sorted, and the offer applies to the subset in the purchase. So when you select a subset, you sort those, take the y_j cheapest (the first ones in that sorted subset), and pay for the rest. So the optimal way to apply an offer is to group the shovels in such a way that the sum of the non-free ones is minimized. Which, given that the shovels are already sorted, implies that we should take groups of consecutive shovels in the sorted list. Because, for example, if I have a sorted list and I group some of them, the ones in each group must be the ones with higher indices (i.e., more expensive) to minimize the sum saved. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: suppose the sorted list is a1 <= a2 <= ... <= ak. If I take a group of x_j shovels. The best way to save the maximum is to have the first y_j of them (the cheapest in the group) be as expensive as possible. So in the sorted list, the group with higher indices (more expensive) would have higher a_i's, so saving more. Wait, no. Because the free ones are the cheapest in the group. So if I have a group of shovels that are the most expensive, the cheapest in that group would still be the first of those, but the sum saved would be the sum of the y_j cheapest in the group. So for example, if I group the last x_j shovels (the most expensive ones), then the y_j cheapest in that group would be the first x_j - (x_j - y_j) = y_j ones. Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose x_j is 3, y_j is 1. So group of 3 shovels. If I take the three most expensive ones, say a_{k-2}, a_{k-1}, a_k. Sorted, the cheapest is a_{k-2}, so that's the one saved. So the sum saved is a_{k-2}. Alternatively, if I group a_{k-3}, a_{k-2}, a_{k-1}, then the saved one is a_{k-3}. So in this case, grouping the more expensive ones saves more. So the optimal approach is to group the largest possible shovels (in the sorted list) when using an offer, so that the y_j free ones are the smallest in that group, which are as large as possible. So, for maximum savings, we should arrange groups such that each group's y_j free shovels are as expensive as possible. Therefore, the groups should be formed starting from the end (the most expensive shovels) and working backwards. 

But how do I model this? It seems like a dynamic programming problem. For each possible number of shovels bought (from 0 to k), we can track the minimal cost. Let's think of dp[i] as the minimal cost to buy i shovels. The base case is dp[0] = 0, and we need to compute dp[k].

To compute dp[i], we can consider all possible offers (x, y) where x <= i, and see if applying this offer to a group of x shovels would save some cost. So for each possible j, where j can be i - x, we can take x shovels starting from j+1 to j + x. The cost saved would be the sum of the first y shovels in that group (since those are the cheapest in the group and thus free). Wait, but in the sorted list, the group from j+1 to j + x would be the shovels a_{j+1}, a_{j+2}, ..., a_{j+x}. But since the list is sorted in ascending order, the first y of these are a_{j+1} ... a_{j+y}. So the sum saved is sum(a_{j+1} ... a_{j+y}).

Wait, no. Wait, the group is x shovels. The first y are the cheapest, which are the first y in the sorted group. So if the group is a sorted list, then the y cheapest are the first y. So when you take x shovels from the sorted list (which is already sorted), the group is a subset of consecutive shovels. So for example, if I take a subset from position i to i + x -1 (assuming sorted in ascending order), then the first y in this subset (the cheapest) are a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+y-1]. Wait, but the sorted list is in ascending order. So the group is consecutive in the sorted list, and the cheapest in the group are the first y. So if we group a certain set of shovels, the sum saved is the sum of the first y of them.

Therefore, the approach is to precompute the prefix sums of the sorted list. Then, for each possible group of x shovels (from some position), the sum saved is the sum of the first y in that group.

So the dynamic programming approach would be:

- Sort the array and take the first k elements.
- Compute the prefix sum array S where S[i] is the sum of the first i shovels.
- Initialize dp[0] = 0.
- For each i from 1 to k:
   dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i] (since you can buy one shovel, paying for it)
   Then, for each offer (x, y) where x <= i:
      if i >= x, then you can take the last x shovels (since they are the most expensive in the current i) and apply the offer. So the cost would be dp[i-x] + (sum of x - y shovels in that group). The sum of x - y shovels is (sum of the group) - (sum of first y in the group). But since the group is the last x shovels up to i, the sum of the group is S[i] - S[i-x], and the sum of the first y is S[i-x + y] - S[i-x]. Wait, no. Wait, the group is from i-x to i-1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based). Let's clarify the indices.

Assuming that the sorted list is 0-based, with a[0] being the cheapest, a[k-1] the most expensive in the k selected.

The prefix sum S is S[0] = 0, S[1] = a[0], S[2] = a[0] + a[1], ..., S[i] = sum of the first i shovels.

So for the group of x shovels in positions (i-x) to (i-x + x -1) = i-1. The sum of the group is S[i] - S[i-x]. The first y of the group (the cheapest) are a[i-x], a[i-x+1], ..., a[i-x + y-1], so their sum is S[i-x + y] - S[i-x].

So when applying offer (x,y) to i shovels, the cost is (sum of the group) - (sum of first y) = (S[i] - S[i-x]) - (S[i-x + y] - S[i-x]) = S[i] - S[i-x + y].

Wait, yes. Because the total cost for that purchase is the sum of the x shovels minus the sum of the y cheapest (so sum x - sum y). So the cost for that group is (sum x) - sum y = sum (x - y) shovels (the more expensive ones in the group). Then, adding that to the previous state. So the dp transition would be:

dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-x] + (sum of the x shovels group) - (sum of the y cheapest in group))

Which is dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - x] + (S[i] - S[i -x] ) - (S[i -x + y] - S[i -x] ) )

Simplify that: S[i] - S[i -x + y] 

So dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i -x] + (S[i] - S[i -x + y]) )

But how do we handle multiple offers? For each offer, we can consider all possible x and y. But if there are m offers, each of which could be (x, y), but perhaps some offers are redundant. For example, if two offers have the same x but different y, we should only keep the best one (the one with the largest y). Because for a given x, the maximum possible y gives the best saving. So for each x, we should track the maximum y available.

Yes. So first, for all offers, we can process them to keep, for each x, the maximum possible y. So for example, if there are two offers (3,1) and (3,2), the second one is better. So for x=3, the maximum y is 2.

Therefore, the first step is to process all the offers and for each x_j, find the maximum y_j. So create a dictionary where key is x_j and value is the maximum y_j for that x. Then, for each x in the dictionary, we have the best possible y for that x.

This is important because otherwise, considering all m offers would be O(m) for each step in DP, which could be O(k*m) time. But if m is up to 2e5, and k up to 2000, that's 2e5 * 2e3 = 4e8 operations, which is way too slow.

So by pre-processing the offers to group by x and keep the maximum y for each x, we can reduce the number of possible x's to consider. Since x can be up to k (since you can't use an offer x larger than the current i in DP), and after pre-processing, for each x, we have the best possible y.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the array a, take the first k elements, and sort them in ascending order.

2. Compute the prefix sum array S.

3. Process all offers, keeping for each x the maximum y. Let's call this best_offers, a dictionary where best_offers[x] = max y.

4. Now, for the dynamic programming part:

   Initialize dp[0] = 0.

   For each i from 1 to k:

      dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i-1] (since the i-th shovel in the sorted list is a[i-1], 0-based)

      Then, for each x in best_offers:

          if x <= i:

              y = best_offers[x]

              if i - x >= 0:

                  cost = dp[i -x] + (S[i] - S[i -x + y])

                  if cost < dp[i]:

                      dp[i] = cost

So for each i, we try all possible x (from the best_offers) where x <= i, and compute the possible transition.

But how many x's are there in best_offers after processing? Since m can be up to 2e5, but after grouping, the number of unique x's is up to 2e5. But even that could be too much for k=2000.

Wait, but for each x in best_offers, x can be up to 2e5, but in the DP step, when i is up to 2000, x can't be larger than i. So for each i, the x's we need to consider are those in best_offers where x <= i and x <=k (since k is the maximum possible in the problem statement). Wait, k can be up to 2000, but the offers can have x up to n (2e5). But when i is up to 2000, x can't be larger than i. So in the best_offers dictionary, we can ignore x's larger than k, because for any i up to k, x can't exceed i. So during pre-processing, for all offers (x, y), if x > k, we can ignore them, since they can't be used. Because if x > k, then even for i=k, x can't be <= i. So that's an important optimization. So first, filter all offers where x >k, and for the remaining, keep the best y per x.

So during the pre-processing step:

- For each offer (x_j, y_j), if x_j >k, skip it. Otherwise, add it to the best_offers, keeping the maximum y_j for each x_j.

This way, the maximum possible x in best_offers is k, which for k up to 2000, gives up to 2000 possible x's to check for each i.

So the number of x's per i is O(k), which is 2000. For i up to 2000, total operations would be 2000 * 2000 = 4e6, which is acceptable.

So this approach is feasible.

Now, let's think about the example:

First sample input:

7 4 5

2 5 4 2 6 3 1

The sorted array of all shovels is [1,2,2,3,4,5,6]. But since k=5, take the first 5: [1,2,2,3,4]. Then, sorted in ascending order. Wait, wait no: when you select the k cheapest shovels, you sort the entire array and take the first k. So in this case, the original array is [2,5,4,2,6,3,1]. Sort all shovels: 1,2,2,3,4,5,6. Take the first 5: [1,2,2,3,4]. Then sorted again in ascending order. Wait, but they are already sorted. So the sorted list is [1,2,2,3,4]. The prefix sums S[0]=0, S[1]=1, S[2]=3, S[3]=5, S[4]=8, S[5]=12.

The best_offers after processing:

The offers are (2,1), (6,5) (ignored since x=6>5), (2,1), (3,1).

So after filtering x <=5, we have offers (2,1), (2,1), (3,1). So best_offers for x=2 is y=1, x=3 is y=1.

So for each i from 1 to 5, compute dp[i].

Let's see:

dp[0] =0.

i=1:

option 1: take previous (dp[0]) and add a[0] (1). So 1.

No offers possible (x must be <=1. x can be 1, but offers for x=1? There's none. So dp[1] =1.

i=2:

option 1: dp[1] + a[1] =1 +2=3.

Check offers x=2. y=1.

i-x=0. So dp[0] + (S[2] - S[0+1] ) = 0 + (3 -1) = 2. So dp[2] is min(3, 2) → 2.

i=3:

option 1: dp[2] + a[2] → 2 +2=4.

Check offers:

x=2: i-x=3-2=1. dp[1] is 1. cost is 1 + (S[3] - S[1+1]) → S[3] is 5, S[2] is 3. 5-3=2. So 1+2=3. So dp[3] is min(4,3) →3.

x=3: check if x<=3. yes. i-x=0. dp[0] + S[3] - S[0 +1] =0 +5 -1=4. So 4. current min is 3.

So dp[3]=3.

i=4:

option1: dp[3] + a[3] =3+3=6.

Check offers:

x=2: i-x=4-2=2. dp[2] is 2. cost is 2 + (S[4] - S[2+1] ) → S[4] is8, S[3] is5 →3. So 2+3=5. So current min is 5.

x=3: i-x=4-3=1. dp[1]=1. cost is 1 + (S[4] - S[1 +1] ) → S[4] - S[2] =8-3=5 → 1+5=6. So current min is 5.

So dp[4]=5.

i=5:

option1: dp[4] +a[4] =5+4=9.

Check offers:

x=2: i-x=5-2=3. dp[3]=3. cost is 3 + (S[5] - S[3 +1] ) → S[5] is12, S[4] is8. 12-8=4. So 3+4=7.

x=3: i-x=5-3=2. dp[2]=2. cost is 2 + (S[5] - S[2 +1] ) →12-5=7. 2+7=9.

So the best is 7.

Which matches the sample output.

So the approach works.

Now, the plan is:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read the array a, sort it, take the first k elements, sort them again (just in case, but after selecting the first k, which are the smallest, they are already in order if the original array is sorted).

Wait, wait, the first k elements are the k smallest. So when we sort the original array, select the first k, then they are sorted. So the sorted list is a[:k] after sorting the entire array.

So steps:

Sort the entire array in ascending order.

Take the first k elements, sorted.

So the list is already sorted.

Compute the prefix sum S, where S[0] =0, S[1] =a[0], S[2] =a[0]+a[1], ..., S[k] = sum of a[0] to a[k-1}.

3. Process offers: for each (x,y), if x>k, ignore. Otherwise, keep the maximum y per x.

4. Initialize dp array. Since k can be up to 2000, the dp array can be of size 2001.

Initialize dp[0] =0.

For i from 1 to k:

   dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i-1]

   Then for each x in best_offers:

       if x <=i:

           y = best_offers[x]

           possible_prev = i -x

           if possible_prev >=0:

               cost = dp[possible_prev] + (S[i] - S[possible_prev + y])

               if cost < dp[i]:

                   dp[i] = cost

The final answer is dp[k].

Now, let's code this.

But first, let's handle the prefix sums. For example, in the first sample:

a_sorted = [1,2,2,3,4]

S[0] =0

S[1] =1

S[2] =3

S[3] =5

S[4] =8

S[5] =12

So when i=5, possible_prev =5-2=3, possible_prev + y =3+1=4. S[5]-S[4] =12-8=4. So dp[3] is 3 →3+4=7.

Now, code steps:

Read n, m, k.

Read a array.

Sort a, take first k elements, then sort again (but they are already sorted, so this is redundant, but just to be safe).

Compute prefix sums.

Process the offers.

best_offers is a dictionary, initialized as empty. For each offer (x,y):

   if x >k: skip.

   else:

       if x not in best_offers or best_offers[x] < y:

           best_offers[x] =y.

Then, collect all the x's in best_offers into a list, say offers_list.

Then, for the DP:

Initialize dp as a list of size k+1.

dp[0] =0.

for i in 1 to k:

   dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a_sorted[i-1]

   for x in offers_list:

       if x >i:

           continue

       y = best_offers[x]

       possible_prev =i -x

       if possible_prev <0:

           continue

       possible_cost = dp[possible_prev] + (S[i] - S[possible_prev + y])

       if possible_cost < dp[i]:

           dp[i] = possible_cost

return dp[k]

Now, for the code:

But how to compute the prefix sums? Let's code that.

In Python:

a_sorted = sorted(a)[:k]

prefix = [0]*(k+1)

for i in range(1, k+1):

   prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a_sorted[i-1]

Now, the offers:

best_offers = {}

for _ in range(m):

   xj, yj = map(int, input().split())

   if xj >k:

       continue

   if xj in best_offers:

       if yj > best_offers[xj]:

           best_offers[xj] = yj

   else:

       best_offers[xj] = yj

Then, offers_list is best_offers.keys(). But for efficiency, it's better to iterate over the keys once.

Then, in the DP loop.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

    n, m, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

Wait, this indicates that the code isn't considering all possible offers. Let me check the sample input again.

Wait, the second sample input:

9 4 8

6 8 5 1 8 1 1 2 1

The offers are:

9 2 →x=9>8, ignored.

8 4 →x=8, y=4.

5 3 →x=5, y=3.

8 4 →another x=8, y=4 (but in code, best_offers[x=8] is 4).

9 7 →x=9>8, ignored.

So best_offers has x=8 (y=4) and x=5 (y=3).

So for i=8, the code checks x=8 and x=5.

For x=5:

prev =8-5=3.

sum_saved=prefix[8] - prefix[3+3=6] →32-16=16. dp[3] is the sum of first 3 shovels (1+1+1=3). So cost is 3+16=19.

But the sample's correct output is 17. So why?

Ah, because there's a better way.

In the sample note, Misha buys 5 shovels in a group (using x=5, y=3). Let's see:

The group is x=5, but in the code, when x=5 and i=8, the group is 5 shovels starting at prev=3. So shovels at positions 3,4,5,6,7 (0-based). These are 2,5,6,8,8. The y=3 cheapest in this group are 2,5,6. So the sum saved is 2+5+6=13. The sum of the group is 2+5+6+8+8=29. The cost for this group is 29 -13 =16. So adding to dp[3] (sum of first 3 shovels:3) →3+16=19. But according to the sample, the total is 17.

Hmm, the sample's approach was to use the x=9 2 offer (but x=9 is ignored because k=8). No, sample note says he bought 5 shovels (positions 1,2,3,4,8), but wait, perhaps the code isn't considering overlapping groups or other offers.

Alternatively, maybe there's another offer that wasn't considered.

Wait, perhaps the code is missing some offers.

Wait, in the sample input, the third offer is (5,3), which is kept. So the code should consider it. So why is the code's answer 19, but the sample's correct answer is 17?

Ah, perhaps there are other offers that weren't processed. Let me re-examine the sample.

The sample input's offers are:

After the first line, the offers are:

2 1

6 5

2 1

3 1

Wait, no, the second sample's offers are:

9 2

8 4

5 3

9 7

Which, after processing, the code's best_offers is x=8 (y=4) and x=5 (y=3).

But in the sample explanation, Misha uses an offer that gives three free shovels when buying five. So in the code's calculation, that would be the x=5, y=3 offer. But the code's calculation for that case gives 3+16=19, but the sample's answer is 17. So something is wrong.

Ah, perhaps the code is incorrect. Let me re-examine the code.

Wait, in the code, the a_sorted is sorted(a)[:k]. So for the second sample, the a array is:

Original array:6 8 5 1 8 1 1 2 1 → sorted is [1,1,1,1,2,5,6,8,8]. Take first 8 elements → [1,1,1,1,2,5,6,8]. Then sorted, which is same as the list. So a_sorted is [1,1,1,1,2,5,6,8].

prefix sums:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =1

prefix[2] =2

prefix[3] =3

prefix[4] =4

prefix[5] =6 (4+2)

prefix[6] =11 (6+5)

prefix[7] =17 (11+6)

prefix[8] =25 (17+8)

Ah, wait! That's different from what I thought earlier. Because the sorted array for the second sample is different.

Wait, the original array is [6,8,5,1,8,1,1,2,1]. When sorted in ascending order, it's:

1 (index 3), 1 (index5), 1 (index6), 1 (index8), 2 (index7),5 (index2),6 (index0),8 (index1),8 (index4). So the first 8 elements are [1,1,1,1,2,5,6,8]. So the prefix sums are:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =1

prefix[2] =2

prefix[3] =3

prefix[4] =4

prefix[5] =6 (4+2)

prefix[6] =11 (6+5)

prefix[7] =17 (11+6)

prefix[8] =25 (17+8)

So when i=8, the code's code for x=5:

prev =8-5=3.

sum_saved =prefix[8] - prefix[3+3=6] →25 -11=14.

dp[3] is 3 (sum of first 3 shovels:1+1+1=3). So cost is 3+14=17, which matches the sample output.

Ah, I see. My earlier mistake was in the calculation of the sorted list and prefix sums. So the code is correct.

So why in the earlier analysis for the second sample, the code gives 17. So the code's code for i=8 would be:

Initial dp[8] = sum of all 8 →25.

Then, check x=5:

prev=8-5=3.

sum_saved =25 - prefix[6] →25-11=14.

cost = dp[3] (3) +14=17.

Which is the sample's correct answer. So the code would output 17.

Ah, right. So the code is correct.

So the code works correctly for the samples.

Now, the code must handle the case where offers with x up to k, and the best_offers are correctly processed.

So, the code is correct.
</think>

```python
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a_sorted = sorted(a)[:k]

prefix = [0] * (k + 1)
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + a_sorted[i - 1]

best_offers = {}
for _ in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > k:
        continue
    if x in best_offers:
        if y > best_offers[x]:
            best_offers[x] = y
    else:
        best_offers[x] = y

offers = list(best_offers.items())

dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
dp[0] = 0

for i in range(1, k + 1):
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + a_sorted[i - 1]
    for (x, y) in offers:
        if x > i:
            continue
        prev = i - x
        if prev < 0:
            continue
        sum_saved = prefix[i] - prefix[prev + y]
        if dp[prev] + sum_saved < dp[i]:
            dp[i] = dp[prev] + sum_saved

print(dp[k])
```
