<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement says that we need to count the number of answer suits where after shifting clockwise by 1, the new score is strictly larger than the original. Let's think about how to model this.

First, let's understand the original and shifted scores. For each answer suit a, the original score is the number of positions where a_i equals h_i. The shifted a' (which is the shifted version) is such that a'_i = a_{i-1 mod n}. So, the shifted score is the sum of (a'_i == h_i) which is the same as sum of (a_{i-1} == h_i) for each i. But when we shift, the original a is shifted to become a', so the new score is comparing each a_j to h_{j+1} (since a_j is at position j+1 in the shifted array, except for a_n which goes to position 1). So for each a_j, in the original array, it contributes to the original score if a_j == h_j. In the shifted array, a_j (which is now at position j+1) contributes if a_j == h_{j+1} (with j+1 modulo n). 

So, for each answer suit a, we compute two sums:
- original: S = sum_{i=1 to n} (a_i == h_i)
- shifted: T = sum_{i=1 to n} (a_{i-1} == h_i) where i-1 is modulo n (so for i=1, it's a_n)

We need to find the number of a's where T > S.

The problem is to count all possible a's such that T > S. Since each a has n positions, each with k choices, the total possible a's are k^n, but we need to count those that satisfy the condition.

Let's model this. Let's think for each position i, how a_i affects S and T. For each i, a_i is part of S in position i (as a_i is in the original array), and part of T in position i+1 (since a_i becomes the answer for position i+1 in the shifted array). 

So, for a particular a_i, it contributes 1 to S if a_i == h_i, and 1 to T if a_i == h_{i+1} (with h_{n+1} being h_1, since it's a circle). 

Wait, that's an important point. The shifted array's T is sum over all i of (a_{i-1} == h_i). Let's reindex that. Let j = i-1. Then T is sum over j=0 to n-1 (a_j == h_{j+1}), but since j is modulo n, for j=0, it's a_0 (a_1 in 1-based?), maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

In the problem statement, the shifted array a' is such that the answer for question i becomes the original a's i mod n + 1. Wait, maybe it's easier to model with 1-based indices. So:

Original a is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. After shifting, the new a' is [a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}]. So, for each position i in a', the value is a_{i-1}, where i-1 is taken modulo n. So, for i=1, it's a_n. For i=2, it's a_1. And so on. Then, the shifted T is sum_{i=1 to n} (a_{i-1} == h_i), where for i=1, a_{i-1} is a_n.

So, each a_j (original) is part of S in position j (contributing 1 if a_j == h_j), and part of T in position j+1 (contributing 1 if a_j == h_{j+1}, where j+1 is modulo n). For example, j = 1 contributes to T in position 2, j=2 to position 3, ..., j = n to position 1.

So, each a_j affects two terms: S's term j and T's term j+1. Let's model this for each j. For a_j, the possible choices can affect the difference between T and S.

The total T - S is sum_{j=1 to n} ( (a_j == h_{j+1}) - (a_j == h_j) ). We need this sum to be greater than 0.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of tuples (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) where sum_{j=1 to n} ( [a_j == h_{j+1}] - [a_j == h_j] ) > 0.

Let me denote for each j, the possible contribution to the sum as c_j, which is ( [a_j == h_{j+1}] - [a_j == h_j] ). So the total is sum c_j > 0.

Now, the key is to compute how each choice of a_j affects c_j. For each j, there are k possible choices for a_j. Let's compute for each j what the possible values of c_j are.

Case 1: h_j != h_{j+1}

In this case, for a_j:

- If a_j == h_j: then c_j is -1 (since [h_j == h_{j+1}] is 0, so 0-1= -1)
- If a_j == h_{j+1}: c_j is 1 (1 - 0)
- Else: c_j is 0 (0 -0 )

So, for this j, the possible contributions are:

- c_j can be -1, 0, or 1.

But how many choices for a_j give each of these?

If h_j and h_{j+1} are different:

- Number of a_j that make c_j = -1: 1 (a_j = h_j)
- Number of a_j that make c_j = 1: 1 (a_j = h_{j+1})
- The rest (k-2) choices give c_j = 0.

Case 2: h_j == h_{j+1}

Then:

If a_j is equal to h_j (and h_{j+1}), then [a_j == h_{j+1}] is 1, [a_j == h_j] is 1. So c_j = 0.

Otherwise, both terms are 0, so c_j is 0.

So in this case, regardless of a_j's choice, c_j is 0. So for this j, the contribution is always 0. So the number of possible a_j is k, but their choice doesn't affect the sum.

So, for each j where h_j != h_{j+1}, the choice of a_j can contribute -1, 0, or +1. For j where h_j == h_{j+1}, the contribution is always 0.

So the problem is now: we have m positions where h_j != h_{j+1} (let's call these 'variable' positions), and the others have no effect. For each variable position, the choice of a_j contributes a certain delta, and we need the sum of these deltas across all variable positions to be >0.

The rest of the positions (non-variable) can be chosen freely (each has k possibilities) because their choices do not affect the sum. So the total number of valid answer suits is equal to (number of valid combinations for the variable positions) multiplied by (k raised to the number of non-variable positions).

Thus, the problem reduces to:

1. Find all positions j where h_j != h_{j+1} (mod n, so h_{n+1} is h_1). Let's call this number m.

2. For these m positions, each can contribute a delta of -1, 0, or +1, based on the choice of a_j. The sum of these deltas must be >0.

3. The total answer is the sum over all possible combinations of deltas (for the m positions) where the total delta is >0, multiplied by the product of the number of choices for each delta, multiplied by k^(number of non-variable positions).

But how to compute this sum efficiently?

Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem. For each of the m positions, we track the possible sum of deltas and the number of ways to achieve that sum. The transitions would be based on the possible deltas each position can contribute and their counts.

The maximum possible sum is m (if all positions contribute +1), the minimum is -m (if all contribute -1). So the possible sum ranges from -m to +m. For each step in the DP, we can keep track of the current possible sums and the count of ways to reach them.

The DP state can be represented as dp[i][s], where i is the ith variable position being processed, and s is the current sum. The value of dp[i][s] is the number of ways to choose the first i positions such that their sum is s.

The base case is dp[0][0] = 1.

For each variable position j:

- For each possible current sum s in dp[i-1], we can add the possible deltas (-1, 0, +1), each multiplied by their respective counts.

Wait, for each variable position j (h_j != h_{j+1}), the possible deltas and their counts are:

- delta -1: 1 way (a_j = h_j)
- delta +1: 1 way (a_j = h_{j+1})
- delta 0: (k-2) ways (other choices)

So, for each variable position, when processing it, each possible delta contributes to the next sum.

The DP transition would be:

For each possible current sum s in dp[i-1], and for each possible delta d in {-1, 0, 1}, the new sum is s + d. The count for this new sum is increased by dp[i-1][s] multiplied by the number of ways this delta can be chosen (cnt_d).

But for each variable position, the cnt_d is:

- for delta -1: 1
- for delta +1: 1
- for delta 0: k-2

So for each variable position, the transitions are:

dp[i][s + d] += dp[i-1][s] * cnt_d for each d in possible deltas.

The key is to model this efficiently. However, since m can be up to 2000 (since n is up to 2000), and the sum can range from -m to m, the DP state is O(m^2) in space. For m=2000, the sum can range from -2000 to 2000, which is 4001 possible sums. So each DP step requires O(m) operations (since for each sum in the current step, we process three possible deltas). The total time complexity is O(m^2), which for m=2000 is 4,000,000 operations, which should be manageable.

Once the DP is filled, the total number of valid combinations is the sum of dp[m][s] for all s > 0. Then, multiply this by k^c, where c is the number of positions where h_j == h_{j+1} (since each of those positions can have any of the k choices, and their choice doesn't affect the sum).

So, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Compute m, the number of positions j where h[j] != h[j+1 mod n].

2. For each of these m positions, model their possible contributions using dynamic programming.

3. Compute the sum over all possible sums s > 0 of the number of ways to reach s.

4. Multiply this sum by (k^c) mod MOD, where c is the number of positions where h_j == h_{j+1}.

5. The result is the answer modulo 998244353.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

First, compute the list of positions where h[j] != h[(j+1) mod n]. Let's index h as 0-based or 1-based?

The input gives h_1 to h_n, so probably 1-based. But in code, it's easier to make it 0-based, so we can loop j from 0 to n-1, and check h[j] vs h[(j+1) % n].

Wait, the problem states that after the shift, the answer for question i is the original a's i mod n + 1. Wait, perhaps I should reindex. Let's think:

For each j from 1 to n, the original answer a_j is shifted to position j mod n +1. So j=1 is shifted to position 2, j=2 to 3, ..., j=n to 1. So in the shifted array, the answer for position i is a_{i-1} (for i=2..n), and a_n for i=1. So in terms of h, the correct answer for position i is h_i. The shifted a's contribution to T is sum over i of (a_{i-1} == h_i), where i runs from 1 to n. So for each a_j in the original array, it's part of S (if a_j == h_j) and part of T (if a_j == h_{j+1} where j+1 is modulo n, i.e., h_1 for j =n).

So in code, for j in 0-based:

If the original array is 0-based, then for each j from 0 to n-1:

In S, a_j contributes to the sum if a_j == h_j.

In T, a_j contributes to the sum at position (j+1) mod n. So a_j is compared to h[(j+1) mod n].

Therefore, for each j, h[j] and h[(j+1) mod n] are the two values to compare.

So, the code would first compute for each j (0-based) whether h[j] != h[(j+1) % n]. Let's count how many such j exist, that's m.

For example, in the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

3 3

1 3 1

So h is [1,3,1]. Then:

j=0: h[0] =1, h[1] =3 → 1 !=3 → yes.

j=1: h[1]=3, h[2]=1 →3 !=1 → yes.

j=2: h[2]=1, h[0]=1 →1 ==1 → no.

So m is 2.

So in the code, after processing all j from 0 to n-1, count how many j have h[j] != h[(j+1) % n]. Let's call that m.

The positions where h[j] == h[j+1] can be handled as contributing k possibilities each, but not affecting the sum.

So, the code steps:

1. Read n, k, h array.

2. Compute m: the count of j where h[j] != h[(j+1) % n].

3. Compute c = n - m (number of positions that do not contribute to the sum).

4. Compute the base multiplier: pow(k, c, MOD). This is because each non-contributing position contributes k options.

5. For the m contributing positions, compute the DP to find the number of ways to get sum > 0.

But how to compute the DP?

The DP can be implemented using a dictionary or a list to track the current sum possibilities. But for efficiency, using two arrays (current and next) is better.

The initial sum is 0. For each of the m positions, we process the possible deltas and update the possible sums.

In Python, for handling this, we can represent the DP as a list where the index is the sum (shifted by m to handle negative values). For example, since the maximum possible sum after m steps is m, and the minimum is -m, the total possible sums are from -m to m. So the offset would be m, making the indices go from 0 to 2m.

Wait, for example, m=2:

sum can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So the offset is 2. sum + offset = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So the array size is 2m +1.

So for general m, the possible sums range from -m to m. To represent this in a list, we can have an array of size 2m +1, where index s corresponds to sum = s - m.

But for m up to 2000, this array is 4001 elements. For each step, we can process this array.

So the steps for DP:

Initialize a list, dp, of size 2m +1, all zeros. dp[m] = 1 (since sum 0 is at index m).

For each of the m contributing positions:

   create a new list next_dp of size 2m +1, initialized to zero.

   for each possible sum s in the current dp (i.e., from -m to m):

       if dp[s + m] is zero, skip.

       else:

           for each possible delta in [-1, 0, 1]:

               new_sum = s + delta

               if new_sum < -m or new_sum > m: continue? No, because after m steps, the maximum sum is m (each step adds 1). But during processing, some steps may have sum exceeding the current possible range. However, the maximum possible sum after i steps is i (if all previous steps added +1). Similarly, the minimum is -i. So for the i-th step (processing the i-th contributing position), the sum can range from -i to i.

Wait, but in the code, since m is the total number of contributing positions, the initial step (0 contributing positions) can only have sum 0. Then, each step adds a delta in {-1, 0, 1} for the current contributing position.

So during the processing of the first contributing position, the sum can be -1, 0, +1.

Processing the second contributing position, possible sums are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.

Thus, for each step i (from 1 to m), the possible sums are from -i to i. So when processing the i-th position, the possible new sums are up to i.

But when m is up to 2000, the maximum possible sum after m steps is m, which for m=2000 is 2000. So the array size for the DP can be 2*2000 +1 = 4001, but during the processing of the first steps, only a subset of the array is used.

But in code, we can represent this with a list of size 2m +1, and handle the ranges appropriately.

So the code would:

Initialize dp as a list of zeros, with dp[m] = 1 (since initial sum is 0).

Then, for each of the m contributing positions:

   create a new list next_dp of zeros.

   for s_prev in range(-current_max_sum, current_max_sum +1):

       if dp[s_prev + m] is 0, skip.

       else:

           for delta in (-1, 0, 1):

               s_new = s_prev + delta

               if s_new < -i or s_new > i:  (Wait, not sure. Since each step can add up to +1, the sum after i steps can't exceed i steps * 1. So for the i-th step (processing the i-th contributing position), the sum ranges from -i to i. So for the i-th step, s_prev can be from -(i-1) to (i-1). Adding delta can take s_new to -(i-1)-1 = -i to (i-1)+1 = i.

               So yes, for the i-th contributing position, the possible s_new ranges from -i to i.

               So in code, when processing the i-th position (for i in 1..m), the sum can be from -i to i. So the code can ignore any s_new that's out of this range? Or just let it be, since the next steps will have a larger range.

But since the list is of size 2m+1 (from -m to m), any sum s_new that is within the possible range for the current step (i) will be allowed.

So for each step, the possible s_prev ranges from -(i-1) to i-1. Then, for delta in (-1,0,1), s_new can be from -(i-1)-1 = -i to i-1 +1 = i.

Thus, for each step, the code can process all possible s_prev in the current dp, and for each delta, compute s_new and add to next_dp[s_new + m], considering the count for that delta.

But for each contributing position, the possible delta has a certain count:

For each delta, the number of ways to choose a_j that gives delta d is:

if delta is -1: 1 way (a_j = h[j])

delta is +1: 1 way (a_j = h[j+1])

delta is 0: k-2 ways (other options)

But wait, for each contributing position j, we need to know whether h[j] and h[j+1] are different, but that's already part of the selection (since j is in the m positions). So for each contributing position, the possible deltas are -1, 0, +1, with counts 1, (k-2), 1 respectively.

Wait no, for a contributing position j (h[j] != h[j+1]), when a_j is chosen as h[j], then contribution is -1. If a_j is h[j+1], contribution is +1. Otherwise, 0. So the counts for each delta:

delta = -1: 1 way.

delta = +1: 1 way.

delta = 0: (k - 2) ways.

Yes.

Thus, for each contributing position, the total possible ways for each delta is:

ways[-1] = 1

ways[0] = k-2

ways[1] = 1

Thus, in the DP transition, for each delta, we multiply the current count by the number of ways for that delta.

So, for each contributing position, the code will loop through all possible previous sums, and for each delta, add to the new sum the product of the previous count and the ways for delta.

Thus, the code will need to handle three transitions per previous sum.

Now, for implementing this in Python:

We can represent the dp as a list of size 2*m +1, where index s + m represents the sum s.

Initialize dp as all 0, except dp[m] = 1.

Then, for each step in m steps:

   create next_dp as all 0.

   for s_prev in the possible range (from -i+1 to i-1, where i is the current step count):

       if dp[s_prev + m] == 0: continue.

       for delta in (-1, 0, 1):

           s_new = s_prev + delta

           cnt = ways[delta] * dp[s_prev + m]

           next_dp[s_new + m] += cnt

           next_dp[s_new + m] %= MOD

   Then, dp = next_dp.

But in code, we need to loop through all possible s_prev that have a non-zero value in the current dp.

But how to do this efficiently? For each step, we can iterate over all possible s_prev in the current dp's indices where the value is non-zero, and process them.

But for m=2000, and each step having up to 2000*2 possible s_prev, this is manageable.

Alternatively, since the possible s_prev ranges from -i+1 to i-1 for step i, perhaps it's easier to loop through all possible s_prev in that range for each step.

But in Python, for efficiency, using list indices is better. For example, for each step i (from 0 to m-1), the current sum ranges can be from -i to i (since after i steps, the sum can be between -i and i).

Wait, no. Let's see:

For step 0 (no contributing positions processed), sum is 0.

For step 1 (processing the first contributing position), the sum can be -1, 0, +1.

For step 2, the sum can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

Wait, no. For example, in step 1, the possible sum is the initial sum (0) plus delta from the first contributing position (which can be -1, 0, +1). So the possible sums after step 1 are -1, 0, +1.

In step 2, each of those sums can have delta added again (-1, 0, +1). So possible sums after step 2 are:

-1-1 = -2

-1+0 = -1

-1+1 = 0

0-1 = -1

0+0 = 0

0+1 = 1

1-1 = 0

1+0 = 1

1+1 = 2

So possible sums after step 2 are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

Thus, after m steps, the possible sums are from -m to m.

So, for each step i (0-based up to m-1), the current sum can be from -(i+1) to (i+1). Because after processing the first i+1 contributing positions, the sum can be up to (i+1) (if all deltas are +1) or down to -(i+1) (if all are -1).

But for code, regardless of the steps, we can loop over all possible indices in the current dp array and process them if they have a non-zero count.

But for each contributing position, when we process it, the code can loop through all possible s_prev in the current dp's non-zero entries.

So here's the code outline:

MOD = 998244353

Read n, k.

h = list of h_i (1-based in input, but in code we'll use 0-based).

Compute m: for j in 0..n-1: check if h[j] != h[(j+1) % n]. Sum those.

c = n - m

base = pow(k, c, MOD)

if m == 0:

   # All positions are same as next, so shifting gives same array. So T = S, so no answer suits satisfy T > S. So output 0.

   print(0)

   exit()

Else:

   proceed with DP.

Initialize dp as array of size 2m +1, filled with 0. dp[m] = 1.

for each of the m contributing positions:

   create a new next_dp array filled with 0.

   for s_prev in range(-m, m+1):

       idx_prev = s_prev + m

       if dp[idx_prev] == 0:

           continue

       for delta in (-1, 0, 1):

           s_new = s_prev + delta

           idx_new = s_new + m

           if idx_new < 0 or idx_new >= len(next_dp):

               continue  # out of possible range?

           # calculate the count for this delta

           if delta == -1:

               cnt = 1

           elif delta == 1:

               cnt = 1

           else:

               cnt = (k - 2) % MOD

           next_dp[idx_new] = (next_dp[idx_new] + dp[idx_prev] * cnt) % MOD

   dp = next_dp

After processing all m positions:

sum over all s >0 in the dp array:

result = 0

for s in range(1, m+1):

   result += dp[s + m]

result %= MOD

Multiply by base (k^c mod MOD), and output.

But wait, the code for the transitions. For each contributing position, the possible delta's counts are 1, 1, and k-2 for delta -1, +1, 0 respectively.

But in code, for each of the m contributing positions, when delta is -1, the count is 1. When delta is +1, the count is 1. Else (delta 0), the count is k-2. So for each step, the code must multiply by these counts.

But in code, for each delta in (-1, 0, 1), what's the count:

For each delta:

if delta is -1 → 1 way.

if delta is +1 → 1 way.

else → (k-2) ways.

So in code:

ways = [1, (k-2) % MOD, 1]

Then, for delta in [-1, 0, 1], but the index here would be 0, 1, 2. Wait, perhaps code can use:

delta_values = [-1, 0, 1]

for delta in delta_values:

   if delta == -1:

       cnt = 1

   elif delta == 1:

       cnt = 1

   else:

       cnt = (k-2) % MOD

Alternatively, precompute for each delta in the list.

But in code, during each step, for each of the three possible deltas, compute the cnt.

But for each of the m steps, the same cnt is used for the three deltas.

So code can handle this.

Now, let's test this logic against the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3 3

1 3 1

h = [1,3,1]

Check each j (0-based):

j=0: h[0] =1, h[1] =3 → different → count.

j=1: h[1] =3, h[2] =1 → different → count.

j=2: h[2] =1, h[0] =1 → same → no.

So m=2.

c=3-2=1.

base = 3^1 mod MOD =3.

Now, for the DP:

m=2. So the dp array has size 5 (indices 0-4, representing sums -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

Processing m=2 steps.

Step 1 (first contributing position):

Initialize dp as [0,0,1,0,0] (sum 0 at index 2).

Processing first contributing position.

For s_prev in range -2 to 2 (but in current dp, only 0 is present).

So s_prev =0.

For each delta:

delta=-1:

s_new = -1 → index 1 (since -1 +2=1).

cnt = 1.

next_dp[1] += 1 *1 =1.

delta=0:

s_new=0 → index2. cnt is k-2 =1 (k=3 →3-2=1). So next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

delta=1:

s_new=1 → index3. cnt=1. next_dp[3] +=1*1=1.

After first step, next_dp is [0,1,1,1,0].

dp now becomes next_dp.

Step 2 (second contributing position):

Process each s_prev in the current dp.

Current dp is [0,1,1,1,0] (sums -1,0,1).

For each s_prev in [-1,0,1]:

For each delta:

s_prev = -1:

For delta=-1: s_new =-2 → index0. cnt=1. So next_dp[0] +=1 *1 =1.

delta=0: s_new =-1 → index1. cnt=1 (k-2=1). next_dp[1] +=1 *1 =1.

delta=1: s_new=0 → index2. cnt=1. next_dp[2] +=1 *1 =1.

s_prev=0:

delta=-1: s_new =-1 → index1. cnt=1. next_dp[1] +=1 *1 =1.

delta=0: s_new=0 → index2. cnt=1. next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

delta=1: s_new=1 → index3. cnt=1. next_dp[3] +=1*1=1.

s_prev=1:

delta=-1: s_new=0 → index2. cnt=1. next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

delta=0: s_new=1 → index3. cnt=1. next_dp[3] +=1*1=1.

delta=1: s_new=2 → index4. cnt=1. next_dp[4] +=1*1=1.

Now sum all contributions.

Let's compute next_dp:

For s_prev=-1:

delta=-1 → 0 → add 1.

delta=0 → 1 → add 1.

delta=1 → 2 → add 1.

So contributions for s_prev=-1:

next_dp[0] +=1 (sum -2)

next_dp[1] +=1 (sum -1)

next_dp[2] +=1 (sum 0)

s_prev=0:

delta=-1 → -1 → next_dp[1] +=1*1=1.

delta=0 →0 → next_dp[2] +=1.

delta=1 →1 → next_dp[3] +=1.

So next_dp[1] is 1 (from s_prev=-1) + 1 (s_prev=0) → 2.

next_dp[2] is 1 (s_prev=-1) +1 (s_prev=0) →2.

s_prev=1:

delta=-1 →0 → next_dp[2] +=1.

delta=0 →1 → next_dp[3] +=1.

delta=1 →2 → next_dp[4] +=1.

So next_dp[2] +=1 (from s_prev=1's delta=-1) → total next_dp[2] =2+1=3.

next_dp[3] +=1 (from s_prev=1's delta=0) → next_dp[3] =1 (from s_prev=0's delta=1) +1 (from s_prev=1's delta=0) =2.

next_dp[4] +=1.

So after processing all, next_dp is:

index 0: 1

index 1: 2 (1 from s_prev=-1's delta 0, and 1 from s_prev=0's delta -1?)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's redo:

After processing all s_prev in the current dp (which has s_prev = -1, 0, 1):

For each s_prev in [-1, 0, 1]:

s_prev =-1:

   for delta in [-1,0,1]:

       delta=-1: s_new =-2 → index 0. cnt=1. So next_dp[0] +=1 *1=1.

       delta=0: s_new =-1 → index1. cnt=1. next_dp[1] +=1*1=1.

       delta=1: s_new=0 → index2. cnt=1. next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

s_prev=0:

   for delta in [-1,0,1]:

       delta=-1: s_new=-1 → index1. next_dp[1] +=1*1=1.

       delta=0: s_new=0 → index2. next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

       delta=1: s_new=1 → index3. next_dp[3] +=1*1=1.

s_prev=1:

   for delta in [-1,0,1]:

       delta=-1: s_new=0 → index2. next_dp[2] +=1*1=1.

       delta=0: s_new=1 → index3. next_dp[3] +=1*1=1.

       delta=1: s_new=2 → index4. next_dp[4] +=1*1=1.

Thus:

next_dp[0] =1

next_dp[1] =1 (from s_prev=-1, delta 0) +1 (from s_prev=0, delta-1) → total 2.

next_dp[2] =1 (s_prev=-1, delta1) +1 (s_prev=0, delta0) +1 (s_prev=1, delta-1) →3.

next_dp[3] =1 (s_prev=0, delta1) +1 (s_prev=1, delta0) →2.

next_dp[4] =1 (s_prev=1, delta1).

So after step 2, the next_dp is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1].

But wait, the current sum after two steps can be:

-2: 1 way

-1: 2 ways

0:3 ways

1:2 ways

2:1 way.

Now, we need to sum all s >0, which are 1 and 2.

sum of dp[3] (s=1) and dp[4] (s=2): 2+1=3.

Multiply by base (3) → 3*3=9 → which matches the sample output.

Yes, this works.

So the code seems correct.

Now, handling the case where k is 1. Wait, if k=1, then all a's are 1. So for each position, a_j can only be 1. But the code must handle this.

But for k=1, for a contributing position j (h[j] != h[j+1]), the possible choices for a_j are 1. But in this case, if h[j] is 1, then delta would be -1 (if h[j+1] is not 1), but wait, since h[j] != h[j+1], and a_j is 1 (since k=1), then:

if h[j] is 1: then a_j == h[j] → delta is -1 (since h[j+1] is not 1, so a_j != h[j+1], so [a_j == h[j+1}] is 0. So contribution is 0-1 = -1.

But if h[j] is not 1, then a_j (which must be 1) is not equal to h[j], so contribution is 0-0=0? Wait no.

Wait, when k=1, all a_j are 1. So for a contributing position j (h[j] != h[j+1]):

if a_j is 1, then:

- if h[j] is 1: then contribution is (1 == h[j+1} ? 0 (since h[j] != h[j+1} → h[j+1} is not 1. So [a_j == h[j+1}] is 0. So contribution is 0 -1 =-1.

- if h[j] is not 1: then [a_j == h[j}] is 0, and [a_j == h[j+1}] is 1 if h[j+1} is 1, else 0. So if h[j+1} is 1, then contribution is 1-0 =1. Else, 0-0=0.

But in this case, when k=1, a_j is 1. So for contributing positions j, the delta is:

if h[j] is 1 → then contribution is -1 (since h[j+1} is not 1, so a_j (1) != h[j+1}.

if h[j+1} is 1 → then contribution is 1 (a_j is 1 ==h[j+1}).

else → contribution is 0.

But in code, when k=1, the code would have for each contributing position:

ways for delta=-1: 1 (but a_j is 1. So this only applies if h[j] is 1 and h[j+1} is not 1.

ways for delta=1: 1 (if h[j+1} is 1 and h[j} is not 1.

Else, the delta would be 0 (if both h[j] and h[j+1} are not 1, but since k=1, a_j is 1, so [a_j == h[j}] is 0 and [a_j ==h[j+1}] is 0, so delta 0.

But in code, when k=1, the code will set cnt for delta=0 as (k-2) = -1 mod MOD (which is 998244352). But when k=1, (k-2) is -1, which mod 998244353 is 998244352. However, in reality, for a contributing position j (h[j] != h[j+1}), a_j must be 1. So the code would compute delta as:

for a_j=1:

   if h[j] ==1 → delta is -1 (since h[j+1} !=1, so a_j ==h[j} gives 1, and a_j ==h[j+1} gives 0. So 0-1 =-1.

   else if h[j+1} ==1 → delta is +1 (a_j ==h[j+1} gives 1, a_j ==h[j} gives 0 →1-0=1.

   else → delta 0 (both terms are 0).

But when k=1, the code's approach of considering delta's possibilities (for contributing positions) as -1, 0, or 1 with counts 1, k-2, 1 would not be correct. Because when k=1, for contributing positions j, a_j is fixed to 1. So for those positions, the delta is determined by the values of h[j] and h[j+1}.

But the code's logic would compute the possible deltas as follows:

for each contributing position j:

ways for delta=-1 is 1, ways for delta=0 is k-2 (which is -1 mod MOD), ways for delta=1 is 1.

But when k=1, the code's approach would calculate:

for delta=-1: 1 way.

delta=0: 998244352 ways.

delta=1: 1 way.

But in reality, for k=1, a_j can only be 1. So for each contributing position j, the delta is determined by whether a_j (1) matches h[j} or h[j+1}.

But the code's logic would multiply the cnt for delta=-1, 0, or 1 by 1, 998244352, or 1, respectively. Which would not be correct. For example, when k=1, the code would allow delta=0, but in reality, a_j can only be 1, which may not lead to delta=0.

So the code would not handle k=1 correctly.

Wait, but according to the problem statement's constraints, k can be up to 1e9. So the code must handle k=1.

Hmm, this is a problem. The code's logic works when for contributing positions j, the delta is allowed to be -1, 0, or +1, and the counts are 1, k-2, 1.

But when k=1, the code would allow for a contributing position j:

delta=-1:1 way (a_j=1, which equals h[j} only if h[j}=1, and h[j+1} is not 1.

But wait, the code's approach doesn't consider the actual h[j} and h[j+1} for each contributing position. It assumes that for each contributing position, the possible deltas are -1, 0, +1, with counts 1, k-2, 1.

But this is incorrect when k is less than 2. For example, when k=1, the code allows a_j to be h[j} (delta=-1) or h[j+1} (delta=+1), but when k=1, a_j can only be 1. So if h[j} is 3 and h[j+1} is 5 (contributing position), then a_j=1, so delta is 0 (since a_j != h[j} and a_j !=h[j+1}).

But according to the code's logic, when k=1, for delta=0, the count is k-2= -1 mod MOD. So the code would multiply by 998244352 ways for delta=0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code's logic is flawed for k <2.

But why? Because for k=1, there is only one possible a_j, which is 1. So the code's approach of considering all three possibilities is incorrect.

But the problem statement says that k can be up to 1e9, and in the sample inputs, k=3 and 5. So how to handle cases where k is less than 2?

This suggests that the code's approach has a flaw for k < 2.

So, let's think.

When k=1:

All a_j must be 1.

For a contributing position j (h[j] != h[j+1}):

a_j=1.

So, delta is:

-1 if 1 ==h[j} and 1 !=h[j+1}.

+1 if 1 ==h[j+1} and 1 !=h[j}.

0 otherwise.

But since h[j} !=h[j+1}, the third case is when 1 is neither h[j} nor h[j+1}.

So for each contributing position j, the delta can be -1, 0, or +1, but the counts are not 1, k-2, 1. Instead, the count is 1 if a_j=1 leads to that delta.

But when k=1, the code's approach would multiply by (k-2) for delta 0, but when k=1, this is -1 mod MOD.

But in reality, for each contributing position j, there's exactly one choice for a_j (1), which gives exactly one delta. So the code's approach would be wrong.

This is a problem. So how to handle this?

The code's current approach assumes that for each contributing position j (h[j} !=h[j+1}), the a_j can be chosen in three possible ways: choose h[j} (delta-1), choose h[j+1} (delta+1), or choose something else (delta 0). But when k <2, there are no "something else" options. For k=1, the only option is 1. So in this case, the code's approach is incorrect.

Thus, the code's logic is valid only when k >=2. But for k=1, we need to handle it separately.

So, let's think: what if k=1?

In that case, all a_j are 1. So the answer depends on the sum of their contributions.

For each contributing position j:

a_j=1.

So:

delta = (1 ==h[j+1}) - (1 ==h[j}).

So the total sum is sum of delta_j for all contributing positions j.

If the sum is >0, then the answer is 1 multiplied by k^c (which is 1^c=1).

Otherwise, 0.

So, when k=1, the answer is 1 if the sum of delta_j (for all contributing positions) is >0, else 0.

But delta_j for each contributing position is:

delta_j = [1 ==h[j+1}] - [1 ==h[j}].

So, the sum is sum over all j in contributing positions of ( [1 ==h[j+1}] - [1 ==h[j}] )).

But each contributing position j is where h[j} !=h[j+1}.

So, for k=1, the code can be handled as a special case.

Thus, the code needs to check if k is 1 and handle it separately.

So, the revised steps:

- Compute m and c as before.

- If k ==1:

   then, all a_j are 1. So compute the sum of delta_j for all contributing positions.

   sum_d = sum( (1 == h[(j+1) %n ]) - (1 == h[j]) for j in contributing_positions )

   if sum_d >0: answer is 1 * (k^c) mod MOD → 1.

   else: 0.

Else:

   proceed with the DP approach.

So, in code:

Handle k=1 as a special case.

This way, the code can handle all cases.

Similarly, when k=0 is possible, but according to the constraints, k >=1.

So, the code should first check if k ==1, and handle accordingly.

This solves the problem with k=1.

Now, let's think about other cases where k <2, but in the problem statement, the constraints say 1 <=k <=1e9. So k can be 1.

Thus, the code must include this special case.

Now, let's adjust the code to handle this.

In code:

Read n, k.

h = list(map(int, input().split()))[1] → wait, no: the second line is the h list.

Then, compute m.

If k ==1:

   compute sum_d for all contributing positions j.

   sum_d = sum( (h[j+1] ==1) - (h[j] ==1) for j in contributing_positions )

   if sum_d >0:

       ans = pow(1, c, MOD)

   else:

       ans =0

   print(ans)

   exit()

Else:

   proceed with DP.

But how to find the contributing positions?

Alternatively, for code:

Compute m by checking each j in 0..n-1 whether h[j] !=h[(j+1)%n].

Then, when k==1:

   sum_d = 0

   for j in 0..n-1:

       if h[j] !=h[(j+1)%n]:

           sum_d += ( (h[(j+1)%n] ==1) - (h[j] ==1) )

   if sum_d >0:

       ans = 1 (since k^c is 1^c =1)

   else:

       ans=0

   print(ans % MOD)

   exit()

Else:

   proceed with DP.

Thus, the code handles k=1 as a special case.

This ensures that for k=1, the code works correctly.

So, the code now has the following steps:

Read n, k.

Read h list.

Compute the contributing positions.

Compute m and c.

If k ==1:

   compute sum_d.

   if sum_d >0 → ans =1 * (1^c) mod MOD → 1.

   else → 0.

   print ans.

Else:

   proceed with the DP approach.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, another edge case: when m=0. For example, all positions have h[j} == h[j+1}.

In this case, the sum is 0. So T-S=0. So no answer suits satisfy T>S. So ans is 0.

The code already checks m==0 and returns 0.

So the code handles this.

Another test case:

n=1, k=5, h = [3].

In this case, j=0: h[j+1] is h[0%1=0} → h[0] =3 ==3. So m=0. So ans is 0.

Another case: n=2, k=1.

h = [1, 2].

contributing positions: j=0 (h[0]=1 !=h[1}=2), j=1 (h[1}=2 !=h[0}=1). So m=2.

sum_d for each j:

j=0: h[j+1}=2 → ==1? No. So delta_j is 0 -1 =-1.

j=1: h[j+1}=1 → ==1? Yes. So delta_j is 1 -0 =1.

sum_d =-1 +1=0 → not >0. So ans is 0.

Thus, code returns 0.

Thus, the code handles these cases.

Finally, the code must be written with these considerations.

Now, time to code this.

The code outline is:

Read n, k.

h = list of integers.

Compute m = number of j where h[j] != h[(j+1) %n].

c = n -m.

if k ==1:

   sum_d =0

   for j in 0..n-1:

       if h[j] != h[(j+1)%n]:

           delta = (h[(j+1)%n] ==1) - (h[j] ==1)

           sum_d += delta

   if sum_d >0:

       print(1 % MOD)

   else:

       print(0)

   exit()

else:

   compute base = pow(k, c, MOD)

   if m ==0:

       print(0)

       exit()

   proceed with DP.

   MOD = 998244353

   max_offset = m

   dp = [0]*(2*m +1)

   dp[m] =1

   for each of the m contributing positions:

       next_dp = [0]*(2*m +1)

       for s_prev in range(-m, m+1):

           idx_prev = s_prev + m

           if dp[idx_prev] ==0:

               continue

           for delta in (-1, 0, 1):

               s_new = s_prev + delta

               idx_new = s_new + m

               if idx_new <0 or idx_new >= 2*m +1:

                   continue

               if delta ==-1 or delta ==1:

                   cnt =1

               else:

                   cnt = (k-2) % MOD

               next_dp[idx_new] = (next_dp[idx_new] + dp[idx_prev] * cnt) % MOD

       dp = next_dp

   # compute the sum of s>0.

   total =0

   for s in range(1, m+1):

       total += dp[s +m]

   total %= MOD

   ans = (total * base) % MOD

   print(ans)

But wait, in code, the contributing positions are m in number, but the code processes m steps regardless of which positions are contributing. But the contributing positions are those where h[j] != h[j+1} mod n. However, the code's DP approach doesn't process each contributing position's actual h[j] and h[j+1}. It assumes that for each contributing position, the possible deltas are -1, 0, +1 with counts 1, k-2, 1. This is correct when h[j} and h[j+1} are different, which they are for contributing positions.

Thus, the code is correct.

So, the code is:

Now, code in Python:

Testing against sample input 1.

Sample 2:

5 5

1 1 4 2 2

h is [1,1,4,2,2]

Check contributing positions:

j=0: 1 vs 1 → same. no.

j=1: 1 vs 4 → different. yes.

j=2:4 vs2 → yes.

j=3:2 vs2 → same. no.

j=4:2 vs1 → yes.

Wait, j=4: h[4] =2, next_j=0 → h[0] =1 → 2 !=1 → yes.

So m=3 (j=1,2,4).

c=5-3=2.

base=5^2=25.

Then, m=3.

So the DP steps.

But in the sample, the output is 1000.

But the code's output is (sum of dp[s>0]) * 25.

But I'm not going to compute the DP steps for this case.

But the code should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code should be correct.
