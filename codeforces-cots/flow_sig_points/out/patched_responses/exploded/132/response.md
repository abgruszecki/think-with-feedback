<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So Anya needs to have at least r candles burning each time a ghost visits. Each ghost comes at a specific second wi, and each visit lasts exactly one second. The candles burn for t seconds once lit, but take 1 second to light. So if you start lighting a candle at time x, it will be burning from x+1 to x+t inclusive. 

The goal is to find the minimum number of candles needed such that for every wi, there are at least r candles burning during that second. If it's impossible, output -1.

First, I need to check if it's possible. Let's think about the constraints. For a single ghost at wi, the earliest time a candle can be lit to cover wi is (wi - t), because if you light it at wi - t, it burns from (wi - t +1) to (wi - t + t) = wi. So to cover wi, a candle must be lit at time x where x +1 <= wi <= x + t. So x can be as early as (wi - t), and as late as (wi - 1). Because if you light it at wi, it starts burning at wi+1, which is after the ghost's visit.

But wait, the problem says that when you light a candle at time x, it takes 1 second, and starts burning from x+1. So for the ghost's visit at wi, the candle needs to be burning during wi. That means the candle's interval [x+1, x+t] must include wi. So x+1 <= wi <= x+t. Rearranged: x <= wi-1 and x >= wi - t. So x must be in [wi - t, wi - 1]. So for each wi, the possible times to light a candle are between wi - t and wi-1, inclusive. 

But each candle takes 1 second to light. So if you light multiple candles, you have to account for the time taken to light them. For example, if Anya starts lighting a candle at time x, she can't start another until x+1. So the times when she lights candles must be consecutive? Or maybe overlapping? Wait, no. Each lighting takes exactly 1 second. So Anya can only light one candle per second. So the times when she lights candles are all distinct, and each is one second apart.

So the problem is to select a set of times (candles' lighting times) such that for each wi, there are at least r candles that were lit in [wi - t, wi - 1], and also, the lighting times are such that no two are overlapping (since each takes 1 second). But wait, no. Because lighting a candle is an action that starts at time x, takes 1 second. So the next candle can be started at x+1. So the times must be in distinct, consecutive or non-overlapping intervals. So the times when candles are lit must be in a sequence of x, x+1, etc. So each candle's lighting time is a unique second.

But how do the lighting times affect each other? For example, if Anya starts lighting a candle at time x, then she can't start another until x+1. So the lighting times must be distinct and can't overlap. So each candle is lit at a distinct time. So the set of lighting times is a set of distinct integers. 

The challenge is to arrange these lighting times such that for every wi, there are at least r times in the set that are in [wi - t, wi - 1], and the total number of candles is minimized.

Now, the problem is similar to covering each wi with r candles in their possible intervals, and selecting these times optimally to minimize the total.

But how to model this? Let's think about the earliest possible way to light candles. For example, for a ghost at wi, the latest possible time to light a candle that covers wi is wi -1. If we light a candle at wi-1, it will cover wi. But if there's another ghost at wi+1, and t is large enough, that candle might also cover wi+1. So overlapping coverage is possible.

So the key is to schedule the lighting times in such a way that a single candle's coverage (its burning time) covers as many wi's as possible. This would minimize the total number of candles.

But given that each candle's lighting takes a second, and each candle's coverage is t seconds, we need to arrange the candles so that their coverage overlaps as much as possible.

Let's think about the sample input:

First sample:
1 8 3
10

We need at least 3 candles burning at time 10. Each candle burns for 8 seconds. So the earliest possible time to light a candle is 10-8 = 2 (since 2+8 >=10, but wait, let's compute the interval. If lit at 2, the candle is burning from 3 to 10 inclusive. So yes, covers 10. So for wi=10, possible x's are 2 to 9. But each candle takes 1 second to light, so the times when Anya can light them are 2,3,4,...,9. But each time she lights a candle, she uses one second. So to have 3 candles, she can light them at 2,3,4. Then each will burn until 10, 11, 12, etc. But the ghost is at 10, so the first candle (lit at 2) covers 3-10 (including 10). The second at 3: 4-11. But the ghost is only at 10. So all 3 candles are burning at 10. So that's 3 candles.

So in this case, the answer is 3.

But the sample shows that lighting them at 3,5,7. Let's see: each candle's burning period:

3: lit at 3 → 4-11 (covers 10)
5: 6-13 (covers 10)
7: 8-15 (covers 10)
So all three are burning at 10. So that's 3 candles. So the total is 3.

So the minimal number is achieved by spreading them out in the possible interval.

But why can't we light them all at 9, 8, 7? Let's see:

If t=8, then a candle lit at 9 would burn from 10-17. So that covers 10. But if you light three candles at 7,8,9:

7: 8-15 → covers 10
8:9-16 → covers 10
9:10-17 → covers 10. So three candles. So same number.

So the minimal is three. So the order or positions don't matter as long as they are in the required interval for each ghost.

But the main point is that each candle can cover one ghost's time. Wait, no. Because a single candle can cover multiple ghosts. For example, if a ghost comes at 10 and another at 15, and t is 10. Then a candle lit at 5 would burn from 6-15. So it covers both 10 and 15. So that's useful.

So the problem is to arrange the candles such that each ghost has at least r candles covering it, and the total number of candles is minimized.

So the approach is to find a way to select times for the candles such that each wi has at least r candles whose intervals [x+1, x+t] include wi, and the number of candles is minimized.

But how to model this?

This feels like a greedy problem. Let's think of processing the ghosts in order. For each ghost, assign as many candles as needed, but possibly reusing previous candles.

But since the ghosts are given in strictly increasing order, perhaps we can process them in order and greedily assign the latest possible lighting times for the candles, so that they can cover as many subsequent ghosts as possible.

Alternatively, for each ghost, we can track the earliest times that the candles must be lit to cover it, and then check if there are overlapping intervals where existing candles can cover multiple ghosts.

But when r is more than 1, this becomes more complex.

Let's think of each ghost's requirement: for wi, we need at least r candles that were lit in [wi-t, wi-1]. So each such candle contributes to covering wi. But a candle lit at x can cover all ghosts whose wi is in [x+1, x+t]. So if there are multiple ghosts in this interval, the same candle covers all of them.

So the optimal approach is to arrange the candles such that each candle covers as many ghosts as possible, thereby reducing the total number needed.

But given that each ghost requires r candles, we need to have for each wi, r candles that include wi in their intervals.

Let's consider the constraints:

If for any wi, the time window [wi-t, wi-1] has less than r possible times (i.e., (wi-1) - (wi-t) + 1 < r) → that is, the window size is t seconds. So if t < r, then it's impossible. Wait, because the window has length t. For example, t=5 → window is 5 seconds. So maximum possible candles that can cover a wi is 5. So if r>5, it's impossible. So in this case, the answer is -1.

Wait, no. Let's see. For each wi, the earliest time is wi-t, the latest is wi-1. The number of possible times is (wi-1) - (wi - t) + 1 = t. So if t < r, then even if all possible times are used (which is t candles), they can't provide r candles for that wi. Hence, the answer is impossible. So first, we can check if for any wi, the required r is larger than t. If yes, output -1.

Wait, wait. For example, if t=3 and r=4. Then for any wi, the window is [wi-3, wi-1], which is 3 seconds. So maximum possible candles for that wi is 3. So if r=4, it's impossible. So in this case, the answer is -1 regardless of the other parameters.

So the first check is: if for any wi, the number of possible times (t) is less than r, then output -1. But since all wi's are distinct, but their windows may vary. Wait, no. Wait, the window for wi is [wi -t, wi -1]. So the length of the window is (wi-1) - (wi -t) +1 = t. So for any wi, the window has exactly t possible times. So if t < r, then it's impossible. Because even if we light all t candles in the window, they can't reach r. So in that case, output -1.

Wait, but for example, in the third sample input:

1 1 3

The window for wi=10 is [10-1, 10-1] → [9,9], so length 1. Since r=3, it's impossible. So output is -1.

So the first thing to check is whether t >= r. Because if t < r, then even if all possible times in the window are used, it's not enough. So for the problem, if t < r, the answer is -1.

So the first step in the code is to check if r > t. If yes, return -1. Otherwise, proceed.

So, if t >= r, then for each wi, the window has at least r possible times. But that's necessary but not sufficient, because the candles need to be lit in those windows, but also the lighting times must be possible given that each takes 1 second and Anya can't light two candles in the same second.

So even if t >= r, it's possible that the windows for different ghosts are overlapping in such a way that they require more than the available time.

So, for example, suppose m=2, t=3, r=2. The ghosts are at 5 and 8. The windows are [5-3=2,4] and [8-3=5,7]. Suppose we need 2 candles for each. Let's say the first ghost's window is 2,3,4. The second's is 5,6,7. So if we light two candles in 4 and 3 (for the first ghost), they can't cover the second. So we need two more candles in the second's window, totaling 4. But perhaps there's a way to have some candles cover both.

Wait, the first ghost is at 5. So candles lit in 2,3,4 will cover 5. The second ghost is at 8. So candles lit in 5,6,7 will cover 8. So no overlap. So total of 4. But maybe there's a way to have a candle in 4, which covers 5 (since 4+1=5, and t=3, so covers 5-7. So the first ghost is at 5, covered. The second at 8. 5 is covered by 4's candle (5-7), but 8 is not. So no. So perhaps, we need 2 candles for each ghost. But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can light some candles in the overlapping windows.

Wait, in this example, let's see:

If the first ghost is at 5, window [2,4], and the second at 8, window [5,7]. So no overlapping windows. So each requires two candles. So total of 4.

But what if there's a ghost at 6 and another at 7, t=3. Then their windows are [3,5] and [4,6]. So overlapping. Then a candle lit at 5 can cover both (since 5+1=6, 6,7,8 → covers ghost at 6 (if 6 is the ghost's time), but depends on the actual wi.

So overlapping windows allow for candles to cover multiple ghosts.

So the problem becomes finding a way to select a set of times such that each time's interval covers some of the wi's, and each wi is covered by at least r times. And the total number of times is minimized.

But how to model this.

An approach that comes to mind is to model this as an interval covering problem with multiple coverage requirements.

Each candle's time x is a point that contributes coverage to all wi in [x+1, x + t]. Each wi must be covered by at least r such points. We need to select a minimal number of x's.

But the x's must be such that they are distinct (since each takes 1 second to light).

But even more, the x's must form a sequence of non-overlapping times (since each takes exactly 1 second to light. So Anya can't light two candles in the same second. But she can light one per second. So the x's can be any distinct integers, but their order is not a problem because she can light them in any order. Wait, no: the time when she lights the candles can be in any order, but each takes 1 second. So for example, she can light a candle at time 5, then another at 3, but that would require the time sequence to be 3, then 5 (but that's allowed, as she can choose to light them in any order). However, the problem says that the times are when the candle is lit. So the x's can be any integers, but they must be distinct. So the order in which they are lit is irrelevant; the important thing is that each x is a unique time.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to choosing a set of x's (distinct integers) such that for each wi, there are at least r x's in [wi - t, wi - 1], and the total number of x's is minimized.

So the problem is to select the minimal number of x's such that each wi has at least r x's in its window [wi-t, wi-1].

Now, the question is: how to select these x's optimally.

The first thing is to check if any wi's window [wi-t, wi-1] is such that the window has length t (since it's [wi-t, wi-1], which is t elements). So if t < r, then even if all possible x's in the window are selected, it's impossible. Hence, the answer is -1. So the first check is: if t < r, output -1.

Otherwise, proceed.

Now, assuming t >= r.

The next idea is to process the ghosts in order (they are given in strictly increasing order) and greedily assign candles in the latest possible positions. This way, each candle can cover as many subsequent ghosts as possible.

For example, if a candle is placed at x, it can cover all ghosts in [x+1, x+t]. Since the ghosts are in increasing order, placing x as late as possible (but within the earliest ghost's window) may allow the candle to cover more ghosts.

So here's a possible approach:

For each ghost wi, we need to have at least r candles in [wi -t, wi -1]. We can process the ghosts in order, and for each wi, check how many of the required r candles have already been placed (i.e., are in [wi -t, wi -1]). The remaining needed candles are placed as late as possible in the window. This way, these candles can potentially cover subsequent ghosts.

This approach is similar to the one used in interval covering where you select the latest possible point to maximize coverage.

So here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Check if t < r → output -1.

2. Sort the ghosts' times (though the input says they are already given in strictly increasing order, so perhaps we can skip sorting).

3. For each ghost wi in order:

   a. Determine the window [start, end] = [wi - t, wi -1].

   b. Count how many candles are already present in this window.

   c. If the count is less than r, we need to add (r - count) candles.

   d. Place these new candles at the latest possible positions in the window, i.e., from end downwards, but not overlapping with existing candles.

   e. Add these new candles to the set.

This way, for each ghost, we ensure that there are at least r candles in its window, and by placing new candles as late as possible, we maximize their coverage for future ghosts.

Let's see how this works with the first sample:

Sample 1:
m=1, t=8, r=3
wi =10.

Check t >= r → 8 >=3 → yes.

The window is [10-8=2, 9]. The window has 8 elements. No existing candles. Need to add 3. So place them as late as possible: 9, 8,7. But adding 9,8,7 would cover the window. Each of these is in the window.

These three candles would then burn until 9+8=17 (starts at 10). So during wi=10, they are burning. So correct.

Another example:

Sample 2:
m=2, t=10, r=1
ghosts at 5 and 8.

t >=r →10 >=1 → yes.

Process first ghost (5):

window is 5-10= -5? Wait, wait. Wait, wi=5. The window is [5-10, 5-1] → [-5,4]. So start is -5, end is 4.

But we need to place 1 candle here. The latest possible is 4. So add 4. Now, check the second ghost at 8.

window is [8-10= -2, 7]. The existing candle at 4 is in this window. So count is 1, which is >= r=1. So no need to add more.

So total is 1.

But in the sample, the answer is 1, which is correct. The candle can be lit at time -1 (like one second before midnight), which is in the window for 5 (since 5's window is [-5,4]. So 4 is in that window. But then, for the ghost at 5, the candle lit at 4 is in the window. For the ghost at 8, the window is [-2,7]. So 4 is in that window. So the candle at 4 covers both 5 and 8. So that's why only one candle is needed.

So this approach works.

Another example:

Sample 3:

m=1, t=1, r=3. The window is [10-1,9] → [9,9]. So t=1. Since r=3 >1, output -1.

Which matches the sample.

So this approach seems to work.

Now, how to implement this.

We can keep track of the candles we have lit so far. For each new ghost, check how many of the current candles are in its window. If less than r, add the remaining ones at the latest possible positions in the window, ensuring they are not already in the candles set.

But how to track the candles. Since the ghosts are processed in order, and the candles are added latest first, perhaps we can represent the candles as a sorted list, and for each new window, check how many candles are in that window, then add the needed ones.

But since the list is sorted, we can perform binary search to find the count.

Alternatively, since the ghosts are processed in order, and the windows for the ghosts are also in order (since wi is increasing), perhaps the candles are added in a way that can be processed efficiently.

Let's think of the steps:

Initialize a list of candles (sorted in ascending order).

For each wi in the sorted list of ghosts:

   Determine the window [start, end] = [wi - t, wi -1]

   The required number of candles in this window is r.

   Now, count how many existing candles are in [start, end].

   If count >= r → do nothing.

   Else → need to add (r - count) candles.

   The new candles should be placed in the window's end as much as possible. So the latest possible positions in [start, end], which are not already in the candles list.

   So for example, for the window [start, end], the latest possible positions are end, end-1, ..., end - (r - count -1). But we need to check if those positions are not already taken.

Wait, but how do we check if those positions are available? Because the candles list is a set, and we can check if a position is already in the set.

So for the window [start, end], the new positions to add are the maximum possible positions within the window, starting from end downwards, and not already in the candles.

So for example:

Current candles in the window: 4. Need to add 3 more. The window is [2,9]. So try to add 9,8,7. If any of those are already in the candles, skip to the next lower. But since the candles list is a set, and we are adding new ones, perhaps we can just add the positions starting from end downwards, as many as needed.

But wait, the candles that are already in the window may be in positions that are not in the latest positions. For example, suppose existing candles are at 3,4,5. Window is [2,9]. So count is 3. If r=5, then we need to add 2 more. So we add 9 and 8. Now the total is 5.

But how to avoid overlapping with existing candles.

So the steps are:

For each needed candle (r - count times):

   Find the latest possible position in the window that is not already in the candles.

   Add that position to the candles.

But how to efficiently find those positions.

Wait, since the window is [start, end], and we want to add as many as possible starting from end and going backwards, but skipping positions that are already in the candles.

But if the candles are stored in a sorted list, we can perform a binary search to find the latest position in the window that is not already present.

Alternatively, since the candles are sorted, we can iterate from end downwards, and for each position check if it's present.

But for each addition, checking each position from end down to start might be time-consuming if the window is large. But given the constraints (m and t up to 300), even for the worst case, this is manageable.

So let's outline the algorithm:

Initialize a list of candles (sorted, perhaps a list maintained in sorted order, or a set, but sorted list is better for binary search).

For each wi in the sorted list of ghosts:

   start = wi - t

   end = wi -1

   required = r

   # count how many candles are in [start, end]

   # using binary search on the sorted candles list:

   left = first index >= start

   right = last index <= end

   count = right - left + 1 (if elements exist in that range)

   if count >= required: continue

   else:

       need = required - count

       # now, need to add 'need' candles in [start, end], as late as possible.

       # start from end and move backward.

       added = 0

       current_pos = end

       while added < need and current_pos >= start:

           if current_pos is not in candles:

               add current_pos to candles (and keep the list sorted)

               added +=1

           current_pos -=1

       if added < need:

           # there are not enough positions in the window to add the required candles.

           return -1

After processing all ghosts, return the total number of candles.

Wait, but this approach may fail in some cases where adding candles in the current window may overwrite candles needed for previous ghosts. But since the ghosts are processed in order, and each is considered in their own window, perhaps not. Let's see.

But why would that be the case? For example, suppose a previous ghost's window overlaps with the current window. However, since the current ghost is processed later, the candles added for the current ghost may have already covered some of the previous ghosts. But since the previous ghosts' requirements were already satisfied, adding new candles in the current window does not affect them. Because each ghost is processed in order, and when we process a ghost, we ensure that at least r candles are in its window. So previous ghosts may have their own candles in their own windows, and the current candles are added in the current window. But since the current window may overlap with future ghosts, the candles added here can cover future ghosts.

Wait, but the algorithm processes ghosts in the order they arrive. The current ghost's window may have some positions that are also in the windows of future ghosts. So by placing candles as late as possible in the current window, those candles can cover future ghosts.

This is exactly the desired behavior, because it maximizes the chance that the candles will cover future ghosts, thus reducing the total number needed.

So the algorithm is:

- For each ghost in order, check its window. If not enough candles in the window, add the needed candles as late as possible (starting from end of window and moving backwards). This way, the added candles are as late as possible, hence their intervals [x+1, x+t] are as far to the right as possible, covering as many future ghosts as possible.

This approach should work.

Now, the implementation steps:

1. Read m, t, r.

2. Check if r > t → output -1.

3. Read the list of wi's, which are already sorted in strictly increasing order.

4. Initialize a sorted list of candles (empty at the beginning).

5. For each wi in wi's list:

   a. Compute start = wi - t, end = wi-1.

   b. Count how many candles are in the [start, end] interval.

   c. needed = max(0, r - count)

   d. For needed times:

       i. Try to add candles starting from 'end' and moving backward.

       ii. For each possible position from end downto start:

           if the position is not in the candles list, add it.

           until needed candles are added.

       iii. If during this process, not enough positions are found (i.e., tried all positions from end downto start and could not find enough new positions), then output -1.

   e. Add the new candles to the list (keeping it sorted for efficient binary search next time).

6. If all ghosts are processed successfully, output the total number of candles.

Now, the key is to efficiently count the number of candles in the current window and to add new candles in the correct positions.

Implementing this in Python.

But how to manage the sorted list of candles.

In Python, we can keep the list sorted, and for each new insertion, find the correct position using bisect.insort.

For counting the number of candles in [start, end], we can use bisect_left and bisect_right.

For example:

candles is a list sorted in ascending order.

left = bisect.bisect_left(candles, start)

right = bisect.bisect_right(candles, end)

count = right - left

So that's efficient.

When adding new candles, we can iterate from end down to start, and for each position not in the list, add it. But how to check if a position is already in the list? Since the list is sorted, we can use bisect.bisect_left to find the insertion point and check if the element exists.

So for current_pos in range(end, start-1, -1):

   index = bisect.bisect_left(candles, current_pos)

   if index < len(candles) and candles[index] == current_pos:

       continue (already present)

   else:

       insert current_pos into candles at index.

       added +=1

But this is O(n) for each insertion. But given that m and t are up to 300, and each insertion is O(n), this is acceptable.

But in the worst case, for each ghost, you process 300 steps, and m is 300. So 300*300 = 90,000 steps. Which is manageable.

So code outline:

import bisect

m, t, r = map(int, input().split())
ghosts = list(map(int, input().split()))

if r > t:
    print(-1)
    exit()

candles = []
total = 0

for wi in ghosts:
    start = wi - t
    end = wi -1

    left = bisect.bisect_left(candles, start)
    right = bisect.bisect_right(candles, end)
    count = right - left

    needed = r - count
    if needed <=0:
        continue

    added = 0
    current_pos = end
    while added < needed and current_pos >= start:
        # Check if current_pos is already in candles
        idx = bisect.bisect_left(candles, current_pos)
        if idx < len(candles) and candles[idx] == current_pos:
            # present, skip
            current_pos -=1
            continue
        # insert into candles
        bisect.insort(candles, current_pos)
        added +=1
        total +=1
        current_pos -=1

    if added < needed:
        print(-1)
        exit()

print(total)

Wait, but the code needs to track the total number of candles. Because the candles list's length is the total.

So perhaps, instead of tracking the total, we can just return len(candles) at the end. But during insertion, each insertion adds to the candles list. So after processing all ghosts, return len(candles). But in the code above, the 'total' variable is incremented by 'added' each time. But perhaps it's easier to just track the candles list.

So, the code can be modified as:

import bisect

m, t, r = map(int, input().split())
ghosts = list(map(int, input().split()))

if r > t:
    print(-1)
    exit()

candles = []

for wi in ghosts:
    start = wi - t
    end = wi -1

    left = bisect.bisect_left(candles, start)
    right = bisect.bisect_right(candles, end)
    count = right - left

    needed = r - count
    if needed <=0:
        continue

    added = 0
    current_pos = end
    while added < needed and current_pos >= start:
        idx = bisect.bisect_left(candles, current_pos)
        if idx < len(candles) and candles[idx] == current_pos:
            current_pos -=1
            continue
        bisect.insort(candles, current_pos)
        added +=1
        current_pos -=1

    if added < needed:
        print(-1)
        exit()

print(len(candles))

This should work.

Testing the sample inputs:

Sample 1:

Input:
1 8 3
10

Processing wi=10:

start=10-8=2, end=9.

candles is empty. count=0. needed=3.

Add 9: inserted. candles becomes [9]. added=1.

current_pos=8. Check: not in candles. inserted. candles becomes [8,9]. added=2.

current_pos=7: inserted. candles becomes [7,8,9]. added=3. done.

Total candles is 3. Correct.

Sample 2:

Input:
2 10 1
5 8

Check t >=r (10 >=1 → yes).

Processing first wi=5:

start=5-10= -5, end=4.

candles is empty. needed=1.

Add 4. candles = [4].

Next ghost wi=8:

start=8-10= -2, end=7.

Check candles in [-2,7]. The candles list has 4. So count=1. needed=0. proceed.

Total candles is 1. Correct.

Sample 3:

Input:
1 1 3
10

r=3 > t=1 → output -1. Correct.

Another test case:

Input:
3 3 2

ghosts at 5, 7, 9.

t=3 >= r=2.

Processing 5:

start=5-3=2, end=4.

needed 2.

Add 4,3. Now candles [3,4].

Processing 7:

window is 7-3=4 to 6. Check candles in 4-6. Candles are 3,4. 4 is in the window. So count=1. Needed 1. Add 6. candles now [3,4,6].

Processing 9: window 6-8. Check candles: 6 is in window. count=1. needed 1. Add 8. candles [3,4,6,8].

Total is 4.

But let's see:

For ghost at 5: needs 2 candles in 2-4. 3 and4 → yes.

At 7: needs 2 in 4-6. 4 and6 → yes.

At 9: needs 2 in 6-8. 6 and8 → yes.

So the answer is 4.

So the code would correctly process this.

Another test case where overlapping is possible.

So the code seems to handle this.

Thus, the approach is correct.

```python
import bisect

m, t, r = map(int, input().split())
ghosts = list(map(int, input().split()))

if r > t:
    print(-1)
    exit()

candles = []

for wi in ghosts:
    start = wi - t
    end = wi - 1

    # Count existing candles in [start, end]
    left = bisect.bisect_left(candles, start)
    right_idx = bisect.bisect_right(candles, end)
    count = right_idx - left

    needed = r - count
    if needed <= 0:
        continue

    # Attempt to add 'needed' candles starting from the end of the window
    added = 0
    current_pos = end
    while added < needed and current_pos >= start:
        idx = bisect.bisect_left(candles, current_pos)
        if idx < len(candles) and candles[idx] == current_pos:
            current_pos -= 1
            continue
        # Insert the new candle and update the list
        bisect.insort(candles, current_pos)
        added += 1
        current_pos -= 1

    if added < needed:
        print(-1)
        exit()

print(len(candles))
