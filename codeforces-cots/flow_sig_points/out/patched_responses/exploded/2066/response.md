Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if a given binary string can have some digits removed such that the remaining number is divisible by 64. And the result must be a binary representation of that number. Hmm.

Wait, what's the key here? Well, 64 is 2^6. So in binary, any number divisible by 64 must end with at least six zeros. Because 64 in binary is 1000000. So any multiple of 64 will have a binary representation that ends with six zeros. For example, 64 is 1000000 (6 zeros), 128 is 10000000 (7 zeros, but the last six are zeros), etc.

So the problem reduces to: can we find a substring in the given binary string that starts with a 1 (since it's a positive integer, leading zeros are not allowed), followed by at least six zeros, and the total length of this substring is at least 7 digits (since 1 followed by six zeros is 7 digits). But wait, maybe more digits are allowed before the 1 and the zeros, but we can remove those. Wait, no. Because when we remove some digits, the remaining digits form the binary number. So the binary number must start with 1, followed by at least six zeros. But those digits must appear in order in the original string. So the idea is that the original string must contain a '1' followed by six '0's in order, and after that, maybe some other digits. But the other digits can be removed.

Wait, but the binary number is formed by removing some digits. So the resulting number's binary digits must be in the same order as the original string. So the problem is to check if there exists a subsequence in the input string that is '1' followed by six '0's, and possibly followed by any number of zeros (since trailing zeros after the six zeros would still make the number a multiple of 64). Wait, no. Because 64 in binary is 1000000, which is 7 digits. So any number that's a multiple of 64 will have a binary representation that starts with 1 followed by at least six zeros. Because 64 is 2^6, so any multiple of 64 is k * 2^6, where k is a positive integer. The binary representation of k*2^6 is the binary of k followed by six zeros. So for example, if k is 3 (binary 11), then 3*64 is 192, which is 11000000 in binary. So the binary representation must end with six zeros. But the binary number must start with 1, so the entire number is 1 followed by some digits and then six zeros. Wait, no. The leading part can have multiple 1s, but when you multiply by 64 (2^6), it's equivalent to shifting left by six bits, which appends six zeros. So the original number (k) can have any binary representation, but when multiplied by 64, the binary representation is k followed by six zeros. So the entire binary number must end with six zeros, but the part before can be anything (as long as it starts with 1, because k is at least 1).

So, the problem is to find a subsequence in the input string that starts with a 1, followed by at least six zeros. Because if such a subsequence exists, then the number formed is k * 64 (since the part before the six zeros is k, which is at least 1). So the key is to check if the input string has a 1, followed by six zeros in order.

Wait, but the six zeros can be part of a longer sequence of zeros. For example, seven zeros would work because we can take the first six of them. So the steps are:

1. Find the first occurrence of '1' such that after it, there are at least six '0's. The positions of these zeros must be after the '1'.

Alternatively, the approach could be to look for a '1' and then six '0's in the string in order, possibly with other characters in between. Because when you form a subsequence, you can skip those other characters.

So the algorithm would be:

Check if there exists a position where a '1' occurs, and after that, there are at least six '0's. The positions of the '0's must be after the '1'.

So how can we check this?

For each '1' in the string, check if there are six '0's after it.

If any such occurrence exists, then the answer is yes.

But also, note that the total length of the binary number must be at least 7 (since 1 followed by six zeros is 7 digits). So the input string must have at least seven characters. Wait, no. Because if the input is, for example, '1000000' (length 7), which is 64, then the answer is yes. But if the input is shorter than 7 characters, like 6, then it's impossible. So first, the input length must be at least 7. Otherwise, the answer is automatically no.

Wait, but the input can be longer than 7. For example, the first example input is 100010001, which has 9 characters. The solution is to take the '1' at position 0, then the zeros at positions 1, 2, 3, then maybe other zeros. But wait, in that case, after the '1' there are three zeros, then a '1', then three zeros, then another '1'. So after the first '1', there's 3 zeros, then other digits. So the problem is that the six zeros after the '1' must be in order. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Check if the input length is less than 7: if yes, output 'no' (since even the minimal 7-digit number is 1000000).

2. Otherwise, for each '1' in the string, check if there are at least six '0's after it (not necessarily consecutive, but in order). If any '1' satisfies this condition, output 'yes'.

But wait, for example, if the string is '100000', length 6, then output is 'no'. If it's '1000000' (length 7), output 'yes'.

So the algorithm steps:

- If the length of the string is less than 7: return 'no'.

Else:

- Check if there exists a '1' in the string, such that after that '1', there are at least six '0's (possibly with other digits in between, but in order). The six zeros can be found by scanning the string after the '1's position and counting how many zeros are left, but they need to be in sequence.

Wait, no. Because the zeros need not be consecutive, but they have to appear in order. For example, if after the '1' there are 5 zeros, but then a 1, then two zeros. Then there are six zeros in total after the '1' but not all consecutive. But can we pick the first six zeros?

Wait, no. Because the order matters. So suppose the string is '1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0'. Then the '1' at position 0: after it, there are five zeros (positions 1-5), then a 1, then a 0. So to get six zeros, we need to pick the first five zeros and then the next zero at position 7. So yes, that's possible. So the zeros can be spread out, as long as there are six of them after the '1's position.

So the approach is: for each '1' in the string, check if the number of zeros in the entire string after the '1' is at least six. But that's not sufficient. Because the zeros need to be in order. For example, if after the '1' there are some zeros, then a '1', then more zeros. But to collect six zeros, the zeros can be in any order as long as they are after the '1' and we can select them in sequence.

Wait, but the subsequence must consist of the '1' followed by six '0's in the original order. So, for example, if the '1' is at position i, then there must be six positions j1, j2, j3, j4, j5, j6, all greater than i, such that s[j1] = '0', s[j2] = '0', etc. And j1 < j2 < j3 < j4 < j5 < j6.

So the way to check this is:

For each occurrence of '1' in the string (let's say at index i):

- Then, starting from i+1, find the next six '0's in order.

If such a sequence exists, then return 'yes'.

So, how to implement this?

For each i where s[i] is '1', check if in the substring s[i+1..] there are at least six '0's. But not just the count. The actual positions must allow six '0's in order.

For example, s could have 10 '0's after i, but if they are not in order, but interleaved with '1's. Wait, no: the original string is given, and the zeros after i can be in any order, but as long as there are six zeros in the string after i, and they can be selected in order. Because the subsequence allows us to pick the first '0' after i, then the next '0' after that, etc., up to six times.

So, the total number of zeros after the '1' is sufficient. Wait, no. Wait, for example: the string after the '1' has 5 zeros. Then even if they are in order, you can't pick six. So the total count of zeros after the '1' must be >=6.

Ah, right! Because if after the '1' (position i), the substring s[i+1 ... len(s)-1] has at least six '0's, then there must be a way to select six of them in order. Because even if there are other characters, you can skip them.

So the algorithm can be:

If the length of the string is less than 7: output 'no'.

Else:

For each index i in 0 to len(s)-7 (since after i, we need 6 more digits, so the earliest i can be len(s)-7):

Wait, no. Because the '1' can be anywhere, but after it, there must be six '0's. So the '1' can be at position i, and the six '0's can be in positions j1 > i, j2 > j1, etc., up to j6. So the earliest possible is when the '1' is at position 0, and the next six characters are '0's (i.e., the string is '1000000...'). But the '1' could be in the middle.

So, the algorithm steps:

Check if the string length is at least 7. If not, return 'no'.

For each i from 0 to len(s)-1 where s[i] == '1':

   count = 0

   for j from i+1 to len(s)-1:

      if s[j] == '0':

          count +=1

          if count ==6:

              return 'yes'

So, for each '1' in the string, check if there are six '0's after it. If any such '1' exists, then output 'yes'.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, perhaps there's a '1' that's followed by more than six zeros, but the zeros are not all consecutive. For example, '1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'—the first '1' is followed by seven zeros. So when we check after the first '1', we count six zeros, so it's okay.

Another example: '1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0' — here, after the first '1', there's a zero, then a '1', then five zeros. So when we check after the first '1', we have one zero, then other characters. So the count is 1, then when j increments, we find another '0's. So in this case, after the first '1', there are 1 (from index 1) + 5 (from indices 4-8) zeros. So total 6 zeros. So the code would count them and return yes.

So the code would correctly find that the '1' at position 0 is followed by six zeros (even though some are after a '1').

So the code can be structured as follows:

Read the input string s.

If len(s) <7: print 'no' and exit.

Else, iterate over each character in s:

   if current character is '1', then check the remaining part of the string (from next index onwards) to see if there are at least six '0's.

But how to check that?

For each '1' at index i:

   count the number of '0's in s[i+1:]. If the total is >=6, then return yes.

Wait, no. Because even if there are six '0's, but they are not in order, but the code is counting the total zeros. Wait no. Because the code counts the zeros in s[i+1:] regardless of their order. But in this case, the code is counting the total zeros after i. Since the problem allows us to remove other characters, the zeros can be selected in order. So if after the '1' there are at least six '0's in the entire remaining string, then yes. Because even if there are other characters in between, we can skip them. So for example, after the '1', the remaining part is '0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'. The total zeros after the '1' is 7. So even though some zeros are after a '1', we can pick the first zero, then the five zeros after the '1', making six. So in this case, the code would find that there are 7 zeros, which is >=6, and return yes.

Wait, but the code in the approach I thought of earlier would count the zeros in order. So for example, for each '1' at i, we look for the first zero after i (any zero), then the next zero after that, etc. So to check if six zeros can be found in order after the '1'.

Wait, perhaps the code should check if there are six zeros in the remaining part of the string, but not necessarily consecutive. For example, in the code:

for each '1' at i:

   zeros_needed = 6

   current = i+1

   while zeros_needed >0 and current < len(s):

       if s[current] == '0':

           zeros_needed -=1

       current +=1

   if zeros_needed ==0:

       return yes

So this code would find, for each '1', whether there are six zeros after it, possibly with other characters in between. Because it scans the string from i+1 onwards, and whenever a zero is found, it counts it towards the zeros_needed. So the code stops when either all six zeros are found or the end of the string is reached.

Yes. This approach is correct.

For example, in the string '101000000', the first '1' is at index 0. Then the code checks:

current =1, s[1] is '0', zeros_needed becomes 5. current increments to 2.

s[2] is '1' → ignored. current becomes 3.

s[3] is '0' → zeros_needed 4. current 4.

s[4] '0' → 3. current5.

s5:0 → 2. current6.

s6:0 →1. current7.

s7:0 →0. So zeros_needed is 0. So return yes.

So this approach works.

So the steps for the code are:

Check if the length is >=7. If not, output 'no'.

Else, for each index i where s[i] is '1':

   check if there are six '0's in the string after i (in any positions, but in order). If yes, output 'yes'.

If none of the '1's satisfy this, output 'no'.

So the code would look like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    if len(s) <7:

        print('no', file=output_stream)

    else:

        for i in range(len(s)):

            if s[i] == '1':

                # check if there are 6 zeros after this position

                zeros_needed =6

                j = i+1

                while j < len(s) and zeros_needed >0:

                    if s[j] == '0':

                        zeros_needed -=1

                    j +=1

                if zeros_needed ==0:

                    print('yes', file=output_stream)

                    return

        print('no', file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

""",
            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example input: '100' → len 3 <7 → output 'no'.

Another test case: '1000000' → len 7. The first '1' is at 0. Then 6 zeros → zeros_needed becomes 0. So 'yes'.

Another test case: '100000' → len 6 → output 'no'.

Another case: '01000000' → len 8. The first '1' is at index 1. Then after that, there are 6 zeros. So zeros_needed is 6. So code returns 'yes'.

Another case: '1110000' → len 7. The first '1's are at 0,1,2. For i=0: after that, the string is '110000'. So how many zeros can we find? Let's see:

j starts at 1. s[1] is '1' → ignored. j increments.

s[2] is '1' → ignored. j=3: '0' → zeros_needed=5. j=4: '0' →4. j=5: '0' →3. j=6: '0' →2. j reaches end. zeros_needed is 2. So not enough.

Then check i=1. After that, the string starts at index 2. s[2] is '1' → check after. j=2: '1' → no. Then j=3:0, zeros_needed=5. j=4:0 →4. j=5:0 →3. j=6:0 →2. Again, zeros_needed=2.

i=2: j starts at 3. s[3] is 0 → 5. Then j=4:0→4, j=5:0→3, j=6:0→2. Again, not enough.

So code would output 'no'. Because even though there are 4 zeros after the first '1', but they are not six.

So in this case, the code correctly outputs 'no'.

So the code seems correct.

Now, considering the constraints. The input string can be up to 100 characters. For each '1' in the string (up to 100), we loop through up to 100 characters. So in the worst case, 100 * 100 = 10,000 operations. Which is well within the time constraints (1 second can handle up to around 1e8 operations).

So the code is efficient enough.

Therefore, the code is correct and efficient.

s = input().strip()
n = len(s)

            zeros_needed = 6
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and zeros_needed > 0:
                if s[j] == '0':
                    zeros_needed -= 1
