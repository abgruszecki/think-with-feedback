<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. We need to compute the expected length of the multiverse when the Doctor ends up at one of the ends (leftmost or rightmost), which stops the TARDIS. The input gives us the initial length (n), the Doctor's initial position (k), and the maximum possible length (m). The process happens in steps where each step either creates a new universe or breaks a link, with probabilities depending on the current length l.

Hmm, so first, let's model the process. The key is that once the Doctor is at either end, the process stops, and we need the expected value of l at that moment.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. The state would be the current length of the multiverse and the Doctor's position. Because the Doctor's position is between 1 and l (assuming positions are 1-based). Wait, the initial position is given as k, which is between 1 and n. So in each state, we have l (current length) and pos (Doctor's position). The transitions depend on whether we create or break.

But since m can be up to 250, and pos can be up to l, which can be up to m, the total number of possible states is O(m^2), which is manageable for m=250. So maybe we can model this with DP, where E[l][pos] represents the expected value of the length when the process stops, starting from current length l and position pos.

Wait, but when the process stops, the current l is the value we need. So for each state (l, pos), if pos is 1 or l (i.e., already at the ends), then the expected value is l, since the process stops immediately. Otherwise, we need to compute the expected value based on the transitions.

So the base case is when pos is 1 or l: E[l][pos] = l.

For other states, we need to consider the two possible events (create or break) with their respective probabilities. But the probabilities depend on the current l.

Let's break down the transitions.

First, when the current length is l:

Probability of creating: p_create = 1 - l/m.

When creating a universe, the new universe is inserted in one of l+1 possible positions. Each position is equally likely. Inserting a new universe increases the length to l+1, and the Doctor's position may shift if the insertion is to the left of him. For example, if the Doctor was at position i, and a new universe is inserted at position j (where 1 <= j <= l+1), then in the new state, the Doctor's position is i if j > i, or i+1 if j <= i. Wait, no: inserting at position j (between universe j-1 and j, 0-based perhaps). Wait, the problem says when a universe is created, it can be between any two adjacent or at the ends. So for l universes, there are l+1 possible positions for insertion. For example, inserting at position 0 would be before the first universe, position 1 is between first and second, etc. So when inserting at position j (0-based), the new length becomes l+1, and the Doctor's position depends on whether j is less than his current position (1-based). 

Wait, original positions are 1-based. So inserting a new universe at position j (0-based in the possible positions) would shift the Doctor's position. For example, if the current Doctor's position is i (1-based), then inserting a new universe at any position before or at i-1 would increase the Doctor's position by 1. Because, for example, inserting between positions i-1 and i (assuming 1-based) would split that into two parts, making the Doctor's original i-th position now the (i+1)-th.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the insertion positions as 0-based in the possible l+1 positions. For example, inserting at position 0 would be at the very left end. Then, for each insertion at position j (0-based in 0..l), the new length is l+1. The Doctor's original position (pos) in 1..l would become pos+1 if j < pos. Because inserting before pos's original position shifts it to the right. Wait, no. Let me think.

Original positions are 1..l. Inserting a new universe at position j (0-based in 0 to l). So inserting before the first universe (j=0), after the last (j=l). For each insertion at j, the new positions of existing elements are shifted. So if the original pos is i (1-based), then after inserting at j (0-based between 0 and l), the new position of the Doctor is:

If j < i-1: then inserting before the (i-1)th element (original 1-based) would shift the Doctor's position to i+1? Wait, no. Let's think of the original sequence as positions 1..l. Inserting a new universe at position j (0-based) in the possible l+1 positions. For example, inserting at j=0 would add a new universe at the beginning, so all original positions are shifted right by 1. So the original pos i becomes i+1. Inserting at j=1 (between pos 1 and 2) would cause the original pos i >=2 to become i+1. So for insertion at j, the new pos is i + 1 if j <= i-1. Because inserting at j (0-based) is equivalent to inserting after the j-th original element. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.

Original positions are 1-based. Inserting at position j (0-based) in the possible l+1 insertion points. For example, inserting after the original position j (0-based). Wait, maybe the insertion points are between existing elements, including the ends. So inserting at position 0 adds a new universe before all others. Inserting at position l adds a new universe after all others. So inserting at position j (0-based) between original positions j and j+1 (1-based), or before the first, etc.

So when a new universe is inserted at j (0-based), the original positions are adjusted. For the original position i (1-based), the new position in the new length l+1 is:

If the insertion is at j < i-1: then the original i-th position is now i+1. Because inserting a new element before it. For example, original positions 1,2,3. Insert at j=0 (before 1): new positions are 1 (new), 2 (old 1), 3 (old 2), 4 (old 3). So Doctor's pos 3 becomes 4. If inserted at j=1 (between 1 and 2), original 2 becomes 3. So for insertion j < i-1 (since i is original 1-based, inserting at j can be 0 to i-2 (0-based), which is j < i-1). Then the new pos is i+1. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that inserting at position j (0-based) in the insertion points, the new position of the Doctor is i + 1 if j < i, because inserting before the i-th original position (which is j = i-1 in 0-based). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's take some examples.

Suppose original l=2, pos=1. Inserting at j=0 (before pos 1): new pos is 2. Inserting at j=1 (between pos 1 and 2): new pos is 1 (since insertion is after pos1, so pos1 remains in original place, and pos2 becomes 3). Wait, no. The original positions are 1 and 2. Inserting at j=0 (before 1): new positions are [new, 1, 2]. So original pos1 becomes 2. Doctor's new pos is 2. Inserting at j=1 (between 1 and 2): new positions are [1, new, 2]. Doctor's pos remains 1. Inserting at j=2 (after 2): new positions are [1,2, new]. Doctor's pos remains 1. So when inserting at j (0-based) in 0..l (original l=2, insertion points 0,1,2), the new pos is:

- For original pos i=1:

If j < i → j < 1 (since i is 1, j can be 0): inserting at j=0, new pos is 2.

If j >= i (j >=1): inserting after i's original position, so new pos remains 1.

So for original pos i, inserting at j (0-based) insertion points. The new pos is i + 1 if j < i, else i remains the same. Because inserting at j < i means inserting before the current i-th position, which shifts the Doctor's position to the right by one.

So the new pos after insertion is:

if insertion_j < current_pos → new_pos = current_pos + 1

else → new_pos remains the same.

But insertion_j is 0-based in 0..l (since inserting into l+1 possible positions for a length l).

So when creating a new universe, the insertion_j can be from 0 to l. For each possible insertion_j, the probability is 1/(l+1). So the expected value for the create case is the average over all possible insertion_j of the E[l+1][new_pos], where new_pos is current_pos + 1 if insertion_j < current_pos, else current_pos.

The break case is more complicated. When breaking, we choose a link between two adjacent universes. There are l-1 links (since l is the current length). The Doctor's segment (the one containing him) is kept; the other is discarded. So after breaking, the new length is the size of the kept segment.

For example, if the current length is l=5 and the Doctor is at position 3. When breaking between 2 and 3 (link 2), then the left segment is 2 universes, and the right segment is 3 (including the Doctor). So the new length is 3, and the Doctor's position is 1 in the new segment. Because the right segment is kept. Wait, no. Wait, when you break a link, the multiverse is split into two parts. The part that does not contain the Doctor is discarded. So the Doctor's position is now in the kept part. The position depends on which part is kept.

Wait, suppose we break at link i (between universe i and i+1, 1-based links). The left part is 1..i, the right part is i+1..l. So if the Doctor is in the left part (pos <= i), the left part is kept. Then the new length is i, and the Doctor's position remains the same. If the Doctor is in the right part (pos > i), the right part is kept. The new length is l - i, and the Doctor's position is pos - i.

So for each possible link (i) in 1..l-1 (since links are between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.), the probability is 1/(l-1). For each, we split into two possibilities. Then, after breaking, the new l and pos are determined.

But in the breaking case, the new state depends on which link is broken and which segment is kept. So for each possible link i (1-based), there's a 1/(l-1) chance. For each such i, check if the Doctor is in the left or right part. Then compute the new l and pos.

So the DP transitions are:

For a state (l, pos), if pos is 1 or l, then E[l][pos] = l.

Else:

E[l][pos] = p_create * (sum over possible insertions) + p_break * (sum over possible breaks) 

But since the transitions can have a lot of possibilities, we need to compute these sums efficiently.

So the plan is:

- Precompute for all possible (l, pos) states the expected value, using memoization or dynamic programming.

The main variables are l (current length) and pos (current position). The maximum possible l is m, and pos can be up to l, so the DP table is of size m * (m) = 250 * 250 = 62500, which is manageable.

The transitions involve:

For create case (probability (1 - l/m)):

There are l+1 possible insertion positions. For each, calculate the new_pos and then add E[l+1][new_pos] multiplied by 1/(l+1) probability for that insertion.

For break case (probability l/m):

There are l-1 possible links. For each, calculate the new_l and new_pos, then add E[new_l][new_pos] multiplied by 1/(l-1) probability for that link.

But wait, when you break a link, the new_l is determined by which part contains the Doctor. For example, when breaking at link i (1-based), if the Doctor is in the left part (pos <= i), then new_l is i, new_pos is pos. If in the right part (pos > i), then new_l is l - i, new_pos is pos - i.

So for each possible link i in 1..l-1:

If pos <= i: the new state is (i, pos).

Else: new state is (l - i, pos - i).

But we need to consider that in the breaking step, after splitting, the Doctor is in one of the segments. Then, that segment becomes the new multiverse, and the other is discarded.

So for each possible i (link), the new_l and new_pos are computed as follows.

But after breaking, the new state may have the Doctor at an end (pos_new is 1 or new_l), which would stop the process. For example, if breaking at i=pos-1, then in the new state, the Doctor is at pos, which is i+1 = pos, but if i=pos-1, then the left part is 1..i = pos-1, and the right part is pos..l. So if pos is in the right part (pos > i), then new_l is l - i (which is l - (pos-1)), new_pos is pos - (pos-1) = 1. So the Doctor is now at position 1 of the new_l, which is l - (pos-1). Wait, let's see:

Original pos is in the right part. So new_l = l - i. The new_pos is pos - i.

If i = pos-1, then new_pos is pos - (pos-1) = 1, which is the left end. So in this case, the process stops, and the expected value is new_l.

Therefore, when breaking, some transitions lead to a terminal state.

So for the DP, when computing the break transitions, for each possible link i, we compute the new state (new_l, new_pos). If new_pos is 1 or new_l, then we add new_l multiplied by the probability of this transition. Otherwise, we add E[new_l][new_pos] multiplied by the probability.

So the DP recurrence is:

E[l][pos] = (if create happens) * (create_contribution) + (if break happens) * (break_contribution)

Where create_contribution is the sum over all possible insertions, each leading to E[l+1][new_pos] * (1/(l+1)), multiplied by p_create.

Break_contribution is the sum over all possible links i, each leading to either new_l (if new_pos is end) or E[new_l][new_pos], multiplied by (1/(l-1)), multiplied by p_break.

So the challenge is to compute these transitions efficiently.

Now, considering that m can be up to 250, and each state depends on other states (possibly larger l for create case), but since the maximum l is m, once l reaches m, the create case can't happen (since p_create is 1 - l/m, which would be zero). So for l == m, the create case is not possible. Only break can happen.

But wait, when l < m, create can happen. But once l is m, create can't happen. So in that case, the transitions for l = m can only involve breaking links.

So the DP must process states in such a way that for a given (l, pos), all possible transitions are considered. However, for the create case, l can increase up to m. For example, when l is m-1, create can happen (if p_create is 1 - (m-1)/m = 1/m), leading to l = m, but then in that state, create can't happen anymore.

So the steps for solving this problem:

1. Precompute all possible (l, pos) states, where 1 <= l <= m, and 1 <= pos <= l.

2. For each state, compute E[l][pos] based on transitions.

But since some states may depend on higher l (like create transitions), we need to process the states in reverse order, starting from the largest l and working down. Or perhaps use memoization and compute them on demand, but that might be slow for Python.

Alternatively, since for l = m, create is not possible, and break can only split into smaller l. So perhaps process states in order of decreasing l.

Wait, for l = m, create is not possible, so the create contribution is zero. The break contribution is handled by breaking into smaller l's. So the order of processing should be from l = m down to l = 1.

But for l = m, when processing E[m][pos], we need to look at breaking transitions, which can lead to l' = i or l' = m - i, where i is the link being broken.

So processing in decreasing order of l might work, but perhaps it's easier to model this with memoization and recursion with caching. However, recursion depth could be a problem, but since l is up to 250, recursion is manageable.

But in Python, recursion may hit stack limits. So better to use dynamic programming with iterative approach.

So, the plan is:

- For all l from m down to 1:

   For each possible pos in 1..l:

      If pos is 1 or l: E[l][pos] = l.

      Else:

          Compute the create contribution:

              if l == m: p_create is 0.

              else:

                  p_create = (1 - l/m) / mod inverse?

                  wait, but all probabilities are fractions, and we need to compute them modulo 1e9+7. Oh, right, the problem requires us to compute the answer as a fraction p/q, and output r such that p ≡ r * q mod MOD. So we need to represent E[l][pos] as a rational number, but using modular inverses.

Hmm, but how to model this? Because the DP transitions involve fractions, which need to be handled modulo MOD = 1e9+7.

Yes, we need to model all operations using modular inverses.

So the approach is to represent the expected value as a number modulo MOD, and perform all calculations with modular inverses.

So for each state (l, pos), the expected value is stored as a fraction modulo MOD. For transitions, all probabilities are represented as their modular inverse equivalents.

Therefore, all divisions are replaced by multiplying by the modular inverse.

So, for example, the create probability is (1 - l/m) which can be rewritten as (m - l)/m. Then, the probability is (m - l)/m multiplied by each of the insertion probabilities (1/(l+1)), etc.

So the create contribution would be:

p_create * sum_{j=0 to l} (E_new_j) / (l+1)

But p_create is (m-l)/m, and the sum over j is (sum E_new_j) * inv(l+1), where inv is the modular inverse.

Similarly for the break contribution.

So to model this, for each state (l, pos) not in a terminal state:

E[l][pos] = ( ( ( (m - l) * inv(m) ) % MOD ) * create_term ) % MOD + ( ( (l * inv(m) ) % MOD ) * break_term ) % MOD ) % MOD

where create_term is the average of E[l+1][new_pos] over all possible insertions, and break_term is the average of either new_l (if new_pos is end) or E[new_l][new_pos] over all possible links.

Now, how to compute create_term and break_term.

Let's handle create_term first. For create, inserting into each possible j (0-based 0 to l), which is l+1 possibilities. For each j, the new_pos is pos_after_insertion. So:

create_term = sum( E[l+1][new_pos] ) * inv(l+1)

But for l+1, we need to make sure that l+1 <= m. Because when l is m, create is not possible. So in the code, when l < m, create is possible. So for l < m:

create_possible = True.

For each j in 0 to l (inclusive), compute new_pos as:

if j < pos: new_pos is pos + 1 (since inserting before pos's original position shifts it right)

else: new_pos is pos.

But wait, in the original state (l, pos), when inserting at j (0-based in 0..l), the new length is l+1. For example, inserting at j=0 (before pos 1) would shift all positions to the right by 1. So if original pos is 1, inserting at j=0 would make new_pos 2. Inserting at j=1 (after pos 1) would make new_pos 1.

So the new_pos after insertion is:

if j < pos: new_pos = pos + 1

else: new_pos remains pos.

Wait, no. Wait, j ranges from 0 to l (inclusive), which is the insertion positions. For example, inserting at j=0 (before the first universe) shifts all positions to the right by 1. So original pos becomes pos+1. Inserting at j=1 (between first and second universe) shifts all positions after j to the right. So if original pos is 2, inserting at j=1 would shift pos 2 to 3. Inserting at j=2 (after pos 2) doesn't shift it.

So for each insertion j (0-based), the new_pos is:

if j < original_pos: new_pos = original_pos + 1

else: new_pos = original_pos.

Yes, that's correct. Because inserting at a position before the original pos (0-based insertion j is less than original_pos (which is 1-based) minus 1?), wait, perhaps not.

Wait, original pos is 1-based. Insertion j is 0-based. For example, original l is 3, pos is 2. Inserting at j=1 (between first and second universe). Original positions are 1,2,3. Inserting at j=1 would create new positions as 1, new, 2,3. So original pos 2 is now at position 3. So new_pos is 3. So j is 1, which is less than original pos (2). So the condition is j < pos (since j is 0-based, pos is 1-based). So the new_pos is pos + 1 if j < pos. Because inserting before the current position's original position.

Yes, because inserting at j (0-based) between existing elements. For example, original pos is 3 (1-based). Inserting at j=2 (0-based, between pos 3 and 4, but original l is 3, so j can be up to 3). Wait, no. For original l=3, insertion positions are 0,1,2,3. So inserting at j=3 adds after the last element. So inserting at j=2 (0-based) would be between pos 2 and 3. Then, the new length is 4. The original pos 3 is now at position 4. Inserting at j=3 (after pos 3) would add a new universe, and original pos 3 remains at position 3.

So yes, inserting at j (0-based) positions less than original pos (1-based) will shift the Doctor's position by +1. Otherwise, it remains the same.

Thus, for create case, new_pos is:

new_pos = pos + 1 if j < pos else pos.

So for each j in 0..l:

if j < pos: new_pos = pos + 1

else: new_pos = pos.

But since j can be 0 to l (inclusive), which is the number of insertion positions (l+1).

So for create_term, we need to calculate the sum over all j in 0..l of E[l+1][new_pos_j], where new_pos_j is either pos + 1 (if j < pos) or pos (if j >= pos).

But how many j's are less than pos? Let's see. For j in 0..l. Each j is an integer between 0 and l.

The number of j's less than pos is pos (since j starts at 0). Because for j < pos: j can be 0,1,..., pos-1 → total of pos elements.

The rest (l+1 - pos) j's are >= pos.

So the sum for create_term is:

sum_{j=0}^{l} E[l+1][new_pos_j] = pos * E[l+1][pos+1] + (l+1 - pos) * E[l+1][pos]

Because for pos j's, new_pos is pos+1, and the remaining (l+1 - pos) j's have new_pos as pos.

So create_term can be computed as:

create_sum = pos * E_plus_1_pos_plus_1 + ( (l + 1 - pos) ) * E_plus_1_pos

where E_plus_1_pos_plus_1 is E[l+1][pos + 1], and E_plus_1_pos is E[l+1][pos].

Then, create_term = create_sum * inv(l+1) mod MOD.

This simplifies the create case calculation from O(l) per state to O(1) per state, which is crucial for efficiency.

Now for the break case. For each link i (1-based from 1 to l-1), when breaking at i:

if pos <= i → new_l = i, new_pos = pos. Check if new_pos is 1 or new_l (i) → if pos is 1 or i (since new_l is i).

Else → new_l = l - i, new_pos = pos - i. Check if new_pos is 1 or new_l (l - i).

So for each link i:

if pos <= i:

   new_l = i

   new_pos = pos

   if new_pos == 1 or new_pos == new_l → contribute new_l * (1/(l-1)) * p_break.

   else → contribute E[new_l][new_pos] * (1/(l-1)) * p_break.

else:

   new_l = l - i

   new_pos = pos - i

   if new_pos == 1 or new_pos == new_l → contribute new_l * (1/(l-1)) * p_break.

   else → contribute E[new_l][new_pos] * (1/(l-1)) * p_break.

But summing over all i from 1 to l-1.

Again, this could be O(l) per state, but for l up to 250, and m=250, the total per state is O(l) → 250 * 250 * 250 = 15,625,000 operations. For Python, this may be acceptable given the time constraints (4 seconds per test case), but perhaps we can find a way to optimize this.

Alternatively, we can precompute for each state (l, pos) the break_sum.

But how?

Let's think of the break_sum as sum over i=1 to l-1 of:

   if pos <= i:

      term = E[i][pos] if pos is not 1 or i, else i

   else:

      term = E[l - i][pos - i] if (pos - i) is not 1 or (l - i), else (l - i)

But for each i, this is O(1) once E[i][...] is known.

But for each state (l, pos), this is O(l) steps.

But l can be up to 250, and there are 250 * 250 = 62500 states. So 62500 * 250 = 15,625,000 operations. Which should be manageable.

But in Python, loops can be slow, so perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, precompute for each (l, pos) the number of links that split into a certain new_l and new_pos, but I'm not sure.

Another approach is to note that for break case, the sum can be split into two parts:

sum_{i=1 to pos-1} [ if pos <= i → but i >= pos? No. So for i < pos, the condition pos <= i is false. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, the link i is between universe i and i+1. So for pos <= i → the Doctor is in the left segment. So for each i in 1..l-1:

if pos <= i → left part is kept. new_l = i, new_pos = pos.

Else → right part is kept. new_l = l - i, new_pos = pos - i.

So for each i, we have two possibilities.

So the sum can be split into i from 1 to pos-1 (right part), and i from pos to l-1 (left part? No. Wait, when i >= pos? Wait, pos is 1-based. For example, if pos is 3, and i is 2, then pos > i. So for i < pos → pos > i → right part.

Wait, the Doctor's pos is in 1..l. The link i is between i and i+1. So the left part is 1..i, the right part is i+1..l.

So for pos to be in the left part, pos must be <= i. For pos to be in the right part, pos must be > i.

So for each i from 1 to l-1:

if pos <= i → new_l = i, new_pos = pos.

else → new_l = l - i, new_pos = pos - i.

Thus, for the sum over i=1 to l-1:

sum += (if pos <= i: [term for left] else: [term for right}) * (1/(l-1)).

But how to split this into ranges of i where pos <= i and i >= pos.

The split occurs at i = pos-1. Because when i >= pos → pos <= i only if i >= pos. Wait, no. For example, pos is 3:

i can be 3 → pos (3) <= i (3) → yes. So for i >= pos (3), it's possible.

Wait, but i runs up to l-1. For pos in 2..l-1:

The i ranges where pos <= i is i >= pos, up to l-1.

So for i >= pos and <= l-1, the left part is kept.

But for i >= pos and i <= l-1, the new_l is i, which could be up to l-1.

Wait, but in the break case, the new_l is i (for left part) or l - i (for right part).

So for the sum:

sum_break = sum_{i=1 to pos-1} term_right + sum_{i=pos to l-1} term_left.

Where term_right is the term when the right part is kept (i < pos), and term_left is when the left part is kept (i >= pos).

Now, for each i in 1 to pos-1:

term_right is:

new_l = l - i

new_pos = pos - i.

Check if new_pos is 1 or new_l. If so, term is new_l. Else, term is E[new_l][new_pos].

For i from pos to l-1:

term_left is:

new_l = i

new_pos = pos.

Check if pos is 1 or i. If so, term is i. Else, term is E[i][pos].

So for each i in 1 to pos-1:

compute term_right.

For each i in pos to l-1:

compute term_left.

Sum all terms and multiply by (1/(l-1)).

This is O(l) per state.

So for each state (l, pos), the break_sum is computed as:

break_sum = 0

for i in 1 to pos-1:

   new_l = l - i

   new_pos = pos - i

   if new_pos == 1 or new_pos == new_l:

      term = new_l

   else:

      term = E[new_l][new_pos]

   break_sum += term

for i in pos to l-1:

   new_l = i

   new_pos = pos

   if new_pos == 1 or new_l == new_pos:

      term = new_l

   else:

      term = E[new_l][new_pos]

   break_sum += term

break_sum = break_sum * inv(l-1) mod MOD.

But when l-1 is zero (i.e., l=1), but since l starts at 1, and in the code, for l=1, pos can only be 1 (since pos ranges from 1 to l). So for l=1, the pos is 1, which is a terminal state, so the code skips processing break case.

So for l >= 2, l-1 >=1.

But for the code, when l=1, the break case is not possible since l-1=0, but pos=1 is a terminal.

So in code, when l >=2, we can proceed.

But in Python, loops can be slow for 250 * 250 * 250 steps, but for 15 million steps, perhaps it's manageable.

But how to handle the modular inverses?

We need to precompute all possible inverses up to 500 (since l can be up to 250, so l-1 can be up to 249, and l+1 can be up to 250+1=251. So inverses up to 500 should suffice.

Alternatively, compute the inverses on the fly using pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).

But for efficiency, precompute inverses for 1..500.

So precompute inv = [0] * (max_n + 1), where max_n is 500.

Then, for x in 1..500, inv[x] = pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).

This can be done once at the start.

Now, putting this all together.

The steps for the code:

1. Read n, k, m.

2. Check if k is 1 or n. If so, output l =n. Because the process stops immediately.

Wait, the initial state is (n, k). If k is 1 or n, then the expected value is n. So for example, in the first sample input, 2 1 2: the Doctor is already at position 1. So output 2.

But according to the sample input, that's correct.

So first, check if the initial pos is 1 or n. If yes, output n. Else, proceed.

But wait, the problem says that the Doctor starts in position k, which is between 1 and n. So if k is 1 or n, the process stops immediately, and the answer is n.

So the code should first check if the initial pos is 1 or n. If yes, output n. Else, compute the DP.

So in code:

if initial_pos is 1 or initial_l is n (initial_l is n), then the answer is n.

Else, proceed with DP.

So the code must handle that.

Otherwise, the code proceeds to compute the DP table.

So in code:

n, k, m = map(int, input().split())

MOD = 10**9 +7

if k ==1 or k ==n:

   print(n % MOD)

   exit()

Now, proceed to compute the DP.

But wait, the initial state is (n, k). So initial_l is n, initial_pos is k.

But if during the process, l increases beyond m? No, because when l reaches m, create can't happen anymore. Because p_create = 1 - l/m → when l=m, this is zero.

So the code needs to precompute all possible (l, pos) from l=1 up to m.

So the plan is:

- Initialize a 2D array E where E[l][pos] is the expected value modulo MOD.

But in Python, we can represent this as a dictionary or a list of lists. Given that m is up to 250, a list of lists is feasible.

Initialize a list of lists, say E, where E[l] is a list of size l+1 (positions 0..l, but ignoring 0, since positions are 1-based). Wait, perhaps we can have E as a list where E[l] is a list of size l+1, but only indices 1..l are used.

But for easier handling, let's create a list of lists where for each l in 1..m, E[l] is a list of size l+1 (indices 0 to l), but positions 1..l are valid.

So in code, E = [ [0]*(m+2) for _ in range(m+2) ] ?

Alternatively, since m can be up to 250, we can create a 2D array E of size (m+2) x (m+2), where E[l][pos] is the expected value for state (l, pos).

Now, precompute the inverses for all numbers up to 500.

inv = [1]*(501)

for i in range(2, 501):

   inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD)

Then, process the states in reverse order of l (from m down to 1).

But for create case, when we compute E[l][pos], we need E[l+1][...], which may have been computed already if we process l in reverse order. Because for l = m, l+1 is m+1, which is beyond the maximum possible l (m). So for l = m, the create case is impossible. So we process l from m down to 1.

Wait, no. When we process l in decreasing order, for l = m, create case is impossible. For l = m-1, create case can happen, leading to l+1 = m. But since l+1 = m is processed first (since we process l in reverse order), when we process l = m-1, E[m][...] is already computed. So this order is correct.

Yes.

So processing l from m down to 1:

for l in range(m, 0, -1):

   for pos in range(1, l+1):

      if pos ==1 or pos == l:

          E[l][pos] = l % MOD

      else:

          # compute create contribution and break contribution

          # handle create case

          create_contrib = 0

          if l < m:

              # compute create_sum

              num_less = pos  # j can be 0..pos-1 → pos terms.

              num_more = (l +1 ) - pos

              # new_l is l+1.

              # for j < pos → new_pos is pos +1

              # for j >= pos → new_pos is pos.

              # sum is num_less * E[l+1][pos+1] + num_more * E[l+1][pos]

              # multiply by inv(l+1) and then by (m - l)/m

              # need to handle when l+1 is m.

              term1 = E[l+1][pos+1] if (pos+1 <= l+1) else 0

              # because for l+1, the max pos is l+1.

              # but when l+1 is processed, pos+1 can be up to l+1.

              # since in l+1, pos ranges from 1 to l+1.

              # So for example, if l+1 is m, and pos is l, then pos+1 would be l+1, which is allowed.

              term1 = (num_less * E[l+1][pos+1]) % MOD

              term2 = (num_more * E[l+1][pos]) % MOD

              create_sum = (term1 + term2) % MOD

              create_coeff = ((m - l) * inv[m]) % MOD

              inv_l_plus_1 = inv[l+1]

              create_contrib = (create_sum * inv_l_plus_1 % MOD) * create_coeff % MOD

          else:

              create_contrib = 0

          # handle break case

          break_contrib = 0

          if l > 1:

              # need to sum over all links i from 1 to l-1.

              # split into i < pos and i >= pos.

              sum_terms = 0

              for i in range(1, l):

                  if i < pos:

                      # right part is kept.

                      new_l = l - i

                      new_pos = pos - i

                      if new_pos ==1 or new_pos == new_l:

                          term = new_l

                      else:

                          term = E[new_l][new_pos]

                  else:

                      # left part is kept.

                      new_l = i

                      new_pos = pos

                      if new_pos ==1 or new_pos == new_l:

                          term = new_l

                      else:

                          term = E[new_l][new_pos]

                  sum_terms = (sum_terms + term) % MOD

              # after summing all terms, multiply by (l / m) * inv(l-1)

              break_coeff = (l * inv[m]) % MOD

              inv_l_minus_1 = inv[l-1]

              break_contrib = (sum_terms * inv_l_minus_1 % MOD) * break_coeff % MOD

          else:

              break_contrib =0

          E[l][pos] = (create_contrib + break_contrib) % MOD

Once all E is filled, the answer is E[n][k].

But wait, in the initial state, the length is n and pos is k. So the code should output E[n][k] mod MOD.

But we need to check if k is 1 or n first. Which we have already done.

So the code structure is:

Read n, k, m.

Check if k is 1 or n. If yes, output n mod MOD.

Else, compute the DP.

Initialize E as a 2D array.

Process l from m down to 1:

   for each pos in 1..l:

      if pos is 1 or l:

          E[l][pos] = l mod MOD.

      else:

          compute create_contrib and break_contrib.

So in code, the loops will be nested.

But in Python, for m=250, the loops will be manageable.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 3:

3 2 3.

Initial length is 3, pos is 2.

The code skips the initial check since 2 is not 1 or 3.

Process l from 3 down to 1.

For l=3, pos=2:

Since l=3 is the maximum m=3, create_contrib is zero.

Break_contrib:

l=3, so l-1=2. i ranges from 1 to 2.

For each i:

i=1:

i=1 < pos=2 → right part is kept. new_l=3-1=2, new_pos=2-1=1. new_pos is 1 → terminal. term=2.

i=2:

i=2 >= pos=2 → left part is kept. new_l=2, new_pos=2. new_l=2, new_pos=2 → terminal. term=2.

sum_terms = 2 + 2 =4.

break_contrib = (4 * inv(2)) * (3 * inv(3)) mod MOD.

inv(2) is 500000004, inv(3) is 333333336.

3 * inv(3) = 1.

break_coeff = 3 * inv(3) = 1.

sum_terms is 4 → 4 * inv(2) = 2 → 2 * 1 = 2 mod MOD.

So E[3][2] = 0 + 2 = 2.

Which matches sample output 3, where the answer is 2.

Yes.

Another sample: input 2 1 2 → output 2. The code skips computation and outputs 2.

Sample 4:

3 2 5 → output 941659828.

But the code should compute this.

Now, for handling the modular inverses and fractions correctly.

But overall, this approach should work.

Potential issues:

- Handling the cases where l+1 exceeds m, but since create can't happen when l == m.

- Handling new_l and new_pos correctly in the break case.

- Modular arithmetic: all operations must be mod MOD.

So in code, every operation that can be modded should be.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The code will need to precompute the inverses, and then process the DP in reverse order.

But for l up to 250, and pos up to 250, the code will use a 2D array of size 251 x 251 (assuming l starts at 0 to 250).

But in Python, perhaps a list of lists can be used.

Now, the code.

First, precompute inverses up to 500.

MOD = 10**9 +7

inv = [1] * (501)
for i in range(2, 501):
    inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD)

Then, read the input.

Testing against sample input 3.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    inv = [1] * 501
    for i in range(2, 501):
        inv[i] = pow(i, MOD-2, MOD)

    n, k, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    if k == 1 or k == n:
        print(n % MOD, file=output_stream)
        return

    E = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(m + 2)]

    for l in range(m, 0, -1):
        for pos in range(1, l + 1):
            if pos == 1 or pos == l:
                E[l][pos] = l % MOD
            else:
                create_contrib = 0
                if l < m:
                    num_less = pos
                    num_more = (l + 1) - pos
                    term1 = (num_less * E[l+1][pos+1]) % MOD
                    term2 = (num_more * E[l+1][pos]) % MOD

Another case: initial pos is not at the ends, but during breaking, the Doctor is moved to the end.

Thus, the code should be correct.
