Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to compute the Levenshtein distance between two strings, but with different costs for the operations. The standard Levenshtein uses unit costs for insert, delete, substitute. But here, substitution cost is the absolute difference between the indices of the characters in the alphabet. Insertion and deletion costs are the index of the character (so inserting 'a' costs 1, 'b' 2, etc.).

Hmm. So for example, substituting 'a' to 'b' would cost 1 (since 2-1=1). Inserting 'a' costs 1, deleting 'a' also 1. So the standard dynamic programming approach for edit distance should still work, but with modified costs.

The problem is to find the minimal total cost to transform one string into the other using these operations. Let's think about the dynamic programming approach.

Let's denote the two strings as A and B. Let's say A has length m and B has length n. We can create a DP table of (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions. The cell dp[i][j] represents the minimal cost to convert the first i characters of A into the first j characters of B.

The base cases would be:
- dp[0][0] = 0 (converting empty to empty)
- dp[i][0] = sum of deletion costs for the first i characters of A. Since each deletion costs the value of the character. So for each step from 0 to i-1, we delete A[k], cost += (A[k-1] - 'a' +1).
Similarly, dp[0][j] = sum of insertion costs for the first j characters of B.

Wait, right. Because when converting to an empty string, you have to delete all characters. And converting from empty to B, you have to insert all.

Then, for the transitions:

For each i and j, we can compute dp[i][j] by considering three possible operations:
1. Insert: Take dp[i][j-1] and add the cost of inserting B[j-1]. Because inserting the j-th character of B to A, which is now at position i (after inserting, the length increases by 1). So cost is insertion cost of B[j-1], which is (ord(B[j-1]) - ord('a') + 1).
2. Delete: Take dp[i-1][j] and add the cost of deleting A[i-1]. Deletion cost is (ord(A[i-1]) - ord('a') +1).
3. Substitute: Take dp[i-1][j-1] and add the substitution cost if A[i-1] != B[j-1], else 0. Substitution cost is the absolute difference between the two characters' indices. For example, A's char is 'a' (index 0) and B's is 'c' (index 2), cost is 2.

So the recursive formula would be:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i-1][j] + delete_cost(A[i-1]),
    dp[i][j-1] + insert_cost(B[j-1]),
    dp[i-1][j-1] + (sub_cost if A[i-1] != B[j-1] else 0)
)

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum length is 100 for each string, so the DP table is 101x101, which is manageable. The time complexity is O(m*n), which for 100x100 is 10,000 operations. That's way under the time constraints even for Python.

So the approach is feasible.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

First, read the two strings. Let's call them s1 and s2. m = len(s1), n = len(s2).

We need to create a 2D DP array. But for space optimization, we can use a 1D array and update it in place, since each row only depends on the previous row and the current row. Let's see:

Wait, in the standard edit distance, we can do this with two rows: previous and current. Because for each cell (i,j), you need the cell above (i-1,j), to the left (i,j-1), and diagonally (i-1,j-1). So using a 1D array where we iterate row by row, but keep track of the previous values. Hmm. Let's see.

Alternatively, using a 2D array is manageable even for 100x100. But for Python, space isn't an issue here. So maybe just use a 2D array.

But let's outline the steps.

Initialize dp as a (m+1) x (n+1) matrix.

First, fill the first row and first column.

For the first row (i=0), each j entry is sum of insertion costs for B's first j characters. So for j from 1 to n, dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + (ord(B[j-1]) - ord('a') +1).

Similarly, first column (j=0), each i entry is sum of deletion costs for A's first i characters. So dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (ord(A[i-1]) - ord('a') +1).

Then, for i from 1 to m:
    for j from 1 to n:
        delete_cost = ord(s1[i-1]) - ord('a') +1
        insert_cost = ord(s2[j-1]) - ord('a') +1
        sub_cost = abs(ord(s1[i-1]) - ord(s2[j-1]))
        if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
            sub = dp[i-1][j-1]
        else:
            sub = dp[i-1][j-1] + sub_cost
        dp[i][j] = min(
            dp[i-1][j] + delete_cost,
            dp[i][j-1] + insert_cost,
            sub
        )

The final answer is dp[m][n].

Let's test this with the first example.

Sample Input 1:
arc
bug

A is "arc" (length 3), B is "bug" (length 3).

The dp table starts as 4x4.

First, fill the first row and first column.

First row (i=0):

dp[0][0] = 0.

j=1: insert 'b' (cost 2). dp[0][1] = 2.

j=2: insert 'u' (cost 21). dp[0][2] = 2+21=23.

j=3: insert 'g' (cost 7). dp[0][3] = 23+7=30.

First column (j=0):

i=1: delete 'a' (cost 1). dp[1][0] = 1.

i=2: delete 'r' (cost 18). dp[2][0] = 1+18=19.

i=3: delete 'c' (cost 3). dp[3][0] = 19+3=22.

Now, filling the rest.

For i=1, j=1:

s1[0] is 'a', s2[0] is 'b'.

Options:

delete 'a' (cost 1 added to dp[0][1] (2) â†’ 1 + 2 = 3? Wait wait. Wait, the delete cost is the cost of deleting 'a', which is 1. So the delete option would take dp[i-1][j] (dp[0][1] is 2) and add 1? No, wait. Wait, the delete operation here is deleting the 'a' (current i is 1, which is the first character of A). So when you delete A's i-th (1st) character, you add the cost of that deletion. So dp[i-1][j] (which is dp[0][1] = 2) plus the deletion cost (1) gives 3.

Insert 'b' (cost 2) added to dp[i][j-1] (dp[1][0] is 1). So 1+2=3.

Substitute 'a' to 'b' (cost 1). So dp[0][0] (0) +1 â†’ 1.

So the minimum of 3 (delete), 3 (insert), 1 (substitute) â†’ 1. So dp[1][1] is 1.

Then proceed for all cells.

But in the first example, the output is 8. Let's see what the final cell would be.

But perhaps the code will compute it correctly. Let's proceed.

Now, how to handle the substitution cost.

Another example: in the first sample, the optimal path is three substitutions. So substituting a->b (cost 1), r->u (cost 3), c->g (cost 4). Total 8. Let's see if the code captures that.

Another approach: Let's check the substitution cost for each pair.

But perhaps the code is correct.

Now, for the implementation.

In Python, to read the two strings, we can do:

s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()

Then, m = len(s1), n = len(s2).

Initialize the DP table. Since in Python, for a 2D list, it's easier to create a list of lists.

But for space optimization, perhaps using a 1D array and updating in place. Let's think.

For the standard edit distance, the 1D approach works by keeping a previous row and current row.

But in our case, each cell depends on the cell above (i-1,j), left (i,j-1), and diagonal (i-1,j-1). So using a 1D array where we process each row and track the previous diagonal value.

Alternatively, for small constraints, a 2D array is manageable. Let's proceed with the 2D approach for clarity.

So code outline:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s1 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    s2 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    m = len(s1)
    n = len(s2)

    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

    # Fill first row (insertions)
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + (ord(s2[j-1]) - ord('a') + 1)

    # Fill first column (deletions)
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (ord(s1[i-1]) - ord('a') + 1)

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            delete = dp[i-1][j] + (ord(s1[i-1]) - ord('a') +1)
            insert = dp[i][j-1] + (ord(s2[j-1]) - ord('a') +1)
            if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
                sub = dp[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                sub = dp[i-1][j-1] + abs(ord(s1[i-1]) - ord(s2[j-1]))
            dp[i][j] = min(delete, insert, sub)

    print(dp[m][n], file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
dome
drone
""",
            "output": \
"""\
19
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Another test case: the second sample input.

Sample Input 2:

dome

drone

So s1 is 'dome' (4 letters), s2 is 'drone' (5 letters).

The output is 19.

The explanation says insert 'r' (cost 18) and replace 'm' with 'n' (cost 1). But let's see.

s1 is 'd', 'o', 'm', 'e' â†’ length 4.

s2 is 'd', 'r', 'o', 'n', 'e' â†’ length5.

So the steps are:

Insert 'r' (cost 18) after 'd', then substitute 'm' with 'n' (cost 1). But how does this fit into the DP.

The optimal path would be:

d â†’ d (no cost), then insert r (18), then o remains, m â†’n (1), e â†’e (0). Total 19.

So the code should calculate this.

But the code would have to account for the insertions and substitutions.

So in the DP table, the code would find that inserting 'r' into s1 (at position 2, perhaps) and then substituting.

But the code should correctly compute this.

So the code seems to handle this.

Now, about space. For m=100 and n=100, the DP table is 101x101, which is 10,201 integers. Each integer is up to the sum of maximum possible costs. The maximum insertion cost per character is 26, and for 100 characters, 26*100=2600. So even for 100x100, the sum can be up to 2600*100=260,000. So each cell is a 4-byte integer (which is manageable). So 10k cells is 40KB, which is way under memory constraints.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, implement it in Python.

But wait, in Python, creating a 2D list is straightforward. So the code is as written before.

Now, let's test the code against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

arc
bug

Expected output:8.

The code's DP for (3,3) is 8. Let's see.

But perhaps it's better to run through the code step by step.

Another thing: when filling the first row and column, the code correctly adds the insertion and deletion costs.

The code seems correct.

So the final code should be as written.

```python
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
m, n = len(s1), len(s2)

# Initialize DP table
dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

# Fill first row (insertions)
for j in range(1, n+1):
    dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + (ord(s2[j-1]) - ord('a') + 1)

# Fill first column (deletions)
for i in range(1, m+1):
    dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (ord(s1[i-1]) - ord('a') + 1)

for i in range(1, m+1):
    for j in range(1, n+1):
        delete = dp[i-1][j] + (ord(s1[i-1]) - ord('a') + 1)
        insert = dp[i][j-1] + (ord(s2[j-1]) - ord('a') + 1)
        sub_cost = abs(ord(s1[i-1]) - ord(s2[j-1]))
        substitute = dp[i-1][j-1] + (0 if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1] else sub_cost)
        dp[i][j] = min(delete, insert, substitute)

print(dp[m][n])
```
