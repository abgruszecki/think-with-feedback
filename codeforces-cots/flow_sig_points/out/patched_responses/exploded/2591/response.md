<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The goal is to find the minimum number of trees to change so that the sequence becomes 'beautiful'. The definition of a beautiful sequence is a bit specific. Let's see: the ends (first and last) must be equal, the next pair (second and second last) must be equal and exactly one more than the first pair, and so on. So, for each position i from the start and its mirror from the end, the value must be the same and each level increases by 1 as we move inward.

Wait, so for example, if the sequence has length 3, then the first and third elements must be equal, and the second must be exactly one more than them. Like in the first example input: 3 trees with all 2s. The beautiful sequence would be 2,3,2. So changing the middle one from 2 to 3, which requires one change. Hence the output is 1.

Another example: when the input is 4 elements 1,2,2,1. The beautiful sequence here would be 1,2,2,1. Wait, but according to the problem's example, the correct output is 0. So that's already a beautiful sequence. Because the first and fourth are 1, the second and third are 2, which is 1+1. So each level increases by 1 as you move from the ends. Yes.

So the problem is to find the minimal number of changes such that the sequence meets this structure.

Now, the challenge is to model the beautiful sequence and find which possible base (the first element's value) and structure (how the values increase as we move inward) leads to the least changes.

Let me think. For a given sequence, the beautiful structure is determined by two parameters: the starting value (let's call it x) and the number of layers (k). For example, in the first example of 3 elements, the starting x is 2, and the layers are 1 (since there's the first and third elements) and the middle element is x+1. The layers here are determined by the structure of the sequence.

Wait, the layers are based on the distance from the ends. For each position i (0-based?), the required value is x + d, where d is the distance from the start. Wait no: for the first and last elements, their distance from the edge is 0, so their value is x. Then the next pair (second and penultimate) have a distance of 1, so x+1, and so on.

So for a sequence of length n, the maximum possible layers is (n+1)//2. For example, if n is 3, the layers are 0 (the first and third elements) and 1 (the middle element). The middle element's distance is 1 from the edge. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of how the layers are arranged.

Alternatively, for each position i in the array (0-based), the distance from the edge is the minimum of i and (n-1 - i). Wait, no. For example, in a sequence of length 4:

indices 0,1,2,3. For each index, the distance from the edge is the layer. So for index 0 and 3, layer 0. For 1 and 2, layer 1. Each layer must have value x + layer. So the value at position i must be x + (layer of i).

So, the beautiful sequence is determined by x (the base value for layer 0) and the layers. Each layer's value is x + layer. Then, for all positions in the same layer, their values must be x + layer. The layers are determined by the structure of the array's symmetry.

So for a given x and the array, we can calculate how many positions already satisfy the required value (x + their layer), and thus the minimal changes would be n minus the maximum count of positions that satisfy any possible x and their layer assignments.

But how do we find possible x values and check them efficiently?

But considering that n can be up to 1e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

The key observation is that for each position i, the possible x is (a[i] - layer_i), where layer_i is the layer of i. Because the required x must be such that x + layer_i = a[i], so x = a[i] - layer_i. But since x has to be positive (since all tree heights must be positive after changes), x must be at least 1.

So, for each position i, the x that would make a[i] fit into the beautiful sequence without changing it is (a[i] - layer_i). So for each position i, we can compute a possible x candidate, then check how many positions in the array would fit into a beautiful sequence with that x. The maximum such count will give the minimal changes (since the minimal changes is n - maximum count).

So the approach is:

1. For each position i in the array, compute the layer of i (layer_i = min(i, (n-1) - i) for 0-based? Wait, let's see: for a 0-based array, the left distance is i steps from the start, the right distance is (n-1 - i) steps from the end. So the layer is the minimum of these two. For example, in a 4-element array, positions 0 and 3 are layer 0, 1 and 2 are layer 1. In a 3-element array, positions 0 and 2 are layer 0, position 1 is layer 1 (since min(1, 1) is 1).

Wait, for 0-based index i in a 3-element array (indices 0,1,2):

i=0: min(0, 2) = 0 (layer 0)
i=1: min(1, 1) =1 (layer 1)
i=2: min(2,0) =0 (layer 0)

So for position 1 (middle), the layer is 1. So the required value is x + 1. The first and third positions are x. So for example, the beautiful sequence would be x, x+1, x.

So in this case, for each x, the values are as follows.

So, for each position i, x must be a[i] - layer_i. But x must be at least 1, because the value after changes must be positive. So if a[i] - layer_i is less than 1, then that x is invalid, so this position cannot contribute to any valid x.

Thus, the algorithm steps would be:

- For each position i, compute the layer (layer_i = min(i, n-1 -i)), since the array is 0-based.

- For each position i, compute possible x = a[i] - layer_i. If x is >=1, then this x is a candidate. For each such x, we need to count how many positions j in the array have a[j] == x + layer_j (since for those j's, their a[j] is already correct for this x, so no change is needed).

- The maximum count among all valid x's is the maximum number of positions that can remain unchanged. The answer is n - max_count.

But the problem is that for each x candidate (which could be up to O(n) candidates), we need to count how many positions j have a[j] == x + layer_j. If we do this naively, it's O(n^2), which is way too slow for n=1e5.

Thus, we need a way to compute the frequencies of x candidates and for each x, the count is the sum over all positions j where x + layer_j == a[j]. Wait, but x is a[i] - layer_i for some i. Wait, perhaps for each x, the count is the number of positions j where a[j] - layer_j == x and x >=1.

So the count for x is the number of positions j where (a[j] - layer_j) equals x and x >=1.

Therefore, we can precompute for all positions j, the value (a[j] - layer_j), and build a frequency dictionary (like a Counter) that maps each x to the number of positions j where a[j] - layer_j is x. Then, for each x in this Counter, if x is >=1, the count is the value in the Counter. The maximum of these counts is the maximum number of positions that can be kept unchanged. The answer is n minus this maximum.

But wait, this is not accurate. Because the x must be the same for all layers. For example, for x to be valid, all positions in their layers must have x + layer_i. So if we count all j where a[j] - layer_j ==x, then that's exactly the positions that would fit into a beautiful sequence with base x. So the maximum frequency of x (among those x >=1) is the maximum number of positions that can be left unmodified. Thus, the minimal changes is n minus that maximum.

Yes! Because for each x, the number of positions j where a[j] - layer_j ==x is the number of positions that can be kept as is if x is chosen as the base. So the x with the highest frequency (and x>=1) is the best choice. Thus, the answer is n minus the maximum frequency of such x (as long as x is >=1).

Ah! So the solution is:

1. For each position j, compute the layer (layer_j = min(j, (n-1) - j) in 0-based index).

2. For each position j, compute x_j = a[j] - layer_j.

3. Count the frequency of each x_j. But we only consider x_j >=1.

4. The maximum frequency found (max_count) is the maximum number of positions that can be kept. So the answer is n - max_count.

But wait, this approach assumes that for a given x, all the positions j that have x_j =x can form a valid beautiful sequence. But is that the case?

For example, suppose x is fixed, then for each position j, the required value is x + layer_j. But in the beautiful sequence, the structure must satisfy that for each pair (i, n-1-i), their layers are the same, and their values must be equal. Because the layers are min(i, n-1-i), which is the same for both. So the required value for both positions is x + layer_i. So if the positions j have a[j] = x + layer_j, then all the required pairs are equal. So this approach works.

So, the algorithm is correct.

Now, let's test this with the examples.

First example:

Input:
3
2 2 2

Compute layers for each position:

n=3, 0-based indexes 0,1,2.

layer_0: min(0, 2) =0.

layer_1: min(1, 1) =1.

layer_2: min(2,0) =0.

x_j for each j:

x_0 = 2 -0 =2.

x_1=2-1=1.

x_2=2-0=2.

So x_j values are 2,1,2. So the frequency is:

1:1, 2:2.

But x must be >=1. So max frequency is 2 (for x=2). So the answer is 3-2=1. Which matches the first example.

Second example:

4
1 2 2 1

layers:

indexes 0: min(0, 3)=0.

index1: min(1,2)=1.

index2: min(2,1)=1.

index3: min(3,0)=0.

x_j:

0: 1 -0=1.

1:2-1=1.

2:2-1=1.

3:1-0=1.

So all x_j are 1. frequency is 4. So answer is 4-4=0. Correct.

Another test case: say input is 1. Then layer is 0. So x_j is a[0]-0. If a[0] is >=1, then answer is 0. If a[0] is 0 (but according to the problem statement, a[i] is >=1. So for n=1, the answer is 0 (since the sequence is already x, which is a[0], and x must be >=1).

Another example: input 4, 1 3 3 1. The x_j would be:

0:1-0=1.

1:3-1=2.

2:3-1=2.

3:1-0=1.

So frequencies: 1:2, 2:2. So max is 2. Answer is 4-2=2. Because the beautiful sequence would have x=1, leading to 1,2,2,1 (requires changing positions 1 and 2 from 3 to 2. Which requires 2 changes. Or if x=2, the sequence would be 2,3,3,2. But then the first and fourth elements would be 2. Then the second and third would be 3, which is x+1=3. But the current elements are 3 and 3, which matches. So in this case, the count would be 2 (positions 1 and 2) and 1 (positions 0 and 3 have x=1 and x=2. So the maximum between x=1 and x=2. For x=1, the count is positions 0 and 3 (x_j=1) and positions 1 and 2 would have x_j=2, which is different. So the count for x=1 is 2, for x=2 it's 2. So the answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. The original sequence is 1,3,3,1. The minimal changes would be 2: change positions 1 and 2 to 2 and 2 (if x=1), which would give 1,2,2,1. So yes.

So the algorithm works.

Now, the steps are:

1. For each tree in the array, compute its layer.

2. For each tree, compute x = a[i] - layer. If x >=1, then x is a candidate.

3. Count the frequency of each x (only if x >=1). The maximum frequency is the maximum number of trees that can be kept. The answer is n minus that maximum.

So, in code:

Read n.

Read a as a list.

Compute layers for each index.

Compute x for each a[i], check x >=1.

Use a dictionary or Counter to count the frequency of x.

Find the maximum frequency (or 0 if no x is valid).

The answer is n - max_freq.

But what if all x are invalid (x <1)? Then in that case, all trees must be changed. For example, if all a[i] - layer[i] <1, then the maximum frequency is zero, and answer is n.

But the problem states that after changes, the height must be positive. So the x must be at least 1, because the first layer (layer 0) must have x >=1. Because the first and last elements (layer 0) have value x. So x must be >=1.

Thus, in code:

max_count is the maximum frequency in the Counter where x >=1. If there are no such x, then all trees must be changed. For example, if the input is 1, and a[0] is 0 (but according to problem constraints, a[i] is at least 1, so this case is impossible). So in code, the Counter might have x's that are >=1, or not. If not, then all x are invalid, so all trees must be changed. So answer is n.

But how to handle that?

In code, after building the Counter, we can check all keys in the Counter, filter those >=1, take their counts, and find the maximum. If there are none, then max_count is 0, so answer is n - 0 = n.

Wait no. For example, if all x are invalid (x <1), then the best possible x is such that x >=1, but no positions have a[j] - layer_j ==x. So we have to choose x >=1, and then for all positions j, a[j] must be changed to x + layer_j. So the number of changes is n.

But how? For example, if n is 3, and all a[i] - layer[i] are 0. Then x can be 1. Then all trees need to be changed. So the answer is 3.

So in code:

Compute for each position i, x_i = a[i] - layer[i].

We create a frequency counter of x_i's where x_i >=1.

The max_count is the maximum value in this counter, or 0 if there are none.

Then the answer is n - max_count.

Yes.

So the code will be:

Read n.

a = list of integers.

layers = [min(i, (n-1)-i) for i in range(n)]

x_list = [a[i] - layer for i, layer in enumerate(layers)]

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter()

for x in x_list:

    if x >=1:

        counter[x] +=1

if counter:

    max_freq = max(counter.values())

else:

    max_freq = 0

answer = n - max_freq

print(answer)

Wait, but even if there are no x >=1, the code will set max_freq to 0. So answer is n-0 =n. Which is correct.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, *rest = map(int, input_stream.read().split())
    a = rest[:n]
    
    layers = [min(i, (n-1) - i) for i in range(n)]
    x_counter = defaultdict(int)
    
    for i in range(n):
        layer = layers[i]
        x = a[i] - layer
        if x >= 1:
            x_counter[x] += 1
    
    max_freq = max(x_counter.values()) if x_counter else 0
    print(n - max_freq, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4
1 2 2 1
""",
            "output": \
"""\
0
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example: x_list is [1,1,1,1]. max_freq 4. answer 0.

Another test case: n=1, a=[1]. layer is 0. x=1. counter is {1:1}. answer is 0.

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1]. layers are 0,1,0. x_list is [1,0,1]. So counter counts x >=1: 1 occurs 2 times (positions 0 and 2), and position 1's x is 0 (invalid). So max_freq is 2. answer is 3-2=1. The beautiful sequence would be x=1, which requires the middle element to be x+1=2. So change the middle one.

Yes.

Another test case: n=2, a=[1,1]. layers are 0,0. x_list is 1-0=1 and 1-0=1. counter {1:2}. answer 2-2=0. So the sequence is already beautiful (1,1) which meets the condition of first and last being equal (they are the same), and each layer increases by 1. Wait, but for n=2, layer is 0 for both. So the required value is x=1 for both. Which matches. So the answer is 0. Correct.

So this code should handle all cases.

Now, let's think about the time and space constraints.

n can be up to 1e5. The code is O(n) time and space. For Python, this is acceptable. But using list comprehensions and a Counter is acceptable.

But in Python, even for 1e5 elements, the Counter will handle it, as it's O(n) time.

Yes. So the code is optimal.

So the final code is as described.
