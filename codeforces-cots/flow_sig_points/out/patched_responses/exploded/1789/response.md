Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement says that we need to process queries where each query gives a number k, and we need to determine the largest possible minimum of the array after exactly k operations. The operations are a bit tricky. Let's try to understand what's happening here.

So, each operation is numbered starting from 1. Each operation involves selecting an element. If it's red, you add i (the operation number) to it and it becomes blue. If it's blue, you subtract i and it becomes red. Initially, all elements are red. The key here is that the operations can be applied multiple times to the same element, but each operation is part of a sequence (i starts at 1 and increases by 1 each time).

The goal is, after exactly k operations, to maximize the minimal element in the array. Since we can choose which elements to apply the operations on, we need to find the optimal way to distribute these operations to maximize the minimum.

First, let's model how applying operations affects each element. Let's think about an individual element. Let's say we apply m operations to it. How does its value change?

Each time we apply an operation to the element, it alternates between red and blue. The initial state is red. So the first operation (i1) adds i1 and turns it blue. The next operation (i2) subtracts i2 and turns it red again. Then the third operation (i3) adds i3, and so on.

Wait, but the operations are applied in sequence. So the i's are 1, 2, 3, etc., and each operation is part of the sequence. So for a given element, if it's operated on m times, the sequence of i's that affect it depends on which operations were applied to it. But the order matters here.

This seems complicated. Let's think of the total effect on an element when it's been operated on m times. Let's consider the sum of the operations applied to it. Since the element alternates between red and blue, the effect is a sum where each operation alternates between adding and subtracting, starting with add.

For example, if the operations applied to the element are in positions i1, i2, ..., im (in the order of execution), then the net effect would be (i1 - i2 + i3 - i4 + ... Â± im). Wait, no. Because each operation's effect depends on the current color. Let me think again:

The initial color is red. So the first operation (i1) adds i1 and turns blue. The second operation (i2) subtracts i2 and turns red. Third (i3) adds i3, etc. So for m operations, the total added to the element's original value is:

sum_{t=1 to m} (-1)^(t+1) * i_t

Wait, yes. Because for the first operation (t=1), it's +i1. For the second (t=2), it's -i2. Third (t=3) +i3, and so on. So the total delta is sum_{t=1 to m} (-1)^(t+1) * i_t.

But the problem is, the sequence of i's (the operation numbers) depends on the order in which the element is chosen. For example, if an element is chosen in operations 1, 3, and 5, then the delta is +1 -3 +5. If it's chosen in 1,2,5, then the delta is +1 -2 +5. So the order in which the operations are applied to the element affects the sum.

But since we can choose any elements to apply each operation, the key is that for each element, we can choose the set of operations applied to it (the positions in the sequence of k operations) to maximize the element's value. But since we are trying to maximize the minimal element, perhaps we need to distribute the operations in a way that benefits the minimum elements the most.

But how do we model this?

Alternative approach: For each element, the maximum possible value it can have after being operated on m times (using m operations) is determined by the sum of the largest possible operations in such a way that the sign alternates. Because to maximize the delta, we want the largest possible positive contributions and the smallest possible negative contributions.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: if m is even, the sum would be (i1 - i2) + (i3 - i4) + ... + (i_{m-1} - i_m}). If m is odd, it's (i1 - i2) + ... + i_m.

To maximize this sum, we need to select the largest possible i's for the positive terms and the smallest possible i's for the negative terms. For example, for even m, group the operations into pairs where the first is a large i and the second is a small i. But how can we arrange that when the operations are chosen from the first k operations (since total k operations are applied across all elements)?

Wait, perhaps each operation can be assigned to any element. So each element's m_i (number of operations applied to it) is such that the sum of m_i over all elements is k. And for each element, the delta is the sum of terms based on the sequence of operations applied to it. But since the operations are numbered 1 to k, each individual operation is part of the global sequence.

Wait, no. The problem states that exactly k operations are performed. Each operation is part of the sequence 1 to k. For each operation i (1-based), you choose any element to apply it. So the sequence is fixed: the first operation is i=1, then i=2, up to i=k. Each of these must be applied to some element. The order in which the elements are chosen for these operations can affect the delta for each element.

This seems very complex. Because for an element that is chosen in operations i1, i2, ..., im, the delta is sum_{t=1 to m} (-1)^(t+1) * i_t. So the order in which the element is chosen for the operations affects the delta.

But how can we model this optimally? It's not obvious. Let's see if there's a pattern here.

Suppose we have a set of m operations applied to an element, in the order they were chosen. The delta is the sum as before. But perhaps the optimal way to maximize the delta is to assign the largest possible i's to the positions where they are added (odd t) and the smallest possible i's to the positions where they are subtracted (even t). But how to arrange that.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum delta for an element when it is operated on m times is equal to the sum of the first ceil(m/2) largest operations minus the sum of the next floor(m/2) largest operations. Let me see:

For example, if m is 3, then we have +i1 -i2 +i3. To maximize this sum, we want i1 and i3 to be as large as possible, and i2 to be as small as possible. But since the i's are the operation numbers (from 1 to k), but each operation can be applied to any element. Wait, but each operation can be assigned to any element, but each operation is used exactly once. So for the entire k operations, each of the i's (from 1 to k) is assigned to some element.

So the problem is to assign each of the first k operations (i=1 to i=k) to elements, possibly the same element multiple times, such that exactly k operations are done. For each element, the order in which the operations are applied (the sequence of i's assigned to it) affects its delta. But to maximize the minimal element, we need to arrange these operations in a way that the delta for each element is as large as possible, but with the goal of making the minimal element as high as possible.

This seems very challenging, especially given that k can be up to 1e9 and n up to 1e3. How can we compute this efficiently?

Alternative approach: For each element, determine the maximum possible delta it can have when assigned m operations (summing to k across all elements). Then, given the array of a_i plus these deltas, the minimal element is the answer. We need to choose m for each element such that sum(m) = k and the minimal (a_i + delta_i) is as large as possible.

But the problem is that the delta for each element depends on how the m operations are arranged. To maximize the delta for a given m, what's the maximum possible delta that can be achieved?

Let me think about this. For a given m (number of operations applied to an element), what is the maximum possible delta that can be achieved, given that each operation is chosen from the first k operations, and each operation is used exactly once across all elements.

Wait, but in this problem, the k in the query is the total number of operations. So for each query k, we have to choose exactly k operations (i=1 to i=k) and assign them to elements. But since each query is independent, this is a separate problem for each k.

But given that k can be up to 1e9, and there are up to 1e3 queries, we need an O(1) or O(log something) approach per query, possibly after some preprocessing.

Hmm. Let's think about the maximum possible delta for an element when it is operated on m times. The operations assigned to it must be a subset of the first k operations (since the query is for exactly k operations). But to maximize the delta, the subset must be chosen such that the sum of terms (-1)^(t+1) * i_t is maximized.

Wait, but the problem is that the assignment of operations to elements must be such that all operations from 1 to k are used. So for a query with k, the sum of m_i over all elements is exactly k. So the problem reduces to distributing the first k operations among the elements, such that the minimal a_i plus delta_i is as large as possible.

This seems like a problem where we can model the delta for each element as a function of m_i (the number of operations applied to it). Then, we need to choose m_i's such that sum(m_i) = k and the minimal (a_i + delta_i) is maximized.

But the delta for m_i depends on which operations are chosen for the element. To maximize the delta, for each m_i, the maximum possible delta is the sum of the first ceil(m_i/2) largest available operations minus the sum of the next floor(m_i/2) largest available operations.

Wait, because for the element, to maximize the delta, we want as many high operations as possible in the positions where they are added (odd positions in the sequence) and as few high operations as possible in the positions where they are subtracted (even positions). So, for example, if m is the number of operations on this element, then the delta is (sum of the largest m_add operations) - (sum of the next m_sub operations), where m_add is ceil(m / 2) and m_sub is floor(m / 2).

But the available operations are the first k operations. So for the entire array, when distributing the operations, each operation from 1 to k is used exactly once. Thus, the elements can't share operations. So the problem is to assign each of the first k operations to elements, in a way that for each element, the operations assigned to it are arranged to maximize the delta. Then, the minimal a_i plus delta_i is the answer.

But how can we model this? Let's consider that for each element, the maximum delta for m operations is the sum of the largest ceil(m/2) operations assigned to it minus the sum of the largest floor(m/2) operations. But how do we choose these operations from the first k operations?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to assign operations is as follows: for all elements, the operations assigned to them are the largest possible ones, sorted in a way that maximizes their delta. But since the elements are competing for the same pool of operations (1 to k), this becomes a problem of optimally partitioning the operations.

Wait, perhaps this can be viewed as for each element, the contribution of m operations (m being the number assigned to it) is given by some function f(m), which depends on the sum of certain subsets of the first k operations. Then, the problem reduces to choosing m_i's such that sum(m_i) = k and the minimal a_i + f_i(m_i) is maximized.

But how do we compute f_i(m_i) for each element and possible m_i?

Alternatively, for each element i, and possible m (number of operations applied to it), the maximum possible delta is computed as follows: choose m operations from the first k operations, such that when arranged in the best possible order (maximizing the delta), the sum is as large as possible.

But how?

This seems very challenging. Let's think for a moment: when the element is assigned m operations, to maximize its delta, the best possible scenario is to select the largest possible m_add operations (where m_add is ceil(m/2)) to be added, and the smallest possible m_sub operations (floor(m/2)) to be subtracted.

Wait, but that's assuming that the operations are assigned in a way that the added ones are as large as possible and the subtracted ones are as small as possible. So for example, if m is 3 (ceil(3/2) = 2 added, floor(3/2) = 1 subtracted), then the delta would be (sum of two largest operations) minus (sum of the next largest operation). But how is that possible? Because the operations are arranged in a sequence where the element is alternately added and subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the order of applying operations to the element can be arranged to maximize the delta. For example, if we have three operations assigned to the element: the largest (say x), then the smallest (y), then the next largest (z), then the delta would be x - y + z. But if we arrange them as x, z, y, then the delta is x - z + y. Hmm, that's worse. So to maximize the sum, for m operations, we should arrange the operations in such a way that the largest m_add operations are in the odd positions (added) and the next largest m_sub are in the even positions (subtracted). 

But how can we model this? For example, for m operations assigned to an element, the optimal delta is the sum of the largest m_add operations minus the sum of the largest m_sub operations. Because in the optimal arrangement, the first operation (added) is the largest possible, then the second (subtracted) is the smallest possible (so that the subtraction is minimal), then the third (added) is the next largest, and so on. So for m_add added steps and m_sub subtracted steps, the total delta is sum of the m_add largest operations in the assigned set minus sum of the m_sub largest operations in the assigned set. But wait, how does that work? For example, if m=3 (m_add=2, m_sub=1), then the sum is (sum of largest two) - (sum of next largest one). But how can we arrange the operations to achieve this? Let's see:

Suppose the three operations assigned are a, b, c (sorted as a >= b >= c). Then, the optimal order is a (add), c (subtract), b (add). So the delta is a - c + b = (a + b) - c. Which is (sum of two largest) minus the smallest. But in this case, the subtracted term is the smallest of the three. So the delta is sum of the first two (added) minus the third (subtracted). So the delta is (a + b) - c. But in this case, m_sub is 1, so we subtract the smallest of the three. So for m operations, the delta is (sum of m_add largest) - (sum of m_sub smallest in the assigned set). But how to choose which operations are assigned to each element.

Alternatively, perhaps for an element with m operations, the delta is the sum of the largest m_add operations assigned to it minus the sum of the smallest m_sub operations assigned to it. Because when you arrange the operations in the order of adding the largest, subtracting the smallest, adding the next largest, subtracting the next smallest, etc., you get the maximum possible delta. So for example, m=4 (m_add=2, m_sub=2), the delta would be (sum of two largest) - (sum of two smallest). The order would be add largest, subtract smallest, add next largest, subtract next smallest.

This way, the sum is maximized. So the key insight here is that for a given m, the maximum delta is (sum of the first m_add largest in the assigned set) minus (sum of the first m_sub smallest in the assigned set).

But how do these assigned sets interact between elements? Because each element's assigned operations must be a subset of the first k operations (for query k), and all elements' assigned sets are disjoint. So the total sum of m_i for all elements is k.

So the problem becomes: assign to each element a subset of the first k operations (so that all subsets are disjoint and their union is the first k operations), such that for each element, the delta is (sum of m_add largest in its subset) minus (sum of m_sub smallest in its subset), where m is the size of the subset, m_add = ceil(m/2), m_sub = floor(m/2). Then, the minimal a_i + delta_i is as large as possible.

But given that k can be up to 1e9, we need an approach that doesn't involve enumerating all possible subsets. This suggests that there's a mathematical pattern or formula that can be derived for the optimal delta given m_i.

Wait, but for each element, the maximum possible delta given m_i operations (from the first k) is a function of m_i. Let's model this function. Let's say for element i, the delta is f_i(m_i) = sum of the largest s = ceil(m_i/2) numbers in a subset of size m_i, minus the sum of the smallest t = floor(m_i/2) numbers in that subset.

But the subsets for all elements are from the first k numbers. So the problem is to partition the first k numbers into subsets, one per element, such that the sum of their sizes is k, and then compute the minimal a_i + f_i(m_i) and maximize this minimal value.

But how can we model this? For example, when we have the first k numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., k), the sum of their values up to k is k(k+1)/2. But each element's subset is a collection of numbers from this set.

But the key observation here is that the best way to maximize the minimal a_i + f_i(m_i) is to assign the largest possible operations (the largest i's) to the elements that need them the most. For example, elements with lower a_i will benefit more from higher deltas. So perhaps we can model this as a binary search problem, where we guess a value x and check if it's possible to assign the operations such that each a_i + delta_i >= x.

But how to compute delta_i for each element given x, and whether it's possible with k operations.

Alternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the maximum x such that the sum of the minimal required operations (to achieve a delta of x - a_i) for each element is <= k. But I'm not sure how to model the delta in terms of x.

Alternatively, perhaps binary search on x: for each x, compute the minimal number of operations required to ensure that each a_i's delta is at least (x - a_i). Then, if the sum of these minimal operations is <=k, x is possible.

But how to compute the minimal number of operations required for a_i to reach at least x.

But this requires for each element i, determining the minimal m_i such that the maximum possible delta for m_i operations is at least (x - a_i). Then sum all m_i and see if it's <=k.

But how to compute the maximum possible delta for a given m_i. Let's model the maximum delta as a function of m.

Let's think about the maximum possible delta for an element when given m operations. The best possible scenario is to take the largest m operations (from 1 to some K) and arrange them in a way that gives the maximum delta. Wait, but for the query k, we have to use exactly k operations, which are 1 to k. So when k is given, the available operations are 1 to k.

But for the purpose of computing the maximum delta for m_i operations, the best delta is obtained by taking the largest m_i operations, then splitting them into s = ceil(m_i/2) and t = floor(m_i/2), and delta is (sum of s largest in the subset) - (sum of t smallest in the subset).

Wait, no. Because the subset of m_i operations assigned to the element is a subset of the first k operations. To maximize the delta, we need the subset to consist of the largest possible m_i operations. Because using larger numbers gives a higher sum when added and subtracted. So for example, if we choose the m_i largest numbers from 1 to k, then split them into s and t, sum the s largest and subtract the sum of the t smallest in the subset.

So for m_i operations, the maximum possible delta is the sum of the largest s numbers in the m_i largest numbers of the first k operations, minus the sum of the smallest t numbers in those m_i numbers.

But wait, if we take the m_i largest operations (say, the numbers from (k - m_i + 1) to k), then split them into s = ceil(m_i /2) and t = floor(m_i/2), the delta is sum of the largest s numbers minus sum of the smallest t numbers in this subset.

For example, if m_i is 3, then s=2, t=1. The subset is the three largest numbers: (k-2, k-1, k). The sum of the largest two (k-1 and k) minus the smallest one (k-2) gives (k-1 +k) - (k-2) = 2k-1 -k +2 = k+1.

Alternatively, if m_i is 4, then s=2, t=2. The sum of the two largest (k-1 +k) minus sum of the two smallest (k-3 + k-2) = (2k-1) - (2k-5) =4.

Hmm, this seems to be the case. So the maximum possible delta for m_i operations (assuming the element is assigned the m_i largest possible operations) is:

delta_i(m_i) = sum of (k - m_i + s + 1 ... k) - sum of (k - m_i + 1 ... k - m_i + t) )

where s = ceil(m_i/2), t = floor(m_i/2).

Wait, let's see. For example, if m_i is 3 and k is 10. The largest 3 operations are 8,9,10. s=2, t=1. The sum of the largest 2 (9+10) =19, minus the sum of the smallest 1 (8) gives 11. So delta is 11.

So for m_i operations, the maximum delta is sum of s largest in the top m_i of k, minus sum of t smallest in the top m_i.

So the sum can be computed as the sum from (k - m_i + t +1) to k) minus sum from (k - m_i +1) to (k - m_i + t).

Wait, no. Wait, the subset of m_i largest numbers is [k - m_i + 1, k - m_i + 2, ..., k]. The s largest in this subset are the last s numbers: (k - s + 1) to k. The t smallest in this subset are the first t numbers: (k - m_i + 1) to (k - m_i + t).

So delta_i(m_i) = sum_{i= k - s +1}^k i - sum_{i= k - m_i +1}^{k - m_i + t} i.

But since s + t = m_i. So s = ceil(m_i/2), t = floor(m_i/2).

So this can be rewritten as:

sum_{i= k - ceil(m_i/2) +1}^k i - sum_{i= k - m_i +1}^{k - m_i + floor(m_i/2)} i.

This is the maximum possible delta for an element when assigned m_i operations. Because we are using the m_i largest available operations (from the first k), and arranging them in the best possible way (so that the added operations are the largest possible and subtracted are the smallest possible in the subset).

So, given that, for each query k, and for each element i, the maximum delta possible when it is assigned m_i operations (with sum(m_i) =k) is as above. Then, the problem reduces to finding a set of m_i's such that sum(m_i) =k and the minimal (a_i + delta_i(m_i)) is maximized.

This seems manageable. But how to compute this efficiently, given that k can be up to 1e9 and q can be up to 1e3.

The approach would be:

For each query k_j, compute the maximum x such that there exists a way to assign m_i's to each element (summing to k_j) where each a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x.

This is a classic binary search problem. For each query k_j, we can binary search on x. For each candidate x, we need to compute the minimal number of operations required for each element to reach at least x, and see if the sum of these minimal operations is <=k_j.

But wait, the problem is to find the maximum x such that there exists a way to assign m_i's (summing to k_j) where all a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x. But since the assignments can vary, we need to find the minimal sum of m_i's required to achieve all a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x, and check if this sum is <=k_j.

So for a given x, compute for each element i the minimal m_i such that a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x. Sum these m_i's. If the sum is <=k_j, then x is feasible. We want the maximum x where this holds.

But how to compute delta_i(m_i) for each i and x.

So the steps would be:

For each query k:

1. Binary search on x between the current possible minimum and maximum.

2. For each x, compute for each element i the minimal m_i needed to have a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x.

3. Sum all m_i's. If sum <=k, x is feasible.

4. The largest feasible x is the answer.

But how to compute m_i for each element i and x.

So for each element i, given x, we need to find the smallest m_i such that a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x.

delta_i(m_i) is a function that, given m_i and k, returns the maximum possible delta for that element. As per earlier, it's the sum of s largest in the top m_i of k, minus sum of t smallest in the top m_i of k.

But when we are considering a particular query k_j, the available operations are 1..k_j. So for the query k_j, the available top m_i numbers are the highest m_i numbers in 1..k_j.

Thus, for the query k_j, when considering element i, the delta_i(m_i) is computed as:

sum of s largest (ceil(m_i/2)) numbers in [k_j -m_i +1, k_j] minus sum of t smallest (floor(m_i/2)) numbers in [k_j -m_i +1, k_j].

But this seems computationally expensive to calculate for each m_i and k_j, especially when k_j can be up to 1e9.

But perhaps there's a way to model this sum with a formula.

Let's try to find a formula for delta_i(m_i, k_j):

Let's denote s = ceil(m_i /2), t = floor(m_i/2) = m_i - s.

The sum of s largest numbers in [k_j - m_i +1 ...k_j] is the sum from (k_j - s +1) to k_j.

The sum of the t smallest numbers in [k_j - m_i +1 ...k_j] is the sum from (k_j -m_i +1) to (k_j -m_i + t).

The sum of consecutive integers from a to b is (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)*a/2) = (b^2 +b -a^2 +a)/2 = (b -a +1)(a + b)/2.

So sum from a to b is S = (a + b) * (b - a + 1) // 2.

So delta_i(m_i, k_j) can be written as:

sum_high = ( (k_j - s +1 + k_j) * s ) // 2 

sum_low = ( ( (k_j - m_i +1 ) + (k_j - m_i + t) ) * t ) // 2 

delta = sum_high - sum_low

So the total delta is sum_high - sum_low.

Now, for each element i, given k_j and x, we need to find the smallest m_i such that a_i + (sum_high - sum_low) >=x.

But how do we compute m_i for this?

This is a function that increases with m_i. Because as m_i increases, the sum_high increases and sum_low also increases, but sum_high increases by larger steps. So delta_i(m_i) is not necessarily monotonic. Wait, but when m_i increases, the total number of operations assigned to the element increases, but how does the delta change?

Let's think for m_i and m_i+1.

For example, for m_i=2, the sum_high is (k -1 +k) = 2k-1, sum_low is (k-2 +1) = k-1. delta = (2k-1) - (k-1) =k.

For m_i=3: s=2, t=1. sum_high is (k-1 +k) = 2k-1, sum_low is (k-3 +1) = k-2. delta= 2k-1 - (k-2) =k+1.

For m_i=4: s=2, t=2. sum_high is (k-1 +k) *2/2 = 2k-1. sum_low is sum from (k-4+1) to (k-4 +2) â (k-3) + (k-2) = 2k-5. delta = (2k-1) - (2k-5) =4.

Wait, but this shows that for m_i=4 and k=4, delta is 4. For m_i=3, delta is 4+1=5. So delta is increasing with m_i here. But when m_i increases beyond a certain point, the delta may decrease.

Hmm. This suggests that the function delta_i(m_i) is not monotonic. But perhaps for a fixed k_j, delta_i(m_i) is non-decreasing with m_i. Let's check.

Take k_j=5:

m_i=1 â s=1, t=0. sum_high=5. sum_low=0. delta=5.

m_i=2 â s=1, t=1. sum_high=5. sum_low=4. delta=1.

m_i=3 â s=2, t=1. sum_high=5+4=9. sum_low=3. delta=6.

m_i=4 â s=2, t=2. sum_high=5+4=9. sum_low=2+3=5. delta=4.

m_i=5 â s=3, t=2. sum_high=5+4+3=12. sum_low=1+2=3. delta=9.

So here, for m_i=2, delta is 1. For m_i=3, it's 6. So it's increasing. Then for m_i=4, it's 4 (which is lower than 6). Then for m_i=5, delta is 9. So the delta increases again. So the function is not monotonic. 

So for a given k_j, delta_i(m_i) can have peaks and valleys as m_i increases. This complicates the problem, as the minimal m_i required to achieve a_i + delta_i >=x may not be found via binary search.

But perhaps for practical purposes, for large k_j, the delta increases up to a certain m_i and then starts to decrease. But this makes the function non-monotonic. So finding the minimal m_i for each element i and x is challenging.

But given the constraints (n and q up to 1e3), perhaps for each element i and query k_j, we can precompute delta_i(m_i, k_j) for m_i up to some maximum possible value (like up to k_j), but this is not feasible for k_j up to 1e9.

Alternative idea: precompute for each element i and possible m_i, what is the required x. But again, not feasible.

Alternative approach: for each query k, the maximum possible delta for an element i with m_i operations is a function that depends on the value of m_i. We can model this function and find the minimal m_i required for a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x.

But given that delta_i(m_i) may not be monotonic, it's difficult to find m_i for a given x.

Hmm. Maybe the function is not monotonic, but for a fixed k_j, the maximum possible delta for m_i operations increases as m_i increases up to a point, then decreases, then increases again. But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps for even m_i, the delta is lower than for odd m_i. Because adding an operation (making m_i odd) allows you to add a larger number. So for example, when m_i is even, adding one more operation (making it odd) may result in a higher delta.

But this is just a hypothesis. Let's see with k=5:

m_i=2 (even): delta is 5+4 - (3+2) â 9-5=4?

Wait, no. For m_i=2, the subset is [4,5]. s=1 (ceil(2/2)), t=1. sum_high is [5], sum_low is [4]. delta is 5-4=1.

Hmm. So for m_i=2, delta is 1. For m_i=3, delta is 5+4 -3=6. For m_i=4, sum_high is 5+4 (s=2), sum_low is 2+3 (t=2). delta is 9-5=4. For m_i=5, sum_high is 5+4+3 (s=3), sum_low is 1+2 (t=2). delta is 12-3=9.

So for even m_i, the delta is lower than for the next odd m_i. So perhaps the maximum delta for even m_i is higher when m_i is increased to the next odd.

But how can this help us? It suggests that for any even m, delta(m) < delta(m+1). So to achieve a certain x, it's better to take an odd m_i.

But this might not hold for all cases.

But perhaps, for a given m_i, if we can find the minimal m_i (even or odd) that satisfies a_i + delta_i >=x, then that's sufficient.

But how to find this m_i for each element.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given x and element i, we can compute the required m_i by binary search over possible m_i values. For each possible m_i, compute delta_i(m_i, k_j) and check if a_i + delta_i >=x. But for k_j up to 1e9, m_i can be up to k_j, which is 1e9. Binary search over m_i for each element and each query may be feasible if the per-check time is O(1), and since q is 1e3 and n is 1e3, 1e3 * 1e3 * 30 (binary search steps) = 3e6 operations.

But how to compute delta_i(m_i, k_j) in O(1) time.

Yes, because the formula for delta_i can be computed with the sum formula for arithmetic sequences.

So the steps for each query k_j would be:

For each query k_j:

1. For each element i:

   a. Binary search the minimal m_i where a_i + delta_i(m_i, k_j) >=x.

But wait, during the binary search for x (the maximum possible minimal value), for each candidate x, we need to compute for each element i the minimal m_i required to reach x. Then sum these m_i's and check if <=k_j.

So the overall approach is:

For each query k_j:

   Binary search on x, where low is the initial minimal a_i (since all elements are red initially, the minimal a_i is the answer for k=0), and high is the maximum possible a_i + delta_i(k_j, k_j). Because if all k_j operations are assigned to one element, its delta is maximized.

But how to compute the high limit.

The maximum possible delta for an element is achieved when it is assigned all k operations. So delta is sum of s=ceil(k/2) largest operations minus sum of t=floor(k/2) largest of the remaining. For example, delta = sum(k -s +1 ...k) - sum(1 ... t). But how to compute that.

But for the binary search, the high can be set as the maximum a_i plus this delta. But since this can be very large, perhaps it's better to use a dynamically computed high.

But during the binary search for each query, the high can be the maximum a_i plus the delta when all k operations are assigned to it.

But for each query, this may vary. So for a query k, the maximum possible x is the maximum a_i plus delta_i(k, k). So this is the highest possible x for that query.

Once the binary search bounds are established, the process is as follows:

For each candidate x in the binary search:

   For each element i:

      Find the minimal m_i such that a_i + delta_i(m_i, k_j) >=x.

      If no such m_i exists (even when m_i =k_j, a_i + delta_i(k_j, k_j) <x), then x is impossible.

   Sum all m_i's. If sum <=k_j, then x is feasible. Else, not.

The maximum x for which this holds is the answer.

Now, the key is how to compute for each element i and x, the minimal m_i required.

To find this m_i, we can binary search for m_i in [0, k_j], and for each possible m_i, compute the delta and check if a_i + delta >=x.

But since the delta for m_i can be computed in O(1), this is feasible.

But since the delta is not monotonic with m_i, this approach may not find the minimal m_i.

For example, suppose there exists a m_i where a_i + delta >=x, then higher m_i may not satisfy this, but even higher ones may. So the binary search approach would not find the minimal m_i.

But in practice, for each element, the minimal m_i is the smallest m where a_i + delta(m) >=x. However, if the function is not monotonic, there may be multiple m_i's where this holds, but the minimal is the first occurrence. But binary search may not find it.

Thus, this approach may not work. So alternative approaches are needed.

Alternative idea: precompute all possible m_i up to some limit and find the minimal m_i.

But for k_j up to 1e9, this is impossible.

Alternative approach: consider that for a given k_j, the delta_i(m_i) is a function that for m_i up to k_j can be computed, but may have varying behavior.

But given that for m_i, the delta increases up to a certain point and then decreases, or vice versa, the function may have a single peak, making it unimodal. In that case, we can use ternary search to find the maximum delta for m_i. But this is only useful if we are trying to find the maximum delta for each element. However, here we are trying to find the minimal m_i such that a_i + delta(m_i) >=x. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function a_i + delta(m_i) is unimodal for each element. If it increases to a certain point and then decreases, then there may be a single maximum, and after that, increasing m_i will decrease the delta. But this isn't necessarily the case.

But even if it is, for a given x, the required m_i may be in a region where the function is increasing. For example, when x is below the maximum possible a_i + delta(m_i) for some m_i, the minimal m_i could be the smallest m_i where the function crosses x.

But if the function is not monotonic, then even this is not guaranteed.

Thus, the problem of finding the minimal m_i for each x is non-trivial.

Another idea: perhaps for each element i and query k_j, we can precompute all possible m_i in a certain range and find the minimal m_i that satisfies the condition. But with k_j up to 1e9, this is impossible.

Alternative approach: find a mathematical formula for the minimal m_i required to achieve a_i + delta(m_i) >=x.

But this seems difficult. Let's see if we can model delta(m) in terms of m.

Given k_j and m, the delta is:

s = ceil(m/2), t = floor(m/2)

sum_high = sum from (k - s +1) to k of i â s*(k + (k -s +1)) / 2 = s*(2k -s +1)/2

sum_low = sum from (k -m +1) to (k -m +t) of i â t*( (k -m +1) + (k -m +t) ) / 2 = t*(2(k -m) + t +1)/2

delta = sum_high - sum_low

But this is a function of m. So:

delta(m) = [s*(2k -s +1) - t*(2(k -m) + t +1)] / 2

But s = ceil(m/2) = (m+1)//2, t = floor(m/2) = m//2.

So substituting:

delta(m) = [ ( (m+1)//2 )*(2k - (m+1)//2 + 1) - (m//2)*(2(k -m) + (m//2) +1) ] / 2

This seems complicated. But perhaps we can express this in terms of m.

Alternatively, considering even and odd m.

Case 1: m is even â m=2p.

s = p, t =p.

delta = [p*(2k -p +1) - p*(2(k-2p) +p +1) ] /2

= p [ (2k -p +1) - (2k -4p +p +1) ] / 2 

= p [ (2k -p +1) - (2k -3p +1) ] /2 

= p [ 2p ] /2 

= p * p = pÂ² = (m/2)Â².

So for even m, delta(m) = (m/2)^2.

Case 2: m is odd â m=2p+1.

s =p+1, t =p.

sum_high = (p+1)*(k - (p+1) +1 +k ) / 2 

= (p+1)*(2k -p ) / 2 

sum_low = p*( (k - (2p+1) +1 ) + (k - (2p+1) + p )) /2 

= p*(k -2p +k -p -1 ) /2 

= p*(2k -3p -1) / 2 

delta = sum_high - sum_low = [ (p+1)(2k -p) - p(2k -3p -1) ] / 2 

Expand:

= [ (2k(p+1) - p(p+1)) - (2k p - 3pÂ² p -p) ) ] /2 

Wait, let's compute the numerator:

(p+1)(2k -p) = 2k(p+1) - p(p+1)

p(2k -3p -1) = 2k p -3pÂ² -p

So numerator = [2k(p+1) -p(p+1) - 2kp +3pÂ² +p ] 

= 2kp +2k -pÂ² -p -2kp +3pÂ² +p 

= 2k + 2pÂ² 

So delta = (2k + 2pÂ² ) / 2 = k + pÂ².

But since m=2p+1, p = (m-1)/2.

So delta = k + ((m-1)/2)^2.

So in this case, for odd m, delta = k + ((m-1)/2)^2.

Wait, that's a big simplification. So:

For even m (m=2p):

delta = pÂ² = (m/2)Â².

For odd m (m=2p+1):

delta = k + pÂ² = k + ((m-1)/2)^2.

This is a huge simplification!

So for each m:

if m is even â delta = (m/2)^2.

if m is odd â delta = ((m-1)/2)^2 +k.

Wow, this makes things much easier.

Now, how did this happen?

Let's verify with the previous examples.

For example, when k=5:

Case m=3 (odd):

p=(3-1)/2=1.

delta=5 +1^2=6. Which matches earlier calculation.

For m=4 (even):

delta=(4/2)^2=4, which matches.

For m=5 (odd):

p=2 â delta=5 +2^2=9, which matches.

For m=2 (even):

delta=(2/2)^2=1, which matches.

So this formula holds.

This is a crucial insight. So the delta for m operations when the element is assigned the m largest operations (from 1 to k) is:

delta(m) = (m//2)^2 + (k if m is odd else 0).

So for even m: delta = (m/2)^2.

For odd m: delta = ( (m-1)/2 )^2 + k.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

For each query k, each element i can be assigned m_i operations (summing to k), and the delta for element i is:

delta_i = (m_i // 2)^2 if m_i even,

delta_i = ((m_i -1) // 2)^2 + k if m_i odd.

The goal is to choose m_i's such that sum(m_i) =k, and the minimal (a_i + delta_i) is maximized.

So now, the problem is to find the maximum x such that there exists a set of m_i's (summing to k) where for each i, a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x.

This is now manageable, as the delta function is now a simple function of m_i.

Now, the binary search approach is feasible.

The steps for each query k are:

1. Binary search for x between low and high. The low can be the initial minimum a_i (when all m_i=0). The high can be the maximum possible x, which is when all k operations are assigned to one element, giving it the maximum possible delta.

For example, if the element is assigned m_i =k (even or odd). For even k, delta is (k/2)^2. For odd k, delta is ((k-1)/2)^2 +k. So the high can be max(a_i) + max( (k//2)^2, ((k-1)//2)^2 +k )

But the high can be set to a very large value, like 1e18, and adjusted during binary search.

2. For a candidate x, compute for each element i the minimal m_i needed such that a_i + delta_i(m_i) >=x. Then sum these m_i's. If the sum is <=k, then x is feasible.

3. The maximum x for which this is possible is the answer.

Now, the key is to compute for each element i and x, the minimal m_i required.

Given the delta function, for each element i:

We need to find the smallest m_i (>=0) such that:

a_i + delta(m_i) >=x.

Where delta(m_i) is:

if m_i is even: (m_i/2)^2.

if m_i is odd: ((m_i-1)/2)^2 +k.

But how to find m_i.

Let's think about this for a given x and a_i.

We can model the problem as finding the minimal m_i such that:

For even m:

a_i + (m/2)^2 >=x.

For odd m:

a_i + ((m-1)/2)^2 +k >=x.

We need to find the minimal m_i such that at least one of these conditions is satisfied.

So for each m, whether even or odd, we can compute the minimal possible m.

Let's define for even m:

even_m satisfies a_i + (m_even//2)^2 >=x.

For odd m:

odd_m satisfies a_i + ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k >=x.

We can compute the minimal m_even and m_odd and then take the minimal between them.

But how to find the minimal m.

For even m:

The minimal even m_even is the smallest even integer such that (m_even/2)^2 >= x -a_i.

Similarly for odd m_odd.

Alternatively, we can find the minimal m that satisfies either even or odd condition.

So let's compute for even m:

We need (m/2)^2 >= (x -a_i).

Let s_even = ceil( sqrt( max(0, x -a_i) ) )

Then m_even is the smallest even integer such that m_even/2 >= s_even.

So m_even = 2*s_even if s_even is an integer, else 2*ceil(s_even).

Wait, wait. Let's compute s = ceil( sqrt(D) ), where D =x -a_i.

If D <=0: then m_even can be 0.

Else, m_even is the minimal even m such that (m/2)^2 >= D. So m_even = 2*ceil( sqrt(D) )

Similarly, for odd m:

We need ((m-1)/2)^2 +k >= D.

Which rearranges to ((m-1)/2)^2 >= D -k.

But D -k can be negative. So if D -k <=0, then any odd m >=1 will satisfy the condition. So the minimal odd m is 1.

Else, ((m-1)/2)^2 >= D -k.

Let t = ceil( sqrt( max(0, D -k) ) )

Then, (m-1)/2 >=t â m >= 2t +1.

The minimal odd m is 2t +1.

But we need to check if 2t +1 is odd and >=1.

So for odd m:

If D -k <=0 â minimal m is 1.

Else, compute t = ceil( sqrt(D -k) ), then m_odd = 2*t +1.

Now, the minimal m_i for the element is the minimal between m_even and m_odd.

But sometimes, even if m_odd is smaller than m_even, it may not satisfy the condition. So we need to compute both and pick the minimal.

So the steps for each element i and x:

Compute D =x -a_i.

If D <=0: m_i=0.

Else:

   Compute possible m_even and m_odd.

   m_even = 2*ceil( sqrt(D) )

   m_odd:

      if (D -k) <=0:

         m_odd =1.

      else:

         t = ceil( sqrt( D -k ) )

         m_odd = 2*t +1.

   Then, compute if m_even and m_odd are valid.

Wait, no. Because the even and odd cases are separate. For even m_even, we compute the minimal even m_even that satisfies (m_even/2)^2 >=D.

For odd m_odd, compute the minimal m_odd that satisfies ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k >=D.

But these conditions must be checked.

So for example:

For even m_even:

if (m_even/2)^2 >=D, then it's valid.

For m_odd:

if ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k >=D, then it's valid.

So for each candidate m_even and m_odd, check if they are valid, and then choose the minimal m_i between them.

But even this can be tricky. For example, m_even may be 4, but m_odd=3 may have a larger delta.

But given that D is fixed, let's proceed.

So for each element i and x:

D =x -a_i.

If D <=0: required m_i is 0.

Else:

   Compute m_even:

      s = ceil( sqrt(D) )

      m_even = 2*s.

      but check if (s-1)^2 >=D. For example, if sqrt(D) is an integer, then s= sqrt(D), and (s-1)^2 is (sqrt(D)-1)^2 which is less than D. So m_even is 2*s.

      Wait, no. For example, D=4, s=2. m_even=4. (4/2)^2=4 >=4.

      For D=5, s=3 (ceil(sqrt(5))=3), m_even=6. (6/2)^2=9 >=5.

      So m_even is the minimal even m where (m/2)^2 >= D.

   Compute m_odd:

      delta_odd = ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k.

      We need delta_odd >= D.

      So ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 >= D -k.

      Let's compute E = D -k.

      If E <=0: then even if ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 is zero (m_odd=1), delta_odd=0 +k >= D â since E <=0 â D <=k â 0 +k >=D â yes. So minimal m_odd=1.

      Else: compute t=ceil(sqrt(E)), then m_odd=2*t +1.

      Check if ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 >= E â t^2 >=E.

      So m_odd=2*t +1.

   Now, after computing m_even and m_odd, compute the actual delta for both.

   For example, m_even could be 2*s, but it's possible that even with m_even, delta_even= (m_even/2)^2 >=D.

   Similarly, m_odd's delta_odd= ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k >=D.

   So for each element, the minimal m_i is the minimal between m_even and m_odd (if both are valid), or whichever is valid.

   But what if both are valid? We need to take the minimal of m_even and m_odd.

   For example, if m_even=4 and m_odd=3, then m_odd is better.

   So for each element, the minimal m_i is the minimum between the possible m_even and m_odd.

But how to handle cases where one of them is not valid.

So, for each element i:

Compute D =x -a_i.

if D <=0: m_i=0.

else:

   compute m_even as 2*ceil(sqrt(D))

   compute m_odd:

      if (D -k) <=0 â m_odd=1.

      else:

         t=ceil( sqrt( D -k ) )

         m_odd= 2*t +1.

   Now, check if a_i + delta(m_even, k) >=x.

   check if a_i + delta(m_odd, k) >=x.

   valid_even = (delta_even >=D) ?

   delta_even for even m is (m_even//2)^2 â which is sÂ² >=D â yes.

   So valid_even is true.

   For m_odd:

      delta_odd is ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 +k.

      if E = D -k <=0:

         delta_odd= ((1-1)/2)^2 +k =0 +k >=D â since D -k <=0 âk >=D â yes.

      else:

         ((m_odd-1)/2)^2 >=E â tÂ² >=E â yes.

         delta_odd= tÂ² +k >=E +k = D â yes.

      So delta_odd >=D â valid_odd is true.

   So both m_even and m_odd are valid.

   So the minimal m_i is min(m_even, m_odd).

But wait, what if m_even is larger than m_odd?

For example, D=5, k=5.

m_even=2*3=6 (since sqrt(5)=~2.236, ceil is 3). delta_even=3^2=9 >=5.

m_odd: E=5-5=0 â m_odd=1. delta_odd=0+5=5 >=5.

So m_odd=1 is better than m_even=6.

So for this case, the minimal m_i is 1.

But how to compute this.

So the minimal m_i is min(m_even, m_odd).

But m_even can be larger or smaller than m_odd.

So for each element, the required m_i is min(m_even, m_odd).

But what if m_odd is not possible? For example, when D -k is very large, but k is small.

But according to the delta_odd formula, when E = D -k is positive, then m_odd is 2*t +1, where t is ceil(sqrt(E)). So delta_odd is tÂ² +k. But if E is larger than tÂ², then it's not possible. But since t=ceil(sqrt(E)), tÂ² >=E.

So delta_odd is tÂ² +k >=E +k = D â yes.

Thus, for any D and k, m_odd and m_even are valid.

Thus, the minimal m_i is min(m_even, m_odd).

So for each element, the required m_i is the minimal between m_even and m_odd.

But what if m_even or m_odd exceeds k_j?

Because in a query k_j, the element can't be assigned more than k_j operations.

So the minimal m_i is the minimal between m_even, m_odd, but also considering that m_i can't exceed k_j. Because even if m_even or m_odd is smaller than k_j, but the sum for all elements may exceed k_j.

Wait, no. The problem allows assigning up to k_j operations. So for a single element, m_i can be up to k_j. But when checking for x, the sum of all m_i's must be <=k_j.

But in the binary search step, for a candidate x, we compute the sum of all m_i's (minimal required for each element) and check if the sum is <=k_j.

If any m_i required is larger than k_j, then even if we assign all k_j operations to that element, it may not reach x. So, for example, if m_even and m_odd are both larger than k_j, then the element's delta is a_i + delta(k_j) (if k_j is even or odd).

Wait, but the required m_i for the element may be larger than k_j, meaning that even assigning all possible operations to this element (k_j operations) won't be enough to reach x. In this case, x is not feasible.

Thus, for each element i:

compute m_even and m_odd as before.

then, m_i_candidate = min(m_even, m_odd).

if m_i_candidate >k_j â then even assigning all k_j operations to this element won't suffice. So check if a_i + delta(k_j) >=x.

If yes â m_i_candidate =k_j.

If no â x is not feasible.

So the process becomes:

For element i:

compute m_even and m_odd.

m_i_candidate = min(m_even, m_odd).

if m_i_candidate >k_j:

   compute delta with m_i=k_j.

   if a_i + delta >=x â m_i =k_j.

   else â x is not feasible for this element.

Else:

   m_i =m_i_candidate.

So, during the binary search for x, for each element i:

We compute the minimal m_i_candidate.

If m_i_candidate >k_j â check if even with k_j operations, the delta is enough.

If not â x is impossible.

Else â sum m_i's, but for this element, m_i is k_j.

So this requires modifying the approach.

But how to handle this.

Thus, for each element i:

   required_m_i = min(m_even, m_odd).

   if required_m_i >k_j:

      compute delta with m_i =k_j.

      if a_i + delta <x â x is impossible.

      else â required_m_i =k_j.

   else:

      required_m_i = min(m_even, m_odd).

So sum all required_m_i's.

If sum <=k_j â x is feasible.

Else â not feasible.

But this approach may require that some elements have their m_i set to k_j (if their required_m_i is larger than k_j, but delta(k_j) >=x).

But since sum of m_i's must be exactly k_j, but the sum of required_m_i's (including possibly some k_j's) may exceed k_j, we need to adjust.

But this complicates the problem.

Alternatively, during the binary search for x, for each element i:

   compute the minimal m_i required to reach x. If this m_i exceeds k_j, then x is not feasible.

But this is not correct, because even if m_i exceeds k_j for one element, other elements may use more operations, allowing this element to use all k_j operations.

But this is a problem, because the sum of all m_i's must be exactly k_j.

So, this approach is not correct.

The binary search approach must consider that the sum of all m_i's must be exactly k_j.

But the binary search is for x such that there exists a way to assign m_i's (summing to exactly k_j) with each a_i + delta_i >=x.

But in our current approach, we compute the minimal m_i's for each element to reach x, sum them, and check if the sum is <=k_j. But this doesn't account for the possibility that some elements can use more than their minimal m_i, allowing others to use less.

But maximizing x requires that all elements meet x, so the minimal sum of m_i's is required. If the sum of the minimal m_i's is <=k_j, then there exists a way to assign the remaining operations (k_j - sum) to other elements to reach x.

Wait, no. Because the minimal m_i's are the minimal required to reach x. Assigning more operations to other elements may allow their a_i + delta_i to increase, but it's not necessary. The goal is to have all elements' a_i + delta_i >=x. So the sum of the minimal m_i's must be <=k_j. If so, then the remaining operations (k_j - sum) can be distributed in any way, possibly increasing some elements' delta_i beyond x. But since x is the minimal, any additional operations would only increase some elements' deltas, which doesn't lower the minimal value.

Thus, the binary search approach remains valid: if the sum of the minimal m_i's is <=k_j, then x is feasible.

But when an element's minimal m_i exceeds k_j, then even assigning all k_j operations to it may not suffice, leading to x being impossible.

Thus, during the binary search, for each element i:

Compute required_m_i as min(m_even, m_odd).

If required_m_i >k_j â check if a_i + delta(k_j) >=x. If not, x is impossible.

If yes â required_m_i =k_j.

But sum all required_m_i's. If sum exceeds k_j â x is impossible.

Else â feasible.

But this is not correct, because if multiple elements require m_i =k_j, their sum would be more than k_j.

For example, two elements may each require m_i =k_j, sum would be 2*k_j, which is impossible.

So, this suggests that the binary search approach needs to account for the sum of required_m_i's.

But how to handle this.

Alternative idea: during the binary search step, for each element i:

Compute the minimal m_i required to reach x. If this m_i exceeds k_j, then x is impossible.

Otherwise, sum all m_i's. If sum <=k_j â feasible.

But this is not correct, because some elements may have m_i's that can be increased (thereby allowing their a_i + delta_i to increase beyond x), allowing other elements to have their m_i's decreased. But since x is the minimal, this is not necessary.

But in this case, if the sum of the minimal m_i's is <=k_j, then x is feasible because the remaining operations can be assigned to any elements (which would not reduce the minimal x).

So the binary search approach is correct as long as:

sum of minimal m_i's required for x is <=k_j.

But when an element's minimal m_i exceeds k_j, then even assigning all k_j operations to that element may not suffice. Thus, for such x to be feasible, the element's delta when assigned all k_j operations must be >=x.

So the steps for each element i and x:

Compute D =x -a_i.

If D <=0 â m_i=0.

Else:

   compute m_even and m_odd.

   required_m_i = min(m_even, m_odd).

   if required_m_i >k_j:

      check if a_i + delta(k_j) >=x.

      if yes â required_m_i =k_j.

      else â x is impossible.

   else:

      required_m_i remains.

Then sum all required_m_i's. If sum <=k_j â x is feasible.

But what if the sum exceeds k_j?

For example, required_m_i's sum to 5, but k_j=3. Then x is not feasible.

But how to handle this.

Thus, during the binary search for x, for each element:

compute required_m_i.

if any element's required_m_i is impossible (even after assigning all k_j operations), then x is impossible.

else, sum all required_m_i's. If sum <=k_j â x is feasible.

else â x is not feasible.

Thus, the binary search approach works.

Now, the problem is how to compute required_m_i for each element and x.

Let's formalize this.

For each element i and x:

D =x -a_i.

if D <=0:

   required_m_i =0.

else:

   compute s = ceil( sqrt(D) )

   m_even = 2*s.

   E =D -k_j.

   if E <=0:

      m_odd =1.

   else:

      t=ceil( sqrt(E) )

      m_odd = 2*t +1.

   required_m_i = min(m_even, m_odd).

   if required_m_i >k_j:

      compute delta_with_k = delta(k_j).

      if a_i + delta_with_k >=x:

         required_m_i =k_j.

      else:

         x is impossible.

   else:

      required_m_i remains.

sum all required_m_i's. If sum <=k_j â feasible.

Else â not feasible.

But how to compute delta_with_k.

delta_with_k is:

if k_j is even â (k_j/2)^2.

if k_j is odd â ((k_j-1)/2)^2 +k_j.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.

But wait, when required_m_i >k_j, we check if a_i + delta(k_j) >=x.

But delta(k_j) is the maximum possible delta for that element when assigned all k_j operations.

So for example, if the element can reach x by using all k_j operations, then required_m_i =k_j.

But then, the sum of all required_m_i's may exceed k_j.

Thus, this approach is not correct.

For example:

n=2, q=1, a=[0,0], k=5.

x=5.

For each element:

D=5-0=5.

m_even =2*3=6 (since sqrt(5) ~2.236, ceil is 3).

m_odd: E=5-5=0 â m_odd=1.

required_m_i =min(6,1) =1.

But required_m_i=1, which is <=5. So each element requires 1, sum is 2 <=5. So x=5 is feasible.

But when each element has m_i=1, the delta for each is 0 + delta(1) =0 + (0 +5) =5. So each element's value is 5. So minimal is 5, which meets x=5.

But the sum is 2, which is <=5. So the code would think it's feasible.

But what if x=10.

For each element:

D=10-0=10.

m_even=2*4=8 (sqrt(10)=3.16 â ceil is4).

m_odd: E=10-5=5. t=3 (sqrt(5)=2.236 â ceil is3). m_odd=2*3+1=7.

required_m_i=7.

But 7>5.

So check if a_i + delta(5) >=10.

delta(5) is odd m=5: ((5-1)/2)^2 +5 â (2)^2 +5=4+5=9.

a_i + delta=0+9=9 <10. So x=10 is impossible.

Thus, the code correctly rejects x=10.

Thus, this approach seems correct.

Now, the code can be written.

But how to implement this in Python.

Now, the steps for each query:

Read k_j.

For each query k_j:

   Precompute delta_with_k for even and odd k_j.

   delta_k = (k_j//2)^2 if even, else ((k_j-1)//2)^2 +k_j.

   Binary search between low and high.

   low = min(a) (since for k=0, all elements are red, so minimal is min(a)).

   high = max( a_i + delta_i_for_k_j(m_i=k_j) )

   For each candidate x in binary search:

      sum_m =0.

      possible =True.

      for each element i in a:

          a_i_val = a[i]

          D =x -a_i_val

          if D <=0:

              sum_m +=0

              continue

          # compute m_even

          s = math.ceil(math.sqrt(D))

          m_even = 2*s

          # compute m_odd

          E = D -k_j

          if E <=0:

              m_odd =1

          else:

              t = math.ceil(math.sqrt(E))

              m_odd = 2*t +1

          required_m = min(m_even, m_odd)

          if required_m >k_j:

              # check if using k_j operations gives delta >=D

              if k_j %2 ==0:

                  delta_k = (k_j//2)**2

              else:

                  delta_k = ((k_j-1)//2)**2 +k_j

              if a_i_val + delta_k >=x:

                  sum_m +=k_j

              else:

                  possible =False

                  break

          else:

              sum_m += required_m

          if sum_m >k_j:

              possible =False

              break

      if possible and sum_m <=k_j:

          # feasible, try higher x

          low =x

      else:

          # not feasible, try lower x

          high =x-1

   After binary search, low is the answer.

But the code needs to handle the binary search correctly.

Now, considering that in the binary search, for each x, we need to check if it's feasible, and adjust low and high accordingly.

The code will look something like this.

But also, note that the binary search may need to handle cases where the sum of required_m_i's exceeds k_j. For example, if the sum is 5 but k_j is 3. But the code checks during the loop if sum_m exceeds k_j and breaks early.

Now, the code.

But there's a possibility of overflow, but Python handles big integers well.

Now, implementing this in Python.

Let's test with the first example:

Sample Input 1:

4 10

5 2 8 4

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Sample Output:

3 4 5 6 7 8 8 10 8 12

Let's take query k=8.

The output is 10.

Let's see what happens during the binary search.

For k=8:

We need to find the maximum x such that the sum of m_i's is 8.

The array a is [5,2,8,4].

For x=10:

For each element:

element 5:

D=10-5=5.

m_even=2*3=6.

m_odd: E=5-8= -3 â m_odd=1.

required_m = min(6,1) =1.

sum_m=1.

element 2:

D=10-2=8.

m_even=2*3=6 (sqrt(8)=2.828, ceil is3).

m_odd: E=8-8=0 â m_odd=1.

required_m=1.

sum_m=1+1=2.

element 8:

D=10-8=2.

m_even=2*2=4.

m_odd: E=2-8= -6 â m_odd=1.

required_m=1.

sum_m=3.

element4:

D=10-4=6.

m_even=2*3=6.

m_odd: E=6-8= -2 â m_odd=1.

required_m=1.

sum_m=4.

sum_m=4 <=8. So x=10 is feasible.

But during binary search, perhaps the maximum x is higher.

But according to the sample output, for k=8, the answer is 10.

But let's see for x=11:

For element 5:

D=6. m_even=2*3=6. m_odd=1. required_m=1. sum=1.

element 2:

D=9. m_even=2*4=8 (sqrt(9)=3, ceil is3 â 2*3=6? No. Wait D=9. sqrt(9)=3, so s=3. m_even=2*3=6. (6/2)^2=9 >=9. sum +=6. sum=7.

element 8: D=3. m_even=2*2=4. m_odd: E=3-8= -5 â m_odd=1. required_m=1. sum=8.

element4: D=7. m_even=2*3=6. m_odd: E=7-8= -1 â m_odd=1. required_m=1. sum=9. Which is >8 â not feasible.

Thus, x=11 is not feasible.

Thus, the maximum x is 10.

So the code would correctly compute it.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the code:

But we need to read n and q, then the array a, then the queries.

For each query k in the list:

   compute the answer via binary search as described.

But for large k (up to 1e9), the code needs to handle the binary search efficiently.

Now, the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import math


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, q = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    queries = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    for k in queries:

        # Handle k=0 case

        if k ==0:

            print(min(a), end=' ', file=output_stream)

            continue

        low = min(a)

        # Compute high: maximum a_i + delta when assigned all k operations.

        max_delta_even = (k//2)**2

        max_delta_odd = ((k-1)//2)**2 + k

        max_delta = max(max_delta_even, max_delta_odd)

        high = max(a) + max_delta

        best = 0

        while low <= high:

            mid = (low + high) //2

            sum_m =0

            possible =True

            for ai in a:

                D = mid - ai

                if D <=0:

                    continue

                # compute m_even

                s = math.ceil(math.sqrt(D))

                m_even = 2*s

                # compute m_odd

                E = D -k

                if E <=0:

                    m_odd =1
