Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the main goal is to compute the maximum possible protection for each k from 0 to n(n-1)/2, where k is the maximum number of orders allowed. Each order allows a shielded lemming to pass their shield to an adjacent neighbor (left or right) if that neighbor doesn't have a shield. Then, we need to calculate the number of protected pairs of lemmings. A protected pair is two unshielded lemmings with at least one shielded lemming between them.

First, I need to model how the shields can be moved and what configuration of shields maximizes the protected pairs for each possible k. The challenge is to efficiently compute the maximum possible protection for all k values up to the maximum possible (which is up to 80*79/2 = 3160 steps? Wait, n is up to 80, so n(n-1)/2 is 80*79/2=3160. So the output has 3160+1 numbers, which is 3161 elements. That's a lot, but perhaps manageable with dynamic programming.

But how to model the state transitions for moving shields. Let's think about the initial positions of shields. Each shield can be moved left or right, but each movement takes a certain number of steps, and each step can be part of the allowed k.

The protected pairs depend on the arrangement of shields. So, for a given shield configuration, the number of protected pairs is the sum over all pairs of unshielded lemmings (i,j) where i < j, and there's at least one shielded lemming between i and j.

But calculating this for each possible configuration after moving shields is tricky. How can we model this optimally?

Alternative approach: think of the problem as arranging the shields in certain positions (each movement takes some steps) such that the protected pairs are maximized, and track the minimal number of steps required to reach each possible arrangement.

Wait, but since we need the maximum protection for each k, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the positions of the shields and the steps taken, but with n up to 80, the number of possible shield positions could be huge. So that's not feasible.

Wait, but the initial shields are given. Each shield can be moved left or right, but the order in which they are moved affects the steps. But perhaps the optimal way to arrange shields is to spread them as much as possible, so that the intervals between shields are as large as possible, thus covering more pairs.

Wait, the protected pairs are those pairs of 0s (unshielded) that have at least one 1 (shield) between them. So the problem reduces to maximizing the number of such pairs.

Let me think: the maximum possible protection is achieved when the shields are arranged in such a way that the unshielded lemmings are divided into segments that are as small as possible. Because each segment of m unshielded lemmings contributes m*(m-1)/2 pairs that are NOT protected. So the total possible pairs is the sum of all such segments. Then, the maximum protected pairs is the total possible pairs of 0s minus this sum.

Wait, right. Let's see:

Total possible pairs of 0s is C(z,2), where z is the number of 0s.

But the protected pairs are the ones where between the two 0s there's at least one 1. So the number of unprotected pairs is the sum over each consecutive sequence of 0s (without any 1s in between) of C(m,2), where m is the length of that sequence. So the protected pairs are total_0_pairs - sum (m_i choose 2) for each consecutive 0s group.

So the problem reduces to arranging the shields (after moving them) such that the sum of (m_i choose 2) is minimized. Therefore, maximizing the protected pairs.

So the key is to find, for each possible k, the minimal sum of (m_i choose 2) that can be achieved with at most k moves, and subtract that from the total_0_pairs.

So the total_0_pairs is fixed once the number of 0s is known. Therefore, the problem becomes, given the initial shield positions, how to move the shields (via moving them left/right) in a way that splits the 0s into as many small segments as possible, and compute for each k the minimal sum of squares (well, sum of m_i choose 2) possible with up to k steps.

So the problem is transformed into finding the minimal sum of (m_i choose 2) over all possible shield configurations achievable with up to k steps, for each k from 0 to max_steps (which could be up to n(n-1)/2).

This seems like the right approach. Now, how to model this.

First, let's compute the initial arrangement's sum of C(m_i, 2). Then, the problem is to find, for each k, the minimal possible sum achievable with up to k steps.

So the steps allowed are moving shields left or right, each movement costs 1 step. But when you move a shield, the movement can only be done if the target position is unshielded. So each movement of a shield to the left or right is possible as long as the adjacent cell is empty. Also, moving a shield can create space for another movement. For example, moving a shield to the right allows the next movement to the right again.

But how to model the possible positions of the shields. Let's think of the shields as objects that can be moved left or right, expanding their positions. However, overlapping is not allowed.

An alternative approach is to model each shield's possible movement as a range. For example, each shield can be in a certain position, and the movement steps correspond to how far each shield has been moved from its original position, considering possible interactions with other shields.

But the problem is that moving one shield affects the possible movements of others. For example, if two shields are next to each other, moving one to the right may block the other's movement.

This seems complicated. So perhaps a dynamic programming approach where we track the positions of each shield is not feasible for n up to 80, as the state space would be too big.

Alternative idea: Let's model the problem as a graph where each node represents a possible configuration of shields (positions), and edges represent moving a shield once (left or right) with a cost of 1. Then, for each node (configuration), the sum is known, and we can track the minimal steps to reach each possible sum. But even for n=80, the number of possible configurations is astronomical. So this is not feasible.

So another approach is needed. Let's consider the shields as separating the 0s into segments. Moving a shield can split a segment into smaller ones, thus reducing the sum.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way to arrange the shields is to spread them as much as possible. For example, if we have m shields, they can split the 0s into m+1 segments. But the initial arrangement may have shields that are adjacent, so moving them can create more segments.

Wait, no. Wait, the shields are initially placed in some positions. The 0s are in the positions where a_i is 0. So when you move a shield, it's possible to create new gaps. But the movement of shields can affect the way the 0s are divided into segments.

But perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when the shields are as spread out as possible. For example, if there are m shields, then the maximum number of segments is m+1. Each shield can separate a segment of 0s. So the sum would be sum of C(k_i, 2) for each segment of k_i 0s in each of the m+1 segments.

To minimize the sum, each k_i should be as small as possible. So the optimal arrangement is to distribute the 0s into as many segments as possible, each with as equal as possible lengths.

But how to model this with the movement steps.

Alternatively, let's think of each shield's movement as contributing to splitting the 0s into more segments. Each movement of a shield to the left or right can create a new segment.

But the problem is that the movement of shields is constrained by their original positions and the movement steps required.

Hmm. Let's think of the initial positions of the shields. Let's say the shields are at positions s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (sorted in increasing order). Then, moving these shields can create new positions. The movement of each shield can be to the left or right, but each movement step costs 1.

Each shield can potentially move to the left or right, but they can't overlap. For example, if two shields are at positions 3 and 5, and the left one moves right once (to 4) and the right one moves left once (to 4), they can't both be there. So the order in which they are moved matters.

But modeling this seems complicated. Let's think of the shields as being able to move to certain positions, and the cost is the number of steps required to reach that arrangement.

Alternatively, for each shield, we can precompute all possible positions it can reach, along with the cost (number of steps required) to get there. Then, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the positions of all shields, ensuring they are in a sorted order and not overlapping.

But even then, for m shields (where m can be up to n), the state space would be too large.

Wait, but n is up to 80. However, even m=40, each shield can have up to 80 possible positions. So the state space for 40 shields would be 80^40, which is impossible.

So, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each shield, the movement to left or right can be considered as expanding the shield's possible range. But perhaps the optimal way to split the 0s into segments is to spread the shields as far as possible, and the cost is the sum of the steps required to move each shield into their optimal positions.

But how to model this.

Another approach: Let's model the problem as moving the shields into positions that split the 0s into as many segments as possible, and compute for each possible way of splitting the 0s into segments, the minimal cost (steps) required. Then, for each possible cost, track the minimal sum of C(k_i, 2).

But again, the number of possible splits could be very large.

Wait, but perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents the current positions of the shields, and each edge is a movement step. But again, the state space is too big.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem's small n (up to 80). Maybe precompute all possible shield positions after moving them, and for each possible arrangement, compute the cost (steps) and the sum of C(k_i, 2). Then, for each possible cost, track the minimal sum. But even for n=80, the possible arrangements are 2^80, which is impossible.

Hmm. So perhaps we need a different approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of the initial and final positions of the shields.

Each shield can move left or right. Let's denote the initial positions of the shields as s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (sorted). Let their final positions be t_1, t_2, ..., t_m (sorted). Each t_i must be >= t_{i-1} + 1 (since shields can't be in the same position). The cost is the sum of |t_i - s_i| for all i, but this is not necessarily the case. Because when shields are moved, they may block each other. For example, a shield moving to the right might require another shield to move more steps. So the actual steps required depend on the order of movements.

Wait, but perhaps the minimal steps required to reach a certain final arrangement is the sum of the individual movements of each shield, assuming that shields are moved in a way that they don't interfere with each other. For example, if two shields are moving left and right in such a way that their paths don't cross, then the minimal steps would be the sum of their individual steps. But if their paths cross, then perhaps the steps required are more.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps to arrange the shields into positions t_1 <= t_2 <= ... <= t_m (each t_i >= t_{i-1}+1) is the sum over |t_i - s_i'|, where s_i' is the initial position adjusted for possible overlaps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the final positions. Suppose that in the final arrangement, the shields are placed at positions t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m (since they can't be in the same spot). Then, the minimal number of steps required to reach this arrangement from the initial positions is the sum of |t_i - s_i| for each i. However, this is only possible if the movement of shields can be done in a way that allows each to reach their target position without conflicting. For example, if the initial positions are s_1=3, s_2=5, and we want to move s_1 to 5 and s_2 to 3, then the sum of |5-3| + |3-5| = 4 steps, but the actual movement would require s_1 moves right two steps, and s_2 moves left two steps, but during this movement, they can't swap positions directly. So the actual steps required would be 4, but in reality, they can't cross each other. So this arrangement is impossible.

Therefore, the minimal steps to reach a certain arrangement may not be the sum of individual distances unless the movement can be done in a way that allows the shields to pass each other, which they can't.

So, this complicates things. Therefore, the minimal steps required to reach a certain sorted arrangement of shields t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m would be the sum of (t_i - s_i') where s_i' is the original position after considering any necessary shifts due to other shields.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be determined by the sorted order of the initial positions. Let's think: after any number of moves, the order of shields (their relative positions) can't change. Because moving a shield to the left or right can't make it pass another shield. For example, if two shields are initially at positions 3 and 5, the first can move right and the second left, but they can't cross each other. Because to move the first to 4, the second can't move to 4. So the order remains the same. So the final positions must have the same order as the initial shields. Therefore, the relative order of the shields is preserved. So, for the initial shields s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m, the final positions t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m must also satisfy t_i >= t_{i-1} + 1 (so they are in order and not overlapping).

Thus, the minimal steps required for a certain arrangement is the sum of the individual movements of each shield, but ensuring that the movement of each shield does not cause overlaps. So for each shield i, the movement is to t_i, but considering the positions of the previous shields.

Wait, perhaps the minimal steps for arranging the shields into positions t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m (with t_i >= t_{i-1}+1) is the sum over (t_i - s_i') where s_i' is the initial position of the i-th shield. But how to compute s_i'?

Alternatively, the minimal steps can be found by considering the movement of each shield left or right, taking into account the movement of the previous shield.

For example, the first shield can be moved to any position t_1 <= s_1 + x (for x steps to the right) or t_1 >= s_1 - x (to the left). But the second shield must be at least t_1 + 1. So, for each shield, the minimal steps would involve ensuring that each t_i is at least the previous t_{i-1} +1. So the problem becomes similar to arranging intervals with minimal movement.

This is similar to a problem where you have to adjust positions of elements in a sorted array such that each is at least a certain distance apart, and find the minimal total movement. This is a classic problem, and the solution is to greedily adjust each element's position based on the previous one.

For example, starting from the first shield, we can compute the minimal possible t_1 as max(s_1 - x, ... ), then for the next shield, t_2 is the maximum between s_2 and t_1 + 1, and so on.

Wait, but in our case, we can choose any positions for the shields as long as they are in order and non-overlapping. The goal is to find the positions that require the least steps (sum of |t_i - s_i|) and then compute the sum of steps required. But how to model this.

Alternatively, to find the minimal steps for a certain arrangement of shields, we can greedily adjust each shield's position based on the previous shield's position to avoid overlaps. For example:

- Start with the first shield. Its minimal possible position is s_1 - k (for k steps left), but after movement, it's t_1 = s_1 - steps_moved_left + steps_moved_right. But perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, the problem is that each shield can be moved left or right any number of times, but each movement step costs 1. So the total steps for a shield moving from s_i to t_i is |t_i - s_i|. But when arranging the shields, their positions must be t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m, and each t_i >= t_{i-1} + 1.

Therefore, the minimal steps required to arrange the shields into a non-overlapping sequence (in order) is sum_{i=1 to m} (t_i - s_i'), where s_i' is the original s_i adjusted for the constraints from the previous shields.

For example, for the i-th shield:

t_i must be >= t_{i-1} + 1.

But if s_i is less than t_{i-1} +1, then t_i has to be at least t_{i-1}+1, which may require moving it to the right. The steps added would be (t_i - s_i).

So the process would be:

t_1 can be any position, but the steps for the first shield is |t_1 - s_1|.

For the second shield, t_2 must be >= t_1 +1. So the minimal possible t_2 is max(s_2, t_1 +1). But if we want to minimize steps, we can set t_2 to max(s_2, t_1 +1). Because if s_2 is already >= t_1 +1, then no steps needed. Otherwise, we have to move it to t_1 +1. But steps would be (t_1 +1 - s_2).

But wait, maybe moving the first shield to a position that allows the second shield to have a smaller step. For example, if s_1 is 5, s_2 is 6. Then, moving the first shield to 4 would allow the second to stay at 6 (since 6 >=4+1). The steps for the first would be 1 (5-4), and the second is 0.

Alternatively, if we have s_1=3, s_2=5. Then, for the second shield, if we set t_1=3, then t_2 must be at least 4. So steps for t_2 would be 5->4, which is -1, which is not possible. Wait, no. If s_2 is 5, and t_2 must be at least 4 (t_1=3), then 5 can't be moved left to 4. So steps would be 4-5= -1, but absolute value is 1. So steps for second shield is 1.

So in this case, total steps is (3-3) + (4-5) steps. So total steps is 1.

But what if we could arrange t_1=4 and t_2=5. Then steps for first shield is 1 (3->4), second is 0. Total steps 1. So same as before.

So the minimal steps in this case is 1.

This suggests that the minimal steps required to arrange the shields in non-overlapping positions can be computed by greedily setting each t_i to the maximum between s_i and (t_{i-1} + 1). Because moving a shield left can't help in this case. But perhaps there are scenarios where moving a shield left allows others to have smaller steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is achieved by moving each shield as little as possible, considering the constraints from the previous shields.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize t_1 = s_1.

For i from 2 to m:

t_i = max(s_i, t_{i-1} + 1)

steps += (t_i - s_i)

But this is assuming that the shields are moved to the right as needed. But maybe moving some shields to the left could result in a lower total steps.

Hmm. Let's take an example:

Initial positions are s_1=5, s_2=6.

If we set t_1=5, t_2 must be 6, so steps are 0. Which is correct.

Another example: s_1=3, s_2=4.

If we set t_1=3, t_2 must be 4. Steps 0.

But if s_1=3, s_2=3 (which is impossible, since shields can't be at the same position initially). Wait, initial positions are given with a_i=1. So the initial positions are unique and sorted.

So, for a valid initial arrangement, the shields are in strictly increasing positions.

So the initial s_i are sorted as s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m.

In this case, for the i-th shield, s_i >= s_{i-1}+1. Because initially, the shields are placed on distinct positions.

So in the initial arrangement, the shields are non-overlapping.

But when moving, the shields can be moved into overlapping positions. Wait no. Because each movement requires the target position to be unshielded. So, for example, if a shield is at position 3, and you move it to the right to position 4 (if position 4 is unshielded), then in the new configuration, shields are at 4. So during the movement process, each step moves a shield to an unoccupied adjacent position.

But the problem allows for the shields to be moved multiple times, possibly passing other shields. But no, because when a shield is moved left or right, it's to an adjacent position. For example, two shields at positions 3 and 5: the first can move right to 4 (but only if the adjacent position is unshielded. Wait, in this case, position 4 is initially unshielded. So moving the first shield from 3 to 4 is allowed. Then, the second shield can move left to 4, but that position is now occupied. So that's not allowed. So shields can't swap positions by moving into each other's previous spots.

So, after moving the first shield to 4, the second shield can't move to 4. So shields can't cross each other. Therefore, the relative order of shields remains the same. So the final positions of the shields must be in the same order as the initial positions.

Thus, the shields' final positions must be in the order t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m, and each t_i >= s_i - x, where x is steps to the left. But the movement of each shield is constrained by the previous shield's position.

So the minimal steps required to reach a certain configuration can be computed by greedily moving each shield as far left as possible, but ensuring that each t_i is at least t_{i-1} + 1.

Alternatively, we can model this as follows: the minimal steps to arrange the shields in positions t_1, t_2, ..., t_m (sorted) is sum_{i=1 to m} |t_i - s_i|, with the constraints that t_i >= t_{i-1} + 1 for all i>1, and t_1 >= 1 (assuming positions start at 1).

But how to find all possible t_i sequences and their corresponding steps.

But this seems like the same problem as adjusting the positions of elements in an array such that they are in strictly increasing order and each element is >= previous +1. The minimal steps required to do so.

This is a classic problem. The standard approach is to adjust each element based on the previous one. For example:

t_1 can be any position. For t_2, the minimal position is max(s_2, t_1 +1). This way, the steps for t_2 is max(s_2, t_1 +1) - s_2. So the total steps are accumulated. However, choosing t_1 can affect the total steps. So how to choose t_1 to minimize the sum.

But since the shields are processed in order, and each depends on the previous, the minimal steps can be found by greedily adjusting each shield's position to the minimal possible, given the previous shield's position.

Wait, but this may not be the minimal possible. For example, maybe moving a shield further to the left allows the next shields to have lower steps. But since the previous shields have to be adjusted first, this seems like a dynamic programming problem.

Alternatively, the optimal way is to set each t_i to the maximum between s_i and t_{i-1} + 1. This ensures that each shield is moved as little as possible to the right, given the previous shield's position. But this might not be the minimal total steps.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose m=2, s_1=3, s_2=5.

If we set t_1=3, then t_2 must be >=4. So t_2 is 5 (since s_2=5 >=4). Steps: 0 + 0 =0. So total steps 0.

Another possibility: set t_1=2. Then t_2 can be 3. Steps: (3-2)=1 for the first shield, and (3-5)= -2 (steps is 2). Total steps 3. Which is worse.

So the minimal steps are indeed 0.

Another example: s_1=2, s_2=4.

If t_1=2, t_2=4: steps 0.

But suppose s_1=2, s_2=3. Then, initial positions are s_1=2, s_2=3 (since initially, the shields are at distinct positions, but this is impossible. Wait, no. If the input is such that two shields are adjacent, like [1,1], then the initial arrangement has shields at positions 1 and 2 (assuming zero-based or one-based? The problem says the input is a_i for i from 1 to n, each 0 or 1. So the input could have consecutive 1s.

Ah, so the initial shields can be adjacent. For example, the input could be [1,1,0], which would have shields at positions 1 and 2 (assuming 1-based).

In this case, the initial shields are at positions 1 and 2. To move them into non-overlapping positions (i.e., t_1 and t_2 such that t_2 >= t_1 +1), we need to move at least one of them.

For example, moving the first shield left (if possible) or the second shield right.

So for the example s_1=1, s_2=2.

Possible options:

t_1=0 (if possible), t_2=2: steps (0-1) is 1 step (left move). But the second shield is at 2. t_2 >=0+1=1. So it's allowed. Steps: 1 (for first shield) + 0 (second) =1.

Or, move the second shield right once: steps 0 (first) +1 (second) =1.

Or, move both: t_1=1, t_2=3: steps 0 +1=1.

So minimal steps is 1.

So in this case, the minimal steps is achieved by moving either the first left once, or the second right once.

So the problem of minimal steps is not unique, but the sum can be the same.

But in terms of the problem's constraints, any movement that leads to the desired configuration with minimal steps is acceptable.

So back to the original problem: we need to find the possible arrangements of shields (in non-overlapping positions, same order as initial) and compute for each arrangement the steps required and the sum of C(k_i,2). Then, for each possible step count up to the maximum, track the minimal sum of C(k_i,2), and then compute the maximum possible protection as total_0_pairs - sum.

The question is how to efficiently generate all possible valid arrangements and compute their steps and sum.

But for n up to 80, and m up to 80, this seems challenging.

Alternative approach: For each possible number of steps (k), find the minimal sum of C(k_i,2) achievable with at most k steps.

But how?

The sum of C(k_i, 2) is minimized when the 0s are divided into as many segments as possible, each as small as possible. So the optimal arrangement is to have the shields spread out as much as possible, given the steps allowed.

But how to model this.

Perhaps for each shield, we can model the possible positions it can occupy, and for each possible configuration of shields, compute the steps and sum.

But this is not feasible due to the state space.

Alternative idea inspired by dynamic programming:

Let's model the problem as a dynamic programming where the state is the current shield positions (or some compact representation) and the steps taken so far. For each state, we track the minimal sum of C(k_i,2) achieved. Then, for each possible step count, we keep the best possible sum.

But even with n=80, this seems impossible.

Alternative idea inspired by the problem's note that shields are moved to split 0s into smaller segments. Each movement of a shield can split a segment of 0s into two parts. For example, moving a shield from position x to x+1 can split a segment of 0s into two parts if there are 0s on both sides.

But how to model the cost (steps) and the benefit (reduction in sum of C(k_i,2)).

Perhaps each movement of a shield can be considered as a way to split a segment of 0s into two, which reduces the sum by (a^2 - (b^2 + c^2)), where a is the original length, and b and c are the new lengths (a = b + c + 1? Not sure).

But this requires modeling the segments of 0s and the possible ways to split them by moving shields.

But how?

Let's think of the 0s as being divided into segments by the initial shields. Each movement of a shield allows us to split one of these segments into two, thus reducing the sum of C(m_i, 2).

For example, a segment of length m contributes m*(m-1)/2 to the sum. If we split it into two segments of lengths a and b (a + b +1 = m?), then the new contribution is a*(a-1)/2 + b*(b-1)/2. The difference is the reduction in sum.

The maximum possible reduction is achieved by splitting the largest possible segment into two as equally as possible.

So the problem reduces to greedily making as many splits as possible, each time splitting the largest segment, and keeping track of the cost (steps) required for each split.

But how does moving a shield allow for splitting a segment?

Let's imagine that between two shields (or the ends), there's a segment of 0s. For example, if we have two shields at positions x and y (x < y), the segment of 0s between them is from x+1 to y-1. The length is (y - x -1) zeros.

To split this segment, we can move one of the shields (x or y) into the segment. For example, moving x to the right by k steps would split the segment into two parts: from x+1 to x+k (which are now zeros, but x+k+1 becomes a shield). Similarly for moving y to the left.

Each such movement allows us to split a segment into two, but the cost is the number of steps taken to move the shield into the segment.

The optimal strategy is to split the largest existing segments first, as each split reduces the sum of C(m_i,2) by the maximum possible amount.

Thus, the problem becomes a priority queue problem where we track the current segments, and for each possible split, we compute the cost (steps) and the benefit (reduction in sum). For each possible k steps, we can perform up to k steps' worth of splits, selecting the splits with the best benefit per step.

But how to model this.

For example, suppose we have a segment of length L. The maximum possible reduction is when we split it into two segments. The cost (steps) depends on how many steps it takes to move a shield into this segment.

But the shields are part of the initial configuration. Let's think of the initial shields as separating the 0s into certain segments. For each segment, the number of steps required to split it by moving a shield into it depends on which shield is moved and how far.

Alternatively, each segment can be split by moving the left shield to the right, or the right shield to the left. For example, a segment between shields at x and y has length L = y -x -1. To split this segment, we can move x to the right by a certain number of steps (cost a) or move y to the left by a certain number of steps (cost b). The minimal cost between a and b is chosen to split the segment.

Each time we split a segment into two parts, the benefit is the reduction in sum, which is L*(L-1)/2 - (a*(a-1)/2 + b*(b-1)/2), where a + b + 1 = L.

The maximal benefit is achieved when a and b are as close as possible. For example, splitting a segment of L into two parts of floor((L-1)/2) and ceil((L-1)/2), which gives the maximal possible reduction.

So the problem is to model each possible split and track the cost (steps) and benefit (sum reduction) for each.

But how to model this for all possible splits and track the maximum possible sum reduction for each possible k.

This seems similar to the problem where each split is an operation that can be done, and each split has a certain cost (steps) and a certain gain (sum reduction). The goal is to select a subset of these operations with total cost <=k, such that the total gain is maximized (since the total sum is initial_sum - total_gain).

Thus, the problem reduces to a knapsack-like problem, where items are the possible splits, each with a cost (steps) and gain (reduction in sum). The maximum gain for each k is needed.

But how to model the splits.

But there's a problem: each split of a segment can enable further splits. For example, splitting a segment into two parts allows each of those parts to be split further. So the splits are not independent; each split may create new possible splits.

This complicates things. So the approach of using a priority queue (max-heap) to select the best possible split at each step, and then adding new possible splits created by the current split, is a greedy approach. This is similar to Huffman coding, where each step takes the best current option.

But the issue is that the greedy approach might not be optimal. For example, splitting a large segment may cost a lot of steps, but allow multiple smaller splits later, which could have a higher benefit per step.

But given time constraints, perhaps the greedy approach is the way to go.

So the steps would be:

1. Compute the initial segments of 0s.

2. For each segment, compute the possible ways to split it (moving left or right shield into the segment) and calculate the cost (steps) and the gain (sum reduction).

3. Use a priority queue to select the split with the highest gain per step (or highest gain for the cost).

4. For each split taken, add the new segments created to the list and compute their possible splits.

5. Keep track of the accumulated steps and the total gain. For each possible k up to max_steps, record the maximum total gain possible with at most k steps.

But how to model the steps and gains for all possible k.

This approach is similar to the "best-first" approach, and the steps are processed in order of their efficiency (gain per step). But since each split can generate new possible splits, we need to track all possible splits and their associated costs and gains.

The problem is that the number of possible splits can be very large, especially for n=80. However, given that the maximum steps allowed is up to 3160, and the steps per split can vary, this might be manageable.

But how to compute the maximum gain for each possible k.

The standard approach for this type of problem is to use a dynamic programming array, where dp[k] is the maximum gain achievable with exactly k steps. Then, for each possible split with cost c and gain g, we update dp[k + c] = max(dp[k + c], dp[k] + g) for all k >=0.

However, the splits can be added multiple times (since each split creates new segments that can be split again), so this is similar to an unbounded knapsack problem, but with items that depend on previous choices. Therefore, this approach might not work directly.

Alternative approach: use a priority queue to track the best possible splits (those that give the maximum gain per step), and process them in order. For each split, we track the cost and gain, and accumulate the steps and gains. Then, for each possible step count up to the maximum, we can track the best possible gain up to that step.

But this is not straightforward, as each split can be processed multiple times (e.g., splitting a segment into two, then splitting one of the new segments, etc.).

But perhaps this approach can be modeled as a priority queue where each element is a possible split operation, and each time a split is processed, new split operations are added to the queue.

But how to track the cumulative steps and gains up to each possible k.

Alternatively, we can model this as a way to generate all possible splits, ordered by their efficiency (gain per step), and select splits in that order, accumulating the steps and gains. Then, for each k, the maximum gain is the sum of all splits selected with total steps <=k.

This is the greedy approach, but it may not always yield the optimal solution. For example, a split with a slightly lower gain per step but allowing more splits in the future may be better overall.

However, given time constraints and the problem's size (n=80, steps up to 3160), perhaps the greedy approach is the way to go. Let's explore this.

Each time we have a segment, we can compute the best way to split it (i.e., the split that gives the maximum gain for the least cost). For each segment, the best split is to split it into two as evenly as possible, using the minimal steps required.

For example, consider a segment between shields at x and y (length L = y -x -1). To split this segment, we can move the left shield (x) to the right by steps a, or move the right shield (y) to the left by steps b. Which option gives the maximum gain per step?

The minimal steps to split the segment into two is 1 (either move x right by 1 step, creating a new shield at x+1, which splits the segment into lengths 0 and L-1, or move y left by 1 step, creating a new shield at y-1, which splits into lengths L-1 and 0). But the gain here is (L*(L-1)/2) - (0 + (L-1)*(L-2)/2) ) = (L^2 - L)/2 - (L^2 -3L +2)/2 = (2L -2)/2 = L-1. So the gain is L-1 for 1 step. That's a gain per step of L-1.

But if we split the segment into two equal parts, that would require moving the shield by (L-1)/2 steps. For example, if L is even, moving the left shield by L/2 steps to split into two segments of L/2 -1 and L/2 -1. The gain is (L(L-1)/2) - 2 * (( (L/2-1) (L/2-2) ) /2 ) ). For example, L=4: original sum is 4*3/2=6. After split into two 1's (each of length 1?), sum is 0 + 0 =0. Gain is 6. Steps taken is 2. Gain per step is 3.

Compare with splitting with 1 step: gain is 3, steps 1. Gain per step 3. So in this case, splitting with 1 step is better.

Hmm. So the initial split (moving a shield one step) gives a higher gain per step than splitting deeper into the segment.

So perhaps the optimal way is to always split each segment as much as possible with the least steps, generating the maximum gain per step.

Thus, the greedy approach of always choosing the split with the highest possible gain per step would yield the optimal solution.

Therefore, the steps for the algorithm would be:

1. Compute the initial segments of 0s, determined by the initial positions of the shields.

2. For each segment, calculate the possible splits (either by moving the left shield or the right shield into the segment), each split's cost (steps) and gain (reduction in sum).

3. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to select the split with the highest gain per step.

4. Once a split is selected, add the new segments generated to the list of segments, and compute their possible splits.

5. Track the total steps and the total gain. For each step count up to the maximum possible, keep track of the maximum gain achieved.

6. After processing all possible splits up to the maximum steps, compute the protected pairs as total_0_pairs - (initial_sum - total_gain).

But how to model this.

Let's break this down.

First, compute the initial segments of 0s. For example, if the shields are at positions s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (sorted), then the segments are:

- From position 1 to s_1-1 (if s_1 >1)

- Between s_i and s_{i+1} for each i: s_i+1 to s_{i+1}-1

- From s_m+1 to n (if s_m <n)

Each of these segments has a length of 0s. For each segment, compute its contribution to the sum (sum += len * (len-1) // 2).

Then, the initial sum is this value. The total_0_pairs is (total_0 * (total_0 -1)) // 2, where total_0 is the number of 0s.

So the initial protection is total_0_pairs - initial_sum.

But to compute the maximum possible protection for each k, we need to find the minimal possible sum after using up to k steps.

Now, for each segment in the initial segments, we can compute the possible splits. For example, a segment of length L between shields x and y.

To split this segment, we can move the left shield (x) to the right by 1 step (cost 1), creating a new shield at x+1. This splits the segment into two segments: left part length 0 (since x+1 is the new shield), and the right part length (y - (x+1) -1) = y -x -2.

The gain is L*(L-1)/2 - (0 + (y-x-2)(y-x-3)/2).

Which simplifies to (L(L-1) - (y-x-2)(y-x-3)) / 2.

But since L = y -x -1, substituting:

(y -x -1)(y -x -2)/2 - ( (y-x-2)(y-x-3) )/2 ) = ( (y-x-2) ( (y-x-1) - (y-x-3) )) ) / 2

= (y-x-2)(2) / 2 = y-x-2 = L-1.

So the gain is L-1.

Similarly, moving the right shield (y) to the left by 1 step also gives a gain of L-1, cost 1.

So for a segment of length L, the best possible initial split is cost 1, gain L-1.

After that, the remaining segment is of length L-2. If we split again, cost 1, gain (L-2-1) = L-3.

And so on.

Each time we split a segment by moving a shield one step into it, we gain (current_L -1) and cost 1 step. The remaining segment is current_L -2, allowing for another split.

For example, for a segment of length 5:

First split: cost 1, gain 4. new segments length 0 and 3.

Second split (on the 3-length segment): cost 1, gain 2. new segments length 0 and 1.

Third split (on the 1-length segment): cost 1, gain 0. (since 1-1=0, but the gain is 0). So this split is not useful.

Thus, for a segment of length L, the maximum number of splits possible is floor((L-1)/2). Each split costs 1 step and gives a gain of (L-1) - 2*(i-1), where i is the split number.

For example, L=5:

Split 1: gain 4, cost 1.

Split 2: gain 2, cost 1.

Split 3: gain 0, cost 1. Not useful.

Thus, the maximum splits is 2, with total gain 6, cost 2.

So for a segment of length L, the possible gains and costs are:

Each split after i steps (up to floor((L-1)/2)) gives a cumulative gain of sum_{k=0}^{i-1} (L-1 - 2k) ) = i*(L-1) - 2*(i(i-1)/2) ) = i*(L-1) - i(i-1) ) = i(L-1 - i +1) = i(L -i).

The cost is i steps.

Thus, for a segment of length L, the possible (cost, gain) pairs are (i, i*(L - i)) for i from 1 to floor((L-1)/2).

So for example, L=5:

i=1: cost 1, gain 4 → 1*(5-1) =4.

i=2: cost 2, gain 2*(5-2) =6.

i=3: exceeds floor((5-1)/2)=2.

So for a segment of length L, the possible splits are multiple steps of moving shields into the segment, each time splitting it further.

But in this case, each step of moving a shield further into the segment (cost 1 step) gives an additional gain of (L-1 - 2*(i-1)), where i is the step number.

Thus, the total gain for splitting a segment into i steps is i*(L -i).

So for each segment, the possible splits are a series of options: each i steps (cost i) gives a gain of i*(L -i).

We need to choose which splits to perform to maximize the gain for a given cost.

But how to model this.

This is now similar to the knapsack problem where each segment provides multiple items (possible splits) with varying cost and gain, and we can choose to split a segment multiple times (up to floor((L-1)/2) times).

But the splits for a segment are dependent: for example, to split a segment into i steps, you must have already split it into i-1 steps. But this isn't the case. Each split of i steps is independent of the previous splits. For example, splitting a segment into 2 steps (cost 2, gain 2*(L-2)) is equivalent to doing two 1-step splits (cost 1+1=2, gain (L-1)+(L-3) = 2L-4 = 2*(L-2)).

So, for each segment, the possible splits are the options of splitting it into 1, 2, ..., floor((L-1)/2) steps, with corresponding cost and gain.

Thus, each segment can contribute multiple items to the knapsack problem.

But with n up to 80, and each segment's possible splits up to 40 (for L=80), the number of items can be up to 80 *40=3200, which is manageable.

The knapsack's capacity is up to max_steps (3160 for n=80), and for each step count k, we need to compute the maximum gain possible.

Once the maximum gain is known, the answer for each k is total_0_pairs - (initial_sum - max_gain).

Thus, the approach is:

1. Compute the initial segments of 0s.

2. For each segment, generate all possible split options (i steps for i=1 to floor((L-1)/2)), with cost i and gain i*(L -i).

3. Use unbounded knapsack dynamic programming to compute the maximum gain for each step count up to the maximum possible.

But wait, the splits for a segment are not unbounded. For a segment of length L, the maximum number of splits is floor((L-1)/2). Each split is a step in the segment. So each split for the segment is a single option. So for each segment, the possible options are to take any number of splits from 0 to floor((L-1)/2), each split i steps costing i steps and giving i*(L-i) gain.

But this is not correct. For example, a segment of length L=5 can be split into 2 steps (i=2), which gives gain 2*(5-2) =6. But this is the same as splitting into two steps, each of 1 step (gain 4+2=6). So the options are not additive. Thus, the maximum gain for a segment is achieved by taking as many splits as possible. For example, if a segment can be split up to m times, the optimal is to take all m splits, which gives a gain of m*(L -m).

But wait, for L=5, m=2 splits (i=2) gives gain 2*(5-2)=6. Which is indeed the same as doing two individual splits of 1 step each (gain 4+2=6). So for the knapsack, it's equivalent. Thus, for the knapsack, the options for a segment can be represented as for each possible i (number of splits), cost i and gain i*(L -i). This way, taking i splits for a segment is equivalent to making i individual splits.

But since each split for the same segment can be done multiple times (as long as i does not exceed the maximum possible splits), it's an unbounded knapsack. But in reality, each segment can be split a limited number of times. So it's a 0-1 knapsack with multiple items for each segment.

Alternatively, for each segment, we can generate all possible i splits (i from 1 to m), and treat them as individual items. Then, perform a 0-1 knapsack (each item can be taken at most once) to select which splits to take.

Thus, the problem becomes a multiple-choice knapsack problem where for each segment, you can choose to take any number of splits up to its maximum, and each choice of i splits for a segment adds cost i and gain i*(L -i).

So the knapsack DP state would be:

dp[j] = the maximum gain possible with j steps.

Initially, dp[0] = 0.

For each segment's splits (i steps, gain g), we update the DP as follows:

for j from max_steps down to i:

    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - i] + g)

Thus, after processing all possible splits for all segments, dp[k] holds the maximum gain achievable with k steps.

This approach is feasible if the number of possible splits is manageable.

But for n=80 and segments of length up to 80, each segment can generate up to 40 splits. The total number of items is 80 *40=3200. The knapsack capacity is 3160. The DP array has size 3161. For each item, we process each capacity in reverse. The time complexity is O(3160 * 3200) = about 10 million operations, which is acceptable.

Thus, the steps for the solution are:

1. Parse the input, compute the initial shield positions and the initial segments of 0s.

2. Compute the initial_sum (sum of (L*(L-1))//2 for each segment).

3. Compute total_0 = sum of L for each segment. Then, total_0_pairs = (total_0 * (total_0 -1))//2.

4. For each segment of length L, generate all possible split options: i from 1 to floor((L-1)/2), with cost i and gain i*(L -i).

5. Use a 0-1 knapsack DP approach to compute for each k (steps) the maximum gain possible.

6. For each k from 0 to max_steps (n*(n-1)/2), the maximum protection is total_0_pairs - (initial_sum - max_gain[k]).

But wait, the initial_sum is the sum of (L choose 2) for all segments. The maximum gain is the total reduction in the sum. So the new sum after k steps is initial_sum - max_gain[k]. Thus, the protected pairs are total_0_pairs - (initial_sum - max_gain[k]) = (total_0_pairs - initial_sum) + max_gain[k].

But the initial protection is (total_0_pairs - initial_sum), and each gain adds to the protection.

Thus, the output for each k is the initial protection plus the max_gain[k], clamped to the maximum possible (which is when all possible splits are made).

Now, the code implementation.

Let's outline the steps in code:

- Read n and a list of 0s and 1s.

- Compute the initial shield positions (indices where a[i] is 1). Let's assume the input is 1-based or 0-based? The problem statement says the lemmings are numbered from 1 to n, so the input is likely 1-based. So for a list a of length n, the shields are at positions i+1 (0-based index in Python) if a[i] is 1.

Wait, the input is given as a list of a_i, where i ranges from 1 to n. So for Python's 0-based lists, the shields are at positions [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]. For example, input 5: 1 0 0 0 1 would have shields at positions 0 and 4 (0-based, corresponding to 1 and 5 in 1-based).

The initial segments are computed by looking at the positions between the shields.

For example, shields are sorted. So after sorting, for shields s = [s_0, s_1, ..., s_{m-1}], the segments are:

- before the first shield: 0 to s_0 -1.

- between shields s[i-1] and s[i]: s[i-1] +1 to s[i] -1.

- after the last shield: s[-1] +1 to n-1.

The length of each segment is (end - start +1). For example, if start is 0 and end is 2, the length is 3.

Wait, for a segment from start to end (inclusive), the length is end - start +1. But since these are positions of 0s, we need to compute the length of the segment.

Once the segments are computed, generate the split options.

For each segment of length L:

possible splits are i from 1 to m, where m = (L-1) // 2. For each i, cost is i steps, gain is i*(L -i).

But wait, for a segment of length L, the maximum number of splits is m = (L-1) // 2. Because each split reduces the remaining segment length by 2.

For example, L=5: (5-1)//2 = 2. So i can be 1 or 2.

For i=1: gain 1*(5-1) =4, cost 1.

For i=2: gain 2*(5-2) =6, cost 2.

For i=3: not allowed.

Thus, for each segment, generate all possible i from 1 to (L-1)//2.

Once all the split options are generated, run the knapsack DP.

The DP array is initialized to -infinity, with dp[0] = 0.

For each split option (cost, gain), we iterate over the DP array from back to front to prevent reusing the same item multiple times (since each split option is a single choice for i steps for that segment).

Once all split options are processed, the DP array holds the maximum gain for each possible step count.

The final output is for each k from 0 to max_steps (which is (n*(n-1))//2), compute initial_protection + dp[k], and then take the maximum between all dp[k] up to the current k.

Wait, no. Because the DP is built to track the maximum gain for exactly k steps. But for the problem, the question is to compute for each k, the maximum gain achievable with at most k steps.

So after building the DP array, for each k in 0 to max_steps, the maximum gain up to k steps is the maximum of dp[0], dp[1], ..., dp[k].

Thus, after filling the DP array, we need to compute a running maximum array, where for each k, the value is the maximum gain achievable with up to k steps.

Once this is done, the output for each k is initial_protection + running_max[k].

For example, if the DP array for k=3 is 5, but for k=2 it's 6, then the running max for k=3 would be 6.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Generate all split options.

2. Compute the DP array for exact steps.

3. Compute the running maximum array.

4. For each k, compute initial_protection + running_max[k].

Now, code:

First, read the input.

Then compute the initial shields.

Compute the segments.

Compute the initial_sum and total_0.

Generate the split options.

Run the knapsack DP.

Compute the running maximum.

Output the initial_protection + running_max[k] for each k up to max_steps.

Now, let's code this.

Sample Input 1:

5

1 0 0 0 1

Shields are at positions 0 and 4 (0-based).

Segments:

Before first shield: positions 0-0-1 (no, first shield is 0, so before is none.

Between shields: positions 0+1=1 to 4-1=3. Length 3 (positions 1,2,3). So L=3.

After last shield: positions 4+1=5 to 4 (since n=5, 0-based ends at 4). So no.

So initial_sum is (3*2)/2 = 3. Total_0 is 3. total_0_pairs = 3*2/2 =3. Initial protection is 3-3=0.

Split options for L=3: i can be 1 (since (3-1)//2=1).

i=1: cost 1, gain 1*(3-1)=2.

So the split options are (1,2).

The knapsack for max_steps=5*4/2=10.

But in the sample input, the max steps possible is 10 (n=5, so 5*4/2=10 steps allowed). But the output has 11 numbers (k from 0 to 10).

After processing the split option (1,2):

The DP array after step 0 is 0.

For k=1, the maximum gain is 2.

For k=2, can't add another split (since the segment can't be split more than once).

Thus, the running_max array will be:

k=0:0

k=1:2

k>=2:2

So for the sample input, the output would be 0 (for k=0), then 2 for k=1, and 2 for higher k's. But the sample output is 0 2 3 3 3 etc.

Wait, this suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, what's wrong here.

In the first sample input:

Initial segments are one segment of length 3 (0-based positions 1,2,3).

The split options are i=1 (cost 1, gain 2). So the maximum gain for k=1 is 2. The initial protection is 0. So the output for k=1 is 0+2=2, which matches the sample.

But in the sample output, after k=2, the protection becomes 3.

Hmm. So according to the sample, there is a way to get a gain of 3 with 2 steps.

But according to the split options generated for the segment of length 3, the only possible split is i=1 steps with gain 2. So the code's approach would not generate that.

Ah, so the approach is missing something. What's the problem?

Ah, because the initial approach models splits as moving shields into a segment by 1 step each. But in reality, the movement of shields can split the segment into two parts, and then the new segments can be split further.

But in the code's current approach, the split options for a segment are generated as i steps (moving a shield i times into the segment), which splits it into i+1 segments. But in reality, each split creates new segments that can be split again.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. It only considers splitting the initial segments once, but not the new segments generated after each split.

This is a critical mistake.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect, and we need to model the possible splits of all segments, including those generated after previous splits.

This changes everything. So the previous approach of generating splits for each initial segment is not sufficient.

This explains why the sample input's code approach would not generate the correct answer. For the first sample input:

After splitting the initial segment of length 3 with i=1 steps (gain 2), the new segments would be of lengths 0 and 3-1-1=1 (since moving the left shield once to the right splits the segment into 0 and 1 0s. But the 0-length segment contributes nothing. The new segment of length 1 can be split with i=0 steps (since (1-1)/2=0).

So the split options for the new segment are none.

But in the sample input, after two steps, the gain is 3. How is this possible?

In the sample input, after two steps:

- Move the left shield (0) to the right once (cost 1). New shield at 1. Segments are 0 (left), 0 (middle between 1 and 4). The middle segment is now positions 2-3 (length 2).

- Move the right shield (4) to the left once (cost 1). New shield at 3. Segments are 0 (middle between 1 and 3) (length 0), and 4 (position 4 is a shield).

Now, the new segments are the initial left shield's new position, the right shield's new position, and between them, a segment of length 1 (positions 2) between shields 1 and 3. This can be split again by moving shield 1 to the right once (cost 1, gain 0).

So the total steps is 2, and the sum of splits is:

Initial sum is 3.

First split: gain 2 (steps 1).

Second split: split the new segment of length 1 (positions 2 between shields 1 and 3) by moving shield 1 to the right once. Gain is 0 (1-1=0). So total gain is 2 +0=2. But according to the sample, the gain is 3.

Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, in the sample explanation, after two steps:

- The first step is moving the left shield (position 0) to the right once (position 1).

- The second step is moving the right shield (position 4) to the left once (position 3).

The initial segment of 3 0s is split into two segments:

- Between 1 and 3: 0s at positions 2. Length 1.

- Between 3 and 4: 0s at position 3. Length 0.

Wait, the new shields are at 1 and 3. So the segment between them is positions 2 (length 1).

The sum after two splits is (0 choose 2) for the left segment (length 0), (1 choose 2) for the middle (0), and (0 choose 2) for the right. So sum is 0. The initial sum was 3. So the gain is 3 -0 =3. So the code's approach of only splitting the initial segment once (gain 2) is missing the gain from splitting another segment.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect because it does not consider splits of new segments created during the process.

Thus, the correct approach must model all possible splits of all segments, including those generated dynamically as shields are moved.

This requires a different approach than the previous knapsack idea.

So back to the drawing board.

Alternative approach inspired by the problem's sample:

Each split of a segment into two new segments allows for further splits of those new segments.

Thus, the process is to track all current segments and possible splits, and select the ones that give the maximum gain per step.

This is a priority queue approach, where each possible split is represented by a segment and the cost and gain of splitting it. The priority queue is sorted by gain per step (or just gain, since each step is 1).

Each time a segment is split, new segments are added to the list, and their possible splits are added to the priority queue.

The steps taken are cumulative, and for each possible k, the maximum gain up to that k is tracked.

This approach is correct, but how to efficiently manage the priority queue and track the maximum gain for each k.

Here's how it works:

1. Compute the initial segments of 0s.

2. For each initial segment, calculate the possible split (moving left or right shield once), which gives a gain of (L-1) and cost 1 step.

3. Add these possible splits to a max-heap (priority queue), sorted by gain (since each split is one step).

4. Keep track of the current segments and their possible splits.

5. For each step from 1 to max_steps:

   a. Extract the split with the highest gain.

   b. Apply the split, adding the steps and gain.

   c. Add the new segments created by the split to the list.

   d. For each new segment, compute its possible split (gain L-1) and add to the priority queue.

   e. Record the cumulative gain for the current step.

6. After processing all possible splits up to k steps, for each k, the maximum gain is the sum of the gains of the first k splits.

But since the steps are processed in order of their gain, the first k splits will give the maximum possible gain for k steps.

This is a greedy approach, and it may not always be optimal. However, in the sample input, this approach would correctly capture the two splits:

First, split the initial segment of length 3 (gain 2, cost 1).

Then, split the new segment of length 1 (gain 0, cost 1). But this doesn't contribute anything.

But according to the sample, after two steps, the gain is 3. So this approach is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the split options need to include both options (moving left or right shield) for each segment.

For example, the initial segment of length 3 can be split by moving the left shield once (gain 2) or the right shield once (gain 2).

But in the code's initial approach, each split option for a segment is considered once. But perhaps the same segment can be split multiple times, each time moving different shields.

This complicates things.

Alternatively, each time a segment is split into two new segments, each new segment can be split again by moving their respective shields.

Thus, the priority queue approach is needed to dynamically generate possible splits.

Let's model this:

Each segment has a left shield (x) and a right shield (y). The length is L = y -x -1.

To split this segment, we can move x to the right by 1 step (cost 1, gain L-1) or move y to the left by 1 step (cost 1, gain L-1).

Each split creates two new segments: for example, moving x to x+1 creates a new segment from x+2 to y-1 (length L-1-1 = L-2).

Similarly, moving y to y-1 creates a new segment from x+1 to y-2 (length L-2).

The new segments can then be split again.

Thus, the priority queue approach would process splits in the order of their gain (L-1), which is the gain per split.

For the first sample:

Initial segment: x=0, y=4, L=3.

Possible splits:

Move x to 1 (gain 2, cost 1).

Move y to 3 (gain 2, cost 1).

Both options have gain 2.

Suppose we choose to move x first. New segments are:

- from 0 to 0 (length 0).

- from 2 to 3 (length 2).

The new segments are of lengths 0 and 2.

For the new segment of length 2, possible splits:

Move x (now at 1) to 2 (gain 1, cost 1).

Move y (still at 4) to 3 (gain 1, cost 1).

So adding these to the priority queue (gain 1 each).

Next, for the second step, choose the other initial split (moving y to 3), which also gives gain 2. But this would create segments of length 2 (from x=0 to y=3-1=2) and 0.

But this would have two splits with gain 2, totaling gain 4 after two steps. Which is what the sample requires.

Ah, so in this case, the sample's maximum gain after two steps is 3. But according to this approach, it would be 4.

This is a problem. This suggests that the priority queue approach is not correct.

Wait, what's the actual maximum gain in the sample.

In the sample input, after two steps, the sum is 0. So gain is 3.

But according to the priority queue approach, after two steps:

- first split: gain 2.

- second split: gain 2.

Total gain 4. So sum becomes 3-4= -1. But sum can't be negative.

But this is impossible. So the priority queue approach is not correct.

Hmm. There's a mistake here.

In reality, after moving x to the right once (gain 2, cost 1), the segment of length 3 becomes two segments: 0 length and 2 length.

The 2-length segment can be split by moving x (now at 1) to the right once (cost 1, gain 2-1=1). This would create a segment of 0 and 0.

So the gain for the second step is 1.

Thus, total gain is 2+1=3, which matches the sample.

But why the priority queue approach would have two gains of 2?

Ah, because the initial splits are of the two options (move x or move y).

So, the first split is moving x (gain 2), the second split is moving y (gain 2).

But this is only possible if there are two initial segments to split.

But in reality, after the first split of moving x, the initial segment is split into two new segments, and the other option (moving y) is no longer available.

Thus, the priority queue approach must track the current segments and the available splits.

This is a key insight. The initial split options are for the initial segments, and after splitting a segment, new segments are added, and their possible splits are added to the queue.

Thus, the priority queue approach would work as follows:

Initial segments: [0-4 (length 3)].

Possible splits: split this segment (gain 2, cost 1), two options.

Add both to the priority queue.

The priority queue contains two possible splits: gain 2, cost 1 each.

First step: take one of them, say, split by moving x. Gain 2, steps 1.

New segments: length 0 and length 2.

Possible splits for the new segment of length 2: split by moving x (now at 1) to 2 (gain 1, cost 1), or moving y (still at 4) to 3 (gain 1, cost 1). Add these to the queue.

Queue now has:

- split the new 2-length segment (gain 1, cost 1).

- the other initial split (gain 2, cost 1).

Next step: choose the initial split with gain 2 (moving y). Apply it: gain 2, steps 2.

New segments: original segment is split into length 2 and 0.

Now, the sum of gains is 2 +2 =4.

But the sample says the maximum gain after 2 steps is 3. So this is a contradiction.

Ah, but why? Because moving both shields (x and y) is possible, but in reality, each movement is of a different shield.

Let's think:

Initial configuration: shields at 0 and 4.

After moving x (0) to 1: shields are at 1 and 4.

Segment between them is 2-3 (length 2).

After moving y (4) to 3: shields are at 1 and 3.

Segment between them is 2-2 (length 1).

Sum of segments: 0 (from 0-0), 1 (from 2-2), and 0 (from 4-4).

Sum is (1*0)/2 =0. Initial sum was 3. So gain is 3-0=3.

Total steps: 2.

Thus, the gain is 3. But according to the priority queue approach, the steps would have been 2, and the gain is 4. So something is wrong.

This indicates that the priority queue approach is not correctly model the gain. Because the code's approach assumes that each split adds a gain of (L-1), but in reality, the split of the initial segment into two segments and then splitting one of them again may not be possible in that order.

Thus, the problem is more complex than initially thought, and the initial approaches are not correct.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem using a priority queue where each possible split (of any segment) is considered, and the splits are processed in order of their gain per step. The maximum gain is accumulated for each step count.

But how to model this correctly.

Each split is a movement of either the left or right shield of a segment. For example, a segment between x and y can be split by moving x to x+1 (cost 1, gain L-1) or y to y-1 (cost 1, gain L-1).

After moving x to x+1, the new segments are (x+1+1) to y-1. So new length is (y-1) - (x+1) +1 = y -x -2 = L-2.

The new segments are [x, x+1] (length 0) and [x+2, y-1] (length L-2).

Thus, each split of a segment can generate new segments that can be split again.

Thus, the priority queue approach would process all possible splits of all current segments, ordered by their gain (L-1) for each split.

Thus, for the sample input:

Initial split options:

- split the initial segment (L=3) by moving left shield or right shield, each gain 2.

Step 1: process one of them. Assume move left shield. Gain 2. Steps 1. New segments are length 0 and 2.

Add splits for the 2-length segment: gain 1 each.

Step 2: process the other initial split (moving right shield). Gain 2. Steps 2. New segments are 2 and 0.

But this is not possible because after step 1, the initial segment no longer exists.

Ah, this is the error. Once a segment is split, it is replaced by new segments, so any pending splits for the original segment are no longer valid.

Thus, the priority queue must track the current segments and their possible splits, and when a segment is split, its splits are removed from the queue, and new splits are added.

This complicates the approach, as the priority queue needs to dynamically update based on the current segments.

Thus, this approach may not be feasible to implement efficiently.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample's gain of 3 with 2 steps:

The initial split of the segment (gain 2 steps 1) and then split the new segment (gain 1 steps 1) gives total gain 3 steps 2.

Thus, the priority queue approach should process the highest gain splits first.

But how to model this.

In the sample, after step 1, the new segments are 0 and 2. The 2-length segment can be split for gain 1.

The initial splits (gain 2) are still present in the queue. But after step 1, the initial segment is split and no longer exists, so the pending splits for the initial segment should be removed.

But this is not handled in the priority queue approach.

Thus, this suggests that the priority queue approach is not correct, as it can have splits for segments that no longer exist.

Thus, the correct approach must model the current segments and their possible splits, and when a segment is split, new splits are added, and any old splits for that segment are removed.

But this requires a way to track which segments are currently active and which splits are possible.

This is difficult to implement, especially for large n.

Given the time constraints and the problem's size (n up to 80), perhaps the correct approach is to use dynamic programming with state represented as a list of current segments, but this is computationally infeasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial knapsack approach can be modified to account for the fact that each segment can be split multiple times, each time generating new segments.

But this seems difficult.

Given the time, perhaps I need to look for another way.

An alternative idea: each split of a segment of length L into two segments of lengths a and b (a + b +1 = L) gives a gain of (L*(L-1)/2) - (a*(a-1)/2 + b*(b-1)/2) = (L(L-1) -a(a-1) -b(b-1))/2.

But a + b +1 = L → a + b = L-1.

The gain is:

(L(L-1) -a(a-1) - (L-1 -a)(L-2 -a))/2.

Simplify:

= [ L^2 - L - a^2 +a - ( (L-1 -a)(L-2 -a) ) ] / 2.

Expanding (L-1 -a)(L-2 -a) = (L-1)(L-2) -a(2L-3) + a^2.

But this may not help.

But for a fixed L, the maximum gain is achieved when a and b are as close as possible.

Thus, the optimal split is to split the segment into two as equal parts as possible, which gives the maximum possible gain.

But this requires multiple steps.

Thus, the initial approach of considering splits in terms of the number of steps needed to split a segment into i splits may still be valid, but the code must account for all possible splits for all segments, including new ones.

But how.

Perhaps the problem can be modeled using a priority queue where each possible split of any current segment is considered, and the split with the highest gain per step is chosen first.

Each split has a cost of 1 step and a gain of (L-1), where L is the current length of the segment.

This is because each split is moving a shield by one step into the segment, reducing the segment's length by 2.

Thus, the maximum possible gain for each split is (L-1), and each split takes 1 step.

Thus, the priority queue is a max-heap ordered by (L-1).

For each step, the segment with the largest (L-1) is split, generating two new segments.

This approach would greedily choose to split the largest segment first, which is optimal.

Let's test this on the sample input.

Sample input:

Initial segments: [L=3].

Step 1: split L=3 → gain 2. New segments: 0 and 2.

Step 2: split L=2 → gain 1. New segments: 0 and 0.

Total gain: 2+1=3. Steps:2. Which matches the sample.

Another example: after step 1, the new segments are 0 and 2. The priority queue has 2.

Step 2: split the 2-length segment → gain 1. Total gain 3.

Thus, the code's approach would work.

Thus, the priority queue approach is correct.

So the steps are:

1. Compute all initial segments.

2. Push all initial segments into a max-heap, ordered by (L-1), where L is the segment's length.

3. Initialize the gain array, where gain[k] is the total gain after k steps.

4. For k from 1 to max_steps:

   a. If the heap is empty, break.

   b. Pop the segment with the largest (L-1).

   c. current_gain = L-1.

   d. total_gain += current_gain.

   e. Add new segments of length (L-1 -1) = L-2 (since splitting into 0 and L-2).

   f. Push the new segments (if L-2 >= 1) into the heap.

   g. Record gain[k] = total_gain.

5. Compute the running maximum for each k.

This approach seems correct.

For the sample input:

Initial heap: [3].

Step 1:

Pop 3 → gain 2. New segments: 0 and 2.

Push 2.

gain[1] =2.

Step 2:

Pop 2 → gain 1. New segments: 0 and 0.

Push nothing.

gain[2] =3.

Steps 3 and beyond: heap is empty, so gain remains 3.

Thus, for k=2, the gain is 3. For k>=2, gain is 3.

This matches the sample.

Another example: input where the initial segment is L=5.

Steps:

k=1: split 5 → gain 4. New segments 0 and 3. Push 3.

k=2: split 3 → gain 2. New segments 0 and 1. Push 1.

k=3: split 1 → gain 0. New segments 0 and 0. Push nothing.

gain[3] =4+2+0=6.

Thus, for k=3, the gain is 6.

But the maximum possible gain is (5*4/2) -0 =10 → total gain 10 - initial sum.

But wait, initial sum is 5*4/2 =10. So total gain is 10-10=0, which is not correct.

Wait, no. The initial sum is 10. The maximum possible gain is 10. Thus, the total sum after all splits is 0.

But according to this approach:

After 2 steps, gain is 6 → sum becomes 10-6=4.

After 3 steps, gain is 6 → sum becomes 4.

But further steps can split other segments.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Another example: initial segment of L=5.

The initial sum is 5*4/2=10.

The maximum possible gain is 10 → sum becomes 0.

Which requires splitting the segment into segments of 0 length. How?

Each split reduces the sum by (L-1) per step.

For L=5:

Step 1: gain 4, sum 10-4=6.

Step 2: split new segment of L=3 (gain 2), sum 6-2=4.

Step 3: split new segment of L=1 (gain 0), sum remains 4.

Thus, this approach would only get a gain of 6, but the maximum possible is 10.

But this suggests that the approach is not correct.

Ah, the problem is that the approach only considers splitting the segment once per step, but there are other ways to split the segment.

For example, moving the left shield multiple times.

For L=5:

Initial segment between x and y.

Move x to the right once: gain 4, cost 1. New segment L=3.

Move x to the right again: new segment L=1. gain 2, cost 1.

Move x to the right again: new segment L=0. gain 0, cost 1.

But each movement of x is a separate step, and each step gives a gain of (current L -1).

For L=5:

Step 1: gain 4, L=3.

Step 2: gain 2, L=1.

Step 3: gain 0.

Total gain 6.

But the maximum possible gain is 10, which requires moving the shield 3 times to split the segment into 0,0,0,0. Which is impossible.

But how?

Wait, the initial segment of L=5 can be split into four segments of 0 by moving the left and right shields multiple times.

But each split can be done by moving either shield once.

For example:

Initial L=5.

Step 1: move left shield once → gain 4. L=3.

Step 2: move right shield once → gain 4 (L=3 now). No, after step 1, the segment is L=3. Moving the right shield once would gain 2.

Thus, the approach's maximum gain is 4+2+0=6, but the maximum possible gain is 10.

This suggests that the approach is not correct.

But according to the problem's rules, the initial sum is 10. To achieve a sum of 0, all segments must be of length 0.

But for a segment of length 5, the maximum possible splits are floor((5-1)/2) = 2 splits. Each split reduces the segment into smaller parts. For example:

Split 1: gain 4 → sum 6.

Split 2: gain 2 → sum 4.

No more possible splits.

Thus, the maximum possible gain is 6.

But the initial sum is 10. So the maximum possible gain is 6, and the sum becomes 4. But the initial approach's calculation is correct.

Thus, the priority queue approach is correct.

Thus, the code should use this approach.

Thus, the steps to implement are:

- Compute the initial segments.

- Create a max-heap based on (L-1).

- Compute the gain for each step by popping the largest segment each time.

- Accumulate the gain for each step.

- For steps beyond the available splits, the gain remains the same.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read the input.

Compute the initial segments.

Initialize a max-heap, sorted by the current segment's (L-1).

Compute the initial_sum.

Compute the initial_protection.

total_0 = sum of L for initial segments.

total_0_pairs = total_0 * (total_0 -1) // 2.

Now, the maximum possible steps is n*(n-1)//2.

We need to compute the gain for each step up to this maximum.

The heap will be processed step by step.

For each step k from 1 to max_steps:

   if the heap is not empty, extract the largest segment (L-1).

   add the gain (L-1) to the current total_gain.

   split the segment into two new segments of lengths 0 and (L-2).

   push the new segment of length (L-2) into the heap if it's >=1.

   record the total_gain for step k.

After processing, the gain for step k is the sum of all gains up to that step.

But since the heap may be empty before reaching max_steps, for steps beyond the available splits, the gain remains the same.

We then need to build an array of gains for each step, and then compute the running maximum for each k.

For example, after processing all possible splits, any steps beyond the total possible splits will have the same maximum gain as the last possible split.

Thus, the code can be written as:

Testing against sample input 1.

    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    if shields:
        first = shields[0]
        if first > 0:
            segments.append(first)
    else:
        # all are 0s
        segments.append(n)
        # but if there are no shields, all 0s are unsegmented, so sum is (n*(n-1))//2. But according to the problem, each 0s must have a shield between them to be protected. So if no shields, all pairs are unprotected. Thus, sum is (n*(n-1))//2.

    if not segments:
        # if no shields and no 0s (unlikely)
        pass

```

Wait, in the sample, the correct steps after 2 steps gives a gain of 3. But according to the code's approach, the second step would process the new segment of length 1.

But when L=1, L-1=0. So when the code processes L=1, it adds 0 to the gain.

But according to the problem's sample explanation, after two steps, the gain is 3.

So why is the code's approach giving a gain of 2?

Ah, because the code's approach is incorrect. It's not considering the possibility of splitting the segment by moving the right shield.

In the sample input:

After moving the left shield (0) to the right once (gain 2), the new segments are 0 and 2 (between 1 and 4).

The segment of length 2 can be split by moving the right shield (4) to the left once (gain 2-1=1).

But in the code's approach, this new segment of length 2 is pushed into the heap. So for step 2:

The heap would have a segment of length 2, which when split gives a gain of 1.

Thus, code's approach for step 2 would process that segment.

But in the code's current implementation, after step 1, the new segment of length 3-2=1 is pushed into the heap. But that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the code.

In the code:

When a segment of length L is split, it is replaced by two new segments: 0 and (L-2).

But when we split a segment of length L by moving a shield once, the new segment is of length L-2.

But in reality, splitting a segment of length L by moving a shield once creates two new segments: one of length 0 and one of length L-1-1 = L-2.

Thus, the code's approach is correct.

But in the sample, after splitting the initial segment of length 3, the new segment is of length 1 (3-2=1). Thus, when the code processes this segment in step 2, it's gain is 0.

But according to the sample, after two steps, the gain should be 3.

This suggests that the code's approach is not correct.

But according to the code's approach, after step 1, the new segment is of length 1 (3-2=1). Thus, the gain for step 2 is 0.

But the sample requires that after two steps, the gain is 3. So there's a mistake in the code.

Ah, I think the code is not considering that there are two possible ways to split the initial segment: moving the left shield or the right shield.

But the code's approach pushes only one new segment for each split.

Thus, the code is incorrect.

The problem is that when a segment is split by moving either the left or right shield, the code's approach should create two possible new segments and allow both to be split.

But in the code's current approach, each split is considered as moving a shield once, and the new segment is pushed once.

Thus, the code's approach is missing possible splits by moving other shields.

Thus, the code is incorrect.

Thus, the priority queue approach is not sufficient.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model each possible split of each segment into two possible options: moving the left shield or the right shield, and track these as separate splits.

But this would require a priority queue that can manage these two possibilities.

But this would make the code more complex.

Thus, the correct approach is to model each split as a possible option, and track the current segments and their left and right shields.

But this would require a more complex data structure.

Given the time, perhaps the correct solution is to model each possible split as a separate possible action, but this is challenging.

Given the time constraints and the problem's sample, the correct approach is to use a priority queue that allows for splitting both shields of a segment.

Thus, each segment is represented with its left and right shields, and for each split, both options are considered.

But this is complicated and beyond the time available.

Thus, the correct code for the problem is as follows, using the priority queue approach as described earlier, but this code will not pass the sample. But according to the sample, it's incorrect.

Thus, there's a mistake in the code's approach.

After re-examining the sample:

The initial segment is 3. The code's approach splits this into 0 and 2.

The new segment of length 2 is pushed into the heap.

Step 2: split the 2-length segment, gain 1. Thus, total gain is 2+1=3.

Thus, the code's approach must push the new segment of length 2 into the heap.

But in the code's current implementation, when a segment of length 3 is split, new_L =3-2=1.

This is incorrect. Because splitting a segment of length L by moving a shield once reduces the segment length by 2.

Yes. For example, L=3. Moving a shield once creates a new segment of length 3-2=1.

But in reality, moving a shield once into a segment of length 3 splits it into 0 and 2.

Thus, new_L is 2, not 1.

This is the mistake in the code.

Ah, this is a critical error in the code.

The new segment length after splitting is L-2, not L-1-1.

Wait, no.

The initial code's logic is:

When a segment of length L is split, the new segment is L-2.

But when L=3, the new segment is L-2=1.

But according to the sample, after splitting a segment of length 3, the new segment is length 2.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect.

Thus, the error is in the code's calculation of new_L.

When a segment of length L is split once, the new segment's length is L-1-1= L-2.

Yes. For example, L=3:

After moving a shield once, the new segment is of length 3-1-1=1.

But in reality, after splitting, the new segment's length is 2.

Ah, this is a miscalculation.

Let me re-examine:

A segment of length L is between shields x and y. So x and y are the positions of the shields.

The length of the segment is (y - x - 1) = L.

When you move the left shield (x) to x+1, the new segment between x+1 and y is (y - (x+1) -1) = y -x -2 = L-1-1 = L-2.

Thus, new segment length is L-2.

For example, L=3: new segment length is 1.

But according to the sample, after splitting a segment of length 3, the new segment has length 2.

This suggests that the code's calculation is incorrect.

No, according to the sample explanation:

After moving the left shield (0) to 1 (0-based), the new segment is between 1 and 4, which is positions 2,3. Length 2.

Thus, new_L is 2.

But according to the code's logic, new_L is 3-2=1.

This is a discrepancy.

Ah, the code's calculation of new_L is incorrect.

Thus, the error is in the code's handling of new_L.

The code computes new_L = L - 2.

But for the sample's case, L is 3. new_L = 3-2=1. But the actual new segment length is 2.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect.

Ah, the error is that the code treats L as the segment length, but when you split the segment by moving a shield once, the new segment's length is L-1-1= L-2.

But in reality, the new segment's length is (y-1) - (x+1) +1 = (y - x -1 -1) +1 = (L-1) -1 +1 = L-1.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Original segment between x and y: length L = y -x -1.

After moving x to x+1: new segment is between x+1 and y.

Length is y - (x+1) -1 = y -x -2 = L-1.

Thus, new_L is L-1-1 = L-2?

No, no:

Original L = y -x -1.

After moving x to x+1, the new segment is between x+1 and y. So:

new_length = (y) - (x+1) -1 = y - x -2 = (y -x -1) -1 = L-1.

But this is not possible. Because the original length is L = y -x -1.

After moving x to x+1, the new segment is between x+1 and y.

The number of 0s in this new segment is (y - (x+1) -1) +1? Or is it (y - (x+1) -1) ?

Wait, the positions of 0s are from x+1+1 to y-1.

Wait, x+1 is the new shield position.

The new segment is between x+1 and y.

Thus, the positions of 0s are (x+1)+1 to y-1.

Thus, the length is (y-1) - (x+1+1) +1 = y -x -3.

But this is y-x-3 = (y-x-1) -2 = L-2.

Thus, new_L is L-2.

Thus, for a segment of length L=3, new_L is 1.

But in the sample, after moving x once, the new segment is 2. So this is a contradiction.

Ah, the sample's original segment is between shields 0 and 4 (0-based). So L=3.

After moving x=0 to 1, the new segment is between 1 and 4. The positions are 2,3. Length is 2.

Thus, new_L is 2. But according to the code's logic, new_L =3-2=1.

This indicates that the code's calculation of new_L is incorrect.

Thus, the error is in the code's logic for new_L.

The correct new_L is L-1.

Thus, the code should set new_L = L-1.

Thus, the code's line:

new_L = L -2

Is incorrect. It should be new_L = L-1.

But why?

Because moving a shield once into the segment reduces the length by 1.

Wait, the original segment is length L.

After moving a shield once into the segment, the new segment is length L-1.

For example:

L=3:

After moving once, new segment is length 2.

Thus, new_L = L-1 = 2.

Thus, the code's new_L should be L-1, not L-2.

This is the critical mistake in the code.

Thus, the code's line:

new_L = L-2

should be replaced with:

new_L = L -1

Thus, in the code:

For each split:

current_gain += (L-1)

new_L = L-1

push new_L into heap if new_L >=1.

This fixes the calculation.

Let's re-examine the sample input.

Sample input:

Initial segment L=3.

Step 1: split L=3 → gain 2. new_L=2.

Push 2.

gain[1] =2.

Step 2: split L=2 → gain 1. new_L=1.

Push 1.

gain[2] =3.

Step 3: split L=1 → gain 0. new_L=0. not pushed.

gain[3] =3.

Thus, for steps 2, the gain is 3, which matches the sample.

Thus, the correct code should have new_L = L-1.

Thus, the code's error was in calculating new_L = L-2 instead of L-1.

Correcting this should fix the code.

Thus, the correct code is as follows.
