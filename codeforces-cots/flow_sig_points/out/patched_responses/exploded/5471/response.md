Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the goal is to maximize the total joy levels of all players based on how we distribute the cards. Each player has a favorite number, and they get joy based on how many of their k cards match their favorite number. The h array gives the joy for t=1 to t=k, but if they have zero, it's zero. And the h values are strictly increasing for each step, which is important.

First, I need to think about how to model this. The key here is that for each player, the number of cards they receive that match their favorite number will determine their contribution to the total. So the problem is essentially a matter of assigning as many favorite cards as possible to each player in a way that maximizes the sum, considering the h values.

Let me break down the steps.

1. For each favorite number in the players' list, count how many times that number appears in the cards. Because a player can only use the cards of their own favorite number. So, for example, if there are players with favorite number 2, the total number of 2's in the cards will be allocated to those players. Other players can't use those cards.

So the first step is to group the cards by their value. Then, for each player's favorite number, we have a count of how many cards are available for that favorite. But if multiple players have the same favorite, they have to split the available cards of that value.

So the plan is:

- Count the frequency of each card. So for all c_i, create a frequency map.
- Then, for each player's favorite f_j, check how many cards exist in c that match f_j. Let's call this count as cnt.
- Then, the problem reduces to distributing these cnt cards among the players who have f_j as their favorite, such that each such player can take up to k cards (since each player gets exactly k cards, but the cards that are not their favorite can be anything else). Wait, no. Wait, the cards that are their favorite are the ones contributing to their joy. The other cards can be any other numbers, but those don't affect the joy. So when distributing the cards, for a player, the number of their favorite cards they get (t) can range from 0 to min(k, available), but the total across all players with that favorite can't exceed the total available for that favorite.

Wait, but the other cards (non-favorite) can be given to any player. So the non-favorite cards can be freely distributed as long as each player gets exactly k cards. But the problem requires that all cards are distributed. So the challenge is to allocate the favorite cards optimally.

So the crux is: for each group of players with the same favorite f, the number of cards of f that are allocated to them must not exceed the count of f in the cards. The rest of the cards (non-f) can be given to any players, as they don't affect their joy. So the optimal strategy is to assign as many favorite cards as possible to the players whose favorite is f, but in a way that maximizes the sum of h_t for the players.

But how to model this? Let's think of it as:

Each player's contribution is determined by how many of their k cards are their favorite. For a group of players with favorite f, we have S cards of f. We need to distribute these S cards among the players in the group, such that each player can take t cards (0 <= t <= k), and the sum of t's for the group is <= S. The sum for each player is h_t (h_0 is 0 if t=0). We need to maximize the sum over all players.

But also, the sum of t's across all players in the group cannot exceed the available S. So for each group (same f_j), we need to compute how to split the S cards among the m players (where m is the number of players in the group with favorite f_j) to maximize the sum of h_t, given that each t can be up to k, and sum of t's <= S.

So the problem can be broken down into independent groups. For each favorite f, count the number of players that have it (m), and the number of available cards (s). Then, for each such group, compute the maximum possible sum for the m players, given s cards and each can take t (0<=t<=k) with sum(t) <=s.

The total sum is the sum over all groups of their maximum sum. Because different groups are independent (since the cards of different favorites are allocated to different groups).

So the plan is:

- For each f in the players' favorites, count how many players (m) have that favorite. Also, count how many cards (s) are available for that favorite.

Then, for each (m, s) pair, compute the maximum possible sum of h_t's for m players, with sum(t_i) <= s, and each t_i can be between 0 and k.

So the problem reduces to solving this for each (m, s) pair.

Now, the key is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Because for each player in the group, we can assign a t_i from 0 to min(k, possible), and accumulate the sum.

But how?

Let me think. For a group with m players and s cards, each player can contribute some t between 0 and min(k, ...). But the sum of t's must be <=s.

We need to choose t_1, t_2, ..., t_m such that sum(t_i) <= s, and each t_i <=k, and the sum of h[t_i] (where h[0] is 0, h[1] is h_1, etc.) is maximized.

But since h is strictly increasing (h_{t-1} < h_t for t >=2), the optimal strategy would be to assign as many cards as possible to each player. Because h is increasing, higher t gives higher h_t. So for each player, we want to assign as many as possible, but limited by the available cards and the per-player limit (k).

Wait, but since h is strictly increasing, the optimal way to distribute the s cards among m players is to give as many as possible up to k per player, but in a way that maximizes the sum. For example, if s is more than m*k, then each player can take k, and sum is m*h_k, but s can't be more than m*k (since the group's available s is the count of their favorite cards). Wait, no. Because s is the total number of favorite cards available for the group. So s can't exceed m*k? No, because the group's players can take any of the s cards, but the total cards they take (sum of t_i) can't exceed s. But each player can take up to k cards (if they have t_i cards of their favorite, the remaining k-t_i cards can be non-favorite). But for the sum, the t_i's for the group's players can be up to min(k, s). So the sum of t_i must be <= s.

But how to model this?

Given that h is strictly increasing, the best way to maximize the sum is to assign the maximum possible t for as many players as possible, subject to the sum constraints.

Wait, for example, if we have m players and s cards. For each player, the optimal t_i would be the maximum possible, which is k, but if there are not enough cards, we have to distribute as much as possible.

But since h is increasing, the optimal is to assign as many players as possible the maximum t (k), then assign the remaining cards to some players.

So for a group of m players and s cards:

The maximum number of players that can have t_i = k is s // k. But wait, that's not correct. For example, if s=5, k=3, m=2. Then each player can take up to 3. The first takes 3, the second takes 2. So sum is 5. h_3 + h_2. Which is better than other allocations.

So the optimal way is to allocate the maximum possible to each player, in a way that uses all s cards (if possible), with each t_i up to k.

But since the h array is strictly increasing, the best way to maximize the sum is to have as many t_i as possible at the higher end.

So the algorithm for a group (m players, s cards) is:

Compute how many players can get t= k, t= k-1, etc., such that the sum is s.

But this needs to be done efficiently.

But given the constraints (m up to 500, and k up to 10), perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.

Let me think of dynamic programming. For each player in the group, we can decide how many cards (t) they get, up to min(k, available), and track the remaining cards.

The state would be dp[i][remaining] = maximum sum for the first i players and remaining cards left.

The transition would be for the i-th player, assign t cards (from 0 to min(k, remaining)), and add h[t] (h[0] is 0) to the sum.

But since h is strictly increasing, for each player, the optimal is to take as many as possible (up to k), but perhaps not, if that leaves not enough for other players. Wait, but since h is increasing, taking more cards gives a higher h value. So for a player, if possible, taking t= min(k, remaining) would be optimal. But if the remaining cards after that are less than (m-i)*0 (since other players can take 0), but that's not possible. Wait, no. Because other players can take 0 if there are no cards left. So the maximum possible for the current player is min(k, remaining). Because taking as much as possible here gives the highest possible h[t], and the remaining players can take 0. Since h is increasing, this would be better than taking less here and more for others.

So the optimal strategy is greedy: for each player in the group, assign as many cards as possible (up to k), given the remaining cards. So the maximum sum is the sum of h[t_i], where t_i is min(k, remaining) for the i-th player, but considering that after each assignment, the remaining cards decrease by t_i.

Wait, but there's a catch here. Let's say m=2, s=5, k=3. Then the optimal is 3 + 2 = sum h_3 + h_2. But if h_2 + h_3 is better than h_1 + h_4 (but since k=3, h_4 is not allowed). So the greedy approach works here.

But perhaps this is the case because h is strictly increasing. Since each higher t gives a higher h value, the optimal is to assign as much as possible to each player in order.

So for a group of m players and s cards:

Sort the players (though they are indistinct) and assign each the maximum possible t_i (up to k) in order, subtracting from s.

For example, the first player takes min(k, s) â†’ s reduces by t_i. The second takes min(k, new s), etc. Until s is zero.

But this would be the optimal approach.

Wait, let's test with some examples.

Example 1: h = [2,6,7], k=3.

Suppose for a group, m=3 players, s=5 cards.

The optimal allocation would be 3, 2, 0 â†’ sum is 7+6+0 =13. Or 2,2,1 â†’ 6+6+2=14. Wait, but wait h_3 is 7. So if s=5, m=3 players. Let's see:

If we assign 3, 2, 0 â†’ sum h is 7+6+0=13.

But if s=5, m=3: sum t_i =3+2+0=5.

Alternatively, if we assign 2,2,1 â†’ sum is 6+6+2=14. Which is better. But how can that be? Because h is strictly increasing. So h_2=6 is less than h_3=7. So in the first case, the sum is 7+6 =13. But in the second case, sum is 6+6+2=14, which is higher. So the greedy approach of assigning as much as possible gives a lower sum than another approach.

But this contradicts the assumption. So why?

Ah, because in this example, h_3 (7) is higher than h_2 (6), but h_1 (2) is lower than h_2. So the optimal is to assign t_i as 2, 2, 1. Sum is 6+6+2=14. Which is better than 3+2+0:7+6+0=13.

So the initial greedy approach of assigning as much as possible (k) to each player is not optimal. So the problem is more complex than that.

Hmm. So this implies that the problem requires a dynamic programming approach where all possible options are considered, subject to the constraints.

But with m up to 500 and k up to 10, what's the DP state?

Let's model it as follows: For each player in the group (up to 500), and remaining cards (up to s, which can be up to 500 * 10 = 5000?), we track the maximum sum possible.

The state would be DP[i][r] = maximum sum for the first i players with r remaining cards.

The transition for the i-th player would be: for each possible t (from 0 to min(k, r)), take t cards and add h[t] to the sum. Then, the next state would be DP[i+1][r - t] = max( current value, DP[i][r] + h[t] )

The initial state is DP[0][s] = 0. Then, after processing all m players, the answer for the group is the maximum DP[m][r'] where r' >=0 (but we have to use as much as possible? Wait, no. Because the sum of t_i can't exceed s. So the remaining after m players is s - sum(t_i) >=0. So the actual sum of t_i is s - remaining. But since the problem allows sum(t_i) <= s, but the remaining can be anything. But for the maximum sum, it's better to use as many as possible. Because even if some cards are left, they can't be used (since the group's players are already processed). So the maximum sum would be when the sum of t_i is as large as possible. So in the DP, after processing all m players, the maximum possible sum would be the maximum of DP[m][r] where r can be from 0 up to the initial s, but the sum is DP[m][r] where the sum of t_i is (initial s) - r.

But since the sum of t_i can't exceed s, the maximum sum would be the maximum DP[m][0], because that's when all possible cards are used. Wait, no. Because if you have s=5, m=3, and after processing 3 players, you have r=0. Then the sum of t_i is 5. But maybe you could have used 5 cards, but the sum of h[t_i] is higher. For example, in the previous case, sum t_i is 5 (3+2+0, but h is 7+6+0=13 vs 2+2+1=5, sum h=6+6+2=14). So in the first case, sum is 5 cards, but the total is 13. In the second case, sum is 5 cards, and the total is 14. So the DP needs to track all possible r values and find the maximum sum where sum(t_i) <= s. Because the total sum of t_i can be up to s, but the h values may make it better to use fewer cards but get a higher sum.

Wait, but how? Because the cards not used in this group's allocation are not part of any other group. Because each group is for a different favorite. So those unused cards are just given to other players as non-favorite cards, which do not contribute to any joy. So the optimal strategy for a group is to use as many of their favorite cards as possible, but in a way that maximizes the sum of h[t_i]. But the unused favorite cards can't be used by anyone else, so they are effectively wasted. Therefore, for a group, the optimal sum is the maximum possible sum of h[t_i] with sum(t_i) <= s. However, since the h array is increasing, perhaps the best way is to use as many cards as possible. But the earlier example shows that it's possible to get a higher sum by using all s cards but in a way that gives a higher sum. For instance, in that example, using 5 cards (sum t_i=5) with sum h=14. So even though all cards are used, but the way they are split gives a higher sum.

Wait, that's impossible. Because in that case, sum t_i would be 5. But in the example I made earlier, h is [2,6,7]. So for t_i=3, 2, 0: sum is 7+6+0=13, sum t_i=5. For t_i=2,2,1: sum is 6+6+2=14, sum t_i=5. So in both cases, all 5 cards are used. So the DP must choose the best possible way to split the s cards (sum t_i = s) to get maximum sum. So the problem is to split exactly s cards (if possible) in the best way. But if s is larger than m *k, then sum t_i can't exceed m*k, so the maximum sum is when each player takes k cards. So sum t_i is m*k. But in that case, we can't use all s cards (since m*k < s). Wait, but the s is the total number of cards available for the group. So sum(t_i) can't exceed s. But if s >= m*k, then each player can take k cards (sum t_i = m*k), and the remaining (s - m*k) cards are unused. But those are their favorite cards, but they can't be used. So in this case, the maximum sum is m * h[k], since each player takes k cards.

But how to model this in the DP. The DP approach would track for each player, how many cards are used so far, and the maximum sum. The DP state would be the number of players processed and the remaining cards. For each step, we can choose to take 0, 1, ..., up to min(k, remaining) cards for the current player. For each possibility, we track the maximum sum.

The time complexity for each group would be O(m * s * k). Since m can be up to 500 (n is up to 500), and s can be up to 500*10=5000 (since each player can have up to 10 cards, and there are 500 players), the per-group time is 500 * 5000 * 10 = 25,000,000. But considering that n can be 500, but groups are formed by the frequency of favorite numbers. For example, if all players have the same favorite, then m=500, and s could be up to 500*10=5000. Then, the DP for that group would take 500 *5000 *10 = 25 million operations. But 500 groups (if all players have distinct favorites) would each have m=1, but s could vary. For m=1, the time is 1 * s *k. But s can be up to 500 *10 = 5000, so 1*5000*10=50,000 per group. For 500 groups, this would be 25 million.

So overall, the total DP steps could be around 50 million. Which is acceptable for Python in 2 seconds? Not sure. But perhaps with optimizations, it could work.

But let's think: for each group, the maximum possible s is the count of c_i equal to that group's favorite. Since the total number of cards is k*n, which for n=500 and k=10 is 5000. So s can be up to 5000. But each group's s is up to 5000, and m is up to 500 (if all players in the group have the same favorite). So for a group with m=500 and s=5000, the DP would be 500 * 5000 *10 = 25 million steps. For a single group. But if there are multiple such groups, this could be a problem.

Wait, but n is up to 500. So the sum of m over all groups is exactly n. Because each player is in exactly one group (their favorite). So the sum of m across all groups is n, which is 500. So the total DP steps across all groups is sum over all groups (m_i * s_i * k). Since s_i can be up to 5000 for a group with m_i=500, but for other groups, s_i may be smaller.

The worst-case scenario is when all players have the same favorite, and s_i is 5000. So the total steps are 500 * 5000 *10 = 25,000,000. For Python, 25 million steps are manageable within 2 seconds. Because in Python, each step is a simple loop iteration and a few arithmetic operations, but 25 million steps would take roughly 2-5 seconds. Hmm. That's a problem.

So perhaps we can find a better way. Since h is strictly increasing, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. For example, for each player, the optimal t is to take as much as possible. But in the example I thought of earlier, this approach didn't work. So why?

Let me re-examine the example.

Suppose h is [2,6,7], k=3. So h_1=2, h_2=6, h_3=7.

If we have s=5, m=3 players. Then the maximum sum is achieved by t_i =2,2,1. Sum is 6+6+2=14. But if the greedy approach (each player takes as much as possible) would assign 3,2,0. Sum is 7+6+0=13.

So the greedy approach is not optimal in this case. So how can that be?

Because h_3 (7) is higher than h_2 (6), but when you take 3 for the first player, you leave 2 for the second, which gives 6. But the third gets 0, which gives 0. So the sum is 7+6=13. But if you take 2 for the first two players (sum 4), leaves 1 for the third. So 6+6+2=14. Which is better. So the initial approach of taking the maximum possible t for each player in sequence isn't optimal.

So the problem requires a dynamic programming approach to track all possibilities.

But given that m can be up to 500 and s up to 5000, the DP is O(m*s*k) which is manageable?

But in Python, loops are slow, so perhaps 25 million operations are possible. Let's see: 25 million steps, each step being a few operations. But Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second? Or maybe 1e6 per second. Wait, no. Python is slower. Let's see: a for loop with 1e8 iterations would take about 10 seconds. So 25 million steps would take about 0.25 seconds. So maybe it's manageable.

But perhaps the per-group DP can be optimized.

Alternative approach: precompute for each possible t (0 to k) the h values, and model the problem as a knapsack where each player can choose t from 0 to k (but with the sum of t <= s), and the total sum of h[t] is maximized. But since the players are independent except for the sum constraint, this is a classic unbounded knapsack problem but with a twist. Wait, but each player can be considered as an item that can take any of the possible t values (0 to k), contributing h[t], and consuming t units of capacity. The problem is to select exactly m items (players) such that the total capacity (sum of t) is <= s, and the sum is maximized. But since each item (player) is exactly one, this is a multi-dimensional knapsack problem.

But the standard approach for this is the DP we thought of before: dp[i][r] = maximum sum after i players and r remaining capacity.

So the DP approach is necessary.

Now, the steps to implement:

1. Read n and k.

2. Read the list of c_i (k*n elements).

3. Read the list of f_j (n elements).

4. Read h_1 to h_k (k elements). Note that h_0 is 0, which is for t=0.

5. For each player's favorite f_j, count how many times f_j appears in the c list. Also, count how many players have each favorite. For example, create a frequency dictionary for the c list, then for each f in the f_j list, track the count of f in c and the number of players with that f.

Wait, but the players' favorites are in f_j. So for each player, their favorite is f_j, and the number of cards with that f is count_c[f_j]. So for all players with favorite f, the maximum number of cards they can use from count_c[f] is min(t_i, count_c[f] for the group).

So the steps are:

- Count the frequency of each number in c. Let's call this cnt_c.

- Then, create a frequency dictionary for the players' favorites. For example, for each f in f_j list, count how many players have that favorite. Let's call this cnt_f.

- Then, for each f in cnt_f, we have m = cnt_f[f] (number of players with favorite f), and s = cnt_c.get(f, 0) (number of cards of f available).

For each such (m, s) pair, compute the maximum possible sum for the group. Sum these over all groups to get the total.

So, the code steps:

- Use a Counter for c and for f.

Then, for each f in the f_j list's unique elements:

   m = number of players with favorite f.

   s = number of cards in c with value f.

   compute the max sum for this group (m, s) using the DP approach.

Now, the DP for each group (m, s) is:

Initialize a 2D array, or two 1D arrays (current and next) to track the DP states.

But since m can be up to 500, and s up to 5000, a 2D array for DP[i][r] would require 500*5000 = 2.5e6 entries per group. For multiple groups, but with the sum of m across groups being 500, the total is manageable.

But in Python, using a list of lists for each group's DP could be memory-heavy. So perhaps using a 1D array and updating it in place for each player is better.

So, for each group (m, s):

Initialize a dp array of size s+1, where dp[r] represents the maximum sum possible after processing i players and having r cards remaining.

Initially, for 0 players, the remaining cards is s. So dp starts as [ -infinity ... ] except dp[s] = 0.

Wait, no. The initial state is that after 0 players, the remaining cards is s, and sum is 0.

So initial dp array is:

dp = [-infinity] * (s + 1)

dp[s] = 0

Then, for each player in 1..m:

   new_dp = [-infinity] * (s + 1)

   for r in 0 ... s:

       if dp[r] is -infinity:

           continue

       for t in 0 ... min(k, r):

           new_r = r - t

           if new_r >=0:

               if new_dp[new_r] < dp[r] + h[t] (h[0] is 0, but h is given as h_1 to h_k. So for t=0, h is 0. For t >=1, h is h_{t}.)

               So, for t in 0 to min(k, r):

                   current_h = 0 if t ==0 else h[t-1]

                   (since h is given as h_1, h_2, ..., h_k, which correspond to t=1, t=2, ..., t=k.)

So, for example, if a player takes t=2 cards, then their contribution is h_2 (since h is 1-based in the input). Wait, the input's fourth line is h_1, h_2, ..., h_k. So for t=1, the contribution is h_1. For t=2, it's h_2, etc. For t=0, it's 0.

So, for t in 0 ... min(k, r):

   if t ==0:

       add 0

   else:

       add h[t-1]

So, for each player, iterate through possible t (0 to min(k, r)), compute new_r = r - t, and update new_dp[new_r] with the maximum between its current value and dp[r] + h[t_val].

After processing all players, the maximum value in new_dp is the maximum sum for this group.

Wait, but after processing all m players, the remaining cards can be any value >=0. However, the sum of t_i is (s - remaining), but since the group's cards are s, the sum of t_i can't exceed s. So the maximum possible sum is the maximum of new_dp[r] for all r >=0. Because even if some cards are left, but the sum of h is higher.

But the problem allows using up to s cards. So the optimal sum is the maximum possible sum of h[t_i], regardless of how many cards are used, as long as sum(t_i) <=s.

So the DP for the group is correct.

Now, the code.

Implementing this in Python:

For each group (m, s):

   if s ==0:

       all players get 0, so sum += 0. So skip.

   else:

       compute DP.

But for s=0, the sum for this group is 0.

So for each group:

   if s ==0:

       continue (no contribution)

   else:

       compute the maximum sum for m players and s cards.

So, for the code:

Read n, k.

Testing against sample input 1.

Sample Input 1:

4 3

1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2

1 2 2 5

2 6 7

The favorites are [1,2,2,5]. So cnt_f is:

1:1, 2:2, 5:1.

cnt_c for each f:

1:1 (count of 1 in cards is 1)

2: in the cards, let's see:

cards are 1,3,2,8,5,5,8,2,2,8,5,2.

So 2 appears 4 times (indices 2, 7, 8, 11).

So for f=2, s=4.

For f=5: in cards, 5 appears 3 times (indices 4,5, 10).

Wait, the cards list is [1,3,2,8,5,5,8,2,2,8,5,2]. Let's count:

Looking for each number:

1:1

3:1

2:4 (positions 2,7,8,11)

8:3 (positions 3,6,9)

5:3 (positions 4,5,10)

So for f=1: cnt_c is 1, m=1. s=1.

So group 1: m=1, s=1.

The DP steps:

Initialize dp_prev = [ -inf, ... ] except s=1: dp_prev[1] =0.

For the first (and only) player:

Process each r in 0..1.

Initially, dp_prev is [ -inf, 0 ].

For each possible t (0 to min(3, r)):

When r=1, possible t is 0,1.

t=0: new_r =1-0=1 â†’ current_h=0. dp_next[1] becomes 0+0=0.

t=1: new_r=0. current_h = h[0] =2. dp_next[0] =0+2=2.

So after processing this player, the dp_next for r=0 is 2, r=1 is 0.

The max between 2 and 0 is 2. So this group contributes 2.

For group f=2: m=2 players, s=4 cards.

h is [2,6,7].

So possible t for each player is 0-3.

The DP steps:

Initial s=4. For two players.

First player:

dp_prev starts as [ -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, 0 ]

For each possible r in 0-4 where dp_prev[r] is not -inf: r=4.

Then, t can be 0-3 (since r=4, min(3,4)=3). So t can be 0,1,2,3.

For each t:

t=0 â†’ new_r=4. current_h 0. dp_next[4] =0.

t=1 â†’ new_r=3. current_h 2. dp_next[3] =2.

t=2 â†’ new_r=2. current_h 6. dp_next[2] =6.

t=3 â†’ new_r=1. current_h7. dp_next[1] =7.

So after first player, dp_prev is [ -, -, -, 2, 6, 7, ... ].

Wait, no. After first player, the new_dp is for each possible new_r. So for the first player, the initial dp_prev is [ -inf, ... ] except r=4 is 0.

Processing the first player:

new_dp is initialized to all -inf.

For r=4, and possible t from 0 to 3.

t=0: new_r=4 â†’ current_h=0. new_dp[4] =0.

t=1: new_r=3 â†’ current_h=2. new_dp[3] =2.

t=2: new_r=2 â†’ current_h=6. new_dp[2] =6.

t=3: new_r=1 â†’ current_h=7. new_dp[1] =7.

So after the first player, dp_prev becomes new_dp, which has entries at 4,3,2,1.

Now, processing the second player (m=2):

For each r in 0-4:

We need to process each r where dp_prev[r] is not -inf.

These are r=4 (0), r=3 (2), r=2 (6), r=1 (7).

For each of these r values, and possible t from 0 to min(3, r).

Let's process each:

Case 1: r=4.

t can be 0,1,2,3.

t=0: new_r=4. Add 0 â†’ 0 +0=0. new_dp[4] is max between -inf and 0 â†’ 0.

t=1: new_r=3. Add 2 â†’ 0+2=2. new_dp[3] becomes 2.

t=2: new_r=2 â†’ 0+6=6. new_dp[2] becomes6.

t=3: new_r=1 â†’0+7=7. new_dp[1] becomes7.

Case 2: r=3 (current dp_prev[r] is 2).

t can be up to 3 (since r=3).

t=0: new_r=3 â†’ 2+0=2. new_dp[3] is max(2, 2) â†’ 2.

t=1: new_r=2 â†’2+2=4. new_dp[2] is max(6,4) â†’6 remains.

t=2: new_r=1 â†’2+6=8. new_dp[1] is max(7, 8) â†’8.

t=3: new_r=0 â†’2+7=9. new_dp[0] is9.

Case3: r=2 (dp_prev[r] is6).

t can be 0-2.

t=0 â†’ new_r=2 â†’6+0=6. new_dp[2] remains6.

t=1 â†’ new_r=1 â†’6+2=8. new_dp[1] is max(8, 8) â†’8.

t=2 â†’ new_r=0 â†’6+6=12. new_dp[0] is max(9, 12) â†’12.

Case4: r=1 (dp_prev[r] is7).

t can be 0-1.

t=0: new_r=1 â†’7+0=7. new_dp[1] is max(8,7) â†’8.

t=1: new_r=0 â†’7+2=9. new_dp[0] is max(12,9) â†’12.

So after processing the second player, the new_dp has:

At r=4: 0.

At r=3:2.

At r=2:6.

At r=1:8.

At r=0:12.

So the maximum in new_dp is12.

So this group contributes12.

For group f=5: m=1 player, s=3 cards.

DP steps:

Initial s=3.

After one player:

t can be up to 3.

r=3.

t=0 â†’0.

t=1 â†’h[0] =2.

t=2 â†’h[1] =6.

t=3 â†’h[2] =7.

So new_r after each t:

t=3: new_r=0 â†’7.

So the max is7.

So this group contributes7.

Total sum: 2 (group 1) +12 (group2) +7 (group5) =21. Which matches the sample output.

So the code works for the first example.

The second example:

Input:

3 3

9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9

1 2 3

1 2 3

Each player's favorite is 1,2,3. But the cards are all 9. So for each group, s=0. So no contribution. Total sum is 0.

So code returns 0.

Another test case.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python, with careful handling of the groups, and the DP.

The code:

Read n and k.

cards = list of c_i.

favorites = list of f_j.

h = list.

cnt_c = Counter(cards).

cnt_f = Counter(favorites).

total =0.

For each f in cnt_f:

   m = cnt_f[f]

   s = cnt_c.get(f, 0)

   if s ==0: continue.

   process DP.

   add max_group to total.

Print(total).

But in Python, using a list for dp_prev and dp_next.

But for each group, s can be up to 5000, so the list is manageable.

Now, implementing this.

But the code needs to be efficient. For the DP steps, using loops and avoiding unnecessary steps.

But for the code as written, it should work.

Now, the code:

Read the inputs.

from collections import Counter.

Then process each group.

Now, code:

But wait, in the code for the DP, when s is 0, the group is skipped. Otherwise, proceed.

But what about when s is zero for a group? For example, if the favorite is 5 and there are no 5's in the cards. Then, all players in that group will get 0, so their contribution is 0. So the code skips adding anything, which is correct.

Another point: h is given as h_1 to h_k. So for t=1, we use h[0], etc. So the code uses h[t-1] when t>0.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.
