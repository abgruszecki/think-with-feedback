Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to count the number of valid sets in a tree. The valid sets must be non-empty, connected, and the difference between the maximum and minimum a_i in the set should be <= d. Oh right, and the answer has to be modulo 1e9+7.

First, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. The constraints are n up to 2000, which suggests that an O(n^2) solution might be feasible, but anything higher could be problematic. Let's think.

The key points here are the connected subsets of the tree. For each possible subset that's connected, we need to check if the max and min a_i in it differ by at most d. But checking all possible connected subsets is impossible because there are exponentially many. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, maybe we can model this by fixing a root node as the one with the minimum (or maximum) value in the subset. Then, for each node, consider it as the minimum in the subset and find all connected subsets that include it and have max a_i - a_i <= d. Similarly, but avoiding double-counting. Wait, but how to handle that. Alternatively, perhaps we can fix the minimum and maximum values and count the subsets that fit within those bounds.

Another approach: For each node u, consider all possible subsets where u is the node with the minimum a_i in the subset. Then, the maximum a_i in the subset can be up to a_u + d. Then, the problem is to count all connected subsets that include u, have a_i >= a_u, and all a_i <= a_u + d, with u being the minimal node (so no node in the subset has a value less than a_u). But how to count these subsets.

Alternatively, since the subset must form a connected subtree. So for each node u, we can consider all subsets where u is the node with the minimum value. Then, we can traverse the tree in a way that includes nodes with a_i >= a_u and a_i <= a_u + d, and ensure that the subset is connected.

Wait, but how to avoid overlapping counts. For example, a subset might have multiple nodes with the same minimum value. But if we fix the minimum value as the a_u of node u, then we can process each node u, and count the number of connected subsets where the minimum is exactly a_u. Then, the total is the sum over all u of the number of such subsets. But how to ensure that the minimum is exactly a_u, i.e., that no other node in the subset has a value less than a_u.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix the minimal node in the subset and then count all connected subsets that include it and where all other nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u and a_i <= a_u + d. But this would count subsets where the minimal node is u, which is exactly what we need. Because if there's another node in the subset with a_i equal to a_u, it's allowed as long as the maximum doesn't exceed a_u +d.

So for each node u, we can compute the number of connected subsets where:

- The subset includes u.

- All nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u.

- The maximum a_i in the subset <= a_u +d.

Then, sum all these for all u. But wait, this would count subsets where the minimal a_i is a_u, but there might be other nodes with a_i equal to a_u, but as long as the max is a_u +d <= a_u +d, which it is. Wait, but the minimal is a_u, but other nodes in the subset can have a_i >= a_u, which is okay.

But how to compute that. Because for each node u, the connected subsets that include u, and all nodes in the subset have a_i in [a_u, a_u +d]. Also, the subset can't have any node with a_i < a_u. So the approach is:

For each node u, we need to find all connected subsets that include u, where all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d. Additionally, the subset must be connected.

But this may count subsets where the minimal a_i is higher than a_u. For example, if u's a_u is 2, and another node v in the subset has a_v=3, and d is 1. Then the subset's min is 2 and max is 3, which is allowed. But if u's a_u is 2, and there's another node in the subset with a_i=2, then the min is still 2.

Wait, but in this approach, when we process node u, we are considering subsets where u is part of the subset, and all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u and a_i <= a_u +d. However, the subset might include other nodes with a_i less than a_u if they are in the subtree. Wait, no. Because the condition is that all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u. Wait, no. Wait, when we process node u, the condition for this particular u is that all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u. So when we process u, any node in the subset must have a_i >= a_u. So in this case, the minimal node in the subset is u's a_u, but there may be other nodes with a_i equal to a_u. So this approach would count all subsets where the minimal a_i is a_u, and the max is <= a_u +d. Because if there was a node in the subset with a_i < a_u, then a_i >= a_u would not hold, so that subset is excluded.

Wait, but when we process u, the subsets that are counted are those where all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u. So the minimal a_i in the subset is a_u. Because u is in the subset, and u's a_i is the minimal in the subset. Therefore, the max a_i of the subset must be <= a_u +d. So the approach is correct. Therefore, by iterating over all nodes u, and for each u, counting the number of connected subsets that include u, consist of nodes with a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d, and are connected. Then, the sum over all u gives the total valid subsets, but wait, perhaps there is overlapping. Because a subset could have multiple nodes with a_i as the minimal. For example, if two nodes u and v have the same a_i, then the subset containing both may be counted once when processing u and once when processing v. So this would overcount.

Ah, right. That's a problem. Because when you process u and v (with the same a_i), the same subset would be counted in both. So we need a way to count each valid subset exactly once. How?

Hmm, this is a critical point. So the initial approach would overcount subsets where the minimal a_i occurs in multiple nodes (like two nodes with the same a_i). For example, if a subset has two nodes u and v with a_u = a_v = x, then when processing u, the subset is considered as part of the subsets where the min is x (and u is part of the subset). When processing v, the same subset is considered again, leading to duplicate counts.

So this approach would count the same subset multiple times if there are multiple nodes with the same a_i as the minimal in the subset. Therefore, this approach is not correct. So we need a way to count each subset exactly once.

So perhaps we need to find a way to count subsets where the minimal a_i is exactly the a_u of the chosen node u, and u is the "smallest" possible in some order, such as the one with the smallest index. Wait, but that's complicated.

Alternative idea: For each subset S that satisfies the conditions, let the minimal a_i in S be m. Then, the subset is counted exactly once for the node u which is the minimal node (in terms of index) among all nodes in S with a_i = m. Wait, but that's not necessarily straightforward. Maybe we can process the nodes in a certain order, such that when we process u, we only count subsets where u is the minimal node (in terms of a_i) and all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u, but also that for all nodes v in the subset with a_v = a_u, u is the one with the smallest index. Then, each subset is counted exactly once. But how to enforce this in the algorithm.

Alternatively, we can process the nodes in the order of increasing a_i. Then, for each node u, when processing it, we consider subsets where u is the minimal node (since all nodes processed before u have higher a_i and thus can't be part of the subset if the subset's minimal is u). Wait, no. Wait, if nodes are processed in order of increasing a_i, then when processing u, all nodes with a_i < a_u have already been processed. So when considering subsets where u is the minimal, the other nodes in the subset must have a_i >= a_u. So for u, the subsets that are counted are those that include u, and all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d, and the subset is connected. Also, since any node in the subset with a_i < a_u would have been processed earlier, but they are not part of the subset (since we are considering u as the minimal). Therefore, when processing u, we can count all connected subsets that include u, consist of nodes with a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d, and ensure that u is the first node (in processing order) with a_i equal to the minimal of the subset. How?

Alternatively, perhaps when processing nodes in increasing order of a_i, for each u, the subsets counted for u are exactly those where the minimal a_i is a_u. Because any node in the subset with a_i < a_u would have been processed before u, but when processing u, those nodes are not allowed to be in the subset (since the subsets considered for u have a_i >= a_u). Therefore, the subset's minimal a_i is exactly a_u. Thus, by processing nodes in increasing order of a_i, and for each u, counting the number of connected subsets that include u, consist of nodes with a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d, and connected, we can ensure that each subset is counted exactly once, as the minimal node in the subset is processed first and only counted once.

Yes! That's the key insight. Let me explain again. Suppose we process the nodes in order of a_i from smallest to largest. For each node u, when we process it, we consider all subsets that include u, where all nodes in the subset have a_i >= a_u and <= a_u +d, and the subset is connected. Since u is the first node processed (because a_u is the smallest so far), any subset that includes u and has a_i >= a_u will have their minimal a_i exactly equal to a_u, because any node in the subset with a_i < a_u would have been processed before u and thus not considered. Therefore, in this approach, each subset is counted exactly once, when u is the minimal a_i in the subset and u is the first such node in the processing order. But wait, the processing order is by a_i. So if there are multiple nodes with the same a_i, how are they ordered? For example, if two nodes u and v have the same a_i, then whichever comes first in the processing order (say, u) will be the one to count the subsets where both are part of the subset. Because when processing u, the a_i of u and v are equal, so v's a_i >= a_u (since they are equal), and so v can be part of the subset. But when processing v, the subsets where u is included (with a_i = a_v) would have a_i >= a_v (since u's a_i is equal to a_v), but u has a smaller a_i than a_v (no, they are equal). Wait, no. If u and v have the same a_i, then when processing u (assuming u is processed first), the subsets that include u and v (and others) would be counted under u's processing. Then, when processing v, the same subsets would not be counted, because the a_i of v is equal to a_v (since they are the same as u's a_i), but when processing v, the condition is a_i >= a_v. But since u's a_i is equal to a_v, u can be part of the subset when processing v. However, in this case, since u has a_i equal to a_v, which is the same as the current node v's a_i, and u was processed earlier (since we process nodes in order of a_i, and then perhaps by index if a_i is same), then during processing u, the subset was counted. When processing v, the subset that includes both u and v would also be allowed (since a_i >= a_v's a_i is same as u's a_i). So this would lead to double-counting.

Ah, right. So the problem arises when multiple nodes have the same a_i. How to handle that?

Ah, the problem is that when a_i is the same, processing u and then v would allow their overlapping subsets. So the approach of processing nodes in order of a_i and then for each u, counting subsets where all nodes have a_i >= a_u and max a_i <= a_u +d would count some subsets multiple times if the a_i of multiple nodes are the same.

So to avoid that, perhaps we should process nodes in order of increasing a_i, and within the same a_i, process them in order of increasing node index. Then, for a subset S where the minimal a_i is x, the node u in S with the minimal index among all nodes in S with a_i = x would be the one that "covers" the subset. Then, when processing u, the subset S is counted. When processing other nodes v in S with a_i =x but higher index, they are processed after u, so when processing v, the subset S is not counted again because during the processing of v, the nodes with a_i < a_v (including u, which is processed before v and has a_i = a_v) are not allowed. Wait, but during processing v, the allowed a_i's are >= a_v. But since a_u = a_v, and u is processed before v, then during processing v, u's a_i is equal to a_v. But when processing v, the subsets considered are those where all nodes have a_i >= a_v (which is same as a_u). So any subset that includes u (processed earlier) and v, but also other nodes with a_i >= a_v (which is the same as a_u), would be counted when processing u and v. So this would lead to duplicates.

So how to handle this? Maybe the problem is that when multiple nodes have the same a_i, the current approach counts the same subset multiple times. So the initial approach is wrong.

Hmm. So perhaps we need a different approach. Let's think again. For each subset S, there's exactly one node u which is the minimal a_i in S. If there are multiple nodes in S with the same a_i equal to the minimal, then u can be the one with the smallest index among them. Then, when processing u, we can count S only if all nodes in S have a_i >= a_u, and the max a_i in S is <= a_u +d, and S is connected. Also, in this approach, when processing u, any node in S with a_i equal to a_u must have an index >= u's index (since u is the first in order). So how to enforce that.

Wait, but how to process nodes in such a way that when we process u, we count all subsets S where u is the minimal a_i in S (considering both value and index), and the max in S is <= a_u +d.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to avoid duplicates is to process nodes in order of a_i, and for nodes with the same a_i, process them in order of increasing index. Then, for each u, when considering subsets S that include u, and all nodes in S have a_i >= a_u, and the max is <= a_u +d, but also that for any other node v in S with a_i == a_u, v must have an index >= u's index. Then, each subset S is counted exactly once, when processed by the first node (by index) in S with a_i equal to the minimal a_i of S.

But how to enforce that in the algorithm. It's not straightforward. So perhaps during the processing of u, when building the connected subsets, we must exclude any node v with a_i == a_u but v has a smaller index than u. Because those nodes would have been processed earlier, and their subsets would have already included this node.

Wait, but if u is processed in order, and the nodes with a_i equal to a_u but smaller index are already processed, then when processing u, if we include those nodes in the subset, their a_i is equal to a_u. But since they were processed earlier, their a_i is equal to a_u. So when processing u, any subset that includes such nodes would have a minimal a_i of a_u, but the node with the smallest index (among those with a_i equal to a_u) would have been processed earlier. Therefore, the subset would have been counted when processing that earlier node. Therefore, when processing u, we should not include any nodes with a_i == a_u and index < u. Because those nodes' processing would have already covered any subsets that include them and u.

Therefore, during the processing of u, the allowed nodes are those with a_i >= a_u and either a_i > a_u, or a_i == a_u and their index >= u. Because nodes with a_i == a_u and index < u are already processed, and any subset that includes them would have been counted during their processing.

Thus, the solution is:

1. Sort the nodes in order of increasing a_i. For nodes with the same a_i, sort them by increasing index. So the order is such that a_i is non-decreasing, and for equal a_i's, the node with smaller index comes first.

2. For each node u in this order, compute the number of connected subsets that include u, and consist of nodes v where a_v >= a_u, and a_v <= a_u +d. Additionally, for nodes v with a_v == a_u, their index must be >= u's index. This ensures that each subset is counted exactly once (under the node u which is the first in the sorted order among those with the minimal a_i in the subset).

But how to model this in the algorithm. The key is that when processing u, the allowed nodes are those with a_i >= a_u, and either a_i > a_u or (a_i == a_u and index >= u). So during the processing of u, the allowed nodes are u itself and other nodes that are allowed (based on a_i and index). Then, the problem reduces to finding all connected subsets that include u, and consist of allowed nodes, and form a connected subset.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Another idea: For each u, build a subtree where the nodes are those v where a_v is in [a_u, a_u +d], and (a_v > a_u) or (a_v == a_u and v >= u). Then, the problem is to count the number of connected subsets in this subtree that include u. The sum of all these counts over all u is the answer.

But how to compute the number of connected subsets that include a certain node. This is similar to counting all non-empty connected subsets that contain u in the subtree. But the subtree here is constrained by the allowed nodes.

But the subtree may be a part of the original tree. So perhaps for each u, we can create a filtered tree that includes u and the allowed nodes (as described), and then compute the number of connected subsets that include u in this filtered tree.

But how to compute this efficiently. The number of connected subsets that include a particular node can be computed using dynamic programming on trees. For example, for each node u, the number of subsets in its subtree can be calculated as the product of (dp[v] + 1) for all children v, where dp[v] is the number of subsets in the subtree of v that include v and are connected. Then, adding 1 for the case where we don't include the child. But this is for a rooted tree. So perhaps, for each u, we can compute the number of connected subsets that include u by treating u as the root, and considering all possible selections of its subtrees.

Wait, the standard approach for counting connected subsets in a tree that include a root node is to perform a DP where for each node, you consider whether to include its children and their connected subsets. So for a tree rooted at u, the number of subsets is the product of (1 + dp[v]) for each child v of u, where dp[v] is the number of subsets in the subtree of v that can be included (since you can choose to include any combination of the child's subsets or not, as long as the connection to u is maintained). But this gives the number of subsets that include u and are connected.

Wait, more precisely, for each node u, the number of connected subsets that include u is the product of (1 + sum of subsets for each child). Let me think. Suppose u has children v1, v2, ..., vk. Each child's subtree can contribute any subset that is connected and includes the child. But for the root u, if you include u, then each child can either be included (in which case their entire subtree's subsets that include the child can be part of the subset) or not included. So for each child v, the options are: include none of the subsets in v's subtree, or include a subset that includes v (and is connected). So for each child, the multiplier is (1 + dp[v]). The product of these multipliers gives all possible combinations. Then, the total for u is the product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children, minus 1 (because the empty subset is allowed in the product, but the root u must be included, so the empty product corresponds to only u being in the subset. So the total is the product minus 1 (if empty subsets are considered).

Wait, let's think: The root u must be included. For each child, you can choose to include none of its subsets (so the child is not part of the subset), or include a subset that includes the child (which is connected). So for each child, the contribution is 1 (not including) + dp[v] (including). So the product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children gives the total number of ways to choose subsets for each child. Since the root is included, the total is the product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children, but since the subset must be non-empty (the root is included), the product already counts that. Wait, for example, if a node has two children. For each child, you can choose to not include it (1 option) or include any of its subsets (dp[v] options). The total is (1 + dp[v1]) * (1 + dp[v2]). Each term represents the choices for each child. The root is included, and if all children are not included, then the subset is just {u}. If some children are included, then their subsets are connected to the root. So the product gives the total number of possible subsets including u and connected. Therefore, the formula is (product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children) - 1? No, wait, the product already includes the case where all children are not included. For example, if a node has no children, then the product is 1 (since no terms to multiply), so the subset is just {u}, which is one subset. So the correct formula is the product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children. So for each node u, the number of subsets that include u and are connected is the product of (1 + dp[v]) for all children, and this counts all possible combinations (including choosing no children, which gives the subset {u}).

Yes. So the approach is:

For each node u in the tree, compute the number of connected subsets that include u. This can be done via a DP approach where for each node, we compute the product of (1 + dp[v]) for each child v. The DP starts from the leaves and works up to the root.

But in our problem, for each u, we need to build a subtree consisting of nodes that are allowed (as per the conditions for u), and then compute the number of connected subsets that include u in this subtree.

So the steps would be:

1. Sort all nodes in order of increasing a_i, then by increasing index. So u comes before v if a_u < a_v, or a_u == a_v and u's index is smaller.

2. For each node u in this order, create a filtered tree where a_v is in [a_u, a_u +d], and if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index. Then, the nodes in this filtered tree form a subtree (since the original tree is connected). Wait, no. The filtered tree may consist of multiple disconnected parts, but the original tree is connected. However, if some nodes are excluded, the remaining nodes may form multiple disconnected components. So u's allowed nodes are those that meet the a_i and index conditions, and are connected to u. Because the subset must include u and be connected.

Ah right. So the allowed nodes for u are those nodes v that:

- a_v >= a_u

- a_v <= a_u +d

- if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index.

Additionally, the subset must form a connected component that includes u. So when building the allowed nodes, we need to find all nodes that are connected to u via nodes that are allowed. So this requires a traversal from u, including only allowed nodes.

Therefore, for each u, the allowed nodes are those that are in the allowed a_i and index ranges and can be reached from u via edges that only go through allowed nodes.

So for each u, we need to build the connected component that includes u, and all nodes in this component satisfy the a_i and index conditions.

Once we have this component (a subtree), the number of connected subsets that include u in this component is computed using the DP approach mentioned earlier.

But how to build this subtree efficiently. For each u, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from u, traversing only the allowed nodes (as per the conditions). Then, the nodes visited form the subtree for u.

Once we have this subtree, the DP can be computed.

But considering that n is up to 2000, and for each u, this process could take O(n) time, the total time complexity would be O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=2000.

But how to manage the DP for each subtree.

Wait, the DP approach for counting subsets is a standard tree DP. For a tree, the number of connected subsets that include the root is the product of (1 + dp[child]) for each child. So for each node's subtree (after filtering), we can compute this product.

But when building the subtree for u, the allowed nodes form a tree (since the original tree is a tree, and the allowed nodes form a connected component that includes u). Wait, no. The original tree is connected, but when we filter nodes, the allowed nodes may form a connected subtree. Because when you traverse from u, and include all allowed nodes that are reachable via allowed edges, the result is a connected subtree.

Therefore, the subtree for u is a tree, and we can perform the DP on it.

So the steps for the solution are:

For each u in sorted order (by a_i and index):

1. Check if a_u +d is >= a_u (obviously, since d is non-negative). So the a_i condition is a_v >= a_u and a_v <= a_u +d.

2. For this u, build the allowed subtree starting from u, including nodes v that satisfy:

   a. a_v >= a_u

   b. a_v <= a_u +d

   c. if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index.

   Additionally, the nodes must be reachable from u via nodes that also meet these conditions.

3. Once this subtree is built, compute the number of connected subsets that include u. This is the product of (1 + dp[child]) for each child of u in the subtree. The product is calculated via a post-order traversal, where for each node in the subtree, we compute the product of (1 + sum of children's dp values). Wait, more precisely:

For each node in the allowed subtree, when processing it, we compute the number of connected subsets that include this node. For each child in the allowed subtree, the number of subsets is (1 + child's value), since the child can be included (adding its subsets) or not. The product across all children gives the total. So for the root u, the value is the product of (1 + child_value) for all children in the allowed subtree, minus 1? No, the product includes the case where no children are included (which gives the subset {u}), which is allowed.

Wait, for the root u, the number of subsets is the product of (1 + child_value) for each child. Because for each child, you can choose to include none of its subsets (1 option) or any of its subsets (child_value options). The product gives all possible combinations, including the subset {u} (all children not included). So for the root u, the total is the product of (1 + child_value) for all children. But since the subset must be non-empty, this product is correct. So for example, if a node has two children, and each child has 0 subsets (because their a_i is not allowed), then the product is 1*1 = 1, which is the subset {u}.

Thus, the DP for the subtree is as follows:

- For each node in the allowed subtree, during a post-order traversal, compute the product of (1 + child's DP value) for all children in the allowed subtree.

Thus, the root u's DP value is exactly the number of connected subsets that include u and are part of the allowed subtree.

So, for each u, we need to compute the number of connected subsets in the allowed subtree that include u. The sum over all u of these numbers is the answer.

Now, the question is how to efficiently compute this for all u.

Now, considering that for each u, building the allowed subtree requires a BFS or DFS. For each u, this takes O(n) time, and the DP computation is O(n). Since there are O(n) nodes, the total time is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=2000.

But with n=2000, O(n^2) is 4 million operations, which is manageable.

But how to represent the allowed subtree for each u. We can perform a BFS/DFS each time and build a tree structure, but perhaps we can do it on the fly.

Let's outline the steps for each u:

1. Sort all nodes in order of increasing a_i, then increasing index.

2. For each u in this order:

   a. Check if a_u +d is >= a_u (always true as d >=0).

   b. Check if any node v with a_v < a_u can be in the subset. But according to the allowed conditions, no. So the allowed nodes are those with a_v >= a_u and a_v <= a_u +d, and if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index.

   c. Perform a BFS or DFS starting from u, but only visit nodes that meet the allowed conditions. During this traversal, build a parent array to represent the allowed subtree.

   d. Once the allowed subtree is built, perform a post-order traversal to compute the DP values for each node in the subtree. However, for the purpose of counting the subsets that include u, we only need the DP value of u. The other nodes' DP values are not needed once u's DP is computed.

   e. Add u's DP value to the answer.

But to compute u's DP value, we need to traverse the allowed subtree in post-order and compute the product for each node. However, since the allowed subtree is a tree, this can be done efficiently.

Alternatively, during the BFS/DFS, we can build a tree structure (like adjacency list) and compute the DP for u's subtree.

So here's a possible approach for each u:

- Initialize a visited array to mark nodes allowed for this u.

- Perform a BFS/DFS from u, adding nodes to the allowed subtree if they meet the conditions.

- For each node in the allowed subtree, build a list of children (but since the original tree is undirected, during BFS/DFS we track parents to avoid cycles).

- Once the allowed subtree is built as a tree (with parent pointers), compute the DP for u as follows:

   For each node in the allowed subtree in post-order:

      dp[node] = product of (1 + dp[child]) for all children (excluding the parent).

   The root u's dp value is the product of (1 + dp[child]) for all its children in the allowed subtree.

Thus, for u's allowed subtree, the number of subsets is dp[u], which is the product of (1 + dp[child]) for all children.

So this approach can be implemented as follows:

Implement for each u:

1. Check if a_u is such that a_u +d >= a_u (which is always true).

2. For the allowed conditions, generate the allowed subtree via BFS/DFS.

3. Compute the DP for this subtree.

Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.

Let's think about the data structures. For each u, during the BFS/DFS, we can have a list of allowed nodes. Then, for each such node, we need to list their allowed children (i.e., adjacent nodes in the original tree that are allowed and not yet visited).

But in the original tree, each node's adjacency list is known. So during BFS/DFS for u:

- Start with u, check if it meets the allowed conditions (which it does).

- For each neighbor of the current node, check if the neighbor meets the allowed conditions (a_v >= a_u, a_v <= a_u +d, and if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index).

- If the neighbor is allowed and not visited, add it to the queue/stack and mark it as visited.

This way, the allowed subtree is built.

Once the allowed subtree is built, we can represent it as a tree where each node has a list of children (excluding the parent). Then, the DP can be computed in post-order.

But how to represent the children. For example, during the BFS/DFS, for each node, we can track its parent in the allowed subtree, and then for each node, collect all children (adjacent nodes in the allowed subtree that are not the parent).

Alternatively, during the BFS/DFS, for each node, collect all allowed neighbors except the parent, and treat them as children.

But perhaps the easiest way is to perform a BFS/DFS and track the parent for each node. Then, during the DP phase, for each node, iterate through all its adjacent nodes in the original tree. For each adjacent node, if it is in the allowed subtree and is not the parent, then it's a child in the allowed subtree.

But this could be time-consuming. For each node in the allowed subtree, we have to check all its original neighbors. But given that the allowed subtree is a subset of the original tree, and the original tree has n-1 edges, the total number of edges processed per u is O(n), leading to O(n^2) time overall.

But for n=2000, this is manageable.

Alternatively, during the BFS/DFS for u, for each allowed node, we can precompute a list of allowed children (nodes that are allowed and are not the parent). This can be done during the BFS/DFS. For each node, when we visit its neighbor, if the neighbor is allowed and not visited, then we can add it to the queue, and track the parent. Thus, each allowed node's children are those nodes added to the queue from it. So for each node, the children list is the list of nodes that were added to the queue via this node (i.e., their parent is this node).

Thus, during the BFS/DFS, we can build for each allowed node a list of children in the allowed subtree. Then, during the DP phase, we can process the subtree in post-order using these children lists.

So for example, when building the allowed subtree for u:

- Initialize a queue with u. Mark u as visited. u's parent is None.

- While the queue is not empty:

   - Dequeue node v.

   - For each neighbor w in v's adjacency list:

      - If w is not visited, and meets the allowed conditions (a_w >= a_u, a_w <= a_u +d, and if a_w == a_u, then w's index >= u's index):

          - Mark w as visited.

          - Enqueue w.

          - Set w's parent to v.

          - Add w to v's children list.

This way, each allowed node's children list is built during the BFS/DFS. Then, during the DP phase, for each node in the allowed subtree, we can traverse the children list to compute the product.

Once the children lists are built for the allowed subtree, the DP can be computed as follows:

Initialize a dictionary or array to hold dp values for each node in the allowed subtree. For each node in post-order (children processed before parent), compute dp[node] as the product of (1 + dp[child]) for all children in the children list.

The root u's dp value is the product of (1 + dp[child]) for all its children. Then, this value is added to the answer.

Now, putting it all together:

The algorithm steps are:

1. Read d and n.

2. Read a list of a_i's.

3. Read the n-1 edges and build an adjacency list.

4. Sort the nodes in order of increasing a_i, then increasing index.

5. For each u in this sorted list:

   a. Check if a_u +d < a_u (impossible, since d >=0). So skip this check.

   b. Perform BFS/DFS to build the allowed subtree for u:

      i. Allowed nodes are those with a_v >= a_u, a_v <= a_u +d, and if a_v == a_u, then v's index >= u's index.

      ii. For each node in this allowed subtree, track parent and children.

   c. Compute the DP for the allowed subtree in post-order to find the number of subsets that include u and are connected.

   d. Add this number to the answer.

6. Output the answer modulo 1e9+7.

Now, the next question is how to efficiently implement the BFS/DFS and the DP for each u.

Implementing the BFS:

For each u:

- Create a visited array (could be a list of booleans) of size n+1 (since nodes are 1-based), initialized to False.

- Initialize a queue with u. Mark visited[u] = True.

- For each node in the queue, iterate over its neighbors. For each neighbor w:

   - Check if a_w >= a_u and a_w <= a_u +d.

   - If a_w == a_u, check if w's index >= u's index.

   - If these conditions are met and not visited, add to the queue, mark as visited, and set parent.

   - Record the children for each node.

Once the allowed subtree is built, perform a post-order traversal. For example, using recursion or a stack. For each node, compute the product of (1 + dp[child]).

But for large n, recursion might hit stack limits, so an iterative post-order traversal is better.

But since the allowed subtree for each u can be up to n nodes (but in practice, smaller), it's manageable.

So the code outline is:

answer = 0

sorted_nodes = sorted(enumerate(a), key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]+1))  # since nodes are 1-based? Or wait, wait. Let's see. Wait, the nodes are 1-based in the input. For example, in the first sample, the nodes are 1, 2, 3, 4. So when we process the nodes, the index is 1-based.

Wait, in the problem statement, the nodes are 1-based. So when we sort the nodes, for each node u (1-based), the a_u is given, and the index is u (1-based). So when sorting by a_i and then by index, the index is the 1-based index.

So sorted_nodes should be a list of (u, a_u) tuples sorted by a_u, then by u.

Yes.

So for each u in sorted order:

   allowed_nodes = BFS/DFS from u, collecting all nodes that meet the conditions.

   build children lists for each node in allowed_nodes.

   compute dp[u] via post-order traversal:

      dp = { node: 1 for node in allowed_nodes }

      for each node in post-order:

          product = 1

          for child in children[node]:

              product *= (1 + dp[child])

          dp[node] = product

      answer += dp[u]

   answer %= MOD

Wait, but the post-order needs to process children first. So for each node in the allowed subtree, after processing all children, compute the product.

So the code would need to process the nodes in reverse order of their discovery (post-order).

An alternative is to use a stack to track nodes and their visited status. For example, during iterative post-order traversal:

stack = [(u, False)]

while stack:

    node, visited = stack.pop()

    if visited:

        product = 1

        for child in children[node]:

            product = (product * (1 + dp[child])) % MOD

        dp[node] = product

    else:

        stack.append( (node, True) )

        for child in reversed(children[node]):

            stack.append( (child, False) )

But since the children list for each node is built during the BFS/DFS, this should work.

Once the DP is computed, the root u's DP value is added to the answer.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But first, how to represent the adjacency list. The adjacency list can be a list of lists, where adj[u] contains all adjacent nodes of u.

But since the tree is undirected, during BFS/DFS, we have to avoid revisiting the parent.

So for each u:

   visited = [False] * (n+1)

   parent = [0]*(n+1)

   children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

   queue = deque([u])

   visited[u] = True

   while queue:

       v = queue.popleft()

       for w in adj[v]:

           if not visited[w] and (a[w-1] >= a_u and a[w-1] <= a_u + d):

               # check if a[w-1] == a_u and w >= u (since u is 1-based)

               if a[w-1] == a_u and w < u:

                   continue  # skip this node

               # else, allow

               visited[w] = True

               parent[w] = v

               children[v].append(w)

               queue.append(w)

   # Now, children lists are built for the allowed subtree

   # Then, compute DP via post-order traversal

   dp = {}

   stack = [(u, False)]

   while stack:

       node, done = stack.pop()

       if not done:

           stack.append( (node, True) )

           for child in reversed(children[node]):

               stack.append( (child, False) )

       else:

           res = 1

           for child in children[node]:

               res = (res * (1 + dp[child])) % MOD

           dp[node] = res

   answer = (answer + dp[u]) % MOD

But in Python, the adjacency list is 1-based. Also, the a list is given as 0-based in the input. For example, in the first sample input:

The second line is 2 1 3 2, which are the a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4.

So for node u (1-based), a[u-1] is the value.

In the code above, a_u is a[u-1] (since u is 1-based).

So during BFS/DFS:

For a node v (1-based), a[v-1] is its a_i.

The conditions are:

a[v-1] >= a_u (which is a[u-1])

a[v-1] <= a[u-1] + d

and if a[v-1] == a[u-1], then v >= u (since u is processed in sorted order, and other nodes with a_i = a_u must have index >= u's index to be allowed).

Thus, during the BFS/DFS for u, when processing neighbor w:

if a[w-1] == a_u_val (a[u-1]), then w must be >= u.

Thus, the code for checking the conditions is:

a_u_val = a[u-1]

if (a[w-1] >= a_u_val) and (a[w-1] <= a_u_val + d):

    if a[w-1] == a_u_val and w < u:

        continue  # disallow

    else:

        # allow

But this is only after the other conditions are met.

Wait, the code should check:

if (a[w-1] >= a_u_val) and (a[w-1] <= a_u_val + d):

    if (a[w-1] == a_u_val) and (w < u):

        continue  # not allowed

    else:

        if not visited[w]:

            # process

But wait, this is not correct. Because the a[w-1] must be >= a_u_val, which is true here. But when a[w-1] is equal to a_u_val, the node w must have index >= u.

So the code is:

if a[w-1] < a_u_val:

    skip (condition not met)

elif a[w-1] > a_u_val + d:

    skip

else:

    if a[w-1] == a_u_val and w < u:

        skip

    else:

        allow

But in code, for the neighbor w:

if (a[w-1] >= a_u_val and a[w-1] <= a_u_val +d):

    if (a[w-1] == a_u_val) and (w < u):

        continue

    else:

        if not visited[w]:

            process w

But code can be written as:

allowed = (a[w-1] >= a_u_val) and (a[w-1] <= a_u_val + d) and not (a[w-1] == a_u_val and w < u)

if allowed and not visited[w]:

    process

Thus, in code:

for each neighbor w of v:

    if a[w-1] < a_u_val or a[w-1] > a_u_val + d:

        continue

    if a[w-1] == a_u_val and w < u:

        continue

    if not visited[w]:

        add to queue, etc.

Now, putting this all together.

But in Python, for each u, the code needs to perform these steps.

Another optimization: since the nodes are processed in sorted order (increasing a_i and then index), when a node u is processed, any node v with a[v-1] < a[u-1] has already been processed, and their allowed subtree would not include u. So during u's processing, the allowed nodes are those with a_i >= a[u-1], and other conditions.

But this is handled automatically by the BFS/DFS.

Now, testing this approach against the sample input.

Sample input 1:

1 4

2 1 3 2

Edges:

1-2, 1-3, 3-4.

The sorted nodes would be sorted by a_i and then index. The a values are:

node 1: 2

node 2:1

node 3:3

node4:2

But wait, no. Wait, the a list is given as 2 1 3 2. So a_1 = 2, a_2=1, a_3=3, a_4=2.

So when sorted by a_i (ascending), then by index (ascending):

node 2 (a=1, index 2), node 4 (a=2, index 4), node 1 (a=2, index 1), node3 (a=3, index3). Wait, no. Wait, the sorted list is based on a_i and then index. So node 2 has a_i 1 (smallest), then nodes 4,1,3.

Wait, node 1 has a_i 2, index 1. Node4 has a_i 2, index4. So when sorted by a_i, then index, the order is node2 (a=1), node1 (a=2, index1), node4 (a=2, index4), node3 (a=3, index3). So sorted order is 2,1,4,3.

Now, for each u in this order:

Processing u=2 (a_i=1, d=1).

Allowed a_i: >=1 and <=2 (1+1=2).

For each node in the allowed subtree:

Check if their a_i is in [1,2], and if a_i=1, then their index >=2.

But u=2's a_i is 1, and allowed nodes are those with a_i >=1 and <=2.

But since u is the first in the sorted order, when processing u=2, the allowed nodes are:

node2 (a=1), node1 (a=2), node4 (a=2), and any other nodes connected to them with a_i in range [1,2].

But node3's a_i is 3, which is outside.

So during BFS:

start with node2.

Check its neighbors. Let's see:

adj[2] is [1].

Check node1: a_i=2 is within [1,2]. Since a_i=2>1, so allowed. So node1 is added.

node1's neighbors are 2,3.

For node3: a_i=3>2, so not allowed.

So node1's other neighbor is node2 (already visited).

So allowed subtree for u=2 is nodes 2 and 1.

But node1's a_i=2 is allowed. Then, during the BFS:

node1 is added to the queue.

node1's neighbors:

node2 (visited), node3 (a_i=3: not allowed), node3's edge.

But node3's a_i is 3>2, so not allowed.

So allowed subtree is nodes 2 and 1.

The children lists would be:

node2's children: [1]

node1's children: [] (since node3 is not allowed).

So the DP for node2 is (1 + dp[1]). dp[1] is 1 (since it has no children). So product is (1+1) = 2. So the count for u=2 is 2.

But according to the sample, u=2's allowed subsets are {2} and {2,1}? Wait, but in the allowed subtree for u=2, the allowed nodes are 2 and 1. The subsets are:

- {2}

- {1,2}

But the allowed subset must be connected and include u=2. So {2} is allowed, {2,1} is allowed. So the count is 2.

But according to the sample, the valid sets include {1} and others, but this processing of u=2 counts the subsets where the minimal a_i is 1 (u=2), which are {2}, {2,1}.

But the sample answer is 8. Let's see.

Next, processing u=1 (a=2, d=1). So a_u +d=3.

Allowed a_i: >=2, <=3.

But also, for nodes with a_i=2, their index must be >=1 (since u=1's index is 1).

So nodes with a_i=2 and index >=1 are allowed. So node1, node4.

The allowed subtree starts at node1. Let's see:

node1's neighbors are 2 (a=1, which is <2: not allowed), 3 (a=3, which is allowed).

So node3 is added. a=3 <= 2+1=3.

node3's neighbors are 1 and 4.

node4's a is 2, which is >=2, and since a=2 ==2, index4 >=1. So allowed.

So node4 is added.

node4's neighbors are 3 and perhaps others.

So allowed subtree for u=1 is nodes 1,3,4.

But wait, during the BFS:

Start with u=1.

Check neighbors: 2's a=1 <2: not allowed. 3's a=3 <=3: allowed.

Add node3.

node3's neighbors: 1 (visited), 4 (a=2 >=2, and a=2 ==2, index4 >=1: yes. So add node4.

node4's neighbors: 3 (visited), and perhaps others. If node4 is connected to other nodes (like in the sample input, node4 is connected to node3 only).

So allowed subtree is 1,3,4.

But node1's children list would be [3], node3's children are [4], node4's children are empty.

DP for node1:

dp[4] = 1 (no children). dp[3] = 1 * (1 + dp[4}) = 2. dp[1] = (1 + 2) = 3.

So the count for u=1 is 3.

These subsets are:

{1}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}, {3}, {3,4}, {4}? Wait, no. Wait, the allowed subtree for u=1 includes nodes 1,3,4. The subsets counted are those that include u=1 and are connected. So the subsets are:

{1} → count.

{1,3} → count.

{1,3,4} → count.

{1,3,4, 3's other children? No, only 4.}

So why does the DP for u=1 give 3? Because the calculation is (1 + dp[3]). dp[3] is (1 + dp[4}) → 2. So 1+2=3. So the DP for u=1 is 3, which counts the subsets {1}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}.

But according to the sample explanation, the valid subsets for u=1 are {1}, {1,2} (but wait, during u=1's processing, a_i must be >=2, so node2's a_i is 1 <2, so not allowed. So node2 is not part of the allowed subtree for u=1. So during u=1's processing, node2 is excluded. So the subsets are {1}, {1,3}, {1,3,4}. These are 3 subsets.

But in the sample explanation, {1,3} and {1,3,4} are valid. So this contributes 3 to the answer.

But the sample's answer is 8. Let's see.

Other u's:

Processing u=4 (a=2, index4). So a_u +d = 3. allowed a_i >=2, <=3. For nodes with a_i=2, their index must be >=4 (since u=4's index is 4). So nodes with a_i=2 and index >=4 are allowed. Which is only node4.

So allowed subtree for u=4:

Check node4's neighbors. Its neighbor is node3 (a=3 <=3, allowed. a=3>2, so no index check needed. So allowed.

node3's a=3 <=3. allowed. So node3 is added.

node3's neighbors: node1 (a=2 >=2, but a_i=2 equals a_u=2. index of node1 is 1 <4 → not allowed. So node1 is not added.

node3's other neighbor is node4 (already added).

So allowed subtree for u=4 is nodes4,3.

children lists: node4's children is [3], node3's children is empty.

DP for u=4:

dp[3] = 1. dp[4] = (1 + dp[3}) → 2. So count is 2.

These subsets are {4}, {4,3}.

These are valid subsets where the minimal a_i is 2 (u=4). But in the sample explanation, {3}, {3,4} are counted under u=3's processing. Hmm.

Wait, the sample explanation lists {3}, {4} as valid. But according to the processing, when processing u=3 (a=3), d=1. a_u +d=4. allowed a_i >=3, <=4. But the sample's d is 1, so a_u=3, allowed a_i <=4. But the other nodes have a_i=2,1,2. So during u=3's processing, allowed nodes are those with a_i >=3, which is only node3. So the allowed subtree is {3}, so the count is 1.

So for u=3, the count is 1.

Summing up all u's:

u=2: 2 subsets.

u=1: 3 subsets.

u=4: 2 subsets.

u=3: 1 subset.

Total is 2+3+2+1=8, which matches the sample.

Yes. So the approach works.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The code steps:

Read d, n.

Read a list of n integers.

Build adjacency list.

Sort nodes in increasing order of a_i, then by index.

For each u in this order:

   a_u_val = a[u-1]

   allowed a_v >= a_u_val and <= a_u_val +d.

   and for a_v == a_u_val, v >=u.

   perform BFS/DFS to find allowed subtree.

   build children lists.

   compute DP via post-order.

   add to answer.

Now, code.

But in Python, for each u, we need to perform a BFS, track parents, and build children lists.

Implementing this:

from collections import deque

MOD = 10**9+7

d, n = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # a is 0-based. node 1 is a[0], node 2 is a[1], etc.

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # 1-based.

for _ in range(n-1):

    u, v = map(int, input().split())

    adj[u].append(v)

    adj[v].append(u)

# Sort nodes by a_i, then by index (1-based)

sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: (a[x-1], x))

answer = 0

for u in sorted_nodes:

    a_u = a[u-1]

    max_allowed = a_u + d

    # BFS to find allowed subtree

    visited = [False] * (n+1)

    parent = [0]*(n+1)

    children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

    q = deque([u])

    visited[u] = True

    while q:

        v = q.popleft()

        for w in adj[v]:

            if not visited[w]:

                # Check if w is allowed

                aw = a[w-1]

                if aw < a_u or aw > max_allowed:

                    continue

                if aw == a_u and w < u:

                    continue

                # allowed

                visited[w] = True

                parent[w] = v

                children[v].append(w)

                q.append(w)

    # Compute DP using post-order traversal

    # Initialize dp dictionary

    dp = {}

    stack = [(u, False)]

    while stack:

        node, done = stack.pop()

        if not done:

            stack.append( (node, True) )

            # Push children in reverse order to process left to right

            for child in reversed(children[node]):

                stack.append( (child, False) )

        else:

            res = 1

            for child in children[node]:

                res = (res * (1 + dp[child])) % MOD

            dp[node] = res

    answer = (answer + dp[u]) % MOD

print(answer)

Testing this code against the first sample:

Sample input:

1 4

2 1 3 2

Edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

sorted_nodes would be sorted by a_i and index:

node 2 (a=1), node1 (a=2, index 1), node4 (a=2, index4), node3 (a=3, index3).

Processing u=2:

allowed a_i >=1 and <=2.

Allowed nodes:

node2 and node1 (since node1's a_i=2 is within range, and node1's index is 1 >=2? No. Wait, node1's index is 1, which is less than u=2. So when processing u=2, node1's a_i is 2 == a_u of 1? No. a_u is 1. So node1's a_i is 2, which is greater than a_u=1. So the condition for a_v == a_u (which is 1) would not apply. So node1 is allowed.

Thus, during BFS, node1 is added. Then, node1's neighbors are 3 (a_i=3>2: not allowed), so only node2 is processed.

So allowed subtree for u=2 is nodes 2 and 1.

children lists:

node2: [1]

node1: no children.

dp for node2 is (1 + dp[1}) → 1 + 1 = 2. So answer +=2.

Processing u=1:

allowed a_i >=2, <=3.

node1's index is 1. For nodes with a_i=2, their index must be >=1.

allowed nodes:

node1, node3 (a_i=3), node4 (a_i=2 >=2, and index4 >=1).

BFS starts at 1. neighbors are 2 (a_i=1 <2: not allowed), node3 (a_i=3 <=3: allowed). Add node3.

node3's neighbors are 1 and 4.

node4: a_i=2 >=2, index4 >=1: allowed. Add node4.

node4's neighbors: 3 (visited), no others.

So allowed subtree is 1,3,4.

children lists:

node1: [3]

node3: [4]

node4: []

dp for node3: (1+0) for node4's children (none) → 1. So node3's dp is 1. node1's dp is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Wait, no. Wait:

node4's children are empty. So dp[4] = 1.

node3's children are [4], so dp[3] = (1+1) → 2.

node1's children are [3], so dp[1] = (1 +2) → 3.

So answer +=3 → 5.

Processing u=4:

a_i=2, d=1. a_u +d=3.

allowed a_i >=2, <=3. For nodes with a_i=2, index >=4.

BFS starts at 4. neighbors are 3 (a_i=3 <=3. allowed. added. 3's a_i is 3>2, so no index check.

node3's neighbors: 4 (visited) and 1 (a_i=2 >=2, but since a_i=2 == a_u=2, node1's index is 1 <4 → not allowed. So node1 is not added.

node3's other neighbors (like 4) are visited. So allowed subtree is 4 and3.

children lists:

node4: [3]

node3: no children.

dp for node4 is (1 + dp[3}) → 1 +1 =2. So answer +=2 → 7.

Processing u=3:

a_i=3, d=1. allowed a_i >=3, <=4.

But other nodes' a_i are 2, 1, 2. So allowed subtree is only node3.

dp[3] =1. So answer +=1 → 8.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code works for the first sample.

The second sample's code should also work.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

For example, when d=0. Each subset must have all nodes with the same a_i. For each node u, the allowed subtree is nodes with a_i =a_u and index >=u.

Thus, for nodes with the same a_i, they are counted only when processed in order.

Thus, the code should correctly count each such subset once.

Another edge case: when all nodes have the same a_i. Then, d must be >=0. All subsets are valid as long as they are connected. The answer is the total number of non-empty connected subsets of the tree. But since the code processes each node in order (sorted by index), each subset is counted once (under the first node in the subset sorted by index).

But the total number of connected subsets of a tree is 2^(n-1) *n -1? No. The standard formula for the number of connected subsets in a tree is a bit different. For a tree with n nodes, each node contributes product of (1 + child subsets). But the total is the sum over all nodes of their DP values. Which, for a tree that is a chain (like a linked list), the number of connected subsets is sum_{k=1 to n} k*(n -k +1). But I'm not sure. However, in our approach, when all nodes have the same a_i and d is >=0, the code will count all connected subsets exactly once, as each subset is counted under the node with the smallest index in the subset.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.

So this should be the correct solution.
