Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the maximum possible value of a given C*++ expression. The key point here is that the order in which the summands are calculated affects the result. Our goal is to choose the order that maximizes the total sum.

First, I need to parse the input expression into individual summands. Each summand is either a++ or ++a, possibly multiplied by a coefficient. The summands can be separated by + or -, but since the expression is a sum, the overall sign of each summand depends on whether it's preceded by a '+' or '-'. Wait, right. The expression is a sequence of summands added or subtracted. So for each summand in the parsed list, we need to track its sign (positive or negative) based on the operators that separate the summands.

So first, the parsing step. Let's split the expression into terms with their signs. For example, in the first sample input "5*a++-3*++a+a++", the summands are:

+5*a++, -3*++a, +a++ (since the first term is positive, then after the '-', the next term is subtracted, and the '+' adds the third term).

Wait, the expression is built as a sequence of summands separated by '+' or '-'. So the initial term is either added or subtracted. Wait, the problem statement says: expression is summand | expression + summand | expression - summand. So the expression starts with a summand, then each subsequent summand is added or subtracted. So the overall sum is sum of (summand * sign), where the sign is determined by the operators. For example, the first summand has a positive sign. Each subsequent summand's sign is determined by the operator before it. So if the operator is '-', the summand is subtracted (so multiplied by -1), else added.

So, the first step is to parse the expression into summands along with their signs. Each summand is either "a++" or "++a", multiplied by a coefficient (which can be 1 if omitted). So for each summand, we need to extract:

- The coefficient (could be a positive integer, or default to 1)
- The type (a++ or ++a)
- The sign (positive or negative, based on the preceding operator)

Once we have all summands parsed, the next step is to determine the order in which to process them to maximize the total sum. Because each summand's processing affects the value of 'a' for subsequent summands, the order matters.

Each summand contributes a value to the total sum. The contribution depends on when it's processed. For a summand with a++ (post-increment), the coefficient is multiplied by the current value of 'a', then 'a' is increased by 1. For a summand with ++a (pre-increment), 'a' is increased by 1 first, then multiplied by the coefficient. So the order of processing affects the value of 'a' for other summands.

Our goal is to arrange the processing order of these summands such that the sum is maximized.

The problem now becomes: given a list of summands (each with their type, coefficient, and sign), find the processing order that maximizes the total sum.

Wait, but the sign of the summand is part of the problem. For example, if a summand has a negative sign (because it was subtracted in the original expression), then when we process it, we subtract that summand's value. But in order to maximize the total, we might want to minimize the contribution of such summands. However, the summand's contribution is determined by the order in which they are processed.

Hmm. Let's clarify. Each summand in the parsed list is either added or subtracted. So the total sum is the sum of (sign_i * value_i), where value_i is the contribution of the summand (which depends on the order of processing). So for summands with a positive sign (added), we want their value_i to be as large as possible. For summands with negative signs (subtracted), we want their value_i to be as small as possible (since subtracting a smaller value gives a larger total).

But how to model this? The order in which summands are processed affects all subsequent summands. Because each summand's processing increases 'a' by 1 (either before or after the value is computed).

Let's model each summand's effect. Let's consider that each summand contributes a certain value, which depends on the current value of 'a' at the time of processing. Additionally, each summand increments 'a' by 1. The problem is similar to scheduling jobs where each job has a certain effect on the state (a) and contributes a value based on when it's processed.

The key is to find the order of processing the summands such that the sum of (sign_i * value_i) is maximized.

Let's model each summand as an operation. Let's see:

For a summand with type 'a++' (post-increment), the value contributed is coeff * a. Then a increases by 1.

For a summand with type '++a' (pre-increment), a increases by 1 first, then the value is coeff * a. So the value is coeff * (a + 1), and a becomes a + 1 + 0 (since the increment was already done).

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

For post-increment (summand is a++):
- value = coeff * a
- a += 1

For pre-increment (summand is ++a):
- a += 1
- value = coeff * a

Each summand, when processed, contributes to the total sum (with their sign) and modifies a.

So the challenge is to arrange the processing order of these summands to maximize the total sum (sum of (sign * value)).

The initial value of a is given.

So the problem is similar to scheduling jobs that modify a resource, and the order affects the total.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, but with a large number of summands (up to 1000), the state space could be too big.

But wait, the summands can be up to 1000. So any O(n^3) solution is probably too slow.

Alternative approach: find a greedy strategy to order the summands optimally.

Let's think about the effect of processing a summand. Each summand affects a in some way. The order in which we process them can affect how much each contributes.

For a positive sign summand (added to the total), we want to process it when a is as large as possible, so that its value is higher. But the problem is that processing a summand may increase a (for ++a) before others. Wait, no. Let's see:

Suppose summand S is a post-increment (a++), and is part of the sum with a positive sign. Then, the value is coeff * a. Processing this summand early when a is small would give a smaller contribution. But if processed later, when a has been increased by other summands, the contribution would be larger.

But in the case of a post-increment summand, processing it later gives a higher value. Because a would have been increased by other summands that were processed before. But for a post-increment, the value is coeff * a, then a increases by 1. So if we process S later, a is higher, so the value is higher.

Similarly, for a pre-increment summand (++a) with positive sign: when processed, a is first increased by 1, then multiplied by coeff. So the value is coeff*(a+1). Then a becomes a+1. So if this summand is processed later, after other summands have increased a, then (a+1) is higher. So again, processing it later gives a higher contribution.

But this is only true for summands with positive sign. For summands with negative sign, the opposite applies: we want their contribution to be as small as possible (since they are subtracted). So for a summand with negative sign and post-increment, we want to process it early, when a is small, so that coeff*a is small (so subtracting a smaller value gives a larger total). Similarly for pre-increment.

So, the strategy depends on the sign of the summand and the type (pre or post).

But how can we model the optimal order? The problem is that the order of processing summands affects a in a way that's cumulative. Each summand's processing affects a, which affects the value of all subsequent summands.

So the key is to find the order of summands such that for summands that contribute positively (i.e., their sign is positive), we process them in an order that maximizes their individual contribution, and for those with negative sign, process them in a way that minimizes their individual contribution.

But since all summands are part of the same sequence, the order is interdependent.

Let's consider all summands as contributing a certain value, and each summand modifies the state of a. We need to find the order that maximizes the sum of all contributions.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a priority queue approach, where we greedily select the next summand that gives the maximum possible marginal gain.

But how to model the marginal gain for each possible summand when considering their possible order.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the optimal order by sorting the summands based on some criteria.

Let's try to model the effect of processing a summand. For each summand, when processed, the contribution is (sign) * (coeff * a) if it's a post-increment, or (sign) * (coeff * (a + 1)) if it's a pre-increment. Then, after processing, a increases by 1.

But the value of a depends on the summands processed before. So the order is critical.

This looks similar to the problem of scheduling jobs with precedence constraints and each job's profit depends on the time it's processed. However, in this case, the "time" is the order in the sequence, and the effect is additive on a.

But how to model the optimal order here.

Another angle: Let's model the effect on 'a' as a sequence. Suppose that there are k summands. Each summand, when processed, adds 1 to a. So the total a after processing all summands is initial_a + k. However, the order in which the summands are processed affects how much each contributes to the total.

So the problem is to find the order of summands that maximizes the sum of (sign_i * value_i), where value_i is coeff_i * (a_i) for post-increment or coeff_i * (a_i + 1) for pre-increment. a_i is the value of a before processing the summand (for post-increment) or a before the pre-increment (but then after the summand is processed, a increases by 1).

Wait, for pre-increment summand:

Processing order: a is increased by 1, then the value is coeff * a (after increment). So, when processing a pre-increment summand, the value is coeff * (current_a + 1). Then a becomes current_a + 1 + 1? Wait, no. Let's see:

Original a is x.

If summand is ++a (pre-increment):

- a is increased by 1 → a becomes x + 1.
- value is coeff * (x + 1).

So after processing this summand, a is x + 1.

So the summand's effect is that a increases by 1, and the value is coeff*(x+1).

For a post-increment summand (a++):

- value is coeff * x.
- a becomes x + 1.

So each summand, regardless of type, increases a by 1. But the value depends on the a before or after the increment.

So the order in which summands are processed determines the a value used for their contribution.

Let me model each summand's contribution as a function of the current a value at the time of processing.

For a summand S_i with type post-increment and coefficient c, and sign s_i:

contribution_i = s_i * c * a_current

a_current increases by 1 after.

For summand S_i with type pre-increment, coefficient c, and sign s_i:

contribution_i = s_i * c * (a_current + 1)

a_current increases by 1 after.

So the key is to arrange the summands in such a way that the sum of these contributions is maximized.

But the a_current is dynamic and depends on the order.

Now, the problem reduces to scheduling the summands in a sequence that maximizes the sum of their contributions, where each summand's contribution depends on their position in the sequence.

This seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming, but given that there are 1000 summands, a standard DP approach would be O(n^2), which is manageable.

But perhaps there's a greedy way to order the summands.

Let's think about two summands and decide which order is better. Suppose we have summand A and summand B. Let's compute the difference in total contribution when processing A before B versus B before A.

If processing A before B yields a higher total contribution, then we should prefer that order.

So for two summands, we can compare which order is better.

Let's model this for two summands.

Case 1: A is a post-increment summand with sign sA and coefficient cA.

Case 2: B is a pre-increment summand with sign sB and coefficient cB.

Initial a is a0.

Processing order A then B:

contribution A: sA * cA * a0

a becomes a0 + 1.

contribution B: sB * cB * (a0 + 1 + 1) → because for pre-increment, a is increased by 1, then multiplied by cB. So contribution is sB * cB * (a0 + 1 + 1) ?

Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

Processing B (pre-increment) when current a is a0 +1 (after A is processed):

- a is increased by 1 → a becomes a0 + 2.
- contribution is sB * cB * (a0 + 2) 

So for order A then B:

contribution A: sA * cA * a0 → a increases by 1 (a becomes a0+1)
contribution B: sB * cB * (a0+1 + 1) = sB*cB*(a0 + 2) → a becomes a0+2 + 1? Wait no. Wait when processing a summand, regardless of type, a is increased by 1.

Wait, no. For post-increment (a++), after processing, a increases by 1.

For pre-increment (++a), processing the summand increases a by 1 (so the value is coeff*(a+1)), and then a is increased by 1 again? Or is it that the pre-increment summand increases a by 1 once?

Wait, the description says:

For summand with "a++", during calculation, the value is multiplied by the coefficient, then a increases by 1.

For summand with "++a", during calculation, a increases by 1, then multiplied by coefficient.

But in both cases, after processing the summand, a is increased by 1. Because:

For a++:

value = coefficient * a → then a += 1.

For ++a:

a += 1 → then value = coefficient * a.

So in both cases, after processing the summand, a has increased by 1.

Wait, no. Wait in the problem statement:

"Increment ::= a++ | ++a

coefficient is multiplied by the increment. For a++, the value is coeff * a, then a increases by 1. For ++a, a increases by 1, then the value is coeff * a."

So in both cases, after processing the summand, a is increased by 1. Because for a++:

Original a is x. Value is c * x. Then a becomes x + 1.

For ++a:

Original a is x. a becomes x + 1. Value is c * (x + 1).

So in both cases, the summand's processing results in a being x + 1.

So each summand increases a by 1 when processed.

So, regardless of the type, each summand contributes +1 to a. The difference is when the a is used to compute the value.

So when processing summands, the order determines how much a is at the time of each summand's contribution.

So for two summands A and B, the order A then B would process A first, contributing based on a's initial value, then B contributes based on a's initial +1, etc.

Now, the key is to compare the difference in total contribution between the two possible orders (A first or B first).

Let's compute the total contribution in both orders and see which is larger.

Let’s take two summands, S1 and S2.

We need to compute (S1 first then S2) vs (S2 first then S1).

The total contribution in each case is:

Case 1: S1 then S2.

Contribution S1: s1 * (type1 contribution based on a0)
Contribution S2: s2 * (type2 contribution based on a0 + 1)
a becomes a0 + 2.

Case 2: S2 then S1.

Contribution S2: s2 * (type2 contribution based on a0)
Contribution S1: s1 * (type1 contribution based on a0 + 1)
a becomes a0 + 2.

So the difference in total contributions between case 1 and case2 is:

[ (s1 * c1 * a0) + (s2 * (c2 * (a0 + 1 + (type2 is pre ? 0 : 0)) )) ] vs [ (s2 * (c2 * (a0 + (type2 is pre ? 1 : 0))) ) + (s1 * c1 * (a0 + 1)) ]

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's model each summand's contribution based on their type.

Let’s define for summand S:

If S is a post-increment (a++), then its contribution when processed at step i (with a current value of x) is s * c * x, and then a becomes x+1.

If S is a pre-increment (++a), then its contribution is s * c * (x+1), and a becomes x+1.

So the difference between processing S1 first and S2 first is:

Contribution when S1 first: S1 contributes s1 * c1 * x0 (if post) or s1 * c1*(x0+1) (if pre). Then S2 contributes s2 * c2 * (x0 + 1) (if post) or s2 * c2*(x0 + 2) (if pre).

If S2 is processed first:

S2 contributes s2 * c2 * x0 (if post) or s2 * c2*(x0+1) (if pre). Then S1 contributes s1 * c1 * (x0 + 1) (if post) or s1 * c1*(x0 + 2) (if pre).

So the difference between the two orders is:

(S1 first) - (S2 first) = [s1 contribution when a is x0] + [s2 contribution when a is x0 + 1] - ( [s2 contribution when a is x0] + [s1 contribution when a is x0 +1] )

Which simplifies to:

(s1_contribution_x0 - s1_contribution_x0_plus_1) + (s2_contribution_x0_plus_1 - s2_contribution_x0)

If this difference is positive, then S1 should come before S2. Otherwise, S2 should come before S1.

So for each pair of summands S1 and S2, we can compute whether S1 should come before S2 or vice versa.

This is similar to the greedy pairwise swap condition: if swapping two elements increases the total, then we should swap.

So the optimal order is to arrange the summands such that for any two summands S1 and S2, the order S1 before S2 is better than the reverse if the pairwise condition holds.

This suggests that the summands can be sorted using a comparator function that determines which of the two summands should come first.

But how to model this comparator function.

Let's formalize this.

For summands S1 and S2:

Define delta = (S1's contribution when a is x) + (S2's contribution when a is x + 1) - (S2's contribution when a is x) - (S1's contribution when a is x + 1)

If delta > 0, then processing S1 first is better.

The delta depends on the type and sign of S1 and S2.

But since x can vary, but in the pairwise comparison, the order of processing S1 and S2 will affect their contribution based on their position in the sequence. However, the delta should be independent of x, because in the difference, x is canceled out.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's compute delta for different types and signs.

Let's consider all possible combinations.

Case 1: S1 is post-increment, S2 is post-increment.

Then:

delta = (s1 * c1 * x) + (s2 * c2 * (x +1)) - (s2 * c2 * x + s1 * c1 * (x +1))

= s1 c1 x + s2 c2 (x +1) - s2 c2 x - s1 c1 (x+1)

= s1 c1 x - s1 c1 (x +1) + s2 c2 (x +1) - s2 c2 x

= -s1 c1 + s2 c2

If delta > 0, then S1 should come before S2.

So for two post-increment summands, the order depends on the sign and coefficient.

The condition is -s1 c1 + s2 c2 > 0 → s2 c2 > s1 c1.

So, in this case, S2 should come before S1 if s2 c2 > s1 c1.

Wait, the delta is -s1c1 + s2 c2. So if delta>0, then S1 before S2 is better. So when s2 c2 > s1 c1, then delta is positive, so S1 should come before S2. Wait no. Because delta is (S1 first) - (S2 first). If delta>0, then S1 first is better. So the condition is:

-s1 c1 + s2 c2 >0 → s2 c2 > s1 c1.

So if s2 c2 > s1 c1, then processing S1 first gives a higher total than processing S2 first. Wait, this seems counterintuitive. Let's see:

Suppose S1 has s1=1, c1=1 (positive post). S2 has s2=1, c2=2.

delta = -1*1 + 1*2 = 1>0. So S1 first is better. But if S1 is processed first, then S2's contribution is (x+1)*2, whereas if S2 is processed first, its contribution is x*2, which is less. So processing S2 later (after S1) allows it to contribute more. So why is delta positive, implying that processing S1 first is better?

Wait, no. Let's compute the two scenarios:

Order S1 first: S1 contributes 1*1*x (x is initial a). S2 contributes 1*2*(x+1). Total: x + 2(x+1) = 3x +2.

Order S2 first: S2 contributes 1*2*x. S1 contributes 1*1*(x+1). Total: 2x + x +1 = 3x +1.

So processing S1 first gives a higher total. So in this case, when s2 c2 (2) > s1 c1 (1), S1 first is better, which aligns with delta>0.

So the comparator would sort summands in such a way that for two post-increment summands, the one with higher (s_i * c_i) comes later. Because in this case, S2 has higher s*c than S1, and S1 should come before S2 to allow S2 to use a higher a value.

But how does this generalize to other types?

Let's consider another case.

Case 2: S1 is post-increment, S2 is pre-increment.

S1 is post: contribution when processed at a=x is s1 c1 x. Then a becomes x+1.

S2 is pre: contribution when processed at a=y is s2 c2 (y + 1).

So delta is:

[ s1 c1 x + s2 c2 (x+1 +1) ] - [ s2 c2 (x+1) + s1 c1 (x+1) ]

= s1 c1 x + s2 c2 (x+2) - s2 c2 (x+1) - s1 c1 (x+1)

= s1 c1 (x - x -1) + s2 c2 (x+2 - x -1)

= -s1 c1 + s2 c2 (1)

So delta = -s1 c1 + s2 c2.

So the condition for S1 first being better is delta >0 → s2 c2 > s1 c1.

So regardless of the type of S2, when comparing S1 (post) and S2 (pre), the condition is the same as in case 1.

Wait, interesting. Let's check another example.

Case 3: S1 is pre-increment, S2 is post-increment.

delta = (s1 c1 (x +1) + s2 c2 (x +1) ) - (s2 c2 x + s1 c1 (x +2) )

= s1 c1 (x+1) + s2 c2 (x+1) - s2 c2 x - s1 c1 (x +2)

= s1 c1 (x+1 - x -2) + s2 c2 (x+1 -x)

= s1 c1 (-1) + s2 c2 (1)

delta = -s1 c1 + s2 c2.

So again, the condition is s2 c2 > s1 c1 → delta >0, so S1 should come before S2.

Hmm. So for any two summands, regardless of their types (post or pre), the condition delta is -s1 c1 + s2 c2. So the comparator between any two summands S1 and S2 is based on whether s2 c2 is greater than s1 c1.

If s2 c2 > s1 c1 → then processing S1 first gives a higher total than processing S2 first.

Wait, that's surprising. So regardless of the type of the summands (post or pre), the comparator is based on the product of their sign and coefficient.

But wait, let's check another case where one summand is pre and the other is pre.

Case 4: S1 is pre-increment, S2 is pre-increment.

delta = (s1 c1 (x +1) + s2 c2 (x +2) ) - (s2 c2 (x +1) + s1 c1 (x +2) )

= s1 c1 (x+1 - x -2) + s2 c2 (x+2 - x -1)

= s1 c1 (-1) + s2 c2 (1)

delta = -s1 c1 + s2 c2.

So again, the same condition.

So in all cases, the pairwise comparator is determined by the condition s2 * c2 > s1 * c1. If that's the case, then S1 should come before S2 in the processing order.

Wait, this is a key insight. The optimal order of processing summands is to sort them in the order of increasing (s_i * c_i). Because whenever s_i * c_i < s_j * c_j, we want to process i before j. Because the delta is s_j c_j - s_i c_i. So if s_j c_j is larger, then delta is positive, so processing i before j is better.

So the comparator between two summands S1 and S2 is: S1 should come before S2 if (s1 * c1) < (s2 * c2). Because then, when S1 has a smaller s*c, processing it first allows the summands with larger s*c to be processed later, when a is higher, which increases their contribution.

Wait, but the comparator is based on the delta being positive when s2 c2 > s1 c1. If delta is positive, then processing S1 first is better. So in order to maximize the delta (i.e., the difference between S1 first and S2 first), we want to process S1 first when s2 c2 > s1 c1.

So the optimal order is to process summands in ascending order of (s_i * c_i). Because summands with higher s*c will be processed later, when a is higher, contributing more.

But why? Because when s_i * c_i is higher, processing them later allows them to be multiplied by a higher a value.

Yes. For example, a summand with s_i=1, c_i=3 (positive contribution) would be better processed after a summand with s_i=1, c_i=2, so that the a value is higher when the first summand is processed. Wait, no. Wait, in the comparator, the summand with lower s*c should be processed first. Because if summand A has s*c of 2, summand B has s*c of 3. Then, processing A first and B later gives a higher total.

Because when A is processed first, B is processed when a is higher. Since B has a higher s*c, the impact of a higher a on B's contribution is larger.

So the summands are sorted in increasing order of (s_i * c_i). This way, summands with higher s*c are processed later, when a is larger, thus maximizing their contribution.

This holds for all types of summands (post and pre-increment). Because the delta in pairwise comparison is determined by s_i * c_i and s_j * c_j, regardless of their types.

So, the solution approach is:

1. Parse the input expression into summands, tracking their sign (positive or negative), coefficient, and type (post or pre).

2. For each summand, compute s_i * c_i, where s_i is the sign (1 or -1), and c_i is the coefficient.

3. Sort the summands in ascending order of s_i * c_i. So summands with lower s*c are processed first.

4. Process the summands in this order, calculating their contribution to the total sum based on their type and the current a value.

By sorting the summands in this way, we ensure that each summand is processed as late as possible (if it has a higher s*c), thus maximizing their contribution.

Now, the next step is to parse the input expression into summands with their sign, coefficient, and type.

Parsing steps:

The input is a string with no spaces. The summands are separated by '+' or '-' operators. The first summand has an implicit '+' sign.

So, the parsing steps are:

- Split the expression into tokens separated by '+' and '-'. The operators between summands determine the sign of the next summand.

For example, the expression "5*a++-3*++a+a++" is split into:

["5*a++", "-3*++a", "+a++"]

But wait, the splitting needs to account for the operators. The first summand is preceded by nothing (so positive sign), and subsequent summands are preceded by '+' or '-'.

So, the correct approach is to split the expression into a list of operators and summands.

But perhaps it's easier to iterate through the string and split into summands with their signs.

Let me think. For example:

The expression starts with a summand. Then each '+' or '-' is followed by another summand. So, the signs can be determined by the operators preceding each summand.

The initial sign is positive. Then, for each operator, the sign of the next summand is determined by the operator.

So for the example "5*a++-3*++a+a++":

The first summand is '5*a++' with sign '+'.

Then comes the '-', so the next summand '3*++a' has sign '-'.

Then comes '+', so the next summand 'a++' has sign '+'.

Thus, the summands are:

+5*a++, -3*++a, +a++.

So the parsing steps are:

- Split the expression into tokens where each token starts after a '+' or '-'.

But the first token starts at the beginning.

So, the code can iterate through the expression string, splitting into summands by '+' and '-'.

An alternative approach is to split the expression into summands using a regular expression.

For example, split the string into parts that start with either the beginning of the string or '+' or '-'. The regular expression would be something like [+-]?[^+-]*, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can split the expression on the regex [+-], but we need to include the sign in the split. However, the first character could be a summand (without a leading sign). For example, "a+++++a" is split into ['a', '+++', '+a'].

Wait, the example given in the second input is "a+++++a". Let's see:

The correct summands are "a++" (sign +), "++a" (sign +), and the third is "+a", but wait, no. Let's look at the example:

The input is 3 and expression "a+++++a". The output is 8. According to the note, the summands are a++ and ++a, each with a positive sign.

But the expression is parsed as a++ + ++a. So the '+' signs between them are the operators. So the first summand is a++, then '+', then ++a.

But the problem says that the summands are separated by '+' or '-'. So in the case of "a+++++a", perhaps the split is a++ ++ +a, but that's not correct. Or perhaps it's a+++ ++a. But how?

Wait, the expression is written as a+++++a. How to parse this?

The correct parsing is a++ + ++a. Because the first three '+' signs would form a++ followed by '+', then ++a.

But how to split the string into summands.

This is a tricky part. Parsing the expression correctly is essential.

Another approach is to split the expression into tokens by the operators '+' and '-'. The first token is the first summand (with sign '+'), and the rest are summands preceded by '+' or '-'.

But the problem is that the '+' and '-' may appear in the middle of a summand, but according to the problem statement, the summands are separated by '+' and '-'.

So, the summands are of the form:

summand ::= coefficient*increment | increment.

But the increment is a++ or ++a. So the summands can be split by the '+' or '-' operators that are not part of an increment.

So, the splitting is done at the '+' or '-' that are not part of "++a" or "a++".

But how to identify those operators.

The key is that the '+' or '-' that separate summands are those that are not part of an increment.

In other words, the '+' in the summands (like in a++ or ++a) are part of the increment, while the '+' or '-' between summands are operators.

So, the splitting points are '+' or '-' that are not adjacent to the 'a' in the increment.

Hmm. So in the expression "a+++++a", the first 'a' is followed by "+++", but how to split.

Wait, the correct way is to split into "a++" and "++a".

But the original expression is written as "a+++++a".

Breaking it down:

The first two '+' form a++ (post-increment). Then, the next three '+' are possibly part of the next summand.

But the summand after the first a++ is separated by a '+', but the next summand is ++a, which starts with '++a'.

So the splitting is:

"a++" is the first summand, then the next '+' is the operator (so sign is '+'), then "++a".

But then there is another '+', which would be part of the next summand. But the example indicates that there are two summands: a++ and ++a.

Ah, perhaps the expression is "a++ + ++a".

But how to parse "a+++++a" as two summands a++ and ++a, separated by a '+' operator.

Wait, the string is a++ followed by +++a.

But the summand after the '+' operator would be ++a. Because the summand can start with '++a'.

So in the original string "a+++++a", the first a++ is a summand, followed by a '+' operator, then the next summand is ++a. But there's an extra '+a' left? How?

Alternatively, perhaps the input "a+++++a" is parsed as a++ + ++a. Because:

The first two '+' are part of a++ (post-increment). Then there's a '+' which is the operator. Then, the next two '+' are part of ++a (pre-increment). Then, the final 'a' is left, but that's not correct. So perhaps the input is a++ + ++a, which is two summands.

But this is getting complicated. So the parsing code must correctly split the summands.

The key is that each summand is either a coefficient followed by * and increment, or just an increment.

So the increment is either a++ or ++a.

So, to parse a summand, we can look for the pattern of coefficient (optional), followed by * (optional), followed by either a++ or ++a.

So, perhaps using regular expressions would help.

For example, the regex for a summand could be:

(\d*\*?)?(\+\+a|a\+\+)

But that's not quite right. Let's think.

A summand can be:

- coefficient*increment: e.g., 5*a++, 3*++a.

- increment: e.g., a++, ++a.

So the regex for the summand can be:

(\d+)?\*?(\+\+a|a\+\+)

But the coefficient may be absent (default to 1). So the regex can match either:

- an optional coefficient (digits) followed by '*' and the increment.

- the increment part (either a++ or ++a).

So the regex for a summand could be:

^(\d+)?\*?(\+\+a|a\+\+)$

But this may not capture all cases correctly.

Alternatively, split the summand into coefficient and increment.

So, for each summand:

If there's a '*' in the summand, then the part before '*' is the coefficient, and the part after is the increment.

Otherwise, the entire summand is the increment (with coefficient 1).

But the summand can also have a coefficient without a '*' (which is invalid?), but according to the problem statement, the summand is either coefficient*increment or increment. So the coefficient must be followed by a '*' if it's present.

So, for example, "5a++" is invalid, but "5*a++" is valid.

So, in the summand, the presence of a '*' indicates that the part before is the coefficient, and the part after is the increment.

So, for parsing each summand:

- Split into parts before and after '*' if present.

- If there is a '*':

   - coefficient is the part before.

   - increment is the part after.

- else:

   - coefficient is 1.

   - increment is the entire summand.

But also, the increment must be either 'a++' or '++a'.

So, the steps for parsing each summand are:

1. Split the summand into coefficient and increment parts.

   - Check if the summand contains '*'.

   - If yes, split into coefficient_part and increment_part.

   - coefficient_part is the part before '*', which is the coefficient. It can be empty? Wait, according to the problem statement, summand is coefficient*increment, where coefficient is 0-1000. So if there is a '*' then the coefficient is the part before.

   - So, for example, "a++" is an increment (no coefficient), coefficient is 1.

   For "5*a++", coefficient is 5, increment is a++.

   For "++a", coefficient is 1, increment is ++a.

   For "*a++" is invalid? No, because according to the problem statement, the coefficient can't be omitted when the '*' is present. Wait, no. The summand is either coefficient*increment or increment. So if there is a '*', then the coefficient is present.

   Wait, the problem statement says:

summand ::= increment | coefficient*increment.

So the coefficient is present only if the summand is written as coefficient*increment.

So, for example, "5*a++" is a summand with coefficient 5, increment a++.

"a++" is a summand with coefficient 1, increment a++.

So when parsing a summand, if there's a '*' then the coefficient is the part before the '*', and the increment is the part after. Otherwise, the coefficient is 1 and the increment is the summand.

So, the code for parsing a summand is:

split = summand_str.split('*', 1)

if len(split) == 2:

   coefficient = split[0]

   increment = split[1]

else:

   coefficient = '1'

   increment = split[0]

But wait, if the summand is like "a++", then split is ['a++'], so coefficient is '1', increment is 'a++'.

If the summand is "5*a++", split into ['5', 'a++'] → coefficient 5, increment a++.

If the summand is "++a", split into ['++a'] → coefficient 1, increment ++a.

But what if the summand is "3++a"? That's split into ['3', '++a'] → coefficient 3, increment ++a.

But wait, the increment must be either a++ or ++a. So the code should validate that the increment part is either 'a++' or '++a'.

But according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so we can assume that the summands are correctly formatted.

So, the parsing code can proceed as:

For each summand_str (after splitting into summands with their signs):

   if '*' in summand_str:

       coeff_part, incr_part = summand_str.split('*', 1)

   else:

       coeff_part = '1'

       incr_part = summand_str

   coefficient = int(coeff_part)

   if incr_part == 'a++':

       type = 'post'

   elif incr_part == '++a':

       type = 'pre'

   else:

       # invalid, but input is guaranteed valid.

So, once we have the coefficient and type for each summand, along with the sign, we can compute s_i * c_i for each summand.

Now, the plan is:

- Split the input expression into summands with their signs.

- For each summand, parse into coefficient, type (pre or post), and sign.

- Sort the summands in ascending order of s_i * c_i.

- Process the summands in this order, applying each to the current a value, and accumulating the total sum.

Processing each summand:

Initially, a is the input value.

For each summand in sorted order:

   compute the contribution:

   if type is 'post':

       value = sign * coefficient * a

   else:

       value = sign * coefficient * (a + 1)

   add value to total.

   then, increment a by 1.

So, after each summand, a is increased by 1, regardless of the type.

Now, let's test this approach with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

1

5*a++-3*++a+a++

Parsing the summands:

The first summand is '5*a++', sign is +.

Coefficient is 5, type post.

Second summand is '-3*++a', sign is -.

Coefficient is 3, type pre. The sign is -1.

Third summand is '+a++', sign +.

Coefficient is 1, type post.

Now, for each summand, compute s_i * c_i:

Summand1: s=+1, c=5 → 5.

Summand2: s=-1, c=3 → -3.

Summand3: s=+1, c=1 → 1.

So s_i*c_i values are 5, -3, 1.

Sorting them in ascending order: -3, 1, 5.

So the order of processing is summand2 (-3, pre), summand3 (1, post), summand1 (5, post).

Wait, but the summand2 has s_i*c_i = -3. Summand3 has 1. Summand1 has 5.

So the sorted order is summand2 (-3), summand3 (1), summand1 (5).

Processing:

Initial a =1.

Processing summand2 (type pre, s=-3):

value = (-3) * (1 + 1) = -3 *2 =-6.

Total is -6.

a becomes 1 +1 =2.

Processing summand3 (type post, s=1):

value = 1 *1 *2 = 2.

Total becomes -6 +2 =-4.

a becomes 3.

Processing summand1 (type post, s=5):

value =5 *3 =15.

Total becomes -4 +15 =11.

a becomes4.

Which matches the sample output of 11.

So the approach works for the first sample.

Sample input 2:

3

a+++++a

The expression is 'a+++++a'.

Parsing this into summands:

The first summand is 'a++', sign +.

Then comes '+', which is the operator. The next summand is '++a', sign +.

But how is the original string split into summands?

The original string is 'a+++++a'.

We can split this into 'a++' followed by '+', then '++a'.

But there is an extra '+' in between. Wait, how?

Alternatively, the summands are 'a++' and '++a', separated by '+' and '+'.

But according to the problem statement, the summands are separated by '+' or '-'.

So the correct parsing is:

The string is a++ + ++a.

But how to split the '+++++' into '+', '++', 'a'?

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to split the summands as follows:

The first 'a++' is followed by '+', then '++a'. But then the '+++++a' part would be split into '+', '++a' ?

Wait, no. Let's think of the original string as 'a+++++a':

Looking for the operators that separate summands.

The first summand is a++.

Then, the next operator is '+', which starts the next summand. But what's the next summand?

The remaining part is '+++a'.

But the summand must be either coefficient*increment or increment.

In the remaining part, '+++a', the first two '+' would form '++a' (pre-increment), but there's an extra '+'.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's see:

The problem says that the summands are separated by '+' or '-', and the summands are either increment or coefficient*increment.

So, the summands in the example 'a+++++a' must be 'a++', then '+', then '++a', and another '+a' summand? But that doesn't make sense.

But according to the sample input, the expression has two summands: a++ and ++a.

The sample input says that the output is 8, which is achieved by processing a++ first (3, a becomes4) and then ++a (5, contributing 5).

Alternatively, if processed in reverse order, ++a (4+1=5, then a becomes5) and a++ (5, then a becomes6). Sum is 5+5=10, which is larger than the sample output. But the sample output is 8. Wait, but in the note, it's said that the two summands' processing order gives 8, but according to this approach, it would be 3+5=8.

Hmm, this suggests that my approach may have a mistake.

Wait, sample input 2:

Initial a is 3.

The summands are a++ (coefficient 1, sign +), and ++a (coefficient 1, sign +).

s_i * c_i for each is 1*1=1 and 1*1=1. So their sorted order is either one first.

Processing order can be either.

If processed a++ first:

value = 3*1 → 3. a becomes4.

Then, ++a: a is increased to5. value is 5*1=5. total 3+5=8.

Which matches the sample.

If processed in reverse order:

++a first: a is increased to4. value is4*1=4. a becomes4+1=5? Or no. Wait, the processing of a pre-increment summand:

For summand ++a, type pre:

value is coeff * (a+1). Then a increases by 1.

So processing ++a when a=3:

a increases by 1 →4.

value is 1 *4 =4.

a becomes4 +1? Or after processing, a is increased by 1.

Wait, no. For a pre-increment summand:

When processing, first a increases by 1, then the value is coeff * a.

But after processing, a is increased by 1 (due to the summand's processing).

Wait, no. For a pre-increment summand:

The processing steps are:

a increases by 1 → a = a_prev +1.

The value is coeff * a_new.

Then, a increases by 1 again (because every summand adds 1 to a)?

Wait, no. Wait according to the problem statement:

When processing a summand:

For a++: value is coeff*a, then a increases by 1.

For ++a: a increases by 1, then value is coeff*a. Then a increases by 1 again?

No. Wait, the problem statement says:

When processing a summand with a++, the a is increased by 1 after computing the value.

For ++a, the a is increased by 1 before computing the value. But after the value is computed, a is increased by 1 again?

No. No. Because the problem statement says:

"Increment ::= a++ | ++a"

coefficient * increment.

For a++: during calculation, the value is multiplied by the coefficient, then a increases by 1.

For ++a: during calculation, a is increased by 1, then multiplied by the coefficient.

But the summand is part of the expression. So each summand's processing increases a by 1, regardless of type.

Wait, no. The problem statement says:

The summands are calculated one after another. For each summand:

If it's a++: compute value (coeff * a), then a increases by 1.

If it's ++a: a increases by 1, compute value (coeff * a), then a increases by 1 again?

No, that's not possible. Because then each summand would increase a by 1 for post and 2 for pre.

But according to the problem statement:

In the first sample, after processing all summands, the a is increased by 3 (since there are three summands).

But in sample 1, the initial a is 1.

After processing:

summand2 (pre-increment): a becomes 2.

summand3 (post): a becomes3.

summand1 (post): a becomes4.

So each summand increases a by 1, regardless of type.

Ah, so the summand's processing increases a by 1. For the pre-increment summand:

Processing steps:

1. a increases by 1 (pre-increment part).

2. Compute value: coeff * a.

3. a increases by 1 (due to the summand processing).

Wait, that would make a total of 2 increments per pre-increment summand. But that's not possible.

Wait, no. The problem statement says:

For summands containing "a++", during calculation, first the value of a is multiplied by the coefficient, then a is increased by 1.

For summands containing "++a", during calculation, first a is increased by 1, then multiplied by the coefficient.

So, for a summand of type a++:

value = coeff * a.

a +=1.

For a summand of type ++a:

a +=1.

value = coeff * a.

a +=1.

Wait, no. The problem statement says that after the calculation of the summand, a is increased by 1. Or is the increment part of the summand's processing.

Wait, the problem statement says:

For example, if the summand is "a++", then during the calculation first the value of the "a" variable is multiplied by the coefficient, then value of "a" is increased by 1. If the summand contains "++a", then the actions are performed in reverse order: first a is increased by 1, then multiplied by the coefficient.

So, for each summand:

- If it's a++:

   value = coeff * a.

   a +=1.

- If it's ++a:

   a +=1.

   value = coeff * a.

So each summand increases a by 1, but the order of the increment and value calculation depends on the type.

So in the case of a pre-increment summand, the a is increased by 1 before the value is calculated, and then another increment is applied after? No.

No. The summand's processing involves either:

For a++:

   value = coeff * a.

   a increases by 1.

For ++a:

   a increases by 1.

   value = coeff * a.

So, each summand's processing increases a by 1 once.

So, for a pre-increment summand, the steps are:

a = a +1.

value = coeff * a.

a remains at that new value.

No, wait. Let's take an example.

Initial a=3.

Processing a pre-increment summand (++a):

- a increases by 1 →4.

- value is coeff *4.

- a remains 4? Or is there an additional increment?

According to the problem statement:

The calculation of the summand is followed by the increment. For example, for "++a", during the calculation, a is increased by 1, then multiplied by the coefficient. So, the a is increased by 1 as part of the summand's processing.

So, after processing a pre-increment summand, a is increased by 1 once. Because the increment is part of the summand's processing.

Similarly, for a post-increment summand: the value is computed first (using the current a), then a is increased by 1.

So, each summand's processing increases a by 1, but the timing of when it is increased differs between the types.

So, for a summand of type ++a:

Processing:

1. a +=1.

2. compute value as coeff * a.

3. a does not change after this computation.

No, no. The summand's processing is to compute the value (using the steps for the type), and then a is increased by 1 once.

Wait, no. The problem statement says:

"In the calculation of such sum in C*++ goes the following way. First all the summands are calculated one after another, then they are summed by the usual arithmetic rules. If the summand contains "a++", then during the calculation first the value of the "a" variable is multiplied by the coefficient, then value of "a" is increased by 1. If the summand contains "++a", then the actions on it are performed in the reverse order: first "a" is increased by 1, then — multiplied by the coefficient."

So, each summand's calculation involves:

For a++:

   compute value (coeff * a), then a increases by 1.

For ++a:

   a increases by 1, compute value (coeff * a), then a remains at that new value?

Yes. Because the summand's calculation is the act of determining its value, and during that calculation, a is modified.

So, for each summand:

- For a++: value is coeff*a, then a increments by 1.

- For ++a: a increments by 1, then value is coeff*a.

Thus, each summand's processing increases a by 1.

So, for a summand of type ++a:

When processed, a is increased by 1, then the value is computed, and the summand's processing is complete. But a is now at the increased value.

Yes. So, the key point is that each summand's processing increases a by 1, but the order of that increment and the value calculation depends on the type.

So, in sample input 2:

The summands are a++ and ++a.

Processing a++ first:

value is 3*1 =3. a becomes4.

Then, processing ++a:

a becomes5 (incremented by 1), value is1*5=5. a becomes5 (after processing, no further increment? Or does processing the summand's calculation also include an increment?

Wait, the summand's calculation for ++a is: a increases by 1, then value is computed. But then, after that, is a increased by 1 again?

No. Because the summand's calculation is part of the processing.

Wait, the problem statement says that each summand is calculated one after another, and during the calculation, the increment happens.

So, for a summand of type ++a:

During its calculation:

1. a is increased by 1.

2. value is computed as coeff * a.

Then, the summand's processing is done. a remains at the increased value.

No further increments.

So each summand's calculation increases a by 1.

For example:

Summand is a++:

a=3 → value=3*1=3. a becomes4.

Summand is ++a:

a=3 → a becomes4. value=4*1=4. a is4.

Wait, no. Because the summand's calculation for ++a is to increment a by 1, then compute the value. So a is increased by 1 during the calculation of the summand. So after processing this summand, a is 4.

But then, in sample input 2's note, processing the two summands in either order gives the same result.

Let me re-express the sample input 2:

Initial a=3.

Summand1: a++ (coefficient 1, sign +).

Summand2: ++a (coefficient 1, sign +).

Processing order 1: summand1 first.

Summand1's processing:

value is 3*1=3. a becomes4.

Summand2's processing:

a is increased by 1 →5. value is 1*5=5. a becomes5.

Total sum is 3+5=8. a is5.

Processing order 2: summand2 first.

Summand2's processing:

a is increased by 1 →4. value is1*4=4. a becomes4.

Summand1's processing:

value is4*1=4. a becomes5.

Total sum is4+4=8.

So regardless of order, the sum is 8, which matches the sample output.

But according to our sorting approach, the two summands have s_i*c_i = 1*1=1 and 1*1=1. So their order is irrelevant, and the code would process them in any order. Thus, the sum is 8 in either case.

So the approach works.

Now, back to the parsing of the summands. For the sample input 2, the expression is 'a+++++a'. How is this split into summands?

The expression is 'a+++++a'.

Let's split the expression into summands based on '+' and '-'.

The first summand is 'a++', followed by '+', then '++a'.

But how? The expression 'a+++++a' can be split into 'a++' + '++a'.

But how?

The first 'a' is followed by '++', which is part of a++.

Then, the next '+' is the operator. The remaining part is '++a'.

So summands are:

Summand1: 'a++' (sign +).

Summand2: '++a' (sign +).

So during parsing, the code would split the expression into summands with signs.

So, the code must correctly split the expression into summands.

Now, the code's parsing steps are:

1. Split the expression into summands with their signs.

The first summand has a positive sign.

The code can split the expression by the operators '+' and '-', but the operators can be part of the summand (like '++a').

So, the splitting must be done in a way that the operators that separate summands are the ones that are not part of an increment.

But how?

This is the most challenging part of the problem. The correct splitting of the expression into summands.

An alternative approach is to iterate through the expression and track when we are inside a summand.

But this is complex.

Alternatively, regular expressions can be used to find the summands.

The regular expression for a summand can be:

([+-]?)(\d*\*?(?:a\+\+|\+\+a))

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we can split the expression into summands by looking for the '+' and '-' operators that are not part of an increment.

But how to do that.

The summands can start with either a coefficient (digits followed by *), or an increment (++a or a++).

The operators that separate summands are '+' or '-' that are not part of an increment.

So, for example, in 'a+++a', the first '++' is part of a++ and the third '+' is the operator.

But 'a+++a' can be parsed as a++ +a.

But in that case, the second summand is 'a', which is an increment of type a++, but without the '++'.

This is invalid, but according to the problem statement, the input is valid.

Thus, the code can rely on the input being correctly formatted, and the summands are well-formed.

Thus, the code can split the expression into summands by looking for '+' and '-' operators that are not part of an increment.

But how to do that.

Another approach is to split the expression into summands by '+' and '-', but only when the '+' or '-' is not followed by '+' or 'a'.

But this might not be reliable.

Alternatively, we can iterate through the string and split summands as follows:

- The first summand starts at index 0.

- After that, whenever a '+' or '-' is found that is not part of an increment, it marks the start of a new summand.

But how to detect if a '+' is part of an increment.

For example, in '++a', the '+' is part of the increment.

In 'a++', the '+' is part of the increment.

In 'a+++b', the first two '+' are part of 'a++', and the third '+' is an operator.

But this is not a valid summand, as 'b' is not part of the increment.

But the input is guaranteed to be valid, so this situation won't occur.

So, the approach is:

Loop through the expression to find the split points.

Start at index 0.

For each character in the expression:

   if the current character is '+' or '-', then check if it's part of an increment or a summand separator.

But this is difficult.

Alternatively, we can split the expression into summands by splitting on '+' and '-' that are followed by a digit or 'a'.

Wait, perhaps the following approach:

The summands are separated by '+' or '-' that are followed by either a digit or 'a'.

So, for example, in 'a+++a', the '+' that is followed by 'a' is a summand separator.

But in '++a', the '+' is part of the increment.

So, the code can split the expression using a regular expression that matches '+' or '-' that are followed by a digit or 'a'.

The regular expression can be [+-](?=[0-9a])

But this may not capture all cases.

Alternatively, use look-behind and look-ahead.

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps the best approach is to manually parse the summands.

Here's the plan:

1. The first summand starts at position 0.

2. Iterate through the string to find the end of each summand and the start of the next.

3. For each position i:

   if the character is '+' or '-', check if it's part of an increment or a summand separator.

But how?

Alternatively, when a '+' or '-' is encountered, check if the previous characters form part of an increment.

For example:

In 'a+++a', after 'a++', the next '+' is a summand separator.

But how to detect that.

Alternatively, the code can iterate through the string and split into summands as follows:

Initialize a list of summands and their signs.

The first summand starts at index 0, with a sign of +1.

Then, iterate through the string looking for '+' or '-'. Each such character is considered a sign for the next summand, unless it is part of an increment.

Wait, but increments can be 'a++' or '++a'.

So, 'a++' ends with two '+'.

If the code encounters a '+', it checks if the previous characters are part of 'a++' or '++a'.

Alternatively, when parsing the current summand, the code can track whether the current position is inside an increment.

But this requires parsing the summands.

This seems to be the crux of the problem.

An alternative approach is to split the expression into summands by checking where the summands end.

Each summand can end with either 'a++' or '++a', but this is not necessarily true because the summand can have a coefficient.

For example, '5*a++' is a summand.

So, the summand ends with 'a++'.

Thus, the code can split the string into summands by finding the 'a++' or '++a' parts, and then look for the '+' or '-' after them.

So, the steps can be:

1. Iterate through the string and split into summands.

2. For each summand:

   a. Find the end of the summand by locating 'a++' or '++a'.

   b. The summand's text is from the start to the end of the increment.

   c. The next operator (if any) is the sign for the next summand.

For example:

In 'a+++++a', the first summand is 'a++', then the next operator is '+', followed by the summand '++a'.

But how to find the end of the summand.

So, the code can look for occurrences of 'a++' or '++a' in the string.

Each summand must end with one of these two patterns.

Thus, the code can split the string into summands by finding these patterns.

But this is complex.

Alternatively, use a regular expression to match summands, and split the string accordingly.

The regular expression for a summand could be:

(\d+\*)?(a\+\+|\+\+a)

But this would match a summand that starts with optional digits and a '*', followed by 'a++' or '++a'.

But the coefficient can also be omitted, which would make the regex look like:

(\d*\*?)?(a\+\+|\+\+a)

But this may not work for summands like 'a++'.

But given the problem's constraints, perhaps the following regex can be used:

r'(\d*\*?)?(a\+\+|\+\+a)'

This regex matches a summand, which is optionally a coefficient (digits, possibly empty), followed by a '*' (optional), followed by 'a++' or '++a'.

But in reality, the coefficient can't be empty when the '*' is present.

But according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so we can assume that summands are correctly formatted.

So, using this regex, we can find all summands in the expression.

But how to split the entire expression into summands.

The code can use re.findall to find all summands, but this would leave out the operators between them.

But the summands are separated by '+' or '-'.

Thus, the code can split the expression into summands and operators.

Alternatively, use a regex to find all summands and the operators between them.

For example:

The regex can be:

([+-]?)(\d*\*?(?:a\+\+|\+\+a))

But this may not work for the first summand.

Alternatively, use the regex to split the expression into tokens, each being a summand with its sign.

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps the best approach is to manually parse the expression.

Here's a plan:

1. Initialize the list of summands.

2. The first summand starts at position 0.

3. The sign of the first summand is '+'.

4. Iterate through the string, find the end of the current summand.

5. For the current position, find the next occurrence of 'a++' or '++a'.

6. Once the summand is parsed, the next operator is either '+' or '-', which determines the sign of the next summand.

But how to find the end of a summand.

Alternatively, the code can parse summands by first parsing the coefficient (if any), then the increment.

But this requires knowing where the coefficient ends and the increment begins.

So, for each summand:

1. The coefficient is optional. It may start with digits, followed by a '*'.

2. The increment is 'a++' or '++a'.

Thus, the code can parse each summand as follows:

Starting from the current position:

- Read digits until a '*' is found (this is the coefficient).

- Then, read the increment (either 'a++' or '++a').

- If no '*' is found, then check if the current position starts with 'a++' or '++a'.

This seems manageable.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Parsing summands from the expression:

expression = input().strip()

summands = []

current_pos = 0

sign = 1  # first summand has implicit '+'

while current_pos < len(expression):

   # Determine the sign of the next summand

   if current_pos ==0:

       # first summand

       pass

   else:

       # check current character

       if expression[current_pos] == '+':

           sign = 1

           current_pos +=1

       elif expression[current_pos] == '-':

           sign = -1

           current_pos +=1

       else:

           # sign is positive, but this can't happen as per problem statement

           pass

   # parse the current summand

   # read coefficient and increment

   # find the increment part (a++ or ++a)

   # search for 'a++' or '++a' starting from current_pos

   increment_pos = current_pos

   increment_type = None

   while increment_pos < len(expression):

       if expression.startswith('a++', increment_pos):

           increment_type = 'post'

           increment_pos +=3

           break

       elif expression.startswith('++a', increment_pos):

           increment_type = 'pre'

           increment_pos +=3

           break

       increment_pos +=1

   if increment_type is None:

       # invalid, but input is valid

       pass

   # increment_pos now is the end of the increment part.

   # the coefficient part is from current_pos to the start of the increment part.

   coeff_part = expression[current_pos : increment_pos -3]

   # but the increment starts at increment_pos-3.

   # Wait, for example, if the increment starts at position 5, then the increment part is 3 characters.

   # the coeff_part is from current_pos to position (increment_pos -3).

   # parse the coefficient

   if '*' in coeff_part:

       coeff_str = coeff_part.split('*')[0]

       if coeff_str == '':

           coefficient = 1

       else:

           coefficient = int(coeff_str)

   else:

       # coeff_part is either empty or digits.

       if coeff_part == '':

           coefficient =1

       else:

           # check if coeff_part is digits

           if coeff_part.isdigit():

               coefficient = int(coeff_part)

           else:

               # invalid, but input is valid.

               coefficient =1

   summands.append( (sign, coefficient, increment_type) )

   current_pos = increment_pos

This code assumes that the summands are correctly formatted, and the increment is always found.

But this is a bit complex.

Alternatively, for the parsing, the code can split the summands by the '+' and '-' operators, but then for each summand part, parse the coefficient and increment.

But this approach would split on any '+' or '-', even those that are part of an increment.

Thus, this approach would not work.

Thus, the correct way is to parse the summands by finding their increments and coefficients.

Once the summands are parsed correctly, the rest is straightforward.

Thus, the code for parsing is the most challenging part.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can proceed as follows.

Another approach to parse the summands:

Use the re library to find all occurrences of the summands.

The regular expression can be:

([+-]?)(\d*\*?)(a\+\+|\+\+a)

But this may not capture all cases.

Alternatively, use re.finditer to find all summands.

But the code must account for the signs.

Thus, the code can be:

import re

pattern = r'([+-])?(\d*\*?)?(a\+\+|\+\+a)'

But this may not work correctly.

Alternatively, use the following steps:

Split the expression into tokens of summands and signs.

The first summand has no sign, then each subsequent summand has a sign.

But how to split the expression into summands and signs.

The code can split the expression into tokens using the regular expression r'([+-])', but then the first token is the first summand, and the rest are sign-summand pairs.

For example, for the expression '5*a++-3*++a+a++', the split on [+-] would give ['5*a++', '-', '3*++a', '+', 'a++'].

Then, the summands are:

summand1: '5*a++', sign '+'.

summand2: '3*++a', sign '-'.

summand3: 'a++', sign '+'.

This approach works.

Thus, the code can split the expression into parts using the regular expression r'([+-])', then the first part is the first summand, and the remaining parts are sign-summand pairs.

Thus:

import re

expression = input().strip()

parts = re.split(r'([+-])', expression)

summands = []

current_sign = 1

summands.append( (current_sign, parts[0]) )

for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):

   sign = parts[i]

   summand = parts[i+1]

   current_sign = 1 if sign == '+' else -1

   summands.append( (current_sign, summand) )

This way, summands is a list of tuples (sign, summand_str).

For example, '5*a++-3*++a+a++' is split into:

parts = ['5*a++', '-', '3*++a', '+', 'a++']

summands would be:

[ (1, '5*a++'), (-1, '3*++a'), (1, 'a++') ]

This is correct.

Thus, this code can split the summands into their respective parts with their signs.

Then, each summand_str can be parsed into coefficient and increment.

So for each summand_str in summands:

If '*' is present:

   coeff_part, incr_part = summand_str.split('*', 1)

   coefficient = int(coeff_part)

   increment_type = 'post' if incr_part == 'a++' else 'pre'

else:

   if summand_str starts with 'a++' or '++a':

       coefficient = 1

       increment_type = 'post' if summand_str == 'a++' else 'pre'

   else:

       # invalid, but input is valid.

Thus, the parsing code can proceed.

Putting it all together:

Now, the code can be written as follows:

Read a and the expression.

Parse the expression into summands with their signs.

For each summand:

   parse coefficient and increment type.

Compute s_i * c_i.

Sort the summands in ascending order of s_i * c_i.

Process the summands in this order, accumulating the total.

Now, the code:

Read a:

a = int(input())

expression = input().strip()

Parse the summands:

parts = re.split(r'([+-])', expression)

summand_list = []

if not parts[0]:

   parts = parts[1:]

current_sign = 1

summand_list.append( (current_sign, parts[0]) )

for i in range(1, len(parts), 2):

   op = parts[i]

   summand_str = parts[i+1]

   current_sign = 1 if op == '+' else -1

   summand_list.append( (current_sign, summand_str) )

Now, parse each summand_str into coefficient and increment type.

summands = []

for sign, summand_str in summand_list:

   # parse summand_str

   if '*' in summand_str:

       coeff_part, incr_part = summand_str.split('*', 1)

   else:

       coeff_part = '1'

       incr_part = summand_str

   # handle cases where coeff_part is empty?

   # for example, if summand_str is '++a' and no coefficient

   if not coeff_part:

       coeff_part = '1'

   if incr_part not in ['a++', '++a']:

       # invalid, but input is valid

       pass

   coefficient = int(coeff_part)

   increment_type = 'post' if incr_part == 'a++' else 'pre'

   summands.append( (sign, coefficient, increment_type) )

Now, sort the summands based on s_i * c_i.

summands.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] * x[1])

Now, process the summands:

total = 0

current_a = a

for sign, coeff, incr_type in summands:

   if incr_type == 'post':

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a

   else:

       contribution = sign * coeff * (current_a + 1)

   total += contribution

   current_a += 1

print(total)

Wait, but in the case of a pre-increment summand, the a is increased by 1 before computing the contribution. But according to the problem statement, for a pre-increment summand, during calculation, a is increased by 1, then the value is computed. Then, after processing the summand, a is increased by 1 again?

No. The problem statement says that during the calculation of the summand:

For ++a, a is increased by 1, then multiplied by the coefficient. So, a is increased by 1 as part of the summand's processing, and then there is no further increment. Wait, no. Because each summand's processing increases a by 1 once.

Wait, no. For a pre-increment summand:

- During calculation, a is increased by 1.

- The value is computed as coeff * a (now increased).

- Then, a is increased by 1 again.

But that can't be right.

Wait, according to the problem statement:

Each summand is calculated in the order specified. For a summand of type ++a:

1. a is increased by 1.

2. The value is computed as coeff * a.

Then, after the summand's calculation, a is increased by 1 again?

No, that would mean each summand increases a by 2 for pre-increment and 1 for post-increment. But the problem statement's first sample shows that after processing three summands, a is increased by 3.

Sample 1's initial a is 1.

After processing summand2 (pre-increment), a becomes 2.

Then summand3 (post-increment): a becomes 3.

Then summand1 (post-increment): a becomes4.

So, each summand increases a by 1, regardless of type.

Thus, the code's processing of incrementing a by 1 after each summand is correct.

But according to the problem statement, the processing of a pre-increment summand increases a by 1 during the calculation (before computing the value), and then again after the summand is processed.

No. That can't be the case.

Let me re-express the problem statement's rules.

For summands:

- a++:

   value = coeff * a.

   a +=1.

- ++a:

   a +=1.

   value = coeff * a.

   a +=1.

No, this would mean that for a pre-increment summand, a increases by 2. But the sample indicates that this is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement's description is that each summand's calculation includes the increment. For example:

For a++:

   value is computed as coeff * a.

   a is increased by 1.

For ++a:

   a is increased by 1.

   value is computed as coeff * a.

   a is not increased again.

Thus, each summand's processing increases a by 1.

Thus, the code's current approach (incrementing a by 1 after processing each summand) is incorrect.

Because in the case of a pre-increment summand, a is increased by 1 during the calculation (before computing the value), and then the code adds another 1. So, a total of 2 increments per pre-increment summand.

But according to the sample input 2:

Processing a pre-increment summand:

initial a=3.

summand is ++a.

Processing:

a increases by 1 (to4) during the calculation.

value is 1 *4.

then, the code adds 1 to a (to5).

But according to the sample input's note, processing this summand first:

a becomes 4 (during calculation), then a increases by 1 (code's step) → a becomes5.

But in the sample, when processing summand2 (++a) first:

a becomes4 (during calculation), code increases to5.

Then, summand1 (a++) is processed:

value is5 *1 =5. a becomes6.

Total sum is4+5=9, but the sample output is8.

This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

Ah, this is a problem.

So, the code's current approach is incorrect.

What's the mistake?

In the code, after computing the contribution of the summand, the code increments a by 1.

But according to the problem statement:

For a++ summand:

   value is computed as coeff * a.

   a is increased by 1.

For ++a summand:

   a is increased by 1.

   value is computed as coeff * a.

Thus, during the processing of a summand, a is increased by 1.

Thus, the code should not increment a after the summand's processing.

Because the summand's processing already includes the increment.

For example, for a post-increment summand:

current_a = a.

value = coeff * current_a.

a becomes current_a +1.

For a pre-increment summand:

current_a = a.

a becomes current_a +1.

value = coeff * (current_a +1).

Thus, after processing either summand, a is increased by 1.

Thus, in code, the a is updated during the processing of the summand.

Thus, the code's current approach (adding 1 to a after processing each summand) is incorrect.

This is a critical mistake.

So, the code must be modified to increment a during the processing of each summand.

Thus, the code should be:

for each summand in sorted order:

   if post:

       contribution = sign * coeff * a.

       a +=1.

   else:

       a +=1.

       contribution = sign * coeff * a.

Thus, the code should not increment a after each summand, but increment it during the processing of the summand.

But how to model this.

Thus, the code should process each summand as follows:

current_a = initial_a.

for summand in sorted_summands:

   if summand is post:

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a.

       current_a += 1.

   else:

       current_a += 1.

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a.

   total += contribution.

Thus, the code must increment a during the processing of the summand.

This changes everything.

Thus, the code's approach to increment a after each summand is incorrect.

This is the key mistake in the initial approach.

Thus, the code must be modified to increment a during processing, not after.

So, the code's processing loop is:

current_a = a

total =0

for sign, coeff, incr_type in sorted_summands:

   if incr_type == 'post':

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a

       current_a +=1

   else:

       current_a +=1

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a

   total += contribution

Thus, this correctly models the problem statement's rules.

Let's test this with the first sample.

Sample input 1:

a=1.

summands are:

summand2 (sorted first): sign -1, coeff3, pre.

summand3: sign +1, coeff1, post.

summand1: sign +1, coeff5, post.

Processing order: summand2, summand3, summand1.

Processing summand2 (pre):

current_a starts at 1.

incr_type is pre:

current_a +=1 → 2.

contribution = -1 *3*2 =-6.

total is-6.

current_a is 2.

Processing summand3 (post):

contribution =1 *1 *2 =2.

current_a becomes3.

total is-6+2=-4.

Processing summand1 (post):

contribution =1 *5 *3 =15.

current_a becomes4.

total is-4+15=11.

Which matches the sample output.

Sample input 2:

a=3.

summands are:

summand1: a++, sign +1, coeff1, post.

summand2: ++a, sign+1, coeff1, pre.

Their s*c is 1 and 1, so order can be either.

Processing summand1 first:

current_a =3.

contribution =1 *1 *3=3. current_a becomes4.

summand2:

current_a +=1 →5. contribution=1 *5=5. current_a remains5.

total=3+5=8.

Processing summand2 first:

current_a =3.

summand2 is pre:

current_a +=1 →4. contribution=1 *4=4. current_a is4.

summand1:

contribution=1 *1 *4=4. current_a becomes5.

total=4+4=8.

Which matches the sample output.

Thus, the code must be adjusted to increment a during the summand's processing.

This changes the code's processing loop.

Thus, the code's processing loop is corrected as:

current_a = a

total = 0

for sign, coeff, incr_type in sorted_summands:

   if incr_type == 'post':

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a

       current_a +=1

   else:

       current_a +=1

       contribution = sign * coeff * current_a

   total += contribution

Thus, this code correctly models the summand processing.

Thus, the code must be adjusted to reflect this.

Thus, the final code should:

- Read a and the expression.

- Parse the summands into a list of tuples (sign, coeff, type).

- Sort the summands in ascending order of (sign * coeff).

- Process the summands in this order, updating current_a and the total contribution as per the type.

Thus, the code is now correct.
