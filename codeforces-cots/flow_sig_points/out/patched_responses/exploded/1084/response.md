<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to compare two numbers written in the golden system. The golden system uses base q, where q is (sqrt(5)+1)/2. The value of a string is the sum of each digit multiplied by q^(n-i), where i is the position. So for example, the string "a0 a1 ... an" has a0 * q^n + a1 * q^(n-1) + ... + an * q^0.

The problem is to determine which of the two given strings is larger in value. But calculating their actual decimal values directly might not be feasible because q is irrational and for very long strings (up to 1e5 characters), that's going to be computationally expensive and lose precision.

Hmm. So what's the trick here? Let's think about the properties of q. Since q^2 = q + 1, maybe we can represent the value in terms of coefficients of q and 1. Because each power of q can be expressed using lower powers. For example, q^2 is q+1, q^3 is q^2 + q = (q+1) + q = 2q +1, and so on. So maybe the value can be represented as a pair (a, b) where the total is a*q + b. Then, when processing each digit, we can update this pair.

Wait, let's think: Each digit contributes a_i * q^k. So when building the value from left to right (since the leftmost digit is multiplied by the highest power of q), perhaps we can represent the current value as a combination of q and 1. Let me see.

Let's model the value as a linear combination of q and 1. For example, suppose after processing some digits, the current value is x*q + y. Then, when we process the next digit (either 0 or 1), we multiply by q (since each next digit is a higher power) and add the digit's value (since the digit is multiplied by q^m, and after processing the previous digits, which were up to q^{m-1}, multiplying by q gives q^m).

Wait, let's process the digits from left to right. Let's say the string is a_0 a_1 ... a_n. The value is sum_{i=0 to n} a_i * q^{n - i} = a_0 q^n + a_1 q^{n-1} + ... + a_n q^0.

If we process the digits from left to right, then each step is: current_value = current_value * q + digit. But since q^2 = q + 1, each multiplication by q can be represented in terms of the previous coefficients.

So, for example, if current_value is a*q + b, then multiplying by q gives a*q^2 + b*q = a*(q+1) + b*q = (a + b) * q + a*1. So the new a' is (a + b), and the new b' is a.

Then, adding a digit (0 or 1) would add that digit to the current value. So, for each step:

After multiplying by q, the coefficients become (a + b, a). Then, adding the digit d (0 or 1) would add d to the b term (since the current value is a'*q + b', and adding d would make it a'*q + (b' + d)).

Wait, no. Wait, the processing steps would be:

Initially, current_value is 0. Then, for each digit in the string (from left to right):

current_value = current_value * q + digit.

But since current_value is a linear combination of q and 1, we can model it with coefficients (a, b) where current_value = a*q + b.

Multiplying by q gives a*q^2 + b*q = a*(q +1) + b*q = (a + b) q + a. Then adding the digit d (0 or 1) gives (a + b) q + (a + d).

So the recurrence is:

a_new = a_prev + b_prev

b_new = a_prev + d

Wait, because:

After multiplying by q: (a + b) q + a

Then adding d: (a + b) q + (a + d)

So the new a is (a_prev + b_prev), and the new b is (a_prev + d).

Yes. So the process is:

Start with a = 0, b = 0. Then for each digit d in the string:

a, b = (a + b), (a) + d

Wait, no. Wait, after processing each digit, the current value is (previous value * q) + d. So the previous value is (a, b) = a*q + b. Then multiplying by q gives (a*q + b) * q = a*q² + b*q = a*(q+1) + b*q = a*q + a + b*q. But q² is q+1, so that's correct.

But when you multiply (a*q + b) by q, you get a*q² + b*q = a*(q+1) + b*q = (a + b)*q + a*1. Then adding d (the current digit) gives (a + b)*q + (a + d). So the new a becomes (a_prev + b_prev), and the new b becomes (a_prev + d).

So for each step:

new_a = a_prev + b_prev

new_b = a_prev + d

So that's how the coefficients evolve.

Therefore, processing each digit in the string, left to right, we can track a and b. At the end, the value is a * q + b.

But how do we compare two such values, (a1*q + b1) and (a2*q + b2)?

Because q is irrational, the equality can only happen if a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. Otherwise, the difference between the two is (a1 -a2)*q + (b1 -b2). Since q is irrational, this can only be zero if (a1 -a2) and (b1 -b2) are both zero. So for equality, a1 must equal a2 and b1 must equal b2.

So, for the two numbers, we can compute their (a, b) pairs. Then compare them.

But how to compare (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) when they are not equal?

We need to compute the sign of (a1*q + b1) - (a2*q + b2) = (a1 -a2)*q + (b1 -b2). Let's call this delta = A*q + B, where A = a1 -a2 and B = b1 -b2.

We need to determine whether delta is positive, negative, or zero.

Since q is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 ≈ 1.618, it's positive.

If delta is zero, then the numbers are equal.

Otherwise, let's find the sign of A*q + B.

If A is positive and B is positive, then delta is positive.

But if A is positive and B is negative, it's possible that A*q + B is negative. Wait, but q is irrational, so how can we find the sign?

Alternatively, we can note that since q² = q +1, we can express the delta in terms of q.

Alternatively, let's square delta if necessary. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since delta is A*q + B, and q is positive, the sign depends on A and B.

Let me think: Let's suppose that A and B are not both zero. Then, the sign of delta is the same as the sign of (A*q + B). But how can we determine this without calculating q?

We can rearrange:

delta = A*q + B.

But q is (sqrt(5) +1)/2, which is approximately 1.618. So if we can compute the value of A*q + B, but how?

Alternatively, note that since q² = q +1, perhaps we can find a relation between A and B.

Let me see:

Assume delta = A*q + B.

If we multiply both sides by (q - 1), since q is positive and not 1, this doesn't change the sign.

delta * (q - 1) = A*q*(q-1) + B*(q-1).

But q -1 is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 - 2/2 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ 0.618. So positive.

So the sign of delta is the same as the sign of delta*(q-1).

But let's compute delta*(q-1):

= (A q + B)(q -1)
= A q (q -1) + B (q -1)
= A (q² - q) + B (q -1)
But q² = q +1, so q² - q = (q+1) - q =1.
So this becomes A*1 + B (q -1)
= A + B (q -1)

So delta's sign is same as A + B(q-1).

But since (q-1) is (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ 0.618, which is (sqrt(5) -1)/2 = 0.618...

But how can we compute this expression without knowing q's exact value?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to compare A q + B with 0 using algebraic manipulations.

Let me rearrange the equation A q + B =0.

A q = -B

q = -B/A

But since q is a specific irrational number, this equality holds only if A and B are zero or when -B/A equals q. But since q is irrational, this is possible only if A and B are such that their ratio is exactly -q, but since A and B are integers (as they are computed by adding integers step by step), this can't happen unless A and B are both zero.

Wait, no. Because A and B are the differences between two pairs of a and b coefficients, which are computed by processing the digits. Let's see how a and b are computed.

At each step, a and b are integers. Because the digits are 0 or 1, and the initial a and b are 0. Each step:

new_a = a_prev + b_prev

new_b = a_prev + d (d is 0 or 1)

So, new_a and new_b are integers. So for each string, a and b are integers. Therefore, A and B are integers (a1 -a2 and b1 -b2 are integers).

So, delta = A*q + B. If A and B are not both zero, then delta can't be zero unless the ratio is -B/A = q, but q is irrational and -B/A is rational. So the only way delta is zero is if A=0 and B=0.

Therefore, if after processing both strings, the (a, b) pairs are equal, then output "=". Otherwise, we need to determine the sign of delta = A*q + B.

But how?

We can compute delta squared, but let's see:

delta^2 = (A q + B)^2 = A² q² + 2AB q + B².

But q² is q +1, so substitute:

= A² (q +1) + 2AB q + B²

= (A² + 2AB) q + (A² + B²)

Then, delta^2 is (A² + 2AB) q + (A² + B²)

But delta^2 is positive if delta is non-zero. So this might not help.

Alternatively, since q is approximately 1.618, we can compute the value of A * 1.618 + B and compare to zero. But for very large A and B (like when the strings are 1e5 digits long), this could lead to floating-point inaccuracies. So that's not reliable.

Hmm. So how else can we compare A*q + B and 0?

Let me think about the possible cases.

Case 1: A = 0. Then delta is B. So if B is positive, delta is positive. If B is negative, delta is negative.

Case 2: A > 0.

Then, delta = A q + B. So for delta to be positive, A q + B > 0. Which is equivalent to B > -A q.

But since q is irrational, we can't compute that directly. But perhaps we can find a way to compare B and -A q.

Alternatively, rearrange the inequality:

A q + B >0 → B > -A q.

But multiply both sides by (q-1), which is positive. So the inequality remains the same:

B (q-1) > -A q (q-1).

But q (q-1) is q² - q. Since q² = q+1, q² - q = 1. So:

B (q-1) > -A *1.

So, B (q-1) + A >0.

But q-1 is (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈ 0.618. So:

B * 0.618 + A >0.

But how can we compute this without floating-point operations?

Alternatively, note that (sqrt(5)-1)/2 is the same as 1/(q). Because q is (sqrt(5)+1)/2. Then, q * (sqrt(5)-1)/2 = [(sqrt(5)+1)/2] * [(sqrt(5)-1)/2] = (5-1)/4 = 1. So (sqrt(5)-1)/2 = 1/q.

So q-1 = 1/q.

So B*(1/q) + A >0 → (B + A q) / q >0 → since q is positive, this is equivalent to B + A q >0.

Wait, but this is delta = A q + B. So (B + A q) is the same as delta. Which brings us back to the original problem.

Hmm. This seems to be a loop.

Alternative approach: since q is a root of x² = x + 1, perhaps we can use this equation to find a way to compare A q + B with 0.

Let me suppose that A is positive (if A is zero, we already handled that case). So A >0.

We need to check if A q + B >0. Let's express q in terms of its equation. q = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 ≈ 1.618. So, q is approximately 1.618.

But how to find the sign without using floating points?

Wait, another idea: since q > 1 and q^2 = q +1, perhaps we can find an inequality that relates A and B.

For example, if A and B are such that B >= -A*1.618... then delta is positive. But since we can't compute that exactly, perhaps we can find a way to express this in terms of integers.

Alternatively, note that delta = A q + B. Let's square both sides (since delta is real, but the sign can be determined by other means).

Wait, but delta is positive if and only if delta >0, so squaring may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that the sign of delta is the same as the sign of A multiplied by (q + B/A), but that also requires knowing the sign of (q + B/A).

Alternatively, note that for A positive:

delta >0 → q > -B/A.

But q is approximately 1.618. So if -B/A < q, then delta is positive. But how to compare -B/A and q without knowing the exact value?

Wait, but q is the positive solution to x² =x +1. So, for example, if we have some inequality involving x, we can substitute x² =x+1.

Alternatively, let's write:

We want to know if q > (-B)/A.

Since q is the solution to q^2 = q +1, perhaps we can find that.

Suppose we have some x, and we want to see whether x < q.

We can write x² < x +1 → x² -x -1 <0. The roots of x² -x -1 are q and (1 - sqrt(5))/2. So the inequality x² -x -1 <0 holds when x is between the roots, which is between (1-sqrt(5))/2 (approx -0.618) and q. Since q is positive, if x is positive and x² <x +1, then x < q.

Wait, let's see: q is (1+sqrt(5))/2 ≈1.618. The other root is (1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈-0.618. So the quadratic x² -x -1 is positive when x> q or x < (1 - sqrt(5))/2. So for x positive, x² <x+1 → x <q.

So, if we can check if (-B/A)^2 < (-B/A) +1, then that would imply that (-B/A) < q, hence delta = A q + B >0.

But we can compute (-B/A)^2 < (-B/A) +1.

Multiply both sides by A² (since A is positive):

(-B)^2 < (-B) A + A².

Which is B² < -BA + A².

Rearranged as B² + BA -A² <0.

But B and A are integers.

So the inequality B² + BA -A² <0 can be computed exactly.

If this inequality holds, then (-B/A) < q → delta = A q + B >0.

Otherwise, if B² + BA -A² >=0, then (-B/A) >= q → delta =A q + B <=0.

Wait, but this is only valid when A is positive. Let's check:

If A is positive, then delta >0 is equivalent to q > -B/A.

As per the quadratic, if (-B/A)^2 < (-B/A) +1, then q is larger than (-B/A), so delta is positive. Otherwise, q <= (-B/A), so delta is negative or zero. But since delta can't be zero unless A and B are zero, which we already checked, so if the inequality is true, delta is positive. Otherwise, delta is negative.

So for A>0:

delta >0 if and only if B² + BA -A² <0.

Similarly, for A <0:

Then delta = A q + B. Since A is negative, delta is positive if q < (-B)/A.

But q is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 ≈1.618. So in this case, (-B)/A is positive (since A is negative and B can be positive or negative). For example, if A is -2 and B is 3, then (-B)/A = 3/2=1.5. So q ≈1.618 is larger than that. So delta = (-2)q +3 = -2q +3. Let's compute that: 3 - 2*1.618 ≈3-3.236= -0.236, so delta is negative.

But according to the previous approach, we can check whether (x)^2 <x+1, where x is (-B)/A. But since A is negative, x is (-B)/A. Let's see:

delta >0 → A q + B >0 → q < (-B)/A.

But since A is negative, q < (-B)/A is equivalent to q * A > -B (because multiplying both sides by A reverses the inequality). But this is tricky.

Alternatively, when A is negative, we can multiply delta by -1 to make A positive.

Let's see: delta = A q + B = -( |A| q ) + B. So when A is negative, delta = B - |A| q.

So delta >0 → B > |A| q.

But how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the same approach applies, but the inequality is reversed.

Let me see:

For A <0, delta =A q + B. Let's set A' = -A (positive) and B' = -B. Then delta = -A' q - B' = -(A' q + B').

Wait, no. Wait, delta = A q + B. If A is negative, then delta = (A) q + B = (-A') q + B, where A' is positive. So delta = B - A' q.

We want to check if B -A' q >0 → B >A' q.

But how can we compare B and A' q?

Again, we can use the same approach as before. For B and A' (positive), check if B/A' > q. Which is equivalent to (B/A')^2 > (B/A') +1 → B²/(A')² > B/A' +1 → B² > B A' + A'² → B² -B A' -A'² >0.

If this is true, then B/A' > q → delta = B -A' q >0 → delta is positive.

So for the case when A <0:

delta >0 is equivalent to B² - B A' - A'^2 >0, where A' is |A|.

But A' is -A (since A is negative).

So for A <0:

delta = A q + B = B + A q = B - ( -A ) q.

So to check if delta is positive, we need to check if B > (-A) q.

Which is equivalent to (B)^2 > (-A) q (B) + (-A)^2 q² → but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, using the same approach as before, but for the case when A is negative.

So, when A is positive:

delta >0 → B² + B A -A² <0.

When A is negative:

delta >0 → B > (-A) q → B/(-A) > q → (B/(-A))² > (B/(-A)) +1 → B² / A² > (B -A)/ (-A) +1 → ?

Wait, maybe I should handle A <0 by flipping the signs.

Let me think for A <0:

We have delta = A q + B. Let's factor A as -A' where A' is positive.

Then delta = -A' q + B.

We want to check if -A' q + B >0 → B > A' q.

Now, to check if B > A' q, multiply both sides by (q-1), which is positive. So:

B (q-1) > A' q (q-1).

But q(q-1) = q² - q = (q+1) - q =1.

So the right-hand side is A' *1 = A'.

So the inequality becomes B (q-1) -A' >0.

But q-1 is 1/q.

So:

B (1/q) - A' >0 → (B - A' q)/q >0.

But since q is positive, this is equivalent to B -A' q >0 → which is the original condition. So this approach doesn't help.

Alternative approach: for the case when A is negative.

We can write B - A' q >0 → B/A' > q.

Again, since B and A' are integers (because A' is |A| and A is the difference between two a's which are integers), B/A' is a rational number. To compare it with q, which is irrational, we can use the quadratic approach.

So, (B/A') > q → (B/A')^2 > (B/A') +1 → B² > B A' + A'^2 → B² - B A' -A'^2 >0.

So, delta >0 (when A is negative) if and only if B² - B A' - A'^2 >0.

So putting it all together:

For the general case where A is not zero, the sign of delta is determined as follows:

- If A >0: check if B² + B A -A² <0. If yes, delta is positive. Else, delta is negative.

- If A <0: compute A' = -A (A' is positive), check if B² - B A' -A'^2 >0. If yes, delta is positive. Else, delta is negative.

- If A is zero: delta is B. If B is positive, delta positive. If B negative, delta negative. If B is zero, then equal.

So the steps for comparing are:

1. Compute (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) for the two strings.

2. Compute A = a1 -a2 and B = b1 -b2.

3. If A and B are zero, output "=".

4. Else:

   a. If A ==0: compare B. If B>0, output ">". Else, "<".

   b. Else if A >0:

      i. Compute C = B*B + B*A -A*A.

      ii. If C <0: output ">".

      iii. Else: output "<".

   c. Else (A <0):

      i. Compute A' = -A.

      ii. Compute C = B*B - B*A' - A'*A'.

      iii. If C >0: output ">".

      iv. Else: output "<".

So this gives a way to compare the two numbers without using floating points, by relying on the properties of q's equation.

Now, the problem is to compute (a, b) for each string.

So the first step is to process each string and compute their a and b.

But processing each string of up to 1e5 characters must be done efficiently.

The code to compute a and b is straightforward. For each digit in the string:

new_a = a + b

new_b = a + int(digit)

But we need to process the digits in the order they are given, from left to right. Wait, the leftmost digit is the highest power. For example, the string "1000" is a0 a1 a2 a3. The value is a0 q^3 + a1 q^2 + a2 q + a3 q^0.

When processing from left to right, the first digit is a0. So the initial a and b are 0. Then, each step:

current_value = (current_a + current_b) * q + (current_a + digit)

So processing each digit as left to right.

Wait, let's see:

For example, the string is '1', which is a single digit. So the value is 1 * q^0 =1. Processing it:

Initially, a=0, b=0.

First digit is '1':

new_a = a + b =0+0=0

new_b = a + 1 =0 +1=1.

So after processing the first (and only) digit, a=0, b=1. So the value is 0*q +1=1. Correct.

Another example: the string is '10'. The value is 1*q + 0.

Processing:

Initial a=0, b=0.

First digit is '1':

new_a =0+0=0

new_b =0 +1=1.

Now, a=0, b=1.

Next digit is '0':

new_a =0 +1=1

new_b =0 +0=0.

Final a=1, b=0. So value is 1*q +0 = q. Correct.

Yes, so the code for processing each string is:

a, b = 0, 0

for c in s:

    d = int(c)

    new_a = a + b

    new_b = a + d

    a, b = new_a, new_b

So after processing each digit, we get a and b.

Now, the code steps:

Read the two strings.

Compute a1, b1 for the first string.

Compute a2, b2 for the second string.

Compute A = a1 -a2, B = b1 -b2.

If A ==0 and B ==0: output "=".

Else:

If A ==0: compare B and output.

Else if A>0:

compute C = B*B + B*A - A*A.

if C <0: output ">"

else: output "<"

Else (A <0):

A_abs = -A

C = B*B - B*A_abs - A_abs*A_abs

if C >0: output ">"

else: output "<"

This seems manageable.

Now, let's test this logic against the examples.

First example:

Input:

1000

111

Processing first string '1000':

Let's compute a and b step by step.

s = '1', '0', '0', '0'.

Step 1: digit '1':

a=0, b=0 → new_a =0+0=0, new_b=0+1=1. Now a=0, b=1.

Step 2: digit '0':

new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0+0=0. Now a=1, b=0.

Step3: digit '0':

new_a=1+0=1, new_b=1+0=1. Now a=1, b=1.

Step4: digit '0':

new_a=1+1=2, new_b=1 +0=1. Now a=2, b=1.

So for first string, a1=2, b1=1.

Second string '111':

Processing digits '1', '1', '1'.

Step1: digit '1' → new_a=0, new_b=0+1=1. a=0, b=1.

Step2: digit '1' → new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0 +1=1. a=1, b=1.

Step3: digit '1' → new_a=1+1=2, new_b=1 +1=2. a=2, b=2.

So a2=2, b2=2.

A = a1 -a2 = 2-2=0. B =1-2=-1.

Since A is 0, compare B. B is -1 <0. So output "<", which matches the first example.

Second example:

Input:

00100

11

First string '00100':

Process each digit:

Initial a=0, b=0.

Digits: 0,0,1,0,0.

Step1: 0 → new_a=0, new_b=0+0=0. a=0, b=0.

Step2: 0 → new_a=0+0=0, new_b=0+0=0. a=0, b=0.

Step3: 1 → new_a=0+0=0, new_b=0 +1=1. a=0, b=1.

Step4:0 → new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0 +0=0. a=1, b=0.

Step5:0 → new_a=1+0=1, new_b=1 +0=1. a=1, b=1.

So a1=1, b1=1.

Second string '11':

Digits:1,1.

Step1:1 → a=0, b=1.

Step2:1 → new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0+1=1. a=1, b=1.

So a2=1, b2=1. A=0, B=0. So output "=".

Third example:

Input:

110

101

First string '110':

Digits 1,1,0.

Step1:1 → a=0, b=1.

Step2:1 → new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0+1=1. a=1, b=1.

Step3:0 → new_a=1+1=2, new_b=1+0=1. a=2, b=1.

So a1=2, b1=1.

Second string '101':

Digits 1,0,1.

Step1:1 → a=0, b=1.

Step2:0 → new_a=0+1=1, new_b=0 +0=0. a=1, b=0.

Step3:1 → new_a=1+0=1, new_b=1 +1=2. a=1, b=2.

So a2=1, b2=2.

A=2-1=1, B=1-2=-1.

A is positive. Compute C = (-1)^2 + (-1)(1) -1^2 = 1 -1 -1= -1. C <0 → so delta is positive. So output ">", which matches the example.

Another test case: if two numbers have (a1=1, b1=3) and (a2=0, b2=0). Then A=1, B=3.

Compute C = 3² +3*1 -1² =9 +3 -1=11. 11 is not <0, so output "<".

Wait, but wait:

delta =1*q +3 - (0*q +0) = q +3. Since q is positive, delta is positive, but according to the code, C is 9+3 -1=11 ≥0 → output "<". But that's a mistake.

Wait, wait, this is a problem. So what's wrong here?

Wait, wait, wait. Let's recalculate.

Case where a1=1, b1=3, a2=0, b2=0. So A=1, B=3.

We compute C = B^2 + B*A -A^2 = 3² +3*1 -1² =9+3-1=11. Which is not less than zero. So according to code, output "<".

But delta is 1*q +3. Since q is positive, this is definitely positive. So the code's logic here is wrong.

This is a problem. So there's a mistake in the reasoning.

Hmm, this suggests that the approach is incorrect.

Wait, in this example, the code would output "<", but the actual delta is positive, so the correct output is ">".

So what's wrong with the logic?

Let's re-examine the approach.

In this example, A=1, B=3.

We compute C = B² + AB -A² = 9 +3*1 -1 = 11.

According to the code's logic, if C <0, then delta is positive. Else, delta is negative. But in this case, C is 11>0, so code outputs "<".

But delta is 1*q +3. Since q is positive, delta is definitely positive. So the code's logic is wrong here.

So the approach must be flawed. What's wrong here?

Ah, here's the mistake in the logic.

The condition B² + BA -A² <0 is supposed to indicate whether delta is positive.

But in this case, delta = A q + B = q +3.

Which is positive since q is positive. So the code's logic is wrong.

So why is the condition B² + BA -A² <0 not satisfied here?

Because in reality, delta is positive, but the code says to output "<".

This suggests that the logic is flawed. So what's wrong with the reasoning?

Let me re-express the condition.

The code says that for A>0, delta is positive iff B² + AB -A² <0.

But in this example, B² + AB -A² is 3² + 3*1 -1 =9+3-1=11>0. So the code says delta is negative. But in reality, delta is positive.

So the condition is incorrect.

So where's the mistake in the reasoning?

Let me re-express the earlier steps.

We have delta = A q + B. For A>0, we want to check if delta>0.

The code says that delta>0 is equivalent to B² + AB -A² <0.

But in this case, this is not the case.

So why?

Let me rederive the condition.

We have delta = A q + B.

We want to check if delta >0.

We know that q is the solution to q² = q +1.

We need to find the sign of delta.

So, delta = A q + B.

We can write:

A q + B >0 → q > -B/A (since A>0).

But since q is irrational, we need to find a way to compare q and -B/A using integer arithmetic.

The earlier approach used the quadratic equation. Let's see:

We have x = -B/A.

We want to check if q > x.

But q is the positive root of x² = x +1.

So, if x < q → x² < x +1.

Because for x between (1-sqrt(5))/2 and q, x² < x +1.

So, if x < q → x² <x+1.

But x is -B/A. So the condition is:

(-B/A) < q → (-B/A)^2 < (-B/A) +1.

Multiply both sides by A² (since A>0):

B² < (-B A) + A² → B² + BA -A² <0.

Yes.

But in this example, x is -3/1 =-3. So q is positive, x is -3. So q is greater than x. So delta is A q + B =1*q +3 → q +3, which is positive.

But according to the condition B² + AB -A² =9 +3 -1=11>0, so the condition is not satisfied. So according to the code's logic, delta is negative. Which is wrong.

Ah, here's the mistake. The code's logic is correct, but only when x is positive. Because when x is negative, q is larger than x, so delta is positive.

So the code's logic only applies when x is >= (1-sqrt(5))/2, which is about -0.618. But in this example, x is -3, which is less than (1-sqrt(5))/2, so x is in the region where x² >x +1.

Wait, no. Wait, the quadratic x² -x -1 <0 holds when x is between the roots (1-sqrt(5))/2 and (1+sqrt(5))/2. For x < (1-sqrt(5))/2, x² -x -1 is positive. For x between the roots, it's negative. For x> q, it's positive.

But in this example, x is -3. Let's compute x² -x -1:

(-3)^2 - (-3) -1 =9 +3 -1=11>0. So x is outside the interval. So x² -x -1>0 → x² >x+1 → x is not less than q. So according to the earlier logic, if x <q, then x² <x+1. If x is less than the lower root, then x² >x+1.

So when x is -3, which is less than (1-sqrt(5))/2, then x is in the region where x² -x-1>0 → x² >x+1. So the condition (-B/A) < q is equivalent to x < q. But x is -3, which is less than q. So q >x, so delta is positive. But the code's condition would not detect that, since B² + AB -A² is 9+3-1=11>0, leading the code to output '<' which is wrong.

So the code's logic is incorrect. It doesn't account for the case where x is less than (1-sqrt(5))/2.

So the problem is that the code's condition (B² + AB -A² <0) is only valid when x is in between (1-sqrt(5))/2 and q. If x is less than (1-sqrt(5))/2, then x < q is true, but x² >x+1 is also true, leading to the code's condition being false, but delta is positive.

So the code's logic is flawed.

So, the approach needs to be revised.

Hmm. So how to handle all possible cases?

Alternative approach: for A>0, delta is positive if and only if either:

1. x < (1-sqrt(5))/2 (which is approximately -0.618), which is always true when x is very negative. But since x is -B/A, and A is positive, this happens when B is positive (since x= -B/A, B positive makes x negative).

Wait, in this case, x is -3 (A=1, B=3). x= -3/1 = -3. Which is less than (1-sqrt(5))/2 (approx -0.618). So delta is positive, but the code's condition says to output '<'.

So the code's condition is not sufficient.

So the code's logic is missing this case.

So the problem is that the code's condition (B² + AB -A² <0) is only valid when x is in between the two roots of the quadratic. But when x is outside this interval (like x < lower root), the condition is false, but delta can still be positive.

So the code's logic is incorrect.

So how to correct this?

Let me re-express the original problem. For A>0, delta = A q + B. We need to determine if this is positive.

delta = A q + B = A (q + B/(A)) = A (q - (-B/A)).

But this isn't helpful.

Alternative approach: delta = A q + B.

If A>0:

We can split into cases based on the value of B.

Case 1: B >=0.

Then delta is A q + B >= A q >0. So output ">".

Wait, wait. If B is positive, then since A is positive, delta is definitely positive. But no: for example, A=1, B=-1. Then delta is q-1 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 -1 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈0.618, which is positive. But B is negative.

So that's not the case.

But in the example where B=3 and A=1, B is positive, so delta is q+3, which is obviously positive.

So when B is positive and A>0, delta is definitely positive.

But when B is negative?

For example, A=1, B=-1 → delta is q-1 = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 -1 = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 ≈0.618>0.

Another example: A=2, B=-5. delta=2q -5.

q is about 1.618. 2*1.618 is about 3.236. 3.236-5= -1.764 <0. So delta is negative.

So how to determine the sign.

So, for A>0 and B is positive: delta is positive.

For A>0 and B is negative: need to check.

But how.

So, the original code's condition is only applied when B is negative. Because if B is positive, then delta is positive.

So, perhaps the code should first check if B is positive or negative.

So, for A>0:

if B >=0: delta is positive.

else:

compute C = B² + AB -A².

if C <0: delta is positive.

else: delta is negative.

Yes! That makes sense.

Because when B is positive, delta is definitely positive.

Only when B is negative, we need to check.

So, the code's condition was missing this check.

So the correct approach for A>0 is:

if B >=0 → delta is positive.

else:

compute C = B² + AB -A².

if C <0 → delta is positive.

else → delta is negative.

So, the code should handle this.

Let's test this with the example where A=1, B=3.

B is positive → delta is positive → output ">".

In the case where A=1, B=-1 (B is negative):

Compute C = (-1)^2 + (1)(-1) -1^2 =1-1-1 =-1 <0 → delta is positive.

Which is correct, since delta is q-1 ≈0.618>0.

Another example where A=2, B=-5:

B is negative.

C = (-5)^2 + (2)(-5) -2^2 =25-10-4=11 >=0 → delta is negative.

Which is correct (2*1.618=3.236, 3.236-5= -1.764).

So the code's logic should be modified to first check if B is non-negative when A>0.

Similarly, for A<0.

So the revised steps are:

For general case:

Compute A = a1 -a2, B =b1 -b2.

If A and B are zero: output "=".

Else:

If A ==0:

   output ">" if B>0 else "<".

Else if A>0:

   if B >=0:

      output ">"

   else:

      compute C = B² + A*B -A².

      if C <0:

          output ">"

      else:

          output "<".

Else (A<0):

   if B <=0:

      output "<".

   else:

      compute A_abs = -A.

      compute C = B² - A_abs*B -A_abs².

      if C>0:

          output ">".

      else:

          output "<".

Let's see:

For A>0 and B >=0: output ">".

For A>0 and B <0: compute C.

For example, A=1, B=-3:

B is negative.

C = (-3)^2 + 1*(-3) -1^2 =9-3-1=5 ≥0 → output "<".

delta =1*q -3 = q-3 ≈1.618-3= -1.382 <0. So correct.

Another example: A=1, B=-1:

B is negative.

C= (-1)^2 +1*(-1) -1= 1-1-1= -1 <0 → output ">".

Which is correct (delta = q-1 ≈0.618>0).

For A<0:

Assume A is -2, B=3.

A is negative, B is positive.

So according to the code, B is positive → compute C.

A_abs=2.

C =3² - 2*3 -2²=9-6-4= -1 <=0 → output "<".

But delta is A q + B =-2q +3. q is about 1.618. -2*1.618+3=3-3.236= -0.236 → output "<", correct.

Another example: A=-1, B=3.

A_abs=1.

C=3² -1*3 -1²=9-3-1=5>0 → output ">".

delta is -1*q +3 =3 -q ≈3-1.618=1.382>0 → output ">", correct.

Another example: A=-1, B=1.

B is positive.

A_abs=1.

C=1² -1*1 -1² =1-1-1= -1 <0 → output "<".

delta =-q +1 =1 -q ≈-0.618<0 → output "<", correct.

Another example: A=-2, B=5.

A_abs=2.

C=5² -2*5 -2²=25-10-4=11>0 → output ">".

delta=5-2q. 2q is about 3.236. 5-3.236=1.764>0 → output ">".

Yes.

So the revised code logic is:

For A>0:

   if B >=0: output ">".

   else: compute C = B² +A*B -A².

   if C <0: output ">", else "<".

For A<0:

   if B <=0: output "<".

   else: compute C = B² - A_abs*B - A_abs².

   if C>0: output ">", else "<".

This seems to handle all cases correctly.

So, the mistake in the original code logic was not checking the sign of B when A is positive (or B's sign when A is negative) first.

So now, the code must be modified to handle these cases.

Let's test the initial example where A=1, B=3.

Since B is positive, output ">".

Which is correct.

Another example where A=1, B=3.

Yes.

Now, the code should handle all cases correctly.

So, the revised code steps are:

Compute A = a1 -a2, B =b1 -b2.

If A and B are both zero: output "=".

Else:

   if A ==0:

      if B>0: output ">".

      else: output "<".

   elif A >0:

      if B >=0:

          output ">"

      else:

          C = B**2 + A*B - A*A.

          if C <0:

              output ">"

          else:

              output "<"

   else: # A <0

      if B <=0:

          output "<"

      else:

          A_abs = -A

          C = B**2 - A_abs*B - A_abs**2

          if C>0:

              output ">"

          else:

              output "<"

Now, this should handle all cases correctly.

Let's re-test the example where A=1, B=-3.

B is negative.

C = (-3)^2 +1*(-3) -1^2 =9-3-1=5 >=0. So output "<".

Which is correct, since delta=1*q -3 ≈1.618-3= -1.382 <0.

Another example where A=1, B=-1:

C = (-1)^2 +1*(-1) -1 =1-1-1= -1 <0 → output ">", which is correct.

Now, the code should handle all cases.

So, this is the correct approach.

Now, the code needs to implement this logic.

Now, in terms of the code:

We need to process each string to compute a and b.

Then compute the differences.

Then apply the above logic.

Now, let's write the code.

The code will read two strings, s1 and s2.

Process each to get (a1, b1) and (a2, b2).

Compute A = a1 -a2, B= b1 -b2.

Then the steps as above.

The code for processing a string is straightforward.

But for very large strings (1e5 characters), the code must be efficient. But the code is O(n) for each string, which is acceptable.

Now, let's write the code.

Sample code:

Read the two strings.

def compute_a_b(s):

    a = 0

    b = 0

    for c in s:

        d = int(c)

        new_a = a + b

        new_b = a + d

        a, b = new_a, new_b

    return a, b

s1 = input().strip()

s2 = input().strip()

a1, b1 = compute_a_b(s1)

a2, b2 = compute_a_b(s2)

A = a1 - a2

B = b1 - b2

if A == 0 and B ==0:

    print("=")

else:

    if A ==0:

        if B >0:

            print(">")

        else:

            print("<")

    elif A >0:

        if B >=0:

            print(">")

        else:

            C = B*B + A*B - A*A

            if C <0:

                print(">")

            else:

                print("<")

    else:

        if B <=0:

            print("<")

        else:

            A_abs = -A

            C = B*B - A_abs*B - A_abs*A_abs

            if C >0:

                print(">")

            else:

                print("<")

Testing this code with the example where A=1, B=3:

The code outputs ">", correct.

The earlier problematic example where A=1, B=3, the code will output ">" because B is positive.

Another example where A=1, B=-1:

The code will compute B is negative, then compute C= (-1)^2 +1*(-1) -1=1-1-1=-1 <0 → output ">", which is correct.

Another example where A=2, B=-5:

B is negative. Compute C= (-5)^2 +2*(-5) -4=25-10-4=11 ≥0 → output "<".

Which is correct.

Another example where A=-1, B=3:

A is negative. B is positive.

Compute C=3² -1*3 -1=9-3-1=5>0 → output ">".

Correct.

Another example where A=-1, B=1:

C=1^2 -1*1 -1=1-1-1= -1 ≤0 → output "<".

Correct.

So the code is correct now.

Now, the code should pass all the test cases.

In the first example:

First string's a=2, b=1. Second string's a=2, b=2. So A=0, B=-1. So output '<'.

Second example: a1=1, b1=1. a2=1, b2=1. Output '='.

Third example: a1=2, b1=1. a2=1, b2=2. A=1, B=-1. B is negative.

C= (-1)^2 +1*(-1) -1^2 =1-1-1=-1 <0 → output '>'.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code is correct now.
