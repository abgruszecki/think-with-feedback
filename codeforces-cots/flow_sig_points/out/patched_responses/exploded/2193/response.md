Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the problem is about maximizing the number of distinct subsequences of a string after adding n characters. The initial string is t, which has m characters, and we can add n characters, each chosen from the first k lowercase letters. Our goal is to choose these added characters such that the total number of distinct subsequences is as large as possible.

Hmm. I remember that there's a standard way to calculate the number of distinct subsequences for a given string. Let me recall that. Oh right, the formula involves dynamic programming where for each new character, the number of new subsequences is the previous total plus one, but adjusted for overlaps when the same character is added before.

Wait, the formula for the number of distinct subsequences is something like this: dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 2 - last[char], where last[char] is the number of subsequences that ended with the previous occurrence of the same character. Or maybe it's a different approach. Oh right, the standard approach is to track the current count and subtract the contribution of the previous occurrence of the same character to avoid duplicates.

So the initial idea is that when you append a character c to a string, the number of new subsequences added is equal to the current total (because you can take all existing subsequences and append c to them), plus one (the subsequence consisting of just c). But if there was a previous occurrence of c, then those subsequences that ended with the previous c would be duplicates. So we subtract the count from before that previous occurrence.

So for the initial string t, we can compute the number of distinct subsequences using this method. Then, when adding new characters, we need to choose each new character in a way that maximizes the number of subsequences. But how?

The key is that when adding a new character, we want to maximize the contribution of that character. To maximize the increase in subsequences, each new character should be as "new" as possible. That is, it's best if the next character is one that hasn't been added in the recent steps, so that when you add it, the subtraction term (last[char]) is as small as possible. Because then, the new subsequences added would be as large as possible.

Wait, let's think. The formula for adding a character c is:

new_dp = (current_dp * 2 - last[c]) mod MOD.

If last[c] is as small as possible, then the subtraction is minimized, which makes new_dp as large as possible. So to maximize new_dp, we should choose a character c that has the smallest possible last[c] value.

So, when adding each of the n characters, the optimal choice is to pick a character that hasn't appeared in the current string for as long as possible. Because the last occurrence of that character would be as far back as possible, which would make the last[c] value as small as possible. Or wait, no. Wait, the last[c] is the previous contribution of c. Let me think again.

Suppose the current value of last[c] is some value. When you add a new c, the new number of subsequences is (current_dp * 2 - last[c]). Then, last[c] is updated to the previous current_dp. So, if the last time c was added was a long time ago, then the previous last[c] would be small. Because after that, the current_dp has increased a lot. So when you add c again, the subtraction is small, leading to a larger new_dp.

So to maximize the number, each time we add a character, we need to choose the character whose last occurrence's contribution is the smallest. Because that way, when you subtract last[c], you're subtracting the least possible, which gives the maximum possible new_dp.

So the optimal strategy is to cycle through the k characters in a way that each new character is chosen such that the last occurrence of that character is as far back as possible. For example, if we have k=3, then adding a, then b, then c, then a again, etc. Because each time you add a character that hasn't been added in the most recent steps, the last[c] will be the smallest possible.

But how to model this for the n characters that we can add after the initial t string.

Let's split the problem into two parts:

1. Compute the number of distinct subsequences for the initial string t.

2. Compute the optimal way to add n characters to maximize the number of distinct subsequences.

For the first part, we can compute it using the standard method. Let's initialize a variable dp which starts at 1 (the empty subsequence). Then, for each character in t, we compute dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD, where last[c] is the previous contribution (the value of dp before the previous occurrence of c). We also update last[c] to the previous dp before the current step.

Once that's done, we have the initial count. Then, for the next n steps (each adding a character), we need to choose which character to add to maximize the total.

So the question is, for each of the n steps, which character to add so that the new dp is as large as possible.

To model this, we need to track for each possible character, what is their current last value. Then, select the character with the smallest last value. Because adding that character would result in the maximum possible new_dp.

But how do we track this efficiently?

If we have k possible characters, and for each step, we can track the last occurrence's contribution for each character, then for each step, we can select the character with the minimum last value. Adding that character gives the maximum possible new_dp.

But with n up to 1e6 and k up to 26, this approach is feasible. For each of the n steps, we can iterate through all k characters to find the one with the minimum last value. Since 1e6 * 26 is 26 million, which is acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Compute the initial dp and last array based on the given t.

- Then, for each of the n steps:

   - Find the character c with the smallest last[c] value.

   - Compute new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD.

   - Update last[c] to the current dp (before the update).

   - Set dp = new_dp.

But wait, in the standard formula, when you add a character c, the new dp is (dp * 2 - last[c]). Then, the last[c] is updated to the previous dp (before this step). So for the next occurrence of c, the last[c] would be the dp before this step.

So in our case, when we choose to add character c, the steps would be:

new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) mod MOD

prev_last_c = last[c]

last[c] = dp

dp = new_dp

So the next time we add c, the last[c] will be the current dp before that step, which was new_dp from this step.

So, for each of the n added characters, we need to:

1. Choose the c in 1..k with the smallest last[c].

2. Update the dp and last[c] accordingly.

But how to track the last[c] for each possible c?

We can have a dictionary or an array (since k is up to 26) that tracks last[c] for each possible c. For characters that haven't been added yet, their last[c] is 0. Because in the initial formula, the first occurrence of a character contributes (dp * 2 - 0) = dp*2. So for characters that have not been added yet, their last value is 0. For example, when adding the first 'a' to the empty string, last['a'] starts at 0.

Wait, let's think about the initial setup. The initial string t may already contain some of the k characters. So the last array after processing t will have the last occurrence's contribution for each character in t.

For characters not present in t, their last value is 0. So when we start adding the n characters, for any character not in the initial t, their last[c] is 0, which is the smallest possible. So the first step would choose one of those characters (if any) to add. Then, the next step would again choose the character with the smallest last[c].

So for the added characters, the optimal strategy is to cycle through the k characters in the order that allows each new character to be as "new" as possible. For example, if all k characters are available (their last[c] is 0 initially), then adding them in any order would have the same effect. Wait, no. Because after adding the first character (say 'a'), the next addition could be 'b', which has last[b] = 0. Then 'c' etc. So each new character added would be chosen from the ones with the smallest last[c].

But in the case where the initial string t has some characters, and the added n steps are to choose the best possible characters.

So the key idea is that for each added step, the optimal character to add is the one with the smallest last[c] value. This will maximize the new_dp.

So the algorithm becomes:

Compute the initial dp and last array after processing t.

Then, for each of the next n steps:

   Find the character c in the k possible letters with the smallest last[c].

   Compute new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD.

   Update last[c] to the current dp (before the step).

   Set dp = new_dp.

But how to handle cases where multiple characters have the same minimal last[c]?

In that case, choosing any of them is acceptable. Because adding any of them would lead to the same increase. So we can pick any. For example, if two characters have last[c] = 0, adding either would result in the same new_dp.

But in practice, when adding a new character, the last[c] for that character is updated to the current dp. So for the next steps, if we add the same character again, the last[c] would be higher. Therefore, the strategy is to cycle through the characters, adding them in the order of their last[c] being as small as possible.

But in the case where k is 2, and we have to add multiple characters. For example, after the first two steps adding a and b, their last values are 1 and 1 (assuming initial dp after t is 1). Then, adding a again would have last[a] = 1, and the new_dp would be (current_dp * 2 - 1). But what if current_dp is 3, then new_dp would be 5. Then last[a] becomes 3. The next step, perhaps adding b again (last[b] is 1), leading to new_dp = 5*2 -1=9. So by choosing the character with the smallest last each time, we can maximize the new_dp each step.

So the plan is to, for each of the n steps, pick the character c with the smallest last[c], then update accordingly.

Now, how to implement this efficiently?

Since k is up to 26, for each step, we can loop through all k characters and find the minimum last[c]. That's O(nk) time. For n up to 1e6, and k up to 26, 26e6 operations are acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, track the current minimum and the characters that have that minimum. But with each step, the last[c] of the chosen character increases to the previous dp. So the next steps may have varying minima. Since after choosing a character, its last[c] becomes the previous dp, which is larger than before, the next minimum may be among the other characters.

But given that k is small, checking all 26 each time is manageable.

So the steps for the code:

1. Read n and k.

2. Read the string t.

3. Compute the initial dp and last array.

   Initialize dp = 1 (empty subsequence).

   last is a dictionary or array initialized to 0 for each of the k characters.

   For each character c in t:

       old_dp = dp

       dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD

       last[c] = old_dp

       (Ensure that dp is kept within mod and not negative.)

4. Then, process the n steps:

   For each step in 1..n:

       find the c with the smallest last[c]

       compute new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD

       old_last = last[c]

       last[c] = dp

       dp = new_dp

5. Return dp as the answer, modulo 1e9+7.

But wait, the MOD is 1e9+7. So all operations should be done modulo this.

But in the problem statement, we need to compute the number modulo 1e9+7, but the goal is to maximize the initial value, not the modulo. So the subtraction must be handled carefully to avoid negative values. For example, (dp * 2 - last[c]) could be negative. So we can add MOD and then take mod again.

So in code, when computing new_dp, we can do:

new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[c]) % MOD

But in Python, if the result is negative, the modulo operation will adjust it. For example, (5 - 7) % 1e9+7 would be 1e9+5. So that's handled correctly.

Now, handling the initial processing of t.

For each character in t, we need to process it as per the standard subsequence counting method.

So for example, in the first sample input:

n=1, k=3, t=ac.

Processing 'a' and 'c'.

Initial dp is 1.

Processing 'a' (the first character):

old_dp = 1

dp = 1 * 2 - last['a'] (0) → 2.

last['a'] = 1.

Then, processing 'c':

old_dp = 2.

dp = 2*2 - last['c'] (0) →4.

last['c'] = 2.

Then, adding one more character. The available k is 3. So possible characters are 'a', 'b', 'c'. Their last values are 1, 0, 2. Wait, the initial last array for the other characters (like 'b') would be 0. Because in the processing of t, which is 'ac', the last for 'a' is 1, 'c' is 2. 'b' hasn't been processed, so last['b'] remains 0.

So when adding the n=1 character, we look for the character with the minimal last value. The minimal is 0 (for 'b').

So new_dp = (4 * 2) - 0 → 8.

Then last['b'] is updated to 4.

So the answer is 8, which matches the sample.

So the code seems to handle that correctly.

Another sample:

n=0, k=2, t=aaba.

We need to compute the number of subsequences for 'aaba'.

Let's see:

Initialize dp=1, last = {'a':0, 'b':0}.

Process 'a':

old_dp=1 → dp becomes 1*2 - 0 = 2. last['a'] =1.

Process 'a' again:

old_dp=2 → dp=2*2 - 1 =3. last['a']=2.

Process 'b':

old_dp=3 → dp=3*2 -0=6. last['b']=3.

Process 'a' again:

old_dp=6 → dp=6*2 - 2 (last['a'] is 2) → 12-2=10. last['a']=6.

So the answer is 10, which matches the second sample.

So the code works for the samples.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But note that the initial string t can be up to 1e6 characters, and n can be up to 1e6. So the code needs to process 2e6 steps at worst.

In Python, this is acceptable as long as the code is optimized.

But in the code, for each step in the initial t processing, and each of the n steps, we need to process each character.

For the n steps, each step requires checking all k characters to find the one with the minimal last value. Since k can be up to 26, this is manageable.

So, the code steps:

Read n and k.

Read the string t.

Initialize last as a dictionary or list. Since the first k letters are lowercase letters a, b, ..., up to k letters. So for k=3, the possible characters are 'a', 'b', 'c'.

Wait, but the input string t can consist of characters from the first k letters. So in processing the initial t, we can process each character as per their code. But for the added steps, we need to choose the optimal character from the first k letters.

So for the last array, the keys are the first k letters (ord('a') to ord('a') +k-1). So for k=3, 'a', 'b', 'c' are the possible choices.

Thus, the code should generate a list for the first k characters. For example, for each character in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' up to k characters, we can track their last value.

But in code, how to represent the last array? For example, for a character c, which is one of the first k letters, we can map it to an index. For example, the code can be:

letters = [chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k)]

But perhaps it's more efficient to represent the last values as a list of size k, where each index corresponds to a character (0 is 'a', 1 is 'b', etc.)

So for code:

k is given.

last = [0] * k

Then, for a character in the input t, say 'c', if k >=3, then index is 2. But if k is 2, then the problem statement says that the input t consists of only the first k letters. So the input t is valid.

So processing the initial string t:

for c in t:

    idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

    old_dp = dp

    dp = (dp * 2 - last[idx]) % MOD

    last[idx] = old_dp

Then, for the n steps:

for _ in range(n):

    # find the index with the minimal last value.

    min_val = min(last)

    # find all indices with min_val.

    # pick the first one (since all are same)

    # but in Python, how to find the index with the min?

    # loop through all k elements.

    min_idx = 0

    for i in range(1, k):

        if last[i] < last[min_idx]:

            min_idx = i

    # compute new_dp

    new_dp = (dp * 2 - last[min_idx]) % MOD

    # update last and dp

    last[min_idx] = dp

    dp = new_dp

But this loop for finding the min in each of the n steps is O(k) per step, which for n=1e6 and k=26 is 26 million operations. That's acceptable in Python for the time constraints.

But perhaps the code can be optimized further.

Alternative approach: track the current minimum and the indices that have this minimum. But in the worst case, this may not help much, but for code simplicity, it's better to just loop through all k each time.

Now, considering that modulo is 1e9+7.

So code steps:

MOD = 10**9 +7

Read n, k.

t = input().strip()

Process the initial t:

dp = 1

last = [0] * k

for c in t:

    idx = ord(c) - ord('a')

    old_dp = dp

    dp = (dp * 2 - last[idx]) % MOD

    # handle possible negative values by adding MOD and then taking mod again.

    # but in Python, the % operator handles it.

    last[idx] = old_dp

Then process the n steps:

for _ in range(n):

    # find the index with the minimal last value.

    min_val = min(last)

    # find the first occurrence of min_val.

    # or loop until find the first.

    # but perhaps the code can loop through all elements.

    min_idx = 0

    for i in range(k):

        if last[i] == min_val:

            min_idx = i

            break

    # but this would break after the first occurrence. However, if there are multiple with min_val, the first is chosen.

    # but since all min_val are same, any index is acceptable.

    # so the code can be:

    min_idx = 0

    current_min = last[0]

    for i in range(1, k):

        if last[i] < current_min:

            current_min = last[i]

            min_idx = i

    # then proceed.

    new_dp = (dp * 2 - current_min) % MOD

    last[min_idx] = dp

    dp = new_dp

But wait, current_min is the value of last[min_idx], which is the minimal. So the code can use that.

Yes.

Thus, the code for the n steps is as above.

Now, what about handling the mod? Because in each step, the new_dp can be up to 2 * dp - 0, which can be very large. But Python's integers can handle it, but modulo is applied at each step to prevent overflow.

So, all operations are done modulo 1e9+7.

Now, test case 1:

n=1, k=3, t=ac.

Initial processing:

dp starts at 1.

Processing 'a' (index 0):

old_dp = 1.

dp becomes (1*2 - 0) = 2.

last[0] = 1.

Then 'c' (index 2):

old_dp = 2.

dp = 2*2 -0 =4.

last[2] = 2.

Then, add 1 character.

n=1.

In the loop for n steps:

Looking for the minimal in last, which are [1, 0, 2].

So the minimal is 0 (index 1).

new_dp = 4*2 -0 =8 mod MOD.

last[1] is set to 4.

dp is 8.

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: n=0, then the code just returns dp after processing t.

So code seems correct.

Now, let's code this in Python.

But note that in Python, when dealing with very large n (1e6), and in each iteration, a loop of k steps (26), the code may be tight for time constraints. But with 26 million operations, it's manageable in Python for 2 seconds.

But let's see.

In Python, for 1e6 iterations, each with 26 steps (to find the min index), that's 26e6 steps. Each step is a simple compare and possibly update variables.

In Python, each loop iteration is about 0.1 nanoseconds, but actually, in reality, it's more like 0.1 nanoseconds per step? Not sure. But 26 million steps in Python should take about a second or less. So within 2 seconds, it's manageable.

So the code should work.

Another possible optimization: precompute the list of characters for the k letters. But in the code, the loop over the k elements is straightforward.

So the code:

Read n and k.

Read t.

Initialize dp as 1.

last is a list of 0s for each of the k letters.

Process each character in t.

Then, for n steps:

   find the index with the minimal last value.

   compute new_dp.

   update last and dp.

Finally, output dp mod MOD.

But need to handle the MOD correctly.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    MOD = 10**9 +7

    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    t = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    dp = 1
    last = [0] * k

    for c in t:
        idx = ord(c) - ord('a')
        old_dp = dp
        dp = (dp * 2 - last[idx]) % MOD
        last[idx] = old_dp

    for _ in range(n):
        # Find the index with the minimal last value
        min_idx = 0
        min_val = last[0]
        for i in range(1, k):
            if last[i] < min_val:
                min_val = last[i]
                min_idx = i
        new_dp = (dp * 2 - min_val) % MOD
        last[min_idx] = dp
        dp = new_dp

    print(dp % MOD, file=output_stream)

Sample 2:

n=0, k=2.

t='aaba'.

Processing each character:

Initial dp=1.

First 'a' (idx0):

dp=1*2 -0=2, last[0]=1.

Second 'a' (idx0):

dp=2*2 -1=3, last[0]=2.

Third 'b' (idx1):

dp=3*2 -0=6, last[1]=3.

Fourth 'a' (idx0):

dp=6*2 -2=10, last[0]=6.

n=0, so no steps.

dp is 10, output 10 mod 1e9+7 is 10.

So code works.

Now, check the case where k=1. For example, n=5, k=1, t is 'a'.

Initial processing of 'a' gives:

dp after first step: 2 -0=2, last[0] =1.

But when adding n=5 characters, each time we can only choose 'a'.

Each step:

new_dp = dp*2 - last[0].

last[0] is updated to previous dp.

So initial after t is 'a':

dp=2, last[0] =1.

Adding first new 'a':

new_dp = 2*2 -1=3.

last[0] becomes 2.

dp=3.

Second new 'a':

new_dp =3*2 -2=4.

last[0] becomes3.

dp=4.

Third step:

new_dp=4*2 -3=5.

last[0]=4.

dp=5.

Fourth step: 5*2 -4=6.

last=5, dp=6.

Fifth step: 6*2 -5=7.

last=6, dp=7.

So the total is 7.

The number of subsequences for the string 'aaaaa' (original 'a' plus 5 'a's).

But the formula for a string of all same characters: the number of subsequences is len(s) + 1. But this is only true when all characters are the same. Wait, no. For example, for 'a', the number is 2 (empty and 'a'). For 'aa', the number is 3: empty, 'a1', 'a2', but 'a1a2' is same as 'a2a1' when considered as subsequences. Wait, no. All subsequences are the empty string, each single 'a' (but they are considered the same since the characters are the same). So for a string of m 'a's, the number of distinct subsequences is m+1 (empty plus the count of each possible number of 'a's, each of which is unique). So for 'a', 2 (empty and 'a'). For 'aa', 3 (empty, 'a', 'aa'). For 'aaa', 4, etc.

But according to the formula, for each new 'a', the dp becomes (prev_dp *2 - last['a']). Let's see:

Initial t is 'a' → dp=2 (empty and 'a').

Adding 'a' (first step):

new_dp = 2*2 - 1 (last['a'] is 1) →4-1=3. But according to the formula, the correct count should be 3 (empty, 'a1', 'a2', 'a1a2' → but wait, these are 3 distinct subsequences? No. Wait, when you have 'a' (the initial one) followed by another 'a', the possible distinct subsequences are:

empty, 'a', 'a', 'aa' → but 'a' appears twice. So the distinct count is 3 (empty, 'a', 'aa').

But according to the formula, after processing the initial 'a', the count is 2. Adding another 'a' gives (2*2 -1) =3, which matches.

Yes. So the code's formula works correctly.

Thus, the code handles all cases correctly.

Therefore, the code is correct.
