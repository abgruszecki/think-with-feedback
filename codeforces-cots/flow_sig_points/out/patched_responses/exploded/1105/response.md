Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a traffic light configuration could lead to an accident. The accident happens if a pedestrian light (p) and any of the car lights (l, s, r) in the same part or connected parts are green at the same time. 

First, let me understand the problem better. The setup is four road parts, each part has four lights: l, s, r for cars entering, and p for pedestrians. If for any part, the pedestrian light is green (p=1) and any car light (either in that part or a connected part) is green, then there's an accident.

Wait, the note says that cars from part 1 can hit pedestrians in parts 1 and 4. So maybe the parts are connected in some way. Like, the parts are arranged in a cycle? Like part 1 is connected to part 2, part 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 1? Or maybe each part's car lanes lead into other parts. For example, if part 1 has a right turn (r), that might lead into part 4's lanes. So when part 1's r is green, cars from part 1's right turn are entering part 4. So if part 1's r is green, then part 4's pedestrian light is green, that's a problem.

So the key is: For each part, if its pedestrian light is green, then any of the car lights in that part, or in any part that can lead into it via their car lanes, must not be green. Because those cars could be going into the same part where the pedestrian is.

Wait, perhaps the accident can happen if a car is allowed to enter or exit a part while the pedestrian is crossing that same part. So the connections between parts are such that if a car in part A is allowed to go into part B, then if part A's car light (l, s, r) is green, then any pedestrian in part B could be in danger.

Alternatively, each part's car directions (l, s, r) correspond to directions that could lead into other parts. For example, maybe:

- The left lane of part 1 leads to part 4.
- The straight lane leads to part 2.
- The right lane leads to part 3.

But I'm not exactly sure. The problem statement says that each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection and 3 getting out. But how they are connected to the other parts?

Alternatively, the problem note in the first example says that part 1's cars can hit pedestrians in parts 1 and 4. So perhaps the cars in part 1's lanes (l, s, r) are in parts that are connected to part 1 and part 4. So when a part's car light is green, any pedestrian light in the same part or in parts connected via those lanes would be a problem.

So the approach is: for each part i, check if p_i is green. Then, check if any of the car lights in part i (l_i, s_i, r_i) are green. If any of them are, then accident is possible. Also, check if the car lights in parts that are connected to part i (maybe through their own lanes) are green and their pedestrian light is green.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when a part's car light (like l, s, r) is green, it's allowing cars to either enter or exit the part, and if that's the case, any part connected via that movement (like the part that the cars are entering) must have their pedestrian light not green.

But how do the parts connect? I need to model which parts are connected via each lane (l, s, r) of a given part.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way to model this is that each part's lanes (l, s, r) can lead to other parts. For example, if part 1's left lane is green, then cars leaving part 1 via left may go into another part, say part 4. So if part 4's pedestrian light is green, that's a collision.

Alternatively, maybe the four parts are arranged in a cycle. So part 1's left leads into part 4, straight into part 2, right into part 3. Or perhaps the connections are such that each part's lanes (l, s, r) correspond to certain other parts.

Wait, the problem statement says that each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (each direction) and 3 getting out. So perhaps each part is connected to three other parts via their lanes. But how?

This is a bit unclear, but the note in the first example gives a hint. In the first example:

Part 1 has l=1, s=0, r=0, p=1. So the left lane is green. The pedestrian light for part 1 is also green. So that's a problem. Also, the cars in part 1's left lane can hit pedestrians in part 4, which has p=1. So part 1's left lane must be connected to part 4. So perhaps the left lane of part i is connected to part (i-1) mod 4? Let's see.

In the first example, part 1's left lane is connected to part 4, and part 4's pedestrian light is green. So part 1's left (green) allows cars to enter part 4. So if part4's p is green, then accident.

So perhaps the connections are as follows for each part i (1-based? Or 0-based? Probably 0-based in code, but in the example, parts are numbered 1-4):

Each part has three lanes: left, straight, right. For each of these lanes, when they are green, cars can exit the part via that lane and enter another part. For example, part i's left lane leads to part (i-1) mod 4. Straight leads to part (i+1) mod 4. Right leads to part (i+2) mod 4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the left, straight, right lanes of a part correspond to the same part's exit, but into different directions. Like left lane of part 1 connects to part 4, straight to part 2, right to part 3. Then, when part 1's left is green, cars can exit part 1 and enter part 4, leading to part 4's lanes. So if part 4's pedestrian light is green, then collision.

So for any part i:

- If any of l_i, s_i, r_i is green (1), then for the current part i's p_i, if p_i is 1, then accident. Also, for each lane (l, s, r) of part i, which leads to another part j, then check if part j's p is 1.

Wait, perhaps the accident occurs if either:

1. The pedestrian light of part i is green, and any of part i's car lanes (l, s, r) are green. Because then cars in part i's lanes are moving (either entering or exiting?), conflicting with the pedestrian in part i.

OR

2. The pedestrian light of part j is green, and part i has a lane that leads to part j, and part i's lane is green. So cars from part i's lane (which is green) are entering part j, which has a pedestrian crossing green. So collision.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

For each part i from 0 to 3 (assuming 0-based index):

- Check if p_i is 1. If not, skip.

- For each car lane (l, s, r) in part i: if any is 1, then accident is possible.

- Then, check all parts j where part j is reachable via any of part i's car lanes. Wait, no. Wait, if part i has a car lane that is green, then that allows cars to go into part j. So if part j's pedestrian light is green, then collision.

Alternatively, maybe for each part i's car lanes (l, s, r), each of these lanes when green causes cars to enter another part. So if any of those other parts have p=1, then accident.

Alternatively, the problem is that a car can be in a lane (from any part) that allows it to enter the part where the pedestrian is crossing.

Wait, the problem statement says that an accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the pedestrian's part's light is green, and any lane (from any part) that leads into or out of that part has a green light.

So for a pedestrian in part i, any car lane in part i (l_i, s_i, r_i) being green would mean cars are entering or exiting part i, leading to collision. Also, any car lane in other parts j that can lead into part i (like part j's lanes that go into i) if those lanes are green would also cause collision.

So for each part i where p_i is 1, check:

- Any of l_i, s_i, r_i is 1. If yes, accident.

- Any of the lanes (from other parts j) that can reach part i. For example, if part j's left lane leads to part i, then check if part j's left is 1.

But how to model which lanes from other parts lead into part i?

This is the crux of the problem. To model which parts are connected via which lanes.

The first example's note says that part 1's left lane (green) can hit pedestrians in parts 1 and 4. So part 1's left lane is connected to part 4. So maybe, the left lane of part i leads to part (i-1) mod 4, straight leads to part (i+1) mod 4, and right leads to part (i+2) mod 4? Let's see:

In part 1 (assuming 1-based), left leads to 0 (if 0-based) or 4 (if mod 4, 1-1=0 mod 4, which would be part 0 if 0-based). But in the first example's note, part 1's left connects to part 4. If parts are 1-based, then 1's left is part 4. So mod 4, (1-1) mod4 is 0, but perhaps the parts are 0-based. Hmm, perhaps the parts are arranged in a cycle of 0-3. Let's think:

Suppose parts are numbered 0,1,2,3. Then, for part i:

left lane leads to (i-1) mod4.

straight leads to (i+1) mod4.

right lane leads to (i+2) mod4.

So part 0's left is part 3 (0-1= -1 mod4=3), straight is 1, right is 2.

In the first example, part 1 (0-based part 0?) would have left leading to part 3 (0-1=3). But the note says part 1's left leads to part 4. Wait, maybe the parts are 1-based, but that complicates the modulo. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is different.

Alternatively, maybe each part's lanes (l, s, r) correspond to different connections. For example:

The problem statement says that the four parts are given in a counter-clockwise order. So perhaps the parts are arranged in a square, connected in a cycle. So part 0 is next to part 1, part 1 next to part 2, part 2 next to part 3, part 3 next to part 0.

But how do the lanes (l, s, r) connect to other parts?

Maybe:

Each part's left lane (l) allows cars to turn left, which would take them into the part that is counter-clockwise adjacent. For example, in part 0, left would go to part 3.

Straight (s) would go to the part directly across (but that's part 2, which is not adjacent). Wait, maybe straight leads to the next part in the counter-clockwise order. Wait, perhaps the direction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the three lanes (l, s, r) for a part correspond to the three other parts. For example, part i's left lane is connected to part (i+1) mod4, straight to part (i+2) mod4, right to part (i+3) mod4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the left lane of a part connects to the next part in counter-clockwise order, the straight to the one across, and the right to the next in clockwise. For example, part 0's left leads to part 3 (next counter-clockwise), straight to part 2 (opposite), right to part 1 (next clockwise).

This is a crucial part of the problem. We need to model which other parts are connected via each lane of a given part.

Looking at the first example's note:

In the first example, part 1's left (l=1) is connected to part 4. Wait, but there are only four parts. So perhaps the example's parts are numbered 1-4, but in code, they are 0-3.

Wait, the input has four lines, each line describes a road part given in counter-clockwise order. So maybe the first line is part 0, the next part 1, then 2, then 3, arranged in counter-clockwise order. Then, for part i:

left lane (l) could lead to part (i-1) mod4 (counter-clockwise neighbor), straight (s) to part (i) (wait, that's the same part?), but that can't be. Or perhaps straight leads to the part that is opposite. For example, part 0's straight leads to part 2, part 1's straight leads to part 3.

Right lane (r) leads to the clockwise neighbor. So part 0's right lane leads to part 1.

But let's see the first example:

Input lines (assuming parts 0,1,2,3):

Line 1: 1 0 0 1 → part 0's l=1, s=0, r=0, p=1.

The note says part 1's (so part 0 in code) left can hit pedestrians in parts 1 and 4 (which would be parts 0 and 3 in code? Wait, perhaps the example's part numbers are 1-based, but code uses 0-based. So the first line is part 1 in the example. Let's see:

First example input:

1 0 0 1 → part 1 (in example's terms) has l=1. According to the note, this can hit pedestrians in parts 1 and 4. So part 1's left leads to part 4 (but there are only four parts). Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the left lane of part i (0-based) leads to part (i-1) mod4, straight to part (i+1) mod4, and right to part (i+2) mod4. Let's test this for the first example's note.

In example 1, part 1 (code part 0) has l=1. According to the model, left leads to part (0-1) mod4 = 3. So part 3's p is 1. So when part 0's left is green, and part3's p is green, there's a collision. The note says that in part 1's case (code part0), pedestrians in part4 (code part3) are hit. So yes. So this model seems to fit.

So, for each part i:

- left lane leads to (i-1) mod4.

- straight leads to (i+1) mod4.

- right lane leads to (i+2) mod4.

So part i's left is the previous part in the cycle, straight is next part, right is the part two steps ahead (mod4). So for part 0:

left → 3, straight → 1, right →2.

Part 1's left →0, straight→2, right→3.

Part 2's left→1, straight→3, right→0.

Part3's left→2, straight→0, right→1.

So in the first example's note, part1 (code part0) has left=1 (green). The left lane leads to part3 (code part3). Part3's p is 1. So that's a problem. Also, part1's own p is 1, so any of its lanes (l=1) is green. So accident occurs.

So the approach is: for each part i, check if its pedestrian p is green. Then, check if any of the car lanes in part i (l, s, r) are green. If so, accident. Then, also check all the parts j that are connected to i via their lanes. For example, for part j, if any of j's lanes (l, s, r) when green leads to i, then if j's lane is green and i's p is green, accident.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The accident is when a pedestrian's part (i) has p_i=1, and any car lane that leads into or out of i is green. Because then the car and pedestrian are in the same part at the same time.

Wait, the problem statement says: An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

So, for a part i where p_i=1, any lane (from any part) that can get to or from part i (i.e., that can enter or exit part i) must not be green.

So the steps are:

For each part i:

If p_i is 0, skip.

Else, check:

1. Any of part i's l, s, r is 1. If yes, accident possible.

2. Any lane in other parts j (j !=i) that leads to i. For example, part j's lane (l, s, r) is connected to i. If that lane is green, then accident.

So, for each part i where p_i=1:

Check all lanes in all parts j (including j=i) that are either in part i (so their own lanes) or in parts j where their lane leads to i.

So, the approach is:

For each part i (0-3):

If p_i is not 1, skip.

For each part j (0-3):

Check each of j's lanes (l, s, r). For each lane in j:

If the lane leads to i (based on j's lane direction), then if j's lane is 1, then accident.

Because if j's lane is green, cars are allowed to go into part i (if the lane's direction is to i), and part i's pedestrian is allowed. So collision.

So for part j's lane, for example, the left lane of j leads to (j-1) mod4. So if (j-1) mod4 ==i, then that's a lane that leads to i.

Similarly, j's straight lane leads to (j+1) mod4. If that's i, then lane is connected to i.

j's right lane leads to (j+2) mod4. If that's i, then connected.

So for each part j, and each of their lanes (l, s, r), we check if that lane leads to i.

If any of those lanes is green, and part i's p is 1, then accident.

So the plan is:

For each of the four parts i (0-3):

If p_i is 1:

Check for each part j (0-3):

Check each of j's l, s, r lanes.

For each of these lanes:

If the lane's direction leads to i, and the lane is 1, then return "YES".

Because this means there's a car allowed to move into part i (if j's lane leads to i), and the pedestrian is allowed in i.

Additionally, even part i's own lanes (l, s, r) are considered. For example, j=i's l, s, r. For example, j=i's left lane leads to i-1 mod4. Unless i-1 mod4 is i (which is only possible if i is 0, 0-1= -1 mod4=3, which is different from i=0), but perhaps j's lane could lead to i. For example, part j= i, and lane is straight: j's straight is (j+1) mod4. So if j=i and (j+1) mod4 ==i → only possible if j+1 ≡i mod4 → which implies j+1 = i → which can't happen unless mod4=0. So no. So for part j=i, their lanes' directions could only point to other parts. So when j=i, their lanes are for exiting, not entering. Wait, but the problem statement says that each part has 3 lanes getting into and 3 getting out. So perhaps each lane is either an incoming or outgoing. Wait, perhaps the lanes (l, s, r) are the outgoing lanes of the part j. So when a car is in part j, and the lane is green, they can leave via that lane to another part. So for example, j's left lane (when green) allows cars to exit j and enter (j-1 mod4). So if part i is (j-1 mod4), then j's left lane green would mean cars are allowed to enter i. So if i's p is green, then collision.

So in code, for each part i where p_i is 1:

Check if any part j (including j=i) has any lane (l, s, r) that, when green, leads to i. Because that would mean cars are entering i from j's lane. So if j's lane is green, then collision.

So the steps in code:

For each of the four parts:

Check if p is 1.

If so:

Loop through all parts j (0-3):

For each j's l, s, r:

Check what part that lane leads to. If it leads to i, and the lane is 1, then accident.

So in code:

parts = [list of the four parts, each a list [l, s, r, p]]

for i in 0..3:

    if parts[i][3] == 1:

        for j in 0..3:

            # check j's l, s, r

            l, s, r, _ = parts[j]

            # check left lane of j: leads to (j-1) mod4

            if (j-1) %4 == i and l ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check straight lane of j: leads to (j+1) mod4

            if (j+1) %4 ==i and s ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check right lane of j: leads to (j+2) mod4

            if (j+2) %4 ==i and r ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

        # Also check if any of i's own l, s, r are 1?

Wait, the problem statement says that the accident can occur if the pedestrian's part's light is green and any lane (from same part) that can get to or from that same part. So the lanes in part i (j=i) that are in the same part: for example, if part i's left lane is green, that allows cars to exit i into (i-1 mod4). But does that affect part i's pedestrian? Or the problem is that part i's own lanes (l, s, r) being green allows cars to be in part i.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that part i's own lanes (l, s, r) being green allows cars to be present in part i (either entering or exiting), leading to collision if the pedestrian is in part i.

For example, if part i's l is green, that allows cars to exit via left into (i-1 mod4). So the cars are exiting part i, but during that time, the pedestrian is in part i. Are they in the same physical space? If so, then the accident can happen.

But according to the first example's note, part 1's cars can hit pedestrians in part 1 and 4. So if part i's own car lanes (l, s, r) are green, that's a problem for part i's p being green.

So in addition to checking all parts j's lanes that lead to i, we also need to check part i's own lanes. Because when j is i, their lanes are exiting, but perhaps that allows cars to be in part i's lanes (exiting), which could conflict with the pedestrian in part i.

So the code needs to check for all lanes (j, lane) where the lane leads to i (as before) OR if j is i and the lane is in j's own part. Wait, no. Wait, part j's lane is a lane for exiting j. So when j's lane is green, cars are leaving j. So for example, if j is part i (i.e., j = i), and their lane is green, that allows cars to leave part i. So the cars are in part i's outgoing lanes. But the pedestrian is in part i's crossing. So if a car is exiting part i via a lane (e.g., left), they would be in the outgoing lane of i (which is part of part i?), which may cross the pedestrian's path. Hence, even part i's own lanes (l, s, r) being green would cause a collision when p is green.

So, in code, for a part i where p_i is 1:

Check:

- Any of part i's l, s, r is 1. If yes, accident.

- For all parts j, check if any of their lanes (l, s, r) leads to i. If any of those lanes is 1, accident.

So combining both conditions.

So the code would:

For each part i:

if p_i is 1:

   if any of l_i, s_i, r_i is 1 → accident.

   for all j in 0-3:

       check if j's l leads to i → if j's l is 1 → accident.

       check if j's s leads to i → if j's s is 1 → accident.

       check if j's r leads to i → if j's r is 1 → accident.

Wait, but how do we check if j's lane leads to i? That's determined by the direction of the lane.

For example:

j's left leads to (j-1) mod4.

j's straight leads to (j+1) mod4.

j's right leads to (j+2) mod4.

So for each j and lane in j, compute the target part. If the target is i and the lane is 1, then accident.

So in code:

parts = [ ... ]

for i in range(4):

    if parts[i][3] == 1:

        # Check part i's own lanes

        if any(parts[i][0], parts[i][1], parts[i][2]):

            print("YES")

            exit()

        # Check other parts' lanes that lead to i

        for j in range(4):

            l, s, r, p_j = parts[j]

            # check left lane

            target = (j - 1) %4

            if target == i and l ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check straight

            target = (j +1) %4

            if target == i and s ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check right

            target = (j +2) %4

            if target == i and r ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

So this code checks for part i's p being 1, and then checks:

- Any of i's own car lanes (l, s, r) is 1. Because if a car is exiting i via those lanes, and the pedestrian is in i, collision.

- Any other part j's car lane that leads into i (i is the target of j's lane). So if j's lane is green, cars are allowed to enter i, and pedestrian is in i → collision.

This seems to cover all possibilities.

Testing this logic against the first example.

First example's input:

Part 0 (first line):

l=1, s=0, r=0, p=1.

So parts[0] has p=1.

Check if any of l, s, r (1,0,0) → yes. So immediately, code returns "YES".

Which matches the first example's output.

In the second example:

Input:

0 1 1 0 → part0 p=0.

1 0 1 0 → part1 p=0.

1 1 0 0 → part2 p=0.

0 0 0 1 → part3 p=1.

So check part3's p=1.

Check part3's l, s, r: 0,0,0 → no.

Then check all j:

For j=0:

l=0, s=1, r=1.

left leads to (0-1)=3 → i=3. So j=0's left is 0. No.

straight leads to 1 → not 3. No.

right leads to 2 → not 3. No.

j=1:

l=1 (parts[1] l is 1?), s=0, r=1.

Wait, parts[1] is the second line: 1 0 1 0 → l=1, s=0, r=1, p=0.

left leads to (1-1)=0 → not 3. No.

straight leads to (1+1)=2 → no.

right leads to (1+2)=3 → yes. So parts[1]'s right is 1. So target is 3. So this is j=1, right=1. So code will detect this and return YES?

Wait but in the second example, the output is NO. Wait, that can't be.

Wait the second example's input:

Line 1: 0 1 1 0 → part0: l=0, s=1, r=1, p=0.

Line 2: 1 0 1 0 → part1: l=1, s=0, r=1, p=0.

Line3:1 1 0 0 → part2: l=1, s=1, r=0, p=0.

Line4:0 0 0 1 → part3: l=0, s=0, r=0, p=1.

So when i=3 (p=1):

Check part3's own lanes: l=0, s=0, r=0 → no.

Then check all j's lanes that lead to 3.

j=0:

left leads to (0-1)=3 → target is 3. So check j=0's left lane (0). → 0, not 1.

straight leads to 1 → not 3.

right leads to 2 → no.

j=0's left is 0, so no.

j=1:

left leads to 0 → no.

straight leads to 2 → no.

right leads to 1+2=3 → yes. j=1's r is 1. So check if parts[1].r is 1 → yes. So code would return YES. But the second example's output is NO. So there's a conflict here.

But according to the example's note, in the second example, part4 (code part3) is the only green pedestrian light. So any car lane that leads into part3 must be checked.

In the second example, part1's right lane (code j=1, right=1) leads to part3 (i=3). So the code would detect this and return YES. But the example's output is NO. What's wrong here?

Ah, this indicates a mistake in our model. So according to the example, part3's p is 1, but part1's right lane is 1. But according to the code, this would be a collision. But the example's output is NO.

So there's a mistake in the model. Which means our understanding of how lanes connect is incorrect.

So we need to re-examine the problem statement and the example.

Let me recheck the second example:

The input is:

0 1 1 0 → part0: l=0, s=1, r=1, p=0.

1 0 1 0 → part1: l=1, s=0, r=1, p=0.

1 1 0 0 → part2: l=1, s=1, r=0, p=0.

0 0 0 1 → part3: l=0, s=0, r=0, p=1.

The output is NO.

So part3's p is 1. The code as per our model would check j=1's right lane (r=1) which leads to j+2=1+2=3 → i=3. So code returns YES. But the example's output is NO. So our model is wrong.

This indicates that the model for how lanes connect is incorrect.

So where's the error?

Let's look at the second example's note. It says: no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So part3's p is 1. But the cars from other parts' lanes that lead to part3 must be red.

In the second example's input, part1's right lane is 1. According to our model, this leads to part3. So the code would detect this and return YES, but the example's output is NO. So our model must be wrong.

So the problem is in how we model the lanes' directions.

Alternative approach: let's think of the four parts as arranged in a cycle. Each part has three outgoing lanes (l, s, r) which connect to other parts. But perhaps the lanes are not as previously modeled.

Alternative idea: For each part, the left lane leads to the previous part in the cycle (counter-clockwise), the straight lane leads to the next part in the cycle (clockwise), and the right lane leads to the part across.

Wait, but how?

For example, parts are arranged 0,1,2,3 in a cycle (0 next to 1, 1 next to 2, etc.). Then:

- left lane (l) of part 0 would turn counter-clockwise, leading to part3.

- straight (s) would go straight ahead, which in a cross intersection would be part2 (opposite).

- right (r) would turn clockwise, leading to part1.

But this is a different model. Let's see:

For part0:

left → part3 (counter-clockwise)

straight → part2 (opposite)

right → part1 (clockwise)

For part1:

left → part0 (counter-clockwise)

straight → part3 (opposite)

right → part2 (clockwise)

But this may not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the straight lane leads to the next part in the cycle.

But this is getting complicated. Let's look for another way.

Alternative approach: Let's see what the second example's input implies.

In the second example, part3's p is 1. The code according to our previous model would check j=1's right lane, which is 1, and which leads to 3 (j=1, right leads to 1+2=3). So code would return YES, but the example's output is NO. So our model is incorrect.

So perhaps the right lane leads to a different part. Let's see:

In the second example, part1's right lane is 1 (r=1). According to the example's note, this should not lead to part3. So perhaps the right lane of part1 leads to a different part.

What if:

The left lane leads to the next part in the cycle (clockwise), the straight leads to the opposite part, and the right leads to the previous part (counter-clockwise). Or some other combination.

Alternative idea: Maybe the left lane leads to the part that is two steps ahead, right leads to the previous part, and straight leads to the next part. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the lanes are:

For each part, the left lane leads to the same part (so cars turn left and stay in the same part?), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are modeled such that:

Each part's left lane leads to the part that is two steps ahead (i+2 mod4), straight leads to the next part (i+1 mod4), and right leads to the previous part (i-1 mod4). Let's test this.

For part j:

left → j+2 mod4.

straight → j+1 mod4.

right → j-1 mod4.

In the second example, j=1 (part1's code is j=1) has right lane (r=1). According to this model, right leads to j-1=0. So j=1's right lane leads to part0. So when part3's p is 1, the code would check if any lanes lead to part3. For j=1's right lane leads to part0, not part3. So no collision.

In that case, the code would not detect the j=1's right lane. Let's re-express the code.

So for part j's right lane, the target is (j-1) mod4.

In the second example's input:

j=1's right lane is 1. Target is 0. So this doesn't affect part3 (i=3). So code would not trigger. Thus, output is NO, which matches the example.

But then how does the first example's note work?

First example's part1 (code part0) has left lane (l=1). According to this model, left lane leads to j=0+2=2 mod4. So part0's left lane leads to part2. But the note says part1's left lane can hit pedestrians in parts1 and4 (code parts0 and3). So this model doesn't fit.

So this approach is incorrect.

Alternative plan: perhaps the lanes are modeled as follows:

Each part's left lane (l) leads to the part that is two steps ahead (i+2 mod4). The straight (s) lane leads to the next part (i+1 mod4). The right (r) lane leads to the previous part (i-1 mod4).

In the second example, j=1's right lane leads to 0. So code wouldn't detect collision for i=3. So code returns NO, which is correct.

In the first example, part0's left lane (l=1) leads to 0+2=2 mod4. So part2. The note says that part1's left lane leads to part4 (code part3). So this model doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Alternative idea: Maybe the lanes' directions are not modeled by mathematical formulas but by fixed connections. For example:

The four parts are arranged in a cycle. Each part's left lane leads to the previous part in the cycle, straight leads to the part across, and right leads to the next part.

For example:

Part0's left is part3 (previous), straight is part2 (across), right is part1 (next).

Part1's left is part0 (previous), straight is part3 (across), right is part2 (next).

Part2's left is part1 (previous), straight is part0 (across), right is part3 (next).

Part3's left is part2 (previous), straight is part1 (across), right is part0 (next).

In this model, for part j:

left → (j-1) mod4.

straight → (j+2) mod4.

right → (j+1) mod4.

So for j=0:

left →3, straight →2, right →1.

j=1:

left →0, straight →3, right →2.

j=2:

left →1, straight →0, right →3.

j=3:

left →2, straight →1, right →0.

In the second example:

j=1's right lane is 1 (code part1's right is 1). This leads to part2 (j+1=2). So code would check if part2's p is 1. No. So no collision.

In the first example, part0's left lane leads to part3. So code would check part3's p. In the first example, part3's p is 0 (fourth line's p is 1, which is part3's p? Wait, first example's input is:

Line1: 1 0 0 1 → part0: p=1.

Line2:0 1 0 0 → part1: p=0.

Line3:0 0 1 0 → part2: p=0.

Line4:0 0 0 1 → part3: p=1.

So part0's p is 1, and part3's p is 1.

For part0's left lane (l=1), the target is part3. So code would check j=0's left lane (1) and target is part3. part3's p is 1. So code would return YES.

But according to the model where j's left lane leads to j-1 mod4, this is the case. So code would return YES for the first example.

But for the second example, j=1's right lane leads to j+1=2. So part2's p is 0. So no collision. So code would not return YES, which matches the example.

So this model works for both examples.

But how to confirm this?

Let me re-examine the first example's note. The note says part1's cars can hit pedestrians in part1 and part4 (code part0 and part3).

In this model:

part0's p is 1. part0's own lanes (l=1) are green. So code would detect part0's l=1 and part0's p=1 → accident.

Additionally, part0's left lane leads to part3. part3's p is 1. So part0's l=1 would trigger part3's p=1.

So code would check:

i=0:

p=1. Check part0's own lanes (l=1) → accident.

So code returns YES.

i=3's p=1. Check part3's own lanes (l=0, s=0, r=0 → no). Then check other parts:

j=0's left leads to 3 → part0's l=1. So for i=3, j=0's l is 1 and leads to 3 → code would detect.

So in the first example, there are multiple ways to trigger the accident.

So the model where:

for each part j:

left lane leads to (j-1) mod4.

straight leads to (j+2) mod4.

right leads to (j+1) mod4.

seems to work.

So the correct approach is:

For each part i where p_i is 1:

Check if any of part i's lanes (l, s, r) is 1 → accident.

Check if any other part j's lane (l, s, r) is 1 and leads to i → accident.

So the code needs to model the directions correctly.

So in code:

for i in 0 to 3:

    if parts[i][3] == 1:

        # Check part i's own lanes

        if parts[i][0] or parts[i][1] or parts[i][2]:

            print("YES")

            exit()

        # Check other parts' lanes that lead to i

        for j in 0 to 3:

            l, s, r, _ = parts[j]

            # check left lane of j: target (j-1) mod4

            if (j-1) %4 == i and l ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check straight lane of j: target (j+2) mod4

            if (j+2) %4 == i and s ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

            # check right lane of j: target (j+1) mod4

            if (j+1) %4 == i and r ==1:

                print("YES")

                exit()

This code would correctly model the directions.

Testing this with the second example:

i=3:

parts[3] p=1.

Check parts[3]'s own lanes: 0,0,0 → no.

Check other parts:

j=0:

left leads to -1 mod4=3 → i=3. j=0's left is 0 → no.

straight leads to 0+2=2 mod4 → not 3 → no.

right leads to 0+1=1 → no.

j=1:

left leads to 0 → no.

straight leads to 1+2=3 → yes. j=1's s is 0 → no.

right leads to 2 → no.

j=2:

left leads to 1 → no.

straight leads to 4 mod4=0 → no.

right leads to 3 → yes. j=2's right is 0 → no.

j=3:

left leads to 2 → no.

straight leads to 5 mod4=1 → no.

right leads to 4 mod4=0 → no.

So no lanes lead to i=3. Thus, output is NO, which is correct.

In the first example:

i=0's p=1:

parts[0]'s l=1 → accident. code returns YES.

So this model works.

Another example: third input.

Input:

1 0 0 0 → part0: p=0.

0 0 0 1 → part1: p=1.

0 0 0 0 → part2: p=0.

1 0 1 0 → part3: p=0.

Check part1's p=1.

Check part1's own lanes: 0,0,0 → no.

Check other parts:

j=0:

left leads to 3 → not 1.

straight leads to 0+2=2 → no.

right leads to 1 → yes. j=0's right is 0 → no.

j=1:

left leads to 0 → no.

straight leads to 3 → no.

right leads to 2 → no.

j=2:

left leads to 1 → yes. j=2's left is 0 → no.

straight leads to 4 mod4=0 → no.

right leads to 3 → no.

j=3:

left leads to 2 → no.

straight leads to 5 mod4=1 → yes. j=3's s=0 → no.

right leads to 4 mod4=0 → no.

So no lanes. Output is NO.

Which matches the third example's output.

Thus, the code should implement this model.

So the code will:

- Read four parts.

- For each part, check if p is 1.

- If so, check if any of its own l, s, r is 1 → accident.

- Check all parts j's lanes:

   for j's left lane: if (j-1) mod4 ==i and l is 1 → accident.

   for j's straight lane: if (j+2) mod4 ==i and s is 1 → accident.

   for j's right lane: if (j+1) mod4 ==i and r is 1 → accident.

Thus, the code should look like this.

```python
parts = []

    l, s, r, p = map(int, input().split())
    parts.append((l, s, r, p))

        # Check if any of the current part's car lights are green
        if parts[i][0] or parts[i][1] or parts[i][2]:
            print("YES")
            exit()

                print("YES")
                exit()

print("NO")
