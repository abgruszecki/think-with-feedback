Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem is about making a bracket sequence correct by performing reorder operations on consecutive subsegments. Each reorder takes time equal to the length of the subsegment. We need to find the minimum total time required, or return -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's possible. The key here is that the sequence can be reordered any number of times. Each reorder operation allows us to take a consecutive substring, rearrange the brackets in any order, and pay the length of the substring as the cost.

But wait, what's the condition for a correct bracket sequence? It must be balanced, meaning the number of opening and closing brackets must be equal. So first, we need to check if the total number of '(' equals the number of ')'. If not, return -1 immediately.

Assuming the counts are equal, the next step is to figure out the minimal cost. Let's think about the structure of the correct sequence. For a correct bracket sequence, during any prefix of the string, the number of '(' is at least the number of ')'. So any imbalance in the original sequence must be fixed by rearranging some segments.

The reorder operation allows us to rearrange a substring. For example, if there's a substring that has a bunch of closing brackets followed by opening ones, we can reorder them to balance the prefixes.

Hmm. The challenge is to find the minimal sum of lengths of such subsegments that, when reordered, fix the sequence to be correct.

Let's think about the process of the correct sequence. The standard way to check correctness is to track the balance: start with 0, add 1 for '(', subtract 1 for ')'. The balance must never drop below zero, and end at zero.

So, the problem reduces to ensuring that the balance never becomes negative. For the given string, we can track the balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative, that's a problem. So how can we fix these points using the reorder operations?

Each reorder operation allows us to take a consecutive segment and reorder it. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to find the regions where the balance becomes negative and fix those regions with minimal cost.

Wait, but reordering a segment can rearrange the brackets in that segment. For example, if in a segment there are a certain number of '(' and ')', after reordering, we can arrange them in any order. So, for a segment that's part of a problem area, maybe we can reorganize the brackets to minimize the balance drops.

But how do we model this?

Let's first compute the balance array. For each position, track the balance. If at any point the balance is negative, those are the positions where the sequence is invalid. But how can reordering help here?

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal segments that cover all the problem areas. For example, when the balance goes negative, we might need to reorder a segment that includes the positions where the balance is negative.

Alternatively, think of the minimal number of intervals that, when reordered, can fix the balance.

Let me think of an example. In the first sample input:

Input is 8 characters: ))((())(
The original sequence is "))((())(".

The balance array would be:

After first character ')': -1 → invalid. Then after second ')': -2. Then two '(', bringing balance to 0. Then another '(', balance 1. Then ')', balance 0. Then ')', balance -1. Then '(' brings it to 0.

So the problem areas are at positions 0,1, and 5 (where balance becomes negative). Wait, but how does the sample solution fix this? The first reorder is from the first four characters (positions 0-3) which are ))(( → reordered to ()() → balance then becomes +1, +2, +1, +2. Then the next reorder is positions 6-7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The sample output says the seventh to eighth character, which in 1-based is 7-8, which in 0-based is 6-7. So after reordering those two, which are ')(' → becomes '()'.

But how does this affect the overall balance? Let's see:

After first reorder, the sequence is ()() followed by the remaining part. Let's track the balance after the first four characters are ()():

After each character:
( → 1
) → 0
( →1
) →0
Then comes the remaining part: ())(
Wait, original input after first four characters is ())(:

So after the first four are replaced with ()() (balance 0), then the next is ( → balance 1, then ), balance 0, ), balance -1, then ( → 0. So the problem occurs at the fifth step (the second ')'). So the first reorder fixes the initial problem, but the next problem is after the sixth character (the third ')')?

Hmm, perhaps the balance after the first reorder is:

The first four characters are ()():

balance after each step:
1,0,1,0.

Then the next character is the fifth (assuming 0-based index 4?), which was originally part of the ())( part. Wait, perhaps the input after the first four is ()) ( assuming the original input was ))(( ( the first four chars), then after the first four, the fifth is '(', sixth is ')', seventh is ')', eighth is '('.

Wait, original input is index 0: ), 1: ), 2: (, 3: (, 4: (, 5: ), 6: ), 7: (.

After reordering the first four characters (indices 0-3) into ()() (so the sequence becomes:

0: (, 1: ), 2: (, 3: ), then indices 4-7 remain as before: (, ), ), (.

So the entire sequence is ()() ( ) ) (.

Wait, let's track the balance after the first four steps:

At index 0: '(', balance 1.

Index 1: ')', balance 0.

Index 2: '(', balance 1.

Index 3: ')', balance 0.

Then index 4: '(', balance 1.

Index 5: ')', balance 0.

Index 6: ')', balance -1 → problem here.

Then index 7: '(', balance 0.

So the balance becomes -1 at index 6. So the second reorder is done on positions 7-8 (assuming 1-based, which are 6-7 in 0-based). The substring is ')(' which is reordered to '()'. So the sequence becomes ()() () () → balance is correct.

So the key is that each reorder operation can fix some of the balance issues.

But how do we model the minimal cost?

Another approach: The correct sequence must have the same number of '(' and ')'. So first check that. Then, in a correct sequence, the balance never drops below zero.

The problem is that the original sequence may have points where the balance is negative. We need to find the minimal cost to cover those negative points with reorder operations.

Each reorder operation can be any consecutive substring. When we reorder a substring, the brackets inside it can be rearranged optimally, so that after the reorder, the balance in that region is fixed.

Wait, but how? For example, when we reorder a substring, we can arrange the '(' and ')' in any order. So, the optimal arrangement is to arrange the substring such that, when processed, the balance never drops below the minimum possible.

But perhaps the minimal cost is to find all the regions where the balance becomes negative, and cover them with the minimal possible intervals, adding the lengths of those intervals.

But how?

Alternatively, consider that each time we have a "valley" in the balance (i.e., a point where the balance is negative), we need to cover it with some interval. The cost is the sum of the lengths of those intervals.

But how to find these intervals optimally.

Let's think of the balance array. Let's compute the balance after each step. For example, in the sample input, the balance array before any operations is:

Positions 0: -1, 1: -2, 2: -1, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: -1, 7: 0.

But the problem is that during processing the original sequence, the balance can't go negative. So the points where the balance is negative are the ones that need to be fixed.

But how do the reorder operations fix these points?

When we reorder a substring, the brackets in that substring can be rearranged. For instance, if a substring has a certain number of '(' and ')', after reordering, their arrangement can affect the balance. For example, a substring with more '('s could be arranged to all be at the beginning, thus maximizing the balance.

But perhaps the optimal way to arrange the substring is to have all '('s first, then all ')'. That way, the balance in the substring increases as much as possible first, then decreases. This would minimize the chances of the balance dropping below zero.

So, when we reorder a substring, the best arrangement is to arrange all '('s first, then ')'s. This would contribute the maximum possible balance to the overall sequence.

But how does this help with the overall balance?

Let's model this. Suppose that the original string has some points where the balance becomes negative. We need to cover those points with reordered intervals. For each such interval, when we reorder it, the balance in that interval is fixed. The cost is the length of the interval.

The question is: what is the minimal sum of lengths of intervals that cover all the positions where the original balance is negative, and when these intervals are reordered (i.e., arranged as all '('s followed by all ')')s), the entire sequence has a non-negative balance at every step.

So the problem reduces to selecting intervals such that after rearrangement, the balance never drops below zero, and the sum of their lengths is minimized.

This sounds similar to interval covering, but with the added complexity that the arrangement of the intervals affects the balance.

Wait, but perhaps the key insight is that the minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of the intervals where the original balance is negative, but these intervals must be arranged in a way that their rearrangement fixes the balance.

Alternatively, let's model the process step by step.

Let's compute the balance array for the original string. Each position where the balance is negative must be covered by at least one reorder interval. But how does the reordering of a substring affect the balance?

When a substring is reordered to have all '('s first, then ')', the balance within that substring increases as much as possible. So, during the reordered substring, the balance can be higher than in the original sequence. This could help prevent the overall balance from dipping below zero.

So perhaps the minimal intervals are the ones that cover the regions where the original balance is negative, and the reordering of those intervals ensures that the balance in those regions is as high as possible.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach: Let's think of the entire string as being partitioned into segments that are either unmodified (original order) or reordered (all '('s first, then ')'). The problem is to select which segments to reorder such that the entire sequence is correct, and the sum of the lengths of the reordered segments is minimized.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, think in terms of the balance. Let's track the current balance, and whenever we encounter a point where the balance would drop below zero (either in the original or in the reordered segments), we need to reorder some interval to fix that.

Let me consider the balance of the original sequence. Let's say that during processing the original sequence, the balance reaches a minimum at some points. The problem is that these points are below zero.

So, for example, the original balance array has some minimum values. The reordered segments can adjust the balance in those regions.

But how?

Alternatively, the reordered segments can be considered as regions where the brackets are optimally arranged (all '('s first). So the balance in those regions starts at the balance just before the reordered segment, then increases by the number of '('s in the segment, then decreases by the number of ')'s. But since the entire segment is reordered, the order is all '('s followed by ')'.

This is a crucial observation. So, for a reordered segment [i, j], which contains a '('s and b ')'s (a + b = j - i + 1), the balance during processing this segment would start at balance_before, then increase by a (all '('s), then decrease by b (all ')'). So the balance after processing the segment would be balance_before + a - b. But the minimum balance during the segment would be balance_before (if there are any ')')?

Wait, no. Let's think: after the reordered segment, the brackets are arranged as a '('s followed by b ')'. So during the processing of the segment:

- The balance starts at B_prev (balance_before).

- For each of the a '('s, balance increases by 1 each: balance becomes B_prev + 1, B_prev + 2, ..., B_prev + a.

- Then, for each of the b ')', balance decreases by 1 each: B_prev +a -1, B_prev +a -2, ..., B_prev +a -b.

The minimum balance during this segment is min(B_prev, B_prev + a - b). Because the first part is increasing, the minimum is B_prev (the initial value). The second part is decreasing, so the minimum during the ')'s part is B_prev + a - b (if a >= b, then B_prev +a -b is B_prev + (a-b), which could be higher than B_prev, but if a < b, then B_prev +a -b could be lower than B_prev.

Wait, but the a and b are the number of '(' and ')' in the reordered segment. Since the entire sequence must have equal numbers of '(' and ')', the entire reordered segment must have a = b if the entire sequence is correct. Wait no: the entire sequence must have equal numbers of '(' and ')', but individual reordered segments can have any a and b as long as the entire sequence's counts are balanced. Wait, no. Because each reorder operation doesn't change the counts. So the original sequence must have a total of equal numbers of '(' and ')', otherwise it's impossible. So during the reordering, each segment's a and b are fixed (since the reorder operation doesn't change the counts of brackets in the segment). So for any reordered segment, the number of '(' and ')' in that segment are fixed. So, when you reorder the segment, you can arrange them in any order, but you can't change their counts.

So for a segment with a '(' and b ')', when you reorder them as all '(' followed by all ')', the balance in that segment will start at B_prev, increase to B_prev + a, then decrease to B_prev + a - b.

The minimum balance in this segment would be min(B_prev, B_prev + a - b). Because during the first part (all '('), balance increases, so the minimum is B_prev. Then, during the ')' part, balance decreases. The minimum during the entire segment would be the minimum between B_prev and (B_prev +a -b).

But in order to have a correct sequence, the balance must never drop below zero. So, during the processing of the reordered segment, the balance must stay >=0.

So for the reordered segment, we need to ensure that:

B_prev >=0 (since the previous steps are part of the unmodified or reordered segments that have been processed before, which must already ensure that up to this point, the balance is >=0).

Moreover, during the processing of this segment:

The balance after the '(', is B_prev + a. Then, during the ')', it decreases by 1 each step, so the minimal during the ')' part is B_prev +a -b.

But since the entire sequence must be correct, the minimal balance during the entire segment must be >=0. So:

B_prev >=0 (since the segment starts here)

and B_prev + a - b >=0.

But since the entire sequence is correct, the total a - b for all segments must be zero. Because the total number of '(' and ')' must be equal.

But for individual segments, a - b can be any value. So for each reordered segment, the a and b are the number of '(' and ')' in that segment. But since the entire sequence has equal counts, the sum of a - b over all reordered segments plus the sum over unmodified segments must be zero. However, this is automatically handled since each reordered segment's a and b are the same as in the original.

Wait, no. Because the reordered segments are part of the original sequence. So the original sequence has some total of '(' and ')'. When we reorder a segment, we don't change the counts. So the entire sequence's counts are the same as the original. Therefore, for the entire sequence to be correct, the original counts must be equal. Otherwise, it's impossible. So first, we check if the number of '(' and ')' are equal. If not, return -1.

Assuming they are equal, then the sum of a - b for all segments (both reordered and unmodified) will be zero.

But during processing, the balance must not drop below zero. So for each segment, whether reordered or not, the processing must ensure that the balance remains >=0.

But when a segment is reordered, we can arrange the brackets in the optimal way (all '(' first). For unmodified segments, their brackets are processed in the original order, which may have balance drops.

But the problem is to choose which segments to reorder so that the entire balance never drops below zero, and the total cost (sum of lengths of reordered segments) is minimized.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem. The state would be the current position and the current balance, and we need to track the minimal cost up to that point. However, with n up to 1e6, a dynamic programming approach with O(n) time is possible only if the transitions are manageable.

Alternatively, we can model the problem as finding the minimal intervals to cover certain critical points where the balance would drop below zero, and arrange the reordered intervals to cover these points, such that after reordering, the balance in those intervals is handled optimally.

Another approach is to find the intervals where the original balance is negative, and cover them with the minimal number of intervals. But how?

Wait, the original balance array is computed. Let's process the original sequence and track the balance. Whenever the balance drops below zero, we need to cover those positions with reordered intervals. But the reordered intervals can alter the balance in such a way that these positions are fixed.

But how to model the effect of reordering a segment.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of the minimal intervals that cover all the positions where the original balance is negative, plus the minimal intervals required to cover any new negative balance that may arise from the reordered segments.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me think of the sample input:

Original balance array (simplified steps):

-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0.

The negative balances are at positions 0, 1, 2, 6.

The first reordered interval is 0-3 (length 4). This interval has 2 '(' and 2 ')'. So when reordered, they are arranged as '()()'. The balance during this interval starts at 0 (if the previous balance was 0, but wait, in the original sequence, the balance before the segment is negative. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, the reordered segments are processed as follows. Let's say that before processing a reordered segment, the balance is B. The segment has a '(' and b ')'. So during processing the segment:

After the a '('s, the balance becomes B + a.

Then, during the b ')', the balance decreases by 1 each step, ending at B + a - b.

The minimal balance during this segment is the minimum between B (before processing the segment) and B + a - b (the minimal after processing all brackets in the segment).

So, to ensure that during processing this segment, the balance never drops below zero, we need B >= 0 (since the first part of the segment is all '(', which increases the balance) and B + a - b >=0 (the minimal after processing the ')'s).

But how does this fit into the overall sequence?

Let's think about the entire sequence as a series of intervals, some of which are reordered. For each reordered interval, we have to ensure that when it is processed, the starting balance is >=0, and that the ending balance (after the reordered segment) is such that the following parts of the sequence can be processed correctly.

This seems quite involved.

Another approach: The reorder operation allows us to change the order of a consecutive substring. To make the entire sequence correct, the reordered sequence must have a balance that never drops below zero. So the problem is equivalent to finding a set of intervals that, when reordered (to all '(' followed by all ')'), results in a correct balance.

The minimal sum of the lengths of such intervals.

But how to find these intervals.

Perhaps the key is to find the intervals where the original balance is negative, and then determine the minimal intervals that can cover these negative balance points, such that when these intervals are reordered, the balance in the entire sequence remains non-negative.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, here's an insight: Each time the original balance is negative, that's a problem. However, reordering a segment that includes this position can fix the balance by rearranging the brackets in that segment. The optimal way to arrange the segment is to have as many '(' as possible at the beginning, thus increasing the balance.

So, perhaps the minimal intervals needed are the intervals that cover all the positions where the original balance is negative. However, this is not sufficient, as rearranging these intervals may create new negative balances elsewhere.

But perhaps not. For example, rearranging a segment to have all '(' first may increase the balance enough to prevent future negative balances.

But how can we model this.

An alternative idea comes from the standard way to find the minimal number of swaps or operations needed to correct a bracket sequence. However, this problem is different because the allowed operation is reordering a segment (with cost equal to the length) and we can do this any number of times.

Wait, another observation: the minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of the intervals that cover the 'valleys' where the balance is negative. Because each valley is a point where the balance is negative, and covering them with intervals allows us to reorder those segments to have the maximum possible balance, thus preventing the negative balance.

But what defines these valleys.

Let's compute the balance array of the original sequence. Then, the points where the balance is negative are the problem points. We need to cover all these points with intervals. Each interval [l, r] contributes a cost of (r - l + 1) to the total.

The goal is to select a set of intervals such that all problem points are covered, and the sum of the lengths is minimized.

But how to choose these intervals optimally.

For example, in the sample input, the problem points are positions 0,1,2,6. The first interval [0,3] covers 0,1,2,3 (but 3 is not a problem). The second interval [6,7] covers 6 and 7 (but 7 is not a problem). But the total cost is 4 + 2 = 6.

But how to model that.

Alternatively, the problem points are contiguous regions. For example, positions where the original balance is negative form contiguous blocks. So the minimal intervals are those that cover these blocks.

But that's not necessarily true. For example, the problem points could be in non-contiguous regions.

But let's compute the original balance array. Let's see.

Suppose the balance array is [-1, -2, -1, 0, ...]. Then the problem points are 0,1,2. So the first three positions have negative balance. So covering them with a single interval (from 0 to 2) would cost 3. But perhaps covering a larger interval (like 0-3) would cost more, but allow other parts of the sequence to be handled better.

Alternatively, the optimal way is to merge overlapping or adjacent intervals where the problem points are.

But this is vague.

Let's think of the balance array. For the original sequence, we track the balance. Let's find all the positions where the balance is negative. The minimal intervals to cover all these positions would be the minimal set of intervals that cover all such positions, and each interval can be reordered to fix the balance.

But after reordering, the balance in those intervals is handled optimally. So, for each interval, when reordered, the balance during that interval starts at the balance before the interval, then increases by the number of '(' in the interval (which is the count in the original segment), then decreases by the number of ')'. The minimal balance during the interval is the minimum of the starting balance and the ending balance.

So, for the reordered segment to be valid, the starting balance must be >=0, and the ending balance (after processing the segment) must be >=0.

But how to ensure this.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the minimal intervals that cover all the positions where the original balance is negative. Each interval must be as large as possible to cover as many problem points as possible, thereby reducing the total cost.

But how to compute this.

Another approach: Let's consider the original sequence. We compute the balance array. Let's find the regions where the balance is negative. Each such region must be covered by a reordered interval. The minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of these regions. However, this is not correct because overlapping intervals can be merged into a single interval with a smaller sum.

For example, two adjacent intervals can be merged into one, paying the length of the merged interval instead of the sum of the two.

So, the problem reduces to merging intervals that are adjacent or overlapping, and covering all the problem points.

This is similar to the interval merging problem. So, first, collect all the positions where the balance is negative, then find the minimal number of non-overlapping intervals that cover all these positions. The sum of their lengths is the cost.

But in the sample input, the problem points are 0,1,2,6. So the intervals would be [0,2] and [6,6]. The sum is 3 +1=4. But the sample's correct answer is 6, which is higher. So this approach is not correct.

Ah, because the intervals chosen must not only cover the problem points but also, when reordered, the balance in those intervals must not introduce new problem points elsewhere.

So, this approach is incorrect. The problem is that reordering one interval can affect the balance of the following parts.

So, the key is that when we reorder a segment, the balance after that segment is the same as it would be in the original sequence, because the number of '(' and ')' in the segment is the same (since we are reordering, not changing counts). So, the balance after processing a reordered segment is the same as it would have been in the original sequence. However, during the processing of the segment, the balance can be different.

But the overall balance after processing the entire string must be zero, which is ensured by the initial check.

So, the balance after any reordered segment is the same as in the original sequence. But during processing, the balance within the segment could be higher, thus avoiding negative balances.

Thus, the idea is that reordering a segment [l, r] changes the balance during processing of that segment, but the balance after r is the same as in the original sequence.

So, the problem is to select a set of intervals such that when those intervals are reordered, the balance during processing of the entire sequence never dips below zero.

But how to model this.

Let me try to model this step by step.

Suppose we process the string in order. For each position, we track the current balance. If we reorder a segment starting at l, then during processing that segment, the balance is adjusted as per the reordered segment.

But the crucial point is that after processing a reordered segment [l, r], the balance is the same as in the original sequence. So the balance after r is the same as it was before any reordering.

So, the effect of reordering a segment is to modify the balance during processing of that segment, but not the balance after that segment.

Thus, the problem can be modeled as follows:

The entire sequence is processed, and we can choose to reorder some segments. For each segment we reorder, the balance during that segment is computed as if all '('s are first, then ')'s. The balance after the segment remains the same as in the original sequence.

Our goal is to choose a set of segments such that the balance during processing never drops below zero, and the sum of the lengths is minimized.

Thus, the problem is to find the minimal sum of reordered segments such that the balance (as processed with reordered segments) remains non-negative at all positions.

To model this, perhaps we can track the current balance, and whenever a reordered segment is chosen, we process it as a block of '(' followed by ')'.

But how to find the optimal set of segments.

This seems like a greedy problem. Let's think greedily: whenever the balance would drop below zero in the original processing, we need to reorder a segment starting at or before this point.

But how to determine the optimal segment.

Alternatively, here's an approach inspired by the standard solution for the correct bracket sequence:

The minimal number of reordered segments is determined by the valleys in the balance array. The deeper the valley (i.e., the more negative the balance), the more segments needed.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of the intervals between the points where the balance reaches a new minimum.

For example, in the original balance array, each time a new minimum (more negative than previous minima) is encountered, we need to start a new interval. Then, the interval covers from the current position back to the point where the balance was last at this level.

Alternatively, the problem is similar to the problem where you need to find the number of intervals where the cumulative balance is negative, and each such interval contributes to the required reorder operations.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea comes from the fact that when you reorder a segment, you can arrange the brackets to be all '(' followed by all ')'. This ensures that during the processing of this segment, the balance starts at B_prev, increases by a (number of '(' in the segment), then decreases by b (number of ')'), ending up at B_prev + (a - b). Since the segment's a and b are the same as in the original, the ending balance is the same as in the original sequence. But during processing the segment, the balance is higher than in the original sequence.

So, the key is that reordering a segment can prevent the balance from dropping below zero during that segment. But after the segment, the balance is the same as in the original sequence.

Therefore, the problem is to select a set of segments such that for each segment, the balance during processing (after reordering) remains non-negative, and the sum of their lengths is minimized.

Let's model this with an example.

Original balance array:

Positions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Balance:   -1 -2 -1 0 1 0 -1 0.

So the original sequence has balance that goes to -2 at position 1.

If we reorder the segment from 0 to 3 (which has 2 '(' and 2 ')') as '()()', then during processing:

At position 0 (reordered to '('): balance is 1.

Position 1 (')': balance 0.

Position 2 ('(': balance 1.

Position 3 (')': balance 0.

Then the balance after position 3 is 0, same as original.

Then, original balance after position 3 is 0. Processing continues:

Position 4 (original is '(', balance 1.

Position 5: ')', balance 0.

Position 6: ')', balance -1 → problem.

So, after reordering the first segment, the balance at position 6 is -1. To fix this, we need to reorder another segment.

So, the problem is that even after reordering one segment, other segments may still have negative balance in the original processing.

But since the balance after reordered segments is the same as in the original, any negative balance in the original after a reordered segment will still be present unless another reordered segment is chosen.

Thus, the approach must select reordered segments such that all the points where the original balance is negative are covered, and that the reordered segments' processing ensures that during their processing, the balance does not drop below zero.

But how to model this.

Another way to look at it is: reordered segments can be used to "boost" the balance during processing, preventing it from going negative. The optimal strategy would be to reorder segments that cover the regions where the original balance is negative, and the reordered segments are arranged in such a way that the balance during processing never drops below zero.

So, let's try to process the string and track the current balance. Whenever we encounter a position where the original processing would cause the balance to drop below zero, we need to reorder a segment starting at some point before this position.

But how far back should this segment start?

The longer the segment, the higher the cost, but perhaps the more the balance is boosted, preventing future drops.

But this seems difficult to model.

Another approach inspired by the "greedy" algorithm for valid parentheses:

We can track the current balance. Whenever the balance drops below zero, we need to reorder a segment that starts at the current position and extends to the end of the current valley. Wait, but how.

Alternatively, here's an algorithm:

1. Check if the total number of '(' and ')' are equal. If not, return -1.

2. Compute the original balance array.

3. Find all the positions where the balance is negative.

4. If there are none, the sequence is already correct, return 0.

5. Otherwise, find the minimal intervals to cover all negative balances, ensuring that after reordering those intervals, the balance during processing remains non-negative.

But step 5 is not straightforward.

Alternatively, the minimal cost is the sum of the lengths of the intervals where the original balance is negative, merged into the minimal number of overlapping or adjacent intervals.

But in the sample input, the negative positions are 0,1,2,6. Merging 0-2 gives a length of 3. Then 6-6 is length 1. Sum is 4, but the sample answer is 6. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, this suggests that simply covering the negative positions is not sufficient. The reordered segments must also be such that their processing in the reordered way doesn't introduce new negative balances elsewhere.

Wait, but when we reorder a segment, the balance after processing it is the same as in the original sequence. So if the original balance after the segment is negative, but we have reordered the segment to handle the balance during processing, but after the segment, the balance is as per original. So if the original balance after the segment is negative, we need to reorder another segment that covers that part.

But this seems like an infinite loop.

Alternatively, the problem is that the reordered segments can only fix the balance during their processing. The balance after the segment is determined by the original sequence.

Thus, the only way to have the entire sequence correct is to reorder all segments where the original balance is negative, but also ensure that after reordering those segments, the balance during processing of the entire sequence is non-negative.

But how.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think of another way.

Suppose we process the string, and whenever the balance would drop below zero in the original processing, we need to reorder a segment that starts at some point before and ends after this position. When reordered, the segment has all '(' first, then ')', which may prevent the balance from dropping below zero.

But how to choose the start of the segment.

The optimal choice would be to reorder a segment starting at the earliest possible point where the balance is zero. Because that way, the reordered segment will have as many '(' as possible, thus maximizing the balance during processing.

Alternatively, for each position where the balance would drop below zero in the original sequence, find the earliest position where the balance was zero before this point. Then, reorder the segment from that earliest position to the current position. This ensures that the reordered segment starts with a balance of zero, allowing the maximum possible increase.

For example, in the sample input:

At position 1, the original balance is -2. The earliest position before 1 where the balance was zero is none (since the initial balance was zero, but the first character is ')', which brings it to -1). So perhaps this approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, for each position i where the original balance is negative, we look for the earliest position j <=i where the balance is at its current level. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Another idea inspired by the standard algorithm for the maximum valid parentheses substring:

The minimal number of reordered segments needed is determined by the number of times the balance dips below zero. Each dip corresponds to a segment that must be reordered.

For example, in the sample input, the balance array is [-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]. The balance drops below zero twice: once from 0 to -2 (positions 0-1), then again to -1 (position 6). So two segments are needed. But the sample answer uses two segments (cost 4+2=6).

But this is not directly applicable.

Alternatively, each time the balance reaches a new minimum (more negative than previous minima), a new segment must be started.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the key is to find the minimal number of intervals to cover all the negative balance positions, ensuring that each interval's reordering brings the balance during processing to non-negative levels.

For each interval [l, r], when reordered, the balance during processing is:

B_prev (balance before l) is >=0.

During the reordered segment:

- Balance increases by a (number of '(' in [l, r]) to B_prev +a.

- Then decreases by b (number of ')') to B_prev +a -b.

This must be >=0.

But since the entire sequence's counts are balanced, B_prev +a -b = B_prev + (a - b). But the original segment has a -b = (number of '(' - number of ')') in [l, r]. But this is equal to (balance after r) - (balance before l). Because balance after r is B_prev + (a -b) + (balance after r in original - balance before l in original).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Another observation: For any segment [l, r], the a and b are fixed (they are the number of '(' and ')') in that segment. So, a = (number of '(' in segment), b = (number of ')') in segment. Thus, a -b = (balance after r) - (balance before l). Because the balance after processing the segment in the original sequence is balance_before_l + (a_orig - b_orig), where a_orig and b_orig are the counts of '(' and ')'.

But in the reordered segment, a and b are the same as in the original segment. So, after reordering, the balance after the segment is balance_before_l + (a - b), which is the same as balance after r in the original sequence.

Thus, when we reorder a segment [l, r], the balance after processing the segment is the same as in the original sequence.

But during processing the segment, the balance starts at B_prev (balance before l), increases by a, then decreases by b. So the balance during the segment will be at least B_prev (during the '(' part) and may drop to B_prev +a -b (during the ')') part.

To ensure that the balance during processing the segment is >=0, we need:

B_prev >=0 (since during the '(' part, the balance increases, so the minimum during the '(' part is B_prev).

And B_prev +a -b >=0 (since during the ')' part, the balance decreases, so the minimum is B_prev +a -b).

But B_prev is the balance before the segment in the original sequence. So, if the original sequence's balance before l is negative, then even if we reorder the segment, the starting balance is negative, and the balance during the segment will be negative, which is invalid.

Thus, we must ensure that when we reorder a segment [l, r], the balance before l (in the original sequence) is >=0. Otherwise, even after reordering, the balance during processing the segment will start at a negative value, which is invalid.

But this is a problem, because in the original sequence, the balance before l could be negative.

Ah, this is a key point. For example, if the original balance before l is negative, then reordering the segment [l, r] will start processing the segment with a negative balance, leading to a balance during the segment that's negative, which is invalid.

Thus, to reorder a segment [l, r], the original balance before l must be >=0. Otherwise, it's impossible to reorder this segment without causing the balance to drop below zero during processing.

Therefore, the segments that can be reordered must start at a point where the original balance before l is >=0.

This is a crucial insight. So, the strategy is:

- Find all the positions where the original balance is negative.

- For each such position i, find the earliest possible l such that balance_before_l >=0 and the segment [l, r] covers i.

But how to do this.

Let's model this with the sample input.

Original balance array:

Positions: 0: balance is -1, 1: -2, 2: -1, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: -1, 7:0.

The balance before segment [0, 3] is balance_before_0 =0 (original balance before 0 is 0). So, even though during the original processing, the balance before 0 is 0, but the balance during the segment [0,3] in original processing is negative, reordering this segment will start with balance 0.

The reordered segment [0,3] has a=2, b=2. So during processing:

Balance starts at 0.

After a=2, balance becomes 2.

Then after b=2, balance is 0.

The minimal balance during processing is 0.

Thus, the entire segment is processed with non-negative balance.

But after this segment, the balance is 0 (same as original).

Then, the next positions are processed normally until position 6, where the balance in original is -1. So, to cover this, we need to reorder another segment.

The balance before position 6 is 0 (original balance after position 5 is 0). So, we can reorder the segment [6,7], which has a=1, b=1.

During processing, balance starts at 0. After a=1, balance is 1. Then after b=1, balance is 0. Thus, the balance during processing is >=0.

Thus, the total cost is 4 + 2 =6, which matches the sample.

So, the reordered segments must start at positions where the original balance before the segment is >=0, and they must cover all positions where the original balance is negative.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Check if the number of '(' and ')' are equal. If not, return -1.

2. Compute the original balance array. If balance is never negative, return 0.

3. Find all the positions where the balance is negative.

4. Iterate through these positions, grouping them into segments [l, r] where:

   a. l is the earliest position where the original balance before l is >=0.

   b. r is the earliest position after l where the original balance after r is >=0.

   c. The segment [l, r] covers all negative positions between l and r.

But how to find l and r for each group.

Another approach is to iterate through the original balance array, and whenever the balance is negative and not covered by a previous segment, find the earliest possible l such that balance_before_l >=0, and then find the minimal r where the balance after r is >=0, and the segment [l, r] covers all negative positions between l and r.

But how to efficiently compute this.

Alternatively, the problem can be solved by finding the minimal intervals that start and end at positions where the original balance is zero. Because the reordered segment must start at a position where the balance before is zero (or the earliest possible position where the balance is non-negative).

Wait, perhaps the solution is to find all the valleys in the balance array. Each valley is a segment where the balance dips below zero. For each such valley, find the earliest position to the left where the balance is zero, and the earliest position to the right where the balance returns to zero. The segment to reorder is from the left zero to the right zero.

For example, in the sample input, the first valley starts at position 0 and ends at position 2. The balance before position 0 is zero, and the balance at position 3 is zero. So the segment is [0, 3], which covers all negative positions between 0 and 3. The cost is 4.

The second valley is at position 6. The balance before position 6 is zero (at position 5), and the balance after position 7 is zero. So the segment is [6,7], cost 2.

Total cost 6.

This matches the sample.

Another example:

Input 3:

'((' → output -1. Because counts are 2 '(', 1 ')', so not equal. Thus, it's impossible.

Another example: if the input is '(()', counts are 3 '(' and 1 ')', so output -1.

So, the algorithm would be:

- For each valley (consecutive positions where balance is negative), find the nearest positions to the left and right where balance is zero. The segment between these positions (inclusive) covers the valley. The cost is the length of this segment.

- Sum all such segments.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if the total number of '(' and ')' are equal. If not, return -1.

2. Compute the balance array.

3. Check if balance ever goes negative. If not, return 0.

4. Find all valleys (consecutive negative balance positions).

5. For each valley, find the leftmost position before the valley where balance is zero (the start of the valley's segment), and the rightmost position after the valley where balance returns to zero (the end of the segment). The segment is from the leftmost to the rightmost position.

6. Sum the lengths of all such segments.

But how to find these segments.

Another idea: Each time the balance drops below zero, we need to find the earliest start position to the left where the balance was zero, and the earliest end position to the right where the balance returns to zero. This defines a segment to reorder.

For example, let's walk through the sample:

Original balance array: [-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]

The valleys are positions 0-2 (balance -1, -2, -1), and position 6 (balance -1).

For the first valley:

- Find the last position before 0 where balance was zero. That's position -1 (before the start), which is 0.

- Find the first position after the valley where balance returns to zero. That's position 3.

So the segment is 0-3 (length 4).

For the second valley (position 6):

- Find the last position before 6 where balance was zero. That's position 5.

- Find the first position after 6 where balance returns to zero. That's position 7.

So the segment is 6-7 (length 2).

Total cost 4+2=6.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For each valley (continuous negative balance), find the start and end positions where the balance is zero, and include the entire segment between those positions, including the start and end.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute the balance array.

2. Find all the intervals where the balance is negative. These are the valleys.

3. For each valley, find the start of the valley's segment as the last position before the valley where the balance is zero. The end is the first position after the valley where the balance is zero.

4. The cost is the sum of the lengths of all such segments.

But how to implement this.

Implementation steps:

- First, compute the balance array.

- Find all the negative regions.

- For each negative region, find the left and right boundaries.

Let's see.

How to find the left boundary for a negative region:

The left boundary is the last index before the start of the negative region where the balance is zero.

Similarly, the right boundary is the first index after the end of the negative region where the balance is zero.

For example, in the first valley (positions 0-2), the left boundary is -1 (balance is zero at the start), and the right boundary is 3 (balance becomes zero at position 3).

Thus, the segment is from 0 (left boundary +1) to 3 (right boundary).

Wait, but the left boundary is the position where the balance is zero before the valley. So for the valley starting at position 0, the left boundary is position -1 (balance 0). The right boundary is position 3 (balance 0).

So the segment is [0, 3].

Similarly, for the valley at position 6, the left boundary is position 5 (balance 0), and the right boundary is position 7 (balance 0). So the segment is [6,7].

But how to find these boundaries.

Let's think of the balance array as follows:

balance = [0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]

Wait, no. The initial balance is 0. After each character, we compute the balance.

For the sample input:

The balance array is computed as:

balance[0] = initial balance (0) + (-1) → -1.

balance[1] = -1 + (-1) → -2.

balance[2] = -2 + 1 → -1.

balance[3] = -1 + 1 → 0.

balance[4] = 0 +1 →1.

balance[5] =1 -1 →0.

balance[6] =0-1 →-1.

balance[7] =-1 +1 →0.

So the balance array is [-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0].

The initial balance is 0. Then, after each character, balance is updated.

The negative regions are:

positions 0-2 (balances -1, -2, -1).

positions 6 (balance -1).

For the first negative region (0-2):

We need to find the last position before 0 where the balance is zero. That's position -1 (before the start of the array). Then, the first position after 2 where the balance is zero is position 3.

Thus, the segment is [0,3].

For the second negative region (6):

The last position before 6 where the balance is zero is position 5. The first position after 6 where balance is zero is position7.

Thus, the segment is [6,7].

Summing their lengths: (3-0+1)=4? Wait, 0 to3 is 4 characters. Yes.

So, the algorithm is:

For each negative region [start, end], find the left zero (last position before start where balance is zero) and right zero (first position after end where balance is zero). The segment to reorder is from (left_zero +1) to right_zero.

But wait, how to find left_zero and right_zero.

For example:

For the first negative region (start=0, end=2):

left_zero is the largest index before 0 where balance is zero. Since there are no such indexes (balance before 0 is zero, which is the initial balance), left_zero is -1 (before the array starts).

right_zero is the first index after end (2) where balance is zero. That's index3.

Thus, the segment is 0 to3 (inclusive).

For the second negative region (start=6, end=6):

left_zero is the largest index before6 where balance is zero. That's index5.

right_zero is the first index after6 where balance is zero. That's index7.

Segment is 6-7.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Compute the balance array.

2. Find all the negative regions (consecutive positions where balance <0).

3. For each region:

   a. Find left_zero: the last position before the start of the region where balance is zero. If none exists, use -1 (initial balance).

   b. Find right_zero: the first position after the end of the region where balance is zero.

   c. The segment to reorder is [left_zero +1, right_zero].

4. Merge overlapping segments.

5. Sum the lengths of all segments.

This seems to work for the sample.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Steps:

- Compute the balance array. This is O(n).

- Find all the negative regions. This can be done by iterating through the balance array and recording the start and end indices of each continuous region where balance <0.

- For each negative region [s, e], find left_zero and right_zero.

- left_zero is the largest index <s where balance is zero. If there's no such index, then the initial balance (before the array starts) is zero, so left_zero is -1.

- right_zero is the smallest index >e where balance is zero.

Once left_zero and right_zero are found, the segment is from left_zero +1 to right_zero.

But how to find left_zero and right_zero efficiently.

Since n can be up to 1e6, we need an O(1) or O( log n ) method for each query.

To do this, we can precompute two arrays:

- left_zeros: for each index i, the largest index <i where balance is zero.

- right_zeros: for each index i, the smallest index >i where balance is zero.

These can be computed in O(n) time.

For example:

Compute left_zeros array:

Initialize left_zeros as an array of size n, where left_zeros[i] is the last index before i where balance is zero.

We can build this array by iterating from left to right, keeping track of the last seen zero.

Similarly, compute right_zeros array by iterating from right to left, keeping track of the next zero.

Once these arrays are precomputed, for each negative region [s, e], left_zero is left_zeros[s], and right_zero is right_zeros[e].

But for the initial balance (before index 0), which is zero, how to handle.

For example, for the first negative region starting at s=0:

left_zeros[0] is the last index before 0 where balance is zero. But there are no indices before 0. So we need to handle this case specially.

Thus, for any s=0, the left_zero is -1 (the initial balance).

For other s>0, left_zero is left_zeros[s].

Similarly, for e =n-1 (last index), right_zero is n (the end of the array), but if the balance after the entire array is zero (which it must be), then right_zero is n-1 (since the balance after processing the entire array is zero).

Wait, no. The balance after processing the entire array must be zero, because the counts are equal. So the balance after the last index is zero.

Thus, for any e, the right_zero can be found by looking for the first index after e where balance is zero. If there is no such index (e.g., after e is the end of the array), then right_zero is n (which is the index after the last character, but the balance after processing the entire array is zero).

But how to handle this.

Perhaps, when processing a negative region [s, e], the right_zero is the first index after e where balance is zero, or n (if the balance after processing the entire array is zero, which is the case if the total count is balanced).

Thus, the steps to find right_zero for a given e:

Iterate from e+1 to n-1, and find the first index where balance is zero. If none found, then right_zero is n.

But doing this for each e in a large n would be O(n^2) time, which is not acceptable.

Thus, we need to precompute right_zeros as follows:

Create an array right_zeros of size n, where right_zeros[i] is the smallest index >=i where balance is zero.

Wait, no. For a given e, we need the smallest index >e where balance is zero.

We can precompute this by iterating from right to left, and keeping track of the last zero seen.

For example:

Initialize right_zeros as array of size n, filled with -1.

last_zero = -1

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    if balance[i] ==0:

        last_zero =i

    right_zeros[i] = last_zero

But this way, right_zeros[i] is the smallest index >=i where balance is zero.

Wait, no. If we iterate from right to left:

Initialize last_zero = -1.

For i from n-1 downto 0:

   if balance[i] ==0:

       last_zero =i

   right_zeros[i] = last_zero

Thus, right_zeros[i] is the closest zero to the right of or equal to i.

But when we need the first zero after e, we can set right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]. But if e+1 >=n, then right_zero is n (assuming the balance after the array is zero).

For example:

In the sample input:

For e=2 (end of first negative region), e+1=3.

right_zeros[3] =3.

So right_zero is3.

For e=6 (end of second negative region), e+1=7.

right_zeros[7] =7.

So right_zero is7.

For a case where the negative region ends at position n-1:

e =n-1.

e+1 =n, which is beyond the array. So right_zero is n (balance after the array is zero).

But in the precomputed right_zeros array, for i >=n, we have to handle it specially.

Thus, the algorithm for finding right_zero is:

If e is the last index (n-1), then right_zero is n.

Else, right_zero is right_zeros[e+1]. If right_zeros[e+1] is -1, then check if the balance after the array is zero (which it is), so right_zero is n.

Thus, for the general case:

For a negative region ending at e:

right_zero = right_zeros[e+1] if e+1 <n.

If e+1 >=n, then right_zero =n.

But need to handle cases where right_zeros[e+1] is -1 (no zeros to the right of e+1).

In that case, right_zero is n.

But since the total balance is zero, the balance after processing the entire array is zero. So right_zero can be set to n.

Thus, the algorithm for finding right_zero is:

If e is the last index:

   right_zero =n

Else:

   candidate = right_zeros[e+1]

   if candidate ==-1:

       right_zero =n

   else:

       right_zero = candidate

But how to check if there are no zeros to the right of e+1.

Alternatively, in the precomputed right_zeros array, we can set the value to n if there are no zeros to the right.

But how to precompute that.

Perhaps during the precomputation:

We start with last_zero =n (the balance after the entire array is zero).

Then, iterate from right to left:

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

   if balance[i] ==0:

       last_zero =i

   right_zeros[i] = last_zero

But in this case, for any i, right_zeros[i] is the first zero at or after i. If there are no zeros after i, then last_zero is n.

Wait, no. The balance after the array is zero, so for any i, the right_zeros[i] can be n if there are no zeros between i and n-1.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, during the precomputation of right_zeros:

We can initialize last_zero =n.

Then, iterate from n-1 downto 0:

   if balance[i] ==0:

       last_zero =i

   right_zeros[i] = last_zero

Thus, if after e+1, there are no zeros, then right_zeros[e+1] =n.

Thus, the code for right_zero would be:

right_zero = right_zeros[e+1] if e+1 <n else n.

Thus, for any e, right_zero is right_zeros[e+1], and if e+1 >=n, then right_zero is n.

Similarly, the left_zero for a negative region starting at s is:

if s ==0:

   left_zero =-1 (since the initial balance is zero).

else:

   left_zero = left_zeros[s-1].

Because left_zeros[s-1] is the last zero before s.

For example, in the first negative region s=0:

left_zero is -1.

In the second negative region s=6:

left_zero is left_zeros[5], which would be 5.

Thus, the steps are:

For each negative region [s, e]:

if s ==0:

   left_zero =-1

else:

   left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

right_zero = right_zeros[e+1] if e+1 <n else n.

The segment to reorder is from (left_zero +1) to (right_zero -1). Because:

left_zero is the last index before s where balance is zero. So the start of the segment is left_zero +1.

right_zero is the first index after e where balance is zero. So the end of the segment is right_zero -1 (since the segment must end at the character before the right_zero index).

Wait, no. Because right_zero is the index where balance is zero. So if right_zero is 3, then the segment includes up to index3 (since processing up to index3 gives balance zero).

But in the first sample, the right_zero for the first region is 3. So the segment is from 0 to3, which includes index3.

Thus, the segment is [left_zero +1, right_zero].

For example:

left_zero =-1, right_zero =3.

Segment is 0 to3 (inclusive).

Another example:

left_zero=5, right_zero=7.

Segment is 6 to7.

Thus, the segment is [left_zero +1, right_zero].

Thus, the length of the segment is right_zero - (left_zero +1) +1 = right_zero - left_zero.

So the cost contributed by this segment is (right_zero - left_zero).

Thus, the algorithm for the sample:

First segment:

left_zero =-1, right_zero=3. cost 3 - (-1) =4.

Second segment:

left_zero=5, right_zero=7. cost 7-5=2.

Total cost 6.

Thus, the code should be:

For each negative region [s, e]:

   compute left_zero and right_zero as described.

   the segment is from l = left_zero +1 to r = right_zero.

   the cost is (r - l +1) → which is (right_zero - left_zero).

But wait, (r - l +1) is (right_zero - (left_zero +1) +1) = right_zero - left_zero.

Thus, the cost is (right_zero - left_zero).

Thus, the code can compute this.

Now, the steps to implement:

1. Check if the total number of '(' and ')': if not equal, return -1.

2. Compute balance array.

3. Check if all balances are >=0. If yes, return 0.

4. Precompute left_zeros and right_zeros arrays.

   a. left_zeros[i] is the last index <=i where balance is zero.

   b. right_zeros[i] is the first index >=i where balance is zero, or n if after i there are no zeros (but since total balance is zero, the balance after the array is zero).

   Wait, no. The right_zeros array is precomputed as follows:

   We initialize right_zeros as an array of size n, where right_zeros[i] is the first zero at or after i. If none, then right_zeros[i] =n.

5. Find all the negative regions.

6. For each negative region [s, e]:

   a. compute left_zero:

      if s ==0:

          left_zero =-1

      else:

          left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

   b. compute right_zero:

      if e ==n-1:

          right_zero =n

      else:

          right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]

   c. if left_zero is -1 and right_zero is n:

       then the segment is [0, n-1], cost n.

   d. else:

       the segment is from l = left_zero +1 to r = right_zero -1.

       wait no. Because right_zero is the first zero after e. So the segment should be from l to r = right_zero -1?

       Wait, no. For example, in the first sample:

       right_zero is3. The segment is 0 to3 (inclusive). So the length is 4.

       So the code should be:

       l = left_zero +1

       r = right_zero

       length is r - l +1 = right_zero - (left_zero +1) +1 = right_zero - left_zero.

       So the cost is right_zero - left_zero.

Thus, the code should compute l as left_zero +1, r as right_zero.

But how to handle when right_zero is n.

For example, if e is n-1, then right_zero is n. So the segment would be from l to n-1 (since the entire array is up to n-1).

So, the code can:

l = left_zero +1

r = right_zero

if right_zero ==n:

   r = n-1

Thus, the segment is [l, r], and the cost is r - l +1.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the code can compute the cost as:

cost = right_zero - left_zero.

But when right_zero is n, the actual right index is n-1.

Thus:

cost = (right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1) - (left_zero +1) +1.

Which simplifies to:

if right_zero <n:

   cost = right_zero - (left_zero +1) +1 = right_zero - left_zero.

else:

   cost = (n-1) - (left_zero +1) +1 = (n-1 - left_zero -1 +1) = (n-1 - left_zero -1 +1) = n- left_zero -1.

But this complicates things.

Alternatively, when right_zero is n, then the segment is from l to n-1. So the cost is (n-1 - l +1) = n - l.

But l = left_zero +1.

Thus:

if right_zero ==n:

   cost = n - (left_zero +1) = (n - left_zero -1).

But this is (right_zero - left_zero -1) = (n - left_zero -1).

But earlier formula for cost is right_zero - left_zero.

Which would give n - left_zero.

But when right_zero is n, the cost is (n - left_zero), but the actual cost should be (n - left_zero -1). So there's a discrepancy.

Thus, the initial approach to compute cost as right_zero - left_zero is incorrect when right_zero is n.

Thus, we need to adjust the code for when right_zero is n.

This suggests that the initial approach is not correct, and we need to handle the case where the right_zero is n separately.

But how?

Let's re-examine the sample case where e is the last index.

Suppose the entire array is '))((', n=4. The balance array is [-1, -2, -1, 0]. The negative regions are [0,2].

left_zero for s=0 is -1.

right_zero for e=2 is 3 (since right_zeros[3] is 3).

Thus, the segment is 0-3, cost 4.

But if the array is ')))...((( ' with n even.

Another example: n=2, '))', balance array is [-1, -2]. The total counts are 2 ')', which is invalid. So code returns -1.

But for a valid example: n=4, '))))', then it's invalid.

But assuming counts are equal.

For example, n=4, '() ) ('. Wait, no, not sure.

This suggests that the code needs to handle the case when right_zero is n.

But in that case, the segment is from left_zero+1 to n-1.

Thus, the cost is (n-1 - (left_zero+1) +1) = n-1 - left_zero -1 +1 = n - left_zero -1.

But according to the initial formula, right_zero is n, so cost is n - left_zero.

But this is incorrect.

Thus, the code must handle this case.

Thus, the algorithm for cost:

if right_zero <n:

   cost = right_zero - left_zero

else:

   cost = (n-1) - (left_zero +1) +1 = n-1 - left_zero -1 +1 = n - left_zero -1.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the cost is:

cost = min(right_zero, n-1) - (left_zero +1) +1.

Which simplifies to:

if right_zero <n:

   cost = right_zero - left_zero -1 +1 = right_zero - left_zero.

else:

   cost = (n-1 - left_zero -1) +1 = n-1 - left_zero.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the code can compute the start and end of the segment as:

start = left_zero +1

end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

cost = end - start +1.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code for cost is:

start = left_zero +1

end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

cost += end - start +1.

Thus, for the sample:

start =-1 +1=0

end=3.

cost is 3-0+1=4.

For the second region:

start =5+1=6.

end=7.

cost 7-6+1=2.

Total 6.

For a case where right_zero is n:

start = left_zero +1.

end =n-1.

cost is (n-1) - (left_zero +1) +1 =n-1 - left_zero -1 +1 =n - left_zero -1.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, the algorithm steps:

1. Check if counts are equal.

2. Compute balance array.

3. Check if balance is non-negative everywhere. If yes, return 0.

4. Precompute left_zeros and right_zeros.

   left_zeros[i] is the last index <=i where balance is zero.

   right_zeros[i] is the first index >=i where balance is zero, or n if none (but balance after array is zero).

5. Find all negative regions.

6. For each region [s, e]:

   a. compute left_zero:

      if s ==0: left_zero =-1

      else: left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

   b. compute right_zero:

      if e ==n-1:

          right_zero =n

      else:

          right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]

   c. compute start = left_zero +1

   d. compute end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

   e. if start > end: skip (but this shouldn't happen)

   f. add (end - start +1) to the total cost.

7. Merge overlapping segments to avoid double-counting.

Wait, there's a problem here. If two negative regions are covered by the same segment, they would be counted once. But in the algorithm as described, each negative region would be processed, leading to overlapping segments that are counted multiple times.

Thus, after computing all the segments for each negative region, the code must merge overlapping segments to avoid overlapping cost.

For example, suppose we have two overlapping segments [0,3] and [2,5]. The merged segment is [0,5], cost 6, but if they are counted as separate segments, the cost would be 4+4=8, which is wrong.

Thus, the algorithm must first find all the required segments and then merge overlapping or adjacent ones before summing their lengths.

This complicates things. How to handle overlapping segments.

Thus, the initial approach may count overlapping segments multiple times, leading to incorrect costs.

Thus, the correct approach must find all the required segments and merge them before summing.

But how to ensure that each segment is considered only once.

For example, if two negative regions are covered by a single segment, the code must merge them.

Thus, the steps must be:

- For each negative region, compute the corresponding segment [start, end].

- Merge overlapping segments.

- Sum the lengths of the merged segments.

Thus, the code must first collect all the segments and then merge them.

This is the correct approach.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Collect all the segments as described.

2. Merge overlapping or adjacent segments.

3. Sum the lengths.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For example, two segments [0,3] and [6,7] are non-overlapping, so sum 4+2=6.

If there are overlapping segments like [0,4] and [3,5], merge into [0,5], cost 6.

Thus, the code must:

After collecting all the segments, merge them into a list of non-overlapping, non-adjacent intervals, then sum their lengths.

Thus, the code must:

- Sort the segments by start.

- Iterate through them, merging overlaps.

- Sum the lengths.

But since the segments are generated in the order of the negative regions, which are in order, perhaps the segments are already sorted. But this is not guaranteed.

For example, a negative region in the middle may generate a segment that starts earlier than a previous one. Thus, the code must sort the segments by start time.

Thus, the code must:

Collect all segments in a list, then sort by start, then merge.

This is manageable even for n up to 1e6.

Thus, the code outline is:

Read n and s.

Check counts of '(', ')'. If not equal, return -1.

Compute balance array.

If all balances >=0, return 0.

Precompute left_zeros and right_zeros.

Find all negative regions.

For each region, compute the corresponding segment [start, end].

Add all segments to a list.

Merge overlapping segments.

Sum the lengths.

Return the sum.

Now, implement this in Python.

Let's proceed to code.

First, precompute left_zeros and right_zeros.

Implementing left_zeros:

Initialize left_zeros as a list of size n, filled with -1.

last_zero =-1

for i in range(n):

    if balance[i] ==0:

        last_zero =i

    left_zeros[i] = last_zero

Thus, for any i, left_zeros[i] is the last index <=i where balance is zero.

For right_zeros:

Initialize right_zeros as a list of size n, filled with n.

last_zero =n

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    if balance[i] ==0:

        last_zero =i

    right_zeros[i] = last_zero

Thus, for any i, right_zeros[i] is the first index >=i where balance is zero. If there is no such index in the array, last_zero remains n (indicating that the balance after processing the array is zero).

Then, for each negative region [s, e]:

compute left_zero:

if s ==0:

    left_zero =-1

else:

    left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

compute right_zero:

if e ==n-1:

    right_zero =n

else:

    right_zeros[e+1]

start = left_zero +1

end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

if start > end:

    continue

add [start, end] to the segments list.

After collecting all segments, merge overlapping intervals.

Merge steps:

Sort the segments by start.

Initialize merged list.

For each segment in sorted list:

   if merged list is empty or current segment start > merged[-1].end +1:

       add to merged list

   else:

       merged[-1] end is max(merged[-1].end, current.end)

Thus, merging overlapping or adjacent segments.

Sum the lengths of merged segments.

This will give the minimal cost.

Thus, the code should be:

segments = []

current_negative_start = None

for i in range(n):

    if balance[i] <0:

        if current_negative_start is None:

            current_negative_start = i

    else:

        if current_negative_start is not None:

            current_negative_end = i-1

            # process the negative region [current_negative_start, current_negative_end]

            # compute left_zero

            s = current_negative_start

            e = current_negative_end

            if s ==0:

                left_zero =-1

            else:

                left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

            # compute right_zero

            if e ==n-1:

                right_zero =n

            else:

                right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]

            start = left_zero +1

            end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

            if start <= end:

                segments.append( (start, end) )

            current_negative_start = None

# Handle case where the negative region is at the end of the array

if current_negative_start is not None:

    e =n-1

    s = current_negative_start

    if s ==0:

        left_zero =-1

    else:

        left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

    if e ==n-1:

        right_zero =n

    else:

        right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]

    start = left_zero +1

    end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

    if start <= end:

        segments.append( (start, end) )

# Now merge segments

segments.sort()

merged = []

for seg in segments:

    if not merged:

        merged.append( seg )

    else:

        last_start, last_end = merged[-1]

        current_start, current_end = seg

        if current_start > last_end:

            merged.append( seg )

        else:

            new_start = last_start

            new_end = max(last_end, current_end)

            merged[-1] = (new_start, new_end)

# Sum the lengths

total_cost =0

for (s, e) in merged:

    total_cost += e - s +1

print(total_cost)

But wait, the code for finding the negative regions is incorrect.

Because the balance array is computed, and we need to find all negative regions.

Thus, the code should:

Iterate through the balance array and find all consecutive negative regions.

For example:

balance = [-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]

The negative regions are:

[0, 2], [6,6]

Thus, the code should track start and end of each negative region.

Thus, the code to find negative regions can be:

current_negative_start = None

for i in range(n):

    if balance[i] <0:

        if current_negative_start is None:

            current_negative_start = i

    else:

        if current_negative_start is not None:

            current_negative_end = i-1

            # process this region

            current_negative_start = None

# After loop, check if there's a region at the end

if current_negative_start is not None:

    current_negative_end = n-1

    # process this region

Thus, the code must collect all negative regions.

But in the code above, this is not handled.

Thus, the code must:

Collect all negative regions as a list of [start, end] pairs.

Then, for each [start, end], compute the corresponding segment.

Thus, the code should first collect all negative regions.

Then, process each region.

Thus, the code to collect negative regions:

regions = []

current_start = None

for i in range(n):

    if balance[i] <0:

        if current_start is None:

            current_start = i

    else:

        if current_start is not None:

            regions.append( (current_start, i-1) )

            current_start = None

if current_start is not None:

    regions.append( (current_start, n-1) )

Thus, the regions list contains all the [s, e] of negative regions.

Then, for each region in regions:

compute left_zero, right_zero, start, end.

Add the segment [start, end] to the segments list.

Thus, the code becomes:

After checking the counts and balance:

regions = []

current_start = None

for i in range(n):

    if balance[i] <0:

        if current_start is None:

            current_start = i

    else:

        if current_start is not None:

            regions.append( (current_start, i-1) )

            current_start = None

if current_start is not None:

    regions.append( (current_start, n-1) )

segments = []

for s, e in regions:

    # compute left_zero

    if s ==0:

        left_zero =-1

    else:

        left_zero = left_zeros[s-1]

    # compute right_zero

    if e ==n-1:

        right_zero =n

    else:

        right_zero = right_zeros[e+1]

    start = left_zero +1

    end = right_zero if right_zero <n else n-1

    if start > end:

        continue

    segments.append( (start, end) )

Then, merge the segments and sum.

Thus, the code should work.
