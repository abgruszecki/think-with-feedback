Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about counting the number of complete undirected graphs with n vertices where each edge weight is between 1 and k. The graph is beautiful if two conditions are met: the sum of the weights of all edges incident to vertex 1 equals the weight of the MST of the graph. And we need to find the number of such beautiful graphs modulo 998244353.

First, let's understand the problem step by step. Let's break down the conditions.

The MST in a complete graph. For a complete graph, the MST is the tree that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. But how is the MST determined here? Well, in a complete graph, the MST can be found using Krusky's or Prim's algorithm. But perhaps there's a pattern here.

Wait, but the graph's edge weights can be arbitrary. So the MST will consist of the n-1 edges with the smallest possible weights that connect the graph. Wait, no. Because Krusky's algorithm picks edges in order of increasing weight, adding them if they connect two disjoint components. So the MST of the entire graph will be such that each edge in the MST is the smallest possible for connecting parts of the graph. Hmm. But in a complete graph, the MST is a tree where each node (other than the root) is connected via the smallest possible edge to the current tree. Or maybe the MST can be found by selecting for each node the smallest edge that connects it to the tree. So, perhaps the MST's structure is such that each node (other than 1) is connected to node 1 via its smallest edge. Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Suppose we have vertex 1. For all other vertices, the MST will connect them via the smallest possible edge to the tree. For example, each vertex i (i>1) must have its edge to the MST with the minimum possible weight. But in a complete graph, the minimal edge for connecting a new node to the existing MST would be the smallest edge between that node and any node already in the MST. But perhaps, for the MST to be minimal, each node (other than 1) is connected via its minimal edge to node 1. Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think.

Suppose all edges from vertex 1 to other vertices are the smallest possible. Then, the MST would be the star tree with vertex 1 at the center, and all edges from 1 to others. Because those edges are the smallest possible, any other edge in the graph would be larger, so the MST would be formed by those edges. So the weight of the MST would be the sum of the edges from 1 to all other vertices.

But if any of the edges from 1 to another vertex is not the smallest possible, then perhaps the MST would include some other edges. For example, suppose vertex 2 has a higher edge weight to 1 than the edge between 2 and 3. Then, if the edge between 2 and 3 is part of the MST. But wait, that's not possible if the edge from 1 to 3 is smaller than the edge between 2 and 3. Because then, in Krusky's algorithm, when considering edges in order, the edge from 1 to 3 would be added before 2-3, so 3 would already be connected to 1. Then, when 2 is added via 1-2 (assuming that's the minimal edge for 2), the 2-3 edge would not be needed. So perhaps the MST will have exactly the edges from 1 to each other node, provided that for each node i>1, the edge 1-i is the minimal among all edges that connect i to the current tree (which initially is just 1). But that's only true if for every other node j, the edge 1-j is the minimal in the path from 1 to j. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think with an example.

Take n=3. Suppose edges 1-2 is 2, 1-3 is 3, and 2-3 is 1. Then the MST would have edges 1-2 (2) and 2-3 (1), sum 3. But the sum of edges incident to 1 is 2+3=5. So in this case, the sum is higher than the MST. So in this graph, the MST is formed by 1-2 and 2-3. So the MST sum is 3, but the sum of edges incident to 1 is 5. So this graph is not beautiful.

But according to the first sample input, when n=3 and k=2, the output is 5. So in that case, how do the conditions hold?

Let me think. For the graph to be beautiful, the sum of the edges incident to 1 (which are 1-2 and 1-3) must equal the MST weight.

So in the sample input 3 2, all edges can have weights 1 or 2. Let's see possible cases.

For the MST to have a sum equal to the sum of edges from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3. So the MST must be exactly the edges 1-2 and 1-3. For that to happen, those edges must be the minimal possible in the graph. Because if there's any other edge (like 2-3) with weight less than 1-2 or 1-3, then the MST might include that edge instead. Wait, but for the MST sum to be the sum of the two edges, the MST must consist of those two edges. So in this case, the edges 1-2 and 1-3 must be the two minimal edges in the entire graph. Because any other edge (like 2-3) with weight less than either of those two would allow the MST to have a smaller sum. For example, if 2-3 has weight 1, then the MST would consist of 1-2 (weight 2) and 2-3 (weight 1), sum 3. But the sum of edges incident to 1 would be 2+1 (if 1-3 is 1) plus 1-2's weight. Wait, no. The sum of edges incident to 1 is the sum of all edges connected to 1. So in the example where n=3, that's two edges (1-2 and 1-3). The MST sum would be the sum of the edges in the MST. So for the two to be equal, the MST must consist of exactly those two edges. So the sum of those edges must be equal to the sum of all edges incident to 1. Which they are, because the sum of the edges in the MST (the two edges) is exactly the sum of edges incident to 1.

But for the MST to consist of exactly those two edges, those edges must be the minimal possible. Because if there's any edge in the graph (like 2-3) with a weight less than the maximum of 1-2 and 1-3, then the MST could replace one of those edges with a lower weight. Wait, how?

Let me think again. For the MST to consist of edges 1-2 and 1-3, their weights must be such that all other edges (like 2-3) have weights greater than or equal to the maximum of 1-2 and 1-3. Because if 2-3 has a weight less than that maximum, then during Krusky's algorithm, when considering edges in order, 2-3 (if it's less than the maximum of the two edges) would come before the higher of 1-2 and 1-3. So when that edge is added, would it connect two nodes that are already in the same component? Not necessarily.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose 1-2 is 3, 1-3 is 2, and 2-3 is 1. Then Krusky's algorithm would process edges in order 1 (2-3), then 2 (1-3), then 3 (1-2). The algorithm starts with all nodes as separate. Add 2-3 (weight 1), which connects 2 and 3. Then add 1-3 (weight 2), which connects 1 to the component containing 2 and 3. Now all nodes are connected. The MST has edges 2-3 (1) and 1-3 (2), sum 3. The sum of edges incident to 1 is 3+2=5. So here, the sum is 5, MST sum is 3. So the graph is not beautiful.

But if the edges 1-2 and 1-3 are both 1, and 2-3 is 2. Then the MST is the two edges 1-2 and 1-3, sum 2. The sum of edges incident to 1 is 2. So it's equal. So in this case, the graph is beautiful.

So the condition for the graph to be beautiful is that the MST is exactly the edges connected to vertex 1 (i.e., the star centered at 1), and the sum of those edges equals the sum of all edges incident to 1 (which is naturally the case). So the problem reduces to counting all graphs where the MST is exactly the star centered at 1, and the sum of the edges in the star is equal to the sum of all edges incident to 1 (which is always true for the star).

Wait, no. Because the sum of the edges in the MST (the star) is exactly the sum of the edges incident to 1. So the condition is that the sum of edges incident to 1 is equal to the sum of the MST's edges. But since the MST is the star, the sum of the MST is the sum of the edges from 1 to all other nodes. So the two are equal. So the problem's condition is satisfied if and only if the MST is exactly the star centered at 1, and the sum of the edges in that star is equal to the sum of all edges incident to 1. Which is always the case, since the star's edges are exactly the edges incident to 1. Wait, no. The edges incident to 1 include all edges connected to 1, which in a complete graph are (n-1) edges. The star is those (n-1) edges, so the sum of the MST's edges is the sum of those edges. The sum of edges incident to 1 is the same sum. So the condition is automatically satisfied if the MST is the star. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of complete graphs where the MST is the star centered at 1.

So the problem is equivalent to counting all graphs where the edges from 1 to each other node are the minimal possible in such a way that for every other node i, the edge 1-i is the minimal edge in the entire graph that connects i to the MST.

Wait, maybe another way to think: the MST is the star if and only if for every other node i, the edge 1-i is the smallest edge in any cycle involving i and the path through the existing MST. Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let's think in terms of Krusky's algorithm.

In Krusky's algorithm, edges are processed in order of increasing weight. For each edge, if it connects two components that are not yet connected, it is added to the MST.

In the case of the star MST, the edges 1-i must be the minimal edges for connecting each node i to the rest of the tree. So for each node i, the edge 1-i must be the minimal edge between i and the component containing 1 (which, once 1 is connected to some nodes, grows as edges are added).

But when processing edges in order of increasing weight, the first edge to connect 1 to any other node (say, 1-2) will be part of the MST. Then, when considering edges to 3, the minimal edge between 3 and the current MST (which includes 1 and 2) must be 1-3. Otherwise, if 3-2 is a lower weight than 1-3, then 3-2 would be added to the MST instead. So for the star to be the MST, all edges 1-i must be strictly less than any edge between i and any other node in the graph. Wait, no. Because even if some other edge j-k (where j and k are not 1) have a lower weight than some edges 1-i, but those j and k are connected through 1 in the MST, then j-k would not be added.

Alternatively, the MST will be a star if for every node i (i !=1), the edge 1-i is the minimum weight among all edges that connect i to the component of 1 when processing edges. So during Krusky's algorithm, the first edge that connects i to the component of 1 must be 1-i, and that edge's weight must be the minimal possible.

Alternatively, to ensure that the MST is the star, for each node i>1, the edge 1-i must be the smallest edge in all edges that are incident to i. Because if there's another node j where the edge i-j has a smaller weight than 1-i, then in Krusky's algorithm, the edge i-j could be considered before 1-i, allowing i and j to be connected before i is connected to 1. Then, if the edge 1-j is larger than i-j, when processing the edge 1-j, it would connect j (already connected to i) to 1. So the MST would have edges i-j (weight less than 1-i) and 1-j (possibly higher than i-j?), but wait, no. Let's see.

Suppose i=2, j=3. Edge 2-3 has weight 1, edge 1-2 has weight 2, edge 1-3 has weight 3. Then the order of processing edges would be 2-3 (1), then 1-2 (2), then 1-3 (3). Krusky's algorithm would add 2-3 (connects 2 and 3), then 1-2 (connects 1 to 2-3 component). The MST sum is 1+2=3. The sum of edges incident to 1 is 2+3=5. So this graph is not beautiful. But the MST is not a star. So to have the MST be a star, for each node i>1, the edge 1-i must be the minimal weight among all edges incident to i. Because if any other edge connected to i has a lower weight, then during Krusky's algorithm, that edge would be considered first and could form a connection that bypasses the 1-i edge.

Wait, perhaps not. Suppose node i is connected to j (not 1) via a lower weight edge than 1-i. Then, during Krusky's algorithm, if i and j are not connected yet, that edge would be added. But then, if j's minimal edge to 1 is higher than that edge, perhaps the MST would include the edge i-j and 1-j (if 1-j's weight is higher than i-j's). Wait, but that's possible.

Alternatively, for the MST to be a star, it's necessary that for every i>1, the edge 1-i is the minimal edge in the entire graph that connects i to any other node. Because if there's another edge j-i that is smaller than 1-i, then when Krusky's algorithm processes j-i, it would add that edge to the MST, connecting i and j. Then, when processing 1-i, which is higher than j-i, the edge would not be added if i is already connected to j. So the MST would have j-i as part of the tree, leading to the sum of the MST being less than the sum of edges incident to 1.

Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the MST to be the star centered at 1 is that for every i>1, all edges between i and any other node (except 1) have a weight that is at least the weight of the edge 1-i. Because if this is the case, then during Krusky's algorithm, the edges 1-i will be the first edges that connect each i to the component containing 1, ensuring that the MST is a star.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of graphs where:

1. For each i in 2..n, the edge between 1 and i (let's call this w_i) is chosen as a value between 1 and k.

2. For every pair of nodes j and i (both >1), the edge between j and i must have a weight >= max(w_j, w_i).

Because this ensures that all edges between non-1 nodes have weights >= the weights of their respective 1-node edges. Therefore, during Krusky's algorithm, the edges 1-i will be the first edges to connect each i to the component of 1, forming the star.

So the problem now becomes: count all possible assignments of weights to the edges such that:

- All edges from 1 to i (for i>1) have w_i between 1 and k.

- All edges between i and j (i,j>1) have weight >= max(w_i, w_j).

The answer is the number of such graphs.

So the first step is to model the problem in terms of these constraints.

Let's think of the edges in the graph:

- The edges from 1 to other nodes (n-1 edges). Each can be chosen as any value between 1 and k. Let's denote the values as w_2, w_3, ..., w_n.

- For each pair i < j (both >1), the edge (i,j) must have a weight >= max(w_i, w_j).

Each of these edges (i,j) can be any integer from max(w_i, w_j) to k. So the number of choices for each (i,j) is (k - max(w_i, w_j) + 1).

Thus, the total number of beautiful graphs is the sum over all possible w_2, w_3, ..., w_n (each from 1 to k) of the product for all i < j (i,j>1) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) + 1).

The key is to compute this sum efficiently.

But with n up to 250, the number of variables (n-1 variables, each up to k=250) would be O(k^{n-1}), which is impossible for n=250 and k=250. So we need a smarter way.

We need to find a way to compute the sum over all possible w_2, w_3, ..., w_{n} of the product over all i<j (i,j >=2) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1).

Let's think of the variables w_2, w_3, ..., w_n. For each possible assignment of these variables, the product is the product for each pair (i,j) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1). So this can be rewritten as the product over all pairs (i,j) (i<j) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1).

But how can we compute this sum efficiently?

We can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track some information about the current set of variables. Since the variables are ordered (w_2, w_3, ..., w_n), perhaps we can process them one by one, and track the maximum up to each step.

But considering that for each new variable, we need to track the maximum between it and all previous variables, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the counts of sequences where the maximum is a certain value.

Alternatively, note that the product term for a new variable w_m (when adding the m-th node) depends on the maximum between w_m and each existing variable in the set {w_2, ..., w_{m-1}}.

Let me think of the process of building the variables step by step. Suppose we have already chosen variables w_2, ..., w_{m-1}, and now we add w_m. The product for pairs (i, m) where i < m is the product for i from 2 to m-1 of (k - max(w_i, w_m) + 1). Also, when adding w_m, the existing pairs (i, j) for i < j < m have already been accounted for. So the total product can be built incrementally.

So, the key idea is to model the dynamic programming state as the current count of sequences of variables (w_2, ..., w_{m}), and for each state, track some parameters that allow us to compute the product for the next step.

But what parameters are needed?

When adding the m-th variable (w_m), the product for all pairs (i, m) where i ranges from 2 to m-1 is the product of (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1) for each i. But if we know the maximum of the existing variables (w_2, ..., w_{m-1}), then for each possible value of w_m, the term for each pair (i, m) is (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1). However, since the existing variables have their own maximum, perhaps we can find a way to model this.

Wait, but the existing variables could have different values. For example, if the existing variables are [2, 3, 5], their maximum is 5. When adding a new variable w_m, the product for the new pairs (each existing i with m) is product of (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1). This depends on each individual w_i and w_m, not just the maximum of existing variables. So tracking the maximum of existing variables might not be sufficient.

This suggests that the problem is not manageable with a simple DP that tracks just the maximum. But perhaps there's a way to model this using combinatorics.

Alternatively, think about all possible sequences of variables w_2, w_3, ..., w_n. Each variable can be from 1 to k. The product is the product over all pairs i < j (i,j >=2) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) + 1).

Let’s consider that for each pair (i, j), the term is (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1). The product can be rewritten as the product for all possible a >= 1, (k - a +1) raised to the number of pairs where max(w_i, w_j) = a.

So the product is the product over a from 1 to k of (k - a +1)^{count(a)}, where count(a) is the number of pairs (i,j) (i < j) where max(w_i, w_j) = a.

So, if we can compute for each possible a, how many pairs (i,j) have max(w_i, w_j) = a, then the product is the product of (k - a + 1) raised to that count.

But how can we model this for all possible sequences?

Alternatively, note that for each pair (i,j), the term depends on the maximum of their two variables. So, for a given sequence of variables, the product is the product for all a from 1 to k of (k -a +1)^c_a, where c_a is the number of pairs (i,j) where the maximum of their variables is exactly a.

But how can we compute the sum over all possible sequences of variables of the product of (k -a +1)^c_a for all a?

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model it using dynamic programming by considering the variables in order and tracking certain parameters.

Let me consider that the variables are added in a particular order, say, w_2, then w_3, up to w_n. For each new variable w_m added, when we add it, we have to account for all pairs (i, m) where i ranges from 2 to m-1. The term for each such pair is (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1). The product of these terms for the new pairs is the product over i < m of (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1).

Suppose we have a DP state that represents the current set of variables (w_2, ..., w_{m-1}) with some parameters. Then, for each possible choice of w_m, the contribution of the new pairs is the product of (k - max(w_prev, w_m) +1) for each w_prev in the previous variables. However, for m up to 250, and variables up to 250, this could be manageable if we can find a way to model the parameters efficiently.

Wait, but for each new variable w_m, the product over previous variables is the product of (k - max(w_prev, w_m) +1) for each w_prev. So for each new w_m, the product is the product of (k - max(x, w_m) +1) for each x in the previous variables.

If we can model the previous variables as a multiset of values, then the product for the new variable would be the product over all x in the multiset of (k - max(x, w_m) +1). But even this seems challenging, as the multiset can have many elements.

But perhaps, if we track for each possible value of the maximum of the previous variables, and the count of variables with certain values, then maybe the product can be computed based on that.

Alternatively, notice that for a new variable w_m added, the product for each existing variable x is (k - max(x, w_m) +1). Let's split this into two cases: when x <= w_m and x > w_m.

If x <= w_m, then max(x, w_m) = w_m. So the term is (k - w_m +1).

If x > w_m, then max(x, w_m) = x. So the term is (k -x +1).

So for each existing variable x in the previous variables, the contribution is (k - max(x, w_m) +1) = (k - x +1) if x > w_m, else (k - w_m +1).

So the product for adding w_m is:

prod_{x in previous} [ (k - x +1) if x > w_m else (k - w_m +1) ]

This can be rewritten as:

product_{x > w_m} (k -x +1) * product_{x <= w_m} (k -w_m +1) 

= [product_{x > w_m} (k -x +1)] * (k -w_m +1)^{count_leq(w_m)} 

where count_leq(w_m) is the number of previous variables x with x <= w_m.

But how to model this in a dynamic programming approach?

Suppose we have a DP state that keeps track of the maximum value among the previous variables and the count of variables with x <= current w_m, but that seems insufficient. Alternatively, perhaps track for each possible current maximum and the number of variables, but that might not capture the necessary information.

Alternatively, suppose that when adding a new variable w_m, the important parameters are:

- the maximum of all previous variables, say, M_prev.

- the number of previous variables greater than w_m (since their product term is (k -x +1)), but how?

Wait, for the product, the variables x > w_m contribute (k -x +1), and variables x <= w_m contribute (k -w_m +1). However, when adding a new variable w_m, the variables x can be in the previous set, but their values could be varying.

But if the previous variables' maximum is M_prev, then for w_m >= M_prev, all previous variables are <= w_m. Thus, the product for the new pairs would be (k -w_m +1)^{m_prev}, where m_prev is the number of previous variables. Because for all x in previous variables (all x <= M_prev <= w_m), the contribution is (k -w_m +1).

If w_m < M_prev, then some previous variables are greater than w_m (those that were >= M_prev, but M_prev is the maximum, so they are exactly M_prev). So in this case, the number of variables x > w_m is the number of variables in the previous set that are equal to M_prev (since M_prev is the maximum, and thus all variables <= M_prev). Wait, no. For example, if the previous variables are [3,5,5], M_prev is 5. If w_m is 4, then variables x=5 are greater than w_m. So the number of variables x > w_m is the count of variables in previous that are > w_m.

But when M_prev is the maximum of previous variables, then any variable x > w_m must be <= M_prev. So if M_prev <= w_m, then all x in previous are <= w_m, so count_gt =0. If M_prev > w_m, then count_gt is the number of variables in previous that are >= M_prev (since M_prev is the maximum). Wait, no. For example, previous variables could have maximum M_prev, but have some variables less than M_prev. For instance, previous variables are [2, 3,5], maximum is 5. If w_m is 4, then variables x=5 are greater than w_m. The count_gt is 1 (the 5). So in this case, the variables x > w_m are those equal to M_prev, since M_prev is the maximum. So when adding a new variable w_m which is less than M_prev, the count_gt is the number of variables in previous that are equal to M_prev.

But this is not necessarily true. Suppose previous variables are [3,4,5], M_prev is 5. Then w_m is 4. Variables greater than w_m are 5. So count_gt is 1. But if previous variables are [5,5,5], M_prev is 5, and w_m is 4, count_gt is 3.

Ah, so in this case, the count_gt is the number of variables in previous set that are equal to M_prev, since M_prev is the maximum of previous variables and w_m < M_prev. So for any previous variable x, x is <= M_prev. So x > w_m iff x = M_prev and M_prev > w_m. So, if M_prev > w_m, then the count_gt is the number of variables in previous set equal to M_prev.

So the product for adding w_m is:

If w_m >= M_prev:

prod = (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev}

Else (w_m < M_prev):

prod = (k - M_prev +1)^{count_M_prev} * (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev - count_M_prev}

Because variables equal to M_prev contribute (k - M_prev +1) (since they are greater than w_m), and variables less than M_prev (which are all <= w_m, since M_prev is the previous maximum and w_m < M_prev) contribute (k - w_m +1).

Wait, but variables less than M_prev can be <= w_m. For example, if previous variables are [3,5,5], M_prev=5, and w_m=4. Then variables 3 is <= w_m (3 <=4), so they contribute (k -4 +1). The variables 5 are >4, so they contribute (k-5+1).

So the product is (k-5+1)^2 (for the two 5s) multiplied by (k-4+1)^1 (for the 3) multiplied by (k-4+1) for the new pairs with w_m=4.

So in general, when adding w_m:

Case 1: w_m >= M_prev. Then, all previous variables are <= w_m (since M_prev is the previous maximum). So the product is (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev}.

Case 2: w_m < M_prev. Then, the previous variables can be split into those equal to M_prev (count_M_prev variables) and those less than M_prev (m_prev - count_M_prev variables). Variables equal to M_prev are greater than w_m, so their contribution is (k - M_prev +1)^{count_M_prev}. Variables less than M_prev are <= w_m (since M_prev is the maximum of previous variables and w_m < M_prev implies that variables less than M_prev are <= M_prev -1, which could be <= w_m or not). Wait, no. For example, previous variables could have values like 3 and 5, with M_prev=5. Then w_m=4. Variables less than M_prev are 3, which is <=4. So in general, when w_m < M_prev, variables less than M_prev are <= M_prev -1. So if w_m is less than M_prev, then variables less than M_prev could be <= or > than w_m. Wait, this complicates things.

So in case 2, when w_m < M_prev, variables less than M_prev can be either <= w_m or > w_m. For example, previous variables could have maximum M_prev=5, and variables like 3 and 4, then w_m=4. Then variables 3 is <= w_m, variable 4 is equal to w_m, and variables 5 are greater than w_m. So the variables less than M_prev can have values up to M_prev-1, which may be greater than w_m.

This suggests that the previous approach is not correct, and that tracking only M_prev and count_M_prev is insufficient. Because variables less than M_prev can be greater than w_m, leading to their terms being (k -x +1) instead of (k -w_m +1).

This seems like a major problem. It implies that for each new variable added, the product for the new pairs depends on how many previous variables are greater than w_m, which is not captured by just knowing M_prev and count_M_prev.

Thus, the DP state needs to track more information. For example, we might need to track for each possible current maximum and the count of variables with each possible value. But with n up to 250 and k up to 250, this could become feasible.

Let's think of a DP approach where the state is (m, a, b), where m is the number of variables chosen so far (w_2 to w_m), a is the current maximum among those variables, and b is the count of variables equal to a. However, this may not be sufficient. For example, variables less than a may have values that could be greater than a new w_m. So even if the current maximum is a, there could be variables with values higher than the new w_m but less than a. But this is impossible because the current maximum is a, so all variables are <= a. So if the new w_m is less than a, then variables can be <= a. So variables less than a can be >= w_m or not.

Wait, for example, current variables are [3,5,5], maximum a=5. Adding w_m=4. Then, variables 3 is <4, 5 and 5 are >4. So the product for the new pairs is (3-5+1)^2 (but wait, k is up to 250, but in this example, 5 can be larger than k. So perhaps the variables are constrained by k).

Wait, no. The variables are chosen between 1 and k. So in the problem, all variables w_i are between 1 and k. So the maximum a can't exceed k.

So when the current maximum is a, all variables are <=a. So when adding a new w_m which is less than a, then variables in the current set can be greater than w_m (if they are >=w_m+1, up to a). But the current variables can have various values between 1 and a.

So to compute the product for the new pairs, we need to know, for each x in the current variables, whether x is greater than w_m. The product is then the product of (k - max(x, w_m) +1) for each x in the current variables.

But max(x, w_m) is x if x >w_m, else w_m.

So for each x in current variables:

if x > w_m: term is (k -x +1)

else: term is (k -w_m +1)

So the product for adding w_m is the product over x in current variables of these terms.

But how can we model this in a DP state?

Alternative idea: when building the variables step by step, for each step m (number of variables added so far), track the current maximum a and a frequency array that counts the number of variables with each possible value from 1 to a. But with a up to k and m up to 250, this seems possible.

But with m up to 250 and a up to 250, and frequency counts for each value, this would be very memory-intensive. For example, the state would need to track for each possible a, and for each possible frequency distribution of variables. This is not feasible.

Another approach: realize that the product for the new pairs when adding w_m can be computed based on the current maximum a and the number of variables that are greater than w_m. Because:

If the current maximum is a, then variables can be of any value up to a. When adding w_m, variables greater than w_m contribute (k -x +1) for x in their values. Variables <= w_m contribute (k -w_m +1).

But to compute this product, you need to know how many variables are greater than w_m and the sum of (k -x +1) for each of them. Wait, no. Because each variable contributes a multiplicative factor, not additive. So it's the product of (k -x +1) for variables x > w_m and (k -w_m +1) for variables x <=w_m.

But the product depends on the product of (k -x +1) for x >w_m. So if the current variables have values x1, x2, ..., x_{m_prev}, then the product is:

prod_{x_i > w_m} (k -x_i +1) * (k -w_m +1)^{m_prev - count_gt}

where count_gt is the number of x_i > w_m.

But how to compute this without knowing all the individual x_i's? That's the crux.

Maybe the solution is to model the DP state in terms of the current maximum a and a multiset of variables. But even then, it's not clear.

Alternative idea: when adding a new variable w, for each possible value of w, and for each possible current state (which includes the maximum a and some information about the variables), compute the new contribution.

But what information about the variables is needed? For example, for a current maximum a, and variables in the current set, perhaps we need to track:

- For each possible value v (<=a), the number of variables equal to v.

But with a up to 250, this would require a state with O(k) parameters, which is manageable for small k (like up to 250), but combined with m up to 250, this would be O(m * k * ...), which might be possible.

So let's model the DP as follows:

Define dp[m][a][c] as the number of ways to choose m variables (w_2, ..., w_{m+1}) with maximum value a, and with a frequency array c, where c[v] is the count of variables equal to v. But this is not feasible due to the high dimensionality.

Alternative approach: Notice that when adding a new variable w_m, the product term for the pairs between w_m and previous variables can be expressed as the product over all previous variables x of (k - max(x, w_m) +1). This product can be written as (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev} multiplied by the product over all x > w_m of [(k -x +1)/(k - w_m +1)]^{count(x)}.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, for the product term when adding w_m, it's equivalent to:

prod_{x in previous} (k - max(x, w_m) +1) = (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev - count_gt} * product_{x > w_m} (k -x +1)

where count_gt is the number of previous variables x > w_m.

But the product over x> w_m of (k -x +1) depends on which variables are greater than w_m.

So, if we can track for each possible current state the product of (k -x +1) for all variables x in the current set that are greater than a certain value, then this could be manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the DP state in terms of the current maximum and the product of (k -x +1) for all variables x that are greater than some value.

But this is vague. Let's think differently. Let's consider that the variables are added in order. When adding the m-th variable (w_m), the product for the new pairs is:

prod_{i=1 to m-1} (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1).

The total product for the entire sequence is the product of all these terms for each added variable.

The total number of variables is (n-1) variables (since n can be up to 250), and each step involves choosing a new variable w_m (from 1 to k) and computing the product for the new pairs.

Thus, the problem can be viewed as building a sequence of variables step by step, and for each step, accumulating the product of terms that depend on previous variables and the new variable.

This suggests that a dynamic programming approach is feasible, where the state tracks the current maximum and the product of certain terms up to that point.

But what parameters are necessary to compute the product for the next step?

Let’s try to model the DP state as follows:

- dp[m][a] = the sum of all possible products for m variables with maximum value a.

But how to compute this?

For each new variable w_{m+1}, which can be from 1 to k:

Case 1: w_{m+1} > a.

Then, the new maximum is w_{m+1}.

The product term for the new pairs is (k - w_{m+1} +1)^m (since all previous variables are <= a < w_{m+1}, so max is w_{m+1} for each pair).

So the contribution to dp[m+1][w_{m+1}] is dp[m][a] * (k -w_{m+1} +1)^m.

Case 2: w_{m+1} <= a.

The new maximum remains a.

The product term for the new pairs is the product over all previous variables x of (k - max(x, w_{m+1}) +1).

But how can we compute this product?

This requires knowing how many previous variables x are greater than w_{m+1}.

Let’s split the previous variables into those greater than w_{m+1} and those <= w_{m+1}.

For variables x > w_{m+1}, the term is (k -x +1).

For variables x <= w_{m+1}, the term is (k -w_{m+1} +1).

So the product is (k -w_{m+1} +1)^{count_leq} * product_{x > w_{m+1}} (k -x +1).

But the variables x are part of the previous state, which has maximum a. So if the previous maximum is a, then x <=a.

Thus, variables x >w_{m+1} must be in the range (w_{m+1}, a].

But how to track the count of such variables and the product of (k -x +1) for them?

This seems impossible with the current state parameters (m and a). Thus, the previous approach is insufficient.

So, perhaps we need to track more information in the DP state.

Let’s consider the following parameters for the DP state:

- The number of variables chosen so far (m).

- The current maximum value (a).

- For each value v, the number of variables equal to v. But this is not feasible for large k.

Alternative idea: track the current maximum a, and for each possible v <=a, track how many variables are equal to v. However, for a up to 250, this would require a lot of parameters. For example, for a=250, the state would need to track 250 counts, which is not feasible.

Alternative approach inspired by combinatorics: the product for the new pairs when adding w_m can be expressed as follows.

Suppose the previous variables have maximum a. When adding a new variable w_m, which is <= a:

The product is (k - w_m +1)^{m_prev - cnt_gt} multiplied by the product of (k -x +1) for all x in previous variables that are > w_m.

But how can we compute the product of (k -x +1) for x > w_m? If we track, for the current state, the product of (k -x +1) for all x in the current variables that are greater than w_m.

But this seems to vary for different w_m, so it's not clear.

Alternative idea inspired by multiplicative functions: let's precompute for each possible a and w, the contribution to the product when adding a new variable w.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternative approach: Let's note that the product for all pairs (i,j) (i<j) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1) can be rewritten as the product over all possible a from 1 to k of (k -a +1)^{c_a}, where c_a is the number of pairs where the maximum is a.

The problem is to compute the sum over all possible assignments of variables (w_2, ..., w_n) of the product for all a of (k -a +1)^{c_a}.

But how to compute this sum?

An alternative mathematical approach: the variables w_2, ..., w_n can be thought of as a sequence of values. For each pair (i,j), the term (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1) depends on the maximum of the two variables. The product is over all such pairs.

We can model this problem using inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.

Let me think of it as follows: for each pair (i,j), the term is (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1). This can be viewed as a multiplicative function over the pairs. So the total sum is the product of these terms over all pairs, summed over all possible assignments of the variables.

The key insight is that this product can be expressed in a way that allows for dynamic programming by considering the variables in a certain order.

Let’s consider the variables in order. For each new variable added, we multiply the product by the terms involving this variable and all previous variables.

For example, when adding the m-th variable (w_m), the product is multiplied by the product of (k - max(w_i, w_m) +1) for all i < m.

This suggests that we can model the DP state as a function that tracks the necessary information to compute the product contribution of a new variable.

Now, for the DP state, we can track:

- The current maximum a among the variables processed so far.

- For each possible a, track how many variables are there with each possible value.

But this is not feasible for large a and m.

Alternative approach: For each step m, and for each possible maximum a, track the number of ways to choose m variables with maximum a, and the product of the terms for the pairs involving these variables.

The product can be factored into two parts: the product of pairs among the first m variables, and the product of pairs involving the new variable and the first m variables.

But this is unclear.

Let me think differently. Suppose we have variables w_1, w_2, ..., w_m (with m = n-1). The product is the product over all 1 <= i < j <= m of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1).

We can model the variables in a sorted order. For example, suppose we sort the variables in non-decreasing order. Then, for each variable w_j, when we add it to the sorted list, the maximum of w_j and all previous variables is w_j. But this is only true if the variables are sorted. However, the variables are not necessarily added in sorted order. But perhaps we can find a way to model this regardless.

Alternatively, note that the product of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1) over all pairs (i,j) is the same regardless of the order of the variables. So the order in which variables are added does not affect the product. This allows us to process the variables in any order, such as in sorted order.

But how does this help?

Suppose we process the variables in non-decreasing order. For each new variable w_m (which is the maximum so far, since we're processing in order), the product contribution is the product of (k - w_m +1) for all previous variables (since for each previous variable w_i, max(w_i, w_m) = w_m). So when adding the m-th variable (which is the current maximum), the contribution to the product is (k -w_m +1)^{m-1}.

But this is only true if the variables are processed in non-decreasing order. If the variables are not processed in this order, the product is different. However, since the variables are not ordered, perhaps we can find a way to count the number of permutations and multiply by the product accordingly.

Alternatively, the variables can be grouped by their values. Let's say that the variables are sorted as w_1 <= w_2 <= ... <= w_m. Then, the product is the product for each i < j of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1). Since the variables are sorted, max(w_i, w_j) = w_j for i < j. So the product becomes product_{j=2 to m} product_{i=1 to j-1} (k -w_j +1).

But wait, this is only true if the variables are sorted in non-decreasing order. So for each pair (i,j), if i < j in the sorted list, then max(w_i, w_j) is w_j. So the product becomes product_{j=1 to m} (k -w_j +1)^{j-1} }, where j-1 is the number of pairs (i,j) in the sorted list.

But this would be the case for the sorted list. However, the problem allows variables to be in any order, not just sorted. So the product is the same for all permutations of a given multiset of variables. For example, any permutation of the sorted variables will have the same product.

Wait, no. For example, variables [2,3] have product (k -3 +1) for the pair (2,3). If sorted in reverse order [3,2], the product is (k -3 +1). So the product is the same. So the product is determined by the multiset of variables, not their order. Because max(w_i, w_j) is the same regardless of the order of i and j. So the product depends only on the multiset of variables.

This is a crucial observation. The product over all pairs (i,j) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1) depends only on the multiset of variables and not on their order. Therefore, we can model the problem by considering multisets of variables and their contributions.

Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of multisets of (n-1) variables (each between 1 and k) such that the product over all pairs (i,j) (i<j) of (k - max(w_i, w_j) +1) is the product for that multiset. The sum over all such multisets of their contributions multiplied by the number of permutations that yield that multiset.

Wait, no. Because each multiset corresponds to exactly one product value, and the number of sequences (ordered) that form that multiset is the multinomial coefficient.

But we need to count all ordered sequences (variables can be in any order), but each sequence's product is the same as the product for the sorted version. So for a given multiset, the product is fixed. The number of ordered sequences that correspond to that multiset is the multinomial coefficient. For example, if the multiset has counts c_1, c_2, ..., c_k (summing to n-1), then the number of ordered sequences is (n-1)! / (c_1! c_2! ... c_k!).

But this complicates things, as we now have to sum over all possible multisets, compute the product for the multiset, and multiply by the number of ordered sequences that correspond to it.

But this seems manageable.

So the total answer is the sum over all possible multisets S of size (n-1), each element between 1 and k, of:

(product_{i < j} (k - max(s_i, s_j) +1)) * (number of ordered sequences that generate multiset S).

The number of ordered sequences is ( (n-1)! ) / ( product_{v=1}^k (c_v! ) ), where c_v is the count of v in S.

But how can we compute this sum efficiently?

The product for the multiset S can be computed as follows. Since the variables are sorted in non-decreasing order, the product is product_{j=1 to m} (k - s_j +1)^{ (j-1) }, where m = n-1. Because for each variable s_j, it is the maximum in j-1 pairs (with all variables before it in the sorted list).

So for a multiset S with elements s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_m, the product is product_{j=1}^m (k - s_j +1)^{j-1}.

So, the answer is the sum over all possible sorted sequences s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_{m} of (product_{j=1}^m (k -s_j +1)^{j-1}) ) multiplied by the multinomial coefficient (m! / product (c_v! )), where c_v is the count of each v in the multiset.

But the multinomial coefficient here is the number of ordered sequences that correspond to the multiset S. So for each multiset S, the total contribution is (product) * (m! / product c_v! ), where m is the number of variables (n-1).

Thus, the problem is now to compute the sum over all possible sorted sequences of m variables (each between 1 and k) of the product for the sequence multiplied by the multinomial coefficient.

This seems like a manageable problem, but how?

This suggests that we can model the problem using dynamic programming where we build the sorted sequence one element at a time, and track the required parameters.

Let's consider building the sorted sequence incrementally. Let’s think of the variables in non-decreasing order. The variables are added one by one, and each new variable is greater than or equal to the previous one.

At each step j (1-based), we choose a value s_j >= s_{j-1} (where s_0 is 0). The product for the first j variables is the product for the first j-1 variables multiplied by (k - s_j +1)^{j-1} (because when s_j is added, it forms j-1 new pairs with the previous variables, and the max in each of those pairs is s_j).

The multinomial coefficient can be handled by tracking the counts of each value. However, this might not be necessary if we can find a way to compute the sum using combinations.

Let’s model the DP state as follows:

dp[j][a] = sum over all sequences of j variables (s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_j) with s_j = a of (product_{t=1}^j (k -s_t +1)^{t-1}) * (j! / product_{v} c_v! )).

Then, the transition would be: for each dp[j][a], we can add a new variable b >= a. The new product is multiplied by (k -b +1)^j. The multinomial coefficient for the new sequence would be multiplied by ( (j+1) / (c_b +1) ), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, since the multinomial coefficient is the number of ways to permute the variables, which is (m! / product c_v! ), perhaps we can model the DP as follows:

The DP state is dp[j][a], which represents the sum over all sequences of j variables where the last variable is a, and the variables are sorted in non-decreasing order. For each such sequence, the value stored is the product of the terms up to j variables multiplied by the multinomial coefficient for the sequence.

But this is still not clear.

Alternative approach inspired by combinatorics:

The multinomial coefficient for a sorted sequence with counts c_1, c_2, ..., c_k is (m! ) / (product c_i! ), where m is the number of variables. This accounts for the number of ways to permute the variables to form different sequences.

For the product term, which is product_{j=1}^m (k -s_j +1)^{j-1}, where s_j is the j-th variable in the sorted list.

But how to combine this with the multinomial coefficient.

Let’s think of the problem as a generating function. For each variable added to the sorted sequence, we have to choose a value a >= previous, and multiply by (k -a +1)^{j-1} and account for the multinomial coefficient.

But how?

Perhaps, when adding a new variable a to a sequence of length j-1 (with last value b <=a), the new multinomial coefficient is (j! ) / (c_1! ... c_{a}! ), where c_i are the counts after adding a.

But this seems difficult to model.

Alternative Idea:

Let’s forget about the multinomial coefficient for a moment and think of the problem as building the sorted sequence. The product for the sorted sequence is product_{j=1}^m (k -a_j +1)^{j-1}, where a_j is the j-th variable in the sorted list. For each such sorted sequence, we need to multiply by the number of permutations of the multiset {a_1, a_2, ..., a_m}.

The number of permutations is m! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each a_j.

So, perhaps we can model the DP state as follows:

dp[j][a] represents the sum of (product up to j steps) multiplied by the inverse of the product of factorials of counts so far.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, think of the DP state as tracking the current sorted sequence and the counts of each value, but this is again unmanageable.

Alternative Idea:

The number of permutations of a multiset with counts c_1, c_2, ..., c_k is (m! ) / (prod c_i! ). We can model this by multiplying by m! and dividing by the product of c_i! for each step.

But how to model the division by the product of c_i! during the DP transitions.

Let’s consider the following:

The initial state is j=0, and the sum is 1 (empty sequence).

For each step j from 1 to m:

   For each possible a from 1 to k:

      For each possible previous maximum b <= a:

          The contribution to dp[j][a] is dp[j-1][b] * (k -a +1)^{j-1} * (1 / (c_a + 1) )) ), where c_a is the count of a in the current sequence.

But this seems not manageable.

Alternative Idea inspired by exponential generating functions:

Each variable can be chosen any number of times, but the order in which they appear must be non-decreasing. So for each value a in 1..k, the contribution to the generating function is a sum over the number of times a is chosen, multiplied by some factors.

But I'm not sure.

Let’s try to model the DP state as follows:

We want to build the sequence step by step, where each step adds a new variable >= the previous ones.

At each step j, the last variable is a.

The DP[j][a] is the sum over all possible sequences ending with a of the product term up to j variables multiplied by the multinomial coefficient.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the multinomial coefficient can be handled by multiplying by 1/(c_a!), where c_a is the count of a in the sequence. For example, when adding a new variable a to a sequence that ends with a and has c_a instances of a, the multinomial coefficient is (j! / ( (c_a +1)! ) * product other counts! )). So the transition would involve dividing by (c_a +1) to account for the new a.

But tracking all possible counts is not feasible.

Alternative approach:

Since the multinomial coefficient is m! divided by the product of c_i! for all i, and the product of terms is product_{j=1}^m (k -a_j +1)^{j-1}, perhaps we can model the problem using exponential generating functions.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternative Idea:

Let’s consider that each time we add a new variable a >= the previous ones. For each such a, the contribution to the product is (k -a +1)^{current_length}, where current_length is the number of variables before adding this one. This is because when adding the j-th variable (j starts from 1), the product is multiplied by (k -a_j +1)^{j-1} (since there are j-1 variables before it, and each pair with this new variable contributes (k -a_j +1)).

The multinomial coefficient for the sequence is (m! ) / product (c_a! ), where m is the number of variables.

Thus, the problem can be modeled as follows:

The total sum is m! multiplied by the sum over all possible non-decreasing sequences of m variables (each between 1 and k) of the product of (k -a_j +1)^{j-1} / ( product_{a} c_a! ), where c_a is the count of a in the sequence.

But how to compute this sum.

Let’s think of generating functions. For each a in 1..k, and for each possible number of times a is used in the sequence, the contribution is:

sum_{t=1}^infinity [ x^t / t! ] * product_{j=1}^t (k -a +1)^{s_j} }, where s_j is the position of the j-th occurrence of a in the sequence.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, think of the problem as building the sequence in non-decreasing order, and for each new a added, the contribution is:

(k -a +1)^{current_length} * (1 / (t! )) 

where t is the number of times a has been used so far.

But I'm not sure.

Alternative Idea inspired by dynamic programming:

Let’s model the DP as follows. For each j (number of variables added so far), and for each possible current maximum a, we track the sum of the product terms multiplied by the inverse of the product of factorials of counts.

The transition would be: to add a new variable b >= a. The new product term is multiplied by (k -b +1)^j. The multinomial coefficient part is multiplied by 1/( (count_b + 1) ), where count_b is the number of times b has been used so far. But tracking count_b is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps if we consider that when adding a new variable b >= a, the new multinomial factor is (count_b + 1) / (j+1), but this is not clear.

Alternatively, the multinomial coefficient for a sequence of j variables ending with a maximum a is (j! ) / ( product_{v=1}^a c_v! ), where c_v is the count of v in the sequence. So when adding a new variable b >= a, the new count for b becomes c_b + 1, and the new multinomial coefficient is (j+1)! / ( product_{v=1}^b (c_v + delta_{v,b})! )).

This suggests that the DP state must track the counts of each variable, which is impractical for large k.

Given that the previous approaches are not feasible, perhaps we need to find a mathematical formula or a combinatorial identity that allows us to compute the required sum.

Alternative Idea: For each variable in the sequence, the contribution to the product is (k -a +1)^{t-1}, where t is the number of variables before it (including itself) that are <= a. 

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, notice that the product for a sorted sequence s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_m is:

prod_{j=1}^m (k -s_j +1)^{j-1}.

This product is the same for all permutations of this multiset. The multinomial coefficient for the multiset is m! / (prod c_v! ), where c_v is the count of each v.

Thus, the total contribution for a multiset with counts c_1, c_2, ..., c_k is:

prod_{v=1}^k [ (k -v +1)^{ sum_{t=1}^{c_v} (pos_v,t -1) } } ] * (m! / product c_v! )

where pos_v,t is the position of the t-th occurrence of v in the sorted sequence.

But this seems difficult to model.

Alternatively, consider that for each value v, the positions where it appears in the sorted sequence are consecutive. For example, suppose we have c_v copies of v. These copies will appear after all copies of values less than v and before all copies of values greater than v. So, the positions of the first occurrence of v is after all values less than v. For each occurrence of v, the position in the sorted sequence is determined by the sum of counts of values less than v plus the number of previous occurrences of v.

So, for example, if we have 2 occurrences of v=3, and there are 5 variables less than 3, then the two occurrences of 3 are in positions 6 and 7. The product term for these two occurrences is (k -3 +1)^{6-1} and (k-3 +1)^{7-1}.

The sum of the exponents for the two occurrences is 5 +6 = 11. 

But the sum of exponents for all occurrences of v is sum_{t=1 to c_v} ( (sum_{u <v} c_u ) + t -1 ), where sum_{u <v} c_u is the number of variables less than v.

This sum is c_v * (sum_{u <v} c_u ) + sum_{t=1 to c_v} (t-1) = c_v * S_v + c_v (c_v -1)/2, where S_v is the sum of counts of variables less than v.

The product term for v is (k -v +1) raised to this sum.

The total product for the multiset is the product over v of (k -v +1)^( c_v * S_v + c_v (c_v -1)/2 ).

The multinomial coefficient is m! / product c_v!.

Thus, the total contribution for a multiset is:

m! * product_{v=1}^k [ (k -v +1)^( c_v * S_v + c_v (c_v -1)/2 ) / ( c_v! ) ]

where S_v is the sum of counts of variables less than v.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming.

The key is to model the variables in order of increasing v. For each v, compute the contribution of adding c_v copies of v, given that the previous variables have sum S_v.

Let’s model this with a dynamic programming approach where we process the values v from 1 to k, and for each v, track the total sum of counts so far (which is S = sum_{u <v} c_u).

The state of the DP would be (v, S), where v is the current value being considered, and S is the total number of variables processed so far (i.e., the sum of counts for values less than v).

For each state (v, S), and for each possible count c of v (c >=0), we can transition to the next state (v+1, S + c), and compute the contribution for adding c copies of v.

The contribution for adding c copies of v is:

[ (k -v +1) ^ ( c * S + c(c-1)/2 ) ) / (c! ) ] 

And multiply this by the current DP state's value.

The initial state is (v=0, S=0) with value 1.

After processing all v up to k, the final answer is the sum of all states where the total count of variables is m = n-1, multiplied by m! (since the DP tracked the product divided by the multinomial coefficients' denominator, but the multinomial coefficient includes m! in the numerator).

Wait, the multinomial coefficient is m! / product c_v! So in the DP, for each state (v, S), and for each possible count c of v, the term is multiplied by [ (k -v +1) ^ ( c * S + c(c-1)/2 ) / (c! ) ], and the DP accumulates the product of such terms for all v. The final sum is the product over all v of these terms, multiplied by m!.

Thus, the DP approach would process each v in order, and track the possible S (sum of counts of previous variables) and the accumulated product.

The recurrence would be:

For each v from 1 to k:

   For each possible current S (sum of counts of variables less than v):

      For each possible count c of v (from 0 to m - S):

          new_S = S + c

          contribution = ( (k -v +1) ** ( c * S + c * (c-1) // 2 ) ) / ( factorial(c) )

          dp[v+1][new_S] += dp[v][S] * contribution

The initial state is dp[1][0] = 1 (processing v=1, sum S=0, and no variables processed yet).

After processing all v up to k, the answer is dp[k+1][m] * m!.

This seems feasible, as the maximum possible S is m (n-1 up to 250), and the number of v is up to 250. So the total number of states is k * (m + 1), which for k=250 and m=250 is manageable.

Thus, this is the approach we will take.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute factorials up to m (250) modulo 998244353, and their modular inverses.

2. Use dynamic programming where the state is (v, S), representing that we have processed values up to v-1, and have S variables so far.

3. For each state (v, S), iterate over possible counts c of value v (from 0 to m - S).

4. For each c, compute the contribution term: (k -v +1)^(c*S + c*(c-1)/2) / (c! ).

5. Multiply this term by the current DP value and add to the new state (v+1, S+c).

6. After processing all v, the answer is DP[k+1][m] multiplied by m! (mod 998244353).

But we need to handle exponents and divisions modulo 998244353.

But since 998244353 is a prime, we can precompute factorials and their inverses, and use modular exponentiation.

Let's formalize this:

- Precompute factorial[0...m], inv_fact[0...m], where factorial[c] = c! mod MOD, inv_fact[c] = (c!)^{-1} mod MOD.

- For each term (k -v +1) raised to the exponent (c*S + c*(c-1)/2), this can be computed using fast exponentiation.

- The division by c! is equivalent to multiplication by inv_fact[c].

Thus, the contribution term is:

pow(k -v +1, exponent) * inv_fact[c]

mod MOD.

Now, let's see how this works with the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:
3 2

n=3, so m = 2.

k=2.

We need to compute the sum for all possible multisets of 2 variables (each 1 or 2).

Possible multisets:

1,1: product is (k-1+1)^{0} * (k-1+1)^{1} = 2^0 * 2^1 = 2. The multinomial coefficient is 2!/(2!) = 1. Contribution is 2 * 1 = 2.

1,2: product is (k-1+1)^0 * (k-2+1)^{1} = 2^0 * 1^1 = 1. Multinomial coefficient is 2!/(1!1!) = 2. Contribution is 1 * 2 = 2.

2,2: product is (k-2+1)^{0} * (k-2+1)^{1} = 1^0 * 1^1 = 1. Multinomial coefficient is 2!/(2!) =1. Contribution is 1*1=1.

So total sum is 2+2+1 =5. Multiply by m! =2! =2, but wait no. Wait, according to the DP approach, after processing all v, the sum is dp[k+1][m] multiplied by m!.

Wait, no. The DP computes the sum of (product terms) / (product c_v! ), and then multiplies by m! to get the multinomial coefficient.

In the sample, the DP would compute for each multiset:

For {1,1}:

product term is 2^{0 +1} =2^1 =2. Then divide by 2! (c_1=2) → 2/2! = 1. This term is added to the DP.

For {1,2}:

product term is 2^0 * 1^1 =1 → divide by (1! *1! ) →1/(1*1) =1. Term is 1.

For {2,2}:

product term is 1^{0} *1^{1} =1 → divide by 2! → 1/2. So term is 0.5 when added.

So the DP sum is 1 + 1 +0.5 = 2.5. Multiply by m! =2! =2 → 5.

Which matches the sample output.

Thus, the approach works.

Now, the code:

We need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to m=250.

Implement the DP as a 2D array, where for each v (from 1 to k), and S (sum of counts up to v-1), track the current value.

Initialize dp[0][0] =1.

For each v in 1..k:

   for each possible S in 0..m:

       if dp[v-1][S] is zero, skip.

       for c in 0 to (m - S):

           exponent = c * S + c*(c-1) //2

           term = pow(k -v +1, exponent, MOD) 

           term = term * inv_fact[c] % MOD

           new_S = S + c

           dp[v][new_S] = (dp[v][new_S] + dp[v-1][S] * term) % MOD

At the end, the answer is dp[k][m] * factorial[m] % MOD.

But wait, no. The DP starts with v=1, and for each v up to k. So after processing v=k, new_S can be up to m. So the final state is after processing v=k, and S = m. 

Wait, the DP steps would process v from 1 to k, and for each v, compute transitions. After processing v=k, the DP for v=k+1 will have S up to m.

So in code, the DP array can be represented as a 2D array where the first dimension is v (from 0 to k+1), and the second is S.

But in practice, we can use two arrays: previous and current.

But in Python, for efficiency, we can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries or 2D lists.

But for n up to 250, and k up to 250, a 2D list with dimensions (k+1) x (m+1) is feasible, where m =n-1.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read n and k.

m = n-1

MOD = 998244353

Precompute factorial up to m, inv_fact up to m.

Initialize a 2D DP array with dimensions (k+2) x (m+1), initialized to 0.

dp[0][0] =1.

For v in 1 to k:

   for s in 0 to m:

       if dp[v-1][s] ==0:

           continue

       for c in 0 to (m -s):

           exponent = c * s + c*(c-1)//2

           # Compute (k -v +1) is the current value's contribution. If v exceeds k, then k-v+1 is negative, but v ranges up to k.

           base = k -v +1

           if base <0:

               term =0

           else:

               term = pow(base, exponent, MOD)

           term = term * inv_fact[c] % MOD

           new_s = s + c

           if new_s >m:

               continue

           dp[v][new_s] = (dp[v][new_s] + dp[v-1][s] * term) % MOD

Finally, the answer is (dp[k][m] * factorial[m]) % MOD.

But in Python, the 2D array for DP can be represented as two 1D arrays, previous and current, to save space.

So, let's implement this using two 1D arrays.

Initialize previous as [0]*(m+1), previous[0] =1.

For each v from 1 to k:

   current = [0]*(m+1)

   for s in 0 to m:

       if previous[s] ==0:

           continue

       for c in 0 to (m -s):

           exponent = c * s + c*(c-1)//2

           base = k -v +1

           if base <0:

               term =0

           else:

               term = pow(base, exponent, MOD)

           term = term * inv_fact[c] % MOD

           new_s = s + c

           if new_s >m:

               continue

           current[new_s] = (current[new_s] + previous[s] * term) % MOD

   previous = current

After processing all v, the result is previous[m] * factorial[m] % MOD.

Now, for cases where k < v, but since v loops up to k, this is not possible. So base = k -v +1 can be zero or positive.

But for example, v =k, base is 1. v =k+1 is not processed.

This should handle all cases.

Now, let's test the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

3 2 → m=2, k=2.

Precompute factorials up to 2: [1,1,2]. inv_fact = [1,1, 499122177] (since 2^{-1} mod MOD is 499122177).

Processing v=1:

base = 2-1+1 =2.

For s=0:

c can be 0,1,2.

For c=0:

exponent =0 → 2^0 =1. term =1 * inv_fact[0]=1 → term=1. new_s=0. current[0] += 1*1=1.

For c=1:

exponent =1*0 +0 =0 → 2^0 =1. term=1 * inv_fact[1] (1) → term=1. new_s=1. current[1] += 1*1=1.

For c=2:

exponent=2*0 +1=1 → 2^1 =2. term=2 * inv_fact[2] (2 * 499122177 mod MOD → 2*499122177=998244354 → mod 998244353 is 1). So term=1. new_s=2. current[2] +=1*1=1.

So after v=1, previous is [1,1,1].

Processing v=2:

base =2-2+1=1.

For s in 0,1,2:

For s=0:

possible c=0,1,2.

But new_s =0+ c ≤2.

For c=0:

exponent=0 → term=1 * inv_fact[0] =1. new_s=0 → current[0] += previous[0] *1 →1*1=1.

For c=1:

exponent=1*0 +0 =0 →1^0=1. term=1 * inv_fact[1] =1. new_s=1 → current[1] +=1*1=1.

For c=2:

exponent=2*0 +1=1 →1^1=1. term=1 * inv_fact[2] = 1 * 499122177 →499122177. new_s=2 → current[2] +=1 *499122177 =499122177.

For s=1:

c can be 0,1 (s+c <=2 →1+1=2).

c=0:

exponent=0 → term=1. new_s=1 → current[1] += previous[1] *1 =1*1=1 → current[1] becomes 1+1=2.

c=1:

exponent=1*1 +0=1 →1^1=1. term=1 * inv_fact[1] =1. new_s=2 → current[2] += previous[1]*1=1 → current[2] =499122177 +1=499122178.

For s=2:

c can be 0.

term=1 *1 =1. new_s=2 → current[2] += previous[2] *1 =1 → current[2] becomes 499122178 +1 =499122179.

So after v=2, previous[m=2] is 499122179.

Multiply by factorial[2] =2 →499122179 *2 mod MOD is 998244358 mod MOD →5.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the code in Python:

We need to precompute factorial and inv_factorial up to m=250.

Then, iterate v from 1 to k, and update the DP.

Implementing this:

Read n and k.

m =n-1.

MOD=998244353.

Precompute factorial and inv_fact:

fact = [1]*(m+1)

for i in 1 to m:

   fact[i] = fact[i-1] *i % MOD

inv_fact = [1]*(m+1)

inv_fact[m] = pow(fact[m], MOD-2, MOD)

for i in m-1 downto 0:

   inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

Then, initialize previous = [0]*(m+1)

previous[0] =1.

for v in 1 to k:

   current = [0]*(m+1)

   for s in 0 to m:

       if previous[s] ==0:

           continue

       max_c = m - s

       for c in 0 to max_c:

           exponent = c*s + c*(c-1)//2

           base = k -v +1

           if base <0:

               term =0

           else:

               term = pow(base, exponent, MOD)

           term = term * inv_fact[c] % MOD

           new_s = s +c

           if new_s >m:

               continue

           current[new_s] = (current[new_s] + previous[s] * term) % MOD

   previous = current.copy()

After processing all v, answer is (previous[m] * fact[m]) % MOD.

Testing against sample input 1.

    inv_fact = [1] * (m + 1)
    inv_fact[m] = pow(fact[m], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

    print(answer, file=output_stream)

Now, implement this in Python.

Edge Cases:

If n=2 (m=1), and k=1. Then, the only possible graph is a single edge between 1 and 2 with weight 1. The sum of edges incident to 1 is 1. The MST is that edge, sum is 1. So the answer is 1.
