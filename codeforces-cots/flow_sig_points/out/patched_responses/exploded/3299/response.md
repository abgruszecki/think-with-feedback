<think>
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about pairing candy boxes such that the sum of each pair is divisible by k. We need to find the maximum number of boxes that can be used in these pairs. Each box can be in at most one pair.

First, I need to think about how the remainders work. For two numbers a and b, their sum is divisible by k if (a % k + b % k) % k == 0. So, the remainders of each pair should add up to k or 0 (since 0 mod k is 0). Wait, actually, the sum mod k should be 0. So, if a mod k is r, then b mod k must be (k - r) mod k. Because (r + (k - r)) mod k is 0. But there's a special case when r is 0, in which case the other number must also have a remainder of 0.

So the approach is probably to count the frequency of each remainder mod k. Then, pair the remainders accordingly.

Let me think. Let's create a frequency array or dictionary that counts how many boxes have each remainder when divided by k. For each remainder r, the number of possible pairs would be determined by the counts of r and (k - r) mod k. But we have to be careful not to count pairs twice. For example, when r and (k - r) are different, like r=1 and k=3, then (k - r) is 2. So pairs between remainder 1 and 2. But once we process r=1, we don't want to process r=2 again. So maybe we can iterate from r=1 to r = k//2 - 1, and then handle the middle case (if k is even) and the remainder 0 case separately.

The steps I'm thinking are:

1. Compute the remainder counts for each possible remainder (0 to k-1).

2. For each remainder r in 1 to (k-1)/2, pair the counts of r and (k - r). The number of pairs possible is the minimum of the two counts. Multiply by 2 since each pair contributes two boxes.

Wait, but no. Wait, each pair is two boxes. So for each pair formed between r and k-r, each pair is two boxes. So for example, if there are 3 boxes with remainder 1 and 4 boxes with remainder 2 (k=3), then the maximum possible pairs is 3 (since 3 is the minimum of 3 and 4), and each pair contributes 2 boxes, so 3*2=6 boxes.

But when r and k-r are the same (like when k is even and r is k/2), then each pair is two boxes from the same remainder. So the count for such r is the floor(count[r] / 2) * 2. For example, if r is 2 and k=4, then two boxes with remainder 2 can form a pair. So count[r] is 5, then floor(5/2) is 2 pairs, contributing 4 boxes.

Similarly, for remainder 0, we can pair any two boxes. So the number of pairs is floor(count[0]/2) * 2.

So putting this all together:

- The total pairs for remainder 0 is (count[0] // 2) * 2.

- For each r from 1 to (k-1)//2:

   add min(count[r], count[k - r]) * 2.

- If k is even, then handle r = k/2 as a separate case: add (count[r] // 2) * 2.

Wait, but how?

Wait, for example, when k is 4, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3. Then, for r=1, we pair with 3. For r=2, since k-r is 2, that's the same as r. So we have to count pairs within the same remainder here. So for r in 1 to (k-1)/2, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is:

Loop for r from 1 to k//2:

   if r != k - r:

       take min(count[r], count[k-r]) and add that multiplied by 2.

   else:

       take count[r] // 2, multiply by 2.

But when r is 0, it's a separate case.

Wait, maybe the code should be structured as:

count_remainders is a list where count_remainders[r] is the number of elements with remainder r.

result = 0

for r in 1 to k//2:

   if r != k - r:

       pairs = min(count_remainders[r], count_remainders[k - r])

       result += pairs * 2

   else:

       pairs = count_remainders[r] // 2

       result += pairs * 2

Then, handle the remainder 0:

result += (count_remainders[0] // 2) * 2

But wait, for k=2, when r=1, then k - r is 1. So the code would check if r == k - r (1 == 1), and then do count[r]//2 *2.

Yes. That's correct.

So this approach would cover all possible pairs except for remainder 0.

But how to handle cases where k is even? For example, k=4, and r=2. Then, r is exactly k/2. So for each pair of elements with remainder 2, their sum is 4, which is divisible by 4. So those can be paired. So the code would handle that.

So this approach seems correct.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the remainder for each d_i mod k.

2. Count how many elements are there for each remainder (0 to k-1).

3. For each remainder r in 1 to k//2:

   a. If r is not equal to k - r:

       Take the minimum of count[r] and count[k - r], multiply by 2 (since each pair contributes two boxes).

       Add this to the total.

   b. If r is equal to k - r (i.e., when k is even and r is k/2):

       Take count[r] divided by 2, multiplied by 2 (since each pair has two boxes). So this is (count[r] // 2) * 2.

       Add this to the total.

4. For remainder 0:

   Take count[0] divided by 2, multiplied by 2.

   Add to the total.

Wait, but (count[r] // 2) * 2 is the same as (count[r] // 2) * 2, which equals count[r] if even, or count[r] -1 if odd. So for example, 5 //2 is 2, 2*2=4. So the code adds 4 boxes.

But when r and k-r are different, min(count[r], count[k-r]) *2.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose r=1 and k=3. So pairs are between 1 and 2. If there are 3 elements with remainder 1 and 4 elements with remainder 2. Then min(3,4) is 3. So 3 pairs, each contributing two boxes. So 3*2=6 boxes. Which is correct.

In the code, this would be added to the result. That's right.

So the code structure would be:

Initialize a list of counts for each remainder.

Compute the sum as follows:

sum_boxes = 0

sum_boxes += (count[0] // 2) * 2

for r in 1 to k//2:

    complement = k - r

    if r < complement:

        # in this case, when r is less than complement, we process the pair once.

        # but wait, when r is 1 and k=5, complement is 4. So when r is 1, we process 1 and 4.

        # but when r is 4, which is in the loop for k//2 = 2. So the loop would run from 1 to 2.

        # Wait, when k is 5, k//2 is 2 (since 5//2 is 2). So the loop runs from r=1 to 2.

        # For r=1, complement is 4. So 1 and 4 are processed here.

        # For r=2, complement is 3. So 2 and 3 are processed here.

        # So all possible pairs are covered.

        # So in the code, when r is from 1 to k//2, and for each r, we pair with (k - r).

        # So in this case, when r is 1 and complement is 4, the code will add min(count[1], count[4])*2.

        # Then, when r is 2, complement is 3. So add min(count[2], count[3]) *2.

        # So all possible pairs between r and complement are covered.

    if r == complement:

        sum_boxes += (count[r] // 2) * 2

    else:

        sum_boxes += min(count[r], count[complement]) * 2

Wait, but the loop is from r=1 to k//2. So in the case where k is even, like 4, the loop runs up to r=2 (since 4//2 is 2). For r=2, complement is 2, so it's handled as the same case. So in that case, we add (count[2] //2 ) *2.

Yes.

So the code would correctly handle all pairs.

So the plan is:

- Compute the remainder counts.

- For each r from 1 to k//2:

   if r != k - r: sum += min(count[r], count[k - r]) * 2

   else: sum += (count[r] // 2) * 2

- Also, sum += (count[0] //2) * 2.

But wait, the code in the loop is:

for r in 1 to k//2:

   complement = k - r

   if r == complement:

       sum += ... 

   else:

       sum += ... 

But when k is even, the loop includes r = k//2. For example, k=4, then r can be 1 and 2. For r=2, complement is 2. So handled in the same case.

But when r is in 1 to k//2, the complement (k - r) can be >= r. For example, when r=1 and k=5, complement is 4, which is larger than r. So in the code, for r=1, we pair with 4, which hasn't been processed yet. But in the loop, when r=4, it's not part of the loop (since k//2 is 2). So the code would process each pair once.

Wait, but in the loop from 1 to k//2, r ranges from 1 to floor(k/2). For example, when k is 5, the loop runs for r=1 and 2. For r=1, complement is 4. For r=2, complement is 3. So when the loop runs for r=1, it's pairing 1 and 4, and when r=2, it's pairing 2 and 3. Then, the code would add the min of each pair. So for k=5, all possible pairs are handled.

But when k is even, like 4, then r can be 1 and 2. For r=1, complement is 3. So pair 1 and 3. For r=2, complement is 2, so handle the same case.

So the code is correct.

So the steps are:

1. Count all remainders.

2. Process remainder 0: count[0] // 2 * 2.

3. For each r in 1 to k//2:

   complement = k - r

   if r < complement:

       add min(count[r], count[complement]) *2

   elif r == complement:

       add (count[r] //2) *2

   else:

       do nothing (since when r > complement, that pair has already been processed when r was complement?)

Wait, no. Because in the loop, for example, when k=5 and r=1, complement is 4, which is larger than r. So in the code, when r=1, we process 1 and 4. But when r=4 in a higher loop, but r=4 is not part of the loop because the loop runs up to k//2=2. So the code correctly processes each pair once.

So the code for the loop is:

for r in 1 to (k//2):

   complement = k - r

   if r == complement:

       # even k, r is k/2

       sum += (count[r] // 2) *2

   else:

       sum += min(count[r], count[complement]) *2

Wait, but this is not correct. Because for example, when k=5, and r=1, complement is 4. Then, when r=1, the code adds min(count[1], count[4])*2. But for r=4, which is not in the loop (since k//2 is 2), it's not processed again. So the code handles each pair once.

But in the loop, when r runs from 1 to k//2 (inclusive), and for each r, we process the pair (r, complement), then for any pair (a, b) where a < b and a + b =k, this pair is processed once when r is a, and complement is b. So the code correctly adds the min of the two counts multiplied by 2.

But when a is in 1 to k//2, and b is in (k//2+1) to k-1, then a is processed once. So this should handle all possible pairs.

So the code is correct.

So the approach is to compute the counts, then for each pair of remainders (r, k-r), add the possible pairs.

Now, the edge cases:

Test case 1:

n=7, k=2

d is [1,2,2,3,2,4,10]

Compute remainders mod 2:

1 mod 2 is 1

2 mod 2 is 0

2 mod 2 is 0

3 mod 2 is 1

2 mod 2 is 0

4 mod 2 is 0

10 mod 2 is 0.

So counts for 0: 5 (elements 2,2,2,4,10), counts for 1: 2 (elements 1,3).

Processing remainder 0: 5//2 = 2 pairs, contributing 4 boxes.

Then for r=1 (since k//2 is 1):

complement is 2-1=1. So r equals complement. So count[1] is 2. 2//2=1 pair, contributing 2 boxes.

Total sum is 4+2 =6, which matches the example.

Yes.

Another example: the third input.

n=7, k=3.

d = [1,2,2,3,2,4,5]

Remainders mod 3:

1 mod 3 →1

2 →2

2 →2

3 →0

2 →2

4 →1

5 mod3 →2.

So counts:

0:1 (3)

1:2 (1,4)

2:4 (2,2,2,5)

Processing remainder 0: 1//2 →0, so 0 boxes.

Loop runs for r=1 (since k//2 is 1).

complement is 3-1=2. So r is 1, complement 2.

min(2,4) →2. Multiply by 2 →4 boxes. So sum becomes 4.

But what about the remainders 2? Because when r=1, the code adds min(2,4)*2=4. Then, in the loop, since k//2 is 1, the code doesn't process r=2. So the code is correct.

But wait, the counts for 2 is 4, but after pairing with 1's (count[1] is 2), then the remaining 2's can pair among themselves.

Wait, but according to the code, since r=1 and complement is 2 (k=3), the code adds 2 pairs (min(2,4)=2). So 2*2=4 boxes. So the 2's remaining count is 4-2=2.

But those 2's can be paired among themselves. But according to the code, since r=2 is not part of the loop (as k//2 is 1), how are they handled?

Ah, here's a problem. Because in this example, the code's loop would only process r=1 (since k=3, k//2 is 1). For r=1, complement is 2. So code adds min(2,4)*2=4. So sum is 4. Then, the remaining 2's are 4-2=2. But those can be paired among themselves. But the code doesn't handle this.

So the code would output 4 boxes (from 1 and 2 pairings) and 0 from remainder 0. So total 4. Which matches the sample.

Wait, but in the third example, the correct output is 4. So code works.

But what's happening here? The code adds 4 boxes from the pairs between remainder 1 and 2, but leaves 2 boxes with remainder 2. But the code's approach would not pair those.

Wait, in the third example, after pairing 2 elements from remainder 1 and 2 elements from remainder 2, the remainder 2 has 4-2=2 left. Then, those can be paired into one more pair (2 boxes). So total 4 + 2=6? But the sample output is 4. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, let's re-examine the third example:

Sample input 3:

7 3

1 2 2 3 2 4 5 →remainders mod3:

1: 1 mod3 →1

2: 2 mod3 →2

2 →2

3 →0

2 →2

4 →1 mod3 (4-3=1)

5 →5 mod3 →2.

So the counts:

0 →1

1 →2 (elements 1 and 4)

2 →4 (elements 2,2,2,5).

The code's approach:

Processing remainder 0: 1//2=0, so 0 boxes.

Loop runs for r=1 (since k//2=1).

complement=3-1=2.

min(2,4)=2. So adds 2*2=4 boxes.

So the sum is 4.

But the remaining 4-2=2 elements in remainder 2. They can form one pair (2 boxes). So total sum would be 4+2=6, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, this suggests that the code is wrong. But in the sample output, the answer is 4. So why?

Because in the third example, the code's approach would output 4, but according to the sample, the correct answer is 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, the sample input is:

In the third example, the answer is 4. The possible pairs are (1,2) →1+2=3, divisible by3. And (6,7) →4 and5, sum 9. So two pairs →4 boxes.

So why isn't the code accounting for the remaining two elements with remainder 2?

Ah, because in the code's approach, when r=2 is not processed. Because the loop runs from 1 to k//2=1. So r=2 is not in the loop. Therefore, the code doesn't process the pairs between remainder 2 and remainder 2. Because for k=3, the code's loop runs only for r=1, and in that case, the code pairs r=1 with r=2. After that, the remaining 2 elements in remainder 2 can form a pair (sum 2+2=4, which mod3 is 1. Not divisible by3). Wait, wait. Oh right! Because two elements with remainder 2, their sum is 2+2=4, mod3 is 1. So not divisible by3. So they can't form a pair. So in the third example, after pairing 2 elements of remainder1 and 2 elements of remainder2, the remaining 2 elements in remainder2 can't form any pair. So the code's approach is correct.

So why?

Because the sum of two elements with remainder r is 2r modk. For this sum to be divisible byk, 2r modk must be 0. So in the third example, r=2, k=3. 2*2=4 mod3=1, which is not zero. So those two elements can't form a pair. Therefore, the code correctly doesn't count them.

Ah! So the code's approach of only processing pairs between r and (k-r) is correct. Because only pairs between r and (k-r) can sum to a multiple ofk. So in the code, when r is 2 and k is3, (k-r) is1. So the code pairs with 1. But once the 1's are exhausted, the remaining 2's can't form any pairs. So the code's approach is correct.

So the code's approach is correct.

Therefore, the code is as follows:

Read n and k.

Read the list of d_i.

Compute the remainder counts.

Process as described.

Now, for the code:

We can use a list of size k to store counts.

Then, compute the sum.

In Python, for n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.

But when k is 1, then all elements must have remainder 0. So pairs are count[0]//2 *2.

But the code would handle it.

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    d = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    counts = [0] * k
    for num in d:
        rem = num % k
        counts[rem] +=1

    total = (counts[0] //2) *2

    for r in range(1, (k//2)+1):
        comp = k - r
        if r == comp:
            # same remainder
            total += (counts[r] //2)*2
        else:
            total += min(counts[r], counts[comp]) *2

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
7 3
1 2 2 3 2 4 5
""",
            "output": \
"""\
4
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Another sample:

Third example:

counts[0] is1 → 0 pairs. So total starts at0.

Loop runs r=1:

comp is 3-1=2. So counts[1] is2, counts[2] is4. min(2,4)=2. 2*2=4. So total is4. Which matches the sample.

Yes.

So the code is correct.

Now, considering edge cases.

Edge case where k=1:

n=3, k=1.

All remainders are0. counts[0] is3. So (3//2)*2 → 2 boxes. So output is2.

Another case: k=2, all elements are 1. So remainder1. Then:

counts[0] =0.

Loop for r=1:

comp is1. So counts[1] is n. So (n//2)*2. For example, n=5 → (5//2)*2=4. So output4.

Yes.

So the code works.

So this should be the correct approach.
</think>

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
d = list(map(int, input().split()))
counts = [0] * k
for num in d:
    counts[num % k] += 1

total = (counts[0] // 2) * 2

for r in range(1, (k // 2) + 1):
    comp = k - r
    if r == comp:
        total += (counts[r] // 2) * 2
    else:
        total += min(counts[r], counts[comp]) * 2

print(total)
```
