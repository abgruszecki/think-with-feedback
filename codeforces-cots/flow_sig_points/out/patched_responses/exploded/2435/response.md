Okay, let's see. The problem is to replace all the question marks in the string with the first k lowercase letters such that the minimum of the maximum consecutive lengths for each letter is as large as possible. Hmm. So we need to maximize the minimum of these f_i values. 

So the key here is to find the maximum possible value x such that for each of the k letters, there exists a way to replace the question marks so that the maximum run of that letter is at least x. But since we need the minimum of all these to be as large as possible, we need all letters to have at least x, and find the maximum x where this is possible.

Wait, but how do we approach this? Maybe binary search on x. Because for each candidate x, we need to check if it's possible to assign the question marks such that every letter's maximum run is at least x, but wait no. Wait, the actual problem is that after replacing the question marks, each letter's maximum run f_i is computed, and the value is the minimum of all f_i. We need to maximize that minimum. So the optimal x is the maximum possible such that all letters have f_i >= x. Wait, no. Because maybe some letters have higher f_i than x, but the minimum of them is x. So the maximum possible x is the largest x where there exists a way to replace the question marks such that every letter's f_i is at least x. Because then the minimum would be x. If x is the largest possible, that's our answer.

So binary search on x. For each x, check if it's possible to replace the question marks such that all letters have a run of at least x. If yes, then we can try higher x. If no, try lower.

But wait, how to check that for a given x, all letters can have a maximum run of at least x? Because even if each letter has at least one run of x, but their f_i could be higher. The check is that for each letter, after replacement, the maximum run is >= x. So the minimum of those maximums is >= x. Wait, but the problem's value is the minimum of all f_i. So for our binary search, we need to find the largest x where there's a replacement such that for every letter, its f_i (max run) is >= x. Because then the minimum would be x. So the answer is x.

So the approach is:

1. Binary search on x, from 0 up to n (since the maximum possible run is n).

2. For each x, check if it's possible to replace the question marks such that every letter's maximum run is >= x.

If we can find the maximum x where this condition holds, that's the answer.

But how do we check this condition efficiently?

Wait, the condition is that for each of the k letters, the maximum run in the modified string is at least x. So the modified string must have, for each letter, at least one run of length x or more.

But how do we model this? Because the letters are interdependent. For example, to have a run for letter 'a' of x, you might have to set some question marks to 'a', but those same positions can't be used for other letters. But how can we model the assignments such that all letters have their required runs?

This seems complicated. Let's think of each letter's constraints. For each letter c in 1..k, the string must have at least one run of length x where all characters are c (possibly after replacing question marks). So for each c, there exists at least one interval of length x where all characters in that interval can be set to c (i.e., each character in the interval is either c or a question mark). And then, after replacing the question marks in these intervals for each c, the entire string's question marks must be filled in a way that satisfies all these intervals.

Wait, but this seems tricky. Because the intervals for different letters might overlap. For example, a question mark in the string might need to be part of a run for multiple letters. Which isn't possible. So how can we find for a given x whether there exists a way to assign the question marks such that every letter c has at least one run of x consecutive c's (possibly after replacements)?

Alternatively, perhaps for each x, the problem reduces to ensuring that for each letter, there exists at least one possible interval of length x that can be turned into a run of that letter. And then, that all these intervals can be covered by the question marks in a way that they don't require conflicting assignments. Wait, but that's not necessarily sufficient. For example, maybe each letter has a possible interval, but the intervals overlap and require a question mark in the overlap to be assigned to multiple letters, which is impossible.

So this approach might not work. Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Wait, the binary search approach requires that for a given x, we can check if there's a way to assign the question marks such that for every letter, the maximum run of that letter is >= x. But how to model that check?

Alternative approach: For a given x, to ensure that for every letter, there exists a run of at least x in the modified string. So, for each letter c, there must be at least one position in the original string where a consecutive x-length substring can be turned into all c's by replacing the question marks. Then, the problem is to select for each c such a window, and ensure that the assignments of the question marks in the union of all these windows are compatible. However, even this is not sufficient, because other parts of the string might affect the maximum run for c. For example, even if a window is assigned to c, but elsewhere in the string there's a longer run of c's, but the maximum run is that longer one. But the problem's condition is that the maximum run is at least x, so as long as there's at least one run of x, the rest can be longer or not. So perhaps the check is to find for each c at least one possible x-length window that can be made all c's, and then ensure that all these windows can be assigned in a way that the overlaps are handled properly.

But even this approach is tricky. Let's think: For each c, we need to choose a window (a consecutive x-length substring) that can be turned into all c's. The other characters in the string can be filled with any of the k letters, as long as their maximum runs are >=x. Wait, but perhaps this is not possible. For example, after choosing these windows for each c, the other question marks could be filled in a way that creates longer runs for some letters, but other letters might not have any runs longer than their chosen window. But in any case, the check is that each c has at least one run of x. So even if other runs are longer, that's okay.

So the problem reduces to: For each c, select a window of x length that can be turned into all c's (i.e., all characters in the window are c or ?), and then the rest of the question marks can be filled in any way. But even this is not correct, because once we have these windows, the rest of the question marks can be filled with letters that might create longer runs. But the check is only that each c has at least x. So perhaps the presence of such a window for each c is sufficient. Because even if the rest of the string is filled with other letters, but each c has at least one x-length window, then their f_i is at least x. So the check for x is possible if and only if for each c, there exists at least one x-length window in the original string that can be turned into all c's (i.e., all characters in the window are either c or ?). Because then, when we replace the question marks in those windows with c's, and the other question marks with any letters (like c's again to make longer runs), then each c's maximum run will be at least x.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose there's a window for c of x, but in the modified string, that window is part of a longer run. For example, if the window is surrounded by c's or question marks that are turned into c's, then the maximum run could be longer. But in any case, the presence of that window (now turned into all c's) ensures that the maximum run is at least x. So for the binary check, the necessary and sufficient condition is that for each c, there exists at least one x-length window in the original string that can be made all c's (i.e., the characters in the window are either c or ?). Because if that's true, then replacing the question marks in those windows with c's, and the rest with any letters (maybe all c's) would result in each c having at least x. 

But wait, what if the problem is that when you select these windows, the overlapping regions require conflicting assignments? For example, a question mark in two different windows for different letters. Then you can't set it to both letters. So this approach would not work. So the problem is, if for each c, there's a window of x that can be turned into c, but those windows for different c's overlap. Then, when you try to assign those overlapping positions to different c's, you can't, so the approach fails.

So this suggests that the initial idea is incorrect, because overlapping windows for different c's would make the problem impossible. Therefore, the check for x is not simply that each c has a possible window, but that the union of these windows can be assigned in a way that the overlapping parts are handled correctly.

So how can we model this? This seems like a problem where for each x, we need to select one window per c (of x length) such that the selected windows can be "colored" with their respective c's, and all overlapping parts in the original string can be resolved. However, this is a combinatorial problem that's probably NP-hard, given that k can be up to 17, which suggests a bitmask approach, but 17 is manageable with some bitmask DP.

Hmm. Let's think again. For the binary search step, given x, how to check whether there's a way to replace the question marks such that every c in 1..k has a run of x consecutive c's. 

The key idea here is that for each c, there must be a window of x consecutive positions that can be turned into c's (by replacing any question marks in the window with c). Additionally, these windows must be assigned in such a way that for any position in multiple windows, the chosen c's don't conflict. For example, a position in two different windows (for different c's) must be assigned to both, which is impossible. So the problem reduces to selecting, for each c, a window that can be turned into c's, and all these windows are pairwise non-overlapping. But that's not necessary. Wait, no. For example, a position could be part of two windows for different c's. However, in that case, the question marks in that position would have to be replaced with both c's, which is impossible. So, the problem is that overlapping windows for different c's would require the same position to be replaced with multiple different letters, which is impossible. Therefore, the windows selected for each c must not overlap, but how?

But that's not feasible. For example, if two c's have windows that don't overlap, but the rest of the string could have overlapping assignments. But how can we model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the selected windows for each c, the question marks in those windows must be replaced with c, and the rest can be filled with any letters, but overlapping windows would require conflicting assignments. So the solution is to choose, for each c, a window that can be turned into c's (i.e., all characters in the window are either c or ?), and these windows for different c's must not overlap. Then, the rest of the question marks can be filled in any way. Because this way, the overlapping is avoided, and each c has its window. Then, the maximum run for each c would be at least x. 

But this approach would require selecting non-overlapping windows for all c's, each of length x. However, this is very restrictive and may not be possible even if x is small. For example, if k is 17 and x is 1, then we need 17 non-overlapping windows of length 1, which may not be possible if the string is short.

But this is not correct. Let's take the first example. The input is a??ab????b, and k=2. The answer is 4. The solution is to have 'aaaa' for a and 'bbbb' for b. The windows for a and b could be overlapping. Wait, but in that case, how are the overlapping question marks handled? For example, in the first example, the replacement could be aaaaabbbbb, but the windows for a and b are adjacent. But in that case, the overlapping between the windows is not a problem. Wait, perhaps the approach of selecting non-overlapping windows is not necessary.

Wait, the problem is that when you select a window for c, you have to set all question marks in that window to c. But if another window for c' overlaps, then the overlapping positions must be set to both c and c', which is impossible. So the only way to have multiple windows for different c's is to select windows that do not overlap. Otherwise, overlapping positions cannot be assigned to multiple letters. Therefore, the correct approach is to select for each c a window of x length that can be turned into c (i.e., all characters in the window are c or ?), and these windows must not overlap. Then, in the modified string, each c has a run of x, and the rest of the question marks can be filled in any way (but preferably to not create conflicting assignments). But this is a very restrictive condition. For example, the first example would require two non-overlapping windows of length 4 for a and b. But in the example, the solution uses overlapping windows. Hmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong.

Wait, in the first example, after replacement, the a's have a run of 4, and the b's have a run of 6. The overlapping between their windows would require the same positions to be a and b. But that's impossible. Therefore, the actual solution must have non-overlapping windows. Let me re-examine the first example's input.

Original input: a??ab????b. After replacement, one possible output is aaaaabbbbb. So for a, the first four characters are a's. For b, the last six are b's. The window for a is positions 0-3 (0-based?), which is 'a??a' in the original. The window for b is positions 5-9, which are '????b' in the original (but after replacement, they're all b's except the last character, which is b). So the windows for a and b are non-overlapping. So in that case, the approach of selecting non-overlapping windows works. So the solution for the first example is possible because the windows for a and b are non-overlapping.

Another possible solution in the first example is aaaaababbbb, where the a's are in positions 0-3 (window of 4), and the b's have a window somewhere else. So perhaps the check for x is: can we select a window for each c of length x, non-overlapping with the other windows, such that each window is valid (can be turned into c's) and the original string allows that.

But how to model this check?

So for a given x, we need to select a subset of intervals (one per c) of length x, such that all are non-overlapping, each interval is valid for its c (all characters are c or ?), and the intervals cover all k letters. Then, the rest of the question marks can be filled in any way. Because as long as each c has a window of x, their maximum run is at least x, so the minimum of the maximums is at least x.

So the check is whether there exists a way to select such intervals. So the problem reduces to, for x, can we select k intervals (each of length x) such that:

1. Each interval is valid for its c (all characters in the interval are c or ?).

2. The intervals are pairwise non-overlapping.

If this is possible, then x is a candidate, and we can try higher x. Otherwise, try lower.

This seems manageable. Because with k up to 17, and n up to 2e5, how do we model this?

But with k=17, and for each c, we need to choose a valid interval, and ensure that they don't overlap. This is a problem of matching intervals for each c, but how?

The problem is similar to interval scheduling. We need to choose one interval for each of the k letters, such that none of them overlap.

But how to model this? For each x, first precompute for each c all possible intervals of length x that are valid (all characters in the interval are c or ?). Then, the problem is to select one interval per c, such that none of them overlap. This is equivalent to checking if the intervals can be selected in a way that forms a set of non-overlapping intervals covering all k letters.

But with k up to 17, and n up to 2e5, this could be done with some bitmask DP or backtracking. However, for each x, the number of intervals per c could be up to O(n) for each c. So for k=17, this is challenging.

But considering that for each c, the valid intervals can be represented as a list, and we need to select one from each list such that the intervals are non-overlapping. This is similar to the problem of scheduling jobs with constraints. But this is NP-hard for general k. However, since k is up to 17, which is manageable with dynamic programming, perhaps using a bitmask approach where the state represents which letters have been processed and the last interval's end.

Alternatively, another approach is to model this as a bipartite graph. But with k=17, perhaps some backtracking with memoization could work. But given that n is 2e5 and the intervals per c could be O(n), even this may be impossible.

So, given the time constraints (3 seconds per test case), perhaps we can find a way to model this problem with a bitmask-based approach.

Let me outline the steps again:

For a given x, check if there exists a way to choose for each c in 1..k a valid interval of length x (i.e., the interval's characters are all c or ?), and all chosen intervals are non-overlapping.

So for each x, the steps are:

1. Precompute for each c, all possible intervals of length x that can be turned into c's. For each c, collect all the possible [start, end] positions where the interval is valid.

2. Then, check if there's a way to select one interval from each c's list such that none of them overlap.

The problem is that for each c, the list can be large. But perhaps for each c, the earliest possible interval (the leftmost possible) can be chosen, and then check if selecting such intervals for all c's leads to non-overlapping. However, this is a greedy approach and may not work. For example, selecting the earliest interval for some c may block other c's from having any valid intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a c and the intervals, and edges connect intervals that do not overlap. But even that seems difficult.

But considering that k is small (up to 17), perhaps a backtracking approach with memoization could work. However, even 2^17 is 131072, and multiplied by the possible positions, this could be manageable.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph between the letters and their intervals, with edges indicating that intervals can coexist (i.e., non-overlapping). But even that is not straightforward.

Alternative Idea:

We can model this as a problem of selecting one interval per c in such a way that the intervals are non-overlapping. To model this, for each c in order, we can track the earliest possible end of the previous intervals. However, this requires the order of selecting c's to be arbitrary, which may not be feasible.

Another Idea: Since all intervals are of length x, the start and end positions are known. So for each c, the intervals can be sorted by their start positions. Then, for each c in some order, select an interval that starts after the end of the previous intervals. But the order in which we select the c's could affect the feasibility.

This is similar to interval graph coloring. But here, we need to select exactly one interval per c (with c from 1 to k), and all selected intervals must be pairwise non-overlapping.

This is equivalent to a problem where you have k groups of intervals (each group represents the possible intervals for a particular c), and you need to select exactly one interval from each group such that all selected intervals are non-overlapping.

This is known as the exact hitting set problem for interval scheduling, which is NP-hard. However, since k is small (up to 17), perhaps we can model this with a meet-in-the-middle approach, but that's not obvious.

Alternatively, for each possible subset of letters, we can track the earliest end of the selected intervals. But I'm not sure.

Wait, here's another Idea: Since all intervals have the same length x, maybe we can model this as a problem where for each c, the earliest possible interval that can be placed after the previous ones. Let's sort the letters in some order, then for each letter in sequence, select the earliest possible interval that starts after the end of the last selected interval. If for all letters we can find such an interval, then x is feasible.

But the order in which we process the letters can affect the outcome. For example, processing a letter with few possible intervals first might allow more flexibility. So this approach might work if we can find a processing order that allows all letters to fit. But how to choose the order? There are k! possible orders, which is 17! ≈ 3.5e14, which is way too big.

Alternatively, we can try all possible orders. But again, this is not feasible.

Hmm. So this seems challenging. Let's think of another approach. Let's consider that for each x, the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals we can select (from all c's possible intervals) is >=k. But even if that's the case, but all intervals are from the same c, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, for each x, the problem reduces to checking if there's a set of intervals, one per c, all of length x, valid for their respective c, and non-overlapping.

To model this, perhaps we can precompute for each c the possible intervals of length x, and then use dynamic programming to track which c's have been processed and the earliest end of the selected intervals.

The state of the DP can be a bitmask representing which letters have had their intervals selected, and the current end position. For each state, we can track the earliest end possible. Then, for each step, we can try to add an interval for a new letter that starts after the current end.

But the DP state would be (mask, end), and for each step, we try adding a new interval for a letter not in the mask. The mask is a bitmask of size k (17 bits). The end can be up to n (2e5). So the total number of states is (2^17) * 2e5 = 131072 * 200000 = 26,214,400,000. Which is way too large.

But perhaps we can optimize this by noting that for a given mask, we can track the earliest possible end. For example, when processing letters in any order, the earliest possible end after selecting a subset of letters would allow the remaining letters to have more options. So, for each mask, we can track the earliest end possible for that mask, and for each new letter, select the earliest interval that starts after that end.

This way, the state can be represented as the mask and the earliest end. So, for each mask, we track the minimum possible end. Then, when adding a new letter, we look for the earliest interval for that letter that starts after the current end. If such an interval exists, then the new end is the end of that interval (start + x -1), and the mask is updated to include the new letter.

Let me formalize this:

Initialize a DP dictionary where the key is the mask and the value is the earliest end. Initially, DP[0] = -1 (no intervals selected, end is before the start of the string).

For each mask in DP:
   For each c not in mask:
       For each interval in c's intervals where the interval's start is > DP[mask]:
           Find the earliest such interval (since we want to minimize the end to allow more intervals later)
           Update the new_mask = mask | (1 << c)
           new_end = interval's end (start + x -1)
           If new_end is not in DP[new_mask] or is earlier than the existing value, update DP[new_mask] to new_end.

After processing all masks, check if the mask with all bits set (all letters processed) exists. If yes, then x is possible.

This approach could be feasible because for each mask, we track the earliest end possible. Then, for each step, when adding a new letter, we choose the earliest possible interval for that letter that starts after the current end. By choosing the earliest possible, we allow the next intervals to start as soon as possible, maximizing the chances of fitting all letters.

The key point is that for each mask, we track the earliest possible end. So even if multiple paths reach the same mask, we only keep the one with the earliest end, as others are not useful. This reduces the state space.

So the steps are:

1. For each c in 1..k, collect all valid intervals of length x. An interval is valid if all characters in the interval are c or ?. For each such interval, note the start and end (end = start + x - 1).

2. For each c, sort the intervals by start time. This allows us to quickly find the earliest interval that starts after a given position.

3. For the DP, track for each mask the earliest end. Initialize with mask 0 and end -1.

4. For each mask in the current DP, and for each c not in the mask, find the earliest interval in c's list that starts after the current end. Since the intervals are sorted, this can be done using binary search.

5. If such an interval exists, compute the new_end (start + x - 1), and update the DP for the new_mask with the minimum possible end.

6. After processing all possibilities, if the full mask (all k bits set) exists in the DP, then x is possible.

This approach reduces the state space by only keeping the earliest end for each mask, which is optimal for further steps. The sorting of intervals for each c allows binary search to find the earliest interval that starts after a given position.

Now, the question is how to implement this efficiently.

Let's break down each step.

First, for a given x, precompute valid intervals for each c.

For each c in 0..k-1 (assuming 0-based letters):

We need to find all intervals [i, i + x - 1] where all characters in s[i..i+x-1] are either c's corresponding character (like 'a' + c) or '?'.

This can be done efficiently using a sliding window approach.

For example, for each position i in 0 to n - x:

Check if in the substring s[i:i+x], all characters are either c's character or '?'. If yes, then add this interval to the list for c.

But for large x (up to 2e5), checking each window in O(x) time would be O(nx), which is O(4e10) for x=2e5 and n=2e5. Which is impossible.

So we need a more efficient way to precompute the valid intervals for each c.

An efficient approach is to precompute a prefix sum array for each c, indicating the number of non-c and non-? characters up to each position. Then, for any interval [i, j], the sum in the prefix array for that interval should be 0.

For each c:

Create an array bad of length n, where bad[i] = 1 if s[i] is not c and not '?', else 0.

Compute the prefix sum array of bad. For any interval [i, j], sum from bad[i] to bad[j] should be 0.

So for a given x, the intervals of length x that are valid for c are the intervals [i, i+x-1] where the sum of bad[i..i+x-1] is 0.

The sum can be computed in O(1) per interval using the prefix array.

So for each c, precompute the prefix sum array. Then, for each possible x, compute the valid intervals for c as all i where the sum from i to i+x-1 is 0.

This way, for each x, the valid intervals for each c can be found in O(n) time per c.

But since k can be up to 17, and for each x we need to process all k c's, the total time for each x would be O(kn).

But since we are doing binary search on x (log n steps), the total time is O(kn log n).

Now, for each x, after collecting the valid intervals for each c, sorted by their start, we can proceed to the DP step.

The DP step:

Initialize a dictionary (or array) where mask 0 has end -1.

For each mask in the DP:

   For each c not in mask:

       Find the earliest interval for c that starts after the current end.

       If such an interval exists, compute the new_end (start + x -1).

       Update the new_mask (mask | (1 << c)) with the minimal new_end.

This way, for each mask and each c, we process the best possible interval.

To find the earliest interval for c that starts after the current end, we can binary search in the list of intervals for c. Since the intervals are sorted by start, the first interval with start > current_end can be found via bisect.

So for each c, the intervals are sorted, and for a given current_end, the earliest interval starts at the smallest start >= (current_end + 1). Because intervals are non-overlapping, the next interval must start after the current_end.

So for each c, and current_end, find the first interval in the c's list where start > current_end.

Once such an interval is found, the new_end is start + x -1.

We can then update the DP state for new_mask with new_end, but only if this new_end is smaller than any existing end for that mask.

By keeping track of the earliest possible end for each mask, we can greedily ensure that subsequent intervals have the earliest possible start, allowing more intervals to fit.

Once all possible masks are processed, if the mask with all bits set (all k letters processed) exists, then x is possible.

So the steps are:

1. Binary search for x between 0 and n.

   For each x:

       a. For each c in 0..k-1, compute all valid intervals of length x.

           For each c:

               Compute the prefix sum of bad for the string.

               For each i in 0 to n-x:

                   sum = prefix[i + x] - prefix[i]

                   if sum == 0:

                       add i to the list of valid intervals for c.

               Sort the list of valid intervals for c by start (i).

       b. For each c, check if there is at least one valid interval. If any c has no valid intervals, x is impossible.

       c. Otherwise, proceed to the DP step.

       d. Initialize DP as a dictionary: {0: -1}

       e. For each mask in DP:

           For each c in 0..k-1:

               if mask does not have c set:

                   get the list of intervals for c.

                   current_end = DP[mask]

                   using binary search, find the first interval in c's list where start > current_end.

                   if such an interval exists:

                       start = interval's start.

                       new_end = start + x -1.

                       new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

                       if new_mask not in DP or new_end < DP[new_mask]:

                           update DP[new_mask] = new_end

       f. After processing all masks, check if the full mask (all bits set) exists in DP.

       g. If yes, then x is possible. Set the answer to x and try higher x.

       h. Else, try lower x.

Now, the problem is the efficiency of step e. Let's analyze the complexity.

For each x:

   For each mask in the DP (up to 2^k = 2^17 = 131072):

       For each c (up to 17):

           Binary search in the list of intervals for c (O(log m), where m is the number of intervals for c).

           For each binary search, O(log m) steps.

But m can be up to O(n) per c, so log m is up to 20.

So for each mask and c, it's O(20) steps.

Total steps per x: 131072 * 17 * 20 = around 4.5 million per x. Since binary search can take up to 20 steps (log n), the total steps would be around 90 million. Which is manageable within 3 seconds.

But this depends on how often the DP steps are executed. However, in practice, many masks are not reachable or are processed only once.

But we can optimize the DP steps by using a priority queue approach, but perhaps it's manageable as is.

Now, the code outline.

First, precompute for each c the prefix sums. Then, for each x, compute the valid intervals.

But wait, the prefix sums for each c can be precomputed once, and for different x, we can compute the valid intervals efficiently.

Wait, yes. For each c, we can precompute the prefix sum array. Then, for any x, the valid intervals are those where the sum of bad[i..i+x-1] is zero.

So precomputing the prefix sum arrays for all c in 0..k-1 is possible once. Then, for each x in the binary search, we can process each c's intervals quickly.

So steps:

1. Precompute for each c, the prefix sum array of bad characters.

   For example, for c=0 (representing 'a'), bad[i] is 1 if s[i] is not 'a' and not '?', else 0.

   Then, compute prefix_c[i] = sum_{0..i-1} bad.

2. Binary search for x in [0, n]:

   low = 0, high = n.

   answer = 0.

   while low <= high:

       mid = (low + high) // 2.

       check if x=mid is possible.

       if possible:

           answer = mid.

           low = mid + 1.

       else:

           high = mid - 1.

   return answer.

3. For the check function:

   For each c in 0..k-1:

       compute the valid intervals of length x.

       intervals[c] = list of start positions where sum from i to i+x-1 is 0.

       if len(intervals[c]) == 0:

           return False.

       sort the intervals[c] by start.

   Then, perform the DP steps.

   Initialize dp as a dictionary: {0: -1}

   for mask in dp:

       for each c not in mask:

           list_of_intervals = intervals[c]

           current_end = dp[mask]

           # find the first interval in list_of_intervals where start > current_end.

           # since list is sorted, use bisect.

           idx = bisect.bisect_right(list_of_intervals, current_end)

           if idx < len(list_of_intervals):

               start = list_of_intervals[idx]

               new_end = start + x - 1

               new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

               if new_end < dp.get(new_mask, float('inf')):

                   dp[new_mask] = new_end

   if full_mask (all bits set) in dp:

       return True

   else:

       return False

But in the code, the 'dp' needs to be processed in a way that allows multiple updates. For example, when processing a mask, new_masks may be added, but we need to process all masks in the current iteration.

But in the code, this is a dynamic process. So for each iteration, we need to process the current state of the dp, and generate new states. So perhaps a BFS-like approach is better.

Alternatively, for each step, we can process the masks in order of increasing number of set bits, to avoid processing the same mask multiple times.

But in practice, using a dictionary and updating it as we go would work.

But in Python, modifying a dictionary while iterating over it can lead to errors. So, to avoid this, we can make a copy of the current dp at each step, and process each mask in the copy, then update the new dp.

Wait, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:

Initialize dp as a dictionary.

For each step in processing masks:

   Create a temporary dictionary tmp_dp.

   For each mask in dp:

       For each c not in mask:

           check if the interval exists.

           if yes:

               new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

               compute new_end.

               if new_mask is not in tmp_dp or new_end is better (smaller):

                   tmp_dp[new_mask] = min(new_end, existing value)

   Update dp with tmp_dp.

But this approach may not work as the order of processing can affect the results. However, since we are processing all possible masks in each step, and the tmp_dp accumulates the best possible new_end for each new_mask, it should be manageable.

But how to handle the possibility of multiple c's being processed in different orders. For example, processing c1 first, then c2, versus c2 first, then c1.

But by using the mask-based approach, the code automatically considers all possible combinations. However, this approach is not feasible for k=17, as the number of masks is 2^17=131072. But perhaps with the early termination (if new_end is not better than existing, skip), this can be manageable.

Alternatively, the code can process the masks in the current dp and, for each, generate new masks by adding each possible c not present in the mask. For each new_mask, the code tracks the minimal end possible.

So the code in Python would look like:

def is_possible(x):

    intervals = []

    for c in range(k):

        # Compute valid intervals for c of length x.

        # Use the prefix sum array.

        prefix = prefix_c[c]

        valid = []

        for i in range(n - x + 1):

            if prefix[i + x] - prefix[i] == 0:

                valid.append(i)

        if not valid:

            return False

        intervals.append(valid)

    # Now, intervals[c] is sorted (since i increases).

    # Perform DP.

    dp = {0: -1}

    for _ in range(k):

        new_dp = {}

        for mask in dp:

            current_end = dp[mask]

            for c in range(k):

                if not (mask & (1 << c)):

                    # Find the first interval in intervals[c] with start > current_end.

                    idx = bisect.bisect_right(intervals[c], current_end)

                    if idx < len(intervals[c]):

                        start = intervals[c][idx]

                        new_end = start + x

                        new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

                        if new_mask not in new_dp or new_end < new_dp[new_mask]:

                            new_dp[new_mask] = new_end

        if not new_dp:

            break

        dp = new_dp

    # Check if the full mask is present.

    full_mask = (1 << k) - 1

    return full_mask in dp

Wait, but this code may not work. Because each step adds exactly one more c. But the for loop runs for k steps, and in each step, it tries to add one c. However, this approach could miss some paths where multiple c's are added in a single step.

Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to process all possible masks in each step until no more progress is made.

Another Idea: The code can use a BFS-like approach, where masks are processed in order of the number of bits set. For each mask with m bits set, process adding each possible c to form masks with m+1 bits set. For each such new mask, track the minimal end.

This can be implemented by maintaining the DP dictionary and iterating through each mask in order of increasing bits.

But in Python, this can be done by keeping the masks in a priority queue ordered by the number of bits set, but it's easier to process the masks in any order, as long as for each new_mask, we track the minimal end.

But the code I proposed earlier may not work correctly. Let's think.

The code initializes dp as {0: -1}.

Then, for each step in a loop of k times (since we need to add k letters), it creates a new_dp and processes all masks in the current dp. For each mask in current dp, and each c not in the mask, it finds the earliest possible interval for c after the current_end. If found, it adds the new_mask to new_dp with the new_end (start + x -1). Then, after processing all masks, dp is updated to new_dp.

But this approach assumes that adding a single c in each step is sufficient. But in reality, a mask can have multiple bits set. So this approach would allow adding multiple c's in each step. However, the loop runs k times, which would allow for up to k additions, but in reality, the loop would terminate once all possible masks are processed.

But this code is incorrect. For example, if there's a mask with 0 bits set, and adding c1 and c2 in a single step, the code would process each c in sequence. But the new_dp would contain masks with 1 bit set, and in the next iteration, process those masks and add another bit.

Thus, the code would require k iterations to reach the full mask. Each iteration allows adding one more c. But the code may not find the optimal path, but perhaps this approach is manageable.

But this approach would not work. For example, if the mask can be built by adding two c's in one iteration, but the code processes each step only once, adding one c per step.

So the correct approach is to process all masks in the current DP, and for each, generate all possible new masks by adding any possible c (not already in the mask) and selecting their interval. This can be done with a BFS approach, where masks are processed in any order, and new masks are added as they are discovered.

So the correct code is:

Initialize dp as {0: -1}.

Create a queue or process all masks in the current dp.

For each mask in the current dp:

   current_end = dp[mask]

   for each c not in mask:

       find the earliest interval for c that starts after current_end.

       if exists:

           new_end = start + x -1.

           new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

           if new_mask not in dp or new_end < dp[new_mask]:

               update dp[new_mask] = new_end.

Repeat this until no more updates are possible.

But this is a standard BFS with dynamic programming. To implement this, we can use a while loop that continues to process masks until no more improvements can be made.

But how to efficiently implement this in Python.

Alternatively, using a deque to process masks in order, and for each, generate new masks. However, this can lead to multiple processing of the same mask if new_end is better.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can process the masks in a way that ensures that each mask is processed once, and any new mask is added to the queue if a better end is found.

But given the time, perhaps the code would look like this:

def is_possible(x):

    # Precompute intervals for each c.

    intervals = []

    for c in range(k):

        # Compute valid intervals of length x for c.

        # Using prefix sum.

        valid = []

        for i in range(n - x + 1):

            if prefix_c[c][i + x] - prefix_c[c][i] == 0:

                valid.append(i)

        if not valid:

            return False

        intervals.append(valid)

    # Now, intervals for each c are sorted.

    # Initialize DP.

    from collections import deque

    dp = {0: -1}

    queue = deque([0])

    # To track whether a mask has been processed.

    # We need to process masks in the order they are discovered.

    while queue:

        mask = queue.popleft()

        current_end = dp[mask]

        for c in range(k):

            if not (mask & (1 << c)):

                # Find the first interval in intervals[c] where start > current_end.

                idx = bisect.bisect_right(intervals[c], current_end)

                if idx < len(intervals[c]):

                    start = intervals[c][idx]

                    new_end = start + x - 1

                    new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

                    if new_mask not in dp or new_end < dp[new_mask]:

                        dp[new_mask] = new_end

                        queue.append(new_mask)

    # Check if full_mask is present.

    full_mask = (1 << k) - 1

    return full_mask in dp

But this code may not work because once a mask is added to the queue, any further updates to it (with a better end) would not be processed. For example, if a mask is processed with a certain end, and later a new way to reach the mask with an earlier end is found, the queue would not process it again, leaving the dp with a suboptimal end.

Thus, to handle this properly, we need to process masks in a way that whenever a new, better end is found for a mask, it is reprocessed. But this would lead to an infinite loop in some cases.

Thus, this approach is not feasible. Hence, the original approach of processing the masks in batches and for each step, generating new_masks with one more bit set is better.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to process masks in order of the number of bits set. For example, process all masks with m bits set before those with m+1 bits set. This way, when processing a mask, all masks with fewer bits have already been processed, and the best possible end for them is known.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

Initialize dp as {0: -1}.

For m in 0 to k-1:

    For each mask in dp with m bits set:

        For each c not in mask:

            find the earliest interval for c that starts after dp[mask].

            if exists:

                new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

                new_end = start + x -1

                if new_mask not in dp or new_end < dp[new_mask]:

                    dp[new_mask] = new_end

After processing all masks, check if the full mask is in dp.

This way, masks are processed in order of the number of bits set. For example, masks with 0 bits are processed first, then masks with 1 bit, and so on. This ensures that when processing a mask, all possible ways to reach it with m bits have been considered, and the best end is stored.

This approach can be implemented using a list of masks grouped by the number of bits set.

In Python:

def is_possible(x):

    intervals = []

    for c in range(k):

        valid = []

        for i in range(n - x + 1):

            if prefix_c[c][i + x] - prefix_c[c][i] == 0:

                valid.append(i)

        if not valid:

            return False

        intervals.append(valid)

    # Now, perform DP.

    dp = {}

    dp[0] = -1

    # Group masks by the number of bits set.

    for bits in range(k):

        # Iterate through all masks with 'bits' number of bits set.

        # We need to process masks in the order of increasing bits.

        masks = [mask for mask in dp if bin(mask).count('1') == bits]

        for mask in masks:

            current_end = dp[mask]

            for c in range(k):

                if not (mask & (1 << c)):

                    # Find the first interval for c after current_end.

                    idx = bisect.bisect_right(intervals[c], current_end)

                    if idx < len(intervals[c]):

                        start = intervals[c][idx]

                        new_end = start + x - 1

                        new_mask = mask | (1 << c)

                        if new_mask not in dp or new_end < dp[new_mask]:

                            dp[new_mask] = new_end

    full_mask = (1 << k) - 1

    return full_mask in dp

This approach ensures that masks are processed in order of the number of bits set, so that when adding a new c to a mask with m bits, the mask is processed after all masks with m bits have been handled.

This should work correctly.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:

10 2

a??ab????b

After replacing, the answer is 4.

For x=4, the code should find valid intervals for both letters.

For 'a' (c=0), the valid intervals of length 4 are:

Check positions where s[i..i+3] can be made into 'a's.

Original string: a??ab????b.

Looking for intervals of 4:

i=0: a, ?, ?, a? The substring is a??a. The sum of bad characters (non a and non ?) is 0. So valid.

i=1: ?aab? No, because the substring includes 'ab' later.

Wait, perhaps for c=0 (a), the valid intervals are [0..3], [1..4] (but s[4] is 'b', which is not a or ?). So no. So for c=0, valid intervals are those where all characters are a or ?.

Let's compute the prefix sum for c=0 (a):

The bad array for c=0 is 1 for characters not a or ?.

Original string: a ? ? a b ? ? ? ? b.

For each position:

0: a → bad[0] = 0.

1: ? → 0.

2: ? →0.

3: a →0.

4: b →1.

5: ? →0.

6: ? →0.

7: ? →0.

8: ? →0.

9: b →1.

prefix_sum for c=0:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 0 (0+0)

prefix[2] = 0

prefix[3] = 0

prefix[4] = 0 (sum of first 4 elements: 0,0,0,0 → sum is 0 for i=0 to 3)

prefix[5] = 0+1=1 (i=4's bad is 1)

prefix[6] = 1+0=1

prefix[7] = 1+0=1

prefix[8] = 1+0=1

prefix[9] = 1+0=1

prefix[10] = 1+0=1+1=2.

Wait, the prefix sum array is cumulative. So for x=4:

For c=0, valid intervals are those where sum from i to i+3 is 0.

i=0: sum prefix[0+4] - prefix[0] = prefix[4] - prefix[0] = 0-0=0 → valid.

i=1: sum prefix[5] - prefix[1] = 1-0=1 → not valid.

i=2: prefix[6] - prefix[2] = 1-0=1 → invalid.

i=3: prefix[7] - prefix[3] = 1-0=1 → invalid.

i=4: prefix[8] - prefix[4] = 1-0=1 → invalid.

etc. So for c=0, the only valid interval is i=0, start=0.

So intervals[c=0] = [0].

For c=1 (b):

The bad array for c=1 is 1 for characters not b or ?.

Original string:

Position 0: a →1.

1: ? →0.

2: ? →0.

3: a →1.

4: b →0.

5: ? →0.

6: ? →0.

7: ? →0.

8: ? →0.

9: b →0.

prefix_sum for c=1:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =1 (bad[0] is 1)

prefix[2] =1 (bad[0] + bad[1] is 1+0=1)

prefix[3] =1 (sum up to index 2: 1+0+0=1)

prefix[4] =1+1=2 (bad[3] is 1)

prefix[5] =2+0=2 (bad[4] is 0)

prefix[6] =2+0=2

prefix[7] =2+0=2

prefix[8] =2+0=2

prefix[9] =2+0=2

prefix[10] =2+0=2.

So for x=4, intervals for c=1 are those where sum from i to i+3 is 0.

i=5:

sum prefix[5+4] - prefix[5] = prefix[9] - prefix[5] = 2-2=0 → valid. So start=5.

i=5: positions 5-8: all ? and possibly b.

So for c=1, valid intervals are start=5 (positions 5-8), and others?

Check other i's:

i=6: sum prefix[10] - prefix[6] = 2-2=0 → valid. start=6.

i=7: i+3=10, which is beyond the string (n=10). So i can be up to 6.

Wait, the string length is 10, so valid i ranges from 0 to 6 (i +x-1 must be <n, so x=4: i can be 0..6.

Wait, for x=4, the valid i's are 0 to 6 (since i+3 must be <=9 for n=10).

So for c=1:

i=5: sum is prefix[5+4] - prefix[5] = prefix[9] - prefix[5] = 2-2=0 → valid.

i=6: sum is prefix[6+4] - prefix[6] = prefix[10] - prefix[6] =2-2=0 → valid.

So intervals for c=1 are [5, 6].

So in this case, during the DP step:

mask=0 (bits=0), current_end=-1.

Processing c=0:

find first interval in c=0's list (start=0) where start > -1 → 0.

new_end =0+3=3.

new_mask=1<<0=1.

Then, processing c=1:

find first interval in c=1's list (starts at 5 and 6) where start >-1 → 5.

new_end=5+3=8.

new_mask=1<<1=2.

So after processing mask=0, the new masks are 1 (end 3) and 2 (end 8).

Then, for masks with 1 bit set (bits=1):

mask=1 (current_end=3):

processing c=1:

find first interval for c=1 where start>3. The intervals are [5,6], so idx=0, start=5.

new_end=5+3=8.

new_mask=1 | 2 =3.

mask=2 (current_end=8):

processing c=0:

find first interval for c=0 where start>8. The intervals for c=0 are [0], which is <=8. So no.

Thus, new_mask=3 is added with end 8.

Then, processing mask=3 (bits=2), which is the full_mask (k=2).

Thus, full_mask is present, so x=4 is possible.

Hence, the code would return True for x=4.

This aligns with the first example.

The code should work.

Now, let's think about the third example:

input:

2 3
??

The output is 0.

Because k=3, but the string is ??, which can be replaced with two letters. So after replacement, at least one of the 3 letters is not present, so its f_i is 0. So the minimum is 0.

For x=0, the code returns True. For any x>0, the code returns False.

But how does the code handle this?

For x=1:

for each c in 0,1,2:

valid intervals of length 1. Each position i can be replaced with c's letter. So for each c, intervals are [0,1].

So all intervals are valid.

But during the DP step, we need to select three intervals (for c=0,1,2) of length 1, non-overlapping.

But since the string has only two characters, it's impossible to select three non-overlapping intervals of length 1. Hence, the code returns False, and the binary search will set answer to 0.

Thus, the code correctly returns 0.

Thus, the code seems to handle the examples correctly.

Now, time to implement the code.

First, precompute the prefix sums for each c.

Then, binary search.

Now, in Python, we can represent the prefix sums for each c as a list.

But for each c, the bad array is 1 if s[i] is not c's character and not '?'.

Then, the prefix sum array can be computed.

But in Python, we can process this as follows:

For each c in 0..k-1:

   char = chr(ord('a') + c)

   prefix = [0] * (n + 1)

   for i in range(n):

       prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + (0 if s[i] == char or s[i] == '?' else 1)

Thus, for each c, prefix[i] is the sum of bad characters up to index i-1.

Then, for a given x, the valid intervals for c are those i where prefix[i+x] - prefix[i] == 0.

Now, the code:

Read n and k.

Read s.

Precompute the prefix arrays for each c.

Then, binary search.

Now, let's write the code.

But since the code must read input from stdin and write to stdout, and not have any debug prints, here's the code:

But we need to handle the case where k=17, and the letters are 'a' to 'q'.

Also, the code must precompute prefix arrays for each c.

Now, the code:

import bisect

n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input().strip()

prefix_c = []
for c in range(k):
    char = chr(ord('a') + c)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == char or s[i] == '?':
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i]
        else:
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + 1
    prefix_c.append(prefix)

low = 0
high = n
ans = 0

def is_possible(x):
    if x == 0:
        return True
    if x > n:
        return False
    intervals = []
    for c in range(k):
        valid = []
        for i in range(n - x + 1):
            if prefix_c[c][i + x] - prefix_c[c][i] == 0:
                valid.append(i)
        if not valid:
            return False
        intervals.append(valid)
    # Now perform DP.
    dp = {0: -1}
    for bits in range(k):
        masks = [mask for mask in dp if bin(mask).count('1') == bits]
        for mask in masks:
            current_end = dp[mask]
            for c in range(k):
                if not (mask & (1 << c)):
                    # Find the first interval in intervals[c] with start > current_end
                    idx = bisect.bisect_right(intervals[c], current_end)
                    if idx < len(intervals[c]):
                        start = intervals[c][idx]
                        new_end = start + x - 1
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << c)
                        if new_mask not in dp or new_end < dp.get(new_mask, float('inf')):
                            dp[new_mask] = new_end
    full_mask = (1 << k) - 1
    return full_mask in dp

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if is_possible(mid):
        ans = mid
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1

print(ans)

This code should handle all cases.

Testing with the third example:

n=2, k=3.

For x=1:

Each c has valid intervals [0, 1].

But in the DP step, mask 0 can add c=0 (start=0, end=0), c=1 (start=0, end=0), or c=2 (start=0, end=0).

Then, for masks with 1 bit, trying to add another c.

But the next c's interval must start after end=0. For example, adding c=1:

start=0 is not >0. So idx = bisect_right([0,1], 0) → returns 2, which is beyond len(intervals[c=1] which has [0,1]. So no interval is found.

Thus, the code returns False for x=1. The binary search would set high=0 and ans=0.

Hence, the code works.

Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.
