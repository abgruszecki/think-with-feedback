Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get by flipping the signs of some elements in the sequence. Hmm. 

First, I need to understand what an inversion is. An inversion is a pair (i, j) where i < j and a_i > a_j. Jeff can flip the sign of any elements. So for each element, he can choose to make it positive or negative. The goal is to choose these signs such that the total number of inversions is minimized.

The key here is to model this as a dynamic programming problem, perhaps. Because for each position, the choice (flip or not) affects the inversions with all previous elements. But how do we track the state efficiently?

Let me think. Let's consider each element in the sequence one by one. For each element, we can decide whether to flip it or not. The decision at each step depends on the previous choices, but keeping track of all possibilities directly would be too slow for n up to 2000.

Wait, but maybe the state can be something like, for each position i, and some parameters related to the elements before i, we track the minimal number of inversions. But what parameters do we need?

Alternatively, when processing the i-th element, the inversions are contributed by how this element compares to all previous elements (those before i). So for each element, when making the decision to flip or not, the effect on inversions is the sum of comparisons with all previous elements. 

But with n=2000, a naive approach would be O(n^2), which is 4 million operations. But if the DP state is per element and per some state, maybe it's manageable.

Wait, but for each element, the choice to flip it (making it x or -x) affects all the subsequent elements. So perhaps, the DP state should track for each position i, the choices made for previous elements and the current state (whether the current element is flipped or not), along with some information that allows us to compute the inversions efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe the decision for each element can be considered in a way that allows us to compute the minimal inversions up to that point, considering whether the element is flipped or not. 

Let me try to model this. Let's say dp[i][s] represents the minimal number of inversions up to the i-th element, where s represents the state (flipped or not) of the i-th element. But how do the previous choices affect this?

Wait, for each element, when we process it, we have two choices: keep it as p[i], or flip to -p[i]. For each choice, we need to compute how many inversions are added by this element with all previous elements. The previous elements have already been processed, so for each previous j < i, the state (whether j was flipped) affects whether a_j is greater than a_i (after possible flips). 

So for the i-th element, the number of new inversions added when choosing to flip or not is the sum over all j < i of (a_j (after flip) > current a_i (after flip)). 

But if we track the state of each previous element, that's impossible for n=2000. So we need a way to represent the state of the previous elements in a way that allows us to compute the number of inversions quickly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each position i, for both possible choices (flip or not), the number of elements before i that are greater than the chosen value. Then, the DP can track the minimal inversions considering the choices made up to i.

Wait, here's an idea. For each element i, when deciding to flip or not, we can calculate how many elements before i (j < i) are such that after their flip decision, their value is greater than the current element's value. Then, the DP would track the minimal inversions considering all possible choices up to i.

But the problem is that the previous elements' choices (whether they were flipped) affect the current count. So for the current element i, if we choose to flip it to -p[i], then for each j < i, the value of a_j (which could be p[j] or -p[j], depending on their choice) must be compared to -p[i]. So, for each i, the decision to flip affects the comparison with all previous elements.

But tracking all possible combinations of previous flip decisions is impossible for n=2000. So we need a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps the order in which we process the elements allows us to precompute certain information. Let's think of processing the elements in order. For each element i, when making the flip decision, the key is to know, for all j < i, how many of them are in a state (flipped or not) such that their value is greater than the current element's chosen value (either p[i] or -p[i]).

But since we can't track all possible previous states, perhaps the DP state for each i can track the number of elements j < i that are in a flipped state, but how? That's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe for each element i, we can precompute two values: the number of elements j < i that, if kept as is, would be greater than a_i (if kept) and greater than -a_i (if flipped). Similarly for when j is flipped. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: for each position i, when considering flipping or not, the total inversions added is the sum of inversions with all previous elements. So, for each previous j, the choice of whether j was flipped and whether i is flipped will determine if a_j (after flip) is greater than a_i (after flip). The total inversions added for i is the count of j's where this is true.

But since the choice for j's is part of the DP state, how can we model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal choice for each j up to i-1 is already considered in the DP state. So when we process i, for each possible choice (flip or not), we can compute the minimal inversions by considering all possible choices of previous flips. But this seems unmanageable.

Wait, but perhaps for each element i, the choice to flip it or not can be made in a way that depends only on the current element's possible values and the best possible state up to i-1. Let me model this.

Suppose that for each element i, we track two possibilities: whether we flipped it (state 1) or not (state 0). For each of these states, we need to track the minimal number of inversions up to i.

To compute this, for each state (0 or 1) of i, we need to consider all possible previous states (0 or 1 for each j < i). But that's again impossible for large i.

Wait, but maybe the state can be represented by the current element's value, and the DP transitions can be computed based on the previous elements' states. But how?

Alternatively, when processing the i-th element, for each possible choice (flip or not), we can compute the number of new inversions added by comparing with all previous elements, which themselves could have been flipped or not. But since we want the minimal total inversions, the DP for i would choose for each previous state (whether j was flipped) the best possible option.

But perhaps, for each previous j, the optimal choice (flip or not) has already been made such that it contributes the least to the inversion count when considering the current i's choice.

Wait, here's a key insight: when processing i, the decision to flip or not for i affects all previous j's. But for each j < i, the optimal decision for j (flip or not) would have been made in a way that minimizes the inversions up to j. So when processing i, for each possible choice (flip or not) of i, the inversion count added is the sum over j < i of the number of j's where (a_j's optimal choice) > (a_i's current choice). But how do we track this?

Hmm. Maybe the optimal choice for each j is to choose the state (flip or not) that results in the minimal inversions up to j, given the previous choices. But when processing j, the choice depends on how it affects future elements. Wait, no. Because the decision to flip j affects both the inversions between j and all elements before it, and between j and all elements after it.

So, this complicates things. Because flipping j can affect inversions with elements that come after j, like i.

Therefore, the problem is not straightforward, as the choice for j affects both past and future elements.

This suggests that a greedy approach might not work. For example, flipping j might decrease inversions with elements before j but increase inversions with elements after j. So, the optimal choice for j depends on all future elements.

This seems like a problem that requires dynamic programming, but the state needs to capture enough information to account for the impact of previous choices on future inversions.

An alternative approach is to model the DP state as, for each position i, and for each possible choice (flip or not), the minimal number of inversions up to i, along with some information about how the elements before i are ordered. But what information is necessary?

Perhaps, for each element i and each possible choice (flip or not), track the number of elements before i that are larger than the current element's value (after flipping). Then, the inversion count for that choice would be the sum of that number plus the minimal inversions from the previous elements.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let's say for each i, we can choose to take x = p[i] or x = -p[i]. For each choice, the number of new inversions added is the count of elements j < i where a_j's chosen value (either p[j] or -p[j]) is greater than x. Then, the total inversions is the sum of previous inversions plus this count.

But how do we compute this count efficiently?

If for each i, and for each possible choice (x being p[i] or -p[i]), we can quickly compute how many elements before i (in their optimal choices) are greater than x, then we can choose the minimal inversion count.

But the problem is that the optimal choices for j < i are interdependent. For example, j's choice might have been made to minimize inversions up to j, but that choice affects the count for i's choice.

Thus, perhaps the DP approach needs to track, for each position i and each possible choice (flip or not), the minimal inversion count up to i, along with the information that allows us to compute the number of elements after i that would form inversions with previous choices.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i and each possible choice (flip or not), we track the minimal inversion count up to i, and for each j > i, when they process j, they can compute how many elements before j (including i) are greater than j's chosen value.

But this seems tricky. Let's think about how to model this.

Suppose we process the elements in order. For each element i, we have two options: flip or not. For each option, we need to compute:

1. The number of elements j < i where the chosen value for j (after their flip decision) is greater than the current choice for i. This contributes to the inversion count.

But how do we know how many j's are such that their chosen value is greater than x (current choice of i)?

If for each j < i, the optimal choice for j (flip or not) is determined by the DP state up to j, then when processing i, we can't just look back at the actual choices made for j, because they depend on the DP's state transitions.

This seems like a chicken and egg problem. The optimal choice for j depends on the choices made for elements after j, and vice versa.

So perhaps a dynamic programming approach that for each i and each possible choice (flip or not) of i, tracks the minimal number of inversions up to i, and also keeps track of some data structure that allows us to compute, for future elements, how many of the previous elements (up to i) are greater than a certain value.

Wait, this might be possible. For example, when processing the i-th element, for each possible choice (flip or not), we can maintain a sorted list or a structure that allows us to query the number of elements greater than a certain value. Then, for future elements, when they make a choice (flip or not), they can query this structure to find how many elements before them are larger than their chosen value.

But maintaining such a structure for each possible state (flip choices up to i) is impossible due to memory constraints, as there are 2^i possible combinations.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: since the order of processing is from left to right, perhaps for each i, the choice to flip or not can be made based on the best possible state up to i-1, and some cumulative information that allows us to calculate the required inversions.

Wait, here's another approach. Let's model the problem with dynamic programming where for each position i and each possible choice (flip or not), we track two things:

- The minimal number of inversions up to i (including i) when choosing to flip or not.
- A data structure that allows us to quickly compute the number of elements before i that are greater than a certain value (like the current element's chosen value), which would be needed when processing future elements.

But for n=2000, maintaining a data structure for each state (flip or not) up to i would be O(n^2) time and space, which might be manageable.

Wait, let's see. For each i, and for each choice (flip or not), we can track the minimal inversions and a sorted list of the elements up to i (based on their chosen values). Then, when processing i+1, for each possible choice (flip or not), we can query the sorted lists from the previous step to find how many elements in those lists are greater than the current choice's value. Then, we can choose the minimal inversion count for each state.

But the problem here is that for each i, we have two possibilities (flip or not), and each of those possibilities would require their own sorted list. So for each step i, the number of sorted lists could double. But this is not feasible for i=2000, as 2^2000 is way too big.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So perhaps another angle is needed.

Another observation: When deciding whether to flip an element, the optimal choice for each element can be determined based on the elements before it. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal choice for each element i is to choose the value (x = p[i] or x = -p[i]) that results in the minimal number of new inversions when considering all possible choices for previous elements. But since the previous elements' choices affect this, it's not clear.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to model the problem such that for each element, the choice to flip or not depends on the elements before it. Let me think.

Suppose we process elements from left to right. For each element i, when deciding to flip or not, we need to consider all previous elements j < i. For each j, we have already made a decision (flip or not) that gives the minimal inversion count up to j. Then, for each possible choice (flip or not) for i, the number of new inversions added is the sum over j < i of whether the chosen value for j is greater than the chosen value for i. 

But how can we compute this sum efficiently? Because for each j, we have a choice (flip or not) that was made to optimize the inversion count up to j, but for the current i's choice, the j's choice may not be known. 

Wait, perhaps the DP state for each i must track not only the minimal inversion count but also the set of possible chosen values for each j. But again, this seems impossible for n=2000.

Alternative idea: for each i, the choice to flip or not is independent of the choices made for j > i. So when making the choice for i, we can consider all possible j < i, but j's choices have already been fixed. Therefore, when considering i's choice, the inversion count added is the sum over j < i of (a_j's chosen value) > (a_i's current choice). 

But how do we track the a_j's chosen values?

Wait, perhaps for each j < i, the optimal choice (flip or not) was made in such a way that, when considering the inversions up to j, but when processing i, we need to know all the a_j's chosen values to compute the inversions between j and i.

But this is a problem because the a_j's choices were made based on their own considerations (minimizing inversions up to j), not considering future elements like i.

Therefore, the decision to flip j may not be optimal when considering future elements. This is the crux of the problem. The choices are interdependent, and a greedy approach might not work.

Hmm. So the key is that flipping j can affect the number of inversions between j and all elements after j. Therefore, the optimal decision for j must take into account all elements after j. But that's computationally infeasible for n=2000 unless there's a way to model this efficiently.

Let's think differently. Suppose that for each element i, we decide whether to flip it or not, and we track the set of all elements so far. For each possible choice (flip or not), the number of inversions added is the number of elements in the set that are greater than the current element's value (after flipping). Then, the minimal inversion count is tracked through DP, and the set is maintained in a sorted manner for efficient querying.

But how can we track the set for each possible choice sequence up to i?

This approach again leads to the problem of exponential state growth. For each i, there are two possible choices, leading to 2^i possible states. For i=2000, this is impossible.

Alternative approach: maybe for each element i, the optimal decision (flip or not) depends only on the elements before i, and the way the elements are ordered. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the total number of inversions is the sum of all pairs (i, j) where i < j and a_i > a_j (after flips). So the problem is equivalent to choosing a sign for each element to minimize the total number of such pairs.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph, where each node represents a state, and edges represent the choice of flipping or not. The weight of the edge is the number of new inversions added by that choice. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the start to the end of the sequence, where each node in the path represents the state up to that element.

But even here, the state would need to capture enough information about the previous elements to calculate the new inversions. For n=2000, this is again not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each element i, when we choose to flip or not, the inversion count added is the number of elements before i that are larger than the current choice, plus the number of elements after i that are smaller than the current choice. But this requires knowing all elements after i, which is not possible when processing from left to right.

Alternatively, if we process elements from right to left, then when making a decision for i, the elements after i have already been processed, and their choices are known. So for i's decision, the inversion count added would be the sum of:

1. The number of elements j < i (processed after i in this reversed approach) where their chosen value is less than the current i's value (since i is now before j in the original sequence).

But I'm not sure if processing right to left helps. Let's think.

Suppose we process elements in reverse order. For each element i (starting from the end), we decide to flip it or not. The inversion count contributed by i is the number of elements j that are after i (in original order) which are smaller than the current i's chosen value. These j elements have already been processed, so their choices are known.

But even here, the decision for i depends on all j > i. So if we process in reverse, for each i, the decision (flip or not) can be made based on the already processed j > i. Then, the inversion count for i is the count of j > i where a_i's chosen value > a_j's chosen value. But since j's choices are already fixed, this is manageable.

But how does this affect the overall inversion count?

Wait, when processing i in reverse order (from n down to 1), for each i, the number of inversions added by i is the number of j > i where a_i's chosen value is greater than a_j's chosen value. Because in the original sequence, i < j, and inversion is when a_i > a_j. So for the current i, which is being processed after j (since we're processing in reverse), the j's have already had their choices made. Thus, for each i, the decision to flip or not can be made based on the minimum possible inversions from j > i.

But this approach might work. Let's see.

In this reverse processing approach, for each i, when making the decision to flip or not, we can track the minimal inversion count from i to n. The DP state would be, for each i and possible choice (flip or not), the minimal number of inversions considering elements i to n.

For example, when processing i, we can choose to flip or not. For each choice, the inversion count would be the number of elements j > i where a_i's chosen value is greater than a_j's chosen value (fixed from previous steps), plus the minimal inversion count from j = i+1 to n.

But how do we compute the number of elements j > i where a_i's chosen value (x) is greater than a_j's chosen value (which could be either p[j] or -p[j], depending on the decision made for j)?

Wait, no. When processing in reverse order (i from n down to 1), for each j > i, their choices have already been made. So for each i, when considering flipping or not, the inversion count from j > i is the sum over j > i of (x_i > x_j), where x_j is the chosen value for j (already determined). So the DP for i can consider both possible x_i values (p[i] and -p[i]) and for each, compute how many j's are already in the processed set (j > i) that have x_j < x_i. Then, the inversion count for the current choice is that number plus the minimal inversion count from the next step (i+1) when the best choice (flip or not) was made for i+1 and beyond.

Wait, perhaps this approach is manageable. Let's model this.

We can model the problem with a dynamic programming approach where for each i, we track two possible states: flip (x = -p[i]) or not (x = p[i]). For each state, the minimal inversion count from i to n is stored.

The base case is when i = n, there are no elements after it, so the inversion count is 0 regardless of the choice.

For i < n, when processing in reverse order:

For each possible choice (flip or not), compute x_i (p[i] or -p[i]). The inversion count contributed by this choice is the number of j > i where x_i > x_j (since j is after i in the original sequence, and inversion is when a_i > a_j). Additionally, we need to add the minimal inversion count from i+1 to n (since j > i includes j = i+1 to n).

But how do we compute the number of j > i where x_j (already chosen) is less than x_i?

If we can maintain a data structure that allows us to query, for a given x_i, how many elements in the set {x_j for j > i} are less than x_i, then this can be done efficiently.

So here's the plan:

1. Process elements from the end (i = n down to 1).

2. For each i, decide whether to flip it or not. For each choice (flip or not), compute the number of inversions added by this choice (count of x_j < x_i for j > i), and add the minimal inversions from the DP state of i+1.

3. For each choice (flip or not) at i, keep track of the minimal inversion count.

4. Maintain a data structure that holds all x_j for j > i (processed so far) to quickly compute how many are less than x_i.

This approach seems feasible. Let's see:

For each i, after processing i+1 to n, we have a data structure that contains all x_j (the optimal choice for j, which is either p[j] or -p[j]) for j > i. Then, for each possible choice (x_i = p[i] or x_i = -p[i]), we can query the data structure to find how many x_j are less than x_i. That count is the number of inversions contributed by i and the elements after it (j > i). Then, the DP for i can choose the minimal between flipping and not flipping, considering this count plus the DP from i+1.

Wait, but wait: the DP state for i would be the minimal inversion count from i to n. So for each i, when you choose to flip or not, you have to compute:

current_inversions = number of j > i where x_i > x_j_choice (x_j is chosen optimally for j) + DP[i+1]

But wait, no. Because the x_j_choice is the optimal choice for j, which would have been made in the previous steps (processing j from n down to i+1). So when processing i, the x_j for j > i are already fixed. Therefore, for each i, the data structure can be built as we process the elements. Because when you process i, you add x_i's chosen value to the data structure, and for i-1, you can query it.

Wait, no. Processing is from the end. So for example, processing i = n, then i = n-1, etc. So when processing i = k, the elements j > k are i = k+1 to n. These elements have already been processed, and their x_j values are already determined (their optimal choice is already chosen). Therefore, when processing i = k, we can query the data structure (which contains x_j for j > k) to find how many x_j are less than the current x_i (for each possible choice of x_i).

But how do we know which x_j's to include in the data structure? Because when processing i = k, we have to choose the best possible x_k (flip or not), which will then be added to the data structure for use in processing i = k-1.

Wait, this is correct. Let me clarify:

The data structure is built as we process elements. We start with an empty data structure. Then, for i = n down to 1:

For i = n:

- We choose to flip or not. The inversion count for i is 0 (no elements after it). So for each choice (flip or not), the inversion count is 0. We choose the one with the minimal inversion count (which would be the same as 0, so we can pick either). Then, the chosen x_n (p[n] or -p[n]) is added to the data structure.

For i = n-1:

- We compute for each possible x_i (p[i] or -p[i]) the number of elements in the data structure (which are the x_j for j > i) that are less than x_i. This count is the number of inversions contributed by i and the elements after it. Then, since the data structure for j > i includes x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ..., x_n (all chosen optimally), the DP for i is the minimal inversion count between flipping and not flipping, plus the DP for i+1 (which includes the inversions from j > i+1).

Wait, but the DP[i] for each choice (flip or not) is the number of inversions added by choosing that x_i (the count from the data structure) plus the DP[i+1] (the minimal inversion count from j >= i+1). Because after choosing x_i, the inversions for i include the ones between i and j > i, plus all the inversions from j > i.

So the DP[i][state] = count_of_j_>i_where_x_j < x_i + DP[i+1][best_state].

But how do we track the DP[i+1][best_state]? Because for each i+1, we have two possible states (flip or not), and we choose the one with the minimal inversion count.

So the recurrence would be:

For each i, processing from n-1 down to 1:

When considering flipping (x_i = -p[i]):

count = number of elements in the data structure that are less than x_i.

Then, the inversion count for this choice is count + DP[i+1][0] (assuming DP[i+1][0] is the minimal inversion count for i+1, but wait no—maybe DP[i+1] is the minimal of the two possible choices for i+1).

Wait, but when processing i+1, we have two possible choices (flip or not) and their corresponding inversion counts. For the current i's choice, the inversion count is the count of j > i where x_i > x_j, plus the minimal inversion count from i+1 to n (which is the minimal of the two possible choices for i+1).

No. Wait, the DP[i][s] should represent the minimal inversion count from i to n, given that we choose to flip (s=1) or not (s=0) for i. Then, for each choice s_i, the inversion count for i would be the count of j > i where x_i (based on s_i) > x_j (based on their own s_j) plus the minimal inversion count from i+1 to n (since j > i includes i+1 and beyond). But the x_j's are determined by the choices made for j, which are part of the DP.

Wait, but when we process i in reverse order, the choices for j > i are already fixed. So when we compute DP[i][s_i], the inversion count for j > i is already accounted for in the data structure. So perhaps:

DP[i][s_i] = count + DP[i+1][best_s_i+1]

But how?

Alternatively, for each i, the DP[i][s] is the minimal number of inversions from i to n, given that we choose s (flip or not) for i. Then, to compute this, when we choose s for i, the inversion count added is the number of j > i where x_i (s) > x_j (their chosen s_j). Then, plus the minimal DP[i+1][s_j], since for j > i, they have already been processed and their DP is computed.

Wait, perhaps the DP[i][s] is the count of inversions between i and j > i (based on i's choice s and j's choices) plus the minimal DP[i+1][...].

But j's choices are already made and stored in the data structure. So when we process i, the data structure contains all x_j for j > i (their optimal choice), and thus the count for i's choice is fixed. Then, the DP[i][s] is the count (how many j > i have x_j < x_i) plus the minimal DP[i+1][s'] for s' in 0 and 1.

Wait, no. Because the DP[i][s] represents the inversions from i to n, including those between i and j > i, as well as the inversions among j > i. But the inversions among j > i are already accounted for in the DP[i+1][...], which is the minimal possible inversion count from i+1 to n.

Therefore, the correct recurrence is:

DP[i][s] = count_of_j_>i_where_x_j < x_i_s + DP[i+1][s_i+1]

But s_i+1 is not part of the recurrence. Wait, perhaps the DP[i+1] is the minimal between the two possible choices for i+1. Because when processing i+1, the optimal choice (flip or not) is chosen to minimize the total inversion count. So for the current i, when choosing s_i (flip or not), the inversion count for j > i is the count of j > i where x_j (already chosen optimally) is less than x_i. And then, the total inversion count is this count plus the minimal inversion count for i+1.

But when processing i+1, the DP[i+1] is the minimal inversion count between flipping and not flipping. So, for the current i, the DP[i][s] is the count (number of j>i where x_j < x_i_s) plus the minimal of DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1].

Wait, no. Because the DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1] represent the inversion count from i+1 to n, given that i+1 is flipped or not. But in our current processing, the choices for j > i are already fixed. So, when we process i, the data structure contains all x_j for j > i, which were determined by their optimal choices (flip or not). Therefore, the inversion count contributed by i's choice is the count of j > i where x_i_s > x_j (fixed x_j), and the inversion count from j > i is already the minimal possible (since they were processed in reverse order). 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to model this step by step.

Let's say we have processed i+1, i+2, ..., n. For each of those, the optimal choice (flip or not) has been made, and their x_j values are known. The data structure contains all x_j for j > i. So when processing i, for each possible choice (flip or not), we can calculate how many j > i are such that x_i (choice) > x_j (fixed). This is the number of inversions added between i and j. Then, the total inversion count for this choice is that number plus the minimal inversion count from the elements after i. But what's the inversion count from the elements after i?

Wait, the elements after i are j > i. The inversion count for j > i is already the minimal possible. So for example, when processing i+1, the DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1] represent the minimal inversion counts for i+1 and beyond. So the minimal inversion count for elements j > i is the minimal between DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1]. Therefore, when processing i, the inversion count for choosing to flip or not is the count of j>i inversions plus that minimal value.

Therefore, the recurrence would be:

DP[i][s] = count + min(DP[i+1][0], DP[i+1][1])

But how do we track the data structure of x_j's for j>i?

When processing i, after choosing the optimal flip state (which gives the minimal DP[i][s]), we add the x_i (based on the chosen s) to the data structure. Wait, but how do we choose between the two possible s for i? Because the data structure depends on the choices made for i.

No, the data structure must track all x_j for j>i, which are the optimal choices made for those j. For example, when processing i, the data structure contains x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ..., x_n}, which are the optimal choices for those j (i.e., the choice that gives the minimal inversion count for j and beyond). But when we compute the count for i's choice (flip or not), we are considering the x_j's that were chosen optimally for j>i.

But how do we track which x_j's are chosen? Because for j>i, their optimal choice may vary between flipping or not, depending on what gives the minimal inversion count. So the data structure must contain all x_j's that are chosen when the optimal choice is made for j. 

Yes. So for each j, when processing j, we choose whether to flip or not (s_j), which gives the minimal DP[j][s_j]. The x_j is then either p[j] or -p[j], based on s_j. This x_j is added to the data structure, which is then used for processing i = j-1.

So the process is:

Initialize a data structure (like a sorted list or a Binary Indexed Tree) as empty.

For i from n down to 1:

   For each possible choice s in {0, 1} (not flip, flip):

       x_i_s = p[i] if s == 0 else -p[i]

       count = number of elements in data structure that are less than x_i_s

       inversion_count = count + min(DP[i+1][0], DP[i+1][1]) 

       (assuming DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1] are the minimal inversion counts for i+1)

   Choose the s (0 or 1) for i that gives the minimal inversion_count.

   DP[i][0] = inversion_count for s=0

   DP[i][1] = inversion_count for s=1

   Then, choose the minimal of DP[i][0] and DP[i][1], and add x_i (based on the chosen s) to the data structure.

Wait, but how do we track the x_j's? Because for each j>i, their x_j's are chosen based on their optimal s_j. So when we process i, the data structure contains x_j's for j>i, which are the optimal choices (flip or not) for those j's.

But how are these x_j's stored? Because after processing j, the optimal choice is known (s_j which gives the minimal inversion count), and x_j is added to the data structure. So the data structure is built as we process the elements in reverse order.

So the steps are:

Initialize data_structure as empty.

Initialize DP[n+1] as 0 (since when i =n, after processing, there are no elements left, so the inversion count is 0).

For i from n down to 1:

   For s in 0 and 1:

       x = p[i] if s==0 else -p[i]

       count = data_structure.query_less(x)

       if i ==n:

           current_inversion = count + DP[i+1] (which is 0)

       else:

           current_inversion = count + min(DP[i+1][0], DP[i+1][1])

       store current_inversion for s.

   Choose s_opt (0 or 1) that gives the minimal inversion count. 

   DP[i][0] = inversion_count for s=0

   DP[i][1] = inversion_count for s=1

   x_opt = p[i] if s_opt ==0 else -p[i]

   add x_opt to data_structure.

But wait, no. Because for each i, the DP[i][s] represents the inversion count if we choose s for i. But the choice of s for i affects which x_i is added to the data structure. However, the data structure must contain the x_i's that were chosen optimally for each j>i. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Because when processing i, the data structure contains the x_j's for j>i (processed in previous steps). For each possible choice s for i, the x_i is computed, and the count is the number of x_j's < x_i. Then, the inversion count for s is that count plus the minimal inversion count from j>i (DP[i+1][0] or DP[i+1][1}).

But the data structure for j>i is already built with their x_j's. So for processing i, the data structure is fixed. Then, after choosing the best s for i (based on which gives the minimal inversion count), we add the corresponding x_i to the data structure for use in processing i-1.

Yes. Because after processing i, the data structure includes the x_i's optimal choice, so when processing i-1, j>i-1 includes i, which has been added to the data structure.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize a data structure (sorted list) as empty.

DP is a 2D array where DP[i][0] is the inversion count if we choose not to flip i, DP[i][1] if we choose to flip.

But since we process i in reverse order, from n down to 1, and for each i, we only need DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1}, we can use variables to track the previous DP values.

Wait, when processing i, we need to refer to DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1}. So for i = n, after processing, the data structure will contain x_n's optimal choice. Then, for i =n-1, we compute DP[i][0] and DP[i][1} based on the data structure (which contains x_n), and then add the optimal x_i to the data structure for i-1's processing.

But how to track the minimal inversion count for j>i?

Actually, for each i, the DP[i][s] = count of j>i where x_i (s) > x_j (their optimal choices) + minimal inversion count from j>i.

But the minimal inversion count from j>i is the minimal between DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1} (since i+1 is the next element after i). Wait, no. Because j>i includes all elements from i+1 to n, not just i+1. So the minimal inversion count from j>i is the total inversion count from i+1 to n, which is stored in the DP[i+1][...}, but DP[i+1][...} represents the inversion count from i+1 to n when choosing to flip or not i+1.

Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Because the inversion count from j>i is the sum of inversions between j>i elements (i+1 to n), which is stored in the DP[i+1][...}, but that represents the inversion count when i+1 is processed and their choices are made.

Hmm, perhaps the DP[i][s] should represent the total inversion count from i to n, including the inversions between i and j>i, and the inversions among j>i.

So, for example, when we choose s for i, the inversion count is:

number of j>i where x_i (s) > x_j (their optimal choices) + the inversion count among j>i (which is already computed as the minimal between DP[i+1][0} and DP[i+1][1}).

But j>i includes i+1, i+2, ..., n. The inversion count among them is the DP[i+1][...} (the minimal inversion count from i+1 to n).

So the recurrence is:

DP[i][s] = (count of j>i where x_i (s) > x_j_opt) + min(DP[i+1][0}, DP[i+1][1}).

Then, after choosing the minimal DP[i][s], we add x_i (based on s) to the data structure. 

But wait, no. Because the x_j's for j>i are their optimal choices (based on their own DP[j][s]). But how are these x_j's stored in the data structure?

Ah, here's the missing link. For each j processed after i (since we're processing in reverse), when j is processed, we choose the optimal s_j that minimizes DP[j][s_j}. Then, the x_j corresponding to s_j is added to the data structure. So, for example, after processing j, the data structure contains x_j (the optimal choice), and for processing j-1, the data structure includes all x_k for k >= j.

So, when processing i, the data structure contains all x_j for j > i (processed after i), which are the optimal choices for each j. Therefore, for each i, the count of j>i where x_i (s) > x_j_opt is computed using the data structure. The inversion count from j>i is the minimal inversion count for j>i (which is min(DP[i+1][0}, DP[i+1][1})).

Therefore, the recurrence is correct.

Now, the data structure needs to support two operations: adding a number and querying the number of elements less than a given x. For these operations, a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a segment tree can be used. But since the elements can be large (up to 1e5 in absolute value), we need to compress the coordinates.

But since we're processing elements in reverse order and adding them to the data structure, we can collect all possible x values (p[i] and -p[i} for all i) and compress them into ranks. This way, we can use a Fenwick Tree with compressed coordinates.

So here's the plan:

1. Collect all possible values of x (p[i] and -p[i}) for all i. 

2. Compress these values into ranks (sorted and mapped to unique integers). This allows us to use a Fenwick Tree with ranks instead of the actual values.

3. Process the elements in reverse order (i from n-1 down to 0, assuming 0-based indexing).

4. For each i, compute the two possible x values (p[i], -p[i}).

5. For each possible x, query the data structure to find the number of elements already in the data structure that are less than x. This gives the count of j>i where x_j_opt < x_i_possible.

6. Compute the inversion count for each choice (flip or not) as count + min(DP_prev_0, DP_prev_1), where DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 are the DP values for i+1.

7. Choose the minimal inversion count for the current i, and add the corresponding x value to the data structure.

8. Update the DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 for the current i, to be used in the next iteration (i-1).

Now, implementing this:

But first, coordinate compression. Let's see. For each element in p, we can generate two values: p[i] and -p[i}. Then, collect all these values, sort them, assign unique ranks.

But since the elements can be up to 1e5 in absolute value, this would be 2*2000=4000 elements, so it's manageable.

Once all possible x's are compressed into ranks, the Fenwick Tree can be initialized with the maximum rank.

Now, the steps in code:

Read n.

Read the array p.

Generate all possible x values (p[i] and -p[i} for each i).

Create a sorted list of unique x values, then map each x to its rank.

Initialize a Fenwick Tree with size equal to the number of unique x values.

Initialize DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 for i =n (since after processing i =n, there are no elements left).

But since in the reverse processing, the first element to process is i =n (original last element). Let's assume 0-based indices.

Wait, let's index from 0 to n-1. So for i from n-1 down to 0:

For each i, compute two possible x: p[i] and -p[i}.

For each x, find the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree (which are x_j_opt for j > i) that are less than x.

The inversion count for choosing this x is the count plus the minimal of DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1.

Wait, but DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 represent the DP values for i+1. For example, when processing i, i+1 has already been processed, and DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 are the DP[i+1][0] and DP[i+1][1}.

For the last element (i =n-1), when processing, i+1 =n, which is out of bounds. So DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 would be 0.

So the initial DP_prev_0 and DP_prev_1 are both 0.

Wait, perhaps for i =n-1, after processing, the next i is i-1, which is n-2, etc.

So, for each i, after processing, we set new variables (current_0 and current_1) which are the DP[i][0} and DP[i][1}, then set DP_prev_0 = current_0 and DP_prev_1 = current_1 for the next iteration.

So, the code would be something like:

fenwick_tree = FenwickTree(size_of_compressed)

dp_prev0 = 0

dp_prev1 = 0

for i in reversed(range(n)):

    x0 = p[i]

    x1 = -p[i]

    # query the number of elements < x0 in the current Fenwick Tree

    count0 = fenwick_tree.query(rank_x0 - 1)

    # query the number of elements < x1 in the current Fenwick Tree

    count1 = fenwick_tree.query(rank_x1 - 1)

    # compute the inversion counts

    inv0 = count0 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    inv1 = count1 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    # choose the minimal between the two options

    current0 = inv0

    current1 = inv1

    # now, decide which x to add to the Fenwick Tree.

    # the choice is the one with the minimal inversion count.

    if current0 <= current1:

        chosen_x = x0

        chosen_inv = current0

    else:

        chosen_x = x1

        chosen_inv = current1

    # add chosen_x to the Fenwick Tree

    fenwick_tree.update(rank_chosen_x, 1)

    # update dp_prev0 and dp_prev1 for next iteration

    dp_prev0, dp_prev1 = current0, current1

But wait, no. For each i, after processing, the DP[i][0] and DP[i][1} are inv0 and inv1. But when adding to the Fenwick Tree, we have to choose which x to add based on the optimal choice for i. But how do we know which x is chosen?

Because the Fenwick Tree must contain the x values of the optimal choices for each i. So when processing i, after calculating inv0 and inv1 (the inversion counts for flipping or not), the optimal choice is the one that gives the minimal inversion count. Thus, we add the corresponding x to the Fenwick Tree.

So for example, if inv0 <= inv1, then we choose not to flip i, so x0 is added. Otherwise, x1 is added.

But then, the DP_prev0 and DP_prev1 for the next iteration (i-1) will be inv0 and inv1, but the next iteration's DP_prev0 and DP_prev1 should be the inv0 and inv1 of i, which are the DP[i][0} and DP[i][1} values. But wait, no. Because for the next iteration (i-1), the DP_prev0 and DP_prev1 are the DP[i][0} and DP[i][1} values.

Yes. Because when processing i-1, the j>i-1 includes i. So the optimal choice for i is already made (whether to flip or not), and the x_i is added to the Fenwick Tree.

So, for each i, after processing, we need to set DP_prev0 and DP_prev1 to current0 and current1. But when adding to the Fenwick Tree, we need to add the x corresponding to the minimal of current0 and current1.

Wait, but how is this possible? Because current0 is the inversion count for choosing not to flip i, and current1 is for flipping. But the choice of which x to add to the data structure must be based on which choice (s) gives the minimal inversion count.

So, for each i, after computing current0 and current1, we choose the minimal between them. Then, the x corresponding to the minimal choice is added to the Fenwick Tree, and the DP_prev is set to current0 and current1 (since when processing i-1, the inversion count for j>i-1 is the minimal of current0 and current1).

Wait, no. The DP_prev for i is the inversion count from i to n. But when processing i-1, the inversion count for j>i-1 (which includes i) is the minimal of current0 and current1. So the minimal of current0 and current1 is the inversion count for j >=i.

But when processing i-1, the current0 and current1 of i are stored in DP_prev0 and DP_prev1, which is the inversion count for j >=i. So when processing i-1, the inversion count for j>i-1 is the minimal of DP_prev0 and DP_prev1.

Yes. So the code should be:

For each i in reverse order:

compute current0 and current1 (inv0 and inv1)

then, DP_prev0 and DP_prev1 are set to current0 and current1.

But when adding to the Fenwick Tree, we need to add the x corresponding to the optimal choice for i. That is, if current0 is the minimal of current0 and current1, then we add x0 to the Fenwick Tree. Otherwise, x1 is added.

So the code would be:

for i from n-1 downto 0:

    x0 = p[i]

    x1 = -p[i]

    count0 = fenwick.query(rank_x0)

    count1 = fenwick.query(rank_x1)

    inv0 = count0 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    inv1 = count1 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    current0 = inv0

    current1 = inv1

    if current0 <= current1:

        add x0 to the Fenwick Tree

    else:

        add x1 to the Fenwick Tree

    dp_prev0, dp_prev1 = current0, current1

Wait, but the minimal inversion count for i is min(current0, current1). But the Fenwick Tree must contain the x values of the optimal choices for each j>i. So when processing i, after computing current0 and current1, the optimal choice is the one with the minimal inversion count, so we add the corresponding x to the data structure.

Yes.

But then, when processing i-1, the data structure contains the x values of j >=i, which were chosen optimally.

So the code is correct.

Now, the key is to implement the Fenwick Tree with coordinate compression.

Let's proceed to code.

First, generate all possible x values (p[i] and -p[i} for all i).

Then, create a sorted list of unique x values, and assign a rank to each. For example:

all_x = []

for num in p:

    all_x.append(num)

    all_x.append(-num)

sorted_unique_x = sorted(list(set(all_x)))

rank = {x:i+1 for i, x in enumerate(sorted_unique_x)}  # ranks start from 1.

The size of the Fenwick Tree is len(sorted_unique_x).

Then, for each x in the Fenwick Tree queries and updates, we use the rank.

Now, the Fenwick Tree implementation:

class FenwickTree:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.size = size

        self.tree = [0]*(size+1)

    def update(self, idx, delta):

        while idx <= self.size:

            self.tree[idx] += delta

            idx += idx & -idx

    def query(self, idx):

        res = 0

        while idx >0:

            res += self.tree[idx]

            idx -= idx & -idx

        return res

But wait, the query is for the number of elements less than x. So when we get the rank of x, we need to find the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree with value <= x-1. So for example, if x is mapped to rank r, then query(r-1) gives the count of elements less than x.

Wait, no. For example, if the sorted_unique_x is [a, b, c], and x is b. Then, the elements less than b are only a. So the rank of b is 2. query(2-1) = query(1) which returns the count of elements <= a, which is correct.

Yes.

So for a given x, to find the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree that are less than x, we first find its rank. If x is not in the sorted list (which could happen if we have duplicates?), but since we're using a sorted list of unique x's, any x that is present must be in the list. So the code should work.

Putting it all together:

Read n.

Read p.

Generate all_x = [x, -x for x in p]

sorted_unique_x = sorted(list(set(all_x)))

rank_dict = {x: i+1 for i, x in enumerate(sorted_unique_x)}

size = len(sorted_unique_x)

fenwick = FenwickTree(size)

dp_prev0 = 0

dp_prev1 = 0

for i in reversed(range(n)):

    current_num = p[i]

    x0 = current_num

    x1 = -current_num

    # get ranks for x0 and x1

    rank_x0 = rank_dict[x0]

    rank_x1 = rank_dict[x1]

    # query for elements < x0 and <x1

    count0 = fenwick.query(rank_x0 -1)

    count1 = fenwick.query(rank_x1 -1)

    inv0 = count0 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    inv1 = count1 + min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1)

    # choose which x to add

    if inv0 <= inv1:

        chosen_rank = rank_x0

        current0 = inv0

        current1 = inv1

    else:

        chosen_rank = rank_x1

        current0 = inv0

        current1 = inv1

    # update the Fenwick Tree

    fenwick.update(chosen_rank, 1)

    # update dp_prev for next iteration

    dp_prev0, dp_prev1 = current0, current1

# the answer is the minimal between dp_prev0 and dp_prev1 after processing all elements

print(min(dp_prev0, dp_prev1))

But wait, after processing all elements (i from n-1 downto 0), the dp_prev0 and dp_prev1 are the DP[0][0} and DP[0][1} values, which represent the inversion counts when the first element (i=0) is flipped or not. So the minimal between them is the answer.

Yes.
