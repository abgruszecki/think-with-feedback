Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand what's going on here.

The problem is about finding all good integers x where the number of valid permutations for Yuzu is not divisible by a prime p. The permutations are valid if Yuzu can defeat all enemies in order, gaining a candy after each victory. So, for each x, f(x) is the count of permutations where she can win all duels. We have to find all x where f(x) mod p is not zero.

First, let's think about how f(x) is calculated. For a permutation P to be valid, Yuzu's candy count after each duel must be at least the enemy's in that step. Let's model this.

Initially, she has x candies. For each step i in the permutation, when fighting enemy P_i, she must have x + (number of previous wins) >= a[P_i]. Because each win gives her +1 candy. Wait, yes. Because after each duel, if she wins, she gains 1 candy. So after the first duel, if she wins, her candies are x+1. After the second, x+2, and so on.

But the order of enemies determines the required x. Let's think: in the permutation order, the enemy at position i (0-based or 1-based? The problem says "after that, she will do n duels" in the order P_1 to P_n? Wait, the permutation P is an array of the enemies in the order she fights them. So for each i from 1 to n, she fights P_i. So the steps are 1-based.

At step i (after i-1 duels), she has x + (i-1) candies. Because each of the first i-1 wins adds 1. Wait, no. Wait, before the first duel, she has x. If she wins the first duel (P_1), she gains 1 candy, making x+1. Then the second duel (P_2), she has x+1 before the fight. If she wins, she gains another, etc. So after i-1 duels (before the ith duel), she has x + (i-1) candies. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Each duel, if she wins, she gets 1 candy. The problem says, "the candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels." So when she fights enemy P_i (the i-th in the permutation), the check is whether her current candies >= a[P_i]. If yes, she wins, gains 1 candy (to be used in the next duels). So:

At the start, she has x candies.

For the first duel (i=1 in permutation order):

She has x >= a[P_1] → if yes, she gains 1, now x+1.

For the second duel (i=2):

She has x+1 (from previous wins) >= a[P_2] → if yes, gain 1 → x+2.

So after each duel, the total candies increase by 1 each time she wins. So for the i-th duel (in permutation order), the required condition is:

x + (number of previous wins) >= a[P_i]. But since she has to win all duels, the number of previous wins is i-1. So for the i-th duel, she must have x + (i-1) >= a[P_i]. Because she has already won the first i-1 duels (since the permutation is valid), so after each of those, she gained 1. So before the i-th duel, her candies are x + (i-1).

Wait, wait. Let's see: the i-th duel is the (i)th in the permutation. To fight the i-th enemy in permutation P, she must have already won the first i-1 duels. So after those i-1 duels, she has x + (i-1) candies. So before the i-th duel, she has x + (i-1) candies. But the i-th duel requires that she has >= a[P_i], and if she wins, she gains 1, making x + i.

So the condition for the i-th duel is x + (i-1) >= a[P_i].

Therefore, for the entire permutation to be valid, all enemies in the permutation must satisfy a[P_i] <= x + (i-1) - 1? Wait, no: the i-th duel (step i) is when she has x + (i-1) candies. So the condition for that step is x + (i-1) >= a[P_i].

So for each P_i in the permutation, the position i in the permutation (from 1 to n) must satisfy a[P_i] <= x + (i-1). Because when fighting enemy P_i at position i, she has x + (i-1) candies.

So the problem reduces to: the permutation P is valid if and only if, for all 1 <= i <= n, a[P_i] <= x + (i-1).

Therefore, the value of f(x) is the number of permutations of the enemies where each enemy's a_i is <= x + (i-1 - 1)? Wait, no. Wait, the permutation P is ordered such that for each position i (starting from 1 to n), the enemy at that position in P has a value <= x + (i-1).

So, to count the number of valid permutations, we need to arrange the enemies in some order where for each i, the a value of the i-th enemy in the permutation is <= x + (i-1).

But how do we compute this?

Let me think. For each x, the maximum allowed a_i for position i in the permutation is x + (i-1). Let's call this value s_i(x) = x + i - 1.

So for each enemy, the positions in which they can appear in the permutation are those i where a_enemy <= s_i(x) = x + i - 1.

Wait, but in the permutation, each enemy is placed exactly once. So, the problem is equivalent to arranging all the a_i's such that each a_i is placed in a position j where a_i <= s_j(x) = x + j - 1.

The number of such permutations is the product of the counts of available choices at each step. Wait, but how?

Let's sort the a_i's in non-decreasing order. Let's think about the greedy approach. For the earliest possible positions, the required s_j(x) is x + j -1, which increases with j. So for each a_i, the earliest position it can be placed is when s_j(x) >= a_i. The number of positions available for each a_i depends on the order in which we choose them.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to sort the a array in non-decreasing order. Then, for each a_i, the number of positions j where j <= (x + j -1 >= a_i). Wait, that's not straightforward. Let me see.

Suppose we sort the a array in non-decreasing order. Then, for each a_i, the earliest position j where a_i <= x + j -1. Let's solve for j: j >= a_i -x +1. But j can't be larger than n.

Wait, for a given a_i, the positions j in which it can be placed are those j where x + j-1 >= a_i → j >= a_i -x +1. But j must be between 1 and n.

So for each a_i, the number of positions j available is max(0, n - (ceil( (a_i -x) )) +1 ). Wait, perhaps not. Let's rework:

x + j -1 >= a_i → j >= (a_i -x) +1.

But j must be at least 1. So the minimum j that satisfies this is j_min = max(1, a_i -x +1). The maximum j is n.

So the number of positions available for a_i is max(0, n - j_min + 1) if j_min <=n.

But if j_min >n, then the number of positions is 0.

But if we sort the a's in increasing order, perhaps we can model the available positions in a way that the total number of permutations is the product of (k_i - (i-1)), where k_i is the number of a's <= s_i(x) and sorted.

Wait, here's a standard approach for counting permutations that satisfy certain constraints. Suppose we sort the a's in non-decreasing order. Then, for each a_j in the sorted list, we compute how many positions are available for it, considering that we have to place all a's and each a must fit into a certain position.

But since the permutation must arrange all the a's, each in a position where a_i <= x + j-1 (where j is their position in the permutation), the count is possible only if for all i, the sorted a's a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n, and for each a_i in the sorted list, a_i <= x + (i-1).

Wait, no. Because when you sort the a's in non-decreasing order, and then check if each a_i <= x + (i-1), then the number of valid permutations is the product of (the number of choices at each step). For example, the first a (smallest) can be placed in any position j where j >= (a_i -x +1). Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the correct approach is to sort the a's in increasing order and then check that each a_i <= x + (i-1). If this is true, then the number of permutations is the product of (the number of choices for each a_i when placed in order), which is the product of (k_i - (i-1)), where k_i is the number of a's <= x + (i-1) after sorting.

Wait, here's a standard approach in such permutation counting problems. Let's sort the a's in non-decreasing order. For a permutation to be valid, the i-th enemy in the sorted array must be <= x + (i-1). Because if in the sorted array, a_i is larger than x + (i-1), then there's no way to arrange the enemies. Because even the i-th smallest a is too big for the i-th position in the permutation.

Wait, perhaps this is the key. Let's sort the a's in non-decreasing order. Then, for the permutation to be possible, the sorted a must satisfy a_i <= x + (i-1) for all i. If this is not the case, then there's no valid permutation, so f(x) is zero. Otherwise, the number of valid permutations is the product for each i from 1 to n of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the number of a_j <= x + (i-1).

Wait, let me think. For each position in the permutation (1-based), the maximum allowed a_j is x + (i-1). So after sorting the a's, if a_1 <= x+0 (since position 1 requires a <=x), a_2 <= x+1 (position 2 requires a <=x+1-1 =x+0?), wait, no.

Wait, position i (i-th step in permutation) requires a_P_i <= x + (i-1). So for the sorted array a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n, the necessary condition is that for each j from 1 to n, a_j <= x + (j-1). Because the j-th smallest a must be <= x + (j-1). Otherwise, even if you arrange the permutation in sorted order, there's a j-th element that's too big for the j-th position in the permutation. Thus, there's no valid permutation.

But if that condition is met, then the number of valid permutations is the product for each i from 1 to n of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the number of a's <= x + (i-1). Because when you sort the a's in non-decreasing order, for the i-th position in the permutation (which allows a up to x + (i-1)), the number of choices for the i-th position is (number of a's <= x + (i-1)) minus the number of a's already chosen in the previous positions.

Wait, here's how it works. Let's sort the a's in non-decreasing order. For the first position in the permutation (i=1), the allowed a's are those <= x. So the count is the number of a's <= x. Let's call this c_1. Then, for the second position (i=2), allowed a's are those <= x+1 (since x +1-1 =x). Wait, no: for position i=2, the condition is x + (2-1) =x+1. So allowed a's are those <=x+1. But since we have already chosen one a for the first position, the available count for the second position is (number of a's <=x+1) - 1. But this is only if the a's are sorted.

Wait, no. Because when sorted, a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n. So for the first position, the a's that can be placed there are those <=x. Let's say there are k_1 such a's. So for the first position, we have k_1 choices. Then, for the second position, the a's must be <=x+1. But since we already selected one a for the first position (which was <=x), the remaining a's that can be used for the second position are those <=x+1, minus the one already used. But the sorted array has a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_k1 <= x <= a_{k1+1} ... So, the second position can choose any of the remaining (k_2 -1) a's, where k_2 is the number of a's <=x+1. But k_2 must be >=2, since a_2 <=x+1 (because the sorted a's have a_1 <=x, a_2 <=x+1, etc.).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Sort the array a in non-decreasing order.
2. For each i (1-based), check if a[i] > x + (i-1). If any such i exists, then f(x) is 0.
3. Otherwise, f(x) is the product of (b_i) where b_i is (number of a_j <=x + (i-1)) - (i-1). Because for the i-th position, we have to choose an a_j that's <=x + (i-1), and after selecting i-1 a's in the previous positions, we have (c_i) - (i-1) choices left, where c_i is the count of a_j <=x + (i-1).

So, the product would be the product for i from 1 to n of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the number of a_j <= x + (i-1). But how is this derived?

Let's see. For example, in the first sample input:

3 2

3 4 5

When x=3:

sorted a is [3,4,5].

Check for each i:

i=1: a[1-1] (assuming 0-based) is 3 <=3 +0 → yes.

i=2: a[1] =4 <=3+1=4 → yes.

i=3: a[2]=5 <=3+2=5 → yes.

So all conditions are satisfied. Now, compute the product:

For i=1: number of a_j <=3+0=3 → which is 1 (only 3). So (1) -0=1.

i=2: a_j <=3+1=4. There are 2 (3 and 4). (2) -1=1.

i=3: a_j <=3+2=5. All 3. (3) -2=1.

Product is 1*1*1=1, which matches the sample.

When x=4:

sorted a is [3,4,5].

Check each i:

3 <=4+0=4 → yes.

4<=4+1=5 → yes.

5<=4+2=6 → yes.

Now compute the product:

i=1: a_j <=4 → 2 (3,4). (2-0) =2.

i=2: a_j <=5 →3. (3-1) =2.

i=3: a_j <=6 →3. (3-2) =1.

Product is 2*2*1=4. Which is the sample's f(4)=4. Wait, but in the sample explanation, x=4 has f(x)=4. So this approach gives 4, which is correct.

But according to the sample explanation, for x=5, all 6 permutations are valid. Let's check:

sorted a is [3,4,5].

For each i:

3 <=5+0=5 → yes.

4 <=5+1=6 → yes.

5 <=5+2=7 → yes.

Compute product:

i=1: a_j <=5 →3. (3-0)=3.

i=2: a_j <=6 →3. (3-1)=2.

i=3: a_j <=7 →3. (3-2)=1.

Product is 3*2*1=6, which is 3! =6. So yes, correct.

So this approach works. So f(x) is the product of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the number of elements <= x + (i-1) after sorting the a array. And the necessary condition is that for all i, a_i (sorted) <=x + (i-1). If this is not satisfied, f(x) is 0.

So the steps to compute f(x) are:

1. Sort the a array in non-decreasing order.

2. For each x, compute for each i (1-based) the value s_i =x + (i-1).

3. Check if the sorted a[i-1] (since 0-based) is <= s_i. If any a[i-1] > s_i, then f(x) is 0.

4. Otherwise, compute the product of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the count of elements in a that are <= s_i. Since the array is sorted, for each s_i, c_i can be found via binary search.

Now, the problem requires us to find all x where f(x) is not divisible by p. So for each x, compute f(x) mod p, and check if it's non-zero.

But the constraints are n up to 2000, and x can be up to a_i up to 2000. But how do we find all possible x's that are good?

Wait, but what's the possible x's that can result in a valid permutation (f(x) >0)?

The x must be such that all a_i (sorted) <= x + i-1 for each i. So the minimum x required is x >= a_i - (i-1) for each i. The minimal x is max( a_i - (i-1) for all i ), but if a_i - (i-1) <=0, then x can be 1.

Wait, let's see. For each i (after sorting), the condition is x >= a_i - (i-1). Because a_i <= x + (i-1) → x >= a_i - (i-1).

So x must be >= max( a_1 -0, a_2 -1, a_3 -2, ..., a_n - (n-1) ).

But a_i can be larger than (i-1), so x must be at least that maximum value. Let's call this minimal x as x_min. Then, for x >=x_min, the sorted a array will satisfy a_i <=x + (i-1) for all i. So for x >=x_min, f(x) is the product, and for x <x_min, f(x) is 0.

But wait, in the first sample, the sorted a is [3,4,5]. The x_min is max(3-0=3, 4-1=3,5-2=3) →3. So x must be >=3. For x=3, the product is 1, which is 1. For x=4, the product is 2*2*1=4, etc.

So for x >=x_min, the product is non-zero, and for x <x_min, it's zero. So the possible x's that can contribute to a non-zero f(x) are x >=x_min.

But in the sample input, x=3 is the only good x. For x=3, f(x)=1, which is not divisible by p=2. For x=4, f(x)=4, which is divisible by 2. For x=5 and above, f(x)=6, which is 0 mod 2. So only x=3 is good.

So the problem reduces to:

- For all x where x >=x_min, compute the product (c_i - (i-1)) for i=1..n, and check if this product is not divisible by p.

But since x can be up to a large number (since a_i can be up to 2000, and x_min can be up to 2000 + (n-1)), but the sample outputs have x ranges that are up to 1e5. Wait, the problem's output note says that the number of good x's is guaranteed to be <=1e5. So we need an efficient way to compute for all x >=x_min, whether the product mod p is non-zero.

But for n up to 2000, and x can be up to ... let's see. The x_min is max(a_i - (i-1) for all i). The maximum a_i is 2000, and i can be up to 2000. So (i-1) can be up to 1999. So a_i - (i-1) can be as high as 2000 -0 =2000 (if i=1, a_1 is 2000). So x_min can be up to 2000. For x >=x_min, the product is the product of (c_i - (i-1)).

But how do these terms change as x increases?

Wait, the terms (c_i - (i-1)) are dependent on x. For each x, c_i is the count of a_j <=x + (i-1). Since the array is sorted, for a given x, x + (i-1) is s_i =x +i-1.

So for each i, c_i is the number of elements in a that are <= s_i. Since a is sorted, this can be found using binary search for s_i in a.

But when x increases, s_i increases by 1 for each x. So for x and x+1, s_i for x is x +i-1, and for x+1 it is (x+1) +i-1 =x +i. So s_i increases by 1. So when x increases by 1, each s_i increases by 1.

But how does this affect c_i? For each i, as x increases, s_i increases, so the count c_i (number of elements <=s_i) can increase or stay the same.

But since a is sorted, for each i, as x increases, s_i increases, so c_i is non-decreasing.

But the problem is to compute for x >=x_min, the product of (c_i - (i-1)) mod p, and check if it's non-zero.

But how does the product vary as x increases? Let's see.

For each x, the product is the product over i of (c_i(x) - (i-1)).

But c_i(x) is the number of a_j <= x +i-1.

Let’s consider how x can affect c_i(x). For each x, the product can change only when x +i-1 crosses some a_j. So the product can change when x reaches a value that makes x +i-1 equal to some a_j. But with n up to 2000, there are O(n^2) possible transitions? Not sure.

But for x >=x_min, the product is a certain function. Let's think of the possible x's as starting at x_min and increasing to some x_max, beyond which the product becomes a certain value and remains the same.

Wait, for x large enough, all s_i =x +i-1 are larger than all a_j. So for x >= (max(a_j) - (i-1) for all i) → but for all i, x +i-1 >= a_n (the largest a_j). So when x is >= (a_n - (n-1)), then all a_j are <=x +i-1 for all i. So in this case, c_i =n for all i. So the product is product_{i=1 to n} (n - (i-1)) = product_{k=0 to n-1} (n -k) ) = n! So for x >=x_max = a_n - (n-1), the product is n! which is 0 mod p if p <=n (since p is a prime <=n and n! includes p as a factor). So for x >=x_max, f(x) mod p is zero. So in this case, x_max is the maximum x where the product changes. So for x >=x_max, the product is n! which is divisible by p (since p is <=n). So those x's are not good.

Therefore, the possible x's that need to be checked are in the range x_min <=x <x_max.

But x_min can be up to 2000, and x_max can be up to (2000 +2000-1) =3999? Because a_n is up to 2000, and x_max is a_n - (n-1). For example, if a_n is 2000 and n=2000, then x_max =2000 -1999=1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, x_max is the minimal x such that x +i-1 >=a_n for all i. Wait, for x_max, x_max +n-1 >=a_n. Because for i=n, x_max +n-1 >=a_n. So x_max >=a_n - (n-1). For x >=x_max, the largest a_j (a_n) is <=x_max +n-1. But for i=1, x_max +0 =x_max. But a_1 <=x_max +0? Because x_min is the maximum of a_i - (i-1). So for x >=x_min, a_i <=x +i-1 for all i. Including for i=1. So x_max is not relevant here. Wait, perhaps x_max is not needed. Because x_min ensures that all a_i <=x +i-1. So for x >=x_min, all a_i are <=x +i-1, so the product is valid. So the product can be computed for x >=x_min.

But how does the product change as x increases beyond x_min?

Let's take an example. Suppose a sorted array is [3,4,5], n=3. x_min is 3. For x=3:

s_i for i=1:3+0=3 → c_i=1 → 1-0=1.

i=2:3+1=4 →c_i=2 →2-1=1.

i=3:3+2=5 →c_i=3 →3-2=1.

Product 1.

For x=4:

i=1:4+0=4 →c_i=2 →2-0=2.

i=2:4+1=5 →c_i=3 →3-1=2.

i=3:4+2=6 →c_i=3 →3-2=1.

Product 2*2*1=4.

For x=5:

i=1:5+0=5 →c_i=3 →3-0=3.

i=2:5+1=6 →c_i=3 →3-1=2.

i=3:5+2=7 →c_i=3 →3-2=1.

Product 3*2*1=6.

So for x >=5, the product would be 3*3*3-...? Wait, no. Wait, when x is 5, the s_i's are 5,6,7. The a array is [3,4,5]. So for x=5, s_1=5, so c_1=3 (all elements are <=5). So for x=5, the product is 3 (for i=1) * (3-1) (i=2) * (3-2) (i=3) →3*2*1=6.

If x increases further, say x=6:

s_i for i=1:6 →c_i=3.

i=2:6+1=7 →c_i=3.

i=3:6+2=8 →c_i=3.

So the product is 3 * (3-1) * (3-2) →3*2*1=6.

Which is the same as when x=5. So for x >=5, the product remains 6. Because even though x increases, the s_i for i=1 is x, which is >=5. So all a's are <=x. So for x >=5, the product is n! (3! =6). So for x >=x_max=5 - (3-1) =3? Wait, no. x_max is a_n - (n-1) =5 -2=3. So x >=3. But for x >=5, the product is 6, which is 3!.

Wait, perhaps after a certain x, the product becomes n! and remains that way. That x is when x +i-1 >=a_n for all i. Because for the last i (i=n), x +n-1 >=a_n →x >=a_n - (n-1). So for x >=x_max =a_n - (n-1), the product is n!.

But wait, for x >=x_max:

i ranges from 1 to n. For each i, x +i-1 >=a_n. But since the array is sorted, a_n is the largest. So for x >=x_max, all a_j <=x +i-1 for all i. So c_i for each i is n. So the product becomes product (n - (i-1)) for i=1..n. Which is n * (n-1) * ... *1 =n!.

So for x >=x_max, the product is n!.

But since the problem states that p is a prime <=n, then n! is divisible by p. So for x >=x_max, the product is divisible by p, hence not good. So those x's are not part of the answer.

Thus, the possible x's that can be good are those in the interval [x_min, x_max-1]. Because for x >=x_max, the product is n! → divisible by p.

So the x_max is a_n - (n-1). So the x_max is the minimal x where x +n-1 >=a_n →x >=a_n - (n-1). So x_max is the minimal x where this holds. So for x >=x_max, the product becomes n!.

So the x's that need to be considered are x >=x_min and x <x_max. Because x_max can be up to (a_n - (n-1)). If a_n is 2000 and n is 2000, then x_max is 2000 -1999=1. But x_min can be higher than x_max. For example, if a array sorted is [3,4,5], and n=3, x_min is 3. x_max is 5 -2=3. So x >=x_max is x >=3. But x_min is also 3. So in this case, x_max is 3. So for x >=3, product is 3! =6, which is divisible by p=2.

But the first sample's x_min is 3, x_max is 3. So the only x in the interval [x_min, x_max-1] is x <3, but x_min is 3. So no x exists. But in reality, for x=3, x >=x_max (3>=3), so product is 3! =6. But the sample's first input has x=3 as good. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-calculate x_max.

x_max is the minimal x where x +n-1 >= a_n. So x_max = max(a_n - (n-1), 0) ? Because x must be positive.

Wait, let's take the first sample's a array: [3,4,5], n=3. a_n is 5. x_max is 5 - (3-1) =5-2=3. So x >=3 →x=3,4,5, etc.

For x >=3, the product is n! =6. But in the first sample, when x=3, the product is 1, not 6. So this contradicts the previous reasoning.

Ah, so my mistake here is that x_max is not defined correctly. Because x_max is the minimal x where x +i-1 >=a_n for all i? No, no. Wait, the x_max is the minimal x where x +i-1 >=a_i for all i. But no, the x_min is the minimal x where a_i <=x +i-1 for all i. So x_min is the maximum of (a_i - (i-1)) for all i. So x_min is the minimal x that satisfies all the conditions. So for x >=x_min, all a_i <=x +i-1. So for x >=x_min, the product is computed as the product of (c_i - (i-1)), where c_i is the number of a_j <=x +i-1.

But in the first sample, when x=3, the product is 1*1*1=1, which is not n! (3!=6). So why?

Because when x=3, x_max (a_n - (n-1)) is 5-2=3. But for i=1, x+i-1=3, which is >=a_1=3. For i=2, x+i-1=3+1=4 >=a_2=4. For i=3, x+i-1=3+2=5 >=a_3=5. So all conditions are satisfied, but the product is 1*1*1=1. So my previous assumption that for x >=x_max, the product is n! is incorrect. So what's wrong here?

Ah, I see. The x_max I was thinking about is the minimal x where x +n-1 >=a_n. But that's not sufficient for all i. For example, in x=3, a_3 is 5, and x+n-1=3+2=5. So for i=3, x+i-1=5. But for i=1, x+i-1=3. So in this case, the a_j's are all <=x+i-1 for each i, but the product is not n!.

So my previous reasoning was wrong.

So the product is n! only when x is large enough that for each i, x +i-1 >=a_n. Because in this case, all a_j's are <=x+i-1. So for each i, c_i is n. Then the product is product (n - (i-1)) →n*(n-1)*...*1 =n!.

But in the first sample, x=5: x+i-1 for i=1 is 5, which is >=5 (a_n). For i=2, x+i-1=6 >=5. So all a_j's are <=5,4,5 <=5,6,7. So c_i for i=1 is 3 (all a_j's <=5), for i=2, 3 (all a_j's <=6), etc. So the product is 3*2*1=6=3!.

So for x such that x+i-1 >=a_n for all i, then the product becomes n!.

But how to find such x?

For x to satisfy x +i-1 >=a_n for all i from 1 to n.

The minimal x that satisfies this is when x +0 >=a_n →x >=a_n. Because for i=1, x >=a_n. Then for other i, x +i-1 >=a_n →since x >=a_n and i-1 >=0, x +i-1 >=a_n +i-1 >=a_n (since i-1 >=0). So the minimal x is a_n.

Wait, for x >=a_n, then x +i-1 >=a_n for all i. Because x >=a_n, so x +i-1 >=a_n + (i-1) >=a_n (since i-1 >=0). So yes, for x >=a_n, x+i-1 >=a_n. So for x >=a_n, all a_j's are <=a_n <=x+i-1. So c_i for each i is n. Thus, the product is n!.

So, for x >=a_n, the product is n!.

So in this case, for x >=a_n, f(x) is n!.

So in the first sample, a_n is 5. So x >=5. For x=5, f(x)=3! =6. So for x>=5, the product is 6, which is divisible by 2. So those x's are not good.

Thus, the possible x's that can be good are in the interval x_min <=x <a_n.

But x_min is the maximum of a_i - (i-1) over all i. For example, in the first sample, x_min is 3, a_n is5. So x ranges from 3 to 4.

For x=3: product is 1 →mod 2 is 1 → good.

For x=4: product is4 →mod2 is0 → not good.

So x=3 is the only good x.

So the x's to consider are x >=x_min and x <a_n.

But what if a_n is very small? For example, if a_n is 5 and n=3. Then x >=x_min and x <5.

But x_min could be larger than a_n. For example, suppose a = [10, 10, 10], n=3. x_min is max(10-0=10,10-1=9,10-2=8) →10. a_n is10. So x must be >=10 and <10 → no x exists. So in this case, there's no x where the product is non-zero. So f(x) is zero for all x. So no good x's.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the array a in non-decreasing order.

2. Compute x_min as the maximum of a_i - (i-1) for all i (1-based indices after sorting). If x_min is <=0, then the minimal x is 1, but x must be >=x_min. So x_min is max(x_min, 1).

3. Compute x_start as x_min, x_end as a_n -1.

4. All x in [x_start, x_end] are candidates. For each x in this range, compute the product of (c_i - (i-1)), mod p, and check if it's not zero.

But for n up to 2000, and x_end -x_start up to 2000, this could be manageable. But the problem says that the number of good x's can be up to 1e5, but the code must handle that. So the code must process all x in the range [x_min, a_n-1], and for each x compute the product mod p, and collect the x's where the product is not zero mod p.

But for each x, how to compute the product efficiently?

The approach is:

For each x in the candidate range:

- For each i from 1 to n, compute s_i =x +i-1.

- Check if a[i-1] >s_i → if any, then f(x) is 0.

- Else, compute the product of (c_i - (i-1)) mod p.

But even for n=2000 and x candidates up to 2000 (like in the first sample), 2000 * 2000 =4 million operations. Which is acceptable within 1 second.

But wait, the x candidates could be up to (a_n -1) which can be up to 2000 -1=1999. So for n=2000, 2000 * 2000 =4 million steps. But if x_start is 1 and x_end is 2000-1=1999, then 1999 x's, each requiring 2000 steps → 1999 *2000=3,998,000 steps. Which is manageable.

But how to compute c_i for each x and i?

The array a is sorted. For each x, and for each i, compute s_i =x +i-1. Then, c_i is the number of elements in a that are <=s_i. Since a is sorted, for each s_i, we can perform a binary search to find the rightmost element <=s_i. The count is the index of that element +1 (since arrays are 0-based).

So for each x, and for each i, the binary search would take O(log n) time. For 2000 x's and 2000 i's, this would be 2000 *2000 * log 2000 = approx 2000^2 *11 =44 million operations. Which may be tight for Python in 1 second.

But perhaps we can precompute for all possible s values the c_i. But since s_i can be up to (x_max +i-1). x_max is up to a_n-1, which is up to 2000. So i can be up to 2000, so s_i can be up to (2000) +2000-1=3999. So possible s values are up to 3999. For each possible s in 1..3999, precompute the count of a_j <=s. Then, for any x, and i, s_i =x +i-1. So the count c_i is the precomputed count for s_i.

Yes. So precompute an array cnt where cnt[s] is the number of elements in a that are <=s. Then for any x and i, s_i =x +i-1, and c_i is cnt[s_i], but if s_i exceeds the maximum a_j, then it's n.

But the maximum s_i is x +i-1. x can be up to a_n-1 (2000-1=1999), and i up to 2000. So s_i can be up to 1999 +2000-1=3998. So precompute cnt up to 3998.

But a is sorted. So for all s from 0 to max_s (like 4000), we can compute cnt[s] as the upper_bound of s in a.

So precompute a list of cnt for all possible s up to 4000. Then, for each x and i, s_i can be computed and cnt[s_i] is obtained in O(1) time.

This precomputing step would take O(max_s) time, which is manageable since max_s is 4000. Then, for each x and i, the c_i is cnt[x+i-1].

So the steps for the code are:

1. Read n, p, and the array a.

2. Sort a in non-decreasing order.

3. Compute x_min as the maximum of (a[i] -i) for i in 0..n-1. Because the sorted array is 0-based, so for the (i+1)-th element (since i starts from 0), the condition is a[i] <=x +i (since i starts from 0). Wait, let me recheck:

Original condition for the i-th (1-based) element: a[i-1] (sorted) <=x + (i-1).

So for the 0-based sorted array, the j-th element (0-based) is a[j], which is the (j+1)-th element in the 1-based sorted array.

So for j in 0..n-1 (0-based), the condition is a[j] <=x +j.

Thus, x >= a[j] -j.

So x_min is the maximum of (a[j] -j) for all j in 0..n-1.

Also, x must be >=1.

So x_min = max( max(a[j] -j for j in 0..n-1), 1 )

If x_min is <=0, then x starts from 1.

4. Compute x_end = a[-1] -1. Because for x >=a[-1], the product becomes n! which is divisible by p (since p <=n). So x_end is a[-1] -1.

5. Now, if x_min >x_end → then there are no x's to check, output 0.

Else, proceed.

6. Precompute the cnt array. For each possible s, compute the number of a_j <=s.

For example, since a is sorted, for any s, cnt[s] is the upper_bound index. We can precompute this for all s from 0 to max_possible_s (which is x_end +n-1 →x_end is up to 2000-1=1999, plus n-1=1999 →max_possible_s is 3998).

But for s up to 4000, precompute cnt[s] as the number of a_j <=s.

This can be done using binary search for each s. But for s up to 4000, and n up to 2000, this is manageable.

Alternatively, since the array is sorted, we can iterate through the array and precompute a prefix array where each entry s is the maximum a_j <=s. For example, for all s in 0..max_s, we can compute how many elements in a are <=s. This can be done efficiently.

Alternatively, for each s, the count is the number of elements in a less than or equal to s, which can be found using bisect_right.

But in Python, using the bisect module's bisect_right function.

But for s up to 4000, looping through each s from 0 to 4000 and calling bisect.bisect_right(a, s) would be O(4000 * log n), which is acceptable.

Once this cnt array is precomputed, for any x and i, s_i =x +i-1 (since i starts from 1, j from 0 to n-1 →i-1 is 0-based). So for i from 1 to n (0-based j=0 to j=n-1), s_i =x + (i-1) → where i ranges from 1 to n.

Wait, for the i-th position in the permutation (1-based), the required condition is a[j] (sorted) <=x + (i-1). So for each j from 0 to n-1 (sorted a), the condition for the i-th position is a[j] <=x + (i-1).

But to compute the product, for each position i (1-based), the c_i is the number of a_j <=x + (i-1). So for each i in 1..n, s_i =x + (i-1). So for each x, for each i from 1 to n, compute s_i =x +i-1, then find cnt[s_i].

But the precomputed cnt array is for s up to 4000. So if x +i-1 exceeds 4000, then cnt[s_i] will be the entire array, which is n. So for s_i >= a[-1], cnt[s_i] is n.

But wait, the precomputed cnt array may not go up to s_i. So for s_i greater than the maximum a_j, cnt[s_i] is n.

But how to handle that?

If during precomputation, the maximum s considered is up to the maximum possible s_i, which is x_end +n-1.

But x_end can be up to a[-1]-1. For example, a[-1] is 2000. x_end is 1999. Then, the maximum s_i is 1999 + (n-1). For n=2000, this is 1999+1999=3998. So precomputing cnt up to 4000 should suffice.

Thus, the steps are:

- Precompute cnt[s] for s from 0 to 4000.

Then, for each x in x_min to x_end:

   a. Check if for all j in 0..n-1, a[j] <=x +j → since a is sorted, this is the same as x >=x_min (since x_min is the maximum of a[j]-j). So if x >=x_min, this holds. So we can skip checking, since x is in the range [x_min, x_end], which is >=x_min.

   b. Compute the product of (cnt[x +i-1] - (i-1)) for i from 1 to n. Wait, no. Because for i from 1 to n, s_i =x +i-1. For each i, the count is cnt[s_i], but since the array is sorted, cnt[s_i] is the number of a_j <=s_i.

   So for each i in 1..n, term_i = cnt[s_i] - (i-1). If any term_i is <=0, the product is zero.

   So for the product to be non-zero, all term_i must be positive. Otherwise, the product is zero. But if x >=x_min, then all a_j <=x +j (since x >=x_min →x >= a[j] -j →x +j >=a[j]. So a[j] <=x +j for all j. So for the sorted array, the i-th element (0-based) is a[i], which is <=x +i. But in the permutation, the i-th position (1-based) is x +i-1. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, for the permutation's i-th position (1-based), the condition is a[P_i] <=x + (i-1). But the sorted array a has elements a_0 <=a_1 <= ... <=a_{n-1}.

But for x >=x_min (which is the maximum of a[j] -j for j in 0..n-1), we have x +j >=a[j] for all j. So the j-th element in the sorted array is <=x +j.

But for the i-th position in the permutation (1-based), the required condition is that the element placed there is <=x + (i-1). But when you arrange the elements into the permutation, you can choose any order as long as each element's a_j <=x + (i-1) for the position i it is placed in.

But for the product to be non-zero, all term_i must be positive. But if during the product computation, any term_i is <=0, the product is zero.

But how can term_i be zero or negative when x >=x_min?

Let's take an example. Suppose x=3, sorted a is [3,4,5], n=3.

x_min is max(3-0,4-1,5-2)=3. So x=3.

For i=1, s_i =3+0=3. cnt[3] is 1. term_i =1-0=1.

i=2: s_i=3+1=4. cnt[4] is 2. term_i=2-1=1.

i=3: s_i=3+2=5. cnt[5] is3. term_i=3-2=1.

Product is 1.

But for x=4, a sorted [3,4,5], i=1: s_i=4. cnt=2. term=2-0=2. i=2: s_i=5. cnt=3. term=3-1=2. i=3: s_i=6. cnt=3. term=3-2=1. product is 2*2*1=4.

So the terms are computed correctly.

But suppose x=3, sorted a is [3,5,5]. Then x_min is max(3-0=3,5-1=4,5-2=3) →4. So x must be >=4.

i=1: s_i=4+0=4. cnt[4] is 1 (only 3). term=1-0=1.

But a[0] =3 <=4, but a[1] =5>4. So the product is 1 * ... ?

Wait, no. x_min is 4. So for x=4, the sorted a must satisfy a_j <=x +j for all j. For j=0, x +0=4 >=3. j=1: x+1=5 >=5. j=2: x+2=6 >=5. So conditions are satisfied.

But in permutation's i=1 position (s_i=4), the a's allowed are those <=4. which is only a[0]=3. So term_i=1-0=1.

i=2: s_i=4+1=5. a_j <=5: a[0],a[1],a[2] (3,5,5). So cnt=3. term_i=3-1=2.

i=3: s_i=4+2=6. cnt=3. term_i=3-2=1.

Product is 1*2*1=2.

So mod p=2 is zero. So x=4 is not good.

So the code's steps are:

For each x in x_min to x_end:

   compute the product as follows:

   product = 1

   for i in 1..n:

      s_i =x + i-1

      c_i = cnt[s_i] if s_i <=max_s else n

      term = c_i - (i-1)

      if term <=0:

          product=0

          break

      product = (product * term) % p

   if product %p !=0:

       add x to the answer list.

But this can be optimized by breaking early if any term is zero or negative.

But with this approach, for each x, we can compute the product in O(n) time. And if x ranges up to 2000, this is manageable.

Now, let's code this.

First, precompute the cnt array.

In Python:

import bisect

n, p = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()

x_min = max( (a[j] - j) for j in range(n) )
x_min = max(x_min, 1)

if len(a) ==0:
    x_end =0
else:
    x_end = a[-1] -1

if x_min > x_end:
    print(0)
    exit()

max_s_possible = x_end + (n-1)  # maximum s_i is x_end + n-1
max_s = max(max_s_possible, a[-1] if a else 0)

# Precompute cnt[s] for s from 0 to max_s
max_s_precompute = max_s
cnt = [0]*(max_s_precompute +2)
for s in range(0, max_s_precompute +1):
    cnt[s] = bisect.bisect_right(a, s)

good_x = []

for x in range(x_min, x_end +1):
    product = 1
    valid = True
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        s_i = x + (i-1)
        if s_i > max_s_precompute:
            c_i = n
        else:
            c_i = cnt[s_i]
        term = c_i - (i-1)
        if term <=0:
            valid = False
            break
        product = (product * term) % p
    if valid and product %p !=0:
        good_x.append(x)

print(len(good_x))
print(' '.join(map(str, good_x)))

Wait, but for s_i beyond max_s_precompute, cnt[s_i] is not precomputed. So for example, if x is 2000, and i is 2000, then s_i=2000+1999=3999. But if max_s_precompute is 3999, then it's handled. But in the code, max_s_precompute is set to the maximum of (x_end +n-1, a[-1]).

But x_end is a[-1]-1. So x_end +n-1 = (a[-1]-1) +n-1 = a[-1]+n-2. For a[-1] up to 2000 and n up to 2000, this can be up to 2000+2000-2=3998.

So max_s_possible is 3998, which is covered by the precompute up to 3998.

But the code's max_s_precompute is set to max(max_s_possible, a[-1]). So if a[-1] is larger than max_s_possible (which could be the case when x_end is small), then we need to precompute up to a[-1]. For example, if a[-1] is 3000 and x_end is 2999, then x_end +n-1 is 2999+1999=4998, but a[-1] is 3000, which is larger than 4998? No, 3000>4998 is false. So max_s_precompute is 4998.

So the code's precompute for s up to max_s_precompute = max( x_end +n-1, a[-1] ) is correct.

But in the code, for x in the range x_min to x_end:

   for each i from 1 to n:

       s_i =x +i-1

       if s_i > max_s_precompute → which is x_end +n-1?

But x can be up to x_end, which is a[-1]-1. So x can be 2000-1=1999. i can be up to n=2000. So s_i =1999 +1999=3998. Which is <=max_s_precompute (x_end +n-1= (a[-1]-1)+n-1= (2000-1) +1999=3998). So s_i is within the precomputed cnt array.

Thus, the code's handling of s_i is correct.

But let's test the first sample input.

Sample input 1:

3 2

3 4 5

After sorting, a is [3,4,5].

x_min is max(3-0,4-1,5-2) →3,3,3 →3. x_min=3.

x_end is a[-1]-1 =5-1=4.

max_s_possible =4 +3-1=6. a[-1] is5. So max_s_precompute is6.

precompute cnt[s] for s up to6:

s=0:0

s=1:0

s=2:0

s=3:1 (3)

s=4:2 (3,4)

s=5:3 (3,4,5)

s=6:3.

For x=3:

i=1: s_i=3+0=3 →cnt=1 → term=1-0=1.

i=2:3+1=4 →cnt=2 →2-1=1.

i=3:3+2=5 →cnt=3 →3-2=1.

product=1*1*1=1 mod2=1 →good.

x=4:

i=1:4+0=4 →cnt=2 → term=2-0=2 → mod2=0. product=0 → no.

x=4 is not added.

x=4 is in x_end, but product is 2*2*1=4 mod2=0.

x=5 is not in x_end (x_end=4).

So the code correctly adds x=3.

Sample input 3:

4 3

9 1 1 1

After sorting a is [1,1,1,9].

x_min is computed as:

a[0] -0=1-0=1

a[1] -1=0

a[2] -2= -1

a[3] -3=9-3=6.

so x_min= max(1,0,-1,6) →6. x_min=6.

x_end =a[-1]-1=9-1=8.

precompute s up to x_end +n-1=8+3=11. a[-1] is9. So max_s_precompute is max(11,9) →11.

For x=6:

i=1 →6+0=6. a has elements 1,1,1,9. cnt[6] is3 (elements <=6:3). term=3-0=3. product=3.

i=2 →6+1=7. cnt[7]=3. term=3-1=2. product=3*2=6 mod3=0 → product becomes 0. So valid is False.

So product is 0 → not added.

Similarly, x=6's product is 3*2*1*0 (for i=4, s_i=6+3=9. a[-1] is9. cnt[9]=4. term=4-3=1. But previous term for i=3 is 3-2=1. product is 3*2*1=6 mod3=0. So the product is zero mod3.

Thus, for all x in 6..8, the product is 3*2*1* ... → but after some steps, the product becomes zero.

Hence, the sample output is 0.

So the code handles this.

Thus, the code should work.
