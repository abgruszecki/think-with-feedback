Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the count of numbers between a and b inclusive that have their smallest divisor equal to k. Hmm, let's think about what that means. 

The smallest divisor of a number (other than 1) is the first prime that divides it. But wait, the problem says that the smallest divisor should be exactly k. So that implies that the number is divisible by k, and none of the numbers from 2 to k-1 divide it. Because if there's any divisor less than k, then the smallest divisor would be that, not k. Right.

So the approach is to count all numbers x in [a, b] such that:
1. x is divisible by k.
2. x is not divisible by any number from 2 to k-1.

But wait, there's a catch here. If k itself is not a prime number, then any multiple of k would have a divisor smaller than k (since k has factors other than 1 and itself). For example, if k is 4, then any multiple of 4 (like 8) would have 2 as a divisor. But the smallest divisor of 8 is 2, not 4. So in this case, the answer is zero. So first, we need to check if k is a prime. If not, there can't be any numbers satisfying the condition, because any multiple of k would have a divisor less than k (like the factors of k itself).

Wait, but k could be composite, but maybe in the numbers x, they are multiples of k but k's factors don't divide x. Wait, no. Because if x is a multiple of k, then it's k * m. If k is composite, say k=ab (a and b >1), then x is abm, so x is divisible by a and b, which are both less than k (assuming a and b are >=2). So the smallest divisor of x would be the smallest prime factor of k. Because that factor is a divisor of k, so it's a divisor of x. Therefore, the smallest divisor of x can't be k if k is composite. So the first thing we need to check is: is k a prime? If not, the answer is zero.

So step one: check if k is a prime. If not, output zero.

But wait, how to check if k is a prime? Given that k can be up to 2e9. Oh, that's a problem. Checking primes up to 2e9 is computationally intensive. So the algorithm for checking if k is a prime has to be efficient. Hmm. For that, a deterministic version of the Miller-Rabin test would be needed. Because for numbers up to 2e9, certain bases can be used to test primality deterministically.

Alternatively, since 2e9 is within the range where deterministic checks with certain bases work. For example, according to some references, for numbers less than 2^32, the bases {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37} are sufficient. But maybe for numbers up to 2e9, a smaller set of bases would work.

Alternatively, since 2e9 is less than 2^31, maybe the bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 would suffice. But I need to check what's the correct set for that. Wait, according to some sources, for numbers up to 3,323,393, the bases 2, 3 are sufficient. For up to 2,152,302,898,747, the bases 31, 37, etc. But maybe for numbers up to 2e9, using the first few primes as bases would work. Let me think. The deterministic Miller-Rabin test for numbers up to 2^64 uses certain bases, but for numbers up to 2e9, perhaps the bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 are sufficient. Wait, according to Wikipedia's page on the Miller-Rabin test, for n < 2,152,302,898,747, testing against the bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 is enough. Since 2e9 is less than that, perhaps using these bases would work. So I can implement the Miller-Rabin test with these bases.

So the first step is to check if k is a prime. If not, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.

Once k is a prime, the problem reduces to counting numbers in [a, b] that are multiples of k, and not divisible by any prime less than k. Wait, but wait: the problem states that the numbers should not be divisible by any number between 2 and k-1. Because if any such number divides x, then the smallest divisor of x would be that, not k. So x must be divisible by k, and not divisible by any number in 2 to k-1.

But since k is a prime, any number in 2 to k-1 is either composite or primes smaller than k. So the condition is that x is a multiple of k, and x is coprime with all numbers from 2 to k-1. But since k is a prime, all primes less than k are in that range. So x must be a multiple of k, and x must not be divisible by any primes less than k. Because if x is divisible by any prime p <k, then the smallest divisor is p, not k. So for example, if k is 5, then x must be divisible by 5, and not divisible by 2 or 3. Because 2 and 3 are primes less than 5. So in this case, x must be 5 times a number that is coprime with 2 and 3. So the numbers are 5, 25, 35, 55, etc. But any multiple of 5 that is not even and not divisible by 3.

So the approach is:

1. Check if k is prime. If not, return 0.

2. Then, check if there exists any prime p <k. Because if k is 2, the primes less than 2 are none. Wait, k is 2, the primes less than k are none. So in that case, the condition is that x is even (divisible by 2), and there are no primes less than 2, so the numbers are all even numbers in [a,b]. Because x must be divisible by 2, and not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 1 (which is impossible, so all even numbers satisfy the condition). So for k=2, the answer is the count of even numbers in [a,b]. But wait, the problem says that the smallest divisor is k. So for even numbers, their smallest divisor is 2, which is k. So yes.

So when k is prime, the next step is to check if all the primes less than k do not divide x. But how do we check that? Because for x to not be divisible by any primes less than k, x must be either 1 (but since x is >= a >=1, but x must be >=k, because x is divisible by k, and k >=2) or a prime >=k. Wait, no. For example, k=5. x=5*7=35. 35 is divisible by 5, but not by 2 or 3. So the smallest divisor is 5. So yes. So x can be a composite number, but not divisible by any primes less than k. So x must be a multiple of k, and x must not be divisible by any primes less than k.

So the problem reduces to: count the numbers x in [a, b] such that x is divisible by k, and x is coprime with all primes less than k.

But how do we compute that efficiently?

First, for the case when k is a prime:

We can model the problem as follows: numbers x in [a, b] that are multiples of k, and for all primes p <k, x is not divisible by p.

But considering that checking all primes less than k could be computationally intensive if k is large. For example, if k is 1e6, then the primes less than k could be up to 1e6, which is a lot. So how to handle that?

Wait, but the problem is that the numbers x must not be divisible by any primes less than k. So the numbers x must be multiples of k, and also co-prime with all primes less than k. So the problem can be rephrased as x is a multiple of k, and x is co-prime with the product of all primes less than k. Let's call that product M. So x must be divisible by k, and co-prime with M /k? Wait, no. Because M is the product of primes less than k. Since k is a prime, M is the product of primes less than k. So x must be divisible by k (so x =k * m) and m must not be divisible by any primes less than k (since if m is divisible by p <k, then x is divisible by p, which is less than k, leading to x's smallest divisor being p).

Wait, but x is k * m, and m must be coprime with all primes less than k. Because otherwise, x would be divisible by that prime. So the problem reduces to counting numbers m such that:

- k*m is in [a, b]

- m is coprime with all primes less than k.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if k is a prime. If not, return 0.

2. Compute the product of all primes less than k. Let's call this product P. However, P could be very large. For example, if k is 1e6, then P would be the product of all primes up to 1e6-1, which is a huge number. So storing P directly is not feasible. But perhaps we can represent the primes and compute the coprime condition by checking divisibility by each of them.

3. For each x =k*m in [a, b], we need m to be co-prime with all primes less than k. So m must not be divisible by any of those primes.

So the count is equal to the number of m in [m_start, m_end], where m_start = ceil(a/k), m_end = floor(b/k), such that m is coprime with all primes less than k.

But how to compute the count of m in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with all primes in S (where S is the primes less than k)?

This is similar to the inclusion-exclusion problem, where we want to count numbers not divisible by any primes in a set S.

The inclusion-exclusion approach can be used here. The formula is:

count = total numbers in range - sum of multiples of primes in S + sum of multiples of pairwise products of primes in S - ... etc.

But the problem is that S can be a large set. For example, if k is 1e5, then S has about 10,000 primes (since the number of primes less than 1e5 is ~ 10^4). Inclusion-exclusion would then involve 2^10,000 terms, which is impossible. So this approach is not feasible for large S.

Alternative approach: The numbers m must be coprime with P, where P is the product of primes less than k. So m must be coprime with P. So the count is equal to the number of integers in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with P.

But again, how to compute that when P is large?

But wait, P is the product of primes less than k. So the primes less than k. So the set S is the primes less than k. So the coprimality with P is equivalent to not being divisible by any prime in S.

So the problem is to compute the count of numbers in [m_start, m_end] that are not divisible by any prime in S.

This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem, but the size of S can be up to the number of primes less than k, which for k up to 2e9 can be very large (like up to 1e8 primes if k is 2e9). So we need an efficient way to compute this.

So the problem now is, given a range [L, R] and a list of primes S, compute the count of numbers in [L, R] not divisible by any of the primes in S.

But when S is large (like thousands or millions of primes), inclusion-exclusion is not feasible. So what's the alternative?

Wait, but if S is the primes less than k, and k is a prime, then S is the set of all primes less than k. So when k is a prime, and the primes in S are all primes less than k. So the problem reduces to finding numbers in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with all primes less than k. But that's the same as numbers that are coprime with the product of all primes less than k. But if that product is larger than R, then perhaps the count is zero, but that's unlikely.

But how can we compute the count of numbers in [L, R] not divisible by any of the primes in S, where S is all primes less than k?

This is the same as the numbers in [L, R] that are coprime with the product of S. But for large S, the product could be huge. So the problem is similar to finding numbers in the range that are coprime with a certain number M (the product of S). But if M is so big that it's impossible to factorize, perhaps the approach is to generate all primes in S and use inclusion-exclusion.

But inclusion-exclusion with a large number of primes (like 1e5) is impossible. So we need another approach.

Wait, but when k is a prime, what is the minimal condition for m to be coprime with all primes less than k?

If m is 1, then it's coprime. If m is a prime >=k, then it's coprime. If m is a composite number composed of primes >=k, then it's coprime. So m can be 1, primes >=k, or products of primes >=k.

But m can be any number not divisible by any primes less than k. So m must be either 1 or have all their prime factors >=k. Because if any prime factor of m is <k, then it's in S, so m would be divisible by that prime.

So the problem is to count the numbers in [m_start, m_end] that are either 1 or have all prime factors >=k.

Wait, but m can be 1 only if k *1 is in [a, b]. For example, if a <=k <=b, then m=1 is allowed. But then m=1 must not be divisible by any primes less than k. Since 1 is not divisible by any primes, so that's okay.

But for other m, like m=2, but k=3 (a prime), then S includes primes 2. So m=2 is divisible by 2 (which is in S), so m=2 is not allowed. So m must not be divisible by any primes in S.

So the problem is to compute the count of m in [m_start, m_end] such that all their prime factors are >=k, or m is 1.

But how to compute that?

This is similar to numbers that are coprime with M, where M is the product of primes less than k. But again, M is huge for large k.

Alternative approach: Sieve of Eratosthenes, but in the range [m_start, m_end], cross out multiples of primes in S (primes less than k). The remaining numbers are those not divisible by any primes in S.

But for large ranges and large S, this approach is impossible. For example, if m_start and m_end are up to 2e9 / 2 = 1e9, and S has primes up to 1e5, then it's impossible to sieve such a large range.

Alternative idea: Let's think about the inclusion-exclusion formula. For a set of primes S = {p1, p2, ..., pn}, the number of integers in [L, R] not divisible by any pi is equal to:

R - L + 1 - sum_{i} floor(R/pi - (L-1)/pi) + sum_{i<j} floor(R/(pi*pj) - (L-1)/(pi*pj)) - ... + (-1)^k sum ... etc.

But the problem is that for large n (number of primes in S), the inclusion-exclusion terms become computationally infeasible. For example, if n is 1e5, the number of terms is 2^1e5, which is way too big.

But perhaps the primes in S are all primes less than k. So if k is small, say k is 1e4, then S has primes up to 1e4. The number of primes less than 1e4 is 1229. Then inclusion-exclusion is impossible, because 2^1229 terms is way too much.

But if k is large, say k is 1e5, then S has primes up to 1e5-1. Number of primes is about 10^4. Still impossible.

So there's a problem here. How can we compute the count of numbers in [L, R] not divisible by any primes in S when S is a large set?

Wait, but in our problem, S is the set of all primes less than k. So for the numbers m in [m_start, m_end], we need to find those that are coprime with all primes in S.

But this is equivalent to m being coprime with the product of all primes in S. Let's call this product M. The count is then equal to the Euler's totient function applied to M for the interval, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, but Euler's totient function counts the numbers up to n coprime with M. But we need the count between L and R. So maybe it's possible to compute the count as:

count = (R // M) * phi(M) + ... (remainder terms). But if M is large (like larger than 1e9), then R // M is 0, and the remainder terms are up to M, which could be huge. So this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative idea: For m to not be divisible by any primes in S, the numbers must be primes >=k, or products of such primes, or 1.

But how to count the numbers in [L, R] that are 1 or have all prime factors >=k.

If k is small (e.g., 3), then this is possible, but for large k, it's more challenging.

Wait, but for example, if k is a large prime (like 1e5), then any number m >=1 in [L, R] that is >=k and is a prime, or a product of primes >=k. But even that, how to count them?

Alternatively, the count of such numbers is equal to the total numbers in [L, R] minus the numbers divisible by any primes in S. But again, for large S, inclusion-exclusion is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find the minimal primes in S. Wait, no. All primes in S are less than k.

Wait, but S is the set of all primes less than k. So the primes in S are the primes up to k-1.

But if k is a prime, then S is the set of primes less than k.

So, for example, if k is 5, S is {2, 3}.

So, numbers m must not be divisible by 2 or 3.

So the count is the numbers in [m_start, m_end] not divisible by 2, 3.

Which can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion.

But if S has many primes, like 1e4 primes, inclusion-exclusion is impossible.

So perhaps there's a way to compute the count using the Möbius function for the product of all primes in S.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion can be represented as the sum over the divisors d of M (product of primes in S) of mu(d) * floor(R/d) - floor((L-1)/d). Where M is the product of primes in S. But when M is large, this is impossible to compute, as M can be as big as the product of all primes up to 2e9, which is way beyond any possible representation.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the problem again. The numbers m must not be divisible by any primes less than k (since k is a prime). So m must be 1, or primes >=k, or products of primes >=k. 

But for m >=1, the numbers that are coprime with all primes less than k are exactly the numbers that are either 1 or primes >=k, or composite numbers formed by primes >=k.

But how can we count these numbers in [L, R]?

This is similar to counting numbers in [L, R] that are 1 or are primes >=k, or have all prime factors >=k.

But how?

Alternatively, this can be thought of as the numbers in [L, R] that are either 1 or have their smallest prime factor >=k.

But how to compute that?

This seems similar to a sieve problem, but again, with large ranges.

Another idea: For a given m in [L, R], the condition is that m is not divisible by any prime <k. So the count is equal to the count of numbers in [L, R] that are co-prime with the product of all primes <k. But again, the product is huge.

But perhaps we can represent the primes <k as a list and compute the inclusion-exclusion sum.

But if the number of primes is large (like 1e5), inclusion-exclusion is impossible. So this suggests that for cases where k is large, the inclusion-exclusion is not feasible, and there's another way.

Wait, but when k is large (like 1e6), then the primes <k are numerous, but their product is so large that any multiple of them in [L, R] would be rare. So for example, if k is 1e6, then primes <k are up to 1e6-1. So the product of all primes up to 1e6 is way larger than 1e9. So the numbers in [L, R] that are multiples of any of these primes would be numbers divisible by a prime <k, but since the primes are large, their multiples may not be present in the [L, R] range.

Wait, but m is in [m_start, m_end], which is [a/k, b/k]. For example, if a and b are up to 2e9, and k is 1e9, then m_start and m_end are up to 2. So the range [m_start, m_end] is small, like 1 to 2. So in this case, we can check each m in that range.

But for cases where k is small, like 3, then m can be up to 2e9 /3, which is around 7e8. So the range can be up to 7e8 numbers. Which is impossible to check individually.

So the problem has varying approaches depending on the size of k.

Hmm, this seems complicated. How can we handle all cases efficiently?

Alternative approach: Split the problem into two cases based on the value of k.

Case 1: k is small (like up to 1e6). Then the primes <k are manageable. We can compute all primes <k and use inclusion-exclusion to calculate the count of numbers in [m_start, m_end] not divisible by any of these primes.

Case 2: k is large. Then the primes <k are up to k-1, which is large. But if k is large, then the primes <k include a lot of primes, but the product of those primes is so large that any multiple of them in the [m_start, m_end] range is zero. For example, if m is in [L, R], and there's a prime p <k, then the minimal multiple of p in [L, R] is p*1. If p >=k (wait, but p is a prime <k), so p is less than k. So if k is large (like 1e9), then the primes <k are up to 1e9-1. But m is in [L, R], which is up to 2e9 /k. If k is 1e9, then m is up to 2. So m can be 1 or 2. For m=1, check if 1 is in [L, R]. For m=2, check if 2 is in [L, R]. But since primes <k are up to 1e9-1, any multiple of those primes (like p) would be >=p, which is >=2. So for example, m=2. We need to check if 2 is divisible by any primes less than k. But if k is 1e9, primes less than k include 2. So 2 is divisible by 2, which is a prime less than k, so m=2 is not allowed. So for m=2, it's not allowed. So the only allowed m is 1. But 1 is allowed only if 1 is in [L, R], and it's not divisible by any primes <k. Since 1 is not divisible by any primes, so yes. So in this case, the count is 1 if 1 is in [m_start, m_end], else zero.

So for large k, perhaps the range [m_start, m_end] is small. So we can iterate over each m in the range and check if it is coprime with all primes <k. But how?

Wait, but when k is large (like 1e9), the primes <k include 2, 3, 5, etc. So even for m=1, which is allowed, but the m=1 is allowed. So for example, if m is 1, then x=k*1 =k. Is k's smallest divisor k? Yes, but only if k is a prime. So yes. Because k is a prime.

So, for large k:

m can be 1, which is allowed. Any other m in the range would have to be >=2. But since the primes <k include 2, any even m would be excluded. Similarly, m divisible by 3,5 etc. So the only allowed m is 1. But wait, what if m is a prime >=k? Wait, but k is a prime. So m would be a prime >=k. For example, if k is 1e9+7 (a prime), then m can be 1, or primes >=k. But since m is in [m_start, m_end], and m_end is up to (2e9)/k. If k is 1e9, then m_end is 2. So m can be 1 or 2. But 2 is a prime <k (since k is 1e9), so m=2 is divisible by 2 (a prime <k), so not allowed. So the only possible allowed m is 1.

So in this case, the count is 1 if m_start <=1 <=m_end, else 0.

So for large k, the approach would be:

Check if 1 is in [m_start, m_end]. If yes, then check if 1 is allowed (i.e., is x =k*1 in [a,b] and m=1 is allowed). But m=1 is allowed if it's not divisible by any primes <k. But 1 is not divisible by any primes, so yes. So the count is 1 if 1 is in the range of m, else 0.

But how to determine when k is large enough that the primes <k make the inclusion-exclusion impossible?

Alternatively, when k is larger than the square root of the maximum possible m (which is up to 2e9 /2 = 1e9), then the primes <k include all primes up to 1e9. But even that is impossible to handle.

So perhaps the key here is to handle two cases:

1. When k is small (primes <k can be enumerated and stored), use inclusion-exclusion.

2. When k is large (primes <k are too numerous to handle), but the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like up to 1e5), then iterate through all possible m in [m_start, m_end], check for each m if it is divisible by any prime <k. If not, then count it.

But how to check if m is divisible by any prime <k?

Well, since k is large, but m is small (since m is in [m_start, m_end], which is up to 1e5), then m can be checked for primality and factors. For each m in the range, check if it has any prime factors less than k. But m is up to 1e5, so trial division can be done quickly for each m.

But how?

Wait, for each m in [m_start, m_end], to check if it's divisible by any primes <k. But since k is large (like 1e9), but m is up to 1e5. Then the primes that can divide m are the primes up to sqrt(m). So for each m, we can check for factors up to sqrt(m). If any of these factors are primes (and thus <k), then m is invalid.

But how to check if m has a prime factor <k.

Alternatively, for a given m, if m is 1, then it's valid. Else, factorize m and see if any of its prime factors are <k. If yes, then m is invalid. Else, valid.

But factorizing m when m is up to 1e5 is manageable via trial division.

So the steps would be:

For each m in [m_start, m_end], check if m is 1 (valid) or if m is >=1 and has no prime factors <k.

So the plan is:

If k is not prime: output 0.

Else:

Compute m_start = ceil(a /k), m_end = floor(b /k). The numbers x =k*m must be in [a, b].

If m_start >m_end: output 0.

Else:

Check if any of the primes less than k divide any of the m in [m_start, m_end].

But this depends on whether we can handle the primes <k.

So the approach is split into two parts based on the value of k.

But how to decide which case to handle.

Let me think: when k is small, the primes <k can be generated (e.g., using sieve of Eratosthenes) and used in inclusion-exclusion. When k is large, the range [m_start, m_end] is small, so iterate through each m and check for factors <k.

So the steps:

1. Check if k is prime. If not, output 0.

2. Compute m_start and m_end.

3. If there are no primes less than k (i.e., k=2), then all m in the range are valid. So the count is m_end -m_start +1.

Wait, wait. For example, k=2. The primes less than 2 are none. So the condition for m is that x is divisible by 2 (since k=2), and no primes less than 2 divide x. But since there are none, so all even x in [a,b] are valid. So the count is the number of even numbers in [a,b]. But x=2m must be in [a,b], so m ranges from m_start to m_end, and all such m are valid because there are no primes less than 2. So the count is m_end -m_start +1.

Yes. So if k=2, the answer is m_end -m_start +1.

But in code, this can be handled by checking if k is 2. Then the primes less than k is an empty list. So the count is m_end -m_start +1.

But when k is larger than 2 and a prime, but the primes less than k are in S, then:

If k is small, say 3, then the primes less than 3 is [2]. So S is [2]. So the numbers m must not be divisible by 2. So the count is the numbers in [m_start, m_end] that are odd.

So for this case, inclusion-exclusion is manageable.

So the code steps are:

First, check if k is prime.

If not, output 0.

Else, check if there are any primes less than k. If not (i.e., k=2), then output the number of m in [m_start, m_end].

Else:

Generate all primes less than k. Let's call this list primes.

Now, check the size of primes. If the number of primes is small (e.g., up to 20), then use inclusion-exclusion. Else, if the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like up to 1e6), then iterate over each m and check for divisibility by any primes in the list.

But how to decide whether to use inclusion-exclusion or trial division for each m?

Alternatively, for each m in the range, check if any of the primes less than k divides m. If yes, then m is invalid. Else, valid.

But when primes is large, checking each prime for each m in the range is time-consuming.

So for example, if primes is 1e4 in size, and the range [m_start, m_end] is 1e5 numbers, then 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9 operations, which is way too slow.

But if the primes are up to 1e5 and the range is 1e5 numbers, then again, it's 1e10 operations, which is impossible.

Thus, we need a way to handle this efficiently.

So the code needs to be optimized for two cases:

- When the list of primes is small (like up to 20), use inclusion-exclusion.

- When the list of primes is large, but the range [m_start, m_end] is small, use trial division for each m.

But how to decide which case to use.

The key idea is that the inclusion-exclusion approach's time complexity is O(2^r), where r is the number of primes. So if r is up to 20, 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable. But if r is 30, 2^30 is a billion, which is not manageable.

So for the inclusion-exclusion approach to be feasible, the number of primes in S (primes less than k) must be up to around 20.

But how to determine that.

So the code can first generate the list of primes less than k. If the size is small (like <=20), then use inclusion-exclusion. Else, check if the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like <=1e5), and for each m in the range, check if it is coprime with all primes in S.

But how to check if m is coprime with all primes in S.

Wait, but primes in S are all primes less than k. So if m is <=k, then any prime factor of m that is in S would have to be <=m. But for example, if m is 1e5 and k is 1e6, then the primes in S are up to 1e6-1. So even if m is 1e5, we need to check if any of the primes less than k (which could be up to 1e6-1) divide m.

But if m is 1e5, the primes less than 1e6 that divide m are the primes that divide m. But m is 1e5. So the primes that divide m are 2,5. So if 2 and 5 are in S (i.e., k is greater than 5), then m is invalid.

So for each m in the range, we can check if m has any prime factors in S.

But how to check this efficiently.

Wait, the primes in S are all primes less than k. So if any of the primes less than k divide m, then m is invalid. So for a given m, we need to check if m is divisible by any primes in S.

But for large S (like 1e5 primes), checking each prime for divisibility would be too slow.

Alternative approach: precompute all primes in S. Then, for each m, check if any of the primes in S divide m.

But for m up to 1e5 and S up to 1e5 primes, this is 1e5 *1e5 = 1e10 operations, which is impossible.

Thus, we need a better way.

Alternative idea: precompute the smallest prime factor (SPF) for numbers up to sqrt(m_end). But if m_end is up to 1e9 (since a and b can be up to 2e9 and k can be 2, leading to m_end up to 1e9), this is not feasible.

Alternatively, for each m in the range [m_start, m_end], we can check if m is divisible by any primes in S by doing trial division for primes up to sqrt(m). But if m is up to 1e5, this is manageable.

Wait, but S contains all primes less than k. For example, if k is 1e6, then S contains primes up to 1e6-1. So even if m is 1e5, any prime in S that divides m must be <= m. But m is in the range [m_start, m_end], which can be up to 1e9 (if k is 2 and a=1, b=2e9, m_end is 1e9).

But for m up to 1e9, trial division up to sqrt(m) is O(1e4) per m. So if the range [m_start, m_end] is 1e5 numbers, then 1e5 *1e4 = 1e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, this approach is not feasible for large ranges.

Alternative idea: For each m in the range, check if m is 1. If yes, valid. Else, check if m is a prime >=k. Or, check if m is composite and all its prime factors are >=k.

But how to check this quickly.

If m is a prime >=k, then it's valid. If m is composite and all its factors are >=k, then it's valid. But how to check that.

An alternative approach for m is to check if m has any prime factors less than k. If no, then it's valid. But how to do that.

But for this, we can factorize m and check if any prime factors are less than k.

But factorizing m for large m can be time-consuming.

But in the code, the code will need to handle two cases:

Case 1: when the number of primes in S is small (like <=20). Use inclusion-exclusion.

Case 2: when the number of primes in S is large. Then, if the range [m_start, m_end] is small, check each m individually. For each m, check if it is divisible by any primes in S.

But how to check that when S is large.

Wait, but if S is large (like primes up to 1e5), but the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like up to 1e5), then for each m in the range, check if any prime in S divides m. But checking all primes in S for each m is time-consuming.

So here's the crux: when k is large, but S has a lot of primes, but the range [m_start, m_end] is small, then for each m in the range, we can factorize m and see if any of its factors are in S.

But how to factorize m quickly.

But factorizing m can be done via trial division up to sqrt(m). For m up to 1e5, this is manageable.

But for example, m=1e5. Its square root is 316. So trial division up to 316.

So for each m in the range [m_start, m_end], we can:

- Check if m is 1. Valid.

- Else, check if m is divisible by 2. If yes, then 2 <k (since k is a prime and S contains primes less than k). So invalid.

- Else, check divisors up to sqrt(m). For each divisor found, check if it is in S. If any divisor is in S, then invalid.

But wait, but S contains all primes less than k. So any prime divisor of m that is less than k would be in S. So for m, if any prime factor is less than k, then m is invalid.

So for m, the steps are:

For m=1: valid.

Else:

Check if any prime factor of m is less than k.

If yes: invalid.

Else: valid.

So how to check if any prime factor of m is less than k.

But we can factorize m into primes and check if any of them are less than k.

But factorizing m can be time-consuming for large m. But if m is up to 1e5, trial division is manageable.

But wait, for m up to 1e9, trial division is O(sqrt(m)) which can be up to 3e4 steps per m. Which is manageable if the range is small (like 1e5 m's).

But in practice, when k is large, the range [m_start, m_end] is small. For example, when k is 1e9, m can be up to 2e9 /1e9 = 2. So the range is m_start=1 to m_end=2. So two m's.

So for each of those m's, we can check if they have any prime factors less than k.

For m=1: valid.

For m=2: check if 2 <k. If k is 1e9, then yes. So 2 is a prime factor less than k. So m=2 is invalid. So the count is 1 (only m=1).

So the code can proceed as follows:

After checking k is a prime, compute m_start and m_end.

If m_start > m_end: output 0.

Else:

Generate the list of primes less than k. Let's call this primes_less_than_k.

If primes_less_than_k is empty (k=2):

   count = m_end -m_start +1.

Else:

   if the number of primes_less_than_k is <=20:

      use inclusion-exclusion to compute the count.

   else:

      check if the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like <=1e4):

         iterate through each m in the range, and check if it is coprime with all primes_less_than_k.

         To check this, for each m:

             if m ==1: valid.

             else:

                 check if m is divisible by any prime in primes_less_than_k.

                 if any division, then invalid.

                 else: valid.

      else:

         it's impossible to compute, but in practice, this case won't happen because for larger ranges and large primes_less_than_k, the product of primes_less_than_k is so large that the count is zero.

But how to handle this? Because for example, when primes_less_than_k is large and the range [m_start, m_end] is also large.

But in such cases, any m in the range would have to be coprime with all primes_less_than_k, which is only possible if m=1. Because primes_less_than_k includes all primes up to k-1, which is large, so any m >=2 would have to be a product of primes >=k, but since k is large, such products are larger than the m_end.

For example, k=1e5. m_end=2e9 /1e5 = 2e4. So m can be up to 2e4. To be valid, m must be 1 or a product of primes >=1e5. But primes >=1e5 are at least 1e5. So any product of two primes would be (1e5)^2=1e10, which is larger than 2e4. So the only possible valid m is 1. So the count is 1 if m_start <=1 <=m_end, else 0.

So this suggests that for large k and large ranges, the only possible valid m is 1.

But how to determine when this is the case.

An alternative approach is to check whether any primes_less_than_k divides m. For m >=2, if any primes_less_than_k is <= m, then m is divisible by at least one of them. So if m >=2 and there exists a prime p in primes_less_than_k where p <= m, then m is invalid.

But this depends on whether primes_less_than_k includes primes <= m.

So for example, if m is 2 and primes_less_than_k includes 2, then m is invalid.

But if primes_less_than_k has primes up to k-1, which is larger than m, then m can be valid.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps for the code, after generating the primes_less_than_k, the code can handle the cases as follows:

If the primes_less_than_k is not empty:

   if the number of primes_less_than_k is small (e.g., <=20), use inclusion-exclusion.

   else:

      compute the minimal prime in primes_less_than_k. Since primes_less_than_k is sorted, the first prime is 2.

      Then, for the range [m_start, m_end], the only valid m's are those that are 1, and possibly primes >=k, but if k is large, the primes >=k are larger than m_end. 

      So in this case, the valid m's are 1 and any primes >=k in [m_start, m_end]. But if k is large, and m_end is small, there are no primes >=k in the range. So the only valid m is 1.

So to compute this:

count = 0

if 1 is in [m_start, m_end], increment count by 1.

then, check if there are any primes >=k in [m_start, m_end]. But if k is large, like 1e9, and m_end is 2, then primes >=k would be >=1e9. But 2 <1e9, so no. So the count is 1 if 1 is in range.

But how to check if any primes >=k exist in [m_start, m_end].

But m is in [m_start, m_end], and must be >=k. So if m >=k, then m >=k. But since m_end is <= b/k, and k is large, m_end is small.

For example, if k is 1e9, then m_end is up to 2e9 /1e9 = 2. So m can be 1 or 2. So primes >=k are >=1e9, which is larger than 2. So no primes exist in the range.

Thus, in this case, the count is 1 if 1 is in the range.

But how to compute this for code.

Alternatively, for the case where primes_less_than_k is large, the code can:

count = 0

if 1 is within [m_start, m_end], then count +=1.

for each m in [m_start, m_end] where m >=k:

   check if m is a prime.

   if yes, and m is a prime >=k, then count +=1.

   else, check if m is a composite made of primes >=k. But for m >=k, the minimal prime factor is >=k, so m must be a product of primes >=k. So for example, m= k * k. But if k is 1e9, then m=1e18, which is larger than m_end (which is 2).

Thus, for m >=k, the code can check if m is a prime.

But for m up to 1e5, checking primality is manageable.

So the steps would be:

for m in [m_start, m_end]:

   if m ==1:

      count +=1

   elif m >=k:

      if is_prime(m):

          count +=1

      else:

          check if m is composite and all factors are >=k.

But how to check this.

Alternatively, since m >=k and k is a prime, if m is composite, then its factors must be >=k, but since m >=k, the minimal factor could be a prime >=k.

For example, m= k * 2. But 2 is a prime <k, so m would be divisible by 2, which is in primes_less_than_k. So m would have been rejected already. So in the code, for m >=k, after checking if m is a prime, the code also needs to check if m has any factors in primes_less_than_k.

Wait, but this is getting complicated.

But in the code, for the case where primes_less_than_k is large (e.g., len(primes) >20), and the range [m_start, m_end] is small:

for each m in the range:

   if m is 1: count +=1

   else:

      if m >=k:

          if is_prime(m):

              count +=1

          else:

              check if m is coprime with all primes_less_than_k.

But how to check if m is coprime with all primes_less_than_k.

But m can be up to 1e5. So for each m, the code can check divisibility by primes_less_than_k. But primes_less_than_k could be up to 1e6 primes.

This is not feasible.

So this suggests that for large primes_less_than_k and small ranges, the only valid m is 1.

But this is not always the case.

For example, k=3. primes_less_than_k is [2]. So m can be 3 (m=1: x=3*1=3). But wait, no. For k=3, m must be in [a/3, b/3]. So if a=3 and b=3, m=1. Then x=3*1=3. The smallest divisor of 3 is 3. So valid.

But in this case, k is small, so the code would use inclusion-exclusion.

But the code needs to handle all cases.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

After checking k is a prime and generating primes_less_than_k:

If primes_less_than_k is empty (k=2):

   count = m_end -m_start +1.

Else:

   if len(primes_less_than_k) <=20:

      use inclusion-exclusion to compute the count.

   else:

      if the range [m_start, m_end] is small (like up to 1e5):

          count = 0

          for m in range(m_start, m_end+1):

              if m ==1:

                  count +=1

              else:

                  valid = True

                  for p in primes_less_than_k:

                      if p > m:

                          break

                      if m % p ==0:

                          valid = False

                          break

                  if valid:

                      count +=1

          output count

      else:

          # For larger ranges and large primes_less_than_k, it's impossible to have valid m's except 1.

          count = 1 if (m_start <=1 <=m_end) else 0

But how to determine the threshold for when the range is considered small.

But this is a heuristic and may not cover all cases. However, given the time constraints, this approach might work.

Now, the code needs to:

1. Check if k is a prime. If not, output 0.

2. Generate the list of primes less than k.

3. Compute m_start and m_end.

4. Handle the cases based on the size of the primes list and the range.

So now, the code steps:

First, implement a Miller-Rabin primality test for k.

Then, if k is not a prime, output 0.

Else, generate all primes less than k.

For generating primes less than k, when k is up to 2e9, we need an efficient sieve. But for k up to 2e9, sieve of Eratosthenes is impossible. So we need an alternative method.

Wait, generating all primes less than k when k is up to 2e9 is impossible using sieve of Eratosthenes due to memory and time constraints. So this approach is not feasible.

So this suggests that generating all primes less than k is not feasible for large k.

But this is a problem. Because the code needs to know the primes less than k to compute the inclusion-exclusion or to check for divisibility.

Thus, the previous approach is not feasible for large k.

So this suggests that the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative approach:

If k is not a prime: output 0.

Else:

The numbers x in [a,b] must be multiples of k and not divisible by any number from 2 to k-1.

Which is equivalent to x being a multiple of k and coprime with (k-1)!.

But x is a multiple of k, so x =k *m.

The condition is that m is not divisible by any prime less than k (since if m is divisible by a prime p <k, then x is divisible by p, which is less than k, so x's smallest divisor is p, not k).

So the problem reduces to counting m in [m_start, m_end] where m is coprime with all primes less than k.

But the issue is generating the primes less than k.

But for large k, generating all primes less than k is impossible. So what's the solution?

Alternative idea: The smallest prime factor of x is k. So x must be a multiple of k, and for x, all primes less than k do not divide x. But x is a multiple of k. So x must be k multiplied by a number m that is coprime with all primes less than k.

But m can be 1, or a product of primes >=k.

But to find the count of m in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with all primes less than k.

But how to compute this without explicitly generating all primes less than k.

Wait, but the numbers m must not be divisible by any primes less than k. So m must be 1 or have all prime factors >=k.

So for example, m can be 1, a prime >=k, a product of two primes >=k, etc.

But how to count such numbers in [m_start, m_end].

But this is equivalent to counting numbers in [m_start, m_end] that are either 1 or are primes >=k, or products of primes >=k.

But again, it's challenging to count this.

But if k is large, then m_end is small. For example, if k is 1e9 and a=1e9, b=2e9, then m_end is 2. So m can be 1 or 2. For each m, check if they are coprime with all primes less than k. But how.

Alternatively, the code can check if m is 1 (valid) or if m is >=k and is prime (valid), or check if m is a product of primes >=k. But again, this is difficult.

But when m is in [m_start, m_end], and m >=k:

If m is a prime >=k, then it's valid.

If m is composite, then all its prime factors must be >=k. But the minimal prime factor of a composite m is <= sqrt(m). So for example, if m is 1e5, and k is 1e4, then m's minimal prime factor is at least 1e4. So sqrt(1e5) is about 316. So if k is 1e4, then the minimal prime factor of m must be >=1e4, but 316 <1e4. So this is impossible. Thus, m cannot be composite and valid. So for m >=k to be valid, it must be a prime.

Thus, for large k, the only valid m's are 1 and primes >=k in [m_start, m_end].

But how to count the primes >=k in [m_start, m_end].

But the range [m_start, m_end] is up to 2e9 /2 = 1e9. So for large k, m_start and m_end can be large. But checking for primes in a large range is time-consuming.

Thus, the problem seems very challenging.

But wait, the problem's constraints allow for time limits of 3 seconds. So perhaps we can find a way.

An alternative approach:

Once we've determined that k is a prime, we need to count the numbers in [a, b] that are divisible by k and not divisible by any primes less than k.

But for x to be divisible by k and not by any primes less than k, x must be k multiplied by a number m that is 1 or a product of primes >=k.

But how to count such m in [m_start, m_end].

But m can be 1, or a prime >=k, or a product of two primes >=k, etc.

But for example, if k is 5, then m can be 1, 5, 7, 11, 5*5=25, etc.

But the count is equivalent to the number of m in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with all primes less than k.

But again, the problem is to compute this count without knowing all the primes less than k.

But this seems impossible.

Alternative idea:

If k is a prime, and the numbers must not be divisible by any primes less than k, then the numbers x must be k multiplied by a number m that is either 1 or has all prime factors >=k.

Thus, x is k, 2k, 3k, ... only if those numbers are not divisible by any primes less than k.

But this is the same as x being a multiple of k, and x is a prime (k itself), or x is a multiple of k but the other factors are >=k.

But again, this doesn't directly help.

Another observation: For x to have its smallest divisor equal to k, it must be that k is the smallest prime factor of x. So x can be written as k * m, where m is not divisible by any primes less than k. So m must be 1 or a product of primes >=k.

But m can't be divisible by any primes less than k.

But how to count such m in [m_start, m_end] without knowing all primes less than k.

But this is the crux of the problem.

So perhaps the code can proceed as follows:

Check if k is prime. If not, return 0.

Compute m_start = ceil(a/k), m_end = floor(b/k).

If m_start >m_end: return 0.

Now, the problem is to find the count of m in [m_start, m_end] that are coprime with all primes less than k.

But how to do this without enumerating the primes less than k.

Alternative approach: Check if there exists any primes less than k that divide m. If any such prime exists, m is invalid.

But how to check this without knowing the primes less than k.

But for this, we can factorize m and check if any of its prime factors are less than k.

Because if m is divisible by any prime p <k, then p is a prime factor of m, and thus m is invalid.

So for each m in [m_start, m_end], the code can check if any of its prime factors are less than k.

If no, then m is valid.

Thus, the code can proceed as:

count =0

for m in [m_start, m_end]:

   if m ==0:

      continue

   x =k *m

   if x <a or x >b:

      continue

   if m ==1:

      count +=1

      continue

   # check if m has any prime factors <k

   if any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

      continue

   else:

      count +=1

return count

But how to implement any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k).

This function checks if m has any prime factors less than k.

To check this, factorize m and check if any prime factor is <k.

But factorizing m could be time-consuming for large m.

But if m is up to 1e9 (since k could be 2, leading to m_end up to 1e9), factorizing each m would take O(sqrt(m)) time.

But for m up to 1e9, sqrt(m) is 3e4, which for 1e9 m's would be 3e13 operations, which is impossible.

But in practice, for large k, m_end is small. For example, if k is 1e9, m_end is 2.

So the code can factorize m for small m.

Thus, the code can proceed as:

def any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

   if m ==1:

      return False

   if m %2 ==0:

      return 2 <k

   i =3

   while i*i <=m:

      if m%i ==0:

          if i <k:

              return True

          # check if i is a factor

          while m%i ==0:

              m //=i

          if m ==1:

              break

      i +=2

   if m >1:

      return m <k

   return False

This function checks if m has any prime factors less than k by trial division.

But this is feasible if m is small.

Thus, the code can use this approach.

But for large m (like 1e9), this function would take O(3e4) steps per m.

But if the range [m_start, m_end] is large (like 1e9), this is impossible.

But in practice, when k is small, the code would have to handle large ranges, but this function would be too slow.

Thus, this approach is only feasible when the range [m_start, m_end] is small.

So the code must handle two cases:

Case 1: k is small. Then, generate the primes less than k using sieve of Eratosthenes and use inclusion-exclusion.

Case 2: k is large. Then, the range [m_start, m_end] is small, and each m can be checked individually.

But how to determine when k is small or large.

The code can proceed as follows:

First, check if k is a prime using Miller-Rabin.

If not, output 0.

Else, compute m_start and m_end.

If m_start >m_end: output 0.

If k ==2: output m_end -m_start +1.

Else:

   Check if k is small enough to generate all primes less than k using sieve.

   For example, if k <=1e6, generate primes using sieve of Eratosthenes.

   For k >1e6, the sieve is not feasible.

Thus, the code can split into two cases based on k's size.

If k <=1e6:

   Generate primes less than k using sieve.

   Use inclusion-exclusion if the number of primes is small (<=20), else use the trial division approach for each m in the range.

Else:

   For each m in [m_start, m_end], check if any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k) is false. If yes, count +=1.

But how to generate primes less than k when k is up to 1e6.

This is feasible with sieve.

But for k up to 1e6, the sieve would require O(k) space and time, which is manageable.

But for larger k, sieve is not feasible.

Thus, the code can proceed as:

Check if k is prime.

If not, output 0.

Else:

   m_start = (a +k -1) //k

   m_end = b //k

   if m_start >m_end:

      output 0

   else:

      if k ==2:

          output m_end -m_start +1

      else:

          if k <=1e6:

              # generate primes less than k using sieve

              sieve = [True] * (k)

              sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False

              for i in range(2, int(k**0.5)+1):

                      sieve[i*i :k :i] = [False]*len(sieve[i*i :k :i])

              primes_less_than_k = [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]

          else:

              # So use trial division for each m.

              pass

          # Now, handle the primes_less_than_k.

          if k <=1e6 and len(primes_less_than_k) <=20:

              # use inclusion-exclusion.

              # Compute the count of numbers in [m_start, m_end] not divisible by any primes in primes_less_than_k.

              # inclusion-exclusion code.

          else:

              # iterate over each m in [m_start, m_end] and check if it is coprime with primes_less_than_k.

              # But if k is large, primes_less_than_k is not generated, so use trial division for each m.

              count =0

              for m in range(m_start, m_end+1):

                  if m ==0:

                      continue

                  if m ==1:

                      count +=1

                      continue

                  # check if m has any prime factors <k.

                  if any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

                      continue

                  else:

                      count +=1

              print(count)

But how to handle the inclusion-exclusion case when k is small and the number of primes is small.

Inclusion-exclusion code:

The code can generate all subsets of the primes_less_than_k and compute the inclusion-exclusion sum.

The code for inclusion-exclusion:

def inclusion_exclusion(m_start, m_end, primes):

    n = len(primes)

    total =0

    for mask in range(1, 1<<n):

        bits = bin(mask).count('1')

        product =1

        for i in range(n):

            if mask & (1<<i):

                if product > m_end:

                    product = -1

                    break

                product *= primes[i]

        if product ==-1:

            continue

        cnt = (m_end // product) - ((m_start-1) // product)

        if bits %2 ==1:

            total += cnt

        else:

            total -= cnt

    return (m_end -m_start +1) - total

So, the code can use this function to compute the count.

But this is only feasible when the number of primes is small (like up to 20), as it requires 2^n operations.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

if len(primes_less_than_k) <=20:

    count = inclusion_exclusion(m_start, m_end, primes_less_than_k)

    print(count)

else:

    # use the trial division approach for each m.

    # but when k is large, primes_less_than_k is not generated, so use the any_prime_factor_less_than_k function.

    count =0

    for m in range(m_start, m_end+1):

        if m ==0:

            continue

        if m ==1:

            count +=1

            continue

        if any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

            continue

        else:

            count +=1

    print(count)

But this approach requires implementing the any_prime_factor_less_than_k function.

So putting it all together.

The code steps are:

1. Check if k is prime.

2. Compute m_start and m_end.

3. If k is 2, output the count of m's.

4. Else, generate primes_less_than_k via sieve if k <=1e6.

5. For primes_less_than_k:

   a. If the number of primes is <=20, use inclusion-exclusion.

   b. Else, check each m in [m_start, m_end] using trial division.

6. For k >1e6, check each m in [m_start, m_end] using trial division.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows.

Now, the code must handle all these cases.

But for the sieve when k is up to 1e6, it's manageable.

But the code may have some edge cases to handle, like when a=1 and k=1, but k is at least 2.

But according to the problem constraints, k >=2.

Now, implementing the code:

But first, the Miller-Rabin code for checking if k is a prime.

The code for Miller-Rabin:

def is_prime(n):

    if n <=1:

        return False

    elif n <=3:

        return True

    elif n%2 ==0:

        return False

    # Write n-1 as d*2^s

    d =n-1

    s=0

    while d%2 ==0:

        d //=2

        s +=1

    # Check for a few bases.

    bases = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]

    for a in bases:

        if a >=n:

            continue

        x = pow(a, d, n)

        if x ==1 or x ==n-1:

            continue

        for _ in range(s-1):

            x = pow(x, 2, n)

            if x ==n-1:

                break

        else:

            return False

    return True

This function checks primality for n up to 2^64.

Next, the any_prime_factor_less_than_k function:

def has_any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

    if m ==1:

        return False

    if m <k:

        return True # because m has factors (like m itself) which are <k.

    # Check divisibility by 2.

    if m %2 ==0:

        return 2 <k

    # Check odd factors up to sqrt(m).

    i =3

    while i*i <=m:

        if m%i ==0:

            if i <k:

                return True

            # Divide out all factors of i.

            while m%i ==0:

                m //=i

            if m ==1:

                break

        i +=2

    if m >1:

        return m <k

    return False

This function returns True if m has any prime factor less than k.

Now, the inclusion-exclusion function:

def inclusion_exclusion(m_start, m_end, primes):

    n = len(primes)

    total =0

    for mask in range(1, 1<<n):

        bits = bin(mask).count('1')

        product =1

        overflow = False

        for i in range(n):

            if mask & (1 <<i):

                if product > m_end // primes[i]:

                    overflow = True

                    break

                product *= primes[i]

        if overflow or product > m_end:

            continue

        cnt = (m_end // product) - ((m_start-1) // product)

        if bits %2 ==1:

            total += cnt

        else:

            total -= cnt

    return (m_end - m_start +1) - total

This function computes the count of numbers in [m_start, m_end] not divisible by any primes in the list.

Finally, putting it all together:

Read a, b, k.

Check if k is 1, but according to constraints, k >=2.

Check if k is prime using is_prime(k). If not, print 0.

Else:

Compute m_start = (a +k -1) //k

Compute m_end = b //k

If m_start >m_end: print(0)

Else:

If k ==2:

    print(m_end - m_start +1)

Else:

    if k <=1e6:

        # sieve to generate primes less than k.

        sieve = [True]*(k)

        sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False

        for i in range(2, int(k**0.5)+1):

            if sieve[i]:

                sieve[i*i :k :i] = [False]*( (k-1 -i*i)//i +1 )

        primes_less_than_k = [i for i, is_p in enumerate(sieve) if is_p]

    else:

        primes_less_than_k = []

    if len(primes_less_than_k) ==0:

        # k is 2.

        # but already handled earlier.

        print(m_end -m_start +1)

    else:

        if k <=1e6 and len(primes_less_than_k) <=20:

            count = inclusion_exclusion(m_start, m_end, primes_less_than_k)

            print(count)

        else:

            # Check each m in the range.

            count =0

            for m in range(m_start, m_end+1):

                if m ==0:

                    continue

                if not has_any_prime_factor_less_than_k(m, k):

                    count +=1

            print(count)

But wait, in the case where k >1e6, the code does not generate primes_less_than_k. So the code uses the has_any_prime_factor_less_than_k function to check for each m.

But the function has_any_prime_factor_less_than_k is designed to check whether m has any prime factors less than k, which is what we need.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

Sample 3:

Input:

6 19 5

k=5.

Check if 5 is prime. Yes.

primes less than 5: [2,3].

So m_start=6//5=2 (since 5*2=10 >=6). m_end=19//5=3.

m=2: check if any primes less than 5 divide 2. 2 is in primes_less_than_k. So yes. Invalid.

m=3: 3 is in primes_less_than_k. So yes. Invalid.

So count is 0.

Which matches the sample.

Another sample case where k is a large prime.

For example, a=5, b=5, k=5. Then x=5. The smallest divisor is 5. So count is 1.

Another test case: a=5, b=10, k=5. x=5, 10.

x=5: smallest divisor 5.

x=10: divisible by 2, which is <5. So invalid. So count 1.

Thus, the code should handle these cases.

Now, the code needs to handle when k is large.

For example, a=1e9, b=1e9, k=1e9+7 (a prime). m_start=1e9/(1e9+7) =0. So m_start=1 (since 1e9 is >=1e9+7 *1? No. 1e9 <1e9+7. So m_start=0. But m must be >=1 to have x >=1e9.

So m_start=0, but x=0*1e9+7=0 <a. So the code would have m_start=0, but the code will loop from 0 to 0. For m=0: skip. So count=0.

But wait, the code for m in range(m_start, m_end+1):

So if m_start is 0, m_end is 0, the loop will process m=0.

But in the code, m=0 is skipped because x =0, which is outside [a, b].

Thus, the code should handle this case correctly.

Another test case: a= k, b= k. Then m_start=1, m_end=1.

Check if k is a prime. Then, if k is a prime, x=k. The smallest divisor is k. So count 1.

Thus, the code should output 1.

Thus, the code seems to handle all cases.
