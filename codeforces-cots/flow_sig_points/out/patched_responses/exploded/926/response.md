Okay, let's see. The problem is to split a number into two parts such that neither part has leading zeros, and the sum of the two numbers is minimized. The input is a string of digits of length l (at least 2). We need to find the split point where the sum is the smallest possible.

First, let's understand the constraints. The split has to be between two digits, dividing the string into two non-empty parts. Also, neither part can start with a zero. So for example, if the number is '101', possible splits are after the first or second character. Splitting after the first gives '1' and '01' which is invalid because '01' starts with zero. So the valid split is after the second character: '10' and '1', sum is 11.

The challenge is to find the split point that gives the minimal sum. The number can be up to 1e5 digits long, which is a big number. So handling the numbers as integers or even as strings and adding them directly might not be feasible because converting a 1e5-digit string to an integer would take O(n) time, but even then, adding such large numbers could be computationally intensive.

Wait, but how to compute the sum of two very large numbers efficiently? Because for each possible split point, we have to compute the sum. For l up to 1e5, considering all possible split points (which are l-1 possibilities) would be O(n) steps, but each step requires adding two numbers of up to 1e5 digits. That's O(n^2) time in the worst case, which would be 1e10 operations. That's way too slow for a 2-second time limit.

So, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about how to find the split points efficiently and compute the minimal sum.

First, the split can't be at a position where either part starts with a zero. So, for a split position i (the split after the ith character), the left part is s[0..i], which must not start with a zero unless it's a single digit. Wait, no. Both parts must be non-empty and cannot have leading zeros. So the left part is s[0..i], which can't have leading zero unless i=0 (but i starts from 1 to l-1). Wait, split positions are between digits. So for example, for a string of length 3, split positions are after first and after second digits. So the left part could be of length 1, 2, etc. So for each possible split position, check that the left and right parts don't start with a zero.

So first, we need to iterate through all possible split positions where both parts are valid (no leading zeros). Then, among those, compute the sum and find the minimal.

But for large l, how do we efficiently compute the sum for each possible split point?

Wait, but the minimal sum would likely come from splits that make the two parts as balanced in length as possible, especially when the digits are such that splitting in the middle gives smaller numbers. For example, in the first sample, the split is 4 and 3 digits. So perhaps the optimal split is near the middle of the string.

But even so, how to find it without checking all possible split points?

Alternatively, maybe there are a limited number of split points that can yield the minimal sum, and we can check only those candidates.

Wait, but what's the minimal sum? The sum of two numbers is minimized when the two numbers are as small as possible, but their lengths also matter. For example, splitting into a 1-digit and a (l-1)-digit number might be worse than splitting into two roughly equal parts.

But how to find the split points that are candidates for the minimal sum.

Another observation: For the sum to be minimal, the split should be at a position where the left and right parts are as small as possible. Since leading zeros are not allowed, the split can't occur where the left or right part starts with a zero.

So first, the split positions can only be in positions where the left part's first digit is non-zero, and the right part's first digit is non-zero.

So first, we need to collect all valid split positions. For example, in the case of '101', the valid splits are after the first digit (left is '1', right is '01' which is invalid), so invalid. Only split after the second digit: left is '10', right is '1', both valid.

So the first step is to find all possible split positions where both left and right parts don't start with a zero.

Then, among those split positions, compute the sum of the left and right numbers, and select the minimal.

But how to compute the sum quickly for each split position?

The problem is that the numbers can be very large (up to 1e5 digits), so converting them to integers isn't feasible. So we need a way to add two very large numbers represented as strings efficiently.

Wait, but even adding two numbers of lengths m and n, the sum can be computed in O(max(m, n)) time. If the split positions are O(1) in number, then the total time is manageable. But if there are O(l) split positions, then each with O(l) time, the total is O(l^2), which for l=1e5 would be 1e10 operationsâ€”way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

So, the key is to find that among all possible split positions, only a few candidates can possibly give the minimal sum, so we can check those candidates only.

But which candidates?

Let's think: the minimal sum is likely when the two numbers are as small as possible. So, perhaps the split should be around the middle of the string, but adjusted to avoid leading zeros.

So, for example, the optimal split is around the middle, but we can check split positions near the middle where the left and right parts don't start with zero.

So here's the idea: find the split positions that are around the middle of the string. For example, for even length l, split into l/2 and l/2 digits. For odd l, split into (l-1)/2 and (l+1)/2 digits.

But perhaps there are two possible split positions around the middle. For example, in a string of even length, the split is exactly in the middle. For odd length, perhaps we can check splits at floor(l/2) and ceil(l/2) positions.

Moreover, after splitting, the two parts must not have leading zeros.

So the algorithm could be:

1. Find the split positions near the middle (like mid and mid+1, etc.), but ensuring that the left and right parts are valid (no leading zeros).

2. For each such candidate split position, compute the sum of the two parts.

3. Among all candidate sums, choose the minimal one.

But how to find those candidates?

Alternatively, since leading zeros are not allowed, the split must be such that the left part starts with a non-zero digit (since it's the first digit of the string) unless the entire left part is a single non-zero digit. Wait, the left part is the entire prefix. For example, if the split is at position i, then the left part is the substring from 0 to i. Since the original number does not have leading zeros, the left part's first digit is non-zero. So the left part is always valid (since the entire number has no leading zeros, so the left part's first digit is non-zero). Wait, the left part is the prefix, so its first digit is the same as the original number's first digit. Which is non-zero. So the left part is always valid (as long as it's non-empty). But the right part may start with a zero, which makes it invalid.

Ah, right. So the split is valid only if the right part (the suffix) does not start with a zero.

So the split positions are those where the right part's first character is not '0'.

So, the problem reduces to: find all split positions (i) from 1 to l-1, where the (i+1)th character (s[i] if 0-based) is not '0'. Then, among those split positions, compute the sum of the left and right parts, and find the minimal sum.

But how to handle this efficiently?

Wait, for l=1e5, the split positions could be up to 1e5-1, but many of them may have the right part starting with 0. So the number of valid split positions could be much smaller. For example, if the right part is a single digit, which is non-zero, then that's valid. So for each split position, check if the next character is non-zero.

So, first, we can collect all possible split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero digit.

Then, among those, compute the sum of the two parts and find the minimal.

But even with that, if the number of valid splits is O(l), then for each split, adding two numbers of O(l) digits is O(l) per split, leading to O(l^2) time.

Which is impossible for l=1e5.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

So, what's the alternative?

We need a way to find the split position that gives the minimal sum, without checking all possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when the two parts are as small as possible, which would be when they have the least possible digits. But splitting into 1 and l-1 digits may not be possible if the right part starts with zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is obtained when the two numbers have the minimal possible length. For example, the split is as early as possible (so that the left part is as short as possible) but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, the minimal sum is achieved when the two numbers are as balanced as possible. For example, when split into two numbers of similar lengths, their sum would be smaller than splitting into one very long and one very short number.

So, perhaps the optimal split is around the middle of the string, and the right part starts with a non-zero digit.

Thus, the approach would be:

- Find the middle position(s), check if the split is valid (right part starts with non-zero). If so, compute the sum.

- If not, look for the next possible split positions left and right of the middle where the right part starts with non-zero.

But how to handle that?

Alternatively, find all possible split positions near the middle (like up to a few positions left and right) where the right part starts with a non-zero digit, and compute their sums, then take the minimal.

But why would that work?

Because for very long numbers, the sum of two numbers of roughly equal length will be smaller than splitting into very unequal lengths. For example, 1234 and 567 (sum 1801) is better than 1 and 234567 (sum 234568).

So the minimal sum is likely achieved when the split is around the middle, and the right part starts with a non-zero.

Thus, the plan is:

1. Find the middle of the string (mid = l//2, perhaps).

2. Check split positions around mid (mid-1, mid, mid+1, etc.), but only those where the right part starts with non-zero.

3. For each valid split position in this vicinity, compute the sum.

4. The minimal sum among these candidates is the answer.

But how far from the middle do we need to check? For example, perhaps up to a certain distance (like 5 positions left and right) to cover possible cases where leading zeros in the right part are present.

Because if the middle is split into two parts, but the right part starts with zero, we need to find the next possible split to the left and right where the right part starts with non-zero.

But how to find those splits?

Alternatively, for each candidate split position around the middle, find the closest split positions to the left and right where the right part starts with non-zero. Then compute their sums.

But how to find those positions efficiently?

Alternatively, for the middle position, check if the split is valid. If not, move left until you find a valid split (or right). But this may not work because the split may be invalid in both directions.

Wait, but the problem statement says that there is at least one valid split. So for example, the split into 1 and l-1 digits is possible if the right part's first character is non-zero. But in cases where all possible split positions except the first one are invalid, like for '100...001', then the valid split is after the first character (left is '1', right is '00...001'? Wait no, the right part cannot start with zero. So the only valid split is after the last possible position where the right part starts with 1.

Wait, for example, '100001'. The possible split positions are after the first '1', but the right part is '00001' which starts with zero. So invalid. After the second '0' (position 1, 2, 3, 4?), the right part starts with 0. So the only valid split is after position 4: left is '10000', right is '1'. Sum is 10001. So even if the split is at the end, that's the only valid split.

So in such a case, the split is as far as possible to the right, which gives the minimal possible sum.

But how to handle such cases?

So, perhaps the approach is:

1. Iterate through all possible split positions in the middle region (like mid Â± some small number, say 5).

But for very long numbers, this might miss the correct split position.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the split positions closest to the middle that are valid. For example, find the first valid split position to the left of mid and the first valid split to the right of mid, and compare those.

But how to find those?

An alternative idea: the split positions that can give the minimal sum are those where the right part starts with a non-zero. So, the problem reduces to considering all split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero, and among these, find the split position that when the sum of left and right is minimized.

But even so, with a large number of split positions (like 1e5), the sum computation is O(l) per split, which is not feasible.

Thus, the key is to find the split positions where the sum is likely to be minimal and compute those sums.

Let's think about the sum of two numbers. The sum is the sum of their numeric values. So, to minimize the sum, we need to minimize the two numbers. Since the numbers are split from the original string, their lengths can vary.

For example, a split into two parts of length k and l-k. The sum is (a) + (b). To minimize this, we need a and b to be as small as possible.

The numbers a and b are determined by their digits. The leading digits play a big role. So, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when the split is such that the right part is as small as possible. For example, splitting as early as possible (to make the right part as long as possible?), but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, the split must be at a position where the right part is as small as possible, given the leading digits. But how?

Alternatively, the minimal sum is achieved when the split is such that the two numbers are as small as possible. So, perhaps the split where the right part starts with the smallest possible digit. For example, if there's a split position where the right part starts with 1, that's better than one that starts with 9.

But in that case, among all split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero, we can look for the earliest occurrence of a minimal leading digit. For example, the right part starts with 1, then 2, etc. But this may not be the case, as the sum depends on the entire digits.

Alternatively, the sum can be minimized by choosing the split that leads to the smallest possible first differing digit. For example, in the string '1234567', splitting into 1234 and 567 (sum 1801) is better than other splits. Here, the right part starts with 5. But maybe other splits where the right part starts with smaller digits would give even smaller sum. But in the example, the possible splits are after 1 (123456 +7=123463), which is larger than 1801.

Thus, the split near the middle is better.

So, perhaps the optimal split is somewhere around the middle of the string. So the approach is to check all split positions near the middle (like a window of 5 positions left and right) where the right part starts with a non-zero digit, compute their sums, and choose the minimal one.

But how to handle cases where the middle split is invalid (right part starts with zero), but there are valid splits a few positions away?

For example, the original string is '1000000000000...00001'. The middle split may be invalid, but the valid splits are near the ends.

But in that case, the minimal sum is achieved by splitting as early as possible (left part is 1, right part is 00...0001 which is invalid) or as late as possible (left part is 100...000, right part is 1, sum is 100...000 + 1 = 100...001).

So in such a case, the minimal sum is achieved by splitting as late as possible, but the right part must start with a non-zero.

So how to handle such cases?

Another observation: the right part must start with a non-zero digit. So, all possible split positions are those where s[i] (the first character of the right part) is non-zero.

So, the valid split positions are the indices i (1-based?) where s[i] is not zero.

Wait, for split after position k (0-based, the split is between index k and k+1). The right part starts with s[k+1]. So for the split to be valid, s[k+1] must not be zero.

So, all split positions k (0 <=k < l-1) where s[k+1] is not zero.

So, the valid splits are those positions where the next character is non-zero.

Thus, the approach is to collect all possible split positions where s[k+1] is non-zero, and then compute their sums.

But again, for each of these split positions, computing the sum is O(l) time. If there are O(l) valid splits, the time is O(l^2), which is not feasible for l=1e5.

So we need to find a way to compute the sum of the two parts for all possible split positions in O(1) time per split, or O(1) time overall.

But how?

Alternative idea: the sum of two numbers can be represented as a string. But to find the minimal sum, perhaps we can compare the sums lexicographically without computing the actual numeric value.

But comparing two sums lexicographically is not straightforward. For example, 1000 + 999 = 1999, and 999 + 999 = 1998. The minimal sum is the latter, but lex order would compare the strings.

But perhaps, the minimal sum can be determined by the lengths of the sum. For example, a sum with fewer digits is better. If two sums have the same length, then the lexicographical order can be used.

But how to compute the sum lengths for each possible split?

The sum's length can be up to max(len(left), len(right)) + 1. For example, if left has m digits and right has n digits, the sum can have at most max(m, n)+1 digits.

So, for split positions where the left and right parts are of lengths m and n, the sum's length is either max(m, n) or max(m, n)+1.

So, to find the minimal sum, we can first find the split positions where the sum's length is minimal, and among those, find the lexicographically smallest sum.

But how to compute the sum's length for each split?

Alternatively, the sum's length is determined by the maximum of m and n. So for split positions where the maximum is as small as possible, the sum is likely to be minimal.

For example, splitting the string into two parts as balanced as possible (m and n differ by at most 1) will give the smallest maximum of m and n, thus possibly the sum's length is minimal.

Thus, the minimal sum is likely to come from splits that balance the lengths of the two parts. So, we can focus on split positions near the middle of the string where the right part starts with a non-zero digit.

So, the steps could be:

1. Find the middle split positions (like mid = len(s) // 2).

2. Check split positions around mid where the right part starts with non-zero. For example, check mid-2, mid-1, mid, mid+1, mid+2, etc.

3. For each valid split in this window, compute the sum.

4. The minimal sum among these is the answer.

If there are no valid splits near the middle (e.g., the middle is all zeros), then we need to look for the closest valid splits towards the start or end.

But how to handle this?

Another idea: For the given string, collect all the split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero digit. Among these, find the ones that are closest to the middle (to balance the lengths). Then, compute their sums and choose the minimal.

But how to find the split positions closest to the middle?

We can iterate from the middle towards the start and end, checking for valid split positions. Once found, collect a few of them (like up to 5 on each side) and compute their sums.

This way, even if the middle is invalid, we can find valid splits near it.

So, the steps are:

1. Generate all possible split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero digit.

2. For each such split position, compute the sum of the two parts.

3. Find the minimal sum.

But again, the problem is step 2's time.

So, the crux is to find a way to compare the sums of the two parts without converting them to integers and adding, which would take O(l) time per split.

Hmm. So the sum of two numbers as strings can be computed as follows:

To add two numbers represented as strings:

- reverse them so that the least significant digit comes first.

- add digit by digit, keeping track of carry.

But for two numbers of m and n digits, the sum takes O(max(m, n)) time.

But with l up to 1e5, this is O(l) per split. If we have up to 10 split positions to check, then O(10*l) is manageable.

So, the plan is:

- Collect a small number (like up to 20) of split positions around the middle where the right part is valid (starts with non-zero).

- For each of these split positions, compute the sum as a string.

- Compare the sum strings lexicographically (since the minimal sum is the lexicographically smallest when they are of the same length, and the shortest possible length is better).

Wait, but how to compare sums when they are of different lengths? For example, a sum with 3 digits (like '999') is better than a sum with 4 digits (like '1000').

Thus, the comparison between two sums can first check their lengths. If the lengths are different, the shorter one is better. If the lengths are the same, then compare lex order.

So, for each candidate split, compute the sum as a string, and then compare these strings according to the above rules to find the minimal sum.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Find all split positions where the right part starts with a non-zero digit. But since we can't check all of them, we need to collect a few candidates around the middle.

2. To collect these candidates:

   a. Start from the middle of the string and move left and right, checking each position until we find a few valid splits.

3. For each valid split in this collection, compute the sum as a string.

4. Compare all these sums and choose the minimal.

But how to collect the valid splits near the middle?

Let's implement this.

For example, for the string '1234567' (length 7), the middle is at position 3 (split into 4 and 3 digits). The split is valid since the right part starts with '5' which is non-zero. So compute the sum here.

For the string '101', the middle is at position 1 (split into 2 and 1 digits). The right part starts with '1', so valid. Sum is '10' + '1' = 11.

But how to handle cases where the middle split is invalid?

For example, string '10000000000000000000000000000000000001' (length 40). The middle is at 20. The right part starts with '0', so invalid. So, we look for the closest valid splits to the left and right of position 20.

Looking left from 20: check positions 19, 18, etc., until we find a split where the right part starts with non-zero. Similarly, look right from 20: positions 21, 22, etc.

Once a valid split is found in each direction, collect those as candidates.

But how many candidates do we need to check? For example, collect up to 5 candidates to the left and right of the middle.

Once collected, compute their sums and choose the minimal.

Thus, the algorithm is:

- Find all valid split positions (k) where s[k] (the first digit of the right part) is non-zero. But since checking all is O(l), which is manageable for l=1e5, but the sum computation is O(l) per split.

But if we collect a small number of candidates (like up to 20 split positions), then the total time is O(20*l) = 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.

So, how to collect the candidates?

1. Start at the middle of the string (mid = (l-1)//2).

2. Check positions from mid - 2 to mid + 2, and collect any valid splits.

3. If none are found in that range, expand the search towards the start and end until some valid splits are found.

But how to code this?

Alternatively, we can find the best possible splits by checking all valid splits in a window around the middle. Let's say, check 10 splits to the left and 10 to the right of the middle.

But how to code this?

Alternatively, iterate from the middle towards the start and end, and collect the first few valid splits found.

Another approach: find all valid splits near the middle (like up to 20 positions left and right), and among those, compute the sums.

But to find those splits, we can:

Loop i from max(0, mid - 50) to min(l-2, mid +50), and check if s[i+1] is non-zero. Collect all such positions, then take the ones closest to the middle.

But for a string of length 1e5, this is manageable (check 100 positions), and among them, collect the valid ones.

Alternatively, collect all valid splits within a certain range around the middle, like 100 positions to the left and right. Then, for those splits, compute the sum and find the minimal.

But for the worst case where all splits are valid, this could still require 200 splits, each requiring O(l) time. For l=1e5, this is 2e7 operations, which is acceptable for a 2-second time limit.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

So, the steps are:

- Precompute all valid split positions (positions where the right part starts with non-zero).

- Among these, select the ones closest to the middle of the string (since those splits would yield the minimal sum).

- For each of these selected splits, compute the sum of the left and right parts as strings.

- Compare all these sums (based on length and lex order) to find the minimal one.

Thus, the code would:

1. Iterate through the string to find all valid split positions.

   For each split position k (0-based, where the split is after k characters, so left is s[0..k], right is s[k+1..l-1]).

   The split is valid if s[k+1] != '0'.

   Collect these positions in a list.

2. If the list is empty, which the problem says is impossible.

3. For each split position in the list, compute the sum of left and right.

   But this is O(l) per split, which is not feasible for a large list.

   So, to avoid this, we need to find a way to limit the number of split positions to check.

Thus, the approach is to collect a small number of split positions (like up to 20) around the middle, compute their sums, and choose the minimal.

So, how to collect these split positions?

Option:

- Find the split position that is closest to the middle of the string.

But this may not be possible if the middle split is invalid. So, we can search to the left and right of the middle for the first valid split.

Once found, collect a few (like 5) splits around that position.

Thus, the code would:

Compute mid = l // 2.

Then, look for the first valid split to the left and right of mid.

For example:

start from mid and expand in both directions until we find a valid split.

Once found, collect up to 5 splits in each direction.

But this could be time-consuming for some cases.

Alternative idea: find all valid splits and select those that are closest to the middle.

But how to find the closest to the middle?

For example, for a list of valid split positions, compute their distance from the middle and pick the ones with minimal distance.

But for a string of length 1e5, collecting all valid splits is O(l), which is manageable.

Once we have all valid splits, we can sort them by their distance from the middle and take the first few (like 20) closest ones.

But for l=1e5, this could take O(l) time to collect the valid splits, which is acceptable.

Once the valid splits are collected, we can sort them by their proximity to the middle and select the top 20, then compute their sums.

Thus, the code steps would be:

1. Iterate through the string once to collect all valid split positions (positions k where s[k+1] is not '0').

2. If no valid splits (impossible), return something.

3. For each valid split, compute its distance from the middle (abs(k - mid)).

4. Sort the valid splits by their distance, then select the top 20 (or so) with the smallest distances.

5. For each of these splits, compute the sum of left and right.

6. Find the minimal sum among these.

But step 1 is O(l), which is acceptable.

Step 3 and 4 are O(m log m), where m is the number of valid splits. For m up to l, this is O(l log l), which for l=1e5 is manageable.

Steps 5 and 6 are O(k * l), where k is the number of candidates (like 20). So total time is O(20*l) = 2e6 operations.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

But how to implement the sum of two large numbers as strings.

Implementing a function to add two large numbers as strings:

For two numbers a and b, represented as strings, we can compute their sum as follows:

- Reverse both strings.

- Pad the shorter one with zeros to match the length.

- Add digit by digit, keeping track of carry.

- Reverse the result to get the sum.

For example:

a = '1234' --> reversed is '4321'

b = '567' --> reversed is '765' --> padded to '7650' (length 4).

Add:

4 + 7 + 0 = 11 â†’ digit 1, carry 1.

3 + 6 + 1 = 10 â†’ digit 0, carry 1.

2 + 5 + 1 = 8 â†’ digit 8, carry 0.

1 + 0 + 0 = 1 â†’ digit 1.

Sum reversed is 1801.

Which matches the example.

So, the function to add two strings would look like:

def add_str(a, b):

    # Reverse a and b

    a_rev = a[::-1]

    b_rev = b[::-1]

    # Pad with zeros

    max_len = max(len(a_rev), len(b_rev))

    a_rev = a_rev.ljust(max_len, '0')

    b_rev = b_rev.ljust(max_len, '0')

    carry = 0

    res = []

    for i in range(max_len):

        digit_a = int(a_rev[i])

        digit_b = int(b_rev[i])

        total = digit_a + digit_b + carry

        res.append(str(total % 10))

        carry = total // 10

    if carry >0:

        res.append(str(carry))

    # Reverse back and remove leading zeros

    sum_str = ''.join(res[::-1]).lstrip('0')

    # Handle case where sum is zero

    return sum_str if sum_str else '0'

Wait, but in the problem statement, the sum can't have leading zeros, but since the input parts are non-zero leading, their sum can't be zero unless both are zero, which is impossible.

But the code handles leading zeros by stripping them, and returns '0' if the sum is zero.

But in our problem, the two numbers being added are both positive and non-zero, so their sum is at least 2 (like 1+1). But no, if one part is 1 and the other is 0, but the other part can't be zero. So sum is at least 1.

But in code, the function returns the sum as a string without leading zeros.

Thus, this function should work.

But for very large strings (like 1e5 digits), reversing them and padding could take O(n) time. But since for each candidate split, the left and right parts are up to 1e5 digits each, and we're processing up to 20 candidates, the total time is O(20 * 1e5) = 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.

Thus, the plan is:

1. Read l and the string s.

2. Collect all valid split positions (k) where s[k+1] != '0'.

3. If no valid splits, return error (but problem says there's at least one).

4. For each valid split, compute the distance from the middle (mid = (l-1) // 2).

5. Sort the valid splits by their distance, then select the top 20 (or so) candidates.

6. For each candidate split:

   a. Split s into left and right.

   b. Add them as strings using the add_str function.

   c. Keep track of the minimal sum.

7. Output the minimal sum.

But wait, step 5: we can sort the valid splits by their absolute distance from mid, then take the first 20 closest splits.

But this requires that the valid splits are stored in a list, which could be O(1e5) elements. For l=1e5, but in the worst case, like a string of '101010...10', the valid splits are every other position, so O(1e5) split positions. Sorting that would take O(1e5 log 1e5) time, which is around 1e6 operations, which is manageable.

But in practice, the code may need to handle this.

Alternatively, to avoid sorting the entire list, we can collect the top 20 closest splits by scanning the list once and keeping track of the smallest distances.

But for the purpose of code simplicity, it's easier to sort.

Thus, the code would:

Collect all valid splits in a list.

Sort the list based on the absolute difference between the split position and mid.

Then take the first 20 elements (or less if there are fewer).

Then, for each of these splits, compute the sum, and track the minimal sum.

Thus, this approach should work.

Now, let's test this logic against the examples.

First example:

Input:

7

1234567

Valid splits are positions where the right part starts with non-zero. So for positions 0 to 6-1=5 (since split is between k and k+1, k can be 0 to l-2=5).

s[k+1] is the first digit of the right part.

For this example, the string is '1234567'.

All positions k+1 (1 to 6) are digits '2','3','4','5','6','7'â€”all non-zero. So all splits are valid.

So valid_splits is [0,1,2,3,4,5].

mid is (7-1)//2 = 3.

So for each split position, the distance to mid is |k-3|.

So sorted valid splits by distance:

3 (distance 0), 2 (1),4 (1), 1 (2),5 (2),0 (3).

The top 6 are considered, but we take the first 20 (but in this case, 6).

For each candidate split:

split 3: left is '1234', right is '567' sum 1801.

split 2: left is '123', right is '4567' sum 4690.

split 4: left is '12345', right is '67' sum 12412.

Thus, the minimal is 1801.

The code will select split 3 and compute the sum.

Other splits have larger sums.

Thus, the code should work.

Second example:

3

101.

Valid splits are positions where s[k+1] is not zero.

The string is '101'.

Possible splits are after position 0 (right part is '01', starts with 0 â†’ invalid), after position 1 (right part is '1', starts with 1 â†’ valid).

So valid_splits is [1].

mid is (3-1)//2 =1.

split after 1: left '10' (10), right '1' (1) sum 11.

Thus, code works.

Another test case: '101'.

Another possible split after position 0 is invalid.

Another example: '10000001'.

Valid splits are those where the right part starts with '0' (invalid) or '1'.

The split positions where right part starts with '1' are possible. For example, if the string is '10000001', the valid splits are after position 6 (right part is '1').

Thus, code will find that split and sum 1000000 +1 = 1000001.

But what if the string is '10000000000000000000000000000000000001' (length 40).

The middle split is after position 19, but the right part starts with 0. So code will look for splits near the middle. The next valid split is after position 38 (right part is '1') â†’ sum 100...00 + 1.

Thus, code will find that split and return 100...001.

Thus, code works.

Thus, the code approach is correct.

Now, the code.

First, read l and s.

Then, collect valid_splits = [k for k in 0..l-2 if s[k+1] != '0'].

Then, if len(valid_splits) ==0: impossible.

Else, compute mid = (l-1)//2.

Sort valid_splits by |k - mid|.

Take up to 20 splits (or all if less than 20).

For each split, compute left = s[:k+1], right = s[k+1:].

Sum them using the add_str function.

Find the minimal sum.

So, code:

Implement add_str.

But in Python, handling very long strings can be slow if not optimized.

But for the code to work within the time constraints, we need to implement the add_str function efficiently.

But for Python, even with 1e5-digit strings, reversing and processing them is manageable.

But to optimize, perhaps we can process the strings without reversing.

Alternatively, we can compute the sum by iterating from the end of the strings to the beginning, keeping track of carry.

But the code is similar.

Thus, the code:

Read l, s.

valid_splits = list of k where s[k+1] != '0'.

if no valid splits: impossible.

mid = (l-1) // 2.

sorted_splits = sorted(valid_splits, key=lambda x: abs(x - mid)).

candidates = sorted_splits[:20] (or all if less than 20).

For each k in candidates:

left = s[:k+1]

right = s[k+1:]

sum_str = add_str(left, right)

keep track of the minimal sum_str.

Then, output the minimal sum_str.

The key part is the add_str function.

Implementing add_str:

def add_str(a, b):

    # Reverse both strings for easier processing from least to most significant digit.

    a_reversed = a[::-1]

    b_reversed = b[::-1]

    max_len = max(len(a_reversed), len(b_reversed))

    carry = 0

    result = []

    for i in range(max_len):

        digit_a = int(a_reversed[i]) if i < len(a_reversed) else 0

        digit_b = int(b_reversed[i]) if i < len(b_reversed) else 0

        total = digit_a + digit_b + carry

        result.append(str(total % 10))

        carry = total // 10

    if carry > 0:

        result.append(str(carry))

    # Reverse back to get the correct order, then remove leading zeros.

    sum_str = ''.join(reversed(result)).lstrip('0')

    return sum_str if sum_str else '0'

This function should correctly compute the sum.

Thus, the code is:

Read l, s.

Compute valid_splits.

If none, impossible.

Sort valid_splits.

Take up to 20 candidates.

Compute sum for each.

Track the minimal sum.

Now, code:

But how to compare the sums?

When comparing two sums, first compare their lengths. If lengths are different, the shorter is better. If lengths are the same, compare lex order.

So, during the processing of candidates, for each sum_str, we need to compare it with the current minimal sum.

Thus, the code can track the minimal sum as a tuple (len(sum_str), sum_str), and update it when a better candidate is found.

Thus, the code:

Initialize min_sum as None.

For each candidate split in candidates:

    left = s[:k+1]

    right = s[k+1:]

    sum_str = add_str(left, right)

    current = (len(sum_str), sum_str)

    if min_sum is None or current < min_sum:

        min_sum = current

Finally, print(min_sum[1]).

Thus, the code.

Putting it all together:

Read the input.

Collect valid splits.

Sort by distance.

Take up to 20 candidates.

Compute sums and track the minimal.

Now, code:

But for Python, the code:

l = int(input())

s = input().strip()

valid_splits = []

for k in range(len(s)-1):

    if s[k+1] != '0':

        valid_splits.append(k)

mid = (l-1) // 2

valid_splits.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x - mid))

candidates = valid_splits[:20]

def add_str(a, b):

    a_rev = a[::-1]

    b_rev = b[::-1]

    max_len = max(len(a_rev), len(b_rev))

    carry = 0

    result = []

    for i in range(max_len):

        digit_a = int(a_rev[i]) if i < len(a_rev) else 0

        digit_b = int(b_rev[i]) if i < len(b_rev) else 0

        total = digit_a + digit_b + carry

        result.append(str(total % 10))

        carry = total // 10

    if carry:

        result.append(str(carry))

    sum_str = ''.join(reversed(result)).lstrip('0')

    return sum_str if sum_str else '0'

min_sum = None

for k in candidates:

    left = s[:k+1]

    right = s[k+1:]

    sum_ = add_str(left, right)

    current = (len(sum_), sum_)

    if min_sum is None or current < min_sum:

        min_sum = current

print(min_sum[1])

But wait, in the case where there are multiple candidates, like 20, but some of them have the same sum length but lex order.

This code will correctly select the minimal sum.

Testing the first example:

After sorting, the valid splits are ordered by distance to mid (3). The first split is 3, which is the correct split.

The code computes '1234' + '567' = 1801.

In the second example, the code selects the only valid split, sum is 11.

Another test case: '1010'.

Valid splits are positions where the next character is not 0. So positions:

k=0: s[1] is '0' â†’ invalid.

k=1: s[2] is '1' â†’ valid.

k=2: s[3] is '0' â†’ invalid.

So valid_splits is [1].

Mid is (4-1)//2=1. So the split is at 1: left '10', right '10'. sum is 20.

The code will output 20.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, this code should handle all cases correctly.
