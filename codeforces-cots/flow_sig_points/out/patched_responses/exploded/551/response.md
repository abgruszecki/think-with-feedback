Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the problem is about Vasya, the cashier, who wants to take as many smoke breaks as possible during his workday. The day is L minutes long, and each break is a minutes. But he can't take breaks while serving customers. So we need to find the maximum number of breaks he can take between the customer service times.

First, let's understand the input. The input gives us n customers, each arriving at time t_i and taking l_i minutes to serve. The customers are given in order, and it's guaranteed that they don't overlap. So the first customer starts at t_0, ends at t_0 + l_0. The next customer starts at t_1, which is >= t_0 + l_0, and so on. Also, after the last customer, there's time until L.

The key here is to find all the available time slots where Vasya isn't serving customers, and see how many a-minute breaks can fit into each of those slots. The sum of all possible breaks in each slot is the answer.

So how do we approach this? Let's break it down.

The possible time slots where breaks can be taken are:

1. Before the first customer arrives. The time here is from 0 to t_0. The length is t_0 - 0 = t_0.
2. Between two consecutive customers. The start is the end time of the previous customer (t_i + l_i), and the end is the start time of the next customer (t_{i+1}). The length here is t_{i+1} - (t_i + l_i).
3. After the last customer ends, until the end of the workday (L). The start is t_n + l_n, end is L. Length is L - (t_n + l_n).

For each of these intervals, we calculate how many a-minute breaks can fit. The maximum number of breaks per interval is (length of interval) // a.

But wait, how do we handle the case when there are zero customers? Then the entire interval is from 0 to L. So the number of breaks is L // a.

So the plan is:

- Sort the customers (if they aren't already sorted, but according to the problem statement, the input is given in order such that t_i + l_i <= t_{i+1}, so the list is already sorted in the order of arrival. So perhaps we can process them in order as given.)

But wait, looking at the input constraints: the problem says that "it is guaranteed that t_i + l_i ≤ t_{i+1} and t_n + l_n ≤ L". So the customers are given in order, and their service times do not overlap. So we can process them in the order given.

So the steps are:

1. Check the time before the first customer. If there are no customers, then it's the entire L. Otherwise, the first customer's t_0 is the start, so the available time is from 0 to t_0. The duration is t_0.

2. For each pair of consecutive customers, calculate the available time between them. For i from 0 to n-2: the available time is t_{i+1} - (t_i + l_i).

3. Check the time after the last customer. The available time is L - (t_{n-1} + l_{n-1}).

For each of these intervals, compute how many a-minute breaks fit. Sum all these.

So the algorithm is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.

But how do we handle the edge cases?

For example, when n=0, there are no customers. So the entire time is available. So the answer is L//a.

Another example: when a break is exactly the length of the available interval. Then 1 break is possible.

So the approach seems solid.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

Read n, L, a.

If n is 0, then the answer is L//a.

Else:

Compute the initial available time before the first customer: t_0.

Then for each customer, from 0 to n-1:

Wait, no. Wait, for the first customer, their start time is t_0. The available time before them is t_0 - 0. So that's the first interval.

Then for customers 1 to n-1, the available time between customer i-1 and customer i is t_i - (t_{i-1} + l_{i-1}).

Wait, no. Because the next customer's start time is >= the previous end. So the available time between customer i-1 and i is t_i - (prev_end). prev_end is t_{i-1} + l_{i-1}.

Yes.

Then after the last customer, the available time is L - (t_{n-1} + l_{n-1}).

So the steps are:

Initialize breaks = 0.

prev_end = 0.

For each customer in the list:

   available = t_i - prev_end

   breaks += available // a

   prev_end = t_i + l_i

After processing all customers, check the remaining time:

available = L - prev_end

breaks += available // a

So yes. That's the plan.

But the customers are given in order. So the code can process them one by one.

So the code in Python would be:

Read n, L, a.

if n ==0:

   print(L//a)

else:

   breaks =0

   prev_end =0

   for each customer in the list:

       ti, li = customer's data

       available = ti - prev_end

       breaks += available //a

       prev_end = ti + li

   # handle after last customer

   available = L - prev_end

   breaks += available //a

   print(breaks)

But how to read the customers? For n=0, the code skips the loop.

In the problem statement, the input after the first line has n lines. So for n=0, there are no lines after the first.

So in code:

We need to read the first line, then read n lines.

In Python:

import sys

n, L, a = map(int, input().split())

prev_end =0

count =0

for _ in range(n):

    ti, li = map(int, input().split())

    available = ti - prev_end

    count += available // a

    prev_end = ti + li

available = L - prev_end

count += available //a

print(count)

Wait, but when n is zero, the loop doesn't run, and then the available is L -0, which is L. So count += L//a. So even if n is zero, the code works.

Wait, let's test for the second sample input:

Sample 2:

Input:

0 5 2

The code:

n=0, L=5, a=2.

prev_end is 0.

The loop runs 0 times.

available =5-0=5.

count =5//2 =2. So output is 2. Correct.

Another sample:

Sample 1:

Input:

2 11 3

0 1

1 1

So:

prev_end starts at 0.

First customer: ti=0, li=1.

available is 0-0=0. So count +=0.

prev_end becomes 0+1=1.

Second customer: ti=1, li=1.

available is 1-1=0. count +=0.

prev_end becomes 1+1=2.

After loop:

available is 11-2=9. 9//3=3. So total count is 0+0+3=3. Correct.

Third sample:

Input:

1 3 2

1 2

prev_end starts at 0.

Processing customer ti=1, li=2.

available is 1-0=1. 1//2=0. count is 0.

prev_end becomes 1+2=3.

After loop, available is 3-3=0. 0//2=0. total 0.

Which is correct.

So the code works.

Now, what about edge cases?

For example, a =1. All possible intervals can be divided by a=1, so the count is the sum of all available time.

Another case: when available time is exactly divisible by a. For example, available is a * k, then it's k.

But what if available is zero? Like between two consecutive customers with no gap. Then no breaks.

So the code seems correct.

Now, considering the constraints.

n can be up to 1e5. The code reads n lines, which is manageable in Python. But in Python, reading input with input() for 1e5 lines may be slow. So for faster input, perhaps read all lines at once.

But for 1e5 lines, using input() in a loop is acceptable in Python? Well, in practice, it's manageable, but to optimize, we can read via sys.stdin.

But in code submission, for the problem, let's see.

The code as written reads n lines with input() in a loop. For n=1e5, each iteration is O(1), so it's O(n), which is acceptable. But in Python, using input() for 1e5 lines is slow because each call to input() has overhead. So to optimize, we can read all the input at once.

So perhaps read from sys.stdin.buffer.read(), split into tokens, then process.

Let's modify the code to read all data at once.

Yes. To optimize for speed, we can read all input into a buffer, split into tokens, and process them as integers.

In Python, the code would look like:

import sys

data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))
ptr =0

n = data[ptr]
L = data[ptr+1]
a = data[ptr+2]
ptr +=3

prev_end =0
count=0

for _ in range(n):
    ti = data[ptr]
    li = data[ptr+1]
    ptr +=2
    available = ti - prev_end
    count += available //a
    prev_end = ti + li

available = L - prev_end
count += available //a

print(count)

This approach is faster, especially for large n. Because reading all data in one go is more efficient than multiple input() calls.

This code should handle n up to 1e5 efficiently.

Now, test cases:

Sample 1:

Input lines:

2 11 3

0 1

1 1

The data list after reading is [2,11,3,0,1,1,1].

Processing:

ptr starts at 0.

n=2, L=11, a=3. ptr becomes 3.

Loop for 2 iterations:

First iteration:

ti = data[3] =0, li=data[4]=1. ptr becomes 5.

available=0-0=0. count 0. prev_end 1.

Second iteration:

ti=data[5]=1, li=data[6]=1. ptr becomes7.

available=1-1=0. count 0. prev_end 2.

Then available=11-2=9. 9//3=3. count becomes 3.

Sample 2:

Input is 0 5 2. data is [0,5,2].

n=0, so loop doesn't run. available=5-0=5. 5//2=2. count=2.

Sample 3:

n=1, L=3, a=2.

Data is [1,3,2,1,2].

ptr=3, ti=1, li=2.

available=1-0=1. 1//2=0. prev_end=3.

available after: 3-3=0. 0//2=0. total 0.

All correct.

Thus, the code should work and be efficient.
