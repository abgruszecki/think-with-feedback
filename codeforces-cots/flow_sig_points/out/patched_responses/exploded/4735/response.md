<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the problem carefully again.

The problem is about counting coprime arrays. A coprime array is one where the GCD of all elements is 1. For each i from 1 to k, I need to compute the number of arrays of size n where each element is between 1 and i, inclusive, and the array is coprime. Then, sum all (b_i XOR i) mod 1e9+7, where b_i is the count modulo 1e9+7.

Constraints are n and k up to 2e6. So the solution needs to be O(k) or O(k log k) time. Otherwise, it's going to be too slow.

Hmm. Let's think about inclusion-exclusion here. The total possible arrays for a given i is i^n. But we need to subtract those arrays whose GCD is greater than 1. How to compute that efficiently?

Wait, the standard inclusion-exclusion approach for coprime counts is to use Möbius function. Because the inclusion-exclusion over the divisors can be handled with Möbius inversion.

The formula is: the number of coprime arrays is the sum over d from 1 to i of μ(d) * f(d), where f(d) is the number of arrays where all elements are divisible by d. But since the GCD must be exactly 1, we can use Möbius function here.

Wait, the Möbius function comes into play here because of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that the number of arrays with GCD exactly 1 is equal to the sum_{d=1 to i} μ(d) * g(d), where g(d) is the number of arrays where all elements are divisible by d. Because when d is 1, it's the total number of arrays. For d>1, we subtract those that have all elements divisible by d, but then add back in multiples, etc.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as the sum_{d=1}^i μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n. Because for each d, the number of arrays where all elements are divisible by d is equal to the number of elements in [1,i] divisible by d, which is floor(i/d), and each element in the array has to be a multiple of d. So for all elements, there are (floor(i/d))^n such arrays. But since the GCD must be exactly 1, we use Möbius inversion here. Wait, no. The Möbius function here helps us count the inclusion-exclusion correctly. So the correct formula is:

b_i = sum_{d=1}^i μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n

Wait, no. Wait, the Möbius function is used here in the inclusion-exclusion to compute the number of arrays where the GCD is exactly 1. The sum over d divides the GCD, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The total number of arrays where all elements are divisible by d is (m)^n, where m is the number of multiples of d in [1, i], which is floor(i/d). But the GCD of all elements must be a multiple of d. However, the GCD could be d, 2d, etc. So to find the number of arrays where GCD is exactly 1, we can use Möbius inversion. The formula is:

number of coprime arrays = sum_{d=1}^i μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n

Because for each d, if d divides the GCD of the array, then the count is (floor(i/d))^n. But the Möbius function here accounts for inclusion-exclusion. So this sum over d (with μ(d)) gives exactly the count of arrays where GCD is 1.

Yes, that's the right approach. So for each i, we need to compute this sum. But how to compute this efficiently for all i up to k?

The problem is that for each i, calculating the sum over d from 1 to i of μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n. However, if n is up to 2e6 and k is up to 2e6, and for each i, you need to iterate up to i terms, this would be O(k^2), which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter approach. Let's think about precomputing something for all possible d and i, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

Let me reorganize the sum for b_i. Let's note that floor(i/d) can be written as q, which is the integer division of i by d. So for each d, when q is fixed, there's a range of i where floor(i/d) = q. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, for each d, we can compute the contribution of μ(d) to all i where d ≤ i. For a fixed d, μ(d) is non-zero only if d is square-free. So for each d, we can compute for all multiples of d, the term μ(d) multiplied by (floor(i/d))^n. Wait, but each i is part of multiple d's. So this approach seems tricky.

Wait, but the formula for b_i is sum_{d=1}^i μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n. Let's fix d and think about how (floor(i/d))^n changes as i increases. For a fixed d, floor(i/d) increases by 1 each time i increases by d. So for each d, the contribution to b_i is μ(d) * q^n, where q is floor(i/d). But for multiple i's, this q is the same.

But calculating this for each d and i up to k would be O(k) per d, which again is O(k^2) for all d's, which is not feasible.

So perhaps we can precompute for each possible q (from 1 to max_q, which is k), and for each d where floor(i/d) = q, accumulate μ(d) * q^n into the sum for i.

Alternatively, we can consider that for each d, the term μ(d) contributes to all i >= d. For each i, the sum is over d <= i. So for each i, we need to sum μ(d) multiplied by (floor(i/d))^n.

But even with that, how to compute this efficiently?

Another approach: note that floor(i/d) is equal to the number of times d fits into i. So for each d, the possible q is floor(i/d) which can be up to floor(k/d). For each q, there is a range of i where floor(i/d) = q. So for each d, the possible q's are from 1 to floor(k/d). For each q, the i's that correspond to this q for d are i in [d*q, d*(q+1)-1]. So for each d, the contribution of μ(d)*q^n is added to all i in this interval.

But how can we precompute this for all d and q, then aggregate the sum for each i?

The idea is to precompute for each possible q and d, the range of i's where floor(i/d) = q, and then for each such i, add μ(d) * q^n to b_i. Then, for all i, sum these contributions.

But how to implement this efficiently.

Let me think. For each d from 1 to k:

- Compute μ(d). If μ(d) is 0 (because d has a squared prime factor), skip this d.
- For q from 1 to q_max (where q_max is floor(k/d)), compute the value μ(d) * q^n.
- Then, for the interval [d*q, min(d*(q+1)-1, k)], add this value to all b_i in that interval.

But if we process each d and each q for d, then for each i, we can accumulate the sum from all d and q that contribute to it.

But processing this directly would be O(k) operations for each d, leading to O(k log k) total operations. Because for d=1, q ranges up to k, but for d=2, q up to k/2, and so on. The sum over d of floor(k/d) is O(k log k), which for k=2e6 is manageable, as 2e6 * log(2e6) is around 2e6*20 = 4e7, which should be manageable.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute the Möbius function for all d up to k.

2. For each d from 1 to k:

   a. If μ(d) is 0, skip.

   b. For q from 1 to q_max = floor(k/d):

      i. Compute q_power = q^n mod MOD.

      ii. Compute the contribution term: mu * q_power.

      iii. Determine the interval [L, R] where i is in [d*q, min(d*(q+1)-1, k)].

      iv. Add this term to the prefix sum array for the interval [L, R]. This can be done using a difference array approach: add term to L, subtract from R+1.

3. After processing all d and q, compute the prefix sum array to get the sum for each i, which is b_i.

4. Then, compute the sum of (b_i XOR i) for i from 1 to k, modulo MOD.

But wait, how to compute q_power efficiently? Since n can be up to 2e6, and q can be up to k (2e6), we need to compute q^n mod MOD. However, for each q, computing q^n can be done with exponentiation by squaring, but for q up to 2e6, this might be O(k log n), which is 2e6 * 20 = 4e7 operations. But that's manageable. Alternatively, precompute all possible q's up to k, and compute q^n mod MOD for each q. But if n is 2e6, and q is 2e6, then for each q, exponentiation is O(log n) time. So 2e6 * 20 is 4e7 steps, which is acceptable.

But how to precompute all q^n mod MOD for q up to 2e6?

Alternatively, precompute pow_q = [pow(q, n, MOD) for q in 0..k]. But even better, we can compute this array once. For example, precompute an array where pow_q[q] is q^n mod MOD. Then, for each d and q, we can get q_power as pow_q[q].

So steps:

Precompute pow_table where pow_table[q] = pow(q, n, MOD) for q from 0 to k.

But wait, when d is up to k, q is up to floor(k/d). The maximum possible q is when d=1, q=k. So for q up to k, yes.

So precompute pow_table.

Now, the algorithm steps:

- Precompute μ(d) for d from 1 to k.

- Precompute pow_table[q] for q from 0 to k.

- Initialize a difference array delta of size k+2, initialized to 0.

- For each d in 1..k:

   if μ(d) == 0: continue

   mu = μ(d)

   max_q = k // d

   for q in 1..max_q:

      contribution = mu * pow_table[q]

      contribution %= MOD

      L = d * q

      R = d * (q+1) - 1

      if R > k:

          R = k

      delta[L] = (delta[L] + contribution) % MOD

      if R+1 <= k:

          delta[R+1] = (delta[R+1] - contribution) % MOD

- Compute the prefix sum array b, where b[i] is the sum of delta[1..i], mod MOD.

- Then, for each i from 1 to k, compute (b[i] XOR i) and sum all these, mod MOD.

Wait, but the problem says that b_i is the number of coprime arrays modulo MOD. So the delta array approach accumulates the sum for each i. Let's see:

Each d and q contributes to a range of i's. So for each i in [L, R], add mu * q^n to their sum. The delta array approach allows us to do this in O(1) per interval. Then, after processing all intervals, we compute the prefix sum to get the sum for each i.

Yes. So the total time for this is O(k log k) for all d and q, plus O(k) for the prefix sum and processing.

But how to compute the Möbius function for all d up to k?

Yes. Let's implement the sieve of Eratosthenes to compute μ(d) for all d up to k.

The standard approach for computing Möbius function is:

- Initialize mu[1] = 1.

- For each prime p, for multiples of p, multiply mu[m] by -1. Then, for multiples of p^2, set mu[m] to 0.

So the sieve can be modified to compute the Möbius function.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, precompute μ for all numbers up to k.

Then, precompute pow_table for q up to k.

Once those are done, process each d, and for each q, compute the contribution to the delta array.

Now, the main challenge is to handle these steps efficiently, given that k can be up to 2e6.

But 2e6 is manageable in Python with efficient code.

Now, let's think about possible optimizations.

For the sieve, the standard sieve for Möbius function can be done in O(n log log n) time. For n=2e6, that's manageable.

For the pow_table, for each q from 0 to k, compute pow(q, n, MOD). But exponentiating q^n for q up to 2e6 could be done in O(k log n) time. But log n is 21 for n up to 2e6. So 2e6 * 20 = 4e7 operations, which might be acceptable. But in Python, pow(q, n, MOD) is optimized and uses an efficient algorithm, so this should be manageable.

But for q=0, 0^n is 0 except when n=0, which isn't possible here since n >=1. So pow_table[0] is 0. But in the problem statement, the array elements are between 1 and i, so q can't be zero here. Wait, when d is such that floor(i/d) = q, but for q=0, that would require i <d. But since d is up to i, q is at least 1. So in the code, for each d, q starts from 1. So the pow_table for q=0 is not needed. So maybe we can compute from q=1 to q=k.

But for q up to k, the code can compute pow(q, n, MOD).

Now, let's outline the code steps.

First, read n and k.

Then, compute the Möbius function up to k.

Then, compute pow_table for q from 1 to k.

Then, process each d, and for each q, compute the contribution.

Then, compute the prefix sum to get b_i for each i.

Then, compute the sum of (b_i XOR i) mod MOD.

Now, the Möbius function computation:

Implement sieve of Eratosthenes:

Initialize a list mu of size k+1.

mu[1] = 1.

Create a sieve array where for each prime p, we mark multiples. But to track the number of prime factors and squares.

Another approach:

Initialize a list of smallest prime factors (spf) for each number. Then, for each number, factorize it and compute the Möbius function.

But for numbers up to 2e6, this is feasible.

But factorization per number would take O(number of primes in factorization) time, which is manageable.

Alternatively, using a sieve that tracks the number of prime factors and whether any squared prime divides the number.

But let's proceed with the sieve approach.

Initialize an array 'is_square_free' and 'mu' array.

But the standard way to compute μ(d) is as follows:

- μ(d) is 0 if d has a squared prime factor.

- Else, μ(d) is (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors.

So, during sieve, for each number, track the number of distinct prime factors and whether any squared prime divides it.

An efficient way to compute this is to use a sieve that for each prime p, marks multiples of p^2 as non-square-free. Then, for numbers that are square-free, count the number of prime factors.

But perhaps a more efficient approach is to precompute the Möbius function via sieve of Eratosthenes.

Here's an algorithm for computing the Möbius function:

Initialize mu as [1] * (k+1).

For each prime p (found via sieve), for multiples of p:

- For each multiple m of p, divide m by p. If m is divisible by p again (i.e., m/p has p as a factor), then μ[m] = 0.

- Otherwise, multiply μ[m] by -1.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps. Let me think.

The sieve for Möbius function:

Initialize an array mu of size k+1, all elements initialized to 1.

Create an array of booleans is_prime of size k+1, initialized to True except 0 and 1.

For each p from 2 to k:

   if is_prime[p]:

      for m in range(p, k+1, p):

          is_prime[m] = False if m != p.

          exponent = 0

          tmp = m

          while tmp % p == 0:

              exponent +=1

              tmp //=p

          if exponent >=2:

              mu[m] = 0

          else:

              mu[m] *= (-1)

Wait, no. Because for each prime p, when processing m (multiple of p), we check how many times p divides m.

If it's more than once, then m is not square-free, so μ[m] becomes 0. Otherwise, multiply by -1.

But this approach would process each number multiple times, once for each prime factor. However, it's manageable for k up to 2e6.

But perhaps a better way is to process each prime p, and for each multiple of p, mark the contribution of p.

Alternatively, here's a correct approach:

Initialize mu as all 1.

Then, for each prime p (found via sieve of Eratosthenes), for each multiple m of p:

- Check if m is divisible by p^2. If yes, set mu[m] =0.

But this approach would need to process each p, then for each m in multiples of p, check if m is divisible by p^2. But for numbers that are already marked as 0 (non square-free), perhaps we can skip processing their factors.

Alternatively, here's the standard sieve-based method for Möbius function:

We can compute μ as follows:

Initialize mu[1] = 1.

For each i from 2 to k:

   if i is prime:

       for j in multiples of i up to k:

           if j / i is divisible by i (i.e., j is divisible by i^2):

               mu[j] =0

           else:

               mu[j] *= -1

But this isn't entirely accurate, because a number can have multiple prime factors, and the sieve needs to account for each prime factor.

An alternative approach is to track for each number its prime factors and exponents. For numbers that have any exponent >=2, μ is zero. Otherwise, μ is (-1) to the number of primes.

But factorizing each number may be time-consuming for 2e6 numbers. However, with a sieve, we can track the number of distinct prime factors and whether the number is square-free.

So here's a plan:

1. Initialize an array 'mu' with all 1s.

2. Create an array 'min_prime' where min_prime[i] is the smallest prime factor of i.

3. For each i from 2 to k:

   if i is prime (min_prime[i] is zero or i itself):

       min_prime[i] = i

       for j in multiples of i starting from i^2:

           if min_prime[j] is zero:

               min_prime[j] = i

       (This is the standard sieve to find primes and their smallest prime factors.)

Once min_prime is built, then for each number m, factorize it into primes, check if any prime appears more than once. If yes, μ[m] =0. Otherwise, count the number of primes and set μ[m] = (-1)^count.

But factorizing each m using min_prime is O(number of primes in factorization) per m, which is acceptable for 2e6 numbers.

So the steps for μ:

Initialize min_prime as an array of zeros.

for i from 2 to k:

   if min_prime[i] ==0:  # i is prime

       min_prime[i] = i

       for j from i*i to k step i:

           if min_prime[j] ==0:

               min_prime[j] =i

But this sieve gives the smallest prime factor for each composite number.

Then, for each m from 1 to k:

   if m ==1:

       mu[m] =1

   else:

       current = m

       res =1

       while current !=1:

           p = min_prime[current]

           cnt =0

           while current % p ==0:

               current = current //p

               cnt +=1

           if cnt >1:

               res =0

               break

           res *= -1

       mu[m] = res

This way, for each m, we factorize it into primes, count the exponents. If any exponent >=2, μ is 0. Else, μ is (-1)^number_of_primes.

Yes, this approach should work. For m up to 2e6, factorization is manageable.

Now, in Python, for 2e6 numbers, this loop may be time-consuming, but with proper optimization, it should work.

Once we have the mu array, the rest is manageable.

Next, compute the pow_table. For each q from 1 to k, compute pow(q, n, MOD). Since n can be up to 2e6, and q can be up to 2e6, we can compute pow(q, n, MOD) using the built-in pow function with three arguments, which is optimized in Python.

But since in Python, the pow function is O(log n), for each q, this is O(1) operation. So the pow_table can be computed as:

pow_table = [0] * (k +1)

for q in range(1, k+1):

    pow_table[q] = pow(q, n, MOD)

But for k=2e6, this loop would take O(2e6 * log n) steps, but log n is up to 21. However, since pow in Python is optimized, perhaps this is manageable.

Once pow_table is computed, the next step is to process each d and q, and update the delta array.

The delta array is a difference array where each interval [L, R] contributes a value v. So for each such interval, we do delta[L] +=v, delta[R+1] -=v. Then, after processing all intervals, we compute the prefix sum of delta to get the contribution for each i.

Now, in Python, handling this for 2e6 elements and 4e7 operations could be a problem, but let's think: For each d, we loop q up to k//d. For d=1, q goes up to k, which is 2e6. For d=2, q up to 1e6. So total q's are approximately sum_{d=1 to k} k//d = O(k log k). For k=2e6, this is about 2e6 * log(2e6) ~ 2e6 * 21 = 4.2e7 operations. Each iteration of q involves a few arithmetic operations and two updates to the delta array. But in Python, this may be tight for 3.5 seconds. So we need to optimize this part as much as possible.

To optimize, note that in Python, list accesses are faster than, say, dictionaries. So the delta array is a list of size k+2 (since R can be up to k). So for each d in 1..k, and for each q in 1..max_q:

Compute L = d * q

R = d * (q+1) -1

if R >k: R =k

contribution = mu[d] * pow_table[q]

mod this contribution.

Then, delta[L] += contribution

if R+1 <=k: delta[R+1] -= contribution

But each of these operations is O(1). So 4e7 operations in Python could be manageable. But we need to precompute mu and pow_table correctly.

Once the delta array is built, we compute the prefix sum to get the b array. Then, for each i from 1 to k, compute (b_i XOR i), accumulate the sum.

But what about the initial value of delta? The delta array is initialized to 0. Then, after all updates, we compute the prefix sum as follows:

current =0

for i in 1..k:

    current += delta[i]

    current %= MOD

    b_i = current

    sum += (b_i ^i) mod MOD

But wait, the delta array is a difference array. The actual value of b_i is the sum of all contributions from d and q where i is in [d*q, ...]. So the prefix sum approach works here.

Wait, no. The delta array is a difference array where each delta[L] += contribution, delta[R+1] -= contribution. Then, the prefix sum of delta gives for each i the sum of all contributions from intervals that include i. So yes, the code for the prefix sum is correct.

Now, let's test the example.

Sample Input 1: 3 4

n=3, k=4.

Compute μ(d) for d=1 to 4:

d=1: factors none. μ(1) =1.

d=2: prime, one factor. μ(2) =-1.

d=3: prime. μ(3)=-1.

d=4: factors 2^2. So μ(4)=0.

pow_table for q=1: 1^3=1 mod MOD.

q=2: 8 mod MOD.

q=3: 27.

q=4: 64.

Processing each d:

d=1, mu=1.

max_q=4//1=4.

q from 1 to 4:

q=1:

contribution=1 *1=1.

L=1*1=1, R=1*2-1=1. Since R=1 <=4.

delta[1] +=1 → delta[1] =1.

delta[2] -=1.

q=2:

contribution=1 *8=8.

L=2, R=3-1=3.

So delta[2] +=8 → 8, delta[4] -=8.

q=3:

contribution=1*27=27.

L=3, R=4-1=3 (since d=1, q=3: 1*3=3, 1*(3+1)-1=3+3=4-1=3? Wait, d=1, q=3: L=1*3=3, R=1*(3+1) -1=4-1=3. So R=3. So delta[3] +=27, delta[4] -=27.

q=4: contribution=1*64=64. L=4, R=5-1=4 (since d=1*4=4). So delta[4] +=64, delta[5] -=64. But 5 is beyond k=4. So delta[4] +=64.

Now, the delta array after d=1:

Indices 1: +1

2: +8-1=7?

Wait, initial delta is all zero. After processing d=1:

For q=1:

delta[1] +=1 → delta[1] =1.

delta[2] -=1.

For q=2:

delta[2] +=8 → delta[2] =8-1=7? No. Because the delta array is initially 0. So after processing q=1, delta[1] is 1, delta[2] is -1. Then for q=2, delta[2] +=8 → delta[2] = (-1 +8) =7? No, because in the code, each step is adding to the delta array. So the code for q=2:

delta[2] +=8 → delta[2] =8 (since initial was 0, but for q=1, delta[2] was set to -1. Then for q=2, delta[2] is +=8 → delta[2] becomes 7 (because initial delta[2] was -1, then add 8, which is 7).

Wait, perhaps the code processes each d and q in order, and the delta array is modified cumulatively. So for d=1, q=1: delta[1] +=1, delta[2] -=1.

Then, q=2: delta[2] +=8, delta[4] -=8.

q=3: delta[3] +=27, delta[4] -=27.

q=4: delta[4] +=64, delta[5] -=64.

So after processing d=1, the delta array is:

delta[1] =1

delta[2] =8-1=7?

Wait, no. The delta array is initialized to zero. For d=1, q=1:

delta[1] +=1 → delta[1] is 1.

delta[2] -=1 → delta[2] is -1.

Then, q=2:

delta[2] +=8 → delta[2] becomes -1 +8 =7.

delta[4] -=8 → delta[4] becomes -8.

q=3:

delta[3] +=27 → delta[3] =27.

delta[4] -=27 → delta[4] is -8-27 =-35.

q=4:

delta[4] +=64 → delta[4] is -35 +64=29.

delta[5] -=64 → but 5>4, so we don't process that.

So after d=1, delta[1] is 1, delta[2] is 7, delta[3] is 27, delta[4] is 29.

Then, processing d=2 (mu is -1):

max_q=4//2=2.

q=1:

contribution= -1 * pow(1,3) =-1.

L=2*1=2, R=2*(1+1)-1=3-1=3-1=3? Wait, d=2, q=1: L=2*1=2. R=2*(1+1) -1=4-1=3. So the interval is [2,3].

So add -1 to delta[2], subtract -1 from delta[4].

So delta[2] +=-1 → 7-1=6.

delta[4] -= -1 → 29 +1=30.

q=2:

contribution= -1 * 8 =-8.

L=2*2=4. R=2*(2+1)-1=5-1=4 (since 5-1=4, but i can't exceed 4). So R=4.

Add -8 to delta[4], subtract from delta[5], which is beyond k.

So delta[4] +=-8 →30-8=22.

So after d=2:

delta[2] is 6, delta[3] is 27, delta[4] is 22.

Processing d=3 (mu=-1):

max_q=4//3=1.

q=1:

contribution= -1 *1 =-1.

L=3*1=3, R=3*(1+1)-1=6-1=5 → but k=4, so R=4.

Add -1 to delta[3], subtract -1 from delta[4+1=5], which is beyond k.

So delta[3] +=-1 →27-1=26.

delta[4] remains 22.

d=4: mu is 0, so skip.

So after all d's:

delta[1]=1, delta[2]=6, delta[3]=26, delta[4]=22.

Now compute the prefix sum:

current starts at 0.

i=1:

current += delta[1] →0+1=1. b_1=1.

sum += 1 XOR 1 = 0.

i=2:

current += delta[2] →1 +6=7. b_2=7.

sum +=7 XOR 2 =5. sum is 5.

i=3:

current += delta[3] →7 +26=33. mod 1e9+7 is 33. b_3=33.

sum +=33 XOR3= 33^3= 34. sum 5+34=39.

i=4:

current += delta[4] →33 +22=55. b_4=55.

sum +=55^4= 55 XOR4= 55 is 0x37, 4 is 0x100, so binary 55 is 110111, 4 is 100. XOR is 110111 XOR 000100 = 110011 = 51. So sum is 39+51=90.

But according to the sample input, the output is 82. Wait, this suggests a mistake.

Hmm. Wait the sample input's first case is 3 4. The output is 82.

But according to the calculation here, the sum is 0+5+34+51=90. But the sample says the sum is 82. So there's an error in this approach.

Wait, the sample says that for i=3, b_3 is 25. But according to our calculation, b_3=33. So something is wrong here.

Ah! Clearly, there's a mistake in the approach. So where did we go wrong?

Let's re-examine the problem.

The formula for b_i is sum_{d=1 to i} μ(d) * (floor(i/d))^n.

In the sample input, for i=3, the correct b_3 is 25.

But according to our approach, after processing all d and q, the sum for i=3 would be:

sum over d=1, 2, 3 of μ(d) * (floor(3/d))^3.

Let's compute this manually.

d=1: μ(1)=1. floor(3/1)=3. 3^3=27. contribution 1*27=27.

d=2: μ(2)=-1. floor(3/2)=1. 1^3=1. contribution -1*1 =-1.

d=3: μ(3)=-1. floor(3/3)=1. contribution -1*1=-1.

Sum is 27-1-1=25. Which matches the sample's b_3=25.

But according to our approach, the delta array for i=3 was 26, leading to a current of 33. So there's a mistake in the code's approach.

Wait, how did that happen?

In the code's delta array approach, the sum for i=3 would be contributions from intervals that include 3.

Let's retrace the steps.

Processing d=1:

For q=3, the interval is [3,3]. So delta[3] +=27. So contribution is 27 for i=3.

Processing d=2, q=1: interval [2,3]. contribution is -1. So delta[2] +=-1 and delta[4] +=1. But in the code's delta array:

For d=2, q=1, contribution is -1. So delta[2] +=-1 (from previous step), which would be added to delta[2] during processing. Then, when the prefix sum is computed, delta[2] is 6 (as per previous steps) but how?

Wait, perhaps the code's way of handling the delta array is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach of using the difference array is not correctly capturing the sum for each i.

Wait, the delta array is built as follows:

Each interval [L, R] contributes a certain value. For each such interval, add the value to delta[L], subtract from delta[R+1].

Then, when you compute the prefix sum of delta, you get for each i the sum of all contributions that include i in their interval.

So in the example, for i=3:

Which intervals include 3?

From d=1, q=3: [3,3], contributes 27.

From d=1, q=2: [2,3], contributes 8.

From d=2, q=1: [2,3], contributes -1.

From d=3, q=1: [3,4], contributes -1.

So sum for i=3 is 27+8-1 + (-1) ?

Wait, no. Let's list all d and q pairs where 3 is in [d*q, R]:

For d=1:

q=1: [1,1] → i=3 not in this interval.

q=2: [2,3] → i=3 is included. contribution is 8.

q=3: [3,3] → included. contribution 27.

d=2:

q=1: [2,3] → included. contribution -1.

d=3:

q=1: [3,4] → i=3 is included. contribution -1.

So sum for i=3 is 8 (d=1 q=2) +27 (d=1 q=3) + (-1) (d=2 q=1) + (-1) (d=3 q=1) → 8+27-1-1=33.

But the correct sum is 27 (d=1) + (-1) (d=2) + (-1) (d=3) =25.

So where is the discrepancy?

Ah! The code's approach is adding contributions from d=1 q=2 (q=2, which is floor(3/1)=3? No. Wait, for d=1, q=2:

d=1, q=2: L=1*2=2, R=1*3-1=2. So the interval is [2,2]. So i=3 is not in this interval. Wait, this is a critical mistake in the code's calculation.

Oh no! I think I have a mistake in how the intervals are computed.

Wait, the code computes for each q and d:

L =d*q

R =d*(q+1)-1.

But for example, when d=1 and q=2:

L=1*2=2

R=1*(2+1)-1=3-1=2.

So the interval is [2,2]. For i=3, this is not included. So the code's approach for d=1, q=2 is contributing to i=2, not i=3. So why did the code's delta array have delta[2] +=8 and delta[4] -=8 for q=2 of d=1?

Ah, that's the mistake. For d=1 and q=2, the interval is [2,2], which is i=2. So the contribution of 8 is added to i=2.

Then, for d=1, q=3: L=3, R=3. i=3.

So when processing d=1:

q=1: interval [1,1] → i=1.

q=2: interval [2,2] → i=2.

q=3: interval [3,3] → i=3.

q=4: interval [4,4] → i=4.

So for i=3, the contribution from d=1 is q=3: 27.

For d=2, q=1: L=2*1=2, R=2*(1+1)-1=3. So interval [2,3]. So i=3 is included. contribution is -1.

For d=3, q=1: L=3*1=3, R=3*(1+1)-1=5-1=4. So interval [3,4]. So i=3 is included. contribution is -1.

So sum for i=3 is 27 (from d=1 q=3) + (-1) (d=2 q=1) + (-1) (d=3 q=1) → 25, which matches the sample.

But according to the code's approach, when processing d=1 q=2, the contribution is added to i=2. So in the code's delta array for i=3, the contributions are from d=1 q=3, d=2 q=1, d=3 q=1.

So the code's delta array for i=3 is:

delta[3] +=27 (from d=1 q=3)

delta[4] -=27.

Then, for d=2 q=1: delta[2] +=-1, delta[4] +=1.

For d=3 q=1: delta[3] +=-1, delta[4+1=5] -= -1 (but 5>k=4, so not processed).

So the delta array after processing all d's is:

delta[1] =1 (from d=1 q=1)

delta[2] =-1 (from d=1 q=1) +8 (from d=1 q=2) + (-1) (from d=2 q=1) →-1 +8-1=6.

delta[3] =27 (from d=1 q=3) + (-1) (from d=3 q=1) →27-1=26.

delta[4] = -8 (from d=1 q=2) -27 (from d=1 q=3) +1 (from d=2 q=1) + (-8) (from d=2 q=2) → ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to re-calculate the delta array step by step.

Let's re-calculate the delta array for the sample.

After processing d=1:

For d=1 q=1:

L=1, R=1 → delta[1] +=1, delta[2] -=1.

For q=2:

L=2, R=2 → delta[2] +=8, delta[3] -=8.

For q=3:

L=3, R=3 → delta[3] +=27, delta[4] -=27.

For q=4:

L=4, R=4 → delta[4] +=64, delta[5] -=64.

So after d=1:

delta[1] =1

delta[2] =-1 (from q=1) +8 (from q=2) →7.

delta[3] =-8 (from q=2) +27 (from q=3) →19.

delta[4] =-27 (from q=3) +64 (from q=4) →37.

delta[5] =-64.

Processing d=2 (mu=-1):

q=1:

L=2*1=2, R=2*(1+1)-1=3. So interval [2,3].

contribution: -1 *1 =-1.

So delta[2] +=-1 →7-1=6.

delta[4] -= -1 →37+1=38.

q=2:

L=2*2=4, R=2*(2+1)-1=5-1=4.

contribution: -1*8 =-8.

delta[4] +=-8 →38-8=30.

delta[5] -= -8 →-64+8= -56.

Processing d=3 (mu=-1):

q=1:

L=3*1=3, R=3*(1+1)-1=5-1=4.

contribution: -1*1 =-1.

delta[3] +=-1 →19-1=18.

delta[4+1=5] -= -1 →-56 +1= -55.

d=4 is skipped.

Now delta array after all processing:

delta[1] =1

delta[2] =6

delta[3] =18

delta[4] =30

delta[5] =-55.

Now compute prefix sum:

current=0

i=1:

current +=1 →1. b_1=1. sum +=1^1=0.

i=2:

current +=6 →7. b_2=7. sum +=7^2=5.

i=3:

current +=18 →7+18=25. b_3=25. sum +=25^3=26 → sum 0+5+26=31.

i=4:

current +=30 →25+30=55. b_4=55. sum +=55^4=51 →31+51=82.

Which matches the sample's output of 82.

Ah! So the previous mistake was in how the code was handling the delta array. The correct approach is:

For each d and q, the interval [L, R] is determined correctly, and the delta array is updated for L and R+1. Then, when the prefix sum is computed, the contributions are correctly added.

In the previous example, the code's approach was correct. So the error in the initial manual calculation was due to incorrect interval assumptions.

So the code approach is correct. The mistake in the previous manual calculation was due to incorrect handling of the intervals.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, the code needs to be implemented in Python with the following steps:

1. Compute Möbius function for all d up to k.

2. Precompute pow_table for q from 1 to k.

3. Initialize delta array.

4. For each d, loop through q and update delta.

5. Compute prefix sum to get b_i for each i.

6. Compute the sum of (b_i XOR i) mod MOD.

Now, considering the constraints, the code must be optimized.

Possible optimizations in Python:

- Precompute the Möbius function using sieve.

- Precompute pow_table using list comprehensions.

- Use a list for delta, and avoid using dictionaries.

- Use efficient loops, avoiding unnecessary operations.

But in Python, for loops can be slow for large ranges. So using sieve efficiently is crucial.

Let's proceed with writing the code.

First, read n and k.

Then, compute Möbius function.

Implement the sieve of smallest primes and compute mu.

Then, compute pow_table.

Then, process each d and q.

Then, compute prefix sum.

Then, compute the XOR sum.

Now, let's write the code.

But in Python, for k up to 2e6, the code must be optimized. For example, using list comprehensions for initializing arrays.

Let's proceed.

Sample code:

MOD = 10**9+7

n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Compute Möbius function
max_mu = k
mu = [1]*(max_mu +1)
min_prime = [0]*(max_mu +1)

for i in range(2, max_mu+1):
    if min_prime[i] ==0:
        min_prime[i] =i
        for j in range(i*i, max_mu+1, i):
            if min_prime[j] ==0:
                min_prime[j] =i
# Now compute mu
for i in range(2, max_mu+1):
    if i ==1:
        continue
    current =i
    res =1
    is_square_free = True
    while current !=1:
        p = min_prime[current]
        cnt =0
        while current % p ==0:
            current = current //p
            cnt +=1
        if cnt >1:
            is_square_free = False
            break
        res *= -1
    if not is_square_free:
        mu[i] =0
    else:
        mu[i] =res

# Precompute pow_table
pow_table = [0]*(k+2)
for q in range(1, k+1):
    pow_table[q] = pow(q, n, MOD)

# Initialize delta array
delta = [0]*(k+2)

for d in range(1, k+1):
    if mu[d] ==0:
        continue
    current_mu = mu[d]
    max_q = k //d
    for q in range(1, max_q+1):
        contribution = (current_mu * pow_table[q]) % MOD
        L = d * q
        if L >k:
            continue
        R = d * (q+1) -1
        if R >k:
            R =k
        delta[L] = (delta[L] + contribution) % MOD
        if R+1 <=k:
            delta[R+1] = (delta[R+1] - contribution) % MOD

# Compute prefix sum
current =0
result =0
for i in range(1, k+1):
    current = (current + delta[i]) % MOD
    res = current % MOD
    xor_val = res ^i
    result = (result + xor_val) % MOD

print(result % MOD)

Now, this code should work for the sample input.

Testing the first sample:

When d=1, q=1: contribution 1*1=1. L=1, R=1. delta[1] +=1.

q=2: contribution 1*8=8. L=2, R=2. delta[2] +=8.

q=3: contribution 1*27=27. L=3, R=3. delta[3] +=27.

q=4: contribution 1*64=64. L=4, R=4. delta[4] +=64.

d=2: mu=-1.

q=1: contribution -1*1= -1. L=2, R=3-1=3. So delta[2] +=-1, delta[4] +=1.

q=2: contribution -1*8=-8. L=4, R=5-1=4. delta[4] +=-8.

d=3: mu=-1.

q=1: contribution -1*1=-1. L=3, R=4. delta[3] +=-1. delta[5] +=1.

d=4: mu=0. skipped.

Processing delta:

After all d and q:

delta[1] =1

delta[2] =8-1=7 (from d=1 q=2 and d=2 q=1)

delta[3] =27-1=26 (from d=1 q=3 and d=3 q=1)

delta[4] =64-8+1=57 (from d=1 q=4, d=2 q=1, d=2 q=2).

But according to the code, delta[4] =64 (from d=1 q=4) + (-8) (from d=2 q=2) +1 (from d=2 q=1) → 64-8+1=57.

Then, when computing prefix sum:

current starts at 0.

i=1: current +=1 →1. res=1. XOR 1 →0. sum is 0.

i=2: current +=7 →8. res=8. XOR 2 → 10 (8 is 1000, 2 is 0010; XOR is 1010 (10)). sum is 0+10=10.

Wait, but sample output is 82.

Hmm, something is wrong here.

Wait, in the sample input, after processing all d's, the delta array for i=3 is 26 (27-1). So when prefix sum is computed, for i=3:

current is 8 (from i=2) + delta[3] (26) → 8+26=34 mod MOD. So res=34. Then, XOR with 3 is 34 XOR3 = 33. sum becomes 0+5 (from i=2) +33 =38.

Wait, but this contradicts the sample's correct answer.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the code. Let's re-calculate the code's delta array and prefix sum.

Let me re-calculate the code's steps for the sample input.

Sample input: n=3, k=4.

mu array after sieve:

mu[1] =1.

mu[2] =-1.

mu[3] =-1.

mu[4] =0.

pow_table:

pow_table[1] =1^3=1.

pow_table[2]=8.

pow_table[3]=27.

pow_table[4]=64.

delta initialized to [0]*(4+2) → size 6. Initially all zeros.

Processing d=1:

mu[d]=1.

max_q =4//1=4.

q=1:

contribution =1 *1=1.

L=1*1=1.

R=1*(1+1)-1=1+1-1=1.

So R=1.

delta[1] +=1 → delta[1] =1.

delta[2] -=1 → delta[2] =-1.

q=2:

contribution =1*8=8.

L=2*1=2.

R=2*(2+1)-1=3-1=2.

delta[2] +=8 → delta[2] =-1+8=7.

delta[3] -=8 → delta[3] =-8.

q=3:

contribution=1*27=27.

L=3*1=3.

R=3*(3+1)-1=4*1-1=3.

delta[3] +=27 →-8+27=19.

delta[4] -=27 → delta[4] =-27.

q=4:

contribution=1*64=64.

L=4*1=4.

R=4*(4+1)-1=5*4-1=19-1=19-1=4*5-1=20-1=19? Wait, no. For d=1, q=4:

L=1*4=4.

R=1*(4+1)-1=5-1=4.

So R=4.

delta[4] +=64 →-27+64=37.

delta[5] -=64 → delta[5] =-64.

Processing d=2:

mu[d]=-1.

max_q=4//2=2.

q=1:

contribution =-1 *1 =-1.

L=2*1=2.

R=2*(1+1)-1=4-1=3.

delta[2] +=-1 →7-1=6.

delta[4] -= -1 →37+1=38.

q=2:

contribution =-1*8=-8.

L=2*2=4.

R=2*(2+1)-1=6-1=5 → but k=4. So R=4.

delta[4] +=-8 →38-8=30.

delta[5] -= -8 →-64+8=-56.

Processing d=3:

mu[d]=-1.

max_q=4//3=1.

q=1:

contribution =-1*1 =-1.

L=3*1=3.

R=3*(1+1)-1=6-1=5 → but k=4. So R=4.

delta[3] +=-1 →19-1=18.

delta[5] -= -1 →-56+1=-55.

d=4 is skipped.

Now, delta array is:

index 0:0

1:1

2:6

3:18

4:30

5: -55

6:0

Now compute prefix sum:

current=0.

i=1: current +=1 →1. res=1. sum +=1^1=0.

i=2: current +=6 →7. res=7. sum +=7^2=5. sum=5.

i=3: current +=18 →25. res=25. sum +=25^3=26. sum=5+26=31.

i=4: current +=30 →55. res=55. sum +=55^4=51. sum=31+51=82.

Which matches the sample.

So the code works correctly.

Now, testing for the second sample input (2000000 8), which has a large n but small k.

But the code is correct for that case.

Now, the code must be efficient. For k=2e6, the sieve of min_prime is O(k log log k), which is manageable.

The pow_table is computed in O(k) steps, each with pow(q, n, MOD), which is fast in Python.

The processing of d and q loops is O(k log k) steps.

In Python, for k=2e6, this may be tight for the time limit. However, the code must be optimized.

But in the code, the loops are nested: for each d in 1..k, and for each q in 1..max_q.

But for d=1, max_q=k=2e6, which would take 2e6 iterations. However, this may be slow in Python. So to optimize, perhaps precompute the max_q for each d and handle the loops in a way that reduces the number of iterations.

But in Python, even 4e7 operations can take a few seconds. However, the time limit is 3.5 seconds. So this code should pass.

Another optimization: precompute pow_table and cache it.

But as written, the code is correct and should work.

Now, the code should be written as follows.
