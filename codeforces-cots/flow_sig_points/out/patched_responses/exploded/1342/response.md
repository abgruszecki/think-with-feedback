Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of possible previous states that could result in the given current state after one second. Let me think through the problem step by step.

First, understanding the transformation process. Each second, all pairs of cowboys that are aiming at each other (like A followed by B or B followed by A?) Wait, no. Wait, the problem says a pair of neighboring cowboys aim at each other. So for a pair to turn around, they must be adjacent and pointing towards each other. For example, if two adjacent cowboys are in positions i and i+1 (mod n, since it's a circle), then if the first is 'A' (points clockwise, which would be towards i+1) and the next is 'B' (points counter-clockwise, which is towards i), then they are pointing at each other. So in that case, both would flip. Similarly, a 'B' followed by an 'A' would also point at each other? Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify.

Each cowboy can be either A or B. A means they are pointing to the next in clockwise direction (so, their right neighbor in the circle), and B means pointing to the previous (left neighbor in the circle). So two adjacent cowboys form a pair that flips if they are pointing at each other. So for a pair at positions i and i+1 (mod n), if the i-th is A (points to i+1) and the i+1-th is B (points to i), then they are pointing at each other and will flip. Similarly, if i is B and i+1 is A, then they are pointing away from each other. Wait, no. Wait, B points counter-clockwise. So if a cowboy is B, they are pointing to their left neighbor (i-1 mod n). So, in a pair (i, i+1), if the i-th is B (points to i-1) and the i+1-th is A (points to i+1 +1?), wait no. Wait, the circle is made of the string s, where each character represents a cowboy. The record is made from the first of them in clockwise direction. So the order is clockwise. So, for a cowboy at position i, the next in clockwise is i+1 mod n. So, for a cowboy i, if they are 'A', they are pointing to i+1. If 'B', pointing to i-1. So in the pair (i, i+1), if the i is 'A' (pointing to i+1) and the i+1 is 'B' (pointing to i), then they are pointing at each other and will flip. So this pair forms an "AB" or "BA"? Wait, in the pair (i, i+1), the i is 'A' (points to i+1) and i+1 is 'B' (points to i). So that's an 'A' followed by a 'B' in the string. That's the case where the pair flips. So any occurrence of "AB" or "BA" in the string (considering the circular arrangement) would be flipped pairs. Wait, but in a circular string, the last character is adjacent to the first. So the entire circle is considered as a ring.

Now, the transformation happens as follows: all such pairs (adjacent and pointing at each other) are flipped simultaneously. Each cowboy in such a pair flips their direction. So, for example, in the pair "AB", both A and B would become B and A, respectively? Or wait, flipping here means they turn around. So if a cowboy is part of a flipping pair, their direction is reversed. So A becomes B and B becomes A.

Wait, the problem statement says: if a pair of cowboys realize that they aim at each other, they turn around. So, in such a pair, each cowboy reverses direction. So in the example where the pair is AB, after flipping, they become BA. But that's the same as the original pair. Wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. Suppose the pair is AB. The first is A (points to next), the next is B (points to previous). So they are pointing at each other. So both flip. So A becomes B, B becomes A. So the pair becomes BA. But that's the same as before. Wait, that's confusing. For example, in the pair AB, after flipping, both reverse, so they become BA. Now, the pair BA is the same as before, so they would flip again? But that can't be right. So what's the process here?

Wait, the transformation happens once per second. All pairs that are in a conflicting state (pointing at each other) are processed simultaneously. Each cowboy in such a pair reverses their direction.

So for a pair AB, after flipping, both become B and A. So the pair becomes BA. But then, that BA would again form a conflicting pair. But during the same second, all pairs are processed once. So during the transformation step, all pairs are checked first, and then all the flips are done at the same time.

So the steps are:

1. For the current state, find all pairs of adjacent cowboys that are pointing at each other. For each such pair, mark them for flipping.

2. For all marked pairs, each cowboy in the pair flips their direction (A becomes B, B becomes A). All these flips happen at the same time.

So the next state is determined by applying all flips simultaneously.

Now, the problem is, given the current state s (after one second), find the number of possible previous states that could have transformed into s after exactly one second.

So to find all possible previous states P such that when you apply the transformation (find all conflicting pairs, flip their directions) on P, you get s. We need to count all such possible P.

So the approach is to reverse-engineer the transformation. Given the current state s, find all possible previous states P where applying the transformation to P gives s.

Each such P must differ from s by exactly the flips that occurred during the transformation. So when we apply the transformation to P, the result is s.

To model this, we need to find all possible sets of pairs in P that could have been flipped to produce s.

But the problem is that when you reverse the transformation, you have to figure out which pairs in s could have been flipped pairs in the previous state. Because when you apply the transformation to P, each such pair is flipped, leading to s. So to get from P to s, every conflicting pair in P must be flipped. So the process is:

For each possible previous state P, the next state s is obtained by flipping all conflicting pairs in P.

Therefore, s is obtained by taking P, flipping each pair of conflicting pairs in P. So the problem is to find all possible P such that flipping all conflicting pairs in P gives s.

But how to reverse this process? Let's think: For the current state s, what possible previous states P could have existed such that when you flip all conflicting pairs in P, you get s.

So the question is: what P can be transformed into s by flipping all the conflicting pairs in P.

Let me think of it as s = transform(P). So we need to find all P such that transform(P) = s.

So to model this, for each possible P, we can compute transform(P) and check if it equals s. But given that the length can be up to 100, this approach (brute-forcing all possible P) is not feasible.

Therefore, we need a smarter approach to model the transformation and find the possible P's.

Let's model the transformation. Let's denote that during the transformation, each conflicting pair (AB or BA) in P is flipped. So, for each such pair in P, the two cowboys in the pair flip their direction. However, since the pairs are processed simultaneously, the order doesn't matter, and overlapping pairs (like two consecutive pairs) would affect each other.

Wait, for example, consider a P of "ABBA". The conflicting pairs are the first two (AB) and the last two (BA). So during the transformation, both pairs are flipped. The first pair becomes BA (so after flipping, the first two are BB?), wait no. Let's see:

Original P: A B B A → indices 0, 1, 2, 3.

Conflicting pairs are (0,1) (A and B) and (2,3) (B and A). Each of these pairs is flipped.

Each cowboy in the conflicting pair flips their direction. So for (0,1), each of the two cowboys flips. So 0 changes from A to B, and 1 changes from B to A. So after this, the pair becomes BA. Similarly, the (2,3) pair: 2 is B → A, 3 is A → B. So after flipping, the pair becomes AB.

So the transformed state would be:

Original P: A B B A → after flipping pairs (0,1) and (2,3), the new state is B A A B.

Wait, but the entire state is a circle. So the process is that all conflicting pairs are found in P, then all of their cowboys are flipped. So each cowboy that is part of any conflicting pair in P will flip. Since a cowboy can be part of two pairs (like in a trio like ABA, the middle B is part of the pair with A and the pair with the next A), but in such a case, if the B and the next A form a conflicting pair (BA?), then the B is part of two pairs. So, for example, in the case of P = ABA, the pairs are (0,1) (A and B) and (1,2) (B and A). Both are conflicting pairs. So during the transformation, all cowboys in these pairs are flipped. So cowboy 0 flips (A→B), cowboy 1 flips (B→A) twice (since it's in two pairs), and cowboy 2 flips (A→B). Wait, but when you flip a cowboy twice, you end up with the original. So in this case, each cowboy in a pair is flipped once for each pair they are part of. So if a cowboy is part of two conflicting pairs, they will be flipped twice, which would cancel out.

Wait, this is a critical point. Let's take an example:

P is "ABA". Let's list all conflicting pairs. The first two (A and B) form a conflicting pair. The next two (B and A) form another conflicting pair. So during transformation, each cowboy in these pairs flips. So for the first pair, 0 and 1 flip. For the second pair, 1 and 2 flip. So cowboy 1 is part of both pairs. So their direction is flipped twice.

So in this case, the original P is A B A.

After flipping:

Cowboy 0 flips (A → B).

Cowboy 1 flips (B → A) twice → B → A → B again.

Cowboy 2 flips (A → B).

So the transformed state is B B B.

Wait, so the conflicting pairs in P cause each cowboy in those pairs to flip once per pair. But overlapping pairs (like in ABA) can cause a cowboy to be flipped twice, which would negate the flip (since flipping twice returns to original state).

So the transformation for a cowboy is determined by the number of conflicting pairs they are part of in P. If even, no change. If odd, they flip once.

So when modeling the transformation, each cowboy's new state depends on the number of conflicting pairs they were part of in P. Each such pair in P causes a flip. So the total number of flips for a cowboy is equal to the number of conflicting pairs in P that include that cowboy. Each flip changes the character (A ↔ B). So if the count is even, the character remains the same; if odd, it flips.

But how does this affect the resulting state s?

The problem is to find all P such that when we apply this transformation (flip each cowboy once for each conflicting pair they are part of in P) then the result is s.

But how can we model this?

Let's model each character in s as s_i. Each character in P is p_i. Then, for each i, s_i is equal to p_i flipped (A ↔ B) if the number of conflicting pairs in P that involve i is odd; otherwise, it's the same as p_i.

So, the key is to find p such that for each i, s_i = p_i if the number of conflicting pairs in p involving i is even, or s_i = flip(p_i) if it's odd.

But how to model the conflicting pairs in p. Conflicting pairs in p are pairs (i, i+1) where p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B (i.e., p_i and p_{i+1} form "AB") or p_i is B and p_{i+1} is A ("BA")?

Wait, no. The conflicting pairs in p are those where the two cowboys point at each other. So for a pair (i, i+1) in p, the pair is conflicting if p_i is A (points to i+1) and p_{i+1} is B (points to i). So "AB" is a conflicting pair. Similarly, "BA" would not be a conflicting pair. Wait, let's clarify:

A pair (i, i+1) in p is a conflicting pair if and only if p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B. Because:

- i is A → pointing to i+1.

- i+1 is B → pointing to i.

So they are pointing at each other. Hence, a conflicting pair.

If the pair is BA: i is B → pointing to i-1 (which is i's previous in the circle). i+1 is A → pointing to i+2. So in this case, they are not pointing at each other. So BA is not a conflicting pair.

Wait, so conflicting pairs in p are only the "AB" pairs. So, in the previous example of P being "ABBA", the conflicting pairs are (0,1) (AB) and (3,0) (since it's a circle). Wait, no. Wait, the entire string is a circle, so the pairs are (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,0). So in "ABBA", the pairs are:

0 and 1: A and B → conflicting.

1 and 2: B and B → not conflicting.

2 and 3: B and A → not conflicting (since B points to 1, A points to 3+1=4 mod 4 → 0).

3 and 0: A and A → not conflicting.

So only pair (0,1) is conflicting. So when we flip, 0 and 1 are flipped. So 0 becomes B, 1 becomes A. The new string is B A B A. So the resulting state after transformation is "BABA".

So the key is that the conflicting pairs in P are those adjacent pairs (i, i+1) where p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B. So each such pair in P will cause both i and i+1 to flip once.

Thus, for each such conflicting pair in P, the cowboys at positions i and i+1 will be flipped once. So the number of flips for a cowboy at position i is equal to the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i. For example, if i is part of two conflicting pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1), then i is flipped twice (so no change).

So, given s, we need to find all possible P where for each position i in P:

s_i = p_i XOR (number of conflicting pairs in P that include i is odd) → XOR here represents whether the character is flipped.

But how can we model this? Let's think in terms of variables.

Let's denote for each position i, the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i as c_i. Then, for each i, s_i is equal to p_i if c_i is even, or the flipped version if c_i is odd.

So, the problem reduces to finding all possible P and their corresponding c_i (which are determined by the conflicting pairs in P) such that s_i = flip^{c_i}(p_i) for all i.

But c_i is determined by the number of conflicting pairs in P that involve i. A conflicting pair in P is (j, j+1) where p_j = A and p_{j+1} = B. So for each such pair, j and j+1 are counted in c_j and c_{j+1}.

So, c_i is the number of neighboring pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) in P where the pair is conflicting (A followed by B).

But this seems circular because P itself determines the conflicting pairs, which in turn determine c_i, which affect how s is formed.

We need to find P such that when we compute all conflicting pairs in P, then apply the flips (c_i times), we get s.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:

We can model the transformation from P to s as:

s_i = p_i if the number of conflicting pairs (in P) involving i is even, else flip(p_i).

But how can we model this?

Let's consider that for each position i in s, the value of s_i depends on p_i and the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i. Let's denote x_i as the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i. So, x_i is 0, 1, or 2 (since each position can be in at most two pairs: the pair (i-1, i) and (i, i+1)).

So, x_i is the sum of two binary variables: whether (i-1, i) is a conflicting pair (A followed by B), and whether (i, i+1) is a conflicting pair (A followed by B).

But (i-1, i) is a conflicting pair if and only if p_{i-1} is A and p_i is B.

Similarly, (i, i+1) is a conflicting pair if p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B.

So, x_i = [p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B'] (count 1 if true) + [p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B'] (count 1 if true).

Then, s_i is equal to p_i if x_i is even, otherwise it's flip(p_i).

So for each i:

s_i = flip(p_i) if x_i is odd, else p_i.

This gives us a system of equations that must hold for all positions i.

Our goal is to find all possible P (strings of A and B) of the same length as s, such that for all i:

s_i = p_i ^ (x_i mod 2), where ^ represents XOR (flipping when x_i is odd).

But solving this system for P is challenging, especially given the circular dependencies (since the string is circular).

Let's try to model this. For each i, we can express x_i as:

x_i = (p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B') + (p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B').

Then, the equation becomes:

s_i = p_i if (x_i % 2 == 0) else (flip(p_i)).

But how can we model this as equations for p_i?

Perhaps we can express this in terms of p_i and the neighboring p's.

Alternatively, since each x_i is a function of p's, perhaps we can model the problem as a system of equations that must be satisfied for each i.

But given that the equations are interdependent (p_i affects x_i and x_{i-1}, etc.), this seems complex.

An alternative approach is to note that the transformation is invertible only up to certain possibilities, and for the given s, the possible P's can be determined by considering the possible ways the flips could have occurred.

But given that the transformation is not one-to-one, the number of possible P's can vary.

Another idea: Since the transformation is applied once to get from P to s, perhaps the possible previous states P can be determined by considering which pairs in s would have been flipped in the transformation. But since the transformation is determined by the previous state's pairs, this is not straightforward.

Wait, but the transformation from P to s involves flipping all conflicting pairs in P. So, to find P such that flipping all those pairs gives s, perhaps the process can be modeled as s being the result of flipping certain pairs in P. But which pairs?

But in this case, the pairs that are flipped in P are exactly the conflicting pairs in P (the AB pairs). So, for each conflicting pair in P, the two elements are flipped once each.

So, for example, if in P there's a conflicting pair at positions (i, i+1), then in the transformation, both p_i and p_{i+1} are flipped. So, the resulting s's elements are determined by the original p's and the number of times they were flipped (once for each conflicting pair they are part of).

So the key is to model the flips as a bitmask or a flip count per position, which depends on the number of conflicting pairs they are part of in P.

But this seems challenging.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem in terms of variables f_i, where f_i is 1 if position i was flipped an odd number of times during the transformation, and 0 otherwise. Then, s_i is equal to flip(p_i) if f_i is 1, else p_i. So, p_i = flip(s_i) if f_i is 1, else s_i.

But f_i is determined by the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i. So, f_i is (number of conflicting pairs in P that include i) mod 2.

But the conflicting pairs in P are the AB pairs. So, for each i, in P, if the pair (i, i+1) is AB, then both f_i and f_{i+1} are incremented by 1 (mod 2).

So, the variables f_i can be expressed as:

f_i = ( (p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B') + (p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B') ) mod 2.

But since p_i is determined by s_i and f_i (p_i = s_i if f_i is 0, else flip(s_i)), we can substitute p_i in terms of s and f.

So, substituting p_i:

p_i = s_i if f_i == 0 else 'B' if s_i == 'A' else 'A'.

So, for each pair (i, i+1), the pair (p_i, p_{i+1}) is (s_i if f_i is 0 else flipped(s_i), s_{i+1} if f_{i+1} is 0 else flipped(s_{i+1})).

We need this pair to be AB in P. So, for (i, i+1) to be a conflicting pair in P, the pair (p_i, p_{i+1}) must be AB.

But AB is A followed by B. So, p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B.

So substituting p_i and p_{i+1} in terms of s and f:

p_i = flip(s_i) if f_i is 1 else s_i.

Similarly for p_{i+1}.

So, the condition for (i, i+1) being a conflicting pair in P is:

(p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B') 

=> ( (s_i if f_i == 0 else flip(s_i)) ) == 'A' 

AND 

( (s_{i+1} if f_{i+1} == 0 else flip(s_{i+1})) ) == 'B' )

Let's define for each i, s'_i = s_i if f_i is 0, else flip(s_i). So s'_i is the value of p_i.

Then, for (i, i+1) to be a conflicting pair, we need s'_i == 'A' and s'_{i+1} == 'B'.

But this is equivalent to (s'_i, s'_{i+1}) = ('A', 'B').

So, the conflicting pair exists in P iff s'_i == 'A' and s'_{i+1} == 'B'.

But then, the f variables are defined as:

f_i = ( number of conflicting pairs in P involving i ) mod 2.

Which is equal to the sum over (i-1, i) being a conflicting pair, plus (i, i+1) being a conflicting pair, mod 2.

But since (i-1, i) being a conflicting pair depends on f_{i-1} and f_i, and similarly for (i, i+1) depending on f_i and f_{i+1}, this becomes a system of equations where each f_i is determined by neighboring f variables.

This seems like a system of equations that can be modeled as a graph, perhaps leading to a cycle of dependencies. Solving such a system for all possible f variables would give us the possible P's.

But since the problem is a circular string, the system of equations is also circular, which complicates solving it.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:

We can represent the possible flip patterns (f_i) as a binary array (each f_i is 0 or 1). For each possible flip pattern, we can check if it satisfies the constraints derived from the conflicting pair conditions.

But with n up to 100, trying all possible 2^100 flip patterns is impossible.

So, we need a smarter approach.

Let me think again. The key equation is:

f_i = [ (p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B') + (p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B') ] mod 2.

But p_i can be expressed in terms of s and f_i: p_i = s_i if f_i is 0, else flip(s_i).

So substituting this into the equation for f_i:

f_i = [ ( (s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} is 0 else flip(s_{i-1})) ) == 'A' and (s_i if f_i is 0 else flip(s_i)) == 'B' ) + ( (s_i if f_i is 0 else flip(s_i)) == 'A' and (s_{i+1} if f_{i+1} is 0 else flip(s_{i+1})) ) == 'B' ) ] mod 2.

This equation is quite complex, but perhaps we can find a way to express it in terms of f variables and s.

Let's break down each term:

Term 1: (p_{i-1} == 'A') and (p_i == 'B').

But p_{i-1} is s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} is 0, else flipped(s_{i-1}).

So, (p_{i-1} == 'A') is equivalent to:

(s_{i-1} == 'A' and f_{i-1} == 0) or (s_{i-1} == 'B' and f_{i-1} == 1).

Similarly, (p_i == 'B') is equivalent to (s_i == 'B' and f_i == 0) or (s_i == 'A' and f_i == 1).

Term 1 is the product of these two conditions.

Similarly for term 2: (p_i == 'A') and (p_{i+1} == 'B').

Which is equivalent to:

(s_i == 'A' and f_i == 0) or (s_i == 'B' and f_i == 1) → for p_i == 'A'.

And (s_{i+1} == 'B' and f_{i+1} == 0) or (s_{i+1} == 'A' and f_{i+1} == 1) → for p_{i+1} == 'B'.

But this leads to a complicated system of equations involving the f variables. Solving this for all i in the circular array is challenging.

Another approach: Let's model each possible pair of consecutive flip variables (f_i, f_{i+1}) and see how they affect each other.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system where each equation for f_i depends on f_{i-1}, f_i, and f_{i+1}, and then find the possible solutions.

But this seems complicated. Let's look for patterns in the sample inputs.

Take the first sample input: s is BABBBABBA (n=9).

The possible previous states are two. Let's see what the flip patterns could be.

In the first sample, the output is 2. So there are two possible flip patterns (f arrays) that satisfy the equations.

Looking at the first sample:

s = BABBBABBA.

Let's say we want to find the possible f arrays such that for each i, the equations are satisfied.

Assuming that the flip pattern is such that for each i, f_i is determined by the conflicting pairs in P.

But this is not helpful. Let's think of this as a problem where the f variables must form a valid configuration according to the equations derived from the conflicting pairs.

Alternatively, since the problem is circular, perhaps the system of equations can be represented in terms of f variables and the constraints can be solved in a way that considers the circular nature.

But given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a system of equations and solve for f variables using dynamic programming or other methods.

Alternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's transformation:

Each flip in the previous state affects two variables (f_i and f_{i+1}), but perhaps the system can be modeled as a graph with certain constraints, leading to the possible solutions.

Wait, but let's think of the system as a set of equations where each equation connects f_i, f_{i+1}, and f_{i-1}.

But perhaps it's possible to model this as a system of equations that can be reduced and solved for variables f_0, f_1, ..., f_{n-1}.

But for a circular system, this is challenging.

Alternatively, since each equation involves three consecutive variables, perhaps the system can be solved using dynamic programming, considering the possible states of variables in a chain and handling the circular condition with some method.

Let's consider the problem as a system of equations for each i:

f_i = (a_i + b_i) mod 2,

where a_i is 1 if the pair (i-1, i) in P is conflicting (p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B'), else 0.

b_i is 1 if the pair (i, i+1) in P is conflicting (p_i == 'A' and p_{i+1} == 'B'), else 0.

But a_i is equal to whether (p_{i-1}, p_i) is AB. But p_{i-1} and p_i are determined by s_{i-1}, s_i, and f_{i-1}, f_i.

So, substituting p_{i-1} and p_i:

p_{i-1} is s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} is 0, else flipped(s_{i-1}).

p_i is s_i if f_i is 0, else flipped(s_i).

So, a_i is 1 if:

(s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} is 0 else flipped(s_{i-1})) == 'A' 

AND 

(s_i if f_i is 0 else flipped(s_i)) == 'B'.

Similarly, b_i is 1 if:

(s_i if f_i is 0 else flipped(s_i)) == 'A' 

AND 

(s_{i+1} if f_{i+1} is 0 else flipped(s_{i+1})) == 'B'.

So, each a_i and b_i is a function of f_{i-1}, f_i, f_i, and f_{i+1}.

But this seems too complex to model directly.

Alternative approach:

Let's think of each flip variable f_i as a binary variable (0 or 1), and model the equations for each i.

We can express the equation for f_i as:

f_i = (a_i + b_i) mod 2,

where a_i is 1 if (p_{i-1}, p_i) is AB → which depends on f_{i-1} and f_i.

Similarly, b_i is 1 if (p_i, p_{i+1}) is AB → which depends on f_i and f_{i+1}.

But p_i depends on s_i and f_i.

So, a_i can be written as:

a_i = 1 if ( (s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} == 0 else flip(s_{i-1})) ) == 'A' and ( (s_i if f_i == 0 else flip(s_i)) ) == 'B' ), else 0.

Similarly for b_i.

Thus, for each i, the equation is:

f_i = (a_i + b_i) mod 2.

But how can we model this in terms of f variables?

Perhaps we can precompute the possible values of a_i and b_i based on the neighboring f's and s's.

But for each pair of f_{i-1} and f_i, we can determine a_i.

For example, given s_{i-1} and s_i, and f_{i-1} and f_i, we can compute a_i.

Similarly for b_i.

So for each i, the equation for f_i depends on f_{i-1}, f_i, and f_{i+1}.

But this seems like a system of equations that's hard to solve.

Alternative idea: For each possible configuration of f variables, check if it satisfies all the equations. But this is not feasible for n up to 100.

Another approach: model the problem as a system of equations that can be represented as a linear system modulo 2, and solve for the variables. However, the equations are not linear.

But perhaps there's a way to find the constraints between the variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into individual positions and find certain patterns or properties that the possible previous states must satisfy.

Let me think of the possible previous states for each position i in s.

Suppose that in the previous state P, the character at i is p_i. After flipping according to x_i (number of conflicting pairs in P that include i), the result is s_i.

So:

s_i = p_i if x_i is even.

s_i = flip(p_i) if x_i is odd.

But x_i is the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i. And conflicting pairs are AB pairs in P.

So, for each i, x_i can be 0, 1, or 2.

But x_i is the sum of two terms: whether (i-1, i) is a conflicting pair, and whether (i, i+1) is a conflicting pair.

But again, this depends on the previous state's characters.

But the previous state's characters are related to s and the x_i's (flips).

Let's try to model this for each i:

If x_i is even, then p_i = s_i.

If x_i is odd, then p_i = flip(s_i).

But x_i is the sum of:

1. Whether (i-1, i) is AB in P.

2. Whether (i, i+1) is AB in P.

But AB in P for (i-1, i) implies that p_{i-1} is A and p_i is B.

But p_{i-1} = s_{i-1} if x_{i-1} is even, else flip(s_{i-1}).

Similarly, p_i = s_i if x_i is even, else flip(s_i).

So, the condition for (i-1, i) being AB in P is:

p_{i-1} == 'A' and p_i == 'B'.

Substituting:

if x_{i-1} is even → p_{i-1} = s_{i-1}.

if x_{i-1} is odd → p_{i-1} = flip(s_{i-1}).

Similarly for p_i.

So, for (i-1, i) to be AB in P, we must have:

(s_{i-1} if x_{i-1} even else flip(s_{i-1})) == 'A' 

AND 

(s_i if x_i even else flip(s_i)) == 'B'.

This is a complex condition involving x_{i-1} and x_i.

But x_i is the sum of the two terms: the (i-1, i) pair and the (i, i+1) pair.

So, each x_i is determined by the pair conditions in P, which are in turn determined by x_{i-1}, x_i, and x_{i+1}.

This creates a circular dependency that is difficult to model.

Alternative idea: since the transformation is applied once, the possible previous states P can be determined by considering which positions were flipped an odd number of times (based on the conflicting pairs in P). So for each position i in s, the previous state's character is s_i XOR flip_count_i mod 2.

But the flip_count_i is determined by the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i.

But again, this is a loop.

Another approach is to realize that the problem is similar to solving a system of equations where each equation depends on neighboring variables, and the system is circular. This can be handled with dynamic programming, but for a circular system, the approach is to break the circularity by fixing a variable and propagating the constraints, then checking for consistency.

For example, we can assume a value for f_0 (the flip variable for position 0), and then compute the values of f_1, f_2, ..., f_{n-1} based on the equations. After computing all variables, we check if the circular condition is satisfied (i.e., the value for f_{n-1} is compatible with f_0).

This approach is feasible for small n, but for n up to 100, it's manageable because each step is O(n), and there are only two possible values for f_0.

So, the steps would be:

1. Assume a value for f_0 (0 or 1).

2. Compute f_1 based on f_0 and the equation derived from the previous state.

3. Compute f_2 based on f_1 and f_0, and so on.

But how to derive the equations for f_i in terms of previous variables.

Let's try to find a way to express f_i in terms of f_{i-1} and f_{i+1}.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations can be rearranged to express f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and f_{i-1}.

But this requires solving for each equation.

Alternatively, let's consider that each equation for f_i is:

f_i = a_i + b_i mod 2.

Where a_i is whether (i-1, i) is AB in P, and b_i is whether (i, i+1) is AB in P.

But a_i and b_i can be expressed in terms of the previous f variables.

But how?

Let's express a_i (whether (i-1, i) is AB in P) in terms of s and f variables.

p_{i-1} is s_{i-1} if f_{i-1} is 0, else flip(s_{i-1}).

p_i is s_i if f_i is 0, else flip(s_i).

So, (p_{i-1}, p_i) is AB → s_{i-1} (if f_{i-1} is 0) or flipped(s_{i-1}) (if f_{i-1} is 1) must be A, and s_i (if f_i is 0) or flipped(s_i) (if f_i is 1) must be B.

Similarly for b_i (whether (i, i+1) is AB in P).

So, a_i is 1 if:

(s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1}) == 'A' AND (s_i XOR f_i) == 'B'.

Similarly, b_i is 1 if:

(s_i XOR f_i) == 'A' AND (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1}) == 'B'.

Here, XOR is used to indicate flipping if f is 1.

So, the equation for f_i becomes:

f_i = [ (s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1} == 'A') AND (s_i XOR f_i == 'B') ) + ( (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') AND (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B') ) ) ] mod 2.

This is a complex equation, but perhaps we can find a way to express it in terms of f variables.

But this equation has f_i on both sides, which complicates things.

Alternatively, we can model this equation for each i and find a way to express f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and f_{i-1}.

But how?

Let's expand the equation for f_i.

Let me denote:

For each i, define:

a_i = ( (s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1}) == 'A' ) and ( (s_i XOR f_i) == 'B' )

b_i = ( (s_i XOR f_i) == 'A' ) and ( (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1}) == 'B' )

Then, f_i = (a_i + b_i) mod 2.

But this equation must hold for all i.

This seems impossible to model directly. However, perhaps for each i, the equation can be rearranged to express f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and f_{i-1}.

But this would require solving for f_{i+1} in terms of the previous variables.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each i, the equation can be expressed as:

f_i = (A_i(f_{i-1}, f_i) + B_i(f_i, f_{i+1})) ) mod 2.

But this equation has f_i on both sides, which complicates solving it.

Let me think of a specific example. Take s as "AB" (but since the minimal length is 3, but let's ignore that for this example). For each i, we need to compute a_i and b_i.

But this is getting stuck. Perhaps there's a way to model the problem in terms of the flip variables and the constraints between them, using dynamic programming.

Let's consider that for the string s, each position i has s_i. For each i, the previous state's p_i is s_i XOR f_i.

Now, the conflicting pairs in P are those where p_i is A and p_{i+1} is B. So, in terms of s and f variables, this is:

(p_i, p_{i+1}) == (A, B)

Which is:

(s_i XOR f_i) == A and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1}) == B.

Let's denote this as:

(s_i XOR f_i) is A → which means s_i is A when f_i is 0, or B when f_i is 1. So:

s_i XOR f_i == A → (s_i == A and f_i == 0) or (s_i == B and f_i == 1).

Similarly for the next character.

So, the conflicting pairs in P are those pairs (i, i+1) where the above condition is true.

Now, the number of conflicting pairs in P that include i is the sum of whether (i-1, i) is a conflicting pair and whether (i, i+1) is a conflicting pair.

But each conflicting pair in P contributes 1 to the flip count of i and i+1.

So, the flip count for i is:

c_i = number of conflicting pairs in P that include i.

c_i = ( (i-1, i) is conflicting ) + ( (i, i+1) is conflicting )

But this must equal f_i (since c_i mod 2 is f_i).

So, f_i = [ (i-1, i) is conflicting + (i, i+1) is conflicting ] mod 2.

But the conflicting pairs are determined by s and f variables.

So for each i:

f_i = ( a_i + b_i ) mod 2,

where a_i is 1 if (i-1, i) is conflicting,

and b_i is 1 if (i, i+1) is conflicting.

But a_i is determined by s_{i-1}, s_i, f_{i-1}, and f_i.

Similarly for b_i.

But this seems like a system that can be represented as a set of equations for each i, with each equation involving f_{i-1}, f_i, and f_{i+1}.

This is a system of equations that can be modeled as a graph, but solving it requires a way to handle the circular dependencies.

An alternative idea is to model this as a graph where each node represents the state (f_{i-1}, f_i) and edges represent transitions to the next state (f_i, f_{i+1}).

We can then use dynamic programming to track the possible states as we move along the string.

But since the string is circular, the last transition must connect back to the first state.

This approach is commonly used in problems involving circular dependencies, such as the necklace problem or certain types of dynamic programming with cycles.

Let's outline the steps:

1. The string is circular, so the first and last elements are adjacent.

2. For each position i (from 0 to n-1), the state is determined by the values of f_{i-1} and f_i.

3. The transitions between states are determined by the equations that must hold for the current i.

4. We can model this as a graph where each node is a possible pair (f_{i-1}, f_i), and edges represent valid transitions to (f_i, f_{i+1}).

5. After processing all positions, the final state must connect back to the initial state, ensuring the circular condition.

6. The number of valid cycles in this graph is the answer.

But implementing this requires careful modeling of the transitions.

Let's try to model this for a single position i.

At position i, the variables are:

prev_prev = f_{i-2}

prev = f_{i-1}

current = f_i

next = f_{i+1}

But for the dynamic programming approach, we can model the state as (prev_prev, prev), and compute transitions to (prev, current).

But perhaps a better way is to model the state as (prev, current), and for each position i, determine the possible next state (current, next).

But for this to work, we need to derive next based on the equations.

Let's proceed step by step.

For each i, the equation is:

f_i = a_i + b_i mod 2.

Where a_i is 1 if (i-1, i) is conflicting, and b_i is 1 if (i, i+1) is conflicting.

But (i-1, i) is conflicting iff (s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1} == 'A') and (s_i XOR f_i == 'B').

So, a_i = 1 if this condition holds.

Similarly, (i, i+1) is conflicting iff (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B').

So, b_i = 1 if this condition holds.

So, substituting into the equation for f_i:

f_i = [ (a_i + b_i) ] mod 2.

But this equation involves f_{i+1} (since b_i depends on f_{i+1}).

Rearranging this equation to express f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and f_{i-1} may be possible.

But how?

Let's expand the equation.

We have:

f_i = ( a_i + b_i ) mod 2.

But a_i is 1 if (s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1} == 'A') and (s_i XOR f_i == 'B').

So, a_i is a boolean (0 or 1) based on the previous and current f values.

Similarly, b_i is 1 if (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B').

So, the equation for f_i is:

f_i = ( [condition for a_i] + [condition for b_i] ) mod 2.

But this equation involves f_{i+1} (in the condition for b_i).

To express f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and f_{i-1}, we can rearrange the equation.

But this is non-trivial. Let's see:

Assume that the equation is:

f_i = a_i + b_i mod 2.

But b_i is a function of f_i and f_{i+1}.

So:

b_i = ( (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B') ).

Thus, the equation becomes:

f_i = [a_i + ( (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B') ) ] mod 2.

But solving for f_{i+1} in terms of f_i and a_i is possible.

Let's consider the possible values of (s_i XOR f_i == 'A') and (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B').

Let's denote:

A_i = (s_i XOR f_i) == 'A' → s_i is 'A' when f_i is 0, or s_i is 'B' when f_i is 1.

B_i_plus_1 = (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1}) == 'B' → s_{i+1} is 'B' when f_{i+1} is 0, or s_{i+1} is 'A' when f_{i+1} is 1.

So, B_i_plus_1 can be rewritten as (s_{i+1} == 'B' and f_{i+1} == 0) or (s_{i+1} == 'A' and f_{i+1} == 1).

So, the equation for f_i becomes:

f_i = [a_i + (A_i and B_i_plus_1)] mod 2.

We can rearrange this to solve for B_i_plus_1.

Rearranging:

B_i_plus_1 = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

But since B_i_plus_1 is a boolean (0 or 1), this gives:

If (f_i - a_i) mod 2 is 1, then B_i_plus_1 must be 1.

If (f_i - a_i) mod 2 is 0, then B_i_plus_1 must be 0.

So, B_i_plus_1 = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

But B_i_plus_1 is a function of s_{i+1} and f_{i+1}:

B_i_plus_1 = (s_{i+1} XOR f_{i+1} == 'B').

Which can be rewritten as:

(s_{i+1} == 'B' and f_{i+1} == 0) or (s_{i+1} == 'A' and f_{i+1} == 1).

But this depends on f_{i+1} and s_{i+1}.

So, combining these two expressions for B_i_plus_1:

(s_{i+1} == 'B' and f_{i+1} == 0) or (s_{i+1} == 'A' and f_{i+1} == 1) = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

Let's denote the right-hand side as K = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

So:

if K is 1:

(s_{i+1} == 'B' and f_{i+1} == 0) or (s_{i+1} == 'A' and f_{i+1} == 1) must be true.

if K is 0:

The above condition must be false.

But how can we solve for f_{i+1} given K and s_{i+1}?

Let's consider each case:

Case 1: K = 1.

Then, the condition for B_i_plus_1 is true.

So, if s_{i+1} is 'B', then f_{i+1} must be 0.

Or if s_{i+1} is 'A', then f_{i+1} must be 1.

Case 2: K = 0.

Then, the condition for B_i_plus_1 is false.

So, if s_{i+1} is 'B', then f_{i+1} must be 1.

Or if s_{i+1} is 'A', then f_{i+1} must be 0.

Thus, for each i, given K (computed as (f_i - a_i) mod 2), and s_{i+1}, there is a unique value for f_{i+1} that satisfies the equation.

But this depends on s_{i+1}.

So, for example:

If K is 1 and s_{i+1} is 'B', then f_{i+1} must be 0.

If K is 1 and s_{i+1} is 'A', then f_{i+1} must be 1.

If K is 0 and s_{i+1} is 'B', then f_{i+1} must be 1.

If K is 0 and s_{i+1} is 'A', then f_{i+1} must be 0.

This gives us a way to compute f_{i+1} based on K and s_{i+1}.

But K is (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

And a_i is computed as:

a_i = 1 if (s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1} == 'A') and (s_i XOR f_i == 'B').

But this depends on f_{i-1} and f_i.

So, given the previous state (f_{i-1}, f_i), we can compute a_i, then K = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

Then, based on K and s_{i+1}, we can compute f_{i+1}.

Thus, the transition from (f_{i-1}, f_i) to (f_i, f_{i+1}) can be determined.

This suggests that we can model the problem using dynamic programming, where the state is (prev, current), and for each step, we compute the possible next state (current, next).

This approach can be implemented as follows:

- Precompute the transitions for each possible (prev, current) state and current character in the string.

- Iterate through each character in the string, tracking the possible states.

- After processing all characters, check if the final state connects back to the initial state (due to the circular nature).

So, let's outline the steps:

1. For each possible starting state (prev, current) = (f0, f1), compute the possible transitions through the string.

But since the string is circular, the first and last elements are connected. Therefore, the starting state must be (f_{n-1}, f_0) for the last step.

This seems complex, but we can model this by trying all possible initial states and checking for consistency.

The steps are:

- For each possible initial state (f0, f1):

   a. Compute f2 based on f0, f1, and s.

   b. Compute f3 based on f1, f2, and s.

   c. Continue this until f_{n} is computed (but since it's a circle, f_{n} is f0).

   d. Check if the computed f0 matches the initial assumption.

But this approach is O(2^2 * n) = O(4n), which is feasible for n up to 100.

But this would only work if the initial assumption for (f0, f1) can lead to a consistent solution.

But wait, the initial state for i=0 would require f_{-1} (which is f_{n-1} due to the circularity). So perhaps the correct way is to model the state as (f_{i-1}, f_i) and iterate through the entire string, then check if the final state (f_{n-1}, f0) is compatible with the initial state.

But how to handle this?

An alternative approach is to try all possible pairs (f0, f1) and simulate the transitions for the entire string. After processing all characters, check if the computed (f_{n-1}, f0) forms a valid transition back to (f0, f1).

But this would require trying all 4 possible initial pairs (since each f is a bit).

Let's formalize this:

For each possible initial pair (f0, f1):

   Compute f2 based on (f0, f1), s[0], s[1], s[2].

   Then compute f3 based on (f1, f2), s[1], s[2], s[3].

   Continue until f_{n-1} is computed.

   Then compute f0' based on (f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}, s[n-2], s[n-1], s[0]).

   Check if f0' equals the initial f0.

But this approach requires handling the circularity properly, and ensuring that the last transition connects back to the initial state.

But how to compute each f_{i+1} from (f_{i-1}, f_i) and s.

Let's work through an example.

Suppose we're at position i, which is 0-based. The current state is (f_{i-1}, f_i).

To compute f_{i+1}:

   Compute a_i = whether (i-1, i) in P is a conflicting pair.

   a_i is 1 if:

      s_{i-1} XOR f_{i-1} == 'A' and s_i XOR f_i == 'B'.

   K = (f_i - a_i) mod 2.

   Then, based on K and s_{i+1}, determine f_{i+1}.

   For example, if K is 1 and s_{i+1} is 'A', then f_{i+1} must be 1.

Thus, the algorithm for computing f_{i+1} is:

def compute_next(f_prev, f_current, s_prev, s_current, s_next):

    # Compute a_i: whether (i-1, i) is AB in P.

    p_prev = s_prev if f_prev == 0 else 'B' if s_prev == 'A' else 'A'

    p_current = s_current if f_current == 0 else 'B' if s_current == 'A' else 'A'

    a_i = 1 if (p_prev == 'A' and p_current == 'B') else 0

    K = (f_current - a_i) % 2

    # Determine f_next based on K and s_next.

    if K == 1:

        # B_i_plus_1 must be True.

        # So s_next XOR f_next == 'B'

        if s_next == 'B':

            f_next = 0

        else:

            f_next = 1

    else:

        # B_i_plus_1 must be False.

        # So s_next XOR f_next != 'B'

        if s_next == 'B':

            f_next = 1

        else:

            f_next = 0

    return f_next

So, given f_prev (f_{i-1}), f_current (f_i), and s_prev (s[i-1]), s_current (s[i]), s_next (s[i+1]), we can compute f_next (f_{i+1}).

But for the circular case, when i == n-1, the next is 0.

But in the code, for each step i, we compute f_{i+1} based on s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] (wait, no. s_prev is s[i-1], s_current is s[i], s_next is s[i+1]).

So, for position i in 0..n-1, s_prev is s[i-1], s_current is s[i], s_next is s[i+1]. For the last position i = n-1, s_next is s[0] (since it's a circle).

So, for each i from 0 to n-1:

   compute f_{i+1} as per the function.

But f_{i+1} is the next in the sequence. So for i=0, we compute f_2 based on f_0, f_1.

But this approach assumes that the transitions are computed sequentially.

So, the algorithm would be:

for each possible (f0, f1) in {0,1}^2:

   compute f2 based on f0, f1, s[0], s[1], s[2].

   compute f3 based on f1, f2, s[1], s[2], s[3}.

   continue until compute f_{n} (which is f0).

   check if computed f_{n} equals f0.

   if yes, then check if the transition from (f_{n-1}, f0) to (f0, f1) is valid.

Wait, no. The last step would be to compute f_{n} based on f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}, s_{n-2}, s_{n-1}, s[0}.

But this depends on how the indices are managed.

Alternatively, for each initial (f0, f1), compute f2, f3, ..., f_{n-1}, and then compute f0' using the last step (based on f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}, s_{n-1}, s[0}, s[1}).

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, we can model the entire process as a chain, with the initial state (f0, f1), and compute the entire chain up to f_{n-1}, and then check if the transition from (f_{n-1}, f0) to (f0, f1) is valid.

But how?

Let's think:

For a string of length n, the positions are 0..n-1.

For each position i in 0..n-1:

   compute f_{i+1} based on f_{i-1}, f_i, s[i-1], s[i], s[i+1].

But for i=0, i-1 is n-1.

But this makes the problem circular.

But if we assume initial values for f0 and f1, then compute f2, f3, ..., f_{n-1}, and then compute f0' (based on f_{n-1}, f0, s[n-1], s[0}, s[1}).

We then check if this computed f0' matches the original f0.

If yes, then this is a valid solution.

But how to model this?

For each possible initial pair (f0, f1):

   current_prev = f0

   current = f1

   for i in 1 to n-1:

       s_prev = s[i-1]

       s_current = s[i]

       s_next = s[i+1] if i+1 < n else s[0]

       next_f = compute_next(current_prev, current, s_prev, s_current, s_next)

       current_prev, current = current, next_f

   # After processing all positions, check the last step.

   # Now, to compute f0', we need to process the last transition from i = n-1.

   # For i = n-1:

   s_prev = s[n-2]

   s_current = s[n-1]

   s_next = s[0]

   next_f = compute_next(current_prev, current, s_prev, s_current, s_next)

   # next_f should be the new f0.

   if next_f == f0:

       # Also, need to check if the transition from i = n-1 to i=0 is valid.

       # For the circular condition, after processing i=n-1, the next step would be i=0.

       # For i=0:

       s_prev = s[n-1]

       s_current = s[0]

       s_next = s[1]

       next_f_0 = compute_next(current_prev, current, s_prev, s_current, s_next)

       # wait, this is not necessary. We already computed next_f as the f0', which should equal f0.

       # So, the condition is that next_f == f0.

       # Additionally, the pair (current_prev, current) (which is f_{n-1}, f0) must transition to (f0, f1) when processing i=0.

       # For this, after processing i=n-1, the current_prev is f_{n-2}, current is f_{n-1}.

       # When processing i=0, the current_prev is f_{n-1}, current is f0.

       # The next_f would be f1, which must equal the initial f1.

       # So, after processing i=0, we compute f1' and check if it equals f1.

       # So, the code would be:

       # After processing all positions up to i=n-1:

       # Now, to check the transition for i=0:

       # current_prev is f_{n-1}, current is f0.

       # s_prev = s[n-1], s_current = s[0], s_next = s[1].

       # compute next_f = compute_next(current_prev, current, s_prev, s_current, s_next).

       # next_f should be f1.

       # So, the full condition is next_f == f1 and next_f0 == f0.

       # But this requires additional steps.

       # After the initial loop, current_prev is f_{n-2}, current is f_{n-1}.

       # When processing i=n-1, next_f is f0.

       # So, after the loop, current_prev is f_{n-2}, current is f_{n-1}, and next_f is f0.

       # Now, for i=0:

       # Compute next_f1 = compute_next(f_{n-1}, f0, s[n-1], s[0], s[1}).

       # This next_f1 should be equal to the initial f1.

       # So, the full conditions are:

       # next_f == f0 (the f0' computed after processing i=n-1) 

       # and compute_next(f_{n-1}, f0, s[n-1], s[0}, s[1}) == f1.

       # But how to compute this?

       # It's getting complicated.

       # Perhaps after the initial loop, we need to compute the next transition to get f1' and check if it equals f1.

       # So, after the loop, the current state is (current_prev, current) = (f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}).

       # Then, compute next_f0 = compute_next(current_prev, current, s[n-2}, s[n-1}, s[0}).

       # Then, current_prev and current become (current, next_f0) = (f_{n-1}, f0).

       # Then, compute next_f1 = compute_next(f_{n-1}, f0, s[n-1}, s[0}, s[1}).

       # check if next_f0 == f0 and next_f1 == f1.

       # But this is getting quite involved.

       # So, for the initial (f0, f1):

       # compute all f's up to f_{n-1}, and then compute f0' and f1' and check if they match the initial f0 and f1.

       # This would ensure that the entire circular system is consistent.

So, the steps for each initial (f0, f1) are:

1. Initialize f = [f0, f1].

2. For i in 1 to n-2:

   a. Compute f[i+1] using compute_next(f[i-1], f[i], s[i-1], s[i], s[i+1]).

3. After processing i = n-2, f has length n-1.

4. Compute f0' = compute_next(f[n-3], f[n-2}, s[n-3}, s[n-2}, s[0}).

5. Check if f0' == f0.

6. Compute f1' = compute_next(f[n-2}, f0', s[n-2}, s[0}, s[1}).

7. Check if f1' == f1.

8. If both checks pass, then this initial (f0, f1) is valid, and the corresponding P is a valid previous state.

Thus, for each possible (f0, f1), if the computed sequence satisfies these conditions, it contributes to the answer.

Each valid initial (f0, f1) corresponds to a unique valid P, and the total number of such valid (f0, f1) pairs is the answer.

But wait, each valid (f0, f1) pair corresponds to a possible P. But some initial pairs may lead to the same P. No, because the flip variables uniquely determine P. Each P is determined by flipping s_i according to f_i. So each valid (f0, f1) pair corresponds to exactly one P, but multiple initial pairs may not lead to a valid solution.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

For each possible (f0, f1) in {0, 1} x {0, 1}:

   compute the sequence f_2, f_3, ..., f_{n-1}, f0', f1'.

   if f0' == f0 and f1' == f1:

       increment the answer count.

But how to compute this?

Let's implement this step by step.

First, for each (f0, f1):

   We create a list of f's, starting with [f0, f1].

   For i from 1 to n-2:

       compute f_{i+1} using compute_next(f_{i-1}, f_i, s[i-1], s[i], s[i+1]).

   After this, we have f_0, f_1, f_2, ..., f_{n-1} (up to index n-1).

   Then compute f0' = compute_next(f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}, s[n-2}, s[n-1}, s[0}).

   Check if f0' equals the initial f0.

   Then compute f1' = compute_next(f_{n-1}, f0', s[n-1}, s[0}, s[1}).

   Check if f1' equals the initial f1.

   If both conditions are true, then this (f0, f1) is a valid solution, and contributes to the count.

The total number of valid (f0, f1) pairs is the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(4 * n), which is acceptable for n up to 100.

Now, the code can be written as follows:

Implement the compute_next function as described.

Loop over all possible (f0, f1) pairs.

For each pair, simulate the process and check the conditions.

If valid, increment the answer.

Finally, output the answer.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

BABBBABBA → output 2.

Sample Input 2:

ABABB → output 2.

Sample Input 3:

ABABAB → output 4.

Let's take sample input 2: ABABB (n=5).

Let's see how the code would process this.

But this requires a detailed walkthrough, which is time-consuming. However, the code should correctly handle these cases.

Now, the code:

We need to implement the compute_next function, which, given f_prev, f_current, s_prev, s_current, s_next, returns f_next.

Then, for each possible (f0, f1), simulate the steps.

The code would look something like this:

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)

count = 0

for f0 in [0, 1]:

    for f1 in [0, 1]:

        # Initialize the array of flips. We only need to track the previous two.

        prev_prev = f0

        prev = f1

        valid = True

        # Compute f2, f3, ..., f_{n-1}

        for i in range(1, n-1):

            s_prev = s[i-1]

            s_current = s[i]

            s_next = s[i+1]

            # Compute a_i: whether (i-1, i) is AB in P.

            p_prev = 'A' if (s_prev == 'A' and (prev_prev == 0)) or (s_prev == 'B' and (prev_prev == 1)) else 'B'

            p_current = 'A' if (s_current == 'A' and (prev == 0)) or (s_current == 'B' and (prev == 1)) else 'B'

            else:

        # Now compute f0' = compute_next(f_{n-2}, f_{n-1}, s_{n-2}, s_{n-1}, s[0])

        s_prev = s[n-2]

        s_current = s[n-1]

        s_next = s[0]

            else:

        else:

        p_prev = 'A' if (s_prev == 'A' and (prev == 0)) or (s_prev == 'B' and (prev == 1)) else 'B'

        p_current = 'A' if (s_current == 'A' and (f0 == 0)) or (s_current == 'B' and (f0 == 1)) else 'B'

        a_i = 1 if (p_prev == 'A' and p_current == 'B') else 0

        K = (f0 - a_i) % 2

        if K == 1:

        # Check if f_next_f1 == f1

        if f_next_f1 == f1:

            count += 1

print(count)
