Okay, let's see. The problem is to calculate the number of steps needed for a given binary number x to reach 1 by following certain rules. The rules are: if x is odd, add 1; if even, divide by 2. We need to find the minimum number of operations required.

Hmm, first, I need to process the input, which is a binary string. So the input is something like "101110", which is 46 in decimal. Then, the steps for that example are 8. Let's look at the example:

For 101110 (46):
- Even, divide by 2 → 23 (10111) → 1 operation.
- 23 is odd → add 1 → 24 (11000) → 2nd operation.
- Then divide by 2 three times (24 →12→6→3) → 3 operations, total 5 so far.
- 3 is odd → add 1 →4 → 6th operation.
- Divide by 2 twice →4→2→1. That's two more steps. Total 6+2=8? Wait the example's output is 8. So yeah, the steps add up correctly.

The challenge is to compute this efficiently, given that the binary string can be up to 1e6 digits long. Converting that to a decimal integer isn't feasible because it's way too big. So we need a way to process the binary string as a bit array, and simulate the steps without converting it to a huge number.

So how can we model this process?

Let's think about the operations. When the number is even (ends with 0), we divide by 2 (right shift). When it's odd (ends with 1), we add 1. But adding 1 can cause a chain of carries. For example, 1111 (15) becomes 10000 (16) when adding 1. Then you can divide by 2 four times, which is 4 steps.

The key is to find, for each position, whether adding 1 and then performing divisions is better than subtracting 1 (but wait, the problem says when the number is odd, add 1, not subtract). Oh right, according to the problem statement, when x is odd, you must add 1. So there's no choice here. So the steps are determined by the algorithm, not by choosing between options. So the path is fixed once you start processing.

Wait, but for example, when x is 3. Steps: add 1 to get 4 (1 step), then divide three times (total 4 steps). But if we could subtract 1 (but the problem doesn't allow that), it would take fewer steps. But according to the problem's rules, you have to add 1 when it's odd. So the steps are deterministic.

So the problem is to simulate the process as per the rules and count the steps, but doing so efficiently for very large binary numbers.

The approach can't be to process the number step by step for each operation, because for a number like 2^1e6, dividing by 2 each time would take O(n) steps, which is 1e6 steps, and that's acceptable? Wait, but if the input is 1e6 bits, and each step could take O(1) time, then 1e6 steps would be manageable. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's think of the binary string as a list of bits. Let's process it from the least significant bit (right) to the most significant (left), or maybe from left to right. Let's see.

Let's model the binary digits as a list, perhaps reversed (so that the first element is the least significant bit). For example, the binary string '101' (5) would be stored as [1,0,1] in reversed order (LSB first). Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, the binary string is given as a standard string, where the first character is the most significant bit. For example, '101110' represents 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 46.

So the first character is the highest bit.

But when processing, perhaps it's easier to process from the LSB. But for adding 1, the carries propagate to the left (higher bits). So maybe storing the bits in a list with the least significant bit first (i.e., reversed) would make operations like adding 1 easier. Because when you add 1 to a binary number, you start from the right.

So for example, '1011' (11) is stored as [1,1,0,1] in reversed order (LSB first). Then adding 1 would go through the list, flipping bits until a 0 is found. Let's see:

Original bits (reversed): 1,1,0,1 → which is 11 (1011). Adding 1:

Start at first bit (LSB). It's 1 → flip to 0, carry over. Next bit is 1 → flip to 0, carry. Next is 0 → flip to 1, no carry. So the new bits are [0,0,1,1]. Wait, but reversed order, so the bits are now 0011 → which is 3, but 11+1=12, which is 1100. Oh wait, reversed order would make the original number 1011 → bits in reversed order: 1,1,0,1 (LSB to MSB). Adding 1 would make it 0011 in reversed order, which is 1100 in original order → 12. Yes, that works.

So representing the bits as a list in reversed order (LSB first) might be easier for adding 1 and dividing by 2.

Let's model the steps:

At each step, if the current number is even (LSB is 0), divide by 2 (remove the LSB). That's O(1) step. If it's odd (LSB is 1), add 1, which may cause a carry. Then, after adding 1, the number becomes even (since adding 1 to an odd number makes it even), so the next step is to divide by 2. So adding 1 and then dividing by 2 can be considered as a single combined operation, but let's see.

Wait, for example, when x is odd:

Step 1: add 1 → x becomes even. That's +1 operation.

Step 2: divide by 2 → +1 operation.

So for each odd number, two operations are needed (unless after adding 1, the number is 2, then dividing once gives 1, so two steps).

But in the case where adding 1 to an odd number leads to a number that has trailing zeros. For example, 11 (binary 1011) → add 1 → 1100 (12). Then we can divide by 2 three times (since there are two trailing zeros? Wait 12 in binary is 1100, which has two trailing zeros. So dividing by 2 three times? Wait 12 →6 (1 op), 3 (2nd op), but 3 is odd again. Wait no, wait:

Wait, no. Wait, after adding 1 to 11 (3), you get 4 (100). Then you can divide by 2 twice. So in that case, adding 1 (1 op), then dividing by 2 (twice, 2 ops), total 3 ops. So the steps here are: add 1 (1), divide (2 more steps). So for the original 3, three steps.

Hmm, but perhaps when adding 1 to an odd number, the resulting number is even, but may have multiple trailing zeros. So when that happens, the number of divisions is the number of trailing zeros plus one? Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Suppose x is an odd number. Adding 1 makes it even, and the number may end with k zeros. So dividing by 2 once gives a number that ends with k-1 zeros, but that number could be even again. Wait, no. For example, x = 7 (111). Adding 1 gives 1000 (8). Dividing by 2 once gives 4 (100), which is even. So in this case, after adding 1, you can divide by 2 three times (since 8 is 2^3). So when you add 1 to an odd number, you get a number that is 2^k. Then you can divide by 2 exactly k times to get 1. So the steps would be: add 1 (1 step), then k steps for dividing.

So for example, x = 3 (11):

Add 1 → 4 (100) → 2 steps (add 1, then divide by 2 twice). Wait, the steps are:

3 → add 1 → 4 (1 step)

4 → divide → 2 (2 steps)

2 → divide → 1 (3 steps). So total 3 steps.

Yes, that's correct.

So when processing an odd number, adding 1 and then dividing by 2 as many times as possible (until the number becomes 1) would take 1 + k steps, where k is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of x+1.

Wait, no. Because x+1 is even, so after adding 1, we have to divide by 2 once (since the next step is even). But after that division, the number could be even again. For example, x=7 (111). x+1=1000. Dividing by 2 once gives 100 (4), which is even again. So each division step is done until you reach 1.

But perhaps when you add 1 to an odd x, the result is x+1, which is even. So you do two steps: add 1, then divide by 2. But that's two steps for that.

But in the case of x+1 being a power of two, the number of trailing zeros is log2(x+1) - 1. Wait, for example, x+1=8=2^3, the trailing zeros in binary 1000 are 3. So after adding 1, you can divide by 2 three times to reach 1. So the steps are add 1 (1 step) plus three divisions (3 steps) → total 4 steps for x=7.

Wait, but wait:

x=7 → add 1 (step 1) → 8.

Then divide by 2 three times (steps 2,3,4) → 8→4→2→1. So 4 steps.

Yes.

So the process when x is odd is: add 1 (1 step), then divide by 2 until 1 (k steps, where x+1 = 2^k → k steps). But how do we compute the number of steps for that?

But how to model this for a binary string?

An alternative approach is to process the binary digits from right to left, tracking the current position and the number of steps required.

Let's consider the binary digits as a list. For example, for the input '101110', the binary digits are 1 0 1 1 1 0 (MSB first). Reversed, it's 0 1 1 1 0 1 (LSB first).

Wait, perhaps processing the bits in reverse order (LSB first) would be easier. Let's see.

The algorithm could proceed as follows:

1. Start with the binary string, reversed. So the first element is the LSB.

2. Traverse the bits from left (LSB) to right (MSB), processing each group of consecutive 1s and 0s.

But how?

Wait, let's think about the steps again. Let's model the binary number as a list of bits (reversed order), and process it step by step.

For even numbers (LSB is 0):

- Divide by 2 → remove the LSB (since it's a 0). This takes 1 step.

For odd numbers (LSB is 1):

- Add 1, which flips the bits starting from the LSB until a 0 is found (with carry). Then divide by 2 once. But adding 1 to a binary number that's odd (ends with 1) will result in a carry that propagates until a 0 is turned into 1, and all the 1s turned into 0s. For example, 11 (binary 1011) → adding 1 gives 1100 (binary). So in the reversed list (LSB first), the original is [1,1,0,1], adding 1 would change the leading 1s to 0s until a 0 is found. So the list becomes [0,0,1,1].

Wait, but in the reversed list, the bits are:

Original (1011): reversed is [1,1,0,1] (since the original is 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0).

Adding 1:

Start with the first bit (LSB). It's 1 → set to 0, carry over. Next bit is 1 → set to 0, carry. Next is 0 → set to 1, carry stops. The rest (fourth bit) is 1. So after adding 1, the reversed list becomes [0,0,1,1]. So the actual number is 1100 (binary) → 12 in decimal. Then, dividing by 2 once would remove the LSB (0), making it 110 (6). But wait, dividing by 2 after adding 1 would take one step, but in reality, adding 1 and then dividing once would be two steps.

But after adding 1, the number is even, so the next step is to divide by 2. So for an odd number, the steps are add 1 (1 step), then divide by 2 (another step). So two steps.

But when adding 1 leads to a number with multiple trailing zeros, like in the example where adding 1 to 7 (111) gives 1000 (8), which has three trailing zeros. So when you divide by 2 three times, that's three steps. So adding 1 (1 step) and three divisions (3 steps) → total 4 steps.

But how to model this efficiently for a binary string of up to 1e6 bits?

The key insight here is that when we have a run of trailing 1s in the binary representation (in the LSB positions), adding 1 to such a number will flip all those 1s to 0s and add a 1 to the next bit. For example:

Original bits (reversed order): [1,1,1, ... , 0]. Adding 1 turns those 1s into 0s, and the first 0 becomes 1. So the number becomes a power of two (if there were k trailing 1s, then the new number is 2^(k+1)).

So, when processing an odd number (ends with 1), we need to:

- Add 1 (1 step)
- Then, divide by 2 until the number becomes 1. The number of divisions would be the position of the next set bit after the trailing 1s.

Wait, perhaps the number of trailing 1s in the current number (before adding 1) is m. Then adding 1 will flip all those m 1s to 0s, and increment the next bit. So the new number has m trailing 0s and a 1 in the (m+1)th position. So when we divide by 2 once, we remove one zero, but since there are m zeros, we can divide m times. Wait, no. Because after adding 1, the number is even (so we divide once, then after that, the next number may be even again, etc.

Wait, after adding 1 to an odd number, the resulting number is even. So in the next step, we divide by 2 once. So for example, if after adding 1, the number has m trailing zeros, then we can divide by 2 m times, but each division is one step.

But how to compute m, which is the number of trailing zeros in (x+1). For example, x is 7 (111), x+1 is 8 (1000). The number of trailing zeros is 3, so m=3. So the steps after adding 1 are 3 steps (divisions by 2).

But adding 1 and then dividing m times gives a total of 1 + m steps.

So in the example of x=7, the steps are 1 + 3 = 4 steps.

But how do we compute m for a given binary number?

m is the number of trailing 1s in the original number. Because when you add 1 to a number that ends with m 1s, those 1s become 0s, and a carry is generated. So the trailing zeros in x+1 are equal to the number of trailing 1s in x.

Yes. For example:

x=3 (11) → two trailing 1s. x+1=4 (100) → two trailing zeros.

So m = number of trailing 1s in x.

So when x is odd, the steps are 1 (add) + (m + 1) steps (divisions), where m is the number of trailing 1s. Wait, why +1?

Wait, after adding 1, the number becomes x+1, which is even. So after adding 1 (step 1), you divide once (step 2), but if x+1 is 1000 (8), then after dividing once, you get 4 (100), which is even again. So each division step is another step. So for x=7 (111), adding 1 gives 1000 (step 1), then dividing three times (steps 2,3,4) to reach 1.

So the number of steps after adding 1 is equal to the number of trailing zeros in x+1. Because x+1 has m trailing zeros (where m is the number of trailing 1s in x), so dividing by 2 m times gives 1. So steps are 1 (add) + m (divisions) steps.

So for each odd number, the steps are 1 + m, where m is the number of trailing 1s.

But if after adding 1, the number becomes a power of two, then dividing m times (m being the number of trailing zeros) leads to 1. But m is the number of trailing 1s in the original number.

So the key is to find, for each odd number, the number of trailing 1s, then add 1 and m steps. Then, after that, the resulting number is (x+1)/2^m, which is even again, but perhaps we can proceed.

Wait, perhaps the process is more complex. Let's take an example:

Let's say the binary number is 1011 (11 in decimal).

The steps would be:

Step 1: add 1 → 1100 (12) → 1 step.

Then divide by 2 once (step 2) → 6 (110).

Step 3: divide by 2 again → 3 (11) → which is odd again.

So after two steps (adding 1 and dividing once), we have to process the new number 3 again.

But in this case, the number of trailing 1s in the original (11) is two. So m=2. Then steps after adding 1 would be 2 steps (1 for add, 2 divisions) → but in reality, after adding 1 (steps 1) and dividing once (step 2), we get 6, which is even. Then divide again (step 3) to get 3, which is odd → again need to add 1.

So the original approach of adding 1 and m steps may not be sufficient because after adding 1 and dividing m steps, the next number may be another odd.

Wait, this suggests that the process needs to be simulated step by step. But for very large numbers, this is not feasible. So there must be a way to model the entire process in terms of the binary digits.

Alternative approach: consider the binary digits in reverse order (LSB first) and track the number of steps as we process each bit.

For example:

- When a bit is 0, it's even, so we can divide by 2 (remove the 0, step increases by 1).
- When a bit is 1, but followed by a 0 (i.e., the next bit is 0), then this is the trailing 1. So adding 1 would flip this 1 to 0, and the next 0 to 1. Then the number of trailing 1s is 1, so steps for this is 1 (add) + 1 (divisions) = 2 steps. But after that, the next bit is 1 (from the carry), and we can process that.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as follows:

We process the bits from LSB to MSB (reverse order). Let's track the number of steps, and the current position.

Let's have a list of bits in reversed order.

Initialize steps = 0.

We have a carry variable that may be set when processing a group of 1s.

Wait, let's think of it this way:

We traverse the bits from left (LSB) to right (MSB) in the reversed list.

We need to find the number of trailing 1s when we encounter a 1.

Wait, for example, reversed list is [0,1,1,1,0,1]. So the original bits are 101110 (which is the third example in the problem statement).

Processing:

We start from the first bit (LSB) which is 0. Since it's 0, the number is even. So we can divide by 2 (steps +=1), and remove this bit. Now the bits are [1,1,1,0,1].

But in this case, the original example's steps for this part are:

101110 (46) → divide by 2 once (step 1) → becomes 10111 (23) → which is odd.

Then, add 1 (step 2) → 11000 (24). Then divide by 2 three times (steps 3,4,5) → 3, which is odd again.

So perhaps the reversed approach is not the best.

Alternative idea: the optimal strategy is to process the binary string as a list, and whenever we encounter a group of 1s followed by a 0, we can calculate the steps required to handle that group.

Let me see.

The binary number can be divided into segments of consecutive 1s and 0s. For example, the third example, 101110 (binary 46) is 101110, which can be broken down as 1, 0, 111, 0. Wait, no. Let's see:

The binary string is '101110', which is 1 followed by 0, followed by 111, followed by 0. So the LSB is 0 (the last character in the string). So the reversed bits are 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1.

So processing in reversed order, the first bit is 0 (even), so step +=1, remove it.

Then the next bits are 1,1,1,0,1 (remaining bits).

The next bit is 1 (so the number is odd). So we need to add 1. The number of trailing 1s here is 3 (since the next bits are 1,1,1). Adding 1 will flip them all to 0, and increment the next bit (which is 0) to 1. So steps += 1 (add) and steps += 3 (divisions). So steps increases by 4.

Then, the new number becomes 0,0,0,1 → which is 1000 (8 in decimal). Then, dividing by 2 three times (steps +=3) → leading to 1.

Wait, but how does this fit into the overall steps?

Alternatively, when there is a block of k consecutive 1s followed by a 0, then adding 1 to this block would generate a carry, turning the k 1s into 0s and the 0 into 1. The number of steps for this block is k + 1 (the add and k divisions). But after that, the 0 is turned into 1, which may be part of a new block of 1s if there are more consecutive 1s to the left.

Wait, perhaps the process can be modeled by grouping the binary digits into runs of 1s and 0s.

Let's think in terms of processing the binary digits from right to left (LSB to MSB).

We can represent the binary digits as a list in reversed order (so that the first element is the LSB).

We'll process each group of consecutive 1s and 0s.

Let's see:

Example 3: reversed bits are [0,1,1,1,0,1].

Processing from left to right (LSB to MSB in original string):

- The first element is 0 (even), so divide by 2 (step 1). Now the bits are [1,1,1,0,1].

- Next, the bits start with 1. This is a group of three 1s. We need to add 1, which will flip them to 0s and carry over. Then, the next bit is 0, which becomes 1. So after adding 1, the new bits are [0,0,0,1,1]. The steps here are adding 1 (step 2) and three divisions (steps 3,4,5). Then, the next bit is 1 (from the carry). But after the three divisions, the number is now [1,1], which is 3 (11 in binary). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, when you have a group of k consecutive 1s followed by a 0, then:

- Adding 1 to the group turns all k 1s into 0s and the 0 into 1.

- The steps needed for this group are (k + 1). Because adding 1 (1 step) and then k divisions (each step). But after that, the next bit is 1 (from the carry), so this new 1 may form a new group.

But after adding 1, the number is even (since it ends with 0), but after the divisions, the number becomes the remaining bits.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the binary number as a reversed list and process each bit.

Another example: binary '1011' (11 in decimal). Reversed list is [1,1,0,1].

Steps:

1. The number is 11 (odd). Add 1 (step 1). Now the number is 12 (1100 in binary). Reversed list is [0,0,1,1]. Now, divide by 2 once (step 2) → 6 (110). Reversed list is [0,1,1]. Divide again (step3) →3 (11), which is odd. Add 1 (step4) →4 (100). Divide by 2 twice (steps 5 and 6) →1. Total steps 6.

But according to the initial example, this would take 4 steps (steps 1 +3). So perhaps the approach of grouping consecutive 1s and 0s and calculating steps based on the group isn't straightforward.

Alternative idea: we can represent the binary number as a list of bits (reversed) and track the current position. We can process each bit, keeping track of whether we are in a carry state (like when adding 1).

Wait, here's a possible approach:

Initialize the steps counter to 0.

We process the bits in reversed order (LSB first), and for each bit, decide whether we need to add 1 or just divide.

But since the steps are deterministic, perhaps we can model the process as follows:

We start from the LSB (the first bit in the reversed list). We process each bit:

- While there are bits left:

   - If the current bit is 0 (even), divide by 2: step +=1, move to next bit (i.e., remove the current bit).

   - Else (current bit is 1, odd):

      - We need to add 1. This will cause a carry. The steps for adding 1 and handling the carry can be calculated as follows:

         - Find the number of consecutive 1s starting from the current position. Let's say there are k consecutive 1s. Adding 1 will flip all these 1s to 0s, and set the next bit (k+1-th position) to 1.

         - The steps required for this operation are k + 1 (1 for adding 1, and k for dividing by 2 k times).

         - However, after these steps, the next bit (k+1-th position) may be 1, which may need to be processed again (if it's part of a longer group of 1s).

So, for example:

If the current position is i, and the next k bits are 1s, then:

steps += k + 1.

Then, the next position to process is i + k. But after adding 1 and dividing k times, the (i +k)th bit (originally a 0) is now a 1. So we need to increment that bit by 1 (but it was set to 1 in the addition step). So the (i +k)th bit is now 1.

But how does this affect the rest of the processing? For example, if the (i +k)th bit was originally 0, after adding 1 and carrying, it's now 1. So when we process this bit, it's part of a new group of 1s. So we need to check if there are consecutive 1s following this bit.

But this seems to require a way to track whether the current bit was modified due to a previous carry.

Alternatively, this suggests that when we have a group of k consecutive 1s followed by a 0, adding 1 to them will turn them into 0s and the 0 into 1. The steps are k + 1. Then, the next bit is 1, which may now form part of another group. So we can model this as follows:

- When processing a group of k consecutive 1s followed by a 0, the steps are k + 1. Then, the 0 becomes 1, which may form a new group with any subsequent 1s.

So, for example, in the reversed list:

bits = [1,1,1,0,1]

Processing:

The first three bits are 1,1,1 (k=3), followed by a 0. So steps += 3 +1 =4. The 0 becomes 1. Now, the next bits are 1 and then the existing 1 (original bit 4, which is 1 in this example). So after processing, the new bits become [0,0,0,1,1]. Then, the next group is the new 1 (originally bit 4) followed by any 1s after it. But in this case, the next bit (bit 4) is 1. So we have a new group of 1s followed by a 0 (bit 5 is 1). Wait, but the original bit 5 was 1. Hmm.

This seems complicated, but perhaps the key is that whenever we have a group of k 1s followed by a 0, we can process them as a group, adding k+1 steps, and then the next bit becomes 1. This next bit may be part of another group, which could also be processed similarly.

Another example:

Original binary: 1011 (11) → reversed bits: [1,1,0,1].

Processing:

The first group is two 1s (since the third bit is 0). Wait, the reversed bits are 1,1,0,1. The first three bits are 1,1,0. So the group of consecutive 1s is the first two bits (1,1), followed by a 0. So k=2. Steps += 2+1=3. Now, the 0 becomes 1, so the new bits are [0,0,1,1]. But now, the next bits to process are the third bit (1) and fourth bit (1). So we have a new group of 1s (two 1s) followed by nothing (end of the list). But since there is no 0 after them, how do we process that?

Ah, right. If there is no 0 after a group of 1s (i.e., the group is at the end of the list), then adding 1 to them would create a new 1 at the next position. For example, if the bits are [1,1,1], adding 1 would turn them into [0,0,0,1]. So this new 1 is added beyond the current bits. So in this case, after processing a group of k 1s with no trailing 0 (i.e., they are the last bits), the steps are k + 1 (add 1 and divide k times). Then, the new bit added is 1, which is now the only remaining bit (since dividing k times removes all k zeros and the new 1 is the next bit). So, for example, if the original bits are [1,1,1], processing them would require steps +=3 +1 (4 steps). After that, the new bit is 1 (from the carry), which is now the only bit. Then, since this is 1 (and equals 1), we are done.

Putting this all together, the algorithm can be structured as follows:

- Convert the input binary string into a list of bits in reversed order (LSB first).

- Initialize steps to 0.

- Process the bits from left to right (LSB to MSB in the original string).

- While there are bits remaining:

   - If the current bit is 0:

      - Divide by 2 (remove the bit), steps +=1.

   - Else:

      - Find the length of consecutive 1s starting at the current position (k).

      - If k is followed by a 0 (i.e., there is a bit after the k 1s that is 0):

         - steps += k +1.

         - Remove the k 1s and the following 0.

         - Insert a 1 at the next position (the position after the 0). This is equivalent to flipping the k 1s to 0s, flipping the 0 to 1, and then dividing k times (removing the k zeros).

      - Else (the k 1s are the last bits):

         - steps += k +1.

         - Remove the k 1s.

         - Append a 1. This represents adding 1 to the number, which becomes 2^k, then dividing k times.

   - Repeat until the list is empty or contains only a single 1.

But how do we represent the inserting and appending of bits efficiently, especially for a list of 1e6 elements?

Manipulating a list for 1e6 elements with insertions and deletions would be O(n) time per operation, which is not feasible. So we need a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: instead of modifying the list, track the current position and the state of the carry.

We can track the current position in the reversed list and a carry flag.

Let's model the process as follows:

- Traverse the bits in reversed order (LSB first), processing each bit.

- We also need to track whether there's a carry that needs to be processed.

But this might not capture all cases.

Alternative idea: represent the binary number as a list in reversed order, and process it in segments, counting the steps without modifying the list.

But how?

Another idea is to track the number of consecutive 1s encountered and the position where a 0 is found. For example:

When we encounter a run of k 1s followed by a 0, we can calculate the steps for this run as k + 1, and then the next bit (after the 0) is set to 1. So, this effectively merges the next bit into the next possible run of 1s.

But since we cannot modify the list, perhaps we can track the number of steps and the current position.

Let's try to model this:

Initialize steps = 0.

current_pos = 0.

reversed_bits = list of bits in reversed order.

length = len(reversed_bits).

while current_pos < length:

   if reversed_bits[current_pos] == 0:

      steps +=1

      current_pos +=1

   else:

      # count consecutive 1s

      k = 0

      while current_pos + k < length and reversed_bits[current_pos +k] ==1:

          k +=1

      # after this, we have k consecutive 1s.

      # check if there is a 0 after them.

      if current_pos +k < length:

          # the next bit is 0.

          steps += k +1

          # after processing, the k 1s are turned into 0s, the 0 into 1.

          # so we can treat the next bit as 1, and current_pos becomes current_pos +k +1 (since the k+1 bits are processed)

          current_pos +=k +1

          # but we need to increment the bit at current_pos +k, which is 0, to 1. However, since we are not modifying the list, perhaps this can be modeled by incrementing steps and the current_pos.

          # Wait, no. Because after flipping the 0 to 1, the next bits may form a new group of 1s. But since we are not modifying the list, this approach might not work.

          # Alternatively, the next bit (which was 0) is now treated as a 1. So after processing the k 1s and the 0, we can set current_pos to current_pos +k +1 - but then the next bit (which was the 0) is now a 1, which may form a new group.

          # Wait, perhaps this approach is not feasible.

          # For example:

          # reversed_bits = [1,1,1,0,1,0]

          # current_pos starts at 0.

          # k=3 (bits 0,1,2 are 1s). next bit (3) is 0.

          # steps +=3+1=4.

          # current_pos becomes 0+3+1=4.

          # The next bit is 4, which is 0.

          # So steps +=1 (divide by 2).

          # But the actual scenario after processing would have that bit 3 (originally 0) is now 1, so the next bits would be 1,0.

          # So this approach would not capture that.

So this approach won't work because the next bit (after the group of 1s and 0) is now a 1, but the original list still has a 0 there. Therefore, the model is incorrect.

This suggests that the only way to accurately track the steps is to process the binary digits in reversed order and manage the current state of the bits, including any carries that occur when adding 1.

But for large binary strings, we need an O(n) algorithm.

An alternative approach inspired by the problem's solution in code:

Let's consider the binary number as a reversed list and track the current position and the number of trailing ones.

We can keep track of the number of trailing ones (trail) as we process each bit.

When we encounter a 0:

- If trail is zero, then this is a normal even step: increment steps by 1, move to next bit.

- If trail is greater than zero:

   - This means that there were trailing ones previously, and adding 1 will convert them to zeros. But since we have encountered a 0, adding 1 will create a carry here.

   - So, steps += (trail + 1). Because adding 1 (1 step) and then trail steps (dividing by 2 trail times).

   - Then, trail is reset to 1 (since the current 0 becomes 1 after carry).

But wait, maybe not. Let's think:

For example, consider the bits in reversed order: 0 (current), and previous bits have trail=3.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Another idea comes from observing that when you have a run of m trailing ones, adding 1 will take m steps (steps += m+1) and generate a carry that converts the next 0 to 1. So the total steps for processing this run is m+1 steps. Then, the next 0 becomes 1, which may form part of a new run of trailing ones. So, the algorithm can be:

Initialize steps = 0, trail = 0.

Process each bit in reversed order (LSB first):

   if bit is 1:

      trail +=1

   else:

      if trail ==0:

          steps +=1  # divide by 2

      else:

          steps += (trail + 1)  # add 1 (1 step) and trail divisions

          # The carry converts this 0 to 1, which is part of a new trail

          trail =1  # because the 0 is now 1, which is part of a new trail

      # process the next bit

After processing all bits:

   if trail >0:

       steps += (trail +1)  # add 1 and trail divisions (but here, after adding 1, the number becomes 1 followed by trail zeros, which requires trail+1 steps)

Wait, let's test this with the third example.

Example 3: input is 101110 (binary 46). Reversed bits are [0,1,1,1,0,1].

Processing each bit:

trail starts at 0, steps at 0.

- bit 0 (LSB) is 0:

   trail is 0 → steps +=1 (steps=1). trail remains 0.

- next bit (1):

   trail becomes 1.

- next bit (1):

   trail becomes 2.

- next bit (1):

   trail becomes 3.

- next bit (0):

   trail is 3. So steps +=3+1=4 (steps=5). trail is set to 1.

- next bit (1):

   trail becomes 2.

After all bits processed:

trail is 2. So steps +=2+1=3 → steps=8.

Which matches the example's output of 8.

Another example: input '1' → reversed is [1]. trail is 1. After processing all bits, steps +=1+1=2? But the correct answer is 0. Oh wait, no. Wait, the input is 1. We need to do zero steps. So the algorithm has a problem here.

Wait, the algorithm after processing all bits, if trail>0:

steps += trail+1.

But in this case, trail=1. steps becomes 1+1=2, but the correct answer is 0. So what's wrong?

Ah, because when the number is already 1 (trail=1, all bits processed), but according to the algorithm, steps +=1+1=2 steps, which is wrong. So the algorithm must have a condition to handle the case when the entire number is 1.

So, we need to subtract 2 in this case, perhaps. Because when trail is 1, after processing all bits, steps +=1+1=2 steps, but in reality, no steps are needed. So the algorithm overcounts for the case where the number is 1.

So the problem is in the final step. The code should not add (trail +1) steps if trail ==1 after processing all bits. Because in that case, the number is 1, and we should stop.

So the correct algorithm is:

Process each bit as before, and after processing all bits:

if trail >0:

   steps += (trail +1) if trail >1 else 1.

Wait, let's see:

For trail=1, after processing all bits, the number is 1. So steps should be added 0. But according to the code:

steps += trail+1 → steps +=2. But this is incorrect. So the algorithm must check if trail is 1 and all bits have been processed (i.e., the number is 1).

So the correct approach is:

After processing all bits:

if trail >0:

   steps += trail +1 (but subtract 2 if trail ==1 and there are no more bits).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think:

When trail >0 after processing all bits, it means that the number is of the form 111...1 (trail ones). So adding 1 turns it into 1000...0 (trail+1 zeros), which requires trail+1 steps (1 add and trail divisions). However, after these steps, the number is 1 followed by trail zeros. Dividing by 2 trail times brings it to 1.

But for trail=1:

Original number is 1. Adding 1 makes it 10 (2), then divide by 2 (steps 2). But wait, the correct answer is 0 steps. So the algorithm is incorrect here.

So the final step should be:

if trail >0:

   steps += (trail +1) → but subtract 2 if the number is exactly 1.

But how to detect that the number is exactly 1?

The number is exactly 1 when there's only one bit and it's 1.

But according to the algorithm's processing:

When the input is '1', the reversed bits are [1]. Processing:

trail starts at 0.

- bit is 1: trail becomes 1.

All bits processed. trail >0.

steps += (1+1) = 2. But correct answer is 0.

So to fix this, after processing all bits, if trail >0, we need to check if the original number is 1.

Alternatively, during the processing, if all bits are processed and trail is 1, then subtract 2 steps.

But how to track that.

Alternatively, when trail is 1 and there are no more bits (i.e., the number is 1), then the steps added should be 0.

But according to the algorithm's current logic, steps += trail+1 =2.

So perhaps the correct way is:

steps += max(0, (trail +1) - (2 if trail ==1 else 0)).

But how to model this.

Alternative approach:

After processing all bits:

if trail >0:

   if trail ==1:

       steps += 0  # because the number is already 1.

   else:

       steps += trail +1

Wait, but when trail is 1 and the number is 1, steps should not be added. But what about other cases where trail is 1 and there are other bits?

Wait, no. The trail is the number of trailing 1s in the current processing. When all bits are processed and trail>0, it means that the entire number is made up of trail 1s.

For example:

If the number is 3 (11), then trail is 2. After processing all bits, steps +=3 (2+1) → steps=3. Which is correct.

If the number is 1 (1), then trail is 1. steps +=0 → steps=0.

If the number is 7 (111), then trail is 3. steps +=4 → steps=4. Which is correct.

So the fix is:

After processing all bits, if trail >0:

   if trail ==1:

       steps +=0

   else:

       steps += trail +1.

But how to know if trail is 1 and the original number is 1.

But when trail is 1 after processing all bits, the original number must have been 1. Because trail is the number of trailing 1s in the reversed list, and processing all bits means that all the bits were 1s.

Wait, no. For example, if the original number is 3 (11), then reversed bits are [1,1]. Processing:

trail starts at 0.

First bit is 1 → trail=1.

Second bit is 1 → trail=2.

After processing all bits, trail=2. So steps +=2+1=3.

But for trail=1, the only case is when there's a single 1 in the reversed list. So trail=1 after processing all bits implies that the original number is 1.

Thus, the code can be modified to:

after processing all bits:

if trail >0:

   if trail ==1:

       steps +=0

   else:

       steps += trail +1

So in the case of input '1', the steps are 0.

Testing this:

Example 1: input '1'. reversed bits [1].

Processing:

trail starts at 0.

bit 0: 1 → trail=1.

All bits processed. trail=1. So steps +=0. Total steps 0 → correct.

Another example: input '11' (3). reversed bits [1,1].

Processing:

trail starts at 0.

bit0: 1 → trail=1.

bit1:1 → trail=2.

All bits processed. trail=2>1 → steps +=2+1=3. Total steps 3 → correct.

Another example: input '1011' (11). reversed bits [1,1,0,1].

Processing:

trail starts at 0.

bit0:1 → trail=1.

bit1:1 → trail=2.

bit2:0 → trail is 2>0. steps +=2+1=3. trail=1.

bit3:1 → trail=2.

After processing all bits, trail=2. steps +=2+1=3. total steps 3+3=6.

But the correct steps for 11 is 6:

11 (step 1: add 1 → 12, step 2: divide →6, step3: divide →3, step4: add1 →4, steps5,6: divide twice. Total 6 steps. So this is correct.

So the algorithm now works for the example cases.

So the steps are:

- Initialize steps=0, trail=0.

- For each bit in reversed order:

   if bit is 1:

      trail +=1

   else:

      if trail ==0:

          steps +=1

      else:

          steps += trail +1

          trail =1  # because the 0 is turned into 1 by the carry.

- After processing all bits:

   if trail>0:

      if trail ==1:

          steps +=0

      else:

          steps += trail +1

So this seems to handle the cases correctly.

Now, the next challenge is to implement this efficiently in Python, given that the input binary string can be up to 1e6 characters long.

The steps are:

1. Read the input binary string.

2. Reverse it to process from LSB to MSB.

3. Iterate over each character in the reversed string.

4. Keep track of 'trail' and 'steps' as per the algorithm.

Then, after processing all characters, handle the trail.

So in Python, the code would look like this:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    x = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    reversed_x = x[::-1]

    steps =0

    trail =0

    for bit in reversed_x:

        if bit == '1':

            trail +=1

        else:

            if trail ==0:

                steps +=1

            else:

                steps += trail +1

                trail =1

    # after loop

    if trail >0:

        if trail ==1:

            steps +=0

        else:

            steps += trail +1

    print(steps, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()

Example 3: input '101110' → reversed is '011101'.

Processing:

reversed_x is '0','1','1','1','0','1'.

Loop:

bit 0: '0' → trail is 0 → steps +=1 (steps=1).

bit 1: '1' → trail=1.

bit 2: '1' → trail=2.

bit 3: '1' → trail=3.

bit 4: '0' → trail=3>0 → steps +=3+1=4 (steps=1+4=5). trail=1.

bit 5: '1' → trail=2.

After loop, trail=2>0. So steps +=2+1=3 → total steps 5+3=8. Correct.

Another example: input '1011' (11) → reversed is '1101'.

Loop:

bit0: '1' → trail=1.

bit1: '1' → trail=2.

bit2: '0' → trail=2>0 → steps +=2+1=3. trail=1.

bit3: '1' → trail=2.

After loop, trail=2>0. steps +=3 → steps=3+3=6. Correct.

Another example: input '101110' (46) → steps 8. Correct.

Another example: input '101110' → output 8. Correct.

So this code seems to handle all cases correctly.

But what about the case where after adding 1, the carry propagates past the current bits? For example, binary '111' (7) → reversed '111'.

Processing:

trail starts at 0.

bit0: '1' → trail=1.

bit1: '1' → trail=2.

bit2: '1' → trail=3.

After loop, trail=3>0. Since trail>1, steps +=3+1=4. Total steps 4.

Which is correct. Steps for 7:

7 → add1 (step1) → 8 → divide three times (steps 2,3,4). Total 4 steps.

Yes.

Another example: input '101' (5). Steps:

5 is 101 → reversed is '101'.

Processing:

bit0: '1' → trail=1.

bit1: '0' → trail>0 → steps +=1+1=2 (steps=2). trail=1.

bit2: '1' → trail=2.

After loop, trail=2>0 → steps +=2+1=3. Total steps 2+3=5.

Let's simulate:

5 → add1 (step1) →6 → divide (step2) →3 (step3) → add1 (step4) →4 → divide twice (steps5,6). Wait, but according to the code, steps are 5.

Wait, what is the correct steps for 5:

5 is 101.

Steps:

1. Add 1 →6 (step1).

2. Divide →3 (step2).

3. Add 1 →4 (step3).

4. Divide →2 (step4).

5. Divide →1 (step5).

Total 5 steps. So code's output is 5, which is correct.

Yes, the code is correct.

So this code should work correctly for all cases, and it's O(n) time, which is acceptable for 1e6 digits.

Regarding the memory usage: the reversed string is stored as a string, which is O(n) space. But for 1e6 characters, this is manageable.

So the final code is as follows.
</think>

```python
x = input().strip()
reversed_x = x[::-1]
steps = 0
trail = 0

for bit in reversed_x:
    if bit == '1':
        trail += 1
    else:
        if trail == 0:
            steps += 1
        else:
            steps += trail + 1
            trail = 1

if trail > 0:
    if trail == 1:
        steps += 0
    else:
        steps += trail + 1

print(steps)
```
