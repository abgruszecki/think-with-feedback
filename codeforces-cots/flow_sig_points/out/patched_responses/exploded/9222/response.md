Okay, let's see. The problem is about processing a series of delete operations on a username that's formed by repeating a string s k times. Then, for each operation, we need to delete the p-th occurrence of a character c. The challenge is to do this efficiently given the constraints.

First, let's understand the input. The initial string is s multiplied by k. For example, if s is "bac" and k is 2, the initial string is "bacbac". Then, each operation is like "p c" where we delete the p-th occurrence of c in the current string. After all operations, output the resulting string.

The main issue here is handling the deletions efficiently, especially when the initial string could be up to 2000 * 100 = 200,000 characters long, and there are up to 20,000 operations. Each deletion could require finding the p-th occurrence of c, which if done naively (like scanning the string each time) would be O(n * m) time, which might be too slow for the largest cases.

Hmm. So, how to model the deletions efficiently?

Wait, each deletion is of the p-th occurrence of c. The problem says that the operations are correct, so we don't need to handle errors. Also, after each deletion, the string changes, so subsequent operations are based on the modified string.

The key here is to track the positions of each character in the string and efficiently find the p-th occurrence of c, then delete it, updating the structure for future operations.

But maintaining the actual string and modifying it for each operation could be expensive because deletions in the middle of a string (like a list in Python) would take O(n) time each, which for 20,000 operations would be O(20,000 * 200,000) = 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Instead of maintaining the actual string, track the positions that are deleted. Then, after all operations, reconstruct the string by including the characters that weren't deleted. But how to track the order of deletions?

Wait, but each deletion affects the positions of the remaining characters. For example, if the first occurrence of 'a' is at position 5 and you delete it, then the next occurrence that was originally at position 6 becomes position 5, and so on. So the order in which deletions happen affects the indices.

So the problem is that each deletion changes the indices of the remaining characters. So when we process each deletion, we need to account for the fact that prior deletions have altered the positions.

Hmm. So the challenge is to track, for each operation, the p-th occurrence of c in the current string. How can we model this efficiently?

One possible approach is to model the string as a linked list, where each node points to the next and previous character. This way, deletions can be done in O(1) time once the node is found. However, finding the p-th occurrence of c would take O(n) time each time, which again could be too slow for 20,000 operations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute all the positions of each character, and then track which ones are deleted. For example, for each character c, we can have a list of all its positions in the original string. Then, when a deletion is made (like delete the p-th occurrence of c), we can find which original position that was and mark it as deleted. But how does the order of deletions affect the p-th occurrence?

Wait, because when you delete a character, all subsequent characters shift left by one. So, the original positions are fixed, but the effective positions in the current string depend on how many deletions occurred before them.

For example, suppose in the original string, the occurrences of 'a' are at positions 0, 3, 5. If the first deletion is the first occurrence of 'a' (original position 0), then the next occurrence in the current string would be original positions 3 and 5, but their effective positions would be 3-1=2 and 5-2=3 (if another deletion occurs before them).

This complicates things. So the problem is that each deletion affects the count of previous deletions before a certain position. To find the p-th occurrence in the current string, we need to know how many deletions have occurred before each original occurrence of c.

Wait, maybe we can model each occurrence of a character as a list, and track for each occurrence whether it's been deleted. Then, for a given operation, to find the p-th active occurrence of c, we can traverse the list until we find the p-th active one. However, this could be O(n) per operation, which is not acceptable for 20k operations and 200k original characters.

Alternatively, maybe using a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a Segment Tree to track the number of active characters up to a certain point.

Let me think. Let's say that all the original characters are in order. Each character's original position is known. When a deletion happens, the actual position in the current string depends on the number of deletions that occurred before that character. So, for the original position i, the current position is i minus the number of deletions that happened before i.

But for the p-th occurrence of c in the current string, we need to find the original occurrence of c such that when considering all deletions before it, it's the p-th occurrence in the current list.

Hmm. So for example, suppose for character c, the original positions are at indices [i1, i2, i3, ... im]. Then, when processing a delete operation for p, we need to find the original position ip such that, when considering all deletions that happened before ip (excluding this one), the count of active c's up to ip is exactly p. Once found, we mark it as deleted.

But how to efficiently find that ip?

Each time we process a delete operation, we can for each occurrence of c, track how many of them are deleted before the current one. Then, to find the p-th active occurrence, we can binary search through the original list of positions for c, but subtract the number of deletions that have been made before each position.

Wait, perhaps for each character c, we can pre-sort the list of original positions where it occurs. Then, for a delete operation (p, c), we need to find the original position that is the p-th occurrence in the current list of c's. Since each prior deletion of c would affect the current count.

For example, suppose c's original positions are [i0, i1, i2, ... im], sorted in increasing order. Each time we delete a c, we mark one of these positions as deleted. So, for a new delete operation (p, c), we need to find the original position that is the p-th active in the list of c's.

But how? Because deletions can be in any order. So for example, if some of the earlier positions were already deleted, the p-th active could be a later original position.

This sounds like a problem where we need to track for each c, the active positions, and for a given p, find the original position which is the p-th in the active list.

But maintaining a list and deleting elements from it could be manageable if the list is kept sorted, and we can perform binary search to find the p-th element. However, for each c, maintaining a list of active positions, and when a deletion happens, removing it from the list.

But for that, perhaps using a binary indexed tree (Fenwick Tree) or a segment tree to track which positions are active. For example, for each c, the original positions are stored in a list. Then, for each position in this list, we can track if it's active. When we need to find the p-th active position, we can perform a binary search on the original positions and use a BIT to query the number of active elements up to a certain index. Then, adjust based on the count.

Alternatively, for each c, we can have a list of all original positions (sorted in the order they appear in the original string). Then, for each c, we can track which indices in this list are deleted. For example, for c's list [i0, i1, i2, ... im], each deletion would mark one of these as deleted. To find the p-th active in the current list, we need to find the element in the list where the number of active elements before it (including itself) equals p.

This is similar to a problem where you have a dynamic set of elements and need to find the k-th element. A data structure that allows for this efficiently is a Binary Indexed Tree that keeps track of the presence of elements and can compute the prefix sum up to a certain index.

Wait, here's an idea. For each character c, we can precompute all the positions where c occurs in the original string. For example, for the original string (s multiplied k times), we can collect all the positions (0-based indices) of each character c. These positions are stored in a list for each c, sorted in increasing order.

For each operation (p, c), we need to find the p-th occurrence of c in the current string. Since the original list is sorted, but some positions may have been deleted, the p-th occurrence in the current list is the position in the original list that has exactly p-1 active elements before it (since each deletion reduces the count).

But how do we track which positions are deleted? For each c, we can have a Fenwick Tree that tracks for each position in the original list whether it's active. Then, when we need to find the p-th active occurrence, we can perform a binary search on the original list's indices, using the Fenwick Tree to compute the number of active elements up to a certain position.

Wait, here's a detailed plan:

1. Preprocess the original string (s repeated k times) and collect all the positions for each character. For example, for each character c in the original string, collect the list positions[c], which is a list of indices (0-based) where c occurs, in order.

2. For each character c, create a Fenwick Tree (or similar structure) that tracks whether each position in positions[c] is active. Initially, all are active. The Fenwick Tree will allow us to compute the sum (number of active elements) up to a certain index in the positions[c] list.

3. For each delete operation (p, c):
   a. We need to find the index in positions[c] such that, in the current active list, it's the p-th occurrence. Since positions[c] is ordered, this can be found using a binary search on the indices of positions[c], using the Fenwick Tree to compute the prefix sum.
   b. Once the index in positions[c] is found (say, index i in the list positions[c], which corresponds to the original string position positions[c][i]), mark it as deleted in the Fenwick Tree (by subtracting 1 from that position's count).
   
4. After all operations, reconstruct the resulting string by including all original positions that are not marked as deleted in their respective Fenwick Trees. Then, output the characters in the order of their original positions, excluding those that were deleted.

But how do we handle overlapping deletions? Because when a character is deleted, it affects the positions of the remaining characters. Wait, no. Because in this approach, the original positions are fixed, and the deletion is tracked via the Fenwick Tree. However, when reconstructing the final string, we collect all original positions that are still active, sort them, and output the characters in the order of their original positions. Wait, because the original positions are in the order of the original string. So, if we collect all the original positions that were not deleted, and then sort them, that will give the correct order of the remaining characters.

For example, the original string is "bacbac" (positions 0-5). Suppose positions 1 (the 'a') and 0 (the 'b') are deleted. The remaining positions are 2,3,4,5. When sorted, they are 2,3,4,5, which correspond to 'c', 'b', 'a', 'c' — which is the correct order.

So the key is that, after all deletions, collect all the original positions that are still active (i.e., not deleted) and then output the characters in the order of their original positions.

But how do we track which original positions are deleted?

Wait, for each character c, the positions in the original string are stored in positions[c]. For each such position, when it is deleted, the Fenwick Tree for c's list will track that it's deleted. However, how do we track deletions for other characters? Because when a deletion occurs for a different character, it affects the positions of other characters, but the original positions are stored in their own lists.

Wait, no. Because in the original string, all positions are fixed. So the position in the original string is unique. When a character is deleted (from any list), it's marked as deleted in the global set of positions. But how?

Wait, perhaps the approach above is missing something. Because when you delete a character from the list of a certain c, you have to mark that original position as deleted. However, other characters in their own lists may also refer to that position. But that's impossible, because each position in the original string corresponds to exactly one character. So, for example, if position 5 in the original string is 'c', then it's in the list for 'c's. When it's deleted (as part of a 'c' deletion), the original position 5 is marked as deleted. So when reconstructing the final string, we can collect all positions that are not deleted, regardless of which character's list they came from.

Wait, no. Because each deletion is processed as part of a character's list. So when you process a delete operation (p, c), you find the p-th occurrence in the current list of c's, which is tracked via the Fenwick Tree for c's list. Once found, the original position is marked as deleted. But how do we track that the original position is deleted globally?

Ah, here's the problem. The Fenwick Trees are per character. So for example, suppose a position in the original string is a 'a' and another 'a' is deleted. But that position is in the 'a's list. However, if another deletion for a different character (say 'b') occurs, how is that tracked? The answer is that each position is only in one list (the list for its own character). So when a position is deleted (by any operation), it's marked in the list for its character. So when reconstructing the final string, we need to collect all positions from all characters' lists that are still active (i.e., not deleted).

Wait, no. Because each position is only in one character's list. So for each position, if it's in the list for 'c', then when it's deleted (via a 'c' operation), it's marked as deleted in the 'c's Fenwick Tree. So when reconstructing, for each character's list, we check which positions are active (using their Fenwick Tree) and collect those positions. Then, all collected positions are merged and sorted to form the final string.

But how to collect all active positions across all characters?

This might not be feasible. Because for each character c, we can iterate through their positions list and for each position in that list, check if it's active (via the Fenwick Tree for c's list). Then, collect all active positions from all characters and sort them, then output the characters in the order of their original positions.

But the problem is that the original string's characters are in the order of their positions, so after collecting all active positions (from all characters), we can sort them in increasing order and output the corresponding characters from the original string.

Yes. So here's the plan:

1. Generate the original string by repeating s k times. Let's call this t.

2. For each character c in t, collect the list of positions (indices in t) where c occurs. For example, positions[c] is a list of i where t[i] == c.

3. For each character c, create a Fenwick Tree (BIT) that tracks the active positions in positions[c]. The BIT will have size equal to the length of positions[c]. Each position in the BIT corresponds to an index in positions[c]. Initially, all positions are active (so the BIT is initialized with 1s).

4. For each delete operation (p, c):

   a. In the list positions[c], find the index i such that the sum of active elements up to i (in the BIT for c) is equal to p. This can be done via binary search on the list positions[c].

   b. Once i is found, mark that position in the BIT for c as inactive (subtract 1 from the BIT at index i+1, since BITs are 1-based).

5. After processing all operations, collect all active positions. To do this:

   a. For each character c in positions:

      i. Iterate through each index in positions[c].

      ii. For each index i in positions[c], query the BIT for c to see if the sum up to i (in the BIT's terms) is 1 (active) minus the sum up to i-1. Wait, maybe another way: the sum from 1 to i (BIT's 1-based) gives the number of active elements up to the i-th position in the list. But we need to check if the element at position i in the list is active. Alternatively, each element in the BIT represents the count, so to check if a particular element is active, we can compute the prefix sum up to i and subtract prefix sum up to i-1. If the result is 1, then it's active.

   But this might be time-consuming for large lists. For example, if a character c has 1e5 positions, iterating through all of them would take O(1e5) time. For 26 characters, this could be 2.6e6 operations, which is manageable, but perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, for each character c's list positions[c], iterate through each index j (0-based in the list), and query whether the j-th element is active. To check this, the BIT for c can give the sum from 0 to j (0-based?), but the BIT is 1-based. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, for each character c:

- The list positions[c] is in the order of the original string. For each element in positions[c], we can track whether it's been deleted. But how? The BIT for c's list allows us to compute the number of active elements up to a certain index. But to check if a specific element is active, we can compute the prefix sum up to the current index minus the prefix sum up to the previous index. If it's 1, the element is active.

So for example, for the j-th element in positions[c], the index in the BIT is j+1 (since BIT is 1-based). The prefix sum up to j+1 minus the prefix sum up to j is the value at j+1, which tells us if the element is active (1) or not (0).

But in the BIT, each node represents a range, and to check a single position, we can query sum(j+1) - sum(j). If this is 1, then the element is active.

So for each character c, and each index j in positions[c], we can check if the element is active by querying the BIT's sum at j+1 and j. Then, if the difference is 1, the original position is active.

Once we have all active positions, we collect them, sort them, and then output the characters from the original string in those positions.

So steps 5 would be:

- Initialize a list 'active_positions' as empty.

- For each character c in positions:

   For j in 0 to len(positions[c])-1:

      Check if the j-th element in positions[c] is active by querying the BIT for c:

         sum = bit_c.query(j+1) - bit_c.query(j)

         if sum == 1:

             add positions[c][j] to active_positions.

- Sort active_positions in increasing order.

- Then, for each position in active_positions, append t[position] to the result.

But this approach is O(M), where M is the total number of characters in the original string. Since M can be up to 2000 * 100 = 200,000, and for each character in each list, we perform two BIT queries (O(log L), where L is the length of the list for c), this could be O(200,000 * log L) time, which is acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Another approach to collect active positions:

For each character c:

   The list positions[c] is ordered. For the BIT of c, we can iterate through each position in the list and check if it's active. Alternatively, can we find all active positions in the list efficiently using the BIT?

Wait, for each c, the positions are stored in a list, and the BIT tracks the active positions. The sum of the BIT is the number of active elements. So for each c, we can iterate from 0 to len(positions[c])-1 and check if the j-th element is active. This is O(L) per c, which for all c's sum up to O(M), which is acceptable.

So the key steps are:

- Precompute t = s * k.

- Precompute positions[c] for each c.

- For each c, create a BIT initialized with 1's (since all positions are active initially).

- Process each delete operation by finding the p-th active occurrence of c in positions[c], mark it as deleted in the BIT.

- Collect all active positions by checking each position in each c's list via the BIT.

- Sort the active positions and output the corresponding characters.

Now, the question is how to implement this in Python efficiently.

Implementing the BIT (Fenwick Tree) for each character's positions.

First, let's create the original string t. For s of length up to 100, multiplied by k up to 2000, t can be up to 200,000 characters.

Then, for each character in t, group their positions. For example, for 'a', collect all indices where 'a' occurs. This can be done in O(len(t)) time.

For each character c, the positions list is ordered, as we process t from left to right.

For the BIT, each c's BIT has size len(positions[c]). The BIT is 1-based, so for a list of length m, the BIT has m nodes.

Each node in the BIT represents the count of active elements in a certain range. For initialization, each position is active, so the BIT is initialized with 1's.

Now, for each delete operation (p, c):

We need to find the index j in positions[c] such that the number of active elements before or at j is exactly p. Since the elements are ordered in the same order as the original string, which is the same as their occurrence order, the p-th active occurrence in the current list is the j-th element in positions[c], considering deletions.

But how to find j? Since the BIT allows us to compute the prefix sum up to any index, we can perform a binary search over the possible j's in positions[c] to find the smallest j where the prefix sum is >= p. Once found, j is the index in positions[c], and the original position is positions[c][j].

Wait, for example, if the prefix sum up to j is p, then that j is the p-th occurrence. Because the prefix sum gives the number of active elements in the first j+1 elements (since BIT is 1-based). Wait, perhaps I need to think about the BIT's indices.

Let me rephrase: the positions[c] list is 0-based. The BIT for c is 1-based. For each index j in positions[c], the BIT's index is j+1. The sum from BIT up to j+1 gives the number of active elements in positions[c][0...j]. So for example, if j is 0 (the first element in positions[c]), the BIT's index is 1. The sum up to 1 gives the count of active elements in the first element.

So, for a delete operation (p, c), we need to find the smallest index j in positions[c] such that the sum up to j+1 in the BIT for c is equal to p. Because the sum up to j+1 is the number of active elements in the first j+1 elements (positions 0 to j). But since we are to delete the p-th occurrence in the current list, which is the j-th element in positions[c], that j must be such that the sum up to j+1 is p and the sum up to j is p-1. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The problem is to find the j-th element in positions[c] such that, in the current list of active elements for c, it is the p-th one. Since the list is ordered, the active elements are in the same order as their positions in the original string. So the p-th occurrence is the j-th element in positions[c] which is still active, and there are p-1 active elements before it in the list.

To find j, we can perform a binary search over the possible indices in the BIT. For example, the maximum possible j is len(positions[c]) - 1. The binary search would find the smallest j where the sum up to j+1 is >= p, and the sum up to j is < p. But I'm not sure. Let's think of the sum as the count of active elements up to j (inclusive) in the positions[c] list.

So the sum up to j+1 (BIT's index) is the number of active elements in positions[c][0..j]. So, for the p-th occurrence, we need to find the j where the sum up to j+1 is >= p, and the sum up to j is < p. Wait, but if the sum up to j is s, then adding positions[c][j] (if active) would make it s + 1. So for example, to find the p-th occurrence, we need to find the smallest j where the sum up to j+1 is exactly p.

Wait, maybe another approach. The sum from 1 to x in the BIT (1-based indices) represents the count of active elements in the first x elements of the BIT. Since each BIT element corresponds to a position in the positions[c] list (with BIT index x being the (x-1)th element in the list), the sum up to x gives the number of active elements in the first x elements of the list. So to find the p-th active element, we need to find the x where the sum up to x is p, and the sum up to x-1 is p-1.

This is the standard approach for finding the k-th active element using a BIT.

So, the binary search would start with low=1 and high=len(positions[c]). For each mid in this range, check if the sum up to mid is >= p. If yes, search left; else, search right. The correct x is the smallest x where the sum up to x is >= p.

Once x is found, the index in the positions[c] list is x-1 (since BIT is 1-based). Then, we need to update the BIT by subtracting 1 at position x (to mark it as deleted).

This process will correctly find the x-th element in the BIT (which is the (x-1)th element in the positions[c] list) which is the p-th active element.

So, the steps for processing a delete operation (p, c) are:

1. Check if the list positions[c] exists. If not, the operation is invalid (but per problem statement, operations are correct, so we can assume it exists).

2. Using binary search and the BIT for c, find the x in BIT indices where the sum up to x is p.

3. The index in the positions[c] list is x-1. The original position is positions[c][x-1].

4. Mark this position as deleted by updating the BIT for c at index x with a delta of -1.

So, the code for the Fenwick Tree (BIT) would need to support the following operations:

- Initialize a BIT of size m with all 1s.

- Query the prefix sum up to index x.

- Update the value at index x by adding delta.

Now, implementing the Fenwick Tree.

In Python, a Fenwick Tree can be implemented with a list. For a BIT initialized with size n, the tree has n+1 elements (since it's 1-based). The initial values are 1 for each position, so the BIT is initialized with 1s.

The Fenwick Tree's update function adds a delta to a position, and the query function returns the sum from 1 to x.

So, code for the Fenwick Tree:

class FenwickTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.n = size
        self.tree = [0] * (self.n + 1)
        for i in range(1, self.n+1):
            self.update(i, 1)  # Initialize all positions as 1

    def update(self, idx, delta):
        while idx <= self.n:
            self.tree[idx] += delta
            idx += idx & -idx

    def query(self, idx):
        res = 0
        while idx > 0:
            res += self.tree[idx]
            idx -= idx & -idx
        return res

But wait, in the problem's context, when we initialize the Fenwick Tree for a character's positions list of size m, the BIT has size m, and each position in the BIT corresponds to a position in the list. So for each of the m elements in the positions list, the BIT is initialized with 1's.

But the code above, when the FenwickTree is initialized with size m, and in the __init__ method, we call update(i, 1) for i from 1 to m. So each position starts with 1, which is correct.

Now, for each delete operation, when we find the x (BIT index), we call update(x, -1) to mark it as deleted (since the delta is -1, the value at x is now 0).

Now, the binary search part. For a given p and c, we need to find the x in the BIT such that the sum up to x is >= p, and the sum up to x-1 is < p. The standard approach for finding the k-th element using a Fenwick Tree.

Here's how to do the binary search:

left = 1
right = len(positions[c])
result = 0
while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    s = bit_c.query(mid)
    if s >= p:
        result = mid
        right = mid - 1
    else:
        left = mid + 1

After the loop, result is the x such that the sum up to x is >= p. If the sum is exactly p, then that's the position. We need to verify that sum up to x is exactly p. Since the operations are correct, this will always be the case.

So once x is found, we can call bit_c.update(x, -1) to mark it as deleted.

Once all operations are processed, we need to collect all active positions. For each character c:

positions_c = positions[c]
bit_c = fenwick_trees[c]
for j in range(len(positions_c)):
    # BIT is 1-based, so j+1 is the BIT index for the j-th element in positions_c
    if bit_c.query(j+1) - bit_c.query(j) == 1:
        active_positions.append(positions_c[j])

Then, sort active_positions and output the characters from the original string in that order.

This approach should work efficiently. The time complexity is:

- Preprocessing: O(M), where M is the length of t (k * len(s)).

- For each delete operation: O(log L), where L is the length of the list for character c. Since L can be up to M, and there are up to 20,000 operations, this is O(20000 * log M) which is acceptable.

- Collecting active positions: O(M * log L) for all characters. Since M is up to 200,000, and log L is up to 18, this is about 3.6e6 operations.

Overall, this should fit within the time constraints.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

2
bac
3
2 a
1 b
2 c

Original t is "bacbac" (positions 0-5: 'b','a','c','b','a','c').

positions for 'a' are [1,4], for 'b' [0,3], for 'c' [2,5].

Processing the first operation: 2 a.

We look into positions['a'] = [1,4]. The BIT for 'a' has size 2. Initially, both positions are active (sum up to 2 is 2).

We need to find the 2nd occurrence. So binary search:

left=1, right=2.

mid=1: sum is 1 (positions 0 in the list is 1). Not >=2.

mid=2: sum is 2. So result is 2. So x=2, j=1. The position is 4. Mark BIT 'a' at 2 by subtracting 1. Now, positions 1 is active, 4 is inactive.

Second operation: 1 b.

positions['b'] = [0,3]. BIT is initialized to [1,1]. The sum up to 1 is 1. So x=1. j=0. Position 0 is deleted. BIT 'b' now has sum up to 1 is 0, sum up to 2 is 1 (since after deleting 0, the active elements are [3]).

Third operation: 2 c.

positions['c'] = [2,5]. BIT is initialized to [1,1]. Now, after two active elements.

But the operation is to delete the 2nd occurrence. So sum up to x must be 2. So x=2. j=1. position 5 is deleted. BIT 'c' now has sum 1.

Now, collect active positions.

For 'a', positions 1 and 4. Check each:

j=0 (position 1):

query 1: sum 1 - sum 0 (which is 1 -0 =1). So active. Add 1.

j=1 (position4): sum 2 - sum 1 = 0. So not added.

For 'b' positions [0,3]:

j=0 (position0): sum 1 (BIT index 1) - sum 0 =0 (since it was deleted). So not added.

j=1 (position3): sum 2 (BIT index 2) - sum 1 (BIT index 1) is 1 (since after deleting j=0, sum up to 2 is 1). So add 3.

For 'c' positions [2,5]:

j=0 (position2): sum 1 (BIT index1) - sum0 (0) is 1. Add 2.

j=1 (position5): sum 2 (BIT index2) - sum1 (BIT index1) is 0. So not added.

So active positions are 1,3,2. When sorted: 1,2,3. So the characters are t[1] = 'a', t[2] = 'c', t[3] = 'b'. Which gives "acb", which matches the sample output.

Great. So the approach works.

Now, implement this in Python.

Potential optimizations:

- Precompute the original string t and positions for each character.

- Use a dictionary to map each character to its positions list and FenwickTree.

- For the FenwickTree, the code as discussed.

Now, code steps:

Read k.

Read s.

Read n.

Read the n operations.

Generate t = s * k.

positions = defaultdict(list)

for idx, char in enumerate(t):

   positions[char].append(idx)

For each character in positions, create a FenwickTree of size len(positions[char]).

process each operation (p, c):

   list_c = positions[c]

   if not list_c: continue (but per problem statement, operations are valid)

   ft = fenwick_trees[c]

   left = 1

   right = len(list_c)

   x = 0

   while left <= right:

       mid = (left + right) //2

       s = ft.query(mid)

       if s >= p:

           x = mid

           right = mid -1

       else:

           left = mid +1

   ft.update(x, -1)

After all operations:

active_positions = []

for c in positions:

   list_c = positions[c]

   ft = fenwick_trees[c]

   for j in range(len(list_c)):

       # j is 0-based in list_c. BIT index is j+1.

       # sum from j+1 is sum up to j+1, sum up to j is sum up to j.

       sum_j_plus1 = ft.query(j+1)

       sum_j = ft.query(j)

       if sum_j_plus1 - sum_j == 1:

           active_positions.append(list_c[j])

active_positions.sort()

result = ''.join(t[i] for i in active_positions)

print(result)

Now, implement this.

But how to manage the Fenwick Trees for each character? We can store them in a dictionary, say ft_dict, where keys are characters, and values are FenwickTree instances.

But in Python, the FenwickTree is initialized with the size of the list for the character. So:

Testing against sample input 1.

        self.n = size
        self.tree = [0]*(self.n +1)

        while idx >0:
            res += self.tree[idx]
            idx -= idx & -idx
        return res

    for p, c in ops:

        ft = ft_dict[c]

Another test case: sample 2.

Input:

1

abacaba

4

1 a

1 a

1 c

2 b

Original t is "abacaba".

positions for 'a' are [0,2,4,6], 'b' [1,5], 'c' [3].

Processing operations:

1 a: delete first a. positions are [0,2,4,6]. BIT 'a' is size 4. find x=1. update x=1 (mark 0 as deleted). Now, sum up to 1 is 0 (since after -1).

Second op: 1 a. Now, the active a's are [2,4,6]. So we need to delete first occurrence (sum up to x must be 1). x will be 2 (since positions 2 is index 1 in list, which after first deletion, BIT for 'a' is [0,1,1,1,1]. After x=1 (BIT index 1) is marked as -1, sum up to 1 is 0. sum up to 2 is 1. So binary search for p=1: x=2. So j=1 (original position 2). So mark x=2 as deleted. Now, active a's are 4 and 6.

Third op: 1 c. c's positions are [3]. delete the first occurrence, which is 3. So mark it as deleted.

Fourth op: 2 b. positions 'b' are [1,5]. The active list is both, since no deletions yet. So delete the second occurrence. x=2. j=1 (position5). mark it as deleted.

Collecting active positions:

For 'a', after deleting 0 and 2:

positions are 4 and 6. Check each:

j=0 (original index 0): already deleted.

j=1 (original index 2): deleted.

j=2 (original index4): sum for BIT index3 (j+1=3) is sum up to 3. Let's see: after two deletions, the BIT for 'a' was initialized with 4 elements, then:

After first deletion (x=1), the tree is updated to have sum 0 at x=1.

After second deletion (x=2), sum up to 2 is 1 (so 1 occurrence). Then, after deletion, sum up to 2 is 0.

But perhaps the code's active check for j=2 (list index 2) is:

sum_j_plus1 = ft.query(3) (since j=2, j+1=3). sum_j = ft.query(2).

What's the state of the BIT after two deletions?

Initially, the BIT for 'a' is 4 elements. After first deletion (x=1), the BIT is updated to subtract 1 at x=1. Then, for the second deletion (x=2), subtract 1 at x=2. So the sum for x=3 (j+1=3) would be the sum up to 3, which is the count after two deletions. Let's see:

After first deletion (x=1): sum up to 1 is 0.

After second deletion (x=2): sum up to 2 is 0 + 1 (from x=2's original 1, subtract 1) → 0.

Wait, the code may not be correct here. Let me re-express the steps.

Wait, the Fenwick Tree for 'a' is initialized with size 4. So for the first deletion (x=1), we call ft.update(1, -1). The sum up to 1 is 0. The sum up to 2 (positions[0,2] in the list) is 1 (since the second element is active). But after the second deletion (x=2), the code calls ft.update(2, -1). So the sum up to 2 is 0 (since 1 (initial) + (-1) = 0). The sum up to 3 is sum up to 3 (which includes the first two elements (now 0 and 0) and the third element (1) → sum 0 + 0 + 1 =1). So for j=2 (third element in the list, which is index 2 in the list, position4), j+1=3. query(3) is sum up to 3 → 1. query(2) is sum up to 2 → 0. So difference is 1 → active. So position4 is active. Similarly, for j=3 (position6), j+1=4. query(4) is sum up to 4: sum up to 3 is 1, and the fourth element (j=3) is active (assuming no deletions). So query(4) - query(3) = 1. So position6 is active.

So 'a' active positions are 4 and 6.

For 'b' positions [1,5]. After the fourth operation (deleting second occurrence, which was j=1 in the list, position5). So the BIT for 'b' is initialized with 2 elements. After deletion, x=2, so j=1 (position5) is marked as deleted. So in the active check:

j=0 (position1): sum_j_plus1 = query(1) = sum up to 1 → initially 1. After no deletions for 'b' except the fourth operation. Let's see:

The fourth operation is to delete the second 'b' occurrence. So x=2 (BIT index 2). The BIT for 'b' is of size 2. After update, the sum up to 2 is 1 (since one of the two was deleted). So for j=0 (position1):

sum_j_plus1 = query(1) → 1. sum_j = query(0) → 0. difference is 1 → active. So position1 is active. j=1 (position5): sum_j_plus1 = query(2) → 1. sum_j = query(1) → 1. difference 0 → not active.

For 'c' positions [3]. After third operation, x=1 (BIT index1) is marked as deleted. So query(1) - query(0) = 0 → not active.

So active positions are:

a:4,6

b:1

So active positions are 1,4,6. sorted → 1,4,6. characters are t[1] = 'b', t[4] = 'a', t[6] = 'a' → 'baa', which matches the sample.

So the code works for this case.

Thus, this code should handle the problem correctly.
