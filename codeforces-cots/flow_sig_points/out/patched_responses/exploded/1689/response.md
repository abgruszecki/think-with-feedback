<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the number of distinct sequences of k trips in a lift, where each trip follows the rule that the distance to the new floor y is strictly less than the distance from the current floor x to the forbidden floor b. And we need to compute this modulo 1e9+7.

Hmm. The key constraints here are for each step: after each trip, the next y must satisfy |x - y| < |x - b|. So for each current x, the next possible y's are all floors (excluding x) that are closer to x than x is to b. 

The approach here is dynamic programming, I think. Because for each step, the number of sequences depends on the previous floor. So, for step i, the state is the current floor, and the transitions are the valid y's from there.

Let's model this with DP. Let's define dp[i][x] as the number of sequences of i trips that end at floor x. Then, for each i from 1 to k, and each possible x, we can compute the transitions.

But wait, the problem allows k up to 5000 and n up to 5000. So a naive DP approach with O(k * n^2) time complexity would be 5000 * 5000 * 5000 = 125 billion operations. That's way too slow. So we need a way to optimize this.

So, what's the maximum possible n and k here? Both can be up to 5000. So O(k * n) is manageable (5000 * 5000 = 25 million), but O(k * n^2) is not. So we need to find a way to compute the transitions more efficiently.

The crux is to precompute, for each possible x, the list of possible y's and the number of options. Then, when transitioning from x to y, we can precompute for each x the sum over all possible y's that can be next steps. Wait, but each step requires that y is not x, and |x - y| < |x - b|.

Wait, the DP state for step i depends on the previous step's possible floors. For each x (current floor after i-1 steps), we need to compute how many ways there are to reach each possible y in the next step.

But for each x, the number of possible y's is the number of floors y != x where |y - x| < d, where d is |x - b|. So for each x, the possible y's form a range. For example, if x is fixed, the forbidden distance is d. Then y must be in (x - (d-1), x + (d-1)) but not equal to x. But also, y must be between 1 and n.

So for each x, the possible y's are in the interval [x - (d-1), x + (d-1)] \ {x}, but clamped to 1..n. So the total number of possible y's for x is (left_count + right_count - 1). Because d is |x - b|, so the allowed y's must be within a distance of d-1 from x.

So for each x, the number of possible transitions is (d - 1) * 2, but adjusted for the boundaries. Wait, no. Let's compute d = |x - b|. Then, the allowed y's must satisfy |y - x| < d. So y can be from x - (d-1) to x + (d-1), inclusive, except y=x. But also, y has to be between 1 and n.

So the actual range is from max(1, x - (d-1)) to min(n, x + (d-1)). The total possible y's in this range is (upper - lower + 1), minus 1 (since we exclude y=x). But only if x is within the range.

Wait, for example, if x=2, b=4, then d=2. So allowed y's must be |y-2| < 2. So y can be 1 or 3. So two options. Which matches the first sample.

So for each x, the number of possible y's is (lower_bound to upper_bound) -1 (excluding x itself). So the count is (upper - lower + 1 - 1) if x is in [lower, upper], otherwise (upper - lower + 1) (since x is outside the range, but that's impossible because x is part of the building). Wait, x is a valid floor (from 1 to n). So the initial x is a, which is in 1..n, and then each step is a valid y in 1..n, so x is always in 1..n.

Wait, but when d is 0? No, because b is not equal to a, and the initial a is not b. So in the problem statement, a and b are different. Then, for each step, the current x is not b (since the forbidden floor is b, but the trip is to y, which must satisfy the condition. Wait, no. Wait, the forbidden lab is on floor b, but the condition is |x - y| < |x - b|. So for example, if x is b, then |x - b|=0, so |y -x| must be less than 0, which is impossible. So if x is b, there are no possible y's. But how can x be b? Because the initial a is not b, but during the steps, can x become b?

Wait, the problem says that the forbidden lab is at b, but the rules for choosing y is that |x-y| < |x - b|. So even if x is not b, y can be any floor except x that satisfies the inequality. So x can be any floor except the forbidden lab's floor? Wait, no. For example, if x is 3, and b is 4, then allowed y's are those where |3-y| < 1. So |3-y| <1 → y must be 3, but y cannot equal x. So in this case, there are no possible y's. So in the third sample, the initial a is 3, and the forbidden is 4. So the first step must choose a y such that |3 - y| < |3-4|=1. So |3-y| <1 → y can be 3, but y can't be x. So no options. Hence output is 0.

So, in this case, if the current x is such that |x - b| is 0 (i.e., x = b), then there are no possible transitions. But since the initial a is not equal to b, the first step can't have x = b. But in subsequent steps, can x be b?

No. Because each step requires that y is chosen such that |x - y| < |x -b|. Suppose x was allowed to be b. Then |x - y| < 0, which is impossible. So in such a case, there are no possible transitions. But in order for x to be b, the previous step's y must have been b. But how? Because the previous step would have required that the previous x (say x_prev) is such that when choosing y=x_prev → |x_prev - y| < |x_prev -b|. Wait, no. The previous step's x_prev can be such that choosing y =b. But that's allowed only if |x_prev - b| < |x_prev -b|. Which is impossible. So y can never be b. Because the condition is |x_prev - y| < |x_prev - b|, and y can't be x_prev. So for y to be b, we need |x_prev -b| < |x_prev -b| → which is false. So y can never be b. So x can never be b. So in all steps, x is not b. So we can ignore the possibility of x being b.

So, for the DP, the state is the current x (from 1 to n, excluding b?), but since initial a is not b, and transitions can't reach b, perhaps we can model the state as x in 1..n, x != b. But even if x is allowed to be b (though impossible), the transitions would have zero options, so the DP would naturally account for that.

So, the DP approach:

- dp[i][x] = number of sequences of i trips ending at x.

For i=0, the initial state is a. But wait, the problem says that the trips are consecutive. The initial position is a. Then, for the first trip, you choose y based on a. So for the first step (i=1), the possible y's are those that satisfy the condition from a. Then, for each step after that, the next y depends on the previous x.

But how to model the initial state. Let's think:

For i=0, the number of sequences is 1 (the initial position a). Then, for each i from 1 to k, we compute the transitions.

Wait, but the problem says k consecutive trips. So if k=0, perhaps the answer is 1, but according to the problem statement, k is at least 1. Wait, no, the input constraints for k are 1 ≤ k ≤ 5000. So in the code, we have to process exactly k steps.

Wait, the input constraints say that k is between 1 and 5000. So each test case will have k ≥1.

Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement. The input constraints say:

1 ≤ k ≤ 5000. So k can be 1, 2, etc.

So for each step from 1 to k, the initial state is a, and each step must be a valid move.

So the DP approach would be:

Initialize dp[0][a] = 1.

Then, for each step from 1 to k:

For each possible x in the previous step (dp[i-1][x] >0), compute all possible y's that can be reached from x according to the condition. Sum the possibilities.

But with n up to 5000 and k up to 5000, this leads to O(k * n^2) time, which is 25e6 * 5e3 = 125e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

So we need a way to compute the transitions more efficiently.

The key insight here is that for each x, the number of possible next steps can be precomputed as a range. Then, for each x, the next steps contribute their current dp value multiplied by the number of possible y's. Wait, no. Because for each x, each next y is possible, so the transitions are additive. For each x, the number of sequences for step i is the sum of dp[i-1][x] multiplied by the number of possible y's from x.

Wait, no. Because each y can be reached from multiple x's. So the transitions are from x to y. So for each y in the next step, the number of ways is the sum over all x's where y is a possible next step from x of dp[i-1][x] * 1 (since each transition is a single choice). But in this case, for each x, the number of possible y's is variable, and for each y, you need to sum over all x's that can reach y.

But that's again O(n^2) per step.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps for each x, the number of possible y's is some count, and when you move from x to any y in that range (excluding x), the total contribution to the next step is dp_prev[x] multiplied by the count of possible y's. Wait, but that would be correct only if all the y's are unique and don't overlap with transitions from other x's. But that's not the case. For example, different x's may have overlapping ranges for y's. So this approach would not work.

Alternatively, perhaps for each x, we can compute the number of possible transitions, and then sum up the contributions. But this approach would not track the next y, but instead, track the cumulative sum. But this is unclear.

Wait, let's think of the transitions in terms of the next step. Let's say that for step i, the DP for y is the sum over all x such that y can be reached from x in one step of the DP[i-1][x].

But how can we compute this efficiently?

If for each x, we can precompute the range of y's that are allowed, then for each x, we can add dp_prev[x] to all y in that range, except y=x.

But doing this for each x by iterating over each y in the range is O(n^2) again.

So we need a way to compute the sum over all x that can reach y of dp_prev[x].

Hmm. Wait, perhaps we can precompute for each y, the set of x's that can reach y in one step. Then, for each step i, the value of dp[i][y] is the sum of dp[i-1][x] for x in the set that can reach y.

But this approach requires, for each y, knowing all x's that can reach it. However, this seems difficult to precompute for all y, but perhaps for each x, we can compute the range of possible y's, and then for each x, add the contribution of x to all y in that range (except x). Then, for each step, instead of iterating each x and each y in x's range, we can compute the contribution using prefix sums.

Yes! That's a key optimization. Using prefix sums. Let's think about this.

For each x, the possible y's form a contiguous interval (except for the exclusion of x). So for each x, the allowed y's are [low, high], excluding x. So, for each x, the contribution to dp[i] is adding dp_prev[x] to all y in [low, high], except x.

But adding to each y individually is O(n^2). But if we can represent the contributions as ranges and use a prefix sum array, then we can compute the ranges in O(n) per step.

Here's the idea:

For each step i, we can compute an array delta, which is the contribution to each y. For each x in 1..n:

- Compute the allowed y's [low, high], which is [x - (d-1), x + (d-1)], where d = |x - b|. But also clamped to 1 and n.

- Then, the y's are from low to high, except x (if x is within this range).

So the count is (high - low + 1) - 1 (if x is in [low, high]) else (high - low + 1).

Wait, but how to handle the exclusion of x?

The allowed y's are all in the interval [low, high], but y != x. So for the interval [low, high], the number of valid y's is (high - low + 1) - 1 if x is in [low, high], otherwise (high - low + 1).

But when we want to compute the contribution of x to the next step's dp, the contribution is dp_prev[x] * (number of valid y's for x). But wait, no. Because each y is a possible next step, and the number of sequences increases by dp_prev[x] for each y. So for each x, the total contribution to the next step is dp_prev[x] multiplied by the number of valid y's.

But the next step's dp[i][y] is the sum over all x where y is in x's valid y's.

Alternatively, for each x, the contribution is to all possible y's in its valid range except x. So the number of such y's is (high - low + 1) - (1 if x is in [low, high] else 0). Let's call this count m.

But each of these y's is added to their respective positions. So for each x, the contribution to the next step's dp is m * dp_prev[x], but each y in the valid range (except x) would have their dp[i][y] increased by dp_prev[x].

Wait, no. For example, if x has 2 possible y's (y1 and y2), then the contribution from x is to add dp_prev[x] to y1 and y2. So the next dp[i][y1] += dp_prev[x], and dp[i][y2] += dp_prev[x]. So the total contribution from x is 2 * dp_prev[x], but distributed across multiple y's.

So, to compute the next dp array, we need to sum for each y the number of x's that can reach it multiplied by their dp_prev[x].

But this is again O(n^2) unless we can find a way to compute the ranges and use prefix sums.

So here's the plan:

For each x in 1..n:

1. Compute d = abs(x - b). If d == 0, then there are no possible y's (but x can't be b, as discussed earlier). So skip.

2. Compute the allowed interval for y: [x - (d-1), x + (d-1)]. But clamp this to [1, n].

3. Now, the valid y's are all in [low, high], except x.

So the valid range is [low, x-1] union [x+1, high]. But if x is outside of [low, high], then the entire range is valid (since x isn't in it). For example, if low = 3, high =5, x=2. Then all y's in 3-5 are valid.

So, for each x, the valid y's can be represented as two intervals: from low to x-1, and x+1 to high. But if x is not in [low, high], then it's the entire interval.

But how to handle this? Because for each x, we need to add the contribution of dp_prev[x] to all y's in the valid ranges.

If we can model this as adding to ranges, then we can use a prefix sum array (difference array) to compute the next dp.

Let's see. For each x, for each of the valid y ranges (could be 0, 1, or 2 ranges), add dp_prev[x] to those ranges. Then, after processing all x, compute the prefix sum to get the next dp array.

Yes! This way, for each x, we can process its contribution to the ranges in O(1) time, leading to O(n) per step.

Here's how:

We can represent the next dp as a difference array. Let's call it next_dp, which is initially zero. For each x:

- Determine the valid ranges for y.

- For each range [a, b], we add dp_prev[x] to next_dp[a], and subtract dp_prev[x] from next_dp[b+1].

But then, after processing all x, we compute the prefix sum of next_dp to get the actual next_dp array.

But wait, the difference array approach allows us to accumulate the sum over ranges efficiently. For example, adding a value v to [L, R] can be done by adding v to diff[L], subtracting v from diff[R+1], and then the prefix sum gives the actual array.

So, for each x, compute the ranges of y's that are allowed. For each such range, add dp_prev[x] to the difference array for the next step. Then, after all x's are processed, compute the prefix sum of the difference array to get the next_dp array.

But how to handle the exclusion of x?

For each x, the valid y ranges are:

Case 1: x is not in [low, high]. Then, the valid range is [low, high]. So we can add this as a single range.

Case 2: x is in [low, high]. Then, the valid ranges are [low, x-1] and [x+1, high].

So, for each x, we first compute low and high. Then check if x is in [low, high].

If x is not in [low, high], then add the range [low, high].

If x is in [low, high], then add the ranges [low, x-1] and [x+1, high].

Once all ranges are processed using the difference array, the next_dp is the prefix sum of the difference array.

This approach would allow us to compute the next_dp in O(n) time per step, since each x contributes O(1) ranges (either one or two), and each range can be processed in O(1) time via the difference array.

So, the steps are:

- Initialize the DP array. For step 0, dp[0][a] = 1.

- For each step from 1 to k:

   a. Initialize a difference array (diff) of size n+2 (since floors are 1-based and we need to handle up to n+1 for the subtraction).

   b. For each x in 1..n where dp_prev[x] >0:

      i. Compute d = abs(x - b). If d ==0, skip (but x can't be b, so this is impossible).

      ii. low = max(1, x - (d-1))
          high = min(n, x + (d-1))
          if low > high:
              continue (no possible y's)
          if x < low or x > high:
              add the range [low, high]
          else:
              add ranges [low, x-1] and [x+1, high]
      iii. For each range [a, b] from the previous step:
              if a > b:
                  skip
              add dp_prev[x] to diff[a]
              subtract dp_prev[x] from diff[b+1]

   c. Compute the prefix sum of the diff array to get the next_dp array.

   d. Set dp_prev = next_dp.

- After k steps, sum all the values in dp_prev and return the result modulo 1e9+7.

But wait, the initial step is a. So for step 1, the initial dp_prev is the array with dp_prev[a] =1.

Yes.

Now, for each step, we process all x in 1..n where dp_prev[x] >0, which is possible since the previous step's dp_prev could have non-zero entries.

But in code, even if dp_prev[x] is zero, we can process it, but it won't contribute anything. So in code, we can loop through all x in 1..n, regardless of dp_prev[x]'s value, since if dp_prev[x] is zero, adding ranges with zero contribution won't affect the diff array.

But that would be O(n) per step, which is acceptable.

So, the code structure would be:

Initialize dp_prev as a list of zeros, except dp_prev[a] = 1.

mod = 10**9 +7

for _ in range(k):

    diff = [0]*(n+2)

    for x in range(1, n+1):

        cnt = dp_prev[x]

        if cnt ==0:

            continue

        d = abs(x - b)

        if d ==0:

            continue  # impossible, since a !=b and initial steps can't reach b

        low = x - (d-1)

        high = x + (d-1)

        low = max(1, low)

        high = min(n, high)

        if low > high:

            continue

        if x < low or x > high:

            # add [low, high]

            a = low

            b = high

            if a <=b:

                diff[a] += cnt

                diff[b+1] -= cnt

        else:

            # split into two ranges

            # left part: low to x-1

            a1 = low

            b1 = x-1

            if a1 <= b1:

                diff[a1] += cnt

                diff[b1+1] -= cnt

            # right part: x+1 to high

            a2 = x+1

            b2 = high

            if a2 <= b2:

                diff[a2] += cnt

                diff[b2+1] -= cnt

    # compute the next dp_prev

    next_dp = [0]*(n+1)  # 1-based

    current =0

    for y in range(1, n+1):

        current += diff[y]

        next_dp[y] = current % mod

    dp_prev = next_dp

After processing k steps, sum all elements in dp_prev and take modulo 1e9+7.

Wait, but why sum all? Because each sequence is a k-length sequence, and the final position can be any possible y. So the total sequences are the sum of all dp_prev[y] for y in 1..n.

Yes.

So the code would proceed as outlined.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

5 2 4 1

So n=5, a=2, b=4, k=1.

Step 1:

Initially, dp_prev is [0,0,1,0,0,0] (assuming 1-based, indexes 0..5, but perhaps better to use 1-based).

Then, for each x=1..5:

Only x=2 has cnt=1.

Compute d = abs(2-4) =2.

low = 2 -1 =1, high=2+1=3.

Check if x (2) is in [1,3] → yes.

So split into [1,1] and [3,3].

Add ranges [1,1] and [3,3].

For the first range, a=1, b=1: add 1 to diff[1], subtract 1 from diff[2].

For the second range, a=3, b=3: add 1 to diff[3], subtract 1 from diff[4].

So diff after x=2:

diff[1] +=1 → 1

diff[2] -=1 → -1

diff[3] +=1 →1

diff[4] -=1 →-1

Other positions are 0.

Then, compute next_dp:

current starts at 0.

y=1:

current +=1 →1 → next_dp[1] =1.

y=2:

current +=-1 →0 → next_dp[2] =0.

y=3:

current +=1 →1 → next_dp[3]=1.

y=4:

current +=-1 →0.

y=5: 0.

So next_dp is [0,1,0,1,0,0] (assuming 1-based, indexes 1-5).

Sum is 1+1=2 → which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input:

5 2 4 2

So k=2 steps.

First step is as sample 1, resulting in next_dp as [1,0,1,0,0] (but for the first step, after processing, next_dp[1] is 1, next_dp[3] is 1).

Then, step 2.

For each x in 1 and 3.

First, x=1, cnt=1.

d = abs(1-4) =3.

low =1-2= -1 → max(1, -1)=1.

high=1+2=3.

Check if x=1 is in [1,3] → yes.

So split into [1,0] (invalid) and [2,3].

Wait, x=1: low=1, high=3.

x is in the range, so split into left range (low to x-1 → 1 to 0 → invalid) and right range (x+1=2 to high=3).

So right range is 2-3.

Add 1 to diff[2], subtract 1 from diff[4].

So for x=1, diff[2] +=1, diff[4] -=1.

Then, x=3, cnt=1.

d=abs(3-4)=1.

low=3 -0=3 → max(3,1) →3.

high=3+0=3.

So low=3, high=3. Check if x=3 is in [3,3]. Yes.

Split into [3,2] (invalid) and [4,3] (invalid). So no ranges.

So no contribution from x=3.

So the diff array for step 2 is:

diff[2] +=1, diff[4] -=1.

Then, compute next_dp:

current starts at 0.

y=1: current=0 →0.

y=2: current +=0 (diff[2] is 1? Wait, perhaps I have a mistake here.

Wait, the diff array is initialized as [0]*(5+2) → 7 elements (indices 0-6).

Processing x=1:

range is 2-3.

So diff[2] +=1 → becomes 1.

diff[4] -=1 → becomes -1.

Then x=3: no ranges.

So diff after processing:

diff[0] =0

diff[1] =0

diff[2] =1

diff[3] =0

diff[4] =-1

diff[5] =0

diff[6] =0.

Then, compute the prefix sum:

y=1: current += diff[1] →0 →next_dp[1] =0.

y=2: current += diff[2] →1 →next_dp[2] =1.

y=3: current += diff[3] →1 → next_dp[3] =1.

y=4: current += diff[4] →0 → next_dp[4] =0.

y=5: current += diff[5] →0 → next_dp[5] =0.

So next_dp after step 2 is [0,0,1,1,0,0]. Sum is 1+1=2 → matches the sample.

So code seems correct.

Sample 3:

Input:

5 3 4 1.

a=3, b=4, k=1.

For x=3:

d=abs(3-4)=1.

low=3-0=3.

high=3+0=3.

So the range is [3,3], and x is in this range.

So split into [3,2] (invalid) and [4,3] (invalid). So no valid ranges. So no contributions.

Thus, after step 1, next_dp is all zeros. Sum is 0 → matches the sample.

So the code works for the samples.

Now, for the code.

We need to handle 1-based floor numbering.

The code will:

- Read n, a, b, k.

- Initialize dp_prev as [0]*(n+2), with dp_prev[a] =1.

- mod = 1e9+7.

- For each of the k steps:

   a. Create a diff array of size n+2.

   b. Iterate x from 1 to n:

      i. cnt = dp_prev[x]

      ii. if cnt is 0, skip.

      iii. compute d = abs(x - b)

      iv. if d ==0, continue (but x can't be b, since a !=b and previous steps can't reach b)

      v. compute low and high.

      vi. check if x is in [low, high]

      vii. split into ranges accordingly.

      viii. for each valid range [a, b], update the diff array.

   c. compute next_dp using prefix sums.

   d. set dp_prev = next_dp.

- After all steps, sum all elements in dp_prev and output mod 1e9+7.

Edge cases:

- When d=1. Then low =x -0 =x, high=x. So the interval is [x, x]. But x can't be y. So no valid y's → contribution is 0.

- When x is at the edge of the building, like x=1. Then low could be 1, high is x + (d-1). But if x=1 and b=3, d=2. Then low is 1-1=0 → max(1, 0) →1. high=1+1=2. So valid y's are 2 (since x=1 is in [1,2], so exclude x=1. So y can be 2. So contribution is 1.

So code needs to handle these cases.

Now, code:

Implement the steps as described.

The code should read the input, process k steps, and output the sum.

Testing in Python.

Now, code in Python:

But since n can be up to 5000 and k up to 5000, and each step is O(n), the total time is O(k*n) which is acceptable for Python.

But for the diff array, we need to be careful with the indices. Let's see:

In the code:

diff is a list of (n+2) elements. For each x, when adding a range [a, b], we do:

diff[a] += cnt

diff[b+1] -= cnt

Then, when building next_dp, for y in 1..n, current is the running sum, and next_dp[y] = current mod mod.

Yes.

So the code:

Read n, a, b, k.

mod = 10**9 +7

dp_prev = [0] * (n +2)  # indexes 0 to n+1. But we use 1..n.

dp_prev[a] =1

for _ in range(k):

    diff = [0]*(n+2)  # indices 0..n+1

    for x in range(1, n+1):

        cnt = dp_prev[x]

        if cnt ==0:

            continue

        d = abs(x - b)

        if d ==0:

            continue

        # compute low and high

        low = x - (d-1)

        high = x + (d-1)

        low = max(1, low)

        high = min(n, high)

        if low > high:

            continue

        # check if x is in [low, high]

        if x >= low and x <= high:

            # split into two ranges

            # left: low to x-1

            a1 = low

            b1 = x-1

            if a1 <= b1:

                diff[a1] += cnt

                diff[b1 +1] -= cnt

            # right: x+1 to high

            a2 = x+1

            b2 = high

            if a2 <= b2:

                diff[a2] += cnt

                diff[b2 +1] -= cnt

        else:

            # entire range is valid

            a = low

            b = high

            if a <=b:

                diff[a] += cnt

                diff[b+1] -= cnt

    # compute next_dp

    next_dp = [0]*(n+2)  # 1..n

    current =0

    for y in range(1, n+1):

        current += diff[y]

        next_dp[y] = current % mod

    dp_prev, next_dp = next_dp, dp_prev  # swap to reuse memory, but in Python, assignment is by reference. Wait, no. In code, for each step, we create a new next_dp. So dp_prev is replaced by next_dp.

    # Wait, no. After building next_dp, set dp_prev = next_dp.copy()?

    # Wait, in the code above, after the loop over y, next_dp is a new list. So in the code:

    # After building next_dp, dp_prev is assigned to next_dp. So in the next iteration, the loop uses the new dp_prev.

    # But in Python, lists are mutable. So after 'dp_prev = next_dp', dp_prev refers to the same list as next_dp. But in the code above, next_dp is a new list each time.

    # So the code is correct.

    # Wait, in the code:

    # next_dp is initialized as a list of zeros, then filled.

    # Then dp_prev is assigned to next_dp. So each step creates a new list.

    # So after the loop, dp_prev points to the new list.

    # So the code is correct.

# Finally, sum all elements in dp_prev[1..n]

total =0

for y in range(1, n+1):

    total = (total + dp_prev[y]) % mod

print(total)

Yes.

Sample 3:

n=5, a=3, b=4, k=1.

x=3.

d=abs(3-4)=1.

low=3-0=3, high=3+0=3.

x is in [3,3]. Split into [3,2] (invalid) and [4,3] (invalid). So no ranges. So diff remains 0.

Thus, next_dp is all zeros. Sum is 0.

Thus, code works.

Now, code seems correct.
