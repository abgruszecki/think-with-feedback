Okay, I need to solve this problem where the goal is to find the minimal compressed version of a given string. The compression involves splitting the string into parts where each part is repeated some number of times. For each part, we have the count (as a string without leading zeros) and the base string. The total length is the sum of the lengths of all the count strings and the base strings. My task is to find the arrangement that gives the minimal total length.

First, let's understand the problem with some examples. For instance, if the input is "aaaaaaaaaa" (10 a's), the best compression is "10a", which gives a total length of 3 (since 2 digits for 10 and 1 character for 'a'). Another example is "abcab" which can't be split into any repeated parts except the entire string once, so the total is 1 (for "1") +5 (for "abcab") = 6. The third example is split into parts like 'cc' (so count is 2, length 1), then 'z' (count 1, length 1), then 'abababab' which is 4 times 'ab' (count is 4, length 1, and 'ab' is length 2). So total is 1+1 +1+1 +1+2 = 7.

So the approach is to find the best way to split the string into consecutive segments, each of which is a repetition of some base string. For each possible split, we compute the minimal length for the compressed version up to that point.

This feels like a dynamic programming problem. The idea is to compute dp[i], which is the minimal length of the compressed string up to the i-th character (0-based or 1-based, depending on how we index). Then, for each position i, we look back at all possible j < i, and check if the substring s[j+1..i] can be formed by repeating a certain base string multiple times. For each possible split, we calculate the cost (number of digits in the count plus the length of the base string) plus dp[j], and take the minimum over all possible j.

The key steps are:

1. Precompute for every possible substring (from j to i) what is the maximum possible repetition count. For example, the substring "ababab" can be divided into 3 repetitions of "ab". The count here is 3, which is represented as '3' (length 1), and the base is "ab" (length 2). So the contribution to the total length is 1 + 2 = 3. But if we split into "ab" once, the contribution would be 1 + 2 = 3. Wait, but taking the maximum possible repetition here gives the same cost. So, perhaps for each possible substring, we need to check all possible possible ways of splitting into k repetitions and choose the one that gives the minimal cost for that split.

But how do we efficiently find the best k for each possible substring?

For a substring s[j..i], the possible k values are those where the substring can be divided into k copies of a base string. For example, the substring length must be divisible by k. So for a substring of length l, possible k ranges from 1 to l. But for each possible divisor d of l, where d is the number of repetitions, we can check if the substring is made of d copies of a base string of length l/d.

So for each j and i (i > j), the substring s[j+1..i] (assuming 1-based) has length len = i - j. For each possible d that divides len, we can check if the substring can be divided into d copies of a base string of length len/d. If so, then for this possible split, the cost would be the number of digits in d (digits in the count) plus the length of the base string (len/d). Then, the minimal cost for this split is min over all possible d (including d=1, which would mean taking the entire substring as a base and count 1).

Wait, but when d=1, then the count is 1 (digits length 1) and the base is the entire substring (length len). So the cost is 1 + len. Alternatively, maybe for some larger d, the cost is smaller. For example, when the substring is made of multiple copies of a shorter base, the sum of (digits of d) + (base length) could be smaller.

So, for each possible j and i, and for each possible d that divides len, we can compute if the substring can be split into d copies of a base string. For each such possible d, we compute the cost for that split (digits in d + base length) and then the total cost would be dp[j] + this cost. We need to take the minimum over all possible j and d for each i.

But this approach would be O(n^3) in the worst case, which could be a problem for n=8000, since 8000^3 is 5e11 operations. That's way too big.

So we need to optimize this.

Alternative idea: For each possible end position i, and for each possible start position j, compute the best possible split for the substring s[j..i]. Then, for dynamic programming, the recurrence would be dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + cost(j, i)) for all j from 1 to i.

The problem is calculating cost(j, i) efficiently. How can we compute the minimal cost for the substring from j to i?

The cost for a substring s[j..i] is the minimal over all possible possible splits into k copies of a base string. So for each possible k (from 1 up to i-j+1), if the substring can be divided into k copies of some string, then compute the cost as len(str(k)) + len(base), and take the minimal such cost.

But for each substring, the number of possible k's is up to O(len), which for len up to 8000 is manageable, but multiplied by O(n^2) substrings, this becomes O(n^3), which is not feasible.

So we need a way to compute the minimal cost for a substring s[j..i] quickly.

Alternative approach: For a given substring s[j..i], the minimal possible cost is the minimal between taking the entire substring as a single part (cost: 1 + len) and any possible k>1 where the substring is a repetition.

So, for each possible substring, we can check all possible possible k values (number of repetitions) greater than 1. For each possible k that divides the length of the substring, check if the substring is made of k copies of a base string. If so, compute the cost (digits(k) + len(base)), and compare it with the cost of taking k=1.

So, for each substring, the minimal cost is min between (1 + len) and the minimal cost over all possible valid k>1.

So for each substring, we need to find the best possible k (could be 1 or higher) that gives the minimal cost.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let's think about the steps:

For each possible j (start) and i (end) of the substring (j < i), the substring has length l = i-j+1.

For each possible k that divides l, check if the substring can be split into k copies of a base string of length l/k. For each such k, compute the cost as len(str(k)) + (l/k). The minimal cost for this substring is the minimal such cost over all possible k (including k=1).

But for a substring of length l, the number of possible k's that divide l is O(l), which for l up to 8000 is 8000. So for each substring, this would take O(l) time. And since there are O(n^2) possible substrings, the total time is O(n^3) which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter way to compute this.

Alternative idea: For each possible position j, and for possible lengths of the base string (m), compute the maximum possible k for which the substring s[j..j+m*k-1] can be split into k copies of s[j..j+m-1]. Then, for each j and m, we can precompute for each possible k the maximum possible k. But again, how to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, for each possible j and m (length of the base), check how far the base repeats.

But even this could be O(n^3) in the worst case.

Wait, but maybe for each position j, and for each possible m (base length), we can check how many times the base repeats starting at j.

For example, for j=0 and m=2, check how many times the substring s[0..1] repeats. The maximum possible k is the largest integer such that j + m*k <= n, and s[j..j+m-1] is equal to s[j + m*i.. j + m*(i+1) -1] for all i in 0..k-1.

This can be computed by checking for each possible m starting at j, and for each possible k, whether all the m-length chunks in the substring are equal.

But again, for n=8000, and j up to 8000, m up to 8000, this would be O(n^3) time.

So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. So perhaps we need a way to precompute, for each possible j and m, the maximum possible k such that the substring starting at j with length m*k is made of k copies of the base.

An alternative approach is to precompute for all possible j and m the maximum possible repetition count. This can be done using a rolling hash. For example, compute the hash for the base (s[j..j+m-1]), then check if the next m characters are the same, and so on. For each j and m, the maximum possible k is the number of consecutive repeats of the base.

This way, for each j and m, we can compute the maximum possible k in O(n/m) time. Summing over all j and m would be O(n^2) time (since for each m, the sum over j of n/m is n^2/m * m) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

The total number of possible m is up to n. For each m, the number of possible j is up to n - m + 1. For each j and m, the maximum possible k is floor((n-j)/m). For example, for m=1, the maximum k is (n-j), but for larger m, it's less.

But computing the maximum k for each j and m would involve checking how many times the base repeats. For each j and m, the maximum possible k is the largest k where s[j..j+m*k-1] is made of k copies of s[j..j+m-1].

How can we compute this efficiently?

An alternative idea is to precompute the prefix function for the KMP algorithm. The prefix function for a string s is an array π where π[i] is the length of the longest prefix of s that is also a suffix. For a substring s[j..i], the maximum possible period (the base length) can be determined using the prefix function. The minimal period is (i-j+1) - π[i-j], where π is computed for the substring. If the length is divisible by the minimal period, then the maximum possible k is length / period. Otherwise, the maximum possible k is 1.

This could be helpful. For example, for a substring of length l, the minimal period p is l - π[l-1]. If l % p == 0, then the substring can be divided into l/p copies of the base of length p. So for each possible substring, the maximum possible k is l/p. But this is only when the entire substring is made of k copies of the base. So for each substring, the maximum possible k is l/p if l is divisible by p. Otherwise, it's 1.

So for a substring of length l, the maximum possible k is l/p, but only if the entire substring can be split into k copies of the base of length p. But how do we compute this for all possible substrings efficiently?

The problem is that for each possible substring s[j..i], we need to compute the minimal period p. Then, if l (the length of the substring) is divisible by p, then the maximum possible k is l/p, and the cost would be len(str(k)) + p. Otherwise, the maximum possible k is 1, and the cost is 1 + l.

So for each possible substring, the minimal possible cost is the minimum between taking k=1 (cost 1 + l) and taking the maximum possible k (cost len(str(k)) + p).

Wait, but maybe there's a k between 1 and the maximum possible that gives a better cost. For example, if the maximum possible k is 4, but k=2 gives a better cost. So we need to check all possible k that divides l and for which the substring can be split into k copies of a base string.

But how to find all possible k's for a substring?

Alternatively, for each possible substring, the minimal possible cost can be found by checking all possible k that are divisors of the maximum possible k (i.e., the number of possible repetitions based on the minimal period). Let me think.

For example, if the maximum possible k is 4 (so l = 4*p), then possible k's are 2, 4 (since 4 is the maximum, but maybe 2 is a divisor of 4). For each possible divisor d of the maximum k, the cost would be len(str(d)) + (p * (max_k / d)) ? Wait, no. Because if the maximum k is 4, and we split into d copies, then the base length would be (p * (max_k / d)). For example, if the max k is 4 (so the base is p, repeated 4 times), then d=2 would split into 2 copies of a base of length 2*p. Then, the cost is len(str(2)) + (2*p). But maybe this is better than taking d=4 (len(str(4)) + p).

So for each possible divisor d of the maximum k (which is l/p), we can compute the cost as len(str(d)) + (l/(d * p) * p) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the substring has length l. The minimal period is p, so the maximum possible k is l/p (only if l is divisible by p). So the base is length p, and the substring is k copies of this base. But perhaps there's a larger base. For example, if the substring is 'abababab' (length 8), the minimal period is 2, maximum k is 4. But you could also split it into 2 copies of 'abab' (length 4), which would have k=2 and base length 4. So the cost for k=2 would be len('2') +4 = 1+4=5, whereas for k=4, len('4') +2=1+2=3. So taking the maximum k gives a better cost.

But maybe in some cases, a smaller k could be better. For example, if the maximum k is 100, then len(str(100)) is 3, but if we split into 50 copies, the cost would be len('50') (2) + base length (2p). So 2 + 2p. If 2p is smaller than p +3 (3 comes from len(100)), then it's better. But this depends on p.

So perhaps for each possible divisor of the maximum k, we can compute the cost and choose the minimal.

But how to find all the divisors of the maximum k (l/p) efficiently.

Alternatively, for a given maximum k, which is l/p, we can iterate through all possible divisors of k (d), and for each d, the cost would be len(str(d)) + (l/(d*p) * p) = len(d) + l/(d*p) * p = len(d) + l/(d) * (p/p) ? Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, if the maximum possible k is k_max = l/p, then the base is p. But if we split into d copies, where d divides k_max, then the base would be (p * (k_max /d)), and the count is d. For example, if the substring is 'abababab', which is k_max=4 copies of 'ab' (p=2). If d=2, then the base is 'abab' (p*2), and the count is 2. So the cost is len(str(2)) +4. So 1+4=5. But if we take d=4, the cost is 1+2=3.

So for each possible divisor d of k_max, the cost is len(str(d)) + (p * (k_max/d)).

But how do we find all possible divisors d of k_max?

Alternatively, for a given k_max, iterate all possible d in the divisors of k_max. For example, if k_max is 4, then the divisors are 1,2,4. For each d, compute the cost len(d) + (k_max /d) * p. Then take the minimal cost among these.

Wait, but in this case, the minimal cost for the substring would be the minimal among:

- the cost when taking d=1 (the entire substring as a base, cost 1 + l).

- the minimal cost from the divisors of k_max (len(d) + (p * (k_max/d))).

Wait, no. Because when we split into d copies, the base length is (p * (k_max/d)), which is the original p multiplied by (k_max/d). The count is d, so len(d) digits. So the cost is len(d) + (p * (k_max/d)).

So for each divisor d of k_max, compute that cost and choose the minimal. Also, compare with the cost of not splitting (d=1, cost 1 + l).

But this requires that the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length (p * (k_max/d)), which is only possible if the substring is made of d copies of that longer base.

Wait, but if the substring is made of k_max copies of the base of length p, then it's also made of d copies of a longer base, where d is a divisor of k_max. For example, if k_max is 4, then d=2, the longer base is 2p. So the substring is 2 copies of 2p. So yes, this is possible.

So for each substring that can be split into k_max copies of a base of length p, then for each divisor d of k_max, we can split it into d copies of a base of length (p * (k_max/d)), which is valid.

Thus, the minimal cost for the substring is the minimum between:

- the cost of not splitting (1 + l).

- the minimal cost over all possible divisors d of k_max (len(d) + (p * (k_max/d))).

So the steps for each substring would be:

1. Compute the minimal period p using KMP's prefix function.

2. If l (length of substring) is not divisible by p, then the substring can't be split into multiple copies of a base. So the only option is k=1, cost is 1 + l.

3. Else, compute k_max = l/p.

   a. Find all divisors of k_max.

   b. For each divisor d of k_max, compute the cost len(d) + (p * (k_max/d)).

   c. Find the minimal cost among these and compare with the cost of not splitting (1 + l).

   d. Take the minimal between the two.

But how do we compute the minimal period p for a substring?

To compute the minimal period of a substring s[j..i], we can compute the prefix function for that substring. The minimal period is l - π[l-1], where l is the length of the substring. Then, if l is divisible by p, then the substring can be split into l/p copies of the base. Otherwise, the minimal period is l, and the substring can't be split.

But for each possible substring s[j..i], we need to compute the prefix function. However, for n=8000, there are O(n^2) possible substrings, each of which could be up to 8000 characters. So computing the prefix function for each substring would be O(n^3) time, which is not feasible.

This is a problem. So we need a way to compute the minimal period for all possible substrings efficiently.

Alternative idea: Precompute the prefix function for all possible substrings. But how?

Another approach: For each possible starting index j, compute the prefix function for all substrings starting at j and ending at i >=j. This way, for each j, we can compute the prefix function for the substring s[j..i] as i increases. For example, for j fixed, we can process i from j to n-1, building the prefix function incrementally.

Let me think. The standard KMP prefix function for a string s is an array π where π[i] is the length of the longest prefix (of the substring s[0..i]) which is also a suffix. For the substring s[j..i], we can model it as a new string, and compute its prefix function. But how to do this for all j?

Alternatively, for each j, we can build the prefix function for the substring s[j..n-1], and for each possible i >=j, compute the π value for the substring s[j..i] in that context.

This is possible. For each j, we can process the substring starting at j, and for each position i (from j to n-1), compute the π value for the substring s[j..i]. This would take O(n^2) time in total, which for n=8000 is 64 million operations. That's manageable.

Once we have the π values for all possible substrings, then for each substring s[j..i], we can compute the minimal period p as (i-j+1) - π[i-j] (assuming the substring has length l = i-j+1, and the π array is built for the substring starting at j). If l % p == 0, then the maximum k is l/p, else k=1.

So, steps:

1. Precompute for all possible j, the prefix function arrays for the substring s[j..n-1]. For each j, this array will have size (n-j), and for each i in [j, n-1], the corresponding π value for the substring s[j..i].

2. For each possible substring s[j..i], compute l = i-j+1, p = l - π[i-j] (since the substring is s[j..i], which is of length l, the π array for the substring starts at j, so the index in the π array for the substring is (i-j)).

   a. Check if l % p == 0. If yes, then k_max = l/p.

   b. Else, k_max =1.

3. For each possible j and i, compute the minimal cost for the substring s[j..i] as follows:

   a. If k_max ==1: cost is 1 + l.

   b. Else, compute all divisors d of k_max. For each d, compute the cost len(d) + (p * (k_max/d)). Find the minimal such cost. Then compare this with the cost of not splitting (1 + l). Take the minimal of these.

So, for each substring, the minimal cost is the minimal between the cost of splitting into d copies (for the best d) and the cost of not splitting.

But even this approach requires for each substring to compute the divisors of k_max. How can this be done efficiently?

Well, for a given k_max, which can be up to l/p, which for l=8000 and p=1 (a substring of all the same characters), k_max can be 8000. So the maximum possible k_max is 8000.

The number of divisors of a number up to 8000 is manageable. For example, 8000 has divisors 1,2,4,5, etc. So for each k_max, finding its divisors can be done in O(sqrt(k_max)) time.

But for each substring, this would take O(sqrt(k_max)) time. For n=8000, there are about 8000^2=64 million substrings. If for each we need O(sqrt(8000))=90 steps, that's 64 million * 90 = 5.76e9 operations. That's way too much.

So we need to optimize this part.

Alternative idea: Precompute all possible numbers up to 8000 and their divisors. But even this, for each k_max up to 8000, precompute the list of divisors, which takes O(8000 * sqrt(8000)) time. That's manageable.

Yes, this can be done. So precompute for all numbers from 1 to 8000, their divisors. Then, for any k_max, we can retrieve the list of divisors in O(1) time.

So first, we can precompute a list of divisors for all possible k_max up to 8000. Then, for each substring, when k_max is known, we can quickly get all its divisors.

So steps for the solution:

1. Precompute divisors for all numbers up to 8000.

2. For each j in 0..n-1:

   a. Compute the prefix function array for the substring starting at j.

3. For each possible substring s[j..i], compute l = i-j+1, p = l - π[i-j], check if l%p ==0.

   a. If not, then the minimal cost for this substring is 1 + l.

   b. Else, k_max = l/p.

      i. Get the list of divisors of k_max.

      ii. For each divisor d, compute the cost len(str(d)) + (p * (k_max/d)).

      iii. Find the minimal cost among these divisors.

      iv. Compare this minimal cost with 1 + l. Take the smaller one.

4. Use dynamic programming to find the minimal total cost. dp[i] represents the minimal cost for the first i characters.

   a. dp[0] =0.

   b. For each i from 1 to n:

      i. For each j from 0 to i-1:

         - Compute the cost of the substring s[j..i-1] (since Python uses 0-based indices, i-1 is the end).

         - dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + cost(j, i-1))

      ii. So for each i, iterate j from 0 to i-1, compute the cost and update dp[i].

But this is O(n^2) time, which for n=8000 is 64 million operations. And each operation involves computing the cost of the substring, which for some cases involves iterating over divisors. However, in the worst case, this could be O(64 million * 90) operations, which is way too slow.

So the problem is that even with precomputing the divisors, the dynamic programming step is O(n^2) multiplied by the average number of divisors per k_max. For n=8000, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For the dynamic programming step, perhaps we can find a way to compute the cost(j, i) in O(1) time, avoiding the loop over divisors.

Wait, but even if we compute the minimal cost for each substring in O(1) time, the DP would still be O(n^2), which may be manageable. So how to compute the minimal cost for each substring in O(1) time?

If we can precompute for all possible (j, i) pairs the minimal cost, then during the DP step, we can just look up the precomputed value. But precomputing all (j, i) pairs' minimal costs is O(n^2) time, which is feasible if each pair's cost can be computed in O(1) time (after the precomputing steps).

So, the steps would be:

- Precompute divisors for all numbers up to 8000.

- Precompute for all possible j and i, the minimal cost of the substring s[j..i].

But how?

Well, for each j and i, we can compute the minimal cost as follows:

1. Compute l = i-j+1.

2. Compute the minimal period p using the precomputed prefix function.

3. Check if l mod p ==0.

   a. If not, cost is 1 + l.

   b. Else, k_max = l/p.

      i. Find all divisors of k_max.

      ii. For each divisor d, compute cost = len(d) + p * (k_max/d).

      iii. Find the minimal such cost.

      iv. Compare with 1 + l and take the minimal.

So precomputing the minimal cost for all possible j and i would require O(n^2 * d) operations, where d is the average number of divisors per k_max. For n=8000, this is 64 million * 90 ≈ 5.76e9 operations. That's way too slow.

Alternative Idea: Precompute for all possible j and i, the minimal cost for the substring, but find a way to compute it in O(1) time.

But I don't see a way to do that.

Alternative Idea: During the dynamic programming step, for each i, iterate j from i-1 down to 0 (or vice versa), and for each j, compute the cost for the substring s[j..i] in O(1) time. But how?

Alternatively, find for each j and i the minimal cost in O(1) time.

But perhaps the minimal cost can be determined based on the minimal period and the k_max.

For example, if the minimal cost for the substring is the minimal between 1 + l and the minimal divisor-based cost.

The minimal divisor-based cost is found by finding the divisor d of k_max that gives the minimal len(d) + p*(k_max/d).

This is a function of k_max and p.

We can precompute for all possible k and p the minimal cost, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each k_max and p, the minimal cost is the minimal of len(d) + p*(k_max/d) for all d dividing k_max.

But how to compute this efficiently.

For example, if k_max is 100 and p is 2, the minimal cost is the minimal over all divisors d of 100: len(str(d)) + 2*(100/d).

We can precompute for each possible k_max and p the minimal cost. But k_max can be up to 8000, p can be up to 8000. So the number of possible (k_max, p) pairs is 8000 * 8000 = 64 million, which is too much.

Alternative Idea: For a given k_max, the minimal cost for any p is determined by the minimal (len(d) + p*(k_max/d)) for d dividing k_max. But how to compute this for a given k_max and p quickly.

Alternatively, for a given k_max, the minimal cost is len(d) + (k_max/d) * p, where d is a divisor of k_max. This can be rewritten as p * (k_max/d) + len(d). For a fixed k_max and d, this is a linear function in p. So for each k_max and d, the minimal cost depends on p. But I'm not sure how to exploit this.

Alternatively, for each possible k_max, precompute the minimal value of (k_max/d) * p + len(d) over all divisors d of k_max, given p.

But this still requires knowing p for each substring.

Hmm. So perhaps, given that the minimal cost for the substring is either 1 + l, or the minimal (len(d) + p*(k_max/d)), we can precompute for each possible k_max the minimal len(d) + k_max/d (since p is fixed as l/p = k_max / (l/p) ? Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, in the case where l is divisible by p, k_max is l/p, and p is the minimal period. So the base string is of length p. So if we split into d copies, the base string length is p * (k_max/d) = p * ( (l/p) /d ) = l/(d) ?

Wait, k_max = l/p. So when we split into d copies, the base length is (l/p)/d * p = l/(d). So the base length is l/d. Then the cost is len(str(d)) + (l/d). 

Ah! Because the base length is l/d (since you're splitting into d copies of a base of length l/d). Because the entire substring is l long, so d * (l/d) = l.

So the cost is len(d) + (l/d).

Wait, this changes everything. So for any possible d that divides k_max (which is l/p), the cost is len(d) + (l/d). Because the base length is l/d, and the count is d.

But l is equal to p * k_max. So l/d = p * (k_max /d). So the cost is len(d) + p * (k_max /d).

But k_max = l/p. So l/d = p * (k_max/d) = p * ( (l/p) /d ) = l/(d).

So regardless of p and k_max, the cost is len(d) + l/d.

Wait, this is a critical realization. So for a substring of length l that can be split into d copies of a base string (where d is a divisor of k_max = l/p), the cost is len(d) + (l/d). This is independent of p. Because the base length is l/d.

Wait, this is a big insight. For example, the cost is len(d) + (base length), which is len(d) + (l/d). Because d * base length = l. So base length is l/d.

But how does this relate to the minimal period p?

Ah, the minimal period p is the smallest possible period. So when we split into d copies, the base length can be any multiple of p. For example, if the minimal period is 2, the base could be 2,4,6 etc. But the cost is len(d) + (l/d), where d is the number of copies. So for a given l, the minimal cost for possible d is the minimal len(d) + l/d, where d divides some possible k_max (d must be a divisor of l/m for some m which is a period of the substring).

But wait, in order for d to be a valid split, the substring must be able to be split into d copies of a base of length l/d. So for a substring of length l, the possible d's are all divisors of possible k_max values, but k_max is l/p where p is a period of the substring.

But this seems complicated. However, the key insight is that for any d that divides some k_max, where the substring is made of d copies of a base of length l/d, the cost is len(d) + l/d.

But how do we know which d's are possible for a given substring?

Ah, any d that divides l, and such that the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length l/d.

But to find all possible d's for a substring, we need to check if l/d is a possible period. But this is the same as checking if the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length l/d.

But this is the same as checking if l/d is a period of the substring. And the minimal period p must divide l/d.

Alternatively, the minimal period p must be a divisor of any period of the substring. So, for a substring to be split into d copies of a base of length l/d, the minimal period p must divide l/d.

But this is getting complicated. However, the key insight here is that for a substring of length l, the possible d's are all possible divisors of l for which the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length l/d. But checking for all possible d's would require O(l) time per substring, which is not feasible.

But what if we can find for each possible l, the minimal possible cost over all possible d's that divide l and that split the substring into d copies of the base. Then, for each substring, the minimal cost is the minimal between 1 + l (not splitting) and the minimal len(d) + l/d over all possible valid d's.

But how to find the minimal len(d) + l/d for valid d's.

But how do we know which d's are valid for a given substring?

Alternative Idea: For any substring of length l, the minimal possible cost when splitting is the minimal len(d) + l/d for all d's that are divisors of l, and for which the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length l/d.

But this requires checking for each divisor of l whether the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length l/d. This is O(number of divisors of l) per substring, which could be feasible.

But for n=8000, the number of substrings is O(n^2) =64 million, and each has O(d) divisors (d being up to ~100 for large l), this would be 6.4 billion operations, which may be manageable.

But how to check quickly if a substring can be split into d copies of a base.

To check if a substring can be split into d copies of a base of length m = l/d, the substring must have m repeated d times. So for each possible divisor d of l, we can check if all blocks of m characters are equal.

But how to do this efficiently.

For example, for substring s[j..j+l-1], and m = l/d, we can check if s[j..j+m-1] is repeated d times.

But for each d, this requires checking d-1 times whether s[j +k*m .. j + (k+1)*m -1] equals the first block. This would take O(d*m) time per d.

Which for d up to 8000, and l=8000, would take O(8000) per d, which multiplied by the number of divisors (say 100) would be 800,000 operations per substring. For 64 million substrings, this is 5e13 operations, which is way too slow.

This is not feasible.

So, what's the alternative?

We need a way to find for each substring s[j..i], the minimal possible cost by considering all possible d's (divisors of l) that are valid (i.e., the substring can be split into d copies of a base of length m = l/d), and find the minimal len(d) + m.

But this seems computationally intensive.

Alternative Idea: Use hashing to quickly compare the blocks. Precompute a rolling hash for the entire string, and for each possible substring and possible m, check if all blocks are the same.

This way, for a given substring s[j..i], l = i-j+1. For each divisor d of l, compute m = l/d, and check if s[j..j+m-1] equals s[j+m..j+2m-1], and so on for all d blocks.

Using a rolling hash, each check can be done in O(1) time per block. But there are d-1 blocks to check, which for d up to 8000 is O(d) time. Again, for each substring and each divisor d, this is O(d) time. Which is still O(n^2 * d) time.

Not feasible for n=8000.

So, what's the way forward?

Perhaps we need to find that for a substring to be split into d copies, the minimal period p must be a divisor of m = l/d. So for the substring to be split into d copies of m, the minimal period p must divide m. And m must divide l. So the minimal period p must divide m, which is l/d.

But how does this help?

Alternatively, the minimal period p for the substring must divide m. So m must be a multiple of p. So, when checking for possible d's, it's sufficient to consider d's where m = l/d is a multiple of the minimal period p.

But since we don't know p in advance, this doesn't help.

Alternative Idea: Re-express d in terms of the minimal period. Let's say the minimal period is p. Then, l = p * k_max. So, the possible d's must divide k_max. Because when you split into d copies, the base length is l/d = (p*k_max)/d = p*(k_max/d). So for the base length to be a multiple of p (so that the entire substring is made of copies of the base), d must divide k_max.

So the possible valid d's are the divisors of k_max. Because d divides k_max, the base length is p*(k_max/d), which is a multiple of p, so the entire substring can be split into d copies.

So, the possible d's are the divisors of k_max. And k_max = l/p. So, for each substring that has a minimal period p and l divisible by p, then the possible d's are the divisors of k_max.

Thus, the minimal cost for such a substring is the minimal len(d) + (l/d) over all divisors d of k_max, compared with the cost of not splitting (1+l).

But even this requires knowing k_max for each substring.

But how to compute k_max efficiently.

But if we can compute the minimal period p for each substring, then k_max is l/p (if l mod p ==0), else k_max=1.

So, steps:

For each substring s[j..i], l = i-j+1.

Compute p via the prefix function.

If l mod p !=0, then the only option is cost 1 + l.

Else, k_max = l/p.

Then, compute all divisors of k_max.

For each divisor d, compute cost = len(str(d)) + (l/d).

Take the minimal between these costs and 1 + l.

So, the cost for the substring is min(1 + l, min_{d|k_max} (len(d) + (l/d))).

But the key is to compute the minimal period p for the substring quickly, which we can do via the prefix function.

So, the plan is:

1. Precompute divisors for all numbers up to 8000.

2. Precompute for all j in 0..n-1, the prefix function for the substring s[j..n-1]. For each j, this is O(n) time, and overall O(n^2) time.

3. For each possible substring (j, i):

   a. Compute l = i-j+1.

   b. Compute the minimal period p as l - π_j[i-j], where π_j is the prefix function array starting at j.

   c. Check if l mod p ==0. If not, cost is 1 + l.

   d. Else, compute k_max = l/p.

   e. Get all divisors of k_max.

   f. For each divisor d, compute cost = len(str(d)) + (l/d).

   g. Find the minimal cost among these and compare with 1 + l.

   h. Store this minimal cost as the cost for substring (j, i).

4. Use dynamic programming to compute the minimal total cost. dp[i] is the minimal cost for the first i characters.

   a. Initialize dp[0] =0.

   b. For each i from 1 to n:

      i. dp[i] = min(dp[j] + cost(j, i-1)) for all j from 0 to i-1.

But again, this is O(n^2) time, which for n=8000 is 64 million operations. But each of these operations involves looking up a precomputed cost for (j, i). However, how can we precompute all the costs (j, i) efficiently?

Yes. Precomputing all the costs (j, i) is O(n^2) time, but each step requires O(1) time (since the divisors are precomputed).

So steps:

- Precompute all divisors for numbers up to 8000.

- Precompute the prefix function arrays for all j.

- Precompute the cost for all (j, i) pairs.

Then, perform the dynamic programming step.

But for the precompute cost step:

For each j in 0..n-1:

   For i in j..n-1:

      compute cost(j, i).

This is O(n^2) time.

Each cost(j, i) computation involves:

- Compute l = i-j+1.

- Get the minimal period p.

- Check if l mod p ==0.

- Compute k_max = l/p.

- Get divisors of k_max.

- Compute the minimal cost among the divisors and 1 + l.

The computation of the minimal period p is O(1) time, since the prefix function is precomputed.

The rest steps are O(d) time for each substring, where d is the number of divisors of k_max.

But since the divisors are precomputed, it's O(1) to retrieve them.

So, the total time for precomputing all costs is O(n^2) * average number of divisors per k_max.

For n=8000, this is 64 million * average d.

Average d is around 8 (since for numbers up to 8000, the average number of divisors is about 8). So total operations would be 64 million *8 = 512 million, which is manageable.

So, this approach is feasible.

Now, let's outline the code steps.

First, precompute the divisors for all numbers up to 8000.

How to precompute divisors:

Initialize a list of lists, divisors, where divisors[k] is a list of all divisors of k.

For each number from 1 to 8000:

   For each divisor d from 1 to sqrt(k):

      if k %d ==0:

         add d to divisors[k].

         if d != k/d:

             add k/d to divisors[k].

   Then, sort the list of divisors for each k.

But for our purpose, we need all the divisors of k_max, which can be up to 8000/p. But p is at least 1, so k_max can be up to 8000.

So precompute divisors up to 8000.

But wait, when l is 8000 and p is 1, then k_max is 8000. So the maximum possible k_max is 8000.

So the precomputed divisors must cover up to 8000.

Yes.

Now, precompute the divisors.

Then, for each j in 0 to n-1:

   compute the prefix function for the substring s[j..n-1].

The prefix function for a string s is computed as follows:

Initialize π as an array of zeros with the same length as s.

For each i from 1 to len(s)-1:

   k = π[i-1]

   while k>0 and s[i] != s[k]:

       k = π[k-1]

   if s[i] == s[k]:

       k +=1

   π[i] =k

So for each j, the substring is s[j..], and for each i in j to n-1, the position in the substring is (i-j), and the π array for the substring is built accordingly.

So for each j, we need to generate the π array for s[j..n-1].

Now, after precomputing all π arrays, for each (j, i), the minimal period p is l - π[i-j], where l = i-j+1.

If l mod p ==0, then k_max = l/p.

Else, the minimal cost is 1 + l.

Otherwise, compute the minimal cost over all divisors of k_max.

Now, the code steps:

Read the input string s.

Precompute divisors for all numbers up to 8000.

Precompute for each j, the prefix function array for s[j:].

Precompute the cost for all (j, i) pairs.

Then, use dynamic programming to compute the minimal total cost.

Implementing this in Python.

But for Python, with n=8000, this may be tight in terms of time. But given that the time limit is 2 seconds, and Python can handle around 1e8 operations in that time, this approach should be feasible.

Now, let's think about the code.

First, precompute the divisors:

def precompute_divisors(max_n):
    divisors = [[] for _ in range(max_n +1)]
    for k in range(1, max_n+1):
        for d in range(1, int(k**0.5)+1):
            if k %d ==0:
                divisors[k].append(d)
                if d != k//d:
                    divisors[k].append(k//d)
        divisors[k].sort()
    return divisors

Then, precompute the prefix functions for each j.

For each j, generate the substring s[j:], and compute its prefix function.

But generating the substring each time would be O(n^2) time, but in Python, strings are immutable and slicing is O(k) for a substring of length k. So for j=0 to n-1, the total time would be O(n^2), which is 64 million operations for n=8000. That's manageable.

But perhaps we can compute the prefix functions without generating the substring.

Alternative approach: when processing j, for the substring s[j:], iterate over the characters starting from j. So, for each j, the prefix function is computed as follows:

def compute_prefix_function(s, j):
    n = len(s) - j
    pi = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        k = pi[i-1]
        while k >0 and s[j +i] != s[j +k]:
            k = pi[k-1]
        if s[j +i] == s[j +k]:
            k +=1
        pi[i] = k
    return pi

This way, for each j, we compute the prefix function for s[j:] by adjusting the indices accordingly. This is O(n^2) time, which is acceptable.

Now, precompute all the prefix functions:

n = len(s)
prefix_functions = []
for j in range(n):
    prefix_functions.append(compute_prefix_function(s, j))

Then, for each j and i (i >=j), the minimal period p is (i-j+1) - prefix_functions[j][i-j].

Then, l = i-j+1.

If l %p !=0, cost is 1 + l.

Else, k_max = l//p.

Get all divisors of k_max. For each divisor d, compute the cost len(str(d)) + (l//d).

Find the minimal cost among these, then compare with 1 + l.

But wait, l//d is the base length. So the cost is len(str(d)) + (base length).

But when l is split into d copies of a base of length m = l/d, then d *m = l.

So, for each divisor d of k_max, the base length is l/d.

But k_max = l/p. So l/d = p * (k_max/d) = p * ( (l/p)/d ) = l/(p*d). Wait, no. Because k_max = l/p. So l/d = p * k_max /d.

But this may not be the same as p * (k_max/d).

Wait, l = p *k_max.

So l/d = p *k_max/d.

But k_max/d is an integer since d divides k_max.

So the base length is p * (k_max/d).

But the minimal period p is the minimal possible period for the substring. So for the base length to be p*(k_max/d), which is a multiple of p, the entire substring can be split into d copies of this base.

Thus, the base length is l/d.

But how does this affect the cost? The cost is len(d) + (l/d). Which is len(d) + base length.

But this is correct.

So, the code for the cost for (j, i) is:

l = i -j +1

p = l - prefix_functions[j][i-j]

if l %p !=0:

    cost = 1 + l

else:

    k_max = l //p

    if k_max ==1:

        cost = 1 + l

    else:

        min_cost_div = float('inf')

        for d in divisors[k_max]:

            current_cost = len(str(d)) + (l //d)

            if current_cost < min_cost_div:

                min_cost_div = current_cost

        cost = min(1 + l, min_cost_div)

But wait, the cost when k_max is 1 is 1 + l. But in the code above, if k_max is 1, then the code will enter the else clause, compute k_max=1, then check if k_max ==1. Then, set cost =1 +l.

But in this case, since l is divisible by p (k_max = l/p =1 implies l =p), so l mod p ==0.

But when k_max is 1, the cost would be len(1) + l/1 =1 +l, which is the same as the cost of not splitting. So the code is correct.

Thus, the code for the cost is as follows.

Now, after precomputing all the costs, we can compute the dynamic programming.

Initialize dp as an array of size n+1, where dp[i] is the minimal cost for the first i characters.

dp[0] =0.

For each i from 1 to n:

    dp[i] = min( dp[j] + cost[j][i-1] for j in range(i) )

But in Python, for n=8000, this is O(n^2) time, which is 64 million operations. But with the cost[j][i-1] precomputed, each iteration is O(1), so the loop can be optimized.

But in Python, list comprehensions and loops can be slow for 64 million operations. So we need to optimize this.

Alternative approach: precompute a 2D array of costs, where cost[j][i] is the minimal cost for substring s[j..i]. But for n=8000, this would require a 8000 x 8000 array, which is 64 million entries, which is 64 million * 4 bytes (for integers) is 256MB, which is manageable within the memory constraints.

But in Python, using a list of lists may be memory intensive. So perhaps we can compute the cost on the fly during the DP step.

But precomputing the cost would save time during the DP step. So it's better to precompute the cost.

So, in code:

n = len(s)
cost = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

for j in range(n):
    # compute the prefix function for s[j:]
    pi = compute_prefix_function(s, j)
    for i in range(j, n):
        l = i -j +1
        current_pi = pi[i-j] if i-j < len(pi) else 0
        p = l - current_pi
        if l % p !=0:
            current_cost = 1 + l
        else:
            k_max = l // p
            if k_max ==1:
                current_cost =1 + l
            else:
                min_div_cost = float('inf')
                for d in divisors[k_max]:
                    temp = len(str(d)) + (l //d)
                    if temp < min_div_cost:
                        min_div_cost = temp
                current_cost = min(1 + l, min_div_cost)
        cost[j][i] = current_cost

Then, the DP:

dp = [float('inf')]*(n+1)
dp[0] =0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(i):
        # substring is j to i-1 (0-based)
        current_cost = dp[j] + cost[j][i-1]
        if current_cost < dp[i]:
            dp[i] = current_cost

But for i in 1..n, and j in 0..i-1, this is O(n^2) time.

But with n=8000, this is 64 million iterations. In Python, this can be slow.

But perhaps we can optimize the inner loop using a precomputed minimum. However, I don't see an obvious way to do that.

Alternatively, precompute all the cost[j][i], and then for each i, iterate j from 0 to i-1, and compute the minimal dp[j] + cost[j][i-1].

But this is still O(n^2) time.

Another optimization is to note that the cost[j][i] is not necessarily the same for all j, but for each i, we need to find the j that minimizes dp[j] + cost[j][i-1].

But this is again O(n^2) time.

Given that the time limit is 2 seconds, and Python can handle around 1e8 operations in that time, this code may pass if the operations are optimized.

But for n=8000, 64 million operations in Python is likely to be too slow. So perhaps we need to find a way to optimize the dynamic programming step.

Alternative Idea: For each j, precompute the minimal dp[j] + cost[j][k], for k >=j.

But I don't see a way to do that.

Alternative Idea: Note that for the DP, we are looking for the minimal value of dp[j] + cost[j][i-1] for j from 0 to i-1. For each i, this is the minimal over j <i.

But if we can compute this minimal efficiently, perhaps using some data structure.

But the cost[j][i-1] is not a monotonic function of j, so a sliding window approach may not work.

Another Idea: For each i, the minimal dp[j] + cost[j][i-1] can be found by considering that as j increases, the cost[j][i-1] can vary. But without any pattern, this is hard to optimize.

Thus, the code as outlined is the best possible, but in Python, it's possible that it will not pass the time constraints.

So perhaps, we need to find a way to compute the cost[j][i] on the fly during the DP step, to avoid precomputing a large 2D array.

But this would require recomputing the cost[j][i] for each j and i during the DP step. Which would increase the time complexity.

Thus, perhaps the best way is to proceed with the code as outlined, and hope that Python can handle it within the time constraints.

Another example: "abcab".

The entire string can't be split into any repetitions except 1, so cost is 1+5=6.

So the DP would choose j=0, i=4, cost=6, and thus dp[5]=6.

Third example: "cczabababab".

The best split is "cc" (count 2), "z" (count 1), "abababab" (count4).

The cost for each part:

For "cc" (j=0, i=1): l=2. p=2 - pi[1] (pi for substring "c c" is [0,1]. So p=2-1=1. l%p=0 →k_max=2. Divisors of 2 are 1,2.

d=1: cost 1+2=3.

d=2: cost 1 (len("2") is 1) + 2/2=1 → total 2.

So the minimal is 2. So cost[0][1]=2.

For "z" (j=2, i=2): cost 1+1=2.

For "abababab" (j=3, i=10), l=8. minimal period p=2. k_max=4. Divisors of 4:1,2,4.

For d=4: cost 1+ (8/4)= 1+2=3.

For d=2: cost 1 + 4 →5.

For d=1: cost 9. So minimal is 3. So cost[3][10] =3.

Total cost is 2+2+3=7.

Which matches the third example.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the code:

But in Python, the code may have to be optimized to handle large inputs.

Now, the code.

First, precompute the divisors.

Then, compute the prefix functions for each j.

Then, precompute the cost for all (j, i).

Then, compute the DP.

But for Python, the code needs to be efficient.

Here's the code:

Read s.

Precompute divisors.

Compute prefix functions for each j.

Precompute cost.

Compute DP.

Now, the code.
