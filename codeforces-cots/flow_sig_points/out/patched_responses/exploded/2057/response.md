Okay, let's see. We need to find the maximum number of files that could form both sequences of blocks. The key is that each file's total size must be the same in both messages, and the order of the files must be preserved. But the way the blocks are split can be different between the two messages.

So the problem is essentially to find a common set of prefix sums in both sequences, except that the sum must be the same in both, and these sums form the points where files are split. The maximum number of such points (excluding the total sum) plus one (the number of splits plus one gives the number of files) will be the answer.

Let me think. For example, the first sample:

First message blocks sum to 2+5=7, then 3+1+11=15, then 4+4=8. The second message has 7, then 8+2+4+1=15, then 8. So the common sums are 7, 22 (7+15), and 30 (total). Wait, but the files would be three: the splits are after 7 and after 22. So the total splits (two) plus one equals three files. So the answer is the number of matching partial sums (excluding the total) between the two sequences.

So the approach is to compute the prefix sums for both sequences, then find how many common values they have, excluding the total sum (since the total sum must be the same and is the last element of both prefix sum arrays). Wait, but the total sum is included in the prefix sums. For example, the first sequence's prefix sums would be [2,7,10,11,22,26,30], and the second's [7,15,17,21,22,30]. The common sums are 7,22,30. So the splits are at 7 and 22, giving three files. So the number of common elements between the two prefix sum arrays, excluding the last element (since the total sum is the same and is the last in both), is the count of splits, which plus one gives the number of files.

So the plan is:

1. Compute the prefix sums for both sequences.
2. Find the intersection of these two prefix sum arrays, but exclude the last element (the total sum) from both when checking. Because the last element is the total sum and it's the same in both, but including it would count as a split after the last file, which is not allowed. Wait, the splits are between files. So the files are determined by the points where the prefix sums match. For example, the first file ends at sum S1, the second at S2, etc., up to the total sum S. The number of splits is the number of common sums (excluding S), and the number of files is splits + 1.

So the steps are:

- Compute prefix sums for both sequences, call them A and B.
- The total sum is the last element of both A and B. We know they are equal.
- Find the intersection of all elements in A and B except the last element (the total sum). The size of this intersection is the number of splits. So the answer is that size + 1.

Wait, but how do we compute the intersection? For example, in the first sample, the prefix sums for A are 2,7,10,11,22,26,30. For B, 7,15,17,21,22,30. The common elements are 7,22,30. But 30 is the last element and we need to exclude it. So the intersection excluding 30 would be {7,22}, which has size 2. So the answer is 2 +1 =3. Which matches the sample.

So the algorithm is:

1. Compute the prefix sums for both sequences, A and B.
2. Remove the last element from both A and B (since they are equal and cannot be considered as split points).
3. Find the number of elements common to both modified A and B.
4. The answer is the count of common elements plus 1.

Yes. So the key is to compute the set of prefix sums (excluding the total sum) for both sequences and find the size of their intersection.

Now, the problem is how to compute this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 1e5. So for each sequence, we can compute the prefix sums, then store them in a hash set (for O(1) lookups), then check for each element in one set whether it exists in the other.

But building the prefix sums is O(n) and O(m), which is manageable. Then, creating a set for A (without the last element) and a set for B (without the last element), and then the intersection is the number of elements present in both. The size of the intersection is the count.

Wait, but how to compute the intersection efficiently. Let's see: if we have two sets S and T, the intersection can be found by checking elements of one set against the other. So if one set is smaller, we can iterate through that set and check for presence in the other. But in Python, using a built-in set and the & operator would handle it.

But for n and m up to 1e5, the sets can be up to 1e5 elements each. So the intersection operation is O(min(len(S), len(T))) time.

But what if the sum is up to 1e6 (since the total sum is <=1e6). So each prefix sum is at most 1e6. So the elements are manageable in a hash set.

So the steps for the code:

- Read n and m.
- Read list x, compute prefix sums for x (A). Similarly for y (B).
- Check that the last elements of A and B are equal. (But according to the problem statement, they are guaranteed to be equal.)
- Remove the last elements from both A and B.
- Create sets for A and B.
- Compute the intersection size.
- Output the size +1.

Yes. Let's test this with the examples.

First example:

A (after removing last element) is [2,7,10,11,22,26], B (after removing last element) is [7,15,17,21,22]. The common elements are 7 and 22. So intersection size is 2. Answer is 3.

Second example:

x is [1,10,100], sum is 111. So prefix sums are 1,11,111. Remove last, so [1,11]. y's prefix sums are [1, 101, 111]. Remove last, [1,101]. The intersection is {1}, size 1. Answer 1+1=2.

Third example:

x has prefix sum 4, remove last element (since it's the only one) gives empty set. y's prefix sums after removing last (4) are [1,2,3]. The intersection is empty. So 0 +1=1. Which matches.

So this approach works.

Now, code:

Read n, m.

Read x as a list. Compute prefix sums for x:

current_sum = 0

prefix_x = []
for num in x:
    current_sum += num
    prefix_x.append(current_sum)

Similarly for y.

Then, remove the last element from prefix_x and prefix_y.

Create set_a = set(prefix_x[:-1])

set_b = set(prefix_y[:-1])

common = len(set_a & set_b)

answer is common +1.

Yes.

But need to read the input correctly. Also, note that for the case where the total sum is zero (but according to the input constraints, the sum is at least 1, since each x_i and y_i is at least 1, and sum is the same. So the last element is at least 1. So removing it is safe.

Now, code in Python:

But for handling large n and m, we need to read the input efficiently. So using input().split() and list comprehensions.

For example:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

x = list(map(int, input().split()))
y = list(map(int, input().split()))

Compute prefix sums.

But wait: n is the number of x elements, but in the input, the second line has exactly n numbers. Similarly for m and the third line.

So code:

prefix_x = []
current = 0
for num in x:
    current += num
    prefix_x.append(current)

Same for y.

Then, set_a = set(prefix_x[:-1]) if len(prefix_x) >1 else set()

Wait, if the prefix_x is just one element (n=1), then after removing last element, it's empty. So the set is empty. Similarly for y.

So in code:

set_a = set()
if len(prefix_x) > 1:
    set_a = set(prefix_x[:-1])
else:
    # if len is 1, after removing last, empty.
    pass

Wait, no. For example, when n=1, prefix_x has one element (the sum of x). Then prefix_x[:-1] is empty list. So set_a is empty.

Same for y.

So code can be written as:

a = prefix_x[:-1]
b = prefix_y[:-1]
set_a = set(a)
set_b = set(b)
common = len(set_a & set_b)
print(common +1)

Yes.

This should handle all cases.

Testing the third example:

x is [4], prefix_x is [4]. a = prefix_x[:-1] = empty list. So set_a is empty.

y is [1,1,1,1], prefix_y is [1,2,3,4]. a is [1,2,3]. set_b is {1,2,3}. So common is 0. Answer is 0+1=1.

Yes.

Now, what about when there are no common elements except the total sum? For example, two sequences with sum 5. X has blocks [5], Y has [5]. Then the prefix_x is [5], a is empty. Similarly for Y. So common is zero. Answer is 0+1=1. Which is correct (only one file).

Another case: X's prefix sums (excluding last) is [3, 8], Y's is [3, 8]. Then common is 2. Answer 3.

Yes.

So this approach seems correct.

Now, code.

Now, code:

Read n, m.

Read x and y.

Compute prefix sums.

Take a as prefix_x[:-1], b as prefix_y[:-1].

Compute set_a and set_b.

Find the intersection's size.

Add 1 and print.

Sample3:

1 4 â†’ x is [4], prefix_x is [4], a is empty. y's prefix sums are 1,2,3,4 â†’ b is [1,2,3]. Intersection is empty â†’ 0 +1=1.

All correct.

Now, what about a case where there are overlapping elements but some are duplicates.

For example:

x: [1,1,1], sum is 3. prefix_x is [1,2,3]. a is [1,2].

y: [2,1], sum is 3. prefix_y is [2,3]. a is [2].

set_a is {1,2}, set_b is {2}. Intersection size 1 â†’ answer 2.

Yes.

Another test case where all split points are same:

x: [1,2], y: [3]. So x's sum is 3. prefix_x is [1,3], a is [1]. y's prefix_y is [3], a is empty. So no intersection. Answer 0+1=1. Correct.

So the code handles that.

So this should be correct.
