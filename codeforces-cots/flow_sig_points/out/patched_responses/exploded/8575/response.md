Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the sum of f(p, q) over all possible partitions of the array into two subsequences of length n each. The function f is the sum of absolute differences between the sorted p and the sorted q in reverse order. Hmm.

First, I need to find all possible ways to split the 2n elements into p and q, each of size n. For each such partition, after sorting p in non-decreasing and q in non-increasing order (which effectively sorts them both as non-decreasing and then reverses q?), then sum the absolute differences for each position. Then sum all those values across all possible partitions.

The challenge is that the number of partitions is combinatorial: C(2n, n) which is way too large for n up to 150,000. So brute-forcing is impossible. We need a smart mathematical approach here.

Let me think about the structure of the problem. For each possible partition, after sorting, the contribution for each i is |x_i - y_i|. But since x is sorted in non-decreasing order and y is sorted in non-increasing order (so y is actually sorted in non-decreasing order and then reversed, making it non-increasing), then when both are sorted, the x is sorted up, and y is sorted down. Wait, but when we sort q in non-increasing order, that's equivalent to sorting it in reverse order of non-decreasing. So maybe for each element in the sorted x and sorted y (sorted in non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively), their positions are arranged such that x is in ascending order and y is in descending order. Wait, but when you sort q in non-increasing order, the sorted y would be in descending order. So when both x and y are sorted as per their rules, x is in non-decreasing (so x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ ... ≤ x_n) and y is non-increasing (so y_1 ≥ y_2 ≥ ... ≥ y_n). 

But when we take the sum |x_i - y_i| for each i from 1 to n, how can this sum be calculated over all possible partitions?

The key insight here is that for each position i in the sorted arrays, the contribution |x_i - y_i| might be considered across all possible partitions, but perhaps there's a way to compute the total contribution over all partitions by considering each pair of elements in the original array and their roles in x_i and y_i.

Wait, but the problem is that x and y are sorted, so the order in which elements are arranged in x and y depends on the partition. So perhaps the way to approach this is to first sort the entire array and find some combinatorial properties that allow the sum to be computed efficiently.

Let me try to model this. Let's first sort the entire array. Suppose the array is sorted as a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_2n. Then, for each possible partition into p and q, the sorted x would be some subset of these elements sorted, and the sorted y would be the complement subset sorted in reverse. Wait, but when you sort q in non-increasing order, that's equivalent to sorting the complement subset in non-decreasing order and then reversing it. So y would be sorted in non-increasing order, which is the same as the sorted complement in reverse. So y's sorted array is the sorted complement in reverse. So for x, which is the sorted p, and y, which is the reverse of the sorted q (since q is sorted in non-increasing, which is the same as sorted in non-decreasing and reversed).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to sort the entire array in non-decreasing order. Then, for any partition into p and q, when we sort p in non-decreasing order (x) and sort q in non-increasing order (y), the y array will be the sorted q in reverse. So, for example, if the sorted q is [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n], then y would be [b_n, b_{n-1}, ..., b_1}].

But x is the sorted p. So x is sorted as per non-decreasing, and y is the sorted q in reverse (non-increasing). So for the i-th positions in x and y, x_i is the i-th element of the sorted p, and y_i is the (n - i + 1)-th element of the sorted q. Wait, no. Because when you sort q in non-increasing order, the first element is the largest, the second is next largest, etc. So sorted q in non-increasing is the same as sorted in non-decreasing order and reversed. So for the sorted q (non-increasing), the elements are ordered as q_sorted_desc = [q_sorted_asc[-1], q_sorted_asc[-2], ..., q_sorted_asc[0}].

So, the y array (sorted q in non-increasing) is the reverse of the sorted q in non-decreasing order.

Thus, for each partition, x is sorted p (non-decreasing), y is reverse of sorted q (non-decreasing). So the y array is the reverse of the sorted q in non-decreasing.

But how does this help? The problem requires summing over all partitions the sum of |x_i - y_i| for each i. 

Now, considering all possible partitions, which are C(2n, n) in number. For n=150,000, this is way too big. So we need to find a way to compute the total sum without enumerating all partitions.

Let's think about each position i (from 1 to n) in the x and y arrays. The total contribution to the sum over all partitions is the sum over all partitions of |x_i - y_i|. So the overall answer is the sum over i=1 to n of [sum over all partitions of |x_i in that partition's x and y_i in that partition's y| ].

So if we can compute, for each i, the total contribution across all partitions, then sum those, that would be the answer.

But how to model x_i and y_i for each i?

Hmm. Let's consider the entire array sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's call the sorted array S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_{2n}], where s_1 ≤ s_2 ≤ ... ≤ s_{2n}.

For any partition into p and q, after sorting p and q (and reversing q), x and y are determined. Let's say that in the sorted array S, the elements in p are some subset of size n, and the elements in q are the remaining. Then, x is the sorted p, which would be the elements of p in order s_... sorted, but since S is already sorted, the elements of p in S must be a subset of S. Similarly, q is the complement subset, sorted in non-decreasing order and reversed for y.

Wait, but since S is the sorted array, the sorted p would just be the elements of p in the order they appear in S. For example, if p consists of s_1, s_3, s_5, then x would be [s_1, s_3, s_5], but when sorted, but since S is already sorted, the sorted p is the elements of p in the order they appear in S. Wait, no. Because p is a subset of S. So when we sort p, it's the same as the elements of p sorted, but since S is already sorted, the sorted p is just the elements of p in their positions in S. So for example, if p is the elements at indices i1 < i2 < ... < in in S, then the sorted x is s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{in} in order. But since S is sorted, s_{i1} ≤ s_{i2} ≤ ... ≤ s_{in}.

Similarly, the sorted q in non-decreasing order would be the elements of q in S, which are the complement of p. Then, y is the reverse of that sorted q. So y would be the elements of q sorted in non-decreasing order (so same as their order in S) and then reversed. So y is s_{j_m}, s_{j_{m-1}}, ..., s_{j_1}, where j_1 < j_2 < ... < j_m are the indices of q in S, and m=n.

Wait, but since q has n elements, the sorted q in non-decreasing order is the same as the elements of q in S, in their order. Then, reversing that gives the non-increasing order. So for y, the i-th position in y is the (n - i + 1)-th element in the sorted q (non-decreasing). So for example, in sorted q (non-decreasing), the elements are s_j1, s_j2, ..., s_jn, where j1 < j2 < ... < jn. Then y would be [s_jn, s_jn-1, ..., s_j1}.

So in the x and y arrays, the i-th position in x is the i-th element of the sorted p (which is s_{k_i} where k_i are the indices in S for p, sorted), and the i-th position in y is the (n - i + 1)-th element of the sorted q (which is s_{j_{n - i +1}}}, where j_1 < j_2 < ... < j_n are the indices of q in S).

But the x and y are built from p and q, which are subsets of S. So for each possible subset p of size n (and q the complement), x and y are determined as above.

So the problem reduces to considering all possible subsets p of size n in S (the sorted array), and for each such subset, compute the sum over i of |x_i - y_i|, and then sum all those over all possible subsets.

The question is: How can we compute this sum efficiently?

Let's think about each position i (from 1 to n) in x and y. For each i, the contribution is |x_i - y_i|, and we need to sum this over all possible subsets p. Then sum all these contributions for all i.

But how can we model x_i and y_i for a given subset p?

Wait, since S is sorted, and x is the sorted p (so x_i is the i-th smallest element in p), and y_i is the (n - i +1)-th element of the sorted q (since y is the reversed sorted q). But q is the complement of p, so sorted q is the elements not in p, sorted in increasing order, and reversed to make y.

So for example, for i=1 in x and y:

x_1 is the smallest element in p.

y_1 is the largest element in q (since the sorted q is in increasing order, when reversed, the first element is the largest).

So for each i, x_i is the i-th smallest element in p. y_i is the (n - i +1)-th smallest element in q. Because sorted q is q_sorted = [smallest element in q, next, ..., largest], and y is reversed, so y_i is the (n - i +1)-th element of q_sorted. So for example, when i=1, y_1 is the (n)th element of q_sorted (the largest), and for i=n, y_i is the 1st element of q_sorted (smallest).

So the problem becomes, for each i, across all subsets p of size n, compute the sum of |x_i - y_i|, where x_i is the i-th smallest element in p and y_i is the (n - i +1)-th smallest element in q (since q is the complement of p).

But how can this be computed efficiently?

Perhaps we can model x_i and y_i in terms of the sorted array S. Since S is sorted, the elements in p and q are determined by their positions in S.

Let me think: For a given i, x_i is the i-th element of the subset p (which is a sorted array of size n). Since S is sorted, the elements of p are a subset of n elements in S. Let's arrange S as s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_2n.

The x_i for a subset p would be the element s_k where k is the (i)-th element in the subset p. Similarly, the y_i for that subset is the (n - i +1)-th element in the complement subset q. Since q is the complement of p, and the elements of q are also sorted, the (n - i +1)-th element in q's sorted list is s_j, where j is the (n - i +1)-th element in the sorted q.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model x_i and y_i in terms of the positions in S.

Suppose that in the sorted array S, the subset p consists of positions P = {k_1, k_2, ..., k_n}, where k_1 < k_2 < ... <k_n. Then x_i is s_{k_i}.

The subset q is the complement, so q's sorted list is the elements not in P, sorted in S. So the elements of q are s_{m_1}, s_{m_2}, ..., s_{m_n}, where m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n. The y array is the reverse of this, so y_i is s_{m_{n - i +1}}.

So for each i, x_i is s_{k_i} and y_i is s_{m_{n - i +1}}.

Thus, the contribution for this subset is sum_{i=1 to n} |s_{k_i} - s_{m_{n - i +1}}}|.

But how can this sum be computed over all possible subsets P?

This seems challenging. Let's try to think of each term |s_{k_i} - s_{m_{n - i +1}}}| for a fixed i, and see if there's a pattern.

Wait, note that m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, and since m's are the complement of k's, the union of k's and m's is all 2n elements. So for any j, m_j is the j-th element not in P.

Now, let's look at the i-th term: for each subset P, the term is |s_{k_i} - s_{m_{n - i +1}}}|.

But perhaps m_{n -i +1} can be expressed in terms of the complement. For example, m is the list of elements not in P, sorted. So if the entire array is sorted, then for any P (subset of size n), the elements of q (complement of P) are the ones not in P. So m_1 is the smallest element in q, m_2 the next, etc.

But what is the relationship between k_i and m_{n -i +1}? Let's consider that when P is selected as a subset of size n, the elements in q are S's elements not in P. Let's think for a particular i. For example, when i=1, the term is |s_{k_1} - s_{m_n}|. But m_n is the largest element in q, which is the largest element not in P. Similarly, for i=2, it's |s_{k_2} - s_{m_{n-1}}}|, and m_{n-1} is the second largest in q.

So for each i, the term is |s_{k_i} (the i-th smallest element in P) - s_{m_{n -i +1}} (the (n -i +1)-th smallest element in q) |. But wait, the (n -i +1)-th smallest in q is the same as the (n -i +1)-th element in q's sorted list. But since q's sorted list is m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n, m_{n -i +1} is the (n -i +1)-th element in that list. So when i=1, it's m_n (the largest in q), for i=2, m_{n-1} (second largest), etc.

Hmm. So for each term in the sum, x_i is the i-th element of P (sorted), and y_i is the (n -i +1)-th element of q (sorted). So for each i, x_i and y_i are the i-th element of P and the (n -i +1)-th element of q. But how can this be rephrased in terms of the entire sorted array S?

Let's consider that the entire array is sorted. For any i, the i-th term in the sum depends on the i-th element of P and the (n -i +1)-th element of q.

But since the entire array is sorted, perhaps the sum can be broken down by considering pairs of elements (a, b) where a is in P, b is in q, and their positions in S relate to i. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible pair (s_j, s_k), where j < k, we can compute how many times |s_j - s_k| contributes to the sum. Wait, but in which term and for which i?

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (s_a, s_b) in the sorted array will contribute to exactly one term in exactly some of the subsets. So for each pair (a, b), we can determine how many subsets P have x_i = s_a and y_i = s_b for some i, and multiply by |s_a - s_b|, then sum over all a and b.

But this seems complicated. Let's think for a specific i. Let's focus on the i-th term in the sum. For that term, the contribution across all subsets is the sum over all possible P where x_i = s_a and y_i = s_b, multiplied by |s_a - s_b|. So for each i, the total contribution is the sum over a and b of (number of subsets P where x_i = s_a and y_i = s_b) multiplied by |s_a - s_b|.

But how do we compute the number of such subsets for each i, a, and b?

Let's fix i. For the i-th term, x_i is the i-th element of P. Since P is a subset of size n, the i-th element in P (sorted) is s_j, which implies that there are exactly (i-1) elements in P that are <= s_j and (n - i) elements in P that are >= s_j. Similarly, y_i is the (n -i +1)-th element of q's sorted list, which is the (n -i +1)-th smallest element in q. So for q, since it's the complement of P, the (n -i +1)-th element is s_k. The complement of P must have (n -i) elements <= s_k and (i -1) elements >= s_k.

Wait, perhaps this can be modeled as follows: For fixed i, x_i is s_j and y_i is s_k. Then in the sorted array S, j must be in P, and k must be in q. So j < k (since s_j <= s_k, but since S is sorted, if j and k are in the same subset, their positions are determined). Wait, no. Because j and k are positions in S. If j is in P (the i-th element of P), and k is in q (the (n -i +1)-th element of q), then j must be in P and k must be in q. So j and k must be distinct, and j < k is possible, but j can be any element in P, and k any in q.

But for x_i to be s_j, j must be the i-th element of P. Similarly, for y_i to be s_k, k must be the (n -i +1)-th element of q. So for each i, the pair (j, k) must satisfy that in the subset P, there are exactly (i-1) elements in P that are <= s_j, and (n -i) elements in P that are >= s_j. Similarly, in the subset q (complement of P), there are exactly (n -i +1 -1) elements in q that are <= s_k (since k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q's sorted list). So for q, the (n -i +1)-th element is s_k, which implies that there are (n -i +1 -1) elements in q that are <= s_k and (i-1) elements >= s_k.

But how can this be translated into constraints on j and k?

Alternatively, for x_i = s_j and y_i = s_k, the conditions are:

In the sorted array S:

- The subset P must contain j as its i-th element. So, there are exactly (i-1) elements in P that are <= j (i.e., elements from the first j-1 positions in S, since S is sorted), and exactly (n -i) elements in P that are >= j (elements from j+1 to 2n).

Similarly, for y_i = s_k to be the (n -i +1)-th element of q's sorted list:

- The subset q (complement of P) must contain k as its (n -i +1)-th element. So, in q, there are (n -i +1 -1) elements <= k (i.e., elements in q from positions 1 to k-1 in S) and (i-1) elements >= k (elements from k+1 to 2n in S).

But wait, since P and q are complements, the elements in q are exactly those not in P. So for the subset P, the elements not in P are in q.

So combining these conditions:

For the subset P to have x_i = s_j and y_i = s_k, the following must be true:

1. j is in P, and in P's sorted list, it's the i-th element. This means that among all elements in P, there are exactly i-1 elements before j (in S) and n -i elements after j (in S). So in the sorted array S, the number of elements in P that are <= s_j (i.e., elements from S[1..j]) is i. Because j is the i-th element in P's sorted list. So in P, there are exactly i elements in S[1..j], and (n -i) elements in S[j+1..2n].

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that for j to be the i-th element of P's sorted list, then exactly (i-1) elements of P are in S[1..j-1], and the element j is in P, and (n -i) elements are in S[j+1..2n].

Similarly, for k to be the (n -i +1)-th element of q's sorted list, there must be exactly (n -i) elements in q in S[1..k-1], and (i-1) elements in q in S[k+1..2n].

But since q is the complement of P, the elements in q are the ones not in P. So the elements in q that are <= s_k are the elements in S[1..k] that are not in P.

Similarly, for q's (n -i +1)-th element to be k, there must be exactly (n -i +1) elements in q that are <= s_k (including k itself). So in S[1..k], the number of elements not in P is (n -i +1). But since P's elements in S[1..j] are (i-1) elements (from the x_i condition), perhaps there's a way to model this.

Wait, this is getting really complicated. Let's try to model this step by step.

For a fixed i, j, and k:

Conditions for x_i = s_j and y_i = s_k:

1. j is in P (subset size n), and in P's sorted list, there are exactly (i-1) elements before j (so in S[1..j-1], there are (i-1) elements in P), and (n -i) elements in P in S[j+1..2n].

2. k is in q (so not in P), and in q's sorted list, there are exactly (n -i) elements before k (so in S[1..k-1], there are (n -i) elements in q), and (i-1) elements in q in S[k+1..2n].

But since q is the complement of P, the elements in q are those not in P.

So for condition 1:

- The number of elements in P from S[1..j-1] is (i-1).
- The number of elements in P from S[j+1..2n] is (n -i).
- So the total elements in P from S[1..j-1], j, and S[j+1..2n] is (i-1) + 1 + (n -i) = n elements. Which checks out.

For condition 2:

- The number of elements in q (complement of P) from S[1..k-1] is (n -i).

- The number of elements in q from S[k+1..2n] is (i-1).

- So the total elements in q from S[1..k-1], k, and S[k+1..2n] is (n -i) + 0 (since k is in q) + (i-1) + 1 (k itself) = (n -i) + (i-1) +1 = n. Which also checks out.

But there's more constraints here. Because q is the complement of P, the elements in q from S[1..k-1] are the elements in S[1..k-1] not in P. The count of elements in q in S[1..k-1] is equal to the count of elements in S[1..k-1] minus the count of elements in P in S[1..k-1].

But according to condition 1, the count of elements in P in S[1..j-1] is (i-1). But if j < k, then S[1..k-1] includes S[1..j-1], and perhaps j and other elements up to k-1.

Alternatively, perhaps j and k must satisfy some relationship for the conditions to be possible. For example, the elements in S[1..j-1] contribute to the count in condition 1, and elements in S[1..k-1] contribute to condition 2.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model j and k such that these conditions are met.

Alternatively, maybe j and k are related in a way that j <= k, or k <= j. Let's see.

Suppose j > k. Then, s_j >= s_k. Then, when x_i = s_j and y_i = s_k, the term is |s_j - s_k| = s_j - s_k. But j is in P and k is in q. But since j >k (i.e., s_j >= s_k), then j is to the right of k in the sorted array.

But in condition 1, the elements of P in S[1..j-1] are (i-1). Since k < j, S[1..j-1] includes k. So how many elements of P are in S[1..j-1]? (i-1). So elements in q in S[1..k-1] are (k-1 elements in total) minus (elements of P in S[1..k-1]). But elements of P in S[1..k-1] is a subset of the elements in S[1..j-1], since k <j.

But according to condition 2, the number of elements in q in S[1..k-1] is (n -i). But since q's elements are the complement of P, the elements in q in S[1..k-1] is (k-1 - (number of elements in P in S[1..k-1})). According to condition 1, the number of elements in P in S[1..j-1] is (i-1). So the number of elements in P in S[1..k-1] is some number between 0 and i-1, depending on where k is relative to j.

This seems too vague. Let's think of a different approach. Perhaps the key is to find, for each position i, the sum over all possible pairs (j, k) of s_j and s_k, multiplied by the number of subsets P where in P, j is the i-th element, and in q, k is the (n -i +1)-th element. Then multiply by |s_j - s_k| and sum over all j and k.

But how to compute the count of subsets P for which these conditions hold?

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, the pair (j, k) must satisfy certain constraints, and the count is the number of ways to choose the rest of the elements in P and q such that conditions 1 and 2 are met.

Let's try to model this.

For a given i, j, and k, the count of subsets P where:

- j is in P.

- There are exactly (i-1) elements in P from S[1..j-1].

- There are exactly (n -i) elements in P from S[j+1..2n].

- k is in q (so not in P).

- There are exactly (n -i) elements in q from S[1..k-1].

- There are exactly (i-1) elements in q from S[k+1..2n].

But how can these conditions be combined?

Since q is the complement of P, the elements in q from S[1..k-1] is (number of elements in S[1..k-1] that are not in P). Which is (k-1) minus the number of elements in P in S[1..k-1].

But according to condition 1, the number of elements in P in S[1..j-1] is (i-1). So if j <k, then S[1..j-1] is a subset of S[1..k-1]. So the elements in P in S[1..k-1] would be (i-1) plus the elements in P in S[j..k-1].

But this complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps for j and k to be part of such a pair, the positions j and k must be such that j is the i-th element in P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element in q. But given the sorted nature, perhaps j and k must be separated by a certain number of elements.

This feels like it's getting stuck. Let's think of another angle.

Perhaps for each element in S, we can compute how many times it appears as x_i in some subset P, and how many times another element appears as y_i in q, and their pairwise contributions.

Alternatively, note that for each i, the i-th term in the sum is |x_i - y_i|. Let's imagine that for the entire array sorted, the sum over all partitions can be expressed in terms of the combination of pairs of elements from S. For example, for each i, the sum is the sum over all possible pairs (a, b) where a is the i-th element of P and b is the (n -i +1)-th element of q, multiplied by |a - b| and the number of subsets P where this occurs.

So for each i, the problem reduces to finding all possible pairs (a, b) where a is in P and b is in q, and a is the i-th element of P, and b is the (n -i +1)-th element of q. Then for each such pair, compute the number of subsets P where this happens, multiply by |a - b|, and sum for all i.

So for each i, we can compute the total contribution for that i as sum_{j, k} |s_j - s_k| * C, where C is the number of subsets P where j is the i-th element of P, and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q (complement of P).

But how can C be computed?

Let's try to model C for a fixed i, j, k.

First, j must be in P, and k must be in q. So j and k are distinct.

Next, for j to be the i-th element of P:

- There are exactly (i-1) elements in P in S[1..j-1].

- The remaining (n -i) elements in P are in S[j+1..2n].

For k to be the (n -i +1)-th element of q:

- There are exactly (n -i) elements in q in S[1..k-1].

- The remaining (i-1) elements in q are in S[k+1..2n].

But since q is the complement of P, the elements in q are not in P.

So, combining these conditions:

The elements in P are:

- Exactly (i-1) elements from S[1..j-1].

- The element j.

- Exactly (n -i) elements from S[j+1..2n].

The elements not in P (q) are:

- The elements not in S[1..j-1] (i.e., elements from j to 2n) except those selected in P.

But also, the elements in q must satisfy that there are (n -i) elements in q from S[1..k-1], and (i-1) elements in q from S[k+1..2n].

Wait, but q is the complement of P, so the elements in q are:

- All elements not in P. So from S[1..j-1], the elements not in P are ( (j-1) - (i-1) ) = (j - i) elements.

From S[j+1..2n], the elements not in P are ( (2n - j) - (n -i) ) = (2n -j -n +i) = (n -j +i) elements.

But for q to have exactly (n -i) elements from S[1..k-1], that means the number of elements in q (complement of P) from S[1..k-1] must be (n -i).

But the elements in q from S[1..k-1] are:

- Elements from S[1..k-1] not in P.

Which is:

If k-1 <= j-1: then the elements in S[1..k-1] not in P are (k-1) - (number of P elements in S[1..k-1]). Since the number of P elements in S[1..j-1] is (i-1), and k-1 <= j-1, then the number of P elements in S[1..k-1] is some number between 0 and i-1. But this is not necessarily fixed unless k and j are related.

Alternatively, perhaps j must be <= k for this to be possible. Because the elements in q's S[1..k-1] are part of S[1..k-1], which includes elements up to k-1, and j could be in this range or not.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Another approach: let's consider that for the i-th term, the x_i and y_i must come from a certain pair of positions in the sorted array. For example, when the entire array is sorted, x_i is the j-th element in the sorted array, and y_i is the (2n - i +1 - (i-1))th element? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for each i, x_i and y_i must come from a certain pair of elements in the sorted array, such that their positions are related.

Wait, let's take the first example. The input is [1,4], sorted as [1,4]. n=1. So possible partitions are p=[1], q=[4], and vice versa. For i=1, x_1 is 1, y_1 is4 in the first case, giving |1-4|=3. In the second case, x_1 is4, y_1 is1, giving |4-1|=3. Total sum 6.

In this case, for i=1, j can be 1 or 2 (positions in S). For each j, k must be 2 or 1, respectively.

But how are j and k related here?

In the first case, j=1 (x_i=1), and k=2 (y_i=4, which is the (n -i +1)th element of q. Since n=1 and i=1, (n -i +1) =1. So q's sorted list is [4], and the first element is4.

So for j=1 and k=2: how many subsets P have j in P and k in q, and the required counts?

In the first example, P must contain j=1, have (i-1)=0 elements before it. So P has 0 elements from S[1..0] (nothing), and (n-i)=0 elements from S[2..2]. So P is {1}.

Then q is {4}, which has (n-i) =0 elements from S[1..k-1] (k=2, so S[1..1]=1. So q has 0 elements from S[1..1], which is correct as q has 4. But according to condition 2 for y_i: the number of elements in q from S[1..k-1] (k=2, S[1..1]) is (0), which must equal (n -i) =0. So this is valid.

The other case is j=2 (x_i=4), and k=1 (y_i=1). Then P contains j=2, with (i-1)=0 elements from S[1..1] (so P cannot include 1). So P is {4}, q is {1}. For condition 2, k=1: elements in q from S[1..0] (which is none) must be (n -i)=0. Which is valid.

So the count for each pair (j=1, k=2) and (j=2, k=1) is 1.

Thus, the total contribution for i=1 is (1 * 3) + (1 *3) =6.

So this works for the first example.

Now, the problem is to find for each i, the sum over all j and k of |s_j -s_k| multiplied by the number of subsets P where j is the i-th element of P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q.

But how to model this for large n?

Let's think of the sorted array S. For each i, we can think of the i-th element of P as s_j, and the (n-i+1)-th element of q as s_k. We need to find the number of subsets where j is in P, k is in q, and the required count of elements in P and q.

But perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think of all possible pairs (j, k) where j < k. For each such pair, in how many subsets P are they contributing to the i-th term?

Alternatively, perhaps for each pair (j, k), where j and k are positions in S with j <k, the term |s_j -s_k| contributes to the i-th term in some number of subsets. Let's try to model this.

For a pair (j, k) with j <k:

If j is in P and k is in q, then x_i is s_j and y_i is s_k. So the contribution is s_k - s_j.

Alternatively, if k is in P and j is in q, then x_i is s_k and y_i is s_j, so the contribution is s_k - s_j again. Wait, no. Because if j is in q, then y_i would be s_j only if j is the (n -i +1)-th element of q's sorted list. So for this to happen, j must be in q, and in the (n -i +1)th position of q's sorted list.

So for a pair (j, k) where j <k, how many times does the pair contribute to the sum for a particular i? It depends on whether j is the i-th element of P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q, or vice versa.

But this seems difficult. Let's think for each i, how the pairs contribute.

But perhaps the following is true: the sum for each i is the sum over all pairs (j, k) where j is the i-th element of P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q, multiplied by |s_j - s_k| and the number of such subsets P.

So the total sum is the sum over i from 1 to n of the sum over all j and k of (number of subsets P where j is the i-th element of P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of q) multiplied by |s_j - s_k|.

But how can we compute this number of subsets P for each (i, j, k)?

Let's consider that for a given i, j, and k, the number of subsets P is determined by the number of ways to choose the elements of P such that:

1. j is in P.

2. Exactly i-1 elements are chosen from S[1..j-1].

3. Exactly n-i elements are chosen from S[j+1..2n].

4. k is not in P (since k is in q).

5. Among the elements not in P (q), the element k is the (n -i +1)-th in q's sorted list.

Condition 5 implies that in q, there are exactly (n -i) elements in S[1..k-1] and (i-1) elements in S[k+1..2n].

But since q is the complement of P, the elements in q are:

- All elements not in P.

So the elements in q in S[1..k-1] are the elements in S[1..k-1] that are not in P.

The number of such elements is (k-1 - number of elements in P in S[1..k-1]).

According to condition 2, the number of elements in P in S[1..j-1] is i-1.

So, if j <=k-1, then S[1..j-1] is a subset of S[1..k-1]. The number of elements in P in S[1..k-1] is (i-1) plus the number of elements in P in S[j..k-1].

But this complicates things. However, perhaps there's a way to model the required constraints.

Alternatively, suppose that j and k are such that j <=k. Let's assume j <=k for now. Then, for j to be in P and k to be in q, the following must be true:

The number of elements in q in S[1..k-1] must be (n -i). But these elements are S[1..k-1] not in P. The number of such elements is (k-1) - (number of elements in P in S[1..k-1}).

But according to condition 2, the number of elements in P in S[1..j-1} is (i-1). So if j <=k-1, then the elements in P between j and k-1 would be part of the count in S[1..k-1}.

But this is getting too tangled. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Another idea: for each i, the i-th term in the sum can be computed based on the sorted array. Let's sort the array S in non-decreasing order. Then, for each i, the total contribution is sum_{j=1 to 2n} sum_{k=1 to 2n} |s_j - s_k| * C(i, j, k), where C(i, j, k) is the number of subsets P where j is the i-th element in P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element in q.

But how to compute C(i, j, k)?

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, the C(i, j, k) can be computed as the product of:

- The number of ways to choose (i-1) elements from the first (j-1) elements of S for P.

- The number of ways to choose (n -i) elements from the elements after j in S for P.

- The number of ways to choose (n -i) elements from the first (k-1) elements of S (excluding j) for q.

- The number of ways to choose (i-1) elements from the elements after k in S (excluding j) for q.

But this seems incorrect because P and q are complements. So once P is chosen, q is determined.

Wait, but perhaps the conditions are:

To have j in P and k in q, and the required counts for elements around j and k.

So, the steps to choose P are:

1. Include j in P.

2. Choose (i-1) elements from S[1..j-1] for P.

3. Choose (n -i) elements from S[j+1..2n] for P.

4. Exclude k from P (k is in q).

5. In q (the complement of P), there must be exactly (n -i) elements from S[1..k-1] and (i-1) elements from S[k+1..2n].

But since q is the complement of P, the elements in q from S[1..k-1] are (number of elements in S[1..k-1] not in P). Which is (k-1 - (number of elements in P in S[1..k-1})).

According to condition 2, the number of elements in P in S[1..j-1} is (i-1). But if k is in q, then j and k can be in any position, but j must be in P, and k must be in q.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the key insight is that for each i, the optimal way to compute the sum is to pair the i-th smallest element in P with the i-th largest element in q. But how?

Alternatively, after sorting the entire array, perhaps the answer can be computed by considering the pairs (s_{i}, s_{2n -i +1}) for each i from 1 to n. But why?

For example, in the first sample, the sorted array is [1,4]. For i=1, the pair is (1,4). For each possible partition, one of the two possible pairs is selected, and each contributes 3. So the sum is 6.

In the second sample, the sorted array is [1,1,2,2]. For i=1 and 2. Let's see:

For i=1, the contribution would be pairs between the first element of P and the third element of q. Or wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the total sum is the sum over all possible pairs (s_j, s_k) where j and k are in certain positions, and each pair is multiplied by the number of subsets where j is in P and k is in q, and their respective positions in P and q contribute to the sum.

But how?

Another approach: Let's consider that for any subset P, the sum of |x_i - y_i| for all i is equal to the sum of |x_i - y_i| for each i, which depends on the sorted P and sorted q (reversed).

But since the sum is additive over i, perhaps for each i, we can compute the contribution of all pairs (x_i, y_i) across all subsets.

Now, the key insight is that for each i, the contribution is the sum over all possible pairs (a, b) where a is the i-th element in P and b is the (n -i +1)-th element in q. The number of subsets P where this occurs is the binomial coefficient C(j-1, i-1) * C(2n -j, n -i) * C(k-1 - (j >k ? ... )), but this seems stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, the sum over all possible pairs (j, j) is zero, but that's not helpful.

Another idea: After sorting the array S, for each i, the contribution to the total sum is the sum over all pairs of elements (s_{i + t}, s_{2n -i +1 -t}) for some t. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the second sample:

Input is [2,1,2,1], sorted as [1,1,2,2]. n=2. The answer is 12.

The valid partitions are 6. For each, the sum of |x_i - y_i| is computed. For example, one partition is p=[1,1], q=[2,2]. sorted p is [1,1], sorted q is [2,2], reversed to [2,2]. So sum is |1-2| + |1-2| = 1+1=2. This contributes 2 to the total sum. Another partition is p=[1,2], q=[1,2]. sorted p is [1,2], q sorted in non-increasing is [2,1]. sum is |1-2| + |2-1|=1+1=2. Etc. The total sum over all 6 partitions is 12.

Looking at the sorted array [1,1,2,2], perhaps for each i (i=1 and 2), the contribution is computed as follows:

For i=1, the pairs are (s_1, s_4), (s_2, s_3), etc. But the actual pairs contributing depend on the subsets chosen.

But how can this be generalized?

Alternative Idea:

The problem can be transformed into the following: For each possible subset P of size n, compute the sum of |x_i - y_i| for all i, where x is sorted P and y is sorted Q (Q is the complement) in non-increasing order. Sum this over all subsets P.

But the sum can be rewritten as the sum over all pairs (i, j) of elements in P and Q such that i is in the i-th position of x and j is in the (n -i +1)-th position of y.

But since each pair (i, j) in this way contributes exactly once per subset P where this pairing occurs, the total sum is the sum over all possible pairs (a, b) of elements, multiplied by the number of subsets P where a is the i-th element of x and b is the (n -i +1)-th element of y for some i.

But this seems like a dead end.

Another Idea: Let's sort the array S. For each element in S, we can compute how many times it appears as x_i in any subset P, and how many times it appears as y_i in any subset Q. Then, the total sum would be the sum over all pairs (a, b) of (count of (a in x_i and b in y_i) * |a - b|) for all i.

But this is still not straightforward.

Alternative Approach: Let's consider the entire array sorted. Let's imagine that for each i, the optimal way to compute the contribution is to pair the i-th smallest element in P with the i-th largest element in Q. But since all possible subsets are considered, perhaps for each position i in the sorted array, there's a certain probability that an element s_j appears in x_i or y_i across all possible subsets, and the total contribution can be computed based on these probabilities multiplied by the number of subsets.

Wait, but how?

For example, for each element s_j in the sorted array, what is the number of subsets where s_j appears as x_i (the i-th element of P) multiplied by the number of possible y_i elements from Q. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, for each j, compute the number of subsets where s_j is in P and is the i-th element. Let this count be C(j, i). Similarly, for each k, compute the number of subsets where s_k is in Q and is the (n -i +1)-th element. Let this count be D(k, i). Then, for each i, the total contribution is sum_{j, k} |s_j - s_k| * C(j, i) * D(k, i).

But this is only valid if the events are independent, which they are not. Because if j is in P, then k must be in Q. So the correct way would be to compute for each i, sum_{j < k} (C(j, i, k) * (s_k - s_j) + C(k, i, j) * (s_k - s_j)), where C(j, i, k) is the number of subsets where j is the i-th element of P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element of Q.

But this may not capture all cases, but it's an idea.

But how to compute C(j, i, k)?

This seems challenging. Let's think of the sorted array S.

For j to be the i-th element of P, the number of subsets where this happens is C(j-1 choose i-1) * C(2n - j choose n -i). Because you choose i-1 elements from the first j-1 elements, and n-i elements from the elements after j.

But this assumes that j is in P. Now, for k to be the (n -i +1)-th element of Q, which is the (n -i +1)-th element in the sorted Q (non-decreasing). But since Q is the complement of P, the sorted Q's elements are the elements not in P, sorted in non-decreasing order, then reversed.

So the (n -i +1)-th element in the sorted Q is the (i-th) element in the original sorted list of Q. Wait, no. Because the sorted Q is in non-increasing order. So y_i is the i-th element of the sorted Q in non-increasing order, which is the same as the (n -i +1)-th element of the sorted Q in non-decreasing order.

Wait, let's clarify. The sorted Q in non-increasing order is the reverse of the sorted Q in non-decreasing order. So, for example, if the sorted Q in non-decreasing order is [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4], then the sorted Q in non-increasing order is [s_4, s_3, s_2, s_1}. So the i-th element in the non-increasing sorted Q is the (n -i +1)-th element in the non-decreasing sorted Q.

So for the (n -i +1)-th element in the non-decreasing sorted Q, which is s_k, the i-th element in the non-increasing sorted Q is s_k.

But how to model the number of subsets where k is in Q and is the (n -i +1)-th element in the non-decreasing sorted Q.

Wait, but this is equivalent to k being the (i-th) element in the non-increasing sorted Q, which is the same as the (n -i +1)-th element in the non-decreasing sorted Q.

So for k to be the (n -i +1)-th element in the non-decreasing sorted Q, it must have exactly (n -i) elements in Q that are <= k and (i-1) elements in Q that are >= k.

But since Q is the complement of P, the elements in Q that are <= k are those in S[1..k] not in P. So the number of elements in Q that are <=k is (k) - (number of elements in P in S[1..k}).

But this number must equal (n -i). So:

(k) - (number of elements in P in S[1..k}) ) = n -i.

But the number of elements in P in S[1..k} is equal to the number of elements in P from S[1..k}.

But since j is in P, and j is the i-th element of P, then the number of elements in P from S[1..j} is i (since j is the i-th element). But if k >= j, then the elements in P from S[1..k} are i plus the elements in P from S[j+1..k}].

This is again getting stuck.

An alternative idea inspired by the examples: perhaps the answer can be computed as the sum over all pairs of elements (a, b) in the array, multiplied by the number of subsets P where a is in P, b is in Q, and a and b are in certain positions in their respective sorted arrays. The coefficient for each pair (a, b) is the number of times they contribute to the sum.

But how?

For a pair (a, b), where a < b:

In a subset P where a is in P and b is in Q, if in the sorted P and sorted Q (reversed), a is the i-th element of P and b is the i-th element of Q's sorted list (reversed), then the contribution is (b - a). This can happen for some i. The same pair can contribute for different i's.

But how to find for each pair (a, b) the number of subsets P where a is the i-th element of P and b is the (n -i +1)-th element of Q's sorted list (non-decreasing) for some i.

Alternatively, perhaps for each pair of elements a and b (sorted as a <= b), the contribution to the total sum is (b - a) multiplied by the number of subsets P where a is in P, b is in Q, and there are exactly (i-1) elements in P before a, and exactly (n -i) elements in P after a, and in Q, there are exactly (n -i) elements before b and (i-1) elements after b. For each i.

But this seems similar to previous attempts.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to sort the array and compute for each i the sum of s_{n+i} - s_i for all possible subsets. But how?

Another Idea:

After sorting the array, the optimal way to maximize the contribution is to pair the i-th element of the first half with the i-th element of the second half. Because when you choose the first n elements as P and the next n as Q, the contributions would be s_{n+i} - s_i for each i. But since all possible subsets are considered, maybe the answer is the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(2n choose n-1) or similar.

Wait, let's look at the first example: sorted array [1,4]. n=1. The sum is (4-1)*2 =6. The binomial coefficient here is C(0,0)*C(0,0) * 2 = 2, which is the number of subsets.

In the second example: sorted [1,1,2,2]. n=2. The pairs would be (1,2) and (1,2), contributing (2-1)+(2-1) =2 per partition. But there are 6 partitions. So 6 *2=12. Which matches the example.

Wait, this suggests that for each i from 1 to n, the contribution is (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(2n choose n) / n. But how?

Wait, in the second example, each pair (1,2) contributes 1 for each of the two possible positions (i=1 and i=2?), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after sorting the array, the answer is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n +i} - s_i) multiplied by C(2n-2, n-1), because for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the number of subsets where s_i is in P and s_{n+i} is in Q is C(2n-2, n-1). Because you have to choose n-1 elements from the remaining 2n-2 elements.

But in the first example, 2n=2, n=1. So the number of subsets where 1 is in P and 4 in Q is 1 (the subset {1}), and vice versa (subset {4}), totaling 2, which is C(0,0) for each. But 2 is 2*1, which is C(0,0) * 2.

Wait, if each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}) contributes (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by C(2n-2 choose n-1), then for the first example:

C(0, 0) is 1. The pair is (1,4), so contribution is (4-1)*1*2=6. Because there are two pairs: (1 in P, 4 in Q) and (4 in P, 1 in Q). But the binomial coefficient for each would be 1, so total 2*1*3=6.

In the second example, pairs are (1,2) and (1,2). Each pair contributes (2-1) * C(2*2-2=2 choose 2-1=1) =1 * 2=2. There are two pairs, so total 2*2=4. But the answer is 12. So this approach doesn't fit.

Hmm. So this suggests that the binomial coefficient is not C(2n-2, n-1), but something else.

Wait, let's think again. For each pair (s_i, s_j), i < j, the number of subsets P where s_i is in P and s_j is in Q is C(2n-2, n-1). Because you have to choose n-1 elements from the remaining 2n-2 elements (excluding i and j) to add to P (which already contains i). So the total number is C(2n-2, n-1). Similarly, for the pair (s_j, s_i), where j is in P and i is in Q, it's another C(2n-2, n-1). So each pair (i, j) contributes 2 * C(2n-2, n-1) * (s_j - s_i) if i <j.

If this is the case, then the total sum would be the sum over all pairs (i, j) with i <j of 2 * C(2n-2, n-1) * (s_j - s_i).

But this can't be right because for the first example, the sum would be 2 * C(0,0) * (4-1) = 6, which matches. For the second example, the sorted array is [1,1,2,2]. The pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (1,2), (1,2), (1,2), (2,2). The pairs where i<j and s_i < s_j are the pairs (1,2), (1,2), (1,2), (1,2). Each contributes 2 * C(2,1) * (2-1) = 2*2*1=4 per pair. There are four such pairs, so total 4*4=16. But the correct answer is 12, so this approach is wrong.

This suggests that the previous assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps each term (s_j - s_i) is multiplied by some binomial coefficient based on the positions of i and j.

Another Idea:

The key insight is that for each i, the sum of |x_i - y_i| over all possible subsets P is equal to the sum over all possible pairs (s_j, s_k) of the number of subsets where j is the i-th element in P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element in Q. Each such pair contributes |s_j - s_k| multiplied by the number of such subsets.

If we can find for each i, the sum of (s_k - s_j) multiplied by the number of subsets where j is the i-th element in P and k is the (n -i +1)-th element in Q, and j <k, then the total sum would be the sum of these for all i.

But how to compute this for large n?

Let's consider that after sorting the array S, for each i, the i-th term in the sum is determined by the pair (s_{i}, s_{2n -i +1}). For example, in the first sample, i=1, s_1=1, s_2=4. The contribution is (4-1)*2=6.

In the third sample, all elements are the same, so all contributions are zero. Which fits.

In the second sample, after sorting [1,1,2,2], for i=1, the pair is (s_1=1, s_4=2). For i=2, the pair is (s_2=1, s_3=2). The contributions would be (2-1) * C(2, 1) * C(2, 1) * 2 (for each i), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, the contribution is (s_{n +i} - s_i) multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(2n choose n) divided by 2. But this is not clear.

Another Idea:

The sum over all partitions is equal to the sum of |x_i - y_i| for each partition, summed over all partitions. But since each partition is a subset P of size n, and the complementary subset Q, we can pair each subset P with its complement Q. But since Q is the complement of P, the roles of P and Q are swapped. So for each subset P, there's a corresponding subset Q which is the complement. This means that the function f(P, Q) and f(Q, P) are both considered. For each such pair, the sum of their contributions is |x_i - y_i| + |y_i - x_i| for each i. But since absolute value is symmetric, this is 2 * |x_i - y_i| if x_i != y_i, but 0 if x_i = y_i.

But this suggests that the total sum is twice the sum over all subsets P (considered once) of the sum of (x_i - y_i) when x_i > y_i. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of subsets P and Q contributes twice, but this is not the case because each partition is considered once. So this line of thought may not help.

Another Idea inspired by the examples:

If the array is sorted, then for each i, the i-th element in P and the i-th element in Q (after reversing) will have a certain relation. Perhaps the optimal way is to pair the i-th element in the sorted array with the (2n -i +1)-th element. For example, in the first sample, 1 and 4 are paired. In the second sample, after sorting [1,1,2,2], for i=1, the pair is (1,2), and for i=2, the pair is (1,2). So for each i, it's s_{i} and s_{2n -i +1} which are paired.

If this is the case, then the total contribution would be sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{2n -i +1} - s_i) * C(2n-2 choose n-1) * 2.

Wait, for the first example, 2n=2, i=1. s_2 - s_1 =4-1=3. C(0,0)=1. So 3 *1 *2=6, which matches. For the second example, 2n=4. For i=1: s_4 -s_1=2-1=1. For i=2: s_3 -s_2=2-1=1. Sum is 1+1=2. Multiply by C(2,1)=2 *2 (for each i) gives 2 *2=4. But the answer is 12. So this is incorrect.

But wait, in the second example, each pair (s_1, s_4), (s_2, s_3) contribute 1 each. The total per partition would be 2. But there are 6 partitions. 6 *2=12. So how does this fit?

The number of partitions where the pairs (s_1 and s_4) are in P and Q would be C(2n-2, n-1) = C(2, 1) =2. Similarly for (s_2 and s_3). So for i=1, the contribution is 1 * 2 (number of subsets where s_1 is in P and s_4 in Q) + 1 *2 (subsets where s_4 is in P and s_1 in Q) =4. For i=2, similarly 1*2 +1*2=4. Total sum 8. But the actual answer is 12. So this is still incorrect.

But the actual example's answer is 12. So this suggests that there's a different pattern.

Maybe the correct approach is to realize that for each i, the contribution is the sum over all possible ways to choose i-1 elements before a certain position and n-i elements after, and similarly for the other elements. But how?

Another Idea:

After sorting S, the sum over all partitions is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets where the first n elements contain exactly i-1 elements in the first i positions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each i in 1..n, the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by binomial coefficient C(2n, n) / (n+1) or some other function. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the sum over all pairs (i, j) where i <=n < j, and each pair contributes (s_j - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets where exactly k elements are chosen from the first n elements and (n-k) from the rest. But how?

This is getting too time-consuming, but I need to find a way to proceed.

Let me look for a pattern in the examples.

First example: n=1, sorted array [1,4]. The answer is 6. Here, the sum is (4-1) * 2 =6.

Second example: n=2, sorted array [1,1,2,2]. The answer is 12. The sum is 2*6=12, where each partition contributes 2, and there are 6 partitions.

But if each pair (1,2) is contributing 1, then for each of the 4 pairs (1,2) in the sorted array, each is used in some number of subsets. But there are 4 pairs (1,2), but how?

Alternatively, the answer is the sum over all pairs (s_j, s_k) with j <=n and k >n, multiplied by (s_k - s_j) multiplied by the number of ways to choose P such that j is included in P and k is not, and the rest is chosen accordingly.

But what's the number of such ways?

If j is in P and k is not, then we need to choose n-1 elements from the remaining 2n-2 elements. But this includes other elements. So the number of subsets where j is in P and k is in Q is C(2n-2, n-1).

So for each pair (j, k) where j is in the first half (j <=n) and k is in the second half (k >n), the contribution is (s_k - s_j) multiplied by C(2n-2, n-1).

But also, if k is in the first half and j is in the second half, then the contribution is (s_j - s_k), which would be added for other pairs.

But if we consider all pairs (j, k) where j <k and j is in the first half and k is in the second half, then the total contribution would be sum_{j=1 to n} sum_{k=n+1 to 2n} (s_k - s_j) * C(2n-2, n-1).

But for the first example, this would be (4-1) * C(0,0) =3 *1=3. But since j=1 and k=2 (n+1=2), and there are 2 subsets (P contains j or not?), wait no. C(2n-2, n-1) for n=1 is C(0,0)=1. So 3*1=3. But the answer is 6, so there's a factor of 2 missing.

Ah, because each pair (j, k) where j <k and j is in P and k is in Q contributes once, but the reverse (k in P and j in Q) also contributes once. So for each pair (j <k), the total contribution is (s_k - s_j) * (number of subsets where j is in P and k is in Q) + (s_k - s_j) * (number of subsets where k is in P and j is in Q). But since s_k - s_j is positive when k>j, this becomes 2*(s_k -s_j) * C(2n-2, n-1).

Wait, no. If j <k, then when j is in P and k in Q, the contribution is s_k -s_j. When k is in P and j in Q, the contribution is s_k -s_j again (since x_i is in P and y_i is in Q). So for each pair (j, k) with j <k, the total contribution is 2*(s_k -s_j) multiplied by the number of subsets where exactly one of j or k is in P.

But the number of subsets where exactly one of j or k is in P is 2 * C(2n-2, n-1). Because for j in P and k not: C(2n-2, n-1), and for k in P and j not: C(2n-2, n-1).

So the total contribution from pair (j, k) is 2*(s_k -s_j)*C(2n-2, n-1).

If this is the case, then the answer would be sum_{j=1 to 2n} sum_{k=j+1 to 2n} 2*(s_k -s_j)*C(2n-2, n-1).

But this is computationally O( (2n)^2 ), which is 3e10 operations for n=1.5e5, which is way too slow.

But wait, this can be optimized using prefix sums. Let's see.

The sum can be rewritten as 2*C(2n-2, n-1) * sum_{j=1 to 2n} sum_{k=j+1 to 2n} (s_k -s_j).

The inner sum sum_{j <k} (s_k -s_j) can be computed as sum_{k=1 to 2n} s_k * (k-1) - sum_{j=1 to 2n} s_j * (2n - j).

For example, for each s_k, it contributes to the sum for j=1 to k-1. So the total contribution for s_k is s_k * (k-1). For each s_j, it is subtracted once for each k>j. So the total contribution of s_j is -s_j * (2n -j).

Thus, the sum can be computed as sum_{k=1 to 2n} s_k * (k-1) - sum_{j=1 to 2n} s_j * (2n - j).

Which is equal to sum_{k=1 to 2n} s_k * (k-1 - (2n -k)) = sum_{k=1 to 2n} s_k * (2k - 2n -1).

But this is for all pairs j <k. So the total sum is 2*C(2n-2, n-1) * sum_{k=1 to 2n} s_k * (k-1) - sum_{j=1 to 2n} s_j * (2n -j).

But how can this be simplified?

Let me compute it for the first example: sorted array [1,4]. sum_{j<k} (4-1) =3. Multiply by 2*C(0,0)*3= 2*1*3=6, which matches.

Second example: sorted [1,1,2,2]. sum_{j<k} (s_k -s_j) is:

Pairs:

1-1: 0

1-2:1

1-2:1

1-2:1

1-2:1

2-2:0

Sum is 1+1+1+1=4. Multiply by 2 * C(2,1) =2*2=4. 4*4=16. But the correct answer is 12. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, here's the problem: the formula would compute 2*C(2n-2, n-1)* sum_{j<k} (s_k - s_j). But in the second example, C(2n-2, n-1) is C(2,1) =2. sum_{j<k} (s_k -s_j) is 4. 2*2*4=16, but the correct answer is 12. So there's a discrepancy.

Thus, this approach is incorrect.

But where is the mistake?

The mistake is assuming that every pair (j, k) with j <k contributes to the sum, but in reality, the contribution depends on whether the elements are in the correct positions in P and Q. So the previous approach overcounts because not all pairs (j, k) are considered in the sum for each subset.

Thus, the correct way is not to consider all pairs (j, k) where j <k, but only those pairs where j is in P and k is in Q, and their positions in P and Q meet certain criteria.

But how?

At this point, after hours of thinking, I think the correct approach is to sort the array and realize that for each i from 1 to n, the contribution is (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(2n choose n) / 2. But this is not working in the second example.

Alternatively, after sorting, the answer is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by C(2n choose n-1). But in the first example, this gives (4-1) * C(2,0)=3 *1=3, multiplied by 2 (since each pair is considered twice), which gives 6. Which matches. In the second example, sum is (2-1) + (2-1) =2. Multiply by C(4,1) =4. 2*4=8. But the answer is 12. So this is not correct.

But wait, the correct answer in the second example is 12. So 8 is not sufficient.

Thus, another Idea: after sorting the array, the answer is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by C(2n choose n) / n. For the second example, sum is 2. C(4 choose 2)=6. 2 *6=12. Which matches.

This would be the case if each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}) contributes (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by C(2n choose n) / n. But why?

In the first example, n=1. C(2,1)=2. 2/1=2. 3*2=6. Correct.

In the second example, sum is (2-1)+(2-1)=2. C(4,2)=6. 2*6=12. Correct.

Third example: all elements are 2. So the sum is zero. Correct.

Fourth example: need to compute but let's assume it's correct.

So the formula is:

Sort the array S in non-decreasing order.

Compute sum_{i=1 to n} (S[i + n] - S[i]) * C(2n choose n).

Then, output this sum modulo 998244353.

But wait, why?

In the first example, sum is (4-1) * C(2,1) =3 *2=6.

Yes.

Second example: sum is (2-1)+(2-1) =2. 2 * C(4,2)=2*6=12.

Yes.

Third example: sum is zero.

Yes.

So this seems to work. But why?

Because for each partition P and Q, the sum of |x_i - y_i| is equal to the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) for each i. But this is only true when P consists of the first n elements and Q consists of the last n elements, but not sure.

Wait, but in the first example, the two possible partitions are P={1} and Q={4}, and vice versa. In the first case, the sum is 3. In the second case, the sum is also 3. Total 6. Which matches 3*2=6.

In the second example, the sum for each partition is 2, and there are 6 partitions. 6*2=12.

So the formula seems to work. But why?

The key insight is that for each possible subset P, the sum of |x_i - y_i| equals the sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i), but this is only true when the entire array is split into the first half and the second half. But how can this be generalized to all possible subsets?

The answer must be that the sum over all subsets P of sum_{i=1 to n} |x_i - y_i| is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets, which is C(2n, n).

But why is this the case? Because for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}) in the sorted array, every subset P contributes exactly once to the sum for each i.

This seems to work for the examples, but I need to understand why.

Another Idea: For each i from 1 to n, the pairs (s_i, s_{n+i}) are the ones that contribute to the sum. For every subset P, exactly one of s_i or s_{n+i} is in P and the other is in Q. The contribution for this pair to the sum is |s_i - s_{n+i}|. But since in the sum over all subsets, each subset contributes exactly n terms, each of which is a pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the total sum is the sum over all pairs (s_i, s_{n+i}) of (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets where exactly one of s_i or s_{n+i} is in P. The number of such subsets is 2^{2n-1}, but for each pair, it's C(2n-2, n-1) * 2.

But in our previous examples, the total sum is sum_{i=1 ton} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * C(2n, n).

Thus, the correct approach is to sort the array, compute the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) for i=1 to n, multiply by C(2n, n), and take modulo 998244353.

This seems to fit all examples. So the code would be:

Sort the array.

Compute the sum of (a_sorted[n+i] - a_sorted[i]) for i in 0..n-1 (assuming 0-based indexing).

Multiply this sum by comb(2n, n).

Output the result modulo 998244353.

But wait, in the first example, comb(2,1)=2. sum is (4-1) =3. 3*2=6.

Second example: sum is (2-1)+(2-1)=2. comb(4,2)=6. 2*6=12.

Yes.

Third example: sum is (2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)=0. 0* comb(6,3)=0.

Yes.

Fourth example: the output would be the sum of the pairs (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by comb(10,5).

So this seems to be the correct approach.

But why does this work?

Because for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), every subset P must include exactly one of them. For each such pair, the contribution to the sum is (s_{n+i} - s_i) if the subset P includes s_i and excludes s_{n+i}, or (s_{n+i} - s_i) if the subset P includes s_{n+i} and excludes s_i. In both cases, the contribution is s_{n+i} - s_i. The number of subsets that include exactly one of s_i or s_{n+i} is 2 * comb(2n-2, n-1). Because you choose one of the two elements, and then n-1 elements from the remaining 2n-2 elements.

But summing this for all i from 1 to n gives sum_{i} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * 2 * comb(2n-2, n-1).

But according to the examples, the correct answer is sum_{i} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n).

So why are these two expressions equal?

Because 2*comb(2n-2, n-1) = comb(2n, n) / n * 2n ?

Wait, perhaps not. But how?

The value of comb(2n, n) is the total number of subsets. For each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the number of subsets that include exactly one of them is 2*comb(2n-2, n-1). So summing over all pairs would give sum_{i} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * 2*comb(2n-2, n-1).

But according to the examples, this is equal to sum_{i} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n).

So this implies that 2*comb(2n-2, n-1) = comb(2n, n).

But this is not true. For example, when n=1, 2*comb(0,0)=2*1=2, comb(2,1)=2. So equality holds. For n=2, 2*comb(2,1)=4, comb(4,2)=6. 4 !=6. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the previous reasoning is incorrect, but the examples seem to fit. So there must be a different explanation.

The correct approach is to note that for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the sum over all subsets P of |x_i - y_i| is (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets where s_i is in P and s_{n+i} is in Q, plus the same for s_{n+i} in P and s_i in Q. This is 2*(s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of subsets where exactly one of s_i and s_{n+i} is in P. The number of such subsets is comb(2n-2, n-1) * 2. So for each pair (i, n+i), the contribution is 2*(s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n-2, n-1).

But according to the examples, the correct answer is sum_{i} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n). This suggests that comb(2n, n) = 2*comb(2n-2, n-1) for each pair. But this is not true.

But in the first example, comb(2,1) =2, which is 2*comb(0,0)=2*1=2.

In the second example, comb(4,2)=6. The sum of contributions for the two pairs is 2*(comb(2,1) + comb(2,1)) = 2*(2+2)=8, but the correct answer is 6*2=12. So the previous approach is incorrect.

Thus, the initial hypothesis that the answer is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n) must be incorrect. But the examples fit. How?

It turns out that this hypothesis works for the examples, but why?

The answer lies in the fact that for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the number of subsets where exactly one of them is in P is comb(2n-2, n-1) * 2. Summing this over all i pairs gives the total contribution. However, this is not the case for the second example.

But in the second example, the sorted array is [1,1,2,2], and pairs are (1,2) and (1,2). Each pair contributes (2-1)*comb(2,1)*2=1*2*2=4. Two pairs, total 8. But the answer is 12. So this approach is still incorrect.

So the initial hypothesis is incorrect, but the examples pass. This suggests that there's a different pattern. 

But how?

Another Idea: Perhaps the sum over all subsets P is equal to the sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the other elements.

For example, for each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}), the number of subsets P that contain exactly one of s_i or s_{n+i} is 2 * comb(2n-2, n-1). So for each pair, the contribution is (s_{n+i} - s_i) * 2 * comb(2n-2, n-1).

Summing this for all pairs gives the total sum.

But for the second example, n=2. For each pair (1,2), the contribution is 1 * 2 * comb(2,1) = 2 *2=4. There are two pairs, so total 8. But the correct answer is 12. So this is still wrong.

But the correct answer for the second example is 12. How?

Looking back, the second example's sum is 12, which is 6 subsets * 2 per subset. So each subset contributes 2. So the sum is 6*2=12.

The formula sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n) gives (2-1)+(2-1) =2. 2*6=12. Which matches.

But why does this work?

Because the sum for all subsets P of the sum of |x_i - y_i| is equal to the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) for each pair in the sorted array, multiplied by the number of subsets.

But why is this the case?

Because for any subset P, when you sort P and Q (reversed), the sum of |x_i - y_i| is exactly the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) for each i from 1 to n. But how?

This is only true if P contains exactly one element from each pair (s_i, s_{n+i}). But this is not necessarily the case. For example, if a subset P contains both s_i and s_{n+i}, then the contribution would be zero for that pair, but according to the formula, it would still be counted.

But why does the formula work for the examples?

This suggests that the formula is correct, but the underlying reasoning is missing. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the sum over all subsets is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n).

But how to prove this?

Let's consider a subset P of size n. After sorting P and Q (complement), the sum of |x_i - y_i| is the sum of (y_i -x_i) if y_i >x_i, but since the array is sorted, x is non-decreasing and y is non-increasing. So for each i, x_i is the i-th element of P, and y_i is the (n-i+1)-th element of Q. So when the array is sorted, perhaps x_i and y_i are always from the pairs (s_i, s_{n+i}).

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum over all subsets is the same as the sum over all possible pairs (s_i, s_j) where i is in P and j is in Q, multiplied by the number of subsets where this is the case, and that the sum can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} (s_{n+i} - s_i) * comb(2n, n).

But the proof is missing.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with this formula, sort the array, compute the sum of (s_{n+i} - s_i) for i from 0 to n-1 (0-based), multiply by comb(2n, n), and output modulo 998244353.

Thus, the code would be:

Sort the array.

Compute the sum of (a_sorted[n +i] - a_sorted[i]) for i in 0..n-1.

Multiply by comb(2n, n).

Mod by 998244353.

But how to compute comb(2n, n) modulo 998244353 for n up to 1.5e5?

The maximum n is 1.5e5, so 2n is up to 3e5. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to 3e5.

Thus, the code steps are:

- Read n and the array.

- Sort the array.

- Compute comb(2n, n) modulo 998244353.

- Compute the sum of (a[n +i] -a[i]) for i in 0..n-1.

- Multiply the sum by comb(2n, n) modulo 998244353.

- Output the result.

So the code would look like this.

Third example:

n=3, array [2,2,2,2,2,2]. sum is 0. 0* comb(6,3) =0.

Fourth example:

The answer is 2588544. Assuming the code works.

Thus, this approach seems to work for all examples.

The final code would thus:

Read n.

Read the array, sort it.

Precompute factorial and inv_factorial up to 2n.

Compute comb = factorial[2n] * inv_factorial[n]^2 mod MOD.

Compute the sum of (a[i+n] - a[i]) for i in 0..n-1.

Multiply sum * comb mod MOD.

Output.

Thus, the code is as follows.

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    n = int(data[0])
    a = list(map(int, data[1:2*n+1]))
    a.sort()
    
    max_n = 2 * n
    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i-1] * i % MOD
    
    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    
    comb = factorial[2*n] * inv_fact[n] % MOD
    comb = comb * inv_fact[n] % MOD
    
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total = (total + (a[i + n] - a[i])) % MOD
    
    ans = total * comb % MOD
    print(ans)
