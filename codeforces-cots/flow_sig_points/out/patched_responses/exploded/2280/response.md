<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm. The problem is about counting the number of valid colorings of a perfect binary tree, considering some nodes are already colored. The constraints are pretty tight, especially since k can be up to 60, which means the tree has up to 2^60-1 nodes. Oh right, but we can't process each node individually because that's way too big. So we need a smart way to handle this, probably using some dynamic programming (DP) approach and memoization based on the structure of the binary tree.

First, let's understand the rules. The coloring must ensure that adjacent nodes (parent and child) are compatible according to the Rubik's cube's neighboring colors. The allowed colors are six: white, yellow, green, blue, red, orange. Each color has certain forbidden adjacent colors. For example, white can't be adjacent to white or yellow. So for each node, the color must be chosen such that it's compatible with its parent and its children.

But since the tree is perfect and binary, maybe there's a pattern or a way to represent the DP state based on the color of the current node and the possible colors of its children. But wait, the tree is built in a way that each node has exactly two children (except leaves). So for each node, the DP state might depend on the colors of the children, but how to handle that when the tree is huge?

Wait, but for a perfect binary tree, all nodes are structured in a way that's hierarchical. Each subtree is a perfect binary tree as well. So perhaps the DP can be done in a recursive manner, considering the structure of the subtree. But since the tree can have 2^60 levels, recursion would not be feasible unless we can find a way to compute it in logarithmic time, using some matrix exponentiation or similar technique.

But there's a catch: some nodes are already colored. These special nodes break the uniformity of the tree, so the standard approach for a perfect binary tree without any constraints might not work. We need to handle these special nodes by ensuring that their colors are fixed and that their parents and children comply with the constraints.

So the problem is to model the DP in such a way that for each subtree, we track the possible colors of the root and the number of valid colorings given that color. However, the presence of fixed nodes complicates this, as those nodes impose constraints that must be checked during the DP.

Let me think about how to model the DP. For a node without any fixed color, the number of valid colorings for the subtree rooted at that node depends on the color chosen for the root, and the valid colorings of its left and right subtrees. For each color c of the root, we need to consider the allowed colors for the left and right children (since they must be compatible with c), multiply the possibilities for left and right, and sum over all valid combinations.

But how do the fixed nodes affect this? If a node is fixed to a certain color, then in the DP, when processing that node, the only allowed color is the fixed one. Also, when processing its parent, the parent's color must be compatible with the fixed color of the child. Similarly, when processing the children of a fixed node, their colors must be compatible.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess the fixed nodes and store their colors in a map for quick access.

2. For each node, when processing its subtree, check if the node is fixed. If yes, then its color is fixed, and we can only proceed if the parent's color (if any) is compatible. Otherwise, compute the possibilities for all allowed colors, considering the constraints from the children and the parent.

But the problem is that the tree is huge (up to 2^60 nodes), so we can't process each node. Instead, we need to find a way to represent the structure of the tree and the fixed nodes in a way that allows us to compute the DP efficiently.

Wait, the number of fixed nodes is up to 2000. So maybe we can model the tree as a structure where most of the subtrees are "free" (no fixed nodes), and only a few subtrees have fixed nodes. Then, for the free subtrees, we can precompute their DP values based on their depth and the color of their root. But for the subtrees that contain fixed nodes, we have to process them recursively, breaking them down into left and right subtrees, and so on.

But how do we handle the fixed nodes? For example, if a fixed node is somewhere deep in the tree, then the path from the root to this fixed node must be handled carefully. The nodes along that path might have fixed colors or not, and their siblings' subtrees may be processed normally.

Hmm. Let's think recursively. For a given node, if it's not fixed, then the number of valid colorings for its subtree is the sum over all possible colors c (that are compatible with its parent's color) of (number of valid colorings for left subtree given that the left child's color is compatible with c) multiplied by the same for the right subtree. If the node is fixed, then c must be the fixed color, and we check if it's compatible with the parent's color. Then, the left and right children must be processed accordingly.

But again, the problem is the size of the tree. For example, if a subtree is completely free (no fixed nodes), then its contribution can be computed using a precomputed value based on the height of the subtree.

So the key idea is to find for each possible subtree height, the number of valid colorings given the color of the root. For a subtree of height h (where height is the number of levels), the root has two children, each of which is the root of a subtree of height h-1. So for each color c of the root, the left and right children must be compatible with c. Then, the number of colorings for the subtree is the product of the possibilities for the left and right subtrees for each valid pair of colors (l, r) compatible with c.

But for a subtree of height 1 (a single node, which is a leaf), the number of colorings for that subtree (assuming it's not fixed) is 1 if it's fixed, else 6 options, but only if there's no fixed color. Wait, no: for a leaf node, there are no children, so the only constraint is that its color is compatible with its parent (if any). But when processing a subtree, the parent's color is considered in the parent's DP. So for the DP of a subtree, the state is the color of the root, and the value is the number of valid colorings of that subtree given that the root has color c, considering the fixed nodes within the subtree and their constraints.

Wait, perhaps the DP for a subtree is represented as a function that, given the color of the root, returns the number of valid colorings for the subtree. Then, when combining subtrees (like left and right children), the parent's color must be compatible with the children's colors.

But how do we handle the fixed nodes? For example, if the current node is fixed to a color c, then when processing its children, their colors must be compatible with c. But if the children are not fixed, their colors can vary as long as they are compatible.

So the approach is:

We can model the tree as a hierarchy, and process nodes recursively. But for nodes that are fixed, their color is fixed, and their children must be processed accordingly. For nodes not fixed, we have to consider all possible colors compatible with their parent, and compute the product of possibilities for the left and right subtrees.

But since the tree can be very deep (k up to 60), we can't process every node. So the way to handle this is to use memoization for subtrees that don't contain any fixed nodes, and compute their contribution using a precomputed DP table based on the height of the subtree.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute for each possible subtree height h (from 0 to k-1), the number of colorings for that subtree given the root's color. Let's call this dp[h][c], where c is the color of the root. Since the maximum k is 60, this precomputation is feasible.

2. Then, handle the fixed nodes by traversing the tree from the root to the fixed nodes. For each node in the path of a fixed node, if it's not fixed, we have to compute its color possibilities based on the parent's color and the fixed nodes in its subtree. Otherwise, if it's fixed, ensure compatibility with the parent and proceed.

Wait, perhaps the presence of fixed nodes creates "islands" in the tree where the DP must be computed normally, and other parts where the precomputed values can be used.

For example, imagine a fixed node deep in the tree. The path from the root to this node must be processed step by step, but the subtrees that are siblings of nodes along this path (and not containing any fixed nodes) can use the precomputed DP values.

This suggests that the problem can be modeled as a hierarchy of nodes where each subtree is either:

a) A free subtree (no fixed nodes) with a certain height, for which we can use the precomputed dp[h][c].

b) A subtree that contains fixed nodes, which needs to be processed recursively, breaking into left and right children, and combining their results.

This way, the number of nodes that need to be processed recursively is proportional to the number of fixed nodes, which is up to 2000, which is manageable.

So the plan is:

- Precompute dp[h][c] for all h (up to 60) and colors c. This dp represents the number of valid colorings for a subtree of height h, with the root colored c, assuming no fixed nodes in the subtree.

- Then, process the tree recursively, starting from the root. For each node:

   - Check if the current node is fixed. If yes, then its color is fixed. Check if it's compatible with the parent's color (if there is a parent). Then, process its left and right children.

   - If the current node is not fixed, and the current subtree (starting from this node) does not contain any fixed nodes (i.e., all fixed nodes are outside of this subtree), then return the precomputed dp value for the subtree's height and the allowed color (based on the parent's color).

   - Otherwise, compute for each possible color c (compatible with parent's color) the product of the left and right children's results (for colors compatible with c), and sum them up. Then, multiply by 1 if the node is not fixed, or check if the fixed color is compatible and use that.

Wait, but how do we track which subtrees contain fixed nodes? Because if a subtree contains a fixed node, then we have to process it recursively. Otherwise, use the precomputed dp.

So we need a way to check whether a given subtree (defined by its root node and height) contains any fixed nodes. Since the fixed nodes are up to 2000, we can pre-process their positions and for each subtree (node and height), determine if there are any fixed nodes in that subtree.

But for that, perhaps we can represent the fixed nodes in a sorted list and, given a subtree's root and height, check if any of the fixed nodes fall within that subtree.

But how to check that efficiently?

Each node in a perfect binary tree can be uniquely identified. The subtree rooted at node v has a certain range of nodes. For example, the root is 1. Its left child is 2, right is 3. The subtree rooted at v will include all descendants of v. The nodes in the subtree can be determined by the path from v to the leaves.

Alternatively, the depth of a node can be determined. For example, the root is depth 1 (assuming k is the number of levels). Each node's position in the tree can be determined by its binary representation. But perhaps a better way is to compute the range of nodes that belong to the subtree rooted at v with height h. For example, the subtree of height h rooted at v has 2^h -1 nodes. But given that the tree is perfect, each node's subtree can be calculated based on the level.

Wait, but the tree is built such that the root is at level 1 (or maybe level 0? The problem statement says a perfect binary tree of 2^k -1 nodes, where the leaves are at level k. So the depth of the root is 1, and each level has nodes. So for a subtree of height h (number of levels), the number of nodes is 2^h -1. So for example, the root of the entire tree has height k, and a leaf has height 1.

Wait, the problem statement says "perfect binary tree of 2^k -1 nodes". So for k levels (maybe 1-based?), the root is level 1, then each level has 2^{level-1} nodes. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=1}^k 2^{i-1} } = 2^k -1.

So for a subtree rooted at node v, which is at level l, the height of the subtree is h, then the subtree has 2^h -1 nodes, and spans levels from l to l + h -1. So the leaves of the subtree are at level l + h -1.

But how to check if any fixed node is in the subtree rooted at v with height h. One approach is to precompute for each fixed node the path from the root to that node, and for each node v along that path, track the possible heights.

Alternatively, for each node in the tree, when processing a subtree rooted at v with height h, we can check if any of the fixed nodes is a descendant of v and in the subtree of height h. But checking this for each node would be O(n) per check, which could be expensive if done naively for each recursive step.

But given that n is up to 2000, and the recursive steps may be up to O(n) times (since each fixed node adds a path of O(k) steps, but k is up to 60), perhaps this is manageable.

Another approach is to represent the fixed nodes in a set, and for a given subtree (root and height), check if any of the fixed nodes are within that subtree.

But how to check that quickly?

Each node in the tree can be uniquely identified by its index. The subtree rooted at node v with height h includes all nodes that are descendants of v up to h levels deep. So to check if a fixed node u is in the subtree of v with height h, we can determine the ancestor of u at the same level as v. If that ancestor is v, and the depth of u is within h levels below v, then u is in the subtree.

Wait, but the depth of v is d, then the subtree of height h has nodes with depth from d to d + h -1. So for a node u, to be in the subtree, it must be a descendant of v, and its depth is <= d + h -1.

Alternatively, the subtree can be viewed as the set of nodes formed by starting at v and recursively including its children for h levels. So for a node u, we can find the path from u to the root and see if v is an ancestor of u, and the distance from v to u is less than h.

But calculating that for each u in the fixed nodes could be time-consuming. However, since n is up to 2000, for each subtree check, we can iterate through all fixed nodes and see if they are in the subtree. If any is present, then we have to process recursively; otherwise, use the precomputed dp.

So here's the plan for checking:

Given the current subtree root v and height h, check for each fixed node u:

1. Is u in the subtree of v?

   - To check if u is a descendant of v. Since the tree is a perfect binary tree, each node's path from the root can be determined. For example, the left child of node x is 2x, right is 2x+1. So to check if u is a descendant of v, we can check whether during the division by 2 (going up the tree), we reach v.

   For example, starting from u, divide by 2 (integer division) each time until we reach 0. If at any step, the current node is v, then u is a descendant of v.

   Wait, but how to check if u is in the subtree rooted at v with height h? Because the subtree's height is h, so the maximum depth of u in the subtree is v's depth + h -1.

   So first, compute the depth of v. Then, for u to be in the subtree, it must be a descendant of v, and its depth must be <= v's depth + h -1.

   The depth of a node can be computed as the floor of log2(v) +1. Wait, for example, the root is 1. Its depth is 1. Its children 2 and 3 are depth 2. So for any node v, its depth is the number of bits in the binary representation of v. Because the binary representation of v (excluding leading 1) gives the path from the root. For example, v=5 (binary 101) is depth 3.

   So the depth of a node can be computed as the bit length of v. For example, 1 is 1 in binary (1 bit, depth 1), 2 is 10 (2 bits, depth 2), 5 is 101 (3 bits, depth 3).

   So, for a node v, depth d = v.bit_length().

   Then, the subtree rooted at v with height h includes nodes u such that u is a descendant of v (i.e., v is an ancestor of u) and u's depth is <= d + h -1.

   So for a fixed node u, to check if it is in the subtree (v, h):

   - Check if v is an ancestor of u (u's path includes v as a parent in some step).

   - Check if the depth of u <= depth of v + h -1.

   How to check if v is an ancestor of u:

   We can do this by checking whether v appears in the path of u when moving up to the root. For example, starting with u, while u > 0, check if u == v. If yes, return true. Otherwise, divide u by 2 (integer division) until u becomes 0.

   But for large u (up to 2^60-1), this loop may take O(k) steps, which is manageable since k is up to 60 and n is 2000. So for each check, O(k) steps for each of the 2000 fixed nodes, and per recursive call, this is O(2000 * 60) steps. Since the number of recursive calls is O(n * k), this could be acceptable.

   So during the processing of a subtree (v, h), we check all the fixed nodes to see if any are in the subtree. If none, then use the precomputed dp. Otherwise, process recursively.

   So the steps are:

   - Precompute the dp for all possible heights h (from 0 to 60) and colors c.

   - For each subtree (v, h), check if any fixed nodes are present in the subtree. If not, return the precomputed dp[h][c] (if c is allowed by the parent). If yes, then split into left and right children and process recursively.

   Now, how to precompute the dp:

   Let's think recursively. For a subtree of height h:

   - If h == 1 (leaf), then the root has no children. So the number of colorings for this root is 1 (if it's fixed), or 6 if not fixed. Wait, but wait: in the precomputed dp, the color is given. So dp[1][c] is 1 (since for a leaf, if the color is c, there's only one way to color it if there are no fixed nodes. But wait, the precomputed dp is for a subtree that has no fixed nodes. So the leaf can be colored in any color, but in the context of the DP, the color of the root is fixed (as part of the DP state). So for a leaf node (h=1), the dp is 1 for each color, because there's no constraints except from the parent. Wait, no. The dp[h][c] represents the number of valid colorings for a subtree of height h, given that the root is color c, and there are no fixed nodes in the subtree.

   So for h=1 (leaf), the subtree has only the root. So if the root's color is c, then there's 1 way. So dp[1][c] = 1 for all c.

   For h > 1, the root has two children (left and right), each of which is the root of a subtree of height h-1. So for the root's color c, the left and right children must choose colors compatible with c. For each valid pair (l, r) of colors compatible with c, the total is the product of dp[h-1][l] and dp[h-1][r]. Summing over all valid pairs (l, r) gives dp[h][c].

   So the recurrence is:

   dp[h][c] = sum_{l in allowed(c)} sum_{r in allowed(c)} (dp[h-1][l] * dp[h-1][r])

   But allowed(c) is the set of colors that can be adjacent to c. Let's model this.

   The allowed colors for a child of a node with color c are the colors that are compatible with c. Let's define a compatibility map. For each color c, list the colors that are allowed to be adjacent.

   The rules are:

   White can't be adjacent to white or yellow. So allowed neighbors are green, red, blue, orange.

   Yellow can't be adjacent to white or yellow. So allowed neighbors are green, red, blue, orange.

   Green can't be adjacent to green or blue. So allowed neighbors are white, yellow, red, orange.

   Blue can't be adjacent to green or blue. So allowed neighbors are white, yellow, red, orange.

   Red can't be adjacent to red or orange. So allowed neighbors are white, yellow, green, blue.

   Orange can't be adjacent to red or orange. So allowed neighbors are white, yellow, green, blue.

   So for each color c, the allowed adjacent colors are those not in the forbidden pairs.

   Let's create a dictionary that maps each color to its allowed adjacent colors.

   For example:

   allowed = {
       'white': {'green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'},
       'yellow': {'green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'},
       'green': {'white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'},
       'blue': {'white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'},
       'red': {'white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'},
       'orange': {'white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'},
   }

   So for a root color c, the left and right children must choose colors from allowed(c).

   Then, the dp recurrence for h > 1 is:

   dp[h][c] = (sum_{l in allowed(c)} dp[h-1][l}) ** 2

   Because each child can choose any allowed color, and the left and right are independent. So the sum for left is sum_l dp[h-1][l], and same for right. So the total is (sum_l dp[h-1][l})^2.

   Wait, that's a good observation. Because for each child (left and right), the number of possibilities is the same, and they are independent. So for the left child, the total possibilities for all allowed colors is sum_l dp[h-1][l], and similarly for the right child, so the total for the root is (sum_l dp[h-1][l})^2.

   This simplifies the calculation. So the recurrence is:

   For h >= 2:

   dp[h][c] = (sum_{l in allowed[c]} dp[h-1][l})^2

   So this way, we can precompute the dp for all h up to 60.

   Let's compute this.

   Initialize dp[1][c] = 1 for all c.

   Then, for each h from 2 to 60:

       for each color c in colors:

           sum_children = sum(dp[h-1][l] for l in allowed[c])

           dp[h][c] = (sum_children) ** 2

   Then, each dp[h][c] can be computed modulo 1e9+7.

   This precomputation is manageable, as h is up to 60 and there are 6 colors. So for each h, 6 entries. So 60*6 = 360 entries. Totally feasible.

   Once we have this dp table, the problem reduces to handling the fixed nodes.

   Now, the main challenge is to handle the fixed nodes. Let's think of the tree as a structure where certain nodes are fixed, and their presence requires us to split the tree into parts that are either fixed or can be handled with the dp.

   So for the root, if it's fixed, then its color is known, and we process the left and right children (each of which is a subtree of height k-1), but we have to check if those children's subtrees contain any fixed nodes.

   The approach is to use a recursive function that, given a node v, its height h, and the parent color (if any), returns a dictionary of possible colors for v and the number of valid colorings for the subtree given each color.

   But since the parent's color affects the allowed colors for the current node, we need to pass the parent's color down the tree. However, this could complicate the memoization, but given that the fixed nodes are limited, maybe it's manageable.

   Wait, but the parent's color is known when processing the current node. For example, when processing node v (which is a child of some parent), the parent's color is known, so the current node's color must be compatible with it. If the current node is fixed, its color must be compatible with the parent's color. Otherwise, the current node can choose any color compatible with the parent's color, and the children must be compatible with the current node's color.

   So the recursion function needs to track the parent's color and the current node's possible colors (if not fixed).

   Alternatively, for each node, if it's not fixed, the allowed colors are those compatible with the parent's color (if the parent exists). Then, for each allowed color, compute the product of the left and right subtrees' possibilities (for each child, their allowed colors are compatible with the current color).

   But this seems complicated. Let's model this with a helper function:

   Define a function dfs(v, h, parent_color) that returns a dictionary (or a map) from color c (allowed by parent_color) to the number of valid colorings of the subtree rooted at v (height h), given that the parent's color is parent_color.

   But parent_color can be None (for the root node, which has no parent). So for the root node, the allowed colors are all possible colors if it's not fixed, or just the fixed color if it is fixed.

   So the steps of the helper function:

   1. Check if the current subtree (v, h) has any fixed nodes. If not, return the precomputed dp[h] entries, but only for colors compatible with parent_color.

   2. If the subtree contains fixed nodes:

       a. Check if the current node v is fixed. If yes:

           i. Check if the fixed color is compatible with the parent_color (if parent exists). If not, return 0 for all colors (i.e., invalid).

           ii. Process the left and right children (each is a subtree of height h-1) with the parent_color being the fixed color of v.

           iii. Multiply the possibilities of left and right subtrees (each returns a count for their colors compatible with v's color). The total for v's fixed color is the product.

       b. If the current node v is not fixed:

           i. For each allowed color c (compatible with parent_color):

               - Check if any fixed nodes are in the subtree (v, h). If not, add the precomputed dp[h][c] multiplied by whether c is allowed.

               - Otherwise, process the left and right children (each of height h-1) with parent_color c.

               - The possibilities for left and right are the product of their possible counts.

           ii. Sum the possibilities for all allowed c.

       c. Return the sum for each allowed c.

   But this requires handling the current node's color and whether it's fixed, and processing the children accordingly.

   Let's formalize this.

   The helper function will return a dictionary of possible colors and their counts. However, since the parent's color is known (or None), the allowed colors for the current node are those compatible with the parent_color.

   For the root node, parent_color is None. So all colors are allowed (if not fixed), or only the fixed color (if fixed).

   For other nodes, parent_color is the color of their parent. So current node's color must be in allowed[parent_color].

   But for the helper function, when the current node is not fixed, it can choose any color in allowed[parent_color] (or all colors if parent is None for root).

   Wait, the parent_color for the root is None, so the allowed colors for the root are all possible colors (if it's not fixed). If it's fixed, then it's the fixed color.

   So, the helper function's steps:

   def dfs(v, h, parent_color):

       # Check if current subtree (v, h) contains any fixed nodes.

       has_fixed = any(u is in the subtree rooted at v with height h)

       if not has_fixed:

           # Return the precomputed dp[h], but filter for colors allowed by parent_color.

           if parent_color is None:

               return {c: dp[h][c] for c in all_colors}

           else:

               allowed_c = allowed_by_parent[parent_color]

               return {c: dp[h][c] for c in allowed_c}

       else:

           # Check if current node v is fixed.

           if v is in fixed_nodes:

               c_fixed = fixed_color[v]

               # Check compatibility with parent_color.

               if parent_color is not None and c_fixed not in allowed_by_parent[parent_color]:

                   return {}  # no valid colorings.

               # Process left and right children.

               left_v = 2*v

               right_v = 2*v +1

               left_h = h-1

               # Check if left child exists (h-1 >= 1)

               if h-1 ==0:

                   # No left and right children. But wait, h is the height of the subtree rooted at v. So if h=1, it's a leaf. So no children.

                   left_count = 1

                   right_count =1

               else:

                   left_count = dfs(left_v, h-1, c_fixed)

                   right_count = dfs(right_v, h-1, c_fixed)

                   # The left_count is a dictionary of colors allowed by c_fixed, but since left_v's subtree must be processed.

                   # Wait, but the left and right children's parent color is c_fixed. So the left child's allowed colors are allowed_by_parent[c_fixed].

                   # But in the left_count, which is the result of dfs(left_v, h-1, c_fixed), the keys are colors allowed by c_fixed, and the values are the counts.

                   # So the total for left is the sum of all possible left colors (allowed by c_fixed) multiplied by the same for right.

                   # Wait, no. For the left child, the parent is current node, color c_fixed. So left_count is the sum of all possible valid colorings for the left subtree given that the parent (current node) is c_fixed.

                   # Wait, no. The dfs returns a dictionary mapping color to count. But in this case, the left child's parent color is c_fixed. So the left child's color must be in allowed_by_parent[c_fixed]. So the left_count is the sum of the values in the dictionary returned by dfs(left_v, h-1, c_fixed).

                   # Because the left child can choose any color in allowed_by_parent[c_fixed], and the count is the sum over all possible colors for the left subtree.

                   # Similarly for the right child.

                   # So, for the left and right subtrees, the total possible colorings for each is the sum of their possible counts.

                   # Because the current node's color is fixed to c_fixed, the left child can be any color allowed by c_fixed, and similarly for the right.

                   # So for each of left and right, the sum of all possible counts (sum of values in left_count and right_count) gives the number of possibilities.

                   # So total is (sum(left_count.values())) * (sum(right_count.values())).

                   # But what if left_count or right_count is empty (invalid)? Then the product is zero.

                   sum_right = sum(right_count.values()) if right_count else 0

                   total = sum_left * sum_right

               # The current node's color is c_fixed, and the total is the product of left and right possibilities.

               # But since the current node is fixed, the total is added to the return dictionary only for c_fixed.

               return {c_fixed: total}

           else:

               filtered = {c: cnt for c, cnt in result.items() if cnt >0}

               return filtered

   Wait, but the current node is not fixed. So for each allowed color c (compatible with parent_color), the current node can choose c, and then the left and right children must be processed with parent color c.

   So for each color c in allowed_colors (allowed by parent_color), the count is the product of left and right possibilities.

   But for the current node's left and right subtrees (each of height h-1), which may have fixed nodes. So we need to process them recursively.

   Now, the problem is that for each node in the recursion, we need to check if its subtree contains any fixed nodes. If not, we can use the precomputed dp value. Otherwise, we process recursively.

   So the helper function must first check if the subtree (v, h) contains any fixed nodes. If not, return the precomputed dp[h][c], but only for colors allowed by the parent's color.

   But how to check if the subtree (v, h) contains any fixed nodes?

   For this, during the initial processing, we can create a set of all fixed nodes. Then, for a given v and h, we check if any of the fixed nodes is a descendant of v and has a depth <= depth(v) + h-1.

   So the steps for checking:

   For a given subtree (v, h), compute the depth of v (d = v.bit_length()). The maximum depth for nodes in this subtree is d + h -1. For each fixed node u, check:

   - Is u a descendant of v? (i.e., v is an ancestor of u)

   - Is the depth of u <= d + h -1?

   If any u in the fixed nodes satisfies both, then the subtree contains a fixed node.

   So how to implement this?

   For each fixed node u:

       current_u = u

       while current_u > 0:

           if current_u == v:

               # check depth of u <= d + h -1?

               depth_v = v.bit_length()

               depth_u = u.bit_length()

               if depth_u <= depth_v + h -1:

                   return True (subtree contains u)

               else:

                   break

           current_u = current_u // 2

       # after loop, no ancestor is v, so u is not in subtree.

   So for each fixed node, we can loop through its ancestors up to v. If during this process, we find that current_u == v, then check depth_u <= depth_v + h-1. If yes, then u is in the subtree.

   But this is O(n * k) for each call to check, which can be expensive if done for each recursive step. So we need to find a way to preprocess the fixed nodes and their ancestors to allow quick checking.

   Alternatively, during the initial processing, for each fixed node u, we can precompute all possible subtrees (v, h) that contain u. But this seems complicated.

   Alternatively, during the recursive steps, for each subtree (v, h), we can iterate through all fixed nodes and check if they are in the subtree. If any is found, then has_fixed is True.

   Let's proceed with this approach.

   Now, the problem is that for large k, the fixed nodes can be up to 2^60, but in practice, the fixed nodes are given as integers (v) up to 2^60 -1. However, in Python, handling such large integers for loops is manageable since even for 2^60, the loop to check ancestors is O(60) steps per fixed node.

   So in code:

   To check if the subtree (v, h) contains any fixed node u:

   depth_v = v.bit_length()

   max_depth = depth_v + h -1

   for u in fixed_nodes:

       current = u

       while current >= v:

           if current == v:

               # check if u's depth <= max_depth

               depth_u = u.bit_length()

               if depth_u <= max_depth:

                   return True

               else:

                   break

           current = current // 2

   So this loop is O(n * k) for each check. Since n is 2000 and k is 60, this is O(120000) per check. Considering that the number of recursive calls is O(n * k) (since each fixed node can create up to k recursive calls along its path), the total time for this part is O(120000 * 2000 * 60) = which is 14,400,000,000 operations. That's way too slow.

   This is a problem. We need a better way to check if a subtree (v, h) contains any fixed nodes.

   Alternative idea: Preprocess for each fixed node u, all possible ancestors v and the h that would include u in their subtree.

   For example, for each fixed u, and for each possible ancestor v (all ancestors up to the root), compute the minimum h such that the subtree rooted at v with h levels includes u.

   Then, for each v, we can store a list of h's that include some fixed u. But this seems difficult.

   Another idea: For each fixed node u, precompute all possible ancestors v and their possible h values where the subtree of v with h includes u.

   Alternatively, for each fixed node u, for all possible v in the path from u to the root, compute the maximum h that would include u in the subtree (v, h). For example, for v = u's ancestor at depth d_v, then the maximum h is (depth_u - d_v + 1). So for the subtree (v, h), if h >= (depth_u -d_v +1), then u is included.

   So for a given subtree (v, h), if there exists a fixed node u such that v is an ancestor of u, and h >= (depth_u - depth_v +1), then u is in the subtree.

   To check this efficiently, perhaps for each fixed node u, we can store its path (all ancestors). Then, for a given v and h, check if any fixed node's ancestor is v and the required h is >= the required value.

   But how to do this efficiently?

   Maybe we can create a dictionary that maps each node v to a list of fixed nodes u where v is an ancestor of u. Then, for a given v and h, we can check if any u in the list for v has depth <= (depth_v + h -1).

   For example:

   For all fixed nodes, precompute their path (all ancestors) and store each u in the lists for all their ancestors.

   Then, when checking if subtree (v, h) contains any fixed node, we can check the list of u's stored under v, and see if any has depth <= (depth_v + h-1).

   This way, the check for a given (v, h) is O(m), where m is the number of fixed nodes that have v as an ancestor. Since the total number of fixed nodes is up to 2000, and each has up to 60 ancestors, this is manageable.

   So steps:

   1. Preprocess for each fixed node u:

       a. Compute its path (all ancestors from u up to the root).

       b. For each ancestor v in the path:

           i. Compute the minimum h required for the subtree (v, h) to include u. h_min = depth_u - depth_v +1.

           ii. Store u in a dictionary under key v, along with h_min.

   2. For each subtree (v, h), to check if it contains any fixed node:

       a. Look up the list of u's stored under v in the dictionary.

       b. For each u in the list, check if h >= h_min. If yes, then u is in the subtree (v, h).

       c. If any such u exists, return True.

   This way, the check is O(m), where m is the number of fixed nodes that have v as an ancestor. For fixed nodes with up to 2000 entries, and each having up to 60 ancestors, this is manageable.

   This seems like a feasible approach.

   So, during preprocessing:

   Create a dictionary called ancestors, where ancestors[v] is a list of tuples (u, h_min), where u is a fixed node that has v as an ancestor, and h_min is the minimal h required for the subtree rooted at v to include u.

   Then, for a given (v, h), check if any of the u's in ancestors[v] have h >= h_min. If yes, then the subtree contains a fixed node.

   So the code for this:

   For each fixed node u:

       current = u

       while current >0:

           depth_current = current.bit_length()

           depth_u = u.bit_length()

           h_min = depth_u - depth_current +1

           if current not in ancestors:

               ancestors[current] = []

           ancestors[current].append( (u, h_min) )

           current = current //2

   Then, to check if subtree (v, h) contains any fixed node:

   if v is not in ancestors:

       return False

   else:

       for (u, h_min) in ancestors[v]:

           if h >= h_min:

               return True

       return False

   Wait, but this is not correct. Because the subtree (v, h) includes all nodes with depth up to depth_v + h -1. For u to be in the subtree:

   depth_u <= depth_v + h -1.

   But h_min = depth_u - depth_v +1. So h >= h_min implies:

   depth_v + h -1 >= depth_u → h >= h_min.

   So yes. So the check is correct.

   So during the preprocessing for each u, for all its ancestors v, compute h_min = (depth_u - depth_v +1). Then, during the check for (v, h), if h >= h_min for any u in ancestors[v], then u is in the subtree.

   So this allows us to check in O(m) time, where m is the number of fixed nodes in ancestors[v].

   With this, the check for whether a subtree contains any fixed node is manageable.

   So in code, during the preprocessing, we can build this ancestors dictionary.

   Now, with this optimization, the check for fixed nodes in a subtree is O(m), where m is the number of fixed nodes in ancestors[v], which is up to 2000 * 60 entries, but in practice, for each v, the list is likely small.

   Now, the helper function can be written as follows:

   The function will be called with parameters (v, h, parent_color). It returns a dictionary mapping colors to counts.

   Let's outline the code structure.

   First, precompute the allowed colors for each color.

   allowed = {
       'white': {'green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'},
       'yellow': {'green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'},
       'green': {'white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'},
       'blue': {'white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'},
       'red': {'white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'},
       'orange': {'white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'},
   }

   The colors can be represented as indices for easier handling, but maybe it's easier to use strings.

   Then, precompute the dp table.

   MOD = 10**9 +7

   colors = ['white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'orange']

   allowed_by_color = {
       'white': ['green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'],
       'yellow': ['green', 'red', 'blue', 'orange'],
       'green': ['white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'],
       'blue': ['white', 'yellow', 'red', 'orange'],
       'red': ['white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'],
       'orange': ['white', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'],
   }

   # Convert to indices for faster processing? Or keep as strings.

   # Precompute the allowed colors for each color.

   allowed_set = {color: set(allowed_by_color[color]) for color in colors}

   # Precompute dp.

   max_h = 60

   dp = [dict() for _ in range(max_h +1)]

   for c in colors:
       dp[1][c] = 1

   for h in range(2, max_h +1):
       for c in colors:
           allowed = allowed_set[c]
           sum_children = 0
           for l in allowed:
               sum_children += dp[h-1][l]
           sum_children %= MOD
           dp[h][c] = (sum_children * sum_children) % MOD

   Now, the helper function.

   The fixed nodes are stored in a dictionary: fixed = {v: color}

   The ancestors dictionary is built as described.

   Now, in the helper function:

   def dfs(v, h, parent_color):

       # Check if subtree (v, h) contains any fixed nodes.

       has_fixed = False

       if v in ancestors:

           for (u, h_min) in ancestors[v]:

               if h >= h_min:

                   has_fixed = True

                   break

       if not has_fixed:

           # No fixed nodes. Use precomputed dp.

           if parent_color is None:

               # All colors are allowed.

               return {c: dp[h][c] for c in colors}

           else:

               allowed_c = allowed_set[parent_color]

               return {c: dp[h][c] for c in allowed_c}

       else:

           # Subtree has fixed nodes. Process recursively.

           if v in fixed:

               # Current node is fixed.

               c_fixed = fixed[v]

               # Check compatibility with parent_color.

               if parent_color is not None and c_fixed not in allowed_set[parent_color]:

                   return {}

               # Process left and right children.

               if h ==1:

                   # Leaf node. No children.

                   return {c_fixed: 1}

               else:

                   left_v = 2*v

                   right_v = 2*v +1

                   left_h = h-1

                   left_result = dfs(left_v, left_h, c_fixed)

                   right_result = dfs(right_v, left_h, c_fixed)

                   sum_left = sum(left_result.values()) % MOD if left_result else 0

                   sum_right = sum(right_result.values()) % MOD if right_result else 0

                   total = (sum_left * sum_right) % MOD

                   return {c_fixed: total}

           else:

               # Current node is not fixed. Iterate over allowed colors.

               if parent_color is None:

                   allowed_colors = colors

               else:

                   allowed_colors = allowed_set[parent_color]

               result = {}

               for c in allowed_colors:

                   # Check if processing left and right children.

                   if h ==1:

                       # Leaf node. No children.

                       result[c] =1

                   else:

                       left_v = 2*v

                       right_v = 2*v +1

                       left_h = h-1

                       left_result = dfs(left_v, left_h, c)

                       right_result = dfs(right_v, left_h, c)

                       sum_left = sum(left_result.values()) % MOD if left_result else 0

                       sum_right = sum(right_result.values()) % MOD if right_result else 0

                       total = (sum_left * sum_right) % MOD

                       if total >0:

                           result[c] = total

               return result

   Now, the root is processed with v=1, h=k, and parent_color=None.

   The total number of valid colorings is the sum of the values in the dictionary returned by dfs(1, k, None).

   But wait, if the root is fixed, the result will have only one key (the fixed color), and others will be zero. Otherwise, it's a sum over all allowed colors.

   So the final answer is sum( dfs(1, k, None).values() ) % MOD.

   Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

   First example:

   Input:

   3

   2

   5 orange

   2 white

   The tree has 7 nodes (2^3-1). The root is 1. The fixed nodes are 5 (orange) and 2 (white).

   Let's see the processing.

   The root is 1, h=3. parent_color=None.

   The subtree contains fixed nodes (2 and 5). So has_fixed is True.

   Since 1 is not fixed, we iterate over allowed colors (all colors, since parent is None).

   For each color c in allowed_colors:

       process left (2, h=2) and right (3, h=2).

   For c in allowed_colors:

       Let's take c=white.

       For left child (2, h=2) with parent_color=white.

       Now, node 2 is fixed to white. So check if white is allowed by parent color white. White is not allowed (since white's allowed colors are green, red, blue, orange). So this path is invalid. So sum_left is zero.

       So c=white is invalid.

   Similarly, let's see for other colors.

   But in the example, the root's color is not fixed. So the valid colors for the root are those allowed by the parent (none), so all colors.

   Let's see. For example, if the root is green.

   Then, the left child (node 2) is fixed to white. But green allows children to be white, yellow, red, orange. White is allowed. So for left child (2, h=2, parent_color=green).

   Node 2 is fixed to white.

   So, check if white is allowed by parent_color green. Yes.

   Now, process left and right children of node 2 (h=2). The height of the subtree is 2, so node 2 has children 4 and 5.

   Node 5 is fixed to orange.

   Processing node 2 (fixed to white), with parent_color green.

   So, left child is 4, h=1. Fixed? No. So check if subtree (4, 1) has any fixed nodes. Only node 5 is fixed, but 4 is not an ancestor of 5. So no.

   So for left child, h=1, parent_color is white. Allowed colors for left child are allowed_set[white], which are green, red, blue, orange. The precomputed dp[1][c] is 1 for each. So sum_left is 4.

   The right child is 5, which is fixed to orange. parent_color is white. Check if orange is allowed. white's allowed colors are green, red, blue, orange. So yes.

   For the right child (5), h=1. Since it's a leaf, no children. So sum is 1.

   So sum_left =4, sum_right =1. product is 4*1=4. So node 2's contribution is 4.

   So the left child of the root (node 2) contributes 4.

   The right child of the root (node 3) is processed with parent_color green.

   The subtree (3, 2) is processed. Check if it contains any fixed nodes. For fixed nodes 5: 5's path is 5 → 2 → 1. So for node 3, no. So no fixed nodes in the subtree (3,2). So use dp[2][c], but allowed colors are those allowed by green.

   allowed colors for children of green are white, yellow, red, orange. So for each of these colors, dp[2][c] is precomputed.

   dp[2][white] is (sum of allowed children for white in h=1).

   For h=2 and c=white:

   sum_children is sum of allowed colors for white (green, red, blue, orange). Each has dp[1][c] =1. So sum_children =4. So dp[2][white] =4^2=16.

   Similarly for other colors allowed by green.

   So for node 3's processing (h=2), the allowed colors are white, yellow, red, orange. Their dp[2][c] values are:

   white: 16, yellow: 16, red: (allowed by green) and so on. Wait, wait, for h=2, each color's dp is (sum of allowed colors for h=1)^2.

   For example:

   For color red in h=2:

   allowed colors for red's children are white, yellow, green, blue. So sum_children = 4. dp[2][red] = 4^2=16.

   So all colors allowed by green have dp[2][c] =16.

   So sum_left (node 3's left and right subtrees) for each allowed color is 16.

   So for node 3, the total is 16 *16 = 256.

   So the right child's contribution is 256.

   So the root's color green has total 4 * 256 = 1024.

   But wait, the example's answer is 1024, which suggests that the root's color is green. But in the example, there may be other colors contributing as well.

   However, according to the first example's input, the root is not fixed. So the total number of valid colorings is the sum over all possible root colors that allow their children to be processed correctly.

   But the example's output is 1024. Which suggests that the only valid color for the root is green, and the product for left and right is 1024.

   So perhaps in this case, the root must be green to allow node 2 (fixed white) to be valid.

   Because when the root is green, node 2's color white is allowed. The left subtree of node 2 contributes 4 (since node 4's color can be any of green, red, blue, orange), but node 5's color is orange, which is allowed by node 2's color white.

   So the left subtree of the root (node 2) contributes 4 *1 (for node 5) =4.

   The right subtree (node 3) contributes 16 *16 = 256.

   So the product is 4 *256 = 1024.

   So the total is 1024.

   So this approach seems to work.

   Now, the code.

   But to handle the large nodes, the code must represent v as integers, and compute their bit lengths.

   Also, the fixed nodes are stored in a dictionary.

   Now, the code steps:

   1. Read k, n.

   2. Read the n fixed nodes, store them in a dictionary fixed.

   3. Precompute the ancestors for each fixed node.

   4. Precompute the dp table.

   5. Call dfs(1, k, None) and sum the values.

   Now, let's proceed to code.

   But in Python, recursion depth is limited. For k=60, the recursion depth could be up to 60, which is manageable.

   However, since each fixed node can cause the recursion to go down their path, which is up to 60 levels deep, but Python's default recursion limit is 1000, so it's okay.

   But for very large k, this could be an issue. However, the code should be written iteratively if possible, but with the given constraints, recursion may be manageable.

   But let's think. For each fixed node, the recursion depth is O(k). So with n=2000 and k=60, the maximum recursion depth is 60, which is well within Python's default.

   So the code can proceed.

   Now, the code:

   First, precompute allowed_set and dp.

   Then, process the fixed nodes and build the ancestors dictionary.

   Then, the dfs function.

   So here's the code:

Testing against sample input 2.

```python

            current = current // 2

    # Memoization for dfs? Not sure, but since Python has a limit on recursion depth, but for this problem, recursion is manageable.

    from functools import lru_cache

    # But since the parameters are v (up to 2^60), h (up to 60), and parent_color (6 options + None), memoization with lru_cache is not feasible.

    # So instead, we need to implement the dfs as a recursive function without memoization, relying on the fixed nodes to limit the recursion.

```output

```

   Third example:

   Input:

   10

   3

   1 blue

   4 red

   5 orange

   The code should output 328925088.

   The code should correctly handle the fixed nodes and compute the product.

   So this approach seems correct.
