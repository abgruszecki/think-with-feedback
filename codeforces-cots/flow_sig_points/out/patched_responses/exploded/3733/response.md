Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to compute the sum of the costs for all non-empty subsets of a team of N people. The cost for a subset of size x is x^k. And N can be up to 1e9, which is huge. Oh right, and k can be up to 5000. Hmm. So the constraints are tight, especially for N. We need a way that doesn't involve iterating through all subsets, obviously. Let's think about mathematical approaches.

First, let's understand what the problem is asking. For each non-empty subset of the N people, we calculate the size of the subset raised to the power k, and sum all those values. The sum is then taken modulo 1e9+7.

The straightforward approach would be to consider all subsets, but since there are 2^N -1 non-empty subsets, even for N=30, this becomes impossible. So, we need a mathematical formula that can compute this sum efficiently.

Let's think combinatorially. For each possible subset size x (from 1 to N), how many subsets of size x are there? The answer is C(N, x). For each such subset, the cost is x^k. So the total sum is sum_{x=1 to N} (C(N, x) * x^k).

So the problem reduces to computing this sum: sum_{x=1}^N C(N, x) * x^k.

Now, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently given that N can be up to 1e9 and k up to 5000. Because directly calculating this for each x is impossible when N is 1e9.

Let's look for generating functions or combinatorial identities that can help here. Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to express this sum in terms of known functions or recurrence relations.

Another approach: consider that x^k can be expressed using Stirling numbers of the second kind. The Stirling numbers S(k, m) allow us to write x^k as sum_{m=0}^k S(k, m) * m! * C(x, m). Let me recall that formula. Oh right, x^k = sum_{m=0}^k S(k, m) * (x)_m, where (x)_m is the falling factorial. Or equivalently, using combinations multiplied by m!.

So substituting this into the sum, we get sum_{x=1}^N C(N, x) * sum_{m=0}^k S(k, m) * m! * C(x, m). Then, swapping the order of summation, this becomes sum_{m=0}^k S(k, m) * m! * sum_{x=1}^N C(N, x) * C(x, m).

Now, the inner sum is sum_{x=1}^N C(N, x) * C(x, m). Wait, C(N, x) * C(x, m) can be simplified. Because C(N, x) * C(x, m) = C(N, m) * C(N -m, x -m). So when we sum over x from m to N (since C(x, m) is zero when x < m), the sum becomes C(N, m) * sum_{x=m}^N C(N -m, x - m). But the sum over x from m to N of C(N -m, x -m) is the same as sum_{t=0}^{N -m} C(N -m, t) = 2^{N -m}. So the inner sum is C(N, m) * 2^{N -m}.

So putting it all together, the total sum is sum_{m=0}^k S(k, m) * m! * C(N, m) * 2^{N -m}.

But since m ranges from 0 to k, and for m > N, C(N, m) is zero, so those terms can be ignored. But since N can be up to 1e9 and k up to 5000, and m is up to k, which is 5e3, but N is 1e9, which is much larger than k. So for m <=k, C(N, m) is (N*(N-1)*...*(N-m+1))/(m!). So this can be computed even when N is large.

So the key steps are:

1. Precompute the Stirling numbers of the second kind S(k, m) for all m up to k.

2. For each m from 0 to k, compute the term S(k, m) * m! * C(N, m) * 2^{N - m}.

3. Sum all these terms and subtract the m=0 term if necessary (since the original problem starts at x=1, which would include m=0 only if x >=1 and m=0. Wait, when x >=1, but m can be zero. Wait, when m=0, x^k = sum_{m=0}^k ... but S(k, 0) is zero except when k=0? Hmm. Let's think. Stirling numbers S(k, m) count the number of ways to partition a set of k elements into m non-empty subsets. So S(k, 0) is zero for k>0. Since k is at least 1 (from the input constraints: k can be 1). Wait, no, input constraints say k can be 1. So when k is 1, m ranges from 0 to 1. But S(1, 0) is 0, S(1,1) is 1.

So in our sum over m from 0 to k, the term for m=0 is S(k,0) * ... which is zero for k >=1. So the m=0 term can be ignored. Because when k=0, but the problem says k >=1. Wait, the input constraints say 1 ≤ k ≤5000, so m ranges up to k. So for all valid k, the m=0 term contributes zero. So the sum starts effectively from m=1 to min(k, N).

Wait, but if k=0, which is not possible here, but in our case k is at least 1. So the sum for m starts from 1.

So the formula becomes sum_{m=1}^k S(k, m) * m! * C(N, m) * 2^{N -m}.

So the steps are:

- Compute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for m from 0 to k.

But since m starts from 1, perhaps we can compute only up to m=k. But for that, we need to precompute S(k, m) for all m up to k.

The Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using dynamic programming. The recurrence is S(n, m) = m * S(n-1, m) + S(n-1, m-1), with base cases S(0,0) = 1, S(n,0) = 0 for n>0, S(0, m) =0 for m>0.

So for a given k, we can compute a 2D array of S(k, m) up to m=k. Since k is up to 5000, this would take O(k^2) time, which is manageable (since 5000^2 is 25 million operations).

Once we have the Stirling numbers, for each m from 1 to k, compute the term:

term_m = S(k, m) * m! * C(N, m) * 2^{N -m}

Sum all term_m for m from 1 to k.

So the problem now is to compute each of these components.

Let's break down each part.

1. Compute Stirling numbers S(k, m): As mentioned, using DP.

2. Compute m! for m up to k. Since k can be 5000, m! can be up to 5000! which is a very large number, but since we are working modulo 1e9+7, we can compute factorials modulo MOD (where MOD is 1e9+7). However, note that in the term m! * C(N, m), C(N, m) is the combination N choose m. Let's see:

C(N, m) is (N*(N-1)*...*(N-m+1))/(m!). So when multiplied by m!, the m! cancels, leaving N*(N-1)*...*(N-m+1) = product_{i=0 to m-1} (N -i). So the term m! * C(N, m) is equal to this product. But since we're working modulo MOD (a prime, since 1e9+7 is a prime), we can compute this product modulo MOD.

Wait, but how?

Because C(N, m) = N * (N-1) * ... * (N - m +1) / m! So m! * C(N, m) = N * (N-1) * ... * (N - m +1). So the product is the product of m consecutive terms starting from N down to N -m +1.

So for a given m, this product is P(m) = N*(N-1)*...*(N -m +1).

So the term m! * C(N, m) is equal to P(m). So, for each m, we can compute P(m) as product_{i=0 to m-1} (N -i) mod MOD.

But N can be up to 1e9, but m is up to 5000, so for each m, this product can be computed in O(m) time. So for all m up to 5000, this is manageable.

So, the steps are:

For each m from 1 to k:

term_m = S(k, m) * P(m) * (2^(N -m)) mod MOD

Sum all term_m.

So putting this together, the steps are:

1. Precompute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for all m from 0 to k. But since m starts from 1, perhaps we can compute up to m=k.

2. Precompute factorials mod MOD (but perhaps not needed, since the m! is canceled by the combination in the term).

3. For each m from 1 to k:

   a. Compute P(m) = product_{i=0 to m-1} (N - i) mod MOD. For example, when m=3, P(3) = N * (N-1) * (N-2).

   b. Compute 2^{N -m} mod MOD. Since N can be up to 1e9, this can be done with fast exponentiation.

   c. Multiply S(k, m) * P(m) * (2^{N -m}) mod MOD and add to the sum.

Now, the challenge is to compute P(m) efficiently. For each m, since m can be up to 5000, and for each m, we can compute the product step by step. For example, for m=1, P(1) = N. For m=2, P(2) = N*(N-1), etc. Each step takes O(m) time for all m up to 5000, which is O(k^2) time. But k is up to 5e3, so 5e3^2 is 25e6 operations. That's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can precompute all P(m) for m from 1 to k in O(k) time by iterating m from 1 to k and keeping track of the product.

Wait, yes. Let's see:

Initialize P[0] = 1 (but m starts at 1). For m from 1 to k:

P[m] = P[m-1] * (N - (m-1)) mod MOD

Because for m=1, P[1] = N (since (N -0) = N). For m=2, P[2] = P[1] * (N-1) = N*(N-1), etc. Exactly what's needed.

So this can be done in O(k) time.

So the steps are:

Compute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for all m up to k.

Compute P[m] for m up to k using the product approach.

Compute 2^{N - m} mod MOD for each m from 1 to k. Wait, but N can be up to 1e9, and m up to 5e3. For each m, N -m can be up to 1e9 -1. So 2^(N -m) mod MOD can be computed using pow(2, (N -m), MOD). However, since N can be up to 1e9, and m up to 5e3, each exponent is up to 1e9. For each m, this pow can be computed in O(log exponent) time. Since k is up to 5e3, this would be O(k log MOD) steps, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, note that 2^(N -m) = 2^N / 2^m. But 2^m can be precomputed. So compute 2^N mod MOD, then compute 2^{-m} mod MOD for each m. Then 2^{N -m} mod MOD is (2^N mod MOD) * (2^{-m} mod MOD) mod MOD.

But 2^{-m} mod MOD is the modular inverse of 2^m mod MOD. So if we precompute the inverses of 2^m, that could be efficient.

Alternatively, precompute 2^m for m up to 5e3, then compute 2^N mod MOD once. Then for each m, compute 2^{N -m} mod MOD as (pow_2_N * inv_pow_2m) mod MOD.

So let's see:

pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD)

precompute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)

precompute inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2^m mod MOD. Which can be done as inv_2_pows[0] = 1, inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2_pows[m-1] * inv_2 mod MOD.

Then, 2^{N -m} mod MOD = (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m]) mod MOD.

But wait, 2^{N} / 2^m = 2^{N -m}, and since MOD is a prime, division is multiplication by inverse. So yes.

So precomputing inv_2_pows up to m=k would be O(k) steps, and then each term can be computed as (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m]) mod MOD.

This would be more efficient than computing pow(2, N -m) for each m, especially for large k. Because for each m, we would compute inv_2^m once and multiply by pow_2_N.

So steps for this part:

Compute pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD)

Compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)

Compute inv_2_pows[m] for m from 0 to k. inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2^m mod MOD.

Then, 2^{N -m} = pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m] mod MOD.

But wait, 2^{N -m} = (2^N) * (2^{-m}) mod MOD.

Yes, that's correct.

So this approach would allow us to compute all required 2^{N -m} terms in O(k) time after precomputing inv_2_pows.

So combining all this:

The algorithm would proceed as follows:

1. Precompute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for 0 <= m <=k.

2. Precompute the product P[m] for 1<= m <=k: P[m] = product_{i=0 to m-1} (N -i) mod MOD.

3. Precompute pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD).

4. Precompute inv_2_pows[m] for 0<= m <=k, where inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2^m mod MOD.

5. For each m from 1 to k:

   a. term = S(k, m) * P[m] mod MOD.

   b. term = term * (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m] mod MOD) mod MOD.

   c. add this term to the sum.

6. The sum is the required answer mod MOD.

Now, let's check for possible issues.

But what if N is smaller than m? For example, m=5, but N=3. Then C(N, m) is zero, and P[m] would be zero, so the term contributes zero. So in the loop for m from 1 to k, when m > N, P[m] is zero (since for m > N, the product would have a term N - (m-1) <= N - (N) + (1) =1 - (m-1 - N +1) = but if m > N, then for i up to m-1 >= N, there's a term N - (m-1) = negative, but when m > N, then N - i becomes N - (m-1) = N - (i) where i is up to m-1. Wait, when m > N, then for m >=1, when m= N+1, the product would include N - (N) =0. So P[m] would be zero. So for m> N, the term is zero, so those m can be skipped. But since N can be up to 1e9, and m up to 5e3, but for m up to 5e3, N is >=5e3 in most cases, except when N is small. So in code, we can proceed normally, as P[m] will be zero for m >N, so those terms can be ignored.

So, the code can proceed as written.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample input.

Sample input 1: N=1, k=1.

Then, the sum is sum_{m=1}^1 S(1, m) * P(m) * 2^{1 -m}.

Compute S(1,1) =1.

P(1) =1 (since product is N -0 =1).

2^{1-1} =1. So term is 1 * 1 * 1 =1. Sum is 1. Which matches the sample.

Sample input 2: N=3, k=2.

Compute sum for m=1 and m=2.

S(2,1) =1 (ways to partition 2 elements into 1 subset: 1).

S(2,2) =1 (partition into 2 subsets: each element is a subset).

For m=1:

P(1) =3.

2^{3-1}=4.

term = 1 *3 *4=12.

For m=2:

P(2) =3*2=6.

2^{3-2}=2.

term=1 *6*2=12.

Sum is 12+12=24, which matches the sample.

So the approach works for the sample.

Now, the code.

First, compute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for 0<=m<=k.

But since k can be up to 5e3, a 2D array is feasible.

We can use a DP table where dp[i][j] is S(i, j).

But since k is up to 5e3, and for each i up to k, j up to i, this would require O(k^2) space and time. Which is manageable.

But since we only need S(k, m) for the given k, not all up to k, perhaps we can optimize. But no, the problem gives us a specific k. So the code will compute Stirling numbers for the given k.

Wait, the problem's input is N and k. So for the given k, we need to compute S(k, m) for m from 0 to k.

Yes. So the code will build a DP table for S(k, m).

Wait, but the DP approach for S(n, m) requires building up the table for all n up to k. So for a given k, we can compute S(k, m) using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents S(i, j) for i up to k, j up to i. But for k up to 5e3, the time and space are manageable. However, the space is O(k^2) which for 5e3 is 25 million entries. But in Python, even that might be tight for memory. So perhaps we can optimize space by using a 1D array and updating in place.

Alternatively, for each row i from 1 to k, compute the current row based on the previous row.

Yes. Let's see: the recurrence is S(i, j) = j * S(i-1, j) + S(i-1, j-1).

So for each i, we need the previous row's values. So we can represent the DP with a 2D array, but for space optimization, use a 1D array and update from the end to the beginning.

Alternatively, since for each i, the j can be up to i. So for k=5e3, the maximum j is 5e3.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Initialize a 2D array stirling with dimensions (k+1) x (k+1). But since for each i, j can be up to i, but for our purpose, we need to compute S(k, m) for m up to k.

But in code, it's easier to compute a 2D array where stirling[i][j] is S(i, j).

Initialize stirling[0][0] =1.

For i from 1 to k:

   for j from 1 to i:

       stirling[i][j] = (j * stirling[i-1][j] + stirling[i-1][j-1]) % MOD

But MOD is 1e9+7. Wait, but Stirling numbers can be very large. So taking mod at each step is necessary.

Yes. So in the code, each time we compute a stirling[i][j], we take mod MOD.

But what's the maximum possible value of S(k, m)? For m up to 5e3 and k up to 5e3, the numbers can be large, but modulo 1e9+7 will keep them manageable.

So the code for Stirling numbers is feasible.

Once we have the Stirling numbers, compute P[m] as the product from N down to N -m +1, modulo MOD.

But since N can be up to 1e9, and m up to 5e3, how to compute P[m]?

As discussed, P[m] is computed as P[m] = P[m-1] * (N - (m-1)) mod MOD, with P[0] =1. Then for m=1, P[1] = N mod MOD, etc.

But since N can be up to 1e9, but mod is 1e9+7, the code can compute (N -i) mod MOD, for each i from 0 to m-1.

Wait, but for each m, the product is (N) * (N-1) * ... * (N - m +1) mod MOD.

So for each term in the product, (N -i) mod MOD can be computed as (N % MOD - i) mod MOD. Because N can be up to 1e9, but MOD is 1e9+7, so N mod MOD is N (since N is less than MOD). Wait, no: N can be up to 1e9, which is less than 1e9+7. So N mod MOD is N itself.

So, for example, N=1e9, mod is 1e9+7. Then N mod MOD is 1e9.

But when m is up to 5e3, and for each term in the product, we subtract 0, 1, ..., m-1. So (N -i) mod MOD can be computed as (N -i) % MOD. But since N can be up to 1e9, which is less than MOD, (N -i) can be negative if i > N. For example, if N is 3 and i=4, then (3-4) is -1, which mod MOD is 1e9+6. But when multiplied into the product, even though the actual product would have (3-4) = -1, but mod MOD, it's 1e9+6. However, if m exceeds N, then the product will include a zero (when i = N), but N -i becomes zero. So for m > N, the product is zero.

But when m exceeds N, the product P[m] will be zero. So in code, for each m from 1 to k:

if m > N: P[m] =0

else: P[m] is the product of N * (N-1) ... (N -m+1) mod MOD.

But in code, even if m exceeds N, the code will compute the product correctly, because when m exceeds N, there exists an i in 0..m-1 where (N -i) becomes zero mod MOD (if N >=0). For example, if N=3 and m=4, then when i=3, (3-3) is zero. So the product will be zero.

So the code can proceed by computing P[m] as follows:

P = [0] * (k+1)

P[0] =1

for m in 1 to k:

   term = (N - (m-1)) % MOD

   P[m] = (P[m-1] * term) % MOD

So even when (N - (m-1)) is negative (if m-1 > N), the mod MOD will handle it. But if N is up to 1e9, then (N - (m-1)) can be negative only if m-1 > N. For example, N=3 and m=5: 3 -4 =-1. Then mod MOD becomes 1e9+6. But multiplying this into the product will not give zero. Wait, but when m exceeds N, the product will have a term where i is N, leading to zero.

Wait, no. For example, N=3, m=4:

The product is 3 * 2 * 1 * 0 =0. So when m exceeds N+1, the product becomes zero. So if m exceeds N, then P[m] is zero. But when m = N+1, the product would have (3-3) =0, so P[N+1] =0. So for m >N, the product is zero.

But when N is up to 1e9 and m up to 5e3, m is much smaller than N, so the product is non-zero. Except when N is small (like N=3, m=5), but in code, the product will correctly compute zero.

So the code can proceed with the current approach.

Next, compute pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD). For N up to 1e9, pow can compute this efficiently.

Then, compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).

Then precompute inv_2_pows[m] for m from 0 to k. inv_2_pows[0] =1. For each m >=1, inv_2_pows[m] = (inv_2_pows[m-1] * inv_2) % MOD.

So inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2^m mod MOD.

Then, for each m in 1..k:

term = (stirling[k][m] * P[m]) % MOD

pow_term = (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m]) % MOD

term = (term * pow_term) % MOD

sum += term

sum is modulo MOD each step.

So, putting all this into code.

Now, code steps:

Read N and k from input.

MOD = 10**9 +7

Compute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for 0<=m <=k.

Compute P[m] for 1<=m <=k.

Compute pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD)

Compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)

Compute inv_2_pows: a list where inv_2_pows[m] = inv_2^m mod MOD.

Initialize sum to 0.

For m in 1..k:

   if m >k: continue (but loop is up to k)

   s = stirling[k][m]

   p = P[m]

   pow_2_n_m = (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m]) % MOD

   term = (s * p) % MOD

   term = (term * pow_2_n_m) % MOD

   sum = (sum + term) % MOD

Output sum.

Now, the code needs to handle the Stirling numbers.

But for k=5000, a 2D array of size (5001) x (5001) would take about 25 million entries, which in Python could be memory-heavy. For example, each entry is a 4-byte integer, that's 100MB, but Python lists have more overhead. However, given the memory limit of 256MB, this might be manageable. Alternatively, we can optimize the space for the Stirling numbers by using two 1D arrays, since each row depends only on the previous row.

Let's try to optimize space for Stirling numbers.

The recurrence is:

stirling[i][j] = j * stirling[i-1][j] + stirling[i-1][j-1]

So to compute stirling[k][m], we can use a 1D array that represents the previous row, and update it for each i up to k.

Initialize prev_row as a list where prev_row[j] represents S(i-1, j).

For each i from 1 to k:

   curr_row = [0]*(i+1)  # since j ranges up to i.

   curr_row[0] =0

   for j in 1 to i:

       curr_row[j] = (j * prev_row[j] + prev_row[j-1]) % MOD

   prev_row = curr_row.copy()

At the end, prev_row will be S(k, j) for j from 0 to k.

But this approach for k=5e3 would require O(k) space, and each row is of size O(k). For k=5e3, each curr_row is 5e3 elements, and there are 5e3 iterations. So total space is O(k^2), same as the 2D approach.

But in Python, using a list of lists may not be efficient. Alternatively, using two 1D arrays and updating them in a way that reuses space.

Wait, here's a better approach: since each row i is built from the row i-1, and for j in 1..i, the current row j can be computed as j * prev_row[j] + prev_row[j-1]. So the previous row must have entries up to j=i-1. So for row i, we can build it in reverse order, so that we don't overwrite the prev_row entries before they are used.

Wait, no. Let's think: prev_row is the row i-1. For curr_row[j], we need prev_row[j] and prev_row[j-1]. So if we compute j in increasing order, then prev_row[j] and prev_row[j-1] are available. However, if we use a single array and try to update in place, this may not work. But with two arrays, it's manageable.

Alternatively, for each i from 1 to k, the current row i can be built from the previous row (i-1). So for each i, the current row has j from 0 to i. For j>i-1, the previous row doesn't have j entries. So to build the current row, we can start with a list of size i+1, initialized to zero. Then for each j from 1 to i:

   if j <= i-1: term1 = j * prev_row[j]

   else: term1=0 (since j> i-1, prev_row[j] is out of bounds)

   term2 = prev_row[j-1] if j-1 <=i-1 else 0

   curr_row[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD

But when i increases by 1 each time, for j up to i, the prev_row has j up to i-1. So for j=i, term1 is i * prev_row[i], which is zero since prev_row is of size i (0..i-1). So for j=i, term1 is zero. term2 is prev_row[i-1], which is S(i-1, i-1) =1. So S(i, i) = 1.

So in code, for each i, the current row has j from 0 to i. For j=0, it's zero (since i>0). For j=1 to i:

   curr_row[j] = (j * prev_row[j] if j < len(prev_row) else 0) + (prev_row[j-1] if j-1 < len(prev_row) else 0) 

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the initial approach of building a 2D array may be manageable for k up to 5e3.

But in Python, creating a list of lists for k=5e3 is possible, but requires 5e3+1 lists, each of varying lengths. Let's see:

For i from 0 to k, stirling[i] is a list of i+1 elements.

The total memory is sum_{i=0 to k} (i+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2. For k=5e3, this is about (5e3)^2 /2 = 12.5e6 elements. Each element is an integer (in Python, ints are objects with some overhead, but in practice, it's manageable).

But perhaps using a 2D list of lists is not efficient. An alternative is to use a single list for the current row and update it as we go.

Let's think of using a dynamic programming approach with a single list, updating it for each row.

Initialize prev_row = [1] (the row for i=0).

For i from 1 to k:

   curr_row = [0]*(i+1)

   curr_row[0] =0

   curr_row[1] =1 (if i==1)

   for j in range(1, i+1):

       if j > len(prev_row):

           term1 =0

       else:

           term1 = j * prev_row[j]

       if j-1 >= len(prev_row):

           term2 =0

       else:

           term2 = prev_row[j-1]

       curr_row[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD

   prev_row = curr_row

Wait, but this approach has issues. For example, when i=2:

prev_row is [0, 1] (from i=1, j=0 and j=1).

For i=2:

curr_row has length 3 (indices 0,1,2).

j ranges from 1 to 2.

For j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1] =1*1=1.

term2=prev_row[0] =0.

so curr_row[1] =1.

For j=2:

term1=2 * prev_row[2], but prev_row has only length 2 (indices 0 and 1), so term1=0.

term2=prev_row[1] =1.

so curr_row[2] =1.

Which is correct (S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1). Wait no. Wait, S(2,1) should be 1 (the number of ways to partition 2 elements into 1 subset), S(2,2)=1. But according to the code, for i=2 (which is k=2?), no, the code is building up for each i from 1 to k. So for k=2, the code would build i=1 and i=2.

But in any case, this approach may not work correctly. Let me test for i=1 and i=2.

Wait, for i=0, prev_row is [1].

i=1:

curr_row is [0, 0] (indices 0 and 1).

j ranges from 1 to 1.

j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1], but prev_row is [1], which has length 1 (indices 0). So prev_row[1] is out of bounds. So term1 =0.

term2 = prev_row[0] =1.

so curr_row[1] = 0 +1 =1.

prev_row becomes [0, 1].

i=2:

curr_row has length 3.

j ranges from 1 to 2.

j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1] =1*1=1.

term2=prev_row[0]=0.

curr_row[1] =1.

j=2:

term1=2 * prev_row[2], which is out of bounds (prev_row is [0,1] of length 2). So term1=0.

term2 = prev_row[1] =1.

curr_row[2] =1.

So S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1. Which is correct.

i=3:

prev_row is [0,1,1].

j ranges from 1 to3.

For j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1] =1*1=1.

term2=prev_row[0] =0.

curr_row[1] =1.

j=2:

term1=2 * prev_row[2] =2*1=2.

term2=prev_row[1] =1.

curr_row[2] =3.

j=3:

term1=3*prev_row[3] which is out of bounds (prev_row length is 3). term1=0.

term2=prev_row[2] =1.

curr_row[3] =1.

So S(3,1)=1? Wait, no. S(3,1) is 1 (only one way to partition 3 elements into 1 subset). S(3,2) is 3. S(3,3)=1. Yes.

So this approach works.

Thus, the code can use a dynamic programming approach where we only track the previous row and build the current row. Each row is stored as a list, and for each i, the list has j from 0 to i. This way, the space is O(k) for each row, and since we only keep the previous row, the total space is O(k) (since the previous row's size is O(k)).

Wait, no. For each i, the current row is i+1 elements. So for k=5e3, the final row will have 5e3+1 elements, and the previous row will have 5e3 elements. So the space for the two rows is O(k). But in Python, lists have some overhead, but it's manageable.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Initialize prev_row as [1] (S(0,0)=1).

for i in range(1, k+1):

   curr_row = [0]*(i+1)

   for j in range(1, i+1):

       term1 = 0

       if j < len(prev_row):

           term1 = j * prev_row[j]

       term2 = 0

       if j-1 < len(prev_row):

           term2 = prev_row[j-1]

       curr_row[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD

   prev_row = curr_row

At the end, prev_row will be the row for i=k. Then, S(k, m) is prev_row[m].

But wait, for i=0, prev_row is [1], which is correct. For i=1, we compute the row for i=1.

This approach seems correct.

So the code for Stirling numbers is:

prev_row = [1]

for i in range(1, k+1):

    curr_row = [0]*(i+1)

    for j in range(1, i+1):

        term1 = j * (prev_row[j] if j < len(prev_row) else 0)

        term2 = prev_row[j-1] if (j-1) < len(prev_row) else 0

        curr_row[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD

    prev_row = curr_row

stirling = prev_row

Then, S(k, m) is stirling[m], since for the row i=k, the indices j are from 0 to k.

Yes.

So, for example, for k=2, stirling is [0, 1, 1], which corresponds to S(2, 0)=0, S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1.

But wait, the code for i=2, after the loop:

prev_row is curr_row for i=2, which is [0, 1, 1].

But according to the code, for i=2, j ranges from 1 to 2.

For j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1] (prev_row is [0, 1] from i=1's loop).

term1 is 1*1=1.

term2 = prev_row[0] =0.

curr_row[1] =1.

For j=2:

term1 =2 * prev_row[2] (prev_row has length 2, so j=2 is out of range, term1=0).

term2 = prev_row[1] =1.

curr_row[2] =0+1=1.

Thus, curr_row for i=2 is [0,1,1].

So stirling[1] is 1 (S(2,1)), and stirling[2] is 1 (S(2,2)).

Which is correct.

Thus, the code for Stirling numbers works.

Now, the code can proceed.

Testing this code with the sample input.

Sample input 2: N=3, k=2.

Stirling numbers for k=2: S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1.

P[1] =3 mod MOD.

P[2] =3*2=6 mod MOD.

pow_2_N=8 (2^3=8).

inv_2 = 500000004 (mod 1e9+7).

inv_2_pows[1] =500000004.

inv_2_pows[2] = (500000004)^2 mod MOD = 250000002.

For m=1:

term_stir =1.

term_p =3.

pow_term =8 * inv_2_pows[1] mod MOD =8 * 500,000,004 mod MOD = (8 * 500,000,004) mod 1e9+7. 500,000,004 *8 is 4,000,000,032 mod 1e9+7 is 4,000,000,032 - 3*(1e9+7) =4,000,000,032 - 3,000,000,021=1,000,000,011. Which mod 1e9+7 is 4 (since 1e9+7 *0.99999...). Wait, perhaps I should compute it directly:

8 * 500000004 = 4,000,000,032. 1e9+7 is 1,000,000,007.

4,000,000,032 divided by 1e9+7 is 3 times 1e9+7 is 3,000,000,021. Subtract that from 4,000,000,032 to get 1,000,000,011. Now, 1e9+7 is 1,000,000,007. So 1,000,000,011 - 1,000,000,007 =4. So 8 * inv_2_pows[1] mod MOD is4.

So pow_term for m=1 is 4.

term =1 *3 *4 =12.

For m=2:

term_stir=1.

term_p=6.

pow_term=8 * inv_2_pows[2] =8 * 250000002 mod MOD.

250000002 *8 =2,000,000,016.

MOD is 1e9+7. 2e9+14 (but wait, 1e9+7 *2 is 2e9+14? No: 1e9+7 is 1,000,000,007. 2*1e9+7 is 2,000,000,014.

2,000,000,016 -2,000,000,014=2. So 2,000,000,016 mod MOD is 2.

So pow_term is 2.

term=1 *6 *2=12.

sum is 12+12=24.

Which is correct.

So the code works.

Now, putting all together.

Now, code in Python:

But for very large k (5000), building the stirling numbers may take some time. But given that the time limit is 2 seconds, and Python is efficient enough for 5e3 iterations with loops, it should be manageable.

Now, let's write the code.

But wait, when k=0, but the input constraints say k >=1. So the code can assume that k is at least 1.

So the code:

Read N and k.

MOD = 10**9+7

Compute the Stirling numbers.

Compute P[m] for m from 1 to k.

Compute pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD)

Compute inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)

Compute inv_2_pows as a list from 0 to k.

Then, sum all terms.

Now, code:

MOD = 10**9+7

N, k = map(int, input().split())

# Compute Stirling numbers S(k, m) for m from 0 to k.
prev_row = [1]  # i=0
for i in range(1, k+1):
    curr_row = [0]*(i+1)
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        term1 = j * (prev_row[j] if j < len(prev_row) else 0)
        term2 = prev_row[j-1] if (j-1) < len(prev_row) else 0
        curr_row[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD
    prev_row = curr_row

stirling_k = prev_row  # S(k, m) is stirling_k[m] for m in 0..k

# Compute P[m] for m from 1 to k.
P = [0]*(k+1)
P[0] = 1
for m in range(1, k+1):
    term = (N - (m-1)) % MOD
    P[m] = (P[m-1] * term) % MOD

# Compute pow_2_N and inv_2_pows
pow_2_N = pow(2, N, MOD)
inv_2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)
inv_2_pows = [1]*(k+1)
for m in range(1, k+1):
    inv_2_pows[m] = (inv_2_pows[m-1] * inv_2) % MOD

# Compute the sum
result = 0
for m in range(1, k+1):
    s = stirling_k[m]
    p = P[m]
    pow_term = (pow_2_N * inv_2_pows[m]) % MOD
    term = (s * p) % MOD
    term = (term * pow_term) % MOD
    result = (result + term) % MOD

print(result)

Now, let's test the code with the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

1 1

Stirling numbers for k=1:

prev_row starts as [1].

For i=1:

curr_row has length 2.

j=1:

term1 =1 * prev_row[1] (prev_row is [1], so j=1 >= len(prev_row) (1). So term1 is 0.

term2 = prev_row[0] =1.

curr_row[1] =1.

So stirling_k is [0,1].

Then P[1] = (1-0) mod MOD =1.

pow_2_N is 2^1 mod MOD=2.

inv_2_pows[1] is 500000004.

pow_term for m=1: 2 * 500000004 mod MOD = (2 * 500,000,004) mod 1e9+7.

Which is 1,000,000,008 mod 1e9+7 = 1.

So term is 1 *1 *1 =1. Output is 1.

Sample input 2:

3 2.

Stirling numbers for k=2 are [0,1,1].

P[1]=3, P[2]=3*2=6.

pow_2_N is 8.

inv_2_pows[1] is 500,000,004, which is 8 * 500,000,004 mod MOD is 4.

inv_2_pows[2] is (500,000,004)^2 mod MOD = 250,000,002. 8 * 250,000,002 = 2,000,000,016 mod MOD is 2.

term for m=1:1 *3 *4=12.

m=2:1 *6 *2=12. sum 24.

So the code works.

This should handle all test cases correctly.
