Okay, let's see. The problem is about making the array good by removing the minimum number of elements. A good array can be split into subsequences of [4,8,15,16,23,42] in order. So each subsequence must have these elements in the exact order, but not necessarily contiguous. And the array's length has to be a multiple of 6.

Hmm, how to model this? The key is to track how many complete subsequences we can form. For each element in the array, we need to know if it can contribute to building a valid subsequence step by step.

Let's think about the order. Each subsequence is built in the order 4 â†’ 8 â†’ 15 â†’ 16 â†’ 23 â†’ 42. So, for each element in the array, we can track how many partial sequences are at each stage. For example, when we see a 4, it can start a new subsequence. Then, an 8 can convert a 4 into the next stage, and so on.

So maybe we can use a count array where count[i] represents the number of partial subsequences that are waiting for the (i+1)-th element. The order is important here. Let's index the elements as follows:

0: 4
1: 8
2:15
3:16
4:23
5:42

So for each element in the array, we check which index it is. Then, for that index, if there's a count in the previous index, we decrement that and increment the current index's count. Otherwise, this element cannot be part of a valid subsequence and must be removed.

Wait, here's the idea. Let's have a counts array of size 5 (since after 4, we need 8, then 15, etc.). So counts[0] is the number of 4s waiting for 8. counts[1] is the number of 4â†’8 sequences waiting for 15, and so on. counts[5] would be the completed sequences.

Wait, maybe indexes 0 to 5. Let me think:

- For a 4, we can increment counts[0].
- For an 8, we check if counts[0] > 0. If yes, decrement counts[0] and increment counts[1].
- For a 15, check counts[1], decrement, increment counts[2], etc.
- For 42 (index 5), check counts[4], decrement, and add to counts[5], which represents the number of completed sequences.

At the end, the number of completed sequences is counts[5], which multiplied by 6 gives the length of the good array. The minimum elements to remove is n - (counts[5] *6).

Yes! So the approach is to process each element in order, and for each element, see if it can advance a partial subsequence. If not, it's removed.

So the steps are:

1. Initialize a counts array of size 6, all zeros. But wait, counts[5] is for completed sequences, and the other counts are for the steps before.

Wait, maybe the counts array has indices 0 to 5, where each index represents the next expected element. For example, counts[0] is the number of subsequences that are waiting for a 4. Wait, no, maybe the counts are for how many subsequences have been built up to each step. For example:

counts[0] = number of 4's that are available (start of a subsequence)
counts[1] = number of 4â†’8 sequences waiting for 15
counts[2] = number of 4â†’8â†’15 sequences waiting for 16
counts[3] = ... waiting for 23
counts[4] = ... waiting for 42
counts[5] = completed subsequences (so when we reach 42, we add to counts[5])

Wait, but once a subsequence is completed (counts[5] increments), those are done and can't be modified. So for each element in the array, we check which step it is (like 4 is step 0, 8 step 1, etc.), then:

If the element is 4 (step 0), we can add to counts[0].
If it's step k (where k >=1), we check if counts[k-1] is >0. If yes, subtract 1 from counts[k-1], add 1 to counts[k]. For step 5 (42), adding to counts[5] means a complete subsequence.

So during processing each element, we need to determine which step it is. For example, the element 8 corresponds to step 1. So when we process an 8, we look at counts[0]. If there's any available, we take one from counts[0], add to counts[1].

If there's no available in the previous step, this element can't be used and is skipped (counted as removed).

So, let's process each element in order. For each element:

- Find its step (0-5). For example, 4 is 0, 8 is 1, etc.
- If the step is 0: increment counts[0].
- Else: check if counts[step-1] >0. If yes, subtract 1 from counts[step-1], add 1 to counts[step]. Else, skip this element (add to removed count).
- For step 5, each time you add to counts[5], you have a complete subsequence.

At the end, the total valid elements is counts[5] *6. The number of elements to remove is n - (counts[5] *6).

Yes, this seems correct. Let's test the examples.

First example:

Input: 5 elements [4,8,15,16,23]. The steps for each are 0,1,2,3,4.

Processing:

4: counts[0] becomes 1.
8: counts[0] is 1, so counts[1] becomes 1, counts[0] 0.
15: counts[1] is 1, so counts[2] becomes 1.
16: counts[2] is 1 â†’ counts[3] becomes 1.
23: counts[3] is 1 â†’ counts[4] becomes 1.
No 42, so counts[5] is 0. So the total valid is 0*6=0. So all 5 elements are removed. Which matches the first example.

Second example:

12 elements. The output is 0, meaning the array is already good.

Processing:

Each subsequence is properly formed. So all 12 elements are used in two sequences. So counts[5] would be 2. 2*6=12. So no removal.

Third example:

15 elements. Output is 3. So 15-3=12 elements, which is 2*6=12.

So the algorithm should correctly compute counts[5] as 2, leading to 12 elements, hence 3 removed.

So this approach should work.

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum n is 5e5. So the algorithm must be O(n) time and O(1) space, which it is. The counts array is size 6, so O(1) space. Each element is processed once, so O(n) time.

So the implementation steps:

- Preprocess the mapping of each element to its step. For example, 4 â†’0, 8â†’1, etc. We can create a dictionary for this.

- Initialize counts = [0] *6. But counts[5] is the completed count.

Wait, no. Wait, counts[5] would be the number of completed subsequences, but in the code, perhaps the counts array is indices 0-5, where each index represents the step. So for example, when a 42 is processed (step 5), we check counts[4] >0. If yes, decrement counts[4], increment counts[5], which is the completed count.

Yes. So in code:

element_steps = {4:0, 8:1, 15:2, 16:3, 23:4, 42:5}

Then, for each num in the array:

step = element_steps[num]

if step ==0:

   counts[0] +=1

else:

   if counts[step-1] >0:

       counts[step-1] -=1

       counts[step] +=1

   else:

       # this element is skipped (removed)

       pass

But wait, for step 5 (42), when you increment counts[5], that's the total number of completed sequences.

Wait, no. Because when you process a 42 (step 5), you check counts[4] (which is the step 4, waiting for 42). So if counts[4] is >0, subtract one from counts[4], and add to counts[5]. So counts[5] is the number of completed sequences.

So at the end, the answer is n - (counts[5] *6).

Yes.

So the code would look something like this:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    arr = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    step_map = {4:0, 8:1, 15:2, 16:3, 23:4, 42:5}

    counts = [0]*6

    for num in arr:

        s = step_map[num]

        if s ==0:

            counts[0] +=1

        else:

            if counts[s-1] >0:

                counts[s-1] -=1

                counts[s] +=1

    # The number of valid elements is counts[5] *6

    removals = n - (counts[5] *6)

    print(removals, file=output_stream)

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')

Testing against sample input 2.

    counts = [0]*6

    for num in arr:

        if s ==0:

            counts[0] +=1

                counts[s] +=1

    # The number of valid elements is counts[5] *6

    removals = n - (counts[5] *6)

    print(removals, file=output_stream)



def test():

    TEST_CASES = [
        {

        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Third example:

Input is 15 elements, output 3.

After processing, counts[5] is 2. 2*6=12 â†’ removals 15-12=3. Correct.

So the code works for the examples.

Now, edge cases. Like empty array. If n=0, then counts[5] is 0, so 0-0=0. Which is correct (it's a good array).

Another case: all elements are 4. For example, n=5 elements 4,4,4,4,4. Then counts[0] is 5. The other steps can't proceed. So counts[5] is 0. So removals 5-0=5. Which is correct, as the array must be empty (since no sequences can be formed).

Another case: one full sequence. Then counts[5] is 1. So removals n-6, if there are no other elements. Suppose n=6, all elements in order. Then counts[5] is 1. So no removals. Correct.

So this approach works.

Now, the code is O(n) time and O(1) space, which is acceptable for 5e5 elements.

Potential optimizations: since the step_map is fixed, using a dictionary is okay, but perhaps a list or a precomputed mapping via a list or if-else statements could be faster. But in Python, dictionaries are fast for small keys, and for 5e5 elements, this is manageable.

So the code should work.

Thus, the final code is as written.

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
step = {4:0, 8:1, 15:2, 16:3, 23:4, 42:5}
counts = [0] * 6
for num in a:
    s = step[num]
    if s == 0:
        counts[0] += 1
    else:
        if counts[s-1] > 0:
            counts[s-1] -= 1
            counts[s] += 1
print(n - counts[5] * 6)
```
