Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to count the number of funny pairs (l, r) where the subarray from l to r has even length. And for such a pair, the XOR of the left half must equal the XOR of the right half. Hmm.

First, I need to understand what defines a funny pair. Let's think: for a pair (l, r), the length is even, so r-l+1 is even. So the mid point is (l + r-1)/2. That means the subarray is split into two equal parts. The left half is from l to mid, and the right half is mid+1 to r. Each half has length (r - l + 1)/2.

The key condition is that the XOR of the left half equals the XOR of the right half. Let's denote the XOR of a segment from i to j as xor(i,j). So for a funny pair (l, r), we need xor(l, mid) = xor(mid+1, r).

But how can we compute this efficiently for all possible pairs? Because checking each possible (l, r) directly would be O(n^2), which is way too slow for n up to 3e5.

Let's think about properties of XOR. The XOR of a range can be calculated using a prefix XOR array. Let's denote prefix_xor[0] = 0, and prefix_xor[i] = a_1 XOR a_2 ... XOR a_i. Then xor(l, r) is prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[l-1].

So for the left half (l to mid), the XOR is prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[l-1]. For the right half (mid+1 to r), it's prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[mid]. The condition is that these two are equal.

So setting the two equal:

prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[mid]

If we XOR both sides with prefix_xor[mid], we get:

prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[mid] → which is prefix_xor[r].

Wait, because XOR is associative and commutative. Let's see:

Left side: (prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[l-1]) XOR (prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[r]) = 0.

Wait, maybe rearranging the equation. Let's take the equation:

prefix_xor[mid] XOR prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[mid].

If we XOR both sides with prefix_xor[mid], we get:

prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r].

Ah right! Because (a XOR b) XOR b = a. So when we XOR both sides with prefix_xor[mid], the left side becomes prefix_xor[l-1], and the right side is prefix_xor[r]. So the condition simplifies to prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r].

So the key condition is that the prefix XOR at l-1 is equal to the prefix XOR at r.

But wait, what about the mid here? Because mid is (l + r -1)/2. Let's see, for the pair (l, r), the length is even. Let's let k be the length of each half. So the total length is 2k. So mid is l + k - 1. Because l to mid is k elements, mid+1 to r is also k elements.

So the total length is 2k, so r = l + 2k -1. Then mid = l + k -1.

But how does that relate to the positions in the array? Well, perhaps there's a way to model the pairs (l, r) that satisfy prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r], and the length is even.

So for each r, we need to count the number of l's such that:

1. l <= r (since l <= r)
2. r - l + 1 is even → (r - l +1) mod 2 == 0 → (r - l) is odd → (r - l) = 2k -1 → wait no. Wait, the length is even. So r - l +1 is even → (r - l +1) = 2k. So l can be written as r - 2k +1. But k can vary from 1 to (r - l +1)/2.

Alternatively, the even length implies that (r - l +1) is even. So for a given r, the possible l's are such that l <= r and (r - l +1) is even. So l must be r - t, where t is an even number minus 1. Wait, maybe it's easier to note that l and r have to be such that (r - l +1) is even. So (r - l +1) is even → r - l +1 = 2k → l = r - 2k +1. So k can be 1 up to (r - l +1)/2.

But this might not directly help. Let's think again about the condition.

The key condition is prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r], and the length (r-l+1) is even.

But how do we model this? For each r, we can look for all l's where l-1 is <= r-1, and (r - l +1) is even. Also, prefix_xor[l-1] must equal prefix_xor[r].

But how can we efficiently find such l's for each r?

Another observation: since (r - l +1) is even, the length is even. Let's see, the length is (r - l +1) = 2k. So when you split into two halves, each has k elements. Then mid is l + k -1. So for a given r, the possible l's must be such that there exists a k where l + 2k -1 = r. Wait, because r = l + 2k -1. Then r - l +1 = 2k. So l = r - 2k +1. But k can be any integer such that l >=1 and r <=n.

Alternatively, the even length implies that (r - l +1) is even, which can be rewritten as (r - l) is odd. So (r - l) is an odd number. Therefore, l and r have different parities. For example, if r is even, then l must be odd (since even minus odd is odd), and vice versa.

Wait, yes! Let's see: (r - l) must be odd. So r and l must have different parity. Because if r is even and l is even, then even - even is even. So parity must differ. So for a given r, l must be of opposite parity. For example, if r is even (position 2,4,6 etc.), then l must be odd. Because even minus odd is odd. If r is odd, l must be even.

But l ranges from 1 to r. Wait, l can be 1-based. So for r (which is 1-based as well), l must be such that (r - l) is odd. Which implies that (r - l) mod 2 is 1. So (r - l) = 2m +1 for some integer m. So l = r - (2m+1). Then (r - l +1) = 2m+2 = 2(m+1), which is even. So the parity of l and r must be different.

So the key insight here is that for (l, r) to have even length, l and r must have opposite parities. So for each r, the l's that are valid are those with l-1 (since l-1 is the index in the prefix_xor) that have the same parity as r, but wait, let's think:

Wait, l can be 1-based. So l ranges from 1 to r. But for (r - l +1) to be even, the length is even. So (r - l) must be odd. Which means l and r must have different parity. For example, if r is even (like 4), then l must be odd (like 1,3), so that 4-1=3 (odd), 4-3=1 (odd). So for r even, l is odd. For r odd, l is even.

So, l must have parity different from r. So when we are considering prefix_xor[l-1] equals prefix_xor[r], then for each r, we can look at all previous prefix_xor values where the index (l-1) has the same parity as (r) (since l-1 would have parity (r's parity) -1 mod 2, because l and r have opposite parity. Let's see:

For example, if r is even (parity 0), then l must be odd (parity 1). So l-1 is even (parity 0). So (l-1) has parity 0, which is same as r's parity. Wait, no. Let's see:

r is even (like 4). l must be odd (like 3). Then l-1 is 2, which is even. So the parity of (l-1) is even (0), same as r's parity (0). So for r even, the l-1 is even. So, when r is even, the indices (l-1) that we are looking for are even. Similarly, if r is odd (like 5), then l must be even (like 2). Then l-1 is 1, which is odd. So (l-1) has parity 1, same as r's parity (5 is odd, parity 1). Wait, wait: r is 5 (odd parity), and (l-1) is 1 (odd parity). So in this case, (l-1) has the same parity as r. So the parity of (l-1) is equal to the parity of r.

So the conclusion is: for a pair (l, r) with even length, the indices (l-1) and r must have the same parity. Because:

If r is even → parity 0. Then l must be odd → l-1 is even → parity 0. So same as r's parity.

If r is odd → parity 1. Then l must be even → l-1 is odd → parity 1. So same as r's parity.

Thus, for each r, to find l's such that:

1. prefix_xor[l-1] == prefix_xor[r]
2. (l-1) and r have the same parity.

So the approach is to keep track, for each possible value of prefix_xor and parity, the number of times that combination has occurred before. Then, for each r, we look up how many times (prefix_xor[r], parity of r) has been seen before. Those counts will be the number of valid l's for this r.

So we can use a dictionary (hash map) where the keys are tuples (x, p), where x is the prefix_xor value, and p is the parity (0 or 1). The value stored is the count of how many times this combination has occurred.

We can initialize the map with the initial state: prefix_xor[0] = 0 (since prefix starts at 0), and its parity is 0 (since index 0 is even). So the initial count for (0, 0) is 1.

Then, for each i from 1 to n (since prefix_xor is 1-based?), wait, the prefix_xor array is 0-based. Let's clarify:

Assuming the array is a_1 to a_n. The prefix_xor array is:

prefix_xor[0] = 0

prefix_xor[1] = a_1

prefix_xor[2] = a_1 XOR a_2

...

prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] XOR a_i.

So for position r (the end of the subarray), which is the current index in the array (1-based), the prefix_xor[r] is the XOR up to a_r. So when processing the r-th element (1-based), we compute the current prefix_xor.

Then, for each r (1-based), we want to find all l's where (l-1) is in the prefix_xor array (so up to r-1), and prefix_xor[l-1] = prefix_xor[r], and the parity of (l-1) is equal to the parity of r. Because l-1 and r must have the same parity.

So for each step r (1-based), we compute the current parity of r (r mod 2). Then, we look up in the map the count of (prefix_xor[r], r mod 2). That count is the number of valid l's for this r.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize a dictionary, say, count_map, which starts with {(0,0): 1}.

Initialize the result as 0.

Initialize prefix_xor as 0.

Then, for each i from 1 to n (processing the i-th element in the array):

- Compute the current prefix_xor by XOR with a[i] (since the array is 0-based in code, but the input is given as a_1 to a_n, in code we can adjust indices).

Wait, in code, perhaps the array is 0-based in Python. So, for the first element (a_1 in the problem), we process it as index 0 in Python.

But when processing the i-th element (0-based), the current index in the problem's terms is i+1. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

The problem's input is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. In code, this is read as a list, which is 0-based. So the code's a[0] is a_1, a[1] is a_2, etc. So for the code's prefix_xor array, prefix_xor[i] is the XOR of a[0] to a[i-1], because:

prefix_xor[0] = 0

prefix_xor[1] = a[0]

prefix_xor[2] = a[0] XOR a[1]

etc.

Wait, perhaps the code's prefix_xor is computed as follows:

prefix = 0

for each num in the array:

    prefix ^= num

    ... store prefix ...

But then, the prefix array would be 1-based. Because after the first element, prefix is a_1, after the second, a_1 ^ a_2, etc.

Wait, the code's approach could be:

prefix = 0

count_map = defaultdict(int)

count_map[(prefix, 0)] = 1

result = 0

for i in range(n):

    prefix ^= a[i]

    current_parity = (i+1) % 2  # because r is (i+1) in problem terms?

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's reindex.

The problem's r is the end index (1-based). In code, after processing the i-th element (0-based in the array), the prefix_xor up to the i-th element is prefix, which corresponds to problem's prefix_xor[i+1], because the problem's prefix_xor[0] is 0, and problem's prefix_xor[1] is a_1 (code's a[0]), etc.

So for code's i-th element (array index 0), the problem's r is i+1. So the parity of r is (i+1) % 2.

Wait, but for the code's current r (problem's r is i+1), the parity is (i+1) % 2. So when processing the code's i-th element (array index i), the current prefix is problem's prefix_xor[i+1].

Then, for the current r (i+1), we need to look up in the count_map the number of times (prefix, (i+1) % 2) has occurred before.

But wait, the previous entries in the count_map are for positions l-1, which in problem's terms are from 0 to i.

So for the code's step i (array index i), the current problem's r is i+1.

So during processing the i-th array element (code's a[i], which is problem's a_{i+1}), the current prefix is problem's prefix_xor[i+1], and the parity is (i+1) % 2.

So the algorithm steps in code would be:

Initialize a dictionary count_map with { (0, 0): 1 }.

Initialize prefix = 0, which corresponds to problem's prefix_xor[0].

result = 0

for i in range(n):

    prefix ^= a[i]

    current_parity = (i + 1) % 2

    # current r is i+1, which has parity current_parity.

    # Look up (prefix, current_parity) in count_map.

    result += count_map.get( (prefix, current_parity), 0 )

    # Now, we need to add the current state to the count_map.

    # The current prefix is problem's prefix_xor[i+1], and its parity is (i+1) % 2.

    # So the next positions will be looking for (prefix, their parity) which is same as their r's parity.

    # Wait, the current prefix is for problem's prefix_xor[r], where r = i+1.

    # But when we add to the count_map, we are adding the current prefix and the parity of r (i+1), which is (i+1) % 2.

    # Because for future steps, when some r' comes, the l-1 for that r' would be this current r (i+1), which would need to have the same parity as r'.

    # So for each step, after processing the current prefix and adding to the result, we need to update the count_map with the current (prefix, current_parity).

    # Wait, no. Wait, the count_map is supposed to track the occurrence of prefix_xor values at positions l-1 (problem's terms) and their parities (which must match the current r's parity).

    # So when processing the current r (i+1), we look up the count_map for (current prefix, current_parity). Then, after that, we need to add the current prefix (which is the prefix up to r) and the parity of r to the count_map.

    # Because in future steps, when r' is being processed (say, j+1), the l-1 for that r' would be the current r (i+1), which has parity (i+1) % 2. So, the key in the count_map for that would be (prefix, (i+1) % 2).

    # So the steps are:

    # For current r (i+1):

    #   check how many times (prefix, r's parity) has been seen before (in previous positions l-1).

    #   add that count to result.

    #   then, add the current (prefix, r's parity) to the count_map.

    # Wait, no. Wait, the current prefix is for r (i+1), which is being added to the count_map. But the next steps will process larger r's, and for their l's, l-1 can be up to those r's. So the current r (i+1) becomes part of the possible l-1 for future r's.

    # So, the current prefix (prefix after processing a[i]) is prefix_xor[r], where r = i+1. So, when a future r' is processed (say j+1), then for that r', the l's that are valid are those where l-1 is <= j, and the parity of l-1 is equal to r' mod 2.

    # So, the current prefix (r = i+1) is added to the count_map with its parity (i+1 mod 2). Because in future steps, when r' is j+1, and l-1 is i+1 (so l is i+2), the parity of l-1 is (i+1) mod 2. For the pair (l, r'), which has even length, l and r' must have different parity. So l is i+2, which has parity (i+2) mod 2. r' is j+1. For their parity to be different, (i+2) and (j+1) must have different parities. But the parity of l-1 (i+1) must be equal to r' (j+1) mod 2.

    # So, the code should accumulate the current (prefix, parity) into the count_map after processing the current step's contribution to the result.

    # So, during iteration:

    # for each i in 0..n-1:

    #   compute prefix = XOR up to a[i] (so prefix is problem's prefix_xor[i+1])

    #   current_parity = (i+1) % 2

    #   add count_map.get( (prefix, current_parity), 0 ) to result

    #   then, update count_map by incrementing count_map[(prefix, current_parity)] by 1

    # Because when the next steps (j > i) process their elements, the current prefix (i+1) is part of the possible l-1 positions (for l-1 = i+1).

    # Wait, but in the problem, l-1 can be 0 to r-1. So when processing i+1, the possible l's for future r's will have l-1 up to j (for r' = j+1). So the current (prefix, parity) is added to the count_map so that future steps can check if their (prefix, parity) matches.

    # So the code's logic is correct: for each current r (i+1), find how many previous positions l-1 (0..i) had the same prefix and same parity as current r. Then add the current (prefix, parity) to the count_map for future steps.

    # Wait, no. Because the current r's parity is (i+1) mod 2. The l-1 for a future r' must have the same parity as r'. So when adding the current prefix (i+1) and its parity (i+1 mod 2) to the count_map, future r's (j+1) with parity (j+1 mod 2) will check if there are any entries in the count_map where the parity is (j+1 mod 2). So if the current parity is (i+1 mod 2), then when j+1 has the same parity, the entry is considered.

    # For example, suppose current r is 4 (i+1 =4, parity 0). Then in the count_map, we add (prefix_xor[4], 0). Then, for a future r' =6 (parity 0), when looking for l's, l-1 must be 4, and have parity 0. So yes, this entry would be considered.

    # So the code logic is correct.

    # So the code's steps are:

    # Initialize count_map with (0, 0) → 1, which is the prefix_xor[0] (problem's prefix_xor[0]) with parity 0 (since r=0 here, but perhaps it's handled as the initial state.

    # Then, for each element in the array:

    #   compute the new prefix (XOR with a[i])

    #   current_parity = (i+1) mod 2 → because r is i+1.

    #   add to the result the count of (prefix, current_parity) in the count_map.

    #   then, add (prefix, current_parity) to the count_map (increment by 1).

    # So this way, for each r (i+1), we count how many times the same prefix and same parity have occurred before. Each occurrence corresponds to a valid l-1, which gives a valid l (l = (l-1) +1) where (l, r) is a funny pair.

    # That makes sense. So the code would be:

    # Read n.

    # Read the array.

    # Initialize prefix = 0, result =0, count_map as a defaultdict(int) or a normal dict.

    # count_map starts with (0,0):1.

    # loop through each element in a:

    #   prefix ^= element

    #   current_parity = (i+1) % 2 → since i is 0-based here.

    #   result += count_map.get( (prefix, current_parity), 0 )

    #   count_map[ (prefix, current_parity) ] +=1

    # So for example, in the first example input:

    # Input is 5 elements: 1 2 3 4 5 → code's a is [1,2,3,4,5].

    # Let's step through:

    # Initialize count_map = { (0,0): 1 }, prefix=0, result=0.

    # i=0 (element 1):

    #   prefix becomes 0 XOR 1 =1.

    #   current_parity = 0+1=1 → 1 mod2=1.

    #   look up (1,1) in count_map → 0.

    #   result remains 0.

    #   add (1,1) to count_map → count_map now has (0,0):1, (1,1):1.

    # i=1 (element 2):

    #   prefix is 1 XOR2=3.

    #   current_parity = 2 → 0.

    #   look up (3,0) → count_map has 0.

    #   result is still 0.

    #   add (3,0) to count_map.

    # i=2 (element3):

    #   prefix is 3 XOR3=0.

    #   current_parity =3 →1.

    #   look up (0,1). count_map has (0,0):1 → no, so 0.

    #   result remains 0.

    #   add (0,1) → now count_map has (0,0):1, (1,1):1, (3,0):1, (0,1):1.

    # i=3 (element4):

    #   prefix is 0 XOR4=4.

    #   current_parity =4 mod2=0.

    #   look up (4,0) → 0.

    #   add to count_map (4,0):1.

    # i=4 (element5):

    #   prefix is4 XOR5=1.

    #   current_parity=5 mod2=1.

    #   look up (1,1) → count_map has (1,1):1. So result +=1.

    #   So result becomes 1.

    #   add (1,1) to count_map → now (1,1) has count 2.

    # So total result is 1, which matches the first example.

    # So the code works for that case.

    # So the approach is correct.

Now, considering the constraints. n can be up to 3e5. The code is O(n), which is acceptable.

In Python, using a defaultdict with tuples as keys should be efficient. But for maximum speed, perhaps using a regular dictionary and tuples as keys.

But in Python, tuples are hashable and can be keys. So, the code can use a dictionary.

So the code would look like:

Read n.

Read the list of a.

Initialize prefix = 0, result =0.

count_map = defaultdict(int) or a normal dict.

But in Python, using a defaultdict is more convenient.

But for speed, perhaps better to use a normal dict and check.

But in code, the initial count_map is {(0,0):1}.

So the code:

Third example:

42 4 2 → code's a is [42,4,2].

i=0:

prefix=42. current_parity=1. key (42,1) → count 0. add (42,1):1.

i=1:

prefix=42^4=46. parity 0. key (46,0) → count 0. add.

i=2:

prefix=46^2=44. parity 3 mod2=1. key (44,1). count 0. add.

Result is 0.

So code works.

So this code should be correct.

Now, in terms of memory and speed:

For n up to 3e5, the code is O(n). Each iteration is O(1) time.

The dictionary can have up to O(n) entries, but in practice, each prefix_xor can be up to 2^20, and with two possible parities. So the maximum possible number of keys is 2^20 *2 = 2^21 = around 2 million. Which is manageable.

In Python, using a normal dict is efficient. Using tuples as keys is fine. The get and set operations are O(1).

Therefore, this code should pass all test cases within the time and memory constraints.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
prefix_xor = 0
count_map = {(0, 0): 1}
result = 0

for i in range(n):
    prefix_xor ^= a[i]
    parity = (i + 1) % 2
    key = (prefix_xor, parity)
    result += count_map.get(key, 0)
    count_map[key] = count_map.get(key, 0) + 1

print(result)
```
