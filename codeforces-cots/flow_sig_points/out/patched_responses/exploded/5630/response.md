Okay, let's see. I need to find the minimum time t when Alexander's c becomes less than or equal to Arthur's a. Both start at the same time and do their operations each second.

Hmm, the problem says that Arthur's operation is a bit complex. Let's break that down. Each second, Arthur does the following: if his current b is >= x, subtract x. Else, decrease a by 1 and set b to w - (x - b). So Arthur's a can decrease over time, but only when his b is less than x. 

Alexander just decreases c by 1 each second. So the initial condition is that c starts higher than a. Because the problem asks when c becomes <= a. So we need to find the earliest time t where c - t <= a - (number of times a has decreased by t seconds) and the rest.

Wait, wait. Wait, Arthur's a is initially a_initial. Each time he has to do the second case (b < x), he subtracts 1 from a. So over t seconds, how many times does Arthur's a decrease?

This is the key part. Let's model how Arthur's a and b change over time.

Let's think about each second. Let's track the current b value for Arthur. Each step, the operation affects a and b based on the current b.

The problem is that simulating each step for t steps up to potentially 1e18 (since c can be up to 2e9, and the time could be similar) is impossible. So we need a mathematical approach to calculate how a and c change over time without iterating each second.

So let's think about how Arthur's a decreases. Each time when Arthur's b is less than x, he loses one a and adjusts b. Let's see how often that happens.

Let's model the process for Arthur. Let's say initial b is b0. Each step, if b >=x, subtract x. Otherwise, a decreases by 1 and b becomes w - (x - b). But how does this affect the next steps?

Alternatively, maybe we can find a cycle in the steps of Arthur's operations. Because the possible values of b are limited (since 0 ≤ b < w), and each operation's outcome depends on the current b. So the sequence of b's must eventually repeat, forming a cycle.

So for example, each time b reaches a certain state, the same sequence of steps would repeat.

Let's take an example. Suppose w=3, x=1, initial b=2.

First step: b >= x (2 >=1), so subtract x. b becomes 1. a remains the same.

Second step: 1 >=1, subtract x: b becomes 0. a remains same.

Third step: 0 <1. So a decreases by 1, and b becomes 3 - (1-0) = 2. So now a is a-1, and b is 2 again. This is the same as the initial state, but a has decreased by 1.

So the cycle here is three steps: the first two steps, a remains same, the third step a decreases by 1 and b returns to 2. So every three steps, a decreases by 1.

So in this case, the number of steps to decrease a by k is 3k.

So the key is to find for each cycle of Arthur's operations, how much a decreases and how much time passes. Then, for each full cycle, we can model the a and time.

So for the general case, perhaps we can find two things:

1. How many steps does it take for Arthur's a to decrease by 1, and how much time that takes.

Wait, but each time a decreases by 1, it's part of a step. Wait, the process is:

Each time when b < x, a is decreased by 1 and b is adjusted. So each time this happens, it's in one step, and that step also causes b to change.

So the steps can be divided into sequences where each sequence ends with a step where a is decreased. The time between these a decreases depends on how many steps are between consecutive a decreases.

So the key is to find, in the sequence of steps, how often a decreases. Each a decrease takes a certain number of steps. For example, in the case where x is 1, and w is 3, each a decrease occurs every 3 steps.

So perhaps we can model this as follows:

For each a decrease, there is a certain number of steps (cycle) needed. Let's find the number of steps per a decrease, and then compute the total steps needed.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can find for each possible initial b, how many steps pass before the next a decrease, and what the new b is after that.

Wait, the initial b is given. Let's consider that when Arthur starts, his b is b0. Then, each step, until he has to decrease a, he will subtract x as possible. Let's see:

Let's model the steps until a is next decreased.

Let's say current b is b_initial. The next steps are:

Each time subtract x from b until it's less than x. Then, in that step, a is decreased by 1, and b is adjusted.

Wait, no. Wait, each step, Arthur checks if his current b >=x. If yes, subtract x. Else, subtract 1 from a, and set b to w - (x - b). So each step is a single operation. So the process for the steps until a is decreased is as follows:

In each step, when b >=x: subtract x. This takes one step. If after subtraction, b is still >=x, repeat.

Wait no. Wait, each step is a single operation. So in each step, regardless of what happens, only one operation is done. So in a single step, he checks b. If it's >=x: subtract x. Else, subtract a and adjust b. So each step is one of these two possibilities.

So the number of steps between a decreases depends on how many steps pass before the step where b is less than x.

So for example, if current b is 5, x is 3. Then step 1: subtract 3 → 2. Now, step 2: check if 2 >=3? No. So subtract a by 1, set b to w - (3-2) = w -1. So after two steps, a has decreased by 1.

Wait, in the first step (5 → 2), no a decrease. Then in the second step (2 <3), a decreases by 1. So two steps for one a decrease.

So the steps between a decreases can vary based on the initial b and x.

Hmm. So perhaps the steps between a decreases can be grouped into cycles where each cycle consists of a certain number of steps, and during that cycle, a decreases by a certain amount.

Alternatively, perhaps each time a decreases, the steps taken and the new b can be determined based on the current b.

Let's model the process for Arthur:

We can model the process as a state machine where the state is (a, b). However, since a can be up to 2e9 and b up to w-1, and w is up to 1e3, tracking the state for all possible a is not feasible. But since w is small, perhaps we can find the cycle in the b's transitions when a is being decreased.

Wait, but each time a is decreased, it's because during that step, b was less than x, leading to a decrease in a and a new b value. So the transitions of b when a decreases can form a cycle.

Let me think: Each time a is decreased, the new b is set to w - (x - b_prev), where b_prev was the current b before the step. So in that case, the new b is w - x + b_prev.

Wait, in the step where b_prev <x:

new_b = w - (x - b_prev) = w -x + b_prev.

So the transition for b when a is decreased is: b → (b + w -x) mod w?

Wait, for example, in the previous example where x=1, w=3, and initial b was 2. When he steps into the b <x case (b=0), new b is 3 - (1-0) = 2. So 0 → 2.

Then in the next steps, subtract x=1. 2 →1, step 1. Then subtract x=1 again, 1→0, step 2. Then step 3, b=0 <x=1. So a decreases by 1, new b becomes 3 - (1-0) =2. So the cycle repeats.

So each time a is decreased, the new b is (b_prev + (w -x)) mod w. Because:

new_b = w - (x - b_prev) = (w -x) + b_prev.

But since w is the modulus, if (w -x) + b_prev >=w, then mod w. But since x <w (given in input constraints), so w -x is positive. But since the original b_prev is <x (since that's the condition for this transition), then:

b_prev <x → (w -x) +b_prev can be up to (w -x) + x-1 = w-1. So new_b is in [w-x ... w-x +x-1] = [w-x ... w-1], but since x <w, w-x is positive. So new_b is in [w-x, w-1]. Which is >=w-x, which is >=1 (since x <w → w-x ≥1).

So after the transition when a is decreased, the new b is (b_prev + (w -x)) mod w. But since b_prev <x, and w -x is positive, then new_b = b_prev + (w -x).

Because b_prev can be up to x-1, and w-x is positive. So the sum is (x-1) + (w -x) = w-1, which is less than w. So mod w is not necessary, the sum is less than w. So new_b is exactly b_prev + (w -x).

So each time a is decreased, the new b is (b_prev + (w -x)).

Wait, but this new b can be equal to or larger than x. For example, in the case where w=5, x=3. If current b_prev is 2 (which is less than x=3), then new_b is 2 + (5-3) =4. Which is >=x=3. So in the next step, Arthur will subtract x=3 again, making b=1. Then next step, subtract again: 1 <3, so a decreases again. So in this case, each a decrease is followed by steps that take varying times.

So the process for a decrease can vary based on the current b.

This suggests that when a decreases, the next steps until another a decrease may vary. But perhaps there's a pattern in the transitions of b when a decreases. Let's see.

Each time a decreases, the new_b is (prev_b + w -x).

But since we have to model this, perhaps we can model the transitions of b when a decreases. Let's track the steps between a decreases and how the b changes each time a is decreased.

For example, after an a decrease, the new_b is set to (prev_b + w -x). Let's call this value new_b.

Then, in the next steps, Arthur will subtract x each step until b becomes less than x again. So the number of steps until the next a decrease is floor(new_b /x) + 1 steps. Wait, let's think:

Suppose new_b is 4, x=3. Then:

Step 1: subtract 3 →1. Now, 1 <3 → next step will trigger an a decrease. So steps between a decreases is 1 (this step) plus the step that triggers the a decrease.

Wait, no. Wait, the steps after the a decrease:

After the a decrease, the new_b is (prev_b + w -x). So in the example, prev_b was 2 (from earlier example), new_b is 4.

Then, in the next step:

Check if new_b >=x (4 >=3 → yes). Subtract x: 4-3=1. That's one step. Then next step:

Check if 1 >=3 → no. So in this step, a is decreased again. So between the two a decreases, there are two steps: subtract x once (step 1), then the next step (step 2) which triggers the a decrease.

So the number of steps between a decreases is 2 steps for this case. So for each a decrease, the next a decrease may take a certain number of steps.

Alternatively, the number of steps between a decreases is (current_b // x) + 1 steps. Let's see:

current_b after a decrease is new_b. Then, in each step, subtract x until current_b <x.

The number of times you can subtract x from new_b is k = new_b // x. Each subtraction takes a step. Then, the (k+1)th step is when current_b <x, leading to another a decrease.

Wait, no. Let's see: new_b is the initial value after the a decrease.

In each step, subtract x if possible.

So the steps are:

count = 0

current = new_b

while current >=x:

   current -=x

   count +=1

then, the next step (count +=1) is when current <x, which triggers a decrease.

So total steps between a decreases is (new_b //x) +1.

Yes, because:

If new_b is 4, x=3. 4//3 =1. So steps is 1 (subtracting x once) +1 (the step where current <x) → 2 steps.

So yes, the steps between a decreases is (new_b //x) +1.

So each time a decreases, the next a decrease will take (new_b //x) +1 steps, where new_b is the value after the previous a decrease.

But new_b after a decrease is (prev_b_before_decrease + w -x). But prev_b_before_decrease was less than x. So:

Let's model the transitions of the b value after each a decrease. Let's denote b_i as the value of b right after the i-th a decrease. So after the i-th a decrease, the new_b is b_i.

Then, the steps between the i-th and (i+1)-th a decrease is (b_i //x) +1 steps. And during those steps, the next a decrease will happen, leading to the next b_{i+1} = (current_b - x *k) where k is the number of times x is subtracted, but since after k steps (each subtracting x), the current_b becomes current_b -k*x. Then, in the next step, since current_b -k*x <x (since k = current_b //x, current_b -k*x is the remainder, which is <x), so after that step, a decreases again and the new_b is ( (current_b -k*x) + (w -x) ) = ( (current_b - (current_b //x)*x ) + w -x ) = (current_b %x) + w -x.

Wait, but current_b after the a decrease is b_i. Then, the steps until next a decrease are (b_i //x) +1 steps. Then, the new_b after the next a decrease is ( (b_i - (b_i //x)*x ) + (w -x) ) = (b_i mod x) + w -x.

But (b_i mod x) is between 0 and x-1. So the new_b is (b_i mod x) + w -x.

But since x <w, w-x is positive. So this new_b is in the range [w -x, w- x + x-1] = [w -x, w-1]. Which is >=w-x and <w. So the new_b is a valid value.

So this gives us a way to model the transitions of b after each a decrease. The key insight here is that after each a decrease, the next a decrease will take a certain number of steps, which depends on the current b_i. The transitions of b_i can form a cycle because the possible values of b_i are limited (since each b_i is in the range [w-x, w-1], which has size x). Wait, w-x to w-1 is a range of (w-1) - (w-x) +1 = x elements. So since x can be up to w-1 (since x <w), the possible b_i values are x possibilities. So after x+1 steps, a cycle must form.

So the sequence of b_i (the b values after each a decrease) must eventually form a cycle. Therefore, the steps between a decreases (call it s_i) and the transitions of b_i can be modeled as a cycle. Once the cycle is found, we can compute how many a decreases occur per cycle and the total steps taken per cycle.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

- Find how the a decreases over time, grouped into cycles once the transitions of b_i start repeating.

- Compute how much a decreases and time (steps) passes per cycle.

Then, for the given initial a, b, c, find the time t when c - t <= a - (number of a decreases up to time t).

But how?

Let's model the problem mathematically.

We need to find the smallest t where:

c - t <= a - k,

where k is the number of a decreases that have occurred up to time t.

Because each a decrease occurs once per a certain number of steps. So the total steps t is the sum of the steps taken for each a decrease, and k is the number of a decreases.

So the inequality can be rearranged as:

t >= c - (a -k)

But since k is the number of a decreases up to t steps, which depends on t. So the problem is to find the minimal t such that c - t <= a_initial - k, where k is the number of a decreases after t steps.

But how do we model k as a function of t?

Alternatively, let's express the required condition as:

c - t <= a_initial - k(t)

=> k(t) >= (c - t) - a_initial (Wait, no. Let's re-arrange:

c - t <= a_initial - k(t)

=> c - t + k(t) <= a_initial

But a_initial is the initial a. Wait, Arthur's a starts at a, and after k decreases, his a is a -k. So the inequality is c - t (Alexander's value) must be <= a -k (Arthur's a after k decreases and t steps).

So to find the minimal t where c - t <= a -k.

But k is the number of a decreases in t steps. So each a decrease takes s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k steps, where s_i is the steps between the (i-1)-th and i-th a decrease (s_1 is the steps before the first a decrease). Wait, no. Wait, the initial steps are the steps before the first a decrease.

Wait, the initial state is a, b. The first a decrease occurs after s steps, where s is the steps until the first a decrease. Then each subsequent a decrease (the second, third, etc.) takes s_i steps.

So the total steps for k a decreases is s_initial + sum_{i=1 to k} s_i, where s_initial is the steps taken before the first a decrease.

Wait, no. Let's see. The first a decrease occurs after s_initial steps. Then, each subsequent a decrease occurs after s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1} steps. So the total steps after k a decreases is s_initial + s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_{k-1}.

Wait, because the first a decrease occurs at s_initial steps. Then, each new a decrease occurs after s_i steps. For example:

- Step 0: initial state.

- After s_initial steps, first a decrease. So steps passed: s_initial.

- Then, after s_1 steps, second a decrease. Total steps: s_initial + s_1.

- Then, after s_2 steps, third a decrease. Total steps: s_initial + s_1 + s_2.

So for k a decreases, the total steps passed is s_initial + sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i, but wait, if there are k a decreases, then sum is s_initial + s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_{k-1}?

No, because the first a decrease takes s_initial steps, then each subsequent a decrease (k-1 more) take s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1} steps.

So for k a decreases, the total steps is s_initial + sum_{i=1 to k-1} s_i}.

But perhaps we can model s_initial as the steps before the first a decrease. Then, each a decrease (including the first) is followed by s_1, s_2, etc. steps. Wait, perhaps the steps to reach the first a decrease is s_initial. Then, the steps between the first and second a decrease is s_1, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps before the first a decrease are computed as follows: how many steps until the first a decrease.

Let's think about the initial b.

Initially, Arthur has a and b. The first a decrease happens when during a step, his b is less than x.

So the initial steps until the first a decrease can be calculated as follows:

current_b = initial_b.

count_steps =0.

We need to find how many steps until current_b becomes less than x.

In each step:

if current_b >=x → subtract x, steps +=1.

else → a decreases, and the steps for this is 1 (the step when current_b <x).

So for the initial steps until the first a decrease, it's:

k_initial = number of times x can be subtracted from initial_b before it becomes less than x.

steps_initial = k_initial +1.

Wait, no. Because in each step, we subtract x once if possible. So steps_initial is the number of steps until the first a decrease.

Let me see:

current_b = initial_b.

steps =0.

while current_b >=x:

   current_b -=x

   steps +=1.

steps +=1 (the step where current_b <x, leading to a decrease).

So steps_initial is steps (k_initial steps where current_b >=x) +1.

So steps_initial = (initial_b //x) +1.

Wait, for example:

initial_b =5, x=3. 5//3=1. So steps_initial is 1 +1=2 steps.

Which is correct: subtract 3 once (step 1), then step 2 (b=2 <3, so a decreases).

So steps_initial is (initial_b //x) +1.

So the first a decrease occurs after steps_initial steps.

Then, after that, the next a decreases take s_1 steps, where s_i is determined by the new_b after each a decrease.

But how to compute the steps_initial, s_1, s_2, etc.?

Well, the first a decrease occurs after steps_initial steps. Then, the new_b after the first a decrease is (initial_b - x*(steps_initial-1) ) + (w -x) - x*0 ?

Wait, no. Let me think:

After steps_initial steps, the first a decrease happens. Let's break down the steps:

The first steps_initial-1 steps are subtracting x from initial_b. Then, in the steps_initial-th step, current_b is initial_b -x*(steps_initial-1) (since each of steps_initial-1 steps subtract x). Then, in that step, since current_b <x, a decreases by 1, and new_b is set to w - (x - current_b).

So new_b after first a decrease is:

new_b = w - (x - current_b) = w -x + current_b.

current_b is initial_b - x*(steps_initial-1).

So current_b after steps_initial-1 subtractions is:

current_b_after_subtractions = initial_b - x*(steps_initial -1).

But steps_initial = (initial_b //x) +1.

Wait, initial_b //x is the number of times x can be subtracted from initial_b before it becomes less than x.

Wait, initial_b //x gives the quotient. For example, initial_b=5, x=3: 5//3=1. steps_initial is 1+1=2. steps_initial-1=1. So current_b_after_subtractions=5-3*1=2.

Which is correct. Then, in the next step, current_b=2 <3, so new_b is w- (3-2) = w-1.

So steps_initial is (initial_b//x)+1.

So the new_b after the first a decrease is:

new_b = w -x + (initial_b - x*(steps_initial-1)).

But steps_initial-1 is (initial_b//x). So:

new_b = w -x + (initial_b - x*(initial_b//x)).

But initial_b - x*(initial_b//x) is initial_b mod x. So:

new_b = (initial_b mod x) + (w -x).

Which is the same as (initial_b mod x) + (w-x).

So this new_b is now the b_i for the next step.

Then, the steps between the first and second a decrease is s_1 = (new_b //x) +1.

So the process for subsequent a decreases is:

Each new_b after an a decrease is (prev_b mod x) + (w -x).

Then, steps between this a decrease and the next is (new_b //x) +1.

So the sequence of steps between a decreases is determined by the new_b after each a decrease, which in turn depends on the previous new_b.

But since new_b is in the range [w-x, w-1], which is a range of size x elements (since w-x to w-1 is x numbers), the transitions of new_b must eventually form a cycle. Because each new_b is determined by the previous new_b. Since there are a finite number of possible new_b values (x possible values), the sequence must repeat after at most x steps.

Thus, the steps between a decreases form a cycle once a new_b is repeated. So the steps between a decreases can be modeled as a cycle of length m steps, where each cycle contributes some a decreases and time steps.

So the approach is:

1. Compute the steps_initial (steps until first a decrease) and the new_b after that decrease.

2. Then, find the cycle in the steps between subsequent a decreases. For each a decrease after the first, track new_b and steps taken. Once a new_b is repeated, we have found the cycle.

3. Once the cycle is found, we can compute how many a decreases occur per cycle, and how many steps are taken per cycle.

4. Using this, model the total steps and a decreases in three phases:

   a. The initial phase before the cycle starts (steps_initial).

   b. The full cycles that can be repeated as much as possible.

   c. The remaining steps after the last full cycle.

Then, for each possible t (time), compute k (number of a decreases) and check if c -t <= a_initial -k.

But how to model this with the cycles to compute the minimal t.

Alternatively, since the problem requires finding the minimal t where c -t <= a_initial -k(t), perhaps we can model this as a mathematical function and find t using binary search.

Wait, binary search over t.

But the problem is that k(t) is the number of a decreases up to time t. So for each possible t, can we compute k(t) quickly?

If we can compute k(t) efficiently, then we can binary search on t to find the minimal t where the condition holds.

But how to compute k(t) efficiently.

The steps are as follows:

For a given t, we need to compute how many a decreases have occurred by time t. Each a decrease takes some steps. So the sum of steps taken for the a decreases up to k(t) is <= t.

But this seems challenging. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of k (number of a decreases), and find the minimal t such that:

c - (t) <= a -k → t >= c - (a -k) → t >= (c - a +k).

But also, the steps taken for k a decreases is s_initial + s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_{k-1} <= t.

So the total steps needed to have k a decreases is s(k) = s_initial + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} s_i, where s_i is the steps between a decrease i and i+1.

But since s_i may form a cycle, the sum can be split into initial steps, full cycles, and remaining steps.

So the plan is:

1. Compute s_initial (steps before first a decrease) and new_b after first a decrease.

2. For the subsequent steps, track the transitions of new_b and steps between a decreases, until a cycle is detected.

3. Once the cycle is found, compute how many steps and a decreases are in each cycle.

4. For a given k, compute the total steps s(k) as s_initial + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} s_i.

But this is challenging. However, using the cycle information, we can split the sum into:

- pre-cycle steps (if any),

- full cycles,

- post-cycle steps.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process after the first a decrease forms a cycle. Let's assume that after the first a decrease, the steps between a decreases form a cycle of length m steps, and each cycle contributes l a decreases and takes c_steps steps.

Wait, no. Each cycle is in the steps between a decreases. For example, after the first a decrease, the steps between a decreases form a cycle of period m. Each cycle could consist of m steps, each contributing some a decreases and steps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first a decrease, the steps between a decreases form a cycle where each cycle is composed of some steps and a certain number of a decreases.

But to proceed, let's suppose that after the first a decrease, the sequence of steps between a decreases forms a cycle of length m. Each cycle has p a decreases and takes q steps.

But how to find p and q?

Alternatively, perhaps each cycle consists of a fixed number of a decreases and steps. For example, if after some steps, the new_b values start repeating, then the steps between a decreases will repeat as well.

Let me take an example. Suppose w=5, x=2.

Initial b after first a decrease is (initial_b mod x) + (w-x) → depends on initial_b. But after the first a decrease, new_b is in the range [w-x, w-1], which for w=5, x=2 is [3,4].

So new_b can be 3 or 4.

For example, if new_b is 3:

steps between a decreases is (3//2) +1 =1 +1=2 steps.

Then, the next new_b is (3 mod 2) + (5-2) =1 +3=4.

steps between a decreases for new_b=4 is (4//2)+1=2+1=3 steps.

Then, new_b is (4 mod 2) +3=0 +3=3. So the sequence cycles between 3 and4.

So the steps between a decreases cycle between 2 steps and 3 steps. So each two a decreases take 2+3=5 steps. So the cycle is of length 2 a decreases and 5 steps.

So for each cycle of two a decreases, 5 steps are taken.

So in this case, the cycle is (3 →4 →3) steps.

So once the cycle is detected, each cycle contributes 2 a decreases and 5 steps.

So the key is to find:

- initial steps (s_initial) and a decrease (k_initial =1).

- Then, the steps and a decreases for each cycle.

Thus, the steps can be split into:

s_initial (steps for first a decrease) → k=1.

Then, for the remaining a decreases, they are grouped into cycles.

So for the problem, the algorithm would be:

Compute the initial steps s_initial and new_b after first a decrease.

Then, track subsequent steps between a decreases until a new_b repeats. This will form a cycle.

Once the cycle is found, compute for each cycle:

- how many a decreases are there per cycle (cycle_decreases).

- how many steps are taken per cycle (cycle_steps).

Once the cycle is found, we can model the problem as:

The first a decrease takes s_initial steps.

Then, for the remaining a decreases (k-1), they can be divided into full cycles and partial cycles.

So the total steps for k a decreases is:

s_initial + (full_cycles * cycle_steps) + remaining_steps.

But this depends on how the cycles are structured.

This is getting complex. Let's think of a way to model this.

Once the cycle is found (say, after the first a decrease), the steps between a decreases form a cycle of m steps, which contributes p a decreases and q steps per cycle.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute all possible a decreases and their steps until a cycle is formed, and then use that information to compute k and steps.

But for large k, this would be time-consuming unless we can find a mathematical way to compute this.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute the initial steps and steps between a decreases until a cycle is found.

2. Once the cycle is found, for the remaining a decreases, compute how many full cycles and how many steps are needed.

But how?

Alternatively, since the problem requires finding the minimal t where c -t <= a -k, and t is the total steps taken for k a decreases plus any possible additional steps (after the last a decrease but before the next).

Wait, no. Because the steps for k a decreases is s_initial + sum of s_i for the first k-1 steps. Then, after those steps, we have t = s_initial + sum(s_i for i=0 to k-1). But during those steps, there are exactly k a decreases. So after those steps, the a has decreased by k.

But then, the condition is c - t <= a_initial -k.

So for each possible k, we can compute the minimal t required for k a decreases. Then find the smallest t where t >= (c - (a_initial -k)) and t is the steps needed for k a decreases.

Wait, no. Because the steps needed for k a decreases is s(k), which is the steps_initial plus sum of steps between each a decrease. For example, k=1: steps_initial. k=2: steps_initial + steps_1. Etc.

But the condition is c - s(k) <= a_initial -k.

So we can model this as for each k, compute s(k) and check if s(k) >= (c - (a_initial -k)).

But solving this for k directly is challenging. However, perhaps we can binary search over k, the number of a decreases. For each k, compute the minimal t that allows k a decreases and satisfies t >= (c - a_initial +k). Also, compute the minimal steps required for k a decreases. Then, the maximum between these two values is the required t for this k. The minimal such t across all possible k is the answer.

But how to find the minimal k for which this is possible.

Alternatively, the required condition is:

s(k) >= (c - a_initial +k).

But s(k) is the steps needed for k a decreases. We need to find the minimal t where t is the maximum between s(k) and (c -a_initial +k), for some k.

The minimal t will be the maximum of these two values for the minimal possible k.

But this may not hold, as larger k may lead to smaller s(k) and larger (c -a_initial +k), but perhaps this is a way to model it.

Alternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal t where:

t >= s(k)

t >= (c -a_initial +k)

for some k >=0.

And the minimal such t.

So the minimal t is the maximum of these two values for some k, and we need to find the k that minimizes this maximum.

But how to find the optimal k.

This seems like a convex optimization problem. The function t(k) = max(s(k), (c -a_initial +k)) would first decrease and then increase, or vice versa. So we can binary search for the optimal k.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the k where (c -a_initial +k) <= s(k), and the next k+1 would require s(k+1) which is larger than (c -a_initial +k+1). Or something like that.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think of another approach.

Assume that after the initial steps and cycles, we can model the steps for k a decreases as:

steps = initial_steps + cycles * cycle_steps + remaining_steps.

Similarly, the a decreases are 1 + cycles * cycle_decreases + remaining_decreases.

We need to find the minimal t where c -t <= a_initial -k.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the time when Alexander overtakes Arthur by considering the difference between c and a.

Initially, Alexander's c is higher than a. But each second, Alexander's c decreases by 1, while Arthur's a decreases by k per t seconds (where t is the steps taken for k decreases).

So the difference between c and a is (c -t) - (a -k) = (c -a) - (t -k). We need this to be <=0.

So (c -a) <= t -k.

But t is the total steps for k a decreases, which is s(k). So:

(c -a) <= s(k) -k → s(k) -k >= (c -a).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the problem is to find the minimal t where t >= (c -a_initial +k) and t >= s(k), for some k >=0.

The minimal t is the minimal maximum of these two.

But how to find k that minimizes max( s(k), c -a_initial +k ).

But how to compute s(k) efficiently for large k.

This is where the cycle comes into play.

Once the cycle is detected, the steps per cycle (cycle_steps) and the a decreases per cycle (cycle_decreases) can be used to compute the steps for large k.

For example:

After the initial steps and possibly some a decreases before the cycle starts, the remaining a decreases can be divided into full cycles and a remainder.

So the steps would be:

s(k) = initial_steps + pre_cycle_steps + (full_cycles * cycle_steps) + rem_steps.

The a decreases would be:

k = 1 + pre_cycle_decreases + (full_cycles * cycle_decreases) + rem_decreases.

But this requires tracking the pre-cycle steps and decreases, which adds complexity.

Perhaps it's better to precompute all possible steps and a decreases until a cycle is found, then model the rest using the cycle.

So the plan is:

1. Compute the initial steps_initial (steps before first a decrease) and new_b after first a decrease.

2. Then, compute the steps and a decreases for each subsequent a decrease until a cycle is found. For example, track the new_b after each a decrease and the steps between a decreases. If a new_b repeats, we have found a cycle.

3. Once the cycle is found, split the process into:

   a. Initial phase: steps_initial and first a decrease.

   b. Pre-cycle phase: steps and a decreases before the cycle starts.

   c. Cycle phase: each cycle contributes a certain number of steps and a decreases.

4. With this information, for any k, compute s(k) as:

   s(k) = steps_initial + pre_steps + (full_cycles * cycle_steps) + rem_steps.

   where k =1 + pre_decreases + (full_cycles * cycle_decreases) + rem_decreases.

But this is getting complicated.

An alternative approach is to model the steps and a decreases using the cycle information and compute the minimal t using mathematical formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use binary search on t. For each t, compute the number of a decreases up to t steps and check if c -t <= a_initial -k.

But how to compute k for a given t.

This requires knowing how many a decreases have happened in t steps.

To compute k for a given t:

- Compute how many steps are taken in the initial phase (steps_initial). If t < steps_initial: k=0.

- Else, k=1, and remaining_steps = t - steps_initial.

- Then, for the remaining steps, we need to compute how many a decreases can be made with the remaining_steps, considering the cycle.

So for example, once the initial steps are done, each a decrease after that takes s_1, s_2, etc. steps. Once a cycle is detected, the remaining steps can be divided into full cycles and remainder.

But how to compute this for a given remaining_steps.

This requires precomputing the steps between a decreases and the cycle information.

But this seems manageable.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Precompute steps_initial and new_b_after_initial.

   steps_initial = (b_initial //x) +1.

   new_b_after_initial = (b_initial %x) + (w -x).

2. Then, track subsequent steps between a decreases and new_b values until a cycle is detected.

   For this, we can use a dictionary to map new_b values to the step index and steps taken.

3. Once a new_b is repeated, we can find the cycle.

   The cycle starts at the first occurrence of new_b and ends at the second occurrence.

   For example:

   new_b sequence: [b0, b1, b2, b0, b1, b2, ...] → cycle is [b0, b1, b2].

   So the steps between a decreases in the cycle are s0, s1, s2, s0, s1, s2, etc.

4. With the cycle information, compute:

   cycle_steps: sum of steps in one cycle.

   cycle_decreases: number of a decreases in one cycle (equal to the number of steps in the cycle).

   So for example, if the cycle has 3 steps between a decreases, then cycle_decreases is 3 (each step between a decrease is one a decrease per step? No, each step between a decrease corresponds to one a decrease. So if the cycle has s0, s1, s2 steps between a decreases, then the cycle contributes 3 a decreases and the sum of s0+s1+s2 steps.

So the cycle_decreases is the number of steps between a decreases in the cycle (since each step between a decrease corresponds to one a decrease).

So for a cycle of steps between a decreases [s0, s1, ..., sm-1], the cycle_steps is sum(s_i) for i=0 to m-1, and the cycle_decreases is m.

So once the cycle is detected, we can model the steps and decreases after the initial phase.

So for a given remaining_steps (after steps_initial), the number of a decreases is:

k_initial =1 (from initial steps).

Then, in the remaining_steps:

   steps_consumed =0.

   a_decreases =0.

   pre_cycle: steps between a decreases until the cycle starts.

   during_cycle: full cycles and remaining steps.

But this requires splitting the remaining_steps into pre-cycle steps, full cycles, and post-cycle steps.

Alternatively, once the cycle is detected, we can compute how many steps are in the pre-cycle phase, how many steps and a decreases in each cycle, and then model the remaining steps.

But this is quite complex.

Another approach: Once the cycle is found, the steps between a decreases after the initial phase can be split into:

pre-cycle steps: steps between a decreases before the cycle starts.

cycle steps: the steps in each full cycle.

post-cycle steps: steps in the current cycle.

But perhaps this is manageable.

For example:

Assume after the initial phase, we have a list of steps between a decreases: s_list = [s0, s1, s2, s0, s1, s2, ...]. The cycle starts at index 0 (s0 is the start of the cycle).

But perhaps the cycle starts after some steps.

Alternatively, the cycle could start at the first occurrence of a new_b value.

So the steps between a decreases after the initial phase can be divided into two parts: the steps before the cycle starts (pre_cycle_steps and pre_cycle_decreases), and the steps within the cycle (cycle_steps and cycle_decreases).

Once we have this, for a given remaining_steps, we can compute how many a decreases are possible by:

1. Subtract pre_cycle_steps from remaining_steps. If after this, there are steps left, then each cycle contributes cycle_decreases a decreases and cycle_steps steps.

2. Compute how many full cycles fit into the remaining steps, and then compute the remaining steps after that.

3. For the remaining steps after full cycles, compute how many a decreases are possible in the partial cycle.

But how to implement this.

This requires a detailed implementation.

But given the time constraints, perhaps a better way is to precompute all possible steps between a decreases until a cycle is found, and then model the process.

But for the purposes of solving this problem, perhaps a binary search approach can be used.

Let's consider binary searching on the possible t. For each t, compute how many a decreases have been made (k), and check if c - t <= a_initial -k.

If we can compute k efficiently for any t, then binary search is feasible.

So how to compute k for a given t:

k is the number of a decreases in t steps.

The steps to compute k:

1. Compute the steps_initial. If t < steps_initial → k=0.

Else, k starts at 1. remaining_steps = t - steps_initial.

2. Then, track the steps between each a decrease and new_b until a cycle is found.

3. For the remaining_steps, compute how many a decreases can be made in this time.

This requires knowing the steps between each a decrease after the initial phase.

But for large t, this is not feasible to compute step by step.

Thus, we need to model the cycle and compute k as follows:

Once the cycle is found, the steps between a decreases after the initial phase can be split into:

pre_cycle_steps: steps before the cycle starts.

pre_cycle_decreases: a decreases before the cycle starts.

cycle_steps: steps per cycle.

cycle_decreases: a decreases per cycle.

Then, the remaining_steps after steps_initial can be split into:

pre_cycle_steps_part: steps used in the pre-cycle phase.

full_cycles: number of full cycles that fit into the remaining steps after pre_cycle_steps_part.

rem_steps: remaining steps after full cycles.

Then, the total a decreases would be:

k = 1 (from initial steps) + pre_cycle_decreases + full_cycles * cycle_decreases + rem_decreases.

Where rem_decreases is the number of a decreases possible in the rem_steps by stepping through the cycle steps.

So the steps to compute this are:

Compute steps_initial and new_b_initial.

If t < steps_initial → k=0.

Else:

   k=1.

   remaining_steps = t - steps_initial.

   Then, track the steps between each a decrease after the initial, until a cycle is found.

   Once the cycle is found, split the steps into pre-cycle and cycle.

   Then, compute how many steps are used in pre-cycle steps.

   For example, if after the initial a decrease, there are s1, s2 steps between a decreases before the cycle starts, then pre_cycle_steps = s1 + s2.

   pre_cycle_decreases = 2.

   Then, cycle_steps is the sum of steps in the cycle, and cycle_decreases is the number of a decreases per cycle.

   The remaining_steps after pre_cycle_steps_part is:

   remaining_steps -= pre_cycle_steps.

   If remaining_steps >=0:

      full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_steps.

      remaining_steps -= full_cycles * cycle_steps.

      k += pre_cycle_decreases + full_cycles * cycle_decreases.

      Then, iterate through the cycle steps to see how many a decreases can be made with the remaining_steps.

      For each step in the cycle:

         if remaining_steps >= step:

             remaining_steps -= step

             k +=1

         else:

             break.

   So after this, k is the total a decreases.

But how to implement this.

But given the time constraints for this problem (1 second), and the maximum possible steps up to 2e9, the code must be efficient.

Thus, the plan is:

1. Precompute steps_initial and new_b_initial.

2. Precompute the steps between a decreases after the initial phase until a cycle is detected.

3. Once a cycle is found, precompute the pre_cycle steps, pre_cycle_decreases, cycle_steps, cycle_decreases.

4. For a given t, compute k by:

   a. Check if t < steps_initial → k=0.

   b. Else, remaining_steps = t - steps_initial.

      k=1.

      Then, process the pre-cycle steps.

      For each step in the pre-cycle steps:

         if remaining_steps >= step:

             remaining_steps -= step

             k +=1.

         else:

             break.

      If remaining_steps ==0 → done.

      Else:

          compute full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_steps.

          k += full_cycles * cycle_decreases.

          remaining_steps -= full_cycles * cycle_steps.

          Then, process each step in the cycle steps until remaining_steps is exhausted.

          For each step in the cycle:

              if remaining_steps >= step:

                  remaining_steps -= step

                  k +=1.

              else:

                  break.

      Thus, the total k is computed.

5. Then, check if c -t <= a_initial -k.

   If yes, then t is a candidate.

Using this, we can perform a binary search on t to find the minimal t where this condition holds.

The binary search would have a lower bound of 0 and upper bound of max possible t. The maximum possible t is when c is initially 2e9 and a is 0. So t would be up to 2e9.

But binary search would take log2(2e9) ≈30 steps, which is manageable.

But how to compute the upper bound for binary search.

Alternatively, the minimal t can't be more than (c - a_initial) + k, where k is the maximum possible steps. But this is not clear.

Alternatively, since the maximum c and a_initial are 2e9, the upper bound can be set to 2e14 or similar, but this could be excessive.

But since each step of the binary search requires O(1) time (with precomputed cycles), it's manageable.

So the code plan is:

- Read a, b, w, x, c.

- Compute steps_initial = (b //x) +1.

- new_b_initial = (b %x) + (w -x).

- Compute the steps between subsequent a decreases until a cycle is detected.

   For this, we'll use a dictionary to track new_b values and their positions.

   Initialize a list 'steps_list' to store the steps between a decreases after the initial phase.

   Also, a dictionary 'seen' to track new_b values and their indices.

   current_b = new_b_initial.

   seen[current_b] = 0.

   steps_list = []

   while True:

       s = (current_b //x) +1.

       steps_list.append(s)

       current_b = (current_b %x) + (w -x)

       if current_b in seen:

           // cycle detected.

           cycle_start_index = seen[current_b]

           pre_cycle_steps = sum(steps_list[:cycle_start_index])

           pre_cycle_decreases = cycle_start_index.

           cycle_steps = sum(steps_list[cycle_start_index:])

           cycle_decreases = len(steps_list) - cycle_start_index.

           break.

       else:

           seen[current_b] = len(steps_list)

   // Now, steps_list contains all steps between a decreases after initial phase.

   // pre_cycle_steps is sum of steps before cycle starts.

   // pre_cycle_decreases is the number of a decreases in pre-cycle.

   // cycle_steps is steps per cycle.

   // cycle_decreases is a decreases per cycle.

   // Also, the steps in the cycle are steps_list[cycle_start_index:].

   So steps_after_initial = steps_list.

- Once the cycle is found, the code can proceed.

Now, for a given t, compute k as follows:

def compute_k(t):

    if t < steps_initial:

        return 0

    k =1

    remaining = t - steps_initial

    // Process pre-cycle steps.

    // Pre-cycle steps are steps_list[0...cycle_start_index-1]

    pre_cycle_steps = sum(steps_list[:cycle_start_index])

    pre_cycle_decreases = cycle_start_index

    if remaining >= pre_cycle_steps:

        k += pre_cycle_decreases

        remaining -= pre_cycle_steps

    else:

        // sum steps until remaining is exhausted.

        sum_steps =0

        for s in steps_list[:cycle_start_index]:

            sum_steps += s

            if sum_steps <= remaining:

                k +=1

            else:

                break

        remaining -= sum_steps

        return k

    // Now process full cycles.

    full_cycles = remaining // cycle_steps

    k += full_cycles * cycle_decreases

    remaining -= full_cycles * cycle_steps

    // Process remaining steps in the cycle.

    sum_steps =0

    for s in steps_list[cycle_start_index:]:

        if sum_steps + s <= remaining:

            sum_steps += s

            k +=1

        else:

            break

    return k

But this is a simplified version. However, in practice, it's better to precompute the pre_cycle steps and cycle steps as lists to avoid recomputing them each time.

But given that the steps_list can be up to w elements (since w is up to 1e3), this is manageable.

So, in the code:

- pre_cycle_steps_list = steps_list[:cycle_start_index]

- cycle_steps_list = steps_list[cycle_start_index:]

- pre_cycle_total_steps = sum(pre_cycle_steps_list)

- pre_cycle_total_decreases = len(pre_cycle_steps_list)

- cycle_total_steps = sum(cycle_steps_list)

- cycle_total_decreases = len(cycle_steps_list)

Then, in the compute_k function:

def compute_k(t):

    if t < steps_initial:

        return 0

    k =1

    remaining = t - steps_initial

    # Process pre-cycle steps.

    if remaining <=0:

        return k

    # Check how much of pre_cycle_steps can be used.

    sum_steps_pre =0

    cnt =0

    for s in pre_cycle_steps_list:

        if sum_steps_pre + s <= remaining:

            sum_steps_pre +=s

            cnt +=1

        else:

            break

    k += cnt

    remaining -= sum_steps_pre

    if remaining <=0:

        return k

    # Process full cycles.

    full_cycles = remaining // cycle_total_steps

    k += full_cycles * cycle_total_decreases

    remaining -= full_cycles * cycle_total_steps

    if remaining <=0:

        return k

    # Process remaining steps in the cycle.

    sum_steps_cycle =0

    cnt_cycle =0

    for s in cycle_steps_list:

        if sum_steps_cycle + s <= remaining:

            sum_steps_cycle += s

            cnt_cycle +=1

        else:

            break

    k += cnt_cycle

    return k

Once this compute_k function is available, the binary search can proceed.

The binary search will find the minimal t where c - t <= a - compute_k(t).

But the binary search needs to find the smallest t such that this condition holds.

But since the condition may not be monotonic, we need to ensure that once the condition is true for t, all larger t will also satisfy it.

Wait, but as t increases, compute_k(t) increases (since more steps allow more a decreases). So c -t decreases, a - compute_k(t) decreases (since a is initial a minus compute_k(t)).

But the condition is c -t <= a - compute_k(t).

So for t1 < t2:

If t1 satisfies the condition, then t2 may or may not. But we need the minimal t where the condition is first met.

But I think the condition is monotonic. Because for larger t, c -t decreases and a - compute_k(t) also decreases. But compute_k(t) increases with t, so a - compute_k(t) decreases.

But how to see if the condition is monotonic.

Suppose at t, the condition is true.

For t+1:

c - (t+1) = (c -t) -1.

a - compute_k(t+1) = a - (compute_k(t) + delta), where delta is 0 or 1, depending on whether the (t+1) step caused an a decrease.

So the left side decreases by 1, the right side decreases by delta.

So the new condition is (c -t -1) <= (a -k(t) - delta).

Which may not be true even if the previous condition was true.

Thus, the condition is not necessarily monotonic.

Thus, binary search may not work directly. But perhaps there's a way to model the minimal t.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the minimal t by finding the smallest t where t >= (c - a +k) and compute_k(t) >= (c -t) -a.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal t is the maximum of (c -a +k) and s(k), where s(k) is the steps required for k a decreases.

Thus, for each k, the minimal t is max(c -a +k, s(k)).

The minimal such t over all k >=0 is the answer.

But how to find the optimal k.

But k can be up to (c - a_initial), since if k >= (c - a_initial), then a_initial -k can be <= c -t.

But this is not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal k is around (c - a_initial) + t, but this is not helpful.

But given that the code for compute_k and compute s(k) is manageable, perhaps we can compute the minimal t by iterating k from 0 up to (c - a_initial) + some buffer.

But this is not feasible for large values.

But given that the cycle can be processed efficiently, perhaps we can compute the minimal t by considering the following:

The required condition is:

c - t <= a_initial -k.

=> k >= (c - t) - a_initial.

But t is the steps for k a decreases.

But this seems tricky.

Alternatively, the required condition can be rewritten as:

k >= (c - a_initial) - t.

But since k is the number of a decreases after t steps, it's not clear.

An alternative approach is to note that when Alexander overtakes Arthur, the inequality c -t <= a_initial -k must hold. So the minimal t is when this inequality is first satisfied.

But to compute t for this, we can model t as the steps taken for k a decreases, and the required t must be >= (c - a_initial) +k.

So for each k, the minimal t is max(s(k), (c -a_initial) +k).

The minimal such t over all k is the answer.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal max(s(k), (c -a_initial) +k) for k >=0.

To find this, we can binary search on k, but the function may not be convex.

Alternatively, since s(k) is non-decreasing in k, and (c -a_initial) +k is increasing in k, the function max(s(k), (c -a_initial) +k) is minimized when s(k) and (c -a_initial)+k are as close as possible.

Thus, the optimal k is where s(k) is approximately equal to (c -a_initial) +k.

So we can search for the k where s(k) is as close as possible to (c -a_initial) +k.

But how to find such k.

Alternatively, since s(k) increases with k and (c -a_initial) +k also increases with k, the minimal max is achieved when s(k) >= (c -a_initial) +k and s(k) is minimal.

Or when (c -a_initial) +k >= s(k) and (c -a_initial) +k is minimal.

Thus, the minimal t is the maximum of s(k) and (c -a_initial)+k.

So to find the minimal t, we need to find the k where the two values cross.

But how.

Another approach is to find the k where s(k) = (c -a_initial) +k.

But this may not be possible, so find the k where s(k) is just >= (c -a_initial) +k.

But how to compute this.

But given that s(k) can be computed efficiently for any k using the precomputed cycle information, perhaps we can compute this k by binary search.

But the k can be up to (c -a_initial) + s(k), which for large values may be up to 2e9 + 2e9 =4e9. Binary search over this range would take 32 steps.

Each step requires computing s(k) for a given k, which can be done by compute_k_steps(k).

But compute_k_steps(k) is the steps needed for k a decreases.

But how to compute s(k) given k.

But s(k) is the steps needed for k a decreases.

Which can be computed as:

if k ==0:

   s(k) =0.

else:

   steps_initial + sum of steps for the first (k-1) a decreases after the initial.

But this is difficult to compute for large k, but using the cycle information, we can compute it.

So for k=0: s=0.

For k=1: s= steps_initial.

For k>1:

   after the initial a decrease, there are (k-1) a decreases.

   The steps for these (k-1) a decreases can be computed using the pre-cycle and cycle steps.

Thus, to compute s(k):

def compute_s(k):

    if k ==0:

        return 0

    if k ==1:

        return steps_initial

    total_steps = steps_initial

    remaining_decreases =k-1

    # process pre-cycle steps.

    if remaining_decreases > pre_cycle_decreases:

        total_steps += pre_cycle_steps

        remaining_decreases -= pre_cycle_decreases

    else:

        sum_steps = sum(pre_cycle_steps_list[:remaining_decreases])

        total_steps += sum_steps

        return total_steps

    # process cycles.

    full_cycles = remaining_decreases // cycle_total_decreases

    total_steps += full_cycles * cycle_total_steps

    remaining_decreases -= full_cycles * cycle_total_decreases

    # process remaining steps.

    sum_steps = sum(cycle_steps_list[:remaining_decreases])

    total_steps += sum_steps

    return total_steps

Thus, given this function, we can compute s(k) for any k.

Now, the problem becomes finding the minimal max(s(k), (c -a_initial) +k) over k >=0.

The optimal k is where s(k) and (c -a_initial) +k are as close as possible.

But how to find this.

The optimal k can be found by checking the k where (c -a_initial) +k is as large as possible but not exceeding s(k), or the other way around.

But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, we can binary search for k where s(k) >= (c -a_initial) +k.

The minimal t would then be s(k).

But perhaps there exists a k where s(k) is just >= (c -a_initial) +k.

Once found, the minimal t is s(k).

Alternatively, we can iterate k from 0 upwards, but this is not feasible for large k.

But given that the code for compute_s(k) is efficient, perhaps we can find the minimal k where s(k) >= (c -a_initial) +k.

This can be done via binary search.

The steps for this approach:

1. Compute the minimal k where s(k) >= (c -a_initial) +k.

   The minimal t is s(k).

2. Also, check for k where (c -a_initial) +k >=s(k). The minimal t is (c -a_initial) +k.

But how to find the minimal max.

Alternatively, the minimal t is the minimal possible maximum of s(k) and (c -a_initial) +k.

But how to find this.

The minimal t is achieved either when s(k) = (c -a_initial) +k, or when k is such that s(k) is just over or under.

But this is a bit vague.

Alternatively, the minimal t is the minimal value of max(s(k), (c -a_initial)+k) for all k >=0.

To find this, we can iterate k in a range where s(k) and (c -a_initial)+k are close.

But for large values of k, this is not feasible.

Thus, perhaps the best approach is to use binary search on k, and for each k compute max(s(k), (c -a_initial)+k), then find the minimal such max.

But this requires iterating over a range of k.

But considering that the minimal t must be such that either s(k) >= (c -a_initial)+k or (c -a_initial)+k >=s(k), the minimal t will be the maximum of these two for some k.

But how to find the optimal k.

Alternatively, note that when (c -a_initial) +k <= s(k), then t = s(k). But this requires finding the smallest k where (c -a_initial) +k <= s(k), but this is not possible for large k.

Alternatively, the minimal t is when the two terms are equal or as close as possible.

But this is not easy.

Given time constraints, perhaps the best way to proceed is to implement the binary search on t.

But how.

The binary search for t will have low=0 and high= max possible t, such as max(c, steps_initial + pre_cycle_steps + ...).

But it's better to compute the upper bound for t.

The worst-case scenario is when a is 1 and c is 2e9, and Arthur's a doesn't decrease. Then, the required t is 2e9 -1.

But given that Arthur's a will eventually decrease, the worst case is when a decreases once every step. So t is up to c - a_initial.

But not sure.

Alternatively, the upper bound can be set to max(c, steps_initial + pre_cycle_steps + cycle_steps * 1e9).

But this is not feasible.

But given that the binary search runs in log2(upper_bound) steps, and each step is O(1), perhaps setting upper_bound to 1e18 is acceptable.

Thus, the code would:

- Binary search t between 0 and 1e18.

- For each t, compute k = compute_k(t).

- Check if c -t <= a_initial -k.

- The minimal t where this is true is the answer.

But the problem is that compute_k(t) can be O(w) per call, which is acceptable since w is up to 1e3 and binary search is 30 steps → 3e4 operations.

Which is manageable.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

Now, let's proceed to code this.

First, we need to compute the steps_initial, steps_list, and cycle information.

Then, the compute_k function.

Then, perform binary search.

But the code is quite involved.

Let's outline the code step by step.

First, read the inputs:

a, b, w, x, c = map(int, input().split())

Then, compute steps_initial and new_b_initial.

steps_initial = (b // x) + 1

new_b_initial = (b % x) + (w - x)

Then, track the steps between a decreases after the initial phase.

We need to track the steps between a decreases and detect cycles.

We can use a dictionary to track the new_b values and their indices.

seen = dict()

steps_list = []

current_b = new_b_initial

seen[current_b] = 0

cycle_found = False

pre_cycle_steps_list = []

cycle_steps_list = []

cycle_start_idx = 0

pre_cycle_steps = 0

pre_cycle_decreases = 0

cycle_steps = 0

cycle_decreases = 0

while True:

    s = (current_b // x) + 1

    steps_list.append(s)

    current_b = (current_b % x) + (w - x)

    if current_b in seen:

        # Cycle detected

        cycle_start_idx = seen[current_b]

        # Split steps_list into pre-cycle and cycle steps

        pre_cycle_steps_list = steps_list[:cycle_start_idx]

        cycle_steps_list = steps_list[cycle_start_idx:]

        pre_cycle_decreases = len(pre_cycle_steps_list)

        pre_cycle_steps = sum(pre_cycle_steps_list)

        cycle_decreases = len(cycle_steps_list)

        cycle_steps = sum(cycle_steps_list)

        break

    else:

        seen[current_b] = len(steps_list)

This code will generate the steps_list and split into pre_cycle and cycle steps.

Then, the compute_k function is:

def compute_k(t):

    if t < steps_initial:

        return 0

    k = 1

    remaining = t - steps_initial

    # Process pre_cycle steps

    sum_pre_steps = 0

    pre_count = 0

    for s in pre_cycle_steps_list:

        if sum_pre_steps + s <= remaining:

            sum_pre_steps += s

            pre_count +=1

        else:

            break

    k += pre_count

    remaining -= sum_pre_steps

    if remaining <= 0:

        return k

    # Process full cycles

    full_cycles = remaining // cycle_steps

    k += full_cycles * cycle_decreases

    remaining -= full_cycles * cycle_steps

    if remaining <= 0:

        return k

    # Process remaining steps in cycle

    sum_cycle_steps =0

    cycle_count =0

    for s in cycle_steps_list:

        if sum_cycle_steps + s <= remaining:

            sum_cycle_steps +=s

            cycle_count +=1

        else:

            break

    k += cycle_count

    return k

Now, perform binary search on t.

low = 0

high = 10**18

answer = high

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) //2

    k = compute_k(mid)

    if c - mid <= a - k:

        answer = mid

        high = mid -1

    else:

        low = mid +1

print(answer)

But this may not work because the binary search may not find the correct t.

But let's test this with the first sample input.

Sample input 1:

4 2 3 1 6

a=4, b=2, w=3, x=1, c=6.

Initial steps_initial = (2//1) +1 =2+1=3 steps? Wait, no.

Wait, initial steps_initial is the steps until the first a decrease.

initial_b = 2.

In each step:

Step 1: subtract x=1 → b=1. Steps_initial is (2//1)+1=2+1=3 steps? Wait, no.

Wait, steps_initial is (b //x) +1 → 2//1 =2 → steps_initial=3.

But in 3 steps:

Step 1: b=2-1=1.

Step 2: b=1-1=0.

Step 3: b=0 <x=1 → a decreases by 1.

Yes, steps_initial is 3 steps.

But in the first sample input, the output is 2. This suggests that after 2 steps, Alexander's c is 6-2=4, and Arthur's a is 4-0=4. So 4 <=4, hence the answer is 2.

But according to the code, when t=2, compute_k(2):

t=2 < steps_initial=3 → k=0.

So condition is 6-2=4 <=4-0=4 → yes.

Thus, the answer is 2.

But the code's binary search will find this.

The code's binary search will check mid=0, then mid=5e17, etc., but eventually, when mid=2, compute_k(2) returns 0, and the condition is true.

Thus, the code would correctly return 2.

Another sample input is the fourth example:

Input:

1 1 2 1 1

Output:0.

At t=0, c-0=1-0=1. a -k=1-0=1. 1 <=1 → condition is true. So answer is 0.

Thus, the code would output 0.

Thus, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.

Thus, the code is correct.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time in seconds when Alexander's number (c) becomes less than or equal to Arthur's number (a) if both start performing their operations simultaneously. Arthur's operations are more complex and involve decrementing either his value `b` by `x` or adjusting `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. Alexander simply decrements his value `c` by 1 each second.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The key challenge is to efficiently determine the number of operations Arthur performs that result in decrementing `a` and the time taken for those operations. Direct simulation is infeasible due to large input constraints, so we need an optimized approach.
2. **Cycle Detection**: Arthur's operations on `b` can form a cycle due to the constraints on `b` (0 ≤ b < w). By detecting this cycle, we can avoid redundant calculations and efficiently compute the number of operations.
3. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to determine the minimum time `t` where Alexander's number (c - t) is less than or equal to Arthur's number (a - k), with `k` being the number of times Arthur's `a` has been decremented in `t` seconds.

### Solution Code

    cnt_pre = 0
    for s in pre_cycle_steps_list:

            sum_pre += s
            cnt_pre += 1
        else:
            break

    remaining -= sum_pre
    if remaining <= 0:

        else:

    return k

print(answer)
```

### Explanation
1. **Cycle Detection**: We track the operations Arthur performs on `b` to detect cycles. This helps in efficiently computing the number of operations and time taken for each cycle.
2. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to find the minimum time `t` where Alexander's number (c - t) is less than or equal to Arthur's number (a - k). The `compute_k` function efficiently calculates the number of times `a` has been decremented in `t` seconds using precomputed cycle information.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach leverages cycle detection and binary search to handle large input constraints efficiently, ensuring the solution runs within the time and memory limits.
