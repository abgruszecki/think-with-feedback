<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum area submatrix of all 1's after rearranging the rows of the given matrix in any order. Hmm. So, the key here is that we can reorder the rows as we like. The submatrix has to be contiguous in columns and rows, but since rows can be reordered, the rows in the submatrix can come from any original rows as long as they are arranged in a contiguous block after reordering.

Wait, right. So the approach is probably to determine, for each column, how consecutive 1's can be arranged when rows are sorted in a way that groups as many 1's as possible. 

Let me think. For example, for each row, we can compute for each column the number of consecutive 1's ending at that cell. Then, when the rows are sorted in such a way that for a particular column, the rows with higher consecutive counts are grouped together, the maximum area would be the maximum for each column of (number of rows in the group) multiplied by the minimum consecutive count in that group. But how do we model this?

Alternatively, here's an approach inspired by the largest rectangle in a histogram problem. For each column j, we can look at each row and compute the number of consecutive 1's ending at (i, j). Then, after sorting the rows for each column j in descending order of their consecutive counts, we can compute the maximum area for that column as the product of the row index (starting from 1) and the consecutive count of that row. The maximum across all columns would be the answer.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when we arrange the rows in descending order for column j, the largest possible height in that column's "histogram" would be the j-th column's consecutive 1's count for each row. Then, the maximum area for that column's histogram (after sorting) would be the maximum of (count * position), similar to the largest rectangle in a histogram problem, but since the counts are sorted in non-increasing order, the maximum area is simply the maximum of count[i] * (i+1) for each i (since for the first i+1 rows, the minimum count is count[i]).

Oh right! Because after sorting the counts in non-increasing order, the maximum possible rectangle for each position i is count[i] * (i+1). Because all the rows before i have counts >= count[i], so the height is count[i], and the width is (i+1) rows. Then, the maximum among all those for each column is the candidate for the overall maximum.

So the steps would be:

1. Preprocess the matrix to compute for each cell (i, j) the number of consecutive 1's ending at that cell. For each row i and column j, if the current cell is '1', then consecutive[j][i] = consecutive[j-1][i] + 1, else 0. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. For each row, we can compute the consecutive 1's in the same row. For each row i, for each column j from left to right, if a[i][j] is '1', then the count is previous count (from j-1) in this row plus 1. So for each row, the consecutive counts are stored row-wise. So for each row, the consecutive[j] is the number of consecutive 1's ending at column j in that row. So for example, a row like '1011' would have consecutive counts [1,0,1,2].

But wait, the problem allows rearrangement of rows. So for each column j, we can collect all the consecutive counts up to j in each row (i.e., the value for (i, j) in the consecutive matrix). Then, for column j, the maximum possible height is the number of rows that have a consecutive count >= some value, and the width is that value. The area would be the product. But how to efficiently find this after sorting.

Ah, right. For each column j, after collecting all the consecutive[j] values from each row, we sort them in non-increasing order. Then, for each position k in this sorted list (starting from 0), the maximum possible area for a rectangle that includes the first k+1 rows is (k+1) * sorted_consecutive[j][k], since after sorting, each row in the first k+1 rows has at least sorted_consecutive[j][k] as their consecutive count (since it's sorted in non-increasing order). So the maximum area for column j is the maximum over all k of (k+1) * sorted_consecutive[j][k]. Then, the overall answer is the maximum of these values across all columns.

So the steps are:

- Precompute for each row, the consecutive counts for each column j (number of consecutive 1's ending at (i,j) in that row).
- For each column j:
   - Collect all the consecutive[j] values from all rows.
   - Sort these values in non-increasing order.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, compute (index+1) * value, track the maximum for this column.
- The overall maximum across all columns is the answer.

This approach is O(n*m) time for preprocessing, O(n*m) for storing the consecutive counts, then O(m * n log n) for sorting each column's list. Wait, but n and m can be up to 5000. So 5000 columns, each sorted with 5000 elements. 5000 * 5000 log 5000 is about 5000^2 * 13 ≈ 325 million operations. Hmm, but 325 million is probably a bit high for Python, which can handle around 1e8 operations in a second. Wait, but 2 seconds time limit. So maybe 325 million is possible, but perhaps not. Wait, 5k * 5k =25 million columns? Wait no, m is the number of columns. So m can be up to 5000. So for each of the m columns, we have to sort n elements. So 5000 * (n log n) where n is up to 5000. So 5000 * 5000 * log2(5000) is about 5000^2 * 13 ≈ 5000*5000=25 million, multiplied by 13 gives 325 million operations. Hmm, which in Python might be tight for 2 seconds, but possible with optimized code.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Let's think.

Wait, but in Python, sorting a list of 5000 elements is O(n log n) but the constants are manageable. Let's see: 5000 elements sorted with log2(5000) ≈ 13 steps. So per column, 5000 * 13 comparisons. For 5000 columns, that's 5000 * 5000 *13 = 325,000,000 operations. But each comparison is O(1), so perhaps in Python it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize this. But I'm not seeing a better approach. The alternative approach is to compute for each row and each possible consecutive count, how many rows have at least that count for each column. But that seems like it would require O(m * max_consecutive) time, which might not be better.

Another thing to note is that for a column j, the consecutive counts in that column are the maximum possible for that row up to j. Because consecutive counts are computed as the number of consecutive 1's ending at column j in each row. So for a row i, if it has a consecutive count of k at column j, that means there's a block of k 1's ending at j in row i. So when we choose to arrange rows in sorted order for column j, the sorted list gives the possible heights. So the approach seems correct.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess the consecutive counts for each row and column. For row i, column j, consecutive[i][j] = consecutive[i][j-1] + 1 if matrix[i][j] is '1', else 0. Wait, but each row is processed left to right, so consecutive counts are per row.

Yes. So for each row in the input:

   row_consec = [0] * m
   for j in 0 to m-1:
       if current cell is '1', then row_consec[j] = row_consec[j-1] + 1 if j>0 else 1
       else: row_consec[j] = 0
   then, for each column j in this row, row_consec[j] is stored.

Then, for each column j, collect all the row_consec[j] values across all rows. Then sort them in descending order. Then, for each position k (0-based) in the sorted list, compute (k+1) * sorted_list[k], track the maximum.

The maximum of all these across all columns is the answer.

Yes, this makes sense.

Now, the code steps:

Read n and m.

Then read n lines of the matrix. Each line is a string of m characters.

Compute the consecutive counts for each row. For each row, create a list of m elements. For each j in 0 to m-1:

   if matrix[i][j] == '1':
       if j == 0:
           row_consec[j] = 1
       else:
           row_consec[j] = row_consec[j-1] + 1
   else:
       row_consec[j] = 0

Once we have all the row_consec values, for each column j, collect all the row_consec[j] from each row. Then sort this list in descending order. Then iterate through the sorted list, compute (k+1) * value, and track the maximum.

So the code structure would be:

max_area = 0

for each column j in 0 to m-1:
   collect all row_consec[j] for each row
   sort this list in reverse order (descending)
   for k in 0 to len(list)-1:
       current = (k+1) * list[k]
       if current > max_area:
           max_area = current

return max_area

Now, the main challenge is handling this in Python efficiently.

But considering that n and m can be 5000, and for each of the m columns, we need to collect a list of n elements. Then sort each list. Then iterate through the sorted list to compute the maximum.

In Python, list comprehensions and using built-in sort (which is Timsort) should be efficient enough.

But let's think about possible optimizations. For example, precomputing all the row_consec values, then for each column j, collect the list, sort, then compute the max.

But let's see:

Sample Input 2:

2 2

10

11

So rows are:

Row 0: '10' → consecutive counts are [1, 0]

Row 1: '11' → consecutive counts are [1, 2]

For column 0 (0-based?), j=0:

All row_consec[j] are 1 and 1. So sorted in descending order is [1,1]. Then:

k=0 → 1 * 1 =1

k=1 → 2 *1 =2 → so max for column 0 is 2.

For column 1 (j=1):

row_consec values are 0 and 2. Sorted is [2,0]. Then:

k=0 → 1*2=2

k=1 →2*0=0. So max is 2. So overall maximum is 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample: Input 3:

4 3

100 → row 0: [1,0,0]

011 → row 1: [0,1,2]

000 → row 2: [0,0,0]

101 → row 3: [1,0,1]

So columns:

j=0: row_consec[j] for rows 0,1,2,3 → 1,0,0,1 → sorted as [1,1,0,0]. Then the max is:

k=0 →1*1=1

k=1 →2*1=2

k=2 →3*0=0

k=3 →4*0=0 → max is 2.

j=1: row_consec[j] are 0,1,0,0 → sorted [1,0,0,0]. Max is 1*1=1.

j=2: row_consec[j] are 0,2,0,1 → sorted [2,1,0,0]. Then:

k=0 →1*2=2

k=1 →2*1=2

k=2 →3*0=0

k=3 →4*0=0 → max is 2.

So the overall maximum is 2.

Which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Now, the code.

First, read the input. n and m can be up to 5000. So the input could be 5000 lines of 5000 characters each. So for Python, reading with input() is possible, but perhaps it's better to read all input at once.

But for code simplicity, perhaps:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

Then read n lines. Each line is a string. For each row, compute row_consec.

But in Python, for each row, we can compute the consecutive counts.

For example:

matrix = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Then, for each row in matrix:

row_consec = [0] * m

current = 0

for j in range(m):

    if row[j] == '1':

        if j ==0:

            current =1

        else:

            current = row_consec[j-1] +1

    else:

        current =0

    row_consec[j] = current

So for each row, we can compute this row_consec.

Then, for each column j, collect all the row_consec[j] from each row. Then sort them in reverse order.

But in Python, for each column, we can collect a list by doing:

columns = [[] for _ in range(m)]

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(m):

        columns[j].append(row_consec[i][j])

Wait, but row_consec for each row is a list of m elements. So for each row, after processing, we can loop through j and append row_consec[j] to columns[j].

But this is O(n*m), which is acceptable.

Once we have all columns as lists, for each column j, we sort the list in descending order, then compute the maximum (k+1)*value.

But in Python, to sort in descending order, we can do columns[j].sort(reverse=True), then iterate through the list.

So code steps:

Compute row_consec for each row.

Then collect columns = list of lists, where columns[j] contains all row_consec[j] for each row.

Then, for each column j in columns:

sorted_col = sorted(columns[j], reverse=True)

max_for_col = 0

for k in range(len(sorted_col)):

    current = (k+1) * sorted_col[k]

    if current > max_for_col:

        max_for_col = current

if max_for_col > overall_max:

    overall_max = max_for_col

So the code structure would be:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

matrix = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

# Precompute row_consec for each row

row_consecs = []

for row in matrix:

    current_row = [0]*m

    prev = 0

    for j in range(m):

        if row[j] == '1':

            if j ==0:

                current_row[j] =1

            else:

                current_row[j] = current_row[j-1] +1

        else:

            current_row[j] =0

    row_consecs.append(current_row)

# Collect columns

columns = [[] for _ in range(m)]

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(m):

        columns[j].append(row_consecs[i][j])

# Now compute max area

max_area =0

for j in range(m):

    col = columns[j]

    col.sort(reverse=True)

    for k in range(len(col)):

        current = (k+1)*col[k]

        if current > max_area:

            max_area = current

print(max_area)

But wait, for each column j, the code sorts the column and then loops through all elements. For m=5000 and n=5000, this would be O(5000*5000 log 5000) operations, which is 5000^2=25 million, multiplied by log(5000) which is about 13, gives 325 million operations. Python can handle that in 2 seconds? Well, perhaps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternative approach: note that after sorting, the maximum (k+1)*a[k] can be computed in one pass. But in code, that's exactly what's being done.

Another possible optimization: during the collection of the columns, use a list of lists, but perhaps pre-allocate.

But in Python, appending is O(1) amortized, so that's okay.

Another possible optimization: precompute the columns as lists, but in the code above, for each row, for each j, append row_consecs[i][j] to columns[j]. So this is O(n*m) time.

So the code is correct. Let's test it against the samples.

Sample 1:

Input:

1 1

1

row_consecs would be [1].

columns[0] = [1]

sorted: [1]

max is 1*1=1 → correct.

Sample 2:

Input:

2 2

10 → row 0's consec is [1, 0]

11 → row 1's consec is [1, 2]

columns:

j=0: [1,1], sorted [1,1] → max (2)*1=2.

j=1: [0,2], sorted [2,0] → max (1*2)=2. So overall max is 2.

Sample 3:

As discussed earlier.

So code works.

Now, let's think about the time and memory.

Memory: each row_consec is a list of m integers (up to 5000). For n=5000, row_consecs would take O(n*m) memory, which is 5000*5000=25 million integers. Each integer can be up to m (if the row is all 1s, then the consecutive count for column j would be j+1). So in Python, each integer is 28 bytes (for small integers). Wait, but 25 million * 4 bytes (if stored as 32-bit integers) is 100 MB, which is manageable. Python's list of lists may have some overhead, but for 5000 rows each with 5000 elements, it's 25 million elements. So the row_consecs would take about 100MB, and columns (another 25 million elements) would take another 100MB. So total 200MB, which is under the 512MB limit.

But in Python, integers are objects, so the memory usage could be higher. However, 25 million integers in a list in Python could be around 200MB (each integer in CPython is 28 bytes for small ints), but for 25 million, that's 25e6 *28 bytes = 700MB. That's over the 512MB limit. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, 25 million integers at 28 bytes each is 25,000,000 * 28 = 700,000,000 bytes = 700MB. That's way over the 512MB limit.

Wait, so this approach would require O(n*m) space, which for 5000x5000 is 25 million elements. So in Python, this is going to use a lot of memory.

Hmm. So this code may hit memory limits. So how to optimize that?

Alternative approach: process each row, compute the row_consec, and for each column j, directly append to columns[j] without storing all row_consecs.

Yes! Because we don't need to keep the row_consecs for each row once we have processed them. So for each row, compute the row_consec, then for each j in 0 to m-1, append the row_consec[j] to columns[j]. Then discard the row_consec. This way, we don't store all row_consecs for all rows, but only per row, process and append to columns. That way, the memory used is O(m*n), but stored as m columns (each with n elements). So the total memory is the same as before, but perhaps in Python, the way we process it can save some memory. Because when we process each row and immediately add to the columns, we don't need to store the row_consec for all rows. So for each row, compute row_consec, then for each j, append to columns[j], then move to the next row. So the row_consec for each row is temporary.

Yes. So the code can be modified to do that. Let's see:

columns = [[] for _ in range(m)]

for each row in matrix:

    compute row_consec for this row.

    for j in 0 to m-1:

        columns[j].append(row_consec[j])

    (discard row_consec)

Thus, the code will use O(m*n) memory for the columns, which is 5000*5000 =25 million integers. But perhaps in Python, this is manageable. Let's calculate: each list in columns has 5000 integers (for m=5000). Each integer is stored as a 4-byte int (if stored as a C array), but in Python, each integer is an object. So for 25 million integers, each taking 28 bytes (for small ints in CPython), this is 25e6 *28 = 700MB. Which is over the 512MB limit. So this is a problem.

Hmm. So how can we reduce memory usage?

Alternative approach: since for each column j, the maximum area is computed by (k+1)*sorted[j][k], and sorted[j] is the sorted list of row_consec[j] for each row. But perhaps for each row, we can compute the row_consec and immediately add each j's value to the columns[j] list, then discard the row_consec. This way, we avoid storing all row_consecs for all rows, but columns is still O(m*n) space.

But even then, with m=5000 and n=5000, that's 25 million integers, which is a problem for memory in Python.

So how else can we approach this problem?

Alternative idea: for each column j, compute the row_consec[j] values on the fly as we process each row, and accumulate them into a list for column j. So instead of precomputing the row_consec for each row, we can compute each row's contribution to each column j as we process the row.

Wait, but how to compute row_consec[j] for each row. For each row, the row_consec[j] depends on row_consec[j-1] in the same row. So we can compute the row_consec for each row sequentially, left to right, and then for each j, append to columns[j] the value of row_consec[j].

Yes. So for each row:

row = input().strip()

current_row_consec = [0] * m

prev = 0

for j in range(m):

    if row[j] == '1':

        if j ==0:

            current_row_consec[j] =1

        else:

            current_row_consec[j] = current_row_consec[j-1] +1

    else:

        current_row_consec[j] =0

    columns[j].append(current_row_consec[j])

So this way, we don't store the entire row_consecs array for all rows. Instead, for each row, compute the current row_consec, and for each j, append to columns[j]. Then, the row_consec is discarded. So the memory used is columns, which is O(n*m) =25 million elements.

But this is the same as before, so it doesn't save memory. But perhaps the code can be modified to process each row as it's read, which would be more memory efficient. For example, if we read the matrix row by row, process each row's row_consec, and then append to columns. This way, we don't need to store the entire matrix in memory. So the code could be:

columns = [[] for _ in range(m)]

for _ in range(n):

    row = input().strip()

    current_row_consec = [0] * m

    for j in range(m):

        if row[j] == '1':

            if j ==0:

                current_row_consec[j] =1

            else:

                current_row_consec[j] = current_row_consec[j-1] +1

        else:

            current_row_consec[j] =0

        columns[j].append(current_row_consec[j])

So this way, we avoid storing the entire matrix, except row by row. But columns still take O(n*m) space.

But in Python, even with 25 million elements, each integer being 28 bytes (for small numbers), it's 700MB. Which is over the 512MB memory limit.

So this approach would hit memory limits.

Alternative idea: note that for each column j, after processing all rows, we sort the list for that column and compute the maximum (k+1)*value. So perhaps we can compute for each column j, the list of row_consec[j] values as we process each row, and then sort them incrementally. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps we can process each row, and for each column j, keep track of a list that is being built, but sorted. However, inserting elements into a sorted list is O(n) per insertion, which would be O(n^2) time and thus not feasible.

Another idea: for each column j, collect the row_consec[j] values in a list, and then after collecting all rows, sort it in O(n log n) time. Which is what we do now.

But the problem is the memory. So how can we reduce the memory usage?

Ah! Here's an observation: for each row, the row_consec[j] for column j can be up to j+1 (if the row starts with j+1 consecutive 1s). But j can be up to 5000, so the row_consec[j] can be up to 5000. So each row's row_consec[j] is an integer between 0 and 5000.

In Python, integers are objects, but if we can store them as a list of integers in a more compact way, perhaps using a list per column. But in Python, each list element is a reference to an integer object. So even if the integers are small, each reference takes 8 bytes (on 64-bit Python). So for a list of n=5000 elements, each column's list takes 5000 * 8 bytes =40KB. Multiply by m=5000 columns: 40KB *5000 =200MB. Plus the integers themselves, which are stored once in the integer pool. Since the same integers (like 0,1,2, etc.) are reused, but for larger numbers, each is stored as a separate object. But for 25 million integers, each taking 28 bytes, that's 700MB. But this is the same as before.

So the code as written may not pass the memory constraints.

Hmm. So what's the alternative?

Alternative approach: for each column j, instead of storing a list of all row_consec[j] values, count the frequency of each value. Then, when sorting, we can generate the sorted list by iterating from the maximum possible value down to zero, and count how many rows have at least that value. For example, if for column j, the maximum possible value is 5000. We can for each possible value v from 5000 down to 0, count how many rows have row_consec[j] >=v. Then, the area for v is v * count. The maximum of these is the maximum area for column j.

Wait, but how to compute this efficiently.

Ah! This is similar to the approach used in the largest rectangle in a histogram when you can use a frequency array. Let's think: for column j, the maximum area is the maximum of (number of rows with value >=v) * v for all possible v. So for each column j, the maximum possible area is the maximum over v of (frequency of >=v) * v.

So instead of sorting the list for each column j, we can compute the frequency of each value in the column, then for each possible v, compute the number of rows with value >=v. Then the maximum of v * count_ge_v.

This would reduce the memory usage because instead of storing a list of n elements for each column j, we can store a frequency array of size up to max_v, which is up to 5000. Then, for each column j, the processing is O(max_v) time.

So here's the idea:

For each column j:

   Create a frequency array freq where freq[v] is the number of rows with row_consec[j] =v.

   Compute the count_ge_v array, which for each v is the sum of freq[v] + freq[v+1] + ... + freq[max_v].

   Then, the maximum area is the maximum over v of v * count_ge_v.

The question is, how to compute this efficiently.

For example, for a column j with rows' row_consec[j] values of [3, 1, 4, 4], the frequency array would be:

0:0, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:2.

Then, count_ge_v for v=4 is 2 (only 4 and 4), for v=3: 2+1=3, etc.

So for each v from 1 to max_v:

count_ge_v = sum_{k >=v} freq[k]

This can be computed by a suffix sum array.

Once we have the suffix sums, we can iterate v from max_v down to 1, compute v * count_ge_v, and track the maximum.

This approach would use O(max_v) space per column, which is 5000 integers per column, and 5000 columns, so 25 million integers. But again, each is a count_ge_v, which is up to 5000, so perhaps stored as 4-byte integers, which would be 100MB.

But how to compute the frequency array.

First, for each column j:

   Initialize a frequency array of size (max_possible_v +1) to zeros. For a column j, the max possible v is j+1. Because consecutive count is the number of 1's ending at column j. For example, if j is the first column (0-based?), then the max is 1. If j is the 4th column (0-based j=4), then the consecutive count can be up to 5 if all previous are 1's.

Wait, for example, in a row with m=5000 columns, all '1's, then for column j (0-based) in 0 to 4999, row_consec[j] is j+1. So the maximum possible value for any column j is j+1. So for column j, the possible values of row_consec[j] are 0,1,..., j+1.

Thus, for column j, the frequency array needs to be of size j+2. For j up to 4999, this is 5000 per column. So for all columns, the total size of all frequency arrays is sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (j+2) = sum from 1 to m+1. For m=5000, this is 5000*5001/2 ≈ 12,502,500 entries. Which is manageable.

But how to compute the frequency array for each column j.

For each column j:

   max_v = j+1 (since the maximum possible consecutive count for column j is j+1, assuming 0-based index)

   freq = [0]*(max_v +1)

   for each row in the matrix:

       v = row_consec[j]

       if v > max_v:

           freq[max_v] +=1

       else:

           freq[v] +=1

But wait, no. row_consec[j] is computed correctly per row. For example, for a row, the row_consec[j] is the number of consecutive 1's ending at j. So for j=0, row_consec[0] can be 0 or 1. For j=1, it can be up to 2, etc. So for column j, the possible values of row_consec[j] are from 0 to j+1.

But when we compute the frequency array, for each row's value v, if v > j+1, which can't happen, because row_consec[j] is computed correctly.

So for each column j, the max possible value is j+1. So we can create a frequency array of size j+2 (from 0 to j+1).

Then, for each row in the matrix, we compute the row_consec[j], and increment freq[v] by 1.

Once the frequency array is built, compute the suffix sums for each v from 0 to max_v. But for the count_ge_v, we need for each v, the number of rows where row_consec[j] >=v.

So for each v, count_ge_v = sum_{k=v}^{max_v} freq[k]

To compute this efficiently, we can compute the suffix sum array starting from max_v down to 0.

Once we have the suffix sum array, the maximum area for column j is the maximum v * count_ge_v for v from 1 to max_v.

But since max_v can be up to 5000 for column 4999 (assuming m=5000, j=4999), this is manageable.

Thus, this approach would use O(m^2) space (sum over j=0 to m-1 of j+1) which is O(m^2). For m=5000, this is about 12.5 million entries, each stored as a frequency count. So for Python, this is feasible.

But wait, how to compute row_consec[j] for each row. Because to compute row_consec[j], we need to process the rows in a way that for each row, the consecutive counts are computed.

So the code would need to compute, for each row, the consecutive counts up to each column j.

But if we process each row, compute the consecutive counts for each j, and then for each j, accumulate the frequency counts for that row's row_consec[j], then we can avoid storing all row_consec[j] for all rows.

Yes! So the code can be:

Initialize a list of frequency arrays, one per column.

for j in 0 to m-1:

   max_v = j+1

   freq[j] = [0]*(max_v +1)

Then, for each row in the matrix:

   compute the consecutive counts for the row, up to each j.

   for j in 0 to m-1:

       v = row_consec[j]

       if v > max_v[j] (which is j+1):

           # which is impossible, since row_consec[j] is computed correctly.

           # So this can't happen.

       else:

           freq[j][v] +=1

But the problem is that for each row, we need to compute the row_consec[j] for all j in 0 to m-1. So for each row, we have to process each j and compute the row_consec[j] based on the previous j.

Which is the same as before.

But the code would have to compute row_consec[j] for each row, and for each j, update the frequency array for that column j.

But how to compute row_consec[j] for each j in 0 to m-1.

Yes. For each row:

current_row_consec = [0] * m

for j in 0 to m-1:

   if row[j] == '1':

       if j ==0:

           current_row_consec[j] =1

       else:

           current_row_consec[j] = current_row_consec[j-1] +1

   else:

       current_row_consec[j] =0

for j in 0 to m-1:

   v = current_row_consec[j]

   freq[j][v] +=1

Thus, after processing all rows, each freq[j] is the frequency array for column j.

Then, for each column j:

max_v = j+1

compute the suffix sum array for frequencies from max_v down to 0.

Then, for each v in 1 to max_v:

   current_area = v * suffix_sum[j][v]

   track the maximum.

But how to compute the suffix sums.

For column j:

max_v = j+1

suffix_sum = [0]*(max_v +2) # suffix_sum[v] = sum_{k=v}^{max_v} freq[j][k]

suffix_sum[max_v+1] =0

for v in range(max_v, -1, -1):

   suffix_sum[v] = suffix_sum[v+1] + freq[j][v]

Then, for v in 1 to max_v:

   current_area = v * suffix_sum[v]

   if current_area > max_area:

       max_area = current_area

Thus, the code would be:

max_area =0

for j in range(m):

    max_v = j+1

    # compute suffix sums

    suffix_sum = [0]*(max_v +2)

    for v in range(max_v, -1, -1):

        suffix_sum[v] = suffix_sum[v+1] + freq[j][v]

    # compute maximum area for this column

    for v in range(1, max_v+1):

        current = v * suffix_sum[v]

        if current > max_area:

            max_area = current

Thus, the overall steps are:

- Precompute for each column j a frequency array of size j+1+1 (0 to j+1)

- For each row, compute row_consec[j] for all j, and update the frequency arrays.

- For each column j, compute suffix sums and find the maximum area.

This approach's memory is O(m^2), which for m=5000 is 5000*5000 =25 million. But each frequency array for column j is of size j+2. Summing from j=0 to j=4999:

Sum (j+2) for j from 0 to 4999 is sum (2 to 5001) → sum from 1 to 5001 is (5001*5002)/2, minus sum from 1 to 1 → (5001*5002)/2 -1 = ?

But for m=5000, this sum is (5000)*(5000+1)/2 + 5000*1 = about (5000*5001/2) +5000. Which is (12,502,500) +5000=12,507,500. So approximately 12.5 million integers. Each stored as a count (probably 4 bytes). So 12.5 million *4 bytes = 50MB. Which is well within the 512MB limit.

So this approach is much more memory-efficient and feasible for the problem's constraints.

Thus, this is the way to go.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

The steps are:

1. Initialize for each column j a frequency array of size (j+1 +1) = j+2.

But in Python, since columns are 0-based, j ranges from 0 to m-1.

So for j in 0 to m-1:

max_v = j+1

freq[j] = [0]*(max_v +1) → indexes 0 to max_v.

Wait, but in code, for j=0, max_v=1, so freq[j] is [0,0,0] (size 2) ?

No, j+1 for j=0 is 1. So max_v=1, so the array needs to be of size max_v+1=2. So indexes 0 and 1. But wait, the possible row_consec[j] for j=0 is 0 or 1. So the frequency array for j=0 has indices 0, 1. So yes.

So for each j in 0..m-1:

max_v = j+1

freq[j] is a list of max_v +1 zeros (from 0 to max_v).

But in Python, initializing a list of variable lengths per j.

So:

freq = []

for j in range(m):

    max_v = j +1

    freq_j = [0]*(max_v +1)

    freq.append(freq_j)

Then, for each row in the matrix:

compute current_row_consec[j] for each j.

for each j, increment freq[j][v] by 1 where v is current_row_consec[j].

But how to compute current_row_consec for each row.

For each row:

current_row_consec = [0] * m

prev = 0

for j in range(m):

    if row[j] == '1':

        if j ==0:

            current_row_consec[j] =1

        else:

            current_row_consec[j] = current_row_consec[j-1] +1

    else:

        current_row_consec[j] =0

But how to get row from input.

So the code steps:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize frequency arrays for each column j

freq = []

for j in range(m):

    max_v = j +1

    freq.append( [0]*(max_v +1) )

# Process each row

for _ in range(n):

    row = input().strip()

    current_row_consec = [0]*m

    for j in range(m):

        if row[j] == '1':

            if j ==0:

                current_row_consec[j] =1

            else:

                current_row_consec[j] = current_row_consec[j-1] +1

        else:

            current_row_consec[j] =0

    # Update freq for each column j

    for j in range(m):

        v = current_row_consec[j]

        max_v_j = j +1

        if v > max_v_j:

            # This is impossible, but just in case.

            v = max_v_j

        freq[j][v] +=1

# Now compute the maximum area

max_area =0

for j in range(m):

    max_v = j+1

    # Compute suffix sum

    suffix_sum = [0]*(max_v +2)

    for v in range(max_v, -1, -1):

        suffix_sum[v] = suffix_sum[v+1] + freq[j][v]

    # Check all possible v from 1 to max_v

    for v in range(1, max_v+1):

        current_area = v * suffix_sum[v]

        if current_area > max_area:

            max_area = current_area

print(max_area)

This approach uses much less memory. For m=5000, the total number of elements in all freq arrays is about 12.5 million, which is manageable.

Now, let's test this code against the samples.

Sample 1:

n=1, m=1

row is '1'

current_row_consec for j=0 is 1.

For column j=0:

max_v=1

freq[0][1] +=1 → freq[0] is [0,1]

Then, suffix_sum for j=0:

v=1 → suffix_sum[1] = freq[0][1] + suffix_sum[2] (0) →1+0=1. suffix_sum[0] =1 + suffix_sum[1] = 1+1=2.

Wait, no. Let's see:

for j=0, max_v=1.

suffix_sum has size max_v+2=3. indexes 0,1,2.

Loop v from max_v (1) down to 0.

v=1:

suffix_sum[1] = suffix_sum[2] (0) + freq[j][1] (1) →0+1=1.

v=0:

suffix_sum[0] = suffix_sum[1] (1) + freq[j][0] (0) →1+0=1.

Then, for v in 1 to max_v=1:

current_area =1 * suffix_sum[1] =1*1=1. So max_area is 1.

Correct.

Sample 2:

n=2, m=2.

Row 0: '10' → row_consec for j=0 is 1, j=1 is 0.

Row 1: '11' → j=0:1, j=1:2.

Processing row 0:

for j=0:

v=1 → freq[0][1] +=1 → freq[0] becomes [0,1].

j=1:

max_v=1+1=2. freq[1] is [0,0,0].

v=0 → freq[1][0] +=1.

So after row 0:

freq[0] = [0,1] for j=0.

freq[1] = [1,0,0] for j=1.

Processing row 1:

j=0: v=1 → freq[0][1] becomes 2.

j=1: v=2. But max_v for j=1 is 2. So freq[1][2] is incremented by 1.

So after row 1:

freq[0] = [0,2].

freq[1] = [1,0,1].

Now, for column j=0:

max_v=1.

suffix_sum is computed as:

v=1: suffix_sum[1] = 0 + freq[j][1] =2 → suffix_sum[1] =2.

v=0: suffix_sum[0] = 2 + freq[j][0] =0 →2+0=2.

So for v=1: 1 * 2 =2.

For j=0, max is 2.

For j=1:

max_v=2.

suffix_sum for v=2: freq[j][2] (1) → suffix_sum[2] =1.

v=1: suffix_sum[1] = suffix_sum[2] + freq[j][1] (0) →1+0=1.

v=0: suffix_sum[0] =1 + freq[j][0] (1) →2.

Then, possible v are 1,2.

v=1: 1 *1=1.

v=2: 2*1=2.

So for j=1, max is 2.

Overall max is 2.

Correct.

Sample 3:

The third sample has 4 rows and 3 columns.

But the code would process each row and compute the frequencies.

But the code is correct.

Thus, this code should work and fit within the memory constraints.

Now, the code in Python:

But for j=0, the max_v is 1. So freq[j] has indices 0 and 1.

For each row, current_row_consec[j] is computed.

The code should handle everything.

Thus, this is the correct and optimized code.
