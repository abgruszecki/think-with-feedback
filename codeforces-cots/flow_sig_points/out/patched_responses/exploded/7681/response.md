Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to generate a fractal pattern after k steps based on a given model. The model is an n x n grid where each cell is either black (*) or white (.). For each step, the white areas from the previous step are subdivided into n² smaller squares, and the model is applied again. The output after k steps is a grid of size n^k x n^k.

First, I need to understand how the algorithm works step by step. Let's see the example. For instance, in the first sample input, n=2 and k=3. The model is:

.*
..

So step 1: the entire grid is divided into 2x2, and according to the model. The model's first row is .*, so the top-left and top-right squares would be . and * respectively. But wait, maybe I need to model each step correctly.

Wait, the algorithm is: each step, for each white square (from the previous step), it's divided into n² smaller squares, and then some are painted according to the model. The model determines which of the new squares become black. So, the process is recursive. Each white square in the current step is replaced by the model, but whether a new square is black depends on the model. If the model's cell is black, then the corresponding new square is painted black; if it's white, then that new square is white and will be subdivided in the next step.

So after step 1, the initial grid (which is n x n) is replaced by the model. Then, in step 2, each white square in step 1's result is replaced by the model again. This continues for k steps.

Wait, no. Wait, the first step is step 1. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Problem statement says:

Step 1: Divide into n² squares. Paint according to model.

Step 2: Each white square from step 1 is divided into n² squares, paint according to model.

Each following step repeats step 2.

So the initial step is step 1. For k=1, the result is the model itself. For k=2, each white square from step 1 is replaced by the model again. So the total size after k steps is n^k x n^k.

The challenge is to generate this grid efficiently, even for maximum constraints. Let's see the constraints: n can be up to 3, and k up to 5. So maximum size is 3^5 = 243. So the grid size is up to 243x243. That's manageable for Python in terms of memory, even using a 2D list. But for n=3 and k=5, 3^5 is 243. So 243x243 is 59,049 elements. That's not too bad.

But how to model the generation. The naive approach would be to represent each step's grid and then expand it step by step. For example:

- Start with step 1: the model is the initial grid (size n x n).

Wait no: step 1 is the first application. Wait, the initial step is step 1. So after step 1, the grid is the model. Then, step 2 replaces each white cell from step 1 with the model again. So each step after the first replaces white cells with the model's structure.

But wait, maybe the steps are cumulative. Let's think of the first example. The input is n=2, k=3, model:

.*
..

So step 1: the entire grid is 2x2, filled according to the model. So the grid is:

.*
..

But then step 2: every white square in step 1 is divided into 2x2 again, and filled according to the model. So the white squares in step 1 are the (0,0) (the first cell is '.') and all cells in the second row (since the model's second row is '..'). Wait, the model's second row is two dots. So in step 1, the entire grid is:

Row 0: . *
Row 1: . .

So the white squares in step 1 are (0,0), (1,0), (1,1). So each of these will be replaced in step 2 with the model. For example, (0,0) is a white square, so in step 2, it becomes a 2x2 grid. Let's see, the model is applied again. So the 0,0 square is replaced by:

.*
..

So that's 2x2. Similarly for the other white squares. Then step 3 replaces any white squares from step 2 with the model again.

But how to model this? The key is to track, for each cell in the current step's grid, whether it's black (so it remains as is) or white (so in the next step, it's replaced by the model). However, after each step, the cells that were black in previous steps are not modified. Only the white cells are further subdivided in the next steps.

So each step after the first only affects the white cells from the previous step. So the process is such that, once a cell is black, it's fixed and doesn't change. But white cells are replaced by the model in each subsequent step.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

Step 1: divide into n^2 squares, paint according to model.

Step 2: every white square (from step 1) is divided into n^2 smaller squares, and painted according to model.

So, in step 2, only the white squares from step 1 are processed. Each such white square is replaced by the model. So during step 2, the model is applied to each white square from step 1, creating n^2 smaller squares. The black squares from step 1 remain as they are.

But wait, in step 2, the entire grid is divided into n^2 * n^2 squares (since step 1's grid is n x n, each cell is either black or white. Step 2's grid is n^2 x n^2). Wait, no. Because each white cell from step 1 is replaced by the model (which is n x n). So each white cell in step 1's grid becomes a n x n grid in step 2. Black cells in step 1's grid remain as 1x1 cells. So step 2's grid has size (n^1 + ... )? Wait, no. Let me see: the initial step (step 1) is a n x n grid. Then, in step 2, each white cell in that grid is replaced by n x n cells. So the total size after step 2 is (n^k) x (n^k) where k is the number of steps. For example, after k steps, the grid is of size n^k x n^k.

So for each step, the grid's size increases. The problem is to generate the grid after k steps.

But generating each step's grid by expanding the previous step's grid seems feasible. Let's think of the steps:

Initially, after step 1, the grid is the model, size n x n.

In step 2, each cell of the step 1 grid is checked: if it's white ('.'), then replace it with the model. Otherwise, it's a '*' which remains.

But for a step 2, the grid after step 1 is n x n. Each white cell in it becomes a n x n grid. So the new grid has size n * n (since each of the n rows in step 1's grid is expanded into n rows, each row's cells are expanded into n columns). So the size is (n^2) x (n^2).

Similarly, step 3 would be (n^3) x (n^3), etc.

So the approach is to model each step's grid, and for each step, generate the next grid by expanding the white cells into the model.

But how to do this efficiently. For each step, the grid is a 2D array. For each cell in the current grid, if it is white, then in the next step, it is replaced by the model. But how to represent the expansion.

Wait, but in each step, the grid is being built by expanding each cell. So for each step s from 1 to k:

At step s, the grid is size n^s x n^s.

But representing this grid directly for each step would require O(n^{2k}) space, which is manageable for n=3, k=5 (3^10 is 59049), but perhaps manageable.

But how to model the expansion. Let's see:

Suppose in step s, each cell is either black or white. For step s+1, each white cell is replaced by the model. The model is n x n, so each white cell becomes a n x n grid. The black cells remain as is.

So for example, if in step s we have a cell (i,j) that is white, then in step s+1, the region that this cell occupied (a square of size n^{k-s} x n^{k-s}, perhaps?) is replaced by the model scaled to that size. Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the replacement is recursive.

Wait, perhaps each white cell in the previous step is replaced by the model. Each such replacement adds n x n cells. So the size grows by a factor of n each time. For example, step 1: n x n. Step 2: n^2 x n^2. Step 3: n^3 x n^3. So for k steps, the final size is n^k x n^k.

The key is to model each cell in the grid after each step. But for k steps, the grid is n^k x n^k.

But generating this grid for k=5 and n=3 would result in a 243x243 grid. That's manageable.

But how to generate it.

An approach could be to model the grid as a 2D array, and for each step, expand the grid by replacing each white cell with the model.

But for each step, the grid is multiplied by n in both dimensions. For example:

- For step 1, grid is model.

- For step 2, each white cell is replaced by the model, each black cell is left as is.

Wait, but how to represent this.

Alternatively, think of the grid as being built in a recursive manner. Each cell in the grid after k steps can be determined by checking whether, in any of the steps up to k, it was painted black. Once a cell is painted black, it remains black. If after all steps, it's still white, then it's '.'.

Wait, perhaps the cell's final color depends on the earliest step in which it was painted black. If it's never painted black, it's white.

So for a cell in the final grid (after k steps), its position can be represented as a sequence of coordinates in each step. For example, for k steps, each cell's position can be broken down into a path of k digits, each representing the position in the model at each step. If any step in that path has a model cell that is black, then the cell is black. Otherwise, it's white.

Wait, that's an interesting idea. Let me think.

Each step, when a cell is replaced by the model, the new cells are determined by the model. So for a cell in the final grid, its position can be determined by how it was subdivided in each step.

For example, let's take k=3, n=2. The final grid is 8x8. Each cell's coordinates can be represented in base 2 for each step.

Let's say the cell's (x,y) position can be written as x = x_1 * 2^2 + x_2 * 2^1 + x_3 * 2^0, and similarly for y. Then, for each step, the x and y coordinates are divided by n^(k-step) to find which part of the model to look at in that step.

Alternatively, for each step s (from 1 to k), we can determine whether the current cell was painted black in that step. The earliest step s where this occurs will determine the cell's color. If none of the steps paint it black, then it remains white.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, for a cell (i,j) in the final grid (size n^k x n^k), we can model its color as follows:

At step 1, the entire grid is divided into n x n regions. The cell (i,j) falls into a particular region in step 1. If the model at that region is black, then the cell is black. Otherwise, in step 2, this region is subdivided into n x n regions again. The cell (i,j) falls into a sub-region here. If the model at that sub-region in step 2 is black, then the cell is black. This continues until step k. If all steps up to k result in white regions, then the cell is white.

So the cell's color is determined by the first step s (from 1 to k) where the model's cell at the corresponding position in that step is black. If all are white, then the cell is white.

This approach is efficient because we can compute for each (i,j) in the final grid, the sequence of model positions at each step and check if any of them is black. The earliest step where a black is found determines that the cell is black.

This seems like a good approach. For each cell (i,j) in the final grid, we can compute for each step s (from 1 to k) which position in the model would have been used to determine if this cell is black.

For example, for step s, the model is applied to the region that was white in step s-1. The cell (i,j) in the final grid is part of a region that was processed in step s. So for step s, the cell (i,j) would have been part of a certain position in the model for that step.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

At step 1, the entire grid is divided into n x n regions. Each region is n^{k-1} x n^{k-1} in size. The (i,j) cell is in region (x1, y1) = (i // (n^{k-1}), j // (n^{k-1})). If the model at (x1, y1) is '*', then the cell is black. Otherwise, we proceed to step 2.

In step 2, the regions that were white in step 1 are subdivided into n x n regions. The cell (i,j) is now part of a region in step 2. The position in step 2 is determined by (x2, y2) = ( (i // (n^{k-2})) % n , (j // (n^{k-2})) % n ). If the model at (x2, y2) is '*', then the cell is black. Else, proceed to step 3.

This continues until step s. If, in any step s, the model's (xs, ys) is '*', then the cell is black. If all steps up to k have '.' in their respective positions, then the cell is '.'.

So for each cell (i,j) in the final grid, we need to check for each step s from 1 to k, whether the model's cell at (xs, ys) is '*', where xs and ys are calculated based on the step s.

Once we find the first such s, we mark the cell as '*'. Otherwise, it's '.'.

This approach would allow us to compute the cell's color without building the grid step by step, which is efficient. For each cell, we perform up to k checks.

The steps to compute xs and ys for each step s can be done as follows:

For step s, the grid is divided into n^s regions. Each region at step s has size n^{k - s} x n^{k - s}.

The coordinates (x, y) for the model in step s can be calculated by:

x = (i // (n^{k - s})) % n

y = (j // (n^{k - s})) % n

So for step s, the position (x, y) in the model is determined by dividing the cell's coordinates by n^{k - s}, then taking modulo n.

If in any step s, the model's (x,y) is '*', then the cell is black. Otherwise, after all steps, it's '.'.

This is a key insight. Because, once any step s in the hierarchy has a black cell, the cell is black. So for each cell (i,j) in the final grid, we can check the model's cell at each step's (x,y) positions, and the first occurrence of '*' makes the cell '*'.

So this approach is O(n^{2k} * k) time. For n=3, k=5, that's 3^10 = 59049 cells, multiplied by 5 steps, which is 295245 operations. That's manageable.

Now, the next question is how to compute the exponents of n for each step.

We need to precompute n^{k - s} for each s in 1..k.

For example, for k=3 and s=1, n^{3-1} = n^2.

But when s runs from 1 to k, then n^{k-s} is n^{k-1}, n^{k-2}, ..., n^0.

Wait, for s=1: k-s = k-1.

But for s up to k, when s=k, n^{k-s} is n^0 = 1.

So for each step s, the divisor is n^{k-s}.

We can precompute these divisors for each s.

But for example, when k=3 and s=1:

divisor = n^(3-1) = n^2.

So for i and j, we divide by divisor, take modulo n to get x and y for that step.

So, the steps are:

For each cell (i,j) in the final grid:

for s from 1 to k:

    divisor = n^(k - s)

    x = (i // divisor) % n

    y = (j // divisor) % n

    if model[x][y] == '*', then cell is '*', break.

Else, cell is '.'.

Thus, for each cell, we check each step s in order. The first s where the model's cell is '*', the cell is black. Otherwise, it's white.

This seems manageable.

Now, the next step is to implement this logic.

So, first, read n and k.

Then, read the model grid, which is n lines of n characters.

Then, generate the final grid of size n^k x n^k.

For each cell (i,j) in this grid, compute for s from 1 to k:

Compute x and y for step s as (i // divisor) % n and (j // divisor) % n, where divisor is n^(k-s).

Check if model[x][y] is '*'. If yes, then the cell is '*'. Else, proceed.

If all steps s up to k have model[x][y] as '.', then cell is '.'.

Now, how to compute divisor for each step s.

But n and k are given. For each s in 1..k, divisor is n^(k - s). But since exponents can get up to k-1 (for s=1, divisor is n^{k-1}).

But for n=3 and k=5, n^{k-1} is 3^4=81, which is manageable.

We can precompute the divisors for all steps s.

So, for each s in 1..k:

divisors[s] = n^(k - s)

But in Python, we can compute this as n ** (k - s).

But exponents can be computed as pow(n, k-s).

But since k can be up to 5, and n up to 3, this is trivial.

So the steps for the code:

Read n, k.

Read model as a list of n strings.

Compute the size of the final grid: size = n ** k.

Precompute for each step s (1 to k), the divisor for that step. For example, for s in 1..k, divisor is n^(k-s).

Then, for each i in 0..size-1:

    for each j in 0..size-1:

        for s in 1 to k:

            divisor = n^(k - s)

            x = (i // divisor) % n

            y = (j // divisor) % n

            if model[x][y] == '*':

                output '*' for (i,j), break.

        else:

            output '.'.

But in Python, exponents can be computed on the fly. However, for k steps, and s from 1 to k, (k-s) can be precomputed as a list.

But for each s, (k-s) is the exponent. So for s=1, exponent is k-1; for s=2, exponent is k-2, etc., down to exponent 0 for s=k.

So, the code can loop s from 1 to k:

for s in range(1, k+1):

    exponent = k - s

    divisor = n ** exponent

    ...

But for each cell (i,j), for each s, compute x and y as (i // divisor) % n and (j // divisor) % n.

Wait, but when s=1, the divisor is n^{k-1}.

For example, with k=3, n=2:

divisor for s=1 is 2^2 =4.

So i//4 gives the row in step 1.

Then modulo n (2) gives x and y.

So for i=5, j=3:

For s=1, divisor=4.

i//4 =1, j//4=0. 1%2=1, 0%2=0. So x=1, y=0. Check model[1][0]. If it's *, then cell is *.

If not, proceed to s=2.

For s=2, divisor=2^{3-2} =2.

i//2 =2 (since 5//2 is 2), j//2=1.

2%2=0, 1%2=1. So x=0, y=1.

Check model[0][1]. If it's *, then cell is *.

Else, proceed to s=3.

s=3: divisor=2^{0} =1.

i//1=5, j//1=3.

5%2=1, 3%2=1. Check model[1][1]. If it's *, then cell is *.

Else, cell is '.'.

So the code works as intended.

This approach is efficient because for each cell, it checks up to k steps, each with O(1) computations. For 243x243 grid and k=5, this is 243*243*5=295245 operations, which is acceptable.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

But wait, for n=3, k=5, the size is 3^5=243. So i and j run from 0 to 242.

But generating this in Python using loops:

size = n ** k

for i in range(size):

    row = []

    for j in range(size):

        # check each step s from 1 to k

        for s in range(1, k+1):

            exponent = k - s

            divisor = n ** exponent

            x = (i // divisor) % n

            y = (j // divisor) % n

            if model[x][y] == '*':

                row.append('*')

                break

        else:

            row.append('.')

    print(''.join(row))

But this could be slow for larger sizes. For example, 243x243 is 59k cells, each with 5 steps. But Python can handle that, especially since 59k *5 is 295k operations, which is manageable.

But the code needs to be optimized. However, given the constraints, even a straightforward approach should work within the time limits.

But perhaps we can precompute the divisors for each step s.

Wait, for each step s, the divisor is n^(k - s). We can precompute a list of divisors for each s from 1 to k. For example, divisors = [n^(k-s) for s in 1..k].

So:

divisors = []

for s in range(1, k+1):

    exponent = k - s

    divisors.append(n ** exponent)

Then, for each s in 1..k (indexed from 0 to k-1 in the list), we have divisors[s-1] = n^(k-s).

Wait, for s=1, the first element in divisors is n^{k-1}.

Yes. So for each s in 0-based index (from 0 to k-1), divisors[s] = n^{k - (s+1)} }, since s in 0-based corresponds to s+1 in 1-based.

Wait, no. Let's see:

For s in 1-based (from 1 to k), exponents are k-s.

So for s=1: exponent=k-1.

s=2: exponent=k-2.

...

s=k: exponent=0.

In the list 'divisors', when built with s from 1 to k, the exponents are k-1, k-2, ..., 0.

So divisors = [n^(k-1), n^(k-2), ..., n^0].

So for each s in 0-based index, divisors[s] is n^{k-1 - s}.

Yes.

Thus, for each step in 1-based s, the exponent is k-s. So for each step s (1-based), the divisor is n^(k-s), which is the same as divisors[s-1] in the list.

So in code:

divisors = [n ** (k - s) for s in range(1, k+1)]

Then, for each s in 1..k (loop over s in 0-based list), we use divisors[s].

But for each cell (i,j), we need to check the steps in order 1 to k. So in the code, the loop over s in 0 to k-1 (since divisors is length k).

Wait, the code for the steps would be:

for s in range(k):

    divisor = divisors[s]

    x = (i // divisor) % n

    y = (j // divisor) % n

    if model[x][y] == '*':

        # mark as * and break

But since s is 0-based in the loop, but the steps are from 1 to k. However, the order is correct: we check step 1 (s=0 in divisors), then step 2, etc.

Thus, the code can be optimized by precomputing the list of divisors once.

This approach would precompute all the divisors once, then for each cell, loop through the divisors in order.

But whether this is more efficient depends. However, in Python, exponentiating is fast for small exponents, so even if we compute n^(k-s) each time, it's manageable. But precomputing is better.

Now, the model is stored as a list of strings, so model[x][y] can be accessed directly.

But for x and y in 0..n-1.

So, the code steps are:

Read n and k.

Read n lines into model.

Precompute the divisors.

Compute size = n **k.

Loop over each i from 0 to size-1:

    build a row as a list of characters.

    loop over j from 0 to size-1:

        for each divisor in divisors (in order):

            compute x = (i // divisor) %n

            compute y = (j // divisor) %n

            if model[x][y] is '*', then append '*' to the row and break.

        else:

            append '.'.

    print the row as a string.

But in Python, generating the rows as strings can be done efficiently.

But how to handle the model correctly. For example, if model is stored as a list of strings, then model[x][y] is the character.

Yes.

Now, testing with the first example:

Sample Input 1:

2 3

.*
..

model = ['.*', '..']

divisors for s=1,2,3 (steps 1 to 3):

s=1: divisor = 2^(3-1) =4

s=2: 2^(3-2) = 2

s=3: 2^0 =1.

So divisors = [4,2,1].

For each cell (i,j), check each divisor in order 4,2,1.

For example, the cell (0,0) in the final grid:

i=0, j=0.

Check s=1 (divisor 4):

i//4 =0, j//4=0. 0%2=0, 0%2=0. model[0][0] is '.', so proceed.

s=2 (divisor 2):

0//2=0, 0//2=0. 0%2=0, 0%2=0. model[0][0] is '.', proceed.

s=3 (divisor 1):

0//1=0, 0//1=0. 0%2=0, 0%2=0. model[0][0] is '.'.

So all steps are '.', cell is '.'.

Another example: cell (0,1) in the final grid.

i=0, j=1.

s=1: divisor=4. j//4=0. (0,0). model[0][0] is '.'.

s=2: divisor=2. j//2=0. (0,0). model[0][0] is '.'.

s=3: divisor=1. j=1. (0,1). model[0][1] is '*', so cell is '*'.

Thus, in the output, cell (0,0) is '.', cell (0,1) is '*'.

This seems to work.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, implementing this.

But wait, in Python, when you have a list of strings for the model, model[x][y] can be accessed as usual.

But need to read the model correctly. For example, the first line is the first row of the model.

So, model is read as:

model = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Then, for x in 0..n-1, model[x][y] gives the character.

Thus, the code should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    model = [input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip() for _ in range(n)]
    size = n ** k

    # Precompute divisors for each step s (1 to k)
    divisors = [n ** (k - s) for s in range(1, k + 1)]

    result = []
    for i in range(size):
        row = []
        for j in range(size):
            for divisor in divisors:
                x = (i // divisor) % n
                y = (j // divisor) % n
                if model[x][y] == '*':
                    row.append('*')
                    break
            else:
                row.append('.')
        result.append(''.join(row))

    print('\n'.join(result), file=output_stream)

Another sample input:

Sample Input 2:

3 2

.*.

***

.*.

model is ['.*.', '***', '.*.'].

divisors for k=2: [3^(2-1) =3, 3^0=1].

For a cell (i,j) in the 9x9 grid.

For example, cell (0,0):

s=1, divisor=3.

i//3=0, j//3=0. model[0][0] is '.', proceed.

s=2, divisor=1. i//1=0, j//1=0. model[0][0] is '.' → cell is '.'.

Cell (0,1):

s=1: i//3=0, j//3=0 → model[0][0] is '.' → proceed.

s=2: j=1 → (0//1=0,1//1=1) → x=0, y=1 → model[0][1] is '*' → cell is '*'.

Thus, the code should generate the correct output.

So the code is correct.

Now, considering the code in Python.

But for n=3 and k=5, the divisors are 3^4=81, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1.

For each cell, the code checks each divisor in order. So for step s=1 (divisor 81), check the model's cell (i//81, j//81). If it's black, then cell is black. Else, proceed to next divisor.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, the code is straightforward. However, in Python, loops can be slow. But given the problem constraints, it's acceptable.

But for Python, the code can be optimized by precomputing the divisors, and possibly using list comprehensions to build the rows.

But even with nested loops, it should be manageable.

So the code will read n and k, model, precompute the divisors, compute the size, then loop through each i and j, check each divisor, and build the output.

Thus, the code should look like this.

To solve this problem, we need to generate a fractal pattern after k steps based on a given n x n model. Each step involves subdividing white squares from the previous step into smaller squares according to the model. The goal is to efficiently compute the resulting grid after k steps.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Fractal Process**: Each white square in the current step is subdivided into n x n smaller squares in the next step, and the model is applied to these subdivisions. Black squares remain unchanged.
2. **Grid Expansion**: The size of the grid after k steps is (n^k) x (n^k). Each cell in this grid can be determined by checking the model at each step of its subdivision.
3. **Efficient Cell Check**: For each cell in the final grid, determine its color by checking the corresponding position in the model at each step. The first occurrence of a black cell in any step determines the cell's color as black; otherwise, it remains white.

### Solution Code
```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
model = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
size = n ** k

# Precompute divisors for each step s (1 to k)
divisors = [n ** (k - s) for s in range(1, k + 1)]

result = []
for i in range(size):
    row = []
    for j in range(size):
        for divisor in divisors:
            x = (i // divisor) % n
            y = (j // divisor) % n
            if model[x][y] == '*':
                row.append('*')
                break
        else:
            row.append('.')
    result.append(''.join(row))

print('\n'.join(result))
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input includes the model dimensions (n) and the number of steps (k), followed by the model itself.
2. **Precompute Divisors**: For each step from 1 to k, compute the divisor which helps determine the position in the model for that step.
3. **Grid Generation**: For each cell in the final grid (size n^k x n^k), check each step from 1 to k. Use the divisor to determine the position in the model for the current step. If the model's cell at this position is black, the cell is black; otherwise, continue to the next step.
4. **Output the Result**: Construct each row of the result grid as a string and print all rows.

This approach efficiently checks each cell's color by leveraging the hierarchical structure of the fractal, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum constraints.
