Okay, let's see. So the problem is about selecting some Hoses such that from each friendship group, either all are taken or at most one. Also, the total weight must not exceed w, and the beauty is maximized. Hmm.

First, I need to model this. The key part is handling the friendship groups. For each group, we have two choices: take all of them (if their total weight is <= the remaining capacity) or take none, or take exactly one from the group (but wait, no: the problem says that from each group, you can invite all Hoses, or no more than one. So for each group, the possible options are: take the entire group (if possible), or take any subset of the group with at most one member. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Mehrdad can invite some Hoses such that from each friendship group, he can either invite all Hoses, or no more than one. Oh right. So for each group, you have two options: either take all of them (if their total weight is within the limit) or take zero or one from that group. But how do you model that?

Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement: "from each friendship group he can either invite all Hoses, or no more than one." So, for each group, it's either take all, or take at most one. So, for each group, you have two possibilities:

1. Take the entire group (sum their weights and beauties). But if the sum of their weights is more than w, then this option is invalid.

OR

2. Take any subset of the group that has at most one member. So this includes taking zero or one person from the group. But taking zero would mean not taking any from this group. Taking one gives some weight and beauty.

But wait, how does that work? For example, if a group has three members, and you choose to not take all, then you can take zero, one, but not two. So, for each group, the options are:

Either:

- Take all (sum their weights and beauties), but this is only possible if the sum of their weights is <= the remaining capacity.

Or:

- Take any subset of the group where the size is <= 1. So, for this group, you can select none, or exactly one member. But when you select one, you choose the one that gives the best possible beauty for its weight. Because if you can choose any one, but you need to maximize the total beauty, you would want to pick the one with the highest beauty in the group, or perhaps the one with the best ratio of beauty to weight, depending on the constraints.

Wait, but the problem says that from each group, you can either take all, or take no more than one. So for each group, the options are:

Option 1: Take all, provided their total weight is within the budget.

Option 2: Take at most one. So in this case, the group contributes either zero (take none) or one member (take one). But when considering all groups, for each group, you have to choose between these two options.

So the problem reduces to selecting for each group whether to take all or take at most one, in such a way that the total weight doesn't exceed w, and the total beauty is maximized.

But how to model this? This seems similar to a knapsack problem where each group has multiple possible options (items) that you can choose from. For example, for each group, you have two possible choices:

1. Take the entire group (if possible) as an item with their total weight and beauty.

2. Take the best possible option of either taking nothing (weight 0, beauty 0) or taking the best single member (max beauty for a single member in the group, with their individual weight).

Wait, but maybe for option 2, the best possible is to select the member with the maximum beauty, but perhaps other members have lower weight but still high enough beauty that when combined with other groups, they might yield a better total. So how to model this?

Alternatively, for each group, when not taking all, you can take any subset of 0 or 1 members. So the possible options for the group in this case are all possible subsets of 0 or 1 members. However, considering that we want to maximize beauty, for each group, when considering option 2, the best possible is to choose either nothing or the member with the maximum beauty, or perhaps the member that gives the highest beauty per unit weight. But how do we model this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps for each group, the maximum possible beauty when choosing option 2 is the maximum between 0 and the maximum beauty of any single member in the group. But the weight would be the corresponding member's weight (if we choose that member). So for each group, when choosing option 2, the possible items are:

- Option 2a: take no one (weight 0, beauty 0).

- Option 2b: take the member with the highest beauty (if their weight is acceptable).

Wait, but maybe there's a member with a lower weight but higher beauty than others. For example, in a group, if two members have (weight 3, beauty 5) and (weight 1, beauty 4), then for option 2, taking the first gives 5 beauty for 3 weight, the second gives 4 for 1. Depending on the remaining weight in the knapsack, one might be better than the other.

But considering that we can't try all possibilities (since there could be up to 1000 groups, and W is up to 1000), we need a way to model this efficiently.

Hmm. So this seems like a variation of the knapsack problem where each item is a group, and each group has multiple options. The classic approach for group knapsack is to consider each group's options and update the DP accordingly.

But here, each group has two options: take all (if possible) or take at most one (so the best possible choice from the group for each possible weight).

So the plan is:

1. Find all the friendship groups (using DSU/Union-Find).

2. For each group, compute two things:

   a. The total weight and total beauty if we take all members.

   b. The list of individual members, but when choosing to take at most one, we need to track the best possible choices. But how to model this.

Wait, perhaps for each group, when choosing option 2 (take at most one), we can represent all possible choices (0 or 1 member) as a list of (weight, beauty) pairs. However, since each member can be chosen or not, but only up to one, the possible options are 0 (taking none) or taking any one of the members. So for a group of size k, there are k+1 options (0 or one of the k members). But considering that for each group, the option 2 gives these possibilities, but we need to choose the best possible subset across all groups.

But with n up to 1000 and W up to 1000, and groups possibly being up to 1000, this might not be feasible if we have to handle each member as a separate item.

Alternatively, for each group, when handling option 2 (take at most one), the possible items are the individual members, but with the condition that at most one can be selected from the group. But the knapsack problem with group constraints where each group allows selecting at most one item is known as the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, in this case, each group has two options: either take the entire group (if possible) or take at most one member. So this is more complex.

Wait, but in this problem, for each group, the options are:

Either:

- Take the entire group (sum weight and sum beauty).

OR:

- Take at most one member (so either 0 or 1 member from the group, but not more than one). So the option 2 here is equivalent to choosing 0 or 1 from the group.

So, the problem becomes a combination of these options for each group.

So the approach is similar to the standard knapsack problem, but each group contributes either their group sum (option 1) or a choice of 0/1 items (option 2). But how to model this.

An alternative way to model this is to represent each group as two possible options:

Option 1: Use the group as a single item with the sum of their weights and beauties. If the sum weight exceeds the current capacity, this option is invalid.

Option 2: Treat the group as a collection of individual items (each member) plus the option of not taking any. But for the knapsack, when processing this group, we can take none (0,0) or take one member (with their w and b). However, since the group's option 2 allows taking up to one, this is similar to a group where you can choose exactly one item (the 0/1 possibilities) from the group.

Wait, perhaps each group can be considered as a collection of possible items, where the possible choices are:

Either:

- Take the group's total (if possible).

OR:

- Take one of the members (including the option of taking none, which can be considered as a member with weight 0 and beauty 0).

But this is tricky. Because for each group, we have to choose between two possibilities: either take the group sum, or choose to take none or one member.

But how to model this in the dynamic programming approach.

Let me think of the DP approach. Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum beauty achievable by considering the first i groups, with a total weight of j. Then, for each group, we can process it by considering the possible options.

But groups can be up to 1000, and W is up to 1000, so the DP needs to be manageable. Let's see: since the maximum W is 1000, the DP state can be of size O(W), but in a 1D array.

But first, let's process each group in turn, and for each possible weight, update the DP based on the group's options.

So the standard 0-1 knapsack approach uses a 1D array, updating from back to front to prevent overcounting. But here, each group has multiple options, so for each group, we need to consider all possibilities of choosing the group's option 1 or option 2.

Wait, but for each group, the options are:

Option 1: Take the entire group. So for the current group, if we choose this option, then we add the group's total weight and beauty to the previous DP values.

Option 2: Take at most one member. So for this option, we can take any of the members (each member's weight and beauty) or take none (0,0). So for option 2, the group's possible contributions are the individual members (each possible choice) and the zero option. However, since taking multiple members is not allowed, but in option 2, we can only take up to one. So when processing option 2, we need to find the best possible selection (either 0 or 1) from the group's members.

But how to model this in the DP. For option 2, the group's possible contributions are the set of all possible selections of 0 or 1 members. For each possible selection (w, b), we can compute the best possible for each possible weight. However, considering all possible members for each group might be computationally expensive if the group is large.

But for each group, when considering option 2, the best possible selection (for each possible weight) would be the maximum between:

- Not taking any (0,0).

- Taking the best possible member (max beauty for each possible weight).

Wait, but how to model this. Let's think: for a group, when considering option 2 (take 0 or 1 member), the group's contribution can be considered as the best possible choice (0 or 1 member) for each possible weight. So for each possible previous weight j, and each possible member in the group (with weight w_i and beauty b_i), we can compute j + w_i and check if it's within the capacity. Then, we can take the maximum between the current DP[j + w_i] and DP[j] + b_i. However, since we can only take at most one member from the group, we need to process all possible members and track the best possible for each possible weight.

But this approach would be O(number of groups * W * (number of members in group)), which could be O(1000 * 1000 * 1000) = 1e9 operations, which is way too slow.

That's a problem. So we need a more efficient way to model option 2 for each group.

Wait, but for option 2 of a group, the possible items are 0 or 1 member. So when processing the group, the group can contribute either 0 (taking none), or any one of its members. So the maximum possible beauty for a group in option 2 is the maximum of the beauty of the members, or 0. But when considering the weight, we need to select the member with the best beauty per weight, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, for each group, we can precompute the best possible options for option 2.

For example, for a group, the best possible option when taking at most one member is the maximum of:

- Taking none: 0 beauty, 0 weight.

- Taking each member: for each member i in the group, (w_i, b_i).

So for the group, the possible (w, b) pairs for option 2 are all the individual members' (w, b) plus (0, 0).

But when processing this in the DP, for each group's option 2, we need to consider all these possibilities. However, if the group has k members, this would require considering k+1 possibilities, which for k=1000 would be 1001 possibilities per group, leading to O(1000 * 1001 * 1000) = 1e7 operations (assuming 1000 groups), which is manageable?

Wait, but the groups can vary in size, and the worst case is a group of size 1000. So for that group, option 2 would require 1001 possibilities. But 1000 groups each with 1000 members would be impossible (since n is 1000). So the maximum total possible members across all groups is 1000. So the sum of (k+1) for all groups is 1000 + number of groups. But since the number of groups can be up to 1000 (if each is a single member), then sum(k+1) is up to 2000 (but that's not possible, since sum k = 1000, so sum (k+1) = 1000 + number of groups. If groups are all of size 1, then sum (k+1) is 1000 + 1000 = 2000). So for each group, when considering option 2, the number of possibilities is O(k+1), but the total sum across all groups is O(n + m_group_count) = O(n) = 1000. So overall, for all groups, the total number of possibilities for option 2 is 1000 + number of groups, which is acceptable.

But even then, in the DP approach, for each group, the processing would involve considering each of the possible options (both option 1 and option 2). Let's outline the steps:

1. For each group, compute the sum of weights and sum of beauties (for option 1).

2. For each group, collect all the possible (w, b) options for option 2 (each individual member and (0, 0)).

3. Then, for each group in order, update the DP by considering:

   a. For option 1: if the group's total weight can fit into the current capacity, then update the DP.

   b. For option 2: for each possible (w, b) in the group's option 2 list, update the DP as in the 0-1 knapsack.

But this would require for each group, processing both option 1 and option 2. However, each group's option 1 and option 2 are mutually exclusive. For a group, you can choose either option 1 or option 2. Wait, no. Because the group's options are:

Either you choose to take the entire group (option 1), or you choose to take at most one (option 2). So for each group, you have to choose between these two options. You cannot choose both.

So for each group, the possible choices are: either take option 1, or take option 2. So this is like a 0-1 choice for each group: do you take the group's sum, or do you select one of the possible (0 or 1) options.

But in that case, the problem is similar to the standard knapsack problem where each item has two options (like a package), and you choose which option to take. However, each group must choose exactly one of the two options.

So for each group, you can model it as a set of possible items: one for the group's option 1 (if possible), and multiple for option 2 (each possible (w, b) in the group's option 2 list). Then, for each group, you have to choose one of these options (either option 1, or one of the option 2 possibilities). But since the group's options are mutually exclusive, you need to choose exactly one of them.

But how to model this in the DP.

Wait, perhaps for each group, we can generate all possible options (option 1 and all option 2 possibilities), and then process each group as a collection of possible items, but with the constraint that exactly one must be chosen per group.

This is similar to the multi-dimensional knapsack problem where each group contributes exactly one item. So the standard approach for the group knapsack problem is to process each group as follows:

For each possible weight in the DP:

   For each possible option in the group's options:

       if adding the option's weight to the current weight is possible, update the DP.

So the code would look like:

for each group in groups:

    create a temporary array to store new DP values.

    for each possible weight j in 0..w:

        for each option in group's options (option1 and options2):

            if j + option.w <= w:

                new_dp[j + option.w] = max(new_dp[j + option.w], dp[j] + option.b)

    dp = new_dp

But this approach is incorrect because for each group, you can select only one option (either option1 or one of the options2). However, the code above would allow choosing multiple options from the same group, which is not allowed.

So the correct approach is to process the group's options as a set, and for each possible j, consider all possible options for the group and select the maximum possible.

But how to model this.

The correct approach is similar to the standard 0-1 knapsack, but here each group has multiple options and we must choose exactly one per group. So for each group, the DP is updated by considering all possible options (either option1, or any of the option2 possibilities) and taking the best one for each weight.

Thus, for each group, we can:

- Create a temporary array (or a copy of the current DP).

- For each possible option (option1 and all options2) of the group:

   For each possible weight j in reverse order (from w down to option's weight):

       if j - option.w >=0, and temp[j] < dp[j - option.w] + option.b:

           temp[j] = dp[j - option.w] + option.b

- Then, the DP becomes the temp array.

But the problem is that for the group, we can choose exactly one option. So the processing for each group is similar to adding all possible options (but only one can be chosen), and the DP is updated by considering all possible options.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to treat each group as a set of possible items (each item being an option for the group: either option1, or each of the options2 possibilities), and then in the DP, for each group, you can choose exactly one item from the group's options.

So the processing is similar to the standard 0-1 knapsack, but for each group, you have to select exactly one of the group's options.

So the algorithm would be:

Initialize dp[0] = 0, and the rest as -infinity or 0.

For each group in groups:

    Create a temporary array copy of the current dp.

    For each option in group's options (option1 and options2):

        For j from w down to option.w:

            if temp[j] < dp[j - option.w] + option.b:

                temp[j] = dp[j - option.w] + option.b

    dp = temp

But in this way, for each group, you can choose any of its options (either option1 or any of the options2). However, this would not be correct, because option1 and the options2 are mutually exclusive. For example, if the group's options2 include multiple possibilities (like taking member A or member B), then the code above allows you to choose both option1 and option2 possibilities, which is invalid.

Wait, no. Because for each group, all possible options (option1 and all options2) are considered, but during the processing, you can choose only one of them. Because the code loops through each option of the group and for each, updates the temp array. The temp array is built by considering all possible options for the group, and taking the maximum possible.

But in reality, when processing the group, the code is merging all possible options (option1 and options2) into the temp array. So for each group, you can choose exactly one of the options (either take the group's sum, or take one of the members, or take none). So the code above is correct.

But let's think of a group that has option1 (sum_w, sum_b) and options2 (0,0), (w1, b1), (w2, b2), etc. The code would process all these options as separate items. However, since they are part of the same group, the selection of multiple options (like taking option1 and one of the options2) is impossible, but the code allows this. So the code is incorrect.

Ah, right. Because in this approach, the code treats all options (option1 and the options2) as separate items that can be chosen, but in reality, for the group, you can choose exactly one of them. So the code as written allows you to choose multiple options from the same group, which is impossible.

Therefore, the correct approach is to process the group's options in such a way that exactly one is chosen. This requires that when processing a group, for each possible option (either option1 or any of the options2), you can choose it, but you cannot choose more than one.

So for each group, the processing must be such that all possible options are considered as a single group. The standard way to handle group knapsack problems where you must choose exactly one option per group is to process all options for the group in a way that they are mutually exclusive.

The correct way to model this is:

For each group, for each possible current weight j in the DP, we compute the maximum value by considering all possible options in the group. That is:

temp[j] = max over all options in group ( dp[j - option.w] + option.b if j - option.w >=0 )

So, for each j, we look at all the possible options in the group and take the maximum possible value among them.

This way, for each group, exactly one option is chosen (the best possible one for that weight j).

So the processing for a group is:

- For each j in 0..w:

   temp[j] = dp[j] (initial value, which corresponds to not taking any option from the group, but that's not allowed because you have to choose one option. Wait, no. Because the groups are processed in sequence, and each group must have exactly one option chosen. Wait, no. In the problem statement, the groups are the friendship groups. So each group must be considered, and for each group, you have to choose either option1 (take all) or option2 (take at most one). But how to model the groups that you can't skip.

Wait, the problem says that you have to choose for each group whether to take all or take at most one. So every group must be considered, and for each group, exactly one of the two options is chosen. So you can't skip a group. So in the DP, you have to process each group and choose one of their options.

Therefore, the initial DP should be -infinity for all j except 0, which is 0. Then, for each group, you process all possible options (option1 and options2) and for each j, compute the maximum possible beauty by adding one of the group's options.

So the processing is as follows:

Initialize dp[0] = 0.

For each group:

   create a new temporary array, initialized to -infinity.

   for each possible previous weight j in 0..w:

       if dp[j] is -infinity: continue.

       for each option in group.options:

           new_j = j + option.w

           if new_j > w: continue.

           new_b = dp[j] + option.b

           if new_b > temp[new_j]:

               temp[new_j] = new_b

   dp = temp after merging with the current group's options.

But how to manage this.

Alternatively, for each group, the processing is:

new_dp = copy of the current dp.

for each option in group.options:

   for j in reverse(w down to option.w):

       if new_dp[j - option.w] + option.b > new_dp[j]:

           new_dp[j] = new_dp[j - option.w] + option.b

But this way, for each group, all options are considered as possible items to take, but since they are part of the same group, the group's options are considered as alternatives. However, the problem is that this code allows taking multiple options from the same group, which is not allowed. So this approach is incorrect.

So the correct approach must consider that for each group, exactly one option is chosen (either option1 or one of the options2).

Therefore, for each group, the DP must consider all possible options, and for each j in the DP, the new_dp[j] is the maximum of all possible options' contributions.

The way to implement this is:

For each group, create a new temporary DP array.

For each possible previous weight j in 0..w:

   if dp[j] is not valid (e.g., -infinity), skip.

   then, for each option in the group's options:

       new_j = j + option.w

       if new_j > w: skip.

       new_b = dp[j] + option.b

       if new_b > temp_dp[new_j]:

           temp_dp[new_j] = new_b

So the code for processing a group would be:

temp_dp = [ -infinity ] * (w + 1)

for j in 0..w:

   if dp[j] == -infinity:

       continue

   for option in group.options:

       new_j = j + option.w

       if new_j > w:

           continue

       if temp_dp[new_j] < dp[j] + option.b:

           temp_dp[new_j] = dp[j] + option.b

Then, after processing all options for the group, the new_dp is temp_dp. But since the group must be processed (you can't skip the group), the new_dp is built by considering all possible options for the group. So for each j in temp_dp, it's the maximum over all options of (j - option.w) in the previous dp plus the option's b.

But this approach is O(number of groups * W * (number of options per group)), which could be acceptable.

For example, if each group has up to 1000 options (if option2 has 1000 members, then options per group are 1000 + 1 (option1)), but that's possible. For n=1000 groups (each a single member), each group's options would be option1 (take all: sum is the same as the member) and option2 (take 0 or 1). But option1 is redundant in that case, since taking the group via option1 would be equivalent to taking the member via option2. So perhaps for groups of size 1, the code would consider both options. But in that case, taking the group via option1 is equivalent to taking the member via option2.

But this would not affect the correctness, as the code would select the best option.

So, the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Find all the friendship groups using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union).

2. For each group, compute:

   a. The sum of weights and sum of beauties (option1).

   b. The list of members (for option2: each member's weight and beauty, plus (0, 0)).

   But wait, for option2, the group can choose any subset of 0 or 1 members. So the options for option2 are (0, 0) plus each member's (w, b). So for the group's option2, we need to generate a list of (w, b) pairs, which is the 0 option plus each member's (w, b).

3. Then, for each group, the options are:

   - option1: (sum_w, sum_b) if sum_w <= w.

   - option2: the list of (w, b) pairs (including 0,0 and all members).

   So for each group, collect all possible options. However, option1 is only possible if sum_w <= w. Because if the sum_w exceeds w, then even if we take option1, it can't be part of the solution. So during processing, for the group's options, we include option1 only if sum_w <= w.

   So, for each group:

       compute sum_w, sum_b.

       options = []

       if sum_w <= w:

           options.append( (sum_w, sum_b) )

       # add option2 possibilities: 0 and each member

       options.append( (0, 0) )

       for member in group_members:

           options.append( (member.w, member.b) )

       group.options = options

   Wait, but this would add (0,0) and all members. But the option2 for the group allows taking at most one. So when we generate the options for the group, option2 is represented by the possibilities of taking 0 (0,0) or one member (each member's (w, b)). So for option2, the group's possible options are (0,0) plus each member's (w, b). So in the code, the group's options are:

   if option1 is possible, add it.

   then add all option2 possibilities (0,0 and each member's (w, b)).

   But then, for a group where option1 is possible, and option2 includes (0,0) and the member's (w, b), but when processing the group, you can choose between option1 and any of the option2 options. But this would allow selecting both option1 and option2 options, which is not allowed.

   So the group's options are: either option1 or any of the option2 options (which are 0 or one member).

   Therefore, the correct approach is:

   For each group, the options are:

   Either:

       a. Take option1 (sum_w, sum_b) if sum_w <= w.

   OR:

       b. Take any of the option2 options: (0,0) or any of the members' (w, b).

   So the group's options are:

   [ (sum_w, sum_b) ] if sum_w <= w, plus [ (0,0) ] and all members' (w, b).

   However, for the group, you can choose exactly one of these options. So the code would generate all possible options (option1, if applicable, and the option2 options).

   But in this case, for example, if a group has sum_w=5, and some member with w=3, then the group's options include (5, sum_b), (0,0), (3, b), etc. So when processing the group, the code considers all possible options and chooses the best possible one.

   Now, the code will process all options of the group, and for each possible weight j, select the best possible option (the one that gives maximum beauty) for that weight.

   So, this approach is correct.

Now, let's proceed to code this.

First, the steps:

1. Read n, m, w.

2. Read w array (weights).

3. Read b array (beauties).

4. Read m pairs of friends and build the friendship groups using DSU.

5. For each group, compute sum_w, sum_b. Also collect all members' (w, b).

6. For each group, generate the options: if sum_w <=w, then add (sum_w, sum_b) as option1. Then, add (0,0) and all (w_i, b_i) for members in the group.

7. Initialize the DP array: dp[0] = 0, others as -infinity.

8. For each group in groups:

   a. Create a temporary DP array initialized to -infinity.

   b. For each possible previous j in 0..w where dp[j] is not -infinity:

       i. For each option in group.options:

           new_j = j + option.w

           if new_j > w: skip.

           new_b = dp[j] + option.b

           if new_b > temp_dp[new_j], update.

   c. Set dp = temp_dp.

9. The answer is the maximum value in dp[0..w].

But how to implement this efficiently.

But the problem is that for each group, the number of options can be up to 1000 (each member's (w, b) plus 0,0 plus option1). So for each group, the number of options can be up to 1000 + 1 (option1) + 1 (0,0) = 1002. But in practice, sum_w may be larger than w, so option1 is not added.

But even with this, for each group, the processing is O(w * options_per_group). For n=1000 groups and options_per_group=1000, this would be 1e6 * 1e3 = 1e9 operations, which is way too slow.

Wait, no. Because n is up to 1000, but the actual number of groups can be as low as 1 (if all are connected). So in the worst case, the number of groups is up to 1000 (each a single node). Then, for each group, the options are (0,0), the member's (w, b), and possibly option1 (if sum_w <=w). But sum_w for a single member is their weight, so option1 is same as the member's (w, b). So in that case, the group's options would be:

option1 (if w_i <=w) plus (0,0) and (w_i, b_i). So duplicate entries. Which may not be a problem, but could lead to redundant processing.

But even so, in the worst case, each group has 3 options (option1, option2's 0, and option2's member). So for 1000 groups, options_per_group=3, leading to 1000 * 3 * 1000 = 3e6 operations. Which is manageable.

Wait, but for groups with more members, like a group with 1000 members. Then, options_per_group would be 1 (if sum_w >w, no option1) + 1000 (each member) + 1 (0,0) = 1002. So for one group, 1002 options, and W=1000. So 1002 * 1000 = 1e5 operations. If there are 1000 such groups, 1e8 operations. Which is way beyond the time limit.

But n is up to 1000, so groups can't have more than 1000 members. But the sum of all members across groups is n=1000.

Wait, the sum of the number of members in all groups is exactly n. So for all groups, the total number of options for option2 across all groups is O(n). Because for each group, the option2 options are (0,0) plus all members in the group. So for all groups, the total number of option2 options is n + number of groups (for the 0,0 per group). Plus option1 options (which may be up to n, if each group's sum_w <=w). So total options across all groups is O(n) + O(n) = O(n). So per group, the options_per_group is O(k + 1), where k is the number of members in the group. So for all groups, the sum of options_per_group is O(n + number of groups). Since number of groups can be up to 1000, sum of options_per_group is O(2000) in worst case.

So the total number of operations is O(2000 * 1000) = 2e6 operations. Which is acceptable.

But let's verify this with an example. Suppose we have 1000 groups, each with a single member. Then, for each group:

sum_w = w_i. So option1 is (w_i, b_i) if w_i <=w. So option1 is added.

Then, option2 options are (0,0) and (w_i, b_i).

So for each group, the options are:

- if w_i <=w: (w_i, b_i) (option1) + (0,0) + (w_i, b_i) (option2 member).

So two entries of (w_i, b_i). So during processing, adding these as separate options would allow the code to choose between option1 and the member in option2, which is redundant. But since they are the same, the code will take the maximum.

But in practice, this is okay. Because even if you have two options (option1 and the member's option), taking either would give the same (w, b) and the code would choose the best possible.

But in reality, if option1 is part of the options, then the group's options are [ (sum_w, sum_b), (0,0), (w1, b1), (w2, b2), ... ].

But for a group of size 1, sum_w is w1. So option1 is (w1, b1) if w1 <=w. Then, option2 options are (0,0) and (w1, b1). So the group's options would have (w1, b1) appearing twice. But when processing, adding both would allow the code to choose between them, but they are the same. So no problem.

Thus, the code will proceed correctly.

Now, the next step is to implement this.

Implementing the DSU:

We need to find the connected components. So each Hose is a node, and edges are the friendships. We need to find the connected components.

The DSU can be implemented with path compression and union by rank to handle m up to 1e5.

Once the DSU is built, we can collect all the groups (each connected component).

For each group, collect all the members (indices), compute sum_w and sum_b.

Then, generate the options as discussed.

Then, process each group's options in the DP.

Now, the code:

First, read the input.

n, m, w = map(int, input().split())

weights = list(map(int, input().split()))

beauties = list(map(int, input().split()))

edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

Then, build the DSU.

Implement DSU:

class DSU:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.parent = list(range(size +1)) # 1-based

        self.rank = [0]*(size+1)

    def find(self, x):

        if self.parent[x] != x:

            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])

        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):

        xr = self.find(x)

        yr = self.find(y)

        if xr == yr:

            return

        if self.rank[xr] < self.rank[yr]:

            self.parent[xr] = yr

        else:

            self.parent[yr] = xr

            if self.rank[xr] == self.rank[yr]:

                self.rank[xr] +=1

Then, process the edges:

dsu = DSU(n)

for x, y in edges:

    dsu.union(x, y)

Then, collect the groups:

groups = {}

for i in range(1, n+1):

    root = dsu.find(i)

    if root not in groups:

        groups[root] = []

    groups[root].append(i-1) # 0-based index for weights and beauties

groups = list(groups.values())

Then, for each group in groups:

sum_w = sum(weights[i] for i in group)

sum_b = sum(beauties[i] for i in group)

options = []

if sum_w <= w:

    options.append( (sum_w, sum_b) )

# add option2 options: (0,0) and all members' (w, b)

options.append( (0, 0) )

for i in group:

    options.append( (weights[i], beauties[i]) )

Now, process each group's options in the DP.

Initialize dp = [ -inf ] * (w +1 )

dp[0] = 0

for group in groups:

    # compute the group's options

    sum_w = sum( weights[i] for i in group )

    sum_b = sum( beauties[i] for i in group )

    group_options = []

    if sum_w <= w:

        group_options.append( (sum_w, sum_b) )

    group_options.append( (0, 0) )

    for i in group:

        group_options.append( (weights[i], beauties[i]) )

    # process this group's options

    temp_dp = [ -inf ] * (w +1 )

    for j in range(w+1):

        if dp[j] == -inf:

            continue

        for (option_w, option_b) in group_options:

            if j + option_w > w:

                continue

            if temp_dp[j + option_w] < dp[j] + option_b:

                temp_dp[j + option_w] = dp[j] + option_b

    dp = temp_dp

Finally, the answer is the maximum value in dp, but if all are -inf, then 0.

But since the initial dp[0] is 0, and each group must choose an option, the answer is max(max(dp), 0).

Wait, no. Because after processing all groups, the dp array contains the maximum beauty for each possible weight up to w. So the maximum possible beauty is the maximum value in dp.

But if all dp entries are -inf, except for 0, which is 0 (if no groups were processed). But groups are all the connected components, and the code processes all groups. So after processing all groups, the maximum is the maximum of dp.

So the answer is max(dp).

But dp is initialized to all -inf except 0. So after processing all groups, the maximum is the maximum of the possible values.

So in code:

ans = max( [x for x in dp if x != -inf] or [0] )

But in Python, max(dp) would ignore the -inf entries? No. So perhaps:

ans = max( filter( lambda x: x != -inf, dp ) )

But if all are -inf except 0, then it's 0. So the code can be:

print( max(dp) if max(dp) != -inf else 0 )

But let's see.

Initially, dp[0] is 0, others are -inf.

After processing the first group, the temp_dp is built by adding the group's options to j=0.

So for the first group, for each option in group_options, new_j = option.w, new_b = option.b.

Then, the temp_dp's entries are the maximum for each j possible.

So after all groups, the dp array has entries that are the maximum possible beauty for each j up to w.

So the maximum possible beauty is the maximum value in the dp array.

But if all are -inf, which can happen only if no group can contribute anything (but since we process all groups and each must choose an option, this is impossible. Because even if all groups choose option2's (0,0), then the total weight is 0 and beauty is 0. So dp[0] will be 0.

So the code can safely take the maximum of dp, and if it's -inf (which can't happen), print 0.

But in practice, the maximum is the maximum of the dp array.

Thus, the code can be:

print( max( max(dp), 0 ) )

But since dp[0] is 0 at least (if no groups are processed), but in reality, groups are processed, so the code can be:

print( max(dp) )

But let's think of a case where all groups choose option2's 0,0. Then, the total beauty is 0. So dp[0] is 0.

Another case: groups have sum_w exceeding w and option2's members have w_i exceeding the remaining weight. Then, the code would have dp[0] = 0.

Thus, the answer is the maximum value in dp, which can be 0.

So the code can safely print max(dp).

But in Python, when all entries are -inf except 0, max(dp) will return 0.

So the code can be:

print( max(dp) )

Putting it all together:

Now, let's code this.

But note that for the group's options, we can precompute them once for each group.

But in the code, for each group in the groups list, we compute sum_w and sum_b.

Then, generate the group's options as described.

Now, code:

class DSU:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.parent = list(range(size +1)) # 1-based

        self.rank = [0]*(size+1)

    def find(self, x):

        if self.parent[x] != x:

            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])

        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):

        xr = self.find(x)

        yr = self.find(y)

        if xr == yr:

            return

        if self.rank[xr] < self.rank[yr]:

            self.parent[xr] = yr

        else:

            self.parent[yr] = xr

            if self.rank[xr] == self.rank[yr]:

                self.rank[xr] +=1

n, m, w_max = map(int, input().split())

weights = list(map(int, input().split()))

beauties = list(map(int, input().split()))

edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# build DSU

dsu = DSU(n)

for x, y in edges:

    dsu.union(x, y)

# collect groups

groups = {}

for i in range(1, n+1):

    root = dsu.find(i)

    if root not in groups:

        groups[root] = []

    groups[root].append(i-1) # convert to 0-based index

groups = list(groups.values())

# Initialize DP

dp = [-float('inf')] * (w_max + 1)

dp[0] = 0

for group in groups:

    sum_w = sum( weights[i] for i in group )

    sum_b = sum( beauties[i] for i in group )

    group_options = []

    if sum_w <= w_max:

        group_options.append( (sum_w, sum_b) )

    # add option2 options: 0 and all members

    group_options.append( (0, 0) )

    for i in group:

        group_options.append( (weights[i], beauties[i]) )

    # process group

    temp_dp = [ -float('inf') ] * (w_max + 1 )

    for j in range(w_max + 1):

        if dp[j] == -float('inf'):

            continue

        for option_w, option_b in group_options:

            new_j = j + option_w

            if new_j > w_max:

                continue

            if temp_dp[new_j] < dp[j] + option_b:

                temp_dp[new_j] = dp[j] + option_b

    dp = temp_dp

print(max(dp) if max(dp) != -float('inf') else 0)

But wait, in the code, for each group, the temp_dp is initialized to -inf, and for each j in the previous dp, and each option in group_options, the new_j is computed and updated.

But this is correct.

Testing with the first example:

Input:

3 1 5

3 2 5

2 4 2

1 2

Groups after DSU:

Group 1: 0 and 1 (indices 0 and 1, which are Hose 1 and 2?)

Wait, the Hoses are 1-based in the input. So when converted to 0-based indices, the group for Hose 1 and 2 is [0,1].

sum_w = 3 + 2 =5, sum_b=2+4=6.

Since sum_w=5 <=5, option1 is added.

group_options includes (5,6), (0,0), (3,2), (2,4).

Then, processing this group:

The initial dp is [0, -inf, ...].

For j=0:

for each option in group_options:

option (5,6) → new_j=5, new_b=6. So temp_dp[5] becomes 6.

option (0,0) → new_j=0 → 0 → temp_dp[0] is max(0, -inf) → 0.

option (3,2) → new_j=3 → 0+2=2. temp_dp[3] =2.

option (2,4) → new_j=2 → 0+4=4 → temp_dp[2] =4.

So temp_dp after group processing is:

temp_dp[0] =0 (from option (0,0)),

temp_dp[2] =4,

temp_dp[3] =2,

temp_dp[5] =6.

Next group is group 3 (Hose 3, index 2).

sum_w=5. Since sum_w=5 <=5, option1 is added (5,2).

group_options: (5,2), (0,0), (5,2).

Processing this group:

prev dp is the temp_dp from previous step.

For each j in 0..5:

j=0:

prev value is 0.

process options:

option (5,2): new_j=5. 0+2=2. current temp_dp[5] is 6 (from previous group), so new value is 2. no change.

option (0,0): new_j=0 → 0 +0=0. temp_dp[0] is max(0, ...) → 0.

option (5,2): same as option1.

So for j=0, processing all options, the temp_dp[0] would be 0 (from option (0,0)), temp_dp[5] would remain 6.

But wait, in this group's processing, the temp_dp is initialized to -inf.

Wait, no. The group processing for each group creates a new temp_dp array.

So after processing the first group (group 1), the dp becomes [0, -inf, 4, 2, -inf, 6].

Then, when processing the second group (group 3):

The group's options are (5,2) (since sum_w=5 <=5), (0,0), and (5,2).

So group_options = [ (5,2), (0,0), (5,2) ].

For each j in the previous dp (the dp from the first group):

j=0:

for each option:

option (5,2): new_j=5. dp[j] (0) + 2 → 2. So temp_dp[5] is 2, but previous temp_dp may have other values.

But initial temp_dp is all -inf. So for j=0:

option (5,2): new_j=5 → temp_dp[5] becomes 2.

option (0,0): new_j=0 → temp_dp[0] becomes 0.

option (5,2): same as first option.

Similarly for j=2 (4), j=3 (2), j=5 (6).

So for j=0:

processing (5,2) → temp_dp[5] = 0+2=2.

processing (0,0) → temp_dp[0] =0.

processing (5,2) → same as before.

For j=5 (current value 6):

processing (5,2) → new_j=5+5=10 (exceeds w=5, so skipped).

processing (0,0) → new_j=5 → 6 +0=6. So temp_dp[5] is max(2, 6) →6.

processing (5,2) → same as first option.

So after processing j=5, temp_dp[5] would be 6.

Thus, the final dp after both groups would have:

temp_dp[0] =0 (from j=0, option (0,0)),

temp_dp[5] = max(2 from j=0, 6 from j=5).

So the maximum is 6, which matches the sample.

So the code seems correct.

Now, for the second sample:

Input:

4 2 11

2 4 6 6

6 4 2 1

1 2

2 3

Groups:

Group 1: 0,1,2 (Hoses 1,2,3).

Group 2: 3 (Hose4).

For group 1:

sum_w =2+4+6=12 >11. So option1 is not added.

group_options: (0,0), (2,6), (4,4), (6,2).

For group 2:

sum_w=6 <=11 → option1 is added (6,1).

group_options: (6,1), (0,0), (6,1).

Processing group 1:

Initial dp is [0, -inf, ... ].

Processing group1's options:

for j=0:

process each option:

option (0,0): new_j=0 →0.

option (2,6): new_j=2 →6.

option (4,4): new_j=4 →4.

option (6,2): new_j=6 →2.

So temp_dp after group1:

temp_dp[0] =0.

temp_dp[2] =6.

temp_dp[4] =4.

temp_dp[6] =2.

Now, processing group2:

sum_w=6 <=11. group_options are (6,1), (0,0), (6,1).

For each j in the current dp (which is the temp_dp from group1):

j=0:

process (6,1): new_j=6 → 0+1=1. temp_dp[6] becomes 1.

process (0,0): new_j=0 →0.

process (6,1): same as first option.

j=2:

process (6,1): new_j=8 → 6+1=7. temp_dp[8] =7.

process (0,0): new_j=2 →6. temp_dp[2] = max(6, 6) →6.

process (6,1): same.

j=4:

process (6,1): new_j=10 →4 +1=5. temp_dp[10] =5.

process (0,0): new_j=4 →4.

j=6:

process (6,1): new_j=12 → invalid.

process (0,0): new_j=6 →2. temp_dp[6] is max(1, 2) →2.

So after processing group2, the temp_dp will have:

j=0 →0.

j=2 →6.

j=4 →4.

j=6 →2.

j=8 →7.

j=10 →5.

But group2's options include (6,1) and (0,0) and (6,1).

But when j=0, adding (6,1) gives j=6 with 1. Adding (0,0) gives j=0 with 0. So temp_dp[0] is 0.

When j=0, the options are (6,1) and (0,0).

Then, for j=6 in group1's dp (which is 2), processing group2:

j=6:

adding (6,1) →12>11, invalid.

adding (0,0) → j=6 → 2+0=2. So temp_dp[6] is max(2, 2) →2.

But also other j's contribute.

The final dp after group2:

possible j's:

j=0: 0.

j=2:6.

j=4:4.

j=6:2.

j=8:7 (from j=2 +6=8: 6+1=7).

j=10:5 (from j=4+6=10:4+1=5).

But the maximum is 7.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code works.

Thus, the code should be correct.
