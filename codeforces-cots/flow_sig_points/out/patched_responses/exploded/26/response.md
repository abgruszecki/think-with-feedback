Okay, let's see. The problem is to generate the navigation bar based on the given n, p, and k. Hmm. So the navigation shows pages around the current page p, with k pages before and after. But there are some conditions. Let's break it down.

First, the example given when n=17, p=5, k=2: the output is << 3 4 (5) 6 7 >>. Wait, so the current page is 5, and it's surrounded by 2 pages before (3 and 4) and 2 after (6,7). But then the << and >> buttons are present only if the first or last page isn't in the displayed range. Like in the first example, page 1 isn't shown, so the << is there. Similarly, page 17 isn't shown, so >> is present. But in the second example, where n=6 and p=5, k=2. The output ends with 6, which is the last page. So >> is omitted.

So the rules are:

- The << button is present if the first page (1) is not in the displayed numbers.
- The >> button is present if the last page (n) is not in the displayed numbers.
- Also, the numbers displayed are from p-k to p+k. But they must be between 1 and n. Also, any numbers outside this range are not shown. But wait, perhaps the range is adjusted to fit within 1 and n. Let's think about that.

So the first step is to determine which pages to display. The initial range is p -k to p +k. But we need to clip this range to 1 and n, and collect all pages in that range, but also, if the current page is not in the middle, perhaps because it's near the edges, the range might be adjusted. Wait, maybe not. Let's look at examples.

Take the third example: n=6, p=1, k=2. The output is (1) 2 3 >>. So the initial range would be 1-2 to 1+2, which is -1 to 3. But adjusted to 1 to 3. So displayed pages are 1,2,3. Since 3 is not the last page (6), the >> is present.

So the process is:

1. Generate all the pages in the range [p -k, p +k], but within 1 to n. Then collect all valid pages in that interval.

But wait, maybe the displayed pages are exactly the ones from start to end, where start is max(1, p -k) and end is min(n, p +k). Then collect all pages from start to end. But also, there's the current page p, which must be in that range.

Wait, but p is given as between 1 and n, so start will always be <= end. So the list of displayed pages is the numbers from start to end, inclusive.

But maybe the example where k is larger than p's distance to the edges. Like the input 8 5 4. Then p=5, k=4. p-k is 1, p+k is 9. But n is 8. So the displayed pages are 1 to 8. So the output is all numbers from 1 to 8, with (5) in the middle. Then, since 1 is present, << is omitted, and 8 is present (n), so >> is omitted. So the output is "1 2 3 4 (5) 6 7 8".

So the steps are:

1. Determine the start and end of the displayed pages.

Start is max(1, p - k)

End is min(n, p + k)

So the displayed pages are from start to end. Then, check if 1 is in this range. If not, then we need to add the << button. Similarly for n and the >> button.

Wait no. Because the conditions are:

- If page 1 is in the navigation (i.e., in the displayed pages), then << is not printed.

So << is printed only if the start is greater than 1.

Similarly, >> is printed only if end is less than n.

Wait, no. Let me re-check the conditions:

The first condition says: If page 1 is in the navigation, the button "<<" must not be printed.

So, if the start is 1, then page 1 is included. So << is not present.

Similarly, if end is n, then >> is not present.

So the steps are:

- Generate the list of displayed pages: start to end.

- Check if 1 is in the list. If it is, then << is not printed. Else, it is.

- Check if n is in the list. If it is, >> is not printed. Else, it is.

So, in the first example, the start is 5-2=3, end is 5+2=7. 1 is not in the list, so << is present. n is 17, which is not in the list (since 7 <17), so >> is present.

In the third example, p=1, k=2. start is max(1, 1-2= -1) → 1. end is min(6, 1+2=3) →3. The list is 1,2,3. So 1 is present → << is not printed. end is 3 <6 → >> is present.

So the algorithm steps:

1. Compute start = max(1, p -k)

2. Compute end = min(n, p +k)

3. The displayed numbers are from start to end, inclusive.

4. Check if start >1 → if yes, then the << is needed (since page 1 is not in the displayed list).

5. Check if end <n → if yes, then the >> is needed.

Then, the buttons << and >> are added at the beginning and end of the output, respectively, unless the conditions are met.

Wait, but the first example has the << and >> around the numbers. So the output is << followed by the numbers, then >>. So the << and >> are at the beginning and end.

So the output is constructed as follows:

- If << is needed, prepend "<< "

- Then, add the numbers, with the current page p in parentheses.

- If >> is needed, append " >>"

But between the numbers, each is either as a number, or (p). Then, the elements are separated by spaces.

So for each number in start to end:

- if it's p, then "(p)"

- else, the number.

So the steps are:

1. Generate the list of numbers from start to end.

2. Check if << should be present (start >1 → because if start is 1, then 1 is included, so no <<)

3. Check if >> should be present (end <n → because if end is n, then n is included, so no >>)

4. Create a list of the elements, replacing p with (p).

5. Then, construct the output string.

So, for example, first example: numbers 3,4,5,6,7. 5 is (5). So the elements are 3 4 (5) 6 7. Then, since << is needed (start 3>1) and >> is needed (end 7 <17), the output is << followed by the elements, then >> → << 3 4 (5) 6 7 >>.

So the code needs to:

- Read n, p, k.

- Compute start and end.

- Generate the list of numbers from start to end.

- Check if << is needed (if start >1 → because 1 is not in the list). Wait, no. Wait, start is the first number in the list. So if start is 1, then 1 is in the list. So if start is 1, << is not present. Else, it's present.

Wait, for example, if start is 3, then the list includes 3 to end, but 1 is not in the list. So << is present.

So the << is present if and only if 1 is not in the list (i.e., start >1).

Similarly, the >> is present if and only if n is not in the list (i.e., end <n).

So, in code:

left_arrow_needed = (start > 1)

right_arrow_needed = (end < n)

Then, the elements are the list of numbers from start to end, replacing p with (p).

Then, construct the output:

If left_arrow_needed, add "<< " at the beginning.

Join the elements with spaces.

If right_arrow_needed, add " >>" at the end.

So code steps:

n, p, k = map(int, input().split())

start = max(1, p - k)

end = min(n, p + k)

numbers = list(range(start, end+1))

left_arrow = start > 1

right_arrow = end < n

elements = []

for num in numbers:

    if num == p:

        elements.append(f"({num})")

    else:

        elements.append(str(num))

result = []

if left_arrow:

    result.append("<<")

result += elements

if right_arrow:

    result.append(">>")

print(' '.join(result))

Wait, let's test this with the first example:

n=17, p=5, k=2. start=5-2=3, end=5+2=7.

numbers 3-7 → [3,4,5,6,7]. left_arrow is 3>1 → true. right_arrow is 7 <17 → true.

elements: 3,4, (5),6,7.

so result is ["<<", "3", "4", "(5)", "6", "7", ">>"].

join with spaces → "<< 3 4 (5) 6 7 >>" → correct.

Another example: input 6 5 2. n=6, p=5, k=2.

start =5-2=3, end=5+2=7 → min(6,7) →6. So numbers 3-6.

left_arrow: 3>1 → yes. right_arrow: 6 <6 → no. So the result is "<< 3 4 5 6" → but wait, p is 5. So the elements are 3,4,5 becomes (5), 6. So elements: 3,4, (5), 6. Then, the result is ["<<", "3", "4", "(5)", "6"], and since right_arrow is false, no >>. So output is "<< 3 4 (5) 6" → which matches the second example.

Another example: input 6 1 2. start is 1-2 =-1 → max(1, -1) →1. end is 1+2=3. numbers 1-3. left_arrow is 1>1 → false. So no <<. right_arrow is 3 <6 → yes. So elements: (1), 2, 3. Then append >>. So output is (1) 2 3 >> → which matches the third example.

Fourth example: input 6 2 2. start is 2-2=0 → max(1, 0) →1. end is 2+2=4. numbers 1-4. So elements 1, (2), 3,4. left_arrow? start is 1, so left_arrow is 1>1 → false. right_arrow: end 4 <6 → yes. So output is 1 (2) 3 4 >> → correct.

Another example: input 8 5 4. start 5-4=1, end 5+4=9 → min(8,9) →8. So numbers 1-8. left_arrow is 1>1 → no. right_arrow is 8 <8 → no. So output is all numbers, with (5). So "1 2 3 4 (5) 6 7 8".

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, edge cases. For example, when p is 1 and k is 0. But k is at least 1? Wait, the constraints say 1 ≤k ≤n. So k can be 1. For example, n=3, p=1, k=1. Then start is 0 → max(1, 0) →1. end is 2. So numbers 1,2. left_arrow is 1>1 → false. right_arrow: end 2 <3 → yes. So output is 1 2 >>. But in this case, page 3 is not in the list. So the >> is added.

Another edge case: n=3, p=3, k=3. start is 0 →1, end is 6 →3. So numbers 1-3. left_arrow: 1>1 → no. right_arrow: 3 <3 → no. So output is 1 2 3. But p is 3. So elements are 1,2, (3). Output: "1 2 (3)".

Another case: n=3, p=2, k=1. start=1, end=3. So numbers 1-3. p is 2. So elements 1, (2), 3. left_arrow: no. right_arrow: no. So output is 1 (2) 3.

What about when the start is 1 and end is n. Then, no << or >>. For example, n=5, p=3, k=3. start is 0 →1, end is 6 →5. So numbers 1-5. << is not present, >> not present.

Now, code. The code seems correct. But let's check the handling of the elements. For each number in the range, replace with (p) if it's equal. Then, collect them into elements. Then, prepend << if needed, append >> if needed.

So the code is:

Read n, p, k as integers.

Compute start and end.

Generate the numbers list.

Check left_arrow and right_arrow.

Process each number into elements.

Build the result list as:

- add << if needed.

- add elements.

- add >> if needed.

Join with spaces.

So yes.

Now, test another case. Let's take input 9 6 3. Output should be << 3 4 5 (6) 7 8 9.

n=9, p=6, k=3.

start =6-3=3, end=6+3=9. So numbers 3-9. So start is 3>1 → left_arrow is yes. end is 9 ==9 → right_arrow is no. So elements are 3,4,5, (6),7,8,9. So output is << 3 4 5 (6) 7 8 9 → which matches the example.

Another example: input 10 6 3. Output << 3 4 5 (6) 7 8 9 >>. Because start=3, end=9. Since 9 <10 → right_arrow is yes. So the >> is added.

Yes.

So the code should work.

But what about when the start is 1 and the end is n? Like when p is in the middle. Then, no << and >>. For example, n=5, p=3, k=2. start=1, end=5. So elements 1,2,3,4,5. << is no, >> no. Output is 1 2 (3) 4 5.

Another test case: n=5, p=3, k=0. But k is at least 1. So no. So k=1. start is 2, end 4. So numbers 2,3,4. So << is 2>1 → yes. >> is 4<5 → yes. So output << 2 (3) 4 >>.

But in this case, the start is 2. So 1 is not in the list. So << is present. The end is 4 <5. So >> is present.

So code would generate << 2 (3) 4 >>.

Yes.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.
