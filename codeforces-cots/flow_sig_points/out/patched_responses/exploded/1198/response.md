Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the longest common substring between two substrings of this huge string generated after 30 steps. The problem is that the string after 30 steps is massive—like 2^30 -1 characters long, which is way too big to handle directly. So we can't generate the string, and we need a smart way to compute the answer without doing that.

First, I need to understand how the string is built. Each step k appends the current string, adds the k-th character of the alphabet (which after 'z' becomes digits 0-9), and then appends the current string again. So, step 1 is 'a'. Step 2 is 'a' + 'b' + 'a' → 'aba'. Step 3 is 'aba' + 'c' + 'aba' → 'abacaba', and so on. Each step's length is 2^k -1. So after 30 steps, the length is 2^30-1, which is way over a billion. So directly accessing any part of the string is impossible.

The problem gives two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2], and we need to find the maximum length of a common substring between them.

Hmm. So the key is to model the substrings in terms of the recursive structure of the string. Because each step is built by combining two copies of the previous step with a new character in the middle. The middle character at step k is the k-th character in the extended alphabet (a-z followed by 0-9). For example, step 30's middle character is the 30th character. Let's see: a is 1, ..., z is 26, 0 is 27, 1 is 28, etc. So step 30's middle character is 30-26=4 → '3' (since 27 is 0, 28 is 1, 29 is 2, 30 is 3). So step k's middle character is determined by k.

So, the structure is hierarchical. Any position in the string can be determined by recursively finding which part it's in: left half, middle, or right half. The left half is the string from step k-1, the middle is the k-th character, and the right half is the same as the left.

So, for any position in the string, we can determine which step's middle it is, or if it's in the left or right part. This seems like a key observation.

But how does that help us find the longest common substring between two intervals?

Well, the longest common substring could be determined by the overlapping parts of the two intervals. Since the string has a lot of repetition, perhaps the maximum possible overlap is determined by the layers in the hierarchy where the intervals overlap in the middle characters, or in the left or right parts.

Wait, but maybe the maximum possible common substring is the middle character of some step. For example, if both intervals include the middle character of step k, then the common substring could be that character. Alternatively, maybe the maximum overlap comes from the left or right parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is determined by the deepest step where the two intervals share a middle character. Because each step's middle is unique to that step and appears exactly once. So if both intervals include that middle character, then the maximum possible common substring is 1 (the middle character itself). But maybe there's a scenario where the intervals overlap in a way that a larger substring is possible.

Alternatively, the longest common substring could be in a part where the structure is repeated. For example, in step k, the left and right parts are copies of step k-1. So if the two intervals are in the left part and right part of some step, but those parts are the same, then perhaps there's a longer substring possible.

But how can we model the intervals in such a way that we can compute their possible overlaps?

Let's think about the intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2]. We need to find a substring of maximum length that exists in both intervals.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows: for each possible position in the first substring, find the character and compare with the characters in the second substring. But this is O(n^2) which is impossible for n up to 1e9.

So we need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the string.

Each step k's string S(k) can be represented as S(k) = S(k-1) + C(k) + S(k-1), where C(k) is the k-th character in the extended alphabet.

Thus, the entire string S(30) is built recursively. For any position in S(30), we can determine its character by decomposing the position into the hierarchy of steps. For example, the middle of S(k) is at position (length of S(k)) // 2 + 1. The length of S(k) is L(k) = 2^k - 1. So the middle is at (2^k -1 +1)/2 = 2^{k-1}.

So, given a position, we can determine which step's middle it is, if any. For example, for position x in S(30), we can find the highest step k such that x is the middle of S(k). If x is the middle of S(k), then the character is C(k). Otherwise, x is in the left or right part of S(k), which is S(k-1).

This recursive decomposition can be done for any position. So, to find the character at a position x, we can recursively determine which part of the hierarchy it's in, until we find the step where x is the middle.

So, the character at any position x in S(30) can be determined in O(30) steps, which is manageable.

But how does this help with finding the longest common substring?

The longest common substring can be up to the minimum of the lengths of the two intervals. But given the problem's constraints, we need a way to find the maximum possible overlap between the two intervals, considering the structure of the string.

Another approach: The longest possible common substring is determined by the maximum possible overlap between the two intervals. Let's consider that the two intervals might have a common substring in the same part of the hierarchy. For example, if both intervals include the middle of step k, then the character C(k) could be part of the common substring. But if the intervals are overlapping in a part that's in the same S(k-1) subtree, perhaps a longer substring can be found.

Alternatively, the maximum possible length could be determined by the deepest step where the two intervals share some overlapping characters in their S(k) structures. For example, if both intervals are in the left part of some step, then their common substring can be found by recursively checking that part.

Wait, maybe the key is to model the two intervals as ranges in the hierarchy and find the maximum depth where they overlap in a certain way. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the longest common substring can be determined by the highest step where both intervals include some part of the middle of that step and possibly parts of the left or right S(k-1) structures.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think of possible cases.

Case 1: The two intervals are completely within the same S(k) structure, but in different parts (left and right). Then their characters could be the same (since S(k-1) is duplicated in left and right parts). So if one interval is in the left part and the other is in the right part, their overlapping regions could form a common substring. For example, if the left part's S(k-1) is identical to the right part's S(k-1), then any substring in one could be matched in the other, as long as the positions are mirrored.

Wait, but the left and right parts are copies of S(k-1), which are identical. So any substring in the left part has an identical substring in the right part. But the positions are offset. So for example, the left part's positions are from 1 to (L(k-1)), and the right part's positions are from (L(k-1)+2) to L(k). The middle is at L(k-1) +1.

So, if the first interval is in the left part and the second is in the right part, then for any substring in the left part, there's a corresponding substring in the right part that's exactly the same, but shifted. So the maximum possible common substring between the two could be as long as the minimum of the lengths of the overlapping parts in the left and right.

But how do we model this? For example, if the first interval is [a1, b1] in the left part of step k, and the second interval is [a2, b2] in the right part of step k, then their positions in the left and right parts are a1 and a2 - (L(k-1)+1). So the left part's position x corresponds to the right part's position x + (L(k-1)+1). So if the first interval's left part and the second's right part have overlapping ranges, their common substring length would be determined by how much their ranges overlap when mapped to the same S(k-1) structure.

But this seems complicated. Maybe the key idea is that any two intervals that are in mirrored parts (left and right of the same step) can share a substring of up to the length of their overlap in the S(k-1) structure.

But how to compute this?

Alternatively, the maximum possible common substring between two intervals is the maximum of:

1. The overlap between their ranges (if their ranges overlap in the original string, but this is only possible if the two intervals in the input have an overlapping range. But the problem states that the two intervals are from two substrings, not necessarily overlapping in the original string.)

Wait, no. The first substring is [l1, r1] and the second is [l2, r2]. So their ranges in the original string could overlap, but the problem is to find the longest common substring between these two substrings. The entire original string is S(30). So the two substrings are parts of S(30), but they might not overlap. So their common substring could be a substring of both [l1, r1] and [l2, r2], which may not be contiguous in the original string. Wait, but a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters. So the problem is to find the maximum length of a contiguous sequence that exists in both [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]. 

So the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum length of a string that is a substring of both of the two intervals. So for example, if there's a substring "abc" that appears in [l1, r1] and also in [l2, r2], then the maximum possible is at least 3. The task is to find the maximum such length.

But how do we model this given the structure of S(30)?

Hmm. One approach is to find all possible positions where the characters in the first interval and the second interval match, and find the longest run. But that's impossible for large intervals.

Alternative approach: The longest common substring (LCS) between two strings can be found using a suffix automaton or dynamic programming, but again, this is impossible for very large strings. So we need a different approach.

The key insight here is to exploit the recursive structure of S(30). Since each step k's string is S(k-1) + C(k) + S(k-1), the entire string is self-similar. So any substring can be broken down into parts of the hierarchy.

So, perhaps the LCS between the two intervals can be found by checking for overlaps in their hierarchical structure. For example, if both intervals include a common middle character of some step, then that character is part of the LCS. Additionally, if the intervals are in the same S(k-1) part (left or right) of some step, then the LCS can be found recursively in that part.

Alternatively, the maximum possible LCS could be determined by the highest step where the intervals share some part of their structure. Let's think step by step.

Let's consider that the maximum possible LCS is the maximum of:

- The maximum middle character that is present in both intervals. Since each middle character is unique, this can contribute at most 1 to the LCS.

- The maximum LCS contributed by the left parts of some steps in both intervals.

- The maximum LCS contributed by the right parts of some steps in both intervals.

But how to model this?

Another approach: Let's model the two intervals as parts of the hierarchical structure and find the maximum possible overlap between any two substrings in S(30). 

But this is vague. Let's think of possible scenarios where the LCS is longer than 1.

For example, if the first interval is entirely within the left S(k-1) of step k, and the second interval is entirely within the right S(k-1) of step k, then the left and right S(k-1) are copies of each other. So any substring in the left part will have a corresponding substring in the right part. The positions in the right part are offset by (L(k-1) + 1). So the first interval is [a1, b1] which is in the left part (positions 1..L(k-1)), and the second interval is [a2, b2] in the right part (positions L(k-1)+2 .. 2*L(k-1)+1). So the corresponding positions in the left part for the second interval are a2 - (L(k-1)+1) and b2 - (L(k-1)+1). If the two intervals' corresponding ranges in the left part have an overlapping region, then the LCS can be as long as the length of that overlap. 

For example, suppose the first interval is [3,6] in the left part of step 3 (which is "aba"), and the second interval is [5,8] in the right part of step 3. The right part of step 3 is also "aba", starting at position 5 (since step 3's length is 7, so left part is positions 1-3, middle is 4, right is 5-7). So the second interval [5,8] is actually [5,7] (since step 3's right part is only 3 characters). The right part's positions 5-7 correspond to the left part's 1-3. So the second interval's left part is positions (5-4) =1 to (7-4)=3. So the corresponding left part for the second interval is [1,3]. The first interval is [3,6], but in the left part of step 3, which is 3 characters long. So [3,6] is adjusted to [3,3] (since left part is 3 characters). So the first interval is [3,3], and the second's corresponding left part is [1,3]. So the overlapping positions in the left part are 3. So the LCS is length 1, which is the character 'a' at position 3. But wait, the original example's first input is 3-6 and 1-4, which gives a longer LCS. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the example again.

In the first example:

Sample input 1:
3 6 1 4

The first substring is positions 3-6. The original string after step 3 is "abacaba" (length 7). So step 3's string is S(3) = "abacaba".

So positions 3-6 are "acab". The second substring is 1-4, which is "abac". The LCS is "ac" or "ab" with length 2.

Wait, how does this fit into the hierarchical structure?

S(3) is built as S(2) + 'c' + S(2). S(2) is "aba".

So S(3) is "aba" + 'c' + "aba" → "abacaba".

So the middle of S(3) is position 4 (since length is 7, so middle is at 4). So the first substring (3-6) includes position 4 (the 'c') and part of the left and right S(2). The second substring (1-4) includes the left S(2) and the 'c'.

But the LCS is 2. How?

Looking at the two substrings:

First substring (3-6): "acab" → positions 3 is 'a', 4 is 'c', 5 is 'a', 6 is 'b'.

Second substring (1-4): "abac" → positions 1 'a', 2 'b', 3 'a', 4 'c'.

The common substrings are "ac" (positions 3-4 in first and 3-4 in second) and "ab" (positions 5-6 in first, which is "ab", and positions 1-2 in second which is "ab"). So the length is 2.

So the LCS is possible because the first substring includes part of the right S(2) (positions 5-6 are part of the right S(2) of S(3)), and the second substring includes part of the left S(2) (positions 1-3). The right S(2) and left S(2) are the same as S(2) is duplicated. So the substring "ab" in positions 5-6 (which are part of the right S(2) of S(3)) is the same as the substring in positions 1-2 (left S(2) of S(3)). So the LCS is 2.

So the key idea here is that the left and right parts of a step are duplicates, so substrings in these parts can be matched if the corresponding positions in the left and right parts are overlapping.

Thus, to find the maximum possible LCS, we need to check for all possible steps where the two intervals have overlapping mirrored positions (left and right parts) and compute the possible overlapping lengths.

So, the approach is:

For each possible step k (from 30 down to 1), check if the two intervals have overlapping regions in the left and right parts of step k. The maximum possible LCS would be the maximum of these overlaps.

Additionally, check if the two intervals share any middle characters (each step's middle character is unique, so each can contribute at most 1 to the LCS).

The maximum between all these possibilities would be the answer.

So, the steps for the solution would be:

1. For each step k from 30 down to 1:

   a. Find the positions in the left and right parts of S(k) for both intervals.

   b. For each interval, determine if any part of it is in the left or right part of S(k).

   c. For the first interval, if it has a part in the left part of S(k), and the second interval has a part in the right part of S(k), then compute the overlap between these parts when mirrored.

   d. Similarly for the other combinations (left-left, right-right, right-left).

   e. The maximum possible overlap here is the minimum of the lengths of the overlapping mirrored regions. For example, if the mirrored parts in S(k-1) have an overlapping length of m, then the LCS could be m.

   f. Keep track of the maximum m found.

2. Also, check for any middle characters of steps that are present in both intervals. Each such character contributes 1 to the possible maximum.

3. The answer is the maximum of all the possible values found.

So, how do we implement this?

First, we need to model each interval as a set of ranges in the hierarchy. For each interval [a, b], we can decompose it into parts that lie in the left, middle, or right of each step k. However, since the steps are hierarchical (each step's left part is S(k-1)), we need to process steps from highest to lowest.

But since there are 30 steps, we can process each step from 30 down to 1. For each step k, we can check if any part of the two intervals is in the left or right parts of S(k). For each such pair (e.g., first interval's left part and second interval's right part), we can compute the possible overlap in their mirrored positions.

But how to compute the mirrored positions?

For example, if the first interval's left part of S(k) is [a1, b1], which corresponds to the S(k-1) structure. The right part of S(k) for the second interval is [a2, b2], which also corresponds to S(k-1) structure but offset by L(k-1)+1. So the mirrored positions in S(k-1) for the right part are a2 - (L(k-1)+1) to b2 - (L(k-1)+1).

Then, the overlapping region between the first interval's left part and the second's right part's mirrored positions in S(k-1) would be the intersection of [a1, b1] and [a2 - (L(k-1)+1), b2 - (L(k-1)+1)]. The length of this overlap is the possible contribution to the LCS.

But this is only possible if both intervals are in the left and right parts (respectively) of the same step k. So, for each step k, we can:

- Compute the left part's start and end (1 to L(k-1)), middle (L(k-1)+1), right part (L(k-1)+2 to L(k)).

- For each interval, find the overlapping parts with the left, middle, and right of step k.

Then, for each combination where one interval has a part in the left and the other in the right (or vice versa), compute the mirrored overlap.

Additionally, the same applies for left-left and right-right combinations, but since the left and right parts are copies, the mirrored positions would be the same. Wait, no. Left-left would mean both intervals are in the left part of step k. So the corresponding S(k-1) parts are overlapping in the same way. So their overlap would be the same as their original overlap. But since the left part of step k is S(k-1), perhaps this is redundant. Wait, but processing step k-1 would handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to process all steps recursively, but considering that each step's left and right parts are copies. So, the maximum possible LCS could be found by considering all possible steps where the two intervals are mirrored in left-right parts, and then the overlapping in their S(k-1) structure.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, the maximum possible LCS is the maximum between:

- The maximum length of overlapping mirrored regions in left-right or right-left parts of any step.

- The maximum number of shared middle characters (each contributes 1).

So the algorithm would proceed as follows:

Initialize the maximum length to 0.

For each step k from 30 down to 1:

   Compute the length L(k) = 2^k -1.

   Compute the middle position m = 2^{k-1}.

   For the first interval [l1, r1], find the overlap with the left, middle, and right parts of step k.

   Similarly for the second interval [l2, r2].

   Check if the middle m is within both intervals. If yes, then update the maximum length to at least 1.

   For each possible pair of parts between the two intervals (left-left, left-right, right-left, right-right):

      For left-right or right-left pairs:

          Compute the overlapping region in the mirrored parts.

          The maximum possible length here is the length of the overlapping region in the S(k-1) structure.

          Update the maximum length if this is larger.

So for example, if the first interval has a part in the left of step k, and the second has a part in the right of step k, then the left part corresponds to positions in the left S(k-1), and the right part corresponds to positions in the right S(k-1), which is a copy of S(k-1). So their mirrored positions in S(k-1) would be:

For the left part of step k: positions a to b.

For the right part of step k: positions (a' - (L(k-1)+1)) to (b' - (L(k-1)+1)), where a' and b' are the positions in the right part.

The overlapping between these two ranges in S(k-1) gives the possible length of the LCS.

For example, if the first interval's left part is [x1, y1] in S(k), and the second's right part is [x2, y2] in S(k), then the mirrored positions in S(k-1) are x1 and x2 - (L(k-1)+1). The overlapping length would be the intersection between [x1, y1] and [x2 - (L(k-1)+1), y2 - (L(k-1)+1)] in S(k-1). The length of this intersection is the possible contribution to the LCS.

So for each such possible pair, compute this intersection's length.

But how to find the overlapping parts of the intervals in the left and right parts of step k?

First, for a given step k, the left part is [1, L(k-1)], middle is m = L(k-1) +1, right part is [m+1, L(k)].

So for each interval [A, B], we can compute:

left_part: [A, min(B, L(k-1))]

middle_part: if A <= m <= B, then 1, else 0.

right_part: [max(A, m+1), B], but only if m+1 <= B.

Then, for each interval, we can have left_part, middle_part, and right_part.

But for a given interval, there might be overlapping parts with the left, middle, and right of multiple steps. For example, a large interval could overlap with step k's left, middle, and right parts.

But since we're processing steps from highest to lowest, we can check each step's parts.

So, for each step k from 30 down to 1:

   Compute L(k) = 2^k -1. But wait, since k can be up to 30, L(30) is 2^30-1 which is manageable as a number (though it's a very big number, but we can compute it as 1 << 30).

   Compute m = L(k-1) + 1. Because L(k) is 2^k -1, so L(k-1) is 2^{k-1} -1. m = (2^{k-1} -1) + 1 = 2^{k-1}.

   Now, check if the first interval [l1, r1] overlaps with the left part of step k: if l1 <= L(k-1) and r1 >=1. So the left part of step k is [1, L(k-1)].

   The left part of the first interval in step k would be [a1_left, b1_left] = [max(l1, 1), min(r1, L(k-1))].

   Similarly for the middle: check if m is between l1 and r1.

   For the right part: the right part starts at m+1, which is L(k-1) +2, and ends at L(k) = 2^k -1.

   So, right part for first interval is [a1_right, b1_right] = [max(l1, m+1), min(r1, L(k))].

   Do the same for the second interval [l2, r2], getting a2_left, b2_left; a2_right, b2_right.

   Now, for the middle part: if m is within both intervals, then the current maximum can be at least 1.

   Now, check the left-right pairs:

   For the first interval's left part and second's right part:

      If a1_left <= b1_left (i.e., the first interval has some overlap with the left part of step k) and a2_right <= b2_right (second has some overlap with right part), then compute the mirrored positions.

      The mirrored positions for the right part of the second interval are a2_right - m, b2_right - m. Because the right part's positions start at m+1, so subtracting m gives the corresponding left part's positions.

      For example, position m+1 is 1 in the left part, m+2 is 2, etc.

      So the mirrored positions for the second interval's right part are [a2_right - m, b2_right - m].

      The overlapping between [a1_left, b1_left] and [a2_right -m, b2_right -m] is the intersection of these two ranges. The length of this intersection is (overlap_end - overlap_start +1) if overlap_start <= overlap_end. This length contributes to the LCS.

      We take the maximum of this value and the current maximum.

   Similarly, check for the first interval's right part and the second's left part.

   Also, check for left-left and right-right pairs. But in these cases, since the left part of step k is the same as the left part of step k (since it's S(k-1)), then any overlapping in left-left would be handled recursively in lower steps. So maybe we don't need to process them here, as they would be handled when we process step k-1. But perhaps processing them here could allow us to find larger overlaps.

   For example, if both intervals are in the left part of step k, then their overlapping in S(k-1) could be processed when k is 30, 29, etc. However, maybe processing them here could help find the maximum possible overlap. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible overlap can only be found by considering steps in descending order. For example, if there's an overlap in step k's left-right parts, it's possible that the overlapping length is larger than any possible overlaps in lower steps. So processing higher steps first allows us to find the maximum possible overlap early.

So, in the algorithm:

For each step k from 30 down to 1:

   Check the left-right and right-left pairs between the two intervals in step k's parts.

   Compute the possible overlapping lengths.

   Update the maximum length.

   Also, check if the middle character is in both intervals and update the maximum to at least 1.

Once all steps are processed, the maximum length found is the answer.

Additionally, if the two intervals overlap in the original string (i.e., [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] have an overlapping range), then the maximum possible LCS could be up to the length of the overlapping region. But how can this be handled?

Wait, no. Because even if the two intervals overlap in the original string, the overlapping part is a substring of both intervals, so its length would be the minimum of (r1, r2) - max(l1, l2) +1. But that's only if they overlap. So for example, if the two intervals are [3,6] and [5, 8], their overlapping is [5,6], so the length is 2. But if the overlapping part is part of the same structure, then the LCS is 2. But how does this fit into the algorithm?

Ah, but the algorithm's step-based processing would not automatically capture this. Because the overlapping part is part of the original string, but the steps' left-right processing may not capture this if the overlapping is not due to mirrored parts.

Wait, but in the original string, the overlapping could be part of the same left or right part of a higher step. For example, the overlapping part could be in the left part of step 30, and thus the algorithm would capture it when processing step 30. But if the overlapping part is in the left part of step 30, then the algorithm would check for left-left pairs, but since the left part is part of step 30's left part, which is S(29), then processing step 30's left part would not capture the overlapping part's mirrored positions. However, the overlapping part could be handled in step 29's processing.

Hmm. So perhaps the algorithm as described would not capture overlaps in the same part of a higher step.

So, to handle this case, we need to check if the two intervals have any overlapping regions in the original string. The maximum possible LCS would be the maximum between the algorithm's current maximum and the overlapping region's length.

Wait, but the overlapping region's length is the length of the intersection between the two intervals. So if the two intervals have an overlapping range, then the maximum possible LCS could be up to that length. But that's true only if all characters in that overlapping range are the same. Which is not the case. For example, if the overlapping range is 3 characters, but the first two are 'a' and 'b' and the third is 'a', then the LCS between the two intervals is at least 1, but possibly more.

But how to find the LCS length in that overlapping region? Since the overlapping region is part of both intervals, any substring within that overlapping region is a common substring. So the maximum possible length would be the length of the overlapping region. For example, if the overlapping region is 5 characters long, then the maximum possible LCS is 5, provided that the entire 5-character sequence exists in both intervals. But since the overlapping region is part of both intervals, the entire 5-character sequence is present in both, so the LCS would be 5.

Ah, right! Because the overlapping region is part of both intervals, so the entire overlapping region is a common substring. So the maximum possible LCS is at least the length of the overlapping region. Thus, the maximum possible LCS is the maximum between the overlapping region's length and the algorithm's current maximum.

So the algorithm must also compute the overlapping region between the two intervals and compare it to the maximum found by the step-based processing.

So the steps of the algorithm are:

1. Compute the overlapping range between the two intervals (if any), and compute its length. Let's call this 'overlap_len'.

2. Initialize the maximum length as 'overlap_len'.

3. For each step k from 30 down to 1:

   a. Compute the current step's L(k), m = 2^{k-1}.

   b. Check if the middle m is in both intervals. If yes, then current max could be at least 1. So update 'current_max' to max(current_max, 1).

   c. Compute for each interval the left, middle, right parts in step k.

   d. For the left part of interval 1 and right part of interval 2:

      i. If both have overlapping ranges, compute the mirrored positions in S(k-1).

      ii. Compute the intersection of these mirrored ranges.

      iii. The length of the intersection is a candidate for the LCS. Update 'current_max' if this is larger.

   e. Similarly for the right part of interval 1 and left part of interval 2.

   f. For each of these combinations, compute the possible mirrored overlap and update the 'current_max'.

4. The final answer is the maximum between 'overlap_len' and the maximum found in step 3.

But how do we compute the overlapping region between the two intervals?

The overlapping region is the intersection of [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]. So:

start = max(l1, l2)
end = min(r1, r2)
overlap_len = max(0, end - start + 1)

If start > end, overlap_len is 0.

So this is a crucial part. For example, in the first sample input:

l1=3, r1=6; l2=1, r2=4.

The overlapping range is [3,4], which has a length of 2. Which matches the sample's output. So the 'overlap_len' would be 2, and the algorithm's other steps may find that mirrored parts contribute 2, but in this case, the overlap_len is already 2.

So, in the first sample, the maximum is 2, which comes from the overlapping region. But according to the sample explanation, the two intervals have a common substring of length 2. So the algorithm's initial 'overlap_len' is 2, and it's the correct answer.

But wait, the overlapping region is [3,4], which is "ac". The first interval is 3-6 (characters 'acab'), and the second is 1-4 ('abac'). The overlapping region is positions 3-4, which is 'ac' and 'ac' in their respective substrings, so the length is 2.

So in this case, the overlap_len is 2, which is the correct answer.

In the second sample, the two intervals [1,1] and [4,4] do not overlap, so overlap_len is 0. The step-based processing finds that there are no overlapping mirrored parts and no shared middle characters, so the answer is 0.

So the key is to first compute the overlap_len and then compare it with the maximum found by the step-based processing.

Thus, the algorithm's steps are:

Compute overlap_len = max(0, min(r1, r2) - max(l1, l2) + 1) if max(l1, l2) <= min(r1, r2).

Initialize max_len = overlap_len.

Then, for each step k from 30 down to 1:

   Check if the middle character of step k is in both intervals. If yes, then max_len = max(max_len, 1).

   For each pair of parts (left1 and right2, right1 and left2):

      Compute the overlapping ranges in the mirrored parts.

      The length of this overlapping is a candidate for the max_len.

So, how to compute this for each pair.

Let's take the example of step k=3:

The first interval's left part is [3,3], since step 3's left part is 1-3. The second interval's right part in step 3 is 5-7. So for the second interval's right part (if it's part of the right part of step 3), mirrored positions are 5-7 - 4 (since m=4) → 1-3. The first interval's left part is [3,3], and the mirrored right part is 1-3. So the intersection is [3,3] and [1-3]. So the overlapping length is 1. But the first interval's left part is 3 (from step 3's left part), which is the third position of the left S(2) (which is "aba"). The mirrored right part is positions 5-7, which are 1-3 of S(2) again. So the first interval's left part is position 3 in S(3)'s left part → which is the third character of S(2) → 'a'. The mirrored right part of the second interval's right part is 1-3 (positions 5-7 in S(3)), which is 'a', 'b', 'a' again. So if the second interval's right part includes position 5 (which is 'a'), then the overlapping is 1.

But in the first sample, the second interval is [1-4], which includes the middle of step 3 (position4). So the right part of step3 starts at position5. So the second interval doesn't overlap with the right part of step3. So in this case, the step3 processing would not contribute to the maximum.

But why then in the first sample the maximum is 2?

Ah, because the overlapping region's length is 2, which is already captured by the overlap_len.

Thus, the algorithm works.

Now, how to implement this.

Implementing step processing:

For each step k from 30 downto 1:

   Compute L(k) = 2^k -1.

   m = 2^{k-1}

   Check if m is within both intervals. If l1 <= m <= r1 and l2 <= m <= r2, then current_max = max(current_max, 1).

   Now, process left and right parts for both intervals.

For each interval (i in 1, 2):

   For interval i, compute the left part in step k.

   left_start = 1

   left_end = L(k-1) = (2^(k-1) -1)

   left_part for interval i is [max(l_i, left_start), min(r_i, left_end)]

   if left_part's start > left_part's end, then no overlap in left.

Similarly for right part.

Once left_part for both intervals are computed, and right_part for both intervals are computed.

For the combination of interval1's left and interval2's right:

if interval1 has left_part (a1, b1) and interval2 has right_part (a2, b2):

   mirrored_a2 = a2 - m

   mirrored_b2 = b2 - m

   Now, compute the intersection between [a1, b1] and [mirrored_a2, mirrored_b2]

   overlap_start = max(a1, mirrored_a2)

   overlap_end = min(b1, mirrored_b2)

   if overlap_start <= overlap_end:

      candidate = overlap_end - overlap_start + 1

      if candidate > current_max:

         current_max = candidate

Similarly for the combination of interval1's right and interval2's left:

mirrored_a1 = a1_right - m

mirrored_b1 = b1_right - m

intersection with interval2's left_part [a2_left, b2_left] and [mirrored_a1, mirrored_b1]

overlap_start = max(a2_left, mirrored_a1)

overlap_end = min(b2_left, mirrored_b1)

if overlap_start <= overlap_end:

   candidate = overlap_end - overlap_start +1

   if candidate > current_max:

      current_max = candidate

But wait, for the interval1's right part:

The right part of step k is [m+1, L(k)]. So for the right_part of interval1, the positions are [a1_right, b1_right] = [max(l1, m+1), min(r1, L(k))].

To mirror these positions to the left part of step k (which is S(k-1)), subtract (m+1) from them. Because the right part of step k is a copy of S(k-1), but shifted by (m+1) positions. So a1_right in the right part is equivalent to (a1_right - m) in the left part. For example, position m+1 is equivalent to 1 in the left part, m+2 → 2, etc.

So, for interval1's right_part in step k:

mirrored_a1 = a1_right - m

mirrored_b1 = b1_right - m

So, the mirrored positions are [mirrored_a1, mirrored_b1], which correspond to the left part of step k.

Similarly, interval2's right_part is mirrored by subtracting m.

So, when combining interval1's left_part with interval2's right_part:

interval1's left_part is [a1, b1] in the left part of step k (which is S(k-1)).

interval2's right_part's mirrored positions are [a2 - m, b2 -m], which also refer to S(k-1).

The intersection of these two ranges gives the overlapping length in S(k-1), which is a possible candidate for the LCS.

So, the code for each step k:

Compute L_prev = 2^{k-1} -1.

m = L_prev +1 = 2^{k-1}

For each interval (1 and 2):

   left_part_start = max(l_i, 1)

   left_part_end = min(r_i, L_prev)

   left_part_valid = left_part_start <= left_part_end

   right_part_start = max(l_i, m+1)

   right_part_end = min(r_i, 2^{k} -1)

   right_part_valid = right_part_start <= right_part_end

So, for interval1 and interval2, compute their left_part and right_part in step k.

Then, for pairs (left1 and right2, right1 and left2):

For example:

If interval1's left_part is valid and interval2's right_part is valid:

   a1 = interval1's left_part_start

   b1 = interval1's left_part_end

   a2 = interval2's right_part_start

   b2 = interval2's right_part_end

   mirrored_a2 = a2 - m

   mirrored_b2 = b2 - m

   overlap_start = max(a1, mirrored_a2)

   overlap_end = min(b1, mirrored_b2)

   if overlap_start <= overlap_end:

      candidate = overlap_end - overlap_start +1

      if candidate > current_max:

         current_max = candidate

Similarly, for interval1's right_part and interval2's left_part:

   a1 = interval1's right_part_start

   b1 = interval1's right_part_end

   mirrored_a1 = a1 - m

   mirrored_b1 = b1 - m

   a2 = interval2's left_part_start

   b2 = interval2's left_part_end

   overlap_start = max(a2, mirrored_a1)

   overlap_end = min(b2, mirrored_b1)

   if overlap_start <= overlap_end:

      candidate = overlap_end - overlap_start +1

      if candidate > current_max:

         current_max = candidate

But wait, for the mirrored_a1 and mirrored_b1:

interval1's right_part starts at m+1. So m+1 is the first position of the right_part. mirrored_a1 is (m+1) - m = 1. Similarly, the right_part's positions correspond to the left_part's positions plus m.

So, for any position x in the right_part of step k, the corresponding mirrored position in the left_part is x - m.

So the code for mirrored_a2 and mirrored_b2 is correct.

So, now, the code needs to process all steps from 30 down to 1, and for each step, check the middle character and the left-right pairs.

Now, the code implementation:

First, precompute L_prev for each step k. But since k ranges up to 30, 2^30 is manageable as integers in Python.

But to compute L(k), which is 2^k -1. So for step k, L_prev = 2^{k-1} -1, m = 2^{k-1}.

So for k in 30 downto 1:

   L_prev = (1 << (k-1)) -1

   m = 1 << (k-1)

   L_k = (1 <<k ) -1

But wait, L(k) is 2^k -1, so for step k, L_prev is L(k-1).

Now, for each step, we need to compute the left part (1 to L_prev), middle m, and right part (m+1 to L_k).

So, for each step k:

   m = 2^{k-1}

   L_prev = m -1 (since L(k-1) = 2^{k-1} -1).

   L_k = 2*m -1.

So, for each step k, these values can be computed.

Now, the code structure:

Read l1, r1, l2, r2.

Compute overlap_len:

start = max(l1, l2)

end = min(r1, r2)

if start > end:

   overlap_len =0

else:

   overlap_len = end - start +1

max_len = overlap_len

for k in range(30, 0, -1):

   m = 1 << (k-1)

   L_prev = m -1

   # check if middle m is in both intervals

   if (l1 <= m <= r1) and (l2 <= m <= r2):

      if max_len < 1:

         max_len = 1

   # compute left and right parts for each interval in this step

   # interval 1:

   left1_start = max(l1, 1)

   left1_end = min(r1, L_prev)

   has_left1 = left1_start <= left1_end

   right1_start = max(l1, m+1)

   right1_end = min(r1, (1 <<k ) -1 )

   has_right1 = right1_start <= right1_end

   # interval2:

   left2_start = max(l2, 1)

   left2_end = min(r2, L_prev)

   has_left2 = left2_start <= left2_end

   right2_start = max(l2, m+1)

   right2_end = min(r2, (1 <<k ) -1 )

   has_right2 = right2_start <= right2_end

   # check left1 and right2:

   if has_left1 and has_right2:

      a1 = left1_start

      b1 = left1_end

      a2 = right2_start

      b2 = right2_end

      # mirrored a2 and b2:

      ma2 = a2 - m

      mb2 = b2 - m

      # intersection with a1..b1 and ma2..mb2:

      os = max(a1, ma2)

      oe = min(b1, mb2)

      if os <= oe:

         candidate = oe - os +1

         if candidate > max_len:

            max_len = candidate

   # check right1 and left2:

   if has_right1 and has_left2:

      a1 = right1_start

      b1 = right1_end

      ma1 = a1 - m

      mb1 = b1 - m

      a2 = left2_start

      b2 = left2_end

      os = max(a2, ma1)

      oe = min(b2, mb1)

      if os <= oe:

         candidate = oe - os +1

         if candidate > max_len:

            max_len = candidate

After processing all steps, output max_len.

But wait, what about steps where k=1? For k=1, L_prev is 0, since L(0) is 2^0 -1 =0. So the left part of step 1 is 0 characters, so the left part is [1,0], which is invalid. So for k=1, the left part is not present, and the middle is m=1, and the right part is also not present. So in step k=1, the only part is the middle m=1, which is 'a'.

But how does this code handle k=1? Let's see:

For k=1:

m = 1 << 0 =1.

L_prev =0.

So left part is 1..0 → invalid.

Right part is m+1=2 to (1 <<1) -1 =1 → which is invalid.

So for k=1, the left and right parts are invalid. Only the middle is present, which is position 1.

So the code for k=1 will check if position 1 is in both intervals. If yes, then max_len could be 1.

Other combinations (left1 and right2, etc.) will be skipped because the parts are invalid.

This is correct.

Now, let's test the code against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

3 6 1 4

overlap_len is max(3,1)=3, min(6,4)=4. So 4-3+1=2. So max_len is 2.

Processing steps from 30 downto 1.

For each step, check the middle and the left-right pairs.

At step 3:

k=3:

m=4.

Check if 4 is in both intervals.

First interval [3,6] includes 4. Second interval [1,4] includes 4. So max_len becomes max(2,1) = 2.

Then compute left and right parts.

For interval 1:

left1_start = max(3,1)=3. left1_end = min(6, 3) =3. So left1 is [3,3], valid.

right1_start = max(3,4+1=5) →5. right1_end = min(6,7) →6. So right1 is [5,6].

For interval 2:

left2_start = max(1,1) =1. left2_end = min(4,3) →3. So left2 is [1,3].

right2_start = max(1,5) →5. which is larger than right2_end = min(4,7) →4. So right2 is invalid.

So has_right2 is false.

Now, check left1 and right2: has_left1 is true, has_right2 is false → skip.

Check right1 and left2: has_right1 is true (5<=6), has_left2 is true (1<=3).

So:

a1=5, b1=6.

ma1 =5-4=1, mb1=6-4=2.

a2=1, b2=3.

os = max(1,1)=1.

oe = min(3, 2)=2.

candidate=2-1+1=2.

So candidate is 2. Current max_len is 2. So no change.

Thus, after step 3, the max_len is 2.

Other steps may contribute higher, but in this case, the max_len remains 2.

Thus, the code returns 2, which is correct.

Sample Input 2:

1 1 4 4.

overlap_len is 0.

Processing steps.

For each step, check if the middle is in both intervals.

For example, step 2's middle is 2. Check if 1<=2 <=1 → no. Step3's middle is4. Check if 1<=4 <=1 → no. For the second interval, 4 is included. So no overlapping middle.

For other steps, no overlapping.

Thus, the code returns 0.

Another test case: two intervals in mirrored parts.

For example, l1=1, r1=3 (left part of step 2), l2=5, r2=7 (right part of step 2).

The first interval is "aba" (step 2's left part), and the second is "aba" (step 2's right part). The overlapping mirrored ranges would be 1-3 and 1-3, so the candidate is 3. So the LCS is 3.

So the code would process step2:

For left1 and right2:

a1=1, b1=3.

a2=5, b2=7.

ma2=5-3=2 → 5-3=2 (since m=3 for step2).

mb2=7-3=4 → but the left part is up to L_prev=3-1=2. So mirrored_b2=4, but left part is up to 2.

So mirrored_a2=5-3=2 → but step2's left part is 1-2.

Wait, step k=2:

m = 2^(2-1) = 2.

L_prev = 2^(2-1) -1 =1.

So left part of step2 is 1-1 (since L_prev=1).

So for this example, step2's left part is 1-1, and right part is 3-3 (since step2's length is 3).

But the intervals are [1,3] and [5,7], which for step3.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the example.

Let me think of step3.

Step3's string is "abacaba" (length7).

Step3's left part is 1-3 ("aba"), middle is4 ('c'), right part is5-7 ("aba").

So for intervals [1-3] and [5-7], the code would process step3.

For step3:

m=4.

L_prev=3.

Left part is 1-3, right part is5-7.

So for interval1: left part is1-3.

For interval2: right part is5-7.

So a1=1, b1=3.

a2=5, b2=7.

ma2=5-4=1.

mb2=7-4=3.

The intersection between [1,3] (a1, b1) and [1,3] (ma2, mb2) is 3 characters. So candidate is3.

So the code would set max_len to3.

So the answer would be3.

Thus, the code would correctly handle mirrored parts.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

The code needs to read l1, r1, l2, r2 from input.

Compute the overlap_len.

Then process each step from30 downto1.

For each step:

compute m = 1 << (k-1)

L_prev = m -1

L_k = 2*m -1

Compute left and right parts for each interval.

Then check for left-right pairs.

Now, code:

Read l1, r1, l2, r2 = map(int, input().split())

Compute overlap_len.

max_len = max(0, min(r1, r2) - max(l1, l2) +1) if max(l1, l2) <= min(r1, r2) else 0

For k in 30 down to 1:

   m = 1 << (k-1)

   L_prev = m -1

   # Check middle

   if (l1 <= m <= r1) and (l2 <= m <= r2):

       if max_len < 1:

           max_len = 1

   # Compute left and right parts for each interval

   # interval1:

   left1_start = max(l1, 1)

   left1_end = min(r1, L_prev)

   has_left1 = left1_start <= left1_end

   right1_start = max(l1, m + 1)

   right1_end = min(r1, 2*m - 1)

   has_right1 = right1_start <= right1_end

   # interval2:

   left2_start = max(l2, 1)

   left2_end = min(r2, L_prev)

   has_left2 = left2_start <= left2_end

   right2_start = max(l2, m +1)

   right2_end = min(r2, 2*m -1)

   has_right2 = right2_start <= right2_end

   # check left1 and right2

   if has_left1 and has_right2:

       a1, b1 = left1_start, left1_end

       a2, b2 = right2_start, right2_end

       ma2 = a2 - m

       mb2 = b2 - m

       os = max(a1, ma2)

       oe = min(b1, mb2)

       if os <= oe:

           candidate = oe - os +1

           if candidate > max_len:

               max_len = candidate

   # check right1 and left2

   if has_right1 and has_left2:

       a1, b1 = right1_start, right1_end

       ma1 = a1 - m

       mb1 = b1 - m

       a2, b2 = left2_start, left2_end

       os = max(a2, ma1)

       oe = min(b2, mb1)

       if os <= oe:

           candidate = oe - os +1

           if candidate > max_len:

               max_len = candidate

print(max_len)

This code should handle all cases.

Testing against sample input 1.
