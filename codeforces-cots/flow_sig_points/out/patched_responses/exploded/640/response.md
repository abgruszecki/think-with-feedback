Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to sort an array of integers in non-descending order. The constraints are pretty small here. Let's look at the input constraints. The maximum n is 100, and each element is between 1 and 60. Hmm.

So, the first thing I think is, since the input size is very small (up to 100 elements), even the simplest sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort would work here. But wait, the problem is in Python. Python's built-in sort is very efficient, even for small lists. So the optimal approach here is probably just to read the elements, store them in a list, sort them, and then print them space-separated.

Wait, but the problem mentions that this is inspired by Befunge, but in Python, the solution is straightforward. Let me think about the steps.

The input starts with n, then n lines each containing a single integer. So the plan is:

1. Read n from input.
2. Read n integers from the following lines.
3. Sort the list.
4. Print the elements separated by spaces.

In Python, reading the input can be done with input() for each line. But for n lines, perhaps using a loop. But for n up to 100, this is not a problem.

So, for example, the first sample input is 5 elements: 7,1,9,7,3. After sorting, they become 1,3,7,7,9.

The second test case has a bunch of 1s and 60s, which after sorting are all the 1s first followed by 60s.

So the steps are straightforward.

Now, considering the constraints: time limit is 2 seconds and memory 64 MB. For n=100, even with the most naive approach, it's impossible to hit the time limit. So the optimal approach is to use the built-in sort function, which is O(n log n) time. That's definitely efficient enough here.

In terms of data structures, a list is sufficient. We just append all elements to a list, sort it, then output.

So the code structure would be:

Read n.

Then read n lines, each line is an integer. So something like:

n = int(input())
arr = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

Then sort the array:

arr.sort()

Then print the elements joined by spaces.

So the final output would be ' '.join(map(str, arr)).

Yes, that's all.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    arr = [int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n")) for _ in range(n)]
    arr.sort()
    print(' '.join(map(str, arr)), file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
10
60
1
60
1
60
1
60
1
60
1
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1 1 1 1 1 60 60 60 60 60
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Now, considering possible edge cases. For example, n=1: output is just the single element. For elements all the same, they stay in place. For elements in reverse order, sorted correctly.

So this approach should handle all cases.

In terms of memory, each element is an integer (stored as Python ints). Even for n=100, the memory used is negligible. So the code should fit within 64MB.

Thus, the Python code is straightforward and optimal. No need for any complicated data structures or algorithms here.
