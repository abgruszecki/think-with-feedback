<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully and understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the number of cells in a maze that are reachable from the starting position, given certain constraints on left and right moves. The key points here are:

- The maze is n rows by m columns.
- The starting cell is at (r, c), which is 1-based.
- We can move left at most x times and right at most y times. There's no restriction on up and down moves except for the maze boundaries and obstacles.
- Each cell must be reachable via some path that doesn't exceed the left/right move limits.

So the main challenge is to efficiently determine which cells are reachable considering the left and right move constraints, but allowing unlimited up and down as long as they are connected.

Hmm. Let's think about the constraints. The left and right moves are limited, but up and down are not. So the left/right movement is the limiting factor here. But how to model this.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that, for any cell (i, j), the number of left steps (relative to starting column) and right steps must be within x and y, respectively. Wait, not exactly. Because the path to that cell might involve moving left and right multiple times, but the total number of left moves (i.e., how many times we moved left in the entire path) can't exceed x, and same for right moves.

Wait, the problem says: "you can move left no more than x times and move right no more than y times." So each left movement in the path counts towards x, and each right movement counts towards y. So the total left steps in the path can't exceed x, and same for right. So even if you go left and then right and then left again, each left step adds to the count.

So, the problem is to find all cells reachable via a path where the number of left moves (steps to the left) is <=x and the number of right moves (steps to the right) is <=y.

This complicates things because we have to track the left and right counts for each cell. But with n and m up to 2000, and x and y up to 1e9, standard BFS approaches that track left and right counts for each cell would be impossible due to memory constraints. Because for each cell (i,j), the possible left and right counts could be up to 1e9, which is way too big.

So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to model this with the minimal left and right steps needed to reach a cell, and then see if those minimal steps are within x and y. But that's not straightforward. Because maybe a path uses more left steps but allows the right steps to be within y, but another path uses less left steps but more right steps. So for each cell, we need to track the minimal possible left and right steps used to reach it. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, for a given cell (i, j), let's think about how far left or right we can be from the starting column. Since the starting column is c, the column of the cell is j. The difference between j and the starting column's position (c) gives some information. For example, if j is to the left of c, then the minimum number of left steps required is (c - j). Similarly, if j is to the right, the minimum number of right steps is (j - c). But wait, how does that work?

Wait, when moving from (r, c) to a cell (i, j), the minimal left and right steps required would depend on how much the column j is shifted from c. Let's consider that:

Let's say the starting column is c. For a cell in column j, the minimal number of left steps needed is max(0, c - j), since to get from c to j (if j < c), you need to move left (c-j) times. Similarly, the minimal right steps needed is max(0, j - c).

But wait, those are the minimal steps required. Because in order to reach j from c, you have to have at least (c-j) left steps if j is left of c, or (j-c) right steps if j is right. But how do these numbers relate to the allowed x and y?

Because any path that reaches j must have left steps >= (c-j) if j < c, and right steps >= (j - c) if j > c. So for a cell j, the required left steps is (c - j) if j < c, and 0 otherwise. Similarly for right steps. So if x is less than (c - j) when j < c, then that cell is unreachable. Similarly for y and j >= c.

Wait, but the path could take a longer route. For example, maybe you can go left once, then right once, then left again, which would get you left overall but use two left steps and one right step. But that's more left steps than necessary. So for a cell j < c, the minimal left steps needed is (c-j). But any path to j must use at least (c-j) left steps, but could use more. So, if x is >= (c-j), then it's possible to reach j, provided that there exists a path where the total left steps used in the path is >= (c-j) and <=x, and the total right steps used is <=y.

Wait, but how do the left and right steps in the path relate to the column j? For example, moving left and then right would result in a net left of zero. So, j would be the same as the starting column. But to reach a j that's to the left of c, the path must have at least (c-j) left steps. But any additional left steps can be compensated by right steps, but that's only possible if the path allows such movement. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, think of it this way: the net number of left steps minus right steps determines the final column. Let's say the starting column is c. For each cell (i, j), the net left steps (left steps minus right steps) must equal (c - j). Because:

Each left step decreases the column by 1, each right increases by 1. So (left_steps - right_steps) = (c - j).

But wait, no. Wait, the starting column is c. Each left move subtracts 1, each right adds 1. So the total change in column is (right_steps - left_steps) = (current j - c). Because if you take l left steps and r right steps, the column is c + (r - l) = j. So (r - l) = j - c. So the left_steps + right_steps is the total number of horizontal moves. But the problem constraints are that left_steps <= x and right_steps <= y.

So, for a cell (i,j) to be reachable:

- The cell must be reachable through any path (i.e., there's a path from starting cell to (i,j) considering obstacles and boundaries).
- The number of left steps (l) and right steps (r) in that path must satisfy l <=x and r <= y.
- Additionally, since r - l = j - c (from the column difference), we can express r = l + (j - c). But since r can't be negative, j must be >= c - l (but this is getting complicated).

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a cell (i,j), the necessary conditions to be reachable are:

1. The cell is accessible via the maze (no obstacles, and reachable via up/down moves as needed).
2. The minimal required left steps and right steps for that cell (based on j's position) must be <= x and y.

But how to compute that?

Let's think: for any cell (i,j), the minimal number of left steps required is l_min = max(0, (c - j)), since that's the minimum left steps needed if j is to the left of c. Similarly, the minimal right steps required is r_min = max(0, (j - c)).

But the path could have more left and right steps. For example, to reach j, you can take l_min + a left steps and r_min + a right steps, as long as a is non-negative and (l_min +a) <=x and (r_min +a) <=y. Because the net movement would be ( (r_min +a) - (l_min +a) ) = r_min - l_min = (j - c) - 0 (if j >=c) or (j - c) is negative, but wait. Let's think again.

Wait, for cell (i,j), the column is j. The starting column is c. So the total right steps minus left steps must equal j - c. So:

r - l = j - c

But r <= y and l <= x.

So, substituting r = j - c + l.

We get:

l <=x

j - c + l <= y

But l must be >=0, and j - c + l >=0 (since r >=0).

But solving these inequalities for l:

We need l >= max(0, (c - j)) (since j - c + l >=0 => l >= c - j if j < c. For example, if j < c, then j - c is negative. So l >= (c - j) makes j - c + l >=0. So l >= (c - j). But in this case, j < c, so (c - j) is positive. So l must be >= (c - j).

So for j < c: l >= (c - j), and l <=x, and j - c + l <=y.

But substituting l >= (c-j) into j - c + l >=0: yes, since l >= (c-j) implies j -c + l >=0.

So, combining:

For j < c:

l >= (c-j)

l <=x

j -c + l <= y => l <= (y + c - j)

So the possible l's must satisfy:

(c-j) <= l <= min(x, y + c -j)

But in this case, for j < c, the minimal possible l is (c-j). And for that l, the required r is (j -c + l) = (j -c) + (c-j) = 0. So the minimal right steps is zero. But the problem allows right steps up to y. So if l is (c-j), then r is zero, which is allowed as long as (c-j) <=x (since l is (c-j) <=x), and 0 <=y (which it is). So if (c-j) <=x, then the cell j can be reached with l=(c-j) steps. But the cell j may not be reachable due to obstacles.

But how does the path affect this? Because even if the cell j is to the left of c and the required left steps (c-j) is <=x and right steps 0 <=y, but there's no path (due to obstacles) that allows moving left (c-j) times and then up/down as needed.

Wait, this approach seems to separate the horizontal constraints (left and right steps) from the vertical movement (up and down). But the problem is that the path may require moving left and right multiple times. For example, to go from c to j which is left of c by 2 steps, the minimal path is two left steps. But if there's an obstacle blocking the direct path, you might have to move up, then left twice, then down. But that would still use two left steps.

But even if you have to take some detour, the left and right steps required are still the same. So the minimal left steps required is (c-j) when j is left of c. Any detour would add more left or right steps, but the problem allows that as long as the total left steps are <=x and right steps <=y.

Wait, but for example, suppose j is left of c by 2 steps, but the path requires moving left once, then up, then left again. So total left steps is 2 (which is minimal). But if x is 1, then this is impossible. So in that case, the cell j is unreachable. So the conclusion is: for a cell j left of c by d steps, the minimal required left steps is d. If d >x, then the cell is unreachable. If d <=x, then as long as there exists a path to (i,j) where the sum of left steps is >=d (but <=x), and sum of right steps is <=y, then the cell is reachable.

But how can the sum of right steps be anything, as long as it's <=y? Because right steps can be added in the path, but the net steps (r - l) must equal (j -c). So for j left of c by d steps, we have r - l = -d. Since j is to the left, j = c -d. So r = l -d. But since r >=0, l must be >=d. So in this scenario, l can be any value >=d and <=x. Then r would be l -d. But since r must be <=y, this implies l -d <=y. So l <= y +d. But l must also be <=x. So the maximum l allowed is min(x, y +d). So the minimal l is d. So the possible l ranges from d to min(x, y +d). If this interval is non-empty (i.e., d <= min(x, y +d)), then it's possible. But since d is positive (as j is left of c), y +d could be larger than x. So the condition is d <=x and (d -d) <=y. Wait, no. Let's see:

If j is left of c by d steps, then the necessary conditions are:

l >=d (since r = l -d >=0)

l <=x

r = l -d <= y → l <= y +d

So combining these:

d <= l <= min(x, y +d)

If this interval is valid (i.e., d <= min(x, y +d)), then there exists possible l and r that satisfy the constraints.

So the problem reduces to:

For each cell (i,j) that is reachable via any path (i.e., ignoring left/right step constraints but considering obstacles and movement up/down), check if the required l and r can be found within the x and y limits.

Wait, but how to model this for all cells?

The steps would be:

1. Find all cells reachable from (r, c) via any path (BFS, considering obstacles, but without considering left/right steps limits). But for each cell, track the minimum possible left and right steps required. Or, track the possible ranges of left and right steps.

But how? Because the path can vary, leading to different l and r values. However, for a cell (i,j), the required net horizontal steps is (r - l) = (j - c). So r = l + (j - c). So for each cell (i,j), the possible l is such that:

l >= max(0, (c - j)) → since j can be to the left (c-j is positive) or to the right.

Wait, when j is to the right of c (j >c), then (j -c) is positive. So r = l + (j -c). But l must be >=0, and r <=y. So l can be 0,1, ..., up to (y - (j -c)), as long as that's >=0. Also, since l <=x.

So for j >=c:

r = l + (j -c) → must be <= y → l <= y - (j -c)

But l >=0, and (j -c) >=0 (since j >=c). So l can range from 0 to min(x, y - (j -c)).

But for this range to be valid, y - (j -c) must be >=0 → (j -c) <=y → j <= c +y.

So for j >=c, the possible l is 0 <= l <= min(x, y - (j -c)), and (j -c) must be <=y.

So for a cell (i,j) to be reachable:

- It must be reachable in the maze (obstacles and path exists via up/down)
- The column j must satisfy the constraints based on x and y.

So the approach could be:

- Find all cells (i,j) reachable via BFS (ignoring left/right steps constraints)
- For each such cell, check if j is within [c -x, c + y]. Because:

If j is to the left of c by more than x steps (j < c -x), then even the minimal required left steps (d = c -j) would be >x, so impossible.

If j is to the right of c by more than y steps (j > c + y), then the minimal required right steps (j -c) would be >y, so impossible.

So for j to be reachable, it must be in [c -x, c + y]. But also, the cell must be reachable via some path.

Wait, but this is only part of the story. Because even if j is within [c -x, c + y], the path may require more steps than allowed. For example, j is c + y - 1, but the path requires moving right y times and left once, which would require r = y and l=1. So l must be <=x. So x has to be at least 1.

Hmm. So the previous idea that j must be in [c -x, c +y] is necessary but not sufficient. Because even if j is within that range, the required l and r may not fit into x and y.

Wait, let's take j = c + y. Then j -c = y. So for any l, r = l + y. But r must be <=y → l + y <=y → l <=0. But l >=0. So l must be 0. Then r = y. So to reach j = c + y, l must be 0 and r must be y. So x must be >=0 (which it is), and y must be >=y (which it is). So possible. So j can be c +y, but only if there's a path where all the right steps are taken and no left steps. But that's possible only if the path moves right exactly y times. So if there's a path that allows moving right y times (without left steps), then j can be c +y.

But how do these constraints translate into a way to model the problem?

Another approach: For any cell (i,j) that is reachable (ignoring left/right constraints), check whether there exists l and r such that:

l <=x

r <=y

r - l = j - c

l >= max(0, (c -j))

r >= max(0, (j -c))

But since r = l + (j -c), substituting:

l <=x

l + (j -c) <=y → l <= y - (j -c) 

But for j >=c: j -c >=0. So l <= y - (j -c). Also l >=0.

So for j >=c:

0 <= l <= min(x, y - (j -c))

But (j -c) must be <=y → j <=c +y.

For j <c:

l >= (c -j)

l <=x

l <= y + (c -j) → because (j -c) is negative, so (j -c) = -(d), d =c -j.

So r = l -d → r must be >=0 → l >=d.

Also, r = l -d <=y → l <=y +d → l <=y + (c -j)

So combining:

For j <c:

l must be between (c -j) and min(x, y + (c -j)).

But (c-j) must be <=x (since l >=c-j and l <=x → x >=c-j).

So, the problem can be broken down as:

For a cell (i,j) to be reachable:

1. The cell is part of the connected component reachable from (r,c) via BFS (ignoring left/right constraints, but considering obstacles and movement up/down).
2. The column j satisfies:

   a. If j <=c:

      (c -j) <=x (i.e., the minimal required left steps is <=x)

      and (j -c) + l = (j -c) + (l) → wait, no. Wait, the equation is r = l + (j -c). But for j <c, j -c is negative. So r = l + (j -c) → l = r + (c -j). So r must be >=0, so l >= c-j.

      So for j <c:

      The minimal l is (c-j). For this l, r=0. So as long as (c-j) <=x, then l is allowed. Because r=0 <=y (since y is >=0). So j can be as far left as c -x. Because if j = c -x, then (c-j) =x, so l=x is allowed. But if j is c -x -1, then (c-j) =x+1, which is larger than x, so no.

      So j must be >= c -x.

   b. If j >=c:

      (j -c) <=y (i.e., minimal right steps is (j -c) <=y).

      So j can be up to c +y.

So combining both cases, j must be in [c -x, c +y].

So for a cell (i,j) to be reachable, it must satisfy:

j is between c -x and c +y, inclusive.

Additionally, (i,j) must be reachable via BFS considering up/down and obstacles.

If both conditions are met, then the cell is counted.

Wait, does this cover all possible cases?

Let's see. Suppose x=1, y=2. Starting column c=5.

Consider j=4 (left by 1). So c-j=1. So l must be >=1. Since x=1, l can be exactly 1. Then r =1 -1=0. So allowed. So j=4 is allowed.

What about j=3 (c-j=2). Then, x=1 <2. So j=3 is not allowed.

Now consider j=6 (right by 1). Then, j-c=1 <= y=2. So allowed.

Another case: x=3, y=2. j= c-3 (so c-j=3 <=x=3). So allowed. But j is allowed. But j could be further right. For example, j =c +2 (y=2). So allowed.

But what about a scenario where j is in [c-x, c+y], but the required l and r can't be satisfied.

Wait, suppose x=1, y=1. j is c-1 (left by 1). So j is allowed. l must be >=1, and r=0. So l=1 (<=x=1), r=0 (<=y=1). So allowed.

Now, x=1, y=0. j is c-1. Then, l=1 (<=x=1), r=0 (<=y=0). So allowed.

But if j is c-2, then c-j=2, but x=1 <2. So not allowed.

Another example: x=0, y=1. j must be >=c (since x=0, cannot move left). So j can be from c to c+1. For j=c+1: j-c=1 <=y=1. So allowed.

But suppose j=c. Then j-c=0. So l can be 0 (allowed since x=0). So allowed.

But wait, the key point here is that the cell j must be in [c-x, c+y], and also the cell must be reachable via BFS. So the steps to solve the problem would be:

1. Perform BFS (or another traversal) to find all reachable cells, considering only up/down/left/right but ignoring the left/right step constraints (but not the obstacles and maze boundaries).

2. For each reachable cell (i,j), check if j is within [c -x, c +y]. If yes, count it.

But wait, this seems to ignore some constraints. Because j could be within [c-x, c+y], but the path to reach it requires more left or right steps than allowed.

Wait, for example: x=1, y=1. Starting column c=3. j=4 (right of c by 1). So minimal right steps is 1. So allowed. But what if the path to j=4 requires moving right once (y=1 is okay). So counted.

But another scenario: x=1, y=1. j=3 (same column as c). So minimal left and right steps are zero. So any path that reaches j=3 (same column) would have l and r steps such that l <=x and r <=y. Because the minimal is zero. So as long as j is in [c-x, c+y], which in this case is [2,4], then j=3 is allowed. So it's counted.

Wait, but what if the path to j=3 (same column) requires taking left and right steps, but their total is within x and y.

For example: path goes left once (l=1) then right once (r=1). Then net is zero. So l=1 (<=x=1), r=1 (<=y=1). So allowed.

But the cell j=3 is in [2,4], so it's counted.

But according to the approach above, as long as j is in [c-x, c+y], which is 3-1=2, 3+1=4. So j=3 is included.

Thus, the approach of checking j's column is within [c-x, c+y] and the cell is reachable via BFS (ignoring left/right steps) is sufficient.

But why is that?

Because any cell (i,j) in the BFS reachable set and j is in [c-x, c+y] can be reached via a path where the left steps are <=x and right steps <=y. Because:

If j is in [c-x, c+y], then:

- For j <=c: j >=c -x → c -j <=x. So the minimal left steps required is c-j <=x. So there exists a path where the left steps are exactly (c-j) and right steps are zero (possible, if the path can be done by moving left (c-j) times, then up/down as needed). So the left steps (c-j) <=x and right steps (0) <=y.

- For j >=c: j <=c +y → j -c <=y. So the minimal right steps is (j-c) <=y, and left steps zero. So a path that moves right (j-c) times and up/down as needed would use left steps 0 (<=x) and right steps (j-c) <=y.

Thus, even if there's a path that requires more left and right steps, but j is in the allowed range, there must be a path that uses the minimal left/right steps, which are within x and y. Because the minimal steps are allowed.

But wait, how do we know that such a path exists? Because the BFS considers all possible paths (including those that might have extra left and right steps). But in the BFS, we are considering all cells that are reachable via any path, regardless of left/right steps. So even if the path has left steps exceeding x or right steps exceeding y, but the cell j is in [c-x, c+y], then there must be a path that uses minimal steps (left steps c-j if j <c, or right steps j-c if j> c), which is within x and y.

But how can we be sure that such a minimal path exists?

Ah, because the BFS already includes all cells reachable via any path. So if a cell is in the BFS, then there exists a path to it. But for the minimal left/right steps, can we always find a path that uses exactly those steps?

Yes. Because the minimal steps are the required ones. For example, if j is to the left of c by 2, then you can move left twice (if the path is possible) and then up/down. But if there are obstacles in the direct path, you might need to detour. But the detour would require moving up, then left, then down, etc. But those would still be two left steps, with zero right steps. So the left steps would be exactly 2, which is <=x if x >=2.

So the key insight here is that if j is within [c-x, c+y], then the minimal left/right steps required are within x and y. So there must exist a path that uses those minimal steps, which would be allowed. Therefore, the cell is counted.

Therefore, the solution is:

- Find all cells reachable via BFS (without considering left/right step constraints).
- For each reachable cell (i,j), check if j is between (c -x) and (c +y). If yes, count it.

This approach is O(nm) time and space, which is acceptable for n and m up to 2000.

So the steps to implement this:

1. Read the maze.

2. Convert r and c to 0-based indices (since Python uses 0-based lists).

3. Perform a BFS starting from (r, c), keeping track of visited cells (considering obstacles and maze boundaries).

4. For each visited cell (i,j), check if j (the column) is within [c_original -x, c_original +y]. Note that in the problem statement, the columns are 1-based. Wait, no: in the input, the starting cell is given as (r, c), which are 1-based. So for example, if the input says r=3, c=2, that would be row index 2 (0-based) and column index 1 (0-based). Wait, no. Let's see: the problem says "the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the cell at row i and column j".

Wait, the problem's input uses 1-based indices for rows and columns. So the first line of the maze (third line of input) corresponds to row 1, the next to row 2, etc. Similarly, each line's j-th character is column j.

So when we read the input, we need to adjust the starting cell's row and column to 0-based.

So for example, if the starting cell is given as (r=3, c=2), then in 0-based terms, it's (2, 1).

So during the code, we need to subtract 1 from r and c to get the 0-based indices.

Once we have the BFS visited matrix, for each cell (i,j) in the visited cells, check if the original (1-based) column (j+1) is between c_original -x and c_original +y. Wait, no. Because j in the code is 0-based. So the original column is j+1. So c_original is the input c (1-based). So for example, the original column is c_original = input c. The current column (j in code) is j+1 in 1-based terms.

So to check if j+1 is within [c_original -x, c_original +y].

Alternatively, in code:

original_c = c (from input, 1-based)

current_j_1based = j +1

so current_j_1based must satisfy:

current_j_1based >= (original_c -x) 

current_j_1based <= (original_c + y)

So, for each cell (i,j) in the BFS visited set:

if (j+1) >= (original_c -x) and (j+1) <= (original_c + y):

   count +=1

But since original_c is the input c (1-based), original_c -x can be as low as 1 -x. But the columns are 1-based. So for example, if x is larger than original_c -1, then the left bound would be 0 or negative. But since the columns start at 1, any j+1 >=1. So the effective left bound is max(1, original_c -x).

But in code, when checking (j+1 >= (original_c -x)), since j+1 can't be less than 1, the actual check is whether j+1 is in the allowed range.

But perhaps the code can be written as:

original_c = input_c

left_bound = original_c -x

right_bound = original_c + y

if j+1 >= left_bound and j+1 <= right_bound:

   count +=1

But in code, original_c and x/y can be very large (since x and y can be up to 1e9). But since j is 0-based up to m-1 (columns are 1-based, so j can be up to m-1 → j+1 up to m), so the actual j+1 can't exceed m. So even if original_c -x is negative, j+1 can't be less than 1, so the code will check if j+1 is >= left_bound (which may be negative) and <= right_bound (which may be larger than m). But the j+1 is between 1 and m. So the code can proceed as written.

Thus, the algorithm is:

- BFS to find all reachable cells (i,j) in the maze.

- For each such cell, check if (j+1) is between (original_c -x) and (original_c + y).

- Sum all such cells.

Now, the BFS step. For n and m up to 2000, a standard BFS using a queue and a visited matrix is feasible. The visited matrix can be a 2D array of booleans of size n x m. Each cell is processed once. So the BFS is O(nm) time, which is acceptable for 2000x2000 = 4e6 cells.

Now, code steps:

Read n, m.

Read r, c (convert to 0-based: r -=1, c -=1).

Read x, y.

Read n lines of the maze. Each line is a string. So maze = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].

But wait, the starting cell is guaranteed to be '.'.

Now, perform BFS:

Initialize a 2D array visited[n][m], all False.

Create a queue. Start with (r, c), mark visited[r][c] = True.

For each cell in the queue, explore four directions. For each direction (up, down, left, right), check if the new cell is within the maze, not visited, and is '.'.

If so, add to queue and mark as visited.

Once BFS is complete, iterate through all visited cells, and count those where j+1 (original column) is in [original_c_input -x, original_c_input +y].

Original_c_input is the input c (before converting to 0-based). For example, if input c was 3, then original_c_input is 3. So in code, the original_c = input_c (from second line of input). So after converting to 0-based for processing, but need to use the original 1-based c for the column check.

Wait, let's clarify:

Suppose input line 2 is r=3, c=2 (1-based). So code reads:

r, c = map(int, input().split())

Then, code converts to 0-based:

r -=1

c -=1 → so c becomes 1 (since 2-1=1). 

But original_c_input is 2. Because the input c was 2 (1-based). So when checking the column, we need to check j+1 (1-based column) against original_c_input -x and original_c_input +y.

Yes.

So the code steps:

Read n, m.

r, c = map(int, input().split())

original_r = r 

original_c = c 

r -=1 

c -=1 

x, y = map(int, input().split())

maze = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Then perform BFS starting from (r,c), considering obstacles.

Once BFS is done, count all (i,j) where visited[i][j] is True and (j+1) >= (original_c -x) and (j+1) <= (original_c + y).

So the code will be:

Implement BFS.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:

4 5

3 2 → original_r=3, original_c=2 → 0-based r=2, c=1.

1 2 → x=1, y=2.

.....
.***.
...**
*....

original_c = 2. So allowed columns are 2-1=1 to 2+2=4.

So j+1 must be between 1 and4.

The BFS will find all reachable cells. For each of them, check if their 1-based column is 1-4. The count is 10.

Which matches the sample.

Second example:

4 4

2 2 → original_c=2 → 0-based c=1.

0 1 → x=0, y=1. So allowed columns: 2-0=2 to 2+1=3. So j+1 must be in 2-3.

The maze is:

....

..*.

....

....

So starting cell is (1,1) in 0-based. BFS will find cells, but only those in columns 2-3 (1-based). The count is 7.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach works for the samples.

Now, code implementation.

But considering the constraints, we need to optimize for speed and memory.

In Python, BFS using a deque is efficient. For the visited matrix, a 2D list of booleans.

But for 2000x2000, a list of lists is manageable. Each row is 2000 booleans, and 2000 rows. So 2000*2000 = 4e6 entries. Each boolean is 1 byte (but in Python, it's actually stored as bits in optimized way, but even as 1 byte each, 4MB is manageable within the 512MB limit.

So code steps:

Read n, m.

Read r, c → convert to 0-based.

Read x, y.

Read maze.

Check if the starting cell is '.' (as per problem statement, it's guaranteed, but perhaps code can skip this).

Implement BFS:

Initialize visited as a 2D list of False.

Use a deque for the queue.

Mark the starting cell as visited and enqueue.

Then for each cell in the queue, check four directions.

After BFS, iterate over all cells (i,j), check if visited[i][j] and (j+1) is between original_c -x and original_c +y.

Count the total.

Now, code.

But note that in Python, for 2000x2000 grid, the BFS can be slow if not optimized. So using deque is important. Also, avoiding creating unnecessary structures.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().split())
    r, c = map(int, input_stream.readline().split())
    original_c = c
    r -=1
    c -=1
    x, y = map(int, input_stream.readline().split())

    maze = []
    for _ in range(n):
        row = input_stream.readline().strip()
        maze.append(row)

    visited = [[False for _ in range(m)] for __ in range(n)]

    q = deque()
    if maze[r][c] == '.':
        visited[r][c] = True
        q.append((r, c))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    while q:
        i, j = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            ni = i + dx
            nj = j + dy
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and not visited[ni][nj] and maze[ni][nj] == '.':
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                q.append((ni, nj))

    count =0
    left_bound = original_c -x
    right_bound = original_c + y

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if visited[i][j]:
                col = j +1
                if left_bound <= col <= right_bound:
                    count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)

        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')

    test()


```

```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample input 2:

4 4

2 2 → original_c=2.

x=0, y=1.

allowed columns: 2-0=2 to 2+1=3. So columns 2 and 3 (1-based).

The BFS will find cells in columns 2 and 3.

But in the code, for each cell (i,j), j+1 must be in 2-0=2 and 2+1=3.

So yes.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Edge cases to consider:

Test case where x=0, y=0. So can't move left or right. So allowed columns is original_c (since 2-0=2 and 2+0=2). So only cells in column 2 (1-based) that are reachable via up/down.

Another case: original_c=1, x=0. So left_bound=1-0=1. So any cell in column 1 (1-based) can be counted if reachable.

Another case: maze is completely blocked except starting cell. So count is 1 if j+1 is in allowed range.

Another case: original_c is 1, x=0. So left_bound=1, j+1 >=1. So j must be 0 (0-based) which is column 1. So allowed.

Thus, the code handles all these cases.

The code should be correct.
