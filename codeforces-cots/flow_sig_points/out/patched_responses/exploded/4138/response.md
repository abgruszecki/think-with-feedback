<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about sorting strings in lexicographical order by possibly reversing some of them. The goal is to find the minimum energy cost required to do that. Each reversal of the i-th string costs ci energy. So, the main challenge is to decide for each string whether to reverse it or not, ensuring that each consecutive pair is ordered correctly, and find the minimal total cost.

First, I need to understand the constraints. The number of strings n can be up to 10^5, and the total length of all strings is up to 10^5. So, any algorithm that is O(n) or O(n log n) should be acceptable. But if we have O(n^2) steps, that's way too slow. So, the approach must be linear or linearithmic.

Let's think about dynamic programming. For each string, there are two possibilities: it's in its original form or reversed. For each position i, we can track the minimal cost required to have the first i strings ordered correctly, given that the i-th string is either not reversed or reversed. Then, for each step, we check both possibilities for the current string and see which transitions are valid from the previous state.

Yes, that makes sense. So, for each i, we can track two states: reversed or not. Let's call dp[i][0] the minimal cost up to the i-th string when it is not reversed, and dp[i][1] when it is reversed. The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0 (if we don't reverse the first string, cost 0) or dp[0][1] = c0 (if we reverse the first string, cost c0).

Wait, but the first string can be either reversed or not. So the initial state is:

For the first string, dp[0][0] = 0 (cost if not reversed), dp[0][1] = c[0] (cost if reversed). Then, for each subsequent string i (starting from 1), we need to check all possible transitions from i-1's state (either reversed or not) to i's state (reversed or not). For each possible transition, we check if the (i-1)th string's chosen form (original or reversed) is <= the i-th string's chosen form. If it is, then we can take the minimal cost so far plus the cost of reversing or not the current string.

So the recurrence would be something like:

For each i from 1 to n-1:

dp[i][0] = min(
   if previous string's 0 state is valid (s_prev_0 <= s_current_0) then dp[i-1][0] + 0,
   if previous string's 1 state is valid (s_prev_1 <= s_current_0) then dp[i-1][1] + 0
) 

Similarly for dp[i][1], but adding the cost c[i] (since reversing the current string incurs cost c[i]).

But wait, the current string's cost is part of the decision. So for the current i-th string, if we choose to reverse it, we add c[i] to the total cost. So the transitions are:

For the current i-th string:

Check all possible previous states (i-1, 0 and 1) and current states (0 and 1). For each possible combination, see if the previous string's chosen form is <= current's form. If yes, then the current dp can be updated with the minimal possible value.

So for each i, we have two options (current reversed or not), and each option can transition from two possible previous options (if possible).

So the steps are:

1. Precompute for each string its original and reversed version.

2. For each string i, store the original s and reversed s_rev.

3. For each i from 1 to n-1:

   a. For current state 0 (not reversed), check the previous state 0 and 1. For each possible previous state, if the previous string's chosen form is <= current's original, then take the previous DP value and add 0 (since current is not reversed, cost is 0). The minimal among these options becomes dp[i][0].

   b. For current state 1 (reversed), check the previous state 0 and 1. For each possible previous state, if previous's form is <= current's reversed, then take previous DP value plus current c[i] cost. The minimal of these options becomes dp[i][1].

4. After processing all strings, the answer is the minimum of dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-1][1], provided that either is valid. If both are infinity (meaning no valid path), output -1.

But how to handle the initial state? For the first string (i=0), the two options are possible: reversed or not, with their respective costs. Then, for each next string, we check transitions.

Now, the key is to represent the reversed and original strings for each position and efficiently compare them with the previous step's options.

But comparing two strings can take O(L) time where L is the length of the strings. So for each step, comparing the previous state's string (original or reversed) with the current state's string (original or reversed) could take O(L) time per comparison. Since the total sum of all L's is up to 1e5, and n is up to 1e5, this approach would have O(n * L) time, which is acceptable as 1e5 * 1e5 is 1e10, but that's way too big. Wait, but the total sum of all L's is 1e5, so each step's comparison is O(L_i) where L_i is the current string's length plus the previous. Wait, but in the worst case, if each string is of length 1e5, but n is 1, then it's okay. But if n is 1e5 and each string is 1 character, then total comparisons are 1e5 * 2 * 2 (each step has 2 previous options and 2 current options) = 4e5 steps, each O(1) time. So the total time should be manageable. Let's see:

Each step for i from 1 to n-1:

We need to compare the previous strings (original or reversed) with the current strings (original or reversed). So for each i, there are 2 possibilities for the previous (i-1) state (0 or 1) and 2 possibilities for the current state (0 or 1). So for each i, we have 4 possible transitions. Each transition requires comparing two strings (the previous's chosen state vs current's chosen state). Each such comparison is O(min(L_prev, L_current)) time, but in the worst case, for the first few steps, if strings are long, but with the sum of all lengths being 1e5, the total time across all steps would be O(1e5), which is acceptable.

Wait, because each string's characters are stored, and when we compare two strings (like a and b), the lexicographical comparison is done in O(min(len(a), len(b))) time, because once a character differs, we can stop. But the worst case is when the strings are the same except for the last character. But the sum of all such comparisons across all steps would be O(total sum of lengths). Let me see:

Suppose each string is compared once with the next. For each i, when comparing the (i-1)th string's reversed/original with the ith's reversed/original, each such pair may take up to O(L_i) time. But across all i, the sum of L_i would be 1e5, and each transition would compare two strings (for each possible pair of previous and current state). For each i, there are 2*2=4 possible transitions. Each transition requires a string comparison. So the total sum of comparisons would be O(4 * sum of L_i) = 4e5, which is manageable.

So the approach is feasible.

Now, the steps:

First, precompute all reversed strings. For each string, store s and reversed_s.

Then, for each string i, we need to track the possible options (reverse or not) and their costs.

The DP will track the minimal cost for each state (reverse or not) up to that string.

Initialize the DP array with infinity for all states except the first string.

For the first string, the cost is 0 if not reversed, and c[0] if reversed.

Then, for each subsequent string i (starting from 1 to n-1):

For each possible previous state (prev_rev: 0 or 1):

   For each possible current state (curr_rev: 0 or 1):

      If the previous string's state (prev_rev) is <= current string's state (curr_rev):

          Compute the cost: dp_prev_prev_rev + (curr_rev ? c[i] : 0)

          If this cost is less than the current dp[i][curr_rev], update it.

Wait, but the transitions are from i-1's states to i's states. So for each current state (0 or 1), we need to consider all possible previous states (0 and 1) that are valid (i.e., their string is <= current string's state's string).

So, for each i, for current state 0 (not reversed):

   check if previous state 0's string (s_prev) <= current state 0's string (s_current). If yes, then dp[i][0] can be updated with dp[i-1][0] + 0 (since current state is not reversed, cost 0).

   check if previous state 1's string (s_prev_rev) <= current state 0's string (s_current). If yes, then dp[i][0] can be updated with dp[i-1][1] + 0.

Similarly, for current state 1 (reversed):

   check if previous state 0's string (s_prev) <= current state 1's string (s_current_rev). If yes, then cost is dp[i-1][0] + c[i].

   check if previous state 1's string (s_prev_rev) <= current state 1's string (s_current_rev). If yes, then cost is dp[i-1][1] + c[i].

So for each i, for each current state (0 and 1), we need to check two possible transitions from previous states (0 and 1). Each check involves comparing two strings (the previous state's string vs current state's string).

We need to compute these comparisons for each possible transition.

So the algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Precompute reversed strings for all i.

2. Initialize the DP. For i=0:

   dp[0][0] = 0 (cost if not reversed)

   dp[0][1] = c[0] (cost if reversed)

3. For each i from 1 to n-1:

   a. Initialize dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] to infinity.

   b. Get the previous (i-1) strings' original and reversed versions.

   c. For current state 0 (current string not reversed):

      i. Compare the previous state 0's string (i-1's original) with current's original.

         If s_prev_0 <= s_current_0:

             if dp[i-1][0] < current dp[i][0], then update.

      ii. Compare the previous state 1's string (i-1's reversed) with current's original.

          If s_prev_1 <= s_current_0:

              if dp[i-1][1] < current dp[i][0], then update.

   d. For current state 1 (current string reversed):

      i. Compare previous state 0's original with current's reversed.

          If s_prev_0 <= s_current_rev:

              possible cost is dp[i-1][0] + c[i]

              if this cost is less than current dp[i][1], update.

      ii. Compare previous state 1's reversed with current's reversed.

          If s_prev_1 <= s_current_rev:

              possible cost is dp[i-1][1] + c[i]

              if this cost is less than current dp[i][1], update.

4. After processing all strings, the answer is the minimum of dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-1][1]. If both are infinity, return -1.

Now, the crucial part is implementing the string comparisons correctly.

But how to compare two strings lexicographically as per the problem statement?

The problem says:

"A is lex smaller than B if:

- A is shorter and a prefix of B, or

- At the first differing character, A has a smaller character."

So the standard lex order for Python is correct here. Because in Python, 'a' < 'b', 'ab' < 'abc' (since 'ab' is shorter and a prefix). So using the standard Python string comparison (s1 <= s2) should work.

So the code can directly compare the strings using the <= operator.

Now, handling the DP. Since n can be up to 1e5, using a 2-element array for each i is manageable in terms of memory. For each i, we only need to keep track of the previous state's dp values, not all of them. Because to compute dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], we only need dp[i-1][0] and dp[i-1][1]. So we can optimize space by only keeping the previous state's values.

Yes! That's a key optimization. Since for each step, we only need the previous i-1's state, we can use two variables to track the previous dp0 and dp1, and compute the current dp0 and dp1 based on those. This reduces the memory from O(n) to O(1), which is better.

So the steps can be modified to use only previous_dp0 and previous_dp1.

Initialize:

previous_dp0 = 0 (cost for first string not reversed)

previous_dp1 = c[0] (cost for first string reversed)

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

current_dp0 = infinity

current_dp1 = infinity

Check transitions from previous_dp0 and previous_dp1 to current_dp0 and current_dp1.

For each possible transition:

if the previous string's chosen version (original or reversed) is <= current's original:

   current_dp0 can be updated with min(current_dp0, previous_dp0 or previous_dp1)

Similarly for current_dp1.

This way, we only need to keep track of two variables (previous_dp0 and previous_dp1) for each step, leading to O(1) space.

So the code can be structured as follows:

Read n.

Read c as a list of integers.

Read the n strings, store them in a list.

Precompute reversed versions for each string.

Then, initialize previous_dp0 and previous_dp1.

For each i from 1 to n-1:

   current string's original is s[i], reversed is s_rev[i].

   previous string's original is s[i-1], reversed is s_rev[i-1].

   For current_dp0:

      possible1 = previous_dp0 if s[i-1] <= s[i] else infinity

      possible2 = previous_dp1 if s_rev[i-1] <= s[i] else infinity

      current_dp0 = min(possible1, possible2)

   For current_dp1:

      possible1 = previous_dp0 + c[i] if s[i-1] <= s_rev[i] else infinity

      possible2 = previous_dp1 + c[i] if s_rev[i-1] <= s_rev[i] else infinity

      current_dp1 = min(possible1, possible2)

   Then, set previous_dp0 and previous_dp1 to current_dp0 and current_dp1.

   If both are infinity, then break early and return -1.

Wait, but in each step, after computing current_dp0 and current_dp1, if both are infinity, then there's no possible way to proceed, so the answer is -1.

So during the iteration, after processing each i, if both current_dp0 and current_dp1 are infinity, we can immediately return -1.

But in code, for each i starting from 1 to n-1, we compute the current_dp0 and current_dp1, then check if both are infinity. If yes, return -1.

Now, what about the initial step? For the first string, previous_dp0 and previous_dp1 are set. If the first string's original and reversed are the same, then the cost could be the minimum of 0 and c[0]. But that's handled in the initial step.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

Read the list of c as integers.

Read the n strings.

Precompute reversed versions for each string. For example, reversed_str[i] = s[i][::-1].

Then, for each i from 0 to n-1:

   reversed_str[i] = s[i][::-1]

Now, for the initial step (i=0):

previous_dp0 = 0 (not reversed)

previous_dp1 = c[0] (reversed)

Then, for i in 1 to n-1:

   current string is s[i], reversed_str[i]

   previous string is s[i-1], reversed_str[i-1]

   Compute possible transitions.

   current_dp0 is the minimum of:

      if previous_dp0 is not infinity and s_prev_0 (s[i-1]) <= s_current_0 (s[i]):

          previous_dp0

      if previous_dp1 is not infinity and s_prev_1 (reversed_str[i-1]) <= s_current_0 (s[i]):

          previous_dp1

   current_dp0 is the min of these possibilities, or infinity if both are invalid.

   Similarly for current_dp1, which is the min of:

      if previous_dp0 is not infinity and s_prev_0 <= s_current_1 (reversed_str[i]):

          previous_dp0 + c[i]

      if previous_dp1 is not infinity and s_prev_1 <= s_current_1:

          previous_dp1 + c[i]

   So code:

   prev_s0 = s[i-1]

   prev_s1 = reversed_str[i-1]

   curr_s0 = s[i]

   curr_s1 = reversed_str[i]

   curr_dp0 = infinity

   if prev_s0 <= curr_s0:

       curr_dp0 = previous_dp0

   if prev_s1 <= curr_s0:

       if previous_dp1 < curr_dp0:

           curr_dp0 = previous_dp1

   curr_dp1 = infinity

   if prev_s0 <= curr_s1:

       temp = previous_dp0 + c[i]

       if temp < curr_dp1:

           curr_dp1 = temp

   if prev_s1 <= curr_s1:

       temp = previous_dp1 + c[i]

       if temp < curr_dp1:

           curr_dp1 = temp

   Then, set previous_dp0 and previous_dp1 to curr_dp0 and curr_dp1.

   If both are infinity, return -1.

At the end, the answer is the minimum of previous_dp0 and previous_dp1.

But wait, after processing all i up to n-1, the final state is previous_dp0 and previous_dp1. So the answer is min(previous_dp0, previous_dp1), if either is not infinity.

But what about when i is n-1? Because n starts from 2, the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1 (since Python uses 0-based indices). For example, if n=2, then i=1 (the second string) is processed once.

Yes.

Now, code-wise, we can represent infinity as a very large number, like 1e18, which is larger than the maximum possible sum of c (since each c can be up to 1e9 and n is up to 1e5, sum can be up to 1e14, so 1e18 is safe).

So code steps:

In Python:

n = int(input())

c = list(map(int, input().split()))

strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

reversed_str = [s[::-1] for s in strings]

Then, initial previous_dp0 and previous_dp1.

prev0 = 0 if 0 <= ... Wait, initial for i=0:

prev0 is 0 (cost of not reversing the first string).

prev1 is c[0] (cost of reversing first string).

Then, for i in range(1, n):

   curr_s = strings[i]

   curr_s_rev = reversed_str[i]

   prev_s = strings[i-1]

   prev_s_rev = reversed_str[i-1]

   new0 = infinity

   new1 = infinity

   # Check transitions to new0 (current not reversed)

   if prev0 < infinity:

       if prev_s <= curr_s:

           if new0 > prev0:

               new0 = prev0

   if prev1 < infinity:

       if prev_s_rev <= curr_s:

           if new0 > prev1:

               new0 = prev1

   # Check transitions to new1 (current reversed, cost c[i])

   if prev0 < infinity:

       if prev_s <= curr_s_rev:

           candidate = prev0 + c[i]

           if candidate < new1:

               new1 = candidate

   if prev1 < infinity:

       if prev_s_rev <= curr_s_rev:

           candidate = prev1 + c[i]

           if candidate < new1:

               new1 = candidate

   # Update previous values

   prev0, prev1 = new0, new1

   # Check if both are infinity

   if prev0 == float('inf') and prev1 == float('inf'):

       print(-1)

       exit()

After processing all, the answer is min(prev0, prev1). If that's infinity, output -1.

But in code, we can check if the min is infinity. If so, output -1.

So:

result = min(prev0, prev1)

print(result if result != float('inf') else -1)

Now, let's test this code against the examples.

First example:

Input:

2

1 2

ba

ac

Reversed strings are 'ab' and 'ca'.

Processing first string (i=0):

prev0 = 0 (cost of not reversing 'ba' → 'ba')

prev1 = 1 (cost of reversing 'ba' → 'ab')

Then i=1 (second string):

curr_s is 'ac', curr_s_rev is 'ca'.

prev_s is 'ba', prev_s_rev is 'ab'.

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'ac'):

Check if prev0's string 'ba' <= 'ac' → 'ba' > 'ac' → no. So prev0 (0) is invalid.

Check if prev1's string 'ab' <= 'ac' → yes. So new0 = prev1 (1).

Transitions to new1 (reversed 'ca'):

Check prev0 (0) and 'ba' <= 'ca' → yes. So candidate is 0 + 2 = 2.

Check prev1 (1) and 'ab' <= 'ca' → yes. candidate is 1 + 2 = 3. So new1 is min(2,3) → 2.

So new0 is 1, new1 is 2.

prev0 becomes 1, prev1 becomes 2.

Result is min(1, 2) → 1. Correct.

Second example:

3

1 3 1

aa

ba

ac

Reversed strings:

aa → 'aa', ba → 'ab', ac → 'ca'.

Processing:

i=0:

prev0=0, prev1=1.

i=1:

curr_s is 'ba', reversed is 'ab'.

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'ba'):

prev0 (string 'aa') <= 'ba' → yes. So new0 can take prev0 (0).

prev1 (string 'aa' reversed is 'aa') <= 'ba' → yes. prev1 is 1. So new0 is min(0, 1) → 0.

Transitions to new1 (reversed 'ab'):

prev0's 'aa' <= 'ab' → yes. cost 0 +3=3.

prev1's 'aa' <= 'ab' → yes. cost 1+3=4. So new1 is 3.

prev0=0, prev1=3.

i=2:

curr_s is 'ac', reversed is 'ca'.

prev_s is 'ba' (original), reversed is 'ab'.

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'ac'):

prev0 (current is 'ba') → 'ba' <= 'ac'? 'ba' is 'b' vs 'a' in first character. So 'ba' > 'ac'. So no.

prev1's string is 'ab' (reversed 'ba' → 'ab') → 'ab' <= 'ac' → yes. prev1 is 3. So new0 is 3.

Transitions to new1 (reversed 'ca'):

prev0's string is 'ba' <= 'ca' → yes. candidate is 0 (prev0's cost is 0) + 1 (c[2] is 1) → 1.

prev1's 'ab' <= 'ca' → yes. candidate is 3 + 1 =4.

So new1 is min(1,4) →1.

So new0=3, new1=1.

result is min(3,1)=1. Correct.

Third example:

2

5 5

bbb

aaa

Reversed strings are 'bbba' → wait, original strings are 'bbb' and 'aaa'.

Reversed strings are 'bbb' and 'aaa'.

So for i=0:

prev0=0 (cost to not reverse 'bbb' → 'bbb').

prev1=5 (cost to reverse 'bbb' → 'bbb').

i=1:

current_s is 'aaa', reversed is 'aaa'.

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'aaa'):

prev0's 'bbb' <= 'aaa' → no. prev1's 'bbb' <= 'aaa' → no. So new0 is inf.

Transitions to new1 (reversed 'aaa', cost 5). Check prev0's 'bbb' <= 'aaa' → no. prev1's 'bbb' <= 'aaa' → no. So new1 is inf.

Thus, output -1. Correct.

Fourth example:

2

3 3

aaa

aa

Reversed strings are 'aaa' and 'aa'.

i=0: prev0=0, prev1=3.

i=1: current_s is 'aa', reversed 'aa'.

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'aa'):

prev0's 'aaa' <= 'aa' → 'aaa' is longer than 'aa' and is not a prefix. Wait, 'aa' is a prefix of 'aaa'? 'aa' is the first two characters of 'aaa', but 'aa' is shorter. So according to problem statement, 'aa' is lex smaller than 'aaa'. Wait, the problem's lex order says:

"A is lex smaller than B if it is shorter than B and is its prefix, or ..."

So in this case, 'aa' is shorter than 'aaa' (length 2 vs 3) and is a prefix. So 'aa' is considered lex smaller than 'aaa'. So the original order is 'aaa' followed by 'aa', which is not allowed. Reversed strings would be 'aaa' and 'aa' as well, since they reverse to the same. So no possible way.

Wait, in the input, the two strings are 'aaa' and 'aa'. So after processing the first string, the options are 'aaa' (cost 0) or 'aaa' (cost 3). For the second string, which is 'aa', the reversed is 'aa'.

So when processing i=1 (second string):

Check transitions to new0 (not reversed 'aa'):

prev0's string is 'aaa' → 'aaa' <= 'aa'? No. Because 'aaa' is longer than 'aa' and is not a prefix. Wait, 'aa' is a prefix of 'aaa'? The first two characters are 'aa', so 'aa' is a prefix of 'aaa'. So according to the problem's first condition, since 'aa' is shorter and is a prefix of 'aaa', then 'aa' is lex smaller than 'aaa'? Wait no, the problem says "A is lex smaller than B if it is shorter than B and is its prefix". So in this case, 'aa' is shorter than 'aaa' and is a prefix of 'aaa', so 'aa' < 'aaa' → but in the case where the previous string is 'aaa' and the current is 'aa', then 'aaa' > 'aa' → which is not allowed.

Wait, the problem requires the sequence to be sorted in lex order. So the first string's form (original or reversed) must be <= the second string's form.

In this example, the first string is 'aaa', the second is 'aa'.

Original forms: 'aaa' followed by 'aa' → 'aaa' is longer than 'aa' but is 'aa' a prefix? Yes, 'aa' is a prefix of 'aaa'. So according to the problem's definition, 'aa' is lex smaller than 'aaa' (because 'aa' is shorter and is a prefix of 'aaa') → so the sequence would have 'aaa' followed by 'aa', which is not allowed. So the order is invalid.

So the code would check for transitions from the first string's possible states (0 or 1) to the second's possible states (0 or 1).

But the first string's original is 'aaa', reversed is 'aaa'. The second string's original is 'aa', reversed is 'aa'.

So when considering transitions to new0 (current is 'aa'):

prev0 is 'aaa' (original) <= 'aa'? No. Because 'aa' is shorter than 'aaa' and is a prefix. So 'aa' is lex smaller than 'aaa', which implies that 'aaa' is larger than 'aa'. So the comparison 'aaa' <= 'aa' is False.

prev1 is 'aaa' (reversed) <= 'aa' → same as above. False.

So new0 is infinity.

Transitions to new1 (current reversed 'aa'):

same as above, comparing 'aaa' and 'aa' → again, 'aaa' > 'aa'. So transitions are not possible.

Thus, new0 and new1 are infinity. So output -1. Correct.

So the code works for all the examples.

Now, let's think about possible edge cases.

Case where all strings are the same. Then, it's allowed. The cost would be 0 if all are not reversed, or some combination. For example, if n=3, c is [0,0,0], then all reversed or not, it's allowed. So the minimal cost is 0.

Another case where some strings can't be ordered. For example:

n=2, strings 'cba' and 'abc'. Original order 'cba' and 'abc' → 'cba' is larger than 'abc' (since 'c' > 'a'). But if the first is reversed (becomes 'abc'), and the second is not reversed (abc), then the order is 'abc' <= 'abc', which is allowed. So the cost is c[0] + 0.

So the code would find this.

Another case: strings of varying lengths. Like 'a' followed by 'ab'. Then, 'a' is a prefix of 'ab', so 'a' < 'ab' → allowed.

But if the first is reversed (still 'a') and the second is not reversed ('ab'), it's allowed.

So code should handle this.

Now, the code seems correct.

Now, the code in Python:

But what about the use of infinity? In Python, we can use float('inf').

But for handling the initial steps:

prev0 and prev1 are initialized to 0 and c[0].

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

new0 and new1 are initialized to infinity.

Then, check possible transitions.

Now, let's code this:

Read n.

c = list of integers.

strings = list of strings.

reversed_str = list of reversed strings.

prev0 = 0

prev1 = c[0]

for i in range(1, n):

    curr_s = strings[i]

    curr_rev = reversed_str[i]

    prev_s = strings[i-1]

    prev_rev = reversed_str[i-1]

    # transitions to new0 (current not reversed)

    new0 = float('inf')

    # check if previous states can transition to new0

    if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_s:

        new0 = prev0

    if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_s:

        new0 = min(new0, prev1)

    # transitions to new1 (current reversed)

    new1 = float('inf')

    if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_rev:

        new1 = prev0 + c[i]

    if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_rev:

        new1 = min(new1, prev1 + c[i])

    prev0, prev1 = new0, new1

    if prev0 == float('inf') and prev1 == float('inf'):

        print(-1)

        exit()

result = min(prev0, prev1)

print(result if result != float('inf') else -1)

Yes.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    c = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    strings = [input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip() for _ in range(n)]
    reversed_str = [s[::-1] for s in strings]

    if n == 0:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return

    # Initialize previous states
    prev0 = 0  # not reversed
    prev1 = c[0]  # reversed

    for i in range(1, n):
        curr_s = strings[i]
        curr_rev = reversed_str[i]
        prev_s = strings[i-1]
        prev_rev = reversed_str[i-1]
        
        new0 = float('inf')
        new1 = float('inf')
        
        # Transition to new0 (current not reversed)
        if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_s:
            new0 = prev0
        if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_s:
            new0 = min(new0, prev1)
        
        # Transition to new1 (current reversed)
        if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_rev:
            new1 = prev0 + c[i]
        if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_rev:
            new1 = min(new1, prev1 + c[i])
        
        prev0, prev1 = new0, new1
        
        if prev0 == float('inf') and prev1 == float('inf'):
            print(-1, file=output_stream)
            return

    result = min(prev0, prev1)
    print(result if result != float('inf') else -1, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()

Another test case: the fourth example.

n=2.

prev0=0 (strings[0] is 'aaa'), prev1=3 (reversed_str[0] is 'aaa').

i=1:

curr_s is 'aa', curr_rev is 'aa'.

prev_s is 'aaa', prev_rev is 'aaa'.

Check transitions to new0:

prev_s 'aaa' <= 'aa' → 'aa' is shorter and is a prefix of 'aaa', so according to problem statement, 'aa' is lex smaller than 'aaa' → so 'aaa' <= 'aa' is False. So no transition from prev0.

prev_rev 'aaa' <= 'aa' → same as above. So new0 remains inf.

Transitions to new1:

prev_s 'aaa' <= curr_rev ('aa') → same as above. False. So new1 remains inf.

Thus, new0 and new1 are inf. So code returns -1.

Thus, code is correct.

Now, considering the problem constraints, the code is O(n) time, with O(n) space for storing the reversed strings. But the reversed strings can be generated on the fly, but storing them is acceptable since the sum is 1e5.

Thus, the code is efficient and should handle all test cases within the time and memory limits.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum energy required to sort a list of strings lexicographically by either reversing each string or leaving it as is. The key challenge is to decide for each string whether to reverse it or not, ensuring the sequence remains sorted while minimizing the energy cost.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with State Tracking**: We use dynamic programming to track the minimum energy required up to each string, considering two states for each string: reversed or not reversed.
2. **State Transitions**: For each string, we check the valid transitions from the previous string's states (reversed or not reversed) to the current string's states. This ensures that each transition maintains the lexicographical order.
3. **Efficiency**: By maintaining only the previous state's values, we optimize space complexity to O(1) and time complexity to O(n), where n is the number of strings. Each string comparison is handled in O(L) time, where L is the length of the string, ensuring the solution is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
n = int(input())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
reversed_str = [s[::-1] for s in strings]

if n == 0:
    print(0)
    exit()

# Initialize previous states
prev0 = 0  # not reversed
prev1 = c[0]  # reversed

for i in range(1, n):
    curr_s = strings[i]
    curr_rev = reversed_str[i]
    prev_s = strings[i-1]
    prev_rev = reversed_str[i-1]
    
    new0 = float('inf')
    new1 = float('inf')
    
    # Transition to new0 (current not reversed)
    if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_s:
        new0 = prev0
    if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_s:
        new0 = min(new0, prev1)
    
    # Transition to new1 (current reversed)
    if prev0 != float('inf') and prev_s <= curr_rev:
        new1 = prev0 + c[i]
    if prev1 != float('inf') and prev_rev <= curr_rev:
        new1 = min(new1, prev1 + c[i])
    
    prev0, prev1 = new0, new1
    
    if prev0 == float('inf') and prev1 == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
        exit()

result = min(prev0, prev1)
print(result if result != float('inf') else -1)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: We start by reading the number of strings and their respective energy costs. Each string is stored along with its reversed version.
2. **Initialization**: The initial states for the first string are set as the cost of not reversing it (0) and the cost of reversing it (c[0]).
3. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: For each subsequent string, we compute the minimum energy required for both states (reversed and not reversed) based on valid transitions from the previous string's states. This ensures the sequence remains lexicographically ordered.
4. **Early Termination**: If both states become invalid (infinite energy) at any point, we immediately output -1 and terminate.
5. **Result Calculation**: After processing all strings, the minimum energy required to maintain the order is the minimum of the two states of the last string.

This approach efficiently tracks the minimum energy required using dynamic programming with constant space, ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.
