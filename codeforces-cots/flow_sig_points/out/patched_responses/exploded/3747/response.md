<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the number of possible letters Polycarpus can tell such that, regardless of which of the possible candidate words is the hidden one, choosing that letter will definitely reveal at least one new character. Also, he can't choose letters that are already revealed.

First, I need to understand what the revealed letters mean. The revealed letters are exactly the ones that Polycarpus has already guessed. So any letters that are present in the revealed positions (non-*) are already guessed. So any candidate word must have those letters in those positions, and the other positions (stars) must not have any of the already revealed letters. Because if they did, then those letters would have been revealed in previous turns. Because when you guess a letter, all instances are revealed. So for example, if a candidate word has a letter 'a' in a position that's currently a star, but 'a' is already revealed (i.e., present in the revealed string), that candidate is invalid, because when 'a' was guessed before, that position would have been revealed. So the candidate words must not have any of the already revealed letters in the star positions.

So the first step is to filter the list of candidate words to only those that are possible given the current revealed state and the previously guessed letters.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the hidden word is one of the given m words, so we need to consider only those candidates that are compatible with the current revealed state and the previous guesses.

So how to check if a candidate word is compatible?

For each candidate word, check two things:

1. All revealed positions (non-*) in the current state must match the candidate's letters. For example, if the current state is a**d, then the candidate's first character must be 'a' and the fourth must be 'd'.

2. The candidate's letters in the star positions (still hidden) must not be any of the letters that have already been revealed. Because if they were, then when that letter was guessed earlier, all occurrences would have been revealed, including that position. So any candidate that has a star position containing a letter already in the revealed set is invalid.

So, for example, in the third example:

The revealed state is a*a. The letters already revealed are 'a'. So any candidate word with a star position (like the middle position here) that is 'a' is invalid. Because if the candidate was 'aaa', then the middle a would have been revealed when 'a' was guessed. But since in the current state it's a star, that candidate is invalid. So the only possible candidate is 'aba'.

So the first step is to filter the list of candidates to only those that meet these two conditions.

Once we have the possible candidates, we need to find the letters that Polycarpus can choose such that, for every possible candidate in the filtered list, choosing that letter will reveal at least one new character.

Additionally, the letter chosen must not have been revealed already. So the possible letters to choose are those that are not present in the revealed set.

So the steps are:

1. Extract the set of already revealed letters (the unique letters in the revealed string that are not *). Let's call this S.

2. For each candidate word, check:

   a. All non-* positions in the current state match the candidate's letters.

   b. All * positions in the current state of the candidate must not have letters in S.

   Only the candidates that satisfy both a and b are considered possible.

3. Now, for each possible candidate, collect the set of letters that are present in their * positions (since those are the letters that could potentially be guessed next). But wait, the letters in the * positions of the candidate's word are the letters that are not in S. So the possible letters Polycarpus can choose are letters not in S, and that are present in at least one of the * positions of the candidate.

But the problem is that the hidden word could be any of the possible candidates. So for a letter to be a valid choice for Polycarpus, it must satisfy the following: for every possible candidate, choosing that letter will result in at least one new position being revealed. Because the host will reveal all occurrences of the letter in the hidden word. So the letter must be present in all possible candidates' * positions. Because if even one candidate does not have that letter in any of its * positions, then choosing that letter might not reveal anything (if that candidate is the hidden word), so the host would not reveal any new letters. Therefore, the chosen letter must be present in the * positions of all possible candidates.

Wait, no. Because if a candidate has that letter in any of the * positions, then choosing that letter would reveal those positions. But the problem requires that for the chosen letter, the host will assuredly reveal at least one more letter. So regardless of which candidate is the hidden one, choosing that letter must result in at least one new position being revealed. So the letter must be present in the * positions of every candidate. Because if any candidate does not have that letter in any of its * positions, then if that candidate is the hidden word, the letter would not be present in the hidden word's * positions (since the candidate's * positions are the hidden letters of the word), so choosing that letter would reveal nothing. Therefore, to ensure that the host must reveal at least one new letter, the letter must be present in all candidates' * positions. Because only then, no matter which candidate is the hidden word, choosing the letter will reveal at least one new character.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, suppose we have candidates A and B. Suppose for letter 'x', candidate A has 'x' in some * positions, but candidate B does not. Then, if the hidden word is B, then choosing 'x' would not reveal any new letters, because B's * positions don't have 'x'. So in that case, the letter 'x' would not be a valid choice, because the host might not reveal anything. Therefore, the letter must be present in at least one * position of every candidate.

So, the approach is:

- For a candidate letter c (not in S), check whether every possible candidate (after filtering) has at least one occurrence of c in their * positions (i.e., the positions where the current state is *).

If that is true for all candidates, then c is a valid choice.

So the steps:

1. Process the input, including the revealed string and the list of possible words.

2. Filter the list of possible words to only those that are compatible with the revealed state and the already guessed letters (S).

3. For each candidate letter c not in S:

   a. Check if every candidate in the filtered list has at least one c in their * positions (as per the current revealed state).

   b. If yes, then c is a valid choice. Count it.

4. The total count of such c's is the answer.

So how to implement this?

First, collect the set S. S is the set of letters present in the revealed string (excluding *).

Then, for each candidate word, check:

- For each position where the revealed string is not *, the candidate's letter must match.

- For each position where the revealed string is *, the candidate's letter must not be in S.

Only such candidates are kept.

Once we have the filtered list of possible candidates, we need to determine for each possible letter c not in S, whether all candidates have at least one c in their * positions (the positions where the current state is *).

Wait, but for a candidate word, the * positions in the current state are the positions that are still hidden. So for each candidate, the letters in their * positions are the letters that are in the hidden word's positions that are not yet revealed. So when you choose a letter c, for that candidate, if any of their * positions (in the current state) has c, then choosing c would reveal those positions. But to ensure that, for the hidden word (whatever it is), choosing c will reveal at least one, c must be present in the * positions of all possible candidates. Because if even one candidate doesn't have c in any of their * positions, then if that candidate is the hidden word, choosing c would not reveal anything.

So the check for a candidate letter c is: for every candidate in the filtered list, does it contain c in any of its * positions (as per the current state)?

If yes for all, then c is valid.

So to implement this:

Collect the current state's * positions (their indices).

For each candidate in the filtered list, for each of their letters in these * positions, note the letters.

Then, for a letter c (not in S), check for all candidates whether their * positions contain at least one c.

If yes for all, then count c.

So the plan is:

1. Determine the set S (letters already guessed).

2. Collect the positions where the current state is * (call these star_positions).

3. Filter the candidates to those that match the revealed positions and have no S letters in their star positions.

4. For each possible candidate in the filtered list, collect the set of letters present in their star_positions.

5. For each possible c (letters not in S and not already guessed), check if for every candidate in the filtered list, c is present in their star_positions letters.

So how to do this?

For each candidate in the filtered list, we can precompute the set of letters present in their star positions. Then, for a letter c to be valid, it must be present in the intersection of all these sets.

So the valid letters are the letters in the intersection of all the sets of letters present in the star positions of each candidate, minus the letters already in S.

So the answer is the size of that intersection set minus any letters in S (since S is already excluded).

So, steps:

- After filtering, collect for each candidate the set of letters in their star positions.

- Then, compute the intersection of all these sets across all candidates.

- The valid letters are the letters in this intersection that are not in S.

The count of these letters is the answer.

Yes! That makes sense.

So for example, in the first sample input:

Revealed state is a**d. S is {'a', 'd'}. The filtered candidates are 'abcd' and 'acbd' (assuming they meet the criteria). Let's check:

For the first candidate 'abcd':

The star positions are positions 2 and 3. Letters 'b' and 'c'. So their letters are {'b','c'}.

Second candidate 'acbd': positions 2 and 3 have 'c' and 'b'. So letters {'c','b'}.

The intersection is {'b','c'}, which are letters not in S. So the answer is 2.

In the second example:

Revealed state is lo*er. S is {'l','o','e','r'}. The candidates are 'lover' and 'loser'.

The star position is position 3 (0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is 5 characters. So the third character is a star. Let's see:

For 'lover' → position 3 (assuming 0-based?) or 3rd position (assuming 1-based). Let's clarify: the input is 5 characters. For 'lo*er', the third character is *. So for the candidate 'lover' (assuming 1-based), the third character is 'v'. For 'loser', it's 's'. The star positions are only the third position.

So the star positions for each candidate are:

For 'lover', the star position is 'v'. So letters in star positions: {'v'}.

For 'loser', the star position is 's'. Letters in star positions: {'s'}.

The intersection is empty. So no letters can be chosen. So answer is 0.

In the third example:

Revealed state is a*a. The letters revealed are {'a'}.

The candidates are 'aaa' and 'aba'. Let's check which are valid:

For 'aaa' → the star position is the second character. Its letter is 'a', which is in S (already revealed). So this candidate is invalid. So the filtered candidates must exclude 'aaa' because the star positions (position 2) in the candidate is 'a', which is in S. So the only valid candidate is 'aba'.

So after filtering, the candidates are just 'aba'. The star positions are positions 1 and 3 (since the revealed state is a*a, assuming the stars are positions 1 and 3 if 0-based? Wait, the input is 3 characters. Let's see:

Original revealed state is "a*a". So positions 0 and 2 (0-based) are 'a's, position 1 is a star. So the star positions is position 1. So for the candidate 'aba', the star position is 'b'.

So the letters in star positions of the candidate 'aba' is {'b'}.

The intersection is {'b'}, which is not in S. So answer is 1.

So the approach is correct.

So the steps are:

1. Read n.

2. Read the revealed string.

3. Read m and then the m words.

4. Compute S: the set of letters in the revealed string that are not *.

5. For each candidate word, check:

   a. For every position where revealed is not *, the candidate's character must match.

   b. For every position where revealed is *, the candidate's character must not be in S.

   If both a and b are true, the candidate is valid.

6. Collect all valid candidates.

7. For each valid candidate, collect the set of letters in their * positions (positions where revealed is *).

8. Compute the intersection of all these sets. That's the letters that are present in all candidates' * positions.

9. Subtract S from this intersection. The size of the result is the answer.

So now, implementing this in Python.

Now, code steps:

First, read n, then the revealed string. Then m, then m words.

Compute S as the set of characters in the revealed string that are not '*'.

Then, for each word in the list, check:

   a. For each position in the revealed string:

      if revealed[i] != '*', then word[i] must equal revealed[i].

   b. For each position where revealed[i] is '*', word[i] must not be in S.

If both a and b are satisfied, the word is a valid candidate.

Once the valid candidates are filtered, collect for each candidate the set of letters in their * positions (i.e., where the revealed string is '*').

The * positions are the indices where the revealed string has '*'.

Then, the letters in these positions for each candidate form a set. The intersection of all these sets across candidates is the set of letters that are present in all candidates' * positions.

The valid letters are those in this intersection that are not in S.

The count of such letters is the answer.

Now, let's code this.

But first, handling the positions:

For example, in the first sample:

revealed = 'a**d' → the * positions are indices 1 and 2 (if 0-based).

So for each candidate word, the letters in positions 1 and 2 are considered.

So code steps:

star_positions = [i for i, c in enumerate(revealed) if c == '*']

For each valid candidate word:

   letters_in_star_pos = {word[i] for i in star_positions}

Then, collect all these sets.

The intersection is the set of letters that are in every letters_in_star_pos.

Now, compute the intersection:

valid_letters = set(all possible letters). Wait, no. The intersection is the letters that are present in every candidate's star letters.

So for example, if the candidates are [set1, set2, ...], then the intersection is set1 & set2 & ... .

So in code:

sets = []
for candidate in valid_candidates:
    s = {candidate[i] for i in star_positions}
    sets.append(s)
common = set.intersection(*sets) if sets else set()

Then, answer is the number of letters in common minus letters in S.

But since the letters in S are already excluded (as in the code, the candidate's * positions cannot contain S letters), the letters in common are already not in S. Wait, because the valid candidates have their * positions not containing any S letters (due to condition b). So for a valid candidate, the letters in their * positions are not in S. So the letters in the sets for the candidates are all not in S. Therefore, the intersection of all these sets is a subset of letters not in S. Therefore, we can safely subtract S (but in reality, since S is the set of letters already revealed, and the valid candidates' * positions don't have any S letters, the intersection's letters are not in S. So S ∩ common is empty. So the answer is the size of the common set.

Wait, but wait. Let's see:

The letters in the star positions of the valid candidates are not in S (because the valid candidates must satisfy that their * positions (positions where revealed is *) do not have letters in S. So for each candidate, their star positions' letters are not in S.

Therefore, the letters in common (the intersection) are all not in S. So when we compute common letters, we don't have to subtract S again.

Wait, no. Because S contains the letters that have already been guessed, and the candidate's * positions cannot contain any of those letters (they would have been revealed otherwise). So the letters in the candidate's * positions are not in S.

Therefore, the intersection of all these sets is a subset of letters not in S. Therefore, the valid letters are the letters in this intersection.

So the answer is the size of this intersection.

But wait, in the first sample, the answer was 2 (letters 'b' and 'c'). Which are not in S (S is {'a', 'd'}).

In that case, the intersection is {'b', 'c'}, which is not in S, so the count is 2.

Yes. So the answer is the length of the intersection of all the sets from the valid candidates' star positions.

But wait, what if there are no valid candidates? But the problem states that the hidden word is one of the given m words, and at least one is compatible. So the code can safely assume that valid_candidates is not empty.

So the code steps:

- Compute S.

- Compute star_positions.

- Filter the words to valid_candidates.

- For each valid candidate, collect the letters in their star positions.

- Compute the intersection of all these sets.

- The answer is the size of this intersection.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in code:

Third example:

Input:

3

a*a

2

aaa

aba

revealed is 'a', '*', 'a'.

S is {'a'}.

star_positions is index 1.

Check each word.

First word 'aaa':

Check positions:

0: 'a' → matches.

1: 'a' → which is in S (since S is {'a'}). So this candidate is invalid.

Second word 'aba':

position 0: 'a' → matches.

1: 'b' → not in S. So valid.

position 2: 'a' → matches.

So valid_candidates is only 'aba'.

The star positions (index 1) → 'b' → set {'b'}.

So intersection is {'b'}. Size is 1. Correct.

So code works.

Now, code needs to be written efficiently.

Possible optimizations:

- Precompute star_positions.

- For each candidate, check validity quickly.

But for m up to 1000 and n up to 50, the code is manageable.

But in Python, with list comprehensions and sets, it should be efficient enough.

Another edge case: when there are no letters in the intersection. For example, all candidates have different letters in their star positions. Then output is 0.

Another edge case: if the common letters are in S. Wait, but according to the code, the letters in the star positions of valid candidates are not in S. So the common letters are all not in S.

So the code is correct.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.
