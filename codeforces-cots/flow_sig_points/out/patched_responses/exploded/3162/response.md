Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine which option the child will choose based on the given algorithm. Let's read the problem statement carefully.

The child's algorithm is as follows: first, check if any choice is "great". A choice is great if either:
1. Its description is at least twice as short as all others. So, for example, if the length of this choice is L, all others must be >= 2*L.
OR
2. Its description is at least twice as long as all others. Here, L is the length of the choice, and all others must be <= L/2.

If there's exactly one great choice, the child picks it. Otherwise, they pick C.

So the plan is to read the four options (A, B, C, D), compute their lengths (excluding the prefix like "A."), then for each option, check if it's great according to the above conditions. Then collect all the great options. If exactly one exists, return that. Else, return C.

Hmm, let's think about the steps.

First, input handling. Each of the four lines starts with "A.", "B.", etc. So for each line, we need to skip the first two characters (since "X." is the prefix) and take the rest as the description. The length of each is the number of characters after the prefix. So for example, the first line starts with "A.", then the rest is the description. So for each choice, len = len(line) - 2.

Wait, but the problem says each description is non-empty. So lines are at least 2 characters, like "A.a".

Once we have the lengths for all four options, we need to check for each option whether it's great.

For each option i (A, B, C, D), we need to compare its length with the lengths of the other three. Let's denote the length of i as L. Then for the first condition (twice shorter), all other lengths must be >= 2*L. For the second condition (twice longer), all other lengths must be <= L/2 (since L is at least twice the others, so others are <= L/2).

So for each of the four options, check if either condition holds.

Once we have all the great options, count them. If exactly one, choose that. Otherwise, choose C.

Let's think about edge cases. For example, when multiple options meet the condition. Like, two options being twice longer than others. Or three, etc. Then the count is more than one, so the child picks C.

So the steps are:

1. Read four lines. For each, extract the length after the prefix.
2. For each of the four choices, check if it's a great choice.
3. Collect all great choices.
4. If exactly one, output it. Else, output C.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

First, read the four lines, extract their lengths.

Sample input 1:

A.VFleaKing... (length 39)
B.Picks... (35)
C.Picking... (37)
D.Ftiasch... (15)

For D, length is 15. Check if all others are >= 2*15=30. Let's see: 39 >=30, yes. 35 >=30 yes. 37 >=30 yes. So D is great. Others: check A's length 39. Is it twice longer than others? Let's see: 39*2=78. Are all others >=78? No. So A is not great. So only D is great. Output D.

Another sample:

Input 3:

A.c → length 1-2? Wait, no. Wait, the lines are like "A.c", so the prefix is "A.", then the description is "c". So the length is 1. Similarly, B is "cc" → length 2. C is "c" → 1, D is "c" →1.

Check B's length (2). Check if it's twice longer than others. The others are 1,1,1. So 2 >= 2*1 (others are 1, which is 1 <= 2/2=1). So yes. So B is great. Others: A's length is 1. For the first condition, others (2,1,1) need to be >=2*1=2. But B's length is 2, which is equal. So A's first condition is not met. The second condition: others must be <= 0.5, which is not. So A is not great. Similarly for C and D. So only B is great. So output B.

So the logic works.

Now, code steps.

First, read four lines. Then for each line, take the part after the first two characters (prefix), then compute the length.

In Python, for each line, len = len(line) - 2.

But wait, the line could have leading or trailing whitespace? The problem says that each description is non-empty and consists of certain characters. So perhaps each line starts with X. followed by the description. So the input lines are exactly as given. So, for example, line 1 is "A.abc", so the length is len("abc") =3.

So code steps:

lines = [input().strip() for _ in range(4)]

But then, for each line, the length is len(line) - 2. Because the first two characters are "X." (assuming that the input is correct as per problem statement). So for each of the four lines, the length is the length of the entire line minus 2.

So:

descriptions = [len(line) - 2 for line in (input().strip() for _ in range(4))]

Wait, but maybe the input could have leading or trailing whitespace? The problem statement says each description is non-empty and consists of certain characters, but the line as input includes the "X." prefix. So the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? The problem says that the descriptions are non-empty. Wait, the problem says:

Each description is non-empty and consists of at most 100 characters. So the actual description after X. is non-empty. But the line is given as, for example, "A.abc", so the line has at least two characters. So when we process the line, we can safely take everything after the first two characters.

So for each of the four lines, the code can be:

a_length = len(input().strip()) - 2
b_length = len(input().strip()) - 2
c_length = len(input().strip()) - 2
d_length = len(input().strip()) - 2

Or, perhaps read them all into a list:

lengths = []
for _ in range(4):
    line = input().strip()
    lengths.append(len(line) - 2)

Then the order is A, B, C, D. So the list indices 0,1,2,3 correspond to A, B, C, D.

Then for each of the four options (A is index 0, B index1, etc.), check if it's great.

So for each i in 0-3:

current_length = lengths[i]

others = [lengths[j] for j in range(4) if j != i]

Check for condition 1: current_length * 2 <= min(others). Because if all others are >= 2*current_length, then min(others) >= 2*current_length.

Or wait, for condition1 (current is twice shorter), all others must be >= 2*current_length. So for all other lengths, they are >= 2 * current_length. So the minimum of the other lengths must be >= 2*current_length.

So condition1 = all(other >= 2 * current_length for other in others)

Similarly, condition2 (current is twice longer): all other <= current_length / 2.

But since current_length and others are integers, we have to be careful with integer division. For example, if current_length is 5, then others must be <= 2.5, i.e., <=2. So current_length must be even? Or not? Let's see.

The problem statement says "at least twice longer than all others". So the current_length must be >= 2 * other_length for all others.

Wait, no. Wait the condition is:

If the current choice is at least twice as long as all others. So current_length >= 2 * other_length for every other_length in others.

Because if current_length is 5, and another is 3, then 5 is not >= 2*3=6. So that's not allowed.

Wait no. Let me read the problem statement again:

"If there is some choice whose description at least twice shorter than all other descriptions, or at least twice longer than all other descriptions, then the child thinks the choice is great."

Ah, the wording here is a bit ambiguous. So for the twice longer case: the current choice's description is at least twice as long as all others. So for each other choice, current_length >= 2 * other_length.

Yes, that's correct. Because the current is twice longer than each other.

So for the current to be great via condition2, all other lengths must be <= current_length / 2. Because current_length >= 2*other_length for each other.

So for condition2, we need current_length >= 2 * other_length for all others.

So, for each i, for condition1:

others = [lengths[j] for j in range(4) if j != i]

condition1 = all(other >= 2 * current_length for other in others)

condition2 = all(current_length >= 2 * other for other in others)

if either condition1 or condition2 is true, then the choice is great.

Once we collect all great choices, we check if exactly one exists. If yes, output the corresponding letter. Else, output C.

Now, how to implement this.

Let's code it step by step.

First, read the four lengths.

lengths = []
for _ in range(4):
    line = input().strip()
    lengths.append(len(line) - 2)

Then, for each i in 0-3, check if it's great.

great = []
for i in range(4):
    current = lengths[i]
    others = [lengths[j] for j in range(4) if j != i]
    cond1 = all(other >= 2 * current for other in others)
    cond2 = all(current >= 2 * other for other in others)
    if cond1 or cond2:
        great.append(i)

Then, the great list contains the indices (0 to 3) of the great options.

If len(great) == 1, then output the corresponding letter (A is 0, B 1, C 2, D 3). Else, output 'C'.

So:

if len(great) == 1:
    print(chr(ord('A') + great[0]))
else:
    print('C')

But wait, in the third sample input, B is the great choice. The input lines are:

A.c → len 1 (after subtracting 2)
B.cc → len 2
C.c → len 1
D.c → len 1

So the code for B (index1) would check others as 1,1,1. So cond2: 2 >= 2*1 (others are 1,1,1). So 2 >= 2*1 → 2 >=2, which is true. So condition2 holds. So B is great.

Yes.

Another example: the second sample input.

Input lines:

A.ab → len 2 (after subtracting 2)
B.abcde → len5-2=5-2? Wait the line is "B.abcde". The length is 5 (since "B." is two characters, and the rest is 5 characters). So len is 5-2=3? Wait wait, no: the line is "B.abcde" → the full line is 6 characters. So len("abcde") is 5. Wait, no. For example, the line is "B.abcde". The first two characters are 'B.', then the description is 'abcde', which is 5 characters. So the length is 5. So len(line) is 7 characters (B. plus 5 letters), so len(line) -2 is 5. So in the second sample:

A.ab → len 2 (after subtracting 2 from len("A.ab")=3: 3-2=1? Wait wait, no. Wait "A.ab" is the input line. The first two characters are 'A.', then the description is 'ab', which is two characters. So the len is 2. So len(line) is 3 characters. So 3-2=1? Wait no. Wait the input line is "A.ab" → the line's length is 4 characters. Because 'A.' is two, then 'ab' is two. So len(line) is 4, so len(line) -2 is 2. So the length is 2. So the sample input is:

A.ab → len 2 (A is 0)
B.abcde → len 5 (B is 1)
C.ab → len 2 (C is 2)
D.abc → len 3 (D is 3)

So the lengths are [2,5,2,3]. So for each choice:

A: check others (5,2,3). For condition1: 2 * 2=4. Are all others >=4? 5 >=4 yes, 2 >=4 no. So condition1 not met. For condition2: 2 >= 2*5? No. So no. So A not great.

B: length 5. others are 2,2,3. For condition1: 5*2=10. Others must be >=10. 2 is not. So no. Condition2: 5 >= 2*2 (4), yes. 5 >= 2*2 (4) yes. 5 >= 2*3 (6) → 5 >=6? No. So condition2 not met. So B is not great.

C: others are 5,2,3. Same as A. So condition1: 2*2=4. others are 5,2,3. 5 >=4 yes, 2 >=4 no. So no. Condition2: 2 >= 2*5 → no. So C not great.

D: length3. others are 2,5,2. For condition1: 3*2=6. others must be >=6. 2 and 5 are not. So no. For condition2: 3 >= 2*2=4 → no. So D not great.

So no great options. So output is C.

So code works.

Now, code:

Read the four lengths.

Then for each of the four options, compute conditions.

Now, possible optimizations. Since the problem has small input size (4 elements), even with O(4*3) operations per check, it's negligible. So code is straightforward.

Another thing to think about: possible floating points, but since all lengths are integers, all conditions can be checked with integer arithmetic.

So the code seems correct.

Now, code in Python:

Read the four lines. Then process lengths.

But in Python, the input is read line by line. So:

After reading each line, subtract 2 from the length.

So code:

lengths = []
for _ in range(4):
    line = input().strip()
    lengths.append(len(line) - 2)

Then check for each i:

great = []
for i in range(4):
    current = lengths[i]
    others = []
    for j in range(4):
        if j != i:
            others.append(lengths[j])
    cond1 = all(other >= 2 * current for other in others)
    cond2 = all(current >= 2 * other for other in others)
    if cond1 or cond2:
        great.append(i)

Then:

if len(great) == 1:
    print(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'][great[0]])
else:
    print('C')

Yes.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    lengths = []
    for _ in range(4):
        line = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
        lengths.append(len(line) - 2)

    great = []
    for i in range(4):
        current = lengths[i]
        others = [lengths[j] for j in range(4) if j != i]
        cond1 = all(other >= 2 * current for other in others)
        cond2 = all(current >= 2 * other for other in others)
        if cond1 or cond2:
            great.append(i)

    if len(great) == 1:
        print('ABCD'[great[0]], file=output_stream)
    else:
        print('C', file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
A.ab
B.abcde
C.ab
D.abc
""",
            "output": \
"""\
C
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Sample 2: output C.

Sample3:

A.c → len 1.

B.cc → len 2.

C.c → len 1.

D.c → len 1.

For B (i=1):

current is 2. others are 1,1,1.

Check condition2: 2 >= 2*1 → 2 >=2 yes. So all others are <=1, which is 2/2=1. So condition2 holds. So B is great.

Others (A, C, D) are not. So great list has 1 (B). So output B.

So code works.

Therefore, the code is correct.
