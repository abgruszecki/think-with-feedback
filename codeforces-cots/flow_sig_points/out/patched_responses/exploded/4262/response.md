Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum value of the function f(l, r) for all possible pairs l and r in the array. The function f is a bit tricky. Let's parse the formula given.

The formula is f(l, r) = sum from i=l to r-1 of |a[i] - a[i+1]| * (-1)^(i-l). Hmm, so each term in the sum depends on the position relative to l. For each i starting at l, the exponent is (i - l), so the sign alternates starting with 0 when i=l. So for the first term (i=l), it's (-1)^0 = 1. Then the next term (i=l+1) would be (-1)^1 = -1, and so on. So the sign alternates starting with positive, then negative, etc.

So the sum is |a[l] - a[l+1]| * 1 + |a[l+1] - a[l+2]| * (-1) + |a[l+2] - a[l+3]| * 1 + ... and this alternates until the last term (r-1).

Wait, but when the length (r - l) is even or odd, how does that affect the number of terms? Let's see. The number of terms is (r-1 - l + 1) = r - l. So for each interval [l, r], there are (r-l) terms, which is the same as the number of steps from l to r-1. So for example, if l=1 and r=5 (as in the first sample), then there are 4 terms. Let's check the sample input 1:

Sample Input 1:
5
1 4 2 3 1

Sample Output is 3. The explanation says that the optimal intervals are [1,2] and [2,5]. Let's see for [2,5]. The sum would be:

i=2: |4-2| * (-1)^(0) = 2 *1 =2
i=3: |2-3| * (-1)^(1) =1*(-1) =-1
i=4: |3-1| * (-1)^(2) =2*1=2
Sum is 2-1+2=3.

Yes, that adds up to 3. So the way the signs alternate is important.

The problem is to find the maximum possible sum over all possible intervals [l, r]. But with n up to 1e5, a naive approach that checks all possible intervals would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the structure of the function f(l, r). The function alternates signs for each consecutive pair. Let's consider that each interval [l, r] can be viewed as a sequence of terms with alternating signs. The key is to find a way to model this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem as a transformation of the array into two different sequences, one starting with a positive sign and the other starting with a negative sign. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum subarray sum in these sequences, similar to the classic Kadane's algorithm problem.

Let me think. Let's precompute the differences. Let's create an array d where d[i] = |a[i] - a[i+1]| for each i from 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based indexing). Then, for each interval [l, r], the sum is the sum of d[l] * 1 + d[l+1] * (-1) + d[l+2] * 1 + ... up to d[r-2] multiplied by (-1)^( (r-2 - l) ), since the number of terms is (r-l-1). Wait, no. Wait, for interval [l, r], the number of terms is (r - l). Each term is d[l], d[l+1], ..., d[r-1]. Because i ranges from l to r-1. Wait, no. Wait, for example, in the first sample, l=2 and r=5 (assuming 1-based), which translates to 0-based l=1, r=4 (if original array is 0-based). Then the terms are d[1], d[2], d[3], which are the differences between a[1]-a[2], a[2]-a[3], a[3]-a[4]. Wait, but the original array in sample 1 is [1,4,2,3,1], so d would be [3, 2, 1, 2]. Then for l=2 (1-based, which is 0-based index 1), r=5 (0-based index 4), the terms are d[1], d[2], d[3], which are 2, 1, 2. The sum is 2*1 + 1*(-1) + 2*1 = 2-1+2=3. So that works.

So the sum is a sequence of d[l], d[l+1], ..., d[r-1], multiplied by alternating signs starting with +1. But the sign alternates based on the position in the sum. For each term at position j in the interval (starting from 0), the sign is (-1)^j. So for the first term, j=0 → sign +1. Second term j=1 → -1, etc.

But the sign for d[k] in the interval [l, r] depends on (k - l). Because j = k - l. So the sign is (-1)^(k-l). So for each interval [l, r], the sum is sum_{k=l}^{r-1} d[k] * (-1)^(k - l).

Hmm. So the sign of each d[k] in the sum depends on the parity of (k - l). So for a given l, the sign starts with +1, then alternates. But if we fix l, then for each possible r >= l+1, the sum is built with these alternating signs.

But considering all possible l and r, how can we compute this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to split the problem into two cases based on whether the starting sign is positive or negative. But since the starting sign is always positive (since when l is fixed, (k - l) starts at 0), perhaps we can model the problem as two separate sequences where each element is d[i] multiplied by 1 if i is even, and -1 if i is odd, but then again, this depends on the starting l.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think of it differently. Let's precompute for each index i, two possibilities:

1. Starting with a positive sign (as in l = i), then the next terms alternate signs.
2. Starting with a negative sign (as if l = i+1, but perhaps not exactly). Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, since the sign depends on the parity of (k - l), perhaps we can model two scenarios for each position i:

- When the length of the interval starting at i is even or odd. But that might not directly help.

Wait, another idea. Let's create two transformed arrays:

For each i, compute s1[i] = d[i] * (1 if i is even else -1). But this seems arbitrary. Wait, no. Let me think.

Alternatively, for each possible starting position l, the sum for interval [l, r] can be represented as the sum of d[l] * 1 + d[l+1] * (-1) + d[l+2] * 1 + ... + d[r-1] * (-1)^( (r-1 - l) ). So the sign of each term depends on the position relative to l.

But this seems hard to model. However, perhaps we can find a way to represent the sum as a combination of two possible sequences, depending on whether l is even or odd, but perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, note that when l is even, the sign pattern might be different than when l is odd. Wait, but l can vary, and the parity of (k - l) depends on the parity of (k) and (l). Because (k - l) mod 2 is equal to (k mod 2) - (l mod 2), but modulo 2.

So, for example, if l is even (mod 2), then the parity of (k - l) is the same as the parity of k. So:

If l is even, then for each k, (-1)^(k - l) = (-1)^(k) * (-1)^(-l) = (-1)^k * (-1)^l. But (-1)^l is 1 if l is even. So for l even, the sign for k is (-1)^(k - l) = (-1)^k. But for l odd, (-1)^(k - l) = (-1)^{k - l} = (-1)^{k + (1 - l mod 2)} }.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's see:

Suppose we have two possible starting signs: when l is even, then the first term (k=l) is (-1)^0=1. Then the next term (k=l+1) is (-1)^1 = -1, etc. So the signs alternate starting with +1, regardless of l's parity. Wait, no. Wait, the starting point is always l. So (k - l) for k=l is 0, which is even. So the sign is 1. Then k=l+1: (k-l) is 1 → sign is -1, etc. So regardless of l's parity, the signs start with +1 and alternate. So the starting point's parity does not affect the sign pattern. So the parity of l doesn't directly affect the sign; the sign is determined by the position relative to l.

So for any l, the signs of the terms in the sum are +1, -1, +1, -1, etc., starting with +1.

Wait, but that's the same for all l. So the sign pattern for the terms in the sum is always alternating between +1 and -1, starting with +1, regardless of l. So, for example, the interval [l, r] has a sum that starts with d[l] * 1, then d[l+1] * (-1), then d[l+2] * 1, etc.

So the problem reduces to finding a subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) in the array d, such that when multiplied by the pattern [1, -1, 1, -1, ...], the sum is maximized. However, the subarray can start at any position l and end at position r-1 (since the interval [l, r] in the original array corresponds to elements l to r-1 in the d array). So the key is to find a subarray of the d array, but multiplied by this alternating sign pattern, and find the maximum sum.

But the challenge is that the sign pattern depends on where the subarray starts. For example, a subarray starting at position i in d would have signs [1, -1, 1, ...], whereas a subarray starting at position i+1 would have signs [-1, 1, -1, ...]. Wait, no. Because if the subarray starts at i, then the first element is multiplied by 1, the next by -1, etc. If the subarray starts at i+1, then the first element (d[i+1]) is multiplied by 1, then next by -1, etc. Wait, no. Wait, for the subarray starting at position k (d[k]), the signs are 1, -1, 1, -1... based on their position within the subarray. For example, the subarray d[k], d[k+1], d[k+2] would have signs 1, -1, 1. So the sign of each element in the subarray depends on its position relative to the start of the subarray.

So this is a bit different from the standard maximum subarray problem, because the sign of each element depends on the position within the subarray. So for a subarray of length m, the first element is multiplied by 1, the second by -1, and so on, alternating.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding a consecutive sequence of elements in the d array, and for each possible such consecutive sequence, compute the sum as follows: the first element *1, second *-1, third *1, etc. Then find the maximum such sum.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let's model this as two separate arrays:

For each position i in d, we can compute two possible values:

- s0[i] = d[i] * 1 if the position in the current subarray is even (starting from 0), so first element is +1.
- s1[i] = d[i] * -1 if the position in the current subarray is odd (starting from 0), so first element is -1.

Wait, but perhaps we can model two scenarios for each position i: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i where the length of the subarray is even or odd. Or perhaps, for each position, track the maximum sum if the next element's sign is +1 or -1.

Alternatively, we can model the problem by considering two cases when building the maximum subarray sum up to each index:

- The current subarray starts at an even position (within the subarray), leading to the next element being multiplied by -1.

Wait, maybe this is similar to the standard Kadane's algorithm, but with two states. Let's think:

For each i, we can track two values:

- max_even: the maximum sum for a subarray ending at i where the next element (if any) would be multiplied by -1. This would correspond to a subarray that has an even number of elements, so the next element (if added) would be in an odd position (so multiplied by -1).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's clarify:

Suppose we are building a subarray that starts at some position. For each position i, when we consider adding the element d[i], the sign it will have depends on whether the current subarray length (from the start) is even or odd. For example:

If the current subarray starts at position k, then the elements d[k], d[k+1], ..., d[i] would have signs 1, -1, 1, ... depending on their positions within the subarray. So the sign of d[i] is (-1)^(i - k).

But when we process d[i], we don't know where the subarray starts. So this complicates things.

Alternative approach: For each possible starting position k, compute the sum of d[k] * 1 + d[k+1] * (-1) + d[k+2] * 1 + ... + d[i] * (-1)^(i-k). The maximum of all these sums over all k and i >=k is the answer.

But computing this directly for all possible k and i would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

So we need a way to compute this in O(n) time.

Let's think of the sum S(k, i) as the sum of the subarray starting at k, ending at i, with the alternating signs. Then, the maximum S(k, i) over all possible k and i is the answer.

To compute S(k, i) efficiently, we can look for a recurrence relation. Let's see:

Suppose we know S(k, i-1). Then S(k, i) = S(k, i-1) + d[i] * (-1)^(i - k).

But the exponent (i -k) is equal to (i -k-1) +1. So (-1)^(i -k) = (-1) * (-1)^(i -k -1) ). Which means that each step alternates the sign from the previous term. So for example, if the last term in S(k, i-1) is multiplied by s, then the next term (d[i]) is multiplied by -s.

But how can we model this for all possible k?

Another idea: For each position i, track two values:

- The maximum sum for a subarray ending at i with an even length (number of terms)
- The maximum sum for a subarray ending at i with an odd length.

Wait, but the sign depends on the position in the subarray, not the length. For example, a subarray of length 1 is multiplied by 1, a subarray of length 2 is 1*1 + d[k+1]*-1, etc. So perhaps the parity of the subarray length affects the next term's sign.

Alternatively, think of each possible subarray as starting at some k and ending at i. The sign of the next term (i+1) would be (-1)^( (i+1) -k ) = (-1)^(i -k +1) = - (-1)^(i -k ). So each step alternates the sign of the next term.

But again, since the start k is unknown, this is tricky.

Alternative approach inspired by Kadane's algorithm:

Let's model two possibilities for each position i:

- The best subarray ending at i where the next element would be added with a positive sign (if we extend the subarray further).
- The best subarray ending at i where the next element would be added with a negative sign.

Wait, but the next element's sign depends on the length of the current subarray. For example, if the current subarray has even length, then adding another element would make it odd, but the sign for that new element depends on the position within the subarray. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the idea is to track for each position i the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at i and has a certain parity (even or odd number of elements). But I'm not sure.

Wait, here's another way to think about it. Let's consider two cases for each position i:

1. The maximum sum of a subarray that ends at i and has an even number of elements (so the next element, if added, would be multiplied by 1).
2. The maximum sum of a subarray that ends at i and has an odd number of elements (so the next element would be multiplied by -1).

But how does that work?

For example, if we have a subarray ending at i with an odd number of elements, then the next element (i+1) would be multiplied by -1. So the sum would be current sum + (-d[i+1]).

Alternatively, perhaps for each i, we track two variables:

- dp0[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i with an even length (so the next term would be added with a negative sign).
- dp1[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i with an odd length (so the next term would be added with a positive sign).

Wait, maybe the parity of the subarray length determines the sign of the next term. Let's see:

Suppose we have a subarray of length m. The next term added would be the (m+1)-th element. Since the signs alternate starting with +1 for the first element (position 0 in the subarray), the (m)th element (0-based) is multiplied by (-1)^m. So when the subarray has length m (elements 0 to m-1), the next element (m) would be multiplied by (-1)^m.

So for example, if the subarray has length 1 (elements 0), the next element (if added) would be multiplied by (-1)^1 = -1.

Wait, but the length of the subarray is m. So for the current subarray ending at i with length m, the next element (i+1) would be the (m)th element in the subarray (since indices start at 0). So the sign for that element is (-1)^m.

So the next sign is determined by the current length of the subarray.

But how can we model this in dynamic programming terms?

Let's define two states for each position i:

- even[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i with even length (m even). The next element (if any) would be added with sign (-1)^m = 1 (since m is even, (-1)^m is 1).
- odd[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i with odd length (m odd). The next element would be added with sign (-1)^m = -1 (since m is odd).

But how to compute even[i] and odd[i]?

For example, when we are at position i, we can consider extending a previous subarray or starting a new one.

Let's think:

For even[i], the subarray ending at i has even length. So the last element (i) is part of a even-length subarray. How can that happen?

If the previous subarray ending at i-1 has odd length, then adding d[i] to it would increase the length by 1 (making it even), and the sign of d[i] would be determined by the previous length. For example, the previous subarray had length m (odd), so the sign of d[i] would be (-1)^(m) (since the new position in the subarray is m). Since m is odd, (-1)^m is -1.

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let's think of transitions between even and odd.

Let's model the states as follows:

At each step i, we can compute two possible maximum sums:

- even[i]: the maximum sum for a subarray ending at i with even length. This can be obtained by adding d[i] multiplied by its sign (which depends on the previous state's parity).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think recursively.

At position i, we can decide whether to extend a previous subarray or start a new one.

For even[i], which is the maximum sum when the subarray ends at i and has even length. The even length could be 2,4, etc. But even length implies that the sum is built by adding a pair of elements (each contributing a term with opposite signs).

Alternatively, maybe the even and odd arrays track the maximum sum possible when the next element would be added with a positive or negative sign.

Another approach inspired by the solution for the problem of maximum subarray sum with alternating signs:

We can model two possibilities: when the next element is added with a positive sign, or a negative sign. Then, for each position, we can track the maximum sum that ends here when the next element would be added with the opposite sign.

So, let's define:

- pos[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i, where the next element (if any) would be added with a positive sign.
- neg[i]: the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i, where the next element would be added with a negative sign.

But how to compute pos and neg?

At position i, when we add d[i], the sign depends on the previous state. For example:

If the previous state was pos[i-1], then adding d[i] with a negative sign (since the next after pos would be neg). So neg[i] = max( pos[i-1] - d[i], ... )

Wait, perhaps:

pos[i] represents the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i where the next element would be added with a positive sign. This can happen in two ways:

1. The subarray starts at i, so the next element (i+1) would be added with a positive sign. But since the current subarray has length 1 (only d[i] multiplied by 1), the next element would be added with sign -1. Wait, this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps pos[i] represents the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i where the last element is added with a positive sign. Then, the next element would have to be added with a negative sign.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the current element's sign. For example:

If we are considering a subarray that ends at i, and the current element is added with a positive sign (so in the subarray, it's the first element, third, etc.), then the next element (i+1) would be added with a negative sign.

Alternatively, if the current element is added with a negative sign (second, fourth, etc.), then the next element would be added with a positive sign.

So, for each position i, pos[i] is the maximum sum of a subarray ending at i with the current element added with a positive sign. Similarly, neg[i] is the maximum sum with the current element added with a negative sign.

Then, for each i, the transitions would be:

pos[i] = max( d[i], neg[i-1] + d[i] )

neg[i] = max( -d[i], pos[i-1] - d[i] )

But wait, let's see:

At position i, to compute pos[i], which is the maximum sum where the current element is added with a positive sign. How can we get here?

Either:

- Start a new subarray at i, which is d[i] * 1 → pos[i] = d[i].

OR

- Extend a subarray that ended at i-1 with a negative sign. Because after a negative sign, the next element would be positive. So the previous subarray ended with a negative sign (neg[i-1]), and adding d[i] * 1 (since the next element is positive). So the total would be neg[i-1] + d[i].

So pos[i] = max( d[i], neg[i-1] + d[i] )

Similarly, for neg[i], which is the maximum sum where the current element is added with a negative sign.

This can be either:

- Starting a new subarray at i with a negative sign (d[i] * -1) → which is -d[i], but why would we do that? Because maybe the maximum is achieved by starting here.

OR

- Extending a subarray that ended at i-1 with a positive sign. Then, the next element (current i) is added with a negative sign. So the sum is pos[i-1] (the sum up to i-1, where the last element was added with positive sign) plus (-d[i]).

So neg[i] = max( -d[i], pos[i-1] - d[i] )

Then, for each i, we can compute pos[i] and neg[i], and keep track of the maximum overall value (since the maximum could be in either pos[i] or neg[i]).

But wait, this approach seems to model the maximum sum of a subarray where the elements are multiplied by alternating signs starting with either +1 or -1. Wait, no. Because in this model, pos[i] is the sum where the current element is added with +1, but the previous elements could have any starting sign. So the starting point could vary. But according to our problem, the starting point must be +1. So perhaps this approach is not directly applicable.

But let's test this with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

n=5, a = [1,4,2,3,1]

d is [3, 2, 1, 2]

Then, we need to compute pos and neg for each d[i].

Let's compute them step by step.

Initialize:

pos[0] = 3 (starting here as +3)
neg[0] = -3 (starting here as -3)
max_val = max(3, -3) → 3.

i=1 (d=2):

pos[1] = max(2, neg[0] + 2) → max(2, -3 + 2= -1) → 2.
neg[1] = max(-2, pos[0] -2) → max(-2, 3-2=1) → 1.
max_val is now max(3,2,1) →3.

i=2 (d=1):

pos[2] = max(1, neg[1] +1 → 1+1=2 → max(1, 2) → 2.
neg[2] = max(-1, pos[1] -1 → 2-1=1 → max(-1,1) →1.
max_val is now 3.

i=3 (d=2):

pos[3] = max(2, neg[2] +2 → 1+2=3 → max(2,3) →3.
neg[3] = max(-2, pos[2] -2 →2-2=0 →max(-2,0) →0.
max_val is now 3.

So the maximum is 3, which matches the sample. So this approach seems to work.

Another sample: input 2 is 4 elements [1,5,4,7], d is [4, 1, 3].

i=0 (d=4):

pos[0]=4, neg[0]=-4 → max is4.

i=1 (d=1):

pos[1] = max(1, -4+1=-3) →1.

neg[1] = max(-1, 4-1=3 →3).

max is 4,3 →4.

i=2 (d=3):

pos[2] = max(3, 3+3=6 →6).

neg[2] = max(-3, 1-3= -2 →-2).

max is 6.

Which matches the sample output of 6.

So this approach seems to work.

Wait, but according to this model, the maximum is the maximum of all pos[i] and neg[i]. But why does this work? Because it allows the subarrays to start anywhere, with any starting sign? But in our problem, the starting sign is always +1. However, according to this model, some subarrays could start with a negative sign. How does this fit?

Ah! Here's the thing: the problem's subarray's sign starts with +1. So the first element of the subarray is multiplied by +1. So the model we have here must enforce that the first element is multiplied by +1. But according to the current model, pos[i] represents the sum where the current element is added with a +1. So the first element in the subarray must be added with +1. So the maximum possible subarray sum in the problem would be the maximum among all pos[i] and neg[i], but perhaps not. Because in the model, a subarray can start with a negative sign, which is not allowed in the problem.

Wait, no. Because in the problem, the subarray starts with l and r. The first term is multiplied by +1. So the model's pos[i] is the maximum sum where the first term is multiplied by +1. Wait, no. Because the model's pos[i] allows for subarrays that start with a negative sign. For example, if a subarray starts at i and is added as a negative sign (which would be in the neg[i] array), but according to the problem, this is not allowed.

Wait, there's a contradiction here. The problem's subarrays must start with +1. But the model allows for subarrays that start with either +1 or -1. So how can this model be correct?

Ah! Because in the model, pos[i] represents the maximum sum for a subarray ending at i where the current element is added with +1, which could be part of a subarray that started earlier. For example, the current element could be the third element in the subarray (so multiplied by +1). However, according to the problem, the first element must be multiplied by +1. So the model's approach may include subarrays that don't start with +1, but the way the transitions are structured may prevent that.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: in the model, the transitions ensure that the first element of a subarray can be either +1 or -1. But according to the problem, the first element must be +1. So the model allows subarrays that start with -1, which are not allowed in the problem.

But according to the sample input 2, the maximum sum is 6, which is achieved by the entire array. The model's calculation gives pos[2] =6, which is the sum of 4*1 +1*-1 +3*1 =4-1+3=6. That's correct. So in this case, the model's pos[i] correctly captures the sum starting with +1.

But how does the model prevent considering subarrays that start with a negative sign? For example, a subarray that starts at i=1 with d[1] * -1. According to the model, neg[i=1] is 3. But in reality, such a subarray is not allowed in the problem. So why does the model work?

Ah, here's the insight: the model's pos[i] and neg[i] track the maximum sum for any possible subarray, regardless of where it starts. However, the problem's valid subarrays are those that start with +1. So the model's pos[i] is allowed, but the neg[i] represents a subarray that starts with -1 (invalid), but how does this affect the answer?

Wait, the model's pos[i] is the maximum sum when the current element is added with +1. But how can a subarray ending at i with +1 have started with -1? For example, if a subarray starts at position k, the first element is +1. So any subarray in the problem must start with +1. So how does the model account for that?

The key is that the model's transitions implicitly ensure that any subarray in pos[i] starts with +1. Because to get to pos[i], the path could have started at some k where the first element is added with +1, and then the signs alternate.

Wait, for example, when computing pos[i], the options are:

Either start a new subarray at i (so the sum is d[i] *1 → which is allowed) or extend a previous subarray that ended at i-1 with a negative sign (neg[i-1] + d[i] *1). But extending a previous subarray that ended with a negative sign implies that the new subarray started at an earlier position with +1. Because the previous subarray's neg[i-1] represents a sum where the last element was added with -1. So extending that subarray by adding d[i] with +1 would only be possible if the previous subarray started with +1 and alternated signs correctly.

So the model effectively allows for all possible valid subarrays (those starting with +1) and tracks the maximum sum. But how?

Let's see for the first sample:

In the first sample, the maximum is 3. According to the model, the maximum is found in pos[3] =3. That corresponds to the subarray starting at index 1 (d[1] is 2) and ending at index 3 (d[3] is 2). So the sum is 2*1 +1*-1 +2*1 = 2-1+2=3. So this is a valid subarray starting with +1.

But according to the model, the neg[i] could be higher than pos[i], but since the problem only allows subarrays that start with +1, the maximum sum should be the maximum among pos[i] entries. But in the first sample, neg[3] is 0, which is less than pos[3].

But in the second sample, the maximum is in pos[2] =6, which is correct.

What about another example. Suppose d = [5, 5], so the possible subarrays:

For [0,0]: sum 5*1 =5.

For [1,1]: sum 5*1=5.

For [0,1]: sum5*1 -5*1=0.

So the maximum is5. According to the model:

pos[0] =5, neg[0]=-5. max=5.

pos[1] = max(5, neg[0] +5 → -5+5=0 →5).

neg[1] = max(-5, pos[0] -5 →5-5=0 →0).

max is5.

Which is correct.

Another example: d = [3, -2].

Possible subarrays:

[0,0]:3*1=3.

[1,1]:-2*1= -2.

[0,1]:3*1 - (-2)*-1 →3*1 - 2*1=3-2=1.

So maximum is3.

According to model:

pos[0] =3, neg[0]=-3. max=3.

pos[1] =max(-2, neg[0] + (-2) →-3 + (-2) =-5 →-2).

neg[1] =max(2, pos[0] - (-2) →3 +2=5 →5).

max is max(3,5) →5. Which is wrong.

Wait, this is a problem. According to the model, the maximum would be5, but according to the actual problem's allowed subarrays, the maximum is3.

So what's happening here?

In this example, the model's neg[1] is5. How is that possible?

Let's see:

neg[i] represents the maximum sum where the current element is added with a negative sign. So for i=1, the current element is -2. So neg[1] is computed as max( (-2)*-1 = 2, pos[0] - (-2) →3 +2 =5 ). So neg[1] is5.

But according to the problem's definition, this would correspond to a subarray that starts at i=0, and ends at i=1. The sum would be 3*1 (from i=0) + (-2)* (-1) (since i=1 - l=0 →1-0=1 → (-1)^1 =-1. So the sign is -1 multiplied by d[1] → -2 * (-1) =2. So the sum is3 +2=5.

But according to the problem, this is a valid subarray [0, 2] (original array indices l=0 and r=2, but in terms of d, the subarray is [0,1]. So in the problem's terms, l=0 and r=2 (assuming 0-based) in the original array, which corresponds to the interval [0,1] in d.

So the sum is5, which is indeed a valid sum. But according to the problem's constraints, that's allowed.

Wait, but why does this example give a higher sum than the individual elements? Because the sum of the two terms is5, which is higher than3.

But according to the problem's description, the function f(l, r) for l=0 and r=2 (assuming 0-based original array) would be |a[0]-a[1]| *1 + |a[1]-a[2]| * (-1). So the terms are 3*1 + (-2)*-1 =3+2=5. Which is allowed. So the model's approach is correct, and the maximum in this case is5.

But earlier analysis suggested that the model's approach is correct. So perhaps the confusion is arising from a misunderstanding of the problem.

So in this example, the model's approach correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of5.

So the model's approach is correct. Therefore, the solution is to compute the maximum between all pos[i] and neg[i], but wait in the model, the maximum is the maximum of all pos[i] and neg[i] entries. But according to the problem's definition, the first term must be multiplied by1, so the subarrays considered in the problem's solution must start with a positive sign. However, in the model's approach, the neg[i] entries correspond to subarrays that start with a negative sign. But according to the problem, those subarrays are not allowed. So why does the model's approach work?

Wait, the model's approach allows for subarrays that start with a negative sign. But according to the problem's definition, those are invalid. So why does the model's approach give correct answers in the sample cases?

Ah, here's the key: the model's pos[i] and neg[i] track the maximum sum for subarrays that end at i, but the way the transitions are structured allows for subarrays that start anywhere. However, the problem's requirement is that the subarray starts with a positive sign (i.e., the first element is multiplied by1). But in the model, the way the transitions are set up, the maximum sum can only be achieved by subarrays that start with a positive sign. Let me explain:

When we start a new subarray at i, pos[i] is set to d[i] (since it's multiplied by1), which is allowed by the problem. The neg[i] is set to -d[i], which represents a subarray starting at i with a negative sign (which is not allowed). However, the model's transitions for neg[i] can only be built by extending previous pos[i-1] entries (which represent subarrays that start with a positive sign). So the neg[i] entries are not allowed to start with a negative sign, but the model's transitions may allow for that.

Wait, no. Let's look at the transitions again:

pos[i] = max( d[i], neg[i-1] + d[i] )

neg[i] = max( -d[i], pos[i-1] - d[i] )

So, for example, when computing neg[i], the -d[i] option corresponds to a subarray starting at i with a negative sign, which is invalid. However, such a subarray is not allowed in the problem. So why does the model include it?

But according to the problem statement, the subarrays must start with a positive sign. So the model's approach includes subarrays that start with a negative sign, which are invalid. This would imply that the model's approach is incorrect.

But in the earlier example where d = [3, -2], the model's maximum is5, which corresponds to a valid subarray starting with a positive sign. So how is this possible?

In that example, the maximum is5, which comes from the neg[1] entry. The neg[1] is computed as max( -d[1] (which is2), pos[0] -d[1] →3 - (-2) →5). So the maximum is5, which is pos[0] -d[1] =3+2=5. This represents the subarray starting at0, ending at1. The sum is3*1 + (-2)*-1=3+2=5. Which is allowed.

So the neg[i] entry in the model represents the sum of a subarray that ends at i, with the current element multiplied by-1. But how can this be a valid subarray under the problem's constraints? Because the first element must be multiplied by1.

Ah! Because the current element is part of a subarray that started with a positive sign and has an odd length.

For example, the subarray starts at0, has length2 (i=0 and i=1). The signs are1 for d[0], -1 for d[1]. The sum is3*1 + (-2)*-1=3+2=5. So the model's neg[i] entry captures the sum of such a subarray. So even though the current element is multiplied by-1, the subarray starts with a positive sign.

So the model's approach correctly captures all possible valid subarrays, even those with even or odd lengths. The neg[i] entries are allowed as long as they are part of a subarray that started with a positive sign.

Therefore, the model's approach is correct. The key is that the neg[i] entries are not subarrays that start with a negative sign. Instead, they represent subarrays that have an odd number of elements (so the last element is multiplied by-1), but the first element is multiplied by1.

So the model's approach correctly considers all possible valid subarrays. The maximum of all pos[i] and neg[i] values is the correct answer for the problem.

Therefore, the optimal solution is to compute the pos and neg arrays using dynamic programming, and take the maximum over all elements in pos and neg.

Now, the algorithm is O(n) time and O(1) space if we just track the previous pos and neg values, since we don't need to store the entire arrays.

So, the steps are:

1. Compute the differences array d where d[i] = abs(a[i] - a[i+1]) for i in 0 to n-2.

2. Initialize variables current_pos and current_neg. Initially, for the first element d[0], current_pos = d[0], current_neg = -d[0]. The maximum is initialized to current_pos.

3. Iterate from i=1 to len(d)-1:

   a. new_pos = max( d[i], current_neg + d[i] )

   b. new_neg = max( -d[i], current_pos - d[i] )

   c. Update max_val with the maximum between max_val, new_pos, new_neg.

   d. Set current_pos = new_pos, current_neg = new_neg.

4. After processing all elements, output max_val.

But wait, for the first element d[0], the current_neg is -d[0], which corresponds to a subarray starting at 0 with a negative sign. Which is invalid. However, when processing i=1, the new_pos for i=1 would consider current_neg (from i=0) + d[1]. So for example, if we take current_neg (which is -d[0]) + d[1], that would correspond to the sum (-d[0] + d[1]). But this would be the sum for a subarray starting at 0 and ending at 1, which has two elements. The sum is d[0]* (-1) + d[1]*1. But according to the problem's formula, the sum for [l=0, r=2] (assuming 0-based) would be d[0] *1 + d[1] * (-1). Which is different.

So there's a discrepancy here. Because the model's approach allows for a subarray that starts at 0 and ends at 1 (i=1) with sum (-d[0] + d[1]), which is not allowed in the problem. But according to the problem's formula, the sum would be d[0] *1 -d[1] *1.

So the model's approach may be considering some invalid subarrays. But why did it work in the previous examples?

Ah! Because the model's transitions are structured in a way that ensures that the subarrays start with a positive sign. Let's re-examine the transitions.

For i=0, pos[0] =d[0], which is valid (starts with +1). neg[0] =-d[0], which is invalid (starts with -1). However, when moving to i=1:

new_pos = max(d[1], neg[0] +d[1]).

But neg[0] is -d[0], which represents a subarray of length 1 starting at 0 with a negative sign. So adding d[1] to it would give a sum of (-d[0] +d[1]). But this would correspond to a subarray [0, 2] (in the original array) which has 3 elements (r = 0+2=2). The formula would be:

d[0] *1 (since i=0, l=0: 0-0=0 →1) → no. Wait, no. If l=0, then for the interval [0, 2], the sum is d[0] *1 (i=0) + d[1] * (-1) (i=1). So sum is d[0] -d[1]. But according to the model's new_pos calculation, this sum would be neg[0] (which is -d[0]) +d[1] →-d[0] +d[1], which is different from the correct sum d[0] -d[1].

So this indicates a problem. The model's approach is not considering the correct sign when extending from a subarray with a negative start.

But according to the problem's formula, when you have a subarray starting at l, each term's sign is (-1)^(i - l). So, for example, when extending a subarray from l to r, the signs alternate starting with +1.

But the model's approach allows for transitions that seem to compute incorrect signs. So why did the previous examples work?

Let's take the example where d = [3, -2]:

The model's approach computes for i=1:

new_pos = max(-2, (-3) + (-2) =-5 →-2). So new_pos is-2.

new_neg = max(2, 3 - (-2) =5 →5).

So the maximum is5.

But according to the problem's formula, the sum for the subarray [0,2] (l=0, r=2) is:

d[0] *1 + d[1] * (-1) →3*1 + (-2)*-1 =3+2=5.

But according to the model's neg[1] =5, which is supposed to be the sum with the current element multiplied by -1. But in reality, the current element (d[1] =-2) is multiplied by (-1) in the problem's sum. So the model's neg[1] corresponds to d[0] *1 +d[1] * (-1), which is exactly the problem's sum. So how does the model capture this?

Ah, the model's neg[i] represents the sum where the current element is added with a negative sign. But in this case, the current element is added with a negative sign, which is correct.

So the model's transitions are designed such that:

- When you extend a subarray that ends at i-1 with a positive sign (pos[i-1]), the next element (i) is added with a negative sign (so new_neg is pos[i-1] -d[i]).

- When you extend a subarray that ends at i-1 with a negative sign (neg[i-1]), the next element (i) is added with a positive sign (so new_pos is neg[i-1] +d[i]).

This way, the signs alternate correctly regardless of where the subarray started, as long as it started with a positive sign.

So, the model's approach is correct. Even though the neg[i] entries may represent subarrays that start with a positive sign but have an odd length, the sum is correctly calculated.

So the solution is to compute the pos and neg arrays as described, and take the maximum value encountered.

Now, to implement this:

First, compute the differences array d. Then, iterate through d, keeping track of current_pos and current_neg.

Initialize current_pos to d[0], current_neg to -d[0]. The maximum is initialized to current_pos.

Then, for each i from 1 to len(d)-1:

   new_pos = max( d[i], current_neg + d[i] )

   new_neg = max( -d[i], current_pos - d[i] )

   max_val = max(max_val, new_pos, new_neg)

   current_pos, current_neg = new_pos, new_neg

This should work.

Testing with the previous example where d = [3, -2]:

i=0:

current_pos=3, current_neg=-3 → max_val=3.

i=1:

new_pos = max(-2, (-3) + (-2) =-5 →-2). 

new_neg = max(2, 3 - (-2)=5 →5).

max_val = max(3, -2,5) →5.

So the model's approach works.

Another test case:

Sample Input 2:

n=4, a = [1,5,4,7]

d = [4,1,3].

i=0:

current_pos=4, current_neg=-4 → max_val=4.

i=1:

new_pos = max(1, -4 +1=-3 →1.

new_neg = max(-1, 4-1=3 →3.

max_val=4.

i=2:

new_pos = max(3, 3+3=6 →6.

new_neg = max(-3, 1-3=-2 →-2.

max_val=6.

So correct.

Therefore, the algorithm should work.

Now, implementing this in Python.

We need to:

- Read n.

- Read the array a.

- Compute d as the list of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

- If the length of d is zero (n=1), but according to constraints n>=2, so no.

- Initialize current_pos and current_neg.

- Iterate through d starting from index 1.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    if n < 2:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return

    d = [abs(a[i] - a[i+1]) for i in range(n-1)]

    if not d:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return

    max_val = d[0]  # initial current_pos is d[0], which is the first element's sum

    current_pos = d[0]
    current_neg = -d[0]

    for i in range(1, len(d)):
        # Compute new_pos and new_neg
        new_pos = max(d[i], current_neg + d[i])
        new_neg = max(-d[i], current_pos - d[i])
        current_max = max(new_pos, new_neg)
        if current_max > max_val:
            max_val = current_max
        current_pos, current_neg = new_pos, new_neg

    print(max_val, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output

```

Sample Input 2:

4
1 5 4 7

d = [4,1,3].

i=0: current_pos=4, current_neg=-4. max_val=4.

i=1 (d=1):

new_pos = max(1, -4+1 =-3 →1.

new_neg = max(-1,4-1=3 →3.

max_val remains4.

current_pos=1, current_neg=3.

i=2 (d=3):

new_pos = max(3, 3 +3=6 →6.

new_neg = max(-3,1-3 =-2 →-2.

max_val becomes6.

Output is6.

So the code works.

Another test case with d = [3,-2], which the code returns5.

So the code is correct.

The code runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) space, which is acceptable for n=1e5.

Thus, this is the optimal solution.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if n < 2:
    print(0)
    exit()

d = [abs(a[i] - a[i+1]) for i in range(n-1)]

current_pos = d[0]
current_neg = -d[0]
max_val = current_pos

for i in range(1, len(d)):
    new_pos = max(d[i], current_neg + d[i])
    new_neg = max(-d[i], current_pos - d[i])
    current_pos, current_neg = new_pos, new_neg
    if current_pos > max_val:
        max_val = current_pos
    if current_neg > max_val:
        max_val = current_neg

print(max_val)
```
