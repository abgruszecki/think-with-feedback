<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about a turtle that follows a sequence of commands. The commands are either 'F' for moving forward one unit or 'T' for turning around. We need to change exactly n commands (each change can be any number of flips, like changing a T to F multiple times in different steps) such that after all modifications, the turtle ends up as far as possible from the starting point. 

Hmm. The key here is that we can change exactly n commands, but each command can be altered multiple times. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "change exactly n commands from the list (one command can be changed several times)". Wait, does that mean that each modification counts as a change to a command, but the same command can be modified multiple times, and each such modification counts towards the total n? Or does it mean that exactly n distinct commands must be changed, regardless of how many times each is modified? 

Wait, the problem statement says: "change exactly n commands from the list (one command can be changed several times)". So, for example, if you have a command sequence of length 1, and n is 3, you can change that single command three times. Each time you flip it. So the total number of changes (i.e., the number of times you modify any command) is exactly n. So each change counts as one, regardless of which command it is. So each time you flip a command (from F to T or T to F), that's one change. So the total number of changes made must be exactly n. And each change can be to any command. So for example, flipping the first command three times would count as three changes.

So the problem is to perform exactly n flips (each flip is changing a single command's type) such that after all the commands are processed, the turtle's final position is as far as possible from the origin. And each flip can be applied to any command any number of times, but the total number of flips is exactly n.

So the initial approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Because the state depends on the current direction, the position, the current command index, and the number of flips used so far, and also the parity of the number of flips for each command (since flipping a command even times brings it back to the original state). But wait, since each flip can be done on any command any number of times, but the total is n, we need to track how many times each command was flipped. But that's impossible for a DP approach, because for 100 commands and n=50, the state would be too large. So we need a smarter way.

Wait, but each flip on a command is a toggle. For example, flipping a command once changes it from F to T or vice versa. Flipping it twice reverts it back. So the effective state of a command is the original state if it's flipped even times, and the opposite if it's flipped odd times. So, for each command, whether it's flipped an even or odd number of times is all that matters. Because each flip is a toggle. So the total number of flips is the sum over all commands of the number of flips applied to them. But the problem requires that the total number of flips is exactly n. So, for example, if we have a command that is flipped three times (which is odd), that's equivalent to flipping it once. The sum of all flips (each is the count of times each command was flipped) must equal exactly n. But since flipping a command even times is equivalent to not flipping it (since even flips cancel each other), the optimal way would be to either flip a command once (if it's odd) or zero times (if even), but in such a way that the total flips sum to n. However, since n can be up to 50, which is larger than the number of commands (up to 100), we might need to flip some commands multiple times.

Wait, but how? Because flipping a command twice is the same as not flipping it. So, if n is even, flipping a command twice (using two flips) would effectively do nothing. But the problem requires that the total number of flips is exactly n. So if we have to use exactly n flips, even if some of them are redundant, like flipping a command twice.

Wait, this complicates things. Because for example, if n is 3 and we have one command, we can flip it three times. That's equivalent to flipping it once. So the final state is the opposite of the original. But the number of flips used is 3. So the problem allows such a scenario.

So the key is that each flip counts as a single change, even if it's applied to the same command multiple times. So the total number of flips (i.e., the sum of the counts for each command) must equal exactly n. But the final state of each command depends on the parity of the number of flips applied to it.

Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each command whether to flip it an even or odd number of times, such that the sum of all flips (each count is at least 0) is exactly n, and the sum is n. Then, the maximum distance is computed based on the modified commands (each command is original XOR flipped_odd_times).

But since the sum can be any number up to n, but needs to be exactly n, but flipping a command even times contributes 0, 2, 4, etc. flips. Wait, no. For example, flipping a command 3 times (sum +=3) and flipping another command 1 time (sum +=1) gives total sum 4. So, the sum of the flips must equal exactly n. But how can the sum be equal to n? Because each flip is a single change, so for each command, the number of flips can be any non-negative integer. The total sum of all these is n.

But how do we model this? Because even if a command is flipped k times, the parity (k mod 2) determines the effective state. So the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of commands (each with parity 1, i.e., flipped an odd number of times) such that the sum of the flips (the total number of flips) is exactly n. But wait, that's not correct. Because even if a command is flipped 3 times (which is odd parity), that contributes 3 to the sum, which is an odd number. So the total sum of flips must be exactly n, but the parity of the sum is the same as the parity of n, since each flip contributes 1 to the sum. So, for example, if n is even, the sum of flips must be even.

But how can we model this in a way that allows us to compute the maximum possible distance? The problem is to find a way to flip the commands any number of times (total sum n) such that the modified commands (each being original XOR (number of flips is odd)) and compute the maximum possible distance.

But this seems very complex. Because the sum of the flips must be exactly n, and each flip is a single operation. So even if we flip a command multiple times, it's possible. For example, if n is 5, you can flip one command 5 times (equivalent to 1 flip, sum 5), or flip it 3 times and another 2 times (sum 5, equivalent to flipping each once). So in these cases, the effective flips (the parity) would be the same as flipping each once, but the sum of the flips (3 + 2 =5) equals n=5.

So the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of commands (each possibly with multiple flips) such that the sum of all the flips (each command's flip count) is exactly n. The effective state of each command is its original state if flipped even times, or flipped once (odd) times.

But how to model the sum of flips being exactly n. Because for example, if we have k commands in the subset (each with at least one flip), and the sum of their flip counts (each >=1) is exactly n. But since each flip count can be 1, 3, 5, etc. for a command in the subset (since even numbers of flips would have sum even, but if the total sum is n, which may be even or odd, depending on the problem), it's a bit tricky.

But perhaps the key insight is that the minimal number of flips to achieve a certain parity is 1 for each command (to flip once). But if we need to reach a sum of n, which may be larger than the number of commands, then we can flip some commands multiple times. For example, if we have n = 5 and there are 3 commands, each flipped once (sum 3) then we need 2 more flips. We can flip one of the commands two more times (sum becomes 3 + 2 =5), which is allowed. The parity of that command would be 3 (odd) flips, so it's effectively flipped once. So the sum is 5, which is correct.

So the total sum of flips is n. The parity of each command's flip count determines whether it's flipped. The sum of the flips must be exactly n, and the parity of the sum (n) must be the same as the sum of all the individual flips (since each flip is +1). That's always true.

So, the problem reduces to: select a subset of commands (each can be flipped an odd or even number of times), but the sum of all flips is exactly n, and the parity of the sum of flips is the same as n. Then, the maximum possible distance is to be found.

But how do we model this? Because even if we choose a subset S of commands to flip (each with an odd number of flips), the sum of their flip counts is n. But since each flip count is at least 1 (for commands in S) and possibly more, but the sum is exactly n. For example, suppose S has k commands. Each command in S is flipped 1 + 2a_i times (so that the total flips for each is 1+2a_i). The sum is sum (1+2a_i) for each i in S. Then sum = k + 2*sum a_i. And this sum must equal n. So n = k + 2*sum a_i. Which implies that (n -k) must be even and non-negative. Because 2*sum a_i is even and >=0.

So the minimal sum for S is k (when all a_i are 0), and each additional 2 flips (adding 2 to the sum) can be achieved by increasing a_i. So for any subset S, the possible sum is k + 2m, where m >=0. So the total sum must be equal to n, which implies that n >=k and (n -k) is even.

So to model this, for each possible subset S of commands, the minimal sum is the number of commands in S (each flipped once), and adding even numbers (flipping more times) to reach n. So for a subset S of size k, the sum can be k + 2m = n. Which is possible if and only if n >=k and (n -k) is even. So, if n and k have the same parity. Because (n -k) must be even, so n and k must have the same parity.

So for a subset S of size k, if k <=n and (n -k) is even, then the sum can be achieved by adding m = (n -k)/2 times 2 flips to the subset S. For example, for each m, you can add 2 flips to any command in S (since adding 2 flips doesn't change the parity of that command's flip count). So each such 2 flips contributes +2 to the sum.

So the key is that for any subset S of size k, if (n -k) is even and k <=n, then it's possible to achieve the sum n. So the problem is equivalent to choosing any subset S of commands (possibly empty) and then checking if (n - |S|) is non-negative and even. If yes, then the maximum distance can be computed by flipping the commands in S once (parity 1) and the rest even times (parity 0), but the sum of flips is |S| + 2m =n. So m is (n -k)/2, which must be >=0. So the subset size k can be any integer such that k <=n, k and n have the same parity, and k is between 0 and len(commands).

Wait, but the subset S can be any subset of commands (each command can be in or out). For each possible S, compute if (n - |S|) is even and non-negative. If so, then it's possible to reach a sum of n by flipping the commands in S 1 + 2m_i times, where m_i is non-negative integers, such that sum (1 + 2m_i) = n. Which can be done as long as (n - |S|) is even and >=0. Then, the modified command sequence is each command's original state XOR (if it's in S). Then, simulate the turtle's movement with this modified command list, and compute the distance. The maximum among all possible S that meet the conditions is the answer.

So the approach is to generate all possible subsets S of the commands, check for each subset S if |S| <=n and (n - |S|) is even and >=0. If so, then compute the resulting distance by flipping all commands in S (since each is flipped an odd number of times, their state is toggled), and then simulate the movement. The maximum of all such possible simulations is the answer.

But generating all subsets S is impossible for command lists up to 100 characters, since 2^100 is way too large. So this approach is not feasible.

So we need a smarter way.

Alternative approach: dynamic programming. Let's model the problem using dynamic programming, considering the current position, direction, the current command index, the number of flips used so far, and the parity of the number of flips for the current command. Wait, but that's a lot of states. Let's think.

Each command can be either in its original state or flipped. So for each command, the effective action is determined by the original command and the parity of the number of flips applied to it. For each position in the command list, we can track how many flips have been used so far, the current direction, the position (distance from origin), and for the current command, whether we have flipped it even or odd times. But even this might not be manageable for large command lists and n up to 50.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the state as:

- current command index (i)
- number of flips used (k)
- current direction (dir, 1 or -1)
- current position (pos, which can be up to 100 steps, so from -100 to 100)

But even with this, the state space could be manageable. Let's see: i can be up to 100, k up to 50, dir is 2 possibilities, pos can be up to 100. So 100 * 50 * 2 * 200 (since pos can be from -100 to 100) = 100 * 50 * 2 * 201 = around 2 million. Which is manageable.

Wait, but the position can actually be up to the number of commands. Each command can be 'F' in the modified list, leading to movement. For a command list of 100 'F's, after flipping some to 'T's (but we want to maximize the distance, so perhaps not). So the maximum possible position after processing all commands is 100 (if all are 'F's and direction remains forward). So pos can be up to 100. So the state space is 100 (i) * 51 (k up to 50, including 0 to 50) * 2 (dir) * 201 (pos from -100 to 100). So that's 100 * 51 * 2 * 201 = around 2,050,200. Which is manageable.

So the DP approach is feasible.

The transitions would be as follows:

At each step i, with current command, and for each possible state (k, dir, pos), we can decide whether to flip the current command (odd number of times) or not (even), but considering that each flip costs 1. However, since each flip can be done multiple times, but each flip adds to the total count, we have to model the total number of flips used. But how?

Wait, for each command, we can choose to flip it 0 times (cost 0) or 1 flip (cost 1). Because flipping it more than once (e.g., 2 times) is equivalent to 0 flips (cost 2). So for the DP, perhaps the decision for each command is whether to flip it an even or odd number of times. But the total cost (number of flips) is the sum of the number of flips for each command. However, flipping a command even times contributes 2m flips (m >=0), and flipping it odd times contributes 1 + 2m flips (m >=0). So the minimal cost for flipping it is 0 (even) or 1 (odd). But we can also choose to add 2m flips to any command, which would contribute 2m to the total flips. But the problem requires that the sum of all flips is exactly n.

But this seems difficult to model, because for each command, we can choose to flip it an even or odd number of times (each time contributing 2m or 1+2m flips) such that the total sum is exactly n.

Alternatively, the minimal number of flips to achieve a certain state (even or odd) is either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). But to reach the exact total of n flips, perhaps we can model the DP to track the parity of the remaining flips. Because after choosing some flips with even or odd counts, the remaining flips can be adjusted by adding even numbers (since adding 2 to any flip count contributes 0 to the parity of the total flips). So the key is that the parity of the total flips must be equal to the parity of n.

So for example, if we have used k flips (sum of the minimal flips for each command's parity), then the remaining flips (n -k) must be even, and non-negative. Because any additional flips (each contributing even numbers) can be added to reach the total n. So the DP can track the minimal flips (k) and then check if (n -k) is even and >=0. If so, then this is a possible scenario.

So here's the plan:

For each command, we can choose to flip it even or odd times. The minimal flips for even is 0 (don't flip), for odd is 1 (flip once). The sum of these minimal flips is the minimal possible sum to achieve the desired command states. Then, if the sum is s, and (n -s) must be even and >=0. Because any additional flips (each adding even numbers) can be made. For example, adding two flips to any command (cost 2, which is even) brings the total sum to s + 2m =n. So m must be (n -s)/2 >=0. So (n -s) must be even and >=0.

So the approach is to compute all possible scenarios where the sum of minimal flips (0 or 1 per command) is s, and (n -s) is even and >=0. Then, among all such scenarios, find the one that yields the maximum possible distance. The reason is that even if we have to add additional flips (each even), they don't affect the command's state (since even flips toggle the command back to original) but add to the total flips sum. So as long as (n -s) is even and non-negative, the scenario is valid.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible distance achievable by flipping any subset of commands (each 0 or 1 times) such that the sum of the flips (s) is <=n, s <=n, and (n -s) is even. Then, the maximum distance among all such subsets is the answer.

This is a crucial insight. Because now, instead of considering all possible flip counts (which is impossible), we can model the problem by considering each command as being flipped 0 or 1 times (since the parity is all that matters), and then check whether the sum of these 0/1 flips (s) plus 2m (m >=0) equals n. Which is possible if and only if s <=n and (n -s) is even.

So the steps are:

1. For all possible subsets of commands to flip (each flipped 0 or 1 times), compute the sum s of flips (number of commands in the subset).

2. For each such subset, if s <=n and (n -s) is even, then the scenario is valid, because we can add (n -s)/2 pairs of flips (each pair adds 2 flips and doesn't change the command's state) to reach the total n.

3. For each valid scenario, compute the distance after executing the modified commands.

4. The answer is the maximum of all these distances.

Now, the problem is to generate all possible subsets of commands (each command can be flipped 0 or 1 times) and compute their sum s. Then, for each s where s <=n and (n -s) is even, compute the distance. But with up to 100 commands, this is 2^100 subsets, which is impossible.

Therefore, the brute-force approach is not feasible. So we need a dynamic programming approach that can track the possible sums s and the maximum possible distance for each possible sum s, while also tracking the state of the turtle (direction and position) after processing each command.

So the dynamic programming state can be represented by:

- i: the current command index (from 0 to len(commands)-1)
- flips_used: the number of flips used so far (0 <= flips_used <=n)
- dir: current direction (1 for forward, -1 for backward)
- pos: current position (integer)
 
But the problem is that pos can be up to 100 (since each 'F' adds 1, and there are up to 100 commands). So the possible pos values are manageable.

The DP transition would process each command in order, and for each possible state, decide whether to flip the current command (cost 1 flip) or not (cost 0). Then, for each possibility, compute the next state.

But even this could be manageable. Let's see: len(commands) is up to 100. n is up to 50. So for each command, there are 100 * 50 * 2 (direction) * 200 (position from -100 to 100) possible states. Let's see:

100 (commands) * 50 (flips_used) * 2 (directions) * 201 (positions) = 100 *50 * 402 = 2,010,000. Which is manageable.

Wait, but flips_used can be up to 50. So for each command, the possible flips_used ranges from 0 to 50 (since flipping a command uses 0 or 1 flips). So for each step, the maximum flips_used can't exceed 50.

So the DP state is (i, flips_used, dir, pos). For each state, we process the current command. For each possible flip (0 or 1), we check if flips_used + flip <=n. Then, compute the new flips_used, and the new command action (original or flipped), then compute the new direction and position.

But the key is that for each possible state, we track the maximum possible position (absolute value) that can be achieved after processing up to command i with flips_used flips, current direction and position.

Wait, but for each state, we can track the maximum possible absolute position that can be achieved. Because even if we reach the same (i, flips_used, dir, pos) through different paths, but different maximum positions, we need to keep track of the maximum possible.

Alternatively, since we need to maximize the final absolute position, the DP can track for each (i, flips_used, dir, pos) the maximum possible |pos| at the end. But maybe it's better to track the current pos and dir, and after processing all commands, compute the absolute value.

So the DP will track the current state, and for each step, decide whether to flip the command or not. Then, after processing all commands, we check if the total flips used (s) in that path is such that (n -s) is even and >=0. If yes, then this path is a candidate for the maximum distance.

But how do we model the (n -s) being even and non-negative? Because for each path, after processing all commands, the s is the total flips used. Then, (n -s) must be even and >=0.

So the idea is to process all possible paths through the DP, and for each path, compute s (flips_used), and check whether (n -s) is even and >=0. If yes, then the path is valid. The maximum of all valid paths' final positions (absolute value) is the answer.

So the steps are:

- Initialize the DP with (i=0, flips_used=0, dir=1 (forward), pos=0).

- For each command in the list, process each possible state (i, flips_used, dir, pos).

- For each state, consider two possibilities: flip the current command or not.

- For each possibility:

   a. If flipping, flips_used increases by 1 (but must not exceed n).

   b. Compute the new command (original or flipped).

   c. Process the command: if 'F', move in current direction; if 'T', turn around (dir *= -1).

   d. Update the next state (i+1, new flips_used, new dir, new pos).

- After processing all commands, for each possible state (flips_used), compute if (n - flips_used) is even and >=0. If yes, then the final pos is valid, and the absolute value is a candidate for maximum.

So the DP needs to track all possible (flips_used, dir, pos) after processing all commands. Then, among all those where (n - flips_used) is even and >=0, find the maximum |pos|.

This approach should work.

Now, the implementation:

We can model the DP using a dictionary or a 3-dimensional array. But for Python, using a dictionary of dictionaries may be more efficient. However, considering the constraints, a 3-dimensional array for (flips_used, dir, pos) might be feasible. But since dir can be 1 or -1, and pos can be between -100 and 100, and flips_used up to 50, we can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries.

Alternatively, for each step, we can track the possible states using a dictionary that maps (dir, pos) to the minimal flips_used required to reach that state. Wait, but we need to track all possible flips_used up to n. So for each i, flips_used can be up to min(i, n), since each command can be flipped 0 or 1 times. Hmm, no. For example, for the first 5 commands, you can have up to 5 flips_used (if you flip all 5 commands), but if n is 50, then it's possible. So for each command, the flips_used can be up to min(n, current command index +1). So for the 100th command, flips_used can be up to 50 (if n is 50).

So the DP can be implemented with a 3D array for each step, where for each (flips_used, dir, pos), we track whether it's reachable. For each step, we can use a dictionary (or a set) to represent the possible states. Alternatively, for each step i, we can have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the possible (dir, pos) pairs for a given flips_used. But this might be memory-intensive.

Alternatively, for each step, we can represent the DP state as a dictionary where the keys are tuples (flips_used, dir, pos), and the value is the maximum possible absolute position so far (though I'm not sure if that's necessary). Or perhaps, since we need to track all possible (flips_used, dir, pos) states, and for each step, the possible states are derived from the previous states.

Let's outline the steps:

Initialize the DP for step 0 (before processing any commands) as flips_used=0, dir=1, pos=0.

For each command in the list (from 0 to len(commands)-1):

   For each possible state (flips_used, dir, pos) in the current DP:

      For the current command, consider two options: flip it (cost 1) or not (cost 0).

      For each option:

          new_flips = flips_used + flip (0 or 1). If new_flips >n, skip this option.

          modified_command = original_command if flip ==0 else (F if original was T, T if original was F).

          process the modified_command:

              if modified_command is 'F':

                  new_pos = pos + dir

                  new_dir = dir

              else: # 'T'

                  new_dir = -dir

                  new_pos = pos

              Then, add (new_flips, new_dir, new_pos) to the next DP state.

But since multiple paths can lead to the same (new_flips, new_dir, new_pos), but different positions, we need to track the maximum possible |pos|. Wait, but pos is part of the state. So each (new_flips, new_dir, new_pos) represents a unique state, and the pos is the current position. So even if two different paths reach the same state with the same pos, it's redundant. However, when processing the next command, the new_pos is part of the state, so different paths will be considered.

Therefore, the DP can track for each (flips_used, dir, pos) whether it's reachable. But since the order of processing commands is fixed (left to right), we can process each command step by step, updating the possible states.

So the code can be structured using a dictionary for each step. For example, using a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the possible states (flips_used, dir, pos) at step i.

But in Python, for each step, we can use a dictionary where the keys are tuples of (flips_used, dir, pos), and the value is a boolean indicating whether the state is reachable. However, for the problem, we don't need to track any value except the reachability. So we can use a set to track the reachable states.

But for the DP, perhaps using a list of sets for each possible flips_used, which maps to a dictionary of (dir, pos) pairs.

Alternatively, for each step, and each possible flips_used up to min(n, current step +1), track a dictionary of (dir, pos) pairs and the maximum possible position.

Wait, but the position can be positive or negative, and for the same (flips_used, dir), different positions can lead to different results. So perhaps we need to track all possible positions.

But considering that the maximum possible position after processing i commands is i+1 (if all are F and direction remains forward), and similarly for the minimum, the possible positions are manageable.

So the approach is:

Initialize a DP array where for each flips_used in 0..n, and for each direction (1, -1), and for each possible position, we track whether it's reachable.

But since the initial position is 0, direction is 1, and flips_used is 0.

At each step, for each possible state (flips_used, dir, pos), we consider flipping or not the current command, and generate new states.

The code can be implemented as follows:

We can represent the DP as a dictionary of dictionaries. For example, for each flips_used in 0..n, we have a dictionary that maps (dir, pos) to the maximum possible position. Or perhaps, for each step, we can have a 3-dimensional array (flips_used, dir, pos) where each entry is True if reachable. But for Python, using dictionaries is more efficient in terms of space.

Here's a possible code outline:

commands = input().strip()
n = int(input())

current = [ [ [ set() for _ in range(2) ] for __ in range(2) ] for ___ in range(n+1) ] 

Wait, perhaps using a dictionary that maps (flips_used, dir, pos) to True. So initially, before processing any commands, the state is (flips_used=0, dir=1, pos=0).

We can represent the DP as a set of tuples (flips_used, dir, pos). For each step, we process the current command and update the DP.

So the code would look something like this:

prev_dp = { (0, 1, 0) }

for cmd in commands:

    next_dp = set()

    for (flips, direction, pos) in prev_dp:

        # option 1: do not flip this command
        # process the command as is
        new_flips = flips
        if cmd == 'F':
            new_pos = pos + direction
            new_dir = direction
        else:
            new_pos = pos
            new_dir = -direction
        next_dp.add( (new_flips, new_dir, new_pos) )

        # option 2: flip this command (if possible)
        if flips < n:
            new_flips2 = flips + 1
            flipped_cmd = 'T' if cmd == 'F' else 'F'
            if flipped_cmd == 'F':
                new_pos2 = pos + direction
                new_dir2 = direction
            else:
                new_pos2 = pos
                new_dir2 = -direction
            next_dp.add( (new_flips2, new_dir2, new_pos2) )

    prev_dp = next_dp

# After processing all commands, check all possible states in prev_dp
max_distance = 0

for (s, d, p) in prev_dp:

    remaining = n - s

    if remaining >=0 and remaining % 2 ==0:

        current_distance = abs(p)

        if current_distance > max_distance:

            max_distance = current_distance

print(max_distance)

Wait, but this code is not correct. Because in the next_dp, multiple entries may have the same (flips, dir, pos). For example, two different paths could reach the same state. But since we are using a set, these duplicates are automatically handled. However, the code above will miss some possibilities. For example, if a state (s, d, p) is added multiple times via different paths, but in reality, all such paths are represented once in the set. However, the code is correct in the sense that the set captures all possible (s, d, p) states after each step.

But wait, the problem is that after processing all commands, the code checks for all (s, d, p) in the final DP. For each such state, s is the total flips used. Then, remaining = n -s must be >=0 and even. So those states are valid, and the maximum |p| among them is the answer.

This should work.

Let's test this code with the first example:

Input: FT, n=1.

Commands are 'F' followed by 'T'.

The code initializes prev_dp with (0, 1, 0).

Processing first command 'F':

For the state (0, 1, 0):

Option 1: do not flip. The command is 'F', so new_pos is 0 +1=1, direction remains 1. So add (0,1,1) to next_dp.

Option 2: flip (since flips is 0 <1). New flips is 1. The flipped command is 'T'. So direction becomes -1. new_pos is 0. So add (1, -1, 0) to next_dp.

prev_dp becomes { (0,1,1), (1,-1,0) }.

Processing second command 'T':

First, take each state in prev_dp.

First state: (0,1,1).

Option 1: do not flip. Command is 'T'. So direction becomes -1. pos remains 1. So new state is (0, -1, 1).

Option 2: flip (0 <1). New flips is 0+1=1. Flipped command becomes 'F'. So move in current direction (1) to 1+1=2. direction remains 1. So new state is (1, 1, 2).

Second state: (1,-1,0).

Option 1: do not flip. Command is 'T'. Direction becomes 1. pos remains 0. So state (1, 1, 0).

Option 2: flip (1 <1? No. So not allowed.)

So next_dp after processing second command is:

{(0, -1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 0)}.

Now, after processing all commands, check each state:

For (0, -1, 1):

s =0. remaining =1-0=1, which is odd. Not valid.

For (1, 1, 2):

s=1. remaining=1-1=0. Even and >=0. So current distance is 2. Which is the maximum.

For (1, 1, 0):

s=1. remaining 0. distance is 0. So maximum is 2.

Which matches the first example.

So this code works for the first example.

The second example: FFFTFFF, n=2.

Original command is 'FFFTFFF' (7 commands).

After processing, the code should find a maximum of 6.

But let's not go through the entire simulation here.

Thus, the code seems to handle the cases correctly.

Now, the code uses a set to track the states. However, in Python, sets of tuples can be slow for large numbers of states. Therefore, to optimize, perhaps using a dictionary where the key is (flips_used, direction, pos) and the value is whether the state is present. Or using a defaultdict to track the possible states. However, the code as written should work, but may need optimizations for larger command lengths and n up to 50.

But the code may have a problem with the number of states. For example, for 100 commands, each step could generate O(n * possible_pos) states. The possible_pos can be up to 100 (if all are F's). So for each step, the number of states is up to (n+1) * 2 (directions) * 201 (positions) = 51 * 2 * 201 = 20,502 per step. For 100 steps, that's 2,050,200 states. Which should be manageable in Python, especially since the code is using a set and tuples, which are hashable.

But perhaps the code can be optimized by using a dictionary per step that tracks for each (flips_used, direction) the maximum and minimum possible positions, thereby reducing the number of states. Because for the same (flips_used, direction), if there are multiple pos values, but some are larger than others, the smaller ones can be discarded if they are not going to contribute to the maximum distance.

For example, if for a given (flips_used, direction), we have positions 3 and 5. The maximum possible distance in the end would be better if we have 5. So storing only the maximum and minimum positions for each (flips_used, direction) could reduce the state space.

This optimization would greatly reduce the number of states. Because for each (flips_used, direction), instead of tracking all possible pos, we track the maximum and minimum possible pos. Since the maximum possible pos increases by 1 each step (if moving forward) and the direction can change. But for each step, the maximum pos for a certain (flips_used, direction) is the maximum of the previous max plus 1 (if current command is F) or remains the same (if T). But this depends on the command and whether it's flipped.

This is more complex, but perhaps manageable. Let's think:

For each step, and each (flips_used, direction), track the maximum and minimum possible pos.

At each step, when processing a command, for each possible (flips_used, direction) in the previous step, we can compute the new pos for both flipping and not flipping.

For example, for each (flips_used, direction) in the previous step, and for their max and min pos:

Option 1: do not flip the command. The command is processed as is. For each possible pos in [min_pos, max_pos], process the command. But tracking the new max and min for the new (flips_used, new_dir).

Option 2: flip the command (if flips_used <n). The new command is processed. Again, track the new max and min for (flips_used+1, new_dir).

But how to track the possible pos ranges. For example, if the previous step's (flips_used, direction) has a min_pos and max_pos, then for the current command, processing it without flipping would generate a new range of pos.

For instance, if the command is 'F', and direction is 1, then the new pos would be previous pos +1. So the new max and min are previous max +1 and previous min +1, respectively. For direction -1, new pos is previous pos -1.

If the command is 'T', the new direction is reversed. The pos remains the same, but the direction flips.

But when flipping the command, the command's type changes. So if the original command is 'F', flipping makes it 'T' and vice versa.

This approach would track for each (flips_used, direction) the min and max pos. This can reduce the number of states from O(n * 2 * 200) to O(n * 2) per step.

Let's formalize this:

For each step i, and for each possible (flips_used, direction), we track the minimum and maximum possible positions. So the state is (flips_used, direction) → (min_pos, max_pos).

At each step, processing the current command (original or flipped):

For each state (s, d) with min_p and max_p:

   Option 1: do not flip. Process the command:

      if command is 'F':

          new_d = d

          new_pos ranges from min_p +d to max_p +d

          new_min = min_p +d

          new_max = max_p +d

      else: 'T'

          new_d = -d

          new_pos ranges from min_p to max_p

          new_min = min_p

          new_max = max_p

      So the new state is (s, new_d), with new_min and new_max.

   Option 2: flip (if s <n). Process the flipped command:

      new_s = s+1

      flipped_cmd is 'T' if original was 'F', 'F' if original was 'T'.

      if flipped_cmd is 'F':

          new_d = d

          new_pos ranges from min_p +d to max_p +d

          new_min = min_p +d

          new_max = max_p +d

      else: 'T'

          new_d = -d

          new_pos ranges from min_p to max_p

          new_min = min_p

          new_max = max_p

      The new state is (new_s, new_d), with new_min and new_max.

Then, for each new state (s, d), we merge the min and max positions. For example, if there are two entries for (s, d) from different paths, we take the overall min and max.

This approach significantly reduces the number of states, as each (s, d) is represented once, with the possible range of positions. The maximum possible distance for a given (s, d) is the maximum of the absolute values of min and max.

At the end, for each state (s, d) in the final step, we compute the maximum absolute value between min and max. Then, check if (n -s) is even and >=0. If so, include this in the possible maximum.

This optimization would allow handling up to 100 commands and n=50 within the time and memory constraints.

So the code would be structured as follows:

- Use a dictionary to track the current states. Each key is a tuple (flips_used, direction). The value is a tuple (min_pos, max_pos).

- Initialize the initial state as (0, 1) → (0, 0).

- For each command in the command list:

   - Create a new dictionary for the next states.

   - For each state (s, d) in the current states:

      - Get the current min_p and max_p.

      - Process the command without flipping:

         Compute new command's effect.

         Update new_d and compute new_min and new_max.

         Update the next_state dictionary for (s, new_d) by merging the min and max.

      - Process the command with flipping (if s <n):

         Compute new_s = s+1.

         Compute the flipped command's effect.

         Update new_d and compute new_min and new_max.

         Update the next_state dictionary for (new_s, new_d) by merging the min and max.

   - Replace the current states with the next states.

- After processing all commands:

   For each state (s, d) in the current states:

      Check if (n -s) is even and >=0.

      If yes, compute the maximum possible distance from the min_pos and max_pos.

      Keep track of the overall maximum distance.

Thus, this approach should work and be efficient.

Let's try to implement this.

Code steps:

Initialize current_states as a dictionary. Initially, current_states = { (0, 1): (0, 0) }.

For each cmd in commands:

   next_states = {}

   for (s, d) in current_states:

       (min_p, max_p) = current_states[(s, d)]

       # process option 1: do not flip

       if cmd == 'F':

           new_d = d

           new_min = min_p + d

           new_max = max_p + d

       else:

           new_d = -d

           new_min = min_p

           new_max = max_p

       key = (s, new_d)

       if key not in next_states:

           next_states[key] = (new_min, new_max)

       else:

           existing_min, existing_max = next_states[key]

           new_entry = (min(existing_min, new_min), max(existing_max, new_max))

           next_states[key] = new_entry

       # process option 2: flip, if s <n

       if s <n:

           new_s = s + 1

           flipped_cmd = 'T' if cmd == 'F' else 'F'

           if flipped_cmd == 'F':

               new_d_flipped = d

               new_min_flipped = min_p + d

               new_max_flipped = max_p + d

           else:

               new_d_flipped = -d

               new_min_flipped = min_p

               new_max_flipped = max_p

           key_flipped = (new_s, new_d_flipped)

           if key_flipped not in next_states:

               next_states[key_flipped] = (new_min_flipped, new_max_flipped)

           else:

               existing_min, existing_max = next_states[key_flipped]

               new_entry_min = min(existing_min, new_min_flipped)

               new_entry_max = max(existing_max, new_max_flipped)

               next_states[key_flipped] = (new_entry_min, new_entry_max)

   current_states = next_states

After processing all commands:

max_distance = 0

for (s, d) in current_states:

   if (n -s) >=0 and (n -s) %2 ==0:

       min_p, max_p = current_states[(s, d)]

       current_max = max(abs(min_p), abs(max_p))

       if current_max > max_distance:

           max_distance = current_max

print(max_distance)

Another test case:

Input: FFFTFFF, n=2.

The code should output 6. The optimal solution involves changing two commands.

But regardless, the code should compute the correct result.

Thus, this approach should work.

Now, the code needs to be implemented in Python, making sure to handle the merging of min and max for each state.

Now, let's write the code.
