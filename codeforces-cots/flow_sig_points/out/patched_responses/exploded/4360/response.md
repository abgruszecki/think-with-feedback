<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

So, the problem is about maximizing the total damage of n creatures by using up to a spells of type 1 (doubling health) and up to b spells of type 2 (set damage equal to health). Each spell can be applied to any creature multiple times, but the total of type 1 can't exceed a, and type 2 can't exceed b.

The goal is to find the maximum possible total damage after optimally using these spells.

First, let's understand the spells. Type 2 spell directly sets the damage of a creature to its current health. So for any creature, applying a type 2 spell once is sufficient because applying it again when the health hasn't changed (since type 2 doesn't modify health) would have no effect. However, if after a type 1 spell (which increases health), applying type 2 again would update the damage. So the order of applying type 1 and type 2 spells matters.

But the constraints are that a is up to 20, which is small, and b up to 2e5. Wait, but n can be up to 2e5 as well. So for each creature, we might need to decide whether to apply type 2 spells and type 1 spells in some way.

But since each type 2 spell can be applied on any creature, but the total is up to b. So the problem is to select which creatures to apply type 2 spells, and how many type 1 spells to apply to each, in order to maximize the total damage.

Hmm. Let's think about each creature's optimal path.

For a creature with initial hp and dmg, the best possible scenario is to apply some number of type 1 spells (doubling hp) followed by a type 2 spell. Because each type 1 spell increases hp exponentially, but the type 2 spell then sets the dmg to hp. So for a creature, the maximum possible dmg we can get is (hp * 2^k) where k is the number of type 1 spells used on it, but only if we also apply a type 2 spell. Otherwise, if we don't apply a type 2 spell, the dmg remains as the initial dmgi.

Wait, but the creature's original dmg could be higher than hp. So for each creature, we need to decide whether applying type 2 is beneficial. For example, if a creature's original dmg is higher than its hp, then even applying a type 2 spell would decrease the damage. So in that case, we shouldn't apply any spells on it. But if after some type 1 spells, the hp becomes higher than the original dmg, then applying type 2 would be beneficial.

So the approach for each creature is to consider two possibilities: either apply some number of type 1 spells and then a type 2 spell, or leave it as is (possibly applying some type 2 spells but that's only useful if the original hp is better than dmg).

Wait, but applying a type 2 spell without any type 1 spells could be better. For example, if a creature's hp is 10, dmg is 5. Then applying a type 2 spell (costs 1 of b) would give dmg 10, which is better.

So for each creature, the optimal choice is to decide whether to apply 0 or more type 1 spells followed by a type 2 spell, or not apply any type 2 spell. Because once you apply a type 2 spell, any further type 2 spells on that creature (without changing hp) would do nothing. So for each creature, applying type 2 at most once is sufficient. But maybe you can apply multiple type 2 spells if you also apply type 1 in between.

But given that a is up to 20, maybe it's possible to apply a few type 1 spells and then a type 2. For example, apply k type 1 spells (cost k a's) and then a type 2 (cost 1 b), leading to a total gain of (hp * 2^k) - original dmg. If this gain is positive, then it's worth doing.

But since a is limited (up to 20), and each creature can have up to a type 1 spells, but the total a is up to 20, perhaps the optimal is to choose for each possible k (from 0 to a), which k's to allocate to which creatures to maximize the total gain.

But since a is small (up to 20), perhaps we can model this with some DP or greedy approach.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

1. For each creature, compute the best possible gain that can be achieved by applying some number of type 1 spells (k) followed by a type 2 spell. This will cost k type 1's and 1 type 2's. The gain is (hp*2^k) - max(dmg, hp). Wait, no: because if the original dmg is already higher than hp, then applying a type 2 spell (without any type 1) would not be beneficial. But if we apply some type 1's first, then the hp increases, and then applying type 2 could be better.

Wait, for a creature, the initial damage is dmgi. Let's say we don't apply any type 2 spells. Then the damage remains dmgi. But if we apply some type 1 spells (k times), then the hp becomes hp_i * 2^k, but the damage remains dmgi unless a type 2 is applied. So the only way to get the damage to be hp_i * 2^k is to apply a type 2 spell.

So for each creature, the optimal choice is between:

a) Do not apply any type 2 spells: the damage is dmgi.

b) Apply some k type 1 spells (k >=0, up to a) and then a type 2 spell. The damage becomes hp_i * 2^k. But this costs k type 1's and 1 type 2.

But since a is up to 20, the maximum possible k per creature is up to 20. But applying this for all creatures would be expensive. So how do we select which creatures to spend type 1 and type 2 spells on to maximize the total damage?

Moreover, the type 2 spells are limited by b. So even if applying a type 2 spell gives a gain, but we have a limited b, we need to select the top b gains.

So here's a possible strategy:

Compute for each creature the maximum possible gain (hp_i * 2^k - original_damage) for all possible k (including 0). Then select the best combinations of these gains, considering the constraints a and b.

But this seems computationally heavy. Let's think step by step.

First, the base total damage is the sum of all original dmgi. Then, for each possible use of a type 2 spell (possibly with type 1's), we can gain some delta. The problem is to select a subset of these deltas (each requiring some a's and 1 b's) such that the sum of a's used is <= a, and the number of b's used is <= b, and the sum of deltas is maximized.

But given that a is small (20), perhaps we can model this as follows:

- For each creature, compute all possible possible (k, gain) pairs where gain is (hp_i * 2^k) - max(dmgi, current best). Wait, but if applying type 2 spell after k type 1's, the gain is (hp_i * 2^k) - original_damage, but only if this is positive. Otherwise, it's better not to apply the spell.

But for each creature, the maximum possible gain is max_{k=0 to a} (hp_i * 2^k - dmgi), but this is only possible if we spend k type 1's and 1 type 2. However, since the original dmgi could be higher than hp_i*2^k, the gain could be negative. So for each creature, the best possible gain is (max(0, max_{k=0 to a} (hp_i * 2^k) - dmgi)).

Wait, but the initial damage is dmgi. If we apply a type 2 spell (without any type 1's), then the damage becomes hp_i. So the gain would be (hp_i - dmgi) if hp_i > dmgi. If we apply k type 1's and a type 2, the damage becomes hp_i*2^k, so the gain is (hp_i*2^k - dmgi).

But if the original dmgi is already higher than hp_i*2^k, then applying this is worse. So for each creature, the best possible gain is the maximum between 0 (not using any spells) and the maximum of (hp_i*2^k - dmgi) for k from 0 to a.

But each such gain requires using k type 1's and 1 type 2. So, for each creature, we can compute the maximum possible gain and the required k for that gain.

But how do we select which creatures to apply these gains, considering that the total a and b are limited.

Wait, but the problem is that each gain for a creature can be considered as a "option" that takes k type 1's and 1 type 2, and gives a delta. But we can choose to take this option or not. However, each creature can have multiple options (different k's). So for all creatures, we need to find a subset of options where sum of k's <= a, sum of type 2's (each option takes 1) <= b, and the sum of deltas is maximized.

But even this seems computationally challenging, especially for large n and a up to 20.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each creature the best possible gain (maximum possible (hp*2^k - dmg) for k in 0..a), and the required k. Then, the problem becomes selecting a subset of these options such that the sum of k's is <=a, the number of options (since each option uses 1 type 2) is <=b, and the sum of gains is maximized.

This seems manageable because a is small.

But how?

Hmm. Let's think about it. For each creature, we can compute the best possible gain (the maximum of (hp*2^k - (original dmg)) for k from 0 to a, and the corresponding k required. Then, the gain is (hp*2^k - original dmg) if that is positive. Otherwise, it's better not to apply any spells (gain is zero).

So for each creature, the maximum possible gain is max(0, max_{k=0..a} (hp_i*2^k - dmg_i)). Let's call this gain_i, and the corresponding k_i.

But if the gain_i is positive, then selecting this gain_i requires using k_i type 1's and 1 type 2.

So the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of the creatures (with gain_i >0) such that:

sum of k_i for S <=a

|S| <=b

sum of gain_i is maximized.

Because adding a creature to S gives a gain of gain_i, but uses up k_i type 1's and 1 type 2.

So the problem is to select a subset of the gain_i's (each with their own k_i and requiring 1 type 2), such that the sum of k_i <= a, the number of selected items <=b, and the sum is maximized.

This is a classic knapsack problem, but with two constraints (sum of k_i <=a and number of items <=b). However, the problem is that the number of items (n) can be up to 2e5, which is way too big for any O(n*a*b) solution.

But since a is up to 20 and b up to 2e5, we need a smarter approach.

Wait, but the constraints here are:

- The total number of type 2 spells used (number of selected items) can't exceed b.

- The total k_i (sum of the type 1 spells used) can't exceed a.

So the problem is a 2-dimensional knapsack. But with n up to 2e5, this is impossible with standard DP approaches.

Alternative approach: since a is small (up to 20), and the sum of k_i must be <=a, maybe we can find for each possible a_used (from 0 to a), the maximum gain possible using a_used type 1's and up to b type 2's.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the key insight is that the optimal selection will involve choosing the best possible gain_i's that have the highest (gain_i) per (k_i + 1), but this isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, here's a plan:

1. For each creature, compute the best possible gain_i and the required k_i. If the gain_i is <=0, we ignore this creature. Otherwise, we have a possible option to include it.

2. Now, collect all these options (gain_i, k_i). Then, we need to select a subset of these options such that the sum of k_i <= a, the number of options selected <=b, and the sum of gains is maximized.

3. But with n up to 2e5, even this is challenging. So we need to find a way to select the top options that maximize the sum, given the constraints.

But since a is small, maybe we can model the problem as follows:

For each possible a_used (from 0 to a), we can collect the best possible gains where the sum of k_i is exactly a_used. Then, for each a_used, we can take the top m options (up to b), such that the sum of gains is maximized.

Wait, but a_used is the sum of k_i for the selected options. And for each a_used, the number of selected options (each using 1 type 2) can't exceed b. So for each possible a_used (from 0 to a), we can compute the maximum sum of gains by selecting up to min(b, b_total) options, where the sum of k_i is exactly a_used. Then, the answer would be the maximum over all a_used (0<=a_used <=a) and the sum of up to min(b, remaining) options.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, here's a way:

Sort all the possible options (gain_i, k_i) in descending order of gain_i. Then, for each possible a_used (from 0 to a), and for each possible number of selected options (from 0 to min(b, ...)), track the maximum sum of gains.

But this seems computationally intensive.

Wait, another idea: the optimal solution would take the top x options (sorted by gain_i) that can fit within a and b. But since a is small (up to 20), perhaps we can try all possible allocations of a_used (the total type 1's used) and see how much of the remaining a_used can be filled.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

- Precompute all possible options (gain_i, k_i) for each creature where gain_i is positive.

- Sort these options in descending order of gain_i.

- Then, for each possible a_used from 0 to a:

   - Select the maximum number of options (up to b) such that the sum of their k_i is <=a_used, and we can take as many as possible up to b.

   - The maximum gain would be the sum of the top (b) options, but ensuring that the sum of their k_i is <=a_used.

Wait, no. Because the sum of k_i for the top m options (m <=b) must be <=a_used. So for each a_used, the maximum possible sum is the sum of the top m options with sum of k_i <=a_used and m <=b.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, for each a_used, we can compute the maximum sum of gains where the sum of k_i is <=a_used and the number of options is <=b.

But how to do that quickly?

Hmm. Let's think. Since the options are sorted in descending order of gain, the best possible sum for a certain a_used and m (number of options) is the sum of the first m options, provided their sum of k_i <=a_used.

But since a_used can be up to 20, and m up to min(b, n), this might be manageable.

Wait, here's the plan:

- For each a_used (from 0 to a), and for each possible m (number of options selected, up to min(b, total options)), compute the sum of the first m options, but check if their sum of k_i <= a_used. The maximum sum for a_used is the maximum sum where sum of k_i <=a_used and m <=b.

But this seems like O(a * n) time, which is acceptable since a is 20 and n is 2e5.

Wait, but how?

Let me explain:

1. Sort all options in descending order of gain_i. So the first option is the best possible gain.

2. Precompute a prefix sum array of the gains, and a prefix sum array of the k_i's.

3. For each a_used (from 0 to a), find the maximum m such that sum_k[m] <=a_used and m <=b. The sum_gain[m] is the sum of the first m options.

4. Take the maximum over all a_used of sum_gain[m] + (remaining a_used - sum_k[m] ? No, because a_used is the total allowed sum of k_i. So for each a_used, we can have any number of options up to b, but their k_i sum must be <=a_used.

But how to compute for each a_used the maximum possible sum_gain where sum_k of the first m options is <=a_used and m <=b.

This can be done by precomputing the prefix sums of the sorted list. Then, for each a_used, the maximum m is the largest m where the sum_k of first m options is <=a_used and m <=b. The sum_gain for that m is the maximum possible.

Additionally, we can have m up to b. So for each a_used, we can iterate m from 0 to min(b, len(options)), and compute the maximum sum_gain where sum_k of first m options <= a_used.

But with a_upto 20 and len(options) up to 2e5, this could be O(a * len(options)) which is 20 * 2e5 = 4e6 operations, which is manageable.

But how to compute the maximum m for each a_used?

Alternative approach: for each a_used, find the maximum m such that the sum of k_i of the first m elements is <=a_used and m <=b.

But how to compute this quickly.

We can precompute the prefix sum of the k_i's. Then, for each a_used, find the maximum m where prefix_k[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

This is equivalent to finding the largest m <=b such that prefix_k[m] <=a_used. Because the prefix_k is non-decreasing (since the options are sorted by gain_i in descending order, and the k_i could be anything). Wait, but sum of k_i's may not be non-decreasing. For example, if the first option has k_i=5, the next has k_i=3, etc. So the prefix sum may increase, but not necessarily in a monotonic way.

Wait, no. The options are sorted in descending order of gain_i. So the first option is the highest gain, the second next, etc. But the sum of k_i's for the first m options could be anything, since the order is based on gain_i. So the prefix sum of the k_i's is not necessarily non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Thus, for a given a_used, we cannot binary search the prefix sum. So for each a_used, we need to iterate through the sorted list of options, accumulating sum_k and sum_gain until sum_k exceeds a_used or m exceeds b.

Wait, but since the list is sorted in descending order of gain_i, the best possible sum is achieved by taking the first m options (since they have the highest gains). So even if some of their k_i's are large, but others are small, the sum of gains is maximized by taking the first m options.

So, for a_used, we can loop through the sorted options, keeping track of the sum of k_i and the sum of gain, and stop when the sum of k_i exceeds a_used, or m exceeds b.

But for each a_used (0 to a), we need to process the sorted list once. Since a is up to 20, and for each a_used, processing the list up to min(b, len(options)) steps, the total time would be O(a * len(options)) = 20 * 2e5 = 4e6 steps, which is acceptable.

So here's the plan:

1. For each creature, compute the maximum possible gain (gain_i) and the corresponding k_i (number of type 1 spells used). If gain_i is negative, ignore the creature. Otherwise, add (gain_i, k_i) to a list.

2. Sort this list in descending order of gain_i.

3. Precompute the prefix sums of gain and k for this sorted list.

   prefix_gain[m] = sum of first m gains.

   prefix_k[m] = sum of first m k_i's.

4. For each possible a_used (0 <= a_used <=a), find the maximum m where prefix_k[m] <=a_used and m <=b. The corresponding sum is prefix_gain[m].

5. The maximum total damage is the base sum (sum of all original dmg) plus the maximum sum of gains across all possible a_used and m.

But wait, the base sum is sum of original dmg, and each gain_i is (hp_i * 2^k_i - dmg_i) if gain_i is positive. So adding the sum of selected gain_i's gives the total damage.

So, the steps are:

Compute the base sum as sum(dmg_i for all creatures).

Compute all possible gain_i's (max over k=0..a of (hp_i*2^k - dmg_i), but only if positive).

Sort them in descending order.

Then for each a_used (from 0 to a):

   Find the maximum m such that sum of k_i's of the first m gains <= a_used and m <=b.

   The total gain for this a_used is prefix_gain[m].

   Then, the remaining a_used_remaining = a_used - sum_k[m]. But since we can't use any more a_used (we are allowed exactly a_used?), wait no. a_used is the total allowed sum of k_i's. So the sum of the first m's k_i's must be <=a_used. But perhaps there are more a_used left. But since the options are sorted in descending order, any further gains would have lower gains, so it's better to take as many as possible early.

So for each a_used, the maximum possible gain is the maximum prefix_gain[m] for m up to min(b, len(gains)), where sum_k[m] <=a_used.

Then, the answer is the maximum over all a_used (from 0 to a) of (base + the gain for a_used).

But how to compute this?

Let's outline the code steps.

First, read all creatures, compute their base damage sum.

Then for each creature:

   Compute for k in 0 to a:

       possible_hp = hp_i * (2**k)

       possible_gain = possible_hp - dmg_i

       keep track of the maximum possible gain and the corresponding k.

   If the maximum possible gain is positive, add it to the gains list (as (gain, k)).

Sort the gains list in descending order of gain.

Compute the prefix sums for gains and k's.

Then, for each possible a_used in 0 to a:

   sum_k_so_far =0

   sum_gain_so_far=0

   m =0

   for i in 0 to len(gains)-1:

       if m >=b:

           break

       current_k = gains[i][1]

       if sum_k_so_far + current_k <=a_used:

           sum_k_so_far += current_k

           sum_gain_so_far += gains[i][0]

           m +=1

       else:

           continue

   but this approach is O(a * n), which for a=20 and n=2e5 is manageable.

But wait, the gains list could be of size up to 2e5. So for each a_used, looping through all elements until m reaches b or sum_k exceeds a_used.

This would be O(a * len(gains)), which is 20 * 2e5 = 4e6 operations.

But perhaps a more efficient way is to precompute the prefix sums of the k's and gains, and for each a_used, find the maximum m where the sum of the first m k's <=a_used and m <=b.

But since the prefix sum of k's can be in any order (since the gains are sorted by gain, not by k), the sum may not be monotonically increasing. Therefore, we can't binary search.

For example, the first element could have k=5, the next k=3, then sum after two elements is 8, but maybe the next element has k=1, sum is 9, etc. So the sum of k's could increase, but not necessarily in a way that allows binary search.

Thus, the only way is to precompute the prefix sums and then for each a_used, iterate through the prefix sums until sum_k exceeds a_used.

So, let's proceed with the code steps.

First, compute for each creature the best (gain, k) pair.

How to compute the best k for a creature:

For a given hp and dmg, we want to find the maximum value of hp*2^k -dmg, for k from 0 to a (inclusive). The k can be up to a. So for each creature, compute all possible k (0 to a), calculate hp*2^k, find which gives the maximum (hp*2^k -dmg). Then, if this maximum is positive, that's the gain and the corresponding k.

But for a=20, 2^20 is about a million, but hp can be up to 1e9. So hp*2^20 can be up to 1e9 * 1e6 = 1e15, which is manageable in Python.

So for each creature, we can iterate k from 0 to min(a, something) and compute hp * 2^k.

Wait, but the maximum possible k is a. For example, a=20, the maximum possible k is 20. So for each creature, compute for k=0 to a.

But this is O(n * a) steps, which for n=2e5 and a=20 is 4e6 steps, acceptable.

So for each creature:

max_gain = 0

best_k =0

current_hp = hp_i

current_gain = current_hp -dmg_i

if current_gain > max_gain:

   max_gain = current_gain

   best_k =0

for k in 1 to a:

   current_hp *=2

   current_gain = current_hp -dmg_i

   if current_gain > max_gain:

       max_gain = current_gain

       best_k =k

But wait, this loops a times per creature. For a=20, it's manageable.

Alternatively, since 2^k can be computed as a bit shift, but even with multiplication, it's manageable.

Once we have the max_gain, if it's positive, then we add (max_gain, best_k) to the gains list.

Then, sort this gains list in descending order of max_gain.

Once sorted, we can precompute prefix sums of gains and k's.

prefix_gains = [0]

prefix_ks = [0]

for gain, k in sorted_gains:

   prefix_gains.append(prefix_gains[-1] + gain)

   prefix_ks.append(prefix_ks[-1] +k)

Then, for each a_used (from 0 to a), we need to find the maximum m such that prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

The maximum possible m is the largest m where prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

Once found, the sum is prefix_gains[m].

But how to compute m for each a_used?

The problem is that prefix_ks is not sorted, so even for a_used, we can't binary search. But since the gains are sorted in descending order, perhaps the prefix_ks is a non-decreasing sequence. Wait, no. For example, the first gain could have k=5, sum_ks[1] =5. The next gain has k=3, sum_ks[2] =8. The next gain has k=4, sum_ks[3] =12. So the prefix_ks is non-decreasing. Because each k is non-negative. Because even if the next gain's k is smaller than the previous, the sum will be the previous sum plus a non-negative number, thus the prefix_ks is non-decreasing.

Ah, because each k is >=0. So the prefix_ks is a non-decreasing array.

So for a_used, we can binary search for the largest m such that prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

This is possible!

Yes. Because prefix_ks is non-decreasing. So for each a_used, the maximum possible m is the largest m where prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

So the steps would be:

For each a_used in 0 to a:

   low =0

   high = min(len(prefix_ks)-1, b)

   m =0

   while low <= high:

       mid = (low + high) //2

       if prefix_ks[mid] <=a_used:

           m = mid

           low = mid +1

       else:

           high = mid -1

   sum_gain = prefix_gains[m]

   max_total = max(max_total, sum_gain)

So for each a_used, we can binary search in O(log m) time. Since a_used is up to 20, and each binary search is O(log (min(b, len(gains)))), which is manageable.

But len(gains) can be up to 2e5, so the binary search is O(log 2e5) ~ 20 steps per a_used. So total steps are 20 * 20 = 400 steps.

This is much more efficient than the O(a * len(gains)) approach.

Thus, the optimal approach is:

1. Precompute for each creature the best possible (gain, k) pair.

2. Collect all such pairs with gain >0.

3. Sort them in descending order of gain.

4. Precompute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

5. For each a_used from 0 to a:

   - Find the maximum m where prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

   - The corresponding sum_gain is prefix_gains[m].

6. The answer is the base sum plus the maximum sum_gain across all a_used.

But what about the type 2 spells? Because each gain requires 1 type 2 spell. So the number of gains selected (m) can't exceed b. But in the code above, when we compute m, we take min(len(gains), b). So the binary search high is set to min(b, len(prefix_ks)-1). Because each gain in the sorted list is a candidate, but selecting more than b is not allowed.

Yes.

So the code steps:

Read n, a, b.

Read each creature's hp and dmg.

Compute base_sum as sum of all dmg.

Compute gains list:

for each creature:

   max_gain =0

   best_k=0

   current_hp = hp

   current_gain = current_hp -dmg

   if current_gain > max_gain:

       max_gain = current_gain

       best_k=0

   for k in 1 to a:

       current_hp *=2

       current_gain = current_hp -dmg

       if current_gain > max_gain:

           max_gain = current_gain

           best_k =k

   if max_gain >0:

       gains.append( (max_gain, best_k) )

Sort gains in descending order of max_gain.

Compute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

Then, for each a_used in 0..a:

   find the largest m where prefix_ks[m] <=a_used and m <=b.

   sum_gain = prefix_gains[m]

   possible_total = base_sum + sum_gain

   keep track of the maximum possible_total.

But wait, what if a_used is larger than the sum of the k's in the first m elements. For example, a_used is 10, but the sum of k's for m=5 is 8. Then, even if there are more a_used available, we can't use them because we're limited by the number of type 2 spells (m <=b). So no, because each gain requires a type 2 spell, so the maximum m is min(b, len(gains)), and the sum of k's can't exceed a_used.

But the a_used can be any value from 0 to a, but in the code, the a_used is the total available. So the code checks for each possible a_used (the sum of k's used can't exceed a_used).

Thus, the maximum possible answer is the maximum of all possible_total over all a_used from 0 to a.

But what about when a_used is larger than a? Because a_used is in 0..a, so no. Because the code loops a_used from 0 to a.

So this code will consider all possible allocations of type 1 spells (sum of k's up to a) and type 2 spells (number of gains selected up to b), and select the best possible.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

2 1 1

10 15

6 1

Creature 1: hp=10, dmg=15.

Compute max_gain:

For k=0: hp=10, gain=10-15= -5.

k=0's gain is negative. So for k=0, no gain.

But for k=1: hp=20, gain=20-15=5.

So best gain is 5, k=1.

Creature 2: hp=6, dmg=1.

k=0: hp=6, gain=6-1=5.

k=1: hp=12, gain=12-1=11. But since a=1, can k=1 be used? Yes.

So best gain is 11, k=1.

So gains list is sorted as (11,1), (5,1).

prefix_ks is [0, 1, 2].

prefix_gains is [0,11, 16].

Now, possible a_used can be 0,1.

For a_used=0:

We need sum of k's <=0, m <=1.

Looking for m where prefix_ks[m] <=0.

Only m=0 is possible. So sum_gain=0. Total is 15+1 +0=16.

For a_used=1:

sum_ks <=1 and m<=1.

The maximum m is 1 (prefix_ks[1]=1 <=1, m=1). sum_gain=11.

Total is 16 +11=27.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code works.

Sample Input 2:

3 0 3

10 8

7 11

5 2

Creatures:

Creature 1: hp=10, dmg=8. a=0, so k can be 0.

gain=10-8=2. So added to gains.

Creature2: hp=7, dmg=11. gain=7-11= -4. So no gain.

Creature3: hp=5, dmg=2. gain=5-2=3. Added to gains.

So gains list is [(3,0), (2,0)].

sorted in descending order.

prefix_ks: 0,0,0.

prefix_gains: 0,3,5.

For a_used=0:

we can take m up to min(3, 2) =2. sum_ks[m] <=0. Since sum_ks[2] =0+0=0.

so sum_gain=3+2=5. But since b=3, can we take all 2 gains (requires 2 type 2's) and then possibly take another gain (but there are none). So the sum is 5. Total base is 8+11+2=21. 21 +5=26.

Which matches the sample.

So the code works.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

Edge Cases:

- When a=0. Only k=0 is considered for each creature.

- When b=0. Then no gains can be selected. So total is base sum.

- When a=0 and b=0. Same as above.

Another case: when the maximum gain is achieved by not using all a_used.

But code handles this.

So now, implement the code.

The steps:

Read n, a, b.

Read n lines of hpi and dmgi.

Compute base_sum.

Compute gains list.

Sort gains in descending order.

Compute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

Compute for each a_used in 0..a, find the maximum m using binary search.

Take the maximum possible_total.

Now, code.

But in Python, for large n, we need to read the inputs efficiently.

But with n up to 2e5, using input() and split is manageable.

But in code, for each creature:

Compute the best gain.

But for a up to 20, and n up to 2e5, this is O(n*a) time.

Implementing the code.

Now, code:

Read n, a, b.

base_sum =0

gains = []

for each of n lines:

    hp, dmg = map(int, input().split())

    base_sum += dmg

    max_g = 0

    best_k =0

    current_hp = hp

    current_g = current_hp - dmg

    if current_g > max_g:

        max_g = current_g

        best_k =0

    # Now compute for k from 1 to a:

    temp_hp = hp

    for k in range(1, a+1):

        temp_hp *=2

        current_g = temp_hp - dmg

        if current_g > max_g:

            max_g = current_g

            best_k =k

    if max_g >0:

        gains.append( (max_g, best_k) )

Sort gains in descending order of max_g.

Compute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

Now, prefix_ks and prefix_gains are lists starting with 0.

Then, for each a_used in 0 to a:

    low =0

    high = min(len(gains), b) # because m can't exceed b.

    # So the maximum possible m is min(b, len(gains)).

    # but in binary search, we can set high to min(b, len(gains)).

    # Wait, the prefix_ks has len(gains)+1 elements. So m can be up to len(gains).

    # So for the binary search, the high is min(b, len(gains)).

    # Because m can't exceed b, nor len(gains).

    # So the maximum possible m is min(b, len(gains)).

    # So in the prefix_ks, we need to find the largest m <= min(b, len(gains)) where prefix_ks[m] <=a_used.

    max_m = min(b, len(gains))

    # binary search in prefix_ks from 0 to max_m.

    # Because prefix_ks is non-decreasing.

    left =0

    right = max_m

    best =0

    while left <= right:

        mid = (left + right) //2

        if prefix_ks[mid] <=a_used:

            best = mid

            left = mid +1

        else:

            right = mid -1

    sum_gain = prefix_gains[best]

    current_total = base_sum + sum_gain

    update the maximum.

Thus, the code will compute this.

But how to compute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

In code:

gains.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

prefix_ks = [0]

prefix_gains = [0]

for g, k in gains:

    prefix_ks.append( prefix_ks[-1] +k )

    prefix_gains.append( prefix_gains[-1] +g )

Then, for each a_used in 0..a:

    max_possible_m = min(b, len(gains))

    left =0

    right = max_possible_m

    best_m =0

    while left <= right:

        mid = (left + right) //2

        if prefix_ks[mid] <=a_used:

            best_m = mid

            left = mid +1

        else:

            right = mid -1

    sum_gain = prefix_gains[best_m]

    current_total = base_sum + sum_gain

    if current_total > max_total:

        max_total = current_total

Thus, the code.

But wait, for a_used, which is the sum of k's allowed. So for example, a_used can be 5, but sum of k's for m=3 is 6, which is over. So the binary search finds the largest m where sum is <=a_used.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, code:

Read inputs.

Handle cases where a=0.

Implementing:

Here's the Python code:

Read n, a, b.

Read n lines.

Compute gains.

Sort gains.

Compute prefix_ks and prefix_gains.

Loop through a_used from 0 to a.

Find best_m for each a_used.

Compute the maximum.

Finally, output the maximum.

But also, the code must handle the case when a=0.

Now, code:

n, a_total, b_total = map(int, input().split())

base =0

gains = []

for _ in range(n):

    hp, dmg = map(int, input().split())

    base += dmg

    max_g = 0

    best_k =0

    current_hp = hp

    current_g = current_hp - dmg

    if current_g > max_g:

        max_g = current_g

        best_k =0

    temp_hp = hp

    for k in range(1, a_total +1):

        temp_hp *=2

        current_g = temp_hp - dmg

        if current_g > max_g:

            max_g = current_g

            best_k =k

    if max_g >0:

        gains.append( (max_g, best_k) )

# Sort gains in descending order of max_g

gains.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

prefix_ks = [0]

prefix_gains = [0]

for g, k in gains:

    prefix_ks.append( prefix_ks[-1] + k )

    prefix_gains.append( prefix_gains[-1] + g )

max_total = base

for a_used in range(0, a_total +1):

    # The total a_used is the sum of k's allowed.

    # Find the largest m where sum of k's <=a_used, and m <=b_total.

    max_possible_m = min(b_total, len(gains))

    left =0

    right = max_possible_m

    best_m =0

    while left <= right:

        mid = (left + right) //2

        if mid > len(prefix_ks) -1:

            # Handle cases where mid exceeds prefix_ks length (but max_possible_m is up to len(gains) which is <= len(prefix_ks)-1)

            # Because len(prefix_ks) = len(gains) +1.

            # So mid can be up to len(gains).

            # But prefix_ks has len(gains)+1 elements (0..len(gains)).

            right = mid -1

            continue

        if prefix_ks[mid] <= a_used:

            best_m = mid

            left = mid +1

        else:

            right = mid -1

    current_total = base + prefix_gains[best_m]

    if current_total > max_total:

        max_total = current_total

print(max_total)

Wait, but what if a_used exceeds the sum of k's in the first m elements, but there are enough a_used left to include more gains?

No, because the code is considering each a_used (from 0 to a_total) and for each, the maximum possible m is the largest such that sum of k's up to m <=a_used, and m <=b_total.

Thus, the code should handle all possibilities.

Testing sample input 1:

After processing, gains is [(11,1), (5,1)].

prefix_ks is [0,1,2].

prefix_gains is [0,11,16].

Loop a_used from 0 to 1.

For a_used=0:

max_possible_m is min(1, 2) =1.

binary search between 0 and 1.

Check mid=0.5 → mid=0: prefix_ks[0] is 0 <=0. best_m=0.

left becomes 1.

mid= (0+1)//2=0.5 → mid=0.

Wait, perhaps the binary search code should start with left=0 and right= max_possible_m.

Wait, in the code:

max_possible_m is min(b_total, len(gains)).

For sample input 1, len(gains) is 2, b_total=1. So max_possible_m=1.

So for a_used=0:

left=0, right=1.

mid=0 ( (0+1)//2=0).

prefix_ks[0] is 0 <=0 → best_m=0. left becomes 1.

mid= (1+1)//2=1. Check prefix_ks[1]=1 <=0? No. So right=0. Loop ends. Best_m is 0.

sum_gain=0.

For a_used=1:

max_possible_m=1.

left=0, right=1.

mid=0: prefix_ks[0] <=1 → yes. best_m=0, left=1.

mid=1: prefix_ks[1]=1 <=1 → yes. best_m=1, left=2. Exit. sum_gain=11.

Thus, the code returns 27.

Sample 2: a_total=0.

For each a_used in 0 to 0 (only 0).

max_possible_m is min(3, len(gains)).

len(gains)=2, so max_possible_m=2.

prefix_ks for 0,0,0.

So for a_used=0:

binary search between 0 and 2 (since max_possible_m is min(3,2)=2? Wait, no. b_total=3, len(gains)=2. So max_possible_m=2.

Check mid=2: prefix_ks[2] =0 <=0 → yes. So best_m=2. sum_gain=3+2=5. Which is correct.

Thus, code works.

So the code should handle all cases.
