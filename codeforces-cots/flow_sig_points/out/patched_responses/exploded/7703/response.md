Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the problem is about mushrooms that grow in a line. Every minute, between every two neighboring mushrooms, a new one appears whose weight is the sum of the two adjacent ones. Then, after x minutes, the gnomes sort them and then after another y minutes, the process happens again, but possibly with the sorted array. We need to compute the total weight modulo p after x + y minutes.

Hmm, the key steps here are simulating the growth for x minutes, then sorting, then simulating for y more minutes. But since x and y can be up to 1e18, we can't simulate each minute step by step. We need to find a mathematical pattern or formula to compute the total quickly.

First, let's think about what happens each minute. Let's model the array after each expansion. For example, the initial array is A. After one minute, between each pair of elements, a new element is added. So the new array becomes [A[0], A[0]+A[1], A[1], A[1]+A[2], A[2], ...]. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says between every two neighboring mushrooms, a new one grows with weight equal to the sum of the two neighbors. So the original array has n elements. After one minute, each of the n-1 gaps between adjacent elements gets a new element. So the new array's length becomes n + (n-1) = 2n-1. The elements are arranged such that between each pair a new element is inserted as their sum. So for example, the original array a1, a2, a3 becomes a1, a1+a2, a2, a2+a3, a3. So the new array is [a1, a1+a2, a2, a2+a3, a3].

But each minute, this process repeats. So after m minutes, how does the array look? Let's think about the pattern. The length after m minutes is (n-1)*2^m +1. Because each minute, the length increases by (current length -1). Let's see: original length L0 = n. After first minute, L1 = L0 + (L0-1) = 2L0 -1. Then next minute L2 = L1 + (L1-1) = 2L1 -1. Hmm, but solving this recurrence, L(m) = 2^m * (n) - (2^m -1). Wait, maybe another way. Let's see for m steps. Each step, the number of elements is L = (L_prev) + (L_prev -1) = 2*L_prev -1. So this is a recurrence relation. Solving this, for example:

L0 = n

L1 = 2n -1

L2 = 2*(2n-1) -1 = 4n -3

L3 = 2*(4n-3) -1 =8n -7

So L(m) = (n-1)*2^m +1. Because for example, when m=1: (n-1)*2 +1 = 2n-2+1=2n-1. Which matches. Similarly for m=2: 4n-4+1=4n-3. Correct. So yes, the length after m minutes is L(m) = (n-1)*2^m +1.

But even more important than the array structure is the sum of the array after m minutes. Because for the problem, after x minutes, the sum is needed, but then the array is sorted. Then after y minutes, the sum is again needed. But when x is large, we can't compute the array, so we need to find a way to compute the sum after m minutes directly.

Let's find the sum after m minutes. Let's denote S(m) as the sum after m minutes.

How does the sum change each minute? Let's think: each new element is the sum of two adjacent elements. So for each of the (current length -1) gaps, we add their sum. So the sum increases by the sum of all the adjacent pairs.

For example, original sum S(0) = sum(a_i). After one minute, the new elements are the sum of each adjacent pair. There are (n-1) such sums, and the total sum becomes S(0) + sum_{i=0 to n-2} (a_i + a_{i+1}) }.

So the sum after first minute is S(1) = S(0) + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a_i + a_{i+1}) }.

But sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a_i + a_{i+1}) = sum a_i (from i=0 to n-2) + sum a_{i+1} (from i=0 to n-2) = (sum a_i - a_{n-1}) ) + (sum a_i - a_0) ) = 2*S(0) - a_0 - a_{n-1}.

So S(1) = S(0) + 2*S(0) - a_0 - a_{n-1} = 3*S(0) - (a_0 + a_{n-1}).

But when m increases further, what happens? Let's see for m=2. The next sum would be S(2) = S(1) + sum of adjacent pairs in the array after m=1.

But the array after m=1 has elements like [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2, ... a_{n-1}]. The sum of adjacent pairs here is sum_{i=0 to (2n-2)-1} (element_i + element_{i+1}).

Hmm, but calculating this might get complicated. However, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think recursively.

Suppose after m minutes, the sum is S(m). Then, when we perform the next step (m+1), the new elements added are the sum of each adjacent pair in the current array. The sum of these new elements is sum_{i}(current[i] + current[i+1]). This is equal to sum_{i} current[i] * (number of times it appears in the sum). For example, for the first step, each element (except the first and last) appears twice. Let's see:

In the initial array, the adjacent pairs are (a0,a1), (a1,a2), ..., (a_{n-2},a_{n-1}).

Sum of pairs is (a0+a1) + (a1+a2) + ... + a_{n-2} + a_{n-1} }.

Which is a0 + 2a1 + 2a2 + ... + 2a_{n-2} + a_{n-1}.

So that's 2*(sum a_i) - a0 - a_{n-1}.

In the first step, that sum is 2S(0) - a0 -a_{n-1}.

So S(1) = S(0) + (2S(0) -a0 -a_{n-1}) ) = 3S(0) - (a0 +a_{n-1}).

What about S(2)?

The current array after m=1 has sum S(1). The sum of adjacent pairs in this array would be sum of (element_i + element_{i+1}) for all i in the array. Let's call this Q.

Then S(2) = S(1) + Q.

But Q can be computed as sum (element_i + element_{i+1}) = sum element_i * (number of times it appears in the sum terms).

Each element in the array, except the first and last, is part of two adjacent pairs. For example, in the array after m=1, the elements are:

a0, (a0+a1), a1, (a1+a2), a2, ..., a_{n-1}.

The pairs are:

a0 and (a0+a1) → contributes a0 once.

(a0+a1) and a1 → contributes a0+a1 once, and a1 once.

a1 and (a1+a2) → contributes a1 once and (a1+a2) once.

And so on.

So the sum Q for m=1's array is:

a0 (appears once in the first pair) +

(a0+a1) (appears once in the first pair, once in the second pair) +

a1 (appears once in the second pair, once in the third pair) +

(a1+a2) (appears once in third pair, once in fourth) +

...

So each element in the array, except the first and last, appears in two pairs. The first element appears once (only in the first pair), the last element appears once (only in the last pair).

Wait, no. Let's count for the array after m=1. The array has length 2n-1. The number of adjacent pairs is (2n-1)-1 = 2n-2.

Each pair is (element_i, element_{i+1}).

So for the array [a, a+b, b, b+c, c], the pairs are (a, a+b), (a+b, b), (b, b+c), (b+c, c). Summing these: (a + (a+b)) + ((a+b) + b) + (b + (b+c)) + ((b+c) + c) = a + a + b + a + b + b + b + b + c + b + c + c = 3a + 6b + 3c.

Hmm. Which is 3*(a + 2b + c). So the sum is 3 times the sum of the array after m=1, minus 3b (since the sum after m=1 is a + (a+b) + b + (b+c) + c = a + a + 2b + b + 2c = 2a + 3b + 2c. Wait, but 3*(sum) would be 3*(2a + 3b + 2c) = 6a +9b +6c. But the sum of the pairs is 3a +6b +3c, which is 3*(a + 2b + c). Hmm, maybe there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a general formula for the sum of adjacent pairs in the array after m minutes. Let's denote the sum of adjacent pairs as Q(m). Then S(m+1) = S(m) + Q(m).

We need to find a recurrence for Q(m).

Looking back, for m=0:

The array is the original array. The sum of adjacent pairs is Q(0) = sum_{i=0 to n-2} (a_i + a_{i+1}) } = 2S(0) - a0 - a_{n-1}.

For m=1:

The array after m=1 is the array after inserting sums. The sum of adjacent pairs in this array is Q(1). How can we express Q(1) in terms of Q(0) or other known terms?

Alternatively, perhaps after m steps, the sum Q(m) can be expressed in terms of S(m) and the first and last elements of the array after m steps.

But how do the first and last elements change over steps?

Wait, in each step, when we insert new elements between adjacent pairs, the first element of the array remains the same. Because inserting a new element after the first element. For example, original array starts with a0. After inserting between a0 and a1, the new array starts with a0. Similarly, in the next steps, the first element remains a0. Similarly, the last element remains a_{n-1}.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Original array: [a0, a1, a2]. After one step, it becomes [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2]. The first element is a0, last is a2. Next step, inserting between each pair. The first element remains a0, last a2. So after each step, the first and last elements of the array are the same as the original.

Ah! So regardless of the number of steps m, the first element of the array after m minutes is a0, and the last element is a_{n-1}.

That's an important observation. So for any m, the first element is a0 and the last is a_{n-1}.

So, when calculating Q(m), which is the sum of adjacent pairs in the array after m minutes, the sum can be expressed as 2*S(m) - a0 - a_{n-1}.

Wait, because in the array after m steps, the sum of adjacent pairs would be for each pair (current[i], current[i+1]). The sum is sum (current[i] + current[i+1]) = sum current[i] + sum current[i+1] = sum current (except the last element) + sum current (except the first element). So the total is (sum current - a_{last}) + (sum current - a_first) ) = 2*sum current - a_first - a_last. But sum current is S(m), and a_first is a0, a_last is a_{n-1}.

So Q(m) = 2*S(m) - a0 -a_{n-1}.

Thus, the recurrence relation for S(m) is:

S(m+1) = S(m) + Q(m) = S(m) + 2*S(m) - a0 - a_{n-1} = 3*S(m) - (a0 + a_{n-1}).

This is a linear recurrence relation! So for each step m, S(m+1) = 3*S(m) - K, where K = a0 + a_{n-1}.

This is a linear recurrence of the form S(m) = 3*S(m-1) - K.

This can be solved using standard methods for linear recurrences. Let's find a closed-form formula for S(m).

The homogeneous recurrence is S(m) = 3*S(m-1). The particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part can be found by assuming a constant solution.

Let's suppose that the particular solution is C. Then substituting into the recurrence:

C = 3*C - K → 0 = 2C - K → C = K/2.

So the general solution is S(m) = A*3^m + K/2.

To find A, we use the initial condition S(0) = sum_initial. At m=0:

S(0) = A*3^0 + K/2 → sum_initial = A + K/2 → A = sum_initial - K/2.

Thus, S(m) = (sum_initial - K/2) *3^m + K/2.

Simplify:

S(m) = sum_initial * 3^m - (K/2)*3^m + K/2.

Factor K/2:

= sum_initial *3^m + K/2 (1 -3^m).

But K = a0 + a_{n-1}.

So S(m) = sum_initial *3^m + (a0 + a_{n-1})/2 * (1 -3^m).

Alternatively:

S(m) = 3^m * sum_initial - (a0 +a_{n-1})/2 (3^m -1).

That's the formula for the sum after m steps.

So this is a huge insight. So regardless of the array's structure, the sum after m minutes can be computed using this formula. So even if x is 1e18, we can compute S(x) modulo p efficiently using exponentiation.

But wait, but after x minutes, the array is sorted again. So the sorted array after x minutes is the same as the original array sorted? No, wait the problem says that after x minutes, the array may have violated the order. The gnomes then sort the array. So after x minutes, regardless of how the array looks, they sort it in non-decreasing order and then proceed for y minutes.

So the process is:

Original array (sorted) → after x steps (unsorted) → sorted array → after y steps (new array) → sum.

But during the x steps, the array is allowed to grow, but after x steps, it's sorted again. Then during y steps, the initial array is the sorted one (which is the sorted array after x steps), and then y steps are applied.

So the problem splits into two parts:

1. Compute the sum after x steps, then sort the array. But during the x steps, the array has been growing and the sum is S(x). But when sorted, the sum remains the same, but the array's elements are sorted. However, after sorting, the array's structure is changed. So when we apply the next y steps, the sum of the sorted array after y steps is different.

But how does the sorted array affect the sum after y steps? Because when the array is sorted, the first element is the smallest, the last is the largest. So K in the formula (a0 + a_{n-1}) would be the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted array. But after sorting, the array is in non-decreasing order. So the sorted array after x steps is the sorted list of all elements generated after x steps. But computing that sorted array's sum after y steps requires knowing K' = (sorted_a0 + sorted_anew), where anew is the size of the sorted array.

Wait, but after x steps, the array's length is L(x) = (n-1)*2^x + 1. So after x steps, the array is of length L(x) = (n-1)*2^x +1. Then, after sorting, the array's length is the same. Then, the sorted array is a sorted version of that array. Then, during y steps, the array grows again, and the sum after y steps is S(y) computed based on the sorted array's sum and K'.

But how to model this?

So the process is:

Original array (sorted) → x steps → array A (unsorted) → sorted array B → y steps → compute sum of array C (after y steps) modulo p.

But the problem is that after x steps, the array A is very large (since x can be up to 1e18, so L(x) is up to (1e6)*2^1e18 +1, which is way beyond any computational possibility). But when sorted, the array B would be a sorted array of L(x) elements. However, when we process y steps on array B, the sum after y steps can be computed using the formula S(y) = 3^y * sum_B - (b0 + b_last)/2 (3^y -1), where sum_B is the sum of array B (which is the same as sum_A, since sorting doesn't change the sum), and b0 is the first element of B (the smallest element in A), and b_last is the last element of B (the largest element in A).

So the steps are:

1. Compute sum_A = S(x), using the formula for the original array. Then, when sorted, sum_B = sum_A.

Then, after y steps, sum_C = 3^y * sum_B - (b0 + b_last) / 2 * (3^y -1).

But the problem is that after x steps, array A has L(x) elements, but when sorted, the first element is the minimum of A, and the last element is the maximum of A. So, how do we find the min and max of array A after x steps?

Wait, but the array after x steps is generated by inserting sums between elements. However, when you do this, the elements are arranged in a way that the array is a binary expansion. For example, after x=1, the array is the original array with inserted sums. After x=2, each pair in that array has their sum inserted. But the structure is such that each element in the array after x steps is a sum of certain elements from the original array, but this depends on the path taken during insertions. However, the array after x steps is very structured, but when sorted, the min and max may not be the original a0 and a_{n-1} anymore.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: the original array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Each step inserts new elements between existing ones. The new elements are sums of adjacent pairs. Since the original array is sorted (non-decreasing), the sum of two adjacent elements is at least as large as each of them. For example, if the array is [a, b], with a ≤ b, then the inserted element is a+b. The new array is [a, a+b, b], which is not sorted, but the inserted element is larger than a and b. So after the first step, the array is [a, a+b, b], which is not sorted. But after x steps, the array becomes more complex, but the elements can be in any order. However, when the array is sorted again, the first element of the sorted array will be the minimum of all elements generated after x steps, and the last element is the maximum.

So the key is to find the min and max of the array after x steps. Because in the formula for sum_C (after y steps on the sorted array), the sum is sum_B *3^y - (min + max)/2 * (3^y -1).

So the problem reduces to:

Compute sum_x = S(x) (using the original array's a0 and a_{n-1}).

Compute min_x and max_x of the array after x steps.

Then, sum_B is sum_x (since sorted sum is same as unsorted).

Then compute sum_after_y = 3^y * sum_x - (min_x + max_x)/2 * (3^y -1).

But how to compute min_x and max_x after x steps?

This is the crux of the problem. Because after x steps, the array is huge, but the min and max can be determined by some pattern.

Let's think about the min and max during each step.

Original array is sorted. So the min is a0, max is a_{n-1}.

After one step, the array is [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2, ... a_{n-1}].

The elements after first step:

The inserted elements are a0+a1, a1+a2, etc. These inserted elements are larger than their adjacent original elements because a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}. So a0 <= a0+a1 (since a1 >= a0). Similarly, a1 <= a0+a1 (since a0 >=0? Wait, no, the problem says 0 ≤ ai ≤1e9. So a0 can be zero, but a1 can be larger. So in any case, a0 + a1 >= a1? No. For example, if a0 is 1 and a1 is 2: 1+2=3 >=2. So yes. If a0 is 3 and a1 is 2, but that's not possible because the initial array is sorted. So since the initial array is sorted non-decreasing, a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}.

So the sum of a_i and a_{i+1} is >= a_{i+1}, since a_i <= a_{i+1}, so a_i +a_{i+1} >= a_{i} +a_i = 2a_i >= a_{i+1} only if a_i >= a_{i+1}/2. Wait, not sure. But perhaps the inserted elements are >= the original elements. For example, in the first step, the inserted elements are a0 +a1, which is >= a1 since a0 >=0 and a1 >=a0. Wait, a0 +a1 >= a1? If a0 is 1 and a1 is 2: 3 >=2 → yes. If a0 is 0 and a1 is 2: 0+2=2 >=2 → yes. So in general, the inserted elements are >= the adjacent elements. So after the first step, the array is [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2, ..., a_{n-1}]. The new elements (inserted) are all >= the original elements (since a_i <= a_{i+1} implies a_i +a_{i+1} >= a_{i+1}).

So the min of the array after first step is a0. Because all inserted elements are >= a0. The max is a_{n-1} +a_{n-2} (if n>1). Wait, for example, if n=2, original array [a0, a1], after one step: [a0, a0+a1, a1]. The max is a0+a1.

But the original array is sorted, so a1 >=a0.

So in the first step, the max is a0 +a1 (if n=2). The original a1 is the last element of the original array, but after inserting, the new elements could be larger than a1.

But after x steps, the array has more elements. What's the min and max after x steps?

Wait, after each step, the array's first and last elements are the same as the original. Because each insertion adds elements between existing ones, but the first and last elements are not changed. Wait, no. Wait, the first element in the array after m steps is a0. Because in each step, the first element is not modified. Let me see:

Original array: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}].

After one step: insert elements between each pair, so the first element remains a0.

After another step, insert elements between each pair again. The first element is still a0.

So after m steps, the first element is a0, the last is a_{n-1}.

But during the steps, between them, elements are inserted. So in the array after m steps, the first element is a0, last is a_{n-1}.

But what about the other elements? Are there any elements smaller than a0 or larger than a_{n-1}?

No. Because all inserted elements are sums of adjacent elements, which are >= their adjacent elements in the initial array. Since the initial array is sorted, each element a_i <= a_{i+1}.

But when we insert a sum between a_i and a_{i+1}, the sum is a_i +a_{i+1} >=a_{i+1} (since a_i >=0). So the new elements are >= a_{i+1}, which is >= a_i. So in the array after step 1, the elements are a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, etc. So the min is a0, the max is a_{n-1} +a_{n-2} (if n>1) or a0+a1 (if n=2).

Wait, but for n=3, original array [a0, a1, a2], with a0 <=a1 <=a2. After step 1, the array becomes [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2]. The elements are a0, a0+a1 (>=a1), a1, a1+a2 (>=a2), a2. The max in this array is a1+a2. Which is larger than a2.

So the maximum in the array after m steps is the sum of the two largest elements in the array. But wait, no. For example, after step 2, the array will have elements inserted between each pair. Let's see:

After step 1: [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1+a2, a2].

After step 2, between each adjacent pair:

a0 and a0+a1 → insert a0 + (a0+a1) = 2a0 +a1.

a0+a1 and a1 → insert (a0+a1) +a1 = a0 +2a1.

a1 and a1+a2 → insert a1 + (a1+a2) = 2a1 +a2.

a1+a2 and a2 → insert (a1+a2) +a2 =a1 +2a2.

So the array becomes:

a0, 2a0 +a1, a0+a1, a0+2a1, a1, 2a1 +a2, a1+a2, a1+2a2, a2.

The max here is a1+2a2, which is a1 +2a2. Since a2 is >=a1, this is >= a2.

So after each step, the max element in the array increases. But how?

In the original array, the max is a_{n-1}.

After step 1, the max is a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} (if n>1).

After step 2, the max is a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}? Not sure. Let's see for n=3, after step 2, the max is a1 + 2a2. Which is a1 (the original a1, which is a1 <=a2) plus 2a2. So a1+2a2 can be larger than a2 if a1 is positive.

But in the array after step 2, the elements are a0, 2a0+a1, a0+a1, a0+2a1, a1, 2a1 +a2, a1+a2, a1+2a2, a2.

So the elements are a0 (original), 2a0+a1 (which is a0*2 +a1), etc. The max here is a1+2a2. Which is (a1) + 2a2. Since a1 <=a2, this is <= 3a2.

But after each step, the maximum seems to be the sum of the previous maximum and the element before it. Or perhaps there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum after m steps is (a_{n-1} + (sum of adjacent elements in the path leading to the last element)).

But this is unclear. However, perhaps we can find a pattern for the max and min after m steps.

Wait, for the min:

After each step, the first element is a0, which is the smallest in the original array. All new elements are sums of elements >= a0, so the min remains a0.

So the min after m steps is always a0.

Similarly, the max after m steps is generated by the sum of the two largest elements in the array from the previous step. Let's see:

Original max is a_{n-1}.

After step 1, the max is a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}.

After step 2, the max is (a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) + a_{n-1} = a_{n-1}*2 +a_{n-2}.

After step 3, the max would be (a_{n-1}*2 +a_{n-2}) + (a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) = 3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}.

Hmm, this seems to be following a Fibonacci-like sequence. Let's see:

Let's define Max(m) as the maximum after m steps.

Max(0) = a_{n-1}.

Max(1) = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} → since inserting after a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}.

But after that, when inserting between the previous Max and a_{n-1}, which is no longer in the array. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the max after m steps can be expressed as a linear combination of a_{n-1} and a_{n-2}.

Let's think for m steps.

For m=0: Max= a_{n-1}.

m=1: a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}.

m=2: (a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) + a_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}.

m=3: (2a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) + (a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) = 3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}.

m=4: (3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}) ) + (2a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}) ) =5a_{n-1} +3a_{n-2}.

m=5: 8a_{n-1} +5a_{n-2}.

Wait, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence. Indeed, the coefficients for a_{n-1} and a_{n-2} follow Fibonacci numbers.

For m steps:

Coefficient of a_{n-1} is Fib(2m), and coefficient of a_{n-2} is Fib(2m-1), perhaps.

Wait for m=0:

Coeff a_{n-1} is 1, coeff a_{n-2} is 0.

m=1: 1, 1.

m=2: 2, 1.

m=3: 3, 2.

m=4:5,3.

m=5:8,5.

Yes. So the coefficients are Fib(m+1) and Fib(m), but perhaps not. Wait, let's see:

The sequence for coefficients of a_{n-1} is 1,1,2,3,5,8... which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from index 1 (if Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.)

Similarly for a_{n-2} coefficients: 0,1,1,2,3,5... which is the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one.

So for m steps, Max(m) = Fib(2m) *a_{n-1} + Fib(2m-1)*a_{n-2} ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:

Wait for m=1, the max is a_{n-1} +a_{n-2} → Fib(2) =1, Fib(1)=1. So 1*a_{n-1} +1*a_{n-2} → yes.

For m=2: 2a_{n-1} +a_{n-2}. Fib(3)=2, Fib(2)=1. So 2*a_{n-1} +1*a_{n-2} → yes.

For m=3:3a +2a_prev. Fib(4)=3, Fib(3)=2 → yes.

So it seems that Max(m) = Fib(2m) *a_{n-1} + Fib(2m-1)*a_{n-2}.

Wait, but for m=0: Fib(0) is 0, Fib(-1) is undefined. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are Fib(m+1) and Fib(m) for a_{n-1} and a_{n-2}, respectively.

But for m=0: Fib(0+1) =1, Fib(0) =0 → 1*a_{n-1} +0*a_{n-2} → correct.

m=1: Fib(2)=1, Fib(1)=1 → 1*a_{n-1} +1*a_{n-2} → correct.

m=2: Fib(3)=2, Fib(2)=1 → 2*a_{n-1} +1*a_{n-2} → correct.

Yes, that seems to fit. So Max(m) = Fib(m+1)*a_{n-1} + Fib(m)*a_{n-2}.

But wait, Fib(0) is 0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.

So for m steps, Max(m) = Fib(m+1) * a_{n-1} + Fib(m) * a_{n-2}.

This formula works for m>=0.

So for example:

m=0: Fib(1)*a_{n-1} + Fib(0)*a_{n-2} →1*a_{n-1} +0 → correct.

m=1: Fib(2)*a_{n-1} + Fib(1)*a_{n-2} →1*a_{n-1} +1*a_{n-2} → correct.

Yes.

So this is a key insight. The maximum after m steps can be computed as Fib(m+1)*a_{n-1} + Fib(m)*a_{n-2}.

But wait, what if n=1? Because the problem states n can be 1. Let's see:

In the problem statement, n >=1.

If n=1, then the original array has a single element. After any number of steps, since there are no adjacent pairs, no new elements are added. So for n=1, the array length remains 1. So after x steps, the array is still [a0], sum remains a0. Then after sorting (no change), then y steps also no change. So sum is a0 mod p.

But in the case of n=1, the code needs to handle that.

But the formula for max and min when n=1 would require a_{n-1} =a0, and a_{n-2} would be undefined. So for n=1, the max is a0, the min is a0. So in the case when n=1, the sum after x steps is computed via the formula, and then after sorting, sum_B is the same. Then, for y steps, sum_C is sum_B *3^y - (a0 +a0)/2*(3^y -1). But wait, for n=1, during steps, no elements are added, so sum remains the same. But according to the formula for S(m), when n=1, a0 +a_{n-1} = a0 +a0=2a0. The sum after m steps is sum_initial *3^m - (2a0/2)*(3^m -1) = a0*3^m - a0*(3^m-1) = a0*3^m -a0*3^m +a0 = a0. Which is correct. So the formula works for n=1.

But back to the case when n >=2. So the maximum after m steps is Fib(m+1)*a_{n-1} + Fib(m)*a_{n-2}.

The minimum after m steps is a0.

So this gives us the key to compute min_x and max_x after x steps.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Compute sum_x = S(x) using the formula: sum_initial *3^x - (a0 +a_{n-1})/2 * (3^x -1).

2. Compute min_x = a0.

3. Compute max_x = Fib(x+1)*a_{n-1} + Fib(x)*a_{n-2} (if n >=2, else a0).

Then, after sorting, the array B has sum sum_x, min B0 = a0 (since the array is sorted and the original a0 is the minimum, and all other elements are >= a0), and max B_last = max_x.

But wait, when the array after x steps is sorted, the maximum element is the max of all elements in the array after x steps, which is max_x. So yes, the max after sorting is max_x, and the min is a0.

Thus, when we proceed to compute the sum after y steps on the sorted array B, we can use the same formula:

sum_C = 3^y * sum_x - (a0 + max_x)/2 * (3^y -1).

So the total sum after x+y steps is sum_C.

But we need to compute all of this modulo p.

Now, the challenge is to compute:

- sum_initial: sum of the original array, modulo p.

- compute 3^x mod (something, but possibly not needed here).

Wait, sum_x is computed as (sum_initial * 3^x) mod p, but wait no. The formula for S(x) is:

sum_x = (sum_initial * 3^x) - (a0 + a_{n-1})/2 * (3^x -1).

But since we are working modulo p, we need to handle divisions by 2. So the term (a0 + a_{n-1})/2 must be computed as (a0 + a_{n-1}) multiplied by the modular inverse of 2 modulo p.

But 2 and p may not be coprime. Wait, the problem says p can be up to 1e9. But if p is even, then 2 and p are not coprime, and the inverse doesn't exist. But this would imply that (a0 +a_{n-1}) must be even, otherwise division by 2 is impossible. But how can we handle this?

Wait, the formula for sum_x is derived under the assumption that the array after x steps is the one generated by inserting elements. But in reality, the sum is an integer. Because all elements inserted are sums of integers, so the sum is an integer.

Thus, when the formula involves division by 2, the numerator must be even, ensuring that the result is an integer. But when working modulo p, how do we handle this?

We need to compute ( (a0 + a_{n-1}) / 2 ) * (3^x -1) mod p. So for this term to be an integer, (3^x -1) must be multiplied by (a0 +a_{n-1}) which is even.

But why is (a0 +a_{n-1}) even? Because after x steps, the array's elements are all integers (since each inserted element is a sum of two previous elements). The sum after x steps is the sum of all elements, which is an integer. According to the formula sum_x = sum_initial *3^x - (a0 +a_{n-1})/2 * (3^x -1), sum_x must be an integer. So (a0 +a_{n-1}) must be even.

But this is not necessarily true. Wait, what if a0 +a_{n-1} is odd? Then the term (a0 +a_{n-1})/2 would be a half-integer, but multiplied by (3^x -1), which is even (since 3^x is odd, 3^x -1 is even). So (even) * (half-integer) = integer. So the formula sum_x is indeed an integer.

Thus, (a0 +a_{n-1})/2 * (3^x -1) can be computed as ( (a0 +a_{n-1}) * (3^x -1) ) / 2.

But how to compute this modulo p when p is even?

We need to find a way to compute this division by 2 modulo p. Since the overall expression must be an integer, (a0 +a_{n-1}) * (3^x -1) must be even, so it is divisible by 2. Therefore, modulo p, we can compute this as ( (a0 +a_{n-1}) * (3^x -1) ) // 2 mod p. But how to compute this when working with mod p?

We can compute it as ( (a0 +a_{n-1}) mod p ) * ( (3^x -1) mod (2p) ) // 2 mod p.

Alternatively, compute the product (a0 +a_{n-1}) * (3^x -1) mod 2p. Then divide by 2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the term as follows:

term = ( ( (a0 +a_{n-1}) % (2*p) ) * ( (pow(3, x, 2*p) -1) % (2*p) ) ) // 2 ) % p.

Because (a0 +a_{n-1})*(3^x-1) is divisible by 2, so when we compute the product modulo 2p, the result will be congruent to 0 mod 2. Then, dividing by 2 gives an integer modulo p.

This is a possible approach.

So for the sum_x:

sum_x = ( sum_initial * pow(3, x, p) ) % p

minus

( ( (a0 +a_{n-1}) * (pow(3, x, 2*p) -1) ) // 2 ) % p 

But how to handle this correctly.

Alternatively, compute the entire term modulo p*2 to handle even division.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think differently.

We can compute the term as:

term = ((a0 + a_{n-1}) * (pow(3, x, 2*p) -1)) // 2 mod p.

But since (a0 +a_{n-1})*(pow(3, x, 2p) -1) is even, the division by 2 is possible.

But how to compute this in code.

Alternatively, compute the product modulo 2p, then divide by 2, and then take modulo p.

Yes.

So steps:

1. Compute a_sum = (a0 + a_{n-1}) mod (2*p).

2. Compute three_pow_x = pow(3, x, 2*p).

3. Compute three_pow_x_minus_1 = (three_pow_x -1) % (2*p).

4. Compute product = (a_sum * three_pow_x_minus_1) % (2*p).

5. product is even, so divide by 2 → product_div_2 = product // 2.

6. term = product_div_2 % p.

Then, sum_x_mod_p = ( (sum_initial % p) * pow(3, x, p) ) % p - term % p.

But since the term is subtracted, need to handle negative values mod p.

So sum_x_mod_p = ( (sum_initial * pow(3, x, p)) % p - term ) % p.

But sum_initial is sum of the original array, which can be computed modulo p.

So sum_initial_mod_p = sum( a_i ) mod p.

Thus, sum_x_mod_p = (sum_initial_mod_p * pow(3, x, p)) % p.

Then subtract the term, mod p.

So sum_x_mod_p = ( (sum_initial_mod_p * pow(3, x, p)) % p - term ) % p.

But sum_x_mod_p can be negative, so add p and mod p again.

Now, moving to the next part: after x steps, the sum is sum_x_mod_p, and the sorted array has sum sum_x_mod_p. The new array B is the sorted array after x steps. The first element of B is a0 (since it's the min), and the last element is max_x.

Then, after y steps, the sum is computed as:

sum_total = (sum_x * 3^y) - (a0 + max_x)/2 * (3^y -1).

But again, need to compute this modulo p.

So sum_total_mod_p = ( (sum_x_mod_p * pow(3, y, p)) % p - term_y ) % p.

Where term_y is ( (a0 + max_x) * (pow(3, y, 2*p) -1 ) // 2 ) % p.

But again, a0 + max_x must be even multiplied by (3^y -1), which is even if y >=1. But wait, for y=0, 3^0=1, 3^0-1=0. So term_y is zero. For y>=1, (3^y -1) is even.

Wait, 3^y is odd for any y, so 3^y-1 is even. So (a0 + max_x) * (3^y -1) is even, since (3^y -1) is even. Thus, (a0 + max_x) can be even or odd, but multiplied by even gives even.

Thus, (a0 + max_x) * (3^y -1) is even, so division by 2 is valid.

Thus, to compute term_y:

Compute a0_plus_max_x = (a0 + max_x) mod (2*p).

Compute three_pow_y = pow(3, y, 2*p).

three_pow_y_minus_1 = (three_pow_y -1) mod (2*p).

product_y = (a0_plus_max_x * three_pow_y_minus_1) mod (2*p).

product_y_div_2 = product_y // 2.

term_y_mod_p = product_y_div_2 % p.

Then, sum_total_mod_p = ( (sum_x_mod_p * pow(3, y, p)) % p - term_y_mod_p ) % p.

But this is correct only if the term is computed as ( (a0 + max_x) / 2 ) * (3^y -1) mod p.

Now, the problem is how to compute max_x.

max_x is Fib(x+1) * a_{n-1} + Fib(x) *a_{n-2} if n >=2. For n=1, max_x is a0.

So we need to compute Fib(x) and Fib(x+1) modulo 2*p.

But Fib(x) can be huge. x is up to 1e18.

Thus, we need an efficient way to compute Fib(x) mod m, where m is 2*p.

This can be done using matrix exponentiation or fast doubling.

The fast doubling method allows us to compute Fib(n) mod m in O(log n) time.

So for n >=2:

max_x = Fib(x+1) * a_{n-1} + Fib(x) *a_{n-2} mod 2*p.

But why mod 2*p? Because when we compute (a0 + max_x) in the term_y, this is multiplied by (3^y -1) mod 2*p, then divided by 2, and mod p.

So a0 + max_x can be up to (a0 + ... ) and mod 2*p is sufficient.

So for n >=2:

Compute Fib(x) mod (2*p), Fib(x+1) mod (2*p).

max_x = (Fib(x+1) * a_{n-1} + Fib(x) * a_{n-2}) ) mod (2*p).

Then, a0_plus_max_x = (a0 + max_x) mod (2*p).

For n=1:

max_x = a0 → a0_plus_max_x = 2a0 mod (2*p).

So the steps are:

If n >=2:

Compute Fib(x) mod (2*p) and Fib(x+1) mod (2*p).

max_x = ( Fib(x+1) * a_{n-1} + Fib(x) * a_{n-2} ) mod (2*p).

Else (n=1):

max_x = a0.

Thus, the code needs to handle n=1 and n>=2 cases.

So putting it all together:

The steps are:

1. Read n, x, y, p, and the array a.

2. Compute sum_initial_mod_p = sum(a) mod p.

3. Compute the sum after x steps, sum_x_mod_p.

   a. Compute a0 = a[0], a_n_minus_1 = a[-1] if n >=1.

   b. Compute a_sum = (a0 + a_n_minus_1) mod (2*p).

   c. Compute three_pow_x_mod_2p = pow(3, x, 2*p).

   d. three_pow_x_minus_1_mod_2p = (three_pow_x_mod_2p -1) % (2*p).

   e. product_x = (a_sum * three_pow_x_minus_1_mod_2p) % (2*p).

   f. term_x = (product_x // 2) % p.

   g. sum_x_mod_p = ( (sum_initial_mod_p * pow(3, x, p)) % p - term_x ) % p.

4. Compute max_x mod (2*p).

   a. If n ==1:

      max_x = a0 mod (2*p).

   else:

      compute Fib(x) mod (2*p) and Fib(x+1) mod (2*p).

      a_{n-2} = a[-2] if n >=2.

      max_x = ( Fib(x+1) * a_n_minus_1 + Fib(x) * a_{n-2} ) mod (2*p).

5. Compute a0_plus_max_x = (a0 + max_x) mod (2*p).

6. Compute the sum after y steps on the sorted array:

   a. Compute three_pow_y_mod_2p = pow(3, y, 2*p).

   b. three_pow_y_minus_1_mod_2p = (three_pow_y_mod_2p -1) % (2*p).

   c. product_y = (a0_plus_max_x * three_pow_y_minus_1_mod_2p) % (2*p).

   d. term_y = (product_y //2 ) % p.

   e. sum_total_mod_p = ( (sum_x_mod_p * pow(3, y, p)) % p - term_y ) % p.

7. The answer is (sum_total_mod_p + p) % p to ensure non-negative.

Now, the key part is implementing the fast doubling method to compute Fib(x) mod m, where m=2*p.

Implementing fast doubling in Python.

The fast doubling method allows to compute Fib(n) and Fib(n+1) in O(log n) time.

Here's how it works:

def fib_fast_doubling(n, m):
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    a, b = fib_fast_doubling(n >> 1, m)
    c = a * ( ( 2*b - a ) % m )
    d = (a*a + b*b) % m
    if n & 1:
        return (d, (c + d) % m )
    else:
        return (c, d)

But I'll need to return Fib(n) and Fib(n+1) mod m.

Wait, the fast doubling method for Fib(n) returns (Fib(n), Fib(n+1)).

So for example, fib_fast_doubling(5, m) would return (5, 8).

So for x steps, we need Fib(x) and Fib(x+1) mod (2*p).

So for n >=2, compute Fib(x) mod m and Fib(x+1) mod m, where m=2*p.

So, in code:

if n >=2:

    m = 2*p

    fib_x, fib_x_plus_1 = fib_fast_doubling(x, m)

    max_x = (fib_x_plus_1 * a_n_minus_1 + fib_x * a_n_minus_2) % m

else:

    max_x = a0 % m

Now, implementing the fib_fast_doubling function.

Once that is handled, the rest is modular arithmetic.

But for x up to 1e18, this is manageable.

Now, handling n=1.

So for n=1, after x steps, the array remains the same. So sum_x_mod_p is computed as per the formula, which for n=1 is sum_initial *3^x - (2a0/2)(3^x-1) → sum_initial*3^x -a0 (3^x-1).

sum_initial is a0.

So sum_x = a0*3^x -a0*(3^x-1) = a0*(3^x -3^x +1) = a0.

Which is correct, as for n=1, no elements are added.

Thus, the code should handle this correctly.

Now, let's test with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

2 1 0 657276545

1 2

n=2, x=1, y=0, p=657276545.

Original array is [1,2].

sum_initial = 3.

sum_x = 3*3^1 - (1+2)/2*(3^1-1) = 9 - (3/2)*(2) =9-3=6 → mod p is 6.

But y=0, so sum_total_mod_p is sum_x_mod_p =6.

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

2 1 1 888450282

1 2.

After x=1 step, sum_x is 6. Then sorted array is [1,2,3], sum remains 6.

Wait, no. Wait after x=1 step:

Original array is [1,2]. After 1 step, the array becomes [1,3,2,5,2]. Wait no, wait:

Wait for n=2, original array [a0, a1], which is [1,2].

After 1 step, new array is [a0, a0+a1, a1, a1 +a2? No, since n=2, the array is [1, 3, 2]. Because between 1 and 2, we insert 3. So the array after x=1 step is [1,3,2]. So sum_x is 1+3+2=6.

Then the sorted array is [1,2,3], sum is 6.

Then y=1 step. So during y=1 step:

The array is [1,2,3]. Inserting between each pair:

1 and 2 → insert 3. New array becomes [1,3,2,5,3]. Sum is 1+3+2+5+3=14.

Which matches the sample output.

But according to the formula for sum_after_y steps:

sum_B =6.

max_x after x steps is max_x = Fib(2)*a1 + Fib(1)*a0 → Fib(2) is 1, a1 is 2, Fib(1) is 1, a0 is 1 → 1*2 +1*1=3. So a0 +max_x is 1+3=4.

term_y = (4 * (3^1-1 )) /2 = 4 * 2 /2=4.

sum_after_y =6*3^1 -4= 18-4=14.

Which is correct.

So the code should compute this correctly.

Thus, the approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this in Python:

Implement the fib_fast_doubling function.

Handle all the steps, including cases when n=1.

But also note that when x is zero, then sum_x is sum_initial, and the array is the original array. So when x=0, the array is sorted again (as per the problem statement), but since the original array was already sorted, no change. Then y steps are computed on the original array sorted.

Similarly for y=0, the sum is sum_x_mod_p.

Now, the code.

First, read the input.

Read n, x, y, p.

Read a as a list.

sum_initial = sum(a)

sum_initial_mod_p = sum_initial % p.

a0 = a[0]

if n >=2:

    a_n_minus_1 = a[-1]

    a_n_minus_2 = a[-2]

else:

    a_n_minus_1 = a0

    a_n_minus_2 = 0 # irrelevant.

Compute sum_x_mod_p:

Compute a_sum = (a0 + a_n_minus_1) mod (2*p).

Compute three_pow_x_mod_2p = pow(3, x, 2*p).

three_pow_x_minus_1_mod_2p = (three_pow_x_mod_2p -1) % (2*p)

product_x = (a_sum * three_pow_x_minus_1_mod_2p) % (2*p)

term_x = (product_x //2 ) % p

sum_x_mod_p = (sum_initial_mod_p * pow(3, x, p)) % p

sum_x_mod_p = (sum_x_mod_p - term_x) % p

sum_x_mod_p = (sum_x_mod_p + p) % p

Then compute max_x:

if n ==1:

    max_x = a0 % (2*p)

else:

    m = 2*p

    # compute Fib(x) and Fib(x+1) mod m.

    def fast_doubling(n, mod):

        def multiply(a, b):

            # a is (f1, f2), b is (f3, f4)

            return ( (a[0]*(b[1] - b[0]) + a[1]*b[0]) ) % mod, (a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1]) % mod )

        def helper(n):

            if n == 0:

                return (0, 1)

            f_prev, f_curr = helper(n >>1)

            f_2prev = f_prev * ( 2 * f_curr - f_prev ) % mod

            f_2curr = ( f_prev**2 + f_curr**2 ) % mod

            if n & 1:

                return ( f_2curr, (f_2prev + f_2curr) % mod )

            else:

                return ( f_2prev, f_2curr )

        return helper(n)[0]

    # Or use another implementation.

    # Using fast doubling to compute Fib(n) and Fib(n+1).

    def fib(n, mod):

        if n ==0:

            return (0, 1)

        a, b = fib(n >>1, mod)

        c = ( a * ( 2*b - a ) ) % mod

        d = ( a*a + b*b ) % mod

        if n & 1:

            return (d, (c +d) % mod )

        else:

            return (c, d)

    # Compute Fib(x) and Fib(x+1).

    # Fib(x) is the first element of the tuple, Fib(x+1) is the second.

    # For example, Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1.

    fib_x, fib_x_plus_1 = fib(x, m)

    max_x = (fib_x_plus_1 * a_n_minus_1 + fib_x * a_n_minus_2 ) % m

Then, a0_plus_max_x = (a0 + max_x) % (2*p)

Compute the term_y:

three_pow_y_mod_2p = pow(3, y, 2*p)

three_pow_y_minus_1_mod_2p = (three_pow_y_mod_2p -1) % (2*p)

product_y = (a0_plus_max_x * three_pow_y_minus_1_mod_2p) % (2*p)

term_y = (product_y //2 ) % p

sum_total_mod_p = (sum_x_mod_p * pow(3, y, p)) % p

sum_total_mod_p = (sum_total_mod_p - term_y) % p

sum_total_mod_p = (sum_total_mod_p + p) % p

Print sum_total_mod_p.

Now, let's test this code with the sample input.

Sample 1:

n=2, x=1, y=0, p=657276545

a = [1,2]

sum_initial = 3 mod p is 3.

a_sum = 1+2=3 mod 2*p is 3.

three_pow_x_mod_2p = 3^1 mod 657276545*2 =3.

three_pow_x_minus_1_mod_2p =2.

product_x =3*2=6 mod 1314553090 is 6.

term_x =6//2=3 mod p is3.

sum_x_mod_p =3*3 mod p -3 =9-3=6 mod p.

y=0:

three_pow_y_mod_2p=1.

three_pow_y_minus_1=0.

product_y=0.

term_y=0.

sum_total_mod_p=6*1 -0=6.

Output is 6.

Sample 2:

n=2, x=1, y=1, p=888450282.

sum_x_mod_p is6.

For max_x:

m=2*888450282=1776900564.

Compute Fib(1) and Fib(2).

x=1, so Fib(1) is1, Fib(2) is1.

max_x=1*2 +1*1=3 mod m is3.

a0_plus_max_x =1+3=4 mod m.

three_pow_y=3^1=3 mod m is3.

three_pow_y_minus_1=2.

product_y=4*2=8 mod m.

term_y=8//2=4 mod p.

sum_total_mod_p=6 *3^1 mod p →6*3=18 mod p is18.

18 -4=14 mod p.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code should handle these cases.

Another sample:

Sample 3:

Input:

4 5 0 10000

1 2 3 4.

sum_initial =1+2+3+4=10.

x=5.

sum_x =10 *3^5 - (1+4)/2*(3^5-1).

3^5=243.

sum_x=10*243 - (5/2)*(242) →2430 - (5*242/2) →2430 - 605= 1825.

Mod 10000 is 1825.

y=0, so output is 1825.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code works.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But in Python, for very large exponents, the pow function can handle exponents up to 1e18.

Implement the fib function using fast doubling.

Here's the code.
