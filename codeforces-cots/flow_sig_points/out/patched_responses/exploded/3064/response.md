Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum possible value of S, which is the sum of mex for all pairs of nodes u < v. The mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present on the path between u and v. The tree is given, and the edges are labeled with distinct integers from 0 to n-2. So the problem is to assign these labels in such a way that the sum S is maximized.

Hmm, the mex concept here is tricky. Let me think about how mex works. For a path between two nodes, the mex is the smallest missing number in the edge labels along that path. So, for example, if all edges on the path are labeled 0 and 1, the mex would be 2. If the path includes 0,1,2, the mex is 3.

But to maximize S, we need as many pairs as possible to have a higher mex. But how can we arrange the edge labels to achieve this?

I remember that in some mex problems, the key is to structure the problem such that certain edges are critical. For trees, each edge's removal splits the tree into two components. Maybe edges with higher labels should be placed in a way that their removal affects a large number of pairs.

Wait, maybe the optimal strategy is to arrange the edges such that for each edge with label k, it's part of exactly (k+1) * (remaining nodes) paths. Or something along those lines. Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this using the concept of critical edges for certain mex values.

Let me think: the mex of a path is k if and only if the path contains all labels 0, 1, ..., k-1 and does not contain k. So to maximize the sum, for each possible k, we want as many pairs as possible to have mex equal to k. The maximum possible mex for any path is the number of edges in the path. Wait, no. If the edges along a path are labeled 0,1,2, then mex is 3. So if the path has m edges, the mex can be up to m. But if the labels are not contiguous, the mex could be lower.

But how to structure the edge labels to maximize the sum. Let's consider the problem where each k contributes to the sum by the number of pairs (u, v) where mex(u, v) is at least k. Because sum_{mex} mex is equal to sum_{k >=0} the number of pairs with mex >k} (since mex is the sum over k from 0 to mex-1 of 1). Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to compute S by considering for each k, how many pairs have mex greater than k. Because mex(u, v) is the smallest missing, so for each k, the number of pairs with mex >k is equal to the number of pairs where all numbers 0..k are present in their path. Then S is the sum over k >=0 of the number of pairs where all 0..k are present in their path.

Wait, that's a key insight. Because mex(u, v) is the smallest missing number, so for each k, mex(u, v) >k if and only if all numbers 0 to k are present in the path between u and v. Therefore, the sum S is equal to the sum for all k >=0 of the number of pairs (u, v) whose path includes all edges labeled 0, 1, ..., k.

So, to compute S, we can for each k, compute the number of pairs (u, v) whose path contains all edges labeled 0,1,...,k, and then sum all these counts for k from 0 up to n-2 (since the labels are up to n-2). But how can we arrange the edge labels to maximize this sum?

The idea is to arrange the edges such that higher k's have as many pairs as possible that include all edges 0..k. So for each k, the more pairs that include all edges 0..k, the higher the sum.

So, the problem reduces to selecting a set of edges (each labeled 0,1,...,m for some m) such that their inclusion in a path implies that the pair contributes to the count for k up to m.

But how to assign the labels to edges to maximize this.

Wait, the maximum possible sum S would be achieved when, for each k, the edges labeled 0,1,...,k form a structure that is a path. Because then, any pair that requires passing through this entire path would have their mex higher than k. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the edges labeled 0 to k should form a structure such that the number of pairs that have their path containing all these edges is as large as possible.

Alternatively, for each edge e, the label assigned to e will determine which k's it contributes to. For example, an edge labeled 0 will be part of all k >=0. If a pair's path includes edge 0, then for k=0, that pair contributes 1 to the sum. For k=1, if the pair's path includes edges 0 and 1, then it contributes 1 for k=0 and 1, etc.

Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to find a way to arrange the edges such that for each k, the edges labeled 0 to k form a connected subtree. Then, the number of pairs that include all these edges is (size of the subtree) choose 2, but wait, maybe not. Because the pairs in the subtree would have paths that might not include all the edges in the 0..k set.

Alternatively, the edges labeled 0 to k form a spanning tree on some subset. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think differently.

Suppose that the labels are arranged in such a way that the edges labeled 0 to k form a structure where each edge labeled i is part of a chain. For example, edge 0 is a bridge between two components, edge 1 is a bridge in one of those components, etc. This way, any path that crosses edge 0 must include edge 0, and any path that includes edges 0 and 1 must cross those bridges.

Wait, the key here is that for a pair (u, v) to have their path include all edges 0..k, their u and v must be in different components when we remove all edges 0..k. Or perhaps, when the edges 0..k are arranged as a sequence of bridges. For example, imagine the tree is a chain, and the edges are labeled 0,1,2,... in order. Then, the edges 0..k form a subchain. Any pair of nodes that are on opposite ends of the entire chain would include all edges 0..k in their path, but only if k is the last edge in their path.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of edge labels and their criticality. The maximum sum S is achieved when the edges are arranged in such a way that each edge labeled i is part of as many paths as possible that require all edges 0..i. So for each edge i, it's important to maximize the number of pairs (u, v) whose path includes all edges 0..i.

Alternatively, for each edge e, the higher the label, the more paths will have their mex increase. Wait, perhaps the best way is to model this as the sum over k of the number of pairs of nodes whose paths include all edges labeled 0..k. So, to maximize this sum, we need to arrange the edges such that the number of such pairs is maximized for each possible k.

So how do we arrange the edges? Let's think of building the tree step by step. Start with a tree. Assign label 0 to an edge that, when removed, splits the tree into two components of sizes a and b. Then, the number of pairs that must cross this edge (and thus include label 0) is a*b. For label 0, the contribution to the sum is the number of such pairs. For label 1, the contribution is the number of pairs that cross edges 0 and 1, and so on.

Wait, but for a pair to contribute to k=0, they just need to include edge 0. For k=1, they need to include edges 0 and 1. For k=2, they need to include 0,1,2. So the sum S is the sum over all k of the number of pairs that include all edges 0..k in their path.

So, the problem reduces to selecting edges to assign labels 0, 1, 2, ... such that the product of the sizes of the components when those edges are removed (or some similar measure) is maximized. Because each edge's label affects how many pairs of nodes will include all edges up to that label in their path.

Wait, here's an idea. For the edge labeled 0, the number of pairs that include it is a*b, where a and b are the sizes of the two components when the edge is removed. For the edge labeled 1, when considering the remaining edges (after 0 is removed), the next edge (label 1) should be in such a way that the product of the components after removing it (from the remaining tree) is as large as possible. But this process continues recursively.

So, the optimal way is to select edges in a way that each step (assigning label k) chooses the edge whose removal in the current tree splits it into two parts with the maximum possible product of their sizes. Then, for each label k, the product is multiplied by the previous splits. This way, the sum S will be the sum of the products for each k.

Wait, let's think with the first example. The tree is a chain of 3 nodes. The edges are 1-2 and 2-3. When we assign label 0 to the edge between 1 and 2, removing it splits into components of size 1 and 2. The product is 1*2=2. Then, the next edge (label 1) is between 2 and 3. Removing it splits into 2 and 1. Product is 1*1=1. So the sum is 2 (for k=0) + 1 (for k=1) = 3. Which matches the example. But in that example, the output is 3. So this approach seems to fit.

Another example: the second sample input. The tree is a star with center 1 connected to 2,3,4, and 3 connected to 5. Assigning labels in a way that each step splits the tree into components with maximum product. Let's see:

First, which edge to choose for label 0. The possible edges are (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 3-5). Let's calculate the product for each:

If we pick edge 1-3 (connecting 1 and 3), removing it splits into a component containing 1 (size 3: 1, 2,4) and 3's component (size 2:3 and 5). The product is 3*2=6. Alternatively, if we pick edge 3-5, removing it splits into 4 and 1 (since the component would be 5 (size 1) and the rest 4). Product 4*1=4. For edge 1-2: product is 1*4=4. For edge 1-4: same as 1-2, 1*4=4. So the maximum is 6. So we choose edge 1-3 for label 0. Then, the sum for k=0 is 3*2=6.

Next, for label 1, we need to split the remaining edges. Now, the tree after removing edge 1-3 (label 0) is split into two parts. So the edges left are the ones not yet labeled. Wait, no. Wait, the labels are assigned to edges, and the process is to select edges in order, each time choosing the edge whose removal in the current tree (composed of the remaining edges) gives the maximum product. But how does this work?

Wait, maybe the approach is to model the edges as a sequence of bridges. Each time, we select the edge that, when removed, splits the current tree into two components with maximum product. Then, we assign label k to that edge, and then proceed recursively on the two resulting subtrees. But the labels are assigned in order 0,1,2,... So for label 0, we select the edge whose removal gives the maximum product. Then, for label 1, we process the two components from the previous split. For each of those components, we again select the edge in that component whose removal gives the maximum product. And so on.

This way, each split contributes to the sum S by the product of the sizes of the split, and recursively, each subsequent split in the components contributes their own products.

So the sum S is the sum of all these products for each split. Because, each time you split a component of size s into a and b (a + b = s), the product a*b is added to S once for each k up to the current label. Wait, no. Wait, when you split a component into a and b, the product a*b is the number of pairs of nodes that are split by this edge. These pairs will include all edges from previous splits (the ones with lower labels) and this current edge. So the sum S is the sum of a*b for each edge, where the edge is processed in the order of labels 0, 1, 2, etc.

Yes, because each split edge (labeled k) contributes a*b pairs that cross it, and all these pairs will have their path include all edges labeled 0 to k. Because those edges are higher in the hierarchy. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, how do the labels affect the inclusion in the paths?

But according to the earlier model, each split edge is part of the sequence. For example, when you split the tree into a and b with edge 0, then in the next step, each of a and b are split again with edges 1 and 2, etc. So the pairs that cross edge 0 must include that edge in their path. The pairs that cross edges 0 and 1 are those that are split by both edges. So the sum S is the sum of all the a*b products for each edge in the order they are chosen (i.e., their label). Because each edge's a*b represents the number of pairs that include this edge and all previous edges in their path.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each edge is part of the path for exactly a*b pairs, and since the edges are chosen in order (label 0, then 1, etc.), each such pair will contribute 1 to the sum for each k up to the edge's label. Therefore, the total sum S is the sum over all edges of the product a*b, multiplied by the number of times they are counted. Wait, no. Because when you select an edge, the a*b pairs are those that are split by that edge. These pairs will have their paths include all edges along the path from their split. So for example, if an edge is labeled 0, then all pairs split by it contribute to k=0. If another edge is labeled 1, then the pairs split by it (and not split by edge 0) would contribute to k=1. Wait, maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum S is exactly equal to the sum of the a*b products for each edge chosen in the order of labels 0,1,2,... So for each edge labeled k, the a*b product is added to the sum S once. But according to the earlier example:

First sample:

Edges split as 1-2 (size split 1 and 2, product 2) and 2-3 (split 2 into 1 and 1, product 1). Sum is 2+1=3. Which matches the sample.

Second sample:

After splitting the initial tree (n=5) into 3 and 2 (product 3*2=6). Then split the 3 into 2 and 1 (product 2*1=2). Then split the 2 into 1 and 1 (product 1*1=1). Then split the 2 (the other component) into 1 and 1 (product 1*1=1). Then split one of the 1s, but perhaps there are no more edges. So the sum would be 6+2+1+1=10, which matches the sample. Because the edges are labeled in the order of splitting which gives the maximum product each time.

So this seems to fit. Therefore, the approach is to find the maximum possible sum of a*b for each split, where each split is chosen greedily to split the current component into two parts with maximum possible product. Then, the sum of all these a*b values gives the maximum possible S.

So the problem reduces to selecting edges in such a way that each split (edge removal) is chosen to maximize the product of the sizes of the resulting components, and the sum of all these products is the answer.

Now, the question is, how to compute this sum given a tree. This approach is similar to the problem of decomposing the tree into a sequence of splits, each time choosing the edge that maximizes the product of the component sizes. The sum of all these products is the answer.

So the algorithm is:

1. For each edge in the tree, compute the product of the sizes of the two components that would result from removing that edge. The order in which we process these edges (i.e., the labels) is determined by the priority of their products. We need to select edges in a way that, at each step, we choose the edge with the maximum possible product of the current component's split.

Wait, but the components are part of the tree. For example, when you split the tree into a and b, then the next splits are within a and within b, and so on. So the process is recursive.

This sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a priority queue. At each step, we have a set of connected components. For each component, we can find the best possible split (edge that, when removed, gives maximum product), and add those edges to a priority queue. Then, the highest product edge in the queue is selected next, split into two components, and the process repeats until all edges are processed.

But how to compute the size of the components when splitting each possible edge?

Wait, perhaps the key is to precompute for each edge the size of the subtree that it splits the tree into. For example, for each edge (u, v), when you remove it, the tree is split into two parts. The size of the subtree that's connected to u (if we consider the parent of u as the other part) can be computed via a post-order traversal.

So the steps would be:

- Compute for each edge the size of one of the two components when the edge is removed. Let's call this the "subtree size" for the edge.

- The product for that edge is then (subtree_size) * (n - subtree_size).

Once all edges have their product computed, we need to select the edges in an order that allows us to accumulate the maximum sum. However, the order in which we split affects the size of the components for subsequent splits.

Wait, no. Because once an edge is split, the components are divided into two parts. The next splits are within each of those components. For example, when you split a component of size s into a and b (a + b = s), then any subsequent splits within a or b will have their products a' * (a - a') or similar.

But the problem is that the order in which edges are split (assigned labels) affects the product of the splits. So how can we model this optimally?

This sounds like a problem where the maximum sum is achieved by greedily selecting, at each step, the split (edge) that gives the maximum possible product of the current component's split.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) with all edges, each with their product computed as (s * (n - s)), where s is the size of one subtree when the edge is removed.

Then, while there are edges left to process:

- Extract the edge with the maximum product from the priority queue.

- Add the product to the sum S.

- Split the component into two parts. For each of these two parts (if they have size >=2, since a component of size 1 has no edges to split), compute the maximum possible product of splits for their edges and add them to the priority queue.

Wait, but how do we track which edges are in which component? Because after splitting, each component is a subtree, and the edges in each component are those that belong to the subtree. So perhaps, during the splitting process, we need to track the available edges in each component.

But this seems complicated. How can we model this?

Alternative approach: For each edge, when it is split, the two new components are processed, and the edges within each component are considered for the next splits. But how to model the edges in each component.

An alternative idea is to model each split as a process that divides the tree into a set of components. For each component, we need to find the best possible edge to split (the one with maximum product within that component). The priority queue would then track all possible edges that are candidates for splitting, considering their current component's size.

But how to compute the product for an edge in a component. For example, if a component has size m, then splitting an edge into a and b (a + b = m) gives a product a*b. But the component's size m is the sum of the two parts.

Wait, but when you split a component into a and b, the product is a*b. So, the key is that, for each split, the product is a*b, where a and b are the sizes of the two resulting components. Thus, for a given component, the maximum possible product is (floor(m/2) * ceil(m/2)), achieved when the split is as balanced as possible.

But in a tree, the actual splits depend on the structure. So to maximize the sum S, we need to split each component into the most balanced possible way. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to split each component into as balanced parts as possible, recursively. Thus, the sum S would be the sum of a*b for each split, where each split is as balanced as possible.

But how to model this for a given tree. For example, in the first sample, the splits are 1-2 (product 2) and 2-3 (product 1), sum 3. But if the tree were a chain of 4 nodes, the splits would be first splitting into 2 and 2 (product 4), then each of the two splits into 1 and 1 (product 1 each), sum 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

But how does this relate to the actual tree structure. The optimal sum is achieved when each split is as balanced as possible. So, for any tree, the maximum possible sum S is achieved by choosing, for each split, the edge that gives the most balanced split possible.

Therefore, the problem reduces to:

For each edge in the tree, compute the product (a * b) when the edge is split, then sum all those products in the order of the edges being split in the most balanced way possible.

Wait, but the order of splitting affects the a and b sizes. For example, if I split a component of size 5 into 3 and 2, then splitting the 3 into 2 and 1 (product 2) and the 2 into 1 and 1 (product 1). Sum is 3*2 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 6+2+1=9. Alternatively, if I split 5 into 4 and 1 (product 4*1=4), then split 4 into 2 and 2 (product 4) gives sum 4+4=8, which is less. So splitting in a balanced way gives a higher sum.

Thus, the optimal approach is to split each component into the most balanced possible parts, and recursively split those.

So, given a tree, the maximum sum S is the sum over all edges of the product of the sizes of the two components when the edge is split, but the order in which edges are split (i.e., the labels assigned) must be such that each split is chosen to be the most balanced possible at each step.

But how to compute this for a general tree. It seems that the problem is to find, for each possible edge in the tree, the product of the sizes when the edge is removed, and sum all these products. Wait, but that's not possible. Because when you split a component into a and b, the next splits are within a and b, which are separate.

Wait, perhaps the sum S is equal to the sum of the products for all edges in the tree, where each product is computed based on the sizes of the two components that result from removing that edge. But in the first example, the sum is 2 (from edge 1-2) + 1 (from edge 2-3) = 3. Which matches the answer.

In the second example, let's compute the product for each edge:

Edges are:

1-2: when removed, splits into 1 (node 2) and 4 others. product 1*4=4.

1-3: when removed, splits into 3 (nodes 1,2,4) and 2 (3,5). product 3*2=6.

1-4: when removed, product 1*4=4.

3-5: when removed, product 1*4=4.

Then, according to this approach, sum all products: 4+6+4+4=18. But the sample's output is 10. So that's not matching. So this idea is incorrect.

Hmm, this indicates that the sum is not just the sum of all edge products. So my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, but in the second sample, the answer is 10. So the sum of the products for the edges selected in the optimal order is 6 (from 3*2) + 2 (from 2*1) + 1 (from 1*1) + 1 (from 1*1) = 6+2+1+1=10. So this shows that the order in which edges are selected matters. The sum is not the sum of all edge products, but the sum of edge products selected in a certain order.

Thus, the correct approach is to process the edges in the order that gives the maximum possible sum of products, where each split is the best possible split for the current component.

So the algorithm must be:

Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) that contains for each current component the best possible edge to split (the one with maximum product). Start with the entire tree as one component. Then, for each step:

1. Extract the component with the largest possible product.

2. Split it into two parts, add their products to the sum.

3. For each new component (if size >=2), add their best possible edges to the priority queue.

But how to track the components and their best edges.

Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to finding a way to split the tree into edges, in such a way that at each step, the split with the largest possible product is chosen. The sum of all these products gives the maximum possible S.

So the approach is to model the problem as a greedy selection of splits, each time choosing the split (edge) with the largest possible product among all possible splits in the current set of components.

Thus, the steps are:

- For each possible edge in the tree, precompute the product of the sizes of the two components when that edge is removed. This is done once, during preprocessing.

- Then, use a max-heap (priority queue) to select edges in order of their product. Each time an edge is selected, the sum increases by its product. However, once an edge is selected, the tree is split into two components, and any edges within those components cannot contribute their own products until their components are split again. Wait, no. Because when a component is split into two parts, any edges within those parts are still part of the tree, but their product is computed based on the current component sizes. Wait, but once the tree is split into components, the edges within each component can only split that component further, not the others.

So the problem is that the initial product for an edge is computed based on the entire tree, but once some edges are split, the components are smaller, and the product for other edges may change. For example, consider a chain of 4 nodes: 1-2-3-4. The edge between 2 and 3 has a product of 2*2=4. If we split the edge between 1 and 2 (product 1*3=3), then the edge between 2 and 3 is now in a component of size 3 (nodes 2,3,4), and splitting that edge would split into 2 and 1 (product 2*1=2), not 2*2=4. So the product of the edges depends on the current component sizes, which change as we split edges.

Ah, so the initial approach of precomputing all edge products and selecting them in a global priority queue is incorrect, because the product depends on the current component sizes. Thus, this approach is not feasible.

So, the problem becomes more complex. How to track the current components and their possible splits, and compute the product of each possible split.

An efficient way to model this is needed. Let's think of the tree as a collection of components, which are subtrees. Each component has certain edges that are available to split it. When a component is split, the edges within it are divided into the two new components. For each component, we need to track the edges that can split it and their current product.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the splits as edges in a way that each split is part of a chain. For example, the first split is the edge that, when removed, has the largest product. Then, each of the resulting components is processed by selecting the edge with the largest product within that component, and so on. This way, the sum is the sum of all the split products, computed in this way.

But how to compute the product of each edge within each component as the splits proceed.

This requires dynamic computation of the component sizes as splits happen. But for a tree of size up to 3000, this could be manageable.

The approach would be:

1. Precompute for each edge the initial product when the entire tree is considered. Add all edges to a priority queue, with their product.

2. The priority queue is a max-heap based on the product.

3. Then, each time, we select the edge with the highest product. Add its product to the sum. Split the tree into two components. For each of the two components, compute the new products for their edges and add them to the priority queue.

But the problem is that, after splitting, the edges that were in the original component may now be in one of the two new components, and their product is now computed based on the new component's size.

However, the initial precomputation of the product for each edge is based on the entire tree, which is no longer valid once splits have occurred.

Thus, this approach is incorrect. So how can we dynamically track the product of each edge as the components split?

Alternative idea: For each edge, when it is split into two components, the product is determined by the size of the component that the edge is part of. For example, when you split a component of size m into a and b (a + b = m), any edge that's part of the a-component will have its product computed as (current a-component size) * (current a-component size - s), where s is the size of one of the parts when that edge is split.

But this requires, for each edge, to track which component it is currently in, and the size of that component.

But this seems complicated. How can we model this?

Perhaps the solution is to represent the tree as a collection of dynamic components. Each time a component is split, we track the size of the component. Then, for each edge, when it's split, the product is computed as a * (current component size - a), where a is the size of one part.

But how to compute a for an edge in a component of size m. This requires a way to find the size of the subtree when an edge is split within a component.

Hmm, perhaps using a union-find data structure isn't directly applicable here, since the splits are not unions but divisions. Alternative approach: For each edge, we can track the current size of the component it belongs to. But how.

Alternatively, for each edge, we can precompute its "subtree size" when it is removed from the original tree. Then, when the component that contains this edge is split into parts, the effective size for this edge is the size of the component that it's in. For example, suppose the original component is split into a and b. If the edge was part of a, then its product is computed as a' * (a - a'), where a' is the subtree size when split within the a-component.

But this is not correct. Because when the component is split into a and b, any further splits within a or b are based on their own subtree sizes, not the original tree.

Wait, perhaps the optimal sum is determined by recursively splitting each component into two parts with maximum possible product, regardless of the tree structure. For example, for a component of size m, the best possible split is into a and b where a is floor(m/2) and b is ceil(m/2). The sum would then be a*b + the sum for a and sum for b. This is the maximum possible sum for a component of size m. For example, for m=5, the sum would be 2*3 =6, then 1*2=2 and 1*1=1, total 6+2+1=9. Which is higher than other possible splits.

So the maximum possible sum is when each split is as balanced as possible. This is independent of the tree's actual structure. If this is true, then the answer is simply the sum of all possible splits for each component when split into the most balanced way possible, regardless of the tree's structure. But this contradicts the sample input. For example, in the first sample input, the tree is a chain of 3 nodes. The optimal sum is 3, which is (2*1)+(1*1)=2+1=3. Which matches the split into 2 and 1. But according to the balanced split approach, for m=3, the first split is 1 and 2, sum 2, then 1*1=1. Sum 3. Which is correct.

But in the second sample input, the sum is 10, which is 6 (split into 3 and 2) + 2 (split 3 into 2 and 1) +1 (split 2 into 1 and 1) +1 (split 2 into 1 and 1) =10. Which is the same as if the splits were as balanced as possible for each component.

But the tree's structure may allow for splits that are more balanced than others. For example, if the tree is a chain, the splits are forced to be as balanced as possible. But if the tree is a star, perhaps there are edges that allow for more balanced splits.

But the problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum S regardless of how the tree is structured. So the optimal sum depends on the tree's structure and the possible splits.

So the solution must find the sum of products of splits, where each split is chosen greedily as the one that gives the maximum possible product for the current component.

Thus, the problem is to model the tree as a collection of components and for each component, find the best possible split (edge that when removed gives the maximum product), then split it, add the product to the sum, and repeat until all edges are processed.

The challenge is to compute, for each component, the best possible split, which requires knowing the size of the two parts when each possible edge is removed from the component.

But how to compute this efficiently for each component.

Here's an approach:

1. For each edge in the original tree, precompute the size of the subtree when the edge is removed. This can be done via a post-order traversal. For each node u, compute the size of its subtree. For an edge connecting u and its parent, the subtree size for u is s, and the other part is n - s.

2. For each edge, store this subtree size s. The product is s * (n - s).

3. Then, use a priority queue that orders edges by their current product (s * (current component size - s)), but this requires knowing the current component size. Wait, but this is not directly possible. Because when a component is split into a and b, the edges within a are now part of a component of size a, and the product for splitting them is based on their subtree size within a.

This suggests that the initial approach is insufficient, as the product for an edge depends on the current component's size.

But this seems computationally expensive. For each edge, how can we track the current component size as splits are made.

Alternative idea: Each time a component is split into a and b, the edges in a are those that were in the original component and are part of the subtree a. So for each edge, we can precompute its subtree size in the original tree. Then, when the component is split into a and b, the edges in a have their subtree size within a.

For example, if an edge's original subtree size is s, and the component is split into a (size a), then if s is part of a, the subtree size within a is s. The other part is a - s. So the product is s * (a - s).

But how to track this for each edge. For example, when the component is split, the edges in that component are now in the new components, and their effective product is computed based on the new component size.

This suggests that for each edge, the effective product changes as components are split.

But how to model this efficiently.

Perhaps we can model each component as a tree, and for each component, we can keep track of the available edges and their current product. But maintaining this for all components is challenging.

Another approach is to note that each split (edge removal) contributes its product based on the current component size. So, for example, the first split is based on the component size n. Then, each subsequent split is based on the size of the component being split.

Thus, the sum S is the sum of products for each split, computed as s * (current_component_size - s), where s is the size of the subtree split by the edge.

The problem is to select edges in such a way that the sum of these products is maximized.

But how to compute this for a general tree.

Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. For each component, the maximum sum is the current split product plus the maximum sums of the two resulting components.

So the maximum sum S for a component of size m is the maximum possible (a*b) + S(a) + S(b), where a + b = m, and the split is chosen by selecting the best edge.

But how to compute this for a given component.

This approach is feasible for small n (up to 3000), but with n=3000, the recursion depth and the number of components would be too large.

But perhaps we can precompute for each edge the best way to split the component. However, this is not clear.

Another idea: Since the sum S is the sum of the products of the splits in the order of the splits, the maximum sum is achieved by choosing the splits in such a way that each split is as balanced as possible. So the optimal sum is the sum of products for the splits that are as balanced as possible for each component.

This is independent of the tree's structure, but only depends on the size of the components. For example, if a component of size m is split into a and b, where a and b are as balanced as possible, then the sum is a*b + sum for a + sum for b.

If this is the case, then the answer would be the same for any tree structure, and depends only on n. But this contradicts the sample input.

For example, in the first sample input, the answer is 3. For a chain of 3 nodes, the splits are 2*1 and 1*1. Sum 3. For a star-shaped tree of 3 nodes, the splits are 1*2 and 1*1. Sum 3. So the sum is the same regardless of the tree structure. Thus, perhaps the maximum sum S is indeed the same for all trees of size n.

But this can't be. Let's consider a tree with n=4. For a chain of 4 nodes, the splits would be:

Split into 2 and 2 (product 4). Then each 2 is split into 1 and 1 (product 1 each). Sum is 4+1+1=6.

For a star-shaped tree with center node connected to 4 leaves. The splits would be:

First split is any edge, product 1*3=3. Then, split another edge in the component of size 3: product 1*2=2. Then, split a third edge, product 1*1=1. Then, split the fourth edge, product 1*0=0 (no). Wait, no. For a star-shaped tree of 4 leaves and a center, the edges are all connected to the center. Removing an edge splits into 1 and 4-1=3. Product 3*1=3. Then, the component of size 3 (center and 3 leaves) can be split into another edge, product 1*2=2. Then, the component of size 2 (center and 2 leaves) can be split into 1*1=1. The fourth split would be 1*1=1. So sum is 3+2+1+1=7. Which is higher than the chain's sum of 6. So this suggests that the tree's structure does affect the maximum sum.

Thus, the earlier hypothesis that the sum depends only on n is incorrect. Therefore, the sum depends on the tree's structure and how the edges can be split to maximize the products.

This means that the problem requires us to find the best possible way to split the tree into edges, choosing the order of splits to maximize the sum of products, which depends on the tree's structure.

Now, the question is: how to compute this for a given tree.

The answer seems to be that each split must be the edge in the current component that, when removed, gives the maximum possible product. To find this edge, for each component, we need to find the edge that maximizes the product of the sizes of the two resulting parts.

This suggests that we can model the problem using a priority queue, where each entry represents a component and the best edge to split it. The priority is the product of the split. Each time, we select the component with the largest possible product, split it, and then add the two new components to the queue.

But how to track the components and their best edges.

Here's the plan:

1. Precompute for each edge in the original tree, the size of the subtree when that edge is removed. This is done via a post-order traversal. For each edge (u, v), the subtree size s is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at u when v is its parent.

2. For each edge, store the subtree size s. The initial product is s*(n - s).

3. Use a max-heap (priority queue) to track all possible splits. Each entry in the heap is a component (a subtree), represented by the edge that splits it into two parts. The priority is the product of the split.

But this approach doesn't account for the dynamic splitting of components. So, when a component is split into two parts, we need to recompute the best possible edges for those new parts.

This is challenging. For example, consider a component C that's split into C1 and C2. We need to find the best edge in C1 and the best edge in C2 to split them.

But how to track the edges in each component.

An alternative approach is to model the problem using a recursive function. For each component, find the edge that gives the maximum product, add that product to the sum, and recursively process the two resulting components.

But for a tree with up to 3000 nodes, this recursive approach may be feasible if implemented efficiently.

But how to implement it.

The key steps would be:

For a given component (a connected subtree):

- Iterate through all edges in the component.

- For each edge, compute the product of the sizes of the two parts when the edge is split.

- Select the edge with the maximum product.

- Add this product to the sum.

- Recursively process the two new components.

The problem is how to represent the components and efficiently compute the sizes of the splits.

But for each edge in the original tree, we have a precomputed s value (the size of the subtree when the edge is removed). However, when the component is split into smaller components, this s value may not reflect the current component's size.

Thus, this approach is only valid for the initial split. Subsequent splits require dynamic computation of the current component's size.

This suggests that the precomputed s values are not sufficient.

So, the crux of the problem is to dynamically compute the sizes of the splits for each edge in the current component.

To do this, for each component, we can perform a BFS or DFS to find the size of the two parts when an edge is removed.

But for a tree of size 3000, this could be computationally expensive if done for each split. But perhaps it's manageable.

Let's outline the steps for this approach:

1. Read the tree and build an adjacency list.

2. Preprocess the tree to find the parent-child relationships and subtree sizes for each edge. This can be done with a post-order traversal. For each node u, store its parent and the size of its subtree.

3. For each edge (u, v), store the subtree size s, which is the size of u's subtree if v is considered the parent. The product for this edge is s*(n - s).

4. Use a priority queue to keep track of all edges and their products. The priority queue is a max-heap based on the product.

5. Initialize the priority queue with all edges and their initial products.

6. Also, track which edges are available (not yet split).

7. While the priority queue is not empty:

   a. Extract the edge with the maximum product.

   b. If the edge is not available (already split), skip it.

   c. Add the product to the sum S.

   d. Split the component into two parts by removing this edge.

   e. For each of the two new components, compute the best possible edge to split (the one with maximum product) and add them to the priority queue.

But how to compute the best possible edge for each new component.

The problem is that for each new component, we need to find the edge within it that has the maximum product when split.

But how to compute the product for each edge in the new component.

This requires for each new component to perform a traversal to compute the subtree sizes and product for each edge in that component.

For example, after splitting a component into two parts, C1 and C2, we need to process C1 and C2:

For C1:

- Compute its size (size_c1 = s, where s is the original subtree size of the split edge).

- For each edge in C1, compute the product when split within C1. For example, for an edge e in C1, the product is s1 * (size_c1 - s1), where s1 is the size of the subtree in C1 when e is split.

But how to compute s1 for e in C1.

This suggests that for each split, we need to recompute the subtree sizes for the new component. This can be done by performing a post-order traversal within the new component.

But this is computationally intensive. For example, each split requires O(m) time for the new component, where m is the size of the component. For n=3000, the total time would be O(n^2), which is acceptable given the time limit of 3 seconds.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

For each split:

1. Select the edge with the maximum product.

2. Split the component into two parts.

3. For each part, compute the edges within it and their current product (based on the size of the part).

4. Add those edges to the priority queue.

But this requires, for each part, to find all edges within it and compute their products.

This can be done by performing a BFS or DFS on the component to find all edges.

For example, when splitting a component into C1 and C2:

- For C1: perform a BFS/DFS starting from one end of the split edge, and collect all nodes in C1. The size is the number of nodes.

- For each edge in C1 (edges connecting nodes in C1), compute the product as follows: during the traversal, for each node, determine its children and the subtree sizes.

But this is time-consuming for each split.

Alternatively, for each new component, we can perform a DFS to compute the subtree sizes for each edge within that component.

Here's a more detailed outline:

Function to compute edges and their products for a component:

def compute_edges_component(start_node, parent, component_size):

   stack = [(start_node, parent)]

   subtree_sizes = {}

   while stack:

       node, parent_node = stack.pop()

       subtree_size = 1

       for neighbor in adj[node]:

           if neighbor != parent_node and neighbor in component_nodes:

               stack.append( (neighbor, node) )

               subtree_size += subtree_sizes[neighbor]

       subtree_sizes[node] = subtree_size

       if parent_node is not None:

           edge = (min(node, parent_node), max(node, parent_node))

           s = subtree_sizes[node]

           product = s * (component_size - s)

           edges_with_products.append( ( -product, edge ) )

   return edges_with_products

But this is very time-consuming for each split.

Given the time constraints (n=3000), and each split potentially requiring O(m) time for a component of size m, the total time would be O(n^2), which for 3000 is 9 million operations. This is manageable.

Thus, the steps are:

- For each split edge, we split the component into two parts. For each part, collect all nodes in that part.

- For each part, perform a post-order traversal to compute the subtree sizes for each edge, then compute the product for each edge (s * (component_size - s)), and add those edges to the priority queue.

But how to collect the nodes in each part after splitting.

When an edge (u, v) is split, the two components are the subtree rooted at u (size s) and the rest (size n - s). But after splits, the components may have different sizes.

Thus, when splitting an edge (u, v) in a component of size m, the two parts have sizes s and m - s, where s is the size of the subtree of u in the current component.

But how to compute s for the current component.

This suggests that when we split a component, we need to perform a BFS/DFS to collect all nodes in one part (the subtree) and compute their size.

But this is manageable.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

1. Preprocess the original tree to compute the initial subtree sizes for each edge.

2. Initialize a priority queue with all edges, using their initial product (s * (n - s)).

3. Track which edges are active (not yet split).

4. The sum S starts at 0.

5. While the priority queue is not empty:

   a. Extract the edge (u, v) with the maximum product.

   b. If the edge is not active, skip.

   c. Add the product to S.

   d. Split the component into two parts. To do this, perform a BFS or DFS from u (excluding the edge (u, v)) to collect all nodes in one part (s is the size of this part).

   e. The other part's size is m - s, where m was the size of the original component.

   f. For each of the two new parts (s and m - s):

       i. If the part's size is 1, skip (no edges to split).

       ii. Collect all edges within this part.

       iii. For each edge in this part, compute its product (s_i * (part_size - s_i)), where s_i is the size of the subtree in this part when the edge is split.

       iv. Add these edges to the priority queue.

   g. Mark the edge (u, v) as inactive.

But how to collect the edges in each new part.

This seems computationally expensive, but manageable.

But how to track the edges and their activation status.

Perhaps, each edge can be represented as a tuple (u, v), and we can keep a set of active edges. When an edge is split, it's removed from the active set. The new edges in the new components are the active edges within those components.

But how to determine which edges are in a component.

This requires, when splitting a component, to collect all edges that are within the component.

For example, when splitting into part C1 and C2:

- C1's nodes are collected via BFS/DFS, and C1's edges are those edges that connect two nodes in C1.

- Similarly for C2.

But for a tree, each edge is either in C1 or C2, but not both. Because when you split on edge (u, v), all edges in the subtree of u (in the original split) are in C1, and the rest are in C2.

But after multiple splits, the components are smaller parts of the tree.

Thus, the steps would be:

After splitting an edge (u, v) in component C of size m:

1. The two new components are C1 (size s) and C2 (size m - s).

2. For C1:

   a. Collect all nodes in C1 via BFS/DFS starting from u, not crossing the split edge (u, v).

   b. For all edges in the original tree, check if both endpoints are in C1. Those edges form the edges of C1.

   c. For each such edge, compute their product within C1.

3. Add these edges to the priority queue.

But checking all edges for each split is O(n) time per split, which is not feasible for n=3000.

Thus, this approach is not efficient.

Alternative idea: For each component, maintain a list of edges that belong to it. But this requires dynamic management of edge lists for each component, which is complex.

Another idea: For each edge in the original tree, track which component it belongs to. When a component is split into C1 and C2, the edges in C1 are those that are part of the subtree C1, and similarly for C2. This can be determined by the initial split's subtree size.

But this is only possible for the initial split. Subsequent splits may require different tracking.

But perhaps, for each edge, the initial split's s value can be used to determine whether it is part of the current component.

But this seems unlikely, as subsequent splits can fragment the components in arbitrary ways.

Thus, this problem seems quite challenging.

Another approach is to realize that the sum S can be computed as the sum of the products of all edges, but ordered in such a way that each edge's product is multiplied by the number of times it is selected before any of its ancestors.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, considering that the sum S is the sum of the products of each edge when it is split, and the order in which edges are split is such that each edge is split only once, and each split is chosen to maximize the product.

But the key is that the product for each edge depends on the component size when it is split.

Thus, the maximum sum is achieved when each edge is split as early as possible in a large component.

But how to model this.

Perhaps, the optimal way is to split edges with the largest possible products first, regardless of their position in the tree.

But how to compute the product for each edge in the initial tree.

But this leads us back to the initial approach of summing all the initial products. However, this gives the wrong answer for the second sample input.

But the second sample input's correct answer is 10, which is 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10, while the sum of initial products is 6+4+4+4=18.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each edge's contribution to S is its product multiplied by the number of times it is counted in the sum. Which depends on the order in which edges are split.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps each edge's contribution is the product of its split, multiplied by the number of splits that include all edges along the path from the root to this edge.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of each edge as being part of a certain number of paths. The mex for a path is the smallest edge not present. To maximize S, we need to assign the smallest labels to edges that appear in the most paths. Because the mex of a path is determined by the smallest missing label. So, if a label is assigned to an edge that is in many paths, then the mex for those paths will be at least that label.

But how to assign labels to edges to maximize the sum.

This is a different perspective. The goal is to assign the smallest labels to edges that are part of the most paths, so that those edges contribute to the mex of more paths.

For example, edge 0 should be part of as many paths as possible. Edge 1 should be part of as many paths as possible that do not include edge 0. And so on.

Thus, the optimal assignment is to order the edges in decreasing order of the number of paths they are part of. Assign label 0 to the edge with the most paths, label 1 to the next, etc.

But how to compute the number of paths each edge is part of.

The number of paths that include an edge is equal to the product of the sizes of the two components when the edge is removed. For example, for an edge that, when removed, splits the tree into a and b, the number of paths that include it is a*b.

Thus, the edges with the largest a*b should be assigned the smallest labels.

Thus, the optimal labeling is to assign label 0 to the edge with the largest a*b, label 1 to the next largest, and so on.

Then, the sum S is the sum over all pairs of nodes (u, v) of the mex of their path.

This mex is the smallest label not present in the path.

Thus, the sum S can be computed as the sum over k of the number of pairs (u, v) whose path contains all edges labeled 0, 1, ..., k-1 but not k.

But this is equivalent to the sum over k of the number of pairs (u, v) whose path includes all edges labeled 0, 1, ..., k.

But how to compute this.

If the edges are labeled in order of decreasing a*b (the product of the split), then the sum S is the sum of the a*b values of the edges, multiplied by (k+1), where k is the label of the edge.

Wait, no. For example, an edge labeled k contributes a*b pairs that include all edges 0 to k. For example, if an edge is labeled 0, then all pairs that include this edge contribute 1 to S for k=0. If another edge is labeled 1, then the pairs that include this edge and the first edge contribute 1 for k=0 and 1 for k=1.

But this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, the sum S is the sum over all edges of (a*b) * (label of edge + 1).

Because, each edge labeled k contributes to the mex of all pairs that cross it, but do not cross any edge with a label less than k.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try the first sample:

Edges:

1-2: product 2 (s=1, n-s=2), labeled 0.

2-3: product 1 (s=1, n-s=1), labeled 1.

Sum S is 2*(0+1) + 1*(1+1) = 2*1 + 1*2 = 2 + 2 = 4. But the correct answer is 3.

So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the initial hypothesis is invalid.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for alternative approaches or insights.

Upon further research, this problem is similar to a problem where we assign edge weights to maximize the sum of mex values for all paths. The optimal strategy is to assign the labels in such a way that the edges form a linear chain, where each edge's removal splits the tree into two parts. The sum S is then the sum of the products of the sizes of these splits, ordered by the labels.

But how to model this.

Another insight: The maximum possible sum S is achieved by choosing the labels in the order of the edges in a Centroid Decomposition Tree (CDT). In CDT, each split is chosen to be the edge that splits the component into as balanced parts as possible.

This approach would recursively split the tree into parts, each time choosing the edge that splits the component into two parts as balanced as possible. The sum of the products of these splits is the answer.

Thus, the algorithm is to perform a centroid decomposition of the tree and sum the products of each split.

But how to compute this.

Centroid decomposition involves selecting a centroid node that splits the tree into components of size at most half of the original. But the problem requires edges to be split, not nodes.

Thus, perhaps the optimal solution is to select edges that split the current component into two parts as balanced as possible, and sum the products.

This is the same as the greedy approach of always selecting the edge with the maximum product for the current component.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For each component:

   Find the edge that when removed gives the maximum product (a*b).

   Add this product to the sum.

   Recurse on both components.

But the question is, how to implement this.

This requires for each component, find the edge with the maximum a*b product, which requires finding the edge that, when removed, splits the component into two parts with the largest possible product.

To compute this for a component, we can iterate over all edges in the component and compute the product for each.

But how to represent the components and their edges.

An alternative idea is to perform a post-order traversal for each component and compute the subtree sizes. For each edge in the component, the product is s * (m - s), where m is the size of the component.

Thus, for each component of size m:

   For each edge in the component:

      compute s = subtree size when the edge is removed.

      product = s * (m - s)

   Select the edge with the maximum product.

   Add the product to S.

   Recurse on the two new components.

But this requires, for each component, to compute the subtree sizes for all edges in it.

This can be done with a post-order traversal for each component.

For example:

def compute_max_product_component(component_nodes):

   # Build the sub-tree for the component.

   # Find the root (any node in the component).

   root = component_nodes[0]

   # Perform a post-order traversal to compute subtree sizes.

   subtree_sizes = {}

   visited = set()

   stack = [(root, None, False)]

   while stack:

       node, parent, processed = stack.pop()

       if processed:

           size = 1

           for child in adj[node]:

               if child != parent and child in component_nodes:

                   size += subtree_sizes[child]

           subtree_sizes[node] = size

       else:

           stack.append( (node, parent, True) )

           for child in adj[node]:

               if child != parent and child in component_nodes:

                   stack.append( (child, node, False) )

   # Compute products for all edges in the component.

   max_product = 0

   best_edge = None

   for node in component_nodes:

       for child in adj[node]:

           if child in component_nodes and subtree_sizes[child] < subtree_sizes[node]:

               s = subtree_sizes[child]

               product = s * (len(component_nodes) - s)

               if product > max_product:

                   max_product = product

                   best_edge = (node, child)

   return max_product, best_edge

This function takes a component (set of nodes) and returns the maximum product and the best edge to split.

Then, the algorithm proceeds as follows:

def calculate_S(component):

   if len(component) <= 1:

       return 0

   m = len(component)

   max_p, best_edge = compute_max_product_component(component)

   if best_edge is None:

       return 0

   # Split the component into two parts.

   u, v = best_edge

   # Compute the nodes in each part.

   part1 = set()

   stack = [v]

   visited = set([u])

   while stack:

       node = stack.pop()

       part1.add(node)

       for neighbor in adj[node]:

           if neighbor not in visited and neighbor in component and neighbor != u:

               visited.add(neighbor)

               stack.append(neighbor)

   part2 = component - part1

   return max_p + calculate_S(part1) + calculate_S(part2)

But for large n=3000, this recursive approach may be feasible if the splits are balanced. But in the worst case, it could be O(n^2) time.

But given that Python's recursion depth is limited, this approach may need to be implemented iteratively.

Alternatively, using memoization and iterative approach.

But how to represent the components.

Each component is a set of nodes, which for large n is not feasible. Instead, perhaps we can track components using bitmask or other representations, but for n=3000, this is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is impractical.

Another idea: For each edge, the maximum product is determined by the initial split. If we process edges in order of their initial product (s*(n-s)), and sum these products, this may give the maximum possible sum.

But this is the approach that failed the second sample input. However, in the second sample input, the sum of initial products is 4+6+4+4=18, but the correct answer is 10. So this approach is incorrect.

But why?

Because the initial product assumes that the entire tree is split into two parts. But when you split into multiple parts, the products for subsequent splits are based on smaller components.

Thus, the correct sum is achieved by selecting the edge with the largest product in the current component, not the initial component.

Thus, the initial product is not sufficient, and the order of splitting must account for the current component's size.

Thus, the only way to compute the correct sum is to dynamically compute the products for each component as it is split.

But how to implement this efficiently.

Perhaps using a priority queue where each entry represents a component and the best possible edge to split it, along with the component's size.

But how to dynamically compute the best edge for each component.

Here's the plan:

1. Initially, the entire tree is one component of size n.

2. For each component, we need to find the edge that splits it into two parts with the maximum product. The product is computed as s*(m - s), where m is the component's size and s is the size of one part.

3. Use a priority queue to keep track of components, ordered by their maximum possible product.

4. Each entry in the queue contains the component's current maximum product and the edge that achieves it.

5. Extract the component with the largest product, add the product to the sum, then split the component into two new components.

6. For each new component, compute its maximum product and add it to the priority queue.

7. Repeat until all components are split into single nodes.

The problem is how to represent the components and compute their maximum product.

But how to compute the maximum product for a component.

For each component, the maximum product is achieved by the edge that splits it into two parts with the largest possible product.

But to find this edge, we need to perform a traversal of the component to compute the sizes of the possible splits.

Thus, for each component, we need to perform a post-order traversal to compute the subtree sizes for all edges in it.

But this is time-consuming.

An alternative approach is to precompute for each edge the initial product and use the priority queue to process edges in order of their initial product. However, this doesn't account for the dynamic component sizes and thus is incorrect.

But in practice, the sum of the initial products is not the correct answer. For the second sample input, this sum is 18, but the correct answer is 10. So this approach is not valid.

Thus, the correct approach is to dynamically compute the best split for each component as it is processed.

But for large n, this may not be feasible.

However, given the problem's time constraints, perhaps a BFS-based approach to compute the subtree sizes for each component is manageable.

Here's the implementation plan:

- Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

- Use a queue to process components.

- For each component, compute the best edge to split and its product.

- Split the component and add the new components to the queue.

- Keep track of the sum.

Steps:

1. Read the input and build the tree.

2. Initialize the queue with the entire tree (all nodes).

3. While the queue is not empty:

   a. Dequeue a component.

   b. If the component size is 1, skip.

   c. Compute the best edge to split the component and its product.

   d. Add the product to the sum.

   e. Split the component into two parts.

   f. Enqueue the two parts.

4. Output the sum.

The key part is step 3c, which requires computing the best edge for the component.

To compute this, for each component:

- Perform a BFS/DFS to find the sizes of the subtrees for each possible edge.

For example:

def compute_best_edge(component_nodes):

   # Build adjacency list for the component.

   component_adj = defaultdict(list)

   for node in component_nodes:

       for neighbor in adj[node]:

           if neighbor in component_nodes:

               component_adj[node].append(neighbor)

   # Choose a root node.

   root = next(iter(component_nodes))

   # Perform post-order traversal to compute subtree sizes.

   subtree_sizes = {}

   visited = set()

   stack = [(root, None, False)]

   while stack:

       node, parent, processed = stack.pop()

       if processed:

           size = 1

           for child in component_adj[node]:

               if child != parent and child in component_nodes:

                   size += subtree_sizes[child]

           subtree_sizes[node] = size

       else:

           stack.append( (node, parent, True) )

           for child in component_adj[node]:

               if child != parent and child in component_nodes:

                   stack.append( (child, node, False) )

   # Find the edge with maximum product.

   max_product = 0

   best_edge = None

   component_size = len(component_nodes)

   for node in component_nodes:

       for child in component_adj[node]:

           if child in component_nodes and subtree_sizes.get(child, 0) < subtree_sizes.get(node, 0):

               s = subtree_sizes[child]

               product = s * (component_size - s)

               if product > max_product:

                   max_product = product

                   best_edge = (node, child)

   return max_product, best_edge

This function computes the best edge for a component.

Once the best edge is found, the component is split into two parts. This is done by performing a BFS from one end of the edge to collect all nodes in one part.

def split_component(component_nodes, best_edge):

   u, v = best_edge

   part1 = set()

   stack = [v]

   visited = set([u])

   part1.add(v)

   while stack:

       node = stack.pop()

       for neighbor in adj[node]:

           if neighbor not in visited and neighbor in component_nodes and neighbor != u:

               visited.add(neighbor)

               part1.add(neighbor)

               stack.append(neighbor)

   part2 = component_nodes - part1

   return part1, part2

This function splits the component into two parts.

The main loop then enqueues the new components if their size is >=2.

But for large n, this approach is O(n^2) time, which may be feasible for n=3000.

Testing this approach on the sample inputs:

First sample:

component_nodes = {1,2,3}

compute_best_edge returns product 2 (split into 1 and 2 nodes), sum += 2.

Split into {2,3} and {1}.

Process {2,3}:

compute_best_edge returns product 1 (split into 1 and 1), sum += 1. Total 3.

Second sample:

Initial component {1,2,3,4,5}.

Best edge is 1-3, product 3*2=6. sum=6.

Split into {1,2,4} and {3,5}.

Process {3,5}:

compute best edge 3-5, product 1*1=1. sum +=1. Split into {3}, {5}.

Process {1,2,4}:

compute best edge 1-2 or 1-4. Both have product 1*2=2. sum +=2. Split into {2} and {1,4}.

Process {1,4}:

best edge is 1-4, product 1*1=1. sum +=1. Total sum 6+1+2+1=10.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach is correct.

Thus, the Python code should implement this algorithm.

But how to represent the component nodes efficiently.

For each component, we can represent it as a set of nodes.

But for large n, creating sets and performing operations on them can be time-consuming.

An alternative is to represent components using a visited array or a bitmask. But for n=3000, a bitmask is not feasible. Instead, we can use a list of nodes.

Thus, the code outline is:

import sys

from collections import defaultdict

def main():

    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())

    adj = defaultdict(list)

    edges = []

    for _ in range(n-1):

        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

        adj[u].append(v)

        adj[v].append(u)

    total = 0

    from queue import Queue

    q = Queue()

    initial_component = set(range(1, n+1))  # all nodes

    q.put(initial_component)

    while not q.empty():

        component = q.get()

        m = len(component)

        if m == 1:

            continue

        # Compute best edge and max_product

        # Build adjacency list for the component

        component_adj = defaultdict(list)

        for node in component:

            for neighbor in adj[node]:

                if neighbor in component:

                    component_adj[node].append(neighbor)

        # Post-order traversal to compute subtree sizes

        root = next(iter(component))

        subtree_sizes = {}

        stack = [(root, None, False)]

        while stack:

            node, parent, processed = stack.pop()

            if processed:

                size = 1

                for child in component_adj[node]:

                    if child != parent:

                        size += subtree_sizes[child]

                subtree_sizes[node] = size

            else:

                stack.append( (node, parent, True) )

                for child in reversed(component_adj[node]):

                    if child != parent:

                        stack.append( (child, node, False) )

        # Find the best edge

        max_product = 0

        best_edge = None

        component_size = m

        for node in component:

            for child in component_adj[node]:

                if subtree_sizes[child] < subtree_sizes[node]:

                    s = subtree_sizes[child]

                    product = s * (component_size - s)

                    if product > max_product:

                        max_product = product

                        best_edge = (node, child)

        if best_edge is None:

            continue

        total += max_product

        # Split the component

        u, v = best_edge

        part1 = set()

        visited = {u}

        stack = [v]

        part1.add(v)

        while stack:

            node = stack.pop()

            for neighbor in adj[node]:

                if neighbor not in visited and neighbor in component and neighbor != u:

                    visited.add(neighbor)

                    part1.add(neighbor)

                    stack.append(neighbor)

        part2 = component - part1

        if len(part1) >= 2:

            q.put(part1)

        if len(part2) >= 2:

            q.put(part2)

    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

But this code may have performance issues for n=3000 due to the multiple BFS/DFS traversals and the use of sets for components. For example, the split_component function uses a set for part1 and part2. For large components, this can be slow.

To optimize, we can represent components using a list and a visited array. Alternatively, during the split, we can mark nodes in part1 using a boolean array.

But for the sake of time, the above code may pass for n=3000, but in practice, it may be too slow. To optimize, we can use bitmask or other representations, but in Python, this is challenging.

Alternative approach: Represent each component as a list of nodes, and during the split, perform a BFS to find the part1 nodes.

But even this may be slow for Python.

Another optimization is to precompute the adjacency list and avoid rebuilding it for each component.

But in the code above, the component_adj is built each time by iterating over the component's nodes and their neighbors. This is O(m) for each component, which is acceptable.

Another optimization is to use a visited array for the BFS during the split.

Thus, the code can be modified as follows:

During the split:

def split_component(component, best_edge, component_nodes_set):

    u, v = best_edge

    part1 = []

    visited = set()

    visited.add(u)

    stack = [v]

    part1.append(v)

    visited.add(v)

    while stack:

        node = stack.pop()

        for neighbor in adj[node]:

            if neighbor not in visited and neighbor in component_nodes_set and neighbor != u:

                visited.add(neighbor)

                part1.append(neighbor)

                stack.append(neighbor)

    part1_set = set(part1)

    part2 = [node for node in component if node not in part1_set]

    return part1, part2

But this requires component to be a list for efficient iteration.

But since the component is represented as a set, converting it to a list each time may be time-consuming.

Thus, in the code, the component is stored as a set. But iterating over a set is manageable.

But for large components, the list comprehensions can be slow.

Thus, the code may need further optimization.

However, given the time constraints, the code may be accepted for n=3000.

Let's test the code with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

3

1 2

2 3

The code should compute:

Initial component {1,2,3}.

Best edge is 1-2 or 2-3. Let's see:

For root=1:

post-order traversal.

subtree_sizes[1] = 1 (assuming it's the root).

But for node 2, children are 1 and 3. So during traversal:

root=2.

But the code selects the root as the first node in the component, which may vary.

But assuming the best edge is the one with product 2*1=2.

Sum +=2.

Split into {2,3} and {1}.

Process {2,3}:

Best edge is 2-3, product 1*1=1. Sum +=1. Total 3.

Sample Output: 3.

Sample Input 2:

5

1 2

1 3

1 4

3 5

Initial component {1,2,3,4,5} (size 5).

Best edge is 1-3, product 2*3=6. Sum 6.

Split into {3,5} and {1,2,4}.

Process {3,5} (size 2):

Best edge is 3-5, product 1*1=1. Sum +=1. Total 7.

Process {1,2,4} (size 3):

Best edge is 1-2, product 1*2=2. Sum +=2. Total 9.

Split into {2} and {1,4}.

Process {1,4} (size 2):

Best edge is 1-4, product 1*1=1. Sum +=1. Total 10.

Process {2}, {5}, {3}, etc. (size 1, no splits).

Final sum is 10.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

But for larger n, the code may be too slow. To optimize, we can use iterative BFS/DFS and avoid using sets for components.

But given the problem's constraints and time limits, this code may be sufficient.
