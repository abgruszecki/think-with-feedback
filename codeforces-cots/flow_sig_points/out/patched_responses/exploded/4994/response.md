Okay, I need to solve this problem where Calvin the robot moves on a grid and we have to count the number of non-empty contiguous substrings that bring him back to the starting position. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the key observation here is that for a substring to result in Calvin returning to the start, the net displacement in both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions must be zero. So each command contributes a certain delta to x and y. For example, 'U' is y+1, 'D' is y-1, 'R' is x+1, 'L' is x-1. Wait, actually, maybe I should model the directions properly. Let's see:

Wait, for movement: Let's define the directions such that 'U' increases y by 1, 'D' decreases y by 1, 'R' increases x by 1, and 'L' decreases x by 1. So for each command, we can track the cumulative x and y.

So, for a substring from index i to j (inclusive, 0-based), the sum of the deltas for x and y from i to j must be zero. Because that means the total movement cancels out, bringing Calvin back to the start.

The problem is to find all such substrings. Now, the challenge is how to compute this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 200, which allows O(n²) solutions since 200^2 is 40,000, which is manageable. But let's check.

The straightforward approach would be to precompute the cumulative x and y for each position, then iterate over all possible substrings and check if the delta x and delta y between the start and end of the substring are both zero. But for n=200, the number of possible substrings is n*(n+1)/2, which is 200*201/2 = 20100, which is very manageable. So even a O(n²) approach would work here.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think. For each possible start and end, compute the sum of x and y movements in that interval. If both are zero, count it.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute the prefix sums for x and y. Let's say we have two arrays, prefix_x and prefix_y, where prefix_x[i] is the sum of x deltas from command 0 to i-1 (since prefix sums are typically 0-based for the start). For example, for commands in order, prefix_x[0] is 0, prefix_x[1] is the delta after first command, etc.

Wait, for prefix sums, perhaps we can model it as:

prefix_x[0] = 0

prefix_x[i] = prefix_x[i-1] + dx of the (i-1)th command.

Similarly for prefix_y.

Then, for a substring starting at index a (original string's a-th position) and ending at index b (original string's b-th position, inclusive?), the delta_x would be prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a], and delta_y similarly. If both are zero, then it's a valid substring.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (a, b) where 0 <= a <= b < n (since the substring is from a to b inclusive, which is length (b - a + 1)) such that prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] = 0 and prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a] = 0.

So for each possible a and b (with a <= b), we need to check if the difference in x and y is zero.

This is O(n²) time. Since n is up to 200, 200*200 = 40,000 operations, which is acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Precompute prefix_x and prefix_y.

- For each a in 0 to n-1:

   - For each b in a to n-1:

      - Check if (prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] == 0) and (prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a] == 0). If yes, increment the count.

So this straightforward approach should work. Let's test the examples.

First example:

Input: 6 URLLDR

Let's compute the commands:

U, R, L, L, D, R.

Each command's dx and dy:

U: dy +1, dx 0.

R: dx +1, dy 0.

L: dx -1.

L: dx -1.

D: dy -1.

R: dx +1.

Now, the prefix_x and prefix_y arrays:

prefix_x[0] = 0

prefix_x[1] = 0 (since first command is U, which doesn't affect x)

prefix_x[2] = 0 + 1 (R) = 1

prefix_x[3] = 1 -1 (L) = 0

prefix_x[4] = 0 -1 (L) = -1

prefix_x[5] = -1 (D doesn't affect x) → wait no, D is dy -1. So D's dx is 0. So prefix_x[5] remains -1.

prefix_x[6] = -1 +1 (R) = 0.

prefix_y[0] =0.

prefix_y[1] =1 (U)

prefix_y[2] =1 (R doesn't affect y)

prefix_y[3] =1 (L doesn't affect y)

prefix_y[4] =1 (L doesn't affect y)

prefix_y[5] =1 -1 (D) → 0.

prefix_y[6] =0 (R doesn't affect y).

So for all possible (a, b) pairs:

Looking for when prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] ==0 and prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a] ==0.

In the first example, the entire substring (a=0, b=5) gives:

b+1 =6. prefix_x[6] - prefix_x[0] =0-0=0.

prefix_y[6] - prefix_y[0] =0-0=0. So valid. That's the entire string.

Another substring is a=1, b=2 (commands R and L). Let's see:

b+1 =3. prefix_x[3] - prefix_x[1] =0 -0=0.

prefix_y[3] - prefix_y[1] =1 -1=0. So yes. So that's the substring of length 2. So total 2 in the first example, which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Another example: the third sample input is 7 RLRLRLR. The output is 12.

So each pair of R and L (or L and R) would contribute, perhaps. Let's see: R is +1, L is -1. So each RL would cancel. But in a string like RLRLRLR, which is R L R L R L R. The possible substrings of even length might have sum zero.

But according to the sample, the output is 12. So the approach of checking all possible substrings would work.

So the code needs to compute the prefix sums, then iterate all possible a and b, and count when the deltas are zero.

Now, the code steps:

Read n, then the string s.

Compute the prefix_x and prefix_y arrays.

Then loop a from 0 to n-1:

   loop b from a to n-1:

       compute dx = prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a]

       compute dy = prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a]

       if dx ==0 and dy ==0: count +=1

Return count.

That's straightforward.

Now, let's code this in Python.

First, let's handle the prefix sums:

Initialize prefix_x as [0], prefix_y as [0].

For each character in s:

   current dx and dy.

   for example, for 'U': dx=0, dy=1.

   then append prefix_x[-1] + dx to prefix_x, same for dy.

So:

dx_dict = {'U':0, 'D':0, 'R':1, 'L':-1}

dy_dict = {'U':1, 'D':-1, 'R':0, 'L':0}

Then:

prefix_x = [0]

prefix_y = [0]

for c in s:

   dx = dx_dict[c]

   dy = dy_dict[c]

   prefix_x.append( prefix_x[-1] + dx )

   prefix_y.append( prefix_y[-1] + dy )

Then, for a in 0 to n-1:

   for b in a to n-1:

       check if prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] ==0 and prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a] ==0.

So that's O(n²) time.

But since n is 200, 200^2 is 40,000 operations. Which is way under the time constraints. Even for Python, 40,000 iterations are manageable.

So the code is straightforward.

Let's test the sample input:

Third example:

Input 7 RLRLRLR

Let's compute the prefix_x and prefix_y:

Each R is dx=1, dy=0.

Each L is dx=-1, dy=0.

The string is R L R L R L R.

So the commands are R, L, R, L, R, L, R.

So:

prefix_x starts at 0.

After first R (command 0): prefix_x becomes [0, 1]

After L (command1): prefix_x becomes 1-1=0. So prefix_x is [0,1,0]

Then R again: 0+1=1. [0,1,0,1]

Then L: 1-1=0. [0,1,0,1,0]

Then R: 0+1=1. [0,1,0,1,0,1]

Then L: 1-1=0. [0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

Then R: 0+1=1. So prefix_x is [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]

prefix_y is all zeros since all commands are R and L.

So for any substring, the delta y is zero. So we need delta x to be zero.

So the problem reduces to counting all substrings where the sum of x changes is zero.

But since all the commands are R and L (dx +/-1), the prefix_x for this case will alternate between 1 and 0.

Looking for (a, b) where prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] ==0.

So in this case, the possible (a, b) pairs where the delta x is zero.

For example, a=0, b=1: prefix_x[2] - prefix_x[0] =0-0=0. So that's R L: sum is 1-1=0.

So this is counted.

Similarly, a=0, b=3: prefix_x[4] - prefix_x[0] =0-0=0. So R L R L: sum is 0.

Similarly, a=0, b=5: sum is 0.

a=0, b=6: sum is 1 (since prefix_x[7] is 1). So no.

Then for a=1, b=1: prefix_x[2]-prefix_x[1] =0-1= -1. No.

But a=1, b=2: prefix_x[3]-prefix_x[1] =1-1=0. So the substring is L R: dx is 0.

Yes. So each pair of RL or LR would contribute.

Wait, perhaps the total number of such substrings is equal to the number of intervals [a,b] where the sum of dx is zero, and dy is zero. But in this case, dy is always zero. So the problem is to count the number of intervals where the dx sum is zero.

So in this case, the number of such intervals is 12. How?

For example, in the string R L R L R L R:

The prefix_x array is [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1].

So, for each a and b, we need prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a] = 0.

Which implies prefix_x[b+1] = prefix_x[a].

So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (a, b) where a <= b and prefix_x[a] == prefix_x[b+1].

So for the third example, the prefix_x is 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1.

So the indices in prefix_x are 0 to 7.

Looking for pairs (a, b) where prefix_x[a] == prefix_x[b+1].

So for a in 0 to 7-1 (since b+1 can be up to 7).

Wait, in the code, a ranges from 0 to n-1 (since a is the start index in the original string, which has 7 elements). So a can be 0 to 6. For each a, b can be from a to 6. Then b+1 ranges from a+1 to 7.

So the prefix_x array has length 8.

Looking for a and b where prefix_x[a] == prefix_x[b+1].

In the third example, the prefix_x array is [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1].

So for a=0, we need to find all b where prefix_x[b+1] is 0. Let's see:

Looking for b+1 where prefix_x[b+1] is 0. The indices where prefix_x is 0 are 0, 2,4,6.

So b+1 can be 0: then b would be -1, which is invalid.

So for a=0:

b can be such that b+1 is 0 (invalid), 2 (b=1), 4 (b=3),6 (b=5).

So for a=0, possible b are 1,3,5.

Wait, but for a=0, b can range from 0 to 6.

So b+1 ranges from 1 to 7.

Looking in the prefix_x array for indices 1 to 7, which are 1,0,1,0,1,0,1.

So for a=0, prefix_x[a] is 0. So we need to find b+1 indices where prefix_x is 0. In the prefix_x array from index 1 to 7, the 0s are at indices 2,4,6.

So b+1 can be 2,4,6. Which means b=1,3,5.

So for a=0, the possible b are 1,3,5. Each of those gives a substring of length 2, 4,6. Each of these substrings sum to zero.

So that's 3 substrings.

Then a=1: prefix_x[a] is 1 (prefix_x[1] is 1). We need to find b+1 where prefix_x is 1. These are indices 1,3,5,7.

So for a=1:

b can be 0 (b+1=1: but a=1, b can't be 0), so possible b+1 are 3,5,7. So b is 2,4,6.

Each of these gives a substring starting at a=1, ending at b=2 (commands L and R), sum is 0.

So for a=1, there are 3 substrings.

Similarly, a=2: prefix_x[a] is 0. So same as a=0. The possible b+1 indices where prefix_x is 0. So in the range 3 to 7, the 0s are at 4,6. Wait, b starts at a=2. So b can be 2 to 6. So b+1 ranges from 3 to 7.

In the prefix_x array, the values at indices 3 to7 are 1,0,1,0,1.

Looking for 0s: at indices4 and 6. So b+1=4 → b=3; b+1=6 →b=5. So for a=2, there are two substrings.

Similarly, a=3: prefix_x[a] is1. So looking for b+1 where prefix_x is 1. These are 3,5,7. But since a=3, b can be 3 to6. So b+1 is 4 (prefix_x is0?), wait no. Wait, let's recheck:

Wait a=3, prefix_x[a] is 1 (prefix_x[3] is1). Looking for b+1 where prefix_x[b+1] is1. In the prefix_x array, indices after a (since b >=a=3) are:

b+1 can be 4 (prefix_x[4] =0), 5 (prefix_x[5]=1), 6 (prefix_x[6] =0),7 (prefix_x[7]=1).

So the values are 0,1,0,1. So in b+1 indices 5 and7. So b can be4 and6.

So two substrings.

Similarly, a=4: prefix_x[a] is0. Looking for b+1 indices where prefix_x is0. In the range of a=4 (b starts at4), b+1 ranges from5 to7.

prefix_x[5] is1, 6 is0,7 is1. So only index6 (b=5) is valid. So one substring.

a=5: prefix_x[a] is1. Looking for b+1 where prefix_x is1. For a=5, b can be5 or6. So b+1 is6 or7. prefix_x[6] is0,7 is1. So only7. So b=6. One substring.

a=6: prefix_x[a] is0. Looking for b+1=7. prefix_x[7] is1. So no.

Adding these up:

a=0:3

a=1:3

a=2:2

a=3:2

a=4:1

a=5:1

a=6:0

Total is 3+3+2+2+1+1=12. Which matches the sample output.

So the code works.

So the code is correct.

Now, implement it.

So code steps:

Read n, read s.

Compute prefix_x and prefix_y.

Initialize count to 0.

Loop a from 0 to n-1:

   for b in a to n-1:

       dx = prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a]

       dy = prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a]

       if dx ==0 and dy ==0:

           count +=1

Return count.

So code:

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    dx_dict = {'U':0, 'D':0, 'R':1, 'L':-1}
    dy_dict = {'U':1, 'D':-1, 'R':0, 'L':0}

    prefix_x = [0]
    prefix_y = [0]

    for c in s:
        dx = dx_dict[c]
        dy = dy_dict[c]
        prefix_x.append( prefix_x[-1] + dx )
        prefix_y.append( prefix_y[-1] + dy )

    count =0

    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a, n):
            dx = prefix_x[b+1] - prefix_x[a]
            dy = prefix_y[b+1] - prefix_y[a]
            if dx ==0 and dy ==0:
                count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
7
RLRLRLR
""",
            "output": \
"""\
12
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Thus, the code works for all the sample cases.

Now, the code is O(n²) time and O(n) space. Which is optimal for n up to 200. There's no way to do better than O(n²) in the worst case, because the answer itself can be O(n²), like in the third example where each pair of R and L contributes. So no way to optimize further.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

dx_map = {'U': 0, 'D': 0, 'R': 1, 'L': -1}
dy_map = {'U': 1, 'D': -1, 'R': 0, 'L': 0}

prefix_x = [0]
prefix_y = [0]

for c in s:
    prefix_x.append(prefix_x[-1] + dx_map[c])
    prefix_y.append(prefix_y[-1] + dy_map[c])

count = 0
for a in range(n):
    for b in range(a, n):
        if prefix_x[b+1] == prefix_x[a] and prefix_y[b+1] == prefix_y[a]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```
