Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the task is to find all possible k values (the lengths of the original array x) that could generate the given array a. The constraints say that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and we need to output all possible k's in increasing order.

First, let's understand how the array a is built. The formula given is a_i = x_{(i-1) mod k} + a_{i-1}, starting with a_0=0. So for each i from 1 to n, a_i is a cumulative sum where each step adds an element from the x array in a cyclic manner (since (i-1) mod k cycles through 0 to k-1).

Our goal is to determine for each possible k (from 1 to n) whether there exists an x array of length k that would generate the given a array. 

So how do we check for a particular k whether it's valid? Let's think step by step.

For a given k, the x array is determined by the differences between consecutive a elements, but in a cyclic way. For example, the first element of x is x_0 = a_1 - a_0 = a_1 (since a_0 is 0). Then x_1 = a_2 - a_1, x_2 = a_3 - a_2, and so on. But when we reach the k-th element, the next step would cycle back to x_0. 

Wait, no. Wait, the indices in x are (i-1) mod k. So for each position j in x (from 0 to k-1), all the terms x_j would be added at positions i where (i-1) mod k = j. So for example, if k is 3, then for i=1, (i-1)=0 mod 3 → x_0; i=2 → 1 mod 3 → x_1; i=3 → 2 mod3 → x_2; i=4 → 3 mod3=0 → x_0 again, and so on.

Thus, for each k, the x array must be such that, for every position m in 0 to k-1, all the a_i - a_{i-1} where (i-1) mod k = m are equal to x_m. So, the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) must be consistent for each position in the x array's cycle.

So, for a given k, the steps are:

1. Check all the positions in the a array. For each i (from 1 to n), compute the difference d_i = a_i - a_{i-1}.

2. For each j from 0 to k-1, collect all the differences d_i where (i-1) mod k == j. All these differences must be equal. Otherwise, this k is invalid.

3. If for all j in 0..k-1, all d's in the group j are the same, then k is a valid candidate.

So the plan is: iterate k from 1 to n. For each k, check for each group j (0 to k-1) that all d_i in group j are the same. If all groups are consistent, then k is valid.

But how to efficiently check this?

First, compute all the differences d_1 to d_n (since i ranges from 1 to n, there are n differences). d_i = a_i - a_{i-1}.

Then, for a candidate k, for each i (from 1 to n), the position in the x array is (i-1) mod k. So for each group j in 0..k-1, collect all d_i where (i-1) mod k == j. Then check that all elements in each group are equal.

But checking this for each k could be time-consuming if done naively. For n up to 1000, and k up to 1000, the total number of operations would be O(n^2), which is acceptable because 1000^2 is 1e6 operations, which is manageable within the time constraints.

So the steps are:

1. Read n and the array a. Compute a_0 as 0, a_1 to a_n as given.

2. Compute the differences d_1 to d_n, where d_i = a[i] - a[i-1]. Note that a is 1-based here. So for example, a_1 in the input is a[1], a_0 is 0. So d_1 is a[1] - a[0] = a_1 - 0 = a_1. Then d_2 = a[2] - a[1], etc.

Wait, the input is the second line as a_1 to a_n. Let's see: the input is given as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. So in code, when we read the list, we can store it as a list of length n, with a[0] being a_1, a[1] being a_2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the input is given as the second line with a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. So if the input is 5 elements, then the array a is of length 6 (including a_0=0). So the input is given as a_1 to a_n. So in code, we can create a list where a[0] = 0, and a[1] to a[n] are the input numbers. Then, the differences d_i = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

Once we have all the d_i, for each possible k (from 1 to n), we need to check if grouping the d_i into groups based on (i-1) mod k, each group has the same value.

So for each k:

- For each position j in 0 to k-1:
   - Check all d_i where (i-1) mod k == j. All must be equal.
- If all groups are consistent, then k is valid.

So for each k, we can loop through each i (from 1 to n), compute (i-1) mod k, which gives j. For each j, we track the first value in that group and check all subsequent values in the group against the first. If any differ, then the k is invalid.

But how to implement this efficiently?

An approach is to precompute the differences, then for each k, iterate through each i (from 1 to n), compute j = (i-1) mod k. For each j, we need to check that all d_i in this group j are the same.

So for each k:

- Initialize a dictionary or list to track the expected value for each j. For j in 0..k-1, if the group j has at least one element, then all elements must equal the first element in the group. So for each group j, the first element is the expected value, and all others must match.

So the steps for checking k:

valid = True
Create a list values of size k, initialized to None.
for i in 1 to n:
    j = (i-1) % k
    current_d = d[i-1] (since d is 0-based in the list)
    if values[j] is None:
        values[j] = current_d
    else:
        if current_d != values[j]:
            valid = False
            break
if valid:
    add k to the result list.

This is O(n) per k. Since n is up to 1000, and k up to 1000, this is O(1e6) operations, which is acceptable.

So the code steps would be:

- Read n and the a array.

- Precompute the list of differences d.

- For each k from 1 to n:

   - Initialize a list 'expected' of size k, all None.

   - For each i in 1..n (so index in the d list is i-1):

      - j = (i-1) mod k

      - if expected[j] is None, set it to d[i-1]

      - else, check if d[i-1] equals expected[j]. If not, mark k as invalid and break.

   - If all checks passed, add k to the possible list.

- Finally, collect all valid k's, sort them, and output.

This approach should work, but let's test against the examples.

First example:

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

The a array is [0,1,2,3,4,5]

d is [1-0=1, 2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1,5-4=1]. So all d's are 1.

For any k, all groups would have the same value. Because all d's are 1. So for any k, each group j will have all elements 1. Hence all k's are valid.

Second example:

Input:
5
1 3 5 6 8

a is [0,1,3,5,6,8]

d is [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]

So the d array is [1,2,2,1,2]

Possible k=3:

Check for each group j (0,1,2):

For k=3, group j is (i-1) mod 3.

i runs from 1 to 5 (since n=5):

i=1: (i-1) =0 mod3 → j=0. d=1. expected[0] =1.

i=2: (1) mod3=1. d=2. expected[1] =2.

i=3: (2) mod3=2. d=2. expected[2] =2.

i=4: (3) mod3=0. d=1. expected[0] is already 1. So check 1 ==1: ok.

i=5: (4) mod3=1. d=2. expected[1] is 2: ok.

All groups are consistent. So k=3 is valid.

Another possible k=5. Let's see:

For k=5, each group j is 0,1,2,3,4.

Each j is (i-1) mod5.

i ranges from 1 to5:

i=1 → 0 mod5 →0: d=1.

i=2 →1 mod5 →1: d=2.

i=3 →2 mod5 →2: d=2.

i=4 →3 mod5 →3: d=1.

i=5 →4 mod5 →4: d=2.

Each group has only one element (since k=5 and n=5). So all groups are valid. So k=5 is allowed.

Third example:

Input:
3
1 5 3

a array is [0,1,5,3]

d's are [1,4,-2].

Check for k=3:

Each group j is (i-1) mod3.

i=1 →0 mod3 →0: d=1.

i=2 →1 mod3 →1: d=4.

i=3 →2 mod3 →2: d=-2.

Each group has one element. So valid. So k=3 is allowed.

Other k's?

For k=1:

All i-1 mod1 =0. So all d's must be same. Here d's are 1,4,-2. Not same. So invalid.

k=2:

Groups j=0 and 1.

i runs from 1 to3:

i=1 →0 mod2 →0: d=1.

i=2 →1 mod2 →1: d=4.

i=3 →2 mod2 →0. d=-2. Check group 0: first is 1, then -2. So invalid.

So only k=3 is valid.

So the code should handle these cases correctly.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, read input:

n = int(input())

a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))  # a_1 to a_n.

Then, compute a_0 =0, a_1, a_2...a_n. So the a array is [0] + a_list.

But wait, the a array is of length n+1 (since n is the length of a_1 to a_n). So for i from 0 to n, a[0] is 0, a[1] is the first input element, etc.

Then, the differences d_i = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

So in code:

a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

d = []
for i in range(1, n+1):
    d.append(a[i] - a[i-1])

Then, for each k from 1 to n:

valid = True

expected = [None]*k

for idx in range(n):  # because d has length n, indices 0 to n-1 correspond to i=1 to n.

    # i is 1-based. So for idx in 0..n-1, i-1 is idx.

    j = (idx) % k  # because (i-1) = idx → (i-1) mod k → j = idx mod k.

    current_d = d[idx]

    if expected[j] is None:
        expected[j] = current_d
    else:
        if current_d != expected[j]:
            valid = False
            break

if valid:

    add k to the result.

So code for that part would be:

valid_ks = []

for k in range(1, n+1):

    expected = [None] * k

    valid = True

    for idx in range(n):

        j = idx % k  # because (i-1) is idx.

        current_d = d[idx]

        if expected[j] is None:
            expected[j] = current_d
        else:
            if expected[j] != current_d:
                valid = False
                break

    if valid:
        valid_ks.append(k)

Then, sort valid_ks and print the count followed by the sorted list.

So putting it all together:

Read n, a_list, compute a, compute d.

Check for each k in 1..n, whether for all d elements, grouped by idx mod k (since (i-1) is idx), each group has the same value.

This should work.

But wait, in the second example, the valid k's are 3 and 5. Let's see.

For k=3, the groups are:

idx 0 →0 mod3 →0 →d=1.

idx 1 →1 mod3 →1 →d=2.

idx 2 →2 mod3 →2 →d=2.

idx3 →3 mod3 →0 →d=1.

idx4 →4 mod3 →1 →d=2.

So group 0: [1,1] → same.

group1: [2,2] → same.

group2: [2] → same.

So valid.

For k=5, each group has one element. So valid.

Thus code would find these.

In terms of code, let's see for the second example.

Yes.

So the code should be correct.

Testing the third example, which has n=3 and a input [1,5,3]. The a array is [0,1,5,3]. d is [1,4,-2].

For k=3: groups are idx 0 →0 mod3 →0 →d=1. idx1 →1 mod3 →1 →d=4. idx2 →2 mod3 →2 →d=-2. All groups have one element. So valid.

Thus code works.

Now, let's look for possible optimizations. Since n is up to 1000, and the code is O(n^2), which is acceptable. So no further optimizations needed.

So the code should be:

Read n, a list, compute d.

Loop k from 1 to n, check all d's in their groups. If all same, add to list.

Then output sorted list.

So the Python code would be:

n = int(input())
a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
a = [0] + a_list  # a[0] = 0, a[1] = a_1, etc.
d = [a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n+1)]

valid_ks = []

for k in range(1, n+1):
    expected = [None] * k
    valid = True
    for idx in range(n):
        j = idx % k
        current_d = d[idx]
        if expected[j] is not None:
            if current_d != expected[j]:
                valid = False
                break
        else:
            expected[j] = current_d
    if valid:
        valid_ks.append(k)

valid_ks.sort()
print(len(valid_ks))
print(' '.join(map(str, valid_ks)))

Yes, that's the code. Let's test the sample inputs.

First sample input:

5
1 2 3 4 5

d is [1,1,1,1,1]. For any k, all groups are 1. So all k's from 1 to5 are valid. Output as per example.

Second sample input:

5
1 3 5 6 8

a is [0,1,3,5,6,8]. d is [1,2,2,1,2].

k=3:

expected is [1,2,2]. Check each idx:

idx0 →0 mod3 →0 →d=1 →expected[0] =1.

idx1 →1 mod3 →1 →d=2 →expected[1] =2.

idx2 →2 mod3 →2 →d=2 →expected[2]=2.

idx3 →3 mod3 →0 →d=1 →check 1 vs 1 → ok.

idx4 →4 mod3 →1 →d=2 → check 2 vs 2 → ok.

So valid.

k=5: each group has one element. So valid. So output [3,5].

Third sample:

3
1 5 3 →a is [0,1,5,3]. d is [1,4,-2].

For k=3:

each idx 0,1,2 mod3 → groups 0,1,2. All have unique elements. Valid. Other k's:

k=1: all must be same. 1,4,-2 are different → invalid.

k=2: groups 0 and 1.

idx0 →0 mod2 →0 →d=1.

idx1 →1 mod2 →1 →d=4.

idx2 →2 mod2 →0 →d=-2. So group 0 has 1 and -2 → invalid.

Thus only k=3 is valid.

So code should work.
