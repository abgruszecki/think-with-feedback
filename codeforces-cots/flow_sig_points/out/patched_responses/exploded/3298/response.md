<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about arranging the array a in such a way that the total fun factor is maximized. The key here is understanding how the muzzling works based on Boboniu's mood. Let's break it down.

First, the rules: On day i, if Du can speak and a_i is greater than m, he gets muted for d days. So the next d days after i, he can't speak. Otherwise, he can speak the next day. The goal is to arrange the array so that the sum of all a_i where he speaks is maximized.

So, the challenge is to arrange the elements such that whenever we place a high-value element (greater than m) in a position, it blocks the next d days. But those blocked days can be filled with elements that are either <= m or maybe even higher, but arranged in a way that their blocking periods don't interfere as much.

Wait, but elements <=m don't cause any muting. So any a_i <= m can be placed in any position, as long as they are not in a blocked day. But for a_i > m, placing them uses up d days (the current day and the next d-1 days), but they contribute a_i to the sum. So we need to choose which high elements to include and arrange them in such a way that their blocked periods don't overlap too much.

So the first step is to separate the elements into two groups: those greater than m (let's call them 'big') and those <= m (call them 'small'). Because big elements cause muting, their placement is critical. The small elements can be placed in any non-blocked day and contribute their full value.

So the maximum sum would involve selecting some subset of the big elements, arranging them in an order that their blocked periods don't overlap, and then filling the remaining days with the small elements. However, since the order can affect how the blocks are arranged, the arrangement of the big elements is crucial.

Let me think about how to arrange the big elements. Each big element takes up 1 + d days (the day it's placed and d days after it where no other big elements can be placed). Wait, no. If you place a big element on day i, then days i+1 to i+d are blocked. So the next big element can be placed earliest on day i + d + 1. So the minimal number of days required for k big elements is k*(d+1) - d. Because the first element takes 1 day, each subsequent takes d days (since after the first, each new big element adds d days). Wait, maybe that's not accurate. Let's see: the first element uses day 1 and blocks days 2, ..., 1 + d. Then the next big element can be placed on day (1 + d + 1) = d+2. So for each big element after the first, we need d+1 days. So total days needed for k big elements is 1 + (k-1)*(d+1). Because each after the first requires (d+1) days (since the previous ends at position i, the next can start at i + d + 1). So the total days would be 1 + (k-1)*(d+1) + d-1? Wait, maybe not. Let me calculate for example:

If k=2, d=2. Then first element is day 1, blocks 2 and 3. The next can be on day 4. Then blocks 5 and 6. So the total days needed for two elements is 1 (day 1) + 3 (days 4,5,6) but wait, the second element only blocks days 5 and 6. Wait, the day the element is placed is day 4, and then days 5 and 6 are blocked. So the next element after that can be on day 7.

So for k big elements, the minimal days required is k + (k-1)*d. Because each big element takes one day, and between each pair, there are d days blocked. So the first element uses day 1, blocks days 2-1+d (d days). The next big element must be placed after day 1 + d days. So day 1 + d + 1. So the total days needed is 1 + (d) + 1 + (d) ... etc. Wait, for k elements, the minimal required days is 1 + (k-1)*(d +1) - 1 = k*(d+1) -d. Not sure. Let's see:

For k=1: days needed 1. So 1*(d+1) -d = d+1 -d = 1. Correct.

k=2: 2*(d+1) -d = 2d + 2 -d = d +2. But for d=2, this gives 4. But in the example with d=2 and k=2, the days needed are 4 (days 1 and 4). But 4 is (1 + (4))? Not sure. Wait, the minimal days required is 1 + (d+1) = d+2? For k=2, that would be 1 + (d+1) (since each new big element adds d+1 days). So for k=2, it's 1 + (d+1) = d+2. For d=2, that's 4. Which matches the example. So yes, the minimal days required for k big elements is (k-1)*(d+1) +1.

Wait, 1 + (k-1)*(d+1) ?

For k=2: 1 + 1*(d+1) = d+2. Correct.

Yes. So the minimal number of days required to place k big elements is (k-1)*(d+1) +1. So the total days required is (k-1)*(d+1) +1 = k + (k-1)*d.

So, if the total days required for k big elements is <=n, then we can include those k elements. Otherwise, not.

So the problem reduces to selecting the maximum possible subset of big elements (a_i >m) such that (k-1)*(d+1) +1 <=n, and then adding all the small elements (a_i <=m) that are not in the blocked days.

Wait, but the blocked days are determined by the placement of the big elements. So when we arrange the big elements in a way that their blocked days are minimized, but how do the small elements fit in?

Alternatively, the small elements can be placed in any days that are not blocked. So the total sum is sum of selected big elements plus sum of small elements that are not in any blocked days.

But how to model this?

The key idea is that when we select k big elements, the number of blocked days is k*d. Because each big element blocks d days after it (including the day after the big element). Wait, no. Each big element placed on day i blocks days i+1 to i+d. So for each big element, the number of blocked days is min(d, n - i). But arranging them optimally (as early as possible) would minimize the total blocked days.

Wait, but in the optimal arrangement, the big elements are placed as early as possible, spaced exactly d days apart. For example, the first big element on day 1, the next on day 1 +d+1, and so on. This way, the blocked days are (d days after each big element). But when arranged this way, the blocked days don't overlap.

So for k big elements, the total number of blocked days is k*d. But in the minimal required days, the big elements are placed in such a way that their blocked days don't overlap. For example, first big element blocks days 2-1+d, the next blocks days (1+d+1)+1 to (1+d+1)+d, etc. So each big element blocks d days. So total blocked days is k*d. But wait, for the first big element, placed on day 1, the blocked days are 2,3,...,1+d. So d days. For the next big element placed on day 1+d+1 = day 2+d, the blocked days are (2+d +1) to (2+d +d). Which is another d days. So for k elements, the total blocked days is k*d.

But what if the big elements are placed in a way that the blocked days overlap? For example, if d=2 and two big elements are placed on day 1 and day 2. Then the first blocks days 2,3. The second blocks days 3,4. So overlapping days. But this is not allowed because once the second element is placed on day 2, which is blocked by the first. So that's impossible. So the arrangement must be such that each big element is placed on a day that is not blocked by any previous ones. So the optimal arrangement for maximum possible big elements is to place them as early as possible, spaced by exactly d days between them.

So in that case, the blocked days are non-overlapping, and the total is k*d blocked days.

So when we select k big elements, the minimal days required is (k-1)*(d+1) +1. Which must be <=n. So the maximum possible k is the largest integer k where (k-1)*(d+1) +1 <=n.

But how do we compute that?

Wait, (k-1)*(d+1) +1 <=n → (k-1)*(d+1) <=n-1 → k-1 <= (n-1)/(d+1) → k <= (n-1)/(d+1) +1.

So the maximum possible k is floor((n-1)/(d+1)) +1. Let's see:

For example, n=5, d=2. Then (5-1)/(2+1) =4/3=1.333... → floor is 1. So k=1+1=2. Let's check: (2-1)*(3) +1 =3+1=4 <=5. Yes. So for k=2, the required days are 4. Then if we have 2 big elements, we can place them on day 1 and day 4 (since 1+3=4). Then blocked days for the first are 2,3. For the second, 5,6 (but n=5, so only day 5). So total blocked days 2+1=3.

So the total days used for big elements are 2, and the blocked days are 3.

But the total days taken up by big elements and their blocked days is 2 (days of big elements) + 3 (blocked days) =5 days. Which equals n=5. So that's acceptable.

So the maximum k is 2 here. Which in the first example, the solution uses two big elements (15 and 23?), but wait in the first example's output, the arrangement is [15,5,8,10,23]. So 15 is a big element (15>11) placed on day 1. Then days 2 and 3 are blocked. Then day4 is 10 (<=m, so allowed). Day5 is 23 (big, placed on day5. But day5 is allowed because the previous big element was on day1, which blocks days 2 and 3. So after that, day4 is allowed. So day5 can be placed, but after placing 23, days6 and7 are blocked, but n=5. So the total blocked days here are 2 (from 15) and 0 (from 23's placement on day5). So in this case, the two big elements are 15 and 23. So k=2.

But according to the formula, maximum possible k is floor(4/3) +1=1+1=2. So yes.

So the first thing to do is to find all the big elements (a_i > m) and sort them in descending order. Because we want the largest possible elements in the big group. Then, select the top k elements (for the maximum possible k) and calculate the sum. Then, the remaining days (n - (k + (k-1)*d)) days (since (k-1)*(d+1) +1 is the days required for big elements, which is k + (k-1)*d) → but wait, (k-1)*(d+1) +1 =k-1 + (k-1)*d +1 =k + (k-1)*d. So the total days occupied by big elements and their blocked days is k + (k-1)*d. But this must be <=n.

Wait, no. Because each big element takes 1 day, and between them there are d days blocked. So for k elements, the total days used are (k-1)*(d+1) +1. Which is (k-1)*d + (k-1) +1 = (k-1)*d +k. So that's k*d -d +k → k*(d+1) -d. But for example, k=2 and d=2: 2*3 -2=6-2=4, which matches the earlier example.

So when k is the maximum possible, the total days required is (k-1)*(d+1)+1. The remaining days (n - (k-1)*(d+1)-1) days can be filled with small elements. But wait, those remaining days are the days not used by the big elements and their blocked days. So the small elements can be placed in the non-blocked days.

But how to calculate how many small elements can be added? Because the blocked days are already accounted for, the remaining days are (n - (number of days occupied by big elements and their blocked days)) → which is n - ( (k-1)*(d+1) +1 - (k*d) )? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days occupied by big elements and their blocked days is (k-1)*(d+1) +1, which is the minimal days required to place the k big elements. So the remaining days are n - (k-1)*(d+1) -1 +1 → because the days used are from 1 to (k-1)*(d+1)+1. Wait, maybe not. For example, when k=2, (2-1)*(3)+1=4. So days 1, 2, 3,4. So n=5 would have remaining days 5-4=1 day. So that day can be filled with a small element.

So the number of available days for small elements is n - ( (k-1)*(d+1) +1 ) + (k*d). Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently.

The total days used by big elements and their blocked days is:

Each big element takes 1 day to speak, and blocks d days after. So for k big elements:

sum over each big element of 1 (the speaking day) + min(d, n - day_i) blocked days.

But if arranged optimally (as early as possible), the blocked days are non-overlapping and the total is k*d. But if the last big element is placed on a day where its blocked days exceed n, then the blocked days are n - day_i.

But in the optimal arrangement, the big elements are placed as early as possible. So the first big element is day 1, next is day 1 +d+1, etc. So for k elements, the total blocked days is sum of d for each big element except the last one, and min(d, n - day_i) for the last one.

But perhaps to simplify, we can model the maximum possible blocked days as k*d, but if (k-1)*(d+1) +1 +d >n, then the last blocked days are n - ((k-1)*(d+1)+1) days.

Wait, let's take the example where k=2 and n=5, d=2. Then the first big element is placed on day1. It blocks days 2,3. The second is placed on day4. It blocks days5. So the blocked days are 3 in total. Which is 2*2 - (2 - (5-4+1)) = 4- (something). Maybe not. Alternatively, the blocked days for the second element would be 2 days (5 and 6), but n=5, so only 1 day. So in this case, the blocked days sum to 3.

So for k big elements, the total blocked days is (k-1)*d + (n - day_k) where day_k is the day the k-th big element is placed. But day_k is (k-1)*(d+1) +1. So day_k +d = (k-1)*(d+1)+1 +d = (k-1)*(d+1) +d +1 = (k) (d+1). So if (k-1)*(d+1)+1 +d <=n → k*(d+1) <=n → then the blocked days for the k-th element is d days. Otherwise, it's n - day_k.

But this complicates the calculation. However, perhaps the optimal approach is to arrange the big elements in such a way that the blocked days are all used, but perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the maximum possible k, then the sum of big elements plus all small elements except those in the blocked days.

But how?

Wait, the sum is the sum of the selected big elements plus the sum of the small elements that are placed in the days not used by big elements and not blocked by any big elements.

But the days not blocked are the days not covered by any blocked period. So the available days are:

- The days when a big element is placed (they contribute to the sum, but those days are not blocked).

Wait, no. A big element is placed on day i. That day is counted in the sum (since Du can speak that day). The blocked days are i+1 to i+d. So the day i is part of the big element's placement and is not blocked. The blocked days are the days after.

So the available days for small elements are:

All days except the days blocked by any big elements. And the days when big elements are placed can't be used for small elements.

Wait, no. The big elements are placed on their days, so those days are occupied by the big elements. The blocked days are the days after, where Du can't speak. So the small elements can be placed on any days that are not part of a blocked period and not used by a big element.

So the total available days for small elements is the total number of days (n) minus the number of days occupied by big elements (k) minus the number of blocked days (which is the sum of blocked days from each big element).

So the sum is sum_big + sum_small_available, where sum_small_available is the sum of the largest s small elements, where s is the number of available days for small elements.

So the problem now becomes:

1. Split the array into big and small elements.

2. Sort big in descending order, small in descending order.

3. Compute the maximum possible k (number of big elements to select) such that (k-1)*(d+1)+1 <=n. Let's call this max_k.

4. For each possible k from 0 to max_k:

   a. The required days for k big elements is (k-1)*(d+1) +1. But this may be less than or equal to n.

   b. The total blocked days is the sum of d days for each big element, except possibly the last one. Wait, but when the last big element's blocked days exceed n.

   So for the k-th big element placed on day i, the blocked days after it are min(d, n -i).

   So the total blocked days for k elements is (k-1)*d + min(d, n - ((k-1)*(d+1)+1)).

   The days occupied by big elements is k.

   The available days for small elements are n - k - ( (k-1)*d + min(d, n - ((k-1)*(d+1)+1 )) )

   Let's compute that:

   The available days for small elements is:

   available = n - k - blocked_days

   blocked_days = (k-1)*d + min(d, n - ( (k-1)*(d+1) +1 ) )

   But (k-1)*(d+1) +1 is the day when the last big element is placed. Let's call that day_pos = (k-1)*(d+1) +1.

   The blocked days for this last element is min(d, n - day_pos).

   So blocked_days = (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos)

   So available = n -k - [ (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos) ]

   Now, the available days must be >=0.

   Then, the maximum sum for this k is sum of top k big elements + sum of top (available) small elements.

   So for each possible k (from 0 to max_k), we can compute this sum and take the maximum.

So the algorithm steps are:

1. Separate into big and small.

2. Sort big in descending order, compute prefix sums.

3. Sort small in descending order, compute prefix sums.

4. Compute all possible k from 0 up to the maximum possible (max_k), which is floor( (n-1)/(d+1) ) +1. But need to check if (k-1)*(d+1)+1 <=n.

   For each k in 0 to possible_max_k:

   a. if k > number of big elements → skip.

   b. compute day_pos = (k-1)*(d+1) +1. If day_pos >n → then k is not possible. So we need to adjust the maximum possible k.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible k is the minimum between the number of big elements and the maximum possible k allowed by days.

So, first, the maximum possible k allowed by days is the maximum k where (k-1)*(d+1)+1 <=n. So solving for k: (k-1)*(d+1) <=n-1 → k-1 <= (n-1)/(d+1) → k <= (n-1)/(d+1)+1.

But k can't exceed the number of big elements. So the actual possible k is min( (max allowed by days), len(big) )

So in code:

max_possible_k = min( ( (n-1) // (d+1) ) + 1, len(big) )

Then, for each k in 0 to max_possible_k:

   compute day_pos = (k-1)*(d+1) +1.

   if day_pos >n → then even this k is invalid. So perhaps need to find the correct maximum k.

Wait, perhaps the initial way to compute max possible k is not entirely correct. Let's see:

For example, n=5, d=2. (k-1)*3 +1 <=5 → (k-1)*3 <=4 → k-1 <=1.333 → k<=2.333. So k can be 2. For k=2, day_pos=1*3+1=4 <=5. So valid.

Another example: n=6, d=3. (k-1)*4 +1 <=6 → (k-1)*4 <=5 →k-1<=1.25 →k<=2.25 → k=2.

For k=2, day_pos=1*4+1=5 <=6.

Yes.

So the formula for max_possible_k is correct.

But if len(big) is less than that, then we can't select more than len(big) elements.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Compute the possible k from 0 up to the minimum between len(big) and the max allowed by days.

For each such k:

   check if (k-1)*(d+1)+1 <=n. Because even if k is within len(big), the day_pos may be larger than n.

   For example, len(big) is 3, but (3-1)*(d+1)+1 may be larger than n. So in that case, even though there are enough big elements, their arrangement is impossible.

But according to the formula, the max_possible_k is already computed as the minimum between len(big) and ( (n-1)//(d+1) )+1. So for k in 0...max_possible_k, (k-1)*(d+1)+1 will be <=n.

Because (max_possible_k is the maximum k where (k-1)*(d+1)+1 <=n, and len(big) may be larger than that. So the min ensures that the k we're considering is allowed by days.

So for k in 0 to max_possible_k:

   proceed.

Now, for each k:

   sum_big = prefix_big[k]

   compute available_small_days = available = n -k - [ (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos) ]

   day_pos is (k-1)*(d+1) +1.

   blocked_days_from_last = min(d, n - day_pos)

   blocked_days = (k-1)*d + blocked_days_from_last

   available_small_days = n - k - blocked_days

   sum_small = prefix_small[ available_small_days ]

   total = sum_big + sum_small.

Then, select the maximum total over all possible k.

So, the steps:

- Split the array into big and small.

- Sort big in descending order, compute prefix sums.

- Sort small in descending order, compute prefix sums.

- Precompute the max possible k (max_k).

- Iterate k from 0 to max_k.

- For each k, compute the available_small_days.

- If available_small_days is negative, skip (but how can that be? Because n >=k + blocked_days. Let's think:

   blocked_days is (k-1)*d + blocked_days_from_last.

   day_pos is (k-1)*(d+1)+1.

   blocked_days_from_last = min(d, n - day_pos).

   So day_pos is the day of the last big element. The blocked days after that are min(d, n-day_pos). So the blocked_days can be at most (k-1)*d +d = k*d. Which is <= k*d.

   So n -k - (k*d) >= n -k -kd.

   But n >= (k-1)*(d+1)+1 → let's see:

   (k-1)*(d+1) +1 <=n → (k-1)*(d+1) <=n-1 → k-1 <= (n-1)/(d+1).

   So for example, if k=2, d=2, then (k-1)*(d+1) +1 =4 <=n=5. Then blocked_days is (2-1)*2 + min(2,5-4) = 2 +1=3. available_small_days =5-2-3=0. Which is okay.

   So available_small_days can't be negative. Because the blocked_days are computed as (k-1)*d + min(d, n-day_pos). And since day_pos is (k-1)*(d+1)+1, then n-day_pos >=0 (since day_pos <=n as per max possible k). So min(d, n-day_pos) is >=0. So blocked_days is (k-1)*d + some non-negative number. So available_small_days is n -k - blocked_days. But since the arrangement is possible, the sum of blocked_days and k days is <=n. Because the sum is k (days of big elements) + blocked_days (blocked days) <=n. Because the blocked_days are the sum of blocked days from the k big elements, which are arranged in such a way that their blocked days are within n.

   So available_small_days is >=0.

So, in code, for each k:

   sum_big = prefix_big[k] if k <= len(big) else 0.

But wait, we have to check that len(big) >=k. Because the code may have k up to min(max_possible_k, len(big)).

But since max_possible_k is the minimum between len(big) and ... So when k is in 0..max_possible_k, then len(big) >=k.

So no problem.

Similarly, the sum_small is the sum of the first available_small_days elements in the small array. If available_small_days is larger than len(small), then take all of them.

So to handle that, the prefix_small array can be of length len(small)+1, where prefix_small[i] is sum of first i elements. So if available_small_days is larger than len(small), sum_small is prefix_small[len(small)].

So, in code:

small = sorted(small_elements, reverse=True)

prefix_small = [0]*(len(small)+1)

for i in range(len(small)):

   prefix_small[i+1] = prefix_small[i] + small[i]

Then, sum_small = prefix_small[ min(available_small_days, len(small)) ]

Putting it all together.

Now, let's test this approach against the first example.

First example input:

n=5, d=2, m=11.

a = [8,10,15,23,5].

Big elements are 15,23 (since 15>11, 23>11. 8,10,5 are small).

small sorted: [10,8,5]. sum is 23.

prefix_small: [0,10, 18, 23].

Big sorted: [23,15].

prefix_big: [0,23,38].

max_possible_k: (5-1)//(2+1) +1=4//3=1 +1=2. len(big) is 2. So max_k=2.

For k=0:

sum_big=0.

available_small_days=5-0 - (0 + 0) =5. So sum_small=23. total=23.

For k=1:

sum_big=23.

day_pos =0*3+1=1.

blocked_days_from_last = min(2,5-1)=2.

blocked_days=0*2 +2=2.

available_small_days=5-1-2=2. So sum_small=10+8=18. Total=23+18=41.

For k=2:

sum_big=23+15=38.

day_pos= (2-1)*3+1=4.

blocked_days_from_last= min(2,5-4)=1.

blocked_days= (2-1)*2 +1= 2+1=3.

available_small_days=5-2-3=0. sum_small=0. total=38.

But the sample answer is 48. Wait, what's wrong here.

Wait sample answer's sum is 15+10+23=48.

In the sample arrangement, the big elements are 15 and 23. So their sum is 38. Then the small elements are 10 and 5. So sum 10+5=15. But according to the code's calculation for k=2, available_small_days=0. So sum_small=0. So how did they get 15+10+23=48?

Wait, in the sample arrangement, the sum is 15 (day1) +10 (day4) +23 (day5). So that's three elements. But according to our model, when k=2, sum_big is 15+23=38, and sum_small is 0. So why?

Ah, I see. Because in our model, the available days for small elements are the days not occupied by big elements and not blocked. But in the sample arrangement, the big elements are on day1 and day5.

Wait, in the sample arrangement:

Day1: 15 (big, blocked days 2,3).

Day5:23 (big, blocked days 6,7, which are beyond n=5.

So the blocked days are 2,3. So the available days for small elements are 4 and5.

Wait, day5 is occupied by a big element, so it's not available. The available days are days not blocked and not occupied by big elements.

So after placing the big elements on day1 and day5, the blocked days are 2,3 (from day1) and days6,7 (invalid). So the available days are 4 and day5's blocked days are beyond. But day5 is occupied by the big element. So the available days for small elements are 4 and 5? Or only day4?

Wait, the big elements are on days1 and5. The blocked days after day1 are 2,3. The blocked days after day5 are 6,7 (invalid). So the days not blocked are 4,5,6,7, etc. But days1 and5 are occupied by big elements. So the available days are 4 and5 (since day5 is occupied, it's not available for small elements). Wait, no. Small elements can be placed on days that are not blocked and not occupied by a big element.

So day4 is available (not blocked, not occupied). Day5 is occupied by a big element. So only day4 is available for small elements. So sum_small is 10 (from day4). But in the sample, they have day4 (10) and day5 (23). So the sum is 15+10+23=48.

But according to our model, when k=2, the available_small_days is 0. So how is this possible?

Ah, here's the problem. Our model is incorrect.

In the sample arrangement, there are two big elements (15 and23). The days they occupy are day1 and day5. The required days for k=2 is (2-1)*3 +1=4. So day4 is the expected day for the second big element. But in the sample, the second big is placed on day5. So our model is not considering that.

Wait, according to our model, the big elements must be placed as early as possible. But in the sample, the second big element is placed on day5, which is after day4. So the model's approach of placing the big elements as early as possible may not be the optimal way.

This indicates that our model is incorrect.

Ah, so the problem is that the initial model assumes that the big elements are placed in a way that they are spaced exactly (d+1) days apart, but in reality, arranging them in a way that allows for more small elements may yield a higher total.

So the model's approach of considering only the minimal required days for big elements (i.e., arranging them as early as possible) is not the optimal arrangement. Therefore, the model's calculation of available_small_days is incorrect.

So this approach is wrong.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because in the sample, the two big elements are placed on days1 and5. The required days for k=2 is (2-1)*(d+1) +1 =4. So the second big element should be placed on day4. But in the sample, it's placed on day5. So the model's calculation of available_small_days is wrong.

Thus, our approach has a flaw.

So why is the sample arrangement allowed?

Because in the sample arrangement, the big elements are placed on days1 and5, which requires that the first big element is on day1, and the second is placed on day5. The days between them are 1, then next big is on day5. So the spacing between the two big elements is 4 days (days1 to 5: 5-1=4 days, which is more than d+1 (d=2, d+1=3). So the blocked days after day1 are 2 and3. So day4 is unblocked and available. Then, the next big can be placed on day5, which is allowed because day5 is not blocked. So the model's approach of requiring that big elements are placed (d+1) days apart is incorrect.

This suggests that the way of placing big elements can be more flexible. The model's initial assumption that they are placed as early as possible may not be the best arrangement for maximizing the sum.

So our approach is incorrect. Therefore, the initial model's way of calculating available_small_days is wrong.

So we need to find another approach.

Alternative approach:

The key insight is that when you place a big element, you can choose any day that is not blocked by previous big elements. But the optimal arrangement is to place the big elements in such a way that after each big element, there are exactly d days of blocking. So each big element is followed by d days of blocking, but the next big element can be placed after those d days. But the model's assumption of spacing (d+1) days between big elements is not correct, because the blocked days are only the days after the big element. So for example, if a big element is placed on day i, then the next big element can be placed on day i + d +1. But in the sample, the first big is on day1, blocked days 2,3. The next big can be placed on day4 (i+3), which would block days5 and6. But in the sample, the next big is placed on day5, which is allowed.

Wait, day4 is not blocked. So placing the big element on day4 would block days5 and6. Then day5 is blocked. So in the sample's arrangement, the big element is placed on day5, which is unblocked. So in that case, the blocked days are 6 and7, which are beyond n=5.

So the problem is that the model's approach forces the big elements to be placed in a way that uses the minimal possible days, but in reality, placing them later allows for more small elements to be placed in the available days.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect. So how can we model the optimal arrangement for the big elements to maximize the sum?

Alternative idea:

The best arrangement is to place all big elements as late as possible. This would allow as many small elements as possible to be placed before the big elements, thereby filling the days and not using up available days for small elements.

But this seems counterintuitive. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal arrangement is to arrange the big elements in a way that allows the maximum number of small elements. But how?

This problem is tricky. Let's re-examine the sample.

Sample 1:

n=5, d=2, m=11.

Big elements are 15 and23.

The optimal arrangement is [15,5,8,10,23]. So days1 (15) blocks days2 and3. The next big is on day5 (23), which is allowed. So days4 and5 are not blocked by the first big element. So the available days for small elements are days4 (10) and day5 is the big element. So sum_small is 10. So sum_big is15+23=38, sum_small 10. Total 48.

According to the model's calculation for k=2, sum_big is38, sum_small is0. So how is this discrepancy possible?

Because the model assumes that the two big elements are placed on days1 and4, which uses days1,4 and blocks days2,3,5,6. But in the sample, the big elements are on days1 and5. So in this case, the blocked days are 2,3 (from day1), and days6,7 (from day5, which are beyond n=5). So the blocked days are 2 days (2 and3). So the available days for small elements are 4 and5. But day5 is occupied by a big element, so only day4 is available. So available_small_days is1.

But according to the model's calculation:

k=2.

day_pos= (2-1)*3 +1=4.

blocked_days_from_last= min(2,5-4)=1.

blocked_days= (2-1)*2 +1= 2+1=3.

available_small_days=5-2-3=0.

So sum_small is0. But in reality, when placing the big elements in a different way, the available_small_days is1. So the model's approach is wrong.

So what's the problem here?

Ah, the model's approach assumes that the big elements are placed in a way that uses the minimal possible days (days1, day4), but in reality, the big elements can be placed on days1 and5. This allows for more small elements to be placed, which the model doesn't account for.

So the model's way of calculating the available_small_days is incorrect because it assumes a certain arrangement of the big elements, but other arrangements may result in more available days.

Thus, the initial approach is flawed.

This suggests that the problem is more complex and requires a different approach.

Alternative approach:

The total number of days taken up by k big elements and their blocked days is k + (d * (k)) - (d - (n - (start_day of last big element +d))). Or perhaps not. Alternatively, for each big element, the blocked days are min(d, n - day_i). So the total blocked days is sum over each big element of min(d, n - day_i).

But the problem is that the day_i (the days when big elements are placed) can vary. So the minimal blocked days would be when the big elements are placed as early as possible, but the maximal available days for small elements would be when the big elements are placed as late as possible.

Wait, no. Because placing a big element later allows the small elements to be placed before, but the blocked days after the big element are still blocked. For example, placing a big element on day5 would block days6-5+d=5+2=7 (but n=5). So no blocked days. So in that case, the big element contributes 0 blocked days.

So to maximize the available days for small elements, we should arrange the big elements in such a way that their blocked days are minimized. So that means placing big elements as late as possible. Because the later a big element is placed, the fewer days it can block (since after n, there are no days to block).

So the optimal arrangement for maximizing available_small_days is to place the big elements as late as possible, thereby reducing their blocked days.

So the model's initial approach of placing the big elements as early as possible is the worst case for available_small_days. To maximize available_small_days, we should arrange the big elements as late as possible.

But this complicates the model, since the way the big elements are arranged affects the available_small_days.

Thus, the correct approach must find the optimal arrangement of big elements that maximizes the sum of big elements plus the sum of as many small elements as possible.

But how to model this?

Alternative idea:

The optimal arrangement is to place the big elements in such a way that each big element is placed as late as possible, to minimize the blocked days. But how?

For example, for k big elements, we can place them starting from the end of the array, leaving as much space as possible before them.

For example, the last big element is placed on day n. It blocks days n+1 to n+d, which are beyond n. So no blocked days. The previous big element is placed on day n - (d+1), etc.

This way, each big element is placed in such a way that they are as far to the end as possible, blocking as few days as possible.

This arrangement would minimize the total blocked days, thus maximizing the available days for small elements.

So for k big elements, when placed as late as possible, the days they occupy are:

day n - (k-1)*(d+1) +1 (but I need to think carefully).

Alternatively, the first big element is placed on day (n - (k-1)*(d+1)), and each subsequent big element is placed (d+1) days before the next.

For example, for k=2 and d=2, n=5:

The first big element is placed on day5 - (2-1)*(2+1) =5-3=2. So days2 and 5.

Wait, no. Let's think for k=2:

We need to place two big elements with at least d+1 days between them. But since we are placing them as late as possible, the first big element is placed on day5, the next on day5 - (d+1) =5-3=2.

But day5 is after day2. So the order would be day2 and day5. The first big element is on day2, which blocks days3,4. The next is on day5, which blocks days6,7. So blocked days are 3,4. So total blocked days is 2 days. But in the sample, the blocked days are 2,3. So this arrangement uses two big elements and blocked days of 2 days. The available_small_days is5 -2 (k=2) -2 (blocked) =1. So sum_small=5 (max small element is10, but available_small_days=1: sum is10).

But in the sample, the sum_small is10 (day4) and 5 (day2). Wait, no. The small elements are placed in days1,4,5. But if the big elements are on days2 and5:

- Day2 is big, blocks3,4.

- Day5 is big, blocks6,7.

Available days for small are days1 and5 is occupied. So available days are day1 and4.

Wait, day2 is big, so days1 is available. Days3 and4 are blocked. Day5 is big, but day4 is blocked. So available days are1 and4. So available_small_days=2. So sum_small is10+8=18. Sum_big is15+23=38. Total 56. Which is higher than the sample's 48. But in the sample's arrangement, sum is48.

Hmm, this suggests that the arrangement where big elements are placed as late as possible could yield a higher sum.

But this contradicts the sample's solution. So perhaps there's a mistake in the reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal arrangement depends on both the sum of big elements and the sum of small elements that can fit into the available days. But how to model this.

This suggests that the correct approach is to compute for each possible k (number of big elements), the minimal possible blocked days. Then, for each k, compute the maximum possible sum of big elements (top k) plus the sum of the top s small elements, where s is n -k - blocked_days, and blocked_days is the minimal possible for that k.

So, for each k:

   minimal_blocked_days = ?

The minimal_blocked_days is the minimum possible blocked days when placing k big elements. Which would be achieved by placing them as late as possible.

How to calculate this minimal_blocked_days.

If we place k big elements as late as possible, the blocked days would be:

The first big element is placed on day n, which blocks 0 days.

The second big element is placed on day n - (d+1), which blocks days up to n - (d+1) +d =n-1. So the blocked days are (n - (d+1) +1) to n-1 → which is d days.

But if n - (d+1) <1, then this is not possible.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think recursively.

When placing the big elements as late as possible, each big element after the first is placed (d+1) days before the previous one.

So the first big element is placed on day n.

The second on day n - (d+1).

The third on day n - 2*(d+1).

etc.

This way, the blocked days are maximally covered by the previous big elements.

But for this to be possible, all these days must be >=1.

The total days required for k big elements in this arrangement is (k-1)*(d+1) +1. For example, the first element is at day n, the next at n - (d+1), etc. The last element would be at day n - (k-1)*(d+1). This must be >=1.

So the minimal possible blocked days for k big elements arranged as late as possible is the sum of the blocked days from each big element.

Each big element placed on day i will block days i+1 to i+d. But when placed as late as possible:

The first big element on day n blocks 0 days (since i+1 =n+1 >n).

The second big element on day n - (d+1) blocks days (n - (d+1) +1) to (n - (d+1) +d) → n -d to n -1. Which is d days.

The third big element on day n - 2*(d+1) blocks days (n-2*(d+1)+1) to (n-2*(d+1)+d) → n-2d-2 +1 =n-2d-1 +d → n-2d-1 +d =n-d-1. So blocked days from day n-2d-1 to day n-d-1. But if n-2d-1 <1, then the blocked days are up to n.

Wait, this is getting too complex. Perhaps the minimal blocked days for k big elements arranged as late as possible is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} min(d, n - (n - i*(d+1)) ) → which simplifies to sum_{i=0}^{k-1} min(d, i*(d+1) - (n - (n - i*(d+1)) )) → not sure.

Alternatively, when placing k big elements as late as possible, the first is placed at position n, the second at n - (d+1), third at n - 2*(d+1), and so on.

The blocked days for each element i (starting from 0):

The i-th element is placed at day n - i*(d+1).

The blocked days are days (n - i*(d+1) + 1) to (n - i*(d+1) +d).

The number of blocked days is max(0, min(d, n - (n - i*(d+1) +1) +1 )) → which is min(d, n - (n - i*(d+1) +1) +1) = min(d, i*(d+1) -1 +1) = min(d, i*(d+1)).

So for the i-th element (i starting from 0), the blocked days are min(d, i*(d+1)).

Wait, this is not correct.

Wait, for the first element (i=0): day n. blocked days are n+1 to n+d → none. So min(d, 0*(d+1))=0. Correct.

For the second element (i=1): day n - (d+1). blocked days are (n - (d+1) +1) to (n - (d+1)+d) → n -d to n -1. The number of days blocked is d days. So min(d, 1*(d+1)) → min(d, d+1) =d. Correct.

Third element (i=2): day n - 2*(d+1). blocked days are (n-2d-2 +1) to (n-2d-2 +d) → n-2d-1 to n-2d-2 +d → n-2d-1 to n-d-2.

The number of days blocked is (n-d-2) - (n-2d-1) +1 = (-d-2 +2d+1) +1 =d-1 +1= d days. So min(d, 2*(d+1))=d. So again, it's correct.

So for each element i (0-based), the blocked days are min(d, (i)*(d+1)).

So the total blocked days for k elements arranged as late as possible is sum_{i=0 to k-1} min(d, i*(d+1)).

But this sum may not be easy to compute for large k.

But perhaps there's a pattern here.

For example, for i where i*(d+1) <=d → which is i=0 and i=1 (if d>=1).

But for i>=1:

i*(d+1) could be larger than d.

Wait, for i=1: 1*(d+1) =d+1 >d. So min(d, d+1) isd.

So for i>=1, min(d, i*(d+1)) is d.

So the sum for k elements is:

min(d,0*(d+1)) + sum_{i=1 to k-1} min(d, i*(d+1)).

= 0 + (k-1)*d.

Thus, the total blocked days for k elements arranged as late as possible is (k-1)*d.

Wait, but that's the same as the previous model's calculation for blocked days when the big elements are placed as early as possible.

But that's not correct. For example, when placing k elements as late as possible, the first element contributes 0 blocked days, the next k-1 elements contribute d days each. So total is (k-1)*d.

This is the same as the previous model's calculation.

But in the sample, when k=2 and big elements are placed as late as possible (days5 and 2):

The first element (day5) contributes 0 blocked days. The second (day5-3=2) contributes min(2, 3) =2 days. So blocked_days=0+2=2.

Thus, available_small_days =5-2 (k=2) -2 (blocked_days) =1. So sum_small=10.

Sum_big=23+15=38. Total 48.

Which matches the sample's output.

But according to the previous model's calculation for k=2, sum_small is0, but when arranged as late as possible, sum_small is10.

This suggests that the model's initial approach is incorrect because it assumes that the big elements are placed as early as possible, which leads to a higher number of blocked days. But when placed as late as possible, the blocked days are (k-1)*d, which is the same as when placed as early as possible.

Wait, in the model's initial approach, for k=2, the blocked_days is (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos), where day_pos is (k-1)*(d+1)+1.

So for k=2, day_pos is (2-1)*3 +1=4.

blocked_days_from_last = min(2,5-4)=1.

blocked_days= (2-1)*2 +1= 2+1=3.

available_small_days=5-2-3=0.

But when arranged as late as possible, blocked_days is (k-1)*d=2-1)*2=2.

available_small_days=5-2-2=1.

So how to account for this discrepancy?

Ah, because the initial model calculates blocked_days as (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos). But when big elements are placed as late as possible, the blocked_days is (k-1)*d.

But according to the initial model's calculation for k=2, the blocked_days is3. But when placed as late as possible, it's2.

So the initial model's approach of computing blocked_days as (k-1)*d + min(d, n - day_pos) is incorrect. The correct blocked_days for k big elements arranged as late as possible is (k-1)*d.

Thus, the model's initial approach is incorrect. So the correct way to compute the available_small_days is:

available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

Because when arranged as late as possible, the total blocked days is (k-1)*d.

Thus, the correct formula for available_small_days when the big elements are arranged as late as possible is:

available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

But we need to ensure that this value is non-negative.

So for each k:

sum_big = sum of top k big elements.

available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

sum_small = sum of top available_small_days small elements.

But wait, in the sample case:

k=2, available_small_days=5-2- (2-1)*2=5-2-2=1.

So sum_small is10.

sum_big is15+23=38. Total 48.

Which matches the sample.

So this suggests that the correct approach is to arrange the big elements as late as possible, thus the available_small_days is n -k - (k-1)*d.

But we need to verify if k big elements can be placed as late as possible.

The condition for placing k big elements as late as possible is that the first element's day is >=1.

The first element is placed on day n.

The second on day n - (d+1).

Third on day n - 2*(d+1), etc.

The earliest day any big element can be placed is 1.

So the day of the k-th big element (the earliest one) is n - (k-1)*(d+1).

This must be >=1.

So n - (k-1)*(d+1) >=1 → (k-1)*(d+1) <=n-1 →k-1 <= (n-1)/(d+1) → k <= (n-1)/(d+1) +1.

Which is the same as the initial model's maximum possible k.

Thus, the initial model's maximum possible k is correct.

So the correct approach is:

For each k from 0 to max_possible_k (the same as before), compute available_small_days as n -k - (k-1)*d.

If available_small_days is >=0, then sum_small is the sum of the top available_small_days small elements.

Otherwise, sum_small is0.

But wait, in the initial model's example where k=2 and the big elements are placed as early as possible, available_small_days would be 0. But when placed as late as possible, it's1.

So the correct formula is available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

Thus, the initial model's approach was incorrect because it calculated available_small_days based on the assumption that big elements are placed as early as possible, but the correct way is to assume they are placed as late as possible.

Thus, the correct approach is:

For each k in 0 to max_possible_k:

   available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

   if available_small_days <0 → skip (sum_small=0).

   sum_small = sum of top available_small_days small elements.

   sum_big = sum of top k big elements.

   total = sum_big + sum_small.

We need to find the maximum total over all possible k.

But we need to ensure that the big elements can be placed as late as possible, which requires that the first big element's day is >=1. Which is ensured by the maximum possible k being (n-1)/(d+1)+1.

Thus, this approach is correct.

Let's test this with the sample.

Sample1:

k=2.

available_small_days=5-2- (2-1)*2=5-2-2=1.

sum_small=10 (top 1 small element).

sum_big=15+23=38.

total=48. Correct.

Another example, the initial model's arrangement for k=2:

available_small_days is 1.

sum_small=10.

So the total is38+10=48.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, this is the correct approach.

So the steps are:

1. Separate big and small elements.

2. Sort big in descending order, compute prefix sums.

3. Sort small in descending order, compute prefix sums.

4. Compute max_possible_k = min( len(big), (n-1)//(d+1) +1 )

5. For k from 0 to max_possible_k:

   a. available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

   b. if available_small_days <0 → continue.

   c. sum_big = prefix_big[k] (if k<= len(big)).

   d. sum_small = prefix_small[ min(available_small_days, len(small)) ]

   e. total = sum_big + sum_small.

   f. keep track of the maximum total.

Thus, the code must be modified to use this new formula for available_small_days.

Let's see another example.

Sample2:

Input:

20 2 16

a = [20,5,8,2,18,16,2,16,16,1,5,16,2,13,6,16,4,17,21,7]

Big elements are those >16: 20, 18, 17,21.

Sorted big:21,20,18,17.

Small elements: the rest. Sorted in descending order.

Let's compute for k=4.

max_possible_k = (20-1)/3 +1 =19/3=6 → 6+1=7. But len(big)=4. So max_possible_k=4.

available_small_days =20-4 -3*2=20-4-6=10.

sum_big=21+20+18+17=76.

sum_small is sum of top 10 small elements.

Small elements sorted in descending order:

16 (appears 4 times?), wait the input array is:

a = [20,5,8,2,18,16,2,16,16,1,5,16,2,13,6,16,4,17,21,7]

Wait, the big elements are those >16:20,18,17,21.

So small elements are 5,8,2,16,2,16,16,1,5,16,2,13,6,16,4,7.

Wait, no:

Original a array:

Looking at each element:

20: >16 → big.

5: small.

8: small.

2: small.

18: big.

16: small (16= m=16? No, m is 16. So a_i must be >m. So 16 is not big.

16 is small.

2: small.

16: small.

16: small.

1: small.

5: small.

16: small.

2: small.

13: small.

6: small.

16: small.

4: small.

17: big.

21: big.

7: small.

So the small elements are:

5,8,2,16,2,16,16,1,5,16,2,13,6,16,4,7.

Sorted in descending order:

16,16,16,16,13,8,7,6,5,5,4,2,2,2,1.

Wait, count how many 16's:

In the small elements, 16 appears in positions a[5], a[7], a[8], a[9], a[14], a[15]. Wait:

Original array:

Indices:

0:20 → big.

1:5 → small.

2:8 → small.

3:2 → small.

4:18 → big.

5:16 → small.

6:2 → small.

7:16 → small.

8:16 → small.

9:1 → small.

10:5 → small.

11:16 → small.

12:2 → small.

13:13 → small.

14:6 → small.

15:16 → small.

16:4 → small.

17:17 → big.

18:21 → big.

19:7 → small.

So small elements are:

5,8,2,16,2,16,16,1,5,16,2,13,6,16,4,7.

That's 16 elements.

Sorted in descending order:

16,16,16,16,13,8,7,6,5,5,4,2,2,2,1,7 → wait, the last element is 7? Or wait, the small elements are:

After including all:

16 appears 5 times (indices 5,7,8,11,15).

Wait:

Index5:16.

Index7:16.

Index8:16.

Index11:16.

Index15:16.

So 5 times.

Other elements:

5,8,2,2,1,5,2,13,6,4,7.

So sorted small elements:

16,16,16,16,16,13,8,7,6,5,5,4,2,2,2,1.

Sum of these sorted.

prefix_small for available_small_days=10 would be sum of first 10: 16*5 +13+8+7+6+5= 80+13=93+8=101+7=108+6=114+5=119. So sum_small=119.

sum_big=21+20+18+17=76.

Total=76+119=195. Which matches the sample's output.

Thus, the approach is correct.

So the code should be written with this new formula for available_small_days.

Now, the code:

We need to:

- Split into big and small.

- Sort big in descending order.

- Sort small in descending order.

- Compute prefix sums for both.

- Compute max_possible_k as the minimum between len(big) and ((n-1)//(d+1)) +1.

- Iterate k from 0 to max_possible_k.

- For each k, compute available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d.

- if available_small_days <0: continue.

- sum_big is sum of first k elements of big (prefix_big[k]).

- sum_small is sum of first min(available_small_days, len(small)) elements of small.

- compute total and track the maximum.

So, the code:

Read n, d, m.

a = list of integers.

big = [x for x in a if x >m]

small = [x for x in a if x <=m]

sort big in descending order.

sort small in descending order.

pre_big = [0]*(len(big)+1)

for i in range(len(big)):

    pre_big[i+1] = pre_big[i] + big[i]

pre_small = [0]*(len(small)+1)

for i in range(len(small)):

    pre_small[i+1] = pre_small[i] + small[i]

max_possible_k = min( ((n-1) // (d+1)) +1, len(big) )

max_total = 0

for k in range(0, max_possible_k+1):

    available_small_days = n - k - (k-1)*d

    if available_small_days <0:

        continue

    sum_big = pre_big[k]

    sum_small = pre_small[ min(available_small_days, len(small)) ]

    total = sum_big + sum_small

    if total > max_total:

        max_total = total

print(max_total)

Wait, but in Python, for the range, since we need to include k up to max_possible_k, but the for loop is range(0, max_possible_k+1), since range is exclusive on the upper bound.

For example, if max_possible_k is 2, the loop is for k in 0,1,2.

Yes.

But in the case where k is 0, available_small_days =n -0 - (-1)*d → n +d?

But k=0 is allowed. available_small_days= n-0 - (0-1)*d =n +d.

But since k=0, the available_small_days can be up to n, which is allowed.

For example, k=0: available_small_days =n +d -0 - (-1)*d =n +d.

But that's not correct. Wait, for k=0:

available_small_days =n -0 - (0-1)*d →n -0 - (-d) →n +d.

But available_small_days is the number of days available for small elements. But the maximum possible days is n, since there are n days. So when k=0, the available_small_days is min(n+d, n) →n.

So in code, available_small_days can be up to n. But in the code, available_small_days is set to n -k - (k-1)*d. For k=0:

n -0 - (-1)*d →n +d.

But this is larger than n, so we need to cap it at n.

But wait, when k=0, all days are available for small elements because there are no big elements. So available_small_days is n.

Thus, the code should cap available_small_days to min(available_small_days, n -k).

But why?

Because available_small_days is n -k - (k-1)*d.

But for k=0, this is n +d. Which is larger than n.

But in reality, there are n days available for small elements when k=0.

So the code should take available_small_days = min(available_small_days, n -k).

But wait, n -k is the number of days not occupied by big elements.

Because k is the number of big elements, so the days occupied by big elements is k. So n -k days are available. But some of those may be blocked.

But according to the new approach, available_small_days is n -k - (k-1)*d.

But when k=0, this is n +d. Which is incorrect.

So the formula is only valid when k>=1.

Thus, there's a problem in the formula when k=0.

But when k=0, all days are available for small elements, since there are no big elements. So available_small_days =n.

Thus, for k=0, available_small_days should be n.

But according to the formula:

available_small_days =n -0 - (-1)*d =n +d.

Which is incorrect.

So to fix this, the code should cap available_small_days at n -k.

Because available_small_days can't exceed the number of days not occupied by big elements, which is n -k.

Thus, the correct formula is:

available_small_days = min( n -k, n -k - (k-1)*d )

But when k=0:

n -k =n.

n -k - (k-1)*d =n +d.

min(n, n+d) =n. Correct.

For k>=1:

n -k - (k-1)*d may be less than n -k.

So the formula should be:

available_small_days = max(0, min( n -k, n -k - (k-1)*d ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to compute:

available_small_days = n -k - (k-1)*d

but then clamp it between 0 and n -k.

Thus, in code:

available_small_days = max(0, min(n -k, available_small_days_raw) )

But available_small_days_raw =n -k - (k-1)*d.

But when k=0:

available_small_days_raw =n +d.

 min(n -0, available_small_days_raw) → min(n, n+d) =n.

max(0, n) →n.

Which is correct.

For k=2 in sample1:

available_small_days_raw =5-2-1*2=1.

min(5-2=3,1) →1.

max(0,1) →1.

Correct.

Another example: k=0, n=5, d=2.

available_small_days_raw=5+2=7.

min(5,7)=5.

max(0,5)=5. Correct.

Thus, the code should be modified to:

available_small_days = max(0, min(n -k, n -k - (k-1)*d))

But this may be redundant. Let's see:

n -k - (k-1)*d = (n -k) -d*(k-1).

But if this is larger than n-k, then it's possible, but when k=0:

(n -0) - (-1)*d →n +d.

Which is larger than n-k= n.

So the min is needed.

Thus, the code should be:

available_small_days_raw = n -k - (k-1)*d

available_small_days = max(0, min( n -k, available_small_days_raw ) )

But wait, n -k is the maximum possible available_small_days (all days not occupied by big elements and not blocked).

But in the case where available_small_days_raw is larger than n -k, we can't have more than n -k days.

Thus, the code should clamp it to min(n -k, available_small_days_raw).

But available_small_days_raw can also be negative, so max(0, ...).

Thus, the code for available_small_days is:

available_small_days = max(0, min(n -k, n -k - (k-1)*d))

But wait, when k=0:

n -k is 5, available_small_days_raw is 5 +d. So min(5,5+d)=5.

max(0,5)=5.

For k=2, n=5:

n-k=3.

available_small_days_raw=1.

min(3,1) →1.

max(0,1)=1.

Thus, the code should use this formula.

So in code:

available_small_days = max(0, min(n -k, n -k - (k-1)*d))

Thus, the code should be modified as such.

But in the sample1, when k=2, available_small_days is 1, which is correct.

In the initial code, when k=0:

available_small_days =n +d →n+2=7.

But after clamping, it's min(5,7) →5. So sum_small is sum of top5 small elements (10,8,5,5, ...).

But wait, the small elements in sample1 are [10,8,5], sorted. So sum_small is 10+8+5=23. Which is correct.

Thus, with this modification, the code will correctly handle all cases.

Thus, the code should be:

Read n, d, m.

Read a.

big = sorted([x for x in a if x >m], reverse=True)

small = sorted([x for x in a if x <=m], reverse=True)

pre_big = [0]

for num in big:

    pre_big.append(pre_big[-1] + num)

pre_small = [0]

for num in small:

    pre_small.append(pre_small[-1] + num)

max_possible_k = min( (n-1) // (d+1) +1, len(big) )

max_total = 0

for k in range(0, max_possible_k +1):

    available_small_days_raw = n -k - (k-1)*d

    available_small_days = max(0, min(n -k, available_small_days_raw))

    sum_big = pre_big[k] if k <= len(big) else 0

    sum_small = pre_small[ min(available_small_days, len(small)) ]

    current_total = sum_big + sum_small

    if current_total > max_total:

        max_total = current_total

print(max_total)

But wait, when k exceeds len(big), which can't happen since max_possible_k is min(..., len(big)). So the code can safely use pre_big[k].

Thus, the code is correct.

Sample2:

k=4:

available_small_days_raw =20-4 -3*2=20-4-6=10.

available_small_days is min(20-4=16, 10) →10.

sum_small is pre_small[10], which is sum of first 10 elements of sorted small (16,16,16,16,16,13,8,7,6,5) → sum is 16*5=80 +13+8+7+6+5=39 → total 80+39=119.

sum_big is21+20+18+17=76.

Total 76+119=195.

Thus, correct.

Thus, the code should work.
