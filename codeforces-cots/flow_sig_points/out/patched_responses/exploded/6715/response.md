Okay, let's see. The problem is to check if a given string can be formed by the process described. So the steps are: first, A adds some 'a's, then B adds some 'b's, then C adds some 'c's. Also, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). But there are some conditions.

First, the string must start with a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. So the string can't have any 'a's after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after a 'c'. So the first check is to see if the string is in the form a^+ b^+ c^+.

So first, we need to split the string into three parts: the a's part, then the b's part, then the c's part. If there's any character that breaks this order, the answer is immediately NO.

Once the structure is correct, we need to check:

1. The counts of a, b, c must all be at least 1. Because the problem statement says that after B appends, there's at least one a and one b. And then C appends some c's (so at least one). So if any of a_count, b_count, c_count is zero, it's invalid.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. So yes, all three counts must be >=1.

Then, the number of c's (c_count) must be equal to a_count or b_count. So we check if c_count equals a_count or equals b_count.

So the steps are:

1. Check that the string starts with one or more a's, followed by one or more b's, followed by one or more c's. If not, return NO.

2. Check that the count of a, b, c are all >=1.

3. Check that the count of c is equal to a or b.

If all these are true, return YES, else NO.

So, how to split the string into a, b, c parts?

We can iterate through the string and check the order. For example:

- The first character must be 'a'. Then, after all a's, the next characters must be 'b's. Then, after all b's, the rest must be 'c's.

So, let's find the indices where the transitions from a to b and from b to c happen.

We can track the current part. The string starts in a's part. Then transitions to b's, then to c's. Once in c's part, any other character is invalid.

Another approach: iterate through each character and check the order. For example, once a 'b' is encountered, all previous must be a's and the next characters must be b's or c's. Once a 'c' is encountered, all previous after that must be c's.

Alternatively, we can split the string into three segments:

The a's are a prefix of 'a's. Then the b's start, and after that, the c's start.

So:

Find the first occurrence of 'b' or 'c' after the initial a's. All a's are up to the first non-a. Then, from that point, check that all are 'b's until the first 'c' (or end). Then from that point, check that all are 'c's.

But how?

Let me think of the process step by step.

Check that the string starts with at least one 'a'. Then, after the a's, comes a section of 'b's. Then a section of 'c's. So:

- All characters must be in the order a, then b, then c. So, any occurrence of a after a b is invalid. Any occurrence of a or b after a c is invalid.

So perhaps:

Check that the first character is 'a'. Then, the first transition is from a to b. Then, the next transition is from b to c.

For example, in the string 'aaabccc':

a's are the first 3, then 'b's (1), then 'c's (3). So the transitions are at index 3 (from a to b) and index 4 (from b to c).

But in the string 'aabc', the transitions are after the first two a's, then a 'b', then 'c's. Wait, 'aabc' is a, a, then b, then c. So the a's are first two, then one b, then one c.

So how to check this:

We can split the string into three parts. Let's see:

a_part: all leading a's.

Then, the remaining part must start with b's (at least one), then followed by c's (at least one).

So, first, the a_part must be non-empty.

Then, the remaining string (after a_part) must start with a non-empty b_part, followed by a non-empty c_part.

So, the steps are:

1. Check that the string starts with 'a's. The first character is 'a'.

   a_end = index where the a's end (the first character that is not 'a').

   If a_end is 0 (like if the first character is not 'a'), then invalid.

   For example, the string 'baac' would fail here.

   Then, the b_part starts at a_end. The next part must be all 'b's. Find the b_end: the index where the 'b's end.

   So from a_end to b_end-1, all are 'b's. Then from b_end onwards, all are 'c's.

   So:

   a_count = a_end (since the a's are from 0 to a_end-1 inclusive).

   Then, check that the next part (from a_end) is all 'b's until some point. Let's find the first index after a_end that is not 'b'. Let's call this b_end.

   Then, the part from a_end to b_end-1 must be non-empty (so b_count >=1). Then, the rest (from b_end to end) must be all 'c's, and non-empty.

   So:

   For the string to be valid:

   - a_count >=1.

   - b_count = (b_end - a_end) >=1.

   - c_count = len(s) - b_end >=1.

   And all characters from a_end to b_end-1 must be 'b's.

   All characters from b_end to end must be 'c's.

So, to check this:

We can iterate through the string and find where the transitions happen.

Another approach is to split the string into parts:

First, find the a_part. The a_part is the maximum possible prefix of 'a's.

So a_part ends at the first index where s[i] != 'a'.

If a_part is zero-length (i.e., the first character is not 'a'), then invalid.

Then, the next part is the b_part. It starts at a_part's end and continues until the first 'c' is found. All characters in the b_part must be 'b's.

If the b_part is zero-length (i.e., after a_part ends, the next character is not 'b'), then invalid.

Then, the remaining part must be all 'c's. So, check that all remaining characters are 'c's.

If any of these steps fail, then the answer is NO.

Once the structure is valid, then check the counts:

a_count = len(a_part)

b_count = len(b_part)

c_count = len(c_part)

Check that c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.

So, code steps:

Read the string.

Check the structure.

If structure is invalid, output NO.

Else, check counts:

if a_count >=1 and b_count >=1 and c_count >=1, and (c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count), then YES else NO.

So, how to implement the structure check?

Let's code this:

Initialize a_end to 0.

Loop through the string until the first character that's not 'a'. a_end is the index where 'a's end.

If a_end is 0 (no a's), return NO.

Then, from a_end onwards, check the next part is all 'b's. Find the first index where it's not 'b'. That's b_end.

If the next character after a_end is not 'b' (so a_end is at the end of the string, or s[a_end] is not 'b'), then invalid.

Wait, for example, if the string is 'aaccc', then after the a's (a_end=2), the next character is 'c', which is invalid. So the code would catch that.

So, after a_end, the next characters must be 'b's until the first 'c'.

Wait, but the b's part is a contiguous block of 'b's. Then the c's part is a contiguous block of 'c's.

So:

Once a_end is found, the next part (starting at a_end) must be all 'b's, followed by all 'c's.

So:

After a_end, let's loop through until we find the first character that's not 'b'. Let that be b_end.

If b_end is a_end, then there are zero 'b's, which is invalid.

Then, from b_end to the end, all characters must be 'c's.

So code steps:

Third example: 'aabc'.

a_end is 2 (indices 0,1 are 'a's). Then, next is 'b' at index 2. Then, check for 'b's: index 2 is 'b', then index 3 is 'c'. So b_end is 3. So b_count is 3-2=1. Then, from index 3 to 3 (since length is 4) is 'c's. c_count is 1. So check c_count (1) equals a_count (2) or b_count (1). 1 ==1, so YES.

Another test case: 'abcc'. The a_end is 1. Then the next part is 'b's. The next character is 'b' (index 1), then next is 'c'. So b_end is 2. So b_count is 1. Then the c part is 2 characters. So c_count is 2. Check if 2 equals a_count (1) or b_count (1). No. So output is NO.

Another test case: 'abbc'. The structure is a followed by bb followed by c. So a_count=1, b_count=2, c_count=1. Check if c_count (1) equals a_count (1). Yes. So output YES.

Wait, but c_count is 1. So a_count is 1, which is equal. So yes.

But in this case, the problem says that after B appends, there must be at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's (equal to a or b count). So in this case, after B appends, the string is 'abb' (a_count 1, b_count 2). Then C appends 1 c (equal to a_count). So valid.

So the code would output YES.

Another test case: 'abc'. Then a_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=1. c_count equals both a and b. So YES.

Another test case: 'aaabbbccc'. a=3, b=3, c=3. So c_count equals both. YES.

Another case where structure is correct but c_count is wrong: 'aaabbbc'. a=3, b=3, c=1. So c is 1, which is neither 3 nor 3. So output NO.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

What about a case where a is followed by c? Like 'accc'. Then, the a_end is 1. Then, the next character is 'c'. So in the b_end loop, since after a_end (1), s[1] is 'c', which is not 'b', so b_end remains a_end (1). So b_end -a_end =0. So code checks if b_count is zero. Yes, so output NO.

Another example: 'aabba'. The structure is a's followed by 'b's followed by 'a's. So after the initial a's (a_end=2), the next characters are 'b's. Let's see:

s = 'aabba'

a_end is 2 (indices 0 and 1 are 'a's, index 2 is 'b').

Then, loop from a_end (2) to find next non-b.

At index 2: 'b' â†’ increment.

index3: 'b' â†’ increment.

index4: 'a' â†’ exit loop. b_end=4.

Then, check from index4 to end (which is 4) for 'c's. The character is 'a', so invalid. So code returns NO.

So the code correctly handles this.

So the code seems to cover all cases.

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum length is 5000. The code's time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n=5000. The code uses O(1) variables and loops, so memory is also acceptable.

Therefore, the code should be correct.

```python
s = input().strip()
n = len(s)
a_end = 0

# Find the end of the 'a's section
while a_end < n and s[a_end] == 'a':
    a_end += 1

if a_end == 0:
    print("NO")
    exit()

# Find the end of the 'b's section
b_end = a_end
while b_end < n and s[b_end] == 'b':
    b_end += 1

if b_end == a_end:
    print("NO")
    exit()

# Check remaining characters are all 'c's
for i in range(b_end, n):
    if s[i] != 'c':
        print("NO")
        exit()

a_count = a_end
b_count = b_end - a_end
c_count = n - b_end

if a_count == 0 or b_count == 0 or c_count == 0:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES" if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count else "NO")
```
