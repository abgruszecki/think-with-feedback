Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find, given a number r, two positive integers x and y such that H(x,y) = x² + 2xy + x + 1 equals r. And we need the smallest possible x if there are multiple solutions. If none exist, output NO.

Hmm, first, let's understand the equation. Let's rearrange it to find possible expressions for y in terms of x and r. 

The equation is x² + 2xy + x +1 = r. Let's solve for y.

Rearranging terms:
2xy = r - x² - x -1
So y = (r - x² -x -1) / (2x)

But since y has to be a positive integer, the numerator must be divisible by 2x, and the result must be a positive integer.

So for each possible x, we can compute whether (r -x² -x -1) is divisible by 2x, and if the result is positive.

Our task is to find the smallest x where this is possible.

But how do we find x? The key is to iterate over possible x values and check the conditions. But since r can be up to 1e12, iterating up to a large x isn't feasible unless we can find a bound on x.

We need to find the maximum possible x that could satisfy the equation. Let's think about the minimal possible value for y. Since y has to be at least 1, let's substitute y=1 into the equation and see what x would be. Then maybe find an upper bound for x.

Alternatively, let's consider the equation x² + 2xy +x +1 = r. Let's rearrange:

x² + x(2y +1) +1 = r.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, the expression for y is (r -x² -x -1)/(2x). For y to be positive, the numerator must be positive, so:

r -x² -x -1 > 0 → x² +x +1 < r → x² +x < r-1. So x must be less than sqrt(r-1) approximately. Because x² is the dominant term here.

So the maximum possible x we need to check is up to sqrt(r). But even sqrt(1e12) is 1e6, which is manageable. So iterating x from 1 up to sqrt(r) should be feasible.

Wait, but for each x, we can compute the required y, and check if it's a positive integer. Then, among all x that produce a valid y, pick the smallest x.

So the steps would be:

1. For x in 1 to possible_max_x:
   a. Calculate numerator = r - x² -x -1
   b. If numerator <=0: skip, because y must be positive.
   c. Check if numerator is divisible by 2x. If not, skip.
   d. If divisible, then y = numerator/(2x). Check if y is positive. Since numerator is positive (from a), then y is positive.
   e. So if all conditions met, record x and y. Since we're iterating x in increasing order, the first valid (x,y) we find is the answer with the smallest x.

But wait, what's the possible_max_x here? Let's think about the minimal x that could satisfy.

Alternatively, the maximum x is such that x² <= r, but even that's not tight. But let's compute possible_max_x as the square root of r. For example, x can't be larger than sqrt(r) because x² is part of H(x,y). For example, if x is larger than sqrt(r), then x² would be larger than r, but H(x,y) is x² plus other positive terms, which would be larger than r. So x can't exceed sqrt(r). Wait, but let's check.

Suppose x is larger than sqrt(r). Then x² > r. But H(x,y) is x² + ... which would be larger than r. So H(x,y) can't equal r. So x must be ≤ sqrt(r). So the maximum possible x is sqrt(r). So for r up to 1e12, sqrt(r) is 1e6, which is manageable. So iterating x from 1 to sqrt(r) is feasible.

So the algorithm is:

Loop x from 1 to sqrt(r), inclusive. For each x:

Calculate numerator = r - x^2 - x -1. If this is negative, skip.

Check if numerator is divisible by 2x. If yes, then y = numerator/(2x). If y is a positive integer, then return x and y.

If after all x are checked and none work, output NO.

But wait, even if x is up to sqrt(r), but for x in 1 to 1e6 (since sqrt(1e12) is 1e6), that's 1e6 iterations, which is acceptable.

Now, let's test with the sample inputs.

Sample 1: r=19.

x starts from 1.

x=1:

numerator = 19 -1 -1 -1 =16. 16/(2*1)=8 → y=8. Positive, so return (1,8). Which matches the sample.

Sample 2: r=16.

Check x from 1 to 4 (sqrt(16)=4).

x=1: 16-1-1-1=13. 13/(2*1) is 6.5 → not integer.

x=2: 16-4-2-1=9. 9/(4) = 2.25 → no.

x=3: 16-9-3-1=3. 3/(6)=0.5 → invalid (y must be positive integer).

x=4: 16-16-4-1= -5 → numerator negative. So no solution.

Thus output is NO.

So the algorithm works for samples.

Now, we need to implement this efficiently.

Edge cases:

What if r=1? Then x must be 1. But H(1,y) =1 + 2*1*y +1 +1 = 1+2y +2 =3+2y. So 3+2y=1 → 2y =-2 → y=-1. Not allowed. So output NO.

Another case: r= 3+2y. Let's see.

Wait, for example, r=5. Let's see:

x=1 → numerator=5-1-1-1=2. 2/(2) =1 → y=1. So (1,1) is solution. H(1,1)=1 + 2*1*1 +1 +1=1+2+2=5. So yes.

So algorithm would output (1,1).

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But wait, how to compute the upper limit for x?

The maximum x can be sqrt(r). But in code, we can calculate x_max as int(math.sqrt(r)) + 1. Because sometimes, for example, when r is a square, sqrt(r) is an integer, but adding 1 to cover cases where x is sqrt(r) +1 but in that case x^2 would be larger than r. So x_max is up to floor(sqrt(r)).

Wait, but for example, if r is 19, sqrt(19) is ~4.35. So x_max is 4. But in the first sample, x=1 is the correct solution, which is within the loop.

So in code, we can compute x_max as int(math.sqrt(r)), and loop x from 1 to x_max, inclusive.

But wait, let's check for x_max. Suppose r is 25 (5^2). Then x can be up to 5. Let's see: x=5. Then H(5,y)=5² + 2*5*y +5 +1 =25+10y+5+1=31+10y. If r=31+10y → possible. For example, if r=31, then y=0, which is invalid. But if r is 41, then 10y=10 → y=1. So for r=41, x=5 would be valid.

But when x is 5, sqrt(r) for r=41 is 6.4..., so x_max is 6. So x=5 is included. So yes, looping up to x_max=int(math.sqrt(r)) is correct.

Wait, sqrt(41) is about 6.4. int(math.sqrt(41)) is 6. So x can be up to 6. But x=5 is in the loop. So yes.

But for x=6, x²=36. Then numerator =41 -36-6-1= -2 → negative. So not valid. So x=6 is not considered. So the code will check x up to 6, but x=6's numerator is negative. So the code would skip.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, code steps:

1. Read r from input.

2. For x in 1 to int(math.sqrt(r)):

   a. Compute numerator = r - x² -x -1.

   b. If numerator <=0 → continue.

   c. Check if numerator is divisible by 2x.

   d. If divisible, compute y = numerator // (2x). Since numerator is divisible, it's integer.

   e. Check if y is >=1. If yes, return x and y.

3. After checking all x, if none found, output NO.

But wait, step 2a: numerator could be negative. So we have to check that.

Wait, for x in 1 to x_max (sqrt(r)):

x² is up to r. So x² + x +1 could be up to r + x_max +1. Which for x_max up to 1e6, but r up to 1e12, but in any case, the code checks for numerator being positive.

So the code's logic is correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

But what about very large r, like 1e12? The loop would run 1e6 times, which is manageable.

Now, let's code:

Import math.

Read r as integer.

Loop x from 1 to int(math.sqrt(r)):

Compute numerator = r - x*x -x -1.

If numerator <=0 → skip.

Check if numerator % (2*x) ==0 → if yes, then y = numerator // (2*x). If y is >=1, output x and y.

Once found, exit immediately.

Else, after all x, output NO.

Wait, but wait: when x is 1, the numerator could be (r -1 -1 -1) = r-3. For example, if r=3, then numerator is 0. Which is 0, but 0 divided by 2*1 is 0. So y=0. Which is invalid. So code would check if y >=1.

But for r=3, x=1's numerator is 0, which is not positive. So code skips.

Another example: r=5, x=1: numerator=5-1-1-1=2. 2/(2*1)=1. y=1. Valid.

So code would output 1 1.

Now, code:

But in Python, for x in range(1, x_max +1):

So:

import math

r = int(input())

found = False
for x in range(1, int(math.isqrt(r)) + 1):
    # Compute numerator
    numerator = r - x*x - x -1
    if numerator <=0:
        continue
    if numerator % (2 * x) ==0:
        y = numerator // (2 * x)
        if y >0:
            print(x, y)
            found = True
            break
if not found:
    print("NO")

Wait, in Python 3.8+, math.isqrt is available, which returns integer square root. So for r=19, isqrt(19) returns 4. So the loop is from 1 to 4 inclusive.

Which is correct.

Yes.

Testing sample input 19: x=1 is processed. So the code works.

Testing sample input 16: x loops up to 4. All x's numerators are checked. None work. So output is NO.

Now, edge cases:

Case where r=7.

Possible x:

x=1: numerator=7-1-1-1=4. 4/(2*1)=2 → y=2. So output is 1 2. Correct.

Another case: r=4. x can be up to 2.

x=1: numerator=4-1-1-1=1. 1/(2) → 0.5 → not integer.

x=2: 4-4-2-1= -3 → negative. So no solution. Output NO.

Another case: r= x^2 + 2x y +x +1.

Wait, what if x is the maximum possible? For example, x = sqrt(r) -1, but let's see.

But the code checks all possible x up to sqrt(r), so no problem.

So the code is correct.

But wait, what if x is such that x² +x +1 is larger than r? Then numerator is negative. So code skips.

Thus, the code works.

Now, time constraints: For r=1e12, x_max is 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 times. Each iteration is O(1) operations, which is manageable in 1 second. Python can handle 1e6 iterations in about 0.1 seconds or so.

Memory constraints: No issues here, since we are not storing any large data structures.

So this is the optimal approach. There's no better way than checking each possible x up to sqrt(r), since for each x we can compute y in O(1) time.

Alternative approaches: Perhaps find a mathematical way to represent possible x and y. But it's unclear. The current approach is O(sqrt(r)), which is acceptable for 1e12.
