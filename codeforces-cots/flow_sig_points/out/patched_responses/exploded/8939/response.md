<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to simplify a Unix-style file path by handling the '.' and '..' elements. Let's see how to approach this.

First, let me understand the problem. The input is a path that starts with a '/'. The elements are separated by '/' and can be directory names, '.', or '..'. My job is to process these elements and produce the shortest possible absolute path that represents the same location, without any '.' or '..'. But if there's an attempt to go above the root directory (like too many '..'s), I should return -1.

Hmm. The key here is to process each element and build a stack that represents the current directory structure. For each element:

- If it's '.', I ignore it.
- If it's '..', I pop the last directory from the stack, but only if the stack isn't empty. If it's empty, then it's invalid (since we can't go above root).
- Otherwise, it's a normal directory name, so push it onto the stack.

Wait, but the path starts with root, which is the initial directory. So the stack should start empty? Or wait, maybe the root is represented by the initial '/'. Hmm, maybe the initial stack starts with an empty string to represent the root? Or maybe the stack represents the directories under root. Let's think.

For example, the path "/a/b/../c" would become "/a/c". Processing each element:

Split the path into parts. The split would be ['', 'a', 'b', '..', 'c'] after splitting by '/'.

Processing each part except the first empty (since the path starts with '/').

So, the stack starts empty. Wait, perhaps the initial stack is empty. Then, when processing 'a', we push it. Then 'b' is pushed. Then '..' pops the last element, leaving 'a'. Then 'c' is pushed. So the stack is ['a', 'c'], and the resulting path is '/' followed by each element joined by '/', so '/a/c'.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Split the input path into parts using '/' as the delimiter. This will include empty strings where there are leading or trailing slashes, or consecutive slashes (though according to the problem statement, consecutive slashes aren't present). For example, the input path "/a/./b//c" isn't possible as per the input constraints since the problem says no two '/' are consecutive. Wait, the input constraints state that no two '/' are consecutive. So the split will have parts that are non-empty except for the first element (since the path starts with '/').

Wait, the input starts with '/', so when we split by '/', the first element is an empty string, followed by the parts. For example, "/a/b/.." split by '/' gives ['', 'a', 'b', '..'].

So the processing steps would be:

- Split the input into parts, skipping empty parts (but the problem says that consecutive '/' are not present, so empty parts can only be the first one? Or not. Let's see. The problem says: "No two '/' follow one after another". So when split by '/', there are no empty parts except possibly the first one (if the path starts with '/') and the last one (if the path ends with '/', but only allowed for the root). So for example, the input "/" will split into ['', ''] ?

Wait, let's think about splitting. The input path is given as per the problem statement. For example, the root is "/", which would split into ['', ''] when using split('/'), but according to the input constraints, "The only path which can end with "/" is the root directory path equal to "/"."

So perhaps when splitting, the parts are all the elements between slashes. For example, the input "/" is split into ['', '']? Or maybe when we split, the first empty string is the leading slash, and then any trailing empty string would be from a trailing slash.

But the problem says that the path starts with "/", so the first element in the split is empty. Then, each subsequent element is between slashes.

So, for processing, I can split the input path into parts using '/', then iterate over each part, skipping any empty strings (except for the initial empty string, which represents the root). Wait, but the split would result in parts like ['', 'a', 'b', '..'], etc. So the first element is the empty string (from the leading slash), then each element is a part between slashes.

But the problem states that no two slashes are consecutive, so the split parts (after splitting on '/') will not contain empty strings except for the first one (if the path starts with '/'), and possibly the last one if the path ends with '/' (only allowed for root). For example, the root path is "/", which splits into ['', ''].

Wait, in Python, the split function's behavior is that when you split on '/', for a string like "/", you get ['', ''] because splitting on '/' gives everything before and after. So for the input "/", the parts would be ['', ''].

So, the steps for processing:

- Split the input path into parts using '/' as the delimiter. This gives a list of parts.
- Iterate over each part except the first (empty string) and the last part if it's empty (only allowed in the case of the root path). Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the first element is empty (since the path starts with '/'), then the rest are the parts. For example, for the input "/a/../b", the split would be ['', 'a', '..', 'b'].

But for the input "/", the split is ['', ''].

So, the approach is to process all the parts except the first (empty) part, but also handle the case where the path is the root.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Split the path into parts using '/' as the delimiter, resulting in parts list.

Then, for each part in parts[1:], because parts[0] is empty (since the path starts with '/'), and parts[1:] are the elements between the slashes.

But for the root path, which is "/", parts would be ['', ''], so parts[1:] is [''].

Wait, in that case, for the root path, parts[1] is '', which is an empty part. But according to the problem statement, the only path that can end with '/' is the root. So the split result for "/" is ['', ''].

So, perhaps the code should process all parts except the first (parts[0] which is empty), and also ignore any empty parts (since consecutive slashes are not allowed, but the root path is a special case). Wait, but the problem says that the input does not have consecutive slashes, so all other parts (except possibly the first and last) are non-empty.

So, in the code, split the path into parts. Then, for each part in parts[1:], if the part is not empty, process it.

Wait, but in the root path, parts is ['', ''], so parts[1] is ''. So when we process parts[1:], we get [''], which is an empty string. But according to the problem, the only allowed path ending with '/' is the root. So perhaps when the original path is "/", the split is ['', ''] and the parts after split[0] is [''].

So, the processing steps would be:

Initialize a stack.

For each part in parts[1:]:

   if part is empty: continue (since this would only happen in the case of the root path ending with '/', which is allowed)

   else:

      process the part.

But perhaps in the code, after splitting, we can filter out empty parts except for the first one. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.

Wait, in the case of the root path "/", the parts are ['', ''], so parts[1:] is [''].

In this case, the code would process the empty string. But according to the problem statement, that's allowed only for the root path.

But for other paths, like "/a/", which ends with a '/', that's not allowed. So how do I handle that?

Wait, the problem says, "The only path which can end with "/" is the root directory path equal to "/". So if the input is something like "/a/", that's invalid. But according to the input constraints, the input is guaranteed to follow the rules. So the code does not need to validate the input. So the input is given in a correct format as per the problem statement.

So, in code:

Split the path into parts. Then, process each part in parts[1:], but skip any empty parts (since they can only occur at the end for the root path).

Wait, no. Because for example, the input "/a/b/c/" is not allowed (as per input constraints), so the code can assume that such cases are not present. So, in code, the parts after splitting will consist of parts[0] (empty), followed by non-empty parts, except when the entire path is "/", which splits into ['', ''].

So, when processing parts, the code can process all parts in parts[1:], even if they are empty (which only occurs in the case of the root path). So for the root path, parts[1:] is [''].

So, the code can do:

split_path = path.split('/')

for part in split_path[1:]:

   if part == '': 

       continue  # because in the root case, this is the only part

   else:

       process part.

Wait, but in the case of the root path, split_path is ['', ''], so split_path[1] is ''. So in the loop, we process this part. But part is empty. So in the code, how to handle this.

Wait, maybe the code should process all parts except the empty ones. Because in any other case except the root, the parts after splitting will have non-empty parts. For example, "/a/b" splits into ['', 'a', 'b'], so parts[1:] is ['a', 'b'], which are non-empty.

Only the root path has a split of ['', ''], and in that case, the code would process the empty part. So how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the code can process all parts, even empty ones. Let's see:

In the case of the root path, split_path is ['', '']. The code would process the first part (split_path[0] is empty), but according to the loop code above, it's split_path[1:], which is [''].

Wait, no. split_path[1:] in the root path is [''].

So, in the loop, part is ''. So, if the code checks for part in split_path[1:], which are parts after the initial empty.

Wait, but in the root case, after splitting, the code processes the [ ''] in split_path[1:].

So, in the code, for each part in split_path[1:]:

   if part is '.', '..', or a normal directory.

Wait, but in the root path, the part is empty string. So how to handle that.

Hmm. Maybe the code can first split the path into parts, then filter out any empty parts. Except that the root path would have to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can split into parts, then process all parts except the first (split_path[0], which is empty), and filter out empty strings. Except for the case where the entire path is "/".

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me think of some examples.

Example 1:

Input: /usr/share/mysql/../tomcat6/conf/server.xml

Split into ['', 'usr', 'share', 'mysql', '..', 'tomcat6', 'conf', 'server.xml']

Processing these parts (split_path[1:] is all parts after first empty string). These are non-empty.

Processing each part:

- 'usr' → add to stack → stack is ['usr']

- 'share' → add → ['usr', 'share']

- 'mysql' → add → ['usr', 'share', 'mysql']

- '..' → pop → ['usr', 'share']

- 'tomcat6' → add → ['usr', 'share', 'tomcat6']

- 'conf' → add → ['usr', 'share', 'tomcat6', 'conf']

- 'server.xml' → add → stack is ['usr', 'share', 'tomcat6', 'conf', 'server.xml']

Result is joining these elements with '/', preceded by '/', so '/usr/share/tomcat6/conf/server.xml'.

Which matches the sample output.

Another example:

Input: /a/./././..

Split into ['', 'a', '.', '.', '..', '..']

Processing split_path[1:]:

- 'a' → stack becomes ['a']

- '.' → ignore

- '.' → ignore

- '..' → pop → stack becomes empty

So after processing these parts, stack is empty. Then, the result is '/'.

But the next part is '..', but after stack is empty, popping would lead to error. Wait, no. Let's see the input is "/a/./././..".

Split into parts: ['', 'a', '.', '.', '..', '..'].

Processing each part in split_path[1:]:

- 'a' → push → stack is ['a']

- '.' → ignore

- '.' → ignore

- '..' → pop → stack is empty

- '..' → try to pop again, stack is empty → invalid, return -1.

Wait, but according to the sample input 2, the input is "/a/./././..", which outputs "/".

Wait, the sample input is "/a/./././..", and the output is "/".

So let's process that:

Split into parts: ['', 'a', '.', '.', '..', '..'].

Wait no, the original path is "/a/./././..", which when split by '/' gives ['', 'a', '.', '.', '..', '..']? Wait, no. Let's count:

Original input: "/a/./././.."

Split by '/' → the parts are:

The first character is '/', so split starts with empty string. Then between '/' and 'a' → 'a'. Then between '/' and '.' → '.', then another '.' (since there's a '/' between them), then another '.', then '..'.

Wait, the path is:

/a/./././..

So split by '/' gives ['', 'a', '.', '.', '.', '..'].

Ah right. So parts[1:] is ['a', '.', '.', '.', '..'].

Processing each:

- 'a' → stack is ['a']

- '.' → ignore.

- '.' → ignore.

- '.' → ignore.

- '..' → pop stack. Stack is empty.

So after processing all these parts, the stack is empty.

So the resulting path is '/' (since there are no elements in the stack, so the root directory). So output is '/'.

So in this case, even though there was a '..' that pops the stack to empty, it's allowed. Because you can't pop the root. Wait, but the root is represented by an empty stack? Because the code starts with an empty stack and pushes elements. So when the stack is empty, the path is '/'.

So in code:

After processing all parts, if the stack is empty, the output is '/'.

But if during processing a '..' is encountered and the stack is empty, then it's invalid. So how to handle that.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize a stack.

For each part in parts[1:]:

   if part is empty: skip (only possible in the case of the root path, which is allowed).

   elif part == '.': ignore.

   elif part == '..':

       if stack is not empty:

           pop the last element.

       else:

           return -1 (because you can't go above root)

   else:

       push part to stack.

Wait, but in the sample input 2, the code would process the '..' after stack becomes empty. Let's see:

Processing the path "/a/./././..":

Split into ['', 'a', '.', '.', '.', '..'].

So parts[1:] is ['a', '.', '.', '.', '..'].

Processing:

a → stack = [a]

. → ignore.

. → ignore.

. → ignore.

.. → pop a → stack is empty.

So after this, stack is empty. Then, the code proceeds. So no error. Then, the output is '/'.

But according to the algorithm above, when processing a '..', if the stack is empty, return -1. But in this case, the stack was not empty before the '..' was processed.

Wait, in this example, after 'a' is pushed, then the '..' is processed, which pops 'a', making stack empty. So that's allowed. Because the '..' refers to the parent directory of 'a', which is the root. So this is a valid operation.

So the algorithm is:

For each '..' encountered, if the stack is not empty, pop. Otherwise, return -1.

So, in the case where processing a '..' when the stack is empty (like the path '/..'), that's invalid. But in the case where during processing, a '..' is encountered and the stack is not empty, then pop.

So in the sample input 2, the '..' is processed when the stack has elements, so it's allowed. So the code would not return -1.

Therefore, the algorithm needs to process all parts, and during the processing, if any '..' is encountered when the stack is empty, it's invalid, and return -1.

So the steps are:

1. Split the input into parts.

2. Iterate over each part in parts[1:] (since parts[0] is empty, due to leading '/').

3. For each part:

   a. if part is empty, skip (this can only happen in the root case, where the path ends with '/').

   b. if part is '.', do nothing.

   c. if part is '..':

       i. if stack is not empty, pop.

       ii. else, return -1.

   d. else, push part to stack.

But wait, in the case where the input path is "/..", the split is ['', '..'], so parts[1:] is ['..'].

Processing this part:

It's '..', stack is empty. So return -1.

Another example: input is "/a/../.." → split into ['', 'a', '..', '..'].

Processing:

- 'a' pushed → stack is [a]

- '..' → pop → stack empty.

- next '..' → stack is empty → return -1.

So in that case, output is -1.

So the algorithm is correct.

Now, how to handle the case where the input is the root path.

For example, input is "/", split into ['', ''].

parts[1:] is ['']. So the code processes this part.

But part is empty. So in step a, skip. So nothing is done. So the stack remains empty. Then, the code proceeds to build the result. Since the stack is empty, the result is '/'.

Another example: input is "/a//b". Wait, no, the problem says consecutive '/' are not present. So code can assume that all parts after split are non-empty except for the first (empty) and possibly the last (only if it's the root). So code doesn't need to handle that.

So, after processing all parts, the code constructs the path by joining the elements in the stack with '/', and adding a leading '/'.

But if the stack is empty, the path is '/'.

So code steps:

- Process all parts as per the algorithm. If at any point a '..' is processed when the stack is empty, return -1.

- After processing all parts, construct the path.

   If the stack is empty: output '/'.

   Else: output '/' + '/'.join(stack).

So, the code will need to implement this.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, read the input line. Then, split into parts.

Then, process each part in parts[1:].

But in the case of the root path, parts[1:] may include an empty string (from split). For example, the input is "/", split into ['', ''] → parts[1:] is [''].

So, in code:

path = input().strip()

parts = path.split('/')

stack = []

for part in parts[1:]:  # parts[0] is empty, since path starts with '/'

    if not part:

        continue  # skip empty parts (which can only happen if the path ends with '/', which is allowed only for root)

    if part == '.':

        continue

    elif part == '..':

        if stack:

            stack.pop()

        else:

            # Attempting to go above root, invalid

            print(-1)

            exit()

    else:

        stack.append(part)

# After processing all parts, build the result

if not stack:

    print('/')

else:

    print('/' + '/'.join(stack))

Wait, but let's test sample input 2.

Sample input 2 is "/a/./././.."

Split into parts: ['', 'a', '.', '.', '.', '..']

Processing parts[1:] → 'a', '.', '.', '.', '..'.

Processing 'a' → stack becomes ['a'].

Then three '.' are skipped.

Then '..' → pop 'a' → stack is empty.

No other parts. So stack is empty. So output is '/'.

Which is correct.

Another sample: input "/a/../.." → parts[1:] is 'a', '..', '..'.

Processing 'a' → stack [a].

Then '..' → pop → stack empty.

Then '..' → stack is empty → return -1.

So code prints -1.

Another case: input "/.." → parts[1:] is ['..'] → processing '..' when stack is empty → return -1.

So code is correct.

What about input like "/home/../../.."?

Processing:

parts[1:] is ['home', '..', '..', '..'].

Processing 'home' → stack ['home'].

Then '..' → stack empty.

Next '..' → stack is empty → error. So return -1.

Yes.

What about input "/...", where the part is '...' (which is not '.' or '..') → code appends to stack. So output is '/...'.

Which is correct.

Another test case: input "/a/.../b" → output is '/a/.../b'.

So code handles parts that are not '.' or '..'.

So code seems correct.

But wait, the problem says: "Each element different from specials "." and ".." contains at least one character different from the dots." So parts like '...' are allowed as they have other characters (but wait, the problem says: "Any element different from specials "." and ".." contains at least one character different from the dots."

Wait, the problem statement says:

"Each element may contain "a"-"z", "0"-"9" and dots. Any element different from specials "." and ".." contains at least one character different from the dots."

So, for example, an element like "..." is allowed if it's not '.' or '..', but it's made up of dots. But according to the problem statement, such elements are invalid. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that any element that's not '.' or '..' must contain at least one character that is not a dot.

So, if an element is '...', it's not a special element (since it's three dots), but it's made up of only dots. So according to the input constraints, this is invalid. However, the input is guaranteed to be correct. So the code does not need to check this. Because the problem says: "the given path" follows the constraints.

So the code can process all parts normally, because the input is valid.

Thus, the code is correct.

But wait, the problem says, "You task is to convert the given path to such a path, which doesn't contain special elements '.' and/or '..'. If it is impossible, print "-1". The only reason for it is an attempt to move to the parent directory from the root."

So the code does not need to validate the input. The input is correct as per the problem's input constraints. So the code can proceed as described.

Therefore, the code above should work.

Now, let's test the code against the samples.

Sample 1:

Input: /usr/share/mysql/../tomcat6/conf/server.xml

Split into parts:

['', 'usr', 'share', 'mysql', '..', 'tomcat6', 'conf', 'server.xml']

Processing parts[1:]:

'usr' → stack ['usr']

'share' → stack ['usr', 'share']

'mysql' → stack ['usr', 'share', 'mysql']

'..' → pop to ['usr', 'share']

'tomcat6' → append → ['usr', 'share', 'tomcat6']

'conf' → append → ['usr', 'share', 'tomcat6', 'conf']

'server.xml' → append → stack has those elements.

Output is '/' + 'usr/share/tomcat6/conf/server.xml', which is correct.

Sample 2:

Input: /a/./././..

Split into parts: ['', 'a', '.', '.', '.', '..'].

Processing parts[1:]:

'a' → stack ['a']

three '.' → skipped.

'..' → stack becomes empty.

Stack is empty → output is '/'.

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: input is "/a/..".

Split into ['', 'a', '..'].

Processing 'a' → stack ['a'], then '..' → pop → stack empty. Output is '/'.

Another test case: input "/.." → returns -1.

Yes.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

```python
path = input().strip()
parts = path.split('/')
stack = []

        continue
