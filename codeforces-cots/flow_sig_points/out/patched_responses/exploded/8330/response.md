Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of possible integers formed by replacing the underscores and Xs in the given string such that the resulting number is divisible by 25 and doesn't have leading zeros. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The input string can have digits, underscores, and Xs. The Xs must all be replaced by the same digit. The underscores can be replaced by any digit. The resulting number must be divisible by 25 and not have leading zeros. Oh right, leading zeros are a problem unless the number is exactly zero. Wait, but according to the note, 0 has no leading zero, but 0000 has three. So the entire number can't be zero with leading zeros. Wait, no. The exception is the integer zero. So if the number is 0, then it's allowed, but if it's like 00, that's considered as two leading zeros. So the number can't start with a zero unless it's a single zero. Or maybe more accurately, the number can't have any leading zeros unless the entire number is zero. Wait, the note says "a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit". So, for example, 0 is allowed (no leading zeros), but 0000 is not allowed because it has three leading zeros. So the rule is: the number cannot have any leading zeros. So the first character (if there are multiple digits) can't be zero. Unless the entire number is zero. Wait, but if the input is "0", then the output is 1. If the input is "00", then that's two digits. So, "00" would be invalid because leading zero. So in the case of a multi-digit number, the first digit can't be zero. But if the entire number is a single zero, it's allowed.

So the problem is to count all possible replacements of Xs (same digit) and underscores (any digits) such that the resulting number is divisible by 25, and doesn't have leading zeros.

So the approach here is to generate all possible candidates for the last two digits. Because a number is divisible by 25 if and only if its last two digits are one of 00, 25, 50, 75. So the key is to check for each of these possible endings, and then count how many ways the rest of the digits can be filled in without leading zeros.

So the plan is:

1. Enumerate all possible endings (the last two digits must form 00, 25, 50, 75).
   - Wait, but for numbers with only one digit, like "0", which is allowed. But in that case, the number must be 0. So for single-digit cases, only 0 is allowed, but according to the problem statement, the input's length is at least 1. So if the input is a single character, like 'X', then we need to check if replacing X with 0 is allowed (but leading zero is allowed only if the entire number is 0). So maybe in the general case, the approach is to first check for numbers that are exactly zero. But that's a special case.

Wait, perhaps the general approach is to consider numbers with length >=1. So for the problem:

- The number can't have leading zeros. So for a number with length n>1, the first digit can't be zero. For n=1, it can be zero.

But let's see. For example, input "0" gives output 1. Input "0_25" gives 0 because even though the number could be 0025 (but that's leading zero). So the problem is to avoid leading zeros except when the entire number is a single zero.

So the steps I need to take are:

For each possible candidate ending (the last two digits must form a valid pair for divisibility by 25), but considering the entire number:

- If the number has length 1, then the only possible is 0, 5. Wait, 0 is divisible by 25. But 5 is not. Wait, 5 is not divisible by 25. So for a single-digit number, only 0 is valid.

Wait, 25 divides the number if the number is 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, etc. So for a single-digit number, only 0 is possible. Because 0 is divisible by 25. So for single-digit input, the only valid case is when the entire number is 0.

So, the approach should handle two cases:

1. The number has length 1: only 0 is valid. So check if the input can be replaced to 0.

2. The number has length >=2: Check each of the possible endings (00, 25, 50, 75), and for each, see if the last two digits can be set to that pair. Then, check the rest of the digits (from the third digit from the end onwards) can be filled such that there are no leading zeros.

But how to model the Xs and underscores?

Let's think.

Each X in the string must be replaced by the same digit. So, for example, if the input is 'XX', the two Xs must be replaced by the same digit. But in the case where the ending is 00 (like the third example), Xs could be replaced by 0, leading to 00 as the last two digits.

So the plan is:

For each possible ending (00, 25, 50, 75), and for numbers with length >=2:

   For each possible pair (a, b) where the last two digits are a and b (forming 00, 25, 50, 75):

       Check if the last two characters in the input can be replaced to a and b, considering X and _.

       Also, for Xs in the entire string (not just the last two), all Xs must be replaced by the same digit. So Xs in the string can be in any positions, and all must be the same. So for example, if the input is X_X, then all Xs (the first and third) must be the same digit, and the underscores can be any digit.

Wait, this complicates things. So all Xs must be replaced by the same digit. So when replacing Xs, they all must be the same. So, in the entire string, X's are replaced by the same digit (could be 0-9). So this is a variable that affects the entire string.

So the problem is to find all possible combinations of X value (0-9), and replacements for underscores (each can be 0-9), such that:

- The entire string forms a number divisible by 25.

- The number has no leading zeros (unless it's exactly one zero).

So the approach must consider the X's value as a single variable (same for all Xs in the string), and the underscores as variables that can be anything.

But how to model this in code?

An alternative approach is:

Loop over all possible X values (0-9). For each X value:

   Replace all Xs in the string with this value.

   Then, for this modified string (which may contain X's replaced and underscores), check if it's possible to replace the underscores with digits (0-9) such that the resulting number is divisible by 25 and has no leading zeros.

   Sum all the possibilities across all X values.

But this is O(10 * ... ), which is manageable given the small input size (max 8 characters).

Wait, but for each X value, the string becomes a combination of fixed digits (from Xs) and underscores. Then, the problem becomes how many ways to replace the underscores to make the entire number valid.

But even then, for each X, the problem is similar to the case where X is fixed. So for each X, we need to compute the possibilities for the underscores, given that X is fixed to a certain value, and then sum over all possible X values (if any Xs are present).

Wait, but if the input has no Xs, then X's value is irrelevant. So in that case, the X loop runs once (but maybe the code can check if there are Xs in the input, and if not, loop over X once with a dummy value, or adjust the code accordingly).

So here's the plan:

1. Enumerate all possible X values (0-9). But if there are no Xs in the input, then X can be any value (but since they don't affect the string, the code can just process once, as all Xs' values are irrelevant when there are no Xs).

Wait, no. If the input has no Xs, then the Xs' possible values don't matter. So for such inputs, the loop over X can run once (since X has no impact). So the code can check if there are Xs. If yes, loop over 0-9. Otherwise, loop once (but the X value is not used).

So for the code:

count = 0

for x_val in possible_x_values:

   temp_s = original string with X replaced by x_val.

   then, compute how many ways to replace the underscores in temp_s to form a valid number (divisible by 25 and no leading zeros).

   add that to the count.

So the key is, for each x_val, generate the template string (with X replaced by x_val, underscores remain as underscores), then compute the number of valid ways to replace the underscores in this template string.

So, now, the problem reduces to, for a string with digits and underscores, how many ways to replace the underscores to make the number divisible by 25 and no leading zeros.

But how to compute that?

Well, for each x_val, and the resulting string after replacing Xs, we need to check if the number (after replacing underscores) is divisible by 25 and has no leading zeros.

So the steps for each x_val:

a. Replace all Xs in the original string with x_val. Let's call this s_prime.

b. For s_prime, process it to count the number of valid replacements of underscores.

But how?

So s_prime now consists of digits (from X replaced) and underscores. The underscores can be replaced by any digit (0-9). The resulting number must:

- Be divisible by 25.

- Have no leading zeros (unless the entire number is 0).

So, the approach for step b is:

Check if the number can have its last two digits as one of 00, 25, 50, 75. Or, for numbers with length 1, it must be 0.

So again, split into two cases:

Case 1: length of s_prime is 1.

   The number must be 0. So check if s_prime is '_', which can be replaced with 0. Or if it's already 0 (and no underscores). Then, the count is 1 if possible, else 0.

Case 2: length >=2.

   The last two digits must form a pair in {00, 25, 50, 75}. So for each possible pair in this set, check if it's possible to set the last two characters of s_prime to this pair (taking into account that some positions may already be digits or underscores), and then check the rest of the digits (from the third last onwards) can be filled such that the first digit is not zero.

Wait, but for the last two digits, how do they get set? Because in s_prime, some positions may be underscores, which can be replaced with any digit. But for the last two digits to form a valid pair (like 25), the two characters in s_prime (after X replacement) must be compatible with that pair.

For example, if s_prime is '2_', and the pair is 25, then the second character (originally '_') can be replaced by 5. The first character is 2, which is fixed (since in s_prime, after replacing Xs, that's a digit). So for the pair 25, the last two characters of s_prime must be such that the first can be the first digit of the pair, and the second can be the second digit of the pair. Wait, no. Wait, the last two digits of the final number must be the pair, but the s_prime (after X replacement) may have some fixed digits (from X or original digits) in the last two positions. So, for each possible pair (like 25), we need to check if the last two positions in s_prime can be set to 2 and 5, considering that some positions are fixed digits (from X replacement or original digits) and others are underscores (which can be replaced).

So for each possible pair (a, b), check if:

the last two characters of s_prime (after X replacement) can be set to a and b. For each position in the last two:

   if the character is a digit (from X replacement or original), it must equal the required a or b.

   if the character is an underscore, it can be set to the required a or b (so no conflict).

If this is possible, then for the rest of the digits (positions 0 to n-3), we need to ensure that they can be filled in such a way that the first digit is not zero (unless the entire number is zero, which can't happen for length >=2 except when all digits are zero, but that's only allowed if the number is 0, which has length 1. So for length >=2, the first digit cannot be zero).

Wait, but for example, the input is "000" (length 3). Then, the number would be 000, which is leading zeros. So it's invalid. So for a number with length >=2, the first digit can't be zero, unless the entire number is a single zero. But when the length is >=2, that's not possible.

So, for the general case (length >=2), the first digit must be non-zero.

So, for the rest of the digits (positions 0 to n-3), the first digit (position 0) can't be zero, and the other digits (positions 1 to n-3) can be anything (including zeros).

So, the algorithm for case 2 (length >=2) is:

for each possible pair (a, b) in {00, 25, 50, 75}:

   check if the last two characters of s_prime can be set to a and b. This means:

      for the (n-2)th character (second to last) in s_prime:

          if it's a digit, it must be equal to a.

          if it's an underscore, it can be set to a.

      similarly, for the (n-1)th character (last):

          if it's a digit, it must be equal to b.

          if it's an underscore, it can be set to b.

   if this is possible, then:

       count the number of ways to fill the remaining underscores (positions 0 to n-3) such that the first digit (position 0) is not zero.

       multiply this by 1 (since the last two are fixed to a and b) and add to the total.

But how to compute the number of possibilities for the remaining underscores?

So, for the remaining digits (excluding the last two):

   the first digit (position 0) must not be zero.

   the other digits (positions 1 to n-3) can be any digits (0-9) where there was an underscore.

So:

- Check if the first digit (position 0) is already a digit (from X replacement or original). If it's a digit, then:

   if it's zero, this case is invalid (since the first digit can't be zero for length >=2).

   else, it's valid, and the number of possibilities for the remaining underscores (if any) is 10^k, where k is the number of underscores in the remaining positions (excluding first digit if it's fixed).

But if the first digit is an underscore (i.e., can be replaced), then:

   it must be replaced by 1-9 (to avoid leading zero). So that's 9 options.

   the other underscores in the remaining positions can be any digit (including zero). So each has 10 options.

So the number of possibilities for the remaining underscores is:

   (number of possibilities for first digit) * (product of 10^d for each underscore in the remaining positions except first digit)

So, let's break it down:

remaining_underscores = the number of underscores in positions 0 to n-3.

But the first digit (position 0) may be a fixed digit, an underscore, or part of the remaining positions.

Wait, the first digit is position 0. So for the remaining digits (positions 0 to n-3, which is the first digit and the digits before the last two), we need to check:

If the first digit is part of these remaining digits.

Yes, because n is the total length. For example, if the original string is of length 5, the last two positions are 3 and 4 (0-based). The remaining positions are 0, 1, 2.

So the first digit is part of the remaining positions.

So, for the remaining positions (0 to n-3):

Check each character:

For position 0 (the first digit of the entire number):

   if it's a digit:

       if it's zero, then this entire option is invalid (since the first digit can't be zero for a number with length >=2). So the pair (a, b) is not valid in this case.

       else, proceed, and the first digit is fixed. The underscores in other remaining positions can be anything (each contributes 10^d).

   if it's an underscore:

       then it can be replaced by 1-9 (9 options). The remaining underscores in positions 1 to n-3 (if any) contribute 10^d each.

   else (other digits, but that's already handled).

So, for the remaining positions (excluding the last two):

We need to check if all the fixed digits (non-underscore) in those positions are compatible with the leading zero rule, and compute the number of possibilities for the underscores.

So, let's formalize this:

Let's process the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

Check if the first character (position 0) is a digit:

   if it's 0: invalid, skip this pair.

   else (non-zero digit): check if any of the other remaining positions (positions 1 to n-3) have fixed digits (non-underscore) that can't be changed.

   Then, the number of possibilities is 1 (since all digits are fixed except underscores) multiplied by 10^ (number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

If the first character is an underscore:

   then it can be replaced by 1-9 (9 options). Then, the other underscores in positions 1 to n-3 can be replaced by any digit (0-9). So the number of possibilities is 9 * 10^(number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

If the first character is not a digit and not an underscore (but this can't happen, because after replacing Xs, s_prime contains digits and underscores only. So in s_prime, all Xs are replaced by x_val, so the s_prime can have digits, underscores. So the remaining positions in s_prime can be digits (from Xs replaced) or underscores.

Wait, yes. Because after X replacement, the s_prime consists of digits and underscores. So in the remaining positions (excluding the last two), each character is either a digit (from X or original) or an underscore.

So, for the remaining positions, for each character:

   if it's a digit: must be the same as the required value. But in the remaining positions, the required value is whatever the replacement of underscores allows. Wait, no: the remaining positions can be filled with any digits (as long as the first digit is non-zero). So the digits in the remaining positions (except the first digit) can be any value as long as their original character (after X replacement) allows it.

Wait, no. The remaining positions (positions 0 to n-3) can have digits (from X replacement) or underscores.

So for each position in the remaining part (excluding last two):

   if it's a digit (from X replacement or original), then in the final number, it must be that digit.

   if it's an underscore, can be any digit (0-9), but for the first position, it can't be zero (if it's an underscore).

So, for example:

If the remaining part is 'A23_', where A is position 0 (the first digit), and it's an underscore. Then, A must be replaced with 1-9. The underscore in position 3 can be replaced with 0-9.

So the approach is:

For the remaining part:

1. Check if position 0 is a digit. If it is:

   a. If it's zero: invalid.

   b. Else: proceed. Then, check all other positions in the remaining part. For each of those positions:

      if it's a digit (fixed), nothing to do.

      if it's an underscore: multiply by 10 (since it can be any digit).

   So the number of possibilities here is 1 (for the fixed digits) multiplied by 10^ (number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

2. If position 0 is an underscore:

   a. Then, it can be replaced by 1-9 (9 options).

   b. For the rest of the remaining positions (positions 1 to n-3):

      each underscore contributes a factor of 10.

   So the number of possibilities is 9 * 10^ (number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

3. If position 0 is a non-zero digit, and other positions in the remaining part have fixed digits (including underscores that are not part of the first position), then multiply accordingly.

But also, we need to check that in the remaining positions (positions 0 to n-3), any existing digits (from X replacement or original) are valid, i.e., they are fixed and don't conflict with the leading zero rule.

So for example, in the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

If position 0 is a digit and is zero, then this case is invalid. Otherwise, it's okay.

So, putting this together:

For each possible pair (a, b) in {00, 25, 50, 75}:

   check if the last two characters can be set to a and b. If not, skip.

   then, check the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

      check if the first character (position 0) is a digit:

         if it's zero: invalid.

         else: valid. Then, count the number of underscores in the remaining positions (positions 0 to n-3), but:

             if the first character is a digit, then the underscores in the remaining part (positions 1 to n-3) can be any digit.

             the number of possibilities is 10^(number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

      else (first character is an underscore):

         count the number of underscores in the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3). For position 0, it's 9 options. For positions 1 to n-3, each is 10 options.

         the number of possibilities is 9 * 10^(number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

      but also, for the remaining positions (other than position 0):

         if any of the characters is a digit (from X replacement) that is fixed, but in the remaining positions, that's allowed. Because the remaining positions can be any digits as long as their characters (after X replacement) are either digits (fixed) or underscores (can be replaced). So as long as the pair (a, b) is possible, the rest of the characters (other than the first digit) can be any digits, but their characters must be compatible. Wait, no. The remaining characters (positions 0 to n-3) are part of the s_prime (after X replacement). So they can be either digits (fixed) or underscores. So when we replace the underscores, the digits are fixed, and underscores can be replaced with any digits. But for the remaining positions (other than the last two), their digits are fixed unless they are underscores.

Wait, yes. So the remaining positions (0 to n-3) in s_prime can be:

- digits (from X replacement or original) that are fixed, or

- underscores, which can be replaced by any digit (but for position 0, if it's an underscore, it must be replaced by 1-9).

So, in the remaining part, the number of possibilities is:

if the first character is a digit:

   if it's zero: invalid.

   else:

      the number of underscores in positions 0 to n-3 (excluding the first digit?) No.

Wait, the first character is position 0. So the remaining part is positions 0,1,...,n-3.

So, for example, if s_prime after X replacement is 'A12_', and the last two digits are fixed to 00. Then, the remaining part is 'A1'.

In this case, the first character is 'A' (position 0), which in s_prime could be a digit or underscore.

So the steps for the remaining part:

Check if the first character is a digit:

   if it's zero: invalid.

   else: valid. Then, the number of possibilities is 10^k, where k is the number of underscores in the remaining positions (excluding the first digit? Or including?)

No, the first character is a digit (non-zero). Then, all underscores in the remaining positions (positions 0 to n-3) can be filled. Wait, no:

The remaining positions (0 to n-3) include the first character. But in this scenario, the first character is a digit (non-zero). So the underscores in the remaining positions are in positions 0 to n-3. Wait, but position 0 is a digit here, so it's fixed. So the underscores are in positions 1 to n-3.

So the count is 10^ (number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3).

If the first character is an underscore (position 0), then it can be filled with 1-9 (9 options), and the other underscores in positions 1 to n-3 can be filled with any digits (10 options each).

So the code needs to:

For each possible pair (a, b):

   check if the last two characters can be a and b.

   if yes:

      check the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

         check first character (position 0):

            if it's a digit:

               if it's 0: skip (invalid leading zero)

               else: compute the number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3. The possibilities are 10^underscore_count.

            else (it's an underscore):

               compute the number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3. The possibilities are 9 * 10^underscore_count.

            but also, check if any of the other digits (positions 1 to n-3) are fixed digits. Because those positions are part of s_prime and must be fixed if they are digits.

            Wait, no. For example, in the remaining positions (positions 0 to n-3), if any position (other than 0) is a digit (from X replacement), that's fixed and must be part of the number. But since the pair (a, b) is already valid, the code can proceed. But the other digits in the remaining positions are allowed to be any digits (since the only requirement is divisibility by 25 and no leading zero). So for the remaining positions (other than the last two), their digits are fixed (if they are digits in s_prime), or can be any digits (if they are underscores).

But the code doesn't need to check them for any condition except the leading zero.

So the code can proceed as follows:

For the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

   Check if the first character is a digit:

      if it's 0: invalid.

      else: the rest of the underscores (positions 1 to n-3) can be replaced, each with 10 options.

   else (first is underscore):

      9 options for first character, and the rest (positions 1 to n-3) can be replaced with any digits (each 10 options).

But also, we need to count the number of underscores in the remaining part.

Wait, but in the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3), some characters may be digits (fixed) and others underscores (replaceable). So for the count, the number of underscores in the remaining part is:

count_underscores = number of underscores in positions 0 to n-3.

But for the first character (position 0):

   if it's a digit: then it's not an underscore. So the underscores are in the other positions.

   if it's an underscore: then count_underscores includes position 0.

Wait, no. For the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

the code can process each character:

sum the number of underscores in these positions.

Then:

if the first character is a digit (non-zero):

   the underscores are in positions 0 to n-3 (but position 0 is a digit, so not part of underscores). So the count is sum of underscores in positions 0 to n-3, excluding position 0 (if it's a digit). Wait, no. If the first character is a digit, then in the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3), position 0 is a digit (not an underscore). So the underscores are in the other positions (positions 1 to n-3). So the count is the number of underscores in positions 1 to n-3.

But how to compute that?

Alternative approach:

For the remaining part (positions 0 to n-3):

   collect all characters in these positions.

   first_char = remaining_part[0] (position 0)

   if first_char is a digit:

      if first_char is '0': invalid.

      else:

          count_underscores = sum(1 for c in remaining_part[1:] if c == '_')

          possibilities = 10 ** count_underscores

   else:  # first_char is '_'

      count_underscores = sum(1 for c in remaining_part[1:] if c == '_')

      possibilities = 9 * (10 ** count_underscores)

But also, the remaining_part may have other characters (digits) in positions 1 to n-3. For example, if position 1 is a '5' (fixed digit), then it's allowed. So the code doesn't need to check those digits (as long as the pair (a, b) is valid and the first digit is not zero).

So the code can proceed as follows for the remaining part:

If the first character is a digit and is zero: invalid.

Else:

   compute the number of underscores in the remaining_part (excluding the first character if it's a digit, but including if it's an underscore?).

Wait, in the remaining_part, the first character is position 0.

If it's a digit (non-zero), then the underscores in the remaining_part are positions 1 to n-3. So count_underscores = sum(c == '_' for c in remaining_part[1:])

If it's an underscore, then the underscores in remaining_part include the first character. But in that case, the first character is replaced by 1-9, and the other underscores (positions 1 to n-3) are replaced by any digits. So the count_underscores for this case is sum(c == '_' for c in remaining_part[1:]).

So the code can first split the remaining_part into first_char and the rest.

So, code steps for remaining_part:

remaining_part = s_prime[: len(s_prime)-2]  # positions 0 to n-3

if not remaining_part:  # len(s_prime) is 2, so remaining_part is empty.

   # So the entire number is a two-digit number. So the first digit is the first character of the pair (a, b). But wait, no. For example, if the pair is 00, then the first digit is 0. Which is invalid. So in this case, len(s_prime) is 2. So the remaining_part is empty. So the code needs to handle this.

Wait, in the case where len(s_prime) is 2, then after fixing the last two digits (which are the entire string), the remaining_part is empty. So the code needs to check if the first character of the pair (a) is zero. Because the entire number is two digits, and the first digit is a (the first of the pair). So for example, pair 00: the first digit is 0, which is invalid (since length is 2). So this case would be invalid.

So in the case where the remaining_part is empty (len(s_prime) is 2), then the code must ensure that the first digit (a) is not zero.

So in this case, the code would check if a is zero. If yes, then this pair is invalid.

So the code must handle this case.

But how to integrate this into the code.

So, the code can proceed as follows for each pair (a, b):

   if len(s_prime) >=2:

      check if the last two characters can be set to a and b.

      if not, skip.

      then, check if the remaining_part (positions 0 to n-3) is empty (i.e., len(s_prime) == 2). In this case:

          the first digit of the entire number is a (since the entire number is the pair a, b). So if a is zero, then the entire number starts with zero (invalid for length 2). So this pair is invalid unless a is non-zero.

          So for the pair (a, b), if len(s_prime) == 2:

              if a == 0: invalid.

              else: the possibilities is 1 (since no underscores in remaining_part) multiplied by the possible underscores in the pair (which were already checked in the initial step of the pair).

Wait, but the pair (a, b) is part of the s_prime's last two digits. So when len(s_prime) is 2, the last two digits are the entire string. So for example, if the s_prime is 'XX', and x_val is 5. Then, the pair (5,0) would set the entire string to 50, which is allowed (since first digit is 5, not zero). So in this case, the code would proceed.

But if the pair is 00 (len(s_prime) is 2), then the entire number is 00, which is invalid (leading zero). So for len(s_prime) ==2, the code must check that the first digit of the pair (a) is not zero.

So the code should:

if len(s_prime) == 2:

   if a == '0':  # first digit is zero, invalid.

       continue.

   else:

       check if the pair can be set to a and b. If yes, then the possibilities is 1 (since there are no underscores in the remaining_part, which is empty). But wait, the code may have underscores in the last two positions.

Wait, no. The code first checks if the last two can be set to a and b. So in the case where len(s_prime) is 2, the code will check whether the two characters in s_prime can be set to a and b. For example, if s_prime is '_X', and x_val is 5, then s_prime becomes '_5'. For pair 25, the first character (position 0) is '_' (can be set to 2), and the second (position 1) is 5 (must be 5, which matches b). So the pair is possible.

Then, after checking that, the code checks if a is zero. Because the entire number is two digits, and the first digit is a. So in that case, if a is zero, the number is invalid.

So, in code:

for pair in pairs:

   if len(s) >=2:

      check if last two can be pair.

      if yes:

          if len(s) == 2:

              if a != '0':

                  possibilities += 1 (assuming no underscores in the remaining part, which is empty)

              else:

                  continue

          else:

              process the remaining part.

But how?

Alternatively, for len(s_prime) ==2, the remaining_part is empty. So the code can treat it as:

remaining_part = empty.

So:

if remaining_part is empty:

   the first digit is a (the first character of the pair). So if a is zero: invalid. else: valid.

So the code can handle this case separately.

So integrating all this, the code can:

for each x_val in possible_x_values:

   s_prime = original string with X replaced by x_val.

   if len(s_prime) ==1:

      if s_prime is '_' or 'X' (but X is replaced by x_val). Wait, no, s_prime after X replacement consists of digits and underscores. So s_prime for len 1 can be a digit (like '5') or '_'.

      For len 1, the number must be 0 to be divisible by 25.

      So check if s_prime can be replaced to 0.

      s_prime can be:

          if it's '_': can replace to 0. So count 1.

          if it's a digit: must be 0. Else, not.

          So, for s_prime in len 1:

              count = 0

              if s_prime has any underscores:

                  if s_prime has exactly one '_', then it can be replaced with 0. So count +=1.

              else:

                  if s_prime == '0': count +=1.

              So, for len 1, after replacing Xs, check if the resulting s_prime can be 0.

   else:

      for each pair (a, b) in {'00', '25', '50', '75'}:

          check if last two can be set to a and b.

          if not, continue.

          then:

              check if len(s_prime) ==2:

                  if a == '0':  # first digit of pair is 0, but len is 2. So leading zero. invalid.

                      continue.

                  else:

                      check if the remaining_part (empty) can be filled:

                          the remaining_part has no underscores. So possibilities =1.

              else:

                  process the remaining_part (positions 0 to n-3):

                      first_char = remaining_part[0] if remaining_part else None

                      if remaining_part:

                          first_char = remaining_part[0]

                          if first_char is a digit:

                              if first_char == '0':

                                  continue  # invalid leading zero.

                              else:

                                  underscores_in_rest = sum(1 for c in remaining_part[1:] if c == '_')

                                  possibilities_rest = 10 ** underscores_in_rest

                          else:  # first_char is '_'

                              underscores_in_rest = sum(1 for c in remaining_part[1:] if c == '_')

                              possibilities_rest = 9 * (10 ** underscores_in_rest)

                      else:  # len(s_prime) ==2, handled earlier.

                          pass

              then, multiply possibilities_rest by the possible ways for the pair (a, b) and add to the count.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of an example.

Example 3 input: _XX → output 9.

Input is '_XX'. So possible X values are 0-9.

For each X_val, replace X's with X_val. So the s_prime becomes '_XX' → '_vv' where v is X_val.

Then, the code would process each X_val and check for each pair (00, 25, 50, 75) whether the last two digits can be set to the pair.

The last two digits are X_val and X_val (since the input is '_XX', after X replacement, it's '_vv').

So for example, if X_val is 0, then the last two digits are 00. The s_prime is '_00'. Then, check if the last two can be set to 00 (yes). Then, the remaining_part is '_'. So first_char is '_', which is the first digit of the entire number (since the remaining_part is length 1). So the first_char must be replaced with 1-9 (9 options). The rest of the underscores in remaining_part (none, since remaining_part is length 1) is 0. So possibilities_rest is 9 * 10^0 =9. Multiply by 1 (since the pair is 00, and the last two digits are possible). So for X_val=0, this case contributes 9 possibilities.

The other X_vals can't form any of the valid pairs. For example, X_val=5, the last two digits are 55. Which is not one of the valid pairs. So no contribution.

Only X_val=0 will contribute.

So total is 9.

Which matches the example.

So the code must handle this correctly.

So the code needs to:

1. For each possible X_val (0-9), check if there are Xs in the original string. If there are none, X_val is irrelevant (loop once).

2. For each X_val, generate s_prime by replacing all Xs in the original string with X_val.

3. Then, process s_prime as follows:

   a. If len(s_prime) ==1:

      check if s_prime can be replaced to 0. That is:

         if s_prime has '_', then the count is 1 (since replace with 0).

         if s_prime is '0', count is 1.

         else, 0.

   b. Else (len >=2):

      for each possible pair (a, b) in {'00', '25', '50', '75'}:

          check if the last two characters of s_prime can be set to a and b.

          For example, last two characters are c1 and c2.

          c1 must be a or '_'.

          c2 must be b or '_'.

          Wait, no. For c1 (the (n-2)th character):

              if it's a digit (from s_prime after X replacement), then it must equal a.

              if it's '_', then it can be replaced with a.

          Similarly for c2.

          So for c1 and c2:

              if (c1 is a digit and not equal to a) → invalid.

              if (c2 is a digit and not equal to b) → invalid.

          So for the last two characters:

              valid_pair = True

              if s_prime[-2] != '_' and s_prime[-2] != a → invalid.

              if s_prime[-1] != '_' and s_prime[-1] != b → invalid.

              if valid_pair → proceed.

          So, for example:

              s_prime ends with '_5'. For pair 25 → c1 must be '2' (so if c1 is '_', can be replaced with 2. Else, must be 2.

              So in this case, if the last two chars are '_5', and pair is 25 → c1 is '_', can be replaced with 2. c2 is 5, which equals b. So valid.

          So, code-wise:

              a_char = pair[0]

              b_char = pair[1]

              valid = True

              if s_prime[-2] not in (a_char, '_'):

                  valid = False

              if s_prime[-1] not in (b_char, '_'):

                  valid = False

              if not valid:

                  continue

              else:

                  process.

          Then, after confirming the pair is possible, check for leading zeros.

          Now, for len(s_prime) ==2:

              the first digit is a_char. If a_char is '0', then invalid.

              So, if a_char is '0', skip.

              else:

                  check if there are any underscores in the pair.

                  For example, if s_prime is '_5' → after replacement for pair 25 → the first character is '_', which must be replaced with 2. So the pair becomes 25. But for len 2, the first character is 2, which is okay.

                  But in this case, the code would have already checked that a_char is 2, so the first digit is 2, which is okay.

                  So for len 2 and a_char is non-zero → count 1 (if there are no underscores in the pair, or if there are underscores in the pair which are covered by the a_char and b_char).

                  So the possibilities for the pair is 1, multiplied by the number of ways to replace the underscores in the pair.

                  Wait, no. Because the pair's underscores are already considered. For example, if the s_prime is '__', then for pair '25', the last two digits can be set to 25 (two underscores → replaced with 2 and 5). But each underscore in the pair is part of the pair's characters. So how many possibilities are there for the pair?

                  Wait, the code needs to ensure that the last two characters can be set to a and b, which may require replacing underscores. But the number of ways to set them is 1 (since a and b are fixed). Because the code is considering each pair (a, b) as a candidate. So for each pair (a, b), the code is considering the scenario where the last two digits are exactly a and b. So the code counts the number of ways to replace the underscores in the last two digits to form a and b.

                  For example, in the case of s_prime last two digits being '_5', and pair is 25:

                      the first of the pair (last two digits) is '_', which must be replaced with 2.

                      the second is '5', which is already 5.

                      So there's one way to replace the first underscore with 2. So the pair is possible once.

                  So the code can proceed under the assumption that for each pair (a, b), the last two digits can be set to a and b. The code must check if the existing characters (after X replacement) in those positions are compatible with a and b.

                  So the code doesn't multiply by the number of ways to set the last two digits. Because for each pair (a, b), it's considered as a separate case, and the code must check if the existing characters allow the last two digits to be a and b. If yes, then it's counted as one possibility for this pair.

                  So the code's steps for each pair are:

                      check if the last two can be a and b.

                      if yes:

                          count the possibilities for the remaining part.

                          add that to the total for this x_val.

So, for each x_val and pair, the code calculates the number of valid ways to replace the underscores in the remaining part (leading to a valid number).

But the last two digits may have underscores which are replaced by a and b. For example, if the last two are '_', then for pair 25, they must be replaced with 2 and 5. So in that case, the code counts 1 way for the last two digits (since the pair is fixed as 25). The underscores in the remaining part are handled separately.

So the code's overall approach is:

for each x_val in possible_x_values:

   s_prime = replace Xs with x_val.

   if len(s_prime) ==1:

       can be zero? Check.

   else:

       for each pair in possible_pairs:

           check if last two can be set to pair.

           if yes:

               check if len(s_prime) ==2:

                   if pair[0] is '0' → invalid.

                   else → check if the two characters can be set to pair (which they can, since we already checked).

                   then, the remaining_part is empty. So possibilities_rest is 1 if there are no underscores in the last two digits (but since we are already considering pair, the underscores in the last two are replaced by a and b). Wait, but the code is processing each pair (a, b) as a possible candidate. For example, if the last two digits of s_prime are '_5', and pair is 25 → then the first character of the pair must be '2', which requires the underscore to be replaced with 2. So the code counts this as a valid possibility once (since the underscore can be replaced with 2). So the code's count for this pair and x_val is 1 multiplied by the possibilities in the remaining_part.

               else:

                   process the remaining_part.

So, the code for len(s_prime) >=2:

   for each pair in possible_pairs:

       check if last two can be set to a and b.

       if yes:

           check leading zeros.

           compute possibilities_rest.

           multiply by 1 (since the pair is fixed) and add to the count.

But also, in the pair, there may be underscores in the last two positions, but those are set to a and b. So the code counts this as valid once.

So the code's logic is:

For each x_val:

   process s_prime.

   for each pair:

       if the last two can be set to a and b:

           check if the entire number is valid (leading zeros and all).

           compute the number of ways to fill the remaining underscores.

           add to the count.

So the code needs to:

Handle len(s_prime) ==1.

Else:

   For each pair, check if last two can be set to a and b.

   Then, compute possibilities_rest based on remaining_part.

Putting this all together.

Now, the code needs to:

1. Check for all possible X values. For example, if there are no Xs in the original string, then X can be any digit, but since there are no Xs, it's processed once.

So, code-wise:

original_s = input().strip()

has_x = 'X' in original_s

if has_x:

   x_values = range(0, 10)

else:

   x_values = [None]  # dummy value, but code will replace Xs (none) with x_val, which doesn't affect the string.

total = 0

for x_val in x_values:

   s_prime = original_s.replace('X', str(x_val) if x_val is not None else 'X')  # but if has_x is False, this is original_s.

   # process s_prime...

Wait, but if there are no Xs, then 'X' is not present in original_s, so replacing Xs with x_val (even if x_val is None) will not change the string. So in this case, s_prime = original_s.

But when has_x is False, x_values is [None], and the loop runs once.

So in code:

for x_val in x_values:

   if has_x:

       x_str = str(x_val)

       s_prime = original_s.replace('X', x_str)

   else:

       s_prime = original_s

   # process s_prime...

Now, processing s_prime.

Case 1: len(s_prime) ==1:

   the number must be 0.

   So:

   if s_prime == '_' → replace with 0 → valid. Count +=1.

   elif s_prime == '0' → valid. Count +=1.

   else: no.

Case 2: len >=2:

   for each pair in possible_pairs:

       a, b = pair[0], pair[1]

       # check last two characters can be set to a and b.

       valid = True

       if len(s_prime) >=2:

           c1 = s_prime[-2]

           c2 = s_prime[-1]

           if c1 not in (a, '_'):

               valid = False

           if c2 not in (b, '_'):

               valid = False

       else:

           valid = False

       if not valid:

           continue

       # Now, check if the entire number has leading zeros.

       # process remaining_part:

       remaining_part = s_prime[:-2]

       # Check if len(s_prime) is 2:

       if len(s_prime) == 2:

           # the entire number is a and b. So a must not be 0.

           if a == '0':

               continue

           # else, check if remaining_part is empty.

           # remaining_part is empty.

           # check if there are underscores in the last two characters.

           # but the code has already checked that the last two can be a and b.

           # So the number of ways to replace the last two characters is 1 (as pair is fixed).

           # Then, check the remaining_part (empty) and count.

           # remaining_part is empty. So first digit is a.

           # which is non-zero.

           # So possibilities_rest is 1.

           # But also, check if the remaining_part has any underscores.

           # Since remaining_part is empty, no underscores.

           possibilities_rest = 1

       else:

           # process remaining_part.

           # remaining_part is s_prime[:-2]

           if not remaining_part:

               # but len(s_prime) >=2 but not 2? No. For example, len(s_prime) is 3. remaining_part is s_prime[0], len 1.

               # So code proceeds.

           # Check first character of remaining_part.

           first_char = remaining_part[0] if remaining_part else None

           # remaining_part is the part before the last two digits.

           # So if len(s_prime) is 3, remaining_part is s_prime[0]

           # So the first_char is s_prime[0]

           # Now, check if the first_char is a digit.

           if remaining_part:

               first_char = remaining_part[0]

               if first_char == '_':

                   # the first_char is an underscore. Can be replaced with 1-9.

                   underscores_rest = sum(c == '_' for c in remaining_part[1:])

                   possibilities_rest = 9 * (10 ** underscores_rest)

               else:

                   if first_char == '0':

                       # leading zero. invalid.

                       possibilities_rest = 0

                   else:

                       # first_char is non-zero. count underscores in remaining_part[1:]

                       underscores_rest = sum(c == '_' for c in remaining_part[1:])

                       possibilities_rest = 10 ** underscores_rest

           else:

               # remaining_part is empty. len(s_prime) is 2, handled earlier.

               possibilities_rest = 1

       # Now, check if possibilities_rest is greater than 0.

       if possibilities_rest ==0:

           continue

       # Also, check if there are any underscores in the last two characters.

       # For example, if the last two characters are '_' and '_', then to set them to a and b, there is one way.

       # But in the code, we are considering each pair (a, b) as a separate case, and the code is counting the number of ways to replace the underscores in the remaining_part.

       # The code has already handled the last two characters by checking that they can be set to a and b. So the code proceeds.

       total += possibilities_rest

So, putting this all together into code.

But wait, the code must also check that the remaining_part has no conflicting digits. For example, if remaining_part is 'A5_', then after X replacement, it's 'A5_', where A is a digit or underscore.

So, if the remaining_part has a fixed digit (non-underscore), then the code must ensure that it's allowed. For example, if the remaining_part is 'A5_', and A is a digit (e.g., '0'), then the code would check if the first character is zero. If yes, invalid.

So the code is correct in processing the remaining_part's first character.

So, the code steps are:

For each x_val in possible_x_values:

   generate s_prime.

   if len(s_prime) ==1:

       if s_prime can be replaced to 0:

           count +=1 (for this x_val).

   else:

       for each pair in possible_pairs:

           check if last two can be set to a and b.

           if yes:

               compute possibilities_rest.

               add possibilities_rest to total.

So, the code can be written as follows.

Now, let's test the code with some examples.

Example 2:

Input: _00.

Output: 9.

Processing:

The input has no Xs. So x_values is [None].

s_prime = original_s, which is '_00'.

len(s_prime) is 3. So len >=2.

Process each pair.

Possible pairs are 00, 25, 50, 75.

For pair 00:

check last two can be 00.

s_prime's last two are '0' and '0'.

So a is '0', b is '0'.

The last two characters are '0' and '0', which match. So valid.

remaining_part is '_'.

Processing remaining_part:

first_char is '_'.

So possibilities_rest is 9 * 10^0 =9.

len(s_prime) is 3, so not 2. So no problem.

So possibilities_rest is 9. Add to total.

For other pairs:

25, 50, 75:

last two characters are '0' and '0', which do not match the pair. So invalid.

So total is 9.

Which matches the example.

Another example: input is '0', output is 1.

Processing:

s_prime is '0' (since no Xs).

len(s_prime) is 1.

Check if it can be 0. Yes. So count +=1.

Another example: input is '0_25'.

The output is 0.

Processing:

The input is '0_25'. No Xs.

s_prime is '0_25'.

len is 4.

For each pair (00, 25, 50, 75):

Take pair 25.

Check if last two can be 25.

s_prime's last two are '2' and '5'. So a=2, b=5.

Check if s_prime[-2] is '2' → yes (since the input is '0_25', s_prime is '0_25', last two are '5' and '2'? Wait, wait no.

Wait, the input is '0_25'. So the string is:

positions 0: '0'

position 1: '_'

position 2: '2'

position 3: '5'.

So last two are '2' and '5' → pair 25 would require a=2, b=5.

Check if s_prime[-2] is '2' → yes. s_prime[-1] is '5' → yes. So pair 25 is valid.

remaining_part is '0_'.

First character is '0' → which is a digit. But for a number of length 4, the first digit must not be zero. So this case is invalid.

Thus, possibilities_rest is zero. So pair 25 contributes nothing.

Other pairs like 00: last two are '2' and '5' which can't be set to 00.

So all pairs contribute zero. So total is zero.

Thus, output is 0.

Which matches the example.

Another example: input 'X' → possible X_val from 0-9.

Each X_val will replace X. So s_prime is '0' to '9' (len 1).

Only when X_val is 0, s_prime is '0' → valid. So count 1.

Thus, output is 1.

So the code should handle these cases.

Now, the code.

The code needs to:

Read the input string.

Check if it has Xs. If yes, loop over x_val 0-9. Else, loop once.

For each x_val:

   replace Xs with x_val.

   process s_prime.

   if len(s_prime) ==1:

       check if can be 0.

   else:

       loop over pairs.

       check last two can be a and b.

       compute possibilities_rest.

       add to total.

So, the code:

possible_pairs = ['00', '25', '50', '75']

original_s = input().strip()

has_x = 'X' in original_s

total = 0

x_values = range(10) if has_x else [None]

for x_val in x_values:

    if has_x:

        s_prime = original_s.replace('X', str(x_val))

    else:

        s_prime = original_s

    n = len(s_prime)

    if n == 1:

        # must be 0

        if s_prime == '_':

            total += 1

        elif s_prime == '0':

            total += 1

        continue

    # else, process pairs

    for pair in possible_pairs:

        a, b = pair[0], pair[1]

        # Check last two can be a and b

        valid = True

        if len(s_prime) < 2:

            valid = False

        else:

            c1 = s_prime[-2]

            c2 = s_prime[-1]

            if c1 not in (a, '_'):

                valid = False

            if c2 not in (b, '_'):

                valid = False

        if not valid:

            continue

        # Check if len is 2

        if len(s_prime) == 2:

            if a == '0':

                continue

            # else, remaining_part is empty

            possibilities_rest = 1

        else:

            remaining_part = s_prime[:-2]

            # process remaining_part

            if not remaining_part:

                possibilities_rest = 1

            else:

                first_char = remaining_part[0]

                if first_char == '_':

                    # can be 1-9: 9 options

                    underscores_rest = remaining_part[1:].count('_')

                    possibilities_rest = 9 * (10 ** underscores_rest)

                elif first_char == '0':

                    # leading zero, invalid

                    possibilities_rest = 0

                else:

                    # first_char is non-zero digit

                    underscores_rest = remaining_part[1:].count('_')

                    possibilities_rest = 10 ** underscores_rest

        # add to total

        total += possibilities_rest

print(total)

Now, let's test this code against the examples.

Example 1: input '25'. Output 1.

s_prime is '25' (no Xs). len is 2.

Processing pair 25:

a = '2', b='5'.

last two are '2' and '5' → valid.

len is 2, so a != '0' → valid.

possibilities_rest is 1.

Other pairs are not valid.

So total is 1.

Correct.

Example 2: input '_00'. Output 9.

No Xs. s_prime is '_00'.

n=3.

Processing pair '00':

last two are '0' and '0' → valid.

remaining_part is '_'.

first_char is '_' → 9 options.

underscores_rest is 0.

possibilities_rest =9 * 1 →9.

Other pairs invalid.

Total 9.

Correct.

Example3: input '_XX'. Output 9.

X present.

x_val loops 0-9.

For x_val=0:

s_prime becomes '_00'.

Processing pair '00':

last two are 0 and 0 → valid.

remaining_part is '_'.

possibilities_rest is 9.

For other x_vals:

pair 00 will have s_prime's last two as x_val x_val. So only x_val=0 would allow pair 00.

So code adds 9 for x_val=0.

Other x_vals can't form any valid pairs.

Total 9.

Correct.

Example4: input '0'. Output 1.

n=1. s_prime is '0' → valid. Total 1.

Example5: input '0_25'. Output 0.

Processing:

x_val is None (no Xs).

s_prime is '0_25'.

n=4.

Check pairs:

For pair 25:

last two are '2' and '5' → valid.

remaining_part is '0_'.

first_char is '0' → invalid. possibilities_rest is 0.

Other pairs:

like 00: last two must be '0' and '0', but s_prime's last two are '2' and '5' → invalid.

Thus, total 0.

Correct.

Another test case: input 'XX' → possible x_val 0-9.

For x_val=5, s_prime is '55'. pairs:

possible pairs are 00,25,50,75. '55' is not any of them. So no contribution.

For x_val=0: s_prime is '00'. pair 00:

a='0', len 2 → a is zero → invalid.

So no contribution.

For x_val=2: s_prime is '22'. no valid pairs.

Thus, total is zero.

Another test case: input 'X5', X can be 2.

s_prime becomes '25' → pair 25 is valid. len 2, a is '2' → valid.

possibilities_rest=1. So for x_val=2, it's 1. Other x_vals may not form valid pairs. So total is 1.

Another test case: input 'X_', X can be 2. s_prime is '2_'. pair 25: last two can be 2 and 5 if the '_' is replaced with 5. So pair 25 is possible. remaining_part is empty (n=2). a=2 → non-zero. possibilities_rest=1. So for x_val=2, this contributes 1. For other pairs, not valid. So total is 1.

But wait, the code is for each pair and x_val. So for x_val=2, s_prime is '2_'.

For pair 25, last two can be set to 2 and 5. s_prime's last two are '2' and '_', which can be set to 2 and 5 (the '_' can be replaced with 5). So valid.

Then, len is 2. a is '2' → valid. possibilities_rest=1.

So for x_val=2, code adds 1.

Other pairs: for example, pair 75 → last two can be set to 7 and 5? s_prime is '2_'. a=7 → s_prime's first character of the pair is '2' → cannot be 7. So invalid.

Thus, total is 1.

Thus, the code seems to handle these cases.

So this code should work.
