Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to count the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by merging the two given sequences (from a and b) such that the x-coordinates are non-decreasing. Each sequence has n points, and each element must be used exactly once. The sequences are considered distinct if at any position the (pi, qi) pairs differ.

First, let's think about the constraints. The problem says that n can be up to 1e5, which suggests that any O(n^2) approach is going to be way too slow. So, we need an O(n log n) solution or something similar.

The key here is that the merged sequence must have non-decreasing x-coordinates. So, when merging the a's and b's, each step must choose a point whose x is not less than the previous one. However, since all points are from a and b sequences, perhaps the order in which we can merge depends on the sorted order of a and b.

Wait, but each a is (ai, i) and each b is (bi, i). Wait, noâ€” the original sequences are for the a's, each point is (ai, i), where i is their position in their original sequence. Similarly for the b's. So each a element is (a1, 1), (a2, 2), etc. Similarly for b. So when we merge, each element from a and b must be used exactly once. So the merged sequence is a combination of all 2n elements, but arranged in an order where the x's are non-decreasing, and each a and b element is used exactly once.

But since the problem counts sequences as distinct even if the same x's but different qi (which is the original sequence's index), even if two points have the same x but different i, they are considered different. So the main thing is the order in which the a and b elements are merged, ensuring that their x's are non-decreasing.

Wait, but for the x's to be non-decreasing in the merged sequence, the order in which we take a and b elements must be such that each next element's x is >= previous x.

So the problem reduces to merging the two sequences (all a and b elements) in a way that their x's are non-decreasing. But since each a and b element must be used exactly once, this is equivalent to interleaving the a and b sequences, but in a way that the x's are non-decreasing.

But how do the a and b elements compare? Let's think: for each i, the a sequence has a point (ai, i), and the b sequence has (bi, i). So each element in a and b has the same "original" index i, but different x-coordinates (ai and bi). Wait, no: the original sequences are for each of the a's and b's. So for example, the a sequence is (a1,1), (a2,2), ..., (an,n), and the b sequence is (b1,1), (b2,2), ..., (bn,n). So each of the 2n elements has a unique (x, y) where y is the original index (but they can be the same across a and b, since the a and b sequences have the same indexes). So the merged sequence is a permutation of all 2n elements (each from a and b exactly once), such that the x's are non-decreasing.

Wait, but each of the a and b elements must be used exactly once. So for each index i in the original sequences (from 1 to n), we have two elements: one from a (ai, i) and one from b (bi, i). These are two separate points. So in the merged sequence, exactly one from each pair (ai, i) and (bi, i) is present. Wait, no: the problem statement says that each element of the initial sequences is used exactly once. Wait, the initial sequences are the a sequence and the b sequence. Each has n elements. So the merged sequence is combining all 2n elements. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: "each element of the initial sequences should be used exactly once in the assembled sequence." So the a sequence has n elements, the b sequence has n elements. So the merged sequence has exactly 2n elements, all from a and b, each used once. Oh right, that makes sense. So the merged sequence is a way of interleaving all a and b elements (each once), such that their x's are non-decreasing.

Wait, but the original a and b sequences are each of length n. So the merged sequence has 2n elements. So the problem is about interleaving the two sequences (using all elements from a and all from b) such that the x's are non-decreasing. But how?

Let's think of the merged sequence as a permutation of the 2n elements (all a and b elements), arranged in a way that x is non-decreasing. However, the same x can have different y's (the original index), which would count as distinct sequences even if x is the same.

But the problem is to count the number of such permutations where the x's are non-decreasing. However, considering that the same x values can be arranged in any order as long as they are non-decreasing. Wait, no. For example, if two elements have x = 5, they can be in any order relative to each other in the merged sequence, but the x's must not decrease. So, the order of elements with the same x can vary, but they must be placed in a non-decreasing way (but since x is the same, their order can be any). However, each such arrangement where their positions are swapped would count as a distinct sequence.

Wait, no. Because the problem counts two sequences as distinct if any position differs. So, even if two elements have the same x, swapping their positions creates a different sequence. So, the number of valid sequences is the product of the possible permutations within groups of elements with the same x. Wait, no. Because when elements have the same x, their order can be arbitrary, but the merged sequence must be non-decreasing. So, elements with the same x can be arranged in any order, as long as they come after elements with x <= their x and before elements with x >= their x. So, the number of valid sequences is the product of the factorial of the counts of elements in each group of equal x, multiplied by the number of ways to interleave the groups.

Wait, but perhaps the problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Collect all 2n elements (from a and b sequences) and sort them by x. If two elements have the same x, they can be arranged in any order relative to each other. So, the total number of valid sequences is the product of the factorials of the counts of elements in each group of the same x.

But wait, that's only true if all elements in the same x group are contiguous. Because if elements with x = k are spread out, then their positions may not be allowed. For example, if you have elements x1, x2, x3 with x1 < x2 = x2 < x3, then all x2 elements must be placed between x1 and x3, but their order can vary. But if elements are sorted, then their order can vary in the entire sequence as long as all x's are non-decreasing. Wait, no. Because in order for the x's to be non-decreasing, the elements must be arranged in a non-decreasing order of x. So, the only valid sequences are those that are permutations of the sorted list, where the x's are non-decreasing. Which is equivalent to the entire sequence being sorted by x, but allowing any order among elements with the same x. So, the total number of such sequences is the product of the factorials of the counts of each x group. For example, if there are three elements with x=5 and two with x=6, then the total sequences would be 3! * 2!.

But wait, that's only the case if all elements are sorted, but their order within the same x group is arbitrary. So the total number of valid sequences is indeed the product of the factorials of the counts of each x group. However, in our problem, the elements are already part of two different sequences (a and b), and when sorted, they need to be merged in such a way that the x's are non-decreasing.

Wait, but the problem isn't exactly that. Because the merged sequence is a permutation of all 2n elements (a and b), arranged such that their x's are non-decreasing. So the total number of valid sequences is indeed the product of the factorials of the counts of each x value. Because for each group of elements with the same x, they can be arranged in any order among themselves. So, if in the merged sorted list there are k elements with x equal to some value, they contribute k! to the total count.

But then, why does the first sample input give 1? Let's see.

In the first sample input, n=1. The a sequence is (1,1), and the b sequence is (2,1). So the merged list must have two elements. The possible sequences are [(1,1), (2,1)] and [(2,1), (1,1)]. But only the first sequence is valid because the x's must be non-decreasing. So the answer is 1. Which aligns with the product of the factorials of the counts. The x's are 1 and 2. The counts are 1 and 1, so the product is 1! * 1! = 1. Correct.

In the second sample input, n=2. The a sequence is (1,1), (2,2). The b sequence is (2,1), (3,2). So the merged list has four elements. Let's list them sorted by x:

x=1: (1,1) from a.

x=2: (2,2) from a, (2,1) from b.

x=3: (3,2) from b.

So, the groups are:

x=1: count 1.

x=2: count 2.

x=3: count 1.

The product is 1! * 2! * 1! = 2. Which matches the sample output.

So this suggests that the solution is:

- Collect all 2n elements (each from a and b) into a list.

- Sort this list by x.

- For each group of elements with the same x, compute the size of the group (k), and multiply the result by k! modulo m.

- However, there's a catch: what if there are elements in the same x group, but their original positions (the 'i' in (ai, i) and (bi, i)) are the same? For example, if for a certain i, ai = bi. Then, when merged, the two elements (ai, i) from a and (bi, i) from b would have the same x and same y (since i is same). Wait, no. Because (ai, i) is part of the a sequence, and (bi, i) is part of the b sequence. So, even if ai=bi, their y is i for both, but they are two different elements. Wait, but wait: the a elements are (ai, i), and the b elements are (bi, i). So if ai=bi and i is same, then both elements have the same x and same y. So they would be considered the same point. But according to the problem statement, when such elements are in the same position in the merged sequence, the sequence is considered the same. Wait, but the problem says that two sequences are distinct if there exists an i where (pi, qi) != (xi, yi). So if two elements are the same (same x and y), swapping them would not make the sequences distinct. So, in such a case, if two elements are identical (same x and y), then their order in the group doesn't matter. But in the problem, each element from a and b must be used exactly once. So if ai=bi and same i, then the two elements (ai,i) are present in the merged list. So, when sorted, they would have the same x and same y. But in that case, swapping them in the merged sequence would result in the same sequence. Therefore, the count for such a group is not 2! (which is 2) but 1, because the two elements are identical.

Ah, this is a crucial point. So, if two elements in the same x group are identical (same x and same y), then their order in the sequence does not affect the distinctness of the sequence. Therefore, when calculating the product of factorials, we must account for duplicates. That is, for each group of elements with the same x, we need to compute the product of (count for each distinct (x, y) in the group) factorial. Because if there are duplicates in (x, y), then the permutations of those duplicates do not contribute to distinct sequences.

Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, the elements are distinct if any (pi, qi) pair differs. So, each element in the merged list is from a or b. For example, if a has (x=2, y=1) and b has (x=2, y=1), then those are two separate elements. However, in the merged sequence, they are considered the same. Because (pi, qi) is (2,1) for both. So, if they are in the same x group (which they are), swapping them would not create a new sequence. Because in the merged sequence, the two elements are identical. So, for a group where two elements are the same (same x and y), their order in the group does not contribute to distinct sequences.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

For each x group:

- Count the number of elements in the group.

- But also, for each (x, y) pair in the group, count how many times each occurs.

Then, the contribution to the product is the product of (k! / (d1! * d2! * ... * dn! )), where d1, d2, ... are the counts of each duplicate (x,y) pair in the group. However, since (x,y) pairs are unique except for when the same element is present in both a and b. Wait, no. Each a and b element is from their own sequences. So, (x,y) pairs can only be duplicated if, for some i, ai = bi. Because then, the a element (ai, i) and the b element (bi, i) would be the same (x,y) pair. But in that case, they are two separate elements in the merged list, but when placed in the same group, their order would not affect the sequence's distinctness.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the elements from a and b are used exactly once. So, for example, if (ai, i) and (bi, i) are both in the group (same x), then even if ai = bi, those are two distinct elements. But since their x and y are the same, swapping them in the sequence would result in the same sequence. Therefore, for each (x,y) pair in the group, the number of duplicates (i.e., how many times that (x,y) occurs) must be considered. Because the number of distinct ways to arrange the group is (k! / product (d! )) where d is the count of each (x,y) in the group.

So the formula for each group is the product of the factorial of the group's size divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each (x,y) in the group.

But how can (x,y) pairs repeat in the group? Only if, for a certain i, ai = bi. Because then, a and b each contribute a (ai, i) element. So the merged group would have two elements with the same (x,y) pair. So, when calculating the group's contribution, for such pairs, their duplicates must be considered.

For example, suppose a group has two elements with (2,1) and two elements with (2,2). Then the group has four elements, but with two pairs of duplicates. The number of distinct ways would be 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6. So each group's contribution is the multinomial coefficient considering the duplicates.

Therefore, the approach is:

1. Collect all 2n elements (from a and b) into a list.

2. Sort them by their x-coordinate. If x is same, their order can be arbitrary for the purpose of grouping.

3. For each group of elements with the same x:

   a. Count the total number of elements in the group (k).

   b. For each (x,y) in the group, count how many times it appears (d).

   c. Compute the contribution for this group: (k! ) / (product of d! for each (x,y) in the group).

   d. Multiply all such contributions together modulo m.

4. The result is the product of all group contributions modulo m.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

The problem is that for n up to 1e5, 2n elements is up to 2e5. Sorting them is O(n log n), which is acceptable.

Then, for each group, we need to count the occurrences of each (x,y) pair. But for 2e5 elements, this could be O(2e5) time in total, which is acceptable.

The main challenge is calculating the factorials and the inverses for the denominator. Because when m is not a prime, we can't use modular inverses directly. So, how to compute (k! / product d! ) mod m?

But since m can be composite, and up to 1e9+7, which is a prime, but the problem states m can be anything >=2. So, we need to compute the product of (k! / product d! ) for all groups, modulo m. However, division in modular arithmetic is tricky unless m is prime and the denominator is coprime with m.

Wait, but division modulo m is possible only if the denominator and m are coprime. So, if m is not a prime, but the denominators are coprime with m, then we can compute the inverse. Otherwise, division is not possible.

But in our problem, the denominator is the product of factorials of duplicates. So, for example, if m is even, and the denominator is 2, then the inverse of 2 mod m exists only if m is odd. But if m is even, then 2 and m are not coprime, so inverse doesn't exist. Therefore, the approach of computing the denominator's inverse may not be feasible.

So, this suggests that the standard approach of precomputing factorials modulo m and their inverses would not work for arbitrary m. Therefore, we need to find another way to compute (k! / product of d! ) mod m, even when m is composite.

But how?

An alternative approach is to compute the product as (k! * inv(d1!) * inv(d2!) * ... ), where inv is the modular inverse. But this requires that each d! is coprime with m. If any d! and m are not coprime, then the inverse does not exist, and this approach fails.

Hmm. So, how can we compute the value (k! / product d! ) mod m when the denominator's factors may not be coprime with m?

This seems challenging. Let's think. Let's express the problem as:

result = (product over all groups of (k! / (product d! )) ) mod m.

Which can be written as:

result = (product of k! ) / (product of product d! ) mod m.

But division in modular arithmetic is equivalent to multiplying by the modular inverse of the denominator. But since m can be composite, the denominator and m may not be coprime, so the inverse may not exist. So, this approach may not work.

Another way: factor m into its prime factors and compute the exponents of each prime in the numerator and denominator, then subtract the exponents and compute the product modulo m. However, for m up to 1e9+7, factoring m is time-consuming, but since m is given once per test case, perhaps it's manageable. However, given the constraints (n up to 1e5), this approach might be feasible.

Alternatively, since the modulus is m, perhaps we can compute the numerator and denominator modulo m, and then compute the result. But if m is not prime, then the division may not be possible. However, perhaps we can represent the product as (numerator * denominator_inverse) mod m, but only if the denominator and m are coprime. If not, then the result is undefined. But the problem requires that the answer is possible to compute. So perhaps the division is always possible, but that's not the case.

Wait, in the problem statement, what if the denominator and m share a common divisor? For example, m is 4, and the denominator is 2. Then, 2 and 4 are not coprime, so the inverse of 2 mod 4 does not exist. Then, the division 2/2 mod 4 is 1, but if the denominator is 2 and the numerator is 4, then 4 / 2 = 2 mod 4 is 2. But how to compute this without division.

So, perhaps the solution is to compute the product as the product of (k! * inv) where inv is the modular inverse of the product of d! for the group. However, if the product of d! and m are not coprime, then we cannot compute the inverse, and thus this approach would fail.

But how can we handle such cases?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by precomputing the factorials modulo m, but for each group, compute the product of factorials of the counts of (x,y) pairs in the group, then compute the inverse of that product modulo m, and multiply by the factorial of k, then multiply everything modulo m. However, this would require that for each group, the product of the d! and m are coprime, which is not guaranteed.

So this suggests that this approach would not work for all cases.

Alternative approach: realize that when we have (k! / product d! ), the division is exact. Because each d! is a product of integers <=k, so the product divides k! . For example, in the case where a group has k elements, with counts d1, d2, ..., dk (summing to k), the multinomial coefficient k!/(d1! d2! ... dk! ) is an integer. So the problem is to compute this integer modulo m.

So, the key is that even if m is composite, the division is exact, so there's an integer value for (k! / product d! ), and we can compute it modulo m.

But how to compute this value modulo m when m is not prime?

The way to handle this is to compute the numerator (k! ) and the denominator (product of d! ), and then compute the value as (numerator * inverse_denominator) mod m. But again, the inverse_denominator exists only if the denominator and m are coprime. But since the division is exact, the denominator divides the numerator, which implies that the denominator divides k! . So, when computing the value modulo m, the denominator may not divide the numerator modulo m, but the overall result is an integer. So, the approach would be to compute (k! // (d1! * d2! * ... )) mod m. But how to compute this when division is not possible via modular inverses.

An alternative approach is to compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m by breaking down the numerator and denominator into their prime factors, then subtract the exponents in the denominator from the numerator and multiply the remaining primes modulo m. However, this would be computationally expensive for large k (up to 2e5).

But for n up to 1e5, and 2n elements, this approach might not be feasible. So what's another way?

Wait, perhaps we can compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m as follows:

Compute k! modulo (m * product d! ), then divide by product d! . The result is (k! / product d! ) mod m. But this is possible because product d! divides k! , so the division is exact. Then, the modulus can be taken.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, note that the multinomial coefficient is an integer. So, (k! / product d! ) mod m can be computed by first computing the product of all the factorials of the group sizes (k! ), then multiply by the inverses of the product of d! for each group. However, this requires that each d! for a group can be inverted modulo m, which is not guaranteed.

But the problem is that the denominator and m may have common factors. In such cases, the inverse does not exist, and this approach fails. So this suggests that the standard approach of using modular inverses is not applicable here.

So, what's another approach?

Another way is to compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m directly, by handling the division as exact division. For example, compute k! mod (m * product d! ), then divide by product d! , then take mod m. Since product d! divides k! , this division is exact, and the result is an integer. Then, taking mod m gives the desired value.

But for large m and product d! , this might not be feasible, as the product m * product d! can be very large (up to m * (2e5)! ), which is impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m by incrementally multiplying factors and dividing when possible. Let's think.

For each group:

We need to compute (k! / product d! ) mod m.

Let's compute k! mod (m * product d! ), then divide by product d! . The result is (k! / product d! ) mod m.

But how to compute this without dealing with huge numbers.

Alternatively, for each group, compute the multinomial coefficient by multiplying the numbers from 1 to k, and for each number, check if it's present in any of the d! factors in the denominator. If yes, divide by that factor. But even that approach can be time-consuming for large k.

Another approach is to compute the product of the numerator and denominator factorials, but in a way that cancels the denominator factors. For example, for each group:

The numerator is k! .

The denominator is product of (d1! * d2! * ... * dn! ), where each di is the count of a particular (x,y) pair in the group.

So, the multinomial coefficient is (k! ) / (d1! * d2! * ... * dn! )

To compute this mod m, perhaps we can compute k! mod (m * denominator), then divide by denominator, then take mod m. But this would require that denominator is not zero mod m*denominator, which it isn't.

But with k up to 2e5 and denominator up to (2e5)! , this is impossible to compute directly.

Hmm. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let's think about the multinomial coefficient. For example, suppose k is 5, and the denominator is 2! * 3! = 12. Then, the coefficient is 5! / (2!3! )= 120/(2*6) = 10.

But how to compute this mod m.

Another approach is to precompute the numerator and the denominator, then compute the division. However, for large k, this would involve very large numbers. But since we need the result modulo m, perhaps we can compute the numerator and denominator modulo m * denominator. But again, the denominator could be very large.

Alternatively, for each group, the product of the denominator factorials is the product of d! for each (x,y) in the group. Let's call this denominator_product.

The multinomial coefficient is (k! ) / denominator_product.

We can compute this by:

1. Compute the factorial k! modulo (m * denominator_product).

But this is again impossible for large denominator_product.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end.

Alternative idea: Since the division is exact, the multinomial coefficient is an integer. So, we can compute it as (k! // denominator_product) mod m.

But how to compute this without big integers.

Another approach is to factor all the numbers in the numerator and denominator into their prime factors, then subtract the exponents of the denominator's primes from the numerator's exponents, and multiply the remaining primes modulo m.

But this would require factoring numbers up to 2e5, which is feasible. Let's see.

But for each group, the maximum k is up to 2e5, which is manageable.

So, the steps would be:

For each group:

- Compute the prime factors of k! and subtract the factors of denominator_product (product of d! for each (x,y) in group).

- Multiply the remaining prime factors, each raised to their respective exponents, modulo m.

But even this is computationally expensive for large groups, but perhaps manageable with precomputed prime factors.

Alternatively, we can compute the exponents of each prime in the numerator and denominator, then compute the exponents in the multinomial coefficient.

But how to compute exponents of primes in k! ?

The exponents of a prime p in k! is given by sum_{i=1 to infinity} floor(k/p^i).

Similarly, for each d! in the denominator, the exponents are sum_{i=1 to infinity} floor(d/p^i).

So, for each prime p in the factorization of the numerator and denominator, compute the exponent in the numerator (k! ) and subtract the exponents from the denominator (sum of exponents from each d! ). The resulting exponent is the exponent of p in the multinomial coefficient.

Once we have all the primes and their exponents in the multinomial coefficient, multiply them all modulo m.

But for large k (up to 2e5) and m up to 1e9+7, this approach is feasible?

The problem is that for each group, we need to consider all primes up to 2e5. For n up to 1e5, and each group potentially being of size up to 2e5, this would be O(2e5 log 2e5) per group, which is O(1e10) operations. This is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Since the denominator is a product of factorials, and the multinomial coefficient is an integer, perhaps we can compute the coefficient modulo m using dynamic programming.

But how?

Alternatively, we can compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m by multiplying the numbers from 1 to k, and for each number, dividing by the numbers in the denominator's factorials. For example:

Initialize the result as 1.

For i in 1 to k:

   result *= i

   for each d in denominator_factors:

       if d has a factor of i, then divide result by i.

But this approach is not clear.

Wait, for example, the denominator is 2! * 3! = 2 * 6 = 12.

The numerator is 5! = 120.

The multinomial coefficient is 120 /12 = 10.

So, the idea is to multiply all numbers from 1 to 5, and for each number, check if it is part of the denominator's factors.

But 12 is 2*2*3. So, when multiplying 1, 2, 3, 4,5:

At i=2: multiply by 2. denominator has two 2's and one 3.

So, after multiplying by 2, result is 2. Then, if there's a denominator factor of 2, we divide by one 2.

But this approach would require tracking the factors of the denominator and dividing as we go. However, keeping track of which factors have been used and how many times is challenging.

Another approach: precompute the denominator's factors as a multiset (prime factors). For example, denominator 12 factors into 2^2, 3^1. Then, when computing the product of numbers from 1 to k, for each prime in the denominator's factors, we subtract the exponents as we multiply. For example:

Initialize the numerator product as 1.

For each number i from 1 to k:

   temp = i

   for each prime p in denominator's factors:

       while temp is divisible by p and the count for p in denominator is >0:

           temp /= p

           denominator's count for p is decremented by 1.

   multiply temp into the numerator product modulo m.

But this approach is not feasible for large denominators. For example, if the denominator's factors are up to 2e5, then for each i up to 2e5, we have to check all primes in the denominator's factors. This could be O(2e5 * number of primes in denominator) operations, which is again way too slow.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. How can we compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m when m is not prime, and the denominator may have factors that are not coprime with m.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m by using the multiplicative inverses of the denominator's factors, but only for the primes that are coprime with m, and handle the other factors by adjusting the exponents.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved using the following approach:

For each group:

   Compute the multinomial coefficient as (k! ) // (product of d! ), then take mod m.

But the problem is that k! can be extremely large, and we can't compute it directly. However, since we need the result modulo m, perhaps we can compute the product modulo m * product of d! , then divide by product of d! , and then take modulo m.

Wait, let's see:

Let D = product of d! .

We can compute k! mod (D * m). Then, since D divides k! , (k! mod (D * m)) is equal to (k! ) - t * D * m for some t. So, when divided by D, it's (k! / D ) - t * m. So, mod m, it's (k! / D ) mod m.

Thus, the approach would be:

Compute k! modulo (D * m). Then divide by D, which is exact, to get (k! / D ) mod m.

But how to compute k! mod (D * m) when D can be up to (2e5)! ?

But for large D, this is impossible. For example, when k is 2e5, D could be (2e5)! , making D * m up to (2e5)! * 1e9+7, which is way beyond what can be stored or computed.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: note that the denominator D is the product of the factorials of the counts of each (x,y) pair in the group. For example, if a group has elements with counts d1, d2, ..., then D = d1! * d2! * ... .

We can compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m by calculating the product of the numbers from 1 to k, and for each number, divide it by the factors in D.

But how to track which factors in D to divide by.

Perhaps, we can precompute all the factors in D as a list of primes and their exponents, then for each number in the factorial (1 to k), divide it by as many primes from D as possible, and multiply the remainder into the result modulo m.

But how to do this.

Let's think step by step:

For each group:

1. Compute D = product of (d! ) for each (x,y) count d.

2. Factor D into its prime factors, obtaining a dictionary where key is the prime, value is the exponent.

3. Compute k! modulo m, but during the computation, for each prime in D's factors, subtract the exponents as they are encountered.

Wait, but how?

Alternative approach:

For each group:

   Compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m as follows:

   Initialize the result as 1.

   For i from 1 to k:

      temp = i

      for each prime p in D's factors:

          while D's exponents for p >0 and temp % p ==0:

              temp = temp // p

              D's exponents[p] -=1

      result = (result * temp) % m

   After processing all i from 1 to k, multiply the remaining primes in D's factors (but since D divides k! , all exponents should have been reduced to zero).

But this approach requires factorizing D for each group, which could be expensive. However, for each group, the D is the product of factorials of the counts of (x,y) pairs. So for each group, the D can be computed as the product of d! for each (x,y) pair in the group.

But factorizing each d! is possible by noting that the prime factors of d! are the sum of exponents of each prime up to d.

But this again seems computationally heavy.

Wait, but perhaps we can precompute for each d (up to 2e5) the exponents of each prime in d! . But for d up to 2e5 and primes up to 2e5, this would require O(2e5 * number of primes up to 2e5) storage, which is about 2e5 * 2e4 (approx, since the number of primes up to 2e5 is around 2e4) which is 4e9, which is not feasible.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: for each group, the D is the product of d! for each (x,y) pair in the group. So for each group, to compute D, we can compute the product of the factorials of the counts. But for the multinomial coefficient, we need to compute k! / D mod m. So, perhaps we can compute this as follows:

Compute the product of numbers from 1 to k, but for each number, divide it by the factors of D.

But how?

Another way: for each group, collect all the factors in D. For example, D is product of d! for each (x,y) pair. So, each d! contributes factors from 1 to d. So, for each group, the D's factors are the union of all numbers from 1 to d for each d in the counts.

So, the D is product_{d in counts} product_{i=1 to d} i.

But then, the multinomial coefficient is k! divided by this product.

So, for the multinomial coefficient, it's equivalent to (product_{i=1 to k} i) / (product_{d in counts} product_{i=1 to d} i).

But this can be rewritten as product_{i=1 to k} i divided by product_{d in counts} product_{i=1 to d} i.

Which is the same as product_{i=1 to k} i / product_{i=1 to d} i for each d in counts.

But this is the same as product_{i=1 to k} i / (product_{d in counts} d! )

So, to compute this, for each number in 1..k, we multiply it into the numerator. For each number in 1..d for each d in the counts, we divide into the denominator.

But how to do this modulo m.

This seems like the same problem as before.

But perhaps, for each group, we can precompute all the factors in the denominator and keep track of their counts. Then, when processing the numerator (1 to k), for each number, we divide out as many denominator factors as possible.

Here's an approach:

For each group:

1. Compute all the numbers in the denominator factors. For example, for each count d in the group's (x,y) pairs, add all numbers from 1 to d to a list.

2. Factorize all numbers in the denominator factors list into their prime factors. Count the total exponents for each prime.

3. Compute the product of numbers from 1 to k (numerator), and for each number, factorize it and subtract the exponents from the denominator's factors.

4. The remaining exponents in the numerator's factors (after subtracting the denominator's exponents) give the multinomial coefficient's prime factors. Multiply them all together modulo m.

But this requires factorizing all numbers in the denominator factors list, which can be up to sum of d's across all groups. For example, if a group has counts d1, d2, ..., then the denominator factors list has d1 + d2 + ... numbers, which for a group of size k is O(k) numbers. So for n=1e5, this could be up to 2e5 numbers per group, which is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Hmm. This is a tough problem.

Let's think of another angle. Since the multinomial coefficient is an integer, perhaps we can compute it mod m by first computing the numerator as k! mod (m * D), then dividing by D, then taking mod m. But how?

For example, D is the product of the denominator's factorials. Let's compute k! mod (m * D), then divide by D. Since k! is divisible by D, then (k! mod (m*D)) is equal to k! - t * m * D for some integer t. Dividing by D gives (k! / D) - t * m. Then, taking mod m gives (k! / D) mod m.

But how to compute k! mod (m*D) when D can be very large.

For example, if D is (1e5)!, then m*D is 1e5! * m, which is way too large to compute modulo.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: if m is small, then perhaps we can compute the multinomial coefficient mod m by using Lucas' theorem or other methods, but m can be up to 1e9+7, which is large.

Another possible approach is to note that the multinomial coefficient can be computed as the product of binomial coefficients. For example, the multinomial coefficient for k elements divided into groups of d1, d2, ... is equal to the product of binomial coefficients:

C(k, d1) * C(k - d1, d2) * C(k - d1 - d2, d3) * ... * C(dn, dn)

But this is again equivalent to the multinomial coefficient. So, how to compute this product modulo m.

Each binomial coefficient can be computed as C(n, k) = product_{i=1 to k} (n - k + i) / i.

But division by i modulo m can be done only if i and m are coprime.

But again, this approach would require that each denominator i is coprime with m, which is not guaranteed.

Hmm.

So, I'm stuck. Let's think of the original problem again. Maybe there's a way to avoid dealing with the denominator.

Wait, the problem requires that the x's are non-decreasing. So, the merged sequence must be a permutation of the sorted list of elements. So, the only valid sequences are those that are permutations of the sorted list, with elements ordered in a way that x's are non-decreasing. Which is equivalent to the elements being sorted by x, but with any order among elements with the same x. However, if there are multiple elements with the same x and same y, their order does not matter as they are duplicates.

But the problem statement counts two sequences as distinct if any element differs. So, even if two elements have the same x and y, but come from a and b (like two (2,1) elements from a and b), their order would not matter because they are identical. So, the number of distinct sequences for a group with such elements is (k! / (product of d! )) where d is the count of each (x,y) pair.

But if two (x,y) pairs are the same, their order in the group can be swapped, but this does not produce a new sequence. So, the multinomial coefficient is indeed the product of (k! / product d! ) for each group.

So, the crux of the problem is to compute this product modulo m.

But how to compute this when m is not prime.

Another idea: precompute the factorials modulo m, and for each group, compute the multinomial coefficient as:

(fact[k] * inv(fact[d1]) * inv(fact[d2]) * ... * inv(fact[dn])) mod m.

But this requires that fact[d] and m are coprime for each d. If not, then the inverses do not exist. So, this approach is only valid when m is prime, and fact[d] is not zero modulo m, or when m is such that all fact[d] and m are coprime.

But when m is not prime, this approach fails.

So, for example, if m is 4 and a group has k=2, and the denominator is 2, then the multinomial coefficient is 2! / 2! =1. But fact[2] mod 4 is 2, and inv(2) mod 4 does not exist. So, this approach would fail.

But in reality, the multinomial coefficient is 1, and 1 mod 4 is 1. So, the correct answer is 1.

But using the approach of fact[k] * inv(denominator), we would get 2 * inv(2) mod 4. But since inv(2) mod 4 doesn't exist, this approach gives an incorrect result.

So, this approach is invalid when the denominator and m are not coprime.

Thus, the problem requires a way to compute the multinomial coefficient modulo m even when the denominator and m are not coprime.

Hmm.

Let me think of the problem in terms of the sample inputs.

First sample:

n=1, a=[1], b=[2], m=7.

The merged list sorted by x is [ (1,1) from a, (2,1) from b ].

The group x=1 has count 1, x=2 count 1.

The product is 1! * 1! = 1 mod 7 â†’ 1.

Second sample:

n=2, a=[1,2], b=[2,3].

The merged list sorted by x is [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)].

Groups: x=1 (count 1), x=2 (count 2), x=3 (count 1).

The product is 1! * 2! * 1! = 2 mod 11 â†’ 2.

So, in these cases, the approach of multiplying factorials works.

But if there are duplicates in a group, like a group with two (2,1) elements, then the denominator would be 2! and the multinomial coefficient would be 2!/(2! ) = 1.

But if the denominator is 2! and m is even, like 4, then 2! mod 4 is 2. So, 2 / 2 mod 4 is 1, which is correct.

But how to compute this using mod arithmetic.

Wait, in this case, the multinomial coefficient is 2! / (2! ) = 1. So, 1 mod 4 is 1.

But using the approach of fact[k] * inv(denominator) mod m, where k=2 and denominator=2:

fact[2] = 2 mod 4.

inv(2) mod 4 does not exist. So, how to compute this.

But the actual result is 1. So, this approach fails.

Thus, the only way to compute this correctly is to find a way to compute the division exactly in mod m.

But how?

Another idea: since the denominator divides the numerator, the division is exact, so we can compute the multinomial coefficient as (numerator // denominator) mod m.

But how to compute this when numerator and denominator are very large.

The problem is that for large k and d, we cannot compute the numerator and denominator directly.

But perhaps, we can compute the product of the numerator and denominator factors in a way that allows exact division.

For example, for each group:

   The multinomial coefficient is (k! ) / (d1! * d2! * ... * dn! )

   We can compute this by multiplying the numbers from 1 to k, and dividing by the numbers in the denominator factorials.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let's think of it as follows:

- Create a list of all the factors in the denominator. For each d in the counts of (x,y) pairs, the denominator has factors 1, 2, ..., d. So, for a count of 2, the denominator has factors 1 and 2.

- The numerator is the product of 1, 2, ..., k.

- The denominator is the product of all factors in the denominator list.

- So, the multinomial coefficient is (product of numerator factors) divided by (product of denominator factors).

But how to compute this modulo m.

The idea is to iterate over all factors in the numerator and denominator, and for each factor in the denominator, cancel it out with a corresponding factor in the numerator.

But this requires handling large numbers, but since we are working modulo m, perhaps we can manage this.

Here's an approach:

For each group:

   1. Create a list of denominator factors. For each (x,y) count d, add 1, 2, ..., d to a list. Let's call this list D.

   2. Sort D in descending order.

   3. Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to k (the numerator factors). But during this process, divide by each element in D as much as possible.

   4. The result is the multinomial coefficient modulo m.

But how to implement this.

Let's take an example.

Group with k=2, denominator factors D = [2,1,1] (from two (x,y) pairs with counts 2 and 1).

So, multinomial coefficient is 2! / (2! *1! ) = 2/(2*1) = 1.

To compute this:

Numerator factors: 1, 2.

Denominator factors: 2, 1, 1.

Sort D in descending order: 2, 1, 1.

Multiply numerator factors and divide by denominator factors:

result = 1

Process 1 (from numerator):

result *=1 â†’ 1.

Process 2 (from numerator):

result *=2 â†’ 2.

Now process denominator factors:

Divide by 2 â†’ result becomes 1.

Divide by 1 â†’ remains 1.

Divide by 1 â†’ remains 1.

Result is 1.

Another example: k=5, denominator factors D = [3,2,2,1,1,1] (from counts 3, 2, 1).

The multinomial coefficient is 5!/(3! *2! *1! ) = 120/(6*2*1) = 10.

Denominator factors sorted: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1.

Numerator factors: 1, 2, 3, 4,5.

Process numerator factors:

result = 1

Multiply by 1 â†’ 1.

Multiply by 2 â†’ 2.

Multiply by 3 â†’ 6.

Multiply by 4 â†’ 24.

Multiply by 5 â†’ 120.

Process denominator factors:

Divide by 3 â†’ 120 /3 =40.

Divide by 2 â†’40/2=20.

Divide by 2 â†’20/2=10.

Divide by 1 â†’10/1=10.

Divide by 1 â†’10.

Divide by 1 â†’10.

Result is 10.

So, this approach works.

But how to implement this for large k and D.

The steps are:

For each group:

   Compute the list of denominator factors by adding 1..d for each count d in the group's (x,y) pairs.

   Sort the denominator factors in descending order.

   Initialize the result as 1.

   Multiply all numbers from 1 to k (the numerator factors), but for each denominator factor in the sorted list, divide the current result by that factor when possible.

But since we need to do this modulo m, which can be large, we need to perform the operations modulo m.

But division in modular arithmetic is tricky.

However, since the division is exact, we can compute the product of numerator factors and denominator factors, then perform the division as multiplication by the inverse of the denominator factors. But this again requires that the denominator factors are coprime with m.

So, this approach may not work if the denominator factors are not coprime with m.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the result by multiplying the numerator factors and dividing by the denominator factors step by step, keeping track of the result as an integer. But for large k and D, this is impossible due to integer size limitations.

But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. So, for each group, we can compute the multinomial coefficient as (factorial(k) // product of denominator factors) mod m.

But for k up to 2e5, this is feasible.

Yes! Because even though 2e5! is a huge number, Python can handle big integers, and dividing by the denominator factors (which are product of 1..d for each count d) is possible.

So, the plan is:

For each group:

1. Collect all the elements in the group.

2. For each (x,y) pair in the group, count how many times it occurs (d).

3. Compute the product of d! for each (x,y) pair in the group. This is the denominator.

4. Compute k! (k is the size of the group) divided by the denominator.

5. Compute this value modulo m.

6. Multiply this value into the overall result modulo m.

But how to compute k! // (product of d! ) modulo m.

But k! is the product of 1..k.

The denominator is product of d! for each (x,y) in the group.

So, for each group:

denominator = 1

for (x,y) in group_counts:

    d = group_counts[(x,y)]

    denominator *= factorial(d)

result_group = factorial(k) // denominator

Then, multiply result_group into the overall result modulo m.

But for k up to 2e5, this is feasible in Python.

But compute factorial(k) is O(k) time per group. For n=1e5 groups, this would be O(2e5 * 1e5) = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

No. Wait, the number of groups is not 1e5. The groups are formed based on x values. So, the total number of elements across all groups is 2n. So, for each group, k can be up to 2n, but the total sum of k's across all groups is 2n. So, for n=1e5, 2n=2e5.

So, if we compute factorials for each group, the total time would be O(2e5) per test case, which is acceptable.

But how?

Wait, for each group, we need to compute k! // (product of d! ). The product of d! is the product of the factorials of the counts of each (x,y) pair in the group.

So, for each group:

   group_size = len(group)

   counts = Counter of (x,y) pairs in the group.

   denominator = product of (math.factorial(d) for d in counts.values())

   numerator = math.factorial(group_size)

   contribution = numerator // denominator

   total_result = (total_result * contribution) % m

But math.factorial for group_size up to 2e5 is feasible. However, Python's math.factorial is optimized and can compute 2e5! quickly. But for 2e5, the factorial is a very large number, but Python can handle it.

But for group_size up to 2e5, math.factorial(group_size) would be a huge number, but since we're dividing by denominator (product of d! ), the contribution is manageable as a Python integer, but for group_size up to 2e5, this would take O(2e5) time per group. But since the sum of group_size across all groups is 2e5, the total time would be O(2e5) per test case, which is acceptable.

But even for group_size of 2e5, math.factorial would take O(2e5) time. For 2e5, this would be 2e5 operations per group. For a single group, this is acceptable, but if there are many groups, this could be O( (2e5)^2 ) time.

But the number of groups is the number of distinct x values. For example, if all elements have the same x, then there's one group. If all elements have distinct x's, then there are 2n groups. So, worst-case time is O(2e5) for groups with size 1 each. For each group, computing 1! is O(1). So, the total time would be O(2e5) for all groups.

Thus, the approach is feasible.

Let's test this approach with the first sample.

Sample 1:

Group 1: x=1 has [(1,1)].

Group 2: x=2 has [(2,1)].

Group 1's contribution is 1! / 1! = 1.

Group 2's contribution is 1! / 1! = 1.

Total result is 1 * 1 mod 7 â†’ 1.

Sample 2:

Groups:

x=1: [(1,1)] â†’ contribution 1! / 1! =1.

x=2: two elements: (2,1), (2,2). counts are each 1. So denominator is 1! * 1! = 1. contribution is 2! / 1 = 2.

x=3: [(3,2)] â†’ 1.

Total contribution: 1 * 2 * 1 = 2 mod 11 â†’ 2.

This works.

Another test case: group with two elements (2,1) and (2,1), counts are 2. So denominator is 2! â†’ 2. The multinomial coefficient is 2! / 2! = 1. So, contribution is 1.

If m is 4, this would contribute 1 mod 4 â†’ 1.

So, the approach works.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Read n.

2. Read the a and b arrays.

3. Collect all 2n elements: for each i from 0 to n-1, add (a[i], i+1) to the list, then add (b[i], i+1) to the list.

4. Sort the list by x.

5. Group the elements by x. For each group:

   a. Count the occurrences of each (x, y) pair (where y is i+1).

   b. Compute the group's contribution: (group_size! ) // (product of (count! for each (x,y) in the group)).

   c. Multiply this contribution into the total result modulo m.

6. Output the total result modulo m.

This approach is feasible in Python, even for large n.

But how to handle large factorials?

In Python, the math.factorial function can compute factorials up to 2e5 quickly. However, for group_size up to 2e5, the factorial is a very large integer, but Python can handle it. Dividing by the denominator (product of count! ), which can also be large, but Python's integer division is exact and fast.

So, the code steps are:

- Read n.

- Read a and b arrays.

- Create the list of elements: for each i in 0..n-1, append (a[i], i+1) and (b[i], i+1).

- Sort the list by x.

- Iterate through the sorted list, grouping elements by x.

- For each group:

   - Create a Counter to count occurrences of each (x, y) pair.

   - group_size is the sum of the counts.

   - Compute denominator as the product of (count! for each (x,y) in the Counter).

   - Compute numerator as math.factorial(group_size).

   - contribution = numerator // denominator

   - Multiply contribution into the result modulo m.

- Output the result modulo m.

This should work.

But what about the time and memory constraints?

Time constraints:

Sorting 2n elements: O(n log n) â†’ acceptable.

Grouping and counting: O(n) â†’ acceptable.

Computing factorials: each group's group_size is up to 2n, but the sum of group_size across all groups is 2n. So, for all groups, the total time for computing math.factorial is O(2n) â†’ acceptable.

The product of the denominator's factorials: for each group, the product of count! for counts in the group. Each count can be up to 2n. So, for a group with k elements, the product would require O(k) operations (computing count! for each count, then multiplying them). For example, in a group with k elements, if there are k different (x,y) pairs (each count is 1), then the product is 1, computed in O(k) time. So, the total time for all groups is O(2n) â†’ acceptable.

Memory: storing the list of 2n elements and the Counter for each group is manageable.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

n=1

a=[1]

b=[2]

elements are (1,1), (2,1). Sorted by x â†’ [(1,1), (2,1)].

Groups:

x=1: [(1,1)] â†’ count is 1. denominator is 1! â†’ 1. contribution 1! /1 =1.

x=2: [(2,1)] â†’ same. contribution 1! /1=1.

Total result: 1 *1 =1 mod 7 â†’ correct.

Sample 2:

n=2

a=[1,2]

b=[2,3]

elements are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). Sorted by x â†’ [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)].

Groups:

x=1: [(1,1)] â†’ contribution 1! /1! =1.

x=2: two elements. Counter is {(2,1): 1, (2,2): 1}. denominator is 1! *1! =1. contribution 2! /1 =2.

x=3: [(3,2)] â†’ contribution 1.

Total result: 1 *2 *1 =2 mod 11 â†’ correct.

Another test case where a group has two elements with the same (x,y):

For example, a group with two elements (2,1) from a and (2,1) from b.

elements: (2,1) from a and (2,1) from b.

Counter is {(2,1): 2}.

denominator is 2! â†’ 2.

contribution: 2! / 2! â†’1.

So, the code would correctly compute 1.

Thus, this approach should work.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But to handle large factorials, we can use math.factorial. Also, for the product of denominator factorials, we can compute each count's factorial and multiply them all.

But for a group where many counts exist, multiplying all their factorials may be time-consuming. But since the sum of counts across all groups is 2n, and for each count we compute a factorial and multiply, this is O(2n) time.

Thus, the code should be as follows:

Read n.

Read a list.

Read b list.

Create elements = [ (a[i], i+1) for i in range(n) ] + [ (b[i], i+1) for i in range(n) ]

Sort elements by x.

Initialize result =1.

Iterate over elements in groups with the same x:

   Use a loop to process each group.

   For each group:

      Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each (x,y) pair. However, x is the same for all elements in the group, so we can ignore x and just count y.

Wait, no. The group is already filtered by x. So within a group, all elements have the same x. So, the (x,y) pairs are (group_x, y). So, for the group's Counter, we can just count the occurrences of each y.

But for the code, when elements are sorted by x, each group has the same x. So, when processing the group, we can collect the y values and count their occurrences.

Thus, for each group:

   group_x = elements[i][0]

   group_elements = list of elements in this group (all have x=group_x)

   counts = Counter of y values in group_elements.

   group_size = len(group_elements).

   denominator = 1

   for count in counts.values():

       denominator *= math.factorial(count)

   numerator = math.factorial(group_size)

   contribution = numerator // denominator

   result = (result * contribution) % m

Thus, the code should be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys
import math
from collections import defaultdict, Counter


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline())
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))
    m = int(input_stream.readline())

    elements = []
    for i in range(n):
        elements.append( (a[i], i+1) )
    for i in range(n):
        elements.append( (b[i], i+1) )

    elements.sort()
    result = 1

    i = 0
    while i < 2*n:
        current_x = elements[i][0]
        j = i
        while j < 2*n and elements[j][0] == current_x:
            j += 1
        group = elements[i:j]
        counts = Counter(y for (x, y) in group)
        group_size = len(group)
        denominator = 1
        for c in counts.values():

Sample 2:

Input:

2

1 2

2 3

11

elements: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).

Groups:

x=1: len 1 â†’ contribution 1.

x=2: len 2 â†’ counts {1:1, 2:1} â†’ denominator 1!*1! = 1. numerator 2! = 2. contribution 2.

x=3: len 1 â†’ contribution 1. So result is 2 mod11=2.

Another test case with duplicate (x,y):

Input:

n=1

a = [2]

b = [2]

m=4.

elements: (2,1) from a and (2,1) from b.

Group x=2: two elements. counts {1:2} â†’ denominator 2! â†’ 2. numerator 2! =2. contribution 2//2=1. Result is 1 mod4=1.

Which is correct.

Thus, this code should work.

def main():

    elements = []
    for i in range(n):
        elements.append((a[i], i + 1))
        elements.append((b[i], i + 1))
    
    elements.sort()
    result = 1

            j += 1
        group = elements[i:j]
        group_size = len(group)
        counts = Counter(y for x, y in group)
        denominator = 1
        for c in counts.values():

        numerator = math.factorial(group_size)
        contribution = numerator // denominator
        result = (result * contribution) % m
        i = j
    
    print(result % m)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
