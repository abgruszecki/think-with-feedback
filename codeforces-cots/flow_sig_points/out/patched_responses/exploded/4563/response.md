<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.

So, the problem is about moving people from occupied armchairs to other armchairs such that all initially occupied chairs become free. And the goal is to find the minimal total time required to do this, considering that each move is done sequentially, and the time is the sum of the absolute differences between the original and new positions of each person. Oh, but wait, each move is done in sequence, so the total time is the sum of each individual move's time. Because each move can't start until the previous one is done. So the order in which we perform the moves affects the total time? Wait, no. Because the total time is the sum of all the individual times, regardless of the order. Because each move takes t minutes, and they are done one after another, so total is the sum. So the order doesn't matter for the total time. So the problem reduces to finding a way to assign each person (from the initially occupied chairs) to some new chairs (which are initially free), such that each new chair is unoccupied in the end, and the sum of |i-j| for each move is minimized.

Wait, but the problem statement says that in the end, all seats that were initially occupied must be free. So the people must be moved out of their original chairs. So the new chairs they move into can be any chairs that are not initially occupied, but after all moves, the original chairs are empty. But the new chairs can be any of the ones that were originally free, but during the process, perhaps multiple moves could use the same chair. Wait, no. Because once a person moves to a new chair, that chair becomes occupied. So during the process, if another person moves into the same chair, that's not allowed. Because each move is from an occupied to a free chair.

So the problem is equivalent to finding a matching between the occupied chairs and some free chairs (since the original chairs must be empty, all the people must move to other chairs). But since the number of occupied chairs (m) is at most n/2, and the number of free chairs is n - m. So m is the number of occupied chairs, and we need to assign each of them to a unique free chair, such that the sum of |i - j| is minimized.

Wait, but in the example given, the first test case:

7 chairs with 1,0,0,1,0,0,1. So the occupied chairs are positions 1,4,7. The free chairs are 2,3,5,6. So we need to assign each of the 3 occupied chairs to 3 of the 4 free chairs. But in the optimal solution, the example uses moves to 2,6,5. So the sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. That's the minimal possible.

So the problem reduces to matching each occupied chair to a free chair, such that each free chair is used exactly once (since each person must move to a distinct chair), and the sum of the distances is minimized.

So this is a bipartite matching problem where we need to find the minimum cost matching between the occupied chairs (as one set) and the free chairs (as the other set) with the cost being the distance between them.

But how do we model this?

Since each occupied chair (call them O) must be matched to a distinct free chair (F), and we want to minimize the sum of |O_i - F_j|, this is a classic assignment problem. However, the assignment problem can be solved with the Hungarian algorithm, but that's O(m^3) time, which could be acceptable if m is up to 2500 (since n can be 5000, m can be up to 2500). But 2500^3 is around 15 billion operations, which is way too slow for Python, which can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second. So that's not feasible.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem. Both O and F are sorted lists. Because the chairs are arranged in a line. So if the occupied chairs are sorted in order, and the free chairs are also sorted in order, then the minimal sum is achieved by matching the i-th occupied chair to the i-th free chair. This is because the problem is similar to matching two sorted arrays to minimize the sum of absolute differences. For example, if you have two lists of points sorted in order, the minimal sum is when you pair them in the same order.

So the optimal assignment is to sort the occupied positions and the free positions, then pair them in order. Because this way, the sum of |O_i - F_i| is minimized.

Wait, that's a key insight. Let's see the first example:

Occupied chairs are [1,4,7], sorted. Free chairs are [2,3,5,6], sorted. Then the example pairs 1→2 (distance 1), 4→5 (distance 1), 7→6 (distance 1). Sum is 3.

But according to the sorted approach, pairing the first O (1) with the first F (2), the second O (4) with the second F (3), but 4→3 is distance 1. Then third O (7) with third F (5), distance 2. Sum would be 1+1+2=4, which is worse than the example's 3. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe the sorted approach isn't correct?

Wait no, in the first example, the free chairs after sorting are 2,3,5,6. So when there are 3 O's, we need to choose 3 F's. The example uses 2,6,5. Hmm. So in the example, O is [1,4,7], F is [2,3,5,6]. The optimal is to match 1→2, 4→5,7→6. So O's sorted and F's sorted. But the F's chosen are 2,5,6, which are the first, third, and fourth in the F list. So that's not consecutive.

Wait, so maybe the sorted approach isn't sufficient. Hmm. Let's think again.

Alternatively, when you have O and F sorted, the minimal sum is achieved by matching the i-th O to the i-th F. But in the example, the O's are 1,4,7. F's are 2,3,5,6. So possible pairings:

If we take the first three F's: 2,3,5. Then O's 1,4,7. The sum is |1-2| + |4-3| + |7-5| → 1 +1 +2 =4. But the example's sum is 3. So that's worse. So that approach can't be correct.

But in the example, the optimal is O1→2, O4→5, O7→6. The sum is 1 +1 +1 =3. So here, the F's chosen are 2,5,6. So the order of O's is 1,4,7, and F's are 2,5,6, but the F's are not in the same order as O's. Wait, but F's are sorted. 2,5,6 is a subset of sorted F's.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is to sort both O and F, and then pair them in order. But in this case, the example's F's are [2,3,5,6]. O is [1,4,7]. So for m=3, the first three F's would be 2,3,5. But the example uses 2,5,6. So perhaps the sorted approach is not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the O's and F's in the same order, but this isn't possible. So maybe the problem is similar to the problem where you have to assign people to seats, and the minimal sum is achieved by pairing the i-th O to the i-th F in sorted order.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to sort both O and F, then match each O_i to F_i. But in that case, the first example's sum would be |1-2| + |4-3| + |7-5| = 1+1+2=4, which is worse than the optimal. So that can't be.

So then, why is the example's sum 3 possible? Because the example's O's are 1,4,7, and F's chosen are 2,5,6. The sum is 1+1+1=3. So the sum is better. How is this possible?

Ah, because when the O and F are sorted, but you can choose any subset of F's (exactly m of them) and pair them optimally. So the problem is to select m F's (from the available F's) such that when paired with the O's (sorted), the sum is minimized. Then, the minimal sum is achieved by choosing the subset of F's that, when sorted, can be paired in order with the sorted O's.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

- Sort the O's and F's in increasing order.

- Then, find a subset of m F's such that when both O and the selected F's are sorted, each O_i is paired with F_i, and the sum of |O_i - F_i| is minimized.

But how to choose which F's to take?

Wait, this sounds like the problem where you have a list of O's and F's (both sorted), and you need to select exactly m F's (since m is the number of O's), and arrange them in such a way that when paired with the O's, the sum is minimized.

So, perhaps dynamic programming can be used here.

Let's model the problem as follows:

Let O be the sorted list of occupied positions (size m).

Let F be the sorted list of free positions (size k, where k >= m).

We need to select m positions from F (since k >= m as per the problem statement) and assign them to the O's, such that the sum of |O_i - F_j| is minimized.

The key insight here is that for the optimal assignment, the j-th selected F must be >= the (j-1)-th selected F. So the selected F's must also be in sorted order, and they are matched in order to the sorted O's.

Thus, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of m F's (in order) and matching them to the O's (in order) such that the sum is minimized.

This is a standard dynamic programming problem. The DP state can be defined as dp[i][j], which represents the minimal total cost when considering the first i O's and the first j F's. The transition is either we select the j-th F for the i-th O (in which case we add |O_i - F_j| to dp[i-1][j-1]), or we don't select the j-th F (so dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] if j > i).

The base cases would be:

- dp[0][j] = 0 for all j >=0 (no O's, no cost)
- dp[i][0] = infinity for i >0 (can't assign if no F's are selected)
- dp[i][j] = infinity if j <i (since we need at least j >=i to select i F's)

So for each i and j >=i, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + |O_i - F_j| )

The answer is dp[m][k], where k is the total number of F's.

This approach has a time complexity of O(m * k), which is acceptable because in the worst case, m can be 2500 and k can be 5000-2500=2500. So 2500*2500=6,250,000 operations, which is manageable for Python.

So the steps are:

1. Collect the list of O and F positions.

2. Sort both O and F in increasing order.

3. Use DP to compute the minimal sum.

Let's test this approach with the first example.

Example 1:

O = [1,4,7], F = [2,3,5,6]

So m=3, k=4.

The DP table would be of size 3+1 x 4+1 = 4x5.

Initialize dp[0][j] =0.

For i=1 (O[0] =1):

j from 1 to 4.

For j=1 (F[0] =2):

dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + |1-2| =0+1=1.

j=2 (F[1]=3):

dp[1][2] = min(dp[1][1] (1), dp[0][1] (invalid since j=2 >=i=1, but dp[0][1] is 0) + |1-3|=2). So min(1, 0+2=2) → 1.

Similarly, j=3 (F=5), dp[1][3] = min(1, dp[0][2] (0) + |1-5|=4) → min(1,4) →1.

j=4: min(1, ... ) → remains 1.

For i=2 (O[1] =4):

j must be >=2.

At j=2 (F=3):

dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] (1) + |4-3|=1 → total 2.

j=3 (F=5):

dp[2][3] = min( dp[2][2] (2), dp[1][2] (1) + |4-5|=1 → 1+1=2 ). So min(2, 2) →2.

j=4 (F=6):

dp[2][4] = min( dp[2][3] (2), dp[1][3] (1) + |4-6|=2 →1+2=3). So min(2,3) →2.

For i=3 (O[2]=7):

j must be >=3.

At j=3 (F=5):

dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] (2) + |7-5|=2 →4.

j=4 (F=6):

dp[3][4] = min( dp[3][3] (4), dp[2][3] (2) + |7-6|=1 →2+1=3 ). So min(4,3) →3.

Which matches the example's answer of 3.

So the DP approach works here.

Another example: the second input.

Input: 6 chairs with 1,1,1,0,0,0. So O = [0,1,2] (assuming 0-based indices?), but wait the problem says chairs are numbered from 1 to n. So in the input, the positions are 1,2,3 (occupied). The free chairs are 4,5,6. So sorted O is [1,2,3], F is [4,5,6]. The optimal is to pair 1→4 (3), 2→6 (4), 3→5 (2) → sum 3+4+2=9. But according to the DP approach:

m=3, k=3.

For i=3, j=3, the sum would be |1-4| + |2-5| + |3-6| →3+3+3=9. Which matches the example. But the example's solution is to move 1→4 (3), 2→6 (4), then 3→5 (2) but during the process, but the sum is 3+4+1+1=9. Wait, the example's explanation says sum is 9. So the DP approach gives the correct sum.

But wait, in the example's explanation, the sum is 3 (move 1→4) +4 (2→6) +1 (4→5) +1 (3→4). Wait, that's a total of 3+4+1+1=9. So the sum according to the DP approach (3+3+3=9) is the same. So the DP approach gives the minimal possible sum. So in that case, the correct answer is 9.

So the DP approach seems to work.

So the plan is:

- Read n and a list.

- Collect O (positions where a[i] is 1), sorted.

- Collect F (positions where a[i] is 0), sorted.

- Compute m = len(O), k = len(F). Since the problem states that m <= n/2, which implies that k >= m.

- Use dynamic programming to compute the minimal sum.

Now, the DP can be implemented with a 2D array. But given that m can be up to 2500 and k up to 5000, a 2500 x 5000 array may be manageable, but in Python, using a 2D list of 2500x5000 integers would take 2500*5000=12,500,000 elements. Each element is an integer, so in Python, it's manageable. However, using a 2D array may use O(m*k) space, which for m=2500 and k=5000 is 12.5 million entries. But perhaps we can optimize space by using a 1D array and updating it in place.

Because for each i, when computing dp[i][j], we only need the previous row (dp[i-1][j-1]).

So the standard approach for space optimization is to use a 1D array and update it in reverse order.

Let me think. Let's consider the DP recurrence:

dp[i][j] = min( dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + |O[i-1] - F[j-1]| )

But since in Python, we can use a 1D array where dp[j] represents the current state for i, and we can update it in-place.

Initialize dp as a 1D array of size (k+1). Initially, for i=0, dp[j] is 0 for all j up to k.

Then, for each i from 1 to m:

   For j from i down to 1:

      if j < i: not possible (since we need to select j >=i elements?)

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see.

The idea is to iterate i from 1 to m, and for each i, iterate j from i to k.

But using a 1D array. Let's see:

Initially, dp_prev[j] represents the state for i-1.

For each j, dp_current[j] is the minimum between (if j >=i):

   dp_current[j-1] (the case where we don't take F[j-1])

   dp_prev[j-1] + |O[i-1] - F[j-1]|

So, for i-th O (0-based in O array) and j-th F (0-based in F array), but in the DP state, j is up to the current j in F.

So, we can use a 1D array. Let's see.

Initialize a DP array of size (k+1), where dp[j] represents the minimal sum for the first i O's and first j F's.

Initially, for i=0 (no O's), dp[j] =0 for all j.

For each i from 1 to m:

   Create a new array new_dp of size (k+1), initialized to a large value.

   For j from i to len(F):

      new_dp[j] = min( new_dp[j-1], dp_prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1]) )

   dp_prev = new_dp

But since in Python, creating a new array each time is expensive for large k (5000), perhaps we can use a rolling array.

Alternatively, we can process the array in reverse order, reusing the same array.

Wait, here's the approach:

We can use a 1D array where for each i, we process j from the end to the beginning.

For each i, we need to compute new_dp[j] based on new_dp[j-1] (from the same i) and dp_prev[j-1] (from i-1).

But since we can overwrite the array in reverse order, perhaps we can use a 1D array and update it in-place.

Let me think.

Let's have a 1D array dp of size (k+1).

Initially, for i=0, dp[j] =0 for all j.

For each i from 1 to m:

   For j from min(j_max, len(F)) down to i:

      if j >=i:

          if j ==i:

              dp[j] = dp[j-1] (from previous i) + |O[i-1] - F[j-1]|

              Wait, no. Because for j = i, we have to take the j-th F for the i-th O.

              Because when i=1 and j=1, we must take the first F. So for j >=i, we can have:

              dp[i][j] = min( dp[i][j-1] (if possible), dp[i-1][j-1] + cost )

              So when processing i-th O, for j in range from i to k:

                  current dp[j] (for i-1) is stored in the previous array.

                  So, in the 1D approach:

                  We need to track the previous state.

                  So perhaps, for each i, we can create a new array, but for space optimization, we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current.

So, for example:

prev = [0] * (k+1)

for each i in 1..m:

   curr = [inf] * (k+1)

   for j in i..k:

       if j <i: continue

       # curr[j] = min( curr[j-1], prev[j-1] + cost )

       # initialize curr[j] as inf

       if j >=i:

           option1 = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

           if j-1 >=i:

               option2 = curr[j-1]

           else:

               option2 = inf

           curr[j] = min(option1, option2)

   prev = curr

But perhaps a better way is:

prev is the previous state (i-1).

For the current i, we compute curr[j] for j >=i.

We can compute curr[j] as follows:

curr[j] = min( curr[j-1] (if j>i), prev[j-1] + cost )

So for j starting from i to k:

   if j ==i:

       curr[j] = prev[j-1] + cost (since there's no curr[j-1] when j=i)

   else:

       curr[j] = min( curr[j-1], prev[j-1] + cost )

So for each i, the curr array can be computed in O(k) time.

But for space, we can use two 1D arrays of size (k+1).

But since m can be up to 2500, and k up to 5000, this approach is feasible.

Now, let's code this.

So steps:

Read n.

Read the array a as a list of integers.

Collect O as the positions (1-based) where a[i] is 1.

Collect F as the positions where a[i] is 0.

Sort O and F.

m = len(O), k = len(F).

If m is zero, output 0.

Else:

Initialize prev = [0] * (k+1)

for i in 1 to m:

   curr = [inf] * (k+1)

   for j in range(i, k+1):

       if j < i:

           continue

       # j is the number of F's considered up to current.

       # in the current i-th O, we are considering the j-th F.

       # So for the j-th F (F[j-1]), we can choose to take it or not.

       # If we take it, then add |O[i-1] - F[j-1]| to prev[j-1]

       # else, curr[j-1] (but that's only possible if j>i)

       if j ==i:

           # must take F[j-1]

           curr[j] = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

       else:

           # option1: take F[j-1]

           option1 = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

           # option2: not take F[j-1], so curr[j] = curr[j-1]

           option2 = curr[j-1]

           curr[j] = min(option1, option2)

   prev = curr.copy()

The answer is prev[k]

Wait, but in the code, k is the length of F. So when j ranges from i to k, j can be up to k. Because the loop is j in range(i, k+1). Wait, no: F has indices 0 to k-1. So j represents the number of F's considered. So when j is up to k, the last F is F[k-1].

Wait, the code's j loops from i to k (inclusive). Wait, the code initializes prev as [0]*(k+1). So j can be up to k. But for j in the inner loop, when j runs from i to k (since k is len(F)), but len(F) is k. So j can be up to k. But F has indices from 0 to k-1. So when j is 1, we take F[0], j=2 → F[1], etc. So when j is up to k, the code's j is 1-based in terms of the number of F's considered. So when j is the number of F's considered, F is accessed via F[j-1].

Yes.

So in the code:

For each i from 1 to m (each O in O list):

   For j from i to len(F):

       if j <i: skip.

       etc.

So in code:

After sorting O and F, m = len(O), k = len(F).

If m is 0, output 0.

Else:

prev = [inf] * (k+1)

prev[0] =0

Wait, wait, for i=0 (no O's), prev[j] is 0 for all j >=0.

Wait, initially, prev is [0]*(k+1). Because for i=0 (no O's), the cost is 0 for any number of F's considered. So prev[j] is 0 for all j.

Then, for each i from 1 to m:

   curr array is initialized with infinity.

   for j in range(i, k+1):

       if j <i: continue (but since j starts at i, this is redundant)

       # F[j-1] is the j-th F considered (since j ranges from 1 to k)

       # for the current O[i-1]

       if j ==i:

           # can only take the j-th F (since we need to choose exactly i F's)

           curr[j] = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

       else:

           # take the j-th F: prev[j-1] + cost

           # or not take: curr[j-1] (if j>i)

           take = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

           not_take = curr[j-1]

           curr[j] = min(take, not_take)

   prev = curr.copy()

Wait, but when j starts at i and goes up to k, but in code, for the first i=1:

j starts at 1, and for each j, the code checks if j ==i (which is 1 ==1 → yes). So for j=1, curr[1] = prev[0] + cost.

Then j=2: for i=1, j=2. j is not i. So take is prev[1] (from the previous i=0) + cost. Not_take is curr[1]. Then curr[2] is min of the two.

But prev is from the previous i (i=0), which is all zeros.

So the code should correctly calculate the minimal sum.

So implementing this in Python.

Now, let's test this with the first example.

Example 1:

O = [1,4,7], sorted.

F = [2,3,5,6], sorted.

m=3, k=4.

Initialize prev = [0,0,0,0,0]

For i=1 (O[0] =1):

curr = [inf, ... ]

j runs from 1 to 4.

j=1:

prev[j-1] = prev[0] =0.

curr[1] =0 + |1-2| =1.

j=2:

take: prev[1] (prev was for i=0, j=1 →0) + |1-3|=2. →0+2=2.

not_take: curr[1] (1).

curr[2] = min(2,1) →1.

j=3:

take: prev[2] (i=0, j=2 →0) + |1-5|=4 →4.

not_take: curr[2] (1). →1.

curr[3] =1.

j=4:

take: prev[3] (0) + |1-6|=5 →5.

not_take: curr[3] (1). →1.

So curr after i=1 is [inf, 1, 1,1,1].

prev now becomes [inf,1,1,1,1].

i=2 (O[1]=4):

curr is initialized to inf.

j runs from 2 to4.

j=2:

i=2, j=2.

take: prev[1] (1) + |4-3| →1+1=2.

curr[2] =2.

j=3:

take: prev[2] (1) + |4-5|=1 →2.

not_take: curr[2] (2). So min(2,2) →2.

curr[3] =2.

j=4:

take: prev[3] (1) + |4-6|=2 →1+2=3.

not_take: curr[3] (2). →2.

so curr[4] =2.

prev now is [inf, inf, 2,2,2].

i=3 (O[2]=7):

j runs from 3 to4.

j=3:

take: prev[2] (2) + |7-5|=2 →4.

curr[3] =4.

j=4:

take: prev[3] (2) + |7-6|=1 →3.

not_take: curr[3] (4). So min(3,4) →3.

curr[4] =3.

prev now is [inf, inf, inf, 4,3].

The answer is prev[k] = prev[4] =3. Which matches the example.

So the code works.

Now, for the second example:

n=6, a = [1,1,1,0,0,0]. O is [1,2,3], F is [4,5,6]. m=3, k=3.

i=1:

j ranges from 1 to3.

j=1: take F[0]=4. cost is |1-4|=3. curr[1]=3.

j=2: min(take (0+5=5) vs curr[1]=3). So curr[2]=3.

j=3: min(take (0+6=6) vs curr[2]=3) →3.

prev after i=1: [inf,3,3,3].

i=2:

j starts at 2.

j=2: take F[1]=5. prev[j-1=1] is 3. cost |2-5|=3 →3+3=6. curr[2]=6.

j=3: take F[2]=6: prev[2] (3) + |2-6|=4 →7. not_take is curr[2]=6. min(7,6) →6. curr[3]=6.

prev now is [inf, inf,6,6].

i=3:

j starts at3.

j=3: take F[2]=6. prev[2] (6) + |3-6|=3 →9.

curr[3]=9.

prev is now [inf, inf, inf,9].

Answer is 9, which matches the example.

So the code works.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, implement this in Python, with the following steps:

Read n.

Read a as list of integers.

Collect O and F.

Sort them.

If m is zero, print 0.

Else:

Initialize prev as [0]*(k+1).

Then loop for each i from 1 to m.

In Python, for each i in range(1, m+1):

   curr = [infinity] * (k+1)

   for j in range(i, k+1):

       if j <i:

           continue

       if j ==i:

           curr[j] = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

       else:

           take = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

           not_take = curr[j-1]

           curr[j] = min(take, not_take)

   prev = curr.copy()

Finally, print prev[k].

But in Python, using lists and handling large k (5000) and m (2500) may be acceptable, but we need to handle the initial prev as [0]*(k+1), and for each i, create a new curr list.

But in Python, for m=2500 and k=5000, each curr list is 5001 elements, which is manageable.

Now, let's code this.

Edge cases:

Test case 3:

n=5, all 0. Output 0.

Another edge case: m=0 → output 0.

Another case: m=1, F has several options.

But the code should handle it.

Now, code.

We need to read the input.

In code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    O = [i+1 for i, x in enumerate(a) if x ==1]

    F = [i+1 for i, x in enumerate(a) if x ==0]

    O.sort()

    F.sort()

    m = len(O)

    k = len(F)

    if m ==0:

        print(0, file=output_stream)

    else:

        INF = float('inf')

        prev = [INF]*(k+1)

        # Initialize for i=0 (no O's), all possible j have cost 0.

        # Because when there are 0 O's, we need 0 cost.

        for j in range(k+1):

            prev[j] =0

        for i in range(1, m+1):

            curr = [INF]*(k+1)

            for j in range(i, k+1):

                if j < i:

                    continue

                if j == i:

                    # can only take F[j-1]

                    if j-1 >=0:

                        curr[j] = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

                    else:

                        curr[j] = INF

                else:

                    # option1: take F[j-1]

                    option1 = prev[j-1] + abs(O[i-1] - F[j-1])

                    # option2: not take

                    option2 = curr[j-1]

                    curr[j] = min(option1, option2)

            prev = curr

        print(prev[k], file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
6
1 1 1 0 0 0
""",
            "output": \
"""\
9
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

So the code works.

Another test case: input 6:

1 1 1 0 0 0.

O = [1,2,3], F=[4,5,6], m=3, k=3.

i=1:

j from1 to3.

j=1: prev[0] (0) + |1-4|=3 →3.

j=2: prev[1] (0) + |1-5|=4 vs curr[1] (3) →3.

j=3: prev[2] (0) + |1-6|=5 vs curr[2] (3) →3.

prev becomes [inf,3,3,3].

i=2:

j from2 to3.

j=2: prev[1] (3) + |2-5|=3 →6.

j=3: prev[2] (3) + |2-6|=4 →7 vs curr[2] (6) →6. So curr[3] is6.

prev becomes [inf, inf,6,6].

i=3:

j=3:

prev[2] (6) + |3-6|=3 →9.

prev is [inf, inf, inf,9].

Output 9. Correct.

Thus, the code works.

Now, for the third example: all zeros. m=0 → output 0.

Thus, the code is correct.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
occupied = [i + 1 for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 1]
free = [i + 1 for i, x in enumerate(a) if x == 0]
occupied.sort()
free.sort()
m = len(occupied)
k = len(free)

if m == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    INF = float('inf')
    prev = [0] * (k + 1)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        curr = [INF] * (k + 1)
        for j in range(i, k + 1):
            if j < i:
                continue
            if j == i:
                curr[j] = prev[j-1] + abs(occupied[i-1] - free[j-1])
            else:
                take = prev[j-1] + abs(occupied[i-1] - free[j-1])
                not_take = curr[j-1]
                curr[j] = min(take, not_take)
        prev = curr
    print(prev[k])
```
