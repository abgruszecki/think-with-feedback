Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the main task is to determine the minimum total cost of pushing dominoes such that all of them fall. The key here is that when a domino is pushed left or right, it can knock over others in a chain reaction, but we need to choose which dominoes to push (with the minimal cost sum) so that all are eventually knocked down.

First, let's parse the input structure. The input is given in blocks. Each block has a certain number of dominoes with their heights and original costs. Then, the sequence of dominoes is built by repeating these blocks (with their costs multiplied by some factors). So, the actual domino sequence is constructed by concatenating the blocks as specified in the sequence description. Each domino in the sequence will have a height from its original block and a cost that's the original multiplied by the given multiplier for that block in the sequence.

Once the domino sequence is built, we need to model the domino falling process. The challenge is to find a set of initially pushed dominoes (either left or right) such that all dominoes fall, and the sum of their costs is minimized.

Hmm, considering the dominoes are arranged in a line, the problem resembles interval covering. Each domino, when pushed to a direction, can knock over a certain range of dominoes. The goal is to select a set of such intervals (each with a cost) that covers the entire line of dominoes, with the minimal total cost.

But how do we model the ranges each domino can cover when pushed left or right?

Let's think about the effect of pushing a domino. If a domino at position i is pushed to the left, it will fall left, affecting all dominoes from position (i - h_i + 1) to i. Similarly, if pushed to the right, it affects dominoes from i to (i + h_i - 1). But wait, this is not exactly right. Because when a domino falls, it starts a chain reaction. For example, if domino i is pushed right, it will cover up to i + h_i - 1. But any domino in that range that's hit by domino i will also fall in the same direction. So, domino i's push can trigger domino j to fall right, which may cover a longer range. So the total coverage of a domino's push is not just its own reach, but the maximum right (or left) reach possible through the chain reaction.

But calculating that for every possible domino seems computationally expensive, especially given the constraints of m up to 1e7. So, we need an efficient way to model this.

Let me think of dynamic programming approaches. For each position, determine the minimal cost to cover up to that position, and track the furthest reach possible. Alternatively, similar to the interval covering problem, where we greedily select the interval that extends as far as possible with the minimal cost.

Wait, here's an idea. For each domino, when pushed left or right, the effective range it can cover is determined by the chain reaction. For example, pushing domino i to the right will cause dominoes to the right to fall as far as possible. Similarly for left.

So, for each domino, we can precompute the maximum reach it can cover if pushed left or right. Then, the problem reduces to selecting a set of intervals (each representing the range covered by a push) such that their union covers all dominoes, and the sum of their costs is minimized.

But how do we compute these maximum ranges efficiently?

Let's model the problem as follows. For each domino i, pushing it to the right would cover a range starting at i and extending as far as possible. Let's call R[i] the rightmost domino that will fall due to pushing i to the right. Similarly, L[i] is the leftmost domino if pushed to the left.

To compute R[i], we can use a greedy approach. For each i, R[i] is the maximum of (j + a_j - 1) for all j in the range that i can reach. So, for dominoes to the right of i, if they are hit by the current range, their own reach can extend the coverage. So, R[i] is the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[j] for all j in [i, i + a_i -1], but this might not be correct. Wait, this sounds like the standard approach used in the problem of merging intervals for maximum coverage.

Alternatively, we can compute R[i] as follows: when pushing i to the right, the dominoes from i onwards will start falling. Each domino j in this range, when falling right, will have a reach of j + a_j -1. So the maximum reach for this direction is the maximum of (j + a_j - 1) for all j in the interval covered by the initial push. But how do we compute this efficiently?

This is similar to the problem where for each position, we need to know the furthest position reachable. The standard approach here is to precompute R[i] for each i, which is the maximum of (j + a_j -1) for all j from i to R[i], recursively. This can be done in O(n) time with a single pass from right to left.

Wait, here's a way to compute R[i]. Let's process the dominoes from right to left. For each position i:

R[i] = max(i + a_i - 1, R[i+1], R[i+2], ..., R[i + a_i -1])

But this is not straightforward. Alternatively, for each i, R[i] is the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[i+1], but only if i+1 is within the initial reach of i. Wait, perhaps not. For example, if i's initial reach is up to i + a_i -1, then any domino within that range can contribute their own reach. So R[i] is the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[i+1], R[i+2], ..., R[R[i]] ?

But this seems computationally expensive for large m (up to 1e7). So, we need an O(m) approach.

Let me think again. For each domino i, when pushed to the right, the chain reaction will cover up to the maximum R[i], which is the maximum of j + a_j -1 for all j in [i, current_max], and this current_max is updated as the maximum reach. So, R[i] is the furthest right that the chain can reach starting from i. To compute R[i], we can process dominoes from right to left. For i from m down to 1:

Initially, R[i] = i + a_i -1. But if i+1 is <= R[i], then R[i] = max(R[i], R[i+1]). Because if domino i+1's R[i+1] is beyond the initial reach of i, then domino i's chain reaction would stop at R[i], but if domino i+1's R[i+1] is within the initial reach, then domino i can reach up to R[i+1]. Wait, no. Because domino i is pushed to the right, and domino i+1 is within the reach of i. So domino i+1 will also fall to the right, and thus, domino i's chain reaction can extend to R[i+1]. So, for domino i, R[i] is the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[i+1], but only if i+1 is <= i + a_i -1. So:

If i+1 > i + a_i -1 (i.e., the initial reach of i does not include i+1), then R[i] is just i + a_i -1.

Otherwise, R[i] is the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[i+1].

Wait, but domino i's reach is i + a_i -1, and domino i+1's reach is R[i+1]. So when domino i is pushed, domino i+1 will be hit (since the distance is 1, and the reach of i is at least i+1 if a_i >= 2). So domino i's chain will cause domino i+1 to fall, which can reach R[i+1]. So the total reach for domino i would be max(i + a_i -1, R[i+1]).

So, for i from m downto 1:

R[i] = i + a_i -1

if (i +1) <= R[i], then R[i] = max(R[i], R[i+1])

Similarly, for L[i], when pushed to the left:

L[i] = i - a_i + 1

if (i-1) >= L[i], then L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

But wait, for left direction. If domino i is pushed left, its reach is from i - a_i + 1 to i. Any domino in that range that's hit (like j) will fall left. Their own L[j] will be even more to the left, so the chain reaction would cover up to the minimal of their L[j]. So for L[i], processing from left to right:

For i from 1 to m:

L[i] = i - a_i + 1

if (i -1) >= L[i], then L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think of domino i being pushed left. Its initial reach is i - a_i + 1. Then, any domino j in that range (from L[i] to i) will also be pushed left, so their own L[j] can be even smaller. So the minimal possible L for i would be the minimal L[j] for all j from L[i] to i.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Hmm, perhaps for L[i], when we process dominoes from left to right, and for each i, if the previous domino (i-1) is in the reach of i (i.e., i-1 >= L[i]), then we can take the minimal between L[i] and L[i-1]. But I'm not sure. Let's take an example.

Suppose i=3, a_i=3. Then L[3] = 3-3+1=1. So if i=3 is pushed left, it can reach dominoes 1,2,3. Now, domino 2's L[2] might be even lower. So, the chain reaction would reach the minimal L[j] among j in 1..3.

So, the correct L[i] when pushed left is the minimal L[j] for all j in [L_initial_i, i], where L_initial_i is i - a_i +1. But how do we compute this efficiently for all i?

This seems tricky. For large m, we need O(m) time.

Alternative approach inspired by the right direction processing:

For right direction, processing from right to left allows us to compute R[i] as the maximum between (i + a_i -1) and R[i+1], but only if i+1 is within the initial reach. So, similarly, for left direction, perhaps processing from left to right:

For each i from 1 to m:

L[i] = i - a_i +1

if (i-1) >= L[i], then check if the previous L[i-1] is less than L[i]. If so, then set L[i] to L[i-1].

Wait, but maybe domino i-1's reach can be even further to the left. So when processing i, if i's initial reach includes i-1, then we can take the minimal between L[i] and L[i-1]. Because domino i's reach includes i-1, which when pushed left can reach even further.

So, in code:

for i from 1 to m:

    L[i] = i - a_i + 1

    if i > 1 and (i-1) >= L[i]:

        L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

This seems like O(m) time. Let's test with an example.

Example 1 from input:

After processing the input, the domino heights are [3,1,2,2,1,2,2].

So for domino 1 (a=3):

L[1] = 1 -3 +1 = -1. Since there's no i-1, so it's -1.

Domino 2 (a=1):

L[2] = 2-1 +1 = 2. Now, since i-1=1 is >= L[2] (2? 1 >=2 is false. So no change.

Domino 3 (a=2): L[3] =3-2+1=2. i-1=2. 2 >=2 is true. So check L[2] which is 2. So L[3] = min(2,2) =2.

Domino 4 (a=2): L[4] =4-2+1=3. i-1=3. 3 >=3 is true. So compare with L[3]=2. So L[4] = min(3,2)=2.

So domino 4 pushed left would reach to 2.

Hmm, but that's not correct. Because domino 4's initial reach is 3 (4-2+1=3). So domino 4 can reach domino 3. Domino 3's L is 2, which is the leftmost point. So when domino 4 is pushed left, domino 3 is hit, which can reach up to L[3]=2. So the chain would go up to 2, but domino 2's L is 2. So the entire reach is from 2 to 4. Wait, this seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the way L[i] is computed is the minimal left reach when domino i is pushed left. So, in the example above, domino 4's L[i] is 2. So pushing domino 4 left would cover up to domino 2 (since the minimal L is 2). But domino 2's a is 1, so when pushed left, it's reach is 2. So perhaps the chain stops there.

Wait, maybe the way L and R are computed for each domino is correct. For example, when you push a domino to the left, the minimal L[i] is the furthest left it can reach. So, the entire range from L[i] to i will be covered when you push domino i left.

Similarly for R[i], pushing domino i right covers from i to R[i].

So, once we have R[i] and L[i] for each domino, the problem becomes selecting a set of dominoes pushed left or right, such that their intervals (either [L[i], i] or [i, R[i]]) cover the entire [1, m] range, with minimal sum of their costs.

Each domino can be pushed left, right, or not pushed (but if not pushed, it must be covered by some other domino's interval). The cost is added only if the domino is pushed.

So the problem reduces to covering the line [1, m] with intervals from pushed dominoes, where each pushed domino contributes a cost (c_i for the direction chosen), and the sum is minimized.

Now, the key is to model this as an interval covering problem with minimal cost. The standard approach for such problems is dynamic programming. For each position i, keep track of the minimal cost to cover up to i. Then, for each possible interval that starts at i and extends to some j, update the dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i-1] + cost). But with m up to 1e7, this approach is O(m), which might be feasible if the transitions can be handled efficiently.

Alternatively, since the intervals can be large, we need a way to model the transitions more efficiently.

Another approach is to note that the optimal solution will consist of intervals that are as far-reaching as possible. So, we can use a greedy approach, selecting intervals that cover the current end and extend as far as possible with minimal cost.

But the problem here is that the intervals can overlap, and the minimal cost might require selecting certain intervals even if they don't reach the farthest.

But let's think again. Let's process the dominoes from left to right. For each position, we track the furthest right we can reach with minimal cost. When we are at position i, we need to cover up to i. So the optimal solution would be to select the interval that starts at or before the current coverage end, and extends as far as possible with the minimal cost.

But how do we track this efficiently?

Alternatively, let's use dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the minimal cost to cover up to position i. Initially, dp[0] = 0. For i from 1 to m:

dp[i] = min over all possible intervals that cover i, of (dp[s-1] + cost), where s is the start of the interval (s <=i <=e, the interval is [s, e] or [e, s]? Wait, the intervals are either [L[i], i] (left push) or [i, R[i]] (right push).

So for each domino j, if we push it left, it covers [L[j], j], so if we choose to push j left, then any position in [L[j], j] is covered, but to cover positions beyond j, we need other intervals. Similarly, pushing j right covers [j, R[j]].

So the approach is: for each domino j, when pushed left or right, it can contribute to covering some interval. The problem is to select a subset of domino pushes such that their intervals cover [1, m], and the sum of their costs is minimized.

But with m up to 1e7, and n up to 250,000, but the domino sequence is built from blocks that are repeated. So the actual domino sequences can be built by repeating blocks, but m is up to 1e7. So the code must process m up to 1e7 elements.

But considering that m can be up to 1e7, and per domino processing is O(1), the code needs to be O(m) time. So the approach must be linear.

Wait, but how do we compute L[i] and R[i] for each domino i in O(m) time?

Yes, the approach for R[i] is processing from right to left. For each i from m downto 1:

R[i] = i + a[i] - 1

if i+1 <= R[i] and i < m:

    R[i] = max(R[i], R[i+1])

Similarly for L[i], processing from left to right:

L[i] = i - a[i] + 1

if i > 1 and (i-1) >= L[i]:

    L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

But wait, perhaps this doesn't capture all possible domino effects. For example, if domino i has a reach that includes domino i+1, then the R[i] is the maximum of its own reach and R[i+1]. But what if domino i+1's R[i+1] is larger than i's initial reach? For example, domino i's a[i] is 2, so initial R[i] is i+1. Domino i+1's a[i+1] is 3, so R[i+1] is i+1+3-1 = i+3. Then, R[i] would be max(i+1, R[i+1]) = i+3.

So this seems to correctly model the chain reaction for pushing to the right.

Similarly for L[i]. For example, domino i's L[i] is i- a[i] +1. If domino i-1's L[i-1] is smaller than that, then L[i] becomes the min of the two.

So with these two arrays computed, each domino's left and right ranges are known.

Then, the problem becomes finding the minimal set of pushed dominoes such that their intervals (left or right) cover the entire [1, m], and the sum of their costs is minimal.

Now, how to model this optimally.

An approach that comes to mind is using dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the minimal cost to cover all dominoes up to position i. Then, for each i, we can look at all dominoes j whose interval (either left or right) covers i, and update dp[i] based on the earliest possible start of such intervals.

But with m up to 1e7, a standard O(m) approach is necessary.

Alternatively, since each domino's right push covers [j, R[j]], and left push covers [L[j], j], perhaps we can model the optimal intervals to cover the line.

Let's think of it in terms of intervals for right and left pushes. For right pushes, each interval starts at j and covers up to R[j]. For left pushes, each interval starts at L[j] and covers up to j.

The goal is to cover [1, m] with such intervals, selecting a subset with minimal total cost.

But how to model this efficiently.

Let's think of it as a problem where we need to cover the entire line by selecting intervals, and the cost is the sum of the selected intervals' costs.

This is the classic interval covering problem with minimum cost. The standard approach for this is dynamic programming, but with m up to 1e7, we need an O(m) approach.

In the classic problem, when the intervals are sorted by their start and end points, a greedy approach can be used. However, here the intervals are not sorted and the cost is variable, so greedy may not work.

An alternative is to model the problem with dynamic programming, but using a sliding window approach to find the minimal cost for each position.

For each position i, the optimal dp[i] can be computed as follows:

dp[i] = min ( dp[start - 1] + cost ) for all intervals that cover i, where the interval starts at start and ends at end >=i.

But with m up to 1e7, and each domino having two possible intervals (left and right), this approach is not feasible.

Alternatively, we can precompute for each position i the best possible interval that starts at or before i and extends as far as possible with minimal cost.

Wait, here's another angle. For each domino j, when pushed right, it covers up to R[j]. The cost is c_j. Similarly for left push. The idea is to select intervals that cover the entire line [1, m], possibly overlapping, but with minimal sum of their costs.

This is similar to the interval covering problem with weighted intervals. The problem is NP-hard in general, but perhaps there's a way to model it with some greedy approach if certain conditions are met.

But given the constraints, we need an O(m) solution. So perhaps there's a way to model the optimal choice by considering the furthest reach possible at each step.

Let me think of the following approach:

We process the dominoes from left to right, keeping track of the current coverage end. For each position i, if it is already covered (i <= current_end), we do nothing. Otherwise, we need to select an interval that starts before or at i, extends as far as possible, and has the minimal cost among all possible intervals that start at or before i and can cover beyond current_end.

But how do we find such intervals efficiently?

Alternatively, for each position i, the optimal way to cover up to i is to choose the interval that starts as far to the left as possible and extends as far to the right as possible, with minimal cost.

But this is vague. Let's think of dynamic programming again.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to cover up to position i. Initially, dp[0] =0. For i >=1, dp[i] = min over all dominoes j where j's interval (left or right) covers i, of (dp[s] + cost_j), where s is the start of the interval (s <=i).

But for each i, there are O(1) intervals that cover it. Wait, no. Because each domino j's right interval is [j, R[j]], and left interval is [L[j], j]. So for a particular i, there can be multiple intervals that cover it.

But considering that R[j] can be up to m, and L[j] as low as 1, this approach is not feasible for large m.

Alternative idea: for each domino j, when pushed to the right, it covers from j to R[j]. So, the best time to use this is when we need to cover from j onwards. So the cost would be added to the dp[j-1] and it would cover up to R[j]. Similarly, pushing j to the left covers from L[j] to j. So adding to dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j would cover up to j.

So, for each domino j, we can consider both options (left and right) and update the dp array accordingly.

But how to manage this efficiently.

Another approach is to precompute for each possible position, the best interval that starts at or after that position and covers the furthest.

Wait, here's a possible solution inspired by the "jumping game" problem:

We can track the farthest reach we can get for each position, along with the minimal cost to reach there.

We can have an array reach[i] that records the farthest position we can reach with minimal cost up to i.

But integrating the cost into this model is challenging.

Alternatively, we can use a priority queue to track the best intervals that can extend the coverage.

For example:

Initialize current_end = 0 and current_cost = 0.

While current_end < m:

    Find all intervals that start <= current_end +1 and have end >= current_end +1.

    Among these, select the one with the maximum end and minimal cost.

    Add its cost to current_cost, set current_end to its end.

But this approach is greedy and may not work if a higher cost interval allows covering a much larger range, leading to lower total cost. For example, paying a higher cost once to cover a large range may be cheaper than paying multiple lower costs for smaller ranges.

But the problem requires the minimal total cost, so the greedy approach of selecting the interval with the minimal cost per unit length might not work.

Hmm. So, this suggests that the problem requires dynamic programming.

But with m up to 1e7, even O(m) is manageable if each step is O(1). So, let's think of a way to model the dynamic programming with O(m) time.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimal cost to cover up to i. Initially, dp[0] =0.

For each domino j, when pushed to the right, it covers up to R[j], so for any i >= j, if j is pushed right, then the cost is added to dp[j-1] and the reach is R[j]. So, for all positions up to R[j], dp[i] can be updated to min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + cost_j).

But for j in 1..m, this would require O(m) operations, which is not feasible.

Similarly for pushing left: pushing j left covers up to j, but starts at L[j]. So, if we push j left, then we need to cover up to L[j]-1, then this push covers L[j] to j. So, the cost is added to dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j, and then all positions from L[j] to j are covered.

So, for each j, the right push and left push can be considered as two possible intervals that, when added, can update certain positions in dp.

But again, for m=1e7, this is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each j, when pushed right, the interval [j, R[j]] is covered. So, the best way to cover up to R[j] is to take dp[j-1] + cost_j. So, after processing j, we can track the maximum R[j] and the minimal cost required to reach there.

Similarly for pushing left. The interval [L[j], j] is covered. So, to cover up to j, we need to have covered up to L[j]-1, then add cost_j.

But how do we model this efficiently.

Let's think of the dominoes in the order of their positions. For each j from 1 to m:

If we push j to the right, the cost is cost_j, and the reach is R[j]. So, for this choice, the minimal cost to reach R[j] is min(dp[j-1] + cost_j, current dp[R[j]]).

Similarly, pushing j left covers up to j, but requires that up to L[j]-1 is covered. So the cost is dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j, and this would set dp[j] to min(dp[j], dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j).

But how do we compute this for all j in O(1) time per j.

Let's process j from 1 to m. For each j, we can compute the best possible dp[j] based on the two options (left and right pushes) and existing dp values.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when processing j, we can update the dp array for the intervals that j's pushes can cover.

For example:

When pushing j to the right, the interval covered is j to R[j]. So, all positions from j to R[j] can be updated to have a minimal cost of dp[j-1] + cost_j, but only if this is better than their current dp value.

But updating each position in j to R[j] would be O(R[j] - j + 1) time, which is O(m) in total for all j.

But for m=1e7, this is O(m) time, which is manageable.

But how to handle this efficiently.

Alternatively, we can track for each position i the minimal cost to reach it by keeping track of the farthest reach possible.

Let's define the current farthest reach as current_end, and the minimal cost to reach current_end as current_cost.

Initially, current_end =0, current_cost=0.

For each j from 1 to m:

If j > current_end, we need to push some domino to cover j. So, we look for the domino that can cover j and has the furthest reach.

But how to find that domino quickly.

Alternatively, for each position up to current_end, we can track the domino that provides the furthest reach beyond current_end. But this requires checking all possible dominoes in the current segment.

This seems similar to the way the optimal jump game problem is solved. In that problem, you have an array where each element represents the maximum you can jump from that position. The goal is to reach the end in the minimum steps. The optimal solution tracks the farthest you can reach, and increments steps when you pass the previous maximum.

Inspired by that, perhaps we can track for the current coverage [1..current_end], and the next possible maximum reach and the minimal cost to achieve it.

But integrating cost complicates things. We need to track not just the farthest reach, but also the cost associated with reaching there.

So, let's think of this approach:

We keep track of the current coverage (current_end) and the minimal cost to reach it (current_cost).

We also track the next_end, which is the farthest reach possible from the current coverage, and the minimal cost to reach next_end.

Initially, current_end = 0, current_cost = 0, next_end = 0, next_cost = 0.

We iterate through each position j from 1 to m:

For each j, if j exceeds current_end, we need to select the best possible interval that starts before or at current_end+1 and can reach the farthest. So, for each j in current_end+1 to next_end:

We look at all possible intervals that start <= current_end+1 and end >= current_end+1. For those intervals, we track the farthest end and the minimal cost.

But again, for large m, this approach may not be feasible.

Alternatively, during the iteration, whenever we reach a position j that is within current_end, we can collect possible intervals that start at j and extend further. Then, when current_end is reached, we select the best interval (with maximum end and minimal cost) to extend the coverage.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the greedy algorithm with dynamic programming:

We process the dominoes in order, and for each domino j, we consider two possibilities: pushing it to the left or right. For each option, we determine if it can contribute to covering beyond current_end and update the current_end and current_cost accordingly.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, for each domino j, when processed in order, we can track the following:

For pushing to the right:

The earliest position this domino can be pushed to cover is j. The earliest position that needs coverage is current_end +1. So, if j <= current_end +1, then this domino's right push can contribute to extending the coverage up to R[j]. We can keep track of the maximum R[j] among all such dominoes and the minimal cost.

Similarly, for pushing to the left:

The domino's left push covers up to j. The earliest position that needs coverage is current_end +1. But the left push covers from L[j] to j. So, if L[j] <= current_end +1 and j >= current_end +1, then this domino's left push can cover current_end +1 up to j. So, the cost is added if we push it.

But again, this seems complicated.

Perhaps the right way to model this is to use dynamic programming with the following transitions:

For each j in 1..m:

The minimal cost to cover up to R[j] (when pushed right) is dp[j-1] + cost_j.

So, for all i in [j, R[j]], dp[i] could be updated to min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + cost_j).

Similarly, for left push, the minimal cost to cover up to j is dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j.

So, for i in [L[j], j], dp[i] could be updated to min(dp[i], dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j).

But updating all i in these ranges is O(m) time, which is not feasible for m=1e7.

Hmm. So we need a way to compute these updates efficiently.

An alternative approach is to note that for the right push of j, the optimal dp for all positions up to R[j] can be updated as the minimum between their current value and dp[j-1] + cost_j. However, for large ranges, this can be represented using a segment tree with range updates. But segment trees with range updates for 1e7 elements are not feasible in Python due to memory and time constraints.

Another idea is to keep track of the earliest possible position where a new interval could start. For example, when processing j, if pushing j right can cover up to R[j], then for any position i in j to R[j], the cost could be dp[j-1] + cost_j. So, the minimal cost to reach R[j] is min(dp[R[j]], dp[j-1] + cost_j). Similarly, for left push, the cost to reach j is min(dp[j], dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j).

So, for each j, we compute these two possibilities and update the dp array accordingly.

But this way, the dp array is only updated for the endpoints, but the intermediate positions are not updated. However, perhaps this is sufficient.

For example:

When pushing j right, the interval [j, R[j]] is covered. So, after pushing j, any position up to R[j] is covered. So, the minimal cost to reach R[j] is the minimal between the current cost and dp[j-1] + cost_j.

Similarly, for positions between j and R[j], their dp values can be at least as good as the cost to reach R[j]. But since we are interested in covering up to m, perhaps we can model the dp as tracking the minimal cost to reach each position i, but in a way that allows us to propagate the updates efficiently.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's model the dp as the minimal cost to cover up to i. Then, for each i, dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1]) (if the domino i is covered by previous pushes). But this isn't correct because domino i may be covered by a previous interval.

Alternatively, once you've covered up to i, you can automatically cover up to i+1 if i+1 is already covered by existing intervals. But this is not the case, because the intervals are not contiguous.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think back to the problem.

The key is to model the minimal cost to cover up to each position, and for each domino, compute the best possible way to cover a new range based on its left and right pushes.

But with m up to 1e7, we need an O(m) solution. Let's think of the following approach:

We can precompute for each position i, the best right push that starts at i (i.e., the domino at i pushed right), which covers up to R[i]. Similarly, the best left push that covers up to i.

But how?

Alternatively, for each position i, the best right push is the one that extends as far as possible and has the minimal cost. Similarly for left pushes.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Let me think of the following dynamic programming approach:

We process the dominoes from left to right. For each position i, we track the minimal cost to cover up to i.

Initially, dp[0] =0.

For each i from 1 to m:

    dp[i] = dp[i-1]  # Assume domino i is covered by previous pushes.

    # Then, consider pushing domino i to the right or left.

    # If we push i right: the cost is cost_i + dp[i-1], and it covers up to R[i].

    # So for all positions j from i to R[i], their dp[j] can be updated to min(dp[j], cost_i + dp[i-1]).

    # But this is O(1) if we track the maximum R[i] and the minimal cost to reach there.

    # So, perhaps we can track a variable right_most, which is the furthest we can reach with a certain cost.

    if right_most < R[i] or (right_most == R[i] and current_cost > cost_i + dp[i-1]):

        right_most = R[i]

        current_cost = cost_i + dp[i-1]

    # Similarly for left push:

    # Pushing i left covers from L[i] to i. So, if L[i] <= current position, then the cost is cost_i + dp[L[i]-1]

    # So, the coverage up to i is achieved by covering up to L[i]-1, then pushing i left.

    # So, the cost for i is min(dp[i], cost_i + dp[L[i]-1])

    left_cost = cost_i + (dp[L[i]-1] if L[i] >0 else 0)

    if dp[i] > left_cost:

        dp[i] = left_cost

    # Also, after processing i, if the current right_most is >=i, then dp[i] can be min(dp[i], current_cost)

    if i <= right_most and dp[i] > current_cost:

        dp[i] = current_cost

But this is a rough idea. Let's see:

We track right_most and current_cost as the furthest reach possible with a right push, and its cost.

For each i, the right push of i may extend the right_most. So, if pushing i right gives a larger right_most than before, we update right_most and current_cost to cost_i + dp[i-1].

Then, for any i, if it's within the right_most, its dp[i] can be the current_cost (the cost to reach right_most), or the previous dp[i] (which could be from a left push or previous right pushes).

Similarly, for a left push of i, we need to check if covering up to L[i]-1 and then paying cost_i gives a better cost for i.

This way, each domino is considered for both left and right pushes, and the current right_most is tracked.

This approach would allow us to process each domino in O(1) time, resulting in O(m) total time.

Let's test this approach with the first example.

Example 1:

After processing the input, domino heights are [3,1,2,2,1,2,2], and their costs are [4,3,6,3,1,2,1].

We need to compute R and L for each domino.

Calculating R[i] (processing from right to left):

i=7: a=2 → R[7] =7+2-1=8. Since i+1=8 is beyond m=7, so R[7]=8.

i=6: a=2 → R[6] =6+2-1=7. Since i+1=7 <=7, check R[7]=8. So R[6]=max(7,8)=8.

i=5: a=1 → R[5] =5+1-1=5. i+1=6 <=5? No. So R[5]=5.

i=4: a=2 → R[4] =4+2-1=5. i+1=5 <=5. Check R[5]=5 → R[4]=5.

i=3: a=2 → R[3] =3+2-1=4. i+1=4 <=4. Check R[4]=5 → R[3]=5.

i=2: a=1 → R[2] =2+1-1=2. i+1=3 <=2? No. R[2]=2.

i=1: a=3 → R[1] =1+3-1=3. i+1=2 <=3. Check R[2]=2. So R[1] =3.

So R array is [3,2,5,5,5,8,8].

L[i] processing left to right:

i=1: a=3 → L[1] =1-3+1 =-1. i=1, no previous, so L[1]=-1.

i=2: a=1 → L[2] =2-1+1 =2. i-1=1. Is 1 >= L[2] (2)? No. So L[2]=2.

i=3: a=2 → L[3]=3-2+1=2. i-1=2 >=2 → check L[2]=2. So L[3]=min(2, 2)=2.

i=4: a=2 → L[4] =4-2+1=3. i-1=3 >=3 → check L[3]=2. So L[4] = min(3, 2)=2.

i=5: a=1 → L[5]=5-1+1=5. i-1=4 <5 → L[5]=5.

i=6: a=2 → L[6] =6-2+1=5. i-1=5 >=5 → check L[5]=5. So L[6]=min(5,5)=5.

i=7: a=2 → L[7] =7-2+1=6. i-1=6 >=6 → check L[6]=5. So L[7]=min(6,5)=5.

So L array is [-1, 2, 2, 2,5,5,5].

Now, let's compute the dp array.

Initialize dp[0] =0.

current_end =0.

current_cost =0.

right_most =0.

For i=1:

Check if i> current_end (current_end is 0). Yes. So we need to select an interval that starts at <=1. The right_most is 0, so no interval can cover 1. So we have to push a domino.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't capturing all possibilities. Let's see.

But according to this approach, for each i, we compute dp[i] as the min between:

1. dp[i-1] (if domino i is covered by previous intervals)

2. left_cost = cost_i + dp[L[i]-1] (if we push i left)

3. current_cost (if i is within right_most)

But in this example, the optimal solution is to push domino 7 left and domino 1 right.

Let's see how the dynamic programming would proceed.

Initialize dp[0] =0.

current_end =0.

current_cost =0.

right_most =0.

For i=1 to 7:

i=1:

current_end is 0. i=1 is beyond current_end. So we need to select an interval that covers i.

Option 1: push i right. R[1] =3. cost is 4.

So right_most =3. current_cost =4.

Option 2: push i left. L[i] is -1. So cost is 4 + dp[-1], but dp[-1] is undefined. Wait, L[i]-1 is -2. But since domino positions start at 1, perhaps L[i]-1 <0 is considered as 0. So cost would be 4 + dp[0] =4+0=4.

So left_cost =4.

So dp[1] = min(0 + 4 (from left), current_cost (0 if i is not covered))?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model dp[i] as the minimal cost to cover up to i.

For each i, the dp[i] can be updated from three possibilities:

1. From the previous position (dp[i-1], assuming domino i is covered by previous pushes).

But this is only possible if domino i is already covered by some interval. So, if there's an interval that covers i, then domino i is already down, and we don't need to push it.

But how do we know if domino i is covered by previous pushes.

Alternatively, the dp[i] represents the minimal cost to cover up to and including i.

So, for i=1:

The ways to cover i are:

- Push domino 1 right, covering up to 3. So cost is 4. Then, dp[3] =4.

- Push domino 1 left, covering up to 1 (since L[1] is -1, which is invalid. So perhaps the left push covers up to 1. So cost is 4. Then, dp[1] =4.

- Push domino 2 right, but domino 2 is not processed yet.

Wait, but this seems to suggest that the dynamic programming approach is not viable for this problem.

Perhaps another way to model the problem is to represent it as intervals and use a priority queue to select the best intervals.

Let's consider all possible intervals from pushing each domino to the left or right. Each interval has a start and end, and a cost.

The problem is to select a subset of these intervals that covers [1, m], with minimal total cost.

This is the classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard. However, given the special structure of the intervals (each interval is a contiguous range), there might be a greedy approach.

The greedy approach would be to select the interval that covers the current position and extends the furthest to the right, with the minimal cost per unit length. But this may not work for all cases.

Alternatively, here's a possible greedy approach inspired by the interval scheduling:

Sort all possible intervals (from left and right pushes) by their starting point. For each position, select the interval with the farthest reach and minimal cost that starts before or at the current position.

But with m up to 1e7, sorting all possible intervals is not feasible.

But considering that each domino can generate two intervals (left and right), and m is 1e7, this would generate 2e7 intervals, which is manageable. But in Python, handling 2e7 elements is possible, but time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps we can generate the intervals on the fly and track the best possible intervals for each possible starting position.

Another idea is to precompute for each position the best possible interval (in terms of farthest reach and minimal cost) that starts at or before that position.

But I'm not sure.

Another angle: since each domino's right push covers [j, R[j]] and left push covers [L[j], j], the best right pushes are those with the largest R[j] for their j. Similarly, the best left pushes are those with the smallest L[j] for their j.

But how to select between them.

Alternatively, for each position, the optimal way to cover it is to choose the minimal cost between pushing a domino to the left or right that covers it.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Let me think of the first example again.

The optimal solution is to push domino 7 left (cost 1) and domino 1 right (cost4). But according to the example's explanation, the total cost is 1+4=5.

But according to the dp approach, when processing domino 7, perhaps it's pushed left, which covers up to 5 (L[7] is 5, so the interval [5,7]). The cost is 1. So dp[7] would be dp[5-1] (dp[4]) + 1.

But if domino 4's coverage is already part of domino 1's right push, which covers up to 3, then domino 4 would have to be covered by another push.

This suggests that the dynamic programming approach must consider all possible ways to cover up to j by either pushing j left or right, or by other intervals.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows:

For each domino j, when pushed right, it covers up to R[j]. So the cost to cover up to R[j] is min(current cost to R[j], dp[j-1] + cost_j).

For each domino j, when pushed left, it covers up to j. So the cost to cover up to j is min(current cost to j, dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j).

Thus, for all j from 1 to m:

dp[R[j]] = min(dp[R[j]], dp[j-1] + cost_j)

dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j)

But to compute this efficiently, we need to process the dominoes in a way that allows these updates to be done in O(1) time per domino.

But for m=1e7, even this would be O(m) time.

But how to compute the dp array.

Initialize dp[0] =0, dp[1..m] = infinity.

For each j from 1 to m:

    if j <= m:

        # Push right
        right_end = min(R[j], m)
        if dp[j-1] + cost_j < dp[right_end]:
            dp[right_end] = dp[j-1] + cost_j

        # Push left
        left_start = L[j]
        if left_start <1:
            left_start =1
        left_cost = dp[left_start-1] + cost_j
        if left_cost < dp[j]:
            dp[j] = left_cost

    # Also, propagate the current dp[j] to the next positions if possible

    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1])

Wait, but this isn't correct. Because even if you push j to the right, you cover up to R[j]. So, after pushing j right, any position up to R[j] is covered. So, the minimal cost for any position between j and R[j] is at most dp[j-1] + cost_j.

But how to model this.

Perhaps, after processing j, for positions from j to R[j], the dp of those positions can be updated to the minimum between their current value and dp[j-1] + cost_j.

But with m=1e7, this would be O(m) in total time.

But again, this is not feasible.

An alternative approach is to track the current best coverage and cost.

Initialize current_end =0, current_cost=0.

For j from 1 to m:

    if j > current_end:

        # Need to select a push to cover j

        # Find the best possible push to cover j

        best_right = j

        best_right_end = R[j]

        best_right_cost = cost_j + current_cost

        # Also check if there's a domino to the left of j that can cover j when pushed right.

        # But this seems impossible since we process j in order.

        # So, perhaps the best is to select the domino j pushed right or left.

        # Compare pushing j right and left.

        # For right push:

        right_end = R[j]

        right_cost = current_cost + cost_j

        # For left push:

        left_end = j

        left_cost = (dp[L[j]-1] if L[j]>0 else 0) + cost_j

        # Choose the one with lower cost and larger end.

        if right_end > left_end:

            current_end = right_end

            current_cost = right_cost

        elif right_end < left_end:

            current_end = left_end

            current_cost = left_cost

        else:

            if right_cost < left_cost:

                current_end = right_end

                current_cost = right_cost

            else:

                current_end = left_end

                current_cost = left_cost

    else:

        # j is already covered, check if pushing j can extend the coverage.

        # Push right:

        if R[j] > current_end:

            potential_cost = current_cost + cost_j

            if potential_cost < current_cost:

                current_end = R[j]

                current_cost = potential_cost

        # Push left:

        # The left push covers up to j. Since j is already covered, this may not help.

        # But if L[j] < current_end, then pushing j left may cover a part that allows other dominoes to be pushed.

        # This is getting too vague.

But this approach is not correct and may miss optimal choices.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct way to proceed is to look for a way to model the problem with the R and L arrays and use dynamic programming with O(m) time.

The key insight is that for each domino j, pushing right covers up to R[j], and this can be modeled by updating the dp[R[j]] with dp[j-1] + cost_j. Similarly, pushing left covers up to j, which requires that L[j]-1 is already covered, and then the cost is dp[L[j]-1] + cost_j.

Additionally, we can track for each position i, the minimal cost up to i by propagating the minimal cost forward. For example, if we have covered up to i with cost c, then all positions up to i can be considered as covered with cost c.

So, here's the approach:

Initialize dp array of size m+1 with infinity.

dp[0] = 0.

For j from 1 to m:

    # Push right

    right_end = min(R[j], m)

    if dp[j-1] + cost_j < dp[right_end]:

        dp[right_end] = dp[j-1] + cost_j

    # Push left

    left_end = j

    left_start = L[j]

    if left_start <= 0:

        left_start = 0

    if dp[left_start] + cost_j < dp[left_end]:

        dp[left_end] = dp[left_start] + cost_j

    # Propagate the minimal cost forward

    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1])

So, after processing each domino j, we update the dp[right_end] and dp[left_end], then propagate the minimal cost forward.

The propagate step ensures that if covering up to j-1 is cheaper than j's current cost, then j's cost is updated. This represents the fact that if j is already covered by previous pushes, then no need to push j.

Let's test this approach with the first example.

Example 1:

m=7.

Dominoes (indexes 1-7):

heights: [3,1,2,2,1,2,2]

costs: [4,3,6,3,1,2,1]

R[j] for j=1-7: [3,2,5,5,5,8,8]

L[j] for j=1-7: [-1,2,2,2,5,5,5]

Initialize dp[0]=0, dp[1..7]=inf.

Processing j=1:

right_end = min(3,7)=3. dp[0] +4=4. dp[3] is inf, so set to4.

left_end=1. L[1] =-1 → left_start=0. dp[0]+4=4. dp[1] is inf, so set to4.

Propagate: dp[1] = min(4, dp[0]) =4.

dp[2] = min(inf, dp[1]=4) →4.

dp[3] = min(4, dp[2]=4) →4.

Processing j=2:

right_end=min(2,7)=2. dp[1]=4 +3=7. Current dp[2] is4. 7>4 → no change.

left_end=2. L[2]=2 → left_start=2-1=1. dp[1] is4. 4+3=7. dp[2] is4 → no change.

Propagate: dp[2] = min(4, dp[1]=4) →4.

Processing j=3:

right_end=5. dp[2] +6=4+6=10. Current dp[5] is inf → set to10.

left_end=3. L[3]=2 → left_start=2. dp[2] is4. 4+6=10. dp[3] is4 → no change.

Propagate: dp[3] =4.

Processing j=4:

right_end=5. dp[3] +3=4+3=7. Current dp[5] is10 → set to7.

left_end=4. L[4]=2. left_start=2. dp[2]=4 →4+3=7. dp[4] is4 (from propagate) →7>4 → no change.

Propagate: dp[4] =4.

Processing j=5:

right_end=5. dp[4] +1=4+1=5. Current dp[5] is7 →5<7 → set to5.

left_end=5. L[5]=5 → left_start=5-1=4. dp[4] is4 →4+1=5. dp[5] is5 → same → no change.

Propagate: dp[5] =5.

Processing j=6:

right_end=7 (since R[6]=8, min(8,7)=7). dp[5] +2=5+2=7. dp[7] is inf → set to7.

left_end=6. L[6]=5 → left_start=5. dp[5]=5 →5+2=7. dp[6] is5 →7>5 → no change.

Propagate: dp[6] =5.

Processing j=7:

right_end=7. dp[6] +1=5+1=6. dp[7] is7 →6<7 → set to6.

left_end=7. L[7]=5 → left_start=5. dp[5] is5 →5+1=6. dp[7] is6 → same → no change.

Propagate: dp[7] =6.

But the correct answer is5. So this approach gives 6, which is incorrect.

Hmm. So, what's wrong here?

In the first example, the optimal solution is to push domino 7 left (cost1) and domino 1 right (cost4), total 5.

But according to the dynamic programming approach, after processing domino 7, the cost is 6.

Let's see where the discrepancy is.

When processing j=7:

right_end=7. cost is dp[6] +1=5+1=6. So dp[7] is min(inf,6) →6.

left_end=7. L[7]=5. left_start=5. dp[5] is5. cost is5+1=6. So dp[7] is min(6,6) →6.

But the optimal solution's cost is5.

Ah, but according to the dynamic programming approach, the cost to cover up to 7 is6, but the correct answer is5. So where's the error.

The error is that the dynamic programming approach isn't considering that pushing domino7 left covers up to 7 (which is correct), but in the example, pushing domino7 left covers dominoes 5,6,7. Then, domino6 falls and covers domino5, but domino5's a is1, so it doesn't cover any further.

But according to the dynamic programming approach, the left push of domino7 requires that the coverage up to L[7]-1 is covered. L[7] is5, so L[7]-1=4. So the cost to cover up to4 must be added to the cost of pushing7 left. dp[4] is4. So cost is4+1=5. But according to the code, left_start=5, so dp[5] is5. Why?

Ah! Oh, wait. The code computes left_start as L[j] for left push. But L[j] is the leftmost position covered by domino j when pushed left, which is L[j] =5. So, to push j=7 left, the interval covered is [5,7]. So, the coverage up to L[j]-1 (5-1=4) must be covered. So the cost is dp[4] + cost_j. 

But in the code, when processing left push:

left_start = L[j] 

left_end = j 

so the code is using dp[left_start-1] + cost_j. 

For j=7, L[j] is5. So left_start-1 =5-1=4. dp[4] is4. So the cost is4+1=5. 

But in the code, when pushing left:

left_end = j 

left_start = L[j] 

left_cost = dp[left_start-1] + cost_j 

But in the code, for j=7, left_start=5, left_start-1=4. 

So, the code should compute left_cost = dp[4] +1=4+1=5. Then, dp[j=7] would be min(6 (from right push), 5 (from left push)), so dp[7] would be5. 

But in the code, the left_end is7. So, the code sets dp[left_end] = min(dp[left_end], left_cost). 

For j=7, left_end=7. 

So, during processing j=7:

The code computes left_cost = dp[4] +1=4+1=5. 

Initially, dp[7] is inf. Then, the left push sets dp[7] to5. 

Then, the right push is processed: dp[6] +1=5+1=6, so dp[7] is min(5,6) →5. 

So, after j=7 is processed, dp[7] is5, which matches the correct answer. 

But why in the earlier step-by-step processing, the code's left_start was 5 and left_start-1=4. 

Ah, the code's processing for left push is: 

left_end =j 

left_start = L[j] 

cost = dp[left_start-1] + cost_j 

So, for j=7, L[j]=5 → left_start=5. left_start-1=4. 

So, the cost is dp[4] + cost_j=4+1=5. 

So, during processing j=7, the code updates dp[7] to5. 

Then, the propagate step: after processing j=7, dp[7] is5. 

So, the final answer would be5. 

But in the earlier step-by-step walk-through, I must have made a mistake. 

Let's re-calculate the code's processing for j=7:

Processing j=7:

Push right: right_end=7. cost=dp[6] +1=5+1=6. 

So, dp[7] is min(inf,6) →6. 

Push left: left_end=7. L[j] =5. left_start-1=4. dp[4] is4. cost=4+1=5. 

So, dp[7] is min(6,5) →5. 

Then, propagate step: dp[7] = min(5, dp[6]=5) →5. 

So the final dp[7] is5, which is correct. 

The mistake in the earlier step-by-step was the code's left_start-1, which should be L[j]-1, not left_start-1. 

So the code is correct. 

This suggests that the dynamic programming approach with propagating steps is feasible. 

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

1. Read all the blocks and generate the domino sequence with their heights and costs. 

2. Compute R and L arrays. 

3. Compute dp array using the dynamic programming approach described. 

But generating the domino sequence is a challenge, especially since m can be up to 1e7. 

The input format is a bit complicated. So, the code must first read the blocks, then read the sequence of block usages, and generate the domino sequence. 

But given that m is up to 1e7, storing the entire domino sequence in memory (with heights and costs) is not feasible in Python. So, we need to generate the dominoes on the fly while computing R and L arrays. 

But R and L arrays require the domino heights, and the cost array is needed for the dynamic programming steps. 

Wait, but the R and L arrays are computed based on the domino heights. So, for each domino in the sequence, we need to know its height. 

The problem is that m can be up to 1e7, which is 10 million. In Python, storing arrays of size 1e7 is possible but may require a lot of memory. For example, an array of integers (each 4 bytes) would be 40MB for 1e7 elements, which is manageable. 

But 1e7 dominoes with height and cost would require two arrays of size 1e7 each. 

But given the memory constraints (768MB), it's possible. 

But the input is given in a way that the domino sequence is built by repeating blocks. 

So, the code needs to read the sequence of blocks and generate the domino heights and costs accordingly. 

The steps are:

Read n and m. 

Read n blocks. Each block has:

- k_i 

- k_i a_j 

- k_i c_j 

Then read q lines, each with id_i and mul_i. Each such line appends k_{id_i} dominoes to the sequence. The dominoes in the block id_i have their cost multiplied by mul_i. 

The total number of dominoes is m. 

So, to generate the domino heights and costs, we can process each of the q blocks, and for each, append the block's dominoes' heights and multiplied costs to the global list. 

But with m up to 1e7, this is feasible in Python if we use lists and pre-allocate the arrays. 

For example:

Read each block's a and c arrays and store them. 

Then, for each of the q block usages (id_i, mul_i), append the block's a and c arrays multiplied by mul_i (for the cost). 

So, the code will generate the entire list of a and c for all m dominoes. 

But wait, no. For the block's dominoes, the heights are taken as given (a_j), and the cost is c_j * mul_i. 

Yes. So, for each block usage in the sequence, the dominoes in the block are appended to the global list, with their a_j as per the block's a array, and c_j * mul_i as their cost. 

So, the code needs to generate two arrays: a (heights) and costs (c) for all m dominoes. 

Once the a and cost arrays are built, the code can compute R and L arrays. 

But generating the a and cost arrays requires reading the input blocks and building them. 

But with m up to 1e7, and Python's list handling, this can be done. 

However, the input can have q up to 250,000, and each block usage can have k_i up to 250,000. So, the code needs to process each block usage, read id_i and mul_i, then append the corresponding a and c arrays multiplied by mul_i. 

But in Python, list extensions are efficient. 

Once the a and cost arrays are built, the R and L arrays can be computed. 

For R array:

Process from m-1 downto 0 (assuming dominoes are 0-indexed or 1-indexed). 

Wait, in the code, dominoes are 1-indexed. So for i in range(m, 0, -1):

R[i] = i + a[i] -1 

if i+1 <= R[i] and i < m:

    R[i] = max(R[i], R[i+1])

For L array:

Process from 1 to m:

L[i] = i - a[i] +1 

if i >1 and i-1 >= L[i]:

    L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

Once R and L are computed, the dp array is computed as follows:

dp = [inf] * (m+1)

dp[0] =0 

for i in range(1, m+1):

    # process right push

    j =i 

    right_end = R[j]

    if right_end >m:

        right_end =m 

    if dp[j-1] + cost[j] < dp[right_end]:

        dp[right_end] = dp[j-1] + cost[j]

    # process left push

    left_end = j 

    left_start = L[j]

    if left_start <1:

        left_start =0 

    else:

        left_start -=1 

    # cost is dp[left_start] + cost[j]

    if left_start <0:

        left_cost = cost[j]

    else:

        left_cost = dp[left_start] + cost[j]

    if left_cost < dp[left_end]:

        dp[left_end] = left_cost 

    # propagate 

    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1])

Finally, the answer is dp[m]

But wait, the dp array is of size m+1. For dominoes 1..m.

But in code, the loops should be from 1 to m.

But let's confirm the indices.

Once the code has generated the a and cost arrays (1-based indexing), then R and L arrays are computed. Then, the dp array is 0-based up to m. 

But in the code, for each domino j (1-based), when pushed right, the end is R[j]. 

But when j is 1-based, the domino j's right push covers up to R[j]. 

Then, the code processes each j from 1 to m:

- Push right: dp[j-1] + cost[j] → this is the cost to cover up to j-1 plus the cost of pushing j right. 

- Push left: L[j] is the leftmost position covered, so the coverage up to L[j]-1 is required. 

So, for each j, the code processes these two possibilities. 

Then, the propagate step ensures that dp[j] is the minimal cost between the current value and dp[j-1]. 

This way, dominoes that are covered by previous pushes (without needing to be pushed) are accounted for. 

Thus, the code should correctly compute the minimal cost. 

Now, the main challenge is to read the input and generate the a and cost arrays correctly. 

But given the input constraints, this can be done as follows:

Read n and m. 

Then read n blocks:

For each block, read k_i, then the a_j list, then the c_j list. 

Store these blocks in a list, indexed by block_id (starting from 1). 

Then read q. 

Then read q lines of id_i and mul_i. 

For each line, append to the a list the block's a_j list. 

For the cost list, append the block's c_j * mul_i. 

But wait, each block's dominoes are appended in sequence. For example, if a block has k_i dominoes, then each id_i, mul_i in the sequence appends those k_i dominoes (their a and c * mul_i) to the global list. 

Thus, the code must accumulate the a and cost lists by appending the a_j and c_j * mul_i for each block in the sequence. 

But for large k_i and q, this requires efficient handling. 

In Python, list comprehensions and generators can help. 

But the code must read the input properly. 

So, the code can be structured as follows:

Read n and m. 

blocks = list of blocks. blocks[0] unused. 

for each of the n blocks:

    read k_i 

    read list of a_j 

    read list of c_j 

    append to blocks as (a_j, c_j)

Then, read q. 

a = [] 

cost = [] 

for each of the q lines:

    id_i, mul_i = map(int, input().split())

    block_a, block_c = blocks[id_i-1]

    a.extend(block_a)

    cost.extend( [c * mul_i for c in block_c] )

But with m up to 1e7, and each block's k_i up to 250,000, and q up to 250,000, this can be done efficiently. 

But in Python, extending lists with millions of elements is manageable. 

Once a and cost are built, check that their lengths are m. 

Then compute R and L arrays. 

R is computed from m downto 1. 

L is computed from 1 to m. 

Then the dp array is computed. 

But since m can be up to 1e7, the code must process this efficiently. 

In Python, using lists for R and L with m elements is possible. 

But for m=1e7, each list will take 40MB (using 4 bytes per integer), which is manageable. 

But in practice, Python lists of integers use more memory, but for 1e7 elements, it's manageable within 768MB. 

Thus, the code can proceed. 

Now, the code must be written to read the input, generate a and cost arrays, compute R and L, then compute the dp array. 

Finally, output dp[m]. 

But let's test it against the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

2 7

3

1 2 2

1 2 1

1

3

2

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

The blocks are:

Block 1: k=3, a=[1,2,2], c=[1,2,1]

Block 2: k=1, a=[3], c=[2]

The sequence is:

q=2 lines:

line 1: id_i=2, mul_i=2 → appends block 2's a ([3]) and c*2 ([2*2=4])

line 2: id_i=1, mul_i=3 → appends block 1's a ([1,2,2]) and c*3 ([1*3=3, 2*3=6, 1*3=3]

Then, line 3: id_i=2, mul_i=2 → appends block 2's a and c*2 → but wait, in the sample input, the sequence description after the two blocks is:

Then the domino sequence is described:

The first line after the blocks is q=2 (in the first sample input), but the actual input's q is 3. Let's re-examine the sample input.

Wait, in the first sample input provided:

Input:

2 7

3

1 2 2

1 2 1

1

3

2

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

Wait, the first line after the blocks is q=3. 

The sample input is:

2 7

3

1 2 2

1 2 1

1

3

2

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

So the blocks are:

Block 1: k_i=3, a_j = [1,2,2], c_j = [1,2,1]

Block 2: k_i=1, a_j = [3], c_j = [2]

Then, the sequence description is:

q=3.

Then the next 3 lines are:

2 2 → id_i=2, mul_i=2: block 2's dominoes (k_i=1) are added. So a becomes [3], cost becomes [2*2=4]

1 3 → id_i=1, mul_i=3: block1's dominoes (k_i=3) are added. So a appends [1,2,2], cost appends [1*3=3, 2*3=6, 1*3=3]

2 1 → id_i=2, mul_i=1: block2's dominoes (k_i=1) are added. So a appends [3], cost appends [2*1=2]

So the total a array is [3,1,2,2,3], but wait, wait, the sum of k_id_i must be m=7. Let's see:

The sequence has 3 lines:

- id=2, k=1 → contributes 1 domino.

- id=1, k=3 → contributes 3 dominoes.

- id=2, k=1 → contributes 1 domino.

Total 1+3+1=5, but m is7. So this must be a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the sample input is different. Let's recheck.

The first sample input:

The input provided in the problem description is:

2 7

3

1 2 2

1 2 1

1

3

2

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

So, n=2, m=7.

Then, block 1:

k_i=3

a_j: 1 2 2

c_j: 1 2 1

block 2:

k_i=1

a_j:3

c_j:3

Then, the sequence description:

q=3.

Then, the three lines:

2 2 → block 2, mul 2: 1 domino.

1 3 → block 1, mul 3: 3 dominoes.

2 1 → block 2, mul 1: 1 domino.

Total 1+3+1=5 dominoes. But m=7. So this can't be. 

Ah, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the sample input is presented. But according to the problem statement, the first sample's input leads to 7 dominoes. 

Wait, perhaps the sample input's sequence description is:

After the two blocks, the sequence description is:

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

Which is q=3. Then, the three lines:

2 2 → block 2, mul 2: 1 domino.

1 3 → block 1, mul 3: 3 dominoes.

1 1 → block 1, mul 1: 3 dominoes.

Total 1+3+3=7. 

Ah, this makes sense. 

So the three lines in the sequence are:

2 2 → 1 domino.

1 3 →3 dominoes.

1 1 →3 dominoes.

Total 1+3+3=7. 

So, the a array for the sequence is:

block 2's a: [3] → 1 domino.

block1's a: [1,2,2] →3 dominoes.

block1's a: [1,2,2] →3 dominoes.

Thus, the a array is:

3, 1,2,2, 1,2,2 → total 7 dominoes.

Similarly for the cost array:

block 2's cost is [3 *2=6]?

Wait, no. The block 2's c_j is 2 (from the third line of block 2's description). 

Wait, block 2's description:

The third line of the block's description is 3 (c_j for the single domino in block 2 is 3). 

So block 2's c_j is [3].

When the sequence line is 2 2, the cost is 3 *2 =6. 

The sequence line 1 3: block1's c_j are [1,2,1], multiplied by 3 → [3,6,3].

The sequence line 1 1: block1's c_j are [1,2,1], multiplied by 1 → [1,2,1].

So the cost array is:

6,3,6,3,1,2,1 → sum of these is6+3+6+3+1+2+1=22.

But according to the sample explanation, the cost is 5, which is achieved by pushing domino7 (cost1) and domino1 (cost4). 

Wait, domino1's cost is the first element of the cost array. 

But the first domino in the sequence is from the first block usage (block2, mul2), which has cost3*2=6. 

Hmm, this suggests a discrepancy. 

But according to the sample explanation, the dominoes have costs [4,3,6,3,1,2,1]. 

Wait, how is this achieved?

Let me re-examine the sample input:

The first block (block1) has k=3, a=[1,2,2], c=[1,2,1].

Second block (block2) has k=1, a=[3], c=3.

The sequence is:

3 lines:

Line 1: id=2, mul=2 → block2's a is [3], cost is 3 *2=6 → domino1.

Line 2: id=1, mul=3 → block1's a is [1,2,2], cost is [1*3, 2*3, 1*3] → [3,6,3] → dominoes2-4.

Line 3: id=1, mul=1 → block1's a is [1,2,2], cost is [1*1, 2*1, 1*1] → [1,2,1] → dominoes5-7.

So, the cost array is [6,3,6,3,1,2,1].

Domino1's cost is6, domino7's cost is1.

The sample explanation says to push domino7 (cost1) and domino1 (cost4). But according to this, domino1's cost is6. 

So there's a contradiction. 

But according to the sample explanation:

The dominoes' costs are [4,3,6,3,1,2,1]. 

So this suggests that the first domino's cost is4. 

So perhaps I made a mistake in processing the sequence. 

Ah, the problem's sample input's sequence is:

The input for the first sample is:

2 7

3

1 2 2

1 2 1

1

3

2

3

2 2

1 3

1 1

Wait, let's parse it correctly.

n=2, m=7.

Block 1:

k_i=3.

a_j:1 2 2.

c_j:1 2 1.

Block 2:

k_i=1.

a_j:3.

c_j:3.

Then, the sequence has q=3 lines:

Line 1: id=2, mul=2.

Line 2: id=1, mul=3.

Line 3: id=1, mul=1.

So:

Line1: block2, mul=2 → a_j is3, cost is3*2=6 → domino1.

Line2: block1, mul=3 → a_j are1,2,2 → costs are1*3=3, 2*3=6, 1*3=3 → dominoes2-4.

Line3: block1, mul=1 → a_j are1,2,2 → costs are1*1=1, 2*1=2, 1*1=1 → dominoes5-7.

So cost array is [6,3,6,3,1,2,1].

But sample explanation says domino1's cost is4. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the way the sequence is parsed. 

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the block's c_j for block2. 

In the first sample input, the third line of block2's description is '2'? 

Wait, the sample input's block2 is:

After block1, block2 is:

1

3

2

So, block2 has k_i=1.

Second line (heights):3.

Third line (costs):2.

So, block2's c_j is 2, not3. 

Ah! So block2's c_j is2. 

Then, the sequence line1: id=2, mul=2 → cost is2*2=4. 

So, the cost array becomes:

4 (from block2, mul=2), 

3,6,3 (block1, mul=3),

1,2,1 (block1, mul=1).

So cost array is [4,3,6,3,1,2,1], which matches the sample explanation. 

Yes. 

So, the code must read the third line of each block's description as the c_j list. 

Thus, for block2:

k_i=1.

Second line:3 → a_j=3.

Third line:2 → c_j=2.

So, when the sequence has line id=2, mul=2 → cost is2*2=4. 

Thus, the code must correctly read the blocks' a and c lists. 

This explains the sample input's cost array. 

Thus, the code must correctly read the input blocks and their c_j lists. 

Thus, the code's structure is correct. 

Now, putting it all together, the code reads the input blocks, builds the a and cost arrays, computes R and L arrays, then uses dynamic programming to compute the minimal cost. 

The code must handle 1-based indices for the dominoes. 

Now, the code:

Read n and m. 

Read n blocks, each with k_i, a_j list, c_j list. 

Read q, then read q lines of (id_i, mul_i). 

For each line, append the a_j from the block and c_j * mul_i. 

Once a and cost are built, compute R and L. 

Compute R from m downto 1:

R = [0]*(m+2) 

for i in range(m, 0, -1):

    R[i] = i + a[i-1] -1 

    if i < m and R[i] >=i+1:

        R[i] = max(R[i], R[i+1])

Compute L from 1 to m:

L = [0]*(m+2)

for i in range(1, m+1):

    L[i] = i - a[i-1] +1 

    if i >1 and (i-1) >= L[i]:

        L[i] = min(L[i], L[i-1])

Then compute dp array:

inf = float('inf')

dp = [inf]*(m+1)

dp[0] =0 

for j in range(1, m+1):

    # j is 1-based

    # Push right

    current_cost = dp[j-1] + cost[j-1] 

    right_end = R[j]

    if right_end > m:

        right_end = m 

    if current_cost < dp[right_end]:

        dp[right_end] = current_cost 

    # Push left

    left_end = j 

    left_start = L[j]

    if left_start <1:

        left_cost = cost[j-1]

    else:

        left_cost = dp[left_start-1] + cost[j-1]

    if left_cost < dp[left_end]:

        dp[left_end] = left_cost 

    # Propagate

    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1])

print(dp[m])

But wait, the a and cost arrays are 0-based in the code. For example, a[i-1] is the height of the j-th domino (1-based). 

Yes, because the code appends the dominoes to a list, which is 0-based. So for j=1, a[0] is its height. 

Thus, the code is correct.

Sample input 2:

1 1

1

1

100000

1

1 100000

This domino's a is1, cost is100000*100000=10^10. 

R[1] =1+1-1=1. 

L[1] =1-1+1=1. 

When processing j=1:

Push right: cost is dp[0]+1e10 =1e10. right_end=1. dp[1] is set to1e10. 

Push left: left_start=1. left_cost = dp[0] +1e10 =1e10. 

dp[1] is min(1e10, 1e10) →1e10. 

Propagate: dp[1] is1e10. 

Thus, output1e10. 

Which matches the sample. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

Now, the code must be written with these steps, handling large input efficiently. 

Now, the code:

Read the input blocks and generate a and cost arrays. 

Then compute R and L. 

Then compute dp. 

But in Python, for m=1e7, the code needs to process 1e7 steps, which may be slow. 

But given the time limit is 2 seconds, and Python can handle about 1e6 operations per second, 1e7 steps may be too slow. 

But the code has to be optimized. 

But the problem allows for that. 

But in the code, the for loop for computing R and L is O(m). 

The dynamic programming loop is O(m). 

Thus, for m=1e7, the code has three O(m) loops. 

In Python, this may be challenging. 

But given the problem's constraints, it's the best possible approach. 

Thus, the code is as follows.
