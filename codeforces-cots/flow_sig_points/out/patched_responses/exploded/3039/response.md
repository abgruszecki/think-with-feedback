Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of letters Nastya can remove from the word t, such that after removing those letters, there's still a way for Sergey to remove some more letters (in the order specified) to get the word p. So, we need to find the largest k where, after removing the first k elements from the permutation a, the remaining letters in t can form p by possibly removing some more letters according to the permutation order.

Hmm. The key is that after selecting a certain k (number of letters Nastya removes), we need to check if the remaining letters (those not removed in the first k steps) can form p by deleting some of them. But how do we model this efficiently?

Wait, the permutation a gives the order in which letters are removed. So, the first k elements in a are the indices of the letters that Nastya removes. Then, the remaining letters are t with those k positions removed. But the remaining letters must contain p as a subsequence, but not by any order—specifically, the remaining letters must be such that p can be formed by deleting some letters in the order specified by the permutation a after the first k steps.

Wait, no. The permutation a is the order of removal. Each step, the next element in a is the index (original index of the word t) that gets removed. So, after k steps, the letters that remain are all letters of t except the first k entries in the permutation a. So, the remaining letters are t with the first k elements of a removed.

But how do we check if p is a subsequence of this remaining string?

Because, after removing those k letters, the remaining letters must have p as a subsequence, but the order of the letters is preserved as in the original t. Because when you remove letters in the permutation order, the remaining letters are in their original order except for the removed ones. So, the remaining letters are the original letters of t, minus the first k elements of a. The order is preserved.

So, to check if p is a subsequence of the remaining letters.

The problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that the letters of t not removed in the first k steps of a form a string that contains p as a subsequence. And since the permutation a is given, the order in which letters are removed is fixed.

So, the approach is to binary search on k. Because the larger the k, the more letters are removed, which might make it harder for p to be a subsequence. So the answer is the maximum k where the check passes.

Yes, binary search. The possible range for k is from 0 to len(t) - len(p) (since we need at least len(p) letters left). Wait, but len(t) - len(p) is the maximum possible number of letters that can be removed in total. Because you can't remove more than that, else the remaining letters would be less than len(p).

But since the problem states that it's possible to get p by removing letters, we know that the maximum possible k can't be larger than len(t) - len(p), but perhaps even less, depending on the order of removal.

So, binary search over k. For each candidate k, we need to check if the remaining string (after removing the first k elements in a) contains p as a subsequence.

The question is, how to perform this check efficiently for large k (like 2e5 elements).

But with binary search, the number of checks is logarithmic. For each check, we need to find if p is a subsequence of the string t minus the first k elements in a.

But how to represent the remaining string efficiently? Storing the remaining string as a list for each check is O(n) time per check, which would be O(n log n) total time. For n=2e5, that's 2e5 * 20 = 4e6 operations, which should be manageable.

But how to represent the remaining letters. Let's think: For a given k, the letters that are removed are the first k elements in a. So, the remaining letters are all the letters in t except those first k elements. So, to check if p is a subsequence, we can iterate through the original t string, skipping the first k elements in a.

Wait, but the order of the remaining letters is the same as in the original t. So, the indices that are not in the first k elements of a are kept, and their order is preserved.

So, for example, the original t is "abcde", and a is [3,1,5,2,4]. After k=2 steps, the removed letters are indices 3 and 1. The remaining letters are a, c, d, e (original indices 2,4,5), but in the original order, which would be 'a' (index 2?), wait no. Wait, the permutation a is a list of indices (assuming 1-based?) So, in the example, the permutation is 3,1,5,2,4. For k=2, the first two elements are 3 and 1. So the remaining indices are those not in {3,1}. So for the original string t, the remaining characters are the ones at positions 2,4,5 (assuming 1-based). So the remaining string is t[2], t[4], t[5], in that order.

Wait, the original order of the letters is preserved. So when we remove letters in the order specified by a, each removal is done on the current string. But the permutation is of the original indices. So, after some letters are removed, the remaining letters' positions are their original indices. For example, removing index 3 from the original string would leave the other letters in their original positions (indices 1,2,4,5, etc. if the original was length 5). So, the permutation a is a list of the original indices. So, the first k elements in a are the original indices that are removed. So the remaining letters are all indices not in the first k elements of a, in their original order.

So, for the binary search step, given a k, we can create a set of the first k elements in a. Then, iterate through the original t, and collect the characters whose indices (1-based) are not in that set. Then, check if this sequence contains p as a subsequence.

But for large k, say k=2e5, creating a set for each k would be O(k) time, which is O(n) per check, leading to O(n log n) time. But n is 2e5, so 2e5 * log2(2e5) ~ 2e5 * 18 ≈ 3.6e6 operations. Which is acceptable.

But for even larger n, but 2e5 is manageable.

But how to optimize this? Well, for each check, the first k elements of a form a set. For a binary search step with k, we can collect the first k elements as a set, then check if p is a subsequence.

But creating the set each time is O(k). For k up to 2e5, and log2(2e5) steps, this would be O(2e5 * 18) ≈ 3.6e6 operations, which is manageable.

Alternatively, precompute a prefix array. For each index i, we can have a set containing the first i elements of a. But this would require O(n^2) space, which is not feasible.

So the straightforward approach is to, for each k in binary search, collect the first k elements of a into a set, then iterate through t's characters, and collect those not in the set, then check if that list is a supersequence of p.

But for large k, this is O(n) time per check. Let's think: for each binary search step, the time is O(k + n), since building the set is O(k), and iterating through t is O(n). So for k up to 2e5, each check would be O(2e5) time, but multiplied by log n steps.

But 2e5 * 20 steps is 4e6, which should be acceptable.

Wait, no. For each check, the steps are:

1. Create a set S with the first k elements of a. This is O(k) time.

2. Iterate through the original t's characters (n steps), and collect those whose indices (1-based) are not in S. For each character, check if it's in S (which is O(1) for a set). So this is O(n) time.

3. Check if the collected list is a supersequence of p, which is O(m) time where m is the length of p (up to 2e5). But since p is given, m can be up to 2e5.

So for each check, the total time is O(k + n + m). Since k can be up to n (like 2e5), this is O(n) per check. So with binary search steps (log n), the total time is O(n log n), which for n=2e5 is 2e5 * 20 = 4e6 operations. That's acceptable.

But can we optimize this? Let's think.

Alternative approach: precompute for each index in a, the order of removal. For each position i in the original t, we can note the step at which it was removed. For example, for the permutation a, which is a list of indices, a[0] is the first index removed, a[1] is the second, etc. So for each position in t, we can create an array removed_at_step, where removed_at_step[i] is the step (index in a) when this position is removed. So for position j in t, if j is a[k], then removed_at_step[j-1] = k (since a is 1-based, j ranges from 1 to len(t)).

Wait, because the permutation a is a list of 1-based indices. So for example, if a = [3,1,5], then the first step is to remove index 3 (original 1-based), which is the third character in t (since Python is 0-based). So the array removed_at_step can be built as follows: for each index in a, in order, their step is their position in a. So for i in 0 to len(a)-1, the position a[i] is removed at step i+1 (since in the permutation a, each entry is the position removed in order). Wait, but steps start at 1? No, the first element of a is the first step (step 0, if 0-based). Wait, the steps are 0-based in the permutation a. So for the permutation a, the first k elements are the first k steps. So for each position j in t, removed_step[j] is the index in a where j is present. For example, if j is a[5], then it's removed at step 5 (if we start counting from 0). So for each j in 1-based t, we can create an array where for j, removed_step is the position in a where j appears. So we can build a dictionary or array for this.

Once we have this, then for a given k, the set of removed indices is all j where removed_step[j] < k. Wait, no. Because the permutation a is a list of the order in which indices are removed. The first k elements of a are the indices that are removed in the first k steps. So, the indices removed in the first k steps are a[0], a[1], ..., a[k-1]. So any j in t is in the remaining string only if it's not in the first k elements of a.

So for each j in 1-based index of t, we can precompute for each j the step in which it was removed. For example, for a permutation a, for each element in a, which is a 1-based index of t, the step is the position in the permutation. So for j in t's indices (1-based), we can create an array removed_step where removed_step[j] is the index i in a where a[i] == j. So for example, if j is a[3], then removed_step[j] = 3. Then, when checking for a given k, a j is not removed if removed_step[j] >= k. So, the remaining string consists of all j in t where removed_step[j] >= k.

Wait, no. The first k steps in the permutation are the first k elements. So any j in a[0..k-1] are the ones removed. So for j in t, if j is in the first k elements of a, then it's removed. So for a given k, the set S is {a[0], a[1], ..., a[k-1]}.

But building this set for each k is O(k) time. But if we precompute the removed_step array, then for any j in t, to check if it's in the first k steps, we can check if removed_step[j] < k.

Because if j is in a[i], then removed_step[j] = i. So, for a given k, j is removed if i < k.

So, with the removed_step array precomputed, for any j in t (0-based?), we can check in O(1) time whether it was removed in the first k steps.

So, the steps would be:

1. Precompute removed_step array for each position in t. For example, for each j in 1-based indices of t, find the index i in a where a[i] == j. Then, removed_step[j-1] = i (since in Python, strings are 0-based, but the permutation a is 1-based).

2. For a candidate k, when checking, iterate through each character in t's original order. For each character at 0-based index idx (original t's index), check if its 1-based index (idx+1) has a removed_step < k. If not, the character is part of the remaining string.

So, during the check for a given k, we can iterate through the original t, and for each character, check if its 1-based index is in the first k elements of a. But with the removed_step array, this check is O(1) per character.

So, the check process is O(n) time for each binary search step. But building the removed_step array is O(n) time once, which is manageable.

So, the steps to solve the problem:

- Read t, p, and the permutation a (as a list of integers, 1-based).

- Precompute the removed_step array. For each j in 1-based indices of t, find where j is in a. For example, create a dictionary or array where for each j, we store the index in a where j occurs. For example, removed_step[j] = position in a.

Wait, the permutation a is a list of 1-based indices. So, for example, a = [3, 1, 5, ...], which means that the first step is to remove the 3rd character (original index 2 in 0-based), then the first character (0-based 0), then the fifth (0-based 4), etc.

Wait, but when we process the permutation a, each element is the 1-based index of the original t. So for example, the first element in a is the index (1-based) of the first character to remove.

So, to precompute for each 1-based index j, the step at which it is removed (i.e., the index in the a list where j appears), we can create an array of size len(t), where for each j (1-based), removed_step[j-1] is the index i in a where a[i] == j.

So, for example:

a = [5,3,4,1,7,6,2] (from the first sample input). For j=5 (1-based), it's the first element in a, so removed_step[4] = 0 (since a[0] is 5). For j=3 (1-based), a[1] is 3, so removed_step[2] = 1, etc.

This array can be built by iterating through the permutation a once. For each index i in 0-based a, the value is a[i] (1-based j), so for j = a[i], we set removed_step[j-1] = i.

Yes.

So, once we have this array, for any k, the indices in t that are not removed are those where removed_step[j] >= k.

So, during the check for a given k, the remaining string is the characters in t where their 1-based index is not in the first k elements of a. Equivalently, for each character in t (0-based idx), j = idx+1. If removed_step[j-1] >= k, then it's part of the remaining string.

Wait, no. For j in t's 1-based indices, if j is in the first k elements of a, then it's removed. So, for a given j, if the step when it's removed (i.e., removed_step[j-1]) is less than k, then it's removed. Otherwise, it remains.

So, the remaining characters are those where removed_step[j-1] >=k.

So, for each character in t (0-based idx), we check if removed_step[idx] >= k. Because j is idx+1 (1-based), and j-1 is idx.

Wait, for 0-based idx in t, the 1-based j is idx+1. So the removed_step array is of size len(t), and for idx in 0..len(t)-1, removed_step[idx] is the step (i.e., the index in a) where j (idx+1) was found.

So, for example, for idx=0 (0-based), j=1. So if in a, j=1 is at position i, then removed_step[0] = i.

So, during the check for a given k, when we iterate through t's characters (0-based idx), we check if removed_step[idx] >= k. If yes, the character is part of the remaining string.

So, the check process for a given k is:

Initialize a pointer for p (m = len(p)), say ptr = 0.

Iterate through each character in t in order:

   if removed_step[idx] >=k:

      if t[idx] == p[ptr], then ptr +=1.

      if ptr == m, break and return True.

If after all characters, ptr is m, then return True.

Else, return False.

This is O(n) time per check, and with binary search steps, O(n log n) time overall.

So the steps are:

- Precompute the removed_step array.

- Binary search for the maximum k between low=0 and high= len(a) (which is len(t)), such that after removing the first k elements of a, the remaining string contains p as a subsequence.

Wait, but the maximum possible k is len(t) - len(p), because we need at least len(p) letters left.

Wait, no. Because even if you have len(p) letters left, but they are not in the correct order, it's not a solution. But the problem states that it is possible to reach p by removing letters according to the permutation. So the maximum possible k is such that the remaining letters can form p. The binary search must find the largest k where the check is true.

But binary search can be done between low=0 and high= len(a) (len(t)), since len(a) is len(t). But the actual maximum k is up to len(t) - len(p), but perhaps even higher in some cases? No, because if you remove len(t) - len(p) + 1 letters, then you have len(p) -1 letters left, which can't form p. So the maximum possible k is len(t) - len(p). So the upper bound for binary search is len(t) - len(p).

But to confirm: the binary search for k should have the initial high as len(a) - len(p) ? Because len(a) is len(t), since a is a permutation of len(t) elements.

Wait, len(a) is len(t), because the permutation is a list of all indices of t. So, for example, len(t) = n, then len(a) =n. So the maximum possible k is n - m, where m is len(p). Because after removing k letters, the remaining is n -k letters. To form p, which has m letters, n -k must be >= m. So k <= n -m.

So the initial high for binary search can be set to n -m, and low to 0.

This will narrow down the possible k's to a smaller range, reducing the number of steps.

So, the binary search will be from low=0 to high = (n - m), and find the maximum k in this range where the check passes.

Now, how to implement this in code.

First, read the inputs:

t = input().strip()

p = input().strip()

a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # 1-based indices.

n = len(t)

m = len(p)

We need to precompute the removed_step array.

removed_step = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

    j = a[i]  # j is the 1-based index.

    # the step when j is removed is i.

    # since in a, the first step is i=0 (0-based).

    # j is 1-based, so the 0-based index is j-1.

    removed_step[j-1] = i

Then, perform binary search.

low = 0

high = n - m

ans = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    # check if after removing first mid elements of a, the remaining contains p as subsequence.

    ptr = 0

    for idx in range(n):

        # check if current idx (0-based) is in the remaining.

        # current idx's 1-based is idx+1.

        # check if removed_step[idx] >= mid.

        if removed_step[idx] >= mid:

            # this character is present.

            if ptr < m and t[idx] == p[ptr]:

                ptr +=1

    if ptr == m:

        # possible to have mid, try higher.

        ans = mid

        low = mid + 1

    else:

        high = mid -1

print(ans)

Yes. This should work.

Now, considering the time constraints. For n=2e5, each binary step is O(n) time. Log2(2e5) is about 18 steps. So total time is 2e5 *18=3.6e6 operations, which is acceptable.

Memory-wise, the removed_step array is O(n), which is acceptable.

So the code is correct and efficient.
