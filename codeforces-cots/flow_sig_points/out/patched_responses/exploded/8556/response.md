<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to arrange some bracket sequences in such a way that the concatenated string has the maximum number of non-empty prefixes that are regular bracket sequences (RBS). Let's think through the approach.

First, I should understand what a regular bracket sequence (RBS) prefix means. For a prefix to be RBS, the number of opening brackets must equal the closing brackets, and at no point in the prefix should the number of closing brackets exceed the opening ones. So, each valid prefix is a complete RBS.

The key here is to arrange the given sequences in an order that maximizes these valid prefixes. Let's think about how each sequence contributes to the balance of the total string.

Each bracket sequence can be characterized by two things: its balance (the difference between the number of '(' and ')') and its minimum balance (the lowest point the balance reaches while processing the string). For example, a sequence like "())" has a balance of -1 (since 2 closing and 1 opening), and the minimum balance is -1.

When concatenating sequences, the order matters because each sequence's effect on the current balance and the minimum balance along the way affects whether subsequent sequences can contribute to valid prefixes.

Let's break it down. For a sequence to be part of a valid prefix, the cumulative balance after adding that sequence must be non-negative at all steps, and the total balance must be zero for the entire prefix.

But how does this apply when combining multiple sequences? Let's think about the sequences as either "positive" (balance >=0) or "negative" (balance <0). But even sequences with positive balance can have a negative minimum balance, which would affect the overall.

The problem reminds me of the classical problem where you need to arrange brackets to form a valid sequence, but here it's about prefixes. So maybe the approach is similar.

An important observation: when arranging sequences, the order in which we place sequences with positive and negative balances matters. For sequences that have a positive balance (more '(' than ')'), they can contribute to the total balance. But sequences that have a negative balance (more ')') need to be placed in a way that the existing balance can handle their deficit.

Let me think of each sequence as having:

- total = balance (number of '(' minus number of ')')
- min_balance = the minimum balance encountered while processing the sequence.

For a sequence to be added after the current state, the current balance plus the sequence's min_balance must be >= 0. Otherwise, during processing this sequence, the balance would dip below zero, making all subsequent prefixes invalid until that point.

So, the arrangement of sequences must ensure that the cumulative balance after adding each sequence never drops below zero. Also, the order of sequences that contribute positively and those that contribute negatively should be optimized.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to:

1. Separate sequences into two groups: those with a non-negative total balance (total >= 0) and those with a negative total balance (total <0).

2. For sequences with non-negative total balance, arrange them in a way that those with a higher (current balance + their min_balance) are placed first. Wait, but maybe the order should be based on their min_balance and total. For the positive group, sequences with higher (minimum balance) should come first. Because sequences that have a higher min_balance (less negative) would allow more flexibility when combined.

Wait, for sequences with total >= 0, the key is that their min_balance plus the current balance before adding them must be >=0. To maximize the number of possible sequences, we should process sequences in an order that allows the maximum possible current balance.

But how to order them. Let's think: For sequences with total >=0, the minimum balance is during their processing. So when adding a sequence after a current balance of 'current', the current balance during processing this sequence is at least current + min_balance. This needs to be >=0.

So for two sequences A and B in the positive group (total >=0), what's the order that allows more flexibility when combined? Suppose we have to choose between A and B. The order should be such that when A is added first, the resulting current balance is as high as possible, allowing B to be added next without violating the min_balance condition.

But since both sequences have total >=0, their combined total is A_total + B_total. The order in which they are added may affect the intermediate balance.

For example, consider two sequences:

A: ()( => total is +1, min_balance is 0 (starts at 1, then 0, then 1). Wait, let's parse it. The sequence "()(" would have:

- After first '(', balance 1. Min is 1.
- Then ')', balance 0. Min is 0.
- Then '(', balance 1. So total is +1. Min_balance is 0.

B: )(( => total is +1. Let's parse this. The sequence is ') ( ('.

- Starts with ')', balance -1 (min is -1).
- Then '(', balance 0 (min remains -1).
- Then '(', balance +1. So total is +1, min_balance is -1.

Now, if we have a current balance of 0. If we add B first, the min_balance during B is -1. So current balance (0) + B's min_balance (-1) is -1 <0. So this is invalid. But if we add A first, the min_balance is 0. So current balance (0) + A's min_balance (0) is 0 >=0. After processing A, the current balance becomes 1. Then adding B: current balance (1) + B's min_balance (-1) = 0 >=0. So that's okay.

So the order of A then B is acceptable, but B then A is not. So for sequences in the positive group, we need to order them in a way that sequences with higher (min_balance) are placed first. Because their min_balance is higher (i.e., less negative), so when adding them earlier, the current balance is higher, allowing more sequences to be added after.

So the correct approach for the positive group is to sort them in decreasing order of (min_balance). Wait, but wait, for two sequences A and B in the positive group, when their min_balance is considered, the one with higher min_balance is better to place first. Because when you process A first, the current balance after A is (current + A_total). Then when adding B, the current balance before adding B is (current + A_total). So for B's min_balance, which is lower, but since the initial balance is higher, the sum (current + A_total + B's min_balance) might be >=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to order the positive sequences is by the difference between their min_balance and their total. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the problem in terms of dependencies between the sequences.

For the positive group, the key is that each sequence's min_balance plus the current balance before adding it must be >=0. Once the sequence is added, the current balance increases by the total of the sequence.

So, the order of these sequences should be such that sequences that require a lower initial balance (i.e., can be added earlier without causing the min_balance to dip below zero) are added first. But how?

Alternatively, the sequences in the positive group should be sorted in a way that for any two sequences A and B, the optimal order is A before B if:

The minimal required initial balance (which is max(-A.min_balance, 0)) is less than that of B. Or perhaps there's a specific way to compare A and B to determine which order is better.

Wait, the minimal required initial balance for a sequence X is the maximum between ( -X.min_balance ) and 0. Because if X's min_balance is -m (so during processing, the balance dips by m), the initial balance must be at least m to ensure that during processing X, the balance never goes below zero.

So for sequence X, the required initial balance is max( -X.min_balance, 0 ). So sequences with higher required initial balance need to be placed later, when the current balance is higher.

So for sequences in the positive group, we should sort them in such a way that the required initial balance (R) is as small as possible. So the ones with smaller R come first.

But how to compare two sequences A and B.

Let's say R_A is the required initial balance for A (max(-A.min_balance, 0)), and R_B is same for B.

If A is placed before B:

After placing A, the current balance becomes initial + A.total.

Then placing B requires that initial + A.total >= R_B.

If B is placed before A:

After B, the current balance becomes initial + B.total.

Then placing A requires initial + B.total >= R_A.

So which order allows for a higher possible current balance after both, thus allowing more sequences to be added later?

Alternatively, the optimal order is the one that allows the maximum possible current balance after processing both sequences.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to find a comparator that can sort the sequences in the correct order.

Alternatively, the required condition for placing A before B is that (R_A <= current_balance) and (R_B <= (current_balance + A.total)), and after placing both, the total is current_balance + A.total + B.total.

But how to model this when the initial current_balance is not fixed (since it depends on previous sequences).

This seems tricky. Perhaps there's a known greedy approach here.

I recall a similar problem where the optimal way to arrange sequences is to sort them based on the difference between their min_balance and their total. Or perhaps based on their (min_balance, total) in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to sort the positive sequences is to compare two sequences A and B, and decide which comes first based on the following condition:

We want to choose the order that allows the sequences to be placed in such a way that the combined required initial balance is minimized, or the final balance is maximized.

Alternatively, for two sequences A and B, the combined required initial balance for placing A then B is max(R_A, R_B - A.total). Because after placing A, the initial balance for B is the initial balance plus A.total. So for B's required initial balance (R_B), the initial balance after A's initial balance (which is initial_balance - R_A + A.total) must be >= R_B. Wait, maybe not. Let's think:

If we place A first:

The initial balance needed for A is R_A.

Then after processing A, the balance becomes (initial_balance + A.total - R_A). Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, the initial_balance is the balance before adding A. To process A safely, the initial_balance must be >= R_A (which is max(-A.min_balance, 0)). Then after processing A, the balance is initial_balance + (A's total). Because the total is (number of '(' - ')') in A.

So when you process A first, the initial_balance must be >= R_A. Then after processing A, the balance is initial_balance + A_total.

Now, processing B after A requires that (initial_balance + A_total) >= R_B. The required initial_balance for the combined sequence A followed by B is max(R_A, R_B - A_total).

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. For the order A followed by B to be possible, the initial_balance must satisfy two conditions:

initial_balance >= R_A (so that A can be processed), and (initial_balance + A_total) >= R_B (so that B can be processed after A).

So the minimal initial_balance required for the order A then B is max(R_A, R_B - A_total).

Similarly, for the order B then A, the required initial_balance is max(R_B, R_A - B_total).

So, between these two options, which order requires a lower initial_balance?

We want to choose the order which has the minimal max(R_A, R_B - A_total) versus max(R_B, R_A - B_total). The order that has the lower value is better because it allows the sequences to be placed with a lower initial balance, which is more likely to be possible given the previous sequences.

But how to compare this?

Alternatively, if we can arrange A before B when the sum of R_A and (R_B - A_total) is less than the other way around.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a way to model this as a comparator.

Alternatively, the optimal way to arrange two sequences A and B in the positive group is such that the sum (A.min_balance + B.min_balance + A.total) is considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe there's a way to model this as a pair (required_initial, delta), where delta is the total of the sequence.

For example, when processing a sequence, the required_initial is R (max(-min_balance, 0)), and delta is the total (total balance of the sequence).

So when you process a sequence, you need to have at least R initial balance, and after processing, the balance increases by delta.

So for two sequences, A and B:

If we process A then B:

The required initial balance is max(R_A, R_B - delta_A).

If we process B then A:

The required initial balance is max(R_B, R_A - delta_B).

We want to choose the order where the required initial is lower.

So which is better? Let's see.

Suppose for order A then B, the required initial is max(R_A, R_B - delta_A).

For order B then A, it's max(R_B, R_A - delta_B).

We need to compare these two values and choose the order that gives the smaller one.

But how do we model this in a way that allows us to sort all sequences in the group?

This is starting to look like a problem where the order of sequences can be determined by comparing pairs and checking which order gives a lower required initial. However, given that n is up to 20, perhaps this is manageable. Wait, but n can be up to 20, but the number of possible permutations is 20! which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the total n is up to 20. So perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Since 2^20 is around a million, but for 20 elements, the state would be something like the current balance and the mask of used sequences. But even that could be 20 bits for the mask and a balance that could be up to the sum of all totals (which could be up to 4e5). So that's way too big. So dynamic programming is not feasible.

Therefore, the solution must rely on a greedy approach.

But how to find a greedy order for the positive group.

Wait, there's a known approach in similar problems where sequences are ordered based on certain criteria. For example, in the problem of arranging brackets to form a valid sequence, sequences are sorted by their (min_balance, total) in a certain way.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by some bracket arrangement problems:

For sequences with total >=0 (positive group):

These sequences can be arranged in an order where the ones with higher (min_balance) come first. Because sequences with higher min_balance (less negative) require a lower initial balance. For example, a sequence with min_balance of -3 requires initial balance of 3, while a sequence with min_balance of -1 requires initial balance of 1. Placing the latter first allows the initial balance to be lower, which may help in combining more sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way to sort the positive sequences is by their (required_initial, -delta), so that sequences requiring a lower initial are placed first. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct sorting is to arrange the positive sequences in such a way that for any two sequences A and B, the required_initial for A followed by B is less than the required_initial for B followed by A. So we compare A and B and decide the order based on which gives a lower required_initial.

So for sequences A and B, we compare:

max(R_A, R_B - delta_A) vs max(R_B, R_A - delta_B).

If the first is less than or equal to the second, then A should come before B. Otherwise, B comes before A.

This way, when building the order, sequences are arranged such that the required initial balance is minimized.

But how can we model this as a comparator for sorting?

This is a pairwise comparison. However, such a comparator may not be transitive, leading to issues in sorting. But perhaps in practice, it works.

So the comparator for the positive group is: A should come before B if max(R_A, R_B - delta_A) <= max(R_B, R_A - delta_B).

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let me take an example. Let's say A has R_A = 3, delta_A = 5. B has R_B = 2, delta_B = 4.

Then, for order A then B: required_initial is max(3, 2 -5) = max(3, -3) = 3.

For order B then A: required_initial is max(2, 3 -4) = max(2, -1) = 2.

So in this case, order B then A is better (required_initial is 2 vs 3). So the comparator would say that B should come before A.

But how to derive this from the comparison function.

In this case, comparing max(3, 2-5)=3 vs max(2,3-4)=2. Since 3 > 2, the order B then A is better.

So the comparator would be to sort the sequences such that for A and B, if the required_initial for A followed by B is less than that for B followed by A, then A comes first. Else, B comes first.

So the comparator function for two sequences A and B is:

if max(R_A, R_B - A.delta) < max(R_B, R_A - B.delta) then A comes before B.

Else, B comes before A.

This would allow us to sort the sequences in the positive group using this comparator.

But how to compute this for all pairs and ensure the sorting works correctly. Since this is a pairwise comparison, it's possible that the order is not transitive, but perhaps in practice, it works for our problem.

So for the positive group, sequences are sorted according to this comparator.

Now for the negative group (sequences with total <0):

These sequences contribute to a decrease in the total balance. However, since their total is negative, adding them will reduce the current balance. The problem is to arrange them in an order that allows the maximum number of valid prefixes.

But how to handle them. For sequences in the negative group, after the positive group and the negative group, the total balance must be zero. Because all valid prefixes must have balance zero. Wait, but the entire concatenated sequence can have a non-zero balance, but the valid prefixes are those which are RBS (balance zero). So the total balance of all sequences must be zero, otherwise there will be no valid prefixes of the entire concatenation. So the first step is to check that the sum of all sequences' total is zero. If not, then it's impossible to have any valid prefixes. Wait, no. Because even if the total is non-zero, there might be some prefixes that are RBS. For example, if the total is +2, then the entire string can't be an RBS, but maybe some prefixes have balance zero. But the problem statement counts all such valid prefixes.

But the sum of all sequences' totals is the balance of the entire concatenated string. However, for the entire concatenated string to have any RBS prefixes, it's not necessary for the total balance to be zero. For example, in the first sample input, the total balance is zero. But if the sum is non-zero, there might be some prefixes with balance zero. But arranging the sequences in a way that allows the maximum number of such prefixes.

But the sum of all sequences' total is a crucial factor. Because if the sum is non-zero, then the entire concatenated string's balance is that sum, and thus there can be no prefixes that are RBS after the point where the cumulative balance exceeds that sum.

But in any case, the algorithm must account for the sum of all sequences' totals. So first, we need to compute the sum of all sequences' balances. If that sum is not zero, then the maximum possible prefixes would be those that reach balance zero at some point. So even if the total is non-zero, we can still have some valid prefixes.

But the problem requires the maximum possible number of valid prefixes regardless of the total sum. So we can't ignore the sum. For example, if the sum is non-zero, the entire string can't be a valid prefix, but there may be some intermediate valid prefixes.

But how does the sum affect the arrangement of sequences. For example, if the sum is positive, then the concatenated string's balance is positive, so the entire string isn't a valid prefix. But there could be some prefixes with balance zero.

However, the problem requires us to find the maximum number of non-empty prefixes that are RBS. So regardless of the total sum, we can arrange the sequences to maximize the number of such prefixes.

But to get the maximum number, the arrangement must allow as many points where the cumulative balance is zero, and the balance never drops below zero.

So the first step is to compute the total balance of all sequences. If the total balance is not zero, then the number of valid prefixes is limited to the points where the cumulative balance is zero. However, the total balance must be considered when arranging the sequences.

But how to handle this. Let's think:

The total sum S is the sum of all sequences' balance. If S is not zero, then the entire concatenated string's balance is S. So, for the entire string to be a valid prefix, S must be zero. But even if S is not zero, there may be valid prefixes in the middle.

But the arrangement of sequences must allow the cumulative balance to reach zero as often as possible, without ever dipping below zero.

So the approach is to arrange the sequences in such a way that:

- The positive sequences are arranged first in an order that allows the cumulative balance to stay as high as possible.

- The negative sequences are arranged after, in an order that allows the cumulative balance to decrease in a way that allows the balance to hit zero as many times as possible.

But how to model this.

Wait, for the negative group, each sequence's total is negative, and their min_balance (during their processing) is less than or equal to their total (since total is (opens - closes)). So for sequences with negative total, their min_balance could be even lower than the total.

But when adding a negative sequence, the current balance before adding it must be such that during processing, the balance doesn't drop below zero.

So for a sequence in the negative group, the required initial balance before processing it is max( (current_balance + min_balance) >=0 ). Which is equivalent to current_balance >= -min_balance.

Wait, but during processing a sequence, the balance can't dip below zero. So the initial balance plus the cumulative balance at any step in the sequence must be >=0.

The minimum balance of the sequence is min_balance. So the initial balance before processing the sequence must be >= -min_balance. Otherwise, adding the sequence would cause the balance to drop below zero at some point.

So for a negative sequence X, the required initial balance is max( -X.min_balance, 0 ). Because if X's min_balance is m, then initial balance must be >= -m to ensure that during processing X, the balance never drops below zero.

But how to arrange the negative sequences to maximize the number of valid prefixes.

Once all positive sequences are processed, the current balance is P (sum of their totals). Then, the negative sequences are processed in some order. Each of them reduces the current balance.

But how to arrange them so that during their processing, the balance dips to zero as many times as possible, and the required initial balance for each sequence is satisfied.

The arrangement of the negative group may be similar to the positive group, but in reverse. For example, arrange them in such a way that their (required initial balance + their total) is maximized, to allow more sequences to be added.

Alternatively, for the negative group, sequences should be arranged in an order that allows the cumulative balance to reach zero as many times as possible.

Alternatively, for the negative group, perhaps the sequences should be sorted in such a way that their required initial balance is as low as possible, but considering their effect on the balance.

Wait, but the negative sequences have a total that is negative. So their arrangement is important to ensure that the cumulative balance can drop to zero, but without going negative.

For example, let's say we have two negative sequences:

A: )()( (balance is -2, min_balance is -1.

Required initial balance for A is max( -(-1), 0 ) = 1.

B: )))( (balance is -2, min_balance is -3.

Required initial balance is 3.

If the current balance after positive sequences is 3.

If we process B first:

current_balance =3 >=3 (required for B). After processing B, balance is 3-2=1.

Then process A: current_balance=1 >=1. After A, balance is 1-2= -1. But this is allowed, but then any sequences after would need to handle this, but in this case, there are no more sequences. So the cumulative balance after all sequences is -1, which is invalid. But during processing, the balance after B is 1, then after A is -1.

But during processing A, the balance starts at 1. The sequence A's min_balance is -1, so during processing, the balance starts at 1, goes down by 1, then up by 1, then down again. Wait, no. Let's parse sequence A:

A is )()(:

The sequence is ') ( ) ('.

Processing:

balance starts at 1.

After ')': 0. Min is 0.

After '(': 1.

After ')': 0.

After '(': 1.

So the min_balance is 0. So the required initial balance for A is 0. So current_balance before processing A is 1 >=0. So it's allowed.

After processing A, the balance is 1 + (-2) = -1. But during processing, the balance never went below zero.

So in this case, even though the total is -2, the processing is allowed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The sequence's total is (number of '(') minus (number of ')'). For example, if a sequence is ')()(', that's three closing and three opening? No, wait:

')()(' has length 4:

Characters: ')', '(', ')', '('.

Number of '(': 2, number of ')': 2. So total is 0. Min_balance would be after first ')': -1, then back to 0, then -1 again, then 0. So min_balance is -1. So required initial balance is 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's compute the balance step by step.

For the sequence ')()(':

Start with balance 0.

After first character ')': balance -1 (min is -1).

After '(': balance 0 (min still -1).

After ')': balance -1 (min now -1).

After '(': balance 0 (min remains -1).

So the total is 0 (2 '(' and 2 ')'), and the min_balance is -1.

So required initial balance is 1 (max(-(-1), 0)).

So to process this sequence, the initial balance must be >=1.

So during processing, the initial balance is 1. Then the sequence starts:

After ')', balance 0.

After '(', balance 1.

After ')', balance 0.

After '(', balance 1.

The balance during processing never drops below 0.

So the key is that the initial balance is sufficient to cover the min_balance of the sequence.

But in this example, the sequence's total is zero. So for sequences with total zero, they are part of the positive group (since total >=0).

So back to the negative group.

For sequences with negative total, their arrangement requires that the initial balance is sufficient to handle their min_balance. But their total is negative, so they decrease the current balance.

So the problem with negative sequences is that when arranged in a certain order, they require the initial balance to be higher. So for example, a sequence with higher required initial balance (R) needs to be placed earlier when the current balance is higher.

Wait, perhaps the negative group should be sorted in such a way that sequences with higher (R - delta) are placed first, where delta is the total (which is negative). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the correct way to arrange the negative group is in the reverse order of the positive group. Because when processing the negative group, you want to use up as much of the current balance as possible, allowing sequences to be added in an order that requires higher initial balance first, when the current balance is still high.

For example, imagine two negative sequences:

A: requires initial balance 3, delta -2.

B: requires initial balance 2, delta -1.

The current balance before adding the negative group is 5.

If we process A first:

Initial balance is 5 >=3. After processing A, balance is 5-2=3. Then process B: requires 2 <=3. After B, balance 3-1=2.

If processed in the reverse order:

Process B first: requires 2 <=5. Balance becomes 5-1=4. Then process A: requires 3 <=4. Balance becomes 4-2=2.

So both orders are possible. But the order in which higher R sequences are processed first allows more sequences to be added.

So perhaps the negative group should be sorted in descending order of (R + delta), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the negative group sequences should be sorted in a way that for any two sequences A and B, A should come before B if the required initial balance for A followed by B is less than or equal to that of B followed by A.

This is similar to the positive group approach.

So for sequences in the negative group, the comparator is the same as for the positive group: compare the required initial for each order and choose the one with lower required.

But since the negative group's delta is negative, the required initial for A followed by B would be:

max(R_A, R_B - A.delta) 

But since A.delta is negative, R_B - A.delta is R_B + |A.delta|. Which is higher than R_B.

So the required initial for A followed by B is max(R_A, R_B + |A.delta|).

For B followed by A: max(R_B, R_A + |B.delta|).

We want to choose the order that gives the smaller required initial.

But since the negative group is processed after the positive group, the current balance is high (P = sum of positive deltas). Then, processing the negative sequences in an order that allows as many as possible to be added, considering their R and deltas.

Alternatively, the correct way to sort the negative group is in reverse order of the comparator used for the positive group. For example, sequences are sorted by (R + delta), which for negative deltas is R + (negative number). So higher R sequences may need to come first.

But this is getting a bit unclear.

Maybe the correct approach is:

For the negative group, arrange the sequences in the order that would be optimal if they were part of the positive group but with their delta negated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the negative group should be sorted in the opposite way as the positive group, but I'm not sure.

An alternative approach is to model this problem as follows:

We need to arrange all sequences in such a way that:

1. All positive sequences are arranged in an order determined by the comparator discussed earlier.

2. All negative sequences are arranged in an order determined by a similar comparator, but adjusted for their negative deltas.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: once the positive sequences are processed, the current balance is P. The negative sequences need to be arranged in such a way that their required initial balance is met, and their processing brings the cumulative balance down from P to S (the sum of all sequences' totals). But since the sum S is sum of all sequences, which must be equal to P + sum of negative deltas.

Wait, yes. Because the sum of positive deltas (sum of positive group) is P. Sum of negative deltas (sum of negative group) is N. So total sum S = P + N.

If S is not zero, then the entire concatenated string can't be an RBS. But some prefixes may be RBS.

But during the processing of the negative group, we can arrange them in a way that the balance decreases from P to S in steps, creating as many points where the cumulative balance is zero as possible.

So the problem reduces to:

Arrange the negative sequences in such a way that during their processing, the balance decreases from P to S, and as many times as possible the balance reaches zero.

But how.

For example, suppose P is 5, and the sum of the negative deltas is -5, so S=0. The negative group's sum is -5. We need to arrange the negative sequences such that during their processing, the balance decreases from 5 to 0, hitting zero at some points.

Each time the cumulative balance hits zero, that's a valid prefix.

So the arrangement of the negative sequences should allow the balance to reach zero multiple times.

But how to achieve that.

The key here is that each negative sequence's delta is the change in the balance. So when a sequence's processing causes the balance to drop by delta (a negative number, so balance increases by delta, which is negative, so balance decreases).

But to hit zero, the cumulative balance after processing some sequences must be zero.

For example, if the negative group consists of two sequences: A with delta -3 and B with delta -2. P is 5.

If arranged as A then B:

After positive group, balance is 5.

Process A: balance becomes 5-3=2. Process B: 2-2=0. So during processing B, the balance after processing is 0. But the entire concatenation's balance is zero. So the valid prefixes are the entire concatenation.

But if the sequences are arranged in a way that during processing, the balance reaches zero multiple times.

But this example only has one valid prefix (the entire concatenation). So how to arrange them for more hits.

Alternatively, suppose the negative group has three sequences with deltas -2, -2, and -1. P is 5.

If arranged as (-2, -2, -1):

Processing:

5 → 3 (after first -2) → 1 (after second -2) → 0 (after -1). So during processing, the balance reaches 3, 1, 0. Only the last step reaches zero.

But if arranged as (-1, -2, -2):

After positive group: 5.

Process -1: balance 4. Not zero.

Process -2: balance 2.

Process -2: balance 0.

Again, one hit.

Alternatively, if the negative group consists of sequences with delta -1, -2, -1, and P=4.

Then arranged as -1, -1, -2:

Process -1: 3.

Process -1: 2.

Process -2: 0. One hit.

Alternatively, arrange as -1, -2, -1.

Process -1: 3.

Process -2: 1.

Process -1: 0. Again, one hit.

Hmm. So perhaps the way the negative sequences are arranged doesn't affect the number of times the balance hits zero during their processing. But perhaps not. Let's think of another example.

Suppose P is 3, and the negative group has two sequences: A (delta -1), B (delta -2). Sum of deltas is -3. So total sum is zero.

If arranged as A then B:

Processing:

3 → 2 (after A) → 0 (after B). One hit.

If arranged as B then A:

3 → 1 (after B) → 0 (after A). One hit.

So same number of hits.

Another example: P=4, negative sequences are A (delta -2), B (delta -1), C (delta -1). Sum is -4. So S=0.

Arranged as A, B, C:

4 → 2 (A) → 1 (B) → 0 (C). One hit.

Arranged as B, C, A:

4 → 3 (B) → 2 (C) → 0 (A). One hit.

Arranged as B, A, C:

4 →3 (B) → 1 (A) → 0 (C). One hit.

Alternatively, if there's a sequence with delta -3 and another with -1:

P=4.

Arrange -3 first: 4 →1 (after -3) → 0 (after -1). Two steps, one hit.

Arrange -1 first: 4 →3 (after -1) → 0 (after -3). One hit.

Wait, in the first case:

Processing -3:

Start with balance 4. The sequence's delta is -3, so balance after processing is 4-3=1. But during processing, the balance could dip to zero. For example, if the sequence is ")))", then during processing:

balance starts at 4. After first ')': 3. After second: 2. Third: 1. So balance never hits zero. So the valid prefix is only after processing both sequences.

But in this case, the valid prefixes are only after the entire concatenation.

So the arrangement of negative sequences might not influence the number of valid prefixes in some cases. But how to maximize the number of valid prefixes.

Hmm. This suggests that the way the negative sequences are arranged may not significantly impact the number of valid prefixes. So perhaps the main focus is on the positive sequences and their arrangement.

Alternatively, the number of valid prefixes is determined by the cumulative balance after each step. Each time the cumulative balance is zero, that's a valid prefix.

The problem is to arrange the sequences such that the cumulative balance reaches zero as many times as possible, without ever dipping below zero.

So the maximum number of valid prefixes is the number of times the cumulative balance reaches zero after adding each character in the concatenated string. But since the sequences are arranged in blocks, the arrangement of sequences can allow the cumulative balance to reach zero at certain points between sequences.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: the arrangement of sequences should maximize the number of positions where the cumulative balance is zero, and at no point before that does the balance drop below zero.

But how to compute this.

Let's think of the arrangement as a list of sequences. For each sequence in the list, when it is added, the balance changes according to the sequence's characters. The challenge is to order the sequences such that the cumulative balance after each step (sequence) is as likely to be zero as possible, but also that during processing each sequence, the balance never drops below zero.

But how to model this.

The key is that when you arrange sequences in a certain order, the balance after each sequence's processing could be zero. Each such occurrence is a valid prefix.

So for example, if after some sequences the balance is zero, that's a valid prefix.

But how to maximize this.

Another observation: the total sum of all sequences' deltas must be zero to have the possibility of the entire concatenated sequence being a valid prefix. But even if the total sum is not zero, some prefixes may be valid.

But to maximize the number of valid prefixes, the arrangement must allow the cumulative balance to reach zero as many times as possible.

So the approach is:

1. Arrange the sequences in such a way that during their processing, the balance never drops below zero.

2. Within that constraint, arrange them to reach zero as many times as possible.

So the steps for solving the problem are:

1. Precompute for each sequence its total delta and min_balance.

2. Split the sequences into positive (delta >=0) and negative (delta <0) groups.

3. Sort the positive group using the comparator discussed earlier.

4. Sort the negative group using a different comparator (perhaps similar to the positive group, but adjusted for negative delta).

5. Concatenate the positive and negative groups in this order and check the maximum number of valid prefixes.

But how to handle the negative group.

Alternatively, the negative group must be processed after the positive group. But once the positive group is processed, the current balance is P (sum of their deltas). Then the negative group must reduce this balance to S = sum of all deltas (P + sum of negative deltas).

The arrangement of the negative group must be such that during their processing, the balance never drops below zero, and reaches zero as many times as possible.

But how.

Another idea: for the negative group, we want to process sequences in an order that allows the balance to reach zero as many times as possible. So arrange the sequences in such a way that each sequence's delta is subtracted as late as possible, allowing the balance to reach zero multiple times.

But this is vague.

Alternatively, for the negative group, the sequences should be arranged in such a way that the required initial balance is as low as possible. But since the current balance after positive group is P, we have to arrange the negative sequences in an order that requires their required initial balance to be as low as possible, allowing more sequences to be processed.

This brings us back to the same comparator as the positive group: arrange the negative sequences in such a way that for any two sequences A and B, the order A followed by B requires a lower initial balance than B followed by A.

So the negative group is sorted using the same comparator as the positive group.

But how does this affect the processing.

For example, consider two negative sequences:

A: required_initial R_A = 3, delta_A = -2.

B: required_initial R_B = 2, delta_B = -3.

Current balance after positive group is 5.

Compare the required initial balance for A followed by B and B followed by A.

Order A then B:

required_initial = max(R_A, R_B - delta_A) = max(3, 2 - (-2)) = max(3, 4) =4.

Order B then A:

required_initial = max(R_B, R_A - delta_B) = max(2, 3 - (-3)) = max(2, 6) =6.

So order A then B requires initial balance 4, which is possible since current balance is 5 >=4. Processing A then B:

After A: balance 5 -2 =3. Which is >= R_B (2). Then B: balance 3-3=0.

So this order is possible.

But required_initial is 4, which is <=5.

So the order A then B is better.

Thus, the comparator would sort A before B.

So in this case, the comparator would order A and B based on the required_initial for their sequence.

So the negative group is sorted using the same comparator as the positive group.

Thus, the approach is:

- For positive group: sort using the comparator.

- For negative group: sort using the comparator.

But wait, the negative group has delta <0. So when we compute R_B - delta_A for the required_initial, delta_A is negative. So R_B - delta_A = R_B + (-delta_A). For example, if R_B is 2 and delta_A is -2, then R_B - delta_A = 4.

So the required_initial for A followed by B would be max(R_A, R_B + (-delta_A)).

But delta_A is negative, so (-delta_A) is positive.

So this is the required_initial for A followed by B.

Thus, for negative sequences, the required_initial is based on the same formula.

So the same comparator is used for both groups.

Thus, the overall steps are:

1. For each sequence, compute:

   a. delta (number of '(' minus ')').

   b. min_balance (the minimum balance encountered while processing the sequence).

   c. R = max( -min_balance, 0 )

2. Split sequences into positive (delta >=0) and negative (delta <0) groups.

3. Sort the positive group using the comparator: a comes before b if max(a.R, b.R - a.delta) < max(b.R, a.R - b.delta).

4. Sort the negative group using the same comparator.

5. Check if the sum of all deltas is zero. If not, the total balance is S = sum_deltas. So any prefix must have a balance of zero.

   But even if sum is not zero, we can have valid prefixes as long as the cumulative balance is zero at some points.

6. Concatenate the sorted positive group and then the sorted negative group, and compute the cumulative balance and the number of times it reaches zero.

7. Also, during the processing of each character in the concatenated sequences, ensure that the balance never drops below zero. If at any point the balance drops below zero, the entire arrangement is invalid, and no valid prefixes are possible beyond that point.

But wait, the arrangement is supposed to be valid, i.e., during processing the concatenated sequences, the balance never drops below zero.

But how to verify that the chosen order of sequences meets this condition.

The sorting of the sequences using the comparator ensures that during processing each sequence, the balance before processing it is >= required_initial for that sequence, thus ensuring that during processing the sequence, the balance never drops below zero.

But how to verify this.

The comparator is supposed to find an order of sequences where, when processed in that order, the required initial balance for each sequence is satisfied by the cumulative balance up to that point.

But how to compute this.

Once the sequences are sorted according to the comparator, we can simulate their processing and check if the required initial balance is met for each sequence.

But the problem is that the order generated by the comparator might not be possible to process, because the required initial balance for a sequence might not be met.

But how to handle this.

Perhaps the comparator-based sorting ensures that the required initial balance for each sequence is satisfied. But this is not guaranteed unless the comparator is correct.

Alternatively, after sorting, we need to process the sequences in the sorted order and check if the required initial balance is met for each step. If not, then this order is invalid, and we need to try other permutations.

But with n up to 20, trying all permutations is impossible.

Thus, the comparator-based sorting is a greedy approach that may or may not work.

But according to some references, this is a known approach for this type of problem, and the comparator is correct for the positive group.

So the plan is:

- Sort positive and negative groups using the comparator.

- Concatenate them and check if the arrangement is valid (balance never drops below zero during processing).

- If it is valid, compute the number of valid prefixes.

But what if there are multiple valid arrangements and some yield more valid prefixes than others?

The problem is to find the maximum number of valid prefixes possible, so the arrangement that allows the most zero points in the cumulative balance.

But how to find that arrangement.

An alternative approach is to realize that the maximum number of valid prefixes is equal to the number of times the cumulative balance is zero and all previous balances are non-negative.

So the problem reduces to finding an arrangement of sequences that allows the cumulative balance to reach zero as often as possible, while ensuring the balance never drops below zero.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the sequences such that the cumulative balance after each sequence is as small as possible, thus allowing more opportunities for it to reach zero.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, after processing the sequences, the cumulative balance after each sequence is a candidate for being zero.

So the maximum number of valid prefixes is the number of times the cumulative balance reaches zero.

Thus, the arrangement should be such that after as many sequences as possible, the cumulative balance is zero.

But how to achieve this.

For example, if there are sequences that, when added, bring the cumulative balance to zero, those should be placed early.

But this depends on the delta of the sequences.

But this is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial plan:

- Split into positive and negative groups.

- Sort each group using the comparator.

- Check if the total sum is zero. If not, the arrangement may still have valid prefixes.

- Simulate the processing of the sorted sequences and count the number of valid prefixes.

So now, let's proceed to code.

First, we need to process each sequence to compute delta, min_balance, and R.

Then, split into positive and negative groups.

Sort the positive group using the comparator.

Sort the negative group using the comparator.

Then, concatenate the positive and negative groups, and simulate the processing.

But wait, the negative group may be sorted, but perhaps in reverse order. Or perhaps the negative group should be sorted in the same way as the positive group, but then processed after.

Once the sorted groups are obtained, we need to compute the cumulative balance and check for valid prefixes.

But during simulation, we need to process each sequence in the order, and during processing each character, compute the current balance. If at any point the balance drops below zero, the entire arrangement is invalid and no valid prefixes are possible beyond that point.

But this would be too slow for large sequences (up to 4e5 characters).

So this approach is not feasible for large inputs. So we need a way to simulate the processing of the sequences without processing each character.

But wait, each sequence's processing can be modeled as:

- The sequence's delta.

- The sequence's min_balance.

The required initial balance for the sequence is R = max( -min_balance, 0 ).

When processing the sequence, the initial balance must be >= R.

After processing the sequence, the balance increases by delta.

But during the processing of the sequence, the balance may go up and down, but as long as the initial balance is >= R, the balance will never drop below zero.

So the entire sequence can be treated as a single step: initial balance >= R, and after processing, the balance becomes initial + delta.

Thus, to simulate the processing of all sequences, we can track the current balance and check for each sequence:

- current_balance >= R_i, where R_i is the sequence's required initial balance.

- Then, current_balance += delta_i.

This is a key insight. Because during processing a sequence, the balance will not drop below zero if the initial balance is >= R_i.

Thus, the entire simulation can be done in O(n) steps, instead of O(total_length) steps.

This is crucial for handling large inputs.

So the steps are:

1. Compute for each sequence its delta, min_balance, R.

2. Split into positive and negative groups.

3. Sort each group using the comparator.

4. Concatenate the two groups.

5. Simulate processing the sorted sequences:

   a. current_balance starts at 0.

   b. For each sequence in the sorted order:

      i. Check if current_balance >= R_i. If not, the arrangement is invalid. Processing stops, and any further sequences do not contribute to valid prefixes.

      ii. current_balance += delta_i.

      iii. If during the processing of this sequence, the balance after adding delta_i is zero, then this contributes to a valid prefix.

      iv. Also, during the processing of the sequence, the cumulative balance after adding this sequence may have been zero. So each such occurrence contributes to the count.

   c. Additionally, during the processing of the sequence's characters, there might be points where the balance reaches zero. However, according to the way the sequences are sorted, these points can only occur at the end of the sequence.

Wait, no. The initial balance is >= R_i, which is >= -min_balance. The sequence's min_balance is the lowest point during processing. So during processing the sequence, the balance starts at current_balance and goes to current_balance + delta_i. The lowest point is current_balance + min_balance (since the sequence's min_balance is the minimum during its processing).

But since current_balance >= R_i = max( -min_balance, 0 ), we have current_balance >= -min_balance.

Thus, during processing the sequence, the balance never drops below current_balance + min_balance >= R_i + min_balance >= max( -min_balance, 0 ) + min_balance.

If min_balance is negative (which it can be), then max( -min_balance, 0 ) is -min_balance if min_balance <0. So R_i = -min_balance.

Thus, current_balance >= R_i = -min_balance.

So during processing the sequence:

balance starts at current_balance.

The minimum balance during processing is current_balance + min_balance.

Since current_balance >= -min_balance, this is >=0.

So during processing the sequence, the balance never drops below zero.

Thus, any valid prefix can only occur at the end of a sequence's processing. Because during processing the sequence, the balance is non-negative, but the cumulative balance after each character is non-negative. So the valid prefixes are those where the cumulative balance after some sequence is zero.

But this is only true if the entire arrangement is valid.

Thus, the number of valid prefixes is the number of times the cumulative balance after processing a sequence equals zero.

Thus, during simulation, after processing each sequence, we check if the current_balance is zero. If so, we increment the count.

This is a critical observation that allows us to compute the number of valid prefixes efficiently.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

- Sort the positive and negative groups as described.

- Simulate processing each sequence in the sorted order:

   - Check if current_balance >= R_i. If not, break (processing stops, no further valid prefixes).

   - Update current_balance += delta_i.

   - If current_balance == zero, increment the count.

Thus, the code can be written to process each sequence in O(1) steps, leading to O(n) time for the simulation.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:

2

(

)

Processing each sequence:

Each sequence's delta:

Sequence '(': delta = +1. Min balance is 1 (since starts at 1, no closing). R = max( -1, 0 ) → 1.

Sequence ')': delta = -1. Min balance is -1. R = max( 1, 0 ) → 1.

Positive group: sequence '(', delta +1.

Negative group: sequence ')', delta -1.

Sort the positive group using comparator. Only one sequence.

Sort the negative group: only one sequence.

Concatenate: positive first, then negative.

Simulate:

current_balance =0.

Process '(': R=1. current_balance must be >=1 → 0 <1 → invalid. So processing stops. No valid prefixes.

Wait, this contradicts the example.

Wait, the example's solution is to arrange '(' followed by ')', which results in the string "()", which has one valid prefix.

But according to our simulation, the initial balance is 0, which is less than the required initial balance of 1 for the '(', so processing is invalid. So this approach would return 0, which is incorrect.

So there's a flaw in the approach.

What's wrong here?

Ah, here's the mistake: the initial current_balance for processing the sequences is zero, but after the sequences are arranged, the initial balance for the first sequence must be >= R_i.

In this case, the first sequence is '(', which has R_i = 1 (since min_balance is 1). But the initial current_balance is zero. So 0 < 1, thus the arrangement is invalid. However, the correct arrangement is to process '(' followed by ')', but according to the code's simulation, this is not allowed.

But this is incorrect because the code's simulation assumes that the initial balance for the first sequence is zero. But the initial balance is zero. But the required initial balance for the first sequence is 1, which is not met. Thus, the code's simulation would reject this arrangement, leading to zero valid prefixes. But the correct answer is 1.

This indicates that the approach is flawed.

What's wrong here?

The problem is that the required initial balance for the sequence is computed as R_i = max( -min_balance, 0 ). Let's compute this correctly.

For the sequence '(', the delta is +1. The min_balance during processing is 1 (since it's a single '('). So during processing this sequence, the balance starts at the initial balance, which must be >= R_i = max( -1, 0 ) → 0. So R_i is 0. So the required initial balance is 0.

So the code's previous calculation was incorrect.

Ah! This is a critical mistake. Let's re-calculate R_i.

For the sequence '(', the balance during processing is 1. The min_balance is 1. So R_i = max( -1, 0 ) → max(-1, 0) is 0. So the required initial balance is 0.

But how?

The sequence is '(', so processing it starts with balance 0 (initial balance). The balance after processing is 1. The min_balance is 0 + 1 = 1? Or is the balance during processing the sequence computed as initial_balance plus the sequence's own balance?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the min_balance for a sequence.

The min_balance of a sequence is the minimum balance that occurs while processing that sequence, starting from zero. Then, when the sequence is added to the current balance, the actual balance during processing is the initial balance plus each step's delta.

So the min_balance for the sequence is the minimum value of (balance after each step of the sequence, starting from zero).

But when the sequence is part of the concatenation, the initial balance is added to the sequence's balance steps.

So for example, the sequence '(' has balance steps: +1. So min_balance is 1. But when processed with an initial balance of zero, the balance during processing is 1. But if the initial balance is zero, then during processing, the balance starts at zero and becomes 1 after adding the first character. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

When processing a sequence, the balance is computed as follows:

- Start with the initial balance (current_balance).

- For each character in the sequence:

   if '(', add 1 to balance.

   if ')', subtract 1.

- The sequence's min_balance is the minimum balance encountered during processing the sequence, starting from zero.

But when the sequence is part of the larger concatenation, the initial balance is added to this sequence's balance steps.

So for example, if the sequence is '(', which has balance steps: 1.

The min_balance for the sequence is 1 (since it's the only step).

But when processing this sequence with an initial balance of zero, the actual balance during processing is 0 +1 =1. So the min_balance during processing this sequence in this context is 1.

The required initial balance R_i is computed as max( - (sequence's min_balance) , 0 ), but this sequence's min_balance is 1. So R_i = max( -1, 0 ) → 0.

Thus, the required initial balance is zero. So processing the sequence '(', when the current_balance is zero, is allowed.

Thus, the simulation would proceed:

current_balance =0.

Process sequence '(', R_i is 0. current_balance >=0 → yes.

current_balance +=1 → 1.

Check if current_balance is zero → no. So no count.

Then process sequence ')', which is in the negative group. Compute its delta (-1), min_balance is -1 (when processed as a standalone sequence).

R_i for this sequence is max( -(-1), 0 ) → max(1, 0) →1.

So current_balance is 1 >=1 → yes.

current_balance += (-1) →0.

Check if current_balance is zero → yes. Count increments by 1.

Thus, the code would output 1, which matches the example.

So the previous mistake was in calculating R_i for the sequence '('. The correct R_i is 0, not 1.

Thus, the code must correctly compute R_i as max( -min_balance, 0 ), where min_balance is the minimum balance of the sequence when processed standalone (starting from zero).

This highlights the importance of correctly computing the min_balance and R_i for each sequence.

Thus, the code needs to:

For each sequence:

- Compute the balance after each character, starting from zero.

- Track the minimum balance encountered during this process.

The R_i is then max( -min_balance, 0 ).

Thus, the code's first step is to compute these values correctly.

Now, let's proceed to code.

The code steps:

Read n.

For each of the n sequences:

   Compute delta: the sum of +1 for '(', -1 for ')'.

   Compute min_balance:

      current_balance =0

      min_b =0

      for char in sequence:

          current_balance += 1 if char == '(' else -1

          if current_balance < min_b:

              min_b = current_balance

      min_balance = min_b

   R = max( -min_balance, 0 )

   store delta, R.

Split into positive and negative groups based on delta.

Sort positive group using comparator: a comes before b if max(a.R, b.R - a.delta) < max(b.R, a.R - b.delta).

Sort negative group using the same comparator.

Concatenate the sorted positive group and sorted negative group.

Simulate processing:

current_balance =0

count =0

for each sequence in the concatenated list:

   if current_balance < sequence.R:

       break

   current_balance += sequence.delta

   if current_balance ==0:

       count +=1

return count.

Thus, the code must implement the comparator for sorting the groups.

But how to implement the comparator in Python.

In Python, the sorted function can use a key, but for a comparator, we need to use a custom comparison function. However, in Python 3, the 'cmp' parameter is not available. So we need to convert the comparator into a key function.

This is a challenge. For two elements a and b, we need to decide if a should come before b based on the comparator.

An alternative approach is to use the 'functools.cmp_to_key' function, which converts a comparator into a key.

Thus, the code can use the following comparator function:

def compare(a, b):

    # a and b are tuples (delta, R)

    # returns -1, 0, or 1

    # a should come before b if max(a.R, b.R - a.delta) <= max(b.R, a.R - b.delta)

    val1 = max(a[1], b[1] - a[0])

    val2 = max(b[1], a[1] - b[0])

    if val1 < val2:

        return -1

    elif val1 > val2:

        return 1

    else:

        return 0

Thus, the positive group is sorted using this comparator, and the negative group as well.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline())

        s = input_stream.readline().strip()

        delta = 0

        current = 0

        min_balance = 0

        for c in s:

            current += 1 if c == '(' else -1

            delta += 1 if c == '(' else -1

            if current < min_balance:

                min_balance = current

        R = max( -min_balance, 0 )

        sequences.append( (delta, R) )

    positive = [ (d, R) for d, R in sequences if d >=0 ]

    negative = [ (d, R) for d, R in sequences if d <0 ]

        # a and b are tuples (delta, R)

        val1 = max(a[1], b[1] - a[0])

        if val1 < val2:

            return -1

Another example: fourth input.

Input:

1

)(()

The sequence is ")(()".

The code computes:

Processing the sequence:

current starts at 0.

After ')': -1. min_balance -1.

After '(': 0. min_balance -1.

After '(': 1. min_balance -1.

After ')': 0. min_balance -1.

So delta is 0 (2 '(' and 2 ')'.

R is max( -(-1), 0 ) →1.

So the code processes this sequence.

Simulate:

current_balance is 0.

R is 1. current_balance >=1 → no. So processing stops. count is 0.

Which matches the fourth example.

Thus, the code seems to handle all examples correctly.

Now, the code is written and should be correct.
