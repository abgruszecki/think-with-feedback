Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to sum numbers given in a certain base and output the result in the same base. Hmm. So first, I need to read the inputs, convert each number from the given radix to a decimal (base 10) integer, sum them all, then convert the sum back to the original radix.

Wait, but converting each number to decimal might not be efficient if the numbers are very large. Oh wait, the problem says each element has between 1 and 5 digits. Let's think: maximum possible number per element. For example, in base 36, a 5-digit number would be ZZZZZ. Let's calculate what that is in decimal. Z is 35 in each digit. So 35*(36^4 + 36^3 + ... + 36^0). That's 35*( (36^5 -1)/(36-1) ) ≈ 35*(36^5/35) ) = 36^5 which is 60,466,176. So each number is up to around 60 million in decimal. And n is up to 10, so the total sum could be up to 600 million, which is manageable in Python's integers. So converting each to decimal, sum, then convert back to the base is feasible.

So the steps are:

1. Read n and radix.
2. Read each of the next n lines as a string.
3. Convert each string from base-radix to a decimal integer.
4. Sum all these integers.
5. Convert the sum back to the base-radix representation.
6. Output the result, ensuring leading zeros are removed, but if the sum is zero, output 0.

But how to handle the conversion. Let's see.

Converting from base-radix to decimal: for each digit in the string, multiply the current total by the radix and add the digit's value. For example, 'F0' in base 16 is F (15) * 16^1 + 0*16^0 = 240 + 0 = 240.

For conversion, the digits can be handled by checking if each character is a digit or a letter. So for a character c, its value is int(c) if it's a digit, else 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')). So for 'A' it's 10, 'B' 11, up to 'Z' 35.

So for the input string, we can process each character, build the decimal value. Then sum all the numbers.

Once we have the sum in decimal, we need to convert it back to the given radix.

Converting decimal to base-radix: repeatedly divide by the radix and collect the remainders. The remainders are the digits in reverse order. For example, if the sum is 767 (decimal) and radix 16: 767 /16 =47 rem 15 (F), then 47 /16=2 rem 15 (F), then 2/16=0 rem 2. So the result is 2FF.

But what about when the sum is zero? Then the conversion would produce no digits, so we need to handle that case and output '0'.

Now, handling leading zeros in the input. For example, the third input in the first example is '004' which is 4 in base 16. The output is '2FF' which has no leading zeros. So the output must not have leading zeros unless the sum is zero.

So the steps for conversion back to the base are:

- If sum is zero, output '0'.
- Else, build the digits by taking the remainder each time, then reverse them.
- For each remainder (digit), convert it to the appropriate character (0-9, then A-Z).

Now, how to handle the digits correctly. For example, when the remainder is 10, it should be 'A', 11 'B', up to 35 'Z'.

So in code:

For converting a digit value (0-35) to a character:

if value < 10: str(value)
else: chr(ord('A') + value -10)

So, during the conversion from decimal to the base, each remainder is mapped to the appropriate character.

Potential edge cases:

- Sum is zero.
- All input numbers are zero.
- Radix is 2, and the sum is something like 1 (should output '1').
- Leading zeros in input but sum is non-zero (output should not have leading zeros).

Testing the first example:

3
16
F0 (15*16 +0 =240)
20B (2*16² +0*16 +11 = 2*256 +0 +11= 512+11=523)
004 (4)
Sum is 240 +523 +4 = 767.

Convert 767 to base 16:

767 //16 =47 rem 15 (F)
47//16 =2 rem 15 (F)
2//16 =0 rem 2. So digits are 2, F, F → '2FF'.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input is 2 numbers in base 10: 12 +34 =46, output is '46'.

So code steps:

Read n, radix.

Read each of n lines, process each as a string. For each string, convert to decimal.

Sum them all.

Convert sum to base radix, then output.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, the function to convert a string in base radix to a decimal integer.

Let's write a helper function: str_to_num(s, radix).

But in Python, there's the int function with base. For example, int(s, base) can do this. But the problem is that the input strings can have uppercase letters (A-Z), which int can handle. So for example, int('F0', 16) gives 240, which is correct.

But wait, does the int function in Python allow for base 2-36? Yes. Because according to Python's docs, int(s, base) allows base 0 and 2-36. So if the string is in the correct format (digits 0-9, letters a-z or A-Z, but letters must represent values less than the base), then int(s, base) will work. But the problem says that the input numbers are valid in the given radix. So for example, in base 16, the input can have 'F0', which is valid. So we can use int(s, radix) directly.

Wait, but in Python, for the string 'F0' with base 16, int('F0', 16) will be 240. Yes. But what about letters like 'a'? Well, the problem says that the input uses uppercase letters. So the input will have 0-9 and A-Z. But the int function is case-insensitive. For example, int('f0',16) is the same as int('F0',16). So regardless of the case, it's handled. So since the problem specifies that the input uses uppercase letters, but even if some are lowercase, the code would still work. But according to the problem statement, the input uses 0-9 and uppercase letters, so we can safely use int(s, radix).

So the conversion from string to decimal is straightforward: just use int(s, radix). So each input line is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace (but the input may have leading zeros, which are allowed in the problem).

Then, sum all those numbers.

Then, convert the sum back to the base.

Now, converting the sum back to the base. For that, we need to handle 0 specially.

So code for converting a decimal number to a string in base radix:

def decimal_to_base(num, radix):
    if num == 0:
        return '0'
    digits = []
    while num > 0:
        remainder = num % radix
        char = str(remainder) if remainder <10 else chr(ord('A') + remainder -10)
        digits.append(char)
        num = num // radix
    # The digits are in reverse order
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))

But wait, what if the sum is zero? Then the function returns '0'.

So this should handle all cases.

So putting it all together:

Read n, radix.

sum_total = 0

for _ in range(n):
    s = input().strip()
    sum_total += int(s, radix)

Then, convert sum_total to base radix.

But in Python, for the input lines, we have to read each line. So for example, the third input line in the first example is '004', which is read as '004', which is 4 in base 16.

Yes.

Now, handling the sum correctly. Then converting to the base.

So the code structure is:

n = int(input())
radix = int(input())
total = 0
for _ in range(n):
    s = input().strip().upper()  # in case some lowercase letters are present, but problem says uppercase. Maybe not needed, but just to be safe.
    total += int(s, radix)

Then, output the conversion.

But wait, what if the sum is zero? The code would output '0' as required.

Testing the code.

First sample:

sum is 240 + 523 +4=767.

decimal_to_base(767, 16) should return '2FF'.

Let's see:

767 //16 =47, rem 15 (F)
47 //16 =2, rem 15 (F)
2//16 =0, rem 2.

digits are [F, F, 2], reversed becomes 2FF. So yes.

Second sample sum is 12 +34=46. Convert to base 10 is '46'.

Now, code.

Potential issues:

1. Leading zeros in the output. But the code's decimal_to_base function does not add leading zeros. For example, if the sum is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, removes leading zeros. So that's correct.

Another test case: sum is 0. Inputs all zero. Then output '0'.

Another test case: sum is 1 in base 2. Output '1'.

So the code should handle that.

Now, the code in Python:

Read n, radix.

Read n lines, sum the integers.

Convert sum to base radix.

So the code is as follows.

But what about the case when the sum is zero? Because when sum is zero, the code in decimal_to_base returns '0', which is correct.

Now, code:

n = int(input())
radix = int(input())
total = 0
for _ in range(n):
    s = input().strip().upper()
    total += int(s, radix)

if total == 0:
    print('0')
else:
    res = []
    while total > 0:
        rem = total % radix
        if rem <10:
            res.append(str(rem))
        else:
            res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))
        total = total // radix
    print(''.join(reversed(res)))

Wait, but in the code above, when total is zero, we handle it first. Otherwise, in the loop, total starts as positive and becomes zero. So the code should work.

But let's test with sum zero. For example, input:

1
10
0

Output should be 0. The code checks if total is zero and outputs '0' directly.

Yes.

Another test case: sum is zero, but after some divisions. But that can't happen. So the code is correct.

Wait, but what if the sum is zero, the code outputs '0' immediately, otherwise loops. So that's correct.

So this code should handle all cases.

But let's see. For example, in the first sample, the code would compute total=767, which is >0. Then, in the loop:

767 % 16 = 15 → 'F', 767//16=47.

47%16=15 → 'F', 47//16=2.

2%16=2 → '2', 2//16=0.

res is [F, F, 2], reversed → '2FF'.

Which is correct.

Another example: sum is 46 in base 10. The code's loop:

46%10=6 → '6', 46//10=4.

4%10=4 → '4', 4//10=0.

res is [6,4], reversed '46'.

Yes.

Another example: sum is 0. Then code outputs '0'.

Yes.

So this code should work.

Now, potential optimizations:

But since the input numbers are small (each up to 36^5), and n is up to 10, the sum is manageable as a Python integer, which can handle arbitrary sizes. So no problem with that.

What about leading zeros in the input? The code uses int(s, radix), which automatically ignores leading zeros. For example, '004' in base 16 is 4, which is correct.

Thus, the code is correct.

```python
n = int(input())
radix = int(input())
total = 0
for _ in range(n):
    s = input().strip().upper()
    total += int(s, radix)

if total == 0:
    print('0')
else:
    digits = []
    while total > 0:
        rem = total % radix
        if rem < 10:
            digits.append(str(rem))
        else:
            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))
        total //= radix
    print(''.join(reversed(digits)))
