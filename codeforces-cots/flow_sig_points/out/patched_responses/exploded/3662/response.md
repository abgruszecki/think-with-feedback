Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a given decimal number into its simple exponential notation. Let's think through the steps carefully.

First, let's understand the problem. The input is a string representing a positive decimal number. The output needs to be in the form aEb where a is between 1 and 10 (not including 10), and b is the exponent. But there are some edge cases: if b is zero, we omit the E part. Also, if a is an integer, like 2, then we write it as 2 instead of 2.0. And we have to remove any leading or trailing zeros that are unnecessary.

So the plan is to process the input string to find the significant digits and determine the exponent. Let's break this down into parts.

The input can have leading zeros, like "01.23400" which should become "1.234". The input can also be something like ".100" which is 0.1, so the exponential form is 1E-1. Or "100." which is 100, so 1E2.

First, I need to parse the input string into its normalized form. The steps I think are:

1. Remove leading and trailing zeros not needed.
2. Find the position of the decimal point if it exists.
3. Determine the significant digits (the part between leading and trailing zeros) and the exponent.

Let me think about how to handle different cases.

Case 1: The input is like "1234" → which is 1234. The normalized form is 1.234E3. So the exponent is 3, a is 1.234.

Case 2: "01.23400" → becomes 1.234 (since the exponent is 0, so E part is omitted). Because 1.234 * 10^0 is the same as 1.234.

Case 3: ".100" → this is 0.1, so normalized is 1E-1. The exponent here is -1.

Case 4: "100." → same as 100, so 1E2.

So the main steps are:

- Process the input string to find the significant digits (remove leading and trailing zeros).
- Determine the exponent based on the position of the first significant digit and the decimal point.

Let's think about how to process the input.

First, split the string into parts before and after the decimal point. If there's no decimal point, then the entire part is considered as the integer part.

But maybe a better approach is to find all the significant digits and track the position where they start and end.

For example, in "01.23400", the significant digits are '1234', but after the decimal, trailing zeros are removed. So the number is 1.234.

Wait, but how to handle leading and trailing zeros:

Leading zeros before the first non-zero digit in the integer part are ignored. Trailing zeros after the decimal point are also ignored. But if there is a decimal point, leading zeros after it (but before the first non-zero) are part of the exponent calculation.

For example, the input ".00123" is 0.00123, which is 1.23E-3.

So, the steps to process the input:

1. Remove any leading zeros before the first non-zero digit in the integer part (the part before the decimal point). Also, remove trailing zeros after the decimal point.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to find the first non-zero digit, then all digits from that point until the last non-zero digit. Then, track the position of the decimal point relative to this significant part to compute the exponent.

Let me outline the steps:

- The input string can start with zeros (like "000.123"), have a decimal point, and/or end with zeros (like "123.4500").

The first step is to split the input into integer_part and fractional_part. The integer_part is the part before the decimal, and fractional_part is after. If there's no decimal, then fractional_part is empty. If the input starts with a '.', like ".123", then the integer_part is empty. If the input ends with a '.', like "123.", then the fractional_part is empty.

Once we have the integer and fractional parts, we need to find the first non-zero digit. For example:

Case 1: Input is "00123.4500"

Integer part is "00123", fractional is "4500".

The first non-zero in integer_part is at index 2 (assuming 0-based, "0", "0", "1" is the third character). But maybe the first non-zero in the entire number is in the integer_part. But if the integer part is all zeros, then look into the fractional_part.

Alternatively, the first non-zero digit can be in the integer part or the fractional part. So the first step is to find the position of the first non-zero digit in the entire number.

Once we find the first non-zero digit, we can determine the significant digits.

Then, the significant digits are all the digits starting from the first non-zero to the last non-zero in the entire number. For example:

In "00123.4500", the significant digits are 12345. The last non-zero is the 5 in the fractional part.

Once we have the significant digits (as a string), we need to form 'a' such that 1 ≤ a <10. So 'a' is the first digit, followed by a decimal point and the remaining digits, unless there's only one digit (then no decimal point). Then, the exponent is determined based on the original position of the first non-zero digit and the decimal point.

The exponent calculation depends on where the first non-zero digit is located.

For example:

Take the example ".100". The input is 0.100. The first non-zero is the '1' in the fractional part. The significant digits are '1'. The original position is after the decimal, so the exponent is (position of '1' in fractional part - 1) negative. Since the '1' is the first digit after the decimal (position 0?), perhaps the exponent is - (position + 1).

Wait, maybe the exponent calculation is:

The original number can be written as a * 10^b. We need to determine b.

Suppose the original number is N. The normalized form is N = a * 10^b, where 1 ≤ a < 10.

So for example:

In the case of ".100" → N is 0.1. The normalized form is 1 * 10^(-1). So exponent is -1.

In the case of "01.23400" → N is 1.234. So exponent is 0. So the output is 1.234.

In the case of "100." → N is 100 → 1 * 10^2 → exponent 2.

So how to compute the exponent:

The exponent depends on how the first non-zero digit's position relates to the decimal point.

Let me model the problem.

Let's consider the input as a sequence of digits with a possible decimal point. The first non-zero digit's position determines the leading part.

The steps:

1. Find the first non-zero digit in the entire number. Let's call its index 'first_non_zero_pos'.

   For example:

   Input: "001.234" → first_non_zero_pos is in the integer part, at position 2 (0-based, considering the digits before the decimal point as a list).

   Input: ".00123" → first_non_zero_pos is at position 2 in the fractional part (digits after the decimal point, index starts at 0).

2. Determine the position of the decimal point relative to the first non-zero digit.

The exponent is calculated as follows:

If the first non-zero digit is in the integer part (i.e., left of the decimal point):

The exponent is (number of digits in the integer part before the first_non_zero digit) + (number of digits in the integer part after the first_non_zero digit) - 1.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think. For example, integer part is 00123. The first non-zero is at index 2 (digits are 0,0,1,2,3). The decimal point is after the integer part (if there is one). The number is 123. So in normalized form, it's 1.23E2. The exponent is (length of the integer part after leading zeros minus 1). Wait, 123 has 3 digits. The exponent is 2 (since 123 = 1.23 * 10^2).

But how to compute the exponent when the first non-zero is in the integer part.

Alternatively, when the first non-zero digit is in the integer part (the part before the decimal point):

The number of digits between the first non-zero digit (inclusive) and the end of the integer part is the number of digits contributing to the exponent. For example, in 00123.45, the first non-zero is at position 2 (0-based) in the integer part. The integer part is "00123", which is 5 digits. So the digits after the first non-zero are positions 2,3,4 → '123'. So the exponent is 2 (since 3-1 digits → 2). Wait, 123.45 is 1.2345E2. So the exponent is 2.

So the exponent in this case is (number of digits in the integer part after the first non-zero digit (inclusive) - 1) + (number of digits after the decimal point that are part of the significant digits).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, when the first non-zero is in the integer part, the decimal point is either after the integer part (like 123.45) or not present (like 12345).

In either case, the position of the first non-zero digit in the integer part determines how many digits are to the left of the decimal in the normalized form.

For example:

Original number: 123.45 → normalized form is 1.2345E2. The exponent is 2, which is the number of digits after the first non-zero (including it) minus 1. The first non-zero is the first digit (1). The integer part is 123 → 3 digits. So 3-1 = 2.

Another example: 000123 → becomes 1.23E2. The exponent is 2.

So, in the case where the first non-zero is in the integer part, the exponent is (number of digits from first non-zero to the end of the integer part minus 1) plus the number of digits in the fractional part that are part of the significant digits. Wait, but the significant digits include the fractional part's digits.

Hmm, maybe the exponent calculation is:

If the first non-zero is in the integer part, then the exponent is (position of the first non-zero in the integer part) + (number of digits in the integer part after the first non-zero) + (number of digits in the fractional part that are part of the significant digits) - 1. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is (number of digits between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit's original position). Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think of the general approach.

We have to represent the original number as a * 10^b, where a is between 1 and 10. So a is a number with exactly one digit before the decimal point, followed by any remaining digits (if any).

The exponent 'b' is determined by how many positions we moved the decimal point to get to a.

For example, if the original number is 123.45, the decimal point is moved left by 2 positions to get 1.2345, so the exponent is +2.

If the original number is 0.00123, the decimal point is moved right by 3 positions to get 1.23, so the exponent is -3.

So the exponent 'b' is the number of positions the decimal point was moved. If moving left, exponent increases (positive), moving right, exponent decreases (negative).

So the steps to compute 'b' are:

1. Find the position of the first non-zero digit.

2. Determine where the decimal point is in relation to this first digit.

Let me model the problem with the input as a string. For example:

Case 1: Input is "00123.45"

The first non-zero is at index 2 in the integer part (digits are 0,0,1,2,3). The decimal is after the integer part. The original number is 123.45.

The decimal point is after the integer part. The first digit is 1 (position 0 in the integer part, but the actual position is after two leading zeros). Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider the entire number as a sequence of digits, ignoring leading and trailing zeros, and track the original decimal point's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to find the first non-zero digit's position in the entire string (ignoring any leading zeros and any leading '.' if present). Then, the exponent is determined by how many places the decimal needs to move to get from that position to the first digit of 'a'.

Let me think of the input as a sequence of characters. Let's process it:

For example, input is "00123.45" → after trimming leading zeros (but wait, leading zeros before the first non-zero in the integer part may not all be removed. Wait, perhaps we need to process the entire input as is, but ignoring leading zeros in the integer part and leading zeros in the fractional part before the first non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Split the input into two parts: left and right of the decimal point.

- The left part is the integer part (could be empty if the input starts with '.').

- The right part is the fractional part (could be empty if the input ends with '.').

Now, process the integer and fractional parts to find the first non-zero digit.

For example:

In the integer part "00123", the first non-zero is at index 2 (digit '1').

In the fractional part "4500", the first non-zero is at index 0 (digit '4') but if the integer part is all zeros, then the first non-zero may be in the fractional part.

Once we find the first non-zero digit in either part, we can compute the exponent.

So, here's the plan:

1. Remove leading zeros from the integer part. For example, "00123" becomes "123".

But wait, if the integer part is "000" and the fractional part is "123", then the first non-zero is in the fractional part.

So, the steps are:

- Remove leading zeros in the integer part until the first non-zero digit. If all are zeros, then the integer part becomes empty.

- Remove trailing zeros in the fractional part after the last non-zero digit. If all are zeros, the fractional part becomes empty.

Wait, but the problem is that leading zeros in the integer part and leading zeros in the fractional part (before the first non-zero) are part of the exponent calculation. For example, ".00123" → the first non-zero is in the third position of the fractional part. The exponent is -3.

So, perhaps the steps are:

Find the first non-zero digit in the entire number. Let's call its position 'first_pos'.

If the first non-zero is in the integer part:

   The number of digits from that position to the end of the integer part (including it) is the length of the integer part minus the index of the first non-zero digit.

   The exponent is (number of digits after first non-zero in integer part) + (number of digits in fractional part) → no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps after finding the first non-zero in the integer part, the exponent is (original position of the decimal point relative to the first non-zero digit) minus 1.

Alternatively, the exponent is (number of digits in the integer part starting from the first non-zero digit minus 1) plus the number of digits in the fractional part that are part of the significant digits.

Hmm, maybe the exponent calculation is the following:

The original number can be viewed as a sequence of significant digits S starting with the first non-zero and ending with the last non-zero. The decimal point is at some position relative to these digits.

The exponent is the number of positions the decimal point must be moved to the left or right to get a single non-zero digit before the decimal point.

For example:

Original number: 123.45 → decimal point after 3 digits. To get 1.2345, the decimal is moved left by 2 positions → exponent +2.

Original number: 0.00123 → decimal is after 0 digits (fractional part starts with 0s). The first non-zero is at position 2 (third character). The decimal is moved right by 3 positions (so 00123 becomes 1.23, but the original decimal was at position 0, moving right 3 → exponent -3).

So, the exponent is determined by where the decimal point is relative to the first non-zero digit.

So, the algorithm steps:

1. Process the input string to split into integer and fractional parts.

   - Split on '.' if present. If not present, integer part is the entire string, fractional part is empty.

   - If the input starts with '.', integer part is empty, fractional part is the rest.

   - If the input ends with '.', fractional part is empty.

2. Find the first non-zero digit in the entire number.

   - Check the integer part. If it's not empty, find the first non-zero. If found, that's the first non-zero digit.

   - If the integer part is all zeros, then check the fractional part for the first non-zero digit.

3. Once the first non-zero is found, determine the position of the decimal point relative to it.

   - For example, if the first non-zero is in the integer part at position i (0-based), then the original decimal point is after the integer part. So, moving the decimal point left by (number of digits from i to end of integer part -1) gives the exponent.

   - If the first non-zero is in the fractional part at position j (0-based), then the exponent is -(j + 1). Because moving the decimal right by j+1 positions to get 1.x... .

4. Collect all the significant digits (from first non-zero to last non-zero in the entire number).

   - The significant digits are the digits from first non-zero onwards, including any non-zero digits in the integer and fractional parts, trimming trailing zeros.

5. Form the 'a' part:

   - The first digit is the first non-zero digit.

   - The remaining digits are added after the decimal point, if any.

   - If there are no remaining digits, then 'a' is written as an integer (without decimal point).

   - If there are remaining digits, they are added after the decimal point, and trailing zeros are removed.

Wait, but trailing zeros in the significant digits would have been already removed. For example, in "123.45000", the significant digits are 12345, with trailing zeros in the fractional part. Wait, but the problem says to not have trailing zeros. So after processing, the significant digits are 12345 (the trailing zeros in the fractional part are removed).

But how to process that.

So, after finding the significant digits (all from first non-zero to last non-zero in the original number), we can process those digits as follows:

The 'a' part is formed as:

- The first digit.

- If there are more digits, then a decimal point followed by the remaining digits (without trailing zeros).

So, for example, if the significant digits are '1234', then 'a' is '1.234'. If the significant digits are '1', then 'a' is '1'.

So, the steps for forming 'a' are:

1. Take the first digit of the significant digits.

2. Take the remaining digits (if any) and trim any trailing zeros.

3. If there are any non-zero digits left after trimming, append a decimal point followed by those digits. Otherwise, just the first digit.

So, for example:

Significant digits '1000' → '1' (since trailing zeros are removed). So 'a' is '1'.

Significant digits '1230' → '1230' → after trimming trailing zeros, '123' → '1.23'.

Wait, but the significant digits are '1230' → after the first digit, the rest are '230'. Trimming trailing zeros gives '23'. So 'a' would be '1.23'.

So the code for forming 'a' is:

a = [first_digit]

remaining = significant_digits[1:].lstrip('0') → no, wait, the remaining digits can have zeros in the middle, but trailing zeros are to be removed.

Wait, the significant digits are all digits from the first non-zero to the last non-zero (so trailing zeros have already been stripped). So, for example, in the input '01.23400', the significant digits are '1234'.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The input is '01.23400' → integer part is '01', which after removing leading zeros becomes '1'. Fractional part is '23400' → after trimming trailing zeros becomes '234'. So the significant digits are '1234' → leading '1' from integer, then '234' from fractional. So the significant digits are '1234'.

So, the code must collect all the digits after the first non-zero (including it) up to the last non-zero digit in the entire number.

So the steps are:

1. Split the input into integer_part and fractional_part.

2. For integer_part: strip leading zeros. If all zeros, becomes empty.

3. For fractional_part: strip trailing zeros. If all zeros, becomes empty.

4. Find the first non-zero digit:

   a. If integer_part is not empty, first_non_zero is the first character of the stripped integer_part.

   b. Else, look in the stripped fractional_part. The first non-zero is the first character of the stripped fractional_part.

5. Once the first_non_zero is found, collect all digits from that point onward from both parts, until the last non-zero in the entire number.

Wait, but how? Let's see:

If the first_non_zero is in the integer_part (stripped), then all digits in the integer_part (stripped) are part of the significant digits. Then, the fractional_part (stripped) is also part of the significant digits (since trailing zeros were removed, so any digits in the stripped fractional part are non-zero and part of the significant digits).

If the first_non_zero is in the fractional_part (stripped), then all digits in the fractional_part (stripped) are part of the significant digits, starting from the first_non_zero. The integer_part (stripped) is empty, so no digits there.

Wait, perhaps the significant digits are:

stripped_integer_part + stripped_fractional_part.

But that's not correct. Because if the stripped_integer_part is non-empty, then it's part of the significant digits, and the stripped_fractional_part is also part (since trailing zeros are removed). So combining them gives all the significant digits.

But if the stripped_integer_part is empty, then the stripped_fractional_part is the significant digits.

For example, input ".100" → stripped_integer is empty, stripped_fractional is '1' (since leading zeros are kept, but we stripped trailing zeros. Wait, no: the original input is ".100". The fractional_part is "100". After stripping trailing zeros, it's "1". So stripped_fractional_part is "1". So the significant digits are "1".

Another example: "01.23400" → stripped_integer is "1", stripped_fractional is "234". So significant digits are "1234".

So the significant digits are stripped_integer_part + stripped_fractional_part.

But this only works if the stripped_integer_part is not empty. Wait no: if the input is "000123", then stripped_integer is "123", stripped_fractional is empty. So significant digits are "123".

If input is "0.000123", stripped_integer is empty, stripped_fractional is "000123" → no, wait, in this case, the original fractional_part is "000123". After stripping trailing zeros, it would remain "000123" because trailing zeros are after the non-zero digits. Wait, no. Wait, trailing zeros in the fractional_part are the ones after the last non-zero digit. So in "000123", the trailing zeros would be any zeros after the '3'? No, the original input is ".000123", fractional_part is "000123". The stripped fractional_part is "000123", but that's not right. Because leading zeros in the fractional_part are part of the exponent calculation, but the trailing zeros (those after the last non-zero) are stripped.

Wait, perhaps the way to process the fractional_part is to remove trailing zeros. So, for example, "4500" → becomes "45". "000123" → after trailing stripping, becomes "000123" (since trailing zeros are after the last non-zero, but in this case, the last non-zero is '3', so trailing zeros would be after that. So if the fractional_part is "000123", there are no trailing zeros, so it remains "000123". But that's not right. Wait, the input ".000123" has leading zeros in the fractional part, but they are not trailing. So the stripped_fractional_part is "000123" → but the trailing zeros are not present here. So, in this case, the fractional_part is "000123" → after stripping trailing zeros (if any), but there are none here. So the stripped_fractional_part is "000123". But this is leading zeros, which are not trailing. So how to process this.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in how to process the fractional_part. For the fractional_part, trailing zeros are zeros that come after the last non-zero digit. So in the fractional_part, we need to remove those trailing zeros. So for example, "4500" → becomes "45". "000123000" → becomes "000123" (trailing zeros after '3' are removed). But leading zeros in the fractional_part are not stripped. So in ".000123", the fractional_part after stripping trailing zeros is "000123".

But in that case, when the integer_part is empty, and the stripped fractional_part is "000123", the first non-zero is at position 3 (0-based), which is the '1' in "000123".

But in this case, the significant digits are '123'.

Wait, but the original input is ".000123", which is 0.000123. The significant digits are 1,2,3. So why are the leading zeros in the fractional_part not part of the significant digits?

Because leading zeros before the first non-zero in the fractional_part are not significant. So the significant digits start from the first non-zero in the entire number.

Ah, right. So the process is:

1. Split the input into integer_part and fractional_part.

2. Process the integer_part and fractional_part:

   a. For the integer_part: strip leading zeros. So "00123" → "123", "0000" → "".

   b. For the fractional_part: strip trailing zeros. So "4500" → "45", "000" → "", "000123" → "000123" (since the trailing zeros are after the '3').

Wait, but "000123" as the fractional_part would have trailing zeros after the '3'? No. If the fractional_part is "000123", the trailing zeros are the ones after the last non-zero digit. Here, the last non-zero is '3', so there are no trailing zeros after it. So the stripped fractional_part would be "000123".

But in reality, the significant digits are '123', because the leading zeros are not part of them. So the problem is that in the processing steps, we need to first find the first non-zero digit in the entire number, then collect all digits from there to the last non-zero digit in the entire number.

So perhaps the steps are:

After splitting into integer_part and fractional_part:

Process the integer_part by removing leading zeros. So if the integer_part was "00123", it becomes "123". If it was "000", it becomes "".

Process the fractional_part by removing trailing zeros. So if it was "4500", it becomes "45". If it was "000", it becomes "".

Now, concatenate the processed integer_part and the processed fractional_part. The combined string is the digits that are not leading or trailing zeros (but may have leading zeros in the fractional_part if the first non-zero is in the fractional_part).

Then, find the first non-zero in the combined string (since processed integer_part may be empty if all zeros, and processed fractional_part may have leading zeros if there were leading zeros in the original fractional_part that were not trailing).

Wait, no. Because processed integer_part is stripped of leading zeros, so if it's not empty, it starts with a non-zero. The processed fractional_part is stripped of trailing zeros. So for example:

Input: "01.23400" → processed integer_part is "1", fractional_part is "234". Combined string is "1234".

Input: ".0012300" → processed integer_part is "", fractional_part is "00123". Combined string is "00123".

But in this case, the first non-zero is at position 2 (the '1' in "00123").

So the steps are:

1. Split into integer_part and fractional_part.

2. Process integer_part: strip leading zeros → new_integer.

3. Process fractional_part: strip trailing zeros → new_fraction.

4. Combine new_integer and new_fraction → combined_digits.

5. If combined_digits is empty → the number is zero. But according to the problem statement, x is positive, so this can't happen.

6. Find the first occurrence of a non-zero in combined_digits → index f.

   Since new_integer is stripped of leading zeros, if it's not empty, then combined_digits starts with a non-zero. So in this case, f is 0.

   If new_integer is empty, then combined_digits is new_fraction (stripped of trailing zeros), which may have leading zeros (from original fractional_part). So in that case, f is the index of the first non-zero in new_fraction.

7. The significant digits are combined_digits[f:] → but that's not correct. Because the combined_digits may have leading zeros from the fractional_part, which are part of the exponent calculation but not part of the significant digits.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The combined_digits is the concatenation of new_integer (stripped of leading zeros) and new_fraction (stripped of trailing zeros). But new_fraction may have leading zeros if the original fractional_part had leading zeros before the first non-zero digit. For example, in input ".00123", new_fraction is "00123", so combined_digits is "00123" (since new_integer is empty). The first non-zero in combined_digits is at index 2.

The significant digits start from that first non-zero (including it) and include all digits until the end of combined_digits.

So the significant digits are combined_digits[f:] → in the example, "123".

So:

significant_digits = combined_digits[f:]

But combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction.

Once we have the significant digits, we can form 'a' as:

a = significant_digits[0] + ('.' + significant_digits[1:].rstrip('0')) if len(significant_digits) > 1.

Wait, but significant_digits may have trailing zeros if there are digits after the first non-zero. For example, combined_digits could be "100", which after f=0, significant_digits is "100" → then 'a' is "1.00"? But according to the problem statement, we should not have trailing zeros in 'a'.

Wait, but the significant_digits are all digits from the first non-zero to the last non-zero in the original number. So the significant_digits should not have trailing zeros. So how is "100" possible?

Because in the original number, those zeros are not trailing. For example, input "100" → new_integer is "100", new_fraction is empty. combined_digits is "100". The first non-zero is index 0. significant_digits is "100". The last non-zero is index 2. So trailing zeros would be any zeros after that. So the significant_digits are "100", which has no trailing zeros. So in this case, 'a' would be '1.00'? But according to the problem statement, a should not have trailing zeros. So the code needs to remove trailing zeros in the fractional part of 'a'.

So, after getting the significant digits (like '1230'), which is possible if the original input is "0.1230", then the significant digits would be '1230' (because new_integer is empty, new_fraction is '1230' (after stripping trailing zeros in the original fractional part, which would have trailing zeros after '3', but in this case, if the original was '1230', then stripping trailing zeros would result in '123'). So perhaps my previous model is wrong.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the steps.

Original input is "0.1230":

integer_part is '0', processed (stripped leading zeros) becomes empty.

fractional_part is '1230', processed (stripped trailing zeros) becomes '123'.

combined_digits is empty + '123' → '123'.

significant_digits is '123' → 'a' is '1.23'.

But the original input is 0.1230 → 0.123, which is 1.23 * 10^-1. So the code would correctly output '1.23E-1'.

Another example: input is "100.", which becomes new_integer '100', new_fraction ''. combined_digits is '100'. first_non_zero is 0. significant_digits is '100' → 'a' is '1.00' → but according to the problem statement, if 'a' is an integer (like 100 → 1.00E2 → but a is 1.00, which is written as 1E2).

Wait, no. Wait, 100 is 1 * 10^2. So 'a' is 1. So the code must output '1E2'.

But according to the significant_digits '100', how is 'a' formed?

Significant_digits are '100', so the first digit is '1', followed by '00'. So the code would form '1.00' → but according to the problem statement, if a is an integer (i.e., after the decimal point there are no digits), then we should write it without the decimal point. So, if the significant_digits after the first digit are all zeros and they are stripped, then 'a' is written as an integer.

Wait, the problem says:

"If a is an integer, it should be written without decimal point. Also there should not be extra zeroes in a and b."

So, 'a' must be written as an integer only if it's an integer, i.e., if after the decimal point there are no digits (or all zeros, which are removed).

So for example:

Significant_digits is '1' → 'a' is '1'.

Significant_digits is '12' → '1.2'.

Significant_digits is '10' → '1.0' → but trailing zero after decimal should be stripped, so '1'.

So, after collecting the significant_digits, when forming 'a', we need to take the first digit, then the rest, trimming any trailing zeros. If the rest (after trimming) is empty, then no decimal point. Otherwise, the trimmed rest after decimal.

So:

digits = significant_digits

if len(digits) == 1:

   a_str = digits[0]

else:

   remaining = digits[1:].rstrip('0')  # remove trailing zeros

   if remaining:

       a_str = digits[0] + '.' + remaining

   else:

       a_str = digits[0]

So, for significant_digits '100' → digits[0] is '1', digits[1:] is '00'. rstrip('0') gives ''. So a_str is '1'.

Another example: '1230' → digits[1:] is '230' → rstrip → '23' → a_str is '1.23'.

So this way, trailing zeros in the remaining digits are removed.

So the code for forming 'a' is:

digits = significant_digits

if len(digits) == 1:

   a_part = digits

else:

   rest = digits[1:].lstrip('0')  # No, wait. Wait, digits[1:] is the part after the first digit. We need to take all digits after the first, and then remove trailing zeros. Because the significant_digits has no trailing zeros (since combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction, which have been stripped of trailing zeros in the fractional_part). Wait, perhaps the significant_digits is the part from first non-zero to the last non-zero in the entire number. So digits[1:] may have trailing zeros if those zeros are part of the significant digits. For example, input "100." → combined_digits is '100' (new_integer is '100', new_fraction is empty). significant_digits is '100', so digits[1:] is '00'. rstrip('0') is '', so a_str is '1'.

Thus, the code correctly handles that case.

Now, the next part is to compute the exponent 'b'.

The exponent is determined by the original position of the decimal point relative to the first non-zero digit.

Let's see:

Case 1: The first non-zero is in the integer part (new_integer is not empty).

The original decimal point was after the integer_part. So, the original number is (new_integer + new_fraction) * 10^ (number of digits in new_fraction - len(new_fraction)).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's model this.

If the first non-zero is in the integer part (new_integer is not empty), then the decimal point is after the new_integer. For example, "123.45" → new_integer is '123', new_fraction is '45'. The original decimal is after '123'.

The normalized form is 1.2345 * 10^(2). The exponent is 2, which is (length of new_integer - 1) + len(new_fraction). Because new_integer is '123' (3 digits), so the decimal was moved left by 2 positions (3-1) to get to 1.2345. The new_fraction adds len(new_fraction) digits. So the exponent is (3-1) + 0 (since the decimal point is already after the new_integer, and moving left by (3-1) positions gives the exponent).

Wait, perhaps the exponent is the number of positions the decimal point has to be moved left from its original position to the position after the first digit.

In the example of "123.45", the original decimal is after the integer part (after '123'). To form 'a', the decimal is moved left by two positions (from 123.45 → 1.2345). So exponent is +2.

So the exponent is (number of digits in new_integer - 1) + len(new_fraction).

Wait, new_integer is '123' → 3 digits. (3-1) is 2. new_fraction is '45' → len is 2. So total exponent is 2 + 2 =4? That's not right. Because the original number is 123.45, which is 1.2345 * 10^2. So exponent is 2.

So the formula is (number of digits in new_integer - 1) → 3-1=2. len(new_fraction) is 2, but that's part of the a's decimal digits. So the exponent is (number of digits in new_integer -1) plus the number of digits in new_fraction? That's not correct.

Wait, no. The original decimal is after the new_integer. So, the number is new_integer + '.' + new_fraction. But since new_integer is '123' and new_fraction is '45', it's 123.45. The exponent is 2 (because you move the decimal left by two positions to get 1.2345).

So the exponent is (length of new_integer - 1). Because the decimal is after the new_integer, which is 3 digits long. Moving left by two positions gives the exponent 2.

But new_fraction's digits are part of the 'a' value, but they don't affect the exponent. Because the decimal is moved left by (length of new_integer -1) positions, regardless of the new_fraction's length.

So in the case of new_integer is '123' (3 digits), exponent is 3-1=2. The new_fraction is '45' (2 digits), but they are part of 'a' as 1.2345. So the exponent is 2.

So the formula is:

If the first non-zero is in new_integer (i.e., new_integer is not empty):

exponent = (number of digits in new_integer) - 1 + len(new_fraction)

Wait, no. Because new_integer is the processed integer_part (stripped of leading zeros). For example, new_integer '123' is 3 digits. The original number is 123.45. To get to 1.2345, we move the decimal left by two positions. So exponent is 2. len(new_fraction) is 2. But 3-1 + 2 =4, which is not correct.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

The original number is (new_integer + '.' + new_fraction) → after processing.

For example, if new_integer is '123' and new_fraction is '45', the number is 123.45.

The normalized form is a * 10^b, where a is 1.2345. The exponent b is the number of positions the decimal was moved left from its original position (after new_integer) to after the first digit.

In this case, the decimal was moved left by 2 positions (from 123.45 → 1.2345). So exponent is 2.

The number of digits in new_integer is 3. So 3-1=2. So the exponent is (number of digits in new_integer -1).

The new_fraction's digits are part of 'a' but don't affect the exponent. Because moving the decimal left by 2 positions already includes all digits in new_integer and new_fraction.

So the formula for the exponent when first non-zero is in new_integer is:

exponent = (len(new_integer) - 1) + len(new_fraction)

Wait, no. Because in the example 123.45 → len(new_integer) is 3, len(new_fraction) is 2. (3-1) + 2 = 4 → but exponent is 2. So this can't be.

So I must have a mistake here.

Alternative approach: the exponent is the number of positions the decimal point has to be moved left from its original position to get to the desired a.

Original decimal point is after the new_integer. So for new_integer of length L, the original decimal is at position L (if the number was written as new_integer followed by new_fraction, with the decimal between them). For example, new_integer is '123' (length 3), new_fraction is '45' (length 2). Original decimal is after 3 digits → the original number is 123.45.

To get a in the form 1.2345, the decimal is moved left by (L-1) positions. So exponent is (L-1) = 3-1=2.

The new_fraction's digits are added after the decimal point, but they don't affect the exponent. Because their presence just adds more digits to 'a', but the exponent is determined by how many positions the decimal was moved.

So the formula for exponent when first non-zero is in new_integer is:

exponent = len(new_integer) - 1.

But what if new_integer is '123' and new_fraction is '45'? Then the exponent is 2. So the formula holds.

Another example: new_integer is '1' (len 1), new_fraction is '2345' (len 4). Original number is 1.2345. The exponent is 0 (since len(new_integer) -1 = 0). So the normalized form is 1.2345E0 → but according to the problem statement, if the exponent is zero, we omit the E part. So the output is 1.2345.

Which is correct.

Another example: new_integer is '12', new_fraction is '34'. Original number is 12.34. Normalized form is 1.234E1. Exponent is len(12)-1 = 2-1=1. So yes.

So the formula for exponent when first non-zero is in new_integer is:

exponent = len(new_integer) -1.

But what about the new_fraction? It's added to the significant digits but doesn't affect the exponent.

Yes, because moving the decimal left by (L-1) positions in the new_integer brings it to the first digit, and the new_fraction's digits are added after the decimal point in 'a'.

So, for the case where the first non-zero is in new_integer:

exponent = len(new_integer) -1.

Now, the other case: the first non-zero is in new_fraction. That is, new_integer is empty (all leading zeros in integer part were stripped) and new_fraction is not empty.

For example, input ".00123" → new_integer is "", new_fraction is "00123" (since trailing zeros were stripped if any, but in this case the original fractional_part is "00123" and trailing zeros are after the '3' → but there are none. So new_fraction is "00123".

The combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction → "00123". The first non-zero is at index 2 (the '1'). The significant_digits is "123".

The original decimal point is at position 0 (before the new_fraction). The exponent is computed by how many positions you need to move the decimal to the right to get to the first non-zero.

In this example, the first non-zero is at index 2 of the new_fraction. So to get to the normalized form (1.23), you move the decimal point 3 positions to the right (from 0.00123 → 1.23). So exponent is -3.

So the exponent is -(position of first non-zero in new_fraction + 1). Because:

In new_fraction, the first non-zero is at index j. The number of positions to move the decimal to the right is j+1.

For example, new_fraction is "00123", first non-zero at index 2 (0-based), positions to move is 3. So exponent is -3.

So the formula for the exponent when first non-zero is in new_fraction is:

exponent = -( (j) + 1 )

But j is the index within new_fraction. Because new_fraction is stripped of trailing zeros. So the significant_digits start at j.

Wait, but combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction. But new_integer is empty, so combined_digits is new_fraction. The first non-zero in combined_digits is at index j. So j is the index in new_fraction.

So the formula is:

exponent = -(j + 1).

For example:

j=2 → exponent -3.

So the code steps are:

if new_integer is not empty:

   exponent = len(new_integer) -1

else:

   exponent = - (f + 1) where f is the index of the first non-zero in combined_digits (which is new_fraction).

Wait, combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction. If new_integer is empty, then combined_digits is new_fraction. So in that case, f is the index of the first non-zero in new_fraction.

So in the case of new_integer empty:

exponent = - (f + 1).

Yes.

So, putting it all together:

The code steps:

1. Read the input string.

2. Split into integer_part and fractional_part.

   a. If '.' is present, split into two parts. Otherwise, integer_part is the entire string, fractional_part is empty.

3. Process integer_part:

   a. Strip leading zeros. If result is empty, set to empty string.

4. Process fractional_part:

   a. Strip trailing zeros. If result is empty, set to empty string.

5. Combine new_integer and new_fraction → combined_digits.

6. Find the first non-zero in combined_digits. The index is f.

7. significant_digits = combined_digits[f:]

8. Form a_part:

   a. If len(significant_digits) ==1: a_str = significant_digits[0]

   b. Else:

      i. rest = significant_digits[1:].rstrip('0')

      ii. if rest: a_str = significant_digits[0] + '.' + rest

      iii. else: a_str = significant_digits[0]

9. Compute exponent:

   a. if new_integer is not empty:

      exponent = len(new_integer) -1

   b. else:

      exponent = - (f + 1)

10. Output:

   a. If exponent ==0: output a_str

   b. Else: output a_str + 'E' + str(exponent)

But wait, how do we determine if new_integer is empty?

In step 3a, after stripping leading zeros, new_integer is empty if the original integer_part was all zeros. So new_integer is empty implies that the first non-zero is in new_fraction.

So, in code, the steps are manageable.

Now, let's test with examples.

Example 1:

Input: "16" → output "1.6E1"

Processing:

integer_part is "16", fractional_part is empty.

Process integer_part: strip leading zeros → "16"

Process fractional_part: strip trailing zeros → ""

combined_digits = "16" + "" = "16"

first_non_zero index f=0 (since combined_digits starts with '1').

significant_digits = "16" → a_str: len(2) >1. rest is '6' (rstrip). a_str is '1.6'.

exponent: new_integer is not empty → len("16") -1 = 1.

So output is '1.6E1' → correct.

Example 2:

Input: "01.23400" → output "1.234"

Processing:

integer_part is "01", processed → strip leading zeros → "1".

fractional_part is "23400" → strip trailing zeros → "234".

combined_digits = "1" + "234" → "1234".

first_non_zero is at f=0.

significant_digits is "1234".

a_str: len(4) → rest is "234" → '1.234'.

exponent: new_integer is "1" (len 1) → exponent 0. So output is '1.234' → correct.

Example 3:

Input: ".100" → output "1E-1"

Processing:

integer_part is empty → processed as empty.

fractional_part is "100" → strip trailing zeros → "1".

combined_digits is "1".

first_non_zero is f=0.

exponent: new_integer is empty → -(0+1) = -1.

a_str is '1'.

Output: '1E-1' → correct.

Example 4:

Input: "100." → output "1E2".

Processing:

integer_part is "100" → processed → "100".

fractional_part is "" → processed → "".

combined_digits = "100".

first_non_zero is 0.

significant_digits is "100".

a_str: len(3) → rest is "00". rstrip → "". So a_str is '1'.

exponent: len(new_integer) -1 → 3-1 = 2.

Output: '1E2' → correct.

Another example: input "0.0012300" → after processing, integer_part is empty, fractional_part is "00123".

combined_digits is "00123".

first_non_zero is at index 2 (since "00123" → first '1' at index 2).

significant_digits is "123".

a_str: '1.23'.

exponent: new_integer is empty → exponent = -(2+1) = -3.

Output: '1.23E-3'.

Another example: input "0.000" → but wait, input is a positive number. So this case is not possible. The input must have at least one non-zero digit.

So the code can assume that after processing, combined_digits is non-empty.

Now, coding this.

But how to handle the splitting of integer and fractional parts.

In Python:

s = input().strip()

if '.' in s:

    integer_part, fractional_part = s.split('.', 1)

else:

    integer_part = s

    fractional_part = ''

Process integer_part:

new_integer = integer_part.lstrip('0') or '0' → no, wait. Because if the integer_part is '000', then lstrip('0') becomes '', but that's not correct. For example, input '000.123' → integer_part is '000', new_integer is ''.

But according to the processing steps, new_integer is stripped of leading zeros. So in code:

new_integer = integer_part.lstrip('0')

But if integer_part is '0', new_integer is ''. So in that case, if the integer_part is '0', new_integer is ''. But if the entire integer_part is zeros, then new_integer is empty.

But for code:

new_integer = integer_part.lstrip('0')

if not new_integer and (len(integer_part) >0):

    # means integer_part was all zeros. But when you strip leading zeros, it becomes empty.

    # So, new_integer is empty.

else:

    pass

Similarly, fractional_part:

new_fraction = fractional_part.rstrip('0') or ''

So code:

new_fraction = fractional_part.rstrip('0') if fractional_part else ''

Wait, for example, fractional_part is '000' → stripped to ''.

Then, combined_digits is new_integer + new_fraction.

But how to find the first non-zero digit in combined_digits.

For example, if new_integer is empty and new_fraction is '00123', then combined_digits is '00123', first_non_zero is at index 2.

So code:

combined = new_integer + new_fraction

f = 0

if len(combined) == 0:

    # impossible, since x is positive

    pass

else:

    for i, c in enumerate(combined):

        if c != '0':

            f = i

            break

So f is the index of the first non-zero in combined.

Then, significant_digits = combined[f:]

So for combined '00123', f=2 → significant_digits is '123'.

Once that's done, form a_str.

So code:

digits = significant_digits

if len(digits) == 1:

    a_str = digits

else:

    rest = digits[1:].rstrip('0')

    if rest:

        a_str = digits[0] + '.' + rest

    else:

        a_str = digits[0]

Then, compute exponent:

if new_integer:

    exponent = len(new_integer) -1

else:

    exponent = -(f + 1)

Finally, output:

if exponent != 0:

    output = f"{a_str}E{exponent}"

else:

    output = a_str

But need to handle cases where exponent is zero.

So, putting this all together.

Now, code:

Read the input, split into integer and fractional parts.

Process new_integer and new_fraction.

Combine into combined.

Find f: first non-zero in combined.

Compute exponent.

Form a_str.

Output.

But how to handle leading zeros in the fractional part when new_integer is empty.

For example, input is ".000123" → new_integer is '', new_fraction is '000123' (since trailing zeros are stripped? No. Because the original fractional_part is '000123', which after stripping trailing zeros (if any) would still be '000123' because there are no trailing zeros. So new_fraction is '000123'.

Combined is '000123', f is 3 (first non-zero is '1').

exponent is -(3 +1) → -4.

significant_digits is '123'.

a_str is '1.23'.

So output '1.23E-4'.

Now, code in Python.

But the problem is that the input can be up to 1e6 characters. So reading the entire input as a string and processing it with Python's split and string methods may be efficient enough.

But for very large strings, splitting on '.' could be done via the string's split method.

But in Python, splitting a string is O(n) time, which is acceptable for 1e6 characters.

So the code steps:

s = input().strip()

dot_pos = s.find('.')

if dot_pos == -1:

    integer_part = s

    fractional_part = ''

else:

    integer_part = s[:dot_pos]

    fractional_part = s[dot_pos+1:]

# process integer_part

new_integer = integer_part.lstrip('0')

# process fractional_part

new_fraction = fractional_part.rstrip('0') if fractional_part else ''

# combined_digits

combined = new_integer + new_fraction

# find first non-zero in combined

if not combined:

    # impossible as x is positive

    print(0)

else:

    first_non_zero = None

    for i, c in enumerate(combined):

        if c != '0':

            first_non_zero = i

            break

    if first_non_zero is None:

        # all zeros, but x is positive, so impossible

        print(0)

    else:

        f = first_non_zero

        significant_digits = combined[f:]

        # form a_str

        if len(significant_digits) == 1:

            a_str = significant_digits

        else:

            rest = significant_digits[1:].rstrip('0')

            if rest:

                a_str = significant_digits[0] + '.' + rest

            else:

                a_str = significant_digits[0]

        # compute exponent

        if new_integer:

            exponent = len(new_integer) - 1

        else:

            exponent = -(f + 1)

        # output

        if exponent != 0:

            print(f"{a_str}E{exponent}")

        else:

            print(a_str)

But let's test this code with the examples.

Example 1: input '16' → integer_part '16', fractional_part ''.

new_integer = '16' (stripped of leading zeros → same).

new_fraction is ''.

combined is '16'.

f is 0.

significant_digits is '16'.

a_str: len is 2.

rest is '6' (since after stripping trailing zeros from '16'[1:], which is '6' → no zeros to strip. So rest is '6' → a_str is '1.6'.

exponent: new_integer is '16' → len is 2. exponent is 2-1=1.

output is '1.6E1' → correct.

Example 2: input '01.23400'.

integer_part is '01', fractional_part is '23400'.

new_integer is '1' (stripped of leading zeros).

new_fraction is '234' (stripped of trailing zeros).

combined is '1' + '234' → '1234'.

f is 0.

significant_digits is '1234' → len 4.

rest is '234' → a_str '1.234'.

exponent: new_integer is '1' → len 1 → exponent 0.

output '1.234' → correct.

Example 3: input '.100'.

integer_part is '', fractional_part is '100'.

new_integer is ''.

new_fraction is '1' (stripped of trailing zeros).

combined is '' + '1' → '1'.

f is 0.

exponent: new_integer is empty → -(0 +1) → -1.

a_str is '1'.

output '1E-1' → correct.

Example 4: input '100.' → integer_part '100', fractional_part is ''.

new_integer is '100' → stripped of leading zeros (no leading zeros), so '100'.

new_fraction is ''.

combined is '100'.

f is 0.

significant_digits is '100'.

rest is '00' → rstrip gives '' → a_str is '1'.

exponent: new_integer is '100' → len 3 → 3-1=2.

output '1E2' → correct.

Another test case: input '0.0012300' → integer_part '0', fractional_part '0012300'.

new_integer is '' (leading zeros stripped).

new_fraction is '00123' (trailing zeros stripped).

combined is '00123'.

f is 2.

significant_digits is '123'.

a_str is '1.23'.

exponent: -(2+1) → -3. So output '1.23E-3'.

Another test case: input '000.00012300' → new_integer is '', new_fraction is '000123' (trailing zeros after '3' are stripped → becomes '000123' → but after stripping trailing zeros, the '00' after '3' are stripped, so '000123' becomes '000123' → no. Wait, the original fractional_part is '00012300', which after stripping trailing zeros is '000123' → new_fraction is '000123'.

combined is '000123'.

f is 3 (index of '1').

exponent is -(3+1) = -4.

a_str: '1.23'.

Output '1.23E-4'.

Another case: input '1234' → new_integer '1234', new_fraction ''.

exponent 4-1=3. a_str '1.234'.

output '1.234E3'.

Another case: input '1234.0' → new_integer '1234', new_fraction ''.

exponent 4-1=3. a_str '1234'[0] + rest. significant_digits is '12340' → wait no. Let's see:

integer_part is '1234', new_integer is '1234' (no leading zeros).

fractional_part is '0' → new_fraction is ''.

combined is '1234' + '' → '1234'.

significant_digits is '1234' → a_str '1.234'.

exponent is 4-1=3. So output '1.234E3'.

But wait, the input is '1234.0' → which is 1234.0 = 1.234E3 → correct.

But what if the input is '1230' → integer_part '1230', new_integer is '1230' (since no leading zeros). new_fraction is ''.

combined is '1230'.

f is 0.

significant_digits is '1230'.

a_str: len 4 → rest is '230' → rstrip '0' → '23' → a_str '1.23'.

exponent 4-1=3. Output '1.23E3'.

Which is correct because 1230 → 1.23e3.

Yes.

The code seems to handle all cases.

```python
