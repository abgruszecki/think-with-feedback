Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about determining whether two wires can be untangled based on the sequence of steps where one is above the other. 

The key is to model the problem correctly. From the examples, I notice that certain sequences can be untangled while others can't. Let's look at the examples to get some intuition.

The first example is "-++-", which outputs Yes. According to the note, the wires can be untangled by adjusting their positions. The second example "+-" outputs No because it creates a full revolution. The third example "++" is Yes because you can just lift the plus wire higher. The fourth example "-" is No because the minus is above plus once, and since the left side starts with plus on top, that's impossible to resolve.

So, what's the pattern here? It seems like the problem is about the parity of crossings and how they can be canceled out. But how?

Let's think in terms of the arrangement of the wires. The wires start with plus on top at the left. We need the wires to end with plus on top at the right (since the device's contacts are fixed in the same order as the wall's). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the device is on the right, and the wall is on the left. Both have two contacts in the same order. So the wires must start with plus on top on the left (as per Mike's observation), and end with the same arrangement on the right. Otherwise, they are considered entangled. Because entanglement is defined as any crossing between the two wires. So to untangle, the wires must run in a way that they don't cross each other at all. So the entire path must be such that plus is always on top of minus, or minus is always on top of plus, but that would require that the left and right ends have the same configuration. But according to the problem statement, the left side starts with plus on top. The right side (device) has two contacts in the same order as the wall. So the right must also have plus on top. So the wires must form a path where, overall, there's an even number of twists. Because each twist would flip their positions, and two twists cancel each other. 

Wait, maybe the problem reduces to checking whether the sequence of steps can be represented as a valid arrangement where the total number of twists is even. But how does each step in the sequence contribute to the twists?

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of consecutive steps can form a certain pattern that can be eliminated. For example, if the sequence has a "+" followed by a "-", maybe that's a loop that can be undone. 

Wait, looking at the third example "++", the output is Yes. So two consecutive plus steps. So the plus is over the minus twice. But how can that be untangled? The note says that by lifting the plus higher. So perhaps consecutive same steps can be merged. So maybe the problem is about grouping the sequence into pairs of same characters. For example, each pair of same steps can be considered a loop that can be canceled. Wait, but in the first example "-++-", which is "-", "+", "+", "-", the output is Yes. Let's see: the sequence has a "-" followed by two "+" then "-". How does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a stack. We process each character, and whenever we find two consecutive same characters, they can be canceled. For example, if the current character is the same as the top of the stack, we pop it. Otherwise, we push. If the final stack is empty or meets certain conditions, then it's possible. 

Wait, let's test this idea with the examples:

First example: "-++-"

Processing:
- Stack starts empty. Push '-'.
Next character '+'. Stack top is '-', different. Push '+'.
Next character '+'. Stack top is '+', same. Pop. Now stack is ['-'].
Next character '-'. Stack top is '-', same. Pop. Stack is empty. So the stack is empty, so output Yes. Which matches the example.

Second example: "+-"

Processing:
Push '+'.
Next character '-'. Stack top is '+', different. Push '-'. Stack has two elements. So output No. Which matches.

Third example: "++"

First '+', stack is empty. Push. Next '+', same as top. Pop. Stack empty. Output Yes. Correct.

Fourth example: "-". Stack not empty. Output No. Correct.

Another example: "+-+" would process as:
Push '+', then '-', then '+'. The third '+' is different from top '-', so push. Stack has three elements. So output No. But what's the actual possibility here?

Wait, perhaps the stack approach is correct. So the problem reduces to checking whether the sequence can be completely reduced by eliminating pairs of same consecutive characters. If the final stack is empty, then output Yes. But wait, in the third example, the stack is empty. The first example's stack is empty. So according to this approach, that's correct. So this seems promising.

But why does this approach work? Let's think. Each pair of consecutive same steps can be considered as a loop that can be undone. For example, two consecutive '+' steps: the plus is over the minus twice in a row. But since the wires can be moved freely (stretched, etc.), these two steps can be merged into one, but since they are the same, maybe they cancel each other. So any two same consecutive steps can be removed. This is similar to the problem of checking balanced parentheses, but here the rule is that same characters can be canceled in pairs. So the algorithm would be to process the sequence and eliminate consecutive duplicates. Then, check if the remaining sequence can be eliminated in pairs.

Wait, but this is exactly what the stack approach does. So, for example, in the first example, the sequence is "-++-", after processing:

- First character '-', push to stack. Stack: ['-']
- Next '+', push. Stack: ['-', '+']
- Next '+', same as top. Pop. Stack: ['-']
- Next '-', same as top. Pop. Stack empty. So output Yes.

This seems to model the problem correctly. 

So the solution is to process the string, and whenever two consecutive same characters are encountered (after processing previous pairs), they are removed. The final result is whether the stack is empty.

Wait, but this seems similar to the problem where you remove adjacent duplicates. For example, like the "aaabba" becomes empty after processing. So, the algorithm is to keep a stack, and for each character in the input, if it's the same as the top of the stack, pop the top. Otherwise, push the current character. If the stack is empty at the end, output Yes, else No.

But let's test this approach against all examples.

Test case 1: -++-
Processing steps:
- '-': stack is empty. Push. Stack: ['-']
- '+': top is '-', different. Push. Stack: ['-', '+']
- '+': top is '+', same. Pop. Stack: ['-']
- '-': top is '-', same. Pop. Stack is empty. Output Yes.

Test case 2: +-
Processing:
- '+': push. Stack: ['+']
- '-': different. Push. Stack: ['+', '-']. Output No.

Test case 3: ++
Processing:
- '+': push. Stack: ['+']
- '+': same as top. Pop. Stack empty. Output Yes.

Test case 4: '-'
Processing: stack becomes ['-'] → output No.

These all match the examples.

Another test case: "+-+-" → stack processing would be:
'+', then '-', then '+', then '-'. Stack size 4. So output No.

Another case: "+--+"

Processing:
'+' → stack ['+']
'-' → different, push → ['+', '-']
'-' → same as top, pop → ['+']
'+' → same as top, pop → empty. Output Yes. So "+--+" → Yes.

But is that correct?

Let's think: the sequence is + followed by two -, then +. So the steps are:

+ (plus over minus), then two times minus (minus over plus each step?), then plus. How can this be untangled?

Wait, the sequence steps are the order in which the wires cross each other. Each '+' indicates that plus is over minus in that step. Each step is a crossing. But for the wires to be untangled, there must be a way to arrange them such that there's no crossings. But according to the stack model, if the stack is empty, then it's possible. So for the "+--+" example, the stack approach says yes. Let's see if that makes sense.

The sequence is +, -, -, +. So the first and fourth steps are +. The second and third are -. Let's imagine that after processing, the first and fourth steps can cancel each other. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the arrangement can be adjusted such that the two '-' steps in the middle form a loop that can be canceled, and the first and last '+' steps can form another loop. But this is getting a bit abstract.

In any case, according to the stack approach, this case would output yes. So perhaps that's the correct model.

Thus, the problem reduces to checking if the processed stack is empty. If yes, then the answer is Yes. Otherwise, No.

So the algorithm is to use a stack. For each character in the input string, we check if it's the same as the top of the stack. If yes, we pop the top. If not, we push the current character. At the end, if the stack is empty, output Yes, else No.

Now, considering the constraints. The input can be up to 1e5 characters. So the algorithm must be O(n) time. The stack approach is O(n) time and O(n) space in the worst case. But for n=1e5, this is manageable in Python, as each stack operation is O(1), and 1e5 operations are acceptable.

But wait, 1e5 elements in the stack would take O(n) space, which for Python should be okay as well, as even 1e5 integers take about 800KB (each is 28 bytes for a string character?), which is well under 256MB memory limit.

So the code would be:

Initialize a stack (like a list in Python). For each character in the input string:

- if the stack is not empty and the top element equals current character:
   - pop the top
- else:
   - append current character

At the end, check if the stack is empty. If yes, output Yes, else No.

This seems straightforward.

Testing all the examples again with this code:

Example 1: "-++-" → stack becomes empty → Yes.

Example 2: "+-" → stack has two elements → No.

Example3: "++" → stack empty → Yes.

Example4: "-" → stack not empty → No.

Another example: "+-+" → stack becomes ['+', '-', '+'] → No.

Another example: "+--+ → stack empty → Yes.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, let's implement this in Python. The code needs to read the input string, process it with the stack, then output "Yes" or "No".

The code would be:

Read s = input().strip()

Initialize stack = []

for c in s:

    if stack and stack[-1] == c:

        stack.pop()

    else:

        stack.append(c)

if not stack:

    print("Yes")

else:

    print("No")

This should work.

But let's check the fourth example: input is '-', stack ends with ['-'], so output is No. Which is correct.

So this code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, considering the constraints. For n=1e5, this loop is O(n), and in Python, appending and popping from the end of a list is O(1) time. So this code should run within the time limit.

As for memory, the stack can be up to n elements in the worst case (e.g., all characters alternating, like "+-+-+..."), which for 1e5 elements is manageable.

Thus, this is the optimal approach.

s = input().strip()
stack = []
for c in s:
    if stack and stack[-1] == c:
        stack.pop()
    else:
        stack.append(c)
print("Yes" if not stack else "No")
