Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about determining whether Stepan's dissatisfaction (which is the maximum number of consecutive N episodes) can exactly be equal to k, given some uncertainty in his memory represented by '?' characters. 

First, I need to understand the input. The input gives a string of 'Y', 'N', and '?'. We can replace the '?'s with either 'Y' or 'N' and check if there's a possible configuration where the maximum consecutive N's is exactly k. Our goal is to determine if such a configuration exists.

Hmm, so the approach here is to model all possible replacements of the '?' and check for the existence of at least one scenario where the maximum consecutive N's is exactly k. But since n can be up to 100, brute-forcing all possibilities (each '?' has two choices) would be 2^100 possibilities, which is way too big. That's impossible to compute directly. So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, so how can we model this without checking all possibilities? Maybe using dynamic programming or some greedy strategy. Let's think about the constraints here. The key is to find if there's a way to replace '?'s such that:

1. The maximum consecutive N's is exactly k. So there must be at least one run of exactly k N's (or possibly longer if k is zero?), but wait no. If k is the maximum, then there should be a run of exactly k N's, and all other runs are <=k. Wait, no. For example, if the maximum is k, then there must be at least one run of k N's, and all other runs are <=k. So, to check this, we need to make sure that after replacing the '?'s, the maximum is exactly k. So the steps are:

- All existing N's and possible N's from '?' must form runs where the maximum is exactly k.

So, the problem reduces to: can we replace the '?'s with 'Y' or 'N' such that the maximum consecutive N's is exactly k.

Now, how to model this. Let's think of possible states that track the current streak of N's and the maximum so far, but for each position in the string. But even that might be computationally heavy, but n is 100, which is manageable.

Wait, the maximum possible streak depends on how we replace the '?'. So perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, tracking for each position, the current streak of N's and the maximum streak encountered so far. The state would be (position, current_streak, max_so_far). But even then, for n=100, current_streak can be up to 100, max_so_far up to 100, so the state space would be 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000 states. That's manageable for a DP approach.

But how to handle the transitions. For each character in the string, depending on whether it's 'Y', 'N', or '?', we can decide the possibilities. For example:

- If the current character is 'Y', then the current streak of N's resets to 0. The max_so_far remains as before.
- If it's 'N', then the current streak increases by 1, and the max_so_far is updated to the maximum of previous max and current streak.
- If it's '?', then we have two choices: treat it as 'Y' or 'N'.

So for each position, we can track all possible (current_streak, max_so_far) pairs. Then, after processing all characters, we check if any of the possible max_so_far values equals k.

Yes. So the idea is to use dynamic programming where each state is the position in the string, the current consecutive N's, and the maximum so far. We can represent this with a DP table that keeps track of possible states.

But how to efficiently represent this. For each position i, and possible current streak s, and possible maximum m, we can track whether this state is reachable.

But perhaps we can model the possible maximum and current streak. Let's think recursively. At each step, for each possible current streak and maximum, we process the next character.

Let's think in terms of sets. For the first i characters, the possible (current_streak, max_so_far) pairs can be represented as a set. For each next character, we process all possible options based on the character being 'Y', 'N', or '?', and update the set accordingly.

So the DP approach would involve, for each position, a set of possible (current, max) pairs. We can start with (current=0, max=0) before processing any characters.

Then, for each character in the string:

- If the character is 'Y', then for each (current, max) in the previous state, the new current becomes 0, and the new max remains the same (since adding 0 doesn't change the max). So new state is (0, max).
- If the character is 'N', then for each (current, max) in the previous state, the new current is current + 1, and new max is max(max, current+1). So new state is (current+1, max(max, current+1)).
- If the character is '?', then we can choose either to treat it as 'Y' or 'N'. So for each (current, max) in the previous state, we generate both possibilities:
   a. Treat as 'Y': new state (0, max)
   b. Treat as 'N': new state (current+1, max(max, current+1))
   
After processing all characters, we collect all possible max_so_far values from the final states. If any of them is exactly k, then the answer is YES, otherwise NO.

Yes! This seems manageable. Now, the next step is to implement this DP approach.

But how to represent the DP states efficiently. Because for each step, the possible (current_streak, max_so_far) pairs can be stored in a set. For n=100, and each current_streak up to 100, and max_so_far up to 100, this is feasible.

So the plan is:

1. Initialize the DP set. Initially, before processing any characters, the current streak is 0, and max is 0. So initial state is {(0,0)}.

2. For each character in the input string (from left to right):

   a. Create a new empty set for the next step.

   b. For each (current, max) in the current DP set:

      i. If the current character is 'Y' or can be replaced with 'Y' (i.e., it's '?'), then:

         - new_current = 0

         - new_max = max

         - add (new_current, new_max) to the next set.

      ii. If the current character is 'N' or can be replaced with 'N' (i.e., it's '?'), then:

         - new_current = current + 1

         - new_max = max(max, new_current)

         - add (new_current, new_max) to the next set.

   c. After processing all possibilities, the DP set for the next step is the union of all these possibilities. However, to optimize, we can merge states where the new_current and new_max are the same. For example, if two different previous states lead to the same (new_current, new_max), we can just keep one.

3. After processing all characters, check if any of the max values in the final DP set is exactly k. If yes, output YES. Else, NO.

Wait, but how do we handle the '?' cases. For example, if the character is '?', we can choose either 'Y' or 'N', so for each existing state, we need to branch into two possibilities. But this could cause the number of states to grow exponentially. However, since current_streak and max_so_far are bounded (current_streak can't exceed n, same for max_so_far), the total number of possible (current, max) pairs is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10,000 per step. And there are 100 steps, so total possible states are 1e6, which is manageable.

So the steps are manageable.

Now, let's think about the implementation. We can represent the DP as a set of tuples (current, max). For each character, we process the current set and generate the next set.

But how to handle the branching for '?'. Let's code it as follows:

For each step, for each character, process all possible choices (Y or N if it's '?'). For each possible choice, update the current streak and max accordingly.

So, for example:

Processing a character c:

If c is 'Y', then for all (current, max) in the current set, the new state is (0, max).

If c is 'N', then for all (current, max) in the current set, the new state is (current+1, max(max, current+1)).

If c is '?', then for all (current, max) in the current set:

   add (0, max) (choosing Y)

   add (current+1, max(max, current+1)) (choosing N)

But wait, in the case of choosing Y, the new current is 0, and the max remains as it was. For choosing N, the new current is current+1, and the new max is the maximum of the previous max and current+1.

Yes. So the code can be structured as a loop over each character, updating the DP set.

Now, to implement this in Python:

We can start with a set (or a dictionary to track possible states) for the DP. Let's use a set of tuples. For each step, create a new set and populate it based on the current character and the previous set.

Now, let's code this step by step.

Initialize the initial state as {(0, 0)}.

Then, for each char in the input string:

   new_dp = set()

   for (current, max_val) in current_dp:

      if the current char can be Y (i.e., if char is 'Y' or '?'):

          new_current = 0

          new_max = max_val

          new_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )

      if the current char can be N (i.e., if char is 'N' or '?'):

          new_current = current + 1

          new_max = max(max_val, new_current)

          new_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )

   current_dp = new_dp

But wait, after processing all possible transitions, the current_dp becomes new_dp. However, some of these (new_current, new_max) pairs may be the same. So using a set automatically removes duplicates.

But for efficiency, even though the set will have O(n^2) elements per step, for n=100, this is manageable.

Once all characters are processed, the final set will contain all possible (current_streak, max_val) pairs. The actual maximum in each case is the max_val, which is the maximum streak encountered up to that point.

So we need to check if any of the max_val in the final set is exactly equal to k. If yes, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.

But wait, the max_val in the final states already represents the maximum streak up to the end. Because even after processing the last character, the maximum could have been set in an earlier position.

So after processing all characters, for each state (current, max_val), the max_val is the maximum consecutive N's in the entire string. So we just need to check if any of these max_vals is exactly equal to k.

Wait, no. Because the max_val is the maximum streak up to that point, which could have been achieved before the last character. But when processing the last character as N, the current streak increases, and the max_val could be updated. So yes, the max_val in the final state is indeed the maximum over the entire string.

Yes. So the final step is to check if any of the max_val in the final states equals k.

So putting it all together:

Read n and k.

Read the string s.

Initialize current_dp = {(0, 0)}.

For each character in s:

   new_dp = set()

   for (current, max_val) in current_dp:

      if c can be Y (c is 'Y' or '?'):

          new_current = 0

          new_max = max_val

          new_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )

      if c can be N (c is 'N' or '?'):

          new_current = current + 1

          new_max = max(max_val, new_current)

          new_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )

   current_dp = new_dp

After processing all characters, check if any of the max_val in current_dp is equal to k.

If yes, output YES. Else, NO.

Yes! That seems correct.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:

5 2

NYNNY

So the string is 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'Y'.

Processing each character:

Start with {(0,0)}.

First character 'N':

For each state (0,0):

   can only choose N (since c is 'N'):

   new_current = 0+1=1

   new_max = max(0, 1) =1

   new_dp = {(1,1)}

Second character 'Y':

For each state (1,1):

   can only choose Y:

   new_current=0

   new_max=1

   new_dp = {(0,1)}

Third character 'N':

For state (0,1):

   choose N:

   new_current=0+1=1, new_max = max(1, 1) =1. So (1,1).

   But wait, current was 0. Adding 1 gives new_current 1. Max was 1. So new_max is 1.

   So new state is (1,1).

Fourth character 'N':

For state (1,1):

   choose N. new_current=2, new_max is max(1,2)=2. So state (2,2).

Fifth character 'Y':

For state (2,2):

   choose Y: new_current=0, new_max remains 2. So state (0,2).

So final states are {(0,2)}. The max_val is 2. So output is YES. Which matches the example.

Second example:

6 1

????NN

So the string is four '?', then two 'N's.

We need to see if the maximum can be exactly 1.

The last two characters are 'N's, which form a streak of 2. So even if the first four are all Y's, the maximum is 2. So the answer is NO. Which matches the example.

So the code should handle that.

Now, edge cases:

What if k=0? That means the dissatisfaction is zero, which implies there are no N's in any configuration. So all characters must be Y, and all existing 'N's would make it impossible. So if the input has any 'N's, then the answer is NO. If there are '?', we can replace them with Y's. So in the code, if the input has any 'N's, then when replacing '?'s, the user cannot choose N for any, but wait no. To get k=0, there must be zero N's. So any existing N in the input makes it impossible, since those have to be N, leading to a streak of at least 1. So for k=0, the answer is possible only if all characters are 'Y' or '?', and when replacing '?'s with Y's, there are no N's. But the problem is that if the original string has any 'N's, then even if you replace other '?'s with Y's, the 'N's would create streaks of at least 1, which would make the maximum >=1, so the answer is NO. So for k=0, the code should check if there's no 'N's in the original string, and that all '?'s are replaced with Y's. So the code would need to process this.

In the DP approach, for k=0, the code would check if any of the final max_vals is 0. Which would only be possible if all transitions didn't include any N's. Let's see.

Suppose the input is "Y?Y", and k=0. Then the code would check possible options. For the '?', choosing Y would lead to a max of 0, but if any 'N's are chosen, it would be 1. So the code would find that possible, and return YES.

But if the input has an 'N', then in the DP steps, there must be transitions that include N, leading to streaks >=1, which would make the max_val >=1. So the code would correctly return NO.

So the code handles k=0 correctly.

Another edge case: n=1, k=0. Input is 'N'. Then the maximum is 1, so output NO. If input is '?', then possible to choose Y, so maximum is 0. Then output YES if k=0.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

Now, let's code this in Python.

But in Python, using sets of tuples for the DP steps. For each character, process the current set and generate the next set.

Now, the code:

Read n and k from input. Then read the string s. Then process each character in s.

The code would be something like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, k = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    current_dp = set()
    current_dp.add( (0, 0) )

    for c in s:
        next_dp = set()
        for (current, max_val) in current_dp:
            # Handle Y possibility
            if c == 'Y' or c == '?':
                new_current = 0
                new_max = max_val
                next_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )
            # Handle N possibility
            if c == 'N' or c == '?':
                new_current = current + 1
                new_max = max(max_val, new_current)
                next_dp.add( (new_current, new_max) )
        current_dp = next_dp

    # Check if any max_val in current_dp is exactly k
    for (cur, m) in current_dp:
        if m == k:
            print("YES", file=output_stream)
            return
    print("NO", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
6 1
????NN
""",
            "output": \
"""\
NO
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example:

6 1

????NN

Process the first four '?'s.

Wait, but the code processes all 6 characters. Let's see:

The last two are 'N's.

So after processing the last two 'N's, the streak would be at least 2.

So the final max would be >=2, which is larger than k=1. So the code returns NO.

Yes.

Another test case: input where all are '?', n=3, k=3. Then the code would have the possibility to set all to N, leading to max 3. So output YES.

Another test case: n=3, k=2, input is '???'. Can we have a maximum of exactly 2? For example, NNY -> max is 2. Or NNN -> max is 3. Or YNN -> 2. So yes. So the code would output YES.

So the code should handle that.

Yes, this approach should be correct.

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s = input().strip()

current = {(0, 0)}
for c in s:
    next_set = set()
    for (curr_streak, max_val) in current:
        if c in ('Y', '?'):
            next_set.add((0, max_val))
        if c in ('N', '?'):
            new_streak = curr_streak + 1
            new_max = max(max_val, new_streak)
            next_set.add((new_streak, new_max))
    current = next_set

print("YES" if any(m == k for _, m in current) else "NO")
```
