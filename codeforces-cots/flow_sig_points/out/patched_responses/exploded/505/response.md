Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if it's possible to merge all the piles into one by moving the rightmost pile onto either the previous (x-1) or the x-3 pile, but only if the top cards match in either value or suit. Hmm.

So the initial state is each card as a separate pile. At each step, we can take the last pile and put it on either x-1 or x-3, provided the top cards match. And we need to check if all can be merged into a single pile.

The key here is to model the possible states and transitions. But since the number of piles can be up to 52, but each move reduces the count by 1, the maximum steps would be 51 steps. However, with possible branching (each step could have two choices), a naive BFS might be feasible. Let's think about possible approaches.

Wait, the maximum possible number of piles is 52, but each move reduces the number by 1. So the possible states could be modeled by the current sequence of piles. But even then, the state space could be huge. For example, when there are k piles, each pile could have varying numbers of cards, and the top card's value and suit. But how can we represent this state efficiently?

Alternatively, since the moves are only allowed by moving the last pile onto x-1 or x-3, perhaps we can model the state as a list of piles, and track the possible transitions. But even with 52 piles, the possible states might be manageable if we use memoization or BFS with pruning.

Wait, but n is up to 52. Let's think: Each step reduces the number of piles by 1. So the total steps needed to reach 1 pile is n-1. The problem is to check if there's a sequence of moves leading to 1 pile.

But the problem is, for each state, we can have up to two possible moves (if x-1 and x-3 exist and the top cards match). So the branching factor is 2, and the depth is up to 51. So the total possible states could be up to 2^51, which is way too big for a brute-force approach.

That's impossible. So a BFS approach would not work here. So there must be some smarter way to model the state to reduce the state space.

Wait, but maybe some moves can be applied in any order. For example, perhaps certain moves can be prioritized to reduce the state space. Alternatively, we can model the state as the list of piles, but track the top cards of each pile and their order. But even that, the number of possible states is way too big.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the only allowed moves are moving the last pile onto the previous (x-1) or the x-3 pile. So the decision for each step depends on the current last three piles (since x can be the last, x-1 is next to last, etc.), and the possible moves might be limited based on their top cards.

Wait, when you have x piles, the possible moves are to take pile x and merge it onto x-1 or x-3. So after merging, the new pile count is x-1. The new piles are:

If merging onto x-1: piles 1 to x-2, then the merged pile (x-1 + x). The top card is the top of pile x's top card (since x is placed on top of x-1). So the new top card is the same as pile x's top card.

Similarly, merging onto x-3: the new pile is x-3 + x, so the top card is the top of x.

So each move affects the last few piles. Maybe the state can be represented by the current list of piles (their top cards), but since each move affects only the last few, perhaps the state can be tracked in a way that only keeps track of the last few piles. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the moves are only allowed on the last pile, perhaps the order in which piles are merged can be determined by some greedy approach. For example, perhaps it's possible to always prioritize merging onto x-1 or x-3 when possible. But how to know which choice would lead to a solution?

Another observation: when merging x onto x-1, the new pile's top card is the same as x's top. So after merging, the new x-1 (now in position x-1 in the new state) has top card from x. Then, in the next step, the new last pile is x-2 (since the total piles are now x-1). Hmm. So the choice of merging to x-1 or x-3 can affect which moves are possible next.

This seems complex. But given the problem's constraints (n up to 52), we need an efficient solution. Let's think of dynamic programming approaches. But again, the state space is a problem.

Wait, perhaps we can model the state as a list of the top cards of each pile. Since each pile's top card is all that matters for future moves. So for a state with k piles, the state is a list of k top cards. Also, the order of the piles is important because the moves are based on their positions.

The question is: how many possible unique states are there? For each pile, there are 13 possible values and 4 suits, so 52 possible cards. If we have up to 52 piles, each with a possible 52 top cards, the number of states is 52^52, which is astronomically large. So that's not feasible.

So we need a smarter approach. Let's think again about the problem's structure.

Each move can only merge the last pile into x-1 or x-3. So the possible moves are limited and perhaps the state can be represented in a way that only keeps track of certain piles. For example, the last few piles might be sufficient to make decisions.

Wait, when you merge pile x onto x-1, the new pile is x-1 (with top card from x). Then, the new number of piles is x-1. The next move's possible targets are (x-1 -1) = x-2 and (x-1 -3) = x-4. So the possible moves after merging x into x-1 will depend on the previous piles. But if we have to track all the way back, then this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that after merging x onto x-1, the new x-1's top card is the same as x's top card. So the next move's possible merges will look at the new x-1 (which is now the last pile in the new state).

Wait, the order is important. Let's say after merging x onto x-1, the new pile is in position x-1. The next move will have x-1 as the new x. So the new last pile is at position x-1 (since there are now x-1 piles). So, in the next step, the possible moves are to merge x-1 (the last pile) onto x-2 (if exists) or x-4 (if exists). So the decision in each step is based on the current last pile's top card and the possible previous piles.

Hmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a state consisting of the last few piles. For example, the last three piles, since merging x onto x-1 or x-3 would require those piles to have certain top cards.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be represented using a stack-like structure, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The problem is similar to the classic card game where you can combine adjacent cards under certain conditions, but here the movement is limited. Since the possible moves are only on the last pile, perhaps the problem can be solved with backtracking, but optimized with memoization.

But even with memoization, the number of possible states might be too large. For example, each state is a list of piles (each with a top card and possibly a size, but the size doesn't matter except for the top card). So for 52 cards, the number of possible states would be 52!/(product of duplicates), but that's way too big.

So maybe the key is to model the problem using dynamic programming, but track only the necessary information. Let's think of the state as the current list of piles. Since each move only affects the last few piles, perhaps the state can be represented by a certain number of the last piles' top cards.

Wait, when you have x piles, the possible moves are to merge x into x-1 or x-3. After merging into x-1, the new number of piles is x-1, and the new last three piles are (x-2, x-1 (merged)), but this depends on the previous arrangement. Alternatively, after merging into x-3, the new number of piles is x-1, and the new last few piles are (x-4, x-3 (merged), x-2). Hmm.

This seems too vague. Maybe trying to model the state as the sequence of top cards of the piles. But even that seems infeasible for n=52.

Alternative idea: Since each move is only allowed on the last pile, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily trying possible moves whenever possible, using memoization to avoid revisiting the same state.

But even with memoization, the state space is too large. So what's the alternative?

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a breadth-first search (BFS) where each state is a list of top cards of the piles. The BFS would explore possible states by applying the allowed moves. The key is to track the visited states to avoid revisiting them.

But for n=52, the initial state has 52 piles. The number of possible states can be very high, but maybe in practice, the BFS is manageable. Let's do some rough calculations.

Suppose that each state is a list of top cards, each of which has 52 possibilities (but in reality, some cards are duplicates, but the problem allows duplicates in the input). For a state with k piles, the number of possible states is (52 choose 1) ^ k. For k=52, that's 52^52, which is impossible. Even for k=10, 52^10 is 1.4e17, which is way too big.

So this approach is not feasible. Therefore, the problem requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be represented as a graph where nodes represent possible positions and some transitions. But again, the state space is the problem.

Let me think of the problem in terms of memoization. For each possible configuration of piles, can we memoize whether it's possible to reach the solution?

But again, for 52 cards, the number of possible configurations is way too big.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem can be solved using memoization with some optimized state representation. For example, since the moves are only allowed on the last pile, the state can be represented by the sequence of piles, but only the last few piles might affect the possible moves.

Wait, when considering merging the last pile, the possible moves depend on the last three piles. For example, if there are x piles, you can merge x into x-1 (if x >=2) or into x-3 (if x >=4). So, to check if merging x into x-1 is possible, we need to check the top card of pile x and pile x-1. Similarly for x-3.

After merging, the new state's piles are modified: for merging into x-1, the new x-1 pile's top is x's top. The other piles remain the same.

So, the state transitions are determined by the current last few piles. Thus, maybe the state can be represented by the last few piles, but how many?

For example, after merging into x-1, the new pile is x-1, which is now the last pile. The next move's possible merges depend on the previous piles (x-2, x-3, etc.), but perhaps only the last few are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled with a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current list of top cards of the piles, but only keeping track of the last 3 piles. Because merging into x-1 or x-3 requires those positions.

Wait, but x can be up to 52. For example, when x is 52, merging into x-3 (49th pile) would require looking at the 49th pile's top card. So that's not part of the last few piles. So this approach might not work.

Hmm. Maybe the problem requires a different approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of possible moves and whether there's a way to reduce the number of piles step by step by making any possible move.

This is similar to a game where each move reduces the problem size. For example, each time, you can choose to merge the last pile into x-1 or x-3, if possible. The problem is to see if there's a sequence of moves that leads to a single pile.

The key is that the moves are not arbitrary. So perhaps we can model this with recursion and memoization. But with n=52, even memoizing all possible states is impossible.

Alternative idea: Since each move is on the last pile, perhaps the problem can be solved using a backtracking approach with memoization, but only considering the current state's top cards of certain piles. For example, the last three piles and the x-3 position. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with memoization by considering the current stack of piles, but only keeping track of the top cards. However, even with that, the number of possible states is too high.

Wait, let's think about the example input 4:

4 piles, all with top cards 2S, 2S, 2C, 2C. The solution is to merge 4 onto 1 (x-3, since 4-3=1). Then merge 3 onto 2 (since after first merge, the piles are 3 piles: 2S (merged 1 and 4), 2S, 2C. Then merging 3 (now the last pile) onto 2 (x-1) gives 2 piles. Then merge 2 onto 1 (x-1 again). So all steps are possible.

This suggests that merging to x-3 can be necessary. So the problem can't be solved by always merging to x-1 first.

So, the algorithm must consider both possibilities at each step.

But with n=52, a BFS approach is impossible. So what's the alternative?

Wait, maybe the problem can be represented in a way that each state is represented by the current list of piles, and we can model this with memoization and backtracking, but using some pruning. However, given the time constraints (2 seconds), even this might not be feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since each move reduces the number of piles by 1, and the possible moves are only on the last pile, perhaps the problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization. But even then, the number of possible states is way too big. For example, with 52 piles, even after 10 moves, the number of possible states is 2^10 = 1024, which is manageable. But after 20 moves, it's 1 million, but 51 moves would be 2^51, which is way beyond.

So this approach is not feasible. Thus, another idea is needed.

Wait, perhaps the order in which the moves are made can allow certain optimizations. For example, when there are multiple possible moves, perhaps trying them in a certain order (like preferring merging to x-1 first) can lead to a solution faster. However, this is a heuristic and doesn't guarantee correctness.

Alternatively, the problem may have a dynamic programming structure where the state can be represented by the current piles in a certain way. But I'm not seeing it.

Another Idea: Let's model the problem using a BFS, but with a state that is represented as a tuple of the top cards of the piles. Since each move only affects the last few piles, perhaps we can find that the state transitions are manageable.

But even for n=52, each state is a tuple of 52 elements. However, the initial state is the list of cards. Each move reduces the number of piles by 1, so the next state has 51 elements, etc. The problem is that even with 52 steps, the number of possible states can be enormous.

But maybe in practice, the number of possible states is manageable. Let's see.

The maximum number of possible states for each step:

For example, after the first move (merging from 52 piles to 51), there are up to 2 possible states (if both moves are possible). Then, for each of those, another 2 possibilities, etc. So the worst case is 2^51, which is way too big.

But perhaps in practice, the number of possible states is much smaller because some moves are not possible. For example, if only one move is possible at each step, then the BFS would have a linear path, making it manageable. But the problem is that the test cases could be constructed to have many possibilities.

So, the BFS approach might work for small n but not for n=52.

But the problem's n can be up to 52. So this suggests that the BFS approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Think of the problem in reverse. Instead of merging piles, can we model the problem as building the initial state from a single pile by splitting. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, model the problem as a graph where each node is a state, and edges are possible moves. The problem is to find a path from the initial state to the state with a single pile. But again, the state space is too large.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think of the constraints again. The time limit is 2 seconds. Python can handle around 1e6 operations per second (roughly). So, for 2 seconds, around 2e6 operations. So the algorithm needs to be O(1e6) steps.

If the BFS has a manageable number of states, say, up to 1e6, then it could work.

But how many possible states can there be for a given n?

Let's calculate for small n:

n=1: 1 state.

n=2: if the two cards can't be merged, then 1 state. If they can be merged, then merging leads to 1 state. So total states: 2 (initial and merged).

n=3: initial 3 piles. Possible moves: merge 3 into 2 (if possible) or 0 (but 3-3=0, invalid). So for n=3, the possible moves are merging into 2. So after that, 2 piles. Then merging into 1 (if possible). So for each state, the BFS would track the possible top cards.

But for n=4, merging into 3 or 1. So each state could branch into two possibilities.

But even for n=4, the number of possible states is 1 (initial) → 2 → 4 → 8 → ... But this depends on whether the moves are possible.

So for n=52, the number of possible states could be up to 2^51, which is impossible.

So the BFS approach is not feasible for n=52.

Alternative Idea: Find a way to represent the state in a way that allows for memoization with a compressed state. For example, since the moves can only affect the last few piles, perhaps the state can be represented by the last few piles' top cards. For example, the last 3 piles. But how?

Wait, when you merge the last pile into x-1 or x-3, the merging affects the x-1 or x-3 pile. For example, merging into x-1 pile: the new x-1 pile's top is the same as the merged pile (since the last pile is placed on top). So, the next moves will be based on the new x-1 pile (now the last pile) and the previous piles. But how many of the previous piles' top cards are needed to determine future moves?

This is unclear. Let's think: suppose after merging x into x-1, the new x-1 pile is now the last pile. The next move can only merge into x-2 (if possible) or x-4 (if possible). Wait, no: the new number of piles is x-1. So the next move is in x-1 piles. So the possible moves are to merge pile (x-1) onto (x-1 -1) = x-2, if x-2 exists (i.e., x-1 >=2), or onto (x-1 -3) = x-4, if x-4 exists (i.e., x-1 >=4).

So the merging is always done on the last pile. But the merging options depend on the current x (number of piles).

But this suggests that each move's options are determined by the current number of piles and the top cards of the x-1 and x-3 piles (if they exist).

Hmm. So when there are k piles, the possible moves are:

- Merge pile k onto pile k-1 (if k >=2 and the top cards match)

- Merge pile k onto pile k-3 (if k >=4 and the top cards match)

So, for the current state, the possible moves depend on the top cards of the last pile (k) and the k-1 or k-3 piles.

But how to model this in a way that allows us to track the necessary information for future moves.

Ah! Here's a key insight: When merging pile k into pile k-1, the new pile (k-1) now has the top card of pile k. So, for future moves, the relevant top cards are:

- The new pile k-1's top (was pile k's top)

- The piles before k-1 remain the same.

Similarly, merging into k-3: the new pile k-3's top becomes pile k's top. The piles after k-3 (but before k) remain the same.

So, after a merge, the top cards of certain piles are modified, which affects future moves.

But modeling this is challenging. However, perhaps we can represent the state as a list of the top cards of all piles, but notice that for each merge, only one pile's top card is changed (the target pile), and the rest remain the same. So the state can be represented as a list of top cards, but each merge modifies one element (the target pile's top card) and removes the last element.

Wait, no. When you merge pile x into x-1:

- The new piles are 1..x-2, and the merged pile (x-1's original top is replaced by x's top). Then the number of piles becomes x-1. So the new list is the original list up to x-2, then the merged pile (x-1's new top is x's top), and the x pile is removed.

Wait, no: merging x into x-1. So, the pile x-1 and x are merged. The merged pile is x-1's pile plus x's pile, with x's top card on top. So the new pile list is [pile_1, ..., pile_{x-2}, merged_pile, ...]. But the merged_pile is formed by placing pile x on top of pile x-1. So the merged_pile's top is the top of pile x.

So the new list of top cards is the original list up to x-2, then the top card of pile x (since x is placed on x-1), and then all piles after x-1 (but there are none, since x is the last). So the new list of top cards after merging x into x-1 is the original list up to x-2, then the top card of x, and then the merged pile is at position x-1 (which is now the last pile).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's take an example:

Original piles are [p1, p2, p3, p4]. So x=4.

After merging p4 into p3 (x-1), the new piles are [p1, p2, p3_merged], where p3_merged's top is p4's top. So the new top cards are [p1.top, p2.top, p4.top]. The number of piles is 3.

In the next step, x is 3. The possible moves are merging into x-1 (2) or x-3 (0, invalid). So merging into 2.

The new merged pile's top is p3_merged's top (which was p4's top). So the new top cards are [p1.top, p4.top].

So each merge operation affects the top card of the target pile and removes the last pile.

Thus, the state after each move is determined by the previous state's top cards, with the target pile's top card updated to the merged pile's top (the last pile's top), and the last pile removed.

This is a crucial observation. So, the state can be represented as a list of top cards of the current piles. Each move modifies the list as follows:

- For merging onto x-1:

   The new list is the original list up to x-2, followed by the original list[x-1] replaced by list[x], and then the remaining piles after x-1 are removed (since x is merged into x-1).

Wait, no. Because when you merge x into x-1, the new pile is formed by placing x on top of x-1. So the top card of the new pile is x's top. So the new list of top cards is:

list[0], list[1], ..., list[x-2], list[x-1], list[x] → becomes list[0], ..., list[x-2], list[x] (since x's top is the new top of x-1's pile). But since x is merged into x-1, the new number of piles is x-1. So the new list is list[0..x-2] + [list[x-1]] → no, wait. The original list has x piles. After merging x into x-1, the new list has x-1 piles. The first x-2 piles are unchanged, the (x-1)th pile now has a new top (equal to list[x-1]'s top if merged into x-1? Wait, no. Wait, the merged pile is x-1 + x. So the top card is x's top, which was list[x-1] (since x was the last pile, list[x-1] is the top of pile x). Wait, no: the original list of top cards is a list where the i-th element is the top of the (i+1)th pile? Or is it zero-based?

Let me clarify. Let's say the piles are numbered from 1 to x. So the top cards are c1, c2, ..., cx. When we merge pile x into pile x-1, the new merged pile's top is cx. The new list of top cards is c1, c2, ..., cx-2, cx. The length is x-1.

Similarly, merging x into x-3 (if x >=4) results in a new list where the top card of x-3 is replaced by cx, and the remaining piles after x-3 are shifted. For example, original list is [c0, c1, c2, c3] (x=4). Merging 4 into 1 (x-3=1) would result in a new list [c0 (unchanged), c3 (new top for pile 1), c1 (pile 2?), c2 (pile 3?), ... no. Wait, merging x into x-3: the new merged pile is x-3 + x. So the new merged pile's top is cx. The new list of piles is [c0, c1, c2, ..., c_{x-4}, cx, c_{x-3}, c_{x-2} ... up to x-1-1 = x-2? Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternative example: Original piles are [p1, p2, p3, p4]. The top cards are [c1, c2, c3, c4]. Merging p4 into p1 (x-3=1). The new merged pile is p1's cards followed by p4's cards. The top card is c4. The new list of piles is [merged_pile (top c4), p2, p3]. So the top cards are [c4, c2, c3]. So the new list is formed by taking the first x-3-1 = 0 elements (since x-3 is 1, so x-3-1=0), then the merged pile (c4), then the elements from x-3 to x-1 (but after merging, the piles are x-1 in number, which is 3. So the merged pile is at position x-3 (1), so the new list would be:

For merging x into x-3:

The new list is:

original[0 ... x-4] + [original[x-1]] (since x's top is merged into x-3) + original[x-3+1 ... x-2] (the piles between x-3+1 and x-2, inclusive).

Wait, perhaps this is easier to see with indices. Let's model the piles as a list called 'piles', where piles[0] is the first pile, piles[1] is the second, etc. So for x piles, the indices are 0 to x-1.

When merging the last pile (index x-1) into x-1 -1 (index x-2) if possible (i.e., x >=2) and the top cards match, then:

- The new merged pile is at index x-2, with top card = piles[x-1].top.
- The new list of piles is piles[0 ... x-2] (length x-1). Wait, no. Because the original list is piles[0], piles[1], ..., piles[x-1]. Merging the last into x-2 (index x-2):

The new merged pile is at index x-2, with top card piles[x-1].top. The new list is the first x-2 elements, then the merged pile (piles[x-2] merged with piles[x-1]), but the merged pile's top is piles[x-1].top.

Wait, the original list has x elements. After merging, there are x-1 elements. So the new list is:

piles[0], piles[1], ..., piles[x-3], merged_pile.

Where merged_pile is piles[x-2] merged with piles[x-1]. So the merged_pile's top is piles[x-1].top.

So the new list's top cards are:

piles[0].top, piles[1].top, ..., piles[x-3].top, piles[x-1].top.

Similarly, if merging into x-3 (index x-4) (when x >=4), the new merged_pile is at index x-4, with top card piles[x-1].top. The new list is:

piles[0 ... x-5], merged_pile (top card piles[x-1].top), piles[x-4 ... x-2].

Wait, no. For example, merging the last pile (index x-1) into index x-4 (x-3-1 = x-4 when x-3 is the original position):

The new list would be:

piles[0 ... x-4-1] (up to index x-5) + merged_pile (piles[x-4] merged with piles[x-1], top is piles[x-1].top) + piles[x-4+1 ... x-2].

So the new list is:

original[0 ... x-5], merged_pile, original[x-3 ... x-2].

So the top cards are:

[ original[0].top, ..., original[x-5].top, original[x-1].top, original[x-3].top, original[x-2].top ]

But the length is (x-5 + 1) + 1 + (x-2 - (x-3) +1) ) = (x-4) + 1 + (2) ) = x-4 + 3 = x+ (-4+3) = x-1.

Which is correct.

So, merging into x-3 (index x-4) results in a new list where the top card at index x-4 is now the original's x-1's top, and the remaining elements are the original's x-4+1 to x-2.

So, the key insight here is that merging into x-1 modifies the (x-2)th index (since the list is zero-based) to be the merged top card, and merging into x-3 modifies the (x-4)th index to be the merged top card.

This suggests that when making a move, the state can be represented as a list of top cards, and each merge operation changes one of the earlier elements (either x-2 or x-4) to the merged top card and removes the last element.

Thus, the state transitions are as follows:

When merging into x-1:

new_piles = current_piles[0 ... x-2-1] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-2 ... x-2]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the new list as current_piles[0 to x-2-1] (which is current_piles[0 to x-3]) followed by the merged pile (current_piles[x-1]), and then current_piles[x-2] (but x-2 is x-2 = x-2, but after merging, the merged pile is at position x-2, which is now the last pile (since the new x is x-1). So the new list is current_piles[0..x-3] + [current_piles[x-1]] (because the merged pile's top is current_piles[x-1], which was the last pile's top.

For example, if current_piles is [a, b, c, d], x=4. Merging into x-1 (3) means merging the 4th pile into the 3rd. The new list is [a, b, d], since the merged pile's top is d. So the new x is 3.

So the new list is current_piles[0:x-2] + [current_piles[x-1]], where x is the original number of piles.

Similarly, merging into x-3 (which for x=4 would be 1), the new list is current_piles[0:x-3-1] (x-3-1 = 0) + [current_piles[x-1]] (d) + current_piles[x-3 :x-1-1], which is current_piles[1:3-1] (since x-3 is 1, and x-1-1 is 3-1=2). Wait, x-1-1 is (original x-1) -1 = x-2. So for x=4, merging into x-3=1, the new list is:

current_piles[0 ... x-3-1] (0 ... 0-1) → empty, then [current_piles[x-1]] → [d], then current_piles[x-3 ... x-2-1] → current_piles[1 ... 2], which are [b, c].

So the new list is [d, b, c]. But this is of length 3 (original x=4 → new x=3).

So, the new list after merging into x-3 is current_piles[0 to x-4-1] (if x-4-1 >=0) followed by [current_piles[x-1]] (merged pile's top), followed by current_piles[x-3 to x-2-1].

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

When merging into x-1 (position x-2 in zero-based):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-2] + [current_piles[x-1]] 

When merging into x-3 (position x-4 in zero-based):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

Because x-3 is the original x-3 (which is x-3 = x-4+1?), maybe not. Let's take the example of x=4:

x-3 =1 (original x-3). x-4 =0. So new_piles is current_piles[0 : 0] (empty) + [d] + current_piles[1 :3], which is [d] + [b, c]. So new_piles is [d, b, c], which is correct.

Yes, this formula works.

Thus, the general case for merging into x-1 (when possible):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-2] + [current_piles[x-1]]

For merging into x-3 (when possible):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

Where x is the current number of piles.

So, each merge operation creates a new list of top cards by combining parts of the original list, inserting the merged top card, and discarding the last element.

Now, the question is: can we model the state as the list of top cards and perform BFS with memoization of visited states?

But with n=52, even this is impossible. For example, each state is a list of up to 52 elements, each of which can be 52 possible cards. So for 52 elements, it's 52^52 possible states. Which is way too big.

But maybe the problem has some properties that allow for pruning. For example, if we reach a state with a certain number of piles, and some of the top cards are the same as in previous states, we can avoid revisiting them.

But even so, for n=52, it's impossible.

Alternative Idea: Since each move only affects the last few piles, perhaps the state can be represented by the last few piles' top cards. For example, the last 3 piles. But how to determine if this is sufficient.

For example, when merging into x-3, the merged pile's top is now in a position x-3, which is not part of the last few piles. So future moves could involve that position again. Thus, this approach might not work.

Another Idea: Realize that the problem is similar to the classic problem of reducing the sequence via certain operations, and that dynamic programming with state represented by the current top cards is the way to go. But with the state being the current list of top cards, the BFS could be implemented with memoization, using a hashable representation (like a tuple) to track visited states.

But even with that, for n=52, it's impossible. So perhaps the problem can only be solved for small n, but the constraints allow n=52. So how?

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. For example, considering that the order of merging may not matter in certain cases, or that the problem can be modeled as a graph where the nodes are the piles and the edges are the possible merges, but again, this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as a state transition where each move is either merging to x-1 or x-3. For each possible state (list of top cards), we track whether it's possible to reach the final state. We can use BFS with memoization of visited states.

But with n=52, even this approach is not feasible. So maybe the problem requires a different approach, perhaps using memoization with a more compact state.

Another Idea: Since the merging is done on the last pile, perhaps the problem can be solved using a greedy approach where we always try to merge into x-1 first if possible. Only if that doesn't lead to a solution, we try merging into x-3. However, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases. For example, the first sample requires merging into x-3 first.

So, this approach could miss valid solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved using memoization with the current state being the list of top cards, but using memoization with pruning to avoid certain states.

But again, this is unclear.

Hmm. Let's think about what determines whether a state can lead to a solution. Each move reduces the number of piles by 1. The goal is to reach 1 pile. So, for each state (list of top cards), we can try both possible moves (if applicable) and recursively check if any of them leads to a solution.

But with memoization, this could be feasible. Let's think of memoizing the function that takes the list of top cards and returns whether it's possible to reach a solution from there.

But for a list of 52 elements, the number of possible states is way too big. Even for 10 elements, it's 52^10 = 1.4e17. This is impossible.

Thus, I'm stuck. Maybe there's a different way to model the problem.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each move allows us to merge the last pile into x-1 or x-3, but once merged, those piles are no longer available for further merging. So, the problem can be viewed as a sequence of decisions that have to be made in reverse order. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a bitmask or other compact state representation. For example, if the current state can be represented by certain aspects of the top cards, like the counts of each suit or value, but this seems unlikely to capture the necessary information.

Another Idea: Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a state (list of top cards) and edges are the possible merges. Then, the problem reduces to finding a path from the initial state to the state with one pile. However, the number of nodes is too large. So, this is not feasible.

Hmm. I'm running out of ideas. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved with a BFS approach, but with a smart state representation that allows for hashing the state quickly and checking visited states.

In Python, tuples are hashable and can be used as keys in a set. So, for each state, we can represent it as a tuple of the top cards. Then, we can perform BFS, keeping track of visited states.

But for n=52, even if each step reduces the number of piles by 1, the maximum number of steps is 51. But each step could have two possible branches, leading to 2^51 possible states, which is way too large. However, in practice, many of these states would be invalid or impossible. For example, if merging is not possible in a certain step, then no branching occurs.

So, perhaps for the given problem, a BFS approach is feasible for the given constraints. Let's test this with some examples.

For the first sample input:

Initial state: 4 piles, top cards ['2S', '2S', '2C', '2C'].

Possible moves:

Merge 4 into 1 (x-3 =4-3=1). The new state is ['2S', '2S', '2C'] merged into 1, so new top cards are ['2C', '2S', '2C']? No, wait, no. Let me think.

No, merging 4 (index 3) into 1 (index 0) when x=4. But x-3 =1 (x=4, x-3=1). So merging into x-3 would mean merging into index 0 (since x-3=1 in 1-based, which is index 0 in 0-based).

So, the new state after merging is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] (x-4 is 0, so 0:0 is empty) + [current_piles[x-1]] (current_piles[3], which is '2C') + current_piles[x-3 : x-1] (x-3=1, x-1=3. So current_piles[1:3] is ['2S', '2C']).

So the new state is ['2C', '2S', '2C']. So the new piles are 3.

Then, next possible moves: merging the last pile (3) into 2 (x-1=2) if possible. The top cards are '2C' and '2S' (from the previous state). '2C' and '2S' do not have the same value or suit. So cannot merge into x-1. Can we merge into x-3 (3-3=0)? If x=3, x-3=0. So merging into 0. So the new state would be:

current_piles[0 : x-4] (x-4= -1, so empty) + [current_piles[x-1]] (current_piles[2] is '2C') + current_piles[x-3 : x-1] (x-3=0, x-1=2. So current_piles[0:2] is ['2C', '2S'].

So the new state is ['2C', '2S', '2C'] merged into x-3 (0-based index 0), new state is ['2C'] + ['2S', '2C'][0:2] → wait, no. Wait, x=3. So merging into x-3=0 (0-based index 0).

The new state is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → x-4 is 3-4 =-1 → no elements.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → current_piles[2] is '2C'

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=0, x-1=2 → slices from 0 to 2 (exclusive), which is 0 to 1 → ['2C', '2S'].

So the new state is ['2C'] + ['2C', '2S'] → ['2C', '2C', '2S']? Or is it [current_piles[x-1]] followed by current_piles[x-3 : x-1] ?

Wait, for merging into x-3 (original x=3, x-3=0):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] (since x-4=3-4=-1, so no elements) + [current_piles[x-1]] (current_piles[2] = '2C') + current_piles[x-3 : x-1] (x-3=0, x-1=2 → current_piles[0:2], which is ['2C', '2S']).

So the new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2C', '2S'] → ['2C', '2C', '2S']. Wait, no. The new_piles is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → which is nothing.

Then [current_piles[x-1]] → ['2C'].

Then current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → current_piles[0:2] → ['2C', '2S'].

So the new list is ['2C'] + ['2C', '2S'] → ['2C', '2C', '2S']?

But the new number of piles is x-1 =3-1=2. But the new_piles has length 1 (from x-4=3-4= -1, so 0 elements) plus 1 (from [current_piles[x-1]]) plus 2 (from current_piles[x-3 : x-1] which is 0:2, 2 elements). So total 0+1+2=3 elements. But this is x-1=2 piles. So something's wrong.

Wait, no. Original x=3. After merging into x-3=0 (0-based index 0), the new x is 3-1=2.

But the new_piles is computed as per merging into x-3:

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] (x-4=3-4= -1) → empty.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] (current_piles[2] → '2C') → ['2C'].

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=0, x-1=2 → current_piles[0:2] → ['2C', '2S'].

So the new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2C', '2S'] → ['2C', '2C', '2S'], which has length 3. But the new x is 2. So this can't be right.

Ah, I see the mistake. For merging into x-3 when x=3, x-3=0 (1-based) → 0-based index 0. So the new list is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → x-4 is 3-4 = -1 → invalid. So this part is empty.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → current_piles[2] = '2C'.

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=0 (0-based index 0), x-1=2 (0-based index 1). So current_piles[0:1], which is ['2C'].

So new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2C'] → ['2C', '2C'], which has length 2. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the slicing. In Python, a slice a : b is up to but not including b. So current_piles[x-3 : x-1] when x-3=0 and x-1=2 is current_piles[0:2], which gives elements 0 and 1. But in the case where x=3, x-3=0 (original x-3=0 in 0-based?), and x-1=2 (original x-1=2 in 0-based). So the slice is 0:2 → elements 0 and 1.

But the new x is x-1=3-1=2. So the new list must have 2 elements. But in the example where x=3 and merging into x-3=0 (0-based), the new list is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → x-4=3-4= -1 → current_piles[0:-1] is invalid. So perhaps this is empty.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → current_piles[2] = '2C'.

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=0, x-1=2. So slice is 0:2 → ['2C', '2S'].

Wait, but x-1=2 (the new x is 3-1=2). So the new list should have 2 elements. But the code would generate 0 elements + 1 element + 2 elements → 3 elements. Which is impossible.

Ah, here's the problem: the formula for merging into x-3 is correct when x >=4, but for x <4, it's invalid. So merging into x-3 is only allowed when x >=4. So when x=3, merging into x-3 (0) is not allowed, because x-3=0, but x >=4 is required.

Ah, right! The problem states that merging into x-3 is possible only if x >=4. So for x=3, merging into x-3 is not allowed. So the example I was considering (x=3 and merging into x-3) is invalid. So for x=3, the only possible move is merging into x-1 (2), which requires the top cards of x and x-1 to match.

So in the example where we have 3 piles with ['2C', '2S', '2C'], x=3. The only possible move is to merge x=3 into x-1=2. But the top cards are '2C' and '2S', which do not match. So merging is not possible. Thus, the sample input's solution must have another path.

Wait, the first sample's solution is to merge the 4th pile onto the 1st (x-3=1). Then merge the 3rd pile onto the 2nd (x-1=2). Then merge the 2nd pile onto the 1st (x-1=1).

Wait, let's re-examine the sample input:

Sample Input 1:

4

2S 2S 2C 2C

Initial state: ['2S', '2S', '2C', '2C'].

Step 1: merge pile 4 (2C) into pile 1 (2S). So x=4, merging into x-3=1.

The new state after this move is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] (x-4=0, so current_piles[0:0] is empty) + [current_piles[x-1]] (current_piles[3] is '2C') + current_piles[x-3 : x-1] (x-3=1 → 0-based index 0? Wait, original x=4, x-3=1 (1-based) is 0-based index 0. So current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → current_piles[0:3-1=3-1=3? x-1 is 3 (0-based index 3), so current_piles[0:3] → elements 0, 1, 2. So the new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2S', '2S', '2C'] → ['2C', '2S', '2S', '2C']? No, that's not correct. Wait, the new number of piles after merging x=4 into x-3=1 is x-1=3. So the new state has 3 piles. How does the new_piles list look?

When x=4, merging into x-3=1 (0-based index 0):

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] → x-4=0, so current_piles[0:0] is empty.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → current_piles[3] is '2C'.

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=1 (0-based index 0), x-1=3 (0-based index 3-1=3?). Wait, x is 4, so x-3=1 (1-based) → 0-based index 0. x-1=4-1=3 (0-based index 3).

So current_piles[x-3 : x-1] is current_piles[0:3] → elements 0, 1, 2.

So new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2S', '2S', '2C'] → ['2C', '2S', '2S', '2C'] → length 4, but x-1=3. So this can't be right.

Hmm, this indicates that there's a mistake in the formula for merging into x-3.

Perhaps the correct formula for merging into x-3 when x >=4 is:

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

But for x=4, x-4=0, so current_piles[0:0] is empty. Then add [current_piles[3]] (which is '2C') and current_piles[x-3=1 (0-based index 0) : x-1=3 (0-based index 3)]. So slices current_piles[0:3], which is elements 0,1,2.

So new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2S', '2S', '2C'] → ['2C', '2S', '2S', '2C'] → length 4, but x-1=3. So this is incorrect.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the way we're calculating the new_piles for merging into x-3.

Another way to think about it: when merging into x-3 (1-based), the new x becomes x-1. The new list of piles is:

- All piles before x-3 (in 1-based) are kept.

- The x-3-th pile is merged with the x-th pile. The new x-3-th pile's top is the x-th pile's top.

- The piles between x-3+1 and x-1 are kept.

So, for x=4 (1-based), merging into x-3=1 (1-based):

The new list has x-1=3 piles. The new list is:

piles 1 (merged), 2, 3.

Wait, but in 1-based terms, the original piles are 1, 2, 3, 4. Merging 4 into 1 (x-3=1). The new piles are 1 (merged with 4), 2, 3. So the top cards are 4's top (2C), 2S, 2C.

So the new list is ['2C', '2S', '2C'].

But according to the previous formula, the new_piles would be:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → x=4, x-4=0. current_piles[0:0] is empty.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → current_piles[3] is '2C'.

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → x-3=1 (0-based 0), x-1=3 (0-based 3-1=3).

Wait, x is 4. x-3=1 (1-based), which is 0-based index 0. x-1=3 (0-based index 3). So current_piles[x-3 : x-1] is current_piles[0 : 3], which is elements 0, 1, 2.

So new_piles is [] + ['2C'] + ['2S', '2S', '2C'] → ['2C', '2S', '2S', '2C'] → which is 4 elements, but x-1=3. So this is wrong.

Ah, here's the mistake. The formula for merging into x-3 is correct only when x-3 is >=1 (1-based), which requires x >=4. But when x=4, x-3=1 (1-based), which is 0-based index 0. So the current_piles[x-3 : x-1] is current_piles[0 : 3] (since x-1=3, but in Python slicing, it's up to but not including. So current_piles[0 :3] gives elements 0,1,2.

But after merging, the new x is x-1=3. So the new_piles should have 3 elements, but according to the formula, it's 1 + 3 =4 elements. So there's a mistake in the formula.

Thus, the formula must be wrong. So what is the correct way to compute the new_piles after merging into x-3?

Let's try to re-derive it.

When merging the x-th pile (1-based) into x-3 (1-based), which is the (x-3)th pile (0-based index x-4), the new merged pile's top is the x-th's top. The new list of piles is:

Original list: 1, 2, ..., x-3, x-2, x-1, x.

After merging x into x-3:

- Piles 1 to x-4 remain.

- Pile x-3 is merged with x, resulting in a new pile whose top is x's top.

- Piles x-3+1 to x-1 (inclusive) remain.

Thus, the new list of piles is:

[1, 2, ..., x-4, merged_pile, x-3+1, x-3+2, ..., x-1].

In terms of indices (0-based):

Original indices: 0, 1, ..., x-4-1, x-4, x-3, x-2, x-1.

After merging x-1 (0-based) into x-4 (0-based):

New list is:

0 to x-5 (indices): original[0 : x-4]

merged_pile: original[x-1].top

then original[x-4+1 : x-1], which is original[x-4+1 : x-1].

So the new_piles is:

original[0 : x-4] + [original[x-1]] + original[x-4+1 : x-1]

Ah, this makes sense.

So for x=4 (0-based x-1=3):

new_piles = original[0 : 4-4=0] (empty) + [original[3]] + original[4-4+1 : 4-1 → 1:3 (indices 1 and 2)].

So original is [0:3], and original[1:3] is [1,2] (values).

Thus, new_piles = [] + [3's value] + [1, 2].

So new_piles has length 3, which is correct.

Thus, the correct formula for merging into x-3 (1-based) is:

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

Where x is the current number of piles (1-based), but in 0-based terms, current_piles is 0 to x-1.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

x is the current number of piles (1-based).

When merging into x-3 (1-based), which is 0-based index x-4.

The new_piles is:

current_piles[0 : (x-3) -1] → which is current_piles[0 : x-4-1], no. Wait, no.

Wait, the correct formula is:

For merging into x-3 (1-based):

The new list is:

original[0 ... (x-3-1)-1] → wait, this is getting messy. Perhaps the correct formula is:

new_piles = current_piles[0 : x-4] + [current_piles[x-1]] + current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

Where x is the current number of piles (1-based). For example, when x=4:

x-4 = 0 → current_piles[0:0] is empty.

x-3 is 1 (0-based index 0) → current_piles[0: x-1=3], which is current_piles[0:3], but x-3 : x-1 is 1-based x-3 to x-1-1.

Wait, perhaps this is better expressed in 0-based terms:

When the current number of piles is x (0-based, the number is x+1). But this is getting too confusing.

Perhaps it's better to implement the formula correctly based on the 0-based indices.

Let me re-derive the formula for merging into x-1 (1-based):

Current number of piles is x (1-based). Merging into x-1 (1-based), which is 0-based index x-2.

The new list is:

current_piles[0 ... x-2-1] (elements up to x-3) → current_piles[0 : x-2]

 + [current_piles[x-1]] 

This results in a new list of length (x-2) + 1 = x-1 (1-based x-1, which is correct).

For example, x=4 (1-based), 0-based index x=3.

current_piles[0 : x-2] → x-2=2 → current_piles[0:2] → elements 0,1.

+ [current_piles[3]] → elements 0,1, 3 → new list length 3, which is x-1=3 (1-based).

Yes, this is correct.

For merging into x-3 (1-based x-3):

Current number of piles is x (1-based). Merging into x-3 (1-based) which is 0-based index x-4.

The new list is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → elements 0 to x-4-1.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] 

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → elements x-3 (0-based) to x-2 (since x-1 is the end index, which is exclusive).

Wait, x is the current number of piles (1-based), so 0-based index for the last pile is x-1. So, merging into x-3 (1-based) is 0-based index x-4.

The new list is:

current_piles[0 ... x-4-1] (elements 0 to x-4-1) → length x-4 elements.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → 1 element.

+ current_piles[x-3 ... x-2] → elements x-3 (0-based) to x-2-1 (since x-1-1 = x-2).

Wait, x-3 (1-based) is 0-based index x-4. So, the original x-3 (1-based) is 0-based index x-4.

After merging, the new list should include:

- All piles before x-3 (1-based) → 0-based indices 0 to x-4-1.

- The merged pile (x-3 (1-based) merged with x (1-based)).

- All piles after x-3 (1-based) but before x (1-based) → 0-based indices x-4+1 to x-2.

Thus, the new list is:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → elements 0 to x-4-1.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] → merged top.

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1-1] → but x-3 is 0-based x-4 + 1? Not sure.

Alternatively, after merging, the new list includes:

elements before x-4 (0-based), then merged, then elements from x-3 (0-based) to x-2 (exclusive) → which is x-3 to x-2.

So:

current_piles[0 : x-4] → elements 0 to x-4-1.

+ [current_piles[x-1]] 

+ current_piles[x-3 : x-1]

Where x is the current number of piles (1-based).

For x=4 (1-based):

x-4=0 → current_piles[0 :0] is empty.

x-3 is 1 (1-based) → 0-based 0.

x-1 is 3 (0-based) → x-1 is 3.

current_piles[x-3 : x-1] → current_piles[0:3] → elements 0,1,2.

So new_piles is empty + [3's value] + [0,1,2] → length 4, which is incorrect.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the formula.

This indicates that the formula for merging into x-3 is incorrect, and perhaps the correct way is to take elements from x-3+1 (1-based) to x-1 (1-based), which would be 0-based x-3+1-1 to x-1-1.

But I'm getting stuck here.

An alternative approach is to write code that, given the current list of top cards, computes the possible next states for both merging into x-1 and x-3 (if applicable), and use BFS to explore all possible states, using a set to track visited states to avoid cycles.

But for n=52, this might not be feasible. However, given the time constraints, perhaps it's the only way to proceed.

So, the plan is:

- Represent the state as a tuple of the top cards of the piles.

- Use BFS to explore possible states.

- For each state, check if merging into x-1 or x-3 is possible.

- If any state reaches a single pile, return "YES".

- If all possibilities are exhausted and no such state is found, return "NO".

Now, the question is whether this code can handle n=52 within the time limits.

But even for n=52, the number of possible states can be very large. However, due to the constraints of the problem, perhaps many states are not reachable, and the BFS can complete in time.

Let's proceed to write this code.

The steps are:

1. Read the input cards.

2. Initialize the BFS queue with the initial state (list of cards).

3. For each state in the queue:

   a. If the length is 1, return "YES".

   b. Generate possible next states by merging into x-1 and/or x-3.

   c. For each next state, if not visited, add to the queue and mark as visited.

4. If queue is empty, return "NO".

The key is to represent the state as a tuple, since lists are not hashable.

Now, let's code this.

But in Python, tuples are hashable. So, for each state, we convert the list of top cards into a tuple and use a set to track visited states.

So, the code would look something like this:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
from collections import deque


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    cards = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()

    queue = deque()
    queue.append( tuple(cards) )
    visited = set()
    visited.add( tuple(cards) )

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        x = len(current)
        if x == 1:
            print("YES", file=output_stream)
            return
        # Check possible moves
        # Move 1: merge x-1 (1-based) -> 0-based x-2
        if x >= 2:
            # Check if current[-1] matches current[-2]
            if current[-1][0] == current[-2][0] or current[-1][1] == current[-2][1]:
                # new state is current[0 ... x-2-1] + [current[x-1]]
                new_list = list(current[:-2]) + [current[-1]]
                new_state = tuple(new_list)
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    queue.append(new_state)
        # Move 2: merge x-3 (1-based) -> 0-based x-4 (since x-3-1= x-4-1? No, 1-based x-3 is 0-based x-4)
        if x >=4:
            # Check if current[-1] matches current[-4]
            if current[-1][0] == current[-4][0] or current[-1][1] == current[-4][1]:
                # new_list = current[0 : x-4] + [current[x-1]] + current[x-3 : x-1]
                # in 0-based terms, current[x-4+0 ...x-4] (current[0 : x-4]) is current[:x-4]
                # current[x-3 : x-1] is current[x-4 :x-1-1] (since x-3 is x-4 in 0-based)
                new_list = list(current[:x-4]) + [current[-1]] + list(current[x-3 : x-1])
                new_state = tuple(new_list)
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    queue.append(new_state)

    print("NO", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \

            "output": \

        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')

The time and memory constraints are tight. For n=52, the BFS could have a lot of states. However, the problem's time limit is 2 seconds, which is 2,000 milliseconds. Python is relatively slow, but perhaps for the given constraints, the code can pass.

But for the worst case where each merge step has two possible options, the number of states would be 2^51, which is impossible. So the code would TLE for large n. However, in practice, the code may pass the test cases if the problem's test cases are designed in a way that allows the BFS to prune states quickly.

But given that n is up to 52, and the code uses BFS with pruning via a visited set, this approach may not be feasible for all cases. However, given the problem's description and the sample inputs, this seems to be the correct approach.

Another possible optimization is to use BFS with a deque and process states in the order they are added. Also, using tuples for the state and a set for visited is crucial.

Thus, the code should be correct, but may not pass the largest test cases due to time constraints. However, given the problem's constraints and the lack of any obvious alternative approach, this is the best possible solution.
