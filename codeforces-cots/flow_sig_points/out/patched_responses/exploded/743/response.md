Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum height of a pyramid given n cubes. The pyramid's levels are built such that the i-th level requires 1+2+...+i cubes. Wait, wait. Wait, the description says that the top level is 1 cube, the second has 3 (1+2), third 6 (1+2+3), etc. So each level i (starting from 1) requires the sum of 1 to i cubes. So for level 1: 1 cube, level 2: 3 cubes, level 3: 6, level 4: 10, and so on. The total cubes used for a pyramid of height h is the sum of the first h triangular numbers.

So the problem reduces to finding the largest h such that the sum of the first h triangular numbers is â‰¤ n.

The sum of the first h triangular numbers is known to be h*(h+1)*(h+2)/6. Wait, right? Because each triangular number is k(k+1)/2 for k from 1 to h. Summing that from k=1 to h gives the sum S = sum_{k=1 to h} k(k+1)/2 = [h(h+1)(h+2)] / 6. Let me confirm that formula. Let's see for h=1: 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. Correct. h=2: 2*3*4/6=24/6=4, which is 1+3=4. Yes. h=3: 3*4*5/6=60/6=10, which is 1+3+6=10. Yep. So the formula holds.

So the problem becomes finding the maximum h where h(h+1)(h+2)/6 â‰¤ n.

Given n, we need to compute the largest h for which this inequality holds. So the approach would be to compute this h efficiently.

Now, given that n can be up to 1e4, but perhaps even for larger n, we can compute h via binary search. Wait, but what's the maximum possible h for n up to 1e4? Let's see:

We can compute h where h^3/6 <= n. So h^3 <=6n. So for n=1e4, 6n=6e4, h^3 ~6e4, h is around cube root of 6e4 which is cube root of 60000. Cube of 39 is 59319, 40^3=64000. So h would be up to 40 or so. So even a linear search would work for n up to 1e4, since 40 iterations are negligible.

But for the sake of efficiency, even if binary search is overkill, perhaps a binary search approach would be better. Let's think.

But given the small possible h, even a loop that increments h until the sum exceeds n would be efficient. Let's think about the steps for h=1, 2, etc., compute the sum until it's larger than n, then return h-1.

For example, take the sample input 25:

h=4: sum is 4*5*6/6= 120/6=20. 20 <=25. Next h=5: 5*6*7/6=210/6=35>25. So maximum h is 4. Which matches the sample.

Another example, n=1: h=1 is 1, which is equal to 1. So output is 1.

So the approach can be:

Initialize h=0, sum=0. Iterate h from 1 upwards, compute the current sum. If sum exceeds n, return h-1. Otherwise, continue.

But how to compute the sum for each h? Using the formula h*(h+1)*(h+2)/6.

So the loop would be:

h starts at 1.

current_sum = h*(h+1)*(h+2)//6

if current_sum >n, then return h-1.

Else, increment h.

Wait, but for h=1, current_sum is 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n is 1, then current_sum is equal to n. So h is 1. If n is 1, then the loop would check h=1, sum=1. Since 1 <=1, increment h to 2, compute sum=2*3*4/6=24/6=4. Now 4>1, so return h-1=1. Which is correct.

So the steps would be:

Initialize h=0.

Loop:

h +=1

sum = h*(h+1)*(h+2)//6

if sum >n: break

so after breaking, the answer is h-1.

But wait, no. Because the sum is for h. So for example, when h=4, sum is 20. Which is <=25. Then h increments to 5, sum is 35. Which is >25. So the answer is h-1=4.

So the loop is:

start h=0, current_h=0.

Then, in each iteration:

h +=1

compute sum for h.

if sum >n: break.

then return h-1.

But how to handle the case where sum equals n exactly? Like n=1. Then sum is 1 when h=1. So sum is not >n. Then h increments to 2. sum is 4>1. So returns 2-1=1. Correct.

Another case: n=20. Then h=4: sum=20. Not >20, so h increments to 5. sum=35>20. So returns 4. Correct.

So the algorithm works.

So the code can be written as:

Read n.

Initialize h=0.

loop:

h +=1

current_sum = h*(h+1)*(h+2) //6

if current_sum >n:

    break

return h-1.

But how to implement this? In Python:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    h = 0
    while True:
        h += 1
        current = h * (h + 1) * (h + 2) // 6
        if current > n:
            break
    print(h - 1, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
25
""",
            "output": \
"""\
4
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Sample 2:

n=25.

h=4: current=4*5*6//6=20 <=25. h increments to 5: 5*6*7//6=35>25. Break. Output 4.

Yes.

Another test case: n=10. Output 3.

Another test case: n=35. Output 5.

Thus, the code works.

```python
n = int(input())
h = 0
while True:
    h += 1
    current = h * (h + 1) * (h + 2) // 6
    if current > n:
        break
print(h - 1)
```
