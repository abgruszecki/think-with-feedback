Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to pair 2k universities in a tree such that the sum of the distances between each pair is maximized. Let me think about the approach here.

First, the tree structure is important. Since it's a tree, the distance between any two nodes is the number of edges on the path connecting them. The problem is to pair the universities in a way that the sum of these pairwise distances is as large as possible.

Hmm. What's the maximum possible sum? Well, pairing the nodes that are as far apart as possible would contribute more to the sum. So, maybe the optimal way is to pair the nodes in such a way that each pair is as far apart as possible. But how do I efficiently compute that?

Wait, but when you have a tree, the maximum distance between any two nodes is the diameter. But since we need k pairs, perhaps the maximum sum can be achieved by pairing nodes such that each pair uses the longest available edges in some way. But how?

Alternatively, think about the problem of selecting pairs of universities such that the sum of their pairwise distances is maximized. This is similar to a matching problem where the edge weights are the distances between pairs, and we need a maximum weight matching. However, maximum matching in general graphs is O(n^3), which is impossible here since n can be up to 2e5. So we need a smarter approach.

But given that the tree is a special structure, perhaps there's a way to compute this without considering all possible pairs.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the tree's edges. Each edge contributes to the distance between pairs of universities that are in different subtrees when the edge is removed. So, for each edge, the number of pairs that will include this edge in their path is the minimum between the number of universities in one subtree and the number of universities in the other. But since each pair can only use each edge once (since the path between two nodes uses each edge once), the contribution of the edge to the total sum is (number of times it's used) multiplied by 2 (since each edge is part of the distance for each pair that crosses it). Wait, no. Wait, the distance between two nodes is the number of edges in their path. So each edge along the path between a pair contributes 1 to the distance. So the total sum is the sum over all edges of the number of pairs whose path includes that edge multiplied by 1. So each edge's contribution is the number of pairs that pass through it. So the maximum sum is the sum of (number of pairs passing through edge e) for all edges e.

So the problem reduces to, for each edge e, count how many pairs of universities have their path passing through e, and sum all these counts. And we need to maximize this sum.

But how do we arrange the pairs to maximize this sum? Because the way we pair the universities affects how many times each edge is counted.

Wait, but maybe for each edge, the maximum possible contribution is the minimum between the number of universities in each of the two subtrees that the edge connects. Let me see.

Suppose we split the tree into two parts by cutting edge e. Let a be the number of universities in one part, and b the number in the other. Since each pair that uses this edge must have one university in each part. The maximum number of such pairs is min(a, b). However, since each pair can only cross an edge once (as part of their path), but the sum of all edges along their path contributes to the total. So for each edge on the path between a pair, the edge's count increases by 1.

Wait, but the maximum possible sum would be achieved by maximizing the number of pairs that cross each edge as much as possible. So for each edge, the maximum possible contribution is the minimum of the count of universities in each subtree. Because if a subtree has a universities and the other has b, then the maximum number of pairs that can cross this edge is the minimum between a and b. But since the total number of pairs is k, perhaps this is constrained.

Wait, but how do these edges' contributions add up? Let me think of an example.

Take the first sample input. The tree is:

The roads are:

1-3, 3-2, 4-5, 3-7, 4-3, 4-6.

Wait, perhaps the tree structure is:

Let me visualize it. Maybe:

The tree is rooted at 4? Let's see:

Looking at the edges:

1 connected to 3.

3 connected to 2, 7, and 4.

4 connected to 5, 6, and 3.

So the edges are as follows. The sample input has 7 towns. The universities are in 1,5,6,2. So the count for each edge.

For example, the edge between 4 and 5. The subtree under 4 (if we split the tree by removing edge 4-5) has 5 in one part and the rest in the other. The universities in the subtree of 5 is 1 (only 5). The other part has 1,6,2. So a=1, b=3. The min is 1. So this edge can contribute 1 pair. But in the optimal pairing, how is this used?

In the sample, the pairs are 1-6 and 2-5. The path between 1 and 6 goes through edges 1-3, 3-4, 4-6. So the edge 4-5 is not part of this. The path between 2 and 5 uses edges 2-3, 3-4, 4-5. So edge 4-5 is used once. So its contribution is 1. Which matches the min(1,3) =1.

So for each edge, the maximum possible contribution is the minimum between the number of universities in the two subtrees when the edge is removed. But how does that add up to the total sum?

So the total maximum sum would be the sum over all edges of the minimum between a and (2k - a), where a is the number of universities in one subtree (the other being 2k -a). Because for each edge, the maximum number of pairs that can cross it is min(a, 2k -a), where a is the number of universities in one of the two subtrees.

So the approach is: For each edge, compute the number of universities in the subtree below it (assuming a certain root), and then the contribution is min(a, 2k -a). Summing all such contributions gives the maximum possible sum.

Wait, but why is this the case? Because when you split the tree by an edge, the number of pairs that can cross that edge is the minimum of the universities in each part. Because each pair that crosses uses one from each part, and the maximum possible is the minimum of the two.

Therefore, the total sum is the sum of min(a_e, 2k - a_e) for each edge e, where a_e is the number of universities in the subtree of e (the child part, when considering the parent as the root).

So the plan is:

1. Compute for each edge, the number of universities in the subtree that the edge connects to (the subtree that's a child of the parent node). For example, in a rooted tree, for each edge between a parent u and child v, the subtree under v has a certain number of universities. Then, the contribution of this edge is min(a_v, 2k - a_v), which is the same as a_v if a_v <=k, otherwise 2k -a_v (since 2k is the total number of universities).

Wait, wait. Let's see: 2k is the total number of universities. So for each edge e, when we split the tree into two parts, the count of universities in each part is a and (2k -a). The minimum of a and (2k -a) is the maximum possible number of pairs that can cross this edge. Because each pair that crosses the edge uses one from each part. So the maximum possible is min(a, 2k -a). Summing this over all edges gives the maximum possible sum.

So the key insight is that for each edge, its contribution is min(a_e, 2k -a_e), where a_e is the number of universities in the subtree of that edge. So the problem reduces to calculating for each edge the size of its subtree (in terms of universities) and then summing the min for each.

Therefore, the approach is:

- Find the number of universities in each subtree for every edge, then sum the min(a_e, 2k -a_e) for all edges.

But how to compute a_e for each edge?

This requires a traversal of the tree and a subtree count. We can build the tree, then perform a post-order traversal, counting the number of universities in each subtree. For each node, when we visit its children, we can accumulate the count from each child. Then, for each edge to a child, the a_e is the count in that child's subtree. So for each edge, the contribution is min(count, 2k - count).

So the steps are:

1. Read the input: n, k, the list of universities, and the edges.

2. Build the tree as an adjacency list. But since the tree is undirected, we need to represent it in a way that allows us to avoid revisiting the parent. So we can build a parent-children structure by choosing a root (like node 1) and then building the tree with parent pointers.

3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the root. For each node, compute the number of universities in its subtree. For each child, after calculating its subtree count, the edge from parent to child has a subtree count equal to the child's subtree count.

4. For each such edge (excluding the root's parent, which doesn't exist), compute min(child_count, 2k - child_count) and add it to the total sum.

Yes, because the subtree count for each child edge is the number of universities in that subtree. The other part (the parent's side) has 2k - child_count universities. So the min is the contribution.

So, the plan is:

- Read all the edges and build the tree as an adjacency list.

- Mark the universities (since the list of universities is given, create a boolean array to indicate which nodes are universities).

- Perform a post-order traversal to compute the subtree counts. For each node, its subtree count is the sum of the subtree counts of all children plus 1 if it is a university.

- For each edge (parent to child), the a_e is the subtree count of the child. The contribution is min(a_e, 2k - a_e). Sum all these contributions.

So the code steps:

Read n and k.

Read the list of universities. Let u be a list of 2k nodes. Create a boolean array is_uni of size n+1, initialized to False. For each x in u, set is_uni[x] = True.

Read the next n-1 lines and build the adjacency list. Since the tree can be represented as an adjacency list, but to avoid cycles during traversal, we need to build a rooted tree. So we'll pick a root (like 1), then build a parent array and children array. To avoid cycles, during the BFS or DFS, we can track parents.

But building the tree as a rooted structure can be done via a BFS or DFS. Let's choose root 1.

Then, perform a post-order traversal of the tree. For each node, compute the count of universities in its subtree. For each child, after processing the child, add the child's count to the current node's count.

For each edge from a parent to a child, the a_e is the child's count. So during traversal, for each child, we can compute the contribution (min(a_e, 2k - a_e)) and accumulate the total sum.

So the code:

- Build the adjacency list.

- Choose a root (any, say 1).

- Build a parent array and children adjacency list by traversing the tree (BFS or DFS).

- Then, perform a post-order traversal to compute the counts.

- For each edge (from parent to child), compute the contribution and add to the sum.

But how to represent the edges? Since each edge is between parent and child, except for the root, which has no parent.

Wait, during the traversal, when we build the tree structure, each node (except root) has a parent. So for each node (except root), the edge from parent to node is considered. For each such edge, the a_e is the count of universities in the subtree rooted at the node.

So during the post-order traversal, for each node (after processing all children), the count is 1 (if it's a university) plus the sum of the children's counts.

Then, for each child of the current node, we can calculate the contribution (min(child_count, 2k - child_count)) and add it to the total sum.

So in code:

sum_total = 0

def dfs(u, parent):
    count = 0
    if is_uni[u]:
        count +=1
    for v in adj[u]:
        if v != parent:
            child_count = dfs(v, u)
            sum_total += min(child_count, 2*k - child_count)
            count += child_count
    return count

Then, after the dfs, the sum_total is the answer.

Yes. Because for each child v of u, the edge u-v is split into a subtree (v's subtree) with child_count universities, and the other part (u's parent side) has 2k - child_count. So the contribution is min(child_count, 2k - child_count). Summing over all edges (each parent-child edge is processed once).

That makes sense.

So the code structure would be:

Read n and k.

Read the list of universities and mark is_uni.

Build the adjacency list.

Call dfs on the root (say, 1), with parent -1.

Sum all contributions from edges.

But the root's parent is -1, so the loop for v in adj[u] will process all children.

So in code:

n, k = map(int, input().split())

universities = list(map(int, input().split()))
is_uni = [False]*(n+1)
for u in universities:
    is_uni[u] = True

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
for _ in range(n-1):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    adj[x].append(y)
    adj[y].append(x)

total = 0

def dfs(u, parent):
    global total
    count = 0
    if is_uni[u]:
        count +=1
    for v in adj[u]:
        if v != parent:
            child_count = dfs(v, u)
            total += min(child_count, 2*k - child_count)
            count += child_count
    return count

# Start the DFS from root (assuming root is 1, but maybe it's better to pick any)
# However, the root choice doesn't affect the result, as the tree is processed properly.
dfs(1, -1)

print(total)

Wait, but what if the root is not a part of any university? It doesn't matter, because the code is handling the subtree counts correctly regardless.

Testing this on the first sample input.

Sample input 1:

7 2

1 5 6 2

The roads are as per the example. Let's see:

The universities are 1,5,6,2.

In the tree:

After building the adjacency list, the code will process each edge.

The root is 1. Then, during DFS:

Processing node 1, which is a university. Its count starts at 1.

Then, adj[1] is [3]. So v=3 (parent is 1's parent, which is -1). So process 3.

Now, 3's parent is 1. For 3:

Check if it's a university. 3 is not in the list. So count starts at 0.

adj[3] includes 1, 2, 7, 4. So processing children (excluding parent 1):

First, 2.

Processing node 2 (parent is 3). It's a university. So count becomes 1. Its children (adj[2] is 3 and others, but parent is 3, so process any children except 3. But in the sample input, node 2 is connected to 3. So no children except 3. So returns 1. Contribution for edge 3-2 is min(1, 4-1=3) → 1. So total +=1.

Then, node 7 (parent is 3). It's not a university. No children. Returns 0. Contribution is min(0, 4) → 0. So no addition.

Then node 4 (parent is 3). Processing node 4. It's not a university.

Adj[4] includes 5,6,3 (parent is 3). So process 5 and 6.

Node 5: is a university. So count is 1. No children except 4 (parent). So returns 1. Contribution for edge 4-5: min(1, 3) → 1. total +=1.

Node 6: is a university. No children except 4. So returns 1. Contribution edge 4-6: min(1,3) →1. total +=1.

Then, node 4's count is 0 (not a university) + 1 (5) +1 (6) → 2. Then, processing node 3's other children (like 4's parent is 3, so when processing 3's children, after 2,7,4, etc.).

Wait, let's see:

When processing node 4 (parent 3), after processing 5 and 6:

The count for node 4 is 0 (if it's not a university) plus 1 (5's count) +1 (6's count) → 2. Then, when returning to node 3's loop over children, node 4's child_count is 2. So contribution for edge 3-4 is min(2, 4-2=2) →2. So total +=2. So far, the contributions from edges 3-2 (1), 4-5 (1), 4-6 (1), 3-4 (2). Then, the edge 3-1's contribution is the count of 3's subtree. Wait, no. Wait, the edge between 3 and 1 is considered in the parent of 3, which is 1. So when processing node 3, which is a child of 1, the child_count is 1 (count of 3's subtree: 1 (node 2) +0 (7) +2 (4's subtree, which includes 5 and 6) → 3. So when processing the edge from 1 to 3, the child_count is 3. So contribution is min(3,4-3=1) →1. So adding 1 to the total.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

So the code's approach is correct.

Now, the code uses recursion. But for n up to 2e5, recursion in Python will hit the recursion limit (default is 1000). So this approach would cause a stack overflow for large trees (like a linear tree of 2e5 nodes). So, the code needs to be rewritten to use an iterative DFS (or BFS with post-order processing) to avoid stack overflows.

Yes. Python's recursion stack is limited. So for trees with depth up to 2e5, recursive DFS will fail. Therefore, we need to implement an iterative post-order traversal.

So the code must avoid recursion and use an iterative approach.

Therefore, the plan is to replace the recursive DFS with an iterative one.

Let me think about how to perform iterative post-order traversal for the tree, keeping track of the count of universities in each subtree.

An alternative approach is to use a stack, and track visited nodes. For each node, when we first process it, we push it to the stack with a flag indicating whether it's been processed. Then, for each child (excluding parent), we push them to the stack. Once all children are processed, we calculate the count for the current node.

But for trees, an alternative approach is to use parent pointers and track the children in reverse order.

Alternatively, here's a standard iterative post-order approach:

stack = [ (root, parent, visited) ]

But I need to track for each node, the parent and whether its children have been processed.

Another approach is to use a stack where each entry is a node, and a list of children to process.

But perhaps the easiest way is to use a stack that holds entries of (node, parent, iterator over children), and track the state.

For example:

Initialize stack with (root, parent, iterator of children). The iterator for the root's children would be all adjacent nodes except the parent.

For each node, when we process it, we first check each child (excluding parent) and push them onto the stack. But to process them in post-order, we need to process all children first.

Wait, here's a method for iterative post-order:

1. Push the root node into the stack. Also, track a visited set or a way to remember which children have been processed.

But perhaps the standard way is to push a node to the stack, then pop it. If it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited, push it back to the stack, and then push all its children (excluding parent) in reverse order. Then, when the node is popped again (after processing its children), we can process it.

Wait, here's a way:

stack = [ (root, parent, False) ]

while stack not empty:
    node, parent, visited = stack.pop()
    if not visited:
        stack.append( (node, parent, True) )
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != parent:
                stack.append( (child, node, False) )
    else:
        # process the node here (post-order)
        count = is_uni[node]
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != parent:
                # but how to get the child's count?
                # We need to track the counts of children
                # So perhaps we need a dictionary to store the counts.
                count += child_counts[child]
                contribution = min(child_counts[child], 2*k - child_counts[child])
                total += contribution
        child_counts[node] = count

Wait, but to track the counts, we need a way to store the counts of each child. So perhaps a dictionary (or array) called child_counts, which holds the count for each node.

So here's the plan:

- Initialize a stack for iterative post-order traversal.

- For each node, when it's popped and not visited, push it back as visited and push all children (excluding parent) onto the stack.

- When a node is processed (after processing all children), calculate its count as the sum of the children's counts plus its own university status.

- Then, for each child (excluding parent), the edge between this node and the child has a contribution of min(child_count, 2k - child_count). Sum this to the total.

So the code would look like this:

child_counts = [0]*(n+1)
stack = [ (1, -1, False) ]
total =0

while stack:
    node, parent, visited = stack.pop()
    if not visited:
        stack.append( (node, parent, True) )
        # Push children in reverse order to process them in order
        # since stack is LIFO. So if you process the first child first, push them last.
        for neighbor in reversed(adj[node]):
            if neighbor != parent:
                stack.append( (neighbor, node, False) )
    else:
        # Calculate the count for this node
        count = 0
        if is_uni[node]:
            count +=1
        # For each child (neighbor that's not parent)
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if neighbor != parent:
                count += child_counts[neighbor]
                contribution = min(child_counts[neighbor], 2*k - child_counts[neighbor])
                total += contribution
        child_counts[node] = count

print(total)

This should work.

Testing the first sample:

The child_counts array will store for each node the count of universities in its subtree.

For node 5: is_uni[5] is True. So count is 1. No children except parent. So contribution for edge 4-5 is min(1, 3) →1. Similarly for 6.

In the stack processing, for node 4:

When processed, its children are 5 and 6. For each, their contributions are added. Then, the count for node 4 is 2. Then, the edge between 3 and 4 contributes min(2,2) →2.

Yes.

This approach avoids recursion and thus can handle large trees without stack overflow.

So the code should be rewritten using an iterative post-order traversal.

Now, the code:

Read n and k.

Read universities and set is_uni.

Read edges and build adjacency list.

Initialize child_counts as a list of 0s of size n+1.

Initialize stack with root (1), parent (-1), and visited=False.

Process stack as described.

Sum the contributions.

Yes.

Now, code:

Roads:

Wait, perhaps the tree is structured with root 2. Let's see.

But regardless, the code processes all edges, and for each edge between parent and child, the contribution is computed.

Assuming the code correctly computes the sum, it should output 9.

But since the code works for the first sample, and the approach is correct, it should handle all cases.

Thus, the code should be correct.
