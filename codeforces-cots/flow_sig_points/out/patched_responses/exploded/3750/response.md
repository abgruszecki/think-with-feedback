Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimal possible length of the text after performing at most one abbreviation. An abbreviation involves replacing two non-overlapping equal segments of words with their first letters in uppercase. So the key is to find two such segments that when replaced, give the maximum possible reduction in the total length.

First, I need to understand what the abbreviation does. For a segment of k words, replacing it with their first letters (each is uppercase, so same length as a word's first letter) would save some space. The original length of the segment is sum of the lengths of each word plus the spaces between them. For example, a segment of 2 words "to be" has length 2 (to) + 1 (space) + 2 (be) = 5. Replacing it with "TB" (length 2) saves 5 - 2 = 3. But since we have two such segments, the total saving is twice that minus the replacement. Wait, no: each segment is replaced. So for each segment, the original length is (sum of word lengths) + (number of spaces between words in the segment), which is (sum of len(word) for words in segment) + (k-1), where k is the number of words in the segment. The abbreviation is the first letters of each word, which is k characters. So the saving per segment is (sum len words + (k-1)) - k = (sum len words -1) - (k-1) ? Wait, wait. Let me calculate.

Original segment: for a segment of m words (say m words from i to j, where j = i + m -1), the original length is sum(len(w_i) + ... + len(w_j)) + (m-1). Because each word is separated by a space. So for m words, m-1 spaces. The abbreviation is m characters (each first letter). So the saving per segment is (sum of lengths + m-1) - m = sum of lengths -1. So for each occurrence of the segment that we replace, the saving is (sum of lengths of its words) -1. Because sum + (m-1) is the original, minus m (the abbreviation length) gives sum -1.

But since we have to replace at least two occurrences, the total saving would be 2*(sum -1) - the original sum for two segments. But wait, each replaced segment contributes a saving of (sum of lengths of words in segment + (m-1)) - m. So for each occurrence, the saving is (sum + m-1) - m = sum -1. So if two occurrences are replaced, the total saving is 2*(sum -1) - (sum + m-1 * 2) ? No, no. Wait, no. Let's take an example.

Suppose a segment has m words. Each occurrence is of that segment. So for each occurrence, the original length is sum_words_in_segment + (m-1). The replacement is m characters. So the saving per occurrence is (sum_words + m-1) - m = sum_words -1. So two occurrences would save 2*(sum_words -1). So the total saving is 2*(sum_words -1). Because each occurrence contributes sum_words -1 saving. So the more occurrences we have, the more saving. But the problem says that we can perform at most one abbreviation. Wait, but the problem statement says: "at most one abbreviation". Wait, the problem says: "perform an abbreviation". So the abbreviation can replace multiple segments, but the way it's described is that you choose two or more non-overlapping equal segments and replace each. Wait, the problem says "at most one abbreviation"â€”but wait, the problem says "at most one abbreviation", but the abbreviation can consist of replacing multiple equal segments. For example, the first sample replaces two segments. So the process is: you can replace any number (at least two) of non-overlapping, equal segments. Each replacement is part of the same abbreviation. So the total saving is the sum of (sum_words_in_segment -1) for each replaced segment.

Wait, the problem says: "choose at least two non-intersecting equal segments of words, and replace each chosen segment with the string consisting of first letters...". So the abbreviation is replacing all chosen segments (must be at least two). So the saving is sum over each segment of (sum_words in segment -1). Because for each segment, the saving is (sum_words + (m-1)) - m = sum_words -1, where m is the number of words in the segment.

So the goal is to find two or more non-overlapping equal segments (same sequence of words) of length m (number of words in the segment). For each such possible m and possible sequences of words, find the maximum possible total saving (sum over each occurrence of (sum_words_in_segment -1)), then subtract that from the original total length.

So the approach would be:

1. Calculate the original total length. That's sum(len(word) for all words) + (n-1), since there are n words, so n-1 spaces.

2. Find the maximum possible saving by replacing two or more non-overlapping equal segments. The maximum saving possible is the maximum of all possible (sum_words -1) * k, where k is the number of segments replaced, but k >=2. The sum_words is the sum of the lengths of the words in the segment. So for example, if a segment has sum_words = 5 (sum of the words in the segment), then each occurrence contributes 4 to the saving. So if we replace two occurrences, total saving is 8.

3. The problem is to find the maximum possible saving over all possible segment lengths and all possible sequences of words, such that there are at least two non-overlapping occurrences of the segment.

Once we compute the maximum possible saving, subtract it from the original length to get the answer.

Now, the challenge is to efficiently find this maximum saving, considering that n can be up to 300. So n is small, but possible segment lengths can be up to 150 (since two segments of 150 words would require 300 words total). But for each possible segment length m, from 1 to n, we can check all possible possible sequences of m words and see how many non-overlapping occurrences they have. Then for each sequence that occurs at least twice, compute the sum of (sum_words -1) * number_of_occurrences, but only if the occurrences can be chosen in such a way that they are non-overlapping and at least two.

Wait, but even if a sequence occurs multiple times, the maximum possible k (number of replaced segments) may be more than 2, but using more than two would give a larger saving. For example, if a sequence appears 3 times, then replacing all three would save 3*(sum_words-1). But according to the problem statement, the abbreviation can replace at least two segments. So perhaps the maximum saving is the maximum over all possible (sum_words -1) * k, where k >=2 and the k occurrences are non-overlapping.

So for each possible segment (sequence of m words), find all possible positions where it occurs, and then select a subset of occurrences such that they are non-overlapping, and compute the maximum possible sum of (sum_words-1) multiplied by the number of selected occurrences (must be >=2). Then take the maximum over all these possibilities.

But how to do this efficiently?

The steps I need to take are:

For each possible segment length m (from 1 to n):

   For each possible starting index i in 0..n-m (assuming words are 0-based), the segment is words[i..i+m-1].

   For each such segment, compute its sum of word lengths (sum_len), and the key (the tuple of words in the segment).

   Then, for all occurrences of this key, collect their starting indices.

   For each group of occurrences (same key), find the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences possible, and compute the maximum possible (sum_len -1) * k, where k is the number of occurrences used (>=2).

The maximum over all such values is the maximum possible saving.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute the original total length.

2. For each possible m (from 1 to n):

   a. For each possible starting index i, compute the sum_len for the segment i to i+m-1.

   b. Create a hash map where the key is the tuple of words in the segment, and the value is a list of (i, sum_len).

3. For each group in the hash map (same key and m):

   a. The sum_len is the same for all entries (since the key is the same, sum of word lengths is the same).

   b. The sum_len for the segment is sum(w for w in words[i..i+m-1] len(w)).

   So for each group, sum_len is fixed, and saving per occurrence is (sum_len -1).

   c. Now, from the list of starting indices, we need to select as many non-overlapping as possible. Because each occurrence takes m words, so if one starts at i, the next can start at earliest at i + m.

   So the problem reduces to, for a list of sorted starting positions (sorted in increasing order), select the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences. Then, if that number is >=2, compute sum = (sum_len -1) * k, where k is the maximum possible occurrences (but at least 2).

   But since we need to maximize (sum_len-1)*k, the product, even if sum_len-1 is small but k is large, it could be better than a higher sum_len-1 but smaller k.

   So for each group, we need to compute the maximum possible (sum_len-1) multiplied by the maximum possible k (>=2) that can be selected from the occurrences.

So for each group (same key and m):

   The possible sum is (sum_len -1) * k, where k is the number of non-overlapping occurrences selected (k >=2).

We need to find the maximum such sum across all groups.

Therefore, the algorithm steps are:

For each m from 1 to n:

   For each possible i (from 0 to n -m):

      Compute the key (the sequence of words in the segment) and sum_len.

   Group all these segments by their key and m.

For each group:

   sum_saving_per = sum_len -1

   occurrences = sorted list of starting indices.

   Now, find the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences possible. To do that, since the segments are of length m, two segments can't overlap if their starting indices are i and j where j >= i + m.

   So for the list of sorted starting indices, which are in order, we can model this as the classic interval scheduling problem where each interval is [i, i + m -1], and we want to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.

   The maximum number can be found using a greedy approach: sort the intervals by end time (here, the end of the segment is i + m -1), and select as many as possible.

   Wait, but the starting indices are already in order. Let's say the starting indices are sorted in increasing order.

   To maximize the count, we can process them in order and select the earliest possible end.

   For example, we can track the last end. For each occurrence in order of increasing start:

      if start >= last_end + 1:

          count +=1

          last_end = start + m -1

   Wait, but the start is the first index of the segment (0-based). For a segment starting at i, it covers i, i+1, ..., i+m-1. So the next segment must start at >= i + m.

   So, in the list of starting indices (sorted), to select non-overlapping segments, each next segment must start at >= previous start + m.

   So the maximum number of non-overlapping segments can be found by greedily choosing the earliest possible next start.

   So the approach is to sort the starts, and then iterate through them, keeping track of the previous end. Each time, if the current start is >= previous end, we take it and update the previous end to current start + m -1 + 1 (since the next segment must start at previous end + 1). Wait, no: for a segment starting at i, the next segment must start at i + m or later.

   So for the current start, if it is >= previous_end + 1 (since previous_end is i_prev + m -1), then the next start can be i_prev + m.

   So the code would be:

   prev_end = -infinity

   count =0

   for start in sorted_starts:

       if start >= prev_end:

           count +=1

           prev_end = start + m

   So for example, if m=2, a start at 0 takes up 0 and 1. The next start must be >=0 +2 =2.

   So this is correct.

   So, for each group, we have a list of sorted starting indices. Then, we can compute the maximum possible count of non-overlapping segments using the above method.

   Then, if count >=2, the total saving is sum_saving_per * count.

   So for each group, compute this and track the maximum.

Thus, the overall steps are:

Compute original_length.

Compute the maximum possible saving by considering all possible groups.

If no group has a saving (i.e., no possible abbreviation), then the answer is original_length.

Else, the answer is original_length - max_saving.

Now, the problem is to implement this efficiently.

Now, considering that n is up to 300, and m can be up to 300 (but for m=300, there is only one possible segment), and for each m, the number of possible segments is up to 300 - m +1.

So for m=1, there are 300 segments. For m=150, 151 segments. So the total number of possible segments is O(n^2), which for n=300 is 300*301/2 = ~45,000. So that's manageable.

Each group is a tuple of the words in the segment (for that m). For example, for m=2, a group is a pair of words.

But for m up to 300, the key can be a tuple of up to 300 words. However, storing these tuples as keys in a hash map may be memory-intensive, but for n=300, m up to 300, the total possible unique keys are manageable. For example, m=1: each key is a single word. So the number is the number of distinct words. For m=2, the number is the number of distinct pairs of consecutive words, etc.

But even with m=300, the key is a tuple of 300 words. But in practice, the number of groups with the same key (i.e., same sequence of words) for large m is small. So this approach is feasible.

Now, the next step is to implement this.

But for each m and i, compute the key and sum_len.

For the sum_len: for each m, we can precompute prefix sums of the lengths of the words. Let's say sum_len[i] is the sum of the first i words. Then, the sum of words from a to b (0-based) is sum_len[b+1] - sum_len[a].

Wait, let's say sum_len is an array where sum_len[0] =0, sum_len[1] = len(word[0]), sum_len[2] = len(word[0]) + len(word[1]), etc. Then sum from a to b (inclusive) is sum_len[b+1] - sum_len[a].

But since the words are 0-based, the segment starts at i and includes m words: i, i+1, ..., i+m-1. So sum_len[i+m] - sum_len[i] is the sum of their lengths.

Thus, precomputing the prefix sums allows us to compute the sum_len for any segment in O(1) per query.

So first, precompute sum_len.

sum_len = [0] * (n+1)

for i in range(n):

   sum_len[i+1] = sum_len[i] + len(words[i])

Then, for segment starting at i with m words, sum_len[i+m] - sum_len[i] is the sum of the lengths of the words in the segment.

So that's manageable.

Now, for each m from 1 to n:

   for i from 0 to n -m:

       current_segment = words[i:i+m]

       key = tuple(current_segment)

       sum_segment = sum_len[i+m] - sum_len[i]

       saving_per = sum_segment -1

       Then, add (i, saving_per) to a dictionary grouped by key and m.

Wait, but for each group (key, m), saving_per is sum_segment -1. But sum_segment is sum of the words in the segment. Since all segments in the group have the same words, sum_segment is same for all. So for a group, saving_per is fixed.

So for a group, once we have the sum_segment (which is same for all occurrences), the saving per occurrence is (sum_segment -1). Then, for all occurrences in the group, we can collect their starting indices, and compute the maximum k (number of non-overlapping occurrences) possible, and then compute saving_per * k. The maximum of these across all groups is the maximum saving.

So the code steps:

precompute sum_len.

original_length = sum_len[n] + (n-1)

max_saving =0

for m in 1 to n:

   groups = defaultdict(list)

   for i in 0 to (n -m):

       current_segment = tuple(words[i:i+m])

       sum_segment = sum_len[i +m] - sum_len[i]

       groups[current_segment].append(i)

   for key in groups:

       occurrences = groups[key]

       if len(occurrences) <2:

           continue

       sum_saving_per = sum_segment -1  # sum_segment is the same for all entries in the group

       # Now, compute the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences in occurrences.

       # To compute the maximum k, we can sort the starts and use the greedy approach.

       starts = sorted(occurrences)

       k =0

       last_end = -1

       for start in starts:

           if start > last_end:

               k +=1

               last_end = start + m -1

       # Now, k is the maximum number of non-overlapping occurrences.

       if k >=2:

           current_saving = sum_saving_per * k

           if current_saving > max_saving:

               max_saving = current_saving

Thus, after checking all m and all groups, the maximum possible saving is max_saving. The answer is original_length - max_saving.

Wait, but in this code, sum_segment is calculated for each group. But for a group, all entries have the same sum_segment. Because the key is the same sequence of words, so each occurrence in the group has the same sum of lengths.

So yes, sum_segment can be calculated once for the group.

But wait, in the code above, for each group, sum_segment is calculated as sum_len[i +m] - sum_len[i], but for each occurrence in the group, the sum may vary. Wait, no. Because the group is created by the key (the sequence of words in the segment). So if two segments have the same words, then the sum of their lengths is the same. For example, if a segment has words ["a", "ab"], then sum of lengths is 1+2=3. Another occurrence of the same sequence will also have sum 3. So yes, sum_segment is the same for all occurrences in the group. Therefore, for a group, sum_segment can be computed once.

But in the code above, when we process each group, how do we get sum_segment? Because for each occurrence in the group, we added the starting index. But in the code as written, sum_segment is computed for each occurrence, but stored as part of the group's data. Wait, no. In the code above, the code for m in 1 to n:

   for each i in 0 to n-m:

       current_segment = tuple(words[i:i+m])

       sum_segment = sum_len[i+m] - sum_len[i]

       groups[current_segment].append(i)

But in this code, sum_segment is not stored. The group's key is the tuple of words, and the value is a list of i's.

Wait, but sum_segment is sum of the words in the current_segment, which is the same for all occurrences in the group. So to compute sum_segment for the group, we can compute it once for any occurrence in the group. For example, take the first occurrence's i, compute sum_len[i+m] - sum_len[i].

So in the code, when processing the group, sum_segment can be computed as sum_len[starts[0] +m] - sum_len[starts[0]].

But what if starts[0] is not the first occurrence? No, the starts are sorted, but for the group's sum_segment, any occurrence in the group can be used. For example, the first occurrence's i is starts[0], but since all occurrences have the same key (same sequence), sum_len[i +m] - sum_len[i] is same for all i in the group.

Thus, in the code, after grouping, for each group:

sum_segment = sum_len[starts[0] +m] - sum_len[starts[0]]

Then, sum_saving_per = sum_segment -1

But this is incorrect, because starts[0] is the first starting index in the list of starts, which may not be the first occurrence. Wait, but the starts are stored as per i in the loop, which for each m, the groups are built by adding i for each occurrence. So the group's list is all the i's where the segment starts. So the sum_segment for the group can be computed once as sum_len[i +m] - sum_len[i], where i is any of the starts in the group.

So in the code, after getting the list of starts, sum_segment can be computed as sum_len[starts[0] + m] - sum_len[starts[0]].

So in code:

for each group in groups:

   starts = sorted list of i's in the group.

   if len(starts) <2: skip.

   sum_segment = sum_len[starts[0] + m] - sum_len[starts[0]]

   sum_saving_per = sum_segment -1

   then proceed as before.

But why is sum_segment the same for all starts in the group? Because the group is made up of segments that have the same sequence of words. So all the segments in the group have the same sum of lengths. So sum_segment is the same for all.

Thus, the code can be written as:

precompute sum_len.

original_length = sum_len[n] + (n-1)

max_saving =0

for m in range(1, n+1):

   group_dict = defaultdict(list)

   for i in range(n - m +1):

       current_segment = tuple(words[i:i+m])

       group_dict[current_segment].append(i)

   for seg, starts in group_dict.items():

       if len(starts) <2:

           continue

       # compute sum_segment for this segment

       sum_segment = sum_len[starts[0] +m] - sum_len[starts[0]]

       sum_saving_per = sum_segment -1

       # compute maximum non-overlapping count

       starts_sorted = sorted(starts)

       k =0

       last_end = -1

       for start in starts_sorted:

           if start > last_end:

               k +=1

               last_end = start + m -1  # the end index is start + m -1

       if k >=2:

           current_saving = sum_saving_per * k

           if current_saving > max_saving:

               max_saving = current_saving

Thus, this code should work.

But now, what about the time complexity?

For each m from 1 to 300 (n=300):

   For each i from 0 to (300 -m):

       create a tuple of m words. For m=300, that's 300 elements per tuple. For m=1, it's 1 element. The total number of tuples is O(n^2) = 300*300=90,000.

   For each group in group_dict:

       process the list of starts. For each group, the processing of starts is O(k), where k is the number of starts. The sum over all groups for a particular m is O(n), since each i is in exactly one group for that m.

So the total processing for each m is O(n), so for all m, it's O(n^2). For n=300, that's 90,000 operations. Which should be manageable.

But building the tuple of words for each i and m might take O(m) time. So for each i and m, the time is O(m). So total time across all i and m is sum_{m=1 to n} (n -m +1)*m) = O(n^3). For n=300, this is 300*300*300=27,000,000 operations. Which is acceptable, as Python can handle that in 1 second.

Wait, but 27 million operations might be tight for Python. Let's think. For example, for m=300, there's 1 tuple (i=0). For m=299, 2 tuples, etc. So the sum is sum_{m=1 to 300} (301 -m) * m) = sum_{k=1 to 300} k*(301 -k) = sum from k=1 to 300 of (301k -k^2) = 301*(300*301)/2 - (300*301*601)/6.

But regardless, for n=300, it's O(300^3) which is 27 million. Each iteration involves creating a tuple of m words, which for m=300 is 300 elements. That's 27 million * 300 elements? Wait, no. For each i and m, the code creates a tuple of m elements. So the total number of elements processed is sum_{m=1 to 300} (300 -m +1)*m) = sum_{m=1 to 300} m*(301 -m). Which for m=150 is 150*151=22,650. The sum is O(n^3) as before. So for 300, the sum is (300*301*300)/2 - sum of m^2 up to 300. Let's approximate: sum_{m=1 to n} m(n+1 -m) = (n+1) sum m - sum m^2 = (n+1)(n(n+1)/2) - n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) = (n^2(n+1))/2 + ... Well, for n=300, it's roughly 300^3 / 2 = 13,500,000. So 13 million tuples, each with up to 300 elements. For Python, creating tuples can be a bit slow. So this may be tight for the time constraints.

Hmm. But in practice, the problem may require optimizing this.

Alternative approach: precompute all possible m and i, and for each, create a hash key that can be computed in O(1) time, such as a rolling hash. That way, we can avoid creating large tuples. But implementing rolling hash for variable-length m is possible but complex.

Alternatively, since the words can be up to, say, 1e5 in total, but n is 300, perhaps we can precompute a hash for each position and m, using a polynomial rolling hash.

For example, precompute a hash array where hash[i][m] is the hash of the segment starting at i with m words.

But for each i and m, the hash can be computed using a base and mod. However, for m up to 300, this would require O(n^2) precomputation. But even that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, for each possible m, compute the hash of each possible i by combining the words in the segment. But for Python, tuples are hashable and can be used as keys. However, creating tuples for m=300 is O(m) time per key. Which for m=300 and i=0, it's 300 words. So 300*300=90,000 operations for m=300. But for m=300, there's only one segment (i=0). So for m=300, the total processing is 1 * 300 =300 steps.

But for m=150, there are 151 segments, each with 150 words. So 151 * 150 = 22,650 steps. For m=100, 201 segments * 100 words = 20,100 steps.

The sum for all m from 1 to 300 is O(n^3) steps. For n=300, this is 27 million steps. Which may be too slow in Python.

Thus, to optimize this, perhaps we can precompute the tuple for each i and m in a more efficient way. Or find a way to compute a unique key for each segment without building the entire tuple.

Alternatively, since the words are compared in order, perhaps we can use a trie structure. But this seems complicated.

Alternative idea: for each possible m, iterate through all possible i, and compute a unique key for the segment words[i:i+m] using a combination of the hash values of each word, so that the key can be built in O(m) time but perhaps in a faster way than creating a tuple.

But even creating the tuple is O(m) time, so maybe it's not possible.

But perhaps using a rolling hash for the sequence of words. For example, precompute the hash of each word, then for a segment i of m words, compute the hash as (hash(word[i]) * P^(m-1) + hash(word[i+1]) * P^(m-2) + ... + hash(word[i+m-1])) mod some large mod. But even this would require O(m) time for each i and m, which is the same as creating a tuple.

So this approach may not save time.

Alternatively, precompute for each position i, a list of hash prefixes. For example, precompute a prefix hash array for each possible m up to 300. But this would require O(n^2) time and space.

Another idea: note that for two segments to be the same, their words must be the same in order. So, for a given m, the key is the list of words in the segment. But when m is large, it's possible that many segments are unique. So perhaps, for m larger than a certain value (like m>30), the number of groups is small, so the processing is manageable.

But in the worst case, for m=1, the number of groups is equal to the number of distinct words. For m=300, it's 1 group. So perhaps the code can handle it.

But in Python, tuples are handled efficiently. So perhaps the code as written is acceptable. Let's test the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

6

to be or not to be

For m=2:

segments are:

0: to be

1: be or

2: or not

3: not to

4: to be

So group for "to be" has starts [0,4]. sum_segment is len("to") + len("be") = 2+2=4. So sum_saving_per is 4-1=3.

Processing starts_sorted [0,4]. Check if 0 can be taken: yes. last_end becomes 0+2-1=1. Next start is 4, which is >1. So k=2. current_saving =3*2=6. original_length is sum(2+2+2+3+2+2) +5=13+5=18. 18 -6=12. Which matches the sample.

Sample Input 2:

10

a ab a a b ab a a b c

For the group with m=4, the segments [1..4] (ab,a,a,b) and [5..8] (ab,a,a,b). The sum_segment is len(ab)+a+a+b = 2+1+1+1=5. sum_saving_per is 5-1=4. The two occurrences. So current_saving is 4*2=8. original_length is sum of the words (1+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1) =12, plus 9 spaces gives 21. 21-8=13, which matches.

But according to the code, the code would process m=4. For the group with segments (ab, a, a, b), sum_segment is 2+1+1+1=5. sum_saving_per is 4. The starts are 1 and 5. The code sorts the starts [1,5]. For start=1: takes it. last_end=1+4-1=4. Next start is 5>4, so k=2. current_saving is 4*2=8. Which is correct.

Sample Input 3:

6

aa bb aa aa bb bb

Sample Output is 11. The optimal is replacing two segments of two words each: "aa bb" appears at positions 0 and 2 (but wait, the code may find that. Let's see.

Original_length: sum(aa (2) + bb(2) + aa(2) + aa(2) + bb(2) + bb(2)) = 12. Plus 5 spaces: 17. So output is 11. So saving is 6.

Looking for segments where sum_saving_per *k is 6. For example, two segments of 2 words each, sum_segment=2+2=4. sum_saving_per=3. 3*2=6.

So code should find this. For m=2, the segments:

0: aa bb (sum=4) â†’ sum_saving_per=3.

Occurrences: starts 0, 2 (since segments [0,1] and [2,3] is aa aa, perhaps. Wait, no. Let's see:

The words are:

0: aa

1: bb

2: aa

3: aa

4: bb

5: bb

For m=2, the possible segments:

0: [aa, bb] â†’ sum 4.

1: [bb, aa] â†’ sum 3.

2: [aa, aa] â†’ sum 4.

3: [aa, bb] â†’ sum 3 (words 3 and 4: aa and bb? Wait, positions 3 and 4 are aa (3) and bb (4). So sum is 2+2=4. So segment starts at 3 is [aa, bb], sum 4.

4: [bb, bb] â†’ sum 4.

So the group for [aa, bb] has starts 0, 3. So sum_saving_per is 4-1=3. The maximum non-overlapping is 2 (starts 0 and 3). 0 +2=2 â†’ end at 1. Next start is 3 >= 1+1=2. So yes. k=2. 3*2=6.

Another possible group is [aa, aa] (start 2). Only one occurrence. Not useful.

Another group is [bb, aa] (start 1). Only one occurrence.

Another group is [bb, bb] (start 4). Only one occurrence.

So the maximum saving is 6. So original_length 17 -6=11.

Thus, the code works.

So the code seems correct.

Now, in Python, tuples are hashable. But for large m, creating a tuple of m elements may take time. For m=300, each tuple has 300 elements, but in practice, since there's only one such tuple per group, it's manageable.

So the code as written should work.

Now, let's proceed to implement this.

But in code, the words are read as a list. So:

n = int(input())

words = input().split()

Then precompute sum_len:

sum_len = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

    sum_len[i+1] = sum_len[i] + len(words[i])

original_length = sum_len[n] + (n-1)

max_saving =0

for m in range(1, n+1):

    groups = defaultdict(list)

    for i in range(n - m +1):

        current_segment = tuple(words[i:i+m])

        groups[current_segment].append(i)

    for seg, starts in groups.items():

        if len(starts) <2:

            continue

        sum_segment = sum_len[starts[0]+m] - sum_len[starts[0]]

        sum_saving_per = sum_segment -1

        starts_sorted = sorted(starts)

        k =0

        last_end = -1

        for start in starts_sorted:

            if start > last_end:

                k +=1

                last_end = start + m -1

        if k >=2:

            current_saving = sum_saving_per *k

            if current_saving > max_saving:

                max_saving = current_saving

answer = original_length - max_saving

print(answer)

Wait, but in the code above, for each group in groups.items(), the sum_segment is computed based on starts[0], which is the first occurrence in the group. However, starts are not necessarily sorted. Because in the code, when building groups, the starts are added in the order of i. But for each group, starts could be in any order. So when we compute starts_sorted = sorted(starts), the starts[0] in the list is the first occurrence. But the code uses starts[0] to compute sum_segment, which is correct because all occurrences in the group have the same sum_segment.

But in Python, the starts list for a group can be in any order. So the code uses the first element of the group's starts list, which may not be sorted. But that's okay because any element in the group's starts list can be used to compute sum_segment.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, let's test the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

6

to be or not to be

sum_len is:

sum_len[0] =0

sum_len[1] =2 (to)

sum_len[2] =4 (to + be)

sum_len[3] =6 (to + be + or)

sum_len[4] =9 (to be or not)

sum_len[5] =11 (to be or not to)

sum_len[6] =13 (to be or not to be)

original_length =13 +5 (spaces) =18.

For m=2:

groups for the segments "to be" will have starts [0,4]. sum_segment is 2+2=4. sum_saving_per is 3.

Processing starts_sorted [0,4]:

k starts at 0, last_end -1.

start=0: 0 >-1 â†’ k=1, last_end=0+1=1.

start=4:4>1 â†’ k=2. So current_saving=3*2=6.

Which is the maximum_saving.

Thus, answer is 18-6=12.

Sample 2:

n=10

words = ['a', 'ab', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'ab', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c']

sum_len is:

sum_len[0] =0

sum_len[1] =1 (a)

sum_len[2] =1+2=3 (ab)

sum_len[3] =3+1=4 (a)

sum_len[4] =4+1=5 (a)

sum_len[5] =5+1=6 (b)

sum_len[6] =6+2=8 (ab)

sum_len[7] =8+1=9 (a)

sum_len[8] =9+1=10 (a)

sum_len[9] =10+1=11 (b)

sum_len[10] =11+1=12 (c)

original_length is 12 (sum) +9 (spaces) =21.

The code for m=4:

Looking for segments of length 4. One group is [ab, a, a, b] (words[1-4] and words[5-8]).

sum_segment for starts[0] (i=1) is sum_len[5] - sum_len[1] =6 -1 =5. sum_saving_per is 5-1=4.

starts are [1,5]. sorted as [1,5].

k=2. current_saving=4*2=8. So original_length -8=13.

Which matches the sample.

Sample 3:

n=6

words = ['aa', 'bb', 'aa', 'aa', 'bb', 'bb']

sum_len:

sum_len[0] =0

sum_len[1] =2

sum_len[2] =4

sum_len[3] =6

sum_len[4] =8

sum_len[5] =10

sum_len[6] =12.

original_length=12+5=17.

Looking for m=2. The group ['aa','bb'] has starts 0 and 3 (positions 0 and 3). sum_segment is 2+2=4. sum_saving_per 3. starts_sorted [0,3]. So k=2. current_saving=6. 17-6=11.

Thus, the code works.

So the code is correct.
