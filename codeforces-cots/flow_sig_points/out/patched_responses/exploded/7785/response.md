Okay, let's see. The problem is about cutting a convex polygon with k non-intersecting chords (except at vertices), such that after all the cuts, the smallest region's area is maximized. And we need to output twice that area. Hmm. So the key here is to find a way to partition the polygon into regions with cuts, and the minimal area among them is as large as possible.

First, let's think about the structure of the cuts. Since the polygon is strictly convex, any two non-adjacent vertices form a chord that's a diagonal. The cuts must not cross each other except at vertices. So, the arrangement of the cuts must form a non-crossing set of diagonals. These diagonals effectively divide the polygon into smaller regions. The goal is to choose k such diagonals in a way that the smallest resulting region is as large as possible.

Wait, but when you add a diagonal, it splits the polygon into two parts. But with multiple diagonals, perhaps the structure becomes a planar graph. But how do these cuts divide the polygon? It might form a structure where each region is a triangle, but since k can be up to n-3, which is the maximum number of non-crossing diagonals for a convex polygon (forming a triangulation), but here we can have up to k = n-3, which would split the polygon into n-2 triangles. Wait, but in that case, if all regions are triangles, then the minimal area would be the smallest triangle. So the problem reduces to choosing k cuts such that after adding them, the minimal area of the resulting regions is maximized.

But how to model this? Let's think recursively. For a convex polygon, each diagonal splits it into two smaller convex polygons. So adding a diagonal can split the problem into two smaller subproblems. But since we want to maximize the minimal area, maybe this is a dynamic programming problem where the state is a polygon (defined by some vertices) and the number of cuts left, and the value is the maximum possible minimal area after using those cuts.

But the problem is that the polygon can have up to 200 vertices, and k up to 197 (if n is 200), so a dynamic programming approach with states for all possible polygons and cuts left might be feasible.

Wait, let's think: the maximum possible number of states. Each polygon is a consecutive sequence of vertices. For example, in a polygon with vertices 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, a sub-polygon could be from i to j (in order). So for each possible interval [i, j) (mod n?), and the number of cuts left in that sub-polygon. But how?

Alternatively, the problem is similar to optimal polygon triangulation, where the goal is to split the polygon into triangles such that some optimal condition is met. For example, the maximum sum of triangle areas, or the minimum maximum area. But in this case, the problem is to split into regions (not necessarily all triangles) with up to k cuts, and then find the maximum possible minimal area.

Wait, but the optimal strategy would be to split the polygon into k+1 regions (since each cut increases the number of regions by 1, starting from 1 region for 0 cuts). Wait, no. Wait, each cut (if non-intersecting) adds one region. So with k cuts, the number of regions is k+1. Wait, is that correct? For example, a convex polygon with 0 cuts is 1 region. Adding one cut (a diagonal) splits it into 2 regions. Adding another cut that is a diagonal in one of the two regions splits that region into two, so total 3. So each cut increases the regions by 1. So with k cuts, it's k+1 regions. Wait, but the problem allows up to k cuts. So for k cuts, the regions are k+1. But then, the minimal area among these regions needs to be maximized.

Wait, but how to split into k+1 regions such that the smallest one is as large as possible. This seems like a problem where we want all regions to be as equal as possible. But how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to split the polygon into k+1 convex polygons (regions) such that all of them are as large as possible. The minimal among them would then be maximized.

But how to split the original polygon into k+1 regions with non-crossing diagonals such that the minimal area is maximized.

An approach that comes to mind is dynamic programming. The idea is to consider a polygon defined by the vertices from i to j (in order), and the number of cuts allowed in that polygon, and compute the maximum possible minimal area. However, the challenge is that each cut can split a polygon into two parts, and the minimal area would be the minimum of the minimal areas of the two parts.

Let me formalize this. Suppose we have a polygon defined by vertices v_i, v_{i+1}, ..., v_j. For a certain number of cuts m allowed in this polygon, we can make a cut between i and some vertex k (where k is between i+1 and j-1, but non-adjacent). Splitting the polygon into two polygons: left (i to k) and right (k to j). Then, the minimal area for this split would be the minimum between the optimal minimal areas of the left and right polygons with their respective allowed cuts. We need to choose the split point k and the distribution of cuts between left and right such that the minimal of the two is as large as possible.

This seems like a possible DP approach. Let's model it with DP[i][j][m], which represents the maximum possible minimal area when the polygon is from vertex i to j (in order) and we have m cuts allowed.

The base case is when m = 0. Then, the area is the area of the polygon from i to j. Wait, but if there are no cuts, the region is the entire polygon. But wait, when we have a polygon and make m cuts, the number of regions is m + 1. Wait, no. Wait, each cut increases the number of regions by 1. So with m cuts, the number of regions is m + 1. But how does that apply to a sub-polygon?

Hmm, perhaps the DP state is DP[i][j][m], which represents the maximum possible minimal area when we can make m cuts in the polygon i..j, and the minimal area is maximized. For each possible split, we need to split m into m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 + 1 = m. Because making a cut between i and k divides the problem into two sub-polygons (i to k and k to j), each with m1 and m2 cuts. Since the current cut uses one of the m cuts (the +1), and then the sum m1 + m2 = m-1. Then, the minimal area for this split is the minimum of the DP for left and right. The DP[i][j][m] would take the maximum over all possible splits and distributions of m1 and m2.

But how to compute the area of the polygon i..j. Wait, but the polygon from i to j in order (assuming that the original polygon is convex) is itself a convex polygon. So the area can be computed using the shoelace formula.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute the area of all possible sub-polygons (i to j) in the original polygon.

2. For the DP transitions, for each possible i, j, m, iterate over possible split points k, and possible splits of m-1 cuts into m1 and m2.

3. For each split, the minimal area is min(DP[i][k][m1], DP[k][j][m2]). The DP[i][j][m] is the maximum of all such possible min values.

But the problem is that the number of possible i, j pairs is O(n^2), and for each m up to k (which can be up to 200-3=197), the DP states would be O(n^2 * k), which for n=200 and k=197 would be 200*200*197 = around 8 million. And for each state, the transitions would involve O(n) possible k splits and O(m) possible m1 and m2. That might be too slow.

Alternatively, for each split, m1 can range from 0 to m-1, and m2 would be m-1 - m1. So for each split k, the possible splits of m-1 into m1 and m2 is O(m) possibilities. So for each state, the total transitions per state would be O(n * m) steps. For 8 million states, each with up to 200 * 200 steps (n=200, m=200), this could be computationally intensive. But maybe n=200 is manageable with memoization and optimizations.

But wait, let's see: n is up to 200. So the possible (i, j) pairs are O(n^2) = 200^2 = 40,000. For each (i,j), m can be up to 197, leading to 40,000 * 197 = 7,880,000 states. For each state, for each possible split k (between i+1 and j-1, non-adjacent), and for each possible split of m-1 cuts into m1 and m2 (m1 ranges from 0 to m-1, m2 = m-1 - m1). The split into m1 and m2 would require considering all possible values of m1 (from 0 to m-1). So for each state and split k, the number of splits is m options (since m1 can be 0 to m-1). But when m is up to 197, this is 197 options per split k. And for each split k, which could be up to O(n) possibilities (since j-i-2 possible splits for a polygon from i to j). So per state, the number of transitions is O(n * m), which for 7.88 million states would be O(7.88e6 * 200 * 200) operations. That's way too big. Wait, 7.88e6 * 200 * 200 = 315,200,000,000 operations. That's way beyond feasible for Python, which can handle maybe 1e8 operations per second. So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm, so perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem again.

Alternative approach: Since the polygon is convex and all cuts are non-intersecting, the cuts form a planar graph. Each cut is a diagonal that splits the polygon into two parts, and each additional cut is applied to one of the resulting parts. So the entire process is like building a tree of splits. The minimal area is the minimum of all the leaves in this tree (the regions that can't be split further with the available cuts).

The problem requires that after k cuts, the minimal region's area is as large as possible. To maximize this, we need to split the polygon into regions that are as balanced as possible. For example, if we split the polygon into k+1 regions with all areas as equal as possible, then the minimal area would be maximized.

But how to model this. Maybe the optimal way is to split the polygon into k+1 regions, each of which is a convex polygon, and their areas are as equal as possible.

But how to compute this. Let's think recursively. Suppose the original polygon's area is A. We want to split it into m regions (m = k+1) such that the smallest of them is as large as possible. The optimal split would be to split the polygon into m regions each of area at least A/m, and as equal as possible.

But how to split the convex polygon into m regions with non-crossing diagonals. For that, perhaps the best way is to perform a triangulation-like approach, but making sure that each split increases the number of regions and that each split is done in a way that maximizes the minimal area.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to split the polygon into m regions by choosing m-1 non-overlapping diagonals such that all the regions are as equal in area as possible.

But how to find such a split. Maybe dynamic programming can help here, but with a different state definition.

Alternative idea: The problem is similar to the problem of dividing a polygon into m regions (with m-1 non-crossing diagonals) such that the minimal area is maximized. This is a problem that can be approached using dynamic programming, but with the state representing a polygon (a range of vertices) and the number of splits allowed in it, the maximum possible minimal area.

So, the DP[i][j][m] is the maximum possible minimal area when splitting the polygon i..j with m splits (resulting in m+1 regions). Wait, but m here would be the number of splits allowed for that sub-polygon. For the original problem, m is k, which is the number of splits allowed. So the total regions would be m+1 = k+1.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let's re-examine the problem. Each split increases the number of regions by 1. So for a given polygon, if we have m splits allowed, the number of regions is m+1. Each split divides the polygon into two parts, each of which can have their own splits. So for a polygon i..j, the maximum possible minimal area when allowed to split into m+1 regions is DP[i][j][m]. The base case is m=0, which is the area of the polygon itself (since 0 splits means 1 region). For m>0, we can split the polygon into two parts, with some splits allocated to each part. For example, if we split into two parts with m1 and m2 splits (m1 + m2 + 1 = m), then each part's minimal area is their DP value. The overall minimal area for this split is the minimum of the two parts. We need to choose the split (k) and the allocation (m1, m2) to maximize this minimal value.

Wait, but how does the splitting work? For a polygon i..j, when we split it with a diagonal from i to k, this splits the polygon into two smaller polygons: i..k and i..j (or maybe i..k and k..j, but need to be precise). Let's think in terms of the original polygon's vertices. Suppose the original polygon is ordered as v0, v1, ..., vn-1. A sub-polygon from i to j (i < j) is the polygon formed by vertices i, i+1, ..., j. If i > j (due to wrap-around), but since the polygon is given in order, perhaps we can arrange the indices in a circular fashion. But perhaps it's easier to consider the polygon as being linear, with the vertices in order, and when j is less than i, wrap around. But for a convex polygon, any consecutive sequence of vertices in order forms a convex polygon.

So when splitting the polygon i..j (with j > i) using a diagonal from i to k (where k is between i+1 and j-1), the two resulting polygons are i..k and k..j. Then, for each of those, we can allocate m1 and m2 splits (m1 + m2 + 1 = m). The minimal area for this split is the minimum of the DP[i][k][m1] and DP[k][j][m2]. The DP[i][j][m] is the maximum over all possible k and (m1, m2) pairs of this minimum.

So the recurrence is:

DP[i][j][m] = max over k, m1, m2 of min(DP[i][k][m1], DP[k][j][m2])

where m1 + m2 + 1 = m.

The base case is when m=0: DP[i][j][0] = area of polygon i..j.

The answer would be DP[0][n-1][k], assuming that the original polygon is 0..n-1.

But how to compute the area of polygon i..j. Wait, for a convex polygon, the sequence i, i+1, ..., j must form a convex polygon. So the area can be computed using the shoelace formula for the polygon defined by these vertices.

So, first, we need to precompute the area for all possible sub-polygons i..j. For each i and j (where j > i), compute the area. Then, the DP can be built based on that.

The key steps are:

1. Precompute area[i][j] for all i < j.

2. Fill the DP[i][j][0] with area[i][j].

3. For m from 1 to k, compute DP[i][j][m] for all i < j.

But for this to work, the indices i and j must be ordered. Since the polygon is convex and given in anticlockwise order, the sub-polygons are also convex. So, the order of i and j is important. For example, the sub-polygon i..j (i < j) is the vertices from i to j in the original order. If j < i, then the sub-polygon would wrap around, but in the problem statement, n can be up to 200, so perhaps it's better to represent the polygon as a circular array, but during processing, the i and j are considered modulo n. But handling that could complicate things. However, given that the polygon is given in anticlockwise order, and the cuts are non-crossing, the sub-polygons will be consecutive sequences of the original vertices.

Wait, no. For example, the original polygon has vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose we split between 0 and 3. The sub-polygons would be 0,1,2,3 and 3,4,0. So the second sub-polygon wraps around. But when handling this in code, perhaps it's easier to represent the sub-polygons as sequences from i to j, where j can be larger than n. For example, if the original polygon has indices 0..4 (n=5), then the sub-polygon from 3 to 0 would be 3,4,0, but to represent this as i=3, j=5 (since 0 is the 5th index in a zero-based array of 5 elements). Wait, no. Wait, the original indices are 0 to n-1. So when j exceeds n-1, it's actually wrapping around. But perhaps it's easier to treat the polygon as a circular array, and for any i and j, the sub-polygon is the sequence starting at i, then i+1, ..., j-1, j. But if j < i, then it wraps around. But in that case, the area calculation would need to account for this.

But perhaps the easiest way is to precompute for all possible i and j (0 <= i, j < n) the area of the polygon formed by the vertices in order from i, next in the original order, up to j. For example, when i <= j, it's the vertices i, i+1, ..., j. When j < i, it's i, i+1, ..., n-1, 0, 1, ..., j. But this complicates the calculation of the area. Alternatively, since the polygon is convex, any consecutive sequence of vertices forms a convex polygon, and we can compute the area using the shoelace formula for that sequence.

But in code, how to handle the indices. Let's see. For example, if the original polygon is 0,1,2,3,4 (n=5), then the sub-polygon from 3 to 0 would be 3,4,0. So the sequence is 3,4,0. To compute the area, we can use the shoelace formula for this sequence.

So, the plan is:

- For each possible i and j, compute the sequence of vertices in the original order that form the sub-polygon from i to j. But how to generate this sequence.

Wait, perhaps the sub-polygon from i to j (i < j) is vertices i, i+1, ..., j. If j < i, then it's i, i+1, ..., n-1, 0, 1, ..., j. So the sequence is generated as (i, i+1 mod n, ..., j). But how to represent this in code. For example, for i=3, j=0, n=5: 3,4,0.

So the code for generating the vertices of the sub-polygon from i to j (in order) would be:

current = i
vertices = []
while current != j:
    vertices.append(current)
    current = (current + 1) % n
vertices.append(j)

But for a convex polygon, this sequence is a convex polygon.

Once the sequence is known, the area can be computed using the shoelace formula. But for each i and j, the area can be precomputed and stored in a 2D array. But since there are O(n^2) possible i and j pairs, and each pair's area computation is O(n) (since the sequence can be up to n elements), this would take O(n^3) time. For n=200, that's 8,000,000 operations, which is manageable in Python.

But wait, the problem is that for each i and j, the sequence of vertices can be of length up to n. So for 200^2 pairs, each requiring O(n) steps, it's 200^3 = 8,000,000 operations, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the area for the polygon from i to j. Since the original polygon is convex, the area from i to j can be computed as the area of the original polygon minus the sum of the areas of the other parts. But that's not straightforward. Alternatively, the area can be computed using the shoelace formula for the vertices in order.

So, first step: Precompute the area for all possible sub-polygons.

But for code, here's how to compute the area between i and j (inclusive):

Compute the list of vertices in order from i to j, moving clockwise (but since the original polygon is anticlockwise, the sequence i, i+1, ..., j is anticlockwise as well). So, for example, i=3, j=0 in n=5: the sequence is 3,4,0.

The shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices (x_0, y_0), ..., (x_{m-1}, y_{m-1}) is 0.5 * |sum_{k=0 to m-1} (x_k y_{k+1} - x_{k+1} y_k)|, where x_m = x_0, y_m = y_0.

But since the problem requires the area multiplied by 2, we can compute sum_{k=0 to m-1} (x_k y_{k+1} - x_{k+1} y_k), and the absolute value of that sum is twice the area. So the output is the sum, which is an integer (as per the input examples, where the outputs are integers). So, the area multiplied by 2 is the absolute value of the sum.

So, for each sub-polygon from i to j, the code can compute the sum S = sum of (x_p y_q - x_q y_p) for consecutive vertices p, q in the sequence, plus (x_j y_i - x_i y_j) to complete the loop. Then, the area multiplied by 2 is the absolute value of S.

Wait, let's think. The sequence of vertices for the sub-polygon is v_i, v_{i+1}, ..., v_j. But when we compute the shoelace sum for this polygon, we need to loop through the vertices in order and compute the sum of x_k * y_{k+1} - x_{k+1} * y_k for each consecutive pair, including the pair (last vertex, first vertex).

So, for the sequence [i, i+1, ..., j], the sum is:

sum_{k=i to j-1} (x_k x_{k+1} part) + (x_j x_i part - ... )

Wait, no. For example, for vertices a, b, c, the shoelace sum is (a.x*b.y - a.y*b.x) + (b.x*c.y - b.y*c.x) + (c.x*a.y - c.y*a.x).

So for a sequence of vertices [v0, v1, v2, ..., vk], the sum is (v0.x*v1.y - v0.y*v1.x) + (v1.x*v2.y - v1.y*v2.x) + ... + (vk.x*v0.y - vk.y*v0.x).

So, for the sub-polygon from i to j, the code can generate the list of vertices in order, then compute the sum.

But generating the list for every i and j is O(n^3) time. For n=200, 200^3 is 8 million, which is acceptable in Python.

So the steps are:

1. Read the input and store the vertices as a list of (x, y) pairs.

2. Precompute a 2D array area[i][j], which is twice the area of the sub-polygon from i to j. For each i and j, compute the sum as described.

3. For the DP, the base case is when m=0: DP[i][j][0] = area[i][j].

4. For m >=1, compute DP[i][j][m] as the maximum over all possible splits k and allocations of m-1 cuts into m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 +1 = m. The value for each split is the minimum of DP[i][k][m1] and DP[k][j][m2]. We take the maximum of all these minima.

But the problem is that the DP table would need to be filled in a certain order. The order should process m in increasing order, and for each m, process the sub-polygons in increasing order of length.

The main challenge is implementing this DP efficiently. But how?

An alternative approach is to use memoization. However, in Python, for n=200 and m=200, a memoization approach might be too slow.

Alternatively, we can precompute the DP table for all possible i, j, and m using dynamic programming. For this, we can iterate over the lengths of the sub-polygons. For each possible sub-polygon length l (number of vertices), process all possible i and j such that the sub-polygon from i to j has l vertices. For each such i and j, compute DP[i][j][m] for all possible m.

Wait, but the number of vertices in the sub-polygon from i to j is (j - i + 1) mod n. For example, if i=3 and j=0 (n=5), then the number of vertices is 3 (3,4,0). So the length is 3. So for a sub-polygon of length l, we can process them in increasing order of l. For each l from 2 up to n (since a polygon requires at least 3 vertices?), wait, no. Wait, a polygon must have at least 3 vertices. So for the DP to be applicable, the sub-polygon must have at least 3 vertices. Wait, but when you split a polygon into two parts, one of them could be a triangle (3 vertices), and the other could have more.

But in the problem statement, the cuts are between two different non-adjacent vertices. So the split between i and k must form a diagonal. So the sub-polygons after splitting must each have at least 3 vertices. Wait, no. Suppose the original polygon is a quadrilateral (4 vertices). Split between i=0 and k=2. Then the two sub-polygons are 0,1,2 (triangle) and 2,3,0 (triangle). So in that case, each sub-polygon has 3 vertices.

So, for a sub-polygon to be split, it must have at least 4 vertices (since the split requires two non-adjacent vertices). So when the sub-polygon has l vertices, the number of possible splits is l-3 (since for each split, the k must be between i+1 and j-1, non-adjacent). For example, in a polygon with l vertices, there are (l-3) possible splits (since the split must be between vertices that are not adjacent and not the same as i or j).

So for the DP, when processing a sub-polygon of length l, we can split it into two sub-polygons of lengths l1 and l2, where l1 + l2 = l + 1 (since adding the diagonal between i and k creates two sub-polygons, each containing the split points). Wait, perhaps not. For example, if the original polygon is 0-1-2-3-4 (5 vertices), and split between 0 and 3, then the left sub-polygon is 0-1-2-3 (4 vertices) and the right is 3-4-0 (3 vertices). The left has 4 vertices (0,1,2,3), right has 3 (3,4,0). So the sum of their lengths is 4 +3 =7, which is the original length (5) plus 2.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the lengths of the two sub-polygons is the original length plus 2. Because splitting a polygon with l vertices into two parts via a diagonal creates two polygons with (k - i + 1) and (j -k + 1) vertices. For example, in the original example, splitting 0-1-2-3-4 (5 vertices) between 0 and 3, the left has 4 vertices (0,1,2,3), the right has 3 (3,4,0). So 4 +3 =7 =5 +2.

So the sum of the lengths of the two sub-polygons is l +2. So for a sub-polygon of length l, the split into two parts will have lengths l1 and l2, with l1 + l2 = l + 2. So for the DP, the sub-polygons to process should be ordered in increasing order of their length. Because when splitting a sub-polygon of length l, the two resulting sub-polygons have lengths l1 and l2 which are both smaller than l (since l1 >=3 and l2 >=3, and l >=4). Wait, no. For example, splitting a 5-vertex polygon into 4 and 3. Then 4 is larger than 3, but 4 is still larger than the original 5-vertex? No. Wait, the original is 5, and the split into 4 and3, which sum to 7. So the original length is 5, but the two sub-polygons have lengths 4 and3, which are both less than 5? No, 4 is less than 5. So when processing polygons in order of increasing length, the splits would have been processed for smaller lengths first.

So the order for filling the DP table should be:

For all possible sub-polygon lengths l in increasing order (starting from 3 up to n), process all i, j such that the sub-polygon i..j has length l.

For each such i, j, and m, compute DP[i][j][m] by considering all possible splits k and allocations of m-1 cuts between the two sub-polygons.

But this approach would require O(n^3 * k) time, which for n=200 and k=200 is 200^3 * 200 = 1.6e9 operations. That's way too much for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.

So this approach is not feasible. Hence, we need a different way.

Alternative idea: Since the problem requires that the cuts form non-crossing diagonals, the optimal solution for k cuts is to split the polygon into k+1 regions, each of which is a convex polygon, and the minimal area is the maximum possible. To maximize the minimal area, perhaps the optimal split is to split the polygon into regions with equal areas, but that's not always possible. However, the problem requires that the minimal area is as large as possible.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem as a partition into k+1 regions. The minimal area among these regions must be as large as possible. The optimal way is to have all regions as equal as possible. So, perhaps the solution is to split the polygon into k+1 regions with as equal areas as possible.

But how to model this.

Another approach is to model this problem as a binary search on the possible minimal area. For a given candidate area A, can we split the polygon into k+1 regions, each with area >= A, using k non-crossing cuts?

If this is possible, then we can try to find the maximum A for which this is true.

But how to check if such a split exists. This seems challenging, but perhaps it can be done with a greedy approach or dynamic programming.

But how to compute the maximum possible A.

Alternatively, for the DP approach, perhaps we can optimize the state transitions. For example, for each DP[i][j][m], the possible splits k can be limited to those that are "balanced" in terms of the area. Or, perhaps memoization can be optimized by precomputing possible splits and pruning impossible ones.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the DP approach is manageable for n=200 and k up to 197. Let's try to proceed.

Let's outline the steps again:

1. Precompute the area for all sub-polygons i..j.

   For each i and j (0 <= i, j < n), compute the area[i][j] as twice the area of the sub-polygon from i to j.

   How to compute this:

   For each i from 0 to n-1:

      For j from i+2 to i + n -1:

         The sub-polygon consists of the vertices from i to j mod n.

         Generate the list of vertices in order.

         Compute the sum S using the shoelace formula.

         area[i][j mod n] = abs(S)

   Wait, but for j > i, the sub-polygon is i, i+1, ..., j.

   For j < i, the sub-polygon wraps around. For example, j = i-1 mod n would be invalid because it's adjacent. Wait, but for a polygon, the sub-polygon must have at least 3 vertices. So, the minimum length is 3.

   So, for the area[i][j] to be valid, the sub-polygon must have at least 3 vertices. So j must be >= i+2 (mod n).

But how to handle that. Maybe for i and j, if the number of vertices between i and j (inclusive) is at least 3.

But perhaps it's easier to precompute for all i and j (i != j), but when the sub-polygon has less than 3 vertices, the area is zero. But in the DP, those cases would not be considered.

But in the problem statement, the cuts are between non-adjacent vertices, so the split would generate sub-polygons with at least 3 vertices.

So during the DP processing, when splitting i..j into i..k and k..j, the sub-polygons i..k and k..j must each have at least 3 vertices. So, the split k must be such that i..k has at least 3 vertices and k..j has at least 3 vertices.

So, for a sub-polygon i..j (which has l vertices), the possible split k must be such that the sub-polygon i..k has at least 3 vertices and k..j has at least 3 vertices. So, for i..j to be split, l must be at least 4, and k must be at least i+2 and j-2 (mod n), but in the case of the original polygon being linear (i < j), k must be between i+2 and j-2.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the sub-polygon is i, i+1, i+2, i+3 (4 vertices). The possible split k is i+2. Because splitting between i and k =i+2 creates two sub-polygons: i, i+1, i+2 (3 vertices) and i+2, i+3, i (3 vertices). But wait, the split is between i and k = i+2. So the two sub-polygons are i..k (i, i+1, i+2) and k..j (i+2, i+3, ..., j). Wait, but j is i+3 in this case. So the second sub-polygon is i+2, i+3 (which is j), and then back to i? No, wait, the original sub-polygon is i, i+1, i+2, i+3. Splitting between i and i+2 gives two sub-polygons: i, i+1, i+2 (3 vertices) and i+2, i+3, i (3 vertices).

So, in code, for a given i and j (original linear indices), the split k must be such that the number of vertices in i..k is at least 3, and k..j has at least 3 vertices. So for a sub-polygon of length l, the split k must be at least i+2 and j-2, but this depends on the indices.

But perhaps in the code, for each split k in i+1 < k < j-1 (assuming i < j). But this depends on the way the indices are represented.

Alternatively, for a sub-polygon i..j (assuming i < j), the split can be made at k, where i+1 < k < j-1. Because adjacent vertices are not allowed (cuts are between non-adjacent vertices). So the possible k's are between i+2 and j-2.

But this is for the case when i < j. For the case when j < i (wrapping around), it's more complex.

This suggests that handling the splits in code would be complicated. Maybe there's a better way to represent the indices.

Alternative approach: Represent the sub-polygon as a start index and length. For example, for a start index i and length l (number of vertices), the sub-polygon is formed by i, i+1, ..., i + l -1 mod n. This way, for each possible start i and length l, we can precompute the area.

But this still leaves the problem of finding the split points k. For a sub-polygon of length l, the split must be made between i and i + t mod n, where t is between 2 and l-2 (so that each sub-polygon has at least 3 vertices). For example, if l=4 (vertices i, i+1, i+2, i+3), then the split can be made at i+2 (t=2), resulting in two sub-polygons of length 3 and 3.

So, for a sub-polygon of length l, the split can be made after t+1 vertices, where t ranges from 2 to l-2. So, t+1 is the number of vertices in the left sub-polygon. The left has t+1 vertices (i, i+1, ..., i+t), and the right has l - (t+1) + 2 vertices (since splitting adds the split vertex to both sub-polygons). Wait, no. For example, the original polygon has length l. Split at t+1 vertices, the left has t+1 vertices, and the right has l - (t+1) + 2 vertices (because the split vertex is included in both). Wait, perhaps the right has l - t+1 vertices.

But perhaps this approach complicates the code further.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the DP approach is the way to go, and optimizing the code to handle the circular indices as efficiently as possible.

Now, the code outline:

Read n and k.

Read the vertices' coordinates.

Precompute area[i][j] for all possible i and j.

For each i from 0 to n-1:

   for j in range(i+2, i + n):

       current_j = j % n

       if current_j == (i+1) % n:

           continue  # adjacent, not allowed

       vertices = []

       current = i

       while current != current_j:

           vertices.append((x[current], y[current]))

           current = (current + 1) % n

       vertices.append((x[current_j], y[current_j]))

       # compute the shoelace sum

       sum_area = 0

       m = len(vertices)

       for p in range(m):

           q = (p + 1) % m

           sum_area += vertices[p][0] * vertices[q][1] - vertices[p][1] * vertices[q][0]

       area[i][current_j] = abs(sum_area)

But this code would have O(n^3) time, which is feasible for n=200. But in Python, this may be a bit slow.

Alternative idea: precompute for each i and j the sum of the x and y products along the path from i to j. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, precompute the prefix sums for the shoelace formula. The original polygon's vertices are v_0, v_1, ..., v_{n-1}. The total area of the polygon is computed as the sum from i=0 to n-1 of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i), where v_n = v_0. The sum is stored as a prefix sum array.

But for a sub-polygon i..j, the sum would need to be the sum of the terms from i to j-1, plus the term j to i. So perhaps the prefix sums can help here.

Let's compute the standard prefix sums for the original polygon. For example, S[i] is the sum of terms from v_0 to v_{i-1} (v_i's term). Then, the sum from i to j (i < j) would be S[j] - S[i], plus the term (v_j.x * v_i.y - v_i.x * v_j.y) to complete the loop. So for the sub-polygon i..j (i < j), the sum would be (S[j] - S[i]) + (v_j.x * v_i.y - v_i.x * v_j.y).

But for i > j, it's more complex. For example, the sub-polygon from i to j (j < i) is i, i+1, ..., n-1, 0, 1, ..., j. So the sum would be (S[n] - S[i]) + (S[j] - S[0]) + (v_j.x * v_i.y - v_i.x * v_j.y).

But this is getting complicated. However, this approach would allow computing the area for any i and j in O(1) time after precomputing the prefix sums.

Let's try this.

Compute the standard prefix sums for the original polygon. Let S[0] = 0, S[1] = x_0 y_1 - x_1 y_0, S[2] = S[1] + x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1, and so on up to S[n], which is the sum of all terms from 0 to n-1.

Then, for the original polygon's area, the sum is S[n] (but with absolute value and divided by 2).

For a sub-polygon from i to j (i < j), the sum is S[j] - S[i] (sum from i to j-1) plus (x_j y_i - x_i y_j) (the term from j to i). So the total sum for the sub-polygon is (S[j] - S[i]) + (x_j y_i - x_i y_j).

For a sub-polygon from i to j where j < i, it's the sum from i to n-1 plus the sum from 0 to j-1 plus (x_j y_i - x_i y_j). So the sum is (S[n] - S[i]) + (S[j] - S[0]) + (x_j y_i - x_i y_j).

But since S[0] is zero, and S[n] is the sum for the original polygon, this becomes S[n] - S[i] + S[j] + (x_j y_i - x_i y_j).

So, the area[i][j] can be computed using the prefix sums as follows:

if i < j:

    sum_ = (S[j] - S[i]) + (x[j] * y[i] - x[i] * y[j])

else:

    sum_ = (S[n] - S[i]) + (S[j] - S[0]) + (x[j] * y[i] - x[i] * y[j])

sum_ = abs(sum_)

This way, the area[i][j] can be computed in O(1) time for any i and j after precomputing the prefix sums.

This is a huge optimization, reducing the precomputation time from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

So steps to precompute area[i][j]:

1. Compute the prefix sums S[0..n], where S[k] is the sum of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) for i from 0 to k-1.

2. For each i and j:

   if i == j: area[i][j] = 0 (invalid, not a polygon)

   else:

      if i < j:

          sum_ = (S[j] - S[i]) + (x[j] * y[i] - x[i] * y[j])

      else:

          sum_ = (S[n] - S[i]) + (S[j] - S[0]) + (x[j] * y[i] - x[i] * y[j])

      area[i][j] = abs(sum_)

But wait, for j = i+1, the sub-polygon is just two vertices, which is invalid. But since the cuts are between non-adjacent vertices, the splits will generate sub-polygons with at least 3 vertices. So during the DP processing, any splits that generate such invalid sub-polygons are not considered.

But during the precomputation, the area[i][j] for j = i+1 is computed, but it's invalid. However, in the DP, those cases are not considered.

Now, with this precomputation, the area can be computed in O(1) per i and j.

Next, the DP.

The DP[i][j][m] represents the maximum possible minimal area when splitting the sub-polygon i..j with m cuts (resulting in m+1 regions). The DP is stored as a 3-dimensional array, but given the memory constraints (256MB), we need to be careful with space.

For n=200, the number of i and j pairs is 200*200=40,000. For m up to 200, the total memory required is 40,000 * 200 * 4 bytes (assuming 4 bytes per integer) is about 32 million bytes (32MB), which is manageable.

But in Python, using a 3D list would be memory-intensive. Instead, we can use a dictionary or optimize using 2D arrays for each m.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a memoization dictionary, but given Python's speed, it's better to precompute the DP tables.

But the problem is that for each i, j, and m, the DP[i][j][m] is stored.

So, the code would have a 3D array, such as dp[i][j][m] = value.

But in Python, this can be represented as a list of lists of lists. For n=200 and m=200, the size would be 200 * 200 * 200 = 8,000,000 entries. But each entry is an integer. In Python, integers take up more space, but with 8 million entries, it's manageable.

Alternatively, we can use a 2D array for each m, and process them in increasing order of m.

But how to proceed.

The base case is when m=0: dp[i][j][0] = area[i][j].

For m >=1, dp[i][j][m] is the maximum over all possible splits k and splits of m-1 cuts into m1 and m2 (m1 + m2 = m-1) of the minimum of dp[i][k][m1] and dp[k][j][m2].

So, the code structure would be:

Initialize a 3D array dp[i][j][m] for all i, j, m.

For m in 0 to k:

    for each sub-polygon i..j:

        if m ==0:

            dp[i][j][m] = area[i][j]

        else:

            max_val = 0

            for k in possible splits between i and j:

                for m1 in 0 to m-1:

                    m2 = m-1 - m1

                    val = min(dp[i][k][m1], dp[k][j][m2])

                    if val > max_val:

                        max_val = val

            dp[i][j][m] = max_val

The problem is to find all possible splits k and possible m1 and m2.

But how to find the possible splits k for a given i and j.

A split k is valid if the sub-polygons i..k and k..j each have at least 3 vertices.

So, for a sub-polygon i..j (in the circular sense), the possible k's are those where the number of vertices in i..k is at least 3, and the number of vertices in k..j is at least 3.

But how to compute this.

In terms of the indices, for i and j:

If the sub-polygon i..j has l vertices, then the split k must be such that the left sub-polygon has at least 3 vertices, and the right sub-polygon has at least 3 vertices.

But since the polygon is convex, the split can be made between i and any non-adjacent vertex k.

Alternatively, for a valid split between i and k, the sub-polygons must have at least 3 vertices each.

So, for a sub-polygon i..j (of length l), the split k must be at least two steps away from i and at least two steps away from j.

So, in code, for a given i and j, the valid k's are those where (k is not adjacent to i) and (k is not adjacent to j), and the split between i and k is a valid diagonal.

But how to generate these k's.

Alternatively, for each possible split k, we can check if the sub-polygon i..k has at least 3 vertices and k..j has at least 3 vertices.

The number of vertices in i..k is (k -i) mod n.

But this is not correct. For example, if i=3, j=0 (n=5), then the sub-polygon i..j is 3,4,0. If k=4, then i..k is 3,4 (length 2), which is invalid. So, in this case, k=4 is not a valid split.

So, the code needs to check for each possible k whether the sub-polygons i..k and k..j each have at least 3 vertices.

But how to compute that.

For a split k:

The number of vertices in i..k is (k -i) mod n. If this is >=2 (since the split is between i and k, which are non-adjacent), then i..k has at least 3 vertices (i, i+1, ..., k).

Wait, no. For example, i=0, k=2 (n=5). The sub-polygon is 0,1,2 (3 vertices). So (k -i) mod n is 2, which is 2. So if (k -i) mod n >= 2, then the sub-polygon i..k has at least 3 vertices.

Similarly, for the other sub-polygon k..j: (j -k) mod n must be >=2.

So, in code:

for each possible k in 0..n-1:

    if k == i or k == j:

        continue  # invalid split

    len1 = (k - i) % n

    len2 = (j -k) % n

    if len1 >=2 and len2 >=2:

        # valid split

        process this k

But how to iterate over all possible k's for given i and j.

In Python, for given i and j, we can loop through all possible k from 0 to n-1, and check the lengths.

But this is O(n) per split, which for n=200 and O(n^2) i,j pairs and m=200, leads to O(n^3 * m) time, which is 200^3 * 200 = 1.6e9 operations. This is not feasible in Python.

Alternative idea: precompute for all i and j, the list of valid k's.

For each i and j:

    valid_ks = []

    for k in 0 to n-1:

        if k == i or k == j:

            continue

        len1 = (k -i) % n

        len2 = (j -k) % n

        if len1 >=2 and len2 >=2:

            valid_ks.append(k)

    store valid_ks for (i,j)

But precomputing this for all i and j would take O(n^3) time, which is 200^3 = 8e6 operations, which is manageable.

But even this may not be feasible in Python for time. However, given the time limit of 3 seconds, perhaps this can be done.

Once the valid_ks are precomputed, for each split, the code can iterate through the valid_ks list.

But even with this optimization, for each (i,j,m), the code would need to iterate over all valid_ks, and for each k, iterate over m1 in 0..m-1.

This is still O(n^3 * m^2), which is 200^3 * 200^2 = 3.2e9 operations. That's way too slow.

Alternative Idea: Observe that for the DP transition, when splitting into m1 and m2, the minimal area is min(dp[i][k][m1], dp[k][j][m2]). To maximize this, for each possible split k and m, we need to find the best allocation of m1 and m2 (summing to m-1) such that the minimum of the two is as large as possible.

This is equivalent to finding for each split k, the maximum over m1 of min(dp[i][k][m1], dp[k][j][m-1 -m1}).

But finding this maximum is expensive.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize this. For each split k, the best allocation of m1 and m2 can be found using a two-pointer approach.

For example, for a given k and m, as m1 increases, m2 decreases. The value of dp[i][k][m1] increases with m1 (since more cuts allow higher minimal areas), and dp[k][j][m2] increases with m2. So the function min(a[m1], b[m2]) may have a maximum at some point where a[m1] and b[m2] are balanced.

Thus, for each split k, we can iterate m1 from 0 to m-1, and track the maximum of min(a[m1], b[m-1 -m1}).

But this is O(m) per split k, which for m=200 is manageable if the number of splits per (i,j) is not too large.

But with n=200 and m=200, this is still 200 * 200 * 200 * 200 = 1.6e9 operations. That's way too much.

Alternative Idea: Notice that for a given k, the optimal m1 is such that dp[i][k][m1] >= dp[k][j][m-1 -m1} and dp[i][k][m1-1} < dp[k][j][m-1 -m1} +1}. This could be found using binary search.

But this requires that dp[i][k][m1] is monotonic in m1. Which is the case because as m1 increases, you are allowed more cuts, which allows the sub-polygon i..k to be split into more regions, thus the minimal area can only increase or stay the same. So, dp[i][k][m1] is non-decreasing with m1.

Proof: Adding more cuts can only increase or maintain the minimal area. For example, if you have m1+1 cuts, you can split the sub-polygon into m1+2 regions. The minimal area of these regions can be no smaller than when you have m1 cuts (since you can always choose not to use the extra cut and leave the regions as they were).

Thus, dp[i][k][m1] is non-decreasing as m1 increases.

Similarly, dp[k][j][m2] is non-decreasing as m2 increases.

Thus, for a given split k and total cuts m, the maximum of min(a[m1], b[m2]) where m1 + m2 = m-1 is achieved when a[m1] and b[m2] are as close as possible.

Because a increases with m1 and b increases with m2 (since m2 = m-1 -m1), the maximum min is achieved at the point where a[m1] and b[m-1 -m1} are as close as possible.

This is similar to the classic two-sum problem where we try to find two values in two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to a target. But here, we're looking for m1 such that min(a[m1], b[m2]) is maximized.

Given that both a and b are non-decreasing, the optimal m1 can be found by checking when a[m1] is just equal to or greater than b[m2], which is m-1 -m1.

The optimal point is when a[m1] is as close as possible to b[m2].

Thus, for each split k, the optimal m1 can be found using a two-pointer approach. For example, start with m1 = 0 and m2 = m-1, and increment m1 until a[m1] > b[m2], then track the maximum min.

But since a and b are sorted, we can binary search for the optimal m1.

This reduces the time per split k from O(m) to O(log m), which is a significant improvement.

So, for each split k, the code can perform a binary search to find the best m1 in the range [0, m-1].

Here's how:

Initialize the maximum value as 0.

For split k:

   low = 0

   high = m-1

   best = 0

   for m1 in 0 to m-1:

       m2 = (m-1) - m1

       current = min(dp[i][k][m1], dp[k][j][m2])

       if current > best:

           best = current

   max_val = max(max_val, best)

But this is O(m) per split. However, since a and b are non-decreasing, the optimal m1 can be found in O(1) steps.

Wait, think about the functions:

m1 ranges from 0 to m-1.

a[m1] is non-decreasing.

b[m2] = b[ (m-1) - m1 ] is non-increasing (since m2 = m-1 - m1, which decreases as m1 increases).

Thus, the function min(a[m1], b[m2]) first increases, reaches a maximum, then decreases. So the maximum is achieved at the point where a[m1] and b[m2] cross.

Thus, the optimal m1 is the largest possible where a[m1] <= b[m2], and the next m1 is where a[m1] > b[m2]. The maximum is either at this m1 or m1+1.

So, we can binary search for the first m1 where a[m1] > b[m2], and check around that point.

Alternatively, since a and b are sorted, we can find the m1 where a[m1] is approximately equal to b[m-1 -m1], and evaluate a few points around it.

Here's a possible approach:

Initialize left = 0, right = m-1.

while left <= right:

   mid = (left + right) // 2

   m2 = (m-1) - mid

   if a[mid] < b[m2]:

       left = mid + 1

   else:

       right = mid -1

The optimal m1 is around left or right.

Then, check the candidates mid-1, mid, mid+1, etc. to find the maximum.

But even this may not be necessary, as the maximum is at the point where a and b cross.

So, after finding the possible candidates, the code can compute the maximum among them.

This approach reduces the time per split k from O(m) to O(1) steps, which is crucial for the code to run within time.

But implementing this correctly is crucial.

Let's outline the steps for a given split k:

The optimal m1 is where a[m1] is as close as possible to b[m2], and the maximum of the min is achieved.

Thus, for split k:

max_candidate = 0

m1 = 0

m2 = m-1 - m1

current = min(a[m1], b[m2])

max_candidate = current

m1 = m-1

m2 = m-1 - m1 = 0

current = min(a[m1], b[m2])

if current > max_candidate:

    max_candidate = current

mid = (m-1) // 2

for m1 in [mid-1, mid, mid+1]:

    if m1 <0 or m1 > m-1:

        continue

    m2 = m-1 -m1

    current = min(a[m1], b[m2])

    if current > max_candidate:

        max_candidate = current

Thus, by checking a few points (left, right, mid), we can find the maximum candidate.

But this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases. Alternatively, since the function is first increasing and then decreasing, the maximum is either at the crossover point or at the ends.

But in code, to handle all cases, perhaps the best approach is to iterate m1 from 0 to m-1, but given the time constraints, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each split k and m, the maximum min(a[m1], b[m2]) is the maximum between all possible pairs. But given that a and b are non-decreasing, the maximum is achieved at the point where a[m1] is just equal to or greater than b[m2]. So for each split k:

   m2 = m-1 - m1

   The maximum of min(a[m1], b[m2]) is either when a[m1] is as large as possible without exceeding b[m2], or when b[m2] is as large as possible without exceeding a[m1].

   So, the optimal point is where a[m1] and b[m2] are as close as possible.

Thus, the code can perform a binary search to find the m1 where a[m1] >= b[m2], and then check the nearby m1 values.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can just iterate over all m1 values from 0 to m-1, but this is O(m) per split k.

But for n=200, m=200, and per (i,j) pair up to 200 splits k, this is 200 * 200 * 200 * 200 = 1.6e9 operations. Which is way too slow.

Thus, the DP approach is not feasible for the given constraints.

Alternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of splitting the polygon into k+1 regions. The optimal way to maximize the minimal area is to split the polygon into regions with as equal areas as possible. So, the solution is to find the largest possible A such that the polygon can be split into k+1 regions, each with area >=A.

This suggests a binary search approach.

But how to check if it's possible to split the polygon into k+1 regions with each area >=A.

The checking function would need to determine whether there exists a way to split the polygon into k+1 regions, each with area >=A, using k non-crossing cuts.

But how to implement this check.

This seems challenging, but perhaps a greedy approach could work. For example, greedily split the polygon into regions of at least area A, and see if the number of regions is >=k+1.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, dynamic programming can be used with the binary search.

For a given A, compute the maximum number of regions that can be formed with each region's area >=A. If this maximum is >=k+1, then A is possible.

But how to compute the maximum number of regions.

This seems like a promising approach. The idea is to use binary search on A, and for each candidate A, compute the maximum number of regions that can be formed such that each region has area >=A. If this maximum is >=k+1, then A is feasible.

The key is to compute, for a given A, the maximum number of regions (cuts) possible.

The DP for this would have state (i, j) representing a sub-polygon, and the value would be the maximum number of regions (cuts) possible for that sub-polygon with each region's area >=A.

The recurrence would be:

For each possible split k, split the sub-polygon into two regions. The area of each region must be >=A. Then, the maximum number of regions for (i,j) is 1 + max_cuts(i,k) + max_cuts(k,j).

But this is not correct, because each split counts as one cut, and the total number of regions is 1 + cuts. So, the maximum number of regions is 1 + (cuts1 + cuts2), where cuts1 and cuts2 are the cuts for the two sub-regions.

But the DP would track the maximum number of regions possible for each sub-polygon, given that each region has area >=A.

So, the DP[i][j] represents the maximum number of regions that the sub-polygon i..j can be split into, with each region's area >=A. If the entire area of the sub-polygon is <A, then it's impossible, and DP[i][j] = 0.

The recurrence is:

If area[i][j] <A: DP[i][j] =0.

Else:

DP[i][j] = 1 (the entire sub-polygon is one region).

For each possible split k:

   if area[i][k] >=A and area[k][j] >=A:

       current_regions = DP[i][k] + DP[k][j]

       if current_regions > current_max:

           current_max = current_regions

DP[i][j] = max(1, current_max)

The answer is whether DP[0][n-1] >=k+1.

This approach allows us to use binary search on A.

The binary search would proceed between 0 and the total area of the polygon divided by (k+1) (since each region must be at least A, and there are k+1 regions, the maximum possible A is (total_area) / (k+1)).

For each mid A, we compute the maximum number of regions possible. If it's >=k+1, then we can try a larger A. Else, we need to try a smaller A.

But how to compute the DP efficiently for each A.

The DP for each A would take O(n^3) time, which for binary search of 40 steps (log2(1e16)) would be 40 * 2e6 = 8e7 operations, which is manageable.

So, this approach is feasible.

But how to compute the DP for each A.

The steps are:

1. Precompute the area array.

2. Precompute the total area of the polygon.

3. Binary search A between 0 and total_area/(k+1).

4. For each mid A, compute the DP[i][j] for all sub-polygons i..j.

   a. For each sub-polygon i..j, sorted by increasing length.

   b. For each i..j:

      i. If the area is <A, DP[i][j] =0.

      ii. Else:

          initialize DP[i][j] =1.

          for all possible splits k:

              if the area of i..k >=A and area of k..j >=A:

                  DP[i][j] = max(DP[i][j], DP[i][k] + DP[k][j])

5. If DP[0][n-1] >=k+1, then A is possible. Search for higher A.

Else, search for lower A.

Finally, the largest possible A is the answer.

This approach reduces the problem to a binary search combined with a dynamic programming check for each candidate A.

The key advantage is that the DP for each A can be computed in O(n^3) time, which for n=200 is 200^3=8e6 operations per binary search step. With 40 steps, this totals 3.2e8 operations, which is manageable in Python.

Thus, this seems like a feasible approach.

Now, let's outline the code for this approach.

First, precompute the area array as described.

Then, compute the total area of the polygon.

Then, binary search between low=0 and high= total_area.

For each mid value, compute the maximum number of regions possible.

If it's >=k+1, then set low=mid. Else, set high=mid.

Once the binary search is complete, the low value will be the maximum possible A.

Then, output low multiplied by 2 (since the problem requires to output twice the area).

Wait, no. Because the area array already stores twice the area. So the binary search should be based on the stored area values (which are twice the actual area).

So the total_area is the sum computed by the shoelace formula, which is twice the actual area.

So, the binary search should be on the stored area values. For example, the maximum possible A is (total_area) // (k+1).

So, the code steps:

Read n and k.

Read the vertices.

Precompute the area array, where area[i][j] is twice the area of the sub-polygon i..j.

Compute the total_area = area[0][n-1].

If k ==0:

   output area[0][n-1] // 2 * 2? No, wait, the output is the area multiplied by 2, but when k=0, there is one region, so the answer is area[0][n-1] (which is twice the area).

So output area[0][n-1].

Else:

   binary search between low=0 and high= total_area.

   while low < high:

       mid = (low + high +1) // 2

       compute max_regions = dp(mid)

       if max_regions >=k+1:

           low = mid

       else:

           high = mid -1

   output low.

But how to compute dp(mid) for a given A.

For the DP:

For each sub-polygon i..j, sorted by increasing length.

Initialize a 2D array dp_regions[i][j].

For each i..j:

   if area[i][j] < A:

       dp_regions[i][j] =0

   else:

       max_regions =1

       for all possible splits k:

           if area[i][k] >=A and area[k][j] >=A:

               regions = dp_regions[i][k] + dp_regions[k][j]

               if regions > max_regions:

                   max_regions = regions

       dp_regions[i][j] = max_regions

The maximum_regions is stored in dp_regions[0][n-1].

The problem is to compute this for each i, j in the correct order.

To compute the DP correctly, we need to process the sub-polygons in increasing order of length. Because when splitting i..j into i..k and k..j, the sub-polygons i..k and k..j must have been processed before i..j.

So, the code must process the sub-polygons in order of increasing length.

But how to determine the length of a sub-polygon i..j.

The length can be (j -i) mod n, but this is not correct for j <i. So, the actual length is the number of vertices in the sub-polygon, which is (j -i +n) % n +1.

For example, i=3, j=0, n=5: the length is (0-3+5) %5 +1= 2%5+1= 3.

So, the code can compute the length as ((j -i) %n) +1 if j >=i, else (j +n -i) %n +1.

But this can be simplified to ((j -i) %n) if j >=i else (j +n -i).

Wait, no. For i=3, j=0, n=5: the number of vertices is 3 (3,4,0). So, the length is 3, which is (0-3 +5) =2 +1=3.

So, the formula is length = (j -i +n) %n if j <i else j-i+1.

Wait, no. For i=0, j=2, n=5: the length is 3 (0,1,2), which is j-i+1=3.

For i=3, j=0: (0-3 +5) =2, plus 1? No, 3,4,0: 3 vertices. So (0-3 +5) =2, then plus1 would give 3.

So the formula for length is ((j -i +n) %n) +1 if j <i else j-i+1.

No, wait:

For i=3, j=0 in n=5:

(j -i +n) mod n = (0-3 +5) mod 5 = 2 mod5=2.

Adding 1 gives 3, which is correct.

For i=0, j=2: j-i+1=3.

For i=2, j=4: j-i+1=3.

So the formula is ((j -i +n) %n) +1.

But this can be simplified to ((j -i) %n) +1.

Because (j -i) can be negative, so (j -i +n) mod n is equivalent to (j -i) modn.

Thus, length = (j -i) %n +1.

Yes:

For i=3, j=0, (0-3) mod5 is 2, plus 1 is3.

For i=0, j=2, (2-0) mod5=2+1=3.

Yes.

So, the length of the sub-polygon i..j is (j -i) %n +1.

Thus, the code can process the sub-polygons in increasing order of length.

But for the DP, we need to process all possible i and j pairs, ordered by their length.

So, the code can generate a list of all i and j pairs, ordered by their length.

For each possible length l from 3 to n:

   for each possible i:

       j = (i + l -1) %n

       add (i,j) to the list.

But this would generate all possible sub-polygons of length l.

But this approach may generate some i,j pairs multiple times. For example, i=0 and j=2 (length 3), and i=1 and j=3 (length3). But each pair is processed once per their length.

Alternatively, the code can generate all possible i and j pairs, compute their length, and sort them by length.

But for n=200, the total number of pairs is 200*200=40,000. Sorting them by length is manageable.

Once sorted, the code can process the pairs in order of increasing length.

Thus, the code steps for the DP check:

For a given A:

   create a 2D array dp_regions[i][j] for all i and j.

   sorted_pairs = list of all i,j pairs, sorted by length in increasing order.

   for each (i,j) in sorted_pairs:

       if area[i][j] <A:

           dp_regions[i][j] =0

       else:

           max_regions =1

           # find all valid splits k

           for k in valid_ks[i][j]:

               if area[i][k] >=A and area[k][j] >=A:

                   regions = dp_regions[i][k] + dp_regions[k][j]

                   if regions > max_regions:

                       max_regions = regions

           dp_regions[i][j] = max_regions

   return dp_regions[0][n-1]

But the code needs to precompute the valid_ks for each i,j.

Precomputing valid_ks for each i,j:

valid_ks = [[[] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(n):

        if i ==j:

            continue

        valid_ks[i][j] = []

        for k in range(n):

            if k ==i or k ==j:

                continue

            len_ik = (k -i) %n +1

            len_kj = (j -k) %n +1

            if len_ik >=3 and len_kj >=3:

                valid_ks[i][j].append(k)

This precomputation is O(n^3), which for n=200 is 8e6 operations, manageable.

Thus, the code can precompute valid_ks once.

Putting it all together:

The code will:

- Precompute area and valid_ks.

- Binary search on A.

- For each A, compute the maximum number of regions.

- Output the maximum A where the regions >=k+1.

Now, let's test the code against the examples.

First example:

Input:

8 4

-2 -4

2 -2

4 2

1 5

0 5

-4 4

-5 0

-5 -1

The total area is area[0][7] = 11 + ... ? The output is 11, which is the minimal region's area multiplied by 2.

But according to the binary search approach, the code would find the maximum A such that the polygon can be split into 5 regions (k=4), each with area >=A. The maximum such A is 11.

So during binary search, when A=11, the maximum regions would be >=5.

The code should compute this correctly.

Similarly, the second example should return 3.

Thus, this approach seems correct.

Now, the code:

Read n and k.

Read the vertices.

Compute the prefix sums.

Precompute area[i][j].

Precompute valid_ks.

If k==0:

   print(area[0][n-1])

Else:

   total_area = area[0][n-1]

   low =0

   high = total_area

   answer =0

   while low <= high:

       mid = (low + high) //2

       # Compute max_regions for mid.

       # Initialize dp_regions.

       dp_regions = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

       # Generate sorted pairs by length.

       sorted_pairs = []

       for i in range(n):

           for j in range(n):

               if i ==j:

                   continue

               l = (j -i) %n +1

               if l >=3:

                   sorted_pairs.append( (l, i, j) )

       # Sort by length.

       sorted_pairs.sort()

       # Process each pair.

       for l, i, j in sorted_pairs:

           if area[i][j] < mid:

               dp_regions[i][j] =0

               continue

           max_regions =1

           for k in valid_ks[i][j]:

               if area[i][k] >= mid and area[k][j] >= mid:

                   current = dp_regions[i][k] + dp_regions[k][j]

                   if current > max_regions:

                       max_regions = current

           dp_regions[i][j] = max_regions

       current_max_regions = dp_regions[0][n-1]

       if current_max_regions >=k+1:

           answer = mid

           low = mid +1

       else:

           high = mid -1

   print(answer)

Wait, but the binary search loop is not correctly structured. The correct way to perform the binary search is:

low = 0

high = total_area

answer =0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    compute current_max_regions.

    if current_max_regions >=k+1:

        answer = mid

        low = mid +1

    else:

        high = mid -1

Thus, after the loop, answer is the maximum possible A.

Then, output answer.

But in the first example, the area of the minimal region is 11, which is the correct output. So the code should output 11.

But wait, the area stored is twice the area. So the code is correct.

But let's see the code's structure.

The code needs to precompute valid_ks for each i,j.

But generating valid_ks requires checking for each i, j, k whether len_ik >=3 and len_kj >=3.

Thus, the code should have:

valid_ks = [[[] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(n):

        if i ==j:

            continue

        for k in range(n):

            if k ==i or k ==j:

                continue

            len_ik = (k -i) %n +1

            len_kj = (j -k) %n +1

            if len_ik >=3 and len_kj >=3:

                valid_ks[i][j].append(k)

But in Python, lists are mutable, and this is manageable.

Thus, the code should work.

But for the sorted_pairs, when i and j are such that the sub-polygon has length >=3.

The code generates all pairs i, j (i !=j) with length >=3.

But in the sorted_pairs list, for i and j, the length is (j -i) %n +1.

Thus, the code processes all possible sub-polygons with at least 3 vertices.

But for example, the pair (i,j) and (j,i) would be considered different, but the code processes them as separate entries. However, this is correct.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But due to time and memory constraints, some optimizations are needed. For example, precomputing valid_ks and the sorted_pairs list once, and reusing them during each binary search step.

The code:

Read the input.

Precompute prefix sums.

Compute area.

Precompute valid_ks.

Precompute sorted_pairs.

Then, binary search.

Thus, the code:

Read n and k.

Read the n vertices into x and y lists.

Compute prefix sums.

Compute area.

Precompute valid_ks.

Precompute sorted_pairs.

If k ==0:

    print(area[0][n-1])

else:

    total_area = area[0][n-1]

    low = 0

    high = total_area

    answer =0

    # Precompute sorted_pairs once, as it's the same for all binary search steps.

    sorted_pairs = []

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            if i == j:

                continue

            l = (j -i) %n +1

            if l >=3:

                sorted_pairs.append( (l, i, j) )

    sorted_pairs.sort()

    # Binary search.

    while low <= high:

        mid = (low + high) //2

        # Compute DP.

        dp_regions = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

        for l, i, j in sorted_pairs:

            if area[i][j] < mid:

                dp_regions[i][j] =0

                continue

            max_regions =1

            for k in valid_ks[i][j]:

                # Check if the split into i..k and k..j is possible (area >= mid)

                if area[i][k] >= mid and area[k][j] >= mid:

                    current = dp_regions[i][k] + dp_regions[k][j]

                    if current > max_regions:

                        max_regions = current

            dp_regions[i][j] = max_regions

        current_max = dp_regions[0][n-1]

        if current_max >=k+1:

            answer = mid

            low = mid +1

        else:

            high = mid -1

    print(answer)

This code should work.

But let's test with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

8 4

-2 -4

2 -2

4 2

1 5

0 5

-4 4

-5 0

-5 -1

The total_area is area[0][7], which according to the first sample's output is 11. But wait, no. The output is 11, but that's the minimal region's area multiplied by 2. The total_area is the entire polygon's area multiplied by 2. Which must be larger than 11.

In any case, during the binary search, the code should find that the maximum possible A is 11, and thus output 11.

Thus, the code should correctly compute the answer.

Now, the code needs to handle the prefix sums correctly.

But in the code, the area is computed as:

Compute S, the prefix sums of the original polygon.

Then, for each i and j:

if i <j:

    sum_ = (S[j] - S[i]) + (x[j]*y[i] - x[i]*y[j])

else:

    sum_ = (S[n] - S[i]) + (S[j] - S[0]) + (x[j]*y[i] -x[i]*y[j])

sum_ = abs(sum_)

Thus, the code's area[i][j] is correct.

But let's see.

In the code, the prefix sums are computed as follows:

S[0] = 0

S[1] = x[0] * y[1] - x[1] * y[0]

S[2] = S[1] + x[1] * y[2] - x[2] * y[1]

...

S[n] = sum of all terms from 0 to n-1.

Then, for i=0 and j=7:

sum_ = (S[7] - S[0]) + (x[7] * y[0] - x[0] * y[7])

But this is for i <j.

Wait, but i=0 and j=7, which is i <j, so compute sum_ as (S[7] - S[0]) + (x[7] * y[0] - x[0] * y[7]).

But this is the correct sum for the sub-polygon 0..7.

Thus, the code computes the area correctly.

Thus, the code should work.
