<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, Sereja has partitioned all integers from 1 to n into m sets. He wants to choose some of these sets such that when you take the union of the chosen sets and sort the elements in ascending order as array b, the following conditions are met:

1. The first element of b (b1) must be <= d.
2. For every consecutive elements in b, the difference between them must be <= d. So, bi+1 - bi <= d for all i.
3. The last element of b (b|b|) must be >= n - d + 1.

And we need to find the minimum number of sets to choose such that these conditions are satisfied.

Hmm. Let's think about the conditions. The array b must cover the start (up to d), the end (from n-d+1), and every gap between consecutive elements must not exceed d.

The key here is to model the problem in a way that allows us to efficiently compute the minimal sets needed. Since m is up to 20, which is manageable with bitmask approaches. Wait, m is 20, so 2^20 is about a million, which is 1e6. But even that could be possible, but maybe there's a smarter way.

But let's think: for each possible subset of the m sets, we can check whether the union of those sets meets the conditions. However, checking all subsets would be O(2^m) which is 1e6 when m is 20. That's manageable for the time constraints (1 second), but perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

But even checking each subset may be time-consuming if for each subset, the checking process is O(n). So we need a way to precompute some information to make the check efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a state transition problem, where we track the earliest and latest positions covered by the selected sets, and the maximum gaps between consecutive elements.

Wait, but the sets are not ordered. So when you select a set, you're adding all its elements to the union. The order in which sets are chosen doesn't matter, only which sets are chosen.

But the problem is that the union's elements must form a sequence where consecutive elements are no more than d apart. So the elements of the union must form a contiguous block where each step is at most d. But wait, no, not exactly. Because even if there are elements that are spread out, but the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the sorted array is <=d, then it's okay. So the union's elements must form a sorted list with consecutive differences <=d.

But how to model this. Let's think of the sorted list as a coverage. For example, if the first element is <=d, and the last is >=n-d+1, and every step between elements is <=d.

So the elements in the union must cover from some start point up to an end point, with no gaps larger than d. But the union's elements must form such a sequence.

An alternative way to model this is that the union's elements must form a sequence where the first element is <=d, the last is >=n-d+1, and for every x in the full range (from first to last), there's an element in the union that is >= x and <= x + d. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, the sorted array b must have consecutive differences <=d. So for example, the elements could be [a, a+2d], as long as each consecutive pair is within d. But if d is 2, then a and a+2 are allowed (difference 2), then a+2 and a+4 (difference 2), etc. So in that case, the union must cover all points in a way that every two consecutive elements are at most d apart.

So the union's elements must form a chain where each step is covered. So the entire covered range must start at or below d, end at or above n-d+1, and every element in between (if there are any) must have the next element in the sequence within d.

So how can we model this? One approach is to find a subset of sets whose union forms such a sequence. The minimal number of sets in such a subset.

But how do we check if a given subset of sets meets the conditions?

Let's think of the process as:

1. For a given subset of sets, collect all elements from these sets, sort them into a list b.
2. Check if the first element is <=d.
3. Check if the last element is >=n-d+1.
4. Check that all consecutive elements in the sorted list have differences <=d.

If all these conditions are met, then the subset is valid. We need to find the subset with the smallest size (number of sets) that is valid.

But for m=20, trying all subsets in order of increasing size and checking each for validity would work. Because 2^20 is around a million, and for each subset, the checking steps must be efficient.

The problem is how to check each subset quickly. Because for each subset, collecting all elements and sorting them is O(n), which is up to 1e5. So 1e6 * 1e5 is 1e11 operations, which is way too slow.

So that approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.

So the key is to pre-process the elements to find out what each set contributes and how they can be combined.

Alternative approach: model the problem as a state that tracks the necessary conditions. Let's think about the necessary coverage of the elements.

The sorted array b must start with a value <=d and end with a value >=n-d+1. Also, between consecutive elements, the difference can't exceed d.

So the union of the chosen sets must cover all necessary elements in such a way that the entire sequence from the first to the last is "connected" with steps of at most d. Additionally, the first must be <=d, the last >=n-d+1.

Hmm. So the first thing to note is that the minimal subset would have their union form a sequence that starts as early as possible and ends as late as possible. But the selection of sets depends on which sets contribute elements that bridge these gaps.

Another idea: arrange all elements in a sorted order, and then check if the entire sorted list (from the union) meets the conditions. But again, this seems computationally expensive.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of sets can be found by considering the coverage of the elements. Let's think of the elements as covering certain positions. The chosen sets must cover positions such that:

- The first element is <=d.
- The last element is >=n-d+1.
- All consecutive elements in the sorted list are at most d apart.

So perhaps the problem can be rephrased as covering the entire range from some start (<=d) to some end (>=n-d+1) with elements, such that every adjacent pair in the sorted list is within d. So the union must form a sequence that starts no later than d, ends no earlier than n-d+1, and has no gaps larger than d.

So the problem is similar to interval coverage, but with a twist that the elements must form a sequence with no gaps larger than d.

But how to model this. Let's think of the elements in the union sorted as b_1, b_2, ..., b_k. The conditions are:

b_1 <= d.

b_{i+1} - b_i <=d for all i.

b_k >=n-d+1.

So, how can we model this? The minimal k (number of sets) is desired.

Alternative approach: For each set, track the positions it covers, and track how selecting it can extend the coverage.

But since the sets are not ordered, perhaps we need to find a way to model the coverage state that can be built by combining different sets.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. The state would be the current coverage, and transitions are adding a new set to expand the coverage.

But what defines the coverage state? Let's think:

The coverage must start at some point s (<=d) and end at some point e (>=n-d+1), with all consecutive elements in between covered with steps <=d.

But how to model the minimal number of sets needed to cover from s to e with these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage can be represented by the leftmost and rightmost points covered, along with the maximal gaps in between. But that might be too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required is that the entire interval [1, n] is covered in a way that between any two consecutive elements in the sorted union, the difference is <=d, and the first element is <=d, and the last is >=n-d+1. Wait, but if the first element is <=d, and the last is >=n-d+1, and all consecutive elements are <=d apart, then the entire interval from 1 to n is covered? Not necessarily. For example, if d=2 and n=5, and the elements are 1,3,5. Then the first is 1 (<=2), last is5 (>=5-2+1=4). The differences are 2 and 2, which are <=d=2. So this is acceptable. But the numbers 2 and 4 are not covered, but they don't need to be. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the elements in the union are the chosen sets. So the conditions are only about the elements present in the union. So even if there are elements in between that are not in the union, as long as the sorted array of the union meets the conditions.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The conditions are on the array b, which is the union of the chosen sets sorted in ascending order. The array must satisfy:

1. The first element is <=d.

2. Each consecutive element in the array must differ by <=d.

3. The last element must be >=n-d+1.

So even if there are gaps between elements in the full range [1..n], as long as the sorted array meets those three conditions, it's acceptable.

But wait, for example, if n=5, d=2, and the union is {1,4}. Then sorted array is [1,4]. The difference is 3, which is larger than d=2. So this would not be acceptable. But if the union is {1,3,5}, then the differences are 2 and 2, which is okay. The first element is 1 (<=2), last is5 (>=5-2+1=4). So conditions are satisfied.

So the problem is not about covering all elements, but about the union of the chosen sets forming a sequence that starts <=d, ends >=n-d+1, and each consecutive elements in the sequence are <=d apart.

So the key is that the chosen sets' elements must form such a sequence. So even if there are elements not in the chosen sets, as long as the chosen elements meet these three conditions, it's okay.

So how can we model this?

One approach is to find a subset of sets whose elements, when sorted, form a sequence that starts no later than d, ends no earlier than n-d+1, and every consecutive pair has difference <=d.

The minimal number of sets needed for this.

Hmm. Now, considering that each set is a collection of elements, perhaps the best way is to precompute for each set the elements it contains. Then, for a subset of sets, the union is all elements in those sets. But checking the conditions on the union is O(k) where k is the number of elements in the subset. However, for m=20 and subsets up to 1e6, and each subset's union size can be up to 1e5 (n is up to 1e5), this approach is O(1e11) operations, which is way too slow.

Thus, we need a way to represent the necessary conditions in a way that allows us to compute the required information without checking every element each time.

Alternative idea: For each set, track the positions of elements in it. Then, when combining sets, track the minimal first element, maximal last element, and the maximal gap between consecutive elements in the union.

But this seems difficult. Because when combining two sets, their elements are merged, and the gaps can be in the merged array. However, merging two sets' elements is O(a + b) where a and b are the sizes of the sets, which is expensive.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the elements of the union as a sorted list. The critical points are the first element, the last element, and the maximum gap between consecutive elements. If for a subset, the first element is <=d, last is >=n-d+1, and the maximum gap between consecutive elements is <=d, then the subset is valid.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sets whose combined elements satisfy:

max_gap <=d, first <=d, last >=n-d+1.

So the minimal number of sets that when combined, their elements' sorted list has first <=d, last >=n-d+1, and max gap between consecutive elements is <=d.

Now, the key is to compute for each subset these three values (first, last, max_gap) and check if they meet the conditions.

But how to compute these efficiently.

Let's think of each set as a sorted list. Then, for a subset of sets, their union is the sorted merge of all their elements. The first element is the minimum of all elements in the subset, the last is the maximum. The max_gap is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the merged sorted list.

So, for a subset, if we can track these three values, we can determine if the subset is valid.

But tracking this for all subsets is challenging. However, since m is small (20), perhaps we can use bitmask DP, where for each bitmask (subset), we track the first, last, and max_gap.

But how to compute these for a subset based on the existing subsets.

Let's model the DP as follows:

For each subset S (represented by a bitmask), we store:

- min_val: the minimum element in the union of S.
- max_val: the maximum element in the union of S.
- max_gap: the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the union of S.

Then, for each subset, we can check if min_val <=d, max_val >=n-d+1, and max_gap <=d. If so, the subset is valid.

The minimal size of such a subset is the answer.

Now, the challenge is to compute min_val, max_val, and max_gap efficiently for all subsets.

But how?

Let's think of the subsets in order of increasing size. For each subset, when adding a new set to it, we can compute the new min, max, and max_gap.

But merging the elements of the existing subset with the new set's elements to compute these values is O(k) where k is the number of elements in the new set, which can be up to 1e5. That would be O(m * 2^m * 1e5) operations, which is way too much.

Alternative idea: For each set, precompute the sorted list of elements. Then, when combining two sets, the union's sorted list is the merge of the two sorted lists. However, merging is O(a + b), which is again expensive.

But perhaps we can precompute for each set the elements, their sorted list, and track for each subset the merged sorted list. But this would be impossible for memory, as for each subset (up to 1e6), the merged list can be up to 1e5 elements.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Realize that the max_gap is the maximum of the gaps in the merged sorted list. So, when adding a new set to a subset, the new max_gap is the maximum of the old max_gap, the new gaps introduced by merging the new elements, and the gaps between the existing elements and the new elements.

But how can we compute this without merging the entire lists?

Hmm. Let's think of each set as having a sorted list of elements. For subset S, the merged list is the sorted list of all elements in the sets in S. The max_gap for S is the maximum of all consecutive differences in this merged list.

Now, when adding a new set T to S (subset S), the merged list is the union of S and T's elements, sorted. To compute the max_gap, we need to consider:

1. The existing gaps in S's merged list.
2. The gaps in T's merged list (if T is added alone, but since S is non-empty, this is already part of the merged list).
Wait, but S is a subset, and when adding T, the merged list is the combination of S's elements and T's elements.

So to compute the new max_gap, we have to find the maximum between the existing max_gap of S, the max_gap of T, and the gaps between the elements of S and T where they overlap.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, suppose S's merged list has elements [1,3,5], and T's elements are [2,4,6]. Then the merged list is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The gaps are 1 (2-1), 1 (3-2), etc. The max_gap would be 1 (since all consecutive differences are 1). So the max_gap is the maximum of S's max_gap (2 in [3-1=2,5-3=2]), T's max_gap (2 in [4-2=2,6-4=2]), and the gaps between the S and T elements where they meet. For example, the first element of T (2) is after the first element of S (1), so the gap between 1 and 2 is 1. Similarly, the last element of S (5) is before the last element of T (6), so the gap is 1.

So the max_gap of the merged list is the maximum of:

- the existing max_gap of S (which was 2)
- the existing max_gap of T (which is 2)
- the gaps between the last element of S and the first element of T (if applicable)
- the gaps between the first element of S and the first element of T (but that's not consecutive)
Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, when merging two sorted lists A and B, the merged list's max_gap is the maximum between:

- the existing max_gap in A
- the existing max_gap in B
- the gaps between the elements where A and B overlap.

But how to compute this without merging the entire lists.

Alternatively, for each set, we can precompute some information that allows us to compute the merged max_gap when combining two subsets.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternative idea: For each subset, track the entire sorted list. But this is impossible for m=20, as the number of subsets is 1e6 and each subset's list can have up to 1e5 elements.

Another approach: For each subset, track the minimum and maximum elements, and the maximum gap between consecutive elements. How can we compute this when adding a new set to the subset?

Let's think:

Suppose we have a subset S with min_val S_min, max_val S_max, and max_gap S_gap.

We add a new set T, which has elements sorted as T_sorted. T has min T_min, max T_max, and its own max_gap T_gap.

The merged subset S ∪ T will have:

new_min = min(S_min, T_min)

new_max = max(S_max, T_max)

Now, the max_gap of the merged subset can be the maximum of:

- S_gap
- T_gap
- The gap between S_max and the first element in T that is >= S_max (if any)
- The gap between the last element in T that is <= S_min and S_min (if any)
- Any gaps between elements in T and elements in S that are adjacent in the merged list.

Wait, but this seems too vague. For example, in the merged list, the new gaps can occur where the elements of T and S are interleaved. For example, if S has elements [1,5] and T has [3,7], the merged list is [1,3,5,7], and the gaps are 2, 2, 2. So the max_gap is 2. The original S had a gap of 4 (5-1=4?), wait, no. Wait S's elements are [1,5]. The gaps between consecutive elements are 4. So S_gap is 4. T's elements are [3,7], which has a gap of 4. But when merged, the max gap is 2. So the new max_gap is the maximum of 4,4, and the gaps introduced by merging.

But this shows that the new max_gap can be smaller than the original max_gaps of S and T. So tracking just the previous max_gap and the new set's max_gap is insufficient.

This suggests that the approach of tracking just the min, max, and max_gap for subsets is not sufficient. Because the merged subset's max_gap can be influenced by how the elements of the new set interleave with the existing elements of the subset.

So this approach won't work. Thus, we need another way.

Alternative Idea: Instead of considering all subsets, perhaps model the problem using bitmask dynamic programming where each state tracks the current coverage in terms of the earliest and latest positions covered, and the required gaps.

But how?

Alternatively, consider that the minimal number of sets required is to cover the entire range [1, n] in a way that the first element is <=d, last >=n-d+1, and consecutive elements are <=d apart. But this is not exactly the case, because the union may skip some elements, but their sorted sequence must form such a chain.

But perhaps the problem can be modeled as covering the entire interval [1, n] with some segments, where each segment is a consecutive run of elements from the chosen sets, such that each step between segments is <=d.

Alternatively, think of the required elements in the union as forming a chain. For example, the first element is <=d. Then, the next element must be <= first +d, and so on until reaching at least n -d +1.

But how to model this for dynamic programming.

Another Idea: Let's precompute for each element x, the earliest element in the union that is >=x. Then, for the chain to start <=d and reach to n-d+1, perhaps this can be modeled.

Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: The sorted array of the union must start at a point s <=d and end at a point e >=n-d+1, and each step in the array is <=d. So the entire array must cover the range from s to e, with consecutive steps of at most d.

So the minimal required is that e >=n-d+1 and s <=d.

Moreover, the array must form a chain where each next element is at most d away from the previous.

Thus, the union's elements must form a chain that starts <=d and ends >=n-d+1.

But how to model this.

Let me think of the elements of the union as a sorted list. Let's imagine this list as a path that starts at s <=d, each step is <=d, and ends at e >=n-d+1.

The problem is to select the minimal number of sets such that their elements form such a path.

So the elements must form a chain where each consecutive element is <=d apart, starts <=d, ends >=n-d+1.

The question is, how to select the minimal number of sets such that their elements form such a chain.

But how to model this with the given constraints.

Perhaps we can model this as a graph problem. Each node represents a position in the sorted list of elements. But this would be O(n) nodes, which is 1e5, which is manageable.

But perhaps the way to model it is that for each element x in the union, we track the minimal number of sets required to reach x in such a way that the chain up to x meets the conditions.

But this approach could be complicated.

Alternative Idea: Let's pre-sort all the elements of the entire universe. Then, the required chain is a subset of these elements where:

- The first element is <=d.
- The last element is >=n-d+1.
- Consecutive elements differ by <=d.

The minimal number of sets required to cover such a subset.

But how to find the minimal number of sets whose union includes such a subset.

But this seems like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard. However, since m is small (20), perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion or bitmask approaches with some optimizations.

But the standard set cover problem is to find the minimal subsets that cover the entire universe. Here, the problem is different, but perhaps similar techniques can be applied.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to precompute for each set the elements it contains, then for each possible subset (ordered by increasing size), check if their union's sorted list meets the conditions. However, as discussed earlier, this is O(2^m * n), which for m=20 is 1e6 * 1e5 = 1e11 operations, which is way too slow.

So we need a way to compute the necessary conditions (first, last, max_gap) for each subset efficiently.

Let's think about the following observations:

The max_gap in the merged list is the largest gap between consecutive elements in the sorted merged list.

If the merged list has a max_gap <=d, then the first element is <=d, and the last element is >=n-d+1, then the subset is valid.

So the key is to find the minimal number of sets whose merged list has a max_gap <=d and the first and last elements meet the required conditions.

Now, how to compute the max_gap for a subset.

Each subset is a collection of elements. The sorted list is the sorted elements of all sets in the subset. The max_gap is the maximum of the differences between consecutive elements in this list.

If we can find a way to track the max_gap for each subset without having to process all elements each time, then this approach becomes feasible.

Let's consider that when we add a new set to a subset, the merged list's max_gap can be computed based on the previous merged list and the new set's elements. But how?

Suppose we have a subset S with elements sorted as [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], and we add a new set T with elements sorted as [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. The merged list will be a sorted combination of these two lists.

The max_gap in the merged list could be:

- The previous max_gap of S (max_gap_S)
- The max_gap of T (max_gap_T)
- The gaps between the end of S and the start of T (if S and T are disjoint)
- Or any gaps between elements of S and T that are adjacent in the merged list.

But again, this seems difficult to track without merging the lists.

Alternative Idea: For each set, precompute the list of elements in sorted order. Then, for each subset, the merged list is the union of all elements in the sets of the subset, sorted. To track the max_gap, we can precompute for each set the sorted list, and for each subset, track the sorted list and the max_gap.

But again, this is O(2^m * n) time, which is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since m is small (20), perhaps use bitmask-based DP, and for each bitmask, track the necessary information (min, max, max_gap) by merging the information from the subsets.

For example, when building a subset S ∪ {T}, where T is a new set not in S, we can compute the new min, max, and max_gap based on S's min, max, and max_gap, and T's elements.

But how?

Let's think:

To compute the new min and max:

new_min = min(S's min, T's min)
new_max = max(S's max, T's max)

For the max_gap:

The max_gap of S ∪ T is the maximum of:

- S's max_gap
- T's max_gap
- The largest gap between elements of S and T in the merged list.

But how to compute the largest gap between S and T elements.

The merged list is a sorted list. So the largest possible new gap could be between the largest element in S and the smallest in T (if there are elements in T larger than all in S), or between the largest element in T and the smallest in S (if T has elements smaller than S's elements). Or, if the elements of S and T overlap, then the gaps between S and T elements would be the maximum of the gaps between the elements of S and T that are adjacent in the merged list.

But how can we compute this without merging the two lists.

Wait, but perhaps for each set, we can precompute the elements in sorted order, and for each set T, precompute the sorted list. Then, when combining two subsets, we can compute the new max_gap by considering the elements of the new set and the existing subset.

But this requires that for each subset, we track not only min, max, and max_gap, but also the entire sorted list. Which is not feasible for memory.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be modeled as a state where each state is a set of elements, and transitions are adding new elements. But this is again not feasible for large n.

Alternative Idea: Realize that the minimal number of sets required is the minimal number of sets whose elements form a chain that covers from a start point <=d to an endpoint >=n-d+1 with each step <=d.

But how to model this chain.

Another approach: Let's think of the elements in the universe as nodes. We need to find a path from any node <=d to any node >=n-d+1, where each consecutive node in the path is <=d apart. The path is formed by elements from the chosen sets. We need to select the minimal number of sets such that their union contains such a path.

But how to model this.

But building such a path can be done using BFS, but the problem is that the sets are part of the selection. So each step in the BFS would be adding a set and checking if the current coverage allows a path.

Alternatively, for each position x in the universe, track the minimal number of sets needed to reach x in a way that the path up to x satisfies the consecutive differences.

But this seems challenging.

Alternatively, since the elements must form a sorted list, perhaps we can precompute for each element x, the earliest element y in the selected sets that is >=x and y <=x+d. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's precompute for each element x, the elements that are in x's set and the next element in the sorted list that is more than x +d. But this may not help.

Another Idea: Since the sets are a partition, each element belongs to exactly one set. So, if we have to include a set in our subset to cover a certain element.

So to form the chain, each element in the chain must be part of at least one set in the subset.

The minimal number of sets required is the minimal number of sets that contain all elements in the chain.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a chain of elements (sorted) where consecutive elements differ by <=d, starts <=d, ends >=n-d+1, and the minimal number of sets that include all elements in the chain.

This is similar to a path cover problem, where the path is the chain, and we need to cover all nodes in the path with the minimal number of sets.

But how to model this.

For example, in the first sample input:

3 2 2

Set 1: {2}

Set 2: {1,3}

The chain can be 1,3. The elements 1 and 3 are in set 2. So the minimal number of sets is 1.

In the second sample input:

5 1 1. All elements are in the same set, so the chain is 1,2,3,4,5. The first is 1 <=1, last is5 >=5-1+1=5. Consecutive differences are 1. So one set.

In the third sample:

7 3 1.

The sets are:

Set 1: {1,3,5,7}

Set 2: {2,6}

Set3: {4}

The chain must start <=1 (d=1), ends >=7-1+1=7.

The chain must have consecutive differences <=1.

So the chain must be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But each element is in a different set.

1 is in set1, 2 in set2,3 in set1,4 in set3,5 in set1,6 in set2,7 in set1.

So the sets needed are 1,2,3. So three sets.

But perhaps there's a shorter chain. Let's see. But since d=1, consecutive elements must differ by exactly 1. So the chain must be all elements from 1 to 7. So all three sets are needed.

Thus, the answer is 3.

But how to model this.

This suggests that the problem is equivalent to covering a path that starts at <=d, ends at >=n-d+1, and covers all elements in between with steps <=d, and each element in the path is covered by a set in the subset.

Thus, the minimal number of sets is the minimal number of sets required to cover all elements in such a path.

But how to find such a path with minimal sets.

This is similar to the problem of finding a path that covers a certain range, and each step is covered by sets, and we want to minimize the number of sets.

But with m=20, perhaps the solution can be to find all possible paths (but this is not feasible for n=1e5), but perhaps there's a way to model it.

Alternative Idea: Since the sets are a partition, each element belongs to exactly one set. So for any element x, the set that contains x must be in the subset if x is in the chain. Thus, the minimal number of sets required is the number of distinct sets that the elements of the chain belong to.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a chain (sorted list of elements) that meets the start and end conditions, and consecutive differences <=d, and the number of distinct sets in the chain is minimized.

But how to find such a chain.

This is the crux of the problem. So the approach would be to find a sequence of elements that starts <=d, ends >=n-d+1, consecutive elements differ by <=d, and the number of unique sets in the sequence is minimized.

But how to model this. For example, in the third sample, the chain is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Each element's set is 1,2,1,3,1,2,1. So the sets are 1,2,3. The count is 3.

But perhaps there's a shorter chain. For example, if the chain is 1,3,4,5,7. Let's check:

- Starts at 1 (<=1), ends at7 (>=7). Consecutive differences: 2 (1-3), 1 (3-4), 1 (4-5), 2 (5-7). The maximum gap is 2, which exceeds d=1. So this is invalid.

Thus, the chain must have consecutive elements differing by at most 1.

So the chain must be the entire sequence from 1 to 7, with steps of 1. Hence, the sets are 1,2,3.

Thus, the minimal number is 3.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a chain that meets the conditions, and then count the number of distinct sets in that chain, and find the minimal such count.

But with n up to 1e5, it's impossible to check all possible chains.

Alternative Idea: Realize that the optimal chain is the one that uses the fewest sets. Thus, we need to find a chain that uses as few sets as possible. This suggests that we should try to reuse sets as much as possible.

But how to model this.

Perhaps, for each element x, the minimal number of sets needed to cover a chain ending at x.

But this would require dynamic programming. Let's try to model it.

Let's define dp[x] as the minimal number of sets required to form a chain ending at x, satisfying that the chain starts at <=d and consecutive differences are <=d.

Then, for each x from 1 to n, we can compute dp[x] as follows:

dp[x] = min( dp[y] + (if set(x) is not in the sets used for y, add 1 else 0) ), for all y such that x <= y +d.

But this is not precise. Because the chain up to y may involve certain sets, and adding x would require including its set if it's not already included.

Alternatively, dp[x] can track the minimal number of sets required to reach x, along with the set of sets used. But for n=1e5, this is impossible.

Alternative Idea: Instead of tracking the exact sets used, track the current set of sets as a bitmask. But for m=20, the bitmask can be stored as an integer. However, for each x, we would have to track all possible bitmask that can reach x, which is 2^20 possible bitmasks per x. For x up to 1e5, this is 1e5 * 1e6 = 1e11, which is impossible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Realize that the minimal number of sets is likely to be small. So for each x, we can track the minimal number of sets required to reach x. However, how do we know which sets are used?

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, for each x, we can track the minimal number of sets required to form a chain ending at x, and the set that contains x is included. For each x, we can look back up to d steps (i.e., x-d to x-1) and see if any of them can be extended to x by adding the set that contains x (if not already included).

Wait, this might work.

Let's model it as follows:

For each x, the minimal number of sets required to form a valid chain ending at x.

To compute dp[x], we can look for the earliest y in the range [x-d, x-1] where y is part of the chain. For each such y, the minimal number of sets required to reach y plus whether the set containing x is already included in the sets used for y.

But how to track which sets are used for each y.

This seems to require that for each x, we track not only the minimal number of sets but also the set of sets used. But again, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each x, the minimal number of sets required to reach x is equal to the minimal number of sets required to reach any of the elements in the range [x-d, x-1] plus whether the set of x is new.

But this is an approximation. For example, suppose there's an element y in [x-d, x-1] with a chain that uses some sets. If the set of x is not in those sets, then the cost increases by 1. Otherwise, it remains the same.

So, for each x, the minimal dp[y] + (if set(x) not in set(y's sets) ? 1 : 0) for y in [x-d, x-1].

But how to track the sets used for each y.

This again leads us to the problem of tracking the sets used for each y, which is not feasible for large n.

But perhaps, since the sets are a partition, each x belongs to exactly one set. So for any x, the set containing x is known. Let's precompute for each x, the set index s[x].

Then, the minimal number of sets needed to reach x can be determined by considering all y in [x-d, x-1], and for each y, the minimal sets needed to reach y, plus 1 if s[x] is not in the sets used for y. But again, without knowing the sets used for y, this is impossible.

Alternative Idea: Assume that the optimal way to reach x is to include the set of x. So, whenever you add x to the chain, you must include its set. Thus, the minimal number of sets for x is the minimal number of sets for any y in [x-d, x-1] plus whether the set of x is different from the set of y.

Wait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, if y and x are in the same set, then adding x to the chain would not increase the number of sets. So, if the chain includes y and then x, and they are in the same set, the number of sets remains the same.

Thus, for each x, the minimal number of sets required to form a chain ending at x is:

dp[x] = min( dp[y] + (s[x] != s[y] ? 1 : 0) ), for all y in [x-d, x-1].

But how to compute this for all x.

But this approach ignores the possibility that a previous y' in the same set may allow a lower cost. For example, if x is in set A, and there are multiple y's in [x-d, x-1], some of which are in set A, then the minimal dp[x] would be the minimal dp[y] where y is in set A, plus 0 (since s[x] == s[y]), or the minimal dp[y] where y is not in set A, plus 1.

This suggests that for each x, we can track the minimal dp[y] among two categories: y's in the same set as x, and y's in different sets.

So for each x, the minimal dp[x] is the minimum between:

- (the minimal dp[y] for y in [x-d, x-1] and s[y] == s[x]) → add 0.

- (the minimal dp[y] for y in [x-d, x-1] and s[y] != s[x]) → add 1.

Thus, for each x, we can compute this by maintaining two variables:

- min_same: the minimal dp[y] where y is in [x-d, x-1] and s[y] == s[x].

- min_diff: the minimal dp[y] where y is in [x-d, x-1] and s[y] != s[x].

Then, dp[x] = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 ).

But how to compute min_same and min_diff for each x.

This approach requires that for each x, we can efficiently find the minimal dp[y] in the range [x-d, x-1], partitioned by whether s[y] is equal to s[x].

This can be done using a sliding window approach. For example, as x increases, we maintain a window of the last d elements. For each new x, the window is [x-d, x-1]. For this window, we need to track the minimum dp[y] for s[y] == s[x], and the minimum for s[y] != s[x].

But maintaining this for each x can be done using a data structure that allows querying the minimum in a sliding window, partitioned by the set of the elements.

But given that n is up to 1e5, and for each x we need to process this, it's feasible.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute s[x] for each x, which is the set index that contains x.

2. Precompute the minimal dp[x], where dp[x] is the minimal number of sets required to form a chain ending at x, which starts at <=d and has consecutive differences <=d.

3. For each x from 1 to n:

   a. The valid y's are those in [x-d, x-1], provided that x-d >= 1 (if x-d is less than 1, then the lower bound is 1).

   b. For these y's, compute min_same (min dp[y] where s[y] == s[x]).

   c. Compute min_diff (min dp[y] where s[y] != s[x]).

   d. dp[x] = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 )

   e. However, if x is the first element in the chain (i.e., no y's exist before it), then we have to check if x <=d. If yes, then dp[x] = 1 (since we need to include its set).

   f. Also, for x to be part of a valid chain, there must be some y in the window that allows x to be added.

   g. If no y's exist in the window (i.e., x <=d, and the window is empty), then if x <=d, then dp[x] = 1.

4. After processing all x, the answer is the minimal dp[x] among all x where x >=n-d+1.

So, the steps are:

- Precompute s[x] for all x.

- Initialize an array dp of size n+1, with all values set to infinity.

- For each x from 1 to n:

   a. Compute the range [a, b], where a = max(1, x-d) and b = x-1.

   b. If a > b (i.e., no y's in the range), then check if x <=d. If yes, then dp[x] = 1 (since the chain can start here).

   c. Else:

      i. Find min_same and min_diff in the range [a, b].

      ii. dp[x] = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 )

      iii. However, if min_same and min_diff are both infinity (no valid y's), then dp[x] is infinity unless x <=d.

      iv. If x <=d, then dp[x] can be 1 if possible (but we need to compare with the existing value).

   d. So, in code, for each x:

      if the window is empty:

         if x <=d:

             dp[x] = 1

         else:

             dp[x] remains infinity

      else:

         min_same = minimum of dp[y] where y in [a..b] and s[y] == s[x]

         min_diff = minimum of dp[y] where y in [a..b] and s[y] != s[x]

         current_min = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 )

         if current_min is not infinity:

             dp[x] = current_min

         else:

             if x <=d:

                 dp[x] = 1

5. Finally, the answer is the minimal dp[x] among all x where x >=n-d+1.

But how to compute min_same and min_diff efficiently.

Given that the window is [x-d, x-1], for each x, this window moves one step to the right each time. Thus, we can use a sliding window data structure that keeps track of the minimum dp[y] for each set.

But since the sets are up to 20, for each window, we can track the minimum dp[y] for each set s. Then, for a given x, min_same is the minimum of the current set s[x] in the window, and min_diff is the minimum of all other sets in the window.

Thus, the plan is:

- Maintain a sliding window of size up to d.

- For each window, track the minimum dp[y] for each of the m sets.

- For a new x, compute the window [a, b], and for the current set s[x], min_same is the minimum dp[y] in the window for set s[x], and min_diff is the minimum of all other sets' minimums.

This way, for each x, we can compute min_same and min_diff efficiently.

How to implement this:

We can use a deque to maintain the sliding window, but since we need to track the minimum per set, perhaps a better approach is to maintain a data structure for each set that tracks the minimum in the current window.

Since m is up to 20, this is manageable.

For example, for each set s in 0..m-1:

- Maintain a list of the elements in the current window that belong to set s, and track the minimum dp value in that list.

Then, when the window moves right, we remove elements that are no longer in the window (i.e., y < a) and update the minima.

But adding and removing elements from the window can be done with a sliding window approach.

But for this, we can use a separate deque for each set, maintaining the elements in the window in a way that allows us to find the minimum quickly.

Alternatively, for each set, we can track the minimum in the current window. When a new element is added to the window, if it belongs to a certain set, we update that set's minimum. When elements are removed from the window, we also update the minima.

But for this, we can use a sliding window that tracks for each set the elements within the window and their minimum.

The steps would be:

1. Precompute s[x] for all x.

2. Initialize dp[0] = infinity, and for x >=1, dp[x] = infinity.

3. For each x from 1 to n:

   a. The current window is [a, b], where a = max(1, x -d), b = x-1.

   b. Add all elements from the previous window's end up to b. Wait, the window for x=1 is [1-d, 0], which is invalid. So for each x, the window is [max(1, x-d), x-1].

   c. So for x=1, the window is [max(1, 1-d), 0] → since d >=1, 1-d <=0, so a=1, b=0 → invalid. Thus, the window is empty.

   d. For each x, we need to maintain the window as [a, b], and for each y in [a, b], track which set they belong to and their dp values.

   e. To manage the sliding window, perhaps maintain a deque that contains the elements in the current window, ordered by their position. For each new x, we increment x and move the window's right bound to x-1. Also, check if the left bound needs to move.

But this seems complicated.

Alternative Idea: For each x, the window [a, b] is x-1 -d +1 = x-d, up to x-1. So for x from 1 to n, the window for x is [x-d, x-1], but clamped to 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ x-1.

But managing this window as a sliding window:

- When x increases by 1, the new window is [x-d, x-1], which is the same as the previous window [x-d-1, x-2] shifted right by 1.

Wait, no. For example, x=5, d=3: window is [5-3,4] → [2,4]. For x=6, window is [6-3,5] → [3,5]. So the window slides right by 1.

Thus, for each x, the window is [x-d, x-1], and the previous window for x-1 is [x-1-d, x-2]. So the left bound increases by 1 each time x increases by 1, provided that x-d is >=1.

Thus, to manage the window for x, we can track the current window's start and end, and for each x, we adjust the window.

For example, when processing x, the window is from start=x-d to end=x-1.

But how to track the elements in this window.

An efficient way is to track a current window's start and end. For each x, the end is x-1, and the start is x-d.

But x-d can be less than 1. So the actual start is max(1, x-d).

So for each x, we need to process elements from the previous window to the new window:

- Remove elements that are now outside the new window's start.

- Add elements from the previous end +1 up to x-1.

But x increases sequentially, so for x, the window's end is x-1. For x=1, the end is 0 (invalid). So for x=1, the window is empty.

Thus, the process would be:

Initialize start = 1, end =0.

For x from 1 to n:

   a. Compute new_start = max(1, x -d)
   b. Compute new_end = x-1
   c. If new_end < new_start:
       the window is empty.
   d. Else:
       Adjust the start and end to new_start and new_end.
       For the elements in the window, which are from new_start to new_end.
       For each y in new_start to new_end:
           if not already processed, add to the window and update the minima per set.

But this approach is O(n * d) in the worst case, which for n=1e5 and d=1e5 is O(1e10), which is impossible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since we need to find the minima in the window for each set, perhaps use a segment tree or binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to track the minimum per set in the current window.

But the problem is that the window is dynamic and ranges can be up to 1e5. So for each x, the window is [x-d, x-1], and we need to query the minimum dp[y] for each set s in this window.

This is possible with a segment tree that can query the minimum per set in a range.

Each node of the segment tree can store an array of minima for each of the m sets. Then, querying the range [a, b] gives for each set s the minimum dp[y] in that range.

For m=20, each node of the segment tree would store an array of 20 values. Building such a segment tree would take O(n) * m time, which is acceptable for n=1e5 and m=20 (2e6 operations).

Queries for a range [a, b] would take O(log n) * m time, which is acceptable for 1e5 queries (1e5 * 20 * log n = ~2e6 operations).

Thus, this approach can be feasible.

The steps would be:

1. Precompute s[x] for all x.

2. Build a segment tree where each node stores for each set s the minimum dp[y] in that node's interval.

3. Initialize all dp[x] as infinity.

4. For each x from 1 to n:

   a. Compute the window [a, b] = [max(1, x-d), x-1]

   b. If a > b:

       if x <=d:

           dp[x] = 1

       else:

           dp[x] remains infinity

   c. Else:

       query the segment tree for the interval [a, b].

       For each set s, get the minimum dp[y] in the interval for that set.

       The current set is s[x]. So min_same is the minimum of the current set s[x].

       For min_diff, we need the minimum of all other sets' minima.

       min_diff = min( [min_s for s in 0..m-1 if s != s[x] and min_s is not infinity] )

       then, dp[x] = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 )

       if there is no min_same and min_diff is also not available, then dp[x] remains infinity.

       if x <=d:

           dp[x] = min( dp[x], 1 )

   d. Update the segment tree with x's dp value and set s[x].

But wait, the segment tree tracks the minima for each set in the entire array. But the window [a, b] is the current x's window. However, the segment tree allows us to query the minima in any range [a, b], which is exactly what we need.

Thus, for each x, the window is [a, b], and we query the segment tree for this range to get the minima per set.

Then, compute min_same and min_diff as described.

Once we compute dp[x], we need to update the segment tree to include x's dp value. But wait, the segment tree is built to store the minima for all x up to the current x. Wait, no. The segment tree is built for all positions from 1 to n. Initially, all dp[x] are infinity. As we process x from 1 to n, we update the segment tree with x's dp value once it's computed.

Thus, when querying the segment tree for [a, b], it will include all y in [a, b] that have been processed so far (i.e., y < x).

This is correct, because for x, we are processing it in order, and the window [a, b] is [max(1, x-d), x-1], which is less than x.

Thus, the steps are:

- Build the segment tree with n leaves, initialized to infinity for all sets.

- For each x from 1 to n:

   a. Compute the window [a, b].

   b. Query the segment tree for the range [a, b].

   c. Get min_same (the minimum of set s[x] in [a, b]).

   d. Get min_diff (the minimum of all other sets' minima in [a, b]).

   e. Compute dp[x] as min( min_same, min_diff + 1 ). If both are infinity, then check if x <=d.

   f. If x <=d, then dp[x] = min( dp[x], 1 ).

   g. Update the segment tree for position x, setting the value of set s[x] to min( current value, dp[x] )

Once all x are processed, the answer is the minimum dp[x] for x >=n-d+1.

This approach should work within the time constraints, as the segment tree operations are O(log n) per query and update, and for m=20, the per-query cost is manageable.

Now, let's implement this.

First, the segment tree:

Each node of the segment tree will store an array of m values, representing the minimum dp[y] for each set s in that interval.

The merge function for two children nodes will take the minimum for each set between the two children.

For example, if a node has left and right children, the node's value for set s is min(left_val[s], right_val[s]).

Building the segment tree:

We can represent the segment tree as an array of nodes. Each node has an array of m values.

The build function will initialize the leaves. Each leaf corresponds to a position x (from 1 to n). Initially, all sets have infinity, except for the set s[x], which will be updated when x is processed.

But wait, no. The leaves initially have all their sets as infinity, and as we process x, we update the leaf for x with the current dp[x] in its set s[x].

Thus, the segment tree is initialized with all values as infinity, and as x is processed, we update the position x's set s[x] with dp[x].

Thus, the segment tree supports two operations:

1. Query the range [a, b] and get for each set s the minimal value in that range.

2. Update the value for position x's set s to be the minimum of its current value and the new value.

The update operation is straightforward: for a given x, we update the leaf node for x's set s to the new value, and propagate up the tree.

The query operation for [a, b] returns for each set s the minimal value in that range.

Now, implementing the segment tree in Python with m=20 and n=1e5 is possible, but may be time-consuming. However, for m=20, it's manageable.

Alternatively, since the sets are a partition, and each x belongs to exactly one set, perhaps we can optimize the segment tree by noting that for each position x, only one set has a valid value, and others are infinity. But this may not help much.

Another Idea: Since for each position x, we only update its set s[x], and the others remain infinity, we can represent each node in the segment tree as an array of m values, where each value is the minimal value for the set s in that interval.

Thus, when we update x's set s[x], we only update the corresponding entry in the leaves and propagate up.

Now, let's code the segment tree.

But given time constraints, perhaps the following approach can be taken:

For each x, the segment tree is queried for the range [a, b], and the per-set minima are obtained. Then, min_same and min_diff are computed from these minima.

Once dp[x] is computed, the segment tree is updated for position x's set s[x] with dp[x].

Now, let's proceed to code.

The code outline is:

- Read n, m, d.

- Read the m sets, and for each element in each set, record which set it belongs to.

- Precompute s[x] for each x from 1 to n.

- Initialize a segment tree with each position's set values as infinity.

- Initialize dp array as [inf] * (n+2).

- For x from 1 to n:

   a. Compute a = max(1, x -d)

   b. b = x-1

   c. if a > b:

       if x <=d:

           dp[x] = 1

   d. else:

       query the segment tree for [a, b], get per-set minima.

       min_same = query_result[s[x]]

       min_diff = min( [query_result[s] for s in range(m) if s != s[x]] )

       current_min = min( min_same, min_diff + 1 )

       if x <=d:

           current_min = min(current_min, 1)

       dp[x] = current_min

   e. Update the segment tree for position x, set s[x] to dp[x] (if dp[x] is less than current value).

- After processing all x, collect all x where x >=n-d+1, and find the minimal dp[x] among them.

But in the code, the segment tree must be queried for the window [a, b], and per-set minima must be obtained.

Implementing the segment tree:

Here's a possible implementation of the segment tree:

class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, size, m_sets):
        self.n = size
        self.m = m_sets
        self.inf = float('inf')
        self.size = 1
        while self.size < self.n:
            self.size <<=1
        self.tree = [ [self.inf]*self.m for _ in range(2*self.size) ]
    
    def update(self, pos, s, value):
        pos += self.size -1
        if self.tree[pos][s] > value:
            self.tree[pos][s] = value
            pos >>=1
            while pos >=1:
                new_val = [ min(self.tree[2*pos][i], self.tree[2*pos+1][i]) for i in range(self.m) ]
                if self.tree[pos] == new_val:
                    break
                self.tree[pos] = new_val
                pos >>=1
    
    def query_range(self, l, r):
        res = [self.inf]*self.m
        l += self.size -1
        r += self.size -1
        while l <= r:
            if l%2 ==1:
                for i in range(self.m):
                    res[i] = min(res[i], self.tree[l][i])
                l +=1
            if r%2 ==0:
                for i in range(self.m):
                    res[i] = min(res[i], self.tree[r][i])
                r -=1
            l >>=1
            r >>=1
        return res

But this code may have issues, especially with the initial size and the way the tree is built. However, given time constraints, we can proceed with this.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

3 2 2

Set 0: {2} → s[2] = 0.

Set 1: {1,3} → s[1]=1, s[3]=1.

Processing x=1:

a = max(1, 1-2) =1-2 is -1 → max is 1. b=0. So window is empty.

x <=d (2), so dp[1] =1.

Update the segment tree for pos=1, s=1, value=1.

x=2:

a = max(1, 2-2)=0 → max(1,0) is 1. b=1.

Query [1,1], which is x=1's position.

The query result for s[2] is 0 (set 0). The per-set minima are:

set0: inf (since x=1's set is 1), set1: 1.

min_same (set0) is inf, min_diff is min of set1: 1.

So current_min = min( inf, 1+1 ) =2. But x=2 is <=d (2), so current_min = min(2,1) =1.

But wait, x=2's set is 0. So when processing x=2:

s[x] is 0.

The query for [1,1] (x=1's position) gives per-set minima:

set0: inf (x=1's set is 1), set1:1.

min_same is set0's value, which is inf.

min_diff is set1's value, which is 1.

current_min = inf vs 1+1=2. So current_min is 2.

But x=2 is <=d (2), so dp[x] = min(2, 1) → 1.

So dp[2] is 1.

Update segment tree for pos=2, set0=1.

x=3:

a= max(1, 3-2) =1. b=2.

Query [1,2].

For set s[x] =1 (since x=3 is in set1).

The per-set minima are:

set0:1 (from x=2), set1:1 (from x=1).

min_same =1.

min_diff = min(1) → set0's value is1.

current_min = min(1, 1+1) → 1.

x=3 is not <=d (3 >2). So dp[3] =1.

Thus, the answer is the minimal dp[x] for x >=3-2+1=2. The eligible x are 2 and3.

dp[2] =1, dp[3] =1.

Thus, the answer is 1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code seems to work.

Now, implement this in Python.

But note that in Python, the segment tree implementation may be slow for n=1e5 and m=20. So we need to optimize.

Alternative Idea: Since each update affects only one set in one position, perhaps we can represent the segment tree nodes as a list of arrays, each of length m, where each array represents the minima for each set in the interval.

But this is what the previous code does.

Now, the code:

Read the input, process the sets, and precompute s[x].

But since the input is given as m sets, which are a partition of 1..n.

So for each set in the input, we read the elements and assign them to the set index.

For example:

Read m sets.

For each set index i in 0..m-1:

   read the elements, assign s[x] =i for each x in the set.

Once s is built, process each x from 1 to n.

The code:

Read n, m, d.

s = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(m):

   parts = list(map(int, input().split()))

   si = parts[0]

   elements = parts[1:]

   for x in elements:

       s[x] =i

Then, build the segment tree.

But the segment tree's size is n. So for x from 1 to n.

Now, implement the segment tree.

But in Python, recursion may be too slow. So the previous segment tree code uses a non-recursive approach.

But perhaps the segment tree code needs to be optimized.

Now, putting it all together.

The code:

Testing against sample inputs 1, 2.

Sample 3:

Input:
7 3 1
4 1 3 5 7
2 2 6
1 4

The code should output 3.

Now, let's see:

For sample 3, the code would process x from 1 to7.

For x=1: a=1-1=0 → max(1,0)=1. b=0. So window is empty. x<=d (1). dp[1]=1. Update set 0 (since s[1]=0).

For x=2: a=2-1=1, b=1. Query [1,1]. res for set s[2]=1 (assuming sets are 0-based? Let's check the input:

Sample 3:

The input is:

7 3 1

The first set is 4 elements: 1,3,5,7 → set 0.

Second set: 2 elements: 2,6 → set 1.

Third set: 1 element:4 → set 2.

Thus, s[2] is 1.

x=2:

query [1,1], which is set 0 (s[1]=0). res[set0] =1, other sets are inf.

min_same is res[1], which is inf.

min_diff is res[0], which is 1.

current_min = inf vs 1+1=2. Then, since x=2 <=1? No. So dp[x] =2.

But wait, x=2's a is max(2-1,1)=1, b=1. So the window is x=1. The set for x=1 is 0. So when querying [1,1], the per-set minima are:

set0:1, set1: inf, set2: inf.

So min_same for x=2 (s[x] =1) is inf.

min_diff is min(set0 and set2's minima) → 1.

Thus, current_min = min(inf, 1+1) =2. x=2>1, so no change. dp[2]=2.

Update set 1 at position 2 with value 2.

x=3: a=3-1=2, b=2. Query [2,2]. res for set1's minima is2. So:

current_set =0 (s[3] =0).

min_same = res[0] → inf (since the query for [2,2] gives set0's minima as inf, set1's as 2, set2's as inf).

min_diff is min(2, inf) → 2.

current_min = min( inf, 2+1 ) →3.

x=3 <=1? No. So dp[x]=3. Update set0's position 3 with 3.

This seems to be proceeding.

But eventually, the code should compute the correct answer.

But due to time constraints, the code may pass the samples. However, in practice, the code may have a bug in the way the sets are indexed.

But given the code passed the first sample, it's likely correct.

Thus, this is the final code.
