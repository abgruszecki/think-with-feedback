Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem is about determining the winner of a Nim game based on the configuration of dumpers from different quarries. The key here is to compute the XOR of all the pile sizes (Grundy numbers) in the game. If the XOR is non-zero, the first player (tolik) wins; otherwise, the second player (bolik) does. 

But wait, each quarry has multiple dumpers. Each dumper's stone count is xi, xi+1, ..., xi + mi -1. So for each quarry, we have a consecutive sequence of stones in each dumper. The problem reduces to calculating the XOR of all these individual dumper's stones and then XORing all those together. If the total XOR is non-zero, tolik wins; else, bolik.

But calculating each individual dumper's stone count and XOR them all directly is impossible here. Because mi can be up to 1e16, and there are up to 1e5 quarries. So for each quarry, we can't iterate through all mi dumpers. We need a mathematical way to compute the XOR of a consecutive sequence of numbers from a to a + m -1 efficiently.

Hmm, so the main challenge is to compute the XOR of a consecutive sequence of numbers efficiently. Let's recall that the XOR from 0 to n can be computed quickly using a formula based on n mod 4. But here, the sequence starts at a (which can be any positive integer) and has length m. So how do we compute the XOR of a, a+1, ..., a+m-1?

Let's think. The XOR from a to b can be found by XORing the XOR from 0 to b with the XOR from 0 to a-1. So, if we can compute the XOR from 0 to x, then XOR(a to b) = f(b) XOR f(a-1). 

So for a single quarry with starting xi and mi, the XOR contribution is the XOR of xi, xi+1, ..., xi + mi -1. Which is equal to f(xi + mi -1) XOR f(xi - 1). 

So, for each quarry, compute this value and accumulate the total XOR. Then, if the total is non-zero, output tolik; else, bolik.

So the key is to compute f(x), which is the XOR from 0 to x. How is that done?

The formula for f(x) is as follows:

f(x) = x if x mod 4 == 0
f(x) = 1 if x mod 4 == 1
f(x) = x + 1 if x mod 4 == 2
f(x) = 0 if x mod 4 ==3

Yes, that's a well-known formula. So for each x, we can compute f(x) in O(1) time.

So putting this all together:

For each quarry i:
a = xi
b = xi + mi -1
xorr = compute_xor(a, b) which is f(b) ^ f(a-1)
Add this xorr to the total_xor (by XORing it into the total).

Once all quarries are processed, check if total_xor is non-zero. If yes, tolik wins; else, bolik.

So the problem reduces to correctly implementing the compute_xor function and handling very large numbers (up to 1e16). Let's make sure that the code can handle numbers up to 1e16, but in Python, that's not a problem.

Now, the steps:

1. Read n.
2. For each of n lines, read xi and mi.
3. For each xi and mi, compute a = xi, b = xi + mi -1.
4. Compute the XOR from a to b using f(b) ^ f(a-1).
5. XOR this into the total_xor.
6. After processing all quarries, output 'tolik' if total_xor is not zero, else 'bolik'.

Now, the function compute_f(x) to compute XOR from 0 to x:

def compute_f(x):
    mod = x %4
    if mod ==0:
        return x
    elif mod ==1:
        return 1
    elif mod ==2:
        return x+1
    else: # mod ==3
        return 0

Then, the compute_xor(a, b) is compute_f(b) ^ compute_f(a-1).

Yes. That's correct.

So the code structure in Python would be:

Read n.

total_xor = 0

for each line in n lines:

    xi, mi = map(int, line.split())

    a = xi

    b = xi + mi -1

    xorr = compute_f(b) ^ compute_f(a-1)

    total_xor ^= xorr

if total_xor !=0:

    print("tolik")

else:

    print("bolik")

That's the plan. Now, handling very large numbers, like 1e16, but in Python that's okay. So even for mi=1e16, a=xi=1e16, mi=1e16, then b=1e16 + 1e16-1 = 2e16-1. But the function compute_f handles that without issues.

Edge Cases:

Let's test the sample inputs.

First sample:

2

2 1 --> a=2, b=2. The XOR is compute_f(2) ^ compute_f(1). 

compute_f(2) is (2%4=2) --> 3. compute_f(1) is 1. So 3 XOR 1 = 2.

Second line: 3 2. a=3, b=3+2-1=4.

XOR from 3 to4: compute_f(4) ^ compute_f(2). compute_f(4) is 4 (4%4=0), compute_f(2) is 3. So 4 XOR3 =7. 

Total XOR is 2 XOR7=5 (binary 010 XOR 111= 101). So 5 !=0 â†’ tolik wins. Which matches the sample.

Second sample:

4 lines, each 1 1. So each a=1, b=1. XOR from 1 to1 is compute_f(1) ^ compute_f(0). compute_f(1)=1, compute_f(0)=0. So each xorr is 1. Total_xor is 1 XOR1 XOR1 XOR1. Let's see: 1 XOR1=0, 0 XOR1=1, 1 XOR1=0. So total is 0 â†’ bolik. Which matches the sample.

Another test case: what if mi=0? But the problem says 1 â‰¤ mi, so no. All mi are at least 1.

What if mi=1, then the sequence is just a single element. So the XOR is a, which is computed as compute_f(a) ^ compute_f(a-1) â†’ which is correct since (0 XOR ... XOR a) XOR (0 XOR ... XOR a-1) = a.

Yes, because 0^1^...^a-1 XOR 0^1^...^a = a.

So the code works.

Now, coding this in Python.

But in Python, when handling very large numbers, the modulus operation is efficient. So no problem.

So the code is straightforward. Let's write it.

The function compute_f can be written as a helper function. But since it's called twice per quarry, and n can be up to 1e5, that's acceptable.

So the code:

Read n.

Initialize total_xor=0.

For each of n lines:

xi, mi = map(int, input().split())

a = xi

b = xi + mi -1

def compute_f(x):

    mod = x %4

    if mod ==0:

        return x

    elif mod ==1:

        return 1

    elif mod ==2:

        return x+1

    else:

        return 0

xor = compute_f(b) ^ compute_f(a-1)

total_xor ^= xor

After all lines:

if total_xor !=0:

    print('tolik')

else:

    print('bolik')

Yes.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    total_xor = 0

    def compute_f(x):
        mod = x % 4
        if mod == 0:
            return x
        elif mod == 1:
            return 1
        elif mod == 2:
            return x + 1
        else:
            return 0

    for _ in range(n):
        xi, mi = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
        a = xi
        b = xi + mi - 1
        xor = compute_f(b) ^ compute_f(a - 1)
        total_xor ^= xor

    print("tolik" if total_xor != 0 else "bolik", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
""",
            "output": \
"""\
bolik
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample:

n=4.

Each line: a=1, mi=1 â†’ b=1. compute_f(1) is 1, compute_f(0) is 0. XOR is 1.

4 times XOR 1: 1^1=0, 0^1=1, 1^1=0. So total_xor=0 â†’ bolik.

Yes.

Another test case: n=1, xi=0, mi=4. Then a=0, mi=4 â†’ b=3. XOR from 0 to3 is 0. So total_xor=0 â†’ bolik. But in the problem statement xi is at least 1, so this case isn't allowed.

So code should handle xi >=1.

The code is correct.

Now, regarding performance: for each of the 1e5 queries, it's O(1) operations. So the code will run in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e5.

The code reads each line, which is manageable. So no issues with time or memory.

Hence, this approach is optimal and correct.
