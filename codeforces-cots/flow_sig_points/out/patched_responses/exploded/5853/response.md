Okay, so I have to find the minimum number of hints needed for Borya to know exactly each card's color and value. Let's think about this problem.

The problem says that Borya knows all the cards he has, but not their order. So the hints must be such that, after applying them, each card's combination of color and value is uniquely determined. The hints are either color hints or value hints. Each hint reveals all the cards of a particular color or value. 

So, the key is that for every pair of cards in Borya's set, after the hints, they must be distinguishable by at least one hint. That is, for any two distinct cards in the collection (even if they are identical), there must be some hint that differentiates them. Wait, but if there are duplicate cards, like two G3s, then those are the same, so maybe they don't need to be differentiated. Wait, the problem says that the hints must make Borya certain of each card's color and value. So for each card in his hand, after the hints, he can determine exactly what its color and value is. The order doesn't matter. 

Wait, but Borya knows the multiset of his cards, but not their order. So the order of the cards is irrelevant. The hints are given, and after the hints, for each card in his hand, there must be a unique possible combination of color and value. So, for example, if two different cards (different in color or value) would be in the same set for all hints given, then Borya can't tell them apart, which is a problem.

So, the approach is: the hints (color and value) that are chosen must create a situation where each card's color and value is uniquely determined by the combination of hints that include it.

Let me rephrase: Each hint (color or value) is a characteristic that a card can have. For each card, after selecting some set of color and value hints, the card's identifiers (the hints it satisfies) must uniquely determine its (color, value) pair.

Wait, maybe not exactly. Because when a color hint is given, the card's color is known if it's in the hint. Similarly for value. So for each card, after the hints, Borya can know which hints (color and value) it satisfies. For example, if a color hint for R is given, then any R card in the hand will be known to have color R. Similarly, if a value hint for 3 is given, any card with value 3 will be known to have that value.

The goal is to choose a set of color and value hints such that for each card in the hand, when considering all color and value hints given, the combination of colors and values revealed uniquely identifies the card's (color, value) pair.

Wait, but how do the hints work? Let's say a color hint is given for R. Then, Borya knows exactly which of his cards are R. Similarly, a value hint for 3 tells him which cards are 3.

But when a card is in a color hint, Borya knows that it has that color. If it's not in any color hint, then he doesn't know the color. Same for value.

So, for each card, the hints give some information. For example, if a card is in a color hint for R, then Borya knows its color is R. If it's not in any color hints, then its color could be any of the colors not selected as hints. Similarly for value.

So, to uniquely determine each card's color and value, each card must be uniquely identified by the set of color hints it's included in and the value hints it's included in. Or, more precisely, the known color and value from the hints must be sufficient to determine the exact (color, value) pair.

Alternatively, for each card (c, v) in the original set, after applying the hints, the card's color must be uniquely determined by the color hints (either it's in exactly one color hint, or the hints for colors that the card is in, plus the absence of others, allow the color to be determined). Similarly for the value. But perhaps the combination of color and value hints must be such that for any two distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) present in the multiset, there is at least one hint (color or value) that distinguishes them.

Wait, maybe that's the case. Suppose two different cards (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) exist in Borya's hand. If after the hints, there's no hint that allows Borya to distinguish between these two cards, then he can't know which is which. So, the hints must be such that for every pair of distinct card types (distinct in c or v or both) present in the multiset, there is at least one hint that differentiates them.

But wait, even if two different card types are present, if the hints given don't allow Borya to tell which is which, then he can't know. So for each pair of distinct card types (a and b), there must be a color or a value hint that allows them to be distinguished. 

So, for example, if a is (R, 3) and b is (G, 3), then a color hint on R or G would allow differentiation. Or a value hint on 3 would not, since both have the same value. Alternatively, if a is (R,3) and b is (R,4), then a value hint on 3 or 4 would help. 

So, the problem reduces to selecting a minimal set of colors and values (hints) such that for every pair of distinct card types present in the multiset, there is at least one hint (color or value) that distinguishes between them.

So the steps would be:

1. Enumerate all possible color and value hints. Each color hint is a subset of {R, G, B, Y, W} (but each hint is a single color, and the player gives that hint once). Similarly for values. The set of hints is a subset of all possible color and value hints. The goal is to find the smallest subset S of these hints such that for any two distinct card types (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) present in the input (i.e., present in the multiset), there is at least one hint in S that differentiates them. 

Wait, but the card types (c, v) present in the input are unique, but the multiset may have duplicates. But in the problem statement, the notes say that in the first sample, two G3 cards are present, and the answer is 0. Because for duplicates, Borya knows the multiset. So, the problem is that even if there are multiple copies of the same (c, v), the hints must ensure that each individual card can be uniquely identified. Wait, but if all cards are the same, then no hints are needed. Because Borya knows that each card is that (c, v). So, the key is that, after the hints, each card's (c, v) must be uniquely determined by the hints it satisfies.

Wait, no. Let's think. Suppose Borya has two cards, both G3. He knows he has two G3s. The order doesn't matter. So when the hints are given, even if zero hints are given, he knows that each card is G3. Because he has exactly two of them. So the answer in that case is zero. Which matches the first sample.

So the problem reduces to the case where the multiset has unique (c, v) pairs. Because if there are duplicates, but all of the same (c, v), then no hints are needed. But if there are two different (c, v) pairs, then hints must be given to distinguish between them.

Wait, but if there are multiple (c, v) pairs, then for each pair of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in the multiset, the hints must ensure that there's a way to differentiate between them. Because Borya knows how many of each (c, v) he has, but the cards are arranged in some order. So, for example, if he has one (R,3) and one (G,3), but there are no hints given, then he can't tell which card is which. So the hints must allow him to determine each card's (c, v) based on the hints.

So, the problem is equivalent to: choose a minimal number of color and value hints such that for every pair of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in the multiset, at least one of the following is true:

- There is a color hint for c1, which would identify the first card as c1, but the second is not in that color (if c2 != c1). Or vice versa: a color hint for c2.

Or:

- There is a value hint for v1, which would identify the first card's value, but the second is not in that value (if v2 != v1). Or a value hint for v2.

Alternatively, another way to look at it: the hints must cover all possible pairs of distinct (c, v) pairs in the input, such that each pair can be distinguished by at least one hint. So for each pair, there must be a hint (color or value) that allows us to tell them apart.

So the problem is similar to a graph problem where each node is a (c, v) pair in the input, and edges represent pairs that are not yet distinguished by any hints. We need to select a minimal set of hints (colors and values) such that all edges are "covered" by at least one hint.

Wait, no. Actually, the pairs that need to be distinguished are all unordered pairs of distinct (c, v) pairs in the input. For each such pair, we need at least one hint that differentiates between them.

So the approach is:

- Collect all unique (c, v) pairs present in the input (since duplicates don't affect the need for hints; if you have two G3s, they don't need to be distinguished from each other, but they may need to be distinguished from other pairs).

- For each pair of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in this set, we need to have at least one hint that distinguishes them. How can a hint do this?

A color hint for a color c can distinguish between (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) if exactly one of c1 or c2 is equal to c. Because then, in that color hint, one card is highlighted, the other is not. So when Borya sees that a card is in this color hint, he knows its color is c, and the other's is not.

Similarly, a value hint for value v can distinguish the pair if exactly one of v1 or v2 is equal to v.

Alternatively, if both (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) are in a color hint, but they have different colors, then the color hints can help distinguish them only if one of the colors is in the hints and the other is not. Wait, no. Because if a color hint is given for c1, then all cards of color c1 are known. So for example, if (c1, v1) is in the color hint (c1), then Borya knows that card's color is c1, and if (c2, v2) is not in any color hint, then its color is unknown, but if c2 is not covered by any color hints, then perhaps the presence in color hints can distinguish.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is that each card's color is known only if exactly one color hint includes it. Or perhaps if a color is present in the hints, then any card with that color will be known. For example, if you have a color hint for R, then any card that is R will be known to be R. But cards that are not R will not be in any color hints (if other color hints are not given). So if a card is not in any color hints, then Borya knows that its color is not among the hinted colors. So the color of the card could be any of the non-hinted colors. Similarly for value.

So, for each card (c, v), the set of color hints it's in (if any) determines its color. For example, if a card is in exactly one color hint (say, R), then Borya knows its color is R. If a card is in no color hints, then Borya knows that its color is among the colors not included in any color hints. Similarly for value.

So, to uniquely determine a card's color, it must be that the set of color hints that include it uniquely identifies its color. Similarly for value.

Wait, maybe not. For example, if there are two color hints: R and G. Suppose a card is in the R color hint. Then Borya knows it's R. If a card is not in any color hints, then it's color is among B, Y, W (assuming those are the other colors). But if another card is also in that set, then they can't be distinguished by color hints alone. So perhaps the key is that for a card's color to be uniquely determined, it must be included in exactly one color hint. Or the combination of color hints and value hints must allow that.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let's think of it in terms of the information provided by each hint. A color hint tells Borya which cards are of that color. So if a card is in a color hint for R, then Borya knows its color is R. If a card is not in any color hints, then Borya knows that its color is not among the colors of any color hints given. So, for example, if the given color hints are R and G, then any card not in those hints must have color B, Y, or W. But if two cards are in that situation, their color could be any of those. So, if a card is not in any color hints, then its color is determined to be in the set of colors not hinted. Similarly for value hints.

So, to uniquely determine a card's color, the set of possible colors (after considering the hints) must be a singleton. For example, if a card is not in any color hints, and the unhinted colors are exactly one color, then the color is known. Or, if the card is in exactly one color hint, then the color is known.

Similarly for value.

Thus, the problem can be approached by considering that for each card (c, v), after the hints, the combination of color hints and value hints must uniquely determine both c and v.

But how do the hints contribute to this? Let's break it down:

A card's color is known if:

Either:

- It is in exactly one color hint (so the color is that hinted color), or

- The set of color hints that it is in (could be none) allows only one possible color.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, if there are no color hints given, then the color could be any of the 5 possible colors. So, unless all other colors are excluded, the color is not determined.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose the input is the third sample: 5 cards, each of different colors (R, G, B, Y, W) and value 1. So all are (X,1). The answer is 4. The note says that you need to give hints about any four colors. Let's see why. If you give hints for four colors, say R, G, B, Y. Then, any card that is in those hints is known to be of that color. The fifth card (W1) is not in any color hint. But since the other four colors are covered, the only remaining color is W. So Borya can deduce that the fifth card is W. So all colors are known. The values are all 1. So no value hints are needed. So the answer is 4 color hints.

So the approach here is that even though the fifth color isn't hinted, by process of elimination, Borya can figure it out. So, the color hints can cover all colors except one, and the remaining color is deduced.

So, in this case, the hints for four colors allow the fifth to be uniquely determined. Thus, for a card that is not in any color hints, if the number of colors not covered by color hints is 1, then the color is known. Similarly for values.

So, the key is that for each card (c, v):

- The set of color hints must be such that either:

   a) The card's color is in a color hint, and all other colors (if any) in the multiset that are possible for this card (based on other hints) are eliminated. Or,

   b) The card's color is not in any color hint, but the possible colors not covered by any color hints are exactly one (so the color is uniquely determined).

Similarly for value hints.

So, to model this, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose a subset of color and value hints such that for each card (c, v):

- If the color is hinted (c is in the color hints), then that's enough to know the color. Or, if the color is not hinted, but the number of possible colors not hinted (i.e., the colors not in any color hint) is exactly one, then the color is known.

Same for value.

Moreover, the combination of color and value information must uniquely identify the card's (c, v).

So, the problem can be viewed as a covering problem where for each pair of distinct card types in the input, there must be a way to distinguish them via the hints. But this is getting a bit abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of hints is determined by the maximum between the number of colors needed to be hinted and the number of values needed, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying all possible subsets of color and value hints, checking if they are sufficient, and choosing the smallest such subset. However, since there are 5 possible colors and 5 possible values, the total number of possible subsets is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, which is manageable. For each possible subset of colors (C) and values (V), we can check if the combination is sufficient. Then, among all valid combinations, pick the one with the smallest size (number of color hints plus number of value hints).

Yes, that's feasible. Because 1024 possibilities is manageable even for n=100.

So the plan is:

1. Collect all unique (c, v) pairs present in the input. Let's call this S.

2. For each possible subset of color hints (C) and value hints (V):

   a. For each (c, v) in S, compute the color information known after the hints C. This is the set of possible colors for this card. If the card's color is in C, then possible colors is {c}. Otherwise, possible colors is the set of colors not in C. If that set has size 1, then possible colors is {c}. Wait, no. For example, if the card's color is W, and the hints are C = {R, G, B, Y}, then the possible colors are {W}, since that's the only color not hinted. So, possible colors is the set of colors not in C, and if the actual color is in that set, then possible colors for that card is the set of colors not in C. But if the set of colors not in C is of size 1, then that's the only possible color for the card.

   Similarly for values.

   So for each card (c, v) in S:

   possible_colors = {c} if c is in C. Else, possible_colors = all colors not in C.

   possible_values = {v} if v is in V. Else, possible_values = all values not in V.

   Then, for the card to be uniquely identified, possible_colors must be a singleton and possible_values must be a singleton. Because the combination of possible_colors and possible_values must uniquely determine (c, v).

Wait, no. Because even if possible_colors is multiple colors, but the combination with possible_values allows only one (c, v) in S, then the card can be uniquely determined.

For example, suppose S has (R,1) and (R,2). If the color hints include R (so possible_colors is {R} for both), and the value hints include 1. Then the first card's possible_values is {1}, the second's possible_values is all not in V (assuming V is {1}). So the first card is (R,1), the second is (R, x where x not in V). If V includes 1, then the second card's possible_values is all values not in V. If that set has multiple values, but in S the only possible (R, v) is (R,2), then possible_values would be {2}, so the second card's value is known.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the pair (possible_colors, possible_values) must uniquely determine the (c, v) of the card. That is, for the card (c, v), the possible_colors must be {c} or possible_colors is a set that, when combined with possible_values (which could be a set), results in a unique (c, v) in S.

But how do we model this?

Perhaps the key is that for each card (c, v) in S, the possible_colors and possible_values after the hints must uniquely identify (c, v) among all elements in S.

So, for each card (c, v), the possible_colors after the hints is:

if c is in C, then {c} (since the color is known).

else, possible_colors = all colors not in C (so the color is not in any color hint, which could be multiple colors).

Similarly for possible_values.

Then, the combination of possible_colors and possible_values must be such that among all elements in S, only (c, v) fits into possible_colors × possible_values.

So, for example, if possible_colors is {R} and possible_values is {1}, then the card is (R,1). If possible_colors is {R, G} and possible_values is {1,2}, then there must be only one (c, v) in S that is in R/G and 1/2.

But how to model that?

Alternatively, for the hints to be sufficient, for every (c, v) in S, when you compute (possible_colors, possible_values) for that card, there must be no other (c', v') in S that can have the same possible_colors and possible_values.

So, for the hints to be valid:

For every pair of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in S:

the possible_colors for (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) must differ, OR the possible_values must differ.

Because if both possible_colors and possible_values are the same, then Borya can't distinguish between the two cards. So, this is the key condition.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of color and value hints such that for all distinct pairs in S, either their possible_colors (based on C) are different, or their possible_values (based on V) are different.

So, the approach is:

Generate all possible subsets of C (color hints) and V (value hints). For each combination (C, V), compute for each (c, v) in S their possible_colors and possible_values. Then, check if all pairs of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in S have either possible_colors different (i.e., possible_colors(c1, C) != possible_colors(c2, C)) OR possible_values different (possible_values(v1, V) != possible_values(v2, V)).

If that is the case, then this (C, V) is a valid solution. We need to find the combination (C, V) with the smallest size (|C| + |V|).

This seems manageable, as the number of possible C and V combinations is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, which is feasible to check.

So, the steps for the code:

1. Read the input and collect all unique (c, v) pairs. Let's call this unique_cards.

2. If there is only one unique card, then the answer is 0. Because Borya knows all cards are the same, so no hints needed.

3. Otherwise, generate all possible combinations of color hints (C) and value hints (V). For each combination, check if it is valid.

4. For each valid combination, compute |C| + |V|. Keep track of the minimum.

Now, how to implement this efficiently?

First, for each possible subset of colors (C) and values (V), for each (c, v) in unique_cards:

possible_colors(c, C) is {c} if c is in C, else it's the set of colors not in C.

possible_values(v, V) is {v} if v is in V, else it's the set of values not in V.

But when comparing possible_colors between two cards (c1 and c2), the possible_colors can be represented as:

For possible_colors, if c1 is in C, then possible_colors is a singleton {c1}. Otherwise, it's the set of colors not in C. Similarly for c2.

So, possible_colors for c1 and c2 are different if:

Either:

- c1 is in C and c2 is not in C (possible_colors is {c1} vs. non-singleton).

- c2 is in C and c1 is not in C.

- Both are not in C. Then possible_colors for both is the same set (the colors not in C), so possible_colors is the same.

Wait, no. Because for any card not in C, possible_colors is the same set: all colors not in C. So, for two cards c1 and c2 not in C, their possible_colors are the same. So possible_colors(c1, C) equals possible_colors(c2, C) if neither is in C.

Similarly for possible_values.

So, the possible_colors of two cards (c1, c2) are different if and only if:

At least one of c1 or c2 is in C.

If both are in C, then possible_colors are {c1} and {c2}, which are different if c1 != c2.

If only one is in C, then possible_colors are singleton vs non-singleton (so different).

So, possible_colors for two cards (c1, c2) in S are different if and only if:

Either c1 is in C and c2 is not, or c2 is in C and c1 is not, or both are in C and c1 != c2.

Similarly for possible_values.

So, for a pair (c1, v1) and (c2, v2), the possible_colors are different if:

(c1 is in C) XOR (c2 is in C), OR (c1 and c2 are in C and c1 != c2).

Similarly for possible_values.

So, the condition for the pair to be distinguishable is:

Either possible_colors are different (based on C), or possible_values are different (based on V).

So, for each pair (x, y) in unique_cards where x != y, the pair must satisfy:

Either:

- (x.c is in C) XOR (y.c is in C), or (x.c and y.c are in C and x.c != y.c) 

OR 

- (x.v is in V) XOR (y.v is in V), or (x.v and y.v are in V and x.v != y.v)

If this is true for all pairs, then (C, V) is a valid combination.

So, the code can proceed as follows:

For all possible subsets C of colors (each C is a set of colors to hint), and subsets V of values (each V is a set of values to hint):

   For each pair of distinct (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in unique_cards:

      Check if (c1 in C XOR c2 in C) OR (c1 and c2 in C and c1 != c2) → colors differ.

      Check if (v1 in V XOR v2 in V) OR (v1 and v2 in V and v1 != v2) → values differ.

      If either of these is true → the pair is distinguishable.

      If for any pair, neither is true → combination is invalid.

   If all pairs are distinguishable → compute |C| + |V|, track the minimum.

So, the code can iterate over all possible C (from 0 to 31, representing the 5 colors) and V (0 to 31, representing the 5 values). For each combination, check if all pairs are distinguishable as per the above condition.

But how to represent the colors and values as bitsets?

For example, colors can be represented as a bitmask, where each bit corresponds to a color. Similarly for values.

But since the actual colors are R, G, B, Y, W, we can map them to 0-4, and values 1-5 can be mapped to 0-4 as well.

So, for each possible subset of colors (C), represented as a bitmask of 5 bits, and each subset of values (V), represented as a bitmask of 5 bits:

Check for each pair of cards (c1, v1) and (c2, v2) in unique_cards:

   If (c1 in C) XOR (c2 in C) → colors are different → proceed.

   Else, if (c1 and c2 are in C and c1 != c2) → colors are different → proceed.

   Else → check the values.

   For values, similarly:

   If (v1 in V) XOR (v2 in V) → values are different → proceed.

   Else, if (v1 and v2 are in V and v1 != v2) → values are different → proceed.

   Else → the pair is not distinguishable → invalid.

So, the code can proceed with this logic.

Now, the code can be structured as follows:

Read n.

Read the next line, split into cards.

Create a set of unique cards.

If len(unique_cards) == 1: output 0.

Else:

Generate all possible combinations of C and V.

For each combination:

   valid = True

   For each pair (a, b) in unique_cards where a != b:

      Check if colors can distinguish them.

      If not, check values.

      If neither can distinguish, then combination is invalid.

   If valid, compute the cost (number of bits set in C + number of bits set in V).

Track the minimal cost.

Now, how to generate all possible C and V?

For colors: 5 bits, each can be 0 or 1. So 32 possibilities (0-31). Similarly for values.

So, in Python, for each color_mask in 0..31:

   C_colors = [ (mask & (1 << i)) != 0 for i in 0-4 ]

Wait, perhaps better to represent the colors and values as sets. For example, for a color_mask, C is the set of colors where the bit is set.

Same for value_mask.

So, for example, color_mask = 0 → no colors hinted. color_mask = 1 (binary 00001) → first color (say R) is hinted.

But how to map the actual color letters and values to their bits?

We can assign each color to a bit in the color_mask. For example:

colors = {'R':0, 'G':1, 'B':2, 'Y':3, 'W':4}

values = {'1':0, '2':1, '3':2, '4':3, '5':4}

So, for a card (c, v), c is mapped to 0-4, v to 0-4.

Then, for a color_mask, a color c is considered to be in C if the bit at position colors[c] is set.

Similarly for value_mask.

So, in code:

unique_cards = set of tuples (c, v). For each (c, v), convert to (color_code, value_code).

Then, for each possible color_mask in 0 to 31, and value_mask in 0 to 31:

   For each pair (a, b) in unique_cards:

      a_c, a_v = a

      b_c, b_v = b

      color_a_in = (color_mask & (1 << a_c)) != 0

      color_b_in = (color_mask & (1 << b_c)) != 0

      color_diff = (color_a_in != color_b_in) or (color_a_in and color_b_in and a_c != b_c)

      value_a_in = (value_mask & (1 << a_v)) != 0

      value_b_in = (value_mask & (1 << b_v)) != 0

      value_diff = (value_a_in != value_b_in) or (value_a_in and value_b_in and a_v != b_v)

      if not (color_diff or value_diff):

          valid = False

          break

   if valid:

       cost = bin(color_mask).count('1') + bin(value_mask).count('1')

       track min_cost.

So, the code can generate all possible color and value masks, and for each pair of cards, check if they are distinguishable.

Now, for the third sample input:

5
B1 Y1 W1 G1 R1 → unique_cards is 5 entries, each with different color and same value (1).

So, for each pair, the colors are different. So, to distinguish between them, either the color hints must distinguish them, or the value hints.

But since all have the same value, value hints can't distinguish them. So the value hints are irrelevant here.

So the color hints must be chosen such that all pairs of colors are distinguished by the hints. How?

For each pair of colors (like B and Y), the hints must have at least one of them in the hints, so that their possible_colors are different.

Alternatively, if one is in C and the other is not.

But how to cover all possible pairs of colors in S?

For example, the third sample has colors B, Y, W, G, R.

Each pair of colors must be distinguished by the color hints. For example, consider B and Y. If exactly one of them is in C, then they are distinguished. If both are in C, then they are distinguished if they are different.

But since all colors are in S, all pairs need to be distinguished.

So for all possible pairs (c1, c2), the color hints must ensure that either c1 is in C XOR c2 is in C, or both are in C and c1 != c2.

Wait, but if both are in C, then possible_colors for each is their own color. So if c1 and c2 are different, then their possible_colors are different. So, if all colors are in C, then all pairs are distinguished.

But that's not the minimal. For example, in the third sample, the answer is 4. Let's see:

If C is {B, Y, W, G} (4 colors), then R is not in C. For the pair (B, R), B is in C, R is not. So colors differ. For pairs within C (like B and Y), since both are in C, possible_colors are {B} and {Y}, which differ. For R (not in C), possible_colors is {R} (since the other colors are in C, so the remaining colors not in C is {R}).

So all pairs are distinguishable. So the cost is 4 + 0 (since value_mask can be 0) → total 4.

So, the code should find that color_mask 0b11110 (assuming R is the 0th bit?), but wait, in the mapping, perhaps R is the 0th bit. Let's see:

Suppose the colors are mapped as R:0, G:1, B:2, Y:3, W:4.

So, the mask 0b11110 (binary 30 in decimal) corresponds to bits 1, 2, 3, 4 (G, B, Y, W). So the colors in C are G, B, Y, W. The R is not in C.

So for R and any other color (like G):

G is in C. R is not. So colors differ → pair is distinguishable.

For R and W:

W is in C. R is not → colors differ.

For two colors in C, like G and B: both are in C and different → colors differ.

So, all pairs are covered.

So, the color_mask is 30 (binary 11110) → 4 bits set. value_mask is 0 (no value hints). So total cost is 4 + 0 = 4.

Which is the correct answer.

Thus, the code's logic would correctly find this combination.

Now, for the code:

First, process the input, collect unique cards.

Then, for all possible color_mask and value_mask:

Check for each pair of cards whether they are distinguishable.

The code must iterate through all possible pairs of cards.

Now, the code in Python:

But how to generate all possible pairs of unique_cards? Since unique_cards is a set, we can convert it to a list and generate all possible combinations.

But for a list of length m, there are m*(m-1)/2 pairs.

For m up to 25 (since there are 25 possible unique cards), this is manageable.

Now, the code steps:

Read n.

cards = list(input().split())

unique_cards = set(cards)

if len(unique_cards) == 1:

    print(0)

else:

    # Preprocess the unique_cards into color and value codes.

    color_map = {'R':0, 'G':1, 'B':2, 'Y':3, 'W':4}

    value_map = {'1':0, '2':1, '3':2, '4':3, '5':4}

    processed = []

    for card in unique_cards:

        c, v = card[0], card[1]

        processed.append( (color_map[c], value_map[v]) )

    min_hints = float('inf')

    # Iterate all possible color_masks (0-31) and value_masks (0-31)

    for color_mask in range(32):

        for value_mask in range(32):

            valid = True

            # Check all pairs of cards

            for i in range(len(processed)):

                a_c, a_v = processed[i]

                for j in range(i+1, len(processed)):

                    b_c, b_v = processed[j]

                    # Check color distinction

                    color_a_in = (color_mask & (1 << a_c)) != 0

                    color_b_in = (color_mask & (1 << b_c)) != 0

                    color_diff = (color_a_in != color_b_in) or (color_a_in and color_b_in and (a_c != b_c))

                    # Check value distinction

                    value_a_in = (value_mask & (1 << a_v)) != 0

                    value_b_in = (value_mask & (1 << b_v)) != 0

                    value_diff = (value_a_in != value_b_in) or (value_a_in and value_b_in and (a_v != b_v))

                    if not (color_diff or value_diff):

                        valid = False

                        break

                if not valid:

                    break

            if valid:

                current_cost = bin(color_mask).count('1') + bin(value_mask).count('1')

                if current_cost < min_hints:

                    min_hints = current_cost

    print(min_hints)

Wait, but this has a nested loop for pairs. For example, for each color_mask and value_mask, for each pair (i, j) in processed, check the condition.

But in the code above, for each i in 0..m-1, and j in i+1..m-1, check if the pair (i,j) is valid.

But the code as written has a loop for i in range(len(processed)), then for j in range(i+1, len(processed)), but the code above has a loop for j in range(i+1, len(processed)), which is correct.

But the code inside the loops for i and j is:

a_c, a_v = processed[i]

b_c, b_v = processed[j]

Check if (color_diff or value_diff). If not, mark as invalid.

So, the code checks all pairs once.

Now, the code should work.

Testing it against the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

2

G3 G3

unique_cards has one element. So output is 0. Correct.

Sample 2:

Input:

4

G4 R4 R3 B3

unique_cards is G4, R4, R3, B3.

The code will generate color_mask and value_mask pairs.

The optimal solution is to give color hint on R and value hints on 4 and 3. Or perhaps another combination. But the sample output is 2.

Wait, the sample output is 2. Let's see:

Possible solution: color hints on R and B. Then, for R4 and R3:

Since R is in the color hints, possible_colors for R4 is R, R3 is R. But values need to be distinguished. So value hints on 3 and 4. That would cost 2 + 2 = 4. But the sample output is 2.

Wait, the correct solution is to give a color hint on R and a value hint on 4. So total hints 2.

So for the pairs:

G4 and R4: G4 is not in the color hint R. So possible_colors: R is in C. G4's color is not in C (since C is {R} in this case), so possible_colors is {G, B, Y, W} (but according to the card, G4's color is G). But wait, in the code's logic, for a card not in C, possible_colors is the set of colors not in C. So in this case, possible_colors for G4 is {G, B, Y, W} (since C is {R}).

Similarly for R4: in C, possible_colors is {R}.

So possible_colors for G4 and R4 are different. So the pair is distinguishable by color.

Similarly, R4 and R3: R is in C. So possible_colors for both is {R}. So color is same. But value hints on 4. R4's value is 4, which is in V (value_mask). R3's value is 3, not in V. So possible_values for R4 is {4}, R3 is possible_values is all values not in V (which is {3} if V is {4}).

So possible_values are {4} and {3}, which are different. So the pair is distinguishable.

Similarly, R3 and B3: R3 is in C (R), B3 is not in C. So possible_colors different.

So all pairs are covered with color_mask {R} and value_mask {4}, which is 1+1=2.

So the code should find that combination.

So the code would check color_mask 0b10 (binary for R being the second bit? Wait, no, the mapping of R is 0, so 0b1 (binary 1) is color_mask for R. Then, value_mask for 4 is 0b1000 (binary 8), since value 4 is mapped to 3 (as per the value_map: '4' is 3, so 1 << 3 is 8).

So color_mask is 1 (binary 00001), value_mask is 8 (binary 1000).

Then the cost is 1+1 = 2.

Thus, the code would find this combination.

So the code works for this case.

Sample 3:

Input:

5

B1 Y1 W1 G1 R1 → unique_cards has 5 elements.

The code would find that the minimal cost is 4, as explained.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

Now, considering the code's performance:

For each color_mask (32) and value_mask (32), and for each pair of cards (up to (25 choose 2) = 300 pairs), the code checks the condition.

So 32 * 32 = 1024 combinations, each with up to 300 pairs → 1024 * 300 = 307,200 operations. Which is acceptable.

So the code should work within the time constraints.

Thus, the code should be correct.
