Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The problem is about counting the number of pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j, such that f(a_i) equals f(a_j). The function f is defined recursively. Let's understand what f(x) does.

Looking at the function definition:

f(0) = 0.

For even numbers: f(2x) = f(x). So when x is even, it's the same as f of half x.

For odd numbers: f(2x + 1) = f(x) + 1. So when x is odd, it's the same as f of (x-1)/2 plus one.

Wait, maybe this function is counting the number of 1s in the binary representation of x. Let's test some examples.

Let's compute f(1). Since 1 is 2*0 + 1. So f(1) = f(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Binary of 1 is 1, which has one 1.

f(2) is even. 2x where x=1. So f(2) = f(1) = 1. Binary of 2 is 10, which has one 1. Hmm, same as count.

Wait, f(3) would be 2x+1 where x=1. So f(3) = f(1) +1 = 1+1=2. Binary of 3 is 11, two 1s. Yep. So it's the count of 1s in binary. So f(x) is the number of 1s in the binary representation of x. Because every time you have an even number, you divide by 2 (right shift), and the number of 1s remains. When it's odd, you add 1 to the count (since the least significant bit is 1) and then process the remaining bits by dividing by 2 (right shift after subtracting 1).

So the problem reduces to: for each a_i, compute the number of 1s in its binary representation. Then count how many pairs of elements have the same count.

So the approach is:

1. For each number in the input array, compute the count of 1s in its binary representation.
2. Use a frequency map to track how many times each count occurs.
3. For each frequency, calculate the number of pairs possible, which is combination(freq, 2) = freq * (freq - 1) / 2.
4. Sum all these combinations to get the total number of valid pairs.

Now, the key steps are:

- Efficiently compute the count of 1s for each a_i.
- Efficiently manage the frequencies, considering that n can be up to 1e5, and a_i up to 1e9.

So the first thing is to compute the number of 1 bits for each a_i. How to do that efficiently?

In Python, the built-in function bin(x).count('1') gives exactly the number of 1s in the binary representation. Since a_i can be up to 1e9, but converting it to a binary string and counting is O(number of bits) which is O(32) for 32-bit numbers (since 1e9 is about 30 bits). So for 1e5 numbers, this is manageable.

Alternatively, we can compute it manually using bitwise operations, but using the built-in method is probably the simplest and efficient enough.

Once we have all the counts, we can use a dictionary to track the frequency of each count. Then, for each frequency value in the dictionary, compute the number of pairs and sum them up.

The next step is handling the frequencies. For example, if a count occurs k times, the number of pairs is k*(k-1)/2. Because each pair (i,j) where i<j and both have the same count contributes to the total.

So, the plan is:

Read n.

Read the list of a_i.

For each a_i, compute count of 1s in binary.

Create a frequency dictionary: counts.

For each count in the list, increment counts[count] by 1.

Then, iterate through all the values in counts, compute for each the combination, and sum all.

Edge Cases:

- n is 1: no pairs possible. So output is 0.

Now, considering that n is up to 1e5, and each a_i up to 1e9, the code must process this efficiently.

In Python, using a defaultdict or a regular dictionary to track frequencies is O(n) time. Then, for each frequency, the calculation is O(1) per frequency. The total time is acceptable.

Testing the examples:

First example:

Input:
3
1 2 4

Compute their binary counts:

1 is 1 â†’ 1.

2 is 10 â†’ 1.

4 is 100 â†’ 1.

So counts are {1:3}. The number of pairs is 3*2/2 = 3. Which matches the output.

Second example:

3

5,3,1.

5 in binary is 101 â†’ 2 ones.

3 is 11 â†’ 2 ones.

1 is 1 â†’ 1.

So counts are {2:2, 1:1}. The pairs are (5,3) â†’ 2*1/2 =1. So output is 1.

Yes.

So the code should work.

Now, let's code this.

In Python, the steps are:

Read n.

Read the next line as list of integers.

For each number in the list, compute the count of 1s.

Use a dictionary to track frequencies.

Then, sum over all frequencies the value of (f * (f-1)) // 2.

Now, code:

Read n. Then list_a = list(map(int, input().split())).

Then, for each x in list_a, compute bin(x).count('1').

Count the frequencies.

Compute the sum.

So the code could look like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    a = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    from collections import defaultdict
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        c = bin(num).count('1')
        counts[c] += 1
    total = 0
    for v in counts.values():
        total += v * (v-1) // 2
    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3
5 3 1
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample: a is 5,3,1. counts are 2 (twice, 5 and 3) and 1 (once). So 2*1//2=1. Correct.

This code is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=1e5.

The memory is also O(n), but in Python, for 1e5 elements, it's manageable.

Yes, this should be the optimal solution. Because the time to compute each count is O(1) (since the binary length is fixed for 64-bit numbers), and the rest is O(n) time.

So the code is correct.

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
from collections import defaultdict

counts = defaultdict(int)
for num in a:
    counts[bin(num).count('1')] += 1

total = 0
for v in counts.values():
    total += v * (v - 1) // 2

print(total)
```
