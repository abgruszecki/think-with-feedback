Okay, I need to solve this problem where Max and Lucas are playing a game on a DAG, and I have to determine for all possible starting positions (i,j) whether Max will win if both play optimally. The key here is to model the game states and determine the Grundy numbers or use some kind of game theory dynamic programming approach.

First, let's understand the game rules. Players alternate turns, starting with Max. Each turn, the current player moves their marble along an edge. The sequence of characters chosen in each round (regardless of whose turn) must be non-decreasing in ASCII values. So the first move can be any character, but each subsequent move must have a character >= the previous one. The player who can't move loses.

Hmm, so the moves are dependent on the history of the characters chosen. This complicates things because game states typically depend only on current positions and some state related to the previous moves. Since the constraint is that each new character must be >= the last, the state needs to track the last character used. That's probably the crucial part here.

The problem is similar to a game where the available moves depend on a certain parameter (the last character). This suggests that for each state (position of Max's marble, position of Lucas's marble, last character), there's a certain outcome. But since the players are moving their own marbles, maybe we need to model the state as (max_pos, lucas_pos, last_char, turn). But that might get too complicated, especially considering the n is up to 100, and the characters can be 26 letters. So the state space could be 100 * 100 * 26 * 2, which is manageable.

Wait, but the turns are part of the state. Let's think: the game alternates between Max and Lucas. Each round is a turn (Max in round 1, Lucas in round 2, etc.), and each move in their turn must choose a character >= the previous. So the last character used is part of the state, and the current player's turn. But perhaps the state can be represented as (max_pos, lucas_pos, last_char), and whether it's Max's turn or Lucas's. Wait, no. Because the players alternate turns, but the sequence of characters is built over all rounds. So regardless of who moves, each move must have a character >= the previous. For example:

Round 1 (Max's turn): she moves, chooses character c1.

Round 2 (Lucas's turn): he moves, chooses c2 >= c1.

Round 3 (Max's turn): she must choose c3 >= c2.

And so on.

So the key is that each move is constrained by the last character chosen, regardless of which player made that move. So the 'last_char' is part of the game's state, and the turn (whether it's Max or Lucas's turn) also determines whose move it is.

So the state for the game can be represented as (i, j, last_char, turn). Wait, but maybe the 'last_char' is the last character used in the sequence of moves. For the initial move, there's no previous character, so Max can choose any possible edge. Then Lucas must choose a character >= that, etc.

Wait, the first move (round 1) can have any character. Then the next move (round 2) must have a character >= c1. Then round 3 must have >= c2, and so on. So the 'last_char' is the maximum of all previous characters? No, no. Each subsequent move must be >= the immediately previous move. So the sequence c1, c2, c3, ... must be non-decreasing. So for the third move, the character must be >= c2, which was the previous character.

So the state after each move must track the last character chosen. So for each possible game state, we need to track:

- The positions of both marbles (i, j) where i is Max's current position, j is Lucas's.

- The last character used in the previous move (or None for the first move).

- Whose turn it is to move next.

But wait, the turn alternates. So the initial state is (i, j, None), and it's Max's turn. Then, after she moves, the state transitions to (new_i, j, c, Lucas's turn), and the next move must have a character >= c. Then Lucas's turn: he moves his marble, and the next character must be >= c.

Wait, but the marbles are separate. So each player moves their own marble. So in Max's turn, she moves her marble from i to some new position via an edge with a character >= last_char (if there's a last_char). Similarly for Lucas.

Wait, no. The problem statement says that the rounds are numbered for both players. So Max's moves are in odd-numbered rounds (1,3,5,...) and Lucas's in even (2,4,6,...). The sequence of characters from all moves (both players) must form a non-decreasing sequence. So the first move (Max's) can choose any character. The second move (Lucas's) must choose a character >= the first. The third move (Max's) must choose a character >= the second. And so on.

So the order of the moves is:

1. Max moves, picks c1.

2. Lucas moves, picks c2 >= c1.

3. Max moves, picks c3 >= c2.

4. Lucas moves, picks c4 >= c3.

etc.

So after each move, the last character is the one chosen in the previous move, regardless of which player made it.

Therefore, the state that determines the available options is the last character used. So, for any state, the next move must have a character >= the last character. The players take turns, but the last character is part of the state, and the current player's turn is part of the state as well.

Therefore, the game can be modeled with the following state variables:

- The positions of Max's and Lucas's marbles (i, j).

- The last character used (c), which could be None for the initial state.

- The current player's turn (which alternates after each move).

But this seems a bit complex. How can we model all these possibilities efficiently?

An alternative approach is to realize that the outcome of the game (whether the current player can force a win) depends on the current positions (i, j), the last character c, and whether it's Max's turn or Lucas's. We can model this with memoization or dynamic programming.

But with n up to 100, and 26 possible letters, plus two players, the state space is 100 * 100 * 27 * 2 = 540,000. Which is manageable.

Wait, the letters are lowercase English letters, so 26 possible. The last character can be None (for the first move), which adds one more possibility, making 27. So the state is (i, j, last_char, turn). For each state, we can precompute whether the current player can win.

But how to model the transitions?

Let's think recursively. For a given state (i, j, c_prev, turn), the current player must choose a move (their own marble's edge) such that the character on the edge is >= c_prev (if c_prev is not None). Then, the next state will be (new_i, j, new_c, other_turn) if it's Max's turn (she moves her marble), or (i, new_j, new_c, other_turn) if it's Lucas's turn.

The current player can win if there exists at least one move that leads to a state where the opponent cannot win. So this is a standard minimax approach.

The base case is when the current player cannot make any move (i.e., no outgoing edges from their current position that satisfy the character constraint). In this case, the current player loses.

So the approach is to memoize all possible states and determine if the current player can win.

But with n=100 and m up to n(n-1)/2, the number of possible transitions could be manageable. However, the memoization might be time-consuming. So we need to find an efficient way to compute this.

But perhaps we can precompute for all possible states. Let's structure the problem as follows.

For each possible state (i, j, c_prev, turn), determine if the current player can win. We can memoize this as a 4-dimensional DP array. However, given that 100*100*27*2 is about 540,000 states, and for each state we might have to check up to the number of outgoing edges for the current player's position, this might be feasible.

But wait, when it's Max's turn, she can only move her own marble, so the transitions are based on Max's possible moves. Similarly for Lucas's turn.

So, for Max's turn (turn 0, say), she is at position i. She must move along an edge from i to k with character c >= c_prev. The next state will be (k, j, c, Lucas's turn). For each possible such move, if any of the resulting states is a losing state for the opponent (Lucas), then the current state is a winning state.

Similarly for Lucas's turn: he is at position j. He must move along an edge from j to k with character c >= c_prev. The next state is (i, k, c, Max's turn). If any of these transitions leads to a state where the opponent (Max) can't win, then Lucas can win here.

So the DP can be structured as follows:

memo[i][j][c_prev][turn] = True if current player can force a win.

We need to precompute this for all possible i, j, c_prev (including None), and turn (Max or Lucas).

The problem is how to order the computation. Since the graph is a DAG, perhaps we can process the nodes in topological order. However, the state depends on both i and j, and the characters, which complicates the ordering.

Alternatively, since the transitions can lead to any state, regardless of topological order, but in a DAG, the game can't loop forever (since each move progresses along the edges, which have no cycles). So the game must terminate after a finite number of steps. Therefore, the DP can be computed using memoization with recursion and memo tables.

But recursive memoization might be too slow for Python with n=100. So perhaps an iterative approach is better, using memoization in a bottom-up way.

Alternatively, memoization with memo tables using memoization via dictionaries or arrays. Since the number of states is manageable, we can precompute all possibilities.

Let's outline the steps.

1. Preprocess the edges for each node, sorted by character. For each node, have a list of outgoing edges, sorted by character. But perhaps the order doesn't matter as long as we check all possible edges >= c_prev.

2. For each possible state (i, j, c_prev, turn), compute whether the current player can win.

We can model the state as follows:

- c_prev can be represented as a number, with 0 representing None (the initial state), and 1-26 for 'a'-'z'.

Wait, but in Python, using a character like None and 'a'-'z' can be handled, but perhaps it's easier to map them to integers. Let's see.

The initial state has c_prev as None, which can be represented as a special value. Then for the transitions, when a player chooses a character c, that becomes the new c_prev for the next move.

So for the DP, we can represent c_prev as an integer from 0 to 26, where 0 is the initial state (no previous character), and 1-26 correspond to 'a' (97) to 'z' (122). Wait, but the actual ASCII value of 'a' is 97, but we can map 'a' to 1, 'b' to 2, etc., to save space. So for any character c, its mapped value is ord(c) - ord('a') + 1. So 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.

So for a given c_prev (could be 0, or 1-26), the next move must have a character >= c_prev. For example, if c_prev is 0 (initial state), the next character can be any (since there's no previous). If c_prev is 5 (which is 'e'), the next character must be >= 'e', which is mapped to 5.

So the steps for the DP:

For each state (i, j, c_prev, turn):

- If turn is Max's (turn 0):

   She can move her marble (i) along any edge (i → k) with c >= c_prev (if c_prev is 0, then any c is allowed).

   For each possible move (k, c):

      new_c_prev = c

      next turn is Lucas's (turn 1)

      If the resulting state (k, j, new_c_prev, 1) is a losing state for Lucas, then current state is a win for Max.

   So if any such move exists, the current state is a winning state.

- If turn is Lucas's (turn 1):

   He can move his marble (j) along any edge (j → k) with c >= c_prev.

   For each possible move (k, c):

      new_c_prev = c

      next turn is Max's (turn 0)

      If the resulting state (i, k, new_c_prev, 0) is a losing state for Max, then current state is a win for Lucas.

   So if any such move exists, the current state is a winning state.

If no such moves exist, then the current player cannot move and loses, so the state is losing.

So the problem reduces to computing this DP table for all possible (i, j, c_prev, turn).

Once the DP table is computed, for each initial state (i, j), the starting state is (i, j, 0, 0) (since Max starts first, and the initial c_prev is 0). The outcome of the game is determined by whether this state is a winning state for the starting player (Max). So if the initial state is a winning state, then Max can win (output 'A'), else 'B'.

Now, the challenge is to compute the DP table efficiently.

But how to model the DP. Since the state depends on i, j, c_prev, and turn, and for each state, the computation depends on transitions to other states.

Given that the graph is a DAG, perhaps we can process the states in reverse topological order, but since the states involve combinations of i and j, and the transitions can go to any nodes, this may not be straightforward.

An alternative approach is memoization with memoization tables. We can precompute the DP using memoization with memo tables. However, since Python's recursion depth is limited, a recursive approach might hit stack limits. So an iterative approach using memoization is better.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each node, the outgoing edges grouped by their character. For example, for node v, have a list of edges sorted by character. But perhaps we can group all edges for a node and sort them for easier access.

Wait, but for a given node v and a minimum character c_prev, we need to find all edges from v where the character is >= c_prev. To efficiently find these edges, perhaps for each node v, we can have a sorted list of characters in ascending order, and for each character, have the list of edges. Then, given a c_prev, we can binary search to find the first edge with character >= c_prev, and iterate all from there.

But how to handle this?

Alternatively, for each node v, pre-sort the edges in increasing order of their characters. Then, for a given c_prev (integer), we can use bisect to find the starting index where the character is >= c_prev. Then, all edges from that index onwards are valid.

So first, for each node v, we sort the edges by the character in ascending order, and for each, store the character's mapped value (1-26). Then, for a given c_prev (0 is allowed, which is equivalent to any character allowed), we can compute the minimum mapped character allowed. For example, if c_prev is 0, then any character is allowed (since it's the first move). Otherwise, the next character must be >= c_prev.

Wait, for c_prev 0 (initial state), the next character can be any. For other c_prev values (1-26), the next character must be >= c_prev.

So for a node's edges, when the previous character is c_prev (could be 0 or 1-26), the allowed edges are those with character >= c_prev (if c_prev is not 0). If c_prev is 0, all edges are allowed.

Wait, no: when c_prev is 0 (initial state), the first move can choose any character. So the allowed edges for the first move (Max's turn) are all edges from her current position. So, for Max's first move, she can choose any edge from her current node i. The character is then the new c_prev for Lucas's turn.

So the preprocessing steps:

For each node v, pre-sort its outgoing edges by the character's mapped value (1-26). Then, for a given c_prev (0 or 1-26), the allowed edges are those with character >= c_prev (if c_prev is not 0), or all edges (if c_prev is 0).

Wait, no: c_prev can be 0 only in the initial state. So when the current state has c_prev 0, it's the first move, and any character is allowed. But for other states, c_prev is 1-26, and the next move must have character >= that.

So for any node v and c_prev, the allowed edges are:

if c_prev == 0: all edges of v.

else: edges of v with character >= c_prev (in their mapped value).

So for each node, we can sort the edges in ascending order of mapped character. Then, for a given c_prev, we can perform a binary search to find the first edge with character >= c_prev. For example, if the edges are sorted, and the characters are [1, 3, 5], and c_prev is 3, then the allowed edges are 3,5.

So for the node, the edges are sorted, and for a given c_prev (including 0), we can get all edges >= c_prev.

Now, for each node v, we can precompute a list of edges sorted by their mapped characters, along with the target nodes.

This preprocessing will allow us to quickly find the allowed edges for a given node and c_prev.

Once this is done, the DP can be computed as follows:

We can model the DP as a memoization table. For each state (i, j, c_prev, turn), we need to determine if the current player can win.

We can represent the state as:

- i: Max's current position.

- j: Lucas's current position.

- c_prev: the previous character's mapped value (0 for initial).

- turn: 0 for Max's turn, 1 for Lucas's turn.

The memo table can be a 4-dimensional array: dp[i][j][c_prev][turn], which is True if the current player can win, False otherwise.

The base case is when the current player can't make any move. In that case, the current player loses.

So, the steps to compute the DP:

Initialize all dp[i][j][cp][t] to False.

Then, for each state (i, j, cp, t) in some order (possibly reversed topological order?), compute whether the current player can win by checking all possible moves.

But given the dependencies between the states, how to order the processing? For example, the state (i,j,cp,t) may depend on other states (k,j, new_cp, 1-t) when t is 0.

This suggests that the states should be processed in reverse topological order. However, since the graph is a DAG, but the state depends on i and j, which could be any nodes, perhaps the order is not straightforward.

Alternatively, we can compute the DP using memoization with memo tables, using memoization in a dynamic programming approach. Since the game is a finite state and each transition leads to a state with a higher or equal c_prev (since each move's character is >= previous), perhaps the c_prev can be ordered, and we can process the states in order of decreasing c_prev.

But how?

Wait, the c_prev can only increase or stay the same with each move. Because each move's character must be >= the previous. So the sequence of c_prev values is non-decreasing. Therefore, when processing the DP states, for a given c_prev, the next move's c_prev must be >= the current one. So higher c_prev values are processed after lower ones.

Wait, no. The c_prev can increase each time. So in the DP, when processing a state with c_prev = k, the next states will have c_prev >=k. Therefore, if we process the states in reverse order of c_prev (from highest to lowest), then when processing a state (i,j,cp, t), the transitions to higher c_prev values would have already been computed.

So the order could be:

Process all states in order of c_prev from highest to 0. For each c_prev in 26, 25, ..., 0:

   For all i, j (from 1 to n), for both turns (0 and 1):

      compute dp[i][j][cp][t] based on the possible transitions.

But why does this work?

Because when cp is high, the next transitions can only have higher or equal cp. But since we process from high to low, the next transitions for higher cp have already been processed.

Wait, for example, if we have a state (i,j, cp=5, t=0). The possible transitions are Max's moves with characters >=5. The next c_prev will be >=5. So when processing cp=5, the next states will have higher or equal cp, which have already been processed (since we are going from high to low). Therefore, the values for those next states are already known.

Yes, that makes sense. So the order of processing is crucial. We can process the c_prev in decreasing order (from 26 down to 0). For each c_prev, process all possible i, j, and turn.

This way, when computing dp[i][j][cp][t], all possible transitions (which require higher or equal cp) have already been computed.

So the steps:

1. Preprocess all edges for each node, sorted by mapped character (ascending).

2. For each node v, create a list of edges sorted by their mapped character. For each edge, store the target node and the mapped character.

3. For each node v, create a list of sorted mapped characters, so that we can binary search for the first edge >= a given cp.

4. Initialize the dp table with all False.

5. Process c_prev from 26 down to 0:

   a. For each i from 1 to n:

      b. For each j from 1 to n:

         c. For each turn (0 and 1):

            i. If it's Max's turn (turn 0):

               - Check all edges from i where the character >= cp (if cp !=0) or all edges (if cp ==0).

               - For each such edge (to k, with c):

                  - The next state is (k, j, c, 1).

                  - If any of these next states has dp[k][j][c][1] as False, then current state is True.

            ii. If it's Lucas's turn (turn 1):

               - Check all edges from j where the character >= cp (if cp !=0) or all edges (if cp ==0).

               - For each such edge (to k, with c):

                  - The next state is (i, k, c, 0).

                  - If any of these next states has dp[i][k][c][0] as False, then current state is True.

            iii. So, dp[i][j][cp][t] is True if any of the possible next moves leads to the opponent's state being False.

So, for each state (i,j,cp,t), we check all possible transitions. If there's at least one transition where the next state is a losing state for the opponent, then current state is a win.

This approach should work.

But how to implement this in Python efficiently?

Let's outline the code steps.

First, read the input.

n, m = map(int, input().split())

Then, read m edges. For each edge, we can store them in a data structure. For each node v, we need a list of outgoing edges sorted by character.

So, edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # since nodes are 1-based.

for _ in range(m):

   v, u, c = input().split()

   v = int(v)

   u = int(u)

   mapped = ord(c) - ord('a') + 1  # 'a' is 1, 'b' 2, etc.

   edges[v].append( (mapped, u) )

Then, for each node v, sort edges[v] by the mapped character.

for v in range(n+1):

   edges[v].sort()

But this will sort the edges in ascending order of mapped character.

Wait, but for each edge in edges[v], we need to find all edges where the mapped character >= cp. So, for a given cp, we can binary search to find the first edge with mapped >= cp. Then, all edges from that index onwards are allowed.

So, for example, edges[v] is sorted, so for a cp, the first index where mapped >= cp is found using bisect_left.

Thus, in code:

from bisect import bisect_left

For each node v, edges[v] is sorted. So, when processing a node v and a cp (could be 0), the allowed edges are:

if cp is 0:

   allowed_edges = edges[v]

else:

   # find the first edge in edges[v] where mapped >= cp.

   idx = bisect.bisect_left(edges[v], (cp, 0))  # 0 is the min possible u.

   allowed_edges = edges[v][idx:]

But wait, edges[v] is a list of tuples (mapped, u). So the bisect_left would find the first element where mapped >= cp. Because the list is sorted, bisect_left returns the insertion point for (cp, ...). So for example, if edges[v] has [(1, a), (3, b), (5, c)], and cp is 3, bisect_left returns index 1.

So the code for allowed edges would be:

if cp == 0:

   allowed_edges = edges[v]

else:

   idx = bisect.bisect_left(edges[v], (cp, 0))

   allowed_edges = edges[v][idx:]

Yes.

Now, the DP table:

We can represent the DP as a 4-dimensional list. But in Python, creating a 4-dimensional list for 100x100x27x2 may be memory intensive. Let's check:

Each cell is a boolean. So 100 * 100 * 27 * 2 = 540,000 entries. That's manageable.

So:

dp = [[[[False for _ in range(2)] for __ in range(27)] for ___ in range(n+1)] for ____ in range(n+1)]

But in Python, list comprehensions for 4D arrays can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, we can use a dictionary, but it's more efficient to use a list-based structure.

But perhaps it's easier to create the 4D list with nested loops.

But for efficiency, perhaps precompute it as a list.

But in Python, the initial allocation would be:

dp = [ [ [ [False] * 2 for _ in range(27) ] for __ in range(n+1) ] for ___ in range(n+1) ]

So for each i in 0..n, j in 0..n, cp in 0..26, t in 0..1.

Now, the order of processing is to loop through cp in decreasing order, starting from 26 down to 0.

Then, for each i and j, and for each turn (0 and 1), compute dp[i][j][cp][t].

But how to handle cp=0? Because for cp=0, the allowed edges are all edges of the current player's node, regardless of the character. So, during the processing of cp=0, we need to check all edges.

So the code outline is:

for cp in reversed(range(27)):  # 26, 25, ..., 0

   for i in range(1, n+1):

      for j in range(1, n+1):

         for turn in [0, 1]:

            if turn == 0:

               # Max's turn: move her marble from i.

               # allowed edges are from i, with c >= cp (if cp !=0) or any (cp=0)

               if cp == 0:

                  allowed_edges = edges[i]

               else:

                  idx = bisect.bisect_left(edges[i], (cp, 0))

                  allowed_edges = edges[i][idx:]

               can_win = False

               for c, u in allowed_edges:

                  # next state is (u, j, c, 1)

                  # check if the next state is losing for the opponent (Lucas)

                  if not dp[u][j][c][1]:

                     can_win = True

                     break

               dp[i][j][cp][turn] = can_win

            else:

               # Lucas's turn: move his marble from j.

               if cp ==0:

                  allowed_edges = edges[j]

               else:

                  idx = bisect.bisect_left(edges[j], (cp, 0))

                  allowed_edges = edges[j][idx:]

               can_win = False

               for c, u in allowed_edges:

                  # next state is (i, u, c, 0)

                  if not dp[i][u][c][0]:

                     can_win = True

                     break

               dp[i][j][cp][turn] = can_win

Wait, but the code above processes each (i,j,cp,turn) in the order of cp from 26 to 0, and for each i and j. But in Python, the for loops will process all i and j for each cp and turn.

But for each state (i,j,cp,turn), the allowed_edges are computed based on cp and the current player's node (i or j). Then, for each allowed edge, the code checks if the next state (u, j, c, 1) for Max's turn leads to a state where the opponent can't win (i.e., dp[u][j][c][1] is False).

But how is dp[u][j][c][1] computed before the current state? Since c >= cp (if cp !=0), and we are processing cp in reverse order (from high to low), then when processing cp=current, any c >= current would have been processed in a previous iteration (since c >= current, and cp is processed in descending order). For example, if current cp is 5, and c is 6, then cp=6 was processed before 5, so the state (u,j,6,1) has already been computed.

Ah, this is correct. Because when cp is processed in reverse order (26, 25, ..., 0), then when we are processing cp=k, all higher cp values (k+1 to 26) have already been processed. So for any edge with c >=k, the next state's cp is c, which is >=k. Since the code is processing cp in descending order, the next state's cp (c) must be >=k, and thus, those states have already been processed. Therefore, when we compute dp[i][j][k][turn], the next states (u, j, c, 1) (for example) have already been processed and their dp values are known.

This is a crucial insight. So the code is correct in this ordering.

Now, after filling the dp table, the answer for each starting position (i,j) is determined by the state (i, j, 0, 0), because the initial state has c_prev=0 (no previous character) and it's Max's turn. So if dp[i][j][0][0] is True, Max can win, so output 'A', else 'B'.

So the output is n lines, each line has n characters. The i-th line's j-th character is 'A' if dp[i][j][0][0] is True, else 'B'.

But since the nodes are 1-based, for i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n.

So the code will generate the output as follows:

for i in 1..n:

   line = []

   for j in 1..n:

      if dp[i][j][0][0]:

          line.append('A')

      else:

          line.append('B')

   print(''.join(line))

Putting this all together.

But let's test with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4 4

1 2 b

1 3 a

2 4 c

3 4 b

Sample Output:

BAAA

ABAA

BBBA

BBBB

In this case, the initial state for i=1, j=1 is (1,1,0,0). The code would check Max's possible moves.

Wait, let's see. For i=1, j=1, cp=0, turn=0.

Max can move from node 1. The edges from 1 are (a,3) and (b,2). Since cp=0, allowed_edges are all edges. So for each possible move, the next state's c is 1 (a) or 2 (b).

For example, moving to 3 with 'a' (c=1). The next state is (3,1, 1, 1). Now it's Lucas's turn. He must move from node 1, with edges >=1. So the allowed edges are the same as Max's, but Lucas is moving his marble (from j=1). So his edges are same as Max's, but he is in j=1. So he can move to 2 (c=2) or 3 (c=1). But the next state's c_prev is the c from the previous move (1), so Lucas must choose edges from 1 with c >=1.

So possible moves for Lucas are 1->2 (c=2) and 1->3 (c=1). Let's say he chooses 1->3 (c=1). Then the next state is (3,3, 1, 0), Max's turn. Max's position is 3, and she must move from 3 with c >=1. The edges from 3 are to 4 with 'b' (c=2). So she can move. Then it's Lucas's turn again, and so on.

But the code's DP will handle all these possibilities recursively.

But the code is correct in that the DP table is filled correctly.

Now, the code must handle all possible transitions correctly.

But what about the order of processing the nodes? For example, if a node is processed in the order of i and j, but the edges go to higher nodes.

But since the code processes all possible i and j for each cp, regardless of their order, and since the transitions are handled based on the cp's order, the code should handle it.

Another potential issue is the initial state of the DP. All entries are initialized to False. But when processing a state, the code will check for any transitions that lead to a losing state for the opponent.

So, for example, if a state has no possible transitions (the player can't move), then the code leaves it as False, which is correct (current player loses).

Now, let's think about the edge case where i has no outgoing edges. For example, if Max's marble is on a node with no outgoing edges. Then, during her turn, she can't move and loses. So the initial state (i,j,0,0) would be False, leading to 'B'.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code's time complexity: for each of the 100*100*27*2 = 540,000 states, for each state, the code may iterate through O(m) edges. But m is up to 100*99/2 = 4950. So in the worst case, 540,000 * 4950 = about 2.67e9 operations, which is way too big for Python to handle in 1 second.

Wait, but that's not correct. For each state, the code is processing the allowed edges for the current player's node (i or j). But the edges per node are up to n-1, since each node can have edges to any other nodes except itself (since it's a DAG). But for n=100, each node can have up to 99 edges. So for each state, the code processes O(k) edges, where k is the number of outgoing edges for the current player's node (i or j) that are >= cp (if cp !=0) or all edges (cp=0).

But in the worst case, for each state, processing 99 edges. Then, the total number of operations would be 540,000 * 99 = ~53 million operations, which is manageable in Python, perhaps, but may be tight.

But in practice, for the given constraints (n up to 100, m up to 4950), the code may pass within the time limit, but needs to be optimized.

But how can we optimize this?

The main bottleneck is the loops over the allowed edges for each state. To optimize, for each node, pre-sort the edges, and for each cp, precompute the starting index in the sorted list where the edges are >= cp. Then, when iterating, we can iterate from that index onwards. But even with this, it's O(k) per state.

Alternative optimization: memoize the allowed edges for each node and cp.

But perhaps a better approach is to precompute for each node a list of edges sorted by their mapped characters. Then, for each cp, use binary search to find the starting index of edges >= cp. Then, the allowed edges are from that index onwards. So, for each state, when checking transitions, the allowed edges are a slice of the pre-sorted list. This reduces the time per state.

But even with this, for each state, the code would loop through O(k) edges.

Another possible optimization is to, for each allowed edge, check the first possible edge that leads to a losing state for the opponent. If any such edge exists, the current state is a win, and we can break early.

Yes, in the code, for each allowed edge, the code checks if the next state is a losing state for the opponent. As soon as one is found, the current state is marked as a win, and the loop breaks. This is an important optimization. So, for example, if the first edge leads to a losing state for the opponent, the code breaks the loop and doesn't process the remaining edges for that state.

This will help in practice, as many states will have a winning edge early in the list.

So the code is written to break early once a winning edge is found.

Now, considering all this, the code should work correctly and within the time constraints for the given problem.

Now, the code can be written as follows:

Implementing the steps:

Read input, build edges for each node, sorted by mapped character.

Then, precompute the DP table in reversed order of cp.

Finally, output the results.

But in Python, the code may need to be optimized for speed. Let's proceed.

The code:

Case 1: move to 3, c=1. Next state is (3,1, 1, 1) (Lucas's turn). Check if dp[3][1][1][1] is False.

We need to compute this state.

Processing cp=1 for state (3,1,1,1):

Lucas's turn. He must move from j=1, edges >=1. So allowed edges are [(1,3), (2,2)].

For each of these edges:

c_edge is 1 (move to 3). Next state is (3,3, 1, 0). Check if dp[3][3][1][0] is False.

If any of the transitions leads to False, then the current state is True.

But to compute dp[3][1][1][1], we need to compute it during the processing of cp=1.

But this requires deeper analysis.

However, the code should handle this correctly.

The sample output's first line is BAAA. So for i=1, j=1, the result is B.

But according to the sample, in the first sample input, the first line is BAAA. So when i=1, j=1, the output is B.

So the code's calculation for dp[1][1][0][0] is False, leading to 'B'.

But why? Let's think:

Max's initial state (1,1,0,0).

She can move to 3 (a) or 2 (b).

Case 1: move to 3 (a, mapped to 1).

Next state is (3,1, 1, 1). Lucas's turn.

Lucas must move from j=1. The allowed edges are >=1. So allowed edges are 1->3 (a, 1), 1->2 (b, 2).

He can choose any of these.

For example, if he moves to 2 (b, 2), then next state is (3,2, 2, 0). Max's turn. She must move from 3 with c >=2. The edge from 3 is to 4 with c=2 (b). So she moves to 4. Next state is (4,2,2,1). Lucas's turn.

Lucas must move from 2 with c >=2. The edge from 2 is to 4 with c=3 (c), which is >=2. He moves to 4. Next state is (4,4,3,0). Max's turn.

Max has no edges (4 has no outgoing edges). She can't move, so she loses. So the state (4,4,3,0) is False.

Thus, when Lucas moves to 4, the next state is (4,4,3,0). Max can't move, so Lucas wins.

But this is just one possible path. The code needs to determine if any move by the current player leads to a losing state for the opponent.

But in this case, after Max moves to 3 (a), Lucas can choose to move to 2 (b), leading to a chain where Max can't win. However, if there's any path where Max can force a win, then the state is True.

But in the sample input's first case, the code outputs 'B' for (i=1, j=1), which suggests that Max cannot win. So the code correctly determines that all possible moves by Max lead to a situation where Lucas can force a win.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Now, considering all possible optimizations and edge cases, the code should be correct.
