Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully and understand what's required.

The problem is about splitting a text into messages such that each message is as long as possible without splitting any sentence, and the total number of messages is minimized. Each message can have up to n characters. But the key is that sentences are separated by punctuation followed by a space. Wait, the problem says the text is formatted in a certain way. Oh right, the input text is structured so that sentences are separated by a punctuation mark (like .!?) followed by a space. So each sentence ends with one of these punctuation marks followed by a space (except maybe the last one?), and the next sentence starts. So, the split points are between sentences. So Fangy can't split a message in the middle of a sentence; each message must consist of one or more complete sentences, and the total length of the message (without the trailing space between sentences) must not exceed n.

Wait, the note in the problem says that in the third example, the split is "Hello!", "Do you like fish?", "Why?". So the first message is "Hello!" which is 6 characters. The next is "Do you like fish?" which is 17 characters (count: Do you like fish? â†’ D o space ... that's let's see: D o   y o u ... wait the exact length. Let's check the example. The third input is 19. The first message is "Hello!" (6 letters), the second is "Do you like fish?" (17 letters), the third is "Why?" (4 letters). So 6+17+4=27, but each message is under 19. So each message is a complete sentence.

Wait, but how are the sentences split? The problem states that sentences are separated by punctuation followed by a space. So the original text is a sequence of sentences, each ending with one of .!? followed by a space. Except the last sentence, which ends with the punctuation and no space. So the input text is structured as follows: each sentence (except the last) ends with [.!?] followed by a space, and the next sentence starts. So the split points are after each punctuation (the one followed by space). So the sentences are split into these parts, and each message can consist of one or more consecutive sentences, but the total length (without the space between sentences) must not exceed the message size n.

Wait, the problem says: "If two consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them can be ignored (Fangy does not write this space)." So when consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them (the one after the punctuation) is not counted. But when they are in the same message, the space is part of the message. Because when sentences are in the same message, the space after the punctuation is included.

For example, in the first sample input:

Hello. I am a little walrus.

The two sentences are "Hello." and "I am ... walrus." (but wait, the second sentence ends with a .). The original text would be "Hello. I am a little walrus." So the first message is "Hello." (6 characters) and the second is "I am a little walrus." (length 19). Wait, but the sample input's n is 25, and the output is 2. Wait, the first message is "Hello." (length 6, including the '.'?), then the second is "I am a little walrus." (which is 19 characters). So 6 + 19 = 25? But n is 25, so each message is exactly 25? No. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's check:

Sample input 1:

n = 25

Text: "Hello. I am a little walrus."

Breaking into two messages. The first message is "Hello." (6 characters). The second is "I am a little walrus." (19 characters). 6+19=25, but each message can be up to 25. So the first is 6, the second is 19. So total two messages. So how is the space between sentences handled?

Wait, the first sentence is "Hello.", followed by a space. The second sentence is "I am ...".

In the first case, the two sentences are in different messages, so the space between them is not included. So the first message is "Hello." (6 characters), the second is "I am a little walrus." (19 characters). 6 + 19 = 25. But how about the space after the '.' in the first sentence? Because the first message is the first sentence, which ends with '.', then the space after is part of the separator between sentences. But when the sentences are split into different messages, that space is ignored. So the first message's content is "Hello." (length 6), and the second is the next sentence. So when combining sentences into a message, the space between sentences is included if they are in the same message. For example, if two sentences are in the same message, then the message would be sentence1 + space? Or sentence1's punctuation followed by a space, and then the next sentence. Wait, the actual text between sentences is a punctuation followed by a space. So when two sentences are in the same message, the space is part of the message. So, for example, if a message has sentence A and sentence B, then the message would be A's text (including the punctuation), followed by a space, followed by B's text (including the punctuation). Wait, no. Wait the text is structured as: each sentence ends with punctuation followed by a space, except the last one. So the actual sentences are:

sentence1 ends with punctuation and a space, sentence2 ends with punctuation and a space, ..., sentencek ends with punctuation (no space).

Wait, the problem says that the text is guaranteed to be in the correct format. So the input is like:

sentence1 is followed by [.!?] and space, then sentence2, etc., except the last sentence ends with [.!?] and no space.

So the entire text is a series of sentences separated by punctuation followed by space. The last sentence ends with punctuation.

So the sentences are split into parts where each part ends with punctuation followed by a space (except the last). So to split the text into individual sentences, we can split on these separators.

Wait, but how are the sentences split? For example, the text "Hello. I am here.Bye." would split into "Hello.", "I am here.", "Bye.".

So when building messages, each message is a sequence of consecutive sentences, and the total length of the message is the sum of the lengths of each sentence (including their punctuation) plus the spaces between them if they are part of the same message. Wait no: when two sentences are in the same message, the space between them is part of the message. For example, if sentence A is followed by a space and sentence B, then if both are in the same message, the message's text would be A's content (including its punctuation) + space + B's content (including its punctuation)? No, because the original text would have the two sentences separated by a punctuation followed by a space. Wait, the actual structure of the text is a series of sentences. Each sentence (except the last) ends with a punctuation followed by a space. The next sentence starts immediately after that space.

So, for example, the text is structured as:

sentence1: ends with punctuation followed by space

sentence2: ends with punctuation followed by space

...

sentencek: ends with punctuation (no space)

So when we split into messages, each message is a consecutive sequence of sentences. For example, if a message includes sentences i, i+1, ..., j, then the message's text is:

sentence1's full text (including punctuation) + (space) + sentence2's full text (including punctuation) + ... + space + sentencej's full text (including punctuation)?

No, wait the space between sentences is part of the original text. But when sentences are in the same message, the space between them is part of the message's content. But when they are in different messages, the space is ignored.

Wait, the problem says: "If two consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them can be ignored (Fangy does not write this space)."

So the space after a sentence (which is part of the separator between sentences) is included in the message's length only if the next sentence is in the same message. Otherwise, the space is not counted.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says: "the space between them can be ignored (Fangy does not write this space)." So when two consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them (the one that was part of the original text's separator) is not included in either message. So, for example, if a message ends with a sentence A, and the next message starts with B, then the space after A's punctuation is not part of either message.

But if A and B are in the same message, then the space between them is part of the message. So the message's text is A's full text (including punctuation) followed by the space, then B's full text. But when they are in different messages, the space is omitted.

So, the message's length is calculated as follows:

Each message is a sequence of consecutive sentences. For sentences in the message, the total length is the sum of the lengths of each sentence (including their punctuation) plus the number of spaces between them. Because when sentences are in the same message, the space is part of the message. But when they are split, the space is not counted.

So, for example, two sentences A and B. A ends with punctuation, then a space, then B. If they are in the same message, the message's length is (len(A) + 1 + len(B)), where the +1 is the space. If they are in different messages, then message1 is len(A), message2 is len(B). The space is ignored.

So the problem reduces to grouping consecutive sentences into messages such that for each group, the sum of (length of each sentence) + (number of spaces between sentences in the group) is <=n. And we need to find the minimal number of such groups. If any group's total exceeds n, then it's impossible.

So the steps are:

1. Split the input text into individual sentences. Each sentence ends with punctuation followed by a space (except the last one, which ends with punctuation and no space). Wait, but according to the problem's input format, the text is guaranteed to follow the correct structure. So the splitting is possible.

How to split the text into sentences?

Let's see. The sentences are separated by a punctuation mark (.,!?) followed by a space. So the end of a sentence (except the last) is a punctuation followed by a space. The next sentence starts after the space.

So the sentences can be split by splitting the text into parts that end with a punctuation followed by a space, and the last sentence ends with a punctuation (without the space).

Wait, for example, the text "Hello. I am here. Bye." is split into ["Hello. ", "I am here. ", "Bye."]. Then, each sentence is "Hello.", "I am here.", "Bye." but when splitting, the space after the punctuation is part of the separator.

Wait, perhaps the way to split is to find all occurrences of [.!?] followed by a space, and split the text into parts ending with the punctuation. The space is part of the separator.

Alternatively, the sentences can be considered as the parts between the start and the next punctuation followed by space. Let me think.

For example, the text "A.B? C! D." would be split into:

"A.B?" (since the next punctuation is followed by space), then "C!", then "D.".

Wait, perhaps splitting the text into sentences can be done by looking for all positions where a punctuation is followed by a space. Then each sentence is from the start (or after the previous separator) up to and including the punctuation. The space is part of the separator between sentences.

So, for example:

Original text: "Hello. I am here."

Split into ["Hello.", "I am here."]

The splitting occurs after the '.' followed by space.

So the process is:

1. Split the text into sentences. Each sentence ends with a punctuation mark, followed by a space (except the last sentence, which ends with punctuation and no space).

Wait, but how exactly to split this. Let's consider that the text is structured as a series of sentences, each (except the last) followed by punctuation + space, then another sentence.

So the sentences can be split by looking for the pattern [.!?] followed by a space. Each such occurrence marks the end of a sentence (excluding the space). So the sentences are the substrings from the start of the text up to and including the punctuation, then the next sentence starts after the space.

So to split the text into sentences:

Initialize a list. Start index at 0.

Loop through the text, checking for occurrences of [.!?] followed by a space.

Each time such a pattern is found at position i and i+1 is a space, then the current sentence is text[start:i+1], and the next sentence starts at i+2.

Add this to the list. Then start becomes i+2.

Continue until all such patterns are found.

The last sentence is from the last start index to the end of the text, which ends with a punctuation (and no space).

So for example, in the third sample input:

"Hello! Do you like fish? Why?"

Split into:

"Hello!" (ends with '!' followed by space. The next sentence starts after the space. Then "Do you like fish?" (ends with '?' followed by space. The next is "Why?", which ends with '?' and no space.

So the sentences are "Hello!", "Do you like fish?", "Why?".

So the lengths of these sentences are 6, 17, 4.

Now, when grouping the sentences into messages, the sum of their lengths plus the spaces between them in the group. Wait, no: when the sentences are in the same message, the space between them is part of the message. So for example, if two sentences are in the same message, the message's text is the first sentence's text (including punctuation) followed by a space, then the second sentence's text. But according to the problem statement, the space between sentences in the same message is counted, but when they are in different messages, the space is ignored.

Wait, the problem says: "If two consecutive sentences are in different messages, the space between them can be ignored (Fangy does not write this space)." So when two sentences are in the same message, the space between them is part of the message's content. But when they are in different messages, the space is not counted.

But how is the space between sentences handled in the message's length calculation?

Let's take two sentences, A and B. A is followed by a space and then B.

If they are in the same message: the message's text is A followed by space followed by B. So the length is len(A) + 1 (space) + len(B).

If they are in different messages: message1 is A (length len(A)), message2 is B (len(B)). The space between is ignored.

But for the last sentence, there is no trailing space. So when the last sentence is in a message alone, its length is len(sentence).

So the problem is to group the sentences into consecutive groups (messages), such that for each group, the sum of the lengths of the sentences in the group plus the number of spaces between them (since each space between sentences in the same group adds 1 to the total) is <=n. And we need to find the minimal number of groups possible.

So for example, in the third sample:

sentences are "Hello!" (6), "Do you like fish?" (17), "Why?" (4).

The n is 19.

Grouping the first sentence alone: 6 <=19. Then the second sentence is 17. But 17 <=19, so group it alone. Then third is 4. So total 3 messages. Which matches the sample.

But why can't the second and third be grouped together? 17 + 1 +4=22>19. So no. So they can't be grouped.

So the algorithm is:

1. Split the text into sentences, each with their lengths (including the punctuation, but not including any trailing space, except the last one? Or how?)

Wait, how to compute the length of each sentence. The sentences in the list are the parts of the text that are between the start and the punctuation followed by space (for all but the last sentence). The last sentence is the remaining part (ends with punctuation, no space).

So each sentence's length is the number of characters in the sentence. For example, "Hello!" has length 6. "Do you like fish?" has length 16 (D, o, space, y, o, u, ...? Let me count: "Do you like fish?" has D o  (space) you like fish? That's D (1), o (2), space (3), you (3+3=6?), like (6+4=10?), fish? (10+5=15?) Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The actual sentence is "Do you like fish?" which is 16 characters? Let's count:

D o   y o u   l i k e   f i s h ?

Letters and spaces: D (1), o (2), space (3), y (4), o (5), u (6), space (7), l (8), i (9), k (10), e (11), space (12), f (13), i (14), s (15), h (16), ? (17). Wait, that's 17 characters. Hmm, but the sample says that the second message is "Do you like fish?" which is 17 characters, which fits into 19. So in that case, the length is 17.

So the problem's sentences' lengths include all the characters in the sentence (letters, punctuation, spaces within the sentence). So when we split the text into sentences, each sentence's length is the number of characters in that part of the text, excluding any trailing space (if it's part of the separator). For example, in the text "Hello. I am...", the first sentence is "Hello." (6 characters), followed by a space. The space is part of the separator between sentences and is not included in the sentence's length. Wait, but when splitting the sentences, how is the space handled?

Ah, here's the confusion. Let's think again: the sentences are split such that each sentence (except the last) is the part of the text up to and including the punctuation, and the space is part of the separator. So for example, the text "Hello. I am..." is split into "Hello." (the punctuation is included) and "I am...". The space after the '.' is part of the separator, not part of either sentence.

So the length of each sentence is the number of characters from the start of the sentence up to and including the punctuation. So for example, the first sentence "Hello." has length 6 (H e l l o .). Then the space after is part of the separator between sentences. So the next sentence starts after the space.

So in the third sample input, the first sentence is "Hello!", which is 6 characters. The second is "Do you like fish?", which is 17 characters. The third is "Why?", which is 4.

So the algorithm is:

- Split the text into a list of sentences, each with their length (number of characters in the sentence, including punctuation but not the separator space).

- The sum of the sentences' lengths in a group, plus the number of spaces between them (if they are consecutive in the same group) must not exceed n.

- The goal is to split the list into groups where each group's sum (sum of sentences' lengths in group) + (number of spaces between sentences in group) <=n. Each group must be consecutive sentences.

We need to find the minimal number of groups. If any group cannot satisfy the sum <=n, then output is impossible.

So the problem reduces to a dynamic programming problem. For each position i in the sentences list, find the minimal number of messages needed to group up to i sentences.

Alternatively, we can approach this greedily. Since each message must consist of consecutive sentences, and we need to minimize the number of messages, we can try to fit as many sentences as possible into each message.

But the greedy approach may not work. For example, if combining two sentences into a message allows for a better overall solution, but the greedy approach splits them early. However, in this case, since the messages are consecutive, the optimal solution can be found greedily by adding as many sentences as possible to each message.

Wait, perhaps the greedy approach is correct here. Because for each message, the earliest possible start is after the previous message. So if we make each message as large as possible (without exceeding n), the total number will be minimal.

So here's the approach:

1. Split the text into sentences, each with their length.

2. Iterate through the sentences, accumulating the sum (sum + current sentence length + space if not the first in the group) and check if the sum exceeds n.

Wait, for each group, the total length is the sum of the lengths of the sentences in the group, plus the number of spaces between them (which is group size -1). Because each consecutive pair in the group contributes a space.

Wait, group is s1, s2, s3. The total is s1_len + 1 (space) + s2_len + 1 (space) + s3_len. So sum(sentences) + (group size -1).

So for a group of k sentences, the total is sum of their lengths plus (k-1). Because each pair contributes a space between them. So the sum is s1 + s2 + ... + sk + (k-1) * 1 (the spaces between them).

So for each group of consecutive sentences, the sum is sum(sentences) + (number of spaces between them in the group). The number of spaces is (k-1), where k is the number of sentences in the group.

So, for example, a group of one sentence: sum is s1_len. No spaces.

A group of two sentences: sum is s1_len + s2_len + 1.

A group of three: s1 + s2 + s3 + 2.

So the problem is to split the sentences into consecutive groups where each group's sum (sum of sentences' lengths) + (group size -1) <= n. Find the minimal number of groups.

If any group's sum exceeds n, output is impossible.

Now, how to compute this.

We can process the sentences greedily. Start with the first sentence. Keep adding sentences to the current group as long as the total sum (sum of sentences' lengths) + (group size -1) <=n. Once adding the next sentence would exceed n, split here, start a new group.

But what if adding a later sentence allows a larger group, leading to a better overall solution? For example:

n=10.

Sentences: 5, 3, 3.

Greedy approach:

Group1: 5. Sum 5 <=10. Next sentence is 3. Adding it to group1 would sum 5+3 +1=9 <=10. Then next is 3. Adding to group1: 5+3+3 + 2=13>10. So group1 is 5+3 (sum 9). Group2 is 3. Total 2 groups.

But another possible grouping is 5 +3 (sum 9), then 3 (sum3). Same.

Alternatively, if sentences are 7,3. n=10.

Greedy approach would take 7 as group1 (sum7), then 3 as group2. Total 2.

But 7+3 +1=11>10. So group1 is 7, group2 is3. Total 2.

Which is correct.

So the greedy approach works here.

Another example where greedy approach is correct.

But what about a case where the greedy approach would fail?

Example:

n=10.

Sentences: 6,3,3.

Greedy approach: group1 is 6 (sum6). group2 is 3+3+1=7. group3? No. So group1 is 6, group2 is 3+3 (sum7). So two groups.

But another possible grouping: 6+3 (sum6+3+1=10) as group1, and group2 is 3. So two groups. Same result.

Another example:

n=10.

Sentences: 4,4,4,4.

Greedy approach:

group1: 4. sum4. next is4. sum4+4+1=9 <=10. next is4. sum4+4+4 +2=14>10. So group1 is first two: sum9. group2:4. sum4. next 4: sum4+4+1=9. So group2 is two. Total 2 groups. So total is 2 groups.

But another possible grouping: group1: 4+4 (sum9), group2:4+4 (sum9). So two groups. Same result.

So in all these cases, the greedy approach works.

So the greedy approach is correct here.

So the plan is:

1. Split the text into sentences, each with their lengths.

2. Iterate through the sentences, and for each possible group starting at current position, find the maximum number of sentences that can be added such that the sum of their lengths plus (k-1) (for k sentences) is <=n.

3. If at any point, a single sentence's length exceeds n, then it's impossible.

So the steps:

- Split the text into a list of sentences' lengths.

- For each sentence in the list, check if its length exceeds n. If any, output impossible.

Because even a single sentence can't fit in a message.

Then, for the rest:

Initialize count to 0.

current_sum starts at 0.

current_group_length (number of sentences in current group) starts at 0.

Wait, maybe better to track the current group's sum.

We can track the start index of the current group.

For each start index, find the maximum end index such that the sum of sentences[start...end] + (end - start) <=n.

The (end - start) is the number of spaces between the sentences (since group has (end - start + 1) sentences, so (end - start) spaces between them).

So for start=i, we try to find the maximum j >=i where sum(sentences[i..j]) + (j -i) <=n.

If even sentences[i] is longer than n, then impossible.

So for each i from 0 to len(sentences)-1:

   if sentences[i] >n: impossible.

   else, find the maximum j where sum(sentences[i..j]) + (j -i) <=n.

   increment count, set i = j+1.

If during this process, any sentence can't be grouped (i.e., sum(sentences[i]) >n), then output impossible.

So the code steps:

Read n.

Read text.

Split into sentences.

Check each sentence's length. If any is >n, output impossible.

Else, process as follows:

count =0.

i=0.

while i < len(sentences):

   current_sum = sentences[i]

   if current_sum >n: impossible.

   j =i

   while j+1 < len(sentences):

       next_sum = current_sum + sentences[j+1] + 1  # adding the space and the next sentence's length.

       if next_sum >n:

           break

       current_sum = next_sum

       j +=1

   count +=1

   i = j+1

return count.

But how to split the sentences into the list?

This is the crux of the problem. How to split the input text into sentences.

So the code needs to split the text into sentences. Each sentence (except the last) ends with a punctuation (.,!?) followed by a space. The last sentence ends with a punctuation and no space.

So the code can split the text by looking for occurrences of [.!?] followed by a space. Each such occurrence is a split point. The sentences are the parts before the split points (including the punctuation) and the last part.

For example, "Hello. I am here." is split into "Hello." (including the .) and "I am here." (including the .).

Wait, no. Let's see:

Original text: "Hello. I am here. Bye."

Split sentences:

Looking for . or ! or ? followed by space.

First occurrence is ' . ' (after Hello.). So the first sentence is "Hello." (from index 0 to 5 (inclusive)), then a space at 6. Then next sentence starts at 7.

The next occurrence is ' . ' after here. So sentence is "I am here.", followed by a space. Then next sentence starts at 7 + len("I am here. ") = let's see, but perhaps the code can process the text as follows:

Initialize a list of sentences.

Start index is 0.

Loop through the text to find the positions where a punctuation is followed by a space.

Once found, add the substring from start to current index +1 (including the punctuation) as a sentence. Then set start to current index +2 (since the space is after the punctuation).

Continue until no more splits.

The last sentence is from start to end of text.

So code in Python for splitting:

sentences = []

start =0

i=0

text_length = len(text)

while i < text_length:

   if text[i] in '.!?' and (i+1 < text_length and text[i+1] == ' '):

       # found a punctuation followed by a space.

       sentence = text[start:i+1]

       sentences.append(sentence)

       start = i+2

       i +=2

   else:

       i +=1

# add the last sentence

if start <= text_length-1:

   sentence = text[start:]

   sentences.append(sentence)

So for example, text "Hello. I am here.":

Loop:

i=0. Check if text[0] is punctuation? 'H' is not. i increments.

...

i=5 (the '.'). Then check i+1 (6) is space. So split. sentence is text[0:6] (indices 0-5 inclusive, since Python slicing is up to end index exclusive). So "Hello." is added. start becomes 7 (i+2 =5+2=7).

Then i=7. Check if text[7] is punctuation. Let's say the rest of the text is "I am here.".

i=7 is 'I', not punctuation. Continue.

At i= the '.' in "I am here.":

i is at position len("Hello. I am here") - len(".") perhaps.

But perhaps in code, this will capture all the punctuation followed by space.

Once all splits are done, the last sentence is added from start to end.

So the code correctly splits into sentences.

Once the sentences are split, check each length:

for sentence in sentences:

   if len(sentence) >n:

       print("Impossible")

       exit()

Then process the sentences as per the greedy approach.

Now, what about the case where the sum of a group's sentences (with the spaces between them) exceeds n? The code must check each possible group.

Wait, the code in the greedy approach (as per earlier code):

current_sum starts as sentences[i]. Then adds sentences[j+1] +1 (the space). So each addition checks if the sum plus 1 (space) plus next sentence's length is <=n.

So this code correctly calculates the sum as sum of sentences in the group plus (k-1) spaces between them.

So the code is correct.

So putting it all together:

Read n, then the text.

Split into sentences.

Check each sentence's length.

If any is larger than n, output Impossible.

Else, process with greedy grouping.

Now, test the third sample input:

Sample 3:

n=19

text: "Hello! Do you like fish? Why?"

Split into sentences:

"Hello!", "Do you like fish?", "Why?".

Lengths: 6, 17,4.

Check each is <=19. Yes.

Then process:

i=0:

current_sum =6. Check next (j+1=1). 6 +17 +1=24>19. So group is only first sentence. count=1. i=1.

i=1:

current_sum=17. 17 <=19. Check next j+1=2. 17+4+1=22>19. So group is 17. count=2. i=2.

i=2: current_sum=4. count=3. i=3. Exit loop.

Total 3. Correct.

Another sample input:

Sample 2:

n=2

text: "How are you?"

Split into sentences. The text is "How are you?".

Wait, the text is structured as per the problem's note. Let's see:

The text is "How are you?".

But according to the input format, the text is guaranteed to be correct. So how is this split into sentences?

The entire text is a single sentence, since there's no punctuation followed by space except possibly the last.

Wait, "How are you?" ends with a '?', but there's no space after it. So the sentence is "How are you?".

Length is 11 (H o w   a r e   y o u ?). Let's count:

H o w (3) space (4) a r e (7) space (8) y o u (11) ? (12). Wait, "How are you?" has 11 characters. So len is 11.

But n is 2. 11>2. So output is Impossible.

Which matches the sample.

Another sample input:

Sample 1:

n=25.

text: "Hello. I am a little walrus."

Split into "Hello." (6) and "I am a little walrus." (19). Both <=25.

Processing:

i=0:

current_sum=6. next is 19. 6+19 +1=26>25. So group 1: 6. i=1.

current_sum=19. group 2:19. total 2.

Which is correct.

So the code works for the samples.

Now, handle edge cases.

Edge case where sentences can be grouped with exactly n.

Another case where a single sentence is exactly n.

Another case where a group has sum n.

Another case where a group has sum n-1, and the next sentence can't fit.

Now, coding this in Python.

But first, the code for splitting into sentences.

In Python, how to split the text into sentences as per the rules.

Code:

text = input().strip()

sentences = []

start = 0

i = 0

n = len(text)

while i < n:

    if text[i] in '.!?':

        if i +1 < n and text[i+1] == ' ':

            # split here

            sentence = text[start:i+1]

            sentences.append(sentence)

            start = i+2

            i +=2

            continue

    i +=1

# add the last sentence

if start < n:

    sentences.append(text[start:])

Wait, for example, the text "Hello. I am here.":

Loop:

i=0 is 'H', not punctuation.

At i=5 ('.'), then check i+1 is 6, which is ' ', so split. sentence is text[0:6], which is indices 0-5, which is 'Hello.'. Then start is 7. i becomes 7+1=7.

Then i increments until next punctuation.

Wait, perhaps code will have issues. Let's test for text "Hello. I am here. Bye.":

text is "Hello. I am here. Bye."

Splitting:

i=5 ('.') followed by space. Split into "Hello.", start=7.

i=7: 'I' ... next punctuation is at the end of "here." (i= 12?), which is '.' followed by space. Split into "I am here.", start=14. Then i=14: 'B' ... no punctuation followed by space. So loop ends. Add the last sentence from 14 to end: "Bye.".

So sentences are ["Hello.", "I am here.", "Bye."].

Which is correct.

Another example: text "A? B! C."

Split into "A?", " B!", " C.".

Wait, no. The code checks for punctuation followed by space.

In the text "A? B! C.", the split points are after '? ', '! ', and '.' (but the '.' is at the end and not followed by space).

So sentences are:

"A?" (i=0-1, since '? ' is at i=1 and i+1=2 (space). So start becomes 3. Then i=3 is 'B' ... until i=4 is '!', i+1=5 is space. Split into "B!". Then start=6. Then next split is i=8 ('.'), but i+1 is beyond the text. So the last sentence is "C.".

So sentences are ["A?", "B!", "C."].

Now, their lengths are 2, 2, 2. So if n=5, each group can have two sentences: sum(2+2+1) =5. So group1: "A? B! " â†’ sum 2+2 +1=5. Then group2: "C." (sum2). So total 2 messages.

So the code correctly splits sentences.

Now, code for the sentences splitting.

Once the sentences are split, check their lengths.

Now, the code.

Now, let's code the entire solution.

Read n from input.

Read the text (second line).

Split into sentences.

Check each sentence's length. If any len(sentence) >n â†’ output impossible.

Else, process the sentences with greedy approach.

Now, code:

Testing against sample inputs 2, 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    text = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    sentences = []

    start = 0

    i = 0

    length = len(text)

    while i < length:

        if text[i] in '.!?':

            if i +1 < length and text[i+1] == ' ':

                # split here

                sentences.append(text[start:i+1])

                start = i +2

                i +=2

                continue

        i +=1

    # add the last sentence

    sentences.append(text[start:])

    # Check if any sentence exceeds n

    for s in sentences:

        if len(s) > n:

            print("Impossible", file=output_stream)

            return

    # Now process the sentences with greedy approach

    count =0

    current =0

    total = len(sentences)

    while current < total:

        # take current sentence

        current_sum = len(sentences[current])

        # try to add as many as possible

        next_pos = current +1

        while next_pos < total:

            added = len(sentences[next_pos]) +1  # space before

            if current_sum + added >n:

                break

            current_sum += added

            next_pos +=1

        count +=1

        current = next_pos

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
19
Hello! Do you like fish? Why?
""",
            "output": \
"""\
3
""",
        }, 
        {
            "input": \
"""\
2
How are you?
""",
            "output": \
"""\
Impossible
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Another test case:

n=5.

Text: "A? B! C." â†’ sentences are ["A?", "B!", "C."]

Lengths: 2,2,2.

Processing:

current=0:

current_sum=2.

Check next_pos=1: added=2+1=3. 2+3=5 <=5. So add. current_sum=5. next_pos=2.

Check added=2+1=3. 5+3=8>5. So can't add. So group is 0-1. count=1. current=2.

sum=2. group count=2.

Total 2.

So correct.

Another test case where a group has sum exactly n.

n=5.

Text: "A. B. C."

sentences: ["A.", "B.", "C."], lengths 2, 2, 2.

Grouping: first two sum 2+2+1=5. third group sum 2. So total 2.

Yes.

Thus, the code should handle this correctly.

So the code is correct.

```python
n = int(input())
text = input().strip()

sentences = []
start = 0
i = 0
length = len(text)

# Split the text into sentences
while i < length:
    if text[i] in '.!?':
        if i + 1 < length and text[i+1] == ' ':
            sentences.append(text[start:i+1])
            start = i + 2
            i += 2
            continue
    i += 1
sentences.append(text[start:])

# Check if any sentence exceeds the maximum allowed length
for s in sentences:
    if len(s) > n:
        print("Impossible")
        exit()

count = 0
current = 0
total_sentences = len(sentences)

# Greedily group sentences into messages
while current < total_sentences:
    current_len = len(sentences[current])
    next_pos = current + 1
    # Extend the current message as much as possible
    while next_pos < total_sentences:
        add_len = len(sentences[next_pos]) + 1
        if current_len + add_len > n:
            break
        current_len += add_len
        next_pos += 1
    count += 1
    current = next_pos

print(count)
```
