<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to parse a string that represents a bill and sum all the prices correctly, then output the total in the specified format. Hmm.

First, I need to split the input string into a sequence of names and prices. Each purchase is a name followed by a price, so the structure is name1price1name2price2...namenpricen. So the first part is to separate the names and prices.

The names are lowercase letters, and the prices are digits and dots but following specific rules. So the approach would be to iterate through the string, splitting it into tokens where each token alternates between name and price. For example, the first part is a name (letters), then a price (digits and dots), then another name, etc.

But how to split them? Let's think. The names are made of lowercase letters. Prices start with a digit (since they can't have leading zeros and must start with a digit). So the split occurs when a sequence of letters ends and a digit starts. So we can scan the string and split into parts where each part is either a name (all letters) or a price (mix of digits and dots, but following specific rules). But since the input is guaranteed to be correct, perhaps we can process the string by alternating between parsing a name (letters) and a price (digits and dots), starting with a name.

So the plan is:

1. Split the input into a list of names and prices.
   - The first element is a name (letters), then a price (digits and dots), then another name, etc.
   - So iterate through the string, collect letters until we hit a digit. Then collect digits and dots until we hit a letter again, and so on.

Once we have all the prices, we need to parse each into a total in cents (to avoid floating point errors). For example, a price like "234" is 23400 cents. "0.99" is 99 cents. "123.05" is 12305 cents. "1.544" is 1544 dollars, which is 154400 cents.

Wait, the problem says that the price is written with possible thousands separators. So the dots in the dollar part are thousand separators. So for the dollar part, we need to parse the digits, ignoring the dots, then multiply by 100. Then add the cents part if present.

So each price is in dollars and cents. The dollars part can have thousand separators as dots. The cents part is exactly two digits if present.

So the steps to parse a price string:

- Split the price into dollars and cents parts. If there is a dot, check if it's part of the cents (exactly two digits after) or a thousand separator.

Wait, the price is structured as follows:

If it's an integer (no cents), then the entire string is dollars, possibly with thousand separators. Otherwise, after the dollars (with thousand separators) there is a dot followed by exactly two digits for cents.

So the first thing to do is check if the price has a cents part. The cents part is exactly two digits after the last dot. So, if there's a dot in the price, check if the part after the last dot is two digits. If yes, that's the cents. The part before is the dollars part (with thousand separators). If not, then the entire string is the dollars part (with thousand separators).

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

The price is written as:

- If integer, no cents. So the entire string is the dollars part (with thousand separators as dots).
- Otherwise, after the dollars part (with thousand separators) comes a dot and exactly two digits for cents.

So the presence of a dot in the price can be either:

a) Part of thousand separators in the dollars (like "1.544" which is 1544 dollars).
b) The decimal point separating dollars and cents (like "0.99" which is 0 dollars and 99 cents, or "123.05" which is 123 dollars and 05 cents).

So to parse a price string:

1. Check if the price has a cents part. The cents part is present if there's a dot followed by exactly two digits at the end of the string. So, split the string into dollars_part and cents_part.

For example:

- "234" → no cents, dollars_part is "234".
- "1.544" → no cents (since the dot is part of thousand separators), dollars_part is "1544".
- "149.431.10" → dollars_part is "149431" (since the last dot is followed by two digits → cents part is "10"). So dollars_part is "149.431" → when dots removed becomes 149431, and cents is 10 → total is 149431 * 100 + 10 = 14943110 cents.

Wait, so the correct way to split is: if there is a dot in the price, check if the part after the last dot is two digits. If yes, then that is the cents. The rest is the dollars part. Otherwise, the entire price is dollars part (with thousand separators).

So steps to parse a price string:

1. Split into dollars_part and cents_part:

   - Check if the string has a '.' followed by exactly two digits at the end. If yes, split into dollars_part (before the last '.') and cents_part (the two digits).

   For example:

   - "0.99" → dollars_part is "0", cents_part is "99".
   - "123.05" → dollars_part is "123", cents_part is "05".
   - "149.431.10" → split into "149.431" (dollars_part) and "10" (cents_part).

   Then, the dollars_part may have thousand separators (dots), which we need to remove.

2. Process the dollars_part:

   - Remove all dots from the string. Then parse as integer. Multiply by 100 to convert to cents.

   So for "1.544" → removing dots gives 1544 → 1544 * 100 = 154400 cents.

3. Process the cents_part:

   - If present, add the integer value of the two digits.

So the total cents for each price is (dollars * 100) + cents.

Once all prices are parsed into total cents, sum them all, then convert the sum back into the correct format for output.

Now, the problem is to sum all the cents, then format the sum according to the given rules.

So the steps are:

1. Parse the input string into a list of prices (each as a string).
2. For each price string, parse it into cents.
3. Sum all the cents.
4. Convert the total sum into the required format.

Let's start with the parsing of the input string into names and prices.

Parsing the string:

The input is a string that alternates between names (letters) and prices (digits and dots). So the first token is a name, then a price, then a name, etc. So, we can process the string by first reading letters until we hit a digit, then read digits and dots until we hit a letter, and repeat.

But how to do that in Python?

We can loop through the string, keeping track of whether we are in a name or a price. For example:

Initialize a list to collect the tokens (names and prices).

Start with the first character. Since the first token is a name, collect letters until we hit a digit. Then switch to collecting digits and dots until we hit a letter again. Repeat until the end of the string.

For example, in the first sample input: "chipsy48.32televizor12.390"

The tokens would be:

name: 'chipsy'

price: '48.32'

name: 'televizor'

price: '12.390'

But wait, the price '12.390' is the dollars part (since the last part after a dot is three digits, not two). So in this case, the price is 12390 dollars (because the dots are thousand separators). Let's see: the input's first price is '48.32' → which is 48 dollars and 32 cents. Wait, no. Wait, the price '48.32' has a dot followed by two digits. So that's 48 dollars and 32 cents. So the cents are 32. So the total is 48 * 100 +32 = 4832 cents.

The second price is '12.390' → this has a dot, but the part after the last dot is three digits. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the price is correctly formatted, so this must be a valid price. Wait, but according to the problem's example:

The first sample's input is chipsy48.32televizor12.390 → the first price is '48.32' (48.32 → 48 dollars and 32 cents → 4832 cents). The second price is '12.390' → which is 12390 dollars (since the dots are thousand separators). So 12390 * 100 = 1,239,000 cents. So total is 4832 + 1,239,000 = 1,243,832 cents → which is 1243832 cents. How to format that?

1243832 cents is 12438 dollars and 32 cents. So 12438.32. But according to the sample output, it's 12.438.32. Oh wait, how to format thousands separators. So the dollars part is 12438 → split into groups of three digits from the right. So 12.438. Then the cents is 32 → total is 12.438.32.

So the sum is 12438.32 dollars, which is 12438 dollars and 32 cents → 12438*100 +32 = 1243832 cents.

So the parsing of the price '12.390' would be:

Check if there's a cents part. The entire string is '12.390'. Are there any parts after a dot that are two digits? Let's see:

Split into parts by '.' → ['12', '390']. The last part is '390', which is three digits. So there's no cents part. So the entire price is dollars. So remove the dots → '12390' → 12390 dollars → 12390 * 100 = 1,239,000 cents.

So yes, that's correct.

So the first step is to split the input into names and prices. Then for each price, parse it into cents, sum them all, then format the sum.

So now, how to split the input into names and prices.

Let's think: the input is a string that alternates between letters and digits/dots. So the first part is a name (letters), followed by a price (digits/dots), followed by a name (letters), etc.

So, for example, the input starts with a name. So the parsing loop can be:

current_token = []
current_type = 'name' (since first is name)
for char in s:
    if current_type is 'name':
        if char is a letter (lowercase), add to current_token
        else (it's a digit or dot), then switch to price type. Add the current_token to tokens (as name). Start new current_token with this char, current_type is 'price'.
    else:
        if char is a digit or dot, add to current_token
        else (it's a letter), switch to name. Add the current_token to tokens (as price). Start new current_token with this char, current_type is 'name'.

At the end of the loop, add the current_token to tokens.

So in code:

tokens = []
current_token = []
current_type = 'name'  # first token is a name
for c in s:
    if current_type == 'name':
        if c.islower():
            current_token.append(c)
        else:
            # end of name, start of price
            tokens.append(''.join(current_token))
            current_token = [c]
            current_type = 'price'
    else:
        if c.isdigit() or c == '.':
            current_token.append(c)
        else:
            # end of price, start of name
            tokens.append(''.join(current_token))
            current_token = [c]
            current_type = 'name'
# after loop, add the remaining current_token
tokens.append(''.join(current_token))

But since the input is guaranteed to be in the correct format, the tokens list will have even length? No. Because each name is followed by a price. So the number of tokens is even? Wait, the first token is a name, then price, then name, then price, etc. So tokens length is even. For example, in the first sample input:

name, price, name, price → tokens is 4 elements.

But the code above appends the last token, which would be the price. So for input starting with name and ending with price (even number of tokens), the code is correct.

But what if the input ends with a price (which it must, since each name is followed by a price). So the code will correctly capture all tokens.

Once tokens is built, the prices are in the odd indices (indices 1, 3, 5, etc.).

So for each i in 1,3,5..., tokens[i] is a price string.

Now, for each price string, parse it into cents.

Parsing the price string:

As discussed earlier, the price can have a cents part. So, first check if there's a '.' followed by exactly two digits at the end.

So, split the price_str into dollars_part and cents_part.

For example:

price_str = '123.05' → split into '123' and '05' → cents_part is 05 (5 cents).

price_str = '149.431.10' → split into '149.431' and '10' → cents_part is 10.

price_str = '48.32' → split into '48' and '32'.

price_str = '12.390' → no cents part (last part is 390, 3 digits) → dollars_part is '12.390'.

So, the steps:

Check if the price_str has a '.' and the part after the last '.' is two digits.

So:

split = price_str.rsplit('.', 1)

if len(split) == 2 and len(split[1]) == 2 and split[1].isdigit():

then split into dollars_part = split[0], cents_part = split[1]

else:

dollars_part = price_str

cents_part = '00' (no, wait: if the price is an integer, then no cents part. So cents_part is 0. Wait, but according to the problem statement, each price is not less than one cent and not more than 1e6 dollars. So each price is at least 1 cent. So the price_str must represent a value >= 0.01 dollars. So when there's no cents part, it's at least 1 dollar, but that's not possible. Wait, the problem says:

Each price is not less than one cent. So, for example, a price_str of '0' is invalid, but according to the input constraints, the input is valid. So in the input, each price_str is valid. So if a price_str is an integer (no cents part), then the value is in dollars. But since it's >= 1 cent, the price_str must be at least 1 dollar, but no, that's not correct. Wait, for example, '0.01' is 1 cent. So if a price is '0.01', then it's 0 dollars and 1 cent. But if a price is '1', then it's 1 dollar (100 cents). So the code must handle that.

So, back to parsing:

if the price_str has a cents part (two digits after last dot), then:

dollars_part is split[0], cents_part is split[1]

else:

dollars_part is price_str, cents_part is '00' → no, wait. No, because if there's no cents part, then the price is in dollars (integer), and cents_part is 0. For example, price_str is '234' → 234 dollars → 23400 cents.

But how to determine if there's a cents part. So for the price_str:

split into parts = price_str.rsplit('.', 1)

if len(parts) == 2 and parts[1].isdigit() and len(parts[1]) == 2:

   dollars_part = parts[0]

   cents_part = parts[1]

else:

   dollars_part = price_str

   cents_part = '00'

Wait, but for '0.99', split into ['0', '99'] → which is correct. For '123.05', same.

For '1.544', split into ['1', '544'] → len(parts[1]) is 3 → so no cents part. So dollars_part is '1.544' → process into 1544 dollars → 1544 * 100 = 154400 cents.

For '12.390', split into ['12', '390'] → parts[1] is 3 digits → no cents part. dollars_part is '12.390' → process into 12390 dollars → 12390 * 100 = 1239000 cents.

So the code would be:

price_str = ... # current price string

split = price_str.rsplit('.', 1)

if len(split) == 2 and len(split[1]) == 2 and split[1].isdigit():

    dollars_part, cents_part = split

else:

    dollars_part = price_str

    cents_part = '00'

But wait, in the case where there's a cents part, but the dollars_part may contain dots as thousand separators. So for the dollars_part, we need to remove all dots and parse as integer.

So, dollars = int(dollars_part.replace('.', '')) → gives the correct dollar amount.

Then, the total cents for this price is dollars * 100 + int(cents_part)

But how do we handle leading zeros? For example, the problem says that the price has no leading zeros. So the input is correct, so we don't need to handle that. We can safely parse the numbers.

So, code for parsing a price_str into cents:

def parse_price(price_str):

    split = price_str.rsplit('.', 1)

    if len(split) == 2 and len(split[1]) == 2 and split[1].isdigit():

        dollars_part, cents_part = split

        cents = int(cents_part)

    else:

        dollars_part = price_str

        cents = 0

    # process dollars_part: remove all dots and parse as integer

    dollars = int(dollars_part.replace('.', ''))

    total_cents = dollars * 100 + cents

    return total_cents

Wait, but in the case where the split has two parts, but the cents_part is two digits. For example, '0.99' → dollars_part is '0', cents_part is '99' → dollars is 0 → 0 * 100 +99 =99 cents.

For '149.431.10' → dollars_part is '149.431', which becomes 149431 → 149431 *100 +10 = 14943110.

Yes.

Once all prices are parsed to cents, sum all the cents.

Then, the sum is converted back to the correct format.

Now, formatting the sum into the required string.

The sum is total_cents.

We need to split into dollars and cents:

dollars = total_cents // 100

cents = total_cents % 100

So, the cents part is always two digits. If cents is zero, we don't include it. Wait, no. The problem's output format says that the price should be written in the same format as the input.

Looking at the problem's examples:

In sample 3, input 'aa0.01t0.03' → sum is 0.04 (which is 4 cents). The output is '0.04' → which includes the cents part.

So, the cents part must be included if cents is non-zero. If the total is an integer (cents = 0), then output as dollars only.

So, the output format is:

- If cents == 0 → output the dollars part with thousand separators.
- Else → output the dollars part with thousand separators, followed by a dot and the two-digit cents.

So, the steps to format the total:

1. Split into dollars and cents.

2. If cents is zero, format only the dollars part, with thousand separators as dots.

3. Else, format the dollars part with thousand separators, add a dot, then add the two-digit cents.

Now, the thousand separators are added every three digits from the right. For example:

If dollars is 1234 → formatted as 1.234.

If dollars is 438 → 438.

If dollars is 1234567 → 1.234.567.

So, the way to format the dollars part is to take the string representation of the dollars, reverse it, split into chunks of three digits, reverse each chunk, then join with dots.

For example:

dollars = 1234 → str → '1234' → reverse → '4321' → split into groups of 3 → '432' and '1' → reverse each group → '234' and '1' → join with dots → '1.234'.

So, how to code this.

Function to format the dollars part with thousand separators:

def format_dollars(dollars):

    s = str(dollars)

    # reverse the string

    reversed_s = s[::-1]

    chunks = []

    for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

        chunk = reversed_s[i:i+3]

        chunks.append(chunk)

    # reverse each chunk and join with dots

    formatted = '.'.join(chunk[::-1] for chunk in chunks[::-1])

    return formatted

Wait, let's test this.

For dollars = 1234 → s is '1234', reversed is '4321'.

split into chunks of 3:

i=0 → '432', i=3 → '1'.

chunks are ['432', '1'].

Then, reverse each chunk in chunks[::-1] → chunks[::-1] is ['1', '432'].

Then, each chunk is reversed → '1' → '1', '432' → '234'.

Join with dots: '1.234'.

Which is correct.

Another example: dollars = 1234567 → '1234567' reversed is '7654321'. Split into 7, 654, 321? Wait, reversed string is '7654321'.

split into i=0: 765, i=3: 432, i=6: 1?

Wait, for reversed_s = '7654321', len is 7.

range(0,7,3) → 0,3,6.

i=0 → 0-3: '765'

i=3 → 3-6: '432'

i=6 → 6-9: '1' → but 6+3=9 exceeds len 7, so '1'.

So chunks are ['765', '432', '1'].

chunks[::-1] is ['1', '432', '765'].

Reversing each chunk:

'1' → '1'

'432' → '234'

'765' → '567'

join with dots → '1.234.567'.

Yes.

But the code as written may not do that. Let's see:

Wait, the code is:

chunks = []

for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):

    chunk = reversed_s[i:i+3]

    chunks.append(chunk)

Then, chunks[::-1] reverses the order. So for the reversed_s '7654321', the chunks are ['765', '432', '1'].

chunks[::-1] is ['1', '432', '765'].

Then, for each chunk in chunks[::-1], reverse it:

'1' → '1'

'432' → '234'

'765' → '567'

So joining with dots gives '1.234.567'.

Which is correct.

So this code works.

But wait, let's see code:

formatted = '.'.join(chunk[::-1] for chunk in chunks[::-1])

Wait, chunks[::-1] is the reversed list of chunks. Then for each chunk in that reversed list, we reverse the chunk (since it's part of the reversed original string).

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. For example:

Take the original dollars, reverse the string, split into groups of three, then reverse each group, then reverse the order of the groups and join.

Alternatively, the code as written:

Let me re-examine.

The code:

chunks = [reversed_s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3)]

So for reversed_s = '4321' (dollars 1234), the chunks are ['432', '1'].

chunks[::-1] is ['1', '432'].

Then, chunk[::-1] for each chunk in chunks[::-1] → ['1', '234'].

Joining with dots: '1.234'.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems to work.

So, the function to format the dollars part is as above.

Putting it all together:

Once we have the total_cents:

dollars = total_cents // 100

cents = total_cents % 100

if cents == 0:

    output the formatted dollars part.

else:

    output the formatted dollars part + '.' + two-digit cents.

But wait, the problem says that the price can't have leading zeros. So for example, if dollars is 0, but cents is non-zero, the dollars part is '0'.

Like sample input 3: sum is 4 cents (dollars 0, cents 4 → 0.04).

So, dollars can be zero. For example, 0.04 is a valid output.

So, the code for formatting the dollars part must handle 0.

For example, if dollars is 0 → the formatted dollars part is '0'.

Now, the code:

In the format_dollars function, if dollars is 0, then the reversed_s is '0', split into ['0'], reversed chunks would be ['0'], reversed each → '0', joined → '0'.

So that's correct.

Now, putting it all together:

So the steps are:

1. Split the input into names and prices.

2. For each price string, parse into cents and sum.

3. Format the sum into the required output.

Now, the code in Python.

Implementing the token split:

In code:

s = input().strip()

tokens = []
current_token = []
current_type = 'name'  # first token is a name

for c in s:
    if current_type == 'name':
        if c.islower():
            current_token.append(c)
        else:
            # end of name, start price
            tokens.append(''.join(current_token))
            current_token = [c]
            current_type = 'price'
    else:  # current_type is price
        if c.islower():
            # end of price, start name
            tokens.append(''.join(current_token))
            current_token = [c]
            current_type = 'name'
        else:
            current_token.append(c)
# add the last token
tokens.append(''.join(current_token))

# now, collect all prices (odd indices)
prices = []
for i in range(1, len(tokens), 2):
    prices.append(tokens[i])

total_cents = 0

for price_str in prices:
    # parse into cents
    split = price_str.rsplit('.', 1)
    if len(split) == 2 and len(split[1]) == 2 and split[1].isdigit():
        dollars_part, cents_part = split
        cents = int(cents_part)
    else:
        dollars_part = price_str
        cents = 0
    # process dollars_part
    dollars = int(dollars_part.replace('.', ''))
    total_cents += dollars * 100 + cents

# now format the total_cents into the correct format

dollars = total_cents // 100
cents_val = total_cents % 100

def format_dollars(dollars):
    if dollars == 0:
        return '0'
    s = str(dollars)
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(reversed_s), 3):
        chunk = reversed_s[i:i+3]
        chunks.append(chunk)
    # reverse the chunks order and each chunk
    formatted = '.'.join(chunk[::-1] for chunk in chunks[::-1])
    return formatted

formatted_dollars = format_dollars(dollars)

if cents_val == 0:
    print(formatted_dollars)
else:
    # cents must be two digits
    print(f"{formatted_dollars}.{cents_val:02d}")

Wait, but when dollars is zero and cents is non-zero, like 0.04, the formatted_dollars is '0', so the output is '0.04'.

Which is correct.

Testing sample input 3:

input is 'aa0.01t0.03' → the prices are '0.01' and '0.03'.

Parsing '0.01' → split into '0' and '01' → dollars_part is 0 → 0*100 +1 =1 cent.

Parsing '0.03' → split into '0' and '03' → 0*100 +3 =3 cents. Total is 4 cents → 0.04.

So dollars is 0, cents_val is 4. So formatted_dollars is '0', and cents is 04 → output is '0.04' → correct.

Sample input 1: sum is 4832 + 1239000 = 1243832 cents → dollars is 12438.32 → 12438 *100 +32 = 1243832.

dollars = 12438, cents = 32.

Formatting dollars: 12438 → reversed is '83421', split into 834, 21 → chunks ['834', '21'] → reversed chunks ['21', '834'] → each reversed → '12', '438' → joined as '12.438' → adding cents: '12.438.32' → correct.

Another test case: sample 2: input 'a1b2c3.38' → the prices are '1', '2', '3.38'.

Parse '1' → dollars_part '1' → 1 *100 =100 cents.

'2' → 200 cents.

'3.38' → split into '3' and '38' → 3*100 +38=338. Total 100+200+338=638 → 6 dollars 38 cents.

dollars=6 → formatted as '6' → output '6.38'.

Yes.

So code seems to handle these cases.

Now, let's code all this.

The code in Python:

Read s from input.

Split into tokens.

Collect prices.

Parse each price into total_cents.

Format the sum.

Now, code:

So putting it all together.

But let's test for edge cases.

Case where the total is 0.01 cents: total_cents =1 → dollars 0, cents 1 → output '0.01'.

Another case: 100.00 → output '100'.

But wait, cents_val is 0, so formatted_dollars is '100'.

But according to the problem statement, the price must be written without leading zeros, but '100' is correct.

Another case: dollars is 123456 → formatted as 123.456 → '123.456'.

Yes.

Another case: dollars is 1 → '1'.

Now, code:

But the function format_dollars(1) would return '1'.

Yes.

Another case: dollars is 0 → returns '0'.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

Now, code.

```python
s = input().strip()

tokens = []
current_token = []
current_type = 'name'  # first token is a name

        cents = 0
    dollars = int(dollars_part.replace('.', ''))
    total_cents += dollars * 100 + cents

dollars = total_cents // 100
