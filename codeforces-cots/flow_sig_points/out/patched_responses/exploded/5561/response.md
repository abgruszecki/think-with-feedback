Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem statement says that we need to find the maximum total area of m pieces in the garland, given some sheets of paper. Oh right, each piece in the garland has a specific color, and the sum of their areas has to be maximized. But how?

Wait, so the garland requires exactly m pieces, each of a certain color. The colors of the required pieces are given as a sequence. For each color in that sequence, Vasya can use pieces from his sheets. The sheets can be cut into parts, but each sheet is a certain color. So, for each color in the garland's required pieces, we need to check how much of that color Vasya has. Because, for example, if the garland needs 5 red pieces, but he has only 3 red sheets, then the maximum possible for those 5 red pieces is 3 (since each sheet can contribute at most 1, but they can be split into parts). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let's think.

Let me rephrase: For each color c in the garland's required pieces, count how many times c appears in the garland's sequence (let's call this required_count[c]). Then, for each color c, Vasya's available sheets have a count (available_count[c]). The problem is to allocate the available sheets in such a way that for each required c, the sum of the areas of the garland's c pieces does not exceed available_count[c] (since each sheet is 1, and can be split into parts, but the sum of the pieces' areas from a sheet can't exceed 1). However, the total number of pieces in the garland must be exactly m, and each piece must have a non-zero area.

But how do we maximize the sum of all areas? The maximum possible sum is the sum of the minimum between (available_count[c] / required_count[c]) * required_count[c], but wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

Wait, for each color c in the garland's required pieces, the number of pieces required is the count of c in the garland. Let's denote the required count as R[c], and the available sheets as A[c]. To maximize the total area, for each c in the garland, each of the R[c] pieces can have a maximum area. The sum of all those areas should be as large as possible.

But the key constraint is that for each c, the sum of the areas of the R[c] pieces from c must be <= A[c]. Because all those R[c] pieces are made from the available A[c] sheets of color c. Each sheet can contribute up to 1, but the sum of the areas for the R[c] pieces can't exceed A[c].

Wait, no. For example, if the required count for color c is 3 (i.e., the garland has three pieces of c), and Vasya has 2 sheets of c. Then, the sum of the three pieces' areas from c can't exceed 2 (the total available). So each of the three pieces can be of any size as long as their total is <= 2. But the problem is that we need to maximize the total area across all pieces. So for each color c, the maximum possible sum is the minimum between the available sheets (A[c]) and the required count (R[c]) multiplied by the per-piece allocation. Wait, maybe the optimal is that each of the R[c] pieces gets as much as possible, but the sum for c is min(R[c], A[c]) if A[c] >= R[c]? No, that's not right.

Wait, if R[c] is the number of pieces needed for color c in the garland. For example, if R[c] is 5 and A[c] is 3, then each of those 5 pieces can be at most 3/5 each. So the total for c is 3. Because 5 pieces each of 0.6 area sums to 3. But if R[c] is 3 and A[c] is 5, then each piece can be 1, and the total for c is 3. So the maximum sum for color c is min(R[c], A[c]) if available is >= required, else available. Wait, no. Wait, in the first case, when R[c] exceeds A[c], the maximum sum is A[c]. Because you have to split A[c] sheets into R[c] pieces, each of area (A[c]/R[c]). So the sum is A[c]. But if R[c] is less than or equal to A[c], then each of the R[c] pieces can be 1, so the sum is R[c]. But wait, in that case, you can only use R[c] sheets (each contributing 1), and the rest are unused. So the sum is min(R[c], A[c])? Wait, no. Let's see:

Case 1: R[c] <= A[c]. Then, you can assign each of the R[c] pieces to take 1 area (using R[c] sheets each contributing 1). The sum is R[c]. So yes, min(R[c], A[c]) is R[c], which is the sum here.

Case 2: R[c] > A[c]. Then, you have A[c] sheets. Each sheet can be split into parts, but the sum of all pieces from this color must be <= A[c]. Since we need R[c] pieces, each can get up to A[c]/R[c] area. The total is A[c].

So for each color c in the garland's required colors, the maximum possible contribution is min(R[c], A[c]) if A[c] is >= R[c], else A[c]. Wait, no. Wait in both cases, the maximum possible sum is the minimum between A[c] and (R[c] * 1) if A[c] >= R[c], else A[c]. So the sum for each color c is min(R[c], A[c]) if R[c] <= A[c], else A[c]. Wait, that's not right. Wait, when R[c] is 3 and A[c] is 5, then sum is 3 (each of 1). When R[c] is 5 and A[c] is 3, sum is 3. So the sum for each color is min(A[c], R[c]) if A[c] >= required R[c] for that color? No, in that case, the sum is R[c] if A[c] >= R[c], else A[c]. Wait, no. If R[c] is 3 and A[c] is 5, sum is 3. If R[c] is 5 and A[c] is 3, sum is 3. So the maximum sum for each color c is min(R[c], A[c]) if R[c] <= A[c], else A[c]. Wait, that's not right. Wait, for R[c] <= A[c], you can use R[c] sheets (each contributing 1 area) and sum is R[c]. For R[c] > A[c], sum is A[c]. So the maximum possible sum for color c is min(R[c], A[c]) if A[c] >= R[c], else A[c]. Wait, no. Wait, when R[c] is 5 and A[c] is 3, the sum is 3, which is A[c]. When R[c] is 3 and A[c] is 5, sum is 3 (R[c]). So the sum is the minimum between R[c] and A[c]? No, because R[c] is the count of pieces needed. So for each c, the maximum sum is min(R[c], A[c]) when A[c] >= R[c], else A[c]. Wait, but in the case where A[c] is greater than R[c], but R[c] is the number of pieces, each can take 1, so sum is R[c]. So for each color, the sum is min(R[c], A[c]) if R[c] <= A[c], else A[c]. Which is equivalent to min(R[c], A[c]) when R[c] <= A[c], else A[c]. But how?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the sum for color c is the minimum of (A[c], R[c]) if A[c] is greater than or equal to R[c], but otherwise, it's A[c]. But that's the same as the minimum of (A[c], R[c]) when A[c] >= R[c], else A[c]. Which is the same as min(R[c], A[c]) in all cases. Wait, no. Because when R[c] is larger than A[c], the sum is A[c], which is min(R[c], A[c]). So regardless of which is larger, the sum is min(R[c], A[c]). Wait, no. Let me think:

No. Let me see. If R[c] is 5 and A[c] is 3: sum is 3 (A[c] is smaller). So min(R[c], A[c]) is 3, which is correct. If R[c] is 3 and A[c] is 5: min(R[c], A[c]) is 3, which is correct. So in all cases, the sum for color c is min(R[c], A[c])? Wait, that can't be. Because in the first example:

Sample input 1:

Available sheets: aaabbac → counts are a:4, b:2, c:1.

Garland: aabbccac → counts are a:3, b:2, c:3.

So for each color:

a: required is 3, available is 4. So sum for a is 3. Because each piece can be 1, since available sheets >= required. So sum is 3.

b: required 2, available 2. Sum is 2.

c: required 3, available 1. So sum is 1.

Total is 3+2+1=6 → which matches the sample output.

So in this case, for a, the sum is min(R=3, A=4) → 3. For c, sum is min(A=1, R=3) → 1.

So the total sum is the sum of min(R[c], A[c]) for each c in the garland. But wait, that's only if for all colors in the garland, the available sheets are at least the required count. Wait no, the problem in sample 1 has for c, available is 1, required is 3. So the sum is 1. So the sum is min(R[c], A[c]) for each color? Because:

Yes, in all cases. Because when R[c] > A[c], you can split the available A[c] sheets into R[c] pieces. Each piece has area (A[c]/R[c]), and the total is A[c]. So the sum is A[c], which is min(R[c], A[c]). When R[c] <= A[c], you can assign each of R[c] pieces to 1 area (using R[c] sheets), sum is R[c], which is min(R[c], A[c]).

So the total possible sum is the sum of min(R[c], A[c]) for each color in the garland. Wait, no. Because in the case when R[c] is larger than A[c], the sum is A[c], which is min(R[c], A[c]). So yes, for each color c in the garland, the maximum possible contribution is min(R[c], A[c]). So the total sum is sum over c (min(R[c], A[c])).

But wait, is that correct? Let's see another example. Suppose:

Garland requires a, a, a. Vasya has 1 a. Then the sum for a is 1. So 1 is min(3,1) → correct.

Another example: garland requires a (once), and Vasya has 5 a. Sum is 1 (min(1,5)).

But then, the problem's maximum possible sum would be sum of min(R[c], A[c]) for each color in the garland's required sequence.

But wait, how do we handle the colors that are not present in the available sheets?

Ah, right. The problem says that if any color in the garland's required sequence is not present in the available sheets (i.e., A[c] is zero), then the answer is -1. So first, we need to check for all colors in the required sequence: if any color has A[c] == 0, then output is -1.

So the steps are:

1. Count the available sheets for each color (available_count).

2. Count the required pieces for each color in the garland (required_count).

3. Check if all colors in required_count are present in available_count. If any required color is missing (available_count[c] is 0), output -1.

4. Otherwise, for each color c in required_count, compute min(required_count[c], available_count[c]). Sum all these minima. That's the maximum possible total area.

Wait, but wait. Let's see the first sample. The required counts are a:3, b:2, c:3. Available counts: a:4, b:2, c:1. So for a, min(3,4)=3; b: min(2,2)=2; c: min(3,1)=1. Sum is 6. Which matches the sample.

Another example: input is a, garland is z. So required_count for z is 1, available_count is zero. So output is -1.

So yes, the approach is:

- Check for all colors in required: if any color is not present (available_count[c] == 0), return -1.

- Else, sum for each color c in required: min(required_count[c], available_count[c]).

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in some cases, even if available_count[c] is non-zero, but required_count[c] is higher than available_count[c], the sum is available_count[c]. So for example, required is a:5, available is a:3 → sum is 3.

So the sum for each color is min(required_count[c], available_count[c]). No, wait, no. Because in that case, sum is 3 (available_count is 3, required_count is 5 → sum is 3). So the sum is the min of required and available? No, no. Wait, sum is the sum of the min between available_count and required_count for each color. Wait no, no. Because the required_count is the number of pieces of that color. For example, required_count is 5 for a color, available is 3. Then, each of the 5 pieces must have a total area sum <=3. To maximize the sum, we have to split the 3 available into 5 parts. So the sum is 3, which is available_count. So the correct approach is for each color, the sum contributed is the min between available_count[c] and required_count[c], but only when available_count[c] >= required_count[c]. Otherwise, the sum is available_count[c].

Wait no. Wait, the sum for a color is the minimum between available_count[c] and required_count[c] when available >= required_count[c], but when available < required_count[c], the sum is available_count[c]. So the sum is min(required_count[c], available_count[c]) when available_count[c] >= required_count[c], else available_count[c]. Which can be written as min(available_count[c], required_count[c]). Because when available_count[c] < required_count[c], min(available_count[c], required_count[c]) is available_count[c]. So yes, sum over all c in required_count of min(available_count[c], required_count[c]) → but only if available_count[c] >=0. Wait, but required_count[c] is the number of pieces of that color. So the sum for each c is min(required_count[c], available_count[c]) if available_count[c] >= required_count[c], else available_count[c]. But min(available_count[c], required_count[c]) when available_count[c] is less than required_count[c] is available_count[c], which is correct.

Wait, no. Let's take available_count[c] as 3, required_count[c] as 5. min(3,5) is 3. That's correct. If available_count[c] is 5, required_count[c] is 3: min(5,3) is 3, which is correct. So yes, the sum for each color is min(required_count[c], available_count[c]). So the sum for each color c is min(required_count[c], available_count[c]). Then, sum all these minima across all colors. But we also need to check that all colors in required exist in available.

So the steps are:

1. Check for all colors in required: if any color is not present in available (available_count[c] == 0), return -1.

2. For each color in required, compute the required_count[c], and the available_count[c].

3. For each such color, take the minimum of required_count[c] and available_count[c].

4. Sum all those minima. That's the maximum possible area.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let's see:

Take the sample input 1:

required counts are a:3, b:2, c:3. available: a:4, b:2, c:1.

For each color:

a: min(3,4) → 3

b: min(2,2) →2

c: min(3,1) →1. Sum is 6. Correct.

Another example: required is a, a, a (3 times). available is 2. Sum is 2, since min(3,2) is 2. So the sum is 2. Which is correct.

So this approach seems to work.

So the steps for the solution are:

- Read the available colors and required colors.

- For each, count the occurrences.

- Check if any color in the required is not present in the available (i.e., available_count[c] is zero). If yes, output -1.

- Otherwise, for each color in required, compute min(required_count[c], available_count[c]).

- Sum all these minima and output the sum.

So, the code can be structured as follows:

Read the first line as a string, count the occurrences of each character.

Read the second line as a string, count the occurrences of each character.

For each color in the required counts:

   if available_counts[color] is zero → return -1.

   else, add min(required_counts[color], available_counts[color]) to the sum.

If all colors are present, output the sum.

Wait, but wait. For example, suppose required has a color with required_count 5, and available_count is 3. Then, sum +=3. Which is correct.

But the problem says that each of the required pieces must have a certain color. So, for example, if the required sequence has a color that's not present in the available sheets, then it's impossible, hence -1. So the code must check for that.

So, the code steps:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
from collections import Counter


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s1 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    s2 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    available = Counter(s1)

    required = Counter(s2)

    sum_area =0

    for color in required:

        if available[color] ==0:

            print(-1, file=output_stream)

            return

        sum_area += min( required[color], available[color] )

    print( sum_area , file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
a
z
""",
            "output": \
"""\
-1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second sample: available is a, required is z → code checks required's color z, available[z] is 0 → output -1.

Another test case:

available: a, a, a (count 3). required: a, a, a, a (count 4). Then code returns min(4,3) →3. Sum is 3.

Another test case: available has a, required has a and b → then code checks for required colors a and b. available[b] is 0 → output -1.

So the code should be correct.

So why the first sample's explanation says that for color c, the available is 1, required is 3 → sum is 1. Which the code correctly adds.

So the code seems correct.

But wait, what about when available_count[c] is greater than required_count[c]?

Like, available_count is 5, required_count is 3 → sum adds 3. Which is correct.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, this approach is correct.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total area of pieces in a garland that Vasya can create using the given colored sheets of paper. The solution involves analyzing the availability of each color required in the garland and ensuring that the sum of the areas of the pieces is maximized.

### Approach
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, count the occurrences of each color in both the available sheets and the required pieces of the garland.
2. **Check Feasibility**: Ensure that every color required in the garland is present in the available sheets. If any required color is missing, output `-1`.
3. **Calculate Maximum Area**: For each required color, the maximum contribution to the total area is determined by the minimum of the number of available sheets and the number of required pieces of that color. This ensures that we use the optimal distribution of available sheets to meet the requirement.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import Counter

available_counts = Counter(input().strip())
required_counts = Counter(input().strip())

total = 0
for color, req in required_counts.items():
    avail = available_counts.get(color, 0)
    if avail == 0:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    total += min(req, avail)

print(total)
```

### Explanation
1. **Counting Occurrences**: Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, we efficiently count the occurrences of each color in both the available sheets and the required garland pieces.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each color in the required garland, we check if it exists in the available sheets. If any color is missing (i.e., its count is zero), we immediately output `-1` and exit.
3. **Maximizing Area**: For each color required, we determine the maximum possible contribution to the total area by taking the minimum of the required count and the available count. This ensures that we either use the exact number of available sheets if they are sufficient or distribute the available sheets optimally if they are fewer than required.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total area while adhering to the constraints, providing an optimal solution in terms of both time and space complexity.
