Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if Vasya can create his letter text s2 using the letters from s1. The constraints are that he can use each character from s1 at most once, except for spaces. Oh wait, the problem says he doesn't have to cut the spaces from the heading. So spaces in s2 must be present as spaces in s1, right? Because he leaves blank space, but the problem states that he can use the heading's letters (but spaces are not cut, so they are just left as is). Wait, the problem statement says: "he just leaves some blank space to mark them". So I think that the spaces in s2 must be covered by spaces in s1. Because when he writes the letter, he can't create a space by cutting a letter; he can only use the existing spaces in s1. So, for example, if s2 has a space, there must be at least as many spaces in s1 as in s2. And for the other characters, each character (case-sensitive) in s2 must be present in s1 with a count less than or equal to the count in s1. Except for spaces, which must be exactly matched.

So the approach is:

1. Count all characters (including spaces) in s2, except that spaces in s2 must be exactly matched by s1's spaces. Wait, no: the problem says that he can use the heading's letters (each can be used once), but spaces are not cut. So when he creates the letter, he can add spaces by leaving blanks, but he doesn't need to take them from the heading. Wait, wait. The problem statement says: "Vasya doesn't have to cut the spaces out of the heading â€” he just leaves some blank space to mark them." So the implication is that the spaces in the letter (s2) are not taken from the heading. So he can have as many spaces as needed in s2, regardless of the number of spaces in s1. Because he just leaves blank spaces in the heading when creating the letter. So the spaces in s2 do not need to be covered by s1's spaces. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me read the problem statement again.

Problem statement: "Vasya can use every single heading letter no more than once. Vasya doesn't have to cut the spaces out of the heading â€” he just leaves some blank space to mark them."

Ah, right. So the spaces in the heading s1 are not used. Because he can leave blank space. So when creating s2, the spaces in s2 do not consume any characters from s1. So the steps are:

- For all characters in s2 except spaces, check that their counts (case-sensitive) in s1 are >= their counts in s2. Also, the spaces in s2 can be any number, but in s1, the spaces are irrelevant. Wait, no. Because the problem says that spaces in s1 are not cut. So when Vasya uses the heading, he can leave spaces in the letter by not cutting anything. So the number of spaces in s2 can be any number, but they don't require any characters from s1. So for example, if s2 has 5 spaces, and s1 has 0 spaces, that's allowed. Because the spaces in s2 are just left by not cutting the letters in those positions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here, but according to the examples:

Looking at the first example input:

s1 is "Instead of dogging Your footsteps it disappears but you dont notice anything"

s2 is "where is your dog"

The output is NO. Let's see why. The s2 has "your" but in s1, it's "Your" (capital Y). So the counts of 'y' and 'Y' are case-sensitive. So in the first example, since s2 has 'y' in "your", but s1 has 'Your' with capital Y, then the counts for 'y' in s2 is 1, but s1 has 0, leading to the answer NO.

But what about spaces? Let's see. For example, in the fourth sample input:

Input:

abcdefg hijk

k j i h g f e d c b a

Output is YES.

s1 has one space, s2 has 11 spaces (each character is separated by a space). But according to the output, it's possible. So in this case, the spaces in s2 (11) are allowed even though s1 only has 1 space. Because spaces in s2 are not required to come from s1. So the conclusion is that spaces in s2 are not part of the required characters. So when checking, we can ignore the spaces in s2. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the spaces in the heading are not cut. So Vasya can leave spaces in the letter by not cutting anything. So the spaces in s2 do not consume any characters from s1. Therefore, the number of spaces in s2 is irrelevant to the availability of spaces in s1. So the only thing we need to check is the non-space characters in s2: for each of them (case-sensitive), the count in s1 must be >= the count in s2.

So the approach is:

1. Count the frequency of each character (case-sensitive) in s1, except spaces. Because spaces in s1 are not used (since he leaves them as blanks, but doesn't cut them for the letter). So when processing s1, we can ignore the spaces.

Wait, no. Because the problem says that Vasya can use every single heading letter no more than once. The heading's letters include spaces? Or not? Because the problem statement says "he knows heading s1 and text s2 that he wants to send. Vasya can use every single heading letter no more than once. Vasya doesn't have to cut the spaces out of the heading â€” he just leaves some blank space to mark them."

So, the 'heading letters' in s1 include spaces, but Vasya can choose to leave them (i.e., not use them). So when he uses a space in the heading, he would cut it, but since he doesn't have to, he can just leave them. So the spaces in s1 are not considered as part of the letters that can be used. So for the purpose of checking, spaces in s1 are irrelevant. Only the non-space characters in s1 are available for use in s2's non-space characters.

Therefore, the steps are:

- For all non-space characters in s2, check that their count (case-sensitive) in s1 is >= their count in s2.

If that holds, output YES, else NO.

So the algorithm is:

1. Create a frequency dictionary for s1, but ignore spaces.

2. Create a frequency dictionary for s2, but ignore spaces.

3. For each character in s2's frequency dictionary (non-space), check if s1's frequency for that character is at least as much as s2's. If any character in s2 (non-space) has a higher count than in s1, output NO.

Otherwise, output YES.

So how to implement this efficiently?

Given the constraints: s1 and s2 are up to 200 characters each. So even a naive approach would work, but since it's easy, we can use Python's Counter.

So the steps in code:

- Read s1 and s2.

- Count the characters in s1, excluding spaces. So s1_counts = collections.Counter(c for c in s1 if c != ' ')

- Count the characters in s2, excluding spaces. s2_counts = collections.Counter(c for c in s2 if c != ' ')

- For each key in s2_counts, check if s1_counts[key] >= s2_counts[key]. If any of them is not, return NO.

- Else, return YES.

Wait, but what about characters that are in s2 but not in s1_counts? For example, if s2 has a 'X' that s1 doesn't have. Then in s1_counts, 'X' would have a count of 0, which is less than s2's count (say 1), so that would return NO.

Yes, that's correct.

So that's the approach.

Now, considering the examples:

First example input:

s1's s1_counts would include all letters except spaces. So in the first example, the s2's 'y' in 'your' would have a count of 1, but s1's 'Your' has a 'Y' with count 1. So 'y' is not present in s1_counts, so the check would fail, leading to output NO. Which matches the sample.

Second example: s2 is "Your dog is upstears". The 'Your' has 'Y', which is present in s1 (since s1 has 'Your' with uppercase Y). So all characters in s2's counts would be present in s1's counts with sufficient counts.

Third example: s1's 'your' is lowercase, s2's 'Your' has uppercase Y. So s2's Y is not present in s1's counts (since s1 has lowercase y?), leading to a check failure.

Fourth example: s2 has all letters in reverse order. But the counts for each letter in s2 are 1, and s1 has exactly one of each (since the first part is abcdefg and the second hijk). So all counts match, so output YES.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, for code:

Read s1 and s2 via input().strip() ?

But in the sample input, the first line is a long string, perhaps with leading or trailing spaces. But when counting, any space in s1 is ignored. So processing is okay.

In code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import collections


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s1 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    s2 = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    # count s1's characters except spaces
    count_s1 = collections.Counter(c for c in s1 if c != ' ')
    count_s2 = collections.Counter(c for c in s2 if c != ' ')

    for char, cnt in count_s2.items():
        if count_s1.get(char, 0) < cnt:
            print("NO", file=output_stream)
            return

    print("YES", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
Instead of dogging Your footsteps it disappears but you dont notice anything
Your dog is upstears
""",
            "output": \
"""\
YES
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Another test case:

Fourth example input:

s1: "abcdefg hijk" â†’ the characters are a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k. The space is ignored.

s2: "k j i h g f e d c b a" â†’ the letters are k,j,i,h,g,f,e,d,c,b,a each once, and the spaces are ignored. So in s2_counts, each of these letters has count 1. s1 has one of each. So all checks pass. Output YES.

Another test case where s2 has a character not present in s1: e.g., s1 is 'a', s2 is 'a b' â†’ the code would ignore the space in s2. The 'a' is present once. So output YES.

Wait, no. s2's 'a' is present once. s1 has one 'a'. So that's okay. The space in s2 is ignored, so the code would output YES. Because the code only checks non-space characters.

So the code is correct.

Now, the code uses Counter, which is efficient enough. For 200 characters, even in the worst case, it's O(n) time.

So the code should work.

import sys
from collections import Counter

def main():
    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')
    
    count_s1 = Counter(c for c in s1 if c != ' ')
    count_s2 = Counter(c for c in s2 if c != ' ')
    
    for char, needed in count_s2.items():
        if count_s1.get(char, 0) < needed:
            print("NO")
            return
    print("YES")
