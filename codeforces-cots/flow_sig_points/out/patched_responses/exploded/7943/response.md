Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of deletions needed so that the resulting string has no x-prime substrings. Let's try to understand what an x-prime substring is.

First, the definition says that a substring s[l1..r1] is x-prime if two conditions are met. The first condition is straightforward: the sum of the digits in the substring is exactly x. The second condition is trickier. It says that there are no smaller substrings within [l1, r1] where the sum divides x. Wait, no—the second condition is that there's no pair l2, r2 such that they are within the original substring (l1 ≤ l2 ≤ r2 ≤ r1), their sum is not equal to x, and x is divisible by their sum. So, if any such sub-substring exists, then the original substring can't be x-prime.

Wait, no. The x-prime substring must not have any such sub-substring. So, for a substring to be x-prime, all possible substrings within it (including itself) that have a sum that divides x must have sum exactly x. Otherwise, if there's a sub-substring with sum d (d divides x, but d != x), then the original substring can't be x-prime.

So the x-prime substrings are those substrings that sum to x, and do not contain any proper sub-substrings (i.e., substrings that are shorter) with a sum that is a proper divisor of x.

The task is to delete characters such that all such x-prime substrings are eliminated, and find the minimal number of deletions required.

Hmm. So first, we need to find all x-prime substrings in the original string, and then determine which characters to delete so that none of these substrings remain. The problem is similar to interval covering, where we want to select the minimal number of deletions (i.e., covering the intervals with the least points) to break all forbidden intervals.

Wait, but the forbidden intervals are the x-prime substrings. Each such substring is a range [l, r] in the original string. To eliminate it, we need to delete at least one character from it. The minimal number of deletions would be equivalent to finding the minimal number of positions (characters) to delete such that every forbidden interval contains at least one deleted character. This is the classic interval covering problem, which can be solved by the greedy algorithm of selecting the earliest possible end points.

But first, we need to generate all the x-prime substrings in the original string. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of points (positions to delete) that hit all these intervals. The greedy approach for interval covering is to sort the intervals by their end points and pick the earliest end, then select the next interval that starts after the previous end, etc. This gives the minimal number of points required.

So the steps would be:

1. Find all x-prime substrings in the string s. Each is represented by its start and end indices (0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based in Python, but need to be careful).

2. Once we have all the x-prime intervals, we need to select the minimal number of deletions (points) such that each interval has at least one point. This is equivalent to the interval covering problem where the points are the positions to delete. The optimal approach is to select the intervals in order of their end points, and each time pick the end of the earliest-ending interval that hasn't been covered yet, then remove all intervals that include this point. Repeat until all intervals are covered.

So, the key challenge is efficiently finding all x-prime substrings in the given string s.

Now, how do we find all x-prime substrings?

First, for each possible substring of s, compute its sum. Then, check if the sum equals x. For those substrings where the sum is x, we need to check whether they are x-prime.

But for the second condition, we need to ensure that there's no proper sub-substring (i.e., a substring of [l, r] that is not the entire [l, r]) whose sum divides x and is not equal to x. So, for the substring [l, r], sum is x, and all possible sub-substrings [a, b] where l ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r and [a, b] is a proper subset (i.e., (a, b) != (l, r)), must have a sum that does not divide x. Wait no: the condition is that there are no such [a, b] where sum is d, d divides x, and d != x.

So for [l, r] to be x-prime, the sum must be x, and all proper sub-substrings must not have a sum that is a proper divisor of x. So any d that divides x (d < x) must not be the sum of any proper sub-substring of [l, r].

Therefore, to check if a substring [l, r] with sum x is x-prime, we need to check all possible divisors d of x where d < x, and ensure that no sub-substring of [l, r] has a sum equal to d.

So, how do we efficiently compute this?

Given that x can be up to 20, the number of possible divisors (excluding x itself) is small. Let's precompute all proper divisors of x. For example, if x is 8, proper divisors are 1, 2, 4. So for any substring with sum 8, we need to check if any of its substrings have sum 1, 2, or 4. If none of those sums exist in any of the substrings, then it's an x-prime substring.

But how do we check this efficiently for all possible substrings of [l, r]?

The naive approach would be, for each candidate substring [l, r] (sum x), iterate through all possible substrings of [l, r] (excluding [l, r] itself) and check if any of their sums is a proper divisor of x. If any such sum exists, then [l, r] is not x-prime.

But this approach would be O(n^4) in the worst case (since for each O(n^2) substring, each of their O(n^2) sub-substrings must be checked). For n=1000, this is way too slow.

We need a more efficient way.

Alternative approach:

For each possible substring [l, r], compute the sum. If sum is x, then check whether any of the proper divisors of x are present as a sum of any of [l, r]'s substrings. If any such d exists, then this substring is not x-prime. Otherwise, it is x-prime.

But how to check this quickly?

An alternative idea: precompute for all possible substrings [a, b], their sum, and then for each possible sum that is a proper divisor of x, collect all intervals where the sum is d. Then, for a candidate [l, r], if any of the intervals [a, b] (which are for sums d) is contained within [l, r], then [l, r] is not x-prime.

So the problem becomes: for each candidate [l, r], check if there exists a [a, b] in the list of d-sum intervals (where d is a proper divisor of x) such that [a, b] is contained within [l, r].

If any such [a, b] exists, then the candidate is invalid (not x-prime). Otherwise, it is x-prime.

This way, we can precompute all intervals with sum equal to a proper divisor of x, and then for each candidate [l, r], check if any of these intervals is contained within [l, r].

But how to check this efficiently?

Another approach: for each candidate [l, r], we can check all the intervals in the d-sum list (for d in divisors of x) and see if any of them is a subinterval of [l, r]. But again, this could be time-consuming if there are many such intervals.

Let's think about the constraints.

The string length is up to 1000. So the number of possible substrings is O(n^2) = 1e6. For each such substring, if the sum is x, then we need to check all d-sum intervals to see if any is contained in it.

But x can be up to 20, so the number of proper divisors is small. For example, x=20 has divisors 1,2,4,5,10. So up to 5 divisors. For each divisor d, we can precompute all intervals [a, b] where the sum is d. Then, for each candidate [l, r], check for each d in divisors, whether there's any interval in the d's list that is contained within [l, r].

But how to check that efficiently?

For each d, we can precompute all intervals with sum d. Then, for a given [l, r], we can check for each d in divisors, if there exists a [a, b] in d's list such that l <= a and b <= r.

To do this efficiently, perhaps we can pre-process for each d, the intervals are stored, and for each [l, r], we can check for each d in divisors whether any interval in d's list is contained within [l, r].

But even this could be O(k * m) where k is the number of divisors (up to 5) and m is the average number of intervals per d.

But for each candidate [l, r], which is O(1e6) in the worst case, and for each of those, checking up to 5 * m intervals (m could be up to O(n^2) for each d), this could be O(1e6 * 5 * 1e6) = 5e12 operations, which is way too slow.

So this approach isn't feasible.

We need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: For each possible candidate [l, r] with sum x, the interval is x-prime only if none of the d-sum intervals (d being proper divisors of x) are contained within [l, r]. So for each such candidate, we need to make sure that for all d in divisors, there are no intervals [a, b] in d's list such that a >= l and b <= r.

So, for each candidate [l, r], for each d in divisors, find if there exists any interval [a, b] with sum d, a >= l, and b <= r. If yes for any d, then [l, r] is not x-prime.

To check this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each d, the intervals sorted by their start and end. Then, for a given [l, r], for each d, perform a binary search to check if any interval in d's list starts at >= l and ends at <= r.

Alternatively, for each d, we can precompute a 2D array that for any l and r, can quickly tell whether there's a [a, b] in d's intervals such that a >= l and b <= r. But precomputing that would be O(n^4), which is impossible.

Another approach: For each d, collect all the intervals [a, b] in d's list, sorted by their start and end. Then, for a given [l, r], for a particular d, we can check if there exists an interval [a, b] in d's list where a >= l and b <= r. How?

For example, if the intervals for d are sorted by their start a. Then, for a given l, we can find the first interval where a >= l. Then, among those, check if any has b <= r.

Alternatively, for each d, for all intervals [a, b], we can store them in a list sorted by a. Then, for a given [l, r], we can perform a binary search to find all intervals where a >= l and a <= r. Then, among these, check if any of their b is <= r.

But even that may take O(m) per check, which is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each d, precompute a prefix maximum or something. For example, for intervals sorted by a, for each position a, track the minimal b. Or perhaps, for each possible a, keep the maximum b such that there's an interval [a, b] in d's list. Then, for a given l and r, we can check if there's any a >= l such that the minimal b in [a, ...] is <= r.

Alternatively, for each d, precompute a list of intervals and build a segment tree or a structure that allows querying whether there exists any interval in [l, r] that starts at a >= l and ends at b <= r.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, we can precompute a list of intervals sorted by their start a, and for each such a, track the earliest end b. Then, for a given [l, r], for each d, we can find the first a >= l. If there's such a, then check if the corresponding b is <= r.

But even this may not be efficient.

Wait, but for each candidate [l, r], the maximum possible length is up to the entire string. However, the sum for the candidate is x. So the length of the candidate can vary. For example, for x=8, the candidate could be a single '8' (sum 8), or a substring like '53' (sum 5+3=8). The sum is x, so the length must be at least the number of digits needed to sum to x. For example, with digits 1-9, the minimal possible length for sum x is ceil(x / 9). For x=8, minimal length is 1 (since 8 can be achieved with a single 8).

But how does that help?

Hmm.

Let me think. The candidate [l, r] has sum x. For it to be x-prime, all proper sub-substrings must not have a sum that is a proper divisor of x.

So, for the candidate [l, r], any sub-substring (smaller than [l, r]) must not sum to a proper divisor of x.

Suppose x is 8. The proper divisors are 1, 2, 4. So any sub-substring of [l, r] must not have sum 1, 2, or 4.

If [l, r] is a single character (like '8'), then it's length 1. There are no proper substrings, so it's automatically x-prime. So in this case, the substring is x-prime.

Another example: if the substring is '53' (sum 8). The proper substrings are '5' (sum 5) and '3' (sum 3). Neither 5 nor 3 divide 8, so the substring '53' is x-prime. So in the first sample input, these two substrings are x-prime and must be deleted.

So, for a candidate substring [l, r], if it's a single character (sum x), then it's x-prime. Otherwise, for longer substrings, we need to check all possible sub-substrings (smaller than the entire substring) to see if any sum divides x (but is not equal to x). If any such sum exists, the candidate is not x-prime.

But checking all possible sub-substrings of [l, r] is O((r-l+1)^2) operations, which for a candidate of length up to 1000 would be O(1e6) operations per candidate. But the number of candidates could be O(1e6) (all possible substrings with sum x), leading to O(1e12) operations which is way too slow.

So, for the given constraints (n=1000), this approach isn't feasible.

We need a smarter way to check for the existence of proper divisors' sums in the substrings.

Alternative idea: precompute for all possible positions the prefix sums. Then, for any substring [a, b], the sum can be computed in O(1) time. So for a candidate [l, r], which has sum x, we need to check if any of its sub-substrings (excluding itself) has a sum that is a proper divisor of x.

But even with prefix sums, checking all possible sub-substrings is O((r-l)^2) time, which is too slow.

Alternative approach: For each candidate [l, r], iterate through all possible divisors d of x (d < x). Then, check if there exists any substring [a, b] within [l, r] (a >= l, b <= r, (a, b) != (l, r)) such that sum([a, b]) = d.

If for any d, there exists such a substring, then the candidate is not x-prime.

So the problem reduces to, for each candidate [l, r] (sum x), check for each d in divisors, whether d can be formed as a sum of any substring within [l, r], except the entire substring.

If yes for any d, then the candidate is not x-prime. Otherwise, it is x-prime.

But how to check this efficiently.

Hmm. Let's precompute for the entire string all possible possible substring sums and track their positions. Then, for each candidate [l, r], and each d in divisors, check if there's a substring [a, b] with sum d, a >= l, b <= r, and [a, b] is not the entire [l, r].

But even this seems challenging.

Alternative idea: For each d in divisors of x, precompute all the intervals where the sum is d. Then, for a candidate [l, r], we can check if any of the d's intervals is contained within [l, r] and is not equal to [l, r] itself.

But how to check if any of the d's intervals are contained in [l, r], but not equal to [l, r].

So for each d in divisors, we can check if there exists an interval [a, b] in d's list such that l <= a and b <= r, and either a > l or b < r (so that [a, b] is a proper substring of [l, r]).

Wait, but if [a, b] is equal to [l, r], but sum is d (which is a divisor of x), then the sum of [l, r] is x, which equals d. So d must be x. But d is a proper divisor, so that's impossible. So [a, b] can't be equal to [l, r] if the sum is d (a proper divisor of x). So for d in the list of proper divisors, any [a, b] in their lists would have sum d, which is less than x. So for a candidate [l, r] with sum x, the sum of [a, b] is d < x, so [a, b] can't be the same as [l, r]. Therefore, any [a, b] in the d's list that is contained within [l, r] (i.e., a >= l and b <= r) is a proper sub-substring. So, in that case, the candidate [l, r] is invalid (not x-prime).

Thus, the problem reduces to: for each candidate [l, r] (sum x), check if there exists any d in the list of proper divisors of x such that there is an interval [a, b] in the d's list that is contained within [l, r].

If yes, then the candidate is not x-prime. Otherwise, it is x-prime.

So, the steps to find all x-prime substrings are:

1. Precompute all proper divisors of x (d where d divides x and d < x).

2. For each d in these divisors, collect all intervals [a, b] in s where the substring sum is d.

3. For each possible interval [l, r] in s, compute the sum. If the sum is x, then check if any of the d's intervals are contained within [l, r]. If none, then [l, r] is x-prime.

So, the problem now is how to efficiently check for a given [l, r], whether any of the d's intervals are contained within it.

But how?

Let's think of the following approach:

For each d in divisors:

   For all intervals [a, b] in d's list, check if a >= l and b <= r.

If any such interval exists for any d, then the candidate [l, r] is not x-prime.

The question is, how to perform this check efficiently.

An alternative idea is to precompute for each possible [l, r], the minimal a and maximal b in the d's intervals. But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to precompute for each d, a 2D array where for any l and r, we can quickly check if there's an interval [a, b] in d's list that is contained within [l, r]. But storing such a structure for each d is O(n^2) per d, which may be manageable for x up to 20, since the number of divisors is small.

But even for n=1000, n^2 is a million, and multiplied by the number of divisors (say 5), it's manageable, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, for each d, precompute a 2D prefix sum array indicating whether there exists an interval [a, b] in d's list with a >= i and b <= j. So, for each d, create a 2D array exists_d[i][j] which is True if there is a [a, b] in d's list such that a >= i and b <= j.

But how to compute exists_d[i][j]?

This can be done by for each d, for each interval [a, b], mark all i <= a and j >= b. Because for any i <= a and j >= b, exists_d[i][j] would include [a, b]. But this seems computationally intensive.

Alternatively, for each d, we can precompute a matrix where exists_d[i][j] is True if there exists an interval [a, b] in d's list such that a >= i and b <= j.

To compute this for all i and j, for each d, we can iterate through each interval [a, b] in d's list and mark all i <= a and j >= b. But this would take O(m * n^2) time for each d, where m is the number of intervals in d's list. For m up to O(n^2) and d's up to 5, this is O(5 * n^4) which is 5e12 operations for n=1e3. Not feasible.

Another idea: for each d, precompute all possible intervals and for each interval [a, b], store the a and b. Then, for a given [l, r], check if any [a, b] in d's intervals satisfies a >= l and b <= r.

But again, checking this for each candidate [l, r] and each d is O(k * m) per candidate, which is O(1e6 * 5 * 1e6) = 5e12 operations. Not feasible.

So this approach is not going to work for n=1000.

Alternative approach: Think about the problem from another angle. For a substring [l, r] to be x-prime, it must not contain any sub-substring with sum equal to a proper divisor of x. So, for each d in divisors, the candidate [l, r] must not have any occurrence of sum d in its substrings.

So, if for any d in divisors, there is a substring of sum d that lies entirely within [l, r], then [l, r] is not x-prime.

But how can we model this?

An alternative idea is that for a candidate [l, r], the minimal possible interval that covers all possible d-sum substrings within it. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, think of the problem as dynamic programming. For each position, track the possible sums.

But this seems vague.

Another thought: the x-prime substrings must be minimal in the sense that they cannot contain any smaller x-prime substrings, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, but the x-prime substrings are those that sum to x and have no proper sub-substrings with sum dividing x (other than x itself). So, if a candidate [l, r] is x-prime, then it's possible that it's a single character (sum x), or a longer substring where all possible sub-substrings' sums do not divide x (except x).

So, for the single-character case, it's easy to check. For longer substrings, we need to ensure that all possible sub-substrings (of length >=1) do not sum to a proper divisor of x.

But for longer candidates, this check is expensive.

Alternative idea: For a candidate [l, r] of length m (sum x), the minimal possible sum of any of its substrings is 1 (if the substring is a single '1'). So, if x has a divisor 1 (which it always does except for x=1), then any candidate longer than 1 characters would have a substring of sum 1. But wait, x can be 1. For x=1, the divisors are none (since 1 has no proper divisors). So, for x=1, the x-prime substrings are all substrings of sum 1 and that contain no substrings of sum that divide 1 (but 1's divisors are only 1, so the condition is that there are no sub-substrings with sum 1. But that's only possible if the candidate is a single '1').

So, for x=1, the x-prime substrings are all single '1's. Any longer substring of sum 1 must contain a sub-substring (like another '1') which sum 1 divides x=1, making the original longer substring invalid as x-prime.

So, for x=1, the x-prime substrings are exactly the single '1's.

But this seems like a special case.

So, in general, if x has 1 as a divisor (which it does unless x=1), then any candidate [l, r] of length >=2 would have a substring of sum 1. Thus, such candidates can't be x-prime.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. The substring [l, r] could have sum x, but if it's of length >=2, but contains no '1's. For example, x=3, and the substring is '21' (sum 3). If there's a substring '2' (sum 2) which divides 3 (but 2 does not divide 3, so that's okay), but no substrings sum to 1. So, the candidate '21' could be x-prime if the sum is 3 and no substrings sum to 1 or 3's other divisors (3's proper divisors are only 1). So, if the substring '21' has sum 3, and no substrings sum to 1, then it is x-prime.

So, in this case, since x=3 has a proper divisor 1, the substring '21' must not contain any substrings summing to 1. So, if the substring is '21', then its substrings are '2' (sum 2), '1' (sum 1), and '21' (sum 3). The sum 1 is a proper divisor of 3, so the substring '1' would invalidate the candidate '21'. So '21' would not be x-prime.

But wait, no. The sum of the substring '1' is 1, which is a proper divisor of x=3. So, the candidate '21' (sum 3) contains a sub-substring with sum 1. Thus, the candidate '21' is not x-prime. So, any candidate of length >=2 with sum x and containing a '1' would automatically be invalid if 1 is a proper divisor of x.

So, if x has 1 as a proper divisor (which it does when x>1), then any candidate substring [l, r] of length >=2 can only be x-prime if it contains no '1's and no substrings of sum 1. But if there's a '1' in the candidate, then the substring consisting of that '1' has sum 1, which is a divisor of x, so the candidate is invalid.

Thus, for x>1, the only x-prime substrings are single-character substrings where the character is x. Because any longer substring with sum x must include at least one character, and if x has 1 as a proper divisor (which it does for x>1), then if the substring has a '1' in it, the single '1' is a sub-substring with sum 1 (which divides x), thus invalidating the candidate. If the substring does not have any '1's, then we need to check for other proper divisors.

Wait, this is only true when x>1 and has 1 as a proper divisor. For example, x=4, and the candidate is '22' (sum 4). The proper divisors are 1, 2. The sub-substrings are '2' (sum 2), '2', and '22' (sum 4). So, sum 2 is a proper divisor of 4. Thus, the candidate '22' would not be x-prime, since there's a sub-substring with sum 2, which divides x=4.

So, in this case, the candidate is not x-prime. Thus, the only possible x-prime substrings are those of length 1 where the sum is x. Because any longer substring would have at least one sub-substring of length 1, which sum is the digit itself. If that digit is a proper divisor of x, then the candidate is invalid.

Thus, for x>1:

An x-prime substring can be of two types:

1. Single-character substrings where the digit is x. Because then, there are no sub-substrings (since it's length 1), and the sum is x.

2. Longer substrings (length >=2) that sum to x and none of their sub-substrings (of any length) have sum equal to any proper divisor of x. But this is possible only if none of the digits in the substring is a proper divisor of x, and no combination of consecutive digits sums to a proper divisor of x.

For example, x=8, which has proper divisors 1,2,4. If a candidate is '53' (sum 8), the substrings are '5' (sum 5) and '3' (sum 3). Neither 5 nor 3 are proper divisors of 8. So this candidate is x-prime.

But if the candidate is '44' (sum 8), then each '4' has sum 4, which is a proper divisor of 8. So the candidate '44' is not x-prime.

So, the key insight is that for x>1, x-prime substrings can be either single-digit x's, or longer substrings where no individual digit is a proper divisor of x, and no sum of any consecutive digits in the substring is a proper divisor of x.

But how can we efficiently check for such cases?

This seems complicated. But perhaps for x>1, the only possible x-prime substrings are the single-character ones, and the ones where all digits are larger than any proper divisor of x. But even that isn't necessarily true.

Alternatively, perhaps for x>1, all x-prime substrings are single-character (sum x) or pairs of digits that sum to x and neither digit is a proper divisor, nor their sum has any proper divisors.

But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, for x>1, the only x-prime substrings are single-character x's and certain longer substrings that are "prime" in the sense of the problem's definition.

But how to find them efficiently.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to precompute all possible candidates and then check each one.

But for a string of length 1000, the number of candidates (substrings with sum x) is O(n^2), which is up to 1e6. For each candidate, the checking can be optimized.

Wait, here's an idea:

For x>1:

- Any single-character substring with digit x is x-prime.

- For a multi-character substring to be x-prime, it must have no proper divisors of x in its individual digits, and no sum of consecutive digits equal to a proper divisor of x.

So, for example, the substring '53' in the first example. 5 and 3 are not proper divisors of 8 (1,2,4). Their sum is 8. So, there are no sub-substrings with sum 1,2,4. Hence, it is x-prime.

But how to check for this.

So, for a candidate [l, r], sum x, and length >=2:

Check all possible substrings of [l, r] (excluding the entire substring) to see if their sum is a proper divisor of x. If any such sum exists, then the candidate is not x-prime.

But this is expensive for large candidates.

Alternative idea: For a candidate of length m >=2, the sum is x. The individual digits in the substring are all >=1 and <=9. So, any individual digit that is a proper divisor of x will make the substring invalid.

Thus, the first step is to check if any digit in [l, r] is a proper divisor of x. If yes, then the substring is invalid (not x-prime).

If no digits are proper divisors, then check if any pair of consecutive digits sums to a proper divisor of x. If yes, invalid. Then check triplets, etc.

But again, this is time-consuming for large m.

Alternatively, for a candidate [l, r] of length m >=2:

If any digit in the substring is a proper divisor of x (d), then it's invalid.

Otherwise, check if any sum of two consecutive digits is a proper divisor.

If none, check any sum of three consecutive digits, etc.

But again, this is O(m^2) per candidate.

But perhaps for x up to 20, the sum of consecutive digits in the candidate can be checked in a smarter way.

Wait, for a candidate [l, r], the sum is x. So the sum of the entire substring is x. Any sub-substring's sum is a proper divisor of x, which is d < x and d divides x.

So, for a candidate [l, r], if any of its sub-substrings (of any length >=1, but not the entire substring) has a sum that is a proper divisor of x, then it's invalid.

So, for a candidate [l, r], we can precompute the prefix sums and check for each possible sub-substring [a, b] (a >= l, b <= r, a <= b) if the sum is a proper divisor of x.

But again, this is O(m^2) per candidate.

But for candidates of small sum x (up to 20), the possible proper divisors d are limited. For example, for x=8, the divisors are 1, 2, 4. So for a candidate [l, r], sum 8, we need to check if any sub-substring has sum 1, 2, or 4.

Thus, perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums for the entire string, and for each candidate [l, r], compute the prefix sums from l to r, and then for each possible d in divisors, check if d exists in the prefix sums of [l, r].

Let me think: the prefix sum array for the substring [l, r] can be computed as follows. Let the substring be s[l], s[l+1], ..., s[r]. The prefix sum array for this substring is p[0] = 0, p[1] = s[l], p[2] = s[l] + s[l+1], ..., p[m] = sum from s[l] to s[r], which is x.

Then, the sum of the substring from a to b (within [l, r]) is p[b - l + 1] - p[a - l]. So, for each possible d in the proper divisors of x, we need to check if there exists two indices i and j in the prefix sum array of [l, r] such that p[j] - p[i] = d.

This is similar to the classic two-sum problem but with all possible pairs. For each candidate [l, r], we can compute its prefix sums and check for each d if d is present as a sub-substring sum.

This approach would take O(m) time to compute the prefix sums and O(m^2) time to check all possible pairs. But for x up to 20, the divisors are small, so maybe this can be optimized.

But for m up to 1000 (the entire string), this would be O(1e6) per candidate. Which is again impossible for 1e6 candidates.

Alternative idea: For each candidate [l, r], we can compute all possible sub-substring sums and check if any of them is a proper divisor. But how?

Perhaps, for each candidate, compute all possible sums of its substrings and check against the divisors.

But this is O(m^2) per candidate.

But for the problem's constraints (n=1e3), and the worst case where all O(n^2) candidates are checked, this is O(1e6 * 1e6) = 1e12 operations, which is way too slow.

So this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative approach: Precompute for each possible d (proper divisors of x) all possible intervals [a, b] with sum d. Then, for each candidate [l, r], check if any of those intervals is contained within [l, r]. 

But how to do this efficiently.

For example, for each d, we can precompute a list of intervals with sum d, sorted by their start and end. Then, for a candidate [l, r], we can iterate through each d's intervals and check if any of them is contained within [l, r]. 

But even this is O(md * k), where md is the number of intervals for divisor d and k is the number of divisors. For example, if each d has O(1e3) intervals, then for each candidate, this would be 5 * 1e3 = 5e3 operations. For 1e6 candidates, this is 5e9 operations, which is way too much for Python.

But maybe we can optimize further.

For each d, precompute the list of intervals sorted by their start and end. Then, for a candidate [l, r], to check if any interval of d is contained within [l, r], we can find the earliest interval in d's list where start >= l. Then, check if any of those intervals have end <= r.

But this can be done with binary search. Let's see.

For each d, sort the intervals in d's list by their start a. Then, for a candidate [l, r], we can binary search for the first a >= l. Then, among these, check if any of the corresponding b's are <= r. But since the intervals are sorted by a, but the b's may not be sorted, this requires checking all intervals from the first a >= l up to a <= r, and see if any of their b's are <= r.

Alternatively, for each d, sort the intervals by a, and for each a, track the minimal b. Then, for a given l and r, the earliest a >= l is found via binary search. For that a, if the minimal b is <= r, then there exists an interval. Otherwise, check the next a's.

But this requires storing for each a, the minimal b. But perhaps not.

Alternatively, for each d, sort the intervals by their start a, and for each a, keep track of the minimal b. This way, for a given l, once we find the first a >= l, if the minimal b for that a is <= r, then there exists an interval. But how to store this.

Alternatively, for each d, sort the intervals in d's list by their start a. Then, for each interval in the sorted list, keep track of the minimal end b up to that point. Then, for a given l, perform a binary search to find the first interval with a >= l. If there are any such intervals, check if the minimal b in those intervals is <= r.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each d, sort the intervals by a in ascending order. Then, for each interval in the sorted list, track the minimal b seen so far. For a given l, the earliest a >= l is found. If the minimal b among those intervals (from that point on) is <= r, then there exists an interval. But how to compute this.

Alternatively, for each d, we can build a list of intervals sorted by a, and for each position in the sorted list, precompute the minimal b from that position to the end. Then, given l and r, we can find the first index in the sorted list where a >= l. The minimal b from that index to the end can be found using the precomputed array. If that minimal b is <= r, then there's an interval.

Yes! This could work.

Here's how:

For each d in the divisors of x:

   Collect all intervals [a, b] with sum d.

   Sort these intervals by a in ascending order.

   Precompute an array min_b that, for each index i in the sorted list, stores the minimal b from index i to the end of the list.

Then, for a candidate [l, r], to check if there's any interval in d's list contained within [l, r], we can:

   Binary search in the sorted list of a's to find the first interval where a >= l.

   If such an interval exists, say at index pos, then the minimal b from pos onwards is min_b[pos]. If min_b[pos] <= r, then there exists an interval in d's list that is contained within [l, r].

This approach reduces the check for each d to O(log m) time, where m is the number of intervals for d.

So, the steps are:

1. Precompute all proper divisors of x.

2. For each d, collect all intervals [a, b] where the sum of the substring is d.

3. Sort each d's intervals by a in ascending order.

4. For each d's sorted list, precompute the min_b array, where min_b[i] is the minimal b from intervals[i ... end].

5. For each candidate [l, r] (sum x):

   a. Check if the candidate is a single character (r == l). If so, it's x-prime.

   b. Else, for each d in the proper divisors:

      i. Perform a binary search on d's sorted list to find the first interval where a >= l.

      ii. If such a pos is found, check if the min_b[pos] <= r.

      iii. If yes, then this candidate is not x-prime. Break and proceed to the next candidate.

   c. If none of the d's have intervals contained within [l, r], then the candidate is x-prime.

So, the key steps are:

- Preprocessing for each d.

- Efficiently checking for containment.

This approach can reduce the checking time per candidate to O(k log m), where k is the number of proper divisors (up to 5 for x=20) and m is the number of intervals per d (which can be up to O(n^2), but binary search is O(log m)).

Now, how to implement this.

First, compute the proper divisors of x.

Proper divisors of x are all divisors except x itself.

For example, x=8: divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8. Proper divisors are 1, 2, 4.

Then, for the original string, compute prefix sums.

Let's compute the prefix sum array for the entire string. The prefix sum array p has p[0] = 0, p[1] = s[0], p[2] = s[0] + s[1], etc.

Then, for each possible interval [a, b], the sum is p[b+1] - p[a].

For each d in the proper divisors, we need to find all intervals [a, b] (0-based) where p[b+1] - p[a] = d.

To find these intervals efficiently, for each d, we can iterate through all possible a and find b such that p[b+1] = p[a] + d.

But for each a, we can compute the target value (p[a] + d) and look for it in p starting from a+1.

But for each a, there can be multiple b's where p[b+1] - p[a] = d. So, for each a, we can find all b's >=a such that p[b+1] == p[a] +d.

To find this efficiently, for each a, we can use a hashmap that maps the value of p[b+1] to a list of b's. Then, for each a and d, we can look up p[a] +d in the hashmap and get all b's where p[b+1] is p[a]+d, and b >=a.

This can be done as follows:

Precompute a dictionary, pos, where pos[value] is a list of indices i where p[i] = value.

Then, for each a in 0 to n-1:

   target = p[a] + d

   if target in pos:

      for each b_plus_1 in pos[target]:

          b = b_plus_1 - 1

          if b >= a:

              add the interval [a, b] to d's list.

So, for each a and d, this finds all possible b's where [a, b] sums to d.

This approach can be done in O(n * k) time per d, where k is the number of occurrences of the target value in pos.

But for n=1e3, this would be O(n^2) per d, which is manageable for x up to 20.

Once all intervals for each d are collected, we sort them by their a value (start index), and precompute the min_b array for each d.

Once that's done, processing each candidate becomes manageable.

Now, the next step is to generate all possible candidates (substrings of sum x) and check them.

To generate all candidates:

Compute all possible intervals [a, b] where p[b+1] - p[a] = x.

Again, using the same approach as for the proper divisors: for each a, find the target p[a] +x, and check if it's present in pos. For each a, collect all b's where p[b+1] = p[a] +x, and b >=a.

These are the candidates.

For each such candidate [a, b], we need to check if it's x-prime.

For each candidate:

If the length is 1 (b == a), then it's automatically x-prime (since there are no proper sub-substrings).

Otherwise, check for each proper divisor d of x whether any interval in d's list is contained within [a, b].

If none are found, then the candidate is x-prime.

Once all x-prime intervals are collected, we need to find the minimal number of deletions to cover all of them.

Then, the problem becomes the classic interval covering problem: find the minimal number of points (characters to delete) such that each interval contains at least one point.

The greedy algorithm for this is to sort the intervals by their end points, and select the earliest possible end, then skip all intervals covered by this point, and repeat.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Collect all x-prime intervals.

2. If none, output 0.

3. Else, sort them by their end points.

4. Greedily select points to delete:

   a. Initialize points = 0, last_point = -infinity.

   b. Iterate through the sorted intervals. For each interval [a, b], if a > last_point, select b as a point to delete, increment points, and set last_point = b.

This will give the minimal number of deletions required.

So, putting it all together:

The steps are:

1. Read input s and x.

2. Compute prefix sums of s.

3. Compute the proper divisors of x.

4. For each d in the proper divisors, collect all intervals [a, b] with sum d.

5. Sort each d's intervals by a, and precompute the min_b array.

6. Collect all candidates [a, b] with sum x.

7. For each candidate, check if it's x-prime by checking for each d's intervals contained within [a, b] using binary search and the min_b array.

8. Collect all x-prime intervals.

9. If none, output 0.

10. Else, sort them by end, and apply the greedy interval covering algorithm to find the minimal points to delete.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

Implementing the steps:

First, compute the prefix sums:

s = input().strip()
x = int(input())

n = len(s)
digits = [int(c) for c in s]
prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(n):
    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + digits[i]

Proper divisors of x:

def get_proper_divisors(x):
    if x == 1:
        return []
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, x):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return divisors

proper_divisors = get_proper_divisors(x)

For each d in proper_divisors, collect intervals [a, b] where sum is d.

pos = defaultdict(list)
for i, val in enumerate(prefix):
    pos[val].append(i)

Then, for each d in proper_divisors:

d_intervals = []

for d in proper_divisors:
    intervals = []
    for a in range(n):
        target = prefix[a] + d
        if target not in pos:
            continue
        for b_plus_1 in pos[target]:
            b = b_plus_1 - 1
            if b >= a and b < n:
                intervals.append( (a, b) )
    # Sort intervals by a, then by b
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    # Precompute min_b array
    m = len(intervals)
    min_b = [0] * m
    if m == 0:
        d_intervals.append( (intervals, min_b) )
        continue
    min_b[-1] = intervals[-1][1]
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        min_b[i] = min(intervals[i][1], min_b[i+1])
    d_intervals.append( (intervals, min_b) )

But this is for each d. Wait, the d_intervals would be a list where each element is a tuple of (sorted intervals for d, min_b array).

Then, for the candidates:

candidates = []

for a in range(n):
    target = prefix[a] + x
    if target not in pos:
        continue
    for b_plus_1 in pos[target]:
        b = b_plus_1 - 1
        if b >= a and b < n:
            candidates.append( (a, b) )

Now, for each candidate (a, b), check if it's x-prime.

x_prime_intervals = []

for (a, b) in candidates:
    # Check if it's a single character
    if a == b:
        x_prime_intervals.append( (a, b) )
        continue
    # Check for each d in proper_divisors
    is_valid = True
    for i in range(len(proper_divisors)):
        d = proper_divisors[i]
        intervals, min_b = d_intervals[i]
        # Check if any interval in intervals is contained within [a, b]
        # Binary search for the first interval where start >= a
        low = 0
        high = len(intervals) - 1
        pos_found = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if intervals[mid][0] >= a:
                pos_found = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        if pos_found == -1:
            # No interval starts >= a
            continue
        # Now, check the minimal b from pos_found onwards
        if min_b[pos_found] <= b:
            is_valid = False
            break
    if is_valid:
        x_prime_intervals.append( (a, b) )

Once we have all x_prime_intervals, sort them by end and apply the greedy algorithm.

if not x_prime_intervals:
    print(0)
else:
    # Sort intervals by end
    x_prime_intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    res = 0
    last = -1
    for (start, end) in x_prime_intervals:
        if start > last:
            res += 1
            last = end
    print(res)

This should solve the problem.

Now, let's test this approach against the examples.

First example:

Input:
116285317
8

x=8, proper divisors are 1,2,4.

The x-prime intervals are '8' (position 4,4), and '53' (positions 5-6, sum 5+3=8). According to the first example.

The algorithm should find these two intervals.

After sorting by end, they are 4-4 (end 4), 5-6 (end 6). The greedy algorithm selects 4, then 6. So two deletions, which matches the sample output.

Second example:

314159265359
1

x=1. The proper divisors are empty, because x=1 has no proper divisors. So the x-prime substrings are those substrings with sum 1 and no proper sub-substrings (which would have sum 1). But since x=1, the x-prime substrings are all single '1's. The input has two '1's, so the algorithm must delete both. The sample output is 2.

Third example:

13
13

The sum of the entire string is 1+3=4, not 13. So no candidates. So output is 0.

Fourth example:

3434343434
7

x=7, proper divisors are 1. So any candidate with sum 7 and containing a '1' is invalid. But the string has no '1's. So the candidates are all substrings summing to 7. But we need to check if any of these candidates have a sub-substring summing to 1. Since there are no '1's, the only way a sub-substring could sum to 1 is if it's a single '1', which doesn't exist. So all candidates of sum 7 would be x-prime. But 7's proper divisor is 1, so any candidate with sum 7 must not have any sub-substring summing to 1.

So, the candidates are substrings summing to 7 and have no '1's. For example, '34' (3+4=7) would be x-prime if there's no sub-substring with sum 1. Since there are no '1's, but their sub-substrings are '3' (sum 3) and '4' (sum 4), which don't divide 7. So '34' is x-prime. Similarly, '43' (4+3=7) would also be x-prime. But the sample output requires us to delete either all 3's or all 4's. The minimal number of deletions is 5. But according to the algorithm, all such '34' and '43' intervals are x-prime. So the algorithm would collect all these intervals and then find the minimal deletions.

The algorithm would generate all x-prime intervals (all pairs '34' and '43' in the string), and then apply the greedy interval covering. Since these intervals are overlapping, the minimal points to delete would be every other character, but since the intervals are pairs (each requiring deletion of either 3 or 4), the minimal is 5.

Thus, the algorithm should work.

Now, the code in Python.

But wait, the code must be optimized for speed and memory.

But in Python, the steps for the proper divisors and precomputing the intervals should be manageable.

Potential optimizations:

- Precompute the pos (prefix sum to indices) once.

- Precompute the intervals for all d's.

- Use binary search in the checking step.

Now, the code:

Implementing all the steps:

But let's code this step by step.

First, read the input:

s = input().strip()
x = int(input())
digits = [int(c) for c in s]
n = len(digits)

Compute prefix sums:

prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(n):
    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + digits[i]

Compute proper divisors:

def get_proper_divisors(x):
    if x == 1:
        return []
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, x):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return divisors

proper_divisors = get_proper_divisors(x)

Precompute pos:

from collections import defaultdict

pos = defaultdict(list)
for idx, val in enumerate(prefix):
    pos[val].append(idx)

Precompute intervals for each d:

d_intervals = []

for d in proper_divisors:
    intervals = []
    for a in range(n):
        target = prefix[a] + d
        if target not in pos:
            continue
        # Find all b_plus_1 such that prefix[b_plus_1] == target and b_plus_1 > a
        for b_plus_1 in pos[target]:
            b = b_plus_1 - 1
            if a <= b < n:
                intervals.append( (a, b) )
    # Sort intervals by a, then by b
    intervals.sort()
    # Precompute min_b array
    m = len(intervals)
    min_b = [0]*m
    if m == 0:
        d_intervals.append( (intervals, min_b) )
        continue
    min_b[-1] = intervals[-1][1]
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        min_b[i] = min(intervals[i][1], min_b[i+1])
    d_intervals.append( (intervals, min_b) )

Generate candidates (sum x):

candidates = []
for a in range(n):
    target = prefix[a] + x
    if target not in pos:
        continue
    for b_plus_1 in pos[target]:
        b = b_plus_1 - 1
        if a <= b < n:
            candidates.append( (a, b) )

Check each candidate for being x-prime:

x_prime = []

for a, b in candidates:
    if a == b:
        x_prime.append( (a, b) )
        continue
    is_x_prime = True
    for i in range(len(proper_divisors)):
        d = proper_divisors[i]
        intervals, min_b_list = d_intervals[i]
        # Binary search for the first interval in intervals with a >= current a
        left = 0
        right = len(intervals) - 1
        pos_found = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if intervals[mid][0] >= a:
                pos_found = mid
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        if pos_found == -1:
            continue
        # Check if any interval from pos_found onward has b <= current b
        if min_b_list[pos_found] <= b:
            is_x_prime = False
            break
    if is_x_prime:
        x_prime.append( (a, b) )

Sort x_prime intervals by end:

x_prime.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

Greedy interval covering:

result = 0
last_end = -1

for start, end in x_prime:
    if start > last_end:
        result += 1
        last_end = end

print(result)

This code should work.

Testing against sample input 1.

Another example: input '3434343434', x=7. The proper divisors are [1]. The code will check for each candidate (sum 7) if any intervals of sum 1 are contained within them. Since the string has no 1's, all such candidates are x-prime. These candidates are all '34' and '43' pairs, which sum to 7. Each such pair has no substrings summing to 1. So all are x-prime. The code will collect all these intervals and then apply the greedy algorithm. The minimal deletions required would be 5 (since each pair requires a deletion, and overlapping pairs can be handled by deleting the end of each).

The code should output 5.

Thus, the code should be correct.
