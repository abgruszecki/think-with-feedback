<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum time to travel from city s to t with at most k car changes in each round. Each car has different times for each road between cities.

First, let's understand the constraints. The cities are up to 60, cars up to 60, and rounds up to 1e5. Oh right, and each round has k up to 1000. So we need an efficient way to handle multiple queries quickly.

Wait, the main challenge here is to model the problem in such a way that for each query (s, t, k), we can compute the minimal time. The key is that we can switch cars up to k times. So the state during the journey could involve the current city and the current car being used, along with the number of changes left. Because each time we switch cars, it counts against the k limit.

But modeling this directly might be tricky. Let's think of dynamic programming. Like, for each city, car, and number of changes used, we track the minimal time to reach there. Then, for each step, we can either continue using the same car or switch to another (if we have changes left).

But with n=60, m=60, and k up to 1000, the DP state would be 60 * 60 * 1001 = around 3.6 million states per query. And with 1e5 queries, that's way too slow. So we can't process each query individually with this approach.

Hmm. So we need a pre-processing step that allows us to answer queries quickly. Let's think differently. For each car, precompute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities using that car. Then, the problem becomes finding a combination of up to k+1 different cars (since each change allows a new car, but you start with one) and transitions between their paths.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem as a state where each node is a combination of city and current car. Then, transitions can be moving along the current car's edges (without changing cars) or switching to a different car (costing a change). But with m=60, the state space becomes 60n * (k+1) which is 60*60=3600 per city and change level. But for each possible k up to 1000, this would be 3600 * 1000 = 3.6 million states. But for each query, this is O( (k+1)*m^2 * n ) which might be manageable if precomputed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each possible number of changes allowed (up to 1000), precompute some structures. But that seems challenging since k can be up to 1000.

Wait, another angle: the maximum number of changes allowed in a query is 1000, but perhaps the minimal path doesn't require all those changes. For example, in the first sample input, even with k=3, the optimal path uses only two changes. So maybe for each query, we can find the minimal time by considering all possible numbers of changes up to min(k, m-1) since each change allows using a new car, but you can't have more changes than the number of cars minus one.

But even that doesn't immediately suggest a solution.

Alternatively, consider that for each possible number of changes (from 0 to k), the problem is to find a path that uses up to that many changes. So perhaps the minimal time for a query with k changes is the minimal time over all possible allowed changes (0 to k). But how to compute that.

Wait, here's an idea. Let's model this as a layered graph. Each layer represents the number of car changes used so far. For example, layer 0 allows 0 changes (you start with a car and can't change), layer 1 allows 1 change, etc., up to layer k_max (which is 1000). Then, for each layer, each node is a (city, car) pair. But building such a graph for up to 1000 layers is going to be too memory-intensive, especially with 60 cars and 60 cities.

But perhaps we can model it with a dynamic programming approach where for each city and number of changes, we track the minimal time to reach it using any car. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the state could be (city, changes_used, current_car). But again, for 60 cities, 60 cars, and 1000 changes, this is 60*60*1001 = 3,600,600 possible states. For each state, transitions would be either moving using the current car (no change) or switching to another (incrementing changes_used by 1). But even that, for each state, the transitions can be O(m) for switching cars or O(n) for moving to adjacent cities. This might be manageable if precomputed, but perhaps not given the time constraints.

Wait, but each query has a different k. So we can't precompute for all possible k up to 1000. So this approach would require processing each query with BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm each time, but with 1e5 queries, each taking O((n*m*k) log (n*m*k)) time, that's way too slow.

Hmm. So we need a way to preprocess data such that each query can be answered in O(1) or O(m) time. Let's think again.

Another angle: For each possible pair of cities (s, t), and for each possible number of changes allowed (from 0 to 1000), precompute the minimal time. But with n=60, there are 60*60=3600 pairs, and 1001 possible k values. That's 3600 * 1001 = ~3.6 million entries. But how to compute this efficiently.

But how to compute this for all possible pairs and k values. That's the challenge.

Wait, perhaps the key observation is that when the number of allowed changes is k, the maximum number of cars you can use is k+1. So for example, with 0 changes, you can use one car. With 1 change, two cars, etc. So the minimal time for s to t with k changes is the minimal time over any sequence of up to k+1 cars, where each transition between cars requires a change (which is allowed as per the k limit).

But how to model this. Maybe the minimal time can be found by considering transitions between the precomputed all-pairs shortest paths for each car.

For example, suppose we precompute for each car, the all-pairs shortest paths. Let's call this dist[c][i][j], which is the minimal time to go from city i to j using car c.

Then, for any path that uses a sequence of cars c1, c2, ..., cm (with m-1 changes), the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive cities using each car. The problem is to find a path that starts at s, ends at t, uses at most k changes (so up to k+1 cars), and the sum of the segments is minimized.

But how to model this. Let's think in terms of dynamic programming. For each city and each car and number of changes used, track the minimal time to reach that city with that car and that number of changes.

But perhaps we can model it as follows: dp[changes][city][car] = minimal time to reach 'city' using 'car' with 'changes' number of changes made.

Then, for changes=0, it's the distance from s to city using the initial car (so for each car, the initial state would be the distance from s to city using that car, but the initial car is chosen when we start, so perhaps we need to start with all possible cars and track how changes are used).

Wait, maybe for each query (s, t, k), we can compute the minimal time by considering all possible sequences of cars, up to k+1 cars, and for each possible car at the end, compute the minimal time to reach t via that car with up to k changes.

But how to model transitions between cars. Let's say, for each step, when you switch cars, you can start a new segment. Each segment is a path from some city u to v using a particular car. Then, the transitions would involve switching cars at some intermediate city.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the DP approach again. Let's model the state as (current_city, current_car, num_changes). The initial state is (s, any car, 0 changes if we start with that car). But since we can choose the first car, for the initial state, we need to consider all possible cars as the starting car, and track the number of changes as 0 (since no changes have been made yet). Then, for each state, we can either:

1. Move to a neighboring city using the current car. This would update the time but not the number of changes or current car.
2. Switch to a different car at the same city. This would increment the number of changes (if possible) and set the current car to the new one. The time would stay the same (since changing cars takes 0 time).

The goal is to reach the destination city (t) with any number of changes up to k.

But the problem is that the transitions can involve moving along any path for the current car. So for option 1, moving to a neighboring city using the current car's edges would require knowing the minimal time to get from the current city to any other city using that car. So perhaps precomputing all-pairs shortest paths for each car is necessary.

Ah right! For each car, the roads form a weighted directed graph (since the time from j to k might be different than from k to j). So for each car c, we need to compute the all-pairs shortest paths using that car's roads. Once we have that, then moving from city u to v with car c would take dist[c][u][v] time.

So for the DP, when we are in city u with car c and have made x changes, the transitions would be:

- For any other car c_new (different from c), we can switch to c_new at city u, provided that x+1 <= k. The number of changes becomes x+1, and the time remains the same as before (since changing cars is instantaneous). But this transition's cost is zero time.
- Then, from city u, using car c_new, we can go directly to any city v via the precomputed dist[c_new][u][v]. But this would take time dist[c_new][u][v], which is the minimal time to get from u to v using car c_new.

Wait, but perhaps the way to model this is as follows:

For each state (current_city, current_car, num_changes), the minimal time to reach that state is stored. Then, transitions are:

1. Switch car: For each possible car c_new != current_car, if num_changes < k, then a new state is (current_city, c_new, num_changes + 1) with the same time. If this is better than the current known time for that state, update it.

2. Use the current car to go to any other city: For each possible city v, the time increases by dist[current_car][current_city][v]. The state transitions to (v, current_car, num_changes) with the new time.

But wait, the problem is that moving from u to v using the current car's edges would take the minimal time between u and v using that car, not necessarily a direct edge. Because the car's roads form a graph, so the minimal time from u to v is already captured in the all-pairs shortest paths.

So in this model, when considering transitions for using the current car, we can directly jump from u to any city v via the minimal path for that car, paying the cost of dist[current_car][u][v].

This is a key insight. Because instead of moving step by step along the roads, we can precompute all the possible direct paths between any two cities for each car, and then model transitions between cities as moving directly via those precomputed distances.

This reduces the number of transitions, as we don't have to consider each individual road, but can consider the entire all-pairs shortest paths.

So the DP approach would be:

Initialize for each car c, the starting city s. The initial state is (s, c, 0) with time dist[c][s][s] (which is zero). Then, for each possible state, we can either:

- Switch to another car (if changes left), adding a new state with num_changes +1.
- Use the current car to move to any other city, paying the cost of the precomputed distance.

But how do we process these transitions efficiently?

This sounds like a Dijkstra's algorithm approach, where each state is a node in a priority queue. We start with all possible initial cars (since the initial car can be any of the m options, and each starts at s with 0 changes), and then explore transitions, updating the minimal times.

But for each query (s, t, k), this approach would require running a Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with O(m*n*(k+1)) nodes. With n=60, m=60, k=1000, that's 60*60*1001 = 3,600,600 nodes per query. And with 1e5 queries, this is impossible.

So this approach is not feasible for large r (1e5). Thus, we need a way to preprocess all possible (s, t, k) combinations so that queries can be answered quickly.

But the problem is that s and t can be any pair of cities, and k can be up to 1000. Preprocessing all possible (s, t, k) pairs would take O(n^2 * k_max) space, which for n=60 and k_max=1000 is 60*60*1001 = ~3.6 million entries. That's manageable. So if we can precompute for each (s, t, k) the minimal time, then answering queries would be O(1).

But how to compute this for all possible (s, t, k) pairs efficiently.

Let's think again. The key is that for a given k, the minimal time is the minimal over any possible sequence of up to k+1 cars. So for each s and t, we can model the problem as finding the minimal path that allows up to k transitions between cars.

But how to model this with dynamic programming that allows us to compute for all k up to 1000.

An alternative approach is inspired by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Let's consider that the minimal time for up to x changes is built upon the minimal times for x-1 changes.

But I'm not sure. Another idea is to model the problem as a matrix multiplication-like approach. For each possible k, the minimal time for k changes can be obtained by combining the minimal times for fewer changes.

Let me think. Suppose we have a matrix that represents the minimal time to get from any s to t with exactly x changes. Then, to compute x+1 changes, we can consider adding another change.

Alternatively, for each possible x (number of changes allowed), the minimal time can be found by allowing up to x changes. So for x=0, the answer is the minimal time over all cars' distances from s to t. For x=1, it's the minimal time by using two different cars, possibly with a switch in between. And so on.

But how to model this. Let's think for x=0: the answer is min_c (dist[c][s][t]). For x=1: the minimal time is the minimal for any possible two cars c1 and c2, where you go from s to u using c1, then switch to c2 at u (cost 0) and then go from u to t using c2. The total time is dist[c1][s][u] + dist[c2][u][t]. The minimal over all possible u, c1, c2.

This is similar to matrix multiplication where each element is the minimal sum of two steps.

Wait, this seems promising. Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem where dp[x][i][j] is the minimal time to get from i to j with exactly x changes. But perhaps it's better to model it as the maximum number of changes allowed. For example, for k=0, it's the same as x=0.

Alternatively, for each k (the maximum allowed changes), the minimal time is the minimal over all x from 0 to k of the minimal time with x changes. Because using more changes might not help, but we can use up to k.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Here's an approach inspired by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and matrix exponentiation:

1. Precompute for each car c, the all-pairs shortest paths. This is a O(m * n^3) operation, which for m=60, n=60 is 60 * 60^3 = 60*216000 = 12,960,000 operations. That's manageable.

2. For each possible number of changes allowed (from 0 up to the maximum possible, which is 1000), compute a 3D array where dp[k][i][j] is the minimal time to get from i to j with up to k changes allowed.

The recurrence would be:

- For k=0: dp[0][i][j] = min over all cars c of dist[c][i][j].

- For k >=1: dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], min over all u and all possible splits between changes. For example, using up to k-1 changes from i to u, and then one more change to switch cars and go from u to j with 0 changes (since we've used the k-th change at u). So the minimal would be min over u ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_c (dist[c][u][j] )) )

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think again.

Alternatively, for each k, the dp[k] can be computed by allowing one more change. So for each i and j, dp[k][i][j] is the minimum between dp[k-1][i][j] (using up to k-1 changes) and the minimal of (dp[k-1][i][u] + min_c (dist[c][u][j])) for all u. Because the last change could be at u, switching to any car c to go from u to j, adding that to the time to reach u with k-1 changes.

But this approach would be O(n^3) for each k. If k is up to 1000, that's 1000 * 60^3 = 21,600,000 operations. Which is manageable.

Wait, but this approach might not capture all possibilities. For example, using multiple changes in between. But perhaps the way this recurrence is structured allows us to capture all possible numbers of changes up to k.

Because, when we compute dp[k], we are considering the best way to reach j from i with up to k changes. So for each u, we can reach u with up to k-1 changes, then make a change (the k-th) to any car and go to j. So this captures all possibilities where the last change is at u. But since we're taking the minimum over all possible u, this should capture all possible paths with up to k changes.

So the recurrence would be:

dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], min_{u} ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_c ( dist[c][u][j] )) )

This makes sense because:

- The first term (dp[k-1][i][j]) represents not using the k-th change.
- The second term represents using the k-th change at some city u, which allows us to take the best possible path from i to u with up to k-1 changes, then switch cars (costing one change) and go from u to j with the best possible car for that leg (without any more changes).

But the problem here is that the second term requires for each u, the minimal time from u to j with any car (since after switching, you can use that car's best path). So for each u, compute min_c ( dist[c][u][j] ), then add that to the time to reach u with up to k-1 changes.

So to compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each u and j the minimal time from u to j using any car. Let's call this min_dist[u][j] = min_c ( dist[c][u][j] )

Then, the recurrence becomes:

dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], min_{u} ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] ) )

This way, for each k, we can compute dp[k] based on dp[k-1] and the precomputed min_dist.

Now, let's see the steps:

1. Precompute all-pairs shortest paths for each car. Since the roads for each car form a directed graph (possibly with different weights for j to k and k to j), we need to run Floyd-Warshall for each car. For each car c, run Floyd-Warshall on the adjacency matrix of that car. This is O(m * n^3) time, which is acceptable.

2. Precompute min_dist[i][j] for all i, j. min_dist[i][j] is the minimal time from i to j using any single car. So for each i, j, take the minimum over all cars c of dist[c][i][j].

3. Initialize dp[0] as min_dist, since with 0 changes, you can use any car's path once.

Wait, no. For k=0, the maximum number of changes allowed is 0, which means you can't change cars. So the path must use a single car. So the minimal time for k=0 is the minimal over all cars' distances from i to j. Which is exactly min_dist[i][j]. So yes, dp[0] is min_dist.

Then, for each k from 1 to the maximum possible (1000), compute dp[k] based on dp[k-1].

The recurrence is:

For each i, j:

dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], min over u of ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] ) )

But how to compute the min over u? For each i and j, we need to find the minimum value of ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] ) for all u.

But this is equivalent to matrix multiplication where the operation is (min, +). So the entire step for each k can be computed as a matrix multiplication of dp[k-1] and min_dist, using the (min, +) semiring.

However, for each k, the computation is O(n^3), which is manageable for k up to 1000. Let's compute the numbers:

n=60, m=60, k=1000.

- Floyd-Warshall for each car: 60 * 60^3 = 12,960,000 operations.
- Precompute min_dist: 60*60*60=216,000 operations (for each i,j, check all m cars)
- For each k from 1 to 1000: compute for all i,j the min between dp[k-1][i][j] and the min over u of dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j]. For each k, this is O(n^3) time. 1000 * 60^3 = 21,600,000 operations.

Total operations: around 34,776,000. Which should be manageable within the time limit.

Once all dp[k][i][j] are precomputed, for each query (s, t, ki), we can answer by taking dp[ki][s][t], but also considering that ki might be larger than the maximum precomputed k. Wait, but if the maximum k allowed in queries is 1000, then we precompute up to k=1000. However, what if ki exceeds 1000? But according to the input constraints, ki can be up to 1000, so we precompute up to k=1000.

So for each query (s, t, k), the answer is the minimal time in dp[k][s][t], but actually, the recurrence is built such that dp[k][s][t] represents the minimal time with up to k changes. So the answer is indeed dp[k][s][t].

But wait, in the recurrence:

dp[k] is computed as the minimum between the previous dp[k-1] and the new paths that use exactly one more change. So dp[k] is the minimal between using up to k-1 changes or using exactly k changes. Thus, the recurrence builds dp[k] as the minimal possible up to k changes.

Wait, no. Let's think again. For each k, dp[k][i][j] is the minimal time to go from i to j with at most k changes. So when we compute dp[k], we allow using up to k changes. So the recurrence allows for using up to k changes, not exactly k.

So the way we compute dp[k] is:

dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], min_{u} ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] ) )

The first term is the case where we use up to k-1 changes. The second term is the case where we use up to k changes: one change at u. But in the second term, dp[k-1][i][u] can have up to k-1 changes, and then one change is used when switching to the best car for the u to j leg. So total changes is (k-1) +1 =k.

So yes, dp[k] allows up to k changes.

Thus, after precomputing dp[0], dp[1], ..., dp[1000], for each query, we can answer by looking up dp[k][s][t].

But wait, what if k is larger than 1000? According to the input constraints, k can be up to 1000, so no. The maximum precomputed k is 1000.

But what if after a certain k_max, the dp[k][i][j] stops improving? For example, when k is larger than n-1 (since a path can't have more changes than the number of cities minus 1). In that case, further increases in k will not affect the answer. So in practice, for k values larger than m-1 (since you can't change to more cars than you have), the answer would not improve. But according to the problem statement, m can be up to 60. So for k >= m-1, the answer would be the same as for k=m-1. But since the input allows k up to 1000, which can be larger than m-1, we need to handle that.

But in the precomputation, the dp[k] for k up to 1000 is computed. But for k >= (m-1), the min_dist can't be improved further. For example, if there are m cars, the maximum number of changes you can make is m-1 (since each change uses a new car, but you can't have more changes than cars). However, the problem allows up to 1000 changes, which might be larger than m-1. So for these k values, the answer would be the same as for k=m-1.

But in the precomputation steps, since we compute up to k=1000, for those k where k >= m-1, the dp[k] would have already captured the minimal possible value. So, for example, once k reaches m-1, further increases in k would not change the dp[k] matrix, since no more changes are possible. So in the code, during the precomputation, for k from 1 to 1000, if during the computation of dp[k] for some i,j, the value doesn't change from dp[k-1][i][j], then further steps will not improve it. But this is not handled in the current approach. However, in the code, even if k is larger than necessary, the code will still compute the dp[k] correctly, but in practice, after a certain k, the values will stop changing.

But given that the code is allowed to handle up to k=1000 as per the input constraints, this approach is correct.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute the all-pairs shortest paths for each car.

2. Precompute min_dist as the minimal time between any two cities using a single car.

3. Precompute dp[k] for all k from 0 to 1000.

4. For each query (s, t, k), output dp[k][s][t].

Now, implementing this:

First, the Floyd-Warshall for each car. Let's note that each car's matrix is n x n, and for each car, we have to compute the shortest paths from i to j for all i, j.

Then, for each car c:

Initialize dist[c][i][j] as the input value.

Then, run Floyd-Warshall:

for k in 0..n-1:
    for i in 0..n-1:
        for j in 0..n-1:
            dist[c][i][j] = min( dist[c][i][j], dist[c][i][k] + dist[c][k][j] )

Wait, but the input is 1-based. So cities are numbered 1 to n. So in code, we need to adjust for 0-based indices.

Then, after all cars' dist matrices are computed, compute min_dist[i][j] = min( dist[c][i][j] for all c in 0..m-1 )

Then, initialize dp as a list of matrices. dp[0] is min_dist.

Then for each k from 1 to 1000:

compute dp[k][i][j] as the minimum between:

- dp[k-1][i][j] (same as previous)
- the minimum over all u of ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] )

But how to compute this efficiently. For each i, j, the new value is the minimum between the current value and the min over u of ( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] )

So for each k, for each i and j, we compute:

temp = min( dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j] for u in 0..n-1 )

then dp[k][i][j] = min( dp[k-1][i][j], temp )

This can be done with a loop over all i, j, u.

But this is O(n^3) per k. For each k, 60^3 = 216,000 operations. 1000 * 216,000 = 216,000,000 operations, which may be tight for Python but manageable if optimized.

So in code, for Python, this should be feasible.

Now, considering the input and output.

The input for the cars is m sets of n x n matrices. Each matrix is n lines, each with n integers.

In code, for each car, read n lines, each with n numbers, and store as a 2D list (0-based).

Once all cars' matrices are read, compute their Floyd-Warshall.

Then compute min_dist.

Then precompute dp[0...1000].

Then process the r queries.

Now, handling the queries. Since each query has s and t, which are 1-based. So subtract 1 to convert to 0-based indices.

k can be up to 1000. So for each query, if k is larger than 1000, cap it to 1000 (but according to the problem statement, the input constraints say 0 ≤ ki ≤ 1000).

So for each query, output dp[k][s-1][t-1].

Now, let's test this approach against the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4 2 3
First car's matrix:

0 1 5 6

2 0 3 6

1 3 0 1

6 6 7 0

After Floyd-Warshall for car 0:

The dist matrix for car 0 would be:

Original matrix:

Row 0: 0,1,5,6

Row 1: 2,0,3,6

Row 2:1,3,0,1

Row3:6,6,7,0

Floyd-Warshall steps:

For car 0:

Check if any paths can be improved via intermediate nodes.

For example, the path from 0 to 3 via 2: dist[0][0][2] + dist[0][2][3] = 5 +1 =6, which is the same as direct. So no improvement.

But for car 0, the dist from 0 to 3 is 6.

For car 1's matrix:

0 3 5 6

2 0 1 6

1 3 0 2

6 6 7 0

Floyd-Warshall for car 1:

Looking for the shortest paths. For example, from 0 to 2:

Original is 5. But 0→1 (3) →2 (1) is 4. So updated to 4.

But in car 1's matrix, row 0 is [0,3,5,6], row 1 is [2,0,1,6], row2 [1,3,0,2], row3 [6,6,7,0].

So for car 1:

dist[0][0] =0.

dist[0][1] is 3.

dist[0][2] can be min(5, 3 +1) =4.

dist[0][3] can be 4 (from 0→2 via 0→1→2 (3+1=4) and then 2→3 (2) → total 4+2=6? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, after Floyd-Warshall for car 1:

We have to compute all pairs.

For example, dist[0][3] for car 1:

Original is 6.

Check possible intermediate nodes:

Via node 1: 0→1 (3) →1→3 (6) → total 9. No improvement.

Via node 2: 0→2 (5) →2→3 (2) → total 7. So original 6 is better.

But wait, after Floyd-Warshall for car 1, what's the shortest path from 0 to 3 for car 1?

Maybe there's a better path. Let me compute it.

After Floyd-Warshall:

Initially, the dist matrix for car 1 is:

Row 0: [0,3,5,6]

Row 1: [2,0,1,6]

Row 2: [1,3,0,2]

Row3: [6,6,7,0]

Floyd-Warshall steps for car 1:

For each k in 0..3 (assuming 0-based):

For k=0 (intermediate node 0):

No change since all paths via 0 are same.

For k=1 (intermediate node 1):

Check if i→k + k→j is better than i→j.

For example, i=2, j=0: current is 1. Using k=1: 2→1 (3) + 1→0 (2) →5, which is worse than 1. So no change.

For i=0, j=2: current 5. i→k (0→1) is 3, k→j (1→2) is1 → sum 4. So update to 4.

So after k=1, dist[0][2] becomes 4.

For k=2:

Now, with intermediate node 2.

For i=0, j=3: current 6. i→2 (4) + 2→3 (2) =6. Same as current. No change.

For i=1, j=3: current 6. i→2 (1) + 2→3 (2) →3. So update dist[1][3] to 3.

For k=3:

Now, using intermediate node 3.

For i=0, j=3: 0→3 is 6. No better paths via node3.

So after all steps, the dist for car 1 becomes:

Row0: [0,3,4,6]

Row1: [2,0,1,3]

Row2: [1,3,0,2]

Row3: [6,6,7,0]

So min_dist[i][j] is the minimum between car0 and car1.

For example, min_dist[0][3] is min(6 (car0) vs 6 (car1)) →6. But in the sample input, the first query is 1→4 (which is 0→3 in 0-based) with k=2. The answer is 3.

Wait, according to the first sample's first query, the answer is 3. How does that fit into this approach?

Hmm. Let's see:

In the first sample, the correct path is 1 →2 →3 →4 (cities 0→1→2→3 in 0-based). For car0, 0→1 is 1 (car0), then 1→2 using car0's time is3, then 2→3 is1. Total 1+3+1=5. But the sample's answer is 3. So perhaps using different cars.

Ah, the path uses car changes. For example, start with car0, switch to car1, then switch back to car0.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, the first round uses (1,2,1) cars. So maybe:

From city1 (0) to city2 (1) using car1: time3. Then switch to car2 (but there are two cars). Oh wait, in the first sample, m=2. So cars 0 and 1.

So perhaps:

- s=1 (0-based), t=4 (3 in 0-based).

Path:

0→1 using car0: time1.

Switch to car1 at 1.

1→2 using car1: time1. Then switch to car0 at 2.

2→3 using car0: time1.

But this would involve two changes. With k=2 allowed.

The total time would be 1 +1 +1 =3.

But according to our approach, the precomputed dp[2][0][3] should capture this.

But according to the dp approach:

For k=2, the dp[2][0][3] is the minimal time.

But according to the way we compute dp[k], it's the minimal time allowed with up to k changes.

So let's see how the precomputed matrices would capture this.

The dp[0] is min_dist[i][j], which for i=0 to j=3 is the minimum of car0's dist and car1's dist.

For car0, the dist from 0 to3 is6 (original path). For car1, the dist is6. So min_dist[0][3] is6.

Then for k=1:

dp[1][0][3] = min(6, min over u of dp[0][0][u] + min_dist[u][3} )

For each u:

dp[0][0][u] is the minimal time to reach u with 0 changes. For u=0, it's0. u=1: min of car0 (1) and car1 (3) →1. u=2: min between car0's 5 and car1's4 →4. u=3: 6.

min_dist[u][3} is min between car0 and car1's dist from u to3.

For u=0: min_dist[0][3} =6.

u=1: min_dist[1][3} is min(car0's 6 and car1's3) →3.

u=2: min_dist[2][3} is min(car0's1, car1's2) →1.

u=3: 0.

So for each u:

dp[0][0][u] + min_dist[u][3}:

u=0: 0 +6=6.

u=1:1+3=4.

u=2:4+1=5.

u=3:6+0=6.

The minimum is4 (u=1).

So dp[1][0][3} = min(6,4) →4.

For k=2:

dp[2][0][3} = min(4, min over u of dp[1][0][u} + min_dist[u][3} )

Compute for each u:

dp[1][0][u} is the minimal time to reach u with up to 1 change.

For u=3, it's4.

But let's compute for all u:

dp[1][0][u} for u=0 is0.

u=1: min(1 (from dp[0][0][1}=1), and any possible changes. For dp[1][0][1}, since k=1 allows up to1 change. So when k=1, the value is the same as u=1's min_dist[0][1} (1), but maybe via a change.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's proceed.

For each u:

dp[1][0][u} + min_dist[u][3}:

For u=0: dp[1][0][0} is0 (since you can just stay at 0). min_dist[0][3}=6 → sum 6.

For u=1: dp[1][0][1} is1 (the minimal time to reach 1 with up to1 change). min_dist[1][3}=3 → sum4.

For u=2: dp[1][0][2} is the minimal time to reach 2 with up to 1 change. Which is min of the previous step (k=0) which was4, and any possible paths with one change. For example, reach u via a change.

But dp[1][0][2} is the min between dp[0][0][2} (4) and the min over v of (dp[0][0][v} + min_dist[v][2}).

So for k=1, when computing dp[1][0][2}:

the previous value was4 (from k=0). The new possibility is the min over v of (dp[0][0][v} + min_dist[v][2}).

dp[0][0][v} is the minimal time to reach v with 0 changes (min_dist[0][v}).

min_dist[v][2} is the minimal time from v to2 with any car.

So for v=0: min_dist[0][2} is4 (from car1's 4). dp[0][0][0} is0 →0+4=4.

v=1: dp[0][0][1} is1. min_dist[1][2} is min(car0's3, car1's1) →1. Sum1+1=2.

So the min over v is2. So dp[1][0][2} is min(4, 2) →2.

So for u=2 in k=2 computation:

dp[1][0][u=2} is2. min_dist[u=2][3} is1. Sum 2+1=3.

So for k=2, the min over u of ( dp[1][0][u} + min_dist[u][3} ) is min for u=0:6, u=1:4, u=2:3, u=3:4 (since dp[1][0][3} is4). So the minimum is3. Then dp[2][0][3} is min(4 (previous) and3) →3.

Which matches the sample's first output.

So this approach works.

Thus, the code should correctly handle this case.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, read n, m, r.

Then read m matrices, each of size n x n. Each matrix is read as a list of lists.

Then, for each car, compute the Floyd-Warshall.

Then compute min_dist[i][j] as the minimal distance over all cars.

Then compute dp[0...1000].

But storing a 3D array for dp may be memory intensive. Since for n=60 and k=1000, each dp[k] is a 60x60 matrix, so total memory is 1001 * 60*60 = 3,603,600 entries, each stored as an integer. For Python, this is manageable.

But in practice, since for each k, we only need the previous k-1's data, we can optimize space by keeping only two layers: current and previous. But for Python, even using a list of lists for each k is manageable.

But to save space, we can compute the dp in a rolling manner. We can have two 2D arrays: prev and current. For each k, compute current based on prev, then swap them for the next iteration.

Yes, this is more efficient. So:

Initialize prev as min_dist.

For k from 1 to 1000:

   create current as a new 2D array.

   for each i in 0..n-1:

       for each j in 0..n-1:

           current[i][j] = prev[i][j]

           for u in 0..n-1:

               candidate = prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

               if candidate < current[i][j]:

                   current[i][j] = candidate

   prev = current

But wait, no. Because for each k, current[i][j] is the minimum between prev[i][j] (which is dp[k-1][i][j}) and the minimum over u of (prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j}).

So in code:

prev is dp[k-1}

current is initialized as a copy of prev.

Then, for each i, j:

current[i][j] = min( prev[i][j}, min_{u} ( prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j} ) )

But to compute the min over u, we need to loop through all u.

Thus, for each i, j:

current[i][j] = prev[i][j]

for u in 0..n-1:

   candidate = prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

   if candidate < current[i][j]:

       current[i][j] = candidate

But this is O(n^3) per k. For n=60, this is 60*60*60 = 216,000 operations per k. For k=1000, 216,000,000 operations. Which may be manageable in Python if optimized.

But in Python, nested loops are slow. So for n=60, 1e5 queries, and 1e3 k steps, this may be tight.

Alternative approach: precompute for all k up to 1000, but for each k, compute the current matrix using the previous one and the min_dist.

But how to speed this up. Perhaps using numpy for the matrices, but assuming that the code must use standard Python.

Alternatively, for each i, j in current, compute the minimum of (prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j]) for all u. For each i, j, this is O(n) operations.

But with n=60, for each i and j, it's 60 operations. So per k step, it's 60*60*60 = 216,000 operations.

But 1e3 steps would be 216 million operations. Which is manageable.

But in Python, loops are not as fast as in C++. So perhaps we need to find a way to optimize this.

Alternatively, for each i, j, compute the minimum of (prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j}) for all u. This can be done using list comprehensions or precomputed tables.

But even with loops, let's proceed.

So the code would look like this:

Read n, m, r.

Read m matrices, each as a list of lists. Then, for each car, compute the Floyd-Warshall.

Then compute min_dist[i][j} as the minimum over all cars.

Initialize prev as a copy of min_dist.

Then, for each k in 1 to 1000:

   create current as a new matrix.

   for each i in 0..n-1:

       for each j in 0..n-1:

           current_val = prev[i][j]

           for u in 0..n-1:

               temp = prev[i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

               if temp < current_val:

                   current_val = temp

           current[i][j] = current_val

   prev = current.copy()

But storing all 1001 matrices is not feasible. So instead, we can have a list of matrices where each entry is the current best for up to k changes. But again, since for each k, we only need the previous step, we can use a rolling array.

Wait, no. For each query, we need to return the value for k, which can be up to 1000. So we need to store all the k steps. For example, after processing k=500, if a query comes with k=500, we need the matrix for k=500. If we only kept the previous step, we couldn't answer all queries. So we need to store all dp[k] matrices.

But storing 1001 matrices of size 60x60 is feasible. For each matrix, 60*60=3600 integers. 1001 matrices: 3,603,600 integers. For Python, which uses about 28 bytes per integer (if stored as a list of lists), this would be around 100MB, which is manageable.

So the code can precompute a list of matrices, where dp[k] is the matrix for up to k changes.

But how to manage this.

Initialize dp as a list of matrices. dp[0] is min_dist.

For each k from 1 to 1000:

   create a new matrix.

   for each i and j:

       new_val = dp[k-1][i][j]

       for u in 0..n-1:

           candidate = dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

           if candidate < new_val:

               new_val = candidate

       new_matrix[i][j] = new_val

   dp.append(new_matrix)

But this is O(1000 * n^3) time.

In Python, this might be slow for n=60, but let's proceed.

Now, let's code this.

But first, implement the Floyd-Warshall for each car.

In Python, for each car:

n = 4, m=2.

For car in 0 to m-1:

   dist = [[ ... ] ... ]

   for k in range(n):

       for i in range(n):

           for j in range(n):

               if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:

                   dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

Then, after all cars are processed, compute min_dist[i][j} = min( car_dist[i][j} for car in 0..m-1 )

Then, compute dp for each k.

Now, let's test the code with the first sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4 2 3

First car's matrix:

0 1 5 6

2 0 3 6

1 3 0 1

6 6 7 0

Second car's matrix:

0 3 5 6

2 0 1 6

1 3 0 2

6 6 7 0

After Floyd-Warshall for each car:

For car 0:

dist[0][0][3] is 6.

For car 1:

dist[0][0][3] is 6.

min_dist[0][3} is6.

But in the sample, the first query is (1,4,2), which is (0,3) in 0-based, k=2.

According to the code, dp[2][0][3} would be3.

Which is correct.

So the code should work.

Now, handling the input.

In the input, each car's matrix is given as n lines, each with n integers.

So for m cars, after the first line, we read m * n lines.

For example, for the first sample input, after the first line, there are 2 cars, each with 4 lines.

So in code:

cars = []

for _ in range(m):

    matrix = []

    for _ in range(n):

        row = list(map(int, input().split()))

        matrix.append(row)

    cars.append(matrix)

Then, for each car, run Floyd-Warshall.

Once all cars are processed, compute min_dist.

Now, implement the code.

Finally, for each query (s, t, k), output dp[k][s-1][t-1}.

But need to handle k up to 1000. So precompute up to k=1000.

Now, let's code this.

The code in Python will be as follows:

Read n, m, r.

Read m matrices.

For each car, compute Floyd-Warshall.

Compute min_dist.

Precompute dp for 0 to 1000.

Process queries.

But in Python, using lists and loops.

But to handle large input, we can use sys.stdin for faster input.

Also, for Floyd-Warshall, the code needs to run for each car.

The code:

import sys

def main():

    n, m, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    cars = []

    for _ in range(m):

        mat = []

        for _ in range(n):

            row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

            mat.append(row)

        # Floyd-Warshall

        for k in range(n):

            for i in range(n):

                for j in range(n):

                    if mat[i][k] + mat[k][j] < mat[i][j]:

                        mat[i][j] = mat[i][k] + mat[k][j]

        cars.append(mat)

    # Compute min_dist

    min_dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            min_dist[i][j] = min(cars[c][i][j] for c in range(m))

    # Precompute dp

    MAX_K = 1000

    dp = [ [ [0]*n for _ in range(n) ] for __ in range(MAX_K+1) ]

    # dp[0] is min_dist

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            dp[0][i][j] = min_dist[i][j]

    for k in range(1, MAX_K+1):

        for i in range(n):

            for j in range(n):

                # Initialize with previous value

                dp[k][i][j] = dp[k-1][i][j]

                # Check all possible u

                for u in range(n):

                    candidate = dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

                    if candidate < dp[k][i][j]:

                        dp[k][i][j] = candidate

    # Process queries

    for _ in range(r):

        s, t, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

        s -= 1

        t -= 1

        k = min(k, MAX_K)

        print(dp[k][s][t])

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

Wait, but the code uses a 3D list for dp, which may be memory-intensive. For example, dp is initialized as a list of 1001 elements, each being a 60x60 list. But for Python, this should be manageable.

However, in the code above, the way of initializing dp is incorrect. Because in Python, using [ [ [0]*n for _ in range(n) ] for __ in range(MAX_K+1) ] would create a 3D list where each k has a 2D array. But when we precompute dp[0], we assign min_dist[i][j] to dp[0][i][j]. Then, for each k from 1 to MAX_K, we compute based on the previous step.

But in the code above, the initial code for the dp array is:

dp = [ [ [0]*n for _ in range(n) ] for __ in range(MAX_K+1) ]

This creates a list of MAX_K+1 matrices, each of size n x n, initialized to 0. Then, for each i,j, dp[0][i][j] is set to min_dist[i][j]. Then, for each k from 1 to MAX_K, for each i,j, dp[k][i][j] is computed as the minimum between dp[k-1][i][j} and the min over u of (dp[k-1][i][u} + min_dist[u][j}).

This should be correct.

But the code may be too slow for the time constraints, especially with nested loops in Python.

But given the problem's constraints (time limit 2 seconds), and the code's complexity of O(mn^3 + r + 1000n^3), this may be tight.

For example, m=60, n=60:

m*n^3 = 60 * 60^3 = 12,960,000.

1000n^3 = 1000 * 60^3 = 216,000,000.

Total operations: 228,960,000.

In Python, each operation is slow. For example, a loop of 200 million operations can take around 20 seconds, which is way over the time limit.

So the code as written will not pass the time constraints.

Thus, we need to optimize the code.

Possible optimizations:

1. Precompute the min_dist matrix.

2. Optimize the Floyd-Warshall implementation.

But the main problem is the 1000 * n^3 loops for the dp. For n=60, this is 1000 * 60^3 = 216 million operations. Which is way too slow in Python.

Alternative approach: precompute for each k up to 1000, but find a way to vectorize or use numpy for faster computations.

But the problem states that the code must not use any external libraries, so numpy is out of the question.

Another idea: since for each k, the computation is based on the previous k-1's dp, and the min over u, which is a matrix multiplication-like operation (min-plus semiring), we can precompute the min_dist once, and then compute the dp matrices using this.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternative approach: for each k, the dp[k] can be computed as the min between dp[k-1] and the matrix product of dp[k-1] and min_dist using the min-plus multiplication.

The min-plus matrix multiplication of two matrices A and B is defined as (A @ B)_{i,j} = min_u (A[i][u] + B[u][j}).

So for each k, the matrix product of dp[k-1] and min_dist (using min-plus) gives the candidate values for using one more change. Then, the dp[k] is the element-wise min between dp[k-1] and this product.

Thus, the code for each k can be written as:

dp[k] = min( dp[k-1], dp[k-1] * min_dist )

But implementing this efficiently.

In Python, to compute the product of two matrices in min-plus semiring:

def min_plus_mult(a, b):

    n = len(a)

    res = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            for u in range(n):

                res[i][j] = min(res[i][j], a[i][u] + b[u][j])

    return res

But this is O(n^3) per multiplication.

But since this is what the code is already doing for each k, there's no improvement.

So the code as written will not work within the time constraints for large inputs.

Thus, the code needs to be optimized. Let's think of possible optimizations.

One possible optimization is to precompute the min_dist once and note that after a certain k_max, the dp matrices stop changing. For example, once the optimal path uses all possible cars, further increases in k will not help. But how to find that k_max.

The maximum possible number of useful changes is m-1, since each change can switch to a new car, but after m-1 changes, you've used all m cars. Thus, for k >= m-1, the dp[k] matrix will be the same as dp[m-1}.

But in the problem statement, m can be up to 60, so m-1 is 59. Thus, for k >= 59, the dp[k] matrix will not change. So for any query with k >= 59, the answer is dp[59][s][t}.

Thus, the code can be optimized by precomputing up to k= min(1000, m-1).

But according to the problem statement, ki can be up to 1000, which may be larger than m-1. So this optimization reduces the maximum k steps from 1000 to m-1.

For example, if m=60, then the maximum k steps are 59. Which reduces the loops from 1000 to 59, leading to 59 * 60^3 = 12,744,000 operations.

Which is manageable.

So the code can be optimized by precomputing up to k= min(1000, m-1).

Wait, but m can be 1. So in that case, no changes are possible. Thus, for any k, the answer is min_dist[s][t}.

But in the code, for m=1, the min_dist is the same as the single car's distance matrix, and the dp[k} for any k will be the same as min_dist.

Thus, the optimization is:

max_k = min(1000, m-1)

precompute up to max_k steps. For k > max_k, use dp[max_k}.

Thus, in the code, after precomputing up to max_k, the queries with k > max_k can be answered using dp[max_k}.

This reduces the number of steps from 1000 to m-1, which is up to 59 steps.

Thus, the code's inner loop becomes:

max_k = min(1000, m-1)

for k in range(1, max_k+1):

    compute dp[k] based on dp[k-1} and min_dist.

Then, for queries with k > max_k, set k = max_k.

This optimization should significantly reduce the computational time.

This is a crucial optimization that makes the code feasible.

So modifying the code to use max_k = min(1000, m-1).

Thus, the code becomes:

import sys

def main():

    n, m, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    cars = []

    for _ in range(m):

        mat = []

        for _ in range(n):

            row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

            mat.append(row)

        # Floyd-Warshall

        for k in range(n):

            for i in range(n):

                for j in range(n):

                    if mat[i][k] + mat[k][j] < mat[i][j]:

                        mat[i][j] = mat[i][k] + mat[k][j]

        cars.append(mat)

    # Compute min_dist

    min_dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            min_dist[i][j] = min(cars[c][i][j] for c in range(m))

    # Precompute dp

    max_k = min(1000, m-1)

    # Initialize dp[0]

    dp = [ [ [0]*n for _ in range(n) ] for __ in range(max_k +1) ]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            dp[0][i][j] = min_dist[i][j]

    # Compute dp for k=1 to max_k

    for k in range(1, max_k +1):

        for i in range(n):

            for j in range(n):

                dp[k][i][j] = dp[k-1][i][j]

                for u in range(n):

                    candidate = dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

                    if candidate < dp[k][i][j]:

                        dp[k][i][j] = candidate

    # Process queries

    for _ in range(r):

        s, t, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

        s -= 1

        t -= 1

        effective_k = min(k, max_k)

        print(dp[effective_k][s][t])

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

This code now precomputes up to max_k = min(1000, m-1) steps. For m=60, this is 59 steps, which is manageable.

Testing this code with the first sample input:

m=2, so max_k is min(1000, 1) =1. Wait, m-1=1. So the code would compute up to k=1.

But in the first sample, the first query has k=2. So the effective_k is min(2, 1)=1, which would return dp[1][0][3}=4, but the correct answer is3.

But this is a problem. Thus, the optimization is incorrect.

Ah, here's the mistake. The maximum number of changes allowed is not m-1. Because the code allows switching to the same car multiple times. For example, in the first sample, the path uses car 1, then car 2, then car 1 again. So even though there are two cars, three segments, two changes. So m-1 is 1, but k=2 is allowed.

Thus, the previous optimization is incorrect. Because the maximum number of changes is not limited by m-1. Because you can switch between different cars as long as you have changes left.

Thus, the previous assumption is wrong. Therefore, the code cannot be optimized by limiting k to m-1.

This is a critical error.

Thus, the code must precompute up to k=1000.

So the previous approach is invalid. Thus, the code is back to being unmanageable for Python.

Thus, we need to find another way to optimize the code.

Alternative idea: realize that even for large k, the minimal path can't have more than n-1 edges. For example, to go from s to t, you can have a path with up to n-1 edges (visiting each city once). Each edge can be in a different car. Thus, the maximum useful number of changes is n-1. But n=60, so for k >=59, the answer is the same as k=59.

Thus, the maximum useful k is min(1000, n-1). For n=60, this is 59.

So for queries with k >=59, the answer is dp[59][s][t}.

Thus, in the code, max_k = min(1000, n-1).

This way, the code precomputes up to 59 steps for n=60.

But why would the maximum useful number of changes be n-1?

Because each change happens at a city. So the path can be split into segments, each using a different car, and each segment is a path from one city to another. The maximum number of segments is the number of cities visited, which can't exceed n.

Thus, the maximum number of changes is n-1.

Thus, for any k >=n-1, the answer is the same as for k=n-1.

Thus, the code can be optimized by precomputing up to k= min(1000, n-1).

Thus, in the code:

max_k = min(1000, n-1)

This would limit the steps to 59 for n=60.

Thus, for the first sample input, n=4, max_k=3. But the first query is k=2, which is allowed.

Thus, the code would compute up to k=3, and for a query with k=2, it would answer correctly.

This optimization is valid.

Thus, the code should be modified to precompute up to k= min(1000, n-1).

Thus, in the code:

max_k = min(1000, n-1)

Now, for n=60, max_k=59. So the code precomputes up to 59 steps.

This reduces the inner loop steps from 1000 to 59, making the code feasible.

Thus, the code becomes:

import sys

def main():

    n, m, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    cars = []

    for _ in range(m):

        mat = []

        for _ in range(n):

            row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

            mat.append(row)

        # Floyd-Warshall

        for k in range(n):

            for i in range(n):

                for j in range(n):

                    if mat[i][k] + mat[k][j] < mat[i][j]:

                        mat[i][j] = mat[i][k] + mat[k][j]

        cars.append(mat)

    # Compute min_dist

    min_dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            min_dist[i][j] = min(cars[c][i][j] for c in range(m))

    # Precompute dp

    max_k = min(1000, n-1)  # Max useful changes is n-1

    # Initialize dp[0]

    dp = [ [ [0]*n for _ in range(n) ] for __ in range(max_k +1) ]

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(n):

            dp[0][i][j] = min_dist[i][j]

    # Compute dp for k=1 to max_k

    for k in range(1, max_k +1):

        for i in range(n):

            for j in range(n):

                dp[k][i][j] = dp[k-1][i][j]

                for u in range(n):

                    candidate = dp[k-1][i][u] + min_dist[u][j]

                    if candidate < dp[k][i][j]:

                        dp[k][i][j] = candidate

    # Process queries

    for _ in range(r):

        s, t, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

        s -= 1

        t -= 1

        effective_k = min(k, max_k)

        print(dp[effective_k][s][t])

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

This code should now handle the first sample correctly.

In the first sample, n=4, max_k=3. For the first query, k=2, which is allowed.

Thus, the code computes up to k=3. But for the first query, the answer is found in dp[2][s][t}.

Thus, this code should work.

But in the first sample, the third query has k=3, which is allowed. The code uses effective_k=3, which is within max_k=3.

Thus, the code should now be correct.

This optimization reduces the number of steps to 59 for n=60, making the code feasible.

Now, testing the code with the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

4 2 3

Car 0's matrix:

After Floyd-Warshall, the dist matrix for car 0 is:

Row 0: 0,1,4,5 (via k=2: 0→2 is 5, but 0→1→2 is 1+3=4. Then 0→2 via 1 is4. Then 0→3 via 2 is4+1=5.

But original sample's first query is s=1, t=4, k=2. Which in code is s=0, t=3, k=2.

max_k is min(1000, 3) =3.

So the code computes dp up to k=3.

For k=2:

dp[2][0][3] is computed as the minimum between dp[1][0][3} and min over u of (dp[1][0][u} + min_dist[u][3}).

Assuming that after k=2, the value is 3, which is correct.

Thus, the code should now work.

Thus, this is the correct solution.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time required to travel from city `s` to city `t` with at most `k` car changes for each round of the competition. Each car type has different travel times between cities, and we can switch cars at any city without any time penalty.

### Approach
1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Precompute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities for each car type using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This helps in efficiently determining the shortest path for each car type.
2. **Minimum Distance Matrix**: Construct a matrix `min_dist` where each entry `min_dist[i][j]` is the minimum travel time from city `i` to city `j` using any single car type.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use dynamic programming to precompute the minimum travel times for up to `k` car changes. The DP state `dp[k][i][j]` represents the minimum time to travel from city `i` to city `j` with at most `k` car changes. This is built iteratively by considering the minimum time either by using the same car or switching cars at intermediate cities.

                        mat[i][j] = mat[i][k] + mat[k][j]
        cars.append(mat)

                    if candidate < dp[k][i][j]:
                        dp[k][i][j] = candidate

    for _ in range(r):

        s -= 1
        t -= 1
        effective_k = min(k, max_k)
        print(dp[effective_k][s][t])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: For each car type, we compute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This is done in O(n^3) time per car type.
2. **Minimum Distance Matrix**: We create a matrix `min_dist` that holds the shortest path between any two cities using any car type. This helps in quickly determining the best car to switch to at any city.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a DP array `dp` where `dp[k][i][j]` is the minimum time to travel from city `i` to city `j` with at most `k` car changes. The DP array is built iteratively by considering either continuing with the current car or switching to a new car at any intermediate city. This is done in O(n^3) time per value of `k`, up to a maximum of `n-1` changes (as more changes do not improve the result).

This approach ensures that we efficiently precompute all necessary values, allowing each query to be answered in constant time by looking up the precomputed DP array.
